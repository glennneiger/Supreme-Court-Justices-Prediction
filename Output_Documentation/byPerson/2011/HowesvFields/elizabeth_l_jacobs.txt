ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
someone
is
free
to
leave.
recently,
there
have
been
several
cases,
and
cervantes
is
one
--
and
i
can't
remember
whether
it
was
alvardo
--
alvarado
or
j.d.b.
--
where
the
courts
have
said
that
in
a
prison
setting
the
statement
that
you
are
free
to
leave
has
less
significance
than
if
you
are
in
the
free
world.
so
i
would
suggest
that
when
you
look
at
this,
that
that
particular
issue,
or
that
particular
statement,
should
not
be
given
the
same
weight
in
prison
as
out.
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
suggest
is
because
if
a
prisoner
is
told
he
is
free
to
leave
and
he's
in
custody
and
we
know
he's
in
custody
because
he's
in
prison,
he
really
under
these
facts
does
not
have
the
capability
of
getting
up
and
leaving--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--right.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
prisoners--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--let
me
answer
that
question
by
pointing
out
that
in
--
i
believe
it's
georgison
and
cervantes
where
there
is
a
button,
and
the
prisoner
has
the
ability
to
go
and
press
the
button
and
call
his
own
jailers.
in
this
case,
the
prisoner
had
to
rely
on
the
sheriff's
deputies
that
were
interrogating
in
order
to
effectuate
his
freedom.
and
in
fact,
he
has
testified
that
he
said
he
wanted
to
--
i
think
he
said
that
he
didn't
want
to
answer
any
questions,
or
he
wanted
to
leave,
and
we
don't
hear
any
more
about
it
--
about
that.
why
not?
because
at
that
point,
no
one
allowed
him
to
leave
because
the
officers
hadn't
gotten
the
answers
they
wanted.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
the
rule
i
want
you
to
adopt
is
the
rule
in
mathis.
and
it
seems
that
it
has
already
been
adopted,
but
i
think
that
based
on
what
the--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--right.
but
if--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--no.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
mathis
said.
i
think
mathis
was
very
specific,
that
a
police
officer
coming
from
the
outside
to
the
inside
to
talk
about
a
crime
occurring
on
the
outside
must
be
given
a
miranda
warning.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
and
in
certain
circumstances,
i
agree
with
you,
that
in
fact,
this
court
should
hold
that
when
the
correction
officers
are
investigating
a
crime
within
the
prison,
then
--
and
they
remove
the
prisoner
and
they
isolate
him,
take
him
out
of
the
general
population,
that
this
court
should
then
hold
miranda
is
applicable.
but
when
it's
voluntary--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
i
mean
--
there
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
possible
crimes.
they
always
turn
out
to
be
crimes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
well,
miranda
--
not
all
the
--
there
are
bright-line
rules
attached
to
miranda,
so
that
miranda
itself
is
a
bright-line
rule.
so
to
stay
a
bright-line
rule
i
don't
think
is
outside
the
purview
of
miranda
--
of
miranda
law.
and
it's
easier
for
the
officers
to
apply;
it's
easier
for
the
courts
to
apply;
and
there
would
be
more
consistency.
but,
justice
alito,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
you
understand
that
i
think
if
it's
on-the-scene
questioning
about
a
crime
occurring
on
prison,
that
i
don't
think
he
has
to
give
miranda
rights;
that
if
it's
voluntary,
if
the
officer
--
if
the
defendant
comes
up
to
an
officer
and
starts
chatting
away
and
starts
mentioning
a
crime,
that's
voluntary.
and
that
is
consistent
with
miranda.
i
don't
think
you
really
have
to
break
new
ground--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--well,
that's
an
interesting
fact
situation,
because
some
of
those
people
are
just
witnesses
and
they
are
not
necessarily
suspects.
and
a
guard
might
be
able
to
say:
well,
the
people
that
were
in
this
narrow
area,
they
are
possible
suspects.
they're
going
to
get--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
--
i'm
sorry,
but
i
had
thought
that
what
miranda
also
said
is
if
it's
a
witness,
and
you
know
--
you
believe
that
it's
a
witness,
and
that
you
are
not
asking
questions
that
are
going
to
incriminate
them,
that
then
you
don't
have
to
give
miranda.
once
the
point
it
becomes
--
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
once
the
point
it
becomes
incriminating,
then
you
give
them
miranda
rights.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
understand,
but
i
thought
your
hypothetical
had
to
do
with
being
stabbed
in
the
yard.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
okay.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
if
they--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--if
they
are
removed
from
the
general
population,
if
they
are
taken
by
a
corrections
officer
to
a
cell
where
they
are
going
to
be
interrogated;
they
are
isolated;
it
is
incommunicado;
they
are
being
interrogated
by
officers;
they
know
they
are
officers
--
they
have
some
miranda
choices--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
--
i
think
at
that
point
they
are
going
to
put
the
people
that
were
in
the
yard
back
in
their
cells.
and
then
they
are
going
to
take
them
out.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
so
they
will
get
miranda.
you're
--
you
know.
and
i
understand
the
court's
concern
that
you
might
lose,
you
might
lose
evidence;
but
miranda
is
going
to
protect
us
from
false
confessions,
which
is
even
a
greater
cost
to
society
than
--
than
having
to
give
the
miranda
rights.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
it's
--
well,
i've
got
two
answers
for
that.
one,
it's
--
it's
the
basis
of
miranda,
that
when
you
isolate
someone,
when
you
talk
to
them
incommunicado,
that
that
--
there
are
compelling
pressures
that
only
miranda
rights
will
dispel.
such
as
--
and
--
let
me
just
answer
one
other
question.
telling
someone
they
have
got
the
freedom
to
leave
is
not
a
substitute
for
miranda.
but
now
let
me
go
back
to
mathis.
in
mathis
the
court
said
he
was
in
a
cell.
so
i
draw
that
--
the
inference
that
he
was
isolated,
that
he's
in
a
cell,
he's
got
agents
with
him,
and
that
that's
isolation.
he's
not
in
a
prison
library--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
read
mathis
as
to
say
that
he
was
in
custody
for
the
--
for
the
question
of
the
crime.
the
police
officers
came
in,
they
have
him
in
a
cell;
it's
a
police-dominated
atmosphere;
and
that
they're
questioning
about
a
crime
that
occurred
outside
the
prison.
to
me,
that's
miranda.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
in
mathis,
because
he
was
--
i
guess
it
was
the
lower
court
thought
that
because
he
was
not
in
custody
on
the
crime
of
which
they
were
going
to
ask
questions--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--that
therefore
you
didn't
have
to
give
him
miranda.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
i
think
what
the
supreme
court
was
implying
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
--
what
you
are
in
--
in
prison
for;
you
are
in
custody
at
that
point
that
you
are
in
the
cell
with
these
officers.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i'm
saying--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
implied
by
mathis.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
you
can
infer
it
from
mathis.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
that--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--yes.
i
think
it
is
clearly
established
law;
it
does
not
break
any
new
ground
for
us
to
apply
it.
it
does
not
break
any
new
ground.
i
think
mathis
is
a
very
limited
case.
the
holding
applies
to
police
by
officers
only,
not
to
corrections
officers,
and
i
think
that
it
does
stand
for
the
principle
that
if
you
are
in
custody,
and
they
are
talking
to
you
about--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
it's
a
rational
--
i
think
it's
a
rational
extension.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
new
law.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
which
court?
this
court,
or
the
sixth
circuit?
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
--
i
read
that
as
still
being
the
law,
that
there
are
the
two
clauses;
one
is
you
are
under
arrest,
and
the
other
is
your
freedom
of
movement
is
restricted
such
that
a
reasonable
person
would
think
that
you
were
not
--
that
you
were
not
free
to
leave.
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg;
have
i
answered
your
question?
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i'm
sorry.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
that
when
--
when
the
sixth
circuit
is
analyzing
the
state
court
decision,
they
are
looking
at
the
state
court
decision,
and
that
decision
says
if
there's
no
nexus
between
what
you
are
being
questioned
about
and
what
you
are
in
custody
for,
then
you
don't
have
to
get
miranda.
so
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
to
be
contrary
to
the
language
in
mathis.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
we
are
arguing
about
two
things.
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide
two
things,
and
one
is
whether
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
about
whether
the
state
court's
decision
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
law,
i
think
that's
one
decision.
and
the
other
decision
is
whether
there
is
going
to
be
this
per
se
rule
about
whether
if
you're
--
whether
you're
in
custody
or
not
and
under
what
circumstances
there
might
be
a
per
se
7
rule.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
whether
--
if
there
is
a
per
se
rule?
there
is
not
a
clearly
established
law.
there
could
be
--
under
a
rational
extension
issue,
but
it's
a
little
more
attenuated.
but
i
don't
think
that
i
--
that
there
--
that
the
respondent
would
lose
on
that
issue.
he
would
still
win,
because
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
is
not
wrong;
the
state
court's
decision
is
contrary
to
the
clearly-established
law
of
mathis.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
they
do,
because
i
think
that
telling
him
that
he
is
free
to
go
is
not
a
substitute
for
miranda.
it
does
not
protect
the
fifth
amendment
right,
and
i
think
we
look
to
dickerson,
which
said
that,
even
though
section
3501
said
that
you
had
to
inform
defendants
of
certain
rights,
it
didn't
cover
all
of
the
miranda
rights.
and
they
said
you
had
to
cover.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
in
the
same
language,
but
you
have
to
cover
those
rights.
i
think
what
the
petitioner
wants
you
to
adopt
is
a
--
is
a
rule
that
says
telling
someone
they're
free
to
go
is
a
substitute
for
miranda;
and
it
isn't.
it
does
not
protect
the
fifth
amendment
right.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
that's
correct.
they
have
taken
him
from
his
normal
routine.
they
have
exercised
control
over
him.
they've
moved
him
to
another
location
where
i'm
assuming
from
justice
alito's
hypothetical
that
he
is
isolated
from
the
general
prison
population.
and
they
are
starting
to
tell
him
they
are
going
to
question
him
about
child
sexual
abuse
charges.
i
don't
see
how
you
can't--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
--
i
think
you
are
now
describing
him
as
being
much
nicer
than
i
had
assumed
he
was
the
first
time
around.
if
the
officer
is
not
being
confrontational,
i
think
maybe
that's
one
thing
that
has
to
be
considered.
i
would
think
that
you
have
to
give
him
miranda
rights.
let
me
just
go
over
a
few
issues
that
i
wanted
to
make
sure
got
mentioned.
the
sixth
circuit
decision,
i
got
kind
of,
i
think,
carried
away
in
my
brief.
the
sixth
circuit
decision
very
clearly
rests
on
the
contrary
clause.
on
page
10
a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
they
state
what
their
decision
is
going
to
be,
that
is,
that
it's
contrary
to
clearly
established
supreme
court
law.
then
they
do
four
more
pages
to
page
14
a
in
which
they
talk
about
why
the
state
court's
decision
was
contrary.
and
it's
only
after
they
say
that
--
they
give
their
reasoning.
they
state
their
rule
that
they
say:
but
if
there's
any
doubt,
then
let's
look
at
shatzer,
which
was
not
clearly
established
law
at
the
time
of
this
case.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
that
that
was
what
you
said
at
the
end.
i
apologize.
i
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
makes
it
very
clear
that
they
are
talking
about
crimes
occurring
outside
the
prisons;
that
they
have
draw
on
that
kind
of
dichotomy.
so--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
thought
that
it
was
between
10
a,
page
10
a
and
page
14
a.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
this
was
the
question
that
we
talked
about
before,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
believe
that
they
are
implying
that
and
were
inferring
that.
and
that
it
might
not
be
a
clearly
stated
principle
that
it's
from
outside
the
prison,
but
that
it
certainly
foreshadows
--
that
that
rule
is
foreshadowed
so
it's
not
unusual
that--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
again
say
that
this
is
what
one
infers
from
mathis.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
that's
the
general
principle.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
no.
custody
is
when
the
prisoner
is
isolated,
incommunicado,
outside
the
general
prison
population,
and
he
is
being
asked
questions
by
law
enforcement
officers
designed
--
that
are
designed
to
incriminate
him.
i
think
it's
the
traditional
miranda--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
what
shatzer
was
saying,
and
i
know
it's
hard
for
me
to
tell
you
what
shatzer
is
saying
since
you
decided
shatzer,
but
i
think
that
shatzer
seems
to
be
aimed
at
correction
officials,
that
whether
correction
officials
--
i
think
shatzer
is
saying
we
never
decided
the
whole
issue.
and
i
think
that
mathis--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--but
i
think--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
think
that
shatzer
was
referring
to
the
whole
umbrella
of
--
of
people
that
would
come
into
the
prison,
including
people
that
would
be
in
the
prison
and
want
to
talk
to
--
to
prisoners.
so
i
think
shatzer
was
talking
about
not
just
police
officers,
but
correction
officials.
i
think
mathis
clears
up
police
officers,
you
come
in,
you
are
going
to
talk
about
something
else,
you
are
going
to
21
interrogate
--
miranda.
shatzer
finishes
this
line
of
cases
by
saying
it
applies
to
--
it
will
apply
to
correction
officials
as
long
as
you
take
the
gentleman
out
of
the
general
prison
population
and
isolate
him.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
think
that
mathis
does
mention
factors
that
went
into
the
decision
about
whether
he
was
in
custody.
they
talk
about
him
being
in
a
cell,
not
in
the
prison
law
library,
not
in
the
conference
room,
not
in
the
visitor's
room
--
being
in
the
cell,
with
the
officers
and
as
being
interrogated.
i
think
that
they
very
clearly
are
saying,
that
this
--
i
think
it's
establishing
this
principle
that
mathis
--
that
my
case
--
that
howes
v.
fields
applies.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
agree.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
i
just
don't
think
--
i
don't
doubt
that
they
thought
that
mathis
was
in
custody,
which
is
why
they
were
talking
about
miranda
to
begin
with.
he's
in
a
cell.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
and
it's
not
dicta;
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
becomes
part
of
clearly
established
law.
it
was
a
court--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--right.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
i
--
my
argument,
justice
roberts,
is
that
saying
that
he
is
in
a
cell
and
that
he
is
being
questioned,
by
officers,
that
that
is
--
and
he's
being
questioned
about
a
crime,
that
that
is
custody;
and
from
that
there
is
a
principle.
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
saying
again
that
i
would
ask
you
to
reject
the
--
the
petitioner's
proposition
that
saying
someone
is
free
to
leave
is
a
substitute
for
miranda
warning;
that
my
client
was
very
clearly
in
custody,
that
in
fact
--
and
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
part
of
this
case
--
in
a
sense
custody
had
been
transferred.
that
he
really
was
no
longer
in
custody
of
the
jail,
but
that
he
had
been
--
once
he
went
through
the
j
door,
was
turned
over
to
the
sheriff's
deputies,
and
the
other
guards
left,
that
custody
of
him
had
been
transferred.
so
i
think
he
is
clearly
in
custody,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
must
look
for
or
include
in
a
per
se
rule,
whether
--
who
is
holding
this
man
in
custody?
further,
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
he
could
leave
is
not
significant
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
fact
that
the
officers
--
and
i
think
justice
kennedy
made
this
point
--
that
the
officers
were
yelling
at
him;
they
are
the
ones
that
have
control
over
him.
he
does
not
have
the
control.
the
fact
that
he
was
missing
his
medication
shows
that
he
did
not
think
that
he
had
the
power
to
change
his
situation.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
no,
i
agree
there
isn't.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
no,
i
agree
that
there
isn't.
but
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
was
playing
on
his
mind,
and
although
i
understand
that
this
is
an
objective
test
and
not
a
subjective
test,
i
think
that
that
lends
credibility
to
his
testimony
at
the
hearing.
harrington
versus--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--i
don't
believe
that
telling
a
prisoner
that
he's
free
--
that
he's
free
to
leave
--
is
a
substitute
for
miranda.
i
think
you
have
to
get
back
to
what
miranda
was
trying
to
protect.
it
was
trying
to
protect
systematic
rights,
and
telling
him
he
is
free
to
leave
does
not
do
that.
so
the
facts
are
not
enough,
and
that
should
be
part
of
the
equation.
now,
they--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--no,
i
don't,
but
i
really
--
really
did
brief
the
case.
and
i'm
sure
that
it
said
that
as
well--
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
--great.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
but
it
definitely
--
it
should
be
talking
about
the
officers,
the
agents
in
the
cell
with
him.
ms.
elizabeth
l.
jacobs
just
as
a
--
as
a
final
comment,
i
just
want
to
say
that
harrington
v.
richter
requires
a
finding
before
a
writ
can
issue
of
an
extreme
malfunction
in
the
justice
system,
that
certainly
where
a
state
court
has
decided
a
constitutional
issue
--
under
supreme
court
law
and
ignores
supreme
court
law,
that
we
really
do
have
an
extreme
malfunction
of
the
supreme
court
decision.
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
send
mr.
fields
back
to
lenawee
county
for
a
new
trial.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
cede
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
the
court.
