except
when
they
say
you
have
to
leave,
one
way
to
interpret
that
or
to
analyze
that
might
be
to
say:
you
are
in
custody
no
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
you
say:
you
have
to
leave,
that's
almost
coercive,
coercive
of
him
to
say,
because
he
doesn't
want
to
have
to
go
back
in
the
cell.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
it
makes
your
case
weaker,
not
stronger,
that
statement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no,
no,
that's
not
the
way
miranda
works.
miranda
suppresses
a
statement
that
is
adverse
to
the
person
who
was
questioned.
and
the
police
doesn't
know
when
the
adverse
statement's
going
to
come.
so
you
are
running
away
from
the
hypothetical.
it
just
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
what
you
infer
is
the
rule
that
incarceration
constitutes
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
shatzer,
and
shatzer
was
careful
to
say
we've
never
decided
that
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
states
in
broader
terms.
it
says
we've
never
decided
whether
incarceration
constitutes
custody
for
miranda
purposes.
and
indeed
they
explicitly
declined
to
address
the
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
talks
about
bradley,
which
was
definitely
litigation.
