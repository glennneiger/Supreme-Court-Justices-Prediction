ms.
ginger
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sixth
circuit
has
imposed
a
per
se
role
that
whenever
a
prison
inmate
is
isolated
for
questioning
about
conduct
that
occurred
outside
the
prison,
that
inmate
is
in
custody
for
miranda
purposes,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
the
interrogation.
but
in
the
prison
context,
as
in
any
other,
the
traditional
miranda
custody
tests
should
apply
and
the
question
should
be
whether,
in
light
of
all
of
the
circumstances,
a
reasonable
person
in
the
suspect's
position
would
have
felt
free
to
terminate
the
interview
and
leave.
that
is
so
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
court
reaffirmed
in
maryland
v.
shatzer
that
restraints
on
a
suspect's
freedom
of
movement
are
a
necessary
but
not
sufficient
condition
for
miranda
custody.
in
other
words,
a
reasonable
suspect
whose
freedom
of
movement
is
restrained
may
nonetheless
feel
that
he
is
free
to
terminate
the
questioning.
second,
there
are
in
fact
many
situations
in
which
a
reasonable
inmate
isolated
for
questioning
would
feel
free
to
terminate
the
interrogation
despite
being
subject
to
background
prison
restrictions.
and
third,
the
sixth
circuit's
per
se
rule
here
requires
miranda
warnings
to
be
given
in
situations
in
which
the
concerns
about
custodial
interrogation
that
drove
miranda
are
simply
not
present.
that
holding
impairs
the
important
truth-seeking
function
of
investigations
by
requiring
the
suppression
of
voluntary
confessions
made
in
noncustodial
situations.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
you
have
to
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--in
that
case.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
in
that
situation
they
may
not
be
in
custody,
because
shatzer
established
that
simply
being
in
prison
and
subject
to
normal
prison--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--you
would
look
to--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
he
may
not
be
in
custody,
because--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--because
again
you
have
to--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--you
look
to
what
the
reasonable
inmate
in
that
situation
would
feel--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--you
would
look
to
what
the
reasonable
inmate
would
feel,
and
in
that
situation
you
would
look
to
his
experience
with
the
prison,
you
would
look
to
the
circumstances
of
the
questioning,
whether
they
are
accusatorial,
whether
they
are
pleasant.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
the
location
of
the
room.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
you
may
have
to
in
that
situation.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
the
difference
is
that
the
person
who
is
on
the
street,
their
baseline
is
that
they
have
complete
free
will,
they
have
freedom
of
movement.
but
when
you
look
at
the
prison
situation,
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
reasonable
inmate
would
feel
free
to
terminate
the
questioning
and
one
situation
you
look
to
in
determining
are
the
physical
restraints
on
that
person.
and
when
you
look
at
the
restraints
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
has
a
baseline,
which
is
that
he
has
some
restrictions
on
his
movement.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
shatzer.
so
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
you
consider
the
restraints
and
the
prisoner's
baseline,
but
you
also
consider
everything
else
that
happens
during
the
questioning.
so
there
could
be
many
situations
in
which
the
questioning
will
go
in
a
manner
that
tells
the
reasonable
inmate
that
he
is
free
to
leave.
for
instance,
the
most
clear
example
is
when
someone
is
actually
told
that
they
can
leave.
but
there
could
be
many
other
examples
as
well.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
the
state
court
opinions
are
somewhat
unclear.
there
some
statements
that
could
be
taken
to
be
inconsistent
with
mathis,
but
immediately
after
those
statements
the
state
court
said:
well,
it's
not
enough
alone
for
custody
that
someone
is
incarcerated
on
a
conviction
that's
unrelated
to
their
questioning;
and
we
look
to
the
fact
that
the
inmate
was
told
that
he
was
free
to
leave
and
he
actually
felt
free
to
leave.
so
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
state
court's
opinions
is
that
they
did
go
through
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
they
did
conclude
that
the
respondent
reasonably
felt
that
he
was
free
to
leave
in
this
interview.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
went
much
further
than
that
and
established
a
per
se
rule
that
says,
no
matter
what
the
questioners
do,
no
matter
what
a
prisoner
is
told
--
told,
no
matter
how
free
he
feels
to
leave,
that
person
always
has
to
be
mirandized.
and
that
extends
miranda
way
beyond
its
initial
concerns.
voluntary
confessions,
this
court
has
recognized,
are
an
unmitigated
good.
so
any
time
someone
confesses
voluntarily
in
a
noncustodial
situation,
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
applied
to
prisons
would
say
that
that
person's
confession
would
has
to
be
suppressed,
even
though
it
was
given
in
a
situation
that
doesn't
implicate
miranda's
concerns
at
all.
i
think
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
really
arose
from
two
assumptions.
one
was
that
isolation
alone
is
sufficient
to
create
custody
in
all
circumstances.
and
that
can't
be
the
case,
because
we
know
that
an
inmate
can
be
told
that
he
can
leave,
he
can
be
given
an
initial
choice
before
he
comes
along
for
questioning,
he
can
be
interrogated
in
isolation
purely
because
he
is
waiting
to
be
treated
in
an
infirmary.
there
are
any
number
of
situations,
i
think,
where
an
inmate
could
be
isolated
for
questioning,
but
he
would
still
feel
free
to
leave.
going
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
whether
someone
in
prison
necessarily
feels
coerced,
i
think
that
the
court
in
shatzer
established
that
background
restrictions
incident
to
being
incarcerated
are
not
in
themselves
sufficient
to
create
miranda
custody.
so
in
other
words,
they
don't
create
such
a
huge
coercive
impact
that
nobody
would
feel
free
to
terminate
questioning.
so
i
think
accepting
the
proposition
that
someone
in
prison
is
always
coerced
would
lead
to
a
per
se
rule
that
says,
no
matter
how
non-accusatorial,
no
matter
how
non-coercive
that
situation
is,
that
person
would
always
be
in
custody.
so--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
in
either
situation,
you
have
to
look
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
and
so
we
know
that
restraints
alone
--
the
restraints
of
prison
aren't
enough
alone.
and
so
when
you
consider
the
restraints
--
when
you
consider
the
--
the
fact
that
a
prisoner
is
told
he
has
to
go
into
a
room,
you
would
look
not
only
to
that
fact,
but
you'd
also
look
to
everything
that
happens
in
the
questioning.
but
then
when
you
go
back
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
was
told
that
he
has
to
come
to
the
room,
you
would
--
you
would
look
to
whether
it's
a
normal
prison
policy
that
prisoners
always
have
to
be
escorted
places,
and
so
that
would
help
the
court
determine
whether--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
two
points.
one
is
that
--
the
fact
that
he
is
asked
to
--
the
fact
that
he
is
told
he
has
to
go
to
this
room
is
not
the
only
circumstance
of
the
interrogation.
so
certainly
what
happens
in
the
questioning
can
lead
a
reasonable
prisoner
to
believe
that
he
is
free
to
go,
even
though
he
has
been
told
he
has
to
go
to
the
questioning.
so
if
he
is
told
he
can
leave,
if
it
becomes
clear
from
experience,
if
there's
a
prison
policy
saying
that
inmates
can
always
leave,
if
he
sees
that
he
can
summon
the
guards.
all
of
those
circumstances
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
was
told
initially
that
he
has
to
go
with
the
guard.
and
the
second
thing--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--that's
right.
he
didn't
have
that
initial
choice.
but
once
he
got
into
the
questioning,
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
what
can
happen
where
the
inmate
here
was
told
that
he
could
end
the
questioning.
so
the
ultimate
question
for
miranda
custody
is
whether
the
reasonable
person
would
feel
free
to
terminate
the
interrogation.
and
so
in
considering
all
the
circumstances,
one
circumstance
would
be
that
the
inmate
was
told
he
has
to
come
to
the
questioning,
but
another
circumstance
would
be
that
he
was
then
told
once
he
got
there
that
he
could
end
the
questioning.
so
there
are
--
there
are
other
factors
like
that
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that
would
be
a
relevant
factor
here,
too,
as
would
the
fact
that
the
door
was
partially
open,
the
questioning
was
not
threatening,
there
were
only
two
officers--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--that's
correct.
that
--
that
is
a
--
that's
a
background
restraint
of
incarceration,
and
in
looking
at
whether
that
particular
restraint
made
the
inmate
feel
that
he
couldn't
terminate
the
questioning,
you
would
look
both
to
the
fact
that,
as
he
himself
said,
it's
common
sense
that
inmates
have
to
be
escorted
to
and
from
places
in
the
prison.
and
also--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
is
a
circumstance
within
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
here,
but
any
kind
of
effect
that
it
had
on
making
the
inmate
feel
that
he
couldn't
terminate
the
question
was
entirely
offset
by
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
he
could
leave
multiple
times.
