don't
you
think
being
in
custody
itself
is
a
circumstance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
all
this
"all-circumstances
mix?
"
"i
thought
that
our
case
law
was
fairly
clear
that
all
circumstances
is
a
test
for
voluntariness.
"
"i
thought
the
issue
has
always
been
under
miranda:
is
the
person
free
to
go
or
not?
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
since
when
have
we
imported
of
the
language
of
voluntariness
into
the
miranda
test?
should
we
be
creating
yet
another
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
go
to
the
test
of
freedom
to
leave.
justice

you're
taken
from
your
cell
and
locked
into
a
room
--
and
let's
change
the
facts--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
locked
in
a
room
and
said:
talk
to
me;
you
have
to
tell
me
what
happened.
is
that
person
free
to
go?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what
makes
this
case
different?
he's
taken
from
a
--
except
being
told
that
he
could
leave.
if
he
had
been
taken
from
his
cell,
removed
from
the
prison,
his
normal
setting,
taken
by
armed
guards
to
another
building,
and
with
guards
at
the
door,
sat
down
and
told:
talk
to
us
about
this
incident.
why
would
he
think
he
was
free
to
leave?
there
is
one
fact
i'm
taking
out
of
it,
which
is
that
he
was
told
he
was
free
to
go.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
i
see
the
record,
he
claims
twice
he
said:
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you.
and
when
he
asked
to
leave
at
the
end,
it
took
20
minutes,
and
they
continued
the
questioning.
doesn't
that
counter
the
rest
of
what
you
are
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
chief
asked
you
in
his
question
which
way
does
it
cut,
meaning
you
seem
to
be
advocating
a
rule
that
says
merely
because
he's
in
prison
is
irrelevant,
standing
alone.
i
think
your
adversary
is
saying
you
can't
take
out
the
fact
that
this
person's
liberty
is
restrained
from
the
equation.
so
going
back
to
my
hypothetical,
if
you
are
forced
to
leave
the
prison,
as
this
gentleman
was,
and
put
in
another
room,
what
presumption
should
you
start
with?
shouldn't
the
presumption
be
that
if
you
are
forced
to
go
to
another
place
that
you
are
in
custody?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
would
make
someone
who
is
forced
to
go
somewhere
think
that
they
are
free
to
go
back,
absent
being
told?
but
what
--
what
would
make
any
reasonable
prisoner
who
can't
move
without
an
escort
believe
that
they
are
always
free
to
go
back?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
once
they
are
forced
to
go
from
point
a
to
point
b.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
going
back
to
confusing
coercion
issues
with
custody
issues,
and
--
i
don't
know
that
you
have
really
answered
justice
breyer's
question.
someone's
picked
off
the
street
and
told,
you
have
to
go
into
this
room,
and
questions
are
asked.
wouldn't
we
assume
that
that
person
is
in
custody?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
he
didn't
choose
to
go
in
that
room.
he
was
placed
in
that
room.
what
makes
him
think
that
if
his
jailers
were
walking
him
somewhere,
that
he
was
free
to
leave?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
first
ohio
court
--
i'm
sorry,
the
court
below
--
had
its
own
--
seemingly
had
its
own
absolute
rule,
yet
--
that
if
you
are
told
you're
free
to
go,
that
that
breaks
the
chain
of
custody,
whatever
that
might
mean.
assuming
--
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
if
you
are
removed
from
the
prison
and
questioned,
you
--
you
absolutely
must
be
given
warnings.
is
there
a
middle
ground,
and
what
would
that
middle
ground
be?
and
what
--
how
would
that
middle
ground
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case?
