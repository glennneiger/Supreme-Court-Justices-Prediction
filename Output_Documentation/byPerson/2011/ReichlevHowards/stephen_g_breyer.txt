justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
never
held
that
in
respect
to
a
claim
that
the
real
reason
the
police
arrested
was
retaliation
against,
for
example,
a
picket
sign
having
an
unpopular
point
of
view
or
a
statement
having
an
unpopular
point
of
view.
that
is,
this
court
has
never
held
that
it
overcomes
an
arrest
where
there's
a
claim
of
retaliatory
first
amendment
action;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
what
you
are
saying
is
your
first
reason
is
that
we
should
say
that,
and
the
--
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
there
is,
you
make
a
very
strong
case
where
the
president
and
vice
president
are
involved,
the
need
to
protect
them,
but
the
rule
that
you
there
adopt
is
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
every
police
officer,
anyone
who
arrests
anyone
anywhere
in
the
country,
and
no
matter
how
clear
it
is
that
the
motive
was
retaliation
against
a
point
of
view,
that
individual
will
be
protected
from
a
bivens
action.
so
it
sounds
as
if
your
first
claim
--
the
remedy
sweeps
well
beyond
the
need
that
you
sketch.
and
so
i'd
like
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
saying
if
i
agree
with
you
on
your
first
that
if
there
is
a
probable
cause
for
an
arrest,
then
wouldn't
i
have
to
say
there
is
no
retaliatory
first
amendment
claim
when
a
border
officer
chases
into
arizona
a
person
with
whom
he
politically
disagrees,
and
there
are
14
bishops
who
will
say
he
cared
about
nothing
but
his
political
disagreement?
and
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary,
and
he
says:
oh,
i
happened
to
notice,
at
trial,
that
when
he
left
he
reached
out
and
snatched
a
five
dollar
bill
that
was
in
the
till
and
so
i
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
end
of
case.
now,
that
sounds
very
far-reaching
and
i
don't
know
that
i'm
prepared
to
do
that.
so
therefore,
is
there
another
way
you
might
win
your
case,
or
should
i
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
of
course,
hartman
dealt
with
prosecutions.
but
people
all
the
time
don't
arrest
others.
policemen
frequently
don't
arrest
people
for
everything
they
might
arrest
them
for.
i
mean
jaywalking,
to
take
an
example.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
where
they
just
normally
don't
arrest
somebody.
you
might
--
or
i'm
sure
you
didn't,
but
i
might
sometimes
have
driven
60
miles
an
hour
in
a
55-mile
zone.
and
i
shouldn't
even
admit
this.
i
hope
i
get
away
with
it.
[laughter]
but
--
but
--
but
you
see,
it's
different
arrests
and
prosecutions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
illegitimate
--
look,
you
just
used
the
word
"crowd
control".
i
take
it
in
saying
the
word
"crowd
control"
you
are
making
a
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
the
same
rule
of
automatic,
you
know,
immunity
--
it's
sort
of
automatic
immunity
--
when
crowd
control
isn't
at
issue,
where
there
is
a
history
of
persecution
of
an
individual
by
a
particular
officer,
da,
da,
da.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
can
make
up
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
want
it
absolutely
across
the
board,
or
are
you
going
to
start
making
distinctions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
about
the
crowd
control.
i
see
that.
i
see
that
problem.
i
see
the
problem
of
protecting
people
in
public
life;
i
see
the
problem
in
protecting
the
president.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
how
far--
now
given
that
that's
a
particular
problem
where
views
are
likely
to
be
evidentiary,
unpopular
views
actually
are,
unfortunately.
but
how
far
do
you
extend
it?
you
say
extend
it
to
everything.
to
jaywalking,
to
persecutions,
to,
you
know,
that's
what's
making
me
a
little
nervous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
--
how
many
cases
--
you
might
know
this;
you
might
have
information
on
how
many
cases
over
5
years
or
whatever
period
there
actually
have
been
against
federal
protective
officials
of
retaliatory
first
amendment
activity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
in
the
department,
wouldn't
it?
they'd
keep
track?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know
that
this
is
not
unique,
the
one
before
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
when
you
looked
up
your
research
for
this,
did
you
find
any
other
case
in
which
anyone
had
ever
asserted
a
first
amendment
claim
of
retaliation
for
arrest--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--against
a
federal
protective
official?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
--
and
also
you
left
out
that
one
of
the
agents
overheard
him
say
he
was
going
to
ask
the
vice
president
how
many
babies
he
killed
that
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
their
job
is
to
protect
the
vice
president.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
their
job.
and
it's
a
very
emotional
subject.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
something
happens
to
the
president,
nobody's
going
to
say,
oh,
you
know,
what
were
you
doing?
and
the
whole
country
is
in
mourning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
understand
that.
and
therefore
it's
a
matter
of
concern
that
if
you
have
a
rule
of
law
that
says
to
the
agents,
when
you
hear
someone
who
says,
how
many
babies
are
you
--
have
you
killed
that
day,
i'm
going
to
ask
the
vice
president,
i'm
going
to
touch
him,
i
am
going
to
then
tell
them
a
lie
when
they
ask
me
if
i
touched
him
--
that's
cause
for
concern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
if
there's
a
lawsuit,
the
agency
will
say
we
just
can't
do
it.
we
can't
do
it.
we
can't
use
that
as
a
basis
for
stopping
that
individual.
all
that
poses
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
--
i
think
--
i
recognize
that
it's
a
problem.
i'm
not
saying
i
have
the
solution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
the
case
of
the
president,
if
what
you
are
hearing,
as
you
well
know,
that
the
combination
of
disparate
political
views
and
risk
is
unlike
other
situations.
and
i
don't
know
if
they
can
prove
it
or
you
could
prove
the
contrary,
but
that's
--
that's
a
claim.
and
i
can't
say
there's
nothing
to
it.
so
let
me
suggest
to
you
another
arrow
which
--
and
ask
you
what
do
you
think
of
this
arrow
and
the
answer's
going
to
be
not
much,
but
i'm
interested
in
hearing
your
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
hartman,
justice
ginsburg
and
i
dissent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
we
referred
to
a
d.c.
circuit
case.
and
in
the
d.c.
circuit
it
said
--
it
talked
about
rare
cases
where
strong
motive
evidence
combined
with
weak
probable
cause
to
support
a
finding
that
the
prosecution
would
not
have
occurred
but
for
the
animus.
so
far
you
think,
fine.
but
suppose
you
were
to
say
because
of
the
factors
that
have
just
been
mentioned
where
the
president's
at
stake,
the
courts
--
where
his
life
is
at
stake,
the
president's
--
the
courts
will
not
infer
once
probable
cause
exists
that
it's
weak.
and
the
courts
will
not
infer
from
the
simple
presence
of
political
disagreement
that
the
motive
or
retaliation
is
strong,
which
in
fact
would
produce
a
very
limited
extension
of
hartman
to
the
case
of
protecting
the
president
of
the
united
states.
and
now
i
know
you
are
not
going
to
agree
with
that,
and
i'm
trying
it
out
and
i'm
not
saying
that
i
agree
with
it,
but
i
want
to
see
how
you
react.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
then
putting
it
in
their
point
of
view,
i
just
what
he
actually
said.
he
was
very
angry,
your
client.
i
mean,
judging
what
he
said,
there
were
a
lot
of
swear
words
and
so
forth,
he
was
pretty
angry
at
this
whole
situation.
so
you
are
a
secret
service
agent,
and
you
hear
him
say
--
speak
like
this,
he
has
every
right
to
speak
like
that,
i
mean
people
do,
i
understand
that
--
but
now
he's
also
thinking
that
--
that
i'm
nervous
about
this.
the
--
the
president
is
here,
the
vice
president,
whatever--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
same
thing,
and
--
and
i've
got
to
do
my
job.
so
--
so
--
and
nobody's
going
to
say,
oh,
oh,
whatever
it
is,
first,
whatever
if
is,
if
somebody
is
hurt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
also
lied
about
whether
he
touched
the
president.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
has
also
been
talking
about
the
president
killing
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--killing
babies
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
is
he
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
isn't
this
situation
--
but
this
situation,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--nothing
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
says,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
lot
of
people
in
that
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
lied.
