chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-262,
reichle
v.
howards.
mr.
gallagher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume
you
would
include
u.s.
marshals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
f.b.i.
agents?
so
you
are
talking
about
protective
details.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lane.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
you've
described
is
not
when
the
person
was
arrested,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
was
arrested
later,
when
approached
by
the
secret
service
agent,
lied
about
whether
he
touched
the
vice
president;
at
that
time,
in
a
non-protected
area,
was
carrying
a
bag,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
wandering
around.
turns
out
that
he
was
looking
for
his
son.
but
if
you're
the
secret
service
agent,
you
see
somebody
who
said
your
policies
are
disgusting,
that
person
touches
the
vice
president,
he
comes
--
he
lies
to
you.
he
comes
back,
he's
carrying
a
bag
and
he's
wondering
--
wandering
around,
do
you
think
it's
reasonable
at
that
--
well,
i
guess
you
don't--
[laughter]
to
arrest
the
person?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
reason
it's
multi-faceted
is
because
i'm
trying
to
capture
what
might
have
been
going
through
the
secret
service
agent's
mind
at
the
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
was
going
in
a
reasonable
secret
service's
agent's
mind
at
the
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
you
have
under
your
theory,
a
person
should
put
on
his
car
a
bumper
sticker
that
says
"i
hate
the
police"
and
every
time
they
are
pulled
over
they
will
have
certainly
a
plausible
case
is
you
violated
my
first
amendment
rights.
it's
not
because
i
was
going
60
miles
an
hour,
it's
because
of
my
bumper
sticker.
and
the
police
officer
at
that
point
says,
you
know,
i
can't
give
a
ticket
to
this
guy
without
being
hauled
into
court
on
personal
liability
because
he's
got
a
credible
case
that
was
for
first
amendment
grounds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
you
already
got
the
officer
in
court.
i
mean
you
get
a
speeding
ticket
and
most
times
they
don't
show
up
because
they
have
got
other
things
to
do.
now
he's
got
to
show
up
in
district
court,
in
state
court
to
defend
against
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
case
that
you
could
state.
he
pulled
me
over,
he
gave
me
a
speeding
ticket,
but
the
only
reason
he
picked
me
out
is
because
i
had
a
bumper
sticker
saying
"i
hate
the
police".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't
it
go
to
trial?
i
mean,
what,
does
it
go
--
do
you
have
to
depose
the
police
officer,
why
did
you
stop
him?
did
you
stop
anybody
else
for
going
65
miles
per
hour
that
day?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
only
way
you
could
find
out
is
you
put
in
the
evidence,
here's
the
bumper
sticker
and
you
put
the
police
officer
on
the
stand
and
you
say
why
did
you
do
it.
and
all
of
a
sudden,
i
don't
know
why
everybody
doesn't
have
a
bumper
sticker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
didn't
arrest
him
until
after
he
lied,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
summary
judgment,
that's
--
you're
already
been
in
court
a
long
time
when
you
are
talking
about
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
an
easy
way
out
of
it.
we
could
agree
with
the--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing
about
your
analysis
that
concerns
me
is
that
you
seem
to
have
a
very
black
and
white
view
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
officer's
mind:
did
you
stop
--
did
you
arrest
him
because
of
retaliation
or
was
it
legitimate
security?
and
i
suspect
that
the
people
engaged
in
this
type
of
thing
have
intuition.
i
mean,
they
don't
sit
there
and
say,
well,
let's
see;
is
it
because
he
says
he
didn't
like
the
war
in
iraq,
or
is
because
he
is
wandering
around,
looks
like
he
is
looking
for
something
with
a
--
with
a
bag?
i
mean
i
assume
they
sort
have
experience
and
they
calculate
all
this
in
and
say
i've
got
to
do
something.
and
how
do
you
parse
those
different
motivations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
reason
that
i
in
fact
don't
like
the
answer
is
be
--
because
what
the
agent
is
now
going
to
have
to
factor,
in
addition
to
the
hostility
of
the
--
the
views,
the
touching
of
the
vice
president,
the
lying
about
it,
the
wandering
around
with
the
bag
--
is
in
the
back
of
his
mind
--
you
know,
if
i'm
wrong,
i
may
be
held
personally
liable
in
damages
for
taking
some
action
that
some
jury
somewhere
is
going
to
say
is
based
on
retaliation
rather
than
my
obligation
to
protect
the
vice
president.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-262,
reichle
versus
howards.
