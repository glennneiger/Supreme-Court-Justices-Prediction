justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
noise
in
the
courtroom
and
i
am
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
hearing
your
very
opening
statement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
your
rule
apply
regardless
of
the
degree
of
animus
that
the
agent
is
alleged
to
have
had
as
to
the
particular
view
being
expressed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
might
apply
the
same
immunity
for
selective
enforcement
based
on
race?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
aware
of
the
reservation
in
whren.
why
should
there
be
a
difference
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
and
first
amendment
speech?
