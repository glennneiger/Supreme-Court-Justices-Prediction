justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
whether
two
secret
service
agents
are
immune
from
suit
for
allegedly
arresting
a
suspect
in
retaliation
for
his
speech
when
the
agents
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
suspect
for
committing
a
crime.
secret
service
agents,
gus
reichle
and
dan
doyle
were
part
of
vice
president
cheney's
protective
detail
when
he
visited
a
colorado
shopping
mall
in
2006.
while
the
vice
president
greeted
members
of
the
public,
agent
doyle
overheard
steven
howards
say
into
his
cellphone
that
he
was
going
to
ask
the
vice
president,
“how
many
kids
he
had
killed
that
day?”
howards
then
approached
the
vice
president
and
told
him
that
his
policies
in
iraq
were
disgusting.
as
the
vice
president
turned
to
leave,
howards
touched
his
shoulder.
howards
later
claimed
that
the
touch
was
merely
a
friendly
pat.
several
--
secret
service
agents
described
it
as
a
hostile
push.
after
this
encounter,
agent
reichle
attempted
to
question
howards
about
his
behavior.
howards
told
reichle
to
keep
the
vice
president
out
of
public
places
if
reichle
did
not
want
people
to
share
their
opinions.
howards
also
falsely
denied
having
touched
the
vice
president.
reichle
arrested
howards
who
was
charged
with
harassment.
that
charged
was
later
dropped.
howards
subsequently
brought
this
suit
against
reichle
and
doyle.
howards
claimed
that
his
arrest
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
agents
lacked
probable
cause.
howards
also
claimed
that
his
arrest
violated
the
first
amendment
because
it
was
retaliation
for
his
criticism
of
the
vice
president.
the
agents
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
they
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
but
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
on
appeal,
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
agents
enjoyed
immunity
from
howards'
fourth
amendment
claim
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
howards
for
lying
to
a
federal
officer.
as
to
howards'
first
amendment
claim,
however,
the
court
held
that
agents
were
not
immune
because
tenth
circuit
precedent
clearly
held
that
a
retaliatory
arrest
may
violate
the
first
amendment,
even
if
the
arrest
is
supported
by
probable
cause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
tenth
circuit's
judgment
denying
the
agents'
immunity
from
howards'
first
amendment
claim.
qualified
immunity
shields
government
officials
from
civil
damage
--
damages
liability
unless
the
officials
violated
a
constitutional
right
that
has
been
clearly
established.
this
court
has
--
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
a
retaliatory
arrest
that
is
independently
supported
by
probable
cause.
the
tenth
circuit
concluded
that
its
own
cases
had
clearly
established
such
a
right,
but
when
howards
was
arrested
the
continued
viability
of
the
tenth
circuit
precedent
was
not
clear
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
hartman
versus
moore.
hartman
held
that
the
existence
of
probable
cause
defeats
a
first
amendment
claim
of
retaliatory
prosecution
and
reasonable
officers
could
have
concluded
that
howards'
--
hartman's
rule
applied
equally
to
retaliatory
arrest.
first,
many
of
the
conflicting
court
of
appeals
or
courts
of
appeals'
decisions
that
prompted
our
review
in
hartman
involved
both
retaliatory
arrest
and
prosecution
claims
and
made
no
distinction
between
the
two
when
considering
the
relevance
of
probable
cause.
second,
several
features
of
retaliatory
prosecution
claims
that
are
central
to
harman's
rationale
are
present
in
retaliatory
arrest
cases
as
well.
finally,
various
courts
of
appeals
have
concluded
that
hartman's
no
probable
cause
requirement
extends
to
retaliatory
arrest
claims.
in
light
of
the
foregoing,
we
cannot
conclude
that
howards
has
a
--
had
a
clearly
established
first
amendment
right
to
be
free
of
a
retaliatory
arrest
that
was
otherwise
supported
by
probable
cause.
thus,
agents
reichle
and
doyle
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
