mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
off
addressing
the
secret
service
in
particular
because
that's
the
principal
focus,
although
i
take
the
point
that
there
are
questions
about
applying
the
rule
in
a
broader
context.
but
i
think
understanding
why
the
rule
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
secret
service
agents
and
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
performing
similar
protective
functions
would
help
inform
why
it
makes
sense
to
broaden
the
rule
as
well.
what
the
secret
service--
i
will
pick
up
on
the
point
that
petitioner's
counsel
was
making,
which
is
that
it's
legitimate
in
this
context
for
secret
service
agents
to
take
into
account
expressive
activity
in
determining
whether
the
circumstances
warrant
a
discretionary
exercise
of
the
power
to
arrest.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct.
and
that's
why
i
wouldn't
limit
it
to
the
secret
service
in
particular.
i
think
what
happens
in
a
lot
of
these
contexts
is
that
it's
natural
for
these
individuals
to
encounter
first
amendment
activity
by
the
public,
and
it's
legitimate
for
them
to
react
to
first
amendment
activity
in
deciding
whether
the
circumstances
warrant
an
arrest.
and
the
problem
arises
because
it's
very
difficult
to
distinguish
between
on
one
hand
a
legitimate
consideration
of
expressive
activity
as
evidencing
the
sort
of
threat
that
warrants
a
response
from
an
illegitimate
consideration
of
expressive
activity
borne
of
a
motive
to
suppress
it--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
it
would,
justice
kennedy,
because
we
would
have
an
across-the-board,
no-probable-cause
requirement
of
the
kind
that
the
court
applied
in
the
retaliatory
prosecution
context
in
hartman.
now,
i
think
your
--
the
question
of
the
degree
of
animus
asserted
by
the
agent
on
the
scene
is
exactly
why
these
are
complicated
factual
questions.
those
kinds
of
allegations
can
be
made,
and
then
you
are
going
to
have
a
trial
where
the
agent
is
on
the
stand,
and
the
jury
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time,
and
the
agent
is
going
to
have
a
difficult
time
explaining
why
it
is
that
he
acted
legitimately
based
on
expressive
activity
because
he
felt
that
there
was
a
threat
to
the
person
he
was
trying
to
protect,
as
opposed
to
explaining
that
he
didn't
act
in
order
to
suppress
the
viewpoint
that
was
being
asserted.
these
kinds
of
allegations
can
often
be
made.
and
in
fact
they
can
even
be
manufactured
at
the
scene
by
an
intelligent
person
who
is
going
to
be
the
subject
of
an
arrest.
and
i
think
that
complicated
question
of
causation
is
exactly
why
it
makes
sense
to
apply
in
this
context
the
same
objective
screening
in
the
form
of
a
no-probable-cause
requirement
in
hartman
to
this
context
of
retaliatory
arrest.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
point.
once
we
understand
why
it
is
that
it
makes
sense
to
apply
this
rule
in
the
context
of
officers
who
engage
in
this
sort
of
critical
public
--
protective
function
of
the
secret
service,
i
think
we
understand
why
it
also
makes
sense
to
apply
it
in
other
situations,
because
law
enforcement
can
legitimately
take
into
account
expressive
activity
when
they
are
engaged
in
functions
such
as
crowd
control.
and
in
those
contexts
as
well,
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
disaggregate
the
legitimate
consideration
of
expressive
activity
as
evidencing
a
threat
from
an
illegitimate
desire
to
suppress
a
viewpoint.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
--
i
would
not
draw
a
distinction,
justice
breyer.
of
course,
there's
going
to
be
factual
situations--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right,
and
i
can
understand
the
basis
for
the
nervousness.
i
guess
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
the
benefits
of
having
an
administrable
across-the-board
rule
outweigh
the
costs
of
trying
to
forge
some
sort
exceptions
to
deal
with
extreme
hypotheticals.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
we
do.
we
have
done
an
unscientific
search,
but
to
use
the
same
time
frame
of
reference
that
the
court
used
in
hartman,
which
is
looking
back
25
years,
if
you
look
a
do
a
sort
of
standard
lex
law
search,
what
you'll
see
is
there
is
roughly
100
court
of
appeals
cases
and
450
or
so
district
court
cases.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
know.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i'm
sure
there
are
scores
and
scores
of
arrests.
that's
correct.
and,
of
course,
all
we
are
talking
about
is
the
cases
that
get
to
the
point
where
you
have
an
opinion
that
can
be,
that
can
be
found.
and
there
is
the
obvious
point
that
depending
on
what
the
court
does
here,
you
may
see
a
proliferation
of
those
claims.
and
we
certainly
hope
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
but
i
think
--
on
the
question
of
whether
it
makes
sense
to
have
an
across-the-board
rule,
i
guess
i
would
echo
what
petitioners'
counsel
was
suggesting,
which
is,
you
can
have
the
same
set
of
considerations
in
the
retaliatory
prosecution
context
because
prosecutors
do
act
with,
by
hypothesis,
with
illicit
motives
in
some
situations.
and
the
court
considered
whether
the
benefits
of
having
an
across-the-board
rule
outweigh
the
costs
of
forging
an
exception
to
deal
with
extreme
circumstances.
and
what
the
court
said
was:
we
want
to
have
a
rule
that
is
designed
to
deal
with
a
mine
run
of
cases;
we
don't
want
to
have
a
rule
that
has
an
exceptional-circumstances
exception
because
in
that
--
at
that
point
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
litigation
concerning
what
cases
fit
within
of
the
exception
and
what
cases
don't.
and
what
the
court
said
was
that's
rather
like
designing
a
retirement
plan
to
deal
with
the
possibility
that
someone
might
win
the
lottery.
that's
in
footnote
10
of
hartman.
and
i
think
similar
considerations
would
weigh
--
counsel
in
favor
of
applying
an
across-the-board
objective,
no-probable-cause
screening
in
this
context
as
well.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
--
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
this
case
is
of
a
piece
with
hartman
in
two
relevant
respects.
your
honor
is
quite
correct
that
justice
souter's
opinion
focused
on
the
fact
that
you
have
two
individuals
in
play.
you
can
have
that
situation
here
but
we
don't
base
it
on
that.
what
the
opinion
was
getting
to
was
that
that
creates
complex
issues
of
causation
in
the
prosecution
context.
and
i
think
it
was
the
complex
causation
that
really
drove
the
need
to
have
an
objective
across-the-board
rule.
you
have
the
same
kind
of
complex
causation
problem
here,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
explained,
which
is
that
it's
extremely
difficult
to
disentangle
a
legitimate
desire
to
act
to
get
--
to
suppress
danger,
of
which
speech
is
evidence,
from
an
illegitimate
desire
to
suppress
a
viewpoint.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
same
immunity?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
the
--
they
--
i
think
the
court's
decision
in
whren,
for
example,
supposed
that
even
though
you
have
probable
cause,
you
can
have
an
equal
protection
claim
if
the
proof
could
be
made
--
and
this
is
very
important.
in
the
equal
protection
context,
including
for
race,
there
is
a
different
objective
screen
in
place
and
it's
a
stringent
objective
screen
that
this
court
announced
in
armstrong,
which
is
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
part
--
part
of
the
reason
is
this,
that
with
the
first
amendment
expressive
activity
can
legitimately
be
taken
into
account,
precisely
because
it
can
manifest
a
danger,
whereas
with
race
in
the
ordinary
case
i
think
the
reason
why
we
have
these
principles
in
the
race
context
is
it's
ordinarily
not
a
relevant
consideration.
and
the
armstrong
rule
is
designed
to
distinguish
between
circumstances
in
race
--
in
which
race
was
the
motivation
and
in
which
race
wasn't
the
motivation.
and
it
serves
that
purpose
well.
but
it
doesn't
work
so
well
in
this
context,
because
here
first
amendment
activity
can
legitimately
be
taken
into
account.
when,
as
in
this
case,
a
secret
service
agent
overhears
an
individual
say
that
he's
going
to
ask
the
vice
president
how
many
babies
he's
killed,
it
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
for
the
secret
service
to
focus
their
attention
on
that
person.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
it's
the
--
the
nature,
intensity
and
vehemence
with
which
the
first
amendment
activity
is
being
engaged
in
can
inform
an
officer
on
whether
the
circumstances
present
the
kind
of
danger
that
warrants
a
law
enforcement
response.
so
that
a
--
and
--
and
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
does
that,
he's
going
to
be
subject
to
potential
liability
if
an
individual
says:
look,
you
weren't
reacting
against
me
because
of
the
way
i
was
expressing
my
views;
you
were
acting
--
reacting
against
me
because
you
disagreed
with
my
views
and
you
wanted
to
suppress
them.
and
that's
a
very
hard
thing
to
disentangle.
and
it
not
only
has
that
problem
at
the
back
end,
but
it
results
in
the
problem
at
the
front
end
as
well,
because
what
happens
at
the
front
end
is
that
officers
at
the
very
outer
margins
might
have
in
the
back
of
their
mind
a
concern
that
if
they
acted
based
on
their
best
intuitions
about
what
kind
of
law
enforcement
response
is
warranted,
they
might
be
later
be
subject
to
suit
based
on
a
mistaken
assumption
and
potentially
an
ability
to
convince
a
jury
that
they
were
acting
based
on
an
illegitimate
desire
to
suppress
a
viewpoint
rather
than
on
a
legitimate
desire--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's
potentially
there,
but
i
--
i
just
don't
have
the
answer
at
my
disposal,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
these
--
certainly,
we
know
that
these
kinds
of
interactions
arise
with
some
frequency.
i
think
there
was
some
publicity
surrounding
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--in--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--candidly,
i
didn't
--
we
didn't
conduct
a
search
with
that
object
in
mind.
so
i
--
i
can't
give
you
an
answer
one
way
--
one
way
or
the
other.
i
did
want
to
make
one
additional
point,
justice
ginsburg,
in
response
to
the
question
you
posed
about
the
applicability
of
hartman,
which
is
that
at
one
level
it
applies,
the
rule
should
apply,
because
the
same
concern
with
complex
causation
is
at
issue
here
at
well
--
as
well.
but
the
other
way
to
think
about
the
applicability
of
hartman
is
to
--
is
to
put
these
cases
on
a
spectrum.
on
one
end,
you
have
what
the
court
in
hartman
identified
as
a
standard
retaliation
case,
of
which
the
court
identified
public
employment
as
the
archetypal
example.
and
on
the
other
end,
you
have
retaliatory
prosecution,
where
the
courts
thought
that
there
were
sufficient
concerns
about
complicated
causation
that
it
made
sense
to
have
an
across-the-board
objective
rule.
now,
the
question
could
be
where
does
retaliatory
arrest
fit
within
that
spectrum?
is
it
on
the
retaliatory
prosecution
side
or
is
it
on
the
public
employment
side?
and
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
i
think
it
fits
decidedly
within
the
retaliatory
prosecution
side.
one
is
the
one
i've
given,
which
is
that
speech
can
legitimately
be
taken
into
account
and
so
it
creates
complex
causation.
but
the
other
one
is
in
some
sense
the
flip
side
of
that,
which
is
that
in
--
in
the
public
employment
context,
the
standard
fact
pattern
is
going
to
involve
a
long-term
relationship
between
an
employer
and
an
employee,
during
which
time
there's
been
no
adverse
action,
the
employee
then
engages
in
some
sort
of
expressive
activity,
in
the
aftermath
of
which
the
employer
undertakes
some
adverse
action
such
as
a
termination.
now,
in
that
context
it
makes
sense
to
infer
that
there
may
well
be
an
illegitimate
speech
--
speech-suppressive
motivation
at
work,
because
you
have
in
some
sense
a
control
period
in
the
interactions
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
that
predated
the
expressive
activity.
that's
not
the
case
when
we're
dealing
with
law
enforcement.
in
the
law
enforcement
context
in
the
main,
this
is
a
one-time
interaction
between
an
officer
and
a
suspect,
the
arrestee.
you
don't
have
the
prior
relationship
that
acts
as
a
control.
and
so
you
have
to
ask
the
question
whether,
based
on
that
one-time
relationship,
is
there
a
basis
for
inferring
that
a
speech-suppressing
motivation
was
at
work.
and
here,
because
it
can
be
legitimate
for
an
officer
to
take
into
account
speech
in
deciding
whether
this
situation
was
the
kind
of
one
in
which
a
law
enforcement
response
is
warranted,
it
makes
sense,
unlike
in
the
public
employment
context,
to
apply
the
same
objective
across-the-board
screening
in
the
form
of
a
no-probable-cause
requirement
that
we
have
in
prosecutions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
was
not,
your
honor.
of
course,
that's
exactly
what
happens
in
the
fourth
amendment
context.
that's
--
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court
in
devenpeck.
and
the
court
explained
in
devenpeck
why
it
makes
sense
to
have
an
objective
probable
cause
inquiry
rather
than
a
subjective
one--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
know
the
reason
that
a
--
i
don't
know
the
--
the
precise
contours
of
the
harassment
charges
in
state
court
that
were
made.
i
think
that
they
mapped
on
in
some
measure
to
the
assault,
the
assault
that
was
suspected
by
the
--
by
officer
reichle,
who
effected
the
arrest.
i
think
the
concern
with
importing
some
sort
of
subjective
probable
cause
dimension
into
the
inquiry
--
if
you
asked,
you
know,
what
offense
did
the
officer
in
fact
have
in
mind,
it's
the
same
concerns
that
drove
the
court
to
apply
an
objective
rule
in
devenpeck,
including,
for
example,
that
you
would
have
dis-uniformity,
in
that
similarly
situated
individuals
would
be
treated
differently
based
purely
on
what
happens
to
have
been
in
an
officer's
mind.
thank
you.
