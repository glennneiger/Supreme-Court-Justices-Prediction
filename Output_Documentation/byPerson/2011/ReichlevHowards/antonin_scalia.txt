justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
have
to
give
--
at
least
when
you
stop
a
car,
the
test
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
not
whether
that
was
the
reason
that
the
officer
stopped
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
broken
tail
light,
there
existed
probably
cause,
whether
that
was
the
basis
on
which
he
acted
or
not.
now
--
is
it
any
different
when--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
respect
to
an
arrest?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
they
have
good
reason
for
an
arrest,
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
different?
you
--
you
acknowledge
that
prosecutors
always
prosecute,
that
they
never
exercise
discretion
and
say,
oh,
what
the
heck,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
time,
all
the
time.
i
don't
know
that
it's
any
less
frequent
than
--
than
an
officer
deciding
not
to
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
there
any
difference
if
--
when
ordinary
policemen
are
policing
an
authorized
demonstration--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
front
of
this
court
or
anywhere
for
that
matter?
the
people
making
the
demonstration
have
--
have
the
same
motivation
and
can
make
the
same
assertion
of:
oh,
the
only
reason
you
arrested
me
was
because
you
didn't
like
what
i
was
talking
about.
so
why
should
that
situation
be
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
for
crowd
control?
you
want
to
extend
it
to
crowd
control
as
well.
what
difference
does
the
first
amendment
make
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
assault,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
it
takes
for
an
assault
is
--
is
an
unwanted
touching.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
incidental.
if
you
reach
out
and
touch
somebody
on
the
shoulder
or
the
arm.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine
and
he
doubtless
didn't
consider
those
contacts
hostile.
but
when
somebody
tells
you
"i
think
your
policies
are
disgusting--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
just
don't
tell
me
that
it's
--
it's
not
a
crime.
it
--
it
is
an
assault
if
it's
an
unwanted
touching.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
if
they
only
did
that
because
they
didn't
like
the
ideas
he
was
expressing?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
they're
doing
it
for
--
they
do
it
for
a
racial
reason,
would
that
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
i
don't
see
how
your
first
amendment
exception
doesn't
apply
to
those
things
for
the
arrest--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
a
conclusion.
i
mean,
if
--
if
he
didn't
have
the
bumper
sticker
and
you
asserted
in
the
pleading
he
stopped
me
because
he
knows
i
hate
the
police,
that's
a
conclusion.
but
if
you
have
the
bumper
sticker,
he
says,
you
know,
i
had
the
bumper
sticker,
and
that's
why
he
stopped
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
--
why
you
say
that
they
are
immune
from
the
charge
of
first
amendment
retaliation
for
that,
but
not
immune
from
the
charge
of
first
amendment
--
i
mean
if
you
say
they
are
doing
it
on
first
amendment
grounds
for
the
one,
they
are
doing
it
on
the
first
amendment
grounds
for
the
other.
why
is
either
one
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we've
lost
a
couple
of
presidents.
[laughter]
