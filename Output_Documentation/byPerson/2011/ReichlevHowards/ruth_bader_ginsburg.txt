well,
what
was
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
the
probable
cause?
what
was
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
that
to
me.
that's
a
false
statement
to
a
government
officer.
but
that's
not
the
reason
--
1001
wasn't
the
reason
that
these
officers
had
to
arrest.
there
was
a
question
of
assaulting
the
vice
president,
and
i
think
that
the
charge
that
eventually
was
made
in
the
state
court
was
harassment.
so,
there
is
no
indication
that
these
officers
had
1001
anywhere
in
their
minds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
not
suggesting
absolute
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
a
different
kind
of
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
--
i
think
in
hartman,
justice
souter
gave
two
specific
reasons,
neither
of
which
apply
in
this
context.
if
the
prosecutor
institutes
the
charges,
but
the
suit
is
not
against
the
prosecutor,
he
would
be
absolutely
immune.
so
that
is
not
in
this
picture.
here
we
have
one
officer.
so
it
would
certainly
be
an
extension
of
hartman
because
the
reason
that
hartman
gave
for
the
rule
was
tied
to
--
very
much
tied
to
prosecution
rather
than
arrest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
to
the
probable
cause,
the
question
i
asked
before.
it's
not
like
the
taillight.
1001
came
up
in
court.
this
--
this
situation
may
well
have
warranted
probable
cause
for
assault,
probable
cause
for
harassment.
but
where
did
--
the
1001
was
not
the
--
was
in
no
one's
mind.
it
does
seem
quite
strange.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
it
matter
that
it's
something
that
comes
up
only
in
court;
it's
not
something
that
--
why
--
why
wasn't
the
natural
one
would
expect
probable
cause
to
arrest
because
it
was
an
assault
or
harassment,
the
actual
charges
that
were
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
ambivalent.
suppose
it
turns
out
you
have
this
trial,
we
know
what
words
were
spoken.
get
to
the
trial,
it
turns
out
reichle
is
a
strong
opponent
of
the
war
in
vietnam.
then,
end
of
trial,
right?
