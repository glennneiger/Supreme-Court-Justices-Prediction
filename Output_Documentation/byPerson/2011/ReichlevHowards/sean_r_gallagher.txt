mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
secret
service
agents
who
are
prepared
to
take
a
bullet
for
the
vice
president
must
also
be
prepared
to
take
a
retaliatory
arrest
lawsuit,
even
when
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest.
respondent
in
this
case
seeks
personal
money
damages
against
two
u.s.
secret
service
agents
who
arrested
him,
allegedly
with
a
retaliatory
motive,
after
he
lied
to
them
about
whether
he
touched
vice
president
cheney.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
sure.
the
respondent
in
this
case
seeks
personal
money
damages
against
three
--
against
two
u.s.
secret
service
agents
who
arrested
him,
allegedly
with
a
retaliatory
motive,
after
he
lied
to
them
about
whether
he
touched
vice
president
cheney.
there
are
three
reasons
why
these
agents
should
not
be
held
personally
liable.
first,
the
absence
of
probable
cause
should
be
a
required
element
of
a
retaliatory
arrest
claim.
thus
this
court
is
called
upon
to
answer
the
question
that
it
left
open
in
hartman
against
moore.
second,
u.s.
secret
service
agents
acting
in
their
protective
capacity
should
be
entitled
to
a
qualified
immunity
when
they
make
an
arrest
with
probable
cause.
indeed,
to
view
it
any
other
way
would
be
to
subject
secret
service
agents
to
the
potential
of
retaliatory
arrest
claims
based
upon
a
mere
allegation
of
retaliatory
animus,
something
this
court
has
steadfastly
refused
to
do,
and
for
good
reason:
because
retaliatory
animus
is
easy
to
allege
and
hard
to
disprove.
and
third,
regardless
of
whether
this
court
decides
to
extend
the
hartman
rule,
the
law
in
2006,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
was
not
clearly
established,
thus
entitling
the
agents
to
qualified
immunity.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
justice
ginsburg,
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
the
probable
cause
that
underlied
this
opinion
was
a
1001
--
a
1001
violation,
lying
to
a
federal
agent.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
well,
two
points,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
under
devenpeck
officers
are
not
required
to
give
all
of
the
reasons
behind
an
arrest.
but
second,
and
i
think
perhaps
more
importantly
in
this
case,
when
agent
reichle
contacted
mr.
howards
and
made
the
arrest,
mr.
howards
had
lied
to
him.
that
was
relevant
to
a
secret
service
agent's
assessment
of
the
risk
of
the
situation.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
i
don't
think
it
is--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--yes,
with
respect
to
an
arrest.
this
is
--
this
is--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--absolutely.
that's
an
objective--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--that's
right.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
--
the
determination
in
the
--
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
to
extend
devenpeck
to
these
facts
was
not
the
subject
of
a
cross-appeal.
so
the
issue
that
you
--
you
posit
is
not
an
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
well,
let
me
answer
--
answer
both
of
those
questions.
what
you
have
outlined
is
essentially
footnote
10
from
the
hartman
case.
that's
the
footnote
that
says:
what
do
you
do
if
the
--
if
the
person
that
initiated
the
prosecution
says,
i
did
it
for
a
--
a
retaliatory
reason?
and
the
court
side-stepped
that
issue.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
yes.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
well,
i
--
certainly,
it's
different,
but
the
devenpeck
standard--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
and
justice
--
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
difficulty
with
your
--
your
hypothetical
is,
especially
with
regards
to
secret
service
agents,
who
perform,
when
they
are
engaging
in
their
protective
functions,
they're
essentially--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--sure.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
okay.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
let
me
--
let
me
briefly
address
the
first
half
of
the
question
and
then
i
will
address
the
second
half.
the
first
half,
when
--
when,
justice
sotomayor,
when
you
suggest
that
police
officers
could
trample
on
the
first
amendment,
it's
important
to
remember
we
still
have
probable
cause
as
the
--
as
the
principal--
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
--but
probable
cause
is
the
fourth
amendment
standard
specified
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
exactly
the
case.
again
it
gets
back
to
this
footnote
10
in
hartman,
which
--
which,
there
--
hartman
can
be
read
two
different
ways.
it
can
be
read
as
--
as
saying
that
the
elements
of
the
constitutional
tort
itself
require
the
absence
of
probable
cause,
or
it
can
be
read
as
saying
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
but
let
me
--
let
me
address
the
second
question.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
yes.
and
the
second
question
had
to
do
with
secret
service
agents,
because
secret
service
agents,
unlike
police
officers
providing
law
enforcement
functions,
when
secret
service
are
acting
in
a
protective
capacity,
they
are
protecting
our
nation's
leaders
and
they
are
doing
so
in
a
very
public
way,
and
they
are
also
doing
so
in
a
way
that
is
essentially
a
free
speech
zone.
virtually
everyone
that
a
secret
service
agent
encounters
when
he
is
protecting
the
president
or
the
vice
president
can
allege
that
they
are
engaged
in
free
speech.
so
for
secret
service
agents
in
particular,
they
--
they
can
legitimately
evaluate
what
someone
is
saying
in
order
to
determine
a
particular
threat
level.
and
because
of
that,
secret
service
agents
have
a
similar
sort
of
complexity
of
causation
to
the
--
the
--
the
situation
addressed
in
the
hartman
case.
now,
in
hartman
clearly
it
was
a
one
--
it
was
a
--
a
two-individual
causation
situation,
but
--
but
with
--
with
regard
to
secret
service
agents,
the
causation
is
similarly
complex,
because
secret
service
agents
can
legitimately
take
into
account
what
someone
is
saying
in
order
to
determine
a
threat
level.
regardless
of
whether
the
court
decides
to
extend
the
hartman
case,
it's
--
it's
absolutely
clear
that
the
law
in
2006,
in
june
of
2006
when
the
agents
made
this
arrest,
was
not
clearly
established.
the
hartman
case
was
handed
down
in
early
2006.
it
had
only
been
on
the
books
about
3
months
when
the
arrest
was
made.
for
that
reason,
secret
service
agents
should
be
entitled
to
a
qualified
immunity
in
this
case
because
the
law
was
not
clearly
established.
with
regard
to
the
--
the
--
the
formulation
of
qualified
immunity
that
we
are
asking
for,
we
believe
that
it
is
important
for
secret
service
agents
acting
in
this
protective
capacity
to
have
the
requisite
breathing
room
in
order
to
make
decisions
in
life-or-death
or
imminent-threat
situations.
in
fact,
the
qualified
immunity
that
we
are
advocating
is
particularly
important
at
the
margins,
particularly
important
in
situations
where
it's
not
clear
what
a
secret
service
agent
can
do
or
should
do,
where
a
secret
service
agent
has
to
make
a
snap
decision
in
order
to
determine
whether
someone's
a
threat
and
then
act
appropriately.
the
court
in
the
atwater
case
noted
that
the
object
of
--
of
the
court's
cases
has
been
to
draw
standards
sufficiently
clear
and
simple
to
be
applied
with
the
fair
prospect
of
surviving
judicial
second-guessing
months
and
even
years
after
the
--
the
arrests
are
made.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
no,
we
are
suggesting
a
qualified
immunity.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
it's
certainly
different
from
the
harlow
type
of
qualified
immunity.
it
is
an
immunity
that
is
contingent
upon
having
--
contingent
upon
the
secret
service
agent
being
--
acting
in
a
protective
capacity
and
having
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest.
but
certainly,
once
the
immunity
attaches,
it
would
be,
it
would
be
full
immunity
from
a
claim.
the
court
noted
earlier
this
term
in
ridner
v.
hub
case,
that
judges
should
be
cautious
about
second-guessing
a
police
officer's
assessment
made
on
the
scene
of
the
danger
presented
by
a
particular
situation.
we
think
that
this
case
aptly
demonstrates
the
situation
in
which
secret
service
agents
made
very
--
very
difficult
decisions
on
the
spot,
and
they
should
not
be
second-guessed
by
the
court.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
--
whether
qualified
immunity
is
--
was
clearly
established
in
june
of
2006,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
primary
case
relied
upon
by
the
tenth
circuit
was
the
skoog
case.
the
skoog
case
was
the
case
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
upon
in
holding
that
hartman
should
not
be
extended.
it's
important,
though,
when
you
review
the
skoog
case
to
--
to
read
the
entire
case,
because
the
skoog
court
after
concluding
that
--
that
hartman
should
not
be
extended,
still
proceeded
with
the
qualified
immunity
analysis
to
determine
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
incident.
and
what
the
skoog
case
concluded
was,
it
looked
at
--
it
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
right.
and,
you
know,
we
know
from
the
anderson
v.
creighton
case
that
this
court
has
said
it's
important
when
focusing
on
constitutional
rights
not
to
look
at
the
30,000-foot
level,
not
to
look
at
the
high
level,
but
to
look
at
the
contours
of
the
right.
and
that's
what
the
skoog
case
did.
mr.
sean
r.
gallagher
all
right.
thank
you.
