mr.
david
a.
lane
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
solution
being
offered
by
the
government,
and
now
we
have
to
go
find
the
problem.
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer's
question
was
directed
at
here.
i
have
done,
not
a
scientific
search,
but
i
can
take
credit
for
a
little
bit
of
science
involved
in
determining
how
many
such
cases
arise.
and
at
page
13
of
our
brief,
we
cite
in
footnote
8
that
a
search
with
no
time
limitations
whatsoever
going
back
in
lexis
with
the
words
1983>
["],
15
reported
federal
appellate
cases,
with
no
time
limitations
whatsoever.
so
we
had
a
solution,
but
we
really
don't
have
a
problem.
the
only
secret
service
case
that
this
court
has
ever
heard
that
i'm
aware
of
involving
anything
remotely
like
this
is
hunter
v.
bryant.
so
this
is
not
a
significant
problem.
this
also
factually
is
probably
not
the
best
case
for
them
to
be
making
their
argument
that
we
need
some
sort
of
special
rules
that
apply
to
the
secret
service,
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
mr.
howards
by
all
accounts
walked
over
to
the
vice
president,
looked
at
him
and
said:
"i
just
want
you
to
know
i
think
your
policies
in
iraq
are
disgusting.
"
there
is
a
dispute
at
that
point
whether
he
gently
patted
him
on
the
arm
--
not
a
crime
--
or
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
--
again,
not
a
crime
--
or--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
incidental
contact
is
not
an
assault,
and
everyone
under
law--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
the
problem
is
that
the
vice
president
was
on
the
mall
having
contact
with
numerous
people,
shaking
their
hands,
letting
them
pat
him
on
the
back,
telling
him
what
a
great
job
he's
doing.
mr.
david
a.
lane
and
then--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
under
colorado
law,
he
was
charged
with
harassment,
and--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lane
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lane
that's
a
multi-faceted
question.
i'll
try
my
best
to
cut
right
to
it.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
that
is
part
of
the
point
i
have
to
make
here,
all
right.
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
fourth
amendment
issues,
what
is
going
on
in
the
agent's
mind
is
irrelevant.
the
issue
is--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--right.
first
level
of
inquiry,
was
there
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
no,
according
to
the
tenth
circuit.
we
then
have
got
to
shift
gears
if
we
are
going
to
do
a
first
amendment
analysis.
and
is
this
a
retaliatory
arrest
or
not?
we
have
got
to
look
into
the
subjective
mind
of
the
agent.
that's
where
justice
ginsburg's
questions
i
think
take
on
great
import
for
this
discussion.
because
as
she
correctly
pointed
out,
the
agents
on
scene
never
said
in
deposition,
they
have
never
claimed
anywhere
that
they
arrested
mr.
howards
on
a
1001
violation.
the
agents
on
scene
in
deposition
said
we
arrested
him
because
of
the
way
he
approached
the
vice
president
--
not
a
crime
--
and
his
demeanor.
we
thought
it
might
be
an
assault.
that
later
morphed
into
a
state
charge
of
harassment.
nobody
ever
said
1001
formed
any
basis
whatsoever.
mr.
david
a.
lane
right.
mr.
david
a.
lane
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
lane
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
lane
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lane
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well
that--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
i
think
you
hit
on
the
solution
as
part
of
the
problem
you
just
expressed,
and
that
is
can
they
stop
this
individual.
and
the
answer
is
absolutely
yes.
they
have
every
arrow
in
their
quiver,
under
terry
v.
ohio.
they
can
stop
him
if
they
perceive
a
threat.
they
can
force
him
to
open
up
his
opaque
bag,
they
can
force
him
to
show
them
what's
in
the
box
inside
the
opaque
bag.
they
can
pat
him
down,
they
can
wand
him
with
a
metal
detecting
wand.
they
can
assure
themselves--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--they
are
allowed--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--they
are
allowed
to
take
reasonable
steps
under
terry,
under
every
conceivable
case
that
this
court's
ever
decided--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--no.
no.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--it
would.
it
would.
if
he
could
prove
that
they
did
a
terry
stop
on
him
in
retaliation
for
his
free
speech
and
it
was
motivated
--
and
i
know
this
--
your
honor's
feelings
about
intent
--
intent
motivated
constitutional
torts.
but
if
he
could
prove
that
the
terry
stop
was
motivated
by
--
in
an
effort
to
punish
him
for
his
free
speech,
yes,
that
would
be
a
cause
of
action
as
well.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
--
as
i
said
the
arrows
in
the
quiver
of
the
court,
to
weed
out
those
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
i
mean,
litigious
plaintiffs
are
a
consistent
problem
across
the
board
under
many
contexts.
and
there
is
really
--
there
is
almost
nothing
that
can
be
done.
this
court
has
taken
steps
to
cut
back
prison
litigation
that
is
frivolous,
and
things
of
that
nature.
but,
yes,
if
the
heightened
pleading
standard
this
court
enunciated
in
iqbal.
you
can't
just
come
up
with
conclusory
allegations,
you
have
to
have
facts
in
support
that
that's
why
they
stopped
me,
because
of
my
bumper
sticker.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--no,
that
doesn't
necessarily
go
to
trial.
that's
a
conclusion,
first
of
all--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
i
mean,
these
evidentiary
questions
have
to
be
first
of
all
supported
in
a
pleading
with
heightened
scrutiny
under
iqbal.
conclusions
are
not
simply
enough.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
let
me
give
the
flip
side
of
that
and
say
if
the
police
officer
did
stop
him
because
of
the
bumper
stick
he
should
go
to
trial.
he
should
be
held
accountable
for
that--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--theoretically
every
single
person
who
has
ever
been
arrested
for
any
crime
could
raise
a
first
amendment
retaliation
lawsuit.
every
convicted
murderer
doing
time
throughout
this
country
could
do
that.
they
don't
however.
there
is
not
a
rush
to
the
courthouse
of
retaliatory
arrest
claims
because
the
pleading
requirements
are
heightened,
qualified
immunity
for
over
100
years
has
protected
the
secret
service.
they
have
been
protecting
the
executive
branch--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--i'm
ready.
mr.
david
a.
lane
yes.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
let's
take
a
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
tenth
circuit
found
there
was
probable
cause
for
a
1001
violation.
but
was
there
probable
cause
--
is
there
a
great
body
of
circumstantial
evidence
surrounding
this
case
that
would
point
to
probable
cause
which
should
be
considered
in
deciding
how
this
case
proceeds?
we
have
the
agent
in
charge
of
the
protective
detail,
agent
lee,
standing
eight
inches
away
from
vice
president
cheney
when
this
entire
encounter
occurs.
agent
lee
testified
he
saw
no
crime
committed.
we
had
numerous
agents--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--the
evidence?
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
there
were
discreet
first
amendment
episodes
that
occurred
in
the
context
of
this
case.
one
was
testified
to
by
mr.
howards
in
his
deposition,
that
when
he
first
of
all
was
approached
by
agent
reichle,
agent
reichle
said,
"i
want
to
talk
to
you.
"
and
flashed
his
badge,
and
mr.
howards
declined
the
invitation
to
talk
to
agent
reichle.
that,
according
to
mr.
howards,
angered
agent
reichle.
that
is
a
first
amendment
significant
event
in
and
of
itself.
steve
howards
testified
that
he
then
was
asked
by
agent
reichle
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
assaulting
the
vice
president,
and
his
response
was
i
didn't
assault
the
vice
president;
i
merely
criticized
his
policies
in
iraq,
and
if
you
don't
want
him
criticized
publicly
he
should
stay
in
his
undisclosed
location,
or
words
to
that
effect.
again,
mr.
howards
testified
that
angered
agent
reichle.
at
that
point,
the
cuffs
went
on.
and
i
think
that
is
circumstantial
evidence
in
support
of
the
animus
for
what
--
what
was
going
on.
agent
reichle
was
on
notice
as
to
what
howards
had
said
to
the
vice
president--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
again--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--lying
to
the
vice
president
is
what
we
look
at
on
a
fourth
amendment
analysis,
because
what's
in
reichle's
actual
mind
under
devenpeck
is
irrelevant.
so
yes,
there
was
probable
cause,
but
was
reichle
himself
directing
his
animus
at
mr.
howards
and
arrested
him?
we
have
to
look
into
what
was
actually
in
his
mind,
and
that
was
not
in
his
mind.
a
1001
violation
was
not
in
his
mind.
we
looked
--
what
was
in
his
mind,
and
we've
--
we
have
already
said
what
was
in
his
mind
is
he
approached
the
vice
president,
he
criticized
him
publicly--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
that
line--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
first
of
all
there
has
not
been
this
constant
barrage.
hartman
has
only
applied
until
--
i
mean,
this
court
decided
hartman
in
2006
for
retaliatory
prosecutions.
there
has
not
been
a
run
on
the
courthouse
on
retaliatory
arrests.
either
before
hartman
or
after--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--this
may
not
help
my
case,
but
i
will
go
further
than
that
and
i'll
say
any
police
officer
has
an
absolute
right
to
listen
to
what
any
protester
is
saying
and
consider
what
is
being
said
in
terms
of
assessing
the
level
of
threat
that
that
protester
poses.
but
as
i
said
in
this
case,
they
had
every
right
to
stop
mr.
howards,
to
do
a
terry
stop
on
him,
because
they
were
concerned
about
him.
and
reasonable
cause
for
concern
under
terry
is
the
standard.
you
don't
need
probable
cause
to
pat
someone
down
under
terry.
it's
simply
if
a
reasonable
officer
would
be
concerned.
mr.
david
a.
lane
i'm
not
saying
that
they
are
immune
on
a
terry
patdown
if
it
is
done
in
retaliation
for
free
speech.
i'm
simply
saying
that
would
make
it
a
much
more
difficult
case
for
any
protester
to
go
to
a
--
to
go
to
court
and
say
the
only
reason
he
patted
me
down
was
in
retaliation
for
free
speech.
mr.
david
a.
lane
sure.
mr.
david
a.
lane
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
a.
lane
so--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--first
order
of
business--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--let's
see
if
he's
a
threat.
mr.
david
a.
lane
he's
supposed
to
--
if
he
--
if
he
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
steve
howards
is
a
threat--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--okay.
right.
then
he
pats
him
down,
he
opens
the
bag--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--nothing
there.
mr.
david
a.
lane
then
they
monitor
him
and
they
watch
him,
and
--
and
that's
all.
mr.
david
a.
lane
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
believe
he
has
committed
a
crime
at
that
point.
mr.
david
a.
lane
but
they
didn't
know
that.
that
was
not
in
their
minds.
that's
--
we
are
doing
a
first
amendment
analysis
and
not
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
at
this
point.
first
amendment
analysis--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--but
it
was
never
in
their
minds.
they've
testified.
that
didn't
have
anything
to
do.
that
is
the
tenth
circuit's
post
hoc
rationale
under
devenpeck
which
--
devenpeck
--
which
says
if
you
--
there's
any
objective
probable
cause
that
the
tenth
circuit
or
this
court
or
any
other
court
can
concoct,
post
hoc,
even
though
it
wasn't
in
the
officer's
mind,
that's
good
enough
to
arrest
somebody.
that's
--
that
probable
cause.
all
right?
but
in
first
amendment
analysis
it
can't
be
an
objective
standard.
you
--
there
--
objective
standards
are
clean,
they
are
nice,
they
--
they
create
bright
lines.
but
when
we
are
looking
at
a
first
amendment
violation,
we
have
to
got
to
be
able
to
get
into
subjective
intent
of
the
officer
at
--
on
the
scene.
mr.
david
a.
lane
no,
they
don't.
mr.
david
a.
lane
because
if,
first
of
all,
as
i've
said,
iqbal
requires
heightened
pleading,
not
just
conclusions.
we
have
the
summary
judgment
standard.
mr.
david
a.
lane
we
have
a
summary
judgment
standard,
where
--
and
in
fact
in
butz,
this
court
held
that
a
firm
application
of
rules
of
civil
procedure
will
always
prevent
frivolous
claims
and
meritless
litigation
from
occurring
in
situations
exactly
like
this.
and
that's
true.
a
firm
application
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
a
summary
judgment
standard
which
is--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--there
is
no
easy
way
out
of
this,
unfortunately.
frequently,
when
you're
talking
about--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
that
unfortunately
is
an
easy
way
out
of
the
first
amendment
as
well.
i
mean
this
court
has
decided
some
incredibly
difficulty
cases.
snyder
v.
phelps,
authored
by
your
honor,
very
difficult
case.
could
it
be
side-stepped,
by
--
you
know,
somebody
steps
off
a
curb
and
is
thereby
jaywalking
walking.
are
we
limiting--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
what
i
say
about
that
is
that
--
and
again,
i
know
this
is
not
an
answer
that
you
are
probably
going
to
like,
because
this
means
a
trial
is
involved,
but
this
is
what
juries
do
on
a
daily
basis
throughout
this
country,
in
every
criminal
case.
what
is
the
subjective
intent
of
the
defendant?
in
every
civil
case,
is
this
an
intentional
act,
a
knowing
act,
a
reckless
act,
a
negligent
act?
that's
what
juries
do.
and
if
there
is
enough
evidence
to
get
this
case
to
trial
--
and
i
--
i
would
posit
it
that
in
this
case,
where
you
have
agent
after
agent
after
agent
who
saw
the
encounter
up
close
and
personal
with
the
vice
president
and
mr.
howards,
none
of
whom
saw
any
evidence
of
any
criminal
activity
by
mr.
howards,
all
of
whom
let
mr.
howards
walk
away
from
the
scene,
that's
good
evidence
that--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--well,
i
mean,
theoretically
yes,
that
--
that
could
be
a
problem.
and
--
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
certain
civil
litigants,
just
as
in
criminal
cases,
people
are
wrongly
accused
of
things
that
they
didn't
do,
they
end
up
in
a
trial,
and
sometimes
juries
get
the
wrong
results
and
an
injustice
occurs.
we
can't
fix
all
those
problems
when
it's
not
really
a
significant
problem.
there
are
no
run
on
the
courtrooms
around
the
land
of
these
kinds
of
cases
arising.
we
don't
need
to
have
any
rules
that
specifically
pertain
to
the
secret
service
when
to
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
had
one
secret
service
case
in
its
entire
history,
and
there
are
15
appellate-reported
federal
decisions
regarding
retaliatory
arrests,
period--
mr.
david
a.
lane
--the
--
the
only
way
i
know
to
look
for
that
is
on
westlaw
or
lexis.
and
--
and
mr.
srinivasan
indicated
that
they
found
100
or
400
cases.
we
did
a
search
like
that,
we
came
up
with
the
same
number.
we
dug
down
into
those
cases.
and
in
terms
of
actual
litigated
retaliatory
arrest
cases,
we
found
15
total.
that's
not
scientific,
but
that's
the
best
i've
got
for
you
at
this
point.
and
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
repository
of
--
of
where
we
can
find
that
or
not.
but
this
--
and
i
started
this
argument
by
saying
"this
is
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem.
"
the
secret
service
has
adequately
done
their
jobs
beautifully
over
--
for
over
a
century.
and
--
and
there
is
no
reason
to
put
some
different
rule
down
on
the
secret
service.
mr.
david
a.
lane
well,
they're
doing
the
best
they
can.
i
mean,
that's
--
i
understand
that.
but
it
is
--
it
is
a
serious,
serious
issue
to
curtail
the
first
amendment.
consider
the
--
the
situation
where
you
actually
do
--
and
i
believe
this
is
that
case
--
you
have
secret
service
agents
who
deserve
to
be
taken
to
a
trial,
because
they
have
gone
out
of
their
way
to
punish
someone
for
their
free
speech.
what
do
you
do
about
those
guys?
mr.
david
a.
lane
you
know,
that
would
be
a
fact
to
be
considered
by
the
jury.
i
could
lose
this
trial
when
we
go
back.
if
we
get
a
trial.
that's
what
jury
trials
are
all
about,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i
have
to
show
evidence
to
this
court
that
i'm
going
to
win
the
trial
before
i
win
this
case.
the
issue
simply
is
can
we
sacrifice
the
first
amendment.
you
know,
does
a
litterbug
lose
their
right
to
have
first
amendment
free
speech?
does
a
jaywalker
lose
their
right
to
have
first
amendment
free
speech
because
probable
cause
exists
to
believe
they've
committed
some
offense?
and
you'll
have
officers
ostensibly
enforcing
litter
laws
and
jaywalking
laws
and
blocking
the
sidewalk
laws,
and
the
first
amendment
is
essentially
evaded.
100
years
of
jurisprudence,
courageous
jurisprudence,
many
times
by
this
court,
goes
by
the
boards
because
somebody
is
a
litterbug.
i
--
i
just
don't
see
that
as
the
solution
to
this
problem.
and
i
also
don't
see
that
the
secret
service
needs
some
enhanced
protection
from
this
court
when
this
has
never
been
and
is
not
now
any
kind
of
a
serious
problem.
the
status
quo
is
not
healthy.
it
has
worked
for
decades
and
it
should
continue
to
work.
and
if
these
agents
get
tagged
in
this
case,
maybe
they
deserved
to
get
tagged
in
this
case,
because
the
first
amendment
is
extremely
important.
and
i
don't
denigrate
the
--
the
job
of
law
enforcement
or
--
or
these
agents
in
any
way.
i'm
simply
saying
that
when
the
first
amendment
is
at
stake,
i
think
--
and
the
law
has
been
working
just
fine
throughout
decades
to
extend
the
no
probable
cause
in
hartman
to
on-street
encounters
where
there
is
no
complex
causation
chain
--
where
the
main
actor
in
hartman
was
immune
completely
from
lawsuit,
the
prosecutor
in
hartman
could
not
be
sued
under
any
circumstances,
nor
could
the
prosecutor
in
hartman
be
questioned
in
deposition
under
our
traditions.
we
don't
question
prosecutors
in
depositions
about
why
they
made
decisions
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute.
so
this
court
stepped
back
in
hartman
and
said,
that's
a
different
story.
but
on-street
encounters
--
if
you
extend
the
no-probable-cause
requirement
to
on-street
encounters,
any
road
the
police
officer
or
secret
service
agent
who
wants
to
can
--
can
ostensibly
enforce
any
number
of
legal
violations
--
1
mile
an
hour
over
the
speed
limit;
you're
going
to
jail,
allegedly
for
going
1
mile
an
hour
over
the
speed
limit.
or
under
atwater,
for
not
wearing
a
seat
belt
--
when
the
real
reason
is
your
bumper
sticker.
if
you
can
prove
that,
they
should
go
to
trial.
absent
any
further
questions,
i'll
sit
down.
thank
you
very
much.
