justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
that
--
that's
exactly
what
justice
breyer
is
saying.
okay?
which
is,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
some
literature
that
talks
about
should
we
be
treating
misdemeanor
arrests
different
than
felony
arrests,
because
there
is
less
discretion
that
an
officer
would
have
with
respect
to
arresting
someone
for
a
felony
than
for
misdemeanors
or
criminal
fines,
because
like
jaywalking,
policemen
don't
arrest
you
for
jaywalking
unless
they
are
either
on
a
ticket
binge
or
because
there's
something
about
you
that
they
don't
like.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
that
something
about
you
they
don't
like
is
that
you
are
wearing
an
antiwar
armband,
are
we
going
to
let
that
plaintiff
not
recover,
because
somehow
we
need
to
protect
police
officers
so
much,
in
the
discretionary
use
of
this
vast
power
they
have
to
arrest
that
we
are
going
to
permit
them
to
trample
the
first
amendment,
essentially?
or
are
we
going
to
say,
in
the
normal
situation
there
is
a
first
amendment
claim,
even
with
probable
cause,
if
you
can
prove
that
it's
the
motivating
factor
for
the
arrest;
but
we
treat
secret
service
differently?
and
i
think
that
was
the
point
justice
breyer's
getting
to,
and
the
one
i'm
most
interested
in.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
are
jaywalking,
there
is
probable
cause.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
--
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
violating
the
first
amendment,
meaning
if
police
officers
have
discretion
and
they
would
not
otherwise
arrest
you
except
for
their
dislike
of
your
speech,
that's
a
violation
of
your
right
to
free
speech,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
can
go
to
that
question
later.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
a
sense
of
how
many
of
these
first
amendment
retaliatory
claims
in
those
jurisdictions
that
permit
them
--
i
know
they
are
more
limited
--
how
many
of
these
cases
arise?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
how
many
arrests
are
there
a
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
millions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
let's
go
past
this
for
a
second.
what
was
it
that
the
arresting
agent
said
or
did
that
showed
the
animus
--
meaning
that
because
that
another
officer
actually
saw
it
and
understood
himself
what
he
thought,
doesn't
mean
that
this
agent
who
was
told
that
there
had
been
a
touching
had
that
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
know
collective
knowledge
is
a
theory
in
a
lot
of
cases,
but
let's
deal
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
what's
--
what's
the
animus?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
does
all
of
that
prove
your
point
of
animus
in
light
of
the
undisputed
fact
that
he
lied
about
touching
the
vice
president?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
do
understand
that
this
case
is
inviting
the
questions
the
chief
justice
asked,
which,
and
which
has
--
justice
breyer
and
some
of
us
are
concerned
about,
which
is
what
your
adversary
has
described
as
first
amendment
voicing
is
going
to
be
a
part
of
many,
many
arrests.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
we
draw
a
line
outside
of
the
one
that
you
proposed
by
your
adversaries,
that
probable
cause
is
the
line.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
enmesh
the
police
in
a
constant
barrage
of
claims
that
just
because
they
angered
a
police
officer,
that's
why
they
were
arrested.
