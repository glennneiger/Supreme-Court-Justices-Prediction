mr.
michael
a.
delaney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
eyewitness
identification
implicates
due
process
concerns
only
when
the
police
arrange
a
confrontation
to
elicit
a
witness's
identification
of
a
suspect
and
use
unnecessarily
suggestive
techniques
that
skew
the
fact-finding
process.
the
central
concern--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--i'm
not--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--that
may
play
a
role,
justice
sotomayor,
but
only
in
a
limited
sense,
and
not
in
the
way
the
petitioner
is
suggesting
we
look
at
unintentional
conduct.
first,
for
the
due
process
inquiry
to
trigger,
there
must
be
an
arranged
confrontation
of
a
suspect
and
a
witness
by
the
police.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
the
difference
in
this
case
is
the
role
that
the
police
played
in
bringing
about
potential
suggestion
under
your
hypothetical.
what
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned
about
is
the
role
of
the
police
in
essentially
stacking
the
deck,
putting
their
thumb
on
the
scale
and
skewing
the
fact-finding
process.
it
goes
to
the
intent
of
the
process--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--well,
first,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
go
there
in
this
case.
you
can
simply
say
that,
based
on
the
factual
findings
of
the
state
court,
the
police
did
not
induce
any
type
of
show-up--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
it
is
quite
different.
and
stovall
tells
us
that
the
test
is
an
objective
one.
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
suggestive
conduct.
now,
in
that
regard--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
not
make
a
difference
in
that
regard.
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
do
have
clear
factual
finding
that
this
police
officer
in
no
way
--
in
no
way
induced
this
witness
to
move
towards
the
window
and
identify
a
suspect
who
just
happened
to
be
standing
next
to
a
police
officer.
if
the
concern
under
due
process
in
this
area
has
been
a
deterrence
rationale,
which
this
court
has
stated
in
both
neil
v.
biggers
and
in
manson
v.
brathwaite,
that
must
be
the
guiding
principle.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that
is
true,
justice
kagan,
that
--
that
the
opinions
have
discussed
both
issues.
and
i
would
offer
two
considerations.
first,
to
the
extent
that
the
courts
have
talked
about
reliability
as
the
linchpin
or
the
likelihood
of
misidentification
playing
a
role,
they
have
only
done
that
read
in
context
within
and
only
after
an
unnecessarily
suggestive
circumstance
that
they
had
applied.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that
is
correct,
and
if
we
expand
that
out
and
we
apply
that
rationale
to
the
circumstances
of
a
case
not
involving
police
activity,
we
lose
that
deterrence
rationale.
there
is
no
deterrence
involved
in
a
suggestive
circumstance
that
does
not
involve
the
police.
civilians
are
not
going
to
be
repeat
players
in
this
system.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
and
that
is
the
biggers
test.
and
if
we
looked
at
reliability
further
as
sort
of
the
touchstone
of
our
due
process
inquiry,
we
would
need
to
misplace
completely
the
role
of
examining
whether
the
suggestive
circumstances
are
unnecessary.
an
--
an
inquiry
into
necessity
only
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
a
police
investigation
or
police
work.
and
if
we
look
at
stovall,
certainly
there
is
an
example
of
a
case
that
was
a
show-up,
where
this
court
said
that,
despite
the
clearly
suggestive
circumstances,
that
show-up
was
imperative
and
necessary
because
the
witness
may
have
been
about
to
die.
the
court
did
not
conduct
a
reliability
analysis.
so
if
reliability
is
the
linchpin,
it
puts
the
stovall
holding
in
question
and
really
stovall
would
be
undermined.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
and
the
analogy
i
would
use
would
be
to
your
perjury
cases.
in
mooney
you
have
clearly
set
a
due
process
standard
that
prevents
police
or
prosecutors
from
knowingly
using
false
evidence.
and
the
concern
there
is
how
the
police
will
skew
the
fact-finding
process.
stovall
and
the
identification
cases
are
very
similar
to
that.
our
concern
in
essence
is
that
the
police
through
unnecessary
suggestion
in
that
circumstance
are
going
to
skew
the
fact-finding
process
and
in
this
instance,
in
essence,
create
a
false
or
altered
memory.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
it's
--
the
standard
is
not
reliability,
justice
alito.
the
standard
for
due
process
in
this
area
is
the
use
of
orchestrated
police
suggestion.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
that
is,
and
we
have
both
constitutional
and
non-constitutional
tools
and
procedures
right
now
to
address
that.
at
the
base,
we
require
prosecutors
under
jackson
v.
virginia
to
have
some
minimum
level
of
evidence
so
that
a
rational
trier
of
fact
can
establish
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
above
that,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
we
provide
tools
and
procedures
that
allow
a
defendant
to
assess
the
reliability
of
evidence
through
cross-examination
and
summation
and
the
right
to
counsel.
and
beyond
that,
we
have
non-constitutional
sources
under
the
rules
of
evidence
that
are
specifically
designed
to
assess
the
relevance
and
the
reliability
of
the
evidence.
but
if
we
go
before
that
and
say
that
the
due
process
clause
after
all
that
has
some
additional
standing
in
--
in
your
jurisprudence
to
assess
reliability,
we
really
have
gone
to
a
very
different
place.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
no,
justice
alito.
those
cases
are
quite
different.
and
to
the
extent
we
did
have
objective
evidence
that
the
police
here
had
in
some
way
brought
that
woman
to
the
window
to,
in
essence,
conduct
a
show-up,
then
we
may
have
triggered
the
first
prong
of
biggers.
and
the
court
would
then
be
required
to
do
two
things:
first,
to
determine
whether
the
circumstances
were
suggestive;
and
independent
of
that,
also
determine
whether
it
was
necessary
or
not,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
investigation.
so
if
in
fact
the
police
officer
had
directed
the
witness
to
the
window,
there
may
be
at
least
grounds
for
the
biggers
and
manson
analysis
to
come
into
play.
these
facts
are
very
different
from
that.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
well,
if
we
do
look
back
to
determine
whether
the
circumstances
involving
the
police
are
any
more
--
of
more
serious
concern,
if
we
look
back
to
wade,
this
court
did
talk
about
the
unique
role
of
police
suggestion
in
this
context
of
confrontations.
and
it
specifically
focused
on
the
manner
and
the
degree
of
suggestion
in
which
the
manner
that
police
or
prosecution
present
a
witness,
presents
a
witness
to
a
suspect,
what
impact
that
can
have.
that
unique
aspect
of
police
suggestibility,
the
fact
that
a
police
officer
when
it
brings
someone
forward
is
going
to
influence
a
witness
to
a
high
degree,
does
play
a
role
and
is
the
grounds
upon
which
the
stovall
cases
have
been
built.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
you
would
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
and
to
the
extent
from
an
objective
standpoint
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
the
police
intentionally
brought
that
witness
back
to
the
scene--
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
--and
i
--
and,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not
trying
to
create
that
complication.
and
in
fact,
i
would
--
i
would
reference
the
state
court
decision
a
little
bit
differently.
it
did
ground
its
holding
specifically
in
a
finding
that
there
were
no
sort
of
suggestive
techniques
at
play
here
and
no
inducement.
the
trial
court
order
very
specifically
said
it
disagrees
with
the
show-up
characterization,
that
the
witness
had
pointed
out
the
petitioner
without
any
inducement
from
the
police
officer.
the
officer
did
not
direct
the
witness's
attention
to
the
window,
and
the
officer
did
not
ask
whether
a
man
in
the
parking
lot
was
the
man
who
broke
into
the
cars.
on
those
facts,
that
can
dispose
of
this
case
without
getting
into
the
issue
of
mens
rea.
mr.
michael
a.
delaney
yes.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
inquiry
under
the
--
under
the
first
prong
of
biggers
is
just
that.
it's
an
objective
inquiry
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
because
the
defendant's
conviction
was
the
product
of
a
fair
trial,
because
the
state
court
properly
applied
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
precedent
in
the
area
of
eyewitness
identification,
and
because
the
petitioner's
proposed
rule
would
markedly
expand
this
court's
due
process
jurisdiction,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
state
court
judgment
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
