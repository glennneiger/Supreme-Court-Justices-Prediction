mr.
guerriero,
if
it's
not
--
if
it's
not
limited
to
suggestive
circumstances
created
by
the
police,
why
is
unreliable
eyewitness
identification
any
different
from
unreliable
anything
else?
so
shouldn't
we
look
at
every
instance
of
evidence
introduced
in
criminal
cases
to
see
if
it
was
reliable
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
our
cases
which
exclude
or
--
or
require
reversal
when
there
is
eyewitness
testimony
impaired
by
the
police,
you
think
that's
really
limited
to
eyewitness
testimony?
suppose
the
police
created
suggestiveness
in
another
category
of
evidence.
let's
say
--
let's
say
voice
evidence,
that
the
killer
had
left
a
message
on
the
--
on
the
phone
and
the
police
in
some
manner
create
suggestiveness
that
causes
a
witness
to
identify
that
as
the
voice
of
the
killer.
you
really
think
that
we
would
say,
well,
this
is
not
eyewitness
testimony;
eyewitness
testimony
creates
a
special
risk?
don't
you
think
that
we
would
say
whenever
the
police
render
evidence
unreliable
it
--
it
should
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
but
--
but
that
--
that
impairs
your
--
your
argument,
because
if
we
accept
your
argument
for
eyewitness
we
should
similarly
accept
it
for
everything
else.
there
is
nothing
special
about
eyewitness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
we
don't
mean
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
that
it's
unbelievable
that
if
the
--
if
the
police
created
testimony,
not
eyewitness
testimony
but
testimony
that
was
unreliable
because
of
police
suggestiveness,
i
think
we
would
throw
that
out
as
well.
don't
you
think
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
--
what
about
unreliable
eyewitness
testimony
in
favor
of
the
defendant?
let's
assume
the
same
suggestiveness
that
causes
you
to
exclude
it
when
it's
been
introduced
by
the
prosecution,
but
here
it's
being
introduced
by
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
somebody
else,
okay?
is
that
going
to
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it
should
be
excluded
under
the
rules
of
evidence?
if
you
say
it's
so
unreliable
--
this
is
a
one-way
door?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
the
evidence
that
--
that
causes
the
defendant
to
be
convicted
is
excluded,
but
--
but
any
--
any
evidence
--
any
evidence
on
the
other
side
is
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
see,
when
--
when
it's
the
state
that
causes
the
unreliability,
i
can
see
why
it
is
a
--
a
ground
that
can
be
invoked
only
by
the
defendant.
but
when
you
come
up
with
a
theory
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
state
was
the
cause
or
not,
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
work
both
ways,
that
the
evidence
is
inherently
unreliable
and
it
ought
to
be
excluded
whether
it
helps
the
defendant
or
hurts
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
--
once
you
take
the
state
out
of
the
mix
there
is
no
reason
to
limit
it
to
the
--
to
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
not?
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
why
not?
what
about
an
eyewitness
identification
from
200
yards?
you
know,
normally
you'd
leave
it
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
would
say
that's
very
unlikely.
but
you
want
to
say
it
has
to
be
excluded
and
if
it's
not
you
retry
the
person.
what
is
magic
about
suggestiveness
as
opposed
to
all
of
the
other
matters
that
could
cause
eyewitness
identification
to
be
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
--
we
face
that
problem
anyway,
even
if
we
--
whether
or
not
we
decide
in
this
case
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
police
manipulated
it,
we
are
always
going
to
have
the
problem
of
when
has
there
been
police
manipulation;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
--
that's
not
a
creation
of
this
--
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
--
i
would
guess
that
in
the
case
you're
talking
about,
just
telling
the
person
to
stay
where
he
is,
is
not
--
now,
it
would
be
different
if
--
if
the
defendant
was
--
was
caught
two
blocks
away
and
the
police
bring
him
back
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
make
him
stand
there
so
that
the
woman
can
see
him
from
the
window.
that's
quite
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
that
to
the
jury.
what
jury
isn't
going
to
be
--
i
mean
the
more
persuasive
your
argument
is,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
a
jury
will
take
care
of
that.
