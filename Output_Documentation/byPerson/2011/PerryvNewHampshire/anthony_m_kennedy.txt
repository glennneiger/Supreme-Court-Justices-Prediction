justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
suppose
that
the
police
talked
to
this
--
to
the
lady
that
was
in
the
--
in
the
apartment
and
saw
the
thing
out
the
window
and
said,
we
--
we
think
we've
solved
this
case
but
you
can't
look
at
this
man.
we
don't
want
to
you
look
at
this
man.
don't
tell
us.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
look
out
that
window.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
defendant
might
have
a
due
process
argument
that
the
police
interfered,
that
she
couldn't
say
right
when
he
was
there,
that's
not
the
man.
i
don't
know
what
you
want
the
police
to
do
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been,
a,
risking
this
argument
from
the
defendant,
and
b,
improper
police
conduct,
not
to
ask
the
woman
is
this
the
man?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
again,
that
was
in
the
context
of
procedures
that
the
police
had
instituted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
--
and
your
rationale
goes
much
beyond
it.
in
a
way
you're
infringing
on
the
province
of
the
jury.
i
don't
usually
like
to
reminisce,
but
there
was
a
case
i
had
where
a
prosecution
witness
was
very,
very
certain,
all
too
certain,
and
i
said:
do
you
ever
take
your
wife
out
to
dinner
or
go
out
to
dinner
with
friends?
and
he
said:
oh,
yes.
i
said:
has
it
ever
happened
to
you
that
midway
in
the
meal
you
say,
is
that
our
waiter,
and
you've
seen
--
the
waiter
has
brought
you
the
menu,
he
has
taken
your
order,
he
has
brought
your
food,
and
you
were
under
no
stress
at
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
was
good
light.
so
you
teach
the
jury
this
way.
and
you're
just
--
you're
just
usurping
the
province
of
the
jury,
it
seems.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we've
said
in
our
case,
neil
v.
biggers
--
that
was
a
rape
case
and
we
allowed
it.
we
allowed
the
eyewitness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
in
fact
we
said
that
it
was
unnecessarily
suggestive,
but
that
it
was
still
reliable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
you're
--
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
in
the
answer
to
justice
kagan,
was
that
there
is
really
a
two-part
step.
first,
was
the
police
procedure
unnecessarily
suggestive?
and
then
if
it
was,
are
there
other
reliability
--
was
reliability
impaired?
so
you
go
--
you
ask
both
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
about
cases
with
inflammatory
evidence,
too
many
lurid
photos
or
testimony
that
ignites
prejudice
in
the
community?
that's
--
that's
a
--
that's
reliability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
interesting.
i
was
trying
to
find
a
case
where
some
other
class
of
evidence
was
excluded
because
it's
unreliability.
and
in
thompson
v.
louisville,
as
you
say,
is
just
insufficient
evidence,
and
that's
different.
inflammatory
evidence
might
be
an
example.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
lurid
photos
or
something
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
there
were
some
early
cases
when
fingerprint
testimony
couldn't
come
in,
when
fingerprint
technology
was
just
new.
i
don't
know
if
those
were
due
process
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
--
was
the
daubert
case
our
expert
witness
case
where
you
have
to
have
a
threshold
showing?
was
that
due
process
or
was
that
just
--
that
was
just
rule
of
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
tea
leaf
reading
okay?
