justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--go
ahead.
you
were
saying
on
a
case
--
all
you
want
to
do
is
red-flag
it
for
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
how
does
that
differ
from
what
exists
in
i
think
every
state
and
certainly
in
the
federal
rules
in
rule
403?
the
judge
may
exclude
evidence
if
its
relevance
is
outweighed
by
its
prejudice
or
misleading
the
jury.
so
why,
in
any
instance
where
you
think
that
this
statement
about
to
come
in
is
unreliable
for
various
reasons,
you
say:
judge,
will
you
please
look
please
look
at
rule
403;
i
have
some
experts
over
here
and
whatever
else
you
want
that
would
show
that
this
is
misleading
to
the
jury
for
all
the
reasons
you
have
said
in
your
brief,
right.
so
--
so
since
that
is
already
the
law
and
it
does
apply
to
every
piece
of
evidence,
including
all
the
things
we've
been
talking
about,
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
change?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
what's
different
about
it.
i'm
not
looking
for
a
difference.
i'm
looking
--
i'm
saying
they
are
all
the
same.
and
indeed
we
do
what
you
want
right
now.
it's
called
rule
403
in
the
federal
system.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
what
is
it
you
want
done,
since
all
you
want
is
the
judge
to
look
at
it
carefully,
that
is
not
done
at
this
moment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
judges
don't,
i'm
sure
--
i'm
not
100
percent
sure,
you'd
have
to
ask
a
trial
judge.
but
i
am
sure
there
are
instances
where
judges
say
under
rule
403:
i
conclude
it
is
misleading
and
it
is
prejudicial
and
it
can't
be
made
up
for,
therefore
i
exclude
it.
all
right,
that
happens.
now,
since
that's
what
you
want
the
judge
to
do,
i
repeat
my
question:
what
is
the
difference
between
what
you're
asking
for
and
what
already
exists
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unless
--
well,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whoa,
wait.
stop
you
there,
because
now
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
is
it
isn't
the
case
that
you
simply
want
the
judge
to
look
at
this
with
care,
rather
you
want
the
judge
to
change
her
result.
you
want
sometimes
this
to
be
excluded
where
under
403
it
is
sometimes
not
excluded.
right.
now,
i
ask
--
if
that's
what
you
want,
that's
a
different
matter.
that's
a
substantive
standard.
and
so
you're
proposing
a
different
substantive
standard
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is.
