justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
take
it
from
your
--
i
take
it
from
your
answers
that
simple
unreliability
is
not
enough.
if
there's
testimony--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--eyewitness
testimony
that
seems
of
very
dubious
unreliability,
that
cannot
be
excluded.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
something
more
is
needed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
something
more
is
needed;
suggestiveness
is
needed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
suggestiveness
doesn't
require
any
police
involvement?
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
just
define
what
you
mean
by
suggestiveness?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
those
are
all
situations
where
the
police
is
involved,
the
police
are
involved.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
you
have
cross-racial
identification?
would
that
qualify
on
the
ground
that
studies
have
shown
that
those
may
be
less
reliable.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
i
need
to
know
what
you
mean
by
suggestiveness.
what
does
that
mean?
can
you
just
give
me
a
definition
of
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
would
be
really
a
great
change
from
the
way
trials
are
now
conducted,
wouldn't
it.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
a
victim
is
raped
and
the
victim
doesn't
really
have
a
very
good
opportunity
to
see
the
perpetrator.
it's
dark,
the
person
has
a
mask
and
so
forth.
a
couple
of
weeks
go
by
and
the
victim
reads
on
article
in
the
paper
that
says
so-and-so
has
been
arrested
for
a
rape
in
another
part
of
the
city.
there
is
a
picture
of
that
person
in
the
paper
and
the
victim
says,
that's
the
person
who
raped
me.
now,
you
want
to
make
it
possible
for
the
judge
to
say
that
victim
may
not
testify
and
identify
the
person
that
that
person
--
that
the
victim
says
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
rape,
on
the
ground
that
the
newspaper
picture
was
suggestive,
even
though
there
wasn't
any
police
involvement
and
when
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances,
the
identification
is
unreliable.
now,
maybe
that's
a
good
system,
but
that
is
a
drastic
change,
is
it
not,
from
the
way
criminal
trials
are
now
conducted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
know
of
cases
like
that
in
which
the
judge
has
said
that
eyewitness
identification
cannot
come
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
you're
saying
--
what
you're
saying
seems
to
suggest
that
the
rule
we're
talking
about
here
is
really
not
an
aspect
of
due
process
per
se,
but,
like
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
it's
a
special
due
process
exclusionary
rule
that
is
meant
to
deter
conduct
that
could
result
in
a
constitutional
violation.
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
--
if
the
exclusionary
aspect
of
this
is
not
part
of
due
process
itself,
then
doesn't
it
follow
that
what
due
process
requires
is
reliability?
so
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
petitioner's
argument
is
correct,
the
due
process
standard
is
simply
reliability,
not
suggestiveness?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
--
you
have
two
cases.
you
have
mr.
perry's
case
and
you
have
another
case
that's
very
similar.
in
fact,
it's
identical,
except
that
in
that
instance
the
police
officer
talking
to
the
witness
said,
would
you
take
a
look
out
the
window
and
see
if
you
recognize
anybody.
now,
from
the
perspective
of
the
defendants,
the
cases
are
--
seem
--
as
far
as
whether
they
get
a
fair
trial,
the
cases
are
identical,
are
they
not?
the
evidence
is
the
same.
the
suggestiveness
is
the
same.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
was
intrigued
by
what
your
brief
said
about
federal
rule
of
evidence
403.
do
you
think
that
a
federal
judge
under
that
rule
may
exclude
the
testimony
of
a
witness
on
the
ground
that
the
witness
is,
in
the
judgment
of
the
trial
judge,
completely
unbelievable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
think
in
theory
that
could
be
done?
so
if
you
put
on
a
cooperating
witness
in
the
case
and
this
witness
has
made
100
inconsistent
statements
previously
and
has
been
convicted
of
perjury,
that
the
judge
can
just
say
you
can't
put
that
witness
on
because
that
person
is
--
is
a
liar,
and
i'm
not
going
to
have
the
witness
testify
in
my
courtroom?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
surely
is
some
minimal
due
process
requirement
for
the
admission
of
evidence,
isn't
there?
are
you
saying
there
is
none?
if
the
state
abolished
the
hearsay
rule,
could
it
--
would
it
not
be
a
violation
of
due
process
if
the
prosecution
introduced
quadruple
hearsay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
--
you're
right.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
let's
say
you
have
--
the
state
puts
on
a
witness
who
--
who
says
this
person
did
it
because
i
saw
it
in
my
crystal
ball.
