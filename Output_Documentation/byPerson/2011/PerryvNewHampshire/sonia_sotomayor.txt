justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
does
your
position
depend
on
police
involvement
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
if
a
private
investigator
shows
a
picture
or
--
that
has
no
connection
to
the
police,
a
company's
investigator?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
the
news
media
publishes
a
picture
of
someone
that
it
thinks--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
we've
changed
the
language
of
wade
when
it
talks
about
intentional
or
unintentional.
and
you're
suggesting
that
police
manipulation
always
has
to
be
intentionally
suggestive?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
the
policeman
tells
you
he
wasn't
really
thinking
or
focusing
on
a
distinguishing
characteristic
in
the
line-up?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
you
think
would
have
happened
here?
there
was
a
reason
the
police
asked
this
defendant
to
stay
put.
they
didn't
want
him
to
leave
the
scene,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
your
judgment
--
i
think
justice
kennedy
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
my
suspicion
is
that
at
some
point
they
would
have
asked
the
witnesses
in
the
building
and
engaged
in
a
show-up.
what's
so
different
between
intentionally
doing
the
show-up
and
holding
the
defendant
in
the
back
yard
standing
there
next
to
a
police
officer,
so
that
anyone
who
wants
to,
like
this
woman,
who
wants
to
find
the
guy,
can
just
point
to
that
one?
what's
the
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
i
mean,
the
way
not
to
skew
it
was
to
put
him
in
the
police
car
and
just
let
him
sit
there
in
the
dark.
so
they
intentionally
made
him
wait
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
this
was
necessary
or
unnecessary,
because
i
think
that
a
perfectly
good
argument
could
be
made
that
the
police
acted
reasonably
and
necessarily;
all
right?
it
makes
no
sense
to
move
a
defendant
that
far
from
the
scene
of
a
crime
if
you're
not
sure
he
is
the
one
who
committed
the
crime,
he
or
she.
but
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
the
question
of
how
do
we
define,
if
we
write
this
opinion,
manipulation
without
getting
into
a
mens
rea
type
analysis
and
adding
yet
another
layer
to
biggers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
tell
me
--
they
gave
the
hypothetical
of
the
police
pointing
out
the
defendant
out
the
window.
but
earlier
you
said
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
the
defendant
was
two
blocks
away
and
they
brought
him
back.
same
scenario.
they
do
that,
bring
him
back
two
blocks;
make
him
stand
at
the
scene
of
the
crime;
and
go
upstairs,
talk
to
the
woman
and
she
spontaneously
says:
it's
the
guy
standing
over
there.
that
would
entitle
the
defendant
to
a
wade
motion?
to
a
wade
hearing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
now
--
we
are
now
at
mens
rea
again.
so
what
has
surprised
me
about
this
case
is
in
some
ways
the
way
the
state
court
wrote
this.
because
if
the
state
court
had
simply
said
something
like,
there
was
no
unnecessary
show-up
here,
they
were
just
holding
someone
until
they
could
figure
out
what
happened,
there
was
no
suggestiveness
by
the
police,
because
the
woman
pointed
out
the
window,
throw
out
the
motion,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
argument
has
become
something
else
now
because
you're
trying
to
define
a
level
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
create
unreliability
that
i
think
just
complicates
the
inquiry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what's
happened
is
that
your
briefing
and
your
counter's
briefing
is
broader
than
i
think
needs
to
be
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
putting
that
aside,
you've
addressed
this
as
the
need
for
police
manipulation.
if
you
define
it
that
way,
then
we
do
get
into
a
mens
rea
discussion
rather
than
what
i
think
biggers
and
wade
were
about,
which
is
are
the
circumstances
created
by
the
police
unnecessarily
suggestive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
already
follow
your
adversary
rules.
i
think
it's
not
just
one
or
two.
it's
about
five
or
six.
the
floodgates
open
there?
how
many
--
how
many
suppressions
of
witness
identification
has
occurred
in
those
circuits?
