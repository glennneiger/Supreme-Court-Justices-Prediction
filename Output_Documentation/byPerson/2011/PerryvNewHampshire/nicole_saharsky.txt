ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
due
process
inquiry
is
required
only
when
there
is
a
police-arranged
confrontation
in
order
to
obtain
an
identification
and
then
the
police
unnecessarily
suggest
that
a
certain
suspect
is
guilty.
and
that's
because,
as
the
state
has
said,
the
court's
central
concern
in
these
cases
is
the
state
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scales,
gaining
an
unfair
advantage.
just
as,
as
justice
scalia
said,
the
state
can't
create
a
false
document
and
introduce
it
at
trial,
it
can't
manipulate
someone's
memory
and
then
use
that
evidence
to
prove
guilt
at
trial.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
saying
that's
where
the
court's
cases
are
now.
the
state
can't
knowingly
introduce
perjured
testimony,
but
you're
not
talking
about
perjured,
knowingly
perjured
testimony.
if
the
question
is
just
unreliable,
the
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
--
it's
rejected
claims
like
that
and
said:
the
constitution
doesn't
protect
to
ensure
all
evidence
is
reliable.
it
provides
a
process
by
which
the
court
can
test
reliability
through
cross-examination,
confrontation,
et
cetera.
the
court
has
--
and
that
was
in
crawford.
the
court
has
also
said
--
if
i
can
just
add
one
more
thing
--
in
the
due
process
context,
that
where
the
check
comes
in
is
in
jackson
v.
virginia,
that
the
verdict
has
to
have
enough
evidence
to
be
supported
each
element
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
that
a
rational
jury
could
find
it.
so
that
is
a
due
process
check.
but
where
the
court's
cases
stand
today,
the
court
has
not
found,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
a
case
where
it
said
that
the
mere
introduction
of
unreliable
evidence
would
isolate
the
due
process
clause.
and
every
time
it's
been
confronted
with
a
claim
like
that,
in
dowling,
for
example,
in
colorado
v.
connelly,
the
court
has
rejected
such
a
claim.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
is
an
extreme
example.
there
are
many
reasons
why,
a,
the
prosecution
would
never
introduce
that
kind
of
evidence
to
begin
with,
and
b,
that
there
would
be
other
checks
on
the
process
in
addition
to
the
confrontation
and
cross-examination
types
of
things
that
we
talked
about.
there
would
be
a
check
on
the
process
through
brady
and
giglio,
for
example,
that
if
the
government
knew
that
those
were
the
circumstances
of
the
identification,
they
would
have
to
turn
that
evidence
over
to
the
other
side.
there
would
also
be
checks
in
terms
of
the
trial
process
if
the
government
actually
put
on
evidence
like
that.
so
it
is
--
it
is
very
unlikely
that
such
a
thing
would
happen.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
court
has
to
hold
in
this
case
that
due
process
could
never
play
a
role
there.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
this
is
very
routine,
run-of-the-mill
evidence.
someone
who
saw
what
happened
and
wants
to
come
into
court
and
tell
the
jury
that,
and
as
justice
kennedy
noted,
you
know,
what
petitioner
is
asking
for
here
is
to
take
all
of
those
away
from
the
jury,
really
usurping
the
jury
function
and
having
these
mini
trials
where
the
court
itself
is
trying
to
decide
reliability.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
i
mean,
that's
different
because--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
mean,
there
you
have,
first
of
all,
a
separate
constitutional
provision
of
an
impartial
jury,
and
have
you
a
direct
influence
upon
the
jury.
so
it's
not
just
unreliable
evidence
being
a
due
process
problem.
you
have
this
separate
sixth
amendment
protection
and
then
you
have
it
acting
directly
on
the
jury.
so
we
think
that's
a
different
case.
in
the
due
process
context
where
the
court's
cases
have
really
focused
is
on
the
states
tilting
the
scales,
the
states
corrupting
the
process
by
knowingly
introducing
perjured
testimony,
or
by
for
example
refusing
to
disclose
material
exculpatory
evidence--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
can't
say.
i
mean,
when
you
look
at
the
court's
more
current
cases
though,
to
the
extent
the
court
has
heard
argument
like
this
evidence
is
too
unreliable,
we
needed
a
special
constitutional
rule.
for
example,
in
ventris,
with
respect
to
jail
house
snitches,
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
when
the
court
was
told
in
colorado
v.
connelly
there
were
concerns
about
reliability.
it
said:
no,
reliability
is
up
to
the
jury,
and
it
uses
the
state
rules
of
evidence,
and
this
court's
not
going
to
be
a
rule-making
organ
for
rules
of
procedure.
the
constitution
puts
in
place
the
various
checks
on
the
process:
compulsory
process,
cross-examination,
et
cetera.
and
then
outside
of
that,
it's
really
the
role
of
the
states
to
mold
the
trial
process.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i
mean
you
would
need
to
meet
the
standard
of
rule
403
which
is
that
the
--
the
probative
value
of
the
witness
would
be
substantially
outweighed
by
unfair
prejudice.
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
evidence
would
--
of
an
eyewitness,
which
the
court
has
said,
particularly
in
cases
like
biggers
and
manson,
is
fairly
probative,
important
evidence;
the
court
wanted
to
let
it
in,
even
in
the
circumstances
if
where
you
know,
the
police
played
a
role
in
manipulation.
so
probably
no,
the
court
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
take
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
mean
rule
403
isn't
talking
about
whether
evidence
is
true
or
false.
it's
talking
about
unfair
prejudice
to
the
jury,
unfair
prejudice
being
--
outweighing
the
probative
value
of
the
testimony.
so
you
know,
i
think
it
would
be
a
--
call
for
the
judge
in
that
individual
case.
i
don't
know
that
that
--
that
that
kind
of
argument
has
been
made
very
often.
but
it's
not
just
that
trial
protection;
there
are
numerous
trial
protections
outside
of
the
constitutional
limits
that
the
states
have
put
into
place
specifically
with
respect
to
eyewitness
identification
testimony.
for
example,
there
are
special
jury
instructions
that
most
states
use,
and
new
hampshire
used
special
jury
instructions
here.
and
there
is
something
that's
really
notable
about
these
instructions,
which
is
that
what
petitioner
wants
is
when
the
jury
has
made
a
determination
here,
looking
at
factors
like
how
far
was
the
witness
away
from
the
person,
how
long
was
it
before
--
between
the
crime
and
when
she
made
the
identification
--
the
jury
heard
all
of
those
factors,
heard
argument
on
it,
was
instructed
on
those
things
and
it
made
a
determination;
and
what
petitioner
wants
is
for
a
trial
court
--
this
court,
after
the
fact
--
to
use
those
exact
same
factors
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
it
was
just
interpreting
rule
of
evidence
70
--
702.
so
you
know,
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
--
what
petitioner
is
really
asking
for
is
not
some
kind
of
threshold
inquiry,
but
really
taking
the
question
of
reliability
away
from
the
jury,
and
it
would
be
a
very
big
change
in
our
system.
and--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
is
not
many,
but
the
principle
the
petitioner
is
arguing
for
is
a
significant
one.
it
is
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
against
--
protects
reliability,
and
i
assure
you
that
once
this
court
says
that
this
is
the
case,
that
there
will
be
defendants
throughout
the
united
states
making
arguments
about
all
different
kinds
of
evidence
not
involving
the
police
being
unreliable,
and
that
that
all
needs
to
be
taken
away
for
--
from
the
jury,
and--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
there
are
some
state
rules
of
evidence
that
do
that,
but
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
as
a
matter
of
due
process
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
at
trial
to
not
allow
--
this
--
to
--
this
evidence
if
given
to
the
trial
would
be
fundamentally
unfair.
and
you
know,
the
constitution
has
enshrined
the
jury
as
the
fundamental
guarantee
--
the
fundamental
protector
of
liberty;
and
to
think
that
that
same
constitution
through
the
due
process
clause
means
that
run-of-the-mill
evidence
has
to
be
taken
away
from
the
juries,
that
the
trial
court
can
itself
look
at
factors
like
how
good
of
a
view
the
person
had?
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i
think
that
there
would
initially
be
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
confrontation
clause
and
the
court
would
probably
go
through
the
analysis
that
way.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
that
i
would
give
is
the
same
one
to
the
question
justice
kagan
asked,
which
is
where
the
court
is
now,
the
court
has
never
that
the
introduction
of
some
kind
of
evidence
is
so
unreliable
it'd
violate
due
process.
in
dowling,
for
example,
it
had
evidence
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--what
i'm
saying
is
the
court
doesn't
need
to
address
that
question
here.
it
also
doesn't
need
to
foreclose
it.
but
this
is
very
run-of-the-mill
evidence.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
could
never
find
that
some
kind
of
evidence
is
so
problematic
that
the
due
process
clause
could
preclude
its
admission,
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
fairly
run-of-the-mill
evidence.
i
would
just
point
the
court
to
the
decision
in
dowling
which
was
about
a
prior
conviction
for
which
the
person
had
been
acquitted;
and
then
that
evidence
was
let
in
at
his
trial,
and
he
said
that's
a
problem.
that
evidence
is
too
unreliable
and
too
prejudicial,
and
the
court
said
that's
not
for
the
due
process
clause.
the
constitution
gives
you
the
process
to
test
evidence.
it
doesn't
ensure
that
all
of
the
evidence
that's
going
be
introduced
be
reliable.
and
that's
what
petitioner
is
saying
here
today,
and
that
would
be
a
very
expansive
view
of
the
due
process
clause
that
just
can't
be
reconciled
with
cases
like
dowling
and
colorado
v.
connelly.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
we'd
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
