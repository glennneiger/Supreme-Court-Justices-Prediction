but
just
to
repeat
justice
scalia's
question,
once
you're
not
talking
about
police
suggestiveness,
once
you're
talking
about
suggestiveness
that
arises
from
non-state
conduct,
why
should
we
be
focused
on
suggestiveness
as
opposed
to
any
other
cause
of
unreliability?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
court
was
focusing
on
police
suggestiveness.
that's
the
context
of
all
our
cases.
now,
you
might
say,
well,
look,
there
is
a
bigger
problem
and
the
bigger
problem
is
the
unreliability
of
identifications
generally,
but
that
doesn't
relate
to
suggestiveness
per
se.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
that
there
was
some
other
category
of
testimony
which
proved
even
more
unreliable
than
the
category
that
you're
talking
about.
let's
say
that
it
turned
out
study
after
study
after
study
that
jailhouse
informants
lie.
and
so
the
testimony
of
jailhouse
informants
is
likely
to
be
just
completely
unreliable,
to,
you
know,
double
as
much
as
eyewitness
testimony.
same
rule
for
that?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
well,
now
we
are
talking
about,
now
we
are
setting
up
a
standard
that
applies
outside
eyewitness
testimony.
it's
just
testimony
that
we
find
to
be
--
categories
of
testimony
that
we
find
to
be
extremely
unreliable
will
be
subject
to
this
new
due
process
red
flag.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
understand
you
have
very
good
empirical
evidence
which
should
lead
us
all
to
wonder
about
the
reliability
of
eyewitness
testimony.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
eyewitness
testimony
is
not
the
only
kind
of
testimony
which
people
can
do
studies
on
and
find
that
it's
more
unreliable
than
you
would
think.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
both;
right,
general
delaney?
i
mean,
the
court
has
certainly
talked
about
deterrence,
but
the
court
also
has
very
substantial
discussions
in
all
of
these
opinions
about
reliability.
and
from
the
criminal
defendant's
point
of
view,
it
doesn't
really
much
matter
whether
the
unreliability
is
caused
by
police
conduct
or
by
something
else.
so
--
so
tell
me
a
little
bit
why
you
think
the
police
conduct
here,
you
know,
that
has
to
be
there
in
every
case?
justice
elena
kagan
it
seems
that
that's
not
right.
i
mean,
the
reason
we
want
to
deter
this
conduct
is
because
the
conduct
results
in
misidentifications
and
unreliable
testimony.
that's
the
reason
that
deterrence
is
an
important
goal,
is
because
this
conduct
leads
to
unreliable
testimony.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
justice
alito's
questions
about
why
there
should
be
this
difference
between
these
two
cases.
now
you
might
want
to
say
that
where
police
conduct
is
involved,
the
chances
of
unreliable
identification
are
greater.
or
you
may
want
to
say
something
else.
but
the
question
is:
if
we
are
focused
on
reliability,
why
are
those
two
cases
any
different?
justice
elena
kagan
so
do
you
mean
to
say,
miss
saharsky,
that
there
can
never
be
a
due
process
violation
from
the
admission
of
unreliable
evidence?
assuming
that
the
state
has
not
created
that
evidence,
has
not
produced
that
evidence,
but
the
state
knows
that
the
evidence
is
unreliable
or
has
a
very
substantial
chance
of
being
so,
that
that
can
never
be
a
due
process
violation?
justice
elena
kagan
i'll
give
you
an
extreme
example.
the
extreme
example
is
where
an
identification
has
been
produced
by
torture,
but
the
torture
has
been
through
a
non-state
actor.
same
answer?
