chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
10-8974,
perry
v.
new
hampshire.
mr.
guerriero.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
it
--
this
may
be
--
just
again
following
up
on
justice
alito's
question,
but
there
is
always
a
degree
of
suggestiveness.
it's
not
like
the
person
is
picked
randomly
off
the
street
and
saying,
you
know,
do
you
know
this
person?
it's
in
the
context
of
an
investigation.
the
person
has
some
contact
with
it.
so
there
is
always
some
suggestiveness
that,
well,
this
person
might
have
something
to
do
with
what
went
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
whenever
--
whenever
the
witness
is
asked,
at
least
there
is
a
suggestion
that
this
might
be
the
man.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
would
think
that's
any
greater
than
this
is
the
man.
the
police
don't
come
up
usually
and
say,
this
is
the
person
that
we
think
did
it;
is
that
who
you
saw?
they
say,
did
you
see
this
guy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
what
about
a
situation
like
the
one
we
had
here,
where
you're
not
talking
about
a
line-up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
talking
about
the
scene
of
a
crime,
and
the
police
says,
do
you
know
this
person,
did
you
see
this
person,
or
anything
else?
that
in
itself,
any
type
of
identification
in
the
course
of
an
investigation,
i
think
you
would
have
to
say
is
suggestive,
because
the
person
is
not
picked
up
randomly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
--
again,
this
is
just
following
up,
i
guess.
but
i
remember
in
law
school
one
of
the
things
in
criminal
law,
the
professor
says,
all
right,
everybody
be
quiet.
and
then
a
certain
amount
of
time
goes
by
and
then
he
starts
asking
people,
well,
how
much
time
went
by?
and
people
--
some
people
say
4
minutes,
some
people
say,
you
know,
1
minute.
and
it
turns
out,
if
i'm
remembering
correctly,
to
be
a
lot
shorter
than
most
people
think.
so
that's
at
least,
the
point
that
was
trying
to
be
made
anyway,
at
least
as
unreliable
as
eyewitness
testimony.
so
your
argument
would
have
to
cover
that,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
how
long
were
you
there
before
this
individual
came
into
the
shop?
the
person
says,
i
was
there
for
5
minutes,
and
that
ruins
the
person's
alibi,
when
it
turns
out,
you
know,
study
after
study
would
say
it
really
was
45
seconds
or
1
minute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
delaney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
that's
--
when
you
say
that's
different,
you're
not
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
that
would
be
suggestive,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
presumably,
that's
the
same
argument
--
that's
for
the
jury
and
the
counsel.
they
can
say
during
cross-examination
the
guy
was
two
blocks
away,
you
know,
and
--
and
wasn't
it
only
because
the
police
brought
him
back
that
you
--
all
of
that.
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
in
terms
of
whether
you
have
a
suppression
hearing
before
the
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
suppose
the
--
lie
detectors,
for
example,
that's
been
taken
away
from
the
jury
on
a
categorical
basis,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
guerriero,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-8974,
perry
versus
new
hampshire.
