so
at
least
for
all
eyewitness
testimony,
there
would
have
to
be
some
pretesting
for
reliability?
is
that
--
is
that
your
contention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
this
case,
in
which
category
do
you
place
the
eyewitness
testimony?
is
it
police
suggestion,
or
is
it
suggestive
but
not
through
any
manipulation
on
the
police's
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
answered
that
due
process
works
only
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
in
favor
of
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
is
your
only
--
your
only
distinction.
you
are
saying
that
this
is
a
one
--
one-way--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--street.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
distinguish
--
do
you
distinguish
the
husband's
situation?
he
was
an
eyewitness
too,
but
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
her
testimony.
is
that
an
example
where
there
is
an
eyewitness
testimony
but
no
suggestiveness?
why
didn't
you
move
to
suppress
the
husband's
statement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you'd
put
them
both
in
the
same
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
all
the
other
safeguards
that
you
have?
you
can
ask
the
judge
to
tell
the
jury:
be
careful;
eyewitness
testimony
is
often
unreliable.
you
can
point
that
out
in
cross-examination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
those
questions.
you
can
say
something
about
it
in
your
summation
to
the
jury.
and
as
justice
breyer
brought
up,
you
have
the
evidence
rule
that
says
if
prejudicial
value
outweighs
probative
value
that
the
judge
can
say,
i'm
not
going
to
let
it
in.
why
aren't
all
those
safeguards
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
leaving
aside
the
police,
because
there
--
there
is
an
interest
in
deterrence,
in
deterring
the
police
from
manipulating
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
difference
between
suggestive
and
suggested
by
the
police.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
suggestion
comes
from
the
police,
then
the
evidence
will
be
excluded.
if
the
suggestion
comes
from
someplace
else,
unless
we
change
the
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
would
be
admitted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
police
arrange
a
lineup
in
which
only
the
suspect
is
made
to
wear
distinctive
clothes
and
an
eyewitness
then
picks
the
suspect
out
of
the
lineup,
police
arranged
suggestive
circumstances,
we
have
held,
called
for
a
due
process
check
before
allowing
the
jury
to
hear
the
identification
evidence,
the
trial
judge
must
screen
it
for
reliability.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
barion
perry,
asks
us
to
extend
judicial
preview
of
eyewitness
identifications
to
all
suggestive
circumstances
not
just
those
organized
by
the
police.
for
reasons
explained
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
decline
to
do
so.
petitioner
perry
was
arrested
for
theft
after
an
eyewitness
identified
him
as
the
man
she
had
just
seen
breaking
in
to
a
car.
at
the
time
of
the
identification,
perry
was
standing
in
a
parking
lot
next
to
a
police
officer.
perry
moved
to
suppress
the
identification.
admitting
it
at
a
trial,
he
argued,
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
and
therefore
a
denial
of
due
process.
no
improper
police
conduct,
perry
conceded,
tainted
the
identification
in
his
case.
the
new
hampshire
trial
court
denied
the
supression
motion.
perry
was
tried
and
convicted
and
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
upheld
both
the
ruling
on
motion
and
perry’s
conviction.
we
affirm
the
state
court
judgment.
in
every
case,
in
which
we
have
invoked
due
process
to
require
a
trial
judge
to
prescreen
identification
evidence,
law
enforcement
officials
had
arranged
the
suggested
--
suggestive
circumstances
that
may
have
influenced
the
identification.
perry
so
acknowledges,
but
urges
a
broader
rule
one
requiring
trial
judges
to
preview
eyewitness
evidence
in
any
and
all
suggestive
circumstances
whether
or
not
police
are
involved.
a
prime
reason
for
excluding
identification
evidence
generated
by
police
under
unnecessarily
suggestive
circumstances
is
deterrence.
the
aim
is
to
stop
law
enforcement
officers
from
using
improper
arrangements,
for
example,
suggestive
lineups,
showups
or
photo
arrays
where
there
is
no
improper
police
conduct,
there
is
nothing
to
deter.
external
suggestion
is
hardly
the
only
factor
that
can
cast
out
on
the
trustworthiness
of
an
eyewitness'
testimony,
an
eyewitness
with
poor
vision
or
one
who
harbors
a
grudge
against
the
defendant
is
not
inherently
more
reliable
then
one
who
makes
an
identification
under
suggestive
circumstances,
but
perry
does
not
ask
us
to
extend
pretrial
screening
that
far.
he
maintains
that
eyewitness
identifications
made
under
suggestive
circumstances
are
a
uniquely
unreliable
form
of
evidence
and
so,
should
be
treated
as
a
special
category.
we
do
not
doubt
either
the
fallibility
or
the
importance
of
eyewitness
evidence
generally
or
the
caution
appropriate
whenever
suggestive
circumstances
may
have
influenced
an
identification,
but
in
our
system
of
justice,
the
jury,
not
the
judge,
ordinarily
determines
the
trustworthiness
of
the
evidence.
safeguards
are
built
into
our
system
that
can
serve
to
inhibit
juries
from
placing
undue
weight
on
eyewitness
and
other
testimony
of
questionable
reliability.
these
protections,
many
of
them
at
work
in
perry’s
trial,
include
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses,
eyewitness
specific
jury
instructions
and
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
defendant's
guilt
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
state
and
federal
rules
of
evidence,
moreover,
arm
trial
judges
with
discretion
to
exclude
relevant
evidence
if
its
probative
value
is
substantially
outweighed
by
its
prejudicial
impact
or
potential
for
misleading
the
jury.
absent
improper
police
conduct,
these
safeguards,
we
hold,
keep
the
introduction
of
eyewitness
identification
evidence
within
constitutional
bounds.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
