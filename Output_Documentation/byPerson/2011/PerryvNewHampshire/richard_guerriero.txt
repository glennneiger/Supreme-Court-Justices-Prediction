mr.
richard
guerriero
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
eyewitness
identification
made
under
a
suggestive
influence
presents
a
unique
danger
of
misidentification
and
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
it
is
that
danger
of
misidentification
which
implicates
due
process
and
requires
an
evaluation
of
the
reliability
of
the
identification.
the
constitutional--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
guerriero
what
i
suggest--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
have
a
two-part
answer
to
that.
the
--
the
significance
of
the
suggested
influence
is
how
it
affects
reliability.
most
of
the
time
that
influence,
the
defense
will
allege,
is
from
some
police
activity,
and
rightly
so
because
they
are
mostly
involved
and
rightly
so
because
police
suspicion
is
the
kind
of
influence
that
would
direct
the
witness's
attention
and
say
that's
the
man.
but
it's
not
necessarily
required,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
federal
court
of
appeal
cases,
dunnigan
v.
keane,
involved
exactly
that,
a
private
investigator,
where
a
private
investigator
from
a
bank
showed
surveillance
photos
to
the
witness
and
then
later
the
witnesses
made
an
id.
mr.
richard
guerriero
no,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
eyewitness
identification
evidence
is
unique,
and
i
think
that
this
court
recognized
that
in
wade
and
in
the
subsequent
cases,
in
fact
described
it
at
that
time
as
probably
the
leading
cause
of
miscarriages
of
justice.
and
in
fact
experience
with
the
dna
exonerations
that
we've
seen
recently
in
the
last
10
or
15
years
have
shown
that.
mr.
richard
guerriero
no,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
wade
and
the
subsequent
cases.
it's
the
combination
of
eyewitness
identification
testimony
plus
the
suggestive
influence
which
makes
--
which
brings
it
to
sort
of
the
height
of
suspicion
and
creates
the
greatest
risk.
mr.
richard
guerriero
in
our
case,
we
do
not
allege
any
manipulation
or
intentional
orchestration
by
the
police.
but
our
position
is
that
it
appeared
to
the
witness,
to
ms.
blandon,
that
mr.
perry
was
in
fact
a
suspect,
and
she
looked
down
and
there
was
that
suspicion.
now,
if
we
had
been
able
to
have
our
due
process
claim
heard,
the
judge
may
or
may
not
have
agreed
that
that
was
suggestive
and
created
a
risk.
but--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
think
that
may
be
a
separate
due
process
claim.
for
example,
if
the
police--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
--
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
there
is
something
special
about
eyewitness
identification
testimony.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
--
well,
i
think
that
in
any
case,
and
i
think
the
court
has
said
this
in
other
circumstances,
that
in
any
case
a
defendant
could
raise
a
due
process
claim
and
say,
either
because
of
the
way
the
prosecution
handled
the
evidence
or
because
of
the
--
the
combination
of
rulings
on
evidence,
that
there
was
a
due
process
violation
that
implicated
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i
disagree,
your
honor.
if
the
police
wanted
to
ask
her
to
make
an
identification,
they
could
have
done
a
line-up
procedure
or
a
photo
line-up
procedure
fairly
promptly
that
would
be
distinct
from
and
much
more
fair
than
the
show-up
at
the
scene.
and
there
was
no
emergency
or
exigency
here
that
would
require
a
show-up.
mr.
richard
guerriero
it
may
be
excluded
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
but
the
due
process
clause
doesn't--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--the
due
process
clause--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--well,
the
defendant
is
obviously
not
trying
to
deprive
the
state
of
its
liberty
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
is
trying
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
liberty
at
trial,
so
the
due
process
clause
would
not
apply
in
that
sense.
that's
not
to
say
that
there
wouldn't
be
evidentiary
grounds
for
the
state
to
raise
that
objection.
mr.
richard
guerriero
it
--
it--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
i--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--that's
right,
and
i
might
even
go
further.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
i
think
the
court
has
given
examples.
if
it's
effectively
a
show-up
or
a
show-up.
the
example
in
foster
involved
a
couple
of
different
kinds
of
suggestiveness.
one
was
where
the
police
did
a
line-up
where
the
defendant
was
the
only
common
person.
mr.
richard
guerriero
right.
the
nonpolice
examples
of
suggestiveness
that
rise
to
the
due
process
level
are
mostly
going
to
be
show-ups.
the
example
in
dunnigan
v.
keane
was
a
private
investigator
showing,
from
the
bank,
that
they
had
an
atm
card
that
was
stolen
from
the
person.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that
may
be
a
separate
grounds
to
move
for
a
jury
instruction
or
for
an
expert.
i'm
not
sure
that
--
we
certainly
don't
argue
here
and
it
wasn't
argued
below
that
that's
a
separate
due
process
ground.
mr.
richard
guerriero
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
it's
not
that
these
things
are
always
excluded,
and
in
fact
the
court
has
set
a
very
high
bar.
i
mean,
the
standard
is
this
evidence
is
excluded
only
if
it's
very
substantially
likely
to
lead
to
a
misidentification.
so--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--it
is
conduct
or
circumstances
that
point
--
that
tell
the
witness
that's
the
man.
and
most
commonly
it
would
be
showing
a
single
photograph
or
presenting
the
person
as
a
suspect
or
it
appearing,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
--
the
defendant
was
a
suspect.
and
that's
essentially
how
the
court
has
defined
it,
as
conduct
that
says
that's
the
man.
so
there
may
be
some
things
that
the
defense
argues
that
are
suggestive
and
the
trial
court
looks
at
it
and
says,
you
know,
that's
a
very
slight
suggestion.
you
say
he
is
the
only
guy
in
the
line-up
with
a
mustache.
i
don't
even
--
i'm
not
going
any
further.
i
don't
think
that's
sufficient
suggestion.
that
doesn't
qualify
as
saying
that's
the
man.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
because
that's
what
--
my
first
reason
is
that
that's
what
the
court
focused
on
in
wade
as
the
main
danger.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
i
think
our
position
is
in
between
there.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
have
eyewitness
evidence
excluded
generally
without
some
suggestiveness.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
if
the
suggestion
comes
from
a
nonpolice
source
or
if
it,
as
in
this
case,
involved
the
police
but
their
involvement
was
unintentional,
it's
just
accidental,
that
that
suggestiveness
should
still
be
considered
because--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--trial
counsel
simply
did
not
move
to
suppress
that
testimony.
i
don't
have
a
good
explanation
and,
to
be
frank,
i
would
have
filed
the
motion
to
suppress
his
testimony.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i
would
have.
mr.
richard
guerriero
that's
right.
and
if
it
rises
to
a
level
of
what
the
court
has
given
as
examples
of
a
show-up
or
the
same
defendant
appearing
in
a
line-up
or
something
else
that
says
that's
the
man,
then
that
raises
a
red
flag.
and
it's
not
a--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--actually,
i
disagree
with
that
aspect
of
your
question,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
i
think
the
proper
police
procedure
in
certainly
the
police
departments
that
i'm
familiar
with
will
instruct
the
witness
that,
do
not
assume
that
anyone
that
we
think
is
a
suspect
is
in
this
line-up.
and
that's
in
the
standard
witness
instructions,
and
they
may
even
do
multiple
line-ups
where
they
say,
okay,
we
are
going
to
show
you
three
sets
of
eight
and
the
suspect
--
or
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
suspect
in
any
of
them.
we
just
want
you
to
look
at
this
set
and
see
if
anyone--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
it
is,
but
the
key
is
that
it's
not
the
suggestion
that
results
in
exclusion.
it's
the
suggestion
that
raises
the
red
flag
that
allows
the
defendant
to
say,
would
the
trial
court
please
evaluate
this
according
to
the
standards.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
think
it's
important
to
look
back
at
what
the
court
said
in
wade
and
in
fact
how
what
the
court
said
in
wade
has
been
borne
out.
of
course,
there
is
aspects
of
unreliability
to
any
kind
of
evidence.
somebody
could
come
and
claim
that
there
is
issues
with
false
confessions
or
issues
with
forensic
evidence.
i
think
last
term
somebody
made
a
claim
--
tried
to
assert
a
claim
regarding
dna
evidence
that
was
akin
to
an
eyewitness
identification
claim.
but
the
point
is
that
this
kind
of
evidence
was
singled
out
by
the
court
and
recognized
as
having
particular
dangers,
and
it's
been
borne
out
by
the
studies,
not
psychological--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--it
may
be
that--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--right.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
this
is
a
special
category
of
evidence
that
has
to
be
red-flagged
by
or
can
be
red-flagged
by
the
defense
for
the
trial
judge
to
look
at
it
and
say--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--on
a
case
by
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
guerriero
and
then
the
trial
judge
would
look
at
it
and
in
the
rare
case
where
he
says
it's
very
substantially
likely,
which
we
agree
is
a
high
standard--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--well,
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question,
what's
different
about
this
evidence
is
that--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--the
analysis
under
403,
which
new
hampshire
of
course
has
as
well,
will
accord
a
certain
weight
and
value
to
the
opportunity
of
counsel
to
cross-examine
the
witness
and
to
make
arguments
to
the
jury.
and
unlike
any
other
kind
of
evidence,
this
court
has
said,
precious
though
it
is,
the
right
of
cross-examination
does
not
always--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--the
difference--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i'm
sorry.
the
difference
is
that
under
a
normal
403
analysis,
when
i
told
the
judge,
when
i
said
she
never
could
describe
his
face,
she
couldn't
even
say
what
clothes
he
was
wearing,
the
judge
will
respond
to
me
and
say,
that's
fine.
that's
all
great
fodder
for
cross-examination.
but
the
difference
with
this
kind
of
evidence
is
that
it's
not
just--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--it's
--
it's
the
standard
that
this
court
has
established,
if
it's
reasonably
--
reasonably
likely
or
substantially
likely
to
lead
to
a
risk
of
misidentification
at
trial,
very
substantially
likely.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
it's
certainly
not
the
change
from
what
the
law
is
in
the
federal
circuits
that
we
cited.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
one
of
the--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--in
thigpen
v.
cory,
which
is
a
sixth
circuit
case,
the
court
said
--
in
fact
they
specifically
used
the
phrase
"police
machinations"
--
that
this
did
not
arise
from
police
machinations.
it
was
basically
happenstance
in
that
case
that
the
witness
was
--
the
witness
identified
the
defendant
and
it
was
excluded
as
unreliable.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well
--
and
i
think
the
court
said
in
all
its
cases,
and
in
particular
in
simmons,
that
each
case--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--and
it
may
be.
i
mean,
it
may
--
you
could
have
an
extremely
--
you
could
have
a
--
the
police
could
do
a
show-up
intending
to
produce
an
id,
but
if
the
witness
got
a
very
good
look
at
the
person,
was
calm,
was
maybe
a
police
officer
like
in
brathwaite
and
the
court
said,
we
don't
care
how
deliberate
this
--
and
even
if
there
is
manipulation,
we
don't
care
how
much
of
that
there
is,
we
find
it's
reliable
here.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
high
burden
for
the
defense
to
meet
there.
but
if
the
finding
was
that
there
are
times
that
a
witness,
that
--
like
in
the
eyewitness
situation,
where
the
witness
truly
believes
that
they
are
identifying
the
right
person,
but
they
are
actually
not
and
it
could
result
in
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
then
i
do
believe
fundamental
fairness
requires
the
court
to
say
due
process
doesn't
allow
that
evidence.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
but
more
for
a
factual
reason
in
that
the
court
said
in
1967
that
this
is
the
leading
cause
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
the
studies
and
--
not
just
studies,
but
the
transcripts
and
records
of
actual
trials.
mr.
richard
guerriero
well,
maybe
if
somebody
else
came
along
and
said,
we've
done
a
study
and
we
find
this
kind
of
evidence,
that
in
75
percent
of
the
wrongful
convictions,
this
evidence
contributed
to
the
miscarriage
of
justice,
then
i
would
think
the
court
should
take
a
look
at
that.
but
i
don't
think
any
other
evidence
matches
that.
mr.
richard
guerriero
yes.
mr.
richard
guerriero
if
all
of
those
safeguards
were
enough,
even
when
the
police
made--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
don't
think
deterrence
is
the
primary
basis
of
the
court's
cases,
your
honor,
because
the
court
has
said
that
if
it
proves
to
be
reliable,
no
matter
how
manipulative
the
police
were,
this
evidence
comes
in.
so
the
basis
of
the
rule
is
not
primarily
determined
--
deterrence;
it's
the
risk
of
an
unfair
trial
and
the
risk
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--well
i
think
that
that's
a--
mr.
richard
guerriero
--i
mean,
i
think
that
that's
a
--
that's
a
tricky
issue
to
consider,
because
suggestion
coming
from
the
police
is
different
from
manipulation.
and
if
--
if
the
rule
is
unintended
suggestion
from
the
police
implicates
due
process,
then
perry
was
entitled
to
a
due
process
analysis,
because
the
unintended
suggestion
here
was
apparent
police
suspicion
as
he
stood
there.
mr.
richard
guerriero
thank
you.
mr.
richard
guerriero
i
will
try
to
make
three
points
in
those
2
minutes.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
circumstances
that
would
be
excluded
if
the
court
accepts
the
rule
proposed
by
the
state,
that
there
has
to
be
some
intentional
manipulation
or
intentional
orchestration.
suppose
that
rather
than
the
accidental
or
happenstance
show-up
we
had
here,
suppose
that
the
accident
was
in
the
line-up
at
the
police
station,
and
the
police
were
completely
in
good
faith,
getting
to
the
mental
state
issue,
but
in
spite
of
their
good
faith
there
was
suggestion
in
the
line-up.
would
the
trial
court
look
at
that
and
say
even
though
this
was
a
suggestive
line-up
we
are
not
going
to
consider
a
due
process
claim
because
it
wasn't
intentional
or
deliberate
manipulation?
we
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
principle
that
the
primary
evil
is
the
risk
of
misidentification.
consider
another
circumstance.
suppose
there
are
two
witnesses
at
the
police
station,
and
in
spite
of
the
best
efforts
and
good
rules
of
the
police,
witness
one
looks
at
the
line-up
and
then
--
or
looks
at
the
photo
line-up
so
that
they
can't
be
changed,
let's
say,
and
leaves
the
line-up
and
somehow
communicates
to
witness
two,
i
picked
the
one
on
the
bottom
at
the
right.
i
think
that's
the
one.
that
suggestion
would
be
very
powerful
from
the
person
who
experienced
the
very
same
crime.
mr.
richard
guerriero
the
problem
is
that
the
witnesses
who
have
--
are
under
the
suggestive
influence
actually
believed
what
they
are
testifying
to,
and
the
--
that's
why
the
court
said
in
wade
cross-examination
for
this
one
kind
of
evidence
--
not
floodgates,
but
this
one
kind
of
evidence,
cross-examination
may
not
always
be
enough.
the
witness's
sincerity
has
a
powerful
effect
on
the
jury.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
is
this
is
not
going
to
open
the
floodgates,
as
we
say,
or
create
a
slew
of
new
claims.
under
the
watkins
case
this
court
knows
that
there
--
there
is
not
even
required
to
have
a
separate
hearing
on
this
evidence,
and
the
reason
a
separate
hearing
isn't
required
is
because
these
issues
would
be
fleshed
out
in
front
of
the
jury.
this
is
only
a
question
of
what
legal
standard
applies
when
the
judge
hears
the
defendant's
objection
that
this
violates
due
process,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
so
it's
not
any
new
claims.
it's
not
any
separate
hearings.
it's
simply
a
question
of
what
exactly
is
the
due
process
rule.
thank
you.
