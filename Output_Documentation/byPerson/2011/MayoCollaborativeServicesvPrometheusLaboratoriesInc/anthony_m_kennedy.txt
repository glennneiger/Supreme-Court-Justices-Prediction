when
--
when
the
respondent
addresses
this,
will
they
take
issue
with
the
way
you
describe
what
has
been
preempted,
or
as
you
read
their
--
we'll
ask
them
--
but
as
you
read
their
brief,
is
this
crystal-clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
thinking
about
what's
preempted,
i
looked
at
the
diehr
case
involving
the
rubber
molding
and
the
constant
monitoring.
and
if
you
could
take
an
analogy
from
that:
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
there
was
a
system
of
measurements
that
you
take
every
half-hour
which
constantly
monitor
how
a
drug
is
being
retained
in
the
tissues,
and
that
there
is
a
protocol
for
the
admission
of
some
two
or
three
different
drugs
to
get
the
balance
right.
in
other
words,
it's
much
more
complicated.
is
there
some
point
at
which
that
is
patentable,
even
though
this
preempts
a
--
a
whole
range
of
--
of
different
choices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
hard
for
you
to
answer
--
you
know,
there's
a
million
hypotheticals.
but
i'm
just
trying
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--see
what
the
process
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
would
be
--
and
please
correct
me
--
the
difference
is,
is
that
what
the
respondent
is
claiming
is
a
--
a
patent
on
the
measurement
of
the
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they're
giving
a
different
answer.
i
mean,
that's
how
i
would
have
answered
the
question.
but
--
but
that's
obviously
not
the
right
way
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
nature
always
has
a
reaction
to
the
drug.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nature
always
has
a
reaction
to
the
drug.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
hard
to
resist
the
temptation
to
peek
into
the
obvious
component
or
the
nonobvious
component
and
then
go
back
and
apply
it
to
101.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
discipline
ourselves
to
talk
just
about
101
in
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
why
didn't
you
answer
her
first
question
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
not
patentable?
i
have
the
same--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
i
am
having
the
same
problem
as
justice
kagan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you
just
go
--
the
hypothetical
was
--
was
one
range,
one
result
--
pardon
me,
one
measurement,
one
result.
suppose
that
just
continued
over
a
range.
and
they
said
if
it's
40
then
you
have
this;
if
it's
50
you
have
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
we're
talking
about
summary
judgment.
it
seems
to
me,
rough
rule,
that
summary
judgment
would
be
much
more
easy
--
much
easier
under
101
than
102
and
103.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
couldn't
someone
come
up
with
the
idea
that
at
a
level
which
is
in
the
range
that
is
within
your
patent,
that
if
at
a
certain
level
for
a
certain
--
a
person
of
a
certain
age,
you
administer
a
new
drug,
you
have
a
new
result?
why
isn't
that
like
the
fax
machine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--petitioner
is
saying
that
if
you
think
about
that,
it's
an
infringement.
