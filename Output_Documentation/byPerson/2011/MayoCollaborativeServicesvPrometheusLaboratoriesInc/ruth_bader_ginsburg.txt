mr.
shapiro,
on
that
question
and
the
question
justice
scalia
just
raised,
the
government,
you
know,
has
taken
the
position
that
you
are
under
the
wrong
section.
it's
not
a
question
of
patentability,
but
you
used
the
--
the
example
of
the
finger,
you
said
it's
obvious.
so
why
didn't
you
raise
the
sections
that
the
government
says
would
have
been
the
appropriate
ones
on
the
novelty
or
anticipation
of
prior
art
and
obviousness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro
just
told
us,
when
i
asked
him
that
question
based
on
your
brief,
that
people
need
to
know
up
front
that
this
is
not
a
patentable
subject
matter;
very
important
that
it
be
101
and
not
102
and
103.
so
how
do
you
answer
his
rejection
of
the
adequacy
of
prior
--
as
it's
anticipating
prior
art
or
obviousness?
