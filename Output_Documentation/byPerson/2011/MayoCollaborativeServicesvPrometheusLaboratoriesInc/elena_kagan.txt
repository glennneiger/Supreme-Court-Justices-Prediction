is
there
--
mr.
shapiro,
is
there
a
patent
that
prometheus
could
have
written
that
you
think
would
have
met
the
101
test.
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
they
had
added
a
treatment
protocol
that
would
have
been
a
completely
different
case?
justice
elena
kagan
and
what
makes
it
a
completely
different
case?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that.
you
said
a
specific
number.
but
suppose
it
uses
ranges,
but
it
also
attaches
treatment
decisions
to
those
ranges?
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
the
idea--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
guess
the
question
--
the
question
i'm
asking
is,
in
your
response
to
me
is
the
difference
the
--
the
extent
of
the
ranges,
or
is
the
difference
that
there
would
be
clear
treatment
decisions
attached
to
those
ranges?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general,
i
read
you
in
part
as
saying:
don't
worry,
because
if
something
strikes
you
as
wrong
with
this
patent,
we
are
going
to
catch
it
under
102.
and
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
why
that's
true.
there
was
novelty
here.
there
were
some
doctors
who
figured
out
some
new
things,
which
was
new
ranges
of
effective
drug
treatment.
and
so
why
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
catch
this
as
a
102
matter?
if
there
is
a
problem
here,
it
seems
to
me
not
the
fact
that
there
was
something
new.
there
was
something
new.
it's
that
--
it's
something
else.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
bress,
here's
what
you
have
not
done.
what
you
haven't
done
is
say
at
a
certain
number
you
should
use
a
certain
treatment,
at
another
number
you
should
use
another
treatment.
i
guess
the
first
question
is
why
didn't
you
file
a
patent
like
that?
because
that
clearly
would
have
been
patentable.
everybody
agrees
with
that.
justice
elena
kagan
and
i
think
that
the
difference
that
people
are
noting
or
some
people
are
noting
is
that
this
is
not
a
treatment
protocol,
it's
not
a
treatment
regimen,
all
you
have
done
is
pointed
out
a
set
of
facts
that
exist
in
the
world,
that
exist
in
the
world,
and
are
claiming
protection
for
something
that
anybody
can
try
to
make
use
of
in
any
way
and
you
are
saying
you
have
to
pay
us.
justice
elena
kagan
i
thought
you
might
not.
