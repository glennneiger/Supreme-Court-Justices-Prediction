i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
think
that
this
patent
covered
the
actual
machine.
mayo
is
free
to
develop
a
new
machine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
--
it
actually
is
much
narrower
than
that.
it's
within
a
range,
two
ranges
actually.
and
so
it
has
already
changed
one
range,
and
that's
not
the
subject
of
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
lower
number
it's
proposing
is
infringing.
so
it's
not
as
broad
as
you
are
stating.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
took
that
position,
but
the
district
court
narrowed
it
to
15
percent,
to
15--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
can
offer
the
test.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
can
offer
the
test.
it
just
can't
recommend
the
dosage
to
the
doctor.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tests
do
two
things:
they
measure
something--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
therapeutic
range
does
something
else.
the
tests
can
happen.
the
doctor
gets
a
number.
what
the
doctor
does
with
that
number
is
a
different
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
don't
know
what
--
you
keep
saying
you
have
to
limit
the
product.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
told
me
that
there
is
a
different
range
for
the
treatment
of
skin
diseases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
presumably
there
are
different
ranges
for
treatment
of
other
diseases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
patent
has
not
limited
exploration
in
there.
you
are
claiming
it
has.
that's
an
issue
that
your
adversary
can
speak
to.
i
think
they
say
no
in
their
briefs.
but
the
point
is,
there's
still
a
limit
to
their
range.
you
are
claiming
at
one
point
they
said
it
was
limitless,
but
if
we
disagree
with
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
do
you
answer
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
shapiro--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
we
--
so
do
we
add
up
all
of
the
diseases
in
the
world,
all
the
potential
diseases,
and
pick
a
percentage
that
this
covers
within
that
range?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
justice
breyer
is
asking
you
for
something
that
doesn't
involve
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
involves
some
greater
answer
to
the
issue
of
limitation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
patents
of
this
type
are
out
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
novel.
what's
your
answer
about
why
this
is
novel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
my
problem
is,
if
we
call
this
just
simply
a
application
of
natural
phenomenon
or
of
a
natural
process,
why
are
treatment
patents
at
all--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--permissible,
meaning
if
someone
finds
out
that
at
level
300,
it's
bad,
and
tells
doctors
to
stop,
that's
natural,
too.
