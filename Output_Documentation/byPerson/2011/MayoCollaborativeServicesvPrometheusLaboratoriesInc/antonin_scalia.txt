i'm
--
i'm
not
comfortable
with
that.
i
mean,
it
depends
on
how
--
how
broad
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
up
to
700?
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
550?
justice
antonin
scalia
830?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
are
we
supposed
to
apply
that
kind
of
a
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
above
830
or
below
830?
which?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
seems
to
me
not
a
--
not
a
patent
rule
that
we
could
possibly
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't
--
doesn't
any
--
any
medical
patent
rely
on
natural
processes?
i
mean,
even
if
you
invent
a
new
drug,
what
that
new
drug
does
is
--
is
natural.
it
affects
the
--
the
human
physiognomy
in
a
certain
natural
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
--
is
it
therefore
precluded
from
patentability?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
different
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
another
one
of
your
arguments,
but
one
of
your
arguments
says
you
can't
patent
nature.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
that
relates
to
the
question
that
i
asked.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
tell
me
why
you
can't
patent
nature,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
does
that
render
it
nonpatentable
because
it's
not
novel?
is
that
the
reason
why
it
--
it
renders
it
nonpatentable?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
here;
we
are
not
talking
about
novelty,
are
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once
you
say
conventional
nature,
you
are
saying
it's
not
novel.
if
--
if
the
step
is
not
conventional,
it's
okay.
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
novel.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
they
--
what
if
they
just
split
up
the
patent?
they
--
they
got
one
patent
number
for
arthritis,
another
patent
number
for
transplants,
another
patent
number
for
each
one
of
the
autoimmune
diseases
you
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
each
of
them
be
okay,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
discovery
of
a
new
physical
change
in
the
body
caused
by
an
old
drug?
you
--
you
find
that
it
affects
another
part
of
the
human
system.
is
it
--
is
that
discovery
patentable?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
somebody
thinks
you're
wrong,
that
the
numbers
you've
come
up
with
are
wrong.
and
they
want
to
develop
better
numbers
that
will
--
will
help
the
medical
profession.
your
--
your
patent
occludes
them
from
doing
that.
am
i
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
the
solution
to
that
is
that
--
you're
saying
their
patent
is
not
useful.
that
would
be
your
defense.
