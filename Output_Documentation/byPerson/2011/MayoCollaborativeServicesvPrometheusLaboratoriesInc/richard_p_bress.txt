mr.
richard
p.
bress
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
out,
i
think,
with
answering
the
question
about
what
these
patents
cover
and
what
they
don't.
and
i'm
going
to
answer
that
really
not
because
i
think
it
has
any
relevance
to
the
101
issue.
i
actually
don't
think
it
has
any
relevance
to
101.
and
i
will
explain
that
it
does
perhaps
have
relevance
under
102
and
103
and
why
the
difference
matters,
if
i
may.
so
the
district
--
my
friend
is
correct
that
in
the
district
court
at
the
initial
infringement
stage,
before
the
court
decided
the
validity
of
the
patent,
we
argued
that
the
right
way
to
look
at
our
numbers
was
that
we
were
claiming
that
if
a
doctor
correlated
or
associated
a
number
greater
than
400
with
toxicity,
that's
what
we
were
claiming,
that
would
be
within
our
claim.
and
if
the
doctor
correlated
under
230
with
not
enough
drug,
well,
we
were
claiming
that
as
well.
now,
the
district
court
agreed
with
that
and
said
that
those
were
the
ranges.
but
then
it
confused
things
a
bit,
and
that's
where
we
get
to
the
15
percent
plus
or
minus
point.
the
court
also
said
--
and
by
the
way,
i
think
this
is
a
correct
reading
--
that
when
we
said
about
400,
that
means
plus
or
minus
15
percent
of
400,
and
about
230
plus
or
minus
230.
and
then
the
court
held
that
there
was
infringement,
but
it
held
it
for
two
different
reasons.
it
said
that
--
that
the
patent
for
mayo
--
or
the
--
i'm
sorry,
not
patent,
the
product
mayo
had,
which
by
the
way
was
awfully
close
--
it
was
235
to
450
--
fell
within
the
15
percent
on
the
top
side.
it
didn't
look
at
the
bottom
side
for
purposes
of
this
decision.
but
450
was
within
15
percent
of
400.
and
it
also
said
it
violated
it
because
450
is
greater
than
400.
at
the
court
of
appeals
we
argued
that
the
right
way
to
read
the
district
court's
opinion
was
that
you
had
to
actually
do
that
comparison,
that
the
ranges,
the
15
percents,
mattered
and
that
the
doctor,
in
order
to
infringe,
would
have
to
look
at
the
result
and
say:
is
this
or
isn't
this
greater
than
400
and
compare
it
to
400,
or
230.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that
reading
of
it,
and
that
reading
wasn't
disputed
by
mayo,
and
on
page
38
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
has
to
be
compared
to
a
predetermined
number.
i
think
you
could
go
either
way
on
this.
i
think,
frankly,
the
court
could
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
look
at
that,
perhaps.
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
there
was
no
objection
at
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
think
any
objection
to
how
the
court
of
appeals
understood
it
is
probably
waived
at
this
point.
now
for
why
it
doesn't
matter.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
the
broad
ranges
here,
in
other
words
if
there
is
a
problem
with
the
fact
that
we're
saying
over
400
indicates
toxicity,
let's
think
about
what
is
that
problem.
suppose
we
are
right.
i
mean,
at
this
stage
the
court
certainly
can't
presume
we
are
wrong
in
that.
so
let's
suppose
that
we
are
right.
if
we
are
right,
then
we
are
simply
claiming
the
fact
that
we
found,
that
after
you
administer
the
drugs
and
determine
the
metabolite
level,
if
it's
over
400,
it
indicates
toxicity.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
it
is
a
--
it's
according
to
a
law
of
nature,
and
i
will
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
term
j.e.m.
has
referred
to
the
difference
between
things
that
exist
in
nature
with
the
intervention
of
man
and
things
that
exist
without
the
intervention
of
man.
so,
for
example,
photosynthesis
would
be
a
process
that
is
a
natural
phenomenon.
on
the
other
hand,
cross-breeding
plants
to
create
a
new
variety,
that
wasn't
the
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
think
you
could
probably
get
a
patent.
i
think
you
could
get
a
patent,
your
honor,
on
the
use
of
a
lamp
to
induce
photosynthesis,
but
you
couldn't
claim
the
underlying
process,
is
all
i'm
saying,
of
photosynthesis.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
would
love
to,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
okay,
you
honor.
i
will
answer
them
in
turn
and
then
hopefully
i'll
get
back
to
my
range
and
explain
what
the
102
and
103
problems
are
with
that
for
you
all
as
well.
the
first
patent
you've
discussed,
which
is
how
best
to
use
fertilizer
essentially
for
plants.
patent-eligible
subject
matter,
but
clearly
novel
and
novel
in
a
way
that
you
could
get
rid
of
on
summary
judgment
just
as
fast
as
you
could
get
rid
of
it
on
101.
there
is
no
advantage,
in
other
words,
to
saying:
i
am
going
to
label
my
summary
judgment
motion
101
and
import
lack
of
novelty
into
that
versus
saying
i'm
going
to
label--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
the
law,
as
you
well
know,
recognizes
that
under
section
103,
if
something
would
have
been
obvious
to
someone
with
ordinary
skill
in
the
art--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
the
first
person
who
came
up
10,000
years
ago
with
the
best
way
to
do
--
to
use
fertilizer
in
a
way
that
nobody
had
ever
done
before
would
presumably
get
it.
if
your
question
is
at
what
level
of
sort
of
microns
you
can
draw
a
line
between
obviousness
and
novelty,
there
are
questions
of
fact
embedded
in
that.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
to
make--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i
will
try
very
hard
not
to
do
either.
your
honor,
this
court
has
looked
at
two
different
ways
to
try
to
limit
what
are
laws
of
nature,
abstract
ideas,
etcetera.
one
way
it
has
looked
at
is
to
say
we
need
something
physical;
it
has
to
be
in
the
world.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
move
things,
you've
got
to
transform
them,
you
have
to
apply
machinery
to
them,
that
sort
of
thing.
so
we
just
know
off
the
bat
you
are
not
literally
claiming
just
a
principle
in
the
air.
so
in
your
example,
if
you
used,
you
know,
machines,
implements,
et
cetera,
to
do
it,
at
least
we
would
know
that
much.
i
think
the
problem
that
your
honor's
raising
is
more
in
the
second
stage,
which
is,
okay,
it
isn't
just
a
mere
principle.
i
get
that.
but
are
we
as
a
practical
matter
preempting
an
abstract
idea
in
such
a
way
that
we
are
going
to
too
greatly
suppress
follow-on
invention.
and
the
classic
example
of
that,
your
honor,
is
the
morse
case,
of
course.
in
morse
there
were
two
different
claims
that
were
being
discussed,
actually
eight
different
claims
being
discussed.
but
one
of
the
claims
had
to
do
with
the
actual
invention
of
how
you
can
make
a
telegraph
work.
and
morse
described
a
working
telegraph
system
and
he
got
a
patent
for
that.
and
the
second
one
that
he
tried
to
claim
was
the
use
of
electricity
to
write
at
a
distance.
and
the
reason
he
didn't
get
that
one
is
that
it
was
expressed
at
such
a
level
--
high
level
of
abstraction,
that
it
would
preempt
many,
many
things
that
he
had
never
invented
and
never
thought
of.
in
fact,
the
court's
words
were
wonderful
in
that
case:
"for
aught
we
now
know",
the
court
said,
somebody
may
come
up
with
wonderful
inventions
in
the
future.
and
of
course
now
we
have
the
fax
machine,
e-mail,
et
cetera.
that's
the
right
way
to
think
about
it,
which
is,
is
the
--
for
the
second
step,
which
is,
is
what's
being
claimed
at
such
a
high
level
of
generality
that
it's
going
to
inhibit
future
innovation.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
in
that
case
they
could
get
an
improvement
patent
on
it,
first
of
all,
no
question
about
it,
that
they
could
apply
for
an
improvement
patent.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
they're
building
on
it.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
there's
a
--
let
me
explain
why
i
think
there
is
not
a
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
if
you
looked
at
the
process
for
vulcanizing
rubber,
which
firestone
patented
many,
many
years
ago,
that
involved
you
heat
india
rubber
to
a
high
temperature,
you
add
sulfur
and
mineral
salts,
and
that
way
you
cure
rubber
into
a
usable
way
of
using
it.
now,
many
years
later
in
diehr
this
court
looked
at
an
improved
process,
if
you
will,
for
making
rubber
which
involved
continuous
measurement
and
the
use
of
the
arrhenius
equation
to
know
when
the
rubber
was
cured.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
somebody
came
out
with
a
second
one
10
years
after
firestone
had
gotten
the
patent
on
vulcanization,
they
would
have
had
to
pay
patent
royalties
for
10
years
before
their
second
one
would
have
been
free
of
patent
royalties,
right,
because
they
would
have
had
to
respect
the
patent
that
firestone
got.
so
the
simple
fact,
in
other
words,
that
there
may
be
further
improvements
to
what
you've
done
isn't
where
the
court
has
ever
drawn
the
line.
and
i
do
think
that
in
conceptualizing
where
to
draw
these
lines,
because
at
the
edges
they're
indeterminant,
they're
elusive
and
they're
going
to
be
somewhat
arbitrary.
this
is
judge-made
law.
i
think
that
what
you've
got
to
look
to
is
what
you've
done
before.
and
if
we
take
this
case
in
the
spectrum
of
what
this
court
has
looked
at,
where
you've
got
morse
on
one
side,
on
that
same
side
you've
got
benson,
which
was
simply
a
formula
for
converting
binary
coded
decimals
to
pure
binary,
which
the
court
said
you
could
use
for
an
infinite
number
of
uses.
it
was
way
too
broad.
if
you
look
at
bilski,
a
general
way
of
--
a
general
--
the
concept
of
hedging.
now
bilski
was
limited,
admittedly
and
this
court
discussed
it
and
said,
well,
they
tried
to
limit
it
with
the
conventional
step
of
having
the
inputs
determined
by
random
analysis
techniques.
i
would
like
to
focus
on
that
for
a
second,
because
the
court
said
that
was
not
significant
extra
solution
activity.
it
wasn't
enough
to
either
render
the
process
a
physical
one
in
the
world
or
to
narrow
its
scope.
well,
why
is
that?
because
random
analysis
techniques
are
themselves
just
an
abstract
idea.
so
you
were
adding
one
abstract
idea
to
another
one
and
it's
no
wonder
that
the
court
found
that
it
didn't
narrow
it
to
a
patentable
scope.
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
we
have
cases
tilghman.
now
if
you
look
at
tilghman,
tilghman
was
a
patent
on
the
fact
that
if
you
use
water
at
a
high
heat
and
high
pressure,
you
can
separate
out
from
fat
bodies,
the
fatty
acids
on
the
one
hand
and
the
glycerin
on
the
other.
and
this
court
approved
a
process
--
a
patent
process
on
that.
now
that's
of
course
a
natural
law,
justice
alito,
no
question
about
it,
in
terms
of
is
it
a
law
of
nature
that
makes
you
do
that,
yes.
but
the
court
was
comforted
in
that
case
by
the
fact
that
the
patent
wasn't
trying
to
generally
patent
monopolize
the
idea
that
water
at
high
pressure
and
temperature
is
going
to
in
general
break
bonds
of
chemicals.
and
it
wasn't
trying
to
either
monopolize
the
whole
idea
of
how
you
can
separate
fat
acids
and
glycerin
from
fat
bodies.
there
are
other
ways,
including
the
use
of
sulfuric
acid.
let's
place
this
case
in
the
continuum.
now,
we
are
not
trying
to
pass
the
general
broad
idea
that
you
can
use
metabolite
readings
after
you
administer
the
drug
to
determine
what
the
likely,
what
the
best
level
of
the
next
administration
might
be.
that
would
be
kind
of
like
the
morse
patent,
and
that's
not
what
we
are
doing.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a,
a
very
specific
class
of
drugs,
the
thiopurines
used
for--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i
agree
it
would,
your
honor.
two
responses
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
right.
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
that
description,
but
let
me
explain--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--why.
all
right,
your
honor,
first
of
all
most
of
the
claims
here
have
three
steps.
so
you
have
an
administering
step
which
clearly
carries
its
own
benefits
with
it.
it's
not
novel,
but
it's
certainly
a
process
step
that
in
and
of
itself
could
be
a
process.
we
couple
that
with
determining
--
you
determine
the
amount
of
metabolites
and
the
next
step
gives
the
doctor
valuable
information
in
order
to
decide
what
to
do
next.
now
why
didn't
we
say,
if
it's
over
400
you
must
decrease
because
that
doesn't
correspond
with
how
doctors
practice
medicine,
your
honor.
so
for
example,
you've
got
a
patient
for
whom
you've
got
a
particularly
sharp
outbreak
of
crohn's
disease.
you
may
well
be
willing
to
go
above
the
normal
400
level
if
your
other
tests,
your
liver
toxicities,
your
white
blood
cell
counts
etc.
,
tell
you
that
for
this
patient
at
this
time
given
that
condition
i
am
willing
to
risk
some
additional
toxicity.
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
you
may
have
somebody
under
230
who
seems
to
be
improving,
they
seem
to
be
moving
towards
remission,
why
push
it,
why
increase.
and
this
is
not
unusual.
and
that's
one
of
the
things
i
think
i've
got
to
stress
here
is
the
notion
of
a
patent
only
in
the
end
producing
information
is
old
in
this
country.
and
by
the
way
to
produce
the
information
you
are
always
going
to
have
a
step
at
the
end
that
is
some
kind
of
an
algorithm.
like
a
very
simple
one.
but
it
takes
the
data,
the
raw
data
and
turns
it
into
something
useful.
so
for
example,
in
the
19th
century
there
were
patents
on
the
use
of
electricity
to
locate
veins
of
ore
and
valuable
minerals
in
the
ground.
now
that
patent
didn't
say
after
you
found
it,
you
have
got
to
dig
it
out.
and
according
to
mayo,
that
would
have
to
be
the
next
step.
but
of
course
you
might
have
reasons
for
digging
it
out
or
not
digging
it
out
depending
on
your
finances,
depending
on
how
deep
it
is
and
depending
on
what
kind
of
ore
it
is,
etc.
there
were
patents
on
how
to
navigate
your
boat
in
the
fog,
it
was
a
primitive
sonar
based
method.
and
it
didn't
tell
you
in
the
end
you
had
must
steer
your
boat
to
x
and
go
there.
it
just
told
you
a
likely
way
to
go.
there
was
not--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
actually,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
certainly.
for
example,
there
was
a
patent
on
the
--
and
i
can
talk
about
modern
ones
too,
of
course,
but
a
patent
on
how
to
find
the
--
where
there
is
a
leak
in
a
water
main
and
it
was
using
vibration
of--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
am
understanding,
your
honor,
because
the
patent
that
tells
you
where
to
find
the
ore
is
telling
you
what
you're
going
to--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
and
if
we
talk
about
modern
days
because
i
think
it's
helpful
now
to
move
this
forward,
the
court
has
never
suggested
that
there
is
an
extra
statutory
limitation
that
prevents
patents
on
developing
useful
information,
even
if
they
have
a
mental
step
at
the
end.
and
what
do
we
have
today?
we've
got
inventions
out
there
that
through
identification
of
biomarkers
or
measuring
the
biomarkers
allow
us
to
know
which
of
10
particular
cancer
drugs
is
going
to
work
for
a
particular
patient.
we
have
got
patents
on
methods
that
allow
us
to
identify
the
likely
location
and
size
of
the
next
earthquake
in
the
san
andreas
fault.
we
have
got
patents
that
allow
us
to
determine
where
there
is
a
crack
and
what
type
of
crack
in
a
nuclear
reactor
core.
now,
according
to
mayo,
because
all
of
these
patents
end
with
a
mental
step
that
produces
information,
they're
no
good.
or
perhaps
if
you
look
at
them
and
say
everything
up
to
that
algorithm
at
the
end
is
old,
you
can't
get
a
patent
because
you
lack
novelty.
now,
it
may
be
to
--
it
may
be
in
fact,
depending
on
the
particular
invention,
that
you
should
lose
for
lack
of
novelty
on
one
or
other
of
those,
or
that
you
should
lose
for
lack
--
for
obviousness.
but
under
101,
these
are
precisely--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--okay,
your
honor,
i'm
happy
to
address
that,
too.
the
answer
is
no,
and
here's
why.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
you
should
not
lose.
and
this
is
why
--
and
i'll
use
my
case
as
a
wonderful
example.
so
in
our
case,
what
existed
before
in
the
prior
art,
so
to
speak,
was
people
knew
that
you
could
administer
thiopurines
for
these
particular
diseases,
and
by
the
way,
they're
not
all
diseases,
just
--
we
do
specifically
exclude
in
these
patents,
for
example,
host-versus-graft
disease.
we
exclude
leukemia,
et
cetera.
they're
not
in
the
asserted
patents
in
this
case.
but
in
any
event,
administration
of
thiopurines
to
address
certain
diseases:
old
in
the
art.
different
methods
for
finding
analytes
in
blood
cells
such
as
high
pressure
liquid
chromatography?
old
in
the
art,
no
doubt.
they
were
used
together
before
we
did
them,
but
why
were
they
used?
they
were
used
by
people
who
were
trying
to
come
up
with
what
we
came
up
with.
they
weren't
doing
it
for
fun.
they
were
administering.
they
were
determining
in
order
to
try
to
find
a
new
treatment
method,
a
new
way
of
calibrating
the
right
dose
for
each
individual
patient
based
on
their
metabolism,
and
help
seriously
ill
patients.
and
the
idea
that
we
are
not
novel
because
people
took
some
of
the
same
steps
along
the
way
to
invention
that
we
actually
succeeded
in
is
wrong.
and
in
fact,
this
court
said
so
in
american
wood-paper,
where
it
said
that
"incomplete
and
unsuccessful
attempts
to
invent
will
not
render
not
novel
the
successful
inventor.
"
and
in
bell,
the
court
said
the
difference
between
those
who
--
those
who
did
not
get
the
patents
in
bell
was
only
the
difference
between
failure
and
success,
and
didn't
say
that
because
many
of
them
had
used
similar
methods
but
had
not
understood
that
continuous
electrical
lines
as
opposed
to
intermittent
or
pulsing
electrical
lines
was
going
to
be
the
difference
for
a
working
telephone.
similar
here.
i
don't
think
we
ought
to
lose
on
novelty
to
that
ground.
but
let's
put
that
to
the
side,
because
that's
for
remand,
and
it's
something
that
hopefully--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
and
let's
explain
why
not.
and
i
will
even
take
for
purposes
of
this
explanation
my
brother's
example
of
over
400
and
under
230,
because
i
don't
think
it
matters.
so
you've
got
dr.
el-azhary,
who
believes
that
the
right
ceiling
level
is
300.
okay?
so
if
she
sees
a
patient
and
says,
"i'm
going
to
--
you
know,
i
associate
290
with
toxicity.
"
that
won't
violate
our
patent
in
the
least.
our
patent
says
if
you
associate
over
400
with
toxicity,
that's
within
our
range.
if
she
associates
290
with
toxicity,
no
violation.
now,
getting
more
to
the
point,
though,
if
we're
totally
wrong
--
let's
assume
we're
off
base
and
--
and
this
doesn't
work
at
all.
there's
another
participant
of
section
101
that
addresses
that,
and
that's
utility.
and
certainly
mayo
would
be
able
to
come
into
court
and
say
that
patent
has
no
utility,
it's
completely
wrong.
in
fact
it's
killing
patients.
and
try
to
invalidate
us
on
that
ground.
similarly,
suppose
at
the
very
edges
of
the
spectrums
that
we're
claiming,
the
answer
is
obvious,
the
answer
is
not
novel.
they
can
seek
to
try
to
invalidate
our
patents
on
that
basis
as
well.
this
--
these
aren't
101
problems.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice;
i
appreciate
the
question.
i
--
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
when
the
problem
is
lack
of
novelty,
when
the
problem
is
obviousness,
the
right
place
to
go
are
the
sections
that
actually
have
very
clear
rules
on
how
to
apply
those,
and
that
the
problem
with
taking
a
short
cut
in
that
instance
is,
essentially,
the
court
would
just
imbue
its
own
notions
or
pre-conceived
notions
of
what
should
be
patentable
and
pour
it
into
it
as
opposed
to
following
those
rules.
and
of
course,
if
you're
going
to
follow
these
rules,
you
might
as
well
follow
them
under
that
section.
now,
it
doesn't
completely
leave
101
bereft.
this
court
has
said
101's
very
broad,
but
it
does
have
limitations.
and
if
you
look
at
a
case
like
morse--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
your
honor,
again,
if
--
if
it's
very
clear
that
we're
not
novel.
for
example,
if
--
if
the
government
is
correct
here
that
facially,
we
lack
novelty,
it's
no
harder
to
proceed
under
102
to
achieve
that
goal
than
it
is
under
101.
if
you're
going
to
proceed
under
101,
then
we'll
talk
about
principles
that
101
speaks
to.
so
101
--
i
think
the
primary
--
the
two
things
explored:
it
has
to
be
a
process
in
the
physical
world,
a
hands-on
process.
and
it
can't
be
so
broad
that
it
preempts
all
follow-on
innovation.
those
are
the
two
things
--
you
know,
this
court
speaks
about
statutory
language,
and
it
has
to
do
some
work.
that's
the
work
that--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--right.
your
honor,
before
prometheus
--
actually,
the
inventors
in
this
case
in
montreal
came
up
with
this
method
--
doctors
had
no
way
to
tailor
for
each
individual
based
on
their
metabolism
the
right
dosage
of
these
powerful
but
potentially
toxic
drugs.
