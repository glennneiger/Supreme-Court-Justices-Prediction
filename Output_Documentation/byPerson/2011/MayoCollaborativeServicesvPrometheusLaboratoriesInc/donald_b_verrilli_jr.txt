mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
each
party
in
this
case
has
got
a
valid
point.
mayo
is
correct
that
you
can't
get
a
patent
by
tacking
a
mental
step
onto
an
utterly
conventional
process
for
administering
drugs
and
testing
their
effects.
but
that
is
an
issue
under
sections
102
and
103
of
the
patent
act.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
from
the
perspective
of
the
united
states
and
the
pto,
it's
exactly
the
opposite;
that
importing
these
--
taking,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
taking
up
the
temptation
to
import
a
look
into
novelty
and
nonobviousness
into
the
101
inquiry
is
going
to
be
very
destabilizing;
101,
as
bilski
said,
is
a
threshold
eligibility
test
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
process.
here
there
is
a
process.
it's
the
administration
of
a
drug
that
changes
the
body
chemistry
and
there
is
then
a
test
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
change
and
then
there
is
an
end
of
the
test.
that's
a
process.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
it's
not
novel,
and
it's
obvious.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
you
can't
get
a
patent
for
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
that's
our
--
that's
our
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
right
way
to
look
at
this
issue
is
under
102
and
under
103,
and
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--because--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--most
are
pretty
obvious.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
our
position
is
a
little
different.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
could,
if
i
could.
i
do
think
that
one
has
to
think
about
what
--
this
seems
like
a
straightforward
case
on
these
facts,
but
if
one
thinks
about
the
principles
that
mayo
is
advocating
and
applying
them
in
a
different
set
of
circumstances
i
think
you
will
see
the
problems.
take
for
example
nuclear
stress
tests
that
cardiologists
use.
that's
a
process.
the
patient
gets
on
a
treadmill,
the
heart
rate
gets
elevated,
radioactive
dye
gets
put
into
the
body,
it
allows
an
image
to
be
taken
of
the
heart
with
an
x-ray
machine.
that
improves
treatment.
now,
the
transformation
there
is,
as
in
this
case,
incidental
to
the
process,
it's
not
the
point
of
the
process.
but
i
don't
think
anyone
would
suggest
that
that's
not
a
patentable
process,
but
under
mayo's
process
it's
not
a
patentable
process.
similarly
i
think
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter,
at
the
pto,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
pto
examiner
gets
a
patent
application
and
answers
every
question,
101,
102,
103,
112,
and
makes
a
decision
about
all
of
them.
so
it's
not
going
to
lead
to
any
benefit
at
the
pto.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
not
if
one
moves
the
novelty
and
obviousness
inquiries
from
102
and
103
into
101.
you've
just
taken
the
complexity
of
102
and
103
and
moved
it
into
101.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
this
case
is
a
pretty
good
illustration,
justice
kennedy,
of
why
that's
not
true.
think
of,
if
i
may
pick
up
on
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
my
friend,
think
of
all
the
trouble
we
are
having
in
this
case
figuring
out
what
the
standard
is:
how
much
preemption
is
too
much?
how
do
you
even
figure
out
the
scope
of
preemption?
what
you
are
actually
doing
here
is
multiplying
a
whole
new
set
of
very
difficult,
complex
questions
that
you
don't
have
to
answer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
there
was
no
new
process,
justice
kagan.
there
is
exactly
the
same
process
that
already
exists,
with
a
new
inference
drawn
at
the
end,
and
that's
why
you
can
capture
this
under
102.
and
i
do
think
it's
important
to
think
about
in
terms
of
the
points
mr.
shapiro
is
making,
if
this
patent
had
involved,
instead
of
standard
old
blood
tests,
had
involved
a
breakthrough
new
test
that
allowed
one
to
measure
metabolite
levels
in
a
way
that
could
never
have
been
done
before,
of
course
the
person
who
invented
that
could
get
this
patent,
even
though
it
would
have
the
excluding
effect
that
mr.
shapiro
has
identified.
similarly,
if
the
drug
is
a
breakthrough
drug
and
a
patentable
drug,
any
use
of
the
drug
during
its
patented
period,
including
a
use
in
a
test
like
this,
would
be
an
infringement
under
271.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
a
harder
question,
but
there
are,
for
example
--
and
i
think
the
court
was
looking
at
some
of
this
in
the
caraco
case
on
monday,
follow-on
patents
with
respect
to
pharmaceutical
products,
where
you
patent
it
originally
for
one
use
and
then
you
can
later
patent
it
when
you
discover
a
different
use.
and
in
fact
there
is
an
entire
regulatory
system
set
up
to
deal
with
that.
so
i
do
think
there
are
circumstances
in
which
that
can
be
patentable,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
existence
of
a
pollutant
in
the
air
and
its
effect
probably
is
a
natural
phenomenon,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
there
is
a
conversion
of
the
natural
body
chemistry.
the
metabolites
wouldn't
be
in
the
body
but
for
the
administration
of
these
drugs.
and
i
do
think
if
one
were
to
say
that
that's
an
unpatentable
natural
phenomenon
--
and
this
is
what
i
mean
about
the
destabilizing
risk
of
thinking
about
this
as
a
101
issue
rather
than
102
or
103
--
you're
going
to
call
into
question
lots
and
lots,
thousands
in
fact,
of
medical
use
patents
where
the
patent
is:
administer
a
therapeutically
effective
dosage
of
this
drug
in
order
to
treat
this
disease.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
justice
breyer.
but
those
patents
are
not
on
the
composition
of
matter.
those
are
process
patents.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
but
that's
a
use
patent.
that's
not
a
composition-of-matter
patent
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
it's
a
process
patent.
it
is
a
process
patent,
and
the
problem
would
be
if
one
says--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
one
says
that
it's
nonpatentable
because
all
you
are
doing
is
patenting
the
application
of
a
law
of
nature,
you're
invalidating
all
those
process
patents.
thank
you.
