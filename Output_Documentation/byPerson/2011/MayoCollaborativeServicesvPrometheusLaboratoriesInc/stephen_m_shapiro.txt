mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
here
today
to
urge
the
court
to
reinstate
the
district
court's
decision,
which
faithfully
applied
this
court's
precedents
under
section
101
of
the
patent
act.
the
problem
with
the
prometheus
patent
is
its
broad
preemption
of
a
physical
phenomenon,
which
prevents
others
like
mayo
clinic
from
offering
a
better
metabolite
test
with
more
accurate
numbers.
and
this
is
a
huge
practical
problem
for
patients.
these
thiopurine
drugs
are
strong
medicine.
too
much
of
this
can
be
fatal;
too
little
can
leave
--
leave
a
chronic
lingering
disease
in
the
patient.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
what
it
can't
do
is
use
any
number
from
400
up
until
infinity,
and
it
believes
that's
the
wrong
number.
and
it
can't
have
a
--
a
different
standard
for
a
legion
of
autoimmune
diseases,
and
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
them.
and
that's
a
broad
field
to
preempt
the
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
you
--
you
see,
your
honor,
we
believe
the
correct
number
is
450
to
700.
and
that's
necessary
to
cure
various
autoimmune
diseases.
and
prometheus
took
the
position
that
its
patent
preempts
everything
above
400,
all
the
way
up
to
infinity,
it
said,
for
all
autoimmune
diseases,
dozens
and
dozens
of
them.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
you
know,
actually
it
didn't,
your
honor.
you
will
see
in
that
opinion,
there
are
two
rulings:
one
is
the
15
percent
ruling,
which
lowers
the
number;
but
it
said
400
and
above
all
the
way
to
infinity.
there's
no
upper
limit
on
this.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
there's
no
room
for
anybody
else
to
offer
a
metabolite
test.
and
what
this
means
for
patients
is
one
opinion
in
the
united
states.
if
you
have
one
of
these
life-threatening
diseases--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--you
get
one
opinion.
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it
--
it
can't
have
a
test
that
has
a
different
therapeutic
range,
because
that's
a
preemption.
they
take
the
position--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
--
and
what
--
what
prometheus
submitted
and
the
court
agreed
is
if
you
are
notified,
if
you
are
aware
of
their
range
when
you're
drawing
blood,
that's
an
infringement
right
then
and
there,
if
--
if
you're
aware
or
warned
by
their
number.
so
any
doctor
in
the
united
states
that
draws
blood
and
is
aware
of
this
range
of
theirs
is
preempting.
and
the
practical
result
is
we
haven't
been
able
to
offer
this
competing
test
now
for
7
years.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
you'll
see,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
district
court,
they
argued
for
any
number
above
400.
that's
--
it's
400
and
above
is
what
it
says.
and
they
said
there's
no
upper
limit
on
that.
the
district
court
found
that.
that
was
their
position
that
was
accepted.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
it
may
be
patentable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
--
the
key
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
specificity.
if
it
leaves
room
for
others
to
have
their
own
tests
with
different
numbers
and
different
procedures
so
that
it
isn't
just
one
test
for
the
whole
country,
then
yes,
if
it's
specific
enough.
the
specificity
is
the
key.
what
--
what
the
court
said
in
bilski,
of
course,
is
that
you
can't
preempt
a
whole
field,
a
broad
field
with
--
with
your
--
your
patent,
which
this
one
does.
and
if
you
look
at
the
diseases
that
are
covered--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
preempt
all
the
numbers
up
to
infinity
and
all
autoimmune
diseases,
that's
a
vast
field.
it's
much
bigger
than
--
than
the
field--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
no.
i
--
i
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no.
i
--
i
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
doctors
have
to
have
freedom
to
make
their
own
judgments
about
these
natural
phenomena.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
--
no.
i
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
it's
the
rule
i
believe
adopted
in
bilski
and
in
flook,
that
you
can't
wipe
out
a
whole
field
so
no
one
else
can
have
a
competing
test.
the
result
for
the
public
is
that
these
numbers
would
be
frozen
for
20
years
and
a
very
serious
person
couldn't
get
a
second
opinion
from
mayo
clinic,
which
uses
different
numbers.
that's
why
we
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
it's
not.
and
in
fact,
this
drug
was
patented.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
difference
is
the
specificity.
if
you
invent
a
drug
which
has
a
particular
chemical
formula,
others
can
invent
other
drugs.
there's
room
for
competing
drugs
in
the
medical
world.
and
you'll
--
many,
many
patented
drugs--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
it
--
it
is
a
patent--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
that's
--
that's
one
--
one
part
of
it.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
can't
patent
nature,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--because
--
because
of
the
law
of
nature
doctrine
that
has
existed
for
150
years
in
this
court.
congress
has
never
disagreed
with
that.
pieces
of
nature
can't
be
monopolized.
neither
can
formulas.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
so
all
doctors
--
that's
part
of
the
storehouse
of
information.
all
doctors
can
look
at
that
reaction.
they
can
calibrate
it
the
way
they
see
fit.
they
have
different
opinions.
and
it's
important
for
all
of
us
that
they
have
those
different
opinions.
we
found
that
the
numbers
that
they
were
using
were
way
off
for
skin
disorders,
dangerously
high.
400
is
the
wrong
number.
the
correct
number
is
150
to
300.
now,
it's
very
important
for
patients
to
be
--
with
life-threatening
conditions,
to
be
able
to
get
that
information.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
right.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
for
us,
the
real
oddity
is
that
this
numerical
calibration
that
they've
given
extends
up
to
infinity,
and
it
precludes
every
other
blood
test.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
sure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
it's
not.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
not
a
good
patent.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
because
you
--
you've
added
to
a
law
of
nature
just
--
just
a
simple
observation
of
the
man's
little
finger.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
are
several
things
that
it
can't
be.
after
bilski,
which
reaffirmed
what
was
said
in
flook,
a
conventional
step
isn't
sufficient,
because
that's
just
adding
a
law
of
nature
to
prior
art,
and
prior
art
plus
prior
art
equals
nothing
that
is
patentable
under
the
flook
decision.
and
also,
the
step
that
you
add
has
to
narrow
your
preemption--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no,
we
are
really
not.
what
the
court
--
what
the
court
said
in
bilski
is
that
a
conventional
step
plus
a
law
of
nature
isn't
sufficient,
and
what
the
court
explained
in
flook
is
that
the
law
of
nature
is
part
of
the
common
domain,
it's
part
of
prior
art.
so
if
you
are
adding
prior
art
to
prior
art
it's
nothing
under
section
101.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
a
very
important
question
for
the
medical
community.
they
need
a
robust
section
101
standard
because
under
102
and
103
you
could
patent
e
equals
mc-squared.
that's
new,
it's
nonobvious;
but
you
can't
patent
it
under
101
because
it's
a
law
of
nature.
and
it's
important
to
keep
this
--
this
common
domain,
the
storehouse
of
information
that
medical
researchers
need
to
have
access
to--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
no,
i
think
--
we
have
two
arguments
on
this
point.
the
first
is
both
flook
and
bilski
peeked
and
--
and
they
looked
at
the
conventional
nature
of
the
additional
step,
and
that's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--this
--
this
is
the
court's
101
analysis
in
both
flook
and
in
bilski.
so
we
rely
on
the
latest
decision,
bilski,
which
took
exactly
that
peek.
but
the
other
part
of
our
answer
is
you
don't
even
have
to
peek.
if
the
step
doesn't
narrow
the
preemption
of
the
natural
phenomenon,
if
it's
just
an
incidental
step
that
you
need
to
use
to
observe
the
natural
phenomenon,
which
this
blood
test
is,
you
can't
see
the
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
sure.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
our
view--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
our
view,
the
rest
of
it
has
to
add
up
to
some
step
that
limits
the
natural
phenomenon,
so
that
you
have
a
concrete,
specific--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
in
the
diehr--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
the
diehr
case--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
the
diehr
case
the
natural
phenomenon
was
limited
with
steps
that
confined
the
invention
to
a
specific
machine
with
doors
opening
and
closing,
temperature
being
monitored
so
a
product
was
cured.
it
was
a
very
specific,
concrete
invention.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
here's
what--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--here's
what
they
say,
joint
appendix
pages
13
through
14,
the
second
volume.
this
is
their
patent.
this
is
what
it
covers.
it
covers
hepatitis,
lupus,
hashimoto's
disease,
graves'
disease,
addison's
disease,
diabetes,
arthritis;
and
they
say
it
even
covers
organ
transplants.
it
covers
heart,
kidney
and
liver
transplants.
so
it
covers
every
autoimmune
disease,
and
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
them--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
they
do
have
different
numbers.
that's
the
key
point.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
--
i
think
what
the
court
did
in
flook
and
what
it
did
in
bilski
is
ask
if
a
broad
field
is
being
preempted.
this
is
broad
numerically.
it
goes
up
to
infinity.
it
covers
dozens
and
dozens
of
autoimmune
diseases.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no,
it
wouldn't.
that
would
be
labcorp,
where
there
was
just
one
malady
in
the
patent;
it
was
a
vitamin
deficiency
with
a
natural
correlation.
and
justice
breyer's
opinion
explained
that
--
that
is
too
preemptive
of
the
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
if
--
if
--
observe
the
--
that's
another
area
of
the
breadth
of
this
patent,
because
there
is
no
specific
action
the
doctor
has
to
take.
if
a
doctor
has
been
informed
of
their
range
and
draws
blood
and
thinks
about
it,
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
infringement,
and
the
doctor
here
was
accused
of
infringement,
treble
damages
sought
against
this
hospital
in
an
injunction,
because
she
thought
about
this
correlation,
and
she
had
completely
different
numbers.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
certainly.
they
could
have
said:
when
you
reach
400,
a
real
number,
a
specific
number,
you
adjust
the
dosage
by
20
percent.
that's
a
treatment
patent.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
what
makes
it
different
is
that
leaves
room
for
mayo
clinic
to
come
up
with
different
numbers
that
it
believes
are
more
accurate
and
more
helpful
for
patients
that
are
suffering
from
these
life-threatening
diseases.
we
shouldn't
require
americans
to
get
one
opinion
from
prometheus
when
they
want
an
opinion
from
mayo
clinic.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
could
be
specific
enough
again
that
others
could
have
a
rival
test
that
--
that
used
a
different
treatment
protocol.
you
would
have
to
look
at
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
think--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
think
it
would
be
patentable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
don't
think
they
can
--
they
can
wipe
out
the
entire
field
so
that
others
can't
have
rival
tests
that
use
different
numbers.
they
tried
to
do
that,
by
the
way.
they
have
a
total
of
eight
patents
here
which
use
different
numbers.
but
you
can't
preempt
the
whole
field
so
others
can't
make
any
use
of
the
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
you
would
need
both.
you
would
have
to
look
at
it
in
practical
terms.
is
there
room
for
somebody
else
to
make
use
of
this
natural
correlation,
so
that
they
could
come
up
with
different
numbers,
different
ranges
and
different
treatments?
and
if
there's
room
left
then
there
is
no
preemption
of
the
natural
phenomenon.
that's
a
vastly
different
case
and
that's
what
is
missing
here.
i
--
i
do
see
my
time
--
yes?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
my
view
is
there
are
only
a
couple
of
them.
labcorp
is
like
this,
this
one
is
like
this.
the
others
that
are
referred
to
in
these
amicus
briefs
are
vastly
different.
they
are
specific
patents
with
specific
treatment
protocols.
and
by
the
way,
the
government
admits
this
particular
patent
is
invalid
because
it
just
attaches
a
mental
step
to
prior
art.
there
are
only
a
couple
of
them
to
our
knowledge
that
would
be
affected
by
a
decision
in
our
favor.
but
a
decision
in
our
favor
would
protect
the
storehouse
of
information
that
doctors
really
need.
they
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
body's
reaction
to
injections,
pills,
chemotherapy,
radiation;
and
different
hospitals
have
to
have
different
opinions
to
safeguard
the
health
of
our
people.
so
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse,
and
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
justice
scalia
asked
the
critical
question
here:
what
if
you
think
these
numbers
are
wrong?
what
happens
with
patients
around
the
country?
well,
that's
just
what
we
concluded:
these
numbers
were
wrong.
they
say
you
go
up
to
400,
and
above
400,
it's
bad,
it's
harmful.
we
found
that
the
right
range
was
450
up
to
700
--
and
sometimes
above
700
--
to
cure
some
of
these
very
serious
diseases.
and
that
different
opinion
was
blockaded
by
this
treble
damages
lawsuit,
and
request
for
an
injunction.
so
the
--
the
wrong
information
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
important
that
101
be
the
robust
test
here.
this
is
the
only
provision
under
which
this
court
has
issued
decision
after
decision
for
150
years
protecting
the
public
domain.
it's
not
some
rough
gauge;
it's
the
critical
test
defining
what's
in
the
storehouse
of
information
for
medical
researchers
to
use.
and
reduce
it
to
a
dead
letter
here
would
be
just
contrary
to
this
court's
precedence,
and
very
harmful
to
the
medical
community.
this
is
very
important
to
--
to
doctors
around
the
country.
now,
is
this
a
natural
process?
the
question
was
raised.
of
course
it's
a
natural
process.
these
metabolites
come
from
the
liver.
they
don't
come
from
a
test
tube.
they
don't
come
from
a
syringe.
it's
just
like
cholesterol.
if
i
eat
in
a
french
restaurant,
there's
some
human
intervention
there
that
gives
me
high
cholesterol.
and
if
i
eat
wild
strawberries,
there's
no
human
intervention.
but
either
way,
the
doctors
get
to
look
at
my
cholesterol
and
hypothesize
ranges
that
they
think
are
essential.
it's
the
very
same
phenomenon.
entirely
natural.
now,
this
is
a
clean
legal
issue.
under
section
101,
it's
always
been
a
legal
issue.
they
say
section
102
and
103
are
the
most
elusive
questions
in
the
field
of
patent
law.
this
is
a
seven
year
old
lawsuit
against
a
hospital;
it's
cost
millions
of
dollars
to
defend.
two
trips
to
this
court,
two
trips
to
the
federal
circuit.
we're
still
litigating
this
treble
damages
case.
it
should
be
terminated
under
this
court's
precedence,
as
the
district
court
did
giving
summary
judgment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
well,
i
think
that's
right.
that's
--
that
is
a
second
issue.
but
the
first
issue
is
the
breadth
of
the
preemption,
which
precludes
anyone
else
in
the
country,
from
saying
as
justice
scalia
did
--
those
numbers
are
wrong.
and
patients
can't
use
those
numbers
safely
or
they
won't
get
cured
of
this
disease.
for
20
years,
the
public
is
stuck
with
the
erroneous
information.
now,
counsel
suggests
that
it's
narrow
preemption
because
it
doesn't
cover
host-versus-graft
or
leukemia.
those
are
not
autoimmune
diseases.
every
autoimmune
disease
is
swept
in
here.
and
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
them.
they
have
different
characteristics.
you
don't
take
a
"one
size
fits
all"
approach
to
autoimmune
disease.
there
are
different
numbers
for
different
diseases.
that's
what
mayo
is
trying
to
do,
to
have
some
personalized
medicine
for
skin
disorders.
and
they
said
that
--
that
is
an
infringement
and
we're
entitled
to
treble
damages
and
an
injunction.
now,
is
this
like
the
morse
case?
yes,
it
is
like
the
morse
case.
prometheus
is
trying
to
preempt
diseases
it
never
researched,
and
it's
trying
to
preempt
numbers
that
differ
from
its
numbers
fundamentally.
they
have
the
number
7000
in
their
patented
number.
we
thought
the
number
should
be
5700.
this
is
a
very
dangerous
toxic
drug.
if
you
get
the
wrong
number
set
in
concrete
for
20
years,
that
is
a
huge
problem
for
patients.
and
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
patients
suffering
from
autoimmune
disease.
so
we
urge
the
court
to
protect
the
research
process
here
that's
so
fundamental
to
american
health
and
to
the
economy
and
the
healthcare
industry.
we
thank
the
court.
