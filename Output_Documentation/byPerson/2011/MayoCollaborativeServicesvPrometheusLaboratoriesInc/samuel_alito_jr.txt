alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
about
your
argument
that
the
correlations
that
were
discovered
and
that
are
involved
here
are
not
natural
phenomenon
because
the
thiopurine
drugs
are
synthetic
products
of
human
ingenuity?
i
found
that
a
little
difficult
to
understand.
suppose
someone
discovers
the
level
at
which
a
human
pollutant
that
is
present
in
the
atmosphere
or
in
the
air
or
the
water
has
an
adverse
effect
on
human
health.
is
that
not
a
natural
phenomenon?

alito,

and
that's
a
natural
phenomenon.
justice

alito,
jr.
yes,
but
if
photosynthesis
is
induced
by
a
lamp
inside
a
building,
then
it's
not
a
natural
phenomenon?
