justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nature--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
how
do
you
--
that's
--
i
see
that.
i
will
spare
you
the
reasons
why
i
think
the
law
of
nature
doctrine
exists,
because
they
are
not
relevant
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
i
think
it's
hornbook
law
that
the
law
of
nature
cannot
be
patented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
also
hornbook
law
that
the
application
of
a
law
of
nature
can
be
patented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
in
this
case,
what
i
think
the
claim
is
is
that
we
are
applying
a
law
of
nature.
now,
we
read
the
words
of
applying
it:
administer
a
drug,
determine
the
level.
and
then
it
uses
the
word
"wherein",
which
i
will
ask
them
what
that
means.
but
--
but
--
so
they
say
those
two
words,
administer
the
drug,
determine
the
level,
are
the
application
of
the
law
of
nature
that
they
found.
now,
there's
something
odd
about
that
in
your
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
least.
and
i
want
to
know
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
it
didn't.
suppose
i
discover
that
if
i
take
aspirin,
someone
takes
aspirin,
i
discover
they
have
to
take
aspirin
for
a
headache
and,
you
know,
i
see
an
amazing
thing:
if
you
look
at
a
person's
little
finger,
and
you
notice
the
color
of
--
it
shows
the
aspirin,
you
need
a
little
more,
unless
it's
a
different
color,
you
need
a
little
less.
now,
i've
discovered
a
law
of
nature
and
i
may
have
spent
millions
on
that.
and
i
can't
patent
that
law
of
nature,
but
i
say:
i
didn't;
i
said
apply
it.
i
said:
look
at
his
little
finger.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
is
that
a
good
patent
or
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
can
tell
me
why
not,
i'll
have
an
understanding
of
where
you
are
coming
from.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
now,
we're
into
the
problem.
and
that
is
the
problem
of
how
much
you
have
to
add.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
look
at
the
court's
cases,
they
seem
to
say
flook,
one
thing,
and
diehr
another
thing.
and
so
what
is
your
view
about
how
much
has
to
be
added
to
make
it
an
application
of
a
law
of
nature?
and
how
would
you
put
that
in
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
getting
warmer,
but--
[laughter]
but
the
--
the
words,
look,
"a
simple
conventional
step".
hmmm.
you
see,
whether
it's
true
in
this
case
or
not,
discovering
natural
laws
is
often
a
very
expensive
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there's
lots
of
investment
to
be
protected.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
can't,
okay?
so
now
you
are
going
to
say,
well,
what
do
they
have
to
add
to
that?
and
now
we
run
into
problems,
because
if
you
have
to
just
not
look
at
the
law
of
nature,
don't
look
at
it
when
you
decide
whether
it's
novel,
that
not
only
runs
into
conflict
with
prior
cases,
but
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
because
really
the
novel
thing
is
often
the
law
of
nature.
but
you
say
you
have
to
add
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
that
--
what
do
you
have
to
add?
and
it
can't
be
that
you
take
the
law
of
nature
out
and
look
to
whether
the
rest
of
it
meets
the
patent
criteria.
it's
--
it's
pretty
clear
in
the
law
and
i
can
give
you
reasons
why,
but
forget
the
reasons.
but
look,
what
do
you
want
to
say
the
rest
of
it
has
to
add
up
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
going
on
a
limitation
thing.
you
are
going
to
say
reject
all
the
15
fancy
hypotheticals
i
will
also
spare
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
pretty
easy
to
think
of
the
same
problem
you
have,
you
know,
which
doesn't
have
this
infinity
in
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
unfortunately
we
have
to
deal
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
what
my
opinion
lacked,
frankly,
and
sometimes
that's
the
virtue
of
a
dissent
in
such
a
case,
it
lacked
--
and
novartis
points
this
out
very
well
in
their
brief
--
it
lacked
an
explanation
as
to
why
what
i
thought
was
a
patent
just
said,
observe
the
correlation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
isn't
that
an
application
of
the
law
of
nature?
and
if
you
look
to
labcorp's
dissent
to
find
an
answer
to
that
question,
you
are
better
than
i,
because
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look:
anything
can
be
transformed
into
a
process.
look
at
those
real
estate
ones,
lawyers
ones.
i
have
a
way
of
making
a
great
argument
in
the
supreme
court.
you
know,
you
could
patent
some
of
your
arguments.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
cut
them
off
at
the
pass?
that
is,
if
you're
really
prepared
to
say
--
it
has
to
do
with
process,
not
machines.
in
the
19th
century
not
many
patent
processes
were
granted,
so
they
are
rather
special
because
of
the
special
problem
the
chief
just
noticed.
so
why
not
cut
them
off
at
the
pass,
if
you
are
prepared
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
will
add
a
little
bit
to
this
because
i
am
questioning
what
you
say
here
in
the
other
direction.
you
say
if
you
just
look
at
everything
minus
the
law
of
nature,
hmm,
and
that
is
a
process
that's
otherwise
known
or
obvious
in
light
of
the
prior
art,
you
can't
patent
it.
that
seems
to
me
maybe
it
goes
too
far
in
the
other
direction,
because
we
know
that
a
lot
of
work
goes
into
these
laws
of
nature.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
there
are
both
parts,
but
i'm
more
interested
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
this
drug
is
patentable
because
it's
a
--
what
is
the
third
word.
you
know,
it's
combination
of
nature.
what's
the
--
it's
a
composition
of
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
have
to
be.
you'd
say
that
where
it's
a
new
use
there
were
some
specifications
and
the
specifications
limited
the
area
to
over
here,
i
think
--
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
because
i'm
really
asking
just
a
question
--
they
limit
it
over
here,
you
see.
and
now
we
have
a
new
use
and
we
are
saying
this
composition
of
matter
is
being
used
over
here.
so
aren't
you
getting
a
--
simply
a
different
area
where
you
are
using
a
composition
of
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
a
process
patent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
of
two
examples
that
will
try
to
get
you
to
talk
about
the
problem
that's
really
bothering
me
here,
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well.
a
patent
for
--
we've
discovered,
at
some
extent,
what
counts
as
too
little
fertilizer
and
what
counts
as
too
much
to
make
plants
grow,
a
certain
kind
of
fertilizer,
very
common.
less
than
an
quarter
of
an
inch,
forget
it;
more
than
half
an
inch,
you
are
going
to
burn
the
plant.
imagine
that.
law
of
nature,
absolutely,
about
the
chemicals
in
the
fertilizer.
patent:
a
method
for
determining
when
there
is
too
little
or
too
much
fertilizer.
put
some
fertilizer
in
a
field
and
measure
how
much
there
is,
wherein
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
is
too
little
and
wherein
more
than
half
an
inch
is
too
much.
second
example.
einstein
never
lived,
but
at
vast
expense
you
invented
e
equals
mc-squared,
a
method
for
measuring
energy
which
is
very
useful
that
comes
out
of
a
cyclotron.
put
some
stuff
in
a
cyclotron,
measure
the
stuff
in
and
measure
how
much
comes
out,
and
keep
--
wherein,
wherein,
the
missing
part
is
--
think
about
--
wherein
--
it
says:
wherein
the
missing
part
will
be
calculated
as
an
amount
of
energy
according
to
a
formula
e
equals
mc-squared.
if
your
patent
is
valid,
why
aren't
the
two
i
just
mentioned?
and
if
you
--
if
the
two
i
just
mentioned
are
valid,
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
picture.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
lack
of
novelty?
nobody
has
these
numbers
before.
they
always
thought
it
was
a
quarter,
an
eighth
of
an
inch.
it's
huge
novelty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
my
point
--
assume
with
me
the
eighth
versus
quarter
of
an
inch
which
is
the
law
of
nature
part
is
not
obvious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
my
question
is,
what
has
to
be
added
to
a
law
of
nature
to
make
it
a
patentable
process?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
put
too
little
in
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
believe
i
can
take
things
that
like
e
equals
mc-squared
and
make
them
patentable.
and
if
you
put
too
much
in,
you
are
going
to
wreck
your
own
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a
process
that
all
the
steps
are
--
it's
a
process
to
--
to
generate
some
useful
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
and
the
only
new
thing
about
it
is
the
useful
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anything
like
that
in
history,
any
patent
case
that
comes
to
mind
that
you
say
that
was
okay?
can
you
think
of
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
good.
that's
what
i
would
like
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that's
not
what
i'm
thinking
of.
i'm
thinking
of
a
patent
to
find
useful
information
that
chickens
can
only
eat
so
much
chicken
food.
that
nobody
has
ever
known
before,
you
know.
okay.
now
there's
something
like
that.
but
they
tell
you
the
useful
information
that's
going
to
be
found
right
in
the
patent.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
patent
to
discover
some
useful
information
and
here
is
the
useful
information.
and
now
here's
--
see,
that's
what
they're
complaint--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
don't
know
what
you
are
going
to
find
because
you
don't
know
how
much
ore
you
are
going
to
find?
let's
see,
okay.
let
me
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
should
not
lose
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
section
101
of
the
patent
act
says,
in
relevant
part,
“whoever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
and
useful
process,
machine,
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter
may
obtain
a
patent.”
the
court
has
long
held,
however,
that
the
provision
contains
an
important
implicit
exception.
laws
of
nature,
natural
phenomena
and
abstract
ideas
are
not
patentable.
thus,
einstein
could
not
have
patented
his
formula,
e=mc2,
nor
could
archimedes
have
patented
his
principle
of
flotation.
such
discoveries,
the
court
has
said,
are
manifestations
of
nature,
free
to
all
men
and
reserved
exclusively
to
none.
the
underlying
concern
is
that
since
laws
of
nature
are
the
basic
tools
of
scientific
work
allowing
them
to
be
patented
would
pose
to
great
a
threat
to
future
innovation,
but
the
exception
cannot
go
too
far.
virtually,
every
invention
relies
to
some
degree
on
some
law
of
nature,
so
the
court
has
also
said
that
inventions
that
apply
a
law
of
nature
in
a
useful
and
inventive
way
are
patentable.
but
what
must
a
claim
do
to
leave
the
unpatentable
law
of
nature
category
and
enter
the
patentable
application
of
the
law
of
nature
category?
to
count
as
an
application,
a
claim
cannot
simply
state
a
law
of
nature
and
then
add
the
words
“apply
it.”
einstein
could
not
get
a
patent
on
his
law
by
telling
people,
“apply
my
law
as
you
think
fit.”
this
case
raises
these
questions.
the
patent
claims
here
focus
upon
doctors
who
use
drugs
called
thiopurine
drugs
to
treat
patients
with
certain
kinds
of
autoimmune
diseases.
doctors
have
used
these
drugs
for
some
time.
and
they
know
that
after
a
patient
receives
a
dose,
the
drug
has
to
be
metabolized
in
order
to
work.
they
also
know
that
different
patients
metabolize
the
drug
to
different
degrees
in
different
ways
and
they
know
how
to
determine
by
examining
a
patient’s
bloodstream
to
metabolize
drug
level.
but
before
the
invention
at
issue
here
came
along,
they
did
not
know
just
what
metabolized
level
in
the
blood
meant
too
much
drug,
so
lower
the
dose
and
what
level
meant
too
little
drug,
so
raise
the
dose.
the
process
claims
here
embody
more
recent
discoveries
that
answer
these
last
questions.
in
case
you
would
like
to
know,
a
level
of
less
than
230
picomoles
of
metabolized
drug
per
800,000,000
red
blood
cells
shows
need
to
increase
the
dosage
while
a
level
of
400
shows
a
need
to
reduce
the
dosage.
i
thought
you'd
like
to
know
that.
these
correlations,
however,
are
unpatentable
natural
laws
even
though
the
relationship
they
describe
arise
only
after
a
drug
is
administered
to
a
patient
and
that
is
a
human
action,
the
relationships
themselves
are
natural
ones
caused
by
the
natural
interactions
of
the
drug
with
the
human
body.
so,
we
have
to
look
beyond
the
correlations
themselves
and
ask
whether
the
process
that
the
patent
applicant
seeks
to
claim
embodies
something
more
than
just
those
natural
laws.
we
conclude
that
the
claims
before
us
do
not
contain
anything
significant
beyond
the
natural
law
of
correlations
themselves.
the
processes,
as
i'll
summarize
them,
consist,
in
effect,
of
three
steps.
those
steps
tell
doctors,
one,
administer
a
thiopurine
drug
to
your
patient.
two,
determine,
i.e.,
measure
the
resulting
metabolite
levels
in
the
patient's
blood,
and
then
three,
consider
the
resulting
measurements
in
the
light
of
the
correlations.
the
first
step,
the
administering
step,
simply
identifies
a
set
of
people
who
may
be
interested
in
applying
the
relevant
laws,
namely,
doctors
who
treat
their
patients
with
thiopurine
drugs.
our
case
law
makes
clear
that
you
cannot
patent
a
natural
law
just
by
limiting
use
of
the
patented
process
to
those
in
a
certain
technological
environment
as
if,
for
example,
archimedes
had
limited
use
of
the
flotation
principle
to
boat
builders,
that
isn't
good
enough.
the
second
step,
the
determining
step,
simply
tells
the
doctors
to
measure
metabolite
levels
in
the
blood,
but
measuring
metabolites
is
something
that
researchers
in
the
field
were
doing
before
the
correlations
at
issue
here
were
found
and
doing
so
is
a
necessary
precursor
to
applying
those
correlations.
our
cases
tell
us
that
a
process
cannot
be
rendered
patentable
simply
by
adding
conventional
pre-solution
activity
to
the
statement
of
a
natural
law.
the
third
step,
the
consider
step,
simply
adds
to
these
first
two
steps
a
statement
of
the
natural
laws
with,
at
most,
a
suggestion
that
doctors
should
take
those
laws
into
account
when
treating
their
patients,
perhaps,
by
modifying
the
drug
dosage
they
subsequently
administer
if
they
decide
that
doing
so
makes
sense
all
things
considered.
insofar
as
the
claim
set
forth
additional
steps
beyond
the
law
of
nature
itself,
those
steps
consist
of
well
understood
routine,
conventional
activity
already
engaged
in
by
the
scientific
community.
we
consequently
conclude
that
the
patent
claims
say
nothing
significantly
more
than
apply
the
law,
i.e.,
apply
the
natural
laws
that
they
describe
and
that
simple
additional
instruction,
by
itself,
is
insufficient
to
transform
an
otherwise
patentable
claim
into
a
--
unpatentable
claim
into
a
patentable
one.
we
discuss
these
matters
further
in
our
opinion,
but
we
also
describe
the
relevant
case
law
and
explain
why
we
cannot
accept
the
respondents
and
the
government's
counter
arguments.
we
hold
that
the
patents
are
invalid
under
section
101
of
the
patent
act,
and
we
reverse
the
federal
circuit's
contrary
determination.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
