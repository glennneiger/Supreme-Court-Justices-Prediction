that
--
in
your
test
for
that
--
i
see
on
page
9
of
your
brief
you
say:
"a
classic
patent-eligible
process
recites
a
series
of
acts
performed
in
the
physical
world
that
transforms
the
subject
of
the
process
to
achieve
a
useful
result.
"
so
i
have
a
great
idea.
you
take
wood,
you
put
it
on
a
grate,
you
light
it,
and
you
get
heat.
that
is
--
recites
a
series
of
acts
performed
in
the
physical
world
that
transforms
the
subject
of
the
process,
the
wood,
to
achieve
a
useful
result,
which
is
heat.
so
i
can
get
a
patent
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
no.
well,
let
me
put
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
patent-eligible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
what
is
the
great
advantage
you
see
of
putting
this
critical
question
off
until
the
102,
103
analysis,
rather
than
cutting
it
off
at
the
beginning,
101,
which
i
understand
your
friend
to
say
is
very
important
because
you
don't
want
people
to
have
to
pause
terribly
long
to
see
if
this
is
something
they
can
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
litigation?
it
is
easier
to
throw
something
out
at
the
threshold
level,
isn't
it,
than
to
move
further
down
the
line?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
bress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
--
the
problem
with
your
whole
approach
is
that
every
time
you're
pressed
on
101,
your
answer
is
to
fall
back
to
102
or
103
or
the
utility
part
of
101.
and
i'm
just
wondering
why
it's
beneficial
to
essentially
eliminate
101
and
say
oh,
we'll
catch
everything
later
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
as
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
your
friend's
point
is
that
if
you
don't
do
this
--
if
you
don't
give
101
some
more
content,
then
the
doctor
is
going
to
have
to
start
worrying
right
from
the
get-go,
and
they
say
well,
is
there
an
exception
that
i
might
be
able
to
rely
on,
as
opposed
to
being
able
to
say
right
away
this
--
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
this
patent;
i
can
treat
the
patient
in
this
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

you,
counsel.
mr.
shapiro,
