mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
social
security
administration
has
reasonably
interpreted
the
social
security
act
to
provide
that
as
a
general
rule,
a
person
seeking
to
establish
eligibility
or
child
survivor
benefits
must
show
that
he
or
she
would
have
been
able
to
inherit
personal
property
from
the
decedent
under
applicable
state
intestacy
law.
that
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
text,
structure
and
history
of
the
act,
and
it
comports
with
principles
of
federalism
because
it
defers
to
state
law
on
the
determination
of
family
status,
which
is
a
traditional
subject
of
state
regulation.
it's
reasonable
and
entitled
to
deference
under
chevron.
now,
the
textual
arguments
in
this
case
involve
the
interaction
of
three
provisions
of
the
act.
the
first
is
section
402(d)(1),
which
is
the
basic
benefits-granting
provision.
and
that
says
that
under
certain
conditions,
the
child
of
a
wage
earner
is
entitled
to
benefits.
and
that
provision
has
a
cross-reference
to
a
definition
of
416(e)
of
the
act.
and
416(e),
which
is
reprinted
at
page
4a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
says
that
the
term
"child"
means:
one,
the
child
or
legally
adopted
child
of
an
individual;
two,
a
stepchild
under
certain
cases;
and
three,
a
person
who
is
the
grandchild
or
step-grandchild
of
an
individual.
now,
i
think
the
one
thing
that's
immediately
apparent
from
looking
at
that
provision
is
that
under
anyone's
reading
it's
a
little
bit
confusing
because
it
uses
the
word
"child"
twice
to
mean
two
different
things.
that
is,
the
first
"child"
is
broader
than
the
second,
because
the
first
one
includes
the
second
as
well
as
adopted
child,
stepchild,
and
so
forth.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
not
necessarily,
because
if
somebody
doesn't
qualify
under
--
and
i
should
say
at
the
outset
that
that
is
unlike
the
law
of
any
state
either
in
1939
or
today--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
--
there
are
two
alternative
mechanisms
that
congress
added
to
the
statute
in
the
1960s
to
allow
children
who
lack
intestacy
rights
to
establish
their
eligibility.
those
are
416(h)(2)(b)
and
416(h)(3).
and
416(h)(3)
says
that
an
applicant
who
is
the
son
or
a
daughter
of
an
insured
individual
but
is
not
a
child
under
paragraph
a,
which
is
the
reference
to
state
intestacy
law,
shall
nevertheless
be
deemed
to
be
a
child
if
there
was
an
acknowledgment
in
writing
that
the
child
was
--
that
the
applicant
was
the
son
or
daughter,
or
there
was
a
court
decree
for
support.
but
i
think--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that's
right.
and
--
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
fact,
under
the
law
of
every
state,
both
in
1939
and
today,
children
whose
parents
are
married
do
have
state
--
do
have
intestacy
rights.
but
i
--
i
think
what
--
what
the
provision
i
just
referred
to
illustrates
is
that
the
term
"child"
in
this
statute
is
a
legal
term
of
art,
because
if
you
were
just
looking
at
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"child",
the
concept
of
an
applicant
who
is
a
son
or
daughter
but
is
not
a
child,
would
be
completely
nonsensical.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
mean
--
i
think
--
i
think
those
--
those
are
probably
accurate
factual
claims
about
what
congress
was
thinking.
but
had
--
had
congress
wanted
--
the
way
that
congress
chose
to
make
sure
that
the
children
of
married
parents
could
establish
their
eligibility
was
by
looking
to
state
intestacy
law,
because
congress
knew
that
under
state
intestacy
law,
those
children
had
such
rights.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
it
--
that
--
that
is
what
section
416(h)
says.
section
416(h)
sets
out
a
rule--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
because
with
respect
to
the
main
category
of
people
at
issue
the
question
congress
was
asking
is,
what
is
the
class
of
people
who
are
likely
to
have
a
sufficiently
close
relationship
to
the
insured
person
such
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
provide
benefits
to
replace
the
loss
of
support
that
they
would
likely
be
getting
during
the
person's
life.
and
if
you
look
at
what
is
the
body
of
law
that
defines
that
class
of
people
who
have
a
close
relationship
with
someone,
it's
state
intestacy
law.
and
state
intestacy
law
sets
out
sort
of
a
clear,
easy
to
apply
rules
for
the
distribution
of
estates.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that's
right.
the
first
sentence
sets
up
a
general
rule
that
you
look
to
state
law
for
the
definition
of
"child".
and
the
second
sentence
says
that
people
who
do
not
have
the
status
of
children
but
nevertheless
have
the
inheritance
rights
of
children
shall
be
deemed
children.
and
as
a
practical
matter
the
people
that
that
applies
to
are
people
who
have
been
equitably
adopted.
there
is
a
doctrine
in
the
law
of
many
states
where
you
have
an
adoption
or
you
have
an
agreement
to
adopt,
but
not
yet
a
completed
legal
adoption.
in
that
circumstance
the
would-be
adoptee
does
not
have
the
status
of
a
child
for
all
purposes
or
even
necessarily
for
all
inheritance
law
purposes,
but
can
take
property
from
the
adopting
parents.
so
that's
who
would
be
covered
by
that
sentence
and
that
is
now
addressed
in
the
regulations,
i
believe,
at--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
--
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
most
likely
category
that
it
would
apply
to.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
social
security
administration
tries
to
apply
state
law.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
the
ssa
does
the
best
that
it
can
to
figure
out
what
the
state
law
is,
and
then
on
review
in
the
district
court,
you
know,
the
district
court
is
able
to
review
that.
and
there
have
been
cases
in
which
district
courts
have
certified
questions
to
state
courts.
and
i
think
actually
the
fact
that
there
are
those
difficult
questions
that
can
come
up
in
some
of
the
cases,
particularly
involving
assisted
reproductive
technology,
really
illustrates
one
of
the
virtues
of
leaving
it
to
the
states
rather
than,
as
respondent
would
have
it,
effectively
forcing
ssa
and
then
the
federal
courts
on
review
of
its
decisions
to
create
a
sort
of
federal
common
law
of
parentage
to
resolve
all
of
those
very
difficult
questions.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that's
right.
and
in
fact
there
are
statutes
in
a
number
of
states
addressing
a
question
of
when
a
--
yes.
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
i
can't
speak
with
certainty
to
all
the
states,
but
i
believe
that
that
is
the
--
the
general
rule.
so
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
any
states
where
when
you
have
a
married
couple
using
donor
--
donor
sperm,
that
the
child
would
not
be
deemed
the
child
of
the
husband.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
believe
that
is
--
that
is
the
general
rule.
and
i
think
one
thing
that
that
illustrates,
of
course,
is
that
respondent's
definition,
which
is
also
the
court
of
appeals'
definition
of
what
a
child
is,
and
the
definition
that
they
urge
the
court
to
apply
in
416,
is
the
biological
child
of
married
parents.
and
not
only
is
the
--
does
the
1939
and
today
there
are
many
cases
in
which
biological
parentage
is
not
determinative
of
legal
parentage,
both
for
the
reason
that
we
were
just
talking
about
and
then
also
for
--
another
example
is
when
you
have
an
adoption;
a
child
who
has
been
adopted
by
somebody
else
is
no
longer
legally
the
child
of
his
biological
parents.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
we
--
that
--
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
agency
to
address
in
the
first
instance.
the
agency
has
not
addressed
that
question
in
the
administrative
process
here,
so
we
are
not--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
and
the
ninth
circuit
read
the
dependency
provision
of
the
act
to
say
that
any
legitimate
child
is
deemed
to
be
dependent,
and
it
then
conducted
an
examination
of
legitimacy
under
california
law.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that's
right.
i
mean
i
--
what
i
will
say
is,
just
speaking
in
general
terms
about
dependency,
the
statute
creates
a
number
of
presumptions
that
allow
basically
any
--
any
natural
child,
any
child
under
the
--
that
first
--
that
second
child
in
416(e)(1),
anyone
who
fits
into
that
category
is
deemed
to
be
dependent.
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
turn
on
--
on
factual
dependency,
which
is
obviously
not
present
in--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
presumption
in
favor
of
dependency
for
anyone
who
qualifies
is
irrebuttable.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
--
it
doesn't
appear
in
any
of
the
--
the
operative
definitional
provisions,
but
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
it
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes,
and
i
certainly
would
agree
with
the
--
the
idea
that
it
is
difficult
to
describe
someone
as
a
survivor
who
was
not
alive
at
the
time
that
person--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
dependency
requirement
is
defined
in
402(d)(3)
and
--
which
unfortunately
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
which
had
the
effect
of
making
anyone
who
qualifies
under
416(h)
be
deemed
dependent.
now,
we
don't
think
that
the
children
in
this
case
qualify
under
416(h),
so
there
is
not
even
any
need
to
reach
the
dependency
question
here.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the
dependency
requirement
is
something
that
people
who
don't
qualify
under
416(h),
people
who
are
adopted,
children
or
stepchildren
or
grandchildren
may
in
some
cases
have
to
make
an
individualized
determination
of
actual
dependence.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right,
but
then
--
but
then
402(d)(3)
says
a
child
shall
be
deemed
dependent
under
certain
circumstances
that
effectively
track
the
416(h)
analysis.
and
i
--
i
would
refer
you
on
that
point
to
the
agency's
regulations
defining
dependency,
which
are
404.361,
which
say
that
any
natural
child,
which
is
the
term
the
agency
uses
for
that
second
child
in
416(e),
any
natural
child
is
deemed
dependent.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
that
when
the
statute
was
initially
enacted
in
1939
with
more
or
less
the
same
structure
of
these
provisions
as
we
have
now,
it
might
at
that
time
have
been
ambiguous.
but
the
agency
adopted
an
interpretation
that
is,
again,
in
structure
materially
identical
to
its
current
interpretation
in
1940
and
it
has
adhered
to
it
ever
since.
and
congress
has
amended
the
statute
with
the
understanding
that
that
was
the
interpretation,
that
everybody
had
to
go
through
state
law
to
qualify.
and
i
think
in
light
of
that
history,
at
this
point,
and
congress's
ratification
of
that
understanding,
at
this
point
the
best
view
is
that
it
is
unambiguous,
and
clearly
resolves
the
question
in
favor
of
the
interpretation
set
out
in
the
agency's
regulations.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
because
those
terms
do
not
appear
in
416(h).
there
is
no
instruction
in
the
statute
that
those
terms
be
defined
by
reference
to
state
law,
as
there
is
with
respect
to
"child".
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
should
say
two
things
about
that,
then.
the
first
is
specifically
with
respect
to
grandchildren.
the
agency
--
the
agency
has
defined
a
404.358.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
somebody
who
would
qualify
under
416(h)
as
a
child.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
indirectly.
i
mean,
"grandchild"
is
not
expressly
defined
in
the
act,
but
somebody
who
qualifies
either
under
state
law
or
you
could
also
qualify
as
a
stepchild
or
adopted
child
of
someone
who
qualifies
as
a
child
in
that
same
sense.
but
again,
the
lack
of
a
--
a
--
what
is
significant,
i
think,
is
the
lack
of
any
other
provision
in
the
statute
that
tells
you
how
to
define
"grandchild".
i
mean,
the
run
of
cases
that
congress
was
concerned
about
involved
children,
and
for
--
in
explaining
to
the
agency
how
to
deal
with
those
cases,
congress
gave
explicit
guidance
and
that's
to
look
to
state
law
in
416(h).
now,
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
the
benefits-granting
provision,
402(d),
has
an
express
cross-reference
to
the
definition
in
416(e),
but
doesn't
cross-reference
the
definition
in
416(h).
and
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
that
argument,
the
first
of
which
is
that
416(h)
by
its
own
terms
says
that
it
applies
for
purposes
of
this
subchapter,
that
is
throughout
all
of
the
parts
of
the
act
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
so
effectively
416(h)
incorporates
itself
into
the
416(e)
definition
and
there
is
no
need
for
an
express
cross-reference.
the
second
point
about
that
is
that
the
structure
of
the
definitions
here
is
very
similar
to
the
structure
of
the
definitions
used
in
defining
other
family
relationships
that
are
eligible
for
benefits.
so
under
402,
some
of
the
other
subsections
of
402,
there
are
benefits
for
the
wife
or
husband
or
widow
or
widower
of
an
insured
person.
and
just
to
take
the
benefits
for
a
wife
as
an
example,
in
402(b)
the
statute
says
that
the
"wife
--
as
defined
in
section
416(d)
of
this
title.
"
under
certain
circumstances
can
get
benefits.
if
you
look
at
the
definition
in
416(b)
of
416(e).
it
says:
"the
term
"wife"
means
the
wife
of
an
individual.
"
and
then
it
has
some
limitations.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
you
were
to
take
respondent's
approach,
you
would
just
stop
there
and
apply
some
federal
standard
of
figuring
out
whether
people
are
married
or
not.
but
in
fact
416(h),
paragraph
1
of
416(h),
says
an
applicant
is
the
wife
or
husband
or
widow
or
widower
of
an
insured
person
if
the
state
courts
would
regard
them
as
being
married.
so
--
and
in
the
1939
act,
all
of
those
references
to
state
law
for
wives
and
widows
and
children
were
all
combined
in
one
paragraph,
so
it
was
even
clearer
that
that
was
how
the
statute
worked,
that
you
look
to
state
law
for
defining
all
these
family
relationships.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i'm
sorry.
the
definition
of
dependency
is
in
(d)(3),
402(d)(3),
not
--
402(d)(3)
says
a
child
shall
be
deemed
dependent
upon
his
father
unless
at
such
time
such
individual
was
not
living
with
or
contributing
to
the
support
of
such
child
and
the
child
is
neither
the
legitimate
nor
adopted
child
of
the
individual.
so
the
effect
of
that
is
anyone
who
is
a
legitimate
child
is
deemed
dependent
under
402(d)(3).
mr.
eric
d.
miller
because
the
child
is
deemed
dependent
unless
he
was
--
again,
since
--
to
be
clear,
we
think
that
the
children
in
this
case
do
not
--
are
not
eligible
for
child
status
because
they
don't
meet
the
requirements
of
416(h).
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
that
might
well
be
the
case.
our
position
is
simply
that
that
is
not
an
issue
that
the
agency
has
addressed
and
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
agency
to
resolve
in
the
first
instance
if
this
court
were
to
disagree
with
us
on
the
definition
of
"child".
i
referred
a
minute
ago
to
the
1939
act
and
the
structure
of
that
act,
and
i
think
that's
very
instructive
because
again
the
way
that
the
provisions
were
arranged
in
the
1939
act,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
were
the
same
for
present
purposes
as
they
are
today,
and
congress
when
it
amended
the
act
in
the
1960s
to
allow
certain
nonmarital
children
to
be
eligible
for
child
status
recognized
that
that
was
the
case,
recognized
the
commission's
interpretation
that
that
everybody
had
to
go
through
416(h)
and
establish
their
eligibility
under
state
law,
and
then
chose
to
make
express
exceptions
to
the
requirement
of
state
law
for
those
children.
no
such
exception
applies
here.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
since
the
social
security
administration
has
consistently
interpreted
the
act
to
require
all
natural
children
to
establish
their
eligibility
under
416(h),
either
by
establishing
that
they
can
inherit
under
state
law
or
by
showing
that
they
qualify
under
one
of
the
express
exceptions.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
--
the
principal
problem
with
that,
i
think,
is
that
it
lacks
--
it's
not
supported
by
the
text
of
what
416(h)
says.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
would
point
to
(h)(2)(b)
and
(h)(3),
both
of
which
are
--
are
the
exceptions
to
allow
people
to
qualify
when
they
can't
establish
state
intestacy
rights,
and
both
of
which
refer
to
someone
who
is
the
son
or
daughter
of
the
insured
person
but
is
not,
and
is
not
deemed
to
be,
the
child.
so
if
biological
parentage
were
--
were
what
was
determinative
under
(e),
and
if
you
only
looked
at
(h)
when
there
was
some
question
about
biological
parentage,
it
would
--
the
idea
of
someone
who
is
a
son
or
daughter
but
isn't
a
child
would
make
no
sense.
and
so
to
give
effect
to
those
meanings
--
to
give
effect
to
those
provisions,
to
give
them
meaning,
416(h)
has
to
have
broader
application
than
just
in
cases
of
disputed
biological
parentage.
it
is
in
fact
the
gateway
through
which
everyone
has
to
pass,
and
that's
how
the
--
the
agency
has
--
has
so
regarded
it.
the
final
point
i
would
make
is
simply
that
even
if
the
statute
were
silent
on
whether
to
look
to
state
law,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
hesitate,
i
think,
before
creating
what
in
effect
is
a
body
of
federal
common
law
about
parental
status.
here,
of
course,
there
is
an
the
express
textual
command
the
other
way,
and
it
would
be
particularly
inappropriate
to
create
as
respondents
are
urging,
a
federal
rule
that
goes
well
beyond
what
any
state
would
allow
in
the
context--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
the
one
suggested
by
justice
kagan
a
few
minutes
ago,
and
that
is
that
you
have
to
read
the
first
and
second
sentences
together.
and
the
first
sentence
sets
up
a
general
rule
that
you
are
looking
to
state
law,
and
then
the
second
is
about
people
who
would
have
the
same
status
as
children
under
state
law,
so
that
the
basic
background
definition
in
--
in
either
case
is
coming
from
state
law.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
well,
the
second
--
maybe,
i
may
be
misunderstanding
you,
but
our
view
of
what
the
second
sentence
does
is
that
it
covers
people
who
are
not
treated
as
children,
who
are
not
children
under
state
law,
but
nonetheless
have
the
inheritance
right
of
children
so
principally
the
--
in
the
case
of
equitable
adoption,
those
people
would
have
the
status
of
children.
