justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
a
state
legislature
got
the
crazy
idea
that
children
born
to
married
people
during
the
time
of
the
marriage
shouldn't
inherit
under
state
intestacy
law.
would
that
mean
that
they
would
be
ineligible
for
survivors'
benefits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
they
did
--
what
if
they
did
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
maybe
it
means
something
else.
maybe
it
means
that
to
the
congress
that
initially
enacted
the
predecessor
of
this
provision
a
child
was
a
child.
they
knew
what
a
child
was.
and
the
type
of
child
that
i
mentioned
earlier
was
a
child.
there
wasn't
a
need
for
any
definition
of
that.
and
they
--
they
never
had
any
inkling
about
the
situation
that
has
arisen
in
this
case,
just
as
they
had
no
inkling
that
any
state
would
go
off
and
take
away
intestacy
rights
for
children
born
to
married
people
during
the
course
of
their
marriage.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
doesn't
the
last
sentence
of
--
what
is
it
--
(h)(2)(a)
show
that
congress
had
in
mind
a
certain
idea
of
a
category
of
people
who
were
indisputably
children?
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
around
that.
because
it
says
what
you
are
looking
for
under
state
law
is
to
determine
whether
someone
has
the
same
status
relative
to
taking
intestate
personal
property
as
a
child.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
person
is
a
child,
you
have
applicants
who
according
to
state
law
had
the
same
status
as
a
child,
a
person
has
that
status
because
the
person
is
a
child,
and
the
person
is
deemed
to
be
a
child
--
it
seems
very
clear
that
that
shows
that
(h),
that
this
provision
is
directed
to
people
that
congress
in
1939
did
not
think
fell
within
this
paradigm
of
a
child.
