i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
impression
is
that,
i'm
not
sure
it's
by
statute,
but
just
by
judicial
decision,
a
child
born
in
the
marriage
is
a
child
of
the
marriage
unless
--
unless
the
child
is
repudiated
by
--
by
the
father.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
rely
only
on
that
--
on
that
definition?
the
section
is
entitled
"old
age
and
survivors'
insurance
benefit
payments.
"
and
it
also
provides
in
(d)
that
a
child
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
if,
among
other
things,
"(c),
was
dependent
upon
such
individual,
(1),
if
such
individual
is
living
at
the
time
that
the
application
was
filed;
(2),
if
such
individual
has
died
at
the
time
of
death;
or
(3),
if
such
individual
had
a
period
of
disability.
"
etcetera,
etcetera.
it
seems
to
me
--
is
the
word
"survivor"
used
anywhere
in
the
text
of
this
statute
except
in
the
--
in
the
heading
of
this
section?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
use
titles
to
determine
the
meaning
of
ambiguous
provisions
later,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
would
he
meet
the
requirements
of
(c),
would
he?
would
he
meet
any
of
the
requirements
of
(c),
of
(d)(1)(c).
justice
antonin
scalia
then
what
does
(d)(1)(c)
do
if
it's
all
washed
out
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
says
every
child
as
defined
in
416(e)
has
to
meet
that
requirement.
if
such
--
such
child,
the
one
defined
in
(e).
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you

go
ahead,
finish.
justice

counsel,
i
now
have
in
front
of
me
(h)(3).
i
don't
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
child
was
dependent
under
(d)(1)(c).
why
do
you
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
unless
such
individual
was
not
living
with
or
contributing
to
the
support
of
such
child,
which
is
certainly
the
case
here
--
the
child
had
not
yet
been
born
--
and
other
qualifications.
the
principal
condition
does
not
exist.
"shall
be
deemed
dependent
upon
his
father
or
adopting
father
unless
at
such
time
such
individual,
mother
or
father
or
adopted
father,
was
not
living
with
or
contributing
to
the
support
of
such
child.
"
how
does
that
alter
the
dependency
requirement
of
(d)(1)(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be.
if
that
is
ambiguous,
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
(d)(1)(c),
despite
--
what
is
it
(h)(3)
or
whatever
the
3
we've
been
playing
with
here,
despite
(d)(3),
despite
that
it
seems
to
me
that
they
don't
meet
that
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't,
i
don't
--
look.
when
congress
says
"child",
"child"
means
child,
and
the
mere
fact
that
congress
wrote
that
at
an
age
when
most
children
were
indeed
children
of
married
people
doesn't
change
the
word
"child".
i
mean,
we
don't
go
back
and
say
--
congress
often
uses
words
that
go
beyond
what
--
what
their
immediate
concern
is,
and
here
they
use
the
word
"child".
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
probe
their
mind
and
say,
well,
since
90
percent
of
all
children
were
children
of
married
people,
that's
what
they
must
have
meant
by
child.
i
just
don't
think
that
follows
at
all.
"child"
means
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
disfavors
children
who
are
born
after
the
father
has
died.
which
is
in
accord
with
the
title
of
the
statute:
survivors
benefits.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
whether
children
that
have
been
born
through
artificial
insemination
get
benefits.
it's
whether
children
who
are
born
after
the
father's
death
gets
benefits.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
haven't
found
the
sentence
you're
talking
about.
where
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
bottom
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
i
know
that
the
government
didn't
rely
on
it,
but
just
to
satisfy
my
curiosity,
how
--
how
can
this
child
satisfy
the
requirements
of
(d)(1)(c),
with
regard
to
dependency
upon
the
father?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but--
justice
antonin

--that
is
connected
with
this
other
issue.
