mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
can,
i
will
start
with
a
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked
about
ambiguity
or
not
of
the
statute,
and
we
think
that
in
fact
the
statute
is
not
ambiguous
at
all.
we
think
that
it
unambiguously
dictates
the
reading
that
we
advance.
and
it's
useful,
i
think,
in
addressing
the
case
to
recognize
that
it
presents
essentially
two
issues.
one
is
whether
all
of
the
categories
of
applicants
for
child
survivor
benefits
that
are
defined
to
be
children
in
the
statutory
definition
of
416,
qualify
for
child
benefits
without
reference
to
state
law,
as
we
submit.
if
they
do,
then
the
second
question
is
whether
the
children
in
this
case,
the
capato
twins,
fall
within
one
of
the
categories
of
children
so
defined,
and
we
think
that
they
very
clearly
do.
congress
said
expressly
that
every
child
as
defined
by
416(e)
shall
receive
benefits
so
long
as
they
satisfy
certain
criteria
that
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
section
416(e),
to
which
congress
has
expressly
directed
us
in
determining
who
is
a
child
eligible
for
these
benefits,
defines
a
child
to
be:
"(1)
a
child
or
adopted
child;
(2)
a
stepchild--
"
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
think
section
416(e)
is
sufficient
as
to
the
children
defined
to
be
a
child
within
that
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
our
understanding
of
who
falls
within
section
416(e),
(e)(1),
definition
of
child,
is
the
natural
child,
the
biological
child
of
married
parents.
there
of
course--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
the
question,
what
(h)
is
designed
to
accomplish.
we
think
that
congress
enacted
(h)
for
children
whose
parentage
or
parental
relationships
were
unclear,
which
would
principally
would
have
been
children
who
were
born
outside
of
marriage,
as
to
whom
there
was
no
presumption--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that's
an
interesting
and
more
difficult
question
than
what
we
have
here.
i
think
that
the
answer
may
well
be
yes,
and
i
think
that
the
situations
like
that
can
arise
really
in
--
outside
of
the
ivf
context.
that's
a
related
situation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
answer
both
of
those
questions.
as
to
where
marriage
comes
from,
i
think
from
a
number
of
sources.
one
is
the
point
that
was
raised
by
justice
alito
and
justice
kagan,
that
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1939
the
overwhelming
majority
of
children
in
the
united
states,
more
than
90
percent
--
it
was
actually
more
than
95
percent
--
were
the
children
of
married
parents.
and
so
when
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it's
simply
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
said
a
child
is
a
child.
you
asked
where
marriage
comes
from
in
the
statute.
i
think
when
congress
said
a
child
is
a
child,
as
i
think
justice
alito's
question
suggested,
it
would
have
had
in
mind
the
paradigm
of
a
child
at
that
time,
which
was
the
children--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--let
me
say
two
things
about
that,
and
first,
to
continue
the
question
of
where
marriage
comes
from,
there
is
a
textual
reference
to
marriage
which
appears
in
section
416(h)(2)(b),
the
companion
to
the
intestacy
provision
upon
which
the
government
relies.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
i
think
(h)
reflects
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
statutory
definition.
because
in
the
provision
that
i'm
referring
to
congress
said
that
if
the
parents
went
through
a
form
of
marriage
that
was
defective
in
some
sense,
nevertheless
the
child
would
be
deemed
to
be
a
child,
which
tells
us
that
marriage,
(a),
was
a
significant
part
of
what
constitutes
childness
as
defined--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
may,
congress
wrote
a
federal
definition
of
mr.
miller
acknowledged
in
his
opening
argument,
when
congress
defined
"child"
it
defined
"child"
to
include
a
number
of
things.
the
first
thing
that
it
defined
is
a
child
is
a
child
or
adopted
child,
stepchild,
grandchild,
step-grandchild.
congress
used
the
word
"child"
to
have
a
particular
meaning,
because
it
said
a
child
is
a
child
and
other
things.
the
other
things
that
it
mentioned
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
reason
it
did
that,
again
as
mr.
miller
said,
child
used
the
"child"
in
two
senses.
it
used
the
word
"child"
in
the
generic
sense,
everyone
who
qualifies
for
child
benefits
is
a
child.
so
it
said
"child"
is,
in
that
sense,
a
child,
adopted
child,
stepchild,
so
forth.
in
the
dependency
section
congress
is
referring
to
all
children,
all
children
in
that,
in
the
generic
sense,
everybody
who
qualifies
for
benefits
as
a
child.
and
therefore
congress
had
to
distinguish
between
what
we
say
it
meant
when
it
said
a
child
is
a
child,
natural
child
of
married
parents.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
can't
point
to
specifically
that,
because
i
think
it
was
clear
when
congress
used
the
word
"child"
that
that's
what
they
had
in
mind
as
a
generic
matter.
as
i
suggested,
when--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
a
sense,
that's
right.
if
everyone
knew
what
the
word
--
the
word
"child"
was
used
to
define,
i
think,
the
category
that
people
would
have
had
in
mind
when
they
thought
of
a
child
in
the
legal
sense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
true.
but
i
think
the
question
is,
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
wrote
this
statute
in
1939?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that
to
me
suggests
that
an
unfavorable
application
of
the
statute
to
children
born
out
of
wedlock
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
provide
benefits
to
these
children.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
--
contrary
to
that
i
think
you
should
interpret
it
our
way
because
the
government's
application
disfavors
children
who
are
born
through,
you
know,
artificial
--
through
assisted
means
by
its
incorporation
of
state
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
i
think
--
i
suspect
the
reason
that
mr.
miller
was
resisting
your
questions
on
that
point
is
there
is
no
question
that
children
who
are
born,
who
are
pro-conceived
naturally
in
the
marriage
and
are
born
after
the
father's
death
are
deemed
to
be
dependents
and
receive
benefits.
that
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
agency,
and
we
think
that
that
is
clearly
right.
so
--
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
the
child
was
born
after
death
says
dispositively
that
they
were
not
dependent
upon--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
we
think
not.
because
what
we
think
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
said
in
the
first
part
of
clause
i
of
the
definition
of
child
is
the
child
--
the
natural
child
--
and
i
use
natural
as
distinct
from
adopted
child
or
stepchild
which
were
dealt
with
separately
in
the
statute,
which
is
why
we
think
is
clear
that
congress
was
there
talking
about
natural
children,
biological
children,
the
natural
children
of
married
parents,
which
we
--
as
i
say
the
reason
we
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
think
that
as
congress
wrote
the
statute
in
1939,
that's
correct,
and
that
child
would
then
have
been
referred
to
the
intestacy
provision
on
which
the
government
relies,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
absolutely.
we
think
that
those
provisions
were
added
as
an
additive
provision
as
a
mechanism
for
children
who
did
not
qualify
for
the
definition
to
be
deemed
a
child.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
--
we
argue
that
congress
used
the
word
"child"--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
--
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
think
that
when
congress
said
a
child
is
a
child,
which
is
the
provision
of
the
statute
we
were
referring
to,
is
distinguishing
the
child
from
the
adopted
child
and
stepchild,
and
we
think
they
were
doing
it
in
the
context
of
marriage
because
a,
that
was
the
paradigm
of
family
relationship
at
the
time.
b,
we
think
the
reason
--
what
congress
was
very
concerned
with
accomplishing
in
the
statute
was
that
--
guaranteeing
certainty
in
the
parentage
--
in
parentage
and
the
parental
relationship.
and
it
set
up
a
system
of
--
because
in
1939
there
were
no
genetic
paternity
test.
there
was
no
--
it
was
impossible
to
be
absolutely,
scientifically
certain
as
to
who
the
--
at
least
as
to
father
was.
congress
set
up
a
series
of
proxies
to
establish
whether
or
not
the
applicant
for
child
benefits
was
in
fact
the
child.
the
principal
one
of
those
was
the
marital
relationship
because
in
1939,
as
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
suggested,
there
was
a
very
strong
virtually
per
se
conclusive
presumption
that
a
child
born
in
marriage
was
the
biological
natural
child
of
both
of
the
father
and
mother
of
the
married
couple.
and
so
the
existence
of
the
marriage
was
a
way
of
establishing
in
1939
dispositively
that
the
child
was
the
child
of
the
parents,
the
child
of
the
survivor
--
of
the
insured
whose
eligibility
for
benefits
are
being
invoked
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
we
would
certainly
embrace
it
if
the
court
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
--
we
think
that
we
are
arguing
essentially
a,
sort
of
a
subset
of
that
theory.
our
sense
of
what
congress
was
up
to
was
that
it
wanted
to
assure
certainty,
as
i
just
said
in
response
to
the
previous
question
in
establishing
parentage.
and
the
principal
way
in
1939
that
congress
could
do
that
was
by
a,
invoking
existence
of
a
parental
relationship
which
established
sort
of
as
a
pro
se
matter
that
the
children
born
within
the
marriage
were
the
children
of
each
of
the
married
--
each
member
of
the
married
couple.
for
parents
--
children
who
do
not
fall
into
that
category
there
was
this
additive
provision
of
section
(h)
which
provided
a
mechanism
for
doing
it
and
establishing
that
state
intestacy
law
would
recognize
this
child
as
the
child
of,
typically
it
was
going
to
be
the
attorney
that
was
contested
--
the
child
of
the
father
--
each
established
a
mechanism
for
doing
that.
so
i
think
that
we
are
getting
to
the
same
place
that
your
question
suggests.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
our
argument
would
be
the
same,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
almost
all
of
these
cases
involve
who
were
born
relatively
soon
after--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
don't
necessarily
have
to,
but
i
think
the
practical
reason
why
they
do
is
that
it's
often
the
case
that
the
surviving
mother
has
children
to
produce
a
family
sibling
for
an
already
existing
child
as
was--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
is
no
reason,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
potentially,
that's
correct.
there
are
rules
in
the
act
that
prevent
double
recovery
of
survivor
benefits,
so
i
don't
think
that
would
be
an
issue
that
would
arise
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
the
question
that
the
court
has
to
confront
is,
congress
wrote
a
federal
definition
of
the
word
"child".
and
it
was
--
sort
of
the
first
question
in
the
case,
i
think,
is
whether
we
are
correct
in
our
understanding
that
when
congress
wrote
this
definition,
all
applicants
for
child
survivor
benefits
fall
within
that
category,
those
defined
categories
qualify.
and
then
we
have
--
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
and
so
children
as
defined
in
clause
i
of
the
definition,
which
we
think
that
the
capato
children
do,
whether
or
not
all
children
so
defined
qualify
for
benefits
without
regard
to
state
intestacy
law.
if
we
are
right
about
that,
then
that
raises
the
question,
what
is
the
meaning
of
"child"
in
the
statute.
and
we
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
no
that's
no
what
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
answer
to
the
first
sentence
of
section
(h),
if
that
were
the
only
thing
in
the
statute,
i
think
that
you
would
be
right,
but
there's
a
second
sentence
to
(h),
which
says
in
--
in
applying
state
intestacy
law,
the
--
the
commissioner
is
supposed
to
look
at
the
status
of
an
applicant
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
status
of
the
applicant
is
the
same
as
that
of
a
child.
and
if
so,
the
applicant
is
deemed
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
appears
in--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
bottom
of
the
paragraph.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
as
a
child.
why
does
it
--
it
requires
a
comparison
to
someone
who
is
a
child.
child
is
defined
in
section
(h).
if
--
if
--
i
think
the
problem
with
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
first
sentence
of
that
--
of
section
(h)
is
that
it
makes
the
--
the
statute
circular.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
at
page
9a
of
the
government
--
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that's
our
explanation
of
what
congress
is
up
to
in
the
statute.
it
--
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
was
an
additive
provision
that
says
that
if
you
are
the
same
--
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point,
justice
breyer
--
if
you
are
the
same
as
a
child,
you
are
deemed
to
have
child
status.
you
can't--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
--
i
think
that
is
not
a
plausible
reading
of
--
of
the
text
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
he
--
he
would
not.
the
father
did
in
fact
write
such
a
note,
but
i
--
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
that
has
to
be
during
the
life
of
the
father.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
want
to
argue
against
my
--
my
position.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
congress
wrote
a
federal
definition
of
"child",
and
it's
not
an
extraordinary
thing
for
congress
to
write
a
statute
that
has
language
that
applies
in
certain
circumstances
and
then
the
world
changes.
new
developments
require
application
of
the
statutory
text
to
those
new
developments.
if
--
if
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct
--
if
what
we
think
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
wrote
this
statute
was
that
it
wanted
to
set
in
place
categories
of
applicants
for
child
benefits
as
to
whom
parentage
in
a
relevant
sense
could
be
determined
with
certainty,
and
it
did
that
by
focusing
on
status
of
the
marital
relationship
between
the
parents,
and
it
did
it
by
providing
an
alternative
basis
in
section
(h)--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
--
and
i
think
actually
that
is
a
helpful
point
for
us,
justice
ginsburg,
because
in
determining
whether
an
applicant
is
a
child
for
purposes
of
the
subchapter,
it's
referring
to
the
use
of
the
word
"child"
in
the
generic
sense.
in
the
sense
--
when
--
when
congress
said
a
child
is
defined
to
include
people
who
fall
in
these
various
categories
of
children.
so
everybody--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
these
two
sentences
have
to
be
read
together
as
accomplishing
the
same
thing.
when
i
--
i
think
what
the
--
what
it's
saying
that
in
making
the
determination
whether
or
not
a
child
qualifies
for
child
benefits,
that
the
commissioner
--
applicants
reporting
to
such
law
would
have
the
same
status
relative
to
taking
intestate
personal
property
as
a
child
shall
be
deemed
such.
i
think
one
can't
apply
the
statute
without
knowing
who
a
child
is,
because
if
--
it
is
directing
the
commissioner
to
engage
in
a
comparison.
it's
directing
the
commissioner
to
say
does
this
applicant
have
the
same
status--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
and
i
--
i
think
though
what
it's
telling
the
commissioner
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
or
not,
when
an
applicant
who
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
defined
categories
of
section
(e)
applies
for
benefits,
the
commissioner
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
child
has
the
same
status
relative
to
state
law
as
the
child
as
defined
in
the
definitional
section.
i
mean,
congress
--
as
i
say,
congress
said
expressly
that
a
child
as
defined
in
section
416(e)
of
the
statute
qualifies
for
benefits.
and
so
i
think
it
establishes
a
federal
standard
as
to
what
--
what
a
child
is
for
purposes
of
the
act.
the
court
has
to
determine
what
that
standard
means
to
apply
to
any
particular
child.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
a
mess.
i
think
the
problem
is
that
we're
dealing
with
new
technologies
that
congress
didn't
develop
--
wasn't
anticipating
at
the
time.
i
think
--
one
of
the
questions
that
was
suggested
to
my
friend,
mr.
miller,
by
justice
alito,
i
think,
is
that
if
the
child
who
--
in
1939
--
who
was
the
--
the
child
of
married
parents,
natural
child
of
married
parents,
sought
benefits
under
this
statute
and
they
were
denied
because
some
state
developed
an
aberrant
law
of
intestacy
and
said
that
such
child
would
not
qualify,
be
not
be
deemed
to
be
the
child
of
their
parents,
i
think
that
that
would
have
been
regarded
as
--
as
clear
misreading
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
we
have
to
convince
you
not
to
give
the
statute
its
plain
reading,
then
--
then
we
will
not
--
going
to
prevail.
i
certainly
recognize
that
that
plain
meaning
has
to
control.
and
as
i
suggested
at
the
outset,
the
reason
we
think
we
prevail
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute
as
was
written
in
1939,
and
as
it
would
have
been
understood
by
the
1939
congress
that
adopted
it
--
was
that
the
actual
children
of
married
parents,
the
paradigm
of
the
situation
of
the
child
at
that
time,
would
fall
into
this
category.
now,
it
is
certainly
true,
as
you
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
every
state
law
--
i
would
put
it
the
other
way:
every
state
law
has
recognized
them
as
such
because
that
was
the
way
in
which
children
were
understood
--
the
meaning
of
the
term
"child"
was
understood
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
one
has
to
look
at
what
the
congress
at
the
time
--
i
guess
i'll
put
it
this
way:
if
--
if
the
court
were
to
accept
our
view
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
children
of
married
parents,
the
question
is
whether
any
particular
child
falls
in
the
box
congress
would
have
regarded
as
the
marital
box
or
the
non-married
box.
situations
like
this
simply
could
not
have
arisen
in
1939.
congress
would
not
have
--
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
congress
would
not
have
specifically
had
in
mind,
contemplated
the
question
of
posthumous
conception.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
guess
two
responses
to
that.
one,
as
mr.
miller
said,
this
--
that
issue
has
--
was
remanded
to
be
addressed
by
--
by--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
the
answer--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
answer
--
the
answer
why
we
think
--
and
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
answer
it,
the
reason
that
we
think
we
would
prevail
on
that
question
is
because
as
mr.
miller
said,
congress
created
a
--
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
child
of
--
the
legitimate
child
of
--
of
a
parent
is
deemed
to
have
been
dependent
upon
that
parent
at
the
time
of
the
parent's
death.
and
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
