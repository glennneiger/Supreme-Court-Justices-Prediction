chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-159,
astrue
v.
capato.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
don't
always
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
said
earlier
that
the
state
intestacy
law
provides
clear
rules,
but
i
assume
that's
not
always
the
case,
particularly
with
all
this
new
technological
advancement.
there
must
be
circumstances
where
you
can't
tell
what
state
intestacy
law
provides.
and
what
does
the
social
security
administration
do
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
that
there
is
no
clear
answer.
i
mean,
let's
take
a
situation
where
this
type
of
--
of
reproduction
is
--
is
new,
and
the
state
legislatures
haven't
had
a
chance
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
recognize
the
offspring
for
state
intestacy
law
or
not.
what
would
ssa
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
children
--
well,
i
don't
want
--
the
capato
twins
were
conceived
four
years
after
of
the
death
in
this
case?
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
why
would
they
all
involve
children
born
relatively
soon
after?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
no
reason
it
couldn't
take
place
four
years
after.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
happens
if
the
biological
mother
remarries
or
something
and
then
goes
through
this
process?
does
the
child
get
double
survivor
benefits
or
--
which
--
i
assume
you
would
argue
that
in
that
case
the
child
is
eligible
through
two
different
routes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
under
chevron,
you
lose
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
is
there
any
reason
we
shouldn't
conclude
based
on
the
last
hour
that
it's
at
least
ambiguous?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
miller,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
miller,
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
in
case
number
11-159,
astrue
versus
capato.
