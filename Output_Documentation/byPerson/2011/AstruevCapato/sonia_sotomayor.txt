there
was
in
my
memory,
and
it's
been
a
while,
that
some
states,
if
not
all
--
and
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
basically
deem
any
child
born
during
the
marriage
to
be
a
child
of
the
marriage,
whether
it's
a
biological
child
or
not,
so
that
if
a
mother
has
had
a
relationship
outside
of
marriage
the
married
parent
is
still
responsible
for
that
child.
that
would
take
care
of,
i
think,
a
great
number,
wouldn't
it,
of
the
new
technology
births
that
occur
without
perhaps
the
input
of
one
of
--
the
biological
input
of
one
of
the
parents?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
my
question
was,
do
all
states
have
similar
rulings?
and
for
those
that
don't,
what
happens
to
a
child
that's
been
born
with,
as
justice
roberts
said,
as
the
chief
said,
with
new
technology?
what
happens
to
that
child
in
terms
of
their
definition
of
whether
they
will
be
considered
a
child
for
social
security
purposes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
rebuttable
presumption
or
irrebuttable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
may
i
ask?
justice
scalia
said
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
is
that
your
position?
is
it
your
position
that
the
definition
of
"child"
is
ambiguous
and
that
we
have
to
give
the
agency
deference,
or
is
it
your
position
that
in
the
context
it's
unambiguous
and
even
if
the
social
security
administration
wanted
to
extend
benefits,
it
couldn't,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
could
you
tell
me
what
purpose
416(h)
serves
in
this
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--given
that
you
believe
that
416(e)
is
self-sufficient
unto
itself.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
the
child
who
should
receive.
so
what
the
purpose
of
(h)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
--
a
child
who
was
born
during
marriage
but
is
not
a
biological
child
wouldn't
qualify?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
though
they
qualify
under
state
law
as
a
child?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
this
--
let's
assume
ms.
capato
remarried
but
used
her
deceased
husband's
sperm
to
birth
two
children.
they
are
the
biological
children
of
the
capatos.
would
they
qualify
for
survivor
benefits
even
though
she
is
now
remarried?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
see,
a
situation
like
that
is
what
is
making
me
uncomfortable,
because
i
don't
see
the
words
"biological"
in
the
statute.
i
don't
see
the
word
"marriage"
directly
when
--
within
the
definition
of
"child".
so
where
do
i
draw
them
from?
where
do
i
come--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that
would
be
true
under
state
intestate
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
interested
as
to
what
your
definition
of
child
is.
is
it
just
a
biological
offspring?
is
it
limited
to
a
biological
offspring
born
of
a
particular
marriage?
but
in
what
context?
because
we
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
of
what
happens
if
the
--
if
the
decedent
is
the
mother.
there
is
no
question
that
she
bore
this
child.
married
or
unmarried,
does
it
matter?
does
marriage
matter
only
if
it's
the
father
that's
the
decedent?
what
is
your
--
if
you
are
a
sperm
donor,
does
any
offspring
that
sperm
donor
have
qualify?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
mother
who
is
unmarried
who
bears
a
child,
this
child
is
not
automatically
covered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
so
there
are
situations
in
which
you
think
those
provisions
should
govern.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
what
was
not
clear
to
me.
so
you
are
--
you
are
not
arguing
that
"child"
has
just
one
natural
meaning.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
whatever
meaning
you
could
give
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
--
do
you
think
that
congress
thought
of
either
of
these
situations
as
real
possibilities?
do
you
really
think
that
the
1939
congress,
or
even
the
one
that
passed
the
later
statute,
ever
thought
that
a
state
would
disinherit
a
naturally
born
--
all
naturally
born
children
--
or
that
children
could
be
born
18
months,
4
years,
50
years
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
weren't
thinking
of
either.
so
the
question
becomes,
given
the
language
of
(h)
that
says
define
"child"
this
way
throughout
the
subchapter,
why
shouldn't
we
give
that
directive
its
plain
meaning?
that's
really
the
argument
that
you
have
to
convince
us
of.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
because
every
state
law
recognized
them
as
such
as
well.
correct?
