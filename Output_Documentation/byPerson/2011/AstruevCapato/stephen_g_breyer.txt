justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
what
you
haven't
mentioned
the
text
that
suggests
you
are
not
right,
which
is
right
in
(h)
which
says,
"in
determining
whether
an
applicant
is
a
child
of
an
insured,
the
commissioner
shall
apply
such
law
as
intestacy
law.
"
okay?
that's
what
it
says.
now,
how
do
you
get
out
of
that?
because
you
say
well,
there
is
an
implicit
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
that
that
doesn't
apply.
and
so
i've
listened
carefully
to
your
reasons
for
saying
why
(h)
doesn't
apply
when
its
language
seems
to
say
it
does
apply,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
why
it
doesn't
apply.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
that
two
parents
have
lived
together
for
six
years
and
four
months
in
state
x,
and
they
have
a
child.
fine.
the
father
dies.
were
they
married?
they
never
went
through
a
ceremony.
is
there
a
common
law
marriage?
might
it
depend
on
the
state?
do
you
know
the
answer
in
every
state?
my
answer
is:
you
don't
know.
and
i
don't
know.
and,
therefore,
we
have
to
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
in
order
to
see
whether
that
(e)
is
satisfied.
now
we
have
to
look
to
it
to
decide
if
they
are
married.
even
you
say
that.
so
what
congress
did
is
it
found
a
pretty
good
shorthand
way
of
saying
where
you
look.
we
are
not
going
to
worry
about
six
years
and
two
months;
we
are
just
going
to
look
at
their
intestacy
law.
that,
as
i
read
it,
is
what
it
seems
to
say.
now
i
have
been
listening
to
you
listening
to
you,
and
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
save
us
from
even
worse
problems,
particularly
when
i
started
looking
at
the
state
of
the
artificial
insemination
and
so
forth,
and
every
state
has
a
dozen
different
variations;
there
are
uniform
acts,
there
are
things
you
have
to
acknowledge
in
writing.
it's
a
very
complicated
subject.
and
--
and
that's
why
i
am
rather
hesitant
to
read
it
the
way
you
want.
but
i
want
you
to
reply
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
that
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
"applicants
who
according
to
such
law
would
have
had
the
same
status
relative
to
taking
intestate
property
as
a
child
or
a
parent
shall
be
deemed
such.
"
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
bottom.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
sort
of
like
a
--
you
say
there
is
no
board
of
taxes.
sorry,
i
don't
think
that.
but
--
because
they
used
the
word
"deemed".
is
that
right?
that's
the
heart
of
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
obvious
practical
thing
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
--
that,
you
know,
once
you
get
beyond
this
and
the
child
wasn't
even
--
if
he's
conceived
--
or
what
the
father
could
do,
couldn't
he
just
write
a
note
and
say
this
is
my
child
even
if
it's
conceived
later,
and
then
wouldn't
he
fall
within
one
of
these
other
exceptions,
the
exception
for
being
acknowledged?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
has
acknowledged
in
writing
that
the
applicant
is
his
son
or
daughter.
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it?
he
doesn't
say
it.
i
mean,
it
seemed
to
me
easier
to
work
with
that
one
than
the
one
you're
trying
to
work
with.
but
i
--
i
don't
know.
you're
the
--
but
--
but
anyway,
what
i'm
worried
about
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
i
know.
[laughter]
okay.
what
i'm
actually
worried
about
and
want
you
to
address
is,
i
just
--
if
we
were
to
adopt
what
you
said,
what
they're
concerned
about
is
many
different
applicants
coming
back
later
--
that's
what
state
intestacy
is
concerned
about.
and
you
don't
really
know
who
their
parents
is.
another
thing
is
there
are
already
children
who
are
eating
up
all
of
the
money.
and
then
some
new
person
shows
up
and
you
have
to
take
the
money
away
from
the
other
children
in
order
to
give
it
to
this
new
child.
and
all
the
time,
you
don't
know
if
that's
what
the
parent
who
was
dead
really
wanted.
and
so
that's
why
the
states
have
gone
into
all
kinds
of
writing
requirements.
and
--
and
you
want
us
to
sort
of
--
applying
this
old
law
to
new
technology,
just
overlook
those
complications.
