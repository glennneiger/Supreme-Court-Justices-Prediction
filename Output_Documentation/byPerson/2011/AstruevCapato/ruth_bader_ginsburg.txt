those
are
--
those
are
obviously
meant
to
deal
with
--
with
children
whose
parents
are
not
married.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
provision
in
(h)
that
is
puzzling
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me
what
it
means.
it's
at
(h)(2)(a),
and
it's
the
last
sentence
of
(a).
it
says:
"applicants
who
according
to
state
law
would
have
the
same
status
relative
to
taking
intestate
personal
property
as
a
child
shall
be
deemed
such.
"
what
person
is
that
referring
to?
someone
who
is
not
a
child
but
has
the
same
status
as
a
child?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anyone
else
or
just
that
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
--
it
was
addressed
in
the
ninth
--
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
words
--
you
say
this
is
plain
meaning.
it
says
the
child
of
a
wage
earner,
an
individual.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
importing
the
term
"married",
because
someone
can
be
the
undisputed
child
of
a
wage
earner
who
is
unmarried.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
disputed
versus
undisputed.
a
wage
earner
can
have
a
child,
undisputed
that
the
wage
earner
is
parent,
but
the
wage
earner
is
not
married.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
we
weren't
supposed
to
look
to
(h)
at
all.
your
thesis
is
(e)
covers
it
and
there
is
no
reason
to
refer
to
(h).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
don't
you
run
into
a
problem,
perhaps
not
in
1939;
but
since
then
this
court
has
had
a
number
of
decisions
that
deal
with
the
distinction
between
children
born
in
and
out
of
wedlock,
and
in
some
of
those
cases
it
has
held
that
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
unconstitutional,
that
there
are
no
illegitimate
children,
all
children
are
legitimate,
whatever
their
parents
may
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
we
are
going
to
apply
those
equal
protection
decisions
to
this
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
rothfeld,
these
children
were
born
18
months
after
the
insured
wage
earner
died.
if
we
look
to
other
categories
of
children,
say,
stepchildren,
and
there
is
also
one
for
adopted
children,
for
stepchildren,
they
qualify
only
if
they
had
that
status
no
less
than
nine
months
before
the
wage
earner
died,
and
adopted
children
is
also
a
limitation.
the
stepchild
and
the
adopted
child,
there
could
never
be
any
question
of
being
born
18
months
later.
they
wouldn't
qualify.
there
is
a
time
limit
for
the
other
children.
and
if
congress
had
thought
about
this
problem,
maybe
it
would
put
a
time
limit
on
this,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
would
be
fine
if
the
statute
said
what
you
claim
it
said.
it
says
a
child
is
a
child
of
a
wage
earner.
and
you'd
have
to
import
these
things
that
congress
didn't
say
to
get
to
what
you
claim
is
the
plain
meaning.
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
sentence
in
(h)(2)(a)
that
says
"in
determining
that
an
applicant
is
a
child
of
an
insured
individual
for
purposes
of
this
subchapter.
"
the
subchapter
is
not
for
purposes
of
(h),
but
for
purposes
of
the
entire
subchapter,
which
would
include
(e).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
could
it
do
that
when
the
rest
of
the
sentence
says,
"to
determine
whether
an
applicant
is
a
child
for
purposes
of
this
subchapter,
the
commissioner
shall
apply
the
state
law
of
intestacy?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
1939
understanding,
wasn't
it
also
understood
that
the
marriage
ends
when
a
parent
dies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
wouldn't
be
--
a
child
that
is
born
18
months
after
the
father
died
wouldn't
be
considered
a
child
of
the
marriage,
because
the
marriage
would
have
ended.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
entitlement
of
children
conceived
after
the
death
of
their
father
to
social
security
survivor's
benefits.
to
qualify
as
a
survivor
of
a
deceased
wage
earner,
a
child
so
conceived,
like
child
applicants
generally,
must
be
eligible
to
inherit
from
the
insured
under
state
intestacy
law.
that
standard
was
not
met
in
this
case.
the
children
in
question
are
twins
conceived
through
in
vitro
fertilization
using
deceased
wage
earner,
robert
capato's
frozen
sperm.
they
were
born
18
months
after
his
death.
the
social
security
administration
denied
an
application
for
benefits
filed
on
the
twins'
behalf
by
their
mother,
karen
capato,
widow
of
the
wage
earner.
the
reason
for
the
denial,
robert
capato
died
domiciled
in
florida,
and
under
that
state
law,
children
conceived
after
a
parent's
death
do
not
qualify
for
intestate
succession.
on
judicial
review,
the
federal
district
court
affirmed
the
denial
of
benefits,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
however
reversed.
it
held
that
biological
children
of
married
parents
are
survivors
entitled
to
benefits
without
regard
to
state
intestacy
law.
the
governing
social
security
provisions
state
first
in
42
u.s.c.
section
402(d)
that
benefits
are
payable
to
every
child
as
defined
in
section
416(e).
416(e)
in
turn
defines
child,
as
relevant
here,
to
mean
the
child
of
an
insured
individual.
a
subsequent
provision,
section
416(h)(2)(a),
adds
in
determining
whether
an
applicant
is
the
child
of
an
insured
individual
for
purposes
of
this
subchapter,
the
commissioner
of
social
security
shall
apply
the
intestacy
law
of
the
insured
individual's
domiciliary
state.
respondent
karen
capato,
in
line
with
the
third
circuit,
relies
on
the
initial
definition
of
child
in
416(e),
child
means
the
child
of
an
insured
individual.
because
the
capato
twins
are
undeniably
the
children
of
robert
and
karen
capato,
the
third
circuit
reasoned
they
met
before
416(e)
definition.
there
was
no
cause
to
refer
to
416(h),
the
court
explained,
for
that
section
is
labeled
determination
of
family
status
when,
as
in
this
case,
claimants
of
the
biological
children
of
a
married
couple
the
court
said,
there
is
no
family
status
to
determine
so
for
416(e)
alone
controls.
but
the
social
security
administration
found
that
one
must
read
on
beyond
416(e)
to
determine
who
is
a
child
for
survivor's
benefit
purposes.
section
416(h)
states
explicitly
that
the
definitions
therein
contained
apply
to
the
entire
subchapter,
including
416(e).
in
other
words,
the
416(e)
tautological
definition,
"child"
means
child
is
completed
in
416(h)
which
instructs
that
the
capato
twins
could
gain
benefits
only
if
they
were
entitled
to
inherit
under
the
intestacy
law
of
their
father's
domicile
at
death.
we
agree
that
section
416(h)
serves
as
a
gateway
through
which
all
applicants
for
benefits
as
a
child
must
pass.
resort
to
state
law
on
matters
of
family
status
is
common
in
the
social
security
act,
notably,
the
act
refers
to
state
law
to
determine
an
applicant
status
as
a
wife,
widow,
husband
or
widower.
the
act
also
sets
several
duration
of
relationship
limitations
and
durational
limits
are
also
found
in
state
statutes
that
accord
inherit
into
rights
to
children
conceived
after
their
father's
death.
in
contrast,
under
the
court
of
appeals'
reading,
biological
children
of
married
parents
can
gain
benefits
even
if
their
father
died
many
years
before
their
birth.
reliance
on
state
intestacy
law
to
determine
who
is
a
child
for
survivor's
benefit
purposes,
serves
congress'
main
aim
to
protect
dependent
members
of
wage
earner's
family
against
the
hardship
occasioned
by
the
loss
of
the
insured
earning.
as
this
court
explained
in
prior
case
where
state
intestacy
law
provides
that
a
child
may
take
personal
property
from
a
father's
estate,
it
may
reasonably
meet
that
what
that
the
child
were
more
likely
be
dependent
during
the
parent's
life
and
at
his
death.
in
sum,
we
find
the
social
security
administration's
reading
better
attuned
to
the
statute's
text
and
its
design
to
benefit
primarily
those
that
deceased
wage
earner
actually
supported
in
his
or
her
lifetime
and
even
if
the
agency's
long
standing
interpretation
is
not
the
only
reasonable
one,
it
is
at
least
a
permissible
construction
entitled
to
deference
under
our
decision
in
chevron
u.s.a.
v.
natural
resources
defense
council.
for
the
reasons
stated
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
court's
opinion,
we
reverse
the
third
circuit's
judgement.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
