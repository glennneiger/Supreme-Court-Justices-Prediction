justice
elena
kagan
but
isn't
there
something
sort
of
bizarre
about
your
reading,
because
congress
in
the
(e)
section
sets
up
very
specific
definitions
about
stepchildren
and
grandchildren
and
even
step-grandchildren
in
which
state
intestacy
law
is
not
referenced,
but
you
are
that
saying
that
as
to
the
largest
category,
the
category
in
which
90
percent
of
people
are
going
to
get
benefits,
there
congress
sent
us
all
off
to
state
law.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
i'm
not
so
convinced
that
(h)
is
as
clear
as
you
think
it
is
because
there
are
two
sentences
of
--
of
section
(h).
i'm
just
asking
you
to
provide
a
reason
why
congress
would
have
specified
everything
about
what
--
how
you
get
benefits
for
stepchildren
and
grandchildren
and
stepchildren,
but
not
for
the
main
category
of
people
at
issue.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
miller,
could
i
take
you
back
to
416(e).
i
take
it
that
you
don't
contest
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
that
this
--
which
stepchildren
get
benefits
and
which
grandchildren
get
benefits,
we
are
just
looking
to
federal
law,
that
we
don't
look
to
state
law
on
those
questions;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
you
know,
i'm
looking
at
some
of
these,
the
grandchildren
one
for
example.
it
says
the
person
who
is
the
grandchild,
but
only
if,
blah,
blah,
blah.
it
seems
to
have
just
sort
of
an
understanding
of
what
a
grandchild
is.
in
other
words,
it's
not
really
defining
a
grandchild
here;
it's
limiting
a
class
of
grandchildren
with
a
preexisting
understanding
of
what
a
grandchild
is.
and
so
i'm
wondering,
if
that's
true
of
grandchildren,
why
isn't
it
also
true
of
children?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry,
the
child
of
a
child.
the
child
--
what
kind
of
child?
justice
elena
kagan
oh,
so
for
grandchildren
the
agency
is
also
looking
to
state
law?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
rothfeld,
i
guess
the
question
is,
when
it
says
a
child
is
a
child
does
it
mean
a
child
is
a
child
born
in
wedlock
or
a
child
is
just
a
child.
and
we
know
that
congress
knew
how
to
distinguish
between
the
two
because
congress
distinguished
between
the
two
in
this
very
act
in
the
dependency
provisions.
it
talks
about
the
legitimate
child
of
such
individual.
well,
here
it
didn't
add
that
word.
it
just
said
"the
child".
justice
elena
kagan
are
there
any
other
statutes
that
you
can
point
to
around
this
time
which
support
the
notion
that
when
people
said
"child"
they
meant
child
within
a
legal
marriage?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry,
you
can't
point
to
anything
because
it's
so
clear?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
suppose
the
question
that
is
argued
at
the
very
least
is
getting
us
into
a
situation
where
we
should
interpret
the
statute
the
government's
way
because
of
constitutional
avoidance
concerns.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
i'm
curious
why
you
didn't
argue
a
different
theory
which
is
that
(e)
refers
to
all
biological
children
whether
in
marriage
or
outside
of
marriage
and
the
(h)
is
set
up
for
cases
in
which
biological
status
is
contested.
i
mean,
what
would
you
think
of
that
theory?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
didn't
you
argue
it?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
rothfeld,
why
can't
one
just
say,
well,
first
sentence,
whose
child?
look
to
state
law.
second
sentence,
when
state
law
treats
other
people
as
children,
you
should
treat
them
as
other
--
as
children,
too.
so
the
two
sentences
can
cohere
fine.
for
children,
look
to
state
law,
and
also
look
to
state
law
to
see
who
they
treat
just
like
children.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
not?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
rothfeld.
but
you
have
two
choices.
in
the
second
sentence,
you
do
have
two
groups,
and
one
has
to
be
compared
to
the
other,
which
is
children.
the
question
is,
are
children
described
by
the
first
sentence
of
that,
or
are
children
described
by
the
(e)
section?
so
you're
just
reading
the
first
sentence
out
of
the
statute
and
saying
that
the
second
sentence
totally
subsumes
the
first
sentence
and
we
have
to
go
back
to
(e).
but
the
first
sentence
exists.
and
it
says
who
are
children?
children
are
who
they
are
under
state
law.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
miller,
what
do
you
think
is
wrong
with
the
alternative
theory
that
--
that
i
suggested,
that
(e)
is
all
biological
children
in
a
marriage,
not
in
a
marriage,
doesn't
matter;
and
that
(h)
is
designed
to
deal
with
situations
in
which
biological
status
is
contested?
justice
elena
kagan
but
why
do
you
think
that?
what
would
you
point
to
in
(h)
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
i
just
gave
you?
