justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
could
write
the
opinion
for
us,
what
would
you
hold?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
--
what's
the
definition
of
a
child
for
that
purpose?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
you
--
you
would
hold
you
can't
--
there
cannot
be
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
for
anyone
under
15,
but
for
anybody
over
15,
it
would
be
permissible.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
where
the
age
line
needs
to
be
drawn
for
constitutional
purposes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
where
you
think
the
logic
of
your
argument
leads.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
would
say
that
a
17
--
a
person
of
17
years
and
10
months,
11
months,
who
commits
the
worst
possible
string
of
offenses
still
--
and
demonstrates
great
maturity
--
still
cannot
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that,
that
they
have
not
addressed
it?
if
state
law
allows
it,
have
they
not
addressed
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
legislators
don't
understand
that
their
law
permits
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
don't
really
understand
this
argument.
you
mean
the
legislatures
have
enacted
these
laws,
but
they
don't
realize
that,
under
these
laws,
a
--
a
person
under
the
age
of
18
may
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole
for
--
for
murder.
they
don't
understand
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
think
these
legislators
don't
understand
what
their
laws
provide,
why
don't
you
contact
them?
and
when
they
--
when
you
tell
them,
do
you
realize
that
in
your
state
a
--
a
16-year-old
or
a
17-year-old
may
be
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
without
parole
for
murder,
they'll
say:
oh,
my
gosh,
i
never
realized
that.
let's
change
the
law.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
they've
made
a
decision
on
this.
now
maybe
it's
a
bad
decision--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
i
really
don't
understand
how
you
can
argue
that
they
have
not
made
a
decision
on
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
they
are
not
aware
of
what
their
law
provides.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
state
that
says
expressly
a
juvenile
below
a
certain
age
may
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole
and
a
state
that
says
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
capital
murder,
that
sentence
may
be
imposed
and,
in
another
--
in
another
provision,
says
that
juveniles
may
be
transferred
for
prosecution
as
adults.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
a
difference
between
those
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
even
for
homicide
offenses
that
would
qualify
for
life
imprisonment
without
parole
for
an
adult.
it's
for
any
non-negligent
homicide;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
graham,
didn't
the
court
reject
the
idea
of
individualized
sentencing
in
which
youth
would
be
taken
into
account
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
look
to
objective
indicia,
as
all
of
the
cases
in
this
line
have,
what
is
the
lowest
age
as
to
which
you
can
say
there
is
any
indication
of
a
societal
consensus
that
this
is
okay?
would
it
be
14?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
many
states
allow
it
for
a
13-year-old
or
a
12-year-old?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
10
states
will
allow
it
for
a
12-year-old.
how
many
would
allow
it
for
a
13-year-old?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
legislators
in
pennsylvania
and
michigan
don't
understand
what
their
laws
provide?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
what
--
is
that
true
under
the
law
of
arkansas?
in
most
jurisdictions,
i
would
think
if
--
if
someone's
charged
with
the
highest
degree
of
homicide,
the
defense
can
request
an
instruction
on
--
you
don't
have
to
have
a
separate
charge
on
a
lesser
included
offense;
the
defense
can
request
an
instruction
on
lesser
included
offenses
if
it
could
be
supported
by
the
evidence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so,
you
would
draw
the
line
at
--
at
a
specific
intent
to
kill?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it
was
a
lot
clearer?
what
if
they
had
said,
okay,
before
we
go
in,
let's
understand
what's
going
on
here;
shields
has
got
--
has
got
the
sawed-off
shotgun,
and
if
we
need
to
use
it,
we'll
use
it;
we'll
do
whatever
it
takes
to
--
to
bring
this
off?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
might
not
be
a
specific
intent--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--to
kill
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
arrests
to
start
out
with,
it's
not
--
it's
not
convictions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
it's
not
for
the
type
of
offense
for
which
one
could
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
it's
a
broader
category
of
homicide
offenses.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
true
that
in
the
states
that
permit
life
without
parole
for
a
minor
homicide
--
a
minor
murder,
a
person
--
a
minor
convicted
of
--
of
murder,
that
that
is
permitted
for
every
non-negligent
homicide?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
some
states,
but
not
in
all--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--so
you
have
a
very
imprecise
denominator,
you
have
arrests
for
a
broader
category
of
offenses.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
know
how
much
smaller
that
number
would
be
if
we
narrowed
it
down
appropriately,
do
we?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
court
today
holds
that
neither
congress
nor
the
state
legislatures
may
identify
any
category
of
murderers
under
the
age
of
18
who
must
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
the
decision
thus
goes
far
beyond
the
two
carefully
selected
14-year
old
petitioners
whose
cases
are
before
us.
the
court
could've
limited
its
holding
to
minors
under
the
age
of
15
or
for
that
matter,
to
minors
under
the
age
of
16
or
17
but
it
has
not
done
so.
think
of
the
worst
possible
17-year
old
murderer,
perhaps
a
17-year
old
who
previously
was
convicted
of
several
murders
was
tried
in
family
court
and
has
resisted
any
attempt
at
rehabilitation
or
think
of
a
17-year
old
or
17
and
a
half
year
old,
perhaps,
who
goes
to
school
and
guns
down
a
dozen
or
more
teachers
and
students.
the
opinion
of
the
court
delicately
refers
to
all
murderers
under
the
magic
age
of
18
as
children
and
holds
that
every
single
one
of
these
children
must
be
given
a
chance
to
persuade
a
judge
to
impose
a
lesser
sentence.
what
is
the
court's
basis
for
doing
this?
the
court
says
that
it
is
simply
enforcing
the
eighth
amendment
--
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
following
our
prior
decisions,
the
court
says
that
the
eighth
amendment
embodies
“the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society”.
this
mellifluous
phrase
embodies
a
particular
philosophy
of
history,
namely,
that
civilization
is
progressing
inexorably
toward
ever
higher
standards
of
decency.
that
philosophy
is
debatable
and
it
is
something
of
a
mystery
how
it
ever
became
part
of
our
fundamental
law,
but
the
standard,
as
originally
understood,
had
at
least
one
virtue.
it
called
on
judges
to
look
to
something
other
than
their
own
personal
views.
the
court
emphasized
again
and
again
that
it
could
not
hold
that
a
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
just
because
the
justices
personally
hold
that
view.
no,
it
was
necessary
to
find
what
the
court
called
“objective
indicia
of
society
standards”.
so
where
can
these
objective
indicia
be
found?
the
court
toyed
with
the
idea
of
looking
to
public
opinion
polls.
it
occasionally
surveyed
the
law
of
certain
other
highly
evolved
countries,
but
for
the
most
part,
what
the
court
did
was
to
tally
up
the
--
the
positions
taken
by
the
legislatures
of
the
50
states.
if
a
particular
punishment
for
a
particular
crime
was
challenged,
the
court
looked
to
see
whether
there
was
a
strong
consensus
against
imposing
that
punishment
for
that
offense.
thus,
in
coker
versus
georgia
decided
in
1976,
the
court
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
the
death
sentence
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman,
and
the
court
noted
that
georgia
was
the
only
state
that
allowed
that
punishment
for
that
crime.
98%
of
the
states
took
the
opposing
view.
as
the
years
went
by,
however,
the
evidence
of
objective
indicia
got
weaker
and
weaker
and
by
the
time
when
graham
versus
florida
was
decided
by
this
court
two
years
ago,
the
search
for
objective
indicia
had
become
something
of
a
farce.
in
graham,
both
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
39
states
permitted
a
minor
convicted
of
certain
non-homicide
offenses
to
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
but
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
that
punishment
is
contrary
to
the
eighth
amendment.
22%
of
the
states
was
now
enough
to
constitute
a
consensus.
in
today's
case,
as
you
just
heard,
a
mere
29
state
legislatures
have
proscribed
the
mandatory
term
for
some
sub
18-year
old
murderers,
so
the
court
says,
"look,
29
is
less
than
39
so
that
must
mean
that
there
is
a
consensus
in
our
society
that
a
term
of
life
for
any
murderer
under
the
age
of
18
is
cruel
and
unusual.”
the
court
is
using
some
very
strange
dictionary
in
which
a
distinct
minority
of
the
states
is
enough
to
constitute
a
consensus.
the
court
then
says
something
even
more
remarkable,
and
you
heard
that
argument
today,
it
suggests
that
the
legislatures
of
at
least
some
of
those
29
states
do
not
actually
realize
what
the
law
says
in
their
own
states.
and
this
is
because
in
order
to
understand
that,
you
would
have
to
look
at
two
separate
laws.
one
law
says
that
certain
minors
may
be
tried
as
adults.
another
law
says
that
offenders
committed
--
convicted
of
certain
types
of
murder
must
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
so
maybe
the
state
legislatures
simply
can't
put
two
and
two
together.
of
course,
if
this
is
the
real
problem,
then
the
court
should
be
willing
to
overrule
its
decision
in
this
case
if
enough
state
legislatures
respond
by
passing
resolutions
saying,
“you
know
what,
we're
really
not
that
stupid,
we
really
can't
put
two
and
two
together,
we
know
what
our
state
law
provides,
and
we
think
that
for
certain
minors
who
commit
murder,
the
only
appropriate
sentence
is
life.”
do
not
expect
such
resolutions
to
cause
the
court
to
change
course.
why,
because
the
court
has
now
moved
well
beyond
objective
indicia
of
the
standards
of
the
american
people.
the
decision
in
this
case
is
not
based
on
those
standards.
it
is
based
on
a
vision
of
a
different
society
and
we
vision
of
a
more
evolved,
more
mature
society.
determining
what
is
the
right
punishment
for
a
particular
offense
and
a
particular
offender
involves
balancing
of
interest
and
one
of
those
interests
is
the
interest
of
potential
future
victims.
a
law
requiring
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
for
certain
murderers
represents
a
judgment
by
the
people's
elected
representatives
that
these
murderers
are
simply
too
risky
to
be
released.
maybe
these
murderers,
if
imprisoned
for
some
years,
will
change.
maybe
they
will
mature,
maybe
they
we
--
they
will
be
rehabilitated
but
maybe
they
won't.
58%
of
the
states
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
certain
murderers
under
the
age
of
18,
this
risk
is
one
that
society
should
not
have
to
take.
the
court
now
says
that
the
people
can't
make
that
decision
unless
a
judge
says
otherwise
every
murderer
under
the
age
of
18
is
eligible
for
release
and
if
upon
release,
they
--
they
kill
again,
well,
that
is
a
chance
that
society
just
has
to
take.
nothing
in
the
constitution
gives
us
the
right
to
make
that
decision.
the
constitution
gives
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
great
power
and
responsibility,
but
we
have
no
license
to
impose
our
vision
of
the
future
on
our
300
million
fellow
citizens.
