mr.
kent
g.
holt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
below
falls
squarely
within
the
framework
of
roper
and
graham,
and
there
are
three
reasons
to
affirm
this
judgment.
first,
murder
is
the
worst
of
all
crimes.
society
has
drawn
that
line.
second,
legislatures
have
the
power
to
authorize
sentences
that
are
commensurate
with
crimes
like
murder.
third,
jackson
has
not
demonstrated
any
consensus
in
this
case
against
the
practice,
and
in
fact,
there
is
a
supermajority
of
states
and
of
governments
that
authorize
this
sentence.
the
landscape
of
this
case
is
--
is
different
than
graham,
because
in
graham
no
one
was
--
no
one
was
killed.
terrence
graham
was
lucky
no
one
was
killed,
because
he
acted
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
human
life
as
well,
but
it's
an
important
thing
in
our
law
that
the
law
punishes
the
--
the
result,
the
harm
that
is
inflicted.
and
if
i
could,
go
to
the
arkansas
statute.
jackson
was
charged
with
the
highest
crime
you
could
be
charged
with
in
arkansas,
it
was
capital
felony
murder.
in
that
the
legislature
has
set
out
several
enumerated,
several
violent
felonies
that
if
you
commit
this
particular
crime
--
and
aggravated
robbery
is
one
of
them
--
if
you
commit
that
crime
and
in
the
course
and
furtherance
of
that,
you
or
an
accomplice
act
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life
during
the
commission
of
it
or
in
the
flight
from
it,
then
you
are
guilty
of
capital
felony
murder.
so,
in
this
case
the
jury
was
called
upon,
because
there
were
other
accomplices
with
kuntrell
jackson,
they
were
called
on
to
determine
whether
or
not
kuntrell
jackson
acted
as
an
accomplice,
whether
he
aided
and
assisted
and
whether
or
not
he
or
an
accomplice
acted
with
extreme
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
in
that
process,
kuntrell
jackson
asserted
the
affirmative
defense
that
essentially
is
available
for
capital
murder.
he
said
that,
i
did
not
have
--
i
was
not
the
triggerman,
and
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
commit
the
homicide
offense,
and
i
did
not
aid
or
procure
counsel,
all
of
those
are
listed
--
the
exact
words
of
the
affirmative
defense
are
listed
in
our
brief
at
page
4.
and
--
but
he
asserted
that
defense.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
in
his
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
him
of
capital
murder
and
that
the
jury
was
well
within
its
right
to
believe
that
he
said
that
he
--
that
when
he
walked
in
and
took
--
took
the
lead
in
this
robbery
that
he
said,
"we
ain't
playing",
and
after
that
the
clerk
responded
that
she
was
going
to
call
the
police--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--of
capital
felony
murder,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
that's
correct.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
said
they
could
--
they
could
accept
that
as
--
they
pointed
to
that
as--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--as
a
possibility,
yes.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
no.
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
an
actual
finding--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--because
an
actual
--
in
regard
to
sentences
in
terms
of
years,
we
don't
require
that
individualized
responsibility
that
we
do,
for
instance,
in
a
death
penalty
case.
so--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--your
honor--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--yes.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
well,
your
honor,
that
--
that
--
telling
a
jury
about
that
doesn't
go
to
their
guilt.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
your
honor,
it's
--
a
legislative
judgment
has
been
made
with
regard
to
drawing
a
baseline
for
all
murderers,
whether
they
are
juvenile
murderers,
whether
they
are
get-away
drivers.
and
when
you
--
when
you
counsel
or
aid
or
do
anything
that
gets
you
liability
for
being
a
capital
murderer,
then
that's
the
--
that
is
the
minimum
sentence.
what
he
has
gotten,
on
account
of
his
youth,
is
he's
gotten
--
this
--
this
court
decided
in
roper
in
that
he
could
not
--
he
could
not
get
the
death
penalty.
all
of
those
individualized
characteristics
that
would
give
him
the
lesser
penalty,
he
doesn't
even
have
to
put
on.
it's
swept
off
the
table
because
he
is
not
exposed.
and
that
is
--
those
are
all
those
factors
in
terms
of
what
he
--
what
he
might
--
that
might
mitigate.
so
he
would
actually
would
sort
of
be
double
dipping
to
come
back
again
and
say,
oh,
and
by
the
way,
i'm
a
youth,
so
i
should
even
--
i
should
get
not
the
lesser
punishment,
i
should
get
the
lesser,
lesser
punishment.
so
there
is
a
certain
symmetry
that
this
case
has
with
the
graham
case,
in
that
the
graham
case
was
very
specific
about
the
way
it
defined
itself.
one
commentator
has
made
the
note
that
the
majority
opinion
in
graham
contained
the
word
non-homicide
47
times.
graham
essentially
said
what
it
wasn't.
it
wasn't
a
homicide.
it
was
that
other
line
that
society
draws
between
homicide
and
every
other
crime.
and
crimes
are
--
the
criminal
statutes
are
scalar.
there's
a
certain
amount
of
culpability
that's
built
into
each
one
of
those,
whether
it
be
capital
murder
or
first-degree
murder,
or
second-degree
murder.
and
it
does
go
on
what
you
know,
the
--
the
knowledge
that
you
have.
maturity
is
taken
into
consideration,
or
immaturity
is
taken
into
consideration
in
capital
murder
in
that
you
can't
get
the
worst
--
if
you've
been
shown
to
do
these
acts,
you
can't
get
the
worst
punishment.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
yes.
your
honor--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--yes.
your
honor,
arkansas
has
sort
of
a
three-tier
system.
the
age
for
moving
into
the
adult
system
is
14.
and
--
but
the
middle-tier
system
in
arkansas
is
called
extended
juvenile
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
particular
case
--
in
those
cases,
the
prosecutor
can
move
to
take
a
younger
age
and
put
in
--
and
it's
a
blended
sentence
between
the
--
and
a
youth
is
just
found
delinquent
of
a
crime
and
not
--
and
found
guilty.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
your
honor,
at
age
14
--
and
it's
the
specific
--
there
are
specific
crimes
that
a
prosecutor
would
move
a
case
into
an
adult
court.
it
is
the
prosecutor's
discretion
weighing
--
there
are
10
different
factors
that
include
the
severity
of
the
offense,
the
--
and
--
but
they
also
take
into
consideration
the
maturity
of
the
--
of
the
youth,
the--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--well,
there
is
discretion
up
front,
and
that
is
the
only
--
that
is
the
only
instance
when
a
defendant
can
actually
challenge
a
transfer,
where
a
prosecutor
decides
to
put
it.
but
there
are
also
--
so,
there
is
--
there's
discretion
at
the
front
end.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
well,
your
honor,
the
--
it
is
--
admittedly,
it
is
at
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor
on
those
ages
to
move
it
into
the--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
prosecutor
--
that
--
that
decision
to
move
it
in
there
is
challengeable.
it
is
reviewable
by
a
court.
he
moves
--
the
juvenile
moves
it
to
transfer
it
to
--
back
to
juvenile.
that
is
appealed.
that
was
done
in
this
case,
and
then
the
arkansas
court
of
appeals
reviewed
that
decision
and
said
that
the
court
--
the
court's
decision
was
not
erroneous.
so,
that
--
that
is
the
discretion
that
one
would
exercise
on
the
front
end.
again,
on
the
latter
end,
this
court
has
said
in
harmelin
that
the
individualized
sentencing
is
not
required,
and,
in
fact,
the
--
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
--
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
would
--
that
have
been
considered
because
it's
--
he's
--
the
death
penalty
has
been
taken
off
the
table.
that's
a
big
--
that's
a
big
deal,
especially
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
kuntrell
jackson
--
we
believe
the
evidence
showed
that
he
also
acted
with
reckless
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life,
based
--
based
on
the
evidence
in
this
case.
that
he
would
be
--
by
way
of
analogy,
that
he
would
be
a
tison
offender
himself.
but
irrespective
of
that,
the
legislature
in
arkansas
--
it's
--
the
legislative
judgment
has
been
that
the
minimum
sentence
that
a
person
can
receive
for
committing
a
capital
murder
in
arkansas
is
life
without
parole.
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
point
that
i
think
--
earlier
that
was
made.
the
two
other
individuals
in
this
particular
case
were
--
one
was
a
cousin
who
testified
against
mr.
jackson,
and
he
was
15.
he
had
turned
15
the
day
before
this
robbery.
and
the
second,
the
second
individual,
the
triggerman,
was
--
he
was
also
14,
and
he
received
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
as
well.
it's
our
position
that
--
as
is
alabama's,
that
the
main
--
the
principal
justification
in
this
case
lies
with
the
retributive
principle
that
society
needs
to
convey
the
message
that
people
that
laurie
--
that
laurie
troup's
life,
the
victim
in
this
case,
was
more
important
than
the
money
in
that
cash
register.
the
harm
here
was
irrevocable.
and
this
kind
--
the
punishment
for
this
--
it's
qualitative
--
death
--
the
death
penalty
is
qualitatively
different.
but
the
punishment
for
--
for
this
crime
reinforces
the
sanctity
of
human
life
and
it
expresses
the
state's
moral
outrage
that
something
like
this
could
happen.
we
think
that
the
respect
due
life
is
--
is
what
this
message
conveys,
and
it
conveys
it
more
as
a
life-without-parole
sentence
than
it
does
life
without.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
your
honor,
i'd
respectfully
disagree
that
he's
a
throwaway
person.
the
--
we
want
to
--
we
want
him
to
come
to
an
understanding
of
his
own
humanity.
we
want
him
to
realize
the
enormity
of
his
crime.
i
can
only
speak
for
arkansas,
but
in
arkansas,
instances
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
this
particular
petitioner,
jackson
has
made
efforts
to
obtain
his
ged;
he
has
taken
anger
management
classes.
you
can
--
juvenile
life
without
parole
--
people
serving
this
sentence
are
enrolled
in
vo-tech
programs
in
prison.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
excuse
me?
mr.
kent
g.
holt
your
honor,
he
has
--
the
hope
that
he
may
have
is
that
he
--
is
an
application
for
commutation
through
the
parole
board.
other
than
that,
he
will
--
or
perhaps
retroactive
legislation--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--if
the
legislature
comes
to
another
view.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
oh,
what
i'm
saying
is
the
parole
board
is
--
reviews
applications
for
commutation
in
arkansas.
so,
he
--
this
particular
petitioner
has
not--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
figures
on
that
--
on
how
many
per
year,
but
there
is
a
case
that
--
that
listed
--
it's
rogers
v.
state.
it
is
a
1979
case
that
actually
listed
--
30
clemency
requests
were
granted
in
the
last
5
years
from
that
opinion.
they
were
life
sentences.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
well,
life
without
--
life
and
life
without
parole
in
arkansas
are
the
same
type
of
sentence.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
yes,
your
honor.
laurie
troup
was
28
years
old
when
she
was
shot.
she
was
discovered
by
her
mother
and
her
11-year
old
son.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
that's
--
that's
not
a
view
that
--
that
i
know
that's
been
expressed.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
--
this
is
qualitatively
different.
and
--
and
that's
been
taken
off
the
table.
i
think
that
all
of
--
all
of
those
things
that
he
would
put
to
get
the
--
that
he
would
--
that
he
would
put
forward
to
get
the
lesser
sentence
is
--
initially
is
that
he
would
just
get
a
--
as
i
said,
a
lesser
--
lesser
sentence.
mr.
kent
g.
holt
your
honor,
the
only
provision,
and
--
and
this
does
go
to
show
that
arkansas
has
--
has
thought
about
this
in
ways
--
has
make
--
taken
deliberate
steps.
in
its
extended
juvenile
jurisdiction,
there
is
the
provision
that
--
that
a
--
for
instance,
a
14-year-old
in
this
particular
case,
if
--
if
they
had
deemed
that
they
would
go
in
extended
juvenile
jurisdiction
could
receive
a
life
penalty,
except
it
is
life
with
parole,
yes.
so,
that
is
--
that--
mr.
kent
g.
holt
--that's
not
available
to
an
adult.
no,
your
honor.
as
i
--
as
i
was
saying,
the
--
there's
a
certain
constitutional
symmetry
to
this
case
and
to
graham's
case
because
--
because
graham
committed
a
--
a
non-homicide
offense
and
he
was
a
youth,
and
so
he
had
twice-diminished
punishment.
but
he
only
received
one
diminishment
in
his
--
in
his
punishment,
because
he
had
--
he
was
--
he
had
twice-diminished
culpability.
in
this
particular
case,
jackson
does
not
have
twice-diminished
culpability.
he
has
--
he
is
a
youth.
even
if
he
were
to
--
even
if
we
were
to
say
that,
well,
he
didn't
pull
the
trigger,
or
we
can't
show
that
he
didn't
--
that
he
acted
--
didn't
act
with
reckless
indifference
--
even
if
we
were
to
say
that
that
was
twice-diminished,
he
is
still
criminally
responsible.
there's
not
a
--
there's
not
a
special
class
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
youth.
he
is
still
criminally
responsible
for
what
he
did.
and
--
and
a
teenager
--
teenagers
must
know
that
if
you
commit
the
worst
crime,
you
will
get
the
worst
punishment
that's
available
under
the
constitution.
and
so,
the
symmetry
here
is
that
--
that
terrence
graham
was
the
lucky
one.
it's
not
that
kuntrell
jackson
was
the
unlucky
one.
this
is
a
--
when
you
go
into
a
place
with
a
sawed-off
shotgun,
it's
a
dangerous
activity;
it's
inherently
dangerous.
and
what
was
left
out
of
the
calculus
a
minute
--
a
few
minutes
ago
was
the
fact
that
he
could
--
it's
not
just
kill
or
intend
to
kill,
but
foresee
what
could
happen.
and
certainly
the
evidence
in
this
case
demonstrated
that
kuntrell
jackson
could
foresee
that
at
an
armed
robbery,
someone
could
get
hurt.
and
that's
what
the
law
punishes,
is
the
result.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
