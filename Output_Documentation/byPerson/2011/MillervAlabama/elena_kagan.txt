justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
stevenson,
do
you
have
statistics
about
how
many
of
these
sentences
are
imposed
in
under
18-year-olds
in
nonmandatory
states?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
you
think
it
would
be
true,
going
up
to
age
18,
that
80-plus
percent
are
imposed
in
states
that
have
mandatory
systems?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
neiman,
i
wonder
if
we
can
go
back
to
the
issue
that
justice
breyer
left
on
the
table,
and
this
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
how
many
states
do
what,
but
instead
just
to
say
that
in
the
death
penalty
context,
we
have
insisted
on
individualized
sentencing.
and
in
graham,
of
course,
we
equated
juveniles
who
were
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
to
people
who
--
to
adults
who
were
sentenced
to
death
and
said
that
those
two
should
be
treated
equivalently.
and
i'm
wondering
whether
that
doesn't
suggest
that
the
rules
we
have
in
the
death
penalty
context
about
individualized
sentencing
ought
to
apply
to
juveniles
who
are
sentenced
to
life
without
parole?
justice
elena
kagan
regardless
of
how
many
states
do
what
and
how
many
times
this
happened,
but
just,
you
know,
two
facts.
we
have
insisted
on
this
in
the
death
penalty
context,
and
we
have
equated
the
death
penalty
context
to
juveniles
without
life
--
parole
in
graham.
justice
elena
kagan
but
harmelin
is
pre-graham,
and
in
graham
we
equated
these
two
things,
adults
sentenced
to
death
and
juveniles
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
fact
that
we
said
that
individualized
sentencing
was
not
enough
in
one
context
does
not
suggest
that
individualized
sentencing
ought
not
to
be
the
rule
in
a
different
context
where
there
is
no
categorical
bar.
justice
elena
kagan
when
you
look
at
those
two
cases
and
you
look
at
the
individuals,
the
child's
actions
in
the
two
cases,
they
really
are
remarkably
similar.
they're
sort
of
--
of
a
piece.
don't
you
agree?
i
mean,
how
is
it
that
the
child's
actions
in
this
case
were
any
different
from
that
in
graham?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
ginsburg
is,
of
course,
right.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
--
i'm
sorry;
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
state
makes
is
that
when
you
look
at
all
these
numbers,
the
number
that
is
most
different
between
this
pair
of
cases
and
graham
is
the
denominator.
and
i
am
wondering
whether
you
would
address
that.
what
kind
of
denominator
we
should
be
using
here
and
how
it
compares
to
the
denominators
that
we
have
used
in
past
cases.
justice
elena
kagan
in
each
of
these
two
cases,
a
14-year
old
was
convicted
of
murder.
petitioner
kuntrell
jackson
was
convicted
on
a
felony
murder
theory.
he
accompanies
two
other
boys
to
a
video
store
to
commit
a
robbery,
and
one
of
those
boys
shot
the
store
clerk.
petitioner
evan
miller
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
course
of
arson.
he
and
a
friend
beat
miller's
neighbor
with
a
bat
and
then
set
fire
to
his
trailer
after
an
evening
of
drinking
and
drug
use
with
the
victim.
both
boys
were
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
any
possibility
of
parole
under
statutes
that
made
that
sentence
mandatory.
we
hold
today
that
mandatory
sentences
of
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole
for
juveniles
violate
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
of
punishment.
that
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment
guarantees
individuals
the
right
to
be
free
from
excessive
sanctions
and
that
right
flows
from
what
we
have
called
a
basic
perceptive
justice.
the
punishment
for
crime
should
be
graduated
and
proportioned
to
both
the
offender
and
the
offense.
two
strands
of
precedent
applying
this
principle
lead
to
our
holding
today.
the
first
line
of
cases
has
emphasized
children's
lesser
culpability
and
greater
capacity
for
change
in
holding
that
certain
sentences
may
not
constitutionally
be
imposed
on
them.
in
roper
v.
simmons,
we
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
bars
capital
punishment
for
juveniles,
and
in
graham
v.
florida,
we
concluded
that
the
amendment
also
prohibits
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
for
a
juvenile
committed
of
--
convicted
of
a
nonhomicide
offense.
those
cases
demonstrate
that
the
differences
between
children
and
adults
diminish
the
justifications
for
imposing
the
harshest
sentences
on
juveniles
even
when
they
commit
truly
terrible
crimes.
and
most
fundamentally,
those
cases
make
clear
that
youth
matters
in
determining
the
appropriateness
of
certain
penalties,
that
imposition
of
a
state's
most
severe
penalties
on
juvenile
offenders
cannot
proceed
as
though
they
were
not
children.
our
decision
in
graham
also
likened
life
without
parole
for
juveniles
to
the
death
penalty
itself,
thus
evoking
a
second
line
of
our
cases.
in
those
decisions,
we
have
required
sentencing
authorities
to
consider
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
the
details
of
his
offense
before
imposing
the
death
penalty.
those
cases
too
repeatedly
emphasized
the
importance
of
considering
the
mitigating
qualities
of
youth
and
maturity,
impulsiveness,
failure
to
appreciate
risks
and
consequences
sometimes
terrible
yet
inescapable
family
circumstances
and
the
way
all
of
those
factors
may
relate
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
crime.
here,
the
confluence
of
these
lines
of
precedent
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
mandatory
life
without
parole
for
juveniles
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
the
states
contend
that
because
29
jurisdictions
make
life
without
parole
mandatory
for
some
juveniles
convicted
of
murder,
the
practice
must
be
constitutional,
we
disagree.
although
we
looked
to
such
numbers
in
considering
categorical
bars
to
a
punishment,
in
this
case,
we
do
not
erect
such
a
bar.
we
do
not
ban
life
without
parole
for
juveniles.
we
only
require
that
a
sentencer
consider
all
relevant
circumstances
before
imposing
it.
in
similar
situations,
this
court
has
not
counted
laws
in
the
way
the
states
here
propose.
further,
the
number
of
states
that
impose
mandatory
life
without
parole
is
actually
lower
than
the
number
we
considered
in
graham
allowing
life
without
parole
for
nonhomicide
crimes.
there,
39
jurisdictions
authorized
the
sentence
that
we
held
unconstitutional.
we
explained
in
graham
and
the
explanation
holds
just
as
through
here,
that
simply
tallying
the
number
of
states
that
impose
such
a
sentence
on
children
presents
a
distorted
view.
most
jurisdictions
have
never
passed
a
law
specifically
addressing
juvenile
life
without
parole.
instead,
those
sentences
result
from
two
separate
provisions
passed
at
separate
times;
one
that
simply
allows
juveniles
to
be
transferred
to
adult
court
and
another,
that
imposes
life
without
parole
on
anyone
convicted
there.
so
we
cannot
conclude
that
any
given
legislature
has
endorsed
this
penalty.
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
without
possibility
of
parole
for
juveniles
precludes
a
sentencer
from
taking
account
of
an
offender's
age
and
the
wealth
of
characteristics
and
circumstances
attendant
to
it.
under
those
schemes,
every
juvenile
receives
the
same
sentence
as
every
other,
the
17-year
old
and
the
14-year
old
and
for
that
matter,
the
10-year
old,
the
shooter
and
the
accomplice,
the
child
from
a
stable
household
and
the
child
from
a
chaotic
and
abusive
one
and
each
juvenile,
including
these
two
14-year
olds,
receives
the
same
sentence
as
the
vast
majority
of
adults
committing
identical
homicide
offenses.
preventing
judges
and
juries
in
that
way
from
thinking
about
all
of
the
differences
between
children
and
adults
and
among
particular
children
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
the
judgment
in
both
cases
is
reversed
and
remanded.
