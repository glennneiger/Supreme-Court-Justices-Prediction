mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
graham
v.
florida,
this
court
recognized
that
children
are
inherently
characterized
by
internal
attributes
and
external
circumstances
that
preclude
a
finding
of
a
degree
of
culpability
that
would
make
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
constitutionally
permissible
under
the
court's
eighth
amendment
excessiveness
analysis.
while
the
issue
in
graham
involved
juveniles
that
were
convicted
of
non-homicide
offenses,
these
deficits
in
maturity
and
judgment
and
decisionmaking
are
not
crime-specific.
all
children
are
encumbered
with
the
same
barriers
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
constitutionally
relevant
before
imposition
of
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
or
the
death
penalty.
in
fact,
in
roper,
this
court
acknowledged
that
these
differences
between
children
and
adults
exist
even
in
the
cases
involving
the
most
aggravated
murders.
these
deficits,
these
differences,
are
even
more
pronounced
in
young
children.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
there's
no
question,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
--
the
default
sentence
in
roper
was
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
but
we
actually
think
that,
specifically
with
regard
to
that
provision,
there
is
no
greater
deterrent
effect,
and
these
deficits,
that
these
problems
that
children
experience,
lend
themselves
to
an
analysis
that
is
subject
when
the
punishment
is
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
like
the
death
penalty--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--what
the
court
held
in
--
in
graham--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--justice
scalia,
i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
a
term
of
year
sentence
could
constitute
the
same
kind
of
judgment--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--as
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
but
there
is
a
distinction
obviously
between
life
imprisonment
without
parole
and
any
other
term
sentence.
those
sentences
in
most
instances,
if
the
sentence
is
not
too
extreme,
do
permit
the
possibility
of
release.
and
what
this
court
held
in
graham
is
not
that
the
state
forfeits
the
ability
to
incarcerate
for
life--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
and--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
there,
it
would
be
a
tough
case.
i
think
imposed
on
a
juvenile,
a
50-year
sentence--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--would
not
create
the
meaningful
possibility
of
release
that
this
court
ordered
in
the
graham
context.
it
would
be
right
on
the
line,
but
i
think
50
years
would
actually
be
on
the
other
side
of
a
meaningful
possibility
of
release.
it
would
be
sort
of
a
cynical
reaction,
if
this
court
were
to
say
we
ban
life
without
parole
for
these
kinds
of
offenders,
it
would
be
somewhat
problematic
to
suggest
that
we're
going
to
get
as
close
to
death
as
possible
and
then
facilitate
some
kind
of
review.
i
think
what
we're
interested
in--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
think
all
of
the--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
from
a
sentencing
perspective,
all
of
those
sentences
would
be
problematic.
but
the
distinction
between
a
14-year-old
and
a
15-year-old
for
constitutional
purposes
that,
of
course,
the
younger
you
are,
the
more
compelling
are
these
deficits,
these
distinctions,
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
what
i
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
that's
true.
but
of
course
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
and
in
the
other
case,
there
was
no
discretion
for
the
sentence.
neither
the
judge
nor
the
jury
could
give
any
effect
to
the
age
of
evan
miller,
who
was
14.
but
i
also
think
that
we've
identified
lots
of
laws
that
make
these
distinctions.
we
do
provide
for
greater
responsibilities--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that
would
not
satisfy
me,
justice
ginsburg,
for
all
the
reasons
that
this
court
acknowledged
in
graham.
that
--
that
the
problem
with
many
of
these
crimes
is
that
the
offense
itself
can
overwhelm
all
of
these
mitigating
factors,
all
of
these
aspects
of
juvenile
decisionmaking
that
we
think
are
constitutionally
permissible.
the
other
problem
is
that
we
still
can't
make
good
judgments
about
whether
a
child
--
whether
these
characteristics
are
transitory
or
permanent.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
think
it
would
be
principled
to
--
to
kind
of
strike
down
mandatory
sentences,
but
i
think
constitutionally
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
roper
and
in
graham,
that
it
would
be
a
--
a
mistake
to
equate
kids
with
adults.
and
we
don't
have
the
ability
to
make
those
judgments
even
if
we
create
a
different
kind
of
process.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
take
it
off
the
table;
i
just
mean
to
argue,
as
we
did
previously,
that
a
categorical
ban
would
be
consistent
with
the
court's
understanding
about
child
status
and
development.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
would
hold
that
children
are
categorically
prohibited
from
being
subjected
to
sentences--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
we've
presented
data
in
this
case
that
would
exclude
a
youth
14
and
younger.
no
state
that
has
set
a
minimum
age
for
life
without
parole
has
set
it
beneath
the
age
of
15,
other
than
one.
and
so,
we
--
we
would
make
that
holding.
i
do
think
it
would
be--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
i
would
also
hold,
your
honor,
that
a
mandatory
sentence
for
that
cohort
would
also
be
in
violation
of
this
eighth
amendment
principle.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
think
that
the
problem,
justice
ginsburg,
is
--
is
that
these
cases
with
the
mandatory
sentencing
aspects
to
them
create
kind
of
a
data
issue
that
this
court
has
usually
relied
on
to
kind
of
generate
an
interest.
i
think
right
now,
we
know
that
excluding
considerations
of
age
and
character
in
a
sentencing
determination
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
is
problematic.
the
court
in--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
--
i
would
draw
it
at
18,
justice
alito,
because
we've
done
that
previously;
we've
done
that
consistently.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
right,
for
the
same
reasons
that
we
made
that
determination
in
graham
and
that
the
court
made
that
determination
in
roper.
i
understand
that
there
are
some
tensions
when
we
draw
those
kinds
of
lines--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that
--
that
would
be
--
i'd
have
two
rules,
justice
sotomayor.
my
preferred
rule
would
be
a
categorical
ban
on
all
juveniles
under
the
age
of
18.
and
i
don't
want
to
retreat
from
that
in
any
way.
all
of
these
deficits,
all
of
these
characteristics,
that
we're
talking
about
have
been
recognized
to
apply
to
all
youth
up
until
the
age
of
18.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
it's
a
challenge,
and
i
--
and
i
concede
that.
but
i
--
so,
the
first
part
of
my
answer
would
be
that
i
think
the
easier
rule
to
write
would
be
that
there
is
a
categorical
ban
on
all
life
without
parole
sentences
for
all
children
up
until
the
age
of
18,
acknowledging--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
at
least
in
this
case,
you'd
look
to
your
precedent
in
roper
and
in
graham,
which
drew
that
line.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
understand--
[laughter]
i
understand,
justice
scalia,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
much
comfort
in
the
fact
that
39
jurisdictions
make
this
theoretically
possible.
that
same
number
existed
in
the
graham
context.
most
of
those
jurisdictions
have
not
addressed
a
minimum
age
for
life
without
parole.
in
fact--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
that
is,
what
the
state
permits
is
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
don't
think
we
can
read
into
a
transfer
judgment,
which
is
the
only
judgment
that
they've
made.
they've
said
that
some
children
of
some
age
can
be
treated
like
adults.
they
haven't
talked
about
what
that
--
what
the
punishment
should
be.
and
the
reason
why
i
say
that,
justice
alito,
is
that
in
many
of
these
states,
there's
no
minimum
age
for
trying
a
child
as
an
adult.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
they
--
they
have
not
considered
that
or
adopted
or
endorsed
it,
would
be
more
accurate.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
in
--
that
answer
--
that
number,
your
honor,
is
partly
rooted
in
the
fact
that
these
sentences
are
mandatory.
there
is
no
one
capable,
once
the
court
makes
a
decision
to
try
the
child
as
an
adult,
to
do
anything
to
consider
the
status
of
children.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
--
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there
are
any
legislatures
that
are
--
that
are
quick
to
make
their
sentences
less
--
more
compassionate,
more
responsive
to
--
to
juvenile
crime
of
any
sort.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
i
think
the
strength
of
my
argument,
justice
alito,
is
that
the
states
that
have
actually
considered,
discussed,
and
passed
laws
setting
a
minimum
age
for
life
without
parole
have
all
set
that
minimum
age
above
15.
that's
my
primary
argument.
thirteen
states
have
done
it;
all
of
them
except
for
one
have
set
it
at
18--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--there
is.
and
that's
because
the
--
the
transfer
question,
which
is
what
informs
whether
children
can
be
subject
to
these
sentences
or
not,
is
a
very
different
question.
it's
a
question
about
whether
the
juvenile
system
that
may
mandate
release
at
age
18
or
age
21
is
adequate
for
an
offender.
it's
not
a
judgment
that
that
child
should
therefore
be
subject
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
and
so,
you
have
this
disconnect.
you
have
transfer
judgments,
which
this
court
recognized
in
thompson
and
in
graham
were
not
proxies
for
sentencing
judgments.
and
because
of
that,
it
is
a
very
different
calculation.
the
second
point
is
that
if
there
is
no
minimum
age
for
trying
children
as
adults
or
even
prosecuting
children
as
adults,
i
think
we'd
have
to
concede
that
there
is
an
age
at
which
a
life
without
parole
sentence
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
for
any
crime.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
hasn't
addressed
that,
which
they
clearly
haven't
--
you
know,
in
this
cohort
of
79
children
with
life
without
parole
for
crimes
at
14
and
younger,
more
than
half
come
from
states
where
there's
no
minimum
age
for
trying
children
as
adults.
that
means
in
that
state,
a
10-year-old
child
would
arguably
have
been
contemplated
by
the
legislature
to
be
an
appropriate
person
for
life
without
parole,
or
an
8-year-old
child
and
a
6-year-old
child,
and
i
think
that
asks
too
much
of
these
statutes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
well,
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
what
this
court
has
relied
on
when
it
has
looked
at
these
numbers,
what
it
has
been
trying
to
figure
out,
are
these
objective
indicia
of
society's
standards,
its
mores,
its
decency
meter,
if
you
will.
and
we've
looked
at
these
numbers
to
inform
us,
are
these
sentences
that
are
--
that
are
consistent
with
evolving
standards
of
decency,
or
are
they
now
beyond
a
maturing
society?
and
we've
always
found
in
these
data
some
measures.
in
the
death
penalty
context,
we've
looked
at
that
in
the
roper
area,
in
the
atkins
area,
and
we've
been
able
to
make
some
judgments.
the
reason
why
we
could
do
it
in
these
death
penalty
cases
is
that
unlike
the
cases
here,
the
death
penalty
determination
is
discretionary.
the
sentencer
is
required
to
consider
and
evaluate
a
range
of
mitigating
circumstances
and
facts,
including
age,
that
help
us
assess
whether
the
determination
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment
means
something
in
a
society
still
trying
to
evolve.
here
that's
not
true.
the
majority
of
these
sentences
are
mandatory.
so,
the
number
tells
us
less
about
what
the
constitution
requires--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--the
--
the
data
on
the
larger
population
is
not
as
precise,
justice
kagan,
as
it
is
with
our
younger
population,
but
the
majority
of
states
are
mandatory
states,
and
the
estimates
are
about
that
85
percent
of
those
sentences
are
mandatory
sentences.
certainly,
the
states
that
have
the
largest
populations
--
michigan,
pennsylvania
--
these
states
have
mandatory
regimes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that
--
that's
correct.
and,
in
fact,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
those
sentences
come
from
a
handful
of
states
where
there
is
very
little
discretion
to
impose
a
sentence
other
than
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
and
because
of
that
feature,
i
don't
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
the
--
that
the
reliance
on
the
number
is
quite
as
powerful
here
as
it
has
been
in
the
death
penalty
context,
where
that
number
represented
a
very
communal
judgment
with
a
lot
of
factors.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
right.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
it
is,
for
the
very
reasons
that
the
court
articulates
in
both
roper
and
graham.
we're
not
arguing
that
life
without
parole
is
disproportionate
to
the
crime
of
aggravated
murder.
we're
arguing
that
the
status
of
children,
with
all
of
the
deficits
that
childhood
status
creates,
make
that
kind
of
judgment
cruel.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
think
one
of
the
problems,
your
honor,
with
--
with
trying
to
make
these
judgments
is
that
--
that
even
psychologists
say
that
we
can't
make
good
long-term
judgments
about
the
rehabilitation
and
--
and
transitory
character
of
these
young
people.
that's
the
reason
why
in
graham
this
court
didn't
permit
that
kind
of
discretion.
we
know
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
--
i
--
no.
i
think
it
would
still
be
relevant,
justice
scalia,
but
--
but
i
also
don't
think
that
correctional
facilities
have
identified
themselves
as
having
no
role
to
play
in
the
rehabilitative
process.
i
mean,
one
of
the
problems
with
this
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
is
that
it
actually
bans
and
shields
this
population
from
a
whole
range
of
services
that
are
specifically
designed
to
rehabilitate:
education
services,
treatment
services,
anger
management
programs.
all
of
these
programs
exist
within
prisons,
including
the
federal
prisons,
because
we
do
care
how
people
perform
when
they
are
released.
and
so,
corrections
is
still
very
much
the
heart
and
soul
of
what
we
do.
but
even
if
it
wasn't,
punishment
nonetheless
has
to
be
proportionate,
and
recognize
that
it
can
be
excessive.
and
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
when
you're
looking
at
children,
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
child
and
an
adult
would
be
cruel.
it
would
be
unfair
to
--
given
our
knowledge
and
understanding
of
what
developmental
science
has
taught
us
and
what
we
know
about
kids.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
--
i
don't
intend
to
abandon
it,
justice
kennedy.
i
mean,
obviously,
i'm
arguing
for
this
categorical
ban,
but
i
think
the
court
could
obviously
do
something
else.
we
think
that
there
is
a
basis
for
concluding,
unquestionably,
that
a
child
under
the
age
of
15
should
not
be
exposed
to
life
without
parole
based
on
this
court's
precedents
and
on
the
data
that's
presented.
the
court
could
set
a
categorical
line
there
and,
at
the
same
time,
make
a
determination
that
subjecting
any
child
under
the
age
of
18
to
life
without
parole
where
there
is
no
ability
to
consider
age
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
what
this
court
has
now
constitutionally
recognized
in
both
roper
and
graham.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no
plea
was
offered
to
miller.
the
--
what
tends
to
happen,
and
there
was
some
evidence
of
this
that
was
developed
earlier,
is
that
the
question
was
who
was
going
to
give
a
statement
first,
who
was
the
most
cooperative,
whose
lawyer
is
most
effective
at
accomplishing
that.
there
were
some
complaints.
there's
a
postconviction
pending
now
that
makes
some
allegations
about
what
the
lawyer
didn't
do
to
facilitate
a
plea.
but,
no,
there
was
no
offer
of
life
with
parole
made
to
evan
miller.
and
one
of
the
difficulties,
of
course,
in
these
cases
is
that,
you
know,
the
younger
you
are,
the
more
vulnerable
you
are,
the
less
experienced
you
are,
and
the
less
capable
you
are
of
managing
these
dynamics
in
the
criminal
justice
system
that
sometimes
can
be
very
outcome-determinative.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
no,
it's
very
hard
to
determine,
mostly
because
states
don't
keep
data--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--on
the
issue.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
they
might.
and
i
would
concede,
your
honor,
that
this
population
is
kind
of
less
equipped
to
make
determinations
about
whether
to
take
a
plea
or
whether
to
not
take
a
plea
than
an
adult.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
they
may
not
be,
your
honor,
but
we
haven't
found
sort
of
--
at
least
in
this
population,
any
evidence
that
they
are
capable
of
protecting
children
who,
we
believe
at
least,
should
be
protected.
and
one
of
the
interesting
things
at
least
looking
at
this
cohort
of
79,
a
great
number
of
them
have
older
codefendants.
both
of
the
kids
in
the
cases
before
the
court
today
have
older
codefendants
who
got
sentences
that
were
less
than
life
without
parole.
in
the
kuntrell
jackson
case--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that
--
that's
right.
although
in
some
of
these
cases
when
you
read
the
opinions,
you
do
see
the
evidence
of
the
shooter
not
getting
the
life
without
parole
sentence
and
the
accomplice
getting
it.
and
i
guess
my
point
would
be
is
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
it
did.
yes,
it
did.
and
my
point
would
be
that
it
--
this
younger
population
is
going
to
be
disadvantaged
in
managing
this
aspect
of
the
process
that
i
think
is
quite
important
when
the
court
is
trying
to
consider
whether
there
should
be
a
categorical
ban
or
something
less
than
a
categorical
ban.
and,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
cannot,
consistent
with
its
precedents,
make
a
categorical
ban
under
17.
but
i
also
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
if
the
court
can't
do
that,
that
there
aren't
ways
of
reconciling
the
precedents,
drawing
a
line
at
15
and
striking
down
mandatory
life
without
parole.
i
would
urge,
for
the
reasons
that
we've
stated,
that
in
these
circumstances
it's
better
to
have
a
sentence
where
you
can
make
a
judgment
about
rehabilitation
and
public
safety
later
in
life.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
state
has
to
give
away
the
authority
to
incarcerate
someone
even
for
the
rest
of
their
life
--
life
without
parole,
which
is
available
in
this
state,
alabama,
would
facilitate
that,
but
creates
a
meaningful
possibility
of
release
that
this
court
has
ordered
to
be
constitutionally
necessary
in
graham
v.
florida.
i
see
my
white
light
is
on.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
the
rule
we
seek
would
not
require
states
to
impose
the
same
sentence
on
juveniles
convicted
of
homicides
from
juveniles
convicted
of
non-homicides.
the
states
would
be
free
to
do
that
if
they
chose
to,
but
they
could
certainly
create
a
regime
where
it's
life
with
parole
where
there
are
different
ages
for
eligibility.
in
fact,
the
state
of
nevada
makes
you
eligible
for
parole
after
15
years
if
the
crime
is
a
non-homicide,
20
years
if
it's
a
homicide.
the
states
would
still
have
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
to
create,
consistent
with
this
court's
rule,
a
regime
that
makes
these
distinctions.
justice
kennedy,
i
did
want
to
point
--
direct
your
attention
to
two
amicus
briefs
that
i
think
respond
to
two
of
the
questions
you've
raised.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
submitted
by
criminologists
in
this
case,
and
it
looks
specifically
at
the
question
of
deterrence.
and
what
they've
found
is
life
without
parole
has
not
had
any
measurable
deterrent
effect.
the
states
that
don't
put
juveniles
--
don't
subject
children
to
life
without
parole
have
actually
experienced
the
same
level
of
decrease
in
violent
crime
and
homicide
as
the
states
that
do.
and
in
fact,
in
some
of
those
jurisdictions,
the
decrease
is
even
more
significant.
i
also
want
to
address
your
question,
justice
scalia.
there
is
--
there
are
some
studies
that
have
established
that
juveniles
are
more
likely
or
less
likely
to
recidivate
after
an
intervention
than
adults.
generally
speaking,
homicide
offenders
are
categorically
less
likely
to
recidivate
than
many
non-homicide
offenders.
drug
offenders
and
property
crime
offenders
are
much
more
likely
to
recidivate
than
--
than
homicide
offenders.
and
so
there's
a
lot
to
support
that
a
judgment
rooted
in
these
penological
concerns
would
be
well-supported
here.
i
also
want
to
return,
justice
breyer,
to
your
question.
mr.
neiman
has
--
argued
that
we
can
read
into
these
statutes
a
commitment
to
imposing
life
without
parole
at
a
particular
age,
and
that
age
is
the
age
of
transfer.
i
just
want
to
highlight
that
the
two
states
with
the
largest
populations
of
juveniles
serving
life
without
parole
by
a
huge
margin
are
pennsylvania
and
michigan,
neither
of
which
has
a
minimum
age.
that
means
in
those
states,
a
child
of
any
age
can
be
subject
to
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
without
parole.
it's
simply
not
true
--
true
that
we
can
read
into
those
statutes
in
those
jurisdictions
any
kind
of
conscious
commitment
to
thinking
about
age.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
--
i
think
that
they
haven't
thought
about
it.
yes,
i
do
think
that.
i
mean,
for
example
--
this
goes
to
the
next
point
i
was
about
to
make
--
my
colleague
keeps
talking
about
aggravated
murder.
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
it's
not
just
aggravated
murder
that
subjects
you
to
a
mandatory
life
without
parole;
if
you're
convicted
of
second-degree
murder
--
no
intent
--
diminished
--
it's
still
mandatory
life
without
parole.
we
have
14-year-old
children
--
and
again,
that's
the
largest
cohort
in
our
group
--
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
convicted
of
clearly
unintentional
killings
that
have
been
subject
to
mandatory
life
without
parole.
south
dakota
does
the
same
thing.
i
think,
where
there
is
no
minimum
age
and
where
you
have
that
kind
of
regime,
i
cannot
--
i
don't
think
we
can
conclude
that
they've
thought
about,
yes,
it's
appropriate--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
i--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
i
--
i
don't
think
it
changes,
because
there
is
an
age
at
which
this
court
is
obligated
under
the
eighth
amendment
to
say
a
sentence
of
this
sort,
a
permanent
judgment
that
life-long
incarceration
is
--
is
required--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
well,
in
--
in
that
regard,
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
we
do
have
13
states
that
have
thought
about
it,
that
have
expressly
looked
at
this
question
of
what
the
minimum
age
should
be.
and
in
12
of
those
13
states
that
have
set
the
age
above
14,
most
of
those
states
have
set
the
age
at
18.
so
if
that's
the
court's
lens,
then
i
think
that
would
support
the
kind
of
rule
that
we're
seeking
here--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
i
think
that's
in
part--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--it
might
be
more
democratic,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
constitutional
obligation
that
this
court
has
to
protect
people
who
are
vulnerable
from
excessive
punishment.
and
this
is
a
cohort
that
we
contend
is
the
most
vulnerable
and
should
be
shielded
from
this
excessive
punishment.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
haven't.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
--
yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
i
--
i
think
you
--
you
could
do
that.
in
fact,
in
graham,
the
court
makes
these
statements
that
they're
trying
to
exempt
and
shield
juveniles
who
did
not
kill,
quote,
"or
did
not
intend
to
kill.
"
and
that
language
could
be
a
basis
for
organizing
the
court's
thinking
on
this
issue.
and,
obviously,
in
this
case
where
there
wasn't
a
requirement
of
the
specific
intent
to
kill
that
was
required
in
the
alabama
case,
that
--
that
might
dictate
a
certain
different
outcome.
i
think
the
challenge
with
that
is
that
juvenile
status,
juvenile
intent,
is
a
much
more
complicated
issue,
and
that
for
many
of
the
same
reasons
that
are
problematic
with
how
kids
function
at
the
first
stage
of
these
trials,
it
would
be
hard--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that
--
that's
right.
but--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
i
hear--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--i
think
there
is
no
question,
justice
sotomayor,
there
would
be
more
justification
for
those
crimes
where
there
is
an
intent
to
kill,
because
this
court
in
its
jurisprudence
had
recognized
that
kind
of
hierarchy
which
you've
outlined
and
is
exhibited
in
enmund
and
then
in
the
court's
other
cases.
now,
it's
true
that
in
--
in
arkansas
under
this
provision
an
adult
would
still
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty,
because
they
used
this
"recklessness"
language
so
that
even
a
focus
on
"intent
to
kill"
that
we
addressed
in
enmund
might
not
categorically
protect
these
other
juveniles,
which
i
think
the
court
can
rightly
acknowledge
have
diminished
culpability.
it's
also
worth
noting
that
in
many
of
these
states
where
there
are
children
being
sentenced
to
life
without
parole,
there
is
no
confusion
about
this.
they
are
being
convicted
of
homicide
offenses
for
which
there
is
no
intent
to
kill.
no
dispute.
those
jurisdictions,
those
provisions
would
likely
be
addressed
by
the
enmund
analysis.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
it
would
--
you're
absolutely
right
that
it's
felony
murder,
but
it's
a
little
different.
in
arkansas,
if
you
cooperate
or
give
aid
to
someone
who
commits
a
crime,
even
if
it's
not
intentional,
if
it's
a
reckless
indifference
to
life,
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
what
is
capital
felony
murder.
and
the
arkansas
court
has
interpreted
that
to
mean
for
an
adult
you'd
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
and
here
kuntrell
jackson
was
subject
to
life
without
parole.
the
state
argues
that
there
was
support
for
that
and
even
some
kind
of
intent,
because
there
was
a
dispute
about
the
words
--
just
quickly,
you
know,
these
three--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that
--
that's
exactly
right.
and
the
dissenters
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
relied
on
that
in
making
the
determination
that
they
did
not
conclude
that
intent
had
been
established
here
in
a
way
that
would
support
the
judgment
that
--
that
we
seek.
but
that
goes
back
to
one
of
the
earlier
questions
that
was
posed
about
what
happens
at
the
guilt
phase.
is
it
--
justice
kennedy,
it
is
true
that
in
alabama
and
in
most
jurisdictions,
you
would
not
be
permitted
to
tell
the
jury
what
the
sentencing
outcome
would
be.
and
in
many
of
these
cases
there
--
there
isn't
a
lesser
included.
that's
going
to
be
up
to
the
--
to
the
prosecution
in
--
in
some
of
these
crimes.
and
there
are
a
range
of
offenses
for
which
that
would
not
help
a
jury
kind
of
deal
with
the
--
the
kind
of
--
the
choice
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--it
--
it
would
really
depend,
justice
alito,
on
the
facts.
for
example,
one
of
our
provisions
in
alabama
makes
the
--
the
crime
sort
of
a
--
a
homicide
a
capital
crime
if
the
victim
is
under
the
age
of
14.
you're
not
entitled
to
some
diminished
culpability,
some
other
kind
of
homicide
charge
unless
there's
something
else
going
on
that
would
support
that.
our
laws
and
this
court's
law
say
there
has
to
be
evidence
in
support
of
that
lesser
included
instruction
before
the
court
is
constitutionally
obligated
to
provide
it.
and
so,
for
that
reason,
it's
not
a
given
that
that
would
happen.
and
i
think
the
challenge
with
the
mandatory
scheme
that
we've
been
talking
about
in
both
of
these
cases
is
that
it
does
put
the
sentencer
in
a
very
difficult
situation,
where
there
is
no
ability
to
consider
the
age;
there
is
no
ability
to
consider
the
factual
diminished
culpability
that
might
exist
in
one
case
or
the
other;
no
ability
in
either
of
these
cases
to
consider
the
fact
that
an
older
codefendant
got
a
lesser
sentence.
that
there
is
something
else
going
on
here
that
--
that
goes
beyond
just
the
particulars
of
this
crime
and
this
particular
offender's
culpability.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
it's
a
reckless
indifference
to
life.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
and
if
he
gave
aid
or
assistance
to
someone
in
that
capacity,
and
the
question,
justice
breyer,
turned
on
--
on
this
statement
made
that
the
--
the
codefendant
who
testified
against
kuntrell
jackson--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--initially
told
the
police
he
--
that
he
came
in
and
said
we
ain't
playing,
and
then
he
testified
that
he
said,
"i
thought
y'all
were
--
were
playing.
"
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes,
and
that's
what
the
state
argued
here,
is
that
the
fact
that
he
had
knowledge
of
this
gun
and
that
they
went
in
there
made
him
guilty
of
reckless
indifference
even
though
it
didn't
create
the
kind
of
intent
to
kill
that
--
that
we
typically
require
for
these
kinds
of
showings.
that's
again
why
there
was
the
significance
around
this
language,
that
if
you
come
in
and
you
say
something
declaratory
that
suggests
that
it's
directed
at
the
victim,
it
might
help
kind
of
support
that
intent
finding
if
you
don't--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
what
--
what
the
court
does--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that
--
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
and,
again,
i
think
that
this
court
knows
its
own
precedents,
but
as
you'll
recall,
tison
followed
enmund,
and
in
tison
v.
arizona
is
when
the
court
allowed
there
to
be
this
kind
of
room
around
this
intent
standard
in
the
way
that
you
just
described.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
again,
my
--
i
would
--
i
would
categorically
prohibit
no
matter
what
the
intent
is.
i
think
particularly
for
children
at
this
age.
what
i
think
this
case
highlights,
what's
meant
by
"i
thought
you
all
were
playing.
"
versus
"we
ain't
playing"
isn't
a
very
good
indicator
of
whether
someone
should
be
subject
to
life
without
parole.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
i
--
i
think
the
evidence--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yes.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
i
think
the
evidence
that
would
support
a
finding
of
aggravated
murder
would
obviously
be
stronger,
but
even
there
--
and
this
is
what
the
court
points
out
in
--
in
roper,
the
--
the
decisionmaking
of
children,
that
the
thinking
of
children
is
categorically
different.
they're
not
thinking
three
steps
ahead;
they're
not
thinking
about
consequences;
they're
not
actually
experienced
enough
with
the
world
to
understand
how
they
deal
with
their
frustrations
in
the
same
way
that
an
adult
is.
and
so,
their
judgments
about
what
they
intend
to
do,
their
declarations,
mean
something
very,
very
different.
and
one
of
the
factors
that
we
haven't
talked
about,
but
i
just
want
to
emphasize,
is
it's
not
just
their
inherent
internal
attributes;
it's
also
the
external
circumstances
that
they
find
themselves
in.
kuntrell
jackson
was
born
in
a
household
where
there
was
nothing
but
violence
and
guns
and
people
shooting
each
other.
his
grandmother
shot
his
uncle.
his
mother
shot
a
neighbor.
his
brother
shot
someone.
they
were
all
put
to
jail.
but,
unlike
an
adult,
these
children
don't
have
the
ability
to
escape.
a
child
of
14
cannot
leave
his
criminogenic
or
violent
environment.
they
have
no
control
over
that.
and--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--and
just
because
of
that,
i
think
it
does
reinforce
why
even
their
judgments,
their
so-called
intentional
judgments,
reflect
a
very
different
kind
of
understanding
of
their
character,
their
potential
for
rehabilitation,
than
it
would
with
an
adult.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
i
think,
first
of
all,
it
is
true
that
homicide
offenses
are
less
common
than
non-homicidic
offenses.
in
graham,
this
court
looked
at
a
range
of
non-homicide
crimes,
and
that
was
a
huge
number,
300,000,
that's
largely
because
we
were
talking
about
a
multitude
of
offenses
and
here
we
are
talking
about
a
single
offense.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
have
been
7,000
children
arrested
for
homicide
and
non-negligent
murder
--
manslaughter,
over
this
40-year
time
period
and
only
79
children
have
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
is
a
significant
fact
that
reinforces
our
claim
that
this
is
a
very
rare
sentence.
that
is
1
percent.
and
the
fact
that
it's
over
40
years,
that's
also
true
for
the
79.
we
got
to
that--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--that's
right.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
alito,
on
the
first
point,
that
these
are
arrest
data.
of
course,
that's
what
we
used
in
graham,
because
again
in
this
cohort,
conviction
data
is
simply
very
difficult
to
get.
but
it's
not
true
that
only
children
arrested
for
aggravated
murder
are
subject
to
life
without
parole.
as
i
have
mentioned,
in
the
states
that
create
the
largest
population
of
these
kids,
all
kinds
of
homicide
can
subject
you
to
life
without
parole.
so
it
is
true--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--in
some
states,
yes.
that
is
to
the
extent
that
you
get
convicted
of
murder
some
of
these
states,
south
dakota
and
pennsylvania
come
to
mind,
whether
it's
first
degree
or
second
degree,
you
are
subject
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole
and
it
is
a
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
not
in
all
states,
that's
true.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yes.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--well,
we
can't
get
beyond
what
the
data
tell
us.
but
i
want
to
suggest
it's
no
less
precise
than
what
this
court
had
to
deal
with
in
graham.
in
graham,
we
talked
about
380,000
non-homicide
offenders.
half
of
that
class
were
people
convicted
of
drug
crimes,
which
no
one
has
suggested
would
subject
you
to
life
without
parole.
another
60,000
were
convicted
of
assaults
and
kids
get
into
fights
all
the
time.
but
we
used
the
aggregate
of
all
of
those
numbers
when
we
made
that
comparison.
so
i'd
actually
argue
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
category
definition
that
is
much
more
precise
than
what
we
dealt
with
in
graham.
and,
justice
kagan,
to
return
to
your
question
we
do
have
some
precedence
that
help
us
with
this.
in
coker
v.
georgia,
this
court
was
trying
to
make
an
assessment
about
the
propriety
of
the
death
penalty
for
the
crime
of
rape.
and
what
the
court
noted
was
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
jury
that
made
decisions
about
life
versus
death
chose
life.
and
there
we
were
talking
about
a
death
rate,
if
you
will,
of
10
percent.
here,
with
a
larger
universe,
we
are
talking
about
a
rate
of
1
percent.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
yeah.
i
think
two
nonrandom
arguments
can
be
made
for
the
two
ages.
i
will
start
with
the
young
age
of
14.
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
13
jurisdictions
have
thought
about
this,
and
have
all
but
one
set
the
age
above
14,
i
think
we
can
then
rely
on
that
to
make
a
determination
that
if
there
is
a
minimum
age,
it's
above
14.
i
think
we
can
also,
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents,
look
at
the
frequency
of
the
sentence
for
this
population.
most
states
have
never
sentenced
a
child
to
life
without
parole
for
a
crime
at
14.
they've
just
never
done
it.
32
states,
there
are
no
children
14
and
younger
serving
life
without
parole.
and
so,
i
think
that
allows
this
court
in
a
very
nonrandom
way
to
defend
that
judgment.
but
i
also
think
a
nonrandom
argument
can
be
made
to
draw
the
line
at
18.
that
is
offenders
under
the
age
of
18.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
has
done
in
roper,
it's
what
this
court
has
done
in
graham.
what
we
have
relied
on
about
juvenile
status
is
applicable
to
that
poll.
i
concede
that
these
other
indicia
are
not
quite
as
compelling.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
that's
right--
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
--yeah,
but
i
guess
just
on
that
point,
justice
breyer,
i
think
you're
right
that
the
indicia
are
more
complicated.
but
i
want
to
just
stress
that
they
are
less
meaningful
here.
because
with
mandatory
sentences,
they
don't
tell
you
the
same
thing
they
do
in
these
other
contexts.
but
i
also
think
it's
true
that
we
have
recognized
that
up
until
the
age
of
18,
you
are
a
juvenile,
your
status
is
coherent
with
what
the
court
has
recognized
in
these
other
cases.
and
so
i
do
think
it's
defensible
there.
while
it's
true
that
you
are
more
developed
than
a
child
of
14
or
a
child
of
10,
it's
also
true
that
you
are
not
an
adult.
and
we
make
that
distinction
in
lots
of
ways.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
well,
yes,
this
court
in
thompson
made
a
distinction
between
offenders
that
were
under
the
age
of
15,
15
and
younger,
then
older
offenders.
and
for
20
some
years,
the
law
in
this
country
was
you
could
not
subject
younger
offenders
to
the
death
penalty
in
ways
that
you
could
older
offenders.
and
so
there
is
clearly
precedent
for
that
and
we
have
appended
also
lots
of
statutes,
i
mean,
that
also
make
those
kinds
of
distinctions.
i
mean,
we
do
draw
these
lines
frequently
in
a
range
of
areas,
not
just
dealing
with
the
constitutional
questions
that
we
are
dealing
with
here.
but
just
kind
of
to
complete
my
analysis,
justice
kagan,
about
these
comparisons.
the
other
point
that
i
will
reference
is
that
in
thompson,
this
court
was
also
struggling
over
this
question
about
frequency
and
rarity.
and
what
the
court
did
there
was
actually
look
at
the
number
of
juveniles
that
were
sentenced
to
death
under
the
age
of
16
that
were
on
death
row
and
compared
them
to
the
number
of
people
on
death
row
at
the
time,
and
they
noted
that
it
was.36
percent
of
the
population
of
people
on
death
row.
if
you
did
the
same
thing
here,
the
sentencing
project
reports
that
there
are
over
41,000
people
in
the
united
states
serving
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
and
if
you
compare
our
number
of
79
to
that,
that
is
actually
again
a
lower
proportion
of
people
serving
life
without
parole
than
the
court
found
to
be
constitutionally
significant
in
thompson.
so
i
think
thompson
and
coker
all
reinforce
what
we
are
saying
here,
that
this
is
an
exceedingly
rare
sentence
where
the
majority
of
states
have
never
chose
to
impose
it.
that
would
provide
a
basis
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
it
is
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
no,
no,
i
--
i
--
i
don't
intend
to
do
that
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
a
distinction,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
stronger
argument
that
by
traditional
measures
there
is
lower
culpability
in
kuntrell
jackson's
case.
he
was
not
found
to
have
specifically
intended
to
kill.
in
the
state
of
alabama
he
could
not
have
been
subject
to
life
without
parole,
and
there
are
states
where
he
would
not
be
subject
to
that,
based
on
his
degree
of
culpability.
i
--
i
guess
my
--
my
--
my
point
is
that
even
there,
there
is
a
challenge
that
if
the
court
wants
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
thinking,
what
children
intend
because
they
are
children
is
a
very
complicated
question.
it's
a
very
different
question.
i
don't
mean
to
concede
that
it's
an
irrelevant
question.
i
think
the
court
absolutely
can
and
should
conclude
that
there
is
diminished
culpability
in
the
jackson
case,
and
that
is
evident
based
on
the
facts
in
the
crime.
actually
it
was
the
dissenter
in
--
in
the
jackson
case
that
made
this
observation
about
the
consequences
of
crime.
and,
of
course,
for
many
non-homicide
crimes
there
are
these
kind
of
fortuities
that
sometimes
prevent
death
wonderfully,
and
we
were
grateful
for
that.
my
problem
is
that
the
differences
between
children
and
adults,
these
internal
attributes,
if
you
will,
these
deficits
in
judgment
are
not
crime
specific.
the
person
who
intends
to
kill
doesn't
actually
have
any
better
judgment,
any
more
character,
any
more
maturity,
any
more
impulse
control
than
the
person
who
doesn't.
and
a
way
of
characterizing
a
rule
would
be
to
recognize
that
and
to
create
a
categorical
ban.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bryan
a.
stevenson
just
--
just
a
few
points.
justice
kennedy,
i
just
want
to
kind
of
remark,
there
is
some
literature
out
there
about
commutation
in
arkansas.
and
it
was
actually
quite
common
up
until
1980,
and
this
case
that
my
colleague
referenced
was
prior
to
that
date.
but
since
then,
it's
been
very
uncommon.
there's
only
been
one
commutation
since
2007
with
the
current
governor,
and
that
was
for
a
non-homicide
offense.
i
--
i
also
want
to
say,
but
just
kind
of
consistent
with
my
earlier
argument,
that
this
court
did
strike
down
mandatory
death
sentences
in
woodson
v.
north
carolina
and
roberts
v.
louisiana
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
has
highlighted
here
that
made
that
sentence
unconstitutional
and
inappropriate.
and
we
think
that
in
the
same
way,
the
court
could
certainly
do
that
here.
but
my
final
point
is
really
to
just
say
we
are
not
suggesting
that
states
should
not
be
able
to
impose
very
harsh
punishments
and
very
severe
sentences
on
even
children
who
commit
these
kinds
of
violent
crimes.
that's
not
our
position.
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
state
of
alabama
have
parole
boards
in
place.
they
can
even
impose
sentences
that
give
them
the
authority
to
maintain
control
of
the
lives
of
these
children
for
the
rest
of
their
natural
lives.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
they
cannot
do
so
with
no
hope
of
release,
that
that
would
be
incompatible
with
child
status.
and
that's
the
rule
of
roper.
that's
the
logic
of
roper
and
graham.
it
could
be
argued
that
every
person
is
more
than
the
worst
thing
they've
ever
done.
and
a
policymaker
and
a
decisionmaker
might
consider
that
in
constructing
what
kind
of
sentences
to
impose
and
what
kind
of
regime
to
create,
and
that's
totally
up
to
the
legislatures.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
children
are
uniquely
more
than
their
worst
act.
they
are
quintessentially
children
in
a
way
that
the
constitution
requires
that
we
respect
their
child
status.
and
our
argument
is
simple.
our
argument
is
that
it
would
be
unusual
to
recognize
that
in
virtually
every
area
of
the
law
but
when
a
crime
is
committed,
to
simply
abandon
it,
to
simply
ignore
it.
roper
and
graham
teach
us
that
we
can't
do
that
consistently
with
our
eighth
amendment
prohibitions.
and
so,
for
that
reason,
it
is
unusual,
and
it's
our
judgment
that
it
would
be
cruel
to
declare
these
children
fit
only
to
die
in
prison
given
what
we
now
know
about
their
status,
about
their
development,
and
about
their
potential.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
lower
court
judgments
and
grant
relief
in
this
case,
jackson
v.
arkansas.
