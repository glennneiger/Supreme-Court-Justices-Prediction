justice

bader

mr.
stevenson,
but
in
roper,
the
court
also
made
the
point
--
when
it
ruled
out
the
death
penalty,
it
said,
"to
the
extent
the
juvenile
death
penalty
might
have
residual
deterrent
effect,
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
is
itself
a
severe
sanction.
"
so,
the
court
in
roper
seemed
to
be
anticipating
this
case
and
suggesting
that
--
that
it
was
all
right,
it
was
constitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
satisfy
you
if
the
--
if
it
were
not
a
mandatory
term
and
it
was
left
to
the
trier
to
put
--
put
in
all
the
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
could
say
you
reserve
that
question
for
another
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stevenson,
may
i
ask
you
a
case
--
a
question
specifically
about
the
miller
case?
there
were
two
boys
involved
in
this
horrendous
crime.
the
older
one
took
a
plea
and
got
life
with
parole.
was
the
plea
offered
to
miller?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
--
was
it
a
factor
in
miller's
case?
was
there
a
lesser
--
lesser
offense
that
was
charged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was
--
the
--
there
was
also
a
felony
murder
charge
in
the
miller
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
take
into
account,
when
the
--
the
child
is
in
the
juvenile
system
initially,
has
to
be
moved
to
the
adult
system.
is
the
judgment
--
is
there
any
cutoff
on
the
transfer?
or
can
a
child
be
transferred
to
the
adult
system
at
any
age?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
are
under
14,
you
can't
be
transferred
out
of
the
juvenile
system?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
were
only
13,
he
would
get
out
when?
when
he
was
21?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
in
--
in
the
jackson
case.
in
the
jackson
case,
the
crime
was
very
similar
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
making
an
argument
now
in
jackson's
case.
jackson
was
the
felony
murder
case
and
i
think
at
least
in
your
brief,
you
made
the
argument
it
was
just
happenstance
and
bad
luck
that
in
jackson's
case
the
shop
attendant
was
killed.
and
in
graham's
case,
the
person
who
was
assaulted
survived.
but
your
argument
to
us
seems
to
make
no
distinction
between
the
two
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
standard
in
arkansas
for
moving
a
child
from
the
juvenile
system?
we
heard,
i
think,
in
alabama
it
was
--
was
age
13?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
age
12.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
the
sanctity
of
human
life,
but
you're
dealing
with
a
14-year-old
being
sentenced
to
life
in
prison,
so
he
will
die
in
prison
without
any
hope.
i
mean,
essentially,
you're
making
a
14-year-old
throwaway
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
because
arkansas
has
no
life
with
parole?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
available
to
an
adult.
that's
only
available
to--
