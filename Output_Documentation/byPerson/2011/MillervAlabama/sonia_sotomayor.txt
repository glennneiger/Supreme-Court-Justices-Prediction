justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
just
said
a
second
earlier
that
you
had
a
bifurcated
rule:
no
life
without
parole
whatsoever
for
15
and
under,
and
no
mandatory
life
for
16
--
15
and
over.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
write
the
opinion
to
do
the
bifurcated
rule?
what
justifies
an
absolute
ban
at
a
certain
age
and
a
modified
ban
above
an
age,
and
how
do
you
deal
with
harmelin
with
respect
to
the
second
part
of
your
rule--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
harmelin
says
we
don't
look
at
individualized
sentencing?
so,
how
do
we
get
rid
of
the
mandatory
if
that's
what
we're
were
going
to
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
no
question
that
you're
dealing
with
a
much
smaller
universe
of
children
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
who
are
14
and
under.
there's
an
argument
that
that's
because
so
few
of
them
commit
the
crimes.
but
putting
that
aside,
the
universe
is
rather
small.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right?
there
is
a
much,
much
larger
group,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
for
life
without
parole
for
juveniles
at
15
and
above.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
go
back
to
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
need
an
answer
to
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is,
assuming--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
bifurcated
theory
that
you
proffered,
tell
me
how
we
get
around
harmelin.
how
would
you
write
that
decision?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
wasn't
a
majority
in
theory
in
harmelin,
and
--
but
at
least
three
justices
spoke
about
a
gross
disproportionality.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
your
views
that
life
--
a
mandatory
life
without
parole
for
someone
like
a
juvenile
is
grossly
disproportionate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
happened
in
jackson.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--actually,
i
do
want
to
ask,
and
it
dovetails
with
what
justice
breyer
is
asking,
the
edmund/tison
line
for
adults,
which
is
we
can't
execute
someone
who
hasn't
killed,
intended
to
kill
or
was
reckless
in
killing.
this
is
a
question
more
in
the
jackson
case,
because
i
think
it's
an
issue
there.
but
although
all
murder
is
heinous
and
regrettable,
there
are
different
kinds
of
murder.
that's
why
some
people
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty
and
others
are
not.
and
i
do
see
a
world
of
difference
between
the
miller
killing
and
the
jackson
killing,
vis-a
--
vis,
the
individual
defendants'
personal
liability.
so,
assuming
there
are
different
kinds
of
--
of
killings
--
of
murder,
should
we
be
looking
at
the
edmund/tison
line
at
all?
should
we
be
talking
about
its
application
to
juveniles
in
a
different
way?
edmund/tison
basically,
okay,
felony
murder
if
you
know
that
there's
a
gun
involved,
but
should
that
line
be
the
same
for
juveniles?
and,
if
so,
then
how
do
you
go
back
to
justifying,
as
justice
breyer
spoke
about,
the
mandatory
nature
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
given
that
not
every
juvenile
is
equal
and
not
every
murder
is
equal
with
respect
to
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
not
an
individual
legislative
determination.
that
is
--
that
is
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
start
--
i
know
that
enmund
and
tison
has
to
do
with
death
eligibility
with
respect
to
adults,
but
it
does
draw
a
line
between
death
eligibility
with
respect
to
intentionality
or
not,
or
recklessness.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
some
of
us
might
be
interested
in
whether
a
line
should
be
created
for
juveniles
who
intended
or
didn't
intend
death,
with
respect
to
their
eligibility
for
life
without
parole,
whether
it's
mandatory
or
voluntary,
how
would
we
write
that?
would
--
would
we
just
import
all
the
enmund
and
tison
jurisprudence?
or
would
we
say
something
different
with
respect
to
juveniles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
has
to
do
with
your
general
rule,
which
--
which
we
shouldn't
impose
it
at
all.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
if
we
go
even
to
your
second
step
rule--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assuming
we
bifurcate--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--then
--
then
we
still
have
the
question
of
when
do
we
permit
a
mandatory
imposition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
fact,
jackson
was
convicted
with
a
nonintent,
just
a
felony--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
doesn't
matter.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
jury
didn't
have
to
--
all
the
jury
found
was
that
he
didn't
meet
his
affirmative
burden
of
proving.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
didn't
counsel
--
they
didn't
make
a
finding--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
to
what
words
were
used
and
what
the
intent
was.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
reckless
indifference
means
that.
meaning
if
he
knew
they
were
carrying
guns,
doesn't
that
make
him
liable
for
the
reckless
indifference--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
he
thought
they
would
use
them
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
--
i
--
i
know
that
this
seems
like
block
building,
but
i
--
i
think
of
law
as
sort
of
logical.
if
you
are
involved
in
a
felony,
and
you
counsel
the
felony
where
someone
dies
under
arkansas
law,
you
are
guilty
of
felony
murder,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
whether
or
not
that
he
intended
to
counsel
the
crime,
he
was
guilty
of
felony
murder,
unless
he
could
prove
the
affirmative
defense,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
obviously
he
didn't
prove
the
affirmative
defense,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
jury
actually
found
that
he
used
one
set
of
words
or
another.
it
just
means
that
they
didn't
believe
that
he
had
proven
by
his
burden
of
proof
that
he
had
not
counseled,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
a
possibility--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
not
that
it
was
an
actual
finding
by
the
jury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what
hope
does
he
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
hope
does
he
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
thought
he
was
life
without
parole.
i
thought
he
was
sentenced
to
life
without
parole.
how
can
the
parole
board--
