mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
imposing
life
without
parole
sentences
on
aggravated
murder
offenders
like
evan
miller
is
in
line
with
the
national
consensus,
is
morally
justified,
and
is
consistent
with
legitimate
penological
goals.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
all
three
of
those
points
at
some
juncture
today
if
i
can,
but
i'd
like
to
start
if
i
can
with
the
conversation
mr.
stevenson
was
having
with
a
few
of
the
justices
about
the
national
consensus
issue
in
this
case
and
more
particularly
what
we
can
infer
about
the
judgment
of
legislatures
and
ultimately
the
people
based
on
the
statutes
we
have
in
this
case
and
the
very
different
set
of
circumstances
we're
looking
at
here
then
the
circumstances
the
court
was
looking
at
in
graham.
exhibit
a
on
that
front
is
the
fact
that
out
of
the
39
states
or
jurisdictions
that
allow
this--
sentence,
as
mr.
stevens
has
indicated
--
or
mr.
stevenson
has
indicated,
a
good
chunk
of
them,
27
in
all,
make
the
sentence
the
minimum
sentence
under
the
statute.
that's
an
important
fact
both
because
it
tells
us
a
little
bit
about
the
retributive
goals
that
the
legislatures
were
trying
to
achieve
through
these
statutes,
but
it
also--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--life
without
parole
is
the
minimum
sentence
for
anyone
who
commits
an
aggravated
murder
or
at
least
certain
kinds
of
aggravated
murders
in
27
of
those
jurisdictions.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
for
a
juvenile,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
that's
correct.
and
effectively
the
message
that
the
legislatures
are
sending
is
that
with
respect
to
aggravated
murders,
the
worst
of
the
worst
kinds
of
murders,
there
are
effectively
two
sentences.
there
is
either
the
death
penalty
or
there
is
some
sort
of
mitigating
circumstance.
the
person
is
at
least
going
to
serve
life
without
parole
in
order
to--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--we
don't
have
precise
statistics,
sir.
i
should
say
i--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--i
can't
vouch
to
the
statistics
on
that
point.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
my
answer
is
i
don't
know,
in
terms
of
how
many
are
mandatory
and
how
many
are
not.
mr.
stevenson--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--well,
overall,
mr.
stevenson
cited
about
8
who
were
sentenced
pursuant
to
non-mandatory
schemes
of
the
79
to
82.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
correct.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
according
to
mr.
stevenson's
statistics,
it's
about
90
percent
of
the
cohort
that
comes
from
the
mandatory
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
the
statistics
i
have
seen
that
mr.
stevenson
cited
in
his
reply
brief
had
7500--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--as
the
number
of
arrests
of
persons
under
the
age
of
15
for
committing
homicide
or
non-negligent
manslaughter.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
but
that--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--it--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
as
graham
indicated,
that
denominator
is
crucial.
but
the
7500
number
cannot
be
the
appropriate
denominator
for
determining
whether
actual
sentencing
practices
indicate
a
national
consensus
against
this
practice.
the
reason
why
is
because
that
7500
number
is
not
the
number
of
convictions;
it's
not
the
number
of
opportunities
that
judges
would
have
had
to
impose
this
sentence.
it
is
the
number
of
arrests.
and
it's
the
number
of
arrests
over
the
course
of
40
years
in
every
jurisdiction,
including
those
that
don't
impose
life
without
parole
at
all.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
and
the
real
denominator
here,
the
one
the
court
ought
to
look
at
when
it
considers
the
role
that
actual
sentencing
practices
play
in
the
analysis,
ought
to
be
the
number
of
aggravated
murder
convictions.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
a
number
we
don't
have.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
sotomayor,
the
clearest
line
the
court
could
draw
on
this
front
would
be
the
line
that
the
court
initially
set
out
in
graham
as
between
homicide
and
non-homicide
offenses.
perhaps
there
would
be
some
question
about
whether
an
edmund
type
felony
murder
counts
as
a
homicide
offense
or
not,
but
my
suggestion
is
that
it
would,
at
least
if
the
court
is
looking
for
a
clear
line
that
wouldn't
undermine
too
much
of
what
the
court
set
out
in
graham
in
terms
of
clearly
distinguishing
between
homicide
and
non-homicide
offenders.
nonetheless,
i
certainly
agree
that
there
are
fundamental
differences
between
certain
kinds
of
murders,
and
i
think
that
judgment
is
reflected
in
the
legislation
we
have
in
at
least
27
of
these
states,
where
aggravated
murder
in
the
very
least
carries
with
it
a
life
without
parole
sentence
for
any
defendant
regardless
of
the
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
it
is
a
legislative
determination
that
aggravated
murder
as
a
class
of
offenses
is
so
contrary
to
society's
values,
and
so
contrary
to
the
dignity
that
we
assume
that
every
victim
ought
to
be
afforded,
that
life
without
parole
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
so
i
think
there
is
an
inference
to
be
made
there
about
the
legislative
judgment,
particularly
because
the
sentence
is
a
minimum
one.
the
three
justice
concurrence,
you
mentioned,
justice
sotomayor,
from
harmelin
makes
this
point
--
point
quite
vividly.
in
solem
v.
helm,
the
court
had
struck
down
a
sentence
under
the
gross
disproportionately
analysis,
and
the
harmelin
concurrence
indicated
that
the
court
was
a
little
more
comfortable
doing
that,
because
the
sentence
in
that
case
was
above
the
minimum,
and
thus,
did
not
reflect
the
judgment
of
the
legislature.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
the
minimum
sentence,
it's
fair
to
infer
that
that
is
the
sentence
that
the
legislature
not
as
a
class,
in
terms
of
a
class
of
offenses,
that
would
be
the
minimum
appropriate
sentence
for
that
particular
crime.
now,
justice
breyer--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
certainly
within
the
realm
of
reason
and
possibility
for--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
were
lesser
included
charges
of
at
least
felony
murder
which
has
a
very
different
intent
type
element
to
it.
but
miller,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
charge
on
capital
murder
committed
in
the
course
of
arson
which
is
an
intentional
murder
was
found
guilty
by
the
jury
on
that
charge.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
were
two
felony
murder
charges,
one
as
to
the
robbery
in
the
case
and
one
as
to
the
arson
in
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
i
suppose
that's
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
kennedy,
actually,
i
think
you
are
right
to
the
extent
you
are
suggesting
that
juries
probably
don't
--
aren't
actually
instructed
on
that
point.
in
fact,
it
would
probably
be
reversible
error,
i
suppose--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--for
a
jury
to
be
instructed
on
that
point.
nonetheless,
the
judgment
that
legislatures
have
reached
in
terms
of
setting
life
without
parole
as
a
floor
for,
you
know,
any
murderer
is
one
that
was
--
that
is
reasonable
and
justified
and--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--justice
kagan--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--justice
kagan,
the
answer
on
that
front,
i
think,
is
that
harmelin
effectively
sets
a
bright
line
here
such
a
that
individualized
sentencing
is
only
required
in
a
--
in
a
death
penalty
case.
and
it
does
so--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--well,
the
reason
why
harmelin
drew
that
line,
and
i
guess
more
to
the
point,
the
reason
why
woodson
v.
north
carolina
and
lockett
v.
ohio
held
that
individualized
sentencing
was
required
in
the
death
penalty
context
was
not
because
the
sentence
happened
to
be
the
highest
sentence
that
someone
could
receive,
but
because
the
sentence
was
death.
and
there
were
certain--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
alito.
the
states
were
here
jumping
up
and
down
asking
for
that
precise
result,
and
we
did
not
get
it.
and
the
reason
why,
the
result
the
court
thought
was
appropriate
was
rather
than
allowing
the
defendant
to
argue
for
mitigating
circumstances
and
for
the
state
to
respond
with
aggravating
circumstances
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
answer
was
for
the
juvenile
to
get
a
mitigation
trump
card.
and
in
one
of
these
sentencing
proceedings,
the
juvenile
would
be
able
to
say,
i'm
a
juvenile,
and
that
means
that
i
don't
get
the
highest
sentence
i
otherwise
would
get.
i
win
the
sentencing
phase
as
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
kagan,
the
response
on
that
front,
i
think,
is
that
the
rule
from
woodson
and
lockett
requiring
individualized
sentencing
was
one
that
is
specifically
tailored
to
the
unique
aspects
of
the
death
penalty,
aspects
that
remain
unique,
notwithstanding
graham
and
the
rule
it
imposed
with
respect
to
juveniles.
but
also
woodson
and
lockett
--
although
i
realize
the
premise
of
your
question
is
that
we
should
not
look
at
what
other
states
are
doing,
the
premise
of
woodson
and
lockett
was
that
states
had
widely
rejected
mandatory
death
penalty
sentencing,
and
we
know
from
the
legislative
record
here
that
states
have
done
quite
the
contrary
when
it
comes
to
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentencing--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--yes,
justice
breyer,
i
think
there
is
a
minimum
now.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
it
--
i
would
be
hesitant
to
commit
to
a
minimum
without--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--without
further
factual
development--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--okay.
i
will
say
--
i
would
argue
if
i
were
the
state
up
here
trying
to
defend
a
12-year-old
sentence,
i
would
argue
that
that
was
the
line.
so
a
12
--
well,
no
--
well,
yes.
someone
who's
either--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
was
about
to
give
justice
breyer
the
arguments
that
i
would
make
if
i
were
the
state
in
those
circumstances
about
why
that's
the
line.
reason
number
one
is
national
consensus.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--the
number
of
states
that
allow
it
for
a
12-year-old
are
somewhere
around
--
well,
i
suppose
that
number
is
close
to
10
or
so.
so
that's
one
reason
i
would
draw
the
line
around
12
or
so.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
table--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--at
that
point,
we
are
getting
up
to
much
more
substantial
numbers.
i
guess
when
we
get
up
to
14,
we
are
somewhere
in
the
realm
of
30
or
more.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well,
that
i
think
is
the
appropriate
line
in
terms
of
thinking
about
what
the
minimum
is
here.
the
answer
depends
on
the
jurisdiction.
in
alabama,
14
is
the
minimum.
but
that
number
is,
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
jurisdictions,
a
little
high.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct.
in
alabama,
if
you
are
under
14,
you
can't
be
transferred
out.
now,
many
other
states,
at
age
13,
you
can
be
transferred
in
--
you
can
be
transferred
into
the
adult
system
which
is
why
there
are
few
13-year-olds
serving
this
sentence
but--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--in
alabama,
the
juvenile
justice
system's
jurisdiction
terminates
at
21,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
breyer,
the
reason
why
it's
fair
to
infer
that
legislatures
would
have
concluded
that
a
14-year-old,
for
example,
in
alabama
would
be
subject
to
a
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentence
is
precisely
because
it's
mandatory.
surely
the
legislatures
understood
that
when
they
were
transferring
persons
who
committed
crimes
like
aggravated
murder
that
were
well
within
the
heartland
of
the
crimes
for
which
the
transfer
statutes
were
intended,
those
offenders
would
be
subject
to
the
minimum
sentences
at
least.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
say,
well,
the
legislature
might
have
enacted
a
statute
providing
for
transfer
for
a
14-year-old;
and
for
a
non-homicide
crime,
they
might
have
assumed
that
the
person
would
get
less
than
the
maximum
in
terms
of
life
without
parole.
but
surely
the
legislators
understood
that
those
offenders
would
at
least
get
the
minimum.
and
the
reason
the
line
is
more
safely
drawn
at
13
or
12,
it's
because
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
tables
from
the
department
of
justice
reports
that
both
sides
and
the
amici
have
cited
listing
the
transfer
ages,
by
and
large,
the
number
seems
to
be
cut
off
at
12
or
so.
and
12
would
be
on
the
very
bottom
of
the
range;
and
if
i
were
a
defense
attorney,
i
would
be
arguing
much
harder
for
a
line
at
13
than
12.
i
imagine
if
i
were
a
defense
attorney,
i'd
be
arguing
for
an
even
higher
line
than
that.
but
the
point
is
that
if
we
are
going
to
judge
this
in
terms
of
objective
indicia
of
what
society
has
decided,
that
seems
to
be
the
line
that
society
has
drawn.
that
line--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
we
think
that
deterrence
is
in
the
mix,
but
it's
certainly
not
the
primary
goal
that
these
statutes
serve
when--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--retribution,
justice
kennedy,
would
be
the
primary
goal,
bringing
society's
retributive
force
to
bear
on
those
who
commit
the
worst
sort
of
crimes.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
one
point
on
which
mr.
miller
and
the
state
fundamentally
disagree
here
is
it
what
we
can
conclude
about
a
juvenile's
culpability
when
the
juvenile
has
committed
aggravated
murder.
the
reason
why
graham
came
out
as
it
did,
the
reason
why
life
without
parole
was
not
permissible,
was
because
graham
himself
had
not
committed
murder.
the
court
there
said
that
meant
that
graham's
culpability
was
twice
diminished,
once
because
he
was
a
juvenile
and
once
because
he
had
not
committed
murder.
well,
here
we
have
the
hypothetical
from
graham
where
the
one
level
of
diminishment
is
gone.
and
miller
has
--
miller
is
entitled
to
a
one-level
diminishment
because
of
his
juvenile
status,
but
he
is
not
entitled
to
that
second
level
of
diminishment
which
he
is
what
he
is
seeking
here.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
kennedy,
i
know
of
no
statistics
on
that
particular
front.
i
imagine
that
some
vignettes
could
be
told
about
success
stories
and
some
vignettes
could
be
told
about
stories
that
were
not
success
stories.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
haven't
seen
any
studies
that
would
suggest
that
juveniles
do
better,
particularly
when
they
are
subjected
to
the
sorts
of
crimes
that
i
think
everyone
would
have
--
or
the
sorts
of
offenses,
let
me
say,
that
i
think
everyone
would
agree
the
constitution
would
have
to
permit
a
sentence
of
say
40
years
minimum
or
the
like.
so
i
just
don't
think
--
i
think
society
--
society's
primary
goal
here
or
the
government's
primary
goal
here
is
expressing
the
retributive
judgment
about
the
wrongfulness
of
murder
and
why
it's
different
from,
not
homicide,
but
i
think
governments
are
quite
legitimate
and
quite
reasonable
when
they
also
say
that
they
don't
want
to
roll
the
dice
on
convicted
murderers.
society
acts
with
particular
revulsion
when
a
convicted
murderer
commits
a
crime
again.
and
even
if
--
and
even
if
that
difference
in
terms
of
recidivism
is
no
different,
or
even
if
the
possibility
for
recidivism
is
no
different,
the
fact
that
the
person
committed
a
murder
once
and
might
commit
a
murder
again
is
reason
enough
for
legislatures
to
be
hesitant
to
allow
for
parole
in
these
circumstances.
with
respect
to
the
penological
purposes,
there's
also
an
important
purpose
here
with
respect
to
the
unique
factors
and
the
unique
circumstances
that
murder
victims
and
their
families
face.
i
think
a
lot
of
people
hear
about
life-without-parole
sentences,
and
if
they
impose
them
on
political
grounds
or
policy-based
grounds,
one
of
their
sort
of
pragmatic
responses
is,
well,
what's
the
cost
to
all
this?
why
not
just
let
these
guys
get
their
parole
hearings,
give
them
that
hope,
and
likely
they
won't
get
parole
anyway?
and
there's
really
no
cost
to
society
at
least
in
allowing
that
process
to
occur,
but
the
cost
is
to
the
victims
and
their
families
who
have
to
endure
what
are
often
very
painful
hearings
and
parole
hearings.
and
when
those
come
up
on
a
frequent
basis,
that
sort
of
re-traumatization
process
is
something
that
governments
can
legitimately
take
into
account
when
they
decide
that
for
aggravated
murder
--
not
for
other
crimes
but
for
aggravated
murder
--
that
a
life-without-parole
sentence
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
on
the
moral
culpability
point,
there
would
be
some
anomalies
created
by
the
rule
that
miller
is
seeking
here.
miller's
asking
the
court
to
effectively
hold
him
in
the
same
place
in
terms
of
his
moral
culpability
as
the
defendant
in
graham.
in
other
words,
graham
can
only
get
life
--
life
with
parole
because
of
his
reduced
moral
culpability.
and
miller
is
saying
he
should
only
get
life
without
parole
because
of
his
reduced
culpability.
so
that
would
mean
one
of
two
things:
either
the
eighth
amendment
would
put
a
murderer
on
the
same
moral
level
as
someone
who
committed
a
non-homicide
crime
as
in
graham;
or
graham
himself
would
be
back
in
this
court
or
a
court
of
another
jurisdiction
arguing
that
because
graham
held
that
graham
himself
had
categorically
less
culpability
than
someone
like
miller,
then
graham
himself
is
entitled
to
a
lesser
punishment
than
the
one
that
miller,
in
fact,
received.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
justice
kagan,
i
think
that
miller's
actions
were
dramatically
different
from
graham's
actions;
in
part
because
miller
intended
to
kill
this
victim,
and
killed
the
victim
in
a
rather
gruesome
way.
so
there's
not
an
element
of
luck
here
in
terms
of
the
fact
that,
oh,
well,
graham
was
simply
lucky
that
he
didn't
commit--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--well,
i
defer
to
my
colleague
from
arkansas
in
terms
of
the
distinctions
between
jackson
and
graham,
but
certainly
with
respect
to
miller's
crime,
his
moral
culpability
is
greater,
and
the
law
should
recognize
that.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
it
certainly
would
be
possible
to
have
a
regime
under
which
a
judge
considered
mitigating
circumstances
in
a
case
like
this.
many
jurisdictions
have
reasonably
opted
for
that
route
rather
than
the
one
that
alabama
and
26
other
jurisdictions
have.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
absolutely.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
would
happen.
you
would
have
arguments
about
certain
murders
being
worse
than
others.
and
mr.
miller
would
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
about
other
mitigating
circumstances
relating
to
his
background
and
the
like,
as
he's
argued
in
his
reply
brief
here.
but
at
the
same
time,
it's
reasonable
for
legislatures
to
conclude
that
they're
going
to
draw
a
line
in
the
sand
with
respect
to
aggravated
murder,
such
that
--
as
a
floor
in
terms
of
the
appropriate
punishment,
the
defendant
is
going
to
get
at
the
very
least
life
without
parole,
a
punishment
that's
no
doubt
severe
but
one
that
is
less
severe
than
the
impact
that
the
crime
has
had
on
society.
and
for
those
reasons,
we'd
ask
the
court
to
affirm.
