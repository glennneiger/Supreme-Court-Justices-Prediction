chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-9646,
miller
v.
alabama.
mr.
stevenson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
idea
how
many
juveniles
subject
to
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
do
plead
to
a
lesser
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
reason,
just
--
i
realize
it's
speculation,
but
wouldn't
you
think
prosecutors
would
view
that
as
a
particularly
attractive
offer
to
someone
who's
young
in
the
sense
that
they
may
regard
the
sentence
as
extraordinary
themselves,
that
it
may
be
particularly
attractive
to
someone
who's
young
in
a
way
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
40-year-old,
a
--
an
offer
of
25
years
may
not
be
as
attractive
as
it
is
to
a
15-year-old?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
might
be
also
a
basis
for
--
to
question
the
statistics
you
put
forward
about
how
often--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--this
sentence
is
actually
imposed.
in
other
words,
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
you
suggest
--
the
prosecutors
in
the
state
may
not
be
immune
to
that
evolution,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
those
statistics
aren't
very
helpful
because
we
have
no
idea
in
the
particular
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
perhaps
the
older
offender
was
less
--
less
guilty
than
the
16-,
17-,
15-year-old.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson.
mr.
neiman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
--
it's
a
little
confusing
to
me,
but
when
you
refer
to
"minimum",
i
assume
that
was
because
of
the
statutes
prior
to
graham
had
death
as
one
of
the
other
options,
that
that
is
no
longer
an
option.
so
it's
--
it's
a
little
awkward
to
refer
to
it
as
minimum
when
it's
also
the
maximum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
have
--
when
an
individual
is
prosecuted
for
an
aggravated
murder
that
carries
this
sentence,
is
it
typical
to
also
charge
lesser
included
offenses?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
and
in
general,
what
is
the
distinction
between
exposure
to
the
--
the
maximum
crime
and
a
lesser
included
crime?
in
other
words,
what
is
the
difference
between
aggravated
murder
and
manslaughter?
it
typically
turns
on
the
state
of
mind,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
juries
in
the
case
where
they
have
the
option
for
lesser
included
offenses
might
be
concerned
in
light
of
the
age
of
the
defendant
about
whether
or
not
the
requisite
intent
was
formed?
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
issues
that
we
have
suggested
justify
a
different
treatment
of
juveniles
have
to
do
with
mental
development,
and
those
same
issues
would
be
taken
into
account
by
a
jury
in
considering
which
of
a
list
of
offenses
the
juvenile
should
be
convicted
of.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
neiman.
mr.
stevenson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
they
--
what
if
they
do?
i
mean,
what
if,
after
our
decision
or
even
after
the
argument,
states
go
back
and
say,
look,
the
decision
is
based
on
the
fact
that
they
don't
think
we
know
our
law,
that
we
haven't
thought
about
it,
so
let's
have
a
hearing
about
it,
and
then
we
vote
that
yes,
there
should
be
--
or
no,
there
should
not
be
a
minimum
age.
we
think
at
16,
whatever
age
they
do.
then
does
the
constitutional
rule
change?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
once
we
get
30
states
saying,
look,
we've
thought
about
it
and
this
is
our
answer,
then
whether
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
it
or
not
changes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
one
of
the
things
we
take
into
account
is
societal
consensus,
and
you
say
we
should
ignore
the
30
--
whatever
it
is
--
states
that
allow
this
because
they
didn't
really
think
about
it.
so
i'm
postulating
let's
make
--
let's
see
if
they
have
thought
about
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson,
mr.
neiman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

argument

case

v.
hobbs.

justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
holt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
know
how
old
laurie
troup
was
when
she
was
shot?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stevenson,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stevenson,
mr.
holt.
the
case
is

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

in
case
number
10-9646,
miller
versus
alabama
and
the
related
case,
10-9647,
jackson
versus
hobbs,
justice
kagan
has
the
opinion.
