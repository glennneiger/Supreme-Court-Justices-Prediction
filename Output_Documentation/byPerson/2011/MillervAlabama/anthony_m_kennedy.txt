justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
you're
saying
it
would
be
unprincipled
for
us
to
say
--
or
at
least
unsupported
for
us
to
say
--
that
the
sentence
cannot
be
mandatory,
but
that
in
some
cases,
it
might
still
be
imposed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
take
that
off
the
table,
then
you
leave
us
with
nothing
but
saying
that
the
sentence
is
never
permitted
or
that
it's
always
permitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
difficult
because
the
statistics
show
there
are
2,300
prisoners
now
under
sentence
of
--
with
life
without
parole
for
juvenile
murders
and
they're
--
that
were
committed
under
18.
2,300
nationwide.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it's
very
difficult
to
assess
your
answer
to
justice
alito
that,
oh,
the
legislatures
don't
know
about
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
can
focus
on
the
mandatory
aspects
of
the
case,
i
think
--
i
know
you'd
prefer
a
more
general
rule
--
it
may
be
that
we
have
to
have
your
general
rule.
i'm
not
sure.
if
i'm
the
trial
judge,
and
i
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
i'm
going
to
give
life
without
parole,
and
it's
discretionary,
what
--
what
do
i
look
at?
are
--
can
i
get
social
scientists
to
come
in
and
tell
me
what
the
chances
of
rehabilitation
are?
are
there
--
are
there
statistics?
now,
we
have
some
quite
compelling
stories
of
rehabilitation
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
if
they're
isolated;
i
don't
know
where
they
are
in
the
statistical
universe
of
how
often
rehabilitation
is
--
is
demonstrated
and
is
real.
what
do
i
look
at?
what's
a
judge
supposed
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again,
it
seems
you're
just
forcing
us
into
a
--
a
bipolar
position.
we're
either
going
to
say
that
you
can't
prevail
at
all
or
that
everyone
under
18
is
--
cannot
get
life
without
parole.
i
don't
see
this
middle
course--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
you
seem
to
have
abandoned,
and
you
can't
tell
me
how
a
judge
would
apply
it
if
we
--
if
we
chose
not
to
abandon
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
life
without
parole
is
the
minimum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
also
--
that's
also
the
maximum
because
there
could
be
no
death
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
juries
instructed
that
life
without
parole
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
their
decision?
i
suppose
a
defense
attorney
could
argue
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
think
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
idea
of
deterrence
kind
of
drops
by
the
way
side.
have
there
been
any
studies
that
show
that
there
is
a
deterrence
value?
i
remember
in
roper,
there
was
actually
discussion
among
the
young
people
before
they
committed
the
crime
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
get
the
penalty.
it
was
actually
right
there
in
the
record.
does
the
state
rely
on
the
deterrence
component
of
the
punishment
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
retribution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
retribution,
of
course,
is
related
to
personal
culpability.
we
said
that
in
tison,
and
that
loops
back
into
the
minor
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
any
statistics
that
give
us
some
quantitative
sense
as
to
how
many
juveniles
after
years
and
years
of
prison
show
significant
rehabilitation?
do
we
know
anything
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
judge
were
to
determine
under
a
--
a
rule
that
the
sentence
can't
be
mandatory
whether
or
not
life
should
be
imposed,
what
would
be
the
sorts
of
factors
that
he
would
look
at,
or
do
you
think
that
those
are
just
too
ineffable,
too
imprecise
to
be
considered?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
just
the
standard
sorts
of
mitigating
circumstances
that
we
see
in
capital
cases
and
things?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
are
the
factors
the
judges
and
prosecutors
use
in
making
that
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
if
you
submit
that
as
a
justification
for
your
scheme,
why
couldn't
those
same
factors
be
applied
to
the
judge
--
by
the
sentencing
judge
after
the
conviction?
in
other
words,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
discretion
is
up
front
before
the
conviction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
my
point
is,
if
the
concern
is
that
--
that
we
have
too
indefinite
standards,
too
few
specifics
to
guide
the
judge
in
determining
whether
there
should
be
a
life
sentence,
the
same
criticism
could
apply
to
the
determination
if
they
didn't
put
him
in
the
adult
system
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
assume
discretion
is
guided
by
certain
standards
or
it's
no
discretion
at
all.
so,
there
are
standards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
commutations
of
life
imprisonment
sentences
are
ordered
every
year
in
arkansas?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
life
sentences?
from
life
without
parole?
