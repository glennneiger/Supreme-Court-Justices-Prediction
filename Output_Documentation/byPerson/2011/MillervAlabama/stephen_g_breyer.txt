justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
the
numbers,
the
79
to
82
--
i
guess
there's
some
disagreement
whether
it's
82
or
79.
regardless,
in
your
opinion,
or
maybe
it's
in
the
briefs,
i
just
can't
remember
it,
of
those,
say,
79,
how
many
are
there
for
reasons
of
mandatory
sentence
where
they
would
not
--
no
one
could
consider
the
individualized
nature
of
the
crime
or
the
criminal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
estimate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
right.
what's
your
estimate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
many
come
from
the
states
that
have
this
mandatory
system?
that
shouldn't
be
too
hard
to
find
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
non-mandatory.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
you
think
it's
almost
--
it's
probably
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
--
all
right.
it's
about
70
or
71,
and
i
remember
reading
a
statistic
somewhere
where
they
managed
to
count
up
the
number
of
possibilities,
i.e.,
serious
murders
committed
by
those
under
15
over
50
years
or
some
long
number
of
years,
and
it
was
somewhere
in
the
70,000s,
what
was
it?
or
20,000s?
what
was
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
seventy-five
hundred?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
about
1
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
percent.
if
i
carry
that
number
around
in
my
mind,
that
1
percent
of
those
who
might
have
obtained
this
terrible
penalty,
1
percent
are
actually
given
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
what's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
must
be
easier
to
get
to
this,
i
guess,
so
i'll
--
but
i
want
to
be
sure
you
do
at
some
point.
and
i'm
not
certain
it's
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
argument.
it
may
be
more
of
a
due
process
argument.
but
i
want
to
know
the
justification
--
given
all
those
statistics
that
you've
seen
and
that
was
in
roper
and
so
forth,
procedurally
speaking,
what
is
the
justification
for
not
giving
the
defendant
any
opportunity
to
point
to
mitigating
features
in
his
lack
of
development,
in
his
age,
in
his
upbringing,
et
cetera?
that
to
me
is
a
difficult
question,
but
before
we
get
to
that
topic,
i'd
--
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
that
--
i
have
--
i
understand
your
arguments,
both
sides.
i
think
i've
pretty
much
gotten
the
arguments
on
the
question
of
the
individualized
sentencing.
you
can
make
an
argument
that
it
should
be
individualized,
life
without
parole
up
to
age
18.
say
7
through
17,
and
there
is
an
argument
the
other
way
which
you
are
making,
okay.
what
i
want
to
know
is
your
argument
the
opposite
way
on
this
one.
what's
the
minimum
age,
in
your
opinion,
or
is
there
any
constitutional
minimum
at
all
in
respect
to
which
you
could
give
for
a
murder
a
child
life
without
parole?
i
mean,
you
could
have
an
instance
of
a
10-year-old
or
an
8-year-old.
i
mean,
is
it
totally
up
to
the
states,
or
is
there
a
minimum?
and
if
there
is
a
minimum,
what
is
it
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
do
your
best.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
say
12?
do
you
want
to
say
10?
do
you
want
to
say
9?
because
as
soon
as
whatever
you
say,
i'm
going
to
say,
14>
["]?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
the
difficulty?
all
right.
so
now
put
yourself
in
my
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
he
is
arguing
that
the
legislatures
don't
focus
on
it.
if
you
do
a
public
opinion
poll,
or
just
ask
me,
for
example,
or
ask
anyone,
you
say
the
question
is:
should
--
at
what
age
should
juveniles
be
able
to
be
transferred
out
of
the
juvenile
system
into
the
adult
system?
you
might
get
one
answer.
maybe
14,
maybe
15,
maybe
12.
but
if
you
put
the
question:
at
what
age
should
they
be
receiving
a
mandatory
life
without
parole,
the
answer
might
be
different.
and
his
point
is
they
never
ask
that
question.
they
ask
the
first
question;
not
the
second.
and
that
disturbs
me
enough
to
think
that
i
can't
think
the
answer
to
this
question
i
asked
you
just
relies
on
public
opinion
polls
or
even
just
the
number
of
states.
i
am
not
sure
about
it.
but
that's
why
i
want
to
hear
your
response,
because
it
sounds
like
we
are
arguing
between
whether
it
should
be
13,
12,
or
14,
in
terms
of
an
absolute
cutoff.
so
how
do
i
approach
that?
i'm
asking
you
for
help
on
that
one.
i
know
you
have
a
side
in
this.
but
i
say,
well,
we
are
talking
about
14,
and
we
have
all
this
scientific
literature
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
we
leave
it,
could
--
could
--
what
was
the
instruction
the
jury
was
given?
was
it
you
find
him
guilty
if
he
was
deliberately
indifferent,
if
he
was
recklessly
--
what
are
the
words
they
used?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
was
recklessly
indifferent
to
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reckless
--
reckless
indifference
to
life
suffices
for
the
death
penalty
for
an
adult.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
right,
then
we'd
--
you
would
have
to
argue
on,
if
we
took
this
tack--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
i
don't
know
that
we
would--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that
you
cannot
sentence
a
juvenile
to
life
without
parole
for
murder
unless
he,
e.g.,
specifically
intends
the
death
or
something
equivalent,
but
something
stronger
than
reckless
indifference
to
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
--
think
about
this,
which
is
not
your
favorite
position,
but
it's
a
position
you've
taken.
it's
the
same
question
i
asked
before.
if
i
say,
well,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
line,
3
years
old,
you
will
say
of
course.
10
years
old,
you
will
say
of
course.
but
nobody
--
there
is
no
problem
with
sentencing
10-year-olds
to
life
without
parole.
12
years
old.
well,
hum,
now
maybe
your
opponents
want
to
defend
that.
13
years
old,
14
years
old
and
of
course
i
am
walking
right
into
the
buzz
saw,
well,
leave
it
up
to
the
legislature.
but
suppose
that
there's
something
to
be
said
for
not
leaving
it
up
to
the
legislature,
at
least
for
the
numbers
that
were
in
that
range.
but
how
would
you
defend
the
cutoff
for
no
life
without
parole
at
say
14,
older
than
14,
rather
than
older
than
15,
rather
than
older
than
13.
what
kind
of
argument
is
there
that
isn't
totally
random
for
picking
that
number
as
the
age
below
which
you
cannot
impose
life
without
parole
even
for
the
most
horrendous
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
18,
you
use
for
a
lot
of
purposes,
18
--
you
could
say,
okay,
18.
the
difficulty
with
18
is
you
are
running
into
2300,
not
79.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
difficulty
is
that
in
roper,
it
said,
well,
don't
worry
so
much
about
not
having
the
death
penalty,
the
other
one,
don't
worry
so
much
about
it
because
there's
always
life
without
parole.
and
the
fact
that
18-year-olds
or
17-year-olds
in
many
respects
are
quite
mature
or
at
least
can
be.
and
so
that
makes
18
seem
not
quite
right.
but
there's
a
problem
with
each
of
them,
so
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--any
other
distinction
that
you
have
been
able
to
think
of
growing
out
of
the
literature
or
growing
out
of
the
law
where
the
cutoff
for
some
roughly
comparable
series
of
things
is
between
14
and
15
or
between
14
and
16,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
in
arkansas
if
a
13-year-old
or
a
14-year-old
is
in
a
get-away
car
and
knowingly
accepts
the
money
that
someone
gets
from
a
robbery
and
intends
to
drive
off
with
it,
and
that
other
person
shoots
the
teller
and
kills
him,
then
that
individual
who
is
14
years
old
is
guilty
of
felony
murder,
capital
felony
murder?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
aided?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
that's
right,
do
--
do
you
think
that
such
a
person
is
less
culpable,
knowing
only
that,
than
a
person
who
actually
takes
out
a
gun
and
shoots
the
teller?
morally
speaking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
what
is
the
argument
for
not
being
able
to
tell
that
to
the
jury
or
judge
who
is
going
to
impose
the
sentence?
what
is
the
argument
for
not
allowing
a
judge
or
a
jury,
at
least
to
think
about
that
question,
before
they
have
--
before
imposing
mandatory
life
without
parole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i
mean
my
obvious
point
is
that
--
that
the
arkansas
system,
once
we
have
he
was
the
get-away
driver
or
assisted
the
get-away
driver,
they
must
sentence
him
at
that
age,
or
despite
that
age,
to
life
without
parole.
and
so,
the
other
side
is
saying,
well,
at
the
very
least
--
he
has
three
other
positions
--
but
at
the
very
least,
the
constitution,
maybe
it's
the
due
process
clause,
requires
the
sentencer
to
take
that
into
account,
the
fact
that
he
was
just
the
assistant
get-away
driver
and
may
not
have
thought
about
the
murder
in
reality,
and
may
not
have
expected
it
in
reality.
why
not
have
to
take
that
into
account
in
sentencing?
that's
the
argument.
i
want
to
hear
directly
your
answer
to
that,
which
is
taking
the
fourth
or
possibly
the
least
weakest
of
his
positions
or
the
least
radical.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
the
arguments,
which
are
very
good
ones,
for
the
importance
of
arkansas
emphasizing
the
importance
of
life
and
not
killing
people.
but
a
person
who
is
an
adult
who
is
faced
with
the
death
penalty,
which
is
certainly
a
strong
statement
along
your
lines,
is
permitted
by
the
constitution
nonetheless
to
make
any
mitigating
argument
he
wants.
and
arkansas
has
to
do
that.
they
have
to
let
him
make
any
mitigating
argument
he
wants.
and
so,
the
argument
here
is
basically,
well,
the
same
is
true
when
a
14-year-old,
because
of
the
lack
of
maturity,
faces
life
without
parole.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
hard
issue
in
this
case.
just
as
--
just
as
the
death
penalty
is
unique
for
anyone
and
therefore
requires
mitigating
elements,
isn't
the
life
without
parole
special
enough
for
an
adolescent
that
you
have
to
let
him
at
least
make
any
mitigating
arguments
he
wants?
now,
arkansas
hasn't
really
expressed
a
view
in
its
legislation
on
that
question,
or
maybe
it
has
and
just
rejected
it.
but
i
don't
know.
that's
--
if
you
want
to
say
something
about
that,
i'd
be
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
i
mean,
that's
what
their
brief
is
filled
with
on
the
other
side,
basically.
and
so
is
roper.
