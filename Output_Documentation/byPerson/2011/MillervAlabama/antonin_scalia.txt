justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
50
years?
is
that
--
is
that
too
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
once
--
once
you
depart
from
the
principle
that
we've
enunciated
that
death
is
different,
why
is
life
without
parole
categorically
different
from
60
years
or
70
years
or
--
you
know,
you'd
be
back
here
next
term
with
a
60-year
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
change
my
--
i'll
change
my
question
to
50
years
without
possibility
of
parole.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
have
no
--
no
distinction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
without--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
about
15
years
old?
15,
60
years;
or
14,
70
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what's
the
distinction
between
14
and
15?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
how
are
we
--
how
are
we
to
know
where
to
draw
those
lines?
we
can't
do
it
on
the
basis
of
any
historical
tradition,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
common
law
left
it
up
to
the
jury
to
take
account
of
the
youthfulness
of
the
offender.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
all
entitled
to
jury
trial,
right,
before
their--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
--
how
do
i
come
to
that
decision?
what
do
i
--
just
consult
my
own
preferences
on
this
matter?
something
like
39
states
allow
it.
i
mean,
the
american
people,
you
know,
have
decided
that
that's
the
rule.
they
allow
it.
and
the
federal
government
allows
it.
so,
i'm
supposed
to
impose
my
--
my
judgment
on
--
on
what
seems
to
be
a
consensus
of
the
american
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
going
to
help
me,
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
that
modern
penology
has
abandoned
that
rehabilitation
thing,
and
they
--
they
no
longer
call
prisons
reformatories
or
--
or
whatever,
and
punishment
is
the
--
is
the
criterion
now.
deserved
punishment
for
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
that's
the
criterion,
is
everything
that
you
say
irrelevant?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
i
don't
believe
in
rehabilitation,
as
i
think
sentencing
authorities
nowadays
do
not.
both
at
the
federal
and
the
state
levels,
it's
been
made
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
it
may
not
be
realistic
to
speak
of
mandatory
life
without
parole.
it's
only
mandatory
if
the
youth
is
convicted
of
the
highest
charge
brought,
but
it
remains
within
the
power
of
the
jury,
in
light
of
the
youth,
to
convict
him
of
a
lesser
offense
which
would
not
produce
mandatory
life
imprisonment
without
parole?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
beginning
to
agree
with
you
about
this
case,
because
i
thought
you
were
appealing
to
what
the
american
people
think
about
the
line
or
maybe
to
the
common
law,
now
that
common
law
had
a
rule
of
the
age
of
reason.
i
think
below
12,
you
couldn't
--
at
least
you
couldn't
impose
the
death
penalty.
maybe
you
couldn't
even
convict
for
a
felony.
but
you
just
plucked
some
number
out
of
the
air.
why
can't
i
pluck
one
out
of
the
air
if
you
pluck
one
out
of
the
air?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
reason
to
think
that
juveniles
are
any
better
than
anyone
else
as
far
as
learning
from
prison
is
concerned?
i
mean,
recidivism
is
a
big
problem,
isn't
it?
people
who
have
been
to
prison
go
out
and
commit
the
same
crimes
again,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
juveniles
are
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if,
instead
of
striking
down
the
laws
in
these
states,
why
don't
we
just
require
the
state
legislatures
to
think
about
it,
all
right?
and
--
and
then
see
how
many
think
about
it,
and
--
and
come
up
with,
you
know,
something
that
agrees
with
you
or
doesn't
agree
with
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
more
democratic
somehow?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
changed
your
mind
in
the
interim?
[laughter]
