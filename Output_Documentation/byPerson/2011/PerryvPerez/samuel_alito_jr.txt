justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
timing?
let's
suppose
that
the
district
court
in
washington
moves
expeditiously
and
issues
a
decision
in
mid-february.
are
there
insuperable
problems
with
postponing
the
texas
primary
so
that
the
plan
that
is
to
be
used
can
--
doesn't
have
to
be
formulated
until
after
the
district
court
in
washington
has
ruled?
texas
has
a
very
early
primary.
some
states
have
them
for
congressional
races
in
--
in
the
fall,
and
the
latest
presidential
primary
i
think
is
at
the
end
of
june.
so
why
can't
this
all
be
pushed
back,
and
wouldn't
that
eliminate
a
lot
of
the
problems
that
we
are
grappling
with
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
a
binary
choice,
if
it's
either
the
plan
enacted
by
the
texas
legislature
or
the
plan
that's
already
been
drawn
up
by
the
court,
yes,
that
could
be
presumably
resolved
rather
quickly.
but
what
if
neither
of
those
is
fully
acceptable.
then
is
it
--
is
it
practicable
to
have
the
primary
on
the
date
that's
been
agreed
on?
and
if
not,
then
would
you
just
prefer
to
limit
us
to
those
two
possibilities
or
would
texas
entertain
the
possibility
of
moving
the
primary
back?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
are
neutral
districting
principles?
anybody
who
draws
a
map
faces
at
the
outset
certain
legal
constraints,
constitutional
constraints,
restrictions
that
are
imposed
by
the
voting
rights
act,
maybe
some
state
law
restrictions
to
the
extent
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
once
you
have
gotten
beyond
that
point,
all
you
have
left
is
districting
policy.
they
are
policy
choices
and
there
are
many
factors
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
drawing
a
map:
how
compact
you
want
the
districts
to
be,
to
what
extent
are
you
going
to
respect
zones
of
economic
interest,
to
what
extent
are
you
going
to
try
to
preserve
old
districts,
what
about
incumbents,
what
about
party
registration?
are
you
going
to
try
to
have
balance
or
are
you
going
to
try
to
favor
one
party
or
the
other?
that's
all
--
those
are
all
questions
of
policy.
and
the
question
is
who
makes
those
policy
decisions?
are
they
going
to
be
the
policy
decisions
that
were
made
by
the
legislature,
or
are
they
going
to
be
the
policy
decisions
made
by
the
district
court?
and
to
say
they
are
going
to
apply
neutral
districting
principles
is
a
subterfuge.
there
is
no
such
thing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
too
much,
but
even
if
you
do
that,
even
if
you
start
with
the
old
plan
and
then
you
modify
it
to
the
extent
necessary
to
comply
with
constitution
and
statutes,
there
are
still
--
i'm
sure
our
computer
could
shoot
out
dozens
and
dozens
of
possible
maps,
and
somebody
has
to
choose
among
them.
now
what
criteria
does
a
district
judge,
does
a
district
court
use
in
making
that
choice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
a
legislature
says
--
says
we
have
a
new
policy,
and
that
is
that
once
we've
satisfied
our
constitutional
obligations
and
our
obligations
under
the
voting
rights
act,
the
only
thing
we
are
going
to
do
is
try
to
draw
the
districts
that
are
the
most
compact
possible,
compactness
over
everything
else.
they
draw
up
a
plan
that
embodies
that
policy,
and
it's
challenged
under
section
5.
now
can
the
district
court
just
say
well,
that's
--
the
state's
policy
is
compactness
over
everything
else,
but
we
don't
agree
with
that,
because
we
have
other
neutral
principles
that
advance
the
interest
of
the
collective
public
good,
which
is
the
--
the
term
that
this
--
the
--
the
words
that
this
court
used.
can
they
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
they
can't
do
that
then
you
are
saying
that
they
are
constrained
by
state
policy,
except
to
the
extent
the
constitution
or
the
voting
rights
act
requires
otherwise.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
texas
says
we
don't
care
about
maintaining
voting
precincts;
this
is
--
this
is
a
matter
of
--
of
administrative
burden
and
expense,
and
we
are
willing
to
bear
that,
so
disregard
that.
the
district
court
can
say
well,
we
think,
we
disagree
with
you;
in
order
to
make
it
more
convenient
to
hold
the
election
and
less
expensive
for
texas,
we
are
going
to
respect
voting
districts.
they
can
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
could
they
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
the
district
court
do
that?
that's
my
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
for
presidential
primaries,
isn't
it?
i
don't
want
to
interrupt,
but
isn't
that
the
date
of
the
last
presidential
primary
rather
than
congressional?
