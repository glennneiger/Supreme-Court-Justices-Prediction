mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judicial
maps
drawn
here
are
truly
remarkable.
they
reflect
the
reality
that
the
district
court
below
lost
sight
of
first
principles.
the
court
repeatedly
invoked
the
principle
that
these
were
only
interim
maps
and
not
remedial
maps,
but
that
obscures
the
reality
that
a
court
has
the
authority
to
draw
an
election
map,
surely
one
of
the
most
powerful
judicial
tools
in
the
judicial
arsenal,
only
if
it
is
identifying
specific
statutory
or
constitutional
violations
or
a
substantial
likelihood
thereof.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
obviously
section
5
is
clear
that
the
new
map
drawn
by
the
texas
legislature,
the
new
maps
drawn
by
the
texas
legislature,
cannot
take
effect
of
their
own
force.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
whether
a
judge
when
having
to
impose
a
remedial
map
to
address
what
all
concede
is
a
one-person,
one-vote
problem
with
the
benchmark
maps
can
look
to
the
new
maps
which
also
remedy
that
same
one-person,
one-vote
problem,
for
guidance.
and
this
court
in
its--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
we
are,
in
fairness
we
are
asking
for
it
to
be
used
as
the
starting
point
for
drawing
the
new
map,
but
that's
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
the
obligation
to
go
to
the
preclearance
court
or
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
remains
fully
in
place.
so
the
only
question
is,
what
is
going
to
inform
the
district
court
in
texas's
exercise
of
remedial
authority
to
remedy
the
one-person,
one-vote
problem
with
the
remedial
plans
--
with
the
benchmark
plans,
rather.
now,
this
court
from
the
very
beginning
of
its
reapportionment
cases
has
emphasized
the
need
to
look
for
legislative
guidance
in
order
to
inform
the
judicial
exercise
of
solving
that
reapportionment
problem;
and
the
need
to
look
to
the
new
maps
i
think
is
most
acute,
of
course,
with
the
congressional
maps,
because
the
benchmark
is
--
is
a
fine
map,
but
it's
a
map
for
32
seats.
and
congress
here
--
the
legislature
of
texas
has
spoken
as
to
how
it
would
like
to
divide
the
new
36-seat
allocation
up,
and
it
seems
to
be
quite
odd
that
the
court
would
simply
ignore
that
judgment
when
it
could
look
to
that
as
the
starting
point.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
a
practical
matter
i
suppose
at
that
point
appellees
would
go
to
the
court
in
texas
and
say:
you
need
to
revise
your
interim
maps
once
again.
now,
i
think,
since
the
premise
for
the
court
drawing
its
interim
maps
is
that
time
is
of
the
essence,
it
can't
wait
any
longer,
the
texas
court
may
deny
that
motion
or
it
may
grant
that
motion.
i
mean
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
have
a
crystal
ball
to
take
that
into
account.
but
what
i
do
think
is
particularly
anomalous
is
let's
suppose
that
the
d.c.
court
does
deny
preclearance.
at
that
point
it's
common
ground
that
the
plan,
the
legislatively
enacted
plan,
even
though
it's
denied
preclearance,
would
be
something
that
the
texas
court
would
have
to
defer
to.
that's
basically
upham.
so
it's,
the
oddity
of
the
other
side's
position--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
mean
it's
true
that
the
justice
department
does
raise
a
purpose
objection
to
the
plans
as
a
whole,
but
of
course
even
that
takes
its
force
from
the
way
particular
districts
are
being
drawn.
it
seems
to
me
quite
likely
that,
you
know,
obviously
our
position
is
that
the
d.c.--
court
is
most
likely
to
grant
preclearance;
but
if
they
were
to
deny
it,
it
seems
quite
likely
that
they
would
deny
it
as
to
particular
districts,
and
then
upham
would
make
clear
that
you
would
give,
that
the
texas
court
would
give
deference
to
the
legislative
plan.
and
the
anomaly
of
the
other
side's
position
is
you
give
less
deference
to
a
plan
when
preclearance
is
pending
than
you
do
when
preclearance
is
denied.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
two
--
two
answers:
one
is,
as
a
practical
matter
all
of
the
affected,
you
know,
entities
in
texas
have
gotten
together
and
they
have
agreed
on
the
ability
to
move
the
primary
back
to
april,
given
--
on
the
assumption
that
a
map
could
be
in
place
by
february
1st.
now,
the
primary
has
been
moved
from
march
to
april
already,
so
i
can't
tell
you
that
it's
impossible
to
move
it
again.
but
it's
also
quite,
you
know,
in
a
sense,
i
mean,
the
question
becomes,
i
mean
texas
has
made
its
own
determination
that
it
wants
to
have
a
relatively
early
primary.
that's
not
something
that
popped
up
for
this
set
of
elections.
it's
had
that
in
place
since
at
least
1988.
and
so
the
question
is
how
much
do
you
want
to
interfere
with
that
judgment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
look.
texas
wants
the
court
to
have
the
opportunity
to
get
this
right.
we
think
the
decision
below
is
profoundly
wrong.
we
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
send
a
clear
signal
to
the
courts
that
would
provide
relief
not
just
in
this
case
but
to
future
situations
where
this
arose.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
road
map
for
the
extent
to
which
they
give
a
road
map.
i
think
there
are
two
things
that
are
crystal
clear.
one
is
that
when
the
d.c.
authority,
be
it
the
attorney
general
or
the
court
denies
preclearance,
it
denies
preclearance.
the
plan
is
not
precleared.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
preclearance
in
part
or
partial
preclearance.
as
the
justice
department
puts
it,
it
doesn't
work
like
a
line
item
veto.
now,
that's
not
to
say
--
and
here's
the
second
point.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
court
doesn't
provide
reasoning
for
its
decision
or
the
attorney
general.
and
that's
why
in
upham,
for
example,
that
the
court
--
this
court
knew
that
the
objections
were
to
two
particular
districts,
even
though
the
effect
in
upham
was
to
not
preclear
the
whole
plan.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
mistake
of
the
district
court
is
it
effectively
treats
the
unprecleared
plan
as
a
nullity.
and
that's
the
exact
word
that
judge
johnson
used
in
the
lower
court
opinion
in
upham.
and
this
court
reversed
and
it
said:
no,
you
don't
ignore
that;
but
on
the
other
hand,
what
you
do
is
you
take
into
account
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general
in
that
case,
but
other
than
that,
you
take
the
plan
into
account
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
precleared.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
here's
why
we
are
not
asking
the
regional
court
to
mimic
the
d.c.
court's
function.
we
are
asking
it
to
perform
correctly
the
one
--
one
of
the
roles
that
this
court
has
always
made
clear
the
regional
court
retains.
and
that's
to
provide
temporary
relief.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
decisions
that
essentially
warn
off
a
regional
court
from
arrogating
to
itself
the
final
preclearance
decision
--
i'm
thinking,
for
example,
of
connor
against
waller
--
those
same
decisions
say,
but
this
is
not
with
prejudice
to
your
ability
to
provide
temporary
relief.
now,
our
position
is
quite
simple.
if
we
are
in
a
situation
where
the
regional
court
has
to
provide
temporary
relief,
then
it
should
apply
the
same
standards
that
always
apply
everywhere
to
courts
issuing
temporary
relief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kagan,
i
think
we
are
taking
that
into
account.
i
mean
--
and
i
think
that's
at
the
heart
of
what's
going
on
here.
you
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question:
what
is
the
remedy
that
the
texas
court
in
this
case
was
trying
--
what
is
the
violation,
rather,
that
the
texas
court
was
trying
to
remedy.
the
appellees
proceed
and
i
think
your
question
proceeds
on
the
assumption
as
if
the
violation
is
a
section
5
violation.
but
that's
not
what
motivated
the
court's
opinion,
and
you
can
--
i
mean,
look
at
page
96
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
court
specifically
says:
look,
texas
has
always
been
cleared.
they
need
to
get
preclearance.
so
this
is
not
about
enjoining
them
from
implementing
the
plan.
the
constitutional
violation
that
is
being
remedied
here
and
the
only
thing
that
gave
the
texas
court
any
authority
is
the
one
person,
one
vote
violation
with
the
old
plans.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
on
january
9th,
justice
breyer,
you
should
take
another
look
at
el
paso
county.
because
i
think
if
you
look
at
el
paso
county--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--in
either
the
congressional
map
or
the
house
map.
i
think
if
you
look
at
el
paso
county
what
you
cannot
conclude
is
that
all
--
14--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it
depends.
if
we
are
looking
at
the
congressional
map,
i
believe
it's
district
16
or
17.
and
those
maps
start
on
page
1.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean,
i
think
you
are
understating
it.
i
mean,
on
the
benchmark
plan--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there
is
a
whole
straight
line.
on
the
enacted
plan
it
was
a
different
straight
line.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
want
to
say
two
reasons
why
it's
wrong,
but
first
i
think
that
really
does
answer
your
premise,
which
is
that
all
the
court
was
doing
was
remedying
one
person,
one
vote.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
what
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
it's
my
strongest
case.
i'm
saying
it's
illustrative
of
the
problem.
another
thing
that's
illustrative
of
the
problem--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
problem
is
that
the
court
lost
sight
of
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
doing.
it
was
supposed
to
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
what's
wrong
with
it
is
because
they
neither
started
with
the
old
benchmark
plan
and
said
we
are
going
to
solve
the
one
person,
one
vote
problem,
nor
did
they
start
with
the
new
legislative
plan
and
say
is
there
some
violation
that
allows
us
to
change
that
plan.
they
instead,
as
they
told
you
said
that
they
were
on
their
own
drawing
an
independent
map.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what
i
was
hoping
to
say
is
that
they
--
they
told
you
they
were
drawing
an
independent
map,
and
what
they
told
you
is
that
they
thought
that
they
were
under
an
affirmative
obligation
not
to
defer
to
the
legislative
enactment
because
it
hadn't
been
precleared.
and
the
oddity
of
this
--
i
mean
look,
you're
right.
in
certain
places,
they
then
turn
around
and
say:
but
we
deferred
where
we
could.
but
the
oddity
of
their
position
is
their
first
premise,
which
is
the
one
thing
we
can't
do
in
drawing
these
maps,
is
look
at
that
--
look
at
that
unprecleared
map.
there's
no
explanation
for
why,
if
that
premise
was
right,
why
would
it
be
even
a
good
thing
that
were
pointing
to
the
other
map.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
basic
principle
they
violated
is
they
drew
an
interim
order
that
they
thought
wasn't
a
remedial
order
without
it
being
based
on
any
finding
of
substantial
likelihood
of
a
violation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
may
be
right.
there
may
be
a
problem
with
those
maps
in
el
paso.
i
don't
think
so,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that.
but
if
the
district
court
had
said,
you
know,
there's
a
problem
with
this
because
the
two
antler
--
the
deer
with
two
antlers,
that
violates
--
that's
a
substantial
likelihood
of
violating
the
constitution.
we're
going
to
remedy
that.
if
that's
what
they
did,
this
would
be
a
very
different
case.
now,
i
do
want
to
talk
about
the
deer
with
two
antlers,
because
what
that
ignores
is
that
in
the
benchmark
plan,
the
deer
had
one
antler
and
an
antenna.
and
so
the
district
court
--
the
map
the
district
court
drew
doesn't
look
anything
like
the
benchmark,
and
actually
the
map
that
the
legislature
drew
looks
very
much
like
the
benchmark.
and
so
i
think
that
just
shows
that
what
was
going
on
here
by
the
district
court
was
something
very
different
from
either
remedying
a
one-person,
one-vote
problem
with
the
benchmark
or
from
correcting
specific
identified
problems
with
the
legislative--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
that
is
the
case,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
many
problems
with
the
way
that
the
court
proceeded
here.
because
once
you
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that,
look,
we
only
have
remedial
authority
if
we're
remedying
substantial
likelihood
of
violations
that
are
identifiable
and
particular,
well,
then
what
are
you
going
to
do?
what
this
district
court
did,
after
he
started
where
justice
breyer
suggested,
is
that
the
district
court
judges
then
said:
look,
we
want
to
avoid
the
challenges
that
are
brought
by
the
plaintiffs.
and
what
they
mean
by
"avoid"
is
they
basically
take
all
the
allegations
at
face
value
and
then
redraw--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely
no
problem
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
and
the
great
thing
about
that
is
that
gives
the
district
court
a
familiar
role
to
play
applying
familiar
standards,
and
it
gives
this
court
something
to
review.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
can
i
respond
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
as
follows,
which
is,
i
had
assumed
that
justice
kennedy's
question
was
not
specific
to
section
5
and
could
just
as
well
be
a
section
2
problem--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--or
an
equal
protection
under
the
constitution
problem.
and
in
this
case,
there
is
no
problem.
all
the
court
is
doing
is
making
a
substantial
likelihood
determination
of
an
issue
that
it's
ultimately
going
to
confront.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
kagan.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
that
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
in
this
remedial
phase
should
take
section
5
into
account,
it's
just
in
considering
whether
or
not
the
remedial
plan
is
consistent
with
section
5
principles.
and
that's
what
the
judges
did
in
this
case
with
respect
to
their
own
plan.
so
we're
not
i'm
asking
them
to
do
something
with
section
5
that
they
otherwise
wouldn't
do.
and
again,
i
think
if
you
come
back
to
the
particular
question
of
what
are
they
trying
to
remedy,
they
are
trying
to
remedy
the
one
person,
one
vote
problem.
so
if
that's
what
they're
trying
to
remedy,
why
wouldn't
they
take
into
account
the
legislative
policy
judgments
reflected
in
the
unprecleared
plan
if
that's
--
if
that's
the
state
we're
in,
if
that's
the
snapshot
we're
in.
keep
in
mind,
this
court
has
throughout--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--two
things,
justice
kagan.
one,
i
would
beg
to
differ
that
what
section
5
says
is
that
there's
no
presumption
of
regularity.
and
i
think
that's
--
it's
not
just
a
quibble.
because
i
think
if
what
section
5
says
is
that
there's
no
presumption
of
regularity,
or
no
presumption
of
good
faith,
then
section
5
i
think
is
closer
to
the
constitutional
edge
than
this
court
said
in
northwest
austin.
i
think
all
it
says--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
the
assumption
is
that
the
legislature
didn't
act
in
good
faith
in
enacting
the
provision.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
second
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
i
agree,
but
then
the
question
is,
if
there's
not
a
presumption
of
bad
faith,
then
why
wouldn't
the
court
take
that
legislative
judgment
into
account
in
drawing
its
remedy
for
the
one
person,
one
vote
violation
in
the
remedial
district?
if
i
could
add
my
second
point,
which
is
the
other
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
preclearance
obligation
is
not
driven
by
congressional
judgment
that
these
covered
jurisdictions
are
particularly
bad
at
remedying
one
person,
one
vote
problems.
obviously,
section
5
is
driven
by
concerns
about
racial
discrimination.
so
in
that
sense
it's
particularly
odd,
given
that
what's
at
issue
here
is
a
remedy
for
a
one
person,
one
vote
problem
that
you
would
assume
that
you're
not
going
to
take
into
account
the
legislature's
judgment
as
reflected
in
an
unprecleared
claim.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
you
try
to
split
the
difference
by
trying
to
apply
the
preliminary
injunction
standards.
and
i
think
if
you
do
that,
then
what
you're
going
to
do
is
that
you're
going
to
ensure
that
the
remedy
that
the
district
court
draws
for
--
as
an
interim
matter
for
the
one
person,
one
vote
problem,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
preclearance,
that
remedy
is
both
consistent
with
the
legislative
policy
judgments,
but
also
with
section
2,
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
suppose
if
this
court
wants
to,
it
can
say
that
for
purposes
of
interim
temporary
relief,
the
court
can
look
at
section
5
directly.
i
would
think
the
better
answer
is,
no,
you
just
focus
it
on
section
2,
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
then
you
ensure
that
the
judicial
plan
is
consistent
with
section
5
principles,
because
that's
the
test
that
the
court's
going
to
apply
in
any
event.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
--
i
don't
think
judge
smith
--
if
i
can
answer
your
question,
i
think
this
does:
i
don't
think
judge
smith
did
this
the
way
that
we
think
he
should
or
focused
on
the
benchmark.
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
plan,
what
he
did
is
he
just
basically
picked
one
of
the
proposals,
that
was
a
bipartisan
proposal,
the
so-called
c216.
with
respect
to
the
house
plan,
i
think
he
got
it
--
the
texas
house
plan
--
i
think
he
got
it
closer
to
right.
but
i
don't
think
he
applied
the
right
standard.
and
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
joint
appendix
193,
and
particularly
his
consideration
of
house
district
33.
because
there,
what
judge
smith
did
is
said,
well,
you
know,
there's
these
allegations,
and
i
find
this
--
he
said
the
state
has
persuasive
responses,
but
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
i
am
going
to
redraw
the
districts.
that
doesn't
seem
quite
right.
i
mean,
if
the
state
really
does
have
persuasive
responses,
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
not
redraw
the
districts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
but
it's
certainly
a
fair
improvement
over
what
the
district
court
majority
did.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
as
one
of
justice
alito's
questions
highlighted,
one
of
the
things
that
makes
remedying
a
one
person
one
vote
problem
particularly
unique
is
there's
literally
an
infinite
number
of
ways
to
solve
the
problem.
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
has
always
looked
wherever
it
could
to
legislative
guidance.
so
much
so
that
in
white
v.
weiser,
this
court
looked
for
legislative
guidance
to
a
plan
that
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
for
failing
to
accommodate
one
person
one
vote
problems,
but
yet
this
court
still
said
that
the
district
court
erred
in
not
taking
them
into
account
to
the
extent
that
it
could.
as
to
the
hard
choice,
if
it
comes
to
that,
of
using
either
the
legislative
plan
that
reflects
the
legislative
will,
or
the
judicial
plan
that
even
the
united
states
concedes
is
flawed,
i
think
this
court
has
faced
even
more
difficult
choices
in
the
past:
bullock
v.
weiser
and
in
whitcomb.
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
chose
between
an
adjudicatedly
unconstitutional
state
plan
and
a
judicial
remedy
that
it
determined
was
flawed.
and
in
both
cases,
it
ordered
the
election
to
take
place
under
the
flawed
constitutionally
adjudicated
imperfect
plan.
compared
to
that,
simply
saying
that
an
election
should
go
forward
under
a
plan
that
hasn't
been
precleared
is
a
far
less
serious
step.
now,
there
was
a
reference
made
to
the
3
days
of
hearings.
but
the
problem
is,
3
days
of
hearings
with
an
unadministrable
standard
is
worse
than
1
day
of
hearing
with
an
unadministrable
standard.
and
what
we
ask
is
for
a
preliminary
injunction
standard
that's
familiar
to
everybody,
everybody
understands
and
everybody
can
apply.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i'll
join
everybody
in
saying
that
that's
--
that's
better
than
the
--
than
the
worst
alternative
i
face,
which
is
to
say
it's
better
than
the
district
court's
opinion.
but
here's
why
it
shouldn't.
that
actually
further
intrudes
on
the
d.c.
court.
because
the
question
that
the
remedial
court
should
not
be
asking
is,
geez,
do
i
really
think
--
you
know,
what
are
the
odds
that
the
d.c.
court
is
going
to
preclear?
it
shouldn't
ask
that
question
at
all.
it
should
ask
the
questions
that
are
before
it.
is
there
a
section
2
violation?
is
there
an
equal
protection
violation?
if
there
aren't
those
and
i
use
the
state's
plan,
does
that
create
a
section
5
violation?
that
is
different
from
the
preclearance
question.
and
on
that
section
5
question,
the
burden
is
not
logically
on
the
state.
and
that's
the
same
section
5
question
that
the
court
considered
on
its
own
motion,
because
it
understands
that
even
when
it
takes
a
plan,
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
section
5
principles.
now,
justice
kennedy,
you've
asked
the
question,
what
if
we
take
section
5
out
of
this,
what
happens?
then
it's
an
easy
case.
then
it's
the
preliminary
injunction
standard.
now,
the
objection
to
that,
of
course,
is,
well,
but
how
can
you
take
section
5
out
of
it?
but
there's
not
interference
with
section
5,
because
texas
still
understands
it
needs
to
get
preclearance
--
before
its
changes
can
take
permanent
effect,
it
absolutely
positively
needs
preclearance.
it's
never
wavered
from
that
prohibition.
so
you
go
back--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
was
simply
going
to
say
if
you
go
back,
the
default
problem
here
is
that
there's
an
infinite
number
of
solutions.
it's
particularly
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
congressional
map,
where
there's
not
four
new
seats.
there's
nothing
else
to
defer
to
than
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
reflected
in
this
plan,
notwithstanding
that
it
hasn't
been
precleared.
