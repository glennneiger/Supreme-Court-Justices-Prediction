justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
had
thought,
mr.
clement,
that
--
that
one
of
your
objections
was
that
in
deciding
whether
they're
using
the
benchmark
or
--
or
the
--
the
legislature's
proposed
new
plan,
whichever
one
they're
using,
they
--
in
drawing
up
their
own
plan,
they
assumed
the
validity
of
all
of
the
challenges.
is
--
is
that
not
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
discretion.
it's
political
discretion.
that's
what's
troublesome
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
government
takes
an
absolutist
approach
to
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
use
an
unprecleared
plan
for
any
purpose.
all
the
law
says
is
that
you
cannot
apply
a
precleared
plan.
the
plan
being
applied
here
is
not
the
texas
legislature's
plan;
it's
the
plan
--
a
remedial
plan
adopted
by
federal
judges.
and
to
say
that
they
cannot
use
in
drawing
up
that
plan
the
legislature's
last
political
decisions
seems
to
me
not
required
by
the
mere
prohibition
against
implementing
that
plan
as
the
plan
of
the
legislature.
what
would
you
do
if
--
if
the
district
court
in
washington
and
the
district
court
in
texas,
neither
one
of
them
acts
in
time,
and
it's
too
late?
it's
too
late
to
have
any
--
any
primaries
anymore?
what
would
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
happen?
you
can't
use
the
old
plan.
you
have
an
absolute
rule
against
using
the
new
plan.
what
happens?
you
disenfranchise
every
voter
in
texas--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
there
may
be
some
voters
in
texas,
may
be,
some
who
will
be
prejudiced
by
using
the
current
plan?
i
suggest
in
that
situation
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
use
the
texas
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
situations
in
which
you
can
use
the
very
plan
that
the
texas
legislature
adopted,
even
though
it's
not
been
precleared?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
no
longer
an
absolute
rule.
so
the
question
is
whether
this
is
another
reasonable
exception
to
a
non-absolute
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
exclude
me
from
the
second.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
gone
along
on
that,
as
you
phrased
it.
the
way
you
phrase
it,
you
say
they
cannot
even
make
the
kind
of
preliminary
inquiry
that
your
friend
suggests.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
not
the
current
state
policy.
the
benchmark
plan
is
gone.
it's
old.
the
texas
legislature
now
has
a
different
policy,
and
that,
you
say,
should
be
ignored.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
presumption
of
its
invalidity.
you
can't
presume
it
valid,
but
you
can
presume
it
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
either
way.
you
are
presuming
it
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
drawn
as?
drawn
as
the
coalition?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
--
one
of
--
one
of
the
basic
rules
that
was
followed
in
drawing
up
the
court
plan
was
not
to
divide
any
voting
districts,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
did
the
--
that
certainly
is
not
a
principle
that
the
texas
legislature
agrees
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
court
just
made
it
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
go
back
from
june
26th.
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
june,
may,
april.
it's
the
end
of
march.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
do
you
expect
the
d.c.
court
to
finish?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
--
why
shouldn't
it
be
inverted
the
way
your
friend
suggests?
