mr.
jose
garza
mr.
chief
judge,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
seems
to
be
general
consensus
on
at
least
three
points
that
we've
talked
about
today.
first,
that
the
unprecleared
plan
cannot
take
effect.
the
second,
that
the
district
court
is
foreclosed
from
entering
and
engaging
in
an
analysis
of
the
issues
that
are
pending
before
the
three-judge
court
in
washington,
d.c.,
and
that
at
this
point,
a
court
ordered
plan
must
be
implemented
on
an
interim
basis.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
a
matter
of
semantics,
your
honor,
because
the
question
is,
did
the
court
give
the
state's
plan
deference.
but
it
itself
said
that
it
began,
as
it
should,
as
it
has
been
directed
by
this
court
with
the
historical
or
benchmark
configurations,
and
then
respected
the
state's
plan.
mr.
jose
garza
we
don't
say
that
the
court
can't
look
at
the
texas
plan.
what
we
say
is
that
the
court,
the
court
can't
implement
the
texas
plan,
and
it
certainly
can't
implement
the
texas
plan
if
there
is
any
suspect
of
discrimination.
and
what
it
did
was
exactly
the
right
measure.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
that
the
court
did
the
appropriate
thing
by
looking
at
the
--
at
this
matter.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
that
the
court
should
look
at
--
first
of
all,
should
not
start
with
the
state's
plan.
it
should
look
at
where
there
have
been
objections
made.
and
the
role
of
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
where
the
question
of
whether
there
are
frivolous
claims
have
been
made.
and
there
have
been
no
motions
to
dismiss
any
of
the
claims
in
washington,
d.c.
based
on
frivolity.
mr.
jose
garza
it
should
not
accept
any
of
the
districts
that
have
been
challenged.
but
i
think
the
difference
in
terms
of
even
assuming
a
violation
--
22--
mr.
jose
garza
--it
should
make
a
determination
either
way,
and
it
didn't.
because
in
those
districts,
it
didn't
adopt
the
plans
that
were
put
forward
by
the
plaintiffs
or
the
challengers
in
washington,
d.c.
it
looked
at
the
benchmark
plan
as
a
starting
point.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
then
it
would
be
assuming
that
the
state
is
correct,
that
it
doesn't
violate
section
5.
that
is
--
that
is
an
inquiry
that
is
reserved
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
jose
garza
no.
mr.
jose
garza
no,
because
what
the
court
did,
is
it
didn't
accept
as
a
remedy
what
the
plaintiffs
proposed
there.
it
reverted
to
state
policy
which
is
what
it's
directed
to
by
this
court.
it
direct
--
it
went
back
to
state
policy
and
it
looked
at
the
benchmark
plan,
and
it
started
with
the
benchmark
plan.
even
with
the
congressional
plan,
where
there
are
four
new
districts,
and
there
is
no
comparable
district
in
the
benchmark,
it
looked
to
the
legislatively
enacted
plan
to
determine
where
to
replace
those
districts.
mr.
jose
garza
that
policy
cannot
be
deferred
to.
it
is
incorporated
in
the
court's
plan
by
--
in
the
manner
in
which
it
did
review
the
plans.
that
is--
mr.
jose
garza
--either
way.
and,
in
fact,
what
the
court
did
--
23--
mr.
jose
garza
--it
--
you
are
not
presuming
it
is
invalid.
you're
--
you
are
suggesting
that
--
you
are
reverting
to
the
next
state
policy.
you
are
not
incorporating
it,
but
you're
not
--
you
are
not
making
any
decision.
and
the
way
you
sort
of
walk
that
tightrope
is
you
go
to
what
the
state
policy
was
before
the
enacted
--
plan.
mr.
jose
garza
i
don't
believe
they
can,
and
this
court
didn't.
the
court
in
fact--
mr.
jose
garza
--and
in
this
case,
part
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
section
5,
and
in
those
areas
and
in
those
districts
where
there
have
been
challenges
--
and
by
the
way
the
district
court
has
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
determined
that
those
challenges
are
substantial,
because
they
have
denied
preclearance.
and
in
fact
they've
said
that
texas
has
not
disputed--
mr.
jose
garza
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
jose
garza
they
denied
summary
judgment,
but
they
went
even
further.
they
said
texas
has
not
disputed
many
of
the
intervenors'
specific
allegations
of
discriminatory
intent.
so
it's
--
it's
--
and
under
the
summary
judgment
standard,
they
have
to
find
that
the
challenges
that
are
being
made
are
substantial.
the
district
court
in
texas
was
not
free
to
incorporate
discriminatory
districts
in
its
interim
plan,
and
it
didn't.
but
it
first
went
to
the
state's
plan,
the
benchmark
plan,
to
begin
its
process
on
how
it
was
drawing
those
districts.
and
there
is
a
good
reason
why
texas
is
covered
under
the
voting
rights
act.
as
this
court
indicated
in
--
in
lulac
v.
perry,
there
is
a
terrible
history
of
historical
discrimination
in
texas,
including
discrimination--
mr.
jose
garza
--that's
not.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
statement
that
the
court
made
is
a
correct
statement,
it
did
create
a
coalition
district
in
dallas.
but
that's
not
describing
how
it
reached
that
--
that
district.
however,
it
describes
how
it
reached
that
district
is
in
a
number
of
other
places;
however,
as
discussed
above
the
court
has
not
intentionally
created
any
minority
districts.
mr.
jose
garza
of
course
it
can
be
read
differently
than
your
honor's
interpretation
of
this,
because
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
we
did
not
attempt
to
create
coalition
districts,
we
did
not
attempt
to
draw--
mr.
jose
garza
--what
i'm
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
what
he
is
saying
is
that
this
is
the
result
of
what
they
have
done.
that
sentence
can
also
be
interpreted
as
saying
this
is
the
result
of
what
we
have
done.
we
have
created
a--
mr.
jose
garza
--yes.
yes.
mr.
jose
garza
precisely.
and
there
is
no
independent
evidence
that
this
was
a
racial
gerrymander.
what
do
courts
look
at
for
evidence
of
racial
gerrymanders?
split
voting
precincts
where
you
go
out
in
cars
and
bring
in
minority
voters.
this
district
maintains
voting
precincts
intact.
it
is
entirely
within
one
county.
it
is
a
compact
district.
especially
when
you
compare
it
to
the
district
in
that
part
of
the
state--
mr.
jose
garza
--i
believe
it
is
describing
what
the
results
of
their
map
drawing
is,
and
i
think
that
is
perfectly
legitimate.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
desirable
to
have
a
minority
district
there.
mr.
jose
garza
a
minority
coalition
district.
moreover,
i
think
the
court
is--
mr.
jose
garza
--i
believe
that
the
plan
that
was
drawn
by
the
court
is
fair.
is
it
the
optimum
plan
that
the
plaintiffs
wanted?
it
is
not.
mr.
jose
garza
that's
one
of
the
principles.
mr.
jose
garza
there
is
two
reasons,
your
honor.
one
is--
mr.
jose
garza
--no.
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
court
saw
maintaining
voting
precincts
is
important.
one
is
because
that
is
what
it's
been
directed
by
this
court
in
bush
v.
vera.
in
bush
v.
vera
the
court
said
we
have
an
interim
election
or
a
--
or
an
impending
election
and
it's
important
for
elections
administrators
in
--
in
order
to
be
able
to
--
to
implement
without
--
without
interference
a
legitimate
election
process,
to
have
whole
precincts,
because
whole
precincts
makes
a
big
difference
in
terms
of
how
the
election
is
--
is
administrated.
the
second
reason
is
that
this
court
didn't
adopt
this
plan
without
any
inquiry
into
the
standards
and
proposals
from
the
parties.
it
was
very
deliberate.
it
was
very
cautious,
and
it
was
very
open.
we
had
3
days
of
hearings
on
what
these
plans
should
look
like
and
what
the
standards
ought
to
be,
including
testimony
from
elections
administrators
and
from
the
texas
secretary
of
state.
and
in
every
instance
those
administrators
and
that
representative
from
the
secretary
of
state
said
the
most
important
thing
the
court
should
consider,
if
it's
going
to
order
us
to
start
conducting
elections
under
a
different
plan,
is
maintain
voting
precincts,
because
that
is
the
most
cumbersome
part.
mr.
jose
garza
the
state
didn't
do
that
in
this
instance.
mr.
jose
garza
and--
mr.
jose
garza
--it's
--
yes,
i
think
they
could,
because
there's
still
the
authority
of
this
court
in
bush
v.
vera
that
directs
courts,
in
drawing
interim
plans
for
impending
elections,
to
be
cautious
about
that,
number
1.
and
number
2,
if
in
fact
in
order
to
get
an
appropriate
map
you
must
split
a
number
of
precincts,
which
means
then
that
you
can't
conduct
the
election
on
april
3,
we
still
have
time,
as
--
as
the
government's
attorney
indicated,
the
--
there
are
states
that
conduct
primaries
as
late
as
june
26th.
the
drop-dead
deadline
is
not
april
3rd,
it's
november
6th.
so
if
this
court
disagrees
with
our
position,
and
is
determined
to
send
this
back
to
the
district
court,
then
it
should
consider
this:
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
about
30
days
away
from
rendering
a
complete
decision
in
the
section
5
case.
that
would
place
the
court
in
texas
in
exactly
the
upham
circumstance.
in
that
circumstance
--
and
the
court
is
poised
to
move.
it
can
move
with
all
due
diligence.
it
had
two
weeks
of
trial
in
which
it
heard
testimony
on
the
plaintiffs'
claims.
it
is
ready.
once
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
tells
us
these
are
the
problems
with
the
state's
plan,
the
court
in
texas
is
primed
to
make
its
decision
on
the
plaintiffs'
claims
under
section
2
and
the
constitution.
and
under
that
circumstance--
mr.
jose
garza
--june
26th,
your
honor.
mr.
jose
garza
that's
correct.
so
utah
is
the
last
--
is
the
state
with
the
last
primary
in
which
it
conducts
both
the
state's
primary
and
the
presidential.
there
are
in
states
--
in
fact,
states
that
conduct
primaries
as
late
as
september
that
have
no
presidential
primaries
at
all.
mr.
jose
garza
the
--
the
critical
date
is
45
days
from
the
election
in
order
to
ensure
--
sending
out
a
ballot
to
overseas
voters,
including
the
military.
so
if
--
if
you
go
back
45
days
and
then
you
give
the
jurisdiction
sufficient
time
to
develop
a
ballot,
because
you
need
a
ballot
to
send
to
the
--
to
the
soldiers,
then
that's
about
--
what
they
--
what
the
testimony
was
is
that
takes
about
--
90
days,
i
believe
is
what
they
testified.
so
45
days
plus
90
days,
and
that's
the
drop-dead
deadline.
mr.
jose
garza
if
go
back
from
june
26th--
mr.
jose
garza
--you
could
develop
a
plan
by
the
end
of
march,
and
we
could
conduct
an
election
in
june,
in
late
june.
mr.
jose
garza
i
would
expect
it
to
finish
by
--
within
30
days
of
today,
because
we
have
closing
arguments
on
the
3rd
of
february,
and
if
the
court
will
act
with
the
sort
of
diligence
that
it
did
on
summary
judgment,
which
was
a
complicated
record
and
a
large
record,
6
days
later,
it
made
its
determination.
it
didn't
issue
its
memorandum
opinion,
but
it
gave
us
something
that
we
could
run
with.
mr.
jose
garza
later
this
afternoon.
[laughter]
mr.
jose
garza
yes.
mr.
jose
garza
that
will
be
closing
arguments,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jose
garza
from
the
--
from
the--
mr.
jose
garza
--in
the
district
of
columbia?
mr.
jose
garza
well,
i
believe
that
the
--
that
the
court
has
found
that
the
--
the
plaintiffs
have
made
substantial
claims
with
regard
to
retrogression
and
intentional
discrimination.
and
of
course,
intentional
discrimination--
mr.
jose
garza
--intentional
discrimination
is
a
component
of
section
2,
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
--
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
judge
smith
in
texas
used,
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
the
preliminary
injunction
standard
that's
being
advocated
by
the
state,
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
meet
that
standard
because
generally,
judge
smith
determined
that
the
plaintiffs
had
presented
colorable
claims
of
statutory
or
constitutional
infirmity.
ruled
that
the
plan
was
an
extreme
gerrymander.
ruled
that
elimination
of
district
149
presented
section
5
problems.
ruled
that
the
legislature
dismantle
the
minority
district
in
essex
county
that
presented--
mr.
jose
garza
--yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
are
section
5
claims
with
regard
to
harris
county.
judge
smith
addressed
the
constitutional--
mr.
jose
garza
--right.
and
in
--
in
district
--
in
harris
county,
the
court
did
equalize
population
per
the
failure
of
the
state
to
justify
the
sorts
of
deviations
that
are
contained
in
that
district,
but
didn't
provide,
in
our
opinion,
additional
remedies.
but
judge
smith's
proposed
plan
for
the
state
house
is
in
fact
very
similar
to
the
plan
that
was
proposed
by
the
majority.
it
--
it
differs
by
only
one
minority
district.
that
is
one
additional
minority
district
is
contained
in
the
interim
plan
than
is
contained
in
judge
smith's
plan.
mr.
jose
garza
well,
i
--
i
think
that
our
position
is
that
section
5
is
clear
that
this
court
should
not
start
with
the
interim
plan,
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me,
i
think
that
that's
a
much
more
reasonable
approach
than
the
one
offered
by
the
state,
for
the
same
reason
argued
by
the
united
states:
that
is,
that
in
the
state's
argument,
you
really
turn
section
5
on
its
head,
because
one
of
the
principal
benefits
for
the
minority
community
in
having
section
5
is
it
alters
of
the
burden
of
proof.
and
if
you
maintain
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
state
before
it
can
implement
any
portion
of
its
newly
adopted
but
unprecleared
plan,
that's
far
more
preferable
than
shifting
the
burden,
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
section
5
in
its
intent.
i
don't
think
i
have
anything
else.
thank
you.
