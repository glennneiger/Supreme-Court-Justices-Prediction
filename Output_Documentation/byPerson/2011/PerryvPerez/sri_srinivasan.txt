mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
flaw
with
texas's
approach
is
that
it
directly
inverts
the
burden
established
by
the
voting
rights
act.
section
5
places
the
burden
on
a
covered
jurisdiction
to
show
that
a
proposed
voting
change
is
nondiscriminatory
in
purpose
and
effect,
and
the
change
can't
go
into
effect
unless
and
until
the
state
carries
its
burden
in
that
regard.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
with
what
judge
smith
did,
i
guess
in
that
context,
justice
kennedy,
there
wouldn't
be
a
section
5
issue
at
all.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
all
you
would
be
dealing
with
is
section
2
or
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
this,
that
in
the
malapportionment
context
what
this
court
typically
has
said
the
district
court
should
do
is
to
start
with
a
plan
that
is
already
in
effect
and
then
modify
it
according
to
neutral
districting
principles
to
remove
the
malapportionment
issue.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
guess
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
alito.
i
want
to
make
two
preliminary
observations
on
what
a
district
court
is
supposed
to
do
in
this
regard,
and
then
i'll
try
to
walk
through
the
principles
that
should
guide
this
inquiry.
the
first
preliminary
observation
is
what
a
district
court
is
not
supposed
to
do,
and
what
a
district
court
is
not
supposed
to
do
is
to
take
the
unprecleared
plan
as
a
given,
because
section
5
forecloses
it.
now,
what's
a
district
court
supposed
to
do?
it's
not
at
sea,
contrary
to
the
underpinning
of
some
of
the
arguments
made
today,
because
the
district
court
starts
with
the
last
legally
enforceable
plan,
which
after
all
is
the
last
manifestation
of
state
policies
and
priorities.
so
you
have
that
as
a
starting
point.
and
then
it
has
to
modify
that
plan,
of
course,
to
deal
with
malapportionment
issues
and
to
comply
with
section
2
and
section
5--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
is
discretion
in
the
inquiry,
justice
alito.
i
am
not
going
to
--
i'm
not
going
to
disagree
with
that.
what
it
looks
to
is
the
districting
criteria
that
had
been
applied
by
this
jurisdiction
in
the
past.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
i
don't
think
you
should
do
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
--
not
in
the
context
of
section
5,
your
honor.
that's
one
option,
but
the
other
option
would
be
to
use
a
malapportioned
plan,
which
this
court
has
suggested
would
be
something
the
courts
could
do.
now,
that
is
not
a
preferred
option,
to
be
sure.
but
we
are
not
in
that
situation
here,
because
what
you
have
is
interim
maps
that
have
been
developed.
we
are
not
in
the
kind
of
emergency
situation
that
you
are
positing.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
only
if
there
is
no
time
for
the
district
court
to
adopt
a
different
plan.
but
if--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
is
an
emergency
exception,
as
there
is
with
all
sorts
of
legal
rules.
but
that's
so
far
as
we
would
go.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
proposition
that
suggestions
what
the
court
would
be
doing
here
under
texas's
view
is
just
a
standard
application
of
substantial
likelihood
of
success
principles,
because
it's
not.
it's
decidedly
different
from
standard
operation
of
substantial
likelihood
of
success
principles
in
three
fundamental
respects.
the
first
goes
to
the
burden,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
you
alluded
to
this
in
your
question.
the
burden
in
a
preliminary
injunction
context
stays
with
the
same
party
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage
as
at
the
merits
stage.
and
so
when
in
a
preliminary
injunction
context
the
court
is
asking,
has
there
been
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits,
the
same
party
has
to
make
that
showing
as
has
to
make
that
showing
at
the
merits
stage.
here
texas
would
turn
that
upside
down,
because
at
the
merits
stage,
which
is
the
preclearance
proceeding--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that
would
certainly
be
better.
i
think
that
would
improve
things
quite
a
bit.
but
that's
not
what
texas
--
the
approach
that
texas
proposes
today.
but
it's
different
in
two
other
respects
from
a
standard
preliminary
injunction
context
as
well.
and
one
is
what
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to,
which
is
here
you
don't
have
a
situation
in
which
the
same
court
that's
going
to
forecast
its
ultimate
adjudication
of
the
merits
is
also
deciding
what
it's
going
to
do
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
know
about
that,
because
i
think
what
a
district
court
is
supposed
to
do
when
preclearance
is
pending
is
not
accept
all
the
challenges.
what
it
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
apply
traditional
districting
criteria
to
the
benchmark.
so
i
guess--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there
is
some
language
in
the
opinions
to
that
effect,
justice
kennedy.
i
have
to
say
the
district
court
opinions
here
are
not
a
model
of
clarity.
in
some
respects,
they
seem
to
outline
the
right
inquiry.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
137
to
138,
i
think
what
the
district
court
said
it
was
doing
was
starting
with
the
status
quo,
which
is
the
benchmark,
and
then
modifying
it.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
we
point
to
that
in
our
brief
as
an
area
in
which
the
district
court
could
give
further
explanation
on
remand.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
section
5
can't
help
but
drive--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--of
course,
your
honor,
texas
is
in
a
different
position
precisely
because
it's
a
covered
jurisdiction.
and
when
you
have
a
section
5
case,
section
5
can't
help
but
take
precedence
in
some
respects,
precisely
because
a
proposed
change
can't
go
into
effect
unless
and
until
the
covered
jurisdiction
shows
that
it's
nondiscriminatory
in
purpose
and
effect.
but
i
do
think
it's
important--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that
--
that
may
be,
your
honor.
but
i
think
then
if,
if
it
can't
address
the
section
5
issue
at
all,
then
the
one
thing
that
shouldn't
happen
is
that
the
section
2
court
gives
effect
to
the
unprecleared
plan,
because
that
is
something
that
the
d.c.
district
court
is
supposed
to
do.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
appreciate
that.
i
guess
what
i
would
say,
justice
kennedy,
is,
if
you
use
the
unpreclear
plan
as
the
starting
point,
which
is
what
texas
proposes,
you
are
giving
effect
to
that,
notwithstanding
the
preclearance
requirement
of
section
5.
and
with
the
covered
jurisdiction,
that
is
something
that
section
5
doesn't
allow.
now,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
consider
texas's
preclearance
submission
in
the
context
of
the
other
statewide
preclearance
submissions
that
have
been
submitted
in
this
election
cycle.
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief
at
pages
la
to
3a,
i
think
what
that
bears
out
is
that
there
is
not
a
fundamental
problem
with
section
5
or
the
way
section
5
operates.
the
problem
insofar
as
it
exists
is
with
respect
to
the
particular
submissions
that
texas
has
made,
because
there
were
20
submissions
of
statewide
plans
for
administrative
preclearance.
in
all
20
cases,
the
attorney
general
precleared
them.
in
19
of
the
20
cases,
the
attorney
general
precleared
it
within
the
initial
60-day
window.
now--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
have
two
responses
in
that
respect.
first,
and
this
goes
to
a
question
that
justice
alito
asked
earlier,
what
is
this
court
supposed
to
do
in
this
situation?
and
i
think
one
thing
that
could
absolutely
happen
is
if
there
were
a
remand
the
d.c.
district
court
could
complete
its
preclearance
proceeding,
which
would
be
illuminating
the
what
the
texas
district
court
is
supposed
to
do.
and
to
have
guidance
on
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--what
i
would
say
is
this.
the
d.c.
district
court
has
scheduled
trial
to
begin
on
january
17th.
it's
supposed
to
last
8
days.
closing
argument
is
on
february
3.
if
you
look
at
what
happened
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
justice
breyer,
they
had
summary
judgment
arguments
on
one
day--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
not
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
of
course,
if
preclearance
is
granted
we
won't
have
an
issue
with
drawing
maps.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
sure.
i
think
insofar
as
the
coalition
districts
and
ability
districts
emerge
from
growth,
there
is
nothing
suspect
about
them.
the
one
example
i
point
to
is
district
33.
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix,
pages
146
and
147,
it's
not
clear
what
the,
what
the
district
court
was
doing
in
that
regard.
