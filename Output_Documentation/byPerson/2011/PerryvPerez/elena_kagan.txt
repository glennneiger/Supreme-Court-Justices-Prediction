justice
elena
kagan
but
we've
said
over
and
over,
mr.
clement,
that
it's
the
attorney
general
and
the
district
court
in
d.c.
that
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
set
of
questions
and
that
we
don't
want
courts
in
other
parts
of
the
country
to
try
to
mimic
what
those
--
what
that
court
and
the
attorney
general
are
supposed
to
do.
and
you
are
essentially
asking
for
the
district
court
in
the
state
of
texas
to
try
to
predict
what
they
are
going
to
do
and
to
mimic
what
they
are
going
to
do.
and
that's
why
justice
alito
suggests,
well,
look,
if
we
said
that
only
the
district
court
in
d.c.
and
the
attorney
general
should
do
this,
let's
wait
until
they
do
it
and
go
from
there.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
are
not
taking
into
account
the
fact
that,
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
section
5
itself
operates
as
an
injunction.
and
it's
an
injunction
against
the
use
of
an
unprecleared
plan.
justice
elena
kagan
but
haven't
we
also
said
that,
with
respect
to
section
2
and
constitutional
violations,
that
those
allegations
would
be
unripe
in
the
--
prior
to
the
district
court
or
the
attorney
general
clearing
a
plan?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
just
because
section
5
says
that
there's
no
presumption
of
regularity
attached
to
that
plan,
and
indeed,
that
it's
unlawful
to
put
that
plan
into
effect
without
the
proper
approvals.
justice
elena
kagan
section
5
says
somebody
has
to
clear
it
before
it
can
go
into
effect.
justice
elena
kagan
nobody
said
the
opposite.
the
question
just
is,
does
somebody
have
to
clear
it?
here,
it
wasn't
clear.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
don't
think--
justice
elena
kagan
well,
would
it
be
okay
if
we
just
said,
well,
texas
has
to
make
the
showing?
justice
elena
kagan
so
do
you
contest
the
view
that
this
district
court
did
essentially
accept
the
challenges,
did
sort
of
say,
well,
look,
there
are
these
challenges,
so
we
have
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
do
anything
that
cuts
against
them?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
know
what
i
don't
understand
about
your
briefs,
mr.
garza.
if
the
states
can't
--
if,
if
--
if
the
plan
has
not
been
precleared,
you
should
be
saying
that
the
states
can't
look
at
the
plan.
but
on
the
one
hand
you
are
saying,
well
isn't
it
great
because
the
court
did
look
at
the
plan,
and
on
the
one
hand
--
the
other
hand
you
are
saying
the
court
can't
look
at
the
plan.
so
which
is
it?
because
there
is
a
real
tension.
on
one
page
you
say
isn't
it
great,
the
court
looked
at
the
texas
plan.
and
then
you
say
the
court
can't
look
at
the
texas
plan.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garza,
what
would
you
think
of
a
system
in
which
the
court
could
start
with
the
texas
plan
and
say
--
the
new
texas
plan
--
and
say
anything
that
is
consistent
with
statutes
and
the
constitution
can
go
forward,
but
it's
texas
that
has
to
show
that
consistency.
so
flipping
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
way
that
mr.
srinivasan
was
suggesting?
in
a
way
that
makes
it
more
consistent
with
section
5's
burden.
