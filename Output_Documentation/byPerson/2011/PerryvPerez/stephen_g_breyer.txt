justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
they
said
they
are
doing.
i
mean,
i
count
eight
times
in
the
house
plan,
the
state
house
plan,
and
several
times
in
the
senate
plan
where
it's
clear
and
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
in
the
u.s.
house
plan,
they
say
things
like:
"the
court
began
by
considering
the
uncontested
districts
from
the
enacted
plan
that
embraced
neutral
districting
principles,
although
it
wasn't
required
to
give
any
deference.
"
and
you
say
they
are
wrong
about
that.
"the
court
attempted
to
embrace
as
many
of
the
uncontested
districts
as
possible.
"
so
after
i
got
finished
reading
their
opinions
i
thought,
well,
there
may
be
a
difference
between
what
you
say
and
they
say,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
difference
that
is
reflected
in
the
maps.
and
so
it's
now
january
9th.
we
have
to
have
something
in
effect
by
february
1st.
they
said
that
they
are
paying
attention
to
what
the
legislature
did
and
when
i
looked
at
the
maps,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
they
include
some
more,
some
less,
most
in
the
state
senate,
but
they
include
a
lot
of
the
state's
changes.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
i
can't
tell
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
without
looking
district
by
district
by
district
by
district.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
on
january
9th?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
which
--
in
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
el
paso
county
in
the
original
plan
i
guess
was
all
like
number
16.
i've
got
it
in
front
of
me.
and
they
split
it,
and
it
was
split
somewhat
differently
or
not.
okay.
then
what
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
right
now,
why
is
that
wrong?
why
is
that
wrong?
tell
me
why
it's
wrong
for
them
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
in
their
way
of
thinking
they
are
taking
the
map
into
account.
now,
to
sit
--
the
enacted
one.
if
i
disagree
with
that,
i
can't
disagree
at
the
level
of
principle,
i
have
to
disagree
at
the
level
of
particular
districts.
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
so
you
point
to
district
16
and
i
say,
very
well,
tell
me
what
they
did
wrong,
and
why?
because,
remember,
they
are
facing
a
challenge
that's
based
on
section
5,
part
purpose.
and
the
district
court
there
said
in
the
d.c.:
you
don't
survive
--
i
can't
give
you
a
summary
judgment
on
that;
purpose
here
may
have
been
violated.
all
right,
now
you
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
district
16,
which
i
guess
is
your
strongest
case?
that
would
be
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
said
they
were
doing.
they
couldn't
have
lost
sight
at
the
level
of
generality,
because
at
the
level
of
generality
they
said:
we
are
trying
to
take
into
account
the
map.
i'm
just
repeating
myself.
i
want
to
know
what
is
wrong
with
the
drawing
of
district
16,
what
they
did,
given
that
there
is
a
section
5
challenge
based
on
purpose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
have
--
what
is
that
based
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
read,
i
read,
i
read
the
opinion
and
what
you
said
on
the
phone
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
complicated
case.
let's
suppose
you
are
completely
right
on
your
time
schedule.
then
they
will
decide
something.
how
could
any
human
being
redraw
maps
in
5
days
or
10
days
where
you
will
have
different
--
6
different
positions.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
impossible.
how
can
you
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
there's
--
it
seemed
to
me
from
reading
it,
i
didn't
think
that
the
judge
there
is
ready
to
grant
preclearance.
and
the
other
thing
in
sending
it
back,
i
read
the
brief
and
then
i
read
the
opinions.
i
don't
think
i
have
--
i'm
not
being
too
generous
to
the
opinions,
but
i
thought
that
they
were
saying
throughout
is:
we
didn't
try
to
draw
extra
coalition
or
extra
opportunity
districts;
they
emerged.
they
say
"emerged"
about
seven
times.
they
emerged
as
we
tried
to
apply
equal
vote
principles.
and
it's
hardly
surprising
that
it
would,
considering
that
the
population
growth
is
primarily
due
to
the
minority
expansion.
so
it
didn't
seem
to
me
--
now
why
do
you
want
us
to
send
it
back
to
get
more
explanation
when
that
seems
to
be
the
explanation,
and
to
me
at
first
blush,
it
seems
like
a
perfectly
good
explanation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--two
sentences
forward,
if
i
could
help
with
the
reading,
the
fourth
new
district,
district
33
was
drawn
in
the
dallas-fort
worth
metroplex
"to
reflect
population
growth
in
that
area.
"
all
right?
then
he
goes
on
to
say
just
what
justice
scalia
says.
and
i
--
i
did
read
that
as
saying,
well,
when
you
apply
--
i
read
it
consistent
what
they
have
said
in
--
elsewhere,
which
is
that
what
they
are
doing
is,
population
grows,
you
have
to
have
one
person,
one
vote;
the
legislature
itself
in
the
new
plan
did
create
a
minority,
whatever
you
--
the
opportunity
district
here,
so
we
are
following
what
they
did.
we
are
taking
into
account
population,
and
it
turns
out
to
be,
and
we
do
create
it
as
--
in
which
case
there
is
some
ambiguity
here.
