justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
ignore
it.
it
took
it
into
account
along
with
other
plans.
my
--
mr.
clement,
suppose
the
d.c.
court
that
has
exclusive
authority
over
preclearance
in
mid-february
denies
preclearance.
and
suppose
--
suppose
we
accept
your
position.
you
prevail
in
--
in
this
proceeding.
and
then
the
three-judge
district
court
says
this
--
this
plan
--
these
plans
do
not
meet
the
section
5
requirement,
we
deny
preclearance.
what
happens
if
we
use
the
texas
plan
that
has
not
been
precleared
as
the
interim
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
see
how
it's
basically
upham.
that
was
a
plan
--
there
were
two
contiguous
districts,
there
was
a
problem
with
them,
the
attorney
general
said
the
rest
of
it
was
okay.
here
the
entire
plan,
the
plans
are
--
are
opposed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
court
in
that
--
in
that
scenario
is
projecting
what
the
d.c.
court
that
has
exclusive
authority
is
going
to
do.
and
that's
why
i
find
your
--
your
position
troublesome.
you're
asking
one
court
to
make
its
best
guess
at
what
another
court
is
likely
to
do,
and
that
other
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
denied
summary
judgment.
they
didn't
deny
preclearance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
denied
summary
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
did
write
in
a
--
in
their
summary
judgment
opinion,
they
made
it
sound
like
it's
very
complicated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
that's
why
i'm
--
i
have
some
doubts
about
how
swiftly
they're
going
to
render
their
decision
after
--
what
is
the
date,
the
trial
will
end
on
february
3rd?
