just
one
more
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
background
question
about
preclearance.
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
three
judge
district
court
in
columbia
in
the
preclearance
proceeding
finds
some
problems
with
two
or
three
of
the
districts,
say,
in
the
congressional
plan.
does
it
just
say,
"there
are
problems
with
these
districts,
we
therefore
deny
preclearance.
"
or
does
it
then
give
guidance
and
say,
"we
would
give
preclearance
if
you
made
the
following
changes?
"
in
other
words,
does
it
give
you
a
road
map?
how
do
these
decisions
work?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
don't
have
any
problem,
if
i'm
a
district
judge
and
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
a
particular
challenge
would
succeed,
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
my
drawing
an
interim
plan
to
avoid
that
likelihood.
justice
anthony

section
2.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
--
can
you
tell
me
with
reference
to
the
two
districts,
other
than
the
senate
district,
congressional
and
state
house
districts,
did
judge
smith
defer
or
use
these
--
the
texas
legislature's
2011
plan
as
a
benchmark
to
some
extent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
fault
his
solution
for
giving
insufficient
deference
to
the
state
of
texas
2011
plan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
this
--
all
the
facts
are
the
same
except
that
this
is
in
a
state
that
is
not
subject
to
section
5.
would
there
be
a
problem
in
your
view
with
what
the
district,
with
what
the
district
court
did,
with
judge
smith
--
with
what
judge
smith
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
alderson
reporting
company--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
we
could
use
--
then
there
would
be
no
problem
with
using
texas
as
a
benchmark,
the
texas
2011
as
benchmark,
as
a
starting
point,
as
a
starting
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
odd
that
this
is
a
section
2
suit
and
yet
section
5
seems
to
be
driving
that
--
driving
it.
that's
the
problem
with
this
litigation,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
section
5
applies
only
to
some
states
and
not
others.
texas
is
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
here
in
defending
the
section
2
suit
and
in
drawing
--
and
in
having
--
and
the
judiciary
is
at
a
disadvantage
in
framing
a
remedy
for
a
likely,
a
likely
section
2
violation
in
some
of
the
districts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wonder
if
it
should
take
precedence
in
a
section
2
suit.
all
this
--
this
is
the
primary
obligation
of
the
texas
district
court,
is
to
address
section
2
violations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
giving
effect
to
an
uncleared
plan.
it's
giving
effect
to
a
legislative
judgment
as
to
what
is
workable
for
all
the
factors
and
criteria
that
justice
alito
referred
to,
county
lines,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
could
it
look
at
the
district
and
say,
well,
it
respects
county
lines;
it
follows
a
river;
it's
got
urban/rural.
can
it
look
at
it
for
that
reason
and
rely
on
the
legislative
judgment
as
making
a
sound
judgment
that
the
river
runs
through
here,
and
the
county
line
is
there
and
so
forth?
that's
what
seems
to
me
the
difficulty
with
saying
oh,
you
can't
look
at
the
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
infer
from
either
the
ambiguity
or
the
other
reading
of
the
sentence
that
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
in
the
court's
view
it
was
desirable
to
have
a
minority
coalition
district?
i
draw
that
inference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
minority
coalition
district?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
you
would
defend
the
plan
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
a
sound
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
the
opinion
from
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
indicates
that
there
are
some
likely
potential
violations
that
are
section
2
violations
as
well
as
section
5
violations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
i
can
amend
that
to
--
and
in
the
submission
of
the
parties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
--
the
second
being
section
2
violations
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
substantive
objections
to
the
plans
suggested
by
judge
smith
in
the
house
and
congressional
districts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
some
section
2
objections?
well,
that
doesn't
quite
work.
you
have
to
talk
about
retrogression,
i
suppose.
