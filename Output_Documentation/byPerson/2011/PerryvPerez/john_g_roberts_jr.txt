chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
11-713,
perry
v.
perez
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish,
finish
your
answer,
please,
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
there's
--
i
see
two
different
problems
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
they
come
out.
one,
you
cannot
assume
that
the
legislature's
plan
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
precleared.
the
district
court
in
texas
cannot
assume
or
presume
what
the
district
court
here
in
d.c.
is
going
to
do.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
can't
presume
it
the
other
way.
in
other
words,
it
can't
draw
its
interim
plan
assuming
that
there
are
going
to
be
these
section
5
violations,
because
that's
presuming
what
the
court's
going
to
do
the
other
way.
so
how
do
we
decide
between
those
two
--
you
have
two
wrong
choices.
how
do
we
end
up?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
right,
but
you
see
it
only
on
one
side
of
the
problem.
you
say,
well,
you
can't
treat
it
as
if
it's
being
pre-cleared
because
that
would
be
prejudging
what
the
court
is
doing
in
d.c.
but
you
have
no
trouble
with
them
saying,
assuming
that
there
are
going
to
be
these
section
5
violations,
in
drawing
additional
majority-minority
districts,
which
is
just
assuming
in
the
other
way
what
the
court
here
in
d.c.
is
going
to
do.
i
don't
know
how
you
lean
one
way
and
say,
it's
horrible,
you
can't
use
it
because
it
hasn't
been
precleared,
but
it's
all
right
in
drawing
the
interim
plan
to
treat
it
as
if
preclearance
has
been
denied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
you
look
--
and
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
146
to
147,
it
looks
the
exact
opposite.
it
looks
like
they're
drawing
minority
coalition
opportunity
districts
to
draw
them,
because
they
have
anticipated
how
they
think
the
district
court
in
d.c.
is
going
to
come
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
let
you
go
on
for
a
little
longer.
we
may
have
a
few
more
questions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
have
--
your
position
--
i
understand
you're
straddling
a
position.
that's
why
you
are
sitting
in
the
back
rather
than
the
front
row
between
the
two
parties.
but
it's
a
little
unsatisfying
because
what
you
say
we
should
do
when
we
are
all
under
the
gun
of
very
strict
time
limitations
is
we
should
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
so
it
can
give
a
greater
explanation
of
what
it's
done.
isn't
that
going
to
be
very
wasteful?
and
it's
kind
of
an
odd
order
from
this
court
to
send
to
a
district
court
saying,
you
know,
tell
us
more.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
--
brief
answer,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garza?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
i
didn't
follow
that.
so
long
as
a
district
has
been
challenged
in
dc,
the
court
in
texas
should
not
accept
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
right,
but
it
goes
the
other
way
when
you
say
they
can't
approve
something
that's
been
challenged.
aren't
you
assuming
that
the
plaintiffs
are
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
an
inquiry
that
belongs
to
the
district
court
in
d.c.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
constitutionality
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
not
at
issue
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
maybe
you
could
turn
to
the
issue
that
i
see
on
joint
appendix
146
and
147.
they
don't
say
a
minority
coalition
opportunity
district
just
happened
to
emerge.
it
said
that
district
33
was
drawn
as
a
minority
coalition
opportunity
district.
and
we
have
never
held
that
it
is
appropriate
or
even
permissible
to
draw
a
district
where
you
are
putting
in
together
two
minorities,
two
different
minority
groups.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
raises
all
sorts
of
different
concerns.
it's
one
thing
under
the
voting
rights
act
to
say
that
this
group
votes
as
a
bloc
and
has
been
discriminated
against
in
its
ability
to
elect
representatives
of
its
choice.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
two
different
minority
groups
are
put
together
because
they
share
some
particular
view
so
that
one
candidate
is
going
to
be
each
of
theirs
candidate
--
candidates
of
choice.
that
goes
quite
a
step
further
from
what
we
have
upheld
under
the
voting
rights
act.
and
here
you
are
have
of
the
district
court
creating
that
in
the
absence
of
any
state
expression
of
a
desire
to
create
that
type
of
--
of
district.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
new
district
33
was
drawn
as
a
minority
coalition
opportunity
district.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
read
any
way
other
than
saying
--
saying
when
we
sat
down
and
drew
it,
we
drew
this
one
as
a
minority
coalition
opportunity
district.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
when
you
are
saying
something
can
be
read
differently
than
that,
and
say
because
they
said
something
else
somewhere
else,
that
is
not
responsive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
why
--
why
do
you
care
--
why
do
they
care
then
that
it
was
drawn
as
a
minority
coalition
opportunity
district?
you
are
saying
they
didn't
do
that
at
all.
they
just
followed
precinct
lines
and
everything
else.
why
would
they
say
something?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
--
and
when
do
you
expect
our
decision
on
the
appeal
from
the
district
court
from
d.c.?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
do,
either.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
all
counsel,
i
appreciate
the
extraordinary
efforts
you
had
over
the
holiday
season.
thank
you
very
much.
the
case
is
submitted.
