justice

mr.
clement,
section
5
says
you
can't
draw
new
maps
unless
they
have
been
precleared.
you
can't
put
them
into
effect.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
only
thing
that
exists
is
old
maps
until
you
get
the
preclearance.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
give
deference
to
an
enacted
new
map,
if
section
5
says
don't
give
it
effect
until
its
been
precleared.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
asking
for
more
than
for
guidance.
you
are
asking
for
deference.
you
are
saying
they
have
to
start
with
the
new
map
even
though
that
map
hasn't
been
approved.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
instead
of
starting,
as
the
court
below
did,
with
the
old
map
which
had
been
approved.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
that
turn
section
5
on
its
head?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
district
is
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
district
is
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what's
was
the
problem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
that's
incomplete.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
not
sure
how
i
understand
that,
okay?
as
i
looked
at
one
of
the
el
paso
maps,
the
enacted
map
created
a
antler-type
district,
a
head
and
two
unconnected
antlers
on
top,
nothing
tying
them
together.
the
district
court
went
back
to
the
benchmark
and
said:
this
is
the
benchmark
district,
now
i'm
going
to
draw
the
districts
around
it
that
fall
naturally,
trying
to
stay
within
neutral
principles
of
not
dividing
up
the
city
more
than
i
have
to,
and
it
came
out
with
another
district.
i
don't
understand
what
principle,
what
legal
principle,
the
district
court
was
violating
that
makes
what
it
did
with
that
particular
county
wrong.
you're
saying
they
should
have
given
deference
to
an
oddly-shaped
district
that
changed
a
prior
benchmark
that's
been
challenged
as
having
been
created
specifically
to
minimize
the
latino
vote.
all
of
the
challenges
that
relate
to
el
paso
are
very
significant.
the
district
court
has
already
denied
summary
judgment
on
that.
tell
me
what
legal
principle
they
violated,
other
than
the
deference
principle
that
you're
relying
upon?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
you
are
saying
the
court
should
look
at
the
merits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
let's,
let's
go
to
something
justice
scalia
asked
was,
what
does
a
court
do
with
frivolous
claims?
does
it
assume
under
your
theory
that
those
frivolous
claims
are
valid?
and
if
you
say
no,
it
shouldn't
assume
that,
then
what
level
of
inquiry
should
the
court
engage
in
before
it
accepts
or
deviates
from
the
enacted
plan?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
texas
court
cannot
--
should
automatically
accept
all
--
that
every
district
that
a
challenge
has
been
raised
in
the
dc
circuit
court
is
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garza,
what's
the
real
drop-dead
date?
it's
not
november
6th,
because
that's
the
date
of
the
general
election.
what's
the
latest
election
--
primary
election
that
any
state
has?
june
26th?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so,
working
backwards
--
the
last--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
how
many
days
before
that
election
do
the
--
does
the
voting
mechanism
or
apparatus
need
to
set
up
the
voting
booths,
et
cetera?
