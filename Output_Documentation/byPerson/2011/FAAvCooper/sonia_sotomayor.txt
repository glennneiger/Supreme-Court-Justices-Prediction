justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
bit
confused
by
that,
because
in
your
brief,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
doe,
it
described
the
earlier
version
of
general
damages
in
the
following
way
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
your
brief
there:
"the
general
damages
provision
in
the
senate
bill
likely
derived
from
the
common
law
of
tort
of
invasion
of
privacy
where
general
damages
may
be
awarded
as.
"
--quote
--
""presumed
damages",
without
proof
of
harm.
"
so
i
think
there
in
doe
you
argued
that
general
damages
presumed
injury.
but
that's
very
different
than,
i
think,
the
question
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
you.
it's
--
and
i
read
your
brief
and
your
arguments
as
sort
of
an
--
an
assumption
that
if
you
suffer
nonpecuniary
harm,
you
haven't
been
injured.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
a
big
difference
between
presumed
damages
and
proven
injury.
in
gertz
we
reference
the
common
law
tort
as
requiring
actual
proof
of
injury
for
emotional
distress.
most
state
laws
say
you
have
to
prove
the
emotional
distress.
we
are
not
presuming
the
injury.
so,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
to
you,
aren't
you
the
one
confusing
what
injury
is
from
presumed
damage?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
that
different
from
actual
injury?
i
have
--
i'm
not
sleeping,
i
have
a
nervous
stomach,
i'm
not
eating.
the
typical
things
that
juries
look
at
to
determine
whether
you
have
proven
emotional
distress.
why
is
that
not
actual
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
looked
at
those
cases
and
in
all
of
them
except
for
two,
where
the
reference
wasn't
really
precise,
it
was
because
the
use
of
"actual
damages"
in
the
particular
statute
were
limited
to
pecuniary
harms
or
the
nature
of
the
harms
at
issue
were
pecuniary
by
nature.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
are
you
arguing
that
the
emotional
distress
component
can't
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
--
as
i
understand
the
definition
of
"special
damages"
in
common
law,
if
you
proved
any
pecuniary
harm
you
were
also
entitled
to
the
mental
distress
damages
as
well.
so
you
want
half
of
the
common
law
award
--
award?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
may
have
a
difference
of
history
there.
because,
yes,
special
damages
require
pecuniary
harm,
but
once
you
prove
that,
it
also
permitted
recovery
of
nonpecuniary
losses
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
that's
what
your
brief
said,
actually.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we're
not
talking
any
differently.
that's
what
i
just
said.
if
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--sort
of
odd
for
congress
to
borrow
from
the
defamation
context
and
with
a
defined
term
of
art,
"special
damages",
and
not
use
it
in
the
privacy
act
if
that's
what
it
intended.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
use
a
term
"actual
damages",
which
has
a
much
broader
meaning
than
"special
damages".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
statistics
on
the
percentage
of
actions
brought
under
the
privacy
act
in
which
the
plaintiff
was
able
to
establish
pecuniary
harm?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
aware
of
any
runaway
verdicts
based
on
awards
of
mental
damage
proof?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
define
runaway
awards
as
those
in
--
in
six
figures
or
above.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
even
high
five
figures.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
throughout
that
general
damages
meant
actual
damages,
when
general
damages,
in
my
understanding,
meant
two
things:
presumed
and
actual.
so
why
is
it
illogical
for
congress
to
look
at
what
general
damages
meant,
and
pick
the
meaning
that
included
proven
damages,
actual?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
still
confused.
general
damages
meant
presumed
or
actual.
congress
says
we
don't
want
general
damages
because
it
includes
presumed.
so
we
are
going
to
use
the
word
"actual".
how
do
you
get
from
that
that
congress
meant
"only
pecuniary"?
i
mean,
that
has
its
--
why
didn't
they
just
use
that?
instead
of
"actual
damages",
why
didn't
they
just
say
"pecuniary
damages",
if
that's
what
they
intended?
