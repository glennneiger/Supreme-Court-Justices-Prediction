what
--
what
the
government
would
say
is
--
is
that
--
and
they
have
their
own
dictionary
definitions,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
accurate
to
say
that
black's
law
dictionary
defines
actual
damages
the
way
you
would
have
it
defined.
as
i
recall,
their
briefing
gives
some
other
definitions
from
an
earlier
version
of
black's
or
whatever.
but
what
they
say
about
the
commission
understanding,
which
you
acknowledge
to
be
contrary
to
your
understanding
of
actual
damages,
what
they
say
is
that
at
least
shows
that
it
isn't
clear
what
actual
damages
means.
and
--
and
in
their
estimation,
once
you
--
once
you
establish
that
it
isn't
clear,
then
you
trigger
the
--
the
--
the
rule
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
will
not
be
considered
to
have
any
scope
except
that
scope
which
is
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
are
talking
about
statutes
that
require
that
the
material
have
been
made
public,
not
that
say
establish
a
violation
if
one
agency
provides
the
information
to
another
agency?
i
mean,
as
the
government
points
out,
this
statute
goes
far
beyond
any
--
any
state
statutory
or
common
law
protections
of
privacy.
it's
really
very
picky,
picky.
and
--
and
to
say
that,
you
know,
whatever
emotional
harm
comes
from
that
is
--
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
under
state
privacy
laws
emotional
distress
is
compensable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
but
all
you
have
to
know
is
that
you
shouldn't
give
it
to
the
other
agency,
because
you
are
not
making
it
public.
you
are
not
doing
the
kind
of
thing
that
constitutes
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
state
law.
you
just
failed,
intentionally
failed,
to
follow
the
very
detailed
and
as
i
say
picky,
picky
prescriptions
contained
in
the
privacy
act.
to
say
that
you
get
emotional
distress
for
that
as
opposed
to
genuine
--
what
i
would
call
genuine
privacy
incursions,
which
state
law
covers
is
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
ninth
circuit
for
--
for
many
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
long
time,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
a
different
point.
and
the
question
went
to
whether
you
acknowledge
the
name
to
be
unambiguous.
now
what
the
government
says
is,
of
course,
the
--
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
you
would
acknowledge
must
be
unambiguous,
but
the
government
says
further,
moreover,
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
--
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
unambiguous.
whether
you
have
waived
it
only
with
respect
to
pecuniary
damages
or
also
with
respect
to
emotional
harm,
that
also
must
be
unambiguous;
and
--
and
you
deny
that
second
step,
don't
you?
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
--
but
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
it's
made
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
think
it
was
authorizing
general
damages,
right?
because
it
set
up
this
commission
to
recommend
whether
general
damages
should
be
included.
now,
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
that
commission
if
indeed
actual
damages
already
included
general
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
would
say
that
actual
emotional
damages
are
not
--
are
not
general
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
--
it
does
use
the
term
"general
damages",
and
makes
very
clear
that
it
doesn't
think
this
statute
covers
general
damages.
so
i
think
--
i
think
you
have
to
argue
that
the
term
"general
damages"
includes
only
"presumed"
emotional
harm
and
not
"proven"
emotional
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
