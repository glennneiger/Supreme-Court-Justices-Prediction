john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cardozo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
argument
you
have
made,
and
i
certainly
understand
it,
that
this
is
the
privacy
act,
and
so
it's
precisely
these
types
of
damages
that
you
would
be
concerned
about,
really
cuts
both
ways.
i
mean,
what
you
are
saying
is
this
is
a
really
big
chunk
of
damages,
because
this
is
what
the
whole
act
was
about;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
suggests
that
there
is
some
weight
to
the
government's
point
that
well,
if
you
are
going
to
get
into
that,
you
really
do
need
a
clearer
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.

feigin,

case

justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1024,
faa
versus
cooper.
