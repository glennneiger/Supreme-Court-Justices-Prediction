justice

--are
there
instances
where,
if
there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
and
there
is
a
documented
trauma
from
psychosomatic
illness
with
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages,
is
that
special?
is
that
actual
damage?

--
but
we--
justice
anthony

--courts
don't
--
courts
allow
recovery
for
conjectural
or
speculative
damages.
that's
just
--
that's
just
or
am
i
wrong?
do
federal
courts--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--routinely
tell
juries,
now
you
can
come
in
with
conjectural
or
speculative
damages.
that's
not
the
way
the
jury
are
instructed.
justice
anthony

in
--
in
your
argument
do
you
have
to
avoid
the
concession
that
the
term
might
be
ambiguous?
i
know
your
position
is
that
liability
for
damages
is
expressly
waived,
but
then
you
stop
there,
and
you
--
and
you
say
that,
you
resist
the
idea
that
the
definition
of
actual
damages
has
to
be
unambiguous.
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
your
argument?
