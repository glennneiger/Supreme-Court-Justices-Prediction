justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
damages
that
your
client
is
seeking
in
this
case:
if
--
if
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit,
would
--
are
you
claiming
all
of
the
damages
that
--
all
of
the
emotional
damages
that
resulted
from
his
criminal
conviction,
or
are
you
claiming
only
the
emotional
damages
that
would
have
been
suffered
by
anybody
else
whose
records
were
turned
over
to
the
faa
under
the
operation
safe
pilot
program?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
allege
that
--
that
mr.
cooper
suffered
a
severe
emotional
distress
when
he
was
confronted
with
the
fact
that
his
records
had
been
turned
over.
so
you're
--
you're
saying
that
the
court
--
that
on
remand,
there
would
have
to
be
a
separation
of
the
degree
of
distress
that
he
suffered
as
a
result
of
simply
knowing
that
somebody
in
the
faa
had
access
to
his
social
security
records,
but
disregard
the
distress
that
somebody
in
that
situation
would
naturally
feel
when
confronted
with
the
fact
that
a
criminal
violation
that
he
had
committed
had
been
exposed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
agree
that
the
act
does
not
allow
recovery
for
what
would
have
been
regarded
at
common
law
as
general
damages?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
"general
damages",
that's
the
term
that
they
peeled
off,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
general
damages
is
a
term
from
--
from
the
remedies
in
defamation
cases,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
there
are
two
types
of
damages
in
defamation
cases,
special
damages
and
general
damages
and
if
you
--
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
subtract
general
damages
and
what
do
you
have
left?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
problem
is
that
--
that
your
definition
of
actual
damages
and
the
general
definition
of
actual
damages
includes
some
things
that
fell
within
the
rubric
of
general
damages.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
just
try
this
one
more
time.
you
--
you
say
that
there
is
a
right
to
recover
actual
damages
but
no
right
to
recover
general
damages.
so
what
you
think
is
recoverable
is
actual
damages
minus
general
damages?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
this
were
a
common
lawsuit
for
slander
per
quod,
and
what
was
said
was
that
mr.
cooper
received
social
security
disability
benefits.
now,
he
would
--
and
he
claims
that
causes
him
great
distress
because
of
the
extrinsic
fact
that
he
was
known
to
be
a
pilot,
and
therefore,
people
who
--
who
knew
that
he
was
flying
around
an
airplane
even
though
he
was
so
severely
disabled
that
he
was
entitled
to
get
social
security
disability
benefits,
that
would
damage
his
reputation.
now,
the
damages
that
you're
seeking,
the
emotional
distress
that
he
allegedly
incurred,
what
would
that
be?
which
--
under
what
category
of
damages
would
that
fall?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
let's--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
don't
claim
any
economic
loss
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
under
the
--
would
that
be
the
term
that
a
court
--
a
common
law
court
would
use:
actual
damages?
wouldn't
they
ask
whether
the
damages
to
his
reputation
and
the
emotional
distress
that
he
suffered
therefrom
were
either
--
wouldn't
they
ask
whether
that
was
special
or
general?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
gertz
came
after
the
common
law.
gertz
was
a
modification
of
the
common
law.
what
would
it
be
at
common
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
general
damages
here
are
excluded
by
congress,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
plaintiff,
who
sues
the
federal
government
under
the
privacy
act,
may
recover
damages
for
nonpecuniary
injuries.
respondent
is
a
pilot
who
intentionally
withheld
from
the
federal
aviation
administration
information
about
his
hiv
diagnosis
in
order
to
procure
a
medical
certificate
at
a
time
when
the
agency
did
not
issue
medial
certificates
to
pilots
with
hiv.
respondent's
failure
to
report
his
condition
was
discovered
in
the
course
a
joint
criminal
investigation
by
the
department
of
transportation,
which
is
the
faa's
current
agency,
and
the
social
security
administration.
when
the
investigation
revealed
that
respondent
had
obtained
social
security
disability
benefits,
but
had
nevertheless
renewed
his
medical
certificate,
he
admitted
that
he
had
deliberately
failed
to
disclose
information
about
his
condition
to
the
faa.
he
eventually
pleaded
guilty
to
making
and
delivering
a
false
official
writing.
he
then
brought
this
suit
against
the
agencies
involved
in
the
investigation.
he
claims
that
the
disclosure
of
his
confidential
medical
information
to
the
department
of
transportation
violated
the
privacy
act,
causing
him
mental
and
emotional
distress.
the
privacy
act
authorizes
aggrieved
individuals
to
recover
"actual
damages"
from
the
government
for
intentional
or
willful
violation,
but
the
acts
does
not
define
actual
damages.
relying
on
the
sovereign
immunity
canon
which
holds
that
the
scope
of
sovereign
immunity
waivers
must
be
restrictly
construed
in
the
government's
favor,
the
district
court
held
that
the
term
"actual
damages"
is
facially
ambiguous
and
that
as
a
result,
respondent
could
not
recover
for
his
alleged
nonpecuniary
harm.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
however,
holding
that
in
the
context
of
the
privacy
act
the
meaning
of
"actual
damages"
is
clear
and
that
it
includes
mental
and
emotional
distress.
for
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
privacy
act
does
not
unmistakably
authorize
damages
for
mental
and
emotional
distress.
we
are
most
persuaded
by
what
congress
did
not
authorize
to
be
recovered
for
privacy
act
violations.
congress
deliberately
excluded
general
damages
from
the
act.
in
common
law
defamation
and
privacy
cases,
general
damages
compensate
for
nonpecuniary
harm,
including
mental
and
emotional
distress
and
need
not
be
proved.
the
only
other
category
of
compensatory
damages
in
those
common
law
torts
is
special
damages
which
are
limited
to
actual
pecuniary
loss
and
must
be
proved.
because
congress
refused
to
authorize
general
damages,
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
congress
intended
the
term
"actual
damages"
under
the
privacy
act
to
mean
special
damages.
respondent's
contrary
reading
of
the
act
is
not
unreasonable,
but
because
congress
did
not
speak
unequivocally,
the
sovereign
immunity
can
and
dictates
that
we
adopt
an
interpretation
of
actual
damages
limited
to
proven
pecuniary
loss.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
in
this
case.
