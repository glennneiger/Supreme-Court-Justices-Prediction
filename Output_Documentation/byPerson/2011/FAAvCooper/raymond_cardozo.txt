mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
embracing
the
government's
view
of
"actual
damages"
would
mean
that
the
very
individuals
congress
sought
to
protect
in
this
act
would
have
no
remedy
at
all
for
the
primary
form
of
harm
that
was
well
recognized
at
common
law
when
this
act
was
passed.
to
carry
out
the
act's
protective
purposes,
this
court
need
only
give
the
words
"actual
damages"
their
common
and
ordinary
meaning
that
appears
in
black's
law
dictionary:
"proven,
not
presumed,
liquidated,
punitive,
or
other
forms
of
damages
that
are
not
tied
to
proof
of
harm.
"
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
if
you
affirm,
there
will
be
a
proximate
causation
question
that
arises
on
remand.
the
act
requires
the
damages
to
be
the
result
of
the
violation.
so
he
cannot
recover
for
the
emotional
distress
that
followed
from
the
prosecution.
but
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
we're
talking
today
not
just
about
mr.
cooper;
we're
talking
about
every
single
person
to
whom
this
act
applies:
the
whistleblower
who
the
government
chooses
to
silence
by
embarrassing
and
humiliating
them--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--yes.
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
judges
routinely
have
to
sort
through.
for
example,
someone
suffers
emotional
distress
and
then
they
lose
their
job
thereafter,
and
the
injury
that
produces
the
emotional
distress,
the
job
--
the
job
loss
wasn't
the
proximate
cause.
judges
--
in
fact,
we
ask
juries
to
do
that.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
a
judge
sifting
through
that
and
making
that
determination.
as
happened
in
petitioner
doe's
case,
the
judge
could
find
that
the
emotional
distress
claim
wasn't
sufficient
and
reject
it
altogether,
but
that's
the
nature
of
an
emotional
distress
remedy.
one
thing
you
didn't
hear
in
that
argument
almost
at
all
was
any
discussion
of
the
text
of
this
act,
which
tells
you
in
at
least
four
separate
ways
that
"actual
damages"
simply
means
proven,
not
presumed,
damages.
beginning
with
the
words
themselves,
that's
of
course
the
most
common
meaning
of
actual
damages,
is
the
one
that
appears
in
black's
law
dictionary.
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out,
the
term
of
art
for
economic
loss
in
this
arena
is
"special
damages".
if
that's
what
congress
meant,
presumably
it
would
have
used
that
term,
it's
the
more
common
way
to
express
one
category
of
damages
only
that's
economic.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
what
would
have
been
regarded
at
common
law
as
presumed
--
the
presumed
damages,
this
act
doesn't
allow.
that
was
peeled
off
for
further
study.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
right.
but
by
keeping
actual,
the
juxtaposition
between
actual
and
general--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--yes.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
correct.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
but
the
interesting
thing
in
this
case
is
they
didn't
take
what
you
have
left,
special
damages,
and
they
used
a
different
term,
congress
did,
"actual",
a
term
that
suggests
we
are
going
to
require
proof
of
the
damages.
we
are
not
going
to
presume
them,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
speculative
damages.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
that's
true.
but
several
other
things
in
the
text
of
the
act
tell
you,
again,
that
actual
means
simply
proven,
not
presumed.
if
you
look
at
section
2,
where
congress
recites
findings
and
the
statement
of
purposes
for
the
act,
the
right
that's
being
described
here
is
an
individual
and
personal
right
to
privacy,
well
understood,
well
settled
at
the
time
to
be
a
right
that
was
primarily
nonpecuniary
in
nature.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
no.
our
position
is
what
is
recoverable
is
actual
damages,
damages
you
prove,
substantiate,
a
judge
can
reject
it
if
they
find
it
unsubstantiated
as
happened
in
petitioner
doe's
case--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--but
you
can't
presume--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--no,
but
this--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--but
you
can
in
this
arena
at
common
law
presume
damages
from
the
nature
of
the
violation.
that
is
what
was
carved
out,
the
ability
to
presume
it,
rather
than
present
evidence
and
subject
it
to
proof.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
apart
from
the
obvious
that
the
post
enactment
report
was--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--but
--
but
--
on
the
underlying
point--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--several
things.
the
commission
--
this
is
a
--
two
paragraphs
in
a
620-page
report
that
doesn't
run
through
the
text
of
the
act,
it's
purpose,
all
of
the
things
that
one
normally
does
in
statutory
construction.
so
where
they
draw
this
conclusion
is
entirely--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--yes,
with
one
other
--
with
one
other
proviso
i
would
add.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
ambiguity.
you
see
the
privacy
commission
in
this
two
pages
was
trying
to
sell
congress
on
the
notion
of
expanding
the
remedy,
so
it
wrote
on
pages
530
of
its
reports:
"if
the
rights
and
interests
established
of
the
privacy
act
are
worthy
of
protection,
then
recovery
from
intangible
injuries
such
as
pain
and
suffering,
loss
of
reputation,
or
the
chilling
effect
on
constitutional
rights
is
a
part
of
that
protection.
"
"there
is
evidence
for
this
proposition
in
common
law
privacy
cases.
"
surely,
congress
knew
that
very
thing.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
right.
surely,
congress
knew
that
same
thing,
so
when
it
enacted
this
act,
it
did
not
mean
to
cut
out
the
primary
form
of
harm.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
another--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--well,
that's
why
it's
critical
to
understand
the
analysis,
because
you
can't
say
there
is
a
genuine
ambiguity
unless
you
understand
how
they
arrived
at
that
conclusion.
the
meaning
of
actual
damages
can
vary
with
the
context,
but
it's
usually
crystal
clear
in
each
context
what
you
are
talking
about.
in
this
privacy
context,
it's
fairly
clear,
we
have
a
provision
at
page
66a
of
the
appendix,
section
2b,
where
congress
recites
of
purpose
of
this
remedies
provision,
and
it
states:
"the
purpose
is
to
hold
the
united
states
liable
for
any
damages
which
occur
as
a
result
of.
"
the
notable
thing
about
that
statement
of
purpose,
which
occur
as
a
result
of,
lines
up
precisely
with
proven,
not
presumed
damages.
but
any
damages
which
occur
as
a
result
of,
conflicts
directly
with
the
notion
of
only
one
category
of
damages
as
being
authorized.
that's
congress'
statement
of
purpose
for
this
very
provision.
that
aligns.
mr.
cooper's
construction
aligns.
the
government
creates
disharmony
in
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
justice
breyer,
you
have
given
me
a
little
bit
too
much
credit,
i
can't
give
you
a
number
of
states,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
that
disallows.
it
is
by
far
the
general
rule
and
i
think
it's
universal
that
recovery
of
mental
and
emotional
distress
for
invasion
of
the
privacy.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
i
don't
know
that.
so,
i'll--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--yes,
but
we
are
here
today
only
talking
about
the
narrow
category
of
cases
in
which
there
is
an
intentional
and
willful
violation.
so
they
knew
the
law
prevented
them
from
doing
what
they
did.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
but
--
but
this
provision
is
covering
the
range
of
intentional
and
willful
violations
covered
in
the
act.
the
example
of
the
whistleblower
who
you
want
to
silence,
so
you
leak
the
most
embarrassing
details
to
the
press,
shaming
and
humiliating
them
in
front
of
friends
and
family
--
don't
leave
the
house
for
a
month,
but
you
haven't
lost
your
job,
and
you
are
not
out
of
pocket
--
zero
remedy,
zero.
that's
the
government's
construction.
and
look
at
section
2,
how
congress
described
this
act.
they
didn't
say
we're
imposing
some
picayune
technical
requirements.
they
are
saying
we're
doing
this
to
safeguard
individual
rights
of
privacy.
they
use
the
very
lingo;
they
analogize
it
unmistakably
and
explicitly
to
the
common
law
kind
of
invasion
of
privacy
for
which
emotional
distress
is
routinely
recoverable.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
i
don't
have
any
statistics
on
that.
the
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
that
this
has
been
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
for
well
over
30
years,
and
as
the
government
--
and
prior
to
doe
v.
chao
the
rule
was,
in
most
circuits,
you
didn't
have
to
show
any
damages.
and
yet
at
that
point,
a
good
37
years
after
the
act
had
come
into
existence,
the
government
sat
up
here
and
admitted
that
far
broader
construction
of
the
act
than
we
are
talking
about
today
had
no
meaningful
effect
on
the
public--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--this
case
is
--
in
--
coming
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
but
the
fifth
circuit
passed
the
rule.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
in
the
early
'80s
it
first
recognized
emotional
distress.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--no.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
the
highest
i
can
think
of
in
the
moment
was
a
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
called
jacobs
in
which
a
federal
agency
revealed
--
leaked
to
the
press
information
falsely
suggesting
a
bank
president
was
a
money
launderer.
he
got
100,000
in
emotional
distress,
but
that's
a
pretty
extreme
situation.
the
vast
majority,
it's
going
to
be
modest.
and
i
would
say
he
should
get
$100,000
in
emotional
distress.
he's
an
upstanding
member
of
the
community
and
he's
being
called
a
common
criminal;
he
may
not
have
suffered
any
pecuniary
loss,
but
he
has
suffered
actual
damages.
one
other
thing
about
the
text
that
tells
you
--
again,
all
of
these
points,
points
aligned
with
mr.
cooper's
construction
and
produce
disharmony
to
the
other
side.
look
at
the
breadth
of
the
language
that
congress
used
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
subsection
(g)
of
the
act.
recall
that
the
government's
construction
is
only
one
small
category
of
plaintiffs,
who
are
the
victims
of
intentional
and
willful
violations,
can
recover.
yet
the
text
says
in
any
suit
in
which
a
court
determines
that
there's
been
intentional
and
willful
violation,
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
actual
damages.
if
what
we
mean
is
only
one
small
category,
economic
damages,
is
serving
as
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
category
of
cases
that
could
be
brought,
you
would
expect
to
see
that
limitation
appear
after
the
intentional
and
willful
in
any
suit
in
which
the
court
determines
there
has
been
willful,
intentional
violation
and
the
plaintiff
has
suffered
economic
loss;
because
it
is
a
substantially
narrowing
term.
however,
if
actual
damages
simply
means
proven,
not
presumed,
this
wording
is
perfectly
natural
and
flows
exactly.
again,
every
place
you
look
in
the
text
of
the
act,
proven
not
presumed
--
aligns.
"economic
only"
is
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
in
the
text
of
this
act.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
i
would
modify
it
slightly.
what
the
government
is
talking
about
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
abstract.
they
are
lifting
the
two
words
out
of
the
context
of
the
act.
like
any
phrase,
actual
damages
can
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
but
in
this
statute,
when
you
run
through
the
tools
of
construction,
it's
not
ambiguous;
and
that's
--
that's--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--actually
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
and
this
is
how
i
would
clarify
it.
what
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
requires
is
that
the
waiver
be
expressed
in
text
and
the
court
can't
read
it
in,
it
can't
add
words
to
the
text.
if
you
--
if
your
intent
is
to
separate
out
presumed
liquidated,
punitive,
other
forms
of
damages
that
do
not
--
are
not
tethered
to
proof
of
harm,
actual
damages
is
a
phrase
that
does
that
precisely
because
that's
what
actual
means;
it
means
real.
there
is
no
ordinary
definition
of
actual
where
it
means
pecuniary
only,
that
is
--
you
get
when
you
use
it
in
certain
contexts.
so
this
court
doesn't
need
to
add,
expand
or
read
anything
into
these
words
"actual
damages".
it
simply
needs
to
give
them
the
meaning
that
they
have
in
ordinary
english
definitions,
in
black's
law
definition.
this
definition
this
court
gave
to
actual
damages
in
the
birdsall
case
over
100
years
ago
is
the
same
thing:
presumed
--
proven
damages,
not
presumed.
so
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
here
expressed;
it
doesn't
arise
by
implication.
but
the
one
--
but
there's
another
side
to
the
sovereign
immunity
point
that
the
government
never
mentions.
the
court's
obligation
is
dual
here.
when
there
has
been
a
waiver,
the
court
can't
expand
that
waiver,
but
neither
can
it
contract
it.
you
have
here
the
government
spinning
out
theoretical
--
theoretical
possibilities
that
actual
damages
was
--
was
used
in
this
more
peculiar
sense;
what
it
really
meant
was
special
damages
--
to
produce
a
deconstruction
of
the
statute
that
eviscerates
it,
leaves
most
of
the
people
who
suffer
intentional,
willful
violation
without
any
remedy
at
all.
and
those
who
have
it,
to
have
an
economic
loss,
do
not
get
compensation
for
the
primary
form
of
harm
from
a
privacy--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--absolutely,
but
--
but
that
circles
back
to
my
point
that
if
you're
going
to
--
if
your
intent
is
to
say
presumed,
not
proven,
actual
fits
exactly.
special
is
the
term
that
wasn't
used
here.
so
to
--
to
fault
congress
for
picking
a
term
that
means
precisely
"proven,
not
presumed",
and
say
you
weren't
clear
enough,
that's
asking
too
much,
particularly
when
they
also
said,
in
their
statement
of
purpose,
they
spoke
to
the
remedies
provision
and
said
"any
damages
which
occur
as
a
result
of.
"
they
used
a
sweepingly
broad
language.
they
did
multiple
things
to
say
--
reveal
no
doubt
about
its
intent.
and
recall
the
rule
from
the
morisette
and
molzof
case,
case
when
congress
is
legislating
against
a
common
law
background.
the
rule
is
if
congress's
silence
is
taken
as
an
indication
that
congress
intends
to
follow
established
norms,
not
depart
from
them,
when
congress
says
actual
damages
in
a
privacy
context,
it's
fair
to
--
it's
going
to
assume
that
people
are
going
to
understand
that
at
common
law,
actual
damages
included
emotional
distress
for
privacy
violations.
so
rather
than
assuming
that
it
departed
from
the
common
law,
we
typically
require
the
contrary
direction,
under
morisette
and
molzof,
and
we
don't
have
that
contrary
direction
here.
and
you
get
the
same
answer
as
you
roll
through.
you
don't
need
to
look
--
go
past
the
text,
but
you
get
the
same
answer
as
you
roll
through
all
of
the
tools
of
construction:
the
common
law
background
and
the
morisette
molzof
rule
points
you
to
the
same
place.
the
legislative
history.
this
act,
the
act
that
emerged,
was
a
compromise
between
a
far
broader
remedial
scheme
that
authorized
punitive
damages,
did
not
have
the
intentional
and
willful
requirement,
had
a
negligence
standard,
and
a
more
measured
version.
the
government's
construction
of
this
act
throws
that
compromise
out
of
the
window
and
rewrites
the
act
as
a
one-sided
in
the
government's
favor
when
what
clearly
happened
in
the
legislature
was
that
a
balance
was
struck.
another
thing
about
the
legislative
history.
both
the
house
and
senate
bills
originally
had
the
term
"actual
damages"
in
there
from
the
start,
and
they
both
had
"actual
damages"
simply
as
a
counterpart
to
punitive
damages.
again,
another
confirmation.
actual
damages.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
his
--
his
economic
loss
would
be
special
damages.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
the
damages
he
could
prove--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--right.
the
damages
he
could
prove
would
be
actual
damages.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
well,
they
could
also
use
actual
damages,
because
of
course,
in
the
gertz
case,
the
court--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--at
--
at
common
law,
it
would
be
general
damages,
but--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--they
were
referred
for
further
study,
but
what
was
authorized
in
the
text,
the
substantive
provision,
is
actual
damages,
not
special
damages.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
peel
off
the
whole
piece
and
require
only
economic
loss,
the
more
common
and
routine
term
of
art
that
is
used
is
special
damages,
which
circles
back
to
another
important
point--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--it
doesn't
include
general
damages.
they
were
called
presumed
damages.
presumed
damages.
a
substantial
portion
of
the
compensation
ordinarily
available
would
be
peeled
off
under
our
construction.
and
this
was
a
distinction
that
actually
appeared
in
the
gertz
case
--
where
it
placed
first
amendment
limitations
on
recovery,
the
court
distinguished
between
actual
damages
and
presumed
damages.
so--
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
--i
wouldn't
say
--
i
would
say
you
could
call
them
general
damages.
in
the
context
of
this
act,
what
congress
does
not
choose
special
damages
as
the
term
of
what
it's
authorizing,
and
instead
chooses
the
broader
term,
"actual
damages".
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
that
--
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
raymond
a.
cardozo
and
the
thing
i
would
add
to
that
is
general
damages
--
actual
damages
was
in
the
statute
long
before
general
damages
surfaced.
it
appeared
at
the
11th
hour,
and
congress
just
said
let's
send
that
off
to
the
commission.
that's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
because
it
creates
a
huge
question
about
what
congress
meant
to
peel
off.
there
is
no
explanation
of
general
damages.
it
isn't
defined.
and
it
arose
at
the
11th
hour.
but
the
important
thing
is
the
term
it
kept
in
the
statute
was
not
"special
damages".
the
term
of
art
that
has
a
pecuniary
limitation.
it
kept
the
broader
term
"actual
damages",
and
the
term
it
kept
aligns
with
its
statement
of
purpose,
the
breadth
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
a
nonpecuniary
expression
--
a
desire
to
protect
nonpecuniary
interests
that's
throughout
the
act.
let
me
wrap
up
with
a
couple
of
observations
here.
congress
passed
this
act
to
restore
the
citizens'
faith
in
their
government,
and
it
made
a
solemn
promise
to
the
american
citizens
that
in
cases
of
intentional
and
willful
violation,
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
for
actual
damages.
today,
the
government
is
proposing
that
"actual
damages"
be
read
in
a
way
that
renders
this
act
virtually
irrelevant.
that
makes
a
mockery
of
that
solemn
promise.
to
preserve
the
vitality
of
this
act,
this
court
need
only
give
actual
damages
its
most
common
and
ordinary
meaning:
"proven,
not
presumed".
