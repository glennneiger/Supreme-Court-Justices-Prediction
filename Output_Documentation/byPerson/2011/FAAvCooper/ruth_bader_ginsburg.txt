then
maybe
congress
shouldn't
have
passed
this
statute.
but
the
injury,
the
invasion
of
privacy,
that's
not
something
where
pecuniary
damages
are
--
are
prime
if
they
exist
at
all.
i
mean,
this
is
--
the
--
the
tort
that
this
is
comparable
to
is
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
the
--
the
person
who
is
subject
to
this,
to
this
embarrassment,
this
humiliation,
doesn't
have
out-of-pocket
costs,
but
is
terribly
distressed,
nervous,
anxious,
and
all
the
rest.
the
--
the
act
that
the
congress
is
reaching,
the
impact
of
it
is
of
that
nature,
not
--
i
mean
pecuniary
damages,
you
know,
ordinarily
attend
conduct
that
embarrasses,
humiliates
you,
causes
mental
distress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
it
is
--
even
if
it
is,
the
damages
are
--
the
damages
are
not
of
a
pecuniary
kind.
so
you
could
say
that
congress
was
much
more
generous
than
the
common
law
was,
but
the
impact
on
the
person
who
is
suing
is
not
going
to
be
out-of-pocket
business
loss,
pecuniary
loss;
it's
going
to
be
the
embarrassment,
the
humiliation.
so
it's
--
it's
--
if
congress
wanted
to
do
something
about
the
impact
on
the
person
it
has
given
a
right,
it's
not
going
to
do
something
that
has
to
do
with
pecuniary
damages
it's
not
likely
the
person
in
--
in
this
plaintiff's
situation
is
not
likely
to
suffer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
--
why
--
is
it
--
is
a
harm
to
a
dignitary
interest,
is
that
an
actual
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
describe
that
injury.
i
mean
there
is
an
injury,
the
emotional
distress,
humiliation;
is
that
an
actual
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
this
case.
did
the
plaintiff
suffer
an
actual
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
st
least,
did
he
allege
that
he
had
suffered
an
actual
injury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
did
he
suffer
an
actual
injury,
as
opposed
to
someone
who
is
complaining
about
something
--
an
abstract
right
or
an
abstract
theory?
is
there
an
actual
injury
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
to
have
an
injury
first
before
you
can
get
damages,
so
my
question
is
was
there
an
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
"actual
damages"
mean
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
can
mean,
and
i
think
it
has
been
held
to
mean,
damages
to
a
dignitary
interest.
mental
distress
has
been
held
to,
the
term
has
been
held
to
mean
that
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
discussing
what
the
term
means,
what
the
term
"actual
damages"
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
--
the
privacy
study
commission
coming
after
can't
say
what
the
statute
means.
i
mean,
that
would
be
post-legislative
history.
i
mean,
the
statute
exists
and
then
we
have
a
study
commission
to
see
what
amendments
might
be
made.
but
the
study
commission
can't
decide
what
the
act
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
just
saying
that
he
didn't
have
a
good
claim
for
relief.
but
let's
take
the
worst
case,
where
--
where
a
government
official
spreads
all
kinds
of
false
information,
or
even
true
but
terribly
embarrassing
information
about
a
person,
does
it
deliberately.
let's
take
that
case,
because
your
rule
covers
all
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
that
the
very
thing
that
congress
--
why
did
they
pass
this
in
the
first
place?
i
mean,
congress
was
thinking
of
emotional
distress
injuries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
did
set
a
pretty
high
bar
for
the
plaintiff
to
meet,
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
intentional
or
willful
conduct,
not
negligence,
but--
