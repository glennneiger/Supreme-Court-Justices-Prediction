mr.
eric
j.
feigin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
congress
had
intended
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
allow
uncapped
emotional
distress
claims
under
the
privacy
act,
it
would
have
and
was
required
to
state
that
waiver
clearly
and
unambiguously
in
the
statutory
text.
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
act
sweep
far
beyond
any
pre-existing
common
law
protection
of
privacy
to
impose
a
detailed
set
of
new
and
pervasive
requirements
on
the
collection,
maintenance,
use
and
dissemination
of
millions
of
federal
agency
records.
the
act,
for
example,
forbids
agencies
from
keeping
too
much
information
about
an
individual,
compels
agencies
to
collect
information
about
an
individual,
when
practicable,
from
the
individual
himself
and
not
from
other
sources,
and
can
require
agencies
to
safeguard
information
about
an
individual
even
when
that
information
is
otherwise
already
publicly
available.
congress
would
not
have
taken
lightly
the
question
of
whether
to
expose
the
united
states
to
expansive
damages
for
intentional
or
willful
violations
of
these
novel
recordkeeping
requirements.
indeed,
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
believes
that
the
social
security
administration
violated
the
privacy
act
in
this
case
is
something
that
never
would
have
been
actionable
at
common
law
and
never
would
have
resulted
in
emotional
distress
recovery.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
like
to
respectfully
disagree
with
the
premise
of
the
question
that
the
privacy
act
is
comparable
to
common
law
invasion
of
privacy.
all
the
requirements
i
just
described
that
are
under
the
privacy
act
would
not
have
existed
at
common
law
invasion
of
privacy
even
though
common
law
invasion
of
privacy
was,
as
you
say,
compensable
with
emotional
distress
awards.
in
fact,
even
if
we
focus
just
on
the
disclosure-related
provision
of
the
privacy
act,
it
itself
is
much
broader
than
common
law
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
there
sometimes
are,
as
there
were
at
common
law,
pecuniary
damages
resulting
from
either
violation
of
the
privacy
act
or
invasions
of
privacy;
and
the
government
sometimes
pays
out
very
large
pecuniary
judgments.
but
to
get
to
the
core
of
your
question
about
why
congress
might
not
in
the
privacy
act
have
provided
an
emotional
distress
award,
i
think
the
text
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
congress
thought
about
the
possibility
of
providing
an
emotional
distress
award,
but
decided
not
to
do
that
in
the
initial
version
of
the
act
that
it
passed
in
1974.
instead,
that
version
of
the
act
in
section
5(c)(2)(b)(iii)
assigned
to
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
the
task
of
making
a
recommendation
as
to
whether
the
act
should
later
be
expanded
to
provide
for
general
damages.
the
commission
understood
its
mission
to
--
was
to
determine
whether
the
act
ought
to
be
expanded
to
provide
for
dignitary
and
reputational
harms,
such
as
compensation
for
emotional
distress.
and
the
privacy
commission
further
understood
that
the
act
as
it
had
been
enacted
provided
only
for
actual
damages,
which
it
interpreted
as
synonymous
with
special
damages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
the
term
"actual
injury"
and
the
term
"actual
damages",
those
are
ambiguous
terms.
sometimes
they
might
include
emotional
distress
and
sometimes
they
might
not.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
he
did
not--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--he
did
not
suffer
actual
damages
within
the
meaning
of
the
privacy
act.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
my
difficulty
with
the
question
is
that
i
don't
think
the
term
"actual
injury"
has
some
plain
meaning
out
of
context.
and
the
term
that
the
privacy
act
uses
is
actual
damages.
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
privacy
act,
as
well
as
in
other
contexts--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
if
your
honor's
question
is
whether
he
suffered
an
adverse
effect
within
the
meaning
of
section
(g)(1)(b)
of
the
act--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes,
we
believe
he
did
suffer
an
adverse
effect
sufficient
to
confer
standing.
but
this
court
in
doe
described
the
adverse
effect
requirement
as
simply
codifying
the
article
iii
standing
requirements
and
made
very
clear
that
simply
because
a
plaintiff
may
have
suffered
an
adverse
effect
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
plaintiff
suffered
actual
damages.
but
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
hope
not,
your
honor.
but
the
--
the
--
i
think
to
get
at
your
question,
what
we
said
in
the
doe
brief
is
that
general
damages
are
a
type
of
presumed
damages,
and
that's
correct
under
the
common
law,
but
that
isn't
all
that
general
damages
encompasses.
general
damages,
as
the
court
recognized
in
doe,
are
always
presumed,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
always
assumed
--
this
is
the
common
law
definition
of
general
damages
--
are
always
presumed
in
the
sense
that
they
are
always
assumed
to
have
taken
place
and
an
award
of
general
damages
can
be
made
even
without
proof
of
specific
harm.
but
in
cases
where
a
--
at
common
law,
in
cases
where
a
plaintiff
did
introduce
evidence
of
the
extent
of,
for
example,
the
emotional
distress
that
he
had
suffered.
so
if
he
wanted
to
say
i
am
not
happy
with
the
presumed
damages
that
you
would
give
to
just
anybody
who
had
suffered
this
invasion
of
privacy,
i
have
a
particularly
sterling
reputation
or
i
am
particularly
sensitive
to
this
sort
of
thing,
i
suffered
a
--
an
increased
amount
of
harm
from
what
you
might
presume
the
average
person
would
suffer,
the
award
that
that
person
would
receive
is--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
the
award
that
person
would
receive
for
the
additional
proof
of
emotional
distress
would
be
classified
as
general
damages.
now,
to
get
to
your
question
as
to
why
that
is
not
actual
damages.
sometimes
the
terms
"actual
damages"
or
"actual
injury"
can
be
used
to
include
proven
emotional
distress,
but
the
term
is
ambiguous.
we
cite
cases
in
footnotes
1
and
2
of
our
reply
brief
in
which
the
term
"actual
damages"
or
"actual
damage"
is
used
to
mean
exclusively
pecuniary
harm.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
most
of
those
cases
are
cases
out
of
the
common
law
and
sometimes
they
used
"actual
damages"
in
the
same
sentence
with
a
reference
to
emotional
harm,
making
clear
that
they
think
that
the
two
types
of
harms
are
separate.
but,
your
honor,
maybe
i
can
try
to
explain
it
this
way.
i
think
actually
respondent
implicitly
agrees
with
our
definition
of
general
damages
as
including
proven
harm.
if
you
look
at
footnote
2
on
page
20
of
the
red
brief
and
then
again
at
page
22
of
the
red
brief,
the
definition
of
"actual
damages"
that
respondent
is
offering,
he
divides
into
two
subcategories:
special
damages
and
general
damages.
everybody
agrees
that
special
damages
are
limited
to
pecuniary
harm,
and
respondent
makes
no
claim,
nor
could
he,
that
the
type
of
damages
he
is
seeking
are
special
damages.
so
to
the
extent
he
thinks
that
he
is
entitled
to
recovery
under
the
act,
it's
because
he
thinks
that
the
emotional
distress
harm
that
he
wants
to
prove
are
general
damages.
and
if
there's
one
thing
we
know
about
the
definition
of
"actual
damages"
in
the
act,
it's
that
it
doesn't
include
general
damages,
because
again
congress
separately
in
the
text
of
the
privacy
act
assigned
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
to
make
a
recommendation
about
whether
the
act
should
later
be
expanded
to
include
general
damages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
we
don't
have
a
position
on
that
at
this
point.
i
can
describe
to
you
how
we
think
that
the
inquiry
would
work.
we
think
that
in
some
statutes
actual
damages
might
in
context
include
emotional
distress
awards.
but
the
term
"actual
damages"
by
itself
in
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver
of
the
united
states'
sovereign
immunity
for
claims
of
emotional
distress.
and
as
for
statutes
which
do
not
allow
claims
against
the
united
states,
it
would
be
a
question
of
context
and
legislative
history.
and
we
would
have
to
do
the
same
kind
of
workup
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
that
we
have
done
of
the
privacy
act
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
your
honor.
multiple
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that,
and
we
are
not
questioning
that
conclusion
for
purposes
of
this
case
with
the
caveat
that
we
don't
think
the
united
states
is
subject
to
suit
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act.
if
the
united
states
were
subject
to
suit
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
then
because
there
is
ambiguity
about
the
meaning
of
actual
damages,
we
think
that
the
narrower
interpretation
as
limited
to
pecuniary
harm
would
control.
one
other
distinction
between
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
and
the
privacy
act
is
again,
as
i
said,
the
privacy
act
specifically
carves
out
general
damages
as
a
type
of
damages
that
aren't
going
to
be
awarded
and
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
does
not.
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
also
has
a
much
more
permissive
remedial
scheme,
allowing
in
certain
cases
for
statutory
damages
and
also
allowing
for
punitive
damages.
i
don't
think
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
for
the
various
reasons
i
have
just
mentioned,
is
a
particularly
good
analog
for
the
privacy
act.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
again,
as
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
brief
--
i
think
again,
i'd
refer
the
court
to
footnotes
1
and
2
for
how
this
term
was
used
in
the
common
law
--
the
term
"actual
damages"
can
mean
both
things.
so
the
fact
that
in
the
privacy
act
it
does
--
it
may
include
emotional
distress
awards
doesn't
mean
that
that's
the
sense
in
which
congress
used
it
in
the
privacy
act
--
i'm
sorry;
i
may
have
said
that
wrong.
the
fact
that
in
the
context
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
it
may
include
emotional
distress
doesn't
mean
that
that's
the
way
in
which
congress
used
it
in
the
privacy
act.
and
i
think--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
documented
medical
expenses
that
were
out-of-pocket
expenses,
then
we
think,
even
if
they
arise
from
emotional
distress,
they
would
be
pecuniary
harm
and
could
be
compensated
under
the
privacy
act.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
the
emotional
distress
component
itself
cannot
be,
but
medical
expenses
to
treat
symptoms
of
emotional
distress--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
don't
think
that's
quite
correct
about
the
definition
of
"special
damages",
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
on
this.
"special
damages",
the
term
in
this
context
is
always
limited
to
pecuniary
harm.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
in
a
common
law
suit
for
defamation
for--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
no,
your
honor.
what
we
said
in
our
brief
is
in
a
common
lawsuit
for
defamation
per
quod
there
are
two
types
of
damages
that
could
be
recovered,
special
damages
and
general
damages.
and
once
a
--
special
damages
were
limited
to
pecuniary
harm.
unless
a
plaintiff
could
prove
at
least
some
special
damages,
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
any
recovery
at
all.
if
a
plaintiff
could
prove
some
special
damages,
they
could
recover
not
only
special
damages,
in
other
words
pecuniary
harm,
but
could
also
recover
general
damages,
that
is
damages
for
emotional
distress
or
other
dignitary--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
to
the
extent
i
was
perhaps
disagreeing
with
you
is
i
was
understanding
you
to
say
that
the
definition
of
"special
damages",
the
term
sometimes
includes
emotional
distress
awards.
the
term
"special
damages"
is
limited
to
pecuniary
harm.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
as
the
court
recognized
in
doe,
there
is
a
structural
similarity
between
the
civil
remedies
provision
of
the
privacy
act
and
the
remedial
scheme
for
defamation
per
quod
at
common
law.
and
i
think
one
reason
there
might
be
that
structural
similarity
is
that
defamation
per
quod
at
common
law
solves
the
problem
that
congress
faced
when
it
was
crafting
the
privacy
act,
which
is
trying
to
figure
out
when
a
plaintiff's
injuries
are
sufficiently
serious
and
concrete
as
to
justify
an
award
of
damages.
i
think
it
makes
sense
if,
as
the
court
supposed
in
doe,
congress
were
aware
of
how
defamation
per
quod
had
solved
that
problem,
that
congress
would
have
adopted
the
same
limitation,
in
other
words
the
requirement
of
showing
of
pecuniary
harm,
as
the
threshold
requirement
under
the
privacy
act.
now,
congress
had
very
good
reason
to
be
cautious
about
extending
the
scope
of
liability
under
the
privacy
act.
as
i
said,
the
privacy
act
regulates
a
great
deal
of
conduct
that
wouldn't
have
been
compensable
at
all
in
common
law,
let
alone
resulted
in
any
sort
of
emotional
distress
award.
now,
congress
recognized,
i
think,
some
of
the
concerns
that
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
sotomayor
have
raised
about
why
plaintiffs
might
in
some
instances
deserve
recovery
for
emotional
distress.
but
it
recognized
that
there
are
arguments
on
both
sides,
on
both
sides
on
that
issue.
and
what
it
decided
to
do
in
the
privacy
act
was
to
defer
that
issue
for
later
and
assign
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
to
make
a
recommendation
about
whether
the
scope
of
liability
under
the
act--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
reference
of
the
general
damages
issue
to
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
is
in
the
text
of
the
act
that
congress
enacted
in
1974,
so
the
exclusion
of
general
damages
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
anything
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
said.
as
to
the
weight
we
think
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
report
should
receive,
first
of
all
we
think
it's
very
telling
evidence
that
there
is
at
the
very
least
ambiguity
about
what
the
term
"actual
damages"
could
mean.
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
interpreted
the
term
"actual
damages"
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
we
do
in
our
brief.
that
is,
as
special
damages,
as
that
term
was
understood
in
defamation
torts
at
common
law,
which
the
privacy
protection
commission
study
report
makes
very
clear
at
page
530
is
limited
to
pecuniary
harm.
i
think,
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
that's
a
reasonable
reading,
i
think
the
sort
of
judicial
restraint
that
is
embodied
in
the
canon
that
requires
courts
to
construe
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
narrowly
requires
this
court
to
adopt
that
narrower
reading,
because
it
shows
that
the
narrower
reading
is
at
the
very
least
a
reasonable
one
or,
as
the
court
said
in
nordic
village,
is
a
plausible
one.
i
--
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
unusual
for
congress
silently
or
ambiguously
to
have
decided
to
open
the
door
to
emotional
distress
awards
under
the
privacy
act.
as
i've
said,
the
privacy
act
is
quite
a
broad,
substantive
act
that
would
have
exposed
the
government
to
damages
in
--
in
very
new
ways.
and
i
think
this
case
illustrates
--
illustrates
that.
the
district
court
here
concluded
that
the
law
enforcement-related
disclosure
of
respondent's
medical
information
by
the
social
security
administration
was
in
fact
authorized
under
the
privacy
act
by
a
routine
use
published
in
the
federal
register.
but
it
concluded
that
respondent
could
nevertheless
bring
suit
against
the
federal
government
under
the
privacy
act
because
the
forms
he
filled
out
in
seeking
social
security
disability
benefits
didn't
adequately
disclose
to
him
that
his
information
might
be
released
to
other
government
agencies
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
why
congress
would
necessarily
think
that
an
omission
on
a
government
form
should
give
rise
to
a
claim
for
emotional
distress
damages.
there
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
any
analogue
for
it
at
common
law.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
might
have
a
claim
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
based
on
a
violation
of
some
state
law
statutory
or
common
law
privacy
protection.
so
the
category
of
cases
that
would
have
constituted
invasion
of
privacy
prior
to
the
privacy
act
might
still
be
available
to
a
plaintiff,
who
might
then
recover
emotional
distress
damages
against
the
government.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
they
passed
it,
your
honor,
because
they
wanted,
in
the
wake
of
watergate,
to
impose
a
set
of
detailed
substantive
requirements
about
federal
recordkeeping.
i
think
the
--
you
know,
looking
through
the
act,
which
takes
up
maybe
30
pages
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
clearly
isn't
simply
a
codification
of
common
law
invasion
of
privacy
against
the
federal
government.
it
does
much,
much
more
than
that.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
even
if
we
look
just
at
the
disclosure-related
provision,
it's
broader
than
common
law
invasion
of
privacy
in
two
very
important
ways.
so
for
common
law
invasion
of
privacy,
a
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
disclosure
of
very
personal
and
private
information
to
the
public
at
large.
under
the
privacy
act,
however,
a
disclosure
even
to
a
single
person
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
the
information
doesn't
even
have
to
be
private.
let
me
give
a
concrete
example.
so
if
the
government
has
a
record
that
contains
information
that
someone
has
a
criminal
conviction,
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
privacy
act
for
the
contents
of
that
record
to
be
disclosed,
even
though
someone
could
obtain
the
same
information
by
going
to
the
court
records
or
potentially
looking
them
up
on
the
internet.
and
particularly
since
violations
of
federal
law
are
typically
--
typically,
the
only
type
of
relief
a
plaintiff
can
seek
for
violation
of
federal
law
is
equitable
relief
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
assume
that
congress
ambiguously,
or
i
think
really
silently,
decided
that
it
was
going
to
ratchet
things
up
to
a
serious
degree
and
expose
the
united
states
to
uncapped
emotional
distress
damages
under
the
privacy
act.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
three
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
if
congress
had
thought
that
the
limitation
to
intentional
or
willful
conduct
was
itself
a
sufficient
limitation
on
the
liability
of
the
united
states,
it
wouldn't
have
been
so
reluctant
to
provide
for
general
damages,
or
perhaps
even
for
punitive
damages.
second,
the
courts
of
appeals
now
generally
interpret
the
intentional
or
willful
requirement
to
require
only
something
slightly
less
than
recklessness
or
slightly
more
than
gross
negligence,
which
in
practice
provides
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
with
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
to
find
intentional
or
willful
violations
in
cases
where
the
federal
government
doesn't
believe
it
should
be
liable.
third,
to
the
extent
the
intentional
or
willful
requirement
does
impose
a
limitation
on
a
plaintiff's
recovery,
what
actually
winds
up
happening
in
practice
is
that
plaintiffs
or
courts
will
look
to
all
the
various
technical
provisions
of
the
privacy
act
to
try
to
find
some
violation
that
can
be
classified
as
intentional
or
willful.
so
for
example,
if
a
plaintiff
about
whom
information
has
been
disclosed
can't
show
the
disclosure
is
intentional
or
willful,
he
may
try
to
prove
that
a
violation
of
the
--
of
(e)(10),
which
requires
the
government
to
safeguard
information,
was
intentional
or
willful.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
respondent
would
like
the
court
look
--
would
like
the
court
to
look
to,
quote,
"the
common
and
ordinary
meaning"
of
actual
damages,
and
asserts
that
the
term
"actual
damages"
fits
exactly
here.
but
no
court
to
consider
this
issue
has
ever
thought
that
the
meaning
of
actual
damages
was
plain.
you
have
to
look
at
the
context.
and
the
context
here
includes
the
exclusion
of
general
damages,
which
i
think
respondent
conceded
when
justice
alito
asked
him
this
question
--
includes--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
sources
cited
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
the
sources
cited
in
his
brief
--
in
particular,
i'd
refer
you
to
the
block
quote
on
page
22,
"general
damages",
that
term,
most
typically
refers
to
a
class
or
a
type
of
damages
that
could
be
presumed
but
could
also
be
proven.
and
when
they
are
proven
--
and
i
think
respondent
effectively
conceded
this
--
they
remain
general
damages.
and
because
congress
decided
to
think
about
general
damages
later,
because
that
would
have
been
such
a
great
expansion
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
i
don't
think
the
act
should
be
construed
to
allow
those
type
of
emotional
distress
damages.
now,
respondent
would
like
to--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
essentially
respondent's
argument.
he
wants
to
fault
congress
for
not
using
the
specific
term
"special
damages".
but
i
think
that
flips
the
canon
of
interpreting
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
on
its
head,
and
requires
congress
to
unambiguously
not
waive
its
sovereign
immunity,
when
in
fact,
what
i
think
the
court
does
is
precisely
the
opposite.
i
also
think,
justice
breyer,
addressing
the
privacy
protection
study
commission,
the
commission
included
two
of
the
congressmen
who
sponsored
the
privacy
act.
it
agreed
with
our
reading,
the
reading
that
we
are
offering
here,
of
what
both
actual
damages
mean
and
what
general
damages
mean.
and
--
and
not
only
do
they
agree
with
that,
but
there
is
a
statement
in
the
legislative
history
that
adopts
our
definition,
too,
that's
discussed
in
our
brief.
now,
i
think
what
respondent
essentially
wants
the
court
to
do
here
is
to
adopt
the
recommendation
of
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
that
the
act
be
expanded
to
allow
both
special
and
general
damages,
in
which
case,
emotional
distress
awards
would
be
allowed.
now,
there
may
be
some
good
policy
arguments
for
that,
as
the
privacy
protection
study
commission
said,
but
the
judicial
restraint
that
is
embodied
in
the
sovereign
immunity
canon
i
think
compels
the
court
not
to
get
out
ahead
of
congress
on
this
issue.
congress
didn't
provide
emotional
distress
awards
when
it
passed
the
act
in
1974,
it
never
amended
the
act
to
include
them,
and
the
act
does
not
provide
for
them.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
emotional
distress,
even
physical
symptoms
of
emotional
distress,
are
general
damages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
no
matter
how
they're
proved,
did
you
say?
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they're
general
damages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
first
of
all,
your
honor,
you
can
look
at
page
139
of
the
dobbs
treatise,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
very
clearly
defines
general
damages
in
that
fashion.
also,
if
you
look
at
the
second
restatement,
section
621
and
623,
they
define
general
--
they
define
general
damages
and
emotional
distress
damages
in
this
context
only
by
reference
to
proven
damages.
thank
you.
