stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
tell
me
what
your
response
is
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
privacy
commission
which
was
set
up
understood
the
word
"actual
damages"
at
the
time
the
way
they
understand
it?
what
is
your
response
to
that?
are
they
right
about
that
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
asking
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
am
i
right
in
saying
your
--
you
would
agree
with
them
that
that
is
how
the
privacy
commission
understood
the
act,
but
in
your
opinion,
the
privacy
commission
was
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
by
pain
and
suffering
they
mean
mental
pain
and
suffering?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
would
save
you
some
time,
possibly,
but
my
guess
is
you
may
know
that
every
state
or
many
states
have
statutes
or
tort
laws
or
something
against
invasion
of
privacy.
now,
you
may
know
how
many.
and
--
and
if
you
know
how
many,
that's
helpful.
and
of
those,
if
you
know
how
many,
how
many
of
them,
and
perhaps
all,
provide
damages
for
mental
suffering
caused
by
a
violation
of
that
particular
tort-like
provision?
do
you
know
anything
about
those
statistics?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know
enough
to
know
if
they
have
done
so
through
the
use
of
a
term
like
"actual
damages"
that
run
analogous
thereto,
or
whether
they
had
to
have
some
special
form
of
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
common
law,
if
you
have
a
minute.
suppose
a
plaintiff
proved
that
this
particular
violation
of
privacy
was
so
terrible
he
was
in
bed
for
a
week,
he
couldn't
go
to
his
family's
wedding.
i
mean,
the
absolute
--
the
clearest
possible
proof.
now,
would
that
have
been
considered
general
damages
or
not?
it
wasn't
presumed.
it
wasn't
speculative.
it
wasn't
anything.
it's
absolute
--
tied
up.
would
that
have
been
considered
general
damages,
or
would
it
have
been
considered
special
damages?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
how
well
proved.
no
matter
how
clearly
proved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
how
clearly
they
are
proved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
to
verify
that,
i
look
at
what
definition
where?
