mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
district
courts
do
decide
how
long
a
defendant
should
be
in
prison
for
his
federal
crime,
but
for
many
years,
both
before
and
after
the
sentencing
reform
act,
the
attorney
general
through
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
decided
where
the
sentence
will
be
served
and
when
it
shall
commence.
mr.
william
m.
jay
not
with
a
state
sentence,
your
honor.
before
section
3584(a)
was
passed,
a
federal
district
court
had
no
authority
to
specify
that
its
federal
sentence
should
run
concurrently
with
a
state
sentence
that
the
defendant
was
already
serving.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
that's--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
if
it
had
had
such
authority,
justice
scalia,
it
would
have
overridden
the
attorney
general's
authority.
that's
why
we
know
it
didn't
have
it.
that's
why--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
attorney
general's
authority--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--precisely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
m.
jay
if
you
look
up--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
both
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer.
there
are
cases
that
we
cite
at
page
16
of
our
reply
brief.
those
same
cases,
justice
breyer,
you
may
want
to
look
at
the
senate
report
on
--
on
what
actually
became
section
3584,
page
126
--
sorry,
page
127
and
note
314,
which
says
that
it
changes
the
law.
it
recognized
that
the
law
--
specifically
citing
a
ninth
circuit
decision,
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief,
because
the
attorney
general
has
the
power
to
designate
any
facility,
federal
or
state,
and
that's
--
that
is
carried
forward
today
in
section
3621(b).
because
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
designate
any
such
facility,
a
federal
court
before
the
passage
of
section
3584(a)
had
no
authority
to
order
that
the
federal
sentence
commence
right
away
and
that
the
defendant
be
allowed
to
serve
it
while
also
serving--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
he
could
recommend
it,
just
as
he
can
today.
mr.
william
m.
jay
section
3621(b),
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
subsection
(b)--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
second
sentence,
"the
bureau
may
designate
any
available
penal
or
correctional
facility.
"
--skip
forward
a
little
bit
--
"whether
maintained
by
the
federal
government
or
otherwise--
"
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that
is
how
it
works.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that
is
the
way
it's
being
done,
justice
kennedy.
indeed,
every
time
the
bureau
designates
a
federal
prison
or
a
state
prison,
it's
after
the
person
comes
into
federal
custody,
except
in
cases
where
the
person
voluntarily
surrenders.
mr.
william
m.
jay
privately
run,
state
facilities,
federal
facilities.
mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
federal
inmates
since
the
passage
of
the
first
federal
crime
in
1790
have
served
their
time
in
state
prisons.
there
were
no
federal
penitentiaries
for
more
than
100
years.
the
attorney
--
service
of
a
federal
sentence
in
state
prison
was
the
norm,
even
after
the
construction
of
--
of
federal
penitentiaries.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
justice
alito.
let
me
give
two
reasons
why.
the
first
is
that
before
section
3584
was
enacted,
this
--
the
predecessor
of
this
statute,
which
was
section
4082,
was
the
reason
that
federal
courts
recognized
that
they
didn't
have
the
power
to
prescribe
concurrent
treatment
of
a
federal
sentence
with
a
previously
existing
state
sentence.
that's
one
point.
the
second
point
is,
as
mr.
hawkins
mentioned,
the
quantum
of
federal
punishment,
the
punishment
for
the
federal
offense,
that's
up
to
the
federal
district
judge
to
prescribe;
but
where
--
where
that
time
will
be
served,
and
whether
the
time
has
to
commence
before,
after
or
during
the
defendant's
service
of
another
sentence,
that's
a
where
and
when
question.
and
where
and
when
questions
have
always
been
up
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
m.
jay
yes.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
will
--
i
will
assume
with
you,
justice
kagan,
although
you
know
that
i
disagree,
that
the
--
that
this
is
conscious.
but
two
points:
first,
there
was
no
inherent
authority
beforehand,
so
congress
couldn't
have
been
carrying
forward
existing
practice,
because,
as
i've
said,
there
was
no
inherent
authority
for
district
courts
to
make
this
decision
before.
mr.
william
m.
jay
you
would
do
it
this
way
because
--
because
the
limitations
are
so
clear
and
because,
as
mr.
hawkins
said,
there
is
a
universe
with
sort
of
three
possible
relationships.
either
the
federal
term
comes
before
the
state
term,
after
the
state
term,
or
two
federal
sentences
can
come
at
the
same
time.
so
congress
prescribed
very
carefully
that
if
one
of
those
or
if
the
second
of
those
is
met,
then
the
terms
may
run
concurrently
or
consecutively.
but
by
allowing
the
third,
the
only
other
possibility--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
its
peculiarity,
justice
hagan,
doesn't
take
away
from
the
fact
that
if
you
let
this
situation
in
then
the
limitations
have
no
meaning.
mr.
william
m.
jay
it's
not
a
practical
problem,
justice
breyer,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
mr.
william
m.
jay
number
one
--
number
one,
the
judge
doesn't
know
--
you
asked
us
to
assume
there
has
been
a
conviction
in
the
state,
maybe
just
not--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--maybe
just
not--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--that
just
highlights
my
point.
there
hasn't
been
a
conviction
yet,
let
alone
a
sentence.
there
may
never
be
a
conviction,
and
--
but
if
the
judge
wants
to
guard
against
that
eventuality,
the
judge
can
make
a
recommendation.
and
there
are
two
salutary
things
about
making
a
recommendation--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
don't
think
i
or
either
of
my
friends
who
are
going
to
argue
today
are
suggesting
that
the
federal
judge
has
power
to
order
the
state
court
not
to
do
something.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
the
way
that
sovereigns
work
out
who
gets
to
punish,
if
they
both
want
to
punish--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
you
think
we
are
right,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
but
i
want
to
--
i
do
want
to
give
you
an
answer
to
your
question
about
why
this
is
not
a
practical
problem.
the
federal
judge
can
give
--
can
make
a
recommendation
that
says:
if
he's
convicted
and
if
he's
sentenced
to
a
particular
term
in
the
state
court,
i
recommend
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
not
let
him
serve
them
--
concurrently.
mr.
william
m.
jay
judges
make
recommendations
all
the
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
they--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--as
the
court
is
aware,
the
administrative
office's
standard
form
for
the
judgment
in
a
criminal
case
allows
the
judge
to
make
recommendations
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
so
this
will
be
in
the
judgment,
the
very
judgment
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
be
looking
at,
whether
it's
a
week
later
or
20
years
later.
and
if
the--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--your
honor
is
reading
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
policy
statement.
mr.
william
m.
jay
if
you
go
on
in
that
policy
statement,
it
alludes
to
other
considerations
that
the
bureau
looks
at.
and
what
that
maps
onto
is
the
factors
in
section
3621(b).
and
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
when
--
when
the
--
when
an
inmate
asks
for
concurrent
treatment
in
this
fashion,
the
bureau's
central
facility
for
designation
and
sentence
computation
goes
through
those
factors
in
an
individualized
way
and
makes
--
makes
a
decision.
that
then
is
reviewable.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
federal
or
state
custody,
justice
ginsburg,
it
may
be
a
factor,
yes.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
certainly
correct.
and
on
the
flip
side
is
if
the
defendant
has
behaved
in
an
exemplary
way,
then
either
the
judge
--
the
judge
may
indeed
change
his
recommendation.
we
have
cited
a
case
in
our
brief
where
a
judge--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--mr.
setser
has
been
sentenced
to
151
months
for
his
federal
crime.
nothing
the
attorney
general
does
is
going
to
shorten
that
in
a
way
not
authorized
by
statute.
it
doesn't
make
the
sentence
an
indeterminant
one.
it's
about
where
he
is
going
to
serve
it.
mr.
william
m.
jay
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
the
state
judge
can
still
know
what
the
federal
judge
recommends.
if
it's
not
--
it
just
and
in
won't
be
binding
under
our
view
of
the
statute.
any
event,
having
the
second
decisionmaker
make
the
decision
armed
with
all
the
information
is
still
preferable
to
having
a
premature
determination
locked
in
in
a
judgment.
mr.
william
m.
jay
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
