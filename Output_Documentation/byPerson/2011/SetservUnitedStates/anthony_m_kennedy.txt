justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
say
that
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
there
were
no
multiple
terms
of
imprisonment.
is
that
your
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
what
the
statute
does
is
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
place,
but
it
really
has
consequences
as
to
time.
einstein
would
have
loved
it:
you
can't
define
space
without
time.
[laughter]
but
--
but
--
i
take
it
that
it
can
also
be
retroactive.
if
you
have
a
prisoner
who
has
served
--
has
been
sentenced
in
the
federal
system,
then
goes
to
the
state
and
is
serving
in
a
state
facility,
he
then
comes
back
to
the
bop,
the
bop
can
retroactively
say
we
designate
the
place
of
imprisonment
for
the
last
3
years
as
that
state
prison
where
you
have
been
serving
and
we
credit
you
with
time
served;
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that's
an
amazing
interpretation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that's
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
i
--
i
understand
that
--
that's
the
way
it's
being
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
suppose
in
the
chief's
example
a
super
cautious
state
court
judge
would
say:
i
see
you've
got
a
15-year
sentence
here,
i
don't
know
if
it's
going
to
be
concurrent
or
consecutive;
so
i
will
sentence
you
to
nothing
at
all.
i
mean,
i
suppose
--
which
shows
that
there
--
if
--
if
you
follow
your
rule,
you
may
be
infringing
on
the
federal
balance,
but
then
you
would
say
the
bop
can
do
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
your
position
is
really
more
consistent
with
the
federal
balance
because
it
allows
the
state
to
know
what
it's
deal
with?
