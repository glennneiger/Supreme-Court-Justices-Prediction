justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
the
third
sentence
of
this
provision,
on
its
face,
does
mr.
setser
fit
into
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
"multiple
terms
of
imprisonment
imposed
at
different
times
run
consecutively.
"
what
is
unclear
about
those
words?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
words
are
not
unclear.
we
have
to
do
the
statutory
interpretation
that
you
want?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
fairly
respected
jurists
below,
judge
easterbrook
and
judge
fletcher,
two
different
circuits,
have
read
it
as
taking
care
of
all
those
situations
that
the
other
two
sentences
don't
cover.
why
is
that
an
irrational
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
assumes
the
answer,
is
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
if
you
give
each
sentence
its
plain
meaning,
why
is
--
why
is
mr.
setser
not
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
third?
he
--
he
had
multiple
terms
of
imprisonment,
imposed
at
different
times.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
judicial
review
of
what?
not
of
the
--
not
of
whether
that
was
the
desire
of
the
state
court
or
not.
judicial
review
as
to
whether
they
abused
their
discretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
going
to
make
a
bureaucrat
equal
to
a
judge
in
making
the
most
important
decision
that
a
defendant
faces:
how
much
time
he
should
spend
in
jail.
so
a
bureaucrat
rather
than
a
judge
decides
whether
he's
going
to
tack
on
a
year
and
a
half,
5
or
10,
or
whether
he's
going
to
let
the
defendant
serve
it
concurrently?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
who
or
when,
because
the
state
court
judge's
recommendation
is
not
binding
on
bop.
it
has
said
repeatedly,
hasn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
answer
that
question.
hasn't
bop
said
that
a
state
court
recommendation
is
not
binding
on
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
can't
be
just
who
--
it
can't
be
just
when.
it's
who's
going
to
make
the
decision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
wasn't
the
sra
passed
and
this
provision
passed
in
part
to
take
that
decision
away
from
the
bureaucrat?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
let's
answer
justice
scalia's
point.
wasn't
the
sra
passed
in
part
because
of
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
fact
that
the
parole
board
used
to
make
this
decision,
and
they
wanted
to
put
it
back
in
the
hands
of
judges?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
why
it
takes
away
from
them
on
that
score.
they
can
choose
whatever
facility
they
want
within
the
constraints
imposed
by
a
judge
in
terms
of
the
length
of
the
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
jay--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
jay,
there
is
some
force
to
your,
to
petitioner's
argument
that
federalism
should
be
respected,
that
federal
courts
--
the
state
judges
and
their
individual
wishes
should
be
respected
and
followed
by
bop
actually.
the
system
you're
proposing
actually
takes
away
from
both
federal
judges
control
over
the
sentencing
decision.
if
federal
judges
recommend
a
consecutive
sentence,
then
the
state
judge
can
take
that
into
account
in
setting
how
much
time
they
think
is
warranted
for
their
crime
in
addition
or
different
from,
and
the
judge
if
he
wants
it
to
run
concurrently
the
way
justice
breyer
said,
he
could
just
give
a
zero.
he
knows
what
the
federal
judge
wants.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
bottom
line--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
young
--
it
becomes
easier
than
that.
the
state
court
can't
force
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
to
take
the
prisoner
back,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
and
so
all
it
can
do
is
sentence
the
defendant
to
whatever
time
it's
going
to
sentence
the
defendant.
the
defendant
serves
that
time.
then
the
federal
sovereign
takes
over
and
does
whatever
the
federal
judge
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
runs
it
consecutively
or
concurrently.
whatever
the
federal
judge
said
controls
in
every
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
there
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
question,
whether
this
situation
was
in
any
meaningful
sense
before
the
congress?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
preferable,
to
clog
the
judicial
system
with
untold
number
of
federal
convictions
that
have
not
been
reduced
to
judgment?
that's
preferable
to
giving
judges,
or
recognizing
their
power
to
state
their
views
up
front?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
facts
would
affect
the
sentence
here?
the
judge
here
very
clearly
believed
that
some
of
the
state
charges
overlapped
and
some
didn't.
and
so
it
ran
some
consecutive
to
one
set
of
state
charges
and
concurrent
to
the
other.
what
are
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
defendant
that
the
federal
court
needed
to
know?
