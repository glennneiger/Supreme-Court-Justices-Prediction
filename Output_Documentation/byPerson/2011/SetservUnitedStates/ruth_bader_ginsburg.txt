justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
difference
does
it
make
for
him?
he
served
his
state
time.
he
came
over
to
serve
his
federal
sentence.
he
didn't
get
credit
for
the
2-1/2
years
he
spent
in
--
in
state.
but
what
is
the
consequence?
how
much
--
what
is
the
difference
to
the
defendant
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
entitled
to
credit
or
you
could
seek
it?
i
mean,
what
would
it
--
he
has
the
state
time
and
he
--
2-1/2
years,
and
then
he
has
his
federal
sentence.
why
would
you
be
entitled
to
any
credit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
could
recommend
it.
he
could
recommend
it,
could
he
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jay,
what
does
the
"or"
mean.
maybe
the
judge
--
it
was
20
years
ago
and
maybe
the
judge
said
nothing.
it's
--
what
was
the
intent
of
the
sentencing
court
or
the
goals
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
uh-huh.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
they
take
--
do
they
take
account
of
the
--
the
defendant's
behavior
in
the
state
facility?
is
that
a
factor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
something
that
the
judge
couldn't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
does
to
this
extent.
if
the
two
--
it's
the
second
sentence
that
hasn't
yet
been
imposed,
but
there
is
an
indictment
in
another
federal
court.
if
there's
two
consecutive
prosecutions,
the
first
judge
can't
say,
i
want
my
sentence
to
run
consecutive
to
the
one
that
may
or
may
not
be
imposed
by
another
federal
judge.
that
would
not
be
possible,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
should
--
if
the
order
is
one
way
for
successive
federal
prosecutions,
why
should
it
be
different
when
the
second
prosecution,
instead
of
being
federal,
is
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
the
second
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state
judge
can
decide
what's
going
to
happen
with
the
second
sentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
--
the
argument
about
the
judge
who
anticipates
a
second
sentence
may
be
wrong.
he
doesn't
know
what
that
will
be.
and
when
i
asked,
how
does
the
bureau
make
these
judgments,
does
it
take
into
account
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
in
the
state
facility?
that's
something
that
the
judge
who
sentences
first
can't
possibly
know.
