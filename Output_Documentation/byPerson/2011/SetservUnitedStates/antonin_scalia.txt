justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
isn't
it
true
that
the
bureaucrat
used
to
make
that
decision
not
too
long
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
we
had
the
parole
system.
before
we
had
the
sentencing
guidelines,
it
was
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
whether
to
give
parole
or
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
bureaucrat
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
unthinkable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
clear
on
what
the
--
what
the
government's
view
of
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
inherent
judicial
sentencing
power
is.
you
--
you
--
before
section
3584
was
passed,
there
--
there
was
the
power
on
the
part
of
the
federal
courts
to
decide
whether
sentences
should
run
concurrently
or
sequentially,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
did
not
--
what
authority
it
did
have
did
not
come
from
a
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
the
attorney
general's
authority
prescribed?
justice
antonin
scalia
his
authority
to
say
where
the
sentence
will
be
served?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that
--
that
seems
to
be
quite--
justice
antonin
scalia
--quite
fanciful.
justice
antonin
scalia
nunc
pro
tunc,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
get
that
out
of
this
--
this
lean
language
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
we
tried
to
get
rid
of
all
of
that
when
we
abolished
the
parole
system.
i
thought
we
tried
to
take
away
from
the
bureaucrats
the
decision
to
let
somebody
out
earlier
because
he's
been
a
good
boy
and
hold
him
longer
because
he
hasn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
says
that
the
federal
courts
never
had
that
power
anyway,
so
that
nothing
is
being
restricted.
and
they
contest
the
cases
that
you
have
cited
as
demonstrating
the
existence
of
that
power
in
the
situation
involved
here
to
--
to
determine
whether
a
future
--
a
sentence
to
be
imposed
in
the
future
by
state
courts
will
be
concurrent
or
consecutive
with
the
federal
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
somebody
has
to
make
that
call.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
--
it's
either
the
judge
or
the
jailer.
there's
nobody
who
else
is
going
to
make
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
say
the
judge
can't,
it's
going
to
be
the
bureau
of
prisons.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
--
am
i
correct,
mr.
young,
that
if
--
if
the
federal
sentencing
judge
is
erroneous
in
his
prediction
of
what
the
state
court
later
sentencing
will
do,
that
his
order,
based
upon
that
erroneous
prediction,
can
be
altered
upon
appeal
by
the
bureau
of
prisons?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
when
officers
of
the
lubbock
texas
police
department
arrested
monroe
setser,
the
petitioner
here,
on
a
drug
offense,
he
was
already
serving
a
five-year
term
of
probation
imposed
by
a
texas
court
for
a
previous
drug
offense.
he
was
indicted
in
state
court
on
the
new
drug
charges
and
the
state
also
moved
to
revoke
his
probationary
term.
about
the
same
time,
setser
pleaded
guilty
to
federal
drug
charges
arising
out
of
the
same
acts.
the
federal
district
court
sentenced
him
first.
it
imposed
a
151-month
sentence
and
ordered
that
it
should
run
consecutively
to
any
state
sentence
imposed
for
the
probation
violation
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
acts
that
the
federal
sentence
was
being
imposed
for,
but
would
be
served
concurrently
with
any
state
sentence
imposed
on
a
new
drug
charge
which
did
overlap
the
--
the
federal
one.
while
setser's
federal
appeal
was
pending,
the
state
court
sentenced
him
to
five
years
for
the
probation
violation
and
10
years
for
the
new
drug
charge
but
ordered
that
both
of
those
sentences
would
be
served
concurrently.
before
the
fifth
circuit,
setser
made
the
same
two
arguments
that
he
made
--
makes
before
us
here.
first,
he
argues
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
order
that
his
federal
sentence
should
run
consecutively
to
a
state
sentence
that
had
not
yet
been
imposed.
the
sentencing
reform
act,
he
claimed,
deprived
district
courts
of
that
authority.
second,
he
claimed
that
his
sentence
was
unreasonable
and
therefore
unlawful
because
you
cannot
serve
a
--
its
really
quite
impossible,
you
cannot
serve
a
federal
sentence
both
consecutively
to
one
state
sentence
and
concurrently
to
another
state
sentence
when
both
of
those
sentences
are
being
served
concurrently.
just
think
about
that.
[laughter]
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
both
arguments
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
setser
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
the
united
states
supported
his
petition,
agreeing
with
his
argument
that
the
district
court
had
no
such
anticipatory
sentencing
authority.
since
both
parties
rejected
the
fifth
circuit's
view,
we
appointed
an
amicus
curiae
to
defend
the
judgment
below
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
it
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
to
be
clear
about
what's
at
issue.
setser
acknowledges
that
his
federal
sentence
may
run
either
consecutively
to
or
concurrently
with
his
state
sentence.
that
is,
he
has
no
legal
right
to
get
credit
for
his
time
served
in
state
prison
and
he
acknowledges
that
someone
in
the
federal
government
must
decide
whether
he
will
get
that
credit,
so
the
question
here
is
who
will
decide.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
judge
may
decide.
judges
have
traditionally
had
broad
discretion
in
selecting
whether
the
sentences
they
impose
will
run
concurrently
or
consecutively
or
--
and
that
--
not
only
concurrently
or
consecutively
the
sentences
imposed
in
federal
court,
but
also
concurrently
or
consecutively
the
sentences
that
have
already
been
imposed
in
state
proceedings.
and
of
the
lower
courts
who
addressed
this
issue
before
the
passing
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
most
held
that
the
court’s
discretion
included
the
authority
to
--
in
order
that
a
federal
sentence
should
--
should
be
serve
consecutively
to
an
anticipated
state
sentence.
setser
and
the
government
assert,
however,
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
denies
district
courts
this
authority
and
that
the
decision
belongs
instead
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
the
executive
branch
which
is
what
the
government
argues.
we
side
with
the
judges.
the
portion
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
on
which
setser
relies,
section
3584
of
title
18
does
not
take
away
judge's
inherent
sentencing
discretion.
it
says,
if
multiple
terms
of
imprisonment
are
imposed
on
a
defendant
at
the
same
time,
that's
not
what
happened
here,
or
if
a
term
of
imprisonment
is
imposed
on
a
defendant
who
is
already
subject
to
an
undischarged
term
of
imprisonment,
again
that's
not
this
case,
the
terms
may
run
concurrently
or
consecutively.
setser
and
the
government
invoke
the
latin
maxim
as
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius
to
express
one
thing
is
to
exclude
the
other
which
is
latin
for
what
we
call
in
english,
a
negative
inference.
so
they
say,
because
the
act
contemplates
judicial
discretion
in
case
a
and
case
b,
judges
do
not
have
discretion
in
case
c,
but
the
negative
inference
is
just
that,
an
inference
and
in
this
case,
it
is
in
our
view
overcome
by
a
much
stronger
inference
based
on
the
same
latin
maxim.
setser
and
the
government
say
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
derives
the
authority
to
determine
whether
his
federal
sentence
will
be
served
consecutively
or
concurrently,
derives
that
authority
from
another
portion
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
section
3621(b),
but
that
provision
says
absolutely
nothing
about
sentencing
authority.
it
reads,
the
bureau
of
prisons
shall
designate
the
place
of
the
prisoner's
imprisonment.
the
bureau
may
designate
any
available
penal
or
correctional
facility
that
meets
minimum
standards
of
health
and
habitability
established
by
the
bureau,
whether
maintained
by
the
federal
government
or
otherwise.
it
then
goes
--
goes
on
to
list
the
factors
the
bureau
must
consider
in
making
its
--
its
designation,
including
“the
resources
of
the
facility
contemplated”.
if
congress
meant
to
give
the
bureau
the
same
sentencing
authority
in
case
c,
that
it
acknowledge
judges
to
have
in
cases
a
and
b,
you
would
expect
section
3621(b)
to
say
something,
anything
about
consecutive
or
concurrent
sentences,
but
it
doesn't,
so
as
we
say,
expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius.
it
is
true
[laughter]
it
is
true
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
making
this
determination
after
the
prisoner
has
already
served
his
state
sentence
would
have
more
information
before
it
that
would
be
useful
in
making
this
consecutive
versus
concurrent
determination,
but
in
this
case,
the
interest
in
fully
informed
decision
making
is
overcome
by
the
text
of
the
act,
by
our
tradition
of
judicial
sentencing
and
by
the
countervailing
interest
that
sentencing
should
not
be
left
to
the
employees
of
the
same
department
of
justice
that
conducts
the
prosecution.
finally,
we
also
reject
the
independent
argument
that
even
if
the
district
court
had
authority
to
make
its
sentence
concurrent
or
consecutive
to
a
yet
to
be
imposed
state
sentence,
the
sentenced
imposed
here
was
unreasonable
and
hence
an
abuse
of
discretion
because
it
cannot
possibly
be
consecutive
to
one
state
sentence
and
concurrent
with
the
other.
that
difficulty,
however,
arises
not
from
the
federal
court
sentence
but
from
the
later
event
of
the
state
court's
decision
and
the
fact
that
a
sentence
turns
out
to
be
impracticable
because
of
later
events
does
not
render
it
unreasonable
when
imposed.
if
for
example,
the
court
imposes
a
sentence
of
supervised
release,
conditioned
upon
gainful
employment,
the
sentence
is
not
retroactively
rendered
unreasonable
when
the
defendant
incurs
a
disability
that
makes
gainful
employment
impossible.
deciding
how
to
sort
things
out
in
such
a
situation,
and
the
situation
here
is
really
a
fluke,
maybe
difficult,
but
it
does
not
show
that
the
district
court
sentence
was
unlawful
at
the
time
it
was
imposed.
setser
identifies
no
flaw
in
the
district
court's
decision
making
process
nor
anything
available
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
the
court
failed
to
consider.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy
and
ginsburg
join.
