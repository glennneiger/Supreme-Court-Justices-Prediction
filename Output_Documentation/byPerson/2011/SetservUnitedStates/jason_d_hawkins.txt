mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether,
in
passing
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984,
congress
granted
to
the
federal
district
court
the
authority
to
order
its
federal
sentence
to
run
consecutively
to
a
--
a
sentence
which
has
yet
to
be
imposed
and
may
never
come
to
fruition.
the
text
of
3584,
its
structure
and
its
history
all
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
lacks
this
power.
we
believe
the
question
should
start
and
end
with
the
statute's
text.
when
a
defendant
receives
multiple
terms
of
imprisonment,
they
must
bear
one
of
three
relationships
to
each
other.
either
one
is
imposed
before
the
other,
the
other
is
imposed
before
the
one,
or
they
are
imposed
at
the
same
time.
in--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--no,
your
honor.
he
does
not.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
that
term
can
only--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--your
--
your
honor,
the
words
can
only
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
first
--
of
the
first
sentence.
we
believe
that
the
third
sentence
only
applies
where
the
court
had
the
authority
to
actually
order
this
but
remained
silent.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
it
has
to
be
read
--
the
third
sentence
has
to
be
read
in
its
place
within
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
the
third
sentence
refers
exclusively
to
circumstances
where
the
defendant
was
already
serving
another
term
of
imprisonment
at
the
time
of
the
federal
sentencing.
i
think
we
know
this
because
of
the
parallel
structure
of
3584(a).
it--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--yes,
but
those
terms
of
imprisonment
weren't
--
there
was
no
term
of
imprisonment
imposed
at
the
time
of
his
federal
sentencing.
he
was
not
serving
an
undischarged
term
of
imprisonment.
and
we
believe
that
the
natural
flow
of
the
statute,
the
default
rule
only
comes
in
place
if
the
court
had
the
power
to
sentence
under
the
first
sentence.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
federal
sentencing,
mr.
--
mr.
setser
was
not
subject
to
an
undischarged
term
of
imprisonment.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
we
--
we
believe
that
the
order,
what
the
order
did
was
bind
the
court.
i'm
sorry,
the
--
the
order
bound
the
bureau
of
prisons.
and
so
what
it
does
--
what
happens
is,
mr.
setser
is
not
able
to
petition
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
allow
that
sentence
to
begin
running
from
the
time
of
the
federal
sentencing.
so
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
1
year,
6
months,
and
23
days
that
we
believe
that
he
is
entitled
to
credit
for.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
because
--
because,
your
honor,
the
court
ordered
that
the
--
the
federal
sentence
to
run
concurrently
to
that
10-year
sentence
that
he
received
in
state
court.
and
so
we
believe
he
is
entitled
to
credit
for
that
--
for
that
sentence.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
in
our
estimation
the
question
is
not
the
who,
but
the
when.
and
at
the
time,
at
the
federal
sentencing,
the
federal
judge
did
not
have
the
complete
information
to
make
the
proper
judgment
in
this
case.
he
had
no
idea
what
that
state
term
of
imprisonment
was
going
to
be.
so
in
our
estimation,
it
is
better
that
--
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
all
the
information
to
make
this
decision.
it
will
actually
know
what
the
state
term
of
imprisonment
is.
i'm
not
here
to
advocate
that
the
system
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
uses
--
uses
is
perfect--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
the
federal
judge
passed
this
sentence,
he
had
no
idea
what
was
going
to
happen
in
either
case.
but
more
importantly,
with
regard
to
the
term
of
probation,
the
federal
judge
had
no
idea
whether
that
term
was
going
to
be
revoked,
whether
it
would
be
modified,
or
whether
he
would
receive
any
sentence
of
--
of
imprisonment
at
all.
and
in
making
the
judgment
on
whether
those
terms
should
run
concurrently
or
consecutively,
your
honor,
3584(b)
directs
the
court
to
look
at
the
factors
of
3553(a)
in
making
that
determination.
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
that
determination
under
3553(a)
whether
the
sentence
is
adequate
to
deter,
whether
that
sentence
protects
the
public,
without
knowing
what
that
state
term
of--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--imprisonment
actually
is.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
the
--
the
bureau
of
--
of
prisons
is
bound
by
the
factors
of
3621(b),
and
several
of
those
factors
match
up
with
the
factors
in
3553(a).
it
has
to
look
at
the
nature
and
circumstance
of
the
crime,
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
it
has
to
look
to
the
united
states
sentencing
guidelines,
and
it
also
has
to
take
in
the
view
of
what
the
federal
judge
believes
should
have
happened.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
and
to
the
extent--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
in
--
in
the
solicitor
general's
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
--
the
law
requires
is
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
to
look
at
these
factors
under
3621(b),
and
those
program
statements
are
trying
to
define
what
those
exact
factors
are.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
to
--
to
be
clear,
i
mean,
mr.
setser
is
going
to
have
to
serve
a
151-month
term
of
imprisonment
no
matter
what.
but
the
bureaucrat
that
--
that
you
are
talking
about,
the
bureaucrat
will
be
--
only
be
making
that
determination
after
having
the
complete
information
which
the
federal
judge--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
but
still,
that
--
that
person
has
the
--
has
the
information
before
it,
and
it's
also
subject
to
judicial
review
under
2241.
i
--
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
a
process
where
the
petitioner
can
--
or
the
prisoner
can
ask
for
this--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that's
--
that's
the
same
discretion
that
the
court
has
when
its
deciding
a
sentence
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
again,
it
--
it's
not
the
who
for
us,
but
the
when.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
your
honor,
i'm
aware
of
no--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that
--
what
that
--
i
mean--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
bureaucrat
at
least
has
all
the
information
before
it.
and
if
we
go
to--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor,
along
with
good
time
credits--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--no,
your
honor,
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
sra,
the--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--well,
it
was
a
--
it
was
passed
to
take
the
decision
away
from
the
bureaucrat,
that
the
courts
could
not
order
a
federal
sentence
to
run
concurrently
with
an
undischarged
state
term
of
imprisonment.
that
gave
that
power
back
to
the
court.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
that's
part
of
the
reason,
your
honor.
but
in
passage
of
3621
it
also
highlighted
the
fact
that
it
was
not
seeking
to
take
away
the
bureaucratic
authority
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
for
designation.
and
back
to
the--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--well,
i
mean
--
i
guess,
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
part
of
it,
but
that
only
comes
into
play
when
the
first
sentence
does
not
apply
and
when
the
court
does
not
have
the
requisite
information.
in
our
estimation
it
is
better
for
the
latter
sentencing
entity,
that
with
the
most
sentencing
information,
to
be
able
to
make
this
--
this
ultimate
determination
in
--
in
looking
at
the
federal
court's
views,
versus
allowing
a
federal
judge
who's
prognosticating
about
what
the
sentence
might
be
and
issue
a
binding
order.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
rebuttal
time.
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
thank
you.
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
go
back
to
your
hypothetical,
i
think
that
the
way
that
the
federal
judge
can
get
this
accomplished
is
simply
by
waiting.
after
--
after
the
conviction,
your
honor,
they
can
send
the
state
prisoner
back
down
to
state
court,
allow
for
that
state
sentence
to
be
imposed,
and
then
he
can
come
back
into
federal
custody.
and
in
that
situation,
that
is
when
the
court
has
the
authority
to
issue
this
binding
order.
that
is
the
--
because
it
has
all
of
the
information.
and
--
and
i
would
also--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--your
honor,
the
judge
can
state
the
views
--
her
views
up
front
in
a
recommendation.
it
cannot
do
so
if
it
doesn't
know
all
the
facts.
it
cannot--
mr.
jason
d.
hawkins
--your
honor,
i
think
in
looking
at
3584,
it
may
well
seem
reasonable
for
the
federal
court
to
have
done
this,
but
the
--
the
fact
is,
is
that
congress
drew
a
bright
line,
and
it
has
to
be
subject
to
this
undischarged
term
of
imprisonment.
