justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
situations
like
this,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
make
the
decision
whether
the
federal
sentence
and
the
subsequently
imposed
state
sentence
run
concurrently
or
consecutively.
and
now
you're
arguing
that
that
should
be
done
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
do
you
think
in
general
that
is
better
for
defendants
than
a
rule
that
would
allow
the
sentencing
judge
in
federal
court
to
make
that
determination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
the
--
why
would
the
exact
length
of
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
state
court
be
relevant
to
the
determination
made
by
the
sentencing
judge?
i
thought
the
sentencing
judge's
reasoning
was
that
the
--
the
undischarged
term
of
imprisonment
that
was
going
to
be
imposed
on
the
offense
for
which
probation
had
previously
been
granted
and
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
probation,
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
subsequent
federal
drug
charges,
and
therefore
the
federal
drug
charges
should
run
consecutively
to
that,
but
should
be
concurrent
to
any
sentence
imposed
by
the
state
court
on
the
state
drug
charges.
what
--
you
know,
what's
wrong
with
that
reasoning,
and
what
additional
insight
relevant
to
that
reasoning
would
be
obtained
by
waiting
until
after
the
sentence
was
imposed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
interesting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
bound
by
those
factors
when
they
make
the
decision
later?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
how
long
someone
should
spend
in
prison,
which
is
what's
involved
in
determining
whether
--
deciding
whether
a
sentence
is
going
to
be
served
consecutively
or
concurrently,
is
very
different
from
determining
where
the
sentence
is
going
to
be
--
where
a
sentence
is
going
to
be
served.
isn't
this
a
very
strange
reading
of
--
of
3621,
to
say
that
that
grants
the
bop
the
authority
to
make
this
concurrent/consecutive
determination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
perhaps
something
that
i
should
have
asked
the
solicitor
general,
but
do
you
have
any
idea
how
often
this
situation
comes
up?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
i
think
we
--
is
it
correct,
we
would
have
to
determine
that
there
was
this
authority
inherent
in
the
judiciary
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
with
respect
to
federal
sentences,
certainly
that
is
true.
but
with
respect
to
federal
and
state
sentences
it
may
be,
as
you
suggested
it,
this
just
did
not
come
up
very
often
until
the
enactment
probably
of
the
federal
drug
laws
and
--
and
a
few
other
statutes
that
created
offenses
where
you
have
--
where
the
same
conduct
would
constitute
a
violation
of
both
federal
and
state
law,
and
so
you
have
this
situation
coming
up
with
greater
frequency.
