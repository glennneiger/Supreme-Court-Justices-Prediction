chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-7387,
setser
v.
united
states.
mr.
hawkins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
all
that
that
you
just
read,
that
they're
bound
by
all
these
things?
where
do
i
find
that?
3621(b),
is
it
cited
in
any
of
your
briefs?
or
pardon
me.
is
3621(b)
set
forth
in
any
of
the
materials?
i
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
i
--
is
it
in
the
government's
brief
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i'm
looking
at
--
i
guess
i
got
this
off
--
somebody
got
this
off-line
for
me.
i
am
looking
at
the
program
statement
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
and
it
says
what
the
regional
directors
are
supposed
to
look
at
is
the
intent
of
the
federal
sentencing
court
or
the
goals
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
so
you've
got
some
guy
deciding
whether
the
goals
of
the
criminal
justice
system
require
this
person
to
serve
an
extra
10
years
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
doesn't
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
a
federal
bureaucrat
sitting,
a
regional
director
--
i
guess
there
are
about
a
half
dozen
of
them
--
sits
somewhere
and
decides
whether
a
defendant
--
say
there's
a
10-year
federal
sentence,
10-year
state
sentence,
and
that
person
says,
well,
i
think
he
ought
to
serve
another
10
years
or
i
think
he's
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
--
but
it's
a
big
deal
to
be
sentenced
to,
in
my
hypothetical,
another
10
years
in
prison.
i
don't
care
how
much
information
the
bureaucrat
has.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
federal
or
state.
where
does
it
say
that
in
3621?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
--
or
what
if
it's
a
situation
where
he
goes
into
one
of
these
prisons
that
are
run
by
a
private
entity,
right,
whether
the
federal
government
or
otherwise,
right?
and
so
maybe
the
federal
government
--
i
don't
know
how
often
it
might
do
it
--
they
--
you
use
facilities
that
are
privately
run,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
why
isn't
that
what
they
meant
when
they
said
"whether
maintained
by
the
federal
government
or
otherwise?
"
i
think
if
they
want
--
wanted
to
say
state
or
federal,
that's
what
they
would
have
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
--
so
that
20
years
later
after
the
defendant
has
served
his
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
your
friend
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
regional
office
is
supposed
to
go
look
back
and
see
what
the
judge
said
20
years
ago?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
is
responsive
to
the
point
i
just
made,
that
they
make
recommendations
all
the
time.
i'm
talking
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
recommendation
20
years
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
may
answer
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
young.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
interested
in
pursuing
the
point
justice
breyer
raised.
i
am
troubled
by
the
idea
that
someone
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
makes
this
determination,
but
i
--
i
wonder
how
that
--
how
that
helps
you.
you
said
it's
either
the
jailer
or
the
judge,
and
therefore,
you
do
have
to
decide
it.
but
maybe
it's
either
the
first
judge
or
the
second
judge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
--
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
say
that
the
federal
court
doesn't
--
whoever
is
second
can
always
tailor
their
sentence
to
what
they
want.
whoever
is
first
just
has
to
give
the
sentence
that
he
or
she
thinks
is
appropriate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
compel
--
no,
doesn't
compel
the
federal
sovereign.
he
would
say:
look,
i
want
to
give
10
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
see
you
have
already
got,
you
know,
a
--
a
15-year
sentence
under
the
federal,
but
i
don't
want
it
to
be
25
years;
so
i'm
going
to,
in
fact,
just
give
you
a
5-year
sentence.
do
understand
what
i'm
making?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whoever
the
second
judge
is
can
figure
out
exactly
how
long
he
thinks
the
sentence
should
run,
and
give
the
sentence
accordingly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
can't
--
he
can't
--
if,
for
example,
they
are
dealing
with
a
mandatory
minimum.
if
the
state
court
judge
has
to
sentence
the
person
to
10
years,
then
your
explanation
falls
apart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hawkins,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
in
case
10-7387,
setser
versus
united
states.
