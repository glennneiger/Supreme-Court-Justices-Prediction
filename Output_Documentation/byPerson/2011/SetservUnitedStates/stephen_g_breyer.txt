justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--really
interesting,
because
i
did
go
back
and
look
at
the
'79
senate
report
on
the
s.
1,
which
was
the
whole
reform,
from
beginning
to
end,
and
my
reading
of
that
section
suggests
to
me
that
they
thought
past
practice
was
exactly
what
they
wrote
in
this
statute.
now
in
the
--
at
least
that's
how
i
read
it.
maybe
i
didn't
read
it
carefully
enough.
but
i
thought
they
were
thinking
that
the
federal
judge
does
have
the
power
to
sentence
concurrently
or
consecutively
with
a
term
that
a
federal
court
or
a
state
court
has
imposed
in
the
past,
but
--
but
you
can't
do
this
monkey
business
that
they're
--
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
there
was
nothing
about
trying
to
make
something
concurrent
or
consecutive
with
a
--
a
state
term
that
hasn't
yet
been
imposed.
you
couldn't
do
it;
you
can't
do
it;
it
just
gets
into
a
--
at
least
not
with
a
consecutive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
talking
linguistically
that
i
thought
one
congress
probably
did
have
it
in
mind.
i
agree
with
you
about
that.
but
leave
that
out.
how
do
you
do
it?
you
are
a
federal
judge.
the
point
of
the
federal
guideline
is
to
create
a
sentence
with
qualifications
that
reflects
the
real
conduct
in
the
world
that
the
defendant
engaged
in.
all
right,
so
we
work
that
out.
that's
now
3
years.
now,
our
problem
is
that
the
state
judge
may
eat
up
some
of
that
3
years
or
may
make
the
sentence
concurrent
when
it
should
be
consecutive,
because
the
conduct's
different.
so
i
the
federal
judge
say:
you
are
convicted
of
a
drug
crime;
you
get
3
years.
i
know
there
is
a
question
here
about
whether
there
is
a
separate
gun
crime.
that's
state.
now,
i
want
these
3
years
to
run
consecutive
with
the
state
conviction
for
a
separate
behavior.
okay?
now,
that's
what
i
want.
now,
are
it's
in
the
past,
the
state
sentence,
i
can
do
it.
but
where
it
hasn't
been
happening
yet,
how
do
i
do
it?
i
say
i
want
it
consecutive,
but
the
state
court
judge
who
later
will
have
control
of
the
case
can
say:
i
put
my
extra
2
years
and
make
it
concurrent
with
the
state
sentence.
"you
see?
"
"it's
a
problem.
"
"it's
a
practical
problem.
"
"now,
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
what
i've
just
said,
which
is
why
i
said
it,
because
i'm
prepared
to
have
you
tell
me
i'm
wrong,
there
is
no
practical
problem.
"
"but
i
want
to
hear
it.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
good.
that's
why
i
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
has
not
been
a
conviction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
the
judge
stop
the
state
court
judge
later
from
making
his
conviction
for
a
separate
form
of
behavior
run
concurrently
with
the
federal
sentence?
how
does
he
stop
that?
what
power
does
he
have
over
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
then
how
can
he
stop
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
may
have
missed
my
point.
my
point
is
because
he
can't
stop
it
is
why
you're
right
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
nobody
found
that
out
in
1980,
in
1980
or
'79.
if
you
look
through
the
senate
report
on
that,
they
don't
refer
to
any
of
those
cases.
they
write
it
as
if
it
was
just
as
justice
scalia
and
the
government
said.
and
honestly,
my
question
really
is
the
same
one
--
maybe
i
didn't
put
it
clearly,
but
i
think
you
understood
it
--
that
the
reason
they
want
the
federal
judge
to
be
able
to
shape
his
sentence
in
light
of
other
sentences
that
either
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts
have
given
in
the
past
is
because
you
can
do
it
so
that
a
single
behavior
gets
a
single
sentence
and
a
different
behavior
is
going
to
be
sentenced
consecutively,
presumptively.
but
you
just
can't
do
that
where
the
state
court
hasn't
yet
acted,
because
--
at
least
you
can't
do
it
in
the
consecutive
case,
because
the
state
court
judge
sees
what
you
did
and
he
may
decide:
i
don't
want
it
to
be
conservative.
so
here
i
am;
i'm
writing
my
sentence
to
be
served
concurrently
with
the
federal
court
sentence.
now,
you
can
have
every
agency
you
want
in
the
federal
government.
but
there's
no
way
to
get
around
that.
you
can't
force
that
state
judge
to
do
something
different
and
you
can't
muck
around
with
your
federal
sentence
in
a
way
that
will
make
it
consecutive
to
a
state
court
sentence
that
says
it's
going
to
run
concurrent.
so
there
is
a
practical
problem
and
that's
why
it's
left
out.
it's
quite
--
i
mean,
when
i
finished
reading
it
i
thought
this
is
very
logical.
can
you
tell
me
what
the
answer
to
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
deny
that
there
are
many
instances
where
you
could
get
it
to
work,
particularly
where
you
are
going
concurrent.
i
do
deny
that
there
is
--
it's
all
smooth
sailing.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
you
can't
get
it
to
work.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself
again.
i've
given
you
the
example,
i
gave
him
the
example,
and
i
want
to
know
how
you
would
overcome
that
could
be
quite
common
situation
where
the
state
judge
hasn't
done
it
yet,
so
there's
no
way
to
require
the
federal
court
sentence
to
be
served
consecutively,
if
the
state
judge
decides
it
shouldn't
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
know.
i
don't
deny
there
can
be
some.
i
say
there
is
a
concern
that
if
he
were
to
say
in
a
different
case,
i
want
the
gun
thing
which
is
going
to
state
court
to
be
consecutive,
that
you
can't
control
that.
because
the
state
court
judge
could
say:
i
want
my
gun
sentence,
state,
to
run
concurrently
with
federal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
now
we
are
getting
awfully
complicated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'd
be
a
little
worried
in
this
case
at
deciding
whether
section,
what
is
that
section,
the
place
of
imprisonment,
section
3621(b)
whether
that
does
or
does
not
give
the
power
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
the
power
that
they've
assumed
for
many,
many
years.
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question
here?
i
didn't
realize
i
was
deciding
that.
i
thought
i
was
just
deciding
whether
--
whether
the
judge,
the
sentencing
judge,
has
the
power
to
impose
say
a
consecutive
sentence,
say
my
sentence
will
run
consecutively
to
a
state
court
sentence
that
has
not
yet
been
imposed.
i
thought
that
was
all
i
had
to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
i
mean,
maybe
we
do
have
to
get
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
then:
is
it
--
is
it
--
if
we
want
the
judge
to
be
able
to
say
this
particular
prisoner
will
serve
his
federal
sentence
after
the
state
gun
sentence
is
served
or
alternatively
with
the
state
gun
sentence,
the
3621
says
that
--
that
the
judge
can,
if
that
sentence,
state
sentence
has
not
yet
been
imposed,
we
don't
know
what
it
is,
we
don't
know
if
it
will
be
imposed,
we
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
say,
we
don't
know
whether
they
are
going
to
sentence
him
to
be
--
count
his
time,
time
served
in
the
federal
judge.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
say
in
federal
prison.
but
he
can
write
down
what
he
wants
as
far
as
any
statement
by
the
court
that
imposed
the
sentence,
a
statement
concerning
the
purposes
for
which
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
has
been
imposed.
he
would
say:
i'm
trying
to
get
a
single
behavior
punished
once
for
4
years
and
then
that
separate
behavior
i
would
like
punished
by
2
years
more.
okay?
so
you
write
it
down
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
follows
it.
and
if
they
don't
follow
it,
they
could
get
reversed
by
a
district
court,
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
will
that
solve
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
isn't
a
tie.
i
mean,
there
is
one
thing
on
each
side.
on
your
side
is
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
judge,
federal,
is
trying
to
figure
out
his
own
sentence
and
he
does
--
either
he
does
want
or
he
doesn't
want
that
particular
individual
to
serve
additional
time,
should
a
state
court
judge
later
decide
on
some
related
or
unrelated
matter,
all
right?
and
if
that
were
all
that
was
at
issue,
and
the
choice
is
between
his
saying
just
doing
it,
writing
it
in
the
sentence,
or
he's
writing
down
his
reasons
what
he'd
like
to
have
happen
in
letting
the
bureau
implement
that
as
best
they
can
under
the
section
we
are
talking
about.
that's
on
the
one
side.
and
that
says
let
the
judge
do
it,
don't
give
the
implementation.
on
the
other
side
is
to
let
the
judge
do
it
risks
complex
interference
with
the
second
to
sentence,
who
is
the
state
court
judge.
it
may
be
you're
right,
that
there's
some
way
of
working
it
out,
but
it
sounds
complicated
to
me,
particularly
in
--
in
the
consecutive
case.
so
we
have
federalism
principles
on
one
hand,
versus
the
judge,
versus
the
bureaucracy
on
the
other.
and
so
it
isn't
so
easy.
that's
--
that's
why
i
think
this
is
not
such
an
easy
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
the
state
court
judge
that
wants
to
sentence
a
person
to
an
unrelated
offense--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
he
wants
--
he
decides
he
wants
it
to
run
consecutive
--
concurrently
with
the
federal
--
ongoing
federal
sentence.
there
is
no
way
to
stop
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
then
you
--
but
you
can't
break
this
thing
down.
either
they
have
the
power
in
the
federal
district
court
under
this
particular
provision,
with
all
its
presumptions,
to
run
this
mechanism,
the
one
that's
in
the
statute,
in
respect
to
state
court
sentences
that
have
not
yet
been
imposed
or
they
do
not
have
that
power.
we
can't
break
it
down
and
say
sometimes
you
have
it,
and
sometimes
you
don't.
