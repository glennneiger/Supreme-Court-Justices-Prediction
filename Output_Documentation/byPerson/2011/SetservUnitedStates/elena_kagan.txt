mr.
jay?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
--
can
i
take
you
back
to
3584?
so
3584
talks
about
these
two
situations,
simultaneously
imposed
terms
and
undischarged
terms,
and
let's
assume
that
all
three
sentences
talk
about
only
those
two
situations.
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
in
talking
about
those
two
situations
congress
rejected
judicial
authority
when
it
came
to
a
third
situation.
and
i
guess
i
want
to
find
out
from
you
why
that
is.
i
mean,
i
want
to
stipulate,
i
guess,
that
nobody
had
this
third
situation
in
mind.
the
third
situation
is
a
very
uncommon
situation,
and
so
just
assume
with
me
that
congress
simply
just
wasn't
thinking
about
this
third
situation.
that's
an
assumption
of
the
question.
what
should
we
do,
then?
why
would
we
treat
this
as
exclusive?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
let's
just
say
congress
just
didn't
know.
it
was
not
on
congress's
radar
screen.
why
would
we
treat
this
as
exclusive
as
to
this
third
situation?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
now
you
are
back
with
my
assumption.
you
are
suggesting
that
congress
musthave
had
this
third
situation
in
mind.
and
i'm
saying
no;
the
third
situation
is
peculiar,
and
congress
didn't
have
it
in
mind.
then
what?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
young,
the
government
says
that
there
are
three
situations
in
which
this
consecutive-concurrent
problem
comes
up.
this
statute
deals
with
two
of
them.
and
the
government
wants
to
--
argues
that
in
dealing
with
two
of
them
it
impliedly
stated
a
rule
on
the
third.
what's
the
best
argument
--
what's
your
best
argument
against
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that's
not
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
sentence
of
this
statute
grants
authority
to
the
courts
in
these
two
situations.
and
the
second
and
third
say
what
happens
when
that
authority
isn't
exercised.
the
question
i'm
struggling
with
--
and
it's
the
same
question
i
put
to
mr.
jay
--
is
why
we
should
think
that
the
grant
of
authority
over
situation
a
and
situation
b
is
a
denial
of
authority
over
situation
c.
so
what's
your
best
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
but
if
one
had
--
you
know,
what
i
take
as
the
view
of
justice
alito's
question
is
that
there
was
no
--
no
practice
supporting
courts
sentencing
in
this
way.
it
--
it
just
wasn't
done.
mostly,
it
wasn't
on
anybody's
radar
screen
that
this
was
a
significant
issue.
what
would
we
do
then,
if
we
thought
congress
didn't
speak
to
it,
but
we
also
didn't
see
a
past
practice
inconsistent
with
what
the
government
is
suggesting?
