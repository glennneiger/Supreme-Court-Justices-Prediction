mr.
evan
a.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
stated
nearly
a
century
ago
in
ex
parte
united
states,
under
our
constitutional
system
the
right
to
impose
the
punishment
provided
by
law
is
judicial.
congress
does
not
transfer
such
core
authority
from
one
branch
to
another
without
clearly
and
expressly
saying
so.
neither
section
3584
nor
any
other
provision
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
even
remotely
approaches
the
clarity
that
congress
would
use
if
it
intended
to
restrict
judicial
sentencing
in
cases
like
setser's.
mr.
evan
a.
young
against
--
that
is
wrong,
because
against
a
number
of
cases
that
we
cite
--
and
i
would
commend
them
to
the
court
--
in
which
federal
judges
previous
to
the
sentencing
reform
act
anticipatorily
sentenced.
the
government
and
mr.
setser
have
provided
zero
cases.
mr.
evan
a.
young
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
turns
much
more
on
the
order
of
imprisonment
than
the
order
of
sentencing,
because
the
federal
court
in
mr.
setser's
case,
for
instance,
is
imposing
no
obligation
whatsoever
on
the
state.
the
state--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--well,
let's
take
this
very
case,
for
instance.
mr.
setser
was
sentenced
in
federal
court
first
and
the
federal
court
said:
i
see
that
there
is
coming
a
state
probation
revocation.
i
want
this
federal
sentence,
which
will
be
served
last,
to
have
no
credit
for
whatever
happens
in
state
court.
mr.
evan
a.
young
and
that's
all
he
did
do.
mr.
evan
a.
young
what
the
state
judge
could
not
do
is
to
say:
i
want
this
state
sentence,
which
is
going
to
be
served
first,
to
run
concurrent
to
the
later-served
federal
sentence
because
that
would
require
the
federal
sovereign
to
let
someone
go.
mr.
evan
a.
young
actually--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--can't
force
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
to
do
anything.
mr.
evan
a.
young
precisely.
mr.
evan
a.
young
the
bureau
of
prisons
can
effectuate
that
order
very
easily
once
that's
happened.
mr.
evan
a.
young
i
think
the
best
argument
is
that
the
statute
plainly
does
not
withdraw
any
authority.
it
doesn't
describe
it
at
all.
what
the
statute
does
--
in--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--well,
my
best
argument,
assuming
the
premise
that
it's
a
grant,
which
i
think
is
not
the
best
way
to
read
it,
but
if
it's
a
grant
of
authority,
still
the
correct
answer
is
it
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
anticipatory
context.
and
congress
must
speak
clearly
if
it
will
withdraw
power
from
the
courts.
mr.
evan
a.
young
i
think
it
would
not
be
possible.
mr.
evan
a.
young
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
--
i
think
it
ties
into
justice
breyer's
question.
if
the
federal
judge
sentences
first
and
imprisons
first,
it
could
not
impose
a
consecutive
or
concurrent
term
as
to
the
later-served
state
sentence
either.
the
first
imposed
federal
sentence
will
presumably
be
served
first
in
the
same
bureau
of
prisons.
and
so
there
is
nothing
for
it
yet
to
be
consecutive
or
concurrent
to.
a
second
answer
is
that
all
federal
sentences
are
served
under
the
jailer
of
the
same
sovereign,
the
federal,
whereas
in
the
anticipatory
context
we
have
two
different
systems.
and
so
the
first
sentencing
federal
judge
is
the
only
judge
that
can
compel
the
jailer
of
the
federal
sovereign
to
either
credit
or
not
to
credit.
whereas
in
the
federal
--
federal
system,
under
the
statute,
the
second
judge
is
explicitly
given
the
power
to
alter
the
default
rule.
so
in
all
federal
cases
either
a
default
rule
or
a
judge
will
determine
whether
or
not
a
credit
should
be
given
to
the
defendant.
mr.
evan
a.
young
the
second
federal
judge
can
do
it
but
a
second
state
judge
cannot,
because
this
statute
can
neither
empower
the
state
judge--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--if
the
second
sentence
is
served
second.
but
as
in
this
case
and
many
others,
the
second
sentence
is
served
first.
and
consequently
the
second
sentencing
judge,
the
state
judge
in
mr.
setser's
case,
has
no
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
sentence,
which
will
be
served
first,
will
be
consecutive
or
concurrent.
now,
i
know
there
is
a
lot
of
firsts
and
seconds
going
on
here,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--it's
true.
but
the
same
prisoner
--
if
the
state
sentence
had
happened
10
minutes
before
the
federal
sentence,
the
federal
judge
would
have
plenary
authority
to
impose
a
consecutive
sentence,
even
though
it
would
be
served
last.
and
all
of
that
conduct
that
will
happen
in
the
state
system
would
be
irrelevant.
the
sentence
happens
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
now,
there
is
a
statutory
provision
that
does
describe
exactly
how
the
bureau
of
prisons
should
interact
with
the
courts
in
the
context
of
a
sentence
that
needs
to
be
changed
and
that's
section
3582(c).
and
in
that
statute
the
judge
will
remain
the
decider,
because
the
bureau
of
prisons
goes
as
a
petitioner
and
says
to
the
court:
there
are
compelling
and
extraordinary
reasons
to
modify
this
sentence.
and
then
the
court,
always
in
the
position
of
the
decider
and
using
the
section
3553(a)
factors,
will
decide
whether
or
not
the
bureau
of
prisons'
petition
should
be
granted.
but
never
in
any
statute
is
the
bureau
of
prisons
given
the
authority
to
use
the
sentencing
factors
under
section
3553.
and
in
fact
the
sentencing
factors
that
the
government
contends
would
allow
it
to
make
a
sentencing
determination
under
3621,
page
2a
of
the
government's
merits
brief,
starts
off
with
the
very
preliminary
requirement,
and
i
will
read
from
the
second
sentence
of
3621(b)b:
"the
bureau
may
designate
any
available
penal
or
correctional
facility
that
meets
minimum
standards
of
health
and
habitability
established
by
the
bureau.
"
which
means
that
if
this
is
the
power
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
to
make
a
sentence
concurrent,
a
state
prisoner
in
a
true
hellhole
would
not
be
able
to
get
a
concurrent
sentence.
the
person
most
in
need
of
that
judicial
mercy
would
be
precluded
by
statute
if
we
subject
this
statute
to
anything
like
the
textual
rigor
that
the
government
wants
to
subject
3584
to.
plainly
what
3621(b)
does
is
articulate
a
set
of
principles
that
allows
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
decide
to
which
prisons
defendants
should
go,
not
how
long
they
must
stay
there.
that
is
an
element
of
punishment,
which
is
quintessential
judicial.
this
court
said
in
ex
parte
united
states
--
it's
been
quoted
and
cited
by
courts
across
this
country
for
100
years,
and
in
fact
in
that
case
it
was
said
to
be
so
historically
established
that
it
hardly
merited
comment,
and
now--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--that
is
all
you
have
to
decide.
but
in
so
deciding
you
are
confronting
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
which
is:
no,
no;
congress
has
exclusively
vested
this
sentencing
function
in
us.
mr.
evan
a.
young
should
it
be
the
judge
or
the
jailer?
mr.
evan
a.
young
that's
precisely
the
point.
and
the
argument--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--precisely.
and
to
say
that
congress
has
never
given
it
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
necessarily
means
that
it
is
the
judge.
mr.
evan
a.
young
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
because
what
that
factor
allows
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
do
is
to
decide,
based
upon
the
judgment
here,
is
this
someone
who
needs
to
be
in
the
super-max
or
is
it
someone
that
can
be
in
a
much
more
minimum
security
type
prison?
none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
determination
of
how
long
someone
should
spend
in
prison,
10
years,
20
years.
the
government
says:
it's
all
the
same;
you
will
serve
your
federal
prison
term.
it
doesn't
seem
that
from
the
perspective
of
an
identically
situated
person
who
will
spend
20
years
rather
than
10
years
of
his
life
in
prison.
mr.
evan
a.
young
that's
correct.
and
the
only
situation
in
which
a
prisoner
would
be
harmed
is
if
the
federal
judge
says,
i
want
it
to
be
consecutive,
and
then
the
bureau
of
prisons
comes
in
later,
20
years
later
after
he
is
done
with
the
state
term,
let's
say,
and
says:
boy,
we
would
have
made
this
concurrent,
and
here
are
all
reasons
why.
congress
has
provided
a
means
to
do
that,
section
3582(c).
go
to
the
federal
court
as
the
petitioner,
not
the
decider.
congress
did
not
unilaterally
give
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
power
it
is
now
claiming.
and
so,
for
that
reason--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--in
--
in--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--because
in
the
dual
sovereignty
context
that
second
sentencing
judge
cannot
compel
the
federal
sovereign
to
either
reduce--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--right.
mr.
evan
a.
young
yes.
mr.
evan
a.
young
that
cannot
be
the
case
if
it's
a
state
court
and
the
state
court
does
not
know,
with
respect
to
a
later-served
federal
sentence,
whether
or
not
the
time
will
be
credited.
so
in
other
words,
in
your
example--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--in
the
case
in
which
the
--
the
state
judge
says,
i
want
it
to
be
zero,
then
we
know
that
the
state
relinquishes
its
custody.
and
whatever
happens
later
in
federal
prison,
a
pardon,
let's
say,
or
a
reversal,
that's
--
that's
gone
and
done.
the
state
no
longer
has
claim
on
him.
they
have
sentenced
him
to
zero.
if
the
state
judge
knows,
however,
that
the
federal
court
has
sentenced
someone
to
5
years
and
it
will
be
conservative
because
it's
served
last
to
whatever
the
state
judge
imposes,
the
state
judge
now
is
in
a
position,
and
only
in
that
situation,
is
in
a
position
to
say,
okay,
if
i
give
you
2
years,
you
will
spend
7,
because
i
know
that
the
federal
sentence
will
be
consecutive.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
curtain
is
only
pulled
up
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
at
the
end
and
the
state
judge
says
i
want
you
to
have
10
years,
i
will
sentence
you
to
5,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
pulls
up
the
curtain,
it's
concurrent.
then
only
5
years
has
been
sentenced.
mr.
evan
a.
young
precisely.
the
only
way
to
really
respect
the
second
sentencing
state
judge
is
to
provide
clarity,
rather
than
to
force
that
state
judge
to
guess
the
sentence
in
the
dark
about
what
will
actually
happen
to
this
defendant
later
on
when
he
eventually,
after
state
confinement,
is
transported
to
the
federal
prisons.
this
case
is
only
about
that
situation
in
which
the
first
sentence
is
imposed
by
the
federal
court,
but
before
the
federal
sentence
is
enforced,
all
of
the
state
--
that's
why
the
federal
book
ends,
i
describe
it.
we
start
with
the
federal
sentence,
and
we
end
with
the
imposition,
the
service
of
the
federal
service.
and
in
between
those
two
things,
the
state
sentencing
and
imprisonment
occurs.
and,
so,
the
state
judge
cannot
make
his
sentence
be
concurrent
or
consecutive
to
the
federal
sentence,
because
the
federal
sentence
hasn't
been
imposed
yet.
consequently,
hasn't
been
served
yet.
consequently,
providing
that
state
judge
with
knowledge
about
what
will
happen
is
the
only
way
to
give
that
state
judge
the
respect
the
state
judge
needs
and
requires
to
be
able
to
implement
state
goals
in
a
meaningful
way.
otherwise,
it's
a
guess.
as
you
heard,
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
not
follow,
as
a
matter
of
course,
a
second
sentencing
state
judge's
preference
that
it
be
concurrent
or
consecutive.
that
is
something
that
the
bureau
of
prisons,
as
responsive
to
the
federal
courts,
federal
sovereign,
will
decide
based
upon
what
happens
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
evan
a.
young
i
don't
have
specific
numbers.
it's
difficult
to
find
them,
but
i
think
it's
increasing.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
explosion
of
federal
criminal
law.
there
is
still
far
more
state
and
local
law
enforcement
officers
in
this
country.
and
the
doctrine
why
these
--
why
these
sentences
can
be
imposed
first
and
served
last
is
because
of
the
primary
custody
rule.
because
a
local
or
state
law
enforcement
officer
will
most
likely
arrest
someone
whose
act
will
violate
the
laws
of
both
sovereigns,
that
person
will
be
in
state
custody.
we
now
have
so
many
more
offenses
under
the
federal
criminal
code
than
we
did
even
back
when
congress
passed
the
sentencing
reform
act,
which
goes,
perhaps,
to
justice
kagan's
point,
congress
may
not
really
have
been
thinking
about
this
at
all.
mr.
evan
a.
young
everything
is
silent.
i
think
it
was
not.
as
to
the
question
about
whether
courts
could
impose
concurrent
consecutive
sentences,
what
the
report
says,
footnotes
310,
314,
318,
pages
126,
127,
and
129
of
the
sentencing
report,
there
were
some
courts
that
thought
that
a
prior
statute
stopped
them
from
imposing
only
concurrent
sentences
in
the
dual
sovereignty
context.
congress
made
very
clear
--
in
fact,
it
cited
by
name
united
states
v.
segal,
one
of
the
cases
the
government
cites
for
this
proposition
as
being
incorrect.
we
want
to
make
it
clear
congress
says
in
a
report,
you
can
impose
concurrent
sentences,
but
all
along
conservative
sentences
were
imposed
anticipatorily.
and,
so,
this
is
sort
of
like,
you
know,
the
rule
that
if
someone
cannot
have
m&m's
at
all,
being
held
to
mean
that
you
cannot
have
candy
after
dinner,
if
you
had
snickers
after
dinner
every
night.
once
you
remove
the
obstacle
to
having
m&m's,
then
presumably
you
can
have
them
after
dinner
as
well.
there
was
no
rule
that
you
couldn't
have
any
candy
after
dinner.
there
was
no
rule
that
federal
courts
could
not
sentence
anticipatorily.
there
was
simply
a
statutory
bar
that
some
courts
thought
stopped
them
from
imposing
concurrent
sentences
in
the
dual
sovereignty
context.
mr.
evan
a.
young
i
don't
think
that
that
is
necessarily
true.
i
think
it
makes
it
much
easier.
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
concurrent
and
consecutive
sentencing
is
inherently
and
quintessentially
judicial.
this
court
in
oregon
v.
ice
only
two
terms
ago
regarded
it
that
way.
mr.
evan
a.
young
that's
true
with
greater
frequency.
it
did
happen.
and
the
courts
recognize
this,
and
without
any
concern,
sentence
anticipatorily.
mr.
evan
a.
young
in
that
case,
if
the
choice
is
between
the
judge
and
the
jailer,
i
think
the
choice
is
clear.
if
congress
did
not
specifically
say
that
something
as
quintessentially
judicial
as
deciding
how
long
someone
would
spend
in
prison
must
be
decided
by
the
executive
branch.
questionable
whether
it
could.
but
unless
it
explicitly
said
"this
is
how
we
want
it
to
happen.
"
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
imposing
extra
punishment
or
withdrawing
punishment
is
so
judicial
in
nature
that
even
if
congress
didn't
think
about
it
or
specifically
address
the
problem,
the
tie
certainly
has
to
go--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--well,
let
me
address
what
the
anticipatory
sentencing,
the
federal
judge,
how
he
could
possibly
interfere
with
the
state.
i
don't
think
that
he
can
if
the
state
is
sentencing
second
and
imprisoning
first.
mr.
evan
a.
young
right.
mr.
evan
a.
young
well,
the
question
is
--
that's
the
key
point.
if
it's
an
ongoing
federal
sentence,
i
certainly
agree.
but
the
point
here
is--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--his
federal
sentence
hasn't
begun.
setser
doesn't
begin--
mr.
evan
a.
young
--if
the
state
court
sentence
has
not
been
imposed
and
will
run
second,
a
federal
court
can
say
consecutive
or
concurrent,
but
it
wouldn't
have
any
meaning.
just
as
the
state
court,
if
it
had
tried
to
bar
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
from
keeping
someone
would
have
no
meaning.
there's
nothing
for
it
to
be
consecutive
or
concurrent
to,
if
it's
the
first
sentence
being
served.
so
in
--
in
that
regard,
i
think
the
key
point
is,
a
federal
court
cannot
say,
i'm
the
first
judge
to
sentence
and
my
sentence
will
immediately
begin.
i
want
it
to
be
consecutive
to
another
state
--
future
state
sentence.
it
wouldn't
mean
anything,
because
the
state
would
get
that
prisoner
after
he
satisfied
his
federal
term,
and
the
state
can
do
what
it
wants.
let
him
go,
keep
him
longer.
that's
the
dual
sovereignty
principle.
mr.
evan
a.
young
if
state
law
has
a
particular
requirement
as
federal
law
in
some
cases
--
924(c)
does
--
then
that's
the
way
dual
sovereignty
works
as
well.
but
there
is
never
a
situation
in
which
a
state
judge
is
worse
off
by
having
the
knowledge
of
what
the
federal
court
will
sentence
--
has
sentenced
and
how
that
sentence
will
be
imposed.
again,
if
there
is
a
problem
with
it,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
a
way
to
solve
it,
and
it's
through
section
3582(c).
it's
not
through
a
unilateral
determination,
20
years
later
perhaps,
seeking
the
advice
of
a
judge.
maybe
the
advice
of
the
judge
is
provided
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
and
if
it
can
do
that,
there's
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
be
an
order
that
can
be
enforced
rather
than
a
piece
of
advice
that
is
given
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
judges
decide
how
much
punishment
someone
should
receive.
in
federal
court,
federal
judges
decide
how
long
someone
should
spend
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons.
state
courts
can't
do
it,
but
they
can
adjust
sentences
within
the
strictures
of
state
law
to
account
for
what
they
know
is
coming
if
federal
courts
are
able
to
provide
that
advice.
if
they
cannot
decide
that
issue
and
advise
the
state
court
judge
of
what
will
happen,
then
there
are
situations
that
will
occur
when
the
bureau
of
prisons
administers
these
sentences
--
and
there
is
no
question
about
that
either.
but
the
point
is,
there
is
never
a
situation
in
which
a
judge,
able
and
willing
--
able
to
follow
the
section
3553(a)
factors
and
willing
to
impose
that
sentence,
is
doing
something
that
will
be
worse
for
the
defendant
or
worse
for
the
states
than
if
he
does
not
do
it.
you
contrast
the
two
situations
that
two
equally
situated
people
would
be
in.
on
the
one
hand,
sentencing
in
open
court
by
an
article
iii
judge
subject
to
the
3553(a)
factors
with
direct
review
in
the
courts
for
reasonableness.
on
the
other
hand,
sentencing
by
an
administrator
without
any
of
those
salutary
procedural
protections,
without
direct
review
in
the
courts,
and
based
on
factors
that
determine
to
which
prison
someone
should
go,
not
how
long
they
must
stay
there
for
purposes
of
punishment.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
if
for
none
other,
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
because
it
allows
district
judges,
subject
to
their
wise
exercise
and
sound
exercise
of
discretion,
to
make
these
sentences
to
clarify
things
upfront
for
everyone:
the
defendant,
the
state
courts
and
the
bureau
of
prisons.
20
years,
this
country
has
had
half
of
the
circuits
following
this
practice,
and
there
is
not
one
case
cited
on
the
other
side
showing
that
any
mal-administration
of
justice
has
resulted,
any
lack
of
clarity,
any
problems
with
respect
to
how
these
sentences
are
enforced.
and
that's
because
it
does
the
opposite.
allowing
judges
who
are
able,
in
cases
like
setser's,
no
matter
how
much
time
the
state
gives
for
probation
revocation,
no
federal
credit
should
be
given
to
it.
he
knows
enough.
he
knows
everything
he
needs
to
know
to
make
that
sentence.
he
made
it.
it's
effectuated
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
the
government
has
not
said
once
that
it
cannot
enforce
that
sentence.
and
to
the
extent
that
setser
wishes
to
challenge
how
the
bureau
of
prisons
credits
the
state
order,
the
mechanism
to
do
that
is
to
exhaust
his
administration
--
administrative
remedies
in
the
bop,
and
then
seek
judicial
review
to
determine
whether
that
calculation
was
done
rationally
and
fairly.
this
appeal
is
not
the
place
for
that.
this
appeal
is
to
determine
whether
district
courts
never
have
such
authority.
i
thank
the
court.
