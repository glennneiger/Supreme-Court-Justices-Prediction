but
how
would
the
state
officer
know
if
the
person
is
removable?
i
mean,
that's
sometimes
a
complex
inquiry.
justice

they
did
provide
--
i
mean,
your
position
was
the
federal
legislation
regulates
the
supply
side.
that
leaves
the
demand
side
open.
but
there
is
regulation,
and
the
question
is
whether
anything
beyond
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
--
it's
not
just
that
the
person
is
removable,
but
if
they
use
false
documents
in
seeking
work,
that's
a
federal
crime.
so
we
have
the
--
what
you
call
the
supply
side
is
regulated,
but
you
want
to
regulate
it
more.

mr.
clement,
it
seems
that
the
--
i
would
think
the
largest
hurdle
for
you
is
hines
which
said,
the
registration
scheme
--
congress
enacted
a
complete
registration
scheme
which
the
states
cannot
complement
or
impose
even
auxiliary
regulations.
so
i
don't
see
the
alien
registration
as
a
question
of
obstacle
preemption,
but
appeal
preemption
that
alien
--
we
don't
want
competing
registration
schemes.
we
want
the
registration
scheme
to
be
wholly
federal.
