how
do
they
have
--
well,
the
same
question,
but
--
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
examples.
example
one
is
the
person
is
arrested.
now,
it
says
any
person
who
is
arrested
shall
have
the
person's
immigration
status
determined
before
the
person
is
released.
so
i
wonder
if
they
have
arrested
a
citizen,
he's
hispanic-looking,
he
was
jogging,
he
has
a
backpack,
he
has
water
in
it
and
pedialyte,
so
they
think,
oh,
maybe
this
is
an
illegal
person.
it
happens
he's
a
citizen
of
new
mexico,
and
so
the
driver's
license
doesn't
work.
and
now
they
put
him
in
jail.
and
are
you
--
can
you
represent
to
us
--
i
don't
know
if
you
can
or
not
--
can
you
represent
to
us
he
will
not
stay
in
jail
in
detention
for
a
significantly
longer
period
of
time
than
he
would
have
stayed
in
the
absence
of
section
2(b)?
do
you
want
to
represent
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
you
cannot
represent
that
--
and
i'm
not
surprised
you
don't
want
to
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
fourth
amendment
--
for
--
i
mean,
that's
another
question.
i
don't
know
how
long
the
fourth
amendment
allows.
i
don't
know
on
that.
there
probably
is
a
range
of
things.
but
we
do
know
that
a
person
ordinarily,
for
this
crime,
x,
would
have
been
released
after
a
day.
oh,
you
know,
the
fourth
amendment
would
have
allowed
more.
so
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
in
practice
will
happen?
from
your
representation,
i
think
that
there
will
be
a
significant
number
of
people
--
some
of
whom
won't
be
arrested;
it
takes
11
minutes
for
some.
for
citizens,
it
might
take
two
hours,
it
might
take
two
days.
okay.
there
will
be
a
significant
number
of
people
who
will
be
detained
at
the
stop,
or
in
prison,
for
a
significantly
longer
period
of
time
than
in
the
absence
of
2(b).
is
that
a
fair
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
can
i
make
the
following
statement
in
the
opinion,
and
you
will
say
that's
okay.
imagine
--
this
is
imaginary.
"we
interpret"
--
imagine
--
"we
interpret
section
2(b)
as
not
authorizing
or
requiring
the
detention
of
any
individual
under
2(b),
either
at
the
stop
or
in
prison,
for
a
significantly
longer
period
of
time
than
that
person
would
have
been
detained
in
the
absence
of
2(b).
"
can
i
make
that
statement
in
an
opinion,
and
you'll
say,
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
--
let
me
just
go
back,
because
i
think
--
i'm
trying
to
get
focused
the
question
i
think
others
are
asking,
and
one
way
to
focus
it
is
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
clement.
think
of
2(b),
the
first
sentence.
all
right?
now,
i
can
think
--
i'm
not
saying
they
are
right,
but
if
that
means
you're
going
to
hold
an
individual
longer
than
you
would
have
otherwise,
i
can
think
of
some
arguments
that
it
is
preempted,
and
some
replies.
so
keep
that
out
of
it.
suppose
that
we
were
to
say,
that
sentence,
as
we
understand
it,
does
not
raise
a
constitutional
problem
as
long
as
it
is
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
policeman,
irrespective
of
what
answer
he
gets
from
ice,
cannot
detain
the
person
for
longer
than
he
would
have
done
in
the
absence
of
this
provision.
now,
in
your
view,
is
there
any
preemption
exemption
--
argument
against
--
any
preemption
argument
against
that
sentence
as
i
have
just
interpreted
it?
i
don't
know
what
your
answer
is,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
so,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
in
the
federal
statute,
it
says
in
1373
that
nobody
can
prohibit
or
restrict
any
government
entity
from
making
this
inquiry
of
the
federal
government.
and
then
it
says
that
the
federal
government
has
--
any
agency
--
and
then
it
says
the
federal
has
an
obligation
to
respond.
now,
assuming
the
statute
were
limited
as
i
say,
so
nothing
happened
to
this
individual,
nothing
happened
to
the
person
who's
stopped
that
wouldn't
have
happened
anyway,
all
that
happens
is
the
person
--
the
policeman
makes
a
phone
call.
now
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
if
that
were
the
situation,
and
we
said
it
had
to
be
the
situation,
then
what
in
the
federal
statute
would
that
conflict
with,
where
we
have
two
provisions
that
say
any
policeman
can
call?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
--
that's
--
that's
where
i'm
trying
to
push
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
in
my
mind
i'm
not
clear
what
your
answer
is
to
that.
