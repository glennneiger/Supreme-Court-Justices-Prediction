mr.
clement--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
i
interrupt,
and
turning
to
2(b),
could
you
tell
me
what
the
state's
view
is
--
the
government
proposes
that
it
should
be
read
on
its
face
one
way,
and
i
think
the
state
is
arguing
that
there's
a
narrower
way
to
read
it.
but
am
i
to
understand
that
under
the
state's
position
in
this
action,
the
only
time
that
the
inquiry
about
the
status
of
an
individual
rises
is
after
they've
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
that
individual
for
some
other
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
--
can
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--just
stop
you
there
just
one
moment?
that's
what
i
thought.
so
presumably,
i
think
your
argument
is,
that
under
any
circumstance,
a
police
officer
would
have
the
discretion
to
make
that
call.
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
not
about
whether
you
make
the
call
or
not,
although
the
government
is
arguing
that
it
might
be,
but
on
how
long
you
detain
the
individual,
meaning
--
as
i
understand
it,
when
individuals
are
arrested
and
held
for
other
crimes,
often
there's
an
immigration
check
that
most
states
do
without
this
law.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
government
wants
to
remove
that
individual,
they
put
in
a
warrant
of
detainer.
this
process
is
different.
how
is
it
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
understand
that's
their
argument.
i
can
question
them
about
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
want
to
get
to
how
--
assuming
your
position,
that
doing
it
on
a
--
there's
nothing
wrong
with
doing
it
as
it's
been
done
in
the
past.
whenever
anyone
is
detained,
a
call
could
be
made.
what
i
see
as
critical
is
the
issue
of
how
long,
and
under
--
and
when
is
the
officer
going
to
exercise
discretion
to
release
the
person?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
happens
if
--
this
is
the
following
call
--
the
call
to
the
--
to
the
federal
government.
yes,
he's
an
illegal
alien.
no,
we
don't
want
to
detain
him.
what
does
the
law
say,
the
arizona
law
say,
with
respect
to
releasing
that
individual?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
putting
all
of
this
outside
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
get
a
clear
representation
from
you.
if
on
a
call
to
the
federal
agency,
the
agency
says,
we
don't
want
to
detain
this
alien,
that
alien
will
be
released
or
--
unless
it's
under
6,
is
what
you're
telling
me.
or
under
6,
3,
or
some
--
one
other
of
arizona's
immigration
clauses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
then
tell
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
could
--
does
section
6
permit
an
officer
to
arrest
an
individual
who
has
overstayed
a
visitor's
visa
by
a
day?
they
are
removable,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
definition
of
public
offense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
for
those
of
us
for
whom
legislative
history
has
some
importance,
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
legislative
history
that
the
--
that
the
idea
of
punishing
employees
was
raised,
discussed
and
explicitly
rejected.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
preemption
language
would
be
geared
to
what
was
decided
to
be
punished.
it
seems
odd
to
think
that
the
federal
government
is
deciding
on
employment
sanctions
and
has
unconsciously
decided
not
to
punish
employees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
you
something?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
could
you
answer
justice
scalia's
earlier
question
to
your
adversary?
he
asked
whether
it
would
be
the
government's
position
that
arizona
doesn't
have
the
power
to
exclude
or
remove
--
to
exclude
from
its
borders
a
person
who's
here
illegally.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
a
little
confused.
general,
i'm
terribly
confused
by
your
answer.
okay?
and
i
don't
know
that
you're
focusing
in
on
what
i
believe
my
colleagues
are
trying
to
get
to.
making
the
--
2(b)
has
two
components,
as
i
see
it.
every
person
that's
suspected
of
being
an
alien
who's
arrested
for
another
crime
--
that's
what
mr.
clement
says
the
statute
means
--
the
officer
has
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
--
and
call
the
agency
to
find
out
if
it's
an
illegal
alien
or
not.
he
tells
me
that
unless
there's
another
reason
to
arrest
the
person
--
and
that's
3
and
6,
or
any
of
the
other
provisions
--
but
putting
those
aside,
we're
going
to
stay
just
in
2(b),
if
the
government
says,
we
don't
want
to
detain
the
person,
they
have
to
be
released
for
being
simply
an
illegal
alien,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
taking
out
the
other
provisions,
taking
out
any
independent
state-created
basis
of
liability
for
being
an
illegal
alien?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
the
statistics
as
to
how
many
arrests
there
are
and
how
many
--
and
what
the
--
percentage
of
calls
before
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
get
to
a
different
question?
i
think
even
i
or
someone
else
cut
you
off
when
you
said
there
were
three
reasons
why
--
2(b).
putting
aside
your
argument
that
this
--
that
a
systematic
cooperation
is
wrong
--
you
can
see
it's
not
selling
very
well
--
why
don't
you
try
to
come
up
with
something
else?
because
i,
frankly
--
as
the
chief
has
said
to
you,
it's
not
that
it's
forcing
you
to
change
your
enforcement
priorities.
you
don't
have
to
take
the
person
into
custody.
so
what's
left
of
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please
move--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general,
when
--
when
--
i
know
your
brief,
you
had
--
you
said
that
there
are
some
illegal
aliens
who
have
a
right
to
remain
here.
and
i'm
just
realizing
that
i
don't
really
know
what
happens
when
the
arizona
police
call
the
federal
agency.
they
give
the
federal
agency
a
name,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
really
have
knowledge
of
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
and
what
does
the
computer
have?
what
information
does
your
system
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
does
that
database
tell
you
that
someone
is
illegal
as
opposed
to
a
citizen?
today,
if
you
use
the
names
sonya
sotomayor,
they
would
probably
figure
out
i
was
a
citizen.
but
let's
assume
it's
john
doe,
who
lives
in
grand
rapids.
so
they
are
legal.
is
there
a
citizen
database?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
there
is
or
there
isn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
you
run
out
of
your
house
without
your
driver's
license
or
identification
and
you
walk
into
a
park
that's
closed
and
you're
arrested,
you
--
they
make
the
call
to
this
agency.
you
could
sit
there
forever
while
they--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--figure
out
if
you're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
inviting
--
you're
inviting
the
very
sort
of
conflict
that
he's
talking
about.
because
what's
going
to
happen
now
is
that
if
there
is
no
statement
by
the
federal
agency
of
legality,
the
person
is
arrested,
and
now
we're
going
to
have
federal
resources
spent
on
trying
to
figure
out
whether
they
have
an
asylum
application,
whether
they
have
this,
whether
they
have
that,
whether
they
are
exempted
under
this
reason,
whether
the
failure
to
carry
was
accidental
or
not
--
i
mean,
you
are
involving
the
federal
government
in
your
prosecution.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
you
may
say
we're
not,
because
all
we're
going
to
show
is
--
what?
that
we
got
a
federal
call
--
we
got
a
federal
answer
that
the
person
wasn't
registered?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
--
no
confrontation
--
no
confrontation
clause
problem
with
that?
with
relying
on
a
call
to
a
federal
agency
and
the
police
officer
says,
you're
arrested,
you're
charged,
it's
not
an
illegal
alien
--
or
it
is
an
illegal
alien.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
how
about
--
how
about
they
get
a
response,
yes,
it's
an
illegal
alien?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
--
where
do
they
get
the
records
that
show
that
this
person
is
an
illegal
alien
that's
not
authorized
to
be
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
do
they
get
it
from?
