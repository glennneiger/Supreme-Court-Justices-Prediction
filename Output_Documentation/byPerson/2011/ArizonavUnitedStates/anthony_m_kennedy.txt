justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
takes
two
weeks
to
make
that
determination,
can
the
alien
be
held
by
the
state
for
that
whole
period
of
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
under
section
6?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
would
be
the
standard?
you're
the
attorney
for
the
alien,
he
--
they
are
going
to
hold
him
for
two
weeks
until
they
figure
out
whether
this
is
a
removable
offense,
and
you
say,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
you
cannot
hold
for
--
what?
more
than
a
reasonable
time
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
justice
scalia's
question
was
the
--
was
the
broader
one,
just
as
a
theoretical
matter.
can
we
say,
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
state
must
accept
within
its
borders
a
person
who
is
illegally
present
under
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
by
reason
of
his
alien--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
you
agree
that
--
would
you
accept
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
we
can
begin
with
the
general
principle
that
the
hines
v.
davidowitz
language
controls
here,
and
we're
going
to
ask
our
principal
--
our
primary
function
is
to
determine
whether,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
arizona's
law
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress?
is
that
an
acceptable
test
from
your
standpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
government
on
this
section
is
going
to
come
and
say,
well,
there
may
be
--
this
must
be
--
this
--
the
enforcement
of
this
statute,
as
arizona
describes
it,
will
be
in
considerable
tension
with
our
--
with
our
basic
approach;
isn't
that
what
i'm
going
to
hear
from
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
double
prosecutions
be
--
suppose
that
an
alien
were
prosecuted
under
federal
law
for
violating
basically
the
terms
of
3,
could
the
states
then
prosecute
him
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
hypothetical
is
that
that's
all
the
legislature
is
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
are
you
talking
about
now
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
does
this
argument
relate
to
2
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
--
well,
assume
these
are
two
hypothetical
--
two
hypothetical
instances.
first,
the
federal
government
has
said,
we
simply
don't
have
the
money
or
the
resources
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
the
way
we
wish.
we
wish
we
could
do
so,
but
we
don't
have
the
money
or
the
resources.
that's
the
first
--
just
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
also
hypothetical
is
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
--
has
a
massive
emergency
with
social
disruption,
economic
disruption,
residents
leaving
the
state
because
of
flood
of
immigrants.
let's
just
assume
those
two
things.
does
that
give
the
state
of
arizona
any
powers
or
authority
or
legitimate
concerns
that
any
other
state
wouldn't
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
can
they
go
to
their
legislature
and
say,
we're
concerned
about
this,
and
ask
the
legislature
to
enact
laws
to
correct
this
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
the
government
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
not
enforcing
its
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
of
arizona
has
enacted
a
statute
called
the
support
our
law
enforcement
and
safe
neighborhoods
act.
the
law
is
often
called
in
the
pleadings
and
in
the
opinion
s.
b.
1070.
it
is
designed,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
to
discourage
and
deter
the
unlawful
entry
and
presence
of
economic
activity
by
persons
unlawfully
present
in
the
united
states.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
four
different
provisions
of
the
state
law
are
preempted
and
rendered
invalid
by
federal
immigration
law.
the
federal
power
to
determine
immigration
policy
is
well
settled.
immigration
policy
can
affect
trade,
investment,
tourism,
and
diplomatic
relations
for
the
entire
nation
as
well
as
the
perceptions
and
expectations
of
aliens
in
this
country,
who
seek
full
protection
of
the
laws.
federal
statutes
and
regulations
include
detailed
rules
concerning
when
aliens
may
enter
the
country,
how
--
how
they
must
register,
whether
they
may
work,
and
under
what
circumstances
they
maybe
removed.
this
pervasive
federal
law
does
not
diminish
the
importance
of
immigration
policy
to
the
states.
in
arizona,
each
year
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deportable
aliens
are
apprehended.
evidence
in
this
record
suggests
that
crime,
property
damage,
and
serious
environmental
problems
are
caused
by
the
influx
of
illegal
migration
across
the
border.
these
concerns
are
the
background
for
the
legal
analysis
in
this
case.
now
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
power
to
preempt
state
laws.
there
are
subject
areas
where
federal
regulation
is
so
extensive
or
the
federal
interest
is
so
dominant
that
it
may
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
to
displace
state
law
altogether
and
this
is
called,
field
preemption.
state
laws
will
also
be
found
invalid
if
they
conflict
with
federal
law
and
this
includes
situations
where
state
law
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
objectives
of
congress.
the
four
disputed
provisions
of
s.
b.
1070
must
be
evaluated
accorded
--
according
to
these
principles
and
the
first
provision
to
be
discussed
is
section
3.
this
part
of
s.
b.
1070
makes
it
a
misdemeanor,
a
state
law
misdemeanor,
not
to
comply
with
federal
laws
requiring
aliens
to
complete
and
carry
registration
papers.
in
the
1941
case
of
hines
versus
davidowitz,
the
court
discussed
then
applicable
federal
alien
registration
requirements.
the
framework
congress
had
established
at
that
time
was
described
as
a
complete
system
for
alien
registration.
in
hines,
the
1941
case,
the
court
held
that
states
could
--
could
not
complement
federal
law
or
could
not
enforce
additional
or
auxiliary
regulations.
today,
the
federal
framework
of
alien
registration
rules
remains
comprehensive.
under
the
hines
case
and
based
on
field
preemption,
federal
law
does
bar
the
additional
enforcement
mechanism
provided
in
section
3
and
section
3
of
the
arizona
law
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
next
provision
to
be
discussed
is
section
5(c).
now
this
section
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
for
an
alien
in
arizona
to
seek
or
engage
in
unauthorized
work,
the
penalties
on
the
perspective
or
the
actual
employee.
penalties
include
incarceration
for
up
to
six
months.
now,
in
1986
congress
passed
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
known
as
irca
as
a
comprehensive
framework
for
combating
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens
and
that
law,
the
federal
law
requires
employers
to
verify
the
status
of
their
workers
and
it
punishes
violations
with
civil
and
criminal
penalties.
the
unauthorized
employees
on
the
other
hand
are
generally,
under
the
federal
law,
subject
only
to
civil
penalties.
congress
debated
and
rejected
proposals
to
impose
criminal
penalties
on
them.
the
correct
instruction
to
draw
from
the
text,
design,
and
history
of
the
irca
is
that
congress
decided
these
penalties
would
be
inappropriate
but
authorizing
them
in
section
5(c)
of
the
arizona
law
upsets
the
careful
balance
struck
by
congress.
it
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
federal
law.
section
5(c)
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
next
section
to
be
discussed
is
section
6.
now,
this
section
gives
state
police
officers
authority
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
certain
aliens
who
are
suspected
of
being
removable
from
this
country.
as
a
general
rule,
it
is
not
a
crime
for
a
removable
alien
to
remain
in
the
united
states.
when
an
alien
is
suspected
of
being
removable,
a
federal
official
issues
a
notice
for
him
or
her
to
appear
at
a
hearing.
congress
has
specified
circumstances
when
it
is
appropriate
for
federal
immigration
officers
to
arrest
an
alien
during
the
removal
process.
without
a
federal
warrant,
these
federal
officers
have
limited
authority.
section
6
of
the
state
law
gives
state
officers
greater
authority
to
arrest
aliens
on
the
basis
of
possible
removability
than
congress
has
given
to
trained
federal
immigration
officers.
and
section
6
gives
state
officers
the
power
to
make
these
arrests
without
any
instruction
or
direction
from
the
federal
government.
this
conflicts
with
federal
--
the
federal
statutory
framework
which
identifies
narrow
circumstances
when
state
officers
may
perform
the
functions
of
an
immigration
officer.
now,
in
defense
of
section
6,
arizona
notes
that
a
federal
statute
permits
state
officers
to
cooperate
with
the
attorney
general
in
the
detention
and
removal
of
aliens
not
lawfully
present
in
the
united
states.
now
there
is
some
ambiguity
as
to
what
constitutes
cooperation,
but
no
coherent
understanding
of
that
term
could
include
what
section
6
authorizes,
unilateral
state
action
to
arrest
and
detain
aliens
based
on
their
possible
removability.
section
6
of
the
arizona
law
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
last
section
to
be
discussed
is
section
2(b)
of
the
state
law.
this
requires
state
officers
to
make
a
reasonable
attempt
to
verify
the
immigration
status
of
anyone
they
stop,
detain,
or
arrest
if
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
unlawfully
present
in
united
--
in
the
country.
the
state
law
also
provides
that
any
person
who
is
arrested
shall
have
the
person's
immigration
status
determined
before
the
person
is
released.
by
a
well
established
procedure,
these
state
inquiries
can
be
and
are
directed
to
a
federal
agency.
the
challengers
to
the
state
law
argue
that
section
2(b)
conflicts
with
federal
law
because
the
status
checks
are
made
mandatory,
but
federal
law
does
not
suggest
that
it
is
inappropriate
enough
for
state
officers
to
contact
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
as
a
routine
matter.
instead,
federal
law
encourages
the
sharing
of
the
information
about
possible
immigration
violations.
one
concern
is
that
under
state
law,
officers
will
be
required
to
delay
the
release
of
some
detainees
for
no
reason
other
than
to
verify
their
immigration
status,
but
section
2(b)
can
be
read
to
avoid
this
concern.
if
the
provision
only
requires
state
officers
to
conduct
the
status
check
during
the
course
of
an
authorized
lawful
detention
or
after
a
detainee
has
been
released,
the
provision
would
likely
survive
preemption
at
least
absent
some
showing
that
it
has
other
consequences
that
are
adverse
to
federal
law
in
its
objectives.
without
a
definitive
interpretation
from
the
state
courts,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
assume
at
this
point
that
the
law
will
be
construed
in
a
way
that
conflicts
with
federal
law.
the
court's
opinion
does
not
foreclose
other
preemption
and
constitutional
challenges
to
the
law
after
it
goes
into
effect,
but
in
this
case,
section
2(b)
survives
preemption.
the
national
government
has
significant
power
to
regulate
immigration.
with
power
comes
responsibility
and
the
sound
exercise
of
national
power
over
immigration
depends
on
the
nation's
meeting
its
responsibility
to
base
its
laws
on
a
political
will,
informed
by
searching
thoughtful,
rational,
civic
discourse.
arizona
may
have
understandable
frustrations
with
the
problems
caused
by
illegal
immigration
while
that
process
continues,
but
the
state
may
not
pursue
policies
that
undermine
federal
law.
justice
scalia,
justice
thomas,
and
justice
alito
had
each
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
