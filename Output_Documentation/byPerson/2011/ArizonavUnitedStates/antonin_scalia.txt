justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
if
this
is
a
problem,
is
it
an
immigration
law
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
a
fourth
amendment
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
government's
attack
on
this
that
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'll
concede
that
the
--
that
the
state
has
to
accept
within
its
borders
all
people
who
have
no
right
to
be
there,
that
the
federal
government
has
no
interest
in
removing?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
the
statute
--
and
you
call
up
the
federal
government,
and
te
federal
--
yes,
he's
an
illegal
immigrant,
but
that's
okay
with
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
state
has
no
power
to
close
its
borders
to
people
who
have
no
right
to
be
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
that
means,
it
gives
authority
over
naturalization,
which
we've
expanded
to
immigration.
but
all
that
means
is
that
the
government
can
set
forth
the
rules
concerning
who
belongs
in
this
country.
but
if,
in
fact,
somebody
who
does
not
belong
in
this
country
is
in
arizona,
arizona
has
no
power?
what
does
sovereignty
mean
if
it
does
not
include
the
ability
to
defend
your
borders?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
still
up
to
the
national
government.
arizona
is
not
trying
to
kick
out
anybody
that
the
federal
government
has
not
already
said
do
not
belong
here.
and
the
constitution
provides
--
even
--
even
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
--
"no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports
except.
"
it
says,
"what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws.
"
the
constitution
recognizes
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
state
borders
and
the
states
can
police
their
borders,
even
to
the
point
of
inspecting
incoming
shipments
to
exclude
diseased
material.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
example
where
--
where
enforcement
discretion
has
the
effect
of
preempting
state
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
point
out
another
case
of
ours
where
we've
said
that
essentially
the
preemption
of
state
law
can
occur,
not
by
virtue
of
the
congress
preempting,
but
because
the
executive
doesn't
want
this
law
enforced
so
--
so
rigorously,
and
that
preempts
the
state
from
enforcing
it
vigorously.
do
we
have
any
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
they
do
that
with
all
federal
criminal
statutes.
and
you
acknowledge
that
as
a
general
matter,
states
can
enforce
federal
criminal
law,
which
is
always
entrusted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
sounds
like
racial
profiling
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
federal
immigration
law?
i
mean,
it
may
have
to
do
with
racial
harassment,
but
i
thought
you
weren't
relying
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
objecting
to
harassing
the
--
the
people
who
have
no
business
being
here?
is
that
--
surely
you're
not
concerned
about
harassing
them.
they
have
been
stopped
anyway,
and
all
you're
doing
is
calling
up
to
see
if
they
are
illegal
immigrants
or
not.
so
you
must
be
talking
about
other
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
our
immigration
laws.
okay?
citizens
and
--
and
other
people,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
immigration
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
what
you're
asserting
preempts
all
of
this
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
anyway,
what
--
what's
wrong
about
the
states
enforcing
federal
law?
there
is
a
federal
law
against
robbing
federal
banks.
can
it
be
made
a
state
crime
to
rob
those
banks?
i
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
the
attorney
general
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
we
might
really
only
want
to
go
after
the
professional
bank
robbers?
if
it's
just
an
amateur
bank
robber,
you
know,
we're
--
we're
going
the
let
it
go.
and
the
state's
interfering
with
our
--
with
our
whole
scheme
here
because
it's
prosecuting
all
these
bank
robbers.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
would
anybody
listen
to
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
1306(a)
ought
to
be
amended,
then.
i
mean,
we
have
statutes
out
there
that
there
a
lot
of
people
in
violation
of
it
and
--
well,
the
attorney
general
will
take
care
of
it.
is
that
how
we
write
our
criminal
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
i
ask
you,
do
you
have
any
other
case
in
which
the
basis
for
preemption
has
been
you
are
interfering
with
the
attorney
general's
enforcement
discretion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
an
extraordinary
basis
for
saying
that
the
state
is
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
criminalizing
anything
that
isn't
criminal
under
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
bank.
it's
the
federal
bank
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
state
law
which
criminalizes
the
same
thing
that
the
federal
law
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
didn't
you
say
in
your
brief
--
i
forget
where
it
was
--
i
thought
you
said
that
the
justice
department
doesn't
get
nearly
enough
money
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws?
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
okay.
so
the
state
says,
well,
that
may
be
your
priorities,
but
most
of
these
people
that
you're
not
going
after,
or
an
inordinate
percentage
of
them,
are
here
in
our
state,
and
we
don't
like
it.
they
are
causing
all
sorts
of
problems.
so
we're
going
to
help
you
enforce
federal
law.
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
else.
we're
just
enforcing
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can't
you
avoid
that
particular
foreign
relations
problem
by
simply
deporting
these
people?
look,
free
them
from
the
jails--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
send
them
back
to
the
countries
that
are
--
that
are
objecting.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
enforce
our
laws
in
a
manner
that
will
please
mexico.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
sounded
like
what
you
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
field
preemption;
is
that
your
argument
with
respect
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
uphold
all
the
provisions
of
the
arizona
law.
for
almost
a
century
after
the
constitution
was
ratified,
there
were
no
federal
immigration
laws
except
one
of
the
infamous
alien
--
alien
and
sedition
acts
that
was
discredited
and
allowed
to
expire.
in
that
first
century,
all
regulation
of
immigration
was
by
the
states,
which
excluded
various
categories
of
would
be
immigrates,
including
convicted
criminals
and
indigents.
indeed,
many
questioned
whether
the
federal
government
had
any
power
to
control
immigration.
that
was
jefferson's
and
madison's
objection
to
the
alien
act.
the
state's
power
to
control
immigration,
however,
has
always
been
accepted
and
is
indeed
reflected
in
some
provisions
of
the
constitution.
the
provision
that,
"the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states
was
a
revision
of
the
provision
in
the
article
of
--
articles
of
confederation
which
gave
those
privileges
and
immunities,
not
to
citizens
of
other
states
but
to
inhabitants
of
other
states."
it
was
revised
because
giving
that
protection
to
mere
inhabitants
would
allow
the
immigration
policies
of
one
state
to
be
imposed
on
the
others.
even
that
revision
was
thought
not
to
be
enough
because
the
states
were
not
willing
to
have
their
immigration
policies
determined
even
by
the
citizenry
--
citizenship
requirements
of
other
states,
hence
the
naturalization
clause
of
the
constitution
which
enables
the
federal
government
to
control
who
can
be
a
citizen.
of
course
the
federal
power
to
control
immigration
was
ultimately
accepted
and
rightly
so,
but
where
does
that
power
come
from?
jefferson
and
madison
were
correct
that
it
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
constitution's
enumeration
of
federal
powers.
the
federal
power
over
immigration
cannot
plausibly
derive
from
the
naturalization
clause
which
is
what
the
government
asserted.
not
only
does
the
power
to
confer
citizenship
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
power
to
exclude
immigrants,
but
as
i
have
described,
the
naturalization
clause
was
a
vindication
of
state
rather
than
federal
power
over
immigration.
federal
power
over
immigration
comes
from
the
same
source
as
state
power
over
immigration.
it
is
an
inherent
attribute,
perhaps
the
fundamental
attribute
of
sovereignty.
the
states
of
course
are
sovereign,
the
united
states
being
a
union
of
sovereign
states.
to
be
sovereign
is
necessarily
to
possess
the
power
to
exclude
unwanted
persons
and
things
from
the
territory.
that
is
why
the
constitution's
prohibition
of
a
state's
imposing
duties
on
imports
made
an
exception
for
"what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws."
thus,
this
court's
cases
have
held
that
the
states
retain
an
inherent
power
to
exclude.
that
power
can
be
limited
only
by
the
constitution
or
by
laws
enacted
pursuant
to
the
constitution.
the
constitution
as
we
have
seen
does
not
limit
a
state's
power,
but
to
the
contrary
vindicates
it
so
the
question
in
this
case
is
quite
simply
whether
the
laws
of
the
united
states
forbid
what
arizona
has
done.
our
cases
have
held
with
regard
to
claimed
federal
abridgement
by
law
of
another
inherent
sovereign
power
of
the
states
namely,
their
sovereign
immunity
from
suit,
that
any
abridgement
by
congress
must
be
"unequivocally
expressed."
the
same
requirement
must
apply
here
and
there
is
no
unequivocal
congressional
prohibition
of
what
arizona
has
done.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
the
federal
immigration
laws
implicitly
"occupy
the
field,‚Äù
so-called
field
preemption.
no
federal
law
says
that
the
states
cannot
have
their
own
immigration
law.
of
course
the
supremacy
clause
establishes
that
federal
immigration
law
is
supreme
so
that
the
state's
immigration
laws
cannot
conflict
with
it,
cannot
admit
those
whom
federal
law
would
exclude
or
exclude
those
whom
federal
law
would
admit,
but
that
has
not
occurred
here.
arizona
has
attached
consequences
under
state
law
to
acts
that
are
unlawful
under
federal
law.
illegal
aliens'
presence
in
arizona
and
their
failure
to
maintain
what
they
have
on
their
person
evidence
of
federal
alien
registration.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
a
state
law
to
impose
additional
penalties
or
attach
additional
consequences
to
acts
that
are
unlawful
under
federal
law.
state
drug
laws
are
a
good
example.
that
does
not
conflict
with
federal
law.
in
sum,
arizona
is
entitled
to
impose
additional
penalties
and
consequences
for
violations
of
federal
immigration
laws
because
it
is
entitled
to
have
its
own
immigration
laws.
as
my
opinion
describes
in
more
detail,
however,
most
of
the
provisions
challenged
here
do
not
even
impose
additional
penalties
or
consequences
for
violation
of
federal
immigration
laws.
they
merely
--
they
merely
apply
stricter
enforcement.
the
federal
government
would
have
us
believe
and
the
court
today
agrees
that
even
that
is
forbidden.
the
government's
briefs
--
brief
asserted
that,
"the
executive
branch's
ability
to
exercise
discretion
and
set
priorities
is
particularly
important
because
of
the
need
to
allocate
scarce
enforcement
resources
wisely."
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
federal
executives
need
to
allocate
its
scarce
enforcement
resources,
should
disable
arizona
from
devoting
its
resources
to
illegal
immigration
in
arizona
then
in
its
view,
the
federal
executive
has
given
short
shrift.
arizona
asserts
without
contradiction
and
with
supporting
citations
the
following,
"in
the
last
decade,
federal
enforcement
efforts
have
focused
primarily
on
california
and
texas
leaving
arizona's
border
to
suffer
from
comparative
neglect.
the
result
has
been
the
funneling
of
an
increasing
tide
of
illegal
border
crossings
into
arizona.
indeed,
over
the
past
decade,
over
a
third
of
the
nation's
illegal
border
crossings
occurred
in
arizona."
must
arizona's
ability
to
protect
its
borders
yield
to
the
reality
that
congress
has
provided
inadequate
funding
for
federal
enforcement
or
even
worse,
to
the
executive's
unwise
targeting
of
that
funding,
but
leave
that
aside.
it
has
become
clear
that
federal
enforcement
priorities
in
the
sense
of
priorities
based
on
the
need
to
allocate
scarce
enforcement
resources
is
not
the
problem
here.
after
this
case
was
argued
and
while
it
was
under
consideration,
the
secretary
of
home
land
security
announced
a
program
exempting
from
immigration
enforcement
some
1.4
million
illegal
immigrants.
a
husbanding
of
scarce
enforcement
resources
can
hardly
be
the
justification
for
this
since
those
resources
will
be
eaten
up
by
the
considerable
administrative
cost
of
conducting
the
non-enforcement
program
which
will
require
as
many
as
1.4
million
background
checks
and
by
any
rulings
on
request
for
dispensation.
the
president
has
said
that
the
new
program
is
"the
right
thing
to
do"
in
light
of
congress'
failure
to
pass
the
administration's
proposed
revision
of
the
immigration
laws.
perhaps
it
is,
though
arizona
may
not
think
so.
but
to
say
as
the
court
does,
that
arizona
contradicts
federal
law
by
enforcing
applications
of
federal
immigration
law
that
the
president
declines
to
enforce
boggles
the
mind.
the
court's
opinion
paints
what
it
considers
a
looming
specter
of
unutterable
horror,
"if
section
3
of
the
arizona
statute
were
valid,
every
state
could
give
itself
independent
authority
to
prosecute
federal
registration
violations."
that
seems
to
me
not
so
horrible
and
even
less
looming,
but
there
has
come
to
pass
and
is
with
us
today,
the
specter
that
arizona
and
the
states
that
supported,
predicted,
a
federal
government
that
does
not
want
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
as
written
and
leaves
the
states'
borders
unprotected
against
immigrants
whom
those
laws
would
exclude.
so
the
issue
was
a
stark
one.
are
the
sovereign
states
at
the
mercy
of
the
federal
executive's
refusal
to
enforce
the
nation's
immigration
laws?
a
good
way
of
answering
that
question
is
to
ask,
would
the
states
conceivably
have
entered
into
the
union
if
the
constitution
itself
contained
the
court's
holding
today?
imagine
a
provision
perhaps
inserted
right
after
article
1,
section
8,
clause
4
of
the
naturalization
clause
which
included
among
the
enumerated
powers
of
congress
the
following,
"to
establish
limitations
upon
immigration
that
will
be
exclusive
and
that
will
be
enforced
only
to
the
extent
the
president
deems
appropriate."
the
delegates
to
the
grant
convention
would
have
rushed
to
the
exits
from
independence
call
--
from
independence
hall.
as
is
often
the
case,
discussions
of
the
dry
legalities,
that
are
the
proper
object
of
our
attention,
supresses
the
very
human
realities
that
gave
rise
to
this
suit.
arizona
bears
the
brunt
of
the
country's
illegal
immigration
problem.
its
citizens
feel
themselves
under
siege
by
large
numbers
of
illegal
immigrants
who
invade
their
property,
strain
their
social
services,
and
even
place
their
lives
in
jeopardy.
federal
officials
have
been
unable
to
remedy
the
problem
and
indeed
have
recently
shown
that
they
are
simply
unwilling
to
do
so.
arizona
has
moved
to
protect
its
sovereignty,
not
in
contradiction
of
federal
law,
but
in
complete
compliance
with
it.
the
laws
under
challenge
do
not
extend
or
revise
federal
immigration
restrictions
but
merely
enforce
those
restrictions
more
effectively.
if
securing
its
tenant
--
its
territory
in
this
fashion
is
not
within
the
power
of
arizona,
we
should
cease
referring
to
it
as
a
sovereign
state.
for
these
reasons,
i
dissent.
