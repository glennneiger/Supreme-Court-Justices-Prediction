justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
you
move
on
to
the
registration
requirement,
could
i
take
you
back
to
an
example
that's
similar
to
the
one
that
justice
breyer
was
referring
to.
let's
someone
--
let's
say
someone
who
is
a
citizen
and
a
resident
of
new
mexico,
has
a
new
mexico
driver's
license,
drives
across
the
border,
is
stopped
for
speeding,
not
60
miles
an
hour
in
a
20-mile
zone,
but
10
miles
over
the
speed
limit
on
an
interstate.
and
the
officer,
for
some
reason,
thinks
that
this
person
may
be
an
illegal
alien.
how
would
that
work
out?
if
you
do
the
records
check,
you're
not
going
to
get
anything
back,
right,
because
the
person
is
a
citizen?
so
what
--
where
would
the
officer
take
it
from
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
it
dispel
reasonable
suspicion
if
it's
--
if
the
officer
knows
it's
a
state
that
issues
driver's
licenses
to
aliens
who
are
not
lawfully--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
may
be
the
case,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
general
verrilli
about
that;
but,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
presumably,
if
the
officer
can
arrest,
the
state
officer
can
arrest
a
person
simply
on
the
ground
that
the
person
is
removable,
which
is
what
the
office
of
legal
counsel
opined
some
years
ago,
then
presumably
the
officer
could
continue
to
detain
that
individual
that
i
mentioned
until
they
reached
a
point
where
the
terry
stop
becomes
an
arrest,
at
which
time
they
would
have
to
have
probable
cause.
but
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
the
person
was
removable,
then
they
could
hold
the
person,
presumably,
until
the
person's
status
was
completely
verified;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
that
regard,
we
are
told
that
there
are
some
important
categories
of
aliens
who
can't
obtain
registration,
cannot
obtain
federal
registration,
and
yet
they
are
people
that
nobody
would
think
should
be
removed.
i
think
someone
with
a
pending
asylum
application
would
fall
into
that
category.
how
would
section
3
apply
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
of
course,
if
you've
entered
the
country
illegally,
you
can't
get
a
registration.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
i
understand
the
distinction
you're
drawing,
that
you
can't
be
prosecuted
for
lack
of
a
registration
if
you
couldn't
have
gotten
a
registration.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
have
the
same
question
as
the
chief
justice.
suppose
that
the
federal
government
changed
its
priorities
tomorrow,
and
it
said
--
they
threw
out
the
ones
they
have
now,
and
they
said
the
new
policy
is
maximum
enforcement,
we
want
to
know
about
every
person
who's
stopped
or
arrested,
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
their
immigration
status
verified.
would
the
arizona
law
then
be
un-preempted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
every
--
suppose
every
law
enforcement
officer
in
arizona
saw
things
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
arizona
legislature.
and
so,
without
any
direction
from
the
legislature,
they
all
took
it
upon
themselves
to
make
these
inquiries
every
time
they
stopped
somebody
or
arrested
somebody.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
federal
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
they
said,
well,
we
don't
care
at
your
priorities
are;
we
have
our
priorities,
and
our
priority
is
maximum
enforcement,
and
we're
going
to
call
you
in
every
case?
it
was
all
done
on
an
individual
basis,
all
the
officers
were
individually
doing
it--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
would
be
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
i
can't
understand
because
your
argument
--
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
what's
wrong
with
the
arizona
law
is
that
the
arizona
legislature
is
trying
to
control
what
its
employees
are
doing,
and
they
have
to
be
free
to
disregard
the
desires
of
the
arizona
legislature,
for
whom
they
work,
and
follow
the
priorities
of
the
federal
government,
for
whom
they
don't
work.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
i
ask
you
this
about
2,
before
you
move
on
to
that?
how
is
a
--
this
is
just
a
matter
of
information.
how
can
a
state
officer
who
stops
somebody
or
who
arrests
somebody
for
a
nonimmigration
offense
tell
whether
that
person
falls
within
the
federal
removal
priorities
without
making
an
inquiry
to
the
federal
government?
for
example,
i
understand
one
of
the
priorities
is
people
who
have
previously
been
removed,
then
that
might
be
somebody
who
you
would
want
to
arrest
and
--
and
remove.
but
how
can
you
determine
that
without
making
the
--
the
inquiry
in
the
first
place?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
they
just,
they
stop
somebody
for
a
traffic
violation,
but
they
want
to
know
whether
this
is
a
person
who
previously
was
removed
and
has
come
back
or
somebody
who
has
just
--
just
within
the
last
few
hours
possibly
come
--
well,
let's
just
--
somebody
who's
previously
been
removed?
how
can
you
know
that
without
making
an
inquiry?
