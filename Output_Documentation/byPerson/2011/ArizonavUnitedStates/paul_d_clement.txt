mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
arizona
bears
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
costs
of
illegal
immigration.
in
addressing
those
costs,
arizona
borrowed
the
federal
standards
as
its
own,
and
attempted
to
enlist
state
resources
in
the
enforcement
of
the
uniform
federal
immigration
laws.
notwithstanding
that,
the
united
states
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
seeking
a
preliminary
injunction
to
enjoin
the
statute
as
impliedly
preempted
on
its
face
before
it
took
effect.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
respect
to
four
provisions,
but
only
by
inverting
fundamental
principles
of
federalism.
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
demanded
that
arizona
point
to
specific
authorization
in
federal
statute
for
its
approach.
but
that
gets
matters
backwards.
a
state
does
not
need
to
point
to
federal
authorization
for
its
enforcement
efforts.
rather,
the
burden
is
on
the
parties
seeking
to
preempt
a
duly
enacted
state
law
to
point
to
some
provision
in
statutory
law
that
does
the
preempting.
now,
the
united
states
can't
really
do
that
here,
and
the
reason
is
obvious.
there
are
multiple
provisions
of
the
federal
immigration
law
that
go
out
of
their
way
to
try
to
facilitate
state
and
local
efforts
to
communicate
with
federal
immigration
officials
in
order
to
ascertain
the
immigration
status
of
individuals.
so,
for
example,
1373(c)
specifically
requires
that
federal
immigration
officials
shall
respond
to
inquiries
from
state
and
local
officials
about
somebody's
immigration
status.
1373(a)
goes
even
further.
that
provision
says
that
no
federal
agency
or
officer
may
prohibit
or
in
any
way
restrict
the
ability
of
state
and
local
officers
to
communicate
with
federal
immigration
officers
to
ascertain
somebody's
immigration
status.
indeed,
if
the
dhs
had--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
justice
sotomayor.
so
this
only
operates
when
somebody's
been
essentially
stopped
for
some
other
infraction,
and
then
at
that
point,
if
there's
reasonable
suspicion
to
try
to
identify
immigration
status,
then
that
can
happen.
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it's
different
in
one
important
respect,
justice
sotomayor,
and
that's
why
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
that
divides
the
parties
is
only
the
issue
of
how
long
you
can
detain
somebody.
because
i
think
the
federal
government
takes
the
rather
unusual
position
that
even
though
these
stops
and
these
inquiries,
if
done
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
become
preempted
if
they're
done
on
a
systematic
basis--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
but
--
so
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
with
respect,
i
don't
think
section
2(b)
really
speaks
to
that,
which
is
to
say,
i
don't
think
section
2(b)
says
that
the
systematic
inquiry
has
to
take
any
longer
than
the
ad
hoc
inquiry.
and,
indeed,
section
2
--
in
one
of
its
provisions
--
specifically
says
that
it
has
to
be
implemented
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
federal,
both
immigration
law
and
civil
rights
law.
so,
there--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
speaks
to
it
in
specific
terms,
but
here's
what
i
believe
would
happen,
which
is
to
say,
at
that
point,
then,
the
officer
would
ask
themselves
whether
there's
any
reason
to
continue
to
detain
the
person
for
state
law
purposes.
i
mean,
it
could
be
that
the
original
offense
that
the
person
was
pulled
over
needs
to
be
dealt
with
or
something
like
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
--
but
if
what
we're
talking
about
is
simply
what
happens
then
for
purposes
of
the
federal
immigration
consequences,
the
answer
is
nothing.
the
individual
at
that
point
is
released.
and
that,
i
think,
can
be
very
well
illustrated
by
section
6
--
i
don't
want
to
change
the
subject
unnecessarily,
but
there
is
arrest
authority
for
somebody
who
has
committed
a
public
offense,
which
means
that
it's
a
crime
in
another
state
and
in
arizona,
but
the
person
can't
be
arrested
for
that
offense
presumably
because
they
have
already
served
their
sentence
for
the
offense;
and
then
there
is
new
arrest
authority
given
to
the
officer
to
hold
that
person
if
they
are
deportable
for
that
offense.
now,
i
think
in
that
circumstance,
it's
very
clear
what
would
happen,
is
an
inquiry
would
be
made
to
the
federal
officials
that
would
say,
do
you
want
us
to
transfer
this
person
to
your
custody
or
hold
this
person
until
you
can
take
custody?
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
that's
the
end
of
it.
that
individual
is
released,
because
there
is
no
independent
basis
in
that
situation
for
the
state
officer
to
continue
to
detain
the
individual
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there's
two
answers
to
that.
one
is,
you're
right,
sometimes
it's
a
complex
inquiry,
sometimes
it's
a
straightforward
inquiry.
it
could
be
murder,
it
could
be
a
drug
crime.
but
i
think
the
practical
answer
to
the
question
is
by
hypothesis
there
is
going
to
be
inquiry
made
to
the
federal
immigration
authorities,
either
the
law
enforcement
support
center
or
a
287(g)
officer.
and
presumably,
as
a
part
of
that
inquiry,
they
can
figure
out
whether
or
not
this
is
a
removable
offense
or
at
least
a
substantially
likely
removable
offense.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that,
you
know,
what
--
in
all
of
these
provisions,
you
have
the
fourth
amendment
backing
up
the
limits,
and
i
think
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
ultimately,
it's
a
reasonable
inquiry.
and
i
think
that
under
these
circumstances
what
we
know
from
the
record
here
is
that
generally
the
immigration
status
inquiry
is
something
that
takes
10
or
11
minutes.
i
mean,
so
it's
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
something
--
or
no
more
than
10
if
it's
a
287(g)
officer
and
roughly
11
minutes
on
average
if
it's
the
law
enforcement
support
center.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
want
to
represent
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
sure.
but
what
i
can
represent--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
that
he's
not
going
to
be
detained
any
longer
than
the
fourth
amendment
allows.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
breyer,
and
here's
why
it's
not.
because
even
though
there
certainly
are
situations
where
state
authorities
will
arrest
somebody
and
then
release
them
relatively
rapidly,
they
generally
don't
release
somebody
until
they
can
nail
down
their
identity
and
whether
or
not
they
are
likely
to
come
to
a
court
hearing
at
a
subsequent--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
it
is
neither--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
of
course
the
federal
government,
that
also
has
a
lot
of
immigration
arrests
that
are
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment,
is
not
making
a
fourth
amendment
claim
here.
and
it's
neither
an
immigration
law
concern
or
something
that
should
be
the
basis
for
striking
down
a
statute
on
its
face.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
i
do
want
to
--
but
i
do
want
to
be
responsive
and
make
the
point
that
i
think
the
factual
premise
that
this
is
going
to
--
2(b)
is
going
to
lead
to
the
elongation
of
a
lot
of
arrests
is
not
true.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
what
you
could
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
you
can
say
just
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
you
can
say
something
similar,
though.
i
think
you
probably
could
say,
look,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
the
statute's
never
gone
into
effect.
we
don't
anticipate
that
section
2(b)
would
elongate
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
the
detention
or
the
arrest.
i
think
you
could
say
that.
and
the
reason
is,
as
i
indicated,
it's
something
that
happens
even
without
this
law
that,
when
you
arrest
somebody,
and
there
are
some
offenses
that
are
--
you
can
arrest
and
release
under
state
law,
but
before
you
release
the
individual,
you
generally
want
to
ascertain
that
that
individual
is
going
to
show
up
at
the
hearing,
and
that's
what
really
distinguishes
those
cases
where
there's
arrest
and
release
from
those
cases
where
there's
arrest
and
you
book
somebody.
now,
here's
the
other
reason
why
i
don't
think
factually
this
is
going
to
elongate
things.
because
already
in
a
significant
number
of
booking
facilities
in
arizona,
you
already
have
the
process
that
people
are
systematically
run
through
immigration
checks
when
they
are
booked
as
part
of
the
booking
process.
that's
reflected
in
the
record
here
in
the
maricopa
county
system,
that
that's
done
by
a
287(g)
officer
as
a
matter
of
routine.
the
federal
government
doesn't
like
this
statute,
but
they
are
very
proud
of
their
secure
communities
program.
and
their
secure
communities
program
also
makes
clear
that
everybody's
that's
booked
at
participating
facilities
is
--
eventually
has
their
immigration
status
checked.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
this
immigration
status
check
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
substantial
elongation
of
the
stops
or
the
detentions.
now,
obviously--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly.
obviously,
if
this
is
somebody
who
was
going,
you
know,
60
miles
an
hour
in
a
20-mile-an-hour
school
zone
or
something,
they
may
decide
wholly
apart
from
the
immigration
issues,
that
this
is
somebody
they
want
to
bring
back
to
the
station.
but
for
the
purposes
of
once
they
make
the
contact
with
federal
immigration
officials,
if
the
federal
immigration
officials
say,
look,
we
have
no
interest
in
removing
this
person,
we
have
no
interest
in
prosecuting
this
person
under
the
federal
criminal
provisions,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
federal
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
accept
that,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
here's
my
response,
which
is
all
of
this
discussion,
at
least
as
i've
understood
it,
has
been
about
2(b)
and
to
a
lesser
extent
6.
now,
section
3
of
the
statute
does
provide
an
authority
under
state
law
to
penalize
somebody
who
has
violated
essentially
the
federal
registration
requirement.
so
if
that's
--
as
to
that
provision,
there
would
be
a
state
authority,
even
under
these
hypotheticals,
to
take
action
with
respect
to
the
individual--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
not
with
respect
to
the
federal--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
think
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
i
think
the
reason
my
answer
is
no
has
more
to
do
with
our
defense
of
section
3
and
other
provisions
than
it
does
with
respect
to
the
inquiry
and
arrest
authority
provisions,
2(b)
and
6.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
i
can
just
kind
of
work
back
for
a
second.
i
mean,
obviously,
it's
a
pretty
unusual
circumstance
where
somebody
produces
an
out-of-state
driver's
license,
and
that
doesn't
dispel
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
officer;
but,
i'll
take
the
hypo--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
that
might
be
a
situation
where
that's
the
case,
and
then
--
then
it
wouldn't
dispel
the
reasonable
suspicion.
but,
say,
in
the
average
case,
i
think
it
would.
they
would
then
go
further.
and
then
they
would
then
make
the
inquiry
to
the
federal
officials.
and
then
if
--
because
of
the
fact
that
the
individual
actually
is
a
citizen
or
something
like
that,
then
what
would
happen
is
at
some
point
you'd
get
to
the
end
of
a
permissible
terry
stop,
and
the
officer
would
release
the
individual.
now,
it
might
not
be
the
end
of
the
matter,
because,
of
course,
you
know,
they
still
have
the
name,
they
still
have
the
ability
to
collect
that
information
and
try
to
continue
the
check
as
they
move
forward,
taking
down
the
information
on
the
new
mexico
driver's
license.
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that,
you
know,
this
statute
doesn't
authorize
them
to
detain
the
individual,
certainly
beyond
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
limits,
and
it
really
doesn't
authorize
them
to
do
anything
that
the
official
couldn't
do
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
without
the
statute.
now
it
does
do--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
as
we
read
section
6,
because
there's
a
pre-existing
definition
of
public
offense
in
arizona
law,
we
don't
think
this
is
kind
of
the
full
office
of
legal
counsel
situation,
where
you
have
broad
arrest
authority
for
removable
individuals.
this
is
a
relatively
narrow
slice
of
additional
arrest
authority
that
happens
to
give
arrest
authority
for
people
that
seem
to
fit
the
federal
government's
priority,
because
it
really
is
going
to
apply
to
criminal
aliens.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
take
any
issue
with
what
you're
saying.
i
do
think,
though,
it's
important
to
understand
that
2(b)
really
doesn't
give
the
officer
an
authority
he
didn't
otherwise
have.
it
does
do
one
thing
that's
very
important,
though,
which
it
does
have
the
effect
of
overriding
local
policies
that
actually
forbade
some
officers
from
making
those
communications
and
--
because
that's
one
of
the
primary
effects
of
2(b).
it
just
shows
how
difficult
the
government's
preemption
argument
is
here,
because
those
kind
of
local
policies
are
expressly
forbidden
by
federal
statute.
1373(a)
and
8
u.s.c.
1644
basically
say
that
localities
can't
have
those
kind
of
sanctuary
laws.
and
so,
one
effect
that
2(b)
has
is
on
a
state
level
it
basically
says,
look,
you
can't
have
local
officers
telling
you
not
to
make
those
inquiries,
you
must
have
those
inquiries.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
are
removable.
i
don't
think
they
would
have
committed
a
public
offense
--
absent
a
very
unusual
situation,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
committed
a
public
offense
under
arizona
law.
so
i
don't
think
there
actually
would
be
arrest
authority
in
that
circumstance,
as
justice
alito's
question
has--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
public
offense
definition
--
it's
actually
--
it's
a
petition
appendix
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
the
definition
is
basically
that
it's
something
that
is
a
crime
in
another
jurisdiction
and
also
a
crime
in
arizona.
and
so,
what
makes
this
kind
of
anomalous
is,
normally,
if
something
is
a
crime
in
arizona,
there's
arrest
authority
for
that
directly.
so
what
this
really
captures
is
people
who
have
committed
a
crime
are
no
longer
arrestable
for
the
crime
because
they
have
served
their
sentence
or
some
other
peculiarity,
but
they
are
nonetheless
removable
because
of
the
crime.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
it's
certainly
imposing
different
sanctions.
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
a
little
bit
--
kind
of
hard
to
weigh
the
difference
between
removability,
which
is
obviously
a
pretty
significant
sanction
for
an
alien,
and
the
relatively
modest
penalties
imposed
by
section
5(c).
but
i
take
the
premise
that
5(c)
does
something
that
there
is
no
direct
analog
in
federal
law.
but
i
--
but
that's
not
enough
to
get
you
to
preemption,
obviously.
and
one
of
the
things
that
makes
5(c),
it
seems
to
us,
a
weak
case
for
preemption
is
that
it
only
targets
employment
that
is
expressly
forbidden
by
federal
law.
and
so,
then
we
look
at,
you
know,
essentially
the
government
is
reduced
to
arguing
that
because
in
1986
when
congress
passed
irca,
it
only
focused
on
the
employer's
side
of
the
equation
and
didn't,
generally
speaking,
impose
restrictions
on
employees,
that
somehow
they
are
going
to
draw
a
preemptive
inference
from
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it's
an
acceptable
test.
i
mean,
justice
kennedy,
you
know,
there
obviously
have
been
subsequent
cases,
including
decanas
and
whiting,
that
give
additional
shape
and
color
to
that
test,
but
i
don't
have
any
--
i
don't
have
any
real
quarrel
with
that
test.
and
here's
why
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
may
be
what
you're
going
to
hear,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
don't
think
you
just
take
the
federal
government
for
its
word
on
these
things.
you
know,
it's
interesting,
in
decanas
itself,
the
sg
said
that
that
california
statute
was
preempted.
and
in
decanas,
this
court
didn't
say,
well,
you
know,
we've
got
this
language
from
hines,
and
we
have
the
sg
tell
us
it's
preempted,
that's
good
enough
for
us.
they
went
beyond
that,
and
they
looked
hard.
and
what
they
did
is
they
established
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
presumption
against
preemption
applies.
so,
that
seems
one
strike
in
our
favor.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
there
is
an
express
preemption
provision,
and
it
--
it
only
addresses
the
employer's
side
of
the
ledger.
so
the
express
preemption
provision
clearly
doesn't
apply
here.
so
the
only
thing
they
have
is
this
inference--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
justice
sotomayor,
there's
a
big
difference
between
congress
deciding
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
address
employees
with
an
additional
criminal
prohibition,
and
saying
that
that
decision
itself
has
preemptive
effect.
that's
a
rather
remarkable
additional
step.
and
here's
why
i
think,
if
you
consider
the
legislative
history,
for
those
who
do,
it
really
supports
us,
because
here's
what
congress
confronted.
i
mean,
they
started
thinking
about
this
problem
in
1971.
they
passed
irca
in
1986.
at
that
point,
here's
the
state
of
the
world.
it's
already
unlawful,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
for
the
employee
to
get
--
to
have
this
unlawful
work;
and,
if
they
seek
this
unlawful
work,
they
are
subject
to
removal
for
doing
it.
in
addition,
congress
was
told
that
most
of
the
aliens
who
get
this
unlawful
work
are
already
here
--
they
illegally
entered,
so
they
are
already
subject
to
an
independent
criminal
offense.
so
at
that
point,
congress
is
facing
a
world
where
the
employee
is
already
subject
to
multiple
prohibitions.
the
employer
is
completely
scot-free
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
so
at
that
point,
in
1986,
they
address
the
employer's
side
of
the
equation,
they
have
an
express
preemption
provision
that
says
nothing
about
any
intent
of
preempting
the
employee's
side
of
the
ledger,
and
in
that
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--two
quick
responses,
and
then
i'd
like
to
save
time
for
rebuttal,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
if
you
look
at
what
they
regulate
on
the
employee's
side,
it's
really
things
that
actually
assist
in
regulating
the
employer's
side.
because
what
they
are
worried
about
is
a
fraudulent
document
that
then
is
used
essentially
to
trick
the
employer
into
employing
somebody
who
shouldn't
be
employed.
the
second
thing
is
the
more
that
you
view
irca
as
actually
regulating
part
of
the
employee's
side,
then
i
think
the
more
persuasive
it
is
that
the
express
preemption
provision
doesn't
reach
the
employee's
side
of
the
equation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
i
do
think
as
to
section
3,
the
question
is
really
--
it's
a
provision
that
is
parallel
to
the
federal
requirements
and
imposes
the
same
punishments
as
the
federal
requirement.
so
it's
generally
not
a
fertile
ground
for
preemption.
but
of
course,
there
are
cases
that
find
preemption
even
in
those
analogous
circumstances.
they
are
the
cases
that
the
government
is
forced
to
rely
on,
cases
like
buckman,
cases
like--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
they
could
under
general
double
jeopardy
principles
and
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine.
obviously,
if
that
was
a
particular
concern
to
you,
that
might
be
the
basis
as
an
as-applied
challenge
if
somebody
was
already
prosecuted
under
federal
law.
but,
of
course,
this
court
has
confronted
exactly
that
argument
in
california
against
zook,
where
you
had
the
statute
of
california
that
prohibited
somebody
operating
as
an
interstate
carrier
without
the
icc
license.
it
was
raised,
you
know,
you
have
to
let
just
the
feds
enforce
that
law.
otherwise,
there
is
a
possibility
of
duplicative
punishment,
duplicative
prosecution.
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument
there.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
i
accepted
justice
kennedy's
characterization
of
the
relevant
language
in
hines.
because
although
there
is
some
general
discussion
there
of
field
preemption,
when
the
court
actually
states
what
its
holding
is,
it
does
state
it
in
terms
of
obstacle
preemption.
and
here's
where
i
think
there
is
a
critical
difference
between
what
the
court
had
before
it
in
hines
and
what
you
have
before
you
here.
in
hines,
pennsylvania
passed
its
statute
before
congress
passed
the
alien
registration
statute.
so
not
surprisingly,
you
know,
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
soothsayers
in
pennsylvania.
they
couldn't
predict
the
future.
so
when
it
got
up
here,
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
provisions
of
the
pennsylvania
registration
law
and
the
federal
registration
law.
and
this
court
struck
it
down
on
that
preemption
basis.
here
it's
quite
different.
arizona
had
before
it
the
federal
statute.
it
looked
at
the
precise
provisions
in
the
federal
statute.
it
adopted
those
standards
as
its
own,
and
then
it
imposed
parallel
penalties
for
the
violation
of
the
state
equivalent.
and
so
i
think
the
right
analysis
is
really
the
analysis
that
this
court
laid
out
in
its
whiting
decision,
which
says
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
what
you
look
for
is
whether
or
not
the
state
scheme
directly
interferes
with
the
operation
of
the
federal
scheme.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
probably
wouldn't
apply.
there's
two
provisions
that
might
make
it
inapplicable.
the
first
question
you'd
ask
is
whether
that
individual
in
that
category
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
1304
and
1306.
and
if
i
understand,
you
know,
the
government's
position,
there
are
certain
people
where,
you
know,
they
can't
really
get
the
registration
document
because
of
the
narrow
class
that
they
are
in.
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
not
a
violation
of
either
1304
or
1306
to
not
get
a
registration
document
when
you're
somebody
who
can't
get
one.
so
you're
not
liable
for
the
willful
failure
to
get
a
registration
document,
and
when
you
don't
have
a
registration
document
to
carry,
you
don't
run
afoul
of
1306
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
that's
not
the
narrow
class
we
were
talking
about.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
you're
in
--
no,
if
you're
in
the
country
lawfully,
i
mean,
you
can
try
to
register.
and
so
somebody
who
enters
illegally
--
i
mean,
they
are
already
guilty
of
one
federal
misdemeanor
by
the
illegal
entry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
at
the
point
that
they
stay
30
days
and
don't
try
to
register,
then
that's
an
independent
violation.
so
maybe
i
need
to
fix
what
i
said
and
say,
look,
if
you're
somebody
who
--
if
you
did
go
to
register,
would
be
told:
you're
fine,
but
we
can't
give
you
a
registration
document,
then
that
individual
is
not
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
federal
statute,
therefore,
wouldn't
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
briefly
with
the
enforcement
issues
and
then
talk
about
the
other
provisions.
the
last
thing
i'll
say
about
the
enforcement
provision,
since
i
do
think
that
the
government's
rather
unusual
theory
that
something
that's
okay
when
done
ad
hoc
becomes
preempted
when
it's
systematic,
i
think
that
theory
largely
refutes
itself.
but
i
will
say
one
thing,
which
is
to
just
echo
that
there
is
no
interference
with
enforcement
priorities
by
simply
giving
the
federal
government
information
on
which
to
bring
their
enforcement
priorities
to
bear.
and
this
is
really
illustrated
by
a
point
this
court
made
in
its
florence
decision
earlier
this
month,
which
is
that
sometimes
you
pull
somebody
over
for
the
most
innocuous
of
infractions
and
they
turn
out
to
be
the
most
serious
of
offenders.
and
so
if
you
preclude
officers,
as
happened
in
phoenix,
from
communicating
with
the
federal
government,
the
federal
government
will
not
be
able
to
identify
the
worst
of
the
worst.
and
if
you
want
an
example
of
this,
look
at
the
declaration
of
officer
brett
glidewell
at
joint
appendix
183
to
186.
he
pulled
somebody
over
in
a
routine
traffic
stop
and
was
shot
by
the
individual.
now,
the
individual
it
turns
out
was
wanted
for
attempted
murder
in
el
salvador
and
was
also
guilty
of
illegal
reentry
into
the
united
states.
he
was
stopped
on
three
previous
occasions
and
his
status
was
not
verified.
now,
if
it
had
been,
he
certainly
would
have
been
apprehended.
in
at
least
two
of
the
stops,
his
immigration
status
wasn't
checked
because
of
the
city
policy,
city
of
phoenix.
now,
if
the
state,
i
submit,
can
do
anything,
it
can
at
the
state
level
override
those
kind
of
local
policies
and
say,
that's
not
what
we
want.
community
policing
is
all
well
and
good,
but
we
want
to
maximize
communication
with
the
federal
authorities.
so
i
think
the
enforcement
policy
and
priorities
argument
simply
doesn't
work.
as
to
section
3,
two
points
about
that.
one
is,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
as
to
whether
the
various
things
that
he
led
off
--
read
off,
the
litany
of
situations
where
somebody
is
--
technically
doesn't
have
registration
would
be
a
violation
of
1306(a).
and
the
reason
i
take
that
position
is
that
provision
says
a
willful
failure
to
register.
now,
maybe
the
prosecutors
take
the
view
that
there
is
willfulness
in
those
circumstances,
but
i
don't
think
many
judges
would.
i
think
they
would
say
that
if
you've
been
told
by
the
federal
government
that
you're
perfectly
fine
here
and
you
don't
need
to
register,
that
that
would
be
good
enough
to
defeat
a
finding
of
willfulness.
so
i
don't
think
1306(a)
covers
this
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
we're
going
to
say
that
we
communicated
with
the
federal
immigration
officials
and
they
told
us
this
is
somebody
who's
perfectly
fine
and
doesn't
have
to
register.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
my
supposition,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
they
would
use
that
call
to
not
bring
the
prosecution,
so
the
issue
wouldn't
even
arise.
but
i
do
want
to
be
clear
about--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
they
bring
a
prosecution
under
section
3--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
they
would
get
it
from
the
federal
authorities.
i
think
it
would
be
admitted.
there
might
be
a
challenge
in
that
case.
i
mean,
you
know,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
address
that
potential
sixth
amendment
issue.
what
i
would
like
to
say
is
two
things.
one,
if
there
is
some
sloppiness
in
the
way
the
federal
government
keeps
its
records
so
that
there's
lots
of
people
that
really
should
be
registered
but
aren't,
i
can't
imagine
that
sloppiness
has
a
preemptive
effect.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
that
i
do
think,
in
thinking
about
section
3
in
particular,
the
analogy
is
not
the
fraud
on
the
fda
claim
in
buckman,
it's
really
the
state
tort
law
that
says
that
it's
a
violation
of
state
tort
law
to
not
even
seek
the
approval
that's
needed
under
the
fda
for
a
device.
now,
states
impose
tort
law
for
people
that
market
a
device
without
getting
the
necessary
approval,
and
nobody
thinks
that's
preempted,
because
it
serves
the
federal
interest.
it
doesn't
have
a
deluge
of
information.
it
forces
people
to
get
fda
approval.
and
in
the
same
way,
this
state
law
will
force
people
to
register,
which
is
what
the
federal
government
is
supposed
to
want
in
the
first
place,
so
there
is
no
preemption
there.
there
is
no
conflict.
as
to
the
employment
provision,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--before
1986,
the
government
was
not
agnostic
about
unlawful
employment
by
aliens.
the
employees
were
already
covered,
and
they
were
subject
to
deportation.
so
the
government
said,
we're
going
to
cover
the
employers
for
the
first
time.
i
can't
imagine
why
that
would
have
preemptive
effect.
thank
you,
your
honor.
