mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we're
not
making
any
allegation
about
racial
or
ethnic
profiling
in
the
case.
mr.
clement
is
working
hard
this
morning
to
portray
sb
1070
as
an
aid
to
federal
immigration
enforcement.
but
the
very
first
provision
of
the
statute
declares
that
arizona
is
pursuing
its
own
policy
of
attrition
through
enforcement
and
that
the
provisions
of
this
law
are
designed
to
work
together
to
drive
unlawfully
present
aliens
out
of
the
state.
that
is
something
arizona
cannot
do
because
the
constitution
vests
exclusive--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
because
the
constitution
vests
exclusive
authority
over
immigration
matters
with
the
national
government.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
the
framers
vested
in
the
national
government
the
authority
over
immigration
because
they
understood
that
the
way
this
nation
treats
citizens
of
other
countries
is
a
vital
aspect
of
our
foreign
relations.
the
national
government,
and
not
an
individual
state--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
they
cannot
do
what
arizona
is
seeking
to
do
here,
your
honor,
which
is
to
elevate
one
consideration
above
all
others.
arizona
is
pursuing
a
policy
that
maximizes
the
apprehension
of
unlawfully
present
aliens
so
they
can
be
jailed
as
criminals
in
arizona
unless
the
federal
government
agrees
to
direct
its
enforcement
resources
to
remove
the
people
that
arizona
has
identified.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
mandatory
character
of
the
arizona
law
and
the
mandatory
character
of
the
obligations
it
imposes,
especially
as
backed
by
this
extraordinary
provision
in
section
2(h),
which
imposes
civil
penalties
of
up
to
$5000
a
day
on
any
official
in
the
state
of
arizona
who
is
not
following
section
2
or,
as
we
read
it,
the
rest
of
s.b.
1070,
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
does
create
a
conflict.
but
i
do
think
the
most
fundamental
point
about
section
2
is
to
understand
its
relationship
to
the
other
provisions
in
the
statute.
section
2
is
in
the
statute
to
identify
the
class
of
people
who
arizona
is
then
committed
to
prosecute
under
section
3
and,
if
they
are
employed,
also
under
section
5.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
still
a
problem,
your
honor.
these
decisions
have
to
be
made
at
the
national
level
because
it's
the
national
government
and
not
--
it's
the
whole
country
and
not
an
individual
state
that
pays
the
price--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
we
should
think
about
section
3
of
the
law,
your
honor.
i
think
it
will
help
illustrate
the
point--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
the
preemption
here
--
focusing
for
a
moment
on
section
3
--
the
preemption
here
flows
from
judgments
of
congress,
from
the
registration
system
that
congress
set
up
in
sections
1301
through
1306,
from
the
decision
of
congress
in
section
1103
in
the
law
to
vest
the
secretary
of
dhs
and
the
attorney
general
with
the
authority
to
make
the
judgments
about
how
this
law
is
going
to
be
enforced--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
can
make
--
they
can
engage
in
detention
in
support
of
the
enforcement
of
federal
law.
that's
what
the
olc
opinion
from
2002
says.
it
does
not
say
that
they
can
prosecute
under
federal
law
and
make
their
own
decisions.
that's
a
far
different
matter.
and
it
really
goes
to
the
heart,
i
think,
of
what's
wrong
with
section
of
this
act,
in
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct,
but
with
respect
to
--
and
let
me
address
something
fundamental
about
section
2.
that
is
true,
but
i
think
it
doesn't
get
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
here.
section
1
of
this
statute
says
that
sections
2
and
3
and
5
are
supposed
to
work
together
to
achieve
this
policy
of
attrition
through
enforcement.
and
so
what
section
2
does
is
identify
a
population
that
the
state
of
arizona
is
going
to
prosecute
under
section
3
and
section
5.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor;
but,
before
i
take
3
and
5
off
the
table,
if
i
could
make
one
more
point
about
3
and
5,
please.
the
--
i
think
--
because
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
dilemma
that
this
puts
the
federal
government
in.
arizona
has
got
this
population,
and
they've
--
and
they're
by
law
committed
to
maximum
enforcement.
and
so
the
federal
government's
got
to
decide,
are
we
going
to
take
our
resources,
which
we
deploy
for
removal,
and
are
we
going
to
use
them
to
deal
with
this
population,
even
if
it
is
to
the
detriment
of
our
priorities--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--here's
the
other
half
--
here's
the
other
half
of
the
equation,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
that
they
say
if
you're
not
going
to
remove
them,
we
are
going
to
prosecute
them.
and
that
means
that
the
--
and
i
think
this
does
get
at
the
heart
of
why
this
needs
to
be
an
exclusive
national
power--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
but
those
are
--
but
what
you're
talking
about
is
taking
somebody
whose
only
offense
is
being
unlawfully
present
in
the
country
and
putting
them
in
jail
for
up
to
6
months,
or
somebody
who--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--or
like
30
days,
forgive
me;
6
months
for
employment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we're
not
saying
the
state
can't
ask
it
in
any
individual
case.
we
recognize
that
section--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
certainly,
but
that
doesn't
make--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
--
i
think
the
problem
here
is
in
that
--
is
in
every
circumstance
as
a
result
of
section
2(b)
of
the
law,
backed
by
the
penalties
of
section
2(h),
the
state
official
must
pursue
the
priorities
that
the
state
has
set,
irrespective
of
whether
they
are
helpful
to
or
in
conflict
with
the
federal
priorities.
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
it
wouldn't
be,
your
honor,
because
in
that
situation
they
would
be
free
to
be
responsive
to
federal
priorities,
if
the
federal
officials
came
back
to
them
and
said,
look,
we
need
to
focus
on
gangs,
we
need
to
focus
on
this
drug
problem
at
the
border--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
there's
a
--
if
there's
a
state
policy
locked
into
law
by
statute,
locked
into
law
by
regulation,
then
we
have
a
problem.
if
it's
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
mean,
the
line
is
mandatory
versus
discretionary--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
they
--
but
with
respect
to
immigration
enforcement,
and
to
the
extent
all
they're
doing
is
bringing
people
to
the
federal
government's
attention,
they
are
cooperating
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
law--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
except
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
is
that
it's
not
cooperation
if
in
every
instance
the
officers
in
the
state
must
respond
to
the
priorities
set
by
the
state
government
and
are
not
free
to
respond
to
the
priorities
of
the
federal
officials
who
are
trying
to
enforce
the
law
in
the
most
effective
manner
possible.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
there
are
three.
the
first
is
the
--
the
hines
problem
of
harassment.
now,
we
are
not
making
an
allegation
of
racial
profiling;
nevertheless,
there
are
already
tens
of
thousands
of
stops
that
result
in
inquiries
in
arizona,
even
in
the
absence
of
s.b.
1070.
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
legislature
thought
that
that
wasn't
sufficient
and
there
needed
to
be
more.
and
given
that
you
have
a
population
in
arizona
of
2
million
latinos,
of
whom
only
400,000
at
most
are
there
unlawfully--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
they're
--
and
given
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
status
of
being
unlawfully
present--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor.
it's
the
--
the
palmatier
declaration,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
was
the
--
he
was
the
fellow
who
used
the
run
the
law
enforcement
support
center,
which
answers
the
inquiries.
that
--
that
declaration
indicates
that
in
fiscal
year
2009,
there
were
80,000
inquiries
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
other
--
and
other
people
lawfully
present
in
the
country,
certainly,
but
this
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--hines
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--hines
identified
this
problem
as
harassment
as
--
as
a
central
feature
of
preemption
under
the
immigration
laws
because
of
the
concern
that
the
way
this
nation
treats
citizens
of
other
countries
is
fundamental
to
our
foreign
relations.
and
this
is
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
we
would
think
it
would
ameliorate--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
would
ameliorate
the
practical
problem;
but,
there
is
still
a
structural
problem
here
in
that
this
is
an
effort
to
enforce
federal
law.
and
the
--
under
the
constitution,
it's
the
president
and
the
executive
branch
that
are
responsible
for
the
enforcement
of
federal
law--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
the
process
of
--
the
process
of
cooperating
to
enforce
the
federal
immigration
law
starts
earlier,
and
it
starts
with
the
process
of
making
the
decisions
about
who
to
--
who
to
stop,
who
to
apprehend,
who
to
check
on.
and
the
problem
--
the
structural
problem
we
have
is
that
those
decisions
--
in
the
making
of
those
decisions,
arizona
officials
are
not
free--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
we
want
to
be
able
to
cooperate
and
focus
on
our
priorities.
and
one
thing
that's
instructive
in
that
regard,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
the
declarations
put
into
the
record
by
the
police
chiefs
from
phoenix
and
tucson,
both
of
whom
i
think
explain
effectively
why
s.b.
--
the
section
2(b)
obligation
gets
in
the
way
of
the
mutual
effort
to
--
to
focus
on
the
priorities
of
identifying
serious
criminals
so
that
they
can
be
removed
from
the
country.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it
could,
but
i
think
that's
quite--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
no
one
would--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--of
course
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
this
argument
is
quite
different,
justice
scalia,
because
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
that
federal
registration
requirement
in
an
area
of
dominant
federal
concern,
exclusive
federal
concern
with
respect
to
immigration,
who
can
be
in
the
country,
under
what
circumstances,
and
what
obligations
they
have--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
about
section
3.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
in
any
individual
case,
that's
correct.
you
--
you
would
need
to
make
the
inquiry
in
the
first
place.
it
won't
always
be
correct,
if
you're
arresting
somebody
based
on
probable
cause
that
they
have
committed
a
serious
crime,
and
they
--
and
they
--
the
inquiry
into
whether
--
into
their
status
will
be
enough
to
identify
that
person
for
priority--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
correct
that
you
can't,
but
there
is
a
--
there
is
difference,
justice
alito,
i
think,
between
the
question
of
any
individual
circumstance
and
a
mandatory
policy
backed
by
this
civil
fine,
that
you've
got
to
make
the
inquiry
in
every
case.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
as
though,
if
i
can
use
an
analogy,
if
you
ask
one
of
your
law
clerks
to
bring
you
the
most
important
preemption
cases
from
the
last
10
years,
and
they
rolled
in
the
last
--
the
last
hundred
volumes
of
the
u.s.
reports
and
said,
well,
they
are
in
there.
that
--
that
doesn't
make
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
understand
the
question.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
this:
1373
was
enacted
in
1996,
along
with
1357.
and
1357
is
the
provision
that
sets
forth
the
powers
and
authorities
of
federal
immigration
officials.
it
contains
1357(g),
which
effectively
says
that
federal
--
that
the
federal
government,
the
attorney
general,
can
deputize
state
officials,
so
long
as
they're
--
they
obtain
adequate
training
and
they
are
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
attorney
general
in
carrying
out
immigration
functions.
then
the
last
provision,
(g)(10),
says
that
nothing
that
we've
said
so
far
should
be
read
to
preclude
informal
cooperation,
communication
or
other
informal
cooperation
in
the
apprehension,
detention
and
removal
of
unlawfully
present
persons;
but,
it's
the
focus
on
cooperation.
and
i
think
you
have
to
--
so
i
don't
think
you
can
read
into
1373
the
--
the
conclusion
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
was
to
shift
from
the
federal
government
to
the
states
the
authority
to
set
enforcement
priorities,
because
i
think
the
cooperation
in
this
context
is
cooperation
in
the
service
of
the
federal
enforcement.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so
let
me
just
summarize
what
i
think
the
three
are,
and
then
maybe
i
can
move
on
to
sections
3
and
5.
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
2,
we
think
the
harassment
argument
--
we
think
this
is
a
more
significant
harassment
problem
than
was
present
in
hines--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
respect
to
--
in
addition,
we
do
think
that
there
is
a
structural
accountability
problem
in
that
they
are
enforcing
federal
law
but
not
answerable
to
the
federal
officials.
and
third,
we
do
think
there
are
practical
impediments,
in
that
the
--
the
result
of
this
is
to
deliver
to
the
federal
system
a
volume
of
inquiries
that
makes
it
harder
and
not
easier
to
identify
who
the
priority
persons
are
for
removal.
so
those
are
the
three
reasons.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
i
do
think
the
key
thing
about
section
3
is
that
we
--
is
that
section
3
is
purporting
to
enforce
a
federal
registration
requirement.
that's
a
relationship
between
the
alien
and
the
united
states
government
that's
exclusively
a
federal
relationship.
it's
governed
by
the
terms
of
1301
through
1306.
and
the
way
in
which
those
terms
are
enforced
does
have
very
significant
federal
interest
at
its
heart,
and
there
is
no
state
police
power
interest
in
that
federal
registration
relationship.
and
i
do
think
--
i
think
it's
very
important
--
justice
alito
raised
the
question
of
these
categories
of
people.
i
think
it
is
quite
important
to
get
clarity
on
that.
the
--
if
you
are
--
if
you
have
come
into
the
country
unlawfully,
but
you
have
a
pending
application
for
asylum,
a
pending
application
for
temporary
protective
status
because
you
would
have
to
be
removed
to
a
country
to
which
you
can't
be
removed
because
of
the
conditions
in
the
country,
if
you
have
a
valid
claim
for
relief
under
the
violence
against
women
act
based
on
your
treatment,
if
you
have
a
valid
claim
for
relief
because
you
are
a
victim
of
human
trafficking,
if
you
have
a
valid
claim
for
relief
because
you
are
the
victim
of
a
crime
or
a
witness
to
a
crime,
all
of
those
persons
are
in
technical
violation
of
1306(a).
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
they
--
they
are
in
violation
of
1306(a),
so
my
friend,
mr.
clement,
is
not
correct
in
saying
that
those
are
people
who
aren't
in
violation
of
1306(a)
and,
therefore,
aren't
in
violation
of
section
3.
they
are
in
violation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
it's
a
situation
in
which
no
reasonable
person
would
think
that
the
individual
ought
to
be
prosecuted;
and,
yet,
very
often,
the
states
aren't
even
going
to
know.
in
fact,
about
asylum
status,
they
can't
know
because
there
are
regulations
that
require
that
to
be
kept
private
to
avoid
retaliation
against
the
person
making
the
application.
and
so,
this
is
--
so
this
is
--
this
is,
i
think,
a
very
strong
illustration
of
why
the
enforcement
discretion
over
section
3
needs
to
be
vested
exclusively
in
the
federal
government.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
this
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
what
is
extraordinary
about
this,
actually,
justice
scalia,
is
the
state's
decision
to
enact
a
statute
purporting
to
criminalize
the
violation
of
a
federal
registration
obligation.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem
here.
and
they
are
doing
it
for
a
reason--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
--
but
what--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it's
quite
different.
what
they
are
doing
here
is
using
1306(a)
to
get
at
the
status
of
unlawful
presence.
the
only
people
who
can
be
prosecuted
under
section
3
are
people
who
are
unlawfully
present
in
the
country.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
and
they
are
using
it
to
get
at
that
category
of
people
to
essentially
use
their
state
criminal
law
to
perform
an
immigration
function.
and
the
immigration
function
is
to
try
to
--
to
prosecute
these
people.
and,
by
the
way,
you
can
prosecute
somebody,
they
can
be
put
in
jail
for
30
days
here;
but,
under
federal
law,
a
violation
of
1306(a)
is
a
continuing
offense.
so,
the
day
they
get
out
of
jail
for
that
30
days,
they
can
be
arrested
again,
and
this
can
happen
over
and
over
again.
and
the
point
of
this
provision
is
to
drive
unlawfully
present
people
out
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
of
course,
they
have
legitimate
concerns
in
that
situation.
and,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
--
they
certainly
can
enact
laws
of
general
application.
they
can
enforce
the
laws
of
general
application
that
are
on
the
books.
they
already
--
as
a
result
of
8
u.s.c.
1621,
it's
clear
that
they
are
under
no
obligation
to
provide
any
state
benefits
to
the
population.
but
i
think,
most
importantly,
they
can
--
and
--
not
most
importantly,
but
as
importantly,
they
can
engage
in
cooperative
efforts
with
the
federal
government--
excuse
me.
i
see
my--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--they
can
--
they
can
engage
in
cooperative
efforts
with
the
federal
government,
of
which
there
are
many
going
on
in
arizona
and
around
the
country,
in
order
to
address
these
problems.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
of
course,
we
have
to
set
priorities.
there
are
only--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
what
i
think
they
are
going
to
do
in
arizona
is
something
quite
extraordinary,
that
has
significant
real
and
practical
foreign
relations
effects.
and
that's
the
problem,
and
it's
the
reason
why
this
power
needs
to
be
vested
exclusively
in
the
federal
government.
what
they
are
going
to
do
is
engage,
effectively,
in
mass
incarceration,
because
the
obligation
under
section
2(h),
of
course,
is
not
merely
to
enforce
section
2
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
at
the
--
at
the
risk
of
civil
fine,
but
to
enforce
federal
immigration
law,
which
is
what
they
claim
they
are
doing
in
section
3
and
in
section
5.
and
so
--
so,
you're
going
to
have
a
situation
of
mass
incarceration
of
people
who
are
unlawfully
present.
that
is
going
to
raise
--
poses
a
very
serious
risk
of
raising
significant
foreign
relations
problems.
and
these
problems
are
real.
it
is
the
problem
of
reciprocal
treatment
of
the
united
states
citizens
in
other
countries.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
we
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
enforcing
the
law,
of
course,
but
it
needs
to
be
--
but
these
--
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
has
recognized
that
the
--
the
balance
of
interest
that
has
to
be
achieved
in
enforcing
the
--
the
immigration
laws
is
exceedingly
delicate
and
complex,
and
it
involves
consideration
of
foreign
relations,
it
involves
humanitarian
concerns,
and
it
also
involves
public
order
and
public--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
assume
so,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
they
--
i
mean,
it
can
come
in
lots
of
different
ways,
but
generally
they
will
get
a
name
and
some
other
identifying
information.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
so
the
way
this
works
is
there
is
a
system
for
--
for
incoming
inquiries.
and
then
there
is
a
person
at
a
computer
terminal.
and
that
person
searches
a
number
of
different
databases.
there
are
eight
or
ten
different
databases,
and
that
person
will
check
the
name
against
this
one,
check
the
name
against
that
one,
check
the
name
against
the
other
one,
to
see
if
there
are
any
hits.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
citizen
problem
is
actually
a
significant
problem.
there
isn't
a
citizen
database.
if
you--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
not.
if
you
have
a
passport,
there
is
a
database
if
you
look
"passports".
so
you
could
be
discovered
that
way.
but
otherwise
there
is
no
reliable
way
in
the
database
to
verify
that
you
are
a
citizen
unless
you
are
in
the
passport
database.
so
you
have
lots
of
circumstances
in
which
people
who
are
citizens
are
going
to
come
up
no
match.
there's
no
--
there
is
nothing
suggesting
in
the
databases
that
they
have
an
immigration
problem
of
any
kind,
but
there's
nothing
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--while
i'm
at
it,
there
is
a
factual
point
i
think
i'd
like
to
correct.
mr.
clement
suggested
that
it
takes
10
minutes
to
process
these
calls.
that's
true,
but
you're
in
a
queue
for
60
minutes
before
it
takes
the
10
minutes
to
process
the
call.
so
the
average
time
is
70
minutes,
not
10
minutes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
i
think
the
point
is
this,
that
with
respect
to
persons
who
are
unlawfully
present,
there
are
some
who
are
going
to
fall
in
our
priority
categories,
there
are
those
who
have
committed
serious
offenses,
there
are
those
who
have
been
removed
and
have
come
back,
and
there
are
other
priority
categories.
because
we
have
resource
constraints
and
there
are
only
so
many
beds
in
the
detention
centers
and
only
so
many
immigration
judges,
we
want
to
focus
on
those
priority
categories,
find
them,
remove
them.
there
is
a
second
category,
and
that
is,
individuals
who
are
here
in
violation
technically
of
1306(a),
but
who
have
a
valid
asylum
application
or
application
for
temporary
protected
status
or
other
--
and
with
respect
to
those
persons
that
we
think
would
--
it's
affirmatively
harmful
to
think
that
they
ought
to
be
prosecuted.
and
then
there
is
an
additional
category
of
people
who
are
not
in
the
second
category
and
not
priorities
and
the
form
--
and
we
think
there,
the
idea
that
an
individual
state
will
engage
in
a
process
of
mass
incarceration
of
that
population,
which
we
do
think
is
what
section
2(h)
commits
arizona
to
do
under
section
3,
raises
a
significant
foreign
relations
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
really
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--this
is
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
a
couple
of
things.
first
is,
i
don't
think
it's
realistic
to
assume
that
the
aggressive
enforcement
of
sections
3
and
5
in
arizona
is
going
to
lead
to
a
mass
migration
back
to
countries
of
origin.
it
seems
a
far
more
likely
outcome
is
going
to
be
migration
to
other
states.
and
that's
a
significant
problem.
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
this
problem
needs
to
be
managed
on
a
national
basis.
beyond
that,
i
do
think,
you
know,
the
--
it's
worth
bearing
in
mind
here
that
the
country
of
mexico
is
in
a
central
role
in
this
situation.
between
60
and
70
percent
of
the
people
that
we
remove
every
year,
we
remove
to
mexico.
and
in
addition,
we
have
to
have
the
cooperation
of
the
mexicans.
and
i
think
as
the
court
knows
from
other
cases,
the
cooperation
of
the
country
to
whom
we
are
--
to
which
we
are
removing
people
who
are
unlawfully
present
is
vital
to
be
able
to
make
removal
work.
in
addition,
we
have
very
significant
issues
on
the
border
with
mexico.
and
in
fact,
they
are
the
very
issues
that
arizona
is
complaining
about
in
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
but
what
it
does
--
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
points
up
why
the
framers
made
this
power
an
exclusive
national
power.
it's
because
the
entire
country
feels
the
effects
of
a
decision
--
conduct
by
an
individual
state.
and
that's
why
the
power
needs
to
be
exercised
at
the
national
level
and
not
the
state
level.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right,
but
the
problem
i'm
focused
on
--
we're
focused
on,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
our
removal
decisions,
but
arizona's
decision
to
incarcerate,
and
the
foreign
relations
problem
that
that
raises.
that's
why
this
power
has
got
to
be
exercised
at
the
national
level.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
2
identifies
the
population
that's
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
3
and
5.
i
haven't
--
i've
been
up
here
a
long
time.
i
haven't
said
anything
about
section
5
yet.
and
i
don't
want
to
tax
the
court's
patience,
but
if
i
could
spend
a
minute
on
section
5.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
--
i
do
think
the
fundamental
point
about
section
5
here
is
that
in
1986,
congress
fundamentally
changed
the
landscape.
congress
made
a
decision
in
1986
to
make
the
employment
of
aliens
a
central
concern
of
national
immigration
policy.
and
this
court
has
described
the
1986
law
as
a
comprehensive
regime.
now,
what
my
friend,
mr.
clement,
says,
is
that
it
may
be
a
comprehensive
regime
for
employers;
it's
not
a
comprehensive
regime
for
employees.
and
therefore,
it's
--
there
ought
not
be
any
inference
here
that
the
states
are
precluded
from
criminalizing
efforts
to
seek
or
obtain
employment
in
arizona.
but
i
really
think
that's
not
right.
the
--
employment
is
one
problem.
and
congress
tackled
the
problem
of
employment
and
made
a
decision,
a
comprehensive
decision,
about
the
sanctions
it
thought
were
appropriate
to
govern.
and
congress
did,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
make
judgments
with
respect
to
the
circumstances
under
which
employees
could
be
held
criminally
liable,
as
well
as
the
circumstances
under
which
employers
could
be
held
liable.
and
i
think
it
is
useful
in
thinking
about
the
judgments
congress
actually
made--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
both.
i
think
we're
making
both
a
field
and
a
conflict
preemption
argument
here,
justice
scalia.
and
the
--
i
think
it's
worth
examining
the
specific
judgments
congress
made
in
1986.
on
the
employer's
side
--
and,
after
all,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
concern
here
is
that
the
employer
is
in
a
position
of
being
the
exploiter
and
the
alien
of
being
the
exploited
--
on
the
employer's
side,
congress
said
that
states
may
not
impose
criminal
sanctions,
and
even
--
and
the
federal
government
will
not
impose
criminal
sanctions
for
the
hiring
of
employees
unless
there's
a
pattern
or
practice.
it
seems
quite
incongruous
to
think
that
congress,
having
made
that
judgment
and
imposed
those
restrictions
on
the
employer's
side,
would
have
left
states
free
to
impose
criminal
liability
on
employees
merely
for
seeking
work,
for
doing
what
you
i
think
would
expect
most
otherwise
law-abiding
people
to
do,
which
is
to
find
a
job
so
they
can
feed
their
families.
so
i
think
that's
a
significant
problem.
in
addition,
congress
made
clear
in
the
law
that
the
i-9
form
could
not
be
used
for
any
other
purpose
than
prosecutions
for
violation
of
the
federal
antifraud
requirements.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
leave
states
free
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
on
employees
for
seeking
work,
they
wouldn't
have
done
that,
it
seems
to
me.
so
that
i
think
there
are
strong
indicators
in
the
text
that
congress
did
make
a
judgment,
and
the
judgment
was
this
far
and
no
farther.
and
it's
reasonable
that
congress
would
have
done
so,
for
the
same
kinds
of
foreign
relations
concerns
that
i
was
discussing
with
respect
to
section
3.
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
thing
to
put
someone
in
jail
merely
for
seeking
work.
and
yet
that's
what
arizona
proposes
to
do
under
section
5
of
its
law.
now,
of
course,
there
is
an
express
preemption
provision,
but
the
express
preemption
provision,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
does
not
operate
to
the
exclusion
of
implied
preemption,
field
or
conflict.
so
we
do
think
those
principles
apply
here.
we
think
there's
a
reason
why
the
express
preemption
provision
was
limited
to
the
employer's
side,
which
is
that
after
decanas
laws
had
been
enacted
on
the
employer's
side,
and
with
--
congress
was
making
clear
that
those
were
preemptive,
there
were
no
laws
on
the
employee's
side
at
the
time.
and
therefore,
no
reason
for
preemption.
