chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-182,
arizona
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
maybe
it's
a
good
time
to
talk
about
some
of
the
other
sections,
in
particular
section
5(c).
now,
that
does
seem
to
expand
beyond
the
federal
government's
determination
about
the
types
of
sanctions
that
should
govern
the
employment
relationship.
you
talk
about
supply
and
demand.
the
federal
government,
of
course,
prohibits
the
employment,
but
it
also
imposes
sanctions
with
respect
to
application
for
work.
and
the
state
of
arizona,
in
this
case,
is
imposing
some
significantly
greater
sanctions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
give
you
plenty
of
rebuttal
time,
but
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
section
3
before
you
sit
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
clement.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
into
what
the
case
is
about,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
at
the
outset
what
it's
not
about.
no
part
of
your
argument
has
to
do
with
racial
or
ethnic
profiling,
does
it?
i
saw
none
of
that
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
this
is
not
a
case
about
ethnic
profiling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
that
state
does
--
well,
that's
a
question
of
enforcement
priorities.
well,
let's
say
that
the
government
had
a
different
set
of
enforcement
priorities,
and
their
objective
was
to
protect
to
the
maximum
extent
possible
the
borders;
and,
so
anyone
who
is
here
illegally,
they
want
to
know
about
and
they
want
to
do
something
about,
in
other
words,
different
than
the
current
policy.
does
that
mean
in
that
situation
the
arizona
law
would
not
be
preemptive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
say
that
the
federal
government
has
to
have
control
over
who
to
prosecute,
but
i
don't
see
how
section
2(b)
says
anything
about
that
at
all.
all
it
does
is
notify
the
federal
government,
here's
someone
who
is
here
illegally,
here's
someone
who
is
removable.
the
discretion
to
prosecute
for
federal
immigration
offenses
rests
entirely
with
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
apart
from
section
3
and
section
5,
take
those
off
the
table,
you
have
no
objection
to
section
2.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
the
federal
government
has
to
decide
where
it's
going
to
use
its
resources.
and
what
the
state
is
saying,
here
are
people
who
are
here
in
violation
of
federal
law,
you
make
the
decision.
and
if
your
decision
is
you
don't
want
to
prosecute
those
people,
fine,
that's
entirely
up
to
you.
that's
why
i
don't
see
the
problem
with
section
2(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
only
under
section
3
and
section
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
say
you're
worried
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
you
go.
right.
for
the
notification,
what
could
possibly
be
wrong
if
arizona
arrests
someone,
let's
say
for
drunk
driving,
and
their
policy
is
you're
going
to
stay
in
jail
overnight
no
matter
what,
okay,
what's
wrong
during
that
period
by
having
the
arizona
arresting
officer
say,
i'm
going
to
call
the
federal
agency
and
find
out
if
this
person
is
here
illegally,
because
the
federal
law
says
the
federal
agency
has
to
answer
my
question?
it
seems
an
odd
argument
to
say
the
federal
agency
has
to
answer
the
state's
question,
but
the
state
can't
ask
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
there
are
individual
cases
in
which
the
state
can
call
the
federal
government
and
say:
is
this
person
here
illegally?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
doesn't
that
defeat
the
facial
challenge
to
the
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
is
not
an
effort
to
enforce
federal
law.
it
is
an
effort
to
let
you
know
about
violations
of
federal
law.
whether
or
not
to
enforce
them
is
still
entirely
up
to
you.
if
you
don't
want
to
do
this,
you
just
tell
the
person
at
lesc
--
if
that's
the
right
--
is
that
the
right
acronym?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--lesc,
look,
when
somebody
from
arizona
calls,
answer
their
question,
and
don't
even
bother
to
write
it
down.
okay?
i
stopped
somebody
else,
is
he
legal
or
illegal,
let
me
check
--
it's,
oh,
he's
illegal.
okay,
thanks,
good-bye.
i
mean,
why
--
it
is
still
your
decision.
and
if
you
don't
want
to
know
who
is
in
this
country
illegally,
you
don't
have
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
2(b),
the
person
is
already
stopped
for
some
other
reason.
he's
stopped
for
going
60
in
a
20.
he's
stopped
for
drunk
driving.
so
that
decision
to
stop
the
individual
has
nothing
to
do
with
immigration
law
at
all.
all
that
has
to
do
with
immigration
law
is
the
--
whether
or
not
they
can
ask
the
federal
government
to
find
out
if
this
person
is
illegal
or
not,
and
then
leave
it
up
to
you.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
government
just
doesn't
want
to
know
who
is
here
illegally
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
they
just
rolled
in
whiting?
[laughter]
that's
a
pretty
good
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
you
have
been
trying
valiantly
to
get
us
to
focus
on
section
3,
so
maybe
we
should
let
you
do
that
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
keep
going.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
had
a
little
--
wasn't
sure
about
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
is
the
reason
that
the
government
is
not
focused
on
people
who
are
here
illegally
as
opposed
to
the
other
categories
we
were
talking
about
because
of
prioritization
or
because
of
lack
of
resources?
you
suggested
that
if
the
--
every
illegal
alien
that
you
identify
is
either
removed
or
prosecuted,
that
that
would
cause
tensions
with
other
governments.
so
i
--
i
don't
understand
if
it's
because
you
don't
have
enough
resources
or
because
you
don't
want
to
prosecute
the
people
who
are
simply
here
illegally
as
opposed
to
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
concern
is
the
problems
that
would
arise
in
bilateral
relations
if
you
remove
all
of
these
people,
or
a
significant
percentage
or
a
greater
percentage
than
you
are
now.
nothing
in
the
law
requires
you
to
do
that.
all
it
does
is
lets
you
know
where
--
that
an
illegal
alien
has
been
arrested,
and
you
can
decide,
we
are
not
going
to
initiate
removal
proceedings
against
that
individual.
it
doesn't
require
you
to
remove
one
more
person
than
you
would
like
to
remove
under
your
priorities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
arises
under
3
and
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
2.
chief
justice
john
g.

section
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
clement,
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement,
general
verrilli.
well
argued
on
both
sides.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
11-182,
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion.
the
case
is
arizona
versus
united
states.
