justice
elena
kagan
ms.
kruger,
you
take
a
statute
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
imputation
one
way
or
the
other,
and
you
say
that
statute
can
still
be
unambiguous;
and
that
would
i
think
be
true
as
a
general
matter.
but
now
you
add
to
that
statute
a
history
and
a
tradition
and
a
practice
in
immigration
law
of
imputation
of
various
kinds.
one
is
imputation
of
domicile
in
the
way
we
talked
about,
but
there
are
other
imputations
that
occur
throughout
the
field
of
immigration
law.
some
cut
for
the
alien,
some
cut
against
the
alien.
in
the
world
of
that
practice
and
tradition,
are
you
at
least
in
a
sphere
in
which
there
is
ambiguity,
in
which
the
agency
essentially
has
discretion
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
impute
in
this
way?
justice
elena
kagan
but
none
of
them
are
textually
commanded,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
they
are
all
situations
in
which
the
agency
has
decided
that
there
are
good
reasons
to
impute
various
factors.
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
think
that
all
the
imputations
that
exist
in
immigration
law
are
all
a
matter
of
imputing
intent?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kinnaird,
i
take
it
that
the
point
you
are
making
is
the
statute
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
that
its
silence
does
not
prevent
the
bia
from
making
this
imputation
if
it
wants
to.
but
the
bia
clearly
doesn't
want
to.
so
where
does
that
leave
you?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
bia
needs
to
write
an
opinion
that
says,
now
we
are
doing
chevron
step
two
analysis?
is
that
what
you
are
saying,
that
this
is
a
matter
of
labeling?
justice
elena
kagan
these
cases
concern
the
reasonableness
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
or
bia's
interpretation
of
a
federal
immigration
statute,
which
i'll
refer
to
as
section
1229
(b)
(a).
that
statute
gives
the
attorney
general
discretion
to
allow
otherwise
removable
aliens,
usually
aliens
who
have
committed
a
crime,
to
stay
in
the
country
so
long
as
they
satisfy
certain
criteria,
two
of
which
are
relevant
here.
first,
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute
requires
the
alien
to
have
held
the
status
of
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
in
immigration
lingo
that's
called
lpr
status,
for
at
least
five
years.
second,
subsection
(a)
(2)
requires
the
alien
to
have
continuously
resided
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
seven
years
after
being
lawfully
admitted,
whatever
his
immigration
status
is.
now,
there's
a
question
about
applying
this
statute
to
aliens
who
have
lived
in
the
country
as
children.
sometimes
a
child
will
enter
the
country
lawfully
or
obtain
lpr
status
after
one
of
his
parents
does.
in
those
situations,
a
parent
might
qualify
for
relief
under
the
statute
while
his
child,
considered
independently,
does
not.
so
the
question
arises,
should
the
bia
require
each
alien
to
meet
1229
(b)
(a)'s
requirements
on
his
own
or
should
it
impute
a
parent's
years
of
lpr
status
or
residence
to
his
child.
the
cases
before
us
illustrate
how
the
issue
comes
up.
there
are
two
of
them,
but
i
will
give
you
the
facts
of
just
one
as
an
example.
carlos
martinez
gutierrez
entered
the
country
illegally
with
his
family
in
1989
when
he
was
five
years
old.
his
father
was
lawfully
admitted
as
an
lpr
just
two
years
later.
but
martinez
gutierrez
was
neither
lawfully
admitted
nor
given
lpr
status
until
2003,
so
when
martinez
gutierrez
committed
a
crime
two
years
later
in
2005,
and
that
--
and
that
crime
rendered
him
removable,
he
couldn't
satisfy
either
subsection
of
1229
(b)
(a)
without
help
from
his
father.
the
bia
has
held
that
aliens,
like
martinez
gutierrez,
are
out
of
luck.
it
is
required
each
alien
to
independently
satisfy
1229
(b)
(a).
children
don't
get
to
borrow
years
of
residence
or
immigration
status
from
their
parents,
but
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
this
position
was
unreasonable
and
held
that
the
board
must
impute
a
parent's
immigration
history
to
his
or
her
child
for
any
years
in
which
the
child
lived
with
the
parent
as
an
unemancipated
minor.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
this
question
to
determine
whether
the
bia's
no
imputation
policy
is
based
on
a
reasonable
construction
of
1229
(b)
(a).
the
construction
need
only
be
reasonable,
it
need
not
be
the
only
construction
or
even
the
best
one
because
we
give
deference
to
agencies
when
they
interpret
the
statutes
they
administer
and
today,
we
hold
that
the
bia's
interpretation
of
1229
(b)
(a)
is
reasonable.
the
board's
position
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
which
doesn't
mention
much
less
require
imputation.
instead,
the
statute
simply
calls
for
the
alien
to
meet
the
prerequisites
for
relief.
gutierrez
contends
that
this
language
doesn't
foreclose
imputation,
but
even
if
that's
true,
that
is
not
enough
to
require
the
board
to
adopt
the
policy
and
that
so
of
a
number
of
martinez
gutierrez's
arguments.
he
has
presented
a
variety
of
reasons
why
the
board
might
read
the
statutes
to
permit
imputation,
but
none
requiring
the
board
to
do
so.
we
also
reject
gutierrez's
argument
that
the
bia's
policy
should
be
struck
down
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
decision
to
allow
imputation
between
parents
and
children
in
other
immigration
contexts.
we
think
the
bia
has
done
an
adequate
job
of
explaining
why
imputation
might
make
sense
in
some
areas
but
not
in
others.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
