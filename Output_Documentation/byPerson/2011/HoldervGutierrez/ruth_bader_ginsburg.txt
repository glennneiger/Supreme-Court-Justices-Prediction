what
about,
there
was
--
wasn't
there
in
the
prior
law
a
child
domicile
--
a
child
was
able
to
satisfy
the
7-year
requirement
based
on
the
parent's
domicile,
which
was
deemed
to
be
the
child's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
--
does
a
child
who
is
not
emancipated
have
the
capacity
to
independently
establish
a
residence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
supposition
--
if
the
supposition
is
that
the
parents
--
i
think
justice
breyer's
supposition
was
that
both
parents
were
lprs.
the
likelihood
of
a
6-month-old
child
being
born
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
being
a
citizen
would
be
rather
large.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
do
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
--
your
argument,
under
your
argument
an
alien,
a
child
who
would
never
acquired
lpr
status
in
its
own
right,
could
get
a
cancellation
of
removal
based
on
the
parents'
status.
justice
ruth
bader

there
--
this
court
has
dealt
in
the
constitutional
context
with
parent-child
relationships
under
the
immigration
law.
and
let's
take
fiallo
v.
bell.
there
the
court
said:
well,
it
tells
us
that
for
married
parents
it's
this
way
and
for
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
that
relationship
is
something
else.
that
could
be
considered
quite
arbitrary
when
the
question
is,
is
the
child
left
orphaned,
but
the
court
said,
well,
that's
what
the
statute
said.
it
made
that
distinction,
and
the
court
upheld
it.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
there
is
--
the
statute
does
say,
parent-child
relationship,
this
is
imputed,
that
is
not.
the
court
dealt
with
that
in
miller
and
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
--
what
you
do
if
the
parents,
the
father
is
an
lpr,
the
mother
is
not?
do
we
then
impute
to
the
child
the
father's
status?
the
couple
is
not
married.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
have
joint
custody.
they
live
together.
they
are
just
not
married.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it's
agreed
that
lpr
status
would
be
necessary.
at
least
mr.
kinnaird
said
that.
it
goes
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
are
talking
about
the
five-year
period
and
the
seven-year
period.
the
child
would
have
to
have
lpr
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
can
he
be
a
resident
without
being
a
domiciliary?
