justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
it
work?
how
does
it
work?
two
legal
permanent
residents,
a
man
and
his
wife,
happen
to
show
up
in
new
york
and
they
have
a
6-month-old
child.
what's
the
legal
--
why
doesn't
the
ins
just
take
the
child,
ship
him
off?
i
mean
there
--
is
it
just
discretion?
or
is
there
some
rule
of
law
or
regulation
that
prevents
that
from
happening?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no.
i
have
given
you
the
hypothetical.
i
mean,
there
we
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
you
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
for
that.
i'm
saying,
what
in
the
law
--
that's
all
you
know,
all
right?
there
are
--
you
know
the
hypothetical.
i
want
--
one
possible
thing
to
say
would
be
that
child
is
--
is
actually
--
we
are
imputing
that
he
is
here
for
lawful
permanent
residence,
too.
every
circuit
has
had
some
kind
of
imputation
rule,
and
moreover
there
are
other
areas
of
law
where
i
have
found
imputation
rules
in
the
immigration
law,
roughly
three
or
four
cases
on
that.
but
they
are
--
they
are
not
exactly
comparable.
okay.
so
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
it
that
prevents
you
from
taking
the
child
and
shipping
him
off
to
china
if
we
don't
impute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
asking
that.
that's
another
question.
i
just
want
your
best
effort--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
give
an
answer.
or
i'm
thinking
that
your
answer
is
there
is
nothing,
it
is
either
imputation
or
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
don't
want
me
to
reach
that
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that
isn't
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
they
came
from
italy,
in
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
--
were
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
the
lepe-guitron
--
that
was
one
of
the
cases
--
it
seems
to
me
clearly
imputes
residence
as
well.
they
quote
the
earlier
case
from
the
circuit
which
said
the
7
years
of
domicile
have
to
come
after
their
admission
for
permanent
residence.
and
then
the
dissent
says:
hey,
what
about
permanent
residents?
and
what
they
say
is
this
case
was
different
because
in
that
earlier
case
the
parents
had
never
been
admitted.
he
came
after
he
was
married
in
this
case
and
was
here
after
his
parents
were
admitted.
now,
i
grant
you
they
didn't
explicitly
say
this,
but
i
don't
see
how
they
reached
their
conclusion
without
it.
and
then
there
is
a
different
split
in
the
circuits
about
the
pro
and
con
of
taking
on
periods,
you
know,
before
the
domicile,
after,
et
cetera.
and
that
seems
to
be
what
congress
resolved.
so
i
think
if
you
are
talking
about
what
was
the
law,
the
law
was
you
did
impute
with
--
you
did
impute
for
residence
and
then
congress
sort
of
just
doesn't
deal
with
that
and
deals
with
a
slightly
different
thing.
is
that
a
fair
reading,
or
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
had
an
example
in
your
brief,
i
thought
you
might
--
i
thought
it
was
an
example
of
status
rather
than
intent.
the
example
that
you
gave
--
i
took
that
way,
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
is
where
an
alien
comes
in
and
wants
asylum,
and
then
you
can't
get
it
if
you
were
resettled
in
another
country.
and
there
are
criteria
--
country
with
a
resettlement
program.
and
then
that
seemed
like
a
status,
a
residence,
where
you
resettled
in
the
other
country,
were
you
not,
that's
his
status,
and
then
that's
imputed
to
the
child?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
--
i
just
want
to
hear
your
whole
argument
here.
you
are
saying
they
would
have
had
congress
as
a
background;
the
ng
case
where
they
imputed
the
hong
kong
residence;
the
fact
that
you
were
about
to
say,
that
domicile
necessarily
includes
residence.
and
is
there
something
else?
