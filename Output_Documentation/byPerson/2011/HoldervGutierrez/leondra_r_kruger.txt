ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
1229b
of
title
8,
an
alien
who
has
not
been
a
lawful
permanent
resident
for
at
least
5
years,
or
who
has
not
continuously
resided
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
7
years
following
admission
in
any
status,
is
not
eligible
for
cancellation
of
removal
under
the
first
prong
of
the
statute.
that
is
true
regardless
of
whether
the
alien
can
show
that
his
parents,
or
any
other
third
party,
for
that
matter,
did
satisfy
those
requirements.
the
ninth
circuit
alone
among
the
courts
of
appeals
has
recognized
a
rule
of
imputed
eligibility
under
section
1229b(a).
that
rule
is
wrong
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
the
touchstones
of
eligibility
under
section
1229b(a),
lpr
status,
admission
and
residence,
are
all
terms
that
are
defined
in
the
ina
to
refer
to
attributes
that
are
individual
to
the
alien
seeking
relief,
attributes
that
cannot
be
satisfied
by
a
third
party.
but
even
if
the
statute
were
thought
to
be
ambiguous
with
respect
to
this
question,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
mean
that
the
alien
seeking
relief
must
personally
and
actually
satisfy
both
durational
requirements.
that
interpretation
is
at
the
very
least
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute,
if
not
the
only
reading
of
the
statute--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--first
of
all,
justice
sotomayor,
we
don't
think
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
so
we
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
go
to
chevron
step
two
in
this
case.
but
if
you
look
at
the
board's
decision
in
re
escobar
in
particular,
i
think
the
board
makes
clear
that,
although
it
thought
the
statutory
language
was
clear,
it
also
rested
its
decision
on
other
considerations
that
are
uniquely
within
the
board's
expertise.
it
discussed
how
the
imputation
rule
comports
with
the
general
policies
of
the
statute,
how
it
comports
with
the
rule
that
the
board
itself
has
recognized
over
time
that
lpr
status
is
something
that's
individual
to
a
particular
alien,
and
that
the
alien
seeking
relief
has
to
individually,
both
procedurally
and
substantively,
satisfy
the
eligibility
requirements.
and
it
also
noted
that
the
imputation
rule
would
create
significant
holes
in
the
statutory
scheme.
it
would
mean
that
an
individual
who
may
not
even
have
been
eligible
for
admission
to
the
united
states
or
lawful
admission
for
permanent
residence
would
nevertheless
receive
a
significant
benefit
that
goes
along
with
that
status.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
does
not
address
issues
of
imputation.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
don't
think
that
a
statute,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
has
to
address
every
conceivable
possibility
in
order
to
be
unambiguous.
and
this
statute
i
think
is
unambiguous
in
that
it
refers
to
eligibility
requirements
that
are
by
their
nature
as
defined
in
immigration
law
individual
to
a
specific
alien.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
right.
the
respondents
relied
very
heavily
on
three
court
of
appeals
cases
that
had
interpreted
the
predecessor
to
this
statute,
former
section
212(c),
to
allow
imputation
of
the
parents'
domicile
to
a
child.
those
courts
relied
on
the
common
law
rule
that
a
child's
domicile
follows
that
of
his
parents.
and
applying
that
rule,
they
allowed
children
to
rely
on
their
parents'
domicile
in
the
united
states
to
satisfy
the
7-year
lawful
unrelinquished
domicile
requirement
in
that
statute.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
under
this
court's
decision
in
holyfield,
the
common
law
rule
is
that
the
child's
domicile
is
determined
by
that
of
his
parents,
regardless
of
where
the
child
resides
in
fact.
when
congress
repealed
former
section
212(c)
and
enacted
the
current
cancellation
of
removal
statute,
it
removed
any
reference
to
the
word
7
years
unrelinquished
domicile
with
two
durational
requirements
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
if
this
court
is
willing
to
presume
along
with
respondents
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
these
three
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
were
issued,
it
should
be
noted,
very
late
in
the
life
of
a
provision
that
had
existed
in
more
or
less
the
same
form
since
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
then
the
court
also
must
presume
that
congress
was
aware
that
the
basis
for
those
decisions
was
the
common
law
definition
of
the
term
"domicile",
and
that
congress
meant
what
it
did
when
it
replaced
"domicile"
with
three
eligibility
criteria
that
are
defined
terms
in
the
immigration
law
and
all
of
which
refer
to
attributes
that
are
individual
to
a
specific
alien.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
under
the
--
how
the
ina
defines
the
term
"residence"
is
an
actual
principal
dwelling
in
fact.
so
yes,
a
child
will
dwell
somewhere
in
fact
and
can
do
so
independent
of
the
parent.
that
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
common
law
rule
of
domicile
that
this
court
explained
at
length
in
its
holyfield
decision
and
that
the
courts
of
appeals
applied
in
interpreting
former
section
212(c).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
a
parent
could.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
necessary
corollary
of
the
way
the
immigration
system
is
constructed.
as
a
general
rule,
lpr
status
and
admission
are
criteria
that
are
individual
to
a
particular
alien.
to
be
sure,
minor
children
of
lawful
permanent
residents
receive
a
high
preference
in
the
immigration
visa
system.
but
there's
no
rule
that
says
that
children
automatically
receive
the
same
legal
status
as
their
lawful
permanent
resident
parents.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
it's
worth
separating
out
two
different
components
of
the
cancellation
of
removal
decision.
it
is
certainly
true
that
it's
an
important
criteria
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
discretion
to
cancellation
of
removal
relief,
how
strong
their
ties
are
to
the
united
states,
what
their
family
ties
are
and
so
on.
but
it
has
never
been
thought
that
particularly
compelling
reasons
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
can
overcome
the
plain
threshold
requirements
for
eligibility
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
under
1229b.
the
difficulty
with
the
imputation
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
recognized
is
that
it
undermines
the
plain
requirements
for
those
threshold
determinations
of
eligibility,
conferring
an
important
benefit
that
goes
along
with
long-time
permanent
resident
status
and
long-time
continuous
residence
after
admission
on
individuals
who
not
only
did
not
receive
the
necessary
formal
authorization
from
immigration
officials
at
the
requisite
time;
they
may
not
even
have
been
eligible
to
receive
those
authorizations.
i
think
it's
also
worth
noting
that
this
statute
is
not
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
discretion
in
the
immigration
system.
it
is
always
true,
and
it
certainly
was
the
case
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1996,
that
immigration
officials
have
the
discretion
not
to
bring
removal
proceedings
in
the
first
place,
to
terminate
removal
proceedings
once
they
have
begun,
to
defer
action
on
the
execution
of
a
removal
order;
and
current
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
guidance
makes
clear
that
a
minor
receives
particular
consideration
within
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
determining
whether
or
not
prosecutorial
discretion
is
something
that
should
be
exercised.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
will
depend
on
the
individual
circumstances.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
right.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
so
congress
has
taken
some
steps
with
respect
to
some
subset
of
aliens.
the
respondent,
for
example,
brings
up
the
life
act,
and
that
is
an
example
of
where
congress
has
taken
a
step
to--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
certainly
not
that
we
impute
the
admission
of
the
child--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--so
if
there
is--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
i
think
that
that
is
incorrect.
there
are
certain
provisions
of
law
that
would
allow
for
the
child
to
be
admitted
on
an
independent
basis
from
the
parents.
if
a
child
is
not
admissible--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
that's
certainly
right.
it
is
also
true
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--right.
the
child
in
your
hypothetical
--
the
child
is
not
born
in
the
united
states,
right?
if
the
child
does
not
independently
satisfy
the
criteria
for
admissibility,
then
the
child
has
entered
the
united
states
illegally
and
remains
here
at
the
discretion
of
immigration
officials.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
mean,
i
think
that
martinez--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
martinez
gutierrez's
situation
i
think
is
a
good
example
of
this.
he
entered
the
united
states
illegally
with
the
--
with
his
parents
and
remained
here
illegally
until
he
was
admitted
as
an
lpr
at
the
age
of
19
as
an
adult.
until
that
time
there
were
no
efforts
to
remove
him
from
the
united
states
and
i
think
that
that
is
fairly
typical,
but
that
is
not
because
his
parents'
admission
or
their
lawful
status
in
the
united
states
was
imputed
for
martinez
gutierrez,
and
there
is
no
background
principle
in
the
law
that
would
allow
for
such
imputation
of
an
individual
formal
authorization
to
remain
in
the
country
by
immigration
officials
to
be
imputed
from
one
to
another.
rather,
the
immigration
system
sets
up
a
system
in
which
a
lawful
permanent
resident
parent
can
seek
to
petition
for
an
immigration
visa
on
behalf
of
the
child
and
facilitate
that
child's
eventual
adjustment
to
lawful
permanent
resident
status,
but
it
is
not
something
happens
automatically.
it's
something
that
happens
through
a
regular,
orderly
process.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
that
would
make
him
ineligible
at
the
age
of
15?
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
the
most
common
scenario
is
one
in
which
a
visa
number
doesn't
become
available
until
the
child
is
--
is--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that
would
be
the
most
common
scenario,
is
--
is
where
the
child
is
in
the
queue,
and
they
think
--
respondents
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
for
visa
numbers
to
become
available
for
both
children
and
spouses
of
lawful
permanent
residents,
but
that
has
been
a
regular
and
acknowledged
feature
of
the
immigration
system
for
decades.
the
congress
that
enacted
iirira
in
1996
was
well
aware
of
the
waiting
times
for
these
visa
numbers.
it
had
before
it
proposals
for
reducing
the
backlog
and
it
rejected
those
proposals.
it
enacted
in
the
cancellation
of
removal
statute
two
eligibility
criteria
that
do
not
turn
on
potential
eligibility
for
receiving
lpr
status
or
admission
to
the
united
states,
but
instead
turn
on
actually
having
received
that
formal
authorization
from
immigration
officials.
and
i
think
that
the
best
inference
that
we
can
draw
from
the
statutory
language
is
that
congress
meant
what
it
said;
it
attached
special
significance
to
that
formal
authorization,
formal
exercise
of
authority
by
immigration
officials
and
not
simply
the
potential
for
that
exercise
in
the
future.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
justice
kagan,
because
the
other
circumstances
in
which
imputation
has
been
allowed
under
the
immigration
laws
differ
in
very
important
respects
from
the
imputation--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
only
reason
that
the
agency
has
allowed
for
imputation
is
that
there
is
good
reason
as
a
general
policy
matter.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
certainly.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
will
try
to
speak
more
directly
into
the
microphone.
the
reason
the
--
the
agency
has
allowed
for
imputation
in
other
circumstances
is
with
respect
to
certain
inquiries
that
involve
an
inquiry
into
the
alien's
intent.
so,
for
example,
the
board
has
allowed
for
imputation
under
section
1182(k),
which
provides
for
discretionary
relief
from
the
attorney
general
when
an
immigrant
did
not
know
or
could
not
have
known
that
they
were
inadmissible.
and
the
board
has
said
that
for
those
purposes
the
parents'
knowledge
of
inadmissibility
is
imputed
to
the
minor
child.
so
too
in
the
context
of
abandonment
of
lpr
status.
the
board
has
said--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
but
i
think
the
critical
point
is
that
the
agency
has
interpreted
imputation
of
intent,
of
state
of
mind,
to
be
permissible,
in
part
for
the
same
reason
that
the
common
law
rule
about
domicile
formed,
which
is
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
that's
--
all
of
the
imputations
that
respondents
have
pointed
to
concern
state
of
mind
type
requirements.
they
don't
concern
formal
authorizations
by
immigration
officials.
the
board
i
think
has
been
very
consistent,
certainly
in
the
context
of
cancellation
of
removal,
in
not
imputing
the
legal
status
of
being
an
lpr
or
admission
from
parent
to
child.
and
it's
difficult
to
see
any
other
examples
in
which
such
imputation
would
be
permissible,
in
part
because
the
background
presumption
of
the
immigration
law
is
that
those
are
both
attributes
that
have
to
be
individually
achieved
and
the
eligibility
criteria
have
to
be
independently
satisfied
by
each
individual
alien.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
that
where
the
imputation
has
come
in,
in
the
board's
analysis
is
with
respect
to
the
state
of
mind
and
not
with
respect
to
the
objective
conduct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it's
--
i
think
where
this
has
come
up
is
in
the
context
of
knowing
that
the
--
that
the
alien
is
not
in
fact
admissible
to
the
united
states,
is
generally
where
it's
come
up.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
but
again,
i
think
that
the
principle
that
the
board
has
applied
is
that,
because
the
child
is
presumed
not
capable
of
forming
a
requisite
intent,
the
parent's
intent
is
imputed
to
the
child.
but
i
think
for
present
purposes
the
critical
point
is,
even
in
that
context,
what
is
being
imputed
is
not
a
formal
status
conferred
on
an
individual
alien
by
immigration
officials,
or
admission,
a
formal
authorization
to
enter
the
country.
that
is
again
conferred
on
an
individual
basis
by
immigration
officials.
i
think
respondents
can
identify
no
circumstance
or
no
precedent
for
that
time
of
imputation,
and
it's
one
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
basic
structure
of
the
immigration
system.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
to
be--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
to
be
clear,
justice
kennedy,
congress
did
not
supply
a
definition
of
the
term
"domicile".
so
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
that
respondents
are
relying
on
followed
the
common
law
rule
that
says
that
a
child's
domicile
follows
that
of
his
parents,
but
those
courts
applied
that
rule
in
very
different
ways.
two
courts
of
appeals
permitted
children
to
benefit
from
the
domicile
of
their
parents
in
the
united
states
even
when
they
were
not
even
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
the
full
7-year
period,
whereas
the
ninth
circuit
for
its
part
applied
that
rule
only
where
the
alien
child
had
been
--
had
entered
the
united
states
lawfully
with
his
parents,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
remains
lawfully
in
the
united
states
thereafter,
and
simply
had
become
an
lpr
outside
of
the
full
7-year
period.
in
crafting
the
current
cancellation
of
removal
statute,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
was
aware
of
these
three
court
of
appeals
opinions
that
were
again
decided
very
late
in
the
life
of
former
section
212(c).
but
even
if
it
had
been
aware
of
those
decisions,
it
also
would
have
been
aware
that
by
using
defined
terms
in
the
ina
that
are
defined
in
a
way
that
is
individual
to
the
particular
alien
it
was
eliminating
any
reference
to
the
common
law
rule.
unlike
domicile,
there
is
no
rule
that
says
that
a
child's
lpr
status
follows
that
of
his
parents
or
that
a
child's
admission
follows
that
of
his
parents.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
first
i'd
like
to
clarify
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
no
reason
to
impute
residence
in
lepe-guitron,
in
part
because
the
alien
in
that
case
had
resided
in
fact
in
the
united
states
throughout
the
7-year
period.
i
think
respondents
make
the
argument
that
lepe-guitron
was
in
fact
imputing
lpr
status
as
opposed
to
residence
in
fact.
but
i
think
that
that
is
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
as
well,
and
that's
for
the
following
reasons.
all
three
courts
of
appeals
that
respondents
rely
on
dealt
separately
with
the
threshold
requirement
under
former
section
212(c)
that
the
alien
be
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
none
of
those
three
courts
permitted
lpr
status
to
be
imputed
from
parent
to
child.
so
where
there
was
an
explicit
requirement
in
the
statute
that
lpr
status
be
obtained
by
the
alien
seeking
relief,
the
courts
were
very
clear
in
requiring
that
the
alien
before
them
independently
satisfied
that
requirement.
in
lepe-guitron,
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
under
circuit
precedent
it
had
held
that
domicile
requires
an
intent
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states
lawfully
and
said
that
that
meant
that
the
alien
had
to
be
in
lpr
status.
lepe-guitron
said
that
with
respect
to
children
that
intent
to
remain
in
the
united
states
lawfully
need
not
be
an
lpr
status
so
long
as
their
parents
were
lawfully
domiciled
in
the
united
states.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
thank
you.
if
i
can
make
three
quick
points--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
don't
think
that
that
is
correct.
the
bia
noted
--
to
be
clear,
the
bia
was
i
think
heavily
influenced
by
what
it
saw
as
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
but
it
also
noted
that
the
imputation
rule
was
inconsistent
with
a
history
of
non-imputation
of
lpr
status,
and
approached
that
--
treats
lpr
status
as
accorded
to
individual
aliens.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
this
goes
back
to
the
answer
i
was
giving
to
justice
breyer
earlier.
where
former
section
212(c)
had
an
explicit
lawful
status
requirement,
which
is
the
status
of
being
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
no
court
of
appeals
allowed
imputation
from
parents
to
child.
their
argument
is
a
little
bit
more
convoluted
than
that.
it
is
that
because
domicile,
lawful
unrelinquished
domicile,
was
interpreted
to
mean
the
ability
to
form
a
lawful
intent
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
you
could
only
form
such
an
intent
if
you
were
a
lawful
permanent
resident,
that
in
lepe-guitron,
the
ninth
circuit
was
therefore
necessarily
imputing
lpr
status
from
parent
to
child.
i
think
the
more
straightforward
way
to
read
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
that
it
was
imputing
the
intent
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states
from
parent
to
child,
based
in
part
on
the
parents'
establishment
of
the
domicile,
and
based
on
the
common
law
rule
that
the
child's
domicile
follows
that
of
his
parents.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
in
--
in
addition
to
discussing
the
individual
nature
of
lpr
status,
they
also
noted
the
consequence
of
the
ninth
circuit's
imputation
rule
would
be
to
permit
a
kind
of
end
run
around
the
substantive
eligibility
requirements
for
lpr
status.
so
theoretically,
you
could
have
an
individual
minor
alien
who's
not
eligible,
who's
inadmissible
for
adjustment
of
status
who
would
nevertheless
be
accorded
a
substantial
benefit
of
that
status
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
he
could
have
received
that
status
in
fact.
i'd
like
to--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--under
the
--
under
former
section
212(c).
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
again--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no
court
had
imputed
lpr
status
the
threshold
requirement
for
relief
under
the
--
under
the
predecessor
statute
from
parent
to
child.
so
it
wasn't
the
case
that
somebody
who
was
actually
ineligible
for
--
for
lpr
status
would
nevertheless
be
eligible
for
waiver
of
removal
under
--
under
that
provision.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
right.
and
i
think
that
concession--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
think
that
concession
is
important
for
the
following
reason.
when
congress
enacted
the
present
cancellation
of
removal
statute,
it
preserved
that
threshold
requirement
that
you
have
to
be
an
lpr
in
order
to
seek
relief,
but
it
added
the
durational
requirement.
you
had
to
have
attained
that
status
at
least
5
years
before
you
sought
relief.
there's
no
reason
to
think,
if
there's
no
precedent
for
imputing
lpr
status
in
the
first
place,
that
there
would
be
precedence
for
imputing
lpr
status
going
back
5
years.
one
necessarily
follows
from
the
other.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
address
the
other
proposition
that
respondent
sawyers
makes,
that
courts
were
necessarily
imputing
residence
as
an
element
of
domicile.
that
argument
relies
heavily
on
the
1967
regional
commissioner
decision
dealing
with
firm
resettlement.
if
you
look
at
that
decision,
you'll
see
that
the
regional
commissioner
focused
very
intensely
on
the
minor
alien's
particular
actions
--
identity,
documents
that
he
received
personally
from
the
foreign
country,
his
own
schooling
and
to
residence,
and
the
degree
to
which
the
regional
commissioner
rested
on
principles
of
imputation
is
entirely
unclear.
