mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
so
far
as
subsection
(2)
of
the
provision
that
we
are
talking
about
this
morning,
which
is
the
provision
that
concerns
me
in
the
sawyers
case,
we
think
that
the
government's
reading
is
simply
not
a
sensible
approach
to
the
statute.
and
in
that
sense,
our
position
is
not
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
we
think
that
the
statutory
context
and
the
particular
meaning
of
the
words
that
congress
used
require
imputation
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
will
start
with
the
statutory
background,
where
i
think
the
government
understates
the
nature
of
the
prevailing
settled
rule
that
it
applied.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
imputation
as
such,
as
has
been
said,
is
not
directly
addressed.
but
the
words
that
congress
used,
the
word
"residence"
and
the
words
particularly
"continuous
residence",
are
words
that
congress
would
have
thought
carried
along
with
it
the
concept
of
imputation.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
so,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
start
with
a
little
bit
of
the
background
both
of
the
statute
and
how
those
words
have
been
interpreted
in
prior
usages,
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
when
it
used
them
in
the
statute.
under
the
prior
relief
provision
here,
section
212(c),
the
old
provision,
the
courts,
courts
of
appeals
that
had
addressed
it,
had
uniformly
applied
an
imputation
rule.
the
government
said
--
it's
three
courts.
two
of
those
courts
are
the
second
and
ninth
circuits,
the
largest
immigration
circuits
that
decide
two-thirds
of
the
immigration
cases
in
the
country.
so
i
think
one
can
presume
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
this
rule.
and
the
government
concedes
that
congress
didn't
change
the
language
of
212(c)
because
it
was
dissatisfied
with
imputation.
it
had
other
purposes
in
mind
altogether.
and
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
rule
--
it
says
nothing
directly
about
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
there
could
be
circumstances
in
which
imputation
is
appropriate
when
the
child
is
in
the
custody
of
the
grandparent.
but
i'm
focusing
on
parents
because
that's
how
the
cases
have
been
decided
up
to
that
point.
the
bia
itself
had
said,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute
in
the
in
re
ng
case
that
--
which
i
think
is
the
case
the
justice
breyer
had
referred
to
--
it
had
said
in
so
many
words:
the
residence
of
the
parent
is
imputed
to
child
when
the
child
is
a
minor.
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
that
when
it
use
the
word
(2).
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
are
rules,
common
law
rules,
that
the
courts
had
applied
in
determining
whose
residence
and
whose
domicile
would
be
attributed
to
the
child
when
the
parents
were
not
--
didn't
have
joint
custody.
when
the
--
if
we
are
talking
only
about
residence--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
--
again,
the
courts
have
applied
--
if
it
we
are
distinguishing
--
for
purposes
of
residence,
and
i'm
not
talking
bower
the
technical
lpr
status
here
when
i
use
the
term
"residence",
i
am
referring
simply
to
kind
of
a
general
common
law
concept.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
agree
ultimately
to
get
relief,
the
child
has
to
have
lpr
status,
and
certainly
under
subsection
(1)
of
the
provision,
which
is
not
at
issue
in
the
sawyers
case.
that
concerns
five
years
of
lpr
status.
subsection
(2),
which
is
all
that
i'm
concerned
with
in
sawyers,
because
that's
the
only
element
of
the
relief
provision
in
that
he
was
deemed
not
to
satisfy,
concerns
only
the
term
lpr,
as
such;
simply
continuous
residence
in
the
united
states.
and
so
the
question
of:
would
congress
have
thought
that
residence,
continuous
residence
is
imputable
from
parent
to
child?
i
think
it
would
have
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
would
have
believed
that
residence
as
a
general
matter
is
imputable.
the
bia
had
said
to
itself
in
the
ng
case.
and
as
it
--
domicile,
which
the
government
concedes
was
imputable,
necessarily
includes--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
was
indeed.
it
was
a
firm
resettlement
case.
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
alien
had
been
a
resident
of
hong
kong.
and
the
parents
were
residents,
and
the
bia
said:
well,
the
parents'
residence
is
imputed
to
the
child.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
record
doesn't
reflect
--
we
don't
know
if
he
was
living
in
u.s.
in
an
unlawful
status
up
until
the
point
he
became
an
lpr
at
age
15.
the
record
simply
doesn't
answer
that
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
the
principle
in
--
that's
correct.
but
i
can
add
to
that
a
little
bit
that
in
the
section
212
cases,
in
which
domicile
was
imputed
in
--
as
the
government
recognizes
in
at
least
two
of
those
cases,
the
child
was
not
in
the
united
states
for
a
portion
of
that
time
and,
therefore,
necessarily
those
courts
must
have
been
imputing
not
only
domicile
but
residence.
and
that
is
necessarily
the
case
because
--
residence
is
an
element,
a
subset
of
domicile.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
a
--
as
a
legal
matter.
just
as
he
was
--
would
have
been
domiciled
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
not.
i
think
--
i
think
our
common
law
would
have
regarded
him
as
a
resident
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
might
be
legal
rules
that
--
that
specify
the
physical
presence
is
equivalent
to
residence
for
particular
purposes.
but
as
this
court
held
in
holyfield,
as
the
government
recognizes
in
a
domicile
context,
a
child
can
be
a
domicile
of
a
jurisdiction
in
which
they
have
never
set
foot.
the
--
the
legal
presumption
is
that
the
child
is
--
takes
the
domicile
of
the
parent,
and
--
and
residence
is
a
necessary
subset,
as
this
court
has
said
long
ago,
before
any
of
these
statutes
were
passed.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
one
can
be
--
yes,
because
the
definition,
as
this
court
said,
of
"domicile"
is
residence
in
a
particular
place
accompanied
by
an
intent
to
remain
there
indefinitely.
and
so
you
have
to
have
both.
you
can't
be
a
domicile
without
being
a
resident
of
the
jurisdiction.
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
that.
and
when
it
used
the
term
212(t),
imputation
rule
for
relief
in
the
immigration
laws,
that
use
of
the
term
"resident"
carries
with
it
imputation.
i
think
that
makes
this
--
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
makes
the
use
of
the
term
"continuous
residence"
in
subsection
b
unambiguous
and
requires
imputation.
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
this.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
government
concedes
that
congress
was
not
trying
to
change
the
imputation
rule
when
it
changed
the
terminology
from
"domicile"
to
"resident".
in
fact,
it's
sort
of
perverse
to
say
that
congress
had
--
achieved
that
purpose,
because
it
was
a
--
this
was
a
liberalizing
change.
the
reason
that
congress
--
it's
quite
clear
from
the
statutory
background
why
congress
changed
the
language
from
7
years
unrelinquished
lawful
domicile>
["]
in
the
old
212(c)
to
"continuous
residence
after
admission
in
any
status.
"
in
--
in
subsection
b
of
the
new
statute
--
was
to
broaden
the
availability
of
relief.
congress
was
confronted
with
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
the
interpretation
of
the
old
rule,
as
to
whether
or
not
one
could
achieve
unrelinquished
domicile
--
lawful
unrelinquished
domicile
while
not
in
an
lpr
status,
because
the
bia
had
taken
the
position
that
for
--
to
have
lawful
domicile,
you
have
to
lawfully
intend
to
stay
here
permanently;
you
can't
do
that
if
you're
not
an
lpr.
and
therefore,
congress,
confronting
the
split
on
circuits
--
because
some
courts
had
rejected
the
bia's
view,
congress
said
okay,
we're
going
to
in
subsection
a
of
the
new
statute
a
requirement:
5
years
lpr
status.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
for
--
for
the
child?
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--for
--
for
an
adult,
the
language
that
they
did
use,
because
i
think
"continuous
residence"
carries
with
it
the
requirement
that
the
person
be
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
for
a
minor--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
would
think,
given
the
context,
of
which
imputation
was
the
settled
rule,
that
congress
would
have
had
to
indicate
affirmatively
that
imputation
was
impermissible.
just
as
if
--
if
congress
uses
the
term
212(c),
knowing
the
context
in
which,
as
a
universal
matter,
the
domicile
of
the
parents
is
attributed
to
the
child
--
one
would--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
and
--
and
"reside"
can
have
different
meanings
in
different
contexts.
there
is
a
definition
in
the
statute
which
the
bia
itself
has
said
does
not
apply
to
conditional
uses
of
the
term,
so,
you
know,
residence
in
its
plainest
sense
--
i
mean,
as
this
court
said
in
the
savorgnan
case,
which
is
where
congress
derived
the
reg
--
the
definition
which
is
now
in
the
ina
--
that
was
the
plainest
use
of
the
term
"residence".
you
know,
unadorned.
and
that
was
the
statutory
definition
which
says
without
regard
to
intent.
but
when
there's
a
conditional
use,
when
it's
continuous
residence,
as
in
subsection
b
of
the
statute,
or
permanent
residence,
necessarily
one
has
to
look
at
intent.
and
therefore,
that
statutory
definition
cannot
apply.
the
bia
itself
has
said
that
expressly
in
the
wong
case,
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
but
so
far
as
permanent
residence
is
concerned,
the
statutory
definition
has
no
application
because
necessarily,
one
has
to
look
to
intent.
and
so
--
it's
sort
of
a
second
--
secondary
argument
here.
but
insofar
as
intent
is
essential
for
imputation,
which
is
what
the
government
says
--
the
government
says
the
reason
that
--
the
switch
from
"domicile"
to
"residence"
matters
is
because
domicile
looks
to
intent,
and
residence
doesn't.
but
in
fact,
continuous
residence
does
--
necessarily
does
look
to
intent
because
it's
the
intent
to
remain
continuously
or
permanently--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
--
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
here,
of
course,
is
--
is
a
particular
relief
from
a
removal
provision.
and
so
certainly,
the
--
the
expectation
that
the
child
someday
down
the
road
may
seek
relief
from
removal,
become
--
become
an
lpr
and
do
something
wrong
is
not
going
to
induce
parents--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
can't
give
you
current
statistics.
i
think
this
court
said,
i
believe
in
the
st.
cyr
case,
that
a
fairly
--
substantial
--
40
percent
or
so
of
the
cases
are
granted.
the
gutierrez
case,
in
fact,
the
ij
would
have
granted
removal
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
believe
that
that's
--
i
wouldn't
swear
to
that,
your
honor,
but
--
but
it
is
a
--
a
significant
percentage.
and
again,
gutierrez
is
an
example,
that
the
iha
would
have
granted
it
but
for
the
--
rejection
of
the
imputation
rule
further
on
in
the
--
in
the
process.
and
i
think
this
is
actually
a
kind
of
a
significant
point,
which
goes
to
what
congress
would
have
had
in
mind.
we
are
only
talking
about
not
entitlement
to
relief,
we're
talking
about
entitlement
to
ask
the
attorney
general,
in
the
exercise
of
his
unreviewable
discretion,
to
grant
relief
to
deserving
immigrants
who
would
otherwise
be
forced
out
of
the
country
by
application
of
an
inflexible
rule.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
he
--
it
is
unreviewable
discretion,
yes,
if
you
take
anything
into
account
--
and
certainly,
the
nature
of
the
family
ties,
the
--
the
background
of
the
immigrant,
all
of
those
things
are
taken
into
account,
but
the
question
--
whether
or
not
congress
when
it
passed
this
statute,
knowing
how
section
212(c)
had
been
interpreted,
the
prospect
that
congress
meant
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
can
give
you--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
can
give
you
two
responses
to
that,
if
i
may,
justice
sotomayor.
first,
yes,
it
is
a
presumption
that
congress
is
aware
of
judicial
decisions,
but
i
think
that
presumption--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
but
in
this
particular
context,
there's
particular
reason
to
think
they
would,
because
congress,
it
is
agreed,
enacted
this
legislation
to
cure
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
involving
the
application
of
this
cancellation
provision.
and
so
there
would
have
been
particular
reason
for
congress
to
be
aware
of
what
the
courts
had
done.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
--
i
can
rest
at
this
point,
your
honor.
thank
you
so
much.
