i
guess
the
child
doesn't
have
any
domicile
except
the
parents;
right?
children
who
run
--
run
away
from
home
do
not
acquire
new
domiciles,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
suppose
if
they
come
with
somebody
else's
6-month-old
child,
they
would
have
to
send
that
child
back
to
china,
too,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
very
sad,
but
that
would
be
the
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
should
not
have
sent
him
back
to
china,
then.
why
did
they
do
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
can't
hear
you
very
well.
would
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--crank
up
the
thing
or
something?
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that
first
one
usually
cuts
against
the
immigrant,
i
would
assume.
so
if
the
parents
know,
the
child
knows,
and
the
child
normally
would
not
know,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can
you
give
any
example
--
the
government
says
you
can't
--
of
an
instance
where
status
is
imputed,
not
intent,
but
just
status;
where
the
status
that
the
parents
have
is
automatically
given
to
the
child,
or
for
that
matter
automatically
taken
away
from
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
--
there,
you're
--
what
they
are
imputing
is
the
intent
to
remain
in
the
place,
right?
and
that's
--
that's
an
intent.
that's
imputing
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
child
would
not
have
been
lawfully
there
but
for
the
imputation
of
lawfulness
from
the
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
it
an
adequate
reason
that
they've
come
up
with
here
and
in
their
decisions
that
the
prior
word
was
"domicile"
and
a
child's
domicile
is
that
of
the
parents,
and
that
the
word
under
the
new
statute
is
"residence"
and
the
child's
residence
is
not
necessarily
the
residence
of
the
parent?
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
valid
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but
it's
a
different
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
one
word
demands
imputation,
the
other
doesn't.
so
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
there
is
no
--
no
rationale
basis
given
by
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
was
residence
at
issue
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
i'm
--
i'm
curious,
how
often
--
this
dispute
here
is
simply
about
whether
the
attorney
general
is
permitted
to
cancel
removal,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
often
does
our
--
are
applications
for
cancellation
of
removal
granted?
i
mean,
is
it
a
common
phenomenon,
or
are
we
really
talking
here
about
just
spinning
it
out
longer
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
person
who
will
ultimately
be
deported
can
stay
here
that
much
longer.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
as
high
as
40
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
do
you
respond
to
the
point
that
lawfulness
has
been
attributed,
not
just
intent,
but
under
the
prior
law,
lawfulness
was
also
attributed?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
case
under
the
prior
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it's
not
unthinkable.
