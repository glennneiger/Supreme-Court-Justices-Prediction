chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1542,
holder
v.
gutierrez,
and
the
consolidated
case.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
that
you
think
the
statute
is
unambiguous,
but
it
--
it
doesn't
address
issues
of
imputation
at
all,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it
doesn't
even
address
it,
it
seems
to
me
the
best
you
can
say
is
that
it's
ambiguous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kinnaird.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
am
having
trouble
applying
the
concepts
of
unambiguous
and
ambiguous
in
this
situation.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
this
is
something
that
the
statute
just
doesn't
deal
with,
and
i
don't
know
that
you
characterize
that
correctly
as
ambiguous.
it's
just
kind
of
off
the
table.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
grapple
with
everything
that's
not
there.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
the
statutes
don't
address.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
don't
have
to
grapple
with
everything
that's
there.
you
just
have
to
say
this
doesn't
address
it.
so
whoever
is
asking
for
the
affirmative,
which
is
you,
loses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
saying:
we
think
this
law
should
allow
--
should
provide
for
this,
should
extend
for
this.
and
it's
one
thing
to
say,
well,
the
statute's
ambiguous;
it
talks
about
children
in
one
category
but
not
another
category,
so
the
issue's
there,
we
don't
know
what
they
meant.
it
is
another
thing
if
it's
something
that's
totally
not
on
the
table.
i
mean,
if
you
claim
that
the
law
required
every
minor
to
get
$500
a
year,
you
wouldn't
say
the
statute
was
ambiguous
about
that.
you
would
say
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
it
--
why
can't
the
bia
adopt
or
why
doesn't
the
background
principle
apply
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
admission
unless
you
make
an
affirmative
case
for
it?
you
say,
well,
the
--
the
government
hasn't
advanced
any
policy
reason
on
the
other
side.
why
isn't
that
the
basic
policy
of
the
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kinnaird.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
usually
like
to
start
with
the
statutory
language.
where
is
this
issue
addressed
in
this
statute
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
the
statute
say
about
imputation
of
individuals'
residence
to
grandparents?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
nothing
about
it.
so
would
you
say
the
statute
is
ambiguous
on
whether
or
not
residents'
legal
--
permanent
residence
status
should
be
imputed
to
grandparents?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
one
of
the
things
you
could
take
into
account
in
exercising
his
discretion
is
whether
we're
actually
dealing
with
a
minor,
or
as
i
understand
in
this
case,
it's
someone
who
is
quite
a
bit
older?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
said
you
had
two
points
in
this
--
do
--
do
you
want
to
get
your
second
out,
in
half
a
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
ms.
kruger,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel
--
counsel,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
whether
they
gave
a
policy
reason,
your
answer
was
that
they,
you
know,
followed
the
history.
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
same
as
a
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

have

morning
beginning
with

kagan

gutierrez
and
