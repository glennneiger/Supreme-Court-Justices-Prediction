mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
children
present
special
problems
under
the
immigration
laws
and,
as
discussed,
both
the
courts
and
the
agency
in
various
contexts
have
resorted
to
imputation
to
cure
those
problems.
here
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
imputation,
and
ambiguity
arises
as
applied
to
the
special
circumstance
of
children
who
were
minors
during
the
years
in
question.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
it's
ambiguous
as
applied
to
this
specific
circumstance.
and
the
ambiguity
arises
because
the
requirements
for
which
there
is
imputation,
status
and
residency,
are
matters
that
are
not
within
the
capacity
or
the
control
of
a
minor.
a
minor
does
not
decide
whether
or
when
a
parent
will
apply
for
lpr
status
for
him
or
her.
he
does
not
control
the
maintenance
of
that
status
over
a
period
of
years,
and
he
also
does
not
control
where
he
resides.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
section
212(c)
imputed
status,
as
the
ninth
circuit
found.
the
reason
was
that
the
requirement
there
was
not
just
for
unrelinquished
domicile
but
lawful
unrelinquished
domicile,
and
therefore
they
had
to
reach
back
to
the
period
in
which
the
parent
was
an
lpr--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--no,
they
also
had
to
impute
lawfulness,
which
meant
that
the
parent
had
to
be
an
lpr
for
that
period
or
at
least
in
some
lawful
status.
and
in
each
of
the
three
instances
the
parents
were
lpr's
in
the
times
in
question.
so
there
definitely
was
a
foregoing
rule
of
imputation
of
status.
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--that's
right.
well,
he
would
not
have
qualified
for
a
waiver
of
removal.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
think
if
it
is
ambiguous,
then
the
bia
actually
has
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
grapple
with
that
ambiguity.
and
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
magic
words,
but
what
it
has
to
do
is
actually
grapple
with
and
recognize
the
ambiguity,
at
least
in
the
alternative,
and
then
exercise
its
discretion
to
say
if
this
is
a
permissible
construction
of
the
act
and
there
is
another
permissible
construction,
which
of
the
two
better
serves
the
statutory
purpose.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
agreed.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
don't
think--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
ambiguity
arises
here
because
the
matters
in
question
are
ones
not
within
the
capacity
or
control
of
the
minor,
and
that's
been
the
traditional
basis
on
which
the
bia
has
looked
for
imputation.
and
when
you
take
into
account--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
don't
think
that's
right.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
that,
but
i
think
the
better
reading
of
the
statute,
even
if
(a)(1)
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that
point,
is
that
you
have
to
be
an
lpr
in
order
to
seek
cancellation.
and
then
for
these
durational
requirements
and
the
lookback
to
status,
there
you
do
imputation.
and
the
reason
is
twofold.
one,
section
212(c)
which
it
replaced
was
limited
to
lpr's.
the
second
is
that
there
is
a
separate
subsection,
subsection
(b)
of
that
same
statute.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
addenda
provided
to
the
courts,
but
it
is
cancellation
of
removal
for
certain
nonpermanent
resident
aliens.
and
the
critical
distinction
between
the
two
besides
differences
in
criteria
is
that
that
one
authorizes
adjustment
of
status
as
well
as
cancellation.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
so
if
you
are
not
an
actual
lpr,
you
need
to
have
adjustment
of
status
to
not
be
in
a
legal
limbo.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
if
there
is
a
significant
separation
of
that
duration,
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
about
whether
you
have
the
significant
relationship
between
parent
and
child
to
warrant
imputation.
but
it
is
true
that
under
former
section
212(c),
at
least
in
two
of
the
cases,
they
imputed
residency
when
the
child
was
not
actually
resident.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
that's
right.
and
the
resettlement
doesn't
have
any
element
of
intent
to
it.
so
it's
not
true
that
everything
turns
upon
intent.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
under
section
(a)(1)
it's
not
simply
a
requirement
that
there
have
been
some
grant
of
lpr
status
at
some
point
and
passage
of
5
--
of
5
years.
the
statutory
definition
of
"lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence"
includes
a
requirement
the
status
has
not
changed.
and
that
requires
domiciliary
intent,
because
the
bia
has
interpreted
that
phrase
to
mean
that
you
can
change
your
status
by
intent
and
in
fact
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
defended
against
cancellation
claims
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
abandonment
during
the
5-year
period.
so
if
you
had
a
child
coming
forth,
you
have
to
look
in
certain
circumstances
at
least
to
the
parent
for
intent
of
abandonment.
so
i
think
this
is
an
element
where
there
is
direct
continuity
from
section
212(c).
it
makes
eminent
sense.
and
even
if
the
bia
is
deemed
to
have
exercised
its
discretion
here,
i
think
its
rule
is
patently
unreasonable,
and
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
they
are
not
able
to
advance
a
single
policy
reason
that
would
be
favorable
to
non-imputation.
it
destroys
family
unity
and
it
forecloses
eligibility
for
relief
for
even
people
like
mr.
martinez
gutierrez,
who
has
lived
here
since
the
age
of
5.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
congress
has
the
latitude
to
be
--
to
draw
arbitrary
lines.
i
don't
think
the
agency
does
if
imputation
is
a
permissible
alternative.
i
think
they
have
to
give
a
reasoned
basis
for
denying
imputation
when
it
was
the
prior
rule.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
think
they
have
to
look
to
the
actual
statute
and
they
have
to
give
their
own
reasons,
which
i
don't
think
they
have
done
adequately
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that's
chevron
step
2
discretion.
but
i
think
you
also
have
to
look
to
the
fact
that
there
was
not
only
imputation
of
domicile;
it
required
lawfulness.
and
in
imputing
domicile
they
were
also
imputing
residence.
so
it's
true
the
word
domicile--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--it's
a
different
word.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
the
rational
basis
comes
in,
if
there
is
ambiguity
and
they
are
determining
why,
if
it's
a
permissible
construction,
why
it
should
be
rejected
or
not.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
would
say
the
statute
has
an
equitable
purpose
which
allows
imputation.
i
do
not
think
there
is
discretion
if
imputation
is
permissible,
unless
there
is
a
rational
basis
in
serving
the
policies
of
the
act,
to
deny
imputation.
and
discretion
does
come
in
at
the
second
phase,
which
is
when
the
attorney
general
determines
whether
or
not
the
cancellation
should
be
granted.
so
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
a
statute
strictly
for
eligibility,
simply
to
get
to
the
phase
where
there
is
unreviewable
discretion
in
the
attorney
general
to
deny
relief.
and
this
is
a
once-in-a-lifetime
remedy.
you
can
only
apply
for
cancellation
once
in
your
life.
so
i
think
in
the
special
circumstance
of
children
who
were
minors
during
the
period,
who
could
not
have
controlled
this
status,
could
not
have
controlled
their
residence,
this
is
an
eminently
reasonable
rule
that
is
backed
by
congress.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
right.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
and
if
--
and
bia,
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
draw
a
narrower
rule
and
we
could
prevail
under
that
rule,
but
i
think
the
rationale
is
family
unity;
that
even
though
there
are
periods
of
residence
where
there
is
a
dysjunction,
the
real
reason
is
simply
the
operation
of
quotas.
and
there
was
a
historical
practice
of
allowing
imputation
of
residence.
since
you
still
have
the
family
ties,
i
think
imputation
is
permissible
there,
as
long
as
you
have
this
significant
relationship.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
they
are
alternative
arguments.
they
certainly
didn't
explain
it.
i
would
also
say
it's
unreasonable
per
se:
one,
because
they
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
of
lack
of
custody
and
control.
that's
been
the
basis
for
their
abandonment
decisions.
they
have
invoked
imputation
only
to
the
detriment
of
the
alien
where
the
child
has
no
intent
whatsoever.
so
there
is
no
common
law
principle
for
imputing
mens
rea,
for
example,
knowledge
of
inadmissibility
to
a
child;
no
basis
for
really
imputing
an
intent
to
abandon
when
the
child
has
none
whatsoever.
so
at
the
very
least,
they
have
to
explain
that.
and
because
--
and
the
bia
has
also
not
really
taken
into
account,
the
nature
of
these
is
simply
eligibility
rules.
thank
you.
