justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
did
it
make
that
determination
as
a
legal
matter
or
as
an
exercise
of
its
discretion?
as
i
read
its
opinion,
it
felt
that
it
had
to
come
to
that
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
law.
if
we
were
to
find--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
statute
ambiguous,
where
has
it
explained
its
policy
decisions
independent
of
its
legal
conclusions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
we
don't
accept
respondent's,
what
appears
to
be
their
argument,
that
being
an
lpr
is
not
a
requirement
of
the
statute,
if
we
assume
that
being
an
lpr
is
what
triggers
the
availability
for
the
attorney
general's
exercise
of
discretion,
how
does
that
--
how
does
the
imputation
rule
harm
the
statute?
the
child
has
lived
with
the
parents
for
5
years,
whether
before
or
after
--
well,
after
it
wouldn't
be
an
issue,
but
before
the
grant
of
lpr
status.
how
does
that
harm
the
purposes
of
the
statute?
i
thought
the
idea
of
the
statute
was
to
give
individuals
who
had
ties
to
the
united
states
an
opportunity
to
stay.
if
a
child's
been
with
their
parents
for
5,
10,
15
years,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
deprive
them
of
the
attorney
general's
exercise
of
discretion
merely
because
the
administrative
process
has
taken
too
long
to
give
them
something
which
they
are
going
to
get
and
which
they've
gotten?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
a
parent's
fraudulent
conduct
imputed
to
a
child?
there's
no
intent
there.
the
child
obviously
doesn't
have
an
intent
or
couldn't
have
an
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
so
why
is
that
imputed
by
the
bia,
other
than
that
it's
a
holding
against
the
immigrant,
which
your
adversary
points
out
is
not
a
very
favorable
outlook
for
the
agency,
it
only
imputes
when
it
harms
the
immigrant.
but
putting
that
aside,
there
is
no
intent
involved
in
the
fraud.
it's
just
the
commission
of
an
act.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
state
of
mind
of
committing
an
act,
like
a
fraudulent
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
child
doesn't
commit
a
fraudulent
act.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
the
problems
that
i
have
is
that
i
see
the
imputation
as
an
equitable
doctrine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
me
that
often
means
discretionary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it
is
that,
discretionary,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
more
the
bia
has
to
say
than
1229b(a)(2).
isn't
that
an
end
run
on
stopping
this
continuous
7-year
statute,
or
10,
whatever
it
is,
if
we
are
imputing
a
parent's
residence,
or
any
of
the
things
that
you
are
--
that
the
government
said,
the
bia
said,
in
rendering
its
decision?
i
mean,
you
can't
force
a
court
to
impute
--
the
bia
to
impute.
so
what
more
do
they
have
to
say
than:
we
don't
think
it's
consistent
with
the
statute,
even
if
it
is
ambiguous
to
do
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
so
reasonable
about
a
child
who
lives
with
their
grandparents
outside
the
country?
why
should
their
parents
being
in
the
u.s.
be
imputed
to
the
benefit
of
that
child?
i
certainly
understand
it
in
your
client's
situation.
your
client
is
the
one
who
has
been
here
since
5
years
old.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
for
factual
correction,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
whether
he
was
living
with
his
mother,
mr.
sawyers
was
living
with
his
mother.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
answer
to
that
is?
is
this
is
child
living
with
a
grandparent
out
of
the
country
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
that's
a
very
big
assumption.
yes,
it's
the
two
biggest
circuits
who
have
defined
domicile
and
imputation,
but
it
wasn't
us,
number
1.
and
number
2,
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
they
didn't
adopt
the
same
word,
"domicile",
they
changed
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
what
the
bia
was
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
can't
be
aware
of
all
the
judicial
decisions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument,
because
they've
conceded
that
you
need
the
--
the
child
needs
their
own
lpr
status
before
it
triggers--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
residency.
