and
--
and
is
that
change
alone
sufficient
for
us
to
say
that
this
is
--
was
a
clear
indication
by
the
congress
of
an
intent
or
purpose
to
alter
the
imputation
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
a
parent
ask
for
a
permanent
resident
status
for
a
5-year-old
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
have
two
cases,
one,
two
5-year-olds.
one,
as
in
this
case,
lives
with
the
parent,
but
the
application
has
not
been
granted
or
not
been
filed;
and
the
other,
the
application
has
been
granted,
and
they're
treated
--
they're
treated
differently?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
an
instance
in
which
the
child
who
is
the
child
of
two
lawful
permanent
residents
cannot
get
lawful
permanent
resident
status
for
himself
at
the
age
of
8,
but
that
he
can
at
15?
i
mean,
what
commonly
happens
between
that
period
that
would
make
him
--
eligible
only
when
he
is
15,
other
than
just
as
a
matter
of
providing
all
the
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
--
the
whole
point
here
is
that
some
children
are
given
lawful
permanent
resident
status
and
--
and
some
are
not.
but
i'm
asking
does
the
passage
of
time,
assuming
two
lawful
resident
parents,
ever
make
it
so
that
a
child
who
was
formerly
ineligible
is
now
eligible?
he
was
ineligible
at
5,
but
he
is
eligible
at
14?
i
mean,
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
know,
a
visa
number.
but
nothing
--
nothing
with
--
with
respect
to
the
child's
real
status
other
than
his
--
where
he
is
on
the
queue
in
the
immigration
department?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
odd
that
the
domicile
is
the
more
exacting
of
the
two
requirements
and
yet
the
congress
allowed
imputation
in
the
domicile
case
but
not
--
not
in
the
residence
case.
it
seems
almost
backwards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
congress
enacts
a
more
forgiving,
less
exacting
standard,
but
then
takes
away
the
imputation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--mr.
kinnaird,
what
would
happen
if
the
child
remains
with
the
grandparents
in
mexico
and
his
parents
are
living
in
los
angeles
for
6
years
until
they
can
afford
to
take
him.
is
the
parents'
residence
then
imputed
to
the
child
so
that
when
he
moves
to
los
angeles
in
year
7
he
is
deemed
to
have
been
there
for
6
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
kinnaird,
i'm
having
trouble
figuring
out,
is
your
view
that
non-imputation
is
just
unreasonable
per
se,
or
is
your
view
that
they
didn't
explain
non-imputation
properly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
there
some
advantage
to
giving
parents
an
incentive
to
apply
for
early
lawful
permanent
residence?
because
under
your
view,
parents
wouldn't
have
to
bother
to
apply
for
it
at
all.
i'm
--
i'm
wondering
about
the
consequences
of
deciding
in
your
favor.
and
the
other
one,
quite
distinct
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
probably
would
not
be
some
floodgate
of
--
of
imputed
residence
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
respondent
said
that
the
bia
gave
no
policy
reasons,
no
policy
justifications,
for
its
--
for
its
interpretation.
is
that
correct
in
your
view?
