but
mr.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--sorry.
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
provide
you
situs
on
the
adjacent
waters.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see,
so
you
are
saying
you
don't
even
--
you're
not
going--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
do
you
get
to
the
water
above
the
shelf?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
instead
of
saying
they
are
part
of
the
shelf?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
the
issue
that
justice
kennedy
was
alluding
to
was
the
example
the
ninth
circuit
used:
a
pitcher
on
the
mound
throws
a
baseball
and
hits
the
batter.
the
situs
is
not
the
mound,
but
the
injury
has
occurred
as
a
result
of
pitching,
and
so
he's
coming
up
with
examples
and
i
think
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
saying
when
it
was
creating
the
test
of
the
substantial
nexus
between
the
operation
and
the
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
the
part
of
your
--
of
your
definition
that
gives
no
credence
to
that
possibility.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
may
be
arguing
that
as
a
factual
matter
what
this
man
was
doing
on
land
was
not
a
substantial
nexus.
that's
a
different
issue
than
providing
a
test
that
limits
injury
to
an
operation
solely
on
the
shelf.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you're
not
--
you
don't
want
a
but-for
test.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
you
don't
want
a
proximate
cause
test.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
this
meet
your
definition
of
causation
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
a
new
version
of
proximate
cause.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
substantial
nexus
is
just
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
accept
your
adversary's
position
that
whatever
causal
--
you
have
to,
given
your
status
test.
where
are
you
drawing
your
status
test
from?
meaning,
obviously
it's
not
from
the
language.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not
--
i
would
have
just
thought
you
would
have
taken
it
out
of
(b)
subdivision
(2),
the
term
"employer",
almost
the
obverse,
means
an
employer
--
means
an
employer
any
of
whose
employees
are
employed
in
such
operations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
the
worker
who
went
to
the
factory
be
covered
by
state
workmen's
comp?
