mr.
clement,
just
to
follow
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
if
there
is
a
helicopter
crash
in
the
water,
let's
say
it
occurs
2.5
miles
from
the
shore,
is
that
covered?
and
similarly
would
it
be
covered
if
it
occurred
3.5
miles
from
the
shore?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
clement,
you
are
asking
us
to
just
ignore
six
words
in
this
statute,
right?
you
read
the
statute
as
any
injury
occurring
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
when
in
fact
the
statute
says
"any
injury
occurring
as
a
result
of
operations
conducted
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
"
and
you
give
a
variety
of
arguments
in
your
brief
about
what
those
six
words
are
supposed
to
do.
they
are
supposed
to
cover
latent
injuries,
they
are
supposed
to
make
sure
that
the
statute
only
covers
things
that
happen
in
the
scope
of
your
employment.
but
your
friends
come
back
and
say
the
statute
did
all
those
things
anyway;
these
six
words
would
serve
no
function
under
your
theory.
justice
elena
kagan
this
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
she
asked
you
how
many
accountants
are
there
on
the
shelf?
one
can't
really
imagine
that
congress
is
writing
this,
this
statute,
and
drafting
those
six
words
in
order
to
make
sure
that
an
accountant
who
goes
out
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
isn't
covered.
justice

kagan
mr.
palmore--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
palmore,
you
are
asking
us
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
employment
and
the
shelf
activities,
and
the
statute
asks
us
to
look
at
the
relationship
between
the
injury
and
the
shelf
activities.
and
those
may
be
two
different
things
and
seemingly
are
two
different
things
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
gave
you.
justice
elena
kagan
the
back-up
positions
may
be
better
than
the
primary
positions
in
this
case,
you
know?
justice
elena
kagan
suppose,
mr.
frederick,
that
we
find
that
we
can't
find
your
status
test
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
then
what
this
statute
seems
to
give
us
is
instead
a
causal
test,
and
that
the
cause
is
whether
operations
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
caused
the
injury
in
question.
so
what's
your
best
argument
for
how
operations
on
the
shelf
caused
the
injury
in
this
case?
