justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
curious
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
statutory
language
seems
to
me
to
speak
quite
clearly
to
some
theory
of
causation.
any
injury
occurring
as
a
result
of
operations
conducted
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
that's
--
that's
causation.
maybe
it's
but-for,
maybe
it's
proximate,
but
it's
some
--
some
species
of
causation.
and
yet
nobody
wants
this
really
to
be
--
neither
you
nor
your
adversary
nor
the
government
wants
this
to
be
a
--
to
be
based
on
causation.
everyone
wants
to
smuggle
something
else
into
--
into
here
--
into
this.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
facts
of
this
case
were
changed
a
little
bit
so
that
the
respondent,
instead
of
spending
98
percent
of
his
time
on
an
oil
rig
doing
things
that
he
did
there,
actually
spent
only
20
percent
of
his
time
there
and
he
spent
80
percent
of
his
time
on
land
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
this
particular
operation
produced
so
much
scrap
metal
he
had
to
spend
80
percent
of
his
time
going
around
with
a
forklift
gathering
it
up.
now,
would
this
case
come
out
the
same
way
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
how
does
that
--
i
don't
see
how
you
get
this
result
out
of
the
statutory
language,
because
the
causal
connection
between
the
operations
on
the
shelf
and
the
accident
are
precisely
the
same
in
the
two
situations.
whether
he
spends
98
percent
of
his
time
on
the
rig
or
2
percent
of
his
time
on
the
rig,
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
in
the
causal
relationship.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
trouble
is
that
i
have
no
idea
what
that
means.
now,
they
have
the
example
of
an
accountant
on
land
who
spends
all
of
his
time
doing
accounting
work
for
the
--
for
the
oil
rig.
why
isn't
there
a
substantial
connection
there?
were
it
not
for
the
operations
on
the
oil
rig,
this
guy
would
be
out
of
work
or
he
would
be
doing
something
completely
different.
i
don't
understand
that.
