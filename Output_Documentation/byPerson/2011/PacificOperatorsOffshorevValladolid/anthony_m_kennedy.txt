but
--
but
if
you
had
said
status
or
situs,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
made
more
sense,
given
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
all
have
hypotheticals.
we
have
too
many,
but
it
--
it's
quite
common
on
oil
rigs
that
the
employees
bring
some
of
the
equipment
back
to
the
land,
clean
it,
prepare
it,
and
so
that
they
can
bring
it
back
to
the
next
--
the
next
shift
on
the
rig.
and
some
of
this
machinery
is
complicated.
it
has
springs
in
it.
and
suppose
that
the
worker
brings
the
machine
back
from
the
rig
to
the
land,
to
the
base
of
operations
that
is
land-based,
and
is
injured
in
repairing
that
machine?
under
your
view
no
coverage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
quite
difficult
to
square
with
the
"as
a
result"
language,
because
this
is
a
result
of
the
operation.
let's
just
say
the
machine
got
broken
because
of
the
--
of
the
operations,
and
there
--
and
he's
fixing
it
and
he's
injured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
the
government
--
the
government
and
the
ninth
circuit
take
care
of
that
by
saying
that
the
person
has
to
have
--
the
injured
employee
has
to
have
spent
substantial
amount
of
time
on
the
--
on
the
offshore
operations,
so
you
could
add
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree.
i
thought
you
had
a
back-up
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
your
--
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
call
status
--
if
the
test
is
where
you
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time
working,
is
that
what
you
call
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
but
you
call
that
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
brings
me
--
i
am
looking
at
petition
appendix
96
--
903(a)
that
you
referred
us
to.
i
wasn't
quite
sure
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
this
statute.
this
statute
is
a
situs-based
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
since
congress
didn't
follow
this
model
in
the
--
in
subsection
(b)
that
we
are
looking
for
and
used
"as
a
result",
why
doesn't
that
show
that
congress
meant
something
different?
i
didn't
hear
your
argument
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see,
in
other
words,
how
903
doesn't
hurt
you
more
than
it
helps
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
doesn't;
it
talks
about
where
the
injury
occurs,
and
that's
not
what
--
and
that's
not
what
(b)
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
--
do
the
courts
give
some
deference
to
the
director's
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
30
percent
over
the
time
of
his
career,
or
that
month
or
in
a
year?
