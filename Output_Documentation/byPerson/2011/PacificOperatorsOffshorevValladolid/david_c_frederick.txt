mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
shift
some
focus
to
what
would
have
happened
if
mr.
valladolid
had
worked
on
a
floating
platform
instead
of
a
fixed,
because
the
law
is
clear
that
if
the
platform
was
floating
he
would
be
a
jones
act
seaman,
and
under
this
court's
cases
if
he
were
injured
on
land
he
would
have
a
jones
act
remedy.
so
the
only
anomaly
here
is
that
he
happened
to
be
working
on
a
fixed
platform
98
percent
of
the
time
and
the
question
is
whether
the
permissive
workers'
compensation
benefits
provided
under
ocsla
carry
with
him
when
he
happens
to
be
injured
on
land
as
a
result
of
the
shelf
operations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
your
question,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
are
a
number
of
floating
platforms
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
they're
operating
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
as
well
as
on
the
western
pacific--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
point
is
that
they
get
a
jones
act
remedy
if
they
happen
to
be
injured
on
land.
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
under
your
hypothetical,
if
the
jones
act
seaman
is
driving
to
reno
and
there
is
an
accident,
he
is
covered
under
the
jones
act
and
gets
to
have
a
jones
act
remedy
notwithstanding
that
the
injury
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
service
on
the
vessel
itself.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
the
work
is
substantially
related
and
the
causal
connection
goes
to
the
employment
relationship
to
the
operations,
the
worker
is
covered
under
ocsla.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
to
be
sure
a
more
comfortable
fit
to
the
actual
language
of
the
statute
than
imposing
and
superimposing
a
situs-of-injury
requirement
which
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
section
1333(a).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
if
the
work
is
arising
out
of
the
course
and
scope
of
employment,
which
is
the
natural
way
that
these
workers'
compensation
regimes
work,
and
it
is
related
to
the
shelf
operations,
our
submission
is
yes,
he
is
covered
under
ocsla.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
--
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
the
easiest-to-administer
test,
too,
because
the
way
workers'
compensation
insurance
works,
the
employer
will,
based
on
the
payroll
of
the
workers
who
are
out
on
the
shelf
and
its
overall
payroll,
will
pay
workers'
compensation
premiums
and
under
the
department
of
labor
regulations
it
will
add
an
endorsement
for
those
workers
whose
status
it
controls,
would
be
covered
under
ocsla
and
thereby
get
the
higher
federal
benefit.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
our
submission
would
be
he
would
be
covered
because
he's
directly
injured
as
a
result
of
the
operations
on
the
shelf.
it's
a
factor--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that
person
is
going
to
be
covered
under
our
submission
because
it's
a
two-part
inquiry.
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
you
look
at
the
nature
of
how
the
injury
came
about,
and
under
those
circumstances
we
agree
with
the
government
that
if
somebody
is
--
if
an
employee
is
out
on
the
platform
and
is
injured
as
a
result
of
operations
that
person
is
covered.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
suggest
that
the
incongruity--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
even
greater
under
their
hypothetical
with
the
helicopter
worker,
because
they
want
to
get
the
person
who's
riding
in
the
helicopter
out
to
the
shelf
covered
under
the
longshore
act,
but
that
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
this
court's
holding
in
herb's
welding
that
when
he
is
on
the
fixed
platform,
he
doesn't
get
longshore
benefits.
and
so
here
under
their
hypothetical--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
under
his
submission,
his
submission
is
that
when
they
fly
out
on
a
helicopter
and
they
crash
in
the
water
they
get
longshore
benefits.
but
if
they
actually
made
it
to
the
platform
under
this
court's
holding
in
herb's
welding
they
would
not
get
longshore
benefits.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
they
were
in
state
territorial
waters.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
way
this
court
handled
that
under
in
seaman
context
under
chandris
was
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
the
worker's
employment,
and
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--he
would
be
covered.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
he's
the
kind
of
person
that
congress
would
want
to
provide
coverage
to
under
federal
worker
--
mind
--
remember,
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
actually
substantial
work.
we
don't
disagree
with
the
government's
adoption
of
a
chandris
30
percent
line.
that
seems
appropriate
in
light
of
the
fact
that
many
of
these
workers
come
on
for
two
weeks
and
off
for
two
weeks.
they
are
working
12-hour
shifts
while
they
are
out
on
the
rig.
it
seems
appropriate
that
the
coverage
should
go
with
them
when
they
are--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
what
the
--
the
government
--
i
have
no
brief
to
defend,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
terms
of
where
that
line
is,
because
my
client's
husband--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
point
that
congress
is
trying
to
get
at
--
and
these
are
platforms
that
were
covered
by
state
workers'
compensation
in
1953
--
was
to
extend
the
more
generous
federal
benefits
to
encourage
an
industry
that
was
a
nascent
industry
to
develop
the
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf,
to
provide
uniformity,
to
provide
benefits
to
the
workers
who
were
exposed
to
the
perils
that
were
out
on
the
platform,
so
it
makes
sense,
we
submit,
that
when
those
workers
who
are
subjected
to
those
circumstances
have
the
same
federal
benefits.
and
they
are
substantial
benefits.
my
client,
for
instance,
got
a
one-time
lump
sum
payment
of
$42,000
for
the
death
of
her
husband,
as
opposed
to
the
federal
benefits
that
would
be
approximately
$466
per
week
during
the
remainder
of
her
period
as
a
widow,
and
the
state
benefits
would
be
credited
against
any
federal
benefits
that
she
would
be
getting
in
the
future.
but
it's
--
it
is
a
substantial
dimension
to
the
life
of
a
worker
out
on
the
shelf.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
scrap
metal
that
mr.
valladolid
was
charged
with
moving
at
the
time
of
his
the
death
was
very
likely
the
same
scrap
metal
that
he
personally
had
taken
off
the
shelf,
or
someone
in
his
position
would
have
taken
off
the
shelf.
and
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
the
equipment
is
heavy,
dangerous,
difficult
equipment.
just
the
fact
that
it
is
moved
off
the
shelf
for
a
cleaning
--
scrap,
for
removal,
et
cetera,
is
an
immaterial
difference.
in
their
reply
brief,
they
concede
that
an
oil
spill
worker
who's
cleaning
up
the
oil
spill
from
an
offshore
event
is
going
to
be
covered
under
a
--
what
they
call
a
proximate
cause
standard
--
under
any
kind
of
substantial
connection
proximate
cause.
proximate
cause
is
a
legal
policy
that
determines
how
you
want
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
injuries
that
would
be
covered.
in
a
workers'
compensation
scheme,
justice
scalia,
you
are
completely
right
it
makes
no
sense.
and
so
if
you
adopt
some
kind
of
substantial
connection,
it
has
to
be
very
loosely
related.
as
the
court
in
the
fela
context
last
term
held
in
csx
v.
mcbride,
where
you
have
a
negligence
standard,
it
makes
even
more
sense
to
have
a
very
relaxed
standard
of
causation
under
workers'
compensation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
have
to
be
an
employee.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
has
to
be
an
employee.
if
--
if
--
your
hypothetical
is
the
independent
contractor
on
land,
it
has
to
be
an
employee
in
order
to
be
covered.
and
that
person
doesn't
qualify,
which
creates
another
set
of
difficult
lines
to
draw
under
the
longshore
act,
where
you
also
have
to
be
an
employee,
and
independent
contractors
are
not
covered.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
you
could
give
me
the
rest
of
the
facts
of
your
hypothetical,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
not
covered,
because
that
person
is
not
directly
substantially
working
on
shelf
operations--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
because
those
workers,
those
workers
--
i
think
it's
hard
to
imagine
the
kinds
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--this
court's
articulation
of
that
standard,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
chandris
test
has
been
the
subject
of
litigation
in
the
lower
courts,
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
courts
have
kind
of
worked
out
the
various
factors
and
standards
that
go
into
the
nature
of
the
employment
standard--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
and
the
nature
--
you
know,
if
i
could
--
i'm
sorry,
did
you
want--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
i
understand
the
case
law,
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
a
range
of
factors
that
go
into
the
nature
of
the
sea
workers'
relationship
to
the
vessel,
and
they
go
to
--
they
go
to
duration,
they
go
to
the
performance
of
duties
in
the
completion
of
the
mission
of
the
vessel
and
the
like.
and
there
are
a
range
of
standards.
obviously,
the
facts
of
each
crew
member
is
difficult
to
unpack
in
a
hypothetical
at
this
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
chief
justice
--
and
i
don't
represent
the
insurance
company
here
--
but
the
way
i
understand
that
it
works
is
that
on
an
annual
or
on
a
periodic
basis,
the
company
and
the
insurance
company
get
together
through
some
auditing
process
where
there
is
verification
of
the
workers
who
are
ocsla
workers
and
thereby
get
the
longshore
benefits,
and
the
company
and
the
insurance
company
work
that
out
to
determine
either
numbers
or
particular
individuals
or
the
like.
and
so
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
not
liable
for
the
damage.
it's
an
insured
risk,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's
a
different
form
of
liability
and
it's
one
that
based
on
the
way
workers'
compensation
is
traditionally
developed
--
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
opening
chapters
of
larson's
monumental
treatise
on
workers'
compensation,
where
he
basically
says
if
this
is
a
social
compact
in
which
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
face
liability
for
personal
injuries
in
tort,
but
gets
insurance
and
the
premiums
are
then
passed
on
to
the
consuming
public
of
that
particular
entity's
goods.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
under
this
statute,
no,
(b)(2),
as
justice
sotomayor
referenced,
it
is
--
it
is
an
employer,
some
of
whose
employees
are
engaged
in
"such
operations".
and
mr.
valladolid
was
exactly
the
kind
of
person
who
was
engaged
in
such
operations.
so
our
submission,
justice
breyer,
is
that
that
is
the
kind
of
person
that
congress
contemplated
when
it
was
focusing
on
the
workforce
that
would
be
engaged
in
the
development
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
put
it
this
way,
the
pushback
for
the
but-for
test
in
its
broadest
sense
is
that
there
isn't
a
natural
kind
of
a
way
of
confining
some
restriction
to
it.
and
so
if
you
look
at
the
statute
in
terms
of
what
it
naturally
must
have
meant
by
congress,
there
is
a
natural
limit,
and
it
is
not
just
complete
but-for
causation,
but
there
are
an
effort
--
there
is
an
effort
to
try
to
restrict
the
scope
of
the
compensation.
