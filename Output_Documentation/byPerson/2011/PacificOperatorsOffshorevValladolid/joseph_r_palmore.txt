mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
off
with
the
exchange
that
justice
kagan
had
with
mr.
clement
about
the
language
that
was
used
here
in
1333(b),
and
i
think
the
contrast
between
the
language
that
congress
used
in
1333(b)
and
the
language
it
used
in
other
provisions,
neighboring
provisions
of
1333,
is
instructive.
and
i
would
like
the
point
the
court
to
section
1333(c),
which
is
on
page
3(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
this
is
the
provision
involving
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
i
think
this
shows
how
congress
went
about
drafting
when
it
wanted
to
specify
legal
consequences
that
would
flow
from
an
actual
event
that
took
place
in
a
particular
place.
so
congress
extends
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
any
unfair
labor
practice
as
defined
in
such
act
occurring
upon
any
artificial
island.
and
it
lists
with
particularity
the
particular
situses
where
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
apply.
if
congress
had
followed
that
model
in
section
1333(b)
it
would
be
a
very
different
statute.
it
would
have
said,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
with
respect
to
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
resulting
from
any
injury
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
if
congress
wanted
to
additionally
require
--
have
some
kind
of
operations
nexus,
it
could
have
said
occurring
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
as
the
result
of
operations
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
congress
didn't
do
either
of
those
things
in
section
1333(b),
and
we
think
that
contrast
is
--
is
quite
instructive
here.
it's
also
not
the
case--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
think
that,
mr.
chief
justice
that,
i
think
there
is
a
contrast
between
1333(b)
and
1333(c)
in
terms
of
the
specificity
with
which
congress
provided
for
where
a
particular
event
would
happen.
there
is
no
question
that
1333(b)
has
a
situs
requirement,
but
it
is
a
situs
of
operations
requirement.
so
when
you
are
talking
about
a
situs
of
operations,
you
are
talking
about
a
geographic
zone
where
operations
take
place,
it
makes
sense
that
congress
would
have
used
this
phrase
"on
the
outer
continental
shelf".
now,
the
outer
continental
shelf
itself
is
a
defined
term
in
the
statutes.
in
1335(a)
it
applies
only
to
the
subsoil
and
seabed.
it
doesn't
include
artificial
installations
put
on
top.
so
we
are
talking
about
a
general
zone,
a
general
geographic
zone
where
the
operations
take
place,
and
then
congress
wanted
to
provide
benefits
for
injuries
that
result
from
those
operations.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
because
we
think
it's
a
mistake
in
the
context
of
a
workers'
compensation
scheme
to
look
at
this
as
kind
of
a
snapshot
in
time.
we
think
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
workers'
compensation
scheme,
the
kind
of
causation
that
is
relevant
is
the
causation
caused
by
the
employment
relationship
itself.
so
if
someone's
spending,
like
mr.
valladolid,
is
spending
98
percent
of
his
time
on
the
shelf,
he
is
he's
uniquely
exposed
to
the
hazards
of
work
in
that
dangerous
environment.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
and
we
think
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--he
does
have
to
be
an
employee.
that's
a
--
only
employees
are
entitled
to
benefits.
but
i
think
the
definition
of
"employee"
or
really
the
related
definition
of
"employer"
is
instructive
on
this
question.
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
1333(b)(2),
this
is
on
page
3a
of
the
government
appendix,
the
term
"employer"
means
"an
employer
any
of
whose
employees
are
employed
in
such
operations.
"
it's
somewhat
of
a
circular
definition,
but
there's
a
focus
here
on
employees
who
are
engaged
in
such
operations.
those
are
employees
like
mr.--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--and
the
ninth
circuit
viewed
--
viewed
injury
in
the
way
that
your
honor
and
justice
alito
are
suggesting.
and
i
would
--
and
that
is
our
back-up
position.
i
think
both
sides
here
have
back-up
positions.
i
would
submit
that
the
back-up
positions
are
where--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
the
back-up
positions
really
also
differ
with
each
other
only
in
a
matter
of
degree,
not--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
don't
--
to
be
clear,
we
don't
think
it's
better.
we
think
that
the
category
of
off-shelf
injuries
that
should
be
covered
are
those
that
are
suffered
by
workers
who
spend
a
substantial
amount
of
time
on
the
shelf.
the
back-up
position
is
the,
in
our
view,
is
the
ninth
circuit
position,
which
is
the
substantial
connection
between
the
injury
and
operations
on
the
shelf.
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
that
different
from
mr.
clement's
back-up
position.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
that's
the
--
that
would
be
an
expansive
but-for
test
of
the
kind
that
at
least
some
language
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
curtis
would
support.
we
think
that
that
sweeps
too
broadly.
we
think
a
proximate
cause,
however,
sweeps
too
narrowly,
and
justice
scalia's
exchange
with
mr.
clement
highlighted
this.
proximate
cause
is
a--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--we
think
substantial,
substantial
nexus,
substantial
connection.
we
think,
though,
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
look
at
only
the
snapshot
in
time.
there
is
some
language
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
--
which
might
suggest
that.
we
think--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
think
i
would
submit
that
it
is
from
the
language,
justice
sotomayor,
because
we
think
that
the
language
has
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
workers'
compensation.
this
is
not
a
tort-based
fault
regime.
this
is
a
workers'
compensation
scheme.
workers'
compensation
schemes
are
based
on
the
relationship
between
employer
and
employee,
and
they
cover
injuries
that
arise
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment.
so
the
kind
of
causation
that
matters
in
a
workers'
compensation
scheme
is
the
causation
that
flows
from
the
worker
relationship
itself,
the
workplace
relationship
itself.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
that
is
the
second
point.
i
think
that
textual
provision
provides
support
for
the
fact
that
congress
was
particularly
focused
on
those
employees
who
were
uniquely
exposed
to
the
hazards
of
work
on
the
shelf.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
think
he
is
because
that
is
a
worker
who
is
uniquely
exposed
to
those
hazards
offshore
and
he
shouldn't--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes,
your
honor,
because
we
think
that
--
and
here
the
contrast
with
the
underlying
longshore
act
is
important
and
justice
kennedy's
questions
of
justice
--
of
mr.
clement
highlighted
this.
it's
quite
an
unusual
thing
for
a
workers'
compensation
statute
to
have
a
situs-of-injury
requirement.
the
longshore
act
is
the
sole
example
of
which
i'm
aware,
and
it
has
it
for
historical
reasons
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
jensen.
and
it
has
a
provision
that
is
quoted
on
page
19
of
the
government
brief,
that
provides
coverage
for
disability
or
death,
but
only
if
the
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters.
that
was
clearly
in
front
of
congress
at
the
time
that
it
adopted
ocsla,
because
it
was
incorporating
that
statute
and
applying
it
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
context.
and
it's
quite
telling
that
congress
did
not
use
that
but-only-if
formulation.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes,
in
some
situations.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
because
the
kind
of
certainty
--
we
think
our
test
is
actually
much
easier
to
administer
and
provides
greater
predictability
in
this
sense.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
there's
--
congress
contemplated,
expressly
contemplated,
that
there
would
be
overlapping
coverage
and
adopted
a
provision
in
903(e)
of
the
longshore
act
to
provide
for
offsetting
payments
when
there
is
overlap.
overlap
is
a
fact
of
life
in
this
area.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
in
this
case
the
federal
benefits
were
more
generous
than
the
state
benefits.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
would
not.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
because
we
thought
that
congress
intended
this
to
function
in
the
way
that
other
workers'
compensation
schemes
function,
both
at
the
time
that
ocsla
was
adopted
and
today,
which
is
that
the
coverage
provides
comprehensive
benefits
from
the
start
of
the
work
day
to
the
end
of
the
work
day.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
under
the
longshore
act,
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
because
in
that
situation,
justice
breyer,
the
longshore
act's
strict
situs-of-injury
requirement
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule.
that
is
unusual
and
really
unprecedented
in
imposing
a
situs-of-injury
requirement
in
the
context
of
a
workers'
compensation
scheme.
at
the
time
of
ocsla
--
at
the
time
ocsla
was
adopted
in
1953,
states
had
nearly
uniformly
moved
away
from
the
tort
theory
of
workers'
compensation
coverage
that
would
apply
benefits--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
we
do
know
why.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it
was
stingy
for
historical
reasons--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--it
was
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
jensen,
and
there
is
a
whole
long
and
tortured
history
there,
and
that
explains
why
congress
did
that.
but
when
congress
took
the
unusual
step
of
imposing
a
situs-of-injury
requirement
in
the
context
of
a
workers'
compensation
scheme,
it
did
so
in
express
terms
with
this
"but
only
if"--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes,
just
like
the
worker
on
a
fixed
platform
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
would
also
be
covered
by
state
workers'
comp.
private
respondent
cites
the
bobbitt
case
from
california
that
says
california
workers'
comp
doesn't
have
a
--
location
requirement--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
overlap
--
a
certain
degree
of
overlap
is
a
fact
of
life
in
this
area.
section
903(e)
accounts
for
that
by
allowing
for
offsetting
payment,
so
there
is
--
never
going
to
be
double
recovery,
and
903(e)
really
just
endorsed
the
historical
practice
of
offsetting
payments
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
the
calbeck
case.
so
that
there
has
always
been
some
degree
of
overlapping
coverage.
at
the
time
of
--
ocsla
was
adopted
in
1953,
this
court
in
davis
had
recognized
that
even
under
the
longshore
act
itself
there
was
a
twilight
zone
of
overlapping
coverage.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
you
--
you
might
proceed
under
either
one
if
you
are
covered
by
either
one,
but
what
is
quite,
justice
scalia,
is
you
can't
collect--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--under
either
one,
or
if
you
do,
you
--
there
are
going
to
be
contingent
offsets.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
in
this
court's
decision
in
rambo,
the
court
said
that
the
director's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
entitled
to
skidmore
deference.
