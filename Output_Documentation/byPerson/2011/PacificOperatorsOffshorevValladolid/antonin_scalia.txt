justice
antonin
scalia
give
--
give
me
an
example
of
a
--
of
an
injury
that
occurs
on
the
shelf
that
is
not
a
consequence
of
operations
conducted.
what
--
just
beachcombers
out
there,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
they
doing
out
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
i
don't
really
understand
proximate
cause
as
applied
to
a
--
a
statute
that
provides
for
automatic
liability
rather
than
liability
for
negligence.
to
say
that
it's
a
proximate
cause
of
a
particular
act
of
negligence
is
one
thing
and
we
have
a
whole
body
of
law
that
gives
guidance
for
that.
but
do
you
know
of
any
other
situation
where
we
talk
of
proximate
cause,
something
proximately
caused
by
operations?
not
by
a
particular
act
of
negligence
or
--
i
don't
know
how
to
apply
proximate
cause
to
an
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
reason
did
they
have
to
use
the
--
the
terminology
"as
a
result
of"
instead
of
simply
saying
that
this
act
applies
only
with
regard
to
injuries
on
the
platform,
which
is
what
other
statutes
did
say?
i
mean,
other
statutes
had
a
geographical
requirement.
what
a
strange
way
to
say
it,
"as
a
result
of
operations".
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
with
that
is
it's
not
what
it
says.
it
says
"as
a
result
of
operations".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
you
know,
i
would
think
he
doesn't
even
have
to
be
an
employee,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
back-up
position
that
is
so
much
better
here?
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
mr.
clement
says
that
--
and
we
can
argue
about
whether
the
language
does
it
or
not,
but
the
system
he
comes
up
with
he
says
creates
a
very
sensible
division.
you're
either
under
the
longshore
act
or
you're
under
this
act.
and
whereas
in
your
situation,
you
can
be
under
both,
can't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
one
prevails
when
they
both
apply?
are
there
any
differences
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
--
when
you
are
covered
by
both
the
longshore
act
and
state
workmens'
comp,
can
you
provide
under
either
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
get
over--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
think
you
could
proceed
under
the
state
law
if
you
choose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
an
anomaly.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
it's
a
floating
platform
it's
a
vessel.
it's
the
difference
between
a
vessel
and
a
dock.
is
it
an
anomaly
that
you
are
--
you
are
covered
under
the
longshore
act
if
you
are
injured
on
a
dock,
which
is
fixed,
but
you
are
not
--
you're
covered
under
the
jones
act
instead
if
you
are
on
a
vessel,
which
is
not
fixed?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
an
anomaly
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
floating
platforms
are
there,
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
covered
by
the
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
should
be;
they're
vessels.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you
are
not
proposing
to
eliminate
that
anomaly?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
wherever
you
are
injured,
so
long
as
you
are
on
a
--
a
platform
you
are
--
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
still
have
an
anomaly.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
it
will
be
covered;
sometimes
it
won't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
work
only
20
percent
of
your
time
for
this
--
this
drilling
company
on
--
on
the
--
on
the
platform
but
it
so
happens
that
you
are
injured
on
the
platform,
you
know,
a
bolt
comes
off
and
strikes
you,
you
are
not
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
you
are
not
applying
the
--
the
employment
test.
i
mean,
you
either
are
or
you
are
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose,
right?
we
--
we
--
we
have
a
situs-of-the-injury
test
when
you
have
less
than
your
--
a
majority
of
your
work
on
the
platform,
but
we
don't
have
a
situs
test
when
the
majority
is
on
the
platform.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
the
longshore
act?
i
--
i
thought
--
i
thought
it
was
the
jones
act
that
they
were
covered
in
the
helicopter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
if
--
i
assume
that
the
act
would
also
apply
under
your
analysis
to
a
--
an
independent
contractor,
a
trucker,
who
carries
this
heavy
--
heavy
steel
to
the
place
where
this
worker
worked
on
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
would
not
be
carrying
the
steel
had
it
not
been
for
the
--
for
the
operations
on
the
shelf.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
be
covered
if
--
if
--
he
were
employed
by
the
--
by
the
firm
that
operates
the
platform,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
--
it's
just
the
guy
that
drives
the
truck
that
takes
the
steel
to
the
place
where
your
client
worked
on
it.
