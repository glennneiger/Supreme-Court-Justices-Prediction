justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner
operates
two
oil
platforms
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
off
the
coast
of
california,
one
by
valladolid,
one
of
petitioner's
employees
spent
most
of
his
time
working
on
one
of
these
offshore
platforms,
but
he
was
killed
in
an
accident
while
working
at
petitioner's
onshore
facility.
valladolid's
widow,
the
respondent
here,
sought
workers'
compensation
benefits
pursuant
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
the
lands
act
extends
the
workers'
compensation
coverage
provided
by
another
statute,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
to
injuries
occurring
as
a
result
of
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
natural
resources.
an
administrative
law
judge
dismissed
the
respondent's
claim
reasoning
that
the
lands
act
did
not
cover
valladolid's
fatal
injury
because
his
accident
occurred
on
land
rather
than
on
the
shelf.
the
labor
department's
benefit
review
board
affirmed.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
concluding
that
the
lands
act
did
not
incorporate
a
strict
geographic
restriction,
but
rather
required
a
substantial
nexus
between
a
worker's
injury
and
his
employer's
extractive
operations
on
the
shelf.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
we
reject
the
petitioner's
argument
that
the
lands
act
extends
longshore
act
coverage
only
to
employees
whose
injuries
occur
on
the
shelf.
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
lands
act
supports
such
a
restriction.
the
statute
has
only
two
requirements,
the
employer's
extractive
operations
must
be
conducted
on
the
shelf
and
the
employee's
injury
must
occur
as
a
result
of
those
operations.
had
congress
intended
to
limit
the
scope
of
lands
act
coverage
solely
to
injuries
that
occur
on
the
shelf
then
congress
could
have
easily
done
so
as
demonstrated
by
the
explicit
geographic
restrictions
that
appear
in
other
subsections
of
the
act.
we
are
also
unpersuaded
by
petitioner's
alternative
argument
which
requires
a
nonintuitive
reading
of
the
lands
act
in
light
of
other
unrelated
provisions
in
the
longshore
act.
we
find
it
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
restrict
the
scope
of
--
of
the
lands
act
workers'
compensation
scheme
through
the
convoluted
combination
of
two
separate
legislative
acts.
instead,
we
conclude
that
the
substantial
nexus
test
faithfully
interprets
the
text
of
the
lands
act.
we
understand
that
test
to
require
an
injured
employee
to
establish
a
significant
causal
link
between
his
injury
and
his
employer's
extractive
operations
on
the
shelf
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
workers'
compensation
benefits
under
the
lands
act.
whether
an
injured
employee
qualifies
for
lands
act
coverage
will
depend
on
the
specific
circumstances
of
his
case.
it
was
thus
proper
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
remand
this
case
for
the
benefits
review
board
to
apply
the
substantial
nexus
test
to
the
circumstances
presented
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
alito
joins.
