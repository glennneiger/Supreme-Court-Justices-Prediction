how
many
accountants
go
to
platforms?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
that
--
if
that's
what
congress
meant,
then
the
emphasis
should
be
on
is
this
person
one
who
regularly
works
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
--
this
worker
we're
told
was
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
98
percent
of
the
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
brief,
your
reply
brief,
said
you
--
you
superimpose
a
status
test.
you
have
the
situs
of
the
injury
and
then
you
superimpose
status.
so
your
test
is
not
simple
state
of
--
place
of
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
if
your
position
is
right
then
we
have
a
worker
who
most
of
the
time
is
doing
work
on
a
platform
and
he
will
be
covered
or
not
depending
on
whether
the
injury
occurred
on
the
shelf
or
on
the
land.
so
it's
--
the
other
view
is
to
say,
what
this
person
does
most
of
the
time
is
what
counts.
then
this
worker
would
always
be
covered
by
ocsla
and
if
you
take
your
view,
then
one
will
be
covered
by
ocsla,
and
another
one
who
is
doing
the
same
job
is
covered
by
a
state
--
a
state
--
you
have
a
variety
of
state
workers'
compensation
laws
as
opposed
to
a
uniform
law
governing
workers
of
this
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
may
i
go
back
to
--
you
referred
to
herb's
welding,
but
that
was
a
case
--
it
was
a
claim
under
the
longshore
act,
not
an
ocsla
claim,
and
the
court
said
it
was
expressing
no
opinion
on
whether
1332(b)
covered
the
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
also
did
not
adopt
the
proposal,
the
specific
proposal
to
confine
ocsla
to
situations
in
which
state
workers'
compensation
was
unavailable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
injury
on
land
in
the
course
of
employment
that
would
not
be
covered
by
ocsla
where
we
have
a
worker
of
this
kind
who
spends
98
percent
of
his
time
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
--
the
injury,
however,
is
on
land?
is
there
any
case
where
such
a
worker
who
predominantly
works
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
would
not
be
covered
by
ocsla
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
what
you
are
really
saying
is
--
it's
not
your
test
but
maybe
the
government
saying
we
look
to
see,
is
this
person
dominantly
working
on
the
outer
continental
shelf?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
are
talking
about
the
chandris
standard
that
that
--
the
seaman's
relationship
to
the
vessel
must
be
substantial
in
nature
and
duration--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that's
a
kind
of
a
vague
--
what
is
substantial
is
the
problem
we
have
here?
what
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
so
how
have
courts
worked
this
out?
what
is
a
substantial
relation
to
the
vessel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
doesn't
congress
know?
because
i
think
states
overwhelmingly
would
include
outer
continental
shelf
workers
in
their
compensation
scheme.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
make
sense
to
use
the
longshore
act
because
they
would
have
the
same
level
of
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
they
wanted
the
ocsla
worker
to
have
the
same
benefits
as
the
longshore
worker.
