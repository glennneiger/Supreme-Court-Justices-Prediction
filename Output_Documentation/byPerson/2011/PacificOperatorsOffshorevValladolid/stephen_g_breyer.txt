justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the
question
is,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
wouldn't
they
have
been
--
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
if
a
person
of
a
certain
set
--
it's
the
same
set
in
both,
virtually,
the
same
set
of
people
--
where
they
are
injured
on
navigable
waters
or
piers
and
docks
and
so
forth,
it's
the
longshore
act.
and
if
you
are
on
the
platform,
it's
this
act,
so
far.
and
the
benefits
are
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
only
thing
that
extending
this
does,
i
think
he
says,
is
imagine
a
person
who
worked
on
a
platform
goes
to
get
some
platform
bits
repaired
miles
from
the
sea.
now,
that
person
would
not
be
covered
by
longshore
act,
would
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
and
he
would
be
covered
by
this
if
they're
right,
but
not
if
clement
is
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
he's
saying
what
point
was
there
for
congress
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
give
you
an
example.
it
might
help.
a
longshoreman
is
working
on
a
dock.
someone
tells
him:
there
is
a
winch
here
that
is
broken;
take
it
to
the
plant
to
have
it
repaired,
which
is
100
miles
inland.
he
does
it,
and
he's
hurt
at
the
plant.
he
is
not
covered,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right.
so
he's
not
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
the
same
thing
happens
on
the
platform,
under
your
theory
he
is
covered.
now,
your
opponent
is
asking
a
reasonable
question.
that
seems
to
be
about
the
only
difference
that
he
can
think
of,
whether
it's
the
one
act
or
the
other,
and
why
would
congress
have
done
that?
that's
his
question,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
is
basically
there
are
many
statutes
like
this,
they
all
have
some
kind
of
ocsla
type
requirement,
it's
the
longshore
act
that
was
rather
stingy,
and
we
don't
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
of
the
workmen's
compensation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
carry
over
who
is
an
employee
from
the
longshoreman
act,
which
defines
an
employee
as
a
maritime
worker,
and
then
defines
that
as
exceptions
and
so
forth
and
this
has
a
couple
more.
that's
who
the
employee
is,
right?
