mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
straightforward
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
provides
a
remedy
for
a
worker
injured
in
a
forklift
mishap
on
dry
land.
the
answer
is
no.
a
worker
injured
on
dry
land
from
operations
on
dry
land
has
a
remedy
in
the
state
workers'
compensation
law,
but
not
from
ocsla's
extension
of
the
longshore
act
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
indeed,
both
the
benefits
review
board
and
the
ninth
circuit
here
held
that
the
accident
occurred
too
far
inland
for
direct
coverage
under
the
longshore
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
it
wouldn't
count
as
land,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
were
platforms
on
there
that
were
themselves
treated
as
land,
that
might
be.
i
think
most
of
the
3
miles
from
shore
is
going
to
be
the
navigable
waters
and
that
might
be
covered,
for
example,
directly
under
the
longshore
act.
but
as
i
say,
one
of
the
anomalies
here
is
there
was
a
direct
longshore
act
involvement
in
this
case,
and
the
determination
was
that
the
facility
here
was
too
far
inland
for
direct
coverage
under
the
longshore
act.
so
therefore,
the
counterintuitive
proposition
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
today
is
that
in
extending
the
longshore
act
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
congress
effectively
created
a
boomerang
effect
that
caused
the
longshore
act
to
apply
further
inland
than
it
otherwise
would.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i
think
the
best
answer
is
both
of
those
crashes
would
be
covered
directly
by
the
longshore
act
because
the
longshore
act
by
its
own
terms,
not
extended
by
ocsla,
covers
the
navigable
waters,
and
both
of
those
would
be
accidents
occurring
in
the
navigable
waters.
and
in
the
part
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
pacific
operators
case
addressing
the
dosa
claim,
this
court
said
that
a
helicopter
effectively
when
it's
performing
this
kind
of
ferrying
function
is
a
vessel.
so
i
would
think
that
the
right
answer
there
is
not
that
ocsla
extends
the
longshore
act,
but
the
longshore
act
applies
directly
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
let
me
talk
first
about
the
causation
and
then
about
the
smuggling
if
i
can.
as
to
the
causation,
i
think
there
is
both
causation
in
this
1333(b)
and
a
situs
requirement
that
both
sides
acknowledge.
at
a
bare
minimum,
there
has
to
be
injuries
resulting
from
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf.
and
i
think
that
alone,
that
causation
principle
alone,
if
faithfully
applied,
is
enough
to
decide
this
case
in
our
favor.
but
let
me
address
the
smuggling,
because
i
do
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
best
example
would
be,
your
honor,
is
somebody
who's
on
the
shelf
but
they
are
not
employed
in
the
relevant
production
purposes.
and
so
you
might
have--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
you
might
have
an
accountant
out
there.
you
might
just
have
some
employees
who
are
out
there
whale
watching
or
something.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
worth
recognizing
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
many
go.
i
doubt
very
many
go.
but
congress
passed
this
statute
at
a
time
where
they
didn't
know
the
full
scope
of
the
operations
that
would
take
place
out
on
the
shelf.
and
so
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
they
are
trying
to
--
at
the
one
point
they
are
trying
to
limit
it
to
employees
who
are
engaged
in
the
operations
out
there
that
are
designed
for
the
production
of
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
shelf.
and
so
i
think
that's
what
some
of
the
language
is
directed
at--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
and
if
he
was
at
the
--
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
at
the
time
of
this
accident,
he
probably
wouldn't
have
been
injured.
but
the
one
thing
i
think
the
statute
clearly
speaks
to
is
not
status,
but
it
speaks
to,
as
justice
alito
suggested,
at
a
minimum
a
relationship
between
the
operations
that
caused
the
injury
and
the
fact
that
those
operations
have
to
be
conducted
on
the
shelf.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no
coverage,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
disagree,
your
honor,
respectfully,
and
i
think
your
way
of
looking
at
that
hypothetical
doesn't
give
sufficient
import
to
the
phrase
"conducted
on
the
shelf".
it's
--
what
respondents
want
to
do
is
they
want
you
to
look
at
the
statute
as
saying
as
long
as
there
is
an
injury
that
results
from
operations
that
have
the
purpose
of
developing
the
outer
continental
shelf,
that
that's
enough.
and
if
that
were
enough
i
think
the
answer
to
your
hypothetical
would
be
that's
covered.
but
the
statute
very
specifically
says
that
they
have
to
be
injuries
as
a
result
of
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
shelf.
and
so
that
first
"on
the
shelf"
i
think
clearly
modifies
the
operations.
only
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf
are
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
you
can't
add
that,
your
honor,
because
if
there's
one
thing
that
is
absolutely
clear
about
this
statute
it's
that
it
doesn't
include
a
status
test
that
looks
for
the
predominant
place
you
spend
your
time.
and
that's
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
i
mean,
i
have
two
arguments
and
let
me
try
to
address
both,
which
is
to
say,
on
the
causation
point,
if
you
look
at
just
causation
and
you
don't
have
a
site
and
a
status
requirement,
then
in
that
scenario
there
is
no
way
to
get
just
the
status
test.
and
the
only
thing
i
would
implore
you
to
think
about
in
that
is,
not
only
is
it
not
in
the
statute,
but
there
is
a
statute
that
has
a
status-based
remedy
that
travels
with
the
worker
wherever
they
go.
it's
the
jones
act
and
it
specifically
is
written
in
status
terms.
and
that
was
a
model
that
congress
had
before
it,
but
it
specifically
rejected
the
admiralty
model
for
dealing
with
these
structures
and
adopted
the
model
that
has
them
treated
as
land--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
their
status
test,
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
call
that
their
pure
status
test,
which
they
themselves
cite
to
chandris,
which
is
a
jones
act
case.
that
just
doesn't
work.
this
was
not
the
jones
act.
now,
there
is
a
test
where
we
say
that
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
is
status
plus
situs.
and
if
i
try
to
get
this
argument
out,
it's
a
little
bit
complicated,
because
i
think
the
defect
of
this
argument,
if
it
has
one,
is
it
doesn't
directly
leap
out
directly
from
1333(b)
you
have
to
read
1333(b)
in
conjunction
with
both
the
rest
of
1333
and
in
conjunction
with
903(a)
of
the
longshoreworkers'
act.
if
you
do
that,
i
think
you
will
see
there
is
a
situs
requirement
and
a
status
requirement.
let
me
start
with
the
rest
of
the
1333.
if
you
think
about
the
statute,
the
primary
engine
for
applying
federal
law
to
the
shelf
is
not
1333(b),
it's
1333(a).
it
applies
all
the
federal
law
to
the
shelf.
but
some
statutes,
it
doesn't
work
and
the
longshore
act
is
one
of
them.
if
you
apply
the
longshore
act
to
the
shelf
without
any
modifications,
it
won't
cover
the
shelf
because
it
by
its
terms
has
a
situs
requirement
that
is
limited
to
the
navigable
waters
and
at
that
point
the
drydocks.
so
congress
has
to
tailor
the
longshore
remedy
to
the
reality
of
the
shelf
and
it
does
it
in
two
ways.
one,
it
has
this
language
that
everyone's
focused
on
that
is
something
of
a
status
requirement
in
that
it
limits
the
recovery
to
employees
who
are
engaged
in
certain
activities,
but
the
rest
of
the
language
in
1333(b)
is
important.
it's
these
definitions
1,
2,
and
3,
and
they
effectively
define
terms
in
the
longshore
act
to
make
them
work
for
purposes
of
extending
it
to
the
shelf.
and
the
key
definition
is
3.
3
defines
the
term
"united
states"
when
used
in
the
geographical
sense,
and
it
defines
it
to
include
the
shelf,
the
artificial
islands,
and
the
fixed
attachments
thereto.
now,
that's
a
puzzle
if
you
look
at
1333(b)
in
isolation,
because
it's
defining
the
term
1333(b)
does
not
use
the
term
"united
states"
for
geographical
purposes.
but
another
statute
does;
it's
903.
it's
the
longshore
remedy
that's
extended.
and
903(a)
uses
the
term
"united
states".
and
903(a)
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
is
at
page
96
of
the
petition
appendix.
but
that's
the
situs
requirement.
the
the
situs
requirement
of
903(a)
unmodified
limits
recovery
to
the
navigable
waters
and
drydocks.
so
if
you
take
that
definition
from
(b)(3)
and
essentially
superimpose
it
on
903(a),
you
then
get
a
remedy
that
has
a
situs
requirement;
there's
a
recovery,
but
only
if
the
injury
occurs
on
the
navigable
waters,
drydocks,
the
shelf,
artificial
islands,
and
the
attachments
there
to.
so
it's
--
as
i
say,
it's
a
complicated
argument
and
it
doesn't
stare
you
in
the
face
if
you
look
at
1333(b)--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
--
with
respect,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
you
get
that
without
ocsla,
which
is
to
say
i
think
that
there
is
a
remedy
under
the
longshore
act
directly
under
the
adjacent
waters
because
the
adjacent
waters
are
navigable
waters.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
don't
need
those,
and
that
just
underscores
that
congress
in
the
statute
is
really
dealing
with
a
very
particular
problem
with
the
shelf
and
the
artificial
islands
and
platforms
attached
to
them.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
same
way,
your
honor,
which
is
saying
they
are
navigable
waters.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly,
and
they're
not.
the
statute
i
think
couldn't
be
clearer
about
that
because
1332--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
if
i
could
take
that,
there's
a
couple
of
pieces
to
that,
justice
sotomayor.
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
the
hypothetical,
let's
say,
of
a
nut
or
something
coming
off
the
shelf
and
hitting
somebody
somewhere
else
is
--
illustrates
the
difference
between
our
primary
argument
and
our
back-up
argument.
on
a
primary,
somebody
00
if
the
nut
hits
somebody
in
the
navigable
waters,
they
wouldn't
recover
from
ocsla;
they
would
recover
under
the
longshore
act
directly
because
they
were
on
the
navigable
waters.
on
our
back-up
theory,
that
is
a
tight
proximate
cause
test,
then
i
would
say,
yes,
that
person
can
recover
under
ocsla,
but
that
is
really
a
fortuitous
set
of
circumstances
precisely
because
i
wouldn't
apply
a
substantial
nexus
test,
which
seems
to
me
just
an
invitation
to
kind
of
play
around
with--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--certainly
not.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
could
live
with
a
proximate
cause
test
as
long
as
it
is
a
proximate
cause
test
that
is
tailored
to
the
statute.
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute
you
can't
have
a
proximate
cause
test
that
doesn't
take
geography
into
account.
and
i
think
in
particular,
i
think
in
a
case
like
this
you
have
to
ask
yourself
not
just
proximate
cause
in
the
abstract,
but
were
there
operations
somewhere
other
than
the
shelf
that
were
a
more
direct
proximate
cause
of
the
injury?
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
remedy
lies
in
the
law
that
applies
to
those
other
operations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
you
know,
it's
funny
because
this
court
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
sort
of
remarked
that
"proximate
cause"
itself
is
a
weird
formulation
because
"proximate"
sounds
like
it
has
a
location
aspect
to
it.
and
we
actually
think
for
purposes
of
this
statute
that
should
be
right.
it's
proximate
cause
as
tailored
to
this
statute
and
the
policies
of
this
statute
and
i
think
that
would
want
to
really
take
the
geography
into
account.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
two
things.
one
is
i
do
think
there
is
anomaly
here,
but
i
do
think
you
are
not
being
asked
to
apply
proximate
cause
for
purposes
of
assessing
liability
because,
as
you
say,
strict
liability
is
kind
of
automatic
liability.
but
what
i
would
say
is
you
are
being
asked,
at
least
under
the
back-up
theory,
to
apply
proximate
cause
as
a
way
of
determining
the
geographical
scope
of
the
statute.
and
that's
anomalous,
but
i
don't
think
it's
so
anomalous
that
you
wouldn't
do
it
if
you
thought
that
was
the
better
way
to
read
the
statute.
that
said,
i
do
think
that
the
best
way
to
read
the
statute
is
consistent
with
the
all
the
other
statutes
as
part
of
a
jurisdictional
puzzle.
all
of
the
areas
off
of
the
shelf
are
governed,
with
the
exception
of
seamen
under
the
jones
act,
primarily
as
a
matter
of
geography.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
two
responses,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
already
confronted
the
objection
that,
well,
if
under
ocsla
workers
would
move
in
and
out
of
coverage
and
it
rejected
it
in
the
herb's
welding
case.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
common
ground
--
well,
maybe
not,
but
it
should
be
common
ground
that
if
you
had
a
worker
who
was
injured
on
a
state
platform,
that
that
would
not
be
covered
by
--
a
state
waters
platform,
that
that
would
not
be
covered
by
ocsla.
and
again,
that
was
an
anomaly
that
this
court
confronted
in
herb's
welding
and
the
court
said:
yes,
well,
workers
are
going
to
move
in
and
out
of
coverage,
but
that's
what
ocsla
says.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
and
it's
the
longshore
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
my
argument--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
helps
me
because
1333(b)
doesn't
apply
a
different
model.
it
adopts
this
model.
it
adopts
and
extends
the
longshoreman
act
to
the
shelf.
see,
it's
a
mistake
to
read
1333--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it
talks
about
that
as
part
of
extending
the
longshore
workers'
act
to
the
shelf.
it's
important
that,
you
know,
you
can't
get
--
i
mean,
1333(b),
like
i
said,
is
not
a
self-contained
offshore
workers
workers'
compensation
regime.
what
it
does
is
it
extends
the
longshore
workers'
act
to
the
shelf,
including
903(a).
but
what
i'm
saying
is
congress
recognized
that
you
couldn't
just
extend
903(a)
and
the
rest
of
the
act
to
the
shelf
without
modification,
because
then
you
come
to
this
language
that
says
you
only
get
relief
if
your
injury
occurred
on
the
navigable
waters
or
the
drydocks
attached
thereto.
so
congress
in
(b)(3)
changes
the
definition
of
the
united
states
for
geographical
purposes
in
a
way
that
allows
you
to
superimpose
this
provision
to
the
shelf,
but
instead
of
reading
it
to
say
you
only
get
a
recovery
if
you
are
injured
on
the
navigable
waters
including
the
drydocks,
you
get
a
recovery
if
you're
injured
on
the
navigable
waters,
including
the
shelf,
the
drydocks,
the
artificial
islands
and
the
fixtures
attached
thereto.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
herb's
welding
is
not
a
holding,
but
at
the
end
of
that
opinion
the
court
confronts
this
argument
that,
isn't
it
odd
that
somebody
would
be
moving
in
and
out
of
coverage,
and
the
court
says
that
that
is
a
product
of
ocsla.
and
it
doesn't
say
it's
a
product
of
ocsla
generally;
it
says
particularly
that
it's
a
product
of
ocsla's
extension
of
the
longshore
act.
and
i
do
think
that
this
objection
about
people
moving
in
and
out
was
answered
by
the
court
in
herb's
welding.
i
would
also
say,
justice
ginsburg,
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
your
earlier
question
is,
i
understand
that
it
might
make
policy
sense
to
have
coverage
that
encapsulates
an
individual
no
matter
where
they
work.
but
the
problem
is
that's
not
only
a
different
model,
that's
the
model
that
congress
rejected.
they
thought
long
and
hard
about
having
an
admiralty
remedy,
and
presumably
then
the
jones
act
would
apply,
and
if
you
were
attached
to
a
vessel
or
a
platform
then
you
would
have
coverage
no
matter
where
you
went.
but
that's
not
what
they
did.
they
incorporated
instead
as
their
model
the
longshore
act,
and
the
longshore
act
always
had
a
situs
requirement.
so
when
congress
makes
a
conscious
effort
to
deal
with
this
unusual
geographical
problem
with
--
and
solves
the
problem
with
the
longshore
act,
which
is
sitting
there
with
a
situs
requirement,
and
doesn't
adopt
the
jones
act,
which
has
a
status-only
requirement,
it
seems
very,
very,
peculiar
to
adopt
instead
a
model
that
would
have
a
status-only
test.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
that's
--
they
rejected
that
with
good
reason,
your
honor,
because
you
have
to
remember
that
at
this
point
they
are
living
with
the
experience
that
this
court
ultimately
resolved.
but
they
are
living
in
real-time
with
the
experience
of
people
under
the
longshore
act,
which
at
that
point
did
carve
out
and
limit
the
remedy,
the
federal
remedy,
only
when
a
state
remedy
was
unavailable.
and
they
were
watching
that
play
out
and
it
was
a
mess.
people
didn't
know
if
they
should
bring
a
state
case
or
a
federal
case,
and
at
that
point
they
were
viewed
as
exclusive.
so
congress
had
ample
reasons
to
reject
the
idea
that
we're
going
to
only
give
a
federal
remedy
if
a
state
remedy
is
unavailable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia,
i
don't
know
which
other
statutes
you
are
talking
about.
i
mean,
the
other
statute
that
most
plainly
has
a
situs
argument
is
the
longshore
act,
and
that
is
precisely
what
they
extended
to
the
shelf,
as
i've
argued.
beyond
that,
it's
true
that
some
of
the
other
provisions
of
this
act
have
slightly
different
wording,
but
i
don't
think
anything
turns
on
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kagan,
first
of
all,
it's
interesting.
the
only
way
they
can
say
that
those
functions
were
performed
by
the
statute
anyways
is
to
incorporate
provisions
of
the
longshore
act,
because
1333(b)
itself
doesn't
take
care
of
latent
injuries,
or
doesn't
take
care
of,
you
know,
who
is
in
the
scope
of
their
employment.
all
of
that
is
taken
care
of
in
the
longshore
act,
which
is
why
i
think
the
best
way
to
read
this
is
incorporating
the
longshore
act
and
its
situs
requirement.
but
beyond
that,
i
would
never
ask
you
to
make
six
words
go
away,
never.
those
words
do
play
a
function,
but
the
function
they
play
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
injury
has
to
result
of
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf
for
certain
purposes.
and
that
precludes
an
employee
accountant
who
is
out
on
the
shelf
and
injured
by
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
shelf
operations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kagan,
i
would
beg
to
differ.
and
i
think
what
you
have
to
understand
is,
go
back
in
1953
and
when
they
--
i
mean,
you
can
say
confidently
that
there
aren't
accountants
on
the
shelf
because
you
have
the
benefit
of
60
--
60
years
of
experience
with
--
post-1953
with
what
goes
on,
on
the
shelf.
congress
at
this
point
is
sort
of
legislating
for
a
brave
new
world,
and
they
don't
--
they
are
trying
to
provide
for
all
of
the
occasions
that
may
come
to
pass
out
on
the
shelf.
there
is
a
great
law
review
article
that
actually
provides
this
background,
and
it's
written
by,
of
all
people,
warren
christopher,
the
warren
christopher,
and
it's
in
the
stanford
law
review,
and
it
was
written
in
december
of
1953,
and
it's
worth
a
look
because
it
captures
this
idea
that
they
are
kind
of,
you
know,
legislating
for
this
brave
new
world
out
there
and
they
don't
know
who
is
going
to
be
out
there.
they
don't
know
if
it
is
going
to
be
all
drill
workers
or
if
there
is
going
to
be
accountants
and
clerical
workers
out
there.
and
so
i
think
with
that
context,
it's
not
at
all
odd
that
they
would
use
those
six
words
to
say,
kind
of
the
way
that
congress
did
later
in
1972
in
imposing
the
marine
employment
test
for
longshoremen,
it's
like,
look,
we
want
to
provide
a
longshore
remedy,
but
not
to
just
anybody,
any
employee
who
might
happen
to
be
on
the
shelf;
we
want
to
provide
it
to
those
people
who
are
essentially
in
the
core
operations
that
are
going
on,
on
the
shelf.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
deference,
and
i
think
before
you
give
any
deference
to
the
government's
position
you
should
look
at
the
other
government's
position
which
is
to
say
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
its
brief
to
this
court
in
picket
v.
petroleum
helicopters
in
2002.
they
have
a
completely
different
position
now
and
they've
never
explained
the
difference
other
than
to
say
what
they
thought
was
plausible
then
they
now
find
persuasive
now.
that's
not
enough
for
deference.
and
in
that
brief
they
took
a
position
very
similar
to
ours.
there
has
to
be
status
plus
situs
albeit
a
slightly
different
situs,
but
otherwise
it's
on
all
fours
with
our
position.
second
of
all,
the
government
comes
up
here
and
says
the
longshore
remedy
is
an
outlier
among
workers'
compensation
remedies
because
it's
the
only
one
with
a
situs.
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
of
all
the
workers'
compensation
provisions
that
congress
could
have
extended
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
it
picked
the
longshore
act
with
the
situs
requirement.
and
the
government
also
says,
well,
you
know,
the
reason
that
the
longshore
act
had
a
situs
requirement
was
because
of
jensen,
and
this
court's
decision
in
jensen
created
a
problem
about
whether
state
workers'
comp
law
could
go
to
navigable
waters.
well,
that's
the
same
back
drop
against
which
congress
is
passing
ocsla.
it
doesn't
know
that
state
workers'
compensation
law
can
go
to
the
outer
continental
shelf.
jensen
is
still
good
law.
jensen
tells
congress
that
it
can't
extend
--
they
can't
extend
their
laws
to
the
navigable
waters.
what
makes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
no,
justice
ginsburg.
what
states
overwhelming
did
is
say
a
worker
could
be
covered
in
a
different
state.
but
covering
them
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
was
not
something
that
was
well
established.
and
indeed
congress
specifically
heard
testimony
that
questioned
the
ability
of
either
states
to
get
their
workers'
comp
law
there
directly
and
also
heard
that
there
might
be
constitutional
problems
because
of
the
knickerbocker
ice
case
of
congress
extending
the
state
law
there.
so
that's
why
they
settled
on
this
remedy
of
taking
this
longshore
act
that
solved
the
jensen
problem
on
the
navigable
waters
and
solved
the
same
problem
for
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
as
other
alternatives
like
the
jones
act?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure,
when
they
were
on
the
shelf.
but
they
were
solving
the
exact
same
kind
of
jurisdictional
problem
they
saw
with
the
longshore
act
with
the
shelf
--
with
the
statute.
justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
think
you
can
read
too
much
into
b(2).
all
b(2)
is
doing
is
modifying
the
same
definition
for
the
longshores.
you
are
an
employer
if
you
employ
a
longshoreman
or
a
longshore
worker.
so
they
are
just
updating
this
for
purposes
of
extending
a
longshore
remedy
to
the
shelf.
b(3)
does
the
same
thing.
and
it
modifies
the
situs
and
creates
a
situs
that
makes
sense
for
the
shelf:
the
navigable
waters,
drydocks,
the
shelf,
artificial
islands
and
everything
attached
thereto.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
talked
about
the
imprecision
of
their
test.
it's
worse
than
that.
it's
imprecision
without
any
text.
at
least
in
the
jones
act
you
have
seamen
and
you
have
some
other
textual
clues
as
to
where
you
draw
these
limits.
here
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
in
any
way
suggests
a
status-based
test.
so
you
would
be
completely
unmoored,
if
you
will.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
this.
the
answer
to
the
causation
test
is
really
of
the
kind
of
a
lie
of
the
other
side's
position
is
what
they
say
when
they
are
dealing
with
somebody
who
is
not
a
98
per
center
but
is
a
2
per
center.
when
that
person
goes
out
on
the
shelf,
when
are
they
covered?
well,
when
the
injuries
operating
on
the
shelf
cause
a
direct
injury
on
the
shelf.
at
that
point
even
the
government
resorts
to
a
situs-based
test.
well,
here's
the
problem.
that
status-based
test,
it
is
in
the
jones
act;
it's
not
in
ocsla.
and
even
when
you
recognize
that
and
you
look
at
what
is
left
of
the
case,
what
is
left
of
the
case
is
either
our
approach
that
essentially
incorporates
the
longshore
act
through
b(3)
or
a
tight-nexus
test
that
would
require
a
geographical
focus
and
give
--
give
force
to
the
words
"conducted
on
the
shelf".
this
person
was
injured
by
operations
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
shelf
at
some
level,
but
he
sure
wasn't
injured
by
operations
conducted
on
the
shelf
for
those
purposes.
he
was
injured
by
operations
on
dry
land.
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
remedy
lies
with
the
state
workers'
comps
law,
not
with
ocsla.
