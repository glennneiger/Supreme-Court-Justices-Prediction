chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-507,
pacific
operators
offshore
v.
valladolid.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
on
land,
do
you
--
where
do
you
put
the
3-mile
state
offshore
limit?
does
that
count
as
land
under
your
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
a
little
--
it's
a
little
different
when
you
are
talking
about
a
labor
practice
and
an
activity
that
results
in
an
injury.
labor
practice
by
its
terms
is
going
to
have
applicability
to
a
particular
location.
so
you
would
expect
them
to
use
that
type
of
language.
it
doesn't
carry
the
same
negative
implication
you
are
suggesting
under
1333(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
but
what
if
that
exposure
is
not
pertinent
to
what
they
are
doing?
let's
take
the
individual,
98
percent
of
the
time
on
the
rig
and
2
percent
on
land,
and
an
emergency
comes
up
and
they
need
a
new
part
and
they
say:
here,
go
--
you
know,
go
drive
to
reno
where
they
have
a
new
part
and
bring
it
back.
and
he
skids
off
the
road
and
is
injured.
is
he
really
covered
by
the
offshore
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
he
is
--
he
is
injured
by
a
hazard
on
the
road
to
reno.
he's
--
i
don't
know
how
many
miles
that
is
from
the
offshore,
and
yet
he's
still
covered
by
the
offshore
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
i
don't
understand
the
answer.
so
he's
covered
by
both?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
both
positions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--both
positions,
mr.
frederick,
are
vulnerable
to
particular
hypotheticals.
you
have
imprecision
as
to
what
it
means
to
spend
most
of
your
time
on
the
--
on
the
shelf,
and
they
have
their
own
problems.
what
do
you
do
with
somebody
who's
--
3
months
he's
on
the
shelf,
and
then
3
months
he's
back
--
back
on
land
3
months?
does
it
depend
when
the
injury
occurs,
whether
it's
when
he's
on
the
land
part
of
his
job
or
on
the
shelf
part?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
given
you
all
the
totality.
he
is
working
3
months,
and
then
he's
--
you
know,
it's
seasonal
or
something,
and
3
months
he
is
on
--
on
the
land.
that
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
it's
the
kind
of
person?
i
thought
your
line
was
whether
or
not
he
spends
most
of
his
time
on
the
shelf
or
most
of
his
time
somewhere
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
30
percent
is
the
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
we
would
like
to
have
a
test
that
we
apply
to
your
situation,
and
it's
nice
to
know,
you
know,
maybe
30
percent
i
guess
is
as
good
as
any.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unless
he
spent
30
percent
of
his
time
on
the
shelf.
then
he's
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
obviously,
it's
a
real
mishmash,
and
maybe
that's
what
we
are
--
we
are
stuck
with.
how
does
this
work
as
a
practical
matter?
i'm
assuming
the
companies
get
insurance
to
cover
their
risks
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
decides
--
maybe
the
insurance
company
will
underwrite
how
many
people
spend
what
percentage
of
time
where?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wouldn't
they
have
to
pay
higher
insurance
rates
--
to
say
they're
not
liable
for
it
i
think
is
a
real--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
you
--
i
don't
mean
to
get
back
to
--
it's
not
you
have
to
say
that
congress
contemplated
the
person
who
spent
30
percent
of
his
time
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
in
terms
of
us
coming
up
with
a
test.
maybe
your
client
is
an
easy
case,
where
it's
98
percent.
but
the
test
you
want
us
to
adopt
covers
the
person
who
spends
70
percent
of
his
time
on
land?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
in
case
10-507,
pacific
operators
offshore
versus
valladolid.
