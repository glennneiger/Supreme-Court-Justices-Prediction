on
what
date
was
it
--
on
what
date
was
it
clear
that
the
use
would
be
gaming?
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
that,
oh,
well,
it
could
be
light
industry
and
it
was
zoned
for
economic
use
generally.
at
what
point
was
it
acknowledged
by
all
that
this
would
be
for
gaming?
at
the
very
outset?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
very
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
your
--
your
argument
is
just
one
of
timing
and
not
the
fact
that
the
reliance
is
on
the
--
is
on
the
qta.
the
tribe
says,
isn't
it
ironic
that
if
you
really
have
a
claim
in
the
land
as
a
property
owner
you
can't
sue
under
the
qta,
and
this
person
is
much
further
removed.
well,
that's
because
he
has
a
different
ground
for
relief.
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
fact
that
the
qta
suddenly,
deus
ex
machina,
pops
onto
the
scene
doesn't
mean
that
it
--
that
that
changes
his
--
his
ground
for
relief
that
he's
--
that
he's
relying
upon.
his
ground
of
relief
has
always
been
the
same,
apa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
were
the
provisions,
if
any,
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
itself
that
how
a
concern
for
the
kind
of
standing
that
you're
lleging
here?
it
seems
to
me
you're
talking
about
nvironmental
effects
and
so
forth
under
the
ndian
gaming
act,
but
yet
your
primary
suit
is
under
he
indian
reorganization
act.
so
i
don't
see
--
i
understand
how
that
might
give
you
standing,
but
how
oes
it
give
you
a
cause
of
action
for
relief
under
the
indian
reorganization
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
indian
reorganization
act,
just
to
help
pursue
the
question
a
little
bit
further,
has
a
provision
about
the
public
interest,
but
not
in
the
section
which
you're
relying
on.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
public
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does,
but
you're
going
under
465.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
specific
provision
of
the
ira
that
you
rely
on?
you
--
do
you
go
back
to
463?
because
there's
nothing
in
465
that
answers
your
--
this
question,
i
don't
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
helpful.
just
a
different
question,
going
back
to
what
--
justice
alito's
question.
it
does
seem
that
we
may
be
wasting
our
time.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
state
--
that
the
case
is
moot,
but
you
did
wait
for
some
three
years
before
you
brought
this
suit.
the
building
was
built.
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
considerable
laches
problem.
i
suppose
that's
just
not
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
under
the
michgo
suit,
not
yours.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
your
suit
had
been
filed
at
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
miller,
one
--
one
question,
if
--
if
i
may.
the
government
takes
the
position
--
at
least
this
was
the
way
the
respondent
puts
it
--
that
it
can
basically
moot
their
action
by
turning
this
into
a
quiet
title
action
just
by
taking
title.
and
let's
assume
that
that's
one
characterization
of
your
position.
and
the
respondent
on
the
other
hand
says,
oh,
well,
this
is
an
apa
action,
we
can
--
we
can
wait
forever,
at
least
for
6
years.
is
there
some
midway
position
that
the
government
can't
moot
the
case
too
soon,
that
it
must
wait
a
reasonable
time?
or
is
there
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
in
the
cases
for
that
position
to
hold?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
other
words
you're
--
you're
sticking
with
your
position.
you
say
you
can
basically
moot
a
suit
at
any
point
you
want
just
by
taking
title,
so
you're
--
you're
not
accepting
any
qualification
to
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
or
nothing,
okay.
