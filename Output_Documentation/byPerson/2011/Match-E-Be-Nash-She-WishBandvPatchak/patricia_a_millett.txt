ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
you
strip
title
to
land,
which
is
a
fact
in
this
case,
you
strip
sovereignty.
you
wreak
havoc
on
ongoing
governmental
operations,
you
--
on
criminal
jurisdiction,
civil
jurisdiction,
the
backdrop
against
which
contracts
were
negotiated,
investment
decisions
made
and
economic
development
undertaken.
that
is
why
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
this
court
in
coeur
d'alene
have
never
allowed
injunctive
relief
to
strip
the
united
states
of
title
that
it
has.
the
essence
of
sovereign
immunity
is,
right
or
wrong,
you
cannot
take
title
away
that
the
united
states
has.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--for
two
reasons,
justice
scalia.
because
the
apa
itself
--
and
this
is
on
page
6a
of
the
addendum
to
our
brief
--
says
that
it
does
not
waive
sovereign
immunity
and
does
not
grant
relief
if
another
statute
expressly
or
impliedly
forecloses
the
relief
that
is
sought.
and
the
quiet
title
act
says
you
cannot
have
an
injunction
stripping
the
united
states
of
land,
period,
and
you
cannot
have
any
litigation
over
title--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
you
can
get
no
injunctive
relief
whatsoever
even
if
you
are
asserting
title.
but
the
quiet
title
act
itself
is
brought
--
it
limits
relief
to
monetary
compensation,
unless
the
government
agrees
to
a
specific
relief.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
--
no.
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
on
page
--
this
is
2a
of
the
addendum
to
our
brief,
2409a(a),
the
type
of
suit
that
is
addressed,
and
to
which
the
indian
lands
exception
applies,
is
a
suit
--
and
i'm
reading
here
from
the
second
line
of
a(a):
"a
civil
action
--"--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
on
the
addendum
to
our
--
the
blue
brief,
2a,
and
this
is
the
quiet
title
act.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
right
--
subsection
(a),
the
second
line,
all
right:
"the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
for
a
civil
action
under
this
section
to
adjudicate
a
disputed
title.
"
it
does
not
say--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
justice
kagan,
in
this
respect.
that
tells
you
what
you
have
to
do
if
you
are
allowed
to
proceed
under
the
statute
to
win,
the
first
step
of
what
you
have
to
do;
but,
what
subsection
(a)
says
is
what
is
carved
out,
what
is
a
wholesale
--
and
this
court
said
in
mottaz,
a
retention
of
immunity,
even
in
the
face
of
arguments
that
the
government
has
done
wrong
administratively,
as
in
mottaz.
what
you
do
--
have
done
is
retain
immunity.
when
the
--
the
section
here
right
under
the
sentence
i
read,
justice
scalia,
about
this
section
does
not
apply
to
trust
or
restricted
indian
lands,
what
that
meant
was
that
this
--
that
congress,
against
a
backdrop
of
complete
immunity,
said:
we've
looked
at
lands,
we've
studied
what
we're
doing,
and
we
are
not
doing
two
things,
and
we're
going
to
be
explicit
about
it.
we
are
not
letting
you
touch
indian
lands.
the
united
states
may
not
be
named--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
section
is,
i
think,
defined
by
what
congress's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
it
didn't
say
we're
waiving
sovereign
immunity
for
quiet
title
actions.
it
says
for
a
civil
action
in
which
the
united
states'
title
is
disputed.
so
quieting
u.s.
title--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely.
before
title--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
there's
a
constructive
amendment
in
this
sense,
because
if
the
only
thing
with--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain.
if
i
can
explain,
to
be
sure,
the
complaint,
which
was
untimely
filed
for
purposes
of
the
protection
of
the
government's
not
taking
it
into
--
into
trust,
but
the
set
--
it
did
seek
to
stop
the
decision
from
happening.
after
that
happened,
when
he
did
not
seek
appeal
or
emergency
relief
from
the
district
court
not
giving
him
the
injunction
he
asked
for
--
he
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
to
stop
the
taking
of
title.
the
district
court
didn't
give
it.
it
actually
sat
on
it,
constructively
denied
it.
and
it's
well
recognized
in
courts
of
appeals,
you
can
appeal
a
constructive
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
he
didn't
do
that.
this
is
the
way
litigation
works.
title
shifted.
sovereign
immunity
shifted.
the
quiet
title
act
didn't
apply,
then
it
did
apply
because
title
was
in
the
hand
and
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
government.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
so
after
that,
he
had
two
choices.
he
can
dismiss
the
action
as
moot,
but
what
happened
is
he
continued
to
press
--
and
this
is
on
page
25
of
his
brief,
his
court
of
appeals
brief,
at
page
26
and
27
--
he
wants
an
injunction
now,
not
to
stop
title,
but
to
take
title
out.
and
that's
when
the
quiet
title
act--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it
was--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
because
the
quiet
title
act--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
quiet
title
act,
when
it
says
--
when
it
says
the
only
way
we'll
give
you
a
relief
is
if
you
can
establish
that
you
have
an
interest
in
the
land,
forecloses
suits
seeking
to
adjudicate
--
adjudicate,
excuse
me
--
disputed
u.s.
title
by
those
who
don't
even
have
an
interest.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
against
the
back
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
to
be
clear,
as
justice
scalia
himself
then
testified
before
congress,
the
law
was
a
mess,
and
you
could
not
discern
anything
from
larson,
malone.
and
the
one
area
where
actually
courts
have
pretty
consistently
denied
relief,
as
justice
scalia
then
said,
was
in
the
land
area.
and
congress
responded
to
hardship;
but,
in
doing
so,
it
was
making
a
critical
balance.
it
knew
how
disruptive
to
government
it
is
to
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
the
feet
of
the
federal
government's
operations.
and
--
and
it
said
we're
going
to
draw
lines,
and
there's
three
lines.
it
said
no
suits
involving
indian
lands,
no
injunctive
relief
or
coercive
injunctive
relief
at
all
will
be
allowed.
if
you
have
a
right,
you
will
only
get
damages
unless
the
government
agrees
otherwise.
and
to
prevail,
you
must
have
an
interest
in
land.
now,
that
is
a
concerted
judgment
of
congress
that
we
will
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--he
could
--
he
could
bring
a
nuisance
action
assuming
the
tribe
waives
sovereign
immunity,
which
would
be
its
own
problem.
assuming
--
i'm
assuming
this
is
a
suit
against
the
tribe
and
not
the
secretary.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
so
there
would
be
their
own
either
state
law
or
sovereign
immunity
questions
if
he
could
bring
it.
and
then
if
the
government
tried
to
raise
this
--
or,
excuse
me,
the
tribe
raised
it
as
a
preemption
defense,
then
there
would
be
a
separate
question
whether
at
that
point
a
court
could
issue,
consistent
with
the
quiet
title
act,
a
declaratory
judgment
which
would
pull
the
rug
out
from
the
government's
feet.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
now,
to
be
sure,
in
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
is
no
question
he
coul
bring
--
assuming
tribal
sovereign
immunity,
that
he
could
bring
a
nuisance
action;
but,
it's
also
important
to
remember
in
that
context,
the
other
reason
that
nuisance
action
would
fail
is
that
the
courts
have
already
ruled
on
this
claim
about
the
legitimacy
of
authorization
of
gambling,
about
the
environmental
effects
and
esthetic
effects
in
the
michgo
litigation.
this
is
simply
recycled
through
the
ira
claims
that
have
already
been
adjudicated
and
lost.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
with
respect
to
the
question
of
judicial
review
that
was
mentioned
earlier
and
i
think
would
be
implicated,
obviously,
in
a
nuisance
action
--
this
is
sort
of
being
case
specific
with
respect
to
claim
preclusion
and
issues
like
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you,
your
honor.
