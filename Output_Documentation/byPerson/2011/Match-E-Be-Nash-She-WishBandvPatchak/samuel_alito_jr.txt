justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
someone
filed
a
challenge
within
the
30-day
period
and
then
the
government
took
title
to
the
land
while
the
litigation
was
pending?
do
the
regulations
preclude
that
from
happening
while
the
litigation
continues,
or
is
it
necessary
for
the
--
the
challenger
to
obtain
a
stay
from
a
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
that
enforceable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
depends
on
whether
sovereign
immunity
is
judged
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
or
as
of
the
time
of
the
litigation
of
the
sovereign
immunity
claim,
right?
and
you
claim
--
you
don't
want
us
to
address
that
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
mr.
patchak
were
to
--
were
to
prevail?
i
take
--
i
understand
the
casino's
built
and
running.
so
what
would
happen?
