justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
miller,
you
--
you
claim
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
take
the
land
into
trust
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
to
which
the
land
will
be
put;
wherefore,
these
plaintiffs
who
are
complaining
about
the
use
to
which
it'll
be
put
have
no
standing.
if
that
is
so,
why
did
the
government
delay
the
taking
into
trust
for
three
years
while
there
was
pending
a
lawsuit
which
would
have
prevented
the
use
that
the
government
intended
the
newly
trusted
land
to
be
used
for?
you
delayed
for
three
years
because
there
was
a
challenge
to
whether
you
could
use
--
whether
this
land
could
be
used
for
what
you
call
gaming
and
i
call
gambling.
why
did
you
delay
for
three
years
if
it's
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
on
what
basis?
on
any
basis
other
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
environmental
action
consequences
are
there
from
the
mere
decision
to
take
it
into
trust?
unless
you
know
what
it's
going
to
be
used
for,
you
have
no
idea
what
the
environmental
consequences
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
challenge
was
to
--
was
to
the
transfer,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
based
in
part
on
the
use
to
which
it
was
going
to
be
put,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
of
course,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
within
the
interest,
it
just
has
to
be
arguably
within
the
interest.
that
--
that
adverb
is
left
out
in
much
of
the
discussion.
but
if,
indeed,
the
use
of
the
land
is
one
of
the
elements
to
be
considered
in
taking
title,
why
isn't
somebody
who
is
affected
by
the
proposed
use
within
the
zone
of
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
put
that
it
way,
or
you
could
put
it
the
injury
comes
from
the
government's
taking
title
for
gaming.
okay?
you
could
put
it
that
way
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
inasmuch
as
the
government
always
has
a
purpose
in
mind
when
it
takes
title.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
act
provides
for
that.
the
act
provides
for
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
--
is
that
in
the
--
is
that
in
the
administrative
procedure
act?
i
thought
the
administrative
procedure
act
eliminates
the
--
the
old
bugaboo
of
sovereign
immunity
and
says
when
it
--
when
it
will
stand
and
when
it
won't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you're
relying
on
the
quiet
title
act,
that
--
that
clearly
covers
only
suits
which
seek
to
say,
i
own
the
land
rather
than
the
government,
and
this
is
not
such
a
suit.
so
i
don't
see
why
normal
apa
principles
wouldn't
govern.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
relief
to
be
sought
under
the
quiet
title
act
is
title
in
the
plaintiff.
that's
the
relief
ultimately
sought.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
on
the
way
to
that,
you
may
--
you
may
get
some
injunctive
remedy,
but
the
basis
for
the
lawsuit
is
--
is
not:
i
own
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
relief
in
that
kind
of
suit,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
relief
in
that
kind
of
suit.
but
this
is
not
that
kind
of
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
guess
i've
lost
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say
that
again
and
again,
counsel,
but
it
does
say
"under
this
section".
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
how
you
get
out
from
under
that.
it
says
"under
this
section".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
this
section
applies
only
to
suits
seeking
to
assert
title
on
the
part
of
a
plaintiff,
it's
not
under
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
answer
how
his
--
his
complaint
constructively
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
us
how
it
constructively
changed
to
be
an
action
seeking
to
have
a
decree
that
title
was
in
him,
which
is
what
the
qta
covers.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
constructively,
it
hasn't
turned
into
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
30-day
window
only
applies
to
quiet
title
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
--
surely
the
30-day
envisions
comments
by
anybody,
not
just
people
who
claim
to
own
the
property,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
--
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
the
government
will
correct
me
if
i
am.
i
thought
the
government
concedes
that
a
nepa
action
could
--
could
be
brought
when
the
government
is
taking
land
to
use
for
a
particular
use.
let's
say
it's
--
it's
taking
land
for
a
nuclear
waste
repository.
certainly
a
nepa
action
would
--
would
lie.
you
don't
disagree
with
that,
do
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
supposed
to
say,
yes,
sir,
good.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
--
you're
answering
the
question
with
regard
to
an
argument
i
don't
think
you've
made
and
i
don't
think
you
would
want
to
make.
you're
not
asserting
that
the
action
can
be
brought
anytime
within
six
years
after
the
government
has
already
taken
the
land.
you're
just
asserting
that
an
action
brought
before
the
government
takes
the
land
does
not
change
its
character
and
become
a
quiet
title
action
afterwards;
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that
anybody
can
bring
within
six
years
after
the
government's
taking
a
suit,
are
you?
i
hope
you're
not
arguing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
right.
i
pushed
you
into
it.
it's
my
fault.
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
the
government
can
fix
that.
i
mean,
if
this
is
indeed
an
inconvenient
situation,
that
we
think
the
government
should
not
be
in
doubt
for
6
years
afterwards,
i
guess
congress
can
simply
change
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
totally
within
the
control
of
congress.
we
--
we
--
we
don't
have
to
make
up
some
limitation
to
protect
--
to
protect
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
this
as
a
reason?
when
you
prevail
in
a
quiet
title
action,
the
only
way
the
government
can
get
off
the
hook
is
to
give
you
the
land,
if
it's
--
if
it's
within,
what,
the
6
years,
or
pay
you
money,
if
it's
after
6
years,
but
within
12.
whereas
in
your
case,
i
suppose
the
government
could
moot
the
suit,
moot
the
suit,
by
simply
disallowing
gambling.
can
the
government
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
it
has
told
the
tribe
that
they
can
have
--
i
mean,
this
suit
could
be
--
could
go
away
so
long
as
the
tribe
does
not
run
a
casino;
isn't
that
right?
that's
your
--
that's
the
gravamen
of
your
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
you
--
you
could
be
a
happy
fellow
if
--
so
long
as
the
tribe
doesn't
build
a
casino,
whereas
in
--
in
quiet
title
cases,
the
only
way
you
can
make
a
happy
fellow
out
of
the
plaintiff
is
to
give
him
the
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
do
you
have
any
concern
that
the
government
will
get
hoist
by
its
own
petard?
what
your
argument
--
the
conclusion
to
which
your
argument
leads
is
that
this
individual
or
any
individual
claiming
that
the
government
took
title
incorrectly
can
sue
under
the
quiet
title
act,
even
if
they
don't
claim
that
title
was
taken
from
them.
are
you
sure
that's
good
for
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that's
not
the
only
time
the
government
takes
land,
right?
