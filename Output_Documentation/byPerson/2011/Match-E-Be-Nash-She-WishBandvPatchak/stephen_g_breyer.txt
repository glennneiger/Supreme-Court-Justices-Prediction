justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then
why
isn't
it
like
your
30
days?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
--
the
--
this
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
don't
understand.
forget
standing
for
a
moment.
i'm
just
thinking
of
your
quiet
title
action.
this
wasn't
an
action
to
quiet
title
at
all.
this
was
a
--
i
looked
at
the
complaint,
as
i
--
as
i
gather
from
his
questions,
so
did
the
chief
justice.
and
it
is
a
complaint
filed
before
the
--
the
property
was
taken
into
trust,
and
it
asks
for
an
injunction
under
the
apa,
if
it
wants
review
of
that,
before
the
government
has
any
title
to
it
at
all,
or
at
least
it
hasn't
taken
it
into
trust.
so
why
are
we
considering
quiet
title?
what
has
that
to
do
with
this?
why
isn't
it
exactly
what
--
now,
that's
the
same
as
the
chief
justice
asked,
and
i
have
exactly
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
why
isn't
that
--
that's
the
end
of
that
argument,
then,
isn't
it,
because
this
suit
was
brought
seeking
an
injunction
before
the
land
was
taken
into
trust;
the
district
court
denies
the
request
for
the
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
that.
and
so
there
we
are.
we're
reviewing
that
action
by
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
a
judge
who
said
you
are
not
entitled
to
an
injunction
sought
before
the
land
was
taken
into
trust.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
don't
know
about
that.
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
don't
know
how
--
how
we
should
treat
that.
there
was
an
order.
suppose
that
order
was
wrong.
suppose
they
should
have
granted
the
injunction.
then
isn't
what
we
should
do,
send
it
back
because
that
injunction
should
have
been
granted,
then
have
a
hearing
or
trial
or
whatever
you
want
to
have
on
whether
the
act
applies,
and
then
figure
out
how
you
do
relief?
which
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
didn't
appeal
that.
he
appealed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
--
but
you
don't
--
you
can't
believe
that
totally
because
you
agree
there
is
some
apa
review
of
an
action
brought
before
the
title
shifts
where
the
claim
is
you
cannot
take
title,
secretary.
you
agree
with
that.
you
can
bring
some.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
once
you
agree
to
that,
i
stop
at
the
words,
not
just
"under
this
section",
but
"to
adjudicate
a
disputed
title
to
real
property.
"
then
i
read
his
complaint.
his
complaint,
on
31
to
38,
is
asking
for
an
injunction,
and
it's
asking
for
an
injunction
before
they
take
any
title
to
the
property.
and
maybe
they
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyway,
but
is
there
some
other
complaint
that
i
didn't
read?
is
there
some
amendment
to
the
complaint
in
the
record?
if
so,
where
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
about
a
constructive
amendment
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
you
can't
--
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
--
i
mean
--
sorry.
you
answer
it
as
you
want
according
to
your
argument.
there
is
a
difficult
question
here.
the
difficult
question
is
what
happens
if
one
brings
an
ordinary
apa
suit
before
land
is
taken,
before
that
suit
can
be
decided,
before
that
suit
can
be
decided,
the
government
takes
the
land.
does
that
transform
it
into
a
quiet
title
action?
the
obvious
answer,
which
isn't
obvious
at
all,
is
that
the
answer
is
that
it's
a
proper
apa
suit
if
you
bring
it
before
they
take
it.
and
if
you
bring
it
after
they
take
it,
it's
a
quiet
title
action.
and
--
and
that
would
seem
to
me
a
first
blush
answer.
but
i
haven't
found
--
i
mean,
that's
a
question
we
don't
--
i
don't
know
if
we
have
to
answer
that
question.
it
seems
to
be
quite
difficult.
and
i
don't
know
what
authority
there
is.
and
is
it
fully
argued
in
the
briefs?
so
what
--
isn't
that
what
--
you're
thinking
--
i
think
justice
sotomayor
is
thinking,
well,
and
you
just
said
you
can
bring
it
after.
i
don't
know
if
you
can
bring
it
after.
so
go
one
and
answer
now--
[laughter]
and
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
injury,
your
injury
is
that
it's
being
used
for
gambling.
so
is
there
room
for
relief
that
could
say
the
government
can
do
what
it
wants
to
the
land,
it
just
can't
let
it
be
used
for
gambling,
if
you
want.
and
that
would
cure
your
injury,
and
it
wouldn't
require
the
government
to
give
back
the
land,
and
it
wouldn't
require
any
unscrambling,
and
title
could
rest
in
the
government.
i
don't
know
if
that's
possible
or
not
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
justice
scalia's
argument
was
a
bad
argument.
i
thought
it
was
a
rather
good
argument.
if
in
fact
you
go
back
and
you
take
the
view
that
any
suit
filed
to
review
apa
is
not
a
quiet
title
action,
people
could
go
upset
government
title
to
property
years
and
years
later.
and
they
would
say:
oh,
well,
we're
not
challenging
the
title;
we're
just
challenging
what
happened
when
it
was
taken,
the
title
was
taken.
that
can't
be
right,
it
seems
to
me,
first
blush.
so,
therefore,
i
thought
you
--
yours
was
different
because
you
filed
before
they
took
title.
but,
as
i
say,
i'm
uncertain
of
that
distinction.
now,
your
answer
suggests
you've
been
going
both
ways.
sometimes
you
think,
well,
it
matters
that
we
filed
before,
and
other
times
you
think,
no,
it
doesn't
matter.
