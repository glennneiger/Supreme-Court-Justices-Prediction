justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
who
you
think
would
have
a
valid
and
timely
apa
action
to
challenge
what
the
secretary
has
allegedly
done
here,
which
is
to
take
lands
into
trust
in
violation
of
the
statute
per
our
--
i
know
that
the
u.s.
is
challenging
that
assumption,
but
let's
assume
the
reality
of
the
allegation.
who
would
--
who
would
be
able
to
challenge
it,
and
in
what
mechanism?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that,
i
understand.
that's
why
i
said
timely
filed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
a
situation
where
you
first
promise
the
land
to
one
tribe,
and
then,
in
the
midst
of
negotiations,
another
tribe
lays
claim.
the
united
states
says,
i
change
my
mind;
i'm
going
to
give
the
land
to
the
other
tribe.
does
the
tribe
that
you
have
denied
the
land
to
have
any
standing
or
any
rights
with
respect
to
challenging
that
determination?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
you're
assuming
that
the
statute
was
passed
against
a
backdrop
of
complete
sovereign
immunity;
but,
if
you
look
at
larson
and
malone,
it
appears
as
if
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
qta
people
could
bring
suits
to
say
that
an
officer
had
acted
beyond
his
or
her
statutory
authority.
so
what
the
quiet
title
act
did
was
encapsulate
some
of
that
law.
from
where
do
we
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
intent
was
to
eliminate
every
other
claim
that
could
be
brought
under
something
like
the
apa
or
an
officer
suit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
have
been
entitled
to
file
in
that
30-day
period?
how
is
your
claim,
the
one
that
you
ultimately
made,
any
different
than
what
you
would
have
done
if
you
had
filed
within
the
30
days?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
same
claim,
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
tell
me
what
relief
you're
seeking
that's
different
than
--
are
you
--
what
relief
are
you
seeking?
aren't
you
seeking
to
shed
the
united
states
of
its
title?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
the
--
what's
the
--
don't
tell
me
what
your
cause
of
action
is.
what
relief
at
the
end
of
the
day
do
you
want?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
is
there
any
limit
to
who
can
bring
an
apa
action
under
your
theory?
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
anyone
other
than
a
landowner
because
of
the
quiet
title
act
can
within
6
years
attempt
to
unravel
any
decision
the
government
has
made
to
take
land,
because
we're
not
limited
now
to
trust
lands.
we're
limited
--
under
your
theory,
whenever
the
government
takes
any
kind
of
land,
anyone's
entitled
to
come
in
and
challenge
that
action
under
the
apa
for
6
years
and
to
seek
an
injunction
because
it
isn't
a
quiet
title
action.
it's
merely
a
challenge
to
the
decision
to
take
land.
is
there
any
limit
to
your
theory
as
to
who
can
bring
that
kind
of
action
and--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
which
way?
you're
saying
anyone
who
is
affected,
your
niece,
your
farm
owner's
niece
who
comes
to
visit
twice
a
year
or
visits
the
land
and
walks
through
it,
could
presumably
say:
i'm
negatively
affected
by
the
government's
taking
of
this
land,
indian
or
not,
within
the
6
years,
and
the
government
improperly
took
the
land;
undo
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
my
question
--
counsel,
my
question
was
different.
under
your
theory,
you
could
bring
this
suit
after
the
land
has
been
taken.
nepa
assumes
before
the
land
was
taken.
i'm
talking
about
under
your
theory
of
law,
once
land
has
been
taken
by
the
u.s.,
if
anyone
has
a
viable
legal
claim
that
the
land
was
taken
improperly,
whether
it's
indian
trust
land
or
anyone
else's
land
for
any
other
purpose,
that
person
within
6
years
can
still
bring
a
suit
under
the
apa.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
government
land
is
always
taken
by
administrative
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
forget
about
the
trust.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
under
your
theory
of
what
--
what
the
apa
permits
you
to
do,
anytime
the
government
takes
land,
whether
into
trust
or
for
any
other
purpose,
the
apa
permits
someone
within
six
years,
with
whatever
definition
of
prudential
standing
you
want
to
give
it,
to
come
in
after
the
taking
and
challenge
that
it
was
ultra
vires,
that
it
was
done
improperly.
that's
your
theory.
so
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
why
isn't
that
within
the
quiet
title
action
prohibition--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--once
it's
in
the
government's
hands.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
that
the
--
i
thought
part
of
it
was
agricultural
land,
and
that
another
part
was
a
business.
i
mean,
i
think
--
i
thought
--
well,
the
government
can
correct
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
because
you
don't
have
a
theory
as
to
why
once
the
government
takes
it
it's
not
a
quiet
title
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
answer
my
question,
or
the
one
that
justice
breyer
has
said.
then
it
doesn't
--
and
the
one
justice
kagan
repeated
yet
again
--
okay?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
government
has
taken
title?
whether
the
government
has
title
or
doesn't,
under
your
theory,
since
this
is
not
a
quiet
action
--
title
action,
anyone
who
is
unhappy
with
the
way
the
government
took
title
could
challenge
it
within
6
years.
isn't
that
the
bottom
line
of
your
theory?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
absent
laches.
you
say
the
only
defense
is
laches.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
bottom
line
is,
under
your
theory,
as
long
as
no
landowner,
the
person
most
directly
affected
by
the
taking,
as
long
as
that
person
can't
sue,
but
anybody
who
is
an
indirect
person
can
sue
within
6
years,
anybody
who
says,
i
don't
want
the
land,
i
just
don't
want
the
u.s.
to
have
the
land.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
can't
undo
the
transfer.
they
can
only
get
money.
