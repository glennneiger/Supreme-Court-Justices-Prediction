justice
elena
kagan
well,
on
the
standing
point,
i
mean,
does
the
--
the
distinction
that
you're
setting
up
between
acquisition
of
land
and
use
of
land
--
this
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
--
that
strikes
me
as
artificial,
that
the
question
of
when
land
is
acquired
is
all
tied
up
with
the
question
of
what
use
is
going
to
be
made
of
it.
the
government
doesn't
acquire
this
land
with
no
object
in
mind.
it
thinks
about
how
the
land
is
going
to
be
used.
so
that,
in
the
end,
this
really
is
a
land
use
statute,
isn't
it.
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
statute
as
well
thinks
of
this
as
a
--
is
a
statute
that's
designed
to
promote
economic
development,
which
is
dependent
on
some
understanding
of
how
the
land
is
actually
going
to
be
used
by
the
tribes.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
millett,
it
also
says:
"under
this
section".
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
section
describes
the
complaint.
it
says:
"the
complainant
shall
set
forth
with
particularity
the
nature
of
the
right,
title,
or
interest
which
the
plaintiff
claims.
"
so
the
type
of
suit
that
this
section
has
in
mind
is
a
suit
in
which
the
plaintiff
claims
a
right,
title
or
interest.
and
the
language
that
you
read,
"under
this
section",
well,
that's
what
this
section
is
about,
a
suit
in
which
a
plaintiff
claims
the
right,
title
or
interest.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
nelson,
putting
that
question
aside
of
whether
this
is
or
isn't
a
quiet
title
action,
there's
another
question,
which
is
whether
sovereign
immunity
can
come
into
effect
after
a
suit
has
been
filed.
it
seems
to
me
a
hard
question
and
one
that
has
not
been
briefed
by
either
party
particularly.
so
i
just
ask
you,
is
there
case
--
are
there
any
cases
that
you
can
point
to
that
suggest
that
sovereign
immunity
cannot
come
into
effect
after
a
suit
has
been
filed?
because
what
the
government
says
is,
you
know,
circumstances
change,
conditions
change
on
the
ground,
sovereign
immunity
can
pop
up
where
it
didn't
exist
before.
is
there
any
precedent
that
you
have
to
negate
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
nelson--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
nelson,
could
i
understand
the
scope
of
your
argument?
because
i
had
understood
--
let's
take
the
timing
question
aside
for
a
minute.
let's
--
let's
assume
that
you
had
filed
this
suit
after
title
had
transferred.
i
had
understood
that
your
argument
was,
yes,
you
should
be
allowed
to
do
that
because,
even
though
this
was
filed
after
title
had
transferred,
yours
is
just
not
a
quiet
title
action,
and
it's
not
a
quiet
title
action
because
you're
not
seeking
title
yourself.
isn't
that
the
question?
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
so
your
argument
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
timing.
your
argument
would
be
the
same
even
if
title
had
transferred
prior
to
your
filing
your
lawsuit.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
as
i
understood
your
brief,
49
pages
of
it
were
about
one
thing,
and
there's
one
footnote
that's
about
something
else.
in
other
words,
all
of
your
brief
is
basically
saying:
ours
is
just
not
a
quiet
title
action,
and
so
we
should
be
allowed
to
proceed
irrespective
of
when
the
government
acquires
title.
and
then
you
have
this
little
additional
argument
which
says:
by
the
way,
we
started
this
lawsuit
before
the
government
had
title
anyway.
so,
i
mean,
the
briefing
in
this
case
is
all
about
what
you
now
say
is
your
weakest
point.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
suppose
the
question,
mr.
nelson,
though,
is
whether
you
can
provide
us
with
a
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
what
you
call
quiet
title
suits
--
and
i
agree
that
your
definition
is
the
traditional
definition;
when
somebody
--
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
--
is
himself
asserting
a
right
or
interest
--
why
those
suits
should
be
barred,
but
your
suit
involving
a
third
party
should
not
be
barred.
what
could
possibly
be
the
reason
to
distinguish
between
those
two
sets
of
cases?
now,
you
might
just
say,
i
don't
have
to
give
you
a
reason,
this
is
what
the
result
of
the
statute
says.
but
if
i
say,
just
try
to
provide
me
with
a
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
that
distinction,
what
would
you
say?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
--
but
in
saying
that
you
have
just
broadened,
or
arguably
you
have.
if
--
if
you
think
that
the
quiet
title
action
is
really
about
the
narrower
set
of
cases,
which
is
when
a
person
himself
claims
title,
how
can
you
get
from
that
to
say
that
there
is
an
express
or
an
implied
refusal
of
--
of
this
kind
of
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
a
case
about
sovereign
immunity
and
prudential
standing,
maybe
not
what
you've
all
come
for
today.[laughter]
the
question
is
whether
to
allow
a
suit
brought
by
respondent,
david
patchak
to
proceed.
respondent
patchak
owns
property
in
rural
michigan.
he
brought
suit
when
the
department
of
interior
acquired
property
for
an
indian
tribe,
the
match-e-be-nash-she-wish
band
of
potawatomi
indians
to
enable
them
to
build
a
casino.
patchak
thinks
a
casino
will
change
the
character
of
the
area
and
cause
him
economic,
environmental,
and
aesthetic
harm
and
he
says
the
government
lacked
the
authority,
the
legal
authority,
to
acquire
this
land
under
the
indian
reorganization
act.
so,
he
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
government's
acquisition
of
the
land
by
divesting
it
of
title.
when
citizens
like
patchak
contest
the
legality
of
agency
action
and
seek
non-monetary
relief,
they
bring
a
suit
under
a
statute
called
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
apa.
that
act
contains
a
provision
waiving
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
which
is
the
legal
doctrine
that
historically
prevents
governments
from
being
sued.
but
the
apa's
waiver
of
immunity
has
an
exception,
when
another
statute
forbids
the
suit,
the
apa's
waiver
of
immunity
does
not
control.
the
tribe
and
the
government
contends
that
in
this
circumstance
another
statute
called
quiet
title
act
does
forbid
the
suit
because
they
say,
that's
statute
retains
the
government's
immunity
from
any
suits
challenging
the
government's
title
to
indian
trust
lands.
that's
the
first
question
we
address
in
this
case.
we
reject
the
government's
argument
because
we
think
the
quiet
title
act
addresses
a
different
kind
of
suit
than
the
one
patchak
brought.
the
quiet
title
act
is
about,
this
is
going
to
surprise
you,
but
the
quiet
title
act
is
about
quiet
title
actions.
and
a
quiet
title
action
is
a
very
particular
kind
of
suit
which
requires
the
person
suing
himself
to
claim
ownership
of
the
land
in
question.
if
patchak
claims
to
own
the
land
here,
the
quiet
title
act
would
control
and
it
would
indeed
bar
the
suit
because
it
prevents
quiet
title
actions
involving
indian
lands.
but
because
patchak
does
not
claim
ownership
of
the
land,
he
is
not
bringing
a
quiet
title
action
and
the
quiet
title
act
simply
has
no
application.
instead,
the
apa's
general
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
controls.
but
tribe
and
government
also
have
another
objection
to
patchak's
suit
that
he
does
not
have
what
we've
called
prudential
standing
to
bring
it.
recall
that
patchak
says
the
government
lacked
authority
to
acquire
this
property
under
the
indian
reorganization
act.
the
prudential
standing
argument
is
that
patchak
does
not
fall
within
what
we've
called
the
zone-of-interests
regulated
by
that
statute
and
so
cannot
bring
this
lawsuit.
that
argument
depends
on
the
idea
that
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
not
about
land
use,
but
only
about
land
acquisition.
if
that
were
true,
patchak
couldn't
bring
his
suit
because
it's
only
an
objection
to
the
way
the
band
is
going
--
the
tribe
is
going
to
use
the
suit.
so,
the
suit
would
not
be
sufficiently
connected
to
the
statute
that
patchak
says
was
violated,
but
here,
that's
just
not
true
and
so
we
reject
the
prudential
standing
argument,
too.
the
indian
reorganization
act
serves
to
promote
indian
economic
development.
so,
when
the
department
decides
whether
to
acquire
land
for
a
band
or
a
tribe
it
thinks
a
good
deal
about
what
the
tribe
would
do
with
that
land,
including
what
potential
conflicts
the
use
will
create
and
indeed
it
did
so
in
this
very
case.
the
upshot
is
that
because
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
about
land
use,
a
neighbor
who
objects
to
that
use
has
prudential
standing
to
bring
an
action
under
the
apa.
we
accordingly
hold
that
patchak
suit
may
proceed
and
because
that
was
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals,
we
affirm
its
judgment.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
