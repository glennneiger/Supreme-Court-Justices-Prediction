mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
classic
apa
action.
mr.
patchak
is
challenging
unlawful
agency
action.
mr.
patchak
is
not
asserting
a
quiet
title
action
where
someone
asserts
an
interest
in
property
owned
by
the
government
and
is
trying
to
get
that
property
back.
and
as
this
court
has
already
discussed,
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
the
fact
that
mr.
patchak
filed
this
suit
before
the
land
was
taken
into
trust.
the
fact
that
the
government
subsequently
took
the
land
did
not
affect
the
nature
of
mr.
patchak's
lawsuit.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
justice
ginsburg,
the
30-day
window
is
a
notice
period.
mr.
patchak
did
in
fact
file
is
lawsuit
within
the
6-year
statute
of
limitations
provided
by
congress
for
apa
claims.
and
the
reason
that
the
secretary
adopted
the
30-day
notice
provision
is
the
very
argument
that
we
believe
is
misplaced
here,
namely
that
the
quiet
title
act
springs
up
to
bar
judicial
review
after
the
land
is
taken
into
trust.
we
don't
believe
that's
the
case
because
mr.
patchak
is
not
asserting
a
quiet
title
act
action,
which
is
limited
to
those
claims
where
someone
says,
this
is
my
property
and
i
want
it
back
or,
with
regard
to
the
government,
at
least
pay
me
for
it.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
the
30-day
window
--
yes,
if
someone
was
asserting
a
quiet
title
action,
the
30-day
window
would
apply.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
certainly
it
provides
for
comments
in
that
people
can
come
and
assert
their
comments
absolutely,
but
it
doesn't
prevent
someone
from
asserting
a
lawsuit.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--it
is
the
same
claim,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
the
relief
that--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--justice
sotomayor,
mr.
patchak
is
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
decision
of
the
secretary
that
it
can
take
land
into
trust
for
this
particular
band
of
indians
is
incorrect,
and
that,
therefore,
the
decision
to
do
so
is
ultra
vires;
and
as
an
incident
to
that
relief,
now
that
the
government
has
taken
the
land
into
trust,
that
the
land
now
be
taken
out
of
trust.
that
does
not
convert
this,
though,
into
a
quiet
title
action
because
mr.
patchak
is
not
asserting
an
interest
in
the
property
itself.
the
relief
of
the
quiet
title
action
provides
--
has
two
parts.
it
both
provides
for
--
that
title
will
be
taken
from
the
government
and
that
title
will
be
quieted
in
the
plaintiff.
the
relief
that
mr.
patchak
is
seeking
does
not
include
quieting
title
in
himself.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
i
am
not
at
this
time
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
or
is
not.
i
do
know
that
we
have
cited
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
the
--
i
believe
it's
the
grupo
dataflux
case
that
indicates
that
jurisdiction
is
decided
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
is
filed.
because
the
d.c.
circuit
specifically
reserved
this
issue,
we
did
not
believe
this
issue
was
before
the
court.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
i
am
not
at
this
time
aware
of
any
cases.
i'm
not,
unfortunately,
in
a
position
to
say
that
the
cases
do
not
exist
or
do
exist.
i
believe
the
issue
was
addressed
in
the
d.c.
circuit
briefing,
but
i'm
not
aware
at
this
time
of
any
cases
that
would
--
that
address
this
specific
issue.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
exceptions.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
justice
sotomayor,
yes,
there
is
a
limit
on
who
may
assert
these
actions,
first
with
regard
to
this
court's
prudential
standing
analysis
would
obviously
provide
a
limitation,
but
second
with
regard--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
my
--
that
my
client's
niece
would
have
prudential
standing
because
i
don't
think
that
you
could
--
that
that
person
would
arguably
be
within
the
zone
of
interests
to
assert
that
claim.
i
think
that
the
zone
of
interest
test
does
exclude
people
who
might
have
article
iii
standing
from
asserting
these
types
of
claims.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
we
don't
disagree.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
only
to
the
extent
that
the
land
is
taken
as
a
result
of
administrative
action.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
the
fact
that
this
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
the
land
is
taken
into
trust
does
not
transform
the
action
into
a
quiet
title
action
simply
because
the
government--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--okay.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--once
it's
in
the
government's
hands,
it
is
--
it
does
not
--
once
the
government
acquires
the
title,
it
does
not
change
the
nature
of
the
apa
action
because
the
quiet
title
act
is
limited
to--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
what
would
happen
here,
to
our
understanding,
is
the
land
would
be
taken
out
of
trust
and
would
revert
to
the
tribe.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
as
to
what
the
status
of
the
title
was.
our
understanding
is
that--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--your
honor,
the
--
it
depends
in
part,
i
believe,
at
this
--
at
that
point,
based
on
state
law,
what
the
effect
of
the
court's
decision
would
be.
would
it
render
the
trust
status
void?
if
so,
under
michigan
law,
the
land
would
vest
in
the
intended
beneficiary,
which
is
the
tribe.
if
it
--
if
it
does
not,
if
the
entire
action
would
be
undone,
the
land
would
revert
back
to
the
prior
owner,
which,
to
the
best
of
my
understanding,
is
a
company
that
involves
ownership
both
by
a
group
of
las
vegas
investors
and
also,
to
my
understanding,
the
band
itself;
although,
i
could
be
corrected
on
that.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
the
land
itself
was
partially
agricultural
and
partially
light
manufacturing.
that
was
how
it
was
zoned.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
but
it
was
all
owned
as
a
single
parcel.
the
bradley
tract
was,
i
believe,
a
single
parcel
for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--your
honor,
we
--
we
looked
into
and
wanted
to
make
an
argument
that
somehow
you
could
separate
the
trust
title
status
and
the
federal
government's
fee
simple
interest.
and
in
looking
at
the
deed
itself,
it
doesn't
look
like
that
can
be
done.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
land--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--yes,
your
honor,
section
463
of
the
indian
gaming
act--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--correct,
we're
under
465,
our
honor.
justice
kennedy,
i
would
point
to
the
fact
that
the
land
is
authorized
to
be
taken
into
trust
for
indians;
and,
when
land
is
taken
into
trust,
it
necessarily
implicates
the
use.
and
as
soon
as
the
use
implicated,
anyone
who
is
affected
by
that
use
--
people
who
live
in
close
proximity
to
that
land
--
are
within
--
are
arguably
within
the
scope
of
those
people
who
congress
would
expect
to
enforce--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
section
465
does
not
specifically
reference
the
public
interest.
it
does,
however
--
the
intent
in
465
is
to
have
land
taken
into
trust.
and
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
separate
the
fact
that
the
land
is
being
taken
into
trust
from
the
specific
use
to
which
it
is
being
put.
congress
authorized
the
land
to
be
taken
into
trust
for
a
specific
use.
and
you
can
see,
in
fact,
that
the
government
has
reached
the
same
conclusion.
when
you
look
at
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
has
adopted
in
consideration
of
section
465,
they
not
only
address
land
use,
the
tribe
has
to
identify
the
use
to
which
the
land
will
be
put,
but
they
also
require
the
tribe
to
identify
any
conflicts
of
land
use,
which
clearly
addresses
the
fact
that
other
people
are
going
to
be
affected
by
the
land
use.
consequently,
those
--
and
we
believe
those
--
those
regulations
are
subject
to
chevron
deference
because
they
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
delegated
to
the
secretary,
and
they
don't
conflict
with
the
broad
delegation
there
in
the
--
in
section
465.
so--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--your
honor,
in
fact,
the
apa
reserves
the
laches
defense,
and
the
laches
defense
has
been
asserted
here.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
casino
hadn't
--
the
casino
did
not
open
and
they
did
not
move
forward
with
this
until
after
the
land
was
taken
into
trust,
which
was
six
months
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
at
that
point,
in
spite
of
the
knowledge
of
this
court's
decision
in
carcieri,
they
made
a
reasonable
business
decision
to
move
forward
with
this,
knowing
the
risk
that
they
were
taking
that
the
entire
basis
of
them
being
able
to
operate
a
casino
and
engage
in
class
3
gambling
could
be
overturned.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
no,
your
honor.
they
knew
that
our
suit
had
been
filed--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--correct.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
is
a
logical
result;
but,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
address
that
issue
in
this
case
because
our
argument
is
much
stronger
than
that
because
we
did,
in
fact,
file
suit
before
the
land
was
taken
into
trust.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
that
it
is
our
weakest
point,
but
i
do
agree
that
the
--
that
the
logic
here
of
the
position
that
this
is
not
a
quiet
title
act
action
means
that
even
if
the
government
acquires
title
to
the
land
while
the
suit
is
pending,
that,
logically,
it
would
then
follow
that
the
action
remains
an
apa
action,
and
it
is
not
converted
into
a
quiet
title
action.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
there
was
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
i
believe
it
was
united
states
v.
south
dakota
or
south
dakota
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
court
there
found
that
the
lack
of
judicial
review
pushed
towards
the
conclusion
that
the
reorganization
act
is
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
or
that
was
the
reason
cited
in
the
federal
register
for
why
the
department
of
interior
adopted
the
30-day
notice
provision.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
the
quiet
title
act
by
its
terms
requires
that
the
person
who
is
asserting
the
action
had
an
interest
in
the
property.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
anyone--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--no,
your
honor.
the
defenses
would
be
laches,
the
zone
of
interest
would
apply,
other
--
any
other
defense--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
distinction
i
think
has
to
be
made
there.
the
--
someone
who
has
a
right,
title,
or
interest
in
the
property,
absent
there
being
trust
land,
can
sue
to
upset
the
government's
title
for
12
years
under
the
quiet
title
act.
they
could
bring
a
claim
under
the
apa
for
up
to
6
years
to
govern
the
--
or
to
challenge
the
government's
decision
to
take
the
land--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--under
the
quiet
title
act
they
can
only
--
for
the
12-year
period
they
can
only
undo
--
they
can
--
excuse
me.
the
government,
if
they
prevail,
the
government,
correct,
has
the
option
of
deciding
whether
to
pay
for
the
land
or
to
--
to
give
it
up.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor,
i
guess
i
would
first
say
that
because
relief
under
the
apa
is
different
than
relief
under
the
quiet
title
act,
someone
with
a
right,
title
or
interest
in
the
property
can
assert
the
same
claim
that
mr.
patchak
can,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
that
right,
title
or
interest,
under
the
apa,
as
long
as
they
do
not
seek
under
the
apa
to
quiet
title
in
themselves.
second,
with
regard
to
why
this
provision
would
--
this
provision
is
there
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
have
to
acknowledge
i've
lost
track
of
your
question.
have
i
responded
or
can
you
restate
it?
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
your
honor--
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
--that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
injury,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
t.
nelson
or
to
pay
him
for
it,
yes,
your
honor.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
cede
the
remainder
of
my
time.
