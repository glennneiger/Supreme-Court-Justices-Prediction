chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-246,
match-e-be-nash-she-wish
band
of
pottawatomi
indians
v.
patchak.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
interrupt,
in
other
words,
it's
not
just
to
the
title.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
hear.
i
mean,
when
patchak
filed
his
suit
title
had
not
yet
passed
to
the
secretary.
and
he
sought
a
stay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
nothing
--
at
that
point,
you
thought
nothing
prevented
the
secretary
from
moving
forward,
and
in
fact
the
secretary
did
move
forward
even
though
he
had
already
filed
the
suit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
say,
just
for
a
moment,
let's
suppose
the
tribe
--
the
--
mr.
patchak
brings
a
nuisance
action
against
the
tribe
for
running
a
casino
and
imposing
all
these
difficulties
on
the
surrounding
previously
rural
community.
he
says
this
is
a
nuisance.
and
the
tribe
answers
and
says:
no,
we
can
do
this
under
the
indian
gaming
regulation
act.
and
patchak
then
says:
well,
no,
because
you
don't
have
valid
authority
under
that
act
because
the
secretary
shouldn't
have
taken
the
land
into
title.
now,
that
is
not
a
quiet
title
action.
that
is
a
nuisance
action.
can
he
have
that
adjudicated
in
that
suit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
there'd
be
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--question
of
his
ability
to
sue
and
put
that
question
at
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
a
question
that's
not
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
solicitor
general
in
footnote
1
of
his
reply
brief
says
that's
the
general
rule,
which
i
take
it
there
might
be
exceptions
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i'm
sure
he'll
tell
us
what
those
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
proposition
would
be
simply
that
the
government
can't
go
in
and
--
and
moot
out
a
suit
that
was
--
by
its
unilateral
action,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
they
seem
to
recognize
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing,
since
it's
only
by
their
grace,
they've
told
us,
that
they
don't
do
it
right
away
anyway.
they
give
people
30
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
miller,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
other
consequences
other
than
the
ability
of
the
secretary
to
take
land
in
trust
flow
from
whether
or
not
a
tribe
is
recognized
in
1934?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
miller,
i
mentioned
earlier
your
footnote
1
in
your
reply
brief
about
whether
the
time
of
filing
question
for
sovereign
immunity
purposes
is
limited
to
diversity
cases.
are
there
--
you
cite
one
case.
are
there
others
going
the
other
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
this
suit
would
come
out
the
other
way
if
the
person
objecting
was
just
over
the
border
in
--
in
indiana,
instead
of
in
michigan?
because
there
would
be
--
it
could
be
brought
as
a
diversity
suit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
assuming--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
it
were
a
suit
against
the
tribe,
it
would
still
be
not
a
diversity
action
but
a
federal
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
number
11-246,
match-e-be-nash-she-wish
band
of
potawatomi
indians
v.
patchak.
justice
kagan
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
