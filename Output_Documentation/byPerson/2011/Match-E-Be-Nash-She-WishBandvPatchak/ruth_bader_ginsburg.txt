justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
be
true
of
mr.
patchak?
suppose
he
had
filed
in
the
30-day
window.
the
secretary
gives
notice
to
affected
persons.
so
he
comes
in
and
he
says:
i
think
that
you
don't
have
authority
to
do
it
because
this
tribe
wasn't
under
federal
jurisdiction,
and
so
i
want
you
to
call
--
call
it
off.
nothing
--
nothing
has
been
transferred
within
30
days.
i
thought
both
your
brief
and
the
tribe's
brief
said
that
the
judicial
review
would
be
available
to
any
affected
person
who
used
that
procedure.
is
that
--
is
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
--
you
said
it
was
important
if.
so
the
argument
is
this
tribe
wasn't
under
federal
jurisdiction.
i
could
raise
that
because
i'm
an
affected
person.
somebody's
got
to
be
able
to
enforce
against
the
secretary
the
limitations
that
congress
put
on
the
secretary.
so
would
there
be
standing
in
that
situation?
mr.
patchak
comes
in
within
the
30-day
period,
so
he's
not
trying
to
undo
any
done
deal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you
disagree
with
the
tribe
that
said
in
no
uncertain
terms,
in
its
reply
brief,
that
this
case
is
not
about
the
availability
of
judicial
review.
judicial
review
was
available
in
the
30-day
window.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
didn't
file
it
within
the
30-day
window,
so
that
--
that
is
--
there
was
a
clear
track.
he
could
have
filed
within
30
days,
and
at
least
the
government
tells
us
that
that
would
have
been
subject
to
judicial
review,
the
ruling
made
within
--
that
nothing
would
go
on
until
that
action
was
cleared.
so
why,
if
he
could
have
sued
early,
before
any
title
transfer,
why
isn't
that
all
the
relief
someone
in
his
position
would
be
entitled
to?
why
should
he
be
allowed
to
wait?
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
30-day
window
is
to
get
people
to
state
their
objections.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
answers
that
that's
in
diversity.
you
know,
you
determine
citizenship
as
of
the
date
the
complaint
is
filed.
citizenship
of
a
party
changes,
so
if
it
coincides
with
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
it
doesn't
matter.
but
do
you
have
cases
other
than
diversity
cases
where
the
filing
of
the
complaint
--
nothing
happens,
nothing
that
can
happen
after
affects
the
jurisdiction
as
set
as
of
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed?
i
don't
know
outside
diversity
where
this
principle
has
applied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
the
government
told
us
that
the
land
didn't
belong
to
the
tribe
in
the
first
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
government
did
say
that
the
band
was
not
the
prior
owner
of
the
tract.
so
where
would
it
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
they
--
wasn't
--
didn't
they
have
some
encouragement
from
a
court
of--
appeals
suggesting
there
might
be
a
due
process
problem
if
they
didn't
have
that
notice?
