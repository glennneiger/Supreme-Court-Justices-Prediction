mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
suit
in
this
case
suffers
from
two
independent
jurisdictional
defects,
either
one
of
which
provides
a
basis
for
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
first
is
that
the
united
states
has
not
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
from
suits
challenging
its
title
to
indian
trust
lands.
and
the
second
is
that
patchak,
the
plaintiff,
lacks
prudential
standing
because
the
interests
that
he
seeks
to
vindicate
in
the
suit
are
not
within
the
zone
of
interests
protected
or
regulated
by
section
5
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
provision
whose
alleged
violation
forms
the
basis
for
his
complaint.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there
are
--
there
are
two
parts
to
that.
and
taking
the
timing
question
first,
the
claim
would
have
to
be
brought
before
the
land
was
taken
into
trust.
and
that's
why
the
regulations
set
out
a
30-day
period
after
the
announcement
of
the
intent
to
take
the
land
into
trust
before
title
is
actually
transferred.
so
somebody
would
have
to
file
during
that
period,
as
the
michgo
plaintiffs
did--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--and
the
proper
plaintiff
for
a
claim
under
section
5
--
and,
of
course,
there
can
be
other
claims
under
nepa
or
the
igra
--
but
under
section
5
of
the
ira,
the
proper
plaintiff
would
be
a
state
or
local
government
because
those
are
the
entities
that
are
directly
affected,
directly
regulated
by
the
transfer
of
jurisdiction
to
the
tribe--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
as
the
beneficiaries
of
section
5,
the
parties
for
whose
benefit
congress
acted
and
the
secretary
would
be
acting,
i
think
in
that
scenario
a
tribe
would
have
standing
to
challenge
it.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the
challenge
in
that
case
was
--
was
not
just
to
the
use.
it
was
to
the
decision
to
take
title
to
land
into
trust.
and
the
secretary's
policy,
as
set
out
in--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
was
a
nepa
claim,
for
example.
and
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
the
michgo
organization,
alleged
that
the
secretary
had
not
complied
with
nepa,
had
not
adequately
considered
the
environmental
consequences
of
the
action
to
take
the
land
into
trust.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
that's
--
that
is
true.
and
it
is
also
true
that
nepa
may
in
some
circumstances
require
consideration
of
the
use
for
which
the
land
is
to
be
put;
but,
it
doesn't
follow
that
section
5
requires
or
contemplates
protecting
the
interests
of
nearby
landowners
from
the
use.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
i
mean,
that
was
--
the
allegation--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right,
but
what
--
what
michgo
was
seeking,
what
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
in
that
case,
was
an
injunction
barring
the
transfer.
and
the
secretary's
policy
--
the
whole
point
of
the
30-day
regulation
is
to
allow
people
who
want
to
challenge
the
transfer
to
have
a
full
opportunity
to
litigate
those
claims.
and
that
is
why--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
if
they
could
establish
standing,
but
--
if
he
had
filed
within
the
30-day
period,
the
secretary
would
not
take
title
to
the
land
until
there
was
a
full
opportunity
for
judicial
review.
now,
in
this
case,
he
filed
outside
the
30-day
period.
he
was
aware--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
would
not
be
standing
for
patchak
as
a
private
individual,
but
there
would
be
standing
for
a
state
or
local
government
or,
in
the
unusual
situation
that
justice
sotomayor
suggested,
for
another
tribe--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
we
don't
disagree
with
that
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
the
sovereign
immunity
issue.
i
don't
understand
that
statement
in
the
tribe's
brief
to
have
been
a
concession
that
there
would
have
been
standing.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
it
is
a
land
use
statute
in
--
in
this
sense,
in
the
sense
that
--
and
you're
right
that
the
regulations
do
refer
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
land
is
to
be
used,
but
that's
because--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that
is
exactly
right.
and
that's
why,
in
determining
whether
--
the
secretary
has
to
take
account
of
use
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
will,
in
fact,
serve
the
interest
of
promoting
tribal
economic
development
and
self-governance,
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
effect
of
that
use
on
bystanders,
on
other
property
owners
in
the
vicinity,
is
within
the
interests
that
congress
had
in
mind--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--because
--
i
mean,
just
to
take
the
facts
of
this
case
as
an
example,
you
know,
patchak's
objection
is
not
to
the
jurisdictional
transfer.
it's
not
to
the
fact
that
this
is
now
going
to
be
tribal
land
rather
than
land
subject
to
the
taxing
or
regulatory
authority
of
the
state
of
michigan
or
allegan
county--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
mean
--
that
is
--
the
relief
he
is
trying
to
get
is
to
undo
that,
but
the
--
the
injury
doesn't
come
from
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
injury
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
land
is
going
to
be
used
for
gaming,
but
in
1934--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
for
the
zone
of
interest
test,
the
question
would
be
are
people
who
may
be
adversely
affected
by
gaming
on
indian
land
within
the
zone
of
interest
--
is
that
interest
arguably
something
that
--
congress
was
speaking
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
believe
that
in
applying
to
have
the
land
taken
into
trust,
the
tribe
said
what--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
wanted
to
happen.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
regulations
do
not
address
that.
the
bia
manual
provides
that
that
action,
of
taking
the
land
into
trust,
should
not
be
taken
while
the
litigation
is
pending.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
not
be,
but
i
think
that
--
i
guess
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
the
first
is
that
the
secretary
enacted
these
regulations,
the
30-day
notice
rule,
precisely
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
there
would
be
an
adequate
opportunity
for
judicial
review
and
thus
removing
the
constitutional
doubt
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
found
associated
with
the
ira.
and
i
think
--
so
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
the
secretary
is
going
to
conscientiously
carry
out
what
those
regulations
provide
for,
which
is
allowing
judicial
review.
and
if
the
secretary
were
ever
to
do
that,
i
think
he
would
find
that
going
forward
in
every
case,
courts
would
enter
a
stay.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
and
--
and
it
was
--
it
was
denied,
and
he
could
have
sought
relief
from
the
court
of
appeals,
and
he
didn't.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that
--
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
because
this
was
a
suit
that
was
not
filed
within
the
30-day
period.
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--they--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right.
well
--
and
in
that
period
before
the
land
is
taken
into
trust,
the
apa,
everyone
agrees,
permits,
permits
that
litigation.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
because
at
this
point
the
question
of
whether
to
enjoin
the
transfer
from
taking
place
is
moot.
because--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
relief
that's
being
sought
now
--
and
this
is
made
clear
in
patchak's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
is
an
order
compelling
the
secretary
to
relinquish
the
title
to
the
land.
and
so
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
the
time
to
seek
review
of
whether
to
enjoin
a
not-yet-completed
transfer
is
before
the
transfer
is
completed.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but
--
and
if
he
wanted
to
appeal
the
district
court's
denial
of
that
injunction,
he
could
have
done
so
as
of
right
under--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--he
did
not
appeal
the
denial
of
the
injunction.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--with
--
with
respect,
your
honor,
once
the
land
is
taken
into
trust,
the
--
the
only
effective
relief
would
be
an
order
taking
the
land
out
of
trust,
and
that's
what
brings
this
within
the
scope
of
the
qta.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
we
--
we
think
it's
--
it's
not
properly
before
the
court.
but
one
thing
i
would
just
say
about
that
is
it
is
not
remarkable,
or
it
often
happens
that,
as
the
nature
of
the
claims
or
the
identity
of
the
parties
changes
throughout
the
course
of
litigation,
sovereign
immunity
can
bar
a
suit
that
wouldn't
have
been
barred
before.
and
one
example
of
that
is
under
the
westfall
act.
somebody
sues
an
officer
of
the
united
states
for
a
tort,
that
suit
can
go
forward,
but
if
the
attorney
general
then
certifies
under
the
westfall
act
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
duties,
then
it
gets
converted
into
an
action
against
the
united
states,
which
might,
if
it
falls
within
one
of
the
ftca
exceptions,
be
brought--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
but
that
--
that's
just
an
example
of
how,
as
--
as
the
parties,
or
the
relief
--
here
it's
the
relief
--
changes,
sovereign
immunity
can
bar
an
action.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
i
understand
correctly,
you're
asking
about
the
case
where
the
--
the
lawsuit
is
filed
before
the
land
has
been
transferred.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
know
of
any
basis
for
restricting
the
government's
ability
to
do
that,
i
mean,
short
of
the
plaintiffs
obtaining
an
injunction
from
the
court.
i
guess
the
broader
point
i
would
make
about
that
timing
question
is
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that
is
our
position.
i
would
just
emphasize
that
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
--
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
doesn't
matter
when
the
suit
is
filed,
and
under
the
court's
analysis--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
would
be
exactly
the
same,
even
if
it
was
filed
later.
and
i
think
the
--
the
error
in
that
analysis
is
--
is
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
patchak's
suit
is
a
quiet
title
act
action.
the
question
is
whether
the
quiet
title
act
expressly
or
impliedly
precludes
relief
under
section
702,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
and
i'd
just
like
to
make
two
points
about
that.
the
first
is
that
the
general
principle
recognized
by
this
court
in
brown
v.
gsa
and
a
number
of
other
cases
is
that
when
you
have
a
narrowly
drawn
remedial
scheme
for
a
particular
subject,
that
that
precludes
resort
to
more
general
remedies.
and
here
the
quiet
title
act
is
exactly
such
a
scheme.
it's
the
mechanism
for
adjudicating
a
disputed
title
to
real
property
in
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest,
and
it
has
its
own
procedures,
its
own
statute
of
limitation--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
for
two
reasons.
and
the
first
is,
just
that
--
that
first
sentence
of
2409a(a),
which
is,
you
know,
to
adjudicate
a
disputed
title
to
land
on
which
the
united
states
claims
an
interest.
that's
a
perfect
description
of
what
this
case
is.
and
the
second
is
that
the
last
sentence
of
section
702
directs
our
attention
to
whether
the
relief
is
expressly
or
impliedly
forbidden
by
another
statute.
and
the
relief
that
is
sought
here
is
an
order
compelling
the
secretary
to
relinquish
title
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
this
land.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
aren't
any
others,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
this
action
would
be
barred
under
the
quiet
title
act
because
the
quiet
title
act
expressly
precludes
this
relief,
where
--
where
indian
trust
land
is
at
issue,
where
the
relief
that's
sought
is
an
injunction
compelling
relinquishment
of
title
without
the
option
of
paying
damages--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
and
the
quiet
title
act,
section
(d)
requires
in
a
suit
under
the
quiet
title
act
the
plaintiff
to
identify
his
interest
in
the
land.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i'm
not
aware
of
others,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
can't
say
with
confidence
that
there
aren't
any
others.
one
point
i
would
make
on
that
is
just
refer
you
to
the
florida
prepaid
case
from
1998,
which
was
about
state
sovereign
immunity
and
which
explained
that
a
state
may
condition
its
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
may
change
that
in
the
course
of
the
litigation.
and
i
think
that's
another
analogy
that
might
be
instructive
here.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
it
would--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
would
be
still
be
--
sovereign
immunity
would
still
apply.
sovereign
immunity
would
bar
relief,
even
if
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
were
diversity
rather
than--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--our
point
is
that
the
reason
it's
barred
is
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
when
--
the
time
of
filing
in
diversity
cases
refers
to
if
the
citizenship
of
the
parties
changes
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
that
doesn't
--
my
understanding
is
that
doesn't
defeat
diversity.
that's
the
nature
of
that
exception.
