mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fair
sentencing
act
manifests
the
requisite
fair
and
necessary
implication
that
congress
intended
that
its
new
mandatory
minimum
thresholds
apply
in
all
sentencings
after
the
date
of
the
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
first
of
all--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
do,
justice
sotomayor.
although
this
court
has
not
used
the
words
109,
it
has
used
the
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
no
dispute
here,
i
don't
think,
that
there
is
a
--
a
lack
of
an
express
statement
in
the
act.
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
as
justice
scalia
explained
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
lockhart
v.
united
states,
one
congress
cannot
impose
standards
of
how
another
congress
is
to
enact
legislation.
the
subsequent
congress
is
free
to
choose
how
it
will
express
its
will
in
the
language
or
structure
that
it
sees
fit.
and
i'd
like
to
give
an
example--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
of
course
not,
justice
kennedy.
but
these--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it
provides
a
background
presumption
that
overcomes
the
common
law
rule
of
abatement,
under
which,
if
congress
had
amended
a
statute,
all
prosecutions
under
the
prior
statute
would
be
deemed
to
be
a
nullity
and
they
would
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
made
clear
in
not
only
the
section
109
cases,
but
i
think,
as
my
colleague
mentioned
in
marcello
v.
bonds,
that
there
are
no
magical
passwords
that
congress
has
to
use
to
explain
itself.
and
let
me
give
an
example
because
i
think
that
it
will
help
to
put
in
focus
why
i
think
the
fair
sentencing
act
does
contain
the
requisite
implication.
if
congress
had
written
in
the
fair
sentencing
act
"henceforth
after
the
date
of
this
act,
probation
officers
shall
prepare
pre-sentence
reports
and
submit
them
to
courts
in
which
they
shall
calculate
the
mandatory
minimum
penalties
under
the
standards
announced
in
this
act.
"
i
think
this
court
would
draw
the
structural
inference
that
it
did
not
intend
that
probation
officers
prepare
that
information
for
nothing.
they
intended
that
it
be
prepared
so
that
sentencing
courts
would
use
those
new
mandatory--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
--
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it
is
because
there
is
a
piece
of
the
--
that
--
that
section
that
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to,
because
i
think
that
it
critically
explains
what
the
sentencing
commission
was
supposed
to
do.
section
8
is
all
over
the
briefs,
but
i
have
it
in
the
government's
gray
brief
at
page
10a.
this
is
the
section
that
directs
the
sentencing
commission
to
promulgate
new
guidelines
and
to
exercise
its
emergency
authority
--
and
i'm
going
to
quote
here
--
"to
make
such
conforming
amendments
to
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
as
the
commission
deems
necessary
to
achieve
consistency
with
other
guidelines
provisions.
"
--and
here's
the
critical
phrase
--
"applicable
law".
that
phrase,
2
and
3
of
the
fair
sentencing
act,
which
are
the
provisions
that
increased
the
thresholds
of
quantities
necessary
to
trigger
the
mandatory
minimum
sentences.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
want
to
put
this
in
the
structural
context
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
the
sentencing
reform
act
directs
courts
to
apply
the
version
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
that
is
in
effect
on
the
day
of
sentencing.
it's
not
a
time
of
offense
rule;
it's
a
time
of
sentencing
rule.
and
there
--
that
means
that
everybody
who
comes
before
the
sentencing
court
after
the
date
of
the
fair
sentencing
act
when
the
new
guidelines
are
in
place
will
have
those
guidelines
applied
to
those
defendants.
those
guidelines
are
supposed
to
be
conformed
to
applicable
law.
the
only
applicable
law
that
there
could
be
is
the
new
mandatory
minimum
standard.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
that
would
mean,
justice
scalia,
that
the
guidelines
would
not
be
conformed
to
applicable
law
for
the
defendants
who
are
sentenced
after
the
fsa.
they
would
be
conformed
to
inapplicable
law.
and
congress
knew
when
it
set
up
section
3553(a)
that
the
guidelines
that
would
be
applied
are
the
ones
that
are
in
force
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
was
a
little
bit
more
complex
than
that,
because
what
--
what
the
fsa
did
was
two
things:
it
lowered
of
the
mandatory
minimums
by
increasing
the
crack
thresholds,
and
it
targeted
role
in
the
offense
of
the
defendant
for
increased
sentencing
and
mitigating
factors
for
decreased
sentencing.
and
the
commission
had
to
translate
that
into
new
guidelines.
it
acted
quickly.
it
was
told
to
act
as
soon
as
practicable.
it
was
entirely
possible
under
the
statute,
and
probably
would
have
been
desired
by
congress,
that
new
guidelines
would
have
gone
into
effect
on
august
4th.
at
that
point
the
only
people
in
front
of
the
sentencing
court
would
have
been
pre-fsa
offenders.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
necessarily.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
roughly
speaking,
there
has
been
historically
been
about
5,000
crack
offenders
a
year.
so
that
means
that,
come--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
put
in
the
brief
the
figures
from
the
administrative
office
of
the
u.s.
courts,
which
indicate
that
the
median
figure
is
around
11
months,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
reluctant
to
guess,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
there
--
there
will
probably
be
thousands
of
crack
defendants
who
will
be
sentenced
under
the
old
mandatory
minimums
that
congress
repealed
because
they
were
perceived
as
being
racially
disparate
and
unfair,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
congress
balanced
numerically--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
making
an
absurdity
argument,
justice
breyer.
the
argument
that
i'm
making
is
that
when
congress
directed
the
commission--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
conform
the
guidelines
to
applicable
law,
the
only
applicable
law
that
it
could
have
had
in
mind--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
they
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
sentencing
reform
act
--
it
doesn't
make
perfect
sense,
because
the
sentencing
reform
act
is
set
up
to
apply
new
guidelines
to
people
based
on
date
of
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
everybody.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--let
me
refer
to
the
statute
because
the
statute
answers
this
question
differently
than
the
way
your
honor
has
assumed
it
works,
okay?
on
page
30a
of
our
appendix
we
reproduce
section
3553(a),
and
3353(a)(4)
establishes
that
when
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--30a
--
i'm
sorry,
39a.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
sorry
about
that.
the
--
the
sentencing
reform
act
provides
that
the
applicable
set
of
guidelines
that
will
be
applied
are
those
that
are
in
effect
on
the
date
that
the
defendant
is
sentenced.
this
is
3553(a)(4)(a)(ii).
and
that
provision
has
been
in
the
sentencing
reform
act
since
the
--
since
the
time
the
sentencing
reform
act
was
enacted.
and
congress
explained,
for
those
who
read
legislative
history,
that
it
wanted
--
and
i
am
going
to
quote
here
from
the
legislative
history:
"the
guidelines
and
policy
statements
to
be
applied
are
those
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
"
congress's
reason
for
that
was
it
wanted
the
most
sophisticated
statements
available
that
will
most
appropriately
carry
out
the
purposes
of
sentencing,
and
to
impose
a
sentence
under
outmoded
guidelines
will
foster
irrationality
in
sentencing
and
would
be
contrary
to
the
goal
of
consistency
in
sentencing.
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
provides
that
if
a
case
is
reversed
on
appeal
and
sent
back
for
resentencing,
the
original
set
of
guidelines
that
were
applied
at
the
date
of
the
initial
sentencing
shall
be
used.
it's
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
first
of
all
justice
alito,
what
that
bill
would
have
done
is
postpone
the
effective
date
for
180
days
so
that
there
could
be
synchronicity
between
the
guidelines
and
the
new
mandatory
minimums.
the
retroactivity
that
it
was
concerned
about
would
have
reopened
final
sentences.
there's
no
question
here
about
reopening
final
sentences.
so
that
bill
was
explicit:
we
don't
want
to
reopen
final
sentences.
the
government
is
not
asking
for
reopening
of
final
sentences.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
that
bill
was
designed
to
postpone
the
effective
date
for
180
days.
i
think
everyone
in
congress
understood
that
these
guidelines
had
undermined
the
credibility
of
the
criminal
justice
system
for
years.
the
sentencing
commission
had
four
times
submitted
reports
to
congress
that
bemoaned
the
fact
that
they
were
not
only
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
that's
part
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
from
the
beginning
of
the
guidelines.
it
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
was--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i'm
saying
that
the
background
principle
that
our
legislators
are
familiar
with
the
law
surely
applies
to
sentencing
law;
and
congress
understood
that
once
the
new
guidelines
were
in
effect,
which
it
wanted
to
happen
as
soon
as
practicable,
they
would
be
applied
to
all
defendants
in
the
system
based
on
time
of
--
of
sentencing,
not
time
of
offense.
and
it
wanted
those
guidelines
to
be
conformed
to
applicable
law.
and
it
is
very
strange
to
say
that
it
wanted
new
guidelines
in
effect
to
be
conformed
to
inapplicable
law
such
that
there
would
be
the
incongruous
result
that
the
new
guidelines
that
finally
fixed
this
egregious
problem
in
the
criminal
justice
system
would
be
irrelevant
for
many
defendants
because
they
would
still
be
living
under
the
100-to-1
racially
disparate
effect
of
the
guidelines,
of
these--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
sotomayor,
what's
unique
about
this
context
is
that
there's
a
confluence
between
the
way
that
the
guidelines
treated
crack
and
the
way
that
the
statutes
treated
crack.
and
for
years
the
sentencing
commission
had
said:
we
can't
fix
this
problem
with
the
guidelines
alone;
we
need
the
help
of
congress
to
alter
the
mandatory
minimums.
and
once
you
do
that,
give
us
emergency
authority
so
that
we
can
put
new
guidelines
into
place
that
will
work
hand-in-glove
with
the
new
mandatory
minimums,
as
the
chief
justice
explained,
so
that
all
defendants
who
come
before
the
court
will
not
be
subject
to
the
discredited
crack
policy
that
congress
had
repealed.
