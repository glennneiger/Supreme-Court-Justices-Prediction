justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
is
a
fair
implication
enough?
you're
talking
here
about
a
repealer,
essentially,
of
an
earlier
provision,
section
109.
and
our
cases
uniformly
say
that
it
--
it
has
to
be
clear
implication,
unquestionable
implication.
do
you
think
this
is
really
clear
and
unquestionable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
really
troubled
by
"fair
implication"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
many
--
how
many
cases
do
you
have
that
say
"fair
implication"
as
opposed
to
quite
a
few
that
say
"clear
and
unquestionable
implication"?
marrero?
is
that
--
is
that
the
one
case
you
rely
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
a
footnote
in
marrero,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
marcello?
where
--
what's
the
cite
for
that?
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
earlier
cases
that
make
it
clear
when
you're
repealing
a
prior
statute
if
it
isn't
express,
it
has
to
be
at
least
a
clear
implication.
and
i'm
--
i'm
astounded
to
think
that
in
a
footnote,
we're
suddenly
going
to
change
that
to
simply
"fair
implication".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
question.
and
we
can
talk
about
that.
but
how
did
marrero
come
out?
did
it
--
did
it
find
an
overruling
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
did
not
find
109
overcome
by
fair
implication,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
entirely
dictum,
right?
and
dictum
in
a
footnote?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
the
other
way.
the
holding
was
that
109
governed.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
the
holding
was
that
section
109
governed,
that
it
had
not
been
repealed.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
and,
therefore,
whatever
it
said
about
what
is
necessary
for
repeal
of
109
was
purely
dictum,
because
it
held
that
109
was
not
repealed.
so,
even
if
fair
implication
was
the
test,
it
was
not
the
test
applied
and
determinative
in
the
case.
so
it's
dictum.
and
dictum
in
a
footnote.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
not
sure
he's
arguing
that.
i
think
he
acknowledges,
as
our
opinions
say,
that
it
can
be
done
by
implication,
but
it
has
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable
implication.
i
think
that's
the
position
he's
taking.
anyway,
you
want
to
tell
me
why
this
is
clear
and
unmistakable?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
and
i
think
we
would
come
out
that
way.
i
think
you
are
entirely
right.
but
the
accelerated
--
the
direction
to
the
guidelines
commission
to
promulgate
the
guidelines
on
a
--
on
an
emergency
basis
is
not,
as
you
just
put
it,
for
nothing.
it
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
justice
alito
was
suggesting,
it
has
some
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
--
it's
not
comparable
to
--
to
what
you've
just
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
but
--
but
it
--
they
apply
that
applicable
law
to
those,
as
you
say,
admittedly
few
people
who
have
been
prosecuted,
convicted,
and
are
now
being
sentenced
under
that
applicable
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
not
be
many
of
them,
but
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
deprive
that
language
of
all
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
you
are
begging
the
question.
the
--
the
law
applicable
to
pre
--
pre-statute
offenses
continues
to
be
the
prior
law,
and
the
applicable
law
to
offenses
that
have
occurred
after
the
enactment
date
is
--
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--new
guidelines
to
what
people?
that's
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
only
new
--
you're--
begging
the
question
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
--
if
it's
only
to
people
who
have
committed
their
offenses
after
that
act,
then
you
have
one
set
of
applicable
guidelines
for
those
people,
and
you
leave
in
effect,
for
people
who
committed
their
offense
before
the
--
the
enactment
date,
the
prior
guidelines.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
necessarily
implied
by
--
by
this
provision
to
the
effect
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
only
in
the
future
one
set
of
guidelines
applied,
you
know,
one
guideline
fits
all.
i
don't
think
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
30a?
justice
antonin
scalia
39a.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
section
3742(g),
which
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
but
i
mean
--
yes,
that's
very
nice,
but
let's
talk
about
text,
not
what
about
the
emotions
of
congress.
this
section
that
you
quoted,
(a)
--
what,
(4)(a)(ii)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
section
3553(a)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
in
the
new
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
in
effect--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
not
the
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
didn't
insert
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
it
made
this
amendment.
you're
just
saying
that
that
is
the
incidental
effect
of
the
provision
that
congress
did
adopt?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
find
that
extraordinary,
that
they
say
it's
racist
but
we
are
going
to
leave
in
effect
all
of
the
sentences
that
have
previously
been
imposed.
that
seems
to
me
very
unlikely.
mr.
estrada,
i
would
like
you
to
explain
the
effect
of
353(a)(4)(a)(ii)
which
--
which
does
seem
to
--
to
be
sure,
it's
not
in
the
new
legislation,
but
it's
the
background
against
which
the
new
legislation
was
adopted,
and
it
seems
to
require
that
the
court
use
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
that
about
any
statute
that
runs
afoul
of
--
of
section
109.
i
mean,
that's
what
section
109
says:
even
though
we
have
decided
that
this
old
law
is
bad
and
the
penalty
should
be
lesser,
even
though
we
have
decided,
when
we
do
that
you
continue
to
apply
the
bad
old
penalty
to
people
who
committed
a
crime
before
the
amendment.
isn't
that
what
--
what
109
says?
