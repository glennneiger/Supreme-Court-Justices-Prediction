do
you
think
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--do
you
think
that
if
we
stick
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
if
we
are,
indeed,
looking
for
an
express
provision,
do
you
agree
that
there
isn't
any
here?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
estrada,
i
mean,
that's
true,
that
it
took
congress
a
long
time
to
decide
to
do
this,
and
the
question
is,
once
having
decided
to
do
this,
what
did
it
decide
to
do;
and
whether
it
would
make
sense,
once
having
decided
to
do
this,
to
have
the
guidelines
be
the
new
guidelines,
but
the
mandatory
minimums
be
the
old
mandatory
minimums.
and
what
everybody
understood
was
that
if
that
were
the
case,
if
the
new
guidelines
and
the
old
mandatory
minimums
sort
of
--
both
applied
together,
it
would
lead
to
ridiculous
disparities
in
the
way
people
were
sentenced.
and
so
the
question
is,
once
having
decided
to
do
this,
can't
we
assume
that
congress
decided
to
do
it?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
begs
the
question--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
estrada,
before
you
do,
if
i
can
understand
your
argument
as
it
relates
to
justice
scalia's
questions
--
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
there's
a
person
who
has
4.99
grams
of
crack
cocaine.
and
you
do
not
dispute,
do
you,
that
that
person
would
be
subject
to
the
new
guidelines,
which
are
based
on
the
18-to-1
ratio
rather
than
the
100-to-1
ratio?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
you
do
not
dispute
that.
so
--
so
then
we're
living
in
a
world
in
which
the
person
who
has
4.99
grams
of
cocaine
is
getting
the
18-to-1
ratio,
and
a
person
who
has
5
grams
is
getting
the
100-to-1
ratio
that's
embedded
in
the
mandatory
minimums.
justice
elena
kagan
now,
when
judge
easterbrook
talked
about
this
anomaly
--
and
he,
of
course,
adopted
the
position
that
you
adopted.
but
he
just
said,
look,
there
is
no
earthly
reason
for
this.
it's
just
that
we
can't
find
a
clear
enough
statement
in
the
statute.
i
guess
the
question
i
would
ask
you
is:
can
you
do
better
than
judge
easterbrook?
can
you
find
an
earthly
reason
for
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
create
this
weird
halfway
system
in
which
you
if
you
have
4-1/2
grams
of
cocaine,
one
rule
applies,
but
if
you
have
5
grams,
another
rule
applies?
justice
elena
kagan
but
could
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
mr.
estrada?
because
if
justice
alito
is
right,
then
the
new
guidelines
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
in
fact
promulgated
should
not
be
being
applied
right
now
to
those
who
committed
crimes
before
the
enactment
date.
and
that's
not
what's
happening
now
on
the
ground,
is
it?
