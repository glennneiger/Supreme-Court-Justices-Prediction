justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
how
--
how
many
are
we
talking
about?
say,
a
3-month
period?
how
many
people
commit
--
most
people
--
everybody
pleads
guilty,
they
are
caught
quickly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
not
necessarily.
that's
why
i
want
your
estimate
of
how
many
we
are
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
--
how
long
historically,
roughly,
if
you
know,
does
it
take
from
the
time
the
person's
caught
till
the
time
he's
sentenced,
when
he
pleads
guilty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
11
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
many
of
--
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
i'm
trying
to
get
at
a
guess,
if
you
like,
of
how
many
people
we
are
talking
about.
the
two
numbers
that
i
can't
find
in
the
briefs
are
roughly
--
if
your
opponent
is
correct,
and
it
only
applies
to
new
people,
this
thing
--
that's
the
applicable
law
--
in
other
words,
you
are
assuming
the
answer
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
you
are
assuming
the
answer.
i
haven't
heard
an
argument
for
it,
except
that
there
are
very
few
people
that
his
interpretation
or
the
opposite
interpretation
would
catch.
and
how
many
were
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
about?
i
mean,
is
it
more
like
10,
or
is
it
more
like
50,
is
it
more
like
100?
can
you
make
a
guess
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
isn't
it
obviously
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
--
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at?
i
guess--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
but
you
are
saying
it
would
be
absurd
to
think
that
this
section
8
has
to
do
only
with
prior
--
the
pre-enactment
offenses.
absurd,
all
right?
if
there
is
just
likely
to
be
one
person,
i
tend
to
buy
your
absurdity
argument.
if
there
is
likely
to
be
500
or
1,000,
i'm
much
less
certain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
argument
--
of
course,
they
could
have
had
both
in
mind.
they
could
have
had
applicable
law
for
the
new
people
is
our
new
statute;
applicable
for
the
old
people,
you
don't
need
any
amendment,
we're
not
talking
about
that,
just
apply
the
old
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
makes
perfect
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
are
wrong
about
that.
i
mean,
i
think
when
they
--
they
meant
do
it,
not
consider.
does
that
change?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean,
i
think
that
when
they
wrote
this
3553,
they
were
thinking
those
were
the
guidelines
that
are
going
to
apply.
do
it.
now,
i'll
look
into
that.
but
if
i
--
if
i
reach
the
conclusion
i
reach
--
competing
background
briefs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
applicable
law
doesn't
help
us,
because
--
all
the
time,
there
are
two
different
sets
of
guidelines
that
apply
depending
upon
when
you
committed
the
crime.
that's
very
common.
all
right.
so
i
agree
with
you
that
far.
but
now
i'm
worried
about
--
the
last
question
justice
scalia
asked
does,
i
think,
focus
this
question,
because
we
have
not
only
109,
we
have
also
the
--
the
one
we're
talking
about
now,
and
that
says,
normally,
you
will
apply
the
guidelines
in
effect
even
to
people
who
committed
the
crime
before
the
new
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
we
have
any
analogies?
has
this
ever
happened
before?
is
there
--
i
can't
find
out
how
many
people
we're
talking
about.
i'd
like
to
know
at
least
are
there
many
other
occasions
when
congress
amended
mandatory
minimums
so
there's
some
precedence?
any?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait.
this
is
--
just
tell
me
if
maybe
the
light
is
dawning,
and
maybe
i'm
just
at
the
same
question
justice
kagan
asked.
think
of
before
the
statute.
there
were
two
sets
of
people:
those
people
subject
to
the
mandatory
minimum
and
those
crack
people
who
--
the
mandatory
minimum
didn't
matter,
but
the
commission
wrote
amendments
consistent
with.
so
they
were
tough
amendments,
so
the
law
didn't
require
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
produce
consistency.
now
the
statute's
passed.
now
we
have
some
of
the
pre-act
offenders.
because
of
the
two
sets
of
things,
section
8
on
the
one
hand
and
the
3553(g)
on
the
other,
in
respect
to
those
people
who
were
not
governed
by
the
mandatory
minimum
previously
but
were
subject
to
the
then-conforming
amendments,
now
will
have
to
be
subject
to
new
conforming
amendments
that
conform
to
the
new
thing.
and
that
--
because
that'll
have
to
be
because
of
the
combination
of
the
two
sections
that
mr.
dreeben
read,
the
--
all
right.
now,
if
that's
so,
we
get
to
the
cliffs
that
justice
kagan
is
talking
about.
and
if
i'm
right
so
far,
we're
now
back
at
the
probation
officer
example,
and
it's
so
odd
and
so
peculiar
that
it
is
not
just
a
fair
--
do
you
see
where
i'm
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
too
complicated?
[laughter]
i
don't
blame
you,
frankly.
but
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
blame
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
imagine
you
would
find
disagreement
with
that.
you
know
--
you
know
--
you
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
year
that
these
took
effect,
think
of
the
sentences
that
were
not
governed
by
mandatory
for
crack,
not
governed
by
the
mandatory
minimum.
did
the
guidelines
provide,
let's
call
it
a
low
sentence,
disproportionately
low?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
did
they
change
those
non-mandatory
part
when
they
wrote
new
ones?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
look
it
up.
i
will
look
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
really
is
a
more
technical
matter.
congress
has
provided
that
mandatory
minimum
sentences,
typically
five
years
or
10
years
sentences
applicable
to
certain
offenders
who
possess
certain
amounts
of
drugs.
until
august
3rd,
2010,
congress'
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
laws
treated
crack
cocaine
as
far
worst
than
powdered
cocaine,
indeed
a
100
times
worst.
that
is
to
say,
the
same
five-year
mandatory
minimum
would
apply
to
distributing
five
grams
of
crack
as
it
did
to
distributing
500
grams
of
powder.
as
of
august
3rd,
2010,
however,
a
new
more
lenient
mandatory
minimum
law
took
effect.
that
law
treated
crack
as
only
18
times
worst,
not
100
times
worst
than
powder.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
new
law
applies
to
those
who
committed
a
crack
offense
before
the
effective
date
of
the
statute,
namely
august
3,
2010,
but
they
were
not
sentenced
until
after
the
effective
date
of
the
statute,
august
3,
2010.
so
they
committed
it
before,
but
they're
sentenced
after.
does
the
new
more
lenient
statute
apply
or
they
have
to
go
under
the
old
one?
the
issue
is
difficult
because
a
statute
that
congress
passed
in
1871
says
that
we
should
assume
the
old
law
applies
in
the
situation.
to
those
who
committed
a
crime
before
a
new
law's
effective
date,
unless
the
new
law
expressly
provides
that
the
new
law
applies.
they
have
to
do
the
old
one
unless
it
says
expressly
in
the
new
one
that
this
new
more
lenient
one
applies
to
them
and
the
new
mandatory
minimum
law
does
not
expressly
say
it
applies
to
this
pre-enactment
group
of
offenders.
we
nonetheless
conclude
that
the
new
more
lenient
mandatory
minimum
law
does
apply
to
that
group.
why?
well,
for
one
thing
as
all
of
the
court
agrees,
the
word
expressly
here
does
not
mean
that
some
magic
form
of
words
has
to
appear
in
the
new
statute.
the
question
basically
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
it
has
to
be
at
least
clear
whether
it
is
clearly
implied
or
maybe
it
has
to
be
of
the
plain
import
of
the
statute
that
congress
did
intend
to
apply
the
new
more
lenient
law
to
those
who
committed
a
crime.
they
have
not
yet
been
sentenced
as
of
the
date
the
new
law
took
effect.
for
another
thing,
another
statute
makes
clear
that
to
apply
a
new
more
lenient
sentencing
guideline
to
those
who
have
yet
to
be
sentenced
as
of
the
date
of
the
enactment
is
the
norm
in
the
sentencing
world.
language
in
the
new
crack
law
helps
us
along
to
this
same
conclusion.
further,
to
hold
the
contrary.
i.e.,
to
hold
that
congress
intended
the
old
harsher
law
to
apply
to
those
not
yet
sentenced
would
make
sentencing
law
in
this
area
less
uniform
treating
similar
offenders
differently
and
it
would
bring
about
greater
disproportionality
treating
different
offenders
similarly.
indeed,
it
would
make
matters
worst
in
this
respect,
and
they
are
important
respects
underlying
sentencing
than
they
were
before
the
new
law
was
enacted.
finally,
we
can
find
no
convincing
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
these
unfair
consequences.
why
would
it
have
wanted
the
new
law
not
to
apply?
why
it
would
have
wanted
those
results?
we
couldn't
answer
that
question.
so,
we
consequently
conclude
that
congress
clearly
did
intend
the
new
mandatory
minimum
is
to
apply
to
those
who
committed
a
crack
crime
before
august
3,
2010,
were
not
sentenced
until
after
august
3,
2010,
the
date
the
new
law
took
effect.
we
vacate
the
contrary
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit.
we
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
thomas,
and
justice
alito.
