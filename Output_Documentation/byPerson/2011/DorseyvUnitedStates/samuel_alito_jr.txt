what
do--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
there
might
be
a
few,
but
there
--
but
assume
that
you're
drafting
this
legislation
and
you
want
it
to
apply
only
to
defendants
who
commit
an
offense
after
the
enactment
of
the
fair
sentencing
act,
but
you
also
want
to
do
everything
that
you
reasonably
can
to
make
sure
that
when
the
very
first
one
of
those
defendants
comes
up
for
sentencing,
there
will
be
new
sentencing
guidelines
in
effect
that
are
geared
to
the
new
lower
mandatory
minimums
rather
than
the
old
sentencing
guidelines
in
effect.
would
you
not
provide
that
the
--
would
you
not
require
the
sentencing
commission
to
act
as
quickly
as
possible
to
get
the
new
sentencing
guidelines
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
would
say
take
your
time
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
a
few
--
a
few
defendants
who
are
--
who
commit
the
offense
after
the
enactment
of
the
fair
sentencing
act
come
up
and
they
are
--
they're
subjected
to
the
old
soon-to-be-obsolete
sentencing
guidelines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
about
your
argument?
because
i
do
think
the
one
you're
stressing
now
is
a
--
is
a
good
argument
and
your
best
one.
but
what
troubles
me
is
that
an
earlier
bill,
h.r.
265,
which
contained
the
provision
that
says
"there
shall
be
no
retroactive
application
of
any
portion
of
this
act.
"
contains
the
very
language
that
you're
stressing
now.
so
how
do
you
reconcile
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
but
wouldn't
you
want
--
the
problem
that
you're
--
maybe
--
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
the
language
you're
stressing
now
will
mean,
if
this
applies
only
to
post-enactment
offenders,
that
there
will
be
defendants
who
will
be
sentenced
to
--
under
the
--
under
old
--
under
the
old
mandatory
minimums
but
the
new
guidelines.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
that
not
occur
under
the
--
clearly
occur
under
h.r.
265?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
along
those
lines,
could
i
--
could
i
ask
you
this
question,
which
is
intended
to
explore
the
--
the
issue
whether
the
argument
about
bringing
the
guidelines
into
consistency
with
applicable
law
doesn't
assume
the
--
the
answer
that
is
--
that
one
attempts
to
get
from
it.
suppose
the
--
the
--
the
fair
sentencing
act
said
expressly,
this
applies
only
--
the
new
mandatory
minimums
apply
only
to
post-act
offenders,
but
it
also
contained
a
provision
that
says
the
sentencing
commission
has
to
bring
the
guidelines
into
consistency
with
applicable
law.
i
assume
there
what
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
say
that
the
new
guidelines
apply
only
to
post-enactment
offenders,
so
that
the
fair
sentencing
act
would
trump
this
previous
provision
in
the
sentencing
reform
act.
wouldn't
that
be
correct?
