mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
are
unanimous
in
their
belief
that
this
case
raises
a
good
question.
and,
of
course,
that
good
question
is:
why
would
congress
want
district
courts
to
continue
to
impose
sentences
that
were
universally
viewed
as
unfair
and
racially
discriminatory?
my
colleague
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
podium,
i
submit
to
the
court,
does
not
answer
that
question.
petitioners
feel
that
the
answer
to
that
question
can
be
found
in
the
text
of
the
fair
sentencing
act.
and
while
we
admit
that
there
is
no
express
answer,
the
text
gives
us
the
required
fair
implication.
the
text
in
section
8,
the
text
in
section
10--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--no,
it
is
not,
but
the
standard
from
this
court,
justice
scalia,
is
fair
implication,
and
it
has
been
ever
since
great
--
the
great
northern
case.
it
--
these
standards
began
--
i'm
sorry
--
as
a
necessary
implication
in
great
northern,
moved
to
plain
and
clear
implication
in
hertz
and
woodman,
and
then
marrero,
which
is
relied
on
heavily
by
amicus.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
but,
again,
ever
since
1908,
that's
a
standard
that
this
court
has
not
accepted.
and
this
is
based
on
the
provision,
the
well-settled
provision,
that
an
earlier
congress
cannot
bind
a
later
congress.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
the
answer
is
no,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
felt
that
that
was
the
standard.
again
relying
on
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
said
you
give
us
text
and
if
we
are
able
to
find
that
the
fair
implication
and
the
intent
of
congress
through
that
fair
implication
is
that
this
new
statute
applies,
because
an
earlier
congress
cannot
bind
the
newer
congress--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--oh,
absolutely,
the
court
is,
your
honor.
and
we
acknowledge--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--yes,
109
is
relevant,
but
it's
the
standard
to
be
employed
in
determining
whether
or
not
there's
a
fair
implication
of
what
the
later
congress
meant.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
fair
implication
from
marrero--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--correct.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
marcello.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
yes,
your
honor.
you're
correct,
a
clear
or
a
necessary,
but
petitioners
contend
that
not
only
do
we
meet
the
fair
implication
standard--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--marrero
primarily
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
nonretroactivity.
in
an
alternate
holding,
the
court
held
that
109
would
also
be
relevant
to
the
decision.
marrero,
though,
was
a
habeas--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--correct.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
no,
i
believe
it
is
an
alternative
holding,
because
the
primary
holding
in--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
109
was
the
alternative
holding,
saying
that
109
would
also
preclude
the
retroactivity
provision.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
in
marrero,
the
primary
holding
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
nonretroactivity.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
correct.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
well,
in
application,
when
the
court
applied
this
in
marcello,
when
they
were
weighing
the
language
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
opposed
to
the
language
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
i
think
the
court
made
clear,
as
it
went
through
the
statute
there,
that
there
was
a
fair
implication.
and
then
once
you
get
to
the
point
of
fair
implication,
it
necessarily
means
that
there
is
some
kind
of
an
ambiguity.
and
then
the
court
followed
up
saying
that
we
then
did
look
to
the
legislative
history,
and
the
legislative
history
backs
up
the
implication
that
we
did
find.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
directly?
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
we
agree
there
is
no
express
provision,
but
obviously,
we
also
contend
that
going
back
to
the
proposition
that
an
earlier
congress
cannot
bind
the
later,
that
that
standard
has
been
rejected
even
though
argued
by
my
colleague
to
my
left.
that
is
no
longer
the
standard
ever
since--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--when
you
look
at
the
language
of
section
8,
when
congress
has
mandated
the
sentencing
commission
to
use
their
emergency
authority
to
achieve
consistency
with
other
guideline
provisions
and
applicable
law,
it
makes
clear
that
congress
meant
this
needs
to
take
effect
as
soon
as
possible.
congress
even
said
"as
soon
as
practicable
and
no
later
than
90
days.
"
this
would
be
meaningless,
actually,
with
regard
to
the
individuals
who
were
in
this
pipeline
to
be
sentenced,
because
there
would
be
so
few
individuals
who
would
be
arrested,
charged,
convicted,
and
sentenced
within
that
90-day
period
that
congress
could
only--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--no.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
because
of
the--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--no.
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
average
time
from
charging
to
sentencing
is
going
to
be
at
least
11
months.
in
a
case
where
a
defendant
goes
to
trial,
it's
going
to
be
much
more
than
that.
so
there
really
need
be
no
rush
on
the
part
of
congress
to
condense
this
down
into
90
days.
they
could
go
through
their
usual
120-day
--
or
180-day
procedure,
submit
these
to
congress,
wait
for
approval
or
disapproval,
and
things
like
that.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
i
think
we
do,
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
to
know
that
congress
--
congress
knows
that
because
these
are
the
individuals
who
drafted
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
on
just
the
point
of
the
immediacy
placed
on
by
congress,
i
think
that
would
take
away
from
the
fair
implication
that
congress
meant
that
it
--
the
law
should
be
go
--
or
the
law
should
be
effective
on
the
date
of
the
president's
signature.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
the
correct
date
is
the
august
3rd
date,
your
honor,
because
of
the
intent
of
congress
made
known
through
the
implication
of
the
language
taken
in
the
legal
context
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
when
congress
meant
to
correct
their
error,
i
believe
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
meant
to
correct
this
error
as
soon
as
possible.
this
has
been
an
error
that
had
been
discussed
for
25
years
and
was
finally
trying
to
be
corrected.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
obviously
this
court
recognizes
the
difficulty
of
those
district
court
judges
sitting
and
asking
themselves:
what
do
i
do
with
this
defendant
as
opposed
to
another
defendant?
and
after
listening
to
my
colleague,
mr.
estrada,
i
still
have
to
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
question
that
the
court
has
been
asking:
what
possible
reason
could
congress
have
to
want
a
district
court
judge
to
have
to
sit
back
5
years
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
fair
sentencing
act
and
impose
mandatory
minimums
that
everyone
agrees
at
this
point
are
racially
discriminatory?
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
it
can
be,
but,
as
justice
sotomayor
recognizes,
there
has
never
been
a
situation
such
as
this
basically
in
the
history
of
criminal
law
and
criminal
law
sentencing
in
our--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--congress
ultimately
felt
that
they
did,
yes.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
the
guidelines
changed
in
different
respects
with
regard
to
different
amounts.
the
new--
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
--i
suggest
the
court
--
we
admit
that
109
has
to
be
considered
in
the
case,
but
i
think
to
find
what
was
really
meant
by
congress,
after
the
court
looks
to
section
109,
the
court
does
have
to
look
to
the
3553
sentence,
or
3553
section,
that
makes
it
very
plainly
clear,
ever
since
the
sentencing
reform
act,
that
the
date
of
sentencing
clearly
is
the
important
date,
as
opposed
to
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
stephen
e.
eberhardt
but
it
goes
hand-in-hand
with
the
mandate
from
the
sentencing
commission
to
put
the
new
guidelines
in
place
as
soon
as
practical,
as
well
as
provisions
of
section
10.
thank
you
very
much.
