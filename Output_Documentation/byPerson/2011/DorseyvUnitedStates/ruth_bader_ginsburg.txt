it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
right
that
if
you're
right--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that's
true
of
all
of
the
cases
that
you
--
the
cases
--
you
pointed
to
two
or
three
that
use
"fair
implication".
the
court
in
all
those
cases
found
that
there
was
no
fair
implication,
so
that
109
governed.
isn't
--
isn't
that
so?
that
was
true
in
marrero.
it
was
true
in
northern
securities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
none
of
the
cases
that
used
the
fair
implication
language
did
the
court
say:
and,
therefore,
the
old
statute
no
longer
governs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
relying
on
a
standard
that
this
court
did
--
must
have
considered
appropriate
because
it
deviated
from
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
said
it
a
few
times.
but
in
application,
it
always
came
out
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
not
true
of
the
109
cases.
you
don't
have
a
109
case
that
says
the
standard
is
fair
implication,
and,
therefore,
the
old
statute
is
not
enforced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
you
pick
the
date
that
the
fair
sentencing
act
went
into
effect,
if
it
--
if
what
--
if
the
guidelines
are
a
90-day
period,
that
the
commission
came
out
with
its
new
guidelines
on
november
1st,
and
some
time
after
august
3,
which
was
when
the
sentencing
act
--
so
on
--
on
your
theory,
why
isn't
the
right
date
the
date
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
went
into
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
to
draw
a
line
someplace
and
that's
inevitable
that
some
people
are
going
to
fall
on
one
side.
but
the
point
about
the
guidelines
and
statute
working
together,
wasn't
there
a
time
when
the
sentencing
guidelines
--
they
wanted
to
do
away
with
this
distinction
and
congress
said,
no,
sentencing
commission,
you
can't
do
it,
you
can't
do
it
to
the
guidelines
when
we
don't
do
it
to
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
did
say:
sentencing
commission,
you
conform
your
new
guidelines
to
applicable
law.
the
applicable
law
has
got
to
be
the
new
law,
because
if
it
were
the
old
law,
there
is
nothing
to
conform.
there
is
nothing
that
they
need
to
change.
it's
only
that
this
section
(a)(2)
makes
sense
only
if
the
applicable
law
is
the
new
law.
otherwise
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
to
achieve
consistency.
