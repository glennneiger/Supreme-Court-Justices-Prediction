do
you
think
it's
a
clear
and
unmistakable
implication--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
we
are
going
to
argue
about
the
language?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
generally
the
word
"express"
incorporates
"clear".
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
--
why
doesn't
that
defeat
your
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
dreeben,
almost
any
law
that
repeals
a
prior
penalty
is
doing
so
because
the
legislature
determines
that
that
prior
penalty
is
unjust
in
some
way,
because
why
do
you
eliminate
a
penalty
unless
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
and
that
it
is
injust
or
unjust
in
some
way?
so
what
makes
this
repeal
particularly
different
so
that
the
exception
doesn't
swallow
the
rule,
because
you
can
argue
in
almost
any
situation
that
the
repeal
is
of
something
that's
unjust?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
estrada,
what's
so
difficult
for
a
legal
doctrine
to
say
that
when
congress
has
made
a
finding
that
a
law
has
a
discriminatory
impact
--
because
i
always
thought
that
when
discrimination
was
at
issue,
that
we
should
do
as
speedy
a
remedy
as
we
could,
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
tenets
of
our
constitution,
as
has
been
repeatedly
emphasized
in
case
after
case,
that
our
laws
should
be
--
should
be
enforced
in
a
race-neutral
way.
once
congress
has
said
this
law's
not
being
enforced
in
a
race-neutral
way,
we
want
to
fix
it,
why
shouldn't
our
presumption
be
that
the
fix
is
immediate
rather
than
delayed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
estrada,
i've
been
a
judge
for
nearly
20
years,
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
one
law
that
has
created
more
controversy
or
more
discussion
about
its
racial
impact
than
this
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
think
there
is
any
other
law
that
had
as
much
conversation
about
its
racial
implications
than
this
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
this--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
estrada,
even
without
the
guideline
amendment,
for
those
defendants
who
committed
crimes
after
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
they
would
not
have
had
--
new
offense,
not
old
offense
--
if
the
day
after
this
act
they
committed
the
offense,
they
wouldn't
have
had
a
mandatory
minimum
that
required
their
imprisonment
for
a
certain
amount
of
time,
because
the
act
had
already
done
away
with
the
mandatory
minimum,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
changed
the
guide--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--changed
it,
lowered
the
amounts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
so
those
people
would
not
have
been
bound
to
a
mandatory
minimum.
and
since
district
courts
were
not
bound
to
the
guidelines
anyway,
even
if
there
had
been
no
amendment
to
the
guideline,
the
judges
would
have
known
they
weren't
bound
to
the
mandatory
minimum,
and
probably
not
bound
to
guidelines
that
hadn't
been
amended
yet
either.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
would
have
benefited
these
defendants
no
matter
what.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
only
in
cases
like
this,
where
we
know
they
have
to
change
because
congress
has
directed
they
be
changed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
problem
i
started
with,
with
you,
which
is
if
we
know
that
this
new
congress
has
already
determined
that
those
--
that
mandatory
minimum
is
discriminatory
in
the
way
that
it
had
been
constructed,
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
delaying
implementation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
estrada--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
estrada,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
example.
i
think
that
the
guideline
regulation
is
that
the
guideline
--
the
sentencing
commission
always
has
to
be
--
pass
guidelines
consistent
with
the
mandatory
minimum.
and
if
the
statute
says
that
the
mandatory
minimum
requires
the
--
the
carrying
medium
to
be
included,
the
guidelines
can't
change
that.
the
mandatory
minimum
would
apply.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
defendant
--
i
don't
know
that
i
know
of
one
guideline
scheme
that
changes
whatever
congress
has
statutorily
required.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
you
have
to
--
what
you
are
arguing
is
not
that
the
guidelines
would
be
available
for
new
offenses.
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
they
would
be
available
for
everybody
except
the
cliffhangers.
that's
--
that's
what
you're
arguing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
everyone
but
the
cliffhangers,
because,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
those
people
who
were
subject
to
the
old
guideline
at
a
higher
rate
above
the
minimum
now
have
the
benefit
of
a
lower
rate,
and
so
they're
going
to
get
sentenced
to
a
lower
amount
because
they
are
not
bound
by
the
mandatory
minimum.
