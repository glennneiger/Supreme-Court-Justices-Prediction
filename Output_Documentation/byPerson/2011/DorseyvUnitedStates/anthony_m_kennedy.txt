justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
your
statement
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--one
congress
cannot
bind
a
later
congress,
do
you
mean
we're
not
supposed
to
look
at
109?
we're
not
supposed
to
look
at
the
dictionary
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
--
so
then
the
fact
that
109
is
on
the
books
is
relevant.
and
--
and
it's
not
a
question
of
one
congress
binding
the
other.
it's
a
question
of
what
the
second
congress
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
we
--
we
ignore
the
dictionary
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
can
we
ignore
109?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
doesn't
it
--
why
doesn't
that
bring
us
right
back
to
what
109
says?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
government
is
arguing,
and
the
petitioner
is
arguing,
for
a
uniform
rule,
the
rule
that
the
time
of
sentencing
controls.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
uniformity
doesn't
quite
answer
it,
unless
i
misunderstood.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
kagan's
question
concerning
what
interest
is
served
by
your
position
has
--
has
particular
force
when
we're
talking
about
the
sentencing
judge.
the
hardest
thing
--
as
we
know
in
the
judicial
system,
one
of
the
hardest
things
is
sentencing.
and
you're
saying
that
a
sentencing
judge
who
knows
the
law
has
been
changed,
who
knows
the
law
has
been
criticized,
is
nevertheless
bound
and
determined
that
it's
fair
for
this
person
to
be
sentenced
to
the
longer
term.
that's
a
very
difficult--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--position
to
put
the
judge
in.
now,
i
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--go
ahead.
