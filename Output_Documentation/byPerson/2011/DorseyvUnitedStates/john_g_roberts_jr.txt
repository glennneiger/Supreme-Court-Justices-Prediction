chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-5683,
dorsey
v.
united
states,
and
11-5721,
hill
v.
united
states.
mr.
eberhardt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
statute
itself
says
"express",
right?
talking
about
section
109.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we're
pretty
far
removed
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
guess.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
and
i
understand
that.
but
presumably
--
we
also
have
the
proposition
that
congress,
when
it
enacts
legislation,
knows
the
law.
they
would
have
known
section
109
required
an
express
statement
if
they
wanted
to
apply
the
change
retroactively.
so
why
shouldn't
we
hold
them
to
that
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
we
just
supposed
to
assume
that
congress
knows
that?
i
mean,
if
you
had
asked
me
how
long
is
the
usual
time
from
conviction
or
--
i
mean,
arrest
to
conviction,
i
wouldn't
know
if
it's
closer
to
90
days
or
11
months.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right.
but
i
mean
--
and
we
assume
congress
knows
the
law.
i
don't
know
that
we
can
readily
assume
they
know
details
such
as
that
and
evaluate
their
--
what
would
your
position
be
if
the
congress
said
do
this
as
soon
as
practical,
but
in
any
event,
no
later
than
8
months
from
now?
would
we
then
think
there's
a
fair
implication
that
congress
meant
it
to
apply
retroactively
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
--
why
90
days?
i
mean,
the
commission
basically
just
took
the
ratio
under
the
new
act
and
applied
it,
didn't
they,
throughout?
they
took
the
mandatory
minimum
formula
that
had
been
changed
and
changed
it
throughout
the
--
the
sentencing
provisions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead,
justice
sotomayor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
eberhardt,
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
those
arguments
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
provision
about
the
sentencing
commission
is
supposed
to
act
quickly
or
any
of
that,
right?
your
argument
is
what
rational
reason
could
congress
have
had
to
--
given
the
urgency
of
the
problem,
the
seriousness,
why
wouldn't
they
have
wanted
the
provisions
to
apply
as
you
urged
they
should?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
eberhardt.
mr.
estrada,
at
the
invitation
of
the
court,
you
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
as
an
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
you've
ably
discharged
that
responsibility,
for
which
the
court
is
grateful.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
case
11-5683,
dorsey
versus
united
states,
and
the
related
case
11-5721,
hill
verus
united
states.
