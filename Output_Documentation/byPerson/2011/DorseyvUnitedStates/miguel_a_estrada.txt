mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
this
is
a
difficult
case
for
public
policy
but
is
not
a
difficult
case
for
legal
doctrine.
fairness
is
on
both
sides--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--because
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
assume
that
the
passage
of
the
act
reflects
congress's
concession
of
intentional
discrimination.
i
think
it
does
recognize
that
there
were
members
of
congress
that
had
concerns
about
the
disparate
impact
of
the
law.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
absolutely.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
sotomayor,
that
is
absolutely
right.
but
it
is
very
significant
that
for
20
years
we
had
this
argument.
the
sentencing
commission,
as
the
government
points
out,
went
to
congress
again
and
again
and
again
to
say
we
don't
agree
with
this,
this
makes
no
sense.
and
for
20
years,
congress
could
not
bring
itself
to
change
it
because
there
was
no
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
lawmakers
that
the
public
policy
was
that
easy.
and
the
fact
is
you
have
a
whole
assortment
of
bills
that
were
considered
by
congress
in
the
last
several
sessions.
for
people
who
believe
legislative
history
is
significant,
they're
all
very
instructive.
most
of
them
did
a
variant
of
the
same
thing.
most
of
them
have
very
identical
language,
even
some
of
the
language
that's
at
issue
here.
they
had
different
proposals.
there
was
one
for
24:
1,
another
one
--
there
were
many
one
to
one.
it
was
clear
that
congress
couldn't
bring
itself
to
an
agreement
as
to
what
the
right
answer
was.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
let
me
give
three
answers
to
that.
i
think,
you
know,
one
of
the
fundamental
points
here
is
that
a
premise
of
the
law
is
to
treat
like
people
alike.
and
people
who
committed
the
same
offense
on
the
same
date
and
may
have
done
so
with
each
other
we
would
expect
to
get
comparable
punishment
if
they
were
comparable
situated
as
to
criminal
history,
and
the
--
that
the
solution
that's
being
urged
undermines
that
even
though
that
is
exactly
what
section
109
says.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
are
two
points
about
the
guidelines
that
i
think
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
one
is
that
they
are
guidelines,
especially
in
the
world
after
booker,
which
is
the
world
that
confronted
congress
in
2010.
they
are
guides
that
must
be
considered
by
the
judge
to
inform
judicial
discretion.
so
in
the
nature
of
the
guidelines
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
saying
that
we
must
have
new
ones
that
also
implies
a
new
obligation
of
statutory
law
to
people
whose
offense
conduct
occurred
earlier.
the
second
aspect
of
it
is
that
it
has
been
part
of
the
nature
of
a
guidelines
system
for
two
decades
that
it
has
been
consistent
with
the
decision
by
congress
in
some
areas
to
constrain
the
exercise
of
discretion
with
mandatory
minimums.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
multiple
occasions
in
kimbrough,
in
neal,
in
depierre,
any
number
of
cases,
and
the
guidelines
themselves
in
section
5g1
recognize
that
the
mandatory
minimum
may
trump
a
lower
guideline.
so
when
you
have
a
long
history
in
2010
of
rulings
from
this
court
acknowledging,
as
you
said
in
your
opinion
in
kimbrough,
that
this
may
lead
to
cliffs,
et
cetera,
and
you
also
have
a
recognition
by
the
commission
itself
that
they
have
to
integrate
this
reality
of
sentencing
law
into
their
own
guidelines,
there
is
very
little
basis
for
an
inference
that
congress
in
providing
new
guidelines
would
have
contemplated
that
the
effective
date
of
the
law
would
change--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
ginsburg,
i
am
prepared
to
admit
for
purposes
of
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
probably
the
right
answer,
that
congress
intended
that
the
guidelines
had
to
line
up
with
the
penalties
of
the
fsa.
the
question
is
cui
bono:
for
whose
benefit.
and
congress
clearly
contemplated
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
you
outlined
that
the
system
in
the
change
in
the
statute
would
not
do
any
good
for
people
coming
to
be
sentenced
6
months
later
if
they
still
had
higher
guidelines.
but
much
has
been
said
here
today
about
the
90-day
window.
the
90-day
window
is
irrelevant.
the
really
relevant
window
is
the
comparison
of
what
the
new
guidelines
would
have
been
and
when
they
would
have
come
out
absent
the
emergency
authority.
absent
any
emergency
authority,
new
guidelines
would
have
come
out
november
1,
2011,
which
would
have
been
a
good
15
months
after
the
passage
of
the
fsa.
and
even
under
the
government--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--a--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--changed
some
of
them.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
some
of
them
may
drop
from
10
to
5,
for
example,
as
one
of
the
--
as
one
of
the
particulars.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct
on
both
counts.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
correct
on
both
counts,
but
that
--
but
that
i
--
you
know,
it
sort
of
assumes
that
the
guidelines
are
systemically
irrelevant
in
all
cases,
because
after
an
appropriate
analysis--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
look.
i
mean,
one
of
the
interesting
aspects
about
these
cases
is
that
one
of
the
petitioners,
for
example,
got
the
benefit
of
being
sentenced
at
the
time
that
the
post-fsa
guidelines,
the
new
emergency
guidelines,
provided
a
sentencing
range
of
him
of
110
to
137.
that's
--
that's
mr.
hill.
these
are
the
new
guidelines.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
mandatory
minimum
of
10,
which
is
on
the
lower
end
of
that
guideline.
the
only
reason
that
case
is
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
is
because,
even
after
the
new
statute,
the
judge
was
of
a
mind
that
he
wanted
to
use
a
one-to-one
ratio.
and
that's
why
there
is
a
controversy
there.
but
that
highlights,
you
know,
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
and
that
the
court
made
in
kimbrough,
which
is
that
the
mandatory
minimums
tend
to
enforce
a
species
of
uniformity
in
a
world
in
which
the
guidelines
are
advisory,
and
they
do
help
uphold,
you
know,
the
principle
that
people
that
committed
comparable
offenses
will
have
some
lost
comparability.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
if
congress
had
made
that
finding,
justice
sotomayor,
i
would
fully
expect
them
as
a
citizen
to
cut
the
sentences
of
everybody
who
is
already
serving
the
sentence
irrespective
of
finality.
and
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
do
that,
which
is
a
proposition
on
which
everybody
agrees,
i
think
is
powerful
evidence
that
the
assumption
that
this
necessarily
reflects
a
conclusion
that
the
previous
system
was
indisputably
discriminatory
as
opposed
to
arguably
discriminatory--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--right.
this
is
a
fight
about
competing
background
rules.
section
109
is
one
of
them
and
it
says:
the
old
law
shall
be
applied
to
people
who
committed
their
offenses
while
the
old
law
was
in
force.
it
is
a
directly
applicable
statute
to
the
situation
at
hand.
this
purported
competing
background
rule
is
a
rule
that
simply
says
a
judge
shall
consider
the
guidelines
then
extant.
and
this
is
part
of
the
advice
that
he
gets.
it
implies
nothing
about
the
duty
to
apply--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
it
would
be
a
radical
understanding.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
breyer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--okay.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
breyer,
this
is
a
staple
of
what
has
happened
in
the
lower
courts
in
the
routine
application
of
section
109.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
my
best
example
--
and
please
do
not
think
i'm
pandering
--
is
a
case
called
u.s.
v.
smith
from
the
second
circuit,
which
was
authored
by
then-judge
sotomayor.
and
it
was
a
comparable
case
in
which
congress
had
dropped
the
severity
of
a
penalty.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
had
to
be
--
you
know,
the
penalty
that
deals
with
supervised
release.
and
congress
had
gone
from
a
world
in
which
a
violation
of
supervised
release
had
to
be
subject
to
a
mandatory
sentence,
to
a
world
in
which
the
statute
had
been
changed,
to
say
that
it
was
up
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
by
the
time
the
offender
came
to
court,
he
had
violated
his
supervised
release.
and
his
argument,
which
was
actually
a
lot
more
plausible
than
this
one,
was
that
before
he
violated,
the
law
had
changed,
and
he
was
now
in
effect
now
coming
to
the
court
for
a
new
sentencing.
which
is
exactly
analogous
to
this.
the
second
circuit
had
no
trouble
in
saying
that
a
routine
application
of
section
109
killed
that
claim
because
the
offense
was
considered
completed
at
the
time
it
was
committed.
and,
therefore,
this
was
a
--
a
claim
that
simply
was
not
tenable
in
light
of
the
language
of
section
109.
and
that,
too,
is
a
--
is
a
case
where
somebody
could
have
said
the
law
that
now
applies
is
the
one
that
applies
to
my
new
sentencing
under
the
new
applicable
guidelines.
now,
i
will
say
another
two
logical
points
about,
you
know,
the
competing
rule
that
the
government
is
urging.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
do
not.
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
absolutely
right,
and
that
was
the
--
the
paradox,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
--
that
the
government
brought
you
in
kimbrough.
and
the
court
accepted
that
that
was
the
case.
it
said,
yes,
this
leads
to
cliffs.
it
leads
to
a
lack
of
a
straight
line
in
between
all
of
the
possible
penalties.
we
accept
all
of
that.
it
is
an
artifact
of
the
fact
that
congress
at
certain
points,
but
not
on
a
continuous
line,
has
chosen
to
constrain
sentencing
discretion
with
the
rough
tool
of
a
quantity
threshold.
it
is
all
set
out
in
the
kimbrough
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
he
found
inexplicable.
i
think
the
--
you
know,
the
whole
notion
of
changing
it
up
to
a
point
was
more
what
he's
saying.
i
can
think
that
congress
has
at
least
the
rational
reason
that
the
court
ascribed
to
the
system
in
its
post-booker
way
at
the
top
of
page
108,
i
think,
in
the
kimbrough
case,
where
it
is
that
now
that
we
have
a
system
in
which
so
much
depends
on
the
discretion
of
the
individual
sentencer,
it
is
actually
salutary
to
have
a
few
points
of
confluence
that
work
as
an
enforced,
although
rough,
uniformity
in
the
sentences
of
comparably
situated
offenders.
if
i
go
back--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
i
think
that
there
are
competing
visions
of
fairness
and
of
uniformity
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
i
am
trying
to
hold,
you
know,
the
government
to
the
one
they
had
in
the
mcneill
case
last
year,
because
the
identical
argument
was
made
to
them
in
the
--
on
the
other
side,
that
it
was
somewhat
irrational
to
apply
the
better
sentence
to
the
person
1
day
later
versus
the
person
1
day
earlier.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
if
i
could--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if
i
could
take
the
other
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
if
i
could
take,
you
know,
the
other
side
of
that
argument.
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think,
you
know,
the
court
should
accept
that
congress
contemplated
new
guidelines
but
not
necessarily
take
up,
you
know,
the
government's
view
that
this
is
actually
called
for
by
the
very
end
of
that
section,
applicable
law,
is
that
the
government
looks
at
this
as
a
world
in
which
congress
has
now
intervened
and
in
effect
compelled
a
--
a
more
linear
function
of
sentencing.
so
that,
henceforth,
i
guess
the
commission
has
to
conform
to
the
18-to-1
ratio,
and
it
would
no
longer
be
open
to
the
commission,
for
example,
to
do
what
it
did
in
2007,
which
is
we
changed
our
mind;
there's
a
mandatory
minimum
that
constrains
us,
but
in
light
of
the
most
recent
scholarship,
we
think
the
ratio
should
be
16
to
1.
and
--
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
am
reluctant
to
urge
you
to
accept,
you
know,
the
government's
construction,
which
i
can
see
how
they
would
be
helped
by
in
future
cases,
is
that
i
think
it's
very
implausible
for
congress
to
have
considered
this,
as
they
say,
the
centerpiece
of
the
statute
and
have
--
have
it
be
the
last
depending
clause
of
section
8.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
frankly,
no.
but--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
let
me
--
let
me
say
two
things--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--you
know,
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
simple
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
whole
thing
that
the
guideline
system
now
has
to
conform
with
applicable
law,
which,
you
know,
the
government
reads
as
the
new
ratio
and
could
extend
to
other
things,
could
potentially
disable
the
commission
from
adopting
its
own
ameliorating
amendments
that
depart
from
the
regime
of
--
of
the
mandatory
minimums.
and
so
whereas
there
are
mandatory
minima
that
are
troublesome
and
give
rise
to
cliffs,
there
are
also
occasions
in
which
the
commission
is
able
to
do
things
that
are
not
consistent
with
the
statute.
let
me
give
one
example
that
was
mentioned
by
the
court
in
depierre.
as
the
statute
was
interpreted
in
depierre,
cocaine
base
is
cocaine
base;
it
gets
you
a
mandatory
minimum
if
it's
chemically
based.
the
commission
thinks
that
you
only
get
the
enhanced
penalties
if
the
cocaine
base
happens
to
be
crack.
similarly
under
the
neal
case,
you
get
to
weigh
the
carrier
medium
for
the
lsd,
but,
you
know,
the
commission
thinks
that
you
give
it
a
presumed
weight
that
is
probably
lower
than
the
actual
medium.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
commission
comes
up
with
guidelines
that
are
lower
than
the
methodology
that
is
contemplated
under
the
statutory
analysis.
were
you
to
adopt
the
applicable
law
on
the
assumption
that
the
congress
has
now
dictated
that
these
things
have
to
line
up
and
never
to
have
cliffs
again
because
they
are
bad,
you
could
end
up
having
untoward
consequences
as
to
what
it
is
that
the
commission
can
do
in
the
future
in
order
to
deal
with
other
inequalities--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--for
--
for
purposes
of
the
mandatory
minimum,
but
not
for
the
sentences
in
between.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
just
gave
you
two
examples:
the
lsd
guideline
that
was
at
issue
in
neal
and
the
crack
guideline
that
was
not
at
issue,
but
was
discussed
in
connection
with
the
statutory
interpretation
in
--
in
depierre.
you
know,
my
point
--
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
point.
my
point
is
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
the
new
guidelines
to
be
available
for
new
offenses.
the
fact
that
congress
gave
emergency
authority
so
that
that
would
be
possible
makes
perfect
sense
because
in
the
absence
of
emergency
authority,
the
new
guidelines
would--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--except
for?
i'm
sorry?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
there
are
--
there
are
two
alternative
worlds
under
the
fsa,
justice
sotomayor.
in
the
first
one
guidelines
don't
change
for
15
months.
people
who
committed
the
crime
after
the
fsa
come
to
the
court
for
sentencing
10
months
later
and
they
get
the
new
mandatory
minimum,
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
the
old
guidelines
are
higher.
it
is
possible
that
the
judge
would
intervene
and
use
booker
discretion,
but
not
necessarily
so.
and
the
alternative
world
which
congress
did
give
us
is
you
change
the
guidelines
as
soon
as
you
can;
if
you
come
to
the
bar
of
the
court
with
a
pre-fsa
offense,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
the
new
guidelines,
like
every
guidelines
book
since
the
beginning,
say
that
if
a
mandatory
minimum
applies,
that
controls
over
the
then-current
guidelines,
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
reasons
why
the
alternative
view
of
the
world
and
the
alternative
rule
of
construction
the
government
proffers
makes
no
sense.
as
a
prosecutory
construction
matter
and
for
those
members
in
the
court
who
give
weight
to
legislative
history,
i
will
point
out
that
the
emergency
authority
section
that
the
government
thinks
is
dispositive
on
this
point
was
in
every
version
of
this
bill
--
senate
1711,
senate
1383,
you
know,
the
house
versions
that
they
cite
--
even
when
those
statutes,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
--
i'm
sorry
--
as
justice
alito
pointed
out
earlier,
provided
an
effective
date
for
the
new
statute
of
6
months
hence.
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--correct.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
true
here
as
well.
and
the
reason
why
i
was
highlighting
the
earlier
bills
is
because
each
and
every
one
of
them
had
the
same,
almost
word
for
word,
"conform
with
applicable
law"
emergency
authority.
all
of
them
uniformly
said
the
new
mandatory
minimums
will
not
apply
for
another
6
months
after
the
enactment.
as
a
logical
proposition,
if
congress
thought
that
the
identical
language
made
sense
to
bring
the
guidelines
into
conformity
with
a
law
that
would
not
take
into
--
that
would
not
kick
in
for
another
6
months,
having
it
kick
in
sooner
does
not
have
any
more
logical
import
in
saying
that
therefore,
you
know,
the
guidelines
now
mean
that
previous
offenses
get
a
different
sentence.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
kagan,
it
is
not
happening
in
that
manner,
because
the
guidelines,
every
book
of
the
guidelines,
i
believe
since
1987,
which
is
the
first
one,
has
had,
like,
5g1.1,
which
says
these
are
the
guidelines,
but
5g
tells
you
if
a
mandatory
minimum
applies,
for
whatever
reason,
you
apply
that
and
that
becomes
the
mandatory
sentence.
and
so
there
has
never
been
any
reason
to
have
two
sets
of
guidelines
to
account
for
cliffs
or
andatory
minimums,
because
every
guidelines
book
has
had
a
built-in
solution
to
that
problem,
which
is
we
understand
that
there
are
cliffs,
we
understand
that
there
is
a
world
of
mandatory
minimums;
we
can't
fix
those,
this
is
our
guideline
sentence.
if
somehow,
for
some
reason
--
because
it
occurred,
you
know,
before
or
whatever
--
there
is
a
mandatory
minimum
that
applies,
the
guidelines
say
the
mandatory
minimum
becomes
the
guideline
sentence.
so
in
that
sense,
a
congress
that
knew
the
law
would
understand
that
saying
you
have
to
have
new
guidelines
had
no
logical
force
in
saying
that
therefore
the
effective
date
of
mandatory
minimums
or
any
other
factor
that
bore
on
the
application
of
mandatory
minimums
would
be
changed.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
