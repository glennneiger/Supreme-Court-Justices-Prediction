mr.
panner,
i
thought--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
panner,
suppose
there
were
a
contract
between
ms.
edwards
and
tower
and
the
contract
had
a
no-kickback
clause,
not
one
that
suggested
that
ms.
edwards
had
to
show
any
kind
of
injury,
greater
cost
or
lesser
service,
but
just
you
can't
have
any
kickbacks.
can
she
sue
on
that
contract?
justice
elena
kagan
and
now
suppose
that
congress
passes
a
law
and
says
every
contract
of
this
kind
has
to
have
such
a
provision
in
it.
justice
elena
kagan
would
she
now
have
standing?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
panner,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
questions
and
my
questions,
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
a
difference
depending
on
what
the
source
of
the
law
is.
if
the
source
of
the
right
is
a
contract,
there
is
one
result.
if
the
source
of
the
right
is
a
statute,
there
is
another
result.
and
i
thought
that
that
was
very
much
--
that
is
--
that's
very
much
inconsistent
with
our
case
law,
and
specifically
with
lujan.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
right
understanding
of
her
complaint.
she
is
saying:
i
don't
have
to
prove
those
things
because
there's
been
a
judgment
made
that
these
kinds
of
practices
tend
to
decrease
service
and
tend
to
increase
price
and
therefore
i
don't
have
to
prove
those
matters.
and
that's
the
exact
same
judgment
that
is
made
in
the
trust
cases,
for
example.
justice
elena
kagan
counsel,
i'm
still
having
problems.
