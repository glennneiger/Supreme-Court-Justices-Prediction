mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
an
individual
has
a
statutory
right
to
a
kickback-free
referral
in
a
financial
transaction,
she
participates
in
a
particular
financial
transaction
in
which
her
right
is
violated
and
she
pays
money
for
the
service
unlawfully
referred,
she
has
sustained
an
article
iii
injury
in
fact
based
on,
as
this
court
in
its
repeatedly
explained
test,
an
invasion
of
a
legally
protected
interest.
that
is--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
this
court
has
explained,
i
think
principally
in
your
opinion
in
lujan
v.
defenders
of
wildlife,
that
congress
cannot
convert
an
undifferentiated
public
interest
in
enforcement
of
the
law--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
understand.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
is
also
a
threshold.
obviously,
congress
can't
simply
narrow
the
class
of
--
of
plaintiffs
to
say
people
with
college
degrees,
or
people
who
were
born
on
a
monday.
there
needs
to
be
a
sufficient
connection
between
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--would
you
--
would
you--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we'll
use
"connection"
here.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
we'll
say
"connection".
but
what
--
in
our
view,
there
needs
to
be
a
reasonable
connection
between
the
proscribed
conduct:
here,
the
paying
of
taxes,
and
the
class
of
persons--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--to
which
the
congress
has
conferred
the
right,
and
that
has
to
be
such
that
the
first
class
is
reasonably
regarded
as
victims
of
the
conduct.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it's
unclear.
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
figure
out
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit
further.
if
congress
--
for
instance,
if
the
machine
part
was
a
safety
harness
in
your
car
and
you
purchased
a
car
with
a
safety
harness
but
you
happen
simply,
you
know,
to
not
use
the
safety
harness,
congress
might
well
be
able
to,
say
--
provide
for
a
protection
for
all
purchasers
of
this
particular
vehicle
or
any
kind
of
vehicle,
must
--
those
types
of
vehicles
must
have
that
safety
equipment
in
order
to
protect
the
consumers
who
purchase
it.
and
in
that
instance,
congress
could
well
provide
for
a
statutory
damage
provision
to
protect
such
an
individual
generally.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
correct.
and
let
me
--
let
me
throw
out
some
historical
analogues
to
explain
why
the
focus
has
to
be
on
the
invasion
of
the
legally
protected
interest.
you
have
things
like
trespass.
at
common
law
--
and
this
was
well
known
to
the
framers
--
at
common
law,
if
you
simply
step
across
a
boundary
line,
a
line
defined
in
law
and
the
rights
that
are
defined
in
law
that
are
associated
with
that
line,
if
you
simply
step
across
this
and
step
back,
that
is
a
trespass.
you
can
bring
an
action
in
court,
and
you
could
have
no
--
no
impact
whatsoever
except
the
invasion
of
your
legal
right,
and
you
would
get
nominal
damages.
and
that
type
--
similarly,
if
you
have
a
contract,
you
could
have
a
breach
of
the
contract.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
think
it's
more
than
prudential
standing.
it
goes
to
what
is
an
injury
in
fact,
which
the
court
has
again
repeatedly
explained
is
an
invasion
of
a
legally
protected
interest
that
is
sufficiently
concrete
and
particularized.
no,
we
don't
think
that
congress
can,
through
the
guise
of
a
right,
convert
a
generalized
interest
in
enforcement
of
the
law
into
something
that
an
individual
can
come
into--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
your
cases
actually
say
an
injury
in
fact.
and
then
you
go
on
to
explain.
for
instance,
in
defenders
of
wildlife,
that
that
is
invasion
of
a
legally
protected
interest.
i'm
not
saying
it's
any
invasion
of
a
law,
but
when
congress
confers
a
right--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that's
right.
it
can't
be
an
abstract
type
of
a
thing;
it
has
to
be
in
a
specific
factual
context
that
is
amenable
to
judicial
--
a
realistic
judicial
appreciation
of
the
consequences--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
--
i
don't
know
if
you
could
have
left
it
out.
you
could
have
called
it
anything.
it
is
a
legal
label
that
the
court
has
applied
to--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
an
injury
in
fact
is
not
simply
a
legal
injury
in
the
sense
of
any
violation
of
the
law,
it
is
an
invasion
of
a
legally
protected
interest
with
respect
to
this
particular
individual,
the
particular
plaintiff.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no,
no,
no,
no.
it
includes
several
concepts.
an
injury
in
fact
is
an
invasion
of
a
legally
protected
interest.
it
either
has
to
be
actual
or
imminent,
and
it
has
to
be
concrete
and
particularized.
now,
again,
so
there's
several
concepts
within
the
umbrella
of
injury
in
fact.
but
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
examples
that
we
would
find
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
of
many
types
of
injuries,
where
you
don't
have
to
have
anything
other
than
an
invasion
of
your
legally
protected
right.
for
instance,
a
right
to
an
agreement.
if
there
is
a
breach
that
has
no
impact
whatsoever,
you
would
be
able
to
get
in
and
sue.
now,
there
is
a
question
of
the
quantification
of
damage,
but
that's
separate.
that's
not
whether
you
have
an
injury
in
fact,
it
is
how
--
it's
the
measure
of
damages,
and
the
measure
of
damages
in
common
law
would
be
nominal
damages.
similarly,
an
invasion
--
a
trespass
invasion,
or,
for
instance,
if
you
were
a
beneficiary
of
a--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--and
why
you
have
that
is--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--but
if
the
right's
threatened--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
going
back
to
your
hypothetical,
the
reason
you
have
that
interest,
the
reason
you
have
the
right
to
exclude
this
space
is
solely
by
operation
of
the
law.
those
concepts,
they
are
attached
to
property
rights,
were
created
by
common
law
courts.
just
as
common
law
courts
can
create
rights,
the
invasion
of
which
create
interest,
so
too
can
a
state
legislature
or
when
congress
is
acting
within
its
article
iii
power
to
the
one
power--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
--
any
common
law
court
has
inquired
whether
the
invasion
of
--
the
trespass
somehow
made
you
insecure--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
anything
can
be
monetized.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
it
is
--
it's
kind
of
a
statement,
although
you
know
in
this
--
this
is
specific
transaction,
this
is
a
transaction
involving
the
plaintiff.
she
paid
money
for
a
service
that
she
got,
and
it
was
unlawfully
tainted
by
a
kickback
and
that's
the
type
of
thing
that
traditionally
can
be
enforced
in
court.
