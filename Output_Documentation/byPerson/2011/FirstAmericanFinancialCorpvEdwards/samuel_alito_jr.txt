justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
to
clarify
something?
what
could
a
plaintiff
who
purchases
title
insurance
in
ohio
allege
that
would
be
sufficient
to
provide
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
what
could
be
done
--
okay.
go
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
could
--
the
plaintiff
could
allege
some
kind
defective
service
at
the
time
when
the
title
insurance
was
purchased?
there
really
is
no
service
provided
at
that
time,
is
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
get
a
title
insurance
policy
and
that's
it;
and
you
don't
know
whether
--
you
don't
know
what
will
happen
if
there
is
some
problem
alleged
with
the
title
at
some
point
down
the
road.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
plaintiff
went
further
and
alleged
some
harm
particular
to
her,
wouldn't
that
be
even
more
speculative,
some
economic
harm
particular
to
her?
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
this
is
where
i
have
problems
with
your
argument,
because
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
fiduciary
relationship
and
i
don't
see
where
the
duty
of
loyalty
comes
from.
and
to
say
that
congress
can
just
impose
some
attributes
of
a
fiduciary
relationship
wherever
it
wants
seems
rather
strange.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
i
take
my
car
to
an
auto
dealer
to
have
--
because
it's
making
a
strange
sound.
and
i
say:
call
me
up
when
you
figure
out
what
you
think
is
the
problem.
and
they
call
me
up
and
they
say:
well,
there
are
certain
things
wrong
with
it,
and
it's
going
to
cost
you
$1,000.
and
i
say:
okay,
now,
thanks
for
diagnosing
the
problem;
where
should
i
have
it
fixed?
should
i
have
it
fixed
at
your
shop
or
should
i
go
to
another
place
and
have
it
fixed?
and
they
say:
well,
have
it
fixed
at
our
shop.
now,
is
there
a
breach
of
a
duty
of
loyalty
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know.
but
we
are
looking
for
whether
there
is
an
injury
in
fact.
put
aside
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
breach
of
the
duty
in
law.
there
is
allegedly
here.
i
just
don't
see
where
there
is
an
injury
in
fact,
because
i
know
--
i'm
an
idiot
if
i
don't
realize
--
that
they
have
a
strong
economic
incentive
to
say:
come
have
it
fixed
at
my
place.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
there
be
injury-in-fact
if
the
plaintiff
knew
everything
that
was
relevant
to
this
had
--
had
--
was
an
economist
who
had
studied
the
effect
of
these
things
on
title
insurance
price
and
quality,
and
in
fact,
had
--
was
aware
of
every
single
transaction
that
had
ever
occurred
between
the
title
insurance
company
and
the
title
agent?
would
there
be
injury,
in
fact,
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
nevertheless
said,
okay,
i
understand
this
is
what
i'm
getting
into,
but
i'm
going
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
would
be
injury,
in
fact?
