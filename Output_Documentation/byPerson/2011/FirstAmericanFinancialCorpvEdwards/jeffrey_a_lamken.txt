mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
at
least
280
years
the
law
has
been
clear
that
when
someone
breaches
a
duty
of
loyalty
owed
to
you
by
taking
a
kickback
or
otherwise
introducing
a
conflict
into
a
transaction,
you
can
sue
on
the
basis
of
that
alone,
without
showing
a
further
harm
in
terms
of
economic
loss.
the
invasion
of
your
right
to
conflict-free
service
was
itself
a
sufficiently
concrete
and
particularized
injury
in
fact,
not
an
abstract
and
undifferentiated--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--congress
could
have
made
them,
the
agent,
could
have,
as
you
pointed
out,
could
have
made
them
a
full-fledged
fiduciary.
elevating
your
interest
in
having
no
conflicts
whatsoever
in
the
transaction
to
establish--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--congress
actually
elevated
one
component
of
that
by
giving
you
a
right
to
--
freedom
from
a
particular
conflict
of
interest,
and
that
is
the
kickbacks
that
undermine
their
incentive
to
serve
your
best
interest,
that
undermine
their
incentive
to
choose
the
insurer
that
provides
the
best
quality
and
the
best
service.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
you
might
have
an
interest
in
getting
an
honest
opinion.
it's
just
not
protected
by
law.
they
are
allowed
to
tell
you
what
they
want
to
tell
you
because
you
have
no
protected
interest
in
their
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
congress
is
entitled
to
elevate
your
interest
in
obtaining
honest
judgments
or
conflict-free
advice
to
legal
protection.
whether
you
would
be
an
idiot
in
accepting
it
or
expecting
it
in
the
first
instance,
they
can
take
that
relationship
and
make
it
confidential
and
make
it
an
honest
one,
even
if
you
hadn't
expected
that
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
but
the
common
law
was
absolutely
clear
that
when
someone
invaded
your
right
to
a
conflict-free
transaction,
invaded
your
right
not
to
have
kickbacks
in
your
transactions,
you
didn't
have
to
prove
that
there
was
an
economic
consequence.
the
invasion
of
your
right
not
to
have
conflicts
invade
that
transaction
was
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
they
are
acting--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
that
is
an
agency
duty,
and
we
assume
that
that's
an
agent;
they
are
acting
as
agent
for
the
person
with
the
broken
car
--
the
answer
is
absolutely,
without
having
to
show
any
loss.
and
this
court's
case
in
magruder
v.
drury
was
that
type
of
case,
where
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
have
paid
a
cent
more,
the
estate
would
not
have
paid
a
cent
more
if
that
--
if
they
had
gone
elsewhere
to
make
the
purchase.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
exactly
why
i
said--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--congress
imposed
one
component
of
the
duty
that
applies
to
agents
and
fiduciaries
across
the
board
and
that
is:
don't
take
kickbacks
that
undermine
the
incentive
to
obtain
the
best
deal
offered
a
consumer.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
the
law
has
a
number
of
contexts
where
you
don't
have
to
show
financial
losses.
if
somebody
defames
you,
you
don't
have
to
--
in
your
business,
you
don't
have
to
show
that
you
are
financially
injured.
that's
injury
in
fact
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
our
argument
is
that
the
invasion
of
your
statutory
right
to
a
conflict-free
service
is
itself
an
injury
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--but
it
also
has--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
injury
in
fact
in
the
following
two
senses,
judge
--
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
all
you
have
to
do
--
getting
a
conflict-free
referral
is
itself
substantively
more
valuable
than
getting
one
laden
by
conflict.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think
the
answer
is
so
long
as
congress
has
entitled
you
to
something
of
potential
value
that
isn't
being
denied
to
every
other
member
of
the
public
in
an
undifferentiated
way,
that
is
sufficient
to
be
injury
in
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
potential
value.
and
it's
more
valuable--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
this
sense,
your
honor.
all
you
received
is
substantively
less
valuable.
what
you
have
to
do
is
ask
yourself:
would
i
value
more
advice
from
somebody
who
is
playing
it
straight
on
the
financial
side
or
someone
who
is
taking
kickbacks
from
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
is
injury
in
fact,
and
there
is
another
way
in
which
it's
injury
in
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
she
proved
that
she
got
something
less
valuable.
she
got
something
she
was
entitled
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that
is
actually
quite
incorrect,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
the
injury
in
fact
is
getting
something
that
is
potentially
--
not
getting
something
to
which
the
law
entitles
you,
which
has
potential
value
to
you.
and
a
conflict-free
referral
is
much
more
valuable
than
one
laden
by
conflict.
and
there
is
another
thing.
we
haven't
disclaimed
the
notion
entirely.
we
haven't
--
in
fact
we
believe
it
is
very
likely
that
--
that
quality
or
price
suffered
as
a
result
of
these
--
of
these
conflicts.
but--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
it
is
not,
it's
not
conjectural
at
all.
congress
specifically
found
that
these
are
the
consequences.
but
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
well,
your
honor,
it
is
very
hard
to
prove.
and
it
was
for
that
exact
reason
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
why
the
common
law
elevated
the
right
to
conflict-free
services
from
not
being
legally
protected
to
legal
protection,
because
it
was
so
hard
to
figure
out,
for
the
judge--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
breyer,
the
breach
of
contract,
in
some
sense,
is
precisely
that
pariah.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
a
breach
of
contract.
if
somebody
breaches
--
a
contractual
duty
owed
to
me,
i
don't
have
to
prove
that
i
suffered
economic
injury.
the
breach
of
the
promise
itself
gives
me
a
grievance
sufficient
to
entitle
me
to
sue
for
nominal
damages
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
would
like
$1
more,
your
your
honor.
i
want
nominal
damages
or--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--or
--
or
--
so,
if
there
are
stipulated
liquidated
damages,
you
are
entitled
to
those
as
well.
that
is
the
common
law
rule
for
years--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--so
that
is
--
that
is
precisely
the
context.
but
if
i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
in
--
i
think
that
that
is--
[laughter]
we
are
hoping
to
do
better,
your
honor.
but
that
actually
illustrates--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
if
the
injury
is
sufficient
to
get
you
in
court
to
get
$1--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
doesn't
evaporate
just
because
you
want
to
get--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--exactly,
your
honor.
we
are
seeking
precisely
what
the
statute
and
title
does
when
there
is
the
breach
of
this
duty
owed
to
us--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--for
our
protection.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
one
injury
not
to,
one
injury-in-fact,
a
violation
of
a
duty
owed
to
us
for
our
protection,
not
an
additional
injury
in
the
form
of
having
suffered
an
economic
loss.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
ms.
edwards
would
want
to
get
out
of
the
deal
or
not.
but
the
statute
says
that
she
doesn't
have
to
give
up
her
insurance
which
protects
her
home
in
order
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
--
that
congress
guaranteed
her
which
were--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i
think
this
--
i
think
this
brings
me
back
to
the
question
you
were
asking
me
before,
which
is
indeed,
we
think
it's
like
that
there
is
--
that
there
are
diminution
in
quality
and
paying
excessive
price,
but
the
law
says
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
because
the
law's
elevated
our
right
to
a
conflict-free
transaction
to
legally
protect
its
status.
the
very
reason
the
common
law
said
in
the
fiduciary
and
the
trust
and
all
the
other
confidential
issues
in
context
said
we
are
not
going
to
ask
about
the
economics,
we
are
not
going
to
regulate
the
economics
here,
because
that's
too
hard.
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
we
are
going
to
protect
your
right
to
receive
the
best
advice
possible.
and
at
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it's
not
a
disclosure
duty
but
on
the
statutory
basis
that
she
was
entitled
to
a
conflict-free
referral.
that
they
were
not
directing
her
purchase
on
the
basis
of
complex
that
is
so--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
like
an
aggrieved
trust
beneficiary,
she
is
seeking
to
get
back
something
that
belonged
to
her,
$455
that
she
parted
company
with
in
a
conflicted
transaction.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor,
because
ohio
does
not
preclude
price
competition.
you
can
file
for--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--she
has
been
exposed
--
it's
impossible
to
tell
whether
or
not
fidelity
would
have
been
better
because
of
financial
settlements
or
another
company
would
have
been
better
because
it
has
better
clean
paneling
down
the
road.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
absolutely
not.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
reason
we're
not
--
we
did
not
allege
it
is
because
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
and
for
280
years
when
somebody
takes
a
--
takes
a
kickback
that
interferes
with
your
obtaining
the
best
deal
possible,
that
itself
was
actionable
without
proving
any
further--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it's
not
philosophical
at
all
because
that
exact
right,
ensuring
that
she
gets
her
--
her
purchase
in
a
kickback-free
transaction
is
for
her
benefit.
and
when
she
is
denied
that
right,
she
has
been
denied
something
of
potential
value
that
hasn't
been
denied
to
everybody
else
in
the
universe.
for
her
protection,
she
was
entitled
to
have
them
--
the
very
fact
of
the
kickback
undermines
the
incentive
to
pursue
her
best
interest.
like
a
trust
beneficiary,
a
home
buyer
spending
her
money
to
insure
title
on
her
home
as
a
concrete
and
particularized
interest
in
insuring
that
those
who
direct
the
purchase
are
not
doing
it
based
on
kickbacks,
which
is
so
undermining
--
incentive
to
seek
her
best
interest.
it
may
be
very
hard
to
prove
in
individual
cases
that,
you
know,
fidelity
is
more
financially
sound
or
another
has
better
claims
handling.
but
it
was
precisely
for
that
reason
that
congress
got
out
of
the
business
and
courts
got
out
of
the
business
of
trying
to
regulate
the
underlying
economics.
they
are
not
going
to
regulate
price.
they
are
not
going
to
regulate
quality.
and
instead,
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
right
to
get
the
referral
from
somebody
who
has
expertise
and
who
doesn't
have
a
conflict
created
by
a
conflict
--
by
a
kickback
that
so
undermines
their
incentive--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--justice
scalia,
the
constitution,
statutes,
the
common
law
regularly
create
bright
line
across
the
board
rights
to
protect
underlying
financial
or
other
economic
interests.
where
the
right
may
sweep
more
broadly
or
may
apply
in
cases
where
those
underlying
inputs
are
defected.
but
we
don't
go
look
backwards
at
the
purpose
of
the
right,
abstract
the
right
to
its
purpose
and
say,
well,
unless
it's
purpose
was
--
was
achieved
in
this
particular
purpose,
we're
not
going
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes.
there's
--
there's
injury--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
because
he
has
been
denied
something
he
is
entitled
to,
which
is
another
expert's
untainted
referral,
which
is
not
affected
by
any
way
by
kickbacks,
which
we
know
is
entirely
corrosive
in
interest
to
pursue
his
best
interest.
you
might--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
but
the
--
the
invasion
of
a
statutory
right
itself
can
be
injury
in
fact
so
long
as
it
is
sufficiently
concrete
and
--
and
particularized.
that
you
are
not
just
asserting
another
--
an
interest
of
the
public
at
large.
the
court
has
protected
interests
as
divorced
from
property
interest,
as
the
right
to
obtain
information
from
the
government
through
foia
or
faca,
and
it
can
protect
your
--
your
non-property
interest
in
not
being
defamed.
all
of
these
things
are
protected.
your
rights
to
performance
under
contract.
all
of
these
things
are
protected
whether
or
not
there
is
further
economic
harm
that
results.
and
the
no
further
inquiry
world
that
is
applied
in
the
trust
and
fiduciary
contracts
sphere
is
just
another
example
where
the
law
elevates
your
interest
in
not
having
conflict--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--further,
comma,
economic
harm.
further
harm
of
the
economic
sort,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
exactly.
but
i
view
it
to
be
further
harm,
much
less
further
economic
harm.
thank
you,
your
honor.
