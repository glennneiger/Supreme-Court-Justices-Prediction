chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-708,
first
american
financial
corporation
v.
edwards.

sorry.
justice
ginsburg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
panner.
mr.
lamken.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
gets
to
a
point
that
i
am
having
trouble
getting
my
arms
around.
it
seems
to
me
what
your
position
is,
what
you
want
us
to
focus
on,
there
are
three
possible
arguments.
one
is
that
there
is
injury
in
fact
in
this
case.
i
see
some
of
that
argument
in
your
briefs.
two,
that
congress
presumes
injury
in
fact.
injury
in
fact
is
still
required,
but
that
is
presumed.
i
read
that
to
be
perhaps
what
the
trust
cases
say.
or
three,
that
injury
in
fact
is
not
required
at
all.
now,
which
are
you
arguing?
one,
two
or
three?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
statutory
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i?
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
want
to
pause
on
that
question.
you
said
violation
of
a
statute
is
injury
in
fact.
i
would
have
thought
that
would
be
called
injury
in
law.
and
when
we
say,
as
all
our
standing
cases
have,
is
that
what
is
required
is
injury
in
fact,
i
understand
that
to
be
in
contradistinction
to
injury
in
law.
and
when
you
tell
me
all
that
you've
got
or
all
that
you
want
to
plead
is
violation
of
the
statute,
that
doesn't
sound
like
injury
in
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
now,
that
goes
back
to
the
first
proposition.
that
is
an
argument
that
there
is
injury
in
fact
here.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
--
i
don't
mean
this
in
a
pejorative
sense,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
slide
back
and
forth
between
one,
two,
and
three,
which
makes
it
hard
for
us
to
get
a
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
potential
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
we
said
in
the
whitmore
case,
and
this
is
a
quote:
"allegations
of
possible
future
injury
do
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
article
iii.
"
potential
value
sounds
to
me
like
possible
future
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
is
injury
in
fact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
tell
me
what
this
case
is
about
is
whether
or
not
you've
shown
injury
in
fact,
it's
not
a
significant
--
significant
case,
and
your
client
has
to
prove
that
at
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
--
and
maybe
it's
a
unique
circumstance
in
this
case,
but
ohio
says
this
is
going
to
cost
you
the
same
no
matter
what
you
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
but
then
again,
that's
an
argument
about
was
there
or
was
there
not
injury
in
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
sounds,
again
to
use
a
word
that
we
have
said
is
inadequate
to
support
standing,
that
sounds
conjectural.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
we
are
talking
about
not
what
congress
found;
but
what
the
injury
in
fact
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
will
agree,
won't
you,
that
the
idea
that
it's
certainly
possible
or
whatever
your
formulation
was,
that
the
quality
here
wasn't
good
enough
or
that
the
entire
quality
across
the
board
might
be
better,
that's
conjectural,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
we
in
point
--
now
we
are
at
level
two:
it's
hard
to
prove.
so
is
that
your
argument,
that
congress
presumed
injury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
accept
$1
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
that
--
that
gets
--
i
didn't
mean
to
be
facetious,
but
it
gets
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
have
to
actually
show
injury-in-fact.
your
allegation
in
this
case
is
for
damages,
not
just
nominal
damages
but
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
deal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
see
--
i
didn't
see
an
allegation
for
a
decision
or
--
or
--
so
you
are
perfectly
happy
as
far
as
we
know
from
the
complaint
with
this
deal,
you
just
want
the
extra
$500
per
class
member
without
showing
any
injury--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
--
you
don't
want
the
conflict-free
transaction
because
you
don't
want
to
get
out
of
this
contract.
you
are
perfectly
happy
with
the
contract.
you
want
$500.
you
don't
want
a
conflict-free
transaction
because
even
if
it
was
a
--
were
a
conflict-free
transaction,
the
price
would
be
the
same,
in
ohio.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
now
there
the
answer
to
my
question,
and
i
don't
mean
to
focus
on
a
peculiar
structure
but
your
answer
was
on
part
1.
you
said
no,
not
necessarily.
here
there
was
an
injury-in-fact,
she
might
have
gotten
a
better
deal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you,
just
to
follow
up.
you
said
whether
or
not
there
is
further
economic
harm.
so
you
say
economic
harm
is
required--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
there
can't
be
further
economic
harm
if
there
isn't
economic
harm
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
further
harm
that
happens
to
be
economic,
not
further
economic
harm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
yang?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
--
why
do
we
always
say
injury
in
fact
then?
you
say
so
long
as
the
harm
is
a
violation
of
the
law
in
legally
protected
interest.
our
standing
cases
always
say
injury
in
fact
as
opposed
to
injury
in
law.
and
you
are
saying
if
you
violate
the
law,
you
have
sufficient
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
--
they
also
go
on
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
concrete.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
real
and
immediate,
not
conjectural
or
hypothetical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
all
of
our
cases,
we
could
have
left
"in
fact"
out
of
all
of
them.
none
of
them
come
out
differently
because
we
insist
on
injury
in
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
difference
between
legal
harm,
though
--
isn't
that
--
i
guess
i'm
just
repeating
myself.
injury
in
fact.
how
do
you
understand
that
to
be
different
than
any
other
kind
of
injury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
two
elements,
that's
the
particularized
requirement,
and
i
understand
that.
but
you
are
saying
there's
--
injury
in
fact
simply
means
particularized.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
trespass
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
are
different
because
you
are
talking
about
a
property
right,
and
you
can
sell
a
property
right.
you
can
go
to
somebody
and
say
i
have
the
right
to
keep
people
off
of
this
piece
of
property.
do
you
want
to
buy
it?
here's
how
much
it's
worth.
but
if
--
that's
only
a
property
right
to
the
extent
you
can
keep
people
off
of
it.
here
no
one
is
going
to
buy
this
right
from
the
--
the
--
the
plaintiff,
because
everybody's
got
it
anyway.
you
don't
--
you
don't
pay
her,
because
she
doesn't
have
a
tangible
concrete
right.
the
trespass
case,
the
person
obviously
does,
because
he
can
sell
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
this
one
--
that's
my
point.
this
cannot
be
monetized
because
everybody's
already
got
it.
you
can
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
really
a
question,
but
you
can
answer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang.
mr.
panner,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
10-708,
first
american
financial
corporation
versus
edwards.
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
