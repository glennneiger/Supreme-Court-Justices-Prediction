stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
just
get
--
use
an
example,
a
hypothetical
based
on
the
next
case,
really:
i
was
thinking
congress
passes
a
law,
says
you
can't
phone
people
between
7:00
at
night
and
7:00
in
the
morning
and
try
to
sell
them
something,
okay?
that's
the
law.
and
anyone
who
gets
such
a
phone
call
gets
$500
in
damages
automatically
if
they
sue
in
court
if
they
receive
such
a
call.
the
harm
was
getting
the
call.
so
my
grandmother,
who
is
always
complaining
no
one
ever
calls
her,
loved
the
telephone
call.
she
loved
it.
the
best
thing
happened
to
her
in
a
month,
okay?
now,
can
she
sue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
if
the
fda
bans
a
substance
on
the
ground
that
98
percent
of
the
people
it
hurts,
and
there
is
some
kind
of
automatic
recovery,
$500
anybody
who
bought
the
substance
because
it
wasn't
supposed
to
be
sold,
and
she's
one
of
the
2
percent
that
it
helped--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can't
sue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
she
was
exposed,
or
the
plaintiff
was
exposed,
to
the
kind
of
transaction
that
congress
said
was
harmful
as
a
general
matter,
just
like
the
example
you
gave.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
congress
makes
a
finding;
this
is
the
finding:
we
think
that
lawyers
or
whoever
is
engaged
in
these
who
hire
title
insurance
companies
should
hire
the
best
one
on
the
merits,
not
on
the
basis
of
which
one
will
give
them
the
biggest
kickback.
we
think
that's
so
because
that
will
help
keep
people
secure.
everyone
in
such
--
who
buys
a
house
will
feel
more
secure
knowing
that
the
market
worked
there.
we
can't
prove
who
feels
insecure
and
who
doesn't.
we
think
in
general
they
would,
and
so
we
give
everybody
the
right
to
recover
$500
if
they
are
injured,
where
the
injury
consists
of
being
engaged
in
a
transaction
where
the
title
insurance
company
was
not
chosen
on
the
merits,
but
was
chosen
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
basis
of
the
kickback.
and
they
write
that
right
into
the
statute,
so
therefore
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
here
suffered
the
harm
that
congress
sought
to
forbid.
that
harm
was
being
engaged
in
a
transaction
where
the
title
insurance
company
was
not
chosen
on
the
merits,
but
partly
in
terms
of
a
kickback.
now,
what
in
the
constitution
forbids
congress
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
--
i
think
this
is
very
interesting
and
informative
to
me.
go
back
to
the
middle
category.
as
i
am
now
seeing
it,
have
you
a
version
of
the
middle
category
that
the
chief
justice
was
asking.
and
--
and
call
it
congress
sometimes
passes
a
statute
that
creates
a
pariah.
it
could
be
a
substance,
it
could
be
a
form
of
behavior,
it
could
be
a
structure
of
an
industry.
and
then
once
it
does
that,
it
makes
that
unlawful.
and
now
what
it's
done,
it
is
more
unusual
than
i
ever
thought.
it
comes
up
in
the
loyalty
context,
fiduciary,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
fiduciary.
it
says
it
is
a
harm
and
you
will
earn
money
if
you
deal
with
a
pariah,
assuming
it
wasn't
your
fault.
now,
that's
--
that's
where
i
have
ended
up
with
your
answers
to
the
chief,
and
now,
having
put
it
that
way,
i
can
find
loads
of
examples
in
my
mind
where
there
is
a
trustee
or
fiduciary
involved.
i
can
think
of
an
example
in
the
qui
tam
context,
but
to
think
of
one
right
on
point
is
a
little
hard,
though
i
thought
there
must
be
some.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
you
can
sue
in
court
even
if
what
you
come
in
and
you
say,
they
breached
my
contract,
and
as
a
result,
i
made
$10,000
i
wouldn't
have
otherwise
made?
and
when
the
judge
says
"and
what
damages
do
you
seek.
"
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
can
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
liquidated--
mr.
lamken
--
and
that
is
the
majority
rule
today.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
justice
scalia
has
a
point.
i
mean,
as
i
heard
it,
he
was
reiterating
what
used
to
be
called
a
prudential
rule
of
standing.
it
wasn't
constitutional,
but
you
looked
to
see
if
the
statute
is
meant
to
protect
this
kind
of
person
against
that
kind
of
harm,
all
right?
and
if
not,
there
is
lack
of
prudential
standing.
well,
if
that's
the
test,
his
case
would
fall
outside
it,
because
the
tax
law
is
not
meant
to
protect
the
plaintiff
there,
but
this
case
would
fall
within
it.
