but,
counsel,
going
back--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
are
you
taking
a
very
broad
position
that
this
is
an
unusual
state,
it
appears,
with
three
or
four
others,
where
the
states
mandate
that
title
insurance
be
at
a
fixed
price.
but
in
those
states
in
which
there
is
no
such
mandate,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
congress
can't
ever
presume
damages
or
injury,
that
even
in
those
cases
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
in
and
prove
that
they
would
have
paid
less.
is
that
the
position
you
are
taking?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
please
tell
me,
in
those
states
in
which
insurance
is
not
fixed
by
the
state,
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
do
other
than
to
say,
"they
didn't
disclose
to
me
that
there
was
a
kickback
and
i
want
the
amount
i
paid
for
the
service?
"
do
they
have
to
show
something
more?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
in
fact
arguing
very
broadly
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
--
of
injury
in
these
cases,
that
the
plaintiff
still
has
to
come
in
and
prove--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
in
fact
they
would
have
gotten
a
cheaper
--
a
cheaper
policy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
same
thing
with
nominal
damages
and
statutory
damages?
you're
--
you're
taking
a
very
broad
position
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
more
does
this
plaintiff
have
to
allege
other
than,
if
i
had
been
told
that
this
was
a
prearranged,
tied
product
between
the
mortgage
and
the
title
company,
but
that
i
had
a
right
to
get
an
untied
product
even
at
the
same
price,
and
i
would
have
exercised
that
right
if
i
had
known
--
would
that
be
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
that
be
enough
in
--
in
justice
breyer's
example,
of
someone
who
says,
i
received
a
call
at
midnight
and
it
bothered
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
go
back
to
your
position
that
congress
has
no
power
to
give
a
cause
of
action
on
the
basis
of
a
statutory
violation
in
which
it
is
presuming
injury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
certainly
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
sue.
but
if
i
paid
money
that
i
would
have
--
and
that
i'm
entitled
to
get
back,
then
i
have
been
injured,
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
maybe
i'm
just
looking
at
this
too
simply.
you
pay
--
your
client
paid
$455
for
title
insurance,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she
is
claiming
that
she
paid
that
money
on
the
statutory
assumption
that
the
agent
would
disclose
to
her
any
kickbacks,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she
said
i
didn't
receive
what
i
paid
for,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
paid
money,
i
lost
the
money,
i
have
it
back
because
what
i've
bought
was
a
conflict-free--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--referral,
and
that's
not
what
i
got?
