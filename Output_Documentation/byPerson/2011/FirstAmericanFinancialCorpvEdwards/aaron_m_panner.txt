mr.
aaron
m.
panner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
iii
requires
a
private
plaintiff
to
show
injury
in
fact,
which
means
at
a
minimum
that
the
alleged
illegal
conduct
made
her
worse
off.
factual
injury
does
not
automatically
follow
from
violation
of
a
statutory
duty
owed
to
the
plaintiff,
and
ms.
edwards
has
not
alleged
the
type
of
harm
alleged
by
plaintiffs
in
the
common
law
cases
that
she
invokes
--
no
misappropriation
of
her
property,
no
loss
of
desired
opportunity
or
benefit,
no
injury
to
reputation.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
no,
your
honor.
if
she
does
not
have
actual
injury,
the
fact
of
the
statutory
violation
would
not
give
rise
to
standing
in
that
case.
now,
it's
--
i
think
it
would
be
quite
unlikely
that
a
plaintiff
would
come
before
the
court
and
say:
actually
the
statutory
violation
delighted
me;
i
nevertheless
would
like
my
$500.
but
if
the
injury-in-fact
requirement
means
anything,
it
means
that
a
plaintiff
who
comes
before
the
court
must
have
a
harm
in
fact.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--in
the
case
--
in
the
case
in
which
someone
is
exposed
to
a
substance
that
has
--
that
is
illegal,
they
might
well
suffer
a
harm,
and
the
harm
might
be
the
exposure
to
the
substance.
and
the
--
the
sort
of
inquiry
that
you
are
looking
into,
which
is
even
if
the
exposure
ended
up
not
being
harmful,
would
that
be
a
case?
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
that
in
this
case,
the
violation
--
as
her
complaint
makes
clear,
she
paid
the
only
rate
for
title
insurance
available
in
ohio.
she
does
not
complain
of
the
quality
of
the
insurance
or
the
service
she
received.
she
does
not
maintain--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--your
honor,
with
respect
to
unjust
enrichment
cases,
those
cases
reflect
circumstances
where
there
is
a
benefit
received
at
the
expense
of
the
plaintiff.
and
in
--
in
the
traditional
sorts
of
cases
--
unjust
enrichment,
of
course,
is
an
invention
as
a
category
that
is
relatively
recent.
but
unjust
enrichment
cases
reflect
quasi-contract
circumstances,
where
a
benefit
was
conferred,
that
injustice
should
have
been
compensated,
so
the
plaintiff
is
made
worse
off
in
not
receiving
the
benefit
or
the
compensation
for
the
benefit;
or
a
circumstance
of
constructive
trust,
where
there
was
property
or
other
right
of
the
plaintiff
that
was
misappropriated
and
used
without
the
permission
of
the
plaintiff.
so
an
opportunity
or
a
property
was
taken
away.
this
is
not
a
case
like
that,
and
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
is
anything
lacking
in
the
insurance
that
was
issued.
this
is
a
circumstance
in
which
congress
may
believe
that
a
certain
practice
as
a
general
matter
can
tend
to
bring
out
--
bring
about
bad
--
bad
outcomes
and
can
therefore
make
it
unlawful.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
this
plaintiff
has
a
harm--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--no,
your
honor.
the
type
of
injury
that
is
incurred
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
a
financial
one
and
there
could
be
circumstances
where
a
plaintiff
would
allege
an
injury
--
and
i
--
it's
important
to--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--if
the
--
i
want
to
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
but
if
the
question
is,
there
were
various
rates
available
and
the
plaintiff
alleges
an
overcharge,
that
they
purchased
a
--
a
policy
and
there
was
a
cheaper
policy
available,
and
as
a
result
of
the
violation--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--your
--
your
honor--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--your
honor,
the
--
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
allege
in
the
complaint
and
then
eventually
show
that
there
was
some
injury.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
financial
injury.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
again
the
question
for
purposes
of
standing,
the
question
for
purposes
of
the
ability
of
a
plaintiff
to
come
into
court,
is
to
show
that
they
have
some
injury
in
fact,
that
there
is
some
harm,
some
way
in
which
they
were
made
worse
off.
this
plaintiff--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that's
true.
that's
certainly
the
norm
in
all
sort
of
tort
--
tort
cases.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
--
i
did
not
see
any
of
the
cases
that
they
cited
involving
the
trust
--
the
trust
circumstance--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--where
there
was
that
sort
of
vague
allegation.
the
trust
cases
i
think
actually
are
a
good
illustration
of
the
type
of
injury
that
is
required.
we
are
talking
about
trust,
not
antitrust
now.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
but
the
trust
cases
involve
a
circumstance,
the
--
i
think
that
the
plaintiff
here
kind
of
gives
the
game
away
by,
in
the
--
when
talking
about
the
michoud
case,
using
the
phrase
"the
plaintiff
may
sue",
and
of
course
that's
not
what
the
case
says.
what
the
case
says
is
that
a
--
that
a
beneficiary
can
come
into
court
and
say:
the
trust
has
violated
the
duty
to
me;
i
want
to
unwind
the
transaction
to
get
the
benefit
that
i
would
have
gotten
had
the
trustee
behaved
in
the
way
required.
so
in
those
cases
involving
trustees,
for
example,
they--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--there
could
be
automatic
disgorgement,
your
honor.
but
again
that
reflects
the
lost
value
of
what
was
paid
for
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
the
injury
to
the
beneficiary
in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
is
that
the
trustee
would
have
misappropriated
an
opportunity
that
belonged
to
the
beneficiary.
in
the
cases
that
are
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
then,
the
beneficiary
has
the
option
to
say,
i
would
like
to
unwind
that
or
get
the
benefit
that
the
trustee
got,
if
there
was
self-dealing.
but
in
a
circumstance
where
a
trustee
sells,
for
example,
a
piece
of
property
and
the
--
and
the
claim
is
one
for
restitution
to
try
to
unwind
the
transaction
that
was
done,
it's
the
option
of
the
beneficiary
to
say:
you
know
what,
maybe
i
am
wrong
but
i
think
i
would
be
better
off
if
i
could
undo
that
transaction.
so
it's
a
very
conventional
kind
of
harm
where
someone
believes
that
their
property
was
--
was
taken
away
from
them
and
used
in
a
way
to
their
detriment,
and
they
are
therefore
seeking
relief.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
that
might
be
enough,
your
honor.
but
that's
exactly
what
she
didn't
allege.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
yes,
i
think
that
certainly
would
be
enough,
absolutely.
the
--
the
point
is
that
this
complaint
abstracted
away
any
such
particularized
claim
for
a
very
particular
purpose,
which
was
that
in
order
to
maintain
this
case
as
a
class
action
the
basis
of
harm
could
not
be
anything
personal
or
individual
to
this
plaintiff.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
what
congress
cannot
do
is
to
confer
on
a
particular
plaintiff
an
injury
that
is
constitutionally
sufficient
under
article
iii.
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
that
congress
cannot
do
that
and
that
the
existence
of
a
statutory
right
by
itself,
even
the
invasion,
the
violation
of
the
statutory
right
does
not
create
injury
for
constitutional
purposes.
injury--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
your
honor,
you
paid
money
--
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
paid
money
for
a
title
insurance
policy
which
she
received.
she
paid
at
--
at
the
legally
required
rate,
and
she
makes
no
complaint
about
the
policy,
nor
does
she
claim
that
it
would
have
mattered
to
her--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
certainly
if
a
plaintiff
said
that
the
--
that
the
manner
in
which
the
title
insurance
was
provided
had
delayed
her
closing
or
that
there
were
procedures
that
were--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that
there
was
something
about
the
service
that
she
received
as
a
result
of
the
--
the
referral
to
a
particular
title
insurer,
again,
assuming
that
this
is
a
violation,
which
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
it
is.
but
--
but
assuming
that
it
is,
that--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--actually,
most--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
that's
really
--
the
--
the
risk
of
that
is
really
on
the
title
insurer,
which
is
why
the
title
insurer
has
no
incentive
whatsoever
to
encourage
poor
service
by
a
title
insurance
agent.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--she
didn't
allege
it,
and
i
think
that's
critical,
because
the
--
the
issue
is
not
whether
it's
conceivable
that
an
injury
could
occur
from
the
violation.
it
could.
and
what
you
have
indicated
about
difficulty
clearing
objections
to
a
title,
for
example,
if
there
was
a
problem
that
she
had
with
respect
to
that
and
she
believed
it
was
the
case,
that
would
actually
be
the
job
of
the
title
agent,
which
--
and
there
is
no
allegation
that
she
was
improperly
referred
to
the
title
agent.
so
the
insurer
is
issuing
--
underwriting
the
policy
and
bears
the
residual
risk,
but
it's
the
agent
that
is
actually
engaged
with
the
--
with
the
plaintiff
here.
and
there,
the
agent's
name
here
was
tower
city.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
the
constitution,
article
iii,
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it,
requires
that
a
plaintiff
that
comes
into
court
must
have
suffered
an
injury
in
fact,
and
congress
cannot
create
that
injury
legislatively.
otherwise,
the
congress
can
enlist
the
courts
for
regulatory
purposes
that
are
unrelated
to
the
core
function
of
the
court
as
this
court
has
articulated
it.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
if
it
was
a
negotiated
agreement
and
it
was
--
it
was
one
where
the
parties
had
given
value
for
that
assurance,
then
that
would
represent
something
that
there
had
been
a
judgment
in
advance
by
this
particular
individual
that
that
was
something
that
was
a
performance
that
she
was
willing
to
pay
for
and
a
promise
that
meant
something
to
her,
and
so
that
would
potentially
be
a
different
case.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
right.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
most
likely
not,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
that
it's
the
difference
between
a
contract
that
the
parties
engage
in,
where
there
would
be
a
--
if
there's
a
negotiated
contract,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
say,
well,
there's
value
attached
to
the
rights
that
the
parties
have
bargained
for
here.
but
it's
different
if
congress
is
using
it
as
a
mechanism
to
create
injury
legislatively,
and
in
that
circumstance
the
court
would
still
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
injury
in
fact
that
would
allow
the
plaintiff
to
get
into
court.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
i
think
that
congress
could
potentially
create
a
trust
relationship.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
it
would
depend,
your
honor.
not
per
se.
it
would
depend
on
whether
there
was
some
way
in
which
that
violation
caused
an
injury
in
fact.
so,
for
example
--
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
some--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--you
do,
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
any
of
the
examples
that
the
plaintiff
has
cited
there
is
an
underlying
interest,
an
antecedent
interest,
a
concrete
interest
in
property
or
in
an
economic
opportunity,
paid-for
services
of
an
agent,
and
it
is
that
concrete
interest
which
is
invaded
by
the
--
by
the
alleged
violation
of
the
responsibility
of
trust.
but
of
course
here
you
don't
even
have
that
relationship
of
trust.
as--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
situation
would
change.
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
even
--
i
don't
see
any
of
the
common
law
cases
involving
trusts,
trustees,
as
involving
recoveries
or
suits
in
the
absence
of
what
this
court
would
certainly
consider
to
be
an
injury
in
fact,
that
is
to
say
some
harm
to
a
concrete
interest
that
exists
apart
from
the
statutory
duty
or
the
common
law
duty.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
say
that,
your
honor,
so
let
me
try
to
clarify.
the
question
was,
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
legal
relationship
is
such
that
there
could
be
--
let
me
back
up.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
injury
in
fact,
that
is
to
say
a
harm
that
exists
as
a
factual
matter,
and
those
interests
certainly
can
be
reflected
by
the
legal
duties
that
are
created.
so,
for
example,
there
are
legal
duties
in
contract
that
are
intended
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
contracting
parties.
there
are
legal
duties
under
the
law
of
trust
that
are
intended
to
protect
the
beneficiary.
but
this
court
has
frequently
reflected
the
fact
that
there
is
the
question
of
the
violation,
but
then
there
is
separately
the
question
of
the
injury.
and
the
point
that
i'm
making
--
and
it
should
be
the
same
answer
with
respect
to
your
question
and
justice
scalia's
--
is
if
the
mere
fact
of
a
violation
of
a
duty
does
not
create
injury
per
se,
and
none
of
the
cases
reflect
that,
and
that
is
the
proposition
that
plaintiff
relies
on
here,
precisely
because
of
what
she
alleged
and
what
she
is
attempting,
the
type
of
case
that
she
is
attempting
to
bring.
she
is
attempting
to
bring
a
case
in
which
the
statutory
violation
is
the
injury.
no
other
injury
is
required.
she
very
straightforwardly
says,
it
does
not
matter
if
there
is
any
economic
harm,
it
does
not
matter
if
there
is
any
quality
difference,
it
does
not
matter
if
there
is
any
consequential
effect
on
me
at
all.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
again,
i
don't
think
that
the
trust
cases
can
be
fairly
read
to
say
that,
your
honor.
but
the
key
point
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
what
congress
--
the
statutory
duties
that
congress
can
impose
and
the
manner
in
which
congress
can
choose
to
have
those
enforced
--
well--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
at
the
pleading
stage
it
might
be,
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
that
if
the
question
were
whether
there
was
an
allegation,
certainly
it's
possible
that
there
could
be
a
sufficiently
concrete
allegation
in
a
complaint
that
there
was
that
sort
of
an
impact,
but
--
and
this
is
critical
--
not
only
was
that
not
alleged
here,
but
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
statutory
duty
does
not
reflect
that's
the
judgment
or,
you
know,
the
fact
that
there's
been
any
sort
of
many
systemic
effect.
congress
has
broadly
prohibited
practices
involving
kickbacks
and
the
paradigm
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
situation
in
which
a
title
insurance
agent
is
issuing
a
title
insurance
policy
for
an
underwriter.
now,
it's
not
to
say
that
congress
can't
pass
a
broader
prohibition
and
--
you
know,
and
require
that
it
be
enforced.
well,
congress
can
pass
a
broader
prohibition
and
then
the
executive
could
enforce
it.
but
what
congress
cannot
do
is
to
dictate
in
advance
that
a
particular
practice
has
caused
injury
to
a
particular
plaintiff.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
a
connection
between
the
violation
alleged
and
the
harm
that
ensues,
and
so
a
general
understanding
that--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well
--
well,
again,
that
wasn't
alleged
here.
so
the
question--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
so
the
question
would
be
particular
to
the
allegations
that
were
made.
in
a
case
like
this
one,
it's
in
all
likelihood
a
generic
allegation
that
there
had
been
--
that
there
was
some
sort
of
systemic
effect
is
--
it
would
be
insufficient.
that
would
be
a
speculative
sort
of
claim
of
harm
and
that
would
be
really
something
where
if
it's
a
general
systemic
effect
with
no
traceability
between
the
violation
that's
alleged
and
any
supposed
harm
to
the
plaintiff,
that
that
would
be
something
for
the
executive.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
reserve--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
depend.
i
mean,
certainly
there
are
all
sorts
of
circumstances
where
there
is
broad
systemic
harm,
but
yet
the
harm
to
the
plaintiff
is
very
clear,
if
you
think
about,
for
example,
about
price-fixing.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
positions
that
have
been
articulated
before
the
court
and
both
are
inconsistent
with
the
court's
prior
decisions.
the
first
is--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--that
of
the
--
that
of
the
plaintiff
and
that
of
the
government,
your
honor.
i
should
have
been
more
particularized.
[laughter]
the
violation
of
a
duty
owed
to
us,
that
is
what
plaintiff
claims
is
the
injury
here.
the
violation
of
a
duty
is
a
violation
of
a
duty;
it
is
not
injury.
and
similarly
the
government
says
that
what
is
required
is
a
sufficient
connection
to
the
conduct,
but
what
is
required
is
not
a
connection
to
the
conduct,
what
is
required
is
an
injury-in-fact,
a
harm
to
the
plaintiff
who
is
seeking
to
obtain
redress
from
the
courts.
and
that
fundamental
limitation
on
the
role
of
the
courts
is
critical
to
the
liberty
of
the
people
who
come
before
the
courts
and
who
are
subject
to
the
power
of
the
courts.
it
is
absolutely
appropriate
for
someone
who
has
been
harmed
through
the
violation
of
a
statutory
or
common
law
duty
owed
to
that
person
to
come
before
the
court
seeking
redress,
but
what
is
not
possible
is
for
the
courts
to
be
open
to
a
plaintiff
who
has
not
alleged
that
the
statutory
duty
--
the
statutory
violation
that
has
been
alleged
has
caused
any
adverse
impact.
now
of
course
there
are
broadly
--
there
are
--
there
is
illegal
conduct
that
may
have
caused
harm
to
a
broad
section
of
the
population.
if
somebody
engages
in
price
fixing
and
then
sells
those
price
fixed
goods
it
may
be
easy
to
show
that
as
a
result
of
that
many
people
suffered
harm
and
can
come
into
court
to
sue
for
it.
similarly,
there
are
non-financial
harms
that
for
are
the
basis
for
standing
in
many,
many
cases:
example,
defamation,
harm
to
reputation,
discrimination
where
somebody
is
subject
to
a
--
an
injury
of
being
discriminated
against.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
in
--
in
a
circumstance
in
which
there
is
a
bargain
for
performance,
and
it
may
well
be
that
there
is
a
recognition
that
there
is
value
that
was
assigned
to
that
performance
that
may
be
hard
to
measure,
and
therefore
there
is
a
concrete
injury
that
is
hard
to
measure,
and
the
therefore
nominal
damages
is
awarded.
now
the
cases
are
not
uniform
on
whether
nominal
damages
are
available.
there
is
a
--
it's
actually
split
and
that
there's
--
we
are
not
aware
of
a
case
in
this
court
that
would
say
that
in
a
circumstance
in
which
there
was
a
harmless
breach,
that
--
that
a
suit
for
nominal
damages
would
establish
article
iii
standing,
so
with
respect
to
that
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answers
would
be.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions?
