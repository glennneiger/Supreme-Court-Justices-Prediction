because
she
can't
prove
it
at
the
early
stage,
and
the
problem
that
congress
was
concerned
about
was
that
you
can't
tell
until
the
house
is
going
to
be
sold
in
the
end
how
adequate
the
title
insurance
was.
so
congress
is
acting
on
the
potential
that
these
kind
of
kickbacks
can
cause
harm.
and
this
does
seem
to
fit
the
bill
of
restitution,
unjust
enrichment
cases,
where
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to
prove
any
harm,
she
just
gets
back
what
the
defendant
should
not
have
received.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
she
appended
to
her
complaint
an
affidavit
by
a
well-respected
economist
that
says:
congress
was
right;
these
kind
of
arrangements
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
people
who
are
purchasing
title
insurance,
and
goes
through
all
kinds
of
analyses
that
show
that.
would
that
be
adequate
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
lamken,
you
are
not
seeking
damages.
you
are
seeking
what
the
statute
says
you
can
get
which
is
your
money
back
treble?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
that
you
have
to
prove--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--any
other
damages
because
the
statute
has
specified
what
the
recovery
is.
