justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
along
that
line,
are
there
any
trust
cases
that
--
that
respondents
or
the
government
could
cite
in
which
a
party
can
go
into
court
alleging
that
the
market
has
been
distorted,
even
though
that
person
has
no
damage?
anything
like
that
in
the
antitrust?
what
would
be
their
closest
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
not
automatic
disgorgement
in
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that
--
that
leads
me
to
this
point.
i
thought
--
i
never
thought
of
title
insurance
companies
as
being
fungible,
and
some
were
very,
very
good
about
narrowing
the
exceptions,
about
working
with
the
seller
of
the
property,
if
you
represented
the
buyer,
to
get
rid
of
the
exceptions.
and
so
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
just
a
question
of
a
policy
versus
no
policy.
there's
a
--
there's
a
quality
to
the
--
to
the
research
they
do.
and
the
next
--
and
related
to
that
is
this:
you
--
you
put
the
case
as
if
the
price
is
going
to
be
the
same
for
the
insurance.
a,
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
state
law
that
permits
the
insurance
company
to
get
--
to
set
a
lower
rate;
and
second,
don't
the
title
companies
charge
other
fees,
title
search
fees
and
so
forth,
other
fees
in
addition
to
the
price
of
the
insurance?
and
those
other
fees,
arguably
--
i
know
she
didn't
allege
any
damage
--
but
those
other
fees
arguably
are
too
high
because
of
this
fixed
market.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
she
didn't
allege
that.
i
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
following
up
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
suppose
the
congress
works
with
economists
and
concludes
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
if
there
were
no
kickbacks
there
would
be
a
more
competitive
market,
there
would
be
lower
prices
for
some
of
the
escrow
fees,
some
of
the
collateral
fees
in
addition
to
the
title
insurance.
and
the
plaintiff
then
alleges
that
there
is
this
reasonable
probability
that
there
would
be
a
more
efficient
market,
resulting
in
cost
savings.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
person
alleges:
and
i
was
in
this
market
and
i
might
have
--
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
i
could
have
had
a
lower
price,
according
to
economic
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
assuming
it's
alleged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me,
just
with
justice
alito's
automobile
hypothetical,
just
as
a
matter
of
agency
law
--
i'm
a
little
rusty
on
this
one.
if
the
auto
repair
people
phone
and
say,
and
you
need
two
parts
and
we
will
purchase
those
parts
for
you,
and
they
then
purchase
parts
from
a
company
that
they
own,
under
standard
agency
law
could
the
vehicle
owner
get
disgorgement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
he
doesn't
know,
they
haven't
been
informed--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
--
but
it's
circular
for
you
to
say
he
was
denied
something
that
he
is
entitled
to.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
injury.
the
constitution
requires
an
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
to
say
he
was
entitled
to
it
and
therefore,
there
is
an
injury,
that's
just
--
that's
just
circular.
that
gives
no
substance
at
all
to
the
--
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
"injury".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
about
trespass.
the
object
of
my
owning
property
is
that
i
have
a
right
to
exclude.
this
is
what
i
own.
this
is
what
the
law
protects.
this
is
a
spatial
area
for
--
for
my
--
which
is
my
own
domain.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
--
there
is
an
injury
to
that
right.
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
want
to
say
that
congress
can
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
buy
a
conflict-free
title
insurance
policy.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
two
equate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
essential
to
my
--
it's
essential
to
my
feeling
of
security
and
dignity
and
privacy.
like
justice
breyer's
telephone
hypothetical.
