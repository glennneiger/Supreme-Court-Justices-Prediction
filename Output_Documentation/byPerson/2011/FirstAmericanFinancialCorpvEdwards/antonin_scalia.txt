justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so
extraordinary.
it
is
what
has
to
be
shown
in
--
in
sherman
act
cases,
right?
contracts
and
combinations
in
--
in
restraint
of
trade
are
unlawful;
but
in
order
to
recover
under
the
sherman
act,
you
have
to
show
not
only
that
it
was
unlawful,
but
that
you
were
harmed
by
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
--
let's
assume
that
a
trustee
acts
on
its
own
interest
and
--
and
sells
property.
but
let's
assume
that
he
gets
top
dollar
for
that
property,
so
that
the
beneficiary
hasn't
really
been
deprived
of
anything.
what
is
the
injury
to
the
beneficiary?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
a
different
case.
could
congress
decree
that
the
agent
in
this
case
shall
be
an
agent
of
the
purchaser
rather
than
an
agent
of
the
title
insurance
company,
as
is
done
in
real
estate,
i
think?
the
real
estate
broker
must
be
an
agent
of
the
seller
and
not
of
the
purchaser.
can
it
establish
a
trust
relationship
between
the
purchaser
here
and
the
person
selecting
the
title
insurance
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
did,
would
the
violation
of
that
trust
relationship
constitute
injury
for
--
for
article
iii
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
require
injury
in
fact
for
most
breaches
of
trust,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand,
but
i'm
just
saying
that
that
concrete
interest
can
be
created
by
congress
instead
of
being
created
by
contract.
what
difference
does
it
make?
if
you
become
a
trustee
by
contract
you
get
one
result,
but
if
you
are
a
trustee
by
government
decree
so
that
you
must
be
a
trustee,
contract
or
not,
somehow
the
situation
changes?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
speak
of
a
duty
of
loyalty.
there
is
no
duty
of
loyalty
owed
here.
it
was
just
a
law
that
said
you
cannot
get
--
and
i'm
not
even
sure
it's
proper
to
call
it
a
kickback.
it's
a
commission.
these
people
are
agents
for
the
title
insurance
company
and
they
get
a
commission
on
--
on
every
sale
of
title
insurance
that
they
make.
you
can
call
it
a
kickback,
i
suppose.
i
don't
know
why
the
other
side
does.
but,
but
--
but
it
seems
to
me
a
commission.
there
is
no
duty
of
loyalty.
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
seller
here
the
agent
of
the
title
insurance
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
we'd
have
a
different
--
we'd
have
a
different
case
then.
but
they
didn't
do
that,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
issue
isn't
whether
they
can
afford
it
legal
protection.
they
certainly
can.
and
there
can
be
suits
by
--
by
the
federal
government
or
i
think
under
this
statute
even
by
state,
state
attorneys
general.
the
issue
isn't
whether
congress
can
achieve
that
result.
it's
whether
they
can
achieve
it
by
permitting
private
suits.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
take
my
car
to
an
auto
mechanic,
he's
not
my
agent.
he's
an
independent
contractor
doing
business.
he's
not
my
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
not
an
agency
relation
here,
either.
it's
a
customer
going
to
somebody
who
is
an
independent
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
agents
and
fiduciaries
across
the
board.
he
is
neither
an
agent
nor
a
fiduciary.
and
what's
the
closest
case
you
have
to
a
situation
where
there
is
neither
an
agency
relationship
nor
a
trust
relationship,
and
yet
this
kind
of
a
right
to
sue
without
showing
damage
exists?
what's
your
--
what's
your
best
shot?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
want
to
have
to
prove
that,
because
if
you
proved
any
damage,
there
goes
your
class
action--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
you
don't
have
commonality.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
it
--
how
does
it
harm
her
to
get
a
title
insurance
policy
for
the
price
of
$453
from
what
you
call
a
kickback-free
seller,
as
opposed
to
getting
the
same
title
insurance
for
$453
from
a
non-kickback-free
seller?
is
that
an
injury-in-fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
--
the
vague
notion
of
--
of
buying
it
from
--
from
--
i
don't
know,
a
white
knight?
is
--
is
that
the
kind
of
injury-in-fact
that
our
cases
talk
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
purely
--
i
don't
know,
philosophical.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
congress
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
business.
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
congress
can
get
out
of
the
business,
whether
it
is
the
function
of
courts
to
provide
relief
to
people
who
haven't
been
injured.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
--
that's
the
whole
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
--
mr.
yang,
let
me
--
me
give
--
give
you
a
hypothetical.
suppose
congress
did
this
to
spare
the
attorney
general
the
necessity
of
suing
to
enforce
these
requirements.
suppose
congress
wants
to
take
the
burden
off
the
back
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
so
it
says
that
anybody
who
buys
any
product
from
a
company
that
has
not
paid
its
taxes
is
entitled
to
$500,
okay?
what
that
person
is
entitled
to
is
a
--
a
tax-observant
seller
--
given
a
national
right
to
a
tax-observant
seller.
would
every
person
who
buys
from
some
--
some
company
that
hasn't
paid
its
taxes
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
differentiated.
you
have
to
have
bought
from
one
of
these
companies.
it's
not
everybody.
not
everybody
has
bought
from
these
tax
cheats.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
the
people
who
bought
from
tax
cheats.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
nexus,
right?
your
brief
is
full
of
nexus.
justice
antonin
scalia
legal
jargon
for
"connection".
justice
antonin
scalia
lovely.
say
connection,
i
might
add.
i
love
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
much
of
a
connection
is
--
is
necessary?
suppose
you
--
you
have
a
law
that
requires
all
machine
parts
produced
by
companies
to
--
to
contain
a
certain
feature,
and
anyone
who
buys
one
that
doesn't
contain
that
feature
gets
$500.
i
purchase
one.
that
feature
is
of
no
use
to
me
at
all.
that
product
would
be
just
as
good
for
me
for
the
purposes
for
which
i
am
using
it
had
it
not
had
that
feature.
would
that
be
okay?
would
i
have
a
cause
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
even
though
i've
installed
my
own
safety
harness,
which
i
always
do
when
i
buy
a
car,
i
can
sue
because
this
car
that
they
sold
me
didn't
have
the
safety
harness.
500
bucks.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
specific
--
i'm
sorry,
chief,
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
yours
and
his?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
your
--
your
concluding
marks,
but
i
am
troubled
by
the
dollar
nominal
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
