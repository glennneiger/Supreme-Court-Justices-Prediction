mr.
mark
a.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
last
half-hour
has
made
clear
that
what
really
is
at
issue
here
is
a
challenge
to
fda's
administration
of
the
orange
book.
that
is
an
apa
challenge,
not
this
counterclaim.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
if
when
fda
was
writing
the
use
codes
did
it
describe
the
scope
of
the
patent,
and
mr.
hurst
said
yes.
that's
false.
the
answer
is
no.
for
example,
if
i
could
point
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
522,
these
are
some
fda-authored
use
codes.
everything
before
u530
is
an
fda-authored
use
code.
u275.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
page
522,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
u275,
"method
of
use
of
the
drug
substance.
"
u278,
"method
of
use
of
the
indication
of
the
drug
product.
"
u279,
"method
of
use
of
the
approved
product.
"
these
were
the
ones
that
the
fda
wrote
when
it
was
responsible
for
writing
use
codes
to
put
the
world
on
notice.
so
u-278,
method
of
use
of
the
indication
of
the
product,
the
patent
relates
to
secondary
hyperparathyroidism,
but
you
will
never
know
that
from
the
use
codes,
and
that's
when
the
fda
was
writing
it.
in
2003,
fda
decided
to
turn
it
over
to
the
industry.
and
it
said
in
this
rule
making,
and
you've
heard
about
the
rule
making
but
not
what
fda
actually
said.
it
said
to
this:
19
a
of
the
reply
brief.
this
is
68
federal
register
page
36,682.
"we
believe
an
approach
that
requires
the
nda
applicant
or
holder
or
patent
owner
to
identify
the
approved
methods
of
use
protected
by
the
patent
is
most
consistent
with
the
general
balance
adopted
in
the
hatch-waxman
act.
"
"and
then
the
generic
industry
during
this
very
rule
making
made
all
of
the
arguments
that
mr.
hurst
has
made
today,
said
we
should
have
more
of
a
challenge,
we
should
have
litigation
and
so
forth,
and
the
fda
said
no,
that's
not
right,
because
that
would
let
the
generics
pick
it.
"
and
we
said
--
they
said,
we
shouldn't
do
that.
and
this
is
important.
this
is
on
page
24(a)
of
the
reply
brief.
the
fda
said
very
clearly,
"there
would
be
repeated
litigation
over
individual
patent
lifting
decisions.
"
that's
a
bad
idea,
the
fda
said,
because
there
is
no
assurance
that
ndas
would
be
approved
sooner
or
generic
drugs
would
enter
the
market
any
more
rapidly.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
there
are
several
alternatives,
your
honor.
first,
the
fda
could
de-link
the
indications
from
use
codes.
right
now
the
regulations
say
that
you
can
base
your
use
code
on
the
indication
or
use
code
as
identical
or
indication
applies
with
every
regulation.
you
didn't
hear
mr.
horwich
say
that
fda
thinks
our
use
code
is
wrong.
fda
has
accepted
our
use
code.
caraco
filed
an
administrative
challenge
to
the
use
code
arguing
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
the
apa.
and
that's
the
way
agency
actually
gets
challenged
in
the
ordinary
course
as
this
court
has
seen
it
many
times.
not
here.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
they
have
chosen
to
make
it
a
ministerial
act,
which
is
not
a
negative,
by
the
way.
it
is
the
federal
drug
--
federal
food
and
drug
administration.
what
they
do
is
administer
this
program.
and
they
have
in
other
areas,
such
a
patent
term
extensions,
entered
into
memorandums
of
understanding
with
pto
where
there
are
patent
issues
so
that
there
is
interagency
cooperation
to
deal
with
patent
issues.
they
could
do
that
here
but
they
have
chosen
not
to,
and
in
the
exercise
of
their
enforcement
discretion
said:
we
are
going
to
accept
the
anda
applicant's
submission.
and,
more
importantly,
fda
has
made
the
policy
decision
to
tie
the
section
viii
determination
to
the
use
code.
they
don't
have
to
do
that.
that's
not
in
the
statute.
they
could
change
that
by
rule
making.
and
third,
on
the
indication,
for
example,
novo's
use
code
always
follows
the
indication.
the
change
in
this
case
is
because
fda
changed
the
indication.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
there
have
been
about
a
dozen
apa
challenges
to
various
aspects
of
this
administration
in
the
dc
circuit
over
the
past
ten
years.
the
generics
have
won
several
of
them
including
most
importantly
the
purepac
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
is
direct
challenge
to
fda's
refusal
of
a
section
viii
carveout
because
of
the
use
code,
and
the
generic
won
that
argument.
it
said
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
the
agency
to
do
what
it
did.
so
--
look,
every
apa
battle
is
an
uphill
battle.
they're
the
plaintiff.
they
burden
--
the
burden
of
proof.
it
is
an
available
remedy.
you
couple
that,
your
honors,
with
the--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--in
purepac,
your
honor,
the
brand
changed
its
position
but
the
fda
did
not
change
its
position
accordingly.
and
that
was
the
arbitrariness
there.
here
of
the
brand
changed
its
position
and
the
fda
went
along.
so
i
don't
think
they
would
win
that
case,
to
be
clear,
in
our
particular
facts.
that's
because
novo
has
done
nothing
wrong.
i
mean,
you've
heard
about,
a
lot
about
over
breadth,
misleading,
blah,
blah,
blah.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
novo's
use
code
if
the
agency
agrees
with
that.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
breyer,
your
question
conflated
as
caraco
often
does,
the
use
and
the
indication.
you
quoted
the
indication,
that
is,
a
method
of
improving
hypoglycemic
control.
the
use
is
repaglinide
combined
with
metformin.
they
are
disclosed
in
different
parts
of
the
label.
the
indication
is
under
indications,
and
the
use
is
under
dosage
and
administration.
that
is
the
way
fda
has
always
administered
this,
and
that's
the
distinction
between
indication
and
method
of
use,
which
why
the
regulations
and
the
form
are
written
in
the
alternative.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
that
is
the
indication
that--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--it
is
not
patent
information
submitted
under
(b)
or
(c)
of
section
505
which
is
the
statutory
language.
it
is
information
submitted
under
314.53(p)
and
(e)
of
the
regulation,
which
is
a
different
question.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
the
regulation
was
issued
under
section
701,
the
general
rulemaking
authority.
they
cite
section
505,
but
there
was
a
subsequent
rulemaking
when
pharma,
the
trade
association
for
the
branded
industry,
challenged
fda's
authority
to
require
all
this
information.
and
then
in
2007
rulemaking
that
my
friends
on
this
side
never
cite,
fda
came
back
and
explained
that
our
--
that
the
patent
submission
reg
is
based
on
section
701
to
facilitate
the
section
viii
and
anda
process,
not
an
interpretation
of
section
505.
and
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
interpretations
of
the
statute.
drug--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i'm
sorry,
the
2007
rulemaking
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--you
honor,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
my
colleague
will
hand
up
to
you
momentarily.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
in
the
red
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
breyer--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--to
further
answer
your
question--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--justice
breyer,
there
is
another
point
on
the
structure
of
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
chart
in
the
back
of
our
red
brief
where
we
tried
to
lay
out
the
various
provisions
of
the
actual
statute,
the
counterclaim
that
the
court
read
and
that
we
are
focused
on
talks
about
"a"
use.
and
in
the
preamble
it
says,
"if
the
patentholder
claims
a
use--
"
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--so--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
a
section--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
patent
information
submitted
under
(b)
and
(c)
of
section
505,
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that's
right.
and
we
know
that
because
the
congress
at
the
same
time
debated
it,
an
alternative
bill
that
was
sponsored
by
the
democrats
that
had
lots
and
lots
of
additional
patent
information.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
it's
important
to
remember
the
counterclaim
is
only
a
delisting
provision.
it
is
a
very
narrow
provision.
the
ftc
report
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
identified
eight
cases
in
the
first
18
years
of
hatch-waxman
that
raised
this
problem
of
improper
listing,
mostly
due
to
successive
30-month
stays.
that
was
fixed
in
the
counterclaim,
and
the
30-month
stays
were
fixed
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
since
--
since
2003
there
has
never
been--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--the
counterclaim
addressed
the
problem
of
improper
listing
that
was
addressed
in
the
ftc
report.
the
purpose
of
the
counterclaim,
according
to
its
sponsors,
and
according
to
the
conference
report,
the
listing
of
improper
patents,
that
problem
has
gone
away.
there
is
no
such
problem
any
more.
it
has
never
come
up
again.
the
counterclaim
was
entirely
successful
in
solving
the
problem
that
congress
set
out
to
address.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
use
codes.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
what
the
ftc
report
explained
was
that
certain
branded
companies
near
the
expiration
of
the
listed
patent
would
come
in
and
file
a
second
patent
in
the
orange
book,
even
though
it
was
not
properly
listed,
it
didn't
fit
within
section
505(b)
in
the
listing
requirements,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
second
30-month
stay,
essentially
to
box
out
the
generic
companies;
and
that
that
was
an
anticompetitive
action.
they
recommended
the
counterclaim
to
fix
that,
and
at
the
same
time
the
ftc
said
if
congress
were
to
enact
such
a
counterclaim
it
is
unclear
how
frequently
it
ever
would
be
used.
so
this
was
always
intended
to
be
a
very
narrow
--
it's
not
a
fix-all
remedy.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
no,
your
honor.
my
argument
is
very
simple.
a
delisting
question,
it's
an
on/off
switch.
either
the
patent
is
properly
listed
in
the
orange
book
or
it's
not.
the
counterclaim
gives
the
generic
a
one-shot
knock-out
remedy.
if
it's
not
properly
delisted
it
goes
away,
and
a
bunch
of
things
follow
from
that.
there
is
no
30-month
stay,
there
is
no
paragraph
iv
litigation,
there
is
no
impediment
to
fda
approving
the
anda,
because
if
the
patent
isn't
listed
in
the
orange
book
then
a
whole
separate
set
of
anda
approval
requirements
kick
in.
a
use
code
is
nothing
like
that.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
usual
case
is
it's
not
listed
because
it
doesn't
fit.
the
most
famous
example,
the
buspar
case
that
claimed
a
metabolite
rather
than
the
drug
substance
and
that
wasn't
the
proper
listing
for
that
reason.
the
correction
language
which
does
come
out
of
the
other
bill,
the
alternative
bill,
and
we
do
think
is
an
artifact
as
the
language
is
used,
is
there
to
give
flexibility
to
courts.
if
you
have
a
situation
of
an
improperly
listed
patent,
then
the
court
has
more
flexibility
than
simply
delisting.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
because,
your
honor,
if
the
generic
raises
a
counterclaim
and
if
it's
delisted,
the
generic
gets
no
more
180-day
marketing
exclusivity
stay
at
the
end
of
the
anda
process.
if
it's
corrected
through
a
different
patent
number,
the
generic
would
still
have
its
180-day
exclusivity.
so
there
is
every
incentive
for
the
generic
to
bring
a
counterclaim
for
a
correction
if
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
and
again,
it
just
gives
more
flexibility
to
the
courts.
that
is
something
that
very
much
would
benefit
the
generic
and
it
would
be
available
use
of
the
word
"correct".
it
may
be
an
unusual
one,
but
it's
certainly
available.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
the
transposition
is
not
the
problem.
the
more
frequent
--
the
way
we
think
it
would
come
up
is
these
branded
companies
have
large
portfolios
of
patents,
they
list
many
patents
in
the
orange
book.
you
know,
novo
has
five
or
six
right
now.
other
companies
have
many
more,
dozens
and
dozens.
they
write
these
use
codes
and
they
associate
them
with
the
patents.
and
in
the
orange
book
--
by
the
way,
it
is
called
"the
orange
book"
because
it's
orange.
and
it's
thick.
it's
got
a
lot
of
information
in
it.
it
has
to
list
every
single
approved
drug
with
the
use
code.
i
mean,
it's
just
pages
and
pages
of
numbers
is
what's
in
here.
it's
not
a
transposition
of
numbers,
but
rather
the
listing
of
one
patent
and
improperly
associating
it
with
a
drug.
that
could
be
corrected
through
this
counterclaim.
but
again,
that's
worlds
away
from
this
use
code
challenge,
which
is
really
what
caraco
wants
to
bring,
something
that
wasn't
on
congress's
radar
screen
because
fda
wrote
the
use
codes
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
that
--
the
indication
is
correct.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor,
that
argument
was
made
to
the
fda
by
the
generic
industry
in
the
1994
rulemaking,
the
first
time
this
issue
came
up,
and
they
said:
you
should
not
allow
use
codes
to
be
based
on
indications;
you
should
instead
require
a
description
of
the
patented
method-of-use.
you
heard
mr.
hurst
say
that
again
this
morning.
here's
what
fda
said
in
response.
quote:
it's
page
59,
federal
register
page
50,346,
"for
a
use
patent,
fda
includes
in
the
orange
book
a
code
identifying
the
indication
covered
by
the
patent.
"
"we
decline
to
expand
the
orange
book
to
include
patent
descriptions.
"
then
it
went
on
to
explain
that
persons
interested
in
patent
descriptions
should
consult
the
official
gazette--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--first,
the
regulation
is
not
an
interpretation
of
505(b).
it's
an
implementation
of
701.
second
and
more
substantively,
however,
the
form
--
you
quoted
accurately
from
box
4.2(b)
of
the
form.
there
is
also
box
4.2(a)
of
the
form,
which
includes
the
description
of
the
method
of
use
tied
to
the
label,
which
is
required
by
subsection
(p)
of
the
regulation
that
you
were
just
quoting
to
me.
in
that
part
of
the
form,
novo
very
carefully
describes
claim
4
of
the
patent
and
ties
it
to
the
dosage
and
administration
and
clinical
pharmacology
sections
of
the
patent
and
calls
out
by
reference
combination
trials.
the
only
combination
trial
in
the
label
is
the
metforminrepaglinide
combination.
and
in
fda
--
that
that
is
a
sufficiently
--
because
these
forms,
by
the
way,
you
have
got
them
in
here,
are
these
little
tiny
boxes,
you
can't
put
very
much
information
in
there.
that
is
described
in
there.
it
is
not
that
every
piece
of
information
required
by
the
regulation
--
the
regulation
has
19
lettered
questions,
of
which
several
have
subparts,
so
it's
26
separate
pieces
of
information.
they're
not
provided
in
one
box,
box
4.2(b).
there
is
actually
a
whole
form.
it's
four
pages
long.
we
filled
it
all
out.
and
there
is
an
important
point,
justice
breyer.
this
is
a
summary
judgment
case.
we
put
in
a
declaration
from
an
fda
expert
--
it's
in
the
record
before
the
court
--
explaining
how
every
single
box
ties
to
every
single
thing
in
the
regulation.
that's
absolutely
undisputed
on
this
record.
there
is
no
contrary
evidence
as
to
novo
doing
anything
wrong.
so
whether
congress
--
to
go
back
to
this
counterclaim,
we
know
congress
didn't
intend
it
to
reach
this
form,
because
this
form
didn't
exist
when
congress
was
debating
the
counterclaim.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--i
think
--
i
think
i
can
do
no
better
than
refer
the
court
again
to
the
2007
rulemaking
--
justice
scalia,
72
federal
register
page
21268
--
which
the
united
states
does
not
address
and
which
caraco
does
not
address,
in
which
fda
addressed
your
point,
justice
breyer,
and
explained
that
this
information
--
while
useful,
and
we
have
never
challenged
fda's
authority
to
require
the
information,
but
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
that
language
patent
information
--
this
quote
(c)
is--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--correct.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
it
is
certainly--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
first,
the
counterclaim
has
no
work
to
do
for
use
codes.
there
is
a
complete
disconnect
there,
so--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor,
it
is
going
to
add
complexity,
expense
and
so
forth.
the
reason
--
the
problems
with
all
civil
litigation,
all
new
causes
of
action
--
and
this
was
raised
during
the
congressional
debates,
when
they
proposed
a
freestanding
cause
of
action
for
generics
to
sue
over
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
congress
was
up
in
arms,
and
said
no,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that
because
we
don't
want
to
let
private
parties
into
the
fda
process.
this
court
is
familiar
with
that
and
the
parade
of
horribles
from
the
buckman
case.
mr.
mark
a.
perry
justice
kagan,
this
statute
was
a
political
compromise.
there
is
no
debate
on
the
historical
record
about
that.
and
the
compromise
that
mr.
hurst
indicated
earlier
was
that
the
statute
would
deal
with
some
things
--
the
counterclaim
would
deal
with
some
things,
delisting
--
and
almost
everything
else
would
be
turned
over
to
the
fda.
and
fda
had
this
extensive
rulemaking,
that
as
<mister>
[=
mr.]
hurst
said,
congress
was
aware
of.
and
during
that
rulemaking,
congress
did
several
things.
first,
it
confirmed
that
the
industry
would
write
use
the
use
code.
second,
that
use
codes
could
be
based
on
indication.
so
there
is
no
extension
of
the
patent
monopoly.
it
is
simply
following
fda's
instructions
as
to
indication
of
use
code--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--no.
your
honor,
we
will
--
they
will
be
sued
for
infringement
if
they
ever
go
to
market,
because
the
generic
substitution
laws
present
in
49
state
require
or
allow
pharmacists
to
substitute
the
products
whether
or
not
the
combination
is
on
the
label.
so
there
will
always
be
an
infringement
suit,
which
gets
back
to
justice
kagan's
question:
why
would
congress
have
contemplated?
they
didn't
contemplate
this.
they
contemplated
delisting,
where
you
take
it
out
of
the
infringement
suit
altogether.
this
issue,
indications
use
code,
section
viii,
that
is
all
within
the
agency,
but
there
is
a
litigation
problem
with
it
or
challenge
to
it,
that
is
what
the
apa
is
for.
and
again,
there
have
been
dozens
of
apa
cases
where
the
generics
largely
have
challenged
fda's
determinations
in
that
respect.
it
is
not
what
the
counterclaim
is
for.
this
is
a
very
narrow
provision.
what
we're
--
we're
parsing,
by
the
way,
two
clauses
in
one
sentence
of
a
statute
--
the
2003
amendments
were
415
pages
long.
the
hatch-waxman
act
is
thousands
of
provisions
long.
very
delicate
balance
between
lots
of
competing
interests,
billions
of
dollars
at
stake.
and
we
have
to
be
careful.
when
congress
creates
a
new
course
of
action,
the
law
of
unintended
consequences
kicks
in
here.
we
know
this
is
not
--
this
case
is
not
what
congress
intended.
the
counterclaim
we
don't
believe
can
be
read
it
all
to
it.
even
if
it's
ambiguous.
putting
it
in
context
and
looking
at
what
fda
has
actually
said
about
these
matters
in
its
rulemaking,
when
it's
faced
with
the
same
challenges
that
a
generic
industry
that
mr.
hurst
presented
here
--
it
has
rejected
them
over
and
over
again--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--in
this
case,
justice
alito,
there
were
two
points:
first,
fda
rejected
caraco's
administrative
challenge
to
the
use
code.
they
could
have
taken
that
to
the
d.c.
circuit
under
the
apa.
second,
they
have
indicated
a
rejection
of
their
section
viii
carve-out
because
of
the
use
code.
they
could
take
that
to
the
d.c.
circuit
under
the
<apa>
[=
apa].
that
is
the
usual
course
for
challenging
agency
action.
if
there
are
any
problems
here
--
our
position
is,
we
have
complied
in
every
respect
at
every
moment
with
every
bit
of
fda's
regulations.
and
again,
that
--
that's
what
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows.
so
again,
i
need
to
push
back
a
little
on
extensions
and
monopolies
and
so
forth,
because
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case
is
about
a
properly
working
administrative
process,
and
should
in
private
litigation
between
two
parties
in
which
the
fda
will
not
be
a
party,
should
that
regulatory
regime
be
dismantled.
you
know
--
and
we
actually
asked
to
bring
the
fda
in,
in
this
case.
novo
did.
and
caraco
resisted
that.
you
know,
we
think
that
if
you're
going
to
debate
the
administration
of
the
orange
book,
it
should
be
under
the
apa--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
a.
perry
--mylan,
in
the
response
gives
the
generic
a
one-shot
remedy,
and
you
are
out
of
it
altogether.
and
it's
a
black-and-white
decision.
it's
an
on-off
switch.
either
the
patent
is
properly
listed
or
not.
in
a
use
code
of
the
orange
book,
there
are
over
1000
of
them.
they
are
shades
of
gray.
there
are
--
there
are
very
specific
ones,
very
general
ones.
i
read
to
the
court
some
of
the
ones
that
the
fda
itself
wrote.
you
would
get
into
these
long
involved
questions
about
compliance
and
so
forth
--
to
the
effect,
congress
wanted
to
make
generic
approvals
quicker
in
the
mylan
situation.
fda
itself,
and
i
started
out
my
argument
reading
from
that
page,
page
24a
of
the
reply
brief,
where
the
fda
said
increased
litigation
over
use
codes
--
patent
listings
--
would
not
assure
faster
generic
entry
because
you
would
spend
years
and
years,
as
we
all
have,
litigating
these
very
issues.
so
the
congress
had
it
focused
on
this,
which
it
never
did.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
legislation
--
pages
of
legislative
history
about
use
codes.
had
it
focused
on
this,
it
would
never
have
gone
this
way
because
it
didn't
need
to.
and
when
it
did
have
the
broader
bill,
sa12,
it
failed.
