chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-844,
caraco
pharmaceutical
laboratories
v.
novo
nordisk.
mr.
hurst.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
an
apa
action
against
the
fda
for
relying
on
the
use
code?
couldn't
that
be
challenged
as
arbitrary
and
capricious?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
perry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what
page
have
you
got?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thanks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
alternative
is
that
the
fda
is
going
to
have
to
hire
an
awful
lot
of
patent
lawyers
to
review
the
use
codes
and
their
correspondence
to
the
actual
patents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
way
agency
action
gets
challenged
when
it's
substantive
action.
the
fda's
position,
the
united
states
position
is
that
this
is
purely
ministerial
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
still
not
following
it.
it's
not
listed
simply
because
the
number
is
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
brand
manufacturer
has
an
overwhelming
incentive
to
list
the
correct
patent,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
would
we
give
a
procedure
to
an
adversary
to
fix
the
number
when
the
brand
manufacturer
is
going
to
fix
it
as
soon
as
its
alerted
to
the
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hurst,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-844,
caraco
pharmaceutical
laboratories
versus
novo
nordisk.
