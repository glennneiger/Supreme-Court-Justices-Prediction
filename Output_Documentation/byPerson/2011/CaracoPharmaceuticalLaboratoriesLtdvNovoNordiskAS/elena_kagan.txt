justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hurst,
would
--
would
you
agree
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
this
situation?
as
i
understand
it,
it
wasn't
until
2003
that
the
fda
allowed
companies
to
write
their
own
use
codes,
and
that's
what
creates
this
problem.
so
would
you
agree
that
the
congress
that
passed
this
act
really
couldn't
have
had
this
situation
in
mind?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
are
suggesting
that--
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
horwich,
what
does
that
mean
exactly,
that
you
represent?
i
mean,
this
might
be
a
case
where
we
would
give
the
agency
deference,
except
the
agency's
name
doesn't
appear
on
the
brief.
so
should
we
give
you
any
deference?
justice
elena
kagan
and
it's
your
understanding
that
you
require
companies
to
state
the
scope
of
the
patent
in
the
use
code,
or
might
you
think
it's
perfectly
permissible
for
a
company
to
write
its
use
code
in
terms
of
indications?
justice
elena
kagan
so
that
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
was
not
the
regulation
issued
under
this
statutory
section?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
perry,
in
your
view,
patent
information
is
just
the
patent
number
and
the
expiration
date,
and
that's
all?
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
just
the
patent
number
and
the
expiration
date?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
would
anybody
have
created
this
counterclaim
to
fix
the
patent
number
and
the
expiration
date
when
that
can
be
done
by
way
of
the
defense
to
a
patent
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
so
your
argument,
mr.
perry,
is
not
just
that
the
word
"correct"
does
no
work.
your
argument
is
that
the
entire
provision
no
long
does
any
work?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
perry,
there
are
also
horribles
on
the
other
side,
of
course.
i
mean,
here's
--
there's
--
there's
the
statute,
and
it
has
three
provisions,
and
two
of
them
are
vague
and
one
of
them
works
against
you.
one
is
an
approved
method.
i
think,
you
know,
you
both
go
back
and
forth
about
it;
it
depends
on
context.
one
is
patent
information,
which,
you
know,
maybe
you
are
right,
and
maybe
mr.
hurst
is
right.
it's
not
really
quite
clear
what
it
means
to
be
under
subsection
(b)
or
(c).
the
third
is
correct.
you
basically
read
"correct"
out
of
the
statute.
so
at
best,
this
is
an
unclear
statute
from
your
point
of
view.
and
then
there
is
the
question
of
what
it
allows
you
to
do.
the
statute
read
your
way
essentially
allows
you
to
unilaterally
expand
your
patent
in
areas
in
which
it's
quite
clear
that
your
patent
ought
not
to
go
--
does
not
go
--
but
allows
you
to
do
that.
so
why
should
we
read
the
statute
so
that
it
effects
a
purpose
that
is
entirely
antagonistic
to
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
passing
this
statute,
given
that
the
statute
is
at
best
from
your
perspective
ambiguous?
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
but
here's
what
we
know
about
congress's
intent.
and
it
goes
back
to
the
mylan
suit.
what
we
know
about
congress's
intent
is
that
congress
wanted
to
give
a
generic
manufacturer
in
this
situation
a
remedy
when
there
was
a
completely
irrelevant
patent.
and
the
question
is
why
we
should
consider
this
to
be
any
different.
in
some
respects,
this
makes
--
this
is
worse
from
the
generic
manufacturer's
point
of
view
because
the
generic
manufacturer
doesn't
even
have
a
defense
in
an
infringement
suit--
justice
elena
kagan
--so
why
should
we
think
that
the
congress
that
really
cared
about
the
result
in
mylan
does
not
care
about
this?
justice
elena
kagan
in
this
case,
we
consider
the
scope
of
a
statute
authorizing
a
generic
drug
manufacturer
to
bring
a
counterclaim
against
a
branch
named
manufacturer
in
patent
litigation.
now,
to
understand
anything
about
the
statute,
you
need
to
know
a
little
bit
about
how
the
food
and
drug
administration,
the
fda,
approves
the
marketing
of
prescription
drugs,
both
brand
name
and
generic.
when
the
manufacturer
seeks
to
market
a
new
drug,
it
must
submit
an
application
to
the
fda,
showing
that
the
drug
is
safe
and
effective.
in
this
case,
a
company
called
novo
submitted
an
application
for
a
diabetes
drug
called
prandin,
which
is
the
brand
name
for
a
drug
compound
called
repaglinide
and
the
fda
approved
that
application
for
three
distinct
methods
of
using
the
drug.
once
a
new
drug
is
approved
in
this
way,
other
companies
may
seek
approval
from
the
fda
to
market
a
generic
version
which
will
be
cheaper
for
consumers,
but
the
fda
cannot
approve
a
generic
drug
if
it
would
infringe
the
brand
manufacturer's
patents.
so,
the
fda
requires
the
brand
manufacturer
to
provide
it
with
information
about
what
patents
it
holds
and
in
particular,
when
a
brand
manufacturer
holds
a
patent
on
a
particular
method
of
using
a
drug,
it
has
to
submit
a
description
of
that
patent,
which
is
known
and
this
is
important
to
determine
this
opinion
as
a
use
code.
now,
for
better
or
worse,
the
fda
doesn't
actually
check
whether
the
use
code
is
accurate.
the
agency
simply
assumes
that
it
is
and
makes
decisions
about
whether
to
approve
generic
drugs
on
that
basis.
okay
now,
when
a
generic
manufacturer
applies
to
the
fda,
it
checks
the
brand
manufacturer's
use
codes,
which
are
published
in
something
called
the
orange
book
and
then
it
tries
to
assure
the
fda
that
its
drug
will
not
infringe
the
brand's
patents.
you
can
do
this
in
a
few
ways,
one
of
which
is
by
what's
called
a
section
8
statement
which
certifies
that
the
generic
drug
will
be
marketed
only
from
methods
of
use
that
are
not
covered
by
the
brand
manufacturer's
patents.
here,
the
generic
manufacturer
is
a
company
called
caraco,
which
wants
to
market
a
generic
version
of
repaglinide.
caraco
thought
that
it
could
file
a
section
8
statement
because
the
fda
had
approved
repaglinide
for
three
methods
of
use,
but
novo,
the
brand
manufacturer
holds
a
patent
on
only
one
of
them
and
caraco
wanted
to
sell
its
drug,
its
generic
version,
only
for
the
other
two.
so,
caraco
filed
a
section
8
statement
in
the
hopes
of
getting
fda
approval,
but
here's
the
problem.
novo's
use
code,
its
description
of
its
own
patent
was
overbroad.
it
inaccurately
claimed
that
the
company
held
a
patent
on
all
three
approved
uses
of
repaglinide
and
because
that's
what
the
use
code
said,
and
as
i
told
you
before,
the
fda
doesn't
check
its
accuracy,
because
that's
what
the
use
code
said,
the
fda
could
not
approve
caraco's
application
based
on
a
section
8
statement.
the
only
thing
left
for
caraco
to
do
under
the
statute
was
to
file
a
different
kind
of
statement
which
the
law
--
which
the
law
treats
as
itself
an
act
of
patent
infringement
entitling
the
brand
manufacturer
to
sue
the
generic
company
and
that's
what
novo
did
and
now
finally,
we
get
to
the
question
in
this
case.
once
having
been
sued
by
novo,
could
caraco
bring
a
counterclaim
to
force
novo
to
correct
its
use
code?
that's
important
because
if
the
use
code
is
corrected,
caraco
could
re-file
its
section
8
statement.
the
fda
would
approve
it
and
then
caraco
could
market
its
generic
drug.
now,
there's
a
statute
that
specifies
when
a
generic
manufacturer
can
bring
a
counterclaim
against
a
brand
manufacturer
in
patent
litigation.
the
statute
allows
a
counterclaim
and
i'm
going
to
quote
now,
it's
kind
of
a
mouthful,
“when
the
generic
company
seeks
an
order,
requiring
the
brand
manufacturer
to
correct
or
delete
the
patent
information
submitted
by
the
brand
manufacturer
under
two
particular
statutory
provisions
on
the
ground
that
the
patents
does
not
claim
an
approved
method
of
using
the
drug.”
so,
what
we
had
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
decide
whether
this
statutory
language
entitles
a
generic
manufacturer
like
caraco
to
use
the
counterclaim
method
to
seek
correction
of
a
brand
manufacturer's
use
code.
we
hold
today
that
the
statutory
language
does
allow
such
a
counterclaim.
caraco
can
bring
a
claim
against
novo
to
force
novo
to
narrow
its
use
code
so
that
the
fda
can
approve
caraco's
generic
product.
our
opinion
focuses
on
two
phrases
in
the
statute.
first,
the
statute
says
that
a
generic
may
bring
a
counterclaim
when
the
patent
does
not
claim
an
approved
method
of
using
the
drug.
now,
novo
would
have
us
read
that
provision
to
require
the
generic
company
to
show
that
the
patent
does
not
claim
any
approved
method
of
using
the
drug
and
if
that's
--
if
that's
right,
then
novo
was
in
the
clear
because
its
patent
does
claim
one
approved
method
of
use.
by
contrast,
caraco
says,
“all
it
has
to
prove
is
that
the
patent
does
not
claim
a
particular
method
of
use,
the
one
for
which
it
seeks
to
market
its
product,”
and
if
that's
so,
caraco
wins,
because
novo's
patent
does
not
in
fact
claim
two
other
approved
methods
of
use,
the
methods
of
use
that
caraco
seeks
to
market
its
product
for.
we
think
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
question
as
a
grammatical
matter
and
the
opinion
has
a
bit
of
fun
with
it,
but
in
the
end,
we
say
that
the
context
of
this
statute
shows
that
caraco
is
right.
the
statute
is
concerned
not
with
whether
the
brand's
patent
claims
any
method
of
use,
but
with
whether
it
claims
the
method
for
which
the
generic
seeks
to
market
its
drug.
so
here,
we
think
the
phrase,
“not
an,”
means
not
a
particular
one,
rather
than
“not
any.”
second,
the
counterclaim
applies
only
to
patent
information
submitted
under
subsections
355
(b)
and
(c)
of
title
21.
novo
contends
that
use
codes
are
not
submitted
under
these
subsections,
but
instead,
under
fda
regulations.
but
we
reject
that
arguments
too
because
the
regulations
requiring
the
submission
of
use
codes
are
themselves
based
on
subsections
355
(b)
and
(c)
and
that's
it.
we
hold
that
caraco
may
use
the
counterclaim
to
challenge
novo's
use
code
and
we
reverse
the
federal
circuit's
contrary
judgment.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
