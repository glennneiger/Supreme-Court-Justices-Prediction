justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
the
context
here,
one
would
expect
it
to
say,
if
it
meant
what
you
say
it
meant,
a
--
did
not
claim
a
use
asserted
by
the
generic.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
just
"did
not
claim
a
use"
and
we
have
to
fill
in,
that
is
"the
use
asserted
by
the
generic.
"
that's
a
strange
thing
to
fill
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
elegance.
it's
a
matter
of
how
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
--
to
be
framed
if
it
meant
what
you
--
what
you
say
it
means.
it's
--
so
easy
to
say
that,
does
not
--
claim
the
use
asserted
by
the
generic.
my
goodness,
and
that's
what
you
say
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
much,
but
it's
something.
[laughter]
and
--
and
the
way
you
are
talking,
you
seem
to
assume
that
all
the
problems
in
the
world
have
to
be
addressed
by
this
statute.
would
you
have
no
remedy
by
--
by
suing
the
fcc
for
accepting
uses
that
--
that
it
should
not
have
accepted?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
if
--
but
if
you
have
alternative
remedies,
i
am
not
terribly
shocked
by
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
remedy
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
--
it's
--
it's
--
the
issue
is
not
whether
congress
enacted
it
only
for
that.
the
issue
is
whether
congress
enacted
it
for
that
in
addition
to
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
a
very
small
detail,
you
know
--
"correct".
you
are
saying
this
one
word,
"correct",
in
this
immense
bill
with
all
sorts
of
cause
of
actions
and
other
provisions
here
and
there;
that
one
word
has
this,
this
minimal
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
conceivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
us
of
a
cite
of
that,
please?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
do
it
now.
just
file
it
with
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
eat
your
time
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
cited
in
principal
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
don't
waste
your
time.
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
the
problem
of
improper
listing?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
it
were,
as
i
believe
the
government
acknowledged,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
we
owe
deference
to
the
fda.
the
issue
is
whether
a
lawsuit
can
be
brought
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
--
we
don't
decide
whether
we
have
authority
to
decide
cases
on
the
basis
of
what
the
agency
thinks.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
you
say
about
the
--
the
section
cited
by
--
by
your
colleague?
