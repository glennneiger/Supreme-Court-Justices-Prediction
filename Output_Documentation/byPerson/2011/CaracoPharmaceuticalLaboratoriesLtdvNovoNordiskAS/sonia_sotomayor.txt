--counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
finish
answering.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
will
wait
for
your
rebuttal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
said
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--except,
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--except
the
fda
tells
parties
not
to
rely
on
the
orange
code.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
tells
them
what
controls
is
the
patent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--just
on
a
practical
basis.
i
understand
that
the
petitioner
has
filed
an
amended
label
in
2010.
i
presume
that
that
amended
label
copies
the
current
label
with
the
exception
of
substituting
the
manufacturer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
let's
assume
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--now,
it
claims
that
when
the
paragraph
iv
--
the
paragraph
iv
action
is
started
and
it's
sued
for
infringement,
that
it's
automatically
going
to
lose--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
explain
to
me
--
could
you
explain
to
me
why?
is
merely
the
use
of
a
label
that's
identical
infringement
or
is
it
an
infringement
of
the
underlying
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
so
tell
us
how
a
court
gets
out
of
the
quandary
of
there
being
a
claim
that
is
stipulated
to
--
i've
infringed
--
and
then
how
does
it
deal
with
the
counterclaim?
now,
the
district
court
just
ignored
the
act
of
infringement
below
and
went
straight
to
the
counterclaim.
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
you
get
out
of
the
quandary
that
this
creates
for
the
courts
and
the
parties.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
that
caraco
puts
in
a
label
like
the
one
it
wants
to
use
under
claim
4.
will
the
fda
just
kick
it
out?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
will
not
even
ask
for
a
response
from
novo?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
is
that
before
--
without
an
infringement
action
by
novo?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
tell
me
the
fda
doesn't
want
to
get
involved
in
construing
the
patent,
why
is
it
kicking
out
the
claim
for,
claim
for,
claim
until
novo
does
a
suit
on
whether
or
not
the
generic
is
infringing
or
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
let
that
issue
be
decided
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
odds
would
you
put--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
odds
would
you
put
as
a
betting
lawyer
on
them
winning
a
challenge
to
the
fda
policy
decisions
of
what
its
capable
of
doing
and
not
doing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
let's
assume,
because
i
now
take
from
your
earlier
conversation
with
justice
breyer
that
you're
saying
the
use
code
here
is
absolutely
right,
because
the
only
use
that
we
claimed
was
the
combination
use
of
the
drug,
your
drug
with
the
metformin.
but
the
only
thing
that
is
wrong
here
is
the
indication
that
the
fda
has
required.
so
that's
not
even
wrong
because
you
have
no
choice
about
that;
is
that
correct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
this
means
practically
i
believe
is
that
when
your
patent
expires
no
generic
can
come
in
with
a
use
that's
different
than
yours
because
they're
going
to
be
boxed
out
by
this
indication,
this
overbroad
indication.
do
you
actually
i
thought
think
that
that's
what
congress
intended?
i
thought
with
claim
4
and
section
viii
that
what
congress
intended
was
to
ensure
that
drugs
got
onto
the
market
as
quickly
as
possible.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
parade
of
horribles
that
you
imagine
if
we
were
to
read
the
counterclaim
provision
in
the
way
your
adversary
is
promoting
and
the
government
is
promoting?
what
--
what,
presumably
in
the
normal
case
and
the
one
that
the
regulations
appear
to
expect
is
that
the
use
code,
the
indication
code,
everything
is
going
to
match
the
patent.
so
in
that
situation,
the
counterclaim
would
have
no
work
to
do.
so
what
is
the
parade
of
horribles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
asking
you
to
accept
that
we
are
to
--
as
an
assumption
only,
don't
--
it's
not
intended
to
be
a
--
a
ruling
--
to
assume
that
we
read
the
counterclaim
in
the
way
your
adversaries
want
us
to.
what's
the
parade
of
horribles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
going
back
to
the
question
that
i
had.
and
a
more
practical
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
i
read
the
record,
in
april
of
'08,
the
<fda>
[=
fda]
rejected
your
section
viii
application.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right?
and
it
asked
you
to
submit
an
amended
code.
your
brief
says
we
did
it
in
september,
is
it
anywhere
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
you
--
you
submitted
what
the
fda
requested
for
your
claim
4,
the
amended
label?
