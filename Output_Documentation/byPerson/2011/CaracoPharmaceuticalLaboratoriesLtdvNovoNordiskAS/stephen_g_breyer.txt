justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
bring
you
back
for
a
minute,
please,
to
the
statute,
and
if
you
--
it's
in
page
3
of
the
blue
brief.
and
in
just
reading
it,
i
might
be
missing
something
which
you
will
point
out
to
me,
i'm
sure.
but
if
you
get
the
statute
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
says,
as
i
--
if
you've
got
it
there,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says,
anda
holder>
["],
now
that's
--
that's
novo,
"holder
of
the
approval
--
the
approval
holder
for
the
drug,
a.
"
--i'm
skipping
words
--
"a
use
of
which
is
claimed
by
the
patent.
"
and
that's
what
you
are
doing
--
what's
that
use
was,
and
i
look
at
page
12
and
the
use
is
"a
method
for
improving
glycemic
in
adults
with
type
2
diabetes
mellites.
"
so
that's
the
use
that
you're
--
that's
the
use
that's
claimed
by
the
patent.
"if
you
bring
a
patent
infringement
action
against
the
anda
applicant.
"
that's
them,
"the
anda
applicant
may
assert
a
counterclaim,
which
they
want
to
do,
seeking
an
order
requiring
the
holder
to
correct
the
patent
information
on
the
ground
that
the
patent
does
not
claim
an
approved
method
of
using
the
drug.
"
so
i
look
at
that
with
those
words
--
i've
skipped
words.
i
look
at
those
words
and
i
say
that's
what
they
are
saying.
they
are
saying
the
use
that
--
that
it
--
that
your
patent
does
not
cover
a
portion
of
the
set
of
things
described
by
your
use.
and
therefore
they
would
like
to
correct
the
description
so
that
the
description
no
longer
covers
something
that
you
do
not
have
--
a
use
that
you
do
not
have
a
patent
on.
now
that
would
seem
to
me
to
fit
within
those
literal
words.
and
of
course
the
purpose
is
what
we
have
been
arguing
about.
but
just
looking
at
the
literal
words,
why
doesn't
it
fit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
the
--
this
--
a
method
for
improving
glycemic
control
in
adults
with
type
ii
diabetes
mellites
is
not
the
patent
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
are
saying
it
is
patent
information?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do.
maybe
your
colleague
can
find
it
for
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
i
know
that
argument,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
need
that
argument.
if
you're
right
that
the
patent
information
in
this
particular
provision
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
or
at
least
does
not
cover
the
words
about
diabetes
i
just
read,
well,
then
i
guess
this
section
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
because
those
are
the
words
they
want
corrected,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
what
it
also
says
is
this,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
go
back
to
this
literal
statutory
argument.
we
took
the
words,
because
this
is
what
you
can
correct.
what
you
can
correct,
the
statute
says,
is
you
can
correct
"patent
information
submitted
by
the
holder
under
subsection
(b)
or
(c).
"
so
we
look
at
(b),
and
what
(b)
says
is
(b)
tells
us
that
you
are
supposed
to
submit
in
respect
to
where
you
claim
the
use
of
a
drug
the
patent
number
and
the
expiration
date.
so,
so
far
that
seems
to
support
you.
but
then
we
look
at
the
regulations
which
the
fda
promulgated,
i
take
it
promulgated
in
respect
to
(b)
and
(c),
particularly
the
sentence
i
read,
or
maybe
some
similar
sentence,
and
it
tells
you
that
you
have
to
provide
the
description
of
the
patented
method
of
use
as
required
for
publication.
so
now
i
go
back
and
look
at
what
you
did
provide.
and
what
you
did
provide
was
you
provided
--
you
said
that
what
we
do,
we
have
a
method
for
improving
glycemic
control
in
adults
with
type
ii
diabetes
mellitus.
that
seems
to
fit
directly
under
(iii)
of
the
fda's
requirement
and
that
fda
requirement
was
an
expansion
of
(b)
and
therefore
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
when
they
say
"correct",
"correct
the
patent
information",
it
includes
the
sentence
that
you
put
there
that
they
would
like
to
see
corrected.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
government
--
now,
the
government,
which
is
representing
all
the
government
agencies,
whether
the
fda
signs
it
or
not,
tells
us
that
that
language,
that
(b)
and
(c)
language
about
patent
information
as
interpreted
by
the
regs
does
cover
this
stuff.
this
is
about
the
most
technical
statute
i
ever
read--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
--
when
i'm
talking
about
patent
information
among
(b)
and
(c),
we
have
the
government
telling
us
that
that
covers
this,
and
why
don't
i
just
stop
right
there
and
say
thank
goodness
i
am
out
of
this
case
--
and
i'm
not
out
of
it--
