when
the
fda
was
writing
the
codes,
was
it
writing
about
the
scope
of
the
patent?
or
was
it
writing
about
labeling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
can
ask
the
government,
but
why
did
it
think
that
it
lacked
the
expertise,
because
it
didn't
want
to
opine
under
the
patent
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
suffice
in
the
description
just
to
give
a
cross-reference
to
the
patent,
to
say
the
use
of
this
drug
as
described
in
patent
claim
number
43?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
more
question
on
how
this
works.
why
does
the
fda
rely
on
use
codes
in
the
orange
book
to
make
the
carve-outs
if
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
code?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
do
you
describe
what
the
fda
does?
what's
your
third?
