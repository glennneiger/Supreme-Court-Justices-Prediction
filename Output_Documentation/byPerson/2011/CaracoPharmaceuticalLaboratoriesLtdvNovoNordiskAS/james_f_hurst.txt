mr.
james
f.
hurst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
1984,
whenever
an
--
a
drug
has
multiple
fda-approved
uses,
there
has
been
a
statutory
path
for
generic
drugs
to
reach
the
market
if
there
are
specific
uses
not
covered
by
a
patent.
here,
there
is
no
dispute
that
novo's
patent
does
not
claim
the
use
of
repaglinide
when
used
alone,
and
that
is
"an
approved
method"
of
using
the
drug.
even
though
that
matches
the
statutory
language
exactly,
novo
is
arguing
that
in
this
case,
our
counterclaim
to
correct
their
blocking
use
code
is
thwarted
by
the
fact
that
their
patent
does
claim
a
different
approved
use--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--that
patent
has
long
expired,
and
they
also
had
a
patent
using
--
for
the
use
of
the
drug
to
treat
diabetes
through
any
method,
and
that
patent
has
long
expired.
the
only
patent
that's
left
that
novo
has
is
specifically
limited
to
the
use
of
repaglinide
in
combination
with
metformin
to
treat
diabetes.
my
client,
caraco,
is
attempting
to
get
on
the
market
for
admittedly
non-infringing
uses,
which
occupy
about
70
percent
of
the
marketplace
out
there.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
believe
that
--
that
--
if
--
it
depends
on
the
context
of
the
sentence,
but
i
think
that
would
be
a
correct
statement
if
i
understand
the
way
you
are
asking
the
question.
you
are
asking
the
question
in
a
way
that
suggests
to
me
by
context,
you're
asking
whether
i
cite
any
supreme
court
precedent.
but
the
context
here
is
a
little
bit
different,
because
the
context
here
in
the
counterclaim
is
a
situation
where
drugs
routinely
have
multiple
and
different
distinct
uses.
and
in
that
context--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--that's
true,
that's
true.
but
when
a
judge
--
when
a
judge
says
to
me
that,
you
know,
you
are
going
to
lose
this
case
because
you
didn't
cite
an
applicable
precedent,
i
am
going
to
hear
that
to
mean
i
didn't
cite
a
specific
particular
case.
there
are
many
ways
to
use
the
word
"an"
after
the
word
"not"
where
it
clearly
does
not
mean
"any".
for
instance:
"the
prosecutor
failed
to
get
a
conviction
because
she
did
not
prove
an
element
of
the
offense.
"
"i
got
lost
on
my
way
to
the
party
because
i
failed
to
make
a
turn.
"
"my
cake
fell
because
i
did
not
include
an
ingredient.
"
so
the
context
speaks
volumes
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
"an"
means
"any"
in
any
particular
context.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
justice
scalia
--
you're--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--justice
scalia,
i
am
not
quibbling
with
the
fact
that
this
could
--
the
statute
could
have
been
written
more
elegantly.
my
guess
is
that
almost
every
statute
this
court
is
asked
to
construe,
there
are
different
ways
that
it
could
have
been
written
to
resolve
the
issue
in
question.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
if
--
and
look
at
the
context.
the
statute
does
not
ask
the
brand
company
to
identify
an
approved
use
that
the
patent
does
claim.
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
anda
applicant
to
come
into
court,
file
a
counterclaim,
and
identify
an
approved
use
that
the
patent
does
not
claim.
we've
carried
that
burden
twice
over,
there
are
two
approved
uses
that
the
patent
does
not
claim.
context--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--well,
i
mean
--
the
truth
is
the
patent
--
yes
--
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
but
i
would
have
no
reason
to
go
into
court
to
fix
a
use
code
that
is
not
blocking
me.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
believe
it
does,
because
it
the
deletion
talks
about
--
there's
two
remedies:
remedy
and
the
correction
remedy.
as
we
read
the
statute,
we
preserve
distinct
roles
for
the
correction
remedy
and
the
deletion
remedy.
as
novo
reads
this
statute,
they
all
but
acknowledge
that
they
are
writing
the
word
"correct"
out
of
the
statute,
because
there
is
no
meaningful
role
for
the
correction
remedy
as
novo
is
reading
this
statute.
they
call
the
correction
remedy
a
--
a
relic
of
a
failed
bill.
and
in
fact,
they
haven't
identified
any
meaningful
role
for
the
word
"correct"
in
the
statute
as
they
read
this
statute.
remember,
what
they
say
is
there
is
two
pieces
of
information
that
qualify
as
patent
information:
expiration
dates
and
patent
numbers.
nothing
else.
the
correction
remedy
can
never
reach
an
expiration
date
under
any
circumstances.
i
haven't
heard
novo
to
argue
otherwise.
what
they're
saying
is
if
a
patent
is
correctly
listed
in
the
orange
book,
this
counterclaim
is
unavailable.
so
what
does
that
mean?
if
the
brand
company
incorrectly
lists
the
expiration
date
for
a
properly
listed
patent
as
2150,
this
counterclaim
is
not
available
to
correct
the
expiration
date.
so
that
leaves
only
one
single
piece
of
information
that
could
possibly
be
addressed
by
the
correction
remedy.
and
what
does
novo
say?
patent
numbers:
they
say
well,
the
correction
remedy
could
be
available
for
fixing
typos
in
a
patent.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
--
whether
i
do
have
alternative
remedies
doesn't
answer
the
question
about
whether
i
have
a
remedy
in
--
for
this
particular
counterclaim.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
don't
have
any
good
remedies
under
this
statute.
i
could
not,
justice
scalia,
sue
the
fda
for
accepting
the
use
code,
at
least
based
on
existing
law,
because
the
fda's
position
is
that
their
role
with
respect
to
patents
is
purely
ministerial.
that
has
been
upheld
for
about
a
decade
now,
including
multiple
courts
of
appeals,
the
federal
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit.
so
my
ability
to
sue
the
fda
for
accepting
novo's
incorrect
use
code
is
not
really
a
true
alternative
remedy.
the
remedy
that
congress
gave
me,
that
i
--
that
we
think
congress
gave
us,
is
an
enormously
efficient
remedy.
we
filed
our
counterclaim
and
within
3-1/2
months
we
got
an
injunction
asking
novo
to
correct
its
use
code.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
could
not.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
because
there's
two
paths
that
are
available
under
the
fda
to
get
--
for
a
generic
to
get
approval.
one
is
section
(viii),
and
if
i
proceed
under
section
(viii)
i
can
carve
out
the
patented
use
from
my
label.
if
--
and
your
honor's
question
assumed
i
am
i
went
through
the
other
route,
paragraph
iv.
i
am
not
--
fda
does
not
allow
you
to
carve
out
any
portion
of
your
label
if
you
are
proceeding
under
paragraph
iv.
so
in
the
circumstance
that
you
just
described,
i
would
--
i
would
be
infringing
under
paragraph
iv
and
the
only
way
for
me
to
get
on
the
market
is
to
invalidate
the
patent.
now,
think
about
what
that
means.
novo
is
forcing
us,
essentially,
to
infringe.
we
don't
want
to
infringe.
we
are
trying
to
carve
out
our
label
so
that
we
can
proceed
under
section
(viii).
they
have
blocked
our
ability
to
use
section
(viii),
so
they've
forced
us
into
paragraph
iv,
forced
us
to
infringe.
and
what
happens
if
we
fail
to
invalidate
the
patent?
we
are
kept
off
the
market
until
2018
for
admittedly
noninfringing
uses
of
the
drug.
there
are
two
admittedly
noninfringing
uses
of
the
drug.
that's
where
we
want
--
that's
what
we
want
to
use
to
get
to
the
market.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
i
wouldn't
agree,
because
look
at
the
timing.
the
fda
issued
the
regulation
entitled
2003.
congress
enacted
this
counterclaim
using
the
same
language
in
december
of
2003.
the
submission
of
patent
information
regulation
by
the
fda
with
respect
to
method-of-use
patents,
and
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
is
all
about
ensuring
that
the
use
code
itself
is
accurate
and
correct
and
matches
up
with
the
patent.
so
i
think
this
is
something
that
congress
clearly
had
in
mind,
because
you
have
to
assume
that
they
knew
about
the
regulation
enacted
by
the
agency
that
was
administering
this
statute,
issued
just
months
before
they
enacted
the
counterclaim
using
the
same
--
the
same--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
incorrect;
your
timing
is
incorrect.
prior
to
june
of
2003
the
fda
was
authoring
the
use
codes
based
on
information
from
the
brand
companies,
but
after
june
2003
the
brand
companies
were
authoring
the
use
codes
and
the
statute
was
enacted
after
june
of
2003.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
it
was
writing
about
the
scope
of
the
patent.
the
use
codes
have
always
been
about
the
scope
of
the
method-of-use
patent;
it
has
never
been
about
anything
other
than
the
scope
of
the
method-of-use
patents.
the
only--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--i
think
the
short
answer
is
yes;
the
fda
has
always
done
their
very
best
to
not
get
anywhere
near
the
patents.
they
don't
do
patents,
essentially,
and
so
they
decided
--
and
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
notice
and
rule
--
i'm
sorry,
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
about
this,
and
eventually
they
decided
to
make
--
to
have
the
brands
submit
the
use
code.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
it
--
it
would
not
be
sufficient,
because
the
way
--
the
whole
purpose
of
the
use
code
is
to
administer
section
(viii).
so
what
the
fda
does
is
they
take
the
use
code,
and
they
match
it
up
with
the
label,
and
then
the
generic
gets
to
carve
out
whatever
the
brand
company
says
is
patented
via
the
use
code.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
but
if
i
could
get
back
to
a
question,
justice
scalia,
that
you
asked
about
the
--
whether
correcting
typos
in
patent
numbers
is
a
real
role
for
the
correction
remedy.
i
would
submit
it
is
not.
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
novo
is
asking
you
to
eliminate
the
correction
remedy
from
this
statute,
and
here's
why.
think
about
what
they
are
saying.
novo
is
saying
that
the
brand
company
decides
to
put
the
patent
in
the
orange
book,
but
somebody
transposes
two
numbers.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
mistake
that's
made.
what
does
that
mean
in
concrete
terms?
well,
if
you
transpose
the
two
numbers,
the
odds
are
astronomically
high
that
the
brand
company
is
citing
a
patent
that
they
don't
own
and
that
certainly
doesn't
relate
to
the
drug
in
question.
it
might
relate
to
tire
treads;
who
knows?
but
you
do
not
--
congress
did
not
enact
a
federal
cause
of
action
to
address
typos
in
patents.
the
brand
company
has
every
incentive
in
the
world
--
and
the
generic
company
has
no
incentive
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
fix
that.
but
the
brand
company
has
every
incentive
in
the
world
to
ensure
that
they
don't
make
such
mistakes,
because
there
is
a
statutory
benefit
to
properly
listing
patents.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
but--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--you
have--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--you
have
to
give
it
some
meaning.
you
have
to
give
it
some
practical
meaning.
and
right
now
--
and
it's
only
--
the
counterclaim
has
only
two
remedies,
so
novo
is
arguing
that
the
first
of
the
two
remedies
is
practically
nonexistent.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
there
is
no
role
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
there
is
no
role
whatsoever.
it
is
surplusage
by
any
definition
to
--
to
say
that
--
"correct"
is
surplusage
by
any
meaningful
definition.
if
you
even
put
a
dose
of
realism
to
this,
"correct"
has
no
role
under
novo's
reading,
while
we
preserve
a
distinct
role
for
both
the
correction
and
the
deletion
remedy.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
thank
you.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
sotomayor.
mr.
james
f.
hurst
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
start
by
--
by
asking
the
court
if
i
can
to
turn
to
the
joint
appendix,
second
volume,
484.
and
i
want
to
address
two
issues:
the
argument
that
the
use
code
is
disconnected
from
the
patent
itself,
and
it
--
it
may
relate
to
the
indication
regardless
of
what
the
patent
says;
and
whether
or
not
the
information
is
being
submitted
under
subsection
(b)
and
(c).
if
you
are
at
484,
this
form
went
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
before
the
enactment
of
the
counterclaim.
the
title,
314.53,
entitled
"submission
of
patent
information".
now
look
at
right
below
those
two
boxes.
what
does
it
say
--
how
does
it
say
the
information
is
being
submitted?
this
is
a
form
novo
signed.
"the
following
is
provided
in
accordance
with
section
505(b).
"
"that's
355(b)
and
(c)
of
the
federal
food
and
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
"
moreover,
when
the
fda
issued
this
patent
submission
regulation
in
its
final
rule,
it
cited
505
as
its
legal
authority.
that's
at
28j
of
the
blue
book.
it
cited
--
and
it
specifically
called
out
subsections
(b)
and
(c).
so
this
is
a
regulation
that
was
enacted
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
counterclaim.
and
now--
mr.
james
f.
hurst
--we
address
--
he's
citing
something
the
fda
said
in
2007.
and
if
you
actually
read
it,
we
cited
it
--
we
addressed
this
in
our
brief.
it
actually
says
our
--
our
legal
authority
for
doing
this
was
explained
fully
in
2003.
and
in
2003,
the
fda
cites
505.
can
i
turn
you
quickly
to
487
now.
this
addresses
quite
specifically
this
notion
that
the
indication
can
be
used
even
if
it's
disconnected
from
the
patent.
4.2(b).
remember
what
the
regulation
says,
and
justice
breyer
read
this
before.
it's
at
127a
of
the
appendix.
but
the
regulation
says
that
the
brand
is
required
to
"the
description
of
the
patented
method
of
use
as
required
for
publication.
"
they
are
supposed
to
provide
that
information.
and
look
what
the
actual
instruction
says.
it
could
not
be
more
clear
4.2(b),
bottom
right
side.
"the
answer
to
this
question"
--
this
is
where
the
brand
supplies
the
use
code
--
"the
answer
to
this
question
will
be
what
fda
uses
to
create
a
use
code
for
orange
book
publication.
"
"the
use
code
designates
a
method
of
use
patent
that
claims
the
approved
indication
for
use.
"
it
depends
on
what
the
patent
claims
"of
a
drug
product".
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
why
you
need
to
do
that.
each
approved
use
claimed
by
the
patent
should
be
separately
identified
in
this
section
and
contain
"adequate
information"
--
this
refers
to
section
viii
--
"adequate
information
to
assist
505(b)(2)
and
anda
applicants.
"
--that's
us
--
"in
determining
whether
a
listed
method
of
use
patent
claims
a
use
for
which
the
anda
applicant
is
not
seeking.
"
--that
is
precisely
the
situation
we
were
facing.
we
have
offered
a
construction
of
this
statute
that
is
fully
consistent
with
its
text,
its
structure
and
its
purpose.
and
it
really
is
the
only
reading
of
the
statute
that
carries
out
congressional
intent
in
terms
of
trying
to
prevent
situations
where
incorrect
patent
information
is
unfairly
delaying
generic
competition.
up
to
this
point
right
now,
novo
has
still
failed
to
identify
any
reason
why
anybody
in
congress
would
want
the
system
to
work
