mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
pick
up
with
justice
kennedy's
question
about
fda
and
writing
use
codes.
the
first
thing
i'd
point
out
is
that
before
2003,
although
fda
wrote
the
actual
text
that
went
in
the
orange
book,
it
was
relying
on
information
submitted
on
a
sort
of
free-form
declaration
by
the
--
by
the
brand.
so
the
brand
was
still
kind
of
--
excuse
me
--
calling
the
shots
in
that
--
in
that
respect.
but
the
--
but
the
more
important
point
is
that
the
fda
doesn't
have
the
resources
or
expertise
or
--
to
engage
in
the
substantive
patent
evaluations
that,
that
would
be
required
under
a
theory
where
you
would
go
sue
the
fda
if
you
had
a
problem
with
this.
but
more
to
the
point--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--we
--
yes.
we
represent
the
united
states
here,
and
so
we
--
we
speak
--
we
speak
for
fda
and
the
other
agencies
of
the
government
who
are
very
concerned
here
about
the
competition
law
effects
of
this.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
in
some
ways
the
bigger
story
here.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
names
on
the
brief
i
think
should
not
be
a
guide
to
the
deference
question.
but
we
are
not
really
claiming
deference
in
the
sense
--
because
what
we
are
construing
here,
what
the
court
is
construing
here,
is
the
counterclaim
provision,
which
is
a
federal
cause
of
action.
so
the
adams
fruit
decision
of
this
court
would
say
that
agencies
don't
get
deference
in
defining
the
terms
of
a
federal
cause
of
action.
we
do
think
that
--
we
do
think
that
it's
important
to
recognize
that
congress
and
the
agency
were
engaged
in
a
dialogue
in
2003.
and
although
i
wouldn't
label
that
deference,
i
would
--
i
would
probably
characterize
it
more
accurately
as
congress
building
upon
what
fda
had
done
in
constructing
its
patent
information
regulation
and
congress
saying,
we
need
a
means
to
--
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
system
fda
has
set
up.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
statute
--
well,
let
me
start
with
the
basic
that
the
statute
envisions
that
there
will
be
carve-outs.
that's
the
whole
principle
behind
section
8.
and
so
fda
says,
well,
we
need
to
know
when
a
generic
has
made
a
valid
carve-out.
and
fda
says,
and
fda
goes
through
this
in
the
2003
rulemaking
--
if
you
read
through
the
preamble
there
is
more
detail.
but
the
short
of
it
is
fda
has
three
choices.
it
could
rely
on
the
generics
to
say
that
they've
carved
out,
but
that
doesn't
really
work
because
the
generics
could
say
something
and
then
get
on
the
market
when
they
hadn't
proper
carved
out
and
that
kind
of
defeats
the
whole
point
of
hatch-waxman's
principle
of
getting
patent
issues
resolved
before
regulatory
approval.
fda
could,
as
a
second
alternative,
try
to
evaluate
patents
itself.
but
nowhere
else
in
the
statute
is
fda
given
any
role
in
the
substantive
evaluation
of
patents,
and
with
good
reasons.
this
court
has
said
in
its
markman
decision
that
claim
construction
of
patents
is
a
question
of
law.
the
actors
in
our
system
that
decide
what
patents
mean
are
courts
and
ultimately
this
court;
it's
not
fda.
so
the
third
choice--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
the
problem,
justice
alito,
is
that
from
fda's
point
of
view
it's
a
very
slippery
slope,
because
as
soon
as
fda
starts
undertaking
criticism
of
a
use
code
its
effective
--
the
only
basis
for
criticizing
it
is
looking
at
the
patent.
now,
this
may
be
a
very
easy
case,
but
the
court
shouldn't
be
fooled
that
all
cases
are
going
to
be
easy.
and
if
fda
here
were
to
go
in
and
said,
well,
this
doesn't
look
like
it's
the
same
as
the
claim
of
the
patents,
in
the
next
case,
where
it's
a
more
difficult
question,
where
there
may
be
some
very
good
faith
dispute
between
the
parties
about
the
very
meaning
of
the
patent,
fda
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other,
and
it's
going
to
get
sued.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
only
posture
in
which
a
court
would
actually
look
at
a
use
code
and
evaluate
it
is
under
the
counterclaim.
the
court
would
not
be
looking
at
a
use
code
under
traditional
paragraph
iv
litigation,
and
so
the
author
of
the
majority
opinion
below
was
kind
of
mistaken
in
that
regard.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
challenge
would
fail
because
<fda>
[=
fda]
has
made
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute,
that
its
role
its
role
is
ministerial,
it
does
not
engage
in
substantive
evaluation
of
patents
because
the
statute
doesn't
envision
that.
so
fda
would
win
that
suit.
on
the
other
hand,
if
--
going
back
to
my
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
if
we
are
talking
about
kind
of
a
second
scenario
where
fda
does
engage
in
substantive
patent
review,
yes,
fda
could
get
sued.
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
fda
is
going
to
get
sued
in
an
apa
suit,
the
real
parties
in
interest
are
going
to
be
the
generic
and
the
brand,
fda
is
not
going
to
be
owed
any
deference
because
it's
going
to
turn
on
a
matter
of
claim
construction,
which
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
so
what
fda
does
do
is
it
accepts
the
submission
from
the
brand
describing
its
--
describing
its
use
code.
and
fda
says
in
its
2003
rulemaking:
we
are
trying
to
do
the
best
we
can
through
the
administrative
process
to
get
good
information
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it's
certainly
possible
in
a
particular
case
that
the
indications
would
be
appropriate.
this
is
--
what
we
are
asking
for
in
the
use
code
is
something
that's
good
enough
to
do
the
job
that
the
use
code
is
intended
for,
which
is
to
inform
fda--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--what
needs
to
be
carved
out.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
that
is
true
that
fda
said
that
the
parties
should
look
at
the
patent.
but
what
fda
said
in
its
2003
rulemaking
is
that
it
would
rely
on
the
use
code.
let
me
also
point--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
label
--
i
can't
speak
to
what
the
labeling
in
the
application
is
right
now,
because
it's
confidential.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
but
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it's
the
same,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
that's
right,
and
in
fact--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--in
fact,
caraco
has
stipulated
to
that.
that's
at
joint
appendix
177,
because
it
includes
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it
would
be
inducement
of
infringement
to
sell
a
product
with
labeling
that
suggests
that
the
product
be
used
for
a
patented
method
of
use.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
counterclaim
is
designed
precisely
to
get
out
of
the
quandary,
because
what
it
says
is
the
paragraph
iv
litigation
here,
the
choice
between
infringement
and
noninfringement,
is
a
false
choice,
because
if
the
counterclaim
prevails
and
the
use
code
changes
the
paragraph
iv
litigation
is
going
to
go
away
because
caraco
is
going
to
want
to
go
proceed
through
section
(viii).
it's
going
to
be
able
to
carve
out
and
get
approval
that
way
without
a
judgment
in
the
paragraph
iv
litigation.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
it's
not
--
it's
not
permissible.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
fda
will
not
permit
--
does
not
permit
--
will
not
approve
the
application
where
theirs
is
carve-out
combined
with
section
--
with
paragraph
iv.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i'm
not
sure
of
the
timing.
of
course,
it's
possible.
the
paragraph
iv
litigation
is
somewhat
in
the
control
of
the
parties,
so
it's
not
as
if
fda
sends
out
the
notices
that
could
trigger
the
litigation.
but
there
might
not
be
--
there
might
not
be--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--from
fda's
point
of
view,
it's
not
a
sufficient
application
if
there's
carveout
labeling
presented
with
a
paragraph
iv
certification.
and
i'd
also
say
this.
to
take
a
step
back,
the
fact
that
there
might
be
conceivably
alternative
remedies
under
some
other
construction
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
shouldn't
make
you
think
the
counterclaim
isn't
available
here.
after
all,
the
situation
that
novo
agrees--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--thank
you.
--the
situation
novo
agrees
is
covered
by
the
counterclaim,
where
the
patent
doesn't
belong
in
the
orange
book
at
all,
is
one
that
can
be
remedied
at
some
expense
and
delay
through
paragraph
iv
litigation
by
proving
noninfringement
if
the
patent's
irrelevant.
