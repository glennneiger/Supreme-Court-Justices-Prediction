justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
i
said
your
brief
does
not
cite
a
supreme
court
decision.
would
that
be
a
correct
statement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
have
hundreds
and
hundreds,
probably
thousands
of
opinions,
and
you
didn't
cite
--
there
were
many
of
them
that
you
didn't
cite.
you
cited
quite
a
few,
but
you
didn't
cite
all
of
them.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
satisfy
the
--
the
ground
for
seeking
deletion
or
correction
was
satisfied
even
before
novo
wrote
the
new
use
code
that
you
claim
is
overly
broad.
when
the
use
code
said
simply
the
use
of
repaglinide
with
metformin,
the
--
the
ground
for
seeking
deletion
or
correction
was
satisfied,
wasn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
that's
another
--
so
there
are
two
oddities
in
the
way
you
read
the
statute.
now,
maybe
congress
just
did
a
bad
job
of
drafting.
but
the
first
is
the
one
we
were
discussing
before,
and
that's
the
second
one,
that
--
your
--
your
beef
really
is
not
that
the
patent
does
not
include
every
use.
your
beef
is
that
the
source
--
the
use
code
is
too
broad,
and
yet
that
is
not
the
ground
that
the
statute
sets
out
for
seeking
deletion
or
correction.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
you
didn't
file
the
--
suppose
the
counterclaim
provision
wasn't
available,
and
novo
--
you
filed
a
paragraph
iv
certification
and
novo
sues
you
for
infringement.
could
you
not
defend
the
infringement
action
on
the
ground
that
your
use
of
the
--
of
the
drug
was
not
in
--
did
not
infringe
their
patent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
--
why
is
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
patent
holder
--
if
the
patent
holder
writes
a
use
code
that
is
ridiculously,
totally,
unreasonably
broad,
is
there
anything
that
fda
can
do
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
after
--
what
about
after
there
has
been
litigation
and
a
court
has
decided
that
a
use
code
that
was
written
in
a
particular
case
was
totally
unreasonable?
does
that
mean
that
the
writing
of
that
was
in
violation
of
some
provision
of
the
food
and
drug
act
or
fda
regulations
and
that
there
would
be
some
sanction
against
the
company
that
did
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
come
back
to
justice
kagan's
question.
your
position
is
really
nothing
can
be
done
by
a
generic
that
is
blocked
from
marketing
a
drug
for
a
nonpatented
use
by
a
use
code
that
--
that
is
--
that
seems
to
cover
that
use--
