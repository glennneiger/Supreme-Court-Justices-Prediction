is
it
first
--
is
it
first
approved,
the
drug
itself
--
they're
not
claiming
that,
because
that
--
that
patent
has
expired,
hasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
fact
that
the
fda
and
not
the
patent
holders
were
drafting
the
use
code
at
the
time
this
legislation
passed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
horwich,
do
we
--
do
we
know
what
fda's
position
is
in
this
case?
is
the
position
you
are
presenting
the
position
of
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you
described
sounded
very
much
like
this
case.
so
if
the
--
what
was
the
d.c.
circuit
case?
if
--
if
the
dc
circuit
said
its
arbitrary
and
capricious
not
to
--
to
just
accept
the
brand's
use
code--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
fixed?
i
missed
what
you
said.
what
was
fixed
in
the
counterclaim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can't
imagine
that
that
would
really
come
to
--
i
mean,
if
it's
a
transposition
of
numbers,
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
proceeding
to
get
it
changed.
i
mean,
the
minute
that
was
noticed,
i
assume
that
the
brand
manufacturer
would
change
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
perry,
can
i
ask
you,
on
that
core
question:
we
have
a
patent
on
a
drug
alone.
it
expires,
and
then
the
patent
holder
gets
a
label
patent
that's
on
a
method
of
use,
and
we
have
a
generic
that
wants
to
sell
the
drug
alone
which
is
no
longer
patented.
doesn't
want
to
sell
it
in
combination
with
anything
else,
wants
to
sell
the
drug
alone.
can
it
do
so
without
infringing
the
method
of
use
patent?
