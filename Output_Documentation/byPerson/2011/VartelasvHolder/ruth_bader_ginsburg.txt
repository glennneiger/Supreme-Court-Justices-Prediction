as
far
as
going
forward
is
concerned,
that's
--
that's
just
the
way
it
is,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they
--
could
they
--
the
--
the
person
who
--
who
is
here
and
then
the
new
law
is
passed,
could
that
person
have
petitioned
for
discretionary
relief
before
traveling?
justice
ruth

it
wasn't
before.
we
--
i
think
we
have
held
that
an
immigration
lawyer
is
obliged
to
tell
a
defendant
facing
a
criminal
charge
what
the
legal
consequences
--
what
the
immigration
consequences
will
be.
and
here,
suppose
before
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
plea
in
this
case,
the
attorney
had
said,
once
you've
served
your
time,
you
will
be
able
to
take
brief
casual
trips.
that
would
have
been
after
his
advice,
right?
before
iirira,
i
mean.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant
to
use
"lawyer"
talking
to
his
client,
and
the
client
wants
to
know:
before
i
enter
this
plea,
what
will
be
the
consequence
for
me?
and
the
question
that
is
asked
is:
will
i
be
able
to
visit
my
mother
in
greece?
what
should
the
lawyer
--
what
should
the
lawyer
at
that
time
have
answered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
characterization?
it
would
seem
to
me
to
make
common
sense,
yes,
the
trigger
is
that
he
has
gone
abroad
and
is
returning.
but
the
target,
they
say,
was
the
crime.
that's
why
the
law
--
the
law
really
doesn't
care
about
the
travel
back
and
forth;
what
it
cares
about
is
this
person
was
convicted
of
a
crime.

petitioner
vartelas,
a
native
of
greece,
became
a
lawful
permanent
resident
in
1989.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiring
to
make
counterfeit
travelers'
checks
in
1994
and
he
served
a
prison
term
of
four
months.
at
the
time
of
his
plea,
an
alien
with
a
conviction
like
his
could
travel
abroad
for
brief
periods
without
jeopardizing
his
resident
alien
status.
vartelas
did
so,
travelling
occasionally
to
greece,
both
before
and
after
serving
his
prison
sentence
to
assist
his
aging
parents.
in
1996,
congress
enacted
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigrant
responsibility
act
commonly
known
as
iirira.
under
that
act,
aliens
who
have
committed
certain
crimes,
among
them,
counterfeiting,
may
be
stopped
from
entering
the
united
states
when
they
return
from
a
trip
abroad.
by
travelling
and
returning,
they
risk
loss
of
their
permanent
resident
status
and
are
in
danger
of
becoming
excluded
aliens.
vartelas
was
so
stopped
in
2003
and
was
placed
under
an
order
permanently
removing
him
from
the
united
states.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
time.
does
iirira
reach
back
and
apply
to
aliens
like
vartelas,
who
committed
a
crime
before
iirira's
effective
date?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
iirira
applied
to
vartelas
and
affirmed
the
removal
order.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
applying
iirira
to
vartelas
rather
than
the
law
that
governed
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
would
retroactively
attach
a
new
disability
to
his
prior
offense.
our
decisions,
however,
have
long
applied
a
presumption
against
retroactive
legislation.
we
read
laws
as
operating
prospectively
only,
unless
congress
has
instructed
their
application
to
past
events.
the
iirira
provision
in
question,
the
government
acknowledges,
does
not
say
anything
about
its
temporal
reach.
we
hold
that
it
does
not
apply
to
vartelas'
pre-iirira
conduct.
beyond
doubt,
iirira's
entry
bar
would
impose
a
severe
disability
on
lawful
permanent
residents
like
vartelas.
loss
of
the
freedom
to
travel
abroad,
for
example,
to
fulfill
his
obligations
attend
births,
weddings
or
funerals
of
family
members,
attend
to
financial
interests
or
to
respond
to
a
family
emergency,
those
are
harsh
penalties.
the
government
argues
that
congress
has
attached
no
disability
to
the
past
conduct
of
residents,
like
vartelas,
rather
the
government
says,
“the
relevant
event
is
not
vartelas'
pre-iirira
criminal
offense,
it
is
his
post-iirira
act
of
returning
to
the
united
states
after
travel
abroad,”
but
we
disagree.
true,
vartelas'
return
to
the
united
states
from
a
week
of
caring
for
his
parents
in
greece
occasioned
his
treatment
as
a
newcomer
to
our
shores,
but
the
reason
for
his
detention
and
the
disability
imposed
on
him
was
not
his
lawful
foreign
travel,
it
was
his
pre-iirira
conviction.
the
second
circuit
ruled
that
iirira's
--
iirira's
entry
bar
did
not
apply
retroactivity
--
retroactively
to
vartelas
because
he,
in
no
way,
relied
on
immigration
laws
when
he
committed
the
counterfeiting
offense.
this
reasoning
is
doubly
fraud.
first,
as
the
government
acknowledges,
our
decisions
in
point
do
not
require
a
party
challenging
the
retroactive
application
of
a
statute
to
show
reliance
on
the
prior
law
in
arranging
his
conduct.
second,
vartelas
likely
did
rely
on
existing
immigration
law
when
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
counterfeiting
offense.
there
can
be
little
doubt,
we
observed
in
the
recent
decision
that
alien
defendants
considering
whether
to
enter
into
a
plea
agreement
ordinarily
are
acutely
aware
of
the
immigration
consequences
of
their
convictions.
for
these
reasons
spelled
out
in
full
in
the
court's
opinion,
we
hold
that
vartelas'
reentry
into
the
united
states
after
a
brief
trip
to
greece
was
governed
not
by
iirira,
but
by
the
legal
regime
in
place
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito
join.
