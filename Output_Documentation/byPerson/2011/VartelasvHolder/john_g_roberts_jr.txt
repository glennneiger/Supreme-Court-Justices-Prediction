chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1211,
vartelas
v.
holder.
mr.
bibas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
expectations
argument
is
that
somebody
trying
to
figure
out
whether
to
go
ahead
and
rob
the
bank
is
going
to
say,
well,
if
i
do
and
i
am
caught
and
i
am
found
guilty,
i
won't
be
able
to
take
temporary
trips
abroad,
so
i'm
not
going
to
rob
the
bank?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
concerned
under
landgraf,
i
think,
with
whether
or
not
it
disrupts
settled
expectations,
and
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
issue
enters
into
the
expectations
at
all
when
the
pertinent
act,
which
is
the
commission
of
the
crime,
not
the
pleading
guilty,
takes
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
my
colleague
would
be:
no;
what
they
want
to
regulate
is
the
staying
in
the
country,
and
they're
trying
to
make
that
as
uncomfortable
as
possible
in
order
to
encourage
the
individual
to
leave.
if
he
can't
go
to
the,
you
know,
the
parent's
party,
the
cousin's
wedding
or
whatever,
he
is
just
going
to
leave,
and
then
once
he
does,
he
can't
come
back.
why
would
--
why
would
the
government
care
--
it's
a
question
for
them,
i'm
sure.
why
would
they
care
whether
somebody
that
they
don't
want
to
be
here
stays
here?
it
seems
to
me
the
exact
opposite.
so
i
would
have
thought
your
argument
--
your
answer
would
be,
no,
what
they
are
trying
to
regulate
is
not
the
coming
and
going,
but
simply
the
staying.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
matter
in
the
examples
that
you
just
gave
that
admission
to
the
united
states
is
purely
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
while
we
might
conclude
that
teaching,
being
a
member
of
the
bar,
whatever,
is
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
which
privilege
was
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that
might
have
been
regarded
as
such
then,
but
not
under
current
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
they
decide
to
plead
guilty.
the
operative
issue
here
is
when
they
commit
the
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
--
so
this--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
have
to
--
i
just
don't
understand
this
statute.
this
is
somebody
we
would
not
allow
into
the
country.
and
yet
the
only
thing
we
say
is:
you
can't
leave.
i
just
don't
understand
how
that
--
how
that
works.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
and
i
understand
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
actually
deporting
the
person.
but
here
i
think
the
one
thing
you
want
the
person
to
do
is
leave.
maybe
for
a
particular
event,
but
maybe
he
will
decide
to
stay
in
greece
if
once
he's
there
for
the
--
but
it
seems
very
odd
to
say:
we
are
going
to
show
you
how
much
we
don't
want
you
here;
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
leave.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
policy
underlying
the
rule
that
doesn't
allow
somebody
who
has
lawful
status
here
to
go
to
his
grandmother's
funeral--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
come
back?
it's
going
to
take
four
days.
he
goes,
he
comes
back.
what
policy
supports
prohibiting
that
travel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
they're
two
different
things.
but
i
don't
know
that
you've
articulated
what
the
policy
is
to
prevent
--
prohibit
somebody
from
doing
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
go
over
again
for
me
your
distinction
of
st.
cyr?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
argue
that
--
that
the
significance
of
what
the
individual
is
giving
up
makes
a
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
difference
in
terms
of
what
they
face
if
they
don't
plead
guilty?
i've
always
had
difficulty
with
st.
cyr
on
the
notion
that
say,
someone
pleads
--
is
facing,
you
know,
10
years,
and
they
plead
--
plead
guilty
to
2
years.
the
--
the
reason
they
did
that
was
to,
you
know,
avoid
one
of
these
--
positions.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
to
avoid
8
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
just
wonder
if
the
relative
significance
of
what
is
at
issue
under
the
immigration
law
is
something
we
can
take
into
account,
or
if
st.
cyr
prohibits
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
bibas,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1211,
vartelas
versus
holder.
