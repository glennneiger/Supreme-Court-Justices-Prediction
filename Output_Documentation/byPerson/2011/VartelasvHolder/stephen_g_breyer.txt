would
have
been
the
law.
fleuti.
and
the
answer
to
the
question
would
have
been:
yes,
you
can
make
trips
abroad,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
in
st.
cyr,
as
i
read
it,
on
pages
322
and
23,
the
court
focused
directly,
not
on
the
crime
point
of
time,
but
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea.
and
what
the
court
says
there
is
that
a
person
who
is
thinking
of
pleading
guilty
might
well
have
taken
into
account
the
fact
that
he
could
ask
the
attorney
general
later
when
he's
about
to
be
deported
to
exercise
discretion
in
his
favor.
so
that's
--
as
i
read
those
pages,
you
can
say,
i'm
not
reading
them
correctly,
but
that's
how
i
read
them.
and
then,
having
read
them
that
way,
i
thought
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
person
who
is
sitting
at
the
table
and
deciding
whether
to
plead
guilty
or
not
is
likely
to
think,
well,
if
i
plead
guilty,
i
can
always
ask
for
discretion.
that's
st.
cyr.
well,
if
i
plead
guilty,
i
can
still
visit
my
aging
parents
and
grandparents,
a
matter
that
could
be
of
importance
to
some
people,
as
opposed
to
whether
i
will
never
see
them
again.
now,
that
seems
to
be
the
question.
is
the
second
as
likely
to
be
in
the
person's
mind
as
the
first?
and
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
i
mean,
maybe
it
would
be.
there
isn't
that
much
chance
of
getting
discretion.
it
might
be
important
to
some
people
to
visit
their
aging
parents
and
grandparents.
so,
go
ahead.
answer
the
question.
is
the
one
more
important
than
the
other?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i
--
isn't
my
question
the
key
question?
now
you
can
answer
that
no.
but
i,
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
could
prove
that
the
only
thing
that
mattered
to
lprs
who
plead
guilty,
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
visiting
their
parents
and
grandparents,
a
matter
i
doubt;
but,
you
can
say,
even
on
that
situation,
it
would
make
no
difference.
or
you
could
say,
i
think
the
one
is
as
important
as
the
other.
or
you
could
say
they
are
not.
i
just
want
to
get
your
full
answer,
your
whole
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
do
you
--
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
isn't
even
clear
whether
it
overrules
rosenberg
v.
fleuti.
i
mean,
they
talk
about
admission,
but
admission
after
all
could
be,
we
have
an
exception
for
the
4-day
trip.
that's
what
the
court
said
effectively
in
rosenberg
v.
fleuti.
so
congress
certainly
wasn't
clear
on
what
policy
they're
following.
i
would
have
thought
that.
you
can
disagree
with
that.
but
i
--
but
the
part
that's
still
gnawing
at
me:
95
percent
of
the
people
plead
guilty.
all
right.
you
know.
everybody
pleads
guilty.
or
about.
and
now
the
--
the
consequence
that
this
ex
post
enacts
is
he
can't
take
the
4-day
trip.
and
you
keep
saying
well,
a
4-day
trip
requires
action
on
a
person's
part.
right.
of
course
it
does.
so
why
does
that
matter?
i
mean,
the
fact
is
he
can't
take
the
4-day
trip.
a
4-day
trip
requires
action.
you
have
to
buy
a
trip
--
ticket.
you
have
to
get
on
a
plane.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
--
that's
why
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
and
the
ambiguity
of
the
statute
are
relevant.
like
with
sorna
you
would
apply
it
backwards,
because
that's
a
pretty
clear
intent.
i
don't
know
about
you
know,
like,
"three
times
and
you're
out"
statutes,
et
cetera.
but
--
but
here
you
have
a
disability
on
the
ones
--
the
disadvantage
to
the
person
pleading
guilty,
the
problem
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
you
have
the
policy
that
with
a
--
fill
in
the
blank
--
with
a
statute
that
doesn't
talk
about
it,
but
simply
uses
a
new
definition
of
admission
or
admissibility.
that's
--
do
you
want
to
say
something
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
more
than
that
--
i'm
ignoring
--
more
than
that,
i'm
saying
what's
the
policy
on
the
other
side?
the
policy
that
favors
the
retroactivity
despite
the
fact
that
the
person
might
not
have
pleaded
guilty?
and
that's
why
i
was
interested
in
the
chief
justice's
question
and
also
the
ambiguity
of
the
language
in
the
statute
that
they
used.
