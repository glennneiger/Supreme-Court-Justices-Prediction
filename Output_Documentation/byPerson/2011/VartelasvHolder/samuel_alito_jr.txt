what
is
the
difference
between
someone
who
commits
the
crime
just
before
the
act
is
passed
and
someone
who
commits
the
crime
just
after
the
act
is
passed?
the
person
who
commits
the
crime
just
after
the
act
is
passed
had
the
expectation
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
that
if
he
did
certain
things
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
have
this
consequence
from
his
conduct.

but
the
person
who
commits
the
crime
just
after
the
act
is
passed
had
the
expectation
prior
to
that
time,
that
had
--
if
he
did
certain
things
in
the
future
he
wouldn't
suffer
certain
consequences.

do
you
think
we
have
the
authority
to
tell
congress
how
to
draft
its
laws?
i
thought
what
we
were
doing
was
trying
to
infer
what
they
intended.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
we
send
them
a
drafting
manual?
now,
you
can
do
this,
but
you
can
only
do
it
if
you
do
it
--
if
you
follow
the
steps
that
we've
prescribed.
and
we've
said
this
over
and
over.
it
seems
to
be
completely
unfounded.
