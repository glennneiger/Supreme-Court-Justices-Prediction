justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bibas,
i
have
--
this
is
almost
a
question
of
personal
privilege.
you
--
you
make
your
whole
argument
on
--
on
the
basis
of
landgraf.
so
does
the
government.
you
do
not
cite,
the
government
cites
but
does
not
discuss
the
relevant
portion
of
a
--
of
a
later
case
which
involved
the
same
question,
republic
of
austria
v.
altmann.
i
concurred
separately
in
landgraf
because
i
thought
that
the
test
that
the
court
was
using,
upsetting
settled
expectations,
was
indeed
the
proper
test
for
constitutional
provisions
forbidding
ex
post
facto
laws,
which
is
where
the
court
derived
it
from,
justice
story's
opinion
in
a
new
hampshire
constitutional
case.
but
i
said
in
my
concurrence
that
the
proper
test
for
--
for
the
other
issue
of
retroactivity,
namely,
constitutionality
aside,
does
this
statute
mean
to
be
applied
only
in
the
future
or
in
the
past?
and
for
that
i
propose
--
well,
i'll
read
you
what
we
said
in
altmann:
"our
approach"
--
which
postdates
landgraf.
"our
approach
to
retroactivity
in
this
case
thus
parallels
that
advanced
by
justice
scalia
in
the
concurrence
in
landgraf.
"
quote,
and
it's
quoting
the
concurrence:
"the
critical
issue
is
not
whether
the
rule
affects
vested
rights
or
governs
substance
or
procedure,
but
rather
what
is
the
relevant
activity
that
the
rule
regulates.
"
"absent
clear
statement
otherwise,
only
such
relevant
activity
which
occurs
after
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
is
covered.
"
"most
statutes
are
meant
to
regulate
primary
conduct
and
hence
will
not
be
applied
in
trials
involving
conduct
that
occurred
before
their
effective
date.
"
"but
other
statutes
have
a
different
purpose
and
therefore
a
different
relative
retroactivity
event.
"
--"relevant
retroactivity
event".
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
the
--
the
event
that
is
sought
to
be
regulated
is
entry
into
the
united
states,
and
it
is
clear
that
this
statute
applies
only
to
prospective
entry
into
the
united
states.
it
doesn't
apply
to
past
entry
so
that
those
people
who
came
in,
in
violation
of
this
statute
can
be
deported.
now,
why
shouldn't
we
apply
that
rule
in
this
case,
as
we
did
in
the
republic
of
austria
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
it
be
limited
just
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
that's
the
majority's
approach?
justice
antonin
scalia
its
--
its
holding.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
a
lot
of
--
but
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
which
we
interpret
to
be
valid
and
not
retroactive
which
have
a
substantial
effect.
you
can
pass
a
statute
altering
the
rules
of
evidence
which
have
the
effect
of
making
someone
who
committed
a
prior
murder
convictable,
whereas
before
he
was
not
convictable.
and
we
don't
just
look
to
the
effect
and
say,
well,
it
has
that
substantial
effect
so
it's
operating
retroactively.
we
say,
no,
it's
a
rule
of
evidence
that
applies
in
the
future
and
that
evidence
can
come
in.
that's
the
big
problem
with
this
other
approach.
there
are
often
adverse
effects
upon
activities
that
occurred
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
but
we
still
regard
the
statute
as
prospective
only
and
therefore
not
subject
to
special
rules
for
people
who
are
affected.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
intended,
right.
we're
not
talking
about
constitutionality.
we
are
talking
about
a
rule
that
it's
presumed
that
statutes
are
only
prospective,
right?
and
your
argument
is
the
reasonable
expectation
of
congress
when
they
passed
this
was
that
it
would
only
apply
to
two
people
who,
what,
committed
the
crime
or
were
convicted
after
the
statute
passed?
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
there's
a
--
a
likelihood
of
quite
inequitable
enforcement
if
indeed
you
adopt
a
position
we're
going
to
pick
up
all
of
these
people
and
send
them
away.
that's
not
going
to
happen.
it'll
--
it'll
be
hit
and
miss.
and
on
the
other
hand,
you
can
enforce
it
rigorously
and
equitably
upon
everyone
if
you
only
forbid
reentry
to
those
people
who
want
to
come
back
in,
and
they'll
have
to,
you
know,
give
their
names
to
immigration,
and
you
can
check
on
--
on
this
status.
that
seems
to
me
a
sensible
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
--
i
don't
know
--
i
think
it
would
be
prospective
and
unconstitutional
because
it's
irrational.
i
mean,
not
--
not
everything
that's
unconstitutional
is
unconstitutional
--
not
everything
that
is
unconstitutional
is
not
prospective,
it
seems
to
--
or
do
you
think
that's
so?
if
it's
--
if
it
is
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
law,
the
statute
has
to
be
pro
--
has
to
be
prospective.
i'm
sorry,
has
to
be
assumed
not
to
cover
that
prior
conduct.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
if
it
does,
it
automatically
has
to
be
interpreted
not
to
cover
that,
by
reason
of
the
presumption
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
--
even
if
you
had
pleaded
guilty
to
spousal
abuse?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
landgraf
is
clear
and
settled,
and
you
are
over
there
in
congress
and
you
say:
boy,
i
know
how
this
statute
is
going
to
come
out
under
landgraf.
justice
antonin
scalia
better
than
i
am.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
can
be
explained
because
congress
understands
that,
who
knows
whether
it's
going
to
be
held
to
be
retroactive
or
not;
if
you
surely
want
it
to
apply
you
better
say
so.
if
that's
the
rule
you
want
us
to
adopt,
that's
okay.
