justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
bibas,
how
is
it
different
then
from
a
felon
in
possession
statute,
where
you
look
at
the
past
offense--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
then
you
say,
well,
this
man,
because
of
that
past
offense,
can't
buy
a
gun
in
the
future?
how
is
it
different
at
all?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
isn't
the
--
the
government,
congress,
making
the
exact
judgment
same
judgment
here?
if
the
activity
to
be
regulated
is
entry
and
congress
is
making
a
judgment
that
we
do
not
want
dangerous
people
to
enter,
and
we're
using
the
conviction,
the
prior
conviction,
as
a
marker
for
who
was
dangerous,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
has
done
in
the
felon
in
possession
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
event
is
the
event
that
the
government
cares
about,
which
is
the
entry
into
the
country.
it's
not
as
though
the
--
you
know,
the
government
says
--
just
picks
an
event
at
random
and
--
and
makes
it
the
trigger
mechanism.
the
government
has
picked
the
event
that
it
wants
to
regulate,
which
is
entry.
justice
elena
kagan
how
do
you
explain
st.
cyr
if
reliance
isn't
necessary?
st.
cyr
is
all
about
reliance.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
do
you
have
any
case
in
which
a
court
has
deemed
its
statute
retroactive
even
though
it
wasn't
triggered
until
the
party
took
some
further
action?
is
there
any
case
out
there
either
from
this
court
or
from
another
court
where
we've
said
it's
retroactive
even
though
it
depends
upon
a
future
event.
justice
elena
kagan
what
do
you
think
the
trigger
to
be?
because
in
your
brief
you
kept
on
talking
about
the
trigger
being
the
trip.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
you
would
have
talked
more
about
the
activity
being
the
attempt
to
enter
the
country.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
what
is
going
to
be
important
to
the
person,
right?
it's
not
inadmissible
and
all
the
legal
terms.
it's:
am
i
going
to
be
able
to
make
short
trips
to
visit
my
mother?
yes,
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
make
short
trips
to
visit
your
mother.
and
then
you
wake
up
the
next
morning,
and
congress
has
passed
a
statute,
and
now
you
are
not
able
to
take
short
trips
to
visit
your
mother.
so
something
very
real
has
happened
to
the
life
of
this
person.
justice
elena
kagan
you
are
quite
right,
mr.
miller,
as
a
formal
matter
that
that
is
true,
that
that's
the
words
of
the
statute.
but
how
many
times
has
the
department
of
homeland
security
tried
to
declare
a
person
inadmissible
on
the
basis
of
the
commission
of
a
crime
without
putting
into
evidence
either
a
conviction
or
a
guilty
plea?
justice
elena
kagan
i
can't
imagine
that
it's
like
more
than
on
one,
you
know,
five
fingers
of
your
hand.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
people
prove
crimes
in
this
area,
isn't
it,
by
convictions
or
guilty
pleas.
justice
elena
kagan
or
after
trial
or
convictions
by
guilty
pleas.
justice
elena
kagan
if,
as
a
fact
of
the
matter,
the
way
the
commission
of
crime
is
proved
in
this
area
is
through
showing
a
conviction,
does
your
distinction
stand
up
at
all?
justice
elena
kagan
it
--
it
can't
be
right
that
it's
"any"
future
conduct.
if
--
if
there's
a
trigger
mechanism
that
is
entirely
random,
you
know,
it's
--
you
can
be
deported
if
you've
committed
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
in
the
past,
but
not
until
you
go
to
the
movies
on
a
saturday.
surely
that
would
not
change
the
analysis.
justice
elena
kagan
and
how
do
we
separate
those
two?
how
do
we
decide
that
this
is
not
that,
and
that
it's
instead
something
else,
that
it's
a
regulation
of
future
conduct?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
miller,
the
solicitor
general
actually
represented
to
us
--
in
the
judulang
argument
used
that
as
an
example,
the
fleuti
case,
as
something
that
people
doing
pleas
did
think
about
and
did
rely
upon.
