the
career
criminal
enhancements,
instead
of
the
felon
in
possession,
and
assuming
your
arguments,
what
limits
can
congress
put
on
anyone
with
respect
to
future
conduct
if
it's
going
to
be
a
burden?
under
your
view,
it
stops
people
from
traveling.
career
criminal
statutes
put
on
the
distinct
disadvantage
of
a
longer
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
argument
that
you
just
made
go
more
to
whether
or
not
the
bia's
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
rescind
the
fleuti
decision
--
but
you
assume
that's
what
its
intent
was?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
assume
that,
if
we
assume
that
was
congress's
intent,
doesn't
that
start
give
you
the
conclusion?
if
congress
tended
to
undo
it,
doesn't
that
prove
that
they
intended
to
effective
retroactively?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
those
go
to
the
basic
premise.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
assume
congress
intended
to
rescind
the
prior
doctrine,
isn't
that
proof
itself
that
it
intended
to
apply
the
statute
retroactively?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
this
conduct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
that
the
case
here,
meaning
--
it
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
which
is,
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
punish
those
individuals,
those
lprs
who
have
committed
this
kind
of
crime,
by
not
letting
them
travel
or
come
back
in.
that's
really
what
their
argument
is,
is,
you
are
imposing
a
punishment,
a
disability
for
having
committed
the
crime.
you're
not
imposing
a
disability
merely
for
the
act
of
traveling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
prior
to
the
fernandez
case,
the
illegal
act
remained.
and
so
that
was
within
your
control.
but
the
--
you
can't
undo
an
illegal
act
that
you've
done
to
be
able
to
travel.
the
act
is
now
part
of
your
background.
and
so
there's
nothing
in
your
control
to
change
that
act
once
the
statute
has
passed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
--
you're
carrying
that
around
as
a
disability.
