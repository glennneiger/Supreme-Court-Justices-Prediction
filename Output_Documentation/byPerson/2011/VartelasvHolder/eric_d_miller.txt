mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
discussion
so
far
this
morning
reveals,
the
court's
retroactivity
analysis
takes
account
of
a
number
of
different
factors,
but
the
one
that
is
most
significant
and
indeed
in
this
case
virtually
dispositive
is
that
the
application
of
section
1101(a)(13)
to
petitioner
was
triggered
only
because
he
engaged
in
voluntary
conduct
that
postdated
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
--
i
mean
they
are
closely
connected
together
in
time
and
they
both
--
but
they
both
postdate
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
but
--
well,
the
thing
that
is
being
regulated
by
section
1101(a)(13)
is
the
entry
of
aliens
into
the
united
states.
the
statute
sets
out
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
determining
when
an
alien
arriving
at
the
border
seeking
to
come
into
the
united
states
should
be
regarded
as
seeking
an
admission.
so
that's
conduct
that
takes
place
in
the
future.
part
a
of
1101(a)(13)
sets
out
the
general
definition
of
admission
and
then
(c)
sets
out
a
number
of
exceptions.
and
so
taken
together
they
are
part
of
a
comprehensive
effort
to
codify
fleuti
in
some
respects
and
in
particular
romanette
(ii),
the
180-day
provision
is
actually
a
fairly
generous
codification
of
fleuti
probably
extending
beyond
what
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
brief
trip
under
fleuti.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
about
that.
and
the
first
is
that
that
is
a
feature
of
the
statute
at
large.
that
exists
even
with
respect
to
post
enactment
criminal
convictions.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
and
the
second,
i
think
to
understand
it,
it's
helpful
to
look
at
the
history.
the
distinction
between
grounds
of
inadmissibility
and
grounds
of
deportability
goes
back
all
the
way
back
to
the
1917
act.
in
that
statute,
a
single
crime
of
moral
turpitude
was
the
basis
for
inadmissibility
but
was
generally
not
a
basis
for
deportability
unless
it
had
a-one-year
sentence
and
was
committed
within
five
years--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
what
the
--
history
shows
that
it's
the
crossing
the
border
that
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
legally
significant
event.
this
court's
cases
recognizing--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
think,
i
think
the
most
important
point
about
the
consequence
of
the
plea
is
that
as
an
immediate
result
of
the
plea
under
pre-iirira
law,
so
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
in
1984,
he
made
himself
inadmissible.
so
that
is
not
anything
that
has
changed.
so
he
knew
that
he
was--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
the
lawyer
should
have
said:
by
pleading
guilty,
you
are
making
yourself
inadmissible
to
the
united
states.
under--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
and
i
think
you
might
also
have
said
that
under
a
current
law,
you
will
not
be
regarded
as
seeking
an
admission
if
you
take
a
brief,
casual,
and
innocent
trip.
but
the
change
in
the
law--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
i
mean,
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
is
a
serious
consequence
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
law.
but
the
court
has
made
clear
in
landgraf
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases
that
even
uncontroversially
prospective
statutes
can
impose
burdens.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
you
have
correctly
described
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
st.
cyr,
and
i
think
that
that
reasoning
highlights
two
ways
in
which
this
case
is
significantly
different.
and
the
first
is
that
in
st.
cyr
it
was
the
guilty
plea,
the
conviction
that
was
legally
significant
under
the
provision
is
of
iirira
at
issue
there,
and
the
court
emphasized
that
a
guilty
plea
is
a
quid
pro
quo,
it
has
to
be
knowing
and
voluntary.
the
court
cited
santabello
against
new
york,
a
due
process
about
guilty
pleas.
and
then
the
one
difference
in
this
case
is
that
the
legally
significant
event
here--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
conclusion
to
the
first
part
of
the
answer
is
that
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
because
what
matters
here
is
not
the
guilty
plea,
what
triggers
the
application
of
1101(a)(13)(c)
is
the
underlying
criminal
conduct.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
have
any--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
would
say
that
--
this
is
a
statue--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
statute
is
being
applied
by,
in
the
first
instance,
by
customs
officers
at
the
airport
or
at
the
land
border
crossing.
they
have
access
to
a
number
of
databases
which
include
not
only
records
of
convictions
but
also
things
like
arrest
warrants.
and
an
arrest
warrant
by
itself
would
not,
not
be
enough
to
show
that
a
person
had
in
fact
committed
an
offense,
but
it
might
trigger
some
further
inquiry
from
the
customs
officer
that
would
lead
to
finding
out
more
information
or
perhaps
getting
an
admission
from
the
person.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
mean,
there
is
still,
i
think,
a
significant
formal
distinction
and
then
there
is
also
another
important
distinction
from
st.
cyr
which
is
that
that
was
the
case
where
as
a
result
of
the
guilty
plea
plus
the
change
in
law,
the
person
there
faced
immediate
deportability
with
no
prospect
of
discretionary
relief.
and
the
court
said
that
there
is
a
clear
difference
for
purposes
of
the
retroactivity
analysis
between
the
possibility
of
deportability
and
a
certainty
of
deportation.
here,
not
only
is
he
not
deportable,
but
there
is
no
immediate
consequence
for
him
at
all.
the
statute
only
has
any
effect
on
him
when
he
engages
in
the
post
enactment
travel.
and
i
think--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right.
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
highlights
one
of
the
distinctions
between
this
case
and
cummings
against
missouri
and
ex
parte
garland.
in
those
cases,
you
had
statutes
that
were
nominally
prospective
in
application,
but
the
court
actually
said
that
we
think
that
what
is
really
happening
here
is
the
statutes
are
imposing
punishment
for
completed
acts.
to
the
extent
there
was
any
doubt
in
those
cases
themselves,
this
court
discussed
them
both
in
harisiades
v.
shaughnessy
and
said
that
it
viewed
them
as
cases
about
punishment.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
mean,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
you
see
that
it's
a
--
the
comprehensive
regulation
of
crossing
the
border,
which
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
legally
significant
event.
there
are
six
subparts
to
1101(a)(13)(c).
five
of
them
have
nothing
to
do
with
past
conduct.
they're
about
the
--
the
nature
of
the
trip
and
--
and
what
the
alien
is
doing
as
he's
coming
in.
and
then
you
have
--
have
this
one,
which
is
of
a
piece
with
the
long
history
of
drawing
a
distinction
between
inadmissibility
and
deportability.
and
i
think
it
recognizes--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
i
--
i
think
it
reflects
a
--
a
judgment
on
the
part
of
congress
over
many,
many
years
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
to
an
alien,
all
right,
we're
not
going
to
go
and
try
and
find
you
and
take
you
and
kick
you
out
of
the
country.
it
is
quite
another
to
say
you
may
freely
cross
our
borders
--
even
after
having
left,
you
may
come
back,
and
we're
--
without
any
inquiry.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
mean
--
other
than,
you
know,
referring
you
to
--
to
the
history
and
to
--
to
the
idea
that
has
been
reflected
--
this
court
has
recognizes
that
control
over
the
border
is
a
core
sovereign
prerogative
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
congress's
immigration
power.
and
i
think--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
--
if
i
could
just
first
address
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
in
fact
ever
gets
fleuti,
and
just
to
be
clear
on
that
--
the
question
presented
assumes
that
it
does.
the
petitioner
isn't
challenging
that.
and
the
board
in
the
collado-munoz
decision
has
explained
why
the
--
the
statute
in
fact
does
have
that
effect.
and
i
--
i
think
the
significance
of
this
post-enactment
conduct,
the
significance
of
the
trip,
is
illustrated
there
by
this
court's
decision
in
fernandez-vargas,
which
--
which
made
clear
that
when
you
have
--
when
the
application
of
the
statute
is
within
the
control
of
the
person
to
whom
it's
being
applied,
because
he
has
to
do
something
after
it
comes
into
effect
--
there,
it
was
choosing
to
remain
in
the
united
states
and
becoming
subject
to
the
reinstatement
of
a
prior
order
of
removal
--
here,
it's
taking
the
travel.
but
that
goes
a
long
way
towards
establishing
that
it
--
it
doesn't
have
a
retroactive
effect,
that
it's
regulating
future
conduct.
another--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--in
fernandez-vargas,
the
--
the
conduct
that
subjected
the
alien
to
the
application
of
this
--
this
procedural
--
disadvantageous
removal
procedure
--
was
remaining
in
the
united
states.
and
it's
true
that
that
conduct
was
unlawful,
but
for
purposes
of
the
retroactivity
analysis,
the
court
didn't
focus
on
whether
it
was
lawful
or
unlawful.
what
matters
is
that
it
was
conduct
that
was
in
the
future,
that
that
was
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
so
here,
although
the
--
the
trip
is
not
unlawful
in
that
sense,
it
is
future
conduct,
and
here
as
in
fernandez-vargas,
there
is
ample
warning
--
which
was
another
point
the
court
emphasized
in
that
case
--
ample
warning
that
the
statute
would
be
applied
to
people
who
engaged
in
that
conduct.
i
--
i
do
want
to
address
your--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
--
the
reason
it
wouldn't
--
is
reflected
in
some
of
this
court's
--
in
the
ex
post
facto
analysis.
if
you
have
a
statute
that
for
example
makes
it
a
crime
to
have
engaged
in
certain
conduct
in
the
past,
and
then,
you
know,
something
--
some
commonplace
utterly
trivial
activity
in
the
future,
i
think
a
court
looking
at
that
would
say,
this
is
not
--
although
it
is
nominally
prospective
--
this
is
really
a
statute
aimed
at
punishing
the
prior
conduct.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
mean,
i
think
--
the
hypothetical
statute
i
was
describing
i
think
would
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause
under
the
sort
of
analysis
that
this
court
used
in
smith
v.
doe.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
you
mean
--
if
you
mean
a
parallel
statute
in
the
civil
context.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
i
--
i
think
that's
the
best
reading
of
--
of
landgraf.
and
i
think
under
the
analysis
suggested
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
landgraf,
i
think
you'd
want
to
look
at
that
statute
and
say
this
is
really
a
statute
that's
aimed
at
regulating
the
--
the
past
conduct,
and
that
--
that
has
a
retroactive
effect.
so
--
to
--
to
finish
that
thought,
i
think
i
would
just
say
that
there
is
a
narrow
category
of
cases
where
you
have
what
is
informed,
a
prospective
regulation
that's
really
aimed
at
--
aimed
at
burdening
or
punishing
a
past
act.
but
this
is
not
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
--
in
the
criminal
context,
the
court
has
used
the
analysis
of
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez
to
figure
out
whether
a
statute
is
--
is
imposing
punishment
for
past
conduct.
and
that
looks
at
a
number
of
factors.
and
the
most
important
factor
under
that
test,
the
court
has
said,
is
whether
the
statute
appears
to
be
related
to
a
legitimate
prospective
regulatory
purpose.
and
so
that's
why,
for
example,
statutes
like
922(g),
the
felon
in
possession
statute,
which
was,
i
would
point
out,
amended
back
in
1996
to
add
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence
which
had
not
previously
been
something
that
would
subject
one
to
a
firearms
disability.
that
was
added.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
question
has
held
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
i
think
implicitly
has
held
that
it
does
in
fact
reach
that
conduct.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--specifically
addressing
that
question,
but
--
but
yes,
because
there
you
have
a
statute
that
is
regulating
future
conduct,
it
only
applies
to
somebody
who
engages
in
the
future
conduct.
the
sex
offender
registration
laws
are
another
example
of
--
this
court
has
upheld
that
kind
of
law
obviously
imposes
a
very
significant
burden
of
people
on
the
basis
of
prior
conduct,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
some
burden
by
itself
does
not
mean
that
the
statute
is
retroactive.
nor
does
it
mean
that
it
is
appropriately
viewed
as
imposing
a
disability.
i
mean
i
think
that
the
court
in
landgraf
quoted
justice
story's
formulation
of
a
disability
as
referring
to
statutes
that
impose
a
disability
in
respect
to
transactions
that
are
already
passed.
so
it
is
not
enough
that
there
used
to
be
something
that
you
could
do
and
now
in
the
future
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
do
that.
that
is
not
a
disability
in
the
relevant
sense,
and
if
it
were
the
court
would
have
a
very
difficult
line-drawing
problem
to
figure
out
why
it
is
that
statutes
like
922(g)
are
okay,
or
sex
offender
administration
laws,
or
any
number
of--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think,
if
you
are
--
if
you're
--
if
you
are
asking
whether
congress
has
specifically
addressed
the
temporal
scope
of
the
statute,
we
--
we
--
we
acknowledge
under
st.
cyr
that
it
hasn't.
and
so
that's
why
we're
at--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
that
the
--
the
policy
is
congress
was
trying
to
redefine
--
they
were
replacing
the
old
term
of
entry
and
replacing
it
with
a
new
concept
of
admission,
they're
trying
to
redefine
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
treatment
of
aliens
arriving
at
the
border.
and
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
parts
of
it
together
as
a
scheme
that
was
to
be
applied
going
forward,
when
people
arrived
at
the
border
in
the
future,
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
it's
twofold,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
in
st.
cyr
the
legally
significant
event
was
the
conviction,
the
guilty
plea.
here
the
guilty
plea
is
significant
because
it
makes
petitioner
inadmissible
but
that
was
true
under
current
law.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
our
second
point,
is
that
--
st.
cyr
said
there
is
a
big
difference
between
immediate
deportability
and
the
potential--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
i
think
it
is
certainly
appropriate
to
take
into
account,
that
however
--
however
significant
the
application
of
fleuti
might
be
to
aliens,
it's
on
a
different
order
of
significance
from--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
--
i
think
--
we
don't
question
that
that's
something
that
people
might
have
--
have
been
aware
of,
and
have
been
thinking
about,
but
it
not
something
that
was
bargained
for
in
the
plea
agreement,
because
it's
not
something
that
is
affected
by
the
plea
agreement.
the
statute
here
is
triggered
by
the
post-enactment
conduct
of
entering
the
country,
but
also
by
the
--
the
pre-enactment
conduct
of
committing
the
crime.
and
as
petitioner
has
acknowledged,
there
isn't
any
reliance
in
the
state
of
immigration
law
when
you
choose
to
commit
the
crime.
so
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
difference
from
the
scenario
that
was
addressed
in
judulang.
