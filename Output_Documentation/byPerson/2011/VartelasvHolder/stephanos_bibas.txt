mr.
stephanos
bibas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
government
concedes,
ina
subsection
101(a)(13)(c)(v)
added
by
iirira
does
not
expressly
mandate
retroactivity.
under
landgraf,
applying
that
new
provision
would
attach
new
legal
consequences
to
pre-iirira
offenses,
penalizing
both
those
who
travel
and
those
who
don't.
covered
lawful
permanent
residents
could
not
visit
their
parents
abroad
without
being
forced
to
abandon
their
children
here.
they
would
be
removed
from
the
country
or
else
confined
here.
either
way,
they
would
lose
an
ability
they
had
under
pre-iirira
law
based
on
pre-iirira
offenses.
thus
applying
the
subsection
to
them
would
be
impermissibly
retroactive.
the
settled
expectations
at
issue
here
are
those
of
round
trips
by
lawful
permanent
residents,
not,
as
the
government
would
put
it,
one-way
tickets
or
first-time
entrants.
these
are
people
who
have
structured
their
lives
here.
they
have
homes,
spouses,
children,
and
careers
here,
and
yet
have
a
settled
expectation
that
they
will
be
able
to
maintain
ties
to
visit
aged
and
ailing
parents
abroad,
to
go
to
funerals
and
wakes
and
visit
them
in
the
hospital
and
surgeries.
our
amici,
the
nacdl
brief,
and
the
asian
american--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
because
congress
has
expressly
changed
the
law
post-iirira.
the
question
is
for
those
before
iirira,
whether
those
settled
expectations
are
being
disrupted.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
possibility.
that
is
not
the
same
as
the
automatic
ability
to
travel,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
discretionary
relief
was
denied.
it
depends
on
a
different
set
of
factors
from
the
automatic
pre-iirira
ability
to
travel.
but
it
is
a
theoretical
possibility
in
some
cases.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
you
phrased
it
specifically
as
a
reliance
argument,
which
is
an
alternative.
even
the
government
concedes
it
is
not
a
prerequisite.
second,
the
right
time
to
look
at
expectations
is
the
moment
before
the
law
is
enacted:
does
one
have
an
expectation
at
that
point
that
one
will
be
able
to
continue--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
practical
impact
is
a
new
travel
disability
or
penalty,
just
as
in
landgraf.
the
discrimination
there
had
been
illegal
for
decades,
yet
adding
a
new
form
of
damages
to
it
was
impermissibly
retroactive.
in
hughes
aircraft,
filing
false
claims
with
the
government
had
been
illegal
for
years,
yet
broadening
the
class
of
people
who
could
file
suit
and
removing
a
defense
--
no
reliance
possible
at
all,
but
there
was
a
settled
expectation
that
there
would
be
no
additional
consequences
attached
to
that.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
congress
of
course
has
the
power
to
change
things.
but
the
expectation
until
an
act
is
passed
is
that
the
consequences
are
fixed
in
time.
and
if
congress
decides
that
the
potential
unfairness
is
outweighed
by
the
benefits
of
making
the
act
retroactive--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--and
yet
congress
has
--
has
affirmatively
warned
and
put
everybody
on
notice
that
now
there
is
this
new
consequence;
you
may
be
deterred
by
this
new
consequence;
we
may
be
punishing
you
by
this
new
consequence,
but
the
consequence
has
been
announced.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor.
as
a
--
first
of
all,
our
reply
brief
discussed
altmann,
and
the
majority
of
the
court
has
viewed
that
as
limited
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
context.
but
taking
your
test--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--that
--
that's
the
majority's
approach.
but
taking
your
test
on
its
own
terms,
what
you
are
pointing
out
is
there
is
a
future
act--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--i'm
sorry.
the
majority
in
fernandez-vargas
expressly
said
that
republic
of
austria
was
in
a
sui
generis
context
and
that
its
holding
shouldn't
be
extended
to
--
to
fernandez-vargas.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes.
but
to
take
--
to
look
at
your
test,
you
were
pointing
out
that
there
is
a
future
event
which
the
government,
practically
its
entire
theory
turns
on
that.
but
even
if
there
is
a
future
event,
there
is
a
past
event
being
regulated
here,
and
the
activity
at
issue
under
your
test
would
be
the
pre-iirira
offense,
not
just
the
innocent
post-iirira
travel.
what
we
have
is
future
lawful
travel,
concededly
lawful,
nothing
nefarious
needs
to
be
shown
of
it.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
right.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
there
are
five
pertinent
distinctions.
permit
me
to
unpack.
the
first
and
most
important
is
that
the
landgraf
test
should
have
a
broader
scope
than
the
ex
post
facto
context
in
these
criminal
cases
because
congress
can
override
it
expressly.
since
the
ex
post
facto
clauses
disable
both
state
and
federal
legislatures
from
acting
at
all,
the
deprivation
of
the
power
must
be
narrow
and
careful
so
state
and
federal
legislatures
can
continue
to
regulate
felon
in
possession
or
racketeering
or
the
other
crimes
the
government
advances.
but
landgraf
just
tells
congress
how
to
legislate.
it's
a
background
rule.
so
it's
legitimate
to
have
a
presumption
against
retroactivity
sweep
more
broadly,
as
congress
is
free
to
override
it
and,
as
i
will
explain,
does
override
it
regularly.
secondly,
felon
in
possession
is
inherently
dangerous
conduct.
this
is
a
protective
law.
it's
not
just
a
punitive
or
deterrent
law.
the
third
and
related
point
is
that
felon
in
possession
laws
are
tailored.
there
is
a
nexus
to
a
danger,
a
threat
to
people
suffering
firearm
--
it's
narrowly
tailored.
fourth--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
two
are
quite
different.
felon
in
possession
is
limited
to
firearms
in
the
hands
of
proven
dangerous
people.
here
we
have
a
law
that
says
you
can
stay
in
the
country
indefinitely;
we
are
going
to
discourage
you
from
going
abroad
and
leaving
the
country,
because
we
will
make
it
harder
for
you
to
come
back.
that
is
not
tailored
at
all
to
protecting
the
people
inside
the
united
states.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
felon
in
possession
statute,
as
this
court
noted
in
heller,
is
part
of
a
long
tradition
of
forbidding
such
activity
as
a
crime.
so
it's
hard
to
say
there
are
settled
expectations
being
upset
by
felon
in
possession
laws.
and
the
final
one
is,
congress
can
do
that
simply
by
being
explicit,
and
it
has
done
so
repeatedly
in
laws
such
as
iirira.
elsewhere
in
iirira,
section
321(b)
says
the
aggravated
felony
definition
applies
to
convictions
entered
before,
on
or
after
the
statute's
effective
date.
it
knew
how
to
do
it;
it
did
it
more
than
a
dozen
other
times
in
iirira,
as
this
court
noted
in
st.
cyr.
it
didn't
spell
it
out
here.
the
point
of
this--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor,
and
as
we
noted
in
the
criminal
context,
this
court
in
witte
and
gryger
notes,
it's
a
heavier
punishment
on
the
new
crime
because
it's
aggravated,
because
it's
repeated.
and
because
congress
has
more
leeway
in
the
ex
post
facto
context
and
because
recidivism
enhancements
have
a
long
tradition,
it's
entirely
legitimate.
there's
no
need
to
say
that
that's
punishing
the
past
offense
because
the
future
offense
--
it
--
it's
permissible
to
increase
it
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
and
that's
an
inquiry
that's
different
from
the
landgraf
test
here,
because
all
congress
has
to
do
is
spell
out
expressly:
we
want
to
apply
this
to
convictions
entered
before,
on,
or
after
the
statute's
effective
date,
which
it
did
in
321(b),
which
it
didn't
do
here.
so
if
we
were
looking
at
the
function
of--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--we've
assumed
arguendo
because
that's
the
premise
of
the
question
presented.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
all
the
case
law,
the
legislative
history,
and
other
discussion
was
about
certain
other
aspects
of
entry
doctrine
that
needed
to
be
changed.
the
discussion
was
express
about
saying:
we're
changing
the
definition
from
entry
to
admission,
because
we
don't
want
people
who
snuck
into
the
country
outside
of--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--right.
right.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
no,
your
honor--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--no,
your
honor.
congress
can
intend
to
rescind
--
to
abrogate
a
statute
such
that
it
will
have
no
effect
going
forward.
but
as
this
court
noted
in
landgraf,
the
--
the
background
default
rule
that
the
public
and
congress
expect
is
that
new
laws
will
apply
prospectively.
that
has
the
virtue
not
only
of
giving
a
clear
background
rule
which
--
against
which
congress
legislates,
against
which
it
did
legislate
in
iirira,
but
it
also
forces
congress
to
advert
to
the
potential
unfairness
of
retroactivity
and
decide
that
the
benefits
outweigh
it.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
landgraf.
it
makes
perfect
sense
and
that
clear
statement
rule
serves
the
function
of
having
them
smoke
out
into
the
open.
if
you
think
it's
beneficial
to
make
this
affect
convictions
in
the
past,
just
say
so.
but
it
didn't.
so
to
go
back
to
our
primary
point,
with
the
practical
impact
or
effect
being
a
new
travel
disability,
the
government's
argument
seems
to
boil
down
to
that,
because
there
is
one
event
that
must
happen
after
the
statute's
effective
date,
therefore
there
can
be
no
retroactive
effect.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
is
an
effect
test,
and
under
martin
v.
hadix
and
landgraf,
we
have
to
take
a
commonsense
functional
view
of
what
the
effects
are,
the
new
legal
consequences.
i--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor,
you're
right
that,
particularly
given
the
strange
way
in
which
its
written,
it's
hard
to
understand
it
as
something
other
than
a
penalty
and
possibly
a
deterrent,
but
certainly
a
penalty
based
on
past
crimes,
to
make
life
uncomfortable.
and
that
does
not
speak
of
a
protective,
forward-looking
exclusive
function,
if
that's
the
test.
but
to
go
back
to
the
earlier
point,
if
that
were
--
if
we
were
to
follow
the
approach
justice
scalia
outlined,
that
would
be
the
right
response.
but
we
don't
even
need
to
get
there
because
the
primary
test
under
landgraf
is
not
the
point
or
function
or
purpose,
but
an
effects
test.
the
effect,
as
the
government
concedes,
is
to
force
him
to
choose
between
his
parents
in
greece
and
his
wife,
children,
career,
and
home
here.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
well,
setting
aside
the
difference
between
the
ex
post
facto
context
and
the
civil
context,
and
there
is
the
procedural
distinction,
which
i
know
your
honor
didn't
sign
on
to,
it's
also
relevant
that
here
it
is
directly
expressly
tied
to
a
past
conduct.
it's
a
precondition.
it's
not
even
a
piece
of
evidence
or
something
one
can
draw
an
inference
from.
it
is
a
precondition
for
ineligibility
under
101(a)(13)(c)(v).
and
therefore
it
looks
like
the
disability
that
justice
story
said,
a
disability
has
to
involve
future
conduct.
but
if
it's
expressly
disabling
future
conduct,
that's
a
penalty
on
past
conduct.
the
disability
in
st.
cyr
of
not
being
able
to
apply
for
future
discretionary
relief.
the
disability
in
some
other
cases
of
this
court
that
we
found
after
briefing
and
alerted
opposing
counsel
to,
cummings
v.
missouri
and
ex
parte
garland
in
volume
71
of
the
u.s.
reports.
even
though
the
law
there
forbade
teaching
in
the
future
or
holding
office
or
preaching
or
being
a
member
of
the
bar,
the
government's
theory
would
say:
those
are
post-enactment
things;
just
refrain
from
teaching;
you
don't
have
a
vested
right
to
teach.
this
court
said:
no;
we
recognize
those
are
expressly
targeted
to
punish
the
past
membership
in
the
confederacy
that
triggers
that
disability.
and
so
the
government's
approach
would
render
the
justice
story's
disability
category
a
nullity.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
important.
that
only
matters
for
the
vested
rights
argument,
and
this
court
in
cummings
said
expressly
it
was
dealing
with
a
privilege.
so
--
moreover--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--the
privilege
of
teaching
or
the
privilege
of
holding
office.
so
you
can't
rest
on
a
right
privilege--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--okay.
well,
another
answer
--
in
st.
cyr
the
government
made
the
same
argument,
and
this
court
said:
well,
sure,
congress
has
the
plenary
power
to
change
the
rules
any
time
it
wants;
just
do
it
expressly.
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
can,
but
whether
it
has
in
fact
changed
the
rules
expressly,
to
make
that
express
tradeoff
that
the
potential
unfairness
of
retroactivity
is
worth
it.
now,
the
final
point
here,
i
believe
there
was
some
reference
earlier
to
reliance
in
the
offense.
and
as
the
government
concedes,
reliance
is
not
a
prerequisite.
this
court
can
rule
for
petitioner
and
not
even
bother
with
reliance.
but
the
presence
of
reliance
here
is
an
extra
factor
that
supports
--
that
shows
the
retroactivity
to
be
obvious
and
severe.
so
the
court
of
appeal's
whole
premise
that
reliance
is
necessary
goes
away.
the
government
concedes
the
court
of
appeals
implicitly
was
wrong
on
that.
as
a
practical
matter,
our
point
is
that
defendants
rely
on
the
known
consequences
of
offenses
when
they
decide
to
plead
guilty.
as
this
court
recognized
in--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--we
don't
claim
that
there
is
a
reliance
interest
in
committing
the
crime,
but
in
the
decision
to
plead
guilty
as
a
practical
matter
the
defendants
weigh
a
number
of
consequences.
and
one
of
those
is
whether
they
might
have
a
4-month
discount
off
their
sentencing
guidelines,
which
was
the
inducement
here,
and
another
one
is
will
they
ever
be
able
to
see
their
parents
again.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
our
primary
position
is
that
because
reliance
isn't
necessary
all
of
them
benefit
from
it,
because
they
all
have
settled
expectations.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes.
and
at
the
end
of
this
court's
opinion
the
court
said
that
the
presence
of
this
reliance
made
the
retroactive
effect
especially
obvious
and
sincere
--
especially
obvious
and
severe
in
st.
cyr.
that
did
not
purport
to
overrule
holdings
in
landgraf
and
hughes
aircraft
where
there
had
been
no
legally
cognizable
reliance.
so
st.
cyr
is
an
easy
case
because
of
the
guilty
plea
because
of
the
reliance.
but
landgraf
and
hughes
aircraft
didn't
involve
any
reliance
and
there
was
still
retroactivity
because
the
settled
expectations
were
disrupted
because
there
were
new
consequences
attached
to
pre-enacted
conduct.
so
regardless
of
whether
there
is
reliance,
there
are
settled
expectations
that
are
upset
by
a
law
whose
function
or
point
is
to
punish
and
deter
misconduct
based
on
past
wrongs.
my
client--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
that
is
the
background
default
rule
against
which
congress
legislates.
and
in
laws
such
as
iirira
and
sorna
and
elsewhere,
congress
spells
out
what
it
wants
to
apply
to
pre-enactment
offenses
to
pre-enactment
conduct.
that's
the
defeasible
civil
retroactivity
rule
that
can
reach
more
broadly
than
the
ex
post
facto
jurisprudence--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor.

are
all
disabilities
taking
away
a
future
ability
based
on
a
past
wrong.
that's
what
the
disability
category
has
to
mean
if
it's
to
remain
meaningful.
and
the
government's
approach
would
gut
justice
story's
fourth
category.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
five
points.
the
first
one
is
the
statute
is
poorly
tailored
to
any
protective
or
forward-looking
effect.
as
the
court
has
noted,
its
perverse
effect
is
to
discourage
people
from
leaving
the
country,
to
keep
them
in.
so
any
idea
that
the
purpose
is
to
get
them
out
doesn't
square
with
the
way
the
statute
is
written.
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
while
the
post-iirira
innocent
travel
may
be
the
trigger
here,
the
obvious
target
is
the
pre-iirira
offense.
the
statute
is
tied
to
misconduct.
the
natural
inference
of
making
this
conduct
not
just
a
piece
of
evidence
but
a
prerequisite
is
that
it
is
the
misconduct
that
is
being
penalized.
second,
the
impact
we
suggest
is
the
relevant
test.
the
impact
is
a
penalty.
it
is
a
disability
based
on
a
past
act
that
mr.
vartelas
is
now
helpless
to
undo.
that
is
all
that
is
required
under
landgraf.
if
congress
thinks
it
important,
it
can
expressly
require
retroactivity.
but
it
hasn't
done
so.
third,
let
me
make
clear
that
we
have
alternative
theories
here.
reliance
is
something
that
makes
the
case
worse.
it
is
something
that
exacerbates
the
problem,
makes
it
obvious
and
severe.
and
our
amici,
the
nacdl
brief,
points
out
very
movingly
how
important
these
kinds
of
considerations
are
in
immigrants'
decisions
to
plead
guilty.
here
for
example,
my
client
received
a
4-month
discount
off
his
sentencing
range.
it's
entirely
plausible
to
believe
that
immigrants
in
his
situation
might
value
the
ability
to
stay
in
the
same
country
with
their
4-year-old
and
2-year-old
child
as
much
as
4
months
in
jail.
but
our
broader
theory
is
that
the
violation
of
settled
expectations
is
sufficient
whether
or
not
there
is
reliance.
the
settled
expectations
that
one
has
of
planning
one's
life
in
this
country
and
yet
having
relatives
abroad
one
will
tend
to
or
care
for
their
business,
etcetera,
that
is
sufficient.
just
as
in
landgraf
and
hughes
aircraft
company
there
were
no
legally
cognizable
reliance
interests
in
discriminating
or
in
submitting
false
claims,
but
changing
the
penalty
is
enough.
fourth,
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr
i
believe
strongly
helps
our
case.
the
first
reason
is
that
it
imposed
a
disability,
a
disability
on
filing
in
the
future
for
discretionary
relief,
but
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
burdening
past
conduct.
secondly,
st.
cyr
didn't
purport
to
change
the
holdings
in
landgraf
and
hughes
aircraft
company
that
those
are
other
ways
of
showing
impermissible
retroactivity.
the
logic
in
st.
cyr
is
ineluctable
that
because
you
are
burdening
a
decision,
a
decision
that,
as
the
court
and
the
amici
in
st.
cyr
noted,
matters
greatly
and
factors
into
the
plea
bargaining
calculus,
that
the
retroactivity
is
especially
obvious
and
severe.
and
let
me
note
that
st.
cyr
was
decided
under
this
same
statute,
a
privilege,
not
a
right,
a
privilege
that
congress
can
abrogate
at
any
time.
that
did
not
influence
this
court's
holding
at
all.
the
right-privilege
distinction
is
dead
in
this
area
of
law.
if
there
is
a
privilege
under
iirira
to
apply
for
discretionary
relief,
there
is
a
privilege
to
not
be
subject
to
the
disability
on
one's
traveling
and
returning.
finally,
let
me
talk
about
the
criminal-civil
line.
my
my
brother
here
introduced
smith
v.
doe
and
mentioned
some
of
the
sex
offender
cases.
i've
explained
why
the
criminal
cases
in
ex
post
facto
are
different,
but
let
me
go
into
some
more
detail.
the
court
is
well
familiar
with
smith
v.
doe.
that
was
a
civil
case
that
doe
attempted
to
turn
into
a
criminal
case
under
the
very
demanding
standard
in
kennedy
v.
mendoza.
but
that's
a
very
uphill
fight.
as
the
court's
opinion
recognized,
the
court
must
be
very
deferential
before
turning
something
facially
civil
into
criminal
because
then
it's
categorically
forbidden
and
it
comes
with
the
criminal
procedure
protections
in
the
bill
of
rights.
that's
not
what
we
are
doing
now.
we
are
not
trying
to
say
this
law
is
forbidden.
smith
v.
doe
involved
a
law
where
the
court's
opinion
said
on
its
face:
the
legislature
made
it
retroactive;
it
says
it's
retroactive.
federal
law
sorna
is
expressly
retroactive
in
section
113(d).
iirira
is
expressly
retroactive.
that's
a
different
inquiry,
where
you're
asking
does
the
ex
post
facto
clause
forbids
something
that
is
expressly
retroactive,
does
mendoza-martinez
turn
it
into
a
criminal
case?
versus
here,
where
it's
not
retroactive.
all
congress
has
to
do
is
spell
it
out.
if
this
court
adheres
to
its
previous
jurisprudence,
the
guidance
to
the
drafters
across
the
street
is
clear:
just
draft
the
statutes
the
way
you
have
always
been
doing
it,
say
before,
on,
or
after
effective
date.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
your
honor,
this
court
has
said
that
it's
important
to
adhere
to
its
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction
because
it's
a
settled
background
rule
against
which
congress
legislates,
which
it
is
aware
of.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephanos
bibas
let
me
explain.
this
court
decided
landgraf
2
decades
ago.
a
few
years
after
landgraf,
congress
passed
iirira
in
1996.
iirira
contains
express
retroactivity
provisions
that
go
hand
in
glove
with
the
landgraf
presumption.
and
then
congress
passed
sorna,
to
which
my
brother
alludes.
sorna
in
2005
likewise
in
section
113(d)
says:
yes,
this
sex
offender
registration
shall
apply,
the
attorney
general
can
apply
it
to
people
with
pre-sorna
convictions.
congress
understands
the
landgraf
presumption.
in
those
statutes
and
others
it
has
legislated
against
it.
it
can
continue
to
do
it
because
this
court
should
continue
to
use
its
traditional
tools--
mr.
stephanos
bibas
--yes,
your
honor,
and
a
clear
statement
rule
has
that
virtue,
as
i
believe
your
honor
is
well
aware.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
remand.
