mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
substitution
without
making
any
inquiry,
even
of
counsel,
into
the
specific
situation
alleged
by
mr.
clair.
the
court
did
not
hold
that
mr.
clair
was
entitled
to
substitute
counsel.
it
did
not
hold
that
he
was
entitled
to
amend
his
petition.
it
did
not
hold
that
substitute
counsel
was
even
required
or
advised
to
seek--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
if
you
have
any
obligation
whatsoever
--
and
i
want
to
make
clear
that
there
are
--
these
kinds
of
letters
and
requests
for
last
minute
substitutions
happen
all
the
time
and
in
the
mine
run
there
may
not
be
any
duty
of
independent
inquiry.
if
you
had
one,
it
would
simply
be
to
do
what
the
court
did
in
march,
which
is
to
inquire
of
the
two
counsel
in
the
case,
is
there
anything
to
this,
and
then
rule.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
of
course
not.
in
this
situation,
the
court
had
pending
before
it
a
first
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
alleged
both
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial
and
specific
brady
violations.
and
by
the
way,
in
answer
to
your
first
question,
the
district
judge
announced
that
he
was
retiring
on
june
27th,
effective
the
30th.
so
this
was
beforehand.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
--
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
he
--
he
hadn't
announced
that
he
was
going
to
retire.
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
he
did
retire
is
only
to
my
mind
an
explanation
for
why
he
failed
to
conduct
the
minimal
inquiry--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
he
had
previously--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not
--
he
--
the
error
would
have
been
the
same
if
he
had
stayed
on
the
bench
for
another
10
years.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
--
it
goes
to
their
complaints
with
the
remedy
in
the
case.
that
is,
they
are
faulting
that
the
remedy
is
not:
go
back
and
ask
this
judge
to
decide
whether
substitution
was
appropriate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
--
i
apologize
if
it
gave
that
impression.
i
don't
mean
any
innuendo
in
the
case.
our
proposition
is
simply
this:
prior
to
adjudicating
the
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
brady,
when
the
court
receives
a
letter
that
says,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry
for
writing
a
second
time.
as
you
know,
i
have
always
maintained
that
i'm
innocent.
my
investigator
has
just
discovered
physical
evidence
in
of
the
state's
files
that
he
believes
may
clear
me.
my
counsel--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
goes
to
the
remedy,
and
it
goes
to
the
fact
he--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
--
they
are
alleging
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
send
it
back
to
the
judge
to
do
what
he
had
declined
to
do.
and
our
proposition
is,
because
substitute
counsel
had
been
in
place
for
5
years
and
because
the
judge
who
had
superintended
the
case
for
12
years
was
no
longer
there,
it
was
appropriate
and
within
the
court
of
appeals'
discretion
under
28
u.s.c.
2106
to
remand
it
to
the
new
judge,
with
new
counsel,
for
--
to
allow
new
counsel
simply
to
ask
the
new
judge,
who
had
not
heard
all
of
the
witnesses
or
the
evidence,
to
demonstrate
why,
if
counsel
thought
it
was
appropriate,
to
allow
him
to
amend
the
petition
under
rule
15(a)(2).
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
this
--
it
may
very
well
be
what
was
in
his
thought
processes,
but
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
that
a
district
judge
faced
with
a
request
to
substitute
counsel
at
this
very
late
stage
is
appropriately
--
appropriately
takes
into
account
everything
that
has
happened,
everything
that
he
has
allowed
to
happen,
everything
that
defense
counsel
has
--
has
done,
and
he
is
obviously
permitted
to
approach
this
request
with
a
high
degree
of
skepticism,
and
a
strong--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
i
mean--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
of
course--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
you
know,
if
the
district
judge
is
presented
with
factually
supported
allegations
that
appointed
counsel
has
failed
to
pursue
newly
discovered
evidence
that
may
be
germane
to
an
issue
to
be
decided,
especially
where
the
potential
import
of
that
evidence
is
specifically
explicated
and
corroborated
by
a
willing
percipient
witness,
in
this
case
the
investigator
who
viewed
it,
the
district
judge
has
an
obligation
simply
to
ask
counsel
for
the
state
and
counsel
for
the
defense,
please
respond,
as
the
judge
did
in
june
--
in
march.
now,
in
march
the
judge
--
the
judge
asked
for
a
response--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
because
the
judge
could
not
know
that
based
on
the
allegations
in
the
ford
letter
and
the
clair
letter.
it
is
not
the
case,
going
to
justice
alito's
point
from
my
question
to
my
friend,
that
what
was
represented
in
that
letter,
the
new
physical
evidence
related
only
to
dna
testing.
there
was
a
specific
allegation
that
there
were
fingerprints
located
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
previously
had
been
represented
to
the
trial
court
and
to
defense
counsel
either
to
be
unusable
or
on
materials
that
had
gone
through
the
u.s.
mail
so
that
the
probative
value
would
be
limited,
and
both
of
those
things
were
untrue.
and
mr.
ford
said
to
the
judge:
"i'm
prepared
to
explain
to
you
exactly
what
those
prints
are,
and
they
have
not
been
tested
against
anyone,
including
the
other
people
who
were
suspected
of
the
identical
type
murder
the
night
before
in
the
same
area
or
other
potential
suspects
in
this
case
like
mr.
henrickson.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
they
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
can't
ask
to
amend
a
petition
in
a
case
in
which
there's
a
final
judgment.
he
could
file
a
--
he
could
file
a
rule
60(b)
motion,
which
he
did
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
very--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
so
that
he
wouldn't
be
accused
of
having
simply
sat
on
his
rights
while
the
ninth
circuit
was
deciding,
he
filed
a
rule
60
--
he
filed
for
leave
to
file
a
rule
60(b)
motion
and
said
in
essence:
look,
the
investigator
has
discovered
this
new
evidence;
i
haven't
been
able
to
test
it
or
examine
it;
please
give
me
leave
to
do
that,
because
i
believe
it
may
support
reopening
the
judgment.
the
district
judge
said:
i'm
not
going
to
allow
you
to
make
that
motion.
the
ninth
circuit
issued
a
mandamus
directing
the
district
judge
to
rule
on
the
motion.
she
then
denied
it,
essentially
finding
that
the
motion
should
be
denied
because
mr.
grele,
substitute
counsel,
hadn't
already
proven
to
her
what
it
is
that
he
was
seeking
to
find
out,
that
is
what
does
this
evidence
show.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
an
answer
to
your
question,
but
of
course
i'll
defer
to
any
superseding
question
from--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--uh-huh.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
of
course
not.
i
mean,
even
the
state
acknowledges
that
asking
the
judge
whether
or
not
there
should
be
substitution
when
there
has
been
substituted
counsel
since
the
appeal
was
taken
is,
as
they
call
it,
an
academic
exercise.
but
technically
the
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
guess
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
that
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
or
what
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit
to
be
doing,
which
was
to
issue
an
order
--
basically
say
the
substitution
motion
had
to
be
decided
within
the
broad
discretion
that
the
law
allows
before
entry
of
judgment.
i'm
going
--
we
are
going
to
do
as
best
we
can
to
put
mr.
clair
back
in
that
position.
it
seems
to
us
that
since
he
--
since
counsel
said,
represented,
as
soon
as
it
was
asked
after
his
letter,
there
is
an
irreconcilable
breakdown
and
substitution
is
advised--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
has
counsel
and
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
i
do
have
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
if
i
can
just
--
thank
you.
if
i
can
just
finish
answering
--
i
apologize
for
my
lengthy
answers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
in
essence
what
has
happened,
what
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
decided
is
to
say:
look,
because
we
have
had
substitute
counsel
for
5
years
and
the
fpd
has
said
it
couldn't
continue,
we're
allowing
this
to
go
back
and
let
substitute
counsel
convince
the
judge,
if
it
can,
if
it
chooses
to,
whether
or
not
to
exercise
its
considerable
discretion
in
allowing
leave
to
amend
the
petition
before
judgment.
the
judge
may
very
well
say
no,
and
the
case
is
then
back
before
us.
but
it
might
say
yes.
in
other
words,
to
do
what
in
essence
is
the
prejudice
or
materiality
inquiry
that
judge
taylor
would
have
engaged
in
if
he
found
that
there
was
a
breakdown.
if
mean,
if
there's
a
breakdown
and
the
judge
says
that
the
only
new
evidence
is
that
the
moon
was
in
the
fifth
house
and
that
doesn't
depend
on
anything,
i'm
denying
--
or
it
was
a
new
moon,
i'm
denying
this.
justice
breyer,
i
--
i
agree
with
you
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
struggling
to
figure
out
a
way
to
most
efficiently
resolve
the
multiple
appeals
that
were
pending
in
front
of
them.
and
they
understood
from
the
rule
60(b)
appeal
that
was
also
pending
and
from
the
appeal
on
the
denial
of
substitution
that
there
was
this
newly
discovered
evidence
in
the
state's
files;
that
the
investigator
who
looked
at
it
thought
that
it
was
really
important;
and
they
had
no
record
about
what
it
was
or
whether
it
should
have
been
considered.
now,
they
could
have
said,
well,
we're
going
to
direct
the
rule
60(b)
judge
to
grant
leave
to
examine
the
physical
evidence
and
analyze
it.
and
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
the
rule
60(b)
judge
not
to
allow
mr.
clair
at
least
to
make
some
showing.
but
the
more
straightforward
way
would
have
been
to
say:
you
didn't
inquire
of
counsel;
counsel
may
have
had
a
very
good
reason
for
not
pursuing
this;
but
in
the
face
of
the
specific
allegation
by
a
willing,
percipient
witness
that
there
is
highly
material
evidence
in
the
state
files
and
the
public
defender
is
refusing
to
do
anything
about
it,
all
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
holding
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
ask.
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
if
that
had
--
if
the
judge
had
inquired
of
counsel
and
counsel
had
given
that
reason,
that
would
be
something
that
the
court
could
evaluate
in
deciding
whether
the
balancing
test
that
is
required
by
the
interests
of
justice
standard
satisfied
his
inquiry.
but
we
don't
have
any
--
i
doubt
very
much
that
that
is
what
counsel
would
have
said.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
would
think
that
that
--
not
only
that
goes
into
the
calculus,
but
all
of
the
i
would
say
well-articulated
doctrines
that
congress
and
this
court
have
applied
essentially
establishing
presumptions
against
reopening
long-litigated
matters,
whether--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--all
of
those
things
go
into
the
interest
of
justice
balancing.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
of
course.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
of
course
--
of
course
not.
the
only
point
is,
what
--
what
clair
was
basically
saying
is,
my
investigator
has
just
found
evidence
that
he
believes
is
highly
exculpatory,
physical
evidence
in
the
state's
files
that
was
previously
represented
not
to
exist.
my
counsel
is
refusing
to
do
anything
about
it.
please
give
me
somebody,
whether
it's
--
have
my
counsel
do
it
or
some
new
counsel,
to
present
this
to
the
judge,
just
so
the
judge
can
decide
in
evaluating
these,
the
brady
and
the
ineffective
assistance
claim.
and
if
this
is
as
represented,
it
could
be
highly
material
to
those
claims.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that
in
a
value
--
if
substitute
counsel
--
if
there
is
a
remand
in
this
case
and
substitute
counsel
makes
a
rule
15
motion,
the
court
will
evaluate
that
under
the
broad
interests
of
justice
standard.
i
mean,
whoever
the
counsel
is
has
to
acquit
his
or
her
professional
obligations.
it
may
very
well
have
been,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
judge
taylor
had
said,
look,
i
--
please
write
to
me
in
3
days
or
let's
have
a
status
conference
and
explain
to
me
what's
going
on;
i
understand
you
went
to
see
this
evidence.
why
aren't
you
--
is
it
true
that
you
are
not
pursuing
it?
and
if
so,
why
not?
that
would
have
completely
acquitted
the
judge's
responsibility.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't
think
it's
strange,
justice
scalia.
and
let
me
explain
at
least
my
own
reaction
to
this.
3599,
what
--
the
mandatory
appointment
requirement
was
cleaved
from
what
is
now
3006
--
the
discretionary
appointment,
where
congress
said
in
the
controlled
substances
act,
look,
in
death
cases,
at
trial
and
in
habeas,
we're
not
--
we
don't
want
to
leave
it
to
the
court's
or
the
magistrate's
discretion
whether
or
not
to
appoint.
we
are
appointing.
and
when
it
did
so
--
i
mean,
it
is
in
essence
a
--
a
--
a
progeny
--
i
mean,
it
is
--
it
is
a
cleaving
of
what
was
a
discretionary
obligation.
congress
--
congress
had
no
need
in
3599
to
reiterate
the
language
in
30
--
3006a(c),
which
itself
is
not
limited
to
appointments
under
3006a(c).
i
am
reading
from
page
95
of
the
petition
appendix.
the
statute
says
--
i'm
sorry.
it's
page
93.
the
interests
of
justice
standard
says
this
--
and
i'm
--
it's
the
last
sentence
on
page
93a
--
"the
united
states
magistrate
judge
or
the
court
may
in
the
interests
of
justice
substitute
one
appointed
counsel
for
another
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings.
"
it
doesn't
say
"counsel
appointed
under
the
discretionary
authority
of
3006.
"
if,
like
the
rest
of
subsection
(c),
of
which
it
is
a
part,
is
a
general
rule
for
duration
and
substitution
of
appointments.
so
even
if
it
were
not
true
that
the
sentence
itself
applied
a
force,
it's,
i
think,
only
consistent
with
what
congress's
manifest
intention
in
enacting
35
--
what
became
3599(e)
to
permit
that
when
substitution
is
requested,
that
motion
be
adjudicated
in
light
of
the
interests
of
justice.
and
indeed,
that's
what
the
state
told
judge
taylor
the
standard
was
in
this
very
case.
i
mean,
look
at
it
this
way,
justice
scalia:
imagine
that
a
district
court
--
i
realize
that
the
cases
will
be
few
and
far
between.
very
few,
and
very
far
between
--
where
at
a
late
stage
of
the
proceedings,
the
court
will
interject
substitution
of
counsel
over
the
state's
opposition,
and
over
the
court's
understandable
desire
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
efficiently
and
fairly
adjudicating
motions.
but
in
the
rare
case
where
the
district
judge
says,
gee,
i
think
the
public
interests
--
i
think
that
the
interests
of
justice
really
would
support
putting
somebody
else
in
here,
but
i
can't
because
it
doesn't
fit
within
one
of
the
three
boxes
of
the
tests
that
the
state
ex
malo
has
announced
in
its
merits
brief
in
this
court,
it's
just
impossible
to
imagine
that
congress
would
have
wanted
a
judge
to
say,
gee,
this
is
one
of
these
one
in
a
million
cases
where
the
interests
of
justice
really
requires,
but
i
can't
do
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
mean,
we
don't
--
we're
not
really
arguing
about
the
standard
one
way
or
the
other.
the
point
--
the
only
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
whatever
the
standard
is
--
and
we
think
it
has
to
be
something
like
interests
of
justice
--
but
a
judge
in
this
particular
situation
with
respect
to
this
particular
set
of
circumstances,
there
is
--
my
investigator,
a
willing
percipient
witness
has
gone
to
the
police
station
and
found
evidence
that
he
believes
may
well
clear
me,
it
requires
at
a
minimum
that
the
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
first
of
all,
the
other
evidence
in
this
--
the
case
against
mr.
clair
in
essence
was
the
wired
statement
that
he
made.
and
even
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
said
only
of
that
equivocal
statement,
that
it
was
"capable
of
being
regarded
as
an
admission.
"
now,
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
we're
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
the
answer
--
i
know
how
frustrating
this
is,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
to
both
--
is
yes
to
both
scenarios,
particularly
because
there
was
no
physical
evidence
linking
him,
and
really,
the
state's
case
boiled
down
to
this
pretty
confusing
statement.
it
was
particularly
salient
to
say,
wait
a
minute.
i
mean,
the
--
the
district
judge
had
no
idea
that
there
was
any
dispute
about
physical
evidence,
or
any
physical
evidence
was
in
the
state's
files
that
hadn't
been
disclosed
and
hadn't
been--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
alito,
i
mean,
we
are
of
course
all
arguing
in
a
vacuum
here,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
fingerprint
evidence
if
it
were
tested
and
run
against
databases
would
show.
but
let
me
give
you
one
not
at
all
far-fetched
example:
the
state
had
--
the
county
coroner
had
determined
that
because
of
the
extraordinary
similarity
between
the
murder
of
a
woman
in
the
neighborhood
--
very
close
by
the
night
before
and
this
one,
including
the
very
peculiar
puncture
injuries,
the
coroner's
report
in
the
state's
file
said
this
is
very
likely
the
same
perpetrator.
the
state
has
identified
the
perpetrator
of
that
other
crime.
and
we
don't
know
whether
even
at
this
day
the
state
has
matched
that
perpetrator's
fingerprints
with
the
fingerprints
that
were
discovered
next
to
the
victim
in
this
case.
and
it
wouldn't
be
far-fetched
to
say
that
in
a
case
involving
either
brady
--
may
i
finish,
it
will
just
be
this
sentence
--
brady
or
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
if
the
fingerprint
evidence
did
link
up
in
that
way,
it
certainly
would
go
into
the
habeas
judge's
evaluation
of
the
merits
of
those
claims.
