justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
have
a
fixed
meaning.
i
mean
wouldn't
you
think
--
i
suspect
the
answer
is
you
do
think
--
that
--
a
district
judge
has
a
lot
of
power
in
many,
many
areas
and
in
one
of
those
areas
some
district
judge
sometimes
could
make
a
horrendous
mistake
that
really
wrecks
a
case,
and
in
such
a
matter
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
sees
a
really
horrendous
error
will
probably
have
the
authority
to
say
you
went
beyond
whatever
standard
applies,
at
least
here,
at
least
--
okay,
we
agree
on
that
one.
so
they
use
some
words,
"effectiveness"
and
whatever
the
words
are,
"interest
of
justice",
just
to
reflect
that
fact.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
think
what
happens.
and
your
complaint
is
he
didn't
abuse
his
--
he
didn't
really
abuse
anything,
he
made
a
good
decision,
the
district
judge.
isn't
that
what
that
comes
down
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
important?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
what's
bothering
you
is
the
way
they
applied
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
applied
it
in
circumstances
that
you
think
--
the
district
judge
actually,
his
decision
was
fine.
you
don't
have
the
power
to
set
that
aside
because
it
was
within
--
it's
within
the
scope
of
any
kind
of
standard
you
want
to
call
it,
including
calling
it
"interest
of
justice".
am
i
right
in
thinking
that,
that
that's
really
your
concern?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
really
want
us
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
record
of
the
case,
go
through
it,
and
say,
here,
whatever
words
you
want
to
use,
the
district
court
acted
in
his
discretion
in
saying
don't
change
the
counsel?
is
that
what
i'm
supposed
to
do?
i'm
trying
to
get
at
what
you
want
me
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
didn't
mean
literally
"whatever
words
you
use".
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
want
me
to
do.
one
is
to
go
back
and
search
all
the
cases
that
use
some
words
for
a
standard,
which,
as
you
can
tell,
i'm
reluctant
to
think
that
that
is
meaningful
in
this
case.
the
other
is
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
if
he
acted
within
what
you
would
normally
think
of
as
the
district
court's
discretionary
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
ninth
circuit
--
i
see
--
i
think
i
see
what
they
were
trying
to
get
at.
they
want
--
they
don't
see
anything
practical
here
to
do
except
to
try
to
get
the
judge,
the
district
judge,
to
focus
on
the
question
of
whether
the
petition
should
be
amended
to
assert
this
kind
of
claim
about
the
new
physical
evidence;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
they
were
trying
to
go.
okay.
now,
suppose
you
lose
this
case.
suppose
they
were
to
say
--
suppose
this
court
said,
well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
that
district
judge
was
operating
within
his
authority
in
saying
that
this
counsel
can
continue
to
represent
him.
we
know
subsequently
relations
broke
down
and
now
there
is
a
new
counsel.
all
right?
can't
the
new
counsel
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
say,
judge,
we
would
like
to
amend
the
petition
so
that
you
will
consider,
you
know,
whether
it
should
be
amended
to
include
this
physical
evidence
claim?
couldn't
he
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
you
answered
this,
but
i
can't
remember
the
answer.
what
happened
when
he
filed
the
60(b)?
did
they
amend
the
petition
or
did
they
consider
the
thing
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
no
--
so
in
other
words
--
what
the
ninth
circuit
in
my
view
is
trying
to
do
is
they've
worked
out
some
complicated
way
of
trying
to
get
the
district
court
to
consider
the
motion
about
the
new
physical
evidence.
and
if
that's
right,
then
unless
you
--
there
is
no
way
to
get
there.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there
under
the
law.
that's
my
--
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd
just
like
to
know
what
he's
thinking.
