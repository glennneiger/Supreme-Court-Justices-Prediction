justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
can
you
remind
me
of
what
the
outcome
of
that
testing
was?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
as
i
read
your
briefs,
i
think
you're
making,
perhaps,
two
different
arguments.
and
i
want
to
focus
you
in
on
which
one
you
are
really
concentrating
on.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is,
this
presentation
seems
to
be
that,
regardless
of
what
standard
we
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
review
of
what
the
district
court
did
in
denying
the
motion
to
substitute
counsel,
that
it
was
wrong.
and
i
presume
that
means
it
was
wrong
for
the
standard
you
are
proposing
and
it
was
wrong
for
the
interest
of
justice
standard,
am
i
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
assuming
an
interest
of
justice
standard
because
that's
the
one
they
invoked,
they
said
what
happened
here
is
that
the
district
court
didn't
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
itself
exactly
what
the
dispute
was
about,
and
so
it
was
a
process
failure,
basically
is
what
they're
saying.
now,
you
make
assumptions
based
on
matters
that
have
come
up
since
that
hearing
about
what
the
dispute
was
about
and
--
but
i
still
don't
know
what
the
federal
defender's
position
was
as
to
whether
or
not
communications
had
broken
down
with
the
client
to
a
point
where
they
thought,
as
they
did
on
appeal,
that
they
couldn't
continue.
so,
tell
me
why,
assuming
we
accept
that
an
interest
of
justice
standard
applies,
the
circuit
court
has
no
power
or
applied
it
improperly
by
saying
--
forget
about
the
remedy
--
has
no
power
to
say,
district
court
judges,
you
have
to
at
a
minimum
inquire
and
set
forth
your
reasons
based
on
the
facts
of
that
inquiry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
"i
think
they
are
doing
a
good?
"
"i
mean,
it
--
it
could
well
be
that
the
judge
later
decides,
after
he
hears
from
the
federal
defender,
i
don't
think
that
--
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
to
be
done,
he
disagrees.
"
"but
he
really
never
got
an
explanation
from
the
federal
defenders.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
never
got
an
explanation
from
the
federal
defenders.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
familiar
with
3599(e),
aren't
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
requires
counsel
to
participate
in
subsequent
proceedings.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of
a
certain
type
and
limited.
is
it
your
position
that
if
there
is
a
complete
breakdown
of
communications
with
an
attorney,
post
habeas
decision,
that
that
is
inadequate
in
the
interest
of
justice
or
otherwise
for
a
court
to
say,
that
could
implicate
proceedings
after
3599,
so
i
should
substitute
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
but
you
are
presuming
you
are
going
to
win.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
presuming
you
are
going
to
win.
i
think
3599
applies
to
situations
in
which
the
habeas
petitioner
wins
a
remand
or
otherwise
has
something
that's
going
to
follow
the
habeas
decision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
is
sort
of
a
made-up
standard.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
point
to
one
case
in
which
this
standard
has
been
used
by
any
district
court
or
court
of
appeals?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
point
to
any
inquiry
by
congress
in
which
such
a
test
was
discussed,
considered
in
any
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
so
what
you're
suggesting
is
in
noncapital
cases,
which
are
less
serious,
you
are
going
to
have
a
higher
bar
for
a
right
that
the
statute
gives
a
judge
without
any
limitation.
the
capital
limitation
is
that
the
judge
on
its
own
motion
or
a
motion
by
defendant
can
substitute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
about
a
standard
that
the
courts
are
used
to
and
one
that
has
a
basis
in
congress's
choice,
like
interest
of
justice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
i
give
you
an
example?
beginning
of
the
litigation,
all
right?
capital
counsel
is
appointed.
capital
counsel
wants
to
raise
challenges
to
the
conviction
and
sentence,
and
defendant
says:
i
don't
--
i
want
to
die.
is
the
district
court
entitled
to
substitute
that
counsel
under
your
theory?
because
you
said
to
me
it
has
to
be
counsel
that's
--
that
counsel
that
has
abandoned
the
client.
counsel
doesn't
want
to
abandon
the
client,
counsel
wants
to
prosecute
the
case.
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest.
counsel's
not
representing
anybody
else.
and
what
was
your
third
criteria?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
this
is
seth
waxman,
sitting
right
next
to
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
suspect
that's
the
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
beginning
of
the
case,
first
decision,
and
defendant
comes
in
and
says:
substitute
my
attorney.
what
would
be
your
argument
under
your
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
are
some
decisions
that
the
client
controls?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not
abandonment.
that's
an
error.
that's
a
problem.
but
it's
not
abandonment
under
your
definition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
i
tell
my
attorney,
follow
these
leads,
that's
a
failure
of
an
agent
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
given
my
example,
isn't
it
the
case
that
under
the
interest
of
justice
standard
there
will
be
situations
in
which
a
substitution
like
the
one
i
just
posited
would
be
right,
that
wouldn't
be
right
under
your
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
for
noncapital
defendants
congress
chose
to
give
them
more
rather
than
less?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are
saying
capital
have
lesser
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
delay
one
of
the
factors
that
courts
routinely
look
at
under
the
interest
of
justice
standard?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
point
that,
even
under
the
interest
of
justice
standard,
you
are
claiming
there
was
an
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mister--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
has
to
go
with
the
scope
of
the
remedy
that
they
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming,
as
i
do
and
you
just
said,
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
there
is
--
he
should
have
gotten
a
reason,
an
explanation,
but
now
there
is
a
new
attorney
anyway,
so
what
do
we
do,
isn't
the
normal
thing
to
do
just
to
remand
it,
to
let
the
district
court
decide
what
steps
it
wants
to
take,
including
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
have
granted
the
motion
for
substitution
if
it
had
heard
the
explanation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning,
there
was
a
new
judge.
but,
that
doesn't
--
a
new
judge
is
never
stopped
from
considering
what
has
happened
in
the
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
to
decide
whether
under
the
facts
as
they
existed
at
the
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
academic.
it
wasn't
academic
for
the
judge
below,
the
new
judge--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
say,
what
happened
back
then;
i
don't
believe
the
motion
was
timely;
i
don't
believe
that
you
were
foreclosed
from
doing
other
things;
motion
to
substitute
would
have
been
denied;
end
of
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
us
whether
that
testing
has
been
done
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
no,
you
don't
think
it
has
been?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
appendix.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
then
your
answer
is
yes,
mr.
goh's
prints
don't
match
the
prints
found
in
the
file.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
worry
your
prosecutor's
office?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
fingerprints
that
were
found
at
the
scene
of
this
crime
matched
goh,
that
wouldn't
give
you
pause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
hasn't
the
test
been
done?
