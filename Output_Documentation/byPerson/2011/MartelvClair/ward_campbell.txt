mr.
ward
a.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
12
years,
mr.
clair's
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
was
litigated
in
the
federal
district
court
in
front
of
the
same
federal
district
court
judge.
his
petition
raised
39
challenges
to
his
guilt
and
penalty,
and
the
judge
oversaw
years
of
discovery,
presided
over
a
2-day
evidentiary
hearing,
and
received
extensive
briefing.
when
the
case
was
under
submission,
mr.
clair
sent
a
letter
to
the
judge
expressing
dissatisfaction
with
his
team
of
attorneys
from
the
federal
public
defender's
office,
and
requested
that
they
be
replaced.
the
judge
asked
both
sides'
counsel
for
their
position
on
clair's
complaint.
the
federal
public
defender
responded
that,
after
conferring
with
their
client,
mr.
clair
was
willing
to
continue
with
them
for
that
point.
the
court
then
stated
it
would
take
no
further
action.
3
months
later,
just
before
the
court
was
to
issue
its
decision
in
the
case,
clair
complained
again.
the
court
issued
a
written
order--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
only
way
to
be
sure
was
the
fact
that
at
some
point,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
judge
had
announced
the
day
he
would
be
retiring,
which
would
be
june
30th
of
2005.
so,
there's
probably
an
inference
there
that
it
could
be
expected
that
the
decision
was
going
to
be
coming
out
by
the
end
of
the
--
end
of
june
2005.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
there
was
an
initial
deadline
set
for
the
filing
of
the
briefing,
post-evidentiary
hearing
briefing,
and
there
would
be
no
extensions
of
time.
subsequently,
there
was
in
fact
another
submission
by
mr.
clair
in
may
of
2005
with
some
additional
declarations.
the
court
accepted
those
declarations,
but
made
it
clear
it
would
accept
no
additional
submissions
in
the
case
unless
it
ordered
otherwise,
that
it
would
proceed
with
the
decision.
once
upon
--
anyway,
in
june,
june
16th,
2005,
mr.
clair
sent
a
second
complaint
about
his
counsel
again,
and
the
district
court
issued
a
written
order
denying
that
request,
finding
that
clair's
counsel
was
doing
a
proper
job
and
did
not
appear
to
have
a
conflict
of
interest.
the
district
court
had
an
excellent
factual
basis
for
that
conclusion
because
it
had
just
concluded
work
on
its
extensive
order
denying
the
petition
in
mr.
clair's
case.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
what
mr.
clair's
complaint
indicated,
there
was
some
additional
physical
evidence
that
had
not
been
examined
or
investigated
before.
he
indicated
that
the
federal
public
defender
actually
had
met
with
the
orange
county
law
enforcement
about
the
evidence,
and
he
was
upset
that
there
was
no
further
action
being
taken
by
the
federal
public
defender
regarding
testing,
seeking
dna
testing
or
testing
of
that
evidence.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that's
correct.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
the
status
of
that
litigation:
once
the
--
the
petition
was
denied,
mr.
clair
filed
a
notice
--
there
was
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
by
the
federal
public
defender.
mr.
clair
also
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
because
of
the
denial
of
his
substitution
motion.
those
were
merged
together.
mr.
clair
was
appointed
new
counsel.
the
new
counsel
then
filed
a
rule
--
a
rule
--
a
request
to
the
district
court
to
entertain
a
rule
60(b)
motion,
which
the
district
court
denied.
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
that
the
district
court
consider
the
rule
60(b)
motion.
the
district
court
heard
the
rule
60(b)
motion
and
then
denied
it.
$mr.
clair
then
filed
a
protective
petition,
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
a
successive
petition,
with
the
ninth
circuit,
and
has
also
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
there
--
there
had
been
--
there
has
been
some
testing
of
the
evidence
during
--
during
that
time
by
the
orange
county
law
enforcement
in
regards
to
its
relationship
to
the
crime,
or
its
relationship
to
another
crime
that
occurred
at
that
time,
which
i
think
that
information
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--the
--
the
outcome
of
--
of
the
testing
is
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
testing
was
done
to
see
if
the
--
there
was
any
dna
matching
between
the
other
murder
that
had
occurred
a
couple
days
before
and
the
murder
of
ms.
rodgers
--
let's
see
if
i
can
say
this
succinctly.
the
--
there
was
--
there
was
no
matching
of
mr.
clair's
dna
with
anything
from
the
murder
scene
of
the
rodgers
murder,
and
there
was
no
matching
of
any
dna
that
was
found
for
the
perpetrator
of
the
other
murder
at
the
site
of
ms.
rodgers'
murder.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
okay.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
i
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
under
any
standard
that
would
apply,
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
ninth
circuit's
disposition
is
incorrect.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes.
and
the
reason
is
that,
looking
at
the
record
and
what
was
presented
to
the
federal
district
court
at
the
time
it
received
the
request
by
mr.
clair
in
june
of
2005,
what
mr.
clair's
allegation
was
was
that
he
disagreed
with
the
investigative,
tactical,
strategic
decisions
that
were
being
made
by
the
federal
public
defender.
that
--
that
was
the
reason
that
was
in
mr.
clair's
--
mr.
clair's
allegation.
those
premises,
even--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--i'm
sorry--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--your
honor,
it
in
fact
--
it
would
be
--
it's
appropriate
--
if
the
record
--
if
the
allegations
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
and
the
record
before
the
court
is
sufficient
for
the
court
to
make
the
finding
that
there
is
in
fact
no
basis
for
substitution,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
conduct
an
inquiry
or
a
hearing
or
to
initiate
other
further
process
in
the
case;
and
the
allegation
here
which
went
to
the
physical
evidence
in
the
case
from
the
standpoint
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
way
this
case
is
prosecuted,
and
the
evidence
of
mr.
clair's
guilt,
the
fact
that
there
was
additional
physical
evidence
that
might
be
available,
simply
wouldn't
have
supported
any
cognizable
claims
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
action.
there
was
no
need
for
any
further
investigation
or
inquiry
on
the
part
of
the
court
based
on
what
was
presented
to
it
at
the
time.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
there
i
have
to
--
i
think
i
have
to
take
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
in
its
opinion
about
this
case,
which
is
what
we
have
here
is
physical
evidence
that
could
be
subject
to
forensic
testing
now
that
was
not
available
in
1987.
so
the
fact
that
there
might
be
later
--
there
might
have
been
developments
in
forensic
techniques
since
1987
when
mr.
clair's
trial
occurred,
doesn't
support
any
claim
of
trial
error
back
in
1987.
you
can't
show
any
prejudice
from
any
--
from
any
failure
back
in
1987
because
the
testing
wasn't
available
to
do
that
they
now
want
to
do.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
an
actual
innocence
claim,
i
think
to
begin
with,
it
wouldn't
be
clear,
based
on
this
court's
jurisprudence
at
the
time,
that
a
factual
innocence
claim
would
be
cognizable
in
this
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
it
would
be
a
--
this
court
has
indicated
to
the
--
has
never
really
actually
held
that
that
is
a
cognizable
claim.
even
if
it
--
it
did,
it
wouldn't
be
an
exhausted,
it
would
certainly
be
an
unexhausted
claim.
california
in
fact
does
entertain
that
type
of
claim,
does
provide
a
state
avenue
for
that
type
of
claim.
there
is
plenty
of
reasons
why
you
would
not
raise
that
claim
at
this
point,
especially
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
the
first
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
actually,
your
honor,
yes,
it
is.
at
that
point
the
defendant
has,
of
course,
already
gone
through
the
trial,
the
state
appeal,
and
the
state
habeas
process,
as
--
particularly
at
the
state
trial
and
the
state
appellate
process,
of
course,
the
standard
for
substitution
of
counsel
is
the
potential
total
breakdown
of
communications,
the
irreconcilable
conflict,
conflict
of
interest.
by
the
time
you've
gone
through
the
entire
process
by
which
you
have
gone
through
the
state
trial,
you
have
exhausted
your
claims
in
state
court--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--excuse
me?
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
point
is
is
that
by
the
time
you
have
reached
that
juncture,
in
which
the
claims
have
been
raised
and
litigated
multiple
times
in
multiple
forums,
that
the
need
for
the
type
of
communication
and
contact
that
occurs
at
the
trial
and
state
appellate
level
is
not
as
essential
or
necessary
at
that
juncture.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes,
he
would
have,
especially
given
that
the
case
at
that
point
was
completely
under
submission
and
simply
awaiting
for
decision.
at
that
point
there
is
in
fact
no
more
litigation
to
be
occurring,
the
--
whatever
the
problem
with
communication
is
at
that
point
is
not
going
to
in
any
way
adversely
affect
the
--
the
representation.
the
case
is
over.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that
--
that
is
correct.
i
mean,
if
--
yes.
that
--
that
is
an
extra
fact
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
pivotal
fact
as
far
as
what
the
district
court
has
done
as
far
as
exercising
its
direction
--
its
discretion
in
june
when
it
received
the
complaint
from
mr.
--
mr.
clair.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
when
the
--
when
the
allegation
is
made
that
--
by
the
petitioner
that
he
has,
in
fact,
been
denied
what
he
is
entitled
to
under
3599,
which
is
the
appointment
and
representation
by
counsel
qualified
under
that
statute.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
the
--
the
inquiry
--
the
inquiry
would
occur
when
an
allegation
was
made
that,
for
whatever
reason,
the
counsel
does
not
meet
the
qualifications
that
are
expected
to
be
met,
the
counsel
has
a
adverse
conflict
of
interest,
or
counsel
has
basically
reached
a
point
where
he
is
no
longer
representing
or
acting
as
an
advocate
for--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--i
think
in
the
context
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
action,
that
is
in
fact
--
in
which
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
counsel
--
that
is
in
fact
the
interest
--
where
the
interest
of
justice
standard
would
be.
the
interest
of--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--no--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--no,
i
cannot.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
no,
i
cannot.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
it's
actually
analogous
to
the
way
this
court
over
the
years
has
divided
up
the
jurisprudence
regarding
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
the
dividing
line
between
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
claims
of
denial
of
counsel.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
no,
we're
not
in
the
context
of
a
noncapital
habeas.
there
has
never
been
any
construction,
certainly
by
this
court,
of
what
"interest
of
justice"
means
in
the
context
of
substitution
of
counsel,
of
a
statutory
counsel,
in
the
context
of
either
capital
or
noncapital
habeas.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
actually,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
in
fact,
to
the
extent
we
are
analogizing
to
what
this
court
has
long
done
as
far
as
dividing
question
of
sixth
amendment
claims
between
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
denial
of
counsel.
we
are
in
fact
submitting
a
concept
that
is
actually
very
familiar
to
this
court
and
very
similar
to
what
this
court
deals
with
in
many
sixth
amendment
claims.
we
are
simply
looking
at
it
in
the
context
now
of
the
fact
that
you
have
been
given
or
entitled,
a
statutory
entitlement
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
you
are
entitled
to
protect
that
right
to
the
extent
to
vindicate
that
particular
right,
which
is
to
be
appointed
that
counsel.
if
you
are
denied
that
right,
then
you
in
fact
have
a
legitimate
reason
to
ask
for
new
counsel,
for
new
counsel
to
be
appointed.
the
interest
of
justice
standard
doesn't
have
a
fixed
meaning,
really,
in
any
context.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that
is
certainly
an
aspect
of
the
complaint.
but
to
us
what's
very
important--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--what
is
important
here
is
that
the
premise
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
that
it
would
be
an
acceptable
motion
for
substitution
for
the
--
for
mr.
clair
to
complain
or
allege
disagreements
with
his
counsel
about--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--well--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--yes,
our
concern,
your
honor,
is
that
the
premise
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
--
goes
to
what
the
appropriate
standard,
what
the
appropriate
level
of
complaint,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--yes,
that
is
--
yes.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
confusion
here--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--i
think
the
confusion
here
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
started
out
by
borrowing
the
phrase
"interest
of
justice"
and
inserting
it
into
a
section
where
--
where
it
was
not
inserted,
and
it
would
appear
to
be
a
deliberate
act
of
congress
to
do
that,
and
then
it
gave
it
a
meaning
which
we
think
under
any
circumstances
would
be
inappropriate
in
this
context.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
abuse
of
discretion
--
if
the
court
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
of
course,
it
automatically
--
i
mean,
that
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
our
feeling
here
about
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
that
the
way
it
has
defined
what
would
be
appropriate
in
terms
of
a
motion
for
a
substitution
and
what
would
trigger
an
inquiry
by
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
law
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
this
case.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
well,
your
honor,
the
substance
--
if
we
want
to
call
it
an
interest
of
justice
standard,
the
substance
of
it
would
be
that
it
would
not
be
--
substitution
would
not
be
--
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
move
for
substitution
on
the
basis
of
disagreements
with
counsel
about
tactical
or
investigative
decisions,
such
as
mr.
clair
did
here.
the
appropriate
standard
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
actual
denial
of
counsel
as
provided
under
section
3599.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
qualifications,
just
the
basic--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--he's
undoubtedly
qualified,
your
honor.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
otherwise
he
wouldn't
have
the
appointment.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
there
are
several
responses
to
that.
at
one
level
the
client
would
always
--
always
has
and
i
think
always
has
basic
decisionmaking
authority
over
basic
decisions,
whether
or
not
a
petition
should
be
filed
or
not
filed,
this
type
of
thing.
so
a
failure
of
an
attorney
to
abide
by
that
particular
instruction
would
in
fact
be
a
failure--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--there
have
always
been
some
basic
decisions
the
client
makes
in
any,
in
any
case.
but
it's
not--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--it
is
in
fact
the
failure
of
the
lawyer
to
truly
act
as
an
agent
for
the
client
at
that
point.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
it's
actually,
though
--
that
is
in
fact
normally
always
considered
to
be
an
area
that's
within
the
domain
of
the
attorney.
those
types
of
investigative
tactical
decisions
have
always
been
decisions
that
attorneys
have
normally
made
for
their
clients
and
not
necessarily
under
the
control
of
their
clients.
but
let
me
tell
you
about
the
volunteer
situation,
as
a
practical
matter.
the
volunteer
situation
is
a
whole
--
almost
a
whole
separate
category
of
litigation
from
the
kind
of
litigation
we
are
talking
about.
what
normally
happens
in
those
cases
is
counsel
is
not
substituted;
usually
frequently
a
second
counsel
is
brought
in
to
deal
with
representing
the
client
on
those
particular
issues,
and
the
first
counsel
remains.
so
that's
become--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--a
volunteer
issue
is
when
someone
says:
i
do
not
want
to
pursue
my
remedies,
i
want
to
simply
be
executed.
in
the
practice
we
call
that
a
volunteer.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
we
call
that
a
volunteer.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
that's
the
normal
term
of
art.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
your
honor,
i
think
that
actually
our
standard
would
cover
what
is
appropriate
for
protecting
the
defendant's
statutory
right
to
counsel,
and
that--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--no,
not
at
all.
i
don't
think
noncapital
or
capital
habeas
petitioners
have
any
greater,
have
any
greater
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
my
guess
--
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
drawn
a
categorical
difference
between
them
in
terms
of
what
rights
are
available
to
them
for
purposes
of
representation
by
counsel.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
yes.
and
i
--
once
again,
any
motion
for
substitution,
no
matter
what
standard
you
use,
should
be
made
promptly.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
absolutely.
oh,
yes.
yes.
we
would
submit
even
under
that
standard
it
would
be
an
error.
your
honor,
unless
there
is
any
more
questions--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
no,
i
don't
believe
that
testing
has
been
done.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
no,
i
don't.
i
don't.
the
testing
has
not
been
done.
the
only
testing
i
am
aware
of
is
the
testing
that's
discussed
in
the
appendix.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
which
excluded
mr.
goh,
who
apparently
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
other
murderer,
from
having
any
dna
at
the
scene
of
the
rodgers
murder.
and
mr.
goh
is
dead
now,
so--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--we
--
i
am
not
aware
--
the
answer
is,
i
am
not
--
there
has
been
no
test
comparison
of
the
fingerprints
of
mr.
goh,
to
my
--
to
my
knowledge,
in
with
the
--
what
was
found
at
the
rodgers
murder.
the
only
testing
that
we
have
is
the
testing
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
opposition
to
cert
regarding
the
dna
comparisons
that
were
done.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
i
think
that
the
problems
that
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
the
prosecutor's
office,
the
--
nothing
that
could
be
found
about
this
case
would
undercut
the
fact
that
mr.
clair--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--it
would
--
it
would
certainly
be
a
--
it
would
certainly
--
i
think
it
would
give
them
pause.
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
give
them
pause,
but
the
fact
is--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--i
don't
know
why
the
testing
has
not
been
done.
but
whatever
the
testing
would
be,
the
fact
is,
mr.
clair
made
numerous
admissions
and
numerous
statements
implicating
himself
in
the
murder
of
linda
--
ms.
rodgers
during
the
taped
conversation
that
he
had
with
ms.
flores,
which
also
corroborated
ms.
flores'
testimony
about
his
involvement
in
that
murder.
and
that
is
the
critical
--
the
critical
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
the
california
supreme
court,
which
has
had
this
information
in
front
of
it,
has
also
in
fact
denied
already
a
petition
based
on
the
available
evidence
about
the
murders.
i
think
also
if
you
look--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--no,
not
based
on
that
state's
statement.
the
state's
statements
are
filled
with
implied
--
implied
admissions
about
what
he
did
with
the
jewelry,
about
trying
to
evade
her
questions
about
the
case,
to
do
anything
to
try
to
avoid
having
to
really
confront
himself
directly
with
involvement
in
the
case.
it's
a
--
it
really
is
a
very
damning
--
damning
tape--
mr.
ward
a.
campbell
--well,
i
think
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
tape
--
she
testified,
and
the
tape
corroborates
her
testimony.
so
in
fact,
what
you
have
is
--
you
--
you
have
mutual
reinforcement.
