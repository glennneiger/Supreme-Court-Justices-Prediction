justice
elena
kagan
if
i
understand
your
answers
to
some
of
these
questions,
you
are
not
at
all
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
district
court
had
made
this
decision
2
months
earlier.
you
think
that
the
answer
would
be
the
same
had
the
district
court
not
made
an
inquiry
2
months
earlier;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
so
when
is
a
district
court
required
to
engage
in
some
kind
of
inquiry?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
--
i
was,
again
assuming
as
justice
sotomayor
was,
that
if
we're
in
an
interest
of
justice
world,
if
that's
the
appropriate
standard,
when
is
the
district
--
when
does
the
district
court
have
to
make
an
inquiry,
and
what
kind
of
inquiry
does
he
have
to
make?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you're
--
i
thought
that
that
test
was
an
alternative
to
the
interest
of
justice
standard.
i
am
positing
that
the
interest
of
justice
standard
applies
and
you
are
giving
me
back
those
same
three
factors.
do
you
think
that
that
is
all
the
interest
of
justice
standard
is
about?
justice
elena
kagan
isn't
he
always--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
waxman,
what--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
waxman--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
you
are
suggesting,
mr.
waxman,
that
he
did
not
have
to
make
an
inquiry
in
every
case,
is
that
right?
you
are
not
saying
that.
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
--
when
does
a
person
have
to
make
an
inquiry?
justice
elena
kagan
what
in
this
case
required
an
inquiry
on
the
judge's
part?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
this
goes
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
but
suppose
the
judge
says
to
himself,
even
if
the
response
comes
in,
yes,
relations
are
terrible
because
the
client
wants
the
lawyers
to
--
to
investigate
a
particular
thing
and
the
lawyers
don't
want
to
investigate
that
thing,
the
judge
knows,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
either
way,
because
he
is
ready
to
issue
his
opinion.
and
further
investigation
of
this
evidence
is
not
going
to
change
his
mind
as
to
any
material
issue.
why
should
the
judge
not
reject
the
motion?
justice
elena
kagan
does
your
argument--
justice
elena
kagan
--did
--
does
your
argument
depend
on
a
notion
that
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
was
weak?
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
great
deal
of
evidence
against
the
defendant,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument,
that
the
judge
still
had
a
duty
to
inquire?
or
are
you
asking
us
essentially
to
make
a
determination
that
this
was
an
iffy
case
to
begin
with?
justice
elena
kagan
a
federal
statute
called
section
3599
entitles
indigent
defendants
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
capital
cases,
including
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
sometimes
the
attorney-client
relationship
sours
and
the
defendant
may
then
ask
the
court
to
replace
his
appointed
lawyer.
in
this
case
we
consider
how
a
court
should
decide
such
a
substitution
motion.
we
adopt
the
standard
that
kenneth
clair,
the
habeas
petitioner
here
suggests,
but
we
still
find
that
the
trial
court
acted
within
its
discretion
in
denying
his
request
for
a
new
lawyer.
clair
was
convicted
of
murder
in
california
state
court
and
sentenced
to
death.
in
1993,
he
received
federally
appointed
counsel
so
that
he
could
bring
a
habeas
challenge
to
his
conviction
and
sentence.
for
some
years,
the
case
followed
the
normal
course.
his
lawyers
filed
a
habeas
petition.
the
district
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
august
2004
and
by
february
2005
the
parties
had
wrapped
up
their
briefing.
but
in
march
2005,
clair
wrote
to
the
court
to
ask
for
new
counsel
alleging
that
his
attorneys
were
trying
only
to
reverse
his
death
sentence
and
not
to
prove
his
innocence.
the
court
asked
for
further
information
about
the
problem.
following
that
inquiry,
clair
met
with
his
lawyers
and
decided
that
he
wanted
them
to
continue
to
represent
him
after
all.
the
court
accordingly
said
it
would
take
no
action
on
his
old
request.
but
just
six
weeks
later,
clair
again
asked
for
new
counsel.
in
his
second
letter,
clair
repeated
his
earlier
allegations
and
added
a
new
one
that
his
lawyers
were
refusing
to
investigate
newly
located
physical
evidence
from
the
crime
scene.
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
the
district
court
denied
clair's
second
request
for
a
new
lawyer
without
making
further
inquiry
at
the
same
time,
as
they
denied
his
habeas
petition.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
by
denying
clair's
second
substitution
motion
without
inquiring
further
into
his
complaints.
our
opinion
first
considers
the
standard
that
courts
should
apply
in
considering
capital
habeas
petitioner's
motions
to
substitute
counsel.
oddly,
the
relevant
statute
that
was
section
3599
just
doesn't
answer
this
question.
it
says
that
a
person
in
clair's
shoes
may
move
for
new
counsel,
but
it
does
not
specify
how
a
court
is
to
decide
that
motion.
clair
argues
that
a
court
should
grant
a
substitution
motion
when
doing
so
is
in
the
interests
of
justice.
that
standard
comes
from
another
federal
statute,
section
3006a
which
today
governs
the
appointment
and
substitution
of
counsel
in
non-capital
cases.
by
contrast,
the
state
here
argues
that
a
court
may
substitute
counsel
only
when
the
appointed
lawyer
has
effectively
stopped
representing
his
client.
and
that
is
so,
the
state
claims
even
if
the
attorney-client
relationship
has
badly
deteriorated
and
a
new
lawyer
can
be
substituted
without
significant
delay.
we
think
that
on
this
question,
clair
is
right.
our
analysis
looks
to
the
history
of
section
3599.
prior
to
that
statute's
adoption,
section
3006a
governs
the
appointment
and
substitution
of
counsel
in
all
cases,
both
capital
and
non-capital
and
section
3006a,
as
i
just
noted,
provided
that
courts
should
decide
substitution
motions
in
the
interests
of
justice.
in
1988,
congress
enacted
section
3599
as
a
kind
of
spin-off
which
would
apply
only
to
capital
cases.
the
new
statute
in
a
whole
raft
of
ways
enhanced
the
quality
of
representation
that
people
face
the
death
penalty
received,
in
recognition
of
the
complexity
of
those
cases
and
the
seriousness
of
the
penalty
involved.
given
this
context,
we
cannot
accept
the
state's
view
that
section
3599
made
it
more
difficult
for
capital
defendants
and
habeas
petitioners
to
replace
their
attorneys.
we
think
instead
that
under
section
3599,
the
familiar
interests
of
justice
standard
applies
in
capital
cases
just
as
it
did
before
and
just
as
it
does
today
in
non-capital
litigation,
but
we
do
not
think
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
under
that
statute
when
it
denied
clair's
second
substitution
motion.
in
almost
all
cases,
a
judge
must
make
an
inquiry
into
a
motion
of
this
kind
to
figure
out
why
a
defendant
thinks
he
needs
a
new
attorney,
but
here,
the
district
court
received
clair's
letter
on
the
eve
of
deciding
his
10-year-old
habeas
petition
after
telling
the
parties
that
it
would
not
accept
any
further
submissions
in
the
case
including
any
amendments
to
clair's
habeas
petition
based
on
the
new
physical
evidence.
in
these
circumstances,
a
change
in
lawyer
could
not
have
made
any
difference
in
the
district
court.
because
the
habeas
litigation
was
well
and
truly
over
there
we
think
the
court
acted
within
its
discretion
in
summarily
denying
clair's
second
substitution
motion.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
