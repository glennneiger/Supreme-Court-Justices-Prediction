well,
but
abuse
of
discretion
doesn't
mean
that
the
judge
operates
in
a
vacuum.
if
we
make
--
issue
an
opinion
and
say,
oh,
well,
the
standard
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
that
doesn't
tell
people
too
much.
abuse
of
discretion
based
on
what
standards,
what
inquiries?
and
that's
--
i
would
like
to
know
what
your
position
is
on
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
it's
going
to
be
something
very
close
to
interest
of
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
know
what
was
in
his
thought
processes,
mr.
waxman,
because
14
days
later
he
issued
a
60
or
61-page
opinion
with
--
dealing
with
47
different
claims,
many
of
which,
many
of
which,
related
to
actual
innocence,
which
was
the
gravamen
of
the
letter
of
the
complaint
on
the
16th.
so
you
--
you
can't
consider
the
letter
just
in
isolation
from
the
61-page
opinion
that's
issued
16
days
later.
