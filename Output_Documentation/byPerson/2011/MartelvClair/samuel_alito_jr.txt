justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
has
been
some
additional
litigation
regarding
this
physical
evidence
since
this
--
the
time
of
--
of
the
unsuccessful
substitution
request,
hasn't
there
been?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
tell
us
what
has
happened
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
could
you
tell
us
what
has
us
what
has
happened
with
that
litigation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
--
what
has
happened
there?
was
there
--
was
there
testing
of
this
evidence
in
connection
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
a
--
a
possible
brady
claim?
is
there
a
disagreement
about
whether
this
physical
evidence
could
have
been
tested
at
the
--
and
revealed
anything
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
an
actual
innocence
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
would
be
pretty
incredible.
maybe
that's
what's
required.
why
isn't
this
is
a
fair
reading
of
what
judge
taylor
did?
as
of
april
29th,
as
i
recall,
there
was
not
a
problem
with
the
representation.
and
the
decision
was
made
on
june
30th.
now,
on
june
16th,
that's
the
time
when
clair
sent
his
letter.
by
this
point,
the
petition
had
been
pending
for
a
long
time
before
the
judge.
the
judge
presumably
was
approaching
the
point
where
he
was
going
to
issue
his
decision.
he
saw
the
letter.
he
could
not
see
any
way
in
which
the
matters
that
were
discussed
in
the
letters
could
lead
to
a
claim
that
would
go
anywhere.
as
to
the
physical
evidence,
if
it
couldn't
have
been
tested
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
would
not
have
been
a
brady
obligation,
and
an
actual
innocence
claim
here
would
be
quite
far-fetched
in
light
of
the
very
incriminating
statements
that
--
that
mr.
clair
made
in
the
tape
recorded
conversation.
had
he
substituted
counsel,
he
would
not
have
been
under
an
obligation,
i
think,
to
allow
substituted
counsel
to
amend
the
petition,
which
had
been
pending
for
a
long
period
of
time.
so
he
said:
counsel
is
doing
a
proper
job;
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
a
conflict
of
interest;
and
i'm
going
to
deny
this.
now,
counsel
could
have
been
appointed
and
in
fact
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
clair
going
forward.
why
isn't
that
a
fair
reading
of
what
he
did?
and
if
so,
what
need
was
there
for
further
inquiry?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
interests
of
justice
is
such
an
open-ended
test.
if
that
is
the
test,
doesn't
it
follow
that
it
will
only
be
in
the
rarest
of
cases
that
a
district
judge
will
have
been
found
--
will
be
found
to
have
abused
his
or
her
discretion
in
denying
a
substitution
request?
why
does
that
very
broad
standard
help
you
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know
you
think
there
should
be
inquiry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
your
time
runs
out,
how
would
the
finger
--
how
would
the
fact
that
there
were
fingerprints
at
the
scene
that
do
not
match
anybody
who
was
known
to
be
in
that
house
have
provided
evidence
for
--
provided
the
basis
for
any
claim
that
could
have
established
mr.
clair's
innocence
at
this
late
--
at
this
late
date,
in
the
face
of
the
other
evidence
that
was
present
in
this
case:
the
recorded
statements?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
defense
counsel
had
introduced
at
trial
fingerprint
evidence
showing
that
10
people
were
present
at
some
point
in
that
house
and
they
weren't
people
who
lived
there.
that's
--
it's
weak
exculpatory
evidence
for
the
defendant
at
best
that
there
were
unknown
people
in
the
house.
it
might
have
been
the
cable
guy.
who
knows
who
they
were?
so
it
doesn't
help
very
much.
