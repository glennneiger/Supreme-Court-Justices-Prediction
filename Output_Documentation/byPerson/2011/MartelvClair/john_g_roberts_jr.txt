chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1265,
martel
v.
clair.
mr.
campbell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
there
some
way
that
clair
knew
that
the
court
was
just
about
to
issue
its
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
you
don't
think
that
the
standard
of
review
is
abuse
of
discretion,
because
if
you
do
then
i
suppose
you
are
assuming
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
whether
to
grant
the
motion
or
not
instead
of
being
confined
by
a
particular
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
last
week
we
get
notice
from
mr.
clair
that
he
is
dissatisfied
with
his
supreme
court
counsel;
that
communication
has
broken
down;
that
you
plan
to
argue
particular
--
present
particular
arguments,
and
he
doesn't
want
you
to
do
that.
do
we
have
an
obligation
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
his
complaint?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
he
says,
i
turned
up
new
evidence,
or
i
think
this
is
a
great
argument,
and
my
counsel
has
told
me
he
is
not
going
to
raise
it,
and
i
want
new
counsel
who
will
raise
this
argument.
will
we
have
to
say
--
look
at
it
and
say,
well,
we
have
to
figure
out
is
that
a
good
argument;
is
it
better
than
the
ones
counsel
are
going
to
raise?
has
communication
broken
down?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
want
to
ask
you
about
that.
you
mention
that
no
fewer
than
six
times
in
your
brief.
what
is
your
point,
that
the
judge
altered
his
disposition
of
a
legal
matter
before
him
for
his
personal
convenience?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
what
is
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
retire?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
you
are
saying
he
violated
his
judicial
oath
for
his
own
personal
convenience,
that
he
failed
to
do
something
that
you
say
he
should
have
done,
because
he
was
retiring?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
do
you
say
six
times
in
your
brief
that
the
judge
was
retiring
the
next
day
or
retired
the
next
day?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
another
judge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
another
judge.
she's
available.
i
have
to
say
it
strikes
me,
frankly,
as
argument
by
innuendo
that
i
think
is
very
unjustified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
still
trying
to
get
to
the
point
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
still
trying
to
get
to
the
point
of
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
he
was
retiring.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
it
go
--
how
does
it
go
to
the
remedy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
was
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
i
understood
you
to
say
you
had
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
finish
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor
and
then
go
back
to
justice
breyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
--
the
interests
of
justice,
does
that
include
the
available
resources
of
the
federal
public
defender?
i
mean,
those
offices
are
notoriously
understaffed.
and
here
you
have
a
situation
where
one
lawyer
has
been
representing
an
individual
for
an
awful
long
time,
and
the
defendant
says,
i
want
a
new
lawyer.
it's
obviously
going
to
take
that
--
a
new
lawyer
away
from
their
work
and
put
them
in
a
position
of
having
to
get
up
to
speed
in
a
new
case.
and
i
just
wonder
if
that's
part
of
this
--
i
won't
call
interest
of
justice
"a
standard
--
it's
an
aspiration.
"
"but
does
that
go
into
the
calculus?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
gets
to
my--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
the
--
is
the
person
in
a
different
position
with
the
new
counsel
than
he
would
have
been
with
the
old
concerning
the
standards
about
reopening
things?
in
other
words,
do
we
say,
well,
what
would
the
old
counsel
have
been
able
to
do
with
respect
to
reopening,
and
say,
well,
that's
all
the
new
counsel
can
do?
in
other
words,
new
counsel
doesn't
allow
you
to
circumvent
the
various--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
restrictions
that
you
just
talked
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
one
of
the
things
i
think
the
district
court
would
do
in
that
situation
with
the
same
counsel
is
say:
look,
this
was
a
tactical
strategic
decision
of
the
lawyer.
you
don't
get
to
reopen
something
because
of
that.
now,
does
that
same
consideration
apply
with
respect
to
the
substituted
counsel,
or
does
the
substituted
counsel
allow
the
defendant
to
get
a
leg
up
on
the
process,
and
make
new
arguments
that
the
old
counsel
couldn't
make?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
campbell,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case,
10-1265,
martel
versus
clair.
