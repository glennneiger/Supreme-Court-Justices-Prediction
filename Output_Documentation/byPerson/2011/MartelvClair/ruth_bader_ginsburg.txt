there
was
a
deadline
set
for
all
submissions,
wasn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
petition
had
something
new,
the
report
that
his
investigator
had
turned
up
this
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
the
public
defender
had
said
to
the
district
court
what
it
said
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
is
that
the
attorney-client
relationship
has
broken
down
to
such
an
extent
that
substitution
would
be
appropriate,
which
wasn't
asked.
but
suppose
the
public
defender
had
given
would
the
district
that
answer
to
the
district
judge.
judge
still
have
rightly
denied
the
motion
for
substitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
you
get
it
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
like
--
mr.
waxman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
i
thought
this
is
a
case
that
has
been
going
on
for,
like,
12
years
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
thought
that
the
basic
disagreement
between
the
client
and
counsel
was
counsel
said:
our
best
shot
is
going
to
be
to
keep
you
alive,
so
we
want
to
do
everything
we
can
to
change
the
death
sentence,
and
then
--
and
we
don't
want
to
detract
from
that
by
making
a
claim
of
actual
innocence
when
the
--
there'd
be
very
slim
basis
for
that.
so,
that's
the
judgment,
and
it's
a
strategic
judgment,
that
counsel
made:
our
best
shot
to
keep
this
man
alive
is
to
concentrate
on
the
penalty
phase.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
that's
what
--
what
he
told
his
girlfriend,
right?
there
is
nothing
else.
there
is
only
that?
