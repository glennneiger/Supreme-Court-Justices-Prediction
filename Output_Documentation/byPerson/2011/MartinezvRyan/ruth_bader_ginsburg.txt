justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
your
main
position
is
right,
then
wouldn't
the
same
go
for
2255
proceedings?
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
it
makes
sense
to
have
the
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
looked
at
by
a
trial
judge
first,
not
an
appellate
judge,
and
yet
in
2255
proceedings,
if
you
are
urging
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
you
don't
get
an
automatic
right
to
counsel.
in
2255
proceedings,
counsel
will
be
appointed
only
if
the
court
determines
that
the
interests
of
justice
so
require.
so
the
proposition
you
are
urging
would
have
ramifications
in
the
federal
system
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
2255
would
no
longer
be
the
interests
of
justice
so
require
because
if
it's
your
first
opportunity
to
raise
the
point
the
court
must
appoint
counsel
for
you.
is
that
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
of
the
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
it
be
excessive
if
it
could
not
have
been
raised
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
permitted
this
counsel
to
raise
a
claim
that
could
not
have
been
raised
on
the
direct
appeal,
is
the
counsel
limited
to
that
point,
or
can
the
counsel
representing
the
client
bring
up
other
things?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
could
it
be
that
the
counsel
could
also
bring
up
a
brady
claim,
a
newly
discovered
evidence?
it
wouldn't
be
limited
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
question
of
pay.
i
think
justice
alito
was
asking,
counsel
says:
i've
got
a
duty
to
represent
my
client
zealously,
so
i
want
to
bring
up
not
only
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
these
other
matters.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
--
post-conviction
application
would
go
to
the
trial
judge;
right?
and
on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
both
in
the
trial
judge
with
this
anders
type
speech
that
doesn't
raise
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
it's
such
an
obvious
claim
to
make
that
when
the
--
when
the
judge
reviews
that
brief,
if
the
trial
judge
thought
that
this
defendant
was
abysmally
represented,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
court
say,
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
accept
this
anders
speech.
it
seems
to
me
you
--
there
was
enslavement
--
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
you
should
raise
that.
that's
a
viable
issue,
so
i'm
not
going
to
accept
your
briefs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
judge
reviews
the
anders
review
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
a
valid
one,
the
judge
would
have
spotted
these
issues,
and
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
have
been
argued
on
that
first--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
if
--
in
the
martinez
case,
there
was
an
anders
brief,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
the
trial
court,
i
mean
the
excuse
--
the
excuse
of
counsel
is
not
automatic,
the
trial
judge
has
to
look
at
it
and
say,
no,
there
is
--
there's
no
issue
for
you
to
pursue,
so
i'm
going
to
excuse
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
much
time
in
the
procedure
you
described,
when
appointed
counsel
does
inform
martinez:
i'm
not
bringing
up
any
claims
for
you,
so
if
you
want
to
pursue
relief
you
have
to
do
so
on
your
own.
how
much
time
does
the
defendant
have?
how
much
time
remains?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain
to
me
why
don't
we
consider
this
adverse
boost
to
your
proceeding,
because
this
post-conviction
proceeding,
it
began
--
it
began
the
same
time
as
the
direct
appeal,
but
it
ended
before
this
case
became
final.
so
it
was
a
first
--
it
was
a
first
tier,
because
it
was
decided
before
the
direct
appeal.
