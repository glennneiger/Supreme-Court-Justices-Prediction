justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
does
this
work
now,
counsel?
how
are
you
proposing
this
work?
right
now
in
the
federal
system
a
pro
se
litigant
comes
in
and
says:
i
have
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
most
district
courts
say,
ask
the
attorney
to
submit
an
affidavit,
and
then
decides
whether
on
the
face
of
the
claims
there
is
reason
to
appoint
counsel
and
hold
a
hearing.
under
your
theory,
every
state
would
be
obligated
to
appoint
counsel
ab
initio
to
check
out
whether
there
is
the
potential
for
an
<iac>
[=
iac]
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you
are
essentially
saying,
every
state
is
obligated
to
appoint
an
attorney
on
the
first
leg?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
a
huge
reliance
interest
that
has
developed
since
finley
and
its
progeny,
and
states
don't
routinely
appoint
post-conviction
counsel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
that
reliance
interest
and
the
burdens
on
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
know
--
i
know
for
a
fact
that
most
do
in
capital
cases.
but
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
same
figure
for
non-capital
cases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it's
only
a
cost
if
that
second
counsel,
however
its
secured,
can
actually
make
a
credible
or
sustainable
claim
that
appellate
counsel,
the
first
tier
counsel,
was
ineffective.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
federal
courts
handle
them
routinely.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
federal
courts
handle
them
routinely
on
papers,
and
most
of
them
are
denied.
is
the
state
system
different?
where
first
level
counsel,
appellate
counsel,
post-conviction
counsel
raises
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel.
how
many
of
those
cases
end
up
in
hearing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
very
few.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
go
back
to
just
clarify
the
record
for
a
second?
what
authorized
levitt
to
file
the
post-conviction
relief
motion?
wasn't
he
appointed
simply
to
prosecute
the
direct
appeal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
gave
him
the
authority
to
file
the
32
motion?
obviously,
he
didn't
seek
his
client's
approval
because
the
client
when
he
received
it
said:
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying;
i
only
speak
spanish.
so
what
gave
levitt
the
authority
to
do
what
she
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
an
attorney
appointed
just
on
the
direct
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
would
have
been
--
what
was
the
tactical
advantage
of
doing
what
she
did?
what
conceivable
reason
was
there
for
her
to
file
the
rule
32
motion
before
direct
review
finished?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
know
that
she
didn't.
so
answer
my
question.
what
reason
did
levitt
have,
strategic
or
otherwise,
to
file
the
rule
32
motion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
she
files
essentially
an
ander's
brief
that
says:
i
don't
see
anything.
what
was
the
strategic
reason
for
doing
that?
what
conceivable
strategic
reason?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
mean
--
that
makes
no
sense
to
me.
that
happens
quite
frequently
on
direct
appeal
where
a
variety
of
issues
are
raised
and
the
court
--
the
circuit
court
or
the
appellate
courts
send
it
back
to
trial
counsel
to
develop
the
record
further.
your
position
is
every
time
there
is
a
sending
back,
that
stops
the
need
for
effective
counsel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
47
states
and
the
federal
government
does?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
you
haven't
told
me
is
a
reason
why
he
shouldn't
have
had
effective
counsel
in
the
first
post-conviction
proceeding?
i
mean,
our
entire
line
of
cases
under
douglas
were
premised
on
the
fact
that
defendants
would
not
be
or
couldn't
be
charged
with
the
ability
to
prosecute
their
claims
through
direct
appeal.
discretionary
appeal,
we
said
the
likelihood
is
they
could
do
it
on
discretionary
appeal
because
they
would
have
a
record
from
below,
they
would
have
competent
counsel
below
who
would
make
the
best
arguments
possible,
they
could
then
pursue
their
discretionary
appeals
because
they
had
something
to
work
with.
but
if
your
first
chance
is
to
present
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
is
a
post-conviction
proceeding,
you
have
no
record
to
work
with.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
now
told
me
that
the
vast
majority
of
states,
47
i
think
is
the
number
you
gave
--
put
this
into
post
conviction,
give
counsel
at
post-conviction
review.
isn't
it
an
empty
promise
if
what
you
are
giving
is
incompetent
counsel?
i
mean,
strickland
is
a
very
high
standard.
