mr.
kent
e.
cattani
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
focus
on
three
points.
first,
petitioner
is
advocating
a
significant
change
to
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
does
implicate
the
state's
reliance
interest
on
finley
and
giarratano.
it's
not
a
minor
change--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
think
they
come
primarily
from
the
logical
extension
of
the
rule
that
would
require
a
second
post-conviction
proceeding
to
eliminate
the
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
post-conviction
counsel.
right
now,
those
claims
are
routinely
rejected
under
finley
and
giarratano
because
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
under
the
theory
and
--
i
don't
think
there's
really
been
advanced
a
principled
basis
for
limiting
the
rule
that's
been
advanced,
and
certainly--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--the
additional
costs
would
be
implicated
with
a
second
post-conviction
proceeding.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
think
it's
--
if
the
nature
of
ineffective
assistance
claims,
they
are
easy
to
raise
and
difficult
to
litigate.
it's
--
it's
not
difficult
to
raise
--
to
assert
ineffective
assistance.
it's
very
obvious
in
capital
cases
where
an
assertion
is
my
attorney
was
ineffective
at
sentencing
for
failing
to
raise--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--pardon
me?
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
the
statistics.
they
do
not
generally
result
in
--
in
evidentiary
hearings.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
in
noncapital
cases.
certainly
in
capital
cases,
i
think
the
majority
do.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
at
hearing,
levitt
was
appointed
to
prosecute
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
she
was
representing
emitz
and
martinez,
and
the
rules
allow
the
filings
of
both
convictions
petitions.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
that
would
prevent
her
from
representing
him
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
if
she
saw
something
that
she
thought
needed
to
be
raised
in
a
post--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
don't
know
that
there
was
necessarily
a
tactical
reason.
the
reason
would
be
in
some
cases
that
if
an
attorney
views
the
case
as
having
a
potentially
meritorious
issue
on
post
conviction,
you
get
relief
earlier.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
know
that
she
had
one.
but
there
was
some
indication
in
the
record
that
there
was
some
evidence
that
she
wanted
to
raise
an
issue
that
the
victim's
diary
would
have
contained
some
exculpatory
information,
and
that
would
have
been
something
that
would
have
had
to
have
been
developed
in
a
post-conviction
brief.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
if
she
thought
that
there
would
be
a
claim,
that
after
looking
at
it
further,
decided
that
the
claims
were
not
tolerable
is,
i
think,
what
happened
in
this
instance.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
it
is
what
happened
in
arizona.
frequently,
prior
to
the
spreitz
decision.
and
historically
counsel
was
allowed
--
counsel
were
allowed
to
raise
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
and
stay
the
appeal.
and
that
was
the
practice
previously.
so
it
is
not
necessarily
unusual
that
an
attorney
reviewing
the
record
might
decide
that
there
are
some
issues
that
could
be
raised
in
post
conviction.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
think
it's
better
viewed
through
the
lens
of
procedural
due
process.
we
are
looking
at
what
are
the
procedures
that
are
available
to
a
defendant
to
raise
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel.
one
of
the
ways
that
you
can
do
that,
that
certainly
goes
a
long
way
to
satisfying
procedural
due
process,
is
appoint
counsel.
it
could
be
accomplished
without
appointing
counsel,
certainly
having
somebody--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
think
you're
--
you're
not
right
from
the
standpoint
that
we
do
have
to
provide
procedural
due
process.
and
the
question
is
whether
that
was
enough.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
think
that
goes
well
beyond
this
court's
previous--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
think
it
is
blocked
by
precedent,
certainly
by
f
and
giarratano.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
the
problem
with
just
shifting
--
because
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
and
thus
no
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
think
it
does
create
an
infinite
continuum.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
but
the
other
problem
with
it
is--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--that's
correct,
but
if
you
don't,
then
the
problem
is
you
shift
over
to
federal
court,
and
on
federal
habeas
you
are
then
in
the
position
of
litigating
claims
that
are
untethered
to
any
state
court
decision.
and
when
we
talk
about
whether
it's
blocked
by
current
precedent,
certainly
under
edwards
v.
carpenter
to
allege
ineffective
assistance
as
cause
to
overcome
a
procedural
default,
there
is
a
requirement
that
you
litigate
that
claim
in
state
court.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
think
it
would,
but
it's
even
more
problematic
here
in
that
the
procedure
is
that
the
attorney
files
a
notice,
gives
a
notice
to
the
defendant
that
she's
been
unable
to
find
any
tolerable
claims
and
gives
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
file
his
own
pleading.
so
it's
somewhat
illogical
to
think
that
if
we
just
grant
a
second
post-conviction
proceeding
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
in
any
better
position
than
he's
in,
in
this
type
of
situation
where
he's
advised
that
the
attorney
says
that,
as
is
routinely
the
case,
i
am
unable
to
find
tolerable
claims,
and
then
the
defendant
is
given
an
opportunity
to
file
his
own
petition.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
recall
the
specific
time.
i
believe
it
is
in
the
brief.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
recall
the
number
of
days
that
were
remaining.
but
certainly
a
defendant
can
request
additional
time
if
the
period
of
time
is
very
short
at
that
point.
extensions
are
routinely
granted
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well
the
person
--
here
he
received
the
benefit
of
counsel
because
it's
appointed
in
arizona.
he
receives
the
benefit
of
counsel.
if
your
question
is:
would
he
be
entitled
to
the
effective
assistance
of
the
attorney
developing
that
record?
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
i
don't
think
so
necessarily.
i
think
that's
a
different.
i
think
of
the
attack
on
the
effectiveness
of
collateral
review
of
trial
counsel
is
itself
a
collateral
attack.
and
i
think
under
finley
and
giarratano,
and
i
think
the
distinction
this
court
has
drawn
between
direct
review
and
collateral
attack
is
one
that
should
be
maintained.
and
in
theory--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
ever--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following,
because
i
think
the
procedure
that
errs
on
the
following
is
--
is
something
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
of
finley
and
giarratano.
what
--
what
arizona
does
is
not
extraordinary;
it
really
follows
what
has
been
recommended
in
massaro,
that
--
that
claims
relating
to--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
think
in
--
in
massaro
this
court
noted
that
it
--
it
would
be
rare
for
any
--
for
any
--
for
a
defendant
to
be
entitled
to
relief
on
a
claim
that
could
be
raised
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
that's
--
it's
a
difficult
question.
i
--
i
don't
think
they
would,
because
i
think
it's
still
a
collateral
proceeding
to
address
the
--
the
effectiveness
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
think
more
important
than
the
--
than
the
label
that's
been
put
on
it
is
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
argument
that's
being
advanced,
and
it's
a
collateral
attack,
whether
it
--
whether
the
state
choose
to
call
it
as
part
of
the
appeal.
what
happened
in
arizona
previously
was
that
it
would
be--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
i
think
that's
the
--
the
logical
extension
of
what
this
court
announced
in
finley
versus
--
finley
and
giarratano,
that
we
--
we've
drawn
this
distinction
between--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--but
i
guess
i'm
not
certain
that
the
timing
would
--
would
make
a
difference
of
when
--
of
whether
you
had
a
direct
appeal
first
or
whether
the
collateral
proceeding
occurs
first.
in
either
case
the
collateral
proceeding
is
a
non-record-based
attack
on
the
conviction
as
opposed
to
the
direct
review
which
is
a
record-based
review
of
the
conviction.
so
that
the
timing
i
don't
think
is
as
important
as
the
nature
of
what's
happening;
it's
a
non-record
based
attack
on
the
conviction.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
i
don't
think
we
are
suggesting
that
would
be
the
desired
outcome.
and
--
it's
simply
that
drawing
the
distinction
between
collateral--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
guess
the
suggestion
is
that
it's
a
collateral,
that's
a
collateral
proceeding.
if
you
stay
the
proceeding
and
go
back
and
address
ineffective
assistance
that
that
would
essentially
be
a
collateral
proceeding.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
if
they've
sent
something
back
for
a
new
hearing,
i
think
that's
something
different.
i
think
you--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--i
don't
think
we
need
to.
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--well,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
more
important
to
--
to
assess
the
inquiry
that's
being
done,
whether
it's
a
collateral
inquiry
as
opposed
to
whether
we
are
labeling
it
part
of
the
--
the
direct
appeal
or
not.
and
if
it
is
a
collateral
inquiry,
then
it
makes
more
sense
i
think
to
--
to
couch
it
in
terms
of
this
is
a
collateral
review.
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
uh--
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
--yes,
i
agree.
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
kent
e.
cattani
well,
it
is
a
first-tier
collateral
attack.
i
would
agree
that
it's
the
first
tier.
that's
the
first
time
that
this
issue
is
raised
in
a
collateral
attack.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
determinative
of
the
issue
here.
this
court
has
never
--
has
never
said
that
every
claim
that
can
only
be
raised
for
the
first
time
entitles
someone
to
--
to
counsel.
and
that
exception,
that
would
--
that
would
swallow
the
rule.
in
arizona,
in
most
states
where
the
types
of
claims
that
can
be
raised
in
post-conviction
proceedings
are
generally
limited
to
claims
that
could
not
have
been
raised
earlier.
so
the
rule
that
petitioner
is
seeking
really
would
swallow
--
the
exception
would
swallow
the
rule
that
was
announced
in
--
in
finley
--
and
giarratano.
