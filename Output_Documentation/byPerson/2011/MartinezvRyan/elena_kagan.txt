justice
elena
kagan
so
mr.
bartels,
before
you
do
that,
i
mean,
i
understood
you
to
be
saying
that
you
would
draw
a
line
after
the
first
post-conviction
proceeding;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
briefs
go
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
that
line
--
you
know,
what
lies
behind
that
line.
but
you
would
draw
the
line
there?
justice
elena
kagan
i
was
wondering
what
you
would
say
--
some
of
these
statistics
is
just
that
these
claims
succeed
very,
very
rarely.
so
by
the
analysis
that
you
just
used,
this
kind
of
balancing
analysis,
why
we
should
even
go
so
far
as
you
would
have
us
go?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
cattani,
can
i
ask
about
your
interests
here,
because
your
state
is
one
that
does
appoint
counsel.
so
you
already
have
the
costs
there.
i'm
just
wondering,
in
your
brief,
you
talk
a
lot
about
the
excessive
costs
that
this
would
impose
on
you.
and
i'm
just
wondering
where
those
costs
come
from
if
you
appoint
counsel
already.
and
i
know
some
other
states
are
in
a
different
situation,
but
as
to
you,
where
do
the
costs
come
from?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
we
just
said
there
is,
you
know,
we
can
only
draw
a
line
in
this
context
and
we're
going
to
draw
the
line
here,
and
this
is
where
it
sticks.
what
are
the
additional
costs
to
you?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
cattani,
if
you
handled
this
through
the
regular
appeals
process,
the
person
would
receive
the
benefit
of
counsel.
is
that
correct?
rather
than
shuttle
this
over
to
the
post-conviction
review
process?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
exactly
right.
justice
elena
kagan
try--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
massaro
indeed
said
there
are
good
reasons
for
withdrawing
this
issue
and
putting
it
in
a
different
kind
of
process.
so
suppose
the
state
does
this,
and
some
states
do
it:
they
say
on
--
in
the
direct
appeal
process,
we
are
going
to
remand
this
issue
back
to
the
trial
court
because
the
trial
court
is
going
to
be
fast
and
can
make
an
evaluation.
that's
part
of
the
direct
appeal
process,
this
--
this
remand.
would
the
person
then
be
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
elena
kagan
even
though
now
it's
part
of
the
regular
appeals
process.
it's
just
the
way
--
because
of
the
issues
that
we
recognized
in
massaro,
the
state
has
decided
to
structure
things
in
this
way?
justice
elena
kagan
so
now
you
are
creating
a
different
rule.
you
are
saying
anything
which
somebody
determines
is
appropriately
raised
as
a
collateral
attack,
even
if
there's
been
no
first
review
of
that
question,
there
is
no
entitlement
to
counsel?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
think
as
justice
kennedy
says
that
we
ever
really
considered
that
question
in
finley
and
giarratano,
because
we
were
assuming
there
that
all
the
things
had
been
through
the
appeals
process.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
reason
i
think
it's
relevant
is
that
if
you
were
to
say
that
there
needed
to
be
effective
assistance
of
counsel
there,
then
i
would
have
asked
you,
what
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
that
case?
so
that's
the
reason
it
is
relevant
to
this
case,
because
the
difference
is
really
just
one
of
just
labels.
justice
elena
kagan
but
they
didn't
--
only
the
first--
justice
elena
kagan
--look
at
the
effective
assistance
claims.
so
what
you
say,
mr.
wall,
if
the
stated
did
the
following
--
if
it
said
we
are
going
to
take
out
all
fourth
amendment
exclusion
claims
and
we
are
going
to
put
that
in
the
post-conviction
review
system,
and
you
know
what,
there,
you
are
not
entitled
to
an
effective
lawyer.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sure
the
state
would
not
say
it
was
acting
arbitrarily
in
my
example.
the
state
would
say
there
is
a
good
reason
for
it,
the
fourth
amendment
exclusion
claims
are
disfavored,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
innocence;
they
involve
a
kind
of
fact-intensive
inquiry
that
is
better
done
in
a
different
proceeding.
so
i
think
that
the
state
would
have
many
good
reasons,
but,
you
know,
it's
also
true
that
there,
you
don't
get
a
lawyer.
