justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
could
you
answer
the
original
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked?
she
said:
what
happens
in
arizona?
you
said
a
prisoner,
or
defendant,
he
has
been
convicted,
gone
through
his
first
round
of
appeal.
he
is
given
a
form,
which
you
said
was
a
simple
form,
do
you
want
to
proceed
in
collateral
review?
and
he
answers
yes.
then
does
arizona
appoint
a
lawyer
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
what
are
we
arguing
about?
he
had
his
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
so
now
you
are
talking
about
the
second
round.
you
are
talking
about
does
he
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
when
he
wants
to
claim
that
the
first
lawyer
that
they
gave
him
on
collateral
review
was
ineffective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
why
--
that's
what
i
thought,
actually;
and
i
don't
understand
what
all
the
briefs
are
about,
and
i
must
be
missing
something,
about
whether
they
are
all
going
to
have
to
appoint
lawyers
or
not
in
these
different
states.
it
seems
to
me
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
case
comes
out
of
a
state
that
does
appoint
lawyers
and
the
question
is
whether
you,
your
client,
should
have
from
your
point
of
view
at
least
one
full,
effective
chance
to
say,
every
lawyer
i
have
been
appointed,
i've
gotten
100
and
they
are
all
terrible,
and
--
or
whether
the
state
can
block
that
from
being
heard
in
habeas,
by
saying,
oh,
no,
we
gave
him
19
and
the
claim
that
all
19
were
ineffective,
he
can't
even
raise.
that's
the
issue,
is
that
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no
--
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
ridiculing
as
it
sounded
your
claim.
i'm
saying
maybe
that's
right.
maybe
he's
not
going
to
win
the
claim,
probably;
but
the
question
is,
if
his
claim
is
in
federal
habeas,
i
have
gotten
102
lawyers
in
102
proceedings
and
every
one
of
them
was
absolutely
ineffective,
perhaps
that
habeas
judge
has
to
look
at
it
and
say
oh,
i
see,
he's
claiming
he
never
had
one
full
effective
chance
to
claim
that
his
trial
lawyer
was
ineffective
because
the
other
19
was
just
as
bad
--
i
have
to
look
at
it
if
i'm
a
trial
judge.
now,
that
is
not
a
silly
argument
in
my
opinion;
that
could
be
a
winning
argument.
i
just
want
to
know
is
that
basically
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
let's
start
at
ground
zero,
sorry.
everyone
else--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can
--
you
can
have
a
--
you
don't
have
to
give
him
a
counsel.
look,
the
state
did
give
him
a
counsel
on
first
collateral
review;
that
counsel
was
supposed
to,
according
to
him,
raise
the
claim,
my
trial
counsel
was
no
good.
now
we
go
to
the
next
round.
the
state
says:
i'm
sorry,
you
are
on
your
own
here;
we
are
not
giving
you
a
lawyer
anymore.
okay.
that
may
count.
he
now
has
to
know
he
has
to
make
the
argument
himself.
and
therefore
he
goes
and
makes
the
argument
himself,
and
now
he's
in
habeas
and
he
can
argue
they
got
it
all
wrong.
he's
not
blocked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
--
there
isn't
an
issue
in
this
case
about
giving
people
counsel,
on
that
view.
there
is
an
issue
about
if
you
do
give
them
counsel,
then
they
have
to
be
able
to
have
an
argument
later
that
you
did
it
ineffectively.
that's
a
different
matter;
that's
a
question
of
whether
you
are
blocked
in
habeas
and
can't
even
make
the
claim.
all
right,
forget
it.
i
will
ask
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
this
is
not
--
we
will
say
this
is
my
argument.
i
don't
want
to
make
this
your
friend's
argument.
in
arizona
there
was
a
trial,
and
the
defendant
thinks
trial
counsel
was
inadequate.
then
there
was
a
collateral
review,
and
arizona
appoints
a
lawyer
for
that.
and
after
that,
the
arizona
courts
thought,
no,
he
was
adequate
at
trial.
this
particular
defendant
wants
to
say
that
that
lawyer
was
inadequate,
too.
in
fact,
it
was
the
same
one.
hardly
surprising.
that's
his
view.
now
when
he
makes
that
argument
in
federal
court,
i
guess
he's
going
to
be
met
with
the
claim,
since
arizona
didn't
have
to
appoint
the
lawyer
for
collateral
review,
it
doesn't
matter
what
that
lawyer
does.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
guess
where
i'm
going
here.
maybe
nobody
wants
to
go
there.
just
follow
the
questions.
the
question
is,
if
he
tries
to
make
the
claim
he
does,
want
to
say
that
my
first
lawyer
was
no
good
at
trial,
and
my
second
lawyer,
who
by
coincidence
was
the
same
in
the
collateral
proceeding,
was
no
good
either,
then
the
state
comes
in
and
says:
you
can't
make
that
argument
now
because
we
had
a
proceeding
called
the
collateral
review
proceeding;
we
didn't
have
to
give
you
a
lawyer
there.
but
even
if
that
lawyer
was
inadequate,
you
lose
because
we
didn't
have
to
give
you
one.
am
i
right
about
that?
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
you
know.
i'll
answer
it.
you
say
that
is
enough
to
give
him
a
lawyer.
okay?
it
is
enough.
but
you
have
to
give
him
an
adequate
lawyer
if
you
give
him
one.
if
you
give
him
one.
you
don't
have
to
give
him
one.
but
if
you
give
him
one,
it
has
to
be
adequate.
now
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
would
that
is
done.
but
that's
where
i
think
we
are
at.
now
why
not
say
this,
that
every
defendant
has
to
have
one
fair
shot
at
claiming,
they
can
make
the
claim
that
his
trial
lawyer
was
inadequate.
and
the
state
doesn't
have
to
give
him
the
lawyer
at
collateral
review;
but
if
it
does,
then
that
lawyer,
he
can
say,
couldn't
make
that
claim
because
he
was
inadequate.
so
you
say,
fine,
they
can
make
that
argument
in
habeas.
i
bet
they
never
win.
but
somebody
might.
he
can
make
it.
so
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
habeas
judge
in
federal
habeas
would
read
the
piece
of
paper.
he'd
say:
what's
the
ground
for
thinking
this,
and
then
he
would
make
his
normal
kinds
of
judgments.
now
what
is
--
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
view?
is
it
absolutely
blocked
by
precedent?
it
seems
to
me
it
would
relieve
the
concerns
of
the
states
about
worrying
about
having
to
appoint
a
lot
of
lawyers,
and
it
gives
him
a
fair
shot
to
make
his
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
where
you
would
have
to
make
the
exception.
you'd
say:
if
you
give
him
a
counsel,
he
does
have
the
right
to
an
effective
assistance
of
counsel
insofar
as
the
ineffectiveness
would
prevent
him
from
raising
a
claim
that
to
be
fair
the
trial
itself
has
to
be
--
he
has
to
have
that
about
the
trial
itself.
without
exception,
it
would
be
that
exception.
now
is
there
something
in
those
cases
that
blocks
that
exception?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
a
sense
it
does,
but
he's
never
going
to
win
the
infinite
continuum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
never
have
to
give
him
a
lawyer
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
not
going
that
far?
what
about
saying
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
arizona
did
give
him
a
lawyer.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
same
lawyer.
in
this
case,
the
proceeding
was
filed
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
appeal
and
ended
before
the
completion
of
the
appeal.
so
for
this
case,
this
counts
as
the
one
round
of
proceedings,
and
therefore,
his
client
can
in
fact
assert
that
that
single
individual
who
was
his
lawyer
was
incompetent
in
those
proceedings
that
ended
--
didn't
end
prior
to
the
termination
of
the
appeal,
ended
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it
didn't
face
the
issue
of
what
about
a
claim
that
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
bring
up
at
least
once?
and
this
is
the
first
time
he
was
able
to
bring
it
up.
so
in
other
words,
coleman
didn't
face
this
problem.
it's
as
if
you
couldn't
bring
up
the
claim
that
the
judge
was
sleeping
until
he
got
the
collateral
proceedings.
a
state
could
have
such
a
rule
--
i
don't
know
why
they
would,
but
they
could.
but
if
they
did,
it
would
be
your
first
chance
ever
to
attack
that
file
process,
and
so
isn't
coleman,
in
its
effort
to
bar
relitigation,
actually
rather
beside
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
we
are
saying
it
the
same
way,
just
as
if
his
lawyer,
when
he
could
raise
the
fact
that
the
judge
was
sleeping,
didn't
raise
it
because
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
had
been
drinking
too
much.
just
as
he
could
raise
that
point
in
habeas,
because
it's
his
first
chance
to
do
it,
so
he
could
raise
the
point
that
the
lawyer,
the
first
time
that
he
had
the
chance
to
raise
the
ineffectiveness
of
trial
counsel,
was
incompetent,
et
cetera.
