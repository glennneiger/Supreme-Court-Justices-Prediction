what
if
the
state
doesn't
but
the
federal
government
does?
i
mean,
what
if
you
say,
there
is
no
state
habeas
available;
you
go
straight
to
federal
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
haven't
really
given
us
a
solution
for
the
states.
they
can't
--
they
can't
stop
this
thing.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
other
claims
that
don't
follow
on?
i
mean,
other
claimed
errors
in
the
trial?
you
say
the
state
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
that
representation.
does
counsel
keep
time
sheets
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
the
various
issues,
12-minute
intervals?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
state
pays
for
some
issues
and
not
for
other
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
certainly
can't
be
dealt
with
on
direct
appeal;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
you
get
a
different
counsel
to
--
to
take
the
appeal,
you
could
always
claim
that
that
counsel
was
ineffective
in
habeas,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
involved
in
this
case?
do
we
have
to
decide
this
for
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
another
case.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
seems
to
me
a
rational
line
between
collateral
attack
and
attack
in
the
same
proceeding.
i
don't
see
anything
irrational
about
that.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
!
