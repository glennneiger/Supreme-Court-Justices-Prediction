mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justices
sotomayor
and
kagan,
i
want
to
go
to
your
questions
about
the
costs,
because
there
are
some
very
real
costs
here.
we
live
in
a
world
that
is
settled
and
working.
although
this
court
has
drawn
the
line
at
the
first
direct
appeal,
47
states,
d.c.
and
the
federal
government
provide
counsel
in
a
first
post-conviction
proceeding,
either
as
a
right
or
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
as
public
defender.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
so
there
are
18
states
that
provide
it
as
a
right,
29
states
and
d.c.
provide
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
and
the
public
defender,
and
the
federal
government
obviously
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
courts.
and
so
what
petitioner
is
doing,
by
its
constitutionalizing
that
area,
is
shifting
resources
to
a
subset
of
ineffectiveness
claims.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand,
but
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
states
are
permitted
to
draw
different
lines,
and
what
petitioner
is
saying
--
take
the
federal
system,
for
example.
petitioner's
rule
would
say
a
federal
prisoner
can
walk
in
under
2255
and
by
making
an
allegation
of
ineffectiveness,
of
either
trial
or
appellate
counsel,
he
is
entitled
to
appointed
counsel,
without
even
i
take
it
a
showing
of
colorableness.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
that
is
exactly
where
he
would
stop.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
explain
why
his
rule
doesn't
require
him
to
go
further,
because
by
saying
the
first
tier
is
not
a
stage
of
a
case,
as
this
court
has
always
meant
it,
but
it
applies
claim
by
claim,
and
lawyers
are
going
to
represent
you
only
on
some
claims,
and
you're
--
pro
se
you
will
file
others
--
he
ends
up
with
two
problems.
one,
he
has
to
concede
as
he
does
in
his
reply
brief
and
as
he
did
in
response
to
justice
alito,
that
he
is
going
to
say
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
a
lot
of
other
claims
that
are
typically
raised
in
habeas;
and
second,
he
can't
find
a
limiting
principle.
because
when
you
come
in
your
second
or
your
third
or
your
post-fourth
conviction
proceeding,
and
you
say
all
my
previous
counsel
has
been
ineffective,
that
is
also
the
first
time
that
you
have
been
able
to
say
it;
and
you
will
be
making
the
same
claim:
i
am
entitled
to
have
one
constitutionally
competent
lawyer
argue
that
my
trial
counsel
is
ineffective.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
here's
the
primary
problem
with
that,
justice
breyer.
this
court
said
in
coleman,
and
before
that
in
murray
v.
carrier
and
in
wainwright
v.
torna,
that
if
you
don't
have
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
counsel
and
the
states
or
congress
go
beyond
what
they
are
constitutionally
required
to
do
when
they
give
you
a
lawyer,
that
performance
does
not
thereby
give
rise
to
a
due
process
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer,
i
think
we
just
see
the
case
in
fundamentally
different
ways.
his
first
opportunity
to
raise
his
trial's
ineffectiveness
claim
was
in
his
first
post-conviction
proceeding,
and
he
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
and
his
lawyer
didn't.
and
what
he's
coming
in
and
saying
now
is
not
i
was
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
raise
it,
as
in
europe,
but
i
had
the
opportunity
and
i
didn't--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i
think
this
case
presents
a
much
narrower
question,
which
is,
when
he
comes
in,
in
his
second
post-conviction
proceeding
and
says
although
i
didn't
raise
it
last
time
around,
i
have
cause
to
excuse
that
default
because
my
lawyer
was
ineffective.
this
court's
been
clear
in
three
different
cases
--
that
is
only
cause
if
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
a
proceeding
that
he's
pointed
to
and
that
he
complains
about.
so
the
question--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right.
just
so
--
i
think
this
is
a
very
different
case
from
douglas
and
halbert,
which
were
grounded
in
a
fairly
fundamental
equal
protection
concern,
that
indigent
defendants
would
be
denied
a
first
look
--
maybe
an
only
look
--
at
their
convictions
and
sentences.
here,
we're
facing
something
very
different.
states
like
arizona
are
giving
direct
appeals;
defendants
are
getting
looks
at
their
convictions
and
sentences,
as
petitioner
did,
they're
providing
post-conviction
review.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
they
are
even
providing
lawyers
in
post-conviction
review--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
kagan,
i
think
there
are
any
number
of
claims,
that
if
a
state
tried
to
pull
them
out
of
direct
appeal
and
locate
them
in
collateral
review,
we
might
be
able
to
say
it's
then
running
its
obligation
under
douglas
because
those
are
the
types
of
claims
based
on
a
trial
record
that
ought
to
be
--
and
always
have
belonged
to
direct
appeal.
the
question
is
did
the
state
act
arbitrarily
when
it
takes
an
ineffectiveness
claim.
so
the
only
type
of
claim
that
the
state
is
trying
to
relocate
into
collateral
review
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
kagan,
i
just
--
i
think
the
court's
case
law
would
--
i
mean,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
question;
the
court
having
said
that
under
stone,
at
least
in
the
federal
system,
the
fourth
amendment
claims
can't
be
raised
on
habeas
because
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
state
to
come
in
and
say
they
have
to
be
raised
in
habeas.
here,
the
court
said
in
massaro
these
claims
are
best
suited
to
resolution
in
habeas,
and
they
are
claims
that
are
traditionally
brought
in
habeas.
and
at
least
for
that
type
of
claim,
which
is
the
--
i
mean,
the
state's
not
trying
to
hide
the
ball
here.
all
the
state
has
done
was
take
a
claim
that
this
court
has
said
belongs
in
habeas
and
say
we
are
putting
it
in
habeas,
not
in
a
federal
system
where
although
people
can
raise
it
as
a
practical
matter,
they're
all
decided
on
collateral
review
--
virtually
all
of
them.
it
says,
we
are
just
going
to
say
people
have
trouble
briefing
and
raising
it
and
we
will
relocate
it
to
collateral
review,
not
for
ambiguous
or
arbitrary
reasons
but
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
this
court
gave
in
massaro.
so
at
least
for
that
type
of
claim,
i
think
it's
permissible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
leaving
for
another
day
whether
they
could
do
it
with
other
types
of
claims
--
that
i
do
think
probably
belong
to
a
direct
appeal.
and
that
would
present
very
different
constitutional
problems
if
a
state
started
trying
to
channel
them
to
collateral
review,
but
--
all
arizona
has
done
is
pick
up
on
massaro
and
say
absolutely
right,
these
claims
belong
in
habeas,
and
that's
where
we
are
going
to
put
them.
and
collateral
review--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
sotomayor,
a
number
of
states
have
found
under
their
own
constitution
or
statutes
a
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
it's
a
very
different
matter
to
say
that
when
states
go
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires
in
providing
counsel,
that
counsel's
performance
thereby
gives
rise
to
a
due
process
claim.
and
again,
the
courts
rejected
that
in
at
least
three
cases,
and
i
think
saying
that
it's
cause
to
excuse
a
procedural
default
here
without
saying
that
there
is
some
underlying
right
to
counsel
would
require
a
ruling
in
those
other
cases.
