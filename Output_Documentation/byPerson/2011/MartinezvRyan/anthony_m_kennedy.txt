justice
anthony

but
we
want
to
know
what
rule
you
are
advocating
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
want
to
know
why
you
are
not
advocating
for
what
justice
breyer
and
justice
alito
indicate
is
an
endless
right
to
claim
that
all
previous
counsel
were
ineffective.
you
say
oh,
no,
you
are
not
arguing
that.
what
is
the
rule
that
you
are
arguing
for?
what
limiting
principle
do
you
have
so
that
we
do
not
have
an
endless
right
of
counsel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
i
understand
that.
but
what
is
it
that
prevents
the
petitioner
from
saying
that
the
first
counsel
in
the
collateral
proceeding
was
ineffective
and
that
so
was
the
second?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
i
leave
this
argument
with
the
judgment
that
you
have
offered
me
no
limiting
principle
on
how
many
proceedings
there
must
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
there's
an
end
to
the
argument
that
previous
counsel
were
inadequate?
i
understand,
this
is
the
--
in
this
case
it
was
the
first
counsel
in
--
in
the
first
collateral
proceeding
that
we
are
talking
about.
but
why
couldn't
it
be
the
second?
you
don't
give
us
a
limiting
principle.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you
want
to
say
there
shouldn't
be,
then
that's
fine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
--
those
were--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--cases
in
which
you
could
not
raise
--
pardon
me,
in
which
you
could
raise
the
particular
issue
at
hand.
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
rationale
of
those
cases,
which
you
state
correctly,
is
applicable
to
a
different
set
of
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
those
were,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
cases
--
those
were
not
cases
in
which
the
issue
could
only
be
raised
on
collateral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
justice
kagan's
question
indicates
that
there
are
states,
as
you
know,
where
on
direct
appeal
they
can
allow
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
iac.
and
as
i
understand
your
answer,
is
if
that
happens
the
proceedings
that
precede
the
resolution
of
the
issue
on
direct
appeal,
being
probably
conducted
by
the
same
counsel
who
is
taking
the
direct
appeal,
can
be
conducted
and
he
can
be
--
and
the
counsel,
he
or
she
can
be
inadequate
in
the
conduct
of
those
further
inquiries.
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
direct,
when
he
conducts
some
supplementary
proceedings.
that's
very
strange.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
not
if
you
adopt
the
--
the
one
proceeding
rule
that
i
think
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
suggesting.
he
suggested
arizona
is
one
of
those
few
states
where
you
could
only
raise
this
issue
on
collateral,
and
therefore
you
are
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
that
trial.
and
he
would
stop
there,
for
statistical
and
for
--
reasons,
for
probability
reasons,
rather.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
is
martinez
versus
ryan,
number
10-1001.
after
a
criminal
conviction
in
a
state
court,
a
prisoner
may
want
to
raise
constitutional
claims
in
a
federal
court.
this
happens
with
some
frequency,
and
that
occurred
here.
petitioner,
luis
martinez,
sought
to
raise,
in
a
habeas
proceeding
in
federal
court,
the
claim
that
his
counsel
was,
in
effective
at
the
state
trial,
but
federal
claims,
as
a
general
rule,
cannot
be
raised
in
a
federal
habeas
court
proceeding
unless
the
prisoner
has
first
raised
them
in
state
courts.
and
if
the
prisoner
has
not
done
so
and
has
not
followed
settled
--
settled
state
procedural
rules,
then,
and
this
again
is
a
general
principle,
he
is
barred
from
raising
them
in
the
federal
proceeding
and
when
--
and
when
this
happens,
the
law
says
that
he
has
procedurally
defaulted
his
claim.
in
some
circumstances,
a
default
can
be
excused.
one
instance
of
an
excuse
is
when
the
prisoner's
counsel
was
ineffective
on
direct
appeal
where
the
federal
claim
first
should
have
been
raised.
now,
here,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
arizona
state
courts.
after
that
conviction,
he
did
not
raise
his
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
at
the
trial
at
the
first
opportunity
to
do
so
because
he
says
his
first
counsel
in
the
state
proceedings
after
trial
was
also
ineffective.
ordinarily,
that
would
be
an
excuse
for
procedural
default,
but
here
that
procedural
default
occurred
in
a
state
collateral
proceeding,
not
on
state
direct
review.
and
since
there
is,
in
general,
no
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
collateral
proceedings,
arizona
now
says
that
there
was
a
procedural
default
which
cannot
be
excused.
in
the
federal
habeas
proceedings,
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
arizona.
the
federal
courts
did
not
hear
the
petitioner's
claim
on
the
merits
and
the
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
on
--
on
certiorari
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
case
now
before
the
court,
the
petitioner
says
that
well,
this
might
have
been
a
correct
ruling
under
other
states'
systems,
here,
the
arizona
rules
did
not
allow
him
to
raise
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
at
trial
until
the
state
collateral
proceedings.
that
was
the
first
time
he
could
make
the
claim
whereas
here,
the
collateral
proceeding
is
the
first
designated
proceeding
for
a
prisoner
to
raise
a
claim
of
--
of
ineffective
assistance
at
trial.
the
collateral
proceeding
is
in
many
ways,
the
equivalent
of
a
prisoner's
direct
appeal
on
the
effective
assistance
issue.
and
so,
petitioner
says,
"if
his
counsel
was
ineffective
during
the
first
state
proceeding
when
the
federal
claim
could
have
been
raised,
the
procedural
default
is
excused."
for
the
reasons
set
forth
at
some
length
in
today's
opinion,
the
court
agrees
with
the
petitioner.
the
court
finds
that
the
procedural
default
is
excused
under
equitable
principles
that
inform
the
procedural
default
rule.
the
court's
holding
need
not
and
does
not
rest
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
