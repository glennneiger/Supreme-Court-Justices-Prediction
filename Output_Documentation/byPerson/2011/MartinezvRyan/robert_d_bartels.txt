mr.
robert
d.
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
arizona
almost
all
state
and
federal
claims
for
relief
from
a
criminal
conviction
are
raisable
in
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal.
however,
a
claim
that
trial
counsel
was
ineffective
must
be
presented
first
to
a
trial
court
in
what
arizona
labels
a
post-conviction
relief
proceeding.
petitioner
agrees
entirely
with
arizona's
requirement
that
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
claims
go
initially
to
a
trial
court,
and
he
does
not
object
to
the
label
"post-conviction
relief"
as
such.
the
issue
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
arizona's
insistence
that
petitioner
had
no
right
to
counsel
with
respect
to
the
post-conviction
first-tier
review,
portion
of
first-tier
review,
even
though
he
did
have
a
right
to
counsel
in
the
appeal
portion
of
direct
review.
and
our
position
is
that
that
distinction
between
what
are
two
portions
of
the
first
opportunity
for
review
of
a
conviction,
broken
up
sensibly
but
by
dictate
of
the
state
into
two
parts,
that
that
distinction
cannot
stand,
especially
in
a
case
in
which
the
first
post-conviction
proceeding
started
and
ended
before
anything
of
substance
happened
in
this--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
in
a
situation
--
the
federal
system
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
arizona,
but
not
much,
because
of
massaro.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
our
position
would
be
in
the
federal
system,
if
a
federal
defendant
wished
to
file
a
2255,
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
appointed
counsel,
but
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
only
with
respect
to
any
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
at
trial.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
with
the
caveat,
if
the
state
allows
that
kind
of
proceeding.
one
of
the
things
i
have
a
hard
time
keeping
track
of
in
this
context
is,
unlike
the
right
to
counsel
at
trial,
the
sixth
amendment
right,
where
i
think
they
have
to
give
him
a
trial,
we
are
dealing
in
a
context
where
this
court
made
clear
well
over
100
years
ago
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
review
at
all.
the
state--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--yes.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
if
the
state
--
if
the
state
provided
that
proceeding,
that
--
then
the
state
would
not
have
to.
the
state
could
have
statutes
of
limitation
or
rules
against
excessive
petitions
that
could
be
extremely
strict
if
they
are
concerned
about
that.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
situation,
we've
got
newly
discovered
evidence
of
perhaps
a
brady
violation.
in
that
situation,
if
the
state
provides
a
proceeding
for
review
of
that,
and
it
is
the
first
opportunity
for
review,
i
think
the
implication
of
douglas
and
halbert
is
--
there
would
be
a
right
to--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
federal
system--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
but
the
federal
system
itself
has
a
statute
of
limitation,
though
i
believe
that
the
statute
would
probably
begin
to
run,
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
with
the
discovery
of
a
brady
violation.
so
the
federal
courts
have
set
up
the
statute
of
limitations
to
accommodate
that
point.
and
the
states
would
be
free
to
do
that,
too,
if
they
wish.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
no,
your
honor.
the
right
to
counsel
would
apply
only
to
the
first-tier
review
issue.
and
so,
for
example,
if
counsel
finds
other
issues
and
wants
to
pursue
them,
the
state
could
say:
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
for
those.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
the
holding
in
this
case
won't
be
so
limited,
but
i
would
agree
that
douglas
and
halbert
would
imply
that
brady,
at
least
many
brady
claims,
would
be
such
that
the
2255
or
the
state
post-conviction
would
be
the
first
opportunity
to
present.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
state
does
not
have
any
duty
to
pay
the
lawyer
in
those
circumstances.
now,
the
kind
of
situation
you
are
talking
about
i
think
is
most
likely
to
come
up
where--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--your
honor,
i
think
the
appointment
could
be
limited
to
the
first-tier
review.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
in
that
example
pursuing
the
ineffective
assistance
claim
requires
pursuing
the
batson
claim.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
your
honor,
in
the
situation
in
which
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
is
based
on
the
failure
to
make
a
batson
claim,
the
failure
to
make
an
objection
at
trial,
i
would
agree
with
you,
absolutely.
in
my
experience--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
happens
routinely
in
the
state
system.
the
appointed
counsel
have
to
submit
detailed
billing
statements.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
i
think
the
states
could
run
this
in
different
ways.
the
way
in
which
arizona
does
it
makes
sense
to
me,
which
is
that
the
--
there
is
a
form,
form
24-b.
it's
a
very
simple
form.
it
doesn't
require
stating
any
substantive
grounds.
it
really
just
says:
i
would
like
to
challenge
my
conviction
through
post-conviction
relief,
in
the
very
same
way
that
notices
of
appeal--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--every
state
is
obligated
to
treat
these,
what
are
really
parts
of
the
appeal,
the
initial
appeal,
the
same
way
they
do
the
rest
of
the--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--i--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
guess
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
one,
there
are
a
fair
number
of
states
that
do
appoint
counsel
routinely
on
request.
arizona
is
one.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
i
don't
know
the
percentage,
your
honor,
but
i
know
there
are
several
states.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
he
didn't
have
an
effective
lawyer.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
first
post-conviction
counsel
constitutes
cause
to
excuse
the--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
actually,
once
we
take
it
past
two,
i
--
i'm
not
on
board
with
the
hypothetical.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
that
is
not
my
argument.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
your
honor,
on
a
theoretical
level,
i
don't
think
this
court's
decisions
in
douglas
and
ross
and
halbert
give
us
a
clear
answer
about
whether
there's
a
right
to
effective
assistance
of
second
post-conviction
counsel--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--i--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
theory
that
you
get
counsel
for
first-tier
review
limits
it
to
that
first
tier,
because
when
you
go
after
the
effectiveness
of
the
--
of
the
first
post-conviction
counsel,
that
is
necessarily
going
to
involve
review
of
the
effectiveness
of
trial
counsel.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
right
to
a
counsel
and
therefore
not
a
right
to
effective
counsel
in
the
second--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
on
the
same
page
with
that
example.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--no,
your
honor,
there
shouldn't.
and
the
merits
--
the
petitioner's
merits
brief
devoted
quite
a
few
pages
to
both
the
theoretical
problems
with
the
infinite
continuing
of
litigation
and
the
practical
limitations.
and
let
me
--
let
me
turn
to
the
practical
ones.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
theoretically.
and
the
state
has
the
wherewithal,
given
mckane,
to
draw
the
line
anywhere
it
pleases.
it
could
just
say
you
get
one
post-conviction.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
because
i--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
that
principle
doesn't
work
very
well
in
a
system
like
arizona's
where
you
can't
bring
this
one
claim
on
the
direct
appeal,
and
you
can
--
and
mr.
martinez,
well,
couldn't
--
you
can
file
your
first
post-conviction
and
litigate
it
while
the
appeal
is
pending
before
it's
final.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--no,
your
honor.
the
--
if
direct
appeal
is
now
going
to
encompass
possible
claims
of
ineffective
assistance,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
have
the
same
counsel
on
appeal.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
true
in
arizona.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
it
may
be
from
the
same
office.
but
i
agree
that
that
would
have
to
change
if
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
were
part
of
the
direct
appeal.
and
the
other
thing
that
would
have
to
be
done
--
and
this
is
done
in
some
states
--
is
that
you
have
to
raise
it
in
direct
appeal,
but
most
--
as
this
court
recognized
in
massaro
--
most
ineffective
assistance
claims
cannot
be
dealt
with
on
direct
appeal
because
of
a
lack
of
evidence.
they
need
more
evidence.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
your
honor,
i
--
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
state
does
not
have
to
provide
the
review
of
the
effectiveness
of
appellate
counsel.
if
it
does
so,
i
would
still
say
that
that's
going
to
end
up
having
to
be
second
opportunity
review
of
the
claims
that
appellate
counsel
failed
to
raise.
that's
got
to
be
the
basis
for--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
reason
is
that
--
in
terms
of
this
first
tier,
second
tier
analysis
from
douglas
and
halbert,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
effectiveness
of
appellate
counsel
without
looking
at
the
issue
of
prejudice.
and
that's
going
to
require
what
is
second
opportunity
review
of
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
the
appellate
lawyer
didn't
raise.
but
that's
the
second
opportunity
for
that
review,
because
the
direct
appeal
was
the
first
opportunity.
i
think
in
the
end,
though,
just
a
mathews
v.
eldridge
procedural
due
process
analysis
works
better.
and
the
critical
factor
is
what's
the
risk
of
an
error
in
the
absence
of
counsel?
well,
the
first
time
around,
the
risk
of
your
--
involves
the
probability
that
the
trial
judge
made
a
mistake
that's
prejudicial.
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
post-conviction
challenging
appellate
counsel's
effectiveness,
now
it's
the
probability
that
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
and
that
the
appellate
lawyer
was
wrong.
and
so
it's
exponentially
lower
--
that
at
least
provides
a
basis
for--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--no.
no.
i'm
sticking
with
the
example
of
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel.
trial
counsel
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
because
douglas
and
halbert
have
done
that
balancing
in
saying
that
in
this
situation,
the
first
tier
review,
the
probability
of
an
incorrect
result
without
counsel
is
sufficiently
high
that
there
should
be
counsel.
and
that's
really
the
disagreement
between
justice
douglas
and
justice
harlan
in
douglas.
justice
harlan
didn't
think
the
lawyers
mattered--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
i
think
there
would
be
something
like
that
with
the
right
to
counsel
for
these
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
claims.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
are
we
talking
about
the
martinez
case
itself?
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
there
was,
your
honor,
but
it
was
nothing
but
a
summary
of
the
trial
transcript,
and
provides
no
basis
for
the
trial
court
--
the
problem
with
ineffective--
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
--well,
under
the
current
system,
the
trial
judge
has
no
duty
to
make
any
anders
determination
because
the
arizona
courts
have
upheld
there
is
no
right
to
effective
appointed
counsel.
mr.
robert
d.
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
straighten
out
one
thing
--
subtly
in
the
record
about
the
facts.
this
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
am
doing
this
for
my
friend's
benefit.
harriet
levitt
was
initially
appointed
to
represent
mr.
martinez
on
appeal.
she
then
moved
to
have
herself
appointed
for
purposes
of
a
post-conviction
review,
and
it
was
at
a
later
date,
not
too
much
later,
that
she
filed
the
notice.
so
at
the
time
the
notice
was
filed,
she
was
officially
appointed
counsel
for
purposes
of
post-conviction
proceedings,
and
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
stayed
their
proceedings,
which
were
ongoing.
there
was
a
notice
of
appeal
to
allow
it
to
continue.
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
was,
the
questions
about
other
states
where
this
--
these
claims
are
handled
on
direct
appeal
illustrate
a
couple
of
things
about
our
argument:
one
is,
it
would
be
--
seem
very
peculiar
to
say
you
have
a
right
to
appointed
and
effective
counsel
in
wisconsin
or
utah
on
these
issues,
but
not
in
arizona,
where
the
label
--
that
difference
is
purely
label.
all
these
claims,
almost
all
of
them,
require
additional
evidence,
and
that
fact
makes
counsel
even
more
important.
respondents
want
to
say
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
on
review
for
almost
all
claims,
but
not
the
one
where
you
need
it
the
most.
