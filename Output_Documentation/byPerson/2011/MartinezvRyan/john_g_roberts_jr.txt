chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
case
next
in
case
10-1001,
martinez
v.
ryan.
mr.
bartels.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
how
that
works.
the
claim
is,
say
for
example,
you
were
ineffective
because
you
didn't
raise
a
batson
claim.
surely
he
gets
to
review
the
batson
claim
once
he
establishes
the
effectiveness--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
the
lawyer
--
the
state
would
be
required
to
provide
counsel
not
simply
to
raise
the
threshold
ineffectiveness
argument,
but
to
go
ahead
and
raise
the
arguments
as
to
which
he
was
ineffective.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
be
happy
with
a
system
that
said,
no,
you
don't
have
to
raise
it
in
collateral
review,
you
have
to
raise
it
on
direct
appeal,
which
is
very
unworkable,
because
if
you
are
arguing
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
a
direct
proceeding,
presumably
it's
usually
the
same
counsel;
he's
not
likely
to
bring
the
claim.
that
would
be
worse
for
criminal
defendants
than
the
system--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
there
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
person
who
decides
what
arguments
you
are
going
to
make
on
appeal
is
usually
the
person
who
handled
the
trial
in
these
types
of
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
arizona,
the
usual
case
in
criminal
cases
is
that
somebody
else
handles
the
appeal
on
direct
proceedings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cattani?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
routine,
or
does
it
happen
often
that
lawyers
who
perceive
a
trial
issue
that
can
only
be
raised
on
collateral
review
to
think
that
it
makes
sense
to
raise
that
right
away
so
that
the
appeal
--
and
then
the
appeal
is
delayed
until
that's
resolved?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
no,
you've
got
to
listen
to
the
government.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
pretty
--
it's
small
comfort
to
the
lawyer
who
--
declined,
who
doesn't
get
one,
that
everybody
else
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bartels,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
in
two
cases
this
morning.
