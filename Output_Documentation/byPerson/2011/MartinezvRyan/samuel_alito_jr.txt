justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
whenever
a
petitioner
asserts
a
claim
that
could
not
have
been
asserted
at
an
earlier
point
in
the
proceedings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
a
very
far-reaching
proposition
that
extends
well
beyond
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
many
years
after
someone
is
convicted
an
allegation
is
made
that
the
prosecution
failed
to
turn
over
exculpatory
evidence
and
that
the
information
supporting
the
claim
has
just
recently
come
to
light
and
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered,
there
would
be
a
right
to
counsel
there;
wouldn't
that
be
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
--
i'm
sorry.
what
if
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
is
closely
related
to
other
claims
that
petitioner
wants
to
raise
in
an
initial
post-conviction
relief
proceeding?
counsel
at
trial
was
ineffective
for
failing
to
do
a,
b,
c
and
d,
and
all
of
those
are
bases
for
relief.
and
now
i
want
to
argue
with
new
counsel
in
the
first
post-conviction
proceeding
not
only
that
counsel
was
ineffective
at
trial,
but
also
that
all
these
other
claims
are
meritorious.
are
you
saying
that
the
counsel
to
whom
the
petitioner
has
a
right
is
limited
to
making
only
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
and
cannot
go
on
and
represent
the
petitioner
on
these
other
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
isn't
that
where
your
argument
leads,
to
the
proposition
that
you
can
never
procedurally
default
irrevocably
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
can't
be
a
claim--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
is
exactly
that.
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere;
enough
is
enough;
it
can't
go
on
forever.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
sensible
place
to
draw
the
line
in
your
view
is
after
the
first-tier
review;
that's
your
argument,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
problem
with
that
is
you
can
answer
that
by
saying:
yes,
we
have
to
draw
a
line
someplace
and
the
court
has
already
done
that,
and
it
did
it
in
douglas
and
it
was
after
first
tier
of
review
on
direct
appeal.
it's
exactly
the
same
argument,
except
where
the
law
stands
now
the
line
is
drawn
at
a
different
place
on
the
same
principle.
it
has
to
be
drawn
someplace.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
whenever
someone
asserts
a
claim
that
couldn't
have
been
raised
earlier,
why
does
the
state
not
have
the
obligation
to
provide
counsel
to
contest
the
constitutionality
of
the
representation
that
was
provided
on
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
trial
judge
doesn't
have
to
be
wrong
for
there
to
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
at
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
cause
external
to
petitioner
to
overcome
procedural
default.
if
you
went
down
that
road,
with
petitioner
representing
himself
or
herself,
not
have
to
show
that:
i
would
have
raised
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
and
i
would
have
won
on
that
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
state
appointed
counsel
for
me
and
led
me
astray
and
prevented
me
from
raising
this
meritorious
argument.
isn't
that
where
that
would
have
to
go?
