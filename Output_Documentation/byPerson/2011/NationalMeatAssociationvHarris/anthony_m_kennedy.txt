in
that
respect,
do
state
inspectors
routinely
go
on
the
premises
of
slaughterhouses
to
ensure
that
their
coextensive
laws
are
properly
enforced?
and
if
that's
so,
are
there
problems
of
judgment,
that
a
federal
inspector
says,
no,
this
is
okay
under
federal
law
and
the
state
official
says,
no,
this
is
not
okay
under
the
state
law,
even
though
they
say
the
same
thing?
