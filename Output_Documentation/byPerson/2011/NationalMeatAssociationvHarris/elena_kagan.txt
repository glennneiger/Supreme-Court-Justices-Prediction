elena
kagan
what
if
it
weren't?
what
if
it
took
place
at
an
auction
site
apart
from
the
slaughterhouse?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
young,
you
suggested
that
even
if
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct,
there
would
still
be
a
difference
because
of
ease
of
identification.
you
can
tell
a
horse
is
a
horse
and
keep
the
horse
away
from
the
slaughterhouse.
would
it
be
possible
to
say
the
same
thing
about
nonambulatory
swine?
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
do
nonambulatory
swine
usually
become
nonambulatory
in
transit
or
at
the
slaughterhouse,
or
could
you
identify
such
swine
earlier?
justice
elena
kagan
would
it
be
possible--
justice
elena
kagan
--does
--
does
that
mean
that
a
state
could
actually
pass
a
law
and
create
a
facility,
let's
say,
that
says
--
the
law
says
the
trucks
have
to
stop
at
the
state
facility
before
it
gets
to
the
slaughterhouse,
and
at
the
state
facility,
we'll
check
to
see
whether
there
are
nonambulatory
animals,
and
make
sure
that
those
animals
don't
go
on
to
the
slaughterhouse.
would
a
state
be
within
its
rights
to
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
that
true,
ms.
smith?
i
thought
that
under
the
federal
program
some
of
these
animals
could
become
meat,
that
under
the
federal
program
you
take
a
nonambulatory
animal
and
you
say,
well,
some
of
them
might
be
condemned,
but
some
of
them
are
suspect,
and
if
they
are
only
suspect
it
may
be
that
eventually
they
will
be
turned
into
meat.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
exactly
where
the
california
system
diverges
from
the
federal
system,
because
under
the
federal
system
you
separate
the
animal
out
and
then
you
take
a
look
at
it
and
then
you
decide
whether
that
animal
can
continue
to
go
through
the
process
and
eventually
become
meat
or
whether
you
euthanize
it.
so
the
california
system
commands
an
action
that
the
federal
system
say
may
be
necessary
but
may
not
be.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
the
federal
system
has
said
maybe
they
should
be
part
of
the
meat
supply
system.
justice
elena
kagan
so
i
suppose
what
you're
saying,
ms.
smith,
is
that
california
or
any
state
is
entitled
to
take
certain
categories
of
animals
outside
of
the
whole
process,
to
exclude
certain
categories
of
animals
from
the
whole
process
and
so
to
exclude
them,
if
you
will,
from
of
the
scope
of
this
chapter.
and
much
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
a
state
can
simply
exclude
horses
from
the
scope
of
this
statute,
you're
saying
a
state
can
exclude
nonambulatory
swine
from
the
scope
of
this
statute.
but
then
you
have
to,
you
know,
ask
yourself
the
question:
are
nonambulatory
swine
so
easily
excludable
as
horses.
why
couldn't
the
state
then
exclude
swine
with
various
kinds
of
diseases?
and
then
it
would
be
clear
that
the
state
was
doing
something
that
the
federal
statute
is
supposed
to
be
doing.
justice
elena
kagan
but
suppose,
ms.
smith,
you
decided
that
the
secretary
was
not
doing
a
good
job
in
terms
of
inspecting
for
disease.
so
i
guess
that
there
is
some
disease
called
diamond
skin
disease
which
affects
a
lot
of
pigs,
and
you
just
thought
that
the
inspection
standards
were
far
too
lenient;
and
you
said,
okay
we
are
not
going
to
allow
pigs
with
diamond
skin
disease
to
be
slaughtered.
under
your
theory
you
could
do
that,
too,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
fact
it
requires
a
parallel
inspection
system.
it's
trying
to
do
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
secretary
is
trying
to
do,
which
is
trying
to
remove
animals
with
a
certain
kind
of
disease,
and
it
requires
an
inspection
system
of
its
own.
justice
elena
kagan
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
elena
kagan
and
then
i
think
that
the
cases
seem
similar
to
make.
justice
elena
kagan
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
statute
called
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
or
fmia
preempts
a
california
law
to
tell
slaughterhouses
how
to
deal
with
so-called
nonambulatory
animals,
meaning
animals
that
cannot
walk.
this
suit
is
brought
by
swine
slaughterhouses,
so
it
involves
the
application
of
the
state
law
to
nonambulatory
pigs.
the
fmia,
the
federal
law
in
this
case,
is
designed
to
ensure
both
the
safety
of
meat
and
the
humane
handling
of
animals.
it
provides
for
federal
officials
to
inspect
each
animal
brought
to
a
slaughterhouse
to
decide
whether
that
animal
can
be
made
into
food
for
human
consumption.
it
also
sets
out
rules
for
house
slaughterhouses
are
to
--
are
to
humanely
handle
animals
at
each
step
of
the
slaughtering
process.
the
fmia,
like
many
federal
statutes,
has
what's
known
as
a
preemption
clause
which
prevents
the
application
of
certain
state
laws
regulating
similar
subject
matter.
the
fmia's
preemption
clause
sweeps
broadly.
it
essentially
prevents
a
state
from
imposing
any
additional
or
different
requirements
concerning
a
slaughterhouse's
operations,
facilities
or
premises.
the
california
law
at
issue
here,
section
599f
of
the
state's
penal
code
requires
swine
slaughterhouses
immediately
to
euthanize
any
nonambulatory
pig
on
its
premises.
it
also
prohibits
slaughterhouses
from
buying
or
receiving
such
pigs
and
from
processing,
butchering
or
selling
their
meat.
we
hold
today
that
the
fmia's
preemption
clause
forecloses
operation
of
the
state
law
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
different
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
california's
law
at
every
turn
imposes
different
requirements
on
swine
slaughterhouses
than
the
fmia
does
when
it
comes
to
handling
nonambulatory
pigs.
in
essence,
california
statute
substitutes
a
new
regulatory
scheme
for
the
one
the
fmia
has
established
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
forbidden
by
the
fmia's
preemption
clause.
our
opinion
shows
in
detail
how
federal
and
state
law
differ
in
telling
slaughterhouses
what
to
do
with
nonambulatory
pigs.
we
first
look
at
the
situation
in
which
a
pig
becomes
nonambulatory
after
arrival
at
the
slaughterhouse
because
of
the
strains
of
the
slaughtering
process
itself.
in
that
circumstance,
the
state
law
instructs
slaughterhouses
to
immediately
take
the
pig
out
of
the
production
process
and
euthanize
it.
correspondingly,
the
state
law
prohibits
the
slaughterhouse
from
turning
that
animal
into
meat,
but
the
federal
law
permits
a
slaughterhouse
to
keep
nonambulatory
pigs
in
the
production
process
so
long
as
they
do
not
suffer
from
certain
serious
diseases
and
the
federal
law
also
permits
slaughterhouses
to
butcher,
process
and
sell
the
meat
of
those
animals,
subject
to
a
federal
inspector's
approval.
so,
california's
law
imposes
requirements,
the
fmia
does
not.
that's
also
true
when
a
pig
is
delivered
to
the
slaughterhouse
in
a
nonambulatory
condition,
usually
because
of
harsh
transportation
conditions.
the
california
bar
--
california
law
bars
a
slaughterhouse
from
purchasing
or
receiving
such
animals,
essentially
requiring
the
slaughterhouse
to
return
the
animals
to
their
sender.
the
federal
law
specifically
authorizes
the
slaughterhouse
to
buy
nonambulatory
animals
and
indeed
federal
law
contemplates
that
a
slaughterhouse
will
accept
custody
of
those
animals
and
send
them
through
the
normal
inspection
process,
so
here
too
the
state
law
tells
the
slaughterhouse
one
thing,
while
the
federal
law
tells
it
another.
our
opinion
considers
various
arguments
california
has
made
in
defense
of
its
statute.
the
most
fundamental
and
the
one
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
is
that
the
california
law
escapes
the
purview
of
the
fmia's
preemption
clause
because
it
regulates
only
the
kind
of
animal
that
may
be
slaughtered
rather
than
the
inspection
or
slaughtering
process
itself.
we
think
that
is
wrong.
federal
law
concerns
itself
with
this
very
same
matter.
the
fmai
--
the
fmia
operates
to
exclude
many
kinds
of
animals
from
the
slaughtering
process,
including
nonambulatory
cows.
it
is
true
enough
that
federal
law
does
not
ban
the
slaughter
of
nonambulatory
swine,
but
that
is
to
say
only
that
federal
law
and
state
law
differ,
not
that
state
law
gets
to
govern.
the
long
and
short
of
the
matter
is
this.
the
fmia
comprehensively
regulates
the
treatment
and
handling
of
nonambulatory
pigs
throughout
their
time
on
a
slaughterhouse's
premises
from
the
moment
a
delivery
truck
arrives
with
them
at
the
gate.
california's
law
regulates
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
place.
the
federal
law,
the
fmia
therefore
preempts
it.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
