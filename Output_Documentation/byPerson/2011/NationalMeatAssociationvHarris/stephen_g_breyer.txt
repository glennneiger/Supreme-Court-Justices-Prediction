justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
--
i
have
a
quick
procedural
question,
which
i
think
is
similar
to
justice
ginsburg's.
suppose
this
is
three
sections,
the
state
law,
and
some
of
them
have
three
parts.
suppose
i
thought,
well,
the
word
"buy"
--
i
mean,
"buy"
might
cover
an
awful
lot
of
things
that
don't
have
much
to
do
with
operations.
maybe
sometimes
they
do.
suppose
i
ended
up
thinking
that,
but
i
thought
you
were
right
about
all
the
rest
of
it.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
i'm
just
doing
that
hypothetically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
exactly
justice
scalia's
question.
do
we
have
to
write
an
11-part
opinion
where
we
treat
each
of
these
different
things,
which
are
different,
separately
and
analyze
it?
to
write
an
11
part
opinion
or
do
we
treat
each
of
these
differently
separately
and
analyze
it.
i'm
not
trying
to
get
out
of
work.
i
just
want
to
know.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
agree
with
you
about
that.
we
say,
if
i
agree
with
you
about
that,
there
we
are,
you're
supposed
to
pick
up
this
animal
which
is
on
the
slaughterhouse
floor
and
kill
it
right
away.
that
seems
to
have
to
do
with
operations.
all
the
rest
of
these
other
ten
provisions
are
just
variations
on
that
theme,
according
to
the
government,
and
we
send
it
back
to
them
to
argue
this
out
below.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
ten
other
parts.
there
are
ten
other
parts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
any
case
--
look,
this
is
a
simple
question
that
occurs.
i
am
an
inspector
at
a
federally
inspected
meat
facility.
i
look
around
and
there
is
a
--
a
cow
and
it's
lying
down,
all
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
law
says
i
have
to
go
over
and
see
that
it
is
immediately
euthanized.
now,
how
is
that
not
what
is
forbidden,
any
requirement
--
the
exact
words
are
--
"in
addition
to
or
different
from
the
federal
requirements
governing
the
operations
of
that
federal
meatpacking
facility.
"
the
federal
law
does
not
require
me
immediately
to
go
over
and
euthanize
the
cow.
your
law
does
require
me
to
go
over
and
immediately
euthanize
the
cow.
and
therefore,
your
law
seems
an
additional
requirement
in
respect
to
the
operations
of
a
meat
pack
--
a
federally
inspected
meatpacking
facility.
now,
that
seems
to
me
the
obvious
simple
argument
that
people
have
been
making
and
i
would
like
to
know
your
obvious
simple
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does,
you're
right.
you're
right.
i
see
where
you're
going.
it
says
we
are
talking
about
regulations
that
are
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
but
i
had
assumed
that
that
means
we
are
not
talking
about
airplanes;
we
are
talking
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
act.
and
so
is
this
the
kind
of
regulation
that
is
within
the
subject
matter
of
the
act?
and
it
seems
to
be.
it
has
to
do
with
how
you
slaughter
animals.
it
has
to
--
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
be
so
specific
as
to
say
the
only
things
that
are
within
the
scope
of
the
act
are
the
specific
requirements
that
are
there
already
in
the
federal
act,
then
this
prohibition
against
extra,
extra
regulations
means
nothing.
i
mean,
it
can't
mean
that.
so
it
just
means
the
subject
matter.
and
now
if
it
means
the
subject
matter,
then
why
don't
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean,
instead
of?
what
is
the
scope
of
the
act?
are
you
saying
the
scope
of
the
act
refers
only
to
those
particular
provisions
that
are
already
in
the
act,
requirements
already
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
then
why
did
they
put
in
something
saying
you
can't
add
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
your
argument
and
now
i
see
it.
okay.
so
i
understand
where
you're
going.
but
then
if
i
look
at
section
610
of
the
act,
it
has
a
whole
bunch
of
prohibitions,
including
prohibitions
and
references
to
how
you
slaughter
animals,
and
including
how
you
slaughter
animals
humanely.
so
there
how
do
you
say
that
this
provision
which
talks
about
euthanizing
an
animal
that
you
look
around
and
is
lying
down,
how
is
that
not
within
the
scope
of
the
act?
i'm
not
saying
that
they
have
that
particular
thing,
but
the
subject
matter,
slaughtering
animals,
indeed
humanely,
is
something
the
act
absolutely
deals
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
yes,
it's
part
of
the
operations,
but
also
it's
the
subject
matter
with
which
the
act
deals.
the
act
deals
with
the
humane
slaughter
of
animals
and
other
forms
of
slaughter
of
humane
--
of
animals.
so
how
--
how
is
--
so
i
repeat
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
--
you
see,
i--
