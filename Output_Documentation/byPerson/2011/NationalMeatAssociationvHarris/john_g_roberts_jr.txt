chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-224,
national
meat
association
v.
harris.
mr.
wells.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
your
argument
on
sales
would
apply
at
the
front
end
as
well.
you
say
sales
can't
be
regulated
because
it's
really
just
a
way
to
get
to
the
regulation
of
what
goes
on
at
the
slaughterhouse.
wouldn't
that
concern
also
apply
at
the
front
end?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
logically
not
--
doesn't
that
logically
not
follow?
"you
may
not
sell
meat
if
it's
been
adulterated.
"
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
sell
meat
so
long
as
it's
not
been
adulterated;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
is
a
limitation,
not
a
grant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
give
a
one-sentence
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
don't
--
you
don't
know
whether
they
are
going
to
become
meat
until
after
the
federal
process
of
post-mortem
inspection
and
all
of
that
and
your
rules
seem
to
prohibit
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
i
mean
your
--
your
argument
up
to
this
point
has
been
that
this
doesn't
interfere
with
the
federal
laws
because
the
federal
laws
are
designed
only
to
deal
with
meat
that
is
for
consumption.
and
you
say
with
your
--
with
respect
to
your
animals,
that's
not
what
it
is.
but
here,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
and
the
government's
position,
it
is
that
nonambulatory
animals
can
be
turned
into
meat
for
consumption.
so
you
don't
know
whether
it
fits
under
the
definition
of
the
state
law
until
you've
violated
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
is
that
because
the
act
doesn't
speak
to
whether
or
not
cats
and
dogs
and
horses
can
be
sold
as
meat,
you
can
also
say
it's
not
within
the
scope
because
it
doesn't
speak
to
specifically
whether
nonambulatory
animals
can
be
sold
as
meat
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
seems
to
me
--
what
you're
saying
then
with
respect
to
animals
that
are
slaughtered
in
a
slaughterhouse
is
that
the
difference
is
that
the
state
law
says
you
can't
sell
that
as
meat
while
the
federal
law
says
you
can.
right?
in
other
words,
you're
saying,
well,
just
because
the
federal
law
says
you
can,
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can't
say
you
can't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
correct?
well,
isn't
the
exact
flip
side
of
saying
you
can
sell
it
is
that
--
that
you
can't
sell
it,
is
that
you
can.
so
when
the
federal
law
says
you
can,
that
preempts
the
rule
from
the
states
that
says
you
can't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
purpose
does
the
ban
on
buying
and
selling
have,
other
than
to
implement
the
restrictions
that
go
to
operations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
answer,
that
no,
it
doesn't
have
anything
else
to
do
because
the
animal
cruelty
that
you're
concerned
about
takes
place
on
the
premises
as
a
result
of
the
operations.
and
so
you
prohibit
the
buying
and
selling
of
an
animal
that
wasn't
treated
the
way
you
think
it
should
be
treated,
to
give
effect
to
your
views
on
how
it
should
or
should
not
be
treated
which
seems
to
be
expressly
preempted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
it
include
besides
swine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
are
--
those
all
go
through
slaughterhouses?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wells,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
morning,
justice
kagan
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
10-224,
national
meat
association
versus
harris.
