justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
--
your
position
is
if
the
contract
for
purchase
is
consummated
in
some
way
on
premises,
that's
preempted?
and
so
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
and
justice
scalia
is
that
if
the
purchase
contract
occurs
before
the
animals
arrive
at
the
gate
of
the
slaughterhouse,
that
that
would
not
be
preempted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
your
whole
argument
is
on
express
preemption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you've
given
up
any
argument
on
implied.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please
tell
me
why
you
think
the
sale
of
the
meat
is
expressly
preempted?
the
solicitor
general
says
it's
a
closer
question
on
sale
of
the
meat
because
the
slaughterhouse
processes
--
the
law
is
involved
only
with
the
operations
and
--
of
the
premises
and
manner
of
slaughtering.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
sales.
so
why
is
the
sale
of
the
meat
preempted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
about
there
is
a
law
that
says
you
can't
slaughter
cats,
dogs
or
horses,
or
you
can't
sell
cats,
horse
--
dogs
or
horses
for
slaughter?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
for
consumption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
preempted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
a
federal
regulation
to
that
effect?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me,
if
it's
okay
for
california
to
say
you
can't
sell
a
nonambulatory
animal,
and
that
that
applies
to
everyone
off
the
slaughterhouse
premises,
is
that
--
that's
basically
your
position.
so
that
if
the
purchase
occurs
on
premises,
then
the
person
who
is
selling
it,
even
if
it's
not
the
slaughterhouse,
can
still
sell
it
on
the
premises?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
a
--
what
a
fascinating
area
of
immunity.
now
what
we're
saying
to
auction
houses
and
everyone
else
is
don't
pass
title
until
you
get
to
the
slaughterhouse.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
defines
the
scope?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
now
explain
how
under
your
definition
it's
not
among
at
least
one
of
those?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understood
that
the
federal
regulation
--
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
misunderstanding
--
is
that
if
there
is
a
suspect
animal
of
any
kind
that
it
requires
a
slaughterhouse
to
wait
until
the
federal
inspector
comes
and
finds
out
whether
it's
just
suspect
or
it's
something
that
can't
be
sold.
and
the
reason
why
the
inspection
occurs
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
are
some
diseases
that
are
so
contagious
that
if
the
inspector
decides
that
that
animal
is
carrying
that
disease
that
the
whole
lot
will
be
quarantined
or
otherwise
destroyed.
so
are
you
fighting
with
--
that
that's
what
the
purpose
of
pre-inspection
under
the
federal
system
is
for?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
having
a
hard
time
drawing
that
distinction.
if
there
is
a
valid
purpose
to
the
pre-mortem
inspection
--
and
i
can't
see
how
you
can
argue
otherwise
--
that
there
may
be
some
diseases
that
are
so
contagious
that
the
entire
lot,
ambulatory
or
nonambulatory
swine,
are
affected,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that
you
aren't
trenching
on
the
scope
of
the
statute.
if
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
to
ensure
that
meat
is
unadulterated
and
if
there
is
the
risk
of
contagion,
that
has
to
be
within
the
scope.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
define
the
scope
almost
exclusively
by
purpose
and
regulatory
power
is
broader
than
purpose.
i
mean,
as
is
reflected
by
the
regulations
here
which
are
dealing
not
merely
with
animals
that
are
adulterated,
but
are
dealing
with
the
whole
process
of
what
happens
from
the
minute
they
arrive
to
the
minute
they
are
sold.
so
if
we
don't
accept
your
limitation
based
on
a
scope
being
defined
by
purpose,
how
do
you
win?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
seem
to
be
assuming
that
in
effecting
its
obligations
that
only
when
it
finds
adulterated
meat
is
that
within
the
scope.
the
government
has
basically
said:
we
have
got
to
figure
out
if
it
is
and
this
is
how
we
are
going
to
do
it:
we
are
going
to
do
it
starting
from
the
receipt
of
the
swine
through
its
sale,
and
we
are
going
to
have
inspections
all
through
the
process,
whether
or
not
the
meat
will
ultimately
be
sold
or
not;
our
scope
is
what
happens
in
that
slaughterhouse.
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry;
you're
not
seriously
arguing
that
the
secretary
couldn't
regulate
in
the
manner
california
has?
that
the
secretary
is
powerless
under
this
act
to
say
you
can't
slaughter
animals
that
can't
walk?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
secretary
could
do
that?
