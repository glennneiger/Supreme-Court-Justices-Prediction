mr.
steven
j.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
unmistakably
ordained
that
one
set
of
rules
govern
animal
handling
and
treatment,
inspection
and
determinations
of
meat
quality
for
sale
at
federally
inspected
slaughterhouses
from
california
to
maine,
and
those
rules
kick
in
at
the
slaughterhouse
gate
and
they
continue
through
the
sale
of
the
meat
by
the
slaughterhouse.
california
has
enacted
its
own
set
of
rules
regarding
nonambulatory
animals,
rules
which
were
intended
to
be
and
are
different
than
and
in
addition
to
the
federal
rules
regarding
the
handling
of
nonambulatory
animals.
where
federal
law
sets
requirements
for
receipt
and
allows
for
receipt
if
the
--
if
those
rules
are
followed,
california
law
bans
receipt
of
the
animals
altogether.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
justice
scalia,
the
reason
that
--
the
reason
that
we
do
is
because
to
the
extent
that
purchase
is
--
is
even
relevant
with
respect
to
a
federally
inspected
slaughterhouse,
i
think
all
the
parties
agree
that
it
occurs
on
or
after
the
receipt,
so
it's
part
of
the
operational
process.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
well,
justice
kagan
i
--
because
the
scope
of
the
fmia
starts
at
the
gate
of
the
slaughterhouse
and
ends
with
sale,
california
i
think
could
regulate
and
not
--
not
have
its
regulation
be
expressly
preempted
if
it
attempted
to
prevent
purchase
before
the
purchase
occurred.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
so
long
as
the
--
so
long
as
the
contract
--
so
long
as
title
didn't
pass,
your
honor,
or
the
--
it
didn't
interfere
with
what
happens
on
the
premises
from
the
gate
through
sale,
then
i
believe
that
would
not
be
expressly
preempted
by--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--by
federal
law.
there
could
be
implied
preemption
issues,
however,
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
not
be
expressly
preempted.
again,
there
may
be
applied
preemption
issues,
but
if
the
law
--
i
think,
your
honor,
if
the
law
is
intended
to
target--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--yes,
your
honor.
absolutely
right.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
before
--
we've
not
raised
that
argument
before
this
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
right.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
your
honor,
sale
is
a
--
it
is
a
practical
step.
and
the
word
678,
i
think
all
the
parties
agree
it
encompasses
all
the
practical
steps
of
the
slaughterhouse.
sale
clearly
is
the
last
practical
step,
to
which
all
other
practical
steps
are
directed.
so
it
is
an
operational
step.
it
would
be
news
to
the
slaughterhouses
that
sales
is
not
a
part
of
their
operations.
that's--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--and
your
honor,
i'd
have
to--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--i'd
have
to
put--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--it
--
it
would
be.
well,
with
respect
to
cats
and
dogs,
the
answer
would
be
no,
because
those
are
not
an
amenable
species
that
are
subject
to
inspection
at
a
federally
inspected
slaughterhouse,
so
that's
outside
the
scope
of--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--no
--
yes.
only
amenable
species
can
be
slaughtered;
amenable
species
are
defined
at
u.s.c.
--
21
u.s.c.
section
601
subsection
(w).
and
cats
and
dogs
are
not
amenable
species,
so--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
the
definition
is
--
it's
kind
of
a
roundabout
definition,
your
honor.
amenable
species
is
--
mentions
--
i
mean,
frankly,
it
mentions
catfish
and
--
and
other
species,
and
then
all
of
the
animals
which
were
amenable
species
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
act
in
2005.
we
set
that
forth
in
footnote
11
of
our
--
our
brief
but
it
clearly
includes
swine
and
it
includes
--
it
includes
horses.
it
includes
cattle,
obviously.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
were
incorrect,
although
i
would
say
that,
even
under
the
rationale
that
the
fifth
and
seventh
circuits
used,
their
rationale
would
not
save
this
state
law.
and
the
reason
that
it
wouldn't
is,
even
if
you
were
to
decide
that
those
statutes
--
those
cases
were
decided
correctly,
the
rationale
that
the
court
used
was:
we
can
interpret
those
states'
laws
in
a
way
that
the
--
the
laws
never
have
to
affect
the
operations
of
the
slaughterhouse,
because
we
can
interpret
those
laws
to
keep
the
animals
off
the
slaughterhouse
--
off
premises.
it's
easy
to
identify
what's
a
horse
and
keep
it
off
the
premises.
that's
not
true
with
nonambulatory
animals.
nonambulatory
animals
present
with
the
symptom
of
nonambulatory-ness
on
the
premises,
or
on
the
trucks
that
are
waiting
to
arrive
on
the
premises.
so
there
is
no
way
that
this
state
law
could
be
interpreted
in
a
way
not
to
operate--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
it
clearly
has
to
do
--
this
issue
clearly
has
to
do
with
both
of
those
issues.
as
the
state
has
admitted
on
page
6
of
its
brief,
this
law
was
intended
to
address
both
--
both
humane
handling
of
animals,
which
is
covered
directly
in
section
603(b)
of
the
--
of
the
federal--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
because
congress
has
made
a
different
--
a
different
judgment,
justice
alito;
and
what
congress
has
said
is:
we
have
identified
--
we
congress
have
made
a
moral
judgment
that
the
following
species
are
amenable
and
may
be
inspected
on
slaughterhouse
premises,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
is
making
a
different
moral
judgment--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--that
--
congress
--
correct.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
congress
made
a
moral
judgment
that--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
it's
a
moral
--
it
is
a
moral
judgment
by
congress
as
to
which
animals
are
going
to
be
amenable
for
slaughter
and
which
ones
aren't.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
they
--
nonambulatory
swine
become
nonambulatory
--
may
become
nonambulatory
in
transit.
they
may
become
nonambulatory
on
the
slaughterhouse
premises.
the
only
way
that
the
slaughterhouse
operator
knows
that
an
--
that
an
animal
that
has
been
transported
has
become
nonambulatory,
however,
is
when
the
truck
is
brought
onto
the
premises,
the
gates
are
thrown
open
and
the
animals
are
shepherded
off
and
one
of
them
doesn't
move.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
could
be
a
rancher
or
a
farmer.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
congress
--
your
honor,
congress
actually
has
enacted
regulations
that
don't
--
they
don't
apply
to
slaughterhouses
because,
again,
the
scope
with
respect
to
slaughterhouses
started--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--that's
correct.
there
are
federal
--
i
should
point
out,
there
are
federal
regulations
that
govern
the
transportation
of
dead,
dying
and
diseased
animals.
they
don't
apply
to
slaughterhouses.
they
may
apply
in
the
situation
that
your
honor
is--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
your
honor,
our
argument
about
sales
is
slightly
different,
and
it's
a
little
different
than
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
the
government.
our
argument
with
respect
to
sale
is,
there
are
requirements
specifically
regulating
sale.
that's
found
in
21
u.s.c.
section
610(c).
that
says
essentially
meat
may
not
be
sold
if
it
is
adulterated
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
you
may
sell
the
meat
if
it's
unadulterated.
so
that's
a
requirement.
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
fmia;
it
--
it
goes
directly
to
sales
as
an
operation.
and
it
is
different
than
and
in
addition
to
the
state
regulation,
because
what
the
state
--
the
state
adds
another
condition.
they
say
you
may
not
sell
the
meat
if
it
is
from
a
nonambulatory
animal
or,
looked
at
the
other
way,
you
may
sell
the
meat
as
long
as
it's
not
from
a
nonambulatory
animal.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
well,
no.
i
think--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
i
think,
though,
that
there
were
--
i
think
that
--
the
federal
--
what
the
federal
government
has
done
is
established
a
requirement
for
the
sale
of
meat.
california
has
established
another
requirement
for
the
sale
of
meat.
under
federal
law,
one
requirement
for
the
sale
of
meat
is
that
it
not
be
adulterated,
that
it
pass
through
inspection,
that
it
be
stamped
usda
approved>
["],
all
of
the
conditions
that
happen
at
the
slaughterhouse.
the
state,
though,
has
set
forth
a
different
condition,
and
that
is
you
may
not
sell
that
meat
unless
it
comes
from
a
nonambulatory
animal--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--i
don't
--
your
honor,
the
short
answer
is
i
don't
know
where
those
statistics
come
from
and
to
my
knowledge
they
are
not
accurate.
but
i
don't
have
additional
statistics
to--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--i
think
that
is
a
fair
assumption,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
pigs
that
present
being
nonambulatory
when
--
when
the
doors
to
the
truck
are
opened.
i
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
that
the
practice
is
not
to
ship
nonambulatory
animals
if
you
know
beforehand
that
they
are
nonambulatory.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
no.
it
isn't
the
only
difference,
your
honor.
really,
it
--
the
--
what
i'm
really
saying
is
the
--
the
condition
of
being
nonambulatory
presents
on
the
slaughterhouse
premises
and
so
there
is
no
way
for
a
law
to
--
no
one
for
us
to
say
that
california
law
can
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
will
not
tell
a
federal
slaughterhouse
what
to
do
and
--
and
how
to
do
it
with
respect
to
nonambulatory
animals.
that's
not
true
in
the
horse
case.
in
the
horse
case,
you
can
say
keep
the
horses
out,
the
--
the
federal
slaughterhouse
doesn't
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
horses.
so--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--if
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
if
the
--
let's
say
just
for
the
shorthand,
if
title
passes
on
the
premises,
if
that's
how
it's
understood
in
the
industry
and
that's
what
it
is,
that
would
be
preempted.
but
if
the
law
took
effect--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
--well,
your
honor,
it's
just
--
i
mean,
i
think
the
--
the
real
question
is
what
has
the
federal
government
said
about
nonambulatory
animals
in
general,
and
are
those
amenable
species
and
may
they
be
--
may
they
be
slaughtered
and
turned
into
food?
and
the
federal
regulations
deal
directly
with
that
situation.
so
whether
title
passes
before
or
after,
if
the
animal
is
on
the
federal
premises,
there
are
a
whole
series
of
federal
regulations
that
tell
the
slaughterhouse
worker
exactly
what
the
worker
is
supposed
to
do
with
that
animal.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
your
honor,
the
language
of
section
603(a)
says
that
the
inspection
is
to
occur
before
they
enter
the
slaughterhouse.
now,
that
has
been
interpreted
by
the
secretary
to
essentially
mean
immediately
before,
so
--
so
trucks
in
line.
so
i
think,
under
--
under
your
honor's
hypothetical,
if
the
state
had
set
up
their
own
inspection
program
right
immediately
outside
of
a
--
of
a
federally
inspected
slaughterhouse,
that
currently
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the
fmia,
because
that's
how
the
secretary
has
defined
it.
the
further
upstream
it
goes,
though,
the
--
the
less
likely
it
is
to
be
expressly
preempted.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
that
would
not
be
expressly
preempted,
your
honor.
there
might
be
implied
preemption
issues.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining--
mr.
steven
j.
wells
thank
you.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
quick
points
to
make.
one
is
that
the
secretary
has
interpreted
the
--
section
602
and
section
603
and
section
604
to
require
that
all
animals
be
handled,
all
animals
on
the
premises
be
handled
humanely
and
that
all
animals
be
subject
to
the
regulations
under
the
chapter.
that's
set
forth
in
9
cfr
302.3
and
it's
also
set
forth
in
the
secretary's
directives,
it's
directive
6100
at
appendix
at
47.
so
the
secretary
does
not
make
a
distinction
in
implementing
section
602
through
604
between
animals
that
the
state
may
choose
to
try
to
categorically
remove.
it
applies
to
all
animals,
and
that
is
critical
because
a
state
--
a
slaughterhouse
worker
who
is
on
the
premises
needs
to
have
one
set
of
rules
that
the
worker
follows
so
that
the
worker
knows
that
if
he
follows
the
advice
of
a
federal
inspector
and,
for
example,
puts
a
nonambulatory
animal
--
separates
the
animal,
put
--
puts
it
in
a
covered
pen
and
it
--
lets
it
go
through
the
ante-mortem
inspection
that
it's
required
to
have
under
federal
law,
that
the
slaughterhouse
worker
won't
go
to
jail.
and
that's
why
it's
critical
that
--
to
congress
--
that
was
critical
to
congress
that
we
had
this
uniformity
and
i
think
it's
critical
that
this
court
find
preemption
on
this
case,
because
otherwise
federal
law
will
appear
and
disappear,
apparently
based
on
when
the
state
believes
that
it's
removing
animals
from
--
in
connection
with
slaughter,
whenever
that
would
occur.
just
one
other
point
and
that
is,
it
is
also
crystal
clear
that
the
human
methods
of
slaughter
act
of
1978
incorporated
the
standards
of
humane
treatment
that
were
included
in
the
human
methods
of
slaughter
act
of
1958,
and
it
isn't
just
the
preamble
to
that
public
law
that
indicates
that.
those
requirements
are
found
now
in
21
u.s.c.
section
603(b)
and
they
are
backed
up
by
prohibitions
which
are
backed
up
by
criminal
penalties
in
section
--
in
21
u.s.c.
section
610
--
yes,
610(b).
and
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i'll
conclude
my
remarks.
mr.
steven
j.
wells
thank
you.
