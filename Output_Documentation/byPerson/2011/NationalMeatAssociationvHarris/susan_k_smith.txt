ms.

k.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
be
preempted
here,
the
state
provisions
have
to
be
--
excuse
me
--
the
state
law
provisions
have
to
be
within
the
scope
of
the
act
and
with
respect
to
the
premises,
facilities,
and
operations.
none
of
the
state
provisions
are
within
the
scope
and
some
are
not
even
operations.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
the
scope
are
the
mandates
of
federal
law
dealing
with
the
method,
quality,
and
marketing
of
turning
animals
into
meat
for
human
consumption.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
none
of
the
provisions
are
within
the
scope
because
california
is
not
regulating
animals
that
are
going
to
be
turned
into
meat.
and
the
federal
meat
inspection
act,
the
purpose
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
show,
that
the
scope
of
the
act
is
concerned
with
animals
that
are
going
to
become
meat.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
that
is
correct.
but
the
entire
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
inspect
and
examine
animals
to
determine
whether
or
not
their
meat
will
be
wholesome
and
unadulterated.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
the
humane
treatment
of
the
animals
deals
with
animals
in
the
connection
of
slaughter
or
while
being
slaughtered.
and
the
animals
that
california
is
regulating,
the
nonambulatory
animals
that
we're
withdrawing
from
the
process,
will
not
be
slaughtered,
will
not
be
turned
into
meat.
even
the--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--well,
the
language
of
the
regulations,
the
federal
regulations
dealing
with
u.s.
condemned
animals,
for
instance,
say
that
u.s.
condemned
animals
shall
be
killed
and
shall
not
be
slaughtered
and
dressed
in
the
same
facility
with
animals
that
will
be
turned
into
meat.
so
even
in
the
regulations
there
is
a
distinction
between
animals
that
will
be
slaughtered
for
meat
and
that
will
be
edible
and
ones
that
are
--
are
condemned--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--and
will
be
killed.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it
applies
to
--
well,
specifically
the
provisions
in
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
apply
to
the
animals
that
are
going
to
be
turned
into
meat.
to
the
extent
that
they
apply
to
other
animals
or
all
animals
as
has
been
referenced,
they
would
be
pursuant
--
those
provisions
would
be
pursuant
to
the
humane
methods
of
slaughter
act,
which
is
--
does
not
have
a
preemption
clause
and
does
not--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--correct.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it
applies
to
the
humane
provision
with
animals
--
with
respect
to
the
animals
in
connection
with
slaughter
and
that
will
be
slaughtered,
with
respect
to
the
federal
meat
inspection
act.
because
the
humane
methods
of
slaughter
act
was
not
incorporated
into
the
federal
meat
inspection
act,
it
does
not
have
an
express
preemption
clause,
and
there
is
no
language
in
the
text
of
that
act,
the
humane
methods
act,
or
in
the
legislative
history
showing
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
federalize
animal
cruelty
law,
for
instance.
so
the
idea
that--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--correct.
603
and
610
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
reference
the
humane
methods
act
and
reference
that
that
is
to
be
applied
when
the
animals
are
in
the
--
being
processed
in
the
connection
with
slaughter
and
being
slaughtered.
so
again,
it
is
--
it
is
limited
to
the
animals
that,
that
are
going
to
become
meat
under
the
federal
meat
inspection
act.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
our
rules
--
well
the
ante-mortem
inspection
and
post-mortem
inspection
are
required
of
animals
that
are
going
to
be
turned
into
meat,
correct.
and
our
--
the
california
law
does
not
touch
on
post-mortem
inspection
at
all.
and
only
in
the
case
--
excuse
me.
and
as
far
as--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--no,
because
when
an
animal
becomes
nonambulatory
it
is
readily
apparent.
that's
a
characteristic
that
is
readily
apparent.
and
in
--
at
least
in
california,
when
the
animal
becomes
nonambulatory
the
requirement
would
be
to
immediately
euthanize
the
animal
because
it's
not
part
of
the
meat
supply
system.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it
commands
an
action,
but
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
act,
because
at
the
very
outset
california
is
saying
that
these
animals
are
not
to
be
part
of
the
meat
supply
system
in
california.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
they
may
be
part
of
the
meat
supply
system,
but
it's
not
required.
it's
not
--
nonambulatory
animals
are
not--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--certainly,
your
honor.
the
euthanization
is
an
operation
of
the
slaughterhouse.
but
this,
california's
provision,
is
not
within
the
scope.
and
pursuant
to
678,
to
be
expressly
preempted
it
has
to
be
within
the
scope
and
with
respect
to
operations.
so
with
respect
to
that
provision,
the
euthanization
provision,
we
concede
that
it
is,
it
is
part
of
the
operations.
but
it
is
not
within
the
scope
because
we
are
dealing
with
an
animal
that
california
has
deemed
as
not
part,
as
--
excuse
me--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--the
distinction
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
ante-mortem
inspection
is
to
determine
if
the
--
if
the
animal's
meat
will
be
wholesome
and
unadulterated.
to
the
extent
that
the
pre-inspection
or
the
inspection
also
finds
diseases
that
can
be
passed
on
to
other
animals
or,
or
to
the
rest
of
the
herd,
that's
--
that's
certainly
a
benefit,
but
it's
not
part
of
the
purpose
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
two
points.
one,
the
diseases
that
were
referenced
by
the
amicus
dealing
with
this
are
diseases
that
will
be
passed
to
the
animals,
not
to
humans.
and
the
second
point
is
that
the
--
the
purpose
again
of
the
act
as
specified
in
602
is
to
make
sure
that
the
meat
of
the
animal
is
wholesome
and
unadulterated.
and
the
ante-mortem
inspection
will
occur
for
every
animal
that
goes
into
the
meat
supply
system.
so
if
california
withdraws
a
nonambulatory
animal,
it
doesn't
receive
the
ante-mortem
inspection,
it's
not
going
into
the
meat
supply
system.
but
all
of
the
other
animals
in
that
pen
that
are
ambulatory,
pursuant
to
the
federal
law
will
receive
that
ante-mortem
inspection
and
will
by
the
inspector,
the
veterinarian,
be
declared
disease
free
or
not.
so
they
will
find
--
they
will
be
able
to
find
those
diseases
in
the
ambulatory
animals
and
the
ones
that
are
going
into
the
meat
supply
system.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
your
honor,
if
your
question
is,
would
that
be
preempted
if
california
excluded
pursuant
to
other
diseases,
it
would
not
be
expressly
preempted.
so
california
can
make
decisions
on
categories
of
animals,
here
nonambulatory
swine,
and
the
express
--
it
would
not
be
expressly
preempted.
there
may
be
questions
about
conflict
preemption,
but
in
this
particular
case,
conflict
preemption
was
litigated
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
no
conflict
preemption.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it's
not
expressly
preempted
because
it's
not
within
the
scope,
because
california
is
not
putting
requirements
on
animals--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--because
the
scope
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
does
not
include
every
animal
on
the
premises
of
a
slaughterhouse.
it's
limited
by
the
language
of
the
text
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
and
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
california
would
--
there
is
no
requirement
in
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
federal
act
that
specifies
that
states
cannot
withdraw
animals
based--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--correct.
but
that
is
--
no
additional
requirements
going
to
animals
that
are
going
to
become
meat.
if
california
--
if
california
had
a--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--because
it's
also
within
the
scope.
within
the
scope
is
part
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
678.
the
express
preemption
clause
references
within
the
scope
of
the
chapter
with
respect
to
premises,
facilities,
and
operations.
so
there
--
the
scope
of
the
chapter
must
be
considered
in
terms
of
what
the
purpose
is,
what
the
language
of
the
text
allows
the
federal
government
to--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--correct,
and
since
mr.--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--correct.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
well,
the
federal
law
doesn't
say
you
must.
it
does
not
say
you
must
sell
the
meat
or
you
must--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--because
the
"no
additional
requirements"
has
to
be
qualified
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
this
--
well,
even
if
one
looks
at
the
subject
matter
instead
of
the
scope
of
the
act--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--yes,
the
scope
of
the
act--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--because
the
"in
addition
to"
is
qualified
by
on
the
--
"with
respect
to
the
premises,
facilities,
and
operations
and
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
"
ms.
susan
k.
smith
if
one
looks
at
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary
as
well
in
621,
the
authority
is
specified
as
dealing
with
--
or
making
sure
that
no
adulterated
meat
or
any
carcass,
part
of
carcass,
meat
food
product,
therefore
is
not
adulterated.
so
the
focus
in
621
on
the
secretary's
authority
is
on
making
sure
that
the
--
that
the
meat
is
not
adulterated.
so
--
so
it's
not
simply
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
act
at
602,
but
also
the
scope
of
the
authority
given
to
the
secretary.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
correct.
but
the
--
the
focus
of
the
secretary's
authority,
as
well
as
the
specified
purpose
of
the
act,
is
focused
on
not
all
animals,
but
animals
that
will
eventually
become
meat
and
making
the
determination
by
inspections
or
examinations,
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
those
swine
or
those
meat
will
be
wholesome
and
not
adulterated.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it
--
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
euthanization
it's
certainly
part
of
the
operations.
is--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--it
deals
with
animals
in
connection
with
slaughter
and
that
will
be
slaughtered,
and
so
to
the
extent
that
that
--
that
slaughter
is
seen
as
an
animal
that
is
going
towards
the
meat
supply
system,
as
opposed
to
one
that's
condemned
and
being
killed
and
not
--
not--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--and
as
--
as
i
mentioned,
the
secretary
is
given
in
several
--
several
different
points
authority
to
act
under
this
chapter,
and
the
secretary's
authority
is
--
is
circumscribed
to
making
sure
that
meat
is
not
adulterated
and
setting
up
inspections--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--no.
the
secretary
has
done--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--yes.
the
secretary
--
yes.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
no,
we
don't.
our
--
our
focus
is
on
--
on
the
scope
of
the
act
and
not
on
requirements.
we
--
we
concede
that
the
--
that
california
statute
is
setting
out
requirements,
the
requirements
in
the
penal
code
dealing
with
animal
cruelty
in
--
in
areas
traditionally
regulated
by
the
state.
so
we
--
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
--
the
provisions
in
the
state
law
are
requirements.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
yes,
we
could
because
we
would
be
categorically
withdrawing
the
animal
from
--
form
the
process.
i
want
to
be
clear,
though,
we
are
not
--
with
this
law
we
are
not
setting
up
an
inspection
and
examination
process.
it's
--
this
provision
is
in
the
penal
code.
it's
an
animal
--
it's
within
the
animal
cruelty
statutes.
it
is
not
an
attempt
to--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--in
our
--
our
case
or
your
hypothetical?
ms.
susan
k.
smith
in
your
hypothetical--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--well,
it
--
it
would
not
be
expressly
preempted,
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given
me
because
we
are
withdrawing
these
animals
within
the
scope
of
the
act.
there
may
be
questions
about
conflict
preemption
in
that
--
in
that
example,
but
with
respect
to
what
we
are
doing,
what
the
california
provision
is
doing
there,
it's
not
setting
up
a
parallel
provision.
it's
not
trying
to
set
up
a--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--let
me
be
precise
about
--
if
one
saw,
if
one
saw
that
--
that
paragraphs
(b)
and
(c)
of
the
california
law
were
within
the
scope,
there
is
still
an
argument
that
they
have
to
be
with
--
part
of
the
operations,
the
premises,
facilities
and
operations.
and
certainly
with
respect
to
requirement
(a),
the
buying,
selling
and
the
sale
of
meat,
those
are
not
necessarily
operations;
and
we
do
dispute
the
--
the
factual
assertion
that's
been
made
that
all
purchasing
happens
on
the
--
on
the
slaughterhouse
grounds.
there
is
no
--
no
factual
record
of
that
in
the
--
in
the
lower
record.
we
have
no
way
to
dispute
that
because
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
litigated.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
we
believe
the
--
the
law
could
or
would
be
severable.
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
preliminary
injunction
went
to
all
provisions
except
for
subparagraph
(e).
we
would
--
have
to
litigate
severability,
of
course,
but
we
do
think
that
it
would
be
severable,
and
it
seems
that
the
ninth--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--well,
the
purpose
of
the
california
law
is
twofold.
one,
general
public
health,
but
there
is
also
a
very
strong
component
of
prohibiting
animal
cruelty;
and
so
prohibiting
the
purchase,
buying,
selling
or
the
sale
of
meat--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--well,
not
necessarily,
because
the
law
--
if
we
look
at
the
entire
california
penal
code
section
it's
dealing
not
just
with
slaughterhouses.
so
it
is
trying
to
deal
with
a
comprehensive
problem
that
it
sees
with
respect
to
nonambulatory
animals,
not
just
at
the
slaughterhouse
but
at
other
market
agencies,
etcetera
--
and
livestock
agencies
and
so
--
so
the
focus
on
purchasing,
buying,
receipt,
selling
of
the
meat
is
to
prohibit
and
--
and
stop
the
--
the
commerce
in
nonambulatory
animals.
and
--
and
california's
purpose
there
as
i
said
was
twofold,
to
one,
protect
general
public
health
but
also
to
prohibit
animal
cruelty
in
an
area
where
--
where
california
legislators
were
concerned
about
the
humane
treatment
of
nonambulatory
animals,
not
--
not
just
swine
because
the
law
is
broader
than
that,
but
that's
what's
at
issue
here
today.
ms.
susan
k.
smith
it
includes
cattle,
sheep,
goats
and
swine,
and
the
preliminary
injunction
was
brought--
ms.
susan
k.
smith
--they
do.
they
do.
and--
