justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what's
that
definition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
seventh
circuit
and
--
and
i
forget
what
the
other
circuit
--
was
were
incorrect
in
saying
that
the
--
that
the
state
could
prohibit
the
slaughter
of
horses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
it
seem
strange
to
hold
that
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
speaks
to
an
issue
like
that?
this
doesn't
have
anything
--
whether
or
not
horses
should
be
slaughtered
and
sold
and
their
meat
should
be
sold
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
food
safety,
does
it?
and
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
humane
treatment,
assuming
the
same
methods
of
slaughter
are
used?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
wasn't
speaking
of
the
california
law.
i
was
speaking
of
the
law
that
prohibits
the
--
the
slaughter
of
horses.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
based
just
on
a
judgment,
a
societal
judgment
that
this
is
an
animal
that
should
not
be
slaughtered
and
sold
for
food.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
any
of
the
purposes
of
the
federal
meat
inspection
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
--
isn't
it
the
case
that
most
nonambulatory
animals
become
nonambulatory
because
of
the
method
of
transportation
that's
used?
do
you
dispute
the
statistics
in
the
brief
of
the
non-state
respondent
that
--
respondents
that
--
nationwide,
approximately
220,000
swine
die
during
transport,
another
440,000
become
nonambulatory
during
the
transportation
process?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
the
--
that
ranchers
generally
do
not
ship
animals
that
are
nonambulatory
at
the
time
when
the
trip
begins,
but
that
most
of
these
nonambulatory
animals
become
nonambulatory
during
the
transportation
process?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
think
it's
difficult
to
identify
which
animals
are
nonambulatory?
that's
the
difference
between
horses,
that's
--
between
prohibiting
the
slaughter
of
horses,
because
you
can
tell
whether
it's
a
horse
or
a
pig,
but
you
can't
tell
whether
a
pig
can
walk?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
they
do
it
at
the
weigh
station
the
truck
has
to
stop
at
when
it
enters
the
state,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
you
get
to
that
point,
the
animal
has
to
be
transported.
does
federal
law
regulate
for
humane
purposes
the
transportation
of
animals
to
slaughterhouses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
federal
--
if
congress
has
not
chosen
to
regulate
the
transportation
of
animals
to
prevent
inhumane
treatment
in
transit,
why
should
a
state
law
that
aims
at
that
objective
be
preempted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
state
could
inspect
the
trucks
at
a
weigh
station
before
they
get
to
the
slaughterhouse,
why
can't
they
do
the
same
thing
when
they
get
to
the
slaughterhouse,
where
it's
more
practical
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
dispute
--
you
dispute
that?
