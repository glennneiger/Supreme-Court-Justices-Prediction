mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
haven't
heard
any
quarrel
this
morning
with
the
proposition
that
if
an
animal
goes
down,
say,
as
it's
entering
the
abattoir
to
be
slaughtered,
that
the
state
cannot
at
that
point
tell
the
slaughterhouse
how
it
is
to
handle
that
animal.
but
that
is
not
any
different,
of
course,
than
the
situation
where
a
pig
goes
down
as
it's
coming
off
the
truck,
or
it
presents
as
nonambulatory
when
the
gates
of
the
truck
are
open,
because
it's
still
an
operational
consideration;
the
same
humane
handling
requirements
still
apply.
it's
still
a
state
requirement
and
it's
not
--
it's
still
different
from
the
federal
requirements.
so
the
court's
questions
this
morning
i
think
have
gone
to
kind
of
the
situations
at
the
margins,
at
the
extreme.
so
let
me
try
to
--
try
to
address
some
of
those
questions.
the
--
the
question
about
whether
--
the
question
about
the
purchase
of
the
nonambulatory
animal
and
the
regulation,
the
regulation
there,
the
first
thing
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
you
have
to
think
about
it
in
a
concrete
situation,
which
is
that
there
is
a
nonambulatory
animal
that's
on
the
slaughterhouse
premises.
that's
the
hypothetical
that
we
are
in.
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
slaughterhouse
employee
to
do
with
that
animal.
and
the
state
law
says
well,
you
can't
buy
it,
you
can't
hold
it,
you
can't
receive
it,
you
can't
turn
it
into
meat,
and
you
have
to
immediately
euthanize
it.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
there
are
federal
laws
regarding
transportation.
the
federal
meat
inspection
act
has
not
been
interpreted
by
the
secretary
to
apply
specifically
to
trucks
that
are
in
transit,
although
i
should
say
that
the
secretary
has,
for
example,
interpreted
the
fmia
--
and
this
is
in
part
309.1(b)
to
apply,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
humane
handling,
to
pens
at
stockyards
that
are
committed
exclusively
to
a
slaughterhouse.
and
i
think
if
there
were
a
situation
such
as
i
think,
justice
kagan,
your
hypothetical
envisioned,
where
a
state
determined
that
it
wanted
to
essentially
assert
an
inspection
jurisdiction
over
animals
that
were
in
transit
to
a
slaughterhouse,
so
essentially
between
the
pen
and
the
slaughterhouse,
the
secretary
might
well
recognize
that
--
that
his
authority
needs
to
extend,
needs
to
extend
to
those,
because
the
purpose
of
the
act,
after
all,
is
to
set
a
federal
inspection
standard
for
animals
to
determine
if
they
are
suitable
to
be
turned
into
meat.
and
in
your--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
if
you
--
if
you
disagree
with
--
if
you
disagree
with
me
about
the
scope
of
the
fmia
in
that
regard,
the
state
law
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
the
animals
while
they
are
in
transit
wouldn't
be
preempted.
but
of
course
the
injunction
that
i
understand
petitioners
to
be
seeking
is
not
one
that
goes
to
state
regulation
of
trucks,
but
rather
to
state
regulation
of
animals
that
are
on
the
slaughterhouse
premises.
and
the
secretary
has
made
unmistakably
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
fmia
is
at
least
as
large
as
the
official
slaughter
establishment's
premises.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
accepting
the
premise
of
your
hypothetical
that
the
state
could
do
the
inspection
on
the
truck--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
dispute
that,
but
i'll
accept
that
premise.
even
if
i
accept
that
premise,
the
question
here
is
different
because
the
secretary
has
drawn
a
line
that
says
the
scope
of
the
fmia
--
and
that's
--
the
question
is
the
scope
of
federal
law
here.
that's
in
section
678.
the
secretary
has
made
very
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
fmia
extends
to
--
to
all
animals
that
are
on
the
premises
of
the
establishment.
that's
--
you
can
look
at
appendix--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
state
laws
of
general
applicability
would,
to
the
extent
they
don't
in
some
particular
application
introduce
into
the
scope
of
the
fmia,
they
would
apply.
and
i
also
want
to
be
very
clear,
so
that
there's
no
mistaking
the
government's
position:
state
prosecutions
for
animal
cruelty
are
not
preempted
to
the
extent
they
are
prosecuting
conduct
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
law,
because
that
is
--
that
is
an
example
of
a
state
that
is
not
applying
a
different
or
an
additional
standard
of
conduct,
but
simply
adding
--
applying
its
own
sanction
for
conduct
that
federal
law
would
similarly
sanction.
so
there
is
absolutely
room
for
state,
the
application
of
state
law
on
the
premises
of
the
slaughterhouse.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i'm
--
i
am
not
aware
that
in
general
state
inspectors
or
other
state
officials
would
go
to
the
federally
inspected
premises
as
a
general
matter.
but
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
were
and
then
your
question
--
excuse
me
--
presents
the
question
about
these
sort
of
differences
in
judgment
that
might
be
made.
the
federal
regulations
generally
provide
that
the
disposition
made
by
veterinarians,
by
federal
veterinarians,
is
the
conclusive
judgment
of
the
secretary
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
animal
for
turning
into
meat.
and
so
in
that
situation,
the
state
official
would
not
be
able
to
reach
a
different
judgment
on
that
question.
and
so
i
--
so
i
think
that
would
resolve
any
situation
where
state
officials
were
there.
of
course,
the
situation
where
state
officials
do
inspections
is
the
one
that
the
act
itself
envisions
and
that
california
has
not
taken
the
opportunity
to
implement,
which
is
for
intrastate-only
plants
states
can
enact
their
own
inspection
regulations
and
have
their
own
inspectors
there
as
long
as
they
are
following
federal
standards
at
a
minimum.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
to
take
issue
with
your
premise.
but
the
answer
your
question--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
this
case
comes
here
on
preliminary
injunction,
so
i
think
the
court
could
appropriately
articulate
its
answer
and
its
understanding
of
the
different
provisions,
and
that
probably
would
then
lead
to
the
lower
courts
working
out
the
particulars
of
the
injunction.
but
let
me
actually
make
a
point
in
that
regard
about
what
the
injunction
might
or
might
not
look
like
with
respect
to
the
buying
provision,
which
is
that
i
don't
understand
the
state
to
have
some
free-floating
interest
in
when
title
or
does
not
pass.
the
state
is
interested
in
regulating
what
animals
can
be
purchased
because
of
a
background
principle
of
state
law
that
i
assume
exists,
that
slaughterhouses
can't
slaughter
things
they
don't
own.
and
if
you
put
those
two
pieces
together,
the
ban
on
buying
is
nothing,
is
nothing
but
doing
in
two
steps
what
the
state
clearly
can't
do
in
one
step,
which
is
tell
slaughterhouses
how
they
are
to
deal
with
an
animal
that
is
on
their
premises.
at
least
they
can't
--
states
can't
tell
slaughterhouses
how
to
do
that
when
there
is
a
federal
regulation
on
the
subject.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
think
the
court
could,
could
do
that,
although
i
think
there
is
some
concern
that
if
the
court
were
to
find
--
to
have
some
concern
with
some
specific
aspects
of
the
injunction
--
and
i
guess
i
would
let
petitioner's
counsel
speak
to
this
--
there
would
be
some
concern
that
vacating
the
injunction
so
that
it
could
be
corrected
would
leave
the
--
the
petitioner
in
a
spot
where
it
wouldn't
have
protection
from
the
vast
majority
of
provisions.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
court--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--the
right
way
to
get
out
of
the
work
would
be
to
understand
that
--
that
california
has
made
every
effort
here
to
implement
a
provision
that
--
to
implement
one
underlying
requirement,
which
is
that
it
wants
to
tell
slaughterhouses:
don't
turn
these
animals
into
food
immediately;
euthanize
them
instead,
and
the
rest
of
these
are
just
ways
of
implementing
that
underlying
requirement.
and
this
answers
your
question--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--if
there
would
be
anything
left
to
argue
out
below
at
that
point.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
there
are
the
ten
points,
but
i
actually
want
to
answer
--
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
think
i
can.
--justice
sotomayor's
question,
which
is
about
the
sale
of
the
meat,
which
again
i
think
fits
under
the
rubric
that
it's
just
implementing
the
underlying
prohibition
that
california
seeks
here.
