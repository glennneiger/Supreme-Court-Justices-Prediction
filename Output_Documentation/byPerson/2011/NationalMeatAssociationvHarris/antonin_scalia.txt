justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
purchase?
what
about
--
what
about
the
contract
to
purchase?
the
california
law
addresses
that.
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
that
is
preempted
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
contract
of
purchase.
i
mean,
if
the
contract
of
purchase
is
made
apart
from
the
slaughterhouse
itself,
they
--
they
could
make
it
unlawful
for
the
--
the
person
who
raises
the
animals
to
sell
them
when
they
are
nonambulatory
and
unlawful
for
the
slaughterhouse
to
contract
to
buy
them,
right,
so
long
as
the
contract
is
off
the
premises?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
presumably
is
why
congress
excluded
cats
and
dogs?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
lassie
--
lassie
and
kitty
are
no
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
dobbin
is
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
i
guess
the
--
the
state
could
make
it
unlawful
for
a
rancher
--
or
--
what
are
the
people
that
ship
the
animals,
do
you
call?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
rancher
or
farmer;
could
make
it
unlawful
for
them
to
ship
a
--
a
nonambulatory
swine,
could
--
could
they
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
as
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
it
would
not
preclude
a
state
law
that
forbids
a
--
a
rancher
to
--
to
ship
a
nonambulatory
swine,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
peel
this
onion
in
order
to
decide
this
case?
do
we
have
to
go
through
each
little
provision
of
the
statute
and
say,
this
is
in,
this
is
out,
this
is
in,
this
is
out?
can't
we
just
either
affirm
or
reverse
the
particular
preliminary
injunction
that
was
--
that
was
issued
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
get
out
of
the
work,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
no.
provisions
of
the
act,
at
least
as
amended,
also
require
humane
treatment
of
the
animals
while
they
are
being
processed.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
meat
is
any
good.
it
has
to
do
with
humane
treatment
of
the
animals.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
you
mean
the
federal
requirements
of
humane
treatment
do
not
apply
once
the
slaughterhouse
decides
that
this
animal
will
not
be
slaughtered
for
meat;
then
the
slaughterhouse
can
do
whatever
it
wants
with
the
poor
animal?
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
provision
that
says
that
they
will
not
be
exposed
to
sharp
--
sharp
instruments
that
can
injure
them?
does
that
apply
to
only
those
that
are
going
to
be
sold
for
meat.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
no.
but
that
act
amends,
amends,
the
act
that
does
have
a
preemption
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
the
preemption
clause
applies
to
the
humane
provisions
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
in
slaughterhouses.
i
mean,
to
the
extent
it's
incorporated
in
that
act,
it
only
applies
to
humane
treatment
by
slaughterhouses,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
an
additional
requirement.
i
don't
know
why
it's
conflict
preemption.
it's
express
preemption.
if
indeed
the
federal
regulations
say
that
these
diseases
disqualify
the
animal
from
being
slaughtered
and
sold
as
meat,
and
california
says
no,
we
think
additional
diseases
should
disqualify
the
slaughter
and
sale,
that's
an
additional
requirement.
i
don't
know
how
you
say
that's
somehow
conflict
preemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
keep
saying
"not
within
the
scope".
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"not
within
the
scope".
why
is
it
not
within
the
scope?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
what
--
what
limits
it?
what
enables
the
state
to
disqualify
other
diseases
that
the
federal
law
does
not
disqualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
"no
additional
requirements"
is
what
the
act
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
"no
additional
requirements"
with
respect
to
all
of
the
operations,
both
the
operations
that
pertain
to
those
animals
that
are
later
sold
as
meat
and
the
operations
that
pertain
to
those
animals
that
are
slaughtered
and
whose
carcasses
are
burned
or
disposed
of.
how
do
you
get
the
limitation
to
only
those
animals
that
are
--
that
are
slaughtered
for
meat?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
not
talking
about
conflict
preemption.
if
it
said
you
must
and
the
state
says
you
can't,
then
there
would
be
conflict
preemption.
but
we
are
talking
about
express
preemption,
which
says
in
so
many
words
no
additional
requirements.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
can
get
around
the
fact
that
this
is
an
additional
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
what
within
the
scope
means.
the
preemption
provision
here
in
the
statute
has
two
provisions.
the
first
one
which
is
the
one
we
are
talking
about
says
requirements
within
the
scope
of
this
chapter
with
respect
to
premises,
facilities
and
operations
which
are
in
addition
to
or
different
than
those
made
under
this
chapter
may
not
be
imposed.
that's
the
first
one,
okay?
requirements
within
the
scope
with
respect
to
premises,
facilities.
now
the
second
preemption
provision
reads:
"marking,
labeling,
packaging
or
ingredient
requirements
in
addition
to
or
different
than
those
made
under
this
chapter.
"
now,
i
--
i
read
the
difference
between
those
two
being,
under
number
two
it
has
to
be
different
from
something
that
has
been
made,
whereas
under
number
one
it
just
has
to
be
different
from
anything
that
could
have
been
made
under
this
chapter.
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
chapter.
it's
within
the
secretary's
authority
to
prescribe
under
this
chapter.
i
think
that's
what
congress
meant
by
the
difference
between
requirements
within
the
scope
and
in
number
two,
"in
addition
to
or
different
than
those
made.
"
and
that
to
my
mind
is
--
is
a
much
more
plausible
explanation
of
"within
the
scope"
than,
you
know,
it's
directed
to
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
within
the
scope
has
anything
to
do
with
the
purpose.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
act
in
this
field
under
the
chapter.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
argument
is
that
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
act
because
it
is
preeminently
something
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
regulate,
this
nefarious
diamond
skin
disease
which
we
are
all
familiar
with.
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
act,
because
he
could
act
and
indeed
is
--
is
told
to
act
to
prevent
stuff
like
that.
and
that's
why
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
act
for
california
to
do
something
in
addition
to
what
he
has
chosen
to
do.
and
that's
why
there
is
a
difference
between
one
and
two,
requirements
within
the
scope,
and
marketing
labeling
and
packaging
requirements
in
addition
to
or
different
from
those
made.
this
one
isn't
made
but
it
is
within
the
scope
of
what
the
secretary
could
make,
and
therefore
california
should
butt
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
agree
with
you
on
that
but
don't
agree
with
you
--
or
least
i'm
dubitante
on
that
and
--
and
disagree
with
you
on
the
rest.
what
do
i
do?
