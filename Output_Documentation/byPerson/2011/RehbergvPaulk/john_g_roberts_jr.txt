we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-788,
rehberg
v.
paulk.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
--
a
person?
what
--
what
if
you
have
three
elements
to
a
crime,
and
you
have
one
witness
for
each
one.
you
see
somebody
sees
the
guy
trying
to
get
into
a
car.
well,
maybe
he
left
it
--
maybe
he
locked
his
keys
in.
another
sees
the
guy
walking
around
with
a
television.
it
might
be
his.
a
third
sees
the
guy
selling
the
television
to
somebody
else.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
each
one
testifies
before
the
grand
jury.
who
is
the
complaining
witness?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
urges,
urges
a
prosecution.
one
area
that
causes
me
concern
here
are
the
domestic
violence
cases,
where
someone
may
well
report
an
episode,
but
by
the
time
it
gets
to
whatever
the
indictment
procedure
is,
a
grand
jury
or
otherwise,
is
unwilling
to
--
to
testify
and
pursue
it.
and
yet
that
person
may
be
the
one
who
started
the
prosecution
in
motion.
is
that
individual
a
complaining
witness?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
he
says
--
he
or
she
says
at
the
time,
i
--
i
don't
want
prosecution
to
go
forward.
i
--
you
know,
i
would
prefer
that
it
not
go
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
grand
jury
was
to
protect
citizens
from
unwarranted
prosecutions.
the
grand
jury
initiates
the
prosecution.
so
why
do
we
look
back
beyond
that?
that's
where
the
prosecution
is
initiating.
you
are
not
subject
to
prosecution
until
the
grand
jury
returns
the
indictment.
so
why
do
we
talk
about
complaining
witnesses
initiating
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
somebody's
is
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-788,
rehberg
versus
paulk.
