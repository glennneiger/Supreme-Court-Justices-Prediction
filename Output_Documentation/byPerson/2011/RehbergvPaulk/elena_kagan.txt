justice
elena
kagan
but
do
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--in
a
case
where
the
prosecutor
is
the
prime
mover,
can
there
ever
be
a
complaining
witness?
where
the
prosecutor
is
making
the
decisions,
can
there
ever
be
a
complaining
witness?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
make
sure
i
understand
what
you
just
said,
mr.
pincus.
when
you
said
it
can't
be
the
testimony
alone,
is
that
right,
that
there
have
to
be
other
acts
exclusive
of
the
testimony
that
make
somebody
a
complaining
witness?
justice
elena
kagan
rely
on
testimony,
but
rely
on
testimony
exclusively;
do
you
have
he
a
cases
that
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
jones,
do
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--so,
mr.
jones,
could
i
understand
your
responses
to
these
questions,
because
you
said
to
justice
scalia
the
fact
that
there's
been
testimony
at
the
grand
jury
does
not,
if
you
will,
immunize
the
person
from
suit
based
on
other
acts.
can
you
go
further?
in
a
suit
based
on
other
acts,
could
the
grand
jury
testimony
come
in
as
evidence?
justice
elena
kagan
so
all
you
are
saying
is
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
for
a
suit
based
exclusively
on
grand
jury
testimony,
and
if
the
suit
is
based
on
something
else
the
grand
jury
testimony
can
come
in.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
jones,
i
feel
as
though
now
we
are
just
arguing
about
facts.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
accepted
a
good
deal
of
mr.
pincus's
case.
you've
said
that
you
can
bring
an
action
against
somebody
based
on
acts
outside
of
court,
that
the
grand
jury
testimony
can
come
in
as
evidence
in
that
action,
and
all
you're
saying
is
that
there's
--
there's
no
way
to
bring
this
action
in
this
case
because
your
client
didn't
in
fact
do
anything.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
this
a
jurisdiction
that
didn't
have
grand
juries,
but
returned
felony
indictments
by
means
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
would
a
witness
at
a
preliminary
hearing
have
absolute
immunity?
there
is
a
judge
presiding
there.
justice
elena
kagan
to
me,
mr.
pincus,
the
oddest
thing
about
your
case
is
the
notion
of
being
able
to
sue
the
investigator
when
you
can't
sue
the
prosecutor
for
whom
he
works.
so
that
even
if
there
is
--
are
some
set
of
people
that
you
--
that
you
could
sue
for
actions
in
the
grand
jury
context,
the
notion
that
you
can
sue
an
employee
of
a
prosecutor
when
you
can't
sue
the
prosecutor
seems
an
odd
rule.
