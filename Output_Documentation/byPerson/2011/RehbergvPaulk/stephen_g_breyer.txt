justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
reason
why,
if
we
give
absolute
immunity
to
the
witness
at
a
trial,
we
give
absolute
immunity
to
the
prosecutors
and
government
officials
at
the
trial,
and
a
grand
jury
is
sort
of
like
a
trial,
at
least
it's
testimony
under
oath.
and
in
addition
there's
this
special
thing
about
grand
juries
being
secret,
which
if
you
allow
people
who
are
annoyed
and
they
would
be
quite
rightly
angry,
they
have
been
acquitted,
they
had
to
go
through
this
process,
they'd
want
to
sue
somebody.
if
we
let
them
sue,
you
will
wreck
the
secrecy
of
a
lot
of
cases.
so
i
see
a
reason
for
treating
the
grand
jury
even
more
strictly.
what's
the
reason
for
treating
it
less
strictly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
don't
accept
that.
suppose
i
say,
yes,
i
accept
that,
there's
a
relationship,
but
exactly
what
happened
in
1871
is
not
precisely
always
the
convincing
feature
for
me.
so
i
read
what
the
situation
is
today,
and
it
is
i
think
as
i
described
it.
so
given
the
situation
today,
my
question
remains.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
disagree
with
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
different
from
--
i
mean,
i
find
the
solicitor
general
--
it's
my
fault,
i'm
sure
--
i
don't
understand
the
position
they're
taking.
i
mean,
i
think
in
every
case
there
is
some
evidence
about
what
goes
on
outside
the
courtroom
or
the
grand
jury
room,
and
then
there
is
some
evidence
about
what
went
on
inside.
and
i
don't
know
when
you're
supposed
to
introduce
what.
so
i'm
guessing
that,
whatever
the
rule
is
about
when
you
can
use
what
parts
of
what,
that
if
you
win
the
rule
about
when
you
should
use
or
when
you
still
can
use
the
testimony
that's
given
in
the
grand
jury
room
is
the
same
as
the
rule
that
says
when
you
can
use
the
testimony
of
a
witness
at
trial.
see,
i
would
have
thought
that
immunity
means
you
can't
use
that
testimony,
but
i'm
told
i'm
wrong
about
that.
you
sometimes
can
use
it.
so
then
i
don't
know
when
you
can
use
it
and
when
you
can't.
maybe
you
know.
you've
studied
this
case.
i
admit
i
haven't
studied
it
as
thoroughly
as
i
hope
you
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
absolutely
immune,
i'm
thinking
of
a
typical
case
as
follows:
smith
says
to
his
friend:
i
hate
that
rat
jones.
i
am
going
to
go
and
lie
and
say
he
stole
my
horse.
next
step,
he
goes
to
the
grand
jury
or
someone
and
says:
jones
stole
my
horse.
third
step,
he's
in
the
grand
jury
room
saying:
jones
stole
my
horse.
fourth,
he's
at
trial,
okay?
so
what
comes
in
and
what
doesn't?
and
can
you
bring
a
case
in
the
first
place?
i'm
at
sea.
whatever
you
can
help
me
with,
i'd
be
happy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
always
something
else.
he
didn't
think
of
this
thing
for
the
first
time
in
the
grand
jury
room.
the
defendant
thought
of
this
thing
outside
the
grand
jury
room
before
he
even
got
to
the
grand
jury,
and
he
probably
told
somebody
about
it,
or
he
could
have,
or
at
least
there's
the
evidence
that
he
walked
to
the
grand
jury
room,
okay?
so
there
is
always
something
outside
the
grand
jury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
prosecutor
immune
--
i
know
the
prosecutor
is
not
immune
or
the
complaining
witness
is
not
when
they
get
an
arrest
warrant.
is
the
prosecutor
immune
when
he
is
taking
the
step
of
getting
an
information
or
indictment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is
immune?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
this
is
equivalent
to
doing
that.
that's
a
prosecutorial
function.
the
prosecution
would
be
immune.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
this
isn't
a
prosecutor;
this
is
a
subordinate.
the
person
here
is
the
defend--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
subordinate
government
official
involved
when
a
prosecutor
gets
an
information,
files
an
information
or
--
the
way
you
get
somebody
indicted
is
you
have
an
indictment,
which
is
the
grand
jury,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
an
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
when
you
get
the
information,
is
it
just
somebody
from
the
district
attorney's
office
or
the
prosecutor's
office,
or
is
there
somebody
else
there?
is
there
a
policeman
there
that
gives
any--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
can
be,
okay.
if
there
is,
has
he
ever
been
held
immune
or
not?
the
prosecutor
is
immune.
now
he's
there
with
an
assistant,
the
policeman
to
back
him
up.
is
there
any
law
on
that,
whether
the
policeman
is
immune?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he's
not
immune.
we
know
he's
not
that.
it's
just
he
files
the
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
states
that
have
that?
or
are
there
any
other
jurisdictions
where
they
don't
give
immunity
to
grand
jury
testimony
for
complaining
witnesses
or
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
today
are
there
a
lot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
there
any
way
to
find
out
what's
happened?
have
they
been
--
have
the
grand
juries
been
undermined?
have
they
not
been
undermined?
i
mean,
what
has
actually
happened
in
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
one
or
two
states
that
allow
these
actions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
how
long
have
they
had
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
how
long?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
have
there
been
many
such
grand
jury
acts?
