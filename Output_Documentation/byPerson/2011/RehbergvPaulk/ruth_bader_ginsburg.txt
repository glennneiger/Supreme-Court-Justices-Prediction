justice
ruth
bader

mr.
pincus,
you
said
--
i
think
you
used
the
words
"the
one
who
motivated
the
charge.
"
or
something
to
that
effect.
and
i'm
looking
at
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case
and
it
says,
and
this
is
on
page
28
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
says
mr.
hodges
--
that's
the
prosecutor
--
know
or
should
have
known
there
was
no
probable
cause.
mr.
hodges,
"directed
mr.
paulk
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
attest
to
the
truth
of
such
charges.
"
so
if
anyone
was
the
instigator,
it
was
the
prosecutor,
not
his
aide.
but
the
prosecutor
gets
absolute
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
did
it
--
if
he
did
at
the
prosecutor's
bidding,
then
he
is
not
the
prime
mover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
--
instigator,
what
you
call
the
complaining
witness,
would
have
been
--
immunity,
identical
testimony
at
the
trial
itself,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
only
--
it's
only
what
you
call
the
complaining
witness
that
gets
this
special
treatment?
all
the
other
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
would
be
absolutely
immune?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
where
do
you
locate
the
grand
jury?
we
have
on
the
one
side
you
recited
malley.
that
was
an
arrest
warrant,
testimony
in
support
of
an
arrest
warrant.
then
we
have
the
trial,
where
everybody
gets
absolute
immunity.
and
the
grand
jury
is
in
between
those
two.
so
why
should
we
bracket
it
with
the
arrest
warrant
rather
than
with
the
trial?
the
arrest
warrant
is
certainly
pre-prosecution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
agree
with
the
position
that
the
united
states
took,
which
is
you
can
--
if
there
was
evidence
outside
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
this
person
was
the
instigator,
that
that
could
be
the
basis
for
a
malicious
prosecution
1983
claim?
i
thought
the
united
states'
position
was:
we're
not
going
to
use
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
but
if
this
person
did
things
outside
the
grand
jury
to
instigate
the
prosecution
that
--
that
could--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
let's
go
back
one
stage.
let's
go
back
to
an
arrest
warrant.
the
witness
--
and
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
warrant
is
filled
with
lies.
the
affidavit
is
presented
to
a
judge,
and
i
would
think
that's
better
than
a
prosecutor.
and
yet
there
is
no
absolute
immunity
for
someone
who
lies
in
order
to
get
a
warrant,
even
though
the
judge
makes
the
judgment
whether
the
warrant
should
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
we
had,
instead
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
an
indictment,
an
accusation
to
begin
the
prosecution
and
a
supporting
affidavit
in
connection
with
the
accusation.
would
there
be
--
would
there
be
absolute
immunity
then
for
the
affidavit
that
supports
the
accusation
which
will
begin
the
prosecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
we
take
the
grand
jury
out
of
it.
we
are
going
to
begin
the
case,
the
prosecution,
by
an
information.
or
i
think
the
georgia
law
refers
to
something
called
an
accusation.
if
--
if
we
are
not
before
a
grand
jury,
and
the
prosecution
is
instituted
by
an
information,
and
there
is
an
affidavit
supporting
that
information,
is
there
absolute
immunity
for
the
false
affidavit
in
support
of
the
information?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
cited
a
provision
of
the
georgia
code
that
seems
to
equate
what's
called
an
accusation
with
an
indictment.
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
22:
"all
legal
proceedings
by
which
a
person's
liability
for
a
crime
is
determined,
commencing
with
the
return
of
the
indictment
or
the
filing
of
the
accusation.
"
so
if
the
georgia
code
equates
those
two,
the
return
of
the
indictment
or
the
filing
of
the
accusation,
why
shouldn't
the
immunity
rule
be
the
same
for
the
two?
and
you
told
me
that
malley
would
cover
the
filing
of
the
accusation.
so
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
for
the
return
of
the
indictment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
regard
the
grand
jury
as
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
judge.
and
it
seems
to
me
odd
to
say
--
there
is
no
presiding
judge,
there
is
no
cross-examination.
and
the
indictment
has
the
same
function
as
an
information.
so
why
should
it
rank
as
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
go
for
the
prosecutor,
too,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
information?
if
you
--
if
you
granted
it
was
malley,
the
--
the
prosecutor
who
lies
to
the
magistrate
is
not
going
to
have
absolute
immunity,
as
the
arrest
warrant
states.
is
the
prosecutor
absolutely
immune
for
making
out
an
information
that
is
packed
with
lies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
an
arrest
warrant
intimately
associated?
