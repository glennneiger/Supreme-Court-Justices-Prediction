mr.
john
c.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
way
the
respondent
sees
it
is
the
extension
of
briscoe
into
the
absolute
immunity
for
all
witnesses
in
the
grand
jury
with
no
distinction
with
respect
to
whether
they
are
the
complaining
witness
or
otherwise.
as
this
court
has
said
in
briscoe,
that
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
witnesses,
both
at
the
grand
jury
proceeding
and
at
trial,
and
you
want
to
preserve
every
man's
evidence
and
you
want
to
keep
the
court
from
harassing--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--if
it's
outside
of
the
grand
jury
--
and
i
go
for
the
but-for
test
like
the--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--yes,
that
person
could
be
sued
under
the
but-for
standard.
mr.
john
c.
jones
no,
that
isn't.
because--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--that
is
my
point.
mr.
john
c.
jones
that
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
other
than
the
mere
testimony.
and
if
there
is
evidence
other
than
the
mere
testimony,
indeed
you
can
go
forward
with
a
1983
claim.
mr.
john
c.
jones
the
way
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
position
was
that
if
the
only
way
that
you
could
prove
the
allegation
was
to
use
the
grand
jury
testimony,
then
indeed
you
could
not
bring
a
suit
under
1983.
but
i
think
as
justice
scalia's
question
was
proffered
is
that
it
was
an
independent
act
that
in
and
of
itself
created
a
constitutional
violation,
independent
and
actually
caused
the
prosecution.
then
indeed--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
jones
well--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--well,
that's
certainly
one
of
the
issues.
but
nothing
like
this
--
what
the
solicitor
general
is
recommending,
none
of
those
issues
were
raised
below,
none
of
those
issues
were
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--that's
correct,
it
was
waived
and
it's
--
and
it's
not
before
the
court
and
that's
not
why
cert
was
granted.
mr.
john
c.
jones
it
was
never
presented
by
any
side
at
any
--
to
any
place
in
the
court
below.
mr.
john
c.
jones
well,
certainly,
i
mean,
this
case
has
to
be
--
it's
going
back
to
the
district
court
anyway,
as
your
honor
is
well
aware.
and
perhaps
it
can
be
raised
again
at
that
time
with
an
amendment.
but
at
the
present
time
it's
not
in
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
jones
if
you
look
at
common
law,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
at
common
law,
and
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
in
his
concurrence
in
kalina,
what
you
had
is
two
separate
acts
when
you
had
a
malicious
prosecution
at
common
law.
the
first
act
was
actually
complaining
and
making
a
complaint
to,
to
get
a
warrant,
in
other
words
swearing
at
that
point
in
time.
but
there
again,
the
person
that
complained
actually
didn't
have
to
be
a
witness.
but
when
he
was
a
witness
or
when
he
or
she
became
a
witness
at
court,
that
testimony
could
then
be
used
to
show
malice
for
the
prosecution
or
for
actually
bringing
the
case.
mr.
john
c.
jones
that
is
correct,
if
indeed
it's
an
independent
cause
of
action
outside
of
the
court,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
jones
first
of
all,
to
respond,
one,
our
position
with
respect
to
the
solicitor
general
on
that
issue,
i
don't
see
it
as
any
different.
what
i
was
suggesting,
what
i
understood
justice
scalia
to
say,
is
when
you
have
something
independent
that
forms
a
cause
of
action,
for
example,
if
you
take
and
plant
evidence
in
of
a
crime,
for
example
cocaine
or
something
of
that
nature,
that
is
a
separate
and
distinct
cause
of
action
and
that
would
cause
--
that
action
by
an
investigator
might
very
well
cause
the
prosecution
or
the
district
attorney
to
act
when
indeed
you
would
have
--
they
would
find
something--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--i
hope
i
have
as
well.
at
least
as
i
understand
with
respect
to
--
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
briscoe,
everything
that's
in
briscoe,
as
you
know,
is
absolutely
immune
from
civil
damage
litigation.
mr.
john
c.
jones
first
of
all
--
and
it
might
be
a
difficult
time.
but
the
--
when
you
have
a
grand
jury,
you
have
something
different
from
just
bringing
a
cause
of
action.
what
you
have
in
a
grand
jury
is
you
have
evidence
presented
to
the
prosecutor,
typically
a
district
attorney,
and
then
the
district
attorney
makes
an
independent
evaluation
as
to
what
to
bring
to
the
grand
jury
and
who
to
indict
or
whether
to
indict
anybody
whatsoever.
that
testimony
in
that
grand
jury
--
if
you
bring
a
cause
of
action,
for
example
if
a
cause
of
action
is
brought
for
malicious
prosecution,
which
they're
trying
to
do
here,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
van
dekamp
case
is
that
the
only
time
that
you
can
use
that
testimony
is
if
there
is
something
else
outside
of
the
grand
jury--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--sure,
but
the
case
law
says
that
if
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
taken
the
case,
or
would
not
have
done
the
case
but
for
the
conduct
for
the
individual,
then
indeed
you
cannot
bring
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
c.
jones
it
does
exist,
because
typically
when
you
have
an
investigation
in
any
type
of
district
attorney's
office,
what
you
have
is
investigators
going
out
and
investigating
a
case,
bringing
the
material
to
the
district
attorney,
then
the
district
attorney
looks
at
the
material,
and
then
the
district
attorney
is
the
one
that
makes
an
independent
decision.
mr.
john
c.
jones
the
distinction
in
malley
is
--
is
this:
first
of
all,
the
--
in
malley
and
when
you
go
apply
for
a
warrant,
the
--
at
that
point
in
time
the
investigator
is,
he
is
determining
--
he
or
she
is
determining
the
time,
place,
and
manner
in
which
to
go
to
the
judge
and
also
possibly
he
can,
he
or
she
can
select
the
judge
that
the
person
wants
to
go
for.
and
then
what
has
happened
is
that
person
who
presents
that
evidence
is
presenting
the
evidence
that
he
or
she
has
gathered
and
is
going
to
present
it
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
investigation.
that
person
won't
necessarily
present
the
bad
part.
they
might
present
just
only
the,
exclusively
the
good
part.
and
also,
that
person
isn't
under
the
subpoena
power.
mr.
john
c.
jones
if
i
understand
your
question,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
heard
it
exactly,
are
you
saying
if
there's
an
affidavit
that
went
before
the
grand
jury?
mr.
john
c.
jones
once
again,
that's
a
scenario
essentially
in
malley
and
kalina,
where
you
had
those
individuals
coming
before.
they
were
not
subpoenaed.
those
individuals
--
whether
it's
affidavit
or
testimony,
i
think
either
one
is
testimony.
mr.
john
c.
jones
and
--
and
i'm
not
positive
i
understand
the
question,
but
as
i
understand
it
what
you
have
in
a
malley
situation
is
again
you
have
somebody
that
is
merely
coming
before
the
judge
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
warrant
to
issue.
that
person
doesn't
--
isn't
under
the
constraint
of
a
prosecutor,
an
independent
prosecutor
in
the
meantime
--
actually,
the
person
asking
the
questions,
asking
--
and
actually
subpoenaing
a
witness,
like
a
grand
jury.
that
person
is
actually
--
and
what
the
court
has
said
is
potentially
wasting
judicial
resources
by
bringing
a
not-so-good
case,
just
like
in
malley,
to
the
court.
and
so
to
protect
the
court
and
to
protect
the
judicial
process,
the
court
has
said
that
person
only
has
qualified
immunity
so
as
to
make
him
think
and
make
the
process
think
before
it
happens,
before
they
go
to
the
judge.
but
in
the
grand
jury
scenario
you
have
an
independent
individual,
in
this
case
the
prosecutor,
receiving
the
evidence
and
the
prosecutor
deciding
what
cases
to
bring.
mr.
john
c.
jones
it
is
the
position
that
it
can
be,
and
--
and
i
hate
to
say
--
equivocate
there.
but
i
will
state
this:
if
indeed
that
district
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
in
a
case
would
not
have
proceeded
but
for
that
testimony
or
that
statements
before
him,
in
other
words,
he
would
not
have
done
anything
there,
like,
as
i
stated
earlier,
like
the
planting
of
the
cocaine
or
the
finding
of
the
cocaine--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--under
that
scenario,
no.
because
the
only
way
that
that
act
can
be
proven,
the
only
way
that
the
malicious
prosecution
claim
can
be
proven,
would
be
to
get
the
grand
jury
testimony
before
--
to
actually
utilize
that
grand
jury
testimony,
and
that
testimony
is
absolutely
protected
under
briscoe.
mr.
john
c.
jones
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
c.
jones
i
mean,
do
you
need
a
witness
to
come
and
testify
as
to
whether
they
had
a
communication?
mr.
john
c.
jones
it
--
it
would
appear
that
that
would
certainly
be
an
element
that
you
would
have
to
establish.
now,
whether
you
would
need
a
witness
or
you
can
get
one
of
those
two
to
testify
is
another
issue.
mr.
john
c.
jones
yes,
i
do.
and
this
court
has
so
stated,
not
only
in
--
well,
the
court
has
stated
first
of
all
in
burns
v.
reed;
it
talks
about
how
you
have
prosecutorial
immunity.
and
in
malley,
it
also
states
it's
the
first
stage
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
john
c.
jones
well,
it
has
many
more
of
the
trappings
of
a
trial
than,
say,
coming
before
a
judge
like
in
the
malley
scenario.
first
of
all,
you're
subject
to
compulsory
process.
the
person
is
placed
under
oath.
the
person
may
indeed
not
even
want
to
come
and
testify.
i
think
that
was
earlier
mentioned
by
justice
scalia.
the
person
might
not
even
want
to
be
there,
and
yet
he's
subpoenaed
and
he's
forced
to
be
there.
the
--
also
in
that
situation,
the
district
attorney,
he
or
she,
is
the
one
that's
controlling
the
evidence,
the
one
who's
controlling
what
is
before
the
court,
and
that
person
is
also
determining
which
person
is
going
to
be
indicted
and
the
evidence
to
be
presented.
so
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
as
i
see
it
significant.
and
one,
the
grand
jury
is
much
more
akin
to
a
judicial
proceeding
and
a
trial
than
the
scenario
you
have
in
malley.
mr.
john
c.
jones
yes.
mr.
john
c.
jones
yes.
mr.
john
c.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
jones
no,
the
person
here
is
the
investigator
who
is
employed
by
the
prosecutor.
and
i
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
prosecutor
himself
in
this
situation
directed
the
investigator
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
and
directed
him
as
to
what
to
testify
to
at
the
grand
jury.
so
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
the
--
who
is
absolutely
immune,
in
the
grand
jury
setting
the
prosecutor
is
immune,
the
grand
jurors
are
immune.
in
trial,
the
prosecutor
is
also
immune,
any
of
the
witnesses
testifying
is
immune.
it
makes
logical
sense
that
anybody
that
comes
before
the
grand
jury
is
likewise
immune.
mr.
john
c.
jones
right.
mr.
john
c.
jones
right.
mr.
john
c.
jones
there
can
be.
mr.
john
c.
jones
just
if
he's
asking
for
an
arrest
warrant;
is
that
what--
mr.
john
c.
jones
--he
files
the
information
and
it's
not
in
a
grand
jury
setting.
mr.
john
c.
jones
then
indeed,
i
would
suggest
it's
very
similar
to
the
malley
scenario,
where
he
would
have
qualified
immunity.
mr.
john
c.
jones
no.
mr.
john
c.
jones
yes.
because
that
is
--
that
is
what
this
court
has
decided
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process.
and
any
of
the
conduct
that
is
intimately
associated
under
imbler,
under
kalina,
under
various
things,
burns
v.
reed
are
intimately
--
anything
that
is
intimately
associated
is
absolutely
immune.
mr.
john
c.
jones
well,
an
arrest
warrant
in
the
--
like
in
the
kalina
and
malley
situation,
you
didn't
have
a
prosecutor
going
before
them.
that
was
an
independent
action
by
an
investigator
who
went
before
a
judge
to
seek
a
warrant
and
present
any
evidence
that
that
person
had.
mr.
john
c.
jones
because
--
just
because
they
allegedly
conspired
together
to
do
this
doesn't
mean
the
act
was
completed
until
after,
in
this
case,
mr.
hodges
and
it
was
actually
kelly
burke,
actually
performed
what
they
did.
now
--
and
it
--
and
if
the
prosecutor
knows
about
it
at
that
point,
and
they
allegedly
conspire,
now
who
is
taking
the
act?
it
really
is
not
any
more
mr.
paulk;
it
is
the
district
attorney
who
is
acting
at
that
point,
and
it
is
the
district
attorney
that
is
now
proceeding
in
the
grand
jury.
and
as
--
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
if
anything,
that's
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase,
and
he's
absolutely
immune
for
his
conduct.
but
even,
just
because
the
district
attorney
knows
about
it
and
so
does
the
investigator
know
about
it,
it
is
the
conduct
and
the
independent
act
now
of
the
prosecutor
to
get
the
indictment.
mr.
john
c.
jones
no.
and
perhaps
that's
not
my
position.
first
of
all,
i'm
not
saying
that
they're
--
what
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
bringing
a
malicious
prosecution
claim
is
that,
i
think
justice
scalia
asked
me
if
there
is
a
completely
independent
act,
but
if
--
in
the
scenario
that
you
paint,
just
the
fact
that
they've
talked
outside
the
grand
jury,
that
does
not
authorize
an
independent
cause
of
action
for
a
malicious
prosecution
claim.
what
you
have
to
have
is
an
independent
act,
just
like
what
you
had
at
common
law
where
you
had
two
distinct
acts:
one,
where
you
actually
filed
the
complaint;
now
you
become
the
complainant
or
as
the
common
law
said
you
became
the
complaining
witness
even
if
you
didn't
have
to
be
a
witness.
but
then
if
you
were
a
witness,
indeed,
that
testimony
that
you
gave
in
the
--
in
the
grand
jury
or
in
the
trial
could
be
used
as
to
--
to
prove
your
malicious
intent
in
bringing
the
charge
initially.
and
that
--
that
doesn't
equate
to
what
we
have
here
in
this
--
in
this
scenario.
what
we
have
here
is
there
may
have
been
a
discussion
outside
of
the
court
or
outside
of
the
grand
jury,
but
that
discussion
now
ended
and
now
you
have
an
independent
act
by
the
prosecutor
to
bring
the
cause
of
action.
so
it's
a
completely
distinct,
as
i
see
it,
completely
distinct
scenarios.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
