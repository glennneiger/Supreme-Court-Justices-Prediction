justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
problem
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that
i
don't
really
know
what
a
complaining
witness
is
in
the
grand
jury
context.
let's
take
the
federal
grand
jury
as
an
example.
do
you
think
there
are
complaining
witnesses
before
federal
grand
juries?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
complaining
witness
i
would
think
is
a
person
who
files
a
complaint,
who
causes
--
in
the
federal
system
it
would
be
someone
who
files
a
complaint
and
attests
to
it
under
rule
5.
that
person
is
asking
that
charges
be
brought.
that's
what
it
means
to
be
a
complaining
witness,
filing
a
complaint.
nobody
--
no
witness
before
a
federal
grand
jury
asks
that
an
indictment
be
returned.
they
provide
testimony,
and
they
may
want
an
indictment
to
be
returned,
but
it's
the
prosecutor
who
asks
for
the
indictment
to
be
returned.
so
i
don't
see
how
there
is
a
complaining
witness
in
that
sense
in
the
traditional
grand
jury
context.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
another
example
that
i
think
happens
with
some
frequency.
you
have
a
federal
grand
jury
and
you
have
testimony
by
an
fbi
or
a
dea
case
agent,
a
person
who's
been
working
on
the
case,
and
that
witness
provides
a
lot
of
information
supporting
the
charges
that
the
prosecutor
wants
returned.
you
also
have
a
cooperating
witness,
someone
who
has
entered
into
a
plea
bargain
and
in
exchange
for
that
is
providing
a
lot
of
incriminating
testimony.
now,
is
there
a
complaining
witness
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
one
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
both?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
holding
--
the
holding
that
you
are
asking
for
isn't
going
to
do
very
much
good
if
the
--
if
the
mere
issuance
of
the
grand
jury
subpoena
renders
the
person
not
a
complaining
witness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
that
situation,
then
why
not
subpoena
everybody?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
said
that
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
in
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
make
somebody
not
a
complaining
witness.
so
if
you
are
issued
a
subpoena
you
still
might
be
a
complaining
witness
if
you
really
didn't
need
to
get
a
subpoena.
if
you
could
have
been
persuaded
to
go
without
a
subpoena,
then
maybe
you
could
be
a
complaining
witness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
somebody--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--at
common
law
did
any
grand
jury
witnesses
have
absolute
immunity
from
a
claim
for
malicious
prosecution?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
could
there
be
malicious
prosecution
liability
for
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
who
was
not
a
"complaining
witness".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
are
not
really
asking
us
to
adopt
the
common
law
rule,
are
you?
you
are
asking
for
a
variation
of
the
common
law
rule
that
is
limited
to
complaining
witnesses.
or
are
you
going
further.
are
you
saying
that
no
witness
before
a
grand
jury
should
have
absolute
immunity
from
a
so-called
1983
malicious
prosecution
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
i
understand
your
answer,
that
you're
not
--
that
this
whole
business
about
complaining
witness
is
irrelevant.
any
--
no
witness
before
a
grand
jury
gets
absolute
immunity.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
complaining
witness
could
--
who
would
satisfy
the
elements
of
the
malicious
prosecution
tort
could
be
liable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
that's
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
the
same
--
i
have
the
same
concern
as
justice
breyer.
let
me
try
to
ask
the
question
in
a
different
way.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
someone
would
qualify
as
a
complaining
witness
under
mr.
pincus's
definition
and
yet
would
not
have
done
something
outside
of
the
grand
jury
that
would
be
sufficient
to
make
out
a
claim
of
malicious
prosecution?
if
that
situation
doesn't
exist,
then
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
your
position
and
mr.
pincus's
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
paragraph
29
of
the
complaint
alleges
mr.
paulk
and
mr.
hodges,
acting
under
color
of
law,
in
retaliation
and
wrongfully
influenced
and
instigated
the
prosecutorial
decision
to
bring
charges
against
mr.
rehberg.
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
support
a
claim
of
so-called
malicious
prosecution
without
regard
to
the
evidentiary
--
or
without
regard
to
the
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
those
--
are
those
cases
involving
grand
jury
proceedings
like
the
one
here
which
does
look
somewhat
like
the
complaint
situation?
or
are
they
more
traditional
grand
jury
settings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
witness,
who
testifies
before
a
grand
jury,
is
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
from
suit
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
as
a
witness
who
testifies
at
trial.
petitioner
charles
rehberg,
a
certified
public
accountant
sent
anonymous
faxes
to
several
recipients,
including
the
management
of
a
hospital
in
albany,
georgia,
criticizing
the
hospital's
management
and
activities.
in
response,
the
local
district
attorney's
office,
with
the
assistance
of
its
chief
investigator,
respondent
james
paulk,
launched
a
criminal
investigation
of
rehberg,
allegedly
as
a
favor
to
the
hospital's
leadership.
paulk
testified
three
times
before
a
grand
jury
and
rehberg
was
indicted
three
times.
among
other
things
he
was
charged
with
assault
and
making
harassing
phone
calls.
the
indictments
were
all
dismissed.
petitioner
then
brought
this
action
under
section
1983,
alleging
that
respondent
had
conspired
to
present
and
did
present
false
testimony
to
the
grand
jury.
respondent
moved
to
dismiss,
arguing
among
other
things
that
he
was
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
for
his
grand
jury
testimony.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion
to
dismiss,
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
petitioner's
allegation
that
respondent
was
the
sole
complaining
witness
before
the
grand
jury,
but
it
declined
to
recognize
a
complaining
witness
exception
to
its
precedent
on
grand
jury
witness
immunity
and
it
held
that
respondent
was
absolutely
immune
from
a
section
1983
claim
based
on
his
grand
jury
testimony.
we
agree
and
hold
that
a
grand
jury
witness
is
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
from
suit
under
section
1983
as
a
witness
who
testifies
at
trial.
in
briscoe
versus
lahue,
the
court
held
that
a
trial
witness,
sued
under
section
1983,
has
absolute
immunity
with
respect
to
any
claim
based
on
his
testimony
because
without
such
immunity
the
truth-seeking
process
would
be
impaired
as
witnesses
might
be
reluctant
to
testify,
and
even
a
witness
who
took
the
stand
might
be
inclined
to
shade
his
testimony
in
favor
of
the
potential
plaintiff
for
fear
of
subsequent
civil
liability.
these
factors
apply
with
equal
force
to
grand
jury
witnesses.
in
both
contexts,
a
witness'
fear
of
retaliatory
litigation
may
deprive
the
tribunal
of
critical
evidence
and
in
either
context
is
the
deterrent
of
potential
civil
liability
needed
to
prevent
perjurious
testimony
because
perjury
before
a
grand
jury
like
the
perjury
at
trial
is
a
serious
criminal
offense.
petitioner's
main
argument
is
that
under
our
cases,
certain
grand
jury
witnesses,
namely
those
who
qualified
as
complaining
witnesses,
are
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
but
this
court
looks
to
the
common
law
for
guidance
in
identifying
the
functions
meriting
the
protection
of
absolute
immunity.
and
at
the
time
when
section
1983's
predecessor
was
enacted
as
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
a
complaining
witness
was
a
party
who
procured
an
arrest
and
initiated
a
criminal
prosecution.
a
complaining
witness
might
testify
either
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
trial,
but
testifying
was
not
a
necessary
characteristic
of
a
complaining
witness.
in
sum,
testifying
whether
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
trial
was
not
a
distinctive
function
performed
by
a
complaining
witness.
it
is
clear
that
a
complaining
witness
cannot
be
held
liable
for
perjurious
testimony
at
trial
and
there
is
no
more
reason
why
a
complaining
witness
should
be
subject
to
liability
for
testimony
before
a
grand
jury.
for
these
and
other
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
