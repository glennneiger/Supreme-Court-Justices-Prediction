what
if
an
important
witness
is
reluctant
to
testify,
but
is
issued
a
subpoena
by
the
united
states
attorney
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
and
then
with
reluctance
he
comes
forward,
but
under
oath
provides
all
of
the
key
testimony
necessary
to
indict.
is
he
a
complaining
witness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
test
we
are
supposed
to
use
to
decide?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave,
what's
the
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
agree
that
we
should
vacate
and
remand
according
to
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
why
is
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
just
because
of
your
view
of
the
evidence,
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
justify
the
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
this
was
waived
is
just
not
in
the
case?
because
usually
if
the
issue
wasn't
discussed
that's
the
reason
we
remand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
--
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
a
theory
of
liability
and
we
find
that
there
is
--
that
that
theory
is
baseless,
we
don't
generally
dismiss
the
complaint
if
there
are
other
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
could
support
liability
on
another
theory.
