mr.
pincus,
you
in
answer
to
one
of
justice
kagan's
questions,
you
noted
that
you
really
can't
find
a
case
where
a
court
relied
exclusively
on
the
grand
jury
testimony.
in
most
of
the
cases
that
i've
reviewed,
there's
a
discussion
that
both
non-grand
jury
and
grand
jury
testimony
was
being
relied
upon;
is
that
accurate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
--
the
united
states
as
amica
is
supporting
a
vacatur
and
remand
on
the
ground
that
there
might
be
adequate
independent
evidence
from
the
grand
jury
testimony
in
this
case
to
sustain
a
cause
of
action.
do
you
agree
with
their
recommendation?
and
if
you
don't
agree,
assume
that
we
were
to
adopt
the
united
states'
position.
what
would
be
the
independent
evidence
that
you
have
that
would
support
a
malicious
prosecution
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
the
court
below
took
that
into
account
and
said:
you
are
only
relying
on
the
grand
jury
testimony
to
prove
the
conspiracy
and
that's
not
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
what
an
independent
cause
of
action
could
be,
because
it
is
the
grand
jury
proceeding
that
initiates
the
action.
so,
why
would
the
common
law
permit
it
unless
it
recognized
that
a
complaining
witness
has
to
do
something
to
get
the
grand
jury
up
and
running,
and
go
in
and
testify
to
something
false
to
be
liable
for
malicious
prosecution.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is,
i
don't
see
how
your
position
differs
from
the
government's
at
all,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
--
how
you
could
have
independent
guilt
proven
that
requires
anything
more
than
proof,
than
the
proof
they
proffered
below,
which
was
that
this
police
officer
issued
subpoenas
and
took
other
steps
to
start
the
grand
jury's
process.
and
then
you
use
their
testimony
at
the
grand
jury
to
figure
out
whether
it
was
fault
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
explain
to
me
again
--
over
here,
mr.
jones.
explain
to
me
again
why
the
act
of
sitting
down
with
the
prosecutor
in
his
office
and
telling
him
a
falsehood
that
leads
the
prosecutor
to
convene
the
grand
jury
and
call
you
as
a
witness,
why
that
act
of
meeting
with
the
prosecutor
and
stating
the
false
statement
is
not
actionable
independently?
or
is
it
your
position
that
that
would
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no,
no.
he
sat
down,
told
the
prosecutor
exactly
what
he
was
later
going
to
say
in
the
grand
jury.
i
rarely
called
a
witness
to
a
grand
jury
when
i
was
a
prosecutor
who
i
hadn't
spoken
to
before.
occasionally
i
had
to
because
of
circumstances,
but
the
vast
majority
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
and
find
out
what
their
story
is.
identical
story
before
and
after
during
the
grand
jury.
is
the
story
before
an
independent
act
sufficient
to
bring
a
malicious
prosecution
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
a
time
sheet
that
shows
that
the
prosecutor
met
with--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
investigator?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
a
time
sheet.
you
mean,
you
need
a
witness
to
say
they
met
together?
you
need
someone
to
say
that
they
talked
before
the
grand
jury?
assuming
you
have
that
much
evidence,
you
think
that's
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
exactly.
is
that
what
you
are
requiring?
