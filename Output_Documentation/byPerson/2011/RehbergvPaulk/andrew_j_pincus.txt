mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
twice
held,
in
malley
and
in
kalina,
that
a
complaining
witness
who
sets
a
criminal
prosecution
in
motion
by
submitting
a
false
affidavit
is
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
but
not
absolute
immunity,
in
an
action
under
section
1983.
the
court
rested
that
conclusion
on
its
determination
that
complaining
witnesses
were
subject
to
damages
liability
at
common
law
when
--
in
1871
when
section
1983
was
enacted.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
rule
of
malley
and
kalina
also
applies
to
a
complaining
witness
who
sets
a
prosecution
in
motion
by
testifying
before
a
grand
jury.
again,
the
common
law
provides
the
answer.
the
law
is
clear
that
in
1871
damages
liability
could
be
based
on
false
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
there
--
there
can
be.
it
depends
obviously
on
the
--
the
circumstances,
your
honor,
but
--
but
there
certainly
can
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
the
common
law
confronted
precisely
the
same
situation,
and
after
public
prosecutors
came
into
being
and
when
grand
juries
were
empaneled
by
them,
the
common
law
concluded
that,
both
in
1871
and
in
the
present,
that
there
can
be
a
person
who
is
the
motivating
force
behind
the
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
at
--
at
common
law
the
complaining
witness
was
more
than
just
someone
who
gave
evidence
that
was
necessary
for
the
warrant
or
the
indictment
to
issue.
it
was
someone
who
was
pushing
for
the
prosecution
to
be
brought.
all
of
these
problems,
of
course,
occurred
at
common
law
and
they
also
occur
in
connection
with
the
circumstances
that
the
court
addressed
in
malley
and
kalina.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
again,
your
honor,
there
can
be.
it
depends
--
it--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
could
be
both.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
could
be
one
or
--
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
one
or
the
other.
i
think
these
--
these
circumstances
again
are
not
unknown
to
the
common
law
in
the
states.
they--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
know,
because
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
mr.
paulk
knew
that
his
testimony
was
false
and
--
and
made
it
--
and
gave
his
testimony
anyway.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
--
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
they
were
conspiring
together
to
bring
this
complaint.
and
so
again,
i
think
the
facts
will
be
developed.
the
--
the
first
indictment
in
fact
listed
mr.
paulk
as
the
complainant.
so
in
many
situations
the
concerns
that
justice
alito
was
pointing
to
won't
be
present
because
there
will
be
a
clear
complainant,
as
there
was
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
some
lower
courts
have
said
no,
your
honor.
some
lower
courts
have
said--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
--
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
forth
is
whether
the
complaining
witness
is
someone
who
sets
the
prosecution
in
motion.
that's
--
that's
the
phrase
that
this
court
has
used
and
that's
the
phrase
that's
--
that
is
reflected
in
the
common
law,
based
on
the
common
law.
and
the
lower
courts
have
not
had
a
problem
applying
that
case.
there
are
seven
circuits
that
now
have
adopted
the
rule
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
would
say
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
your
honor,
that
that
person
is
not
a
complaining
witness,
because
he
did
nothing
other
than
come
forward
when
he
was
subpoenaed.
if
someone
comes
forward
to
the
prosecutor,
urges
an
indictment,
urges
a
prosecution
and
then
subsequently
is
subpoenaed,
that
might
be
a
different
case
because
you
have--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
--
that
person
may
be
a
complaining
witness.
you
know,
at
common
law
the
complaining
witness
also
has
to
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--then
--
then
that
fact
would
obviously
mitigate
against
her
being
a
complaining
witness.
but
--
but
these--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
she
would
not
be--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
she
would
not
be
a
complaining
witness,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
i
--
just
to
step
back--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
don't
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
don't
think
the
mere
issuance
of
the
subpoena
does
negate
things
that
might
--
take
the
hypothetical
where
there
is
someone
who
goes
to
the
prosecutor,
says
there
should
be
a
prosecution
here,
maybe
does
the
things
that
the
hospital
is
alleged
to
have
done
in
this
case,
and
then
subsequently
is
subpoenaed.
i
don't
think
the
subpoena
negates
that
prior
activity.
i
don't
think
you
can
say,
oh,
now
that
you
are
subpoenaed
we
wipe
away
everything
that
you
have
done
to
set
the
prosecution
in
motion.
but
i
think
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
propounded,
where
there
--
the
sole
fact
is
someone
doesn't
do
anything,
they
are
subpoenaed
to
come
before
the
grand
jury
and
they
give
their
evidence,
that
wouldn't
meet
the
test.
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
there
can
be,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
what
this
court
has
indicated
in
other
cases
is
that
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
ultimately
decides
to
seek
the
charge
does
not
negate
what's
happened
before.
in
the
hartman
case,
which
dealt
with
a
retaliatory
prosecution
under
--
a
first
amendment
retaliation
prosecution,
the
court
said
the
postal
inspectors,
who
in
that
case
were
alleged
to
have
been
the
motivating
force
behind
the
retaliatory
prosecution,
could
be
held
liable
if
there
also
was
no
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
prosecutor
can't
be
a
complaining
witness
because
the
complaining
witness
is
the
person
who
provides
the
impetus.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
of
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--at
common
law--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--and
at
common
law
that
person
could
be
--
could
be
liable
for
malicious
prosecution
because--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
person
who
in
testimony
--
a
complaining
witness,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
--
in
your
opinion
in
kalina,
a
complaining
witness
does
not
have
to
actually
participate
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
to
be
a
complaining
witness
at
common
law,
you
could
be
a
person
who
outside
the
judicial
process
pushed
forward
and
was
the
mover
behind
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--can
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
tort
law
--
i
mean--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
is
writing
on
a
blank
slate
here.
tort
law
has
addressed
these
issues.
there
has
been
a
malicious
prosecution
tort
for
hundreds
of
years.
there
certainly
was
in
1871,
and
tort
law
has
dealt
and
continues
to
deal
with
the
questions
of
causation
and
proximate
cause
and
all
of
the
questions
that
arise
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
so
it's
not
as
if
the
court
here
would
be
writing
on
a
blank
slate.
and
i
think
the
critical
thing
is,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
absolute
immunity
rule
in
1871
for
persons
in
the
situation
of
the
respondent.
that
is
the
critical
question
that
the
court
has
framed.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
trial
--
because
--
because
--
well,
the
trial
testimony
could
not
be
the
basis
for
finding
the
person
a
complaining
witness
because
by
that
point
the
prosecution
has
gotten
rolling.
but
the
question
is
what
conduct
can
be
used
to
prove
that
this
is
the
person
who
was
the
instigator,
the
prime
mover
behind
the
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
common
law
rule
was
and
that's
what
congress
confronted
when
it
enacted
section
1983
in
1871.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
it
could
be
the
testimony
alone.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
think
what
i
meant
to
say,
maybe
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question,
was
the
fact
that
testimony
is
under
subpoena
doesn't
negate
other
evidence
that's
there.
but
the
testimony
alone
can
be
enough,
and
there
certainly
are
cases,
common
law
cases
from
the
1800's,
in
which
courts
rely
on
testimony.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
cases
are
--
the
case
are
a
little
bit
obscure,
your
honor,
about
what
the
facts
are
that
they
are
relying
on.
so
i
don't
want
to
say
that
absolutely
positively
there
is
one--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
logic.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
but
there
could
be
--
there
could
be
other
evidence
as
well.
i
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
same--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
the
same
risk
that
the
affiants
bore
in
kalina
and
malley
and
it's
the
same
risk
that
the
common
law
imposes
on
complaining
witnesses.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
your
honor,
maybe
i
confused
the
hypotheticals.
i
think
we
have
one
situation
where
there's
someone,
all
they've
done
is
they've
been
subpoenaed
and
they've
come
forward
and
they've
given
their
evidence.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it
would
be
very
hard
for
that
person
to
be
labeled
a
complaining
witness.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
impossible.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it
would
be
impossible,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
that
that
person--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--compelled
testimony
alone.
a
person
who
testifies
voluntarily
before
the
grand
jury
i
think
is
a
different
situation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
i
think
i
was
responding
to
a
third,
a
third
situation.
so
we
have
one
situation
where
all
someone
does
is
testify
under
subpoena.
we
have
another
situation
where
someone
testifies,
that
person
not
a
complaining
witness,
someone
who
testifies
voluntarily;
that
voluntary
testimony
certainly
could
be
used
as
evidence.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
then
the
third
situation
--
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
was
just
--
the
third
situation
is
where
there
is
pre-testimony
evidence
and
there
is
also
the
fact
that
that
person
testified
under
subpoena.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
that
person
testified
under
subpoena
negates
the
fact
that
there
is
other
evidence
that
that
person
may
have
been
the
person
who
pushed
the
prosecution
forward.
so
that's
the
distinction
that
i
was
trying
to
draw.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
reason
is
that
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
immunity
decisions
are
based
on
the
common
law
as--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
one
--
one
brief
disagreement
with
your
question,
your
honor.
i
think
the
situation
today
at
common
law
is
what
it
was.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
answer
is
several-fold.
the
court
has
given
absolute
immunity
to
witnesses
in
briscoe.
the
policy
reason
--
the
principal
reason
was
the
common
law
rule.
the
policy
reasons
that
the
court
gave
were:
a,
we
don't
want
to
deter
people
from
coming
forward;
and,
b,
the
testimony
will
be
put
through
the
adversary
process
and
it's
public,
and
those
are
protections
against
false
testimony.
in
the
--
in
the
grand
jury
situation
those
protections
are
not
present,
neither
transparency
nor
an
adversary
process.
and
what
the
court
said
in
malley
about
people
coming
forward
i
think
applies
in
the
grand
jury
context
as
well
for
complaining
witnesses.
the
court
in
malley
said
we
want
people
who
are
setting
the
prosecution
in
motion,
the
special
category
of
complaining
witnesses,
we
want
them
to
think
twice.
that's
not
a
bad
thing
when
they
are
the
motivating
force
behind
the
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
--
i
think
--
well,
we
talk
about
them,
i
think,
because
of
the
reality
that
there
are
cases
and
the
common
law
recognized
that
there
were
cases
where
the
reason
the
prosecution
got
rolling
was
because
either
a
private
person
or
a
government
person
was
the
person
who
was
pushing
it
along.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it's
true
that
the
grand
jury
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
grand
jury's
decision
is
a
step
in
the
chain,
but
the
court
has
not
said
that,
for
example,
the
judge's
decision
in
kalina
and
malley
to
issue
the
warrant
broke
the
causal
link
between
the
false
testimony
in
the
affidavits
in
those
case.
even
though
the
judge
was
making
an
independent
decision,
the
court
recognized,
as
the
common
law
recognized,
that
there
could
be
a
causal
chain
back
to
the
false
testimony
which
essentially
tainted
the
decisionmaker,
the
judge's
decision,
just
as
it
taints
the
grand
jury's
decision.
and
in
fact,
what
lower
courts
have
said
is
that
it
is
only
when
there
is
an
allegation
of
false
testimony
or
other
impropriety
in
the
grand
jury
that
looking
back
is
possible,
but
of
course
that's
the
very
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
first
reason,
your
and
honor,
is
because
that's
what
the
common
law
did.
what
the
court
--
the
court's
inquiry
here
is
to
look
at
the
common
law
and
decide
what
congress
when
it
enacted
the
statute
in
1871
confronted.
and
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
1871,
there
were
--
the
rule
was
that
complaining
witnesses
who
testified
before
grand
jury
--
that
grand
jury
testimony
of
people
who
were
complaining
witnesses
was
not
immunized
as
a
basis
for
malicious
prosecution
liability.
what
the
respondent
is
seeking
here
is
to
say:
my
grand
jury
testimony
is
immunized
as
a
basis
of
section
1983
liability,
but
at
common
law
that
simply
wasn't
the
rule.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
common
law
--
at
common
law
--
at
common
law
it
wasn't
a
question
of
immunity.
there
was
no
defamation
liability
for
any
witness.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
only
liability
was
for
malicious
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
and
that's
the
source
of
the
distinction
that
the
court
drew
in
malley
and
kalina.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
we're
not.
we
are
asking
for
exactly
the
rule
that
was
at
common
law.
what
the
court
has
said
in
kalina
and
malley
is
--
the
rule
that
the
court
adopted
there
was
based
on
precisely
the
same
distinction
that
we
rely
on
here.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor,
it's
complaining
witnesses.
the
distinction
that
the
common
law
drew
--
all
witnesses
were
immune
from
defamation.
only
--
the
only
people
who
could
be
subject
to
liability
based
on
their
testimony
were
people
who
qualified
as
complaining
witnesses.
that
is
why
the
court
in
malley
and
kalina
drew
the
line
it
did.
it
said,
these
people,
you
were
acting
as
a
complaining
witness.
the
function
you
are
performing
by
submitting
this
affidavit
is
being
a
complaining
witness.
at
common
law,
that
function
--
true,
it
wasn't
technically
immune,
but
it
was
subject
to
liability.
liability
could
be
premised
on
those
statements.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
what
the
court
has
said,
it
said
in
malley
and
kalina,
and
what
we're
relying
on
here,
is
that
those
--
those
people
also
--
congress
would
have
recognized
in
1871
that
there
could
be
liability
for
people
who
fell
into
this
category
--
and
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
it's
awfully
hard
to
tell,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
represent
there's
one.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
there
--
there
is
independent
evidence
in
this
case,
your
honor
of
--
before
the
respondent
testified
before
the
grand
jury
there
were
--
there
are
allegations
that
he
conspired
with
the
district
attorney
and
others
to
fabricate
the
--
the
evidence
that
he
gave.
and
that
obviously--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said
was
because
this
was
all
directed
to
the
grand
jury
testimony,
we're
not
going
to
separate,
uphold
--
hold
that
there
could
be
liability
based
on
that
alone.
i
think
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
our
principal
submission,
of
course,
is
there
can
be
liability
premised
on
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
common
law
for
a
different
rule.
and
our
second
position
would
be,
even
if
you,
the
court,
thought
that
grand
jury
testimony
for
some
reason
was
off
limits
but
became
permissible
as
a
basis
for
finding
liability
if
there
were
other
evidence,
then
that's
true
in
this
case
as
well.
i
want
to
return
to
justice
breyer's
question
for
1
minute,
because
there
was
the
third
policy
reason
that
i
wanted
to
provide,
which
is,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
in
the
states
many
prosecutors
can
proceed
by
information
or
indictment,
and
that
we
think
it
would
be
a
peculiar
situation
if
liability
could
be
premised
when
a
proceeding
is
initiated
by
information,
which
malley
and
kalina
make
clear,
but
that
if
the
proceeding
is
by
grand
jury
it
would
be
wholly
off
limits.
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
and
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
common
law
rule.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
the
--
the
question
about
whether
there
--
it's
an
appropriate
rule
that
a
finding
of
complaining
witness
can
be
based
on
evidence
outside
of
the
grand
jury,
but
it
can't
be
based
on
grand
jury
testimony,
that
certainly
wasn't
the
common
law
rule.
and
i
note
justice
sotomayor
asked
whether
there
were
any
common
law
cases
that
relied
solely
on
grand
jury
testimony.
and
although
the
cases
are
hard
to
parse,
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
anderson
and
the
moulton
cases
that
we
cite
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief.
in
those
cases,
in
the
anderson
case
the
court
is
talking
about
the
charge
to
the
jury,
and
what
it
says
the
evidence
was
is
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
listed
as
the
complainant
on
the
indictment
and
that
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
then
in
the
moulton
case
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
set
forth
in
the
reporting
of
the
case,
and
the
only
allegations
are
--
relate
to
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
so
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
find
any
basis
in
the
common
law
which
as
the
court
said
--
has
said
is
the
controlling
principle
here
for
ruling
the
grand
jury
testimony
either
entirely
out
of
bounds
as
a
basis
for
liability,
or
for
saying
it's
only
in
bounds
if
there
is
some
other
extrinsic
evidence.
there
is
just
no
support
for
that
in
the
common
law,
and
i
think
it
doesn't
really
make
sense
--
if
this
case
had
proceeded
by
information,
and
mr.
paulk's
grand
jury
testimony
had
simply
been
placed
in
an
affidavit
and
submitted
in
order
to
obtain
the
arrest
warrant,
malley
and
kalina
would
control
and
it
would
be
clear
that
there
would
be
liability--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--a
--
a
complaining
witness,
i
don't
think
--
if
that
is
the
proceeding
that
sets
the
prospect,
determines
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
a
prosecution,
i
think
an
ordinary
witness
would
be
absolutely
immune
but
a
complaining
witness
would
not
be.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
there
are.
there
are,
there
are
both
at
the
common
law
and
today,
your
honor;
there
are--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--there
are
--
i
don't
know
the
number.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
can
--
i
can't
give
you
an
example
of
states.
i
can
give
you
the
example
of
seven
circuits
that
--
that
have
adopted
the
rule
that
we
contend
for.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
for
--
some
of
them
since
malley,
certainly
since
kalina,
about
10
years.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
there
have
been
cases.
no
one
has
said
the
grand
jury
process
has
been
upset.
courts
have
--
have
looked
into
whether
or
not
there
was
a
complaining
witness.
some
courts
say
in
order
to
get
grand
jury
testimony
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
meet
some
kind
of
a
threshold.
often
these
cases
are
proven
up
by
deposing
the
defendant
and
asking
him
what
he
testified
about
before
the
grand
jury
without
intruding
on
the
grand
jury
at
all.
but
i
think
those
seven
circuits,
there
has
been
no
indication
of
some
kind
of
disruption
of
the
process.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
we'd
be
happy
to
file
something
further,
if
the
court
like.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
here
would
be
effectual
one,
as
you
pointed
out.
is
mr.
paulk
the
person
who
set
this
in
motion?
if
the
testimony
is
--
may
i
finish?
if
the
testimony
is
that
mr.
paulk
was
just
told
what
to
do
by
the
prosecutor
and
didn't
have
any
additional
anything,
then
perhaps
he
won't
be
found
liable
anyway.
