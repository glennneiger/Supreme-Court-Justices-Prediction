justice
antonin
scalia
mitigate?
come
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
make
her
not
a
complaining
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
prosecutor
a
complaining
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
instigates
the
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
about
the
person
who
instigates
the
instigator?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
somebody
who
comes
up
to
somebody
and
says:
you
know,
you
ought
to
--
you
ought
to
try
to
start
a
prosecution
against
this
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say:
yeah,
that's
a
good
idea.
so
that
person
goes
and
--
and
gets
a
prosecution
started.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
person
who
instigates
the
instigator?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
instigator
of
the
instigator
is
--
is
a
complaining
witness
or
can
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
know
what
the
next
question's
going
to
be,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
instigator
of
the
instigator
of
the
instigator.
i
mean,
does
this
go
back
forever?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this.
you
have
one
witness
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
that's
the
only
witness.
can
that
witness
fall
within
your
rule
and
be
the
complaining
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
pretty
risky
to
testify
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
even
though
you
haven't
--
you
don't
care
whether
it
comes
out
that
way
or
not.
you
are
subpoenaed
and
even
though
you
are
subpoenaed,
you
are
going
to
hold
me
as
a
complaining
witness.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
affiants
came
forward.
that's
a
different
situation,
isn't
it?
they
indeed
were
self-starting.
but
the
person
who
is
subpoenaed
to
testify
at
a
grand
jury
is
not
self-starting.
and
you're
saying
that
that
person's
mere
presence
and
the
mere
fact
of
that
person's
testifying
is
enough
to
hold
him
to
be
the
complaining
witness.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
hard
or
impossible?
justice
antonin
scalia
hard
or
impossible?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
word,
thank
you.
so
the
testimony
alone
cannot
be
the
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
saying
that
the
only
people
who
would
be
subject
to
suit
for
the
malicious
prosecution
tort
were
complaining
witnesses?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
acknowledge
that
if
someone
instigates
the
grand
jury
proceeding
but
does
not
testify,
that
person
could
be
sued
if
indeed
the
instigation
was
malicious?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
just
answer
my
question.
i've
given
you
a
hypothetical.
he
--
no
doubt
he
instigated
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
he
--
he
got
the
u.s.
attorney
to
bring
the
proceeding.
but
he
didn't
testify.
could
that
person
be
sued?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
he
has
to
do
to
get
himself
off
the
hook
is,
after
instigating
it,
he
should
testify,
right?
his
testimony
bathes
him
clean,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
you
are
arguing,
then,
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
other
than
the
mere
testimony;
is
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
it
was
waived.
i
don't
understand
that.
how
was
it
waived?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
