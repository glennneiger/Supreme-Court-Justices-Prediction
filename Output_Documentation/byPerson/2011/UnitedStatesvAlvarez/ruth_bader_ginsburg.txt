suppose
--
suppose,
general
verrilli,
that
the
decorations
were
left
out
and
congress
had
said:
we
don't
like
people
saying
that
they
were
in
the
marine
corps
for
25
years
when
they
never
served
for
a
single
day
in
any
armed
force.
so
they
have
a
statute
just
like
this
one,
but
it
is
directed
to
the
false
claim
that
one
has
served
in
the
armed
forces.
i
don't
see
in
your
argument
that
there
is
something
special
about
the
decorations--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
the
assumption
--
the
assumption
is
that
it's
false,
that
was
--
and
that
it's
not
so
hard
to
find
out
if
somebody
claimed
to
have
the
medal
of
honor
and
he
doesn't.
so
that
--
first
you
answered
yes,
that
it's
only
self,
and
now
you
said,
no,
it
can
be
--
or
at
least
i
think
you
said
--
making
a
false
statement
of
fact.
and
the
concern
is
--
and
i
gave
you
the
question
of
just
in
the
service,
leaving
out
the
decorations
--
other
statements
of
fact,
false
statements
like
"i
deny
that
the
holocaust
ever
occurred.
"
that's
a
statement,
a
false
statement
of
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
military
--
did
the
military
ask
for
this?
you're
claiming
there's
a
special
interest
in
seeing
that
a
military
honor
is
not
debased.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
i
mean,
it's
expressive.
one
is
i
am
speaking
through
conduct
and
the
other
is
i'm
speaking
through
words.
you
wear
the
medal
and
you
are
saying,
i
am
a
medal
of
honor
winner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
think
wearing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
wearing
of
a
military
decoration
that
you
haven't
earned,
that
that's
also
of
questionable
consistency
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
circumstances.
you
go
out
in
the
street
with
the
medal
on
you
for
everybody
to
see.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
government
has
said:
that's
not
how
we
read
the
statute,
and
the
courts
read
statutes
to
avoid
a
constitutional
collision.
so
let's
assume
that
we
are
not
going
to
cover
performances,
satire;
it's
just
a
baldfaced
lie.
that's
all
that
this
covers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
the
statute
were
amended,
as
has
been
proposed,
to
require
an
intent
to
obtain
anything
of
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
reach
this
speaker.
is
that
--
that
wouldn't
reach
alvarez,
because
he
didn't
obtain
anything
of
value.
