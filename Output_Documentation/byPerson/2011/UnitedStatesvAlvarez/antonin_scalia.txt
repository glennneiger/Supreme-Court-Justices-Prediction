justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
much
harder
to
define?
i
don't
--
why
does
the
broadness
have
anything
to
do
with
the
breathing
space?
i
mean,
i
suppose
your
argument
here
is
that
there
is
harm,
it's
not
just
falsehood,
but
it's
falsehood
conjoined
with
harm,
just
as
libel
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
--
and
in
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
just
gave,
in
your
case
there's
harm
to
those
courageous
men
and
women
who
receive
the
decorations.
in
the
--
in
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
gave,
there's
harm
to
the
people
who
honorably
served
in
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
just
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--their
service
is
demeaned
when
everybody
says,
i
served
in
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
any
difference
as
far
as
that
risk
goes.
i
--
i
hope
that
in
your
earlier
colloquy
with
justice
kennedy,
you
--
you
were
not
retreating
from
what
our
cases
have
repeatedly
said,
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
value
in
falsehood.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
this
doesn't
mean
that
every
falsehood
can
be
punished,
because
in
--
in
punishing
some
falsehoods
you
--
you
risk
deterring
--
deterring
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
believe
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
value
in
--
in
falsehood.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
even
in
the
commercial
context
we
allow
a
decent
amount
of
lying,
don't
we?
it's
called
puffing.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
--
although,
you
know,
making
false
representations
to
sell
a
product
is
unlawful,
we
do
allow
puffing,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
won't
buy
it
cheaper
anywhere
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
we
allow
a
certain
amount
of
puffing
in
political
speech
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
believes
all
that
stuff,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
commander
in
chief
sign
that,
that
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sometimes
the
harm
is
just
impairment
of
governmental
purposes,
such
as
section
1001,
which
criminalizes
the
making
of
a
false
statement
to
any
federal
agent,
for
pete's
sake.
how
do
you
justify
that?
because
the
making
of
the
false
statement
impairs
a
governmental
investigation.
and
what
is
being
urged
here
is
that
the
making
of
this
type
of
a
false
statement
impairs
the
government's
ability
to
honor
valorous
members
of
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
give
some
deference
to
congress
as
to
whether
there
is
a
harm
to
governmental
purposes
or
do
we
make
it
up
ourselves?
when
congress
passed
this
legislation,
i
assume
it
did
so
because
it
thought
that
the
value
of
the
awards
that
these
courageous
members
of
the
armed
forces
were
receiving
was
being
demeaned
and
diminished.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
charlatans.
that's
what
congress
thought.
is
that
utterly
unreasonable,
that
we
can't
accept
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
going
to
hire
people
to
follow,
you
know
--
is
that
realistic?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
is
a
sanction.
you
know
when
there
is
a
sanction
in
place
you
think
twice
before
you
tell
the
lie.
but
if
there
is
no
sanction
except
you
might
be
exposed,
who's
going
to
expose
you?
that
sanction
already
exists,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
nonetheless
who
tell
the
lie.
you
really
expect
the
government
to
hire
investigators
to
go
around
the
country
outing
people
who
falsely
claim
military
honors?
that's
not
going
to
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
giving
a
medal
of
shame
to
those
who
have
falsely
claimed
to
have
earned
the
medal
of
valor?
[laughter]
i
think
that
would
be
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
thing
of
value,
it
has
to
be
something
of
commercial
value,
right?
just
to
obtain
praise
and
the
higher
esteem
of
your
fellow
citizens,
that's
--
that's
not
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
get
a
penny
out
of
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
just
gets
the
cheers
of
the
crowd,
he's
up
there.
i'm
a
congressional
medal
of
--
the
crowd
cheers
and
they
give
him
a
parade
down
main
street.
is
--
is
that
something
of
value?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to--
