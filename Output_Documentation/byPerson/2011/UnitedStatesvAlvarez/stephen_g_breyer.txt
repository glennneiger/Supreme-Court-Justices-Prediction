obvious
example.
are
there
jews
hiding
in
the
cellar?
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
hiding
jews
in
the
cellar?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
because,
after
all,
we're
willing
to
protect
the
olympics
committee
when
a
false
person
saying
he's
the
olympics
committee
might
deprive
the
olympics
committee
of
a
penny,
while
here
they
are
saying
that
to
win
this
great
medal,
say
the
congressional
medal
of
honor,
the
highest
award
in
the
military
the
nation
can
give,
you're
deserving
of
the
most
possible,
grandest
possible
respect,
and
we
don't
even
want
you
to
have
to
think
about
somebody
having
taken
that
name
falsely,
and
so
we
will
just
criminalize
it
to
discourage
such
activity
that
undermines
the
very
thought
and
purpose
of
giving
the
medal.
all
right.
so
i'm
just
saying
in
my
mind
there
is
real
harm,
and
there
is
real
harm
and
yet
i
can
think
of
instances
where
we
do
want
to
protect
false
information.
and
i
want
you
to
accept
that
as
a
given
because
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is:
if
i'm
right
that
there
are
very
good
first
amendment
reasons
sometimes
for
protecting
false
information,
and
if
this
also
would
cause
serious
harm
that
the
government
is
aiming
after,
are
there
less
restrictive
ways
of
going
about
it?
and,
if
so,
what
and
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else
--
under
that
circumstance,
that
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
might
discourage
from
lying,
who
would
never
be
caught.
so
at
least
as
to
that
set,
exposure
won't
work.
so
you
have
a
less
restrictive
alternative
that
helps
some
but
not
completely.
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
under
my
theory.
my
theory
is
that
it
does
hurt
the
medal,
the
purpose,
the
objective,
the
honor,
for
people
falsely
to
go
around
saying
that
they
have
this
medal
when
they
don't.
okay?
so
i
might
be
wrong
about
that.
i
just
ask
you
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
argument,
because
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
i
want
as
big
a
list
as
i
can
to
think
about
of
what
the
less
restrictive
alternatives
are,
or
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
would
it
work
in
the
law
now,
where
we
have
similar
statutes,
and
there's
an
additional
requirement
when
you're
imitating,
say,
a
federal
officer
or
somebody
else
you
shouldn't,
you
have
to
perform
an
overt
act
that
asserts
authority
that
the
impersonator
claims
to
have.
what
does
that
add?
does
it
add
enough
to
just
make
it
not
pure
speech,
to
limit
--
to
wall
off
the
things
about
--
the
things
that
we're
worried
about
in
the
first
amendment.
or
there's
another
one,
you
have
to
falsely
assume
or
exercise
powers,
duties
and
privileges.
those
are
ways
statutes
have
of
limiting
this
thing.
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing
to
do
with
harm.
it's
a
way
of
walling
off
things
that
are
of
concern
under
the
first
amendment
from
those
that
aren't.
and
what
they
use
--
i
read
you
what
they
use
--
performing
--
you
know
--
you
know
the
language;
it's
written
about
in
the
briefs.
i
just
want
to
know
how
you
would
think
about
a
statute
that
imported
that
kind
of
language,
which
is
limiting
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trouble
is
you
can
think
of
10,000
instances
that
meet
your
criteria
that
one
candidate
or
another
could
bring
up
in
a
political
campaign
--
and
we
don't
know
what
will
come
up,
but
i
can
easily
think
of
examples.
and
then
if
this
is
lawful
and
constitutional,
then
you
have
people
in
political
campaigns
suddenly
worrying
that
the
u.s.
attorney
is
going
to
come
in
and
start
indicting
him.
that's
part
of
the
chilling
effect.
and
you've
assumed
you
can
get
around
this
chilling
effect,
but
i'm
less
certain.
