mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
stolen
valor
act
criminalizes
pure
speech
in
the
form
of
bare
falsity,
a
mere
telling
of
a
lie.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
lie
was
told
in
a
public
meeting
or
in
a
private
conversation
with
a
friend
or
family
member.
and
the
law
punishes
false
claims
to
a
military
award
regardless
of
whether
harm
results
or
even
is
likely
to
result
in
an
individual
case.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
just
a
pure
lie?
there
can
be
a
number
of
values.
there
is
the
value
of
personal
autonomy.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
personal
autonomy.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
that
we
get
to
--
we
get
to
exaggerate
and
create--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
when
we
create
our
own
persona,
we're
often
making
up
things
about
ourselves
that
we
want
people
to
think
about
us,
and
that
can
be
valuable.
samuel
clemens
creating
mark
twain.
that
was
creating
a
persona,
and
he
made
things
up
about
himself--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--perhaps.
but
there
are
other
things.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
people
tell
lies
allows
us
to
appreciate
truth
better.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
yes,
your
honor,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
cause
imminent
harm
to
another
person
or
imminent
harm
to
a
government
function.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
that's
right.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
and
that's--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
perhaps,
just
dealing
with
an
example
under
the
stolen
valor
act,
if
a
grandfather
were
to
make
up
a
story
that
he
had
won
a
medal
in
order
to
persuade
a
grandchild
to--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--to
join
the
military--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
another
value
is
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
was
a
limit
on
government
power.
it's
--
it's
--
our
founders
believed
that
congress
as
a
general
principle
doesn't
get
to
tell
us
what
we
as
individuals
can
and
cannot
say.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
in
all
of
those
examples,
those
are
examples
where
we
have
harm
attached
to
the
falsehood.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
we
believe
there
is
a
difference
there,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
1001,
there's
the
substantial
risk
of
imminent
harm
to
a
government
investigation.
whether
it
in
fact
causes
that
direct
harm,
there
is
still
a
significant
risk
of
imminent
harm
resulting
from
telling
a
lie
to
a
government
investigator.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
no,
your
honor.
what
we're
suggesting
is
false
statements
--
false
statements
laws
do
have
a
history
in
this
country.
and
the
court
could
recognize
a
historical
category
of
imminent
harm
or
potential
risk
of
imminent
harm
to
government
functions.
and
perjury
certainly
falls
into
that
category.
1001
very
well
may
fit
into
that
category.
since
the
beginning
of
our
nation,
congress
has
passed
these
various
false
statement
laws.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--justice
scalia,
it's
not
entirely
clear
what
congress
thought
here
because
congress
held
no
hearings
on
this.
it
made
a
broad
general
finding
that
false
statements
--
on
the
reputation--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--wearing
medals
is
a
slightly
different
category
because
there
you're
dealing
with
conduct
rather
than
content.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
it
may
be
or
it
may
be
in
doubt
under
certain
situations
where
one
is
wearing
a
medal.
but
certainly
congress
has
an
interest
in
protecting
non-expressive
purposes
of
wearing
the
medals.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
it
may
be,
your
honor.
but
again,
we
view
it
under
a
different
prism.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
that's
right.
and
as
i
said,
it
may
ultimately
be
the
case
that
the
court
finds
that,
if
in
fact
it's
unconstitutional--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--this
provision,
that
it
could
be.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
it
may
be.
but,
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
if
--
if
there
is
--
if
congress
does
not
have
a
non-speech
purpose
for
prohibiting
the
wearing
of
the
medals,
then
if
it's
strictly
an
expressive
purpose,
then,
yes,
there
would
be
a
significant
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well
--
and
that
very
well
may
be.
what
i
can
say
is
in
this
case
what
we're
dealing
with
is
strictly
a
content-based
regulation
on
speech.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
i
believe
--
what
we
believe
the
right
way
of
looking
at
this
is
you
--
you
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
imminent
harm
or
a
significant
risk
of
imminent
harm
to
an
individual
or
to
a
government
function
that
would
result
from
the
speech.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
i
guess
i'm
suggesting
the
brandenburg
standard,
which
is--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
but
the
issue
is
what
about
the
law.
and
the
issue
with
1001
and
those
false
statement
statutes
is
the
substantial
risk
of
imminent
harm
to
the
government
that
could
result
from
the
falsehood.
so
while
certainly
it
may
not
result
in
a
particular
case,
but
the
substantial
risk
of
imminent
harm--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
when
one
lies
to
a
government
investigator,
presumably
you're
doing
it
in
order
to
send
them
in
the
wrong
direction,
even
if
it
doesn't
do
that.
so
the
harm
may
not
be
there,
but
there
is
certainly
a
significant
risk
of
harm
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
protect
itself
from.
and
that's
why
we
believe
that's
where
you
draw
the
line.
and
that's
where
this
court
appears
to
have
drawn
the
line
in
those
categories
of
speech
that
it
has
said
are
unprotected,
such
as--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--your
honor,
it's
not
that
it
may
necessarily
chill
any
truthful
speech.
i
mean,
it's
--
we
certainly
concede
that
one
typically
knows
whether
or
not
one
has
won
a
medal
or
not.
we
certainly
--
we
concede
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well
--
we
do
--
well,
we
do
have
the
situation
where
we
believe
the
statute
currently
does
cover:
someone
could
be
prosecuted
for
engaging
in
parody
or
satire
or
exaggeration.
certainly
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
those--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--then
it's
still
our
position
that
it's
still
a
--
that
all
speech
is
presumptively
protected
unless
we
go
back
and
it
fits
into
one
of
the
historical
categories
of
speech
that
this
court
has
found
historically
is
unprotected.
and
there
falsity
certainly
has
never
previously
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
being
an
unprotected
category
of
speech.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
i
suppose
i
read
the
government's
argument
differently.
as
i
read
the
government's
argument,
it's
that
it's
entitled
to,
at
most,
limited
protection.
so
the
government
seems
to
start
from
the
presumption
that
it's
not
fully
protected
speech,
whereas,
of
course,
what
we
should
be
starting
with
is
the
presumption
that
it
is
fully
protected
speech
unless
this
court
has
previously
said
it's
in
one
of
these
historical
categories
of
unprotected
speech.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
that's
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
in
the
situation
with
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
you're
arguing
with
an
instantaneous
harm,
a
mental
distress
that
results
from
the
false
statement.
so
there
--
there's
imminent
harm
as
a
result
of
--
that
results
in
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
a
false
light
false--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
fits
into
the
same
category
of
mental
distress
that
we
look
at
in
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
certainly
people
are
entitled
to
be
upset
by
these
false
claims.
i
mean,
i'm
personally
upset
by
these
false
claims.
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
certain
level
of
upset
doesn't
mean
that
you're
harmed
in
the
sense
of,
of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
stress
tort,
and
so
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
simply
a
non-instantaneous
harm.
now
what
the
government
has
suggested
is
that
there
is
no
harm
that
really
results
from
a
single
claim;
that
mr.
alvarez's
falsehood
did
not
cause
harm
to
any
individuals.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
that's
certainly
part
of
it.
i
mean,
we
believe
that
there
needs
to
be
imminent
harm,
that
it
needs
to
be
targeted
harm
to
an
individual
or
to
--
to
government
function,
that
it
can't
be
the
type
of
diffuse
harm
that
the
government
goes
to
place
here--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--there
are.
first
of
all,
more
speech.
there
is
time
to
fix
the
problem.
if
someone
tells
a
lie
about
having
received
an
honor,
there
is
time
for
them
to
be
exposed.
and
in
fact
that's
what
typically
happens--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
what--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
justice
scalia,
isn't
that
exactly
what's
happening
right
now
with
this
law?
because
the
law
is
on
the
books,
the
law
is
sending
fbi
agents
out
to
investigate
these
allegations.
how
do
they
find
out
about
it?
it's
because
it's
reported.
individuals
hear
the
statement
and
they
think
it
may
be
false.
they
investigate
it.
and
--
and,
and
conduct
their
own
investigations.
so
that's
what
happens.
and
that's
what's
supposed
--
that's
--
that's
the
whole
idea
of
more
speech.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
of
course
if
you're
never
caught,
then
under
the
government's
theory,
then
no
one
has
been
harmed
individually
or--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--sure.
the
military
can
redouble
its
efforts
at
honoring
those
who
are
in
fact
entitled
to
the
awards.
there
was
a
congressional
hearing
that
suggested
that
the
military
has
been
a
little
lax
in
identifying
true
heroes
and
awarding
them
medals.
so
that
can
be
done.
the
government
can
publicize
the
names
of
true
winners.
it
could
create
educational
programs
to
let
the
nation
know
what
it
takes
to
win
these
awards,
what
these
awards
are,
who
has
won
them.
all
the
heroic
activities--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
your
honor
--
actually,
that's
certainly
something
the
government
could
do.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
a
criminal
sanction
that
puts
someone
in
prison
versus
simply
exposing
them
for
what
they
are,
which
is
a
liar.
and
mr.
alvarez,
whether
or
not
he
in
fact
was
sentenced
to
a
crime,
he
still
was
exposed
for
who
he
was,
which
was
a
liar.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
that
would
turn
the
law
into
a
fraud
statute.
and
of
course,
fraud
is
an
unprotected
category
of
speech.
so
that
certainly
would
be
a
constitutional
law.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
that's
--
i
mean,
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
what
we
do
know
is
that
mr.
alvarez
did
not
obtain
a
thing
of
value.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
yes.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
perhaps,
your
honor.
i
mean,
for
--
certainly
there
are
many
people
out
there
that
would
consider
that
to
be
a
great
thing.
there
are
also
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
don't
know
what
it
is.
and
so
to
them,
it
might
not
mean
a
whole
lot.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
it
would
--
if
it
--
again,
if
congress
were
to
amend
the
law
to
require
that
it
be
done
with
the
intent
to
obtain
a
thing
of
value,
again,
it
becomes
fraud.
and
fraud
is
something
that
the
government
does
have
the
right
to
prosecute.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--as
i
understand
the
proposed
amendment,
it
just
says
anything
of
a
non
de
minimis
value.
how
that
is
ultimately
interpreted--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--that's
right.
now,
could
it
--
could
it
be
a
nonpecuniary
thing
of
value?
as
it's
currently
proposed,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
perhaps,
your
honor.
and,
again,
it
may
come
down
to
how
the
courts
ultimately
interpret
a
thing
of
value.
it's
not
clear
that
simply
trying
to
obtain
a
vote
from
somebody
is
necessarily
a
thing
of
value,
would
be
considered
a
thing
of
value.
obviously,
if
you
promise
to
give
up
your
votes
in
office
in
return
for
support,
that
would
be
a
little
different.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
it
--
it
could
be.
again,
it
--
it
will
come
down
to
over
time,
how
that
ultimately
gets--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--that's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
sure.
i
get
that.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
your
honor,
i
think
when
it
comes
--
when
you
get
into
the
situation
where
you're
getting
something
like
a
date,
i
do
not
know
that
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
consider
that
a
non
de
minimis
thing
of
value,
but--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--well,
that
--
that
--
and
that
may
be,
which
is
why,
should
that
ultimately
become
the
law,
courts
would
have
to
look
at
that
very
closely.
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
well,
when
you
get
into
the
issue
of
impersonation,
then
you're
--
the
court
perhaps
would
be
assessing
it
under
the
amount
of
imminent
harm
to
an
individual
that
can--
mr.
jonathan
d.
libby
--it
would
be
important,
certainly
in
the
first
amendment
context,
to
limit
the
language
as
much
as
possible.
you
want
to
make
it
as
narrow
as
possible,
because,
again,
we're
supposed
to
start
from
the
presumption
that
we
--
we
have
the
right
to
say
pretty
much
what
we
want
to
say,
and
then
we
start
to
limit
it
where.
again
--
and,
i
guess,
it
goes
again
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
stevens
and
entertainment
merchants,
which
is,
is
it
one
of
these
historically
unprotected
types
of
speech
that
is
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection?
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions--
