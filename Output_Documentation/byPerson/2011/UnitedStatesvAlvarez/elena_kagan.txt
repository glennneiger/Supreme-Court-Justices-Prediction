general,
is
there--
justice
elena
kagan
--general,
what
about
these
state
statutes
--
there
are
more
of
them
than
i
thought
that
there
would
be
--
that
say
no
demonstrable
falsehoods
by
a
political
candidate
in
a
political
race,
and
prohibit
demonstrable
falsehoods
by
political
candidates?
how
would
your
analysis
apply
to
those?
would
they
come
out
the
other
end
as
constitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
it
says
demonstrable
falsehoods
about
yourself--
justice
elena
kagan
--just
about
your
qualifications,
about
what
you've
done
in
your
life,
your
--
you
know,
whether
you
have
a
medal
of
honor,
whether
you've
been
in
military
service,
whether
you've
been
to
college.
so
any
demonstrable
statement
that
a
candidate,
political
candidate,
makes
about
himself.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
more
chilling
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other.
they
are
the
same
kind
of
statement.
and
one
knows
the
same
sorts
of
things
about
oneself.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
assume
that
that
would
be
in
the
case
of
the
state
statutes
because
the
state
feels
that
it
has
a
specially
important
interest
in
maintaining
the
political
sphere
free
of
lies.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
libby,
you've
suggested
to
us
that
we
should
apply
strict
scrutiny
to
all
of
these
cases.
now,
almost
nothing
passes
strict
scrutiny.
why
should
1001
pass
strict
scrutiny?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
proposing
a
test
that
would
invalidate
all
of
the
laws
on
the
books
regarding
false
statements.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
libby,
let's
suppose
that
i
agree
with
gertz
that
there
is
no
constitutional
value
in
a
false
statement
of
fact,
and
the
reason
why
we
protect
some
false
statements
of
fact
is
to
protect
truthful
speech.
so
if,
if
that's
so,
is
--
how
is
it
that
this
statute
will
chill
any
truthful
speech?
what
truthful
speech
will
this
statute
chill?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
boy,
i
mean,
that's
a
big
concession,
mr.
libby.
then
you're
saying,
you
can
only
win
this
case
if
this
court
decides
that
the
gertz
statement
was
a
kind
of
overstatement,
an
exaggeration,
puffery.
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
extramarital
affairs?
justice
elena
kagan
the
government
has
a
strong
interest
in
the
sanctity
of
the
family,
the
stability
of
the
family,
so
we're
going
to
prevent
everybody
from
telling
lies
about
their
extramarital
affairs.
justice
elena
kagan
this
isn't
about
the
person's
own
experience,
that
the
person
knows
everything
about;
you
either
had
one
or
you
didn't
have
one.
