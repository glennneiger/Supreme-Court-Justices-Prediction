mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
military
honors
play
a
vital
role
in
inculcating
and
sustaining
the
core
values
of
our
nation's
armed
forces.
the
military
applies
exacting
criteria
in
awarding
honors,
and
congress
has
a
long
tradition
of
legislating
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
honor
system.
the
stolen
valor
act
continues
that
tradition
by
prohibiting
knowingly
false
statements
that
one
has
been
awarded
a
military
honor.
it
regulates
a
carefully
limited
and
narrowly
drawn
category
of
calculated
factual
falsehoods.
it
advances
a
legitimate
substantial,
indeed
compelling,
governmental
interest,
and
it
chills
no
protected
speech.
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
whether
that
was,
that
expression,
was
reasonably
understood
by
the
audience
as
a
statement
of
fact
or
as
an
exercise
in
political
theater.
if
it's
the
latter,
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
and
it
wouldn't
be
subject
to
liability.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i
would
say
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
numerous
contexts,
numerous
contexts,
that
the
calculated
factual
falsehood
has
no
first
amendment
value
for
its
own
sake.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
want
to
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
want
to
respond
with
precision,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
--
i
think
what
this
court
--
and
gertz
is
a
good
example
--
has
done
is
to
draw
a
line,
and
that
line
--
and
i
think
it
is
gertz
itself
that
contains
this
court's
statement
that
false
statements
of
fact
have
no
first
amendment
value.
that
doesn't
automatically
mean
that
a
false
statement
of
fact
lacks
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
--
no,
i'm
trying
to
say
something
much
narrower
than
that,
justice
kennedy,
that,
with
respect
to
factually
false
statements,
the
government
has
the
authority,
if
it
can
meet
the
"breathing
space"
principles
that
this
court's
cases
have
articulated,
along
with
the
recognition
that
factually
false
statements
have
no
intrinsic
first
amendment
value
--
those
are
substantial
constraints.
but
they
are
substantial
constraints
that
are
satisfied
in
this
case
because
the
stolen
valor
act
regulates
a
very
narrowly
drawn
and
specific
category
of
calculated
factual
falsehood,
a
verifiably
false
claim
that
an
individual
has
won
a
military
honor,
and
that's
information
that
is
within
--
and
only
punishes
speech
about
yourself.
so
it
is
speech
that
is
uniquely
within
the
knowledge
of
the
individual
speaker.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
the
decorations
matter,
justice
ginsburg.
we
--
we
think
that
that
kind
of
a
statute
would
be
a
harder
case,
and
under
the
court's
"breathing
space"
principles
closer
to
the
line,
because
the
category
is
much
broader,
much
harder
to
define,
and
it
would
depend
on
the
interest.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
--
that's
exactly
our
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
if
that
--
and
if
that
is
--
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to,
justice
scalia,
is
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--congress
--
under
this
court's
"breathing
space"
principles,
congress
would
need
to
articulate
a
substantial
interest.
we
think
that
would
likely
qualify.
we
just
think
that's
a
harder
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
that
that
case,--
your
honor,
i
think
if
it's
an
objectively
verifiable
fact
--
it
would
seem
more
likely
that
a
state
legislature
might
enact
a
law
like
that.
if
it
were
an
objectively
verifiable
fact
and
the
state
could
articulate
a
substantial
interest
of
the
kind
that
your
honor
identified--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--states
--
states
do
have
laws,
some
states
do
have
laws
respecting
false
claims
to
have
received
a
diploma
from
a
public
university.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
i
could
get
back
to
your
honor's
point
about
the
nature
of
the
harm.
it
is
true
that
in
gertz
you
had
the
particularized
harm,
but
this
court
--
the
common
characteristic
that
allowed
this
court
to
move
from
defamation
to
false
light
privacy,
to
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
in
the
falwell
case,
then
to
baseless
lawsuits,
the
sham
exception
in
noerr-pennington,
the
sham
exception
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
common
characteristic
was
not
an
analogy
to
the
particularized
harm
that
existed
in
the
defamation
context.
the
common
characteristic
that
this
court's
opinions
identify
is
the
calculated
factual
falsehood.
it
is
true
that
the
harm
here
is
different.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
--
that
is
true.
and
this
--
this
is
a
case
in
which
one
of
the
harms
that
justifies
this
statute
is
the
misappropriation
of
the
government-conferred
honor
and
esteem,
and
that
is
a
real
harm
and
a
significant
harm,
and
there
is
also
the
particularized
harm
of
the
erosion
of
the
--
of
the
value
of
the
military
honors
confirmed
--
conferred
--
by
our
government;
and
those
are
particularized
harms
that
are
real;
and
the
kind
of
speech
that
this
statute
regulates
are
a
genuine
threat
to
those
harms
in
a
way
that,
looking
backwards,
looking
and
anchoring
this
argument
in
the
tradition
of
this
court's
precedents,
this
is
a
type
of
calculated
factual
falsehood.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
three
points.
first,
if
i
could
just
make
a
general
point
in
response
to
your
honor's
question.
i
think
that
one
reality
here
is
that,
as
i
read
this
court's
cases,
this
court
has
never
held
or
even
suggested
in
any
context
when
the
government
wants
to
regulate
a
properly
defined
category
of
calculated
factual
falsehood,
that
it
has
to
meet
strict
scrutiny.
that
would
be
a
real
break
and
a
real
change
in
the
law
that
would
subject--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
--
but
--
and
again--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
that's
why
i
want
to
get
to
--
that's
--
but
i
think
it's
relevant,
your
honor,
to
the
point
about
justice
story
in
the
following
way.
the
--
the
--
there
are
a
series
of
statutes,
18
u.s.c.
1001,
18
u.s.c.
962,
the
impersonating
a
federal
officer
statute,
1001
being
the
false
statement
statute;
perjury
statutes;
those
are
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
government
processes.
there
isn't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
statute--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
not
a
--
as
--
as
i
read
what
justice
story
is
talking
about,
he
was
talking
about
the
rights
of
private
citizens,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
there
is
an
additional
category
of
long
recognized,
well
accepted
government
regulation
of
factual
--
calculated
factual
falsehood
that
serves
systemic
interests.
and,
of
course,
with
respect
to
the
stolen
valor
act,
the
--
congress
--
congress
is
building
in
the
stolen
valor
act
on
a
statute
that
congress
enacted
in
1923
which
prohibited
the
--
the
wearing
of
medals
without
justification
to
wear
the
medals.
and,
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
congress
acted
in
1923
to
do
that
was
out
of
concern
that
the
misappropriation
of
the
government
conferral
of
esteem
was
going
to
cause
substantial
harm.
that's
been
on
the
books
for
the
better
part
of
a
century,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
it
is.
that's
the
category
that
the
statute
regulates.
that
is
--
and
it
seems
to
me
in
a
situation
in
which
the
statute
is
limited
to
factually
verifiable
information,
the
person
is
speaking
about
himself
or
herself,
and
the
category
of
what's
prescribed
is
clear.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
case
in
which
under
the
"breathing
space"
principles
that
this
court
applies
when
we're
talking
about
calculated
factual
falsehood,
you
have
to
answer
a
question,
which
is,
how
much
risk
is
there
of
chilling
constitutionally
protected
speech,
because
when
you're
talking
about
somebody
else--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
that
only
--
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
that's
--
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
say
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question.
you
have--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--you
have
to
answer
the
question
in
that
case
of
whether
there
was
a
material
risk
of
deterring
expression
that's
truthful
because
--
what
--
who
knows
whether
your
grandfather
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
--
when
he
said
he
won
the
medal,
and
so
you
--
it
may
be
a
more
difficult
case.
but
under
the
court's
"breathing
space"
principles,
that's
the
question
that
one
would
have
to
answer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
it
could
be.
i
think
a
statute
seeking
to
regulate
that,
justice
ginsburg,
would
have
viewpoint
discrimination
problems
of
the
kind
that
the
court
identified
in
r.a.v.,
and
i
think
also
under
the
court's
"breathing
space"
analysis
you
would
--
you'd
have
to
look
long
and
hard
and
have
significant
concerns
about
that
kind
of
a
--
a
statement,
because
it's
so
bound
up
with
matters
of
ideological
controversy
that
--
that
you'd
want
to
exercise
care,
but
that's
really
quite
different
from
what
we
have
here.
this
is
a
pinpoint
accuracy,
a
specific
verifiable
factual
claim
about
yourself
having
won
a
medal.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
position
we've
taken
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
reason
we've
taken
it
is
because
we
read
the
court's
precedents,
gertz
and
many
others,
falwell
v.
hustler,
as
saying
precisely
that.
in
fact,
falwell
goes
a
step
further
and
says
false
statements
of
fact
are
affirmatively
harmful
to
first
amendment
interest
because
they
impede
the
--
the
search
for
truth.
that's
--
so
our
--
our
position
is
based
on
the
precise
language
of
cases
stretching
back
a
half
a
century.
garrison
said
calculated
falsehood
is
a
category
of
speech
that
is
no
part
of
the
expression
of
ideas
of
the
search
for
truth,
and
then
it
cites
chaplinsky--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
those
kinds
of
statutes
are
going
to
have
a
lot
harder
time
getting
through
the
court's
"breathing
space"
analysis
because
the
context
in
which
they
arise
is
one
that
would
create
a
more
significant
risk
of
chill--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yeah.
i
think
under
the
court's
"breathing
space"
analysis,
because
of
the
political
candidate
context,
those
statutes
are
going
to
pose
a
particular
risk
of
chill,
that
this
statute
does
not
pose
because
this
is
a
statute
about
verifiable
factual
falsehoods.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
idea
would
be,
in
a
situation
like
that
one,
the
government's
power
and
authority
is
being
trained
specifically
on
the
political
process
and
statements
in
the
political
process,
and
this
is
--
this
is
quite
different.
this
is
a
statute
that
says--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
guess
the
chilling
effect
seems
to
me,
at
least,
to
be
materially
different
than
in
a
situation
like
this
one,
where
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
very
specific
pinpoint
thing,
one
thing:
have
you
been
awarded
a
military
honor
or
not?
and
a
statement
that
is
about
yourself
only,
not
about
somebody
else,
and
is
supported
by
a
quite
strong
particularized
interest
in
ensuring
the
integrity
of
the
military
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well
certainly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
--
that's
certainly
right.
but
--
and
that
is
the
line--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
i
do
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
do
think
the
court's
--
i
do
think
the
court's
breathing
space
analysis
would
call
for
that,
i
think
that's
true.
but
this
is
a
different
concept.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
nothing
at
all,
your
honor.
and
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
and
that's
the
government's
interest
here,
and
we
do
think
that
that
kind
of
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
reason
that
i
think
our
--
we
have
a
lot
of
slippery
slope
type
questions
here
today,
but
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
--
not
to
decline
to
make
a
sound
decision
about
this
statute
based
on
concern
about
not
being
able
to
draw
the
line,
because
this
statute
is
as
narrow
as
you
can
get.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
as
a
father
of
a
20-year-old
daughter,
so
do
i,
justice
sotomayor.
but
if
i
could
take
a
minute
on
the
interest,
because
i
do
think
it's
quite
important.
i
mean,
on
some
level
of
course
it
is
true
that
no
soldier
charges
up
mount
suribachi
thinking,
well,
i'm
going
to
do
this
because
i'll
get
a
medal
if
i
get
to
the
top.
that's
not
what
the
military
honor
system--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
not
--
well,
that's
not
what
the
honor
system
is
about.
the
honor
system
is
about
identifying
the
attributes,
the
essence,
of
what
we
want
in
our
service
men
and
women
--
courage,
sacrifice,
love
of
country,
willingness
to
put
your
life
on
the
line
for
your
comrades.
and
what
the
medals
do
is
say
to,
to
our
military,
this
is
what
we
care
about.
it's
what
george
washington
said
in
1782
when
he
set
up
the
honor
system.
it's
designed
to
cherish
--
it's
designed
to
cherish
a
valorous
ambition
in
soldiers
and
to
encourage
every
species
of
military
merit.
and
what
i
think
with
respect
to
the
government's
interest
here
and
why
there
is
a
harm
to
that
interest
is
that
the
point
of
these
medals
is
that
it's
a
big
deal.
you
get
one
for
doing
something
very
important
after
a
lot
of
scrutiny.
and
for
the
government
to
say
this
is
a
really
big
deal
and
then
to
stand
idly
by
when
one
charlatan
after
another
makes
a
false
claim
to
have
won
the
medal
does
debase
the
value
of
the
medal
in
the
eyes
of
the
soldiers.
it
does
do
that.
that
is
the
government's
interest.
we
think
that
is
a
real
and
substantial
interest,
and
it's
threatened
here--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but,
given
that
this
is
a
category
of
calculated
factual
falsehood,
we
think
the
government
has
the
authority
and
the
constitutional
--
and
the
constitutional
space
to
try
to
deter
this
kind
of
speech,
as
well
as
allow
for
private
attorneys.
if
i
might--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
did
not,
justice
ginsburg,
but
under
article
i,
section
8,
congress
has
substantial
authority
to
regulate
our
armed
forces,
get
substantial
deference.
it's
not
unlike
the
statute
that
the
court
evaluated
in
the
fair
case
in
that
regard,
which
was
not
a
statute
that
the
military
--
that
the
military
asked
for,
but
congress
nevertheless
was
given
substantial
deference.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
think
the
"breathing
space"
analysis
does
a
very
substantial
degree
of
work
in
controlling
what
your
honor
is
describing
as
a
slippery
slope
problem.
the
government's
got
to
have
a
substantial
interest--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
statute's
got
to
be
narrowly
drawn.
it's
got
to
meet
all
of
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
as
i
think
i
said
in
my
--
in
my
opening
statement,
that
--
i
actually
think
that's
a
case
in
which
you
could
argue
that
one
either
way,
because
there
might
be,
if
the
government
articulated
a
substantial
interest
in
protecting
its--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
in
addition
to
the
--
in
addition
to
the
governmental
interests,
your
honor,
there's
--
it's
got
to
be
tailored
in
a
way
that
avoids
chill,
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
in
that
situation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
right.
and
that's
a
hard
case.
but
i
do
think,
with
respect
to
the
chilling
effect
analysis,
you
--
you
would,
i
think,
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
sustaining
that
statute.
but
of
course,
that's
not
the
kind
of
statute
that
we
have
here.
this
is
a
targeted
statute
that's
designed
to
deal
with
a
particular--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
--
but
that's
where
i
think
the
"breathing
space"
analysis
requires
before
a
statute
gets
upheld
that
it
not
have
that
kind
of
chilling
effect.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--this
statute
doesn't
and
that's
the
key
here.
this
statute
doesn't.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
this
statute
chills
nothing.
that
should
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
your
honor's
concern
that
with
respect
to
other
statutes
in
the
future,
they
can
be
evaluated
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
impose
a
--
a
chill
that
would
lead
as
an
instrumental
matter
to
the
conclusion
that
they
ought
not
to
be
found
to
satisfy
the
first
amendment.
as
respondent
concedes,
there
is
no
chill
here,
so
this
statute
is
constitutional.
