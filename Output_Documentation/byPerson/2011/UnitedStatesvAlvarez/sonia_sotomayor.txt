justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
may
i
pose
a
hypothetical?
during
the
vietnam
war,
a
protester
holds
up
a
sign
that
says,
"i
won
a
purple
heart
--
for
killing
babies.
"
knowing
statement.
he
didn't
win
the
purple
heart.
as
a
reader,
i
can't
be
sure
whether
he
did
and
is
a
combat
veteran
who
opposes
the
war,
or
whether
he's
a
citizen
protesting
the
war.
is
that
person,
if
he's
not
a
veteran,
having
received
the
medal,
is
he
liable
under
this
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
somewhat
dangerous,
isn't
it,
to
subject
speech
to
the
absolute
rule
of
no
protection?
which
is
what
you're
advocating,
i
understand,
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
this
speech
has
value.
i
believe
that's
your
bottom
line.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
harms
--
general,
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
going
through
the
multiple
cases
that
you
cited
in
your
brief
defining
the
various
statutes
that
basically
impose
penalties
for
impersonation
of
some
sort
or
another.
and
virtually
in
every
one
of
them,
except
perhaps
one,
there
was
either
an
economic
interest
that
was
harmed
by
the
impersonation,
either
by
the
--
by
the
very
face
of
the
statute
or
by
the
nature
of
the
claim,
a
dilution
of
a
trademark,
by
taking
on
someone
else's
valuable
property
rights.
and
so
i
went
back
reading
our
cases,
and
justice
story
many,
many
years
ago
said,
look,
falsehoods
have
no
value
as
such,
but
the
"breathing
space"
concept
is
defined
by
those
falsehoods
which
cause
injury
to
rights
that
people
possess,
to
--
to
pecuniary
interests
that
they
have,
or
to
the
reputation
of
others.
and
almost
every
statute
where
we
have
approved
a
harm
concept
as
being
permissible
for
recovery
has
affected
one
of
those
three
things.
so
please
tell
me
what's
wrong
with
justice
story's
view,
number
one;
and,
number
two,
how
does
the
definition
of
harm
fit
in
that?
what's
the
harm
here
that
fits
within
that
descriptor.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
didn't
mention
--
neither
did
justice
story.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
said
if
you
want
to
regulate
a
falsehood,
it
has
to
cause
a
harm
in
this
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
really.
they
are
intended
to
protect
the
right
of
the
government
to
secure
truthful
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
government
has
a
right
to
subpoena
you
at
trial,
subject
you
to
oath,
and
force
you
to
tell
the
truth.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
you
--
that's
a
right.
that
fits
within
story's
definition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
but
i
have
a
problem,
which
is
it's
not
as
narrow
as
it
could
get.
wouldn't
take
much
to
do
exactly
what
congress
said
it
was
doing,
which
was
to
protect
against
fraudulent
claims
of
receiving
a
medal,
and
the
example
it
used
was
someone
who
used
a
fraudulent
claim
of
receiving
a
medal
to
get
money.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
what
harm
are
we
protecting
here?
i
thought
that
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
was
to
protect
even
against
offensive
speech.
we
have
a
legion
of
cases
that
said
your
emotional
reaction
to
offensive
speech
is
not
enough.
if
that
is
the
core
of
our
first
amendment,
what
i
hear,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
court
below
said,
is
you
can't
really
believe
that
a
war
veteran
thinks
less
of
the
medal
that
he
or
she
receives
because
someone's
claiming
fraudulently
that
they
got
one.
they
don't
think
less
of
the
medal.
we're
reacting
to
the
fact
that
we're
offended
by
the
thought
that
someone's
claiming
an
honor
they
didn't
receive.
so
outside
of
the
emotional
reaction,
where's
the
harm?
and
i'm
not
minimizing
it.
i
too
take
offense
when
people
make
these
kinds
of
claims,
but
i
take
offense
when
someone
i'm
dating
makes
a
claim
that's
not
true.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
i'm
not
going
to
do
this
because
the
medal
has
been
debased.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
reality
here
is
that
this
gentleman
was
publicized,
deriled
for
what
he
did.
his
public
position
was
compromised,
as
is
the
case
with
almost
everyone
who's
caught
at
lying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
it
might--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--may
i
--
if
i
understood
your
argument,
you're
saying
historically
we
have
not
protected
false
statements
that
cause
harm.
i
think
that's
your
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
assuming
--
so
it's
--
we
do
protect
false
statements
presumptively,
but
the
historical
exceptions,
like
defamation,
are
those
that
cause
harm.
so
i
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
because
you
really
haven't
answered
his
question.
you've
dealt
with
the
government
process
cases,
although
we
could
argue
about
whether
that's
protecting
a
process
or
protecting
a
government
right
to
truthful
information.
that's
a
different
issue.
but
the
question
is
how
do
you
deal
with
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress?
because
damage,
we
require
injury,
and
it's
defined
under
law
what
kind
of
injury.
so
tell
me
how
you
define
harm
in
the
nongovernmental
situation,
number
one,
and
then
tell
me
why
that
--
this
situation
doesn't
fit
that
definition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
the
outrage
that
medal
winners,
legitimately
entitled
medal
winners,
experience
in
seeing
fake
people,
hearing
fake
people
claim
a
medal,
why
isn't
that
comparable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
asking
us
to
value
the
speech
in
context.
we're
not
talking
about
the
effect
of
the
speech
and
whether
you
can
regulate
that.
you're
asking
us
to
say,
you
know,
the
guy
who
says
he's
a
college
graduate
in
a
political
campaign,
that
could
chill
political
speech.
so
in
that
lie
in
that
context,
you
can't
sanction.
but
you
can
sanction
that
lie
in
a
different
context.
on
a
date.
i
don't
know,
because
on
a
date,
it
doesn't
chill
political
speech,
and
it
will
induce
a
young
woman
to
date
someone
who
she
thinks
is
more
of
a
professional,
because
that
harms
the
parents,
it
harms
the
family.
