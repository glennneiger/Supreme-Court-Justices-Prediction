justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
your
argument
limited
to
statements
that
a
person
makes
about
himself
or
herself?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
principal
reason
for
drawing
the
line
there?
suppose
the
statute
also
made
it
a
crime
to
represent
falsely
that
someone
else
was
the
recipient
of
a
military
medal,
so
that
if
someone
said
falsely
and
knowingly
that
a
spouse
or
a
parent
or
a
child
was
a
medal
recipient,
that
would
also
be
covered?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
would
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
really
think
that
there
is
--
that
the
first
amendment
--
that
there
is
first
amendment
value
in
a
bald-faced
lie
about
a
purely
factual
statement
that
a
person
makes
about
himself,
because
that
person
would
like
to
create
a
particular
persona?
gee,
i
won
the
medal
of
honor.
i
was
a
rhodes
scholar,
i
won
the
nobel
prize.
there's
a
personal
--
the
first
amendment
protects
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
acknowledge
that
the
first
amendment
allows
the
prohibition
or
the
regulation
of
false
speech
if
it
causes
at
least
certain
kinds
of
harms.
and
the
problem
i
have
with
your
argument
is
determining
which
harms
you
think
count
and
which
harms
don't
count.
would
you
go
as
far
as
was
suggested
earlier
to
say
that
only
pecuniary
harm
counts?
if
you
--
if
you
say
that,
then
the
--
the
classic
case
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
is
unconstitutional,
going
up
to
someone
and
saying
falsely,
your
--
your
child
has
just
been
run
over
by
a
bus.
so
how
do
we
determine
which
harms
are
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
imminent,
you
mean
--
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
standard
then
most
of
the
prosecutions
for
making
false
statements
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
are
not
going
to
survive,
are
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
then
you're
not
really
talking
about
imminent
harm,
i
don't
think.
you're
just
talking
about
harm.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
arguing
is
that
we
should
determine
that
there
are
certain
harms
that
are
sufficient
to
allow
the
prohibition
of
a
false
statement
and
there
are
certain
harms
that
are
not
sufficient,
irrespective
of
what
judgment
congress
made
about
the
significance
of
those
harms.
is
that
--
is
that
accurate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
not
--
the
answer
is
would
the
first
amendment
permit
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
sort
of
the
question
we
have
to
answer
here.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
what
the
person
gets
is
--
is
a
date
with
a
potential
rich
spouse.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
some
people
might
have
a
different
opinion.
[laughter]
