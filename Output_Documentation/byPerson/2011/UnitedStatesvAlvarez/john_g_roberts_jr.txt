chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-210,
united
states
v.
alvarez.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
where
do
you
stop?
i
mean,
there
are
many
things
that
people
know
about
themselves
that
are
objectively
verifiable
where
congress
would
have
an
interest
in
protecting.
high
school
diploma.
it
is
a
crime
to
state
that
you
have
a
high
school
diploma
if
you
know
that
you
don't.
that's
something
you
can
check
pretty
easily.
and
congress
can
say:
we
want
people
to
finish
high
school.
it's
a
big
thing
to
have
a
high
school
diploma.
so
we
want
to
make
sure
nobody
goes
around
saying
they
do
when
they
don't.
what
about
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
substantial
interest
is
the
one
that
i've
just
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
want
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understood.
the
government's
position
is
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
value
in
a
false
representation
of
fact,
by
which
i
understand
you
to
mean
not
parody
or
something
like
that,
but
a
statement
that's
intended
to
be
understood
as
true.
there
is
no
first
amendment
value
in
that
statement.
it
may
be
protected
because
of
the
"breathing
space"
argument,
but
in
whatever
context,
in
whatever
guise,
there
is
no
protection
in
that
false
representation
as
such.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
it
might
have
something
to
do
with,
whether
called
collateral
or
not,
i
mean,
i
would
think
the
concern
in
the
midst
of
a
political
campaign
is
you
have
the
u.s.
attorney
or
the
deputy
district
attorney
bringing
a
--
filing
a
prosecution
of
someone
2
weeks
before
the
election
saying,
you
lied
about
this
or
that
and
maybe
there
would
have
to
be
a
deposition
or
maybe
there
would
have
to
be
a
trial.
nothing
like
that
is
involved
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
mr.
libby.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
the
first
amendment
value
in
a
lie,
pure
lie?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
value
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
exaggerate
--
lie.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
was
for
literary
purposes.
no
one
is
suggesting
you
can't
write
a
book
or
tell
a
story
about
somebody
who
earned
a
medal
of
honor
and
it's
a
fictional
character,
so
he
obviously
didn't.
it
just
seems
to
me
very
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
a
statement
about
one's
self.
this
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--excuse
me.
sorry.
[laughter]
seems
to
me
that
the
stolen
valor
act
is
more
narrow
than
that.
and
i
would
say,
in
that
situation,
you
would
not
describe
what
the
individual
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
was
as
simply
telling
a
false
statement
about
himself.
it
is
about
whether
there
is
someone
hiding
in
the
attic.
it
is
not
about
himself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
order
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
that
that's
missing
the
limitation
that
the
government
has
read
into
this
statute:
not
damage,
not
for
parody,
not
to
avoid
the
discovery
of
someone
who
should
be
hidden,
not
in
order
to
do
something
with
respect
to
one's
grandson.
it's
just
a
purely
false
statement
about
one's
self.
what
--
what
--
what
is
the
first
amendment
value
in
that,
again?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course
they
do
in
countless
areas,
the
state
does,
whether
you're
talking
about
defamation,
trademark,
perjury,
all
sorts
of
things.
you
can't
adopt
that
as
a
general
principle
and
apply
it
without
regard
to
the
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
argue
that
the
speech
at
issue
here
is
totally
unprotected.
i
understand
them
to
argue
--
i
mean,
it
is
totally
unprotected.
i
understand
them
to
argue
that
it
can
be
limited
under
its
"breathing
space"
rationale.
in
other
words,
it's
not
within
one
of
the
categories
of
totally
unprotected
speech.
you
do
have
to
analyze
it
under
the
first
amendment
and
you
analyze
it
to
determine
if
it
chills
protected
speech.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
not
under
your
theory,
right?
i
mean,
it's
still
a
sanction
for
telling
something
that
you
say
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
whether
you
get
6
months
or
a
medal
of
shame
doesn't
matter
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
know
that?
he
was
politically
active,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
it
help
a
politician
to
have
a
congressional
medal
of
honor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
willingness
to
say
that
this
statute
is
valid
so
long
as
there's
some
benefit
to
the
person
who
lies,
it's
an
awfully
big
concession.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
--
so
if
he
makes
this
statement
at
a
debate
when
he's
running
for
office,
then
you
can
prosecute
him,
because
getting
the
office
is
presumably
something
of
value.
it
presumably
has
some
pecuniary
aspect
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
libby.
general
verrilli,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
announcement
today
in
case
11-210,
united
states
versus
alvarez.
