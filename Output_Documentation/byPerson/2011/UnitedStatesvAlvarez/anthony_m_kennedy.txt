justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
quite
correct.
it
has
said
it
often,
but
always
in
context
where
it
is
well
understood
that
speech
can
injure.
defamation,
gertz.
at
page
12
of
your
brief,
you
make
this
point,
and
it's
what
justice
sotomayor
is
indicating.
you
think
there's
no
value
to
falsity.
but
i
--
i
simply
can't
find
that
in
our
cases,
and
i
--
i
think
it's
a
sweeping
proposition
to
say
that
there's
no
value
to
falsity.
falsity
is
a
way
in
which
we
contrast
what
is
false
and
what
is
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that's
in
the
context
of
a
defamation
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
want
to
take
the
gertz
case,
where
it's
well
understood
that
defamation
is
actionable,
and
say
that
as
a
general
matter,
that
the
government
can
inveigh
against
what's
false.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
for
submitting
resumes.
that's
--
when
--
that's
fraud.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
were
--
they
were
in
the
context,
though,
of
recognized
torts,
intentional
infliction
for
emotional
distress.
here
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
can
argue
that
this
is
something
like
a
--
a
trademark,
a
medal
in
which
the
government
and
the
armed
forces
have
a
particular
interest,
and
we
could
carve
out
a
narrow
exception
for
that.
i
think
we
would
have
to
do
that.
but
just
to
say
that
the
cases
you
mentioned
say
that
there
is
no
value
to
false
speech,
i
simply
cannot
agree
that
they
stand
for
that
broad
proposition.
they
do
in
the
particular
context
of
a
recognized
tort
like
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
best
analogy
is
the
trademark
analogy,
olympic
case,
et
cetera.
you
put
that
in
a
rather
minor
--
not
as
an
afterthought,
but
it's
a
secondary
argument
in
your
brief.
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
strongest
one.
the
whole
breathing
space
thing
almost
has
it
backwards.
it
presumes
that
the
government
is
going
to
have
a
ministry
of
truth
and
then
allow
breathing
space
around
it,
and
i
just
don't
think
that's
our
tradition.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
this
does
diminish
the
medal
in
many
respects.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
matter
--
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
demeans
the
medal.
let
me
ask
you
this:
what
do
you
do
with
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
wearing
of
a
medal
that
has
not
been
earned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
you
know,
the
tinker
case
with
the
arm
band;
it's
purely
expressive
speech,
it
seems
to
me.
i
think
if
you
prevail
here
that
the
wearing
prohibition
must
also
be
in
serious
doubt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
is,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
person
who
puts
the
medal
on
his
tuxedo
that
he
didn't
earn
is
an
expressive
purpose.
that's
pure
expression.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
don't
you
think
that's
the
case?
there
is
no
non-expressive
purpose
that
i
can
think
of.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
a
basic
definition
of
fraud
in
the
criminal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
--
my
only
--
one
of
my
questions
is
the
slippery
slope
problem,
college
degrees
and
so
forth.
could
you
address
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--college
degrees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
an
opinion
announcing
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
united
states
versus
alvarez.
lying
was
his
habit.
xavier
alvarez
is
the
respondent
here.
he
lied
when
he
said
he
played
hockey
for
the
detroit
red
wings
and
that
he
once
married
a
starlet
from
mexico,
but
when
he
lied
in
announcing
he
held
the
congressional
medal
of
honor,
respondent
ventured
on
to
new
ground,
for
that
lie
violates
a
federal
criminal
statute,
the
stolen
valor
act
of
2005.
respondent
was
elected
to
the
three
valley
water
district
board
in
california.
at
a
board
meeting,
he
introduced
himself
by
claiming
that
he'd
been
a
marine
for
25
years,
had
been
wounded
in
combat
and
who
won
the
congressional
medal
--
medal
of
honor,
and
none
of
these
statements
were
true.
the
stolen
valor
act,
a
federal
statute,
provides
that
whoever
falsely
claims
to
have
won
the
congressional
medal
of
honor
can
be
fined
or
imprisoned
for
up
to
one
year.
alvarez
was
convicted
under
the
statute,
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
found
the
statute
invalid
under
the
first
amendment.
after
we
granted
certiorari,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
in
an
unrelated
case
found
that
the
act
was
constitutional
so
now,
there's
a
conflict
in
the
circuits.
it's
right
and
proper
that
congress,
over
a
century
ago,
established
an
award
so
the
nation
can
hold
in
its
highest
respect
and
esteem
those
who,
in
performing
the
supreme
and
noble
duty
of
contributing
to
the
defense
of
the
rights
and
honor
of
this
nation,
have
acted
with
extraordinary
valor.
fundamental
constitutional
principles,
however,
require
that
laws
enacted
to
recognize
the
brave
must
be
consistent
with
the
precepts
of
the
constitution
for
which
they
fought.
as
a
general
matter,
this
court
has
permitted
content-based
restrictions
only
when
they
are
confined
to
one
of
the
few
historic
and
traditional
categories
of
expression,
defamation,
obscenity
and
fraud
are
among
these
few
categories
of
punishable
speech.
absent
from
those
few
categories,
where
the
law
does
allow
content-based
restriction
of
the
speech,
is
any
general
exception
to
the
first
amendment
for
false
statements.
a
federal
criminal
statute
does
prohibit
lying
to
a
government
official,
but
statutes
of
that
sort
are
inapplicable
here.
this
court
has
not
endorsed
the
categorical
rule
that
false
statements
receive
no
first
amendment
protection.
by
its
plain
terms,
the
stolen
valor
act
applies
to
speech
made
at
anytime,
in
any
place,
to
any
person
and
it
does
so
entirely
without
regard
to
whether
the
lie
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
material
gain.
permitting
the
government
to
decree
this
speech
to
be
a
criminal
offense,
whether
shouted
from
the
rooftops
or
made
in
a
barely
audible
whisper,
would
endorse
government
authority
to
compile
a
list
of
subjects
about
which
false
statements
are
punishable.
that
governmental
power
has
no
clear
limiting
principle.
all
this
suffices
to
show
that
how
the
act
conflicts
with
free
speech
principles.
but
even
when
examined
in
its
own
narrow
sphere
of
operation,
it
cannot
survive.
in
assessing
content-based
restrictions
on
protected
speech,
we've
applied
the
most
exacting
scrutiny.
the
government
has
a
legitimate
and
even
compelling
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
system
of
military
honors,
especially
with
regards
the
congressional
medal
of
honor,
and
the
opinion
recites
the
history
of
--
of
the
medal.
although
millions
have
served,
the
award
has
been
given
only
3476
times
in
our
nation's
history.
the
rare
acts
of
courage
the
medal
celebrates
led
president
truman
to
say
he
would
"i
rather
have
that
medal
around
my
neck
than
be
president
of
the
united
states‚Äù.
the
stories
of
those
who
have
won
the
medal
inspire
and
fascinate,
and
it's
indicated
just
a
few
of
those
historical
accounts,
were
recited
in
the
opinion
but
that
does
not
end
the
inquiry.
the
restriction
on
speech
must
be
necessary
to
achieve
the
government's
interest.
there
must
be
a
direct
causal
link
between
the
restriction
imposed
and
injury
to
be
prevented.
the
government
has
failed
to
demonstrate
this
link.
beyond
general
appeals
to
common
sense,
the
government
provides
no
evidence
suggesting
that
the
public's
general
perception
of
military
medals
is
diminished
by
false
claims
like
those
alvarez
made.
in
fact,
the
contrary
appears
true.
counter
speech
has
long
been
the
first
amendment's
preferred
method
for
responding
to
falsity.
in
this
case,
the
record
demonstrates
that
even
before
the
fbi
began
its
investigation,
respondent
was
perceived
as
an
impostor.
once
his
lie
was
exposed,
he
was
ridiculed
online
and
his
resignation
was
called
for
publicly.
the
outrage
over
respondent's
lie
of
anything
served
to
reenforce
the
public's
respect
for
the
medal
and
its
true
recipients.
the
nation
well
knows
that
one
of
the
costs
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
it
protects
the
speech
we
detest
as
well
as
the
speech
we
embrace.
though
few
might
find
respondent's
statements
anything
but
contemptible,
his
right
to
make
those
statements
is
protected
by
the
constitution's
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
and
expression.
the
stolen
valor
act
infringes
upon
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
kagan
joins.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
joined.
