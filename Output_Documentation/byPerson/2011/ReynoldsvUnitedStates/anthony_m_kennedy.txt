justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
maybe
i
just
don't
grasp
the
core
of
the
case
then.
i
thought
this
was
a
criminal
conviction
and
that
you
were
arguing
that
it's
a
criminal
conviction
because
the
conduct
that's
prohibited
by
the
statute
was
conduct
that
covered
this
class
of
people
by
order
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
interim
regs.
is
that
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking,
isn't
this
is
criminal
conviction
that
resulted
from
the
fact
that
your
client
was
within
the
class
of
persons
covered
by
the
statute?
the
government
says
they
are
covered
anyway
--
you
say
they
are
covered
only
because
the
attorney
general
acted,
but
then
you
say
it's
a
criminal
--
it's
a
civil
provision?
