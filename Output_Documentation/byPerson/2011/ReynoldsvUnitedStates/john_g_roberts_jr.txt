chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-6549,
reynolds
v.
united
states.
ms.
cain.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
the
--
is
the
wetterling
act
retroactive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
know.
that's
going
forward.
but
was
the
requirement
to
register
under
the
wetterling
act,
did
that
apply
as
of
the
enactment
date
or
did
that
reach
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it
only
applied
to
that
year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
offense
were
committed
in
1994,
did
that
person
have
to
register
under
the
wetterling
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
a
notice
--
notice
and
comment
claim,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
not.
no.
your
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
there
was
no
notice
and
comment
when
he
issued
the
interim
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
there
had
been
notice
and
comment,
you
would
have
jumped
in
with
comments
that
would
have
convinced
the
attorney
general
not
to
apply
the
rule
to
your
client.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
--
your
argument
is
that
requirements
in
the
heading
for
42
u.s.c.
16913,
registration
requirements
for
sex
offenders,
means
something
different
than
requirements
in
subsection
(d),
which
the
attorney
general
can
issue
rules
about,
because
you
are
saying
although
there
is
the
requirement
that
they
register
and
comply
with
(c)
and
all
those
other
things,
when
it
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
issue
regulations
specifying
the
applicability
of
the
requirements
of
this
subchapter,
that
only
meant
the
administration
--
you
know,
provisions,
not
the
general
requirement
that
you
register
and
keep
current
and
all
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
safety
valve
to
release
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
talking
about
sort
of
in
the
weeds,
the
little
details,
not
the
underlying
requirement
of
registration,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
share
it
with
the
rest
of
us?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
that
the
one
person
who
doesn't
have
to
register
for
four
years
is
in
prison
already,
so
presumably,
he
doesn't
present
the
same
type
of
threat
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
these
registration
laws
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
providing
criminal
penalties
that
weren't
always
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
big
change.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
theory
--
your
theory
of
what
the
attorney
general
did
here,
as
you
put
in
your
--
i
forget
what,
the
regulations,
or
the
--
was
confirm
the
applicability
of
sorna,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
word
you
used,
i
think,
on
page
12
of
your
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
what
is
the
other
example
--
did
you
have
any
other
example
where
an
attorney
general
confirms
the
applicability
of
a
criminal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
different.
i
mean
if
you
are
talking
about
defining
which
drugs
are
qualified,
you
know,
under
provisions
that
criminalize
possession,
things
like
that.
that's
is
clarification
going
forward.
i
am
talking
about
straightforward
confirming,
is
what
you
say
happened
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
law
says
this
and
i
--
i
think
it
means
--
i
think
it
means
what
you
say
it
means.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
get
back
to
my
question,
which
--
what's
your
best
example
of
an
attorney
general
doing
something
like
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
here
it
says
shall.
it
says
the
attorney
general
shall
have
the
authority
to
specify
the
applicability
of
the
requirements
of
this
subsection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
we
think
congress
left
it
to
the
attorney
general
is
because
they
just
didn't
want
to
decide?
or
some
people
were
saying,
this
is
fine
but
not
retroactive
and
others
were
saying
it
should
be
retroactive.
do
you
see
any
constitutional
issues
with
congress
delegating
that
authority
to
the
attorney
general,
the
authority
to
make
the
criminal
statute
applicable
on
a
retroactive
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
cain,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
10-6549,
reynolds
versus
united
states.
i
will
announce
the
opinion
for
him.
the
federal
sex
offender
registration
and
notification
act
requires
those
convicted
of
certain
sex-related
crimes
to
provide
state
governments
with
information
such
as
names
and
current
addresses
for
inclusion
on
state
and
federal
sex
offender
registries.
the
act
includes
pre-act
offenders
among
those
whom
it
regulates,
but
it
also
says
that
the
"attorney
general
shall
have
the
authority
to
specify
the
applicability
of
the
act's
registration
requirements
to
sex
offenders
convicted
before
its
enactment."
the
basic
question
before
us
arises
out
of
facts
and
circumstances
that
are
complex,
but
for
purposes
of
this
exposition,
we
can
simplify
the
context
with
the
following
hypothetical.
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
a
sex
crime
before
the
act
becomes
law.
the
act
then
becomes
law.
the
defendant
subsequently
fails
to
carry
out
the
act's
requirements.
all
of
this
takes
place
before
the
attorney
general
has
issued
a
rule
that
specifies
that
the
act
applies
to
pre-act
offenders
such
as
the
defendant
before
us.
these
facts
raise
a
legal
question
of
whether
the
act's
requirement
apply
to
pre-act
offenders
who
failed
to
comply
with
the
act's
requirements
in
the
period
after
the
act
became
law,
but
before
the
attorney
general
validly
specify
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
pre-act
offenders.
we
conclude
that
the
act's
requirements
do
not
apply
to
this
group
of
pre-act
offenders.
our
conclusion
rests
in
part
upon
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
also
note
that
a
contrary
reading
will
create
uncertainties
about
just
how
the
statute
applies
to
pre-act
offenders,
uncertainties
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
well
suited
to
resolve.
and
we
explain
how
our
reading
likely
furthers
various
practical
congressional
objectives.
our
opinion
discusses
these
and
related
matters.
now,
as
noted
we
hold
that
the
relevant
statutory
requirements
do
not
apply
to
pre-act
offenders
prior
to
the
time
the
attorney
general
issued
valid
regulations
specifying
their
applicability.
we
reverse
a
contrary
holding
by
the
third
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
issued
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
