ms.
candace
cain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
recognizing
that
certain
offenders
convicted
before
enactment
or
implementation
of
sorna
would
be
unable
to
comply
with
sorna's
initial
registration
requirement,
congress
included
section
16913(d)
delegating
to
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
determine
whether
and
how
to
apply
sorna's
registration
requirements
to
those
offenders.
mr.
reynolds
is
one
of
those
offenders
because
he
was
convicted,
sentenced
and
released
from
prison
a
year
before
sorna
was
enacted.
but
for
a
valid
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
exercise
of
the
attorney
general's
authority
under
subsection
(d),
mr.
reynolds
had
no
obligation
to
register
sorna,
could
not
initially
register
under
sorna,
and
therefore
was
not
subject
to
sorna's
criminal
penalties.
action
by
the
attorney
general
was
needed
to
bring
offenders
like
mr.
reynolds
into
the
new
system,
and
because
those
implementing
sorna,
in
determining
whether
and
how
sorna
would
be
applied
to
pre-enactment
offenders,
would
require
time
and
consideration,
congress
left
the
wetterling
act
registration
law
in
place
for
3
years
to
ensure
that
all
offenders
would
be
covered
under
the
old
law.
and
until--
ms.
candace
cain
--the
wetterling
act,
your
honor,
was
remaining
in
place
for
3
years
and
had
a
sort
of
a
sunset
provision
under--
ms.
candace
cain
--your
honor,
actually
the
wetterling
act
was
not
effective
for
a
year
into
the
future.
ms.
candace
cain
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
wetterling
act
was
enacted
in
1996.
ms.
candace
cain
they
had
to
register,
but
there
were
no
criminal
penalties.
at
that
point
it
was
a
1994
law
called
wetterling,
and
2
years
after
under
the
lychner
act
criminal
penalties
were
added.
our
reading
better
accords
with
the
text
and
congressional
intent--
ms.
candace
cain
--your
honor,
the
wetterling
act
as
it
was
enacted
in
1994
was
a
registration
requirement
without
criminal
penalties.
in
1996
the
lychner
act
was
enacted
amending
wetterling
and
added
a
criminal
penalty,
the
federal
penalty
of
one-year
punishment
for
failure
to
register.
ms.
candace
cain
i
don't
know.
our
reading
better
accords
with
the
text
of
sorna
and
congressional
intent,
but
the
government
reading
is
simply
not
reasonable.
if
sorna
would
apply
to
all
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
offenders
on
day
1,
and
the
attorney
general
could
then
modify
in
the
future,
which
would
in
fact
--
in
effect
repeal
sorna
as
to
some
offenders,
then
you
could
have
a
situation
where
someone
was
convicted
of
an
offense
and
then
have
to
be
covered
under
sorna,
and
then
later
the
ag
could
decide
that
that
group
was
not
required
to
register.
ms.
candace
cain
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
but
we
don't
--
this
is
not
what
the
attorney
general
is
doing.
this
is
--
sorna
is
a
civil
registration
requirement
and
the
attorney
general's
deciding
whether
someone
has
to
register.
in
order
for
a
criminal
indictment
to
be
brought,
a
person
would
have
to
travel
and
then
fail
to
register.
so
it's
really
not
actually
deciding
whether
someone
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
or
convicted
of
a
crime
or
exposed
to
a
crime.
ms.
candace
cain
your
honor,
actually
what
we
are
seeking
is
the
ability
to
contest
the
attorney
general's
rule.
we're
saying--
ms.
candace
cain
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
--
failure
to
register
and
then
travel
--
i
mean
travel
and
then
fail
to
register
after
you
are
obligated
under
sorna
to
register
is
a
crime,
yes.
ms.
candace
cain
well,
your
honor,
that's
really
that
what
the
text
says,
and
our
reading
--
but--
ms.
candace
cain
--well,
your
honor,
our
case
does
not
involve
the
time
period
after
august
of
2008.
ms.
candace
cain
right.
ms.
candace
cain
yes.
our
client
traveled
in
'07.
ms.
candace
cain
well,
your
honor,
if
the
smart
guidelines
are
deemed
valid,
yes.
that
was
--
in
2008.
our
client
traveled
in
2007.
and
so
the
attorney
general's
interim
rule
is
the
rule
that
would
subject
him
to
criminal
liability.
ms.
candace
cain
your
honor,
if
the
statute
applies
from
day
1
we
would
still
contest
the
interim
rule
for
--
the
attorney
general
took
action
but
did
not
exclude
our
client.
the
attorney
general
did
what
he
was
authorized
to
do--
ms.
candace
cain
--pardon
me?
ms.
candace
cain
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
to
not
take
him
out--
ms.
candace
cain
--because--
ms.
candace
cain
--because
he
had
exercised
his
discretion
under
subsection
(d)
and
decided
not
to
exclude
our
client
from
the--
ms.
candace
cain
--statute.
ms.
candace
cain
it
would
be
his
discretion.
ms.
candace
cain
well,
that
he
would
have
standing.
that's
what
we're
trying
to
--
we're
trying
to
get
standing
to
contest
the
interim
rule.
ms.
candace
cain
if
the
statute
applied
from
day
1
without
the
interim
rule,
we
still
would
--
that
is
what
the
standing
issue
is
about.
we're
saying
that
the
interim
rule
is
the
only
rule
that
gave
--
gave
the
government
the
ability
to
include
mr.
reynolds
in
the
prosecution.
ms.
candace
cain
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
candace
cain
that's
right.
ms.
candace
cain
no,
but
the
sorna
would
not
apply
to
mr.
reynolds
before
then.
ms.
candace
cain
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
last
part.
ms.
candace
cain
that's
right.
ms.
candace
cain
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
mean--
ms.
candace
cain
--right.
ms.
candace
cain
that's
right.
ms.
candace
cain
for
our
client.
ms.
candace
cain
he
is
unable
to
comply
with
the
initial
registration
provision
under
(b)
because
he
was
released
from
prison
a
year
before
sorna
was
enacted,
so
he
could
not
meet
either
one
of
the
descriptions
of
initial
registration.
ms.
candace
cain
that's
right.
ms.
candace
cain
well--
ms.
candace
cain
--register
under
sorna,
that's
right.
ms.
candace
cain
the
problem
is
here
that
the
prosecution
--
the
attorney
general's
office
is
substituting
a
state
registration
for
the
initial
registration
under
sorna,
and
that's
just
not
what
the
text
says.
ms.
candace
cain
well,
even
the
government
agrees
in
their
brief
that
there
are
complications.
ms.
candace
cain
some
sex
offenders,
you
know,
from
the
various
states,
there
were
state
laws
that
were
varied
amongst
each
other,
and
there
was
a
federal
wetterling
act
that
had
its
own
periods
of
registration
and
different
requirements.
and
i
think
that,
um,
one
of
the
permutations,
some
of
them
are
that
some
sex
offenders
never
had
to
register
in
some
states;
some
had
been
convicted
before
and
had
served
out
their
time
and
no
longer
had
to
register;
and
some
were
released
from
prison,
you
know,
before
the
enactment
or
implementation
of
sorna.
and
an
example
of
a
permutation
that
was
going
to
have
some
cloth
for
consideration
is
the
one
that's
sort
of
an
example
in
a
different
context,
in
the
federal
register
and
in
the
government's
brief
which
is
that
certain
people
who
had
served
their
time
and
were
completely
out
of
the
system,
if
they
got
rearrested
for
a
misdemeanor,
the
attorney
general
decided
that
those
individuals
did
not
have
to
register
for
a
state
to
be
deemed
substantially
implemented
with
respect
to
sorna.
and
so
that's
an
example
of
a
type
of
decision,
a
complication
that
the
attorney
general
was
particularly
well-suited
to
deciding
in
making
that
determination.
ms.
candace
cain
any
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
that
would
bring
a
previous
offender
back
in
the
system,
if
that
person
was
just
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor,
they
would
not
--
the
state
would
not
have
to
re-register
them
in
order
to
be
deemed
substantially
compliant
with
sorna
and
get
the
firm
grant
money.
ms.
candace
cain
they
could
have
done
that,
but
they
were
concerned
about
how
you
get
the
older
conviction,
the
older
pre-enactment
people
into
the
new
system.
ms.
candace
cain
right.
they
wanted
to
have
a
new
registration,
a
new
system
that
would
start
from
a
certain
point
that
would
bring
in
new
requirements.
and
the
problem
is
how
to
get
the
people
with
the
older
convictions
and
the
older
registrations
into
the
system.
and
that
would
be
done
with
initial
registration.
but
mr.
reynolds--
ms.
candace
cain
--well,
i
think
that
it's
more
flexible
to
have
a
regulation,
and
takes
perhaps
less
time
than
legislation
to
think
of
all
the
different
permutations.
they
don't
know
every
state's
laws
and
every
state's
capabilities.
and
so
it
was
more
flexible.
and
they
could
respond
more
quickly
to
changes.
ms.
candace
cain
comply
with
missouri's
law?
the
state
law?
ms.
candace
cain
well,
your
honor,
that's
--
your
question
assumes
that
state
registration
would
suffice
for
sorna.
and
respectfully,
the
--
sorna
was
not
enacted
until--
ms.
candace
cain
--right.
well
that's--
ms.
candace
cain
--well,
he
would
have
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
initial
registration
under
sorna.
those
contain
more
requirements
than
under
the
missouri--
ms.
candace
cain
--i'm
just--
ms.
candace
cain
--with
missouri
law,
with
state
law,
would
be
to
comply
with
missouri
law
tell
missouri
he
is
leaving
and
then
go
to
pennsylvania
and
comply
with
pennsylvania
law,
perhaps.
and
that's
also
not
a
sorna
registration;
that's
a
registration
under
state
law.
we
know
from
carr
that
sorna
is
--
doesn't
create
an
obligation
until
the
statute's
effective
date.
and
the
statute's
effective
date
is
after
a
valid
attorney
general
regulation
for
purposes
of
people
like
mr.
reynolds.
ms.
candace
cain
the
initial
registration
under
sorna
could
be
updated.
the
state
registration
that
he
may
have
already
done
in
the
past
is
not
a
sorna
registration.
he
would
have
to
register
initially
again,
and
that
is
a
new
registration.
and
that
would
be
what
congress
intended,
because
their
goal
was
to
not
have
a
patchwork
of
regulations
and
rules.
so
it
would
be
a
new
registration,
but
an
update
of
a
sorna
registration
is
certainly
possible,
yes.
ms.
candace
cain
actually,
your
honor,
no.
we
actually
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
because
the
attorney
general
has
not
issued
regulations
instructing
offenders
what
to
do.
they
have
simply
issued
guidelines
telling
the
states
what
they
can
do
to
substantially
implement
sorna.
so
we
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
point
is
that
the
requirement
to
initially
register
under
sorna
was
not
effective
until
the
attorney
general
--
could
not
be
effective
until
the
attorney
general
said
so.
and
that's
what
the
statute
says
under
(d).
and
that
if
you
look
at
how
the
government
is
reading
the
statue,
you
apply
it
from
day
one,
but
yet
they
have
the
ability
to
modify
sorna,
which
in
effect
means
to
repeal
sorna's
effect
as
to
someone
in
the
future.
that
also
would
cause
a
lot
of
complications,
especially
in
the
context
i
mentioned
where
someone
with
a
misdemeanor,
you
know,
may
be
part
of
the
group
that
doesn't
have
to
register
in
the
future,
but
they
had
to
at
some
point,
and--
ms.
candace
cain
--if
you
--
they
say
that
he
was
not
part
of
the
people
that
could
register
within
a
normal,
i
mean,
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
because
of
the
state
registration.
ms.
candace
cain
but
assuming
that
that
wasn't
the
case,
assuming
he
was,
you
know,
just--
ms.
candace
cain
--okay.
ms.
candace
cain
no,
your
honor.
ms.
candace
cain
we
don't
know.
because,
again,
the
attorney
general
has
not
issued
regulations
or
guidelines
telling
offenders
what
to
do.
they
have
only
issued
guidelines
telling
jurisdictions
how
they
can
substantially
implement
sorna.
so
it's
not
as
though
--
he
cannot
register
under
sorna
until
the
attorney
general
specifies
that
he--
ms.
candace
cain
--oh,
sorry.
yes.
it
would
not
be
sufficient.
i
mean,
it
--
he
has
to
initially
register
to
register
under
sorna.
and
he
can't
do
that
until
the
attorney
general
issued
a
valid
rule,
which
--
we
are
contesting
that
the
2007
rule
is
not
valid.
we're
saying
that
our
client
has
standing
to
make
that
challenge;
we
were
denied
the
ability
to
do
that
below.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
if
there's
no
further
questions.
ms.
candace
cain
i
would
like
to
address
one
point
the
government
made,
that
there's
no
need
to
reregister
--
someone
in
mr.
reynolds'
position
--
once
they
have
been
registered
under
state
law.
they
acknowledge
the
opposite
themselves
in
footnote
12,
where
they
say
that
--
"that
a
government
or
a
state
will
have
been
deemed
to
substantially
implement
sorna
if
it
registers
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
sex
offenders
who
remain
in
the
system
as
registrants,
as
well
as
other
people.
"
so
it's
clear
that
the
government
believes
that
--
acknowledges
that
people
who
are
already
registered
must
reregister
under
sorna.
the
most
important
thing
is
that
this
--
the
sorna
statute
--
the
obligation
under
sorna
begins
with
initial
registration,
and
does
not
begin
with
a
state
registration.
and
enactment,
congress
knew
that
certain
people
would
be
unable
to
register
under
subsection
(b),
and
that
is
why
they
enacted
subsection
(d).
we
ask
the
court
to
remand
to
the
district
court,
and
to
allow
mr.
reynolds
to
pursue
his
claim.
