justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
mean
--
that
doesn't
mean
sorna
doesn't
apply,
it
means
2250
didn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
that
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
be
a
metaphysical,
but
it
may
be
that
congress
intended
the
statute
to
apply
to
people
like
your
client,
but
the
question
is
when
the
initial
registration
has
to
take
place,
and
i
took
you
as
saying
until
the
attorney
general
acts,
we
don't
know,
so
2250
doesn't
--
doesn't
criminalize
a
failure
until
he
can
know
when
he's
supposed
to
register.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--leaving
the
language
aside,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
what
justice
sotomayor
was
asking.
we
are
talking,
it
seems
to
me,
about
section
2250
--
he
was
a
convicted
of
violating
criminally
that
section
--
so
i
have
no
problem
about
the
statute
section.
applying
to
all
these
people;
it's
a
question
of
how
it
applies.
magine
with
me
that
we
have
an
individual
who
was
convicted
a
year
ago,
and
sentenced
to
a
5-year
term.
does
the
statute
apply
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
it
does.
now
he
hasn't
registered
yet.
he
is
in
jail
for
4
more
years.
so
has
he
violated
2250
so
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
thank
you.
so
a
person
who
has
recently
--
recently
committed
the
crime,
is
in
prison,
is
under
an
obligation
to
register,
is
yet
not
in
violation
because
of
the
time
for
initially
registration
--
registering
--
has
not
yet
expired.
now
let's
go
back
to
a
person
who
is
far
less
certain
how
it
applies.
he
committed
the
crime
10
or
15
years
ago.
he
has
long
since
been
released
from
prison.
there
are,
as
you
point
out,
several
categories.
one
is
a
person
who
has
to
--
who
should
under
michigan
state
law
register,
but
he
didn't.
another
is
a
person
who
did,
and
moved.
you
know,
there
are
several
categories.
now,
is
he
in
violation
of
2250?
your
point
is
he
is
immediately,
even
though
it
was
much
less
clear
that
it
applied
to
him,
much
less
clear.
and
much
less
clear
--
in
fact,
it
doesn't
say
when
he
is
supposed
to
register,
but
still,
2250
applies
to
him.
i
just
wonder
how
that
could
be,
particularly
when
we
have
three
sentences,
indeed,
which
seem
to
me
to
tell
the
attorney
general,
certainly,
please
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime.
i
thought
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime
under
2250.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
and
his
lawyer
said
in
response
to
my
question
that
one
of
the
things
she
wants
to
argue
is
that
he
cannot
be
convicted
under
2250
until
he
is
under
a
legal
obligation
to
register,
and
that
initial
registration
is
not
a
legal
obligation
until
the
attorney
general
makes
his
rules.
i
thought
that
was
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
says
--
subsection
(c)
says
he
has
to
--
not
later
than
90
days--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
you
were
reading
(c)
as
saying,
to
go
back
to
my
example,
the
person
who
was
convicted
last
year
and
has
four
more
years
to
do
his
initial
registration
--
nonetheless,
if
he
changes
his
name,
if
he
stops
being
a
student
while
in
prison,
he
has
to
register
tomorrow
or
the
day
after.
i
would
say
if
that's
your
reading
of
those
two
sections,
it's
going
to
confuse
everybody
who
is
in
prison,
as
it
did
confuse
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
alright,
then.
then
i
take
it
your
reading
is
he
does
not
have
to
fulfill
(c)
until
after
he
has
to
initially
register,
and
so
we're
back
to
the
question
of
why
you
treat
somebody
who
committed
the
crime
long
ago
with
less
clarity
--
with
less
time
to
initially
register,
with
more
confusion
from
one
jurisdiction
to
another
than
you
would
treat
a
person
who
was
convicted
last
year,
is
still
in
jail,
and
has
four
more
years
to
register.
that's
why
i
read
(d)
as
trying
to
sort
that
kind
of
thing
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
view
is
that
they
have
to
register
initially
when?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
saying
--
take
my
example.
the
person
is
in
michigan.
michigan
does
have
a
sex
registration
thing,
but
he
never
actually
did,
so
now
the
federal
act
comes
in
now
when
is
he
supposed
to
register.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
reasonable
time
and
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
three
business
days
he's
supposed
to
go
out
and
do
that
and
if
he
doesn't
do
that
he
has
committed
a
federal
crime
which
makes
no
mention
of
it,
no
mention
at
all,
and
he's
just
supposed
to
guess
that
that's
three
business
days
because
he's
a
lawyer,
is
that
why?
