it's
the
period
from
the
enactment
of
sorna
until
the
adoption
of
the
smart
guidelines,
right?
that's
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
in
--
in
this
situation:
someone
is
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
before
sorna
is
enacted;
the
shortly
after
the
statute
is
enacted
the
person
moves
to
a
new
state,
does
not
register;
then
after
that
the
attorney
general
exercising
the
authority
that
you
say
he
has
under
--
exercising
--
excuse
me,
exercising
the
authority
under
subsection
(d),
determines
that
sorna
shouldn't
apply
to
people
who
were
convicted
of
offenses
before
its
enactment?
would
that
person
have
committed
a
criminal
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
congress
wasn't
sure
whether
it
wanted
--
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
apply
sorna
retroactively,
and
--
i
just
--
and
therefore
was
willing
to
leave
that
to
the
attorney
general,
then
i
don't
understand
why
it
would
have
made
the
act
applicable
immediately
upon
enactment--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--pending
a
determination
by
the
attorney
general.
