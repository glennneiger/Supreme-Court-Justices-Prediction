justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
clarify
that
answer?
the
--
are
you
admitting
that
there
were
no
criminal
enforcement
options
for
the
attorney
general
under
the
wetterling
act
for
acts
committed
prior
to
1996?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
included
all
individuals
who
had
--
who
had
been
convicted
of
sex
abuse
acts
before
1996?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
let
me
go
back
to
that
question,
counselor
--
to
that
answer.
let's
assume
we
accepted
the
solicitor
general's
understanding
of
the
rule,
that
it
was
illegal
to
travel
--
that
you
had
to
be
--
had
to
register
from
the
start
of
sorna.
what
challenge
do
you
have
left
either
to
the
interim
rule
in
2007
or
to
the
final
rules
in
2008?
make?
what
--
what
challenge
could
you
conceivably
make?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
be
the
basis
of
that
challenge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
have
obligated
him
to
take
your
client
out
of
sorna?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
tell
me
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
be
an
abuse
of
his
discretion
if
he
didn't
take
your
client
out?
standing.
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we're
in
a
circular
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
have
commanded
him
to
take
your
client
out?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
--
you
would
have
to
bring
some
sort
of
suit
that
said
he
abused
his
discretion.
on
what
basis
would
he
have
--
what
would
be
your
claim
of
abuse
other
than,
i
really
want
my
client
out?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
impact
would
the
interim
rules
have
had
on
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
arrested
for
a
misdemeanor
to
do
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
justice
kagan's
question
was,
what
would
have
stopped
congress
from
just
saying:
you
have
to
register
on
the
day
of
passage.
there
was
nothing
to
stop
congress
from
doing
that,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your
reason
for
why
they
didn't
do
that.
they
didn't
make
it
automatic,
correct?
that's
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
--
is
there
anything
--
if
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
position,
all
your
client
had
to
do
after
sorna
was
passed
was
after
a
reasonable
amount
of
time,
or
upon
his
travel,
to
tell
missouri,
which
was
his
state
of
conviction,
that
he
was
moving.
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
not
assuming
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
he
have
been
in
compliance
with
sorna
under
the
final
rules
today,
the
interim
rules
when
they
were
passed,
or
on
the
date
that
he
left
if
he
had
when
he
traveled,
or
a
reasonable
time
thereafter,
told
his
state
of
conviction
that
he
had
moved?
would
that
have
been
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
he
have
to
do
in
addition
to
that
under
the
interim
or
final
rules?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
they
know
where
to
register?
do
you
agree
with
your
adversary
that
--
that
they
have
to
register
under
sorna?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
were
they
supposed
to
know
when
or
how
they
would
register
until
the
attorney
general
acted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
talking
about
those
people.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
the
people
who
can
comply
with
(b).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
talking
about
the
people--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
the
question
--
you
are
starting
from
a
proposition,
counsel,
it
seems
to
me,
that
congress
necessarily
and
under
all
circumstances
thought
that
it
had
to
include
pre-sorna
convictions.
but
i
don't
know
--
yes,
it
wanted
a
uniform
system,
but
it
had
state
systems
in
place,
it
had
an
imperfect
wetterling
act
in
place.
it
had
lots
of
other
mechanisms
in
place
to
punish
non-registrants.
so
you
are
starting
from
the
proposition
that
by
necessity
they
wanted
to
include
preconviction
felonies.
but
i
guess
for
those
of
us
who
believe
in
legislative
history,
and
i
know
many
of
my
colleagues
don't
believe
in
it
or
pay
attention
to
it,
there
were
two
bills
passed
on
sorna,
one
a
house
bill
that
made
it
very
clear,
explicitly
clear
that
it
applied
to
pre-sorna
conviction
felons;
and
the
senate
bill
which
under
the
label
retroactivity
had
the
terms
that
(d)
now
has.
doesn't
that
suggest
to
us
that
congress
itself
was
unsure
of
whether
it
wanted
to
include
the
pre-sorna
convictions
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
my
problem
is
that
you
make
an
assumption,
you
continue
to
make
an
assumption
that
if
the
attorney
general
hadn't
acted
--
that
the
attorney
general
was
incapable
of
acting
quickly.
i
mean,
if
the
attorney
general
had
within
a
few
months
done
what
he
ultimately
did
a
year
later
or
whatever
time
period
after,
had
come
out
and
said,
it
applies;
this
is
what
you
do;
briefly,
you
register
wherever
you
were
convicted
or
--
et
cetera,
if
you
move
or
change
your
name,
then
congress
would
have
accomplished
the
goal
it
wanted.
