ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
start
by
answering
your
question,
your
honor,
about
the
wetterling
act,
it
was
not
retroactive.
it
did
not
apply
to
pre-enactment
conduct.
it
defined
a
sex
offender,
unlike
sorna,
as
somebody
who
is
convicted
of
a
sex
offense,
and
in
guidelines
issued
after
wetterling
and
after
several
subsequent
amendments
to
the
wetterling
act,
the
attorney
general
interpreted
it
as
only
requiring
states
to
register
offenders
that
are
convicted
not
only
post-enactment,
but
post-implementation
by
the
state.
and
one
such
cite
is--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--post-implementation
by
the
states.
and
so
61
federal
register
cite
15112
is
and
so
just
one
example
of
that
type
of
regulation.
and
so
when
congress
enacted
sorna,
it
switched
from
"is
convicted"
to
"was
convicted"
in
order
to
include
pre-enactment
offenders.
justice
kagan,
to
get
to
your
question
about
why
is
it
all
so
complicated,
our
answer
is
that
it
really
is
not.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
have
applied
on
day
1
to
all
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
offenders.
and
to
start
off,
when
you
look
about
all
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementations,
this
is
an
incredibly
large
class.
there
is
existing
sex
offenders
on
day
1
and
all
existing
sex
offenders
from
many
months
and
years
going
forward
while
the
states
proceed
towards
implementation.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
in
our
view,
what
subsection
(d)
was,
essentially,
was
a
safety
valve.
it
wasn't
something
that
congress
thought
the
attorney
general
was
going
to
need
to
use,
but
it
was
something
that
was
there
for
the
attorney
general
should
problems
arise
in
the
course
of
implementation.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
at
the
--
at
the
time
he
acted,
yes.
i
suppose
the
attorney
general
could
decide
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
apply
his
regulation
prospectively
or
retrospectively.
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
the
same
result
is
reached
under
petitioner's
view.
in
petitioner's
view,
the
attorney
general
has
full
and
complete
control
of
the
light
switch.
congress
didn't
do
anything,
simply
left
it
for
the
attorney
general
to
simply
turn
the
lights
on.
we
don't
think
that's
right
for
a
number
of
different
reasons,
one
of
which
is
the
way
congress
that
delegated
authority
to
attorney
general
in
subsection
(d).
if--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--our--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--our
understanding
is
that
congress
did
know
that
it
wanted
to
include
as
a
general
matter
all
pre-enactment
--
and
again,
not
pre-enactment
but
pre-implementation
offenders
as
--
offenders
as
well,
and
i
think
we
know
that
because
when
you
look
to
the
provisions
that
actually
speak
to
what
a
sex
offender
was
required
to
do
under
the
act
--
and
there
are
six
such
provisions
--
they
all
start
the
same
way;
they
say
that
the
sex
offender
shall
do
something.
and
it
defines
the
sex
offender
as
somebody
who
was
convicted.
when
you
look
at
all
six
of
those
provisions
on
their
face,
they
apply
to
all
sex
offenders
so
defined
without
any
qualification.
and
petitioner's
view
is
that
despite
that
clear
language,
despite
the
lack
of
any
qualification
within
those
provisions,
by
virtue
of
subsection
(d)
what
congress
is
really
saying
is
that
nobody
has
to
register
until
the
attorney
general
says
otherwise.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
they
don't
have
to
register
under
sorna.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
so,
if
i
could
break
it
up
into
a
few
classes.
again,
we
are
talking
about
pretty
much
--
actually
we
are
talking
about
everybody
on
day
1.
and
for
a
number
of
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
offenders,
they
are
still
going
to
be
in
prison
on
the
day
that
sorna
was
enacted.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
okay.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
okay.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
people
in
the
second
group
i
was
going
to
talk
about
are
offenders
like
reynolds,
who
have
already
registered
before
sorna
was
enacted.
they
are
already
initially
registered.
it's
the
very
same
state
registry
system
that's
created
--
that's
sorna.
there
is
no
creation
of
any
sorna
registry
and
the
statute
itself
doesn't
talk
about
a
sorna
compliant
registry.
to
the
contrary,
it
defines
a
sex
offender
registry
in
16911,
subsection
9.
it's
on
page
10a
of
our
brief.
it
defines
a
sex
offender
registry
as
a
registry
of
sex
offenders
maintained
by
a
jurisdiction.
so
these
are
the
same
registries
that
have
been
in
existence
in
all
50
states
for
the
last
decade.
so
offenders
like
reynolds
don't
have
to
do
anything
under
(b);
(b)
simply
doesn't
apply
to
them.
they
do
however
as
i
pointed
out
have
to
comply
with
the
other
provisions.
they
do
have
to
do
what
(c)
requires,
which
is
when
reynolds
moved
from
missouri
to
pennsylvania,
he
had
to
tell
somebody.
that
is
what
(c)
requires;
it's
what
he
was
required
to
do
even
before
sorna
was
enacted;
and
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
the
subset
of
sex
offenders
that
haven't
already
registered
before
sorna
but
that
need
to
get
on
the
registry
--
afterwards,
because,
for
example,
their
sex
offense
wasn't
covered
before
sorna.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
what
we
view
(d)
is,
essentially,
is
a
safety
valve.
it
does
give
the
attorney
general
that
authority
with
respect
to
requirements,
going
but
going
forward
congress
has
set
the
baseline;
congress
has
set
the
default--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--to
release
sex
offenders
if
needed
to
--
to
perhaps
suspend
certain
registration
requirements.
and
let
me
give
a
couple
of
examples.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
i
think
it
--
i
think
arguably
it
could
be
both.
again
i
don't
think
this
is
something
that
congress
thought
the
attorney
general
was
necessarily
going
to
have
to
exercise,
and
in
fact
the
attorney
general
has
not
done
so.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
as
a
theoretical
matter,
on
its
face,
the
delegation
of
authority
in
(d)
is
--
is
quite
broad
and
plenary.
but
i--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--again,
i
say
in
theory
because
i
think
like
all
delegations
of
authority,
the
attorney
general
is
certainly
limited
to
acting
in
furtherance
of
the
purpose
of
congress,
and
here
we
know
the--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
--
i
--
i
do
know
what
case
you
are
talking
about
and
i
have
read
it,
and
that's
certainly
true.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i'm
not
saying
i
definitely
remember
the
name.
i
think
it
was
mci,
but
i
--
i
do
know
the
case
you
are
talking
about.
i
mean
here
the
word
is
specify
as
opposed
to
modify,
and
i
guess
there
could
be
an
argument--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
--
and
i
--
i
suppose
a
similar
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to
specify.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
has
to
be--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--he
was
convicted
a
year
ago.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--of
a
sex
offense?
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
in
our
view
the
statute
does
apply.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
he
has
not.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
if
i
could
start
with
2250
and
then
go
back
to
subsection
(d),
that
is
not
our
position.
2250
is
the
criminal
provision.
what
we
were
actually
looking
at
here
are
the
registered--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--let
me
make
an
important
distinction.
we're
actually
talking
about
reynolds
here.
you
are
right,
but
reynolds
was
not
convicted
and
was
not
prosecuted
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
initial
registration
requirements
in
subsection
(b);
he
was
convicted
and
prosecuted
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
timing
requirements
in
subsection
(c),
which
are
point
clear
as
applied
to
offenders
like
reynolds,
who
have
already
registered
or
already
in
the
system.
what
he
did
was
he
traveled--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i'm
sorry.
this
is
on
12(a)
of
the
summary--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--absolutely.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
again,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
and
if
it
helps,
i'd
like
to
walk
through
the
different
provisions.
the
one
thing
i
would
say
on
the
outset,
however,
is
when
you
say
that,
when
you
read
those
sections,
you
can
read
them
as
applying
to
only
postenactment
offenders,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
especially
because
of
subsection
(b),
because
on
the
day
that
sorna
was
enacted,
every
single
person
in
prison
at
that
time
was
be
definition
a
pre-enactment
offender,
and
so
on
its
face
when
you
read
subsection
(b),
it
quite
easily
applies
to
quite
a
number
of
pre-enactment
offenders.
and
the
other
point
i
would
make
along
those
lines
is
that
fact
subsection
(b)
just
doesn't
talk
about
pre-enactment,
it
talks
about
pre-implementation
offenders.
so
offenders
that
were
convicted
after
sorna's
enactment
but
before
sorna
was
implemented,
again
quite
easily
fit
not
only
within
subsection
(b)
but
within
all
the
other
subsections
as
well.
and
with
respect
to
the
interrelationship
between
them,
i
think
subsection
(a)
really
identifies
the
jurisdiction
in
which
a
defendant
needs
to
register.
so
the
first
instance
the
jurisdictions
in
which
an
offender
both
needs
to
register
and
to
keep
the
information
current.
subsection
(b)
really
serves
a
limited
purpose.
it's
an
intake
process.
it's
getting
an
offender
into
the
system.
for
offenders
like
reynolds
who
are
already
in
the
very
same
system,
there
is
nothing
to
be
done.
(b)
simply
doesn't
apply
to
them
--
(b)
is
applied
to
people
who
are
not
already
in
that
system,
and
for
those
that
can
comply
with
the
timing,
it
gets
them
in
before
their
release
to
the
community.
but
the
inability
to
comply
with
subsection
(b)
for
the
small
set
of
offenders
that
cannot
comply
were
with
the
timing
requirements,
it
doesn't
immunize
them
from
complying
with
all
the
other
registries--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that
is
not
my
reading
of
the--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--two
points
on
that.
number
one,
for
offenders
like
reynolds
that
are
already
registered,
there's
nothing
more
to
be
done
as
far
as
registration
goes.
all
that
he
needs
to
do
is
to
keep
the
information
current
and
to
keep
it
updated.
the
other
point
i
would
make,
since
we're
talking
about
2250,
congress
provided
other
protections
for
offenders
that
were
unable
to
comply
with
the
timing
requirements,
number
one
--
it
provided
impossibility
affirmative
defense
in
2250(b),
and
the
other
thing
that
congress
did
is
it
required
that
any
failure
to
register
in
order
to
be
subject
to
prevailing
sanctions,
that
it
be
a
knowing
failure
to
register.
in
other
words,
that
the
offender
know
he
has
a
registration
requirement
and
know
that
he
is
not
complying
with
that
requirement.
so
the
idea
that
there
are
some
hypothetical
or
maybe
even
not
so
hypothetical
sex
offenders
out
there
who
can't
comply
with
the
precise
timing
in
(b)
and
will
--
have
no
idea
what
they
are
required
to
do,
they
are
not
going
to
be
criminally
liable
under
2250
because
there
is
an
impossibility
defense.
and
to
the
extent
they
don't
know
that
they
have
a
registrational
requirement,
they're
also
not
going
to
be
criminally
liable
under
2250.
and
so--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that's
absolutely
right.
the
reason
--
the
release
from
prison
is
the
trigger
and
the
concern
and
the
reason
we
have
registration
is
for
periods
of
time
where
these
offenders
are
released
into
the
community.
and
that's
why
the
timing
requirement
in
(b)
is
there.
the
notion
is
that
before
offenders
are
released
into
the
community,
we
want
to
get
them
on
the
registry
rolls,
we
want
to
be
able
to
track
them
from
the
day
that
they're
released.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
if
they
have
not?
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
he
is
to
register
within
a
reasonable
time.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
given
the
rest
of
the
requirements
something
probably
along
the
lines
of
give
or
take
three
business
days.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
actually
it's
not
unique
with
respect
to
the
statute,
it's
quite
common
for
status
offenses,
and
let
me
try
to
give
one
example.
one
of
the
statutes
that
the
court
looked
at
fairly
recently
922
g
9
makes
it
unlawful
to
possess
a
fire
arm
after
having
a
conviction
for
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
that
statute
applied
in
1996
and
applies
to
everybody
convicted
of
a
domestic
violence
offense.
so
if
an
individual
had
domestic
violence
conviction
in
1990
and
had
a
fire
arm
in
his
possession
forever
the
last
20
years
when
the
statute
passed
in
1996
he
was
in
violation
of
the
statute.
of
course
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
unless
he
was
given
some
reasonable
time
to
get
rid
of
the
fire
arm.
but
there
is
nothing
years
ago
with
respect
to
that.
and
again,
the
criminal
provision
here
2250
provides
additional
protections
it
has
an
affirmative
defers
for
impossibility
and
it
requires
that
there
be
knowledge.
so
for
an
offender
that
knows
he
is
required
to
register
he
is
given
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
come
into
compliance
with
that
registration
requirement.
reynolds
in
particular
is
an
example
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
reynolds
knew
he
was
required
to
tell
somebody
when
he
moved
from
missouri
to
pennsylvania.
he
knew
that
because
he
signed
registration
forms
in
missouri
telling
him
as
much.
and
those
are
in
the
joint
appendix
after
pages
16.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
they
were
--
they
were
under
missouri
law,
but
the
important
point
for
sorna
purposes
is
that
he
knew
he
had
a
registration
requirement.
he
doesn't
have
to
know
what
law
it
arises
under.
and
again,
the
sex
offender
registries
that
pre-existed
sorna
are
the
exact
same
sex
offender
registries
that
sorna
is
using.
sorna
was
enacted
in
2006;
it
wasn't
starting
over;
it
wasn't
starting
from
scratch.
wanted
to
build
on
the
previous
regime.
it
it
wanted
to
fix
it
and
make
it
better
and
fill
in
gaps
and
fill
in
loopholes
and
stitch
all
of
the--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--well,
the
criminal
penalties--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--the
criminal
penalties
--
the
federal
felony
criminal
penalties
were
not
there
before.
wetterling
did
have
a
misdemeanor
penalty,
and
a
number
of
states
did
have
penalties,
but
again
the
criminal
penalty
is
distinct
from
the
registration
requirement,
which
is
what
we
are
actually
looking
at
and
what
we're
interpreting.
the
registration
requirement,
violation
of
which
can
result
in
criminal
penalties
in
certain
circumstances;
but
again,
congress
provided
additional
protections
for
those
circumstances.
the
registration
requirements
themselves
not
only
apply
to
sex
offenders
and
tell
sex
offenders
what
they
are
required
to
do,
it
also
tells
states
and
other
jurisdictions
what
they
are
required
to
do
if
they
want
to
--
implement.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
our--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--we
did.
one
of
the
things
he
did
was
confirm.
in
the
interim
rule
the
attorney
general
in
the
preamble
section
read
the
statute
exactly
as
we
read
the
statute.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
don't
know
if
i
would
say
confirm.
there
are
certainly
are
other
examples
where
the
attorney
general
has
had
authority
and
exercised
authority
to
define
certain
aspects
of
criminal
law,
touby
is
one
example
of
such
a
case.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
oh,
well--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
think
there
are
a
number
of
examples
where
for
example,
agencies
do
little
more
than
restate
what
the
statute
says.
i
think
the
court
doesn't
give
deference
in
those
circumstances,
but
it
certainly
is
within
the
scope
of
the
general
authority
of
an
agency
or
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
to
reiterate
the
statute's
requirement.
the
attorney
general
went
--
went
a
step
further
in
the
interim
rule
in
that
what
the
attorney
general
said
in
the
preamble
is
i
read
the
statute
as
written;
i
think
it
applies
facially
to
all
sex
offenders
regardless
of
the
date
of
conviction
but
i
understand
the
defendants
are
making
an
argument
to
the
contrary,
and
in
an
abundance
of
caution
to
foreclose
that
argument
to
the
extent
i
need
to
do
something
under
subsection
(d)
i
am
doing
it
now;
and
i'm
saying
that
yes,
it
applies
to
all
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
offenders.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
confirming?
i
don't
know
if
i
have
one
in
a
criminal
context
exactly,
but
i
think
the
point
maybe
that
your
honor's
getting
at;
and
you
can
certainly
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong;
might
be
a
point
that
you
made
earlier.
it
certainly
is
somewhat
unusual
delegation
of
authority
to
the
attorney
general.
if
congress
had
wanted
the
attorney
general
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
registration
requirements
at
the
very
core
of
this
statute
had
any
operative
effect
going
forward,
presumably
it
would
have
told
the
attorney
general
that
he
needed
to
do
something.
that's
something
that
congress
did
in
many
other
provisions
of
sorna
where
congress
said
the
attorney
general
shall
do
something.
in
fact,
more
than
a
dozen
provisions
congress
used
that
language
to
direct
the
attorney
general
to
take
a
certain
action.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
but
it
says
shall
have
the
authority.
and
i
think
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
shall
specify
and
shall
have
the
authority
to
specify.
the
latter
is
a
passive
delegation
of
authority;
it's
a
permissive
delegation.
it
suggests
that
the
congress
did
not
think
that
the
attorney
general
had
to
do
something
for
the
statute
to
apply
as
written.
it
suggests
that
the
statute
applied
on
day
1
to
all
pre-enactment
and
pre-implementation
offenders
as
all
the
other
subsections
that
set
forth
the
registration
requirements
suggest,
but
if
the
attorney
general
in
the
future
sees
a
need
to
specify
the
applicability
going
forward,
then
he
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
not
that
he--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
don't
think
so,
and
for
two
reasons.
first,
to
address
the
bills
themselves,
i
don't
think
the
senate
bill,
just
like
i
don't
think
subsection
(b)
means
that
congress
meant
to
apply
the
registration
requirements
to
all
pre-enactment
offenders
in
the
registration
provisions
and
then
take
away
that
provision
in
the
specify
the
applicability
provision.
in
the
senate
bill
that
you
are
talking
about
it
defined
a
sex
offender
as
anybody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
and
as
this
court
said
in
carr,
that
is
the
language
that
congress
quite
often
uses
when
it
intends
to
include
pre-enactment
conduct.
so
i
think
the
verb
choice,
both
in
the
senate
bill,
in
the
house
bill,
and
in
the
bill
that
was
actually
enacted,
indicates
that
it
did
intend
to
include
pre-enactment
offenders.
the
other
point
i
would
want
to
make
is
again,
another
point
that
was
made
in
carr,
which
is
that
the
registration
requirements
stand
at
the
very
center
of
congress's
efforts
to
find
and
to
register
the
100,000
missing
sex
offenders
that
have
fallen
off
the
registry
rolls
under
the
previous
regime.
so
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
with
respect
to
sorna
that
congress
did
want
to
include
pre-enactment
offenders;
it
wanted
to
not
only
find
those
missing
sex
offenders;
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
got
back
on
the
registry
rolls.
and
as
far
as
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
offenders
that
were
already
on
the
registry
rolls
when
sorna
was
enacted,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
stayed
on
the
registry
rolls,
that
they
kept
the
information
current;
they
continued
to
update
their
information
going
forward.
and
again,
with
respect
to
pre-enactment
offenders
that
were
in
prison
at
the
time
that
sorna
was
enacted,
it
wanted
to
make
sure
to
get
them
on
the
registry
rolls
before
they
left
prison,
before
they--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--if
--
if
the
--
if
congress
had
wanted
the
attorney
general
to
act
and
to
act
quickly,
presumably
congress
would
have
told
the
attorney
general
that
he
had
to
do
something.
again,
that's
something
congress
did
in
many
other
provisions
of
sorna.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
because
when
the
attorney
general
issued
the
interim
rule,
what
he
said
was
that
reading
it
on
the
face,
i
do
think
it
applies
to
everybody,
but
i
recognize
the
defendants
are
making
an
alternative
argument
and
i
think
it's
incredibly
important
that
it
apply
to
everybody,
and
that
it
apply
to
everyone
quickly,
because
we
are
talking
about
protecting
our
communities;
we're
talking
about
protecting
the
public
and
protecting
our
children
from
sex
offenders,
and
having
this
uncertainty
out
there
is
--
is
not
only
not
good
for
protecting
the
public,
but
it's
not
good
for
sex
offenders;
it's
not
good
for
jurisdictions
that
are
trying
to
work
towards
substantial
implementation
of
sorna.
and
so
i
think
you
could
look
at
it
one
of
two
ways.
if
the
idea
is,
well,
congress
left
it
to
the
attorney
general,
but
the
attorney
general
sort
of
acted
very
quickly,
i
think
that
suggests
that
there
probably
wasn't
that
much
for
the
attorney
general
to
do
in
the
first
place,
and
there
is
little
reason
that
congress
would
not
have
made
that
decision
on
its
own.
to
the
extent
you
think
there
was
a
whole
bunch
of
things
for
the
attorney
general
to
do,
which
again
we
disagree
with,
presumably
that
is
something
that
would
take
some
time.
during
the
interim
period
those
100,000
sex
offenders
would
remain
missing;
additional
sex
offenders
would
be
added
to
that
number
and
the
community
and
public
would
continue
to
be
at
risk
going
forward.
if
there--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that's
what
congress
did.
of
course,
we
don't
think
so
we
--
we
do
think
that
the
notion
that
congress
would
delegate
such
a
fundamental
issue
to
the
attorney
general
in
such
subtle
and
opaque
terms
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
think
he
needed
to
do
anything
is
quite
significant
when
you
look
to
see
what
--
what
congress
was
intending.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
strengthen
our
case
here--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--it
does,
but
we
do
think
there's
a
different
starting
point.
and
the
different
starting
point
is
a
fundamental
difference,
as
your
honor
noted.
our
argument
looks
like
a
lot
like
prosecutorial
discretion,
whereas
the
other
starting
point
is
that
congress
decided
something
and
left
it
all
to
the
attorney
general.
