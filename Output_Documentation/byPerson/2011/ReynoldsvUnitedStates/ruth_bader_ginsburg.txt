justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
--
maybe
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
that
power.
but
your
position
is
that
whether
this
behavior,
not
registering,
is
criminal
or
not,
is
left
up
to
the
attorney
general
--
is
left
up
to
the
executive.
do
we
have
other
examples
where
congress
says,
well,
we
don't
know
whether
this
should
be
a
criminal
offense,
so
we're
going
to
leave
it
to
the
attorney
general?
it's
quite
different
to
say
the
attorney
general
will
implement
it
in
the
technical
details,
but
to
say
that
whether
it's
a
criminal
offense
or
not
is
up
to
the
attorney
general,
is
there
any
other
instance
where
that's
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
we
do
--
the
attorney
general
has
spoken.
the
first
time,
you
say
it
was
ineffective
because
there
was
no
notice
and
comment.
but
from
--
what
is
it
--
august
of
1908,
we
have
a
rule,
a
final
rule,
that
did
go
through
notice
and
comment.
so
are
we
talking
about,
is
this
case
simply
about
the
period
from
february
1907
to
august
1908,
and
that's
--
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case,
only
those
people?
or
are
you
contesting
that
after
august
1908,
you
still
have
some
kind
of
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
this
whole
case
is
about
what
happens
between
february
'07
and
august
'08,
and
that's
the
limit
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there
was
no
rule
at
all
before
february
'07
and
there
was
a
rule
august
'08?
so
it's
just
that
period
this
case
is
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
--
but
what
you're
challenging
is
interim
rule,
because
there
was
no
notice
and
comment.
so
you
would
have
had
no
challenge,
not
from
the
date
of
sorna's
enactment,
but
from
the
date
of
the
rule
that
you're
challenging
--
and
that
rule
was
february
'07.
your
challenge
is
to
invalidity
of
the
interim
rule,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
so
--
but
before
there
was
an
interim
rule,
you
would
have
no
such
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
might
have
some
other
case,
but
this
case
is
about
a
challenge
to
a
rule
as
invalid.
that's
--
that's
--
as
i
understand
it,
so
that
had
to
be
a
rule
in
order
for
you
to
make
the
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
challenging
the
--
the
attorney
general's
first
rule
as
invalid,
the
february
'07
rule.
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
say
it's
invalid
because
there
was
no
notice
and
comment.
you
have
no
challenge
--
your
challenge
doesn't
reach
before
that,
because
there
was
no
rule
before
that.
so
that
you
can
--
the
earliest
point
is
when
the
rule
was
adopted,
you're
saying
the
rule
was
invalid.
so
that's
why
i
said
the
brackets
are
from
when
there
was
an
allegedly
invalid
rule,
which
was
in
february
'07,
until
when
there's
a
valid
rule,
which
is
in
august
of
'08.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
--
is
this
case
--
what
would
compliance
entail
other
than
simply
telling
the
missouri
authority
that
he
had
to
register,
was
registered
in
missouri,
telling
missouri
authority
that
he
was
moving
to
another
state.
that's
all
he
had
to
do,
right,
to
comply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
comply
with
the
sorna
requirement,
that
he
would
have
to
tell
the
missouri
authority
that
he
was
moving
to
another
state.
and
then
missouri
would
have
an
obligation
to
tell
that
other
state
he's
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking
about
sorna
has
been
enacted,
and
now
he's
moving
after
sorna
is
enacted,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
so
sorna
is
on
the
books.
he's
registered
in
missouri.
he's
leaving
the
state
to
comply
with
sorna.
what
does
he
have
to
do
other
than
tell
the
original
state:
i'm
moving
to
another
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
can't
comply
with
the
initial
registration
because
he
committed
a
crime
even
before
sorna
was
enacted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now,
what
would
he
have
to
do
to
be
in
compliance--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--under
the
current
regulation,
under
the
19
--
i
mean
the
'08
regulations,
wouldn't
be
enough
to
comply
for
somebody
in
his
situation,
to
comply
simply
by
telling
his
parole
officer:
i'm
moving
to
the
other
state,
under
the
regulation
that
says
how
this
is
implemented?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
my
question,
which
was
the
same
thing:
why
isn't
it
sufficient
now
for
him
simply
to
tell
his
parole
officer
he's
moving.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
were
under
missouri
law
not
under
federal
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
did
--
the
attorney
general
didn't
try
to
act
very
quickly,
and
if
the
attorney
general
thought
that
sorna
applied
from
day
1,
why
is
the
attorney
general
trying
to
go
through
regulation
that
said
nothing
more
than
sorna
applies?
