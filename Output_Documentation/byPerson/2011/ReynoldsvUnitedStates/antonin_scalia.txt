well,
i
--
you
know,
my
problem
is,
that's
very
strange.
i
--
i
find
it
very
strange
to
--
to
leave
it
up
to
the
attorney
general
whether
something
will
be
a
crime
or
not.
it
will
be
a
crime
if
the
attorney
general
says
so
and
it
won't
be
a
crime
if
he
doesn't.
i
mean,
especially
leave
it
up
to
the
attorney
general,
for
pete's
sake;
he's
the
prosecutor.
you
know,
it
will
be
a
crime
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
it
is
and
it
won't
be
a
crime
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
it
isn't.
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
parallel
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
sailing
close
to
the
edge
of
unconstitutionality;
whereas,
what
the
other
side
claims
is
simply,
it's
a
crime
to
begin
with,
but
the
attorney
general
can
make
it
not
a
crime.
that's
sort
of
like
prosecutorial
discretion.
in
--
in
his
--
in
his
judgment,
if
it
shouldn't
be
a
crime,
you
know
--
i
have
trouble
with
that,
too.
but
it's
a
lot
closer
to
prosecutorial
discretion
than
--
than
--
than
what
you're
asking
us
to
accept,
that
something
is
a
crime
only
if
the
attorney
general
says
it's
a
crime.
seems
to
me
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
argument
is
further
that
without
the
rule,
sorna
doesn't
exist,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
post
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
had
a
case
involving
the
meaning
of
modify,
and
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
mean
repeal.
so
he
presumably
couldn't
suspend
the
whole
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
authorized
the
fcc
to
modify
the
requirement
to
post
rates,
and
the
fcc
simply
eliminated
the
requirement
to
post
rates,
and
we
said
that
that
was
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
do
you
want
to
tell
us
where
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
helpful
to
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
strengthen
your
case
if
you
at
least
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
doubtful.
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
it's
bad,
but
if
you
said
it's
doubtful,
it
might
strengthen
your
case,
wouldn't
it?
