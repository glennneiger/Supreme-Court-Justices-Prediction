justice
elena
kagan
ms.
cain,
why
do
you
think
congress
would
have
written
the
text
in
this
way?
you
said
it
was
very
complicated
and
congress
was
worried
about
different
problems,
the
way
different
registrations
overhappened
on
each
other
but
exactly
what
was
so
complicated?
why
couldn't
congress
just
have
applied
the
statute
to
people
in
mr.
reynold's
situation
itself?
justice
elena
kagan
i
was
going
to
ask
the
what
are
the
government
the
same
question.
what
are
the
complications
that
congress
was
so
worried
about?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
is
--
why
is
it
easier
for
the
attorney
general
to
do
that
by
regulation
than
for
congress
simply
to
do
it
by
the
statute
itself?
what
did
they
expect
to
happen
in
the
regulatory
process
that
would
solve
these
problems
for
them?
justice
elena
kagan
could
you
tell
me
this,
ms.
cain.
you
may
have
said
this,
and
i
may
just
have
missed
it.
but
under
the
new
regulations,
a
man
who's
in
the
position
of
your
client
and
who
cannot
initially
register
under
(b),
b
just
doesn't
fit
his
circumstances,
does
he
now
have
to
initially
register
again,
or
does
his
initial
registration
stick
and
he
just
has
to
update
it
when
he
moves?
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
as
i
indicated.
why
would
congress
have
given
you
the
authority
to
exempt
people?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
burden
is
on
you
in
the
exact
same
way
it
is
on
ms.
cain.
justice
elena
kagan
but
does
that
mean,
ms.
sherry,
that
--
that
the
attorney
general
could
if
he
wanted
to,
for
whatever
reason,
could
exempt
all
pre-enactment
offenders
from
sorna?
justice
elena
kagan
it
would
allow
that.
so
when
you
say
it
gave
the
attorney
general
the
ability
to
confirm
or
modify
the
requirement
in
section
(a),
you
mean
he
could
if
he
wanted
to
exempt
all
pre-enactment
offenders?
justice
elena
kagan
to
confirm--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
you're
suggesting,
ms.
sherry,
that
(b)
and
(c)
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other,
and
in
fact,
one
can
read
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
as
all
integrally
linked
and
referring
only
to
postenactment
offenders,
so
(a)
is
the
umbrella
provision;
it
says
"a
sex
offender
shall
register
and
keep
the
registration
current.
"
(b)
says
how
you
shall
register
initially,
and
(c)
says
how
you
shall
keep
that
registration
current.
so
all
three
of
these
refer
only
to
postenactment
offenders.
and
then
(d)
comes
along
and
says,
by
the
way,
the
attorney
general
can
apply
all
of
this
to
pre-enactment
offenders
as
well,
and
can
specify
how
to
do
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but
it
would
also
work
that
is
--
that
might
against
your
own
interpretation,
because
your
own
interpretation
allows
you
to
exempt
anybody
you
want
from
the
statute;
isn't
that
right?
