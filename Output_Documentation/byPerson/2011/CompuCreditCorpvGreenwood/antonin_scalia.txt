right.
and
--
and
you
don't
need
a
magic
word,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
need
something
more
than
a
provision
dealing
with
what
you
have
to
tell
to
the
people
who
--
who
accept
these
contracts.
i
mean
it's
not
in
the
substantive
part
of
the
statute.
it's
in
the
part
of
the
statute
that
tells
you
what
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
act
you
have
to
notify
the
consumer
of.
it's
a
very
strange
way
for
congress
to
say,
"no
arbitration".
by
putting
this
language
in
a
section
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rights
under
the
act.
it
is
intended
to
be
a
summary
of
the
rights
under
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
gilmer
would
have
come
out
differently
with
regard
to
one
of
the
procedural
rights
involved
in
that
case
if
the
statute
had
happened
to
refer
to
procedural
right
as
a
right?
procedural
rights
are
rights,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
if
the
statute
in
gilmer
had
referred
to
one
of
the
procedural
rights
in
passing
as
a
right,
do
you
think
that
one
would
have
been
nonwaivable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
procedural
rights
are
rights.
to
denominate
it
as
a
right
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
--
in
answer
to
my
question
you're
saying
that
just
because
the
statute
refers
to
procedural
rights
as
rights,
just
as
we
do.
all
of
a
sudden,
simply
because
the
statute
uses
our
normal
language,
procedural
rights
are
elevated
to
the
level
of
substantive
rights
and
can't
be
waived.
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
effectively
referring
to
a
procedural
right
as
a
right
creates
any
inference
at
all.
it
is
a
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
--
well
i
guess
it
goes
farther
than
that,
your
argument
does,
it
seems
to
me.
your
argument
is
the
waiver,
the
non-waiver
of
rights
provision
would
normally
be
read
to
mean
non-waiver
of
substantive
rights,
but
the
notice
given
to
the
consumer
here
which
refers
to
the
procedural
right
to
sue
as
a
"right"
eliminates
that
presumption.
so
i
presume,
therefore,
that
your
position
is
that
all
procedural
rights
under
this
statute
cannot
be
waived.
because,
i
mean,
that's
what
we
are
talking
about,
what
does
right
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
it
says
rights
are
not
waived?
and
our
prior
case
law
says
ordinarily
that
means
only
substantive
rights;
but
here
in
this
statute,
it
refers
to
the
right
to
sue
which
is
certainly
is
a
procedural
right
as
a
right.
so
i
presume
all
the
other
procedural
rights
in
this
statute
likewise
cannot
be
waived.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
there
are
--
none.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
a
settlement
is
a
waiver
anyway.
it's
a
vindication.
you
vindicate
your
right
to
a
settlement.
i
don't
know
that
you
waive
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
another
case
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondents
are
individual
who
applied
for
and
received
a
credit
card
marketed
and
issued
by
the
petitioners.
in
their
applications,
respondents
agreed
to
resolve
any
claims
against
petitioners
by
binding
arbitration.
in
2008,
they
filed
a
class
action
complaint
against
petitioners
in
federal
district
court
alleging,
as
relevant
here,
violations
of
the
credit
repair
organizations
act.
that
act
regulates
the
practices
of
credit
repair
organizations,
which
are
defined
as
certain
entities
that
offer
services
for
the
purpose
of
improving
a
consumer's
credit
record,
credit
history
or
credit
rating.
the
claims
in
the
case
largely
involve
petitioners'
allegedly
misleading
representation
that
the
credit
card
could
be
used
to
rebuild
poor
credit
and
their
assessment
of
multiple
fees
upon
opening
of
the
accounts
which
greatly
reduced
the
advertised
credit
limit.
the
district
court
denied
petitioners'
motion
to
compel
arbitration
of
the
claims,
concluding
that
congress
intended
claims
under
the
credit
repair
organizations
act
to
be
nonarbitrable.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
background
law
governing
the
issue
before
us
is
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
requires
courts
to
enforce
agreements
to
arbitrate
according
to
their
terms.
that
is
the
case
even
when
the
claims
at
issue
are
federal
statutory
claims
unless
the
faa's
mandate
has
been
overridden
by
a
contrary
congressional
command.
we
hold
that
the
credit
repair
organizations
act
contains
no
such
override.
the
act
does
not
expressly
forbid
arbitration
but
respondents
point
to
the
act's
disclosure
provision,
which
sets
forth
a
statement
that
the
credit
repair
organization
must
provide
to
the
consumer
before
any
contract
is
executed.
one
sentence
of
that
required
statement,
and
--
and
it's
verbatim,
in
the
statute
reads
as
follows,
"you
have
a
right
to
sue
a
credit
repair
organization
that
violates
the
credit
repair
organizations
act.
respondents
maintain
that
this
provision
gives
consumers
the
right
to
sue
in
a
court
of
law
and
because
the
act
also
prohibits
the
waiver
of
any
rights
that
it
provides,
the
arbitration
agreement,
which
waived
the
right
to
bring
an
action
in
a
court
of
law,
cannot
be
enforced.
we
disagree.
the
disclosure
provision
creates
only
a
right
for
consumers
to
receive
a
specific
statement
set
forth
in
the
statute,
describing
in
laymanâ€™s
terms
and
does
necessarily
incompletely
the
consumer
rights
that
the
law
elsewhere
provides.
it
purports
to
be
not
a
creation
of
rights
but
a
summary
of
rights
created
under
other
provisions.
the
right
to
which
the
right
to
sue
language
refers
is
contained
in
the
act's
civil
liability
provision
which
gives
consumers
the
right
to
enforce
a
credit
repair
organization's
"liability"
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
act.
respondents
point
out
that
that
provision,
the
one
that
does
create
the
right,
uses
terms
such
as
"action",
"class
action"
and
"court",
terms
that
call
to
mind
judicial
proceedings,
but
arbitration
awards
are
enforced
and
can
be
challenged
in
court.
the
fact
that
ultimately
consumers
under
the
act
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
does
not
establish
that
they
have
a
right
to
initial
judicial
enforcement
displacing
the
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
have
held
that
similar
provisions
in
other
statutes
do
not
preclude
arbitration
agreements.
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
the
credit
repair
organizations
act
in
1996,
arbitration
clauses
in
contracts
of
the
type
at
issue
here
were
no
rarity.
quite
the
contrary,
the
early
1990's
saw
the
increased
use
of
arbitration
clauses
in
consumer
contracts
generally
and
in
financial
services
contracts
in
particular.
had
congress
meant
to
prohibit
these
very
common
provisions,
it
would
have
done
so
in
a
manner
much
more
direct
than
what
respondents
suggest.
because
the
credit
repair
organizations
act
is
simply
silent
on
whether
claims
under
the
act
can
proceed
in
an
arbitrable
form,
the
federal
arbitration
act
requires
the
arbitration
agreement
here
to
be
enforced
according
to
its
terms.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
kagan
joins.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
