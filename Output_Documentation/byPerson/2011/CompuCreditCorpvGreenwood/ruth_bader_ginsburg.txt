mr.
mcconnell,
you
started
with
the
notion
that
the
disclosure
provision,
the
statute
is
meant
to
apply
to
ordinary
people
and
if
an
ordinary
person
not
schooled
in
the
law
read
"you
have
a
right
to
sue.
"
wouldn't
they
understand
that
to
mean:
i
have
a
right
to
sue
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
act
in
gilmer
did
not
designate
court
action
or
right
to
sue
as
a
right
within
the
non-waivable
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
know,
if
this
were
written
to
be
read
by
and
understood
by
lawyers,
i
think
you
would
have
a
stronger
argument.
but
this
is
meant
for
consumers,
and
they
read
"you
have
a
right
to
sue,
and
that
right
is
not
waivable.
"
"a
right
to
sue,
they
are
not
going
to
think
about
cause
of
action.
"
"they
don't
know
what
cause
of
action
is.
"
"but
they
do
know
that
a
right
to
sue
is
a
right
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
in
--
is
that
in
the
statute?
or
is
it
just
a
colloquial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
title
vii
doesn't
say
"right
to
sue".
it's
a
name
that
the
agency
uses,
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
in
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
have
a
right
to
sue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
not
what
the
parties
decide.
these
are
take
it
or
leave
it
contracts.
so
the
consumer
doesn't
really
elect
arbitration.
it's
just
presented
as
part
of
the
terms
that
the
consumer
can
take
or
leave
and
not
negotiated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
question
of
whether
we
take
that
into
account
in
--
in
determining
what
"you
have
a
right
to
sue.
"
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else
is
nonwaivable
besides
the
three
days
to
back
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
your
position
of
right
to
a
lawsuit,
would
that
extend
to
a
post-dispute
genuinely
bargained
for
right
to
arbitrate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
another
argument
that
is
made,
and
perhaps
to
your
position,
is
that
the
statute
says
that
any
waiver
of
any
protection
or
right
may
not
be
enforced
by
any
court
or
any
other
person.
and
the
suggestion
is
"any
other
person"
must
contemplate
an
alternate
dispute
method
that
doesn't
involve
court,
court
or
any
other
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
but
this
arbitration
agreement
precludes
class
action,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
nelson
just
said
no,
that
his
position
does
include
that
fact.
and
i
asked
him
about
post-dispute
and
he
brought
up
settlement
as
well.
he
said
that
their
interpretation
does
not
exclude
settlement,
in
which
the
plaintiff
agrees--
