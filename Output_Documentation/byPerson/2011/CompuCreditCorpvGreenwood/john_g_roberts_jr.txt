we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-948,
compucredit
corporation
v.
greenwood.
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
a
--
the
word
"lawsuit"
typically
describes
an
arbitration
proceeding?
if
you're
subject
to
an
arbitration,
would
you
say,
i'm
in
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
a
right
to
sue
refer
to
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
way
you
could
do
it
is
that
the
right
to
sue
is
more
familiar
colloquially.
if
somebody,
you
know,
hits
your
car
and
you
jump
out
angrily
and
you
say
--
you
can
say:
i'm
going
to
sue
you.
you
are
not
likely
to
say:
i'm
going
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
against
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
argument
that
the
consumer
retains
the
right
to
sue
since
they
can
go
into
court
with
their
complaint,
but
it's
simply
the
rule
that
the
court
will
apply
is
that
you
have
to
proceed
to
arbitration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
frequently
--
that's
frequently
the
way
these
issues
come
up.
i
mean,
people--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
cannot
be
forced
to
arbitrate
either
under
the
agreement
or
any
other
provision,
they
will
bring
their
complaint
in
court,
and
then
there
will
be
a
judicial
resolution
of
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
should
go
to
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree,
i
take
it,
that
you
would
lose
if
the
statute
said
"you
have
a
cause
of
action?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
in
an
agreement
waive
the
provisions
of
1679g(b)
that
specify
what
a
court
shall
consider
in
awarding
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
what
--
what
if
you
don't
want
your
arbitrator
to
consider
those
four
requirements?
could
you
waive
particular
aspects?
i
mean,
that
tells
you
that
--
first
of
all,
it
says,
of
course,
"the
court
shall
consider"
but
i
take
it
your
position
is
when
they
say
"the
court",
they
mean
the
court
or
arbitrator?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one
of
those
rules
of
construction
is
that
you
don't
read
statutes
when
--
to
the
extent
they
lead
to
absurd
results.
i
think
you
can
still
say
follow
the
plain
language,
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
you
can't
enter
into
a
settlement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
no
right
to
time
before
the
court.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
in
case
10-948,
compucredit
corporation
versus
greenwood.
