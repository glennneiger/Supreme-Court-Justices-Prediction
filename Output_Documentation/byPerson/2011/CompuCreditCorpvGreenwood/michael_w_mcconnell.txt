mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
consistently
rejected
the
argument
that
federal
statutes
that
both
create
a
right
to
sue
and
also
bar
waiver
of
rights
under
the
statute
are
sufficiently
explicit
to
override
the
strong
federal
policy
in
favor
of
arbitrability
expressed
in
the
federal
arbitration
act.
in
two
of
those
cases,
gilmer
and
piette,
the
court
construed
a
statute
the
relative
language
of
which
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
that
and
the
credit
repair
organization
fact
that
we
have
before
us
today.
those
cases
involve
the
adea.
both
the
adea
and
croa,
as
i
will
call
it,
create
a
cause
of
action
for
aggrieved
parties
to
bring
actions
for
damages.
and
both
statutes
explicitly
bar
waiver
of
quote
"any
right
under
the
statute".
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
that's
the
sole
distinction
between
the
two
statutes.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
the
--
first
of
all
the
disclosure
statute
is
a
--
describes
in
layman's
terms,
gives
a
quick
description
of
an
operative
civil
liability
section
which
is
set
out
in
1679(g)
and
which
tells
us
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
creating
a
cause
of
action.
and
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
actual
operative
provisions
in
(g),
it's
almost
as
if
congress
deliberately
went
out
of
its
way
to
use
language
that
would
not
preclude
arbitration.
that
language
provides
that
a
person
who
violates
the
statute
shall
be
liable
to
the
persons
to
whom--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
kagan,
i
think
that
would
be
exactly
the
same.
because
a
cause
of
action
and
a
right
to
sue
are
the
same
thing.
they
mean
the
same
thing
and
this
court
has
consistently
since
mitsubishi
held
that
just
because
congress
creates
a
cause
of
action
which
is
a
right
to
sue
does
not
preclude
arbitration.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
adea
context,
the
government
itself,
the
eeoc
sends
discriminated
against
workers
a
right-to-sue
letter
that
tells
them
they
have
a
right
to
sue.
but
this
court
has
twice
said
that
does
not
preclude
arbitration.
and
that's
because
a
right
to
sue
is
simply
a
cause
of
action.
it
doesn't
actually
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
exclusively
a
right
to
be
in
court.
it
gives
you
rights
which
may
be
vindicated,
and
there
are
various
ways
in
which
they
can
be
vindicated.
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
provides
that
the
--
that
this
court
or
that
the
courts
must
enforce
private
contractual
agreements
that
provide
for
the
vindication,
even
of
statutory
rights
through
arbitration.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
justice
alito,
i
can
imagine
it.
now
congress
has
to
date
has
not
used
it.
congress
knows
perfectly
well
how
to
bar
arbitration.
they
have
done
it
in
a
number
of
statutes.
in
fact,
in
the
very
congress
that
enacted
croa,
there
were
three
different
statutes
that
were
proposed
that
would
have
eliminated
arbitration
for
particular
statutory
schemes.
none
of
them
were
adopted.
but
congress
is
perfectly
aware
of
how
to
do
this.
i
don't
think
they
have
to
use
the
magic
words
"no
arbitration",
but
they
certainly
have
to
do
something
considerably
more
direct
than
this.
here
they've
created
a
statute
that
provides
that
there
must
be
liability
and
creates
a
cause
of
action,
and
then
they
tell
people
in
a
separate
disclosure
provision
--
by
the
way,
added
very
late
in
the
drafting
process,
right
--
simply
to
tell
people
that
they
have
what
is
colloquially
known
for
laymen
as
a
right
to
sue.
now,
we
lawyers
call
things
causes
of
action.
we
call
on
things
like
the
right
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
that
is
lawyers'
language.
but
when
ordinary
people
talk
about
that,
they
think
that's
a
right
to
sue.
but
a
cause
of
action
and
a
right
to
sue
are
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
first
of
all,
only
our
waiver
argument
depends
upon
those
particular
cases;
we
have
a
second
argument.
but
nonetheless,
i
think
this
comes
from
the
very
long
tradition,
at
least
back
to
the
1980s
in
mitsubishi,
of
understanding
that
arbitration
is
a
choice
of
a
forum,
but
it
must
vindicate
the
substantive
rights
of
the
particular
statute.
so
this
is
the
way
courts
have
talked
about
the
relationship
between
arbitration
and
the
substantive
statute.
so
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
see
what
are
the
prohibitions,
what
are
the
substantive
rights
and
so
forth,
and
the
arbitrators
enforce
all
of
those,
but
that
the
term
rights
does
not
include
--
it
does
not
mean
that
there
is
an
exclusively
judicial
forum,
just
that
whoever
is
the
decisionmaker
is
going
to
enforce
exactly
the
same
set
of
substantive
rights
which
are
in
the
statute.
but
justice
kagan,
even
if
that
were
not
persuasive,
congress
is
perfectly
aware
that
that's
the
way
that
this
court
had
been
interpreting
the
words,
because
gilmer,
which
interprets
the
very
words
5
years,
before
enactment
of
this
statute.
and
we
know
congress
was
aware
of
gilmer,
because
the
very
same
congress
that
passed
croa
also
considered
a
bill
considered
a
bill,
considered
and
rejected,
a
bill
that
would
have
reversed
the
decision
in
gilmer.
so
gilmer
and
the
very
question
of
--
of
arbitration
was
before
this
congress,
and
they
knew
that
the
word
"any
rights"
was
interpreted,
interpreted
by
this
court,
the
way
that
it
was
in
gilmer,
and
they
used
precisely
the
language
that
was
interpreted
that
way
in
gilmer.
and
so
at
this
point
there's
a
vocabulary.
it's
like
there
is
a
glossary,
congress
is
using
it,
and
even
if
it
may
not
be,
you
know,
fully
textual,
as
you
say,
that's
--
that's
the
way
congress
now
addresses
the
matter.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg
and
the
question
is
does
it
matter.
i
would
say
anyone
looking
at
the
adea's
language,
which
says
that
an
aggrieved
person
may
bring
a
civil
action
in
court,
anyone
would
say
that
that
is
a
right
to
sue.
it
is
surely
a
right.
and
indeed
when
this
court
interpreted
that
statute
in
piette,
this
court
called
it
a
right
--
a
right
to
a
judicial
forum.
three
times
in
the
opinion,
the
court
refers
to
that
as
a
"right".
and
the
fact
that
our
statute
here
refers
to
a
right
to
sue,
rather
than
a
right
to
bring
a
civil
action,
seems
--
certainly
against
the
backdrop
--
recall,
please,
that
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
has
explicitly
abrogated
the
--
specifically
disavowed,
specifically
barred
the
use
--
the
arbitrability
of
the
--
of
the
contract,
and
that
all
doubts
are
supposed
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
arbitrability,
and
the
--
the
statutes
must
be
interpreted
with
a
healthy
regard
for
the
policy
in
favor
of
arbitrability.
considering
this,
and
considering
the
paltry
basis
in
the
text
for
--
for
that
conclusion,
i
don't
see
how
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
can
be
withstood
--
could
be
upheld.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
refers
to
a
cause
of
action,
your
honor,
and
we
can
call
that
a
lawsuit,
too.
often
that's
another
layman's
term
for
a
cause
of
action,
but
this
court
has
held
i
don't
know
how
many
times,
i
believe
it's
at
least
six
times
since
--
since
mitsubishi,
that
just
because
congress
creates
a
cause
of
action
and
says
that
it
will
be
in
court,
that
does
not
mean
that
--
that
that
does
not
preclude
arbitration,
that
that
creates
a
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
the
--
the
underlying
logic
of
this
is
that
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
or
of
a
right
to
sue,
which
i
many
suggest
is
a
synonym
for
cause
of
action,
is
--
is
not
inconsistent
with
arbitration;
it's
the
precondition
for
arbitration.
if
there
were
not
a
cause
of
action,
there
would
be
nothing
to
arbitrate,
right?
so
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
a
legal
arbitration,
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
it
might
arise
from
contract,
it
might
arise
from
a
statute,
but
in
every
single
arbitration
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
if
this
court
were
to
interpret--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
ginsburg,
again,
if
that
is
so,
it
would
apply
to
other
cases
in
which
the
language
"right
to
sue"
is
used.
for
example,
the
eeoc's
right
to
sue
letters,
what
could
be
more
explicit
than
that?
but
this
court
has
held
several
times
that
just
because
the
eeoc
sends
a
right
to
sue
letter
doesn't
mean
that
congress--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--it's
in
the
regulations,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
what
the
statute
says
is
you
may
bring
a
suit
in
court.
and
so,
if
this
court
--
i
do
not
see
how
the
court
can
say
that
the
right
--
that
the
language
"the
right
to
sue"
is
different
from
a
right
of
action.
it
certainly
--
it
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we
have
--
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
when
congress
appended
a
disclosure
provision
toward
the
end
of
the
drafting
of
this
statute
and
simply
used
a
colloquial
version
of
cause
of
action
so
that
ordinary
people
would
understand
that
they
intended
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
operative
provision.
the
operative
provision
tells
us,
i
think
very
clearly,
what
congress
meant,
and
then
in
this
sort
of
quick
shorthand,
colloquial
way,
they
are
telling
people,
yes,
they
have
an
action,
but
just
like
they
have
an
action
--
persons
have
an
action
under
the
sherman
act,
they
have
an
action
under
rico,
they
have
an
action
under
the
adea
and
they
have
an
action
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
in
all
of
these
cases
people
have
a
right
to
sue,
but
this
court
has
held
that
arbitration
vindicates
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--it
does
happen
rather
often.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
--
i
would
say
no.
what
i
would
say
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
question
of
arbitrability
has
been
put
before
the
court
and
the
court
will
decide
whether
to
enforce
the
arbitration
clause
or
not.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
exactly,
exactly.
so
in
this
sense,
it's
not
that
the
cause
of
action
goes
away.
it's
not
the
--
the
cause
of
action
is
not
being
waived.
it's
simply
being
vindicated
in
a
different
way,
in
a
way
which
congress
in
the
arbitration
act
has
told
us
is
perfectly
appropriate,
just
as
appropriate
as
a
--
as
a
vindication
in
court,
and
that
we
should
leave
it
to
--
and
that
the
--
a
contract
between
the
parties
to
decide
which
of
the
forums
for
vindication
of
their
rights
would
be
used
should
be
enforced.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
is
an
argument
against
arbitration
that
this
court
has
rejected
several
times.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
ginsburg,
congress
--
that's
a
policy
question
and
congress
has
given
us
an
answer.
recently,
by
the
way,
congress
has
indicated
a
slightly
different
answer
which
will
affect
cases
like
this
in
the
future.
as
part
of
the
dodd-frank
regulatory
reform
bill,
congress
required
the
new
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
to
conduct
a
serious
study
of
the
use
of
arbitration
procedures
in
consumer
financial
matters
to
find
out
whether
things
like
what
you
refer
to,
justice
ginsburg
--
the
--
the
types
of
contracts
and
so
forth
are
fair
to
consumers.
so
we'll
get
an
authoritative
answer
to
this,
and
congress
then
vested
this
new
bureau
with
authority
either
to
outlaw
arbitration
awards
or
to
require
conditions
or
to
reform
them.
but
in
the
meantime,
the
policy
that
congress
has
set
is
the
policy
in
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
is
one
of
a
--
a
strong
policy
in
favor
of
enforcing
arbitration
contracts.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
unless
congress
has
indicated
otherwise.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
kagan,
i
do
not
see
how
it
would
be
any
different
from
a
consumer
who
reads
any
of
the
statutes
that
this
court
has
held
are
subject
to
arbitration.
if,
for
example,
in
the
truth
in
lending
act,
which
this
court
interpreted
in
the
green
tree
case
that
as
part
of
the
arbitration
contract
it
was
required
to
send
the
consumer
a
copy
of
the
statute.
the
consumer
would
read
in
the
statute
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
that
they
can
bring
suit
in
court
to
enforce
their
rights
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
they
would
read
that
statute
and
they
would
draw
exactly
the
same
conclusion
that
they
do
from
the
shorthand
layman's
language
of
"a
right
to
sue".
but
again,
even
if
that
were
so,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
--
of
how
--
statutory
interpretation,
that
a
disclosure
provision
cannot
change
the
meaning
of
the
operative
section.
the
operative
section
which
creates
the
rights
and
liabilities
here
is
1679g,
and
not
even
respondents
seriously
claim
that
that
section
is
--
shows
congressional
intent
to
prevent
arbitrability.
and
that
seems
--
the
fact
that
there
is
a
disclosure
provision
that
uses
more
informal
language
instead
of
the
lawyers'
language
used
in
1679g
does
not
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remaining
part
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
actually,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
this
statute
specifically
does
not
require
--
it
contemplates
but
does
not
require
our
--
class
actions.
if
you
look
at
--
at
1679b(a)(2)(b),
which
is
the
class
action
provision
that
is
on
page
59(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
--
to
the
petition,
all
that
it
says
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
class
action,
here
is
how
we
would
--
here's
how
the
damages,
the
punitive
damages,
would
be
calculated.
it
does
not
say
that
there
must
be
class
actions.
it
doesn't
make
that
a
non-waiverable
right
at
all.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
actually,
my
answer
to
you
is
that
it's
not
a
right
to
begin
with--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--whether
waiverable
or
not.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
may
i
--
if
we
were
to
hypothesize
that
the
statute
did
provide
that
there
shall
be
class
provisions,
which
this
does
not
--
i
think
this
statute
is
agnostic
on
that,
but
the
hypothetical
statute
were
class
actions
are
contemplated,
i
would
not
argue
that
that
is
necessarily
waiverable.
what
i
would
argue
is
--
is
that
that
could
be
vindicated
through
arbitration,
that
there
can
be,
as
this
court
discussed
just
last
term
in
concepcion,
there
can
be
class
arbitration
proceedings--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes,
it
does.
and
again,
this
statute
does
not
require
that
there
be
class
proceedings,
i
am
only
addressing
a
hypothetical
statute
that
did.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
and
that
seems
to
me
just
a
further
reason
not
to
interpret
a
disclosure
provision
with
a
layman's
language
as
importing,
you
know,
very
specific
legal
notions.
i
think
this
simply
means
--
right
to
sue
simply
means
cause
of
action.
and
it's
--
each
of
the
rights
i
should
point
out
in
the
disclosure
provision
is
--
has
its
actual
textual
home
elsewhere.
none
of
them
are
created
in
the
disclosure
provision.
each
of
them
is
created
elsewhere,
either
in
this
statute
or
another.
to
find
out
exactly
what
they
entail,
you
look
to
the
substantive
provisions.
here,
you
would
look
to
1679g,
and
you
would
see
that
class
actions
are
possible,
but
not
required
under
this
particular
statute.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
most
lower
courts
create
the
right
to
punitive
damages
as
a
substantive
right
which
would
not
be
waiverable.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
means
the
decisionmaker.
many
statutes
of
course
refer
to
things
that
courts
might
do,
even
though
those
statutes
can
be
vindicated
in
arbitration.
title
vii
for
example
has
several
provisions
in
which
it
says
if
the
court
determines
this,
then
it
may
do
that,
for
example,
issuing
injunctions
and
so
forth.
i
--
when
you
import
the
substantive
provisions
of
a
statute
into
an
arbitration
proceeding,
everything
that
would
be
substantively
available
from
a
court
becomes
available
from
the
arbitrator,
and
that's
the
way
i
would
read
the
punitive
damages
section
here.
i
note,
by
the
way
--
if
i
might
just
respond
to
a
few
of
the
points
made
by
my
friend
in
response
to
questions
--
begin
with
justice
sotomayor's
interesting
question
about
the
fact
that
the
statute
appears
to
make
even
offering
a
waiver,
offering
an
arbitration
clause,
a
violation;
it's
actually
even
worse
than
that
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
under
their
reading,
a
settlement
is
surely
just
as
much
a
waiver
as
an
arbitration
is.
now,
they
say,
well,
oh,
well,
it
only
means
post-dispute
waivers,
but
that
is
not
what
this
statute
says.
this
statute
is
about
all
waivers.
in
contrast
to
other
statutes
previously
enacted,
like
the
adea,
which
distinguish
between
pre-dispute
and
post-dispute
waivers,
this
one
does
not.
so
their
position
suggests
that
even
a
settlement
offer
is
a
violation
of
this
statute.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
was
his
answer,
but
what
that
tells
us
is
that
he
is
he
is
not
giving
us
a
plain
language
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
is
all
that
they
have.
their
entire
position
is
based
upon
a
plain
language
reading
of
the
statute.
remember
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
begins
its
opinion
by
quoting
alice
in
wonderland.
it's
--
it's
all
about
plain
language,
but
they
do
not
offer
us
a
plain
language
interpretation
of
this
statute.
in
order
to
avoid
absurd
consequences
like
making
settlement
offers
a
violation
of
the
statute,
they
have
to
create
exceptions,
unspecified
exceptions,
to
the
text.
it
would
be
much
easier
simply
to
follow
the
rules
of
construction
that
this
court
had
announced
before
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
against
which
congress
operated.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
it's
easier
though
simply
to
assume
that
congress
was
using
words
in
the
way
that
this
court
used
them
in
gilmer
just
a
few
years
before,
that
that's
a
much
more
straightforward
way
of
reading
the
statute.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
just
as
i
think
you
can
say
that
when
you
go
to
arbitration,
you
vindicate
the
substantive
rights
of
the
statute
as
well,
and
indeed
this
court
has
used
that
very
language
in
mitsubishi
with
respect
to
--
to
arbitration.
the
--
just
a
couple
of
other
small
points.
my
friend
points
out
that
this
is
the
first
statute
in
--
that
at
the
time
of
this
statute
in
1996,
that
there
had
been
no
statute
that
explicitly
barred
arbitration,
which
is
historically
true
but
i
think
not
particularly
revealing.
it
was
only
in
'85
in
mitsubishi
and
then
'91
in
gilmer
that
congress
became
aware
that
it
needed
to
do
this
in
statutory
causes
of
action.
and
in
--
by
1996,
they
were
considering
bills
that
explicitly
avoided
arbitration
clauses.
they
weren't
enacted,
but
this
is
for
political
reasons.
remember
the
political
composition
of
congress
in
1996.
it
is
not
surprising
that
statutes
voiding
arbitration
agreements
become
more
common
when
the
political
composition
of
the
congress
changes.
this
is
fundamentally
a
political
choice,
and
ought
to
be
--
we
ought
to
respect
the
choices
that
congress
has
made.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
waive
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
unless
it's
an
un-waivable
right.
