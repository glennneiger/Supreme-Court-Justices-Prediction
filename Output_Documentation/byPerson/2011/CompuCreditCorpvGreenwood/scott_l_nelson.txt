mr.
scott
l.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
credit
repair
organizations
act
provides
consumers
with
what
it
explicitly
denominates
a
right
to
sue,
and
then
it
says
that
any
right
of
the
consumer
under
the
statute
is
non-waivable.
as
this
court
has
said--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--there
is
--
there
is
a
technical
violation
in
asking,
because
in
1679f
not
only
are
waivers
made
unenforceable,
but
it
is
--
it
is
prohibited
to
ask
someone
to
waive
their
rights.
however,
that
does
not
mean
that
you
actually
have
a
cause
of
action
to
go
in
and
sue
somebody
for
that,
because,
remember,
under
1679g,
what
you
can
sue
for
is
your
money
back.
if
somebody's
asked
you
for
a
waiver
and
you
didn't
sign
the
contract
and
you
didn't
pay
them
any
money
--
or
your
damages;
somebody
asked
you
for
a
waiver
and
you
never
signed
up
with
them,
you
don't
have
any
damages;
and
then
punitive
damages
in
addition,
which
--
you
know,
the
general
rule
about
punitive
damages
is
you
get
them
on
top
of
actual
damages
if
you
have
actual
damages.
so,
yes,
it's
a
technical
violation.
if
a
company
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
it,
the
ftc
could
quite
rightly
go
in
and
get
an
injunction
against
that.
but
it's
not
a
case
where
there
would
be
some
onerous
penalty
imposed
on
a
company
merely
for
asking
for
a
waiver.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
want
to
take
that
in
two
parts,
because
the
first
was
--
was
tied
to
the
--
the
attempt
to
procure
a
waiver
and
whether
that
calls
into
question
whether
congress
really
could
have
meant
this.
it's
sort
of
an
unusual
provision
to
say
not
only
can
you
not
waive
rights,
but
it's
a
violation
even
to
ask
somebody
to
waive
them.
but
that's
no
more
unusual
with
respect
to
the
right
to
sue
than
with
respect
to
any
other
right
under
this
statute.
for
example,
the
right
to
cancel
after
3
days.
everybody
would
concede,
i
think,
that
that's
a
non-waivable
right
under
the
clear
language
of
this
statute.
it's
an
unusual
and
perhaps
onerous
provision
to
say
that
if
somebody
just
suggested
that
you
waive
that
right
to
cancel
and
you
never
actually
waived
it,
they
still
violated
the
statute.
but
you
know,
that's
what
congress
wrote
here,
because
in
this
statute,
it
was
concerned
with
an
industry
that
it
saw
as
overreaching
pervasively
in
relation
to
the
people
that
it
was
--
it
was
trying
to
sign
up
for
its
services.
and
that's
why
congress
wanted
a
very
strong
prohibition
of
waiver
of
rights
that
even
attempted
--
that
even
extended
to
attempt.
now,
as
to
the--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--first
of
all,
the
rules
--
the
rules
are
not
that
congress
has
to
be
especially
clear
in
this
context.
and
in
fact,
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
in
the
line
of
cases
starting
with
mitsubishi,
mcmahon,
rodriguez
de
quijas
and
gilmer
that
what
has
to
be
discernible
--
and
this
also
gets
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
--
it
merely
has
to
be
discernible
from
the
text
or
the
legislative
history
or
the
structure
and
policies
of
the
act
that
--
that
there's
an
intent
to
preclude
waiver
of
the
right
to
judicial
remedies.
that's
not
an
unmistakable
plain
statement
of
rule;
it's
not
a
requirement
of
explicitness
in
the
sense
of
explicitly
using
the
term
"arbitration".
as
even
my
friend
stated,
there
is
no
requirement
of
magic
words.
what
this
court
said,
what
it
told
congress
in
the
years
leading
up
to
this
statute
is,
you
have
to
express
a
discernible
intent
to
preclude
waiver
of
the
right
to
judicial
remedies.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
not
a
strange
way
at
all
but
a
very
direct
way
in
the
context
here.
remember
in
gilmer,
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
was
a
statute
that
as
amended
in
an
amendment
that
actually
wasn't
before
the
court
in
gilmer
said
you
can't
waive
any
right
under
the
statute.
but
that
then
raises
the
question,
well,
what
do
we
mean
by
rights
under
this
statute.
and
the
court
concluded
there
and
reinforced
in
piette
that
it
interpreted
that
to
mean
substantive
rights.
in
the
absence
of
a
textual
indication,
that
when
congress
used
the
words
"rights"
in
this
statute
it
was
intending
to
protect
the
procedural
right
to
go
to
court.
here
we
have
something
very
different.
congress
creates
a
cause
of
action
which,
as
my
friend
says,
colloquially
someone
could
call
that
a
right
if
they
wanted
to.
but
the
cause
of
action
says
you
can
obtain
this
liability,
the
court
will
determine
that
you
obtain
it
through
an
action.
that
certainly
gives
you
an
entitlement
to
go
to
court.
but
congress
then
goes
further
and
it
denominates
that
one
of
the
rights
under
this
statute,
one
of
only
two
rights
under
this
statute
that
are
so-called.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes,
they
are
definitely
rights,
and--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--i
think
that
if
congress
had
expressly
denominated
something
in
that
statute
as
a
right--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
but
the
question
is
does
any
right
refer
to
both
procedural
and
substantive
rights.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
which
is
what
this
court
held
did
not
in
payette.
when
congress
--
you
know,
it
does
matter
what
words
congress
uses
and
"rights"
is
a
word
that
can
have
a
lot
of
meanings.
this
is
a
statute--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--i
think
if
congress
makes
clear
in
the
statute
that
what
it
means
when
it's
talking
about
rights
includes
procedural
rights
and
then
it
has
a
provision
that
says:
any
right
under
this
statute
is
not
subject
to
waiver,
that
creates
a
very
strong
inference
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
but
in
fact--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--it
is
a
right,
and
when
congress
has
said
--
i
mean
many
of
these
statutes
such
as
title
vii
and
fela
don't
say
that
rights
are
nonwaiverable.
this
statute
is
a
unique
statute
in
its
phrasing.
it
has
a
nonwaiver
provision
applicable
to
any
right,
and
it
has
a
list
of
rights.
that's
pretty
unusual.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well
the
other
thing
that
this
statute
makes
nonwaivable
besides
rights
is
protections,
which
is
a
phrase
that
hasn't
been
tied
to
anything
defined
in
the
statute.
but
i
think
that,
for
example,
all
of
the
prohibited
practices
listed
in
section
1679(b)
which
are
at
pages
4a
to
5a
of
the
red
brief,
those
would
be
nonwaivable.
you
couldn't
waive
your
right
not
to
have
the
credit
repair
organization
make
false
statements
to
you.
you
couldn't
waive
your
right
under
1679
b
(b)
not
to
have
to
make
a
payment
in
advance
to
a
credit
organization.
you
can't
waive
the
right
to
the
disclosures
provided
for
in
1679(c)
or
the
protection
provided
by
those
disclosures.
and
1679(d)
requires
written
contracts
and
specifies
those
terms.
those
would
all
be
subject
to
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
says
you
can't
waive
any
protection
or
any
right
provided
by
the
statute.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
no.
there's
a
--
sort
of
a
pending
disagreement,
perhaps,
over
whether
the
magnus
and
moss
warranty
act
does
have
some
very
specific
language
in
that
statute
about
informal
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
and
the
manner
in
which
that
has
been
interpreted
in
agency
regulations.
so
this
is
really
the
only
statute
that
i'm
aware
of
that
uses
this
formulation.
but
you
remind
me
of
your
earlier
question
which
i
never
got
to
finish
answering
about
the
thousands
of
other
statutes
that
say
specifically
that
you
can't
enforce
arbitration
agreements.
in
fact
there
are
very
few
such
statutes.
there
were
none
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted.
the
first
one
appeared
six
years
later.
the
only
time
that
there
has
been
any
number
of
them
is
in
the
2010
dodd-frank
act
which
came
after
what
i
would
say
is
a
lengthy
period
of
considerable
attention
that
had
been
paid
by
advocates
before
congress
to
the
issue
of
arbitration
that
i
think
led
to
the
desire
to
use
as
sort
of
a
belt
and
suspenders
approach
in
those
statutes.
but
what
we
have
here
in
1996
that
had
never
before
been
a
statute
that
prohibited
the
enforcement
specifically
of
an
arbitration
agreement
in
those
terms.
and
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
there
were
some
proposals,
unenacted
proposals
that
had
been
floated
at
that
time.
but
i
think
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
we
don't
learn
how
congress
does
things
by
looking
at
things
that
it
didn't
do.
and
that's
all
those
unenacted
proposals
were.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
no,
i
think
not,
justice
ginsburg,
and
for
this
reason:
the
court
has
always
differentiated
between
post
dispute
settlements
of
claims
and
pre-dispute
waivers,
and
has
not
considered
agreements
to
settle,
absent
very
special
either
statutory
language
such
as
in
the
adea
which
does
apply
a
waiver
provision
to
some
types
of
settlements,
and
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
where
there's
a
very
specific
policy
reason
for
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
settlements.
but
generally
the
court
has
not
considered
the
settlement
of
a
case
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
bring
a
case.
and
that
primarily
came
in
the
fela
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
briefs.
but
i
think
it
was
significant
that
in
wilko
v.
swan,
where
the
court
said
we
are
going
to
interpret
the
securities
act
not
to
allow
waivers
of
the
right
to
sue,
the
court
said
of
course
this
wouldn't
apply
to
something
that
came
post
dispute.
and
in
mcmahon
v.
rodriguez
de
quijas,
what
the
court
disagreed
with
wilko
v.
swan
about
was
whether
the
right
to
sue
under
that
particular
statute
was
nonwaivable.
but
it
favorably
commented
on
the
notion
that
of
course,
even
if
it
were,
it
wouldn't
bar
a
post
dispute
agreement
to
arbitrate
a
claim
as
a
way
of
settling
an
actually
pending
dispute.
and
that's
why
i
think
that
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
it
would
have
been
acting
against
that
backdrop
and
would
not
have
--
no
one
would
have
thought
that
a
settlement
agreement
is
a
waiver
of
a
right
to
sue.
a
settlement
agreement
is
a
resolution
of
the
right
to
sue.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
contemplates
an
alternative
dispute
mechanism,
because
i
think,
for
example,
that
would
bar
--
when
someone
goes
to
court
to
compel
arbitration,
they
are
enforcing
an
arbitration
agreement
by
bringing
an
enforcement
action.
so
that
would
bar
them
from
doing
that.
so
"any
other
person"
doesn't
necessarily
mean
arbitrators.
but
even
to
the
extent
that
it
comprehends
arbitrators
and
maybe
even
one
might
have
thought
was
principally
applicable
to
them,
you've
got
to
realize
that
this
statute,
what
it
prohibits
is
only
the
waiver
of
the
consumer's
ability
to
arbitrate
her
croa
claim.
it
doesn't
bar
a
credit
repair
organization
from
requiring
a
consumer
to
arbitrate
the
credit
repair
organization's
breach
of
contract
action.
and
in
fact,
most
--
well
over
99
percent
of
the
consumer
arbitrations
that
were
handled
by
the
arbitration
forum
that
was
designated
in
this
contract
were
collection
actions
brought
by
a
company
that
says
this
consumer
owes
me
some
money.
so
that's
kind
of
the
norm.
that's
the
general
run
of
arbitration
cases.
and
if
a
credit
repair
organization
were
to
initiate
an
arbitration
against
a
consumer,
that
wouldn't
violate
the
nonwaiver
provision;
but
if
the
consumer
then
defended
and
said,
wait
a
second,
this
contract
is
void
because
i
never
got
the
right
to
cancel,
the
provision
would
quite
clearly
prevent
the
arbitrator
in
that
circumstance
from
saying,
you
waived
the
right
to
cancel.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
i
think
it's
--
it
would
be
a
remarkably
crabbed
notion
of
having
a
right
to
sue
that
meant
you
could
file
a
complaint
that
was
mandatorily
subject
to
decision
elsewhere.
and
second,
and
this
goes
to
justice--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--certainly.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
but
--
but
all
that
has
been
resolved
in
that
--
in
that
suit
is
not
the
plaintiff's
claim
under
croa,
which
is
what
he
has
a
right
to
sue
on,
all
that's
resolved
is
the
issue
of
whether
he
has
a
contractual
obligation
to
arbitrate
which
he
has
breached
by
going
into
court.
and
--
and
this
goes
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
under
the
faa,
you
can
compel
arbitration
when
someone
has
filed
a
complaint
that
is
in
breach
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
so
they
--
they
don't
actually
have
a
right
to
sue.
you
can't
stop
them
from
going
and
filing
a
complaint,
but
once
they
do,
you
come
in
and
say,
no,
you
have
no
right
to
--
to
proceed
on
the
merits
with
this
claim
in
court.
and
in
fact
that's
--
that's
exactly
what
the
arbitration--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--no,
i
don't
think
you
would
generally
have
that
entitlement
under
any
--
any
rule
of
law
that
is
--
that
is
normally
applicable
in
american
courts.
however,
if
your
--
if
your
arbitration
agreement
provided
for
that,
i'm
afraid
i
can't
point
to
any
decision
that
would
make
it
unenforceable,
much
as
i
would
regret
that
result.
so,
you
know,
i
think
in
a
--
in
a
real
sense
the
consumer
has
no
right
to
--
right
to
sue
merely
because
they
can
run
into
court
and
--
and
then
be
compelled
to
arbitrate.
and
that's
exactly
why
this
court
in
every
one
of
its
decisions
enforcing
arbitration
agreements,
or
not,
has
referred
to
the
arbitration
agreement
as
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
proceed
judicially.
it's
used
that
phrase
over
and
over
again
in
mcmahon,
rodriguez
de
quijas,
mitsubishi,
and
--
and
gilmer
itself.
the
--
the
common
recognition
of
all
those
cases
is
that
the
arbitration
agreement
is
a
waiver
of
the
person's
right
to
proceed
in
court.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
yes.
i
--
you
know,
a
cause
of
action
i
don't
think
would
--
would
do
it
for
us.
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
the
adea
says,
the
section
that
creates
a
judicial
remedy
is
headed
"cause
of
action".
and
so,
you
know,
the
question
again
is
"right"
is
a
word
that
--
that
can
be
used
in
many
senses.
it's
--
it's
a
word
sort
of
like
jurisdiction,
it
gets
thrown
around
loosely.
but
when
congress
says
a
right
is
non-waivable,
it's
referring
to
something
specific,
and
the
question
is
what
is
it
referring
to
in
a
statute
that
uses
the
term
"right"
and
uses
it
to
describe
the
--
the
ability
to
go
to
court.
and
--
and
again,
that
right
to
sue
language
is
important
in
two
ways,
because
it
not
only
specifies
that
the
1679(g)
remedies
are
a
right
for
purpose
of
this
statute,
but
it
says
something
about
the
nature
of
the
right.
it's
a
right
to
sue.
it's
not
just
a
right
to
get
those
damages,
to
get
your
money
back.
and
sue,
as
--
as
i
--
i
think
my
friend
agrees--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--justice
scalia--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
i
--
i'm
not
really
sure
there
are
other
procedural
rights
in
the
statute.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
i
mean,
unless
--
the
right
to
cancel
within
3
days
i
suppose
could
be
called
a
procedure
in
one
sense,
although
it's
--
it's
--
i
think
it
--
it
probably
would
--
would
generally
be
categorized
as
a
substantive
right.
but
as
far
as
procedural
rights
of
the
consumer,
they
are
set
forth
in
1679(g)
and
they
are
the
right
to
bring
an
action
either
on
an
individual
or
class
basis
for
the
damages
and
attorney
fees
specified
in
that
section.
and
that's
what
i
think
is
being
referred
to
as
the
right
to
sue.
now
if
there
were
something
else
in
the
statute
that
one
might
arguably
call
a
right
and
arguably
call
procedural
--
i
mean,
it's
hypothetical
because
i
don't
think
it's
there
--
but
i
--
i
would
not
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
right
if
it
was
not
comprehended
by
"right
to
sue".
because
i
think
what
that
statement
"right
to
sue"
makes
non-waivable
is
the
right
to
sue.
it's
not
just
any
procedural
thing
in
this
statute
that
one
might
loosely
call
a
right.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well--
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
--
let
me
divide
it
up.
if
the
liability
section
said
you
had
a
right
to
sue
and
there
were
no
disclosure
--
disclosure
section
at
all,
i
would
say
that's
--
that's
plenty
good
enough.
if
--
if
the
disclosure
section
says,
you
have
a
right
to
sue
or
to
go
to
arbitration,
i
think
you
would
have
to
then
say
sensibly
what
is
congress
talking
about
when
it's
--
when
it's
referring
to
this,
and
you
would
have
to
read
them
together.
and
i
would
have
a
hard
time
standing
up
here
and
saying
that
a
statute
that
told
people
"right
to
sue
or
arbitrate"
meant
right
to
sue
only
and
foreclosed
arbitration.
and
--
and,
you
know,
i
think
--
i
think
that
really
would
be
a
very
different
matter.
mr.
scott
l.
nelson
well,
when
you
say
"colloquial",
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
take
offense
with
you,
but
i
think
that
that's
selling
it
a
bit
short.
this
--
this
is
a
statute
where
congress
prescribed
a
notice,
prescribed
it
in
statutory
terms,
did
it
so
people
would
have
an
understanding
of
what
their
rights
were,
and
did
it
in
a
way
that
no
reasonable
consumer
would
understand
meant
oh,
this
non-waiverable
right
is
not
really
to
sue
in
the
way
that
i
would
ordinarily
understand
the
word,
and
even
that
way
that
courts
use
it,
but
actually
to
--
to
do
something
else.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
colloquial
in
--
in
a
disparaging
sense.
what
it
is,
is
something
that
is
designed
to
convey
a
clear
meaning,
and
the
clear
meaning
that
it
conveys
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
court.
now,
of
course,
even
a
disclosure
that
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
wouldn't
be
enough
to
get
you
over
the
hump
if
you
didn't
also
have
a
provision
that
made
that
right
non-waiverable.
but
again,
here,
what
you
have
is
both.
and
--
and
in
doing
that,
in
writing
that
statute,
congress
was
doing
exactly
what
the
court
had
told
it,
it
didn't
do
in
gilmer,
it
didn't
do
in
mcmahon,
it
didn't
do
in
mitsubishi.
it
created
a
right
to
a
judicial
remedy
that
is
not
subject
to
waiver.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will--
