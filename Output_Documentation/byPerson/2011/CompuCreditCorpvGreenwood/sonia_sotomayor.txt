justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
statute
didn't
have
as
this
one
has
a
disclosure
requirement
that
says
you
have
a
right
to
sue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
it's
a
meaningful
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
mean
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
the
minute
one
of
these
organizations
asks
someone
to
sign
an
arbitration
clause?
a
$1,000
penalty
for
the
mere
asking?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
doesn't
that
reading,
however,
make
suspect
your
claim
that
congress
would
have
intended
--
without
any
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
--
and
our
case
law
has
said
you
have
to
read
the
intent
to
bar
arbitration
both
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
context,
and
its
history.
i
just
don't
see
any
history
here
that
supports
your
reading.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
actually,
mr.
mcconnell,
can
we
go
to
the
issue
of
class
action?
if
we
buy
your
argument
that
procedural
and
substantive
rights
are
different,
is
it
your
position
that
you
could
seek
a
waiver
of
the
class
action
even
though
this
statute
expressly
contemplates
class
actions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
answer
to
me
is
that
is
waiverable.
that
is
not
a
right
contemplated
by
the
right
to
sue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
to
meet--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
--
you
have
to
meet
the
prerequisites
of
a
class
action
before
you
are
entitled
to
seek
one.
but
your
position
is
that's
not
a
protected
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
unless
--
unless
we
read
the
disclosure
requirement
of
a
right
to
sue
to
mean
that
you
are
entitled
to
bring
your
action
in
court,
with
whatever
protections,
procedural
and
substantive
protections
that
entails.
