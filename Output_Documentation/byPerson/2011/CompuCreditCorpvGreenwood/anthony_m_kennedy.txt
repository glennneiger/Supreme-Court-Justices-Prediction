justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
standard
arbitration
agreement,
if
smith
and
jones
agree
to
arbitrate
and
jones
then
brings
suit
in
court,
and
that
action
is
then
stayed
pending
arbitration,
has
there
been
a
breach
of
the
arbitration
agreement
simply
by
bringing
the
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
doesn't
that
happen
rather
often?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
of
course
the
suits
are
brought
after
arbitration
to
enforce
the
arbitration
award.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy

you
get

can
you
get
damages
in
the
arbitration
for
the
cost
of
attorney's
fees
to
go
to
the
court
to
say
that
you
had
to
go
to
the
arbitration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
case
were
reversed.
the
liability
section
says
you
have
a
right
to
sue,
and
the
disclosure
section
says
you
have
a
right
to
sue
and
go
to
arbitration.
what
result
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
--
well,
i
will
let
you
answer.
