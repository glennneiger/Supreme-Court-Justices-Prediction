suppose
it
said
something
different,
mr.
mcconnell.
suppose
the
disclosure
provision
didn't
exist
at
all
but
that
instead
of
the
liability
provision
you
had
a
provision
that
simply
said:
any
person
injured
by
a
violation
of
this
act
will
have
a
right
of
action
or
will
have
a
right
to
sue
under
this
statute.
and
then
you
had
the
waiver
provision
that
you
have
in
this
statute.
is
that
enough?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mcconnell,
the
cases
that
you
cite
in
support
of
your
position
rest
on
a
distinction
between
procedural
rights
and
substantive
rights,
which
you
invoke
here.
but
where
does
that
distinction
itself
come
from?
because,
it
seems
very
atextual
in
nature,
that
distinction,
which
does
appear
in
the
cases.
but
when
congress
talks
about
rights,
why
should
we
think
of
rights
as
limited
to
substantive
rights
rather
than
also
procedural
rights?
justice
elena
kagan
except
if
congress
indicates
otherwise
and--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
i
guess
the
problem
here
is
that
there
is
this
language
in
this
disclosure
provision
which
is
meant,
you
know,
truly
to
inform
consumers
about
--
about
their
rights
and
about
where
they
are
going
to
end
up
resolving
their
disputes,
and
it
says
you
have
a
right
to
sue,
and
you
are
asking
us
essentially
to
read
that
language
as:
you
have
a
right
to
bring
a
claim
in
court,
but
it's
probably
going
to
end
up
in
arbitration
because
of
the
nature
of
your
form
contract.
and
that
seems
a
very
different
kind
of
statement
to
consumers.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
nelson,
but
your
friend
mr.
mcconnell
says
quite
rightly
that
the
rules
in
this
area
have
been
fairly
clear,
that
congress
knew
it
had
to
make
especially
clear
that
it
wanted
to
void
arbitration
agreements.
so
if
that's
the
case,
why
didn't
congress
do
what
it
has
the
done
in
a
thousand
other
statutes
--
or
maybe
that's
an
overstatement,
but
a
number
of
other
statutes
--
which
is
to
say
so?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
know,
mr.
nelson,
whether
this
statute
is
unique
in
this
sense:
do
you
know
of
any
other
statute
that
arguably
voids
arbitration
agreements
without
saying
that
they
are
voiding
--
that
it's
voiding
an
arbitration
agreement?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
nelson,
you
just
said
if
the
liability
section
said
you
have
a
right
to
sue
that's
okay,
but
if
it
says
you
have
a
cause
of
action
that's
not
okay.
but
the
right
to
sue
is
really
just
a
colloquial
way
of
expressing
the
first,
so
why
should
we
draw
the
line
between
those
two
things?
