wood
v.

ms.
lord.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what
we
said
in
day,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
keep
going.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
domenico.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we
will
hear
from
ms.
sherry
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
that
if
the
court
says,
you
know,
you
have
a
good
state
of
limitations
defense,
you
would
clearly
win
on
that.
but
i'm
going
to
ignore
it,
even
though
you
didn't
raise
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
not
to
accept
a
valid,
evident
statute
of
limitations
defense
on
the
ground
that
the
state
didn't
raise
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
lord,
you
have
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-9995,
wood
versus
milyard.
