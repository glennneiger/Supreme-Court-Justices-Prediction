well,
are
there
a
lot
of
cases
raising,
you
know,
the
ambiguity
that
exists
in
this
case?
i
mean,
if
you
tell
me
that's
all
this
case
is
about
i
think
we
ought
to
dismiss
it,
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted.
we
don't
sit
here
to
decide
whether
when
the
government
says,
you
know,
we
do
not
concede
it
but
we
are
not
arguing
it,
or
whatever
the
language
was,
we
don't
sit
to
decide
factual
questions
like
that
that
come
up
in
a
particular
case.
i
thought
we
took
this
case
to
decide
the
more
significant
issue,
on
which
there
is
a
division
in
the
lower
courts,
as
to
whether
there
is,
as
you
say,
power
of
the
court
to
disregard
the
fact
that
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
has
not
been
raised.
you
all
agree
it
wasn't
raised.
now,
whether
it
was
forfeited
or
not
is
another
question.
if
that's
all
you
want
us
to
decide,
i
don't
want
to
decide
that.
justice

scalia
ms.
lord,
an
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
15
states
contends
that
the
civil
--
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
not
what
should
be
consulted
here,
because
they
govern
only
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
inconsistent
with
habeas
rules,
and
asserts
that
the
--
the
habeas
rules
should
rather
apply,
and
that
they
--
that
they
cut
against
your
case.
do
you
have
a
response
to
that?
was
it
--
was
it
in
your
reply
brief
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
the
state
adhere
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
kept
its
word,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
you
didn't
abandon
the
right.
isn't
that
your
position,
you
did
not
abandon
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
gave
up
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
sunk
costs,
aren't
they,
mr.
domenico?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
water
over
the
dam
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
will
then
have
to
repeat
the
district
court's
excursus
into
the
merits,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
gotten
mad
at
the
fact
that
district
court
was
compelled
to
go
through
the
merits,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
that
reason
could
have
denied
it.
but
it
didn't
get
mad,
i
guess.
i
don't
know
why.
