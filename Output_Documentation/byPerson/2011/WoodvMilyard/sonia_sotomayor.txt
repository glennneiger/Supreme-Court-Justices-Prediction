justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
we
asked
for
two
questions
presented.
the
first
was:
do
court
of
appeals
have
the
power
sua
sponte
to
raise
issues?
and
in
your
reply
brief
you
appear
to
say,
yes,
they
do
in
some
circumstances.
so
are
you
conceding
that
that
power
exists
or
that
there
is
no
power
whatsoever?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
a
question
of
power
or
a
question
of
exercise
of
discretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
seems
sort
of
strange.
both
rely
on
a
factual
situation.
either
you
can
do
something
or
you
can't.
that's
power.
if
you
can
do
it
sometimes,
that's
still
power,
and
then
the
question
is
did
you
do
it
when
you
couldn't
do
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
all
this
fight
is
about
is
whether
there
was
a
deliberate
waiver
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
opposed
to
power?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
only
the
opportunity
or
when
it
acknowledges
--
in
day
we
faulted
the
district
court
for
not
telling
the
state
essentially,
which
--
not
telling
the
state
that
it
had
a
potential
statute
of
limitations
defense.
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
state
had
just
been
silent
about
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
and
not
raised
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
have
power?
or
is
it
your
position
that
because
they
knew
they
had
the
defense
and
didn't
raise
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
power
to
sua
sponte
raise
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not
answering
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
power
sua
sponte
to
raise
it
if
the
state
--
neither
the
court
or
the
state
addressed
the
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
it
doesn't
have
the
power
if
the
issue
has
been
raised?
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
confused.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it
before
the
party
did,
that
that's
worse
than
a
party
raising
it
first.
is
that
your
position?
that
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
more
power
after
a
party
who
has
forfeited
below
or
waived
below
now
tries
to
come
up
on
appeal
and
assert
a
defense
that
they
didn't
assert
below?
now
the
court
of
appeals
has
more
power?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
those
arguments
were
rejected
in
granberry
and
day.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
should
they
win
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
why
should
we
be
penalizing
the
state
for
trying
to
simplify
an
action,
and
make
it
move
more
expeditiously?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that,
using
your
own
words
in
your
brief,
that
a
waiver
is
the
intentional
abandonment
of
a
known
right?
i
think
you're
equating
intentional
abandonment
of
a
known
right
to
be:
i
have
to
admit
i
could
win
and
i'm
giving
up
that
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
what
you're
saying,
intent,
deliberate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
knew
you
had
a
defense
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
thought,
because
you
conceded,
that
you
weren't
conceding
that
it
was
untimely.
so
you
were
conceding
you
thought
it
was
untimely.
and
despite
admitting
that
you
knew
you
had
a
defense,
that
you
knew
it
could
win,
you
were
choosing
not
to
assert
it.
so
tell
me
why
that's
not
either
an
intentional
waiver,
a
deliberate
waiver
or
an
abandonment
of
a
known
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
were
protecting
the
court's
right
to
do
whatever
it
wanted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
an
appellate
court,
when
there
has
been
an
intentional
abandonment
of
a
known
right,
to
sua
sponte
raise
that
defense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
the
new
case
law
is
what
i
said.
when
you
say,
i
won't
raise
this
defense;
i
waive
it,
everything
you
said
except
saying
i
don't
admit
it,
today,
before
this
circuit
court
abuses
its
discretion,
you
also
have
to
say:
i
am
waiving
the
right
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
this
sua
sponte.
that's
--
you
want
that
to
be
what
you
need
to
do
for
us
to
find
a
waiver.
