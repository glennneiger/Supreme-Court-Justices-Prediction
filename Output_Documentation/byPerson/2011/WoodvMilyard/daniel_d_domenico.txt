mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
contrast
to
the
new
and
fairly
complicated
set
of
doctrines
my
friend
asked
the
court
to
adopt
today,
this
court
can
resolve
this
case
by
applying
two
straightforward
longstanding
rules.
first,
in
granberry
v.
greer,
the
court
recognized
that
courts
are
not
bound
by
a
state's
failure
to
properly
argue
and
preserve
a
procedural
bar
to
a
habeas
claim;
and
second,
to
the
extent
there
is
an
exception
to
that
rule
for
deliberate
waivers,
the
court
should
apply
the
common
rule
that
a
waiver
must
be
unequivocal.
by
applying
--
please.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
on
the
--
on
the
second
question?
well,
that's
a
common
rule.
it's
from
statutory
rights
such
as
in
olano--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--college
savings
bank
is
one,
probably
the
clearest
case.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
unequivocal
is
a
common
--
for
waiver
of
every--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--justice
breyer,
what
the
state
was
doing
here
was
not
strategically
trying
to--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--justice
breyer,
the
--
the
court
has
been
clear
that
a
state's
failure
--
normally,
that's
true.
the
normal
rule
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
is
a
forfeiture
of
that
sort,
failure
to
raise
an
argument,
is
deemed
essentially
to
be
a
waiver
under
those
definitions.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
justice
ginsburg,
there
was
an
element
of
mistake,
of
negligence,
as
you
say.
but
it
also
was--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
what
the
state
was
trying
to
do,
i
think,
is
slightly
different
than
would
make
sense
in
any
other
context.
because
of
the
special
procedures
we
are
under
in
a
habeas,
a
pre-answer
response,
what
we
are
telling
the
court
was:
we
will
not
assert
this
argument
unless
there
is
further
inquiry
from
the
court.
now,
normally
in
court
there
would
be--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--that
is--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--i
don't
think
that's
quite
an
accurate
characterization
of
what
the
state--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--well,
the
black's
law
dictionary,
of
course,
applies
the
usual
rule.
this
court
has
made
clear
in
granberry
and
day
that
the
usual
rule
that
a
forfeiture
of
a
legal
right
means
that
it's
not
to
be
brought
up
again,
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
bind
the
court's
hand.
granberry
and
day
make
that
quite
clear.
what
happened
in
granberry
would
have
been
a
forfeiture.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
it's
unequivocal
that
we
were
not
going
to
press
it
again,
though
i
think
the
implication
--
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
have
raised
it
initially.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
include
this
caveat
about
refusing
to
concede,
if
that
was
all
we
were
trying
to
say.
there
are
easy
ways
for
a
state
to
take
the
issue
off
the
table.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
well,
in
that
case--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--well
you
have
to
know
what
it
is
you
are
giving
up.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
sure.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
the
--
what
we
were
abandoning
to
the
extent
we
were
abandoning
--
abandoning
anything,
it
was
our
ability
to
force
the
court
to
address
the
issue.
in
any
other
context
i
agree
that
maybe
--
there
may
be
a
distinction
with
no
difference.
but
in
this
case
because
there
is
discrete--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--there
was
a
screening
--
there
was
a
screening
function.
we
were
raising
the
issue
precisely
to
put
it
on
the
court's
table
for
consideration.
in
a
habeas--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--well,
we
did
not
take
off
the
table
the
court's
right
to
consider
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
we
did
not
abandon.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
i
think
it's
confusion
between
what
we
are
calling
a
right
or
the
issue
or
the
defense.
we,
that's
right,
gave
up
our
right
in
the
district
court,
unless
asked,
to
argue
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
well,
i
think
in
your
typical
case
it
doesn't
matter
because
forfeitures
generally
are
deemed
to
be
waivers,
i
think,
in
your
typical
case.
that's
not
true
under
granberry
and
day.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
a
forfeiture
is
different
than
a
deliberate
waiver.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
i
think
it's
better
understood
as
a
forfeiture.
simply
you're
not
going
to
argue
the
issue,
but
the
issue
doesn't
necessarily
need
to
be
taken
off
the--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--well,
if
the
court
looks
at
the
--
where
this
deliberate
waiver
exception
to
the
granberry
and
day
rule
comes
from,
it
comes
from
day
and
the
concern
there
is
that
with
the
court
overriding
a
state's
decision
to
waive,
to
take
the
issue
off
the
table.
there
are
examples
of
states
doing
that.
and
when
they
do
it
they
are
clear
about
it
and
you
can
tell
when
it
would
be
overridden.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
we
failed
in
our
--
in
our
duty
and
our
obligation
to
protect
the
district
court
from
having
to
engage
in
what
had
we
properly
argued
this
would
have
been
unnecessary.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
they
are,
justice--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--that's
exactly
right.
we
have
already
spent
that
time.
the
question
now
is
if,
if
mr.
wood
prevails
now,
the
court
of
appeals
will
have
to
proceed
to
resolving
the
case
on
the
merits.
instead
in
this
case
they
applied
the
very
common
principle
that
a
court
of
appeals
will
affirm
for
any
basis
supported
by
the
record.
in
order
precisely
to
avoid
--
that
happens
fairly
often.
they
avoid
having
to
address
a
constitutional
problem.
they
save
having
to
engage
in
those
efforts
again.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
absolutely.
we
recognize
that
this
is
in
that
middle
ground
where
the
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
do
this.
had
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
do
it,
we
wouldn't
be
here
demanding
that
they
be
forced
to
consider
this
issue.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
absolutely.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
well,
it
didn't
get
mad
partly,
i
think,
perhaps
because
mr.
wood
never
argued
that
the
issue
was
forfeited
or
waived
at
all
until
after,
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
already
resolved
the
question.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
absolutely.
i
do
not
think
that
the
district
court
was
prohibited
from
considering
it.
the
only
reason
for
us
to
have
raised
this
sort
of
skeletal
outline
of
the
argument
was
precisely
so
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
it.
remember,
this
was
raised
initially
in
the
pre-answer
response
stage
where
the
--
which
is
specifically
part
of
the
district
court's
preliminary
consideration
of
the
issue.
so
it
was
certainly
ex
ante
quite
possible
that
the
response
of
the
district
court
would
not
be
to
simply
ignore
the
issue
as
it
did
but
to
either
ask
for
additional
briefing,
as
happens
with
some
regularity,
to
issue
a
show-cause
order
as
it
had
already
done,
or
perhaps
to
dismiss
the
case
again
as
it
had
already
done
so.
so
the
issue
was
not
off
the
table.
the
district
court
very
much
could
have
addressed
the
question.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
i
think
that's
a
harder
case.
the
lead
up
to
that,
i
think,
undermines
the,
at
least,
the
unequivocal
nature
of
that
statement
because
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
have
laid
out
the
potential
argument
if
what
we
were
really
trying
to
do
was
waive
the,
waive
the
entire
issue
as
day
uses
that,
that
language.
if,
if
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
do,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
do
that
either.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
i
don't
think
you
need
to
say
that.
i
don't
think
there
necessarily
need
to
be
any
magic
words
at
all,
but
it
needs
to
be
unequivocal
and
clear,
not
ambiguous
language
that
we
are
going
to
spend
an
hour
here
today
trying
to
debate
what
it
was
that
we
meant.
that's
the
only
rule
we
are
asking
for
today.
and
the
contrary
rule
really
provides
some
perverse
incentives
to
states.
i
mean,
here
the
state
was
trying
to
be
candid
with
the
court.
it
discovered
this
1995
motion
on
its
own.
mr.
wood
had
never
mentioned
it
in
his
filings.
he
had
already
briefed
the
timeliness
issue
twice
in
the
district
court
without
mentioning
it,
let
alone
raising
it
at
any
of
his
petitions.
the
state
found
this
and
tried
to
be
candid,
that
we
weren't
entirely
clear
about
how
the
argument
played
out,
the
alternative
is
that
states
will
be
forced
into
something
more
than
scorched
earth,
throw
everything
at
the
court,
see
what
sticks,
and
that's
not
in
anybody's
interest,
let
alone
the
federal
court's
or
habeas
petitioners.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
justice
ginsburg,
again,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
accurate
to
say
that
we
told
the
district
court
not
to
address
the
issue.
we
told
the
district
court
there
was
an
issue
that
we
were
going
to
refrain
from
presenting
our
full
argument
on
it.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
well,
i
disa
--
i
do
think
we
qualified
it.
the
only
reason
to
include
the
language
about
not
conceding
was
to
qualify
that.
the
only
reason
to
lay
out
the
argument
was
to
make
sure
that
the
court
was
able
to
consider
it
in
its
screening
procedures
and--
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
--i
don't
think
it
is,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
d.
domenico
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
for
us
to
have
been
concerned
about
how,
if
we
had
simply
stated
we
are
not
challenging
it,
there
would
have
been
no
concern
about
this
affecting
any
other
case
whatsoever.
the
only
case
in
which
to
be
concerned
that
what
we
said
would
be
misconstrued
as
a
waiver
was
this
case.
