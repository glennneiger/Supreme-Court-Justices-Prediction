ms.
lord,
could
i
ask
you
about
the
first
question
presented?
justice
elena
kagan
as
i
understand
the
opposing
argument,
it
goes
sort
of
like
this.
it
says:
in
day
we
said
it's
fine
to
do
this
in
the
district
court;
even
if
the
party
hasn't
raised
it,
the
court
can
raise
it
on
this
exact
issue.
in
granberry
we
said
with
respect
to
a
different
issue
that
the
appellate
court
could
raise
it;
and
in
day
we
said
that
those
two
issues
were
really
the
same.
so
that
seems
sort
of
like
a
logical
argument
that
just
gets
you
to
a
place
where
you
lose
on
the
first
question,
unless
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
between
a
court
raising
a
question
sua
sponte
and
a
court
allowing
a
party
to
raise
it
later
than
the
party
ought
to
have
raised
it.
are
you
relying
on
that
distinction,
or
are
you
questioning
the
logic
of
the
basic
argument
that
granberry
and
day
decided
this?
justice
elena
kagan
but
didn't
day
say
that
those
two
issues
were
functionally
identical
for
this
purpose?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
domenico,
you're
saying
something
considerably
more.
you're
saying
that
when
a
state
gets
up
after
inquiry
by
the
district
court,
when
a
state
gets
up
and
says,
we
do
not
want
to
press
this
argument,
now
we
are
not
saying
that
the
argument
is
wrong,
because
after
all,
we
are
a
repeat
player
and
we
are
going
to
hear
that
argument
again.
and
we
are
not
saying
that
argument
is
wrong,
but
in
this
case
we
do
not
want
to
press
that
argument.
that's
equivocal
--
that's
unequivocal
to
me.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
domenico,
do
i
understand
your
argument
correctly
to
think
that
if
you
had
not
said,
or
if
the
lawyer
for
the
state
had
not
we
are
not
conceding,
if
all
that
the
lawyer
for
the
state
had
said
is,
we
are
not
challenging
this,
your
honor,
would
that
count
as
a
deliberate
waiver
under
day?
justice
elena
kagan
if
this
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
isn't
the
concession
language
really
going
to
a
different
point?
the
concession
language
is
going
to
the
point
of
why
it
is
that
you're
not
raising
it,
that
you're
not
challenging
it.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sherry,
there
is
one
difference,
is
you
put
granberry
and
day
together,
ti
gets
you
most
of
the
way
there.
the
one
difference
is
that
here
there
was
sua
sponte
decision
by
the
court;
whereas,
in
even
the
combination
of
granberry
and
day,
it
was
a
party
that
raised
it,
although
the
party
raised
it
late.
so
why
should
that
difference
not
matter?
if
you
think
that
party
presentation
has
some
consequence
in
this
area,
you
might
think
that
that
difference
does
matter;
that
once
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
even
then
the
party
doesn't
raise
it,
sort
of
enough
is
enough.
justice
elena
kagan
but
at
the
time
trial
level--
justice
elena
kagan
--of
course,
the
habeas
court
has
a
significant
screening
function.
