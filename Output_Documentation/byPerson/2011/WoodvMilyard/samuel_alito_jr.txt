justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
sounds
like
what
you're
arguing
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
in
viewing
this
as
a
plain
forfeiture,
which
you've
just
said
would
permit
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
the
issue
sua
sponte,
instead
of
a
deliberate
waiver.
is
that
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
put
it
in
the
wrong
--
they
abused
their
discretion
by
putting
it
in
the
wrong
box.
they
didn't
put
it
in
the
forfeiture
box;
they
put
it
in
the
deliberate
waiver
box.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
troubles
me
about
your
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion.
is
it
correct
that
you
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
the
court
of
appeals'
lack
of
authority
to
raise
this
sua
sponte
until
rehearing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
abused
its
discretion
by
failing
to
rule
in
your
favor
on
an
argument
that
you
didn't
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
rule
of
civil
procedure
applies
here?
you're
talking
about
appellate
procedure
here.
is
there
a
rule
of
appellate
procedure
that
governs
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
refer
to
what
happens
in
the
district
court,
and
day
dealt
with
that.
now
you're
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
rule
is
there
that
addresses
the
situation
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
made
an
argument
in
your
brief
that
i
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
follow,
so
maybe
you
can
explain
it.
you
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
state's
position
on
timeliness
in
district
court
somehow
induced
your
client
to
dismiss
the
claims
that
were
arguably
not
exhausted.
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
understand
why
the
--
why
your
client's
strategy
as
to
whether
he
wanted
to
dismiss
those
claims
are
not
--
would
be
affected
by
the
state's
position
on
timeliness.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
why
--
you
have
two
situations.
one
situation,
the
state's
raising
timeliness.
so
he
says:
okay,
they're
raising
timeliness;
i'm
not
going
to
dismiss
my
--
the
claims
that
they
say
are
not
exhausted.
the
other
situation,
they
--
they
don't
say
anything
about
timeliness,
and
he
says:
now
i'm
going
to
dismiss
the
claims
that
are
--
that
they
say
are
unexhausted.
i
don't
understand
the
connection.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
why
that's
a
benefit
to
him.
but
what
is
the
connection
between
that
and
the
dismissal
of
the
unexhausted
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
screening
function
that
the
--
the
district
court
performs
in
the
habeas
case
inconsistent
with
the
traditional
rule
about
raising
affirmative
defenses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example
of
a
regular
civil
case.
there
are
two
defendants
and
the
same
claim
against
two
defendants.
one
defendant
files
an
answer
and
raises
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
the
other
one
doesn't.
the
judge
asks
the
second
defendant,
are
you
going
to
amend
your
complaint,
and
the
defendant
says
no.
now
is
that
a
waiver
or
is
that
a
forfeiture?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
the
terminology
we
are
using
wouldn't
that
be
a
forfeiture?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
say
that
the
position
that
the
state
took
in
the
district
court
permitted
the
district
court
from
considering
the
time
limits
issue?
if
it
wasn't
a
deliberate
waiver,
then
the
district
court
under
day
wasn't
prohibited
from
deciding
the
case
untimely.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
may
have
forgotten
the
procedural
complications
of
this
case,
but
here,
did
the
state
have
any
opportunity
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
the
timeliness
issue
prior
to
the
time
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
certificate
of
appealability?
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
issued
a
certificate
of
appealability
on
the
issue
of
timeliness,
would
the
issue
have
come
up
at
all?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
a
state
knows
that
it
has
a
potential
statute
of
limitations
defense
and
says
nothing,
is
that
a
forfeiture
or
a
waiver?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
simply
saying
nothing
can
be
a
waiver,
in
your
view.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
not,
then
what
is
the
difference
between
saying
nothing,
knowing
that
you
have
a
defense
and
saying
we're
not
challenging
but
we're
not
conceding?
what
is
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
just
ask
it
one
more
way
and
then
i'll--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--back
in
the
office,
they're
considering
--
in
the
state's
office,
they're
considering
what
they're
going
to
do.
and
they
say
well,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we're
not
going
to
challenge
it,
but
we're
not
going
to
concede
it.
and
therefore,
they
say
nothing.
