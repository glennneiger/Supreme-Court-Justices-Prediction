ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decisions
in
granberry
and
day
answer
the
first
question
presented.
we
think
petitioner
can
no
longer
contests
that,
and
the
court
can
simply
decide
the
first
question
presented
on
that
basis
and
reaffirm
what
it
said
in
granberry.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
number
one,
i
think
it's
significant
that
day
itself
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
raised
it,
raised
it
on
its--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--at
the
trial
level--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--no,
that's
certainly
true.
i
think
the
procedural
default
cases
are
another
good
example
this
court
in
day
cited,
a
number
of
them,
a
number
of
them
of
which
were
cases
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
raising
the
issue
sua
sponte.
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
we
cite
a
number
of
procedural
default
cases.
a
lot
of
them
come
up
in
the
sua
sponte
context.
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
made
a
distinction
between
the
two.
i
think
they
certainly
implicate
different
concerns.
for
example,
to
the
extent
this
court
has
been
worried
about
sandbagging
or
strategic
behavior,
i
think
that's
largely
absent
in
circumstances
where
the
court
is
raising
on
its
own
motions
as
opposed
to
the
party
belatedly
raising
the
issue
on
appeal.
so
i
do
think
if
you
look
at
granberry,
you
look
at
day,
you
look
at
gaspari,
you
look
at
schiro,
and
you
look
at
the
procedural
default
cases,
i
think
that
really
does
resolve
the
first
question
presented.
and
again,
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
argues
otherwise
at
this
point.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
state
did
have
an
opportunity
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
after
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
was
filed,
the
court
did
order
the
state
to
file
a
response,
and
the
state
didn't
argue
timeliness
in
that
response.
but
when
the
court
of
appeals
did
ask
for
briefing
on
this
issue
in
the
certificate
of
appealability
process,
the
state,
of
course,
did
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
there,
and
it
did
argue
that
the
petition
was
untimely,
and
it
strongly
argued
that.
and
so,
i
guess,
turning
to
the
second
question
presented
of
deliberate
waiver,
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
deliberate
waiver
in
the
way
that
day
spoke
about
that
term
here
for
two
primary
reasons.
number
one
when
day
spoke
of
deliberate
waiver,
it
spoke
of
overriding
a
state's
deliberate
waiver,
and
i
think
if
you
look,
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
timeliness
question,
there
is
no
way
to
look
at
that
as
the
state
--
as
the
court,
rather
actually
overriding
the
state's
deliberate
waiver.
at
that
point
the
state
had
argued
that
the
petition
was
untimely.
petitioner
never
argued
that
the
court
shouldn't
decide
the
issue,
never
argued
that
that
--
that
the
state
had
waived
that
issue
below.
and
i
think
at
that
time
it's
really
difficult
to
characterize
that
as
overriding
the
state's
deliberate
waiver.
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
in
the
district
court--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
--
i
think
that
certainly
is
true,
but
i
think
it's
important
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
should
be
treated
as
a
deliberate
waiver
to
look
at
what
the
consequences
of
treating
it
as
such
would
be.
the
consequences
of
treating
it
as
a
deliberate
waiver
under
the
language
day
is
that
the
court's
hands
would
be
bound;
the
court
would
be
unable
to
decide
the
timeliness
question.
and
it's
not
just
the
court
of
appeals;
the
district
court
as
well.
so
if
this
were
a
clear
deliberate
waiver
in
district
court
when
the
state
filed
its
preanswer
response,
the
district
court
would
have
been
without
any
authority
to
consider--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--well--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--because
it's
not
just
about
the
state.
because
it's
--
because
of
the
institutional
interests
that
are
at
stake.
and
that's
why
granberry
and
schiro
and
caspari
and
day
allowed
there
to
be
consideration
of
these
issues
despite
forfeiture.
it's
because
of
the
institutional
issues.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
despite
forfeiture,
right.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
--
and
that's
the
very
question
here,
whether
it
should
be
treated
like
forfeiture
or
whether
it
would
be
treated
like
waiver.
and
the
reason
why
i
think
it
would
be
a
bad
result
to
treat
it
as
waiver
here
and
why
it
would
be
bad
to
have
bound
the
district
court's
hands
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
what
happened
here,
the
district
court
on
its
own
motion
initially
dismissed
this
as
untimely.
it
came
back
and
it
went
to
the
state
and
said,
you
know,
i
need
more
information.
and
the
state
provided
that
additional
information.
it
would
be
a
somewhat
odd
system
for
when
the
district
court
now
had
this
information
in
front
of
it,
now
knew
about
the
1995
motion,
for
it
not
to
have
been
able
to
do
anything
further
with
respect
to
timeliness
on
--
on
that
point.
the
fact
that
the
state
for
whatever
reason
decided
to
press
other
issues
shouldn't
bind
the
district
court's
hands
except
in
the
rarest
of
circumstances.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
--
and
to
be
clear,
i
think
that's
certainly
a
factor
that
the
courts
can
and
do
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
exercise
their
discretion
to
consider
a
timeliness
issue.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
court
should
lose
any
discretion
to
consider
that
issue.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
that's
--
that's
what
the
court
said
in
day.
and
i
guess
the
question
is
--
is
how
strictly
that
should
be
construed.
and
our
position
would
be
that
it
should
be
strictly
construed
because
of
the
consequences
of
that
waiver.
and
again,
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
court
in
day
did
talk
about
overriding
a
state's
deliberate
waiver.
in
the
dissent,
justice
scalia,
you
mentioned
the
example
of
a
court
amending
a
party's
pleading
over
that
party's
objections.
and
i
think
that
really
is
the
narrow
circumstance
in
which
the
waiver
rule
should
operate.
it's
not
that
the
state's
behavior
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
before
the
court
as
to
whether
the
court
should
exercise
its
discretion;
it's
actually
quite
relevant,
and
it's
something
that
courts
of
appeals
can
and
do
look
at.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
courts
lack
any
authority
to
consider
a
limitations
defense
or
other
procedural
defense--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
under
--
under
day,
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
deliberate
waiver,
and
i
think
under
day,
the
court
said
quite
plainly
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
those
circumstances.
and
i
think
there
are
a
limited
number
of
circumstances
where
--
where
that
makes
sense,
and
i
think
the
court
has
seen
examples
of
that
as
recently
as
this
term,
for
example.
the
court
denied
cert
in
the
case
buck
v.
thaler
earlier
this
term,
where
a
predecessor
case
that
is
an
example
of
the
state
expressly
waiving
a
procedural
default
defense
because
it
wanted
the
court
to
reach
the
merits.
in
that
case,
the
state
said
quite
plainly
--
in
the
predecessor
case,
i
should
say
--
the
state
said
quite
plainly
because
the
use
of
race
in
the
punishment
phase
seriously
undermined
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
the
director
expressly
waives
any
procedural
bar
with
respect
to
that
claim.
now,
that
is
the
quintessential
deliberate
waiver.
and
it
took
it
off
table,
unlike
what
happened
in
this
case.
