justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
what
the
--
swords
are
crossed
over
here
because
you
say
this
is
a
deliberate
waiver
and
the
government
says
no,
it's
--
it's
a
forfeiture,
and
forfeiture
--
if
it's
forfeiture,
then
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretion
to
take
it
up.
if
it's
a
waiver
then
day
makes
clear.
so
it's
a
question
of
which
box
this
case
fits
into,
is
it
forfeiture
or
is
it
waiver.
and
your
position
is
it's
waiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
had
two
opportunities
at
least
to
make
the
argument
based
on
the
original
post-conviction
motion,
the
1995
post-conviction
motion.
you
did
not
raise
that.
you
were
silent
twice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
i'm
confused
because
i
thought
that
there
was
--
it
was
conceded
that
the
question
was
asked
did
you
file
another
post-conviction
motion;
answer:
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
wasn't
failure
to
raise
an
argument;
this
was
representing
to
the
court:
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness.
that
was
the
representation
made
to
the
court.
that
was
not
negligent
oversight
in
not
raising
the
question.
it
was
an
affirmative
representation
to
the
court
that,
although
we
might
have
done
it,
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
consequence
of
that
was
the
district
court
then
had
to
deal
with
the
case
on
the
merits,
had
to
take
up
the
two
exhausted
claims
and
rule
on
them,
after
having
told
the
district
court
you
don't
need
--
we
are
not
raising
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness.
so
you
put
the
district
court
to
the
necessity
of
deciding
the
case
on
the
merits.
it
does.
it
takes
up
the
two
unexhausted
claims
and
deals
with
them
on
the
merits.
in
day,
absolutely
nothing
transpired
between
the
state
saying
the
claim
was
timely
and
the
magistrate's
detection
of
the
computation
error.
the
district
court
wasn't
put
to
what
was
unnecessary
work.
it
was
the
consequence
of
saying
we
will
challenge
it,
force
the
district
judge
to
deal
with
it
on
the
merits.
in
day,
the
counsel
didn't
bring
up
the
question
because
counsel
thought
that
it
was
timely.
he
had
miscalculated
and
made
a
mathematical
error.
and
the
judge
then
said:
i
see
that
the
number
of
days
that's
required
by
statute,
they
have
run.
and
as
day
pointed
out,
at
that
point
a
trial
judge
could
have
said:
now,
you
know
you
miscalculated;
wouldn't
you
like
to
amend
your
complaint
and
put
in
a
defense.
so
the
two
cases,
the
two
situations
are
so
different.
the
district
judge
wasn't
--
nobody
was
made
to
do
anything
extra.
but
in
here,
because
the
attorney
said
we
won't
challenge
it,
the
district
judge
had
to
deal
with
the
case
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
something
about
the
principle
of
party
presentation,
the
party
raises
the
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
court
of
review,
not
first
view.
here
in
day,
the,
the
lawyer
did
not
know
that
he
had
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
that
--
did
not
know
it
was
miscalculated
at
the
time.
here
the
state
knew
very
well
that
it
did
have
a
statute
of
limitations
argument,
but
it
says:
we
are
not
challenging
it.
and
then
the
ordinary
thing
is
that
a
court
of
appeals
reviews
decisions
of
the
district
court;
doesn't
decide
questions
in
the
first
instance.
but
here
you
are
saying
the
attorney
can
tell
district
judge:
don't
decide;
just
go
on
to
the
merits.
then
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
supposed
to
be
reviewing
what
the
district
court
does,
instead
deals
with
that
question
in
the
first
instance.
this
seems
like
an
odd
inversion
of
the
role
of
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
say:
we
were
going
to
refrain
from
it.
you
said:
district
judge,
your
honor,
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness.
didn't
have
any
qualifications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
difference
is
that
in
day
counsel
didn't
know
that
he
had
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
so
the
court
suggested
it.
in
this
case
the
defendant
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
attorney
knew,
the
state's
attorney
knew,
they
had
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
and
nevertheless
told
the
court
we
won't
challenge
timeliness.
there
is
a
big
difference
between,
if
that's
the
background
of
day
where
the
lawyer
didn't
know
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
defense;
and
this
one
was
the
lawyer
knew
very
well
there
was
and
decided
to
tell
the
district
court
not
to
--
not
to
deal
with
that
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
a
system
where
the
court
doesn't
raise
issue
on
its
own.
the
ordinary
rule
is
the
party
presents
it,
and
when
the
party
says
to
the
court
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness,
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
a
different
thing
from
just
having
an
answer
that
doesn't
raise
the
defense.
it's
affirmatively
representing
to
the
court
that
we
--
we
are
not
making
this
an
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
did
say
that
if
--
if
a
party
knowingly
waives
a
limitations
defense,
then
no
court
can
bring
it
up.
the
party
has
made
its
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
a
question
of
time.
when
a
state
deliberately
refrains
from
challenging
a
federal
habeas
petition
as
filed
too
late,
may
a
court
of
appeals
on
its
own
initiative
dismiss
the
petition
as
untimely?
the
answer
we
hold
is
no.
colorado
prisoner,
patrick
wood,
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
court
in
2008,
19
years
after
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
state
court.
in
the
interim,
wood
pursued
ultimately
unavailing
petitions
for
state
court
relief.
upon
receiving
wood's
petition,
the
district
court
asked
the
state's
attorney,
“do
you
plan
to
argue
that
the
petition
was
untimely?”
the
state
twice
told
the
court,
it
would
not
challenge,
but
was
not
conceding
the
timeliness
of
wood's
petition.
thereafter,
the
district
court
rejected
wood's
claim
on
the
merits.
on
appeal,
the
tenth
circuit
directed
parties
to
brief
both
the
merits
and
the
question
whether
wood's
petition
had
been
timely
filed.
post-briefing,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
denial
of
wood's
petition,
but
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
petition
was
untimely.
we
reverse
the
tenth
circuit's
judgment.
as
our
recent
decisions
explain,
federal
courts
have
discretion
to
consider
on
their
own
motion,
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
the
state
failed
to
raise
in
answering
a
habeas
petition,
but
that
authority
should
be
reserved
for
exceptional
cases.
it
should
not
be
exercised
when
a
state
is
aware
of
a
timeliness
defense
and
intelligently
chooses
not
to
rely
on
it
in
the
court
of
first
instance,
that
is
what
occurred
here.
the
state
was
well
aware
of
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
and
of
the
arguments
it
could
make
in
support
of
that
defense.
nevertheless,
the
state
informed
the
district
court
both
preliminarily
and
in
its
formal
answer
that
it
would
not
challenge
the
timeliness
of
wood's
petition.
the
state
does
deliberately
relinquish
the
limitations
defense
and
invited
a
decision
on
the
merits.
because
the
state
waived
the
objection
that
wood
sued
too
late,
the
tenth
circuit
should
have
followed
the
district
court's
lead
and
decided
the
merits
of
wood's
claims.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
