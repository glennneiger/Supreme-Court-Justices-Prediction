justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
what's
the
case
that
supports
you
the
most
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
please
give
me
a
citation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
has
to
be
what?
what's
the
word?
unequivocal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
told
me
the
statute.
now,
i
did
look
at
black's
law
dictionary,
and
black's
law
dictionary,
looking
up
forfeiture
and
waiver,
it
seems
like
you
lose.
my
analysis
would
be
this.
forfeiture
is
the
"loss
of
a
right"
--
that's
what's
at
issue
--
"because
of
a
crime".
that
doesn't
apply.
"because
of
a
breach
of
obligation.
"
"neglect
of
duty".
now,
that
does
because
you
didn't
file
the
answer
okay?
so
it's
forfeited.
now
you
look
over
to
waiver
and,
as
you
say,
it
says
"voluntary
relinquishment
of
a
legal
right.
"
okay,
what's
the
legal
right?
the
legal
right
is
to
get
the
case
dismissed.
so
i'm
the
judge.
i
say:
state,
do
you
want
to
get
the
case
dismissed?
i
just
gave
your
answer.
okay.
i
say
you
voluntarily
relinquish
your
legal
right.
your
legal
right
was
to
get
the
case
dismissed,
and
you
relinquished
it.
you
didn't
assert
it.
that
said,
that
would
be
the
difference.
and
she's
saying
that.
she's
saying
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
when
you
read
day,
they're
worried
about
the
state
doing
something
inadvertently,
making
a
mistake.
so
what
the
judge
says
is:
state,
you
know
you
have
a
pretty
good
claim
here
on
statute
of
limitations,
but
you
didn't
assert
it.
so
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
right
to
assert
it.
go
ahead,
assert
it.
even
though
it's
late.
you
overcome
the
forfeiture.
now
you
say:
i
assert
it,
your
honor.
okay,
you
haven't
waived
it.
now
you
say:
i
don't
really
care.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
i
assume
they
didn't
do
anything
mean,
unstrategic.
it
wasn't
a
trick.
it
was
just
what
is
it
that
they
did?
and
what
they
did
is
they
were
given
the
opportunity
to
overcome
the
forfeiture,
to
assert
the
statute
of
limitations
claim,
and
they
didn't
do
it.
they
didn't
want
to
do
it.
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
want
to
do
it
because
there
was
a
lot
of
trouble
raising
other
issues,
dah,
dah,
dah.
but
that's
their
business.
the
fact
is
they
didn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait,
wait.
when
you
say
"further",
i
want
to
be
very
precise
about
the
distinction.
you
have
to
put
it
in
your
answer.
you
didn't.
okay.
so
that's
a
forfeiture.
so
now
the
judge
says
you
didn't
put
it
in
your
answer,
but
i'll
raise
it.
so
now
you
have
the
right
to
have
the
case
dismissed
for
statute
of
limitations.
do
you
want
to
exercise
that
right?
the
answer
to
that
question
was
you
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
you
didn't
care.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
one,
do
the
characterization,
but
please
don't
forget
my
first
question,
because
so
far
i'm
just
stuck
on
black's
law
dictionary.
and
i
would
like
you
to
have
better
authorities
for
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
your
colleague
on
the
other
side,
why
she
made
this
point
the
way
she
made
it.
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement,
at
least
as
far
as
i
hear
justice
scalia.
look,
he
did
abandon
his
right,
the
state,
to
push
the
matter.
that's
abandonment.
he
didn't
abandon
the
right
to
get
the
case
dismissed
if
the
judge
pursues
it.
so
your
colleague
says,
she,
says,
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
the
power
on
its
own
to
overcome
a
forfeiture.
that's
day.
but
they
don't
have
the
power
on
its
own
to
overcome
the
waiver.
and
that's
what
they
are
doing.
they
don't
have
the
power,
in
other
words,
to
decide
it
themselves.
they
only
have
the
power
to
overcome
a
forfeiture.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
a
bad
result?
the
--
i
--
imagine
the
facts
are
these.
the
state
forgets
to
waive
the
issue,
to
raise
the
issue
in
its
defense,
all
right?
forgets.
judge:
"state
you
haven't
raised
a
statute
of
limitations.
"
state:
one
possible
answer.
"thank
you,
your
honor.
"
"we
overlooked
our
forfeiture,
we
want
to
raise
it.
"
that's
one.
number
two:
they
say,
"we
don't
care".
number
three:
"we
don't
want
to".
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
in
two
and
three,
you
can
say
this;
you
could
say
the
reason
that
we
depart
from
the
normal
rule
that
you
have
to
actually
assert
it
in
your
defense
is
we
are
trying
to
protect
the
state
--
because
of
habeas.
so
we
protect
the
state
at
least
by
giving
them
a
chance
to
make
the
argument
when
they
forget
or
some
other
reasons.
now
we
gave
them
a
chance.
now
they
say
huh
--
who
cares?
all
right,
if
that's
their
attitude,
why
is
it
the
habeas
court's
business
to
protect
the
state
from
themselves?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
despite
forfeiture.
