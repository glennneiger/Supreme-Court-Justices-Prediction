ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenth
circuit,
after
finding
that
mr.
wood's
petition
presented
two
substantial
claims,
denied
him
habeas
relief
solely
on
the
ground
that
his
petition
was
untimely.
it
did
this
even
though
the
state
had
done
three
things
that
should
have
precluded
this
result:
first,
the
state
deliberately
relinquished
a
known
statute
of
limitations
defense.
second,
in
doing
so
the
state
acted
strategically,
not
inadvertently.
and
third,
in
doing
so
the
state
induced
the
district
court
to
expend
substantial
resources
in
deciding
claims
of
exhaustion
and
deciding
claims
on
the
merits.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
i'm
proposing
a
clear
line
that
would
divide
situations
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
power
and
those
in
which
it
absolutely
has
no
power.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
i
would
say
it's
a
question
of
power,
and
this
is
why.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
well,
what
i'm
proposing
is
that
there
are
situations
when
it
is
never
a
proper
exercise
of
the
appellate
court's
jurisdiction
to
consider
sua
sponte
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
even
in
the
habeas
context.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
correct,
that
in
day
the
court
said
that
courts
--
"courts";
it
wasn't
directed
at
appellate
courts,
but
--
no
court
would
be
free
to
disregard
a
deliberate
waiver
of
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
well,
that's--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--that's
our
primary,
our
primary
argument,
is
that
there
was
a
deliberate
waiver
in
this
case
and,
given,
what
this
court
said
in
day,
the
case
could
be
resolved
on
that
narrow
ground.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
that's
correct
and
my
position
also
is
that
there
is
an
overlap
between
those
boxes
and
that
when
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
is
forfeited
in
the
sense
of
not
being
preserved
in
a
timely
manner
--
because
of
a
deliberate
choice,
i
mean
--
and
in
this
instance--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well
i
clearly
want
a
decision
that
would
favor
my
client.
this
--
this
court
granted
cert
on
two
issues
and
certainly
this
case
presents
the
first
issue,
which
is
whether
a
court
of
appeals,
once
the
state
has
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
and
chooses
not
to,
whether
the
court--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
both
--
the
district
court
ordered
the
state
to
announce--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
probably
yes.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
that's
correct.
if
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
is
after
it
was
in
day,
because
in
day
when
the
issue
arose
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
under
traditional
treatment
of
statute
of
limitations
defense
there
was
still
time
for
the
state
to
announce
--
there
was
still
time
for
the
state
to
change
or
to
raise
the
statute
of
limitations
defense.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
or
a
purposeful
forfeiture.
i
mean,
there
are
forfeitures
by--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
handled
it
will
create
problems
if
it's
approved
by
this
court,
because--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--what
happened,
your
honor,
is
that
we
were
appointed
at
the
certificate
of
appealability
stage
and
we
were
ordering
to
brief
timeliness.
perhaps
i
took
the
order
too
literally.
i
briefed
timeliness,
but
i
also
set
out
exactly
what
happened,
which
is
in
the
briefs
and
which
sets
forth
the
state's
position.
the
court
itself
raised
day
and
raised
its
limited
authority
under
day
to
consider
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
they
found,
rather
than
a
deliberate
waiver,
which
i
believe
the
record
supports,
that
the
state's
comments
were
cryptic,
and
i
will
stress--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--no.
i
--
the
court
was
aware
of
day
and
the
court
analyzed
what
it
was
doing
under
day
and
it
determined
whether
there
was
a
deliberate
waiver.
once
the
court
found
there
was
a
deliberate
waiver,
i
definitely
challenged
that
finding.
i
--
there
is
a
very
strong
argument
not
included
within
the
--
the
questions
presented,
that
this
is
a
totally
timely
petition.
and
it's
only,
it's
a
very
difficult
argument.
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
shows
how
much
the
state's
actions
in
the
district
court
were
strategic.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
silent
on
the
impact
of
the
19
--
we
were
not
silent
on
the
impact
of
the
1995
motion.
we've
always
said,
and
in
fact
the
state
has
never
disputed,
that
that
was
a
properly
filed
motion,
and
the
only
issue
was
whether
it
was
tolled
--
whether
it
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations
period
until
2004.
and
the
state
realized
that
that
issue
--
if
they
were
to
prevail
on
the
timeliness
issue,
it
was
a
very,
very
difficult
issue.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
i
understand
your
question
now.
when
mr.
wood
was
pro
se,
he
filled
out
pro
se
motions,
and
in
those
pro
se
motions
he
did
say
that
there
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
2004
motions
--
he
said
there
was
no
prior
post-conviction
motion.
and
i
believe
he
was
confused
because
if
you
look
at
the
forms,
both
the
federal
forms
and
the
state
forms
that
show
what
a
--
a
defendant
should
check,
it
makes
it
sound
like
a
motion
has
to
have
been
ruled
on;
and
mr.
wood
was
pro
se
and
simply
confused.
and
no
one
else
was
confused
once
the
state
entered
their
appearance.
they
knew
that
the
1995
motion
was
still
pending.
all
they
had
to
do
was
sit
at
a
computer
and
bring
up
the
minute
orders
from
the
state,
and
they
could
learn
that.
so
the
courts
in
making
their
rulings
always
from
the
time
--
and,
you
know,
one
of
the
reasons
why
what
happened
was
so
strategic,
and
so
clear,
is
that
the
district
court
had
initially
dismissed
mr.
wood's
petition
as
untimely.
and--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--uh-hmm.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
both.
and
with
respect
to
the
first
argument
about
there
being
a
difference
between
a
party
presenting
an
issue
and
a
court
sua
sponte
raising
the
issue,
there
is
a
difference.
and
the
courts,
the
circuit
courts
do
not
always
make
that
distinction
and
do
not
always
focus
on
that.
for
example
in
granberry
it
actually
was
a
case
where
the
party
presented
--
the
state
presented
on
appeal
the
exhaustion
issue,
and
the
court
agreed
to
hear
it
even
though
the
state
hadn't
raised
it
below.
here,
you
know,
at
least
five
times
in
our
joint
appendix
you'll
see
the
court
saying
that
they
can't
act
as
an
advocate
for
the
petitioner.
and
in
fact
when
the
petitioner,
mr.
wood,
tried
to
raise
an
--
the
exhaustion
issue
again,
the
tenth
circuit
in
its
certificate
of
appealability
said
he
is
bound
by
his
decision
to
dismiss
these
unexhausted
claims,
notwithstanding
his
pro
se
status.
and
in
the
same
breath,
the
court
of
appeals
resurrected
the
at
least
concededly
forfeited
statute
of
limitations
defense
on
behalf
of
the
state.
but
i'd
also
like
to--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--it
raises
different
concerns.
my
concern
is
not
the
relative
power.
it's
that
when
a
court
is
raising
something
sua
sponte
it
defeats
the
party
presentation
principle.
that's
one
concern.
when
the
court
is
--
when
the
party
raises
it
after
having
forfeited,
everyone
concedes
here
that
they
wouldn't
be
allowed
to.
so
in
essence
what
happens
is
the
court
is
acting
as
a
super
advocate
for--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
that--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
and
that
was
--
i
was
going
to
--
i
had
a
second
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
kagan,
which
is
there
is
something
really
different
going
on
in
granberry
and
in
day,
and
you
can't
add
the
two
and
come
up
with
a
neat
package
such
as
what's
suggested
by
the
state.
and
in
granberry,
of
course,
as
the
court
all
knows,
the
court
was
dealing
with
exhaustion,
and
it
was
dealing
with
exhaustion,
which
goes
to
the
heart
of
habeas
and
comity
and
all
those
concerns,
at
a
time
when
dismissing
a
case
to
exhaust
claims,
all
that
would
do
is
delay
federal
relief.
it
wouldn't
eliminate
federal
relief.
and
this
court
in
rhines
v.
weber
recognizes
that
when
aedpa
--
aedpa
was
passed,
it
transformed
the
landscape,
and
it
really
made
some
changes.
and
whether
the
--
the
notion
in
granberry
that
exhaustion
can
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
transfers
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
think
there
is
real
doubt
about
that,
and
i
think
that
goes
to
an
important
question,
and
the
question
that
the
court
granted
cert
on.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
not
for
this
purpose.
and
by
"this
purpose"
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals'
authority
to
raise
sua
sponte
the
defense.
in
day,
this
court
--
there
were
two
prongs
to
day.
in
the
context
of
day.
which
was,
you
know,
where
the
state
had
filed
a
rule
5
response
and
patently
erroneously
calculated
the
--
the
limitations
period,
and
the
court
noticed
it
and
there
is
no
law
that
required,
as
this
court
held,
the
court
to
muzzle
itself
and
not
mention
you've
miscalculated
these
days.
we
are
in
a
totally
different
situation.
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
allowed
what
happened
in
day.
they
don't
allow
what
happened
in
our
case.
and--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--i'm
referring
to
civil
rule
of
procedure
8(b)
and
12.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
well,
there
is
the
traditional
rule
that
if
you
don't
raise
it
you
lose
it,
when
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
and
it's
really
key
here,
because
when
aedpa
engrafted
this
1-year
statute
of
limitations
into
the
habeas
proceedings
it
knew
how
1-year
statute
of
limitations
were
treated.
and
yes,
in
day,
quite
correctly
the
court
held
that
in
that
context
you're
going
to
treat
those
defenses
the
same,
especially
with
respect
to
rule
4,
which
would
allow
a
court
to
dismiss
a
petition
just
on
its
face.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
well,
if
the
state
had
challenged
timeliness
at
the
stage
that
aedpa
contemplates
it
would,
it
would
have
created
a
real
complicated
issue
on
abandonment,
and
i
think
the
briefs
suggest
just
how
complicated
that
is
under
colorado
law.
and
if
that
had
happened,
the
court
very
well
could
have,
district
court,
could
have
appointed
counsel
for
mr.
wood
--
i
mean,
if
there
had
been
an
evidentiary
hearing,
if,
as
the
tenth
circuit
found,
the
issue
was
so
complex
that
counsel
was
necessary.
so
once
you
had
counsel,
in
the
state's
reply
or
in
its
answer
they
indicated
that
several
of
mr.
wood's
claims
were
not
exhausted,
and
some
of
those
claims
were
in
that
1995
motion
that
was
pending.
with
counsel,
there
could
have
been
a
request
for
"a
stay
and
abey".
there
could
have
been
so
much
that
was
done.
mr.
--
but
because
the
state
chose
to
simplify
the
proceedings,
that's
what
they
did,
and
it
was
not
inadvertent;
it
wasn't
a
mistake.
they
chose
to
make
it
simple
and
to
focus
on
exhaustion,
so
they
got
four
claims
dismissed
on
exhaustion
grounds,
and
then
they
dealt
with
the
other
two
claims
on
the
merits.
they
also
had
a
procedural
default
issue
which
was
totally
unconstitutional.
they
were
relying
on
a
procedural
default
that
didn't
exist
at
the
time
you
had
to
raise
it.
but
that
simplified
the
proceedings,
made
it
more
a
question
of
the
law.
mr.--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--absolutely
we
should
not.
but
we
also
should
hold
them
to
that
strategic
choice,
which
is
what
day
says
you
do,
and
we
have
to
hold
them
to
that
choice
because
there
were
consequences
and
there
were
changes
of
positions.
and
they
got
the
benefit
of
going
forward
and
just
looking
at
exhaustion.
they
eliminated
the
risk
of
an
evidentiary
hearing.
they
eliminated
the
risk
of
a
lawyer.
they
induced
mr.
--
they
induced
mr.
wood
to
dismiss
four
claims
because
--
oh,
sorry.
because
--
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
see
you.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
no
--
because
he
was
assured
that
he
could
go
forward
on
two
substantial
constitutional
claims
without
worrying
about
time
bar,
because
the
state
said
that.
they
said
twice:
we
are
not
challenging,
we
will
not
challenge
timeliness.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
well,
the
connection
is,
the
state
guaranteed
that
they
would
not
challenge
timeliness.
and
that
allowed
mr.
wood
to
go
forward
on
two
constitutional
claims
without
ever
having
to
worry
that
they
would
be
subject
to
time
bar.
and
when
the
court--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--oh.
because
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
challenged
timeliness,
they
would
have
raised
this
very
complicated
issue,
because
the
only
way
they
can
win
on
timeliness
is
to
win
on
this
newfangled
notion
of
abandonment
under
colorado
law,
which
under
colorado
law
requires
a
hearing
and
requires
factual
development.
and
once
they
pursued
in
the
district
court
that
claim
of
abandonment,
it
was
very
likely
that
a
lawyer
would
be
appointed.
that
lawyer
could
see
that
there
were
claims
still
pending
in
the
1995
motion,
and
could
possibly
have
sought
a
stay
and
abey;
could
have
gone
and
tried
to
exhaust
those
claims,
serious
constitutional
claims
that
were
in
the
1995
motion.
and
maybe
a
better
way
of
putting
it
is
if
they
had
raised
timeliness
in
the
district
court,
abandonment
would
have
been
front
and
center.
and
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
ultimately
resolved
this
issue
without
an
evidentiary
hearing,
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
itself,
too.
it
was
totally
contrary
to
colorado
law,
analyzing
that
issue.
it
is
no
small
thing
that
the
position
that
they
took
in
the
district
court
allowed
mr.
wood
to
go
forward
on
two
claims,
two
constitutional
claims
that
are
substantial
that
the
court
has
granted
a
certificate
of
appealability
on.
this
is
--
this
case
is
so
unlike
day,
in
the
sense
--
if
an
appellate
court
can
raise
sua
sponte
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
case
like
this,
it
can
raise
it
in
any
case.
it
invites
the
state
to
take
a
position
in
the
district
court
which
would
be
totally
contrary
to
aedpa's
desire
for
streamlined
proceedings.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
it
may
be.
i
believe
in
some
of
the
briefs
what
i've
said
is
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
rule
5's
requirement
that
the
defense
be
set
forth
and
the
traditional
recognition
that
statute
of
limitations
is
lost
if
not
raised.
and
i
cited
the
court
to
jones
v.
bock,
which
stresses
that
for
mere
policy
reasons
we
shouldn't
deviate
from
the
rules
that
would
otherwise
apply.
and
i
think--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
that's
the
district
court,
and
that's
one
of
the
key
differences
between
the
district
court
and
the
appellate
court.
the
appellate
court
can
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability.
the
district
court
has
that
prescreening
function,
which
is
just
like
the
prescreening
function
in
the
plra,
where
this
court
looked
at
a
circuit's
attempt
to
create
rules
that
would
address
policy
concerns
and
deviated
and
put
an
enhanced
pleading
requirement
on
prisoners,
and
said
--
i
believe
unanimously
--
unanimously,
that
that
shouldn't
be
done.
there's
a
real
virtue
in
having
a
predictable
rule.
there's
a
real
virtue
in
letting
the
states
or
--
letting
the
states
know
in
the
context
of
this
court's
federal
timing
rules
that
they
have
to
raise
it,
the
statute
of
limitations
defense,
when
they
are
ordered
to
and
when
rule
5
requires
them
to.
you
should
not
adopt
the
state's
position
when
it
will
just
invite
the
sort
of
sandbagging
that
this
court
has
taken
care
to
avoid.
you
don't
want
straddling
by
the
state
on
something
as
important
to
judicial
efficiency
as
asserting
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
timely
manner.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
oh,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
the
problems
with
the
rulings
urged
by
the
amicus
and
by
the
state
are
severalfold.
one,
it's
not
contemplated
at
all
by
aedpa
that
the
1-year
federal
timing
statute
of
limitations
would
be
subject
to
such
a
wide
latitude
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
resurrect
defenses.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
it
would
be
a
violation
of
rule
5,
which
requires
them
to
assert
a
time
bar
if
they
are
required
to
file
a
response.
in
our
case,
it
also
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
court's
order.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
probably
not.
but
if
you
are--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--well,
by
not
conceding,
that
doesn't
undercut
the
deliberateness
of
the
waiver.
it
actually
establishes
it.
it
establishes
that
they
know
that
there's
a
defense,
and
they're
not
agreeing
that
the
petition
is
timely,
but
they're
deliberately
choosing
not
to
assert
the
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
i'm
sorry.
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
in
the
face
of
rule
5's
requirements,
it
could
very
well
be
a
waiver.
and
i'd
cite
the
court
to
hill
v.
new
york,
which
also
addresses
one
of
the
state's
lawyers'
points,
which
was
a
waiver
--
for
the
state
to
waive
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
its
waiver
has
to
be
unequivocal
and
clear.
i
don't
know
if
they're
suggesting
that
there
also
has
to
be
an
advisement
by
the
court.
i
don't
think
they're
going
that
far.
but
the
fact
is,
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
waiver,
or
--
the
right
being
waived.
and
this
court
recognized
in
hill
v.
new
york
and
other
cases
that
if
the
right
being
waived
--
for
example,
the
right
to
be
tried
in
a
timely
fashion
under
iab,
it
can
be
waived
just
by
a
lawyer
accepting
a
date.
and
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
here
is
a
typical
strategic
decision.
and
when
aedpa
brought
this
in,
it
didn't
bring
it
in
as
it
brought
in
comity.
it
is
something
to
move
the
case
along
from
the
federal
point
of
view.
and
for
this
court
to
adopt
what--
ms.
kathleen
a.
lord
--the
state
is
suggesting
will
just
take
away
all
the
efficiencies
that
--
that
that
1
year
brought
to
bear.
