justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
lift
a
boat
over
niagara
falls.
and
i
--
and
i
read
somewhere
that
--
and
i
hope
i
am
wrong,
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
read
somewhere
that
the
land
under
niagara
falls
has
long
been
considered
to
be
navigable,
and
therefore,
it's
owned
by
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
owned
by
the
state.
i
mean,
the
navigable
--
i
get
mixed
up
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
navigable
ones
are
owned
by
the
state.
okay.
everybody's
thought
the
land
under
niagara
falls
is
owned
by
the
state.
oh
dear,
because
that
sort
of
wrecks
our
nice
theory
that
all
the
steps,
all
the
little
bits
of
it
that
are
non
--
that
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
now
we
have
to
define
what's
an
extended
strip.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
how
much
are
we
wrecking
if
we
just
say,
look,
the
bit
that's
non-navigable
is
different
from
the
bit
that's
navigable,
period?
doesn't
matter
if
it's
5
--
5
feet
of
land
or
not.
what
--
what
are
we
wrecking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
quick
question
that
you
could
probably
answer
just
by
saying:
we
decided
not
to.
but
i
was
somewhat
curious.
it's
really
the
united
states
v.
montana
in
this,
who
owns
the
land,
and
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
it's
going
to
be
highly
factual
no
matter
what
this
happens.
made
for
this
court's
original
jurisdiction.
and
--
and
normally
in
original
jurisdiction,
we
appoint
a
master,
it's
worked
out,
and
we
review
the
master's
report.
we
can't
do
that
here
because
it's
a
case
about
--
why
didn't
you
go
into,
or
why
couldn't
you
go
into,
a
quiet
title
action
at
the
lower
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
out
of
--
i
mean,
to
waste
your
time
for
a
second.
why
do
the
feds
own
the
land
underneath
the
--
and
why
--
under
the
nonnavigable
part?
why
--
why
do
the
feds
own
--
own
the
land
under
--
under
nonnavigable
streams?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
a
little
creek
somewhere
which
you'd
think,
gee,
those
belong
to
the
state,
but
it
turns
out
the
feds
own
the
land
underneath
the
little
creek;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
so
the
rule
is
on
the
non-navigable
streams
it
depends
on
what
the
conveyance
was
at
the
time
of
statehood,
and
those
are
individual
matters,
and
sometimes
you
see
the
feds
own
them
and
sometimes
the
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
now,
montello
was
a
case
--
to
follow
up
this
same
question.
montello,
i
take
it
was
not
a
title
case.
montello
was
a
regulation
of
the
stream
case.
so
i
can
understand
perfectly
well
why
that
language
in
montello
applies
for
the
reason
justice
kennedy
just
said.
now,
i
grant
you
that
in
later
title
cases
this
court
has
taken
the
same
words
and
written
them.
but
is
there
an
instance
in
the
later
title
cases
where
that
language
has
played
a
controlling
role?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
case
should
i
look
at
to
see
--
was
really
meant
that
this
--
to
start
with
where
justice
scalia
was
and
say
what
justice
kennedy
just
said
and
then
thinking
well,
i'm
thinking
well
montello
is
a
case
that
involved
a
different
purpose
and
now
the
later
cases,
although
they
quoted
the
language,
it
didn't
have
a
role.
am
i
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
how
do
i
find
that
out.
if
i
start
with
a
practical
premise
of
not
wanting
to
interrupt
expectations.
i
also
believe
that
it's
the
most
common
thing
in
the
world
for
electric
power
companies
to
put
hydroelectric
facilities
where
there
are
water
falls
or
rapids
and
that's
true
all
over
the
country.
so
what's
the
status
quo
with
the
--
you
know,
somebody
could
count
up
how
many
hydroelectric
plants
there
are
on
water
falls
and
what's
the
general
view?
are
those
hydroelectric
companies
been
thinking
that
they
are
leasing
or
buying
from
the
feds
or
from
the
states?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what's
happened
in
the
past.
and
i
looked
at
the
briefs
and
i
can't
get
a
very
good
picture.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
wreak
havoc,
you
mean
to
say
that
the
states
have
leased
those
strips
with
the
water
falls
which
are
impassable
to
hydroelectric
companies
and
the
leases
will
have
to
be
renegotiated
or
something
like
that?
