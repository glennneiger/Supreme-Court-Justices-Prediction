john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
10-218,
ppl
montana
v.
montana.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
it
demonstrates
the
non-navigability
of
the
particular
stretch,
but
we
would
still
speak
of
the
transfer
of
commerce
as
being
along
the
river.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sort
of
the
case
or
analogy
i
was
thinking
of
is
if
i
say
i
fly
from
washington
to
tokyo,
and
someone
says,
"no
you
didn't;
you
flew
to
san
francisco,
then
you
walked
however
many
yards
from
one
gate
to
another,
and
then
you
flew
to
tokyo.
"
and
i'd
say,
"well,
yes,
there
is
a
gap
there
when
i
walked
--
part
of
the
distance
where
i
wasn't
flying.
"
but
people
would
still
say
you
flew
from
d.c.
to
tokyo.
now
why
isn't
this
just
like
that,
that
the
commercial
path,
the
commercial
waterway
people
think
of
as
the
missouri.
and
yes,
occasionally
you
have
got
to
get
out,
and,
you
know,
we
can
debate
how
long
the
portage
is,
but
it
doesn't
it
interrupt
the
notion
that
that
whole
pathway
would
qualify
as
a
navigable
waterway.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
think,
though,
if
you
start
drawing
these
lines,
they
become
very
difficult,
in
some
rivers
anyway,
to
--
to
apply.
i'm
sure
there
are
seasonable
fluctuations.
they
may
be
navigable
in
some
seasons,
but
not
in
others.
the
line
at
which
you
pass
from
navigability
to
non-navigability
may
be
difficult
to
ascertain.
it
seems
to
me
once
you
start
chopping
the
highway
of
commerce
up,
it
does
create
all
those
difficulties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
answer
a
moment
ago
gives
me
pause.
you
--
you
said
the
united
states
would
not
be
bound
by
this
litigation,
but
could
bring
its
own
quiet
title
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
odd.
maybe
this
is
--
maybe
this
is
justice
alito's
earlier
question.
it's
kind
of
odd
that
the
more
navigable
the
river
is,
the
more
claim
the
state
has.
the
less
navigable
--
you're
talking
about
sportsboats
and
drift
fishing
--
then
it's
federal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
are
talking
about
the
land
at
the
bottom
of
the
--
the
river.
what
is
it
that
the
state
can't
do
on
the
navigable
waterways
that
it
wants
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
has
the
same
consequences.
it
seems
to
me
that
regardless
of
who
prevails
in
this
case,
the
state
will
be
able
to
exercise
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
the
waters.
you
know,
you
can't
fish
during
these
seasons,
or
there
are
different
limits
on
how
many
fish
you
can
take.
and
so
will
the
federal
government.
it
will
be
able
to
apply
federal
law
to
the
river
regardless
of
who
owns
parts
of
the
river,
regardless
of
who
owns
the
land
underneath.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
without
regard
--
but
i
would
say
without
regard
to
whether
they
happened
to
own
the
land
under
the
river
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
haven't
talked
much
about
the
madison.
what
is
your
best
piece
of
evidence
with
respect
to
the
madison
for
the
proposition
that
it
was
navigable
at
statehood?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
fur
trappers
are
going
to
go
--
they
don't
need
a
lot
of
water
to
ply
their
canoes
up
the
river.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
now
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-218,
ppl
montana,
llc
versus
montana.
