mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
montana
supreme
court
committed
three
basic
errors
with
respect
to
all
three
rivers
that
require
a
remand
for
further
proceedings
to
actually
weigh
and
make
factual
findings
concerning
the
evidence
of
the
relevant
reaches
of
the
river
for
purposes
of
navigability
for
title.
we
are
not
talking
about
navigability
for
interstate
transportation
or
admiralty
or
regulatory
jurisdiction
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
or
the
clean
water
act.
we
are
talking
about
navigability
for
title.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
the
montello,
for
example,
the
question
was
whether
there
was
admiralty
or
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
the
use
of
vessels
on
the
upper
reaches
of
the
river,
and
that
depended
in
the
court's
view
on
whether
that
stretch
was
part
of
an
interstate
or
international
highway
of
commerce.
and
so
it
would
make
sense
to
look
at
the
whole
river
in
determining
whether
it's
a
highway;
and
maybe
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
highway,
you
would
look
to
a
bypass
stretch.
you
would
look
at
the
highway,
the
land
highway
to
decide
whether
its
useful
in
interstate
commerce.
for
title
purposes,
though,
the
question
is
what
happens
to
the
stretch
of
the
river
right
in
front
of
the
riparian
owner's
land.
as
mr.
clement
said,
that
reflects
the
expectations
of
the
property
owner,
that
if
there
are
no
ships
or
boats
going
back
and
forth,
that
that
property
is
--
adheres
to
the
riparian
lands
more.
i
also
think
it
--
it
pertains
to
the
control
or
use
of
the
beds
of
the
rivers
themselves.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
first
of
all,
we're
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
chopping
the
river
up
into
narrow
slices.
i
mean,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
discernible
and
substantial
segment
of
the
river.
often
--
often,
it
will
be
self-evident
from
the
geo
--
topographical
features
of
the
area.
are
there
major
falls
and
rapids
over
an
extended
period
of
time?
but
also,
the
points
you're
raising
are
--
i
think
are
inherent,
because
in
deciding
where
navigability
stops
under
any
test
or
in
any
circumstance,
you
could
have
the
difficulties
that
you
have
described.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
may
well
be.
i
think
--
i
think
an
important
--
i
agree
with
the
points
that
mr.
clement
made
as
guideposts.
i
think
another
one
--
and
this
pertains
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
--
i
think
it
has
to
be
--
i'm
speaking
of
a
situation
where
the
river
is
not
navigable
in
fact.
and
that's
the
test,
navigable
in
fact,
not
navigable
in
law.
if
a
--
if
a
boat
cannot
pass
in
front
of
the
riparian
land,
then
that
would
be
non-navigable.
i
agree
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--for
title
purposes,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i
think
at
some
--
if
you
--
if
you
consider
part
of
the
--
part
of
what
is
going
on
here
is
who
controls
the
riverbed.
i
think
it
would
be
unworkable
to
have
a
passage,
a
portion
of
a
river
where
you
have
10-foot
strips
across
the
river
that
are
riparian
owner-owned,
and
the
state
owned
everything
else,
or
if
you
had
stripes
across
a
river.
so
i
think
--
i
think
the
test
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
montello,
the
--
there
is
evidence
that
the
boat
was
lifted.
the
men
got
out
of
the
boat
and
lifted
the
boat
up
over
the
falls.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
that
situation.
but
if
you
have
a
long
stretch
of
--
of
river
where
that
was
not
practicable
--
then
you--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
owned
by
the
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
reply
brief
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
not
an
--
i
think
that's
not
an
extended
strip
in
the
way
that
--
the
way
that
we're
discussing
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it
does
matter
whether
it's
5
feet,
because
the
--
because
an
important
point
here
is
that,
who
can
make
sensible
use
or
control
the
relevant
stretch
of
the
river.
if
it's
5
feet
or
10
feet
and
you
had
strips
that
stayed
private--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
could,
and
we
have
not
given
consideration
to
that,
but
that
might
be
--
that
might
be
a
possibility.
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
this
case
and
couldn't
be
--
and
couldn't
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ordinarily,
the
united
states
would
not
intervene
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
or
if
it
did
it
would
remove
the
case
to
federal
court.
so
that
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
--
an
additional
consideration
as
to
whether
to
get
into
this
suit.
the
united
states
would
--
would
typically
bring
its
own
quiet
title
action
in
--
in
federal
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
would
be
bound
by
this
court's
decision,
obviously.
but
i
was
just
speaking
of
the
law
of
--
the
law
of
judgments.
and
if
this
court
remands
back
to
the
trial
court
with
general
directions
but
doesn't
adjudicate
particular
stretches
definitively,
then,
you
know,
i
think
we
--
that's
the
situation
that
we
would
--
that
we
would
be
in.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
assume
so.
obviously,
that
would
be
a
--
that
would
be
a
further
consideration.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i
think
if
they
--
i
think
if
they
can
take
it
through
the
river,
it's
not
an
interruption
at
all.
but
if
--
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
something
that
can't
be
transversed
by
a
boat
at
all
and
it's
long
enough
that
it
could
sensibly
be
thought
of
as
a
--
as
a
separate
parcel
adhering
to
the
--
to
the
riparian
land
--
that
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
didn't
carry
the
boat
out
of
the
river.
these
were
durham
boats
that
were
70
feet
long
and
--
and
weighed
quite
a
bit.
now,
maybe
there
were
small
canoes;
that
could
have
been
done.
i
--
i
think
a
small
portage.
again,
i
don't
think
it's
the
length
of
the
portage.
i
think
it's
the
interruption
of
the
--
of
the
navigable
portion
of
the
river
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
relevant.
if
it's
large
enough
to
constitute
a
--
a
sensible
administrable
parcel,
that
that
should
be
enough.
i
did
want
to
take
one
moment
to
discuss
the
madison
river
because
there,
as
mr.
clement
discussed,
the
considerations
are
somewhat
different.
first
of
all,
the
court
made
a
similar
mistake
there
by
discussing
the
river
as
a
whole,
and
the
log
float
in
the
middle
stretch
of
the
river,
but
not
focusing
on
the
relevant
stretches
where
the
dams
are
located.
but
it
also
put
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
current
recreational
use
by
drift
boats
and
what-not
without
proper
foundation
to
--
to
determine
whether
that
was
relevant
for
title
purposes
at
statehood,
because
the
relevant
question
is
whether
whatever
boats
are
used
now
are
ones
that
would
have
been
used
as
custom
--
this
is
the
language
from
the
daniel
ball
--
as
"the
customary
modes
of
travel"
--
"travel
and
transportation
at
the"
--
"at
the
time
of
statehood".
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
--
that's
a
product
of
the
--
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
and
the
court
has
long
said
that
the
state
gets
the
beds
of
navigable
waters.
