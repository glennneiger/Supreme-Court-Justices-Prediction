thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
shouldn't
matter
whether
it's
2.8
miles
or
1
mile,
right?
i
mean,
if
the
land
is
non-navigable
--
if
the
river
at
that
point
is
non-navigable,
it's
non-navigable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
for
title
purposes.
i
don't
see
why
there
--
there
ought
to
be
any
de
minimis
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
international
boundary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it's
also
an
international
boundary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
to
which
there
is
a
different
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
what
purpose?
were
they
--
were
they
--
were
we
answering
the
question
for
the
same
purpose,
or
were
we
asking
it
for
purposes
of
whether
federal
regulation
could
extend
to
the
whole
river?
for
that
purpose,
it's
easy
to
say
if
the
whole
river
is
--
you
know
--
used
for
commerce,
the
federal
government
can
regulate
even
those
portions
of
the
river
that
are
non-navigable,
that
--
but
that
have
to
be
portaged
around.
but
that's
a
different
question
from
who
--
who
owns
title
to
the
--
to
the
bed
under
the
--
the
portions
that
have
to
be
portaged.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
they
are
closed
where
they
are
--
they're
impassable
for
ships
anyway.
they're
closed.
what
do
you
mean,
remain
open?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
--
you've
got
falls.
you've
got
waterfalls,
you
got
rapids.
what
does
it
mean
to
be
sure
that
that
river
remains
open
to
commerce?
commerce
is
impossible
over
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
has
it
held
that.
do
you
have
a
case
where
it
would
have
made
a
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
this
is
such
an
understood
and
traditional
rule,
why
didn't
montana
make
its
rights
known
earlier
when
these
private
owners
bought
the
land?
indeed
the
state
gave
them
condemnation
power
to
flood
adjacent
lands
so
that
they
could
build
their
dams.
and
you
say
while
all
this
was
going
on,
well
of
course
everybody
knew
that
montana
owned
this
land.
now
they
come
back
what,
100
years
later
and
they
not
only
want
to
get
the
land
back,
they
want
to
tax
them
for
their
use
of
it
over
all
these
100
years?
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
you
say
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
private
individuals.
i
thought
you
said
it
belongs
to
the
united
states
if
it
doesn't
belong
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
are.
and
you
think
the
united
states
is
going
to
keep
off
these
fishermen.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
think
they
are
wrong,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
willing
to
concede
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
if
we
find
that
the
state
does
not
have
ownership
of
the
bed,
the
state
does
not
have
regulatory
jurisdiction
for
all
of
these
purposes
that
you
were
now
describing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
your
argument
doesn't
carry
much
weight.
the
state
can
continue
to
regulate
all
those
things
whether
or
not
it
owns
the
bed.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
sovereignty
over
the
land
owned,
owned
by
other
private
persons.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
united
states
demand
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
riverbed?
for
the
riverbed
land?
