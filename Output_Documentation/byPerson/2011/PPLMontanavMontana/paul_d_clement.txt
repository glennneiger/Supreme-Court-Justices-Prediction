mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state's
claim
to
back
rent
here
is
truly
remarkable.
when
these
dams
were
built
back
in
the
day,
ppl's
predecessors,
petitioner's
predecessors,
secured
all
the
necessary
property
rights
and
easements.
as
part
of
that
process,
particularly
for
the
dams
that
created
reservoirs,
there
was
an
elaborate
process
of
getting
flood
easements
and
in
many
cases
paying
substantial
amounts
of
money.
in
that
process,
nothing
was
hidden;
it
was
open
and
notorious.
indeed,
the
state
assisted
by
lending
the
utilities
its
eminent
domain
power
to
deal
with
holdouts.
but
now,
100
years
later,
the
state
comes
in
with
a
holdout
claim
of
its
own
and
suggests
that
it's
entitled
to
massive
compensation
based
on
the
small
strip
of
riverbed
that
lies
underneath
these
flooded
reservoirs
and
the
dams.
the
montana
supreme
court
allowed
that
claim
to
succeed
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
of
back
rent.
now
it
seems
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
where
i
was
going,
justice
kennedy.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
montana
supreme
court
could
only
approve
this
result,
which
clearly
did
unsettle
settled
expectations,
by
deviating
from
well-settled
principles
of
federal
navigability
law.
now,
the
mistakes
were
a
little
bit
different
for
each
of
the
rivers
at
issue.
as
to
the
clark
fork
and
the
upper
missouri,
the
critical
error
i
believe
with
the
montana
supreme
court
decision
was
its
failure
to
focus
on
the
river
segments
that
are
directly
at
issue
and
instead
focus
on
the
river
as
a
whole.
with
the
madison
the
errors
are
different,
because
with
the
madison
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
stretch
of
that
river
was
navigable
at
statehood.
so
there
the
problem
was
principally
that
the
court
relied
on
modern
day
evidence
of
recreational
use
to
substitute
for
true
historic
evidence
of
commercial
navigation
at
statehood.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i
mean,
it's
close
to
the
end
of
the
trail.
i
mean,
you
can
go
back
to
the
daniel
ball,
but
that's
not
going
to
help
you
any
more
than
the
montello.
i
think,
though,
that
the
critical
cases
really
are
utah
--
but
i
also
think
there
are
other
cases
that
this
court
has
had
--
oklahoma
v.
texas
would
be
an
example
--
where
this
court
has
looked
as
a
discernible
segment
of
a
river.
brewer-elliott
is
another
one.
and
i
think
the
starting
point
for
the
court's
analysis
in
every
one
of
these
cases
has
been
to
look
at
the
segment
of
the
river
that
is
at
issue,
that
has
been
put
at
issue.
now,
if
you
have
a
sovereignty
battle
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
a
lot
of
times
it's
the
segment
of
the
river
within
the
state,
or
in
brewer-elliott
it
was
the
segment
of
the
river
adjacent
to
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
really
isn't,
justice
alito,
because
we
get
our
common
law
from
england.
in
england
actually
the
common
law
was
different.
at
england,
the
navigable
waters
ended
at
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide,
so
every
internal
stream
within
great
britain
was
viewed
as
non-navigable
and
the
property
belonged
to
the
riparians.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
i
mean,
it
was
--
it
was
adopted
as
part
of
--
the
sort
of
--
just
the
idea
of
creating
the
sovereign
republic
of
the
united
states.
we
borrowed
our
common
law.
i
think
initially
nobody
focused
on
these
navigable
segments.
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
issue
really
doesn't
even
arise
in
the
eastern
united
states,
because
until
about
1850
this
idea
that
states
could
own
the
river
beds
if
they
were
non-navigable
never
really
occurred
to
anyone.
so
in
most
of
the
eastern
states
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
whether
a
river
is
navigable
or
non-navigable,
the
riparian
owns
to
the
middle
of
the
stream
bed.
so
after
1851
this
court
recognizes
--
makes
clear
to
the
states
that
they
actually
have
a
choice,
and
so
the
states
that
come
into
the
union
after
1851,
many
of
them,
including
montana,
adopt
the
rule
that,
well,
unless
these
streams
--
if
these
streams
are
non-navigable,
then
we
take
the
river
stream.
and
so
that's
where
the
question
comes
up.
so
maybe
the
reason
there
isn't
a
great
deal
of
precedent
on
this
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
this
is
an
issue
that
largely
arises
in
the
western
united
states.
but
that's
why
i
think
it's
such
a
mistake
to
kind
of
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth,
so
to
speak,
and
not
focus
on
utah,
because
utah
is
a
situation
that
seems
irreconcilable
with
the
montana
supreme
court
decision
and
the
state's
basic
theory,
because
there
the
special
master
and
this
court
recognized
a
non-navigable
segment
right
in
the
middle
of
two
navigable
portions
of
stream.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
happy
to
try,
but
i
think
--
i'm
not
going
to
give
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i've
thought
about
this
a
lot,
justice
sotomayor,
and
i'm
not
here
to
give
you
a
sound
bite
that's
a
bright-line
definition
of
"de
minimis".
i
think
de
minimis
almost
by
its
nature
takes
its
--
its
meaning
from
the
context
of
the
inquiry.
but
let
me
--
let
me
offer
at
least
three
guideposts
that
i
think
are
helpful.
one,
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
this
court
can
look
to
its
own
cases
dealing
with
islands
in
a
navigable
stream,
and
those
cases
are
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief.
and
this
court's
cases
say
if
there
is
a
small
island
in
a
navigable
stream,
under
an
acre,
of
negligible
value,
we
basically
ignore
it.
later
cases,
though,
came
along
and
dealt
with
islands
that
were
much
larger,
and
the
court
analyzed
those
separately
from
the
navigable
stream,
and
said
the
united
states
actually
retains
ownership
to
the
larger
islands,
and
they
don't
go.
so
that's
one
place
to
look.
the
second
place
to
look,
i
think,
is
also
a
practical
judgment
based
on
the
nature
of
the
lawsuit.
and
here
the
state
itself
has
come
in
and
identified
stretches
of
riverbed
that
they
think
are
significant
enough
to
generate
$50
million
in
back
rent.
and
i
think
they,
having
identified
those
riverbed
stretches
as
being
worth
$50
million,
are
hard
pressed
to
then
turn
around
and
say,
oh,
but
they
are
de
minimis,
just
ignore
them.
the
third
rule
i
would
point
to
is
that
i
think
topography
has
something
of
a
role
to
play
here.
if
you
look
at
the
special
master's
report
in
utah
or
some
of
the
other
cases
that
have
decided
the
point
at
which
the
navigability
stops,
they
pointed
to
features
of
the
river
as
defining
a
discernible
segment
like
a
tributary
coming
in
or
the
geology
of
the
--
of
the
bed
over
which
the
river
runs,
if
it
shifts
from
kind
of
a
silty
loam
to
hard
rock
in
a
canyon,
that's
something
that
you
can
point
to.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
but,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
--
i
mean,
there
are
sort
of
two
portages
that
are
floating
around
in
the
montello
and
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
there
is
kind
of
the
classic
overland
portage
between
the
fox
river
and
the
wisconsin
river.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
afterwards.
but
originally
that
was
an
overland
portage.
and
so
that's
really
not
at
issue.
but
that's
kind
of
you
know,
--
the
classic
portage
i
have
in
mind
is
an
overland
portage.
now,
they
are
also
talking
about
the
extreme
efforts,
and
you
could
call
them
portages.
i
don't
think
you
need
to,
but
there
is
also
talk
about
the
extreme
efforts
to
enable
navigation
on
the
fox
before
improvement.
but
that's
nothing
like
what's
at
issue
here
because
those
were
efforts
basically
to
use
the
riverbed
to
--
and
they
had
to
do
some
extraordinary
things:
an
ox
to
pull
the
boat;
lift
them
up
over
some
rocks.
but
they
never
really
left
the
bed
of
the
river
there.
where
they
left
the
bid
of
the
river
was
the
portage
over
the
wisconsin.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure,
but
my
understanding
of
what
was
going
on
there,
and
maybe
i
misunderstood
it,
but
i
understand
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
a
portage
where
you
take
the
cargo
out
of
the
boat
in
order
to
lighten
the
draft
of
the
boat
so
it's
not
sitting
as
deeply
in
the
river,
and
that
allows
the
lighter
boat
to
be
carried
over
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
that
may
be,
but,
i
mean,
again,
i
don't
think
we
are
talking
about
anything
like
the
distances
that
we
are
talking
here,
and
also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
sure,
because
these
are
all
matters
of
degree,
and
those
would
be
two
different
cases.
but
here's
what
i
would
point
you
to.
which
is,
if
--
at
the
point
that
you
have
to
take
the
cargo
off
of
the
boats,
and
then
you
then
have
to
leave
the
channel,
you
don't
just
do
a
little
cut
around
some
de
minis
amount,
but
you
leave
the
channel
and
go
overland,
at
that
point,
i
think,
that
portage
demonstrates
the
non-navigability
of
the
bypass
stretch.
and
then
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
very
much
dispute
factually
that
there
ever
was
this
kind
of
commercial
portage
over
the
great
falls.
and
there
is
really,
you
know,
there's
very
little
evidence
for
the
record.
the
state's
own
evidence
identifies
fort
benton
30
miles
below
the
great
falls
as
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
missouri.
so
there
is
very
much
a
factual
issue
here.
but
to
answer
the
legal
question
you
are
asking,
first
of
all,
i
am
not
sure
i
would
have
the
same
instinct
about
common
parlance
if
you
had
to
go
from
jfk
to
la
guardia
in
a
cab.
and
i'm
even
less
sure
that
you
would
have
the
same
notion
if
you
had
to
drive
from
san
francisco
to
la
to
switch
planes.
and
i
think
the
distance
here
really
does
matter.
and
i
would
submit
the
way
you
think
about
this,
the
way
i
would
think
about
this
is
that
the
very
need
to
bypass,
especially
a
substantial
bypass
where
you
leave
the
river
channel,
is
evidence
that
that
part
of
the
channel,
that
part
of
the
river
is
nonnavigable.
and
then
the
question
that
is
left
is
whether
that
is
de
minimis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i'm
with
you
on
that,
justice
alito,
and
i
think
logically
if
you
think
what's
the
highway
of
commerce
here,
if
there
was
this
18-mile
overland
portage
rout,
that
would
be
the
highway
of
commerce.
but
the
17-mile
bypass
stretch
of
the
missouri
and
the
great
falls
reach
would
not
be
a
highway
of
commerce.
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
the
expectations
of
the
property
owner
that
ultimately
underlie
these
title
questions.
i
mean,
if
you
have
boats
going
by
a
river
in
your
backyard,
i
mean,
you
have,
you
are
on
sort
of
notice
that
you
don't
own
the
riverbed.
but
if
you
are
in
a
part
of
the
river
that
is
so
unnavigable
that
it
has
to
be
bypassed
and
you
have
never
seen
a
boat
in
your
experience
ever,
then
i
think
you
have
very
different
expectations,
and
your
expectations
would
be
the
same
as
somebody--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
is.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
can
i
take
both
points.
i
mean,
you
are
absolutely
right.
17
miles
have
very
long.
i
mean,
for
the
new
yorkers,
you
know,
the
east
river
is
16
miles
long,
the
whole
river.
the
anacostia
river
is
8
1/2
miles
long.
so
this
bypass
stretch--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
these
--
this
is
still
a
big
stretch.
and
i
do
think
that,
like
you
said,
longer
than
some
entire
rivers.
but
the
thompson
falls,
i
mean,
the
two
miles
of
the
thompson
falls,
i
don't
know
exactly
where
that
number
comes
from.
its
kind
of
an
artificiality.
i
mean,
there
--
again,
the
state's
own
evidence,
look
at
j.a.
57
says
that
navigation
stops
at
thompson
falls.
there
wasn't
a
portage
around.
but
the
other
point
is
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
the
1910
court
decree
because
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
you
know,
these
companies
do
just
put
these
dams
up
overnight
as,
you,
kind
of,
as
a
lark.
they
went
through
elaborate
efforts
to
secure
the
property
rights.
that's
what
generated
the
1910
court
decree
about
the
clark's
fork
river.
the
clark's
fork
river
court
decree
in
1910
addresses
a
stretch
of
rivers
specifically
that
is
just
the
falls
but
the
six
miles
of
the
reservoir
that's
created.
and
the
court
holds
that
that
entire
region
and
indeed
the
entire
clark
fork
in
sanders
county
is
nonnavigable.
so
the
stretches
that
are
nonnavigable
are
much
longer
than
two
miles.
if
i
may
reserve
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first,
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
mean,
i
don't
have
any
de
minimis
portages
for
you.
the
portages
he's
talking
about,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
5-mile
and
8-mile
are
portages
between
rivers,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
bypassed
stretch
of
the
river
would
be
non-navigable
because
it's
de
minimis,
because
if
you
portage
between
two
rivers,
you're
not
bypassing
anything.
where
i
can
talk
about
sort
of
portages
being
de
minimis,
if
you
look
at
the
special
master's
report
in
the
utah
case,
there
are
a
few
places
in
the
cataract
canyon
where
he
talks
about
portages,
and
he
talks
--
you
know,
in
parts
where
they
got
boats
to.
but
the
--
the
key
point
is,
whenever
the
court
has
talked
about
portages
in
the
context
of
navigability,
they've
pointed
to
them
as
suggesting
non-navigability.
and
in
certain
circumstances,
well,
you
had
to
portage
a
little
bit,
but
that's
not
enough
to
make
the
stretch
non-navigable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i've
given
you
a
couple,
i'd
start
with
the
deeds.
your
honor.
you
know,
the
--
the
state
wants
to
make
something
of
the
fact
that
the
deeds
stop
at
the
river.
but
that's
true
throughout
the
state.
and
the
question
then
becomes
what
rule
governs
the
ownership
of
the
riverbeds?
and
that's
where
navigability
versus
non-navigability.
so
the
deeds
don't
prove
anything.
that's
just
the
way
the
deeds
were
written.
the
next
point:
justice
kagan,
you
asked
about,
you
know,
did
the
other
owner
--
other
people
on
the
river
have
anything
to
fear.
and
the
answer
as
far
as
i
heard
was,
well,
these
are
different.
they
sit
on
the
riverbed.
well,
two
things,
your
honor:
so
do
some
of
the
peers.
and
that's
why
people
have
filed
amicus
briefs
and
are
very
concerned.
but
more
to
the
point,
these
things
have
not
moved
under
the
riverbed
recently.
they've
been
sitting
there
for
100
years,
and
the
state
lent
its
eminent
domain
power
to
us
to
help
us
build
these
dams.
these
dams
were
critical
to
developing
energy
and
development
in
this
area.
and
now
100
years
later,
they
want
compensation
for
the
little
river
strip--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
pay
the
united
states
compensation
right
now.
the
difference
is,
the
united
states
isn't
going
in
afterwards
and
trying
to
put
a
hold-up
to
us
and
saying
it
wants
$50
million
for
this.
we
pay
rents
to
ferc
for
some
of
these
lands.
actually,
the
state
gets
37.5
percent
of
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
look
at
footnote
3
of
the
government's
brief.
i
mean,
again,
the
problem
here
is
if
you
want
people
to
have
deeds
that
really
are
--
parse
out
whether
it's
riverbed
or
upland,
they
don't
because
everybody
defaults
to
the
bottom
line
--
the
background
rule.
the
background
rule
is
if
it's
a
non-navigable
river,
the
riparian
owners,
whether
it
be
the
united
states
or
private
property
owners,
get
to
midway,
or
if
they
own
both
on
both
sides,
they
get
the
whole
thing.
i
think
on
de
minimis,
we've
talked
about
it
a
lot.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
one
thing
we
know
that
is
not
de
minimis
from
utah
is
4.35
miles.
because
that's
what
the
court
analyzed
separately
in
the
portion
of
cataract
canyon.
every
stretch
at
issue
here,
every
dam
at
issue
here,
is
more
than
4.35
miles.
fully
five
of
the
dams
are
on
the
17-mile
great
falls
stretch,
which
they
agree
is
impassable.
the
other
five
are
reservoir
dams
that
create
reservoirs
that
extend
over
4.35
miles.
there's
nothing
de
minimis
in
the
best
evidence
that
is
the
$50
million
in
compensation.
i
think
the
$50
million
in
background
also
shows
that
although
this
is
a
dispute
between
montana
and
the
united
states,
my
client
is
caught
in
the
middle
of
it,
and
they
are
obviously
concerned
about
it,
too.
i
want
to
talk
about
what's
disputed
and
what's
undisputed.
what
is
undisputed
is
the
17
miles
is
impassable.
that's
enough,
as
i
say,
to
give
us
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
five
dams
on
that
stretch.
what
is
hotly
disputed,
despite
my
friend's
representation,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
through
commerce
through
this
bypass
route.
he
suggests
it's
undisputed
that
gold
went
from
helena
down
to
fort
benton
down
to
st.
louis.
and
that
of
course
is
not
disputed.
but
it
went
on
roads.
it
didn't
go
on
the
upper
missouri.
and
if
you
want
to
know
who's
got
the
better
of
this
argument,
i
ask
you
to
think
about
this
question:
the
united
states
army
built
a
600-mile
overland
road
from
fort
benton,
the
traditional
head
of
navigation
on
the
missouri,
to
walla
walla,
washington.
now,
if
the
state
is
right
and
the
upper
missouri
and
the
clark
fork
were
navigable,
all
they
had
to
do
was
have
a
60-mile
road
to
connect
the
two.
they
were
never
navigable.
thank
you,
your
honor.
