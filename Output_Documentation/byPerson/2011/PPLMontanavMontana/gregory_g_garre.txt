mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
who
owns
the
riverbeds
underlying
the
rivers
at
issue.
it's
not
about
flood
lanes;
it's
about
the
riverbeds.
and
under
this
court's
precedents,
it's
settled
that
title
to
the
riverbeds
is
conveyed
to
the
state
under
the
constitution
if
they
are
navigable.
it's
been
understood
in
montana
for
more
than
a
century
that
these
rivers
are
navigable.
the
rivers
were
meandered
as
navigable.
ppl's
deeds
--
and
this
is
at
page
172
of
the
appendix
to
the
opposition
brief
--
specifically
exclude
the
riverbeds.
the
test
for
navigability
that
this
court
has
applied
for
140
years,
going
back
to
the
montello
and
the
daniel
ball,
is
whether
the
river
served
as
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce.
in
the
montello,
the
court
recognized
the
fact
that
few
of
the
nation's
great
rivers
did
not
include
some,
quote,
"serious
interruptions
to
uninterrupted
navigation".
and
the
--
and
the
court's
answer
to
that
geographic
fact
was
not
to
say
then
let's
carve
out
the
interruptions
and
say
those
aren't
navigable.
the
court's
answer
was
to
say
unbroken
navigation
is
not
required
to
establish
navigability.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
have
to
show
that
the
commerce
traveled
along
the
river
under
the
customary
modes
of
trade
and
travel.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
you
take
the
great
falls,
the
history
of
portage
from
1864
to
1868
was
lively
commerce
of
millions
of
dollars,
in
today's
value
billions
of
dollars
of
gold,
from
helena
to
fort
benton
back
east.
this
is
covered
in
detail
by
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
we've
appended
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
question
presented
is
whether
the
montana
supreme
court
or
whether
a
court
--
a
court
--
what
the
constitutional
test
would
be
for
a
court
in
this
situation.
it's
not
even
limited
to
the
montana
supreme
court
here.
it
presents
a
legal
question.
with
respect
to
summary
judgment,
the
problem
for
ppl
is
not
that
it
didn't
present
enough
paper;
the
problem
is
it
litigated
the
case
under
a
wrong
legal
theory.
it
litigated
the
case
that
the
--
that
the
missouri,
for
example,
was
not
navigable
because
you
couldn't
take
a
boat
down
the
falls.
this
court's
precedents
for
more
than
140
years
asked
the
question
of
whether
the
river
served
as
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce.
we
presented
evidence,
summarized--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
ppl
recognizes
that
the
daniel
ball
supplies
the
test
for
navigability
for
title.
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
utah
case,
the
vanguard
title
case
that
they
hold
out.
so
the
only
question
is
did
the
montello
apply
the
daniel
ball
test
or
did
it
apply
something
else?
and
the
first
paragraph
of
the
court's
decision
in
the
montello
said
it
applied
the
daniel
ball
test.
courts
--
this
court
and
lower
courts
for
more
than
a
century
have
understood
the
daniel
ball
and
the
montello
to
supply
the
test
for
navigability
of
title.
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
upend
more
than
140
years
of
precedent
and
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
states
in
this
case
gives
--
gives
the
court
a
sense
of
the
disruption
that
this
would
cause.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
reason
for
the
rule
was
the
public
trust
doctrine
which
--
which
sought
to
keep
these
rivers
free
for
the
public
to
use
for
navigation,
for
fishing
and
for
other
uses;
and
this
court's
precedents--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it
gets
back
to
the
--
the
public
trust
doctrine,
your
honor.
fishing
doesn't
have
--
fishing
is
a
purpose
of
the
public
trust
doctrine,
which
is
why
it
was
understood--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because
the
navigable
rivers
were
the
arteries
of
commerce
in
this
country,
and
at
the
time
of
the
founding
it
was
understood
--
and
this
gets
to
the
core
issue
of
federalism
in
this
case
--
that
the
states
ought
to
be
the
ones
that
control
the
navigable
rivers,
not
the
federal
government.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
this
gets
back
to
the
question
of
whether
you
can
just
chop
up
the
rivers
into
navigable
and
nonnavigable
bits.
and
we
are
talking
--
this
court,
justice
o'connor
observed
in
her
dissent
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case
that
navigability
wasn't
decided
inch
by
inch.
what
the
other
side
is
asking
you
to
adopt
here
is
a
test
of
navigability
that's
at
least
by
mile
by
mile,
if
not
acre
by
acre,
which
is
completely
different
than
this
court
has
ever
assessed
navigability.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
what
--
what
the
framers
were
concerned
about
and
this
is
also
reflected
in
the
northwest
ordinance
2,
was
ensuring
that
the
navigable
waters,
the
major
arteries
of
commerce
in
this
country,
remained
open.
and
so
they
--
they
applied
a
much
more
--
much
broader
conception
of
navigability
than
as--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
so
that
was
the
argument--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
so
that
was
the
argument
that
the
district
court
adopted
in
the
montello
case,
and
this
court
emphatically
rejected
it.
and
by
the
way,
the
portage
in
the
montello
case
was
5
miles
long.
that's
reflected
in
the
--
the
record
in
that
case
before
this
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
it's
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
relevant
stretch
or
segmentation
is
really
a
litigation
term.
our
position
is
this
court's
test:
continuous
highway
of
commerce.
you
would
take
the
part
of
the
river
at
issue
in
a
case,
take
that
part
and
look
--
ask
the
question,
was
that
part
of
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce
or
not?
so
if
you
found
yourself
in
cataract
canyon
in
the
utah
case,
you
would
ask
yourself
that
question,
and
you
would
say,
no,
this
was
not
part
of
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce
because
no
one
argued
either
that
the
canyon
was
portaged
or
that
goods
was
traveling
down
the
colorado
river
through
the
canyon
and
out
into
arizona.
if
you
ask
yourself
that
question
in
this
case
along
the
great
falls,
you
would
say
yes,
because
the
evidence
was
unrebutted
that
millions
of
dollars
of
gold
was
traveled
up
from
helena
to
fort
benton
along
the
--
the
missouri
river
with
the
aid
of
a
portage,
and
that
that
was
unquestionably
a
highway
of
commerce.
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
chop
rivers
up
into
navigable
and
nonnavigable
pieces.
how
would
that
impact
the
public
trust
doctrine?
the
--
the
brief
filed
by
the
national--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
united
states
has
sided
completely
with
montana.
the
answer
it
gives
for
what
is
a
short
interruption
in
its
brief
is
an
interruption
that
doesn't
warrant
separate
consideration.
that's
on
page
17
of
its
brief.
that's
the
epitome
of
a
circular
test,
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
if
you
--
if
you
applied
the
proper
test
here
you
would
conclude
that
the
river--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
what
--
the
nonnavigable
parts--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--didn't
transfer
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
oftentimes
those
were
subject
to
separate
conveyances,
so
they
might
come
into
private
property.
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
what
was--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
what
was
critically
important
to
the
--
to
the
framers
was
that
the
states
would
have
control
over
the
navigable
waterways.
this
court
has
described
that
as
an
essential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
owner
--
ownership
--
along
with
ownership
goes
the
right
to
control
whether
facilities
can
be
built
on
them,
bridges
or
pipelines;
it
goes
--
along
with
that
goes
the
rights
to
mineral
leases--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
that
the
test
that
we
are
articulating
is
the
daniel
ball
and
montello
test
--
continuous
highway
test.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
riverbeds,
it's
always
been
understood
that
with
controlled
riverbeds,
along
navigable
waters,
states
have
a
right
to
control
fishing,
navigation
and
other
aspects.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--this
case
has
recognized
always
that
the
daniel
ball
and
the
montello
is
the
test
for
navigability
for
title
as
well
as
admiralty.
it
has
never
drawn
the
kind
of
distinction
that
ppl
and
the
united
states
has
asked
be
drawn
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
not
of
this
court.
the
lower
courts--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--have
relied
upon
the
daniel
ball
and
montello
in
plenty
of
circumstances
adjudicating
a
title.
i
think
the
court
has
to
think
about
what
the
world
would
look
like
if
the
court
adopted
ppl
united
states--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--ppl's
deeds,
your
honor,
ppl's
deeds
exclusively
exclude
the
riverbeds
at
issue
in
this
case.
so
ppl
can
have
no
claim
to
those
lands,
and
in
fact
in
its
supplemental
brief
says
that
the
united
states
owns
the
lands.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
flood
lands
here,
we
are
talking
about
between
the
low
water
marks.
those
lands
were
surveyed
and
meandered
at
statehood
to
show
that
they
did
not
convey
to
private
parties.
montana
courts
have
recognized
for
more
than
a
century
that
these
waters
are
not
navigable.
everybody
understood
that
they
were
--
navigable.
the
reason
why
this
issue
only
arises
now
is
because
of
a
1999
decision
of
the
montana
supreme
court
that
said
that
the
state,
made
clear
that
the
state
had
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
seek
compensation
for
the
use
of
the
riverbeds.
so
that
then
teed
up
the
question
of
whether
the
state
could
actually
charge
rent
for
the
riverbeds.
the
state
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
are
not
using
the
riverbeds,
your
honor.
the
reason
why
the
facilities
here
are
using
the
riverbeds
is
because
they
actually
sit
on
it.
there
are
other
instances
where
private
land
owners
have
easements
and
leases,
like
mineral
leases
with
the
state,
under
the
--
because
of
the
accepted
understanding
that
the
state
does
own
those
lands.
and
this
is
not
at
all
unusual.
if
you
look
at
the
state's
brief,
washington
and
oregon
have
thousands
of
these
types
of
permits
because
it
is
established
that
if
the
water
is
navigable
than
the
state
owns
the
riverbeds
and
there
are
consequences
that
flow
over
this.
but
this
really
isn't
a
fight
between
the
state
and
the
private
land
owners.
it's
a
fight
between
the
state
and
the
united
states.
because
if
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
think
there
are
other
land
owners
who
have
asserted
--
who
want
rights
to
get
minerals
along
rivers
or
have
peers
or
bridges,
and
in
those
situations
they
get
permits
from
the
state
to
use
it.
but
i
think
what's
going
to
happen
is
if
this
court
declares
that
every
mile
or
so
that
is
in
interruption
is
nonnavigable,
then
title
is
going
to
transfer
to
the
united
states
because
under
this
court's
precedent
in
utah,
the
court
held
that
if
waters
were
not
navigable
the
united
states
would
have--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--a
mile
stretch?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
two
areas
at
issue
here
is
the
great
falls
stretch--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--so
the
test
would
be
any
non-de
minimis
interruption,
that's
the
one
that
ppl
and
the
united
states
are
urging
here.
there
are
thousands
of
dams
in
the
country.
there
is
niagara
falls
which
for
more
than
a
century
its
been
understood
that
the
state
owns
it,
not
because
its
an
international
boundary,
that's
a
line
plucked
out
of
the
decision.
read
the
decision
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
best
evidence
i
think
we
have
about
this
question
of
the
implications
comes
from
the
brief
filed
by
26
states,
which
explains
that
if
this
court
adopts
the
kind
of
segmentation
approach,
any
interruption
that
is
not
de
minimis
has
to
be
carved
out
it's
going
to
wreak
havoc
in
states
across
the
country
especially,
in
the
western
states.
again,
getting--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i'm
not
referring
to
specific
leases
on
that.
i'm
talking
about
things
like
public
access
for
fishing,
for
example.
the
state
decided
that
the
steelheader
case
in
oregon,
and
this
is
what's
going
to
happen,
either
the
public
--
private
landowners
are
going
to
claim
people
coming
along
my
banks
to
fish,
they
don't
have
access
to
these
waters.
if
they
were
navigable
--
understood
as
navigable
waters
owned
by
the
state,
it's
clear
that
they
had
would
have
access.
there
is
going
to
be
clashes,
there's
going
to
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
this
court
has
said
is
if
it's
not
navigable,
the
united
states
has
it.
the
question
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
question
is
whether
there
would
be
a
separate
conveyance
from
the
united
states.
there
is
certainly
going
to
be
plenty
of
private
landowners,
i
think,
who
are
going
to
claim
private
ownership.
so
there
is
going
to
be
some
sorting
out
to
do.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
no.
if
the
river
is
not
navigable,
then
the
land
didn't
convey
under
equal
footing
doctrine.
there
would
be
a
separate
question
of
whether
they
conveyed
by
some
other
federal
patent,
land
patent,
or
the
like.
and
there
are
certainly
--
certainly
are
plenty
of
those.
but
i
think
what
is
clearer
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
united
states
is
here.
it's
given
its
views.
it's
true
that
it
didn't
participant
below
and
it
is
a
little
bit
unusual.
what's
weird
is
that
the
united
states
has
never
actually
asserted
ownership
to
the
riverbeds
in
this
case.
but
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
with
respect
to
the
riverbeds.
there
is
a
statement
in
the
brief
that
suggest
that
they
pay
rent.
that's
with
respect
to
the
upland,
the
flooded
lands,
for
example,
along
the
reservoir.
the
united
states
has
never
charged
rent
for
the
use
of
the
riverbeds
themselves
between
the
low
water
marks.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there
certainly--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
are
two
--
well,
there
is
three
distinctions
between
the
test
for
title
and
the
test
for
regulatory
purposes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
none
of
which
bear
on
the
dispute
in
this
case.
one
is
for
title.
you
look
at
the
time
of
statehood.
you
don't
look
at
the
river
at
a
later
time.
the
next
is,
is
that
for
purposes
of
title,
you
look
at
the
river
in
its
natural
state.
you
don't
look
at
improvements.
and
the
third
is,
for
purposes
of
title,
kind
of
commerce
you
consider
is
actually
more
expansive
in
the
type
you
could
consider
for
regulatory
purposes.
this
case,
the
focus
has
been
on
the
rivers
at
the
time
of
statehood,
their
use
as
highways
of
commerce
without
improvements,
which
is
in
the
heartland
of
the
test
for
navigability
under
the
daniel
ball
and
the
montello.
none
of
the
distinctions
that
this
court
has
ever
recognized
would
bear
on
this,
nor
would
it
make
any
sense,
i
think,
to
say
that
the
rule
that
we
identified
in
the
montello
that
has,
for
more
than
a
century
has
been
established
as
the
test
for
title
for
navigability
somehow
has
to
be
applied
differently
in
this
case
in
a
way
that
would
require
breaking
up
the
rivers.
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
think
the
united
states'
position
is,
say
they
are
navigable
for
federal
purposes
but
not
for
state
purposes.
and
i
think
--
and
they
have
taken
what
i
think
is
a
pretty
remarkable
position.
if
we
look
at
the
brief
that
we
have
appended
to
our
brief,
the
united
states
in
the
montana
power
company
case,
the
united
states
is
saying,
the
very
same
stretch
of
the
missouri
along
the
great
falls
is
navigable
because
it
serves
as
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce
and
the
falls
did
not
prevent
the
river
from
being
used
as
a
continuous
highway
and,
therefore,
it's
navigable
under
the
montello
and
the
daniel
ball,
which
is
the
theory
that
they
recognize.
and
now
they
are
here
saying,
well,
that
was
only
for
regulatory
purposes
and
not
for
title
purposes.
but
it's
the
same
test
in
both
cases,
and
that's
the
test
that
the
nation
has
understood
for
more
than
150
years.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
so
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
state's
authority
to
make
those
decisions
as
an
essential
attribute
of
their
sovereignty.
and
that's
why
the
state's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
when
they
own
the
land
under
the
river,
that
--
the
ability
to
control
access
along
those
rivers
and
fishing
and
the
like
is
an
essential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty.
so
just
saying
that,
well,
the
federal
government
and
state
government
can
regulate
together
is,
i
think,
an
important
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
as
this
court
has
always
understood
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
the
public
trust
doctrine.
and
you
also
have
the
problem
of
competing
regulation
of
these
rivers
when
you
go
from
mile
to
mile,
interruption
to
interruption,
potentially
thousands
along
rivers.
and
that's
laid
out
in
the
brief
by
the
environmental
groups
here,
the
national
wildlife
foundation,
tribal
unlimited
and
other
groups
that
talk
about
the
problems
with
fragmented
regulatory
jurisdiction.
and
you
also
get
into
the
question
of
public
access
for
fishing,
too.
the
rivers
are
used
for
commerce,
but
the
public
trust
doctrine
was
always
used
to
protect
access
to
rivers
for
fishing,
too.
and
so
if
you
look
at
a
place
like
the
great
falls
or
the
thompson
falls,
these
are
among
the
most
sought
after
fishing
rivers
in
the
world.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
so
every
time
this
court
has
said
that
the
ability
to
do
that
is
an
essential
attribute
of
sovereignty,
it
must
not
have
meant
it
because
the
united
states
could
do
it,
too.
i
mean,
it
is
important
to
the
states
because
having
the
sovereign
capacity
over
those
riverbeds
as
navigable
waters
under
the
public
trust
doctrine
is
critical
to
the
state's
authority.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
i
think
it
gets
back
to
the
public
trust
doctrine,
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
utah
case
and
other
cases
about
the
role
of
states
in
regulating
navigable
rivers
and
owning
title
to
the
river
beds
underlying
those
rivers.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
there
was
some
evidence
of
use
by
fur
trappers
and
the
like.
it
was
not
extensive
because
this
area
was
relatively
sparse.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
things
like
pirogues
and
bateaux
were
sufficient
to
establish
the
continuous
highway
of
commerce.
i
think
the
point
on
the
madison
is
the
susceptibility
for
use
as
a
navigable
river.
and
the
main
point
that
we
made
below
is
that
where
their
own
expert
had
recognized
that
ppl's
dams
had
impeded
the
flow
of
water
over
of
the
river,
that
if
those
dams
impede
the
flow
of
water
of
the
river
but
yet
today
there
are
thousands
of
drift
boats
similar
to
the
boats
that
would
have
used
it
at
the
time
of
statehood,
then
it
is
good
evidence
that
it
was
susceptible
for
use.
but
i
think
the
madison
is
in
a
different
category
than
the
missouri
and
the
clark
fork.
i
do
want
to
answer
the
question
about
the
the
des
plaines
river
in
the
economy
light
case,
there
was
an
18-mile
portage.
that's
made
clear
at
page
18
a
of
our
addendum
where
the
government
recognized
that.
in
--
montello
it
was
a
five-mile
portage.
and
there
are
other
examples
of
portages.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
it's
in
the
testimony
in
that
decision.
but
certainly
17
miles
--
and
the
other
thing
is
that
in
the
amicus
brief,
on
page
27
of
the
tubbs
brief,
she
suggests
that
the
actual
portage
before
statehood
was
only
8
miles.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
a
constitutional
line
between
5,
7,
or
even
10
miles
and
17
miles.
we
think
the
line
the
constitution
draws
is
whether
--
asks
whether
the
river
was
served
as
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce,
notwithstanding
any
interruption
along
that
way.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
that's
not
even
a
rule
that
ppl
was
asking
for,
because
they
acknowledge
that
some
interruptions
would
be
navigable.
they
call
it
"non-de
minimis".
it's
not
clear
how
you
get
there.
if
you
go
between
the
low
watermarks,
there's
only
a
part
of
the
way
that
you
could
actually
bring
a
boat
up,
but
yet
it's
established
that
the
state
owns
the
entire
riverbeds
between
low
watermark
to
low
watermark.
after
traversing
the
missouri
and
the
very
falls
at
issue
in
this
case,
meriwether
lewis
described
it
as
"he
didn't
think
the
world
could
furnish
a
finer
example
of
a
navigable
river
through
a
mountainous
country
than
the
missouri.
"
that
assessment
made
by
the
president's
own
agent,
charged
with
assessing
the
suitability
of
the
missouri
for
commerce,
was
consistent
with
more
than
140
years
of
this
precedent--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
it
was
an
11-day
portage.
at
the
time
of
statehood,
it
was
a
one-day
portage.
i
think
what's
significant
is
he
wrote
it
after
that
portage.
and
yet
he
recognized
that
there
was
not
a
finer
example
of
a
navigable
river
through
a
mountainous
country.
that
assessment
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
for
more
than
140
years.
it's
consistent
with
the
actual
use
of
the
missouri
as
a
continuous
highway
of
commerce
along
the
very
stretch
at
issue
here.
we
don't
believe
that
ppl
or
the
united
states
has
--
has
provided
a
legal
reason
for
this
court
to
overturn
the
judgment
of
the
montana
supreme
court
that
the
missouri
or
the
other
rivers
at
issue
in
this
case
are
navigable.
