justice
elena
kagan
and
why
does
that
make
a
difference,
mr.
kneedler?
why
do
you
think
that
there
are
separate
tests
for
title
than
for
regulatory
authority?
justice
elena
kagan
and
what
about
other
land
owners
on
the
riverbeds.
if
montana
wins
this
case
will
they
be
paying
rent
as
well?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
if
i
could
understand
then.
you
think
that
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
landowner.
there
are
no
other
land
owners
in
montana
who
are
in
this
situation
of
ppl?
justice
elena
kagan
does
ppl
pay
rent
to
the
united
states.
