justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
have
intervened
somehow,
because
the
--
the
united
states
has
come
here
rather
reluctantly,
because
you
recommended
against
granting
cert
in
this
case.
when
it
was
in
the
montana
court
and
it
was
a
question
of
what
is
the
federal
law,
the
federal
law
is
going
to
control.
everybody
agrees
with
that.
could
the
united
states
have
come
into
the
proceedings
in
the
montana
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
we
--
if
it
were
remanded,
the
united
states
would
still
stay
out
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
what
is
--
you
say
that
you
are
not
taking
just
--
you
look
at
the
whole
river
as
a
whole.
you
are
saying
no,
that
isn't
the
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
it's
also
not
inch
by
inch.
so
what
--
when
is
segmentation
appropriate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
just
--
so
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
united
states,
which
has
given
us
its
view
of
what
the
federal
law
is.
it
doesn't
coincide
with
montana's.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
you
said,
this
is
genuinely
a
controversy
between
the
states
and
the
united
states,
but
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
and
we
know
from
the
briefing
before
us,
the
united
states
takes
a
different
position
than
montana,
it
doesn't
agree
with
you.
but
if
this
case
--
how
can
a
case
be
decided
without
any
input
from
the
united
states
when
you
say
that's
the
true
dispute
is
between
the
states
and
the
nation?
