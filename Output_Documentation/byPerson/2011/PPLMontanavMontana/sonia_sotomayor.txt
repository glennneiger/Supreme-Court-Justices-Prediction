justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
define
"de
minimis"
for
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
can't,
some
guidance
or
limit
that
we
set
for--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
know
you've
told
me
that
you
think
montello
is
not
pertinent
because
it
involved
a
different
issue.
but
assuming
that
it
were
pertinent,
because
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
its
discussion
doesn't
fit
the
needs
here,
one
of
the
factors
you
haven't
mentioned
in
terms
of
de
minimis
is
the
portage
and
its
use
with
respect
to
commerce;
and
by
that
i
mean,
it
appears
to
me
in
montello,
what
the
court
was
saying
was
the
history
of
use
of
this
river
showed
that
these
obstructions
didn't
stop
the
flow
of
commerce.
that
what
people
did
was
--
it
appeared
some
extreme
things.
they
got
off
--
they
got
their
goods
off
one
boat,
walked
it
a
certain
distance
or
drove
it
by
wagon
another
distance
and
then
put
it
on
another
boat
or
the
same
boat
that
they
had
lessened
the
load
on
and
moved
it
over.
and
so
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
distance
of
that
portage;
it
talks
about
the
impact
on
commerce.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
that
a
factor
in
the
de
minimis
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
there
were
a
history
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
was
a
canal
in
there,
wasn't
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
in
the
montello,
get
they
took
the
cargo
off
some
boats--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
moved
it
overland
to
another
spot
before
they
put
it
back
on
the
boat.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
can
both
look
at
the
opinion,
but
i
think
there
is
one
spot
where
the
court
says
that
in
some
areas
they
had
to
change
boats.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree
with
you,
but
what
i'm
asking
is,
if
we
had
a
history
of
navigation
of
cargo
that
went
to
the
beginning
of
one
of
these
rivers,
and
i'm
not
a
sailor
so
my
terms
--
the
cargo
is
taken
off
and
driven
by
wagon
or
some
other
mode
to
another
spot
and
picked
up
again.
is
that
a
different
situation
than
one
where
that
doesn't
happen?
that
because
this
length
of
portage
is
so
long
that
it
is
both
economically
and
physically
impossible
to
transport
cargo
in
that
way.
is
that
a
different
case
for
the
question
of
navigability?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
17
miles
is
very
long.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
the
thompson
is
only
2.8
and
that
is
really
close
to
montello
where
it
talked
about,
about
two
miles
for
some
portage
areas.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
not
a
midwesterner,
and
rivers
of
200
miles
are
longer
than--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
de
minimis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
2.8
be
de
minimis
in
one
situation
and
not,
and
how
do
we
tell--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
there's
no
falls
but
there
are
riparian
waters
that
don't
permit
navigability
over
2.8,
than
that's
still
navigable?
i'm
not
sure--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--am
i
to
take
that
"de
minimis"
to
you
means
small
enough
so
that
they
get
the
boat
physically
over
the
portage,
whether
they
carry
it,
drag
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
go
back
to
carrying
their
boat
on
their
shoulders,
which
apparently
in
the
montello
they
did.
what's
the
answer--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
theory,
if
there's
a
fall
like
this
of
17
miles,
and
a
train
is
50
miles
away
and
traverses
that
17
miles,
that
portage
is
good
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
outside
of
your
fur
traders
and
your
gold
miners,
has
that
happened
in
any
other
situation
--
your
alleged
gold
miners
and
fur
traders?
has
that
happened
on
--
on
the
--
in
the
great
falls?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
do
me
a
favor
and
you
tell
me
again
--
i
am
having
real
trouble
with
the
competing
evidence
in
this
case
with
respect
to
every
one
of
the
three
areas
in
dispute
and
i
have
some
serious
questions
about
whether
the
court
properly
granted
summary
judgment.
your
brief
seems
to
suggest
that
i
can't
do
--
we
can't
do
anything
about
that
because
it
wasn't
a
part
of
the
question
presented.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
adversary
says
that
it's
a
fair
question
if
we
determine
there
is
any
legal
approach
--
error
in
legal
approach
of
the
court
below.
i'm
assuming
that
also
means
on
their
weighing
of
evidentiary
matters.
so
why
shouldn't
we
address
the
summary
judgment
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
mile
stretch
anywhere
on
this
river.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
is
there
a
mile
stretch
in
which
the
boats
stop?
some
water
in
the
middle--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
know
the
two
at
issue.
but
you're
saying
if
we
rule
the
way
we
do,
we
are
going
to
slice
it
up
and
so
does
the
attorney
--
the
solicitor
general's
office
say,
we
are
going
to
slice
it
up
half
mile
or
half
acre
by
half
acre.
i
am
not
sure
how
that
happens.
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
is
does
a
boat
stop
mid
stream?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
was
that
the
canal
--
what
subsequently
became
the
canal
area.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
then
the
simplest
rule
is,
is
the
river
from
shore
to
opposite
shore
--
any
portion
of
it
--
did
boats
traverse
it.
that
would
be
i
think
what
justice
alito
was
asking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
portages
that
are
de
minimis.
point
me
--
i
don't
care
where
they
are
in
the
united
states
--
give
me
a
list
of
some
that
are
de
minimis.
