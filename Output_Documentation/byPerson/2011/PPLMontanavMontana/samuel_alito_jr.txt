justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
issue
of
whether
we
should
look
to
the
segments
or
to
the
river
as
a
whole,
what
authorities
can
we
consult?
you
rely
heavily
on
u.s.
v.
utah,
and
that
certainly
is
a
relevant
precedent;
but
there
is
disagreement
about
what
it
means
and
the
only
authority
that
i
see
that
u.s.
v.
utah
cited
was
the
montello,
which
seems
to
cite
nothing
whatsoever.
so
where
do
we
--
is
that
the
end
of
the
trail?
is
there
anyplace
else
we
can
look?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
of
this,
i
take
it,
derives
from
the
rule
that
preexisted
--
preexisted
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
that
the
sovereign
owned
the
navigable
rivers
within
its
borders.
is
there
some
body
of
common
law
that
addresses
this,
that
would
shed
some
light
on
whether
that
means
the
whole
river
or
it
means
segments?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
--
what
is
the
origin
of
the
rule
that
the
original
13
states
owned
the
navigable
rivers
or
parts
of
the
rivers,
but
not
the
parts
that
weren't.
that
was
some
feature
of
american
colonial
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
why
portage
is
relevant
at
all.
what
is
the
basis
for
the
rule
that
i
assume
it's
the
sovereign
owns
the
navigable
rivers?
i
assume
it's
because
they
are
viewed,
they
were
viewed
as
highways
for
transportation
and
commerce.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
obstruction
that
cannot
be
traversed
by
a
boat,
then
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
commerce
or
transportation
along
that
area.
now
there
might
be
an
argument
that
the
sovereign
should
own
the
land
next
to
the
river
so
that
you
could
portage
around
it,
but
what,
what
would
be
the
justification
for
saying
the
sovereign
owns
the
portion
of
the
river
that
can't
be
traversed
at
all
by
boat?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
reason
for
the
rule
that
the
states
own
the
navigable
rivers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
fishing
and
navigation
have
to
do
--
for
--
what
does
fishing
have
to
do
with
navigability?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
why
--
why
should
--
why
does
the
state
own
a
navigable
river
but
not
a
non-navigable
river?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
and
if
that's
the
reason
--
if
that's
the
reason
for
the
rule,
than
what
is
the
justification
for
state
ownership
of
a
portion
of
the
river
that
is
not
navigable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
rule
that
you
are
arguing
for
might
be
an
established
rule
that
we
should
follow,
but
as
a
matter
of
theory
i
don't
understand
what
the
justification
is
for
state
ownership
of
a
non-navigable
portion
of
the
river
if
the
reason
for
the
underlying
rule
is
so
that
people
will
not
put
up
obstructions
on
the
river
so
that
they
--
it
can
be
maintained
as
an
--
as
an
avenue
of
commerce.
i
can
see
that
you
--
why
the
state
would
own
that,
because
otherwise
riparian
owners
could
put
up
fences
and
obstructions
and
charge
tolls
and
--
and
that
sort
of
thing;
but
if
it's
not
navigable
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
--
with
commerce
or
transportation.
