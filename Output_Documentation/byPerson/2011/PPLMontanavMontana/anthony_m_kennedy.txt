justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
your
point
that
there
should
be
a
federal
rule
of
--
of
laches
or
estoppel,
or
are
you
just
building
up
to
the
fact
that
this
is
traditional,
well
recognized
doctrine
and
there's
been
--
and
there's
been
a
sudden
change?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
would
the
boat
get
up
there?
does
it
just
jump
over
the
10
feet?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
then
that
would
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
that
would
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
the
chief
justice
is
indicating,
i
think,
this
concerns
who
owns
the
bed;
and
that
is
different
from
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
and
--
and
some
of
the
answers
you
gave
to
justice
alito
about
the
purposes
and
the
reasons
for
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
are
quite
different,
really,
than
for
the
considerations
we
have
about
riparian
ownership.
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
can
be
controlled
by
the
united
states
for
many
purposes,
but
that
is
concurrent
with
a
separate
document
--
doctrine
for
underlying
ownership
of
the
bed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
the
test
for
navigable
waters
is
the
same
in
each
case
as
to
the
whole
river.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
help
me
with
this?
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction
over
many
activities
such
as
boating
is
one
concept.
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
state
ownership
of
the
bed
serves
different
purposes.
are
the
--
are
the
boundaries
and
the
definitions
of
what
is
navigable
co-ex-extensive
and
parallel
and
precisely
the
same
in
each
case?
or,
on
the
other
hand,
are
there
some
cases
where
a
body
of
water,
say
the
falls,
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
but
not
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
bed
ownership
by
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and,
and
if
there
is
a
difference,
can
you
tell
me
a
case?
and
i
think
justice
scalia
basically
was
asking
this
earlier.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
is
conceded,
is
it
not,
that
with
--
if
we
rule
for
the
power
companies
in
this
case,
there
still
may
be
a
situations
in
which
these
waters
can
be
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
for
other
purposes
other
than
ownership
of
the
bed.
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
write
that
during
his
30-day
--
32-day
portage?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
were
your
--
what
were
your
other
four
points
you
were
going
to
give
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
general
rule,
when
a
state
enters
the
union,
it
takes
title
to
riverbeds
where
the
river
above
the
bed
is
navigable.
this
rule
follows
from
the
constitutional
principle
known
as
the
equal-footing
doctrine.
and
the
purpose
of
that
--
that
doctrine
is
to
allow
newly
admitted
states
the
same
ownership
and
control
of
riverbeds
that
the
original
13
states
enjoyed.
the
general
principles
of
the
original
13
states
and
newly
admitted
states
are
on
an
equal-footing.
navigability
is
determined
as
of
the
date
the
state
entered
the
union.
typically,
the
united
states
owned
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
before
statehood
and
it's
ownership
of
beds
within
the
state's
borders
passed
to
the
states
when
it
entered
the
union
and
there
are
qualifications
to
that
general
principle,
but
those
need
not
be
of
a
concern
for
this
brief
summary.
montana
became
a
state
in
1889.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
parts
or
segments
of
three
different
rivers
were
of
navigable,
as
the
law
defines
that
concept,
on
that
date.
the
three
rivers
or
to
be
more
precise,
the
--
the
rivers
whose
segments
are
in
question
here
are
the
missouri
river,
the
madison
river
and
the
clark
fork.
on
portions
of
each
of
these
rivers,
all
--
and
they're
all
in
montana,
a
power
company,
which
is
the
petitioner
here,
owns
and
operates
dams
or
related
hydroelectric
facilities
and
the
company
is
ppl
montana,
the
petitioner
in
the
case.
for
a
number
of
years,
ppl
paid
rent
to
the
united
states
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
paying
for
use
of
lands
that
included
the
riverbeds
that
the
united
states
owned.
then
in
2003,
parents
of
montana
school
children
filed
a
suit
arguing
that
the
beds
belong
to
the
state.
this
suit
was
later
filed
and
the
suit
--
and
the
state
argued
that
rent
should
be
paid
to
it
because
it,
the
state
of
montana,
owns
the
beds
under
the
equal-footing
doctrine.
the
montana
supreme
court
held
the
rivers
were
navigable
at
the
time
of
statehood
and
so
they
awarded
judgment
to
the
state.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
for
the
reasons
explained
in
today's
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
montana
court
is
reversed.
the
principle
error
of
the
montana
court
was
in
its
failure
to
adhere
to
this
court's
precedents
on
whether
and
when
certain
segments
of
the
river
must
be
deemed
nonnavigable.
this
court's
well-settled
rule
that
navigability
can
be
assessed
on
a
segment
by
segment
basis,
a
rule
given
too
little
weight
by
the
montana
court,
is
based
on
practical
considerations
and
these
include
the
fact
that
physical
conditions
may
very
significantly
along
the
whole
length
of
a
river.
this
court's
segment
by
segment
approach
applies
to
the
river
segments
here.
the
case
involves
riverbed
parcels
and
segments
of
the
rivers
where
it
is
doubtful,
the
state
can
establish
navigability,
even
if
there
might
exist
some
riverbed
parcels
too
small
for
the
river
segments
above
them
to
merit
separate
treatment,
the
parcels
here,
in
particular,
the
portions
of
the
riverbed
under
the
great
falls
reach
of
the
missouri
river
are
not
so
small
as
to
be
worthless
or
in
administrable
and
there
are
other
points
as
well.
explorers
at
some
places,
particularly
at
the
great
falls
reach,
could
not
continue
travel
by
river
without
inland
portage.
portage
generally
demonstrates
the
river
waters
cannot
be
navigated.
the
state
court
did
not
give
the
necessary
consideration
to
this
factor
in
considering
navigability.
the
state
court
was
mistaken
too
in
the
weight
it
placed
on
evidence
of
present-day
primarily
recreational
use
of
the
madison
river.
as
the
opinion
explains,
the
reliance
was
not
supported
by
the
necessary
findings.
finally,
montana
files
its
claim
for
riverbed
rents
over
a
century
after
the
first
ppl's
dams
was
built
upon
the
riverbeds.
today's
opinion
notes
that
the
state's
long
failure
to
assert
title
is
some
additional
evidence
that
the
river
segments
here
involved
were
deemed
nonnavigable
for
purposes
of
the
equal-footing
doctrine.
the
judgment
of
the
montana
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded,
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
