justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
independent
counsel
would
not
be
covered.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
--
you
know,
a
counsel
appointed
because
--
to
show
that
the
administration
is
disinterested
in
this
prosecution
and
you
get
independent
counsel,
the
attorney
general
says:
i
will
not
interfere
with
him.
the
president
says:
i
will
not
interfere
with
him.
then
him
you
can
sue
without
any
immunity,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
he's
not
working
in
close
coordination.
he's
not
subject
to
supervision.
the
whole
purpose
of
an
independent
counsel
is
to
eliminate
supervision.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
weren't
the
prison
guards
who
were
--
who
were
suable
in
richardson,
weren't
they
suable
under
1983
as
acting
under
color
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
--
the
whole
issue
would
have
been
a
nonissue
if
they
--
if
they
couldn't
be
sued.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
the
--
the
two
should
go
pari
passu,
as
we
say,
that
if
you
can
be
sued
for
acting
under
color
of
law
you
ought
to
have
the
defenses
that
people
who
were
acting
with
legal
authority
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
seem
to
assume
or
to
acknowledge
or
to
concede
that
market
forces
do
not
operate
for
government
employment,
that
all
government
employees
are
doing
it
out
of
love?
i
mean,
why
does
market
force
eliminate
this
defense
for
somebody
who
is
an
employee
of
a
private
company
but
not
for
somebody
who
is
an
employee
of
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
year-long
employment
is
not
employment?
if
i
accepted
a
government
job
for
only
a
year,
i'm
not
a
government
employee?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
working
as
an
employee.
he's
hired
for
one
year.
it's
a
one-year
contract.
why
does
that
make
him
not
an
employee?
or
is
it
the
fact
that
he's
a
lawyer?
and
all
lawyers
have
a
certain
independent
responsibility,
they
can't
do
some
things
that
government
superiors
might
tell
them
to
do,
right?
so
are
you
going
to
say
all
lawyers
are
--
are
--
cannot
plead
qualified
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
it
even
easier
then.
i
thought
the
attorney
thing
would
help
you,
but
if
he's
not
even
functioning
as
an
attorney,
he's
functioning
as
a
government
investigator.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
employed
him
for
a
year,
exclusive
employment,
no
other
clients,
you
would
say
that
is
a
different
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
saying
a
year,
in
fact
364
days,
okay?
and
the
deal
was,
you
are
going
to
work
for
us
and
nobody
else.
you
have
no
other
clients.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
how
do
you
look
at
them?
does
that
case
come
out
the
same
way
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
everybody
takes
a
position
to
make
money
for
profit.
how
many
government
employees
work
for
free?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
--
he
may
be,
i
guess.
but
assume
he's
not.
he's
just
a
lawyer
whose
been
hired
for
364
days
to
work
for
nobody
but
the
government.
and
you
still
say
that
he
has
no
immunity
in
what
he
does
to
investigate
for
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
two
years,
though?
three
years?
i'm
a
lawyer
who--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
a
lawyer
who
enters
a
contract
for
life
with
this
government
to
investigate,
at
that
point
does
he
get
the
immunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
still
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
should
say
that
section
1983
didn't
exist,
that's
your
answer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
there's
a
lot
of
bad,
cowardly
legal
advice
being
given
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don't
really
know
that,
but
you
don't
know
the
opposite,
either,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
the
rule
about
malice
being
--
being
the
criterion
of
liability,
that
applied
not
just
to
--
not
just
private
lawyers
but
to
government
lawyers
as
well,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
we
are
going
to
be
historically
faithful,
we
should
deny
any
qualified
immunity
to
government
lawyers,
or
expand
the
government
immunity
to
--
for
government
lawyers,
so
they
can
do
anything
so
long
as
it's
not
malicious?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
the
--
history,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
told
you
that
all
the
lawyers
at
the
department
of
justice
are
regarded
as
being
employed
at
will,
and
that
all
of
them
can
be
fired?
do
you
think
the
rest
of
them
don't
--
don't
have
any
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
that's
going
to
be
disappointing
news
for
all
those
attorneys.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
--
if
he
did
the
same
thing
for
a
private
company
--
he
could
do
the
same
thing
for
a
private
company.
say,
you
know,
you're
going
to
get
fired
unless
you
substantiate
your
story
by
bringing
the
stuff
out
of
your
house.
that
wouldn't
be
a
search,
an
unlawful
search;
right?
it
could
have
happened
in
the
private
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
very
little
that
is
uniquely
governmental.
i
mean,
my
goodness,
if
we
denied
immunity
to
all
those
acts
that
are
not
uniquely
governmental,
there
would
be
very
little
immunity,
i'm
afraid.
