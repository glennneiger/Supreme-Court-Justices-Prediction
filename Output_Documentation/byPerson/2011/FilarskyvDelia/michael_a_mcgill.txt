mr.
michael
a
mcgill
oh.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
has
not
demonstrated
a
historical
basis
of
immunity
at
common
law
for
somebody
in
mr.
filarsky's
situation.
the
petitioner
has
also
not
shown
that
the
immunity's
purposes
also
serve
mr.
filarsky's
situation
here.
i
want
to
put
those
two
issues
aside.
we
will
talk
about
that
in
a
minute,
but
i
want
to
address
the
issue
that
has
been
most
--
discussed
the
most,
which
is
the
petitioner's
test.
the
test
that
the
petitioner
proposes
that
this
court
adopt
is
one
that
is
very
difficult
to
use.
the
test
is
simply
whether
the
individual
is
temporarily
retained
in
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
government
employee,
considering
three
factors.
the
three
factors
are:
one,
the
nature
of
the
role
performed;
the
close
supervision
and/or
coordination
with
a
government
official--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
our
test
is
richardson.
i
think
richardson
is
the
correct
analysis.
the
court
starts
with
looking
at
a
historical
basis
of
an
immunity
at
common
law
and
then
from
there
works
through
the
policy
reasons.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
a
part-time
employee--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
he
would
be
--
he
would
receive
harlow
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
absolutely.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no,
i
don't
think
so.
any
time
--
like
in
mr.
filarsky's
situation,
mr.
filarsky
is
a
for-profit
law
firm.
he
sells
himself
as
an
experienced
professional
in
the
field
providing
legal
services
to
the
city
of--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
the
court
has
made
a
distinction
in
its
past
decisions
about
functions
that
are
integral
to
the
judicial
process.
so
when
you
talk
about
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor,
that's
a
special
function.
that's
sort
of
a
different
situation.
but
never
has
there
been
an
immunity
for
an
attorney
just
because
they
happen
to
be
an
attorney.
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
that.
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
respondent
nor
the
seven
amici
have--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--no
i
would
say
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
because
he's
a--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
they
passed
a
resolution
to
hire
him
and
his
firm
to
provide
those
services
on
a
temporary
basis,
or
a
basis
of
six
months.
but
he
still
is
an
outside
attorney
and
he's
probably
got
--
has
other
clients
and
has
other
interests
involved.
and
the
situation
is
different
--
it's
an
entirely
different
system
when
you
have
a
private
law
firm
operating
for
profit,
contracts--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
as
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
if
--
if
that
individual
is
--
is
working
as
an
employee
of
the
city--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
our
position
here
in
this
case
is
that
mr.
filarsky
was
not
necessarily
acting
in
a
role
of
an
attorney,
he
was
functioning
as
an
internal
affairs
investigator.
it
is
doubtfully
that
he
would
have
maintained
an
attorney-client
relationship
with
the
city
given
that
he
was
hired
for
a
chance
to
conduct
a
fact
finding--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--but
he
has
other
clients
and
he
works
for
profit,
then
he
operates
in
a
different
system.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
he
is
not
subject
to
the
same
system--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--if
they
employed
him
for
longer
than
a
year?
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well,
i
think
then
that
that's
--
that's
where
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
policy
considerations.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
if
he's
taking
that
position
for
that
term,
that
one-year
period
to
make
money
for
profit,
and
the
next
year
he's
going
to
work
for
somebody
else--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--but
he
may
be
in
that
instance
trying
to
form
a
relationship
with
that
municipality,
and
enter
into
a
longer
term
contract.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
absolutely.
he
gets
no
immunity
in
that
situation.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
the
longer
you
go.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no,
because
there's--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--there
is
no
historical
basis
for
immunity.
it
just
wasn't
there.
for
that
function
that
mr.
filarsky
was
providing,
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
it.
and
typically
that
would
end
the
court's
question.
that
would
end
the
inquiry.
you
only
get
to
the
policy
consideration--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
the
distinction
really
is,
if
you
are
a
private
actor
you
are
subject
to
a
different
set
of
rules.
you
are
subject
to
the
market
pressures
and
the
competition
that
are
going
to
correct
your
behavior
and
are
going
to
satisfy
the
same
purposes
that
immunity
provides.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
as
a
historical
basis,
there
does
not
appear
to
be
immunity
for
private
prosecutors.
however,
this
court
over
the
years
has
provided
immunity
for
the
judicial--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--i
think
that
that's
a
much
closer
call.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
but
i
think
it's
a
much
closer
call,
because
he
was
engaged
in
a
prosecutorial
function,
which
this
court
over
the
years
has.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
right.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
an
immunity
question,
it's
more
of
a
liability
question.
because
it
very
well
may
be--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--but
i
think
what
it
is,
the
difference
there,
there
you
have
an
attorney
just
providing
advice
which
is
different
than
what
happened
here,
where
you
actually
have
an
attorney
engaged--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--if
the
attorney
under
those
circumstances
could
be
held
liable
for
a
constitutional
violation
for
simply
giving
advice
and
he
happens
to
be
a
private
attorney
working
for
profit,
then
he
wouldn't
have
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--i
think
the
answer's
the
same.
if
somehow
under
those
circumstances
the
attorney
could
be
held
liable
for
giving
that
advice,
and
he's
a
private
attorney,
and
he
doesn't
pass
the
richardson
test,
then
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
there
is
no
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
there
is
certainly
no
--
there
is
no
historical
basis
of
immunity
just
for
giving
legal
advice.
the
petitioner
hasn't
pointed
this
court
to
any
firmly
rooted
tradition
of
an
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
mr.
filarsky
is
a
private
individual,
he
doesn't
need
qualified
immunity.
you
know,
richardson
is
decided
in
1977
but
in
2003
the
ninth
circuit
issued
its
decision
in
gonzales
v.
spencer.
and
in
gonzales
v.
spencer
the
court
held
that
private
attorneys
like
mr.
filarsky
don't
need
immunity;
they
don't
get
immunity.
so
the
law
in
the
land
since
2003--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--but
for
nearly
a
decade
the
law
within
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
that
private
attorneys
don't
receive
immunity.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
and
that
--
the
fact
that
is,
is
that
mr.
filarsky
knew
going
into
that
--
that
investigation
that
he
wouldn't
have
immunity
for
anything
he
--
he
did.
and
it
didn't
deter
him;
it
didn't
make
him--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
because
he,
in
light
of
the
threats
that
--
that
he
received,
he
still
went
forward
with
the
--
what
was
deemed
to
be
an
unconstitutional
search.
so
the
--
the
policy
purposes
of,
you
know,
wanting
to
prevent
unwarranted
timidity
and
deterring
talented
candidates
from
working
with
the
government--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
the--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
mr.
filarsky
said,
and
this
is
what
he
said
on
the
record;
it's
in
the
transcripts
in
the
joint
appendix,
is
that
he
is
issuing
the
order
on
behalf
of
the
department.
that's
--
that's
what
he
says.
and
there
was
some
--
some
discussion
back
and
forth
between
mr.
delia's
attorney
and
mr.
filarsky,
and
that's
what
led
to
the
formalization
of
--
of
the
order.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
don't.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
so
why
did
the
petitioner
or
respondent
not
cross-appeal.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
think
it
was
--
that's
sort
of
the
law
of
the
case,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
so
we
--
we
obviously
didn't
want
to
appeal
that.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
right.
i
--
i
--
my
personal
opinion
and
our
position
has
been
is
that
it
--
the
law
was
clearly
established
on
that.
why
the
decision
was
made
not
to
cross-appeal
on
that,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure.
but--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--i
--
i
think
it's
pretty
well
known
that
the
house
is--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--yes,
i
do
because
it
--
it
--
certainly
mr.
filarsky
didn't
have
any
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
mr.
delia
was
lying
or
was
being
dishonest.
he
certainly
didn't
have
probable
cause.
he
had
a
hunch.
and
then,
that's
what
said,
i
--
i
--
he
said
it
as
--
at
the
--
during
the
interview
that
i
--
i
don't
necessarily
know
that
you
are
lying,
i
just
--
i
want
to
see
if
you
are.
so,
you
know,
the
investigation
turned
from
wanting
to
see
whether
mr.
delia
was
off
work
on
false
pretenses
into,
well,
i
don't
have
anything
there,
so
let
me
just
see
if
he
is
lying,
just
for
the
sake
of
it.
and
that's
when
they
ended
up
issuing
that
order.
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation
if
perhaps
you
could
argue
that
they
had
a
reasonable
suspicion,
or
had
some
cause
to
search
his
house,
but
here
they
didn't.
so
i
think
it
is
under
those
facts
clearly
established.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that's
right.
there
was
not
qualified
immunity
at
common
law,
but
there
was
absolute
immunity.
and
in
--
in
their
--
i
mean,
i
can't
go
back
and
think
about
all
the
different
immunities
that
may
or
may
not
have
existed,
but
i
--
i
do
know
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
to
bring
forth
--
a
firm
--
tradition.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
it's
not
going
to
create
new
immunities.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
right.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
it
did.
that
that
--
that
good
faith
defense
applied.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well,
that
--
that's
what
this
court
would
have
to
do.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
it
would
have
to
basically
expand
what
a
common
law
defense.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well,
it
would
result
in
this
court
having
to
expand
that
immunity
that
it
expanded
in
harlow
to
private
individuals.
and
our
position
is
that
because
a
private
individual,
like
mr.
filarsky,
as
a
market
participant,
the
purposes
of
immunity
aren't
served.
they
are
just
simply
aren't
not
needed.
and
i
was
mentioning
earlier
about--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
there
probably
would
be
some
distraction.
that
would
be
inevitable,
but
it
would
be
no
different
than
the
distraction
that
the
government
would
face
when
a
private
attorney
is
sued
for
any
number
of
claims,
malpractice
or
you
know,
some
state
law
violation.
and
to
say
that
the
distraction
that
the
government
is
going
to
faced
based
on
just
what
is
probably
a
small
sliver
of
the
big
pie,
which
is
you
know,
1983
litigation,
is
pretty
speculative.
and
of
course,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
the
--
the
government
employer
itself
can
still
be
liable
under
monell.
so
even
though
the
immunity
may
kick
in
and
the
individuals
may
get
off,
or
may
not
have
to
stand
suit,
it
--
there
are
still
occasions
when
the
government
is
still
going
to
be
there,
so
that
distraction
is
still
going
to
exist.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
well,
i
don't
think
he
would
be
liable.
i
don't
think
under
that
situation
he
would
have
participated
in
the--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--no.
i
don't
know
that
--
that
he
would
be
liable
under
section
1983.
but
if
he
were,
and
he
were
a
private
lawyer,
he
would
not
have
qualified
immunity.
he
would
still
be
under
the
same
richardson
test
where
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
it,
and
because
he's
a
private
individual
working
under
--
you
know,
working
ing
for
profit
and
subject
to
market
pressures,
he
wouldn't--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--if
he
were
purely
a
volunteer
it
--
it
very
well
might
be
a
different
answer,
because
some
of
those
policy
concerns
that
--
that
richardson
talked
about
and
discussed
may
not
be
present.
so
you
have
to
apply
the
test
to
the
situation
you
have
before
you.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
don't
know
that
50
percent
makes
a
difference.
and
earlier,
we
were
discussing
about
the
1
year
or
the
2
year
and
so
forth,
the
length
of
the
contract.
i
don't
think
those
things
necessarily
make
a
difference.
the
point
is
whether
mr.
filarsky
was
undertaking
that
representation
or
that
role
in
a
manner
that
made
him
subject
to
other
regular
market
pressures.
if
he
was
performing
a
function
and
competing
against
other
lawyers
or
other
investigators
performing
that
same
function,
then
the
point
is
there,
you
know,
he
isn't
going
to
be
as
timid,
because
he's
want
--
going
to
want
to
do
a
good
job.
and
the
same
policy
concerns
that
are
present
for
a
government
lawyer
aren't
there
for
him
as
a
private
individual.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
don't
think
that
it
would.
in
other
words,
is
the
question
whether
or
not
if
we
abolished
the
merit
system
or
civil
service
system,
would
qualified
immunity
still
be
needed?
i
think
if
that
were
the
question,
that
--
well,
that's
a
tough
question
to
answer.
but
it
very
well
may
not
be,
because
part
of
the
decision
in
richardson
here
was
--
it
was
--
they
were
operating
within
a
different
system.
private
versus
public.
and
if
you
start
to
make
the
public
system
look
more
like
a
private
system,
then
it
very
well
may
be
that
immunity
won't
be
needed
at
all.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
think
that
that's
correct,
but
when
you
have
a
civil
service
system,
a
merit
system,
it's
not
as
easy
to
correct
behavior
as
it
would
be
for,
say,
a
private
person.
for,
like
mr.
filarsky,
if
he
was
not
performing
at
the
level
that
the
city
of
rialto
had
hoped,
he
could
be
replaced,
and
quite
easily.
for
a
government
employee,
though,
there
are
obviously
the
civil
service
protections,
and
it's
not
so
easy
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
pardon
me?
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i'm
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
whether--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--well,
i
--
i
know
that
some
subsections
of
lawyers
within
a
government
can
be
represented,
so
they
--
they
very
well
may
have
some
protection.
but
maybe
it's
not
quite
to
the
extent
that
more
of
the
rank
and
file
would
have.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
no,
because
they
would
--
they
would
get
it
under
harlow.
they
would
--
they
would
have
immunity
under
harlow.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
they
--
they
very
well
may
be.
and
it
may
be
for
me
to
say
that
maybe
they
shouldn't
have
immunity;
it's
not
needed.
but
at
this
point,
the
law
is
in
harlow
that
they
would
receive
it.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
think
that
the
answer
would
be
the
same;
in
that
they
very
well
may
not
need
qualified
immunity
because
those
pressures
and
those
concerns
underlying
immunity
aren't
there.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
just
want
to
go
back
and
talk
about
the
petitioner's
test
a
little
bit,
too,
because
the
court
had
some
concerns
about
it
and
i
share
those
same
concerns.
and
that's
that
the
test
requires
a
factual
analysis.
you
know,
being
temporarily
retained
in
close
coordination
and
supervision.
those
are
highly
factual
questions
that
aren't
going
to
bode
well
for
early
resolution
of
a
case.
and
a
--
the
lawyer
is
going
to
be
able
to
plead
around
that
test
very
easily
and
take
the
case
into
full-blown
litigation
and
discovery
and
so
forth.
so
that
--
that
test
is
problematic.
in
addition,
as
i
understand
it,
the
test
is
going
to
be
extended
well
beyond
attorneys.
the
test
results
and
anybody
working
for
the
government
--
under,
you
know,
close
coordination
or
supervision,
whatever
that
means,
is
going
to
get
immunity.
so
that
is
well
beyond
attorneys,
to
anybody.
anybody
who
contracts
with
the
government
and
meets
that
factual
test
is
now
going
to
have
immunity.
and
that's
something
--
that's
a
huge
step
that
this
court,
you
know,
should
not
take,
especially
when
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
it
and
the
policy
concerns
are
not
present.
but
even
if
you
apply
that
test
to
mr.
filarsky,
under
these
facts,
mr.
filarsky
would
not
have
immunity.
he
wasn't
temporarily
retained.
he
worked
for
the
city
of
rialto
for
14
years
as
a
business,
for
a
profit.
he
had
many
clients,
and
the
city
of
rialto
was
one
of
them.
it
wasn't
that
he
was
temporarily
retained.
so
he
doesn't
even
meet
that
element
of
the
petitioner's
test.
mr.
filarsky
was
not--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--the
--
the
concerns
about
there
being
a
factual
inquiry?
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
i
don't
think
so.
as
an
attorney,
i
would
have
to
certify
in
a
pleading
that
the
relationship
between
the
person
i'm
suing
and
the
government
--
so
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
information
put
forth
in
the
pleading
that
would
establish
that,
and
i
don't
know
that
one
could
simply
make
up
state
action
for
purposes
of
pursuing
a
1983
action.
so
it
--
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
factual
inquiry,
but
i
don't
think
it's
as
great
or
nearly
as
great
as
the
temporarily
retained
or
close
coordination
components
to
the
--
to
the
petitioner's
test.
mr.
filarsky
was
not
performing
a
function
that
is
uniquely
governmental.
investigating
workplace
misconduct
is
not
a
governmental
function,
or
it's
not
a
prototypical
governmental
function.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
correct.
but
it
was
under
the
auspices
of
a
workplace
investigation,
if
you
will.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
executing
a
--
a
formal
search
by
the
government
is
something
--
that's
a
role
that
the
government
performs,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
--
i
wouldn't
equate,
you
know,
executing
a
search
with
what
occurred
here.
well,
let
me
restate
that,
i
guess.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that--
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
--mr.
filarsky,
the
function,
the
role
that
he
was
performing
was
that
of
an
internal
affairs
investigator.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
it
could
have.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
it
very
well
could
have.
and
that's
my
point,
is
that
what
mr.
filarsky
did
in
his
role
was
not
uniquely
governmental.
he
wasn't
performing
a
governmental
function.
mr.
michael
a
mcgill
thank
you.
