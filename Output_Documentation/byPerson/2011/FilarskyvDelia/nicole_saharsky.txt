ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
may
assert
qualified
immunity
on
the
same
terms
as
the
fire
department
officials,
because
he
was
working
side-by-side
with
them
and
under
their
supervision
on
a
personnel
investigation.
and
this
is
really
exactly
the
situation
that
the
court
reserved
and
anticipated
in
richardson,
that
when
you
have
a
situation
where
private
and
government
workers
work
closely
together
and
you
deny
qualified
immunity
to
the
private
person,
it
would
directly
affect
the
ability
of
the
government
employees
to
do
their
jobs.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
there's
a
very
close
working
relationship--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--he
likely
would
have
qualified
immunity.
the
closeness
of
the
relationship
is
very
apparent
here,
but
as
a
general
matter
it
is
our
position
that
when
people
are
doing
the
business
of
government,
private
people,
can
be
sued
under
section
1983
or
bivens,
there
should
be
a
presumption
in
favor
of
qualified
immunity.
and
richardson
is
not
to
the
contrary,
because
that
is
a
fairly
unique
case
in
which
the
private
prison
was
so
removed
from
the
day-to-day
workings
of
government
officials
that
it
would
not
have
furthered
the
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
to
give
qualified
immunity
to
the
folks
in
those
situations.
so
what
we're
talking
about--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
i
mean,
several
members
of
the
court
said
that
in
richardson.
and
the
--
the
court's
opinion
really
talked
about
the
uniqueness
of
the
situation
there,
that
tennessee
was
doing
something
really
out
on
the
forefront
in
terms
of
giving
the
day-to-day
decisionmaking
to
the
folks
in
that
situation
in
the
private
prison,
and
only
checking
up.
there
was
monitoring,
you
know,
annually.
it
was
really
not
much
ongoing
monitoring
at
all.
and
the
--
the
richardson
court,
you
know,
found
that
to
be
a
unique
situation,
but
it
distinguished
the
situation
that
you
have
here,
where--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
we
understand
the
court's
discussion
of
market
forces
to
be
really
important
in
the
context
there,
where
you
don't
have
individuals
who
are
working
closely
with
government.
the
court
needed
and
the
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
wouldn't
be
served
in
terms
of
deterrence
and
in
ensuring
good
government
decision
making.
but
the
market
forces
discussion
was
the
court
reassuring
itself
in
those
circumstances
that
there
would
still
be
private
prison
companies
that
would
be
willing
to
take
on
the
business
of
government
and
would
be
able
to
do
it,
you
know,
consistent
with
the
constitution.
so
we
don't
understand
the
court
to
have
been
setting
out
market
forces
as
a
test
for
qualified
immunity,
because,
as
your
question
seems
to
suggest,
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion,
any
time
a
private
person
is
being
hired
by
the
government,
you
could
say,
well,
there
is
a
market
for
the
person,
couldn't
someone
else
fill
those
shoes,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so
we
think
the
court's
market
forces
decision
was
fairly
confined
to
what
the
court
itself
described
as
the
unique
situation
in
richardson.
and
the
court's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--we
do
think
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
the
attorney
in
this
situation
has
private
clients
that
that
attorney
can
work
for,
whereas
the
private
prison
company
really
could
only
work
for
the
government.
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
i
mean,
that
was
an
important
part
of
the
firm's
business.
but
mr.
filarsky
is
trained
as
an
employment
lawyer
and
has,
you
know,
broad
training
and
expertise
in
employment-related
matters.
so
there
is
certainly
other
work
that
could
be
done.
but,
you
know,
we
thought
the
core
of
the
court's
decision
in
richardson
was
really
focusing
on
the
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
and
whether
they
would
be
furthered
by
giving
them
to
the
private
prison
and
the
private
prison
guards.
and
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
we
thought
that
the
market
forces
inquiry
was
particularly
relevant
to
answering
the
qualified
immunity
question.
i
am
just
explaining
that
the
way
we
read
the
court's
opinion
in
richardson,
which
obviously
the
members
of
this
court
are
the
experts
on,
is
that
the
court
was
looking
to
market
forces
to
reassure
itself
after
it
determined
that
the
purposes
of
qualified
immunity
just
wouldn't
be
served
by
giving
an
organization
that
was
so
far
removed
from
the
day-to-day
workings
of
government
the
protection
of
qualified
immunity.
the
court
just
--
the
market
forces
really
was
just
something
unique
to
that
case.
and
what
we
think
is
the
most
relevant
is
what
the
court
started
with
both
in
the
decision
in
wyatt
and
in
richardson,
which
is,
is
it
necessary
to
give
qualified
immunity
here
to
make
sure
there
is
principled
and
fearless
government
decisionmaking.
it's
the
business
of
government
that's
important.
and
in
this
case,
although
petitioner
is
an
attorney
who
has
his
own
fiduciary
obligations,
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
when
he
was
threatened
during
the
conduct
of
this
personnel
investigation
that
that
is
something
that
potentially
could
chill
his
behavior.
and
to
the
extent
that
he
cabins
the
advice
that
he
gave
to
the
fire
department
officials,
that
affects
the
ability
of
government
to
do
their
job.
and
i
might
give
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
saying--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
saying
that
an
attorney
is
in
a
difficult
position
there,
and
it's
the
same
position
that
a
government
attorney
would
be
in,
and
the
court
has
extended
qualified
immunity
to
government
attorneys
who
are
in
this
position,
either
giving
legal
advise,
like
in
the
burns
case,
or
serving
as
prosecutors.
and
there
is
just
no
difference
when
he
is
operating
in
this
case
that
would
make
him
distinguishable
from
a
government
attorney.
to
answer
another
suggestion,
i
think,
in
your
question,
the
court
talked
about
in
terms
of
deterrence
and
chilling,
making
sure
that
there
were
talented
candidates
who
wanted
to
take
on
the
position
of
government.
so
the
court
has
never
said,
you
know,
we
are
concerned
about
wiping
out
the
market
entirely.
it
said,
you
know,
if
there
is
a
segment
of
the
market
that
will
not
take
on
this
business
anymore,
that's
a
fairly
serious
problem
when
we
need
to
make
sure
that
the
government
business
is
done.
and
if
i
can
just
make
--
give
the
court
another
example
to,
perhaps
outside
the
context
of
this
case,
see
how
a
private
person
being
denied
qualified
immunity
would
affect
government
employees.
consider
a
fire
department
that
has
some
full-time
fire
department
personnel
and
also
some
volunteer
firefighters.
when
they
are
working
together
and
fighting
a
fire,
you
don't
want
the
volunteer
firefighter
thinking:
should
i
break
down
this
door?
i
may
face
personal
liability.
you
want
him
to
make
fearless
decisions
because
whether
he
breaks
down
the
door
or
not
is
going
to
directly
affect
the
ability
of
the
other
folks
who
are
trying
to
go
into
those
homes,
trying
to
stop
the
fire,
to
do
their
jobs.
that
would
also
be
true
in
the
context
of
court
security.
the
united
states
marshal
service
sometimes
uses
private
security
guards
and
we
have
direct
supervision
and
control
over
them,
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
is
just
difficult
in
the
fire
department
situation,
even
if
there
is
an
all-volunteer
force,
that
there
wouldn't
be
some
type
of
direct
supervision
by
the
mayor,
by
the
city
council,
et
cetera.
you
know,
that's
--
particularly
in
the
local
government
situation,
those
folks
would
tend
to
work
fairly
closely
together.
it
is,
in
the
case
of
deterrence
and
wanting
fearless
decisionmaking,
a
primary
concern
that
we
have
about
protecting
government.
but
we
need
to
protect
the
individuals
to
protect
government.
so
we
do
need
to
make
sure
that
their
decisions
aren't
chilled,
that
persons
like
petitioner
are
willing
to
take
on
representation
of
this
kind.
and
the
ninth
circuit
suggestion
that
no
private
person
should
be
--
should
get
qualified
immunity,
even
when
they
are
doing
the
day-to-day
business
of
government,
is
just
one
that
can't
be
reconciled
with
this
court's
decisions
in
wyatt
and
richardson.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
it
wasn't
clearly
established
law.
i
understand
that
it's
a
fairly
difficult
fourth
amendment
question.
but
as
you
say,
it
wasn't
teed
up
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
a
petition
on
this
question.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
you
know,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
found
it
wasn't
clearly
established,
it
probably
wouldn't
make
sense
for
the
court
to
address
it.
one
thing
i
might
point
out
along
those
lines
is
that
both
the
district
court
made
a
finding
on
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
finding
in
it's
opinion,
and
this
was
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
wasn't
clearly
established,
was
because
there
was
no
attendant
threat
in
terms
of
employment
consequences
to
respondent
in
this
case.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
in
terms
of
the
argument,
petitioner
conceded
throughout
the
litigation
that
he
was
a
state
actor.
in
the
complaint,
respondent
actually
suggested
he
was
an
employee
of
the
city.
in
terms
of
whether
he
was
asserting
the
authority
of
state
law,
it
does
seem
fairly
clear
that
he
was
asserting
the
authority
of
state
law
here.
thank
you.
