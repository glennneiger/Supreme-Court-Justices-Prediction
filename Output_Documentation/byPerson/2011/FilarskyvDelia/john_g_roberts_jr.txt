we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-1018,
filarsky
v.
delia.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
test
--
and
this
is,
i
think
goes
broader
than
the
articulation
of
the
test
--
doesn't
give
this
private
attorney
much
assurance
by
itself.
it's
sort
of
a
multifactor,
is
he
is
coordinating,
is
he
under
the
supervision,
is
he
really
doing
public
service?
i
mean,
if
the
idea
is
to
give
him
sufficient
breathing
room
so
he
doesn't
stop,
and
when,
as
in
this
case,
he
is
threatened
that
we
are
going
to
sue
you
if
you
do
this,
he
has
to
think,
well
now,
am
i
being
supervised
by
the
government?
am
i
coordinating
with
the
government?
or
i
--
am
i
telling
them
what
--
it
--
the
--
the
test
itself
undermines
the
asserted
purpose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

lawyers
--
lawyers
are
not
supposed
to
be
cowed
by
the
exigencies
of
the
situation.
we're
worried
in
qualified
immunity
with
protecting
governmental
actors,
to
make
sure
they
will
feel
comfortable
doing
the
right
thing
rather
than
being
intimidated
in
the
situation
we
had
here.
lawyers
have
that
professional
obligation
in
the
first
place.
so
why
does
a
lawyer
need
the
--
the
defense
of
qualified
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
we'll
hear
from
ms.
saharsky
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
all
right.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
they
don't
work
closely
together
at
all
and
it's
just
this
one
fellow
conducting
the
investigation,
he
wouldn't
have
qualified
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
no,
i'm
wrong,
or
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
it's
a
100
percent
purely
volunteer
fire
department?
i
mean,
the
town,
whatever,
contracts,
out-sources,
whatever,
but
it's
just
run
by
volunteers.
is
your
answer
the
same?
i'm
trying
to
get
at
your
point
about
they're
working
with
or
coordinating
with
government
employees.
and
your
argument
seems
a
little
derivative.
you
are
saying
the
whole
point
is
to
protect
the
government
employees
and
you
have
to
have
qualified
immunity
for
the
non-employee
to
do
that.
but
does
your
argument
apply
when
there
are
no
government
employees
around?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mcgill.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
case--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
case
highlights,
i
think
is
a
very
good
example
of
why
the
lawyer
ought
to
have
qualified
immunity.
i
mean
this
is
a
case
where
it
looks
like
there's
a
lot
of
threatening
and
bullying
going
on.
i
mean
the
lawyer
says,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
figure
out
a
way
to
name
you,
mr.
filarsky.
you're
issuing
an
illegal
order.
if
you
want
to
take
that
chance
go
right
ahead.
you
might
want
to
take
a
minute
to
think
about
it.
i
mean,
it
seems
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
for
which
qualified
immunity
was
developed.
we
want
filarsky
to
give
what
he
--
do
what
he
thinks
is
the
right
thing
in
this
situation.
we
don't
want
him
to
be
worried
about
the
fact
that
he
might
be
sued.
and
you
have
a
lawyer
here
saying,
well,
if
you
do
that
i'm
going
to
sue
you.
so
filarsky
naturally,
or
some
lawyer
in
that
situation
is
going
to
think,
wow,
do
i
really
want
to
run
that
risk.
isn't
that
exactly
why
we
have
qualified
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
easy
for
a
judge
to
say,
because
they
are
absolutely
immune--
[laughter]
--but
for
the
lawyer
who
is
sitting
there
and
saying
--
saying,
i'm
going
to
sue
you,
if
you
were
--
well,
you
are
a
lawyer,
and
you
are
sitting
in
that
situation,
isn't
that
going
to
enter
into
your
mind?
you
say,
well
sue
all
you
want;
i
don't
care;
this
is
the
right
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
know?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
he
had
--
he
had
the
chief
issue
the
order,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
the
chief
later
on
says,
well,
he
told
me
to
issue
the
order.
i
mean,
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
things
went
exactly
as
they
would
if
you
had
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
particularly
--
well,
even
if
--
the
reason
it's
an
issue
is
because
he
says,
look,
i
have
got
this
stuff
at
my
house.
that's
how
his
--
his
defense
is.
i
haven't
used
it;
i
have
got
the
insulation
there.
so
you
think
it's
still
clearly
established
that
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
city
to
say,
okay,
well,
show
it
to
us
if
you
want
to
use
that
as
your
defense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
filarsky
was
there,
you
know,
hired
to
help
the
fire
department
with
these
--
and
he
did
absolutely
nothing?
he
just
sits
there
and
watches.
the
battalion
chief
says,
i
want
to
do
this,
i
am
going
to
go
get
the
stuff;
you
bring
it
all
out.
and
he
just
--
he
just
sits
there,
doesn't
see
any
reason
to
offer
any
legal
advice
or
legal
opinion.
could
you
sue
him
under
1983?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really?
he
has
an
obligation
as
a
lawyer
to
speak
up
if
he
thinks
something
illegal
is
going
on,
that's
his
job,
and
he
doesn't
--
he
just
sits
there
quietly?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
for
profits,
i
--
the
significance
of
that
eludes
me.
sometimes
people
act
out
of,
you
know,
public
purpose,
and
particularly
in
these
sorts
of
situations
the
town
needs
a
lawyer
and
he
--
he's
helping
out.
what
--
if
he
were
purely
a
volunteer,
it
would
be
a
different
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
well
--
and
what
if
he
gives
the
city
a
discount?
he
is
working
for
half
--
half
his
fee,
because
it's
the
city.
he
wants
to
help
out,
but
he
can't
do
it
totally
for
free,
so
it's
50
percent
his
normal
rate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
all
of
these
--
are
all
of
these
objections
applicable
as
well
to
the
determination
of
whether
there
was
state
action
from
the
attorneys'
conduct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
--
your
objection
is
not
that
he
was
investigating
workplace
misconduct,
your
objection
was
that
he
was
ordering
people
to
tell
your
client
to
bring
out
stuff
that
was
in
his
house.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
telling
people
basically
either
execute
a
search
or
in
effect
executing
a
search,
that
is
a
uniquely
governmental
function.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case,
10-1018,
filarsky
versus
delia.
nicholas
delia,
a
firefighter
employed
by
the
city
of
rialto,
california,
became
ill
while
responding
to
a
toxic
spill.
when
delia
missed
three
weeks
of
work,
the
city
became
suspicious
of
his
absence,
particularly
after
he
was
seen
purchasing
building
supplies
from
a
home
improvement
store.
believing
that
delia
was
missing
work
to
do
construction
on
his
home
rather
than
because
of
an
illness,
the
city
initiated
a
formal
internal
affairs
investigation.
it
hired
steve
filarsky,
an
experienced
employment
lawyer
who
had
represented
the
city
in
several
previous
investigations
to
interview
delia.
during
the
interview,
delia
acknowledged
purchasing
the
building
materials,
but
denied
doing
any
work
on
his
home.
filarsky
suggested
that
the
investigation
could
be
wrapped
up
if
delia
could
produce
the
unused
materials.
he
asked
delia
to
allow
a
fire
department
official
to
enter
his
home
to
view
them.
when
delia
refused,
filarsky
instead
ordered
delia
to
bring
the
materials
out
of
his
home
to
show
them
to
the
official.
delia's
lawyer,
who
was
at
the
interview,
objected
that
the
order
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
repeatedly
threatened
to
bring
a
civil
rights
lawsuit
against
the
city
and
filarsky.
nonetheless,
after
the
interview
was
over,
fire
department
officials
went
with
delia
to
his
home
where
he
produced
the
unused
materials.
delia
then
sued
the
city,
its
fire
department,
several
fire
department
officials,
and
filarsky,
claiming
that
the
order
to
produce
the
materials
led
to
an
unreasonal
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
delia
sued
under
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
united
states
code.
section
1983
provides
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state
actors
who
violate
an
individual's
rights
under
federal
law.
now,
at
common
law,
those
who
work
on
behalf
of
the
government
were
afforded
certain
protections
from
liability
when
doing
so,
so
that
they
could
serve
the
government
without
undue
fear
of
personal
exposure.
our
decisions
have
accorded
similar
protection
to
state
actors
sued
under
1983
in
the
form
of
qualified
or
absolute
immunity
from
suit.
we've
reasoned
that
congress
meant
to
incorporate
these
protections
into
section
1983
when
it
enacted
that
law
in
1871.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
all
the
individuals
who
worked
for
the
fire
department
could
claim
immunity
from
suit,
but
not
filarsky,
because
he
was
a
private
attorney
and
not
a
full-time
government
employee.
we
granted
filarsky's
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
to
distinguish
between
city
employees
and
filarksy
for
purposes
of
immunity,
we
look
to
the
protections
that
common
law
afforded
to
those
exercising
government
power
in
1871.
understanding
those
protections
requires
an
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
government
at
that
time.
in
the
mid-19th
century,
government
was
smaller
in
both
size
and
reach,
had
fewer
responsibilities
and
operated
primarily
at
the
local
level.
local
governments
faced
tight
budget
constraints
and
generally
had
neither
the
need
nor
the
ability
to
maintain
an
established
bureaucracy
staff
by
professionals.
it
was
not
unusual
to
see
the
owner
of
the
local
general
store
step
behind
a
window
in
his
shop
to
don
his
postman's
hat
nor
would
it
be
a
surprise
to
find
on
a
trip
to
the
docks,
the
local
ferryman
collecting
fees
as
public
wharfmaster.
even
such
a
core
government
activity
as
criminal
prosecution
was
often
carried
out
by
a
mixture
of
public
employees
and
private
individuals
temporarily
serving
the
public.
at
the
time
section
1983
was
enacted,
private
lawyers
were
regularly
engaged
to
conduct
criminal
prosecutions
on
behalf
of
the
state.
abraham
lincoln
himself
accepted
several
such
appointments.
given
this
mixture
of
public
responsibility
and
private
pursuits,
characteristic
of
much
of
government
work
at
that
time,
it
is
not
surprising
that
protection
form
liability
at
common
law
did
not
vary,
depending
on
whether
the
individual
working
for
the
government
did
so
as
a
permanent
or
full-time
employee
or
on
some
other
basis.
now,
nothing
about
the
reasons
we
have
given
for
recognizing
immunity
under
section
1983,
counsels
against
carrying
forward
this
common
law
rule.
the
government
needs
its
workers
to
act
with
the
decisiveness
required
for
the
common
good
regardless
of
the
terms
on
which
those
workers
are
hired
and
because
those
who
work
for
the
government
on
only
in
occasionally
basis
will
be
free
to
choose
other
work,
work
that
will
not
expose
them
to
government
liability,
there's
an
increased
risk
that
the
best
candidates
will
avoid
government
engagements
if
they
are
not
given
the
same
protections
afforded
full-time
government
workers.
finally,
damages
suits
distract
individuals
temporarily
engaged
by
the
government
just
as
they
do
for
those
who
work
for
the
government
full-time
and
can
easily
embroil
other
government
employees
in
the
ongoing
litigation.
the
city
of
new
york
has
a
full-time
department
of
investigation,
staffed
by
full-time
employees
to
investigate
city
personnel
and
to
have
the
resources
to
pay
for
it.
the
city
of
rialto
has
neither
and
so
must
rely
on
the
occasional
services
of
private
individuals
such
as
mr.
filarsky.
there
is
no
reason
that
rialto's
internal
affairs
investigator
should
be
denied
the
qualified
immunity
enjoyed
by
the
ones
who
work
for
new
york.
we
hold
that
immunity
from
suit
under
section
1983
for
an
individual
retained
by
the
government
to
do
its
work
does
not
turn
on
the
nature
of
that
engagement.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
sotomayor
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
