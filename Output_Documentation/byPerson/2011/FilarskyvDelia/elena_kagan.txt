justice
elena
kagan
ms.
millett,
our
cases
have
said
that
we're
supposed
to
look
not
only
to
policy
but
also
to
history.
would
you
disagree
with
the
premise
that
a
person
in
your
client's
position
historically
would
have
had
at
most
an
actual
malice
--
a
malice
defense,
or
a
reasonable
cause
defense?
would
a
person
have
anything
more
than
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
wyatt,
we
said
that
that
was
a
very
different
kind
of
immunity
than
the
harlow
immunity,
and
we
said
historically
it
provided
no
basis
for
giving
harlow
immunity.
justice
elena
kagan
so
i
take
it
your
answer
is,
yes,
it
would
only
have
been
a
malice
defense,
but
that
doesn't
matter,
notwithstanding
wyatt.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
elena
kagan
doesn't
that
suggest
really
that
we
don't
have
a
historical
test
any
more,
that
really
all
we're
looking
to
is
policy
considerations?
justice
elena
kagan
wasn't
richardson
really
all
about
how
market
forces
would
make
immunity
unnecessary?
and
how
is
it
that
market
forces
play
any
different
role
in
this
case
than
they
do
in
richardson?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
market
forces
do
operate
differently
here,
or
is
it
basically
the
same
thing?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mcgill,
back
to
immunity.
what
--
one
thing
i
don't
understand
about
our
law
here.
you
say
there
was
no
historic
basis.
and
i
have
to
concede
that
that's
right.
seems
to
me
that
there's
--
there
was
only
a
malice
defense.
but
isn't
that
always
true
when
it
comes
to
a
--
a
private
person?
in
other
words,
of
course
there
is
no
historic
basis
for
qualified
immunity.
this
kind
of
immunity
was
developed
in
1970.
it's
sort
of
by
definition,
there
is
no
historic
basis
for
this
sort
of
immunity.
so
to
say
that
the
historic
basis
matters
is
really
to
say
that
private
people
never
get
harlow
immunity.
