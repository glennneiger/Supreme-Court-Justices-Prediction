g.

what
would
have
happened
if
abraham
lincoln
today
were
there,
and
i
gathered
what
happened
is
they
thought
the
local
prosecutor
was
good
but
lincoln
is
better.
so
we'll
let
lincoln
prosecute
this
case.
now
in
your
view
abraham
lincoln
would
not
have
had
immunity,
but
the
local
prosecutor
would
have.
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing,
by
the
way,
it
was
just
that
lincoln
had
a
better
reputation.
every
word
was
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
you,
in
your
opinion
am
i
--
when
i
write
this
opinion
i
could
say,
not
even
abraham
lincoln,
when
he
acted
as
a
public
prosecutor,
brought
in
for
the
occasion,
in
your
opinion
he
should
not
have
the
immunity
that
joe
jones,
the
local
prosecutor
would
have?
i'm
trying
to
get
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
investigatory
functions
they
don't
get
immunity,
so
if
lincoln
had
looked
into
it
and
said,
you
know,
i've
looked
into
this,
i
don't
think
we
should
prosecute.
and
what
they
said
was,
use
your
judgment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
there
are
problems
with
both
standards
both
ways.
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
in
this
case
the
lawyer
sat
down
with
the
other
firemen,
the
supervisor,
and
so
forth,
and
they
said
not
necessarily
this
event,
they
said
we
want
to
do
x.
and
the
lawyer
said,
i
have
to
tell
you,
it's
unclear
whether
x
is
constitutional
or
not.
now
because
it's
unclear,
i
also
have
to
tell
you
that
if
you
do
it,
you
will
not
be
held
personally
liable.
now,
can
a
lawyer
give
that
advice?
yes.
when
he
does,
of
course,
he
is
subjecting
himself
to
personal
liability.
now
it's
that
conflict
that
is
worrying
me,
among
other
things.
so
what
do
we
do
about
that?
the
lawyer
is
being
asked
to
give
advice
to
the
client.
under
the
canons
of
ethics
he
ought
to
have
their
interests
at
heart
and
in
doing
that
he
is
subjecting
himself
to
what
could
be
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
damages
or
whatever
in
suits
for
malpractice.
is
there
a
way
we
side
with
you
out
of
that
dilemma?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
what
i'm
assuming
in
the
question
is
since
it's
a
close
question,
he
has
to
worry
about
a
court
saying,
you
were
wrong
in
saying
it
was
legal.
it
was
not
legal.
the
matter
was
unclear,
but
it
was
not
legal.
at
that
point
he
becomes
subject
to
much
damages.
but
of
course,
the
others
do
not,
and
he
had
to
tell
them,
go
ahead
with
it.
you
understand
my
point.
so
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
may
be.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
is
what
is
your
set
of
rules.
if
we
don't
say
--
if
we
don't
say
you
have
immunity,
and
you
agree
that
this
is
a
bad
dilemma,
at
least
in
my
hypothetical
case,
i'm
trying
to
work
out
what
set
of
rules
you
advocate
in
order
to
either
say,
well,
that's
too
bad,
the
dilemma
is
there,
we
can't
get
around
it,
or
something
else.
that's
why
i
want
your
answer
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
change
it
slightly
and
he
puts
them
up
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
why
he
couldn't.
i
mean,
you
know,
he
says
"go
do
it".
in
other
words,
my
hypothetical
--
okay,
go
ahead.
