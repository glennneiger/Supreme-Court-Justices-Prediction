justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
it
matter
whether
the
privately
retained
attorney
works
in
close
cooperation
with
government
employees?
suppose
in
this
case
mr.
filarsky
had
simply
been
hired
to
go
off
and
perform
this
investigation,
and
at
the
end
of
the
investigation
report
the
results
to
the
town?
would
the
case
come
out
differently
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
--
suppose
the
government
hires
an
attorney
to
do
an
independent
investigation;
it
hires
an
outside
attorney
precisely
because
it
does
not
want
to
be
faced
with
allegations
that
it
has
manipulated
the
outcome
of
the
investigation
because
its
own
conduct
is
at
issue.
so
they
say,
you
are
going
to
be
independent,
hands-off,
we
are
not
going
to
interfere
at
all.
but
that
would
still
in
your
--
in
your
submission
satisfy
the
coordination
requirement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
prison
situation?
the
private
prison
--
the
guard
in
the
private
prison
is
performing
a
function
that
has
been
delegated
to
that
or
assumed
by
that
entity
pursuant
to
a
contract.
i
don't
understand
exactly
what
the
difference
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
your
test?
what
is
your
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
have
a
lawyer
who
is
a
part-time
employee.
does
that
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
part-time
employee
of
government
unit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
difference,
your
difference,
is
between
an
employee
and
an
independent
contractor?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
often
a
very
difficult
determination
under
the
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
a
lot
of
--
there
are
a
lot
of
--
i
think
--
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
law
firms.
i
think
all
law
firms
other
than
public
interest
firms
are
for-profit
firms,
and
the
attorneys
are
part-time
employees
of
municipalities
and
other
government
units
to
perform
various
functions,
part-time
judges,
part-time
prosecutors.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
now
you're
talking
about
history.
but
i
want
to
know
how
--
how
the
courts
are
to
determine
and
why
it
should
matter
how
a
municipality
sets
this
up.
suppose
the
town
had
hired
mr.
filarsky
as
a
part-time
town
employee.
so
he
has
the
certain
--
he
has
a
one
year
contract
or
six
month
contract
or
something
for
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
perform
services
for
a
certain
number
of
hours.
you
would
say
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
he's
an
employee.
they
passed
a
resolution
saying
he's
an
employee
of
the
town.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
there
was
a
distinction
between
employees
and
independent
contractors.
is
that
the
distinction
you
are
drawing
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are
saying
it's
clearly
established
that
there
isn't
a
difference
between
going
in
and
looking
for
the
insulation,
et
cetera,
and
telling
him
to
bring
it
out.
because
they
clearly
established
the
--
that
as
a
condition
of
employment
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
employee
cannot
be
required
to
submit
to
a
search?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
court's
cases
are
a
mix
of
history
and
--
and
policy.
the
court
has
recognized
both
absolute
immunity
--
has
recognized
absolute
immunity
in
instances
where
there
wasn't
absolute
immunity
at
common
law;
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
a
municipality
were
to
--
or
a
state
were
to
abolish
all
civil
service
rules
and
all
the
special
rules
and
go
back
to
employment
at
will
for
government
employees,
would
that
--
would
that
take
with
it
the
whole
qualified
immunity
regime?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
strange,
because
the
immunities
--
at
least
some
of
the
immunities
--
long
predate
the
establishment
--
the
institution
of
the
civil
service
system.
everybody
is
subject
to
market
forces.
every
person
who
works
is
influenced
by
market
forces
to
some
degree,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
political
appointees
within
the
united
states
department
of
justice
are
not
protected
by
civil
service,
so
should
they
lack
immunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
are
subject
to
market
forces,
aren't
they?
