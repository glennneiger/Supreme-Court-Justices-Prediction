why
isn't
that
the
case
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
enough
evidence
that
the
lawyer
was
the
one
who
held
the
investigation;
the
people
who
attended
the
meeting
between
the
lawyer,
the
respondent,
and
the
other
personnel
that
were
there
were
acceding
to
what
he
was
doing.
the
chief
--
he
goes
to
the
chief
and
he
says:
i
want
you
to
do
this.
and
the
chief
is
relying
on
him,
not
his
own
independent
judgment,
to
issue
the
command
that's
contested
here.
so,
that
sort
of
puts
your
argument
on
its
head,
because
it
appears
that
he
was
more
the
independent
investigator
than
he
was--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
individual
under
the
control
of
the
agency.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
argument
seems
to
fall
under
what
justice
scalia
termed
the
functional
test,
that
he's
serving
just
like
any
other
government
lawyer.
if
you
are
going
to
fit
this
case
under
the
richardson
majority
test,
how
would
you
do
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
would
be
a
breach
of
his
duty
as
an
attorney.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
he
would
be
subject
to
malpractice
in
that
case.
you
--
seriously,
i
find
this
whole
argument
about
market
forces
with
respect
to
attorneys
representing
people
odd,
because
there
is
a
whole
slew
of
unemployed
lawyers
who
would
be
happy
to
take
on
any
government
service
they
can.
so
going
back
to
the
--
that's
--
what
i
consider
the
central
argument
you
are
making,
which
is:
will
it
chill
advice?
and
i'm
not
sure
how
it
can,
given
the
independent
fiduciary
duty
that
an
attorney
has
to
zealously
guard
his
or
her
client's
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
don't
we
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
not
true
of
most
lawyers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
most
lawyers
are
not
part
of
the
civil
service
--
internal
lawyers
are
not
part
of
the
civil
service
system.
they're
generally
considered
employees
at
will.
at
least
most
of
the
circuit
courts
have
so
held.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
they're
policymakers,
and
as
such,
are
not
subject
to
civil
service
protections.
