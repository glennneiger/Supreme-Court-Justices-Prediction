is
that
across
the
board,
ms.
millett,
the
rule
you
just
stated?
is
there
any
situation
in
which
a
private
attorney
engaged
to
assist
a
government
office
in
the
performance
of
a
public
function
would
lack
qualified
immunity?
or
is
it
simply
whenever
a
government
agency
employs
a
private
attorney
to
assist
it
in
doing
its
work
that
attorney
will
have
qualified
immunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
in
this
case
the
firm
the
lawyer
was
associated
with
said
its
dominant
business
was
giving
advice
to
local
governments,
local
municipal
governments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
other
part
of
qualified
immunity,
and
i
know
it's
not
teed
up
in
this
case,
but
why
is
it
reasoned
decisionmaking
to
recognize
you
can't
enter
a
home
without
a
warrant
but
you
can
tell
the
occupant
to
bring
out
every
item
you
want
to
see?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
--
that
there's
clearly
established
law
to
say
that's
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
you
cross
--
cross-appeal
on
the
clearly
established
law?
because
then
--
then
you
concede
so,
arguendo,
he
had
qualified
immunity,
but
the
advice
he
gave
was
contrary
to
clearly
established
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
you
bring
up
that
--
that
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
whether
it
was
clearly
established?
in
other
words,
what
we
had
here
was
a
recognition,
we
can't
go
into
the
house.
we
can't
go
into
a
private
house
without
a
warrant.
so
in
fact
filarsky
said
something
about,
i
know
a
way
--
a
way
to
get
around
that,
we
just
tell
them
to
bring
out
the
items.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
what
about
the
argument
that
filarsky
makes,
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
proceeding
against
him,
inevitably
the
witnesses
would
be
the
government
employees?
there
would
be
the
battalion
chief,
the
fire
chief;
so
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
qualified
immunity
is
you
don't
want
to
disturb
a
--
government
employees
in
the
routine
performance
of
their
work.
certainly
in
this
case
there
would
be
disruption,
distraction
of
these
government
employees.
