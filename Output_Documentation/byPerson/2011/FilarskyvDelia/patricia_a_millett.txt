ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
private
attorney
is
temporarily
retained
by
the
government
to
work
in
coordination
with
or
under
the
direct
supervision
of
government
employees
in
fulfilling
the
government's
business,
in
getting
the
government's
work
done,
that
attorney
is
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
that
a
government
employee
performing
that
same
function
for
that
same
government
would
receive.
in
this
case
that
is
qualified
immunity.
that
rule
comports
with
the
history
and
policy
concerns
that
have
animated
this
court's
section
1983
and
immunity
jurisprudence.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it
--
it
may
well
be
the
latter
rule,
the
more
broader
one,
but
for
these
purposes,
the
court
only
needs
to
decide
the
situation
when
they
are
working
in
--
in
coordination
with
or
under
direct
supervision
of
government
employees.
and
i
want
to
clarify
that
answer,
because
how
one
defines
doing
a
public
service
--
for
example,
if
a
state
government
appoints
somebody
to
represent
one
of
their
police
officers
who's
been
sued
in
a
1983
action,
if
there
is
five
defendants
the
attorney
general
can't
represent
them
all,
they
will
commonly
appoint
people
and
will
pay
them,
some
states
will
pay
them
from
the
state
fisc.
so
they
will
be
paid
by
the
government
to
perform
a
governmental
function
in
that
sense,
but
their
allegiance
there
is
to
the
individual
employee,
not
to
the
government.
the
same
with
public
defenders.
so
there
are
certain
situations
where
someone
can
be
retained
by
the
government
in
that
sense,
paid
by
the
government
in
that
sense.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
don't
think
that
would,
but
in
this
--
but
i
think
it
depends
on
what
one
means
by
coordination
with
or
supervision.
and
with
respect
to
attorneys,
attorneys
can
never
be
an
independent
contractor
in
relationship
to
their
client
in
the
way
the
prison
was
in
richardson.
attorneys
just
can't
be.
they
are
always,
in
the
sense
of
the
rule
that
i'm
using
it,
working
for
their
client
agency,
their
client
government,
and
under
its
control
and
authority.
and
the
decisions
they
make
are
the
decisions
of
that
client.
and
that's
why
the
whole
--
the
whole
reason
we
should
have
this
rule
is
understanding
what
immunity
protects.
it
protects
government
decisionmaking,
governmental
conduct,
and
its
ability
to
maneuver
with
an
area
--
in
an
area
of
reasoned
decisionmaking.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
certainly
the
state
action
limitation
both
limits
the
operation
of
this
rule.
there's
many
times
attorneys
or
others
who
work
with
the
government
will
not
implicate
the
state
action
rule.
and
that's
sort
of
the
irony
of
--
of
this
case,
and
i
think
it
would
not
be
uncommon
in
attorney
cases.
the
only
reason
this
was
a
tort,
or
an
alleged
tort,
is
because
the
government
was
involved,
because
governmental
actors
took
his
advice,
conducted
a
search
--
he
didn't
--
issued
an
order
--
he
didn't.
and
yet
we
have
--
we're
left
in
this
is
odd
world
where
the
only
way
this
tort,
constitutional
tort
lawsuit,
can
go
forward
is
without
the
government.
now,
1983
is
about
deterring
governmental
conduct,
but
this
court's
immunity
jurisprudence
says
we
don't
over-deter
and
we
want
to
allow
the
government
to
operate
within
a
realm
of
reasoned
decisionmaking.
and
they
need
to
operate
within
that
realm,
get
reasoned
advice
and
make
reasoned
decisions,
regardless
of
whether
the
source
of
the
advice
is
a
temporarily
or
permanently
retained
attorney.
the
need
is
for
reasoned
decisionmaking.
and
if
you
over-deter,
which
is
what
an
action
against
a
private
attorney
who
is
now
charged
with
litigating
and
defending
the
government's
allegedly
unconstitutional
conduct,
standing
all
alone
while
all
the
government
actors
have
walked
away,
that
turns
section
1983
on
its
head.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
state
law
requirement,
the
state
action
requirement
that
justice
kennedy
referred
to,
will
up
front
require
allegations
by
the
plaintiffs
that
will
discuss
the
coordinated,
presumably
the
coordinated
action,
because
there
has
to
be
some
level
of
coordination.
but
the
second
reason
is,
as
i
said,
with
respect
to
attorneys,
i
don't
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
hard
question,
because
they
are
forever
agents
and
fiduciaries.
they
can
never
be
the
independent
contractor
that
you
had
in
richardson.
they
are
always
answerable
to
and
working
for
their
governmental
client.
and
when
i
say
supervision
here,
i
don't
think
the
test
here
is
--
is
an
on-hands,
day-to-day
looking
over
your
shoulders.
the
government
has
to
be
able
to
get
the
advice
of
professionals
and
to
trust
them--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
--
it
would
in
this
sense,
because
there
would
be
--
and
i
am
assuming
here
we
are
not
talking
like
a
bivens
appointment
or
something
like
that.
but
here
--
because
understand
what
happens
in
that
situation.
they
are
being
appointed
to
investigate
for
the
government
and
on
behalf
of
the
government.
and
it's
not
usually
because
we
say
the
government
writ
large
may
have
done
something
that
would
create
a
conflict.
it
may
be
an
individual
employee
or
something,
that's
when
the
conflict
comes.
but
they
are
working
for
the
government.
the
government
is
their
client.
they
are
not
freewheeling
independent
contractors.
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
difference
is
--
there
is
a
practical
difference
and
then
a
legal
doctrinal
difference.
the
practical
difference
is
that
in
richardson
it
was
a
quite
unique
situation
where
the
government
really
had
washed
its
hands
of
the
prison
operations.
it
had
put
the
day-to-day
operation
of
the
prison,
the
decisionmaking
of
the
prison,
how
we
treat
the
prisoners
entirely
in
the
hands
of
a
private
contractor,
subject
only
to
what
this
court
said
was
very
limited
supervision,
essentially
in
contract
terms.
but
it
had
ceded
that
authority
and
it
did
not
exercise
the
control.
it
did
not
exercise
the
day-to-day
decisionmaking.
and
that's
where
we
get
into
the
doctrinal
point.
so
the
decisions
that
were
being
made
there,
and
that
were
--
the
lawsuit
concerned,
there
wasn't
a
single
governmental
defendant
named
in
that
case.
it
was
just
simply
the
private
--
the
private
guards
that
were
at
issue
there.
and
the
decisions
that
were
made
were
the
private
company's
decisions.
and
so
this
court
said
there,
that's
not
what
qualified
immunity
is
out
--
is
out
to
protect.
it
is
to
protect
what,
the
government's
decisionmaking,
the
special
concerns
that
arise
when
you
are
bringing
lawsuits
that
are
designed
to
regulate,
limit,
deter
governmental
decisionmaking.
we
have
to
protect
that
area
of
reason.
if
the
government's
not
making
the
decision,
they
have
passed
the
buck,
they
have
handed
it
off,
then
there
is
nothing
to
protect.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--first
of
all
--
a
couple
of
responses.
first
of
all,
no,
that's
nothing
like
richardson.
this
was
the
government's
investigation.
they
initiated
it.
they
brought
him
on
to
the
team
for
his
expertise,
much
like
prosecutors
might
bring
on
a
psychologist
to
evaluate
a
criminal
defendant.
now,
are
the
prosecutors
going
to
sit
there
and
say,
you
know,
psychologist,
you
should
ask
this
question,
or
are
they
going
to
defer
to
the
medical
expertise?
that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
do
that
--
first
of
all
i'm
putting
it
right
in
--
in
richardson's
language,
which
said
it
was
reserving
this
very
question,
and
that
is,
when
an
attorney
or
any
individual
who's
working
in
close
coordination
or
under
the
supervision
of
government
officials
in
the
performance
of
an
essential
function.
and
so
that
makes
clear
that
richardson
was
deciding
not
that
situation,
the
handed-off
turnkey
situation.
this
--
there's
no
turnkey
here.
this
is
mr.
filarsky
being
brought
onto
the
team.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no.
in
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes,
but
independent
counsel
still
sued
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
their
client
was
the
united
states
government.
that
is
whom
--
that
is
the
interest
in
which
they
worked.
they
were
--
they
had
a
client
that
they
were
answerable
to.
they
were
not
freewheeling
independent
contractors;
they
were
attorneys
with
a
client.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
this
court
assumed
that
question
but
did
not
answer
it
in
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
part
assumes
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
when
you're
operating
a
prison,
although
i
think
to
--
there's
a
reason
this
court
reserved
it,
because
the
question
there
is
--
with
certainly
the
corporation
was
under
color
of
law,
whether
the
individuals
who
worked
for
the
corporation
would
also
be
under
the
color
of
law.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
this
court's
already
crossed
that
bridge
in
cases
like
wyatt,
where,
for
example
--
and
it
does
--
because
the
state
law
requirement
can
sweep
broadly
in
some
situations.
so
i
don't
think
in
a
situation
like
wyatt
v.
cole,
where
you
have
private
plaintiffs
pursuing
a
private
agenda
and
they
simply
invoke
a
state
law,
that
that
makes
them
integrated
with
the
government
in
the
way
that
an
attorney
is,
and
certainly
the
way
petitioner
was
here,
that
they're
not
part
of
the
governmental
team,
and
they're
not
making
--
they
weren't
making
decisions
in
the
interest
of
the
government.
there
was
no
governmental
decisionmaking
to
protect
there,
and
that's
what
--
the
rationale
this
court
gave
for
denying
qualified
immunity
in
wyatt.
the
key
here
is
that
this
is
exact
--
you
cannot
protect
governmental
decisionmaking
in
this
context
without
protecting
the
source
of
advice
for
that
decisionmaking--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
are
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
that
rationale
would
mean
no
government
lawyers
get
the
protection
either,
because
they
have
that
exact
same
obligation
of
fealty,
and
we
don't
apply
that
rule.
that
hasn't
even
been
questioned.
and
the
reason
we
don't
is
we
understand
that
this
is
a
more
layered
inquiry
into
timidity.
first
of
all,
we
don't
even
want
the
subconscious
pressures
that
would
come
with
full
freight
liability
for
governmental
conduct
to
any
angry
third
party
even
subconsciously
interfering
with
the
decisions
of
government
lawyers
temporarily
or
permanently
retained.
secondly,
we
want
the
government
to
be
able
to
get
the
advice,
to
be
encouraged
to
get
the
advice.
section
1983
must
support
governments
getting
legal
advice
to
counsel
them
in
complying
with
the
law
that
section
1983
enforces,
but
government
will
be
deterred
from
obtaining
legal
advice
if
the
costs
of
getting
an
attorney
--
especially
if
you're
a
small
town,
municipality,
county,
you
don't
--
can't
afford
a
full-time
staff,
and
the
cost
of
getting
an
attorney
is
all
those
things
that
qualified
immunity
wanted
to
protect
against.
our
decision
--
reasonable
decisionmaking
that
we
thought
was
protected
by
qualified
immunity
is
now
on
trial.
and
we
have
to
be
there
as
witnesses,
and
the
jury
is
going
to
assess
liability
for
a
reasonable
governmental
decision.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
would
have
had
the
same
sort
of
good
faith
defense
that
this
court
in
harlow
turned
into
qualified
immunity.
both
those
lawyers--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
--
it
--
the
harlow
immunity
came
from
the
same
root.
what
happened
in
wyatt
was
we
said
we
will
turn
that
into
protection
for
the
government
when
we
need
to
protect
the
special
functioning
of
government.
you
had
no
need
--
the
court
had
no
need
to
do
that
in
wyatt
because
there
was
no
governmental
decisionmaking
at
stake
there.
but
the
--
the
same
type
of
defense
--
this
court
recognized--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
answer
--
the
answer
is
that
it
is
the
same
type
of
defense
that
this
court
recognized
in
prior
cases
as
supporting
qualified
immunity
when
needed
to
protect
the
decisions
of
the
government.
and
richardson
itself
recognized
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--not
this
case
at
all,
because
you've
got
layers.
you
have
layers
of
government
--
of
history.
you
have
the
history
recognized
in
richardson
for
--
for
lawyers
who
are
working
at
the
behest
of
the
government,
that
specific
history.
you
have
the
general
history
where
--
where
attorneys
were
provided
a
reasonable
and
good-faith,
malice
and
probable
cause
type
of
defense,
which
again
is
the
type
of
--
the
type
of
defense
that
gets
turned
into
qualified
immunity
when
needed
to
protect
government's
reasoned
decisionmaking.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you.
justice
breyer,
your
dilemma
is
--
is
at
the
crux
of
why
qualified
immunity
is
appropriate
here,
because
not
only
do
you
have
the
lawyer
saying
well,
you'll
be
all
okay
but
i'm
going
to
be
going
down
in
this
lawsuit.
you
are
going
to
have
a
duty
to
inform
this
client
that
in
fact
this
will
lead
to
litigation;
you
will
be
protected
in
your
personal
capacity,
but
guess
what,
litigation
is
going
to
ensue.
that
can
influence
and
--
and
deter
both
lawyers'
willingness
to
work
for
the
government
at
these
cut
rates
or
pro
bono
rates
--
subconsciously,
the
advice
they
give,
and
it
can
make
the
government
not
want
to
act
on
the
advice,
which
is
precisely
what
we
want
to
protect.
nothing
like
that
was
happening
in
richardson.
the
government
was
nowhere
on
the
scene
when
the
constitutional
decisions
being
challenged
--
they
weren't
even
percipient
witnesses
in
that
situation.
the
second
--
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
fiduciary
duty
doesn't
change
it
other
than
it
confirms
that
he's
working
in
the
interest
of
the
government,
but
every
agent
has
a
fiduciary
duty
to
their
principal,
and
so
you
can't
deny
qualified
immunity
on
that
ground
or
you'll
have
a
sweeping
decision
on
your
hands.
the
market
concerns,
justice
sotomayor,
the
test
is
not
whether
a
warm
body
could
be
found
to
fulfill
this
operation
if
he
won't
do
it.
this
is
a
completely
different
market
from
richardson,
where
there's
only
one
client
for
prisons
and
that's
the
government.
here,
the
government
is
competing
for
the
services.
when
it
needs
a
skilled
attorney,
when
it
wants
people
of
the
caliber
that
the
government
service
needs
and
deserves,
it
is
competing.
and
right
now,
as
the
chief
justice
recognized,
a
lot
of
times,
including
for
mr.
filarsky,
that's
done
at
discount
rates.
these
folks
--
this
is
already
a
marginal
decision.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
market
decisions,
then
you're
going
to
push
that
weight.
and
if
the
answer
is
--
if
you
decide
to
take
on
this
pro
bono
representation,
or
cut
your
rates
out
of
public
duty,
and
--
and
the
willingness
to
serve
your
government,
guess
what
comes
with
it?
you
alone
will
be
holding
the
bag
at
the
end
of
this
for
the
governmental
misconduct.
section
1983
is
supposed
to
deter
governmental
conduct.
it
is
not
supposed
to
deter
the
reasonable
advice
given
by
lawyers
to
governmental
clients.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
