justice
anthony

kennedy
and
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
built-in
limitation
because
the
question
doesn't
even
come
up
unless
there
is
state
action.
so
there
has
to
be
close
enough
cooperation
so
there
is
state
action.
i
had
never
thought
that
when
a
private
attorney
gives
an
opinion
letter
to
a
government
agency
or
government
entity
at
its
request
that
there
is
any
state
action
there
at
all.
so
that
question
--
so
there
the
question
just
wouldn't
even
come
up;
am
i
correct?
i
assume--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
--
it's
just
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
imbued
with
state
action
than
imprisoning
someone.
that's
--
that's
the
problem
i
have
in
thinking
about
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
question
that
is
not
teed
up,
but
i
guess
i'm
just
curious
to
know
about
the
history
of
the
case.
was
it
argued
that
there
was
no
state
action
here?
and
in
your
view,
is
that
a
very
simple
question
to
answer?
