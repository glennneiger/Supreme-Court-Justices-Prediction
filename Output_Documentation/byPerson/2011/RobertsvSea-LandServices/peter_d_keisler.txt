mr.
peter
d.
keisler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
if
i
may
by
addressing
justice
scalia's
and
the
chief
justice's
questions
on
whether
the
term
award
can
bear
the
meaning
that
ascribe
to
it
and
then
explain
why,
since
it
can
bear
that
meaning,
this
is
the
only
sensible
interpretation
of
the
act.
first,
it
is
not
uncommon,
your
honor,
to
use
the
term
award
to
describe
a
benefit
conferred
by
a
statute.
the
dictionary
definition
is
a
benefit
conferred.
your
honor,
justice
scalia
used
a
formulation,
what
if
a
statute
awards
a
tax
credit.
well,
the
court's
decision
in
new
energy
company
v.
limbach
began
an
ohio
statute
awards
a
tax
credit
to
a
certain
producer
of
ethanol.
i
think
even
your
honor
alderson
reporting
company
was
the
author
of
that
decision.
it
is--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--i
think
the
party
becomes
newly
awarded
at
the
time
that
the
party
becomes
disabled,
and
therefore
there
is
an
amount
due
under
the
statute.
and--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--but
it
is
a
usage
within
the
longshore
act
elsewhere,
as
mr.--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--at
the
time
they
became
qualified
for
what
the
statute
required
them
to
do
to
get
the
tax
credit,
yes.
and
that
is
how
it
is
used
in
910
(h)(1),
as
justice
kagan
said.
it's
how
it's
used
in
908.
and
section
933,
specifically
provides
petitioner's
definition
of
award,
a
formal
compensation
order,
but
says
it
is
only
for
purposes
of
this
subsection.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
that's
correct.
and
that's
why
this
is
a
case
like
robinson
v.
shell
oil,
in
which
the
word
employer
was
used
throughout
title
vii
in
different
ways.
and
what
the
court
said
is
you
then
have
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
individual
provision
in
which
the
word
appears
that
you
are
construing
to
determine
how
the
word
is
being
used
in
that
particular
provision.
and
here
the
most
fundamental
reason
why
it
is
an
untenable
construction
of
this
act
to
rely
on
the
date
of
a
compensation
order
to
determine
the
applicable
maximum
rate
is
that
then
the
act
would
be
silent
as
to
the
maximum
rate
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
in
which
compensation
is
paid,
because
as
mr.
palmore
said,
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
no
claim
is
filed.
and
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out,
when
no
claim
is
filed,
no
compensation
order
will
ever
be
issued.
and
that's
not
an
accident.
that
is
a
function
of
a
very
central
feature
of
the
act's
design
that
petitioner's
interpretation
is
entirely
at
odds
with.
the
act
is
designed
to
enable
compensation
to
be
calculated
precisely
and
as
early
as
possible
so
the
money
can
get
into
the
employee's
hands
very
quickly
and
with
a
minimum
of
instances
in
which
the
administrative
machinery
has
to
be
invoked.
that's
why
the
norm
is
no
compensation
order.
and
so
petitioner's
interpretation
is
counter
to
that
in
at
least
two
respects.
it
relies
on
the
existence
of
a
compensation
order
which
in
most
instances
won't
and
shouldn't
issue,
and
would
maximize,
rather
than
minimize,
the
number
of
instances
in
which
someone
has
to
go
and
get
an
order
to
force
compensation
orders
out
of
a
system
to
make
petitioner's
interpretation
work
even
though
everything
is
happening
exactly
as
the
act
says
it
should
be.
the
employer
is
voluntarily
paying
exactly
the
amount
that
the
employee
says
is
due,
and
there
is
no
need
to
get
the
agency
involved.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
but
if
your
honor
thinks
about
the
situation
in
which
the
employee
is
voluntarily
receiving
from
the
employer
everything
that
the
employee
agrees
is
due.
then
the
question
is,
in
that
circumstance
where
the
employer
is
doing
everything
right,
what
can
the
employer
do
to
force
out
of
the
system
a
compensation
order
that
will
lock
in
the
maximum
rate?
and
petitioner's
solution
to
that
problem
evidences
the
problem
with
his
position.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
but
there
is
no
compensation
order
until
that
employee
files
a
claim.
and
under
petitioner's
interpretation,
there
would
therefore
be
no
knowable
maximum
rate.
and
petitioner's
solution
to
that
problem,
on
page
16
of
his
reply
brief,
is
to
say
that
the
employer
should
threaten
a
bad
faith
cutoff
of
funds.
the
employer
should
say:
i
will
cut
you
off
unless
you
file
a
claim.
that
is
bad
for
everyone.
it's
bad
for
the
employee
who
has
access
to
payments
delayed;
it's
bad
for
the
employer
who
apparently
is
being
told
that
it
must
controvert
liability
in
bad
faith
because
the
employer
doesn't
in
fact
disagree
that
the
employee
is
entitled
to
liability
or
face
a
10
%
penalty
for
cutting
off
the
employee
without
a
basis
for
controverting
liability,
and
it's
bad
for
the
agency
who
suddenly
has
all
these
claims
filed,
all
in
a
situation
in
which
everything
is
working
exactly
as
the
act
intends.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
910(8)(1).
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
new
energy
company
v
limbach.
it
was
a
commerce
clause
case
from,
i
think,
1989
in
which
your
honor
began
the
opinion
by
saying,
to
describe
a
setup,
an
ohio
statute
awards
tax
benefits
to,
and
then
describes
the
category
of
energy
producers
who
could
take
advantage
of
the
tax
benefit.
and
i
think
those
energy
producers--
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
--robinson
v.
shell
oil?
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
okay.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
i
think
it's
the
employee
who
was
receiving
voluntary
payments,
and
everything
is
proceeding
the
way
the
act
intended.
but,
the
employer,
in
order
to
know
what
its
maximum
rate
will
be,
in
order
not
to
be
surprised
5
years
hence
by
a
maximum
rate
that
only
then
can
be
known,
has
to
force
a
compensation
order
out
of
the
system.
and
the
only
way
petitioner
says
the
employer
can
do
that
is
by
threatening
a
bad
faith
cutoff
of
funds.
whether
it
happens
frequently
or
infrequently,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
an
interpretation
that
relies
on
a
mechanism
that
is
so
obviously
counter
to
the
way
the
statute
is
supposed
to
function
is,
by
virtue
of
that,
an
extremely
unlikely
and
unnatural
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
in
1972,
congress
was
told
that
it
would
be
about
10
percent.
my
understanding
is
since
then
it's
grown
so
that
i'm
told
that
about
20
percent
of
cases
today
require
application
of
the
maximum
rate.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
ever
since
1972,
each
year's
maximum
as
calculated
by
the
secretary
of
labor
has
been
higher
than
the
preceding
year.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
theoretically,
it
can.
it
never
has.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
keisler
i
think
the
function
of
"newly"
in
this
statute
is
something
different,
justice
scalia.
and
that
relates
to
the
questions
that
your
honor
and
justice
breyer
were
asking
about
the
relationship
between
the
"currently
receiving"
clause
and
the
final
clause.
i
think
the
19(f),
which
provides
for
a
cola,
a
cost
of
living
increase
every
year
for
that
narrow
subset
of
the
most
disabled
of
employees.
they
and
they
alone
get
that
annual
bump-up.
and
so
that
"currently
receiving"
clause
is
written
for
that
category
to
make
sure
that
their
bump-up
isn't
capped
by
a
static
maximum
rate.
the
other
part
of
the
clause,
"newly
awarded
compensation",
is
about
everybody
else.
now,
i
think
the
use
of
the
word
"newly"
there
is
just
to
distinguish
it
from
the
"currently
receiving"
clause,
which
is
escalating
year
by
year.
and
those
newly
awarded
compensation,
meaning
at
one
point,
fixed
in
time
--
only
when
you
are
"newly"
awarded
compensation
are
you
then
going
to
have
your
maximum
rate
fixed.
and
then
--
and
both
petitioner
and
we
agree
--
whatever
it's
fixed
at,
whatever
year,
that
stays
the
same
for
the
duration
of
your
collection
of
compensation.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
