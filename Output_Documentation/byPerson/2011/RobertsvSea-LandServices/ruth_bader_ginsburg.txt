justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
and
the
critical
time,
then
--
i
think,
isn't
it
true
that
most
compensation
payments
are
the
--
are
as
a
result
of
voluntary
action
by
the
employer
and
not
a
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
in
those
cases,
when
the
employer
says,
okay,
i
will
voluntarily
make
this
compensation
available,
then
the
measuring
--
the
--
the
pay
would
be
measured
by
the
time
the
employer
makes
--
makes
the
compensation
available,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
award.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
--
what
is
--
i
mean,
it
can
be.
but
here's
a
person
who
has
been
injured
and
gets
compensation
without
having
to
bring
any
legal
proceeding
for
it.
what
is
the
weekly
--
the
measure
then?
it
can't
be
an
award,
the
date
of
the
award,
because
there
is
no
award.
so
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
reading
doesn't
encourage
employers
to
pay,
because
they
can
stop
--
just
by
saying
they
contest,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
your
reading
leads
i
think
to
protraction.
and
they
get
that
date
of
injury
rule
no
matter
how
long
they
string
it
out
under
your
reading.
if
you
read
--
what
is
the
magic
phrase
--
newly--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can
say,
well,
that
means
in
the
case
of
the
employer
who
pays
promptly,
pays
immediately
and
continues
to
pay
voluntarily,
that
the
compensation
is
required
when
the
employer
starts
paying
voluntarily.
but
if
the
employer
stops
paying,
then
the
compensation
is
newly
awarded
when
there
is
an
award.
so
i
don't
see
why
--
what
kind
of
problems
this
statute
would
have
if
we
say
newly
awarded
could
mean
awarded
by
the
statute,
which
would
be
newly
awarded
when
you
are
injured.
but
it
can
also
mean
compensation
ordered
by
an
award.
so,
you
have
the
employer
who
pays
promptly
can
lock
in
that
early
date,
but
if
he
doesn't
pay
promptly,
the
--
then
the
ceiling
is
going
to
go
up
till
the
time
the
award
is
entered.
what
is
wrong
with
that
reading?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
answer
to
the
problem
of
an
employer
protracting,
so
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
sooner,
he
can
wait
till
later
is
there
would
be
no
penalty
as
long
as
the
employer
says
i
am
contesting,
but
you
say
the
attorneys
fees,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
percentage
of
the
compensation
cases
involve
the
statutory
maximum?
because
if
your
pay
is
less
than
the
statutory
maximum,
this
issue
doesn't
come
up.
