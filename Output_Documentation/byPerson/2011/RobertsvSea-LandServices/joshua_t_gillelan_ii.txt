mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
dana
roberts
was
injured
and
shortly
thereafter
became
disabled
in
the
course
of
his
work
for
sea-land
in
fiscal
year
2002,
but
he
was
not
awarded
compensation
until
fiscal
year
2007.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
maximum
weekly
rate
established
by
section
6
of
the
longshore
act
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
his
disability
began
or
that
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
he
was
awarded
compensation
governs
his
case.
he
is
entitled
to
whichever
maximum
is
the
applicable
one.
section
6(c)
of
the
act
provides
explicitly
that
the
applicable
maximum
is
that
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the
claimant
is
"newly
awarded
compensation".
the
term
19(e)
of
the
act,
which
is
described
in
section
19(e)
as
"the
order
making
the
award".
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
well,
because
the
statute
--
in
some
sense
of
the
word
"award"--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--i
think
that
the
text
will
not
bear
that
reading,
in
particular
because
the
payments
that
you
are
describing
that
could
be
considered
an
award
are
described
throughout
the
act
as
payments
"without
an
award".
now,
how
the
claimant
can
have
been
newly
awarded
benefits
at
the
time
the
employer
makes
a
payment
"without
an
award"
i
think
defies
the
meaning
of
that
word.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
section
14(a)
through
(e)
refers
to
compensation
payments
without
an
award.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
those
are
the
provisions.
section
14(a)
and
(b)
directs
those
payments
without
an
award.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
that
is
true,
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
i
think
not,
because
the
--
the
statutory
provision
says
it's
the
award
that
is
determinative.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
but
there
can
be
an
award.
i
think
that's
the
critical--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--the
employer
that
wants
to
lock
in
this
year's
maximum
rate
and
not
have
his
liability
progress
above
that
simply
needs
to
have
an
award
entered.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
that
provision,
which
--
that
clause--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--that
separate
clause,
which
is
not
in
this
case,
because--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--no,
i
think
not.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
the
function
of
that
clause
is
that
in
permanent
total
and
death
cases,
because
there
is
an
annual
escalator
provision,
whatever
your
rate
is
this
year
going
to
go
up.
if
it's
permanent
total
or
death
case,
it
is
going
to
go
up
each
october
1st
by
the
increase
in
the
national
average
wage.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
if
you
--
if--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--i
wouldn't
say
(c)
doesn't
apply,
no.
i
think--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--well,
the
--
the
function
of
that
separate
clause
is
for
cases
in
which
an
award
has
been
entered
of
death
benefits
or
permanent
total
disability
benefits,
and
everything
up
to
that
point
is
governed
by
the
maximum
that
is
in
effect
at
the
time
of
that--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--well,
mr.
roberts
did
not
fall
within
the
currently
receiving
compensation--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--okay.
i
hope
i
can
provide
that
sense.
the
function
of
that
separate
clause
is
that
a
claimant
who
has
been
awarded
compensation
at
a
given
rate,
which
is
the
maximum
at
the
time
of
the
award,
will
continue
to
receive
compensation--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--i
can
certainly
see
that
those
terms
would
appear
to
apply
to
that
situation
in
which
the
employer
is
paying
compensation
for
death
or
for
permanent
total
disability.
that
wouldn't
provide
us
for
a
maximum
--
any
applicable
maximum.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
say
about
the
function
of
this
clause
is
that
a
claimant
who
has
been
awarded
compensation
for
permanent
total
disability
--
let's
assume
the
employer
hasn't
paid
anything
until
the
alj
issues
an
award,
and
at
the
time
that
award
is
issued
the
maximum
is
$1,000
a
week
and
the
employer
was
--
the
employee
was
making
more
than
1500,
so
that
maximum
is
the
rate.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
he
certainly
is
not
in
the
same
position,
no.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes,
it
would.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
and
that
is
precisely
the
function
of
that
clause.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes,
yes,
definitely.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
and
for
permanent
total
disability
and
death
cases--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--they
do.
if
the
award
is
for
permanent
total
disability
or
for
death,
they
do.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes,
your
reading
does
make
perfect
sense.
and
the
function
of
that
second
--
the
clause
for
those
currently
receiving
compensation
for
permanent
total
or
death,
is
that
even
when
the
maximum
continues
to
go
up
after
the
date
of
an
award
that
new
maximum
is
the
applicable
one
for
the
continuing
period
of
disability
or
survivorship.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
marginally
more
sense,
perhaps
so.
but
that
is
an
argument
that
should
be
addressed
to
congress.
congress
could
easily
have
made
section
6(c)
turn
on
the
time
of
injury.
instead
they
had
provided
very
explicitly--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--yes.
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes,
and
that
each
use
of
the
term
"award",
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
is
consistent
with
that.
that
is,
whenever
congress
refers
in
this
statute
to
an
award
or
compensation
being
awarded,
it
is
talking
about
the
order
making
the
award
as
its
described
in
section
19(e).
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
that
is
exactly
true.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no,
i
hope
i
am
not
conceding
that.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
i
would
say
they
certainly
are
not
identically
situated.
the
claimant
who
has
an
award--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--there
are
serious
consequences
of
the
fact
that
one
has
an
award
and
the
other
is
being
paid
only
without
an
award.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no,
no.
the
clause
that
depends
on
whether
you
are
currently
receiving
only
applies
to
permanent
total
disability
and
death
cases.
in
all
other
cases,
the
clause
that
says
"newly
awarded"
is
the
only
applicable
provision.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
correct.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
and
temporary
total.
temporary
total
has
--
the
rates
do
not
go
up
each
year.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
okay.
i
think
the
point
is
to
encourage
the
employer
to
get
an
award
entered
promptly,
because
that
way
they
will
lock
in
that
early
maximum
rate
or
minimum
rate.
the
minimum
rate
provision
applies
exactly
the
same
way
under
section
6(c).
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
well,
they
want
that
to
happen
as
often
as
possible,
but
the
employer
has
the
right
in
any
case
to
file
a
notice
with
the
department
of
labor
saying,
we
do
not
believe
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
compensation.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
i
don't
think
it's
stupid,
but
yes,
my
basic
argument
is--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--"newly
awarded
compensation"
are
the
critical
words.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
in
(c),
yes,
6(c).
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no.
excuse
me.
the
other
clause
of
that
provision,
the
one
that
says
"currently
receiving
compensation",
that
one
only
applies
to
survivors
and
permanent
totally
disabled
workers.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
for
permanent
total
disability
and
death,
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no,
the
--
the
clause--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--well,
that's
certainly
--
no
one
has
put
forward
that
construction,
and
that
would
mean
that
there
is
no
maximum
applicable
to
other
categories
of
disability,
like
mr.
roberts's
disability.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
i
think
--
actually
my
experience,
my
universal
experience
with
this
statute,
is
that
that
is
not
a
realistic
view
of
what
claimant's
behavior
is.
the
critical
difference
is
an
award
--
the
entry
of
an
award
does
not
merely
confirm
that
the
employer
is
making
payments;
it
requires
it
to
continue
making
those
payments
until--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
oh,
i
think
--
well
--
i
have
trouble
accepting
that
hypothetical
situation,
because--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--nothing.
it
simply
requires
the
employer
to
induce
the
claimant
to
file
a
claim
if
it
wants
that
award.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
well,
they
wouldn't
--
indeed,
they
wouldn't
have
to
stop
payment.
they
simply
need
to
tell
the
claimant:
if
you
don't
file
a
claim,
we
are
going
to
stop
payments.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no.
i
think
under
the
government's
interpretation,
as
under
ours,
they
fall
under
those--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--well,
they
are
covered
by
it,
but
before
we
know
which
year's
maximum
applies,
an
award--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--that's
correct.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--i
think
it
does
because
it
encourages
the
employer
to
have
an
award
entered
so
that
it
will
have
the
benefit
of
the
current
maximum
rate
and
not
next
year's
or
the
year's
after
or
the
year's
after
that.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
i
may
have
missed
what
the
third
of
those
was.
i
have
the--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--ah,
okay.
um,
yes,
9
--
the
section
8(d)(1)
that
they
are
referring
to
refers
to
an
award
to
an
employee
--
the
unpaid
portion
of
an
award
to
an
employee
who
dies
before
that
award
has
been
paid
out.
their
reading
of
"award"
in
that
provision
is
contradicted
by
the
subsequent
paragraph
of
the
same
subsection,
which
says
"an
award
may
be
made
after
the
death
of
the
injured
employee.
"
it's
908(d)(3).
now
that
is
impossible
on
their
reading
of
8(d)(1).
no,
what
it
means
in
8(d)(1),
as
throughout
the
act,
is
an
award.
and
if
none
has
been
entered
while
the
claimant
is
still
alive,
it
is
entered
after
his
death.
and
the
survivors
under
that
provision
take
the
rest
of
it
that
had
not
been
paid
before
the
death.
now,
you
have
essentially
the
same
analysis
of
those
other
provisions.
yes,
in
those
other
provisions
as
well,
it
does
mean
a
compensation
order.
if
you
cut
it
loose
from
that
statutory
foundation,
we
get
three
or
four
different
possible
meanings
that
the
respondents
try
to
put
on
it,
and
we
are
cut
loose
from
anything.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
no
doubt
it
is,
yes.
and
--
and
perhaps
there
may
be
some
variation
in
the
meaning
in
the
other
provisions.
that's
possible.
but
in
section
6(d),
we
think
it
has
to
mean
the
entry
of
an
award.
that's
the
only
definite
event
it
could
refer
to.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
right.
i
would
reserve
what
time
i
have
left.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
thank
you.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
only,
of
course,
if
the
employees'
own
wages
at
the
time
of
the
injury
qualified
for
that.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
yes.
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
well,
i
think
in
that
situation,
the
claimant
hasn't
triggered
that
award.
in
fact,
the
claimant
has
triggered
the
maximum
that's
in
effect
at
the
time
of
that
award
that
only
makes
--
it's
an
award
only
of
what
the
employer
has
been
paying.
it's
not
a
denial,
as
its
characterized
in
the
government's
brief.
but
it
is
--
an
award
only
of
what
of
the
employer
has
been
paying.
if
the
claimant
did
not
bring
it
forward
with
that,
and
the
employer
let
it
go
for
still
further
years,
then
even
a
subsequent
year's
maximum
would
be
the
idea--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--i
think
each
of
those
arguments
is
fallacious.
they
misdescribe
the
statute
in
their
reasons
why
this
is
not
a
sensible
provision.
but
even
if
there
is
an
ambiguity--
mr.
joshua
t.
gillelan
ii
--before
--
before
we
lose,
that
--
the
other
possible
meanings
of
"newly
awarded"
have
got
to
include
what
they
say
the
test
is.
