justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
would
justice
scalia's
reading
in
your
judgment
--
accept
his
proposition
that
those
currently
receiving
voluntary
payments
from
the
employer
fall
under
subsection
(c).
would
his
reading
require
the
employer
every
year
to
recalculate
the
benefits
to
the
maximum
that's
established
that
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
why
his
reading--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
function
of
(b)
is
to
set
a
maximum
that
will
control
all
payments
present
and
future.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
if
you
read
it
the
way
he
does,
that
maximum
would
change
each
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
so
what
happens
to
your
argument
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
employers
have
a
way
to
seek
a
compensation
order?
as
i
read
the
regulations,
the
only
way
they
can
do
that
is
if
the
employee
files
a
claim,
and
the
employee's
filing
of
the
claim
then
sets
the
process
in
motion.
i
can't
imagine
that
any
employee,
knowing
that
a
future
award
could
help
them,
would
bother
filing
a
claim
to
help
the
employer
lock
in
his
rate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
my
question.
most
of
your
argument
is
premised
on
the
--
i
thought,
that
the
employer
could
lock
in
his
rate--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--by
seeking
an
award.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
i
disagree
with
you
that
the
act
doesn't
provide
for
that
and
neither
do
the
regulations,
that
only
employees
can
seek
awards,
what
happens
to
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
i've
studied
it,
i
think
that's
the
case.
assume
that
fact
to
be
true,
that
employers
have
no
regulatory
or
statutory
right
to
seek
an
award.
they
can
either
stop
paying
and
have
the
employee
make
a
claim
or
not.
how
--
what
does
this
do
to
your
argument,
if
that's
accurate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
by
stopping
payment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
destroys
the
whole
voluntary
payment
aspect.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
an
odd
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
gillelan,
could
i
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
page
are
you
on?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
his
answer
to
that
was
--
his
answer
to
that
was
that
the
provision
also
permits
an
entry
after
someone
--
of
an
order
after
someone
dies.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
--
the
incongruity
is
taken
care
of
by
the
act
directly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
brief
--
your
brief
seem
to
use
the
newly
awarded
compensation,
your
meaning
of
it,
at
the
time
of
injury,
at
the
time
of
disability,
the
time
of
entitlement
to
compensation;
and
it
seems
to
use
those
terms
interchangeably.
what
term
are
you
settling
on
and
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
let's
assume
an
employer
pays,
continues
to
pay
over
a
period
of
time,
and
the
employee
needs
more
money
and
goes
in
and
says
"you
owe
me
more
money;
i'm
going
to
make
a
claim.
"
the
board
says,
"no,
he
doesn't
owe
you
more
money.
"
"he
was
paying
the
right
amount.
"
and
so
you're
not
entitled
to
the
1200
you're
asking
for;
you're
only
entitled
to
the
1000
he
was
paying.
under
your
view,
if
that
happened
5
or
10
years
after
the
payments
started,
would
the
employer
be
liable
for
the
higher
average
10
years
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
it
does,
that
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
stops
an
employee
from
simply
doing
what
i
said?
what
stops
an
employee
from
kicking
up
his
own
maximum
by
--
whenever
he
chooses
to
do
it,
years
and
years
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
find
any
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
in
the
statutory
language,
would
it
then
make
more
sense
to
adopt
your
meaning
or
the
government's,
given
all
of
the
factors
that
the
government
argues
counsels
in
its
favor?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assume
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
federal
statute,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act,
entitles
employees
who
are
injured
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
to
receive
disability
benefits
from
their
employers.
the
amount
of
benefits
depends
on
both
an
employee's
preinjury
salary
and
the
severity
of
his
disability.
for
example,
a
totally
disabled
employee
is
entitled
to
receive
two-thirds
of
his
salary
as
long
as
he
remains
disabled,
but
the
act
also
set
some
maximum
rates
for
benefits.
the
maximum
rate
is
twice
the
national
average
weekly
wage.
that
national
average
weekly
wage
is
a
figure
calculated
by
the
secretary
of
labor
each
year
based
on
the
average
earnings
of
workers
across
the
country.
the
question
in
this
case
is
which
national
average
weekly
wage
is
used
to
determine
an
employee's
maximum
rate
of
compensation.
the
longshore
act
says
to
apply
the
national
average
weekly
wage
for
the
year
in
which
an
employee
is
"newly
awarded
compensation."
so,
the
precise
question
before
us
is,
when
is
an
employee
newly
awarded
compensation,
when
he
is
disabled
by
injury
or,
when
he
receives
a
formal
compensation
order
awarding
him
benefits?
in
2002,
petitioner
dana
roberts
was
injured
while
working
at
respondent's
sea-land
services
marine
terminal
in
alaska.
in
2007,
an
administrative
law
judge
or
alj
issued
a
formal
compensation
order
awarding
roberts'
benefits.
roberts
argued
that
his
maximum
rate
of
compensation
should
be
twice
the
national
average
weekly
wage
for
2007,
the
year
of
the
alj's
award.
instead,
the
alj
set
a
maximum
of
twice
the
national
average
weekly
wage
for
2002,
the
year
when
roberts
became
disabled.
the
department
of
labor’s
benefits
review
board
affirmed
the
alj's
decision,
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
so
do
we.
we
hold
that
employee
is
newly
awarded
compensation
when
he
first
becomes
disabled
and
thereby
becomes
statutorily
entitled
to
benefits
no
matter
whether
or
when
he
obtains
a
formal
compensation
order.
although
roberts'
interpretation
is,
at
first
blush,
appealing
only
ours
is
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the
longshore
act
and
leads
to
rational
results
in
its
administration.
the
act
requires
employers
to
pay
benefits
voluntarily
without
formal
orders
and
the
vast
majority
of
employers
do.
for
the
reasons
we
explain
in
our
opinion,
roberts'
readings
would
upset
this
system
and
would
lead
to
absurd
consequences
and
we
reject
it.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
