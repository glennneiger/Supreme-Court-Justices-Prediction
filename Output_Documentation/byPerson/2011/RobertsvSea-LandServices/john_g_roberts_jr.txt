chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-1399,
roberts
v.
sea-land
services.
mr.
gillelan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
--
one
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
that
i
thought
made
some
sense
was
the
idea
that
you
should
focus
on
a
particular
point
in
time
when
you
are
figuring
out
what
the
amount
of
the
award
is
going
to
be;
that
it
doesn't
make
--
that
it's
at
least
odd
to
say,
well,
we're
going
to
calculate
how
much
you're
entitled
to
at
this
point,
but
in
terms
of
the
applicable
maximum
we
are
going
to
wait
however
long
it
takes
and
calculate
that
as
of
this
point.
doesn't
it
make
more
sense
to
figure
out
the
applicable
numbers
at
the
same
point
in
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
think
--
if
we
think
the
statute
--
in
other
words,
your
argument,
your
response
is
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous
and
it
can't
be
read
in
a
more
sensical
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
you
have
been
waiting
the
longest.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you're
walking
down
the
street,
you're
on
a
business
enterprise,
they
haven't
shoveled
the
snow,
you
slip
and
fall
and
you're
hurt,
you
go
home
and
say:
good
news,
i've
been
awarded
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
doing
that
--
you're
doing
that
without
an
award.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
can
you
say
what
the
employer
pays
should
be
considered
an
award
if
it's
not
an
award?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
aren't
going
to
be
the
typical
cases,
i
think.
you
say
there
may
be
cases
and
i
suppose
there
may
be.
i
assume
what
happens
--
employers
don't
just
write
checks.
they
say
this
is
how
we
calculate
what
we
owe
you.
and
it
is
based
on
the
maximum
of
this
year,
not
any
future
ones,
and
if
the
employee
says
no,
no,
no;
i
have
a
right
to
get
the
--
then
the
employer
will
say
well,
okay,
i
either
agree
with
that
or
not,
but
you
don't
get
a
check.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
understand
the
amounts
at
issue
here.
what
is
the
usual
amount
that
is
at
stake
in
this
sort
of
case?
we
are
talking
about
the
concerns,
i
guess
on
both
--
about
gamesmanship,
but
how
much
difference
are
we
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know;
maybe
you
don't
have
statistics,
on
an
average.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
consequence
--
i
mean,
there
is
a
time
value
of
money,
too.
the
consequence
of
the
employee
saying,
i'm
going
to
wait
5
years,
because
i
think
the
maximum
is
going
to
be
a
lot
higher
is
that
he
doesn't
get
anything
in
the
meantime,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
reasonable
for
an
employer
to
say,
okay,
if
you
want
to
wait,
i'll
wait.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
palmore.
we
will
have
mr.
keisler
speak
for
a
bit.
mr.
kiesler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
way
it
is
used
in
914.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
how
much
of
a
practical
problem
is
this?
i
understand
the
amounts
are
here,
but
if
it's
five
years,
and
apparently
the
employee
was
happy
to
wait
five
years
to
get
an
award.
normally
if
you
are
an
employee
and
you
are
disabled,
and
the
employer
says,
well
here's
what
we
are
going
to
give
you,
and
it's
based
on
the
maximum
of
the
latest
we
have.
you're
not
going
to
say:
i'm
going
to
wait;
these
wages
are
going
to
go
up
nationally,
and
i'm
going
to
wait
a
year;
maybe
i'll
wait
for
years
because
i
think
there's
a
trend
on
national
average
wages,
and
i'm
going
to
cash
in
on
that;
i
am
going
to
be
without
money
for
the
next
four
years
and
i
am
disabled
but
--
i
mean,
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
to
be
a
plausible
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
i
mean
--
apparently
--
i
don't
know
what
the
employers
do,
but
usually
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
employers
have
good
lawyers
and
they
write
at
the
end
of
the
check,
you
know:
this
is
in
full
satisfaction
of
any
claims
under
the
--
the
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
maximum
always
go
up?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
theoretically,
it
can
go
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gillelan,
if
i
got
that
right,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
some
opinions
this
morning,
the
first
in
case
10-1399,
roberts
sea-land
services
--
roberts
versus
sea-land
services
by
justice
sotomayor.
