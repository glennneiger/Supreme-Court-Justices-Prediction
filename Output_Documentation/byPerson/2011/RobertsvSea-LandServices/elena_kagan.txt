but
i
thought
congress
wanted
the
system
to
operate
so
that
people
just
did
it
voluntarily
without
an
award.
justice
elena
kagan
all
right--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
think
the
way
the
argument
has
gone
so
far
is
that
we've
all
been
saying
this
can't
make
sense,
and
you
have
been
saying,
as
you
have
every
right
to
say,
yes,
but
this
is
what
the
statute
says
based
on
the
"newly
awarded"
language.
but
that
does
assume
that
"newly
awarded"
can't
mean
an
entitlement.
and
then
you
run
up
against
some
other
statutory
provisions
where
an
award
does
seem
to
mean,
not
a
formal
compensation
order,
but
instead
an
entitlement
to
funds.
so
908(d)(1),
it
seems
as
though
the
word
910(h)(1),
it
seems
as
though
the
word
933(b),
which
says
"award
in
a
compensation
order",
suggests
that
awards
can
be
made
in
a
formal
order
or
awards
can
be
made
differently
because
of
an
entitlement
that
is
automatically
paid.
so
i
guess
there
are
three
places
that
it
seems
to
me
your
reading
of
the
word,
your
limited
reading
of
the
phrase
"newly
awarded",
runs
into
problems
in
those
three
ways,
and
i'm
left
then
thinking
we
should
do
what
makes
sense.
justice

kagan
933(b),
908(c)(1)
and
910(h)(1).
justice
elena
kagan
and
in
what
percentage
of
the
cases
are
we
in
that
world?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
keisler,
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
this
language.
if,
according
to
justice
scalia's
old
opinion,
the
statute
awards
compensation
at
the
time
of
disability,
essentially
what
you
would
be
saying
is
that
an
employer
who
becomes
disabled
in
a
certain
year
is
awarded
compensation
at
that
time.
is
that
right?
