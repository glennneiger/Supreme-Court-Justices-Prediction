justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
two
parties
are
at
extremes
and
that
there
is
indeed
something
in
the
middle.
i
mean,
you
say
it
has
to
be
the
determination
of
entitlement
to
compensation
by
the
agency.
the
other
side
says:
no,
it's
just
entitlement,
whether
it's
been
decreed
or
not.
why
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
award,
however,
if
it
was
the
employer
that
voluntarily
paid
the
amount
due,
which
is
what
he's
supposed
to
do
anyway,
right?
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
award
of
compensation?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
a
sense
that
--
that
the
text
would
bear,
as
opposed
to
the
--
to
the
sense
that
the
other
side
argues
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
well,
i
wish
you
would
submit
the
sections
of
the
act
that
use
it
that
way,
that
say
compensation
without
an
award.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
he
doesn't.
no,
he
doesn't.
he
can
just
begin
payment.
the
--
(c),
which
is
the
section
we
are
talking
about
here,
doesn't
just
provide
for
newly
awarded
compensation.
it
also
says
"survivors
currently
receiving
compensation
for
permanent
total
disability
or
death
benefits.
"
"currently
receiving".
now,
does
that
mean
it
has
to
have
been
decreed
by
the
agency?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
it
--
but
it
applies
to
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
that
justice
ginsburg
asked,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
if
you
have
been
receiving
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
if
neither
the
employment
--
if
neither
the
employer
gives
you
the
compensation
voluntarily
nor
as
you
--
as
you
contend,
there
has
been
an
award
by
the
agency,
you
are
out;
(c)
doesn't
apply.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
else
would
it
apply?
you
are
either
receiving
compensation,
which
i
would
understand
to
mean
receiving
it
from
the
employer
or
by
reason
of
an
award,
or
else
you
have
been
newly
awarded
compensation,
which
i
guess
means
it
hasn't
yet
been
paid,
but
--
but
you
have
the
award
in
your
pocket.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that,
counsel.
it
says
"survivors
currently
receiving
compensation".
it
doesn't
say
by
virtue
of
an
award.
it
says
"receiving
compensation".
so
if
the
employer
is
paying
it
voluntarily,
you
are
in
there.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
it
contrasts
with
receiving
compensation
those
newly
awarded
compensation.
you
are
not
yet
receiving
it,
but
you
have
been
awarded
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
just
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
the
provision.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
sense
unless
you
read
it
just
the
way
i
suggested.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
nothing
about
an
award.
the
last
part
talks
about
an
award.
it
says
"currently
receiving
compensation
for
permanent
total
disability
or
death
benefits.
"
and
if
you
are
receiving
it
from
your
employer,
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
covered
by
that.
why
isn't
it
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
affects
your
case.
it's
just
a
matter
of
understanding
what
this
provision
is
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
employer
has
been
paying
voluntarily,
you
don't
penalize
the
employee
for
not
having
an
award,
right?
i
mean
he's
in
the
same
position;
the
employer
has
conceded
the
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
that's
so
only
for
employment
--
for
employer
payments
and
not
the
case
for
awards.
if
that's
so
for
the
employer's
payment,
why
isn't
it
so
for
awards
that
have
been
decreed?
why
don't
they
change
every
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
then
my
reading
makes
perfect
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
have
to
establish
that,
do
you?
all
you
have
to
establish
is
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
newly
awarded
compensation
means
entitlement
to
compensation.
that's
all
you
have
to
establish.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
show
that
it's
used
consistently
throughout,
only
that
it's
never
used
to
mean
entitlement
to
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
if
i
understood
your
response
to
my
prior
line
of
questioning,
you
deny
that
they
are
treated
differently.
the
one
who
is
receiving
compensation
is
treated
the
same,
under
the
same
provision.
there
are
two
parts
to
it:
survivors
currently
receiving
compensation
and
survivors
newly
awarded
compensation.
those
two
classes
are
treated
exactly
the
same.
the
only
one
that
is
treated
differently
is
somebody
who
is
neither
being
paid
by
the
employer
nor
has
yet
received
an
award.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
partial
disability,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
it
really
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
a
much
better
statute
had
it
been
written
differently.
and
really
your
argument
here
is
it's
not
up
to
us
to
revise
the
inadequacies
of
a
statute.
i
mean,
your
argument
is
you
just
can't
read
the
language
that
way.
and
it
provides
a
stupid
result.
and
there
are
such
things
as
stupid
statutes
and
this
is
one
of
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
could
i
ask
you
about
another
inconsistency
in
this
section?
we
have
gone
over
one,
which
i
think
is
there.
isn't
there
a
group
left
out
of
this
thing,
even
under,
even
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
it?
what
happens
to
people
who
are
receiving
compensation
for
temporary
total
disability
or
for
partial
disability?
they
don't
--
they
don't
come
under
either
one
of
those
two
categories,
even
under
the
government's
interpretation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
haven't
gotten
an
award
yet.
they
have
not
gotten
an
award
yet
and
they
are
only
partially
disabled
or
have
temporary
permanent
disability.
they
are
not
covered
by
(c),
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
right,
but
they
--
but
it
doesn't
take
effect--
justice
antonin
scalia
--during
that
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
but
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
serious--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you're
--
you're
making
your
case
harder
than
it
has
to
be,
it
seems
to
me,
by
saying
that
it
always
means
an
award
of
compensation
by
the
agency.
i
--
i
think
in
--
in
8(d),
i
don't
think
it
means
that,
but
it
certainly
means
an
amount
due
and
not
an
entitlement.
it
means
an
amount,
a
specific
amount
due.
and
that
explains
its
meaning
elsewhere,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
it
means
entitlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
that's
true,
but
only
because
of
the
earlier
portion
of
6(c)
which
--
which
covers
all
other
payments
that
are
not
by
virtue
of
an
award,
receiving
compensation.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
about
how
the
scheme
works.
grant
you
that
it
makes
a
lot
more
sense
your
way,
but
will
you
grant
that
it's
not
up
to
us
to
rewrite
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
"awarded"
in
that
provision
can
bear
the
meaning
that
you
want
to
give
it.
let's
assume
that
congress
passes
a
--
a
new
statute
providing
for
tax
credits
for
--
for
each
child,
okay?
my
wife
gives
birth
to
a
child
just
before
christmas,
and
i
say:
oh,
goody;
i've
been
awarded
$2,000.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
that's
not
a
normal
use
of
the
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
entitled
to
it
under
this
statute.
but
when
the
event
of
having
a
child
occurs,
i
don't
say:
$2,000>
["].
you
might
say
it
analogously.
i
mean,
you
know:
oh,
hey,
i've
been
awarded
$2,000.
but
that's
analogous.
and
statutes
are
not
written
by
analogy;
they're
written
to
say
what
they
say.
and
i
don't
know
anybody
that
would
use
the
term
"awarded"
the
way
you
want
it
used.
the
chief
justice's
example
is
another
one:
oh,
good,
i've
been
awarded
damages.
you
haven't
been
awarded
damages.
you're
entitled
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
go
through
those.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
--
you
show
me
how
--
i
agree
with
you
that
they
don't
mean
the
entry
of
an
award
by
the
agency,
but
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
only
--
only
reading
you
can
give
them
is
entitlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
933
of
the
gray
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
give
me
a
minute.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
language
is
important,
isn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
language
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
true.
and
what
that
means
is
that
it
can
be
considered
an
award
if
you've
gotten
it
from
the
employer
voluntarily.
that
is
still
an
award
of
compensation.
that's
all
that
that
last
sentence
proves.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
yes.
yes.
i
agree
he's
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
i
think
he's
persuaded
me
that
in
--
in
the
section
we're
talking
about,
subsection
(c),
the
only
meaning
left
for
"award"
is
an
award
by
the
agency,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
--
but
you
have
to
show
me
one
other
provision
at
least
where
the
only
meaning
you
can
give
"award"
is
entitlement
to
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
(h)(1)?
justice
antonin
scalia
"upward
adjustments
to"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"compensation
to"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
does
"awarded
compensation
at
less
than
the
maximum
rate.
"
mean?
i'm
not
sure
what
that
refers
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
you
entitled
to
get
the
maximum?
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
right,
it
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
you
can
speak
of
the
statute
as
awarding
something.
but
when
you
use
the
phrase
"newly
awarded"
you
are
not
referring
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
you
are
referring
to
the
time
at
which
the
person
qualifies
under
the
statute.
and
i
don't
know
any
usage
of
that
sort
that
a
person
--
well,
you
know,
when
my
wife
has
a
baby,
"i
have
been
awarded
money".
you
haven't
been
awarded
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
what
you
say.
but,
i
don't
know
any
common
usage
that
employees
the
term--
justice
antonin
scalia
--give
me
your
example
again
of
award
used
as
--
a
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no;
not
from
the
statute.
you,
you
--
24--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
wasn't
--
you,
you
gave
another
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
an
example
you
made
up
out
of
your
fertile
imagination
which
seemed
to
me
pretty
good.
i
forgot
it.
i
will
get
it
from
the
transcript.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but
i
didn't
say
in
that
opinion
that
the
--
the
employer
in
--
in
that
cases
--
or
whoever
it
was
that
was
entitled
within
the
statute
--
was
"newly
awarded"
it.
i
agree
the
statute
awards
it,
but
when
you
say
somebody
is
"newly
awarded",
you're
talking
about
an
event
at
that
time.
and
that's
--
that's
a
different
usage.
