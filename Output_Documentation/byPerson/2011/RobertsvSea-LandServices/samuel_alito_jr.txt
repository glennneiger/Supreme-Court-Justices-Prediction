justice

are
you
conceding
in
answer
to
these
questions
that
your
reading
doesn't
really
make
any
sense,
that's
just
what
congress
--
that's
what
congress
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
sense
does
it
make?
why
should
the
ceiling
depend
on
whether
an
employee
is
getting
compensation
voluntarily
from
the
employer
or
as
a
result
of
a
formal
award?
if
you
have
two
identical,
identically
situated
employees
and
one
is
getting
the
compensation
without
an
award
and
one
is
getting
it
with
an
award,
as
you
understand
the
term
"award",
why
--
what
sense
does
it
make
to
treat
them
differently?
