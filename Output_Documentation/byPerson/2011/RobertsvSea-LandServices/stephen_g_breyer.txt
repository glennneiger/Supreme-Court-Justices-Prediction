stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
then
go
back
--
i
did
have
the
same
question
justice
alito
asked
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer.
the
answer
has
--
i
will
add
one
footnote,
perhaps,
which
might
make
it
a
more
complete
answer,
and
that
is
that
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
me
when
a
worker
becomes
disabled
on
january
1,
1990,
for
example,
he
is
now
disabled.
and
so
we
calculate
what
his
wage
was.
his
wage
was
$200
a
week.
and
now
we
say,
but
that
shouldn't
exceed
twice
the
average
weekly
wage,
and
we
are
not
going
to
apply
it
to
him.
you
are
going
to
apply
it
to
him
at
some
random
date.
his
wage
that
he
is
getting
paid
is
figured
out
as
of
january
1,
1990.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
maximum
that
it
could
be
is
figured
out
as
of
january
1,
1998,
when
he
finishes
a
proceeding.
now,
i
just
--
for
both
reasons,
why
would
you
distinguish
and
why
would
you
get
that
result?
for
those
two
reasons
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
much
sense
to
me,
your
reading
of
it,
while
theirs
does
make
sense.
now,
you
explain
why
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
it
is
not
stupid
because
you
think
it
is
a
good
idea
to
give
a
lot
of
work
to
the
department
of
labor
and
that
all
the
employers
are
going
to
do
this
voluntarily
and
there
will
never
be
a
problem
with
it;
all
should
be
encouraged
to
go
and
get
a
certificate
from
the
department
of
labor.
all
right.
i
will
take
that
as
something.
now,
why
is
it
i
can't
read
the
statute
the
way
that
it
seems
to
make
somewhat
more
sense?
i
don't
see
any
words
here
that
stop
me
from
reading
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
exactly?
you
mean
in
(c)?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
told
me
that
just
this
had
to
do
with
permanent
or
total
disability,
and
this
is
far--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
don't
they
both?
i
mean,
as
i
read
it
naturally,
it
says
that
--
we
now
have
a
special
thing,
you
know,
which
these
people
are
the
dead
ones
and
the
widows
are
getting
it
and
the
permanently
disabled
people,
and
the
--
this
individual,
and
the
secretary,
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
is
going
to
calculate
this
thing
all
the
time,
and
they've
got
a
special
thing
here
for
--
for
--
for
permanent
people,
permanently
disabled,
and
they
are
saying
as
to
those
people,
we
are
giving
them
a
break.
they
can't
look
for
more
work.
they
can't
look
for
--
they
are
dead,
for
example,
and
they
can't
find
other
sources
of
income.
and
so
we
say
that,
that
if
the
average
wage
goes
up
and
their
wage
was
higher
to
begin
with,
we
will
raise
it
a
bit.
and
that
applies
not
only
to
the
people
who
are
just
getting
this
for
the
first
time
in
the
relevant
period;
it
also
applies
to
all
those
who
have
been
getting
it.
it
applies
to
both
groups.
well,
that
makes
sense
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
the
whole
thing
applies
just
to
the
permanently
disabled
and
the
death
things.
what
says
it
applies
to
anybody
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
whole
thing.
the
whole
--
the
whole
--
all
of
(c),
that's
in
my
thing
here
that's
seven
lines.
all
of
(c)
applies
to
permanently
disabled
and
those
who
died.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
yes.
oh.
i
feel
slightly
like
an
abbott
and
costello
movie,
but
i
am
getting--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see.
is
your
argument
this
now
--
i'm
sorry
to
be
so
slow.
but
that,
look,
there
is
a
statute
here
that
says
compensation
cannot
exceed
more
than
200
percent
of
the
annual
or
weekly
wage,
then
in
(3)
it
says
how
to
calculate
that
particular
number.
and
then
you
guy
over
to
(c)
and
(c)
says
that
calculated
number
applies
to
those
newly
awarded
compensation.
and
you're
saying
"newly
awarded
compensation"
means
somebody
got
it
through
an
award,
not
somebody
got
it
automatically.
and
since
somebody
got
it
--
had
to
get
it
through
an
award
or
it
wouldn't
apply
when
you
just
get
it
because
they
pay
for
it,
it
just
doesn't
apply.
you
have
to
go
get
the
award,
and
the
word
you
are
turning
on
is
"newly
awarded".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
abbott
and
costello,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
but
i
do
--
i
do
--
i
was,
i
was
--
now
i
fully
understand
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens,
just
for
my
technical
knowledge
here,
the
--
the
employee
suffers
partial
disability
on
february
1.
he
then
doesn't
notify
the
employer
until,
let's
say,
february
10,
and
then
the
employer
waits
for
a
week
or
so,
and
then
begins
to
pay.
now
is
the
employer
supposed
to
calculate
the
--
the
weekly
wage
that
he's
paying
on
in
the
week
february
1
to
february
10
--
or
3
days
he
puts
it
aside.
but
--
the
first
week?
or
does
he
do
it
on
the
first
week
he
got
notice?
how
is
that
--
how
does
that
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
but
i'm
saying
he
has
to
write
the
check
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
wage
could
have
changed
in
those
few
weeks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
week
he
didn't
get
the
notice,
then
the
second
week
he
did
get
the
notice.
which
week
does
he
calculate
the
payment
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
can't
--
we
cannot
read
this
thing
"award"
to
mean
award
by
the
employer.
we
can't
read
it
to
mean
award
by
the
--
by
the
government,
in
your
view.
we
have
to
mean
it
to
mean
the
time
that
he
became
entitled
to
some
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
tough
thing
is
saying,
well,
that
that's
an
award.
that's
what
this
case
turns
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
you
pointed
to
in
the
statute
is
you
pointed
to
some
situations
which
say
we
have
situation
3
and
4,
and
they
are
not
present
here.
but
in
situation
3
or
4,
award
does
mean
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
don't
have
another
example
of
a
--
of
a
situation
where
award
did
mean
--
so
you
are
saying
there
are
some
others
where
award
doesn't
mean,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
there
anything
--
what
is
the
most
analogous
thing
you
can
find
anywhere
where
award
has
referred
to
the
time
that
a
person
became
entitled
to
a
thing,
prior
to
the
time
anyone
was
--
became
obliged
to
give
him
some
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
that
time
first
was
the
period
for
--
way
for
calculating
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
910(h)(1).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
don't
do
it
again.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
awarded
was
awarded
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
can
do
it.
you
can
say
it's
the
time
that
the
statute
awards
him
the
compensation.
that's
the
english
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
the
statute
that
is
doing
the
awarding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
about
the
business,
was
newly
awarded
the
tax
credit
at
the
time
they
made
the
deduction.
