mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
interpretation
of
section
906,
which
hinges
entirely
on
the
date
of
an
administrative
compensation
order,
renders
that
provision
impossible
to
apply
in
the
many
cases
expressly
contemplated
by
the
act
in
which
there
is
no
such
order.
that
interpretation
also
creates
arbitrary
distinctions
between
beneficiaries'
benefit
levels
based
on
administrative
happenstance.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
the
statute
provides
for
the
award
of
damages,
and
i
think
this
is
--
this
--
the
key
to
this,
understanding
how
this
scheme
works,
is
understanding
section
914
and
section
913.
these
are
at
page
17a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it's
absolutely
not
up
to
you--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--to
rewrite
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
it's--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
justice
kagan
highlighted
three
provisions
where
the
statute
does
in
fact
use
the
word
"award"
to
indicate
a
statutory
entitlement.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i'd
be
glad
to,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
justice
--
to
start
with,
section
933,
which
is
at
page
24a
of
the
government
appendix.
this
is
one
of
the
sections
highlighted
by
justice
kagan.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
of
the
gray
brief.
933(b)
says:
"acceptance
of
compensation
under
an
award
in
a
compensation
order
filed
by
the
deputy
commissioner
will
have
certain
consequences.
"
that
expressly
contemplates
--
this
is
page
24a,
justice
scalia.
sorry.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
okay.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
page
24a
of
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
okay.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
so
the
first
sentence
says:
"acceptance
of
compensation
under
an
award
in
a
compensation
order--
"
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
"--
filed
by
the
deputy
commissioner
shall
have
certain
legal
consequences--
"
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
aren't
important
here.
that
sentence,
even
read
by
itself,
suggests
there
can
be
an
award
that's
not
in
a
compensation
order.
moreover--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--the
last
sentence
says:
"for
purposes
of
this
subsection"
--
not
the
purposes
of
the
entire
act
--
"for
purposes
of
this
subsection,
term
"award"
with
respect
to
a
compensation
order
means
a
formal
order
issued
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
the
administrative
law
judge.
"
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
it
contemplates
--
it
certainly
precludes,
i
think,
petitioner
--
petitioner's--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
the
actual
--
the
actual
receipt
interpretation
that
your
honor
is
advancing
is
not
one
that's
been
advanced
in
this
case.
it
would
have
extraordinarily
--
extraordinary
practical
difficulties
and
application
would
be
really
inconsistent.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i'd
like
to
try
--
i'd
like
to
try
to
convince
you
otherwise.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
think
section
910(h)(1),
another
provision
cited
by
justice
kagan,
is
another
example.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
(h)(1).
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
at
15a.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
this
is
a
very
complicated
provision,
but
what's
important
to
note
here
is
that
congress
made
--
this
was
congress's
attempt
to
provide
additional
benefits
to
beneficiaries
whose
disabilities
commenced
before
1972.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
they
make
a
critical--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i'm
sorry.
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief.
the
specifics
aren't
as
important
as
the
use
of
the
phrase,
and
it's
one,
two
three,
four,
five
lines
from
the
bottom,
"or
his
survivor
was
awarded
compensation
as
the
result
of
death.
"
so
it
makes
a
key
determinant
for
figuring
out
how
these
adjustments
are
going
to
be
made
whether
someone
was
awarded
compensation
prior
to
october
27th,
1972.
there's
no
indication
here,
and
it
would
make
no
sense
to
suggest,
that
congress
meant
to
distinguish
between
people
who
had
a
formal
compensation
order
and
those
who
didn't.
i
think
--
but
if
i
could
go
back
to
section--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that's
his
answer
on
some
of
the
other
provisions--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
but
here,
here
there'd
be
no
reason
for
someone
to
go
in
and
get
a
compensation
order,
because
these
are
long-past
disabilities,
and
congress
was
simply
creating
a
rule
for
how
to
true-up
these
past
beneficiaries
and
provide
them
additional
benefits.
but
i
think
if
you--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--there
was
an
old
maximum.
prior
to
1972,
there
was
a
$70
maximum.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
okay.
so
if
someone--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes.
but
some
people
--
two-thirds
of
their
average
weekly
wage
resulted
in
a
figure
below
the
maximum,
right.
so
for
those
people,
what
section
910(h)(1)
did
was
said
if
you
were
awarded
compensation
at
less
than
the
prior
maximum,
you
were
going
to
get
an
inflation
adjustment.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
for
everyone
else
who
was
already
at
the
maximum,
they
got
a
new,
statutorily-created
time
of
injury,
which
was
itself
significant
that
congress
went
--
used
that
route.
but
there's
no
indication--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--it
doesn't
make
sense
under
petitioner's
reading.
i
think
it
does
make
sense
under
our
reading.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
okay?
and
if
you
go
to
page
17a,
i
think
these
are
the
key
provisions
for
understanding
how
section
906
works
in
the
statutory
scheme.
section
914,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
--
17a
to
the
government's
brief
--
provides
that:
"employers
must
pay
compensation
without
a
compensation
order
promptly,
as
soon
as
they
have
notice
of
an
injury.
"
(b),
which
is
on
the
next
page,
18a,
says
that
the
first
payment
has
to
come
in
14
days,
within
14
days
of
notice
of
the
injury,
"unless
the
employer
controverts
liability".
so
if
i'm
an
employer
and
i
have
an
employee
who's
injured,
i've
got
to
get
out
my
checkbook
on
day
14
and
start
writing
checks.
i
need
to
know
what
number
to
fill
in.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
because
if
you
don't
consider
that,
then
the
--
the
statutory
provision
is
impossible
to
apply.
because
then
it's
unclear
--
and
i
haven't
heard
petitioner
answer
what
the
statutory
maximum
is
--
if
that
employee
who
gets
his
first
check
after
14
days
has
not
been
newly
awarded
compensation--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
use
of
"award"
clearly
means
compensation
order,
and
i'm
not
here
to
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
statute
never
uses
the
word
award
to
mean
compensation
order.
often
it
does,
and
in
this
case
that
provision
does.
but
the
larger
point
is
that
that
employer--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--has
to
start
payments
in
14
days,
and
he
has
to
know
what
statutory
maximum
applies.
under
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute,
there
is
no
answer
to
that
question,
because
that
employee
has
not
been
newly
awarded
compensation,
so
section
906(c)--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--it's
a
--
in
a
substantial
majority
of
cases
no
claim
is
ever
filed,
justice
kagan.
page
38
of
the
red
brief
points
to
legislative
history
before
congress
in
1972
which
demonstrated
that,
and
that
remains
the
case.
this
is
a
workers'
compensation
--
team
--
that
encourages
employers
to
pay,
which
without
administrative
compulsion.
it's
supposed
to
be
simple
to
apply.
the
employer
is
supposed
to
know
how
much
to
write
that
check
for
at
the
time
he
writes
that
first
check,
after
the
14
days.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
absolutely.
they
have
a
statutory
right
to
controvert.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
newly
awarded
compensation.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it's
again
a
reading
that
hasn't
been
advanced
in
this
case
but
i
understand
your
honor's
question
and
your
honor's
point.
i
think
that
reading
of
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
because
there
may
be
many
cases
when
the
employer
will
write
one
or
two
checks
and
then
stop.
there
made
be
cases
in
which
the
employer
will
write
a
check
for
the
wrong
amount;
there
will
later
be
a
dispute
about
what
the
proper
benefit
level
would
be.
so
i
think
you'd
develop
a
whole
new
body
of
case
law
and
controversy
about
what
it
meant
for
the
employer
to
have
paid--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
the
--
the
employer
will
need
to
protect
itself
by
writing
that
check
unless
it's
going
to
controvert
liability.
justice
ginsburg
pointed
to
one
of
petitioner's
arguments
that
this
provides
an
incentive
for
employers
not
to
controvert
liability
when
they
don't
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
doing
so,
but
section
938
of
the
act
provides
for
attorneys
fees
in
that
situation
so
there
is
already
a
remedy
for
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
can
give
you
this
case
as
an
--
as
an
illustration.
so
in
this
case
the
petitioner's
disability
began
in
2002,
so
our
view
is
that
that
was
when
he
was
initially
awarded
compensation
so
the
2002
maximum
of
$966
applies.
petitioner's
view
is
that
because
he
received
a
formal
compensation
order
in
2007,
the
2007
maximum
applies,
this
1,114,
so
it
can
make
a
considerable
difference.
i
think,
though,
that
petitioner
recognizes--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that's
right.
the
larger
point
though
is
that
in
many
cases
in
which
compensation
is
paid
without
compulsion
of
a
compensation
order,
an
employee
never
files
a
claim.
section
913
expressly
contemplates
that
by
saying
that
an
employee
has
1
year
in
which
to
file
a
claim
from
an
injury
unless
he
has
been
receiving
payments,
in
which
the
time
runs
from
the
last
payment
received.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
he
needs
to
provide
--
he
needs
to
make
a
payment
within
14
days.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
right.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it's
from
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--from
when
the
disability
commenced.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
but
you're
not--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
is
our
submission,
justice
breyer.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
as
we've
--
as
i
was
discussing
earlier
we
--
sometimes
do
awards
that
way.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
i
think
if
i
can
show
you
--
if
i
can
show
you
--
there
are
some
cases--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
think
there
are--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
think--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
910(h)(1)
is
that
example--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--and
i
hesitate
to
go
back
into
the
weeds
of
that
provision.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
but
the
first
sentence
says
--
it
talks
about
those
who
were
entitled
to
total
permanent
disability
or
death,
which
commenced,
so
it
talks
about
commencement
of
entitlement.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
and
then
later
it
uses
awarded
compensation.
if
i
could
go
back
quickly
to
the
claim--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--okay.
i
think
we
address
this
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief.
it's
the
commencement
of
entitlement
to
disability
benefits,
which
is
almost
always
going
to
be
when
disability
itself
commences.
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
there
is
an
idiosyncratic
set
of
cases
in
which,
if
a
disability
lasts
more
than
3
days
but
fewer
than
14,
you
are
not
compensated
for
those
first
3
days.
so
under
that
unusual
it
would
be
day
4,
but
the
employer
who
writes
that
check
at
day
14
is
going
to
know.
that's
--
that's
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
--
justice
breyer.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--to
make
his
--
i
think
petitioner
has
developed
kind
of
a
procedural
work-around
to
the
--
the
problem
created
by
his
interpretation
the
statute,
which
is
if
he
needs
a
compensation
order
in
every
case
to
make
the
scheme
make
sense,
to
get
compensation
order
he
needs
a
claim
in
every
case.
and
as
the
colloquy
before
reflected,
the
way
he
can
get
a
claim
in
every
case,
because
in
many
cases
the
claims
are
not
filed
today,
is
that
the
employer
must
threaten
the
disabled
employee
to
cut
off
benefits
if
that
employee
doesn't
file
a
claim.
threaten
to
controvert
liability
when
that
employer
has
no
good
faith
basis
for
doing
so.
all
to
get
the
employee
to
file
a
claim
that
the
claim
--
that
the
employee
doesn't
think
is
necessary,
to
get
a
compensation
order
which
serves
no
other
purpose
than
to
trigger
this
maximum
rate
provision.
that
is
contrary
to
the
way
this
statute
is
supposed
to
work.
the
statute
is
supposed
to
encourage
amicable
agreement
between
employers
and
employees
to
avoid
administrative
process
and
the
gearing
up
of
the
administrative
machinery
wherever
possible.
and
petitioners
proffered
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
absence
of
a
compensation
order
in
every
case
is
contrary
to
that
of
the
entire
thrust
of
the
longshore
act
as
a
workers'
compensation
scheme.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
attorneys'
fees
and
interest,
both
of
which
are
generally
applicable
remedies
that
apply
to
cases
that
don't
implicate
the
statutory
maximum
or
the
statutory
minimum.
petitioner's
solution
using
his
reading
of
the
statute
to
deal
with
employer
delays
over-inclusive
and
under-inclusive.
it
is
over-inclusive
because
it's
going
to
deal
with
cases
in
which
there
hasn't
been
delay
by
any
responsibility
by
an
employer,
but
there's
been
administrative
delay,
there's
been
the
dispute.
but
it's
also
under-inclusive
in
that
it
only
deals
with
those
small
number
of
cases
that
deal
with
the
statutory
maximum
or
minimum.
