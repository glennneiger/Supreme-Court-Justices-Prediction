mr.
paul
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
before
this
court
is
the
narrow
issue
of
whether
a
corporation
can
ever
be
held
liable
for
violating
fundamental
human
rights
norms
under
the
alien
tort
statute.
under
respondents'
view,
even
if
these
corporations
had
jointly
operated
torture
centers
with
the
military
dictatorship
in
nigeria
to
detain,
torture,
and
kill
all
opponents
of
shell's
operations
in
ogoni,
the
victims
would
have
no
claim.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
there
--
there
are
a
couple
of
questions
within
that.
mr.
paul
hoffman
it
does.
yes.
[laughter]
and
--
and
let
me
start
by
saying
that
the
international
human
rights
norms
that
are
at
the
basis
of
this
case
for
the
plaintiffs
--
crimes
against
humanity,
torture,
prolonged
arbitrary
detention,
extrajudicial
executions
--
all
of
those
human
rights
norms
are
defined
by
actions.
they're
not
defined
by
whether
the
perpetrator
is
a
human
being
or
a
corporation
or
another
kind
of
entity.
and
so,
i
think
that
the
--
the
respondents
are
wrong
when
they
say
that
international
law
does
not
extend
to
--
to
those
kinds
of
acts.
they
do
--
it
does.
and
the
united
states
agrees
with
that
position.
what
they
have
tried
to
--
to
conflate
is
the
question
about
whether
international
law
--
the
international
law
norms
apply
to
a
corporation
or
a
person
with
whether
there's
a
--
an
international
consensus
with
respect
to
how
those
norms
should
be
enforced,
particularly
within
domestic
civil
jurisdiction
as
opposed
to
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
there's
a
distinction
made
within
the
jurisdiction
of
certain
modern
international
criminal
tribunals.
and
respondents
take
their
position
too
far
in
this,
because
what
they've
said
is
that
the
fact
that
corporations
can't
be
found
liable
criminally
under
the
international
criminal
court,
for
example,
means
that
the
norms,
the
underlying
norms
--
genocide,
crimes
against
humanity,
and
war
crimes
when
it
comes
to
the
international
criminal
court
--
don't
apply
to
corporations.
and
that's
--
that
clearly
is
wrong
because
the
united
kingdom
and
netherlands,
for
example,
the
two
home
countries
of
--
of
these
corporations
has
passed
domestic
implementing
legislation
that
imposes
criminal
penalties
for
violations
of
those
very
norms.
so,
there's
no
question
that
it
can
be
done.
what
the
most
important
--
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
principles
in
this
case
is
that
international
law,
from
the
time
of
the
founders
to
today,
uses
domestic
tribunals,
domestic
courts
and
domestic
legislation,
as
the
primary
engines
to
enforce
international
law.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
the
--
there
are
two
parts
to
--
to
my
answer
to
that.
one
is
that
the
alien
tort
statute
is
a
--
is
a
unique
way
of
enforcing
the
law
of
nations,
in
terms
of
the
way
that
the
founders
married
tort
law
and
violations
of
the
law
of
nations.
in
the
international
human
rights
amicus
brief,
the
amicus
brief
of
international
human
rights
organizations,
at
pages
18
to
22,
there's
a
whole
series
of
cases
where
the
domestic
courts
and
domestic
legislation
of
various
states
around
the
world
have
addressed
those
kinds
of
issues.
and
so,
there
isn't
an
exact
analogue
to
the
alien
tort
statute,
but
there's
no
question
that
domestic
legislation
and
domestic
courts
have
taken
on
these
kinds
of
issues.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
let
me
address
the
--
i
think
this
comes
under
the
general
rubric
of
extraterritoriality.
mr.
paul
hoffman
i
believe
that
they
--
that
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
paul
hoffman
i
think
that
they
could
be
brought
in
holland
or
the
united
kingdom
for
events
in
nigeria.
i
think
that
the
cases
that
are
discussed
as
those--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--i
don't
know
if
this
precise
case
could
be
brought.
i
know
that
the
--
we
have
a
principle
of
transitory
torts,
and
so,
one
--
and
i
believe
other
countries
have
that
principle
as
well.
so,
in
terms
of
the
underlying
tort
action,
we
have
plaintiffs
who
are
u.s.
residents
and
were
u.s.
residents
when
they
filed
this
case.
they
found
a
tortfeasor
within
the
united
states
that
they
believe
was
responsible
for
these
torts,
and
from
mostyn
v.
fabrigas
and
before,
mostyn
v.
fabrigas
being
the
1774
case
by
lord
mansfield
talking
about
transitory
tort,
the
courts
clearly
have
the
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
those
kinds
of
tort
claims.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
that
--
that
issue
has
been
raised
in
a
number
of
the
briefs.
i
would
say
two
things:
one
is
that
that
doesn't
really
go
to
the
question
about
whether
corporations
can
be
categorically
excluded
from
alien
tort
statute
coverage,
which
is
really
the
issue
that
--
that
was
decided
by
the
court
below
and
which
was
the
question
presented
here.
extraterritoriality
has
to
do
with
a
different
kind
of
issue.
i
would
argue
that
--
i
mean,
we've
obviously
argued
that
that's
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
briefed
on
its
own.
but
there
is
no
international
law
principle
that
i
am
aware
of,
and
i
think
it
would
need
to
be
proved,
that
says
that
the
united
states
congress
was
disempowered
at
its
founding
from
providing
these
kinds
of
tort
remedies.
and
it
was
clear
from
the
founding
that
the
founders
at
least
believed
that
this
statute
would
be
extraterritorial.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
it
was
motivated
by
the
marbois
incident
and
a
similar
incident
to
--
with
regard
to
a
dutch
ambassador
in
new
york
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention.
but
if
--
if
the
court
looked
to
the
bradford
incident
--
the
incident
about
which
attorney
general
bradford
expressed
his
opinion
in
1795,
which
was
an
opinion
that
this
court
found
very
important
in
terms
of
--
of
interpreting
the
alien
tort
statute,
the
bradford
opinion
had
to
do
with
an
assault
on
the
british
colony
in
sierra
leone.
and
so,
it
was
not
only
extraterritorial
in
the
sense
of
piracy,
and
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
--
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
deal
with
piracy
and
maritime-related
violations
of
the
law
of
nations.
it
--
the
bradford
opinion
there
said,
even
though
u.s.
criminal
jurisdiction
was
limited,
the
civil
jurisdiction
under
the
alien
tort
statute
provided
that
the
corporation
that
--
whose
property
was
attacked
within
the
territory
of
sierra
leone--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--the
bradford
opinion?
mr.
paul
hoffman
i'm
not
sure
in
which
sense.
i
mean,
the
--
yes,
the
--
i
think
that
the
bradford
opinion
has
been
used--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--well,
i
think
--
i
don't
recall
specifically.
i
know
that
there
has
been
some
controversy
about
whether
that
was
an
attack
in
the
high
seas.
i
know
there's
some
scholarship
about
that.
what
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
if
the
court
went
back
to
the
original
documents
that
that
the
--
that
were
sent
to
attorney
general
bradford
which
--
from
the
british
government,
i
think
the
court
would
find
that
--
that
this
attack
actually
took
place
in
the
territory
of
sierra
leone.
and
so,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we've
suggested
that
--
that
--
that
the
extraterritoriality
issue
deserves
full
treatment
if
the
court
is
troubled
by
it,
in
a
case
where
there
is
full
briefing,
because
in
this
case
it
was
raised
by
the
--
by
--
by
the
respondents'
amici
largely,
although
the
respondents
have
raised
it,
and
there
--
the
historians
that
have
expressed
opinions
on
corporate
liability
and
others
that
would
be
interested
in
this
question
have
not
been
able
to
put
the
other
side
before
the
court.
and
i
think
there's
a
very
--
there
are
very
important--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--well--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--well,
the
alien
--
if
i
could
start
with
the
second
part
first.
the
alien
tort
statute
certainly
was
passed
to
do
that,
but
also
as
an
expression
of
the
nation's
commitment
to
international
law,
i
think
primarily
as
a
--
as
statement
of
this
country's
commitment
to
international
law
as
a
new
member
of
the
community
of
nations.
and
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
incidents
like
the
marbois
incident
or--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--i
think
that
what
--
i
think
the
question
would
have
been,
is
there
a
law
of
nations
violation?
for
example,
in
the
marbois
incident,
say
the
--
marbois
was
--
was
attacked
by
longchamps
outside
the
united
states,
but
longchamps
came
to
take
refuge
in
the
united
states,
and
the
french
government
said
you
have
somebody
living
in
your
country
that
has
attacked
our
ambassador
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
i
think
the
united
states
--
i
think
the
same
principle
--
the
united
states
would
have
wanted
to
do
something
for
the
french
government
in
response
to
that,
because
it
would
have
been
giving
refuge
to
someone
who
had
violated
the
law
of
nations.
and
--
and
the
same
principle
has
been
applied
in
the
modern
era
to
--
to
giving
no
safe
haven
to
torturers
and
others.
mr.
paul
hoffman
a
lot
of
the
extraterritoriality
issues
would
apply
to
the
cases
that
this
court
endorsed
in
sosa.
mr.
paul
hoffman
and
those
issues,
generally
speaking,
are
resolved
by
other
doctrines
rather
than
an
exclusion
of
corporations
categorically
from
the
statute.
mr.
paul
hoffman
i
was
--
the
only
thing
i
was
going
to
add
to
that
is
that
a
doctrine
like
forum
non
conveniens
or
personal
jurisdiction
would
deal
with
the
issues
about
whether
this
is
the
most
appropriate
forum.
and
those
doctrines
apply
whether
it's
an
alien
tort
statute
case
or
it's
a
common
law
tort
case.
these
plaintiffs
could
bring
this
case
in
state
court.
what
the
alien
tort
statute
does
is
provide
a
federal
forum
when
these
torts
are
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
and
that's
really
what
it
--
what
the
founders
intended
and
what
--
and
what
it
does.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
hoffman
if
there
aren't
any
further
questions
right
now,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
hoffman
thank
you.
let
me
just
make
a
few
quick--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--there
are
a
number
of
--
of
differences
between
the
tvpa
and
--
and
the
alien
tort
statute
apart
from
that.
i
mean,
for
example,
the
alien
tort
statute
applies
to
a
much
broader
range
of
international
human
rights
violations.
congress
decided
to
legislate
in
those
areas
for
the
reasons
that
it
decided
to
do
that.
the
one
thing
that's
clear,
as
--
as
justice
kagan
said,
is
that
the
torture
victim
protection
act
was
designed
to
--
to
establish
the
--
or
to
make
even
stronger
the
filartiga
precedent,
and
shielded
from
analyses
that
challenged
its
bases,
and
was
--
was
not
intended
to
restrict
the
alien
tort
statute
in
any
way.
and
obviously,
the
next
case
will
discuss
in
greater
detail
whether
the
tvpa
applies
to
corporations
or
not.
if
--
i
don't
know.
if
i
could
just
make
a
couple
of
additional
points.
if
--
if
it
was
true
that
international
law
barred
corporate
liability,
then
our
friends
the
united
kingdom
and
netherlands
have
violated
international
law
by
passing
legislation
that
imposes
criminal
liability
on
corporations
for
violating
genocide
crimes
against
humanity,
and
war
crimes.
and
i
think
that
brief
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
whatever
they're
saying,
that
--
if
--
if
the
alien
tort
statute
is
a
domestic
enforcement
of
international
law,
then
their
views
don't
apply.
and
--
and
--
and
this
is
a
tort
statute.
that's
--
there
was
a
meaning
to
torts.
skinner's
case,
for
example,
was
a
tort
not
only
under
english
common
law,
it
was
--
it
was
a
tort
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
it
was
robbery
on
the
sea.
the
law
of
nations
was
incorporated
in
english
common
law
just
as
it
was
in
the
founding
in
our
country.
and
under
the
peck
heyday,
it
is
still
a
part
of
our
land
--
the
law
of
our
land.
"tort"
meant
to
the
founders
"tort
remedies".
it
meant
--
it
meant
that
the
means
of
enforcement
would
be
done
by
the
common
law.
that's
all
that
was
available
then,
it's
all
that's
available
now.
and
--
and
international
law
places
no
restriction
on
the
way
domestic
jurisdictions
enforce
international
law.
there
is
a
general
principle
law
of
corporate
civil
liability
for
all
of
the
things
that
we
allege
in
this
case.
in
every
legal
system
in
the
world,
one
can
get
redressed
for
this
kind
of
thing.
countries
don't
necessarily
call
it
a
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
they
didn't
fashion
the
statute
the
way
our
founders
did
for
the
reasons
that
they
did--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--no,
no.
if--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--well,
what
i'm
suggesting
--
i
don't
know
whether
in
every
domestic
jurisdiction,
the
extraterritoriality
issue
is
taken
in
this
same
way.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
for
these
kinds
of
acts,
you
can
get
redress
against
the
corporation
within
every
legal
system.
now,
not
every
legal
system
--
i
don't
know
every
legal
system
with
respect
to
the
extraterritoriality
issue.
mr.
paul
hoffman
well,
what
--
what
--
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
international
law
does
not
distinguish
with
respect
to
actor,
at
least
in
--
with
respect
to
these
four
norms,
if
we're
going
by
a
norm-by-norm
basis.
these
acts
--
these
norms
are
defined
in
ways
that
human
beings
and
corporations
can
violate.
privilege--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--the
lower
courts
have
treated
it
in
different
ways.
i
think
that
most
of
the
courts
now
have
found
that
aiding
and
abetting
is--
mr.
paul
hoffman
--i
think
that
--
that
aiding
and
abetting
could
be
viewed
as
a
conduct
regulating
norm,
that
it
actually
applies
to
the
things
that
can
be
done
to
violate
the
norm.
and
therefore,
international
law
would
apply
to
that.
i
think
my
--
my
time
is
up.
