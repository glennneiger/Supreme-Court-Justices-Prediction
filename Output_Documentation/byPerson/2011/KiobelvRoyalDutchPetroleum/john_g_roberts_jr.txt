chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1491,
kiobel
v.
royal
dutch
petroleum.
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
began
by
--
by--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
--
if
there
is
no
other
country
where
this
suit
could
have
been
brought,
regardless
of
what
american
domestic
law
provides,
isn't
it
a
legitimate
concern
that
allowing
the
suit
itself
contravenes
international
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
was
motivated,
i
gather,
by
assaults
on
ambassadors
here
within
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
whether
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
under
international
law,
it
is
critically
pertinent
who's
--
who's
undertaking
the
conduct
that
is
alleged
to
violate
international
norms.
if
an
individual
private
group
seizes
a
ship,
it's
piracy.
if
the
navy
does
it,
it's
not.
governmental
torture
violates
international
norms.
private
conduct
does
not.
so,
why
doesn't
the
--
why
isn't
the
same
pertinence
--
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
all
you
need
to
do
is
find
an
event,
torture,
piracy,
whatever,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
domestic
law
whether
or
not
particular
entities
can
be
sued.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
a
statement
of
your
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
work
when
you're
talking
about
state
--
whether
it's
a
state
conducting
the
illegal
conduct
or
somebody
else.
so,
why
--
that's
not
up
to
the
domestic--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
getting
ahead
of
yourself.
we
haven't
decided
that
question
just
yet.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hoffman,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
--
in
every
nation
in
the
world,
you
can
get
redress
for
this
sort
of
thing.
but
i
thought
you
told
us
earlier
that
there
was
no
place
where
this
suit
could
be
brought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
other
words,
a
suit
by
an
--
an
alien
against
another
alien
for
conduct
that
takes
place
overseas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
gets
back
to
your
basic
submission,
which
is
you
define
the
international
norm
based
on
the
act
rather
than
the
entire
issue
that's
going
to
be
litigated,
which
includes
both
remedy
and
actor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
term
in
case
10-1491,
kiobel
v.
royal
dutch
petroleum.
mr.
hoffman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose,
if
you
have
--
i
suppose,
if
you
have,
as
i
think
there
probably
is
in
this
case,
a
number
of
plaintiffs,
they
can
sue
in
a
number
of
different
countries,
right?
some
will
sue
in
the
united
states,
others
in
the
united
kingdom,
others
in
the
netherlands?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can.
ms.
sullivan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
was
the
most
clear
violation
of
an
international
norm.
the
one
thing
that
the
civilized
countries
would
agree
on
is
that
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--capture
pirates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
have
we
crossed
that
--
we've
crossed
that
bridge
already,
didn't
we,
in
sosa?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
presumption
applies
to
interpreting
acts
of
congress.
we
are
over
that.
we're
--
we're
making
this
law
up
ourselves,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
sullivan.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
successors
may
adopt
a
different
view.
and
i
think
--
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth,
but
justice
scalia's
point
means
whatever
deference
you
are
entitled
to
is
compromised
by
the
fact
that
your
predecessors
took
a
different
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hoffman
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
united
kingdom
and
netherlands
don't
think
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
