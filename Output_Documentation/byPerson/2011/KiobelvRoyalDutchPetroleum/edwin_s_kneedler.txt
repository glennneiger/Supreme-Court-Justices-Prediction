mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
categorical
ruling
that
a
corporation
may
never
be
held
liable
under
the
alien
tort
statute
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
norm,
the
locus
of
the
wrong,
or
the
involvement
of
the
state.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
the
difference
is
really
a
matter
of
degree.
i
mean,
under
respondeat
superior
liability,
a
corporation
is
normally
responsible,
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
agents.
judge
posner
in
the
seventh
circuit
flomo
decision
suggested
that
in
the
nature
--
in
this
category
of
cases,
assuming
that
the
ats
would
allow
a
common
law
cause
of
action
for
conduct
in
another
country,
that
maybe
there
should
be
more
limited
respondeat
superior
limited
principles
because
the
action
would
occur
in
circumstances
were
the
corporation
sought
to
be
held
liable
may
not
have
much
--
much
control
over
it.
where
the
corporation
itself
is
liable
--
and
this
would
be
true
in
criminal
law
and
presumably
in
--
in
tort
law
--
would
usually
require
some
action
by
those
responsible
for
running
the
corporation
or
high
enough
up
the
chain
of
command--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
policy--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
think
it's
both.
particularly
the
latter,
but
i
think
the
former
as
well.
as
mr.
hoffman
said,
international
law
norms
proscribe
certain
conduct,
but
the
enforcement
of
that
is
left
to
each
nation.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
sovereigns,
a
sovereign
could
not
be
held
liable
for
--
at
least
for
conduct
outside
the
united
states,
because
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
that's
--
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
amerada
hess
case.
within
the
united
states,
if
a
foreign
sovereign
committed
a
tort,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
subject
to
certain
limitations,
would
allow--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
court
in
amerada
hess
did
hold
that,
that
--
and
it
made
an
important--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
made
a
point
that
is
important
to
this
case
as
well.
it
said
that
while
the
alien
tort
statute
identifies
who
the
plaintiff
must
be
--
the
plaintiff
must
be
an
alien
--
it
does
not
identify
who
the
defendant
may
be,
and
that
if
there
are
limitations
on
who
the
defendant
may
be,
from
other
sources
of
law
and
foreign
sovereign
immunity
would
be
one
of
them,
then
the
suit
could
not
go
forward
against
the
foreign
sovereign.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
first
looking
at
footnote
20
in
--
in
sosa,
it
--
what
the
footnote
says,
that
a
related
consideration,
meaning
related
to
whether
the
particular
norm
satisfies
the
criteria
in
sosa,
is
whether
international
law
extends
the
scope
of
liability
for
a
violation
of
a
given
norm
to
the
perpetrator
being
sued.
if
the
defendant
is
a
private
actor
such
as
a
corporation
or
individual--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
--
because
the
state
actor
aspect
of
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
conduct.
does
the
conduct
itself
violate
the
norm?
i
think
it's
a
--
but
beyond
that,
it's
enforcement.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
alien
tort
statute
uses
the
word
"tort".
and
it's--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
goes
to
whether
the
defendant
can
be
sued,
the
sovereign
immunity
does.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
there
is
no
independent
prohibition
in
international
law
or
domestic
law
against
suing
a
corporation
the
way
there
is
for
a
foreign
sovereign.
to
the
contrary--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
to
the
contrary,
at
the
time
the
alien
tort
statute
was
adopted,
corporations
could
be
held
liable.
this
court's
decision
in
chandler
recently
surveyed
the
--
the
law
and
corporations
could
be
held
liable
in
tort.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because
that
goes
to
the
definition
of
the
norm.
but
if
we
--
if
we
take
--
if
we
take
the
alien
tort
statute,
in
1907,
the
attorney
general
concluded
that
an
irrigation
company
could
be
sued
for
violating
a
treaty.
if
we
take
the
examples
that
gave
rise
to
the
alien
tort
statute,
if
a
process
serving
company
--
if
one
of
its
agents
went
into
an
ambassador's
house
and
tried
to
serve
process,
that
was
a
criminal
violation
at
the
time.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
question
of
extraterritorial
application
is
distinct
from
the
question
of
whether
a
corporation
can
be
held
liable.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
our
--
our
position
is
straightforward.
just
as
you
said,
the
question
of
whether
a
corporation
should
be
held
liable
we
think
should
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
ats
refers
to
torts.
and
in
applying
--
this
question
we
think
is
not
complicated.
in
fashioning
federal
common
law
to
decide
whether
there
should
be
a
common
law
cause
of
action,
the
ats's
reference
to
tort
law,
i
think,
directs
the
court
to
domestic
tort
law,
and
the
question
of
whether
a
corporation
can
be
held
liable
under
domestic
tort
law.
and
it
clearly
can
be.
it
could
be
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
it
can
be
today.
