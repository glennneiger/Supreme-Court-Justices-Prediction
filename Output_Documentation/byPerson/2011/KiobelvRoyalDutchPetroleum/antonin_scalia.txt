justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
--
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
we
--
we
would
not
hold
foreign
sovereigns
liable
under
this
act,
that
they're
excluded
despite
--
despite
its
language;
and
yet,
we
cannot
inquire
whether
persons
other
than
sovereigns
are
covered.
what
is
--
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
more
specific
than
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
it
deals
with
a
much
more
narrow
category
of
case.
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
would
be
interpreted
to
eliminate
the
sovereign's
liability,
if
indeed
this
statute
provided
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
--
i
didn't
understand
the
point
you
just
made,
that
the
sovereign
immunity
part
goes
to
--
to
the
conduct?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
the
corporate
thing
go
precisely
to
the
same
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
could
--
could
pass
a
statute
to
that
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether
this
did
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
position
--
what's
your
position
on
aiding
and
abetting?
is
that
--
is
that
a
matter
of
our
domestic
law
or
--
or
would
--
would
we
track
international
law
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
about
the
courts.
i
care
about
you.
what's
your
position
on
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
--
is
there
some
super
body
that
decides
what
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
particular
norms
of
international
law?
that
is
to
say,
these
other
countries
that
have
jurisdiction,
they
decide
for
themselves,
don't
they,
what
--
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
international
norm
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
national
courts
have
been
the
deciders
when
--
when
the
violation
occurs
within
the
nation.
but
to
give
national
courts
elsewhere
the
power
to
determine
whether
a
united
states
corporation
in
the
united
states
has
violated
a
norm
of
international
law
is
something
else,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
general
--
general
common
law
was
not
considered
to
be
federal
law,
neither
federal
law
nor
state
law.
if
that
were
so,
every
tort
action,
which
in
those
days
were
decided
under
--
under
a
general
law
that
was
up
there
in
the
sky,
would
have
been
a
federal
--
a
federal
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
common
law.
it's
general
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
isn't
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
when
they
do
so
they
are
enforcing
federal
law
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
sullivan,
can
i
ask
you
about
your
position
on
extraterritorial
application.
i
believe
strongly
in
the
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application,
but
do
you
know
of
any
other
area
where
extraterritorial
application
only
means
application
on
the
territory
of
a
foreign
country
and
not
application
on
the
high
seas?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
--
you
know,
extraterritorial
means
extraterritorial,
but
--
but
you
contend
that
this
--
as
i
think
you
must
--
that
this
statute
applies
on
the
high
seas.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
don't?
okay.
i
thought
that
was
common
ground.
i'm
glad
to
know
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
that's
the
worst.
but
i
really
don't
--
you
appeal
to
the
general
principle
of
territoriality
of
our
laws.
and,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
any
other
case
where
that
principle
allows
our
securities
laws
to
be
applied
on
the
high
seas,
for
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
they
can
apply
in
australia.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
do
you
mean
that
the
courts
--
in
those
areas
where
you
acknowledge
the
statute
applies,
that
the
courts
will
not
apply
doctrines
of
exhaustion,
of,
you
know,
comity,
of
the
appropriateness
of
bringing
the
action
here?
of
course
they
will,
won't
they.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
verrilli,
the
--
that's
--
that
is
a
new
position
for
the
--
for
the
state
department,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
--
and
for
the
united
states
government?
why
should
--
why
should
we
listen
to
you
rather
than
the
solicitors
general
who
took
the
opposite
position
and
the
position
taken
by
respondents
here
in
other
cases,
not
only
in
several
courts
of
appeals,
but
even
up
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
--
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
the
responsibility
of
your
predecessors
as
well,
and
they
took
a
different
position.
so,
you
know,
why
--
why
should
we
defer
to
the
views
of
--
of
the
current
administration?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
--
we
are
not
very
good
at
figuring
out
the
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states.
and,
you
know,
in
the
past
we
have
tried
to
get
out
from
under
our
prior
case
law
in
the
sovereign
immunity
area
of
asking
the
state
department.
and
the
state
department
would
come
in
here:
this
is
good;
this
is
bad.
we
abandoned
all
that
in
the
sovereign
immunity
field.
why
should
we
walk
back
into
it
here?
or
do
you
intend
to
have
us
make
these
foreign
policy
decisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
assuming
congress
doesn't
act.
why
should
--
you
know,
you
want
us
to
listen
to
the
state
department
case
by
case.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
we
listen
to
the
state
department
as
to
what
those
categories
ought
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
have
been
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
rather
listen
to
the
dutch
government
than
one,
one
dutch
judge,
frankly.
