mr.
kneedler,
could
you
explain
to
me
the
--
the
difference
between
respondeat
superior
liability
and
corporate
liability?
in
--
in
the
briefs
there
seems
to
be
an
assumption
that
respondeat
superior
liability
is
--
is
permissible,
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
corporate
liability
is.
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two
doctrines?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
all
the
reasons
justice
kagan
mentioned,
that
the
tvpa
is
not
a
limiting
source,
and
can
be
viewed
as
a
supplemental
source.
but
there
does
appear
to
be
a
little
bit
of
incongruity,
that
aliens
can
sue
corporations
for
acts
against
other
aliens,
but
american
citizens
under
the
tvpa
might
not
be
able
to
sue
corporations.
how
do
we
deal
with
that
under--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
the
amicus
brief
from
the
european
commission.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it
provides
for
a
very
simple
rule.
please
explain
to
me
what's
wrong
with
it?
it
basically
says
you
have
to
borrow
both
the
substantive
and
procedural
international
law
norms;
that
those
norms
do
permit
these
foreign-cubed
cases
only
so
long
as
either,
it
appears
to
me,
the
defendant
is
a
citizen
of
the
country,
the
acts
occurred
within
that
country,
or
the
alien
has
exhausted
both
domestic
and
international
avenues
for
relief,
a
sort
of
forum
by
necessity,
which
apparently
most
countries
have,
including
the
ones
who
have
submitted
amici
arguing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--different
points,
like
england
and
the
netherlands.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
to
me
like
a
fairly
simple
set
of
rules
clearly
defined
and
limiting
the
application
of
this
statute
in
a
way
that
sort
of
makes
sense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
wrong
with
the
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
answer
me
why
is
this
not
the
case
where
on
the
facts
there
has
been
a
failure
to
exhaust.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
it
matters
that
the
harboring
is
after
the
fact
or
not?
meaning
if
the
mercenary
fled
france
and
was
hiding
from
the
french
here,
why
is
there
any
less
chance
of
a
war?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand.
the
apples
and
apples
don't
--
seem
to
not
match
in
my
mind.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
pirates
could
have
been
sued
in
state
court,
too,
and
yet
the
ats
--
i
know
that
you
quarrel
about
whether
an
act
of
piracy
qualifies
as
an
international
norm,
but
assuming
that
i
accept
it
is,
pirates
could
have
been
--
under
your
theory,
pirates
could
have
been
sued
in
state
court,
too,
yet
congress
found
it
important
to
pass
the
ats.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
asking
us
to
overturn
our
precedents.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
basically
saying
filartiga
and
marcos,
sosa,
they
were
all
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
how
can
you
say
that?
maybe
the
facts
didn't,
but
certainly
the
reasoning
of
the
case
addressed
that
issue
very
directly
and
--
and
basically
said
it
does.
and
then
it
talked
about
how
you
limit
it.
that's
what
sosa
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
the
same
--
is
that
your
simple
rule?
is
that
how
you
want
us
to
rule--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
there
could
never
be
aiding
and
abetting
on
behalf
of
a
corporation?
is
that
your
simple
answer
to
this
case,
or
what's
the
general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
are
disavowing
any
forum
of
necessity
view
of
the
ats?
you
are
disavowing
what
other
countries
do
or
say
with
respect
to
citizens
--
to
aliens
who
are
attacked?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
asked
you
a
question
directly.
are
you
foregoing
--
are
you
foregoing
any
forum
necessity
exception
to
the
rule
you've
just
announced?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
talking
about
a
nexus
test?
that's
what
it
sounds
like
to
me.
has
to
have
either
an
actor
nexus
or
a
act
nexus,
effect
nexus?
what
are
you
talking?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
either
it
exists
or
it
doesn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
having
trouble
with
this.
without
question,
piracy,
attacks
on
ambassadors,
we
know
that
those
were
international
norms
in
1789.
if
one
of
those
acts
happened,
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that,
answering
justice
kagan's
hypothetical,
that
if
a
frenchman
attacks
an
english
ambassador
in
switzerland,
that
case
would
never
be
heard
in
the
united
states
because
there
is
no
nexus
to
the
united
states;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
assuming
someone
came.
so
how
is
that
different
from
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
presence
alone
in
the
united
states
a
connection?
