ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
first
question.
justice
kennedy
asked
and
justice
breyer
renewed
the
question,
is
there
any
source
in
customary
international
law
throughout
the
world
that
holds
corporations
liable
for
the
human
rights
offenses
alleged
here?
and
the
answer
is
there
is
none.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
not
a
case--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
yes,
the
corporation
would
not
be
liable.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
corporation
would
not
be
liable.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
--
look
to
justice
story
in
u.s.
v.
smith,
cited
in
the
respondents'
brief
at
footnote
12.
it
looks
to
piracy.
and
piracy
is
allowed
--
in
rem
actions.
you
could
seize
the
ship
with
which
the
piracy
was
committed,
as
you
could
later
slave
trading
ships.
but
you
could
not
seize
another
ship,
and
you
could
not
seize
the
assets
of
the
corporation.
so,
piracy--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
let's
be
clear
that
sosa
referred
to
specific
norms.
so,
the
answer
to
pirates,
inc.,
does
not
determine
the
answer
in
this
case,
which
is
about
whether
corporations
can
commit
post-nuremberg
human
rights
offenses.
a
given
norm
must
be
applicable
to
a
corporation.
so,
even
if
i
gave
you
pirates,
inc.,
it
wouldn't
decide
this
case.
but
in
fact
pirates,
inc.,
was
not
suable;
it
was
the
ship
that
could
be
seized.
but
to
answer
your
honor's
question
about
the
genocide
convention,
perhaps
i
could
go
back.
i
want
to
be
very
clear:
we're
not
arguing
there
needs
to
be
an
international
adjudicated
case
finding
a
corporation
liable
in
order
for
petitioners
to
win,
but
they
have
failed
to
show
anything
in
the
conventions,
the
non-binding
treaties
engaged
in
by
multiple
nations.
they
failed
to
show
anything
in
custom
or
practice.
they
failed--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--but,
justice
kagan,
international
law
does
speak
to
who
may
be
liable,
which
you
correctly
identified
as
a
substantive
question,
not
a
question
of
enforcement.
and
international
law
holds
corporations
liable
for
some
international
law
violations.
look
to
the
convention
on
the
suppression
of
the
financing
of
terrorism,
which
speaks
about
legal
entities,
or
the
convention
on
bribery
of
public
officials,
which
speaks
about
legal
persons.
but
the
human
rights
offenses
here
do
not
arise
from
conventions
like
those
which
allow
corporate
liability.
to
the
contrary.
the
human
rights
offenses
here
arise
from
conventions
that
speak
to
individual
liability.
the
liability
of
individuals.
and,
justice
breyer,
in
precise
answer
to
your
question
about
the
convention
on
genocide,
if
you
look
to
the
chevron
brief
on
page
20
--
this
is
the
amicus
brief
of
chevron
filed
by
professor
goldsmith.
on
page
20,
it
quotes
in
full
the
relevant
passage
from
the
genocide
convention,
article
iv.
i'm
sorry
there
are
many
briefs,
but
perhaps
if
i
could
read
it
to
your
honors,
i
will
read
it
in
full.
it
says
that
"persons
committing
genocide
or
any
of
the
other
acts
enumerated
in
article
iii
shall
be
punished
whether
they
are
constitutionally
responsible
rulers,
public
officials
or
private
individuals.
"
and
justice
kagan,
all
the
other
relevant
conventions
also
speak
about
natural
persons.
the
convention
against
torture
speaks
about
him,
not
it.
and
when
congress,
in
the
one
time
it
implemented
the
conventions
that
are
the
source
of
the
human
rights
offenses
that
are
alleged
here,
congress
in
the
torture
victim
protection
act
said
that
the
suit
may
be
brought
against
individuals.
and
it
expressly
declined
to
use
the
term
"persons",
which
could
embrace
corporations.
and
we've--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
a
corporation
could
sue
if
it
were
an
alien,
and
if
you
decided
the
alien
embraced
corporations.
and
of
course,
the
attorney
general
bradford
opinion
from
1795,
which
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice,
extended
--
and
with
justice
alito
--
did
not
extend
to
conduct
in
other
countries;
it
extended
only
to
conduct
on
the
high
seas.
but
bradford
--
the
bradford
opinion,
if
you
give
it
any
credit,
only
establishes
that
a
corporation
may
be
a
plaintiff.
it
does
not
speak
to
the
question
here,
which
is
whether
a
corporation
may
be
a
defendant.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
you
would
say
that
because
there
is
no
assaulting
ambassador
norm
that
applies
to
corporations.
i
just
want
to
go
back
and--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--exactly.
exactly.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
burden
rests
on
the
petitioners
to
show
that
the
norm
is
established
by
international
law;
not
on
us
to
show
that
corporate
liability
is
any--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--could
absolutely.
congress
tomorrow,
justice
scalia--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--this
did
not.
and
what
international
law
has
not
established
--
not
just
through
cases,
justice
breyer,
but
through
any
source,
convention,
or
custom
--
if
you
look
to
the
jurisdictional
statutes
of
the
icc
--
the
rome
statute--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kagan,
let's
be
clear
to
separate
two
very
different
causes
of
action.
there
is
no
country,
and
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
first
question,
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
that
provides
a
civil
cause
of
action
against
a
corporation
under
their
domestic
law
for
a
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
in
mr.
hoffman's
hypothetical,
if
there
were
a
suit
in
england
or
in
the
netherlands,
it
would
be
for
assault
and
battery,
wrongful
death,
or--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they
are
meaningfully
different
from
individuals
under
international
law
which
is
the
crucial
choice
of
law
question
that
you
need
to
answer
here.
the
crucial
question
that
is
at
the
threshold
is
which
law
determines
whether
corporations
are
liable.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
let
me
be
clear.
the
question
is
not
"could".
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
corporate
liability,
even
for
norms,
on
which
the
international
community
agrees
--
torture,
genocide,
piracy,
slavery
--
corporate
liability
is
a
substantive
norm
that
is
established
by
international
law.
and
the
nations
of
the
world,
for
various
reasons,
have
treated
individuals
and
corporations
differently.
and
justice
kennedy,
over
and
over
and
over
again,
it's
not
just
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
17
but
the
u.k.
netherlands
brief,
two
of
our
most
important
allies,
filed
a
brief
of
respondents,
saying
at
pages
11
through
15:
there
is
no
international
norm
applicable
to
corporations
for
violations
of
the
human
rights
offenses
here.
now
the
international
community
has
many
reasons
for
this.
in
1998
when
our
own
statute
established
the
icc,
the
signatories
actually
discussed
whether
to
have
criminal
liability
for
corporations;
and
as
the
scheffer
amicus
brief
in
support
of
petitioners
points
out
at
page
18,
they
actually
also
discussed
civil
liability
for
corporations.
and
the
nations
of
the
world
who
created
the
icc,
one
of
the
most
important
modern
instruments
for
bringing
about
human
rights
prosecutions,
declined
to
embrace
jurisdiction
over
corporations.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
justice
kennedy,
there's
many
reasons.
for
one,
a
corporation
involves
many
innocent
stakeholders
beyond
the
perpetrators.
and
the
regime
established
at
nuremberg,
if
it
established
nothing
else,
established
that
it
is
individuals
who
are
liable
for
human
rights
offenses.
it
pierced
to
the
notion
of
hiding
behind
a
state
abstract
entity,
and
held
individuals,
including
individual
businessmen
from
alfred
krupp
to
28
officials
indicted
from
the
i.g.
farben
firm.
but
nuremberg
was
about
individual
liability.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
i.g.
farben
was
dissolved
by
the
control
counsel
law
number
9
in
1945.
it
was
a
political
act.
it
preceded
any
of
the
tribunals,
either
international
or
national.
it
was
not
until
later
that
year
that
the
international
military
tribunal
began.
it
prosecuted
no
corporations.
when
the
allies
prosecuted
perpetrators
of
the
nazi
horrors
in
later
cases,
they
prosecuted
again
only
individual
officers,
not
any
corporations.
there
are
two
amicus
briefs
on
the
nuremberg
history:
one
in
support
of
petitioners,
filed
by
jennifer
green,
and
one
in
support
of
neither
party
filed
by
jonathan
massey.
both
of
them
agree
on
one
proposition,
and
that
is,
that
no
corporation
was
prosecuted
by
either
the
international
military
tribunal
in
1945
and
46
nor
in
any
of
the
subsequent
u.s.
tribunals.
in
fact,
in
u.s.
v--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
to
answer
your
question,
when
i.g.
farben
was
dissolved,
it
was
part
of
denazification,
decartelization,
and
a
distraction
of
the
nazi
war
machine
of
which
i.g.
farben
was
an
integral
part.
it
was
practically
viewed
as
an
enemy
state
in
and
of
itself.
that
is
a
prece
--
so
the
precedent
of
nuremberg,
like
the
precedent
of
the
icty,
the
ictr,
the
icc,
all
exclude
liability
for
corporations,
even
for
the
most
heinous
offenses
of
the
modern
era.
they
focus
liability,
rather,
on
corporate
officers.
and
justice
kagan,
we
don't
dispute
that
corporate
officers
can
be
held
to
account
for
these
offenses
assuming,
justice
alito,
that
we
don't
have
concerns
about
extraterritoriality
even
as
to
individuals.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kagan,
you
should
look
at
questions
of
corporate
liability.
like
questions
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
like
questions
of
individual
private
liability
as
opposed
to
state
actor
liability.
you
should
look
at
all
of
those
questions
as
substantive
questions
answered
by
international
law.
and
that's
because
footnote
20
of
sosa
says
you
look
to
whether
international
law
extends
liability
to
the
perpetrator
being
sued.
you
can't
just
find
an
act
out
there
and
fan
out
to
anyone
in
the
entire
world,
including
consumers
pumping
gas
in
ohio,
and
say
there's
been
an
act
of
international
law
violation.
it's
a
question
is
proof.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
it
is
not.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
respectfully,
justice
kagan,
we
disagree.
the
question
of
who
may
be
sued
is
fundamentally
part
of
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
a
tort
committed
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
it
would
read
the
verb
"committed"
out
of
the
statute.
if
you
just
said
find
a
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
anywhere
and
then
apply
it
to
whoever
you
want.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kagan,
we
respectfully
disagree.
that
is
a
question
of
substantive
law.
think
about
a
domestic
analogy.
look
to
the
restatement
of
conflicts.
you
would
ask
whether
--
you
would
not
look
to
foreign
law
to
determine
a
question
of
respondeat
superior
or
contribution
or
indemnity.
you
would
not
look
to
foreign
law
to
determine
whether,
in
the
words
of
the
restatement,
one
person
is
liable
for
the
tort
of
the
other.
you
would
look
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
misconduct
or
the
place
of
where
the
corporation
is
headquartered.
foreign
law
determines
in
this
case
whether
you
had
could
have
civil
remedies
rather
than
criminal.
we
concede
that
the
ats
allows
a
civil
remedy
where
the
world
would
impose
only
criminal
liability.
that's
because
civil
liability
versus
criminal
liability,
that's
a
matter
of
remedy.
so
would
be
the
amount
of
damages.
so
would
be
the
choice
of
compensatory
or
punitive
damages.
those
are
matters
of
remedy
for
domestic
law
to
decide.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
ginsberg,
respectfully,
we
don't
think
the
world
is
all
of
one
when
it
comes
to
issues
of
corporate
responsibility
for
the
acts
of
its
agents.
if
you
look
at
the
icj
--
sorry,
if
you
look
at
the
rome
statute,
the
rome
statute
itself
has
very
particular
sections
about
when
an
--
a
corporate
superior
is
liable
for
the
actions
of
a
corporate
inferior.
it
looks
to
a
knowledge
and
deliberate
indifference
standard.
not
every
nation
of
the
world
agrees
on
what
standard
must
--
there
must
be
for
even
attributing
the
agent's
act
at
the
bottom
of
the
corporate
hierarchy
to
a
senior
officer,
much
less
to
the
corporation
as
an
entity.
in
answer
to
your
question
about
--
earlier
about
respondeat
superior,
justice
kagan,
the
only
way
a
corporation
can
do
anything
is
through
the
acts
of
human
beings;
thus
there
is
always
the
question
when
it
comes
to
corporate
liability
to
ask
how
to
attribute
the
action
of
the
human
beings
who
work
for
the
corporation
to
the
corporation.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
sosa
footnote
20
commits
that
question,
as
does
the
ats
itself,
to
international
law.
yes?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
kennedy,
i
agree
completely
on
what
may
be
very
clear
on
one
thing.
i've
addressed
only
step
one
of
sosa,
which
is,
does
international
law
provide
for
a
specific
universal
and
obligatory
norm
of
corporate
liability.
it
does
not.
in
fact
it
refutes
it.
the
rome
statute
rejected
liability
for
corporations.
the
jurisdictional
statutes
of
the
icty
and
the
ictr
apply
jurisdiction
only
to
natural
persons.
the
international
community
at
step
one
has
rejected
it.
but
justice
kennedy,
it's
very
important
that
sosa
puts
a
second
screen
into
your
inquiry.
you
must
ask
if
the
second
step
--
even
if
international
law
had
provided
any
source
of
corporate
liability,
which
it
does
not,
you
would
still
have
to
ask:
footnote
30
of
sosa
says
it's
a
higher
bar.
should
federal
common
law,
should
federal
common
law
now
embrace
these
kinds
of
actions?
and
the
answer
is
no.
even
if
you
found
this
were
a
question
of
domestic
remedy,
we
think
you
cannot
--
this
is
a
question
of
substance.
but
even
if
this
were
a
question
of
--
domestic
remedy,
you
should
not
find
liability
for
corporations
for
the
same
reasons
you
rejected
corporate
liability
in
malesko.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
ginsburg,
respectfully
we
disagree,
and
so
do
all
the
courts
of
appeals
who
have
addressed
the
question
of
aiding
and
abetting
liability.
every
court
of
appeals
save
one,
including
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
dc
circuit,
which
disagreed
with
us
on
the
outcome,
said
that
the
question
of
whether
international
law
prohibits
liability
for
aiding
and
abetting
is
to
be
determined
by
international
law.
the
second--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
your
honor.
that
was
under
english
tort
law,
1666.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
you
may--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
first
we
disagree
that
the
question
of
who
may
be
sued
is
a
question
of
enforcement.
we
think
that
bridge--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--was
crossed
in
sosa.
and
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
ginsburg,
in
all
the
cases
that
hold,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
agree
that
who
may
be
liable,
just
primary
actors
or
also
aiders
and
abetters,
is
determined
by
international
law
as
a
question
of
substance.
so
we
disagree
with
the
premise.
but
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
the
federal
common
law
still
should
not
fly
in
the
face
of
congress,
and
i
think
the
important
question
in
your
hypothetical
is
who
is
the
"you"?
as
justice
scalia
just
pointed
out,
congress
could
amend
the
ats
tomorrow
to
provide
for
a
federal
common
--
a
federal
statutory
cause
of
action
against
corporations.
but
the
one
time
congress
spoke
to
the
very
question
at
issue
here,
it
held
the
diametric
opposite.
congress
in
the
tvpa
rejected
corporate
liability
by
choosing
the
term
"individuals"
rather
than
"persons".
and
i
realize,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
the
next
case,
but
we
think
there
is
really
the
answer
that
the
tvpa
excludes
corporations
is
compelled,
and
the
u.s.
agrees.
so
your
honor,
the
question
is
not
what
should
federal
courts
do
in
the
abstract,
it's
what
should
federal
courts
do
when
there
is
exact
statutory
decisionmaking
by
the
political
branches
that
has
gone
the
other
way.
in
maritime
law
in
miles
v.
apex,
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
decide
to
go
contrary
to
congress
in
the
jones
act;
you
said
if
there
is
a
jones
act
statutory
statement
about
wrongful
death,
we
should
follow
it
in
federal
common
law.
similarly
here,
even
if
the
international
community
thought
there
was
anything
to
corporate
liability
--
which
it
doesn't,
it
disagrees;
our
two
allies
the
u.k.
and
netherlands
disagree,
and
germany
has
filed
a
brief
saying
it
also
disagrees
with
the
ats
as
it
has
been
applied
--
even
if
there
was
international
consensus,
you
would
still
have
to
ask
should
the
federal
courts,
through
free-form
federal
common
law
making,
do
the
opposite
of
what
congress
is
saying?
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
the
ats
has
language
that
says
the
tort
must
be
committed
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations.
so
although,
justice
ginsburg,
it
doesn't
specify
who
may
be
the
defendants,
it
does
point
us
to
the
law
of
nations
to
figure
out
what
the
law
of
nations
thinks
about
who
may
be
the
defendants,
and
the
law
of
nations
is
uniform.
it
rejects
corporate
liability.
so
to
find
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
here
is
to
fly
in
the
face
of
both
the
international
community,
with
all
the
foreign
policy
consequences
justice
kennedy
referred
to
earlier,
if
as
mr.
--
as
the
chief
justice
said
earlier,
the
point
of
the
ats
was
to
stop
war,
by
making
sure
there
was
a
forum
for
the
marbois
incident,
so
that
france
wouldn't
think
it
had
to
go
to
war
on
us
to
stop
the
offense
ti
its
sovereignty
--
but
it
will
it
provoke
war
to
out
ahead
of
the
international,
foiling
the
purpose
of
the
ats.
but
also,
and
this
is--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
respectfully,
we
--
we
accept
that
the
united
states
here
before
you
today
doesn't
speak
to
the
foreign
--
foreign
policy
consequences
of
this
kind
of
ats
liability.
and
we
haven't
even
gotten
to
the
alternative
ground,
justice
alito
and
the
chief
justice
referred
to
earlier,
which
is
charming
betsy
canon
says
don't
lightly
construe
your
law
to
offend
international
law.
but
just
back
to
the
--
the
--
the
united
states,
i
respectfully
suggest
you
should
look
to
the
tvpa,
rather
than
simply
to
what
the
united
states
says
here
today.
and
the
tvpa,
which
is
congress
interpreting--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
far
--
it's
--
it's
one
of
many
sources,
your
honor.
just
to
go
back
to
the
key
point
about
international
community.
the
international
community
--
justice
breyer
says
don't
just
look
for
adjudicated
opinions,
but
every
convention
for
every
international
tribunal
excludes
corporations.
look
to
the
u.n.
process.
the
petitioners
make
a
great
deal
out
of
the
u.n.
process
that's
taken
place
since
2007.
we
cite
the
u.n.
special
representative,
saying
"i
have
looked
at
the
international
human
rights
instruments
that
are
out
there,
and
i
find
no
basis--
"
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--"for
corporate
liability".
that's
the
u.n.,
not
congress.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
read
first
of
all
the
rome
statute,
1998,
and
the
legislative
history.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
read
--
but
the
rome
statute
also
rejected
civil
liability.
that's
in
the
scheffer
brief.
the
scheffer
amicus
brief.
he
was
our
representative
there,
and
he
said
civil
liability
was
considered
but
rejected.
so
the
rome
statute
rejected
either
corporate
or
criminal
liability
for
corporations
under
the
new
icc.
the
icc
--
the
icty,
the
convention
against
torture
itself,
and--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
--
we
agree
that
there's
no
civil
liability
for
human
rights
offenses.
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
at
the
beginning,
is
there
any
other
nation
in
the
world
that
provides
for
civil
liability
for
human
rights
violations,
the
answer
is
no,
there
is
no
other
nation
in
the
world.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that's
correct.
but
for
human
rights
violations.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
none
other
than
the
ats,
your--
honor.
if
--
there--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--the
--
well,
there's
no
alien
diversity
jurisdiction.
so
--
because
an
alien
is
suing
an
alien.
and
there
is
a
good
argument
you
could
dispose
of
this
case,
but
not
all
the
other
ats
cases,
by
simply
holding
there's
no
alien
diversity
jurisdiction
here.
and
the
ats
can't
have
been
viewed
as
displacing
congress's
intent
to
limit
jurisdiction
at
the
time.
that
would
dispose
of
this
case,
and
other
cases
involving
foreign
corporations
sued
by
other
plaintiffs.
cases
likes
talisman
and
nestle
and
rio
tinto.
but
we
respectfully
urge
you
to
reach
a
broader
ruling,
which
is
that
corporate
liability
is
foreclosed
both
by
the
uniform
practice
--
the
uniform
practice,
not
just
adjudications
--
of
the
nations
of
the
world--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
we
do
not
urge
a
rule
of
corporate
impunity
here.
corporate
officers
are
liable
for
human
rights
violations
and
for
those
they
direct
among
their
employees.
there
can
also
be
suits
under
state
law
or
the
domestic
laws
of
nations,
but
there
may
not
be
ats
federal
common
law
causes
of
action
against
corporations.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
united
states.
it's
nigerian
plaintiffs
suing
an
english
and
dutch
company
for
activity
alleged
to
have
aided
and
abetted
the
nigerian
government
for
conduct
taking
place
entirely
within
nigeria.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
question,
shell
did
not
waive
personal
jurisdiction
objections
to
the
suit.
the
court
in
the
companion
wiwa
case
determined
--
rejected
the
personal
jurisdiction
affirmative
defense,
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
so
if
you
look
at
joint
appendix
pages
111
to
112,
you'll
see
that
we
absolutely
preserved
the
personal
jurisdiction
defense.
missing
from
the
discussion
you've
just
had
with
mr.
hoffman
about
possible
ways
to
minimize
the
dangers
of
applying
the
ats
in
foreign
countries
is
any
mention
of
congress.
and
i'd
like
to
return
us
to
the
question
presented
on
this
round
of
the
argument,
which
is:
should
the
ats
and,
justice
ginsburg,
federal
common
law
be
applied
to
conduct
taking
place
entirely
within
the
borders
of
a
foreign
country?
and
our
answer
is
it
should
not,
under
the--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--we
do
not
believe
that
you
need
to
address
filartiga
because
filartiga
is
taken
care
of
entirely
by
the
proper
body,
which
is
congress.
congress,
in
enacting
the
tvpa,
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
covered
a
situation
like
filartiga,
where
a
paraguayan
plaintiff
sues
a
paraguayan
individual
defendant
for
conduct
in
paraguay.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice
kennedy.
we
think
the
current
correct
result
is
that
the
ats
and
federal
common
law,
which
is
substantive
and
remedial
law
of
the
united
states
--
and
here,
we
agree
with
the
united
states
on
page
2
of
its
brief
--
ats
plus
federal
common
law
is
the
substantive
and
remedial
law
of
the
united
states.
and
we
think,
under
the
well-established
canon
against
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law,
absent
congressional
clear
indication,
there
should
not
be
such
an
extension.
therefore--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--we
--
we
don't
concede
that
the
statute
applies
on
the
high
seas.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
sosa
said,
looking
to
the
three
blackstone
paradigms,
assault
on
ambassadors,
interference
with
safe
conduct,
and
piracy,
that
certainly
the
antecedents
to
the
ats,
the
morbois
incident
of
an
attack
in
philadelphia,
and
the
new
york
constable
entering
the
home
in
new
york
city
of
the
dutch
ambassador,
those
were
incidents
on
u.s.
soil.
and
sosa
says
perhaps
also
the
third
paradigm,
piracy,
might
also
be
covered.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
at
the
time.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
our
clear
--
our
position
on
piracy
is
this.
even
if
you
think
the
ats
and
federal
common
law
can
extend
to
conduct
on
the
high
seas,
which
are
stateless,
a
place
where
no
foreign
sovereign
rules,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
ats
and
federal
common
law
can
apply
to
conduct
within
a
foreign
sovereign's
borders--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
with
respect,
the
united
states
has
not
acceded
to
the
principle
of
universal
civil
jurisdiction.
and
with
respect--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
breyer,
in
our
brief
at
48,
note
11,
you'll
see
that
that's
not
quite
the
case.
i'm
sorry
--
i'm
sorry.
we
object
--
the
united
states
objected
to
the
universal
civil
jurisdiction
aspect
of
the
convention
against
torture.
we
have
never
acceded
to
that.
and
the
reason
is
that
we
fear
exactly
the
consequences
justice
kennedy
began
the
argument
with.
we
fear
that
if
we
say
that
a
united
states
court
can
be
open
to
try
any
accused
law
of
nations
violator
anywhere
in
the
world
regardless
of
the
place
of
the
conduct,
the
other
nations
of
the
world
might
seek
to
do
the
same
to
us.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
criminal
is
very
different
from
civil.
and
what
we
--
the
precise
argument
we
are
making
here
is
that
the
presumption
against
application
of
u.s.
law
to
conduct
within
foreign
sovereigns
--
and
remember,
the
purpose
of
the
presumption,
justice
scalia,
is
to
avoid
conflict
with
foreign
sovereigns.
there
is
no
foreign
sovereign
over
the
high
seas.
the
conflict
arises,
and
the
presumption
protects
against
this
conflict,
when
we
go
into
a
foreign
nation,
we
project
our
law.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
if
you
wish
to
say
no
extraterritorial
application,
we
think
sosa
does
not
foreclose
that,
because
sosa
simply
said
piracy
might
be
one
of
the
actions
covered.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
key
point,
which
is--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no,
we
do
not,
your
honor,
because
we
many
think
that
in
rem
actions
were
the
typical
things
contemplated.
and
as
soon
as
united
states
v.
palmer
comes
along,
this
court
applied
the
presumption
against
extraterritorial
application
of
u.s.
law
to
--
the
application
of
the
then-extant
piracy
statute
to
a
foreign-flagged
vessel
on
the
high
seas.
the
thought
was,
don't
apply
it
to
the
foreign-flagged
vessel
because
that's
like
a
mini-foreign
country
on
the
high
seas.
so
we
would
argue
that
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
actually
applied
in
the
founding
era
even
to
piracy.
but
even
if
you
were
to
say,
well,
piracy
is
covered
now,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
norms
that
are
invoked
here
under
the
law
of
nations
can
be
subject
to
a
u.s.
civil
cause
of
action.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
our
point
is
that
the
u.s.
is
projecting
here
--
and
i
don't
believe
through
the
statute,
the
ats,
but
through
the
causes
of
action
under
federal
common
law
--
our
law
onto
foreign
countries.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
the
difference
it
makes
is
that
in
your
hypothetical,
the
reverse
marbois
case,
the
proper
remedy
would
have
been
to
seek
--
for
france
to
seek
extradition
of
the
u.s.
assailant
and--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--because
congress
hasn't
clearly
said
so.
and
the
point
of
the
presumption
is
to
avoid
all
of
the
judge-made
possible
qualifications
that
were
discussed
earlier:
exhaustion,
political
question,
the
possible
limitations
suggested
by
the
european
union.
congress
doesn't
get
to
say
anything
if
it's
the
courts
deciding,
through
their
own
prudence,
together
with
the
advice
from
the
department
of
state.
and,
justice
alito,
in
answer
to
your
question
whether--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they're
not
always
applied,
justice
scalia.
and
if
so,
it
sometimes
takes
many
years
before
they
happen.
and
the
state
department
is
not
always
listened
to.
in
the
south
african
apartheid
case,
not
only
did
the
state
department
seek
to
protest
the
action,
but
the
government
of
south
africa
filed
a
letter,
and
the
district
court
ignored
both.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
correct.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
french
had
several
remedies.
the
french
victim
could
have
sued
in
tort
in
the
united
states.
and
under
the
transitory
tort
doctrine
that
was
adopted
at
the
time,
which
is
not
a
precedent
for
the
ats,
would
have
allowed
a
suit
under
french
law.
french
law
would
have
been
imported
to
try
that
claim.
so
it
could
have
been
tried
in
state
court
as
an
assault.
second,
there
could
have
been
extradition.
third,
the
point
of
the
marbois
in
stimulating
the
ats
was
that
if
a
u.s.
citizen
attacks
the
french
ambassador
on
u.s.
soil,
and
we
then
harbored
him,
that
could
have
led
to
an
incident
of
war.
but
there
is
no
incident
of
war
or
conflict
posed
in
your
hypothetical
because
extradition
was
possible,
and
state
court
tort
violations
--
state
law
tort
--
state
court
jurisdiction
over
a
transitory
tort
should
have
obtained.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
sotomayor,
i
--
there
is
theoretically
the
possibility
that
if
state
law
transitory
tort
didn't
work,
and
if
extradition
didn't
work,
and
if
the
french
didn't
just
seek
to
punish
the
assailant
in
their
own
country,
maybe
there
would
have
been
international
conflict,
but
there
is
no
evidence
congress
was
thinking
about
that
at
the
time.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
it
did.
but,
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
single
founding
era
precedent,
not
a
single
one,
that
involves
the
reverse
hypothetical.
every
single
founding
era
precedent
that
simulated
the
ats
or
came
soon
in
its
aftermath
involved
international
law
violations
alleged
to
have
occurred
on
u.s.
soil
or
in
u.s.
waters.
the
two
cases
most
soon
after
the
ats
were
moxon
v.
the
fanny
and
bolchos
v.
darrell,
which
involved
supposed
law
of
nations
violations
on
u.s.
waters
and
on
u.s.
soil.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
alito,
we
would
respectfully
urge
that
direction
is
--
is
not
enough.
if
the
place
of
the
injury
and
the
place
of
the
last
conduct
was
on
foreign
soil.
we
think
ordinary
restatement
of
conflict
principles
would
suggest
that
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury,
not
to
the
forum
law.
and
the
most
important
point
about
the
ats
and
federal
common
law,
even
if
it
were
under
section
1331,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
it's
an
application
of
u.s.
substantive
and
remedial
law
to
another
country.
and
the
offense
is
we're
telling
the
other
country
that
they
have
to
entertain
private
civil
litigation.
and
there
is
a
difference,
justice
breyer,
between
criminal
and
civil--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--bradford
is
the
best
thing
the
petitioners
have
in
the
founding
era,
and
it's
not
enough
to
overcome
the
presumption--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--because
he
could
have
been
speaking
about
the
high
seas.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
and
he--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it
was
americans,
but
we
--
we
think,
if
properly
read,
the
hostilities
of
which
he
spoke
was
the
high
seas
part
of
the
conduct.
it
was
an
american
who
piloted
the
french
fleet
60
miles
from
the
iles
de
los
to
the
sierra
leone
river.
and
that
was
--
if
you
read
grammatically,
we
think
that
is
what
attorney
general
bradford
was
referring
to.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
many
--
many
differences
between
us
and
filartiga.
for
one,
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
class
action
against
a
corporation.
and
if
you
don't
agree
with
us
on
the
lack
of
extraterritorial
application,
we
still
maintain
that
the
ats
does
not
apply
to
corporations.
second,
there
is
--
there
was
a
--
there's
an
allegation
here
of
aiding
and
abetting
a
foreign
government.
it
was
unclear
in
filartiga
whether
the
paraguayan
was
acting
within
or
without
the
state's
authority,
but
--
and
he
was
later
deported,
so
we
don't
know
the
answer.
but
here
the
offense
is
magnified
because
the
allegation
is
that
an
english
and
a
dutch
company
aided
and
abetted
the
nigerian
government.
that
is
where
the
offense
to
the
principle
against
international
friction
is
at
its
highest.
and
so
if
you
weren't
to
adopt
our
position
in
full,
at
a
minimum
we
think
you
should
hold
that
the
presumption
applies
to
foreign
cubed
cases
involving
aiding
and
abetting
a
foreign
government,
where
everything
is
foreign.
but
we
don't
think
you
should
do
that
in
the
first
instance.
we
respectfully
submit
the
better
approach
is
to
apply
the
presumption
as
a
categorical
matter.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
we
think
there
is,
justice
kennedy.
and
we
think
the
principle
of
extraterritoriality
is
--
is
essentially
a
democracy-forcing
device
to
send
these
questions
back
to
congress.
and
if
we
send
it
back
to
congress--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--you
have--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--chief
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
making
it
up
themselves,
and
that's
why
there's
all
the
more
reason
to
apply
the
presumption
against
application
to
foreign
countries.
it's
far
worse
to
have
judges--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--we--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--we
are
not,
your
honor.
sosa
did
not
address
the
question
we
have
before
the
court
today.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
don't
need
to
overrule,
so
to
speak,
filartiga
on
justice
kennedy's
question.
you
can
simply
say
that
in
the
intervening
period,
congress
did,
as
is
appropriate
in
the
area
of
applying
law
to
foreign
conduct,
pass
a
specific
statute,
the
tvpa,
that
applies
exactly
to
the
conduct
in
filartiga.
that
should
inform
your
decision
today,
that
you
don't
need
judge-made
law
to
address
the
situation
in
filartiga.
and
you
don't
need
to
overrule
sosa,
with
respect,
justice
sotomayor,
because
sosa
did
not
address,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
extraterritoriality
argument
we
make
today.
it
went
off
at
the
first
step.
no
international
norms,
specifically
universal
and
specific
--
sufficiently
specific
and
universal.
so
it
didn't
get
to
the
concerns
about
friction
with
foreign
countries.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
if
--
the
fact
that
the
nations
of
the
world
agree
on
norms
does
not
mean
the
nations
of
the
world
agree
on
remedies.
and
what
the
ats
and
federal
common
law,
as
interpreted
in
sosa,
do
is
project
a
u.s.
civil
cause
of
action
with
u.s.
rules,
punitive
damages,
no
attorney
fee
shifting,
contingent
fee
and
punitive
damages.
that
should
not
be
done
except
by
congress.
they
did
it
in
the
tvpa,
but
you
should
not
permit
it
to
be
done
here.
thank
you.
