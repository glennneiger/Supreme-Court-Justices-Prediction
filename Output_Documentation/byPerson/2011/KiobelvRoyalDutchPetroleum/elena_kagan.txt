justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hoffman,
could
i--
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
kneedler,
when
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--excuse
me.
justice
elena
kagan
when
you
say
in
your
brief
that
we
should
look
at
this
as
a
remedial
question,
as
a
question
of
enforcement,
do
you
say
that
because
you're
thinking
of
this
as
a
vicarious
liability
case?
in
other
words,
there's
an
individual
person
who
clearly
has
violated
a
norm
of
international
law,
and
then
the
question
of
whether
to
hold
the
corporation
liable
is
an
enforcement
question;
or
would
you
say
that
it's
also
an
enforcement
question
when
we're
talking
about
direct
corporate
liability?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
this--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
mr.
kneedler,
in
sosa,
and
this
is
the
footnote
20,
we
said
that
the
question
of
whether
you
were
a
state
actor
or
not
a
state
actor
might
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
substantive
norm
that
applied
to
you.
and
i
guess
the
question
here
is
why
that
same
analysis
doesn't
apply
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
corporate
liability.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
substantive
norm
that
applied
to
corporations?
maybe
there
is,
maybe
there
isn't,
but
that
that's
the
question
as
opposed
to
what
you
suggest
in
your
brief,
that
really
we
should
just
think
of
this
as
a
question
of
enforcement
which
is
entirely
up
to
federal
common
law.
and
i
guess
the
question
is:
why
think
of
it
as
enforcement
rather
than
as
a
substantive
obligation?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i'm
not
saying
footnote
20--
justice
elena
kagan
--it
addressed
a
different
question,
but
it's
an
analogous
question.
if
the
question
of
whether
non-state
actors
are
part
of
the
substantive
obligation
question,
why,
too,
isn't
the
question
of
whether
international
law
extends
to
corporations?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
ms.
sullivan,
i
think
that
that's
mostly
because
all
of
these
are
written
to
prohibit
certain
acts,
and
they
don't
talk
about
the
actors.
so,
if
i
could,
you
know,
draw
an
analogy,
it's
as
if
somebody
came
and
said,
you
know,
this
--
this
norm
of
international
law
does
not
apply
to
norwegians.
and
you
--
well,
there's
no
case
about
norwegians.
and
it
doesn't
specifically
say
"norwegians".
but,
of
course,
it
applies
to
norwegians
because
it
prevents
everybody
from
committing
a
certain
kind
of
act.
justice
elena
kagan
miss
sullivan,
take
an
example
that
has
all
the
extraterritoriality
aspects
of
this
case
taken
away
from
it.
let's
assume
that
the
french
ambassador
is
assaulted
or
attacked
in
some
way
in
the
united
states,
and
that
that
attack
is
by
a
corporate
agent.
would
we
say
that
the
corporation
there
cannot
be
sued
under
the
alien
tort
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
could
you
explain
to
me
--
we
would
have
to
sue
the
person
individually?
justice
elena
kagan
what
--
so
this
goes
back
to--
justice
breyer's
question.
where
do
you
find
that
in
international
law?
where
--
where
does
it
say,
when
the
french
ambassador
is
sued
in
the
united
states
by
a
corporate
agent,
we
can't
sue
the
corporation?
justice
elena
kagan
you
don't
--
of
course
one
could
bring
an
ats
suit
against
the
individual.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
now,
all
united
states
law
and
mostly
in
other
countries'
law
would
hold
the
corporation
liable
for
the
individual's
act.
isn't
that
right?
that's
a
general
principle
of
law.
justice
elena
kagan
miss
sullivan
that
would
be
true
against
an
individual
as
well.
the
ats
is
just
a
unique
statute.
it's
unique
against
individuals,
and
it's
unique
against
corporations.
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
you're
here
to
address
which
is
whether
corporations
are
meaningfully
different
from
individuals.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
that's
--
if
that
is
true
--
let
me
just
take
you
back
to
this
question
of
separating
out
direct
corporate
liability
from
vicarious
corporate
liability.
because
it
is
clear
--
one
question
is,
is
there
a
substantive
international
law
obligation?
but
there
is
another
question
which
would
not
be
an
international
law
question,
which
is,
a
remedial
question.
remedies
are
addressed
by
common
law
rather
than
--
american
common
law
rather
than
by
international
law.
so
why
shouldn't
we
look
at
the
vicarious
liability
question
as
essentially
a
question
about
the
scope
of
the
appropriate
remedy
once
an
international
law
violation
has
been
found?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
question
of
who
can
sued
is
a
remedial
question.
justice
elena
kagan
the
question
of
who
has
an
obligation
is
a
substantive
question.
justice
elena
kagan
to
give
you
an
example,
the
tort
in
violation
of
the
law
nations
has
been
committed.
it
has
been
committed
by
the
corporate
agent.
and
the
question
then
is,
can
one
hold
the
corporation
responsible
for
that
tort.
and
that
seems
to
be
a
question
of
enforcement,
of
remedy;
not
of
substantive
international
law.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sullivan,
could
i
take
you
back--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
the
tvpa
is
one
limited
statute
dealing
with
one
particular
category
of
offense,
and
it
was
specifically
meant
to
supplement,
not
to
supplant,
the
ats.
so
between
those
two
things,
the
fact
that
it's
limited
to
torture,
and
that
there
was
no
design
to
supplant
the
ats,
i
guess
i
think
that
if
your
best
shot
is
the
tvpa,
that's
a
--
that's
a
weak
one.
justice
elena
kagan
miss
sullivan,
if
i
asked
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--you
--
you
said
the
international
community
draws
this
line.
and
as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
international
sources
are
simply
silent
as
to
this
question.
so
if
i
said
to
you,
miss
sullivan,
i
want
to
go
back
and
read
the
best
thing
you
have
saying
that
the
international
law
sources
draw
this
line,
what
do
i
read?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
rome
statute
is
different,
because
the
rome
statute
is
about
criminal
liability.
and
we
know
that
the
rome
statute
was
meant
to
complement
many
international
states'
laws
which
in
fact
do
not
hold
corporations
criminally
liable
domestically.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
that's
for
individuals
as
well
as
for
corporations--
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
would
agree,
mr.
hoffman,
that
if
there
were
an
exhaustion
requirement,
it
would
not
apply
only
to
nigeria,
but
also
to
the
netherlands
and
to
the
u.k.--
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
sullivan,
your
argument
is
very
broad,
and
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
your
case
might
properly
be
dismissed.
but
take
a
different
case,
and
it's
a
--
just
a
variation
on
the
marbois
incident,
where
instead
of
being
attacked
in
philadelphia,
the
french
ambassador
to
britain
is
attacked
in
london,
but
is
attacked
by
a
united
states
citizen,
who
then
comes
home
to
the
united
states,
seeks
refuge
in
the
united
states.
and
the
french
ambassador
--
the
french
ambassador
wants
to
bring
an
action.
wouldn't
the
ats
have
contemplated
exactly
that
sort
of
action?
i
mean,
why
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
attack
on
the
french
ambassador
by
a
united
states
citizen
occurred
in
philadelphia
or
occurred
in
london?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
i'm
advised
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
that
there
were
very
few
extradition
treaties
at
that
time.
and
even
if
extradition
was
a
possible
remedy,
i
mean
why
shouldn't
we
understand
the
ats
to
provide
supplemental
remedies
as
well,
civil
as
well
as
criminal,
civil
as
well
as
extradition?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
we
should
fix
that
then.
but
that's
not
the
question
here,
right?
the
question
here
is
--
is
the
different
one
of
whether
you
ever
get
to
the
exhaustion
question.
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
reverse
marbois,
you
said
congress
didn't
speak,
but
i
think
what
we
said
in
sosa
is
that
congress
did
speak,
that
congress
was
referring
to
exactly
that
kind
of
tort
when
it
passed
the
alien
tort
statute.
and
you
are
saying
it
would
have
made
a
difference
to
congress
that
the
incident
occurred
in
a
different
place
even
though
the
attacker
was
a
united
states
citizen
seeking
refuge
in
the
united
states
and
leaving
the
french
with
no
remedy.
justice
elena
kagan
but--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
ms.
sullivan,
i'm
going
to
read
you
something
from
sosa,
which
--
it
talks
all
about
the
rule
that
it
adopts
and
then
it
says:
"this
is
generally
consistent
with
the
reasoning
of
many
of
the
courts
and
judges
who
faced
the
issue
before
it
reached
this
court.
"
"see
filartiga.
"
and
then
it
quotes
filartiga:
"for
purposes
of
civil
liability,
the
torturer
has
become
like
the
pirate
and
slave
trader
before
him,
an
enemy
of
all
mankind.
"
so
we
gave
a
stamp
of
approval
to
filartiga
and
filartiga's
understanding
that
there
were
certain
categories
of
offenders
who
were
today's
pirates.
justice
elena
kagan
and
isn't
that
really
the
way
to
reconcile
the
dutch
positions?
the
dutch
are
objecting
because
they
think
they
have
a
fair
forum,
but
when
the
judges
were
faced
with
a
case
arising
from
libya,
they
thought
that
there
was
no
fair
forum
there.
and
that's
the
difference,
that
in
one
case
there
was
exhaustion
and
in
the
other
there
wasn't.
justice
elena
kagan
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
case
no.
10-1491,
kiobel
and
others
versus
royal
dutch
petroleum
company
and
others.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
from
ogoniland
located
in
the
niger
delta
area
of
nigeria.
the
defendants
are
dutch,
english
and
nigerian
oil
companies
that
engaged
in
oil
exploration
in
ogoniland.
the
plaintiffs
protested
those
activities
because
of
their
adverse
environmental
effects.
they
alleged
that
the
companies
then
enlisted
the
nigerian
government
to
suppress
those
protest
that,
as
a
result,
members
of
the
nigerian
army
and
police
forces
violently
attacked,
beat
and
murdered
ogoni
villagers.
the
plaintiffs
were
eventually
granted
political
asylum
in
the
united
states
and
they
sued
the
companies
in
federal
court
for
atrocities
relating
to
the
events
in
ogoniland.
the
question
is
whether
the
us
courts
can
hear
a
case
such
as
this
brought
by
foreign
plaintiffs
against
foreign
defendants
over
events
that
occurred
on
foreign
soil.
the
plaintiffs
say
they
can
bring
their
suit
under
one
of
the
oldest
laws
on
the
books,
the
alien
tort
statute
or
ats.
it
was
passed
in
1789
during
the
very
first
session
of
congress.
it
is
one
sentence
long
and
provides
“the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
by
an
alien
for
a
tort
only
committed
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
or
treaty
of
the
united
states.”
the
issue
is
whether
that
statute
applies
to
conduct
that
occurred
entirely
outside
the
united
states.
now,
when
congress
passes
a
statute,
we
normally
assume
that
the
statute
governs
only
conduct
here
in
the
united
states,
not
conduct
in
other
countries.
the
reason
is
simple.
first,
it's
just
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
when
congress
passes
a
law,
it
is
passing
a
law
that
applies
in
the
united
states
and
not
some
other
country
unless
the
law
tells
us
otherwise.
second,
regulating
conduct
abroad
risks
serious
foreign
policy
consequences
and
courts
are
and
should
be
reluctant
to
invite
such
consequences
unless
that
is
what
congress
clearly
intended.
now,
we
see
no
reason
to
treat
the
ats
any
differently.
like
any
other
statute,
we
assumed
that
it
applies
only
to
conduct
here
at
home
unless
we
determine
that
congress
intended
for
it
to
reach
conduct
abroad.
and
the
text
of
the
ats,
that
one
sentence,
provides
no
indication
of
such
reach,
the
mere
fact
that
the
statute
mentions
aliens
or
the
law
of
nation
is
not
enough.
violations
of
the
law
of
nations
affecting
aliens
do
not
necessarily
occur
abroad,
they
can
happen
right
here
at
home.
in
fact,
there
were
two
notorious
episodes
just
before
passage
of
the
ats
that
show
just
that.
in
one,
in
1784,
a
french
adventurer
assaulted
a
french
diplomat
in
philadelphia.
the
french
filed
a
formal
protest
with
the
continental
congress
and
threatened
to
leave
united
states.
the
potential
lack
of
a
judicial
remedy
for
the
diplomat
precipitated
a
serious
crisis.
in
the
other
episode,
in
1787,
a
new
york
constable
rated
the
dutch
ambassador's
home
in
new
york
and
arrested
one
of
his
servants.
the
constable
was
arrested
intern
but
secretary
of
foreign
affairs,
john
jay,
told
the
dutch
not
to
expect
much
because
there
was
no
law
on
the
books
that
would
allow
a
lawsuit
for
such
a
violation.
that
changed
when
the
ats
was
passed
two
years
later.
this
contemporaneous
examples
fall
within
the
precise
terms
of
the
ats
but
do
not
involve
any
conduct
occurring
abroad.
justice
story
wrote
in
1822
that
no
nation
has
ever
yet
pretended
to
be
the
custos
morum
of
the
whole
world,
the
guardian
of
morals
of
the
whole
world.
it
is
implausible
to
suppose
that
the
very
first
congress
wanted
their
fledgling
republic,
still
struggling
to
gain
international
recognition,
to
be
the
first
such
country
and
to
open
their
new
courts
to
suits
by
foreign
plaintiffs
against
foreign
defendants
for
wrongs
occurring
entirely
on
foreign
soil.
now,
in
modern
times,
when
lower
courts
have
undertaken
to
apply
the
ats
to
such
conduct
abroad,
affected
foreign
countries
have
vigorously
protested
what
they
have
viewed
as
an
infringement
by
the
united
states
under
sovereignty,
country
such
as
canada,
germany,
indonesia,
south
africa,
switzerland
and
the
united
kingdom.
and
keep
in
mind
that
if
we
say
we
can
entertain
suits
by
foreign
plaintiffs
against
foreign
defendants
for
conduct
on
foreign
soil,
there
is
no
reason
another
country
might
not
do
the
same
to
us
that
is,
assert
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
case
by
a
us
citizen
against
another
us
citizen
for
events
occurring
in
the
united
states.
now,
for
all
these
reasons
and
others
set
forth
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
plaintiffs
cannot
proceed
with
this
suit.
all
members
of
the
court
agree
with
that
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor
and
kagan
have
joined.
