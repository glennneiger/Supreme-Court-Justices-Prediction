mr.
hoffman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
hoffman,
i
--
i
thought
that
justice
kennedy
asked
you,
is
there
another
nation
that
has
a
counterpart
to
1350
that
imposes
civil
liability
on
corporations
for
violations
of
customary
international
law,
whether
the
conduct
occurred
abroad,
the
harmed
person
is
employed,
and
the
defendant
is
not
a
u.s.
resident?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
sounds
very
much
like
filartiga.
and
i
thought
that
--
that
sosa
accepted
that
filartiga
would
be
a
viable
action
under
the
tort
claims
act.
so,
i
thought
what
we
were
talking
about
today,
the
question
was
is
it
only
individual
defendants
or
are
corporate
defendants
also
liable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
statute
doesn't
use
the
word
"individual",
and
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"person".
as
far
as
a
corporate
entity
is
concerned,
a
corporate
--
a
corporation
could
sue,
could
be
a
plaintiff
under
the
alien
tort
statute,
could
it
not?
there's
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
happened
to
i.g.
farben?
i
thought
it
was
dissolved
and
its
assets
taken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
no
--
there
was
no
civil
liability
adjudicated
in
nuremberg.
it
was
about
criminal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
corporation
is
headquartered,
well,
suppose
that
has
a
typical
respondeat
superior
liability
says
corporations
are
liable
for
the
acts
of
their
agents.
so
--
and
most
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
i
think
most
countries
in
the
world
have
such
a
notion
that
corporate
--
corporations
are
responsible
for
the
acts
of
their
agents.
so
how
does
that
--
looking
to
the
law
where
the
corporation
is
headquartered,
where
does
that
get
you
when
that
country
has
the
very
same
law
that
we
do,
that
yes,
corporations
are
liable
for
the
acts
of
their
agents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
sullivan,
i'm
--
in
sosa
as
i
understand
it,
it's
all
about
what
is
the
conduct
that
falls
under
this
law
of
nations.
it
is
not
about
who
is
the
actor
subject
to
that
law.
sosa
is
dealing
with
what
kinds
of
conduct
come
within
the
alien
tort
statute.
it
--
it
doesn't
consider
the
question
of
what
actor;
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
what
was
before
the
court
is
what
kind
of
activity
violates,
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
nations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
has
taken
that
into
account.
you
are
just
representing
the
corporations
to
say
what
is
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
when
the
united
states
representative
told
us
they
think
that
individuals
and
corporations
are
both
subject
to
suit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
re
--
rejected
civil
liability
for
everyone.
it
wasn't
limited
to
corporations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
--
may
i
ask
you
about
the
statement
you
just
made?
personal
jurisdiction
was
raised
as
a
defense,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
your
position
is
it
was
waived?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
not
adjudicated.
is
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
didn't
mention
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
might
be
--
nigeria
is
one
question,
but
other
potential
forums
are
the
u.k.
and
the
netherlands.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
--
haven't
both
of
those
nations
said
they
would
not
entertain
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
happened
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
overturned
it
which
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
rejected
the
forum
non
conveniens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
reliance
on
the
alien
tort
statute,
that
if
your
theory
is
that
this
is
a
violation
of
a
universal
norm,
and
that
federal
common
law
makes
it
a
claim
available
in
the
united
states,
now
there
is
1331
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
couldn't
you
have
said,
never
mind
the
alien
tort
statute,
i'm
suing
under
1331
federal
question
jurisdiction,
and
i
have
got
--
the
claim
for
relief
is
the
u.s.
common
law
implementing
the
international
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
they
had--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--maybe
they
had
to
provide
that
in
1789
because
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
existing
at
the
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
point
out,
i
think,
an
anomaly.
if
the
victim
is
a
united
states
citizen
--
you
say
the
only
ties
here
are
that
the
victims
got
asylum
in
the
united
states,
so
they
are
here.
but
someone
who
is
here
all
the
time,
someone
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
is
abroad
and
is
a
victim
of
one
of
these
atrocities,
there
would
be
no
suit
for
such
a
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
under
the
alien
tort
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean,
ms.
sullivan,
that
you
--
and
do
i
understand
your
argument
on
brief
correctly,
that
you
would
say
from
--
the
revival
of
1350
from
filartiga
was
wrong
because
nothing
happened
--
nothing
happened
in
the
united
states
there?
marcos
was
wrong
because
nothing
--
the
wrong
occurred
abroad?
does
your
--
the
argument
you're
making
now
that
this
is
not
applicable
to
things
that
happened
offshore
exclude
filartiga
and
marcos?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you're
at
least
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
sullivan,
before
your
time
runs
out,
i
mean,
you
have
said,
candidly,
that
if
filartiga
were
to
come
up
today,
if
marcos
were
to
come
up
to
this
forum,
there
would
be
no
basis
under
the
alien
tort
statute.
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
those
two
cases
--
that
we
accept
them
--
sosa
seemed
to
accept
them.
is
there
anything
different
about
your
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
in
your
--
you
do
say
in
your
brief
that
you
think
that
filartiga
is
within
the
alien
tort
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
--
don't
adopt
a
theory
that
many
of
the
--
the
briefs
do,
that
there
has
to
be
some
connection,
some
nexus
to
the
united
states.
you
just
tell
us
that
filartiga
is
okay.
and
how
about
marcos,
is
that
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
--
you
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
don't
offer
us
a
nexus.
you
don't
offer
us
that
reason
why
filartiga
was
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else?
you
--
you
say
filartiga.
you
don't
mention
marcos.
is
marcos
in
your
view
a
proper
exercise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
also
a
u.s.
perpetrator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
given
the
court's
recent
decisions
on
personal
jurisdiction,
and
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
goodyear
tire
case,
is
there
personal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
or
in
the
case
of
your
hypothetical?
