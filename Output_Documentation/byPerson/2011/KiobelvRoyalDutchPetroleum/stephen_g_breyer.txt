justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
to
--
are
you
finished
with
that
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
some
clarification
on
the
first
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked.
well
--
i'll
get
it
in
reading
about
it.
you
go
ahead.
you
want
to
reserve
your
time.
i
can
find
the
answer
to
what
i
was
going
to
ask.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so,
why
--
why
then
--
you
want
to
answer
in
your
brief
--
and
this--
question,
i
find
impossibly
difficult,
maybe
highly
fact-dependent.
there
is
no
united
states
supreme
court
of
the
world.
there
is
no
way
of
getting
unified
law
on
the
points
of
whether
when
we
interpret
a
common
law
federal
--
a
system
of
federal
common
law
to
decide
whether
a
corporation
can
be
defendant
--
a
defendant
in
a
certain
kind
of
case.
every
other
country
could
do
the
same.
and
there's
no
way
of
resolving
it.
all
right?
so,
i
find
that
a
difficult
question.
i
don't
know
why
that's
in
this
case.
i
would
have
thought
the
question
in
this
case
is,
can
a
private
actor
be
sued
for
certain
violations
of
--
of
substantive
criminal
law?
the
answer's
"yes".
okay?
genocide,
for
example.
and
then
the
question
is
--
a
corporation
is
a
private
actor.
and
is
there
any
reason
why,
just
like
any
other
private
actor,
a
corporation
couldn't
be
sued
for
genocide?
and
there
the
answer
is
i
don't
know,
but
i'll
find
out
when
the
other
side
argues.
you
see?
[laughter]
so,
i
--
i
think
this
is
unnecessarily
complicated.
they
made
a
--
a
categorical
rule.
they
said
never
sue
a
corporation.
i
seem
to
think
possibly
of
counterexamples.
pirates,
incorporated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know?
i
mean
--
so
--
so,
why
isn't
that
--
why
are
we
going
into
--
i
mean,
you
have
good
reason
for
doing
it,
and
i
want
to
hear
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
there
is
not
a
case.
that's
a
different
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
a
different
matter
because
you
can
have
a
principle
that
applies
even
though
there
isn't
a
case.
and
the
principle
that
here
would
apply
is
what
i
said,
pirates,
incorporated.
do
you
think
in
the
18th
century
if
they'd
brought
pirates,
incorporated,
and
we
get
all
their
gold,
and
blackbeard
gets
up
and
he
says,
oh,
it
isn't
me;
it's
the
corporation
--
do
you
think
that
they
would
have
then
said:
oh,
i
see,
it's
a
corporation.
good-bye.
go
home.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
what
source
have
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
source
have
you
for
that
proposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
couldn't
seize
another
person
other
than
blackbeard.
that's
why
--
if
the
ship
is
owned
by
a
corporation,
and
they
sue
the
corporation
in
18
--
17
whatever
it
was
--
'96
or
something,
what
reason
do
we
have
to
think
that
the
corporation
would
have
lost
--
i
mean,
would
have
won?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you
are
right
on
that
point.
what
about
slavery?
genocide
--
i
see
your
point
in
the
goldsmith
brief.
but
what
about
slavery?
that
seems
like
contrary
to
international
law
norms,
basic
law
norms,
it
could
be
committed
by
an
individual.
and
why,
if
it
could
be
committed
by
an
individual,
could
it
not
also
be
committed
by
a
corporation
in
violation
of
an
international
norm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
have
read
the
reason
why,
as
you
point
out
in
your
briefs,
the
corporations
are
different
in
many
countries
as
if
they
are
not
moral
persons.
and
i
have
in
my
mind
filled
in
the
blanks
on
that,
and
i
think
i
know
what
it
refers
to.
all
right.
that's
the
rationale
that
kept
them
out
of
some
of
these
treaties.
and
now
the
question
would
be,
all
right,
are
they
always
kept
out
no
matter
what?
and
i'm
bringing
up
the
two
counterexamples
i
think
were
fairly
strong,
was
pirates
inc.
but
that's
a
joke
example.
and
the
other
--
although
it's
a
point.
and
the
other
is
slavery.
what
about,
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
--
you
could
--
first,
maybe
you
addressed
this
case.
there
was
a
case
called
skinner
v.
east
india
company.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
all
right.
now
--
what
i'm
thinking
of,
is
if
you
go
through
the
rationale,
as
you
find
some
instances
where
individuals
could
in
fact
violate
an
international
law
norm,
and
then
you
find
a
lack
of
a
reason
why
a
corporation
couldn't
do
the
same.
now
in
that
kind
of
category,
could
the
court
say
we're
interpreting
federal
common
law
here
to
determine
who
can
be
sued
under
this
statute?
that's
the
remedial
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
a
--
in
certain
circumstances
there
could
be
a
suit
against
your
corporation.
you
would
have
to
be
careful,
because
you
recognize
that
by
creating
a
--
a
suit
against
your
corporation
you
are
saying
every
country
in
the
world
could
do
the
same.
and
--
and
therefore,
but
maybe
there
are
instances
of
like,
universal
jurisdiction
recognized
under
international
law,
where
you
could
be
pretty
certain
no
harm
would
be
done
by
that.
and
so
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
--
is
a
way
of
enforcing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
we
know
the
way
to
do
it.
i
mean,
in
skinner,
even
if
it
was
english
common
law,
the
court
reasons
--
it
says
the
taking
of
the
ship
on
the
high
seas
was
"odious
and
punishable
by
all
laws
of
god
and
man.
"
so
we
--
could
you
not
say,
where
an
action
is
forbidden
by
the
international
law,
and
it
is
punishable
or
--
by
all
laws
of
god
and
man,
in
such
a
circumstance
there
being
no
reason
to
deny
corporate
liability
here,
even
under
the
moral
person
rule,
it
--
we
interpret
the
federal
common
law
to
permit
that
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
you're
now
beginning
one
additional
thing,
that
the
corporate
rule
that
you're
about
to
cite
shows
that
many
people
believe
there
shouldn't
be
a
remedy
against
a
corporation
because
they're
not
moral
persons.
why
does
it
show
that
the
corporation
couldn't
violate
the
substantive
rule?
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
couldn't
you
just
say
if
--
would
we
have
the
power
to
say,
looking
at
sosa
and
the
principles
that
narrow
considerably
the
subject
matter
of
this
statute,
to
add
a
requirement
that
if
the
state
department
says
that
it
interferes
with
foreign
relations
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
statute,
can't
bring
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
get
rid
of
this
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
the
same
thing.
by
the
way,
did
we
sign
the
torture
treaty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we've
signed
the
torture
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
torture
treaty
does
provide
for
--
for
what
is
it
called,
universal
jurisdiction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
if
in
fact
a
corporation
in
the
united
states,
in
cahoots
with
the
government
or
something,
should
do
the
unusual
thing
of
violating
the
torture
treaty,
tasmania
or
any
country
in
the
world
that
signed
the
torture
treaty
would
have
jurisdiction
under
that
treaty
to
proceed,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
situation
that
we're
talking
about
already
is
in
existence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
--
no,
the
torture
treaty
says
nothing
about
corporations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
doesn't
mean
that,
but
if
the
--
what
is
the
question
we're
asking.
if,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
it
applied
to
pirates,
the
question
to
me
is
who
are
today's
pirates.
and
if
hitler
isn't
a
pirate,
who
is?
and
if,
in
fact,
an
equivalent
torturer
or
dictator
who
wants
to
destroy
an
entire
race
in
his
own
country
is
not
the
equivalent
of
today's
pirate,
who
is?
and
we
have
treaties
that
say
there
is
universal
jurisdiction.
other
countries
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
took
it
in
filartiga.
we
took
it
in
the
cases
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned.
so
i
absolutely
grant
you
could
make
the
distinction,
but,
given
the
purpose
and
an
objective
of
the
statute,
why
should
we
make
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we
did
explicitly
in
the
torture
treaty
in
respect
to
that
particular
incident.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do
that,
don't
they,
with
torture?
i
mean,
isn't
that
--
it's
criminal,
not
civil,
quite
right.
does
that
make
it
better?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
you're
right
about
that.
what
about
the
bradford?
isn't
there
--
all
this
stuff
about
--
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
could
have,
but
if
you
read
it,
it
looks
as
if
there
was
--
what
he's
upset
about
--
or
what
britain
was
upset
about
was
an
american.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
in
filartiga
it
was
done
through
a
corporation
--
the
torture
--
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
torture
is
done
by
hiring
torture,
inc.
okay?
is
there
or
isn't
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
heard
the
question.
i
need
an
answer
to
that
specific
--
that
specific
hypothetical.
everything
is
the
same
except
the
torture
is
carried
out
by
torture
inc.
because
my
actual
question
is
about
aiding
and
abetting.
i
mean,
the
first
part
is
they
do
it
directly.
can
they
bring
filartiga
or
not
--
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
if
it's
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
it
turns
on
that.
and
what
i
really
want
to
know
is
what
is
the
difference
between
that?
is
it
like
the
criminal
law
difference
of
accessory
versus
principle
or
what?
