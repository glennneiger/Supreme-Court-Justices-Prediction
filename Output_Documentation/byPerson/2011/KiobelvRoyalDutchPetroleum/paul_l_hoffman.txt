mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
received
asylum
in
the
united
states
because
of
the
human
rights
violations
alleged
in
the
complaint.
they
sued
the
defendants
for
their
role
in
these
human
rights
violations
in
u.s.
courts
because
the
defendants
are
here
and
subject
to
the
general
personal
jurisdiction
of
our
courts.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
suing
a
tortfeasor
in
our--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--personal
jurisdiction
was
raised
as
an
affirmative
defense,
but
not
raised
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
it
was
not
adjudicated
in
this
case.
our
position,
it
was
waived
when
it
was
not
raised
in
a
rule
12
motion.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
the
--
the
only
connection
between
the
events
in
nigeria
and
the
united
states
is
that
the
plaintiffs
are
now
living
in
the
united
states
and
have
asylum
because
of
those
events,
and
the
defendants
are
here.
there's
no
other
connection
between
the
events
that
took
place
in
the
--
in
nigeria
and
the
forum.
the
--
the
basis
for
suing
the
defendants
here
was
because
they
are
here
and
because
it
was
possible
to
get
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
it
is
--
it
is
possible
that
other
countries
would
assert
jurisdiction.
i
think
that,
generally
speaking
--
and
it
might
well
have
been
the
case
in
this
case
had
the
issues
been
raised
--
most
of
the
time,
alternative
doctrines
like
the
requirement
of
personal
jurisdiction,
or
the
requirement
--
or
forum
non
conveniens
or
other
doctrines
would
--
would
have
those
cases
litigated
in
other
places.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
events
were
and
what
the
claims
were
and
--
and
what
the
law
in
that
jurisdiction
was.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think
that
this
--
sorry.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
okay.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yeah.
well,
i
think
that
if
--
if,
in
fact,
the
u.s.
corporation
committed
a
violation
of
the
universal
jurisdiction
norm,
for
example,
as
we
believe
these
norms
are
in
this
case,
there
are
many
jurisdictions
in
which
u.s.
corporations
could
be
--
could
be
sued.
in
fact,
in
the
united
kingdom
and
the
netherlands,
i
believe
their
--
their
provisions
enforcing
the
international
criminal
court
might--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it
--
it
is
possible
that
the
plaintiffs
could
have
sued
in
other
places.
they
sued
here
because
this
is
where
they
live.
this
is
their
adopted
homeland
because
of
that.
the
united
states,
under
international
law,
clearly
has
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
claims
between
parties
properly
before
them.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
if
--
if
there
are
proceedings
with
respect
to
those
norms
or
violations,
yes,
they
do.
and
then
in
domestic
courts,
there
are
international
tribunals
that
have
a
limited
jurisdiction,
and
they
decide.
there
are
some
ad
hoc
tribunals
that
decide
other
cases.
and
the
national
--
national
courts
have
always
been
engines
of
decision
making
on
--
on
international
law.
in
fact,
that's
the
foundation
of
this
--
of
this
statute
comes
from
the
founders'
desire
to
have
federal
courts
decide
what
law
of
nations
claims--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it's
unlikely
that
--
that
that
would
come
up,
because
the
suit
could
be
brought
in
the
united
states.
it's
also
unlikely,
because,
based
on
most
forum
non
conveniens
doctrines,
the
suit
would
be
heard
here,
because--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
there
is
the
possibility
of
exhaustion
of
local
remedies.
i
know
the
european
union
brief
suggests
that
that's
part
of
the
international
law
package
that
one
has
to
accept.
and
this
court
in
sosa
did
say
that
it
would
consider
an
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
doctrine
if
that
was
the
case.
and,
of
course,
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
would
be
an
additional
safeguard
against
the
issue
that
justice
kennedy
and
justice--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
there--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
no,
not
at
all.
i
mean,
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
the
political
question
doctrine
would
clearly
apply,
and
--
and
--
and
a
court
would
decide
whether
to
go
forward.
if
the
united
states
believed
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
as
i
understand
the
u.s.
position
in
past
cases
like
doe
v.
exxon,
is
that
there
should
be
interlocutory
appeal
from
--
from
a
denial
of
a
political
question
doctrine
decision
to
go
forward
in
light
of
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
i
think
what
the
u.s.
position
is,
and
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
--
i
assume
it
would
be
accepted
--
is
that
if
the
united
states
says
going
forward
at
all
raises
those
questions,
that
it
would
be
able
to
go
up
on
a
cohen
v.--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it
could
be.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
in
corrie
v.
caterpillar,
for
example,
there
were
alleged
human
rights
violations,
and
the
united
states
said
that
because
u.s.
aid
was
involved
in
providing
the
bulldozers
that
were
involved
in
that
alleged
human
rights
violation,
that
the
court
should
dismiss
on
political
question
grounds,
and
the
courts
did
dismiss
on
political
question
grounds.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
that
would
get
rid
of
the
problem.
i
think
that
in
truth,
the
way
the
political
question
doctrine
would
work
would
probably
end
up
being
the
same
when
it's
that
kind
of
rule.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
we've
ratified--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--we've
ratified--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that's
right.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
that
the
court
would
do
in
this
case
that
would
change--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--right.
i
mean,
that's
different
from
the
icc.
but
the
--
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
don't
think
there
is
a
lot
wrong
with
the
rule,
actually.
in
a
foreign
cube
kind
of
case,
it
seems
to
me
the
eu
position
is,
number
one,
that
there
is
universal
jurisdiction
no
matter
whether
you
consider
the
federal
commonwealth
cause
of
action
prescriptive
or
not.
and
so,
the
countries
of
the
world
have
agreed
that
all
states
have
an
interest
in
enforcing
these
fundamental
norms
and
that's
part
of
international
law.
and
that
--
that
what
goes
with
that
are
limits
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
under
international
law,
which
safeguards
the
interests
of
third
states
before
the
united
states
can
litigate
it.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
that
we
would
--
we
would
--
there's
no
record,
obviously,
about
that.
and
one
of
the
arguments
we
would
make
about
exhaustion,
i
believe,
is
that
it
would
have
been
futile
to
exhaust
under
international
law
--
under
international
law
standards.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
and
i
think
that
we
--
you
know,
we
have
--
if
there
was
an
exhaustion
of
local
remedies
requirement,
then
we
would
have
to
see
if
we
could
satisfy
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
it's
not
clear.
i
mean,
in
fact,
the
--
you
know,
there
is
a
recent
dutch
decision
that
goes
perhaps
farther
than
the
alien
tort
statute,
the
al
brujaj
case.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
mean,
it
depends
on
how
the
court
frames
it.
i
mean,
there's
the
exhaustion
requirement
under
the
torture
victim
protection
act,
there
are
arguments
about
what
that
looks
like
under
international
law.
i
mean,
i
think
that
--
to
follow
up
on
justice
sotomayor's
point,
i
think
that
if
that's
deemed
by
the
court
to
be
a
requirement
of
international
law,
then
international
law
rules
on
exhaustion
should
apply,
and
we
would
either
be
able
to
satisfy
them
or
not
or
take
whatever
position
we
would
take
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
yeah.
no,
i
don't
think
that
anybody
disputes
that
the
legal
systems
in
the
netherlands
or
the
united
kingdom
are
fair.
i
mean,
they
obviously
are.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it
--
it
--
from
our
standpoint
it's
here,
the
way
i
started
the
argument,
really,
which
is
that
our
clients
are
here,
they're
here.
personal
jurisdiction
has
not
been
contested
and
no
one
made
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion
in
this
particular
case.
now,
there
was
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion
in
a
companion
case.
so
--
but
i
think
that
that's
a
problem
that
goes
more
toward--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--it
--
the
second
circuit
overturned
the
district
court
on
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
it
said
that
the
case
--
that
the
wiwa
case
could
proceed
and--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--rejected
forum
non
conveniens
in
that
case.
and
i
know
that
the
united
states
brief
believes
that
that
was
wrongly
decided.
but
from
our
standpoint,
if
we're
talking
about
the
way
that
the
ats
should
be
structured,
our
belief
is
that
forum
non
conveniens,
generally
speaking,
is
going
to
deal
with
the
problem
--
the
problems
that
the
court
has
raised.
if
--
if
the
court
believes
that
the
wiwa
decision
was
wrong
or
that
that
doctrine's
wrong,
that
doctrine
should
be
changed.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
this
court
in
sosa
said
that
its
analysis
did
not
necessarily
apply
to
1331,
and
i
think
that's
because
of
the
history
of
1350.
the
history
of
1350,
as
the
historians'
brief
lays
out,
is
that
the
founders
believed
that
certain
law
of
nations
norms
could
be
implemented
by
common
law
tort
actions.
and
this
court
in
sosa
found
that
without
further
congressional
action,
the
courts
of
the
united
states
would
be
available
to
enforce
norms
that
were
similar
to
those
norms.
and
in
fact,
the
norms
that
the
founders
were
familiar
with
were
very
similar
in
kind
to
the
universal
jurisdiction
norms
that
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--but
there
were
--
there
was
certain
--
there
were
certain
norms
that
were
believed
to
be
part
of
the
law
of
nations,
including
piracy
and
attacks
on
ambassadors,
and
they
were
governed
by
universal
standards.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
i
think
this
court
found
in
sosa
that
that
--
that
that
part
of
common
law
at
the
time
has
become
customary
international
law,
and
that
the
courts
of
this
country
have
not
lost
their
ability
to
enforce
the
same
kinds
of
law
of
nations
norms
as
the
founders
wanted
to
enforce
in
the
alien
tort
statute
in
the
context
of
universal
human
rights
norms.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think
this
court
said
that
the
federal
common
law
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
erie
--
i
think
this
court,
right
after
erie,
found
that
there
were
enclaves
of
federal
law,
one
of
them
being
the
area
of
foreign
relations,
where
federal
common
law
should
be
viewed
as
federal--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--we
don't.
we
don't,
and
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
in
sosa
and
in
the
alien
tort
statute
the
statute
itself
speaks
about
torts.
this
court
found,
based
on
the
history
and
intent
of
the
congress,
that
there
was
no
reason
to
wait
for
any
congressional
authorization
to
go
forward
on
those
claims,
and
therefore
it
was
available
to
bring
claims.
so--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--we're
not
taking
the
position
that
1331--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it
could
be,
but
what
seems
more
obvious
about
the
reason
for
the
alien
tort
statute
was
to
make
sure
that
there
was
a
federal
court
available
to
litigate
law
of
nations
claims
that
could
have
been
litigated
in
state
court,
just
as
these
claims
could
be
litigated
in
state
court.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
--
and,
also,
in
answer
to
the
respondents'
claims
about
extraterritoriality,
if
one
imagines
--
under
the
respondents'
theory,
you
could
--
a
french
ambassador
could
be
attacked
by
a
frenchman
in
pennsylvania
and
have
alien
tort
statute
jurisdiction
and
a
claim
for
relief.
if
a
u.s.
citizen
attacked
the
french
ambassador
on
foreign
soil,
he
wouldn't
have
an
alien
tort
statute
claim;
he
would
be
sent
to
the
state
courts
if
he
could
--
the
state
courts
were
open,
which
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
purpose
of
the
alien
tort
statute,
the
fundamental
known
purpose
of
the
alien
tort
statute.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
congress
provided
for
some
jurisdiction
in
the
torture
victim
protection
act.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
the
alien
tort
statute
is
limited
to
alien
plaintiffs.
i
mean,
and
that
was
the
congressional
design,
and
it
was
--
that
arises
out
of
the
history,
to
make
sure
that
aliens
with
law
of
nations
claims
had
access
to
federal
courts
and
federal
remedies
to
vindicate
those
positions.
the
united
states
could
still
take
action
to
protect
the
u.s.
citizen.
can
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
then?
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
on
the
bradford
opinion.
i
think
if
you
read
the
diplomatic
materials
that
we
placed
before
the
court,
it's
absolutely
clear
that
what
the
british
were
concerned
about
was
pillaging
and
plundering
on
land
in
the
sierra
leone
colony.
they
were
seeking
redress
for
those
things,
for
destroying
libraries,
for
destroying
freetown,
not
just
about
things
that
happened
on
the
high
seas
and
not
just
about
things
that
happened
in
territorial
waters.
it's
absolutely
clear
that
that's
true,
but
obviously
you
have
those
materials
and
you
can
read
it.
and
attorney
general
bradford
said
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
was
an
ats
action.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
that's
true,
but
with
respect
to
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
is
a
u.s.
perpetrator
or
not.
and
it
shows
exactly
why
the
presumption
can
apply
because
it
would
undermine
the
very
purposes
of
the
statute
in
the
best
available
evidence
that
we
have
about
what
it
meant
in
the
era.
i
would
like
to
give
a
hypothetical
that
i
think
reveals
why
the
u.s.
government
position
should
not
be
accepted.
suppose
there
is
an
iranian
corporation
that
secretly
supplies
poison
gas
to
the
current
syrian
regime
in
order
to
kill
tens
of
thousands
of
kurdish
citizens.
and
suppose
after
the
asad
regime
is
overthrown,
those
--
the
documents
revealing
that
poison
gas
transfer
to
the
syrian
regime
was
made
public
and
that
iranian
corporation
does
business
in
the
united
states,
asylum
seekers
who
were
driven
out
by
the
poison
gas
attacks
are
in
the
united
states,
maybe
living
in
the
same
communities
as
the
plaintiffs
in
our
case,
having
gotten
asylum
in
this
case.
would
it
be
the
case
that
the
alien
tort
statute
should
not
apply
to
a
claim
of
aiding
and
abetting
the
asad
regime
and
murdering
tens
of
thousands
of
its
people?
it
is
the
modern
day
example
of
i.g.
farben.
is
it
the
case
that
a
modern
day
i.g.
farben
would
be
exempt
from
the
alien
tort
statute?
there
is
a
clear,
well-established
doctrine
of
aiding
and
abetting
in
international
law.
it
has
been
accepted
by
the
lower
courts.
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
rejected
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
respondents
in
this
case.
and
i
would
say
that
the
sosa
framework
is
--
should
be
given
a
chance
to
work.
this
court
dealt
with
these
issues
eight
years
ago.
it
set
up
a
historical
paradigm
test
based
on
many
of
the
concerns
that
have
been
expressed
here,
and
there
are
alternative
doctrines
that
can
be
applied
to
deal
with
these
concerns.
political
question,
active
state,
international
comity,
forum
non
conveniens,
personal
jurisdiction,
those
have
not
really
been
litigated.
whether
they
have
been
waived
or
not
is
something
that
the
lower
courts
can
deal
with.
whether
they
apply
the
lower
court--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--one
of
the
problems
that
we
would
have,
justice
ginsburg,
in
answering
that
question
is
that
there
is
no
record
about
the
contacts
between
these
defendants
and
--
and
the
jurisdiction
in
2002.
the
wiwa
case
for
example
where
it
was
litigated
was
dealt
on
a
factual
record
that
went
back
to
1996
and
1997.
so
there
is
no
record
here
about
personal
jurisdiction
because
it
hasn't
been
asserted.
now
if
the
defendants
have
not
in
fact
waived
personal
jurisdiction,
then
presumably
the
lower
courts
would
apply
the
tests
that
this
court
has
established
or
in
the
2011
decisions.
and
the
same
would
be
true
of
forum
non
conveniens
or
any
of
the
other
defenses.
they
have
raised
other
defenses
in
this
case
that
have
not
been
fully
litigated.
so
my
basic
position
is
that
the
sosa
framework
actually
is
--
works.
it
has
actually
weeded
out
cases.
these
alternative
doctrines
have
weeded
out
cases,
but
the
court
should
not
accept
the
categorical
positions
asserted
by
either
of
the
respondents,
which
are
the
broadest
categorical
positions
even
rejected
by
the
government,
or
the
government's
modified
categorical
position.
those
kinds
of
issues
can
be
dealt
with
within
well-established
doctrines
where
lower
courts
have
a
body
of
jurisprudence
that
they
can
use
to
do
this.
the
alien
tort
statute
as
was
applied
to
human
rights
cases
from
filartiga
on
is
part
of
a
trend
in
the
world
today.
the
trend
in
the
world
today
is
towards
universal
justice
for
people
that
--
and
corporations
that
violate
these
kinds
of
norms.
that's
the
trend.
in
fact,
the
united
states
has
been
the
leader
in
that.
our
government
has
proclaimed
our
leadership
position
to
u.n.
bodies
and
around
the
world.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
the
united
kingdom
and
netherlands
have
obviously
asserted
this
position.
but
the
netherlands
have
asserted
that
position
while
at
the
same
time
21
days
after
the
argument
in
february
a
dutch
court
gave
damages
to
a
palestinian
doctor
for
wrongful
imprisonment
and
torture
that
occurred
in
libya
against
two
libyan
defendants
that
were
not
even
present
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
it
may
have
been
but
actually
it
seems
perfectly
consistent
with
dutch
law,
it
is
consistent
with
the
exercise
of
universal
jurisdiction
in
many
pieces
of
legislation--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
the
dutch
government,
though,
and
one
of
the
significant
pieces
in
this
case
is
that
the
nigerian
government
doesn't
have
a
position
on
this
case
any
longer.
the
united
states
government
has
never
asked
for
this
case
to
be
dismissed
on
foreign
policy
grounds.
the
united
kingdom
and
dutch
government
have
never
asked
for
this
case
to
be
invalidated
on
foreign
policy
grounds.
they
have
stated
their
position
about
what
they
think
the
alien
tort
statute
should
mean.
and
if
you
look
at
the
european
union
brief,
of
which
the
united
kingdom
and
dutch
are
members,
the
european
union
says
there
is
no
issue
about
universal
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
issue
about
civil
jurisdiction
that
falls
within
universal
jurisdiction.
their
only
argument
is
that
if
you
accept
that
you
should
accept
international
opposition
and
exhaustion
of
local
remedies.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think
that
that's
probably
what
the
basis
of
the
dutch
position.
our
position,
though,
is
that
this
--
the
framework
that
this
court
established
in
sosa
to
take
the
pirates
of
the
18th
century
and
deal
with
the
alien
tort
statute
with
the
torturers
and
those
who
commit
genocide
in
the
21st
century
was
correct,
and
that
doesn't
need
a
radical
re-evaluation
as
suggested
by
the
respondents
and
the
united
states.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd--
