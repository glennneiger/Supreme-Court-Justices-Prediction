justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
counsel,
for
me,
the
case
turns
in
large
part
on
this:
page
17
of
the
red
brief.
it
says,
"international
law
does
not
recognize
corporate
responsibility
for
the
alleged
offenses
here.
"
and
the
--
one
of
the
--
the
amicus
brief
for
chevron
says,
"no
other
nation
in
the
world
permits
its
court
to
exercise
universal
civil
jurisdiction
over
alleged
extraterritorial
human
rights
abuses
to
which
the
nation
has
no
connection.
"
and
in
reading
through
the
briefs,
i
was
trying
to
find
the
best
authority
you
have
to
refute
that
proposition,
or
are
you
going
to
say
that
that
proposition
is
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
--
it
involves
your
whole
argument,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
--
in
the
area
of
international
criminal
law,
which
is
just
analogous,
i
recognize,
there
is
a
distinction
made
between
individuals
and
corporations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
agree
that
we
can
assume
that
filartiga
is
a
binding
and
important
precedent
for
the
second
circuit.
but
in
that
case
the
only
place
they
could
sue
was
in
the
united
states.
he
was
an
individual.
he
was
walking
down
the
streets
of
new
york,
and
the
victim
saw
him
walking
down
the
streets
of
new
york
and
brought
the
suit.
in
this
case,
the
corporations
have
residences
and
presence
in
many
other
countries
where
they
have
much
more
--
many
more
contacts
than
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
go
much
--
you
go
much
further.
suppose
an
american
corporation
commits
human
trafficking
with
u.s.
citizens
in
the
united
states.
under
your
view,
the
u.s.
corporation
could
be
sued
in
any
country
in
the
world,
and
it
would
--
and
that
would
have
no
international
consequences.
we
don't
look
to
the
international
consequences
at
all.
that's
--
that's
the
view
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
as
i
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
why
you
think
they
did
that?
i
mean,
for
us,
the
respondeat
superior
is
so
simple.
why
is
it
a
big
deal
in
international
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
wonder
if
you
don't
concede
away
too
much,
when
you
say
well,
there
is
a
difference
in
substance
and
--
and
remedy
and
questions
of
jury
trial,
damages
and
so
forth.
that's
domestic.
those
were
the
concerns
that
the
u.k.
and
the
netherlands
addressed
in
their
brief
as
saying
why
corporations
shouldn't
be
liable
for
acts
committed
on
foreign
--
foreign
territories.
that
was
the
whole
reasoning
of
--
of
--
of
the
u.k.
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
effects
that
commenced
in
the
united
states
or
that
are
closely
related
to
the
united
states
exist
between
what
happened
here
and
what
happened
in
nigeria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
just
to
make
it
clear--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
your
position
--
and
i
believe
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states;
i'm
not
sure
--
that
if
a
u.s.
corporation
commits
an
international
law
violation
in
the
united
states,
that
u.s.
corporation
can
be
sued
in
any
court
in
the
world?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
but
the
way
i
stated
the
hypothetical,
or
the
proposition,
that
is
your
beginning
proposition
--
although
there
might
be
some
defenses.
but
as
a
beginning
matter,
that
they
can
be
sued
in
any
country
in
any
court
in
the
world.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
assume--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
assume
a
violation
of
international
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
part
of
the
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know,
justice
alito
can
protect
his
own
hypothetical,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
walking
away
from
it.
the
question
as
i
understood
it
assumed
that
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
proceeding
with
this
particular
case
will,
because
of
some
other
reasons--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--involve
the
united
states
or
its
citizens
living
abroad
in
serious
complications
with
a
foreign
government.
that's
not
a
political
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
political
consequences,
but
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
--
there's
--
you
can't
cite
a
case
--
but
maybe
you
can,
please
do
if
you
can
--
that
this
is
part
of
the
political
question
doctrine.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
answer
would
apply
if
you
were
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question
in
the
affirmative
by
saying
that
there
is
1331
jurisdiction,
but
you
need
not
go
so
far,
given
sosa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
maybe
it's
just
history
and
background,
but
i
would
really
like
you
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question.
suppose
we
had
granted
cert
in
filartiga
before
congress
acted?
what
--
under
your
position,
what
should
have
been
the
result?
i
think
that
was
the
purport
of
her
question,
and
i
would
appreciate
an
answer
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
filartiga,
why
wasn't
there
an
aiding
and
abetting?
i
think
it
was
pretty
clear.
he
probably
was
working
for
the
government,
which
is
even
worse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
and
i
am
interested
in
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
assume
we
think
the
second
circuit
was
right,
pre-congressional
action
under
the
alien
tort
statute.
is
there
any
way
in
which
we
can
use
the
principle
of
extraterritoriality
to
rule
in
your
favor?
