justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there's
no
particular
connection
between
the
events
here
and
the
united
states.
so,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
there's
any
other
country
in
the
world
where
these
plaintiffs
could
have
brought
these
claims
against
the
respondents.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
there
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that
question
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
any
other
country
other
than
the
country
of
the
citizenship
of
the
defendants?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
have
all
the
judges
who
have
interpreted
that
opinion
interpreted
it
the
way
you
just
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
did
--
how
did
judge
kavanaugh
interpret
that
on
the
d.c.
circuit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
first
sentence
in
your
brief
and
the
statement
of
the
case
is
really
striking:
"this
case
was
filed
by
12
nigerian
plaintiffs
who
alleged
that
respondents
aided
and
abetted
the
human
rights
violations
committed
against
them
by
the
abacha
dictatorship
in
nigeria
between
1992
and
1995.
"
what
does
a
case
like
that
--
what
business
does
a
case
like
that
have
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
no
connection
to
the
united
states
whatsoever.
the
alien
tort
statute
was
enacted,
it
seems
to
be
--
there
seems
to
be
a
consensus,
to
prevent
the
united
states
--
to
prevent
international
tension,
to
--
and
--
does
this
--
and
this
kind
of
a
lawsuit
only
creates
international
tension.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
really
that
think
the
first
congress
wanted
victims
of
the
french
revolution
to
be
able
to
sue
in
--
in
the
court
--
to
sue
french
defendants
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
is
there
an
article
iii
source
of
jurisdiction
for
a
lawsuit
like
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
constitutional
basis
for
a
lawsuit
like
this,
where
an
alien
is
suing
an
alien?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
a
case
like
this
is
brought
in
the
united
states
and
the
state
department
tells
the
district
court
that
allowing
this
case
to
go
forward
will
have
a
very
deleterious
effect
on
u.s.
foreign
policy
and
on
the
welfare
of
u.s.
--
u.s.
citizens
abroad.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
district
court
says:
"well,
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it.
"
"this
case
is
just
going
to
go
forward.
"
that's
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
would
happen
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
district
court
won't
certify
a
question
for
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
it
was
the
corporation,
it
wouldn't
fall
under
the
torture--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
the
u.k.
--
the
u.k.
and
the
netherlands,
i
--
well,
i'll
ask
you.
do
you
disagree
that
those
are
fair
judicial
systems
where
a
plaintiff
can
get
a
fair
shake?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
then
what
does
this
case
--
why
does
this
case
belong
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--when
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
united
states
other
than
the
fact
that
a
subsidiary
of
the
defendant
has
a
big
operation
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
this
about
piracy?
in
1789,
do
you
think
that
congress
was
contemplating
tort
actions
against
pirates
in
courts
of
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
should
happen
when
the
injury
occurs
within
the
territory
of
a
foreign
country,
but
it
is
alleged
that
the
injury
was
directed
by
someone
in
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
were
a
u.s.
corporation,
but
the
case
were
otherwise
identical.
what
result
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
follow
up
on
the
question
i
asked
before.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
say
definitively
which
way
you
would
come
out
in
this
hypothetical
case,
but
from
your
brief
i
really
don't
understand
how
you
would
decide.
would
it
depend
--
what
would
it
depend
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
everything
is
the
same
except
for--
