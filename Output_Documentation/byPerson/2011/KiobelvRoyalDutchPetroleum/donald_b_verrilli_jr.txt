mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
alien
tort
statute
should
not
afford
a
cause
of
action
to
address
the
extraterritorial
conduct
of
a
foreign
corporation
when
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendant
aided
and
abetted
a
foreign
sovereign.
in
this
category
of
cases,
there
just
isn't
any
meaningful
connection
to
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it's
--
it's
a
narrower
statement
than
that,
justice
sotomayor.
it's
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
cause
of
action
to
address
the
extraterritorial
conduct
of
a
foreign
corporation
that
is
alleged
to
have
aided
and
abetted
the
acts
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
think
in
filartiga,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
--
the
--
that
there
is
a
nexus
to
the
united
states.
the
actual
perpetrator
was
--
a,
it
was
a
case
against
the
actual
perpetrator.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
b--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
our
reasons
for
why
filartiga
was
okay
is
that
--
that
it
was
the
actual
perpetrator,
not
an
aider
and
abettor,
and
the
actual
perpetrator
was
resident
in
the
united
states.
and
i
do
think
when
congress
enacted
the
tvpa,
that
is
what
congress
looked
to
as
the
salient
features
of
the
filartiga
situation
that
justified--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i
think
filartiga
is
the
paradigm,
and
cases
like
filartiga
are
the
paradigm
that
--
where
we
think
ats
--
ats
causes
of
action
should
be
recognized.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it's
a
new--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
in
a
case
like
this
one,
in
cases
under
the
alien
tort
statute,
the
united
states
has
multiple
interests.
we
certainly
have
foreign
relations
interests
in
avoiding
friction
with
foreign
governments;
we
have
interests
in
avoiding
subjecting
united
states
companies
to
liability
abroad.
we
also
have
interests
in
ensuring
that
our
nation's
foreign
relations
commitments
to
the
rule
of
law
and
human
rights
are
not
eroded.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it's
my
responsibility
to
balance
those
sometimes
competing
interests
and
make
a
judgment
about
what
the
position
of
the
united
states
should
be,
consistent
with
existing
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
we
have
done
so.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
we
think
they
are
persuasive,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
be
clear:
in
this
case
our
position
is
that
the
court
ought
not
recognize
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
in
that
case
the
possible
risk
of
foreign
relations
friction
would
be
comparable.
the
risk
of
reciprocal
exposure
to
american
companies
would
also
exist.
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
there'd
be
a
much
more
substantial
connection
to
the
united
states
because
it's
an
american
company.
the
question
in
the
case
would
be
whether
the
--
that
substantial
connection
provided
sufficient
justification
for
subjecting
the
united
states
company
to
these
international
law
norms
to
avoid
undermining
the
credibility
of
our
nation's
commitment
to
those
norms.
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
question
in
this
case
because
we
think
that
the
court
ought
to
proceed
incrementally
here.
the
case
before
the
court
involves
a
foreign
corporation
in
which
there
just
isn't
any
connection
to
the
united
states
at
all,
and
it's
our
judgment
that
the
court
should
decide
that
case--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--our
view
about
that,
justice
sotomayor,
is
that
the
key
determinant
here,
and
the
reason
why
there
ought
not
be
a
cause
of
action
here,
is
the
absence
of
any
meaningful
connection
to
the
united
states.
and
the
question
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
don't
think
that
the
question
of
the
availability
of
a
forum
or
nonavailability
of
a
forum
is
sufficient
to
override
the
absence
of
any
connection
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
will
say--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
a
weighing
of
the
strength
of
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
the
foreign
relations
interests
of
the
united
states,
in
applying
this
narrow
category
of
sosa
norms
in
order
to
avoid
undermining
the
credibility--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--congress
can
always
act
in
this
area,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
actually
what
we
are
advocating
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
can
make
categorical
judgments,
not
pure
case
by
case
factual
judgments.
we
just
think
there
is
more
than
one
category.
there
are
salient
differences
between
a
situation
like
this
one,
in
which
there
is
no
connection
to
the
united
states
at
all,
or
the
situation
like
the
one
justice
alito
raised
about
an
american
corporation.
and
there
are
also
cases
in
which
the
suit
is
against
a
direct
perpetrator.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
categories
are
evident
from
the
kinds
of
cases
that
have
been
brought.
but
certainly,
the
views
of
the
state
department
do
deserve
deference.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
what
we're
--
we're
not
--
we're
talking
about
something
different,
justice
sotomayor.
the
question
is
whether
to
recognize
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action.
i
think
that
depends
on--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
depends
on
a
weighing
of
interests,
i
believe,
your
honor,
and
that
there
are
interests
that
cut
against
recognizing
causes
of
acts
in
this
area,
and
that's
what
sosa
said.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
if
no
one
ever
came
to
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
it's
just
--
it's
not
--
the
connection
is
not
an
on/off
switch.
but
our
position
is
you
need
a
connection
in
order
to
assess
whether
there
is
even
an
interest
in
having
cause
of
action--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
it's
an
individual
perpetrator
like
filartiga
we
think
that
it
is
because
it's
the
direct
perpetrator.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
--
it
was
--
i
think
torture
has
to
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
it's
a
norm
that
has
to
be
violated
by--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
they
do
it
directly.
if
they
are
the
direct
violator
of
a
norm
that
they
can
violate
directly,
then
yes
they
can.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
then
if
it's
a
foreign
corporation
and
it
occurred
entirely
in
a
foreign
country.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
difference
is
that
while
you
would
have
a
comparable
--
you
would
have
a
risk
of
friction
in
subjecting
a
foreign
sovereign's
acts
to
scrutiny
in
the
united
states,
you
have
the
reciprocity
risk
i
mentioned.
you
would
have
to
make
a
judgment
about
whether
those
concerns
are
overcome
by
the
countervailing
concern
of
applying
the
--
finding
the
ats
cause
of
action
to
apply
u.s.
norms.
if
it's
an
entirely
foreign
corporation
with
no
connection
to
the
united
states,
our
position
is
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
