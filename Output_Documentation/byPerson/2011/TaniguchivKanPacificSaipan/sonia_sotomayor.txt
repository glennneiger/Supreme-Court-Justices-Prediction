justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
extent
of
your
argument?
are
you
saying
that
it's
interpretation,
oral
interpretation,
just
in
the
courtroom?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
have
to
say
that
if
you
read
it
the
way
you
do,
then
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
for
appointed
experts,
they
only
get
recompensed
for
the
time
they're
testifying,
because
that's
the
only
time
they
spend
in
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
court
experts
get--
a
--
get
paid
for
their
prep
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
--
one
further
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
take
all
your
arguments,
but
i
read
the
common
dictionary
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
primary
meaning
of
"interpreter"
is
interpretation
of
oral
languages.
but
the
dictionary
is
broad
enough
to
include
translation
work
as
well.
given
that
the
courts
for
70
years
have
been
awarding,
most
of
the
them
--
except
for
i
think
the
seventh
here,
virtually
every
court
over
a
70-year
period
has
been
awarding
translation
fees
as
--
as
authorized;
why
shouldn't
that
be
enough
for
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning,
if
the
dictionary
term
is
broad
enough
and
that's
what
the
courts
have
been
doing
and
the
world
hasn't
crashed,
despite
one
case
where
a
large
amount
was
given
--
your
adversary
points
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
translation
fees
tend
to
be
fairly
reasonable
--
why
should
we
muck
with
what
works?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
i
am
drawing
--
i
am
drawing
from
ways
that
my
colleague
next
to
me
usually
asks
a
question.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we
get
back
to
the
issue.
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision,
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
explicitly
rejected
translation
work
from
its
coverage?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
outside
of
the
text.
is
there
a
statement
by
one
of
the
sponsors
in
the
congressional
bill?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
are
the
other
provisions
that
they
passed
with
respect
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
if
a
lawyer
sits
down
with
an
interpreter
now
in
his
office
and
says
to
the
interpreter,
"i
can't
pay
for
translation
work.
"
"now,
you
sit
here
and
interpret
what
this
letter
says
for
me.
"
is
that
what
we're
asking
lawyers
to
do
now--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
we
accept
your
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
would
say
that
might
be
different
in
a
courtroom.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
the
lawyer
is
communicating
something
live.
it
could
be
in
the
courtroom,
but
not
outside.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
something
logical
about
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
i'm
--
i'm
having
a
problem
with
they're
"potentially
large".
interpretive
services
are
potentially
large,
although
you
claim
that
they
don't
--
they
have
sort
of
a
terminus
point.
i've
been
in
trials
where
we've
had
multiple
languages
simultaneously
being
translated
to
multiple
defendants,
with
witnesses
speaking
even
other
languages.
i
was
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
fees
there
without
translation,
just
for
the
oral
courtroom
work,
sometimes
went
ahead
for
months.
so
potentiality's
not
the
question.
if
you're
talking
about
disproportionality,
then
that
goes
to
the
word
"reasonable"
in
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
the
ortho
case
you
point
to,
the
court
did
sizably
cut
the
translation
fees.
and
more
importantly,
from
the
little
i
can
tell,
that
was
a
huge
patent
case
with
a
patent
that
was
claimed
to
control
60
percent
of
a
market.
so
i
don't
know
that
that
was
a
small
case
by
anyone's
definition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
far
back
as
19
--
it
was
a
district
court.
but
it
was
as
far
back
as
the
1930s.
some
in
the
'40s,
some
in
the
'50s.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
clearly.
but
these
awards
have
been
common.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
like
daring
justice
alito
to
go
do
this
now.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
justice
breyer
is
asking,
can
you
think
of
an
example
where
words
are
not
on
their
face
plain,
and
the
court
has
looked
to
the
practices
that
have
been
impugned
into
that
word
incentive
and
we
decided
that
they
will
be
accepted
in
the
way
that
practice
has
given
them
meaning?
