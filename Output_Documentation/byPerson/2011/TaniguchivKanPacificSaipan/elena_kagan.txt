just
out
of
curiosity,
why
do
you
think
that
all
these
courts
just
took
for
granted
the
opposite
reading?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
aren't
you
asking
for
an
interpretive
principle
that
errs
on
the
side
of
breadth
rather
than
narrowness?
justice
elena
kagan
why
don't
we
just
ask
ourselves
what's
the
most
common,
what's
the
best
reading?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
dictionaries
themselves
tell
us
that
one
usage
is
far
more
common
than
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
about
in
the
u.s.
code?
is
there
any
place
in
the
u.s.
code
where
the
word
interpreters
clearly
encompasses
written
translators?
justice
elena
kagan
so
in
every
other
case
where
the
u.s.
code
uses
the
word
"interpreters"
means
only
oral
translators,
and
that's
the
obvious
way
to
use
the
word,
but
in
this
case
we
are
supposed
to
reach
a
different
conclusion?
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
know,
mr.
himmelfarb.
why
is
this
any
--
any
different
from
than
any
other
case
in
which
we
draw
the
line,
and
we
find
that
the
result
of
drawing
the
line
is
that
we
have
created
some
close
cases,
cases
that
are
near
the
line.
so,
you
know,
just
to
give
you
an
obvious
example,
the
fact
that
there
are
some
few
minutes
in
every
24-hour
period
where's
it's
hard
to
say
that
something
is
night
or
day
does
not
mean
that
there
is
no
night
and
that
there
is
not
day.
and
that
seems
to
me
what
the
question
is
here.
here
you
can
think
of
some
hard
cases,
but
they
are
just
that,
they
are
marginal
cases.
