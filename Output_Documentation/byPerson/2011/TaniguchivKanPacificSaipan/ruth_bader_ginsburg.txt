that's

a
contract
in
another

and
the

--

interpreter
interprets
it?

but
what
if
the
--
if
the
interpreter,
being
diligent,
said,
i'm
going
to
have
to
translate
this
document
in
open
court,
i
would
like
to
have
it
in
advance
so
i
can
be
sure
that
my
translation
is
going
to
be
accurate,
so
that
in
fact
the
interpreter
looks
at
the
document
and
in
in
preparation
for
the
trial
translates
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
depositions?
the
translation
would
be
of
the
spoken
word,
but
it
wouldn't
be
in
court.

mr.
himmelfarb,
in
section
1920,
there
are
two
provisions
that
specify
costs
necessarily
obtained
for
use
in
the
case.
and
the
interpreter
provision
doesn't
have
that
qualification,
doesn't
say
necessarily
obtained
for
use
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
asking
to
read
interpreter
means
to
mean
translator
as
well,
and
to
import
into
sub
(6)
"necessary
for
use
in
the
case.
