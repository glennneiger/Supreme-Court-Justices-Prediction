justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
your
interpretation
make
sense?
shouldn't
we
view
this
against
the
backdrop
of
the
american
rule
on
fees,
that
each
party
generally
bears
its
own
costs
and
only
in
specific
circumstances
does
the
loser
pay?
now,
the
taxation
of
costs
is
a
very
narrow
concept.
what
is
the
difference
between
a
case
in
which
a
lot
of
documents
have
to
be
rendered
from
one
language
to
another
prior
to
the
court
proceeding
and
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
mass
of
scientific
evidence
that
has
to
be
interpreted
by
a
scientist?
or
financial
evidence
that
has
to
be
interpreted
by
an
accountant?
in
those
instances,
the
losing
party
doesn't
pay
for
the
winner's
expenses,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
back
up.
costs
get
taxed,
but
costs
are
very
narrow
and
they
are
a
very
small
part
of
the
expenses
of
a
party
litigating
a
case.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
somebody
did
a
computer
search
in
the
database
of,
let's
say,
newspaper
articles
and
magazine
articles
for
use
of
the
term
"interpreter"
in
relationship
to
a
foreign
language.
and
let's
say
you
look
at
1,000
hits.
how
many
of
those
do
you
think
would
use
the
term
"interpreter"
to
refer
to
rendering
a
written
document
from
one
language
to
another?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
much
would
you
bet?
[laughter]
if
you
bet
me
enough,
i
will
look
at
1,000,
i
would
be
surprised
if
it's
2
percent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
concerns
the
terms
"interpreter"
and
"translator".
a
federal
statute,
28
u.s.c.
section
1920
entitles
the
prevailing
party
in
a
civil
case
to
recover
certain
costs
from
the
loosing
party.
the
court
interpreters
act
amended
this
provision
to
include
"compensation
of
interpreters".
the
question
here
is
whether
compensation
of
interpreters
covers
the
costs
of
producing
english
language
versions
of
documents
that
are
written
in
another
language.
this
is
a
personal
injury
suit
brought
by
a
professional
japanese
basketball
player,
kouichi
taniguchi
against
the
owner
of
a
property
on
which
the
plaintiff
was
injured,
kan
pacific
saipan.
the
plaintiff
lost
the
case
and
the
district
court
awarded
costs
to
the
defendant.
these
costs
included
the
expense
of
translating
from
japanese
to
english
certain
documents
that
the
defendant
used
in
preparing
its
defense.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
award.
it
concluded
that
compensation
of
interpreters
is
not
limited
to
the
cost
of
translating
live
speech
but
reasonably
encompasses
the
cost
of
translating
written
documents.
we
disagree.
because
the
term
"interpreter"
is
not
defined
in
the
statute,
we
give
the
word
its
ordinary
meaning
and
it
is
not
customary
to
speak
of
the
interpretation
of
a
written
document
from
one
language
into
another.
instead,
the
term
that
is
customarily
used
is
"translation".
at
the
time
of
the
statute's
enactments
--
enactment,
dictionaries
uniformly
define
"interpreter"
to
include
persons
who
translate
orally
but
only
a
handful
define
the
word
broadly
enough
to
encompass
translators
of
written
materials.
one
of
the
few
dictionaries
in
the
latter
category
was
the
oxford
english
dictionary,
but
the
oed's
treatment
is
illustrative.
the
oed
stated
that
the
use
of
the
term
"interpret"
to
refer
to
the
translation
of
written
documents
had
become
obsolete.
any
definition
of
the
word
that
is
absent
from
many
dictionaries
and
is
deemed
obsolete
in
others
is
hardly
a
common
or
ordinary
meaning.
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
the
term
"interpreter"
is
normally
understood
as
one
who
translates
orally
from
one
language
to
another.
nothing
in
the
court
interpreters
act
or
in
other
provisions
of
section
1920
hints
that
congress
intended
to
go
beyond
this
ordinary
meaning.
all
of
this
is
explained
in
greater
detail
in
our
opinion.
for
anyone
who
is
interested,
the
opinion
is
written
in
english.
anybody
[laughter]
who
wants
to
read
it
in
another
language
will
have
to
pay
to
have
it
translated
[laughter]
not
interpreted.

in
which
justice
breyer
and
justice
sotomayor

joined.
