justice

scalia
it's
wrong
is
your
answer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
it
was
dr.
johnson's
answer
when
a
lady
pointed
out
an
error
in
his
dictionary
and
his
answer
was:
"stupidity,
madam,
sheer
stupidity.
"
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
didn't
understand
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
webster's
third,
as
i
recall,
is
the
dictionary
that
defines
"imply"
to
mean
"infer"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
"infer"
to
mean
"imply".
it's
not
a
very
good
dictionary.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
--
i
thought
we
were
addressing
not
whether
it's
a
good
idea
to
give
fees,
but
whether
fees
are
payable
under
this
particular
statute,
right?
which
was
enacted
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
1978.
that's
not
so
long
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
so
without--
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
ever
seen
a
book,
you
know,
translated
from
a
foreign
language,
you
know,
"war
and
peace",
you
know,
and
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
what
we
call
the
translator,
and
it
says
on
the
fly
page,
you
know,
"john
smith",
comma,
"trans",
period.
does
it
ever
say
"john
smith",
comma,
"int",
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't.
it
reflects
that
judgment
only
if
you
are
right
that
"interpreter"
means
"translator".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
are
begging
the
question.
you
could
say
that
the
one
should
embrace
the
other.
but
whether
congress
thought
that
or
not
is
mostly
dependent
on
the
language
congress
used,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
black's
law
dictionary
which
--
the
editor
of
it
is
a
--
is
co-author
with
me,
so
i
--
i
feel
obliged
to
spring
to
his
defense--
[laughter]
since
it
is
a
law
dictionary,
presumably
it
ought
to
have
taken
into
account
the
cases
you
are
referring
to,
many
of
which
use
the
word
in
--
in
this
sense,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
garner.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
there
is
no
legislative
history
--
there's
--
legislative
history
on
the
other
side
either,
right?
saying
that
we
--
we
mean
this
to
include--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
absent
legislative
history,
i
guess
we
have
to
rely
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
--
is
it
clear?
does
anybody
contend
--
does
the
other
side
contend
that
the
use
of
a
viva
voce
translation
outside
of
court
is
covered
by
the
meaning
of
interpreter
here.
i
assume
the
interpretation
here
meant
interpretation
in
the
oral
proceeding
that
is
the
trial.
and
you
are
--
you
are
saying
that
if
we
hold
against
you,
interpretation
will
still
include
all
oral
translations
outside
of
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
deposition,
which
i
consider
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
trial
process,
but
not
--
not
in
the
lawyer's
office
where
he
asks
somebody
to
sit
down
and
--
and
read
this
document
to
me.
