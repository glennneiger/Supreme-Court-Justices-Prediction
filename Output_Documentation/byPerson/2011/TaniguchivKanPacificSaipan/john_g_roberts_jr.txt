chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1472,
kouichi
taniguchi
v.
kan
pacific
saipan,
limited.
mr.
fried.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
--
but
she's
not
interpreting
it.
she's
already
got
the
thing
in
whatever
language,
english,
i
guess.
but
i
mean,
she's
not
interpreting,
she's
reading
the
english
translation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical,
then.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
a
situation
where
you
have
got
a
--
a
--
a
document
in
--
in,
say,
french
and
the
person
translates
it,
or
interprets
it
--
i
don't
want
to
prejudge
the
issue
--
and
--
and
then
in
english
and
then
the
person
reads
the
english
thing
in
--
in
court.
that's
not
interpretation
at
any
point,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
--
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me
is
the
impact
of
--
of
cost
allowance
on
the
normal
litigation
incentives.
an
interpreter
in
court
is
one
thing.
when
you
suddenly
get
a
situation
where
the
costs
could
be
quite
large,
particularly
in
a
--
in
a
disparate
way,
not
necessarily
shared
by
both
sides;
somebody
goes
into
court;
they
know
they
are
going
to
have
to
--
if
they
lose,
they
will
have
to
pay
the
interpreter
this;
and
the
other
side
comes
in
and
says
well,
we
think
we
need
to
submit
this
10,000
pages
of
--
of
documents,
which
will
have
to
be
translated
and
by
the
way,
if
you
lose
you
are
going
to
pay
for
that.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
much
more
variable
element
of
costs
than
the
interpreter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
--
so
what
goes
into
the
exercise
of
that
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
are
two
--
there
may
be
two
permissible,
but
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
it
is
more
natural
and
common
to
speak
of
someone
interpreting
oral
communication
and
someone
translating
written,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
rephrase
your
answer
a
different
way.
you
are
not
--
you
don't
know
of
any
situation
in
the
u.s.
code
where
translators
--
or
the
interpreter
means
translator?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
checked
every
one,
so
there
is
none,
right?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
odd
result
because
nobody's
going
to
do
it.
because
at
that
point
you
don't
know
who
is
going
to
get
saddled
with
the
cost.
so
it
wouldn't
be
likely
that
you
would
do
something
that
would
increase
the
costs,
would
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fried,
you
have
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1472,
taniguchi
versus
kan
pacific
saipan.
