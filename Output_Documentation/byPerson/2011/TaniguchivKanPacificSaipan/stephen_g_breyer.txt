there
are
--
there
are
lots
of
regions
of
the
country,
puerto
rico
for
example,
where
there
are
vast
numbers
of
documents
that
have
to
be
translated
if
you
go
into
federal
court,
not
necessarily
in
the
commonwealth
court.
that's
expensive
to
people.
and
they
might
have
thought
for
a
long
time,
while
that
expense
won't
go
away,
it's
at
least
better
to
have
it
paid
by
the
loser
than
to
have
it
paid
by
the
winner.
so
that's
been
the
common
practice.
i
don't
think
that's
a
foolish
approach.
and
you
can
find
language
in
this,
which
is
to
go
back
--
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
you
think
of
the
--
i
mean,
the
first
circuit
dealt
with
this,
which
deals
a
lot
with
puerto
rico,
and
it
felt
that
this
fell
within
the
idea
of
fees
for
exemplification,
which
is
certifying
the
document.
and
in
fact,
to
certify
a
document
that
comes
into
the
federal
court
in
san
juan,
you
have
to
have
it
translated
very
often.
and
so,
the
translation
cost
is
at
least
consistent
with
the
idea
there
of
trying
to
--
you
may
--
you
don't
have
to
--
you
may
impose
the
cost
on
the
loser.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
haven't
--
i
was
interested
here
that
the
amici
on
your
side
consists
of
some
professors
and
the,
i
guess
the
trade
associations
of
interpreters
or
translators,
but
the
people
who
would
have
the
financial
stake
in
it,
the
defense
bar,
the
plaintiff's
bar
in
certain
circumstances,
have
not
filed
any
brief.
and
i
tend,
though
not
putting
a
lot
of
weight
on
it,
to
take
it
as
a
sign,
along
with
the
long
period
of
time,
that
there
hasn't
been
some
tremendous
financial
problem.
what
evidence
is
there
that
there
has
been?
i
see
a
few
cases,
but
in
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plain
language
argument
i
got.
but
how
many
years
has
the
great
bulk
of
the
court
been
going
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
years
has,
would
you
say,
the
great
bulk
of
the
federal
system
been
deciding
this
differently
from
the
way
you
think
it
should
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
bulk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
when
did
all
this
rot
set
in,
in
your
opinion.
how
long?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
is
the
first
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
a
case
cited
from
1812.
i
take
it
that's
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
on
the
--
i
guess
nobody
wants
to
defend
this
argument,
including
you,
but
the
first
circuit
and
several
others
did
look
to
the
provision
which
permits
the
taxing
of
costs
with
the
making
of
specific
exemplifications
or
official
documents,
for
the
costs
of
making
copies
of
any
materials
obtained
for
use
in
the
case.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
copy
for
use
of
the
case
of
something
in
japanese,
you
are
going
to
have
to
turn
it
into
english.
so
they
included
that
as
part
of
the
costs
of
making
copies
of
the
materials
and
documents
for
use
in
the
case.
now,
which
is
discretionary;
it's
whether
you
do
or
whether
you
don't.
but
that's
how
several
courts
could
read
it.
i
am
just
wondering,
that
didn't
strike
me
as
so
obviously
wrong.
maybe
it's
obviously--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
am
sure
you
would
like
to
win
on
any
subsection.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
history
is
that
prior
to
'78
a
serious
number
--
some
number
of
circuits
said
you
can
get
the
translation
paid
for
under
--
as
--
as
being
necessary
to
create
a
copy
that
is
usable
in
court.
then
congress
passes,
this
knowing
of
those
cases
in
principle,
and
then
there
is
a
shift
after
congress
passes
this,
and
then
the
majority
of
courts
say,
all
right,
this
is
the
provision
that
permits
it.
is
that
an
accurate
statement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
the
'78
statute
which
suggested
that
congress
didn't
want
these
taxed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
means
you
don't
have
to
look
at
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
accept
the
following,
that
there
was
a
history
basically
giving
--
doing
what
you
want
before
the
statute,
but
the
statute,
nobody
thought,
was
going
to
do
that
history,
that
statute
is
capable
of
being
translated
but
it
is
a
most
natural
thing.
and
so,
the
question
is,
do
we
take
--
go
with
the
smaller
capabilities
and
leave
well
enough
alone
or
do
we
say,
gee,
that
is
just
too
hard
to
translate
that
--
to
interpret
the
statute
that
way.
have
you
got
any
other
examples
in
the
law?
i
mean,
can
you
think
of
an
example
in
the
law
which
i
have
been
trying
to
think
of
where
there
was
a
history
of
doing
something?
the
statute
comes
along
that
makes
it
a
little
tougher
for
the
judges
to
do
it.
and
then
the
court
says
either,
sorry,
too
tough
now,
or
it
says
let
sleeping
dogs
lie.
