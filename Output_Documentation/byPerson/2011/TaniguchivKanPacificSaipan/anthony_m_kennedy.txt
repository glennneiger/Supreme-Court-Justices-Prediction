justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
true
that
as
a
matter
of
common
usage,
when
we
are
talking
about
oral
testimony
in
court
we
often
use
"interpretation"
and
"translation"
or
"interpreter"
and
"translator"
somewhat
interchangeably,
but
when
we're
talking
about
rendering
a
document
into
a
--
into
a
different
language,
we
generally
talk
about
that
as
"translation".
this
is
a
matter
of
common
usage.
do
you
think
that's
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
wasn't
quite
my
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
point
was
that
i
think
we
say
--
in
fact,
in
a
supreme
court
case,
we
said
in
the
hernandez
case,
when
we're
talking
about
oral
testimony
in
court,
we
tend
to
use
"translator"
or
"translate"
and
"interpreter"
and
"interpret"
somewhat
interchangeably.
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
--
what's
your
position?
i
--
i
take
a
deposition
in
my
law
office
and
i
have
to
have
an
interpreter
there.
is
that
recoverable
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
do
you
think
it
affects
the
way
you
read
the
statute?
what
do
you
think
should
be
the
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
in
the
background
here,
is
there
some
concern
that
we're
going
to
have
minor
cases
but
with
huge
translation
costs,
and
it
would
be
simply
unfair?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
isn't
that
taken
care
of
by
the
statutory
direction
that
the
court
"may"
give
costs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
in
other
words,
if
the
court
sees
that
the
--
the
cost
of
preparing
documents
into
an
english
language
is
quite
substantial
in
light
of
what's
involved
in
the
case,
and
it's
just
not
fair
to
award
them,
can't
that
court
in
its
discretion
deny
them,
or
is
that
not
the
way
it
works?
