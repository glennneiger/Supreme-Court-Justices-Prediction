mr.
dan
himmelfarb
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
word
"interpreter"
has
two
possible
meanings
that
are
relevant
here,
a
broader
one
and
a
narrower
one.
the
broader
meaning
is
a
person
who
translates
from
one
language
to
another.
under
this
definition
the
terms
"interpreter"
and
"translator"
are
used
interchangeably.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
it
is
used
in
the
narrower
sense
in
that
context,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
the
narrower
meaning
of
"interpreter"
is
member
of
a
profession
that
specializes
in
oral
translation;
and
in
that
narrower
sense,
an
interpreter
is
distinct
from
a
translator,
which
is
the
sense
you've
just
identified,
which
is
a
person
who
specializes
in
written
translation.
our
submission
is
that,
as
the
great
majority
of
courts
who
have
expressed
a
view
on
this
question
have
recognized,
the
broader
definition
makes
more
sense
in
the
particular
context
at
issue
here.
and
we
say
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
basic
purpose
of
translation
in
the
litigation
context
is
to
make
evidence
intelligible
to
the
parties
and
the
court.
section
1920
reflects
the
congressional
judgment
that
the
cost
of
making
evidence
intelligible
to
the
parties
and
the
court
can
be
borne
by
the
losing
party.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
let
me
be
as
clear
as
i
possibly
can.
i'm
obviously
not
standing
here
saying
we
lose
under
the
language,
but
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
the
statute
to
cover
written
translation.
that's
not
a
legitimate
enterprise
for
a
court
interpreting
a
statute.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
text
of
the
statute
bears
two
--
permissibly
bears
two
possible
meanings.
that
being
the
case,
it
is
a
legitimate
enterprise
for
the
court
to
say
which
makes
sense,
which
is
it
most
likely
that
congress
would
have
intended
in
this
particular
context?
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
let
me
--
let
me
address
the
first
part
of
your
question
first,
which
is
essentially,
as
i
understand
it,
isn't
there
a
background
principle
that
says
costs
don't
get
taxed?
i
actually
think
insofar
as
far
as
tax
--
costs
are
concerned,
as
distinct
from
attorney's
fees,
the
background
principle
actually
goes
the
other
way.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
ordinarily
that
is
true,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
follows,
it
follows
in
any
way,
that
there
is
some
sort
of
tie-breaking
interpretive
canon
that
says
when
you
are
interpreting
the
costs
statute,
some
version
of
which
has
been
in
effect
since
the
middle
of
the
19th
century,
if
you
are
unsure
about
the
scope
of
it,
that
you
err
on
the
side
of
narrowness
rather
than
breadth.
i
just
don't
think
there
is
any
such
interpretive
principle.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
we
don't.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i
think
you
obviously
have
to
start
there
in
this
case,
as
you
do
in
any
statutory
case;
and
our
submission
is
that
you
have
two
possible
ordinary
definitions.
you
have
two
possible
common
usages.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
mean,
i
guess
i
just
have
to
dispute
that.
we
have
webster's,
which,
you
know,
justice
scalia's
view
notwithstanding,
is
viewed
by
many
people
as
an
authoritative
dictionary
of
english
language.
we
have
got
black's
law
dictionary
which
i
think
everyone
agrees
is
the
leading
law
dictionary,
which
provides
as
a
definition
of
"interpreter"
the
broad
definition
that
we
advocate
here.
to
be
sure--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
true,
and
just
as
a
dictionary,
a
law
dictionary
will
take
those
cases
into
account,
i
think
it's
ordinarily
presumed
that
congress
is
taking
into
account
the
cases,
too,
and
it's
taking
into
account
dictionary
definitions
as
well.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
i
think
in
large
litigations
where
you
have
many,
many
days
of
trial
and
potentially
pretrial
proceedings,
you
could
have
very
large
oral
translation
costs.
where
there
are
many
depositions,
you
could
have
large
oral
translation
costs.
but
even
if
i
were
to
accept
the
premise
of
your
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
these
costs
get
controlled
is
through
the
exercise
of
district
court's
discretion,
not
to
tax
every
--
the
cost
of
translating
every
document.
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
one
of
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
typically
the
criteria
for
--
i
should
add,
the
criteria
for
taxing
costs
of
every
sort,
not
just
interpreter
costs
and
not
just
document
translation
costs,
are
essentially
thought
to
be
necessity
and
reasonableness.
so
in
connection
with
document
translation
costs,
the
fifth
circuit
has
suggested
that
the
way
to
tax
them,
the
appropriate
way
to
tax
them
might
be
just
to
tax
the
cost
of
translating
headings
of
foreign
language
documents,
which
should
be
sufficient
to
let
the
lawyer
know
whether
this
is
a
relevant
document
that
might
bear
further
translation,
and
then
only
the
documents
that
really
turned
out,
based
on
the
translation
of
the
heading,
to
have
some
significance
to
the
case.
so
that's
just
one
example
of
the
way
the
discretion
gets
exercised.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that
--
that's
true.
for
--
for--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--the
necessity
limitation
in
subsection
(6)
as
with
other
subsections
that
don't
specifically
use
the
word
54
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
essentially
make
this
a
discretionary
call
for
the
district
courts.
necessity
has
long
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
components
of
that
discretionary
determination.
the
reason
we
say
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
the
narrower
definition
of
interpreter
be
the
one
that
congress
enacted
is
that
written
document
translation
can
be
and
often
is
every
bit
as
important
as
oral
translation.
in
many
cases,
it
could
be
more
important,
in
a
contract
case,
for
example.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
i
mean,
i
suppose
it
goes
without
saying
that
we
would
rather
win
under
subsection
(4)
than
lose
under
subsection
(6).
there
are--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
true,
absolutely
true.
there
are
some
courts
that
have
suggested
that
document
translation
fits
under
subsection
(4).
i
think
those
that
have
done
so
have
tended
to
do
it
--
tended
to
do
it
before
section
(6)
was
added
in
1978.
we
haven't--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
that
is
accurate.
before
1978
some
of
the
courts
that
taxed
document
translation
costs
i
believe
also
relied
on
their
inherent
authority,
which
at
the
time
was
thought
to
be
a
permissible
ground
for
taxing
costs.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
absolutely
not.
there
is
--
there
is
frankly
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
court
interpreters
act
really
that
bears
on
this
issue
one
way
or
another.
there
is
a
lot
of
legislative
history
on
which
petitioner
relies,
but
it's
all
addressed
to
section
2,
which
is
a
separate
provision
which
deals
with
a
separate
subject,
which
is
the
appointment
of
interpreters
in
cases
initiated
by
the
united
states.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
that's
right.
we
don't
--
we--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
guess
i
just
go
back
to
where
i
started,
which
is
that
we
think
under
dictionary
definitions
and
under
common
usage
there
are
two
permissible
meanings
of
interpreter.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
i
would
dispute
it.
i
don't
know
whether
one
is
more
common
than
the
other
in
any
meaningful
way.
it
may
be
slightly
more
common
to
use
it
in
its
narrower
sense
to
refer
to
a
member
of
a
profession,
but
it
certainly
is
common
enough
that
you
have
district
judges
from
all
over
the
country
in
written
opinion
just
sort
of
matter-of-factly
talking
about
the
people
who
translate
documents
as
interpreters.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
there
aren't
--
there
--
i
frankly
don't
think
there
are
that
many
places
in
the
united
states
code
where
the
term
"interpreter"
is
used
other
than
in
its
sort
of
obvious,
narrowest
sense
based
on
the
context
of
a
statute.
so,
for
example,
a
number
of
statutes
talk
about
funding
translators
and
interpreters
who
are
not
citizens
of
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
that
context
what
congress
is
getting
at
is
the
interpreter
and
translator
in
the
narrower
sense
of
members
of
a
profession.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
kagan,
i
would
say
this,
in
every
other
provision
of
the
united
states
code
in
which
the
interpreter
--
the
word
"interpreter"
is
used,
either
it's
not
clear
whether
it
includes
document
translation
or
the
context
is
such
that
it
strongly
indicates
that
it's
limited
to
oral
translation.
and
neither
of
those
situations
obtains
here,
in
our
view.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
provision
in
the
united
states
code.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
there
is
--
there
is
none
where
it
is
clear
that
it
covers
document
translation.
there
are
--
there
are
state
statutes
which
we
have
cited
which
use
the
term
"interpreter"
to
--
to
clearly
cover
document
translation,
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
would
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
it
was
more
than
50
percent
of
the
hits
that
used
it
in
its
narrower
sense.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
however--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
couldn't
venture
a
guess,
and
i
would
rather
not
bet
you.
[laughter]
i
do
want
to
say
something
about
the
concept
of
sight
translation,
which
is
something
that
my
friend
mr.
fried
averted
to.
sight
translation
is
a
hybrid
endeavor.
it
is
the
oral
translation
of
written
documents.
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
that
the
broader
meaning
of
interpreter
makes
more
sense
in
section
1920
is
that
it
can't
really
account
in
any
sensible
way
for
sight
translation.
in
this
case,
for
example,
our
counsel
--
kan
pacific's
counsel
took
taniguchi's
deposition.
and
to
prepare
for
the
deposition,
he
reviewed
--
he
had
to
review
some
contracts
which
were
written
in
japanese
and
some
medical
records
which
were
written
in
japanese.
now,
under
our
view,
having
those
documents
translated
in
writing
to
prepare
for
the
deposition,
would
result
in
a
potentially
taxable
cost.
under
taniguchi's
view,
they
wouldn't.
but
it
sounds
like
under
either
party's
view,
if
instead
of
handing
those
documents
off
to
a
document
translator
to
have
them
translated
in
writing,
he
had
sat
down
in
his
law
office
with
a
member
of
the
interpreter
profession
and
said
here's
a
box
of
documents,
please,
tell
me
what
they
say.
that
would
potentially
be
a
taxable
cost.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
odd
result
and
one
that's--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
would
increase
the
costs.
it
may
be
cheaper
to
use
an
oral
translator
--
an
--
an
oral
translator
as
opposed
to
a
written
document
translator.
and
there
might
be
a
variety
of
reasons
why
you
would
choose
to
use
one
or
another,
time
constraints,
the
importance
of
the
particular
document,
what
have
you.
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
likely
that
congress
would
have
thought
that
the
potential
taxability
of
the
translation--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
think
every
court
that's
ever
thought
about
this
has
found
that
deposition
--
oral
translation
at
deposition--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
there's
--
i
don't
see
any
basis
in
the
statute
or,
frankly,
in
the
practice
of
translators
or
interpreters
of
drawing
that
line
in
that
particular
place.
and
as
far
as
the
question
of
where
taniguchi
would
the
court
--
court
draw
its
concern,
i
think
that
is
a
very
hard
question
to
answer,
because
he
has
moved
back
and
forth
so
many
times
on
that.
his
briefs
offer
several
different
--
several
different
narrower
definitions
of
interpreter,
sometimes
saying
it's
the
oral
translation
of
oral
speech.
sometimes
saying
it's
the
oral
translation
of
any
language,
whether
it's
oral
or
written.
sometimes
saying
it's
limited
to
in-court
interpretation.
sometimes
it's
saying
it's
not.
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
very
good
reason
for
adopting
the
broader
interpretation.
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
congress
would
want
courts
to
get
into
these
extremely
complicated
and,
frankly,
unprincipled
line
drawing
exercises.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
--
i
think
line
drawing
is
sometimes
a
necessary
exercise
because
the
text
of
the
statute
compels
you
to
do
it.
our
submission
is
that
the
text
of
this
statute
doesn't
compel
it,
because
you
have
a
readily
available
alternative
interpretation
which
doesn't
require
any
sorts
of
these
line
drawings.
and
as
far
as
whether
this
is
sort
of
a
--
an
outlying
--
the
examples
i
give
are
outlying
oddball
circumstances
goes,
i
don't
think
they
are.
sight
translation,
for
example,
is
a
core
function
of
interpreters
and
translators
alike.
and
i
guess
the
only
other
point
i
would
say
--
make
about
sight
translation,
my
friend,
mr.
fried
suggested
that
that
--
that
is
something
that
could
only
be
covered
if
it
takes
place
during
the
course
of
live
proceedings,
which
i
think
is
yet
another
narrowing
of
the
word
"interpreter".
but
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
most
sight
translation
is
little,
if
any,
sight
translation
actually
occurs
during
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
i
think
--
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
an
important
point.
and
this
goes
to
the
question
of,
you
know,
whether
it's
difficult
for
district
courts
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
a
particular
document
translation
should
be
taxed,
which
is
one
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side.
i
think
the
history
of
this
is
strong
evidence
that
it's
not
difficult.
courts
have
been
doing
this,
certainly,
since
1978
when
this
provision
was
added
and
even
before
then.
and
they
haven't
had
any
evident
difficulty
in
deciding
whether
to
tax
documents
in
its
document
translation,
and
if
so,
how
much.
so
i
think
the
--
the
history
certainly
bears
on
the
case
in
that
respect.
a
word--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
can't
think
of
any
case
off
the
top
of
my
head,
and
i
think
it's
true
that
this
case
is
a
little
bit
different,
because
insofar
as
courts
were
taxing
document
translation
costs
before
1978,
they
were
relying
on
something
other
than
the
word
"interpreter".
so
it
may
be
a
stretch
to
say
that
when
congress
chose
to
use
the
word
"interpreter",
it
was
necessarily
incorporating
what
courts
had
previously
done.
but
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
irrelevant
that
this
has
been
done
for
a
long
time,
and
i
think
it's
not
unfair
to
presume
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
that.
the
court
interpreters
act
has
two
main
provisions
as
relevant
here.
there's
section
2,
which
is
really
the
more
--
the
main
provision
--
and
then
section
7,
which
became
1920(6)
in
title
28,
which
is
the
provision
at
issue
here.
an
important
part
of
taniguchi's
submission
is
that
section
2
is
limited
to
oral
translators,
and
therefore,
it
should
follow
that
section
7,
the
provision
at
issue
here,
is
likewise
limited
to
oral
translators.
and
our
main
submission
on
that
--
on
that
question
is
that
congress
actually
used
different
language
in
section
2
and
section
7.
section
2
added
two
provisions
to
title
28:
section
1827
and
section
1828,
which
are
titled,
and
which
address,
respectively,
interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states,
and
special
interpretation
services.
in
section
7,
which
added
subsection
(6)
to
1920,
congress
does
not
use
those
two
phrases.
instead,
it
uses
the
phrase
"interpreters"
simply,
not
"interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
and
then
"special
interpretation
services".
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
appropriate
canon
about
the
use
of
similar
or
different
language
in
different
provisions
of
a
statute,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appropriate
canon
is
that
one
should
presume
that
when
congress
uses
different
language,
it
intends
different
meanings.
i
do
want
to
respond
to
mr.
fried's
point
about
the
number
of
times
the
word
2.
and
as
i
understand
his
point,
it's
that
--
it's
that
it
is
much
more
frequently
used
by
itself
than
it
is
with
the
--
with
the
words
"in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
what
the
statute
actually
does
is
add
--
say
that
it's
adding
section
1827,
which
it
calls
it
then
has
a
subsection
that
says
that
"the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
court
has
to
establish
a
program
to
facilitate
the
use
of
interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i'm
sorry,
this
is
the
red
brief,
1a
of
the
appendix,
which
is
the
very
beginning
of
the
court
interpreters
act.
and
then
there's
subsection
(c),
flipping
over
to
the
next
page
--
i'm
sorry,
subsection
(b)
--
which
says
that
"the
director
has
to
certify
interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
so
what
it
does
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute
is
establish
this
thing
called
a
certified
interpreter
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
when
it
thereafter
speaks
of
interpreter
simply,
that's
just
a
shorthand
for
a
certified
interpreter
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
as
far
as
the
court
interpreters
act
is
concerned,
even
if
it's
true
that
section
2
uses
the
term
in
the
narrower
sense,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
it's
used
in
the
narrower
sense
in
section
7.
and
the
only
point
i
would
add
about
that,
as
we
set
--
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
really
not
clear
that
section
2
is
limited
to
oral
translators.
soon
after
the
court
interpreters
act
was
enacted,
and
for
approximately
16
years
thereafter,
the
administrative
office
would
publish
these
notices
in
the
federal
register
notifying
the
public
that
they
were
--
there
were
going
to
be
certification
exams
for
interpreters
under
section
2
of
the
court
interpreters
act.
these
were
pretty
streamlined
notices,
not
long
at
all.
and
one
of
the
main
aspects,
the
main
sections
of
the
notice,
was
a
list
of
what
the
director
of
the
administrative
office
said
were
the
--
were
the
duties
of
interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
and
to
be
sure,
it
listed
simultaneous
and
consecutive
interpreting,
but
it
--
it
listed
sight
translation
and
it
listed
document
translation.
so
at
a
minimum,
section
2
is
not
sufficiently
clearly
limited
to
oral
translators,
that
the
director
of
the
administrative
office
couldn't
issue
these
notices
saying
otherwise.
i
guess
the
--
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
about
other
statutes,
some
of
which
use
the
term
"interpreter"
and
"translator"
together,
i
have
already
addressed
that
in
part
by
saying
that
in
many
of
those
statutes,
it
really
is
pretty
clearly
used
in
the
narrower
sense,
because
you're
talking
about
members
of
a
profession.
the
--
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say
about
that
is
that
the
premise
of
taniguchi's
reliance
on
those
statutes
seems
to
be
that
it
would
be
strangely
redundant
for
congress
to
speak
in
other
statutes
about
interpreters
and
translators
together,
if,
in
fact,
the
two
terms
could
be
used
interchangeably,
and
that
redundancy
should
be
avoided.
but
subsection
(6)
of
1920
itself
has
a
redundancy
in
it,
because
it
covers
both
interpreters
and
special
interpretation
services.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
could
dispute
that
anyone
who
carries
out
a
special
interpretation
service
is
an
interpreter.
so
it's
not
at
all
odd
to
have
redundancy
when
congress
is
addressing
the
subject
of
translation.
