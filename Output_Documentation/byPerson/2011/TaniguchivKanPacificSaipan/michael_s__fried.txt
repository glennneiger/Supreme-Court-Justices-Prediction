mr.
michael
s.
fried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it--
please
the
court:
our
brief
licks
--
lists
six
categories
of
authority
demonstrating
that
the
work
of
an
interpreter
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1920(6)
is
limited
to
spoken
communication.
primary
among
these
is
the
court
interpreters
act
itself,
whose
central
provisions
afford
simultaneous
or
consecutive
spoken
interpreter
services.
when--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
it's
a
--
that
there
is
a
textual
ambiguity
in
the
statute
about
the
extent
of
covered
spoken
interpreter
services.
one
could
argue
it
either
way,
and
we
don't
--
i
am
happy
to
proceed
under
either
assumption.
but
what
is
clear
is
that,
however
far
it
extends
within
the
area
of
spoken
interpretation,
document
translation
is--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--court-appointed
experts,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
that
seems
to
indicate
that
that
provision
was
actually
inserted
into
1920(6)
for
a
separate
housekeeping
reason,
because
it
parallels
rule
706
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
was
a
preexisting
rule
addressing
court-appointed
experts,
and
simply
put
it
into
the
enumeration.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
that
may
well
be
the
case.
but
i
--
i
think
that
the--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--of
course.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--your
honor,
i
think
the
primary
reason
why
the
court
should
--
should
not
adopt
that
is
because
it's
--
it's
inconsistent
with
the
text.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
and
it's
also
worth
noting
that
the
courts
--
none
of
the
courts
of
appeals
who
have
adopted
this
construction
of
1920(6)
have
considered
or
addressed
our
primary
arguments
in
this
case.
they
haven't
addressed
the
uniform
professional
literature
addressing
this
--
this
topic,
the
dictionaries
in
their
aggregate,
the
administrative
office's
interpretation
of
this
statute,
the
consistent
congressional
distinction
between
written
translation
and
spoken
--
spoken
interpretation
that
runs
throughout
the
code.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
a
--
a
good
answer
to
that.
i
--
perhaps
that
they
weren't
presented
with
some
of
these
--
these
arguments
and
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
them.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
that
kan
pacific
disputes
very
little
of
--
of
our
central
argument.
their
discussion--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
again,
the
--
the
best
reason
to
reject
that
view
is
because
it
doesn't
make
a
coherent
whole
of
this
statute.
these
provisions
operate
together
in
a
uniform
set
of
--
as
a
uniform
set
of
policies
for
addressing
a
common
subject.
and
the
way
they
--
these
provisions
interact
in
broad
strokes
that
makes
perfect
sense
in
our
reading
is
that
in
the
--
in
the
primary
class
of
cases
that
motivated
the
passage
of
this
statute,
namely
cases
brought
by
the
government
where
there
were
significant
constitutional
confrontation
clause
concerns
about
criminal
defendants
not
understanding
the
spoken
proceedings,
in
those
core
class
of
cases
the
congress
elected
to
pay
for
spoken
interpreter
services
directly
in
the
first
instance.
now,
in
the
non-core
class
of
cases
litigation,
private
civil
litigation,
the
congress
elected
not
to
pay
for
these
services,
but
in
1920(6)
to
facilitate
them
in
the
lesser
manner
of
providing
that
a
party
that
incurred
these
expenses
could
recover
them
at
the
end
of
the
case
if
it
won.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
justice
breyer,
there
was
actually
a
specific
provision
in
this
bill,
in
a
prior
version
of
this
bill
that
addressed
the
context
of
puerto
rico.
and
the
significance
of
that
provision
is
that
when
the
congress
was
addressing
written
translation,
which
was
part
of
the
--
part
of
that
provision,
it
specifically
used
the
word
"translation"
to
refer
to
that.
and
this
just,
again,
confirms
that
the
usual
congressional
practice
of
differentiating
between
these
terms
in
--
in
statutes
generally
was
fully
applicable
here,
that
the
congress
knew
the
difference
between
these
terms,
used
them
appropriately,
and
the
fact
that
having
removed
that
--
that
provision
from
the
statute,
the
statute
as
passed
contains
only
the
words
"interpreter"
and
"interpretation",
and
no
forms
of
"translate"
just
again
reaffirms
that
--
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
these
terms
should
apply.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
your
honor,
the
professional
literature
addresses
this
as
sight
interpretation
or
sight
translation,
and
it's
uniformly
recognized
to
be
a
species
of
interpretation.
it
occurs
--
the
--
the
interpreter
speaks
aloud
in
the
presence
of
the
audience
being
communicated
to
in
the
course
of
a
spoken
proceeding.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
preparatory
work
that
occurred
outside
of
court
would
not
be
compensable
interpretation
work.
but
when
the
--
when
the
interpreter
returned
to
court
and
gave
the
oral
interpretation
of
that
document,
that
would
constitute
interpretation.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
key
reason
why
that
would
constitute
interpretation
is
because
the
--
the
interpreter
is
speaking
aloud,
communicating
in
the
course
of
a
spoken
conversation
to
an
audience
who
--
who
doesn't
speak
english
or--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--perhaps
i
did,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
literature
does
typically
class
the
in-court
oral
communication
of
its
content
as
a
form
of
interpretation.
but
any
ambiguity
on
this
point
really
--
really
doesn't
--
doesn't
affect
anything
in
practice.
i
mean,
any
sight
interpretation
occurs
as
a
brief
interval
in
a
larger
proceeding.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
yes.
i
think
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
"translate"
applies
to
the
context
of
--
the
communication
of
information
in
written
documents.
and
it's
--
it's
discrete
from
"interpretation",
which
--
which
is
limited
to--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i
apologize,
your
honor.
yes,
you
can
use
the
word
"translate"
generically.
there's
no
question.
frequently
in
court,
and
i
think
out
of
court
as
well,
that
some
people
can
use
the
word
"translate"
in
a
manner
that
doesn't
differentiate
between
modes.
our
point
is
that
--
that
double
meaning
doesn't
apply
to
"interpreter",
which
has
a
single
narrow
meaning
limited
to
spoken
communication.
and
kan
pacific's
discussion
of
the
dictionaries
is
limited
to
a
single
dictionary,
webster's
third.
the
majority
of
dictionaries
categorically
exclude
document
translation
from
the
scope
of--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--it
does,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--well,
the
court
in
the
--
in
the
mci
v.
at&t
case
did
indicate
that.
but
--
but
in
any
event,
the
--
on
its
terms,
that
definition
supports
our
reading
over
kan
pacific's
because
it
does
indicate,
even
as
to
that
dictionary
definition,
that
the
most
common
meaning
of
the
term
is
the
meaning
referring
to
spoken
communications.
and
this
court
frequently
looks
to
the
most
common
meaning
for
purposes
of
statutory
interpretation,
as
it
did
in
mallard
in
construing
the
word
"request",
and
in
ramsey
in
construing
the
word
"envelope".
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i
can
talk
--
there's
a
--
the
text
does.
the
--
the
text--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--i'm
not
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
an
explicit
statement
that
i'm
aware
of
in
the
legislative
history.
there's
a
lot
of
provisions
in
the
legislative
history
which
plainly
presuppose
that.
and
the
congress
received
professional
literature
from
--
documents
from
the
american
association
of
language
specialists.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
specifically
with
respect
to
costs,
the
congress
--
the
house
report
alludes
to
rule
43(f),
which
is
now
43(d),
as
a
relevant
preexisting
rule.
and
of
course,
it's
undisputed
that
rule
43(d)'s
cost
provision
is
--
is
limited
to
spoken
communication
of
interpreters.
so
there
is
that
in
the
history
as
well.
but
--
but
i
think
that
there's
no
doubt
that
under
the
text
of
the
statute,
subsection
(k)
the
modes
subsection,
which
appears
at
page
5a
of
the
red
brief
appendix
as
it
was
initially
passed,
expressly
says
that
the
interpretation
under
--
under
this
section
must
be
done
by
using
methods
that
all
agree
are
limited
to
spoken
communication.
now,
in
the--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
no,
your
honor.
that
would
not
constitute
interpreting,
because
it
would
not
--
the
interpreter
would
not
be
communicating
between
live
parties
in
the
context
of
a
real-time
proceeding.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
yes,
your
honor,
because
in
the
courtroom,
in
the
context
of
a
live
spoken
proceeding,
that
satisfies
all
of
the
ordinary
definitional
elements
of
interpreting.
but
that's
not
the
case
in
somebody's
office
in
the
presence
of
a
single
party
and
a
written
document.
and
--
and
there's
no
question,
your
honor,
that
to
the
extent
there's
any
ambiguity
with
respect
to
unusual
examples,
this
is
a
distinction
that's
absolutely
clear
in
the
vast
majority
of
real
world
incidents.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
i
do
think
there
--
one
could
potentially
argue
that
spoken
interpretation
at
a
deposition
isn't
covered,
in
light
of
some
of
the
dictionaries
like
black's
law
dictionary,
which
indicates
that
the
word
is
restricted
to
people
who
work
in
trial.
but
i
certainly
think
that
it
could
be
argued
either
way,
in
a
case
where--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--i'm
not
sure
we
have
a
definitive
--
i
think
you
could
argue
it
either
way,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
affect
our
case.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i
think
there's
a
reasonable
reading
that
that
should
be
covered.
i
think
that's
certainly
--
we
have
no
vested
interest
in
opposing
that.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
your
honor,
that
sort
of
discretion
demonstrably
does
not
prevent
the
issuance
of
these
large
awards,
because
there
have
been
a
number
of
large
awards
issued
notwithstanding
that
discretion.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
the
--
the
district
courts--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--that's
the
way
it
works,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
discretion
is
sufficient
to
eliminate
the
deterrent
effect
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
farmer
and
fleischmann,
because
it
occurs
at
the
end
of
the
case,
after
a
litigant
has
already
decided
whether
to
bring
suit.
the
deterrent
effect
occurs
ex
ante
when
a
risk-averse
litigant
has
to
decide
whether
to
bring
the
case.
but
i
--
i
would
just
note
that
these
sorts
of
policy
questions,
your
honor,
arise
in
the
context
of
language
that
by
its
terms
extends
to
interpreting
and
not
translating.
and
we
would
say
that
the
relevant
policy
question
is
simply
whether
there
are
sensible
reasons
to
--
that
congress
may
have
drawn
a
line
where
it
did.
and
plainly,
there
are
adequate
reasons
that
these
services,
document
translation
services
that
were
excluded,
are
potentially
large
and
fall
under
the
general
principles
that
this
court
has
recognized
are
--
are
presumptively
not
frequently
avoided--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--certainly,
your
honor.
as
to
the
difference,
i
mean,
i'm
not
aware
of
--
under
this
statute,
an
interpreter's
spoken
interpretation
award
approaching
anywhere
near
some
of
the
larger
document
translation
awards
that
have
been
issued.
but
nonetheless,
i
am
not
denying
that
there
could
be
large
interpreter
awards
in
some
cases.
but
the
fact
is
that
adding
on
document
translation
awards
is
additive.
the
sort
of
necessity
review
that
would
be
necessary
to
police
these
document
translation
awards
would
be
quite
burdensome
on
the
district
courts.
and
in
fact,
the
necessity
standard
is
actually
particularly
problematic
to
apply
to
translations,
your
honor.
because
the
fact
is
you
don't
know
what
a
document
says
until
it
has
been
translated.
and
the
exercise
of
trying
to
go
back
and
reconstruct
ex
ante
what
a
--
whether
a
person
was
reasonably
necessary
in
causing
to
be
translated
something
that
they
didn't
know
what
it
meant
is
likely
to
lead
to
very
subjective--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--your
honor,
i
am
not
at
all
suggesting
that
there
has
been
a
tremendous
financial
strain
on
the
system.
we
are
saying
that
this
is
a
statute
that,
by
its
plain
language,
extends
to--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
actually,
i
didn't
hear
the
end
of
your
question.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
the
great
bulk.
i
mean,
there's
been
a
significant
disagreement--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
that
it's
increased
over
time.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
pinpoint
a
date,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
i
will
have
to
find
out
while
my
adversary
is
arguing
what
the
first
decision
was.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
certainly
it
wasn't
construing
1920(6)
at
that
time,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
your
honor--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--certainly,
your
honor.
um,
addressing--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--1978,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
we
agree.
and
the
structural
reasons
are
--
within
the
court
interpreters
act
itself
are
every
bit
as
powerful
as
the
ordinary
textual
indicia
that
support
our
reading.
and
in
fact
kan
pacific's
argument
that
the
word
"interpreters"
should
be
assigned
different
meanings
in
different
parts
of
the
statute
is
--
is
unsupported.
kan
pacific
relies
on
what
it
characterizes
as
different
language
in
section
2,
which
put
in
1827
and
1828,
and
section
7,
which
put
in
the
cost
provision.
and
it
notes
that
section
2
sometimes
uses
the
broader
phrase
"interpreters
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
whereas
section
7
uses
the
word
"interpreters"
alone.
but
kan
pacific
doesn't
examine
the
context
in
which
section
2
does
and
does
not
use
that
broader
phrase.
and
those
specifics
really
undermine
any
argument
one
might
make
along
those
lines.
as
originally
passed
in
section
2,
1827
contains
26
occurrences
of
the
word
"interpreter",
not
counting
the
title.
and
of
those
26
cases,
24
simply
use
the
word
"interpreter"
by
itself.
so
there
is
certainly
at
the
very
threshold
no
overarching
pattern
of
usage
distinction
between
them.
more
fundamentally,
though,
the
substantive
provisions
addressing
the
use
of
interpreters
by
parties
in
these
cases
in
1827
do
so
without
using
that
broader
phrase.
subsection
(d)--
mr.
michael
s.
fried
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
without
using
the
broader
phrase
"in
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
subsection
(d)
is
the
provision
that
--
that
governs
the
use
of
interpreters
in
cases
brought
by
the
government.
this
appears
at
page
2a
of
the
red
brief
appendix,
and
it
simply
provides
that
upon
a
determination
of
need,
the
services
of
an
interpreter
will
be
used
in
these
cases.
the
only
two
provisions
that
use
the
phrase
"interpreters
in
courts
to
the
united
states.
"
are
subsections
(a)
and
(b),
which
are
both
at
1a
of
the
red
brief
appendix,
and
both
of
these
provisions
--
are
addressing
the
scope
of
the
administrative
office's
duties
under
the
statute.
and
as
such,
it
simply
makes
clear
that,
in
keeping
with
the
office's
ordinary
function,
it's
--
it's
facilitating
the
work
of
the
federal
courts
and
making
clear
that
the
offices
--
and,
for
instance,
certifying
interpreters
for
the
state
courts.
so
nothing
in
this
language
suggests
in
any
way
that
the
--
that
the
word
"interpreter"
means
something
different
in
different
places
or
that
the
services
of
an
interpreter
are
viewed
as
embracing
the
same
thing.
so
we
think
that
a
variety
of
indicia
of
meaning
converge
in
this
case
to
support
the
conclusion
that
1920(6)
is
limited
to
spoken
communication.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
r.
himmelfarb.
mr.
michael
s.
fried
very
briefly,
your
honor,
three
points.
in
the
first
place,
justice
breyer,
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
the
first
decision
--
first
appellate
decision
construing
1920(6)
to
encompass
document
translation
was
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
lam
quy
in
1981.
second,
mr.
himmelfarb
noted
that
black's
law
dictionary
takes
a
definition
that
arguably
could
encompass
document
translation,
but
he
didn't
mention
that
the
operative
version
of
black's
in
1978
when
this
statute
was
passed
did
not
--
was
a
different
definition
that
excluded
document
translation.
and
this
change
in
the
definition
occurred
in
1999,
in
the
seventh
edition,
after
a
number
of
these
judicial
decisions
construing
1920(6)
had
come
down,
which
supports
your
honor's
observation
that
it
could
very
well
merely
reflect
a
recognition
of
these
decisions,
rather
than
independent
support
for
them.
finally,
your
honors,
mr.
himmelfarb
cited
certain
notices
issued
by
the
administrative
office
from
many
years
ago.
these
brief
notices
were
ministerial
documents
that
simply
announced
a
forthcoming
examination.
the
office
has
issued
the
guidance
to
judiciary
policy,
which
is
--
which
is
the
fully
expressed
views
on
this
issue.
and
it's
posted
on
the
office's
website.
it's
current
as
of
june
9,
2011
--
and
expressly
provides
that
document
translation
is
not
a
part
of
the
statutory
services
of
an
interpreter.
if
there
are
further
questions,
i'd
be
happy
to
address
them.
