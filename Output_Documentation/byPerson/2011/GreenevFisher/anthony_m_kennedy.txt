justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
--
let
me
ask
it.
there
was
a
second
half
of
the
chief
justice's
question
that
you
never
got
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
since
we
are
on--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
gvr,
i
have
one
more
question
under
the
gvr,
at
least.
if
you
had
sought
--
if
you
had
been
counsel,
you're
not
--
if
you
had
been
greene's
counsel
and
you
had
sought
cert
from
this
court,
you
would
have
sought
cert
to
the
supreme
--
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania,
to
the
intermediate
court,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
indicates
that
that
is
the
decision
that's
--
that's
involved
here.
and
once
that
decision
becomes
final,
then
you
have
a
problem.
if
--
if
--
if
the
protocol
or
the
practice
or
the
rules
had
been
that
you
would
seek
cert
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
then
you
might
have
had
an
argument
about
finality,
but
now
you
don't.
but
you
can
get
to
that
later,
because
the
--
the
chief
justice
had
a
second
part
of
his
question
which
was
collateral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
just
to
follow
up
on
that
question,
the
statute
says
it
was
"adjudicated",
past
tense,
and
the
decision
"resulted
in",
past
tense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
you
said
--
you
don't
contend
that
--
what's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
said
you
don't
contend
that,
and
i
didn't
hear
--
was
an
unreasonable?
i
just
didn't
hear
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
and
of
course
those
are
ongoing
injuries
where
the
person
continues
to
be
confined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
there
is
an
ongoing
injury
here.
all
we
are
doing
is
talking
about
a
trial
error.
that's
--
that's
different
than--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
that
cause
and
prejudice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
actual
innocence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
griff
constitutional
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
the
authority
looking
at
this
case
to
direct
federal
courts
to
issue
habeas
in
this
--
on
these
facts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
is
that
then
a
restriction
on
habeas
corpus?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
rule
of
constitutional
avoidance
that
we
should
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid?
any
inference
that
there
is
a
restriction
on
habeas
corpus?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
that's
not
argued.
i
agree.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
while
we
are
discussing
--
on
a
different
point.
what
response
do
you
make
to
mr.
fisher's
point
about
graham
and
roper
v.
simmons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
meet
the
teague
exception?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
me
it's
not
a
question
of
a
new
trial.
it's
a
question
of
looking
at
a
continuing
sentence
and
seeing
validity
of
a
continuing
sentence.
