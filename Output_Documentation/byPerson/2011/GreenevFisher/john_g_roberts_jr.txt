chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-637,
greene
v.
fisher.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem,
at
least
not
in
this
case,
if
your
client
had
--
had
sought
cert,
right?
because
then
presumably
when
his
petition
came
before
the
court,
our
normal
practice
would
have
been
to
gvr
it,
because
the
decision
would
come
out
the
other
way
under
--
under
gray,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
if
he
had
sought
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
can't
very
well
gvr
it
until
he
seeks
cert.--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
i
think
it's
kind
of
a
glaring
factual
nuance
to
the
case,
kind
of,
that
he
didn't
seek
cert.
and
he
also
didn't
seek
state
collateral
review.
i
mean,
if
he
had
tried
one
of
those
or
both
of
those,
we
--
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
normally
i
think
if
it
looks
like
a
mess
procedurally,
or
whatever,
the
normal
assumption
is
you
let
the
lower
court
figure
it
out.
send
it
back,
and
i
--
i
think
the
research
is
that
in
actually
most
cases
in
which
we
gvr,
the
court
reinstates
the
judgment
below
for
one
reason
or
--
or
another;
but
the
idea
that
we
parse
through
them
carefully
--
i
think
if
it's
arguable,
send
it
back
and
let
the
lower
court
sort
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
appreciate
your
point
that
you
may
or
may
not
have
been
able
to
bring
it.
my
--
my
concern
is
that
you
have,
i
guess
as
someone
put
it,
the
perfect
storm
here.
you
have
a
person
who
did
not
file
cert,
and
he
could
well
have
gotten
relief
if
he
had,
through
the
gvr
process,
and
who
did
not
seek
state
collateral
review,
and
he
could
well
have
--
you
say
probably
wouldn't.
but
the
state
said
certainly
would
have.
somewhere
in
there.
at
least
he
would
have
had
a
fair
chance--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
a
chance.
but
because
he
didn't
seek
cert
and
he
didn't
file
state
collateral
relief,
we
have
this
more
complicated
scenario.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
aedpa
contemplates
that.
it
refers
to
any
claim
that
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court
proceedings.
so
naturally
you
would
have
a
different
result
with
respect
to
claims
that
were
adjudicated
on
direct
review
and
any
claim
that
was
pushed
over
to
collateral
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
but
i
mean,
my
point
is
that
it
seems
a
pretty
weak
criticism
of
a
result
that
it
requires
you
to
go
claim
by
claim,
when
the
statute
specifically
requires
you
to
go
claim
by
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
objection
there
it
seems
to
me
would
have
to
be
with
congress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
eisenberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
your
pinholster
point.
your
friend
makes
the
argument
that
of
course
in
a
typical
appellate
case,
you
don't
go
back
and
revisit
the
facts,
but
that
appellate
court
is
expected
to
apply
the
law
at
the
time
it
renders
its
decision.
so
there
is
that
distinction
between
law
and
facts
that
seems
to
cut
in
his
favor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
more
generally,
the
idea
that
pinholster
adequately
applies
to
this
situation.
it
applies
to
facts,
therefore
it
applies
to
law.
the
distinction
in
that
context
between
law
and
facts,
the
general
context
strikes
me
as
one
that
supports
his
argument
that
there
are
at
least
not
tied
at
the
hip
and
have
to
be
treated
the
same
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
state
hypothetical,
and
i
don't
mean
to
give
you
an
opportunity
for
a
self-serving
answer,
but
would
the
state
have
done
if
he
filed
a
petition
and
said:
my
case
was
controlled
by
gray;
you
the
supreme
court
should
grant,
vacate
and
remand.
are
you
aware
of
situations
where
the
state
has
agreed
with
such
a
request?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
your
office's
position
in
responding
to
a
petition
for
cert.
have
you
ever
said:
yes,
gray
controls,
that's
different,
you,
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
the
first
opinion
of
the
term
in
an
argued
case
this
year
from
justice
scalia
in
greene
versus
fisher.
