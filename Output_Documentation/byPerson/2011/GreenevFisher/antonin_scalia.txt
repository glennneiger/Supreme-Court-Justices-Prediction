justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
the
decision
--
what
decision
did
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
make
other
than
the
decision
not
to
hear
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
december
of
1993,
the
petitioner
eric
greene
and
four
coconspirators
robbed
a
grocery
store
and
killed
the
store's
owner.
after
a
joint
trial,
a
jury
convicted
greene
of
second-degree
murder,
robbery,
and
conspiracy.
greene
appealed
arguing
that
the
introduction
of
his
codefendants'
redacted
confessions
during
trial,
violated
his
rights
under
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
--
superior
court
upheld
the
conviction,
rejecting
greene's
confrontation
clause
claim
on
the
merits.
greene
petitioned
for
allowance
of
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
while
that
petition
was
pending,
we
decided
a
case
called
gray
versus
maryland,
which
strongly
supported
greene's
confrontation
clause
claim.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
declined
to
hear
greene's
appeal,
however,
and
greene
did
not
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
this
court.
instead,
he
filed
the
present
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
district
court,
asserting
the
same
confrontation
clause
claim.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996,
which
we
call
aedpa.
aedpa
prohibits
a
federal
court
from
granting
habeas
relief
to
a
state
prisoner
on
any
claim
that
has
been
"adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court
proceedings,"
unless
that
adjudication
"resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary
to
or
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states."
the
district
court
concluded
that
our
decision
in
gray
was
--
was
not
yet
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
pennsylvania
superior
court's
adjudication,
the
adjudication
of
the
intermediate
court,
and
the
condition
for
gray
for
granting
habeas
relief
had
therefore
not
been
met.
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
we
hold
that
under
aedpa
"clearly
established
federal
laws
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states"
includes
only
this
court's
decisions
as
of
the
time
of
the
relevant
state
court
adjudication
on
the
merits.
as
we
explained
last
term
in
cullen
versus
pinholster
aedpa's,
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
case,
aedpa's
backward
looking
language
requires
an
examination
of
the
state
court
decision
at
the
time
it
was
made.
in
conducting
that
examination
the
federal
courts
may
measure
state
court
decisions
only
against
supreme
court
precedents
that
existed
when
the
state
court
ruled.
any
other
approach
would
permit
the
federal
courts
to
evaluate
state
court
decisions
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
which
as
cullen
established,
aedpa
does
not
permit.
and
contrary
to
greene's
contentions,
this
court's
decision
in
teague
versus
lane
does
not
suggest
a
different
result.
i
might
add
and
the
opinion
adds
that
the
--
in
--
in
a
way
the
petitioner
here
was
--
was
the
architect
of
--
of
his
own
difficulty.
he
could
have
sought
certiorari
from
this
court
and
under
our
usual
practice
because
of
the
intervening
supreme
court
decision
in
--
in
gray,
we
almost
certainly
would
have
granted
the
petition
and
vacated
--
vacated
the
judgment
and
remanded
for
consideration
by
the
pennsylvania
courts
in
the
light
of
gray.
he
didn't
do
that.
he
went
right
to
federal
habeas
and
aedpa
does
not
permit
federal
habeas
to
be
granted
on
these
grounds.
because
the
last
state
court
adjudication
on
the
merits
was
neither
contrary
to,
nor
involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
existed
at
the
time
aedpa
bars
the
federal
courts
from
granting
greene's
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
