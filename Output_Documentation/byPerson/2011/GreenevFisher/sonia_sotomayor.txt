how
do
you
get
past
horn?
horn
says
that
--
that
teague
and
aedpa
are
two
different
analyses
that
each
case
must
undergo.
that
you
start
with,
okay,
what
does
teague
say,
but
you
then
look
at
what
aedpa
says,
and
that
each
can
serve
as
an
independent
bar.
so
if
that's
the
case,
how
do
you
get
around
aedpa's
requirement
of
a
past-looking
statute
being
one
that
involves
the
adjudication,
and
whether
at
its
time,
it
was
contrary
to
supreme
court
precedent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
part
of
your
argument
that
--
one
part
of
your
argument
that
troubles
me
is
what
if
those
12
states
that
don't
have
the
right
to
collateral
review
--
what
do
we
do
with
the
two
teague
exceptions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
worry
about
the
states
that
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
asked
--
my
hypothetical
was
assuming
there
are
some
that
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
haven't
decided
whether
actual
innocence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whether
it's
well
established
is
another
issue.
