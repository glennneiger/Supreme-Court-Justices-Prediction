mr.
ronald
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
every
relevant
word
in
the
statute
and
every
relevant
precedent
to
this
court
points
to
the
same
place,
to
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
decision.
that's
the
body
of
law
that
must
be
used
in
deference
analysis.
now--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
as
we
addressed
in
our
brief
at
footnote
12,
as
petitioner
referred,
we
believe
that
teague
exceptions
clearly
would
survive
review.
the
reason
for
that
is
really
a
two-step
process.
number
one,
in
most
states
--
and
perhaps
hypothetically
there
will
be
somewhere
where
this
isn't
true,
but
petitioner
hasn't
identified
--
has
identified
no
more
than
two
that
i
can
see
in
its
brief.
in
most
states
the
defendant
will
receive
review
of
the
teague
exception
on
state
collateral
review.
we
want
him
--
aedpa
calls
on
him--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--okay.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
of
course,
justice
sotomayor.
as
to
those
relatively
few
states
that
hypothetically
might
not,
the
defendant
goes
to
federal
court
and,
because
this
is
a
teague
exception
--
and
they
are
exceptions
because
they
are
exceptional.
he
has
a
number
of
existing
habeas
doctrines
to
rely
on:
causing
prejudice,
actual
innocence,
inadequate
state
grounds.
and
he
is
quite
likely
in
the
teague
exception
case
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
default
of
not
having
had
an
adjudication
in
state
court
and
he
will
have
not
only
review
in
federal
court,
but
he
will
have
de
novo
review
in
federal
court,
because
there
was
no
ruling
on
the
merits.
so
not
only
will
he
have
federal
court
review,
but
it
won't
be
deferential
review
in
that
circumstance.
if
the
state
did
allow
the
review
of
the
teague
exception,
then
he
will
have
deferential
review.
and
in
fact
this
question
has
been
debate
by
the
court
before.
it
came
up
in
oral
argument
in
whorton
v.
bockting.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
that
case
actually
addressed
the
question
empirically,
looked
at
ome
of
the
most
recent
candidates
for
first
teague
exception
status
which
was
the
mental
retardation
rule
of
adkins
v.
virginia,
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
found
that
no
state
had
barred
review
of
the
adkins
claim
even
though
it
was
not
even
officially
declared
yet
to
be
a
teague
exception.
we
think
that
is
what
would
happen
with
these
exceptions.
of
course,
this
case
doesn't
concern
a
teague
exception
and
so
really
the
only
question
here
is
whether
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
state
would
inadvertently
determine
that
question
for
future
purposes.
i
think
our
argument
is
adequate
at
least
to
show
that
the
question
remains
why
it
can
be
safely
left
for
another
day.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
if
they
didn't,
your
honor,
then
the
defendant
can
surmount
whatever
procedural
bar
that
would
constitute
when
he
got
the
federal
habeas
in
the
teague
exception
case.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
by
arguing
--
the
most
likely
teague
exception
would
be
a
first
exception;
not
the
second
exception;
not
the
watershed
rules
which
are
few
and
far
between
if
any
still
remain
to
be
discovered.
that
exception
fits
very
neatly
with
the
actual
innocence--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--actual
innocence.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
actual
innocence
because--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--actual
innocence,
your
honor,
is
well
established
as
a
way
to
get
around
a
procedural
default
on
federal
habeas.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
i
don't
mean
actual
innocence
as
being
an
independent
free-standing
habeas
claim.
i
mean
as
a
gateway
to
merits
review.
that
is
well
established.
and
the
first
teague
exception
by
definition
deals
with
people
who
essentially
didn't
commit
the
crime.
the
nature
of
the
exception
is
that
the
state
did
not
have
the
constitutional
power
to
make
that
a
crime.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
that
would
be
the
watershed
exception
rule,
your
honor.
again
i
believe
that
the
states
would
generally
and
have
empirically
entertained
those
claims.
if
the
state
did
not
--
i
believe
if
the
defendant
would
have
the
right
to
say
that
because
of
the
watershed
nature
of
the
rule,
the
state's
failure
to
entertain
the
claim
was
an
inadequate
state
ground
for
blocking
review
in
federal
court.
and
i
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
application
of
the
doctrine.
i
think
as
justice
kagan
stated
earlier,
or
suggested
by
her
question,
pinholster
really
does
resolve
this
claim,
even
in
addition
to
the
language
of
the
case.
petitioner
argues
the
facts
in
law
are
different.
and
they
might
be
to
some
extent
but
actually
law
is
an
easier
question
for
the
issue
that
is
presented
here.
and
pinholster
did
not
simply
tell
us
that
new
facts
couldn't
be
considered,
but
the
premise
of
the
decision
was
that
since
new
law
couldn't
be
decided,
neither
could
new
facts.
the
statute
is
phrased
in
the
past
tense.
as
the
court
said,
the
entire
statute
is
backward
looking.
there
was
no
--
nothing
about
the
statute--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
your
honor,
the
only
decision
that
was
rendered
in
this
case
did
apply
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
i
think
that
pinholster
was
somewhat
more
specific
than
that.
it
stated
that
--
the
statute
was
backwards
looking
in
its
entirety,
certainly
with
no
exceptions
for
law.
after
all,
(d)1
is
about
law.
it
doesn't
mention
the
word
facts
or
evidence;
it
mentions
only
the
word
"law".
and
the
court
had
to
move
from
that
to
its
decision
about
facts.
number
2,
in
pinholster
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
was
relying
on
prior
precedence.
and
it
used
the
word
"precedent"
to
describe
the
prior
decision.
for
the
proposition
that
our
case
has
emphasized
that
review
under
2254(d)1
focuses
on
what
a
state
court
knew
and
did.
state
court
decisions
are
measured
against
this
court's
precedent
as
of
the
time
the
state
court
renders
its
decision.
the
jumping
off
point,
so
to
speak,
for
the
court's
extension
of
the
principle
the
effect
that
we
are
debating
today
to
the
area
of
new
facts.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
way
to
reconcile
that
holding
with
the
petitioner's
argument
or
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
now
the
petitioner
argues
that
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
the
defendant
his
rights
under
griffith
v.
kentucky.
but
as
i
think
the
chief
justice's
questions
illustrate,
he
had
those
rights.
he
was
entitled
to
seek
review
on
direct
appeal
as
long
as
it
lasted
of
whatever
new
rules
came
out
before
the
point
of
finality.
he
was
entitled
to
seek
discretionary
review
in
the
state
supreme
court.
he
was
entitled
to
seek
discretionary
review
in
this
court.
had
he
done
so,
i
think--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
think
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
in
which
the
state
court
has
granted,
vacated,
and
remanded.
i
know
that
petitioner
said
that--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
not
sure
i
have
seen
any
cases
like
that
other
than
this
one
where
this
as
you
said
perfect
storm
actually
occurred.
in
this
case
that's
not
what
we
said,
and
that's
because
we
thought
that
there
had
been
an
affirmative
abandonment
of
the
method
of
redaction
claim
by
defendant.
but
if
the
state
court
as
it
did
here
decides
not
to
grant
review,
then
of
course
the
defendant
is
free
to
come
to
this
court.
the
point
is
that
under
griffith
the
defendant
obviously
doesn't
have
any
more
of
a
right
than
to
go
to
the
courts
that
are
up
the
chain,
and
which
at
a
certain
point
exercises
discretionary
review.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
a
constitutional
interpretation,
but
that's
a
right
that
the
defendant
has.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
i
think
that
the
congress
could
have
written
the
aedpa
in
order
to
allow
review
here.
but
i
don't
think
that
they
did.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
i
think
that
aedpa
puts
a
restriction
on
habeas
corporation,
your
honor.
and
in
most
cases,
in
most
aspects
of
aedpa
put
far
more
of
a
restriction
than
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
clear
from
prior
case
law
that
the
aedpa
does
not
constitute
an
unconstitutional
restriction
of
habeas.
the
defendant
here
does
not
argue
that
the
restriction--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--and
i
think
it
is
clearly
not
--
this
is
a
relatively
minor
restriction
on
aedpa
review
compared
to
the
deference
rule
in
and
of
itself,
which
the
court
has
characterized
as
a
fundamental
bedrock
principle
of
aedpa.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
if
those
kinds
of
cases
amount
to
a
teague
exception,
then
for
the
reasons
i
have
explained
i
think
that
those
will
be
subject
to
review
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
if
they
are
not,
if
they
don't
need
to--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
any
particular
new
rule
meets
the
teague
exception
standards.
those
are
high
standards
and
they
should
be.
they
are
exceptional.
but
for
the
normal
new
rule--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i
think
there
are
certainly
good
arguments
that
those
kinds
of
rules
would
not
qualify
as
teague
exceptions,
your
honor.
it's
going
to
be
a
rare
circumstance.
and
as
i
said
the
only
one
that
even
arguably
in
recent
years
would
seem
to
fit
well
into
the
first
teague
exception,
that
is
the
adkins
case,
the
state
courts
have
allowed
review.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
defendant
should
go
first
to
the
state
court
once
the
new
teague
exception
is
established,
your
honor.
and
if
he
doesn't,
if
he
goes
to
federal
court
first--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
then
i
think
we
have
justice
sotomayor's
question,
your
honor.
and
the
answer
is
that
in
that
case
the
defendant
can
argue
that
the
state's
failure
to
provide
review
constituted
a
bar
that
he
is
allowed
to
circumvent
by
the
existing
doctrine
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
appropriate
because
of
course
aedpa
wants
the
state
court
to
have
the
first
chance
to
review.
if
the
state
court
refuses
to
do
so,
then
he
can
circumvent
the
bar.
if
the
state
court
does
so,
then
the
state
court's
review
on
the
merits
on
the
new
rule
becomes
the
law
that
will
be
applied,
the
clearly
established
law
that
will
be
applied.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
--
your
honors,
i
think
it's
important
also
to
remember
here
that
--
that
teague
has
not
been
abolished
by
2254,
its
role
has
certainly
been
reduced,
but
that
is
true
of
many
aspects
of
aedpa.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
what's
left
of
it
primarily,
your
honor,
is
the
situation
where
there
is
no
merits
decision
in
the
state
court.
and
we've
just
described
one
example
of
that
in
the
teague
exception
case
where
the
state
refuses
to
provide
merits
review,
but
there
will
be
many
others
where
the
state
asserts
a
default
and
the
defendant
is
able
to
overcome
them
through
cause
and
prejudice,
et
cetera.
in
those
cases
the
defendant,
for
purposes
of
2254,
wouldn't
be
barred
because
there
is
no
merits
determination.
but
teague
might
still
bar
him
if
the
new
rule
on
which
he
seeks
review
is
one
that
came
down
after
the
point
of
finality.
teague
is
not
a
guarantee
of
rights
to
the
defendant.
griffith
was
the
guarantee
of
rights
to
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
received
his
griffith
rights.
teague
is
a
bar
to
review.
aedpa
is
a
bar
to
review.
there
are
two
separate
bars
that
overlap
to
some
degree
but
work
in
different
ways.
another
example
of
a
situation
where--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
agree
with
that
factually.
in
the
spisak
case,
for
example,
i
don't
know
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
state
to
make
that
argument.
the
state
thought
it
had
a
strong
argument
on
the
merits.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
horn
v.
banks,
as
well,
your
honor,
which
is
a
case
that
actually
supports
our
position.
in
that
case,
the
state
court
applied
on
collateral
review
the
rule
of
mills
v.
maryland.
now
this
court
later
held
in
that
same
case
that
mills
was
a
new
rule
that
would
be
teague-barred,
but
the
state
didn't
know
that
at
that
time,
and
the
state
had
a
well
established
body
of
law
applying
mills.
and
thought
--
the
state
thought
it
could
reasonably
dispose
of
the
claim
on
merits
of
the
mills
issue,
so
it
did
so.
the
case
came
to
federal
habeas
corpus
review.
it
wouldn't
have
been
barred,
review
on
the
merits
would
not
have
been
barred
by
2254
because
the
state
collateral
review
court
applied
mills
and
made
a
merits
determination.
so
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
merits
review
under
the
deferential
standard.
the
problem
is
mills
was
a
new
rule
and
so
the
independent
bar
of
teague
comes
into
play.
the
third
circuit
refused
to
apply
that
independent
bar;
that's
why
this
court
reversed
in
horn
v.
banks;
and
so
it
neatly
many
illustrates
another
example
of
a
situation
where
teague
actually
does
survive
despite
2254.
there
are
other
doctrines
that,
based
on
this
court's
case
law,
that
have
been
overshadowed
to
an
even
greater
extent
than
teague
was.
abuse
of
the
writ,
the
keeney
v.
tomayo-reyes
concerning
evidentiary
hearings.
certainly
congress
had
the
right
to
do
that,
and
in
fact
these
issues
were
addressed
to
some
degree
even
in
the
court's
seminal
deference
case
in
williams
v.
taylor.
in
williams
v.
taylor
for
example,
it
was
justice
stevens'
position
in
dissent,
arguing
in
dissent,
that
the
statute
really
only
embodied
teague.
when
the
statute
said
clearly
established
all
that
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
codify
teague.
he
said
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
that
was
the
case.
and
he
argued,
particularly
in
footnote
12
of
his
dissenting
portion
of
his
opinion
in
williams
v.
taylor,
just
as
petitioner
argues
today
that
the
fact
that
congress
in
other
portions
of
aedpa,
particularly
in
section
2244,
used
language
talking
about
finality
of
judgment
and
talking
about
retroactivity,
the
fact
that
congress
did
that
in
2254
means
that
it
was
thinking
about
teague
and
that
it
really
meant
to
extend
the
teague
rule
throughout
the
entire
statute,
that
teague
really
flavored
the
entire
statute.
the
court
necessarily
rejected
that
argument,
and
in
fact
in
reference
to
another
prior
case
of
this
court,
wright
v.
west
that
had
been
argued
by
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent,
justice
o'connor
speaking
for
the
court
said:
"congress
need
not
mention
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
by
name
in
a
statute's
text
in
order
to
adopt
a
rule.
"
now
i
think
that's
clearly
what
congress
did,
and
i
think
it's
--
that
the
court
clearly
recognized
in
williams
v.
taylor
that
the
deference
rule,
2254,
constituted
a
new
rule
which
sat
side
by
side
with
teague
and
operated
in
different
ways
even
if
in
some
cases,
many
cases
that
mean
you
never
have
to
get
to
the
teague
bar,
because
the
2254-bar
came
into
play
first
or
more
easily.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
