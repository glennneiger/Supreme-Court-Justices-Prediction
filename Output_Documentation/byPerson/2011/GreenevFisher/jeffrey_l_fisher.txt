mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
any
decision
announced
from
this
court
before
a
state
prisoner's
conviction
becomes
final
constitutes
clearly
established
law
for
purposes
of
applying
section
2254(d)
of
aedpa.
for
decades,
in
fact,
it
has
been
a
bedrock
rule
under
teague
and
griffith
that
state
prisoners
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
decisions
from
this
court
that
come
down
before
finality,
and
that
rule
has
delivered
fairness
and
clarity
to
an
area
that
that
this
court
has
acknowledged
previously
lacked
it.
there
is
no
compelling
reason
to
chart
a
new
course
now.
there
is
no
doubt
that
aedpa
changed
federal
habeas
law
in
many
important
ways,
but
it
did
not
change
habeas
law
with
respect
to
retroactivity,
for
under
this
court's
teague
jurisprudence
states
already
had
comity,
as
opposed
to
other
areas.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
this
court
had
gvred
the
case
--
if
--
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
--
well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--of
course.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
let
me
take
those
one
at
a
time,
your
honor.
first
with
--
with
--
with
the
gvr
request,
if
he
had
had
counsel
that
would
have
advised
him
to
seek
cert,
he
may
well
have
done
it
and
this
court
may
have
gvred,
but
realize
that
this
court
isn't
bound
to
do
that.
this
court
has
discretionary
jurisdiction,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
wants
to
take
on
the
responsibility
of
--
of
deciding
every
single
case
that
falls
into
a
twilight
zone
situation.
you
are
going
to
have
cases,
like
this
one
very
well
would
have
in
light
of
what
the
pennsylvania
--
the
state
filed
in
its
own
supreme
court
--
wrapped
up
in
procedural
arguments,
harmless
error
allegations,
perhaps
alternative
state
grounds.
and
this
court
often
has
decided
that
habeas
is
a
better
place
to
work
that
out,
not
gvr.
now,
it
may
well
have
gvred,
but
it
--
i
don't
think
the
court
wants
to
take
on
that
responsibility.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
can
think
of
--
let
me
take
it
one
step
at
a
time.
i
think
there
are
cases
that
this
court
doesn't
gvr.
because
they
are
so
procedurally
complicated,
the
court
leaves
it.
in
fact,
i
can
think
of
one
case
right
now
in
california.
after
melendez-diaz
there
was
a
case
called
geyer
that
came
out
of
the
california
courts,
that
this
court
did
--
held
for
melendez-diaz
but
did
not
gvr,
in
part
because
i
think
the
state
was
making
harmless
error
allegations
there.
and
now
the
states
and
california
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
in
light
of
that.
so
that's
one
example,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
let
me
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
with
the
assumption
that
if
he
has
a
lawyer
he's
going
to
bring
it
up
here.
of
course,
mr.
greene's
right
to
appointed
counsel
under
pennsylvania
state
law
ended
when
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
dismissed
his
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
correct,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
okay.
so
let
me
address
that.
so
there
--
i
don't
think
it
is
a
given,
your
honor,
that
we
would
have
been
able
--
mr.
greene
would
have
been
able
to
bring
this
claim
in
the
pennsylvania
state
court.
the
--
the
justices
on
--
the
judges
on
the
third
circuit
disagreed
about
that
and
it's
unsettled
under
pennsylvania
law.
but
what
is
clear
is
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
do
say
that
now,
justice
ginsburg,
and
all
i
can
say
is
we
checked
as
hard
as
we
could
to
find
an
actual
case
in
pennsylvania
in
the
procedural
posture
of
somebody
going
back
in
the
situation,
and
we
haven't
found
one--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
either
decides
it
or
the
state
takes
a
position
one
way
or
the
other.
but
there
are
many
states
--
you
don't
have
to
dwell
on,
just
on
pennsylvania,
because
there
are
states
--
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
--
that
would
not
let
somebody
like
mr.
gray
go
into
state
court.
and
indeed,
the
amicus
brief
from
the
group
of
states
i
think
is
telling
in
its
silence,
that
none
of
the
12
states
that
signed
on
to
that
brief
are
willing
to
say
you
could
bring
a
claim
like
this
in
collateral
review
in
our
own
state
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
and
the
way
you
frame
it,
though,
frames
what
sounds
to
me
more
like
an
exhaustion
argument
than
it
does
about
a
statutory
construction
argument
with
respect
to
2254(d).
and
this
court
has
never
held
either
that
you
have
to
seek
cert
in
this
court
in
order
to
exhaust
state
remedies,
nor
to
take
a
--
to
take
a
claim
back
to
state
collateral
review
that
you
have
already
taken
up
through
the
state
direct
review
system.
so
if
we
had
an
exhaustion
case
in
the
future,
maybe
somebody
would
make
that
argument.
but
that's
not
what
is
before
you
today.
what's
before
you
today
is
the
hypothetical
that
--
that
mr.
greene
actually
did
seek
cert
and
for
some
reason
this
didn't
gvr,
or
he
did
seek
review
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
they
refused
to
hear
it.
and
under
the
state's
position,
even
then
you
would
bar
him
from
getting
the
reliance
on
gray,
because
gray
came
down
after
the
pennsylvania
supreme
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
he
very
much
had
raised
the
gray
issue
below,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
absolutely
right
that
the
state,
faced
with
really
no
alternative
but
to
try
to
argue
waiver,
did
argue
waiver
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
which
did
dismiss
the
case.
but
of
course
the
order
doesn't
say
why
it
dismissed
the
case.
and
we
litigated
that
very
issue
in
the
lower
courts,
and
the
third
circuit
squarely
held
that
mr.
greene
had
in
fact
preserved
his
claim
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
on
top
of
that,
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
had
reached
it
and
resolved
--
understood
him
to
be
raising
a
gray
type
argument
and
resolved
it
by
citing
a
pennsylvania
case
that
had
previously
held
that
just
putting
an
x
in
place
of
--
in
place
of
the
defendant's
name
--
was
good
enough
to
satisfy
bruton.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
we
don't
disagree
that
it's
a
backward-looking
statute.
there
is
a
retroactivity
cutoff.
the
question
is
where
is
it?
and
we
don't
contend,
justice
alito,
that
it's
an
unreasonable
application.
we
contend
that
there
is
more
statutory
language
that
is
contrary
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--there's
two
prongs--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
justice
alito
cited
one
prong
of
2254(d)
which
is
unreasonable
application.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
more
natural--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
was
contrary
to
this
court's
clearly
established
law
as
of
the
date
of
finality.
so
you
have
a
statute
that
says
it
has
to
be
--
it
resulted
in
a
decision
that
was
contrary--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
it's
the
decision
from
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
justice
scalia,
that
is
contrary
to
clearly
established
law
as
of
the
date
of
finality.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
not
the
date
they
made
it,
no.
but
the
question
of
contrary
to,
as
this
court
said
in
williams
and
has
repeated
many
times,
is
whether
the
lower
court
either
did
one
of
two
things:
decided
a
case
--
decided
the
case
with
a
question
of
law
and
decided
the
question
of
law
opposite
of
how
this
court
has
decided
it;
or
decided
the
case
differently
than
this
court
has
in
another
case
on
materially
indistinguishable
facts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
kagan,
no,
we
don't
think
it
does,
because
there
has
always
been
a
difference
between
facts
and
law.
so
this
court
of
course
held
in
pinholster
that
you
look
at
the
factual
record
that
existed
before
the
state
court,
but
ordinary
appellate
review
and
principles
have
always
allowed
new
law
to
be
considered
up
to
a
certain
point.
so
it's
consistent
with
pinholster
to
say
you
take
the
set
of
facts,
just
as
you
would
from
a
trial
court,
but
that
new
law
up
to
the
point
of
finality
is
--
can
be
considered.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we
don't
--
again,
we
don't
disagree
at
all
that
it's
in
the
past
tense.
the
question
is
where
in
the
past
is
the
cutoff?
so
what
we
say
is
--
and
it's
important
what
this
court
did
say
in
pinholster.
in
pinholster,
it
didn't
say
that
the
plain
language
of
2254(d)
resolved
this.
it
said
that
--
i
think
i'm
going
to
get
this
quote
right
--
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
compelled
the
conclusion
that
for
facts
you
leave
the
window.
well,
the
structure
of
this
statute
as
to
law
compels
the
opposite
conclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
for
a
few
reasons--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
can
get
this
point
across.
i'm
not
saying
"is",
because
then
there
would
be
no
retroactivity
cutoff
whatsoever.
i
agree
that
the
statute
says
"was",
but
it's
was
as
of
when?
we
say
"was"
as
of
the
time
of
finality.
the
state
wants
to
read
into
the
statute
"was"
as
of
the
time
the
decision
was
made.
so
that's
the
question
you
have.
and
if
you
look
to
the
structure
of
the
statute,
you
will
see
lots
of
clues
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
change
the
previous
clear
retroactivity
cutoff
at
teague.
and
of
course,
that's
a
barrier
the
state
has
to
overcome
here,
clear
and
specific
change
in
law.
if
you
look
at
the
limitations
provision,
it
references
finality.
if
you
look
at
various
provisions
of
the
statute
that
reference
retroactivity
law,
they
reference
new
rules
in
retroactivity.
and
this
court
has
held
in
tyler
v.
cain
that
teague
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
did
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--justice
sotomayor,
we
think
horn
is
another
structural
component
of
the
statute
that
shows
why
we
win.
and
let
me
explain
why.
again,
we
don't
disagree
it's
a
backward-looking
statute,
but
backward-looking
to
finality.
now,
what
horn
held
--
horn
rejected
a
form
of
the
very
same
argument
that
the
state
is
making
today,
which
is
2254(d)
changes
retroactivity
law
to
establish
the
cutoff
at
the
time
of
the
state
court
decision,
not
as
of
finality.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said,
no,
teague
and
2254(d)
are
distinct.
and
we
think
the
best
way
to
understand
them
as
distinct
is
to
understand
that
2254(d)
deals
with
a
standard
of
review,
and
teague
still
continues
to
control
finality.
now,
in
light
of
horn
--
i'm
sorry
--
retroactivity.
now
in
light
of
horn
on
the
books,
if
the
state
were
right
that
what
2254(d)
was
actually
trying
to
do
was
also
do
retroactivity
work
and
prevent
the
state
courts
from,
as
it
put
in
its
brief,
from
being
2254(d)
is
actually
concerned
with
setting
a
cutoff
at
the
time
of
the
last
state
court
decision
for
retroactivity
purposes,
you
don't
need
teague
any
more.
so
horn
would
have
had
to
come
out
the
other
way
if
the
state
is
right.
now,
let
me
go
back
to
one
other
structural
feature
of
the
statute
that
explains
--
that
shows
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
teague
would
continue.
that's
the
one
i
referenced
earlier
with
respect
to
retroactivity.
keep
in
mind
the
state's
argument
would
bar
not
just
somebody
like
greene
from
relying
on
a
new
case
like
gray,
but
it
would
also
--
the
implication
would
be
--
it
would
bar
him
from
relying
on
a
new
case
like
roper
v.
simmons,
graham
v.
florida,
or
other
cases
that
alter
substantively
--
say
the
constitution
can
no
longer
cover
or
punish
substantive
conduct
in
a
certain
way.
because
again,
if
teague
is
out
of
the
picture--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well
--
but,
no,
the
state's
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it's
not
different
--
under
the
state's
view
of
aedpa,
justice
kennedy.
remember,
the
state's
view
of
aedpa
is
that
if
a
decision
comes
down
after
the
lay
state
court's
decision
on
the
merits,
then
the
defendant
cannot
seek
relief
based
on
it.
and
then
page
38
of
the
red
brief,
in
footnote
12,
they
try
to
deal
with
this
problem,
but
not
in
a
satisfactory
way.
and
it's
not
an
abstract
problem.
if
i
give
this
court
a
few
citations
--
if
you'll
permit
me
to
give
you
three
citations
of
working
through
the
lower
courts
right
now
that
raise
roper,
graham
and
adkins
claims,
that
the
lower
court's
the
only
way
they
have
reached
them
is
by
saying
that
teague
still
has
--
has
a
role
to
play
with
respect
to
2254(d).
and
the
three
citations,
if
i
can
give
them
very
quickly,
are
arroyo
362
f.
supp.
2nd
869,
holiday
339
f.
3d
1169,
and
simms
2007
westlaw
1161696.
again,
that's
another
structural
feature
of
the
statute
that
the
state
simply
can't
get
around
with
this
--
with
its
view.
now,
some
of
the
lower
courts
haven't
quite
focused
on
this,
and
in
fact,
it's
because
for
many,
many
years
after
aedpa
was
passed,
states
didn't
even
make
the
argument
that
you
have
before
you
today.
all
the
way
through
smith
v.
spisak,
which
came
to
this
court
just
a
couple
of
years
ago,
the
state
of
ohio
for
example
was
not
even
making
this
argument,
which
is
quite
odd
--
if
you
step
back
for
a
moment
and
realize
that
the
state's
position
today
is
that
the
plain
text
of
aedpa
is
so
clear
that
there
is
no
possible
way
you
could
read
it
in
any
other
direction.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
answer
that
question
by
starting,
if
i
may,
before
aedpa,
because
before
aedpa
under
caspari
and
teague
there
is
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
that
is
what
a
federal
habeas
court
would
have
done,
is
say
the
cutoff
is
finality.
because,
remember,
finality
doesn't
exist
in
a
vacuum.
it
exists
against
the
griffith
rule.
so
what
federal
courts
had
always
asked
is,
did
the
defendant
not
get
credit
for
a
case
that
he's
entitled
to
under
griffith?
so
the
question
is
did
aedpa
change
that
rule.
and
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
about
the
purpose
or
spirit
of
aedpa.
we
think
what
the
spirit
of
aedpa
is,
is
to
give
states
deference
and
to
give
them
comity
where
they
otherwise
didn't
have
it
at
the
time.
and
so
it
changed
the
standard
of
review,
it
changed
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
it
didn't
need
to
change
teague.
it
didn't
need
to
change
retroactivity
because,
as
this
court
had
explained
in
teague
itself,
in
justice
kennedy's
long
opinion
in
wright
v.
west
concurring,
the
very
purpose
of
teague
was
to
give
states
the
comity
that
--
of
not
foisting
new
law
upon
them.
so
you
do
end
up,
of
course,
in
this
situation,
which
is
i
think
we
called
it
earlier
the
twilight
zone
or
perfect
storm
situation.
but
this
is
something
that
this
court
saw
coming
under
teague
and
long
ago,
even
though
even
under
those
cases
this
court
said
the
purpose
of
retroactivity
law
is
not
to
hold
the
state
responsible
for
something
new.
so
the
question
is
why
do
we
have
this
twilight
zone
under
teague
and
why
should
it
continue
today,
and
the
answer
again
is
because
teague
doesn't
exist
in
a
vacuum;
it
works
in
tandem
with
griffith.
remember,
what
griffith
said
is
that
it
violates
basic
norms
of
constitutional
adjudication
for
a
defendant
to
not
get
the
credit
for
a
decision
that
this
court
announces
before
his
state
conviction
becomes
final.
so
teague
is
necessary
as
the
other
side
of
the
coin
to
make
griffith
work.
and
to
undo
all
of
that
and
to
go
back
to
an
unsettled
state
of
retroactivity
law,
whether
it's
linkletter
or
something
else,
is
going
to
really
cause
problems.
let
me
give
you
one
other
image
that
the
states'
situation--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--here's
why,
justice
ginsburg.
take
the
typical
case,
and
maybe
you
will
put
in
your
mind,
for
example,
the
martinez
oral
argument
you
had
last
week.
a
typical
case
works
its
way
through
the
state
courts.
there
is
going
to
be
an
appeal
as
of
right
in
the
state
intermediate
court,
where
all
the
claims
the
defendant
brings
can
be
addressed.
then
what
might
happen
quite
often
is
the
state
supreme
court
is
going
to
hear,
like
this
court
does,
maybe
one
or
two
of
those
claims
and
address
them
on
the
merits.
then
he's
going
to
go
into
state
collateral
review
and
bring
an
iac
claim,
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
and
maybe
whatever
other
claim
he
couldn't
have
brought
earlier.
under
the
state's
rule,
you
have
three
different
retroactivity
cutoffs
for
different
claims
that
are
brought
and
adjudicated
at
the
different
parts
of
that
regime.
you
have
a
retroactivity
cutoff
at
the
intermediate
court
for
certain
claims,
a
retroactivity
cutoff
at
the
pennsylvania
--
i'm
sorry;
the
state
supreme
court
for
certain
other
claims;
and
a
retroactivity
cutoff
in
finality
for
certain
other
claims.
and
we
think
that's
just
unwieldy
and,
not
only
that,
it's
just
difficult.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
does
tell
you
to
go
on
a
claim
by
claim
basis,
that's
right.
and
therein
lies
the
difficulty.
with
our
system
you
simply
look
at
the
date
of
finality
for
purposes
of
any
claim
being
adjudicated
on
federal
habeas.
under
the
state
system
you
have
to
go
claim
by
claim
with
different
dates
and
have
arguments,
as
this
court
did
in
pinholster,
for
example,
about
whether
this
claim
is
the
same
claim
that
was
brought,
or
the
state
supreme
court
decided
this
claim
but
not
the
other
claim,
and
whether
the
states--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
objecting
to
the
claim-by-claim
nature
of
the
approach.
i'm
just
saying
it
would
be
unwieldy
and
administratively
difficult
and
therefore
i
think
you
can
question
whether
congress
would
have
contemplated
not
just
going
claim
by
claim
for
purposes
of
adjudication,
but
for
purposes
of
retroactivity
analysis.
and
it
just
is
going
to
create
problems
that
i
don't
think
anyone
would
argue,
and
i
don't
think
the
state
has
even
intended
that
congress
had
any
of
this
in
mind
when
it
passed
this.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think,
justice
breyer--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
are
right
there
is
arbitrariness
built
into
any
cutoff.
the
state
makes
this
point
in
its
brief.
but
by
disjoining
habeas
law
from
griffith,
you
are
going
to
create
a
whole
new
level
of
arbitrariness
that
we
think
is
undesirable
and
unnecessary.
so
for
example,
in
a
situation
like
this
everything
is
going
to
turn
on
whether
a
state
supreme
court
grants
review
and
ultimately
disposes
an
issue
on
the
merits.
and
many
state
supreme
courts
might
take
the
view
that,
well,
hey,
if
the
state
supreme
court
--
if
the
u.s.
supreme
court
has
just
decided
this
issue
and
we
don't
have
any
new
law
to
make
here,
this
isn't
worth
our
time.
so
we're
just
going
to
let
it
go.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
many
state
supreme
courts
--
i
think
there
is
a
possible
two
questions
you
asked.
one
is
whether
state
supreme
courts
in
that
situation
would
themselves
gdr
back
to
the
immediate
court.
pennsylvania
by
our
estimation
doesn't
seem
to
do
that.
and
many
state
supreme
courts
don't
do
it.
they
don't
have
to
do
it.
and
again
you
have
the
problem,
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
somebody
to
bring
the
case
up
to
this
court
and
say
that's
the
only
way
that
he
can
get
benefit
of
the
new
decision,
i
think
this
court
--
i
know
it's
counterintuitive,
but
you
are
going
to
have
to
take
a
hard
look,
not
just
at
fairness
and
equity,
but
at
this
court's
right
to
counsel
jurisprudence,
and
ask
yourself
whether
somebody
under
the
halbert
test
who
has
a
right
to
have
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
that
claim
and
that's
the
only
time
it
can
be
litigated,
therefore
has
to
have
the
right
to
counsel
because
he
couldn't
otherwise
navigate
the
process.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
there
is
at
least
a
back-up,
a
back-up
that
doesn't
exist
today
--
or
i'm
sorry,
that
wouldn't
exist
under
the
state's
rule.
so
the
difference
it
would
make
would
be
he
would
have
a
second
chance
to
bring
the
claim
where
if
he
brought
it
the
district
courts
often
would
appoint
counsel.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
let
me
make
three
points.
starting
with
the
most
important,
which
is
the
teague
exceptions
we
have
been
talking
about.
now,
the
state
in
its
brief
in
footnote
12
and
today
says
actual
innocence,
cause
and
prejudice,
or
something,
would
let
you
get
around
the
problem
that
i've
raised.
but
that
doesn't
work,
because
all
those
doctrines
do
is
allow
you
to
bring
the
case
forward.
they
just
allow
you
to
get
out
from
under
a
situation
where
you
haven't
preserved
a
claim
previously.
but
this
case
is
all
about
a
situation
where
the
defendant
does
everything
he
is
supposed
to
do,
everything
he
can
do,
but
it
just
so
happens
that
this
court's
decision
has
come
down
after
the
last
state
court
decision
on
the
merits,
and
the
state
on
collateral
review
has
refused
--
if
it's
been
given
a
chance
--
to
remedy
that.
the
three
cases
i
cited
to
you,
at
least
one
of
them
involves
a
situation
where
the
defendant
did
go
back
to
the
state.
and
i
believe
it
is
the
graham
case,
and
said
apply
this
to
me
--
the
state
of
virginia
said
no,
you
are
barred
from
state
collateral
review.
so
all
those
doctrines
do
is
allow
the
defendant
to
get
in
the
door.
once
he's
in
the
door,
he
still
has
to
satisfy
2254(d)(1),
which
says
that
no
claim
shall
be
granted
--
no
--
habeas
relief
shall
not
be
granted
on
any
claim
unless
the
language
we
have
been
talking
about
today.
so
the
only
way
out
of
the
problem
that
we
have
phrased
is
to
say
that
teague
decides
what
is
clearly
established
law,
not
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
under
the
state's
reading
of
the
statute.
the
second
thing
is,
as
to
this
court's
gvr
practice
--
i
don't
think
there
is
much
doubt,
in
all
fairness--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
not
if
the
state
says
that
you
are
barred
in
its
own
--
that
would
get
you
out
from
the
problem
of
being
able
to
get
in
the
door,
because
what
would
happen
in
that
situation
is
the
state
would
say
this
is
waived
because
he
didn't
make
it
earlier.
then
you
go
to
the
teague
--
you
go
to
the
exceptions
in
aedpa
for
new
claims,
and
whether
actual
innocence
applies,
et
cetera.
all
those
are
merely
gateways
to
the
question
of
whether
defendant
gets
relief
which
is
controlled
by
2254(d).
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
would
satisfy
one
of
the
teague
exceptions.
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
all
held.
if
it
wouldn't
--
certainly
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
raised
about
the
first
amendment
would
satisfy
the
teague
exception,
and
you
would
have
the
exactly
the
same
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
we
think
it
applies
anytime
afterwards,
too.
but
that
just
makes
the
problem
bigger
than
just
the
twilight
zone.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
decision
on
the
merits,
justice
breyer.
the
decision
on
the
merits
would
have
been
earlier
in
the
proceedings,
when
you
argued
i
can't
be
executed
because
i
was
17
when
i
committed
the
crime,
and
a
state
would
have
rejected
that
before
roeper,
and
then
you
end
up
after
roeper,
a
state
saying
we
won't
hear
this
on
collateral
review
because
we've
already
heard
it
once.
and
then
we
have
the
situation
we
have
today,
and
the
only
way
out
of
that
situation
is
to
understand
that
teague
continues
to
control
what
is
clearly
established
law.
it
is
not
just
a
problem
--
again,
it
goes
back
to
the
structure
of
the
whole
statute,
because
the
question
this
court
is
supposed
to
be
asking
itself
is,
is
there
clear
and
specific
language
in
the
new
statute
to
think
that
congress
wanted
to
dispense
with
teague?
and
this
is
very
clear
indication
that
no
--
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind,
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
so
this
is
a
case
not
just
about
habeas
law,
but
also
this
court's
relationship
with
congress,
about
whether
congress
clearly
had
the
kind
of
intent
that
is
necessary.
