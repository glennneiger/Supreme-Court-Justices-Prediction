respondent
said

could.
justice

the
respondent
in
the
brief
said
that
if
you
had
sought
post-conviction
relief
in
the
state
courts,
then
you
could
have
argued
gray
was
the
controlling
decision,
and
they
would
have
accepted
that
gray.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
apparently
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
thought
that
he
hadn't
properly
raised
it.
i
mean,
they
initially
granted
review
post
gray,
and
then
they
found
that
the
grant
was
improvident
most
likely
because
greene
had
not
raised
the
--
the
gray
issue
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
as
of
the
date
they
made
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
statute
says
adjudication
resulted
in
a
decision,
and
the
decision,
the
only
decision,
is
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
because
there
was
a
non-decision
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
resulted
--
that
if
--
in
a
decision
that
was
--
didn't
say
"is"
--
i
mean,
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
argument
if
it
had
read
"resulted
in
a
decision
that
is
contrary.
"
but
when
it
says
"was",
that
sounds
like
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication.
justice

mr.
fisher,
what
about
the
--
the
purpose
of
aedpa
was
to
require
the
federal
courts
to
respect
the
state
courts'
decisions.
and
there's
only
been
one
decision
in
this
picture,
and
that
decision
was
the
pennsylvania
superior
court.
and
we
are
not
giving
much
respect
to
that
decision,
which
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
gray,
if
we're
going
to
say,
no,
we
have
to
look
at
that
decision
as
though
gray
were
already
on
the
books.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
understand
the
problem.
if
you
look
at
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
decision
and
say,
as
of
that
time
it
was
no
violation
of
any
clearly
established
law,
period.
why
is
that
complicated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
left
of
it?
