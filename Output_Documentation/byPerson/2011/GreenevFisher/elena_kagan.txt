justice
elena
kagan
well,
he
doesn't--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
how
do
you
square
your
argument
with
pinholster?
because
i
thought
that
what
we
said
in
pinholster
just
last
year
is
no
monday
morning
quarterback.
we
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
court
at
the
time.
we
look
at
what
the
court
looked
at.
we
know
what
the
court
knew,
and
we
make
the
decision
--
and
we
made
the
decision
on
that
ground.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
just
runs
smack
into
that
holding.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
understand
how
there
can
be
a
distinction
between
facts
and
law
for
many
purposes,
but
pinholster
rested
on
a
view
of
the
statute,
which
was
basically
the
view
that
justice
alito
gave
you,
which
said
everything
in
the
statute
is
framed
in
the
past
tense.
what
the
statute
is
getting
at
is
--
is
the
decision
at
the
time
the
state
court
made
it.
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
understand--
justice
elena
kagan
--that,
mr.
fisher,
because
you
want
to
do
this
in
federal
habeas,
where
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
either.
so
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
it
was
the
case
that
congress
supplanted
teague
to
the
extent
that
you
said
it
did,
why
is
it,
as
mr.
fisher
says,
that
it
took
states
upwards
of
10
years
to
figure
this
out?
