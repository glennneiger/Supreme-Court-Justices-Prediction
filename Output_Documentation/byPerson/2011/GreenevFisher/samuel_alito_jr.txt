justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
square
your
position
with
what
2254(d)
says,
that
there
must
be
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law?
what
the
intermediate
appellate
court
did
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
or
--
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
law
when
they
did
it.
so
how
do
you
get
around
that
one?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
other
is
it
was--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
was
contrary
to.
how
was
it
contrary
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
answer
is
that
the
state
in
that
situation,
the
state
courts
in
that
situation
would
entertain
the
claim.
but
what
if
they
didn't?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it
was
a
case
like
gideon
v.
wainwright?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
the
claim
under
graham
is
--
is
a
different
claim
from
any
previous
claim.
doesn't
that
get
you
out
from
under
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
a
case
like
graham
or
adkins
applies
only
to
those
who
--
whose
cases
are
pending
on
direct
review
at
the
time
when
the
case
was
decided,
or
do
you
think
it
applies
to
others?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
this
is
--
if
a
juvenile
is
sentenced
to
death
prior
to
a
decision
--
and
--
i'm
sorry
--
yes,
you
think
it
applies
only
if
it
comes
down
during
that
period?
