justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
normally
a
lawyer
just
looks
to
see
what
the
docket
is.
and
when
there's
a
case
that
seems
to
affect
his
case,
he
asks
for
cert.
and
our
practice
normally,
since
i
have
been
here,
is
where
it
implicates
the
case
you
hold
it
until
the
case
is
decided;
then
a
writing
judge
or
other
people
look
through
it
and
see
if
in
fact
it
really
does
affect
it
and
if
it
does,
we
gvr.
i
mean,
as
a
practicing
lawyer
here,
have
you
discovered
instances
where
we
failed
to
do
that,
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
having
trouble
following
it.
it
may
be
my
fault.
but
the
--
suppose
the
supreme
court
has
now
some
kind
of
interpretation
of
something
that's
new.
now,
there
are
going
to
be
a
wide
range
of
people
that
that
many
might
apply
to
whose
convictions
became
final
or
just
about
final
in
state
courts
at
different
times.
so
it's
obviously
always
going
to
be
somewhat
unfair
and
somewhat
arbitrary
that
it
applies
to
some
and
not
to
others.
so
what
is
the
problem
here?
what
--
the
reading
of
the
statute
on
the
other
side
says:
i'll
tell
you
who
it
applies
to
or
who
it
doesn't
apply
to.
it
doesn't
apply
to
people
who
are
the
last
state
court
decision
was
made
before
the
supreme
court
made
its
decision.
that's
it.
now,
that's
arbitrary
somewhat,
but
you
have
to
cut
and
draw
a
line
somewhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem?
why
is
that
complicated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
the
person
would
say:
look,
the
state
supreme
court
has
--
we
are
under
a
decision
here
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
united
states
supreme
court
held;
will
you
please
either
take
our
case
and
hear
it
or
at
least
send
it
back
to
the
lower
court?
and
wouldn't
most
state
supreme
courts
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
happen
if
--
let's
imagine
smith
is
convicted
of
some
kind
of
disorderly
conduct
and
he
goes
to
the
state
courts
and
it's
upheld.
and
then
sometime
thereafter
i
am
being
vague
on
how
much
time.
maybe
it's
a
couple
of
months
or
something.
the
supreme
court
says
that
particular
kind
of
conduct
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
so
now
it
falls
within
its
exception
for:
you
can't
criminalize
this.
now
habeas
is
filed.
smith
files
habeas.
well
how
can
you
get
that
heard?
because
this
particular
provision
says
that
unless
it
was
clear
at
the
time
under,
in
your
view,
of
the
state
statute,
the
final
state
decision
on
the
matter,
you
can't
get
into
habeas.
how
wasn't
it
clear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
goes
to
state
court
under
a
collateral
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
there
is
no
such--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
quite
far
out,
but
conceivable.
you
argue
that
in
the
state
court
the
state
--
you
would
have
to
go
to
collateral
review
in
state
court
and
argue
that
they
now
have
to
apply
the
new
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
impossible
to
get
out,
because
--
you
say
here's
--
bring
your
collateral
state.
now
the
collateral
state,
you're
imaging,
says
no,
we
can't
have
it
because
it's
time-barred.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
go
into
habeas
and
you
say
the
time
bar
is
no
good,
and
it's
such
an
important
opinion,
you
know,
for
all
the
reasons
in
teague,
that
what
they
did
was
a
time
bar
and
they
wouldn't
hear
it.
okay,
so
you
hear
it.
and
the
claim
is
that
they
made
a
mistake.
that
state
court
that
wouldn't
hear
it
made
a
mistake
in
not
hearing
it
and
deciding
it
for
me.
okay?
so
now
we
have
a
state
court
thing
to
review.
