mr.
michael
a.
carvin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
solicitor
general's
main
premise,
which
is
that
they
can
compel
the
purchase
of
health
insurance
in
order
to
promote
commerce
in
the
health
market
because
it
will
reduce
uncompensated
care.
if
you
accept
that
argument,
you
have
to
fundamentally
alter
the
text
of
the
constitution
and
give
congress
plenary
power.
it
simply
doesn't
matter
whether
or
not
this
regulation
will
promote
health
care
commerce
by
reducing
uncompensated
care;
all
that
matters
is
whether
the
activity
actually
being
regulated
by
the
act
negatively
affects
congress
or
negatively
affects
commerce
regulation,
so
that
it's
within
the
commerce
power.
if
you
agree
with
us
that
this
is
--
exceeds
commerce
power,
the
law
doesn't
somehow
become
redeemed
because
it
has
beneficial
policy
effects
in
the
health
care--
in
other
words,
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
promote
commerce.
congress
has
--
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
and
if
the
power
exceeds
their
permissible
regulatory
authority,
then
the
law
is
invalid.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
absolutely,
chief
justice,
and
that's
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
draw.
when
they
are
acting
within
their
enumerated
power
then
obviously
they
are
promoting
commerce,
but
the
solicitor
general
wants
to
turn
it
into
a
different
power.
he
wants
to
say
we
have
the
power
to
promote
commerce,
to
regulate
anything
to
promote
commerce,
and
if
they
have
the
power
to
promote
commerce
then
they
have
the
power
to
regulate
everything,
right?
because--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'd
--
i'd
like
to
address
that
in
two
ways,
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place
they
keep
playing
mix
and
match
with
the
statistics.
they
say
95
percent
of
us
are
in
the
health
care
market,
okay?
but
that's
not
the
relevant
statistic,
even
from
--
as
the
government
frames
the
issue.
no
one
in
congress
and
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
that
going
to
the
doctor
and
fully
paying
him
creates
a
problem.
the
problem
is
uncompensated
care,
and
they
say
the
uncompensated
care
arises
if
you
have
some
kind
of
catastrophe
--
hit
by
a
bus,
have
some
prolonged
illness.
well,
what
is
the
percentage
of
the
uninsured
that
have
those
sorts
of
catastrophes?
we
know
it
has
got
to
be
a
relative
small
fraction.
so
in
other
words,
the
relevant--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--we
don't.
no,
and
we
don't
know
in
advance,
and
--
and
--
but
that
doesn't
change
the
basic
principle,
that
you
are
nonetheless
forcing
people
for
paternalistic
reasons
to
go
into
the
insurance
market
to
ensure
against
risk
that
they
have
made
the
voluntary
decision
that
they
are
not
--
have
decided
not
to.
but
even--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--which
is--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes,
but
my
point
is
this.
that,
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
conflicts
the
people
who
do
result
in
uncompensated
care,
the
free
riders.
those
are
people
who
default
on
their
health
care
payments.
that
is
an
entirely
different
group
of
people,
an
entirely
different
activity
than
being
uninsured.
so
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
can
regulate
activity
because
it
has
a
statistical
connection
to
an
activity
that
harms
congress.
and
my
basic
point
to
you
is
this:
the
constitution
only
gives
congress
the
power
to
regulate
things
that
negatively
affect
commerce
or
commerce
regulation.
it
doesn't
give
them
the
power
to
regulate
things
that
are
statistically
connected
to
things
that
negatively
affect
the
commerce--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--because
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
was
just
going
to
say,
because
if
they
have
that
power,
then
they
obviously
have
the
power
to
regulate
everything
because
everything
in
the
aggregate
is
statistically
connected
to
something
that
negatively
affects
commerce,
and
every
compelled
purchase
promotes
commerce.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well,
in
all
candor,
i
think
morrison
must
have
decided
that
issue,
right?
because
people
who
commit
violence
against--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
i'm
sorry;
my
answer
is
no,
they
couldn't
do
it,
because
morrison--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
may--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--may
i
just
please
explain
why?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
violence
against
women
obviously
creates
the
same
negative
impression
on
fellow
citizens
as
this
communicable
disease,
but
the
--
and
it
has
huge
effects
on
the
health
care
of
our
country.
congress
found
that
it
increased
health
care
costs
by--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--well,
but--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
--
i
don't
know
why
having
a
disease
is
any
more
local
than
--
that
beating
up
a
woman.
but
--
but
--
my
basic
point
is,
is
that
notwithstanding
its
very
profound
effect
on
the
health
care
market,
this
court
said
the
activity
being
regulated,
i.e.,
violence
against
women,
is
outside
the
commerce
clause
power.
so
regardless
of
whether
it
has
beneficial
downstream
effects,
we
must
say
no,
congress
doesn't
have
that
power.
why
not?
because
everything
has
downstream
effects
on
commerce
and
every
compelled
purchase
promotes
commerce.
it
by
definition
helps
the
sellers
of
existing--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--what
they
can't
do
--
yes,
if
you
have
a
car,
they
can
require
you
to
have
an
anti-pollution--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it's
this.
they
can't
require
you
to
buy
a
car
with
an
anti-pollution
device.
once
you've
entered
the
market
and
made
a
decision
they
can
regulate
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
car
that
you
do,
and
they
can
do
it
for
all
sorts
of
reasons.
what
they
can't
do
it
compel
you
to
enter
the
market.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
if
being
born
is
entering
the
market,
then
i
can't
think
of
a
more
plenary
power
congress
can
have,
because
that
literally
means
they
can
regulate
every
human
activity
from
cradle
to
grave.
i
thought
that's
what
distinguished
the
plenary
police
power
from
the
very
limited
commerce
power.
i
don't
disagree
that
giving
the
congress
plenary
power
to
mandate
property
transfers
from
a
to
b
would
be
a
very
efficient
way
of
helping
b
and
of
accomplishing
congress's
objectives.
but
the
framers--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
--
i
was
facing
the
same
dilemma,
justice
kagan.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
well
i
don't
think
the
test
of
a
law's
constitutionality
is
whether
it
more
adheres
to
the
libertarian
principles
of
the
cato
institute
or
the
statist
principles
of
someone
else.
i
think
the
test
of
a
law's
constitutionality
is
not
those
policy
questions;
it's
whether
or
not
the
law
is
regulating
things
that
negatively
affect
commerce
or
don't.
and
since
obviously
the
failure
to
purchase
an
item
doesn't
create
the
kind
of
effects
on
supply
and
demand
that
the
market
participants
in
wickard
and
raich
did
and
doesn't
in
any
way
interfere
with
regulation
of
the
insurance
companies,
i
don't
think
it
can
pass
the
basic--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--oh,
but
let's
be
careful
about
what
they
were
regulating
in
wickard,
justice
ginsburg.
what
they
were
regulating
was
the
supply
of
wheat.
it
didn't
in
any
way
imply
that
they
could
require
every
american
to
go
out
and
buy
wheat.
and
yes,
one
of
the
consequences
of
regulating
local
market
participants
is
it'll
affect
the
supply
and
the
demand
for
the
product.
that's
why
you
can
regulate
them,
because
those
local
market
participants
have
the
same
effect
on
the
interstate
market
that
a
black
market
has
on
a
legal--
but
none
of
that
is
true
--
in
other
words,
you
can
regulate
local
bootleggers,
but
that
doesn't
suggest
you
can
regulate
teetotalers,
people
who
stay
out
of
the
liquor
market,
because
they
don't
have
any
negative
effect
on
the
existing
market
participants
or
on
regulation
of
those
market
participants.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
no
again.
the
people
who
impose
the
costs
on
the
rest
of
us
are
people
who
engage
in
a
different
activity
at
a
different
time,
which
is
defaulting
on
their
health
care
payments.
it's
not
the
uninsured.
under
your
theory
you
could
regulate
anybody
if
they
have
got
a
statistical
connection
to
a
problem.
you
could
say,
since
we
could
regulate
people
who
enter
into
the
mortgage
market
and
impose
mortgage
insurance
on
them,
we
can
simply
impose
the
requirement
to
buy
private
mortgage
insurance
on
everybody
before
they
have
entered
the
market
because
we
are
doing
it
in
this
prophylactic
way
before
it
develops.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
two
points,
one
of
which
mr.
clement's
already
made,
which
is
the
health
insurance
market
is
different
than
the
health
care
market.
but
let
me
take
it
on
full-stride.
i
think
everybody
is
in
the
milk
market.
i
think
everybody
is
in
the
wheat
product
market.
but
that
doesn't
suggest
that
the
government
compel
you
to
buy
five
gallons
of
meat
or
five
bushels
of
wheat
because
they
are
not
regulating
commerce.
whether
you're
a
market
participant
or
not,
they
are
still
requiring
you
to
make
a
purchase
that
you
don't
want
to
do,
and
to
get
back
to
your
facial
example--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i've
sorry?
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
you
are
not
forced
to
buy
a
product
you
don't
want.
and
i
agree
with
you
that
since
the
government
regulates
all
markets
there
is
no
limiting
principle
on
their
compelled
purchase.
when
they
put
these
environmental
controls
on
the--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
let's
think
about
it
this
way.
yes,
when
you've
entered
the
marketplace
they
can
impose
all
sorts
of
restrictions
on
you,
and
they
can
impose,
for
example,
all
kinds
of
restrictions
on
states
after
they
have
enacted
laws.
they
can
wipe
out
the
laws.
they
can
condition
them.
but
what
can't
they
do?
they
can't
compel
states
to
enact
laws.
they
can't
compel
states
to
carry
out
federal
law.
and
i
am
arguing
for
precisely
the
same
distinction,
because
everyone
intuitively
understands
that
regulating
participants
after
a
and
b
have
entered
into
a
contract
is
fundamentally
less
intrusive
than
requiring
the
contract.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
i
fully
agree
with
you,
justice
sotomayor.
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
cases
you
referred
to
i
think
effectively
eliminated
the
distinction
between
participants
in
the
intrastate
market
vis
--
vis
participants
in
the
interstate
market.
none
of
those
cases
suggest
that
you
can
regulate
people
who
are
outside
of
the
market
on
both
an
intrastate
and
interstate
level
by
compelling
them
to
enter
into
the
market.
and
that--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--judge
sutton
is
wrong
in
each
and
every
example.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
compulsion
in
raich
for
him
to
buy
wheat.
he
could
have
gotten
wheat
substitutes
or
he
could
have
not
sold
wheat,
which
is
actually
what
he
was
doing.
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
conditioning
regulation,
i.e.,
conditioning
access
to
the
health
care
market
and
saying
you
must
buy
a
product,
and
forcing
you
to
buy
a
product.
and
that,
that
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
guaranteed-issue.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
oh,
sure.
and
that's
why
--
but
we
don't
in
any
way
impede
that
sort
of
regulation.
these
nondiscrimination
regulations
will
apply
to
every
insurance
company
just
as
congress
intended
whether
or
not
we
buy
insurance.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
"work".
it'll
work
just
fine
in
ensuring
that
no
sick
people
are
discriminated
against.
what
--
what
--
but
when
you
do
that
--
congress--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--yes.
well,
that's
--
this
is
the
government's
very
illogical
argument.
they
seem
to
be
saying
look,
we
couldn't
just
force
people
to
buy
insurance
to
lower
health
insurance
premiums.
that
would
be
no
good.
but
we
can
do
it
because
we've
created
the
problem.
we,
congress,
have
driven
up
the
health
insurance
premiums,
and
since
we've
created
that
problem,
this
somehow
gives
us
authority
that
we
wouldn't
otherwise
have.
that
can't
possibly
be
right.
that
would--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--one
of
the
most--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--one
of
the
more
pernicious,
misleading
impressions
that
the
government
has
made
is
that
we
are
somehow
advocating
that
people
be
--
could
get
thrown
out
of
emergency
rooms,
or
that
this
alternative
that
they've
hypothesized
is
going
to
be
enforced
by
throwing
people
out
of
emergency
rooms.
this
alternative;
i.e.
conditioned
access
to
health
care
on
buying
health
insurance,
is
enforced
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
the
act
does.
you
either
buy
health
insurance
or
you
pay
a
penalty
of
$695.
you
don't
have
doctors
throwing
people
out
on
the
street.
and
--
and
so
the
only--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no.
no.
i
was
--
they
create
this
strawman
that
says
look,
the
only
alternative
to
doing
it
the
way
we've
done
it,
if
we
condition
access
to
health
care
on
buying
health
insurance,
the
only
way
you
can
enforce
that
is
making
sick
people
not
get
care.
i'm
saying
no,
no.
there's
a
perfectly
legitimate
way
they
could
enforce
their
alternative;
i.e.
requiring
you
to
buy
health
insurance
when
you
access
health
care,
which
is
the
same
penalty
structure
that's
in
the
act.
there
is
no
moral
dilemma
between
having
people
have
insurance
and
denying
them
emergency
service.
congress
has
made
a
perfectly
legitimate
value
judgment
that
they
want
to
make
sure
that
people
get
emergency
care.
since
the
founding,
whenever
congress
has
imposed
that
public
responsibility
on
private
actors,
it
has
subsidized
it
from
the
federal
treasury.
it
has
not
conscripted
a
subset
of
the
citizenry
and
made
them
subsidize
the
actors
who
are
being
hurt,
which
is
what
they're
doing
here.
they're
making
young
healthy
people
subsidize
insurance
premiums
for
the
cost
that
the
nondiscrimination
provisions
have
put
on
insurance
premiums
and
insurance
companies.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--and
that
--
that
is
the
fundamental
problem
here.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
yes.
tax
power
is--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--i
would
accept
that.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
there
may
have
been
some
confusion
in
prior
colloquy.
i
fully
agree
with
my
brother
clement
that
a
direct
tax
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
he
means
to
suggest,
nor
do
i,
that
a
tax
credit
that
incentivizes
you
to
buy
insurance
creates
problems.
congress
incentivizes
all
kinds
of
activities.
if
they
gave
us
a
tax
credit
for
buying
insurance,
then
it
would
be
our
choice
whether
or
not
that
makes
economic
sense,
even
though--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--the
difference
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
not
given
a
choice.
it's
the
difference
between
banning
cigarettes
and
saying
i'm
going
to
enforce
that
legal
ban
through
a
$5
a
pack
penalty,
and
saying
look,
if
you
want
to
sell
cigarettes,
fine.
i'm
going
to
charge
you
a
tax
of
$5
a
pack.
and
that's--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--no.
not--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--right.
and
everyone
understands--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--that's
precisely
my
point.
and
everyone
intuitively
understands
that
that
system
is
dramatically
different
than
saying
cigarettes
tomorrow
are
illegal.
it
is
different.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
let
me--
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
--it
is
clear
that
the
failure
to
buy
health
insurance
doesn't
affect
anyone.
defaulting
on
your
payments
to
your
health
care
provider
does.
congress
chose
for
whatever
reason
not
to
regulate
the
harmful
activity
of
defaulting
on
your
health
care
provider.
they
used
the
20
percent
or
whoever
among
the
uninsured
as
a
leverage
to
regulate
the
100
percent
of
the
uninsured.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
okay.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
and,
your
--
i
may
be
misunderstanding
you,
justice
kennedy.
i
hope
i'm
not.
sure.
it
would
be
perfectly
fine
if
they
allowed
--
you
do
actuarial
risk
for
young
people
on
the
basis
of
their
risk
for
disease,
just
like
you
judge
flood
insurance
on
the
homeowner's
risk
of
flood.
one
of
the
issues
here
is
not
only
that
they're
compelling
us
to
enter
into
the
marketplace,
they're
not
--
they're
prohibiting
us
from
buying
the
only
economically
sensible
product
that
we
would
want.
catastrophic
insurance.
everyone
agrees
the
only
potential
problem
that
a
30-year-old,
as
he
goes
from
the
healthy
70
percent
of
the
population
to
the
unhealthy
5
percent.
and
yet
congress
prohibits
anyone
over
30
from
buying
any
kind
of
catastrophic
health
insurance.
and
the
reason
they
do
that
is
because
they
needed
this
massive
subsidy.
justice
alito,
it's
not
our
numbers.
cbo
said
that
injecting
my
clients
into
the
risk
pool
lowers
premiums
by
15
to
20
percent.
so,
justice
kennedy,
even
if
we
were
going
to
create
exceptions
for
people
that
are
outside
of
commerce
and
inside
of
commerce,
surely
we'd
make
congress
do
a
closer
nexus
and
say
look,
we're
really
addressing
this
problem.
we
want
these
30-year-olds
to
get
catastrophic
health
insurance.
and
not
only
did
they
--
they
deprived
them
of
that
option.
and
i
think
that
illustrates
the
dangers
of
giving
congress
these
plenary
powers,
because
they
can
always
leverage
them.
they
can
always
come
up
with
some
public
policy
rationale
that
converts
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
into
the
power
to
promote
commerce,
which,
as
i
was
saying
before,
is
the
one
that
i
think
is
plenary.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
problem
you
identify
is
exactly
the
problem
you
would
create
if
you
bought
the
government's
bogus
limiting
principles.
you'd
have
to
draw
distinctions
between
the
insurance
industry
and
the
car
industry
and
all
of
that.
we
turn
you
to
the
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
that
bedeviled
the
court
before
the
1930s,
where
they
were
drawing
all
these
kinds
of
distinctions
among
industries;
whereas
our
test
is
really
very
simple.
are
you
buying
the
product
or
is
congress
compelling
you
to
buy
the
product?
i
can't
think
of
a
brighter
line.
and
again,
if
congress
has
the
power
to
compel
you
to
buy
this
product,
then
obviously,
they
have
got
the
power
to
provide
you
--
to
compel
you
to
buy
any
product,
because
any
purchase
is
going
to
benefit
commerce,
and
this
court
is
never
going
to
second-guess
congress's
policy
judgments
on
how
important
it
is
this
product
versus
that
product.
mr.
michael
a.
carvin
the
words
"inactivity"
and
"activity"
are
not
in
the
constitution.
the
words
"commerce"
and
"noncommerce"
are.
and
again,
it's
a
distinction
that
comes,
justice
kagan,
directly
from
the
text
of
the
constitution.
the
framers
consciously
gave
congress
the
ability
to
regulate
commerce,
because
that's
not
a
particularly
threatening
activity
that
deprives
you
of
individual
freedom.
if
you
were
required,
if
you
were
authorized
to
require
a
to
transfer
property
to
b,
you
have,
as
the
early
cases
put
it,
a
monster
in
legislation
which
is
against
all
reason
in
justice,
because
everyone
intuitively
understands
that
regulating
people
who
voluntarily
enter
into
contracts
in
setting
changing
conditions
does
not
create
the
possibility
of
congress
compelling
wealth
transfers
among
the
citizenry.
and
that
is
precisely
why
the
framers
denied
them
the
power
to
compel
commerce,
and
precisely
why
they
didn't
give
them
plenary
power.
