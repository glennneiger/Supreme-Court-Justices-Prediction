justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
depends,
as
--
as
the
government
points
out
on
whether
that
directive
is
a
directive
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
to
how
he
goes
about
getting
this
penalty,
or
rather
a
directive
to
him
and
to
the
courts.
all
--
all
of
the
other
directives
there
seem
to
me
to
be
addressed
to
the
secretary.
why
--
why
should
this
one
be
directed
to
the
courts?
when
you
say
in
the
same
manner,
he
goes
about
doing
it
in
the
same
manner,
but
the
courts
simply
accept
that
--
that
manner
of
proceeding
but
nonetheless
adjudicate
the
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he's
assessing
and
collecting
it
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
long,
i
don't
think
you
are
going
to
come
up
with
any,
but
i
think
your
response
is
you
could
say
that
about
any
jurisdictional
rule.
if
it's
not
jurisdictional,
what's
going
to
happen
is
you
are
going
to
have
an
intelligent
federal
court
deciding
whether
you
are
going
to
make
an
exception.
and
there
will
be
no
parade
of
horribles
because
all
federal
courts
are
intelligent.
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
question
you
can't
answer.
it's
a
question
which
asks
"why
should
there
be
any
jurisdictional
rules?
"
and
you
think
there
should
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
--
there
is
at
least
some
doubt
about
it,
mr.
long,
for
the
reasons
that
justice
breyer
said,
and
i
--
i
thought
that
we
--
we
had
a
principle
that
ousters
of
jurisdiction
are
--
are
narrowly
construed,
that,
unless
it's
clear,
courts
are
not
deprived
of
jurisdiction,
and
i
find
it
hard
to
think
that
this
is
clear.
whatever
else
it
is,
it's
easy
to
think
that
it's
not
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
do
it
again,
because
i
think
that
goes
too
far.
i
don't
think
that's
restraining
the
collection
of
a
tax.
it's
restraining
the
payment
of
a
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
don't
want
to
let
that
bone
go,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
jurisdictional
as
this
court
understands
jurisdiction
now,
it's
not
waivable.
and
therefore,
we
don't
think
that
--
that
that
part
of
the
davis
decision
is
good
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
aren't
those
problems
that
the
federal
government
can
address
directly?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
self
purchasing?
anything
i
--
you
know
if
i'm
in
any
market
at
all,
my
failure
to
purchase
something
in
that
market
subjects
me
to
regulation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
define
the
market
that
broadly?
health
care.
it
may
well
be
that
everybody
needs
health
care
sooner
or
later,
but
not
everybody
needs
a
heart
transplant,
not
everybody
needs
a
liver
transplant.
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
define
the
market
--
everybody
has
to
buy
food
sooner
or
later,
so
you
define
the
market
as
food,
therefore,
everybody
is
in
the
market;
therefore,
you
can
make
people
buy
broccoli.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
principal
basis
for
distinguishing
this
from
other
situations?
i
mean,
you
know,
you
can
also
say,
well,
the
person
subject
to
this
has
blue
eyes.
that
would
indeed
distinguish
it
from
other
situations.
is
it
a
principle
basis?
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
a
basis
that
explains
why
the
government
is
doing
this,
but
is
it
--
is
it
a
basis
which
shows
that
this
is
not
going
beyond
what
--
what
the
--
the
system
of
enumerated
powers
allows
the
government
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
verrilli,
you
--
you
could
say
that
about
buying
a
car.
if
--
if
people
don't
buy
cars,
the
price
that
those
who
do
buy
cars
pay
will
have
to
be
higher.
so
you
could
say
in
order
to
bring
the
price
down,
you
are
hurting
these
other
people
by
not
buying
a
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was.
i
thought
you
were
saying
other
people
are
going
to
have
to
pay
more
for
insurance
because
you're
not
buying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
obligate
yourself
to
that.
why
--
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
could
do
it.
but
--
but
does
that
expand
your
ability
to,
to
issue
mandates
to
--
to
the
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
it's
not.
they
all
involved
commerce.
there
was
no
doubt
that
what
was
being
regulated
was
commerce.
and
here
you're
regulating
somebody
who
isn't
covered.
by
the
way,
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
relevant
market
here
is
health
care.
you're
not
regulating
health
care.
you're
regulating
insurance.
it's
the
insurance
market
that
you're
addressing
and
you're
saying
that
some
people
who
are
not
in
it
must
be
in
it
and
that's
--
that's
difference
from
regulating
in
any
manner
commerce
that
already
exists
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
that's
--
that's
--
it's
both
"necessary
and
proper".
what
you
just
said
addresses
what's
necessary.
yes,
has
to
be
reasonably
adapted.
necessary
does
not
mean
essential,
just
reasonably
adapted.
but
in
addition
to
being
necessary,
it
has
to
be
proper.
and
we've
held
in
two
cases
that
something
that
was
reasonably
adapted
was
not
proper
because
it
violated
the
sovereignty
of
the
states,
which
was
implicit
in
the
constitutional
structure.
the
argument
here
is
that
this
also
is
--
may
be
necessary,
but
it's
not
proper
because
it
violates
an
equally
evident
principle
in
the
constitution,
which
is
that
the
federal
government
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
government
that
has
all
powers;
that
it's
supposed
to
be
a
government
of
limited
powers.
and
that's
what
all
this
questioning
has
been
about.
what
--
what
is
left?
if
the
government
can
do
this,
what,
what
else
can
it
not
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that
wasn't
my
point.
that
is
not
the
only
constitutional
principle
that
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
an
equally
evident
constitutional
principle
is
the
principle
that
the
federal
government
is
a
government
of
enumerated
powers
and
that
the
vast
majority
of
powers
remain
in
the
states
and
do
not
belong
to
the
federal
government.
do
you
acknowledge
that
that's
a
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
the
states
have
chosen
not
to
do,
the
federal
government
can
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
tenth
amendment
says
the
powers
not
given
to
the
federal
government
are
reserved,
not
just
to
the
states,
but
to
the
states
and
the
people.
and
the
argument
here
is
that
the
people
were
left
to
decide
whether
they
want
to
buy
insurance
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you
make
phone
calls.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
stupid.
they're
going
to
buy
insurance
later.
they're
young
and
--
and
need
the
money
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
--
when
they
think
they
have
a
substantial
risk
of
incurring
high
medical
bills,
they'll
buy
insurance,
like
the
rest
of
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
think
that
they're
never
going
to
buy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
solve
that
problem
by
simply
not
requiring
the
insurance
company
to
sell
it
to
somebody
who
has
a
--
a
condition
that
is
going
to
require
medical
treatment,
or
at
least
not
--
not
require
them
to
sell
it
to
him
at
--
at
a
rate
that
he
sells
it
to
healthy
people.
but
you
don't
want
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me
a
self-created
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
problems
congress's
economic
regulation
produces,
whatever
they
are,
i
think
congress
can
do
something
to
counteract
them.
here,
requiring
somebody
to
enter
--
to
enter
the
insurance
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is
that
you
have
40
million
people
who
cannot
get
affordable
insurance
through
the
means
that
the
rest
of
us
get
affordable
insurance.
congress,
after
a
long
study
and
careful
deliberation,
and
viewing
the
experiences
of
the
states
and
the
way
they
tried
to
handle
this
problem,
adopted
a
package
of
reforms.
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating,
and
--
and
subsidies
and
the
minimum
coverage
provision
are
a
package
of
reforms
that
solve
that
problem.
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
highly
artificial
to
view
this
as
a
problem
of
congress's
own
creation.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
--
can
i
tell
you
what
the
something
else
is
so
--
while
you're
answering
it?
the
something
else
is
everybody
has
to
exercise,
because
there's
no
doubt
that
lack
of
exercise
cause
--
causes
illness,
and
that
causes
health
care
costs
to
go
up.
so
the
federal
government
says
everybody
has
to
--
to
join
a
--
an
exercise
club.
that's
--
that's
the
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
fees,
you
know,
license
fees,
fees
for
a
hunting
license,
everybody
knows
those
are
taxes.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there
is
as
much
of
a
difference
between
a
fee
and
a
tax
as
there
is
between
a
penalty
and
a
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
president
said
it
wasn't
a
tax,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
making
two
arguments.
number
one,
it's
a
tax;
and
number
two,
even
if
it
isn't
a
tax,
it's
within
the
taxing
power.
i'm
just
addressing
the
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
a
tax
or
not
a
tax?
the
president
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
all
the
discussion
we
had
earlier
about
how
this
is
one
big
uniform
scheme
and
the
commerce
clause
blah,
blah,
blah,
it
really
doesn't
matter.
this
is
a
tax
and
the
federal
government
could
simply
have
said,
without
all
of
the
rest
of
this
legislation,
could
simply
have
said
everybody
who
doesn't
buy
health
insurance
at
a
certain
age
will
be
taxed
so
much
money,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
didn't
need
that.
--you
didn't
need
that.
if
it's
a
tax,
it's
only
--
raising
money
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
get
to
those
questions
in
inverse
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
like
hear
you
address
justice
breyer's
other,
other
two
principles.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
his
point.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
is
such
a
thing
as
legislative
inertia,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
i
want
to
ask
you
about
that.
why
--
why
do
we
look
to
the
--
are
you
sure
we
look
to
the
intent
of
the
congress?
i
thought
that,
you
know,
sometimes
congress
says
that
these
provisions
will
--
all
the
provisions
of
this
act
will
be
severable.
and
we
ignore
that
when
the
act
really
won't
work.
when
the
remaining
provisions
just
won't
work.
now
how
can
you
square
that
reality
with
the
proposition
that
what
we're
looking
for
here
is
what
would
this
congress
have
wanted?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
they
sure
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
is
it
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
the
consequence
of
your
proposition,
would
congress
have
enacted
it
without
this
provision,
okay
that's
the
consequence.
that
would
mean
that
if
we
struck
down
nothing
in
this
legislation
but
the
--
what
you
call
the
corn
husker
kickback,
okay,
we
find
that
to
violate
the
constitutional
proscription
of
venality,
okay?
when
we
strike
that
down,
it's
clear
that
congress
would
not
have
passed
it
without
that.
it
was
the
means
of
getting
the
last
necessary
vote
in
the
senate.
and
you
are
telling
us
that
the
whole
statute
would
fall
because
the
corn
husker
kickback
is
bad.
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
there
--
there
are
some
provisions
which
nobody
would
have
standing
to
challenge.
if
the
provision
is
simply
an
expenditure
of
federal
money,
it
--
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody
except
the
taxpayer,
but
the
taxpayer
doesn't
have
standing.
that
--
that
just
continues.
even
though
it
--
it
is
--
it
should
--
it
is
so
closely
aligned
to
what's
been
struck
down
that
it
ought
to
go
as
well.
but
nonetheless,
that
has
to
continue
because
there's
nobody
in
the
world
that
can
challenge
it.
can
that
possibly
be
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
those
are
provisions
that
have
been
legitimately
enacted.
the
whole
issue
here
is
whether
these
related
provisions
have
been
legitimately
enacted,
or
whether
they
are
so
closely
allied
to
one
that
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional
that
they
also
have
not
been
legitimately
enacted.
you
--
you
can't
compare
that
to
--
to
cases
dealing
with
a
--
a
statute
that
nobody
denies
is
--
is
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
you
think
it's
unrealistic
to
say
leave
it
to
congress,
as
though
you
are
sending
it
back
to
congress
for
congress
to
consider
it
dispassionately
on
balance,
should
we
have
this
provision
or
should
we
not
have
provision?
that's
not
what
it's
going
to
be.
it's
going
to
be,
these
provisions
are
in
effect;
even
though
you
--
a
lot
of
you
never
wanted
them
to
be
in
effect,
and
you
only
voted
for
them
because
you
wanted
to
get
the
heart
of
the
--
the
act,
which
has
now
been
cut
out;
but
nonetheless
these
provisions
are
the
law,
and
you
have
to
get
the
votes
to
overturn
them.
that's
an
enormously
different
question
from
whether
you
get
the
votes
initially
to
put
them
into
the
law.
what
--
there,
there
is
no
way
that
this
court's
decision
is
not
going
to
distort
the
congressional
process.
whether
we
strike
it
all
down
or
leave
some
of
it
in
place,
the
congressional
process
will
never
be
the
same.
one
way
or
another,
congress
is
going
to
have
to
reconsider
this,
and
why
isn't
it
better
to
have
them
reconsider
it
--
what
--
what
should
i
say
--
in
toto,
rather
than
having
some
things
already
in
the
law
which
you
have
to
eliminate
before
you
can
move
on
to
consider
everything
on
balance?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
what
happened
to
the
eighth
amendment?
you
really
want
us
to
go
through
these
2,700
pages?
and
do
you
really
expect
the
court
to
do
that?
or
do
you
expect
us
to
--
to
give
this
function
to
our
law
clerks?
is
this
not
totally
unrealistic?
that
we
are
going
to
go
through
this
enormous
bill
item
by
item
and
decide
each
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
whether
it's
easy
for
my
clerks.
i
care
whether
it's
easy
for
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
--
can
you
give
us
a
prior
case
in
--
that
--
that
resembles
this
one
in
which
we
--
we
are
asked
to
strike
down
what
the
other
side
says
is
the
heart
of
the
act
and
yet
leave
in
--
as
--
as
you
request,
leave,
in
effect,
the
rest
of
it?
have
we
ever
--
most
of
our
severability
cases,
you
know,
involve
one
little
aspect
of
the
act.
the
question
is
whether
the
rest.
when
have
we
ever
really
struck
down
what
was
the
main
purpose
of
the
act,
and
left
the
rest
in
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
reason
--
the
reason
the
majority
said
that
was
they
didn't
think
that
what
was
essential
to
the
act
was
what
had
been
stricken
down,
and
that
is
the
--
the
ability
of
the
judge
to
say
on
his
own
what
--
what
--
what
the
punishment
would
be.
i
don't
think
that's
a
case
where
we
struck
--
where
we
excised
the
heart
of
the
statute.
you
have
another
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
example.
this
is
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
really
a
case
of
first
impression.
i
don't
know
another
case
where
we
have
been
confronted
with
this
--
with
this
decision.
can
you
take
out
the
heart
of
the
act
and
leave
everything
else
in
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
a
conference
committee
report
afterwards,
maybe.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
anticipation
of
the
minimum
coverage.
that's
going
to
bankrupt
the
insurance
companies
if
not
the
states,
unless
this
minimum
coverage
provision
comes
into
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
many
people
might
not
--
many
of
the
people
in
congress
might
not
have
voted
for
those
provisions
if
--
if
the
central
part
of
this
statute
was
not
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
you're
--
to
say
that
we're
effectuating
the
intent
of
congress
is
just
unrealistic.
once
you've
cut
the
guts
out
of
it,
who
knows,
who
knows
which
of
them
were
really
desired
by
congress
on
their
own
and
which
ones
weren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
why
do
you
say
--
i
didn't
follow
that.
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
their
rates
be
lower?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
is
nothing
about
federal
support
that
is
unsustainable,
right?
that
is
infinite.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
dictionary
that
gives
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
definition
of
"essential"?
it's
very
imaginative.
just
give
me
one
dictionary.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
that?
when
people
speak,
i
assume
they
are
speaking
english.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
farr,
let's
--
let's
consider
how
--
how
your
approach,
severing
as
little
as
possible
there
--
thereby
increases
the
deference
that
we're
showing
to
--
to
congress.
it
seems
to
me
it
puts
congress
in
--
in
this
position:
this
act
is
still
in
full
effect.
there
is
going
to
be
this
deficit
that
used
to
be
made
up
by
the
mandatory
coverage
provision.
all
that
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere.
you
can't
repeal
the
rest
of
the
act
because
you're
not
going
to
get
60
votes
in
the
senate
to
repeal
the
rest.
it's
not
a
matter
of
enacting
a
new
act.
you've
got
to
get
60
votes
to
repeal
it.
so
the
rest
of
the
act
is
going
to
be
the
law.
so
you're
just
put
to
the
choice
of
i
guess
bankrupting
insurance
companies
and
the
whole
system
comes
tumbling
down,
or
else
enacting
a
federal
subsidy
program
to
the
insurance
companies,
which
is
what
the
insurance
companies
would
like,
i'm
sure.
do
you
really
think
that
that
is
somehow
showing
deference
to
congress
and
--
and
respecting
the
democratic
process?
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
gross
distortion
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
--
that
wouldn't
be
my
approach.
my
approach
would
say
if
you
take
the
heart
out
of
the
statute,
the
statute's
gone.
that
enables
congress
to
--
to
do
what
it
wants
in
--
in
the
usual
fashion.
and
it
doesn't
inject
us
into
the
process
of
saying,
"this
is
good,
this
is
bad,
this
is
good,
this
is
bad.
"
it
seems
to
me
it
reduces
our
options
the
most
and
increases
congress's
the
most.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
put
--
why
put
congress
to
that
false
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
only
have
two
choices,
congress.
you
have
the
whole
bill
or
you
can
have,
you
can
have
parts
of
the
bill
or
no
bill
at
all.
why
that
false
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
agree
--
do
you
agree
that
the
government
has
to
act
reasonably?
do
we
strike
down
unreasonable
statutes?
my
god.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
executive
has
to
act
reasonably,
that's
certain,
in
implementing
a
statute;
but,
if
the
statute
says,
in
so
many
words,
that
the
secretary
can
strike
the
whole
--
funding
for
the
whole
program,
that's
the
law,
unreasonable
or
not,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
i
didn't
take
the
time
to
figure
this
out,
but
maybe
you
did.
is
there
any
chance
at
all
that
26
states
opposing
it
have
republican
governors
and
all
of
the
states
supporting
it
have
democratic
governors?
is
that
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
your
second
and
third?
i'm
on
pins
and
needles
to
hear
your
----
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
the
chief
has
said
i
can
ask
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
recall
your
--
your
theory,
it
is
that
to
determine
whether
something
is
coercive,
you
look
to
only
one
side,
how
much
you're
threatened
with
losing
or
offered
to
receive.
and
the
other
side
doesn't
matter.
i
don't
think
that's
realistic.
i
mean,
i
think,
you
know,
the
--
the
old
jack
benny
thing,
your
money
or
your
life,
and,
you
know,
he
says
"i'm
thinking,
i'm
thinking".
it's
--
it's
funny,
because
it's
no
choice.
you
know?
your
life?
again,
it's
just
money.
it's
an
easy
choice.
no
coercion,
right?
i
mean
--
right?
now
whereas,
if
--
if
the
choice
were
your
life
or
your
wife's,
that's
a
lot
harder.
now,
is
it
--
is
it
coercive
in
both
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
tough
choice.
and
--
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
no,
no.
to
say
--
to
say
you're
--
when
you
say
you're
coerced,
it
means
you've
been
--
you've
been
given
an
offer
you
can't
refuse.
okay?
you
can't
refuse
your
money
or
your
life.
but
your
life
or
your
wife's,
i
could
refuse
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
my
life.
i
think
--
take
mine,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
won't
use
that
example.
example.
forget
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
we
meant
in
those
dicta
in
several
prior
cases
where
we've
said
that
the
federal
government
cannot
be
coercive
through
the
spending
clause?
what
--
what
do
you
think
we
were
--
give
us
a
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
else,
so
long
as
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
talking
about
situations
where
they
have
to
locate
their
state
house
in
some
other
city--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
they
have
no
choice.
but
short
of
that,
they
can
make
the
state
do
anything
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
imagine
a
case
in
which
it
is
both
germane
and
yet
coercive,
is
what
you
are
saying.
there
is
no
such
case
as
far
as
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wouldn't
think
that
is
a
surprise
question,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
think
of
one.
i'm
not
blaming
you
for
not
thinking
of
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
there
was
a
serious
political
strain
--
constraint
on
the
individual
mandate,
too,
but
that
didn't
work.
what
you
call
serious
political
constraints
sometimes
don't
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
smaller
it,
is
the
bigger
the
coercion.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
smaller
what
you
are
demanding
of
them,
the
bigger
the
coercion
to
go
along.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
never
do
it
or
would
a
prediction,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
a
limitation
on
the
secretary's
ability
to
cut
off
all
the
funds;
she
can't
do
it
if
it
--
if
that
would
be
unreasonable?
are
you
willing
to
accept
that?
i
wouldn't
if
i
were
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
part
of
the
discretion
is
to
cut
off
all
of
the
funds.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
worry
a
lot
if
i
were
you.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that,
where
the
secretary's
discretion
explicitly
includes
a
certain
act,
we
have
held
that,
nevertheless,
that
act
cannot
be
performed
unless
we
think
it
reasonable.
i
don't
know
any
case
like
that.
yes,
when
there
is
just
a
general
grant
of
discretion,
it
has
to
be
exercised
reasonably.
but
maybe
justice
breyer
knows
such
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
it
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
it
do
so?
doesn't
the
question
come
down
to
this
--
maybe
you
can
answer
this
yes.
but
--
but
isn't
the
question
simply:
is
it
conceivable
to
you,
as
it
was
evidently
not
to
congress,
that
any
state
would
turn
down
this
offer,
that
they
can't
refuse?
is
it
conceivable
to
you
that
any
state
would
have
said
no
to
this
program?
congress
didn't
think
that,
because
some
of
its
other
provisions
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
every
single
state
will
be
in
this
thing.
now,
do
you
--
can
you
conceive
of
a
state
saying
no?
and
--
and
if
you
can't,
that
sounds
like
coercion
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
do
you
predict?
if
you
predict
the
same,
that
100
percent
of
the
states
will
accept
it,
that
sounds
like
coercion.
justice
antonin
scalia
they'd
have
to
bail
out
of
medicaid,
you're
talking
about.
not
just
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
option.
