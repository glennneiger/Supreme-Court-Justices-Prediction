mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
question
whether
the
anti-injunction
act
is
jurisdictional.
justice
ginsburg,
for
reasons
you
suggested,
we
think
the
text
of
the
anti-injunction
act
is
indistinguishable
from
the
text
of
the
statute
that
was
unanimously
held
to
be
non-jurisdictional
in
reed
elsevier.
that
statute
said
no
suit
shall
be
instituted.
this
statute
says
no
suit
shall
be
maintained.
no--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--unless
the
copyright
is
registered.
and
this
goes
--
this
goes
to
the
character
of
the
lawsuit.
the
statute
in
reed
elsevier
says,
register
your
copyright
and
then
come
back
to
court.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it
--
it's
a
precondition
to
filing
suit.
the
--
the
analogous
precondition
here
is
pay
your
taxes
and
then
come
back
to
court.
the
point
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--it
--
it
has
to
be
the
same
challenge,
justice
sotomayor,
or
else
south
carolina
v.
regan
would
say
the
anti-injunction
act
doesn't
apply.
you
are
right
that
once
you
file
--
once
you
pay
your
taxes
and
then
file
the
refund
action,
the
act
of
filing
the
taxes
converts
the
suit
from
one
seeking
prospective
relief
and
to
one
seeking
money
damages.
and
in
that
sense,
you
could
think
of
the
statute
as
a
remedial
limitation
on
the
courts.
but
whether
you
think
of
it
as
an
exhaustion
requirement
or
a
remedial
limitation,
neither
of
those
characterizations
is
jurisdictional.
in
davis
v.
passman
you
said
that
a
remedial
limitation
doesn't
go--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--the
suit
is
being
delayed,
i
think
is
the
right
way
of
looking
at
it.
the
jurisdictional
apparatus
in
the
district
court
is
present.
prospective
relief
under
1331,
money
damages
action
under
1346.
if
the
anti-injunction
act
were
jurisdiction-ousting,
one
might
have
expected
it
to
be
in
title
28
and
to
qualify
those
statutes
and
the
to
use
jurisdictional
limits.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
gonzalez
--
gonzalez
v.
thaler
rests
on
a
special
rule
that
applies
with
respect
to
appeals
from
one
article
iii
court
to
another.
that's
--
that
explains
gonzalez
and
it
explains
bowles
before
it.
you
have
five
unanimous
opinions
in
the
last
decade
in
which
you
have
strongly
gone
the
other
direction
on
what
counts
as
jurisdictional.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
no,
you
came
very
close.
in
henderson,
justice
sotomayor,
you
said
that
bowles,
which
is
akin
to
thaler
is
explained
by
the
special
rules
and
understandings
governing
appeals
from
one
article
iii
court
to
another.
and
you
specifically
said
that
it
does
not
apply
to
situations
involving
a
party
seeking
initial
judicial
review
of
agency
action,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
so
while
you're
right,
the
text
in
bowles
and
thaler
are
not
terribly
different,
those
cases
are
explained
by
that
principle.
under
henderson
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
case.
the
text
in
this
case
speaks
to
the
suit,
the
cause
of
action
of
the
litigant.
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
jurisdiction
or
power
of
the
court.
the
anti-injunction
act
is
placed
in
a
section
of
the
tax
code
governing
procedure.
it's
not
placed
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--you
did
rely
on
that
in
reed
elsevier
as
one
consideration.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
and
another
--
another
consideration
in
reed
elsevier
that
cuts
in
our
favor
is
the
presence
of
exceptions.
you
said
three
in
reed
elsevier
cut
against
jurisdictional
characterization.
here
there
are
11.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--well,
some
of
them
have
no
jurisdictional
language
at
all,
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
uses
the
word
"jurisdiction"
to
describe
the
ability
of
the
court
to
restrain
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes,
which
is
what
one
would
have
expected--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
justice
breyer,
as
to
reasoning,
you
--
you
give
an
argument
--
you
give
an
argument
why
as
a
policy
matter
it
might
make
sense
to
have
a
non-jurisdictional
statute.
but
of
course
this
court's
recent
cases
time
and
again
say
congress
has
to
clearly
rank
the
statute
as
non-jurisdictional
in
its
text
and
structure.
it
seems
to
me
a
general
appeal
to
statutory
policies
doesn't
speak
with
sufficient
clarity--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--as
to
policy
--
as
to
policy
i
think
helvering
against
davis
is
the
refutation
of
this
view.
it
is
true
that
in
most
cases
the
government
doesn't
want
and
congress
doesn't
want
people
coming
into
court.
but
davis
shows
there
may
be
some
cases
including,
for
instance,
constitutional
challenges
to
landmark
federal
statutes
where
the
government
sensibly
decides
that
its
revenue-raising
purposes
are
better
served
by
allowing
a
party
to
come
into
court
and
waiving
its
defense.
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
did
in
davis,
and
this
court
accepted
that
waiver.
as
for
prior
cases,
we
have
the
holding
in
davis
and
the
holding
in
all
of
the
equitable
exception
cases
like
williams
packing.
the
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--you
have
used--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--it's
jurisdictional
except
when
the
solicitor
general
waives
it?
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms.
all
of
your
cases
analyze
the
situation
as
if
the
statute
is
jurisdictional,
then
it's
not
subject
to
waiver.
if
you
were
to
construe
this
as
such
a
one-of
unique
statute,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
still
win
because
the
solicitor
general
with
full
knowledge
of
the
anti-injunction
act
argument
available
to
him
affirmatively
gave
it
up.
this
is
not
just
a
forfeiture
where
a
government
lawyer
is
--
through
inadvertence
fails
to
raise
an
argument.
this
is
a
case
where
the
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--they
made
it
below.
they
know
what
it
is;
and
not
only
are
they
not
pursuing
it
here,
they
are
affirmatively
pursuing
an
argument
on
the
other
side.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
wouldn't
go
quite
that
far.
i
think
at
a
minimum
it
has
--
it
has
to
either
say
that
or
at
least
be
directed
to
the
courts
which
is
a
formulation
you
have
used
in
your
cases
and
which
is
the
formulation
that
congress
used
in
the
tax
injunction
act
but
did
not
use
in
this
statute.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kagan,
because
we
--
we
have
an
adversarial
system,
not
an
inquisitorial
one.
the
parties
maintain
their
lawsuits
i
think
is
the
more
natural
way
of
thinking
of
it.
if
i
could
turn
--
if
i
could
turn
to
the
merits
question
on
the
aia
before
my
time
runs
out.
the
purpose
of
this
lawsuit
is
to
challenge
a
requirement
--
a
federal
requirement
to
buy
health
insurance.
that
requirement
itself
is
not
a
tax.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
we
think
the
anti-injunction
act
doesn't
apply.
what
the
amicus
effectively
seeks
to
do
is
extend
the
anti-injunction
act,
not
just
to
taxes
which
is
how
the
statute
is
written,
but
to
free-standing
nontax
legal
duties.
and
it's
just--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--of
taxes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it's
entirely
separate,
and
let
me
explain
to
you
why.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i'm
not
sure
the
answer
is
nothing,
but
even
assuming
it
were
nothing,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
what
the
law
requires
and
what
enforcement
consequences
happen
to
you.
this
statute
was
very
deliberately
written
to
separate
mandate
from
penalty
in
several
different
ways.
they
are
put
in
separate
sections.
the
mandate
is
described
as
a
20
times,
three
times
in
the
operative
text
and
17
times
in
the
findings.
it's
imposed
through
use
of
a
mandatory
verb
"shall".
the
requirement
is
very
well
defined
in
the
statute,
so
it
can't
be
sloughed
off
as
a
general
exhortation,
and
it's
backed
up
by
a
penalty.
congress
then
separated
out
mandate
exceptions
from
penalty
exceptions.
it
defined
one
category
of
people
not
subject
to
the
mandate.
one
would
think
those
are
the
category
of
people
as
to
whom
congress
is
saying:
you
need
not
follow
this
law.
it
then
defined
a
separate
category
of
people
not
subject
to
the
penalty,
but
subject
to
the
mandate.
i
don't
know
what
that
could
mean
other
than--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--because
congress
reasonably
could
think
that
at
least
some
people
will
follow
the
law
precisely
because
it
is
the
law.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
one
category
of
person
that
might
be
--
the
very
poor,
who
are
exempt
from
the
penalty
but
subject
to
the
mandate.
mr.
long
says
this
must
be
a
mandate
exemption
because
it
would
be
wholly
harsh
and
unreasonable
for
congress
to
expect
people
who
are
very
poor
to
comply
with
the
requirement
to
obtain
health
insurance
when
they
have
no
means
of
doing
so.
that
gets
things
exactly
backwards.
the
very
poor
are
the
people
congress
would
be
most
concerned
about
with
respect
to
the
mandate
to
the
extent
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
mandate
is
to
prevent
emergency
room
cost
shifting
when
people
receive
uncompensated
care.
so
they
would
have
had
very
good
reason
to
make
the
very
poor
subject
to
the
mandate,
and
then
they
didn't
do
it
in
a
draconian
way;
they
gave
the
very
poor
a
means
of
complying
with
the
insurance
mandate,
and
that
is
through
the
medicaid
system.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
yes,
i
think
that
person
would,
because
that
person
is
injured
by
compliance
with
the
mandate.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
the
injury
--
when
that
person
is
subject
to
the
mandate,
that
person
is
required
to
purchase
health
insurance.
that
is
a
forced
acquisition
of
an
unwanted
good.
it's
a
classic
pocketbook
injury.
but
even
if
i'm
wrong
about
that
question,
justice
kagan,
the
question
of
who
has
standing
to
bring
the
challenge
that
we
seek
to
bring
seems
to
me
very
different
--
your
hypothetical
plaintiff
is
very
different
from
the
actual
plaintiffs.
we
have
individuals
who
are
planning
for
compliance
in
order
to
avoid
a
penalty,
which
is
what
their
affidavits
say.
and
we
have
the
states,
who
will
be
subject
no
doubt
to
all
sorts
of
adverse
ramifications
if
they
refuse
to
enroll
in
medicaid
the
people
who
are
forced
into
medicaid
by
virtue
of
the
mandate.
so
we
don't
have
the
problem
of
no
adverse
consequences
in
the
case.
and
then,
we
have
the
separate
distinction
between
the
question
of
who
has
article
iii
standing
in
order
to
maintain
a
suit
and
the
question
of
who
is
subject
to
a
legal
obligation.
and
you've
said
in
your
cases
that
even
if
there
may
be
no
one
who
has
standing
to
challenge
a
legal
obligation
like
the
incompatibility
clause
or
something,
that
doesn't
somehow
convert
the
legal
obligation
into
a
legal
nullity.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
states,
even
if
we
are
wrong
about
everything
i've
said
so
far,
the
states
clearly
fall
within
the
exception
recognized
in
south
carolina
v.
regan.
they
are
injured
by
the
mandate
because
the
mandate
forces
6
million
new
people
onto
their
medicaid
rolls.
but
they
are
not
directly
subject
to
the
mandate,
nor
could
they
violate
the
mandate
and
incur
a
penalty.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it's
people
who
will
enroll,
people
who
wouldn't
have
enrolled
had
they
been
given
a
voluntary
choice.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
that's
the
largest
category.
i
think
there
could
be
future
eligibles
who
would
enroll
because
they
are
subject
to
a
legal
obligation
but
wouldn't
have
enrolled
if
given
a
voluntary
choice.
but
i'm
happy
to
--
i'm
happy
to
focus
on
currently
eligible
people
who
haven't
enrolled
in
medicaid.
that
particular
class
is
the
one
that
gives
rise
to,
simply
in
florida
alone,
a
pocketbook
injury
on
the
order
of
500
to
$600
million
per
year.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
they
--
they
could,
but
they
don't.
what
the
state
wants
to
do
is
make
medicaid
available
to
all
who
are
eligible
and
choose
to
obtain
it.
and
in
any
event--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--i
--
i
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg.
all
i
know
is
that
the
difference
between
current
enrollees
and
people
who
could
enroll
but
have
not
is,
as
i
said,
on
the
--
is
a
$600
million
delta.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--it's
possible,
but
all
we're
talking
about
right
now
is
the
standing
of
the
states.
and
the
only
arguments
made
against
the
standing
of
the
states
--
i
mean,
there
is
a
classic
pocketbook
injury
here.
the
only
arguments
made
about
--
against
the
standing
of
the
states
are
number
one,
this
results
from
third-party
actions.
that
doesn't
work,
because
the
third-party
actions
are
not
unfettered
in
--
in
the
sense
of
lujan;
they
are
coerced
in
the
sense
of
bennett
v.
spear.
those
people
are
enrolling
because
they
are
under
a
legal
obligation
to
do
so.
the
second
argument
made
against
the
states'
standing
is
that
the
states
somehow
forfeit
their
ability
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
federal
law
because
they
voluntarily
choose
to
participate--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
the
--
the
principal
theory
for
state
standing
is
the
states
are
challenging
the
mandate
because
the
mandate
injures
them
when
people
are
forced
to
enroll
in
medicaid.
now,
it
is
true
they
are
not
directly
subject
to
the
mandate,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--okay.
let
me
--
let
me
try
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--let
me
try
it
this
way
--
may
i
finish
the
thought?
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
in
south
carolina
v.
regan,
the
state
was
not
subject
to
the
tax
at
issue.
the
state
was
harmed
because
--
as
the
issuer
of
the
bonds,
and
the
bond
holders
were
the
ones
subject
to
the
tax.
so
the
state
is
injured
not
because
it
is
the
direct
object
of
the
federal
tax,
but
because
of
its
relationship
to
the
regulated
party
as
issuer/bond
holder.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
