justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
--
why
will
the
administrative
remedies
rule
not
be
applicable
--
exhaustion
rule
not
be
applicable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
courts
apply
the
exhaustion
rule.
i
mean,
i
know
you've
studied
this.
i'm
just
not
following
it.
why
couldn't
the
court
say
well,
you
haven't
exhausted
your
remedies,
no
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
easier
to
talk
about
this
case
if
we
just
forget
the
words
"for
the
purpose
of
restraining
assessment
and
collection.
"
in
a
sense,
that
brings
the
jurisdictional
question
and
justice
breyer's
question
together.
it
seems
to
me
--
maybe
you
could
just
comment
on
that
language.
is
that
sort
of
language
usually
contained
in
a
jurisdictional
provision?
i
mean,
you
often
don't
know
the
purpose
of
a
suit
until
after
the
thing
is
underway.
i
can
see
it
with
malicious
prosecution
and
some
civil
rights
cases.
does
it
strike
you
as
somewhat
unusual
to
have
this
provision
in
a
jurisdictional
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
is
correct,
although
in
the
refund
context,
you
have
the
sovereign
immunity
problem,
in
which
we
presume
that
has
not
been
waived.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
7421(a)
--
were
the
same--
--the
language
is
quite
parallel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
want
to
know
the
answer?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
you
indicated
--
there
was
a
discussion
earlier
about
why
does
the
government
really
care,
they
have
competent
attorneys,
et
cetera.
but
--
and
you
began
your
argument
by
saying
it
would
be
very
troubling
to
say
that
it's
not
jurisdictional.
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
that
--
it's
not
for
us
to
tell
a
party
what's
in
its
best
interests.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
might
be
some
instances
in
which
the
government
would
want
to
litigate
the
validity
of
a
tax
right
away
and
would
want
to
waive.
but
you
say
it's
--
that's
not
true;
that
it's
very
troubling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
create
commerce
in
order
to
regulate
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
help
--
help
me
with
this.
assume
for
the
moment
--
you
may
disagree.
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
is
unprecedented,
this
is
a
step
beyond
what
our
cases
have
allowed,
the
affirmative
duty
to
act
to
go
into
commerce.
if
that
is
so,
do
you
not
have
a
heavy
burden
of
justification?
i
understand
that
we
must
presume
laws
are
constitutional,
but,
even
so,
when
you
are
changing
the
relation
of
the
individual
to
the
government
in
this,
what
we
can
stipulate
is,
i
think,
a
unique
way,
do
you
not
have
a
heavy
burden
of
justification
to
show
authorization
under
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
your
question
is
whether
or
not
there
are
any
limits
on
the
commerce
clause.
can
you
identify
for
us
some
limits
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
not?
if
congress
--
if
congress
says
that
the
interstate
commerce
is
affected,
isn't,
according
to
your
view,
that
the
end
of
the
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
which
way
it
cuts.
if
the
congress
has
alternate
means,
let's
assume
it
can
use
the
tax
power
to
raise
revenue
and
to
just
have
a
national
health
service,
single
payer.
how
does
that
factor
into
our
analysis?
in
the
one
sense,
it
can
be
argued
that
this
is
what
the
government
is
doing;
it
ought
to
be
honest
about
the
power
that
it's
using
and
use
the
correct
power.
on
the
other
hand,
it
means
that
since
the
court
can
do
it
anyway
--
congress
can
do
it
anyway,
we
give
a
certain
amount
of
latitude.
i'm
not
sure
which
the
way
the
argument
goes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
reason,
the
reason
this
is
concerning,
is
because
it
requires
the
individual
to
do
an
affirmative
act.
in
the
law
of
torts
our
tradition,
our
law,
has
been
that
you
don't
have
the
duty
to
rescue
someone
if
that
person
is
in
danger.
the
blind
man
is
walking
in
front
of
a
car
and
you
do
not
have
a
duty
to
stop
him
absent
some
relation
between
you.
and
there
is
some
severe
moral
criticisms
of
that
rule,
but
that's
generally
the
rule.
and
here
the
government
is
saying
that
the
federal
government
has
a
duty
to
tell
the
individual
citizen
that
it
must
act,
and
that
is
different
from
what
we
have
in
previous
cases
and
that
changes
the
relationship
of
the
federal
government
to
the
individual
in
a
very
fundamental
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
government's
argument
this
--
and
maybe
i
won't
state
it
accurately
--
it
is
true
that
the
noninsured
young
adult
is,
in
fact,
an
actuarial
reality
insofar
as
our
allocation
of
health
services,
insofar
as
the
way
health
insurance
companies
figure
risks?
that
person
who
is
sitting
at
home
in
his
or
her
living
room
doing
nothing
is
an
actuarial
reality
that
can
and
must
be
measured
for
health
service
purposes;
is
that
their
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
are
in
the
market
in
the
sense
that
they
are
creating
a
risk
that
the
market
must
account
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
that's
what's
happening
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
government
tells
us
that's
because
the
insurance
market
is
unique.
and
in
the
next
case,
it'll
say
the
next
market
is
unique.
but
i
think
it
is
true
that
if
most
questions
in
life
are
matters
of
degree,
in
the
insurance
and
health
care
world,
both
markets
--
stipulate
two
markets
--
the
young
person
who
is
uninsured
is
uniquely
proximately
very
close
to
affecting
the
rates
of
insurance
and
the
costs
of
providing
medical
care
in
a
way
that
is
not
true
in
other
industries.
that's
my
concern
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
still
not
sure,
what
is
the
test
--
and
this
was
the
colloquy
you
had
with
justice
scalia
with
the
corn
husker
hypothetical.
so
i
need
to
know
what
standard
you
are
asking
me
to
apply.
is
it
whether
as
a
rational
matter
separate
parts
could
still
function,
or
does
it
focus
on
the
intent
of
the
congress?
if
you
--
suppose
you
had
party
a
wants
proposal
number
1,
party
b
wants
proposal
number
2.
completely
unrelated.
one
is
airline
rates,
the
other
is
milk
regulation.
and
we
--
and
they
decide
them
together.
the
procedural
rules
are
these
have
to
be
voted
on
as
one.
they
are
both
passed.
then
one
is
declared
unconstitutional.
the
other
can
operate
completely
independently.
now,
we
know
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
to
pass
one
without
the
other.
is
that
the
end
of
it,
or
is
there
some
different
test?
because
we
don't
want
to
go
into
legislative
history,
that's
intrusive,
so
we
ask
whether
or
not
an
objective
--
as
an
objective
rational
matter
one
could
function
without
--
i
still
don't
know
what
the
test
is
that
we
are
supposed
to
apply.
and
this
is
the
same
question
as
justice
scalia
asked.
could
you
give
me
some
help
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
which
one
--
and
what
test
do
you
suggest
that
we
follow
if
we
want
to
clarify
our
jurisprudence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
objective
test
is
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there's
no
article
iii
jurisdictional
problem
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
that
this
is
a
remedial
exercise
of
the
court's
power
to
explain
the
consequences
of
its
judgment
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
restraint--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you
say
judicial
restraint,
you
are
echoing
the
earlier
premise
that
it
increases
the
judicial
power
if
the
judiciary
strikes
down
other
provisions
of
the
act.
i
suggest
to
you
it
might
be
quite
the
opposite.
we
would
be
exercising
the
judicial
power
if
one
act
was
--
one
provision
was
stricken
and
the
others
remained
to
impose
a
risk
on
insurance
companies
that
congress
had
never
intended.
by
reason
of
this
court,
we
would
have
a
new
regime
that
congress
did
not
provide
for,
did
not
consider.
that,
it
seems
to
me
can
be
argued
at
least
to
be
a
more
extreme
exercise
of
judicial
power
than
to
strike
--
than
striking
the
whole.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
accept
the
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
don't
understand
where
you
are
with
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question.
assume
that
there
is
a,
a
substantial
probability
that
the
350
billion
plus
350
billion
equals
7
is
going
to
be
cut
in
half
if
the
individual
mandate
is
--
is
stricken.
assume
there
is
a
significant
possibility
of
that.
is
it
within
the
proper
exercise
of
this
court's
function
to
impose
that
kind
of
risk?
can
we
say
that
the
congress
would
have
intended
that
there
be
that
kind
of
risk?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
point
then,
why
we
should
just
assume
that
it
is
not
severable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
--
if
we
lack
the
competence
to
even
assess
whether
there
is
a
risk,
then
isn't
this
an
awesome
exercise
of
judicial
power?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
say
we
are
doing
something
and
we
are
not
telling
you
what
the
consequences
might
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
quite
understand
about
the
employers.
you're
--
you
are
saying
congress
mandated
employers
to
buy
something
that
congress
itself
has
not
contemplated?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
cost
of
those
policies
would
be
lowered
by
--
by
certain
provisions
which
are
by
hypothesis
--
we
are
not
sure
--
by
hypothesis
are
in
doubt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
saying
we
have
--
we
have
the
expertise
to
make
the
inquiry
you
want
us
to
make,
i.e.,
the
guaranteed-issue,
but
not
the
expertise
that
justice
alito's
question
suggests
we
must
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
understand
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
saying
we
have
concluded
that
there
is
an
insignificant
risk
of
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
the
insurance
companies,
that's
our
economic
conclusion,
and
therefore
not
severable?
that's
what
you
want
me
to
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
real
congress
or
a
hypothetical
congress?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
"the
statute
is
your
money
and
your
life.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
inevitable
consequence
of
your
position
was
that
the
federal
government
could
just
do
this
on
its
own,
the
federal
government
could
have
medicaid,
medicare,
and
these
insurance
regulations.
assume
that's
true.
then
how
are
the
interests
of
federalism
concerned?
how
are
the
interests
of
federalism
concerned
if
in
florida
or
texas
or
some
other
objecting
states
there
are
huge
federal
bureaucracies
doing
what
this
bill
allows
the
state
bureaucracies
to
do.
i
know
you
have
thought
about
that.
i
would
just
like
your
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
just
a
small
point,
and
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
it
--
does
this
act
not
require
states
to
keep
at
the
present
level
their
existing
medicaid
expenditure?
so
some
states
may
have
been
more
generous
than
others
in
medicaid,
but
this
act
freezes
that
so
the
states
can't
go
back.
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
one
test
could
be
--
i
just
don't
see
that
it
would
be
very
workable
--
is
whether
or
not
it's
so
big
that
accountability
is
lost,
that
it
is
not
clear
to
the
citizens
that
the
state
or
the
federal
government
is
administering
the
program,
even
though
it's
a
state
administrator.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
unworkable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
does
federalism
require
that
there
be
a
relatively
clear
line
of
accountability
for
political
acts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
subsumed
in
the
coercion
test,
or
is
that
an
independent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
think
that
there
still
is
inherent
and
implicit
in
the
idea
of
federalism,
necessary
for
the
idea
of
federalism,
that
there
be
a
clear
line
of
accountability
so
the
citizen
knows
that
it's
the
federal
or
the
state
government
who
should
be
held
responsible
for
a
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
coercion
relate
to
that,
or
is
that
a
separate--
38433763845959
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
a
separate
thought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
think
the
answer
would
be
that
the
state
wants
to
preserve
its
integrity,
its
identity,
its
responsibility
in
the
federal
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
but
the
point
is
--
but
the
--
the
point
is,
there's
--
there's
no
real--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
no
real
--
there's
no
realistic
choice.
there's
no
real
choice.
and
congress
does
not
in
effect
allow
for
an
out
--
opt
out.
we
just
know
that.
and
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
substantial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
recognize
the
problem
with
that
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
they're
now
frozen
in,
per
our
earlier
discussions,
to
a
large
extent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
they
have
to
do
so
by
hiring
a
very
substantial
number
of
more
employees.
there
will
be
state
employees.
there'll
be
substantial
state
administrative
expenses
that
are
not
reimbursed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated,
justices
scalia,
thomas,
alito
and
i
have
written
a
joint
dissent.
in
our
view,
the
act
before
us
is
invalid
in
its
entirety.
the
joint
dissent
is
organized
this
way.
first,
it
considers
the
constitutionality
of
the
individual
mandate
and
that,
of
course,
requires
a
discussion
whether
the
mandate
can
be
sustained
as
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
or
as
an
exercise
of
its
power
to
tax.
second,
the
joint
dissent
considers
the
constitutionality
of
the
expansion
of
medicaid
in
light
of
the
argument
that
it
coerces
states
to
surrender
the
power
that
must
be
vested
in
them
under
principles
of
federalism.
third,
the
joint
dissent
considers
the
question
whether
the
act's
other
provisions
can
be
preserved
if
the
mandate
in
medicare
--
medicaid
expansion
are
unconstitutional,
first
the
individual
mandate.
now
the
statute
requires
a
defined
class
of
individuals
to
purchase
health
insurance.
this
mandate
is
first
defended
by
the
government
as
an
exercise
of
congress'
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
is
true
that
if
an
individual
does
not
purchase
insurance,
he
or
she
affects
the
insurance
market
to
a
degree.
but
the
government's
theory
would
make
one's
mere
existence,
the
basis
for
federal
regulation.
there
would
been
no
structural
limit
on
the
power
of
congress.
as
a
result,
the
government's
theory
would
change
the
relation
between
the
citizen
and
the
federal
government
in
a
fundamental
way.
we
cannot
accept
the
government's
theory.
there
are
structural
limits
upon
congress'
powers.
in
other
words,
there
are
some
things
the
federal
government
cannot
do
and
that
clear
principle
carries
the
day
here.
it
requires
us
to
conclude
that
congress'
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
does
not
give
at
the
authority
to
enact
the
individual
mandate.
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
five
justices,
the
chief
justice
and
the
four
members
of
this
joint
dissent.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
congress
exceeded
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
when
it
passed
the
individual
mandate,
the
majority
of
the
court
holds
that
the
individual
mandate,
if
it's
recast
as
a
tax,
is
--
is
constitutional.
the
court
unanimously
concludes
that
the
individual
mandate
is
not
a
tax
under
the
anti-injunction
act
but
five
members
of
the
court
then
pivot
and
hold
that
the
individual
mandate
is
a
tax
for
constitutional
purposes.
and
to
do
this,
the
majority
rewrites
the
statute
congress
wrote,
we
disagree.
the
act
requires
a
purchase
of
health
insurance
and
punishes
violation
of
that
mandate
with
a
penalty.
but
what
congress
has
called
a
penalty,
the
court
calls
a
tax.
what
congress
called
a
requirement,
the
court
calls
an
option.
and
where
congress
mandates
that
the
person
shall
obtain
insurance,
the
court
says
he
may
but
need
not
obtain
insurance.
in
short,
the
court
imposes
a
tax
when
congress
deliberately
rejected
a
tax.
judicial
tax-writing
is
particularly
troubling
as
a
usurpation
of
the
legislative
rule.
it
places
the
power
to
tax
in
the
branch
of
the
government
least
accountable
to
the
citizenry,
but
the
constitution
requires
taxes
to
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives,
the
legislative
body
most
accountable
to
the
people.
there,
elected
officials
must
weigh
the
need
for
the
tax
against
the
terrible
price
they
might
pay
at
their
next
election.
imposing
a
tax
through
judicial
legislation
inverts
the
constitutional
scheme.
in
the
case
of
the
affordable
care
act,
congress
went
to
great
lengths
to
structure
the
mandate
as
a
penalty
not
a
tax,
but
the
majority
now
says
that
it
is
a
tax,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
sustaining
it
but
will
not
for
the
purpose
of
jurisdiction.
as
to
the
medicaid
expansion,
the
second
part
of
this
joint
dissent
considers
the
medicaid
expansion.
the
expansion
provides
new
funds
to
the
states
for
medicaid.
its
whole
design
is
to
threaten
withdrawal
of
all
of
the
states'
federal
funding
for
medicaid
if
the
state
does
not
comply
with
the
expansion
directive.
now,
in
--
in
so
doing,
the
medicaid
expansion
leave
states
with
no
realistic
choice
but
to
expand
medicaid
and
to
participate
in
the
expanded
program.
it
coerces
them
into
administering
a
federal
program
against
their
will.
that
blurs
the
line
of
political
accountability
between
the
states
and
their
citizens.
the
coercion
effected
by
the
statute
is
a
violation
of
state
sovereignty
and
on
this
threshold
question
of
coercion,
seven
justices
agree.
three
justices,
however,
devise
a
remedy.
that,
again,
in
effect,
rewrites
the
statute
and
changes
its
design.
and
in
a
separate
opinion
by
justice
ginsburg,
joined
by
justice
sotomayor,
these
two
other
justices
conclude
that
the
medicaid
expansion
is
valid
as
written
but
in
view
of
the
disposition
of
the
chief
justice,
they
then
agree
with
the
remedy
he
adopts.
this
joint
dissent
disagrees.
we
find
no
judicial
authority
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
permit
this
remedy.
the
design
of
the
court's
remedy,
contrary
to
the
statute
congress
enacted,
is
to
bar
the
federal
government
from
withdrawing
all
preexisting
medicaid
funding
if
a
state
elects
not
to
participate
in
the
medicaid
expansion.
once
the
specifics
of
today's
ruling
are
understood,
it
will
be
apparent
that
the
affordable
care
act
now
must
operate
as
the
court
has
revised
it,
not
as
congress
has
designed
it
and
the
consequences
of
that
result
are
as
follows
-
the
court
offers
states
a
choice,
where
congress
one
of
them,
to
have
no
choice
and
to
make
matters
worst,
the
choice
the
court
offers
may
be
illusory.
that
is
because
even
if
a
state
elects
not
to
accept
the
expansion,
its
citizens
are
still
subject
to
the
individual
mandate,
now
recast
as
a
tax,
but
now,
in
those
states
the
cost
of
the
insurance
that
must
be
purchased
may
well
be
for
hire
for
insurance
companies
have
no
medicaid
expansion
to
help
defray
the
cost
of
insuring
unhealthy
individuals
at
unprofitable
rates.
this
distorted
version
of
the
act
is
now
decreed
by
the
court
and
no
one
else.
it
is
the
position
of
the
joint
dissent
that
the
medicaid
expansion
cannot
be
saved
in
this
way
and
that
the
expansion
must
be
declared
invalid.
the
third
and
final
part
of
our
joint
dissent
considers
severability,
what
to
do
with
the
remainder
of
the
act
if
the
individual
mandate
and
the
medicaid
expansion
are
unconstitutional.
in
our
view,
both
those
provisions
are
essential
to
the
act's
design
and
operation
and
all
the
act's
other
provisions
would
not
have
been
enacted
without
them.
it
must
follow
that
the
entire
statute
is
linked
together
and
without
the
mandate
and
medicaid
expansion,
the
entire
act
is
inoperative.
now,
the
joint
dissent
addresses
at
some
length
the
question
of
severability
for
two
reasons.
first,
it's
necessary
for
us
to
address
severability
in
order
to
support
the
conclusion
that,
in
our
view,
the
act
is
invalid
in
its
entirety.
second,
our
analysis
of
the
act's
many
interdependencies
gives
further
support
for
our
conclusion
that
the
court's
medicaid
remedy
is
itself
inconsistent
with
the
act.
the
analysis
in
the
severability
part
of
the
joint
dissent
makes
clear
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
to
force
on
the
nation
a
new
act
so
that
the
health
care
system
is
now
governed
by
what
the
court
has
said,
not
what
the
congress
has
said.
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
court's
approach
to
the
case
is
this.
it
says
the
statute
congress
did
not
write.
the
court
regards
its
strained
statutory
interpretation
as
judicial
modesty.
it
is
not.
it
amounts
instead
to
a
vast
judicial
overreaching.
it
creates
a
debilitated,
inoperable
version
of
health
care
regulation
that
congress
did
not
act
and
the
public
does
not
expect.
the
court's
disposition
invented
in
a
textual
as
it
is
does
not
even
have
the
merit
of
avoiding
constitutional
difficulties,
it
creates
them.
the
judgment
on
the
medicaid
expansion
issue
ushers
in
new
federalism
concerns
and
place
--
places
an
unaccustomed
strain
upon
the
union.
those
states
that
decline
the
medicaid
expansion
must
subsidize
by
the
federal
tax
dollars
taken
from
their
citizens,
vast
grants
to
the
states
that
accept
the
medicaid
expansion.
if
that
destabilizing
political
dynamic,
so
antagonistic
to
a
harmonious
union,
is
to
be
introduced
at
all,
it
should
be
by
congress,
not
by
the
judiciary.
the
values
that
should
have
determined
our
course
today
are
caution,
minimalism
and
the
understanding
that
the
federal
government
is
one
of
limited
powers,
but
the
court's
ruling
undermines
these
values
at
every
turn.
in
the
name
of
restraint,
it
overreaches.
in
the
name
of
constitutional
avoidance,
it
creates
new
constitutional
questions.
in
the
name
of
cooperative
federalism,
it
undermines
state
sovereignty.
we
must
submit,
with
due
respect,
that
today's
decision
somehow
overlooks
this
court's
historic
rule
and
responsibility
to
teach,
to
--
to
confirm,
to
insist
upon
this
proposition.
the
constitution,
though
it
dates
from
the
founding
of
the
republic,
does
and
always
must
have
powerful
meaning
and
vital
relevance
in
the
context
of
our
own
times.
this
case
presents
real
questions
regarding
the
structure
of
the
constitution.
some
may
think
a
case
concerning
constitutional
structure
with
issues
concerning
checks
and
balances,
separation
of
powers
and
federalism
is
somehow
have
lesser
importance
or
priority
in
a
case
concerning
liberties
guaranteed
in
the
bill
of
rights
or
the
civil
war
amendments,
but
structure
means
liberty.
for
without
structure,
there
are
insufficient
means
to
hold
to
account
a
central
government
that
exceeds
its
powers
in
controlling
the
lives
of
its
citizens.
today's
decisions
should
have
vindicated,
not
ignored
these
precepts.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
find
the
act
invalid
in
its
entirety.
with
respect,
we
dissent.
