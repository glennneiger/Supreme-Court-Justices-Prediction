justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
congress
said
that
many
times,
but
is
there
any
case
in
which
the
result
would
have
been
different
if
the
anti-injunction
act
were
not
viewed
as
jurisdictional
but
instead
were
viewed
as
a
mandatory
claims
processing
--
rule?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
clearest
--
the
clearest
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
jurisdictional
provision
and
a
mandatory
claims
processing
rule
is
whether
it
can
be
waived
and
whether
the
court
feels
that
it
has
an
obligation
to
raise
the
issue
sua
sponte.
now,
if
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
call
it
jurisdictional,
but
none
of
them
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
anti-injunction
act
were
simply
a
mandatory
claims
processing
rule,
you
have
that
on
one
side.
and
on
the
other
side,
you
have
davis,
where
the
court
accepted
a
waiver
by
the
solicitor
general;
the
sunshine
anthracite
coal
case,
where
there
also
was
a
waiver;
and,
there's
the
williams
packing
case,
which
is
somewhat
hard
to
understand
as
viewing
the
anti-injunction
act
as
a
jurisdictional
provision.
the
court
said
that
there
could
be
a
suit
if
--
there
is
no
way
the
government
could
win,
and
the
plaintiff
would
suffer
irreparable
harm.
now,
doesn't
that
sound
like
an
equitable
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
say
they
want
to
obey
the
law,
and
they
say
that
your
argument
puts
them
in
the
position
of
having
to
disobey
the
law
in
order
to
obtain
review
of
their
claim.
and
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
take
us
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
"for
the
purpose
of"
language.
i
take
it
you
interpret
the
statute
to
mean
the
following:
"for
the
purpose
of"
means
having
the
effect
of.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
general
verrilli,
today
you
are
arguing
that
the
penalty
is
not
a
tax.
tomorrow
you
are
going
to
be
back
and
you
will
be
arguing
that
the
penalty
is
a
tax.
has
the
court
ever
held
that
something
that
is
a
tax
for
purposes
of
the
taxing
power
under
the
constitution
is
not
a
tax
under
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
sub-section
a
says
directly,
"an
applicable
individual
shall
ensure
that
the
individual
has
the
minimum
essential
coverage.
"
and
you
are
saying
it
doesn't
really
mean
that,
that
if
you're
not
subject
to
the
penalty,
you're
not
under
the
obligation
to
maintain
the
minimum
essential
coverage?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
a
person
who
has
been
receiving
medical
care
in
an
emergency
room
--
has
no
health
insurance
but,
over
the
years,
goes
to
the
emergency
room
when
the
person
wants
medical
care
--
goes
to
the
emergency
room,
and
the
hospital
says,
well,
fine,
you
are
eligible
for
medicaid,
enroll
in
medicaid.
and
the
person
says,
no,
i
don't
want
that.
i
want
to
continue
to
get
--
just
get
care
here
from
the
emergency
room.
will
the
hospital
be
able
to
point
to
the
mandate
and
say,
well,
you're
obligated
to
enroll?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
they
are
not
facing
the
tax
penalty.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
hospital
will
have
to
continue
to
give
them
care
and
pay
for
it
themselves,
and
not
require
them
to
be
enrolled
in
medicaid.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
will
they
be
able
to
take
this
out
and
say,
well,
you
really
should
--
you
have
a
moral
obligation
to
do
it;
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
said,
you
have
to
enroll?
no,
they
can't
say?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
after
this
takes
effect,
there
may
be
a
lot
of
people
who
are
assessed
the
penalty
and
disagree
either
with
whether
they
should
be
assessed
the
penalty
at
all,
or
with
the
calculation
of
the
amount
of
their
penalty.
so
under
your
interpretation
of
the
act,
all
of
them
can
now
go
to
court?
none
of
them
are
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
for
reasons
that
justice
kennedy,
i
think,
suggested
in
one
of
his
questions
to
mr.
long,
all
of
the
other
doctrines
that
are
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
related
doctrines
would
still
be
there.
the
united
states
would
rely
on
them
in
those
circumstances.
and
--
and
so,
i
don't
think
the
answer
is
that
they
can
all
go
to
court,
no.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
two
former
--
two
former
commissioners
of
the
irs
have
filed
a
brief
saying
that
your
interpretation
is
going
to
lead
to
a
flood
of
litigation.
are
they
wrong
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
there
is
a,
a
market
for
burial
services?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right,
suppose
that
you
and
i
walked
around
downtown
washington
at
lunch
hour
and
we
found
a
couple
of
healthy
young
people
and
we
stopped
them
and
we
said,
"you
know
what
you're
doing?
"
"you
are
financing
your
burial
services
right
now
because
eventually
you're
going
to
die,
and
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
pay
for
it,
and
if
you
don't
have
burial
insurance
and
you
haven't
saved
money
for
it,
you're
going
to
shift
the
cost
to
somebody
else.
"
isn't
that
a
very
artificial
way
of
talking
about
what
somebody
is
doing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
that's
true,
why
isn't
it
equally
artificial
to
say
that
somebody
who
is
doing
absolutely
nothing
about
health
care
is
financing
health
care
services?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
the
difference.
you
can
get
burial
insurance.
you
can
get
health
insurance.
most
people
are
going
to
need
health
care.
almost
everybody.
everybody
is
going
to
be
buried
or
cremated
at
some
point.
what's
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
here--
--sure
you
do,
because
if
you
don't
have
money
then
the
state
is
going
to
pay
for
it.
or
some
--
to
pay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
or
a
family
member
is
going--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--but
isn't
that
a
very
small
part
of
what
the
mandate
is
doing?
you
can
correct
me
if
these
figures
are
wrong,
but
it
appears
to
me
that
the
cbo
has
estimated
that
the
average
premium
for
a
single
insurance
policy
in
the
non-group
market
would
be
roughly
$5,800
in
--
in
2016.
respondents
--
the
economists
have
supported
--
the
respondents
estimate
that
a
young,
healthy
individual
targeted
by
the
mandate
on
average
consumes
about
$854
in
health
services
each
year.
so
the
mandate
is
forcing
these
people
to
provide
a
huge
subsidy
to
the
insurance
companies
for
other
purposes
that
the
act
wishes
to
serve,
but
isn't
--
if
those
figures
are
right,
isn't
it
the
case
that
what
this
mandate
is
really
doing
is
not
requiring
the
people
who
are
subject
to
it
to
pay
for
the
services
that
they
are
going
to
consume?
it
is
requiring
them
to
subsidize
services
that
will
be
received
by
somebody
else.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
denying
this?
if
you
took
the
group
of
people
who
are
subject
to
the
mandate
and
you
calculated
the
amount
of
health
care
services
this
whole
group
would
consume
and
figured
out
the
cost
of
an
insurance
policy
to
cover
the
services
that
group
would
consume,
the
cost
of
that
policy
would
be
much,
much
less
than
the
kind
of
policy
that
these
people
are
now
going
to
be
required
to
purchase
under
the
affordable
care
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
point
is
--
no,
you
take
into
account
that
some
people
in
that
group
are
going
to
be
hit
by
a
bus,
some
people
in
that
group
are
going
to
unexpectedly
contract
or
be
diagnosed
with
a
disease
that
--
that
is
very
expensive
to
treat.
but
if
you
take
their
costs
and
you
calculate
that,
that's
a
lot
less
than
the
amount
that
they
are
going
to
be
required
to
pay.
so
that
you
can't
just
justify
this
on
the
basis
of
their
trying
to
shift
their
costs
off
to
other
people,
can
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
just
--
before
you
move
on,
could
you
express
your
limiting
principle
as
succinctly
as
you
possibly
can?
congress
can
force
people
to
purchase
a
product
where
the
failure
to
purchase
the
product
has
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
--
if
what?
if
this
is
part
of
a
larger
regulatory
scheme?
was
that
it?
was
there
anything
more?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
the
--
can
the
mandate
be
viewed
as
tax
if
it
does
impose
a
requirement
on
people
who
are
not
subject
to
the
penalty
or
the
tax?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
carvin,
isn't
there
this
difference
between
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
and
the
law
that
we
have
before
us
here?
in
his
hypothetical
harm
to
other
people
from
the
communicable
disease
is
the
result
of
the
disease.
it
is
not
the
result
of
something
that
the
government
has
done,
whereas
here
the
reason
why
there
is
cost
shifting
is
because
the
government
has
mandated
that.
it
has
required
hospitals
to
provide
emergency
treatment,
and
instead
of
paying
for
that
through
a
tax
which
would
be
born
by
everybody,
it
has
required
--
it
has
set
up
a
system
in
which
the
cost
is
surreptitiously
shifted
to
people
who
have
health
insurance
and
who
pay
their
bills
when
they
go
to
the
hospital.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
they
are
drawing
a
line
between
commerce
and
everything
else
that
is
not
commerce
is
drawing
an
artificial
line,
drawing
a
line
between
congress
and
manufacturing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
can
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
clement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
your
fallback
position
be
if
--
if
we
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
if
the
mandate
is
declared
unconstitutional,
the
rest
of
the
act,
every
single
provision,
has
to
fall?
other
--
proposed
other
dispositions
have
been
proposed.
there's
the
solicitor
general's
disposition,
the
recommended
disposition
to
strike
down
the
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating
provisions.
one
of
the
--
one
amicus
says
strike
down
all
of
title
i,
another
one
says
strike
down
all
of
title
i
and
title
ii.
what
--
what
would
you
suggest?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
there
was
--
suppose
there
was
a
non-severability
provision
in
--
in
this
act.
if
one
provision
were
to
be
held
unconstitutional,
then
every
single
--
someone
would
have
to
bring
a
--
a
separate
lawsuit
challenging
every
single
other
provision
in
the
act
and
say,
well,
one
fell
and
the
congress
said
it's
all
--
it's
a
package,
it
can't
be
separated.
that's
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
about
the
argument
that
is
made
in
the
economists'
amicus
brief?
they
say
that
the
insurance
reforms
impose
10-year
costs
of
roughly
$700
billion
on
the
insurance
industry,
and
that
these
costs
are
supposed
to
be
offset
by
about
350
billion
in
new
revenue
from
the
individual
mandate
and
350
billion
from
the
medicaid
expansion.
now
if
the
350
billion
--
maybe
you
will
disagree
with
the
numbers,
that
they
are
fundamentally
wrong;
but
assuming
they
are
in
the
ballpark,
if
the
350
million
from
the
individual
mandate
were
to
be
lost,
what
would
happen
to
the
insurance
industry,
which
would
now
be
in
the
--
in
the
hole
for
$350
billion
over
10
years?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
true,
what
is
the
difference
between
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating
provisions
on
the
one
hand
and
other
provisions
that
increase
costs
substantially
for
insurance
companies?
for
example,
the
tax
on
high
cost
health
plans,
which
the
economists
in
the
amicus
brief
said
would
cost
$217
billion
over
10
years?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
a
factual
context.
let's
say
congress
says
this
to
the
states:
we
have
got
great
news
for
you;
we
know
your
expenditures
on
education
are
a
huge
financial
burden,
so
we
are
going
to
take
that
completely
off
your
shoulders;
we
are
going
to
impose
a
special
federal
education
tax
which
will
raise
exactly
the
same
amount
of
money
as
all
of
the
states
now
spend
on
education;
and
then
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
grant
that
is
equal
to
what
you
spent
on
education
last
year.
now,
this
is
a
great
offer
and
we
think
you
will
take
it,
but
of
course,
if
you
take
it,
it's
going
to
have
some
conditions
because
we
are
going
to
set
rules
on
teacher
tenure,
on
collective
bargaining,
on
curriculum,
on
textbooks,
class
size,
school
calendar
and
many
other
things.
so
take
it
or
leave
it.
if
you
take
it,
you
have
to
follow
our
rules
on
all
of
these
things.
if
you
leave
it,
well,
then
you
are
going
to
have
to
fine
--
you
are
going
to
have
to
tax
your
citizens,
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
the
federal
education
tax;
but
on
top
of
that,
you
were
going
to
have
to
tax
them
for
all
of
the
money
that
you
are
now
spending
on
education.
plus
all
of
the
federal
funds
that
you
were
previously
given.
would
that
be
--
would
that
reach
the
point
--
would
that
be
the
point
where
financial
inducement
turns
into
coercion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
might
be
right.
but
if
that
is
the
case
then
there
is
nothing
left.
27198812723016
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--of
federalism.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
this
discussion
realistic?
the
objective
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
to
provide
near
universal
health
care.
now
suppose
that
all
of
the
26
states
that
are
parties
to
this
case
were
to
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
abide
by
the
new
conditions.
then
there
would
be
a
huge
portion
--
a
big
portion
of
the
population
that
would
not
have
healthcare,
and
it's
a
realistic
possibility
the
secretary
is
going
to
say,
well,
okay,
fine,
you
know.
we
are
going
to
cut
off
your
new
funds
but
we
are
not
going
to
cut
off
your
old
funds
and
just
let
that
condition
sit
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
in
selling
this
argument
--
take
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
if
there
is
no
medicaid
program,
then
they're
not
going
to
get
health
care.
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
congress
obviously
assumed
--
it
thought
it
was
inconceivable
that
any
state
would
reject
this
offer,
because
the
objective
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
to
provide
near-universal
care.
and
medicaid
is
the
way
to
provide
care
for
at
least
the
poorest
of
the
poor.
so
it
--
it
just
didn't
occur
to
them
that
this
was
a
possibility.
and
when
--
when
that's
the
case,
how
can
that
not
be
coercion?
unless
it's
just
a
gift.
unless
it's
just
purely
a
gift.
then
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
whether
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
that
the
money
--
a
lot
of
the
money
to
pay
for
this
--
is
going
to
come
out
of
the
same
taxpayers
that
the
states
have
to
tax
to
get
their
money.
