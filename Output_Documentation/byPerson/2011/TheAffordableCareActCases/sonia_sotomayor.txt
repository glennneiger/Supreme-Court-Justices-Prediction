justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
long,
in
bowles,
the
court
looked
to
the
long
history
of
appellate
issues
as
being
jurisdictional,
in
its
traditional
sense,
not
as
a
claim
processing
rule,
but
as
a
pure
jurisdiction
rule,
the
power
of
the
court
to
hear
a
case.
from
all
the
questions
here,
i
count
at
least
four
cases
in
the
court's
history
where
the
court
has
accepted
a
waiver
by
the
solicitor
general
and
reached
a
tax
issue.
i
have
at
least
three
cases,
one
of
them
just
mentioned
by
justice
kagan,
where
exceptions
to
that
rule
were
read
in.
given
that
history,
regardless
of
how
we
define
jurisdictional
statutes
versus
claim
processing
statutes
in
recent
times,
isn't
the
fairer
statement
that
congress
has
accepted
that
in
the
extraordinary
case
we
will
hear
the
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
doesn't
that
just
prove
that
it
knows
that
the
court
will
impose
a
claim
processing
rule
in
many
circumstances,
and
so,
in
those
in
which
it
specifically
doesn't
want
the
court
to,
it
has
to
be
clearer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked.
assuming
we
find
that
this
is
not
jurisdictional,
what
is
the
parade
of
horribles
that
you
see
occurring
if
we
call
this
a
mandatory
claim
processing
rule?
what
kinds
of
cases
do
you
imagine
that
courts
will
reach?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
question
was
if
we
deem
this
a
mandatory
claim
processing
rule--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
cases
do
you
imagine
courts
will
reach
on
what
grounds?
assuming
the
government
does
its
job
and
comes
in
and
raises
the
aia
as
an
immediate
defense--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
can
a
court
then
reach
the
question,
despite--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assumes
the
lack
of
competency
of
the
government,
which
i
don't,
but
what
other
types
of
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
bob
jones
involved
a
statute
where
it
denominated
the
exaction
as
a
tax.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
here
we
have
one
where
the
congress
is
not
denominating
it
as
a
tax;
it's
denominating
it
as
a
penalty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
absolutely.
but
even
the
section
of
the
code
that
you
referred
to
previously,
the
one
following
7421,
the
aia,
it
does
very
clearly
make
a
difference
--
7422
--
make
a
difference
between
tax
and
penalties.
it's
very
explicit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
why
you
think
the
solicitor
general's
reading
creates
a
problem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
it
is
a
jurisdictional
bar,
but
there's
an
exemption
for
those
items
that
congress
has
designated
solely
as
penalties
that
are
not
like
taxes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not
--
that's
carrying
it
too
far,
because
he
says
if
a
penalty
is
designated
as
a
tax
by
congress
then
it's
subject
to
the
aia,
and
that's
most
of
the
code,
the
tax
code.
and
he
says
for
those
portions
of
the
affordable
care
act
that
designate
things
as
taxes,
the
aia
applies.
so
it's
only
--
and
i
haven't
found
another
statute.
i'm
going
to
ask
him
if
there's
another
one.
it's
only
for
those
statutes
in
which
congress
has
designated
something
solely
as
a
penalty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
not
indicated
that
it
is
a
tax.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
don't
fall
within
the
aia.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
general,
you
also
have
the
bailey
child
labor
tax
cases,
because
there
the
court
said
that
the
tax,
which
was
a
prohibitory
tax
alone,
was
a
tax
subject
to
the
aia,
and
then
it
said
it
was
beyond
the
court's
taxing
power
in
a
separate
case,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
issue--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how,
if
you're
troubled--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
we
address,
general,
the
question
of
whether
there
are
any
collateral
consequences
for
the
failure
to
buy
--
to
not
buy
health
insurance?
is
the
only
consequence
the
payment
of
the
penalty?
the
private
respondents
argue
that
there
are
other
collateral
consequences
such
as
for
people
on
probation
who
are
disobeying
the
law,
if
they
don't
buy
health
insurance
they
would
be
disobeying
the
law
and
could
be
subject
to
having
their
supervised
release
revoked.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
whole
point
that
this
was
inartful
drafting
by
congress;
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
exemption
under
the
penalty,
it's
an
exemption
from
the
legal
obligation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
is
an
additional
textural
indication
of
that,
which
one
can
find
at
page
13
of
our
reply
brief.
this
is
a
provision
that
is
42
u.s.c.
a,
section
18022(e).
this
is
a
provision
that
provides
for
a
certification
that
certain
individuals
can
get.
and
it's
the
paragraph
starting
with
the
words
"other
provisions",
contains
the
quote.
and
it
says:
"an
individual
with
a
certification
that
the
individual
is
exempt
from
the
requirement
under
section
5000a,
by
reason
of
section
5000a(e)(1)
of
such
code,
is
entitled
to
a
certificate
that
allows
for
enrollment
in
a
particular
program
for
this
category
of
people.
"
but
you
can
see
here,
congress
is
saying
it's
an
exemption
from
under
5000a(e)(1),
which
is
the
exemption
from
the
penalty,
and
not
the
underlying
requirement
is,
as
congress
says,
an
exemption
from
the
requirement
of
section
5000a.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
but
i
thought
the
people
who
were
eligible
for
medicaid
weren't
subject
to
the
penalty.
am
i
wrong?
i
could
be
just
factually
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
those
people
below.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
why
is
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
tell
me
something,
why
isn't
this
case
subject
to
the
same
bars
that
--
that
you
list
in
your
brief?
the
tax
court,
at
least
so
far,
considers
constitutional
challenges
to
statutes,
so
why
aren't
we
--
why
isn't
this
case
subject
to
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
exhaust?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
--
that
--
that
--
that's
not
true.
the
suit
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
hearing
the
action.
it
has
to
do
with
a
form
of
relief
that
congress
is
barring.
it's
not
permitting
--
it
is
not
a
tax
case,
you
can
come
in
afterwards.
it's
not
permitting
the
court
to
exercise
what
otherwise
would
be
one
of
its
powers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
does
seem
strange
to
think
of
a
--
a
law
that
says
no
court
can
entertain
a
certain
action
and
give
a
certain
remedy
as
merely
a
claim
processing
rule.
what
the
--
the
court
is
being
ousted
from
--
from
what
would
otherwise
be
its
power
to
hear
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
deal
with
this
case
and
our
gonzalez
--
our
recent
gonzalez
case
where
we
talked
about--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
language
of
the
coa
statute
that
no
appeal
will
be
heard
absent
the
issuance
of?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
is
an
argument
that
we
should
just
simply
say
that
bowles
applies
only
to
appeals,
but
we
haven't
said
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
all
of
those
--
all
of
that
in
particular--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
we
haven't
relied
on
it
in
other
cases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
many
of
which
themselves
speak
in
very
clear
jurisdictional
language.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
say
--
why
don't
we
say
it's
jurisdictional
except
when
the
solicitor
general
waives?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
would
that
not
promote
congress's
policy
of
insuring
--
or
congress,
explicitly--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--yes.
it's
a
contradiction
in
terms.
i
don't
disagree.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
raised
it
and
then
gave
it
up.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
bit
confused.
and
this
is
what
i'm
confused
about.
there
--
there
is
a
challenge
to
the
individual
mandate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
what
is
--
the
fact
that
the
state
is
challenging
medicaid,
how
does
it
give
the
state
standing
to
challenge
an
obligation
that
is
not
imposed
on
the
state
in
any
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
that's
what
i'm--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
confused
by
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
i
see
or
have
seen
three
strands
of
arguments
in
your
briefs,
and
one
of
them
is
echoed
today.
the
first
strand
that
i
have
seen
is
that
congress
can
pass
any
necessary
laws
to
effect
those
powers
within
its
rights,
i.e.,
because
it
made
a
decision
that
to
effect,
to
effect
mandatory
issuance
of
insurance,
that
it
could
also
obligate
the
mandatory
purchase
of
it.
the
second
strand
i
see
is
self-insurance
affects
the
market,
and
so
the
government
can
regulate
those
who
self-insure.
and
the
third
argument
--
and
i
see
all
of
them
as
different
--
is
that
what
the
government
is
doing,
and
i
think
it's
the
argument
you're
making
today
--
that
what
the
--
what
the
government
is
saying
is
if
you
pay
for
--
if
you
use
health
services,
you
have
to
pay
with
insurance.
because
only
insurance
will
guarantee
that
whatever
need
for
health
care
that
you
have
will
be
covered.
because
virtually
no
one,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
1
percent
of
the
population,
can
afford
the
massive
cost
if
the
unexpected
happens.
this
third
argument
seems
to
be
saying
what
we
are
regulating
is
health
care,
and
when
you
go
for
health
services,
you
have
to
pay
for
insurance,
and
since
insurance
won't
issue
at
the
moment
that
you
consume
the
product,
we
can
reasonably,
necessarily
tell
you
to
buy
it
ahead
of
time,
because
you
can't
buy
it
at
the
moment
that
you
need
it.
is
that
--
which
of
these
three
is
your
argument?
are
all
of
them
your
argument?
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
on
that
ground,
you're
answering
affirmatively
to
my
colleagues
that
have
asked
you
the
question,
can
the
government
force
you
into
commerce.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there
is
no
limit
to
that
power.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
could
you
turn
to
the
tax
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
looked
for
a
case
that
involves
the
issue
of
whether
something
denominated
by
congress
as
a
penalty
was
nevertheless
treated
as
a
tax,
except
in
those
situations
where
the
code
itself
or
the
statute
itself
said
treat
the
penalty
as
a
tax.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
we've
done
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general,
the
problem
goes
back
to
the
limiting
principle.
is
this
simply
anything
that
raises
revenue
that
congress
can
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
has
to
be
a
limiting
principle
--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
you
accept
your
--
the
general's
position
that
you
have
conceded
that
congress
could
say,
if
you're
going
to
consume
health
services,
you
have
to
pay
by
way
of
insurance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what
do
you
do
with
the
impossibility
of
buying
insurance
at
the
point
of
consumption.
virtually,
you
force
insurance
companies
to
sell
it
to
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we
have
an
exemption?
could
the
government
say,
everybody
pays
a
shared
health
care
responsibility
payment
to
offset
all
the
money
that
we
are
forced
to
spend
on
health
care,
we
the
government;
but,
anybody
who
has
an
insurance
policy
is
exempt
from
that
tax?
could
the
government
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
what
theory
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
get
tax
credits
for
having
solar-powered
homes.
we
get
tax
credits
for
using
fuel
efficient
cars.
why
couldn't
we
get
a
tax
credit
for
having
health
insurance
and
saving
the
government
from
caring
for
us.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
don't
in
car
insurance,
meaning
we
tell
people,
buy
car
--
not
we,
the
states
do,
although
you're
going
to
--
i'll
ask
you
the
question,
do
you
think
that
if
some
states
decided
not
to
impose
an
insurance
requirement,
that
the
federal
government
would
be
without
power
to
legislate
and
require
every
individual
to
buy
car
insurance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
goes
back
to
the
substantive
due
process
question.
is
this
a
lochner
era
argument
that
only
the
states
can
do
this,
even
though
it
affects
commerce?
cars
indisputably
affect
commerce.
so
are
you
arguing
that
because
the
states
have
done
it
all
along,
the
federal
government
is
no
longer
permitted
to
legislate
in
this
area?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
health
insurance
--
i
mean,
i've
never
gotten
into
an
accident,
thankfully,
and
i
hope
never.
the
vast
majority
of
people
have
never
gotten
into
an
accident
where
they
have
injured
others;
yet,
we
pay
for
it
dutifully
every
year
on
the
possibility
that
at
some
point
we
might
get
into
that
accident.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
--
but
the
given
is
that
virtually
everyone,
absent
some
intervention
from
above,
meaning
that
someone's
life
will
be
cut
short
in
a
fatal
way,
virtually
everyone
will
use
health
care.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
but
that's
exactly
what
justice
marshall
said
in
gibbons.
he
said
that
it
is
the
power
to
regulate,
the
power
like
all
others
vested
in
congress
is
complete
in
itself,
may
be
exercised
to
its
utmost
extent,
and
acknowledges
no
limitations
other
than
those
prescribed
in
the
constitution.
but
there
is
no
conscription
in
the,
set
forth
in
the
constitution
with
respect
to
regulating
commerce.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
tell
me,
do
you
think
the
states
could
pass
this
mandate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
other
area
of
commerce,
business,
where
we
have
held
that
there
is
a
concurrent
power
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
to
protect
the
welfare
of
commerce?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
but
that's
true
of
almost
every
product.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
true
of
almost
every
product,
directly
or
indirectly
by
government
regulation.
the
government
says,
borrowing
my
colleague's
example,
you
can't
buy
a
car
without
emission
control.
i
don't
want
a
car
with
emission
control.
it's
less
efficient
in
terms
of
the
horsepower.
but
i'm
forced
to
do
something
i
don't
want
to
do
by
government
regulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
force
me
to
buy--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
forced
me
to
buy
if
i
need
unpasteurized
foods,
goods
that
don't
have
certain
pesticides
but
have
others.
there
is
government
compulsion
in
almost
every
economic
decision
because
the
government
regulates
so
much.
it's
a
condition
of
life
that
some
may
rail
against,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
let
the
government
regulate
the
manufacturing
process
whether
or
not
the
goods
will
enter
into
interstate
commerce,
merely
because
they
might
statistically.
we
--
there
is
all
sorts
of
government
regulation
of
manufacturing
plants,
of
agricultural
farms,
of
all
sorts
of
activity
that
will
be
purely
intrastate
because
it
might
affect
interstate
activity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
is
that
different
from
saying
you
are
self-insuring
today,
you're
foregoing
insurance?
why
isn't
that
a
predecessor
to
the
need
that
you're
eventually
going
to
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that
there's
--
what
percentage
of
the
american
people
who
took
their
son
or
daughter
to
an
emergency
room
and
that
child
was
turned
away
because
the
parent
didn't
have
insurance
--
do
you
think
there's
a
large
percentage
of
the
american
population
who
would
stand
for
the
death
of
that
child--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
had
an
allergic
reaction
and
a
simple
shot
would
have
saved
the
child?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
did
you
say
the
penalty's
okay
but
not
the
mandate?
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i've
misheard
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
the
--
i
--
i
want
to
understand
the
choices
you're
saying
congress
has.
congress
can
tax
everybody
and
set
up
a
public
health
care
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
would
be
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
congress
can
--
you're
taking
the
same
position
as
your
colleague,
congress
can't
say
we're
going
to
set
up
a
public
health
system,
but
you
can
get
a
tax
credit
if
you
have
private
health
insurance
because
you
won't
access
the
public
system.
are
you
taking
the
same
position
as
your
colleague?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
is
this
different
than
this
act
which
says
if
a
taxpayer
fails
to
meet
the
requirement
of
having
minimum
coverage,
then
they
are
responsible
for
paying
the
shared
responsibility
payment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
--
i
think
that's
what's
happening,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we're
paying
--
i
thought
that
everybody
was
paying,
what
is
it,
$10
a
pack
now?
i
don't
even
know
the
price.
it's
pretty
high.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
everybody
recognizes
that
it's
all
taxation
for
the
purposes
of
dissuading
you
to
buy
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
that
may
well
be
true.
the
economists
are
going
back
and
forth
on
that
issue,
and
the
figures
vary
from
up
10
percent
to
up
30.
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
legislative
findings.
what
we
do
know
is
that
for
those
states
that
found
prices
increasing,
that
they
found
various
solutions
to
that.
in
one
instance,
and
we
might
or
may
not
say
that
it's
unconstitutional,
massachusetts
passed
the
mandatory
coverage
provision.
but
others
adjusted
some
of
the
other
provisions.
why
shouldn't
we
let
congress
do
that,
if
in
fact,
the
economists
prove,
some
of
the
economists
prove
right,
that
prices
will
spiral?
what's
wrong
with
leaving
it
to
--
in
the
hands
of
the
people
who
should
be
fixing
this,
not
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
all
it
said
it's
essential
to.
i
mean,
i'm
looking
at
it.
the
exchanges,
the
state
exchanges
are
information
--
gathering
facilities
that
tell
insurers
what
the
various
policies
actually
mean.
and
that
has
proven
to
be
a
cost
saver
in
many
of
the
states
who
have
tried
it.
so
why
should
we
be
striking
down
a
cost
saver
when
if
what
your
argument
is,
was,
that
congress
was
concerned
about
costs
rising?
why
should
we
assume
they
wouldn't
have
passed
that
information?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
want
a
bottom
line
is
why
don't
we
let
congress
fix
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
not
taking
--
if
we
strike
down
one
provision,
we
are
not
taking
that
power
away
from
congress.
congress
could
look
at
it
without
the
mandatory
coverage
provision
and
say,
this
model
doesn't
work;
let's
start
from
the
beginning.
or
it
could
choose
to
fix
what
it
has.
we
are
not
declaring
--
one
portion
doesn't
force
congress
into
any
path.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
take
on
more
power
to
the
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
congress
would
choose
to
take
one
path
rather
than
another.
that's
sort
of
taking
onto
the
court
more
power
than
one
i
think
would
want.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
it's
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no
statute
can
do
that,
because
once
we
chop
off
a
piece
of
it,
by
definition,
it's
not
the
statute
congress
passed.
so
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
wrong
with
the
presumption
that
our
law
says,
which
is
we
presume
that
congress
would
want
to
sever?
wouldn't
that
be
the
simplest,
most
objective
test?
going
past
what
justice
scalia
says
we
have
done,
okay,
get
rid
of
legislative
intent
altogether,
which
some
of
our
colleagues
in
other
contexts
have
promoted,
and
just
say:
unless
congress
tells
us
directly,
it's
not
severable,
we
shouldn't
sever.
we
should
let
them
fix
their
problems.
you
still
haven't
asked
--
answered
me
why
in
a
democracy
structured
like
ours,
where
each
branch
does
different
things,
why
we
should
involve
the
court
in
making
the
legislative
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
a
new
rule.
we
presume.
we've
rebutted
the
presumption
in
some
cases--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
some
would
call
that
judicial
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
kneedler
would
you
please--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
kneedler,
move
away
from
the
issue
of
whether
it's
a
standing
question
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
make
the
assumption
that's
an
--
that
this
is
an
issue
of
the
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
because
the
last
two
questions
had
to
do
with
what's
wise
for
the
court
to
do,
not
whether
it
has
power
to
do
it
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
let's
move
beyond
the
power
issue,
which
your
answers
have
centered
on,
and
give
me
a
sort
of
--
policy.
and
i
know
that's
a,
that's
a
bugaboo
word
sometimes,
but
what
should
guide
the
court's
discretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
please
--
i've
asked
you
three
times
to
move
around
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
the
answer
was
you
don't
have
to
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
we
have
to
look
at
is
what
congress
said
was
essential,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
get
back
to
the
argument
of
--
of
the
heart?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
striking
down
the
heart,
do
we
want
half
a
loaf
or
show.
i
think
those
are
the
two
analogies--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
thought
that
the
26-year-olds
were
saying
that
they
were
healthy
and
didn't
need
insurance
yesterday.
so
today
they
are
going
to
bankrupt
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
problem
i
have
is
that
you
are
ignoring
the
congressional
findings
and
all
of
the
evidence
congress
had
before
it
that
community
ratings
and
guaranteed-issuance
would
be
a
death
spiral
--
i
think
that
was
the
word
that
was
used
--
without
minimum
coverage.
those
are
all
of
the
materials
that
are
part
of
the
legislative
record
here.
so
even
if
it
might
not
be
because
of
the
structure
of
the
act,
that's
post
hoc
evidence.
why
should
we
be
looking
at
that
as
opposed
to
what
congress
had
before
it
and
use
essential
in
its
plain
meaning.
you
can't
have
minimum
coverage
without,
what
the
sg
is
arguing,
community
ratings
and
guaranteed-issue.
you
can't
have
those
two
without
minimum
coverage.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
don't
want
them
to
say,
either,
that
there
is
a
death
spiral.
do
you
want
--
you
don't
want
us
to
make
either
of
those
two
findings,
i'm
assuming?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--amicis'
point,
he
says
that
congress
didn't
go
into
this
act
to
impose
minimum
coverage.
they
went
into
the
act
to
have
a
different
purpose,
i.e.,
to
get
people
coverage
jury
when
they
needed
it,
to
increase
coverage
for
people,
but
this
is
only
a
tool.
but
other
states
--
going
back
to
my
original
point,
that
are
other
tools
besides
minimum
coverage
that
congress
can
achieve
these
goals.
so
if
we
strike
just
a
tool,
why
should
we
strike
the
whole
act,
when
congress
has
other
tools
available?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
is
that
a
limit
on
the
federal
government's
power
to
tax?.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
that
at
a
certain
point
the
states
would
have
a
claim
against
the
federal
government
raising
their
taxes
because
somehow
the
states
will
feel
coerced
to
lower
their
tax
rate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
counsel,
what
percentage
does
it
become
coercive?
meaning,
as
i
look
at
the
figures
i've
seen
from
amici,
there
are
some
states
for
whom
the
percentage
of
medicaid
funding
to
their
budget
is
close
to
40
percent,
but
there
are
others
that
are
less
than
10
percent.
and
you
say,
across
the
board
this
is
coercive
because
no
state,
even
at
10
percent,
can
give
it
up.
what's
the
percentage
of
big
gift
that
the
federal
government
can
give?
because
what
you're
saying
to
me
is,
for
a
bankrupt
state,
there's
no
gift
the
federal
government
could
give
them
ever,
because
it
can
only
give
them
money
without
conditions.
no
matter
how
poorly
the
state
is
run,
no
matter
how
much
the
federal
government
doesn't
want
to
subsidize
abortions
or
doesn't
want
to
subsidize
some
other
state
obligation,
the
federal
government
can't
give
them
100
percent
of
their
needs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
makes
them
coercive;
that
the
state
doesn't
want
to
face
its
voters
and
say,
instead
of
taking
10,
20,
30,
40
percent
of
the
government's
offer
of
our
budget
and
paying
for
it
ourselves
and
giving
up
money
for
some
other
function?
that's
what
makes
it
coercive--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
the
state
is
unwilling
to
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
do
you
think
that
the
federal
government
couldn't,
if
it
chose,
congress,
say,
this
system
doesn't
work.
we
are
just
simply
going
to
rehaul
it.
it
is
not
consistent
with
how
--
what
we
want
to
accomplish.
we're
just
going
to
do
away
with
the
system
and
start
a
new
health
care
plan
of
some
sort.
and
states,
you
can
take
the
new
plan,
you
can
leave
them.
we
are
going
to
give
out
20
percent
less,
maybe
20
percent
more,
depending
on
what
congress
chooses.
can
congress
do
that?
does
it
have
to
continue
the
old
system
because
that
is
what
the
states
are
relying
upon
and
it's
coercive
now
to
give
them
a
new
system?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i
--
i
want
to
know
how
i
draw
the
line,
meaning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
think
the
usual
definition
of
coercion
is,
i
don't
have
a
choice.
i'm
not
sure
what
--
why
it's
not
a
choice
for
the
states.
they
may
not
pay
for
something
else.
if
they
don't
take
medicaid
and
they
want
to
keep
the
same
level
of
coverage,
they
may
have
to
make
cuts
in
their
budget
to
other
services
they
provide.
that's
a
political
choice
of
whether
they
choose
to
do
that
or
not.
but
when
have
we
defined
the
right
or
limited
the
right
of
government
not
to
spend
money
in
the
ways
that
it
thinks
appropriate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
my
greatest
fear,
mr.
clement,
with
your
argument
is
the
following:
the
bigger
the
problem,
the
more
resources
it
needs.
we're
going
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
in
choosing
how
to
structure
a
cooperative
relationship
with
the
states.
we're
going
to
say
to
the
federal
government,
the
bigger
the
problem,
the
less
your
powers
are.
because
once
you
give
that
much
money,
you
can't
structure
the
program
the
way
you
want.
it's
our
money,
federal
government.
we're
going
to
have
to
run
the
program
ourself
to
protect
all
our
interests.
i
don't
see
where
to
draw
that
line.
the
uninsured
are
a
problem
for
states
only
because
they,
too,
politically,
just
like
the
federal
government,
can't
let
the
poor
die.
and
so
to
the
extent
they
don't
want
to
do
that,
it's
because
they
feel
accountable
to
their
citizenry.
and
so
if
they
want
to
do
it
their
way,
they
have
to
spend
the
money
to
do
it
their
way,
if
they
don't
want
to
do
it
the
federal
way.
so
i
--
i
just
don't
understand
the
logic
of
saying
states,
you
can't
--
you
don't
--
you're
not
entitled
to
our
money,
but
once
you
start
taking
it,
the
more
you
take,
the
more
power
you
have.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr
clement.
he's
not
going
home
tonight--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
could
you
tell
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
don't
understand
your
first
answer
to
justice
kagan.
you
don't
see
there
being
a
difference
between
the
federal
government
saying
we
want
to
take
care
of
the
poor.
states,
if
you
do
this,
we'll
pay
100
percent
of
your
administrative
costs.
and
you
said
that
could
be
coercion.
all
right.
doesn't
the
amount
of
burden
that
the
state
undertakes
to
meet
the
federal
obligation
count
in
this
equation
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
we
go
pack
to
the
era
of
matching
what
a
state
pays
to
what
a
state
gets,
florida
loses.
it's
citizens
pay
out
much
less
than
what
they
get
back
in
federal
subsidies
of
all
kinds.
so
you
can't
really
be
making
the
argument
that
florida
can't
ask
for
more
than
it
gives,
because
it's
really
giving
less
than
it
receives.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
really
want
to
go
to
that
point,
do
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
back--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general,
i'm
trying.
--to
go
back
to
that.
because
justice
kennedy
asked
you
whether
there
is
--
i
think
he
said
it's
--
it's
coercion
if
no
one
can
be
politically
accountable.
i'm
not
sure
how
that
could
be
practically
politically
accountable,
because
almost
every
gift
--
if
the
terms
are
attractive,
it
would
be
an
unattractive
political
alternative
to
turn
it
down.
dole
itself
was
one
of
those
cases.
i
think
every
state
raised
the
drinking
age
to
21;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
my
point
is
that
political
accountability
has
two
components:
what
can
i
do
if
i
like
something,
and
what
can
i
do
if
i
don't
like
something.
and
if
people
really
like
something
like
medicaid,
they
were
not
going
to
let
you
drop
it,
correct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
that's
the
whole
point
that's
their
choice,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
made
a
choice
with
the
stimulus
bill,
didn't
they?
some
governors
rejected
the
stimulus
bill--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
some
of
--
some
of
their
congressional
or
legislative
processes
overturned
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
others
supported
it.
the
percentages
were
smaller,
but
it's
always
the
preference
of
the
voters
as
to
what
they
want,
isn't
it?
