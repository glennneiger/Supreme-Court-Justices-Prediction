justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
don't
want
you
to
lose
the
second
half
of
your
argument.
and
we
have
spent
all
the
time
so
far
on
jurisdiction.
and
i
accept,
pretty
much,
i'm
probably
leaning
in
your
favor
on
jurisdiction,
but
where
i
see
the
problem
is
in
the
second
part,
because
the
second
part
says
"restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax.
"
now,
here,
congress
has
nowhere
used
the
word
"tax".
what
it
says
is
penalty.
moreover,
this
is
not
in
the
internal
revenue
code
"but
for
purposes
of
collection".
and
so
why
is
this
a
tax?
and
i
know
you
point
to
certain
sentences
that
talk
about
taxes
within
the
code--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
this
is
not
attached
to
a
tax.
it
is
attached
to
a
health
care
requirement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
why
does
it
fall
within
that
word?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
aia
applies.
i
mean
--
and
then
they
provide
some
exceptions,
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
aia
applies.
it
says
"in
the
same
manner
as".
it
is
then
attached
to
chapter
68,
when
that
--
it
that
references
that
as
"being
the
manner
of".
well,
that
it's
being
applied
--
or
if
it's
being
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax
doesn't
automatically
make
it
a
tax,
particularly
since
the
reasons
for
the
aia
are
to
prevent
interference
with
revenue
sources.
and
here,
an
advance
attack
on
this
does
not
interfere
with
the
collection
of
revenues.
i
mean,
that's
--
you
have
read
the
arguments,
as
have
i.
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
say
succinctly
in
response
to
those
arguments.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
best
collection
i've
found
in
your
favor,
i
think,
is
in
mortimer
caplin's
brief
on
page
16,
17.
he
has
a
whole
list.
all
right.
so
--
i
got
my
law
clerk
to
look
all
those
up.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
all
fall
into
the
categories
of
either,
one,
these
are
penalties
that
were
penalties
assessed
for
not
paying
taxes,
or,
two,
they
involve
matters
that
were
called
by
the
court
taxes,
or,
three,
in
some
instances
they
were
deemed
by
the
code
to
be
taxes.
now
what
we
have
here
is
something
that's
in
a
different
statute
that
doesn't
use
the
word
aia
reason,
which
is
to
say
to
the
solicitor
general,
we
don't
care
what
you
think,
we,
in
congress,
don't
want
you
in
court
where
the
revenue
of
a
state
--
tax
injunction
act
--
or
the
revenue
of
the
federal
government
is
at
stake,
and,
therefore,
you
can't
waive
it.
now
i
got
that.
here
it's
not
at
stake
and
here
are
all
the
differences
i
just
mentioned.
so
i
ask
that
because
i
want
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
davis
was
the
case
where
a
shareholder
sues
the
corporation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
remedy
is
that
the
corporation
shouldn't
pay
the
money
to
the
tax
authority.
now,
it's
a
little
technical,
but
that
isn't
actually
an
injunction
against
the
tax
authority
collecting.
he's
not
--
they're
not
restraining
the
collection
of
tax.
they're
saying
to
the
taxpayer,
don't
pay
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
how
far
that
gets
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
keep
saying
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
penalty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
your
point
that
the
tax
--
so,
what
we
want
to
do
is
get
money
from
these
people.
most
of
them
get
the
money
by
buying
the
insurance
and
that
will
help
pay.
but
if
they
don't,
they
are
going
to
pay
this
penalty,
and
that
will
help,
too.
and
the
fact
that
we
put
the
latter
in
brings
it
within
the
taxing
power.
and
as
far
as
this
act
is
concerned
about
the
injunction,
they
called
it
a
penalty
and
not
a
tax
for
a
reason.
they
wanted
it
to
fall
outside
that,
it's
in
a
different
chapter,
et
cetera.
is
that
what
the
heart
of
what
you
are
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
basically
it
begs
the
difference
--
language
is
relevant,
there
are
a
lot
of
relevant
things.
but
one
thing
that's
relevant
in
my
mind
is
that
taxes
are,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
life's
blood
of
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
is
to
say
there
is
a
procedure
here
that
you
go
through.
you
can
get
your
money
back,
or
you
go
through
the
tax
court,
but
don't
do
this
in
advance
for
the
reason
that
we
don't
want
500
federal
judge
--
judges
substituting
their
idea
of
what
is
a
proper
equitable
defense
of
when
there
should
be
an
exception
made
about
da,
da,
da
for
the
basic
rule.
no.
okay?
and
so
there
is
strong
reason
that
is
there.
you
tried
to
apply
that
reason
to
the
copyright
law.
you
can't
find
it.
registration
with
the
copyright
register
is
not
the
life's
blood
of
anything.
copyright
exists
regardless.
so
the
reasoning
isn't
there.
the
language
--
i
see
the
similarity
of
language.
i've
got
that.
but
it's
the
reasoning,
the
sort
of
underlying
reason
for
not
wanting
a
waiver
here
that
--
that
is
--
has
a
significant
role
in
my
mind
of
finding
that
it
is
jurisdictional.
plus
the
fact
that
we
have
said
it
nonstop
since
that
northrop
or
whatever
that
other
case
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fine.
i
just
wanted
to
ask
the
question
in
case
you
wanted
to
answer
the
policy
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
that's
going
to
really
what
i
think
congress's
intent
was
meant
to
be
in
sticking
the
collection
thing
into
chapter
68,
and
--
and
it's
certainly
an
argument
in
your
favor.
the
--
the
over-arching
thing
in
my
mind
is
it's
--
it's
up
to
congress
within
leeway.
and
they
did
not
use
that
word
"tax",
and
they
did
have
a
couple
of
exceptions.
and
it
is
true
that
all
this
language
that
you
quote
--
you
know,
the
first
two
sentences
and
so
forth,
it
talks
about
the
use
of
tax
in
the
irc.
it
talks
about
the
penalties
and
liabilities
provided
by
this
subchapter.
and
we
look
over
here
and
it's
a
penalty
and
liability
provided
by
a
different
law,
which
says
collect
it
through
the
subchapter,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
irc.
see?
so
we've
got
it
in
a
separate
place,
we
can
see
pretty
clearly
what
they're
trying
to
do.
they
couldn't
really
care
very
much
about
interfering
with
collecting
this
one.
that's
all
the
statutory
argument.
are
you
following
me?
you
see?
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
focus
on
that
kind
of
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
that
is
your
difference
--
if
that
is
your
difference,
i'm
somewhat
uncertain
about
your
answers
to
--
for
example,
justice
kennedy
asked,
can
you,
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
create
commerce
where
previously
none
existed.
well,
yeah,
i
thought
the
answer
to
that
was,
since
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
when
the
court
said
congress
could
create
the
bank
of
the
united
states
which
did
not
previously
exist,
which
job
was
to
create
commerce
that
did
not
previously
exist,
since
that
time
the
answer
has
been,
yes.
i
would
have
thought
that
your
answer
--
can
the
government,
in
fact,
require
you
to
buy
cell
phones
or
buy
burials
that,
if
we
propose
comparable
situations,
if
we
have,
for
example,
a
uniform
united
states
system
of
paying
for
every
burial
such
as
medicare
burial,
medicaid
burial,
chip
burial,
erisa
burial
and
emergency
burial
beside
the
side
of
the
road,
and
congress
wanted
to
rationalize
that
system,
wouldn't
the
answer
be,
yes,
of
course,
they
could.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
same
with
the
computers
or
the
same
with
the
--
the
cell
phones,
if
you're
driving
by
the
side
of
the
highway
and
there
is
a
federal
emergency
service
just
as
you
say
you
have
to
buy
certain
mufflers
for
your
car
that
don't
hurt
the
environment,
you
could
--
i
mean,
see,
doesn't
it
depend
on
the
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
would
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
ask
--
can
i
go
back
for
a
step,
because
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
discussion
of
whether
this
is
a
good
bill
or
not.
some
people
think
it's
going
to
save
a
lot
of
money.
some
people
think
it
won't.
so
i'm
focusing
just
on
the
commerce
clause;
not
on
the
due
process
clause,
the
commerce
clause.
and
i
look
back
into
history,
and
i
think
if
we
look
back
into
history
we
see
sometimes
congress
can
create
commerce
out
of
nothing.
that's
the
national
bank,
which
was
created
out
of
nothing
to
create
other
commerce
out
of
nothing.
i
look
back
into
history,
and
i
see
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
if
there
are
substantial
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
congress
can
act.
and
i
look
at
the
person
who's
growing
marijuana
in
her
house,
or
i
look
at
the
farmer
who
is
growing
the
wheat
for
home
consumption.
this
seems
to
have
more
substantial
effects.
is
this
commerce?
well,
it
seems
to
me
more
commerce
than
marijuana.
i
mean,
is
it,
in
fact,
a
regulation?
well,
why
not?
if
creating
a
bank
is,
why
isn't
this?
and
then
you
say,
ah,
but
one
thing
here
out
of
all
those
things
is
different,
and
that
is
you're
making
somebody
do
something.
i
say,
hey,
can't
congress
make
people
drive
faster
than
45
--
40
miles
an
hour
on
a
road?
didn't
they
make
that
man
growing
his
own
wheat
go
into
the
market
and
buy
other
wheat
for
his
--
for
his
cows?
didn't
they
make
mrs.
--
if
she
married
somebody
who
had
marijuana
in
her
basement,
wouldn't
she
have
to
go
and
get
rid
of
it?
affirmative
action?
i
mean,
where
does
this
distinction
come
from?
it
sounds
like
sometimes
you
can,
and
sometimes
you
can't.
so
what
is
argued
here
is
there
is
a
large
group
of
--
what
about
a
person
that
we
discover
that
there
are
--
a
disease
is
sweeping
the
united
states,
and
40
million
people
are
susceptible,
of
whom
10
million
will
die;
can't
the
federal
government
say
all
40
million
get
inoculation?
so
here,
we
have
a
group
of
40
million,
and
57
percent
of
those
people
visit
emergency
care
or
other
care,
which
we
are
paying
for.
and
22
percent
of
those
pay
more
than
$100,000
for
that.
and
congress
says
they
are
in
the
midst
of
this
big
thing.
we
just
want
to
rationalize
this
system
they
are
already
in.
so,
there,
you
got
the
whole
argument,
and
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
no,
it's
one
question.
it's
looking
back
at
that
--
looking
back
at
that
history.
the
thing
i
can
see
that
you
say
to
some
people,
go
buy;
why
does
that
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
commerce
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you
think
you
can,
better
than
the
actuaries
or
better
than
the
members
of
congress
who
worked
on
it,
look
at
the
40
million
people
who
are
not
insured
and
say
which
ones
next
year
will
or
will
not
use,
say,
emergency
care?
can
you
do
that
any
better
than
if
we
knew
that
40
million
people
were
suffering,
about
to
suffer
a
contagious
disease,
and
only
10
million
would
get
sick--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
we
don't
know
which?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
we
do
know
that
there
are
a
few
people,
more
in
new
york
city
than
there
are
in
wyoming,
who
never
will
buy
a
car.
but
we
also
know
here,
and
we
don't
like
to
admit
it,
that
because
we
are
human
beings
we
all
suffer
from
the
risk
of
getting
sick.
and
we
also
all
know
that
we'll
get
seriously
sick.
and
we
also
know
that
we
can't
predict
when.
and
we
also
know
that
when
we
do,
there
will
be
our
fellow
taxpayers
through
the
federal
government
who
will
pay
for
this.
if
we
do
not
buy
insurance,
we
will
pay
nothing.
and
that
happens
with
a
large
number
of
people
in
this
group
of
40
million,
none
of
whom
can
be
picked
out
in
advance.
now,
that's
quite
different
from
a
car
situation,
and
it's
different
in
only
this
respect.
it
shows
there
is
a
national
problem,
and
it
shows
there
is
a
national
problem
that
involves
money,
cost
insurance.
so
if
congress
could
do
this,
should
there
be
a
disease
that
strikes
the
united
states
and
they
want
every
one
inoculated
even
though
ten
million
will
be
hurt,
it's
hard
for
me
to
decide
why
that
isn't
interstate
commerce,
even
more
so
where
we
know
it
affects
everybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
sounds
like
you're
debating
the
merits
of
the
bill.
you
ask
really
for
limiting
principles
so
we
don't
get
into
a
matter
that
i
think
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case:
broccoli,
okay?
and
the
limiting
principles,
you've
heard
three.
first,
the
solicitor
general
came
up
with
a
couple
joined,
very
narrow
ones.
you've
seen
in
lopez
this
court
say
that
we
cannot,
congress
cannot
get
into
purely
local
affairs,
particularly
where
they
are
noncommercial.
and,
of
course,
the
greatest
limiting
principle
of
all,
which
not
too
many
accept,
so
i'm
not
going
to
emphasize
that,
is
the
limiting
principle
derived
from
the
fact
that
members
of
congress
are
elected
from
states
and
that
95
percent
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
state
law.
that
is
a
principle
though
enforced
by
the
legislature.
the
other
two
are
principles,
one
written
into
lopez
and
one
you
just
heard.
it
seems
to
me
all
of
those
eliminate
the
broccoli
possibility,
and
none
of
them
eliminates
the
possibility
that
we
are
trying
to
take
the
40
million
people
who
do
have
the
medical
cost,
who
do
affect
interstate
commerce
and
provide
a
system
that
you
may
like
or
not
like.
that's
where
we
are
in
limiting
principles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
right
there
--
in
your
view
right
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
just
picking
on
something.
i'd
like
to
just
--
if
it
turned
out
there
was
some
terrible
epidemic
sweeping
the
united
states,
and
we
couldn't
say
that
more
than
40
or
50
percent
--
i
can
make
the
number
as
high
as
i
want
--
but
the
--
the
--
you'd
say
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
the
power
to
get
people
inoculated,
to
require
them
to
be
inoculated,
because
that's
just
statistical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
answer
to
that
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
could
not
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
cannot
require
people
even
if
this
disease
is
sweeping
the
country
to
be
inoculated.
the
federal
government
has
no
power,
and
if
there's
--
okay,
fine.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
please
turn
to
justice
kagan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
it
had
huge
negative
effects
but
the
majority
thought
that
was
a
local
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
if
that's
so,
is
--
let
me
just
change
my
example
under
pressure
----
[laughter]
--and
say
that
in
fact
it
turns
out
that
90
percent
of
all
automobiles
driving
interstate
without
certain
equipment
put
up
pollution,
which
travels
interstate
--
not
100
percent,
maybe
only
60
percent.
does
the
epa
have
the
power
then
to
say
you've
got
to
have
an
antipollution
device?
it's
statistical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you're
not
going
on
statistics;
you're
going
on
something
else
which
is
what
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
we
--
now
you've
changed
the
ground
of
argument,
which
i
accept
as
--
as
totally
legitimate.
and
then
the
question
is
when
you
are
born,
and
you
don't
have
insurance,
and
you
will
in
fact
get
sick,
and
you
will
in
fact
impose
costs,
have
you
perhaps
involuntarily
--
perhaps
simply
because
you
are
a
human
being
--
entered
this
particular
market,
which
is
a
market
for
health
care?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
the
point.
you
can
go
back
to,
go
back
to
justice
kagan.
don't
forget
her
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
the
simplest
counter-example
for
me
to
suggest
is
you've
undoubtedly
read
judge
sutton's
concurring
opinion.
he
has
about
two
pages,
it
seemed
to
me,
of
examples
where
everyone
accepts
the
facts
that
under
these
kinds
of
regulations
the
government
can
compel
people
to
buy
things
they
don't
otherwise
want
to
buy.
for
example,
he
gives,
even
in
that
farm
case,
the
farmer
who
was
being
forced
to
go
out
and
buy
grain
to
feed
to
his
animals
because
he
couldn't
raise
it
at
home.
you
know
and
he
goes
through
one
example
after
another.
so
what
--
what
is
your
response
to
that,
which
you've
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
different.
i
agree
with
that.
but
you
pointed
out,
and
i
agree
with
you
on
this,
that
the
government
set
up
these
emergency
room
laws.
the
government
set
up
medicaid.
the
government
set
up
medicare.
the
government
set
up
chip,
and
there
are
40
million
people
who
don't
have
the
private
insurance.
in
that
world,
the
government
has
set
up
commerce.
it's
all
over
the
united
states.
and
in
that
world,
of
course,
the
decision
by
the
40
million
not
to
buy
the
insurance
affects
that
commerce,
and
substantially
so.
so
i
thought
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
it's
a
violation
of
some
basic
right
or
something
to
make
people
buy
things
they
don't
want,
but
simply
whether
those
decisions
of
that
group
of
40
million
people
substantially
affect
the
interstate
commerce
that
has
been
set
up
in
part
through
these
other
programs.
so
that's
the
part
of
your
argument
i'm
not
hearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
you
one
question,
which
is
a
practical
question.
i
take
as
a
given
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy,
you
are
saying
let's
look
at
it
objectively
and
say
what
congress
has
intended,
okay?
this
is
the
mandate
in
the
community,
this
is
titles
i
and
ii,
the
mandate,
the
community,
pre-existing
condition,
okay?
here's
the
rest
of
it,
you
know,
and
when
i
look
through
the
rest
of
it,
i
have
all
kinds
of
stuff
in
there.
and
i
haven't
read
every
word
of
that,
i
promise.
as
you
pointed
out,
there
is
biosimilarity,
there
is
breast
feeding,
there
is
promoting
nurses
and
doctors
to
serve
underserved
areas,
there
is
the
class
act,
etcetera.
what
do
you
suggest
we
do?
i
mean,
should
we
appoint
a
special
master
with
an
instruction?
should
we
go
back
to
the
district
court?
you
haven't
argued
most
of
these.
as
i
hear
you
now,
you're
pretty
close
to
the
sg.
i
mean,
you'd
like
it
all
struck
down,
but
we
are
supposed
to
apply
the
objective
test.
i
don't
know
if
you
differ
very
much.
so
what
do
you
propose
that
we
do
other
than
spend
a
year
reading
all
this
and
have
you
argument
all
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
the
breast
feeding
act,
the
getting
doctors
to
serve
underserved
areas,
the
biosimilar
thing
and
drug
regulation,
the
class
act,
those
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
stuff
that
we've
been
talking
about
yesterday
and
the
day
before,
okay?
so
if
you
ask
me
at
that
level,
i
would
say,
sure,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it,
they
could
stand
on
their
own.
the
indian
thing
about
helping
the
underserved
native
americans,
all
that
stuff
has
nothing
to
do.
black
lung
disease,
nothing
to
do
with
it,
okay?
so
that's
--
do
you
know
what
you
have
there?
a
total
off-the-cuff
impression.
so
that's
why
i
am
asking
you,
what
should
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he's
thinking
of
is
this:
i
think
justice
scalia
is
thinking,
i
suspect,
of
--
imagine
a
tax
which
says,
this
tax,
amount
y,
goes
to
purpose
x,
which
will
pay
for
half
of
purpose
x.
the
other
half
will
come
from
the
exchanges
somehow.
that
second
half
is
unconstitutional.
purpose
x
can't
possibly
be
carried
out
now
with
only
half
the
money.
does
the
government
just
sit
there
collecting
half
the
money
forever
because
nobody
can
ever
challenge
it?
you
see,
there
--
if
it
were
inextricably
connected,
is
it
enough
to
say,
well,
we
won't
consider
that
because
maybe
somebody
else
could
bring
that
case
and
then
there
is
no
one
else?
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
think
it's
not
uncommon
that
congress
passes
an
act,
and
then
there
are
many
titles,
and
some
of
the
titles
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
titles.
that's
a
common
thing.
and
you're
saying
you've
never
found
an
instance
where
they
are
all
struck
out
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other.
my
question
is,
because
i
hear
mr.
clement
saying
something
not
too
different
from
what
you
say.
he
talks
about
things
at
the
periphery.
we
can't
reject
or
accept
an
argument
on
severability
because
it's
a
lot
of
work
for
us.
that's
beside
the
point.
but
do
you
think
that
it's
possible
for
you
and
mr.
clement,
on
exploring
this,
to
--
to
get
together
and
agree
on
----
[laughter]
--i
mean
on
--
on
a
list
of
things
that
are
in
both
your
opinions
peripheral,
then
you
would
focus
on
those
areas
where
one
of
you
thinks
it's
peripheral
and
one
of
you
thinks
it's
not
peripheral.
and
at
that
point
it
might
turn
out
to
be
far
fewer
than
we
are
currently
imagining.
at
which
point
we
could
hold
an
argument
or
figure
out
some
way
or
somebody
hold
an
argument
and
try
to
--
try
to
get
those
done.
is
--
is
that
a
pipe
dream
or
is
that
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
would
you
--
i
would
just
like
to
hear
before
you
leave
your
argument,
if
you
want
to,
against
what
justice
scalia
just
said,
let's
assume,
contrary
to
what
you
want,
that
the
government's
position
is
accepted
by
the
majority
of
this
court.
and
so
we
now
are
rid,
quote,
of
the
true
"heart"
of
the
bill.
now
still
there
are
a
lot
of
other
provisions
here
like
the
indian
act,
the
black
lung
disease,
the
wellness
program,
that
restaurants
have
to
have
a
calorie
count
of
major
menus,
et
cetera.
now,
some
of
them
cost
money.
and
some
of
them
don't.
and
there
are
loads
of
them.
now,
what
is
your
argument
that
just
because
the
heart
of
the
bill
is
gone,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
of
these
other
provisions,
both
those
that
cost
money,
or
at
least
those
that
cost
no
money.
do
you
want
to
make
an
argument
in
that
respect,
that
destroying
the
heart
of
the
bill
does
not
blow
up
the
entire
bill;
it
blows
up
the
heart
of
the
bill.
i
just
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
stay
out
of
politics.
that's
for
congress;
not
us.
but
the,
the
question
here
is,
you've
read
all
these
cases,
or
dozens,
have
you
ever
found
a
severability
case
where
the
court
ever
said:
well,
the
heart
of
the
thing
is
gone;
and,
therefore,
we
strike
down
these
other
provisions
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
which
could
stand
on
their
feet
independently
and
can
be
funded
separately
or
don't
require
money
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that?
i'm
sorry,
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
just
said.
you
said,
congress
said,
if
you
don't
take
the
new
money
to
cover
the
new
individuals,
you
don't
get
any
of
the
old
money
that
covers
the
old
individuals.
that's
what
i
heard
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
blue
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
23a.
okay.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
the
part
about
the
funding
cutoff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
cite
section
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
have
it
in
front
of
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have,
what
i
have
in
front
of
me,
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
been
in
the
statute
since
1965.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
cite
i
have
is
42
u.s.c.
section
1396(c).
so
are
we
talking
about
the
same
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
here's
what
it
says
at
the
end.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says,
"the
secretary
shall
notify
the
state
agency.
"
--this
is
if
they
don't
comply
--
"that
further
payments
will
not
be
made
to
the
state
or,
in
his
discretion,
that
payments
will
be
limited
to
categories
under
or
parts
of
the
state
plan
not
affected
by
such
failure,
which
it
repeats
until
the
secretary
is
satisfied
that
he
shall
limit
payments
to
categories
under
or
parts
of
the
state
plan
not
affected
by
such
failure.
"
so,
reading
that
in
your
favor,
i
read
that
to
say,
it's
up
to
the
secretary
whether,
should
a
state
refuse
to
fund
the
new
people,
the
secretary
will
cut
off
funding
for
the
new
people,
as
it's
obvious
the
state
doesn't
want
it,
and
whether
the
secretary
can
go
further.
i
also
should
think
--
i
could
not
find
one
case
where
the
secretary
ever
did
go
further,
but
i
also
would
think
that
the
secretary
could
not
go
further
where
going
further
would
be
an
unreasonable
thing
to
do,
since
government
action
is
governed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
since
it's
governed
by
the
general
principle,
it
must
always
be
reasonable.
so
i
want
to
know
where
this
idea
came
from
that
should
state
x
say,
"i
don't
want
the
new
money.
"
that
the
secretary
would
or
could
cut
off
the
old
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
let
me
relieve
you
of
that
concern,
and
tell
me
whether
i
have.
that
a
basic
principle
of
administrative
law,
indeed,
all
law,
is
that
the
government
must
act
reasonably.
and
should
a
secretary
cut
off
more
money
than
the
secretary
could
show
was
justified
by
being
causally
related
to
the
state's
refusal
to
take
the
new
money,
you
would
march
into
court
with
your
clients
and
say,
"judge,
the
secretary
here
is
acting
unreasonably,
and
i
believe
there
is
implicit
in
this
statute,
as
there
is
explicit
in
the
ada,
that
any
such
cut-off
decision
must
be
reasonable.
"
now,
does
that
relieve
you
of
your
fear?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
it
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
said
--
i
said
because
it
could
be,
you
know,
given
the
complexity
of
the
act,
that
there
is
some
money
that
would
be
saved
in
the
program
if
the
states
take
the
new
money,
and
if
they
don't
take
the
new
money
there
is
money
that
is
being
spent
that
wouldn't
otherwise
be
spent.
there
could
be
some
pile
like
that.
it
might
be
that
the
secretary
could
show
it
was
reasonable
to
take
that
money
away
from
the
states,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
point
is,
you
have
to
show
reasonableness
before
you
can
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
i
have
a
number
--
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
make
you
feel
a
little
better,
i
want
to
pursue
this
for
one
more
minute.
there
are
cases
and
many,
of
which
justice
scalia
knows
as
well,
which
uses
the
holly
hill,
uses
the
same
word
as
this
statute:
in
the
secretary's
discretion.
and
in
those
cases
this
court
has
said,
that
doesn't
mean
the
secretary
can
do
anything
that
he
or
she
wants,
but
rather,
they
are
limited
to
what
is
not
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
abuse
of
discretion
in
interpreting
statutes,
in
applying
those
statutes,
et
cetera.
end
of
my
argument;
end
of
my
question.
respond
as
you
wish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
the
government
can
reply
as
well
to
the
1980
extension
to
children
0
to
6
years
old,
1990
requiring
the
extension
for
children
up
to
18,
all
those
prior
extensions
to
me
seem
just
as
big
in
amount,
just
about
as
big
in
the
number
of
people
coming
on
the
rolls,
and
they
are
all
governed
by
precisely
the
same
statute
that
you
are
complaining
of
here,
which
has
been
in
the
law
since
'65.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
tell
you
this
number,
which
i
did
look
up,
that
the
amount,
approximately,
if
you
look
into
it
--
as
a
percentage
of
gdp,
it's
big,
but
it
was
before
this
somewhere
about
2-point-something
percent,
fairly
low,
of
gdp.
it'll
go
up
to
something
a
little
bit
over
3
percent
of
gdp.
and
now
go
look
at
the
comparable
numbers,
which
i
did
look
at,
with
the
expansion
that
we're
talking
about
before.
the
expansion
from
0
to
18
or
even
from
0
to
6.
and
while
you
can
argue
those
numbers,
it's
pretty
hard
to
argue
that
they
aren't
roughly
comparable
as
a
percentage
of
the
prior
program
or
as
a
percentage
of
gdp.
if
i'm
right
on
those
numbers
or
even
roughly
right
--
i
don't
guarantee
them
--
then
would
you
have
to
say,
well,
indeed,
medicaid
has
been
unconstitutional
since
1964.
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
just
before
you
leave
that,
i'd
--
i'd
appreciate
it
if
you
would
expand
a
little
bit
on
the
answer
to
justice
kagan's
question.
for
the
reason,
when
i
read
the
cutoff
statute,
which
as
i
said
has
been
there
since
1965
unchanged,
it
does
refer
to
the
secretary's
discretion
to
keep
the
funding,
insofar
as
the
funding
has
no
relationship
to
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
condition.
and
as
i
read
that,
that
gives
the
secretary
the
authority
to
cut
off
all
the
money,
but
the
state's
refusal
to
accept
the
condition
means
they
shouldn't
have.
but
nothing
there
says
they
can
go
beyond
that
and
cut
off
unrelated
money.
now
there
is
a
sentence
says
maybe
they
could
do
that.
i
thought
they
had
to
exercise
that
within
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
when
it
be
reasonable.
so
you
have
looked
into
it,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
--
i
could
find
no
instance
where
they
went
beyond
the
funds
that
were
related
to
the
thing
that
the
state
refused
to
do,
or
things
affected
by
that.
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me,
when
you
looked
into
it,
that
what
i
thought
of
in
this
isolation
chamber
here
is
actually
true.
or
whether
they
have
run
around
threatening
people
that
we
will
cut
off
totally
unrelated
funds.
what
is
the
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
know
if
that's
so.
and
all
i
asked
in
my
question
was
i
didn't
ask
you
to
commit
the
secretary
to
anything.
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
found
in
researching
this
case.
i
wanted
you
to,
in
other
words,
to
answer
the
question
the
chief
justice
has:
is
it
a
common
thing,
that
that
happens,
that
this
unrelated
threat
is
made?
or
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
are
not
privy
to
what
those
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
different?
i
mean,
i
thought
it
might
be
very
unlikely
that
the
state
would
ever
say
that
the
government
--
the
federal
government
would
say
here's
a
condition
that
you
have
to
have
a
certain
kind
of
eyeglasses
for
people
who
don't
see.
and
by
the
way
if
you
don't
do
that
we'll
take
away
$42
billion
of
funding,
okay?
i
thought
such
a
thing
would
not
happen.
and
i
thought
that
if
it
tried
to
happen
that
it's
governed
by
the
apa
and
the
person
with
eyeglasses
would
say
it's
arbitrary,
capricious,
abusive
discretion.
and
that's
so,
even
though
the
statute
says
it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
but
mr.
--
your
colleague
and
brother
says
no,
i'm
wrong
about
the
law
there
and
moreover
they
would
do
it.
that's
what
i'm
hearing
now,
that
they
would
do
it
and
they
do
do
it,
and
--
and,
etc.
so
i
would
like
a
little
clarification.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
making
you
reluctant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
do.
