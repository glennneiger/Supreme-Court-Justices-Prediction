mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
issues
of
great
moment,
and
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
bar
the
court's
consideration
of
those
issues.
that
is
so
even
though
the
anti-injunction
act
is
a
jurisdictional
limit
that
serves
what
this
court
described
in
clintwood
elkhorn
as
an
exceedingly
strong
interest
in
protecting
the
financial
stability
of
the
federal
government,
and
even
though
the
minimum
coverage
provision
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
an
exercise
of
congress's
taxing
power
as
well
as
its
commerce
power.
congress
has
authority
under
the
taxing
power
to
enact
a
measure
not
labeled
as
a
tax,
and
it
did
so
when
it
put
section
5000a
into
the
internal
revenue
code.
but
for
purposes
of
the
anti-injunction
act,
the
precise
language
congress
used
is
determinative.
and
there
is
no
language
in
the
anti-injunction
act
--
excuse
me,
no
language
in
section
5000a
of
the
affordable
care
act
or
in
the
internal
revenue
code
generally
that
provides
a
textual
instruction
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no,
justice
alito,
but
the
court
has
held
in
a
license
tax
cases
that
something
can
be
a
constitutional
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
whether
or
not
it
is
called
a
tax.
and
that's
because
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
that
we
will
conduct
tomorrow
is
different
from
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
that
we
will
conduct
today.
tomorrow
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
the
authority
under
the
taxing
power
to
enact
it
and
the
form
of
words
doesn't
have
a
dispositive
effect
on
that
analysis.
today
we
are
construing
statutory
text
where
the
precise
choice
of
words
does
have
a
dispositive
effect
on
the
analysis.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes.
i
do
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that,
with
respect
to
one
of
the
arguments
that
my
friend
from
the
nfib
has
made
in
the
brief,
that
bailey
v.
george
is
a
significant
problem
because
i
think
their
argument
on
the
constitutionality
under
the
taxing
power
is
essentially
that
the
affordable
care
act
provision
is
the
same
thing
as
the
provision
that
was
held
unconstitutional
in
bailey
v.
drexel
furniture
company.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
on
the
same
day
--
right,
but
on
the
same
day
as
bailey
v.
drexel
furniture,
the
court
issued
bailey
v.
george,
which
held
that
the
anti-injunction
act
did
bar
a
challenge
to
that
provision,
even
though
the
court
had
concluded
that
it
was
invalid
under
the
tax
power.
so
--
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
has
been
--
is
clear
now
after
williams
packing
and
bob
jones,
in
that
in
order
to
find
that
the
anti-injunction
act
doesn't
apply
to
something
that
otherwise
would
be
a
tax
that
triggers
it,
you
have
to
conclude
essentially
that
there
is
no
substantial
argument
that
can
be
made
in
defense
of
it
as
a
tax.
we
don't
have
that
here,
so
i
don't
think
you
can
get
around
the
anti-injunction
act
if
the
court
were
to
read
it,
as
the
amicus
suggest
it
should
be
read,
on
that
theory.
but.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no.
i
--
i
apologize
if
i'm
creating
confusion
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
we
think
by
far
the
better
route
here
is
to
understand
the
statute
as
we
have
proposed
that
it
be
construed
as
not
applying
here.
from
the
perspective
of
the
united
states
--
and
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
take
a
minute
on
this
--
the
idea
that
the
anti-injunction
act
would
be
construed
as
not
being
a
jurisdictional
provision
is
very
troubling,
and
we
don't
think
it's
correct.
and
i
--
i
would,
if
i
could
follow
up
on
a
question,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you
asked
mr.
long
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
anti-injunction
act
7421(a),
which
can
be
found
at
page
16a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
i
--
i'd
ask
the
court
to
compare
that
to
the
language
of
the
very
next
provision
in
the
code,
which
is
on
the
next
page
of
our
statutory
appendix,
17a,
which
is
the
refund
statute
which
we've
talked
about
a
little
bit
so
far
this
morning,
7422(a).
the
refund
statute
this
court
held
in
dolan
was
jurisdictional,
and
the
court
in
both
dolan
and
brockamp
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
the
refund
statute
cases
is
jurisdictional.
the
language
in
7422(a)
is
virtually
identical
to
the
language
in
7421(a)--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
--
originally,
they
were
the
same
statutory
provision.
they
were
only
separated
out
later.
so
i
do
think
that's
the
strongest
textual
indication,
justice
ginsburg,
that
--
that
7421(a)
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes,
that
is
exactly
our
position.
and
the
reason
we
don't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--there
would
be
no
reason
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
justice
kennedy,
i
think
we
all
want
to
know
the
answer
to
a
lot
of
things
in
this
case.
but
--
but
i
do
--
i
do
think
that
the
prudent
course
here
is
to
construe
the
statute
in
the
manner
that
we
read
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
think
there
are
two
problems.
one
is
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
identified,
that
if
it's
not
jurisdictional,
then
courts
have
authority
to
craft
equitable
exceptions.
and
it
may
seem
from
where
we
stand
now
that
that
authority
is
or
could
be
very,
very
tightly
cabined,
but
if
--
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
it
isn't
jurisdictional,
that
does
empower
courts
to
find
other
circumstances
in
which
they
might
find
it
equitable
to
allow
cases
to
go
forward
in
the
absence
of
--
of
--
despite
the
existence
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
and
second,
although
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
stand
up
here
and
disparage
the
attorneys
from
the
united
states
in
the
slightest,
the
reality
is
that
if
this
isn't
jurisdictional,
then
it's
--
the
argument
--
it's
open
to
the
argument
that
it's
subject
to
forfeiture
by
a
simple
omission
in
failing
to
raise
it
in
an
answer.
and
that
--
and
that's
a
troubling
prospect.
by--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that's
--
that
is
not
our
assessment
of
the
institutional
interests
of
the
united
states,
justice
ginsburg.
and
we
do
think
that
the
--
the
right
way
to
go
in
this
case
is
to
read
the
statute
as
not
applying
to
the
minimum
coverage
provision
of
the
affordable
care
act.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
several
points
about
that,
though.
we
do
agree
with
mr.
long's
analysis
that
davis
occurred
in
--
during
a
time
in
--
which
under
the
standard
nut
case,
the
court
had
interpreted
the
anti-injunction
act
as
doing
no
more
than
codifying
the
traditional
equitable
principles
which
allowed
courts
discretion
to
conclude
that
in
certain
circumstances,
a
case
could
go
forward.
williams
packing
repudiated
that
analysis,
and
bob
jones
v.
simon
again
repudiated
that
analysis
and
said,
no,
we're
no
longer
abiding
by
that.
it
is
true
that
the
davis
case
has
not
formally
been
overruled,
but
we
do
think
it's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
court's
understanding
now
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
in
fairness,
justice
breyer,
the
united
states
did
intervene
in
the
--
in
the
davis
case
and
was
a
party,
and
so
--
not
as
far
as
i'd
like,
i
guess
is
the
answer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
our
view
here
is
that
it
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kagan.
first,
we
think
--
i
guess
i'm
repeating
myself
and
i
apologize,
but
--
we
think
the
closest
analogue
is
the
very
next
provision
in
the
united
states
code,
7422(a),
which
this
court
has
held
is
jurisdictional,
and
is
phrased
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
7421(a).
in
fact,
as
i
said,
they
were
the
same
provision
back
in
the
earlier
days.
that's
the
closest
analogue.
this
isn't
--
and
it's
actually
7422
that's
a
statute
that
says
do
something
first.
but
this
--
this
statute
is
just
a
flat-out
command
that
no
suit
shall
be
maintained
to
restrain--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--the
assessment
or
collection.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
because
the
--
the
--
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
is
there
are
no
magic
words.
and
that
history
and
context
matter,
as
the
court
said
in
henderson.
and
the
history
and
context
here
is
that
7422
and
7421
function
together
to
protect
an
exceedingly
strong
interest
that
--
that
the
court
has
held
with
respect
to
7422
sufficiently
strong
that
it
--
it
explains
the
jurisdictional
nature
of
that.
the
same
interest
applies
here.
this
isn't
just
a
matter
of
do
x
and
then
you
can
--
and
then
you
can
come
to
court.
it's
just
a
fundamentally
different
set
of
interests
at
stake.
so
we
--
we
do
think
that
that
makes
a
big
difference.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it
is
--
we
do
think
it's
very
much
in
--
in
that
nature
and
different
from
this
case,
your
honor.
and
one
--
one
way
i
think
it's
helpful
to
--
to
get
at
this
is
--
is
to
look
at
the
history.
we've
cited
a
string
of
court
of
appeals
cases
in
a
footnote
in
our
opening
brief,
and
over
time,
it's
been
very
consistent
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
treated
the
anti-injunction
act
as
a
jurisdictional
provision.
again,
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
statutory
construction,
you
don't
need
to
reach
this
issue.
but
they
have
--
in
fact,
one
of
those
cases,
the
hansen
case,
the
district
court
in
that
case
had
dismissed
the
complaint
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
12(b)(6).
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
and
sent
it
back
with
instructions
to
dismiss
under
12(b)(1),
which
is
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
provision.
so
i
do
think
that,
to
the
extent
this
issue
is
before
the
court,
it
is
jurisdictional,
but
it
doesn't
need
to
be
before
the
court
because
of
the
statutory
construction
argument
that
we
had
offered.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
it's
not
quite
out
there
all
by
itself.
there
are
other
provisions
that
fall
outside
of
subchapter
b
of
chapter
68
and,
therefore,
wouldn't
be
governed
by
the
instruction
in
section
6671(a),
which
answers
the
question
about
the
applicability
of
the
act
for
most
penalties.
the
ones
that
we've
identified,
and
i
may
be
overlapping
a
little
bit
with
mr.
long
here,
one
is
26
u.s.c.
857,
which
poses
certain
penalties
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
real
estate
investment
trusts.
there
are
provisions
that
mr.
long
identified
in
his
brief,
sections
6038(a)
through
(c)
of
the
code,
which
impose
certain
penalties
with
respect
to
reporting
requirements
for
foreign
corporations.
we
have,
in
addition,
in
footnote
22
at
page
36
of
our
brief,
identified
three
provisions
that
mr.
long
also
identified
about
--
about
alcohol
and
tobacco.
now--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes.
that
is
not
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute,
justice
sotomayor.
the
only
consequence
that
ensues
is
the
tax
penalty.
and
the
--
we
have
made
a
representation,
and
it
was
a
carefully
made
representation,
in
our
brief
that
it
is
the
interpretation
of
the
agencies
charged
with
interpreting
this
statute,
the
treasury
department
and
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
that
there
is
no
other
consequence
apart
from
the
tax
penalty.
and
i
do
think,
if
i
could
talk
for
a
couple
of
minutes
about
the
argument
that
was
discussed
as
to
whether
this
can
be
conceived
of
as
a
suit
just
challenging
the
requirement,
which
is
entirely
stand-alone
based
on
inferences
drawn
from
the
exemptions.
i
really
don't
think
that's
right.
and
if
i
could
spend
a
minute
on
it,
i
think
it's
important.
the
exemptions
in
section
5000a,
it
is
true
that
there
are
two
categories
of
exemptions.
there
are
exemptions
to
the
penalty
and
exemptions
to
the
subsection
(a)
requirement.
but
the
--
but
i
think,
not
only
as
a
practical
matter,
but
as
a
textural
indication
and
even
as
a
legal
matter,
they
--
both
function
as
exceptions
to
the
requirement.
first,
as
a
practical
matter,
one
of
those
exemptions
is
a
hardship
exemption.
and
if
the
court
will
just
bear
with
me
for
one
minute
here,
it's
at
page
11a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it
provides
that
a
person
can
go
to
the
secretary
of
hhs
and
obtain
a
hardship
exemption
for
--
which
would,
as
a
formal
matter
here,
excuse
compliance
with
the
penalty.
it
seems
to
me
to
make
very
little
sense
to
say
that
someone
who
has
gone
to
an
official
of
the
united
states
and
obtained
an
exemption
would,
nonetheless,
be
in
a
position
of
being
a
law
breaker.
we
think
another
way
in
which
you
can
get
to
the
same
conclusion
slightly
differently
is
by
considering
the
provision
on
the
prior
page,
10a,
which
is
5000a
--
5000a(e)(3),
members
of
indian
tribes.
members
of
indian
tribes
are
exempt
only
from
the
penalty
as
a
formal
matter
under
the
structure
of
the
statute
here;
but,
the
reason
for
that
is
because
members
of
indian
tribes
obtain
their
healthcare
through
the
indian
health
service,
which
is
a
clinic-based
system
that
doesn't
involve
insurance
at
all.
it's
an
entirely
different
system.
they
were
taken
out
of
this
statute
because
they
get
their
healthcare
through
a
different
system.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
think
that
persons
getting
their
health
care
through
the
indian
health
service
are
violating
the
law
because
--
exempt
only
from
the
penalty,
but
still
under
a
legal
obligation
to
have
insurance,
when
the
whole
point
of
this
is
that
they're
supposed
to
be
in
a
clinic-based
system.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
guess
what
i
would
say
about
it,
your
honor,
is
that
the
way
in
which
this
statute
is
drafted
doesn't
permit
the
inference
that
my
friends
from
the
nib
are
trying
to
draw
from
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
correct.
and
we
think
that
is
what
congress
is
saying,
both
in
the
provision
i
just
pointed
to,
your
honor,
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
--
by
virtue
of
the
way
the
exemptions
work.
i
just
think
that's
the
--
reading
this
in
context,
that
is
the
stronger
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
easy
for
the
government
in
the
future.
we
think
this
is
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute,
that
the
--
that
the
--
you
cannot
infer
from
the
fact
that
someone
is
exempt
from
the
penalty,
that
they
are
still
under
an
obligation
to
have
insurance.
that's
just
not
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no.
our
position
is
that
person
should
give
the
answer
"no".
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
if
they
don't
pay
the
tax,
they
violated
a
federal
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
if
they
pay
the
tax,
then
they
are
in
compliance
with
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
if
they
pay
the
tax
penalty,
they're
in
compliance
with
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
right.
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
for
the
same
reason
i
just
gave.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
answer
in
that
situation
is
that
that
person,
assuming
that
person
--
well,
if
that
person
is
eligible
for
medicaid,
they
may
well
not
be
in
a
situation
where
they
are
going
to
face
any
tax
penalty
and
therefore--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--right,
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
do
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
certainly
fair
to
say
that
congress
wants
people
in
that
position
to
sign
up
for
medicaid.
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
and
i
think
the
statute
is
structured
to
accomplish
that
objective;
but,
the
reality
still
is
that
the
only
consequence
of
noncompliance
is
the
penalty.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
it
all
--
the
penalty
is
keyed
to
income.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
and
it's
keyed
to
a
number
of
things.
one
is,
are
--
are
you
making
so
little
money
that
you
aren't
obligated
to
file
a
tax
return.
and
if
you're
in
that
situation,
you
are
not
subject
to
the
penalty.
it's
also
if
the
cost
of
insurance
would
be
more
than
8
percent
of
your
income,
you're
not
subject
to
the
penalty.
so
there
--
there
--
there
isn't
necessarily
a
precise
mapping
between
somebody's
income
level
and
their
medicaid
eligibility
at
the
present
moment.
that
will
depend
on
where
things
are
and
what
the
eligibility
requirements
are
in
the
state.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
as
a
general
matter,
for
people
below
the
poverty
line
it's
almost
inconceivable
that
they
are
ever
going
to
be
subject
to
the
penalty,
and
they
would,
after
the
act'smedicaid
reforms
go
into
place,
be
eligible
for
medicaid.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
the
essence
they
called
it
a
penalty.
they
didn't
give
any
other
textural
instruction
in
the
affordable
care
act
or
in
the
internal
revenue
code
or
that
that
penalty
should
be
treated
as
a
tax
for
the
anti-injunction
act
purpose.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
it
will
--
well,
it
will
raise
revenue.
it
has
been
predicted
by
the
cbo
that
it
will
raise
revenue,
your
honor.
but
even
though
that's
the
case,
and
i
think
that
would
be
true
of
any
--
of
any
penalty,
that
it
will
raise
some
revenue,
but
even
though
that's
the
case,
there
still
needs
to
be
textural
instruction
in
the
statute
that
this
penalty
should
be
treated
as
a
tax
for
anti-injunction
act
purposes,
and
that's
what
is
lacking
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
those
are
two
different
things,
justice
alito.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes.
we
don't
--
you
know
--
we've
--
we've
taken
this
position,
after
very
careful
consideration,
and
we've
assessed
the
institutional
interests
of
the
united
states
and
we
think
we
are
in
the
right
place.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
because
we
don't
--
because
the
exhaustion
would
go
to
the
individual
amount
owed,
we
think,
and
that's
a
different
situation
from
this
case.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
thank
you.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
affordable
care
act
addresses
a
fundamental
and
enduring
problem
in
our
health
care
system
and
our
economy.
insurance
has
become
the
predominant
means
of
paying
for
health
care
in
this
country.
for
most
americans,
for
more
than
80
percent
of
americans,
the
insurance
system
does
provide
effective
access.
excuse
me.
but
for
more
than
40
million
americans
who
do
not
have
access
to
health
insurance
either
through
their
employer
or
through
government
programs
such
as
medicare
or
medicaid,
the
system
does
not
work.
those
individuals
must
resort
to
the
individual
market,
and
that
market
does
not
provide
affordable
health
insurance.
it
does
not
do
so
because,
because
the
multibillion
dollar
subsidies
that
are
available
for
the,
the
employer
market
are
not
available
in
the
individual
market.
it
does
not
do
so
because
erisa
and
hipaa
regulations
that
preclude,
that
preclude
discrimination
against
people
based
on
their
medical
history
do
not
apply
in
the
individual
market.
that
is
an
economic
problem.
and
it
begets
another
economic
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
they
can
address
it
directly,
justice
scalia,
and
they
are
addressing
it
directly
through
this,
through
this
act
by
regulating
the
means
by
which
health
care,
by
which
health
care
is
purchased.
that
is
the
way
this
act
works.
under
the
commerce
clause,
what,
what
congress
has
done
is
to
enact
reforms
of
the
insurance
market,
directed
at
the
individual
insurance
market,
that
preclude,
that
preclude
discrimination
based
on
pre-existing
conditions,
that
require
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating,
and
it
uses
--
and
the
minimum
coverage
provision
is
necessary
to
carry
into
execution
those
insurance
reforms.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
not
what's
going
on
here,
justice
kennedy,
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
defend
the
law
on
that
basis.
in
this
case,
the
--
what
is
being
regulated
is
the
method
of
financing
health,
the
purchase
of
health
care.
that
itself
is
economic
activity
with
substantial
effects
on
interstate
commerce.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no.
that's
not
our
position
at
all,
justice
scalia.
in
the
health
care
market,
the
health
care
market
is
characterized
by
the
fact
that
aside
from
the
few
groups
that
congress
chose
to
exempt
from
the
minimum
coverage
requirement
--
those
who
for
religious
reasons
don't
participate,
those
who
are
incarcerated,
indian
tribes
--
virtually
everybody
else
is
either
in
that
market
or
will
be
in
that
market,
and
the
distinguishing
feature
of
that
is
that
they
cannot,
people
cannot
generally
control
when
they
enter
that
market
or
what
they
need
when
they
enter
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that's
different.
it's
--
we
--
i
don't
think
we
think
of
that
as
a
market.
this
is
a
market.
this
is
market
regulation.
and
in
addition,
you
have
a
situation
in
this
market
not
only
where
people
enter
involuntarily
as
to
when
they
enter
and
won't
be
able
to
control
what
they
need
when
they
enter
but
when
they--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
think
the
fundamental
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
that's
not
an
issue
of
market
regulation.
this
is
an
issue
of
market
regulation,
and
that's
how
congress,
that's
how
congress
looked
at
this
problem.
there
is
a
market.
insurance
is
provided
through
the
market
system--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--for
burial
services?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes,
justice
alito,
i
think
there
is.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it's,
i
think
it's
completely
different.
the
--
and
the
reason
is
that
the,
the
burial
example
is
not
--
the
difference
is
here
we
are
regulating
the
method
by
which
you
are
paying
for
something
else
--
health
care
--
and
the
insurance
requirement
--
i
think
the
key
thing
here
is
my
friends
on
the
other
side
acknowledge
that
it
is
within
the
authority
of
congress
under
article
i
under
the
commerce
power
to
impose
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating
forms,
to
end
--
to
impose
a
minimum
coverage
provision.
their
argument
is
just
that
it
has
to
occur
at
the
point
of
sale,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
one
big
difference,
one
big
difference,
justice
alito,
is
the
--
you
don't
have
the
cost
shifting
to
other
market
participants.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
different.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that's
a
difference
and
it's
a
significant
difference.
in
this
situation
one
of
the
economic
effects
congress
is
addressing
is
that
the
--
there
--
the
many
billions
of
dollars
of
uncompensated
costs
are
transferred
directly
to
other
market
participants.
it's
transferred
directly
to
other
market
participants
because
health
care
providers
charge
higher
rates
in
order
to
cover
the
cost
of
uncompensated
care,
and
insurance
companies
reflect
those
higher
rates
in
higher
premiums,
which
congress
found
translates
to
a
thousand
dollars
per
family
in
additional
health
insurance
costs.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
i
think
that
--
i
do
think
that's
what
the
respondents
argue.
it's
just
not
right.
i
think
it
--
it
really
gets
to
a
fundamental
problem
with
their
argument.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
a,
it
is
how
insurance
works,
but,
b,
the
problem
that
they
--
that
they
are
identifying
is
not
that
problem.
the
--
the
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating
reforms
do
not
have
the
effect
of
forcing
insurance
companies
to
take
on
lots
of
additional
people
who
they
then
can't
afford
to
cover
because
they're
--
they
tend
to
be
the
sick,
and
that
is
--
in
fact,
the
exact
opposite
is
what
happens
here.
the
--
when
--
when
you
enact
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating
reforms
and
you
do
so
in
the
absence
of
a
minimum
coverage
provision,
it's
not
that
insurance
companies
take
on
more
and
more
people
and
then
need
a
subsidy
to
cover
it,
it's
that
fewer
and
fewer
people
end
up
with
insurance
because
their
rates
are
not
regulated.
insurance
companies,
when
--
when
they
have
to
offer
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating,
they
are
entitled
to
make
a
profit.
they
charge
rates
sufficient
to
cover
only
the
sick
population
because
health--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--so
two
things
about
that,
justice
kennedy.
first,
we
think
this
is
regulation
of
people's
participation
in
the
health
care
market,
and
all
--
all
this
minimum
coverage
provision
does
is
say
that,
instead
of
requiring
insurance
at
the
point
of
sale,
that
congress
has
the
authority
under
the
commerce
power
and
the
necessary
proper
power
to
ensure
that
people
have
insurance
in
advance
of
the
point
of
sale
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
this
market,
because
this
is
a
market
in
which
--
in
which
you
--
although
most
of
the
population
is
in
the
market
most
of
the
time
--
83
percent
visit
a
physician
every
year;
96
percent
over
a
five-year
period
--
so
virtually
everybody
in
society
is
in
this
market,
and
you've
got
to
pay
for
the
health
care
you
get,
the
predominant
way
in
which
it's
--
in
which
it's
paid
for
is
insurance,
and
--
and
the
respondents
agree
that
congress
could
require
that
you
have
insurance
in
order
to
get
health
care
or
forbid
health
care
from
being
provided--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
you
never
know
whether
you're
going
to
be
that
person.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no,
that's
quite
different.
that's
quite
different.
the
food
market,
while
it
shares
that
trait
that
everybody's
in
it,
it
is
not
a
market
in
which
your
participation
is
often
unpredictable
and
often
involuntary.
it
is
not
a
market
in
which
you
often
don't
know
before
you
go
in
what
you
need,
and
it
is
not
a
market
in
which,
if
you
go
in
and
--
and
seek
to
obtain
a
product
or
service,
you
will
get
it
even
if
you
can't
pay
for
it.
it
doesn't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes,
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
--
the
test,
as
this
court
has
articulated
it,
is:
is
congress
regulating
economic
activity
with
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce?
the
way
in
which
this
statute
satisfies
the
test
is
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
that
i
have
identified.
if--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
is
--
and
that
is
definitely
a
difference
that
distinguishes
this
market
and
justifies
this
as
a
regulation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it
does,
justice
breyer,
and
if
congress
were
to
enact
laws
like
that,
we--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
my
responsibility
--
and
i
would
defend
them
on
a
rationale
like
that,
but
i
do
think
that
we
are
advancing
a
narrower
rationale.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes.
the
--
the
rationale
purely
under
the
commerce
clause
that
we're
advocating
here
would
not
justify
forced
purchases
of
commodities
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
demand.
we
--
the
--
it
would
not
justify
purchases
of
insurance
for
the
purposes
--
in
situations
in
which
insurance
doesn't
serve
as
the
method
of
payment
for
service--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no.
the,
the
--
we
think
that
in
a
--
when
--
the
difference
between
those
situations
and
this
situation
is
that
in
those
situations,
your
honor,
congress
would
be
moving
to
create
commerce.
here
congress
is
regulating
existing
commerce,
economic
activity
that
is
already
going
on,
people's
participation
in
the
health
care
market,
and
is
regulating
to
deal
with
existing
effects
of
existing
commerce.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
the
difference,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
health
insurance
is
the
means
of
payment
for
health
care
and
broccoli
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
--
and
broccoli
is
not
the
means
of
payment
for
anything
else.
and
an
automobile
is
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
i
do
think
that's
the
difference
between
existing
commerce
activity
in
the
market
already
occurring
--the
people
in
the
health
care
market
purchasing,
obtaining
health
careservices
--
and
the
creation
of
commerce.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that
--
that
absolutely
is
a
justification
for
congress's
action
here.
that
is
existing
economic
activity
that
congress
is
regulating
by
means
of
this
rule.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
is
not
what
we
are
saying,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
not
--
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no.
it's
because
you're
going
--
in
the
health
care
market,
you're
going
into
the
market
without
the
ability
to
pay
for
what
you
get,
getting
the
health
care
service
anyway
as
a
result
of
the
social
norms
that
allow
--
that
--
to
which
we've
obligated
ourselves
so
that
people
get
health
care.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i
can't
imagine
that
that
--
that
the
commerce
clause
would
--
would
forbid
congress
from
taking
into
account
this
deeply
embedded
social
norm.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
--
i
--
this
is
not
a
purchase
mandate.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
law
that
regulates
the
method
of
paying
for
a
service
that
the
class
of
people
to
whom
it
applies
are
either
consuming--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
or
--
or
inevitably
will
consume.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
so,
let
me
try
to
state
it
this
way.
the
congress
enacted
reforms
of
the
insurance
market,
the
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating
reforms.
it
did
so
to
deal
with
a
very
serious
problem
that
results
in
40
million
people
not
being
able
to
get
insurance
and
therefore
not
access
to
the
health
care
market.
everybody
agrees
in
this
case
that
those
are
within
congress's
article
i
powers.
the
minimum
coverage
provision
is
necessary
to
carry
those
provisions
into
--
into
execution;
because
without
them,
without
those
provisions,
without
minimum
coverage,
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating
will,
as
the
experience
in
the
states
showed,
make
matters
worse,
not
better.
there
will
be
fewer
people
covered;
it
will
cost
more.
now
the
--
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--so
--
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no.
because
that's
--
that's
the
first
part
of
our
argument.
the
second
part
of
our
argument
is
that
the
means
here
that
the
congress
has
chosen,
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
is
a
means
that
regulates
the
--
that
regulates
economic
activity,
namely
your
transaction
in
the
health
care
market,
with
substantial
effects
on
interstate
commerce;
and
it
is
the
conjunction
of
those
two
that
we
think
provides
the
particularly
secure
foundation
for
this
statute
under
the
commerce
power.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
do
think,
justice
kagan,
that
the
point
of
difference
between
my
friends
on
the
other
side
and
the
united
states
is
about
one
of
timing.
they
have
agreed
that
congress
has
article
i
authority
to
impose
an
insurance
requirement
or
other
--
or
other
penalty
at
the
point
of
sale,
and
they
have
agreed
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
do
that
to
achieve
the
same
objectives
that
the
minimum
coverage
provision
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
designed
to
achieve.
this
is
a
situation
if
which
we
are
talking
about
means.
congress
gets
a
substantial
deference
in
the
choice
of
means,
and
if
one
thinks
about
the
difference
between
the
means
they
say
congress
should
have
chosen
and
the
means
congress
did
choose,
i
think
you
can
see
why
it
was
eminently
more
sensible
for
congress
to
choose
the
means
that
it
chose.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
let
me
try
to
answer
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
and
get
back
to
the
question
you
asked
me
earlier.
the,
the
--
i
do
think
one
striking
feature
of
the
argument
here
that
this
is
a
novel
exercise
of
power
is
that
what
congress
chose
to
do
was
to
rely
on
market
mechanisms
and
efficiency
and
a
method
that
has
more
choice
than
would
the
traditional
medicare/medicaid
type
model;
and
so
it
seems
a
little
ironic
to
suggest
that
that
counts
against
it.
but
beyond
that,
in
the
sense
that
it's
novel,
this
provision
is
novel
in
the
same
way,
or
unprecedented
in
the
same
way,
that
the
sherman
act
was
unprecedented
when
the
court
upheld
it
in
the
northern
securities
case;
or
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
was
unprecedented
when
the
court
upheld
it,
or
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
unprecedented
when
the
court
upheld
it
in
jones
and
laughlin;
or
the
--
the
dairy
price
supports
in
wrightwood
dairy
and
rock
royal--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
to
the
extent
that
we
are
looking
at
the
comprehensive
scheme,
justice
scalia,
it
is
regulating
commerce
that
already
exists
out
there.
and
the
means
in
which
that
regulation
is
made
effective
here,
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
is
a
regulation
of
the
way
in
which
people
participate,
the
method
of
their
payment
in
the
health
care
market.
that
is
what
it
is.
and
i
do
think,
justice
kennedy,
getting
back
to
the
question
you
asked
before,
what
--
what
matters
here
is
whether
congress
is
choosing
a
tool
that's
reasonably
adapted
to
the
problem
that
congress
is
confronting.
and
that
may
mean
that
the
tool
is
different
from
a
tool
that
congress
has
chosen
to
use
in
the
past.
that's
not
something
that
counts
against
the
provision
in
a
commerce
clause
analysis.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
this
does
not
violate
the
norm
of
proper
as
this
court
articulated
it
in
printz
or
in
new
york
because
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
states
as
sovereigns.
this
is
a
regulation
that
--
this
is
a
regulation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--of
course
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
and
the
way
in
which
this
court
in
its
cases
has
policed
the
boundary
that
--
of
what's
in
the
national
sphere
and
what's
in
the
local
sphere
is
to
ask
whether
congress
is
regulating
economic
activity
with
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
and
here
i
think
it's
really
impossible,
in
view
of
our
history,
to
say
that
congress
is
invading
the
state
sphere.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
market
in
which
50
percent
of
the
people
in
this
country
get
their
health
care
through
their
employer.
there
is
a
massive
federal
tax
subsidy
of
$250
billion
a
year
that
makes
that
much
more
affordable.
erisa
and
hipaa
regulate
that
to
ensure
that
the
kinds
of
bans
on
pre-existing
condition
discrimination
and
pricing
practices
that
occur
in
the
individual
market
don't
occur.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
this
is
in--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
this
--
but,
your
honor,
this
is
--
what
the
court
has
said,
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
substantial
departure
from
what
the
court
has
said,
is
that
when
congress
is
regulating
economic
activity
with
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
that
will
be
upheld.
and
that
is
what
is
going
on
here,
and
to
embark
on
--
i
would
submit
with
all
due
respect,
to
embark
on
the
kind
of
analysis
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
suggest
the
court
ought
to
embark
on
is
to
import
lochner-style
substantive
due
process--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
agree,
except,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
what
the
court
has
said
as
i
read
the
court's
cases
is
that
the
way
in
which
you
ensure
that
the
federal
government
stays
in
its
sphere
and
the
sphere
reserved
for
the
states
is
protected
is
by
policing
the
boundary:
is
the
national
government
regulating
economic
activity
with
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
it
is
predicated
on
the
participation
of
these
individuals
in
the
market
for
health
care
services.
now,
it
happens
to
be
that
this
is
a
market
in
which,
aside
from
the
groups
that
the
statute
excludes,
virtually
everybody
participates.
but
it
is
a
regulation
of
their
participation
in
that
market.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
it's
part
of
what
the
statute
requires
the
insurers
to
offer.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
because
it's
trying
to
define
minimum
essential
coverage
because
the
problem--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--the
--
with
respect
to
what
insurance
has
to
cover,
your
honor,
i
think
congress
is
entitled
the
latitude
of
making
the
judgments
of
what
the
appropriate
scope
of
coverage
is.
and
the
problem
here
in
this
market
is
that
for
--
you
may
think
you're
perfectly
healthy
and
you
may
think
that
you're
not
--
that
you're
being
forced
to
subsidize
somebody
else,
but
this
is
not
a
market
in
which
you
can
say
that
there
is
a
immutable
class
of
healthy
people
who
are
being
forced
to
subsidize
the
unhealthy.
this
is
a
market
in
which
you
may
be
healthy
one
day
and
you
may
be
a
very
unhealthy
participant
in
that
market
the
next
day
and
that
is
a
fundamental
difference,
and
you're
not
going
to
know
in
which--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--congress
has
got
--
congress
is
enacting
economic
regulation
here.
it
has
latitude
to
define
essential,
the
attributes
of
essential
coverage.
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
implicate
the
question
of
whether
congress
is
engaging
in
economic
regulation
and
solving
an
economic
problem
here,
and
that
is
what
congress
is
doing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
while
they
are
young
and
healthy
that
would
be
true.
but
they
are
not
going
to
be
young
and
healthy
forever.
they
are
going
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
that
actuarial
equation
at
some
point.
and
of
course
you
don't
know
which
among
that
group
is
the
person
who's
going
to
be
hit
by
the
bus
or
get
the
definitive
diagnosis.
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
the
--
the
people
in
that
class
get
benefits,
too,
justice
alito.
they
get
the
guaranteed-issue
benefit
that
they
would
not
otherwise
have,
which
is
an
enormously
valuable
benefit.
and
in
terms
of
the
--
the
subsidy
rationale,
i
--
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it's
--
it
would
be
unusual
to
say
that
it's
an
illegitimate
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
for
some
people
to
subsidize
others.
telephone
rates
in
this
country
for
a
century
were
set
via
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
in
a
way
in
which
some
people
paid
rates
that
were
much
higher
than
their
costs
in
order
to
subsidize--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
right.
but
--
but
everybody
--
to
live
in
the
modern
world,
everybody
needs
a
telephone.
and
the
--
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
--
you
know,
the
dairy
price
supports
that
--
that
the
court
upheld
in
wrightwood
dairy
and
rock
royal.
you
can
look
at
those
as
disadvantageous
contracts,
as
forced
transfers,
that
--
you
know,
i
suppose
it's
theoretically
true
that
you
could
raise
your
kids
without
milk,
but
the
reality
is
you've
got
to
go
to
the
store
and
buy
milk.
and
the
commerce
power
--
as
a
result
of
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power,
you're
subsidizing
somebody
else--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--because
that's
the
judgment
congress
has
made.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
justice
kagan,
that
you're
young
and
healthy
one
day,
but
you
don't
stay
that
way.
and
the
--
the
system
works
over
time.
and
so
i
just
don't
think
it's
a
fair
characterization
of
it.
and
it
does
get
back
to,
i
think
--
a
problem
i
think
is
important
to
understand--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
--
that's
--
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that's
the
problem,
justice
scalia.
that's
--
and
that's
exactly
the
experience
that
the
states
had
that
made
the
imposition
of
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating
not
only
be
ineffectual
but
be
highly
counterproductive.
rates,
for
example,
in
new
jersey
doubled
or
tripled,
went
from
180,000
people
covered
in
this
market
down
to
80,000
people
covered
in
this
market.
in
kentucky,
virtually
every
insurer
left
the
market.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
when
people
have
that
guarantee
of
--
that
they
can
get
insurance,
they're
going
to
make
that
calculation
that
they
won't
get
it
until
they're
sick
and
they
need
it,
and
so
the
pool
of
people
in
the
insurance
market
gets
smaller
and
smaller.
the
rates
you
have
to
charge
to
cover
them
get
higher
and
higher.
it
helps
fewer
and
fewer
--
insurance
covers
fewer
and
fewer
people
until
the
system
ends.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
you're
conscripting
--
you're
forcing
insurance
companies
to
cover
very
large
numbers
of
unhealthy
people--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
that
seems
to
me
to
say,
justice
scalia,
that
congress
--
that's
the
problem
here.
and
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--congress
cannot
solve
the
problem
through
standard
economic
regulation,
and
that
--
and
--
and
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
the
premise
of
our
understanding
of
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--this
is
an
economic
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
this
is
not
a
--
it's
not
a
problem
of
congress's
creation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes.
it's
limited
to
insurance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
this
is
insurance
as
a
method
of
payment
for
health
care
services--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
that
--
and
that
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
answer
that,
and
then
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
move
to
the
tax
power
argument.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no.
the
--
the
position
we're
taking
here
would
not
justify
that
rule,
justice
scalia,
because
health
club
membership
is
not
a
means
of
payment
for
--
for
consumption
of
anything
in
--
in
a
market.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
i
think
it's
common
ground
between
us
and
the
respondents
that
this
is
an
interstate
market
in
which
everybody
participates.
and
they
agree
that
--
that
congress
could
impose
the
insurance
requirement
at
the
point
of
sale.
and
this
is
just
a
question
of
timing,
and
whether
congress's
--
whether
the
necessary
and
proper
authority
gives
congress,
because
of
the
particular
features
of
this
market,
the
ability
to
impose
the
--
the
insurance,
the
need
for
insurance,
the
maintenance
of
insurance
before
you
show
up
to
get
health
care
rather
than
at
the
moment
you
get
up
to
show--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--show
up
to
get
health
care.
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
we
agree
congress
can
regulate
this
market.
erisa
regulates
this
market.
hipaa
regulates
this
market.
the
--
the
market
is
regulated
at
the
federal
level
in
very
significant
ways
already.
so
i
don't
think
that's
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
limit
to
the
authority
that
we're
advocating
here
under
the
commerce
power,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
because
we
are
not
advocating
for
a
power
that
would
allow
congress
to
compel
purchases--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--we
got
two
and
they
are
--
they
are
different.
let
me
state
them.
first
with
respect
to
the
comprehensive
scheme.
when
congress
is
regulating
--
is
enacting
a
comprehensive
scheme
that
it
has
the
authority
to
enact
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
gives
it
the
authority
to
include
regulation,
including
a
regulation
of
this
kind,
if
it
is
necessary
to
counteract
risks
attributable
to
the
scheme
itself
that
people
engage
in
economic
activity
that
would
undercut
the
scheme.
it's
like
--
it's
very
much
like
wickard
in
that
respect,
very
much
like
raich
in
that
respect.
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
--
considering
the
commerce
clause
alone
and
not
embedded
in
the
comprehensive
scheme,
our
position
is
that
congress
can
regulate
the
method
of
payment
by
imposing
an
insurance
requirement
in
advance
of
the
time
in
which
the
--
the
service
is
consumed
when
the
class
to
which
that
requirement
applies
either
is
or
virtually
is
most
certain
to
be
in
that
market
when
the
timing
of
one's
entry
into
that
market
and
what
you
will
need
when
you
enter
that
market
is
uncertain
and
when
--
when
you
will
get
the
care
in
that
market,
whether
you
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
or
not
and
shift
costs
to
other
market
participants.
so
those
--
those
are
our
views
as
to
--
those
are
the
principles
we
are
advocating
for
and
it's,
in
fact,
the
conjunction
of
the
two
of
them
here
that
makes
this,
we
think,
a
strong
case
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i
think
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
license
tax
case,
where
it
was
--
was
denominated
a
fee
and
nontax,
and
the
court
upheld
it
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power,
in
a
situation
in
which
the
structure
of
the
law
was
very
much
like
the
structure
of
this
law,
in
that
there
was
a
separate
stand-alone
provision
that
set
the
predicate
and
then
a
separate
provision
in
posing
the
fees--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
that,
and
--
and
i
think
in
terms
of
the
tax
part,
i
think
it's
useful
to
separate
this
into
two
questions.
one
is
a
question
of
characterization.
can
this
be
characterized
as
a
tax;
and
second,
is
it
a
constitutional
exercise
of
the
power?
with
respect
to
the
question
of
characterization,
the
--
this
is
--
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
is
administered
by
the
irs,
it
is
paid
on
your
form
1040
on
april
15th,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--they
may
still
be
exercise
of
the
tax
--
exercises
of
the
taxing
power,
justice
ginsburg,
as
--
as
this
is,
and
i
think
there
isn't
a
case
in
which
the
court
has,
to
my
mind,
suggested
anything
that
bears
this
many
indicia
of
a
tax
can't
be
considered
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
the
license
tax
cases
point
you
in
the
opposite
direction.
and
beyond
that
your
--
the
--
it
seems
to
me
the
right
way
to
think
about
this
question
is
whether
it
is
capable
of
being
understood
as
an
exercise
of
the
tax.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
justice
scalia,
what
the
--
two
things
about
that,
first,
as
it
seems
to
me,
what
matters
is
what
power
congress
was
exercising.
and
they
were
--
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
--
that
the
--
the
--
they
were
exercising
the
tax
power
as
well
as--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--if
the
president
said--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--the
president
said
it
wasn't
a
tax
increase
because
it
ought
to
be
understood
as
an
incentive
to
get
people
to
have
insurance.
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
infer
from
that
anything
about
whether
that
is
an
exercise
of
the
tax
power
or
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
--
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
also
true
of
the
marijuana
tax
that
was
withheld
in
sanchez.
that's
commonly
true
of
penalties
under
the
code.
they
do
--
if
they
raise
revenue,
they
are
exercises
of
the
taxing
power,
but
their
purpose
is
not
to
raise
revenue.
their
purpose
is
to
discourage
behavior.
i
mean,
the
--
the
mortgage
deduction
works
that
way.
when
the
mortgage
deduction
is
--
it's
clearly
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
when
it's
successful
it
raises
less
revenue
for
the
federal
government.
it's
still
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
so,
i
don't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
don't
think
that
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
the
actions
of
congress
here,
justice
kagan.
on
the
--
december
23rd,
a
point
of
constitutional
order
was
called
to,
in
fact,
with
respect
to
this
law.
the
floor
sponsor,
senator
baucus,
defended
it
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
in
his
response
to
the
point
of
order,
the
senate
voted
60
to39
on
that
proposition.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
members
of
congress
explaining
that
this
law
is
constitutional
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
it
was
attacked
as
a
tax
by
its
opponents.
so
i
don't
think
this
is
a
situation
where
you
can
say
that
congress
was
avoiding
any
mention
of
the
tax
power.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
congress
explicitly
disavowed
an
exercise
of
the
tax
power.
but
given
that
it
hasn't
done
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
--
not
only
is
it
fair
to
read
this
as
an
exercise
of
the
tax
power,
but
this
court
has
got
an
obligation
to
construe
it
as
an
exercise
of
the
tax
power,
if
it
can
be
upheld
on
that
basis.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--they
might
have
thought,
your
honor,
that
calling
it
a
penalty
as
they
did
would
make
it
more
effective
in
accomplishing
its
objective.
but
it
is
--
in
the
internal
revenue
code
it
is
collected
by
the
irs
on
april
15th.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
situation
in
which
you
can
say--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
i
--
you
know,
i
don't
--
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
of
that
--
that
illuminates
that,
but
certainly--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no.
there
are
certain
limiting
principles
under
the--
--
taxing
power,
and
they
--
and
i
think,
of
course,
the
constitution
imposes
some,
got
to
be
uniform,
can't
be
taxed
on
exports,
if
it's
a
direct
tax,
it's
got
to
be
apportioned.
beyond
that,
the
limiting
principle,
as
the
court
has
identified
from
drexel
furniture
to
kurth
ranch,
is
that
it
can't
be
punishment,
punitive
in
the
guise
of
a
tax.
and
there
are
three
factors
of
court
has
identified
to
look
at
that.
the
first
is
the
sanction
and
how
disproportionate
it
is
to
the
conduct;
the
second
is
whether
there
is
scienter;
and
the
third
is
whether
there
is
an
--
an
--
an
administrative
apparatus
out
there
to
enforce
the
tax.
now
in
--
in
bailey
v.
drexel
furniture,
for
example,
the
tax
was
10
percent
of
the
company's
profits,
even
if
they
had
only
one
child
laborer
for
one
day.
there
was
a
scienter
requirement,
and
it
was
enforced
by
the
department
of
labor.
it
wasn't
just
collected
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
here
you
don't
have
any
of
those
things.
this
--
the
--
the
penalty
is
calculated
to
be
no
more
than,
at
most,
the
equivalent
of
what
one
would
have
paid
for
insurance
if
you
forgone.
there
is
no
scienter
requirement,
there
is
no
enforcement
apparatus
out
there.
so,
certain--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
think
it
could,
for
the
reasons
i
--
i
discussed
yesterday.
i
don't
think
it
can
or
should
be
read
that
way.
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that,
your
honor,
if
there
is
--
if
--
if
it
is
the
view
of
the
court
that
it
can't
be,
then
i
think
the
--
the
right
way
to
handle
this
case
is
by
analogy
to
new
york
v.
united
states,
in
which
the
--
the
court
read
the
shall
provision,
shall
handle
the
level
of
radioactive
waste
as
setting
the
predicate,
and
then
the
other
provisions
were
merely
incentives
to
get
the
predicate
met,
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it
--
it
used
its
powers
together
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
market
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--providing
for
the
--
it's
justifiable
under
its
tax
power.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
congress
confronted
a
grave
problem
when
it
enacted
the
affordable
care
act.
the
40
million
americans
who
can't
get
health
insurance
and
suffered
often
very
terrible
consequences.
now,
we
agree,
i
think
--
everyone
arguing
this
case
agrees
that
congress
could
remedy
that
problem
by
imposing
the
insurance
requirement
at
the
point
of
sale.
that
won't
work.
the
reason
it
won't
work
is
because
people
will
still
show
up
at
the
hospital
or
at
their
physician's
office
seeking
care
without
insurance,
causing
the
cost
shifting
problem.
and
mr.
clement's
suggestion
that
they
can
be
signed
up
for
a
high
risk
pool
at
that
point
is
utterly
unrealistic.
think
about
how
much
it
would
cost
to
get
the
insurance
when
you
are
at
the
hospital
or
at
the
doctor.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
unfathomably
high,
that
will
never
work.
congress
understood
that.
it
chose
a
means
that
will
work.
the
means
that
it
saw
work
in
the
states
and
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
that,
and
that
it
had
every
reason
to
think
would
work
on
a
national
basis.
that
is
the
kind
of
choice
of
means
that
mcculloch
says
that
the
constitution
leaves
to
the
democratically
accountable
branches
of
government.
there
is
no
temporal
limitation
in
the
commerce
clause.
everyone
subject
to
this
regulation
is
in
or
will
be
in
the
health
care
market.
they
are
just
being
regulated
in
advance.
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
judgment
of
congress
and
the
democratically
accountable
branches
of
government.
and
i
think
this
is
actually
a
paradigm
example
of
the
kind
of
situation
that
chief
justice
marshall
envisioned
in
mcculloch
itself,
that
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
needed
to
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
that
would
allow
them
to
be
effective
in
addressing
the
great
crises
of
human
affairs
that
the
framers
could
not
even
envision.
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
under
the
commerce
clause,
then
i
urge
this
court
to
uphold
the
minimum
coverage
provision
as
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
under
new
york
v.
united
states,
this
is
precisely
a
parallel
situation.
if
the
court
thinks
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
ability
of
congress
to
impose
the
requirement
in
5000a(a),
it
can
be
treated
as
simply
the
predicate
to
which
the
tax
incentive
of
5000a(b)
seeks
accomplishment.
and
the
court
--
as
the
court
said
in
new
york,
has
a
solemn
obligation
to
respect
the
judgments
of
the
democratically
accountable
branches
of
government,
and
because
this
statute
can
be
construed
in
a
manner
that
allows
it
to
be
upheld
in
that
way,
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
this
court's
duty
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
affordable
care
act's
medicaid
expansion
provisions
will
provide
millions
of
americans
with
the
opportunity
to
have
access
to
essential
health
care
that
they
cannot
now
afford.
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
spending
clause
power
that
complies
with
all
of
the
limits
set
forth
in
this
court's
decision
in
dole,
and
the
states
do
not
contend
otherwise.
the
states
are
asking
this
court
to
do
something
unprecedented,
which
is,
to
declare
this
an
impermissibly
coercive
exercise.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes.
first,
if
i
could
just
try
to
be
a
little
more
precise
about
it,
justice
scalia.
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
steward
machine
and
in
dole
is
that
it's
possible
that
you
might
envision
a
situation
in
which
there's
coercion--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
the
courts
didn't
say
much
more.
but
i
can
think
of
something.
one
example
i
could
think
of
that
might
serve
as
a
limit
would
be
a
coyle
type
situation,
in
which
the
condition
attached
was
worth
a
fundamental
transformation
in
the
structure
of
state
government
in
a
situation
in
which
the
state
didn't
have
a
choice
but
to
accept
it.
but
--
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
or
you
may
have
a
legislature--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--no,
no.
dole
--
the
dole
conditions
are
real.
the
germaneness
condition
in
dole
is
real,
for
example,
and
so
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
think
that
would
raise
a
germaneness
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
but
i
think
--
i
think
they
are
related.
i
think
that
the
germaneness
inquiry
in
dole
really
gets
at
coercion
in
some
circumstances,
and
that's
why
i
think
they
are
related.
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
and
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
address--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--because
it
gets
to
be
harder
to
see
what--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
what
the
connection
is
between
getting
you
to
do
a
and
the
money
you
are
getting
for--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--why
--
i
think
that
--
as
i
said,
i
think
they
are
really
trying
to
get
at
the
same
thing,
and
i
--
but
i
do
think
it's
quite
different
here,
and
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
take
up
each
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
case
that
presents
that
question.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
think
the
court
has
said
in
steward
machine
and
dole
that
this
is
something
that
needs
to
be
considered
in
an
appropriate
case.
and
we
acknowledge
that.
but
i
do
think
it's
so
dependent
on
the
circumstances
that
it's
very
hard
to
say
in
the
abstract
with
respect
to
a
particular
program
that
there
is
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
--
to
say
right
here
that
i
can
--
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--congress
has
authority
to
act
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
i
do
think
--
i
really
do
think
that
it's
important
to
look
at
this,
an
issue
like
this.
if
you
are
going
to
consider
it,
it
has
got
to
be
considered
in
a
factual
context
from
which
it
arises.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--because
they
do,
the
states
do
have
a
choice
there,
especially
as
a
--
as
a
going-in
proposition.
the
argument
the
states
are
making
here
is
not
that
they're
--
that
--
this
is
not
a
going-in
proposition.
their
argument
is
that
they're
--
they
are
in
a
position
where
they
don't
have
a
choice
because
of
everything
that
has
happened
before.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
but
as
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--as
a
practical
matter,
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
alito.
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter
there
is
a
pretty
serious
political
constraint
on
that
situation
ever
arising,
because
it's
not
like
the
federal
government
is
going
to
have
an
easy
time
of
raising
the
kinds
of
tax
revenues
that
need
to
be
--
needed
to
raised
to
work
that
kind
of
fundamental
transformation,
and
that
is
real.
and
political
constraints
do
operate
to
protect
federalism
in
this
area.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
--
but
with
respect
to
a
situation
like
that
one,
justice
scalia,
the
--
the
states
have
their
education
system,
and
they
can
decide
whether
they
are
going
to
go
in
or
not.
but
here,
of
course,
i
think
it's
important
to
trace
through
the
history
of
medicaid.
it,
it
is
not
a
case,
as
my
friend
from
the
other
side
suggested,
that
the
norm
here
is
that
the
federal
government
has
offered
to
the
states
the
opportunity
either
to
stay
where
they
are
or
add
the
new
piece.
we
can
debate
that
proposition
with
respect
to
1972
one
way
or
another,
the
states
have
one
view
about
that;
we
have
a
different
one.
but
starting
in
the
1984
expansion,
with
respect
to
pregnant
women
and
infants,
it
was
an
expansion
of
the
entire
program;
states
were
given
the
choice
to
stay
in
the
entire
program
or
not.
1989
when
the
program
was
expanded
to
children
under
6
years
of
age,
under
133
percent
of
poverty,
same
thing.
1990,
kids
6
to
18
and
100
percent
of
poverty,
same
thing.
in
fact,
every
major
expansion,
same
thing.
and
so
i
just
think
the
history
of
the
program,
and
particularly
when
you
read
that
in
context
of
42
u.s.c.
1304,
which
reserves
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
amend
the
program
going
forward,
shows
you
that
this
is
something
that
the
states
have
understood
all
along.
this
has
been
the
evolution
of
it,
and
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
not
be
responsible
of
me
to
stand
here
in
advance
of
any
particular
situation
becoming
--
coming
before
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
commit
to
how
that
would
be
resolved
one
way
or
another.
but
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that's
correct,
justice
kagan.
it's
never
been
used--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it
has
never
been
used
to
cut
off
--
threaten--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--if
we
could
go
to
the
situation
we
have
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
--
with
respect
to
the
medicaid
expansion,
the
states'
argument
is,
as
they
said
in
their
briefs,
they
articulated
a
little
bit
different
this
morning
--
this
afternoon.
but
as
they
said
it
in
their
briefs,
was,
it's
not
what
you
stand
to
gain,
but
what
you
stand
to
lose.
but
i
think
an
important
thing
in
evaluating
that
argument
in
this
context
is
fully
60
percent
of
medicaid
expenditures
in
this
country
are
based
on
optional
choices;
and
i
don't
mean
by
that
the
optional
choices
of
the
states
to
stay
in
the
program
in
'84
or
'88
or
'89.
but
--
but
states
are
given
the
choices
to
expand
the
beneficiaries
beyond
the
federal
minimum
and
to
expand
services
beyond
the
federal
minimum.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
it's
much
more
nuanced
than
that,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
something
called
a
maintenance
of
effort
provision
which
lasts
until
2014,
until
such
time
as
the
medicaid
expansion
takes
place
and
the
exchanges
are
in
place.
that
applies
to
the
population.
it
says
with
respect
to
the
population,
you
can't
take
anybody
out.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
optional
benefits
where
the
states
still
have
flexibility,
they
can
still
reduce
optional
benefits
that
they
are
now
providing
if
they
--
if
they
want
to
--
to
control
costs.
they
can
also
work
on
provider
rates,
there's
also
with
respect
to
demonstration
projects
by
which
some
states
have
expanded
their
populations
beyond
the
required
eligibility
levels,
they
don't
have
to
keep
them
in.
so
--
and
then
there's
also,
if
the
state
has
a
budgetary
crisis,
it
can
get
a
waiver
of
that,
as
wisconsin
did.
so
that
is
a
--
that's
a
provision
i
think
that
does
a
significant
degree
less
than
my
friends
on
the
other
side
have
suggested
in
terms
of
--
in
terms
of
its
effect,
and
its
effect
beyond
that
is
just
temporary.
i
do
think
with
respect
to
the
--
the
first
of
their
three
arguments
for
coercion,
the
sheer
size
argument,
that
it's
very
difficult
to
see
how
that
is
going
to
work;
because
if
the
question
is
about
what
you
stand
to
lose
rather
than
what
you
stand
to
gain,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
medicaid
expansion
is
substantial
or
whether
it's
modest,
or
whether
there
is
any
expansion
at
all.
the
states,
for
example
--
the
federal
government,
for
example,
could
decide
that
under
--
under
the
current
system
too
much
money
has
ended
up
flowing
to
nursing
care
and
that
money
would
be
better
serving
the
general
welfare
if
it
were
directed
at
infants
and
children.
but
if
the
federal
government
said
we
are
going
to
redirect
the
spending
priorities
of
the
federal
money
that
we
are
offering
to
you,
the
states
could
say
well,
geez,
we
don't
like
that;
we
would
like
to
keep
spending
the
money
the
way
we
were,
and
we
have
no
choice,
because
this
has
gotten
too
big
for
us
to
exit.
and
so
--
and
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me,
standing
here
today
before
these
expansions
take
place,
under
their
theory,
the
provision
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--the
more
they
stand
to
lose.
and
--
and
so
--
and
then
it
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
think
the
situation
is
generally
as
you
have
described
it,
but
i
do
want
to
be
careful
in
saying
i
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
responsible
of
me
to
commit
now
that
the
secretary
would
exercise
the
discretion
uniformly
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--but
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it's
not
coercion,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
it's
not
coercion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but
--
but
of
course--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--it's
--
my
understanding
is
that
these
situations
are
usually
worked
out
back
and
forth
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
and
i
think
that
most--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
i'm
not.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
i
think
--
that's
what
i
think
is
the
problem
here,
justice
scalia,
is
it
seems
to
me
we
are
operating
under
a
conception
that
isn't
right.
the
reason
we
have
had
all
these
medicaid
expansions
and
the
reason
seems
to
me
why
we
are
were
where
we
are
now
and
why
60
percent
of
what's
being
spent
on
medicaid
is
based
on
voluntary
decisions
by
the
states
to
expand
beyond
what
federal
law
requires,
because
this
is
a
good
program
and
it
works.
and
the
states
generally
like
what
it
accomplishes--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
just
as
i
can't
make
a
commitment
that
the
authority
wouldn't
be
exercised,
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
commitment
that
it
would
be
exercised.
but
i
do
think
that
that
--
to
try
and
move
away
from
the
first
of
their
argument,
the
sheer
size
argument,
to
the
second
one,
which
is
that
it's
coercive
by
virtue
of
its
relationship
to
the
affordable
care
act.
i
really
think
that
that's
a
misconception
and
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
take
a
minute
and
walk
through
and
explain
why
that
is.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
correct,
justice
kagan.
that
is
no--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that's
another
way
of
trying
to
say
what
i
was
trying
to
say
to
justice
scalia
earlier
is
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
share
a
common
objective
here,
which
is
to
get
health
care
to
the
needy.
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
they
work
together
to
make
that
happen.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
but
what
i
would
say
about
that
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
we
recognize
that
these
decisions
aren't
going
to
be
easy
decisions
in
some
circumstances.
as
a
practical
matter
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
they
are
very
difficult
decisions.
but
that's
different
from
saying
that
they
are
coercive
and
that's
different
from
saying
that
it's
an
unconstitutional--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--in
of
the
situation
described
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
would
never
do
it.
but
what
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
the
medicaid
expansion
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i
think
it
would
have
to
satisfy
the
administrative
procedure,
that's
a
real
constraint.
when
i
don't
what
i
don't
feel
able
to
do
here
is
to
say
with
respect
to
this
medicaid
expansion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
so
what
i'm
trying
to
do
here
is
to
--
is
to
suggest
that
the
secretary
does
have
discretion
under
the
statute,
and
that
that
--
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
it
is
possible,
and
i'm
not
willing
to
give
that
away.
but
that
doesn't
make
this--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
kagan,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i'm
not
trying
to
be
--
i'm
not
trying
to
be
reluctant.
i
understand
how
this
works.
i'm
trying
to
be
careful
about
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
how
it
will
apply
in
the
future.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
sheer
size
idea,
there
is,
i
think,
another
couple
of
points
that
are
important
in
thinking
about
whether
that's
a
principle
courts
could
ever
apply.
once
you
get
into
that
business,
in
addition
to
the
problem
i
identified
earlier,
that
it
basically
means
that
congress
is
frozen
in
place,
based
on
the
size
of
the
program,
you
have
got
this
additional
issue
of
having
to
make
a
judgment
about
in
what
circumstances
will
--
will
the
loss
of
the
federal
funding
be
so
significant
that
you
would
count
it
as
--
coercive.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--this
is
going
to
come
from
a
withdrawal
situation.
their
argument's
about
it's
what
you
stand
to
lose
and
with
respect
to
withdrawal.
i
mean,
so,
does
it
depend
on
--
is
it
an
absolute
or
a
relative
number
with
respect
to
how
much
of
the
state
budget?
is
it
a
situation
where
you
have
to
make
a
calculation
about
how
hard
would
it
be
for
that
state
to
make
up
in
state
tax
revenues
the
federal
revenue
they
would
lose?
does
that
depend
on
whether
it's
a
high
tax
state
or
a
low
tax
state.
it
just
seems
to
me
--
and
then,
what
is
the
political
climate
in
that
state?
it
seems
to
me
like--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes,
of
course,
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
but,
here--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--you
know,
here,
the
coercion
test,
as
it's
been
discussed,
i
think,
for
example,
in
justice
o'connor's
dissent
in
dole
and
in
some
of
the
other
literature,
does
address
federalism
concerns
in
the
sense
of
the
federal
government
using
federal
funding
in
one
area
to
try
to
get
states
to
act
in
an
area
where
the
federal
government
may
not
have
article
i
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
but,
as
your
honor
suggested
earlier,
this
is
a
situation
in
which,
while
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
require
the
states,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
to
carry
out
this
program,
the
federal
government
could,
as
your
honor
suggested,
expand
medicare
and
do
it
itself.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
certainly,
but
i
think
the
problem
here
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes,
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
i
think
it
relates
to
it
in
the
opposite
way
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
would
like
it
to,
in
that
i
think
their
argument
is
that
it
would
subject
us
to
such
a
high
degree
of
political
accountability
at
the
state
level
to
withdraw
ourselves
from
the
program,
that
it's
an
unpalatable
choice
for
us,
and
that's
where
the
coercive
effect
comes
from.
and
that's
why
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--and
it
may
--
and,
of
course,
it
may
do
so,
and
it
can
make--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
think
--
i
think
congress
predicted
that
states
would
stay
in
this
program,
but
the
--
prediction
is
not
coercion.
and
the
reason
congress
predicted
it,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is
because
the
federal
government
is
paying
90-plus
percent
of
the
costs.
it
increases
state
costs--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--prediction
is
not
coercion.
i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
that's
just
an
assumption,
and
if
it
proves
to
be
wrong,
then
congress
has
time
to
recalibrate.
and
beyond
that,
i
do
think
if
--
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
the
other
part
of
your
honor's
point
--
that
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
medicaid
and
the
act,
and
particularly
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
my
--
my
friend
mr.
clement
has
suggested
that
you
can
infer
coercion
because
with
respect
to
the
population
to
which
the
provision
applies,
if
there's
no
medicaid,
there's
no
other
way
for
them
to
satisfy
the
requirement.
i
want
to
work
through
that
for
a
minute
if
i
may,
because
it's
just
incorrect.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
anybody
at
100
percent
of
the
poverty
line
or
above,
there
is
an
alternative
in
the
statute.
it's
the
exchanges
with
tax
credits
and
with
subsidies
to
insurance
companies.
so
with
respect
to
that,
the
part
of
the
population
at
100
percent
of
poverty
to
133
percent
of
poverty,
the
--
the
statute
actually
has
an
alternative
for
them.
for
people
below
100
percent
of
poverty,
it
--
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
insurance
alternative.
but
by
the
same
token,
there
is
no
penalty
that
is
going
to
be
imposed
on
anybody
in
that
group.
to
begin
with,
right
now,
the
--
the
level
of
100
percent
of
poverty
is
$10,800.
the
--
the
requirement
for
filing
a
federal
income
tax
return
is
$9,500.
so
anybody
below
$9,500,
no
penalty,
because
they
don't
have
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
the
sliver
of
people
between
$9,500
and
$10,800,
the
question
there
is
are
they
going
to
be
able
to
find
health
insurance
that
will
cost
them
less
than
8
percent
of
their
income.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
yes,
that's
true.
but
this--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--this
is
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
--
these
are
federal
dollars
that
congress
has
offered
to
the
states
and
said,
we're
going
to
make
this
offer
to
you,
but
here's
how
these
dollars
need
to
be
spent.
this
is
the
essence
of
congress's
article
i
authority
under
the
general
welfare
clause
and
the
appropriations
clause.
this
is
not
some
remote
contingency,
or
an
effort
to
leverage
in
that
regard.
this
is
how
congress
is
going
to
have
the
federal
government's
money
be
used
if
states
choose
to
accept
it.
yes,
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
predict
in
this
circumstance
that
the
states
were
going
to
--
to
take
this
money,
because
--
because
it
is
an
extremely
generous
offer
of
funds:
90-plus
percent
of
the
funding.
states
can
--
can
expand
their
medicaid
coverage
to
more
than
20
percent
of
their
population
for
an
increase
of
only
1
percent--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
of
their
funding.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
the
--
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
a
judgment
for
congress
to
make
about
how
the
federal
--
how
federal
funds
are
going
to
be
used
if
states
choose
to
accept
them,
and
congress
has
made
that
judgment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--lucky
me.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
no,
i
guess
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
would
go
back,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--i
would
go
back
to
the
fact
that
60
percent
of
the
medicaid
spending
is
now
optional.
it's
--
it's
a
result
of
choices
that
states
have
made
that
--
it's
expanded
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
no
--
to
a
more
--
much
more
modest
extent
was
my
point,
justice
kennedy.
for
example,
optional
services
where
a
huge
amount
of
money
is
spent
--
more
than
$100
billion
annually
--
the
largest
component
of
that
is
nursing
home
services.
that
remains
optional.
it's
--
right
now,
once
the
minimum
--
once
the
maintenance
provision
remains
in
place,
states
have
the
flexibility
to
that
--
reduce
those
numbers.
states
have
considerable
flexibility
now
and
going
forward
with
respect
to
the
way
that
money
is
spent.
and
i
do
think
in
terms
of
evaluating
whether
this
expansion
should
be
considered
coercive
has
got
to
be
evaluated
against
the
backdrop
of
the
fact
that
the
states
are
generally
taking
--
are
generally
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunities
of
this
statute
to
greatly
expand
the
amount
of
money
that
the
federal
government
spends
and
the
amount
of
money
that
they
spend
to
try
to
make
the
--
the
lives
of
their
citizens
better.
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
but
--
i
would
take
issue
with
that,
justice
kennedy.
part
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
that
it
--
it
provides
for
new
streamlined
eligibility
processes
to
get
people
into
the
system
at
a
--
at
a
much
faster
and
cheaper
rate.
there
are
going
to
be
costs
to
set
that
up.
but
under
the
statute,
the
federal
government
is
going
to
pay
90
percent
of
those
costs,
the
short-term
set-up
costs.
and
then
all
of
the
projections
that
we
have
seen
suggest
that
the
medium
--
to
long-term
costs
once
these
changes
are
in
place
are
going
to
be
dramatically
lower
on
the
administrative
side.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i
think
--
then
the
states
would
have
a
choice
at
that
--
at
that
point
whether
they
were
going
to
stay
in
the
program
or
not.
but
that
isn't
what
we
have
here,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
an
easy
choice,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--right.
that
would
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--right.
that
that
would
be
the
option.
they
can
leave
medicaid
if
they
decide
that
that
isn't
working
for
them.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
an
easy
choice.
i'm
also
not
saying
it
would
happen,
because
the
secretary
does
have
this
discretion--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that
would
be
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
this
medicaid
expansion
occurred
or
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
well,
like
i
said,
i
--
i
agree
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
choice
in
some
circumstances.
but
that
is
not
to
say
it's
coercion
as
a
legal
matter
or
even
as
a
practical
matter.
and
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
circumstances
were
on
how
--
and
i
think
trying
to
think
about
how
a
court
would
ever
answer
the
question
of
whether
it
was
coercive,
it
was
too
difficult
as
a
practical
matter
for
states
to
withdraw.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--yes,
justice
sotomayor,
and
this
argument
was
raised
in
dole,
and
the
court
rejected
it
as
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--well,
the
citizens
of
the
state,
but
that's
the
citizen
of
the
state
acting--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--in
the
capacity
of
the
citizens
of
the
state.
and
i
think
that's
why
i
get
--
try
to
get
back
to
the
point,
that's
why
i
think
this
is
wrong
to
think
about
this
as
coercion,
because
this
is
a
program
that
works
effectively
for
the
citizens
of
the
state,
and
states'
governments
--
and
states
governments
think
that
and
that's
why
it
has
expanded
the
way
it
has
expanded,
because
it's
providing
an
essential
service
for
millions
of
needy
citizens
in
these
states.
it's
providing
access
to
health
care
that
they
would
not
otherwise
have.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
or
lose
a
percentage
of
your
highway
funds.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
seven
percent,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
it's
--
i
think
i
agree
with
your
honor,
that
it's
--
that
it's
different,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
coercion
as
--
as
a
legal
matter.
as
i
said,
i
think
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
--
if
the
states
--
is
it
--
i'm
saying
it
won't
be
an
easy
choice,
but
the
states
made
the
choice,
they
have
made
the
choice.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
is
--
that's
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
--that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
that
answer
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli
jr
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
if
i
may
just
say
in
conclusion
that
--
i
would
like
to
take
half
a
step
back
here,
that
this
provision,
the
medicaid
expansion
that
we
are
talking
about
this
afternoon,
and
the
provisions
we
have
talked
about
yesterday,
we
have
been
talking
about
them
in
terms
of
their
effect
as
measures
that
solve
problems,
problems
in
the
economic
marketplace,
that
have
resulted
in
millions
of
people
not
having
health
care
because
they
can't
afford
insurance.
there
is
an
important
connection,
a
profound
connection
between
that
problem
and
liberty.
and
i
do
think
it's
important
that
we
not
lose
sight
of
that.
that
in
this
population
of
medicaid
eligible
people
who
will
receive
health
care
that
they
cannot
now
afford
under
this
medicaid
expansion,
there
will
be
millions
of
people
with
chronic
conditions
like
diabetes
and
heart
disease,
and
as
a
result
of
the
health
care
that
they
will
get,
they
will
be
unshackled
from
the
disabilities
that
those
diseases
put
on
them
and
have
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
liberty.
and
the
same
thing
will
be
true
for
--
for
a
husband
whose
wife
is
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
and
who
won't
face
the
prospect
of
being
forced
into
bankruptcy
to
try
to
get
care
for
his
wife
and
face
the
risk
of
having
to
raise
his
children
alone
and
i
can
multiply
example
after
example
after
example.
in
a
very
fundamental
way
this
medicaid
expansion,
as
well
as
the
provisions
we
discussed
yesterday,
secure
of
the
blessings
of
liberty.
and
i
think
that
that
is
important
as
the
court's
considering
these
issues
that
that
be
kept
in
mind.
the
--
the
congress
struggled
with
the
issue
of
how
to
deal
with
this
profound
problem
of
40
million
people
without
health
care
for
many
years,
and
it
made
a
judgment,
and
its
judgment
is
one
that
is,
i
think,
in
conformity
with
lots
of
experts
thought,
was
the
best
complex
of
options
to
handle
this
problem.
maybe
they
were
right,
maybe
they
weren't,
but
this
is
something
about
which
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
deliberate
and
they
can
vote,
and
if
they
think
it
needs
to
be
changed,
they
can
change
it.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
with
profound
respect
for
the
court's
obligation
to
ensure
that
the
federal
government
remains
a
government
of
enumerated
powers,
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
any
of
its
aspects
that
calls
that
into
question.
that
this
was
a
judgment
of
policy,
that
democratically
accountable
branches
of
this
government
made
by
their
best
lights,
and
i
would
encourage
this
court
to
respect
that
judgment
and
ask
that
the
affordable
care
act,
in
its
entirety,
be
upheld.
thank
you.
