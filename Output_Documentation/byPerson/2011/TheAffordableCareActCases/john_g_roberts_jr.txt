chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
number
11-398,
department
of
health
and
human
services
v.
florida.
mr.
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
would
apply
even
if
the
rule
is
not
jurisdictional.
the
only
difference
would
be
that
the
court
could
enforce
it
or
not
enforce
it
in
particular
cases,
which
brings
me
to
the
davis
case,
which
i
think
is
your
biggest
hurdle.
it's
a
case
quite
similar
to
this
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
social
security
act
was
at
issue,
and
the
government
waived
its
right
to
insist
upon
the
application
of
this
act.
of
course,
if
it's
jurisdictional,
you
can't
waive
it.
so
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
the
davis
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
--
you
can't
separate
those
two
points.
the
idea
that
congress
has
acquiesced
in
what
we
have
said
only
helps
you
if
what
we
have
said
is
fairly
consistent.
and
you,
yourself,
point
out
in
your
brief
that
we've
kind
of
gone
back
and
forth
on
whether
this
is
a
jurisdictional
provision
or
not.
so,
even
if
congress
acquiesced
in
it,
i'm
not
sure
what
they
acquiesced
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
long.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
--
it
was
the
calculation
of
the
interests
of
the
united
states
that
your
predecessor
made
in
the
davis
case.
there,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
exercised
the
authority
that
we
sanctioned
to
waive
the
--
the
anti-injunction
act.
and
of
course,
that
couldn't
be
done
if
it
were
jurisdictional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
it
makes
it
easy
for
the
government
to
drop
the
other
shoe
in
the
future,
right?
you
have
been
under
the
law
subject
to
this
mandate
all
along.
you
have
been
exempt
from
the
penalty,
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
take
away
the
penalty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
with
mr.
long,
and,
in
fact,
you
just
agreed
with
justice
breyer
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
provision
is
to
raise
revenue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
katsas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
whole
point
--
the
whole
point
of
the
suit
is
to
prevent
the
collection
of
penalties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
prevent
of
the
collection
of
taxes.
but
the
idea
that
the
mandate
is
something
separate
from
whether
you
want
to
call
it
a
penalty
or
tax
just
doesn't
seem
to
make
much
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
command.
a
mandate
is
a
command.
if
there
is
nothing
behind
the
command.
it's
sort
of
well
what
happens
if
you
don't
file
the
mandate?
and
the
answer
is
nothing.
it
seems
very
artificial
to
separate
the
punishment
from
the
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
you
have
a
requirement
that
is
completely
toothless?
you
know,
buy
insurance
or
else.
or
else
what?
or
else
nothing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katsas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
long,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
long,
you
were
invited
by
this
court
to
defend
the
proposition
that
the
anti-injunction
act
barred
this
litigation.
you
have
ably
carried
out
that
responsibility,
for
which
the
court
is
grateful.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
continue
argument
in
this
case
tomorrow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
continue
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-398,
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
v.
florida.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
same,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
true
say
for
the
market
in
emergency
services:
police,
fire,
ambulance,
roadside
assistance,
whatever.
you
don't
know
when
you're
going
to
need
it;
you're
not
sure
that
you
will.
but
the
same
is
true
for
health
care.
you
don't
know
if
you're
going
to
need
a
heart
transplant
or
if
you
ever
will.
so
there
is
a
market
there.
to
--
in
some
extent,
we
all
participate
in
it.
so
can
the
government
require
you
to
buy
a
cell
phone
because
that
would
facilitate
responding
when
you
need
emergency
services?
you
can
just
dial
911
no
matter
where
you
are?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
same
as
in
my
hypothetical.
you
don't
know
when
you're
going
to
need
police
assistance.
you
can't
predict
the
extent
to
emergency
response
that
you'll
need.
but
when
you
do,
and
the
government
provides
it.
i
thought
that
was
an
important
part
of
your
argument,
that
when
you
need
health
care,
the
government
will
make
sure
you
get
it.
well,
when
you
need
police
assistance
or
fire
assistance
or
ambulance
assistance,
the
government
is
going
to
make
sure
to
the
best
extent
it
can
that
you
get
it
--
get
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
--
that
it
seems
to
me,
it's
a
--
it's
a
passage
in
your
reply
brief
that
i
didn't
quite
grasp.
it's
the
same
point.
you
say
health
insurance
is
not
purchased
for
its
own
sake,
like
a
car
or
broccoli;
it
is
a
means
of
financing
health
care
consumption
and
covering
universal
risks.
well,
a
car
or
broccoli
aren't
purchased
for
their
own
sake,
either.
they
are
purchased
for
the
sake
of
transportation
or
in
broccoli,
covering
the
need
for
food.
i
--
i
don't
understand
that
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
that's
a
significant
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
means
of
satisfying
a
basic
human
need,
just
as
your
insurance
is
a
means
of
satisfying--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
principle
that
we
are
advocating
here
under
the
commerce
clause
does
not
take
the
step
of
justifying
the
creation
of
commerce.
it's
a
regulation
of
the
existing
commerce.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
key
in
lochner
is
that
we
were
talking
about
regulation
of
the
states,
right,
and
the
states
are
not
limited
to
enumerated
powers.
the
federal
government
is.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
entirely
different
question
when
you
ask
yourself
whether
or
not
there
are
going
to
be
limits
in
the
federal
power,
as
opposed
to
limits
on
the
states,
which
was
the
issue
in
lochner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
critical
how
you
define
the
market.
if
i
understand
the
law,
the
policies
that
you're
requiring
people
to
purchase
involve
--
must
contain
provision
for
maternity
and
newborn
care,
pediatric
services,
and
substance
use
treatment.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
say
that
everybody
is
going
to
need
substance
use
treatment,
substance
use
treatment
or
pediatric
services,
and
yet
that
is
part
of
what
you
require
them
to
purchase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
theory
is
that
there
is
a
market
in
which
everyone
participates
because
everybody
might
need
a
certain
range
of
health
care
services,
and
yet
you're
requiring
people
who
are
not
--
never
going
to
need
pediatric
or
maternity
services
to
participate
in
that
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're
posing
the
question
i
was
posing,
which
is
that
doesn't
apply
to
a
lot
of
what
you're
requiring
people
to
purchase:
pediatric
services,
maternity
services.
you
cannot
say
that
everybody
is
going
to
participate
in
the
substance
use
treatment
market
and
yet
you
require
people
to
purchase
insurance
coverage
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
argument
limited
to
insurance
or
means
of
paying
for
health
care?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
why
is
that?
congress
could
--
once
you
--
once
you
establish
that
you
have
a
market
for
health
care,
i
would
suppose
congress's
power
under
the
commerce
clause
meant
they
had
a
broad
scope
in
terms
of
how
they
regulate
that
market.
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
going
back
to
lochner
if
we
were
put
in
the
position
of
saying
no,
you
can
use
your
commerce
power
to
regulate
insurance,
but
you
can't
use
your
commerce
power
to
regulate
this
market
in
other
ways.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
significant
intrusion
by
the
court
into
congress's
power.
so
i
don't
see
how
we
can
accept
your
--
it's
good
for
you
in
this
case
to
say
oh,
it's
just
insurance.
but
once
we
say
that
there
is
a
market
and
congress
can
require
people
to
participate
in
it,
as
some
would
say
--
or
as
you
would
say,
that
people
are
already
participating
in
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can't
say
there
are
limitations
on
what
congress
can
do
under
its
commerce
power,
just
like
in
any
other
area,
all
--
given
significant
deference
that
we
accord
to
congress
in
this
area,
all
bets
are
off,
and
you
could
regulate
that
market
in
any
rational
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
worried
--
that's
the
area
that
congress
has
chosen
to
regulate.
there's
this
health
care
market.
everybody's
in
it.
so
we
can
regulate
it,
and
we're
going
to
look
at
a
particular
serious
problem,
which
is
how
people
pay
for
it.
but
next
year,
they
can
decide
everybody's
in
this
market,
we're
going
to
look
at
a
different
problem
now,
and
this
is
how
we're
going
to
regulate
it.
and
we
can
compel
people
to
do
things
--
purchase
insurance,
in
this
case.
something
else
in
the
next
case,
because
you've
--
we've
accepted
the
argument
that
this
is
a
market
in
which
everybody
participates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
that's
--
that's
exactly
right,
but
it
doesn't
seem
responsive
to
my
concern
that
there's
no
reason
--
once
we
say
this
is
within
congress's
commerce
power,
there's
no
reason
other
than
our
own
arbitrary
judgment
to
say
all
they
can
regulate
is
the
method
of
payment.
they
can
regulate
other
things
that
affect
this
now-conceded
interstate
market
in
health
care
in
which
everybody
participates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
no,
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--unless
i'm
missing
something,
i
think
you're
just
repeating
the
idea
that
this
is
the
regulation
of
the
method
of
payment.
and
i
understand
that
argument.
and
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
a
good
one.
but
what
i'm
concerned
about
is,
once
we
accept
the
principle
that
everybody
is
in
this
market,
i
don't
see
why
congress's
power
is
limited
to
regulating
the
method
of
payment
and
doesn't
include
as
it
does
in
any
other
area.
what
other
area
have
we
said
congress
can
regulate
this
market
but
only
with
respect
to
prices,
but
only
with
respect
to
means
of
travel?
no.
once
you're
--
once
you're
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
can
regulate
it,
pretty
much
all
bets
are
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
didn't
congress
call
it
a
tax,
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
telling
me
they
thought
of
it
as
a
tax,
they
defended
it
on
the
tax
power.
why
didn't
they
say
it
was
a
tax?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
reason.
they
thought
it
might
be
more
effective
if
they
called
it
a
penalty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
we'll
take
a
pause
for
a
minute
or
so,
mr.
clement.
why
don't
we
get
started
again.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
clement,
the
key
to
the
government's
argument
to
the
contrary
is
that
everybody
is
in
this
market.
it's
all
right
to
regulate
wickard
--
again,
in
wickard
against
filburn,
because
that's
a
particular
market
in
which
the
farmer
had
been
participating.
everybody
is
in
this
market,
so
that
makes
it
very
different
than
the
market
for
cars
or
the
other
hypotheticals
that
you
came
up
with,
and
all
they're
regulating
is
how
you
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
now
maybe
return
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
carvin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
surely--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
surely
regulation
includes
the
power
to
promote.
since
the
new
deal
we've
said
that
regulation
in
--
there
is
a
market
agricultural
products;
congress
has
the
power
to
subsidize,
to
limit
production,
all
sorts
of
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
you're
addressing
their
main
point,
which
is
that
they
are
not
creating
commerce
in
--
in
health
care.
it's
already
there,
and
we
are
all
going
to
need
some
kind
of
health
care;
most
of
us
will
at
some
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yet
we
don't
know
who
they
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
that's
not
--
i
don't
think
that's
fair,
because
not
everybody
is
going
to
enter
the
mortgage
market.
the
government's
position
is
that
almost
everybody
is
going
to
enter
the
health
care
market.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
carvin.
remaining.
general
verrilli,
you
have
four
minutes--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
counsel,
we'll
see
you
tomorrow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
continue
argument
this
morning
in
case
number
11-393,
national
federation
of
independent
business
v.
sebelius
and
case
11-400,
florida
v.
the
department
of
hhs.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
passed
parts
of
the
hollow
shell.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
this
is
reauthorization
of
appropriations
that
have
been
reauthorized
for
the
previous
5
or
10
years
and
it
was
just
more
convenient
for
congress
to
throw
it
in
in
the
middle
of
the
2700
pages
than
to
do
it
separately.
i
mean,
can
you
really
suggest
--
i
mean,
they've
cited
the
black
lung
benefits
act
and
those
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
things
we
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--finish
your
certain
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
--
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
--
the
reality
of
the
passage
--
i
mean,
this
was
a
piece
of
legislation
which,
there
was
--
had
to
be
a
concerted
effort
to
gather
enough
votes
so
that
it
could
be
passed.
and
i
suspect
with
a
lot
of
these
miscellaneous
provisions
that
justice
breyer
was
talking
about,
that
was
the
price
of
the
vote.
put
in
the
indian
health
care
provision
and
i
will
vote
for
the
other
2700
pages.
put
in
the
black
lung
provision,
and
i'll
go
along
with
it.
that's
why
all
--
many
of
these
provisions
i
think
were
put
in,
not
because
they
were
unobjectionable.
so
presumably
what
congress
would
have
done
is
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
put
together,
cobble
together,
the
votes
to
get
it
through.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
your
proposal
actually
work?
your
idea
is
that,
well,
they
can
take
care
of
it
themselves
later.
i
mean,
do
you
contemplate
them
bringing
litigation
and
saying
--
i
guess
the
insurers
would
be
the
most
obvious
ones
--
without
--
without
the
mandate,
the
whole
thing
falls
apart
and
we're
going
to
bear
a
greater
cost,
and
so
the
rest
of
the
law
should
be
struck
down.
and
that's
a
whole
other
line
of
litigation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
cause
of
action
is
it?
i've
never
heard
of
a
severability
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
go,
mr.
kneedler,
i'd
like
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
think
you
were
interrupted
before
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--justice
kennedy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
is
that
--
what's
exactly
right?
it's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation;
that
means
you
have
to
go
through
every
line
of
the
statute.
i
haven't
heard
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
yet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
that?
where
is
this
line?
i
looked
through
the
whole
act,
i
didn't
read
--
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
is
the
sharp
line?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
that
--
that
makes
your
case
that
the
one
provision
should
fall
if
the
other
does.
it
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
all
the
other
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
what
if
there
isn't
medicaid
expansion?
we've
talked
about
the
individual
mandate,
but
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
what
should
happen
if
the
medicaid
expansion
is
struck
down?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
your
--
the
government's
position
is
that
if
medicaid
expansion
is
struck
down,
the
rest
of
the
act
can
operate--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--all
of
that
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
mandate
was
--
was
constitutional.
and
if
--
that
certainly
doesn't
stop
us
from
reaching
our
own
determination
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
but
the
problem
is,
straight
from
the
title
we
have
two
complimentary
purposes,
patient
protection
and
affordable
care.
and
you
can't
look
at
something
and
say
this
promotes
affordable
care,
therefore,
it's
consistent
with
congress's
intent.
because
congress
had
a
balanced
intent.
you
can't
look
at
another
provision
and
say
this
promotes
patient
protection
without
asking
if
it's
affordable.
so,
it
seems
to
me
what
is
going
to
promote
congress's
purpose,
that's
just
an
inquiry
that
you
can't
carry
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
farr?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
--
you're
referring
to
the
government's
second
position.
their
--
their
first,
of
course,
is
that
we
shouldn't
address
this
issue
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
asked
mr.
kneedler
about
what
procedure
or
process
would
be
anticipated
for
people
who
are
affected
by
the
change
in
--
in
the
law,
and
change
in
the
economic
consequences.
do
you
have
a
view
on
how
that
could
be
played
out?
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
we
accept
your
position,
something
--
there
have
to
--
there
has
to
be
a
broad
range
of
consequences,
whether
it's
additional
legislation,
additional
litigation.
any
thoughts
on
how
that's
going
to
play
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the
challenge
is
what
we're
questioning
today,
whether
--
if
you're
an
insurance
company
and
you
don't
believe
that
you
can
give
the
coverage
in
the
way
congress
mandated
it
without
the
individual
mandate,
what
--
what
type
of
action
do
you
bring
in
a
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
mr.
clement,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
farr,
you
were
invited
by
this
court
to
brief
and
argue
in
these
cases
in
support
of
the
decision
below
on
severability.
you
have
ably
carried
out
responsibility
for
which
we
are
grateful.
case
number
11-393
is
submitted.
we
will
continue
argument
in
case
number
11-400
this
afternoon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
continue
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
11-400
florida
v.
department
of
health
and
human
services.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
my
colleagues
have
exhausted
their
questions,
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
doesn't
always
check
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
leave
the
wife
out
of
this--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
enough
frivolity
for
a
while.
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
where
the
meaningfulness
of
the
choice
is
taken
away,
is
it
the
amount
that's
being
offered,
that
it's
just
so
much
money,
of
course
you
can't
turn
it
down,
or
is
it
the
amount
that's
going
to
be
taken
away
if
you
don't
take
what
they're
offering?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
that
a
consequence
of
how
willing
they
have
been
since
the
new
deal
to
take
the
federal
government's
money?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
compromised
their
status
as
independent
sovereigns
because
they
are
so
dependent
on
what
the
federal
government
has
done,
they
should
not
be
surprised
that
the
federal
government
having
attached
the
--
they
tied
the
strings,
they
shouldn't
be
surprised
if
the
federal
government
isn't
going
to
start
pulling
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
none
of
those
have
addressed
the
coercion
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
federal
government
to
say
--
same
program:
states,
you
can
take
this
or
you
can
leave
it.
but
if
you
don't
take
it,
you
lose
every
last
dollar
of
federal
funding
for
every
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there's
no
coercion
question
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
we
don't
have
that
here.
how
does
germaneness
get
--
get
to
coercive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
germane
if
there's
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
it
fails
because
it
is
not
germane.
but
you
are
saying
it
would
not
fail
because
it
was
coercive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
--
i
know
it's
different
here.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
if
you
accept
the
fact
or
regarded
as
true
that
there
is
a
coercion
limit,
or
that
once
the
federal
government
--
once
you
are
taking
federal
government
money,
the
federal
government
money
--
can
take
it
back,
and
that
doesn't
affect
the
voluntariness
of
your
choice.
because
it
does
seem
like
a
serious
problem.
we
are
assuming
under
the
spending
clause
the
federal
government
cannot
do
this.
under
the
constitution
it
cannot
do
this.
but
if
it
gets
the
state
to
agree
to
it,
well,
then
it
can.
and
the
concern
is,
if
you
can
say:
if
you
don't
agree
with
this,
you
lose
all
your
money,
whether
that's
really
saying
the
limitation
in
the
constitution
is
--
is
largely
meaningless.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
know.
i
know
this.
i
don't
know
if
i
will
grant
it
to
you
or
not.
but
let's
assume
it's
not
this
case.
do
you
recognize
any
limitation
on
that
concern?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
give
me
some
assurance?
we
heard
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
secretary
would
use
this
authority
to
the
extent
available.
is
there
circumstances
where
you
are
willing
to
say
that
that
would
not
be
permissible?
i'm
thinking
of
the
arizona
letter,
for
example.
i
mean,
if
i
had
the
authority
and
i
was
in
that
position,
i
would
use
it
all
the
time.
you
might
--
you
want
some
little
change
made?
well,
guess
what;
i
can
take
away
all
your
money
if
you
don't
make
it.
i
win.
every
time.
it
seems
that
that
would
be
the
case.
so
why
shouldn't
we
be
concerned
about
the
extent
of
authority
that
the
government
is
exercising,
simply
because
they
could
do
something
less?
we
have
to
analyze
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
that
power
will
be
exercised,
don't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
appreciate
that.
i
appreciate
that,
but
i
guess
--
general
verrilli:
that
discretion
is
there
in
the
statute,
and
i
have
every
reason
to
think
it
is
real,
but
i
do
think,
getting
back
to
the
circumstances
here--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
the
arizona
letter
we
just
heard
about
today?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
been
used
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
course
no
states
would
say
okay,
go
ahead
but
--
make
my
day,
take
it
away;
they
are
--
they
are
going
to
give
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
just
saying
that
when,
you
know,
the
analogy
that
has
been
used,
the
gun
to
your
head,
"your
money
or
your
life",
you
say
well,
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
ever
been
shot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
because
you
have
to
give
up
your
wallet.
you
don't
have
a
choice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
cannot
represent
--
you
cannot
represent
that
the
secretary
has
never
said,
"and
if
you
don't
do
it,
we
are
going
to
take
away
all
the
funds.
"
they
cite
the
arizona
example;
i
suspect
there
are
others,
because
that
is
the
leverage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wait
a
second.
it's
not
--
it's
not
coercion
--
well,
i
guess
that's
what
the
case
is.
it's
not
coercion.
32460063247256
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
say
i'm
going
to
take
away
all
your
funds,
no
matter
how
minor
the
infringement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
what
the
--
general
verrilli:
i'm
sorry--
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
question
is
not
obviously
the
states
are
interested
in
the
same
objective
and
they
have
a
disagreement
or
they
have
budget
realities
that
they
have
to
deal
with.
and
states
say,
well,
we
are
going
to
cut
by
10
percent
what
we
reimburse
this
for
or
that
for
and
the
federal
government
says
well,
you
can't.
and
no
one
is
suggesting
that
people
want
to
cut
health
care
but
they
have
different
views
about
how
to
implement
policy
in
this
area.
and
the
concern
is
that
the
secretary
has
the
total
and
complete
say
because
the
secretary
has
the
authority
under
this
provision
to
say
you
lose
everything.
no
one's
suggested
in
the
normal
course
that
will
happen,
but
so
long
as
the
federal
government
has
that
power,
it
seems
to
be
a
significant
intrusion
on
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
state.
now
i'm
not
--
it
may
be
something
they
gave
up
many
decades
ago
when
they
decided
to
live
off
of
federal
funds.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
deny
that
it's
a
significant
authority
that
we
are
giving
the
federal
government
to
say
that
you
can
take
away
everything
if
the
states
don't
buy
into
the
next
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
such
a
good
deal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
do
you
care?
if
it's
such
a
good
deal,
why
do
you
need
the
club?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
good
deal,
take
it.
we're
not
going
to
--
if
you
don't
take
it,
you're
just
hurting
yourself.
we're
not
going
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
congress's
judgment
to
make,
and
it's
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
coercive.
you
have
another
15
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what--
--obviously,
the
federal
government
isn't
bound
to
that.
and
what
if,
after
the
90
percent,
they
say
well,
now
--
from
now
on,
we're
going
to
pay
70
percent?
what
happens
then?
where
does
that
extra
money
come
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
no
--
they
can
just
bail
out
--
whenever
the
government
reduces
the
amount
of
the
percentage
that
it's
going
to
pay,
the
states
can
say,
that's
--
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
secretary
has
the
discretion.
we're
talking
about
something
else.
we're
talking
about
fiscal
realities,
and
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
is
going
to
say
we
need
to
lower
our
contribution
to
medicaid
and
leave
it
up
to
the
states
because
we
want
the
people
to
be
mad
at
the
states
when
they
have
to
have
all
these
budget
cuts
to
keep
it
up,
and
not
at
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
you've
been
emphasizing
that
the
federal
government
is
going
to
pay
90
percent
of
this,
90
percent
of
this,
and
it's
--
it's
not
something
they
can
take
to
the
bank,
because
the
next
day
or
the
next
fiscal
year,
they
can
decide
we're
going
to
pay
a
lot
less.
and
you,
states,
are
still
on
the
hook,
because
you
--
you
don't
--
you
say
it's
not
an
easy
choice.
we
can
say
--
ask
whether
it's
coercion.
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
bail
out
of
medicaid.
you
just
have
to
pay
more
because
we're
going
to
pay
less.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mentioned
the
--
the
dole
case.
now,
what
was
the
--
the
threat
in
that
case,
raise
your
drinking
age
to
21
--
21
or
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
remember
the
percentage?

number
11-393,
national
federation
of
independent
business
versus
sebelius,
and
the
related
cases.
in
these
cases
we
consider
claims
that
congress
lacked
constitutional
power
to
enact
two
provisions
of
the
patient
protection
and
affordable
care
act
of
2010.
the
limits
on
government
power
foremost
in
many
american's
minds
are
likely
to
be
affirmative
restrictions
such
as
contained
in
the
bill
of
rights.
these
are
affirmative
restrictions
come
into
play
however
only
where
the
government
possesses
authority
to
act
in
the
first
place.
and
in
our
federal
system,
the
national
government
possess
only
those
limited
powers
the
constitution
assigns
to
it.
if
no
constitutional
power
authorizes
congress
to
pass
a
certain
law,
that
law
may
not
be
enacted
even
if
it
would
not
violate
any
of
the
express
prohibitions
in
the
bill
of
rights
or
elsewhere
in
the
constitution.
the
first
provision
in
issue
here
is
often
referred
to
as
the
individual
mandate.
that
provision
requires
individuals
to
maintain
a
specified
level
of
health
insurance.
for
many,
the
mandate
must
be
satisfied
by
purchasing
health
insurance
from
a
private
company.
those
who
do
not
obtain
the
required
coverage
over
the
irs
what
the
act
calls,
a
shared
responsibility
of
payment.
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
enact
the
individual
mandate.
the
government
advances
two
arguments
that
it
does.
first,
the
government
contends
that
the
constitution's
commerce
clause
authorizes
the
mandate.
second,
the
government
says
that
congress
could
enact
the
statute
under
its
constitutional
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes.
turning
first
to
the
commerce
clause.
congress
has
never
before
attempted
to
use
the
commerce
power
to
order
individuals
not
engaged
in
commerce
to
buy
an
unwanted
product.
and
nothing
in
the
text
to
the
constitution
suggests
it
can.
the
commerce
clause
allows
congress
to
regulate
commerce.
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
presupposes
the
existence
of
commercial
activity
to
be
regulated.
our
president
reflects
that
understanding.
as
expansive
as
our
cases
construing
the
commerce
power
have
been,
they
all
have
one
thing
in
common.
they
uniformly
described
the
power
as
reaching
activity.
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
avoid
the
word
when
quoting
our
cases.
the
individual
mandate
by
contrast
does
not
regulate
existing
activity.
it
instead
compels
individuals
to
become
active
in
commerce
by
purchasing
a
product
they
do
not
want.
the
government
contends
that
congress
can
do
this
because
the
failure
to
purchase
health
insurance
has
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
in
particular,
the
government
focuses
on
the
costs
that
the
uninsured
as
a
group
impose
on
the
healthcare
system
when
they
need
care
but
are
unable
to
pay
for
it.
allowing
congress
to
regulate
individuals
precisely
because
they
do
not
do
something
however
would
vastly
expand
federal
power.
people
for
reasons
of
their
own
often
fail
to
do
things
that
would
be
good
for
them
or
for
society.
those
failures
joined
with
the
similar
failures
of
others
can
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
under
the
government's
logic,
that
authorizes
congress
to
compel
unwilling
citizens
to
act
as
the
government
would
have
them
act.
congress
already
enjoys
vast
power
to
regulate
much
of
what
we
do
except
in
the
government's
theory
would
allow
congress
the
same
license
to
regulate
what
we
do
not
do.
that
would
fundamentally
change
the
relationship
between
the
american
citizen
and
the
federal
government.
now,
to
an
economist
perhaps,
there
is
no
difference
between
activity
and
inactivity.
both
can
have
measurable
economic
effects
on
commerce.
but
the
distinction
between
doing
something
and
doing
nothing
would
not
have
been
lost
on
the
framers
who
were
practical
statesmen,
not
academic
theorists.
the
framers
gave
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
not
to
compel
it.
for
over
200
years,
this
court's
decisions
and
congress'
actions
have
reflected
this
understanding.
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
it
now.
but
the
government
says
that
health
insurance
is
different
because
everyone
will
eventually
need
healthcare.
according
to
the
government,
that
means
the
uninsured
even
though
doing
nothing
can
be
"regulated
in
advance."
that
assertion
is
inconsistent
with
a
limited
consumption
of
federal
power.
the
commerce
clause
is
not
a
general
license
to
regulate
an
individual
from
cradle
to
grave
simply
because
he
will
predictably
engage
in
particular
transactions.
the
government
also
contends
that
congress
could
enact
the
individual
mandate
because
the
mandate
is
important
to
other
parts
of
the
healthcare
act.
other
provisions
of
the
act
whose
validity
under
the
commerce
clause
is
not
challenged
here,
restrict
the
ability
of
health
insurance
companies
to
charge
higher
prices
to
less
healthy
individuals.
those
provisions
will
likely
cause
insurance
companies
to
raise
the
prices
they
charge
everyone.
according
to
the
government,
the
individual
mandate
is
in
the
constitution's
language,
necessary
and
proper
to
support
those
provisions
because
it
will
compel
healthy
individuals
to
subsidize
the
cost
of
insuring
those
who
are
less
healthy.
our
cases
interpreting
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
have
been
very
differential
to
congress'
determination
of
what
is
necessary.
but
we
have
also
explained
that
the
clause
is
not
a
grant
of
a
great
and
independent
power.
the
clause
only
allows
congress
to
do
things
that
are
incidental
to
the
exercise
of
its
other
powers.
compelling
people
to
enter
commerce
precisely
because
they
have
chosen
not
to
cannot
be
considered
a
necessary
and
proper
supplement
to
the
commerce
clause.
there
are
separate
writings
on
this
subject
but
the
majority
of
this
court
agrees
that
the
commerce
clause
cannot
sustain
the
individual
mandate.
that
brings
us
to
the
government's
second
argument
that
the
mandate
maybe
upheld
under
congress'
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes.
the
government's
tax
power
argument
asks
us
to
interpret
the
statute
not
as
ordering
individuals
to
buy
insurance
but
rather
as
imposing
the
tax
on
those
who
go
without
it.
under
the
mandate,
if
an
individual
does
not
buy
health
insurance,
the
only
consequence
is
that
he
must
make
an
additional
payment
to
the
irs
when
he
pays
his
taxes.
the
government
says,
that
means
the
mandate
can
be
interpreted
as
establishing
a
condition
not
only
health
insurance
that
triggers
a
tax,
the
required
payment
to
the
irs.
under
that
theory,
the
mandate
makes
going
without
insurance
just
another
thing
the
government
taxes
like
buying
gasoline
or
earning
income.
and
if
the
mandate
is
just
a
tax
hike
on
taxpayers
who
don't
have
health
insurance,
it
may
be
within
congress'
constitutional
power
to
tax.
under
our
precedent,
if
there
are
two
possible
interpretations
of
a
statute
and
one
of
those
interpretations
violates
the
constitutions
--
the
constitution,
courts
should
adopt
the
interpretation
that
allows
the
statute
to
be
upheld.
thus,
the
question
here
isn't
whether
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
government
offers
to
support
its
tax
argument
is
the
best
interpretation.
rather,
under
our
cases,
the
question
is
whether
that
interpretation
is
reasonable
or
fairly
possible.
if
it
is,
then
the
court
should
adopt
that
interpretation
rather
than
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
payment
the
act
imposes
on
those
without
health
insurance
certainly
looks
like
a
tax.
by
its
terms,
it
applies
to
taxpayers
and
is
paid
to
the
irs
when
they
file
their
tax
returns.
it
doesn't
apply
to
individuals
who
don't
pay
federal
income
taxes
because
their
income
is
too
low.
for
taxpayers
who
do
know
the
payment,
its
amount
is
determined
by
factors
such
as
taxable
income,
number
of
dependents,
and
joint
filing
status.
and
the
payment
is
expected
to
generate
nearly
$4
billion
per
year
in
government
revenue.
the
act
doesn't
call
this
payment
a
tax.
it
calls
it
a
shared
responsibility
payment
and
a
penalty.
but
whether
law
is
with
congress'
taxing
power
is
determined
by
what
the
statute
does,
not
the
labels
congress
attaches
to
it.
this
payment
functions
like
a
tax.
it's
paid
by
taxpayers
with
their
to
the
irs
will
generate
a
lot
of
government
revenue.
the
amount
of
the
payment
also
suggest
it
is
in
effect
a
tax.
our
cases
examining
whether
something
is
a
tax
often
consider
this
factor.
if
an
exaction
is
high
that
no
one
could
be
expected
voluntarily
to
pay
it,
that
can
show
the
law
is
really
just
a
command
enforced
by
a
fine.
the
payment
in
this
case
by
contrast
is
calibrated
to
the
taxpayer's
income,
can
never
be
higher
than
the
cost
of
buying
insurance
and
can
often
be
quite
a
bit
less.
it
is
indeed
likely
that
many
americans
will
choose
to
pay
the
irs
rather
than
buying
insurance
and
someone
who
makes
that
payment
has
fully
complied
with
the
law.
he
has
not
done
anything
unlawful.
the
solicitor
general
confirm
that
understanding
in
his
briefs
and
at
oral
argument.
that
is
another
reason
that
the
statute
functions
more
like
a
tax
than
the
sort
of
punitive
exactions
we've
struck
down
before.
the
plaintiffs
however
say
that
because
this
statute
uses
words
like
shall
and
penalty,
the
law
must
be
read
to
make
it
illegal
not
to
buy
insurance
even
if
that
would
mean
the
law
was
unconstitutional.
we
disagree.
an
example
may
help
show
why.
suppose
congress
enacted
a
statute
providing
that
every
taxpayer
who
owns
a
house
without
energy
efficient
windows
must
pay
$50
to
the
irs.
the
amount
due
is
adjusted
based
on
factors
such
as
taxable
income
and
joint
filing
status
and
is
paid
along
with
the
taxpayer's
income
tax
return.
those
whose
income
is
below
the
filing
threshold
need
not
pay.
the
required
payment
in
the
hypothetical
statute
is
not
called
a
tax,
a
penalty
or
anything
else.
now,
no
one
would
doubt
that
this
law
impose
a
tax
and
was
within
congress'
power
to
tax.
now,
suppose
congress
used
the
word
penalty
to
describe
the
payment.
the
law
would
still
do
the
exact
same
thing.
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
it
would
then
be
outside
congress'
power
to
tax.
the
plaintiffs
also
argue
that
even
if
the
tax
is
interpreted
even
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
as
a
tax,
such
a
tax
would
violate
the
constitution's
direct
tax
clause.
but
as
our
opinion
explains
more
fully,
our
precedent
is
clear
that
a
tax
on
going
without
health
insurance
is
not
a
direct
tax.
still,
this
tax
is
a
burden
that
the
federal
government
imposes
for
an
omission,
not
an
act.
if
the
commerce
power
does
not
authorize
congress
to
regulate
those
who
don't
engage
in
commerce,
perhaps
the
taxing
power
should
not
permit
congress
to
impose
a
tax
for
not
doing
something.
but
we
cannot
accept
that
reasoning.
first
and
most
importantly,
nothing
in
the
constitution
guarantees
that
individuals
may
avoid
taxation
through
inactivity.
the
government's
commerce
clause
argument
asked
this
court
to
condone
a
new
sort
of
federal
power
ordering
people
not
in
commerce
to
buy
an
unwanted
product.
the
government's
tax
power
argument
by
contrast
asks
us
only
to
determine
that
congress
has
gone
something
it
clearly
can
do
and
indeed
often
has,
use
tax
incentives
to
encourage
people
to
buy
a
product.
upholding
the
statute
under
the
taxing
power
does
not
recognize
any
new
federal
power.
it
determines
that
congress
has
used
an
existing
one.
moreover,
congress'
ability
to
use
its
taxing
power
to
control
conduct
is
significantly
weaker
than
it
is
under
the
commerce.
when
congress
regulates
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
can
bring
the
full
weight
of
the
federal
government
to
bear
a
command
issued
under
the
commerce
clause
can
be
backed
by
fines,
imprisonment,
and
all
the
consequences
of
being
branded
a
criminal
such
as
loss
of
job
opportunities,
the
right
to
bear
arms
or
vote
in
elections.
by
contrast,
congress'
authority
under
the
taxing
power
is
limited
to
requiring
an
individual
to
pay
money
into
the
federal
treasury.
that
is
of
course
no
small
thing.
but
our
cases
have
always
maintained
that
a
tax
so
punitive
that
it
functions
like
a
command
exceeds
congress'
taxing
power.
the
affordable
care
acts
requirement
that
certain
taxpayers
pay
the
government
for
not
obtaining
health
insurance
is
in
effect
the
tax
on
those
without
insurance.
passing
on
the
wisdom
or
fairness
of
such
attacks
is
not
our
role
because
the
constitution
permits
it,
we
must
uphold
it.
in
some,
a
majority
the
court
holds
that
the
federal
government
cannot
use
the
taxing
power
to
order
people
to
buy
health
insurance
but
a
majority
also
holds
that
the
statute
here
maybe
upheld
as
a
tax
increase
on
those
without
health
insurance
which
is
within
congress'
power
to
tax.
so
this
portion
of
the
affordable
care
act
is
upheld.
we
now
turn
to
the
second
part
of
the
act
challenge
in
this
case
often
referred
to
as
the
medicaid
expansion.
enacted
in
1965,
medicaid
offers
federal
funding
to
states
to
assist
needy
persons
in
obtaining
medical
care.
in
order
to
receive
that
funding,
states
must
comply
with
federal
rules
governing
matters
such
as
who
receives
care
and
what
services
are
provided
at
what
cost.
the
affordable
care
act
dramatically
increases
state
obligations
under
medicaid.
the
current
medicaid
program
require
states
to
cover
only
discreet
categories
of
particularly
vulnerable
individuals,
pregnant
women,
children,
need
families,
the
blind
and
the
disable.
there
is
no
mandatory
coverage
for
most
childless
adults
and
parents
receive
aid
only
if
their
income
is
far
below
the
federal
poverty
line.
the
medicaid
expansion
in
contrast
requires
states
to
cover
all
individuals
under
the
age
of
65
within
incomes
below
133%
of
the
federal
poverty
line.
and,
critically
for
this
case,
if
a
state
does
not
comply
with
the
act's
new
coverage
requirements,
it
may
lose
not
only
the
federal
funding
for
the
expansion
but
all
of
it's
federal
medicaid
funds.
the
constitution
spending
clause
grants
congress
the
power
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
general
welfare
of
the
united
states.
our
cases
have
recognized
limits
on
congress'
power
to
use
the
spending
clause
to
compel
the
states
to
advance
federal
objectives.
one
of
the
fundamental
tenets
of
our
constitutional
is
that
the
states
are
independent
sovereigns,
not
merely
departments
of
the
federal
government.
our
cases
thus
make
clear
that
congress
cannot
commandeer
state
governments
to
carry
out
federal
programs.
that
is
true
whether
congress
directly
commands
a
state
to
run
a
federal
program
or
indirectly
coerces
a
state
to
adopt
the
federal
program
as
its
own.
normally,
the
way
for
states
to
avoid
complying
with
conditions
on
federal
funds
they
do
not
like
is
to
refuse
to
take
the
money.
the
states
are
separate
and
independent
sovereigns.
sometimes
they
have
to
act
like
it.
the
medicaid
expansion
however
is
far
from
a
typical
case.
congress
did
not
merely
conditioned
the
new
funds
for
implicating
--
implementing
the
expansion
on
whether
states
agreed
to
expand
their
medicaid
programs.
instead,
congress
threatened
to
withhold
states
existing
medicaid
funds
if
they
do
not
comply
with
the
expansion.
the
states
claim
that
this
threat
serves
no
purpose
other
than
to
force
unwilling
states
to
sign
up
for
the
new
program.
we
agree.
there
is
no
valid
reason
to
condition
a
state's
existing
medicaid
funds
which
are
already
being
spent
according
to
federal
conditions
on
agreeing
to
the
new
program.
we
examined
a
similar
situation
in
a
case
called
south
dakota
versus
dole.
there,
we
did
not
strike
down
the
federal
law
but
only
because
the
amount
of
money
at
stake
was
so
small,
less
than
one
half
of
1%
of
south
dakota's
total
budget.
under
those
circumstances,
we
held
that
the
threat
to
withdraw
funds
was,
"relatively
mild
encouragement
so
that
whether
to
accept
the
federal
funds
in
conditions
remains
the
prerogative
of
the
states
not
merely
in
theory
but
in
fact."
in
this
case,
the
threat
to
withhold
funds
is
more
than
relatively
mild
encouragement.
it
is
a
gun
to
the
head.
a
state
that
opts
out
of
the
medicaid
expansion
stands
to
lose
all
of
its
existing
medicaid
funding.
the
threatened
loss
of
over
10%
of
a
state's
overall
budget
leaves
a
state
with
no
real
option
but
to
accept
the
medicaid
expansion.
the
government
however
claims
that
the
medicaid
expansion
is
just
a
modification
of
the
existing
program.
it
observes
that
the
original
law
contains
a
clause
expressly
reserving
the
right
to
alter,
amend,
or
repeal
any
provision
of
the
medicaid
program.
but
the
medicaid
expansion
is
a
shift
in
kind
not
merely
degree.
under
the
affordable
care
act,
medicaid
is
transformed
into
a
program
to
meet
the
healthcare
needs
of
the
entire
non-elderly
population
with
income
below
133%
of
the
poverty
level.
it
is
no
longer
a
program
to
care
for
the
neediest
among
us
but
rather
an
element
of
a
comprehensive
national
plan
to
provide
universal
health
insurance
coverage.
a
state
could
hardly
anticipate
that
congress'
right
to
alter
or
amend
that
the
medicaid
program
included
the
power
to
transform
it
so
dramatically.
we
thus
reject
the
government's
argument
that
the
states
agreed
to
this
when
they
signed
up
for
the
original
medicaid
program.
threatening
to
withdraw
states'
existing
medicaid
funds
if
the
states
do
not
accept
the
expansion
is
an
impermissible
attempt
to
conscript
states
into
the
federal
bureaucratic
army.
although
there
are
separate
writings
on
this
issue
as
well,
seven
members
of
the
court
agree
that
the
medicaid
expansion
violates
the
constitution's
limits
on
the
spending
power.
nothing
in
the
controlling
opinion
precludes
congress
from
offering
federal
funds
to
states
to
expand
their
medicaid
programs.
what
congress
cannot
do
is
penalized
states
that
declined
to
participate
in
that
need
program
by
taking
away
their
existing
medicaid
funding.
the
medicaid
ruling
does
not
affect
other
provisions
of
the
affordable
care
act.
states
now
have
a
real
choice
whether
to
accept
the
medicaid
expansion
that
may
affect
the
implementation
of
the
act
going
forward.
but,
for
reasons
we
explained
in
our
opinion,
it
does
not
impair
the
act's
other
provisions
in
such
a
way
that
we
must
invalidate
them
in
whole
or
in
part.
the
court
today
rules
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
the
individual
mandate.
the
court
goes
on
to
rule
that
congress
does
have
such
power
under
the
taxing
clause.
finally,
the
court
rules
that
the
expansion
of
medicaid
in
the
affordable
care
act
is
unconstitutional
to
the
extent,
it
allows
the
federal
government
to
take
away
a
state's
medicaid
funds
if
the
state
does
not
adopt
the
expansion.
our
decision
today
is
based
on
our
responsibility
recognized
in
marbury
versus
madison
to
say
what
the
law
is.
it
is
not
in
any
way
based
on
our
judgment
about
whether
the
affordable
care
act
is
good
policy.
that
judgment
is
for
the
people
acting
through
their
representatives.
it
is
not
our
job
to
save
the
people
from
the
consequences
of
their
political
choices.
