justice
elena
kagan
well,
even
since
williams
packing,
there
was
south
carolina
v.
regan.
and
that
case
can
also
be
understood
as
a
kind
of
equitable
exception
to
the
rule,
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
thinking
that
the
rule
is
jurisdictional.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
long,
aren't
there
places
in
this
act
--
fees
and
penalties
--
that
were
specifically
put
under
the
anti-injunction
act?
there
is
one
on
health
care
plans,
there
is
one
on
pharmaceutical
manufacturers,
where
congress
specifically
said
the
anti-injunction
act
is
triggered
for
those.
it
does
not
say
that
here.
wouldn't
that
suggest
that
congress
meant
for
a
different
result
to
obtain?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
but
it
--
it
in
section
9008
and
in
section
9010--
justice
elena
kagan
--it
specifically
referred
to
the
part
of
the
code
where
the
anti-injunction
act
is.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
long,
aren't
you
trying
to
rewrite
the
statute
in
a
way?
the
statute
has
two
sections.
one
is
the
you
have
to
have
insurance
section
and
the
other
is
the
sanction.
the
statute
has
two
different
sets
of
exceptions
corresponding
to
those
two
different
sections.
you
are
trying
to
suggest
that
the
statute
says:
well,
it's
your
choice;
either
buy
insurance
or
pay
a
--
or
pay
a
fee.
but
that's
not
the
way
the
statute
reads.
and
congress,
it
must
be
supposed,
you
know,
made
a
decision
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
way
the
statute
reads,
that
it
should
instead
be
a
regulatory
command
and
a
penalty
attached
to
that
command.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
can
i
ask
you
about
reed
elsevier?
justice
ginsburg
suggested
that
the
language
was
very
similar
in
reed
elsevier
as
it
is
here,
but
there
are
even
further
similarities.
reed
elsevier
pointed
out
that
the
provision
in
question
wasn't
in
title
28.
here,
too,
it's
not
in
title
28.
in
reed
elsevier,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
provision
there
had
numerous
exceptions
to
it.
here,
too,
there
are
numerous
exceptions
that
we
find
that
have
been
created
by
the
courts
over
the
years.
in
reed
elsevier,
the
question
was
essentially
one
about
timing.
come
to
court
after
you
file
your
registration.
here,
too,
the
question
is
one
about
timing.
come
to
court
after
you
make
--
after
you
pay
your
taxes.
so
reed
elsevier
seems
in
multiple
respects
on
all
fours
with
this
case.
why
is
that
wrong?
justice
elena
kagan
i
take
the
point--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
if
you
would
comment
on
the
similarities
of
reed
elsevier
to
this
case.
how
do
you
think
it's
different,
if
at
all?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
nature
of
the
representation
you
made,
that
the
only
consequence
is
the
penalty,
suppose
a
person
does
not
purchase
insurance,
a
person
who
is
obligated
to
do
so
under
the
statute
doesn't
do
it,
pays
the
penalty
instead,
and
that
person
finds
herself
in
a
position
where
she
is
asked
the
question,
have
you
ever
violated
any
federal
law,
would
that
person
have
violated
a
federal
law?
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
because.
justice
elena
kagan
but
as
long
as
they've
paid
the
penalty.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
katsas,
is
your
basic
position
when
we
are
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
a
statute
has
to
say
it's
jurisdictional
to
be
jurisdictional?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
would
--
i
mean,
i
suppose
one
could
try
to
make
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
reed
elsevier
by
focusing
on
the
difference
between
instituting
something
and
maintaining
something,
and
suggesting
that
instituting
is
more
what
a
litigant
does,
and
maintaining,
as
opposed
to
dismissing,
is
more
of
what
judge
does.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
katsas,
do
you
think
a
person
who
is
subject
to
the
mandate
but
not
subject
to
the
penalty
would
have
standing?
justice
elena
kagan
what
would
that
look
like?
what
would
the
argument
be
as
to
what
the
injury
was?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
just
understand,
mr.
katsas,
when
the
states
say
that
they
are
injured,
are
they
talking
about
the
people
who
are
eligible
now
but
who
are
not
enrolled?
or
are
they
also
talking
about
people
who
will
become
newly
eligible?
justice
elena
kagan
but
who
are
eligible
now.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
does
seem
odd,
to
suggest
that
the
state
is
being
injured
because
people
who
could
show
up
tomorrow
with
or
without
this
law
will
--
will
show
up
in
greater
numbers.
i
mean,
presumably
the
state
wants
to
cover
people
whom
it
has
declared
eligible
for
this
benefit.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
you've
talked
on
--
a
couple
of
times
about
other
alternatives
that
congress
might
have
had,
other
alternatives
that
the
respondents
suggest
to
deal
with
this
problem,
in
particular,
the
alternative
of
mandating
insurance
at
the
point
at
which
somebody
goes
to
a
hospital
or
an
emergency
room
and
asks
for
care.
did
congress
consider
those
alternatives?
why
did
it
reject
them?
how
should
we
think
about
the
question
of
alternative
ways
of
dealing
with
these
problems?
justice
elena
kagan
and
this
is
especially
true,
isn't
it,
general--
justice
elena
kagan
--verrilli,
because
in
this
context,
the
subsidizers
eventually
become
the
subsidized?
justice
elena
kagan
i
suppose,
though,
general,
one
question
is
whether
the
determined
efforts
of
congress
not
to
refer
to
this
as
a
tax
make
a
difference.
i
mean,
you're
suggesting
we
should
just
look
to
the
practical
operation.
we
shouldn't
look
at
labels.
and
that
seems
right,
except
that
here
we
have
a
case
in
which
congress
determinedly
said
this
is
not
a
tax,
and
the
question
is
why
should
that
be
irrelevant?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
clement,
now
it
seems
as
though
you're
just
talking
about
a
matter
of
timing;
that
congress
can
regulate
the
transaction,
and
the
question
is
when
does
it
make
best
sense
to
regulate
that
transaction?
and
congress
surely
has
within
its
authority
to
decide,
rather
than
at
the
point
of
sale,
given
an
insurance-based
mechanism,
it
makes
sense
to
regulate
it
earlier.
it's
just
a
matter
of
timing.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
doesn't
that
seem
a
little
bit,
mr.
clement,
cutting
the
bologna
thin?
i
mean,
health
insurance
exists
only
for
the
purpose
of
financing
health
care.
the
two
are
inextricably
interlinked.
we
don't
get
insurance
so
that
we
can
stare
at
our
insurance
certificate.
we
get
it
so
that
we
can
go
and
access
health
care.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
clement,
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
but,
of
course,
the
theory
behind,
not
just
the
government's
case,
but
the
theory
behind
this
law
is
that
people
are
in
this
market
right
now,
and
they
are
in
this
market
because
people
do
get
sick,
and
because
when
people
get
sick,
we
provide
them
with
care
without
making
them
pay.
and
it
that
would
be
different,
you
know,
if
you
were
up
here
saying,
i
represent
a
class
of
christian
scientists.
then
you
might
be
able
to
say,
look,
you
know,
why
are
they
bothering
me.
but
absent
that,
you're
in
this
market.
you're
an
economic
actor.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
we
are
talking
about
the
health
insurance
market,
which
is
designed
to
access
the
health
care
market.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
once
again
though,
who's
in
commerce
and
what
are
they
in
commerce?
if
the
effect
of
all
these
uninsured
people
is
to
raise
everybody's
premiums,
not
just
when
they
get
sick,
if
they
get
sick,
but
right
now
in
the
aggregate,
and
wickard
and
raich
tell
us
we
should
look
at
the
aggregate,
and
the
aggregate
of
all
these
uninsured
people
are
increasing
the
normal
family
premium,
congress
says,
by
a
thousand
dollars
a
year.
those
people
are
in
commerce.
they
are
making
decisions
that
are
affecting
the
price
that
everybody
pays
for
this
service.
justice
elena
kagan
not
necessarily,
mr.
clement.
and
it's
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
health
care
service,
that
you
are
entitled
to
health
care
when
you
go
to
an
emergency
room,
when
you
go
to
a
doctor,
even
if
you
can't
pay
for
it.
so
the
difference
between
your
hypotheticals
and
the
real
case
is
the
problem
of
uncompensated
care
which--
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
carvin--
justice
elena
kagan
--please.
justice
elena
kagan
i've
forgotten
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
see
what
it
means
to
be
the
junior
justice?
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
that's
why
i
suggested,
mr.
carvin,
that
it
might
be
different
if
you
were
raising
an
as-applied
challenge
and
presenting
a
class
of
people
whom
you
could
say
clearly
would
not
be
in
the
health
care
market.
but
you're
raising
a
facial
challenge
and
we
can't
really
know
which,
which
of
the
many,
many,
people
that
this
law
addresses
in
fact
will
not
participate
in
the
health
care
market
and
in
fact
will
not
impose
costs
on
all
the
rest
of
us.
so
the
question
is
can
congress
respond
to
those
facts,
that
we
have
no
crystal
ball,
that
we
can't
tell
who
is
and
isn't
going
to
be
in
the
health
insurance
market,
and
say
most
of
these
people
will
be
and
most
of
these
people
will
thereby
impose
costs
on
the
rest
of
us
and
that's
a
problem
that
we
can
deal
with
on
a
class-wide
basis?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
carvin,
a
large
part
of
this
argument
has
concerned
the
question
of
whether
certain
kinds
of
people
are
active
participants
in
a
market
or
not
active
participants
in
a
market.
in
your
test,
which
is
a
test
that
focuses
on
this
activity/inactivity
distinction,
would
force
one
to
confront
that
problem
all
the
time.
now,
if
you
look
over
the
history
of
the
commerce
clause,
what
you
see
is
that
there
were
sort
of
unhappy
periods
when
the
court
used
tests
like
this
--
direct
versus
indirect,
commerce
versus
manufacturing.
i
think
most
people
would
say
that
those
things
didn't
really
work.
and
the
question
is,
why
should
this
test,
inactive
versus
active,
work
any
better?
justice
elena
kagan
so
mr.
clement,
let's
start
with
the
text.
then
you
suggest,
and
i
think
that
there
is
--
this
is
right,
that
there
is
a
textual
basis
for
saying
that
the
guaranteed-issue
and
the
community
ratings
provisions
are
tied
to
the
mandate.
and
you
said
--
you
pointed
to
where
that
was
in
the
findings.
is
there
a
textual
basis
for
anything
else,
because
i've
been
unable
to
find
one.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
look
at
the
text,
the
sharp
dividing
line
is
between
guaranteed-issue
and
community
ratings
on
the
one
hand,
everything
else
on
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
although
the
exchanges
function
perfectly
well
in
utah
where
there
is
no
mandate.
they
function
differently,
but
they
function.
and
the
question
is
always,
does
congress
want
half
a
loaf.
is
half
a
loaf
better
than
no
loaf?
and
on
something
like
the
exchanges
it
seems
to
me
a
perfect
example
where
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
loaf.
the
exchanges
will
do
something.
they
won't
do
everything
that
congress
envisioned.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
you
just
said
something
which
you
say
a
lot
in
your
brief.
you
say
the
question
is
the
manner
in
which
it
would
have
operated.
and
i
think
that
that's
not
consistent
with
our
cases.
and
i
guess
the
best
example
would
be
booker
where
we
decided
not
to
sever
provisions,
notwithstanding
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
clearly
operate
in
a
different
manner
now
than
they
did
when
congress
passed
them.
they
operate
as
advisory
rather
than
mandatory.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
not
inconsistent
with
our
practice,
right,
mr.
clement?
i
mean,
you
have
to
go
back
decades
and
decades
and
decades,
and
i'm
not
sure
even
then
you
could
find
a
piece
of
legislation
that
we
refused
to
sever
for
this
reason.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement--
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
kneedler,
that
would
be
a
revolution--
justice
elena
kagan
--in
our
severability
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
we
have
never
suggested
that
we
were
going
to
say,
look,
this
legislation
was
a
brokered
compromise
and
we
are
going
to
try
to
figure
out
exactly
what
would
have
happened
in
the
complex
parliamentary
shenanigans
that
go
on
across
the
street
and
figure
out
whether
they
would
have
made
a
difference.
instead,
we
look
at
the
text
that's
actually
given
us.
for
some
people,
we
look
only
at
the
text.
it
should
be
easy
for
justice
scalia's
clerks.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
problem,
mr.
farr,
isn't
it,
that
they're
going
to
a
pool
of
people
that
will
gradually
get
older
and
unhealthier.
that's
the
way
the
thing
works.
once
you
say
that
the
insurance
companies
have
to
cover
all
of
the
sick
people
and
all
of
the
old
people,
the
rates
climb.
more
and
more
young
people
and
healthy
people
say,
why
should
we
participate,
we
can
just
get
it
later
when
we
get
sick.
so
they
leave
the
market,
the
rates
go
up
further,
more
people
leave
the
market,
and
the
whole
system
crashes
and
burns,
becomes
unsustainable.
justice
elena
kagan
and
this
is
not--
justice
elena
kagan
--like
what
i
think.
what
do
i
know?
it's
just
what's
reflected
in
congress's
findings,
that
it's
look
--
it
looks
at
some
states
and
says,
this
system
crashed
and
burned.
it
looked
at
another
state
with
the
minimum
coverage
provision
and
said,
this
one
seems
to
work.
so
we
will
package
the
minimum
coverage
provision
with
the
nondiscrimination
provisions.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
farr,
i
understood
that
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
scalia
was
essentially
that
the
minimum
coverage
provision
was
not
the
heart
of
the
act.
instead,
the
minimum
coverage
provision
was
a
tool
to
make
the
nondiscrimination
provisions,
community
rating
guaranteed-issue,
work.
so
if
you
assume
that,
that
all
the
minimum
coverage
is
is
a
tool
to
make
those
provisions
work,
then
i
guess
i
would
refocus
justice
scalia's
question
and
say,
if
we
know
that
something
is
just
a
tool
to
make
other
provisions
work,
shouldn't
that
be
the
case
in
which
those
other
provisions
are
severed
along
with
the
tool?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
can
i
ask
you
just
a
matter
of
clarification?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
instead
of
the
federal
government
picked
up
90
percent
of
the
cost
the
federal
government
picked
up
100
percent
of
the
cost.
justice
elena
kagan
the
exact
same
argument.
so
that
really
reduces
to
the
question
of
why
is
a
big
gift
from
the
federal
government
a
matter
of
coercion?
in
other
words,
the
federal
government
is
here
saying,
we
are
giving
you
a
boatload
of
money.
there
are
no
--
there's
no
matching
funds
requirement,
there
are
no
extraneous
conditions
attached
to
it,
it's
just
a
boatload
of
federal
money
for
you
to
take
and
spend
on
poor
people's
healthcare.
it
doesn't
sound
coercive
to
me,
i
have
to
tell
you.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you
do
make
that
argument
in
your
brief,
just
a
stand
alone
program,
a
boatload
of
money,
no
extraneous
conditions,
no
matching
funds,
is
coercive?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical,
mr.
clement.
justice
elena
kagan
now,
suppose
i'm
an
employer
and
i
see
somebody
i
really
like
and
i
want
to
hire
that
person.
and
i
say
im
going
to
give
you
$10
million
a
year
to
come
work
for
me.
and
the
person
says
well,
i
--
you
know,
i've
never
been
offered
anywhere
approaching
$10
million
a
year,
of
course
i'm
going
to
say
yes
to
that.
now
we
would
both
be
agreed
that
that's
not
coercive,
right.
justice
elena
kagan
wow,
wow.
i'm
offering
you
$10
million
a
year
to
come
work
for
me
and
you
are
saying
this
is
anything
but
a
great
choice?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
clement
--
mr.
clement,
can
that
possibly
be.
when
a
taxpayer
pays
taxes
to
the
federal
government,
the
person
is
acting
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
when
a
taxpayer
pays
taxes
to
new
york,
a
person
is
acting
as
a
citizen
of
new
york.
and
new
york
could
no
more
tell
the
federal
government
what
to
do
with
the
federal
government's
money
than
the
federal
government
can
tell
new
york
what
to
do
with
the
moneys
that
new
york
is
collecting.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
if
you
are
right,
mr.
clement,
doesn't
that
mean
that
medicaid
is
unconstitutional
now?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
when
does
a
program
become
too
big?
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
dollar
number.
justice
elena
kagan
so
on
the
third
--
on
the
third,
suppose
you
had
the
current
program
and
congress
wakes
up
tomorrow
and
says
"we
think
that
there's
too
much
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
program,
and
we're
going
to
put
some
new
conditions
on
how
the
states
use
this
money
so
we
can
prevent
fraud
and
abuse,
and
we're
going
to
tie
it
to
everything
that's
been
there
initially.
"
unconstitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
get
the
idea.
i
mean,
congress
can
legislate
fraud
and
abuse
restrictions
in
medicaid,
and
congress
can
legislate
coverage
expansions
in
medicaid.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
that
is
very
confusing
because
the
idea
behind
cooperative
federal/state
programs
was
exactly
a
federalism
idea.
it
was
to
give
the
states
the
ability
to
administer
those
programs.
it
was
to
give
the
states
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
running
those
programs.
and
that's
exactly
what
medicaid
is.
justice
elena
kagan
cooperative
federalism
does
not
mean
that
there
are
no
federal
mandates
and
no
federal
restrictions
involved
in
a
program
that
uses
90
percent
here,
100
percent
federal
money.
it
means
there
is
flexibility
built
into
the
program
subject
to
certain
rules
that
the
federal
government
has
about
how
it
wishes
its
money
to
be
used.
it's
like
giving
a
gift
certificate.
if
i
give
you
a
gift
certificate
for
one
store,
you
can't
use
it
for
other
stores.
but
still
you
can
use
it
for
all
kinds
of
different
things.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general,
what's
the
--
been
the
history
of
its
use?
has
the
secretary
in
fact
ever
made
use
of
that
authority?
justice
elena
kagan
and,
general
verrilli--
justice
elena
kagan
--general
verrilli,
before
you
do
that,
i'm
sorry,
but
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
--
i
mean
the
money
or
your
life
has
consequence
because
we
are
worried
that
that
person
is
actually
going
to
shoot.
so
i
think
that
this
question
about
are
we
--
what
do
we
think
the
secretary
is
going
to
do
is
an
important
one.
and
as
i
understand
it,
i
mean
when
the
secretary
withdraws
funds,
what
the
secretary
is
doing
is
withdrawing
funds
from
poor
people's
health
care.
and
that
the
secretary
is
reluctant
and
loathe
to
take
money
away
from
poor
people's
health
care.
and
that
that's
why
these
things
are
always
worked
out.
it's
that
the
secretary
really
doesn't
want
to
use
this
power.
and
so
the
secretary
sits
down
with
the
state
and
figures
out
a
way
for
the
secretary
not
to
use
the
power.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
general
verrilli,
you
are
not
willing
to
give
away
whether
the
apa
would
bar
that;
but,
the
apa
surely
has
to
apply
to
a
discretionary
act
of
the
secretary.
