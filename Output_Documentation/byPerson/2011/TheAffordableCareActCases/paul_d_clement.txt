mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mandate
represents
an
unprecedented
effort
by
congress
to
compel
individuals
to
enter
commerce
in
order
to
better
regulate
commerce.
the
commerce
clause
gives
congress
the
power
to
regulate
existing
commerce.
it
does
not
give
congress
the
far
greater
power
to
compel
people
to
enter
commerce
to
create
commerce
essentially
in
the
first
place.
now,
congress
when
it
passed
the
statute
did
make
findings
about
why
it
thought
it
could
regulate
the
commerce
here,
and
it
justified
the
mandate
as
a
regulation
of
the
economic
decision
to
forego
the
purchase
of
health
insurance.
that
is
a
theory
without
any
limiting
principle.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right,
justice
sotomayor.
we
say,
consistent
with
220
years
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
that
if
you
regulate
the
point
of
sale,
you
regulate
commerce,
that's
within
congress'
commerce
power.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice,
i
think
there
is
two
points
to
make
on
that.
one
is,
a
lot
of
the
discussion
this
morning
so
far
has
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
here
is
emergency
room
visits,
and
the
only
thing
that's
being
imposed
is
catastrophic
care
coverage;
but,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
earlier,
a
lot
of
the
insurance
that's
being
covered
is
for
ordinary
preventive
care,
ordinary
office
visits,
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
one
can
predict.
so
there
is
a
big
part
of
the
market
that's
regulated
here
that
wouldn't
pose
the
problem
that
you're
suggesting;
but,
even
as
to
emergency
room
visits,
it
certainly
would
be
possible
to
regulate
at
that
point.
you
could
simply
say,
through
some
sort
of
mandate
on
the
insurance
companies,
you
have
to
provide
people
that
come
in
--
this
will
be
a
high-risk
pool,
and
maybe
you
will
have
to
share
it
amongst
yourself
or
something,
but
people
simply
have
to
sign
up
at
that
point,
and
that
would
be
regulating
at
the
point
of
sale.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
we
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
timing
alone,
and
we
think
it
has
very
substantive
effects.
because
if
congress
tried
to
regulate
at
the
point
of
sale,
the
one
group
that
it
wouldn't
capture
at
all
are
the
people
who
don't
want
to
purchase
health
insurance
and
also
have
no
plans
of
using
health
care
services
in
the
near
term.
and
congress
very
much
wanted
to
capture
those
people.
i
mean,
those
people
are
essentially
the
golden
geese
that
pay
for
the
entire
lowering
of
the
premium.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy,
but,
if
it
is,
i
think
there
is
at
least
two
problems
with
it.
one
is,
as
justice
alito's
question
suggested
earlier,
i
mean,
somebody
who
is
not
in
the
insurance
market
is
sort
of
irrelevant
as
an
actuarial
risk.
i
mean,
we
could
look
at
the
people
not
in
the
insurance
market,
and
what
we'd
find
is
that
they're
relatively
young,
relatively
healthy,
and
they
would
have
a
certain
pool
of
actuarial
risks
that
would
actually
lead
to
lower
premiums.
the
people
that
would
be
captured
by
guaranteed
rating
and
community
issue
--
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating
would
presumably
have
a
higher
risk
profile,
and
there
would
be
higher
premiums.
and
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
things
congress
sought
to
accomplish
here,
was
to
force
individuals
into
the
insurance
market
to
subsidize
those
that
are
already
in
it
to
lower
the
rates.
and
that's
just
not
my
speculation,
that's
finding
i
at
43a
of
the
government's
brief
that
--
it
has
the
statute.
and
that's
one
of
the
clear
findings.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
there
are
other
options
that
are
available.
the
most
straightforward
one
would
be
to
figure
out
what
amount
of
subsidy
to
the
insurance
industry
is
necessary
to
pay
for
guaranteed
issue
and
community
rating.
and
once
we
calculate
the
amount
of
that
subsidy,
we
could
have
a
tax
that's
spread
generally
through
everybody
to
raise
the
revenue
to
pay
for
that
subsidy.
that's
the
way
we
pay
for
most
subsidies.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
government
might
be
able
to
do
that.
i
think
it
might
raise
some
issues
about
whether
or
not
that
would
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
do
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
it
would
depend
a
little
bit
on
how
it
was
formulated;
but,
my
concern
would
be
--
the
constitutional
concern
would
be
that
it
would
just
be
a
disguised
impermissible
direct
tax.
and
i
do
think
--
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
we
get
to
the
taxing
power
to
soon,
but
i
do
think
it's
worth
realizing
that
the
taxing
power
is
limited
in
the
ability
to
impose
direct
taxes.
and
the
one
thing
i
think
the
framers
would
have
clearly
identified
as
a
direct
tax
is
a
tax
on
not
having
something.
i
mean,
the
framing
generation
was
divided
over
whether
a
tax
on
carriages
was
a
direct
tax
or
not.
hamilton
thought
that
was
a
indirect
tax;
madison
thought
it
was
a
direct
tax.
i
have
little
doubt
that
both
of
them
would
have
agreed
that
a
tax
on
not
having
a
carriage
would
have
clearly
been
a
direct
tax.
i
also
think
they
would
have
thought
it
clearly
wasn't
a
valid
regulation
of
the
market
in
carriages.
and,
you
know,
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
hilton
against
the
united
states,
that's
this
court's
first
direct
tax--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
start
at
the
beginning
of
your
question
with
mcculloch.
mcculloch
was
not
a
commerce
power
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
the
bank
was
not
justified
and
the
corporation
was
not
justified
as
an
exercise
of
commerce
power.
so
that
is
not
a
case
that
says
that
it's
okay
to
conjure
up
the
bank
as
an
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
what,
of
course,
the
court
didn't
say,
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
had
a
very
different
reaction
to,
is,
you
know,
we
are
not
just
going
to
have
the
bank,
because
that
wouldn't
be
necessary
and
proper,
we
are
going
to
force
the
citizenry
to
put
all
of
their
money
in
the
bank,
because,
if
we
do
that,
then
we
know
the
bank
of
the
united
states
will
be
secure.
i
think
the
framers
would
have
identified
the
difference
between
those
two
scenarios,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
great
chief
justice
would
have
said
that
forcing
people
to
put
their
deposits
in
the
bank
of
the
united
states
was
necessary
and
proper.
now,
if
you
look
through
all
the
cases
you
mentioned,
i
do
not
think
you
will
find
a
case
like
this.
and
i
think
it's
telling
that
you
won't.
i
mean,
the
regulation
of
the
wheat
market
in
wickard
against
filburn,
all
this
effort
to
address
the
supply
side
and
what
producers
could
do,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
support
the
price
of
wheat.
it
would
have
been
much
more
efficient
to
just
make
everybody
in
america
buy
10
loaves
of
bread.
that
would
have
had
a
much
more
direct
effect
on
the
price
of
wheat
in
the
prevailing
market.
but
we
didn't
do
that.
we
didn't
say
when
we
had
problems
in
the
automobile
industry
that
we
are
not
just
going
to
give
you
incentives,
not
just
cash
for
clunkers,
we
are
going
to
actually
have
ever
everybody
over
100,000
has
to
buy
a
new
car--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
the
first
thing
you
have
to
say
is
what
market
are
we
talking
about?
because
the
government
--
this
statute
undeniably
operates
in
the
health
insurance
market.
and
the
government
can't
say
that
everybody
is
in
that
market.
the
whole
problem
is
that
everybody
is
not
in
that
market,
and
they
want
to
make
everybody
get
into
that
market.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i
think
what
health
insurance
does
and
what
all
insurance
does
is
it
allows
you
to
diversify
risk.
and
so
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
i'm
paying
now
instead
i'm
paying
later.
that's
credit.
insurance
is
different
than
credit.
insurance
guarantees
you
an
upfront,
locked-in
payment,
and
you
won't
have
to
pay
any
more
than
that
even
if
you
incur
much
great
expenses.
and
in
every
other
market
that
i
know
of
for
insurance,
we
let
people
basically
make
the
decision
whether
they
are
relatively
risk
averse,
whether
they
are
relatively
non-risk
averse,
and
they
can
make
the
judgment
based
on--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
let
me
say
this,
which
is
to
say
--
you're
right
in
the
first
point
to
say
that
it's
the
states
that
do
it,
which
makes
it
different
right
there.
but
it's
also--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
i
think
you
might
make
a
different
argument
about
cars
than
you
would
make
about
health
insurance,
unless
you
tried
to
say
--
but,
you
know,
we're--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but,
justice
sotomayor,
what
i
think
is
different
is
there
is
lots
of
people
in
manhattan,
for
example,
that
don't
have
car
insurance
because
they
don't
have
cars.
and
so
they
have
the
option
of
withdrawing
from
that
market.
it's
not
a
direct
imposition
from
the
government.
so
even
the
car
market
is
difference
from
this
market,
where
there
is
no
way
to
get
outside
of
the
regulatory
web.
and
that's,
i
think,
one
of
the
real
problems
with
this
because,
i
mean,
we
take
as
a
given--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--at
some
point,
that's
right,
but
all
sorts
of
people
will
not,
say,
use
health
care
in
the
next
year,
which
is
the
relevant
period
for
the
insurance.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
of
course
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
course
not,
justice
breyer,
but
the
point
is
that
once
congress
decides
it's
going
to
regulate
extant
commerce,
it
is
going
to
get
all
sorts
of
latitude
to
make
the
right
judgments
about
actuarial
predictions,
which
actuarial
to
rely
on,
which
one
not
to
rely
on.
the
question
that's
a
proper
question
for
this
court,
though,
is
whether
or
not,
for
the
first
time
ever
in
our
history,
congress
also
has
the
power
to
compel
people
into
commerce,
because,
it
turns
out,
that
would
be
a
very
efficient
things
for
purposes
of
congress'
optimal
regulation
of
that
market.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
once
again,
it
depends
on
which
market
we're
talking
about.
if
we're
talking
about
the
health
care
insurance
market--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
with
respect
to
the
health
insurance
market
that's
designed
to
have
payment
in
the
health
care
market,
everybody
is
not
in
the
market.
and
that's
the
premise
of
the
statute,
and
that's
the
problem
congress
is
trying
to
solve.
and
if
it
tried
to
solve
it
through
incentives,
we
wouldn't
be
here;
but,
it's
trying
to
solve
it
in
a
way
that
nobody
has
ever
tried
to
solve
an
economic
problem
before,
which
is
saying,
you
know,
it
would
be
so
much
more
efficient
if
you
were
just
in
this
market--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
certainly
in
any
way
that
distinguishes
this
from
any
other
context.
when
i'm
sitting
in
my
house
deciding
i'm
not
to
buy
a
car,
i
am
causing
the
labor
market
in
detroit
to
go
south.
i
am
causing
maybe
somebody
to
lose
their
job,
and
for
everybody
to
have
to
pay
for
it
under
welfare.
so
the
cost
shifting
that
the
government
tries
to
uniquely
to
associate
with
this
market,
it
is
everywhere.
and
even
more
to
the
point,
the
rationale
that
they
think
ultimately
supports
this
legislation,
that
look,
it's
an
economic
decision,
once
you
make
the
economic
decision,
we
aggregate
the
decision,
there
is
a
substantial
effect
on
commerce.
that
argument
works
here.
it
works
in
every
single
industry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
breyer,
there
are
other
markets
that
affect
every
one:
transportation,
food,
burial
services,
though
we
don't
like
to
talk
about
that
either.
there
also
are
situations
where
there
are
many
economic
effects
from
somebody's
failure
to
purchase
a
product.
and
if
i
could,
if
i
could
talk
about
the
difference
between
the
health
insurance
market
and
the
health
care
market,
i
mean,
ultimately
i
don't
want
you
to
leave
here
with
the
impression
that
anything
turns
on
that.
because
if
the
government
decided
tomorrow
that
they
would
come
up
with
a
great
--
some
of
these
--
some
private
companies
come
up
with
a
great
new
wonder
drug
that
would
be
great
for
everybody
to
take,
would
have
huge
health
benefits
for
everybody;
and
by
the
way,
also
if
everybody
had
to
buy
it,
it
would
facilitate
economies
of
scale,
and
the
production
would
be
great,
and
the
price
would
be
cheaper
and
force
everybody
in
the
health
care
market,
the
actual
health
care
market
to
buy
the
wonder
drug,
i'd
be
up
here
making
the
same
argument.
i
would
be
saying
that's
not
a
power
that's
within
the
commerce
power
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
something
much
greater.
and
it
would
have
been
much
more
controversial.
that's
why
the
important
things.
in
federalist
45,
madison
says
the
commerce
power.
that's
a
new
power,
but
it's
not
one
anyone
has
any
apprehension
about.
the
reason
they
didn't
have
any
apprehension
about
it
is
because
it's
a
power
that
only
operated
once
people
were
already
in
commerce.
you
see
that
from
the
text
of
the
clause.
the
first
kind
of
commerce
congress
gets
to
regulate
is
commerce
with
foreign
nations.
did
anybody
think
the
fledgling
republic
had
the
power
to
compel
some
other
nation
into
commerce
with
us?
of
course
not.
and
in
the
same
way,
i
think
if
the
framers
had
understood
the
commerce
power
to
include
the
power
to
compel
people
to
engage
in
commerce--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kagan,
again,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
a
limiting
principle.
my
unwillingness
to
buy
an
electric
car
is
forcing
up
the
price
of
an
electric
car.
if
only
more
people
demanded
an
electric
car
there
would
be
economies
of
scale,
and
the
price
would
go
down.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kagan,
first
of
all,
i
do
think
there
--
this
is
not
the
only
place
where
there's
uncompensated
care.
if
some
--
if
i
don't
buy
a
car
and
somebody
goes
on
welfare,
i'm
going
to
end
up
paying
for
that
as
well.
but
let
me
also
say
that
there
is
a
real
disconnect
then
between
that
focus
on
what
makes
this
different
and
statute
that
congresses
passed.
if
all
we
were
concerned
about
is
the
cost
sharing
that
took
place
because
of
uncompensated
care
in
emergency
rooms,
presumably
we
have
before
us
a
statute
that
only
addressed
emergency
care
and
catastrophic
insurance
coverage.
but
it
covers
everything,
soup
to
nuts,
and
all
sorts
of
other
things.
and
that
gets
at
the
idea
that
there
is
two
kinds
of
cost
shifting
that
are
going
on
here.
one
is
the
concern
about
emergency
care
and
that
somehow
somebody
who
gets
sick
is
going
to
shift
costs
back
to
other
policy
areas
--
holders.
but
there
is
a
much
bigger
cost
shifting
going
on
here,
and
that's
the
cost
shifting
that
goes
on
when
you
force
healthy
people
into
an
insurance
market
precisely
because
they
are
healthy,
precisely
because
they
are
not
likely
to
go
to
the
emergency
room,
precisely
because
they
are
not
likely
to
use
the
insurance
they
are
forced
to
buy
in
the
health
care
insurance.
that
creates
a
huge
windfall.
it
lowers
the
price
of
premiums.
and
again,
this
is
not
just
some
lawyer
up
here
telling
you
that's
what
it
does
and
trying
to
second-guess
the
congressional
economic
decisions.
this
is
congress's
findings,
findings
i
on
page
43
a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
take
them
in
turn.
i
would
encourage
this
court
not
to
garcia-ize
the
commerce
clause
and
just
simply
say
it's
up
to
congress
to
police
the
commerce
clause.
so
i
don't
think
that
is
a
limiting
principle.
second
of
all--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
100
percent,
and
i
think
that
was
the
chief
justice's
point
which
was
once
you
open
the
door
to
compelling
people
into
commerce
based
on
the
narrow
rationales
that
exist
in
this
industry,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
stop
that
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
the
other
two
principles
are
lopez
--
and
this
case
really
is
not
--
i
mean,
you
know,
lopez
is
a
limit
on
the
affirmative
exercise
of
people
who
are
already
in
commerce.
the
question
is,
is
there
any
other
limit
to
people
who
aren't
in
commerce?
and
so
i
think
this
is
the
case
that
really
asks
that
question.
and
then
the
first
point
which
was
i
take
it
to
be
the
solicitor
general's
point
is,
with
all
due
respect,
simply
a
description
of
the
insurance
market.
it's
not
a
limiting
principle,
because
the
justification
for
why
this
is
a
valid
regulation
of
commerce
is
in
no
way
limited
to
this
market.
it
simply
says,
these
are
economic
decisions,
they
have
effect
on
other
people,
my
failure
to
purchase
in
this
market
has
a
direct
effect
on
others
who
are
already
in
the
market.
that's
true
of
virtually
every
other
market
under
the
sun.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'd
be
delighted
to,
which
is
--
i
mean,
i
--
you
are
absolutely
right.
once
you're
in
the
commerce
power,
there
is
not
--
this
court
is
not
going
to
police
that
subject
maybe
to
the
lopez
limit.
and
that's
exactly
why
i
think
it's
very
important
for
this
court
to
think
seriously
about
taking
an
unprecedented
step
of
saying
that
the
commerce
power
not
only
includes
the
power
to
regulate,
prescribe
the
rule
by
which
commerce
is
governed,
the
rule
of
gibbons
v.
ogden.
but
to
go
further
and
say
it's
not
just
prescribing
the
rule
for
commerce
that
exists
but
is
the
power
to
compel
people
to
enter
into
commerce
in
the
first
place.
i
would
like
to
say
two
very
brief
things
about
the
taxing
power,
if
i
could.
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
this
isn't
a
tax.
it
wasn't
denominated
a
tax.
it's
not
structured
as
a
tax.
if
it's
any
tax
at
all,
though,
it
is
a
direct
tax.
article
i,
section
9,
clause
4,
the
framers
would
have
had
no
doubt
that
a
tax
on
not
having
something
is
not
an
excise
tax
but
a
forbidden
direct
tax.
that's
one
more
reason
why
this
is
not
proper
legislation
because
it
violates
that.
the
second
thing
is
i
would
urge
you
to
read
the
license
tax
case
which
the
solicitor
general
says
is
his
best
case
for
why
you
ignore
the
fact
that
a
tax
is
denominated
into
something
other.
because
that
is
a
case
where
the
argument
was
that
because
the
federal
government
had
passed
a
license
not
a
tax,
that
somehow
that
allowed
people
to
take
actions
that
would
have
been
unlawful
under
state
law,
that
this
was
some
special
federal
license
to
do
something
that
was
forbidden
by
state
law.
this
court
looked
beyond
the
label
in
order
to
preserve
federalism
there.
what
the
solicitor
general
and
the
government
ask
you
to
do
here
is
exactly
the
opposite,
which
is
to
look
past
labels
in
order
to
up-end
our
basic
federalist
system.
in
this--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
represent
26
states.
i
do
think
the
states
could
pass
this
mandate,
but
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
have
to
resist
your
premise,
because
i
didn't
answer
yes,
the
states
can
do
it
because
it
would
be
a
valid
regulation
of
intrastate
commerce.
i
said
yes,
the
states
can
do
it
because
they
have
a
police
power,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
states
on
the
one
hand
and
the
limited,
enumerated
federal
government
on
the
other.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
alito,
that
is
exactly
the
government's
argument.
it's
an
extraordinarily
illogical
argument.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
individual
mandate
is
unconstitutional,
then
the
rest
of
the
act
cannot
stand.
as
congress
found
and
the
federal
government
concedes,
the
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue
provisions
of
the
act
cannot
stand
without
the
individual
mandate.
congress
found
that
the
individual
mandate
was
essential
to
their
operation.
and
not
only
can
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating
not
stand,
not
operate
in
the
manner
that
congress
intended,
they
would
actually
counteract
congress's
basic
goal
of
providing
patient
protection
but
also
affordable
care.
if
you
do
not
have
the
individual
mandate
to
force
people
into
the
market
then
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue
will
cause
the
cost
of
premiums
to
skyrocket.
we
can
debate
the
order
of
magnitude
of
that
but
we
can't
debate
that
the
direction
will
be
upward.
we
also
can't
debate--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
a
couple
of
questions
--
a
couple
of
responses,
justice
sotomayor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it's
very
relevant
here
that
congress
had
before
it
as
examples
some
of
the
states
that
had
tried
to
impose
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating
and
did
not
impose
an
individual
mandate.
and
congress
rejected
that
model.
so
your
question
is
quite
right
in
the
saying
that
it's
not
impossible
to
have
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating
without
an
individual
mandate.
but
it's
a
model
that
congress
looked
at
and
specifically
rejected.
and
then,
of
course,
there
is
congress's
own
finding,
and
their
finding,
of
course,
this
is
(i),
which
is
<43{a}of>
[=
43(a)of]
the
government's
brief
in
the
appendix,
congress
specifically
found
that
having
the
individual
mandate
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
a
couple
of
things.
one,
you
get
--
i
mean,
i
would
think
you
are
going
to
have
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
and
if
congress
--
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
congress's
goal
of
providing
patient
protection
but
also
affordable
care,
we
can't
--
i
don't
think
it
works
to
just
take
the
things
that
save
money
and
cut
out
the
things
that
are
going
to
make
premiums
more
expensive.
but
at
a
minimum--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
let
me
answer
the
bottom
line
question,
which
is,
no
matter
what
you
do
in
this
case,
at
some
point
there's
going
to
be
--
if
you
strike
down
the
mandate,
there
is
going
to
be
something
for
congress
to
do.
the
question
is
really,
what
task
do
you
want
to
give
congress.
do
you
want
to
give
congress
the
task
of
fixing
the
statute
after
something
has
been
taken
out,
especially
a
provision
at
the
heart,
or
do
you
want
to
give
congress
the
task
of
fixing
health
care?
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
in
this
situation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
of
course
that's
right,
justice
sotomayor,
and
no
matter
what
you
do
here,
congress
will
have
the
options
available.
so
if
you,
if
you
strike
down
only
the
individual
mandate,
congress
could
say
the
next
day:
well,
that's
the
last
thing
we
ever
wanted
to
do
so
we
will
strike
down
the
rest
of
the
statute
immediately
and
then
try
to
fix
the
problem.
so
whatever
you
do,
congress
is
going
to
have
options.
the
question
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say,
justice
scalia,
which
is,
i
think
the
question
for
this
court
is,
we
all
recognize
there
is
legislative
inertia.
and
then
the
question
is:
what
is
the
best
result
in
light
of
that
reality?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
agree.
we
are
simply
asking
this
court
to
take
on
straight
on
the
idea
of
the
basic
remedial
inquiry
into
severability
which
looks
to
be
intent
of
the
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
two
responses,
justice
scalia.
we
can
look
at
this
court's
cases
on
severability,
and
they
all
formulate
the
task
a
little
bit
differently.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
every
one
of
them
talks
about
congressional
intent.
but
here's,
here's
the
other
answer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
is
right.
and
here
is
how
i
would
answer
your
question,
which
is,
when
congress
includes
a
severability
clause,
it
is
addressing
the
issue
in
the
abstract.
it
doesn't
say:
no
matter
which
provisions
you
strike
down,
we
absolutely,
positively
want
what's
left.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
can
be,
which
is
the
basic
proposition,
that
it's
congressional
intent
that
governs.
now
everybody
on
this
court
has
a
slightly
different
way
of
dividing
legislative
intent.
and
i
would
suggest
the
one
common
brand
among
every
member
of
this
court
as
i
understand
it
is
you
start
with
the
text.
everybody
can
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan
i
would
be
delighted
to
take
you
through
my
view
of
the
text
and
why
there
are
other
things
that
have
to
fall.
the
first
place
i
would
ask
you
to
look
is
finding
j
which
is
on
the
same
page
43
a.
and
as
i
read
that,
that's
a
finding
that
the
individual
mandate
is
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
exchanges.
but
there
are
other
links
between
guaranteed-issue
and
community
ratings
and
the
exchanges.
and
there
i
think
it's
just
the
way
that
the
exchanges
are
supposed
to
work.
and
the
text
makes
this
clear
is
they
are
supposed
to
provide
a
market
where
people
can
compare
community
rated
insurance.
that's
what
makes
the
exchanges
function.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i
think
there
are
situations
where
half
a
loaf
is
actually
worse
and
i
want
to
address
that.
but
before
i
do
it
--
broadly.
but
before
i
do
that,
if
i
could
stick
with
just
the
exchanges.
i
do
think
the
question
that
this
court
is
supposed
to
ask
is
not
just
whether
they
can
limp
along
and
they
can
operate
independently,
but
whether
they
operate
in
the
manner
that
congress
intended.
and
that's
where
i
think
the
exchanges
really
fall
down.
because
the
vision
of
the
exchanges
was
that
if
you
got
out
of
this
current
situation
where
health
insurance
is
basically
individualized
price
based
on
individualized
underwriting
and
you
provide
community
ratings,
then
it's
going
to
be
very
easy
for
people
to
say
okay,
well
this
is
a
silver
policy
and
this
is
a
bronze
policy
and
this
is
a
gold
policy
and
we
can,
you
know,
i
can
just
pick
which
insurer
provides
what
i
think
is
going
to
be
the
best
service
based
on
those
comparable
provisions.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
but
justice
kagan,
i
mean
i
actually
think
booker
supports
our
point
as
well,
because
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
remedial
holding
of
booker.
and
the
first
part
of
it,
which
i
think
actually
very
much
supports
our
point
is
where
the
majority
rejects
the
approach
of
the
dissent,
which
actually
would
have
required
nothing
in
the
statute
to
have
been
struck,
not
a
single
word.
but
nonetheless
this
court
said,
well,
if
you
do
that
then
all
of
the
sentencing
is
basically
going
to
be
done
by
a
combination
of
the
juries
and
the
prosecutors
and
the
judges
are
going
to
be
cut
out.
and
the
court
said
the
one
thing
we
know
is
that's
not
the
manner
in
which
congress
thought
that
this
should
operate.
now
later
they
make
a
different
judgment
about
the
--
which
particular
provisions
to
cut
out.
but
i
do
think
booker
is
consistent
with
this
way
of
looking
at
it
and
certainly
consistent
with
brock,
the
opinion
we
rely
on
because
there
the
court
only
reached
that
part
of
the
opinion
after
they
already
found
that
the
must-hire
provision
operated
functionally
independent
from
the
legislative
detail,
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
two
kinds
of
responses
to
that.
one,
i
do
think
there
are
some
provisions
that
i
would
identify
as
being
at
the
periphery
of
this
statute.
and
i'll
admit
that
the
case
for
severing
those
is
perhaps
the
strongest.
but
i
do
think
it
is
fundamentally
different,
because
if
we
were
here
arguing
that
some
provision
on
the
periphery
of
the
statute,
like
the
biosimilars
act
or
some
of
the
provisions
that
you've
mentioned
was
unconstitutional,
i
think
you'd
strike
it
down
and
you
wouldn't
even
think
hard
about
severability.
what
makes
this
different
is
that
the
provisions
that
have
constitutional
difficulties
or
are
tied
at
the
hip
to
those
provisions
that
have
the
constitutional
difficulty
are
the
very
heart
of
this
act.
and
then
if
you
look
at
how
they
are
textually
interconnected
to
the
exchanges,
which
are
then
connected
to
the
tax
credits,
which
are
also
connected
to
the
employer
mandates,
which
is
also
connected
to
some
of
the
revenue
offsets,
which
is
also
connected
to
medicaid,
if
you
follow
that
through
what
you
end
up
with
at
the
end
of
that
process
is
just
sort
of
a
hollow
shell.
and
at
that
point
i
think
there
is
a
strong
argument
for
not
--
i
mean,
you
can't
possibly
think
that
congress
would
have
passed
that
hollow
shell
without
the
heart
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
tried
to
make
them
germane.
but
i'm
not
here
to
tell
you
that
--
some
of
their
--
surely
there
are
provisions
that
are
just
looking
for
the
next
legislative
vehicle
that
is
going
to
make
it
across
the
finish
line
and
somebody's
going
to
attach
it
to
anything
that
is
moving.
i
mean,
i'll
admit
that.
but
the
question
is
when
everything
else
from
the
center
of
the
act
is
interconnected
and
has
to
go,
if
you
follow
me
that
far,
then
the
question
is
would
you
keep
this
hollowed-out
shell?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
justice
kennedy,
the
reality
is
i
think
this
court's
opinions
have
at
various
times
applied
both
strains
of
the
analysis.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
--
i'm
a
big
believer
in
objective
tests,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
with
you
to
apply
a
more
textually
based
objective
approach.
i
think
there
are
certain
justices
that
are
more
inclined
to
take
more
of
a
peek
at
legislative
history,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
it
would
only
fortify
the
conclusion
that
you
would
reach
from
a
very
objective
textual
inquiry.
but
i
am
happy
to
focus
the
court
on
the
objective
textual
inquiry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
is
whether
the
statute
can
operate
in
the
manner
that
congress
--
that
congress
intended.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
sotomayor,
every
one
of
your
cases,
if
you
have
a
formulation
for
severability,
if
you
interpret
it
woodenly
it
becomes
tautological.
and
justice
blackmun
addressed
this
in
footnote
7
of
the
brock
opinion
that
we
rely
on,
where
he
says:
of
course
it's
not
just
--
you
know,
it
doesn't
operate
exactly
in
the
manner
because
it
doesn't
have
all
the
pieces,
but
you
still
make
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
when
congress
links
two
provisions
together
and
one
really
won't
work
without
the
other--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor
let
me
try
to
answer
the
specific
question
and
then
answer
the
big
picture
question.
the
specific
question
is,
i
mean,
you
could
do
that.
you
could
adopt
a
new
rule
now
that
basically
says,
look,
we've
severed--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
in
fairness,
though,
justice
sotomayor,
to
get
to
the
point
you
are
wanting
to
get
to,
you
would
have
to
ratchet
up
that
presumption
a
couple
of
ticks
on
the
scale,
because
the
one
thing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
one
thing
that's
wrong
with
that,
which
is
still
at
a
smaller
level,
is
that's
inconsistent
with
virtually
every
statement
in
every
one
of
your
severability
opinions,
which
all
talk
about
congressional
intent.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan.
i
think
there
are
more
recent
examples.
a
great
example
i
think
which
sort
of
proves,
and
maybe
is
a
segue
to
get
to
my
broader
point,
is
a
case
that
involves
a
state
statute,
not
a
federal
statute,
but
i
don't
think
anything
turns
on
that,
is
randall
against
sorrell,
where
this
court
struck
down
various
provisions
of
the
vermont
campaign
finance
law.
but
there
were
other
contribution
provisions
that
were
not
touched
by
the
theory
that
the
court
used
to
strike
down
the
contribution
limits.
but
this
court
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
said:
there
is
no
way
to
think
that
the
vermont
legislator
would
have
wanted
these
handful
of
provisions
there
on
the
contribution
side,
so
we
will
strike
down
the
whole
thing.
and
if
i
could
make
the
broader
point,
i
mean,
i
think
the
reason
it
makes
sense
in
the
democracy
with
separation
of
powers
to
in
some
cases
sever
the
whole
thing
is
because
sometimes
a
half
a
loaf
is
worse.
and
a
great
example,
if
i
dare
say
so,
is
buckley.
in
buckley
this
court
looked
at
a
statute
that
tried
to,
in
a
coherent
way,
strike
down
limits
on
contributions
and
closely
related
expenditures.
this
court
struck
down
the
ban
on
expenditures,
left
the
contribution
ban
in
place,
and
for
4
decades
congress
has
tried
to
fix
what's
left
of
the
statute,
largely
unsuccessfully,
whereas
it
would
have
i
think
worked
much
better
from
a
democratic
and
separation
of
powers
standpoint
if
the
court
would
have
said:
look,
expenditures
are
--
you
can't
limit
expenditures
under
the
constitution;
the
contribution
provision
is
joined
at
the
hip.
give
congress
a
chance
to
actually
fix
the
problem.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
what
i
would
propose
is
the
following,
justice
breyer,
is
you
follow
the
argument
this
far
and
then
you
ask
yourself
whether
what
you
have
left
is
a
hollowed-out
shell
or
whether--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
you
should
do,
is
let
me
say
the
following,
which
is
follow
me
this
far,
which
is
mandatory,
individual
mandate
is
tied,
as
the
government
suggests,
to
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating,
but
the
individual
mandate,
guaranteed-issue,
and
community
rating
together
are
the
heart
of
this
act.
they
are
what
make
the
exchanges
work.
the
exchanges
in
turn
are
critical
to
the
tax
credits,
because
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit
is
key
to
the
amount
of
the
policy
price
on
the
exchange.
the
exchanges
are
also
key
to
the
employer
mandate,
because
the
employer
mandate
becomes
imposed
on
an
employer
if
one
of
the
employees
gets
insurance
on
the
exchanges.
but
it
doesn't
stop
there.
look
at
the
medicare
provision
for
dish
hospitals,
okay?
these
are
hospitals
that
serve
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
needy.
this
isn't
in
title
i.
it's
in
the
other
part
that
you
had
in
your
other
hand.
but
it
doesn't
work
without
the
mandate,
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i
think
what
i
would
suggest,
justice
alito
--
i
don't
want
to
be
unresponsive
--
is
that
you
sort
of
follow
the
argument
through
and
figure
out
what
in
the
core
of
the
act
falls.
and
then
i
guess
my
fallback
would
be
if
what's
left
is
a
hollowed-out
shell,
you
could
just
leave
that
standing.
if
you
want
a
sort
of
practical
answer,
i
mean,
i
do
think
you
could
just
--
you
know,
you
could
use
justice
breyer's
off-the-cuff
as
a
starting
point
and
basically
say,
you
know,
title
i
and
a
handful
of
related
provisions
that
are
very
closely
related
to
that
are
--
are
really
the
heart
of
the
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
bigger
volume
--
on
the
other
hand
--
i
mean,
you
could
strike
one
and
leave
the
other,
but
at
a
certain
point
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
at
--
at
a
certain
point,
i
just
think
that,
you
know,
the
better
answer
might
be
to
say,
we've
struck
the
heart
of
this
act,
let's
just
give
congress
a
clean
slate.
if
it's
so
easy
to
have
that
other
big
volume
get
reenacted,
they
can
do
it
in
a
couple
of
days;
it
won't
be
a
big
deal.
if
it's
not,
because
it's
very
----
[laughter]
--well,
but
--
i
mean,
you
can
laugh
at
me
if
you
want,
but
the
point
is,
i'd
rather
suspect
that
it
won't
be
easy.
because
i
rather
suspect
that
if
you
actually
dug
into
that,
there'd
be
something
that
was
quite
controversial
in
there
and
it
couldn't
be
passed
quickly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
that's
our
whole
point.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
maybe
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
don't
want
to,
i
mean,
spend
all
my
time
on
--
fighting
over
the
periphery,
because
i
do
think
there
are
some
provisions
that
i
think
you
would
make
as
--
as
an
exercise
of
your
own
judgment,
the
judgment
that
once
you've
gotten
rid
of
the
core
provisions
of
this
act,
that
you
would
then
decide
to
let
the
periphery
fall
with
it.
but
if
you
want
to
keep
the
periphery,
that's
fine.
what
i
think
is
important,
though,
as
to
the
core
provisions
of
the
act,
which
aren't
just
the
mandate
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue,
but
include
the
exchanges,
the
tax
credit,
medicare
and
medicaid
--
as
to
all
of
that,
i
think
you
do
want
to
strike
it
all
down
to
avoid
a
redux
of
buckley.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
make
four
points
in
rebuttal,
but
i
will
start
with
justice
sotomayor's
question;
which
is
to
simply
say
this
isn't
just
a
tool;
it's
the
principal
tool,
congress
identified
it
as
an
essential
tool.
it's
not
just
a
tool
to
make
it
work.
it's
a
tool
to
pay
for
it,
to
make
it
affordable.
and
again,
that's
not
my
characterization;
that's
congress's
characterization
in
subfinding
i
on
page
43a
of
the
government's
brief.
now,
that
bring
me
to
my
first
point
in
rebuttal,
which
is
mr.
kneedler
says
quite
correctly,
tells
this
court,
don't
look
at
the
budgetary
implications.
the
problem
with
that,
though,
is
once
it's
common
ground,
that
the
individual
mandate
is
in
the
statute
at
least
in
part
to
make
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue
affordable,
that
really
is
all
you
have
to
identify.
that
establishes
the
essential
link
that
it's
there
to
pay
for
it.
you
don't
have
to
figure
out
exactly
how
much
that
is
and
which
box
--
i
mean,
it
clearly
is
a
substantial
part
of
it,
because
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
take
healthy
individuals
and
put
them
into
the
risk
pool,
and
this
is
quoting
their
finding,
which
is
in
order
--
they
put
people
into
the
market
"which
will
lower
premiums".
so
that's
what
their
intent
was.
so
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
--
the
final
number.
you
know
that's
what
was
going
on
here,
and
that's
reason
alone
to
sever
it.
now
the
government
--
mr.
kneedler
also
says
there
is
an
easy
dividing
line
between
what
they
want
to
keep
and
what
they
want
to
dish
out.
the
problem
with
that
is
that,
you
know,
you
read
their
brief
and
you
might
think
oh,
there
is
a
guaranteed-issue
and
a
community
rating
provision
subtitle
in
the
bill.
there
is
not.
to
figure
out
what
they
are
talking
about
you
have
to
go
to
page
6
of
their
brief,
of
their
opening
severability
brief,
where
they
tell
you
what
is
in
and
what's
out.
and
the
easy
dividing
line
they
suggest
is
actually
between
300g(a)(1)
and
300g(a)(2),
because
on
community
rating
they
don't
--
they
say
that
(a)(1)
goes,
but
then
they
say
(a)(2)
has
to
stay,
because
that's
the
way
that
you'll
have
some
sort
of,
kind
of
potemkin
community
rating
for
the
exchanges.
but
if
you
actually
look
at
those
provisions,
(a)(2)
makes
all
these
references
to
(a)(1).
it
just
doesn't
work.
now,
in
getting
back
to
the
--
an
inquiry
that
i
think
this
court
actually
can
approach,
is
to
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
you
need
look
no
further
than
look
than
the
title
of
this
statute:
patient
protection
and
affordable
care.
i
agree
with
mr.
farr
that
community
rating
and
guaranteed-issue
were
the
crown
jewels
of
this
act.
they
were
what
was
trying
to
provide
patient
protection.
and
what
made
it
affordable?
the
individual
mandate.
if
you
strike
down
guaranteed-issue,
community
rating
and
the
individual
mandate,
there
is
nothing
left
to
the
heart
of
the
act.
and
that
takes
me
to
my
last
point,
which
is
simply
this
court
in
buckley
created
a
halfway
house
and
it
took
congress
40
years
to
try
to
deal
with
the
situation,
when
contrary
to
any
time
of
their
intent,
they
had
to
try
to
figure
out
what
are
we
going
to
do
when
we
are
stuck
with
this
ban
on
contributions,
but
we
can't
get
at
expenditures
because
the
court
told
us
we
couldn't?
and
for
40
years
they
worked
in
that
halfway
house.
why
make
them
do
that
in
health
care?
the
choice
is
to
give
congress
the
task
of
fixing
this
statute,
the
residuum
of
this
statute
after
some
of
it
is
struck
down,
or
giving
them
the
task
of
simply
fixing
the
problem
on
a
clean
slate.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
close
choice.
if
the
individual
mandate
is
unconstitutional,
the
rest
of
the
act
should
fall.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutionality
of
the
act's
massive
expansion
of
medicaid
depends
on
the
answer
to
two
related
questions:
first
is
the
expansion
coercive
and
second
does
that
coercion
matter.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
kagan,
if
everything
else
in
the
statute
remained
the
same,
i
would
be
making
the
exact
same
argument.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
let
me
--
i
mean,
i
eventually
want
to
make
a
point
where
even
if
you
had
a
stand
alone
program
that
just
gave
100
percent,
again
100
percent
boatload,
nothing
but
boat
load
--
well,
there
would
still
be
a
problem.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
is.
but
before
i
make
that
point,
can
i
simply
say
you
built
into
your
question
the
idea
that
there
are
no
conditions.
and
of
course,
when
you
first
asked
it
was
what
about
the
same
program
with
100
percent
matching
on
the
newly
eligible
mandatory
individuals,
which
is
how
the
statute
refers
to
them.
and
that
would
have
a
very
big
condition.
and
the
very
big
condition
is
that
the
states
in
order
to
get
that
new
money,
they
would
have
to
agree
not
only
to
the
new
conditions
but
the
government
here
is
--
the
congress
is
leveraging
their
entire
prior
participation
in
the
program--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
guess
i
would
want
to
know
where
the
money
came
from.
and
if
the
money
came
from--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
if
i
told
you
actually
it
came
from
my
own
bank
account.
and
that's
what's
really
going
on
here
in
part.
and
that's
why
it's
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
and
if
new
york
and
the
united
states
figured
out
a
way
to
tax
individuals
at
greater
than
100
percent
of
their
income
then
maybe
you
could
just
say
it's
two
separate
sovereigns
and
two
separate
taxes.
but
we
all
know
that
in
the
real
world
that
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
continues
to
increase
taxes
that
decreases
the
ability
of
the
states
to
tax
their
own
citizenry
and
it's
a
real
tradeoff.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what's
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it's
not
simply
the
case
that
you
can
say,
well,
it's
free
money,
so
we
don't
even
have
to
ask
whether
the
program's
coercive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
really
saying
the
opposite,
which
is
not
that
every
gift
is
coercive,
no
matter
what
the
amount,
no
matter
how
small.
i'm
saying
essentially
the
opposite,
which
is
there
has
to
be
some
limit.
there
has
to
be
some
limit
on
coercion.
and
the
reason
is
quite
simple,
because
this
court's
entire
spending
power
jurisprudence
is
premised
on
the
notion
that
spending
power
is
different,
and
that
congress
can
do
things
pursuant
to
the
spending
power
that
it
can't
do
pursuant
to
its
other
enumerated
powers
precisely
because
the
programs
are
voluntary.
and
if
you
relax
that
assumption
that
the
programs
are
voluntary,
and
you
are
saying
they
are
coercion,
then
you
can't
have
the
spending
power
jurisprudence--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--maybe
i
can
talk
about
what
makes
it
coercive
by
talking
about
the
actual
statute
at
issue
here
and
focusing
on
what
i
think
are
the
three
hallmarks
of
this
statute
that
make
it
uniquely
coercive.
one
of
them
is
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
tied
to
the
decidedly
nonvoluntary
individual
mandate.
and
that
makes
this
unique,
but
it
makes
it
significant,
i
think.
i
will
continue.
i
thought
you
had
a
question.
i'm
sorry.
the
second
factor,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
congress
here
made
a
distinct
and
conscious
decision
to
tie
the
state's
willingness
to
accept
these
new
funds,
not
just
to
the
new
funds
but
to
their
entire
participation
in
the
statute,
even
though
the
coverage
for
these
newly
eligible
individuals
is
segregated
from
the
rest
of
the
program.
and
this
is
section
2001a3
at
page
23a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
distinct
in
two
different
directions.
one
is,
in
some
of
the
prior
expansions
of
the
program,
but
not
all,
congress
has
made
covering
newly
eligible
individuals
totally
voluntary.
if
the
states
wants
to
cover
the
newly
eligible
individuals,
they
will
get
additional
money;
but,
if
they
don't,
they
don't
risk
any
of
their
existing
participation
programs.
the
1972
program
was
a
paradigm
of
that.
it
created
this
209(b)
option
for
states
to
participate.
this
court
talked
about
it
in
the
gray
panthers
case.
there
were
other
expansions
that
have
taken
place,
such
as
the
1984
expansions,
where
they
didn't
give
states
that
option;
but,
here's
the
second
dimension
in
which
this
is
distinct,
which
is,
here,
congress
has
created
a
separate
part
of
the
program
for
the
newly
eligible
mandatory
individuals.
that's
what
they
called
them.
and
those
individuals
are
treated
separately
from
the
rest
of
the
program
going
forward
forever.
they
are
going
to
be
reimbursed
at
a
different
rate
from
everybody
who's
covered
under
the
preexisting
program.
now,
in
light
of
that
separation
by
congress
itself
of
the
newly
eligible
individuals
from
the
rest
of
the
program,
it's
very
hard
to
understand
congress's
decision
to
say,
look
if
you
don't
want
to
cover
these
newly
eligible
individuals,
you
don't
just
not
get
the
new
money,
you
don't
get
any
of
the
money
under
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
says
--
well,
it
--
where
does
it
say
what,
justice
breyer?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
says
it
--
there's
two
places
where
it
says
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
2001a3
makes
it
part
of
my
brief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
at
page
23
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--blue
brief.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
this
makes
not
the
point
about
the
funding
cutoff.
this
makes
the
point
just
that
these
newly
eligible
individuals
are
really
treated
separately
forevermore.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
and
there,
justice
breyer--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
have
that
with
me--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--great.
perfect.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
that's
the
--
if
that
is
the
provision
that
gives
the
secretary--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--among
other
things--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
authority
to
cut
off
all
participation
in
the
program,
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
justice
breyer,
here's
where
it
comes
from,
which
is
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
litigation,
we've
pointed
out
that
what's
coercive
is
not
the
absolute
guarantee
that
the
secretary
could
cut
off
every
penny,
but
the
fact
that
she
could.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
doesn't
for
this
reason,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but
here's
the
reason.
here's
the
reason,
justice
breyer,
it
doesn't.
one
is,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
the
opinion
to
cite
for
that
proposition.
second
is,
we
have
been
making
in
this
litigation
since
the
very
beginning
this
basic
point,
the
government
has
had
opportunities
at
every
level
of
this
system,
and
i
suppose
they
will
have
an
opportunity
today
to
say,
"fear
not,
states,
if
you
don't
want
to
take
the
new
conditions,
all
you
will
lose
is
the
new
money.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and,
justice
scalia,
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
the
way
i
would
read
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
if
i
could
just
add
one
thing
just
to
the
discussion
is
the
point
that,
you
know,
this
is
not
all
hypothetical.
i
mean,
in
--
there
was
a
record
in
the
district
court,
and
there
is
an
exhibit
33
to
our
motion
to
summary
judgment.
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
can
lodge
it
with
the
court
if
you'd
like.
but
it's
a
letter
in
the
record
in
this
litigation,
and
it's
a
letter
from
the
secretary
to
arizona,
when
arizona
floated
the
idea
that
it
would
like
to
withdraw
from
the
chip
program,
which
is
a
relatively
small
part
of
the
whole
program.
and
what
arizona
was
told
by
the
secretary
is
that
if
you
withdraw
from
the
chip
program,
you
risk
losing
$7.8
billion,
the
entirety
of
your
medicaid
participation.
so
this
is
not
something
that
we've
conjured
up--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court's
federalism
jurisprudence
should
force
states
to
defend
on
how
a
lower
court
reads
holly
hill.
i
think
that
really
right
here
what
we
know
to
an
absolute
certainty
is
that
this
secretary
--
this
statute
gives
the
secretary
the
right
to
remove
all
of
the
state's
funding
under
these
programs.
think
about
what
that
is,
just--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor,
we
are
not
saying
we
have
a
vested
right
to
participate
in
the
medicaid
program
as
it
exists
now.
so
if
congress
wanted
to
scrap
the
current
system
and
have
a
new
one,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
coercion
challenge
to
it,
but
i'm
not
going
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
can--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
before
--
i
mean,
i
will
try
to
answer
that
question,
too.
but
the
first
part
of
the
question
was,
what
if
congress
just
tried
to
scrap
this
and
start
over
again
with
a
new
program?
here's
why
this
is
fundamentally
different
and
why
it's
fundamentally
more
coercive,
because
congress
is
not
saying
we
want
to
scrap
this
program.
they
don't
have
a
single
complaint,
really,
with
the
way
that
states
are
providing
services
to
the
visually
impaired
and
the
disabled
under
pre-existing
medicaid.
and
that's
why
it's
particularly
questionable
why
they
are
saying
that
if
you
don't
take
our
new
money
subject
to
the
new
conditions,
we
are
going
to
take
all
of
the
money
you
have
previously
gotten,
that
you
have
been
dependent
on
for
45
years
and
you
are
using
right
now
to
serve
the
visually
impaired
and
the
disabled--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
that's
right,
but
that
shouldn't
be
a
terrible
concern,
because
if
congress
wants
to
do
what
it
did
in
1972,
and
pass
a
statute
that
makes
the
expansion
voluntary,
every
state
that
thinks
that
this
is
a
great
deal
can
sign
up.
what's
telling
here,
though,
is
26
states,
who
think
that
this
is
a
bad
deal
for
them,
actually
are
also
saying
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
take
this
because
they
can't
afford
to
have
their
entire
participation
in
this
45-year-old
program
wiped
out,
and
they
have
to
go
back
to
square
one
and
figure
out
how
they
are
going
to
deal
with
the
visually
impaired
in
their
state,
the
disabled
in
their
state--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there's
a
correlation,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
two
reasons
that
might
be
different.
one
is
this
whole
line
of
coercion
only
applies
--
is
only
relevant,
really,
when
congress
tries
to
do
something
through
the
spending
power
it
couldn't
do
directly.
so
if
congress
tried
to
impose
title
ix
directly,
i
guess
the
question
for
this
court
would
be
whether
or
not
section
5
of
the
14th
amendment
allowed
congress
to
do
that?
i
imagine
you
might
think
that
it
did
and
i
imagine
some
of
your
colleagues
might
take
issue
with
that,
but
that's
--
that's
the
nature
of
the
question.
so
one
way
around
that
would
be
if
congress
can
do
it
directly,
you
don't
even
have
to
ask
whether
there
is
something
special
about
the
spending
power.
that's
how
this
court
resolved,
for
example,
the
ferra
case
about
funding
to
--
to
colleges.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
going
--
to
say
the
second
thing
about
my
answer
to
your
prior
question
was
just,
i
also
think
that,
you
know,
it
may
be
that
spending
on
certain
private
universities
is
something
again
that
congress
can
do,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
coercion,
but
when
they
are
trying
to
get
the
states
to
expand
their
medicaid
programs,
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
then
there
--
then
there
may
be
some
limits
on
that
--
i
mean,
but
again,
i'm
not
sure
even
in
that
context
there
might
not
be
some
things
congress
can
do.
it's
a
separate
question.
but
once
we
take
a
premise,
which
i
don't
think
there
is
a
disagreement
here,
that
congress
could
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
direct
legislation
under
the
commerce
power
or
something
say,
states,
you
must
expand
your
medicaid
programs.
if
we
take
that
as
a
given,
then
i
think
we
have
to
ask
the
question
about
whether
or
not
it's
coercive.
now,
you
--
in
your
second
question
you
ask,
well,
you
know,
i
mean,
where's
the
case
that
says
that
we've
crossed
that
line.
and
this
is
that
case,
i
would
respectfully
say.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
that
our
position
here
would
necessarily
extend
to
say
the
1984
amendments,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
you
know,
i'm
--
i'm
i
am
not
saying
that
absolutely
that's
guaranteed
that's
not
coercive,
but
here's
reasons
why
they're
different.
the
one
major
difference
is
of
the
size
of
the
program.
i
mean,
the
expansion
of
medicaid
since
1984
is
really
breathtaking.
medicaid,
circa,
1984
the
federal
spending
to
the
states
was
a
shade
over
$21
billion.
right
now
it's
$250
billion,
and
that's
before
the
expansion
under
this
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
necessarily,
justice
kagan.
and
again,
it's
because
we
are
not
here
with
a
one
trick
pony.
one
of
the
factors
--
we
point
you
to
three
factors
that
make
this
statute
uniquely
coercive.
one
of
them
is
the
sheer
size
of
this
program.
and,
you
know,
if
you
want
a
gauge
on
the
size
of
this
program,
the
best
place
to
look
is
the
government's
own
number.
footnote
6,
page
73--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--$3.3
trillion
over
the
next
10
years.
that's
--
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
answer
is
no,
and
that's
because
we're
here
saying
there
are
three
things
that
make
this
statute
unique.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
one
is
the
sheer
size.
two
is
the
fact
that
this
statute
uniquely
is
tied
to
an
individual
mandate
which
is
decidedly
nonvoluntary.
and
three
is
the
fact
that
they've
leveraged
the
prior
participation
in
the
program,
notwithstanding
that
they've
broken
this
out
as
a
separately
segregated
fund
going
forward,
which
is
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
think
that
is
constitutional
because
i
think
that's
something
that
congress
could
do
directly.
it
wouldn't
have
to
limit
that
to
the
spending
program.
and
i
think
18
u.s.c.
666
is
--
is
a
statute
--
it's
in
the
criminal
code,
it
may
be
tied
to
spending,
but
i
think
that's
--
that's
a
provision
that
i
don't
think
it's
constitutional;
i
think
it's
called
into
question.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i
think
there's
a
difference,
but
if
i'm
wrong
about
that
and
the
consequence
is
that
congress
has
to
break
medicaid
down
into
remotely
manageable
pieces
as
opposed
to
$3.3
trillion
over
10
years
before
the
expansion,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
world.
but
i
really
would
ask
you
to
focus
on
specifically
what's
going
on
here,
which
is
they
take
these
newly
eligible
people
--
and
that's
a
massive
change
in
the
way
the
program
works.
these
are
people
who
are
healthy,
childless
adults
who
are
not
covered
in
many
states.
they
say
okay,
we're
going
to
make
you
cover
those.
we're
going
to
have
a
separate
program
for
how
you
get
reimbursed
for
that.
you
get
reimbursed
differently
from
all
the
previously
eligible
individuals.
but
if
you
don't
take
our
money,
we're
going
to
take
away
your
participation
in
the
program
for
the
visually
impaired
and
disabled.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
sotomayor,
a
couple
of
points.
one
is,
i
actually
think
that
sort
of
misdescribes
what
happened
with
medicaid.
i
mean,
states
were,
as
you
suggest,
providing
for
the
poor
and
the
visually
impaired
and
disabled
even
before
medicaid
came
along.
then
all
of
a
sudden,
states
--
the
federal
government
says
look,
we'd
like
to
help
you
with
that,
and
we're
going
to
give
you
money
voluntarily.
and
then
over
time,
they
give
more
money
with
more
conditions,
and
now
they
decide
they're
going
to
totally
expand
the
program,
and
they
say
that
you
have
to
give
up
even
your
prior
program,
where
we
--
first
came
in
and
offered
you
cooperation,
we're
now
going
to
say
you
have
to
give
that
up
if
you
don't
take
our
new
conditions.
secondarily,
i
do
think
that
our
principle
is
not
that
when
you
get
past
a
certain
level,
it
automatically
becomes
coercive
per
se.
but
i
do
think
when
you
get
a
program
and
you're
basically
telling
states
that
look,
we're
going
to
take
away
$3.3
trillion
over
the
next
10
years,
that
at
that
point,
it's
okay
to
insist
that
congress
be
a
little
more
careful
that
it
not
be
so
aggressively
coercive
as
it
was
in
this
statute.
and
i
would
simply
say
that
--
we're
not
here
to
tell
you
that
this
is
going
to
be
an
area
where
it's
going
to
be
very
easy
to
draw
the
line.
we're
just
telling
you
that
it's
inceptionally
important
to
draw
that
line,
and
this
is
a
case
where
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
establish
a
beachhead,
say
that
coercion
matters,
say
there's
three
factors
of
this
particular
statute
that
make
it
as
obviously
coercive
as
any
piece
of
legislation
that
you've
ever
seen,
and
then
you
will
have
effectively
instructed
congress
that
there
are
limits,
and
you
have
laid
down
some
administrable
rules.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
yes.
it
is.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
well
--
it
is.
but
i
mean
--
i
might
have
missed
something,
but
both
of
those
seem
to
be
coercion.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
wouldn't
do
that
either,--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
both,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that's
--
i
mean,
there
really
is
--
i
--
there
really
is,
you
know,
three
strings
in
this
bow.
i
mean,
one
is,
the
sheer
amount
of
money
here
makes
it
very,
very
difficult
to
refuse,
because
it's
not
money
that,
you
know,
that's
come
from
some
--
you
know,
china
or,
you
know,
the
--
the
--
the
export
tariffs
like
in
the
old
day.
it's
coming
from
the
taxpayers,
so
that's
part
of
it.
the
fact
that
they're
being
asked
to
give
up
their
continuing
participation
in
a
program
that
they've
been
participating
in
for
45
years
as
a
condition
to
accept
the
new
program,
we
think
that's
the
second
thing
that's
critical--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
all
due
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that,
you
know,
the
states
have
gotten
pretty
dependent,
so
let's
call
this
whole
federalism
thing
off.
and
i
just
think
it's
too
important.
because
again,
the
consequence
--
if
you
think
about
it
--
if
--
the
consequence
of
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
police
the
coercion
line
here
shouldn't
be
that
well,
you
know,
it's
just
too
hard,
so
we'll
give
the
federal
congress
unlimited
spending
power.
the
consequence
ought
to
be,
if
you
really
can't
police
this
line,
then
you
should
go
back
and
reconsider
your
cases
that
say
that
congress
can
spend
money
on
things
that
it
can't
do
directly.
now,
we're
not
asking
you
to
go
that
far.
we're
simply
saying
that
look,
your
spending
power
cases
absolutely
depend
on
there
being
a
line
between
coercion--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
voluntary
action.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
--
it
certainly
can,
justice
sotomayor.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
in
answering
justice
kagan's
question
that
my
case
was
no
better
than
that
hypothetical.
i
mean,
but
if
in
the
nature
of
things
that
i
do
think
the
amount
of
the
money
even
considered
alone
does
make
a
difference,
and
it's
precisely
because
it
has
an
effect
on
their
ability
to
raise
revenue
from
their
own
citizens.
so
it's
not
just
free
money
that
they
are
turning
down
if
they
want
to.
it
really
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
then--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
then
i
will
make
that
argument
on
behalf
of
texas.
but
it's
not,
it's
not
what
my
argument
depends
on.
and
that's
the
critical
thing.
it's
one
aspect
of
what
makes
this
statute
uniquely
coercive.
and
i
really
think
if
you
ask
the
question:
what
explains
the
idea
that
if
you
don't
take
this
new
money
you
are
going
to
lose
all
your
money
under
what
you
have
been
doing
for
45
years
to
help
out
the
visually
impaired
and
disabled?
nobody
in
congress
wants
the
states
to
stop
doing
that.
they
are
just
doing
it,
and
it's
purely
coercive
to
condition
the
money.
it's
leverage,
pure
and
simple.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
have,
and
i
would
like
to
elaborate
that
the
one
word
answer
is
"accountability".
if
the
federal
government
decides
to
spend
money
through
federal
instrumentalities
and
the
citizenry
is
hacked
off
about
it,
they
can
bring
a
federal
complaint
to
a
federal
official
working
in
a
federal
agency.
and
what
makes
this
so
pernicious
is
that
the
federal
government
knows
that
the
citizenry
is
not
going
to
take
lightly
the
idea
that
there
are
huge,
new
federal
bureaucracies
popping
up
across
the
country.
and
so
they
get
the
benefit
of
administering
this
program
through
state
officials,
but
then
it
makes
it
very
confusing
for
the
citizen
who
doesn't
like
this.
do
they
complain
to
the
state
official
because
it's
being
administered
in
the
state
official
in
a
state
building?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
that's
exactly
what
medicaid
was.
the
question
is:
what
will
it
be
going
forward?
and
i
absolutely
take
your
point,
justice
kagan.
cooperative
federalism
is
a
beautiful
thing.
mandatory
federalism
has
very
little
to
recommend
it
because
it
poses
exactly
the
kind
of
accountability--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
absolutely
agree
that
if
it's
cooperative
federalism
and
the
states
have
choices,
then
that
is
perfectly
okay.
but
when
--
that's
why
voluntariness
and
coercion
is
so
important.
because
if
you
force
a
state
to
participate
in
a
federal
program,
then
--
i
mean,
as
long
as
it's
voluntary
then
a
state
official
shouldn't
complain
if
a
citizen
complains
to
the
state
about
the
way
the
state's
administering
a
federal
program
that
it
volunteered
to
participate
in.
but
at
the
point
it
becomes
coercive,
then
it's
not
fair
to
tell
the
citizen
to
complain
to
the
state
official.
they
had
no
choice.
but
who
do
they
complain
at
the
federal
level?
there's
nobody
there,
which
would
be
--
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
best
solution
to
have
federal
instrumentalities
in
every
state,
but
it
actually
is
better
than
what
you
get
when
you
have
mandatory
federalism
and
you
lose
the
accountability
that
is
central
to
the
federalism
provisions
in
the
constitution.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all
we
talked
a
lot
about
the
sort
of
hallmark
of
coercion,
your
money
or
your
life,
with
somebody
with
a
gun.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it
is
equally
coercive
or
certainly
not
uncoercive
if
i
say
your
money
or
your
life,
and
by
the
way,
i
have
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
i
will
shoot
the
gun.
i
don't
think
that
eliminates
the
coercion.
i
also
don't
think
this
is
a
discretion
that
the
secretary
would
ever
be
able
to
exercise.
and
the
reason
is,
we
disagree
on
the
details,
but
the
solicitor
general
and
i
agree
that
over
the
years
congress
has
had
different
approaches
to
expanding
medicare.
sometimes,
as
in
1972,
it
makes
the
expansion
voluntary;
that's
also
by
the
way
that
happened
with
the
stimulus
funds,
which
were
voluntary
funds.
you
didn't
lose
all
your
medicaid
funds,
which
is
why
17
states
could
say
no.
sometimes
they
take
the
voluntary
approach.
sometimes,
as
in
1984,
they
take
the
mandatory
approach.
if
the
secretary
exercised
the
discretion
to
say
you
know
what,
it
really
isn't
reasonable
for
you
to
have
to
give
up
your
funding
for
the
visually
impaired
and
the
disabled
just
to
cover
these
newly
eligible
people,
so
we
will
make
it
voluntary;
we'll
make
that
discretionary
--
that
would
essentially
be
creating
--
converting
a
1984
amendment
approach
to
a
1972
amendment
approach,
and
i
just
don't
think
that
is
the
kind
of
discretion
that
the
secretary
has,
with
all
due
respect.
now
moving
on
to
the
next
point,
justice
alito,
your
hypothetical
i
think
aptly
captures
the
effect
on
this,
based
on
the
fact
that
these
tax
dollars
are
being
taken
from
the
state's
tax
base,
and
it's
not
like
steward
machine,
where
the
federal
government
would
say,
and
oh,
by
the
way,
if
you
don't
take
the
option
we
are
giving
you,
we
are
going
to
have
a
federal
substitute
that
will
go
in
and
we
will
take
care
of
the
unemployed
in
your
states.
here
if
you
don't
take
this
offer
we
are
giving
you,
your
tax
dollars
will
fund
the
other
49
states
and
you
will
get
nothing.
but
of
course,
this
situation
is
much
more
coercive
even
than
your
hypothetical,
because
it
is
tied
directly
to
the
mandate.
it's
also
tied
to
the
--
to
participation
in
the
preexisting
program.
so
it
is
as
if
there
was
yet
another
program
for
post-secondary
education;
they
gave
them
exactly
your
option
--
option
--
and
then
they
also
said,
oh,
and
by
the
way;
you
not
only
--
not
get
these
funds,
but
you
lose
the
post-secondary
fund
as
well.
it's
really
hard
to
understand
tying
the
preexisting
participation
in
the
program
as
anything
other
than
coercive.
the
solicitor
general
makes
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
there
are
optional
benefits
under
this
program.
well,
guess
what?
after
the
medicaid
expansion
there
will
be
a
lot
less
opportunity
for
the
states
to
exercise
those
options,
because
one
of
the
things
that
the
expansion
does
--
precisely
because
the
expansion
is
designed
to
convert
medicaid
into
a
program
that
satisfies
the
requirement
of
the
minimum
essential
cover
of
the
individual
mandate,
things
that
used
to
be
voluntary
will
no
longer
be
voluntary.
the
perfect
example
is
prescription
coverage.
it's
a
big
part
of
the
benefits
that
some
states
but
not
all
provide
voluntarily
now.
it
will
no
longer
be
voluntary
after
the
expansion,
because
the
federal
government
has
deemed
that
prescription
drugs
to
be
part
of
the
minimal
essential
health
coverage
that
everybody
in
this
country
must
have
after
the
manned
date.
so
that
option
that
the
state
has
is
being
removed
by
the
expansion
itself.
the
chief
justice
made
the
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
we
can
start
with
the
common
ground
that
there
is
a
need
for
repair
because
there
is
a
coercion
doctrine
and
this
statute
is
coercion,
then
we
are
into
the
question
of
remedy.
and
we
do
think,
we
do
take
the
position
that
you
describe
in
the
remedy,
but
we
would
be
certainly
happy
if
we
got
something
here,
and
we
got
a
recognition
that
the
coercion
doctrine
exists;
this
is
coercive;
and
we
get
the
remedy
that
you
suggest
in
the
alternative.
let
me
just
finish
by
saying
i
certainly
appreciate
what
the
solicitor
general
says,
that
when
you
support
a
policy,
you
think
that
the
policy
spreads
the
blessings
of
liberty.
but
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
a
very
funny
conception
of
liberty
that
forces
somebody
to
purchase
an
insurance
policy
whether
they
want
it
or
not.
and
it's
a
very
strange
conception
of
federalism
that
says
that
we
can
simply
give
the
states
an
offer
that
they
can't
refuse,
and
through
the
spending
power
which
is
premised
on
the
notion
that
congress
can
do
more
because
it's
voluntary,
we
can
force
the
states
to
do
whatever
we
tell
them
to.
that
is
a
direct
threat
to
our
federalism.
thank
you.
