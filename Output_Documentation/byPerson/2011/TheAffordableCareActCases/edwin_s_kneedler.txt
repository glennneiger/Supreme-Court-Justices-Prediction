mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
should
be
no
occasion
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
consider
issues
of
severability,
because
as
we
argue,
the
--
the
minimum
coverage
provision
is
fully
consistent
with
article
i
of
the
constitution.
but
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
otherwise,
it
should
reject
petitioners'
sweeping
proposition
that
the
entire
act
must
fall
if
this
one
provision
is
held
unconstitutional.
as
an
initial
matter,
we
believe
the
court
should
not
even
consider
that
question.
the
vast
majority
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
do
not
even
apply
to
the
petitioners,
but
instead
apply
to
millions
of
citizens
and
businesses
who
are
not
before
the
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
--
i
think
the
continuing
validity
of
any
particular
provision
would
arise
in
litigation
that
would
otherwise
arise
under
that
provision
by
parties
who
are
actually--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
--
the
point
isn't
that
there
has
to
be
a
--
an
affirmative
cause
of
action
to
decide
this.
you
could
--
for
example,
to
use
the
medicare
reimbursement
issue
is,
one
of
the
things
that
this
act
does
is
change
medicare
reimbursement
rates.
well,
the
place
where
someone
adjudicates
the
validity
of
medicare
reimbursement
rates
is
through
the
special
statutory
review
procedure
for
that.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
anti-injunction
act--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that
proves
our
point,
justice
scalia.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
just
because
there's
--
no
one
may
have
standing
to
challenge
--
and
particularly
like
tax
credits
or
taxes
which
are
challenged
only
after
going
through
the
anti-injunction
act
--
just
because
no
one
has
standing
doesn't
mean
that
someone
must.
but
beyond
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
--
this
case
is
directly
parallel
to
the
printz
case,
in
our
view.
in
that
case,
the
court
struck
down
several
provisions
of
the
brady
act,
but
went
on
to
say
it
had
no
business
addressing
the
severability
of
other
provisions
that
did
not
apply
to
the
people
before
whom--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
we
think
that
is
the
proper
way
to
proceed.
severability--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
the
court
should
leave
it
to
congress
for
two
reasons.
one
is
the
point
i'm
making
now
about
justiciability,
or
whether
the
court
can
properly
consider
it
at
all.
and
the
second
is,
we
think
only
a
few
provisions
are
inseverable
from
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
i
just
would
like
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
no.
we
--
we
believe
that
in
that
case,
the
--
the
tax
--
the
tax
provision
should
not
be
struck
down.
in
the
first
place,
the
anti-injunction
act
would
bar
a
--
a
direct
suit
to
challenge
it.
it
would
be
very
strange
to
allow
a
tax
to
be
struck
down
on
the
basis
of
a
severability
analysis.
severability
arises
in
a
case
only
where
it's
necessary
to
consider
what
relief
a
party
before
the
court
should
get.
the
only
party--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
--
the
fact
that
that's
such
a
clause
might
make
it
easy
doesn't
change
the
point.
article
iii
jurisdictional
problems
apply
to
easy
questions
as
well
as
--
as
hard
questions.
if
i
could
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
--
this
court
had
said
that
one
has
--
has
to
have
standing
for
every
degree
of
relief
that
--
that
is
sought.
that
was
in
davis,
that
was
los
angeles
v.
lyons.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--daimler/chrysler--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
as
a
matter
of
judicial
restraint,
limits
on
equitable
remedial
power
limit
this
court
to
addressing
the
provision
that
has
been
challenged
as
unconstitutional
and
anything
else
that
the
plaintiff
seeks
as
relief.
here
the
only--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
--
i
think
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not,
justice
kennedy
and
then
i
--
i
will
move
on.
but
this
is
exactly
the
situation
in
printz.
the
court
identified
the
severability
questions
that
were
--
that
were
briefed
before
the
court
as
important
ones,
but
said
that
they
affect
people
who
are
--
rights
and
obligations
of
people
who
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
think
that
matters
of
justiciability
do
blend
into--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--blend
into,
blend
into
discretion,
and
in
turn
blend
into
the
merits
of
the
severability
question.
and
as
to
that,
just
to
answer
a
question
that,
that
several
justices
have
asked,
we
think
that
severability
is
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
should
be
resolved
by
looking
at
the
structure
and
the
text
of
the
act,
and
the
court
may
look
at
legislative
history
to
figure
out
what
the
text
and
structure
mean
with
respect
to
severability.
we
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
is,
that
is
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
correct,
and
i'd
also
like
to
--
going
--
i
just
want
to
finish
the
thought
i
had
about
this
being
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
court's
task,
we
submit,
is
not
to
look
at
the
legislative
process
to
see
whether
the
bill
would
been
--
would
have
passed
or
not
based
on
the
political
situation
at
the
time,
which
would
basically
convert
the
court
into
a
function
such
as
a
whip
count.
that
is
not
the
court's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
as
i
said,
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i
think
in
this
case
there
is
an
easy
answer,
and
that
is,
justice
kagan
pointed
out
that,
that
the
act
itself
creates
a
sharp
dividing
line
between
the
minimum
coverage
provision
--
the
package
of
--
of
reforms:
the
minimum
coverage
provision
along
with
the
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating.
that
is
one
package
that
congress
deemed
essential.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
in
congress's
findings
that
the
--
that
the
minimum
coverage
provision
--
without
it
the
court
--
the
--
congress
said,
in
finding
i,
without
that
provision
people
would
wait
to
get
insurance,
and
therefore
--
and
cause
all
the
adverse
selection
problems
that
arise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it
does,
because
congress
said
it
was
essential
to
those
provisions,
but
it
conspicuously
did
not
say
that
it
was
essential
to
other
provisions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
--
i
mean,
first
of
all,
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
text
and
legislative
history
to
try
to
figure
out
how
the
finances
of
the
bill
operate,
it
--
it's
like
being
a
budget
committee.
but
--
but
we
think
the,
the
economists
had
added
up
the
figures
wrong.
if
there
is
medicaid
expansion,
the
insurance
--
and
the
insurance
companies
are
involved
in
that,
they
are
going
to
be
reimbursed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
that
would
have
any
effect.
that
could
be
addressed
in
the
next
argument.
but
we
don't
think
that
would
have
any
effect
on
the
--
on
the
rest
of
the
--
on
the
rest
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
it's
--
in
the
past
congress
has
expanded
medicaid
coverage
without
there
being
--
it's
done
it
many
times
without
there
being
a
minimum
coverage
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
don't
think
it's
in
the
court's
place
to
look
at
the,
at
the
budgetary
implications,
and
we
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
when
you
--
when
you
are
talking
about
monetary
consequences,
you
are
looking
through
the
act,
you
are
looking
behind
the
act,
rather
than
--
the
court's
function
is
to
look
at
the
text
and
structure
of
the
act
and
what
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
themselves
mean.
and
if
i
could
go
past--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
booker
is
the
best
example
of
that.
in
--
in
booker
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
were
central
to
the
act,
but
the
court
said
congress
would
have
preferred
a
statute
without
the
mandatory
provision
in
the
act,
and
the
court
struck
that
but
the
rest
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
remained.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
no
example--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
our
--
to
our
--
that
we
have
found
that
suggests
the
contrary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
act
point
in
a
moment.
but
what
i'd
like
to
say
is
this
is
a
huge
act
with
many
provisions
that
are
completely
unrelated
to
market
reforms
and
operate
in
different
ways.
and
we
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
in
this
extraordinary
act
to
strike
all
of
that
down
because
there
are
many
provisions
and
it
would
be
too
hard
to
do
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
--
i
just
don't
think
that
is
realistic.
the
court
would
be
doing
it
without
the
parties,
the
millions
of
parties--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
just
--
it
just
is
not
something
that
a
court
would
ordinarily
do.
but
i
would
like--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
--
and
--
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
it
again
in
terms
of
the
text
and
structure
of
the
act.
we
have
very
important
indications
from
the
structure
of
this
act
that
the
whole
thing
is
not
supposed
to
fall.
the
--
the
most
basic
one
is,
the
notion
that
congress
would
have
intended
the
whole
act
to
fall
if
there
couldn't
be
a
minimum
coverage
provision
is
refuted
by
the
fact
that
there
are
many,
many
provisions
of
this
act
already
in
effect
without
a
minimum
coverage
provision.
two
point
--
2
and-a-half
million
people
under
26
have
gotten
insurance
by
one
of
the
insurance
requirements.
three
point
two
billion
dollars--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
no
reason
to
think
it's
going
to
--
it's
going
to
bankrupt
anyone.
the
costs
will
be
set
to
cover
those
--
to
cover
those
amounts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
two
and-a-half
--
2.5
million
people
would
be
thrown
off
the
insurance
roles
if
the
court
were
to
say
that.
congress
made
many
changes
to
medicare
rates
that
have
gone
into
effect
for
the
congress
--
for
the
courts
to
have
to
unwind
millions
of
medicare
reimbursement
rates.
medicare
has
--
has
covered
32
million
insurance
--
preventive
care
visits
by
patients
as
a
result
of
--
of
this
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
a
question
of
legislative
intent,
and
we
have
a
very
fundamental
indication
of
legislative
intent
that
congress
did
not
mean
the
whole
act
to
fall
if
--
if
--
without
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
because
we
have
many
provisions
that
are
operating
now
without
that.
but
there's
a
further
indication
about
why
the
line
should
be
drawn
where
i've
suggested,
which
is
the
package
of
these
particular
provisions.
all
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
would
continue
to
advance
congress's
goal,
the
test
that
was
articulated
in
booker
but
it's
been
said
in
regan
and
other
cases.
you
look
to
whether
the
other
provisions
can
continue
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
act.
here
they
unquestionably
can.
the
public
health
--
the
broad
public
health
purposes
of
the
act
that
are
unrelated
to
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
but
also
that
the
other
provisions
designed
to
enhance
access
to
affordable
care.
the
employer
responsibility
provision,
the
credit
for
small
businesses,
which
is
already
in
effect,
by
the
way,
and
affecting
many
small
businesses--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
question
for
the
court
is
congress
having
passed
the
law
by
whatever
majority
there
might
be
in
one
house
or
the
other,
congress
having
passed
the
law,
what
at
that
point
is
--
is
--
is
the
legislative
intent
embodied
in
the
law
congress
has
actually
passed?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
with
respect,
i
disagree,
because
i
think
it's
evident
that
congress's
purpose
was
to
expand
access
to
affordable
care.
it
did
it
in
discreet
ways.
it
did
it
by
the
penalty
on
employers
that
don't
--
that
don't
offer
suitable
care.
it
did
it
by
offering
tax
credits
to
small
employers.
it
did
it
by
offering
tax
credits
to
purchasers.
all
of
those
are
a
variety
of
ways
that
continue
to
further
congress's
goal,
and
--
and
most
of
all,
medicaid,
which
is
--
which
is
unrelated
to
the
--
to
the
private
insurance
market
altogether.
and
in
adopting
those
other
provisions
governing
employers
and
whatnot,
congress
built
on
its
prior
experience
of
using
the
tax
code,
which
it
is
--
for
a
long
period
of
time
congress
has
subsidized--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
employer
coverage
--
150
million
people
in
this
country
already
get
their
insurance
through
--
through
their
employers.
what
congress
did
in
seeking
to
augment
that
was
to
add
a
provision
requiring
employers
to
purchase
insurance--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
--
i
--
i
think
any
cost
assumptions
--
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
made
any
cost
assumptions,
but
--
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
individual
--
that
the
individual
market,
which
is
where
the
minimum
coverage
provision
is
directed,
would
affect
that.
i
would
like
to
say
--
i
would
point
out
why
the
other
things
would
advance
congress's
goal.
the
point
here
is
that
the
package
of
three
things
would
--
would
be
contrary
--
would
run
contrary
to
congress's
goal
if
you
took
out
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
and
here's
why
--
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
findings:
if
you
take
out
minimum
coverage
but
leave
in
the
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating,
you
will
make
matters
worse.
rates
will
go
up,
and
people
will
be
less
--
fewer
people
covered
in
the
individual
market.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
those
are
--
what
congress
--
congress
did
not
think
of
those
things
as
balancing
insurance
companies.
insurance
companies
are
participants
in
the
market
for
medicaid
and
--
and
other
things.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
because
--
that's
because
i
think
this
court's
function
is
to
look
at
the
text
and
structure
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
law
that
congress
enacted,
not
the
financial
--
not
a
financial
balance
sheet,
which
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
law.
and
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
do.
that's
--
that's
--
and
it's
not
just
the
text
of
the
act,
but
the
background
of
the
act,
the
experience
in
the
state,
the
testimony
of
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners.
that's
the
--
that's
the
problem
congress
was
addressing.
there
was
a
--
there
was
--
a
shifting
of
present
actuarial
risks
in
that
market
that
congress
wanted
to
correct.
and
if
you
took
the
minimum
coverage
provision
out
and
left
the
other
two
provisions
in,
there
would
be
laid
on
top
of
the
existing
shifting
of
present
actuarial
risks
an
additional
one
because
the
uninsured
would
know
that
they
would
have
guaranteed
access
to
insurance
whenever
they
became
sick.
it
would
make
the
--
it
would
make
the
adverse
selection
in
that
market
problem
even
worse.
and
so
what
--
and
congress,
trying
to
come
up
with
a
market-based
solution
to
control
rates
in
that
market,
has
adopted
something
that
would
--
that
would
work
to
control
costs
by
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating;
but,
if
you
--
if
--
if
you
take
out
the
minimum
coverage,
that
won't
work.
that
was
congress's
assumption,
again,
shown
by
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
this
provision.
and
that's
why
we
think
those
things
rise
or
fall
in
a
package
because
they
cut
against
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
all
of
the
other
provisions
would
actually
increase
access
to
affordable
care
and
would
have
advantageous
effects
on
price.
again,
congress
was
invoking
its
traditional
use
of
the
tax
code,
which
has
long
subsidized
insurance
through
employers,
has
used
that
to
impose
a
tax
penalty
on
employers,
to
give
tax
credits.
this
is
traditional
stuff
that
congress
has
done.
and
the
other
thing
congress
has
done,
those
preexisting
laws
had
their
own
protections
for
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating.
effectively,
within
the
large
employer
plans,
they
can't
discriminate
among
people,
they
can't
charge
different
rates.
what
congress
was
doing,
was
doing
that
in
the
other
market.
if
it
can't,
that's
all
that
should
be
struck
from
the
act.
