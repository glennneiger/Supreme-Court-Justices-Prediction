justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
why
don't
we
simply
follow
the
statutory
language?
i
know
that
you've
argued
that
the
davis
case
has
been
overtaken
by
later
cases,
but
the
language
of
the
anti-injunction
act
is
"no
suit
shall
be
maintained".
it's
remarkably
similar
to
the
language
in
--
that
was
at
issue
in
reed
elsevier:
"no
civil
action
for
infringement
shall
be
instituted.
"
and
that
formulation,
"no
suit
may
be
maintained",
contrasts
with
the
tax
injunction
act,
that
says
the
district
court
shall
not
enjoin.
that
tax
injunction
act
is
the
same
pattern
as
2283,
which
says
"courts
of
the
united
states
may
not
stay
a
proceeding
in
state
court.
"
so
both
of
those
formulas,
the
tia
and
the
no
injunction
against
proceedings
in
state
court,
are
directed
to
"court".
the
anti-injunction
act,
like
the
statute
at
issue
in
reed
elsevier,
says
"no
suit
shall
be
maintained",
and
it
has
been
argued
that
that
is
suitor-directed
in
contrast
to
court-directed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
is
that
different
from
no
civil
action
for
infringement
shall
be
instituted
--
"maintained
and
instituted"?
anything
turn
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
you
--
you
said
before
--
and
i
think
you
were
quite
right
--
that
the
tax
injunction
act
is
modeled
on
the
anti-injunction
act,
and,
under
the
tax
injunction
act,
what
can't
be
enjoined
is
an
assessment
for
the
purpose
of
raising
revenue.
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
apply
to
penalties
that
are
designed
to
induce
compliance
with
the
law
rather
than
to
raise
revenue.
and
this
is
not
a
revenue-raising
measure,
because,
if
it's
successful,
they
won't
--
nobody
will
pay
the
penalty
and
there
will
be
no
revenue
to
raise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
long,
there's
another
argument
that
has
been
made
that
i
would
like
you
to
address,
and
that
is
all
this
talk
about
tax
penalties
is
all
beside
the
point
because
this
suit
is
not
challenging
the
penalty.
this
is
a
suit
that
is
challenging
the
must-buy
provision,
and
the
argument
is
made
that,
if,
indeed,
"must-buy"
is
constitutional,
then
these
complainants
will
not
resist
the
penalty.
so
what
they're
seeking
is
a
determination
that
that
"must-buy"
requirement,
stated
separately
from
penalty,
that
"must-buy"
is
unconstitutional,
and,
if
that's
so,
that's
the
end
of
the
case;
if
it's
not
so,
they
are
not
resisting
the
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that's
--
if
that's
the
problem,
it's
easier
to
amend
the
complaint.
they
can
just
take
that
out
of
the
complaint.
so
it
can't
turn
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
a
basic
question
about
your
argument.
if
you
are
right
about
the
second
part,
that
is
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
anti-injunction
statute,
this
penalty
does
not
constitute
a
tax,
then
does
the
court
need
to
decide
whether
the
anti-injunction
act
in
other
cases
where
it
does
involve
a
tax
is
jurisdictional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then,
general,
what
i
asked
you
is,
if
you're
right
that
this
penalty
is
not
covered
by
section
7421,
if
you're
right
about
that,
why
should
we
deal
with
the
jurisdictional
question
at
all?
because
this
statute,
correct,
the
way
you
reading
--
read
it,
doesn't
involve
a
tax
that's
subject
to
the
anti-injunction
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
you
--
you
agree
that
we
would
not
--
if
we
agree
with
you
about
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute,
we
need
not
decide
the
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i
ask--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
--
how
likely
is
it
--
i
mean,
the
government
is
going
to
be
defending
these
suits,
how
likely
is
it
that
the
government
will
overlook
the
anti-injunction
act?
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
arming
the
government
by
saying
it's
waivable
at
the
government's
option.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
in
reed
elsevier,
you
were
dividing
jurisdiction
from
claims
processing,
says
you
have
to
register
before
you
can
sue.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
have
to
do
before
you
can
sue.
so
why
isn't
reed
elsevier
like
you
have
to
pay
a
filing
fee
before
you
can
file
a
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
statutory
construction
argument,
is
there
any
other
exaction
imposed
under
the
internal
revenue
codes
that
would
not
qualify
as
a
tax
for
anti-injunction
act
purposes,
or
is
5000a
just
out
there
all
by
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
are
different
things.
this
said
the
reed
elsevier
statute
says
immediately
after
instituted
unless
a
copyright
is
registered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
like
a
filing
fee,
before
you
can
maintain
a
suit
for
copyright
infringement,
you
have
to
register
your
copyright?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
somebody
not
choose
to
obtain
it?
why
--
that's
one
puzzle
to
me.
there's
this
category
of
people
who
are
medicaid
eligible;
medicaid
doesn't
cost
them
anything.
why
would
they
resist
enrolling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
may
be
just
that
they
haven't
been
given
sufficient
information
to
understand
that
this
is
a
benefit
for
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
going
to
have
insurance,
that's
how
insurance
works.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
i
thought
that
your
main
point
is
that,
unlike
food
or
any
other
market,
when
you
made
the
choice
not
to
buy
insurance,
even
though
you
have
every
intent
in
the
world
to
self-insure,
to
save
for
it,
when
disaster
strikes,
you
may
not
have
the
money.
and
the
tangible
result
of
it
is
--
we
were
told
there
was
one
brief
that
maryland
hospital
care
bills
7
percent
more
because
of
these
uncompensated
costs,
that
families
pay
a
thousand
dollars
more
than
they
would
if
there
were
no
uncompensated
costs.
i
thought
what
was
unique
about
this
is
it's
not
my
choice
whether
i
want
to
buy
a
product
to
keep
me
healthy,
but
the
cost
that
i
am
forcing
on
other
people
if
i
don't
buy
the
product
sooner
rather
than
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
can
we
--
can
we
go
back
to,
justice
breyer
asked
a
question,
and
it
kind
of
interrupted
your
answer
to
my
question.
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
i
thought
a
major,
major
point
of
your
argument
was
that
the
people
who
don't
participate
in
this
market
are
making
it
much
more
expensive
for
the
people
who
do;
that
is,
they
--
they
will
get,
a
good
number
of
them
will
get
services
that
they
can't
afford
at
the
point
where
they
need
them,
and
the
result
is
that
everybody
else's
premiums
get
raised.
so
you're
not
--
it's
not
your
--
your
free
choice
just
to
do
something
for
yourself.
what
you
do
is
going
to
affect
others,
affect
them
in
--
in
a
major
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
yesterday
you
told
me
--
you
listed
a
number
of
penalties
that
are
enforced
through
the
tax
code
that
are
not
taxes
and
they
are
not
penalties
related
to
taxes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
tax
is
to
raise
revenue,
tax
is
a
revenue-raising
device,
and
the
purpose
of
this
exaction
is
to
get
people
into
the
health
care
risk
--
risk
pool
before
they
need
medical
care,
and
so
it
will
be
successful.
if
it
doesn't
raise
any
revenue,
if
it
gets
people
to
buy
the
insurance,
that's
--
that's
what
this
penalty
is
--
this
penalty
is
designed
to
affect
conduct.
the
conduct
is
buy
health
protection,
buy
health
insurance
before
you
have
a
need
for
medical
care.
that's
what
the
penalty
is
designed
to
do,
not
to
raise
revenue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
doesn't
that
work
--
that
work
the
way
social
security
does?
let
me
put
it
this
way.
congress,
in
the
'30s,
saw
a
real
problem
of
people
needing
to
have
old
age
and
survivor's
insurance.
and
yes,
they
did
it
through
a
tax,
but
they
said
everybody
has
got
to
be
in
it
because
if
we
don't
have
the
healthy
in
it,
there's
not
going
to
be
the
money
to
pay
for
the
ones
who
become
old
or
disabled
or
widowed.
so
they
required
everyone
to
contribute.
it
was
a
big
fuss
about
that
in
the
beginning
because
a
lot
of
people
said
--
maybe
some
people
still
do
today
--
i
could
do
much
better
if
the
government
left
me
alone.
i'd
go
into
the
private
market,
i'd
buy
an
annuity,
i'd
make
a
great
investment,
and
they're
forcing
me
to
paying
for
this
social
security
that
i
don't
want;
but,
that's
constitutional.
so
if
congress
could
see
this
as
a
problem
when
we
need
to
have
a
group
that
will
subsidize
the
ones
who
are
going
to
get
the
benefits,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
saying
the
only
way
that
could
be
done
is
if
the
government
does
it
itself;
it
can't
involve
the
private
market,
it
can't
involve
the
private
insurers.
if
it
wants
to
do
this,
social
security
is
its
model.
the
government
has
to
do
--
has
to
be
government
takeover.
we
can't
have
the
insurance
industry
in
it.
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
problem
is
--
the
problem
is
this
they
are
making
the
reinvent
of
us
pay
for
it,
because
as
much
as
they
say,
well,
we
are
not
in
the
market,
we
don't
know
when
the
--
the
timing
when
they
will
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
the
figures
that
how
much
more
families
are
paying
for
insurance
because
people
get
sick,
they
may
have
intended
to
self-insure,
they
haven't
been
able
to
meet
the
bill
for
--
for
cancer,
and
the
rest
of
us
end
up
paying
because
these
people
are
getting
cost-free
health
care,
and
the
only
way
to
prevent
that
is
to
have
them
pay
sooner
rather
than
later,
pay
up
front.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
--
let
me
ask
a
question
i
asked
mr.
clement.
it
just
seems--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
just
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
there's
no
question
we
can
have
a
social
security
system
besides
all
the
people
who
say:
i'm
being
forced
to
pay
for
something
i
don't
want.
and
this
it
seems
to
me,
to
try
to
get
care
for
the
ones
who
need
it
by
having
everyone
in
the
pool,
but
is
also
trying
to
preserve
a
role
for
the
private
sector,
for
the
private
insurers.
there's
something
very
odd
about
that,
that
the
government
can
take
over
the
whole
thing
and
we
all
say,
oh,
yes,
that's
fine,
but
if
the
government
wants
to
get
--
to
preserve
private
insurers,
it
can't
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
wickard
was
you
must
buy;
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
use
the
home-grown
wheat.
you
have
got
to
go
out
in
the
market
and
buy
that
wheat
that
you
don't
want.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
common
ground
that
the
requirement
that
the
insurers
--
what
was
it,
the
community-based
one
and
they
have
to
insure
you
despite
your
health
status;
they
can't
refuse
because
of
preexisting
conditions.
the
government
tells
us
and
the
congress
determined
that
those
two
won't
work
unless
you
have
a
pool
that
will
include
the
people
who
are
now
healthy.
but
so
--
well,
first,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
the
community-based
--
and
what's
the
name
that
they
give
to
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
that
that
is
legitimate
commerce
clause
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
what
about
the
determination
that
they
can't
possibly
work
if
people
don't
have
to
buy
insurance
until
they
are
--
their
health
status
is
such
that
the
insurance
company
just
dealt
with
them
on
its
--
as
it
will?
i
won't
insure
you
because
you're
--
you're
already
sick.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
sick
people,
why
would
they
insure
early
if
they
had
to
be
protected
if
they
get
insurance
late?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
there
are
so
many
things
in
this
act
that
are
unquestionably
okay.
i
think
you
would
concede
that
reauthorizing
what
is
the
indian
healthcare
improvement
act
changes
to
long
benefits,
why
make
congress
redo
those?
i
mean
it's
a
question
of
whether
we
say
everything
you
do
is
no
good,
now
start
from
scratch,
or
to
say,
yes,
there
are
many
things
in
here
that
have
nothing
to
do
frankly
with
the
affordable
healthcare
and
there
are
some
that
we
think
it's
better
to
let
congress
to
decide
whether
it
wants
them
in
or
out.
so
why
should
we
say
it's
a
choice
between
a
wrecking
operation,
which
is
what
you
are
requesting,
or
a
salvage
job.
and
the
more
conservative
approach
would
be
salvage
rather
than
throwing
out
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
choice
between
someone
else
bringing
the
case
and
a
law
staying
in
place.
and
what
we're
really
talking
about,
as
justice
sotomayor
started
this
discussion,
is
who
is
the
proper
party
to
take
out
what
isn't
infected
by
the
court's
holding
--
with
all
these
provisions
where
there
may
be
no
standing,
one
institution
clearly
does
have
standing,
and
that's
congress.
and
if
congress
doesn't
want
the
provisions
that
are
not
infected
to
stand,
congress
can
take
care
of
it.
it's
a
question
of
which
--
which
side
--
should
the
court
say,
we're
going
to
wreck
the
whole
thing,
or
should
the
court
leave
it
to
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
relying
on
congress's
quite
explicitly
tying
these
three
things
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
kneedler
made
is
that
the
price
won't
be
affordable
because
--
he
spoke
of
the
adverse
selection
problem,
that
there
would
be
so
fewer
people
in
there,
the
insurance
companies
are
going
to
have
to
raise
the
premiums.
so
it's
nice
that
congress
made
it
possible
for
more
people
to
be
covered,
but
the
reality
is
they
won't
because
they
won't
be
able
to
afford
the
premium.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
true
of
every
medicaid
increase?
that
each
time
--
i
mean,
and
this
started
quite
many
years
ago,
and
congress
has
added
more
people
and
given
more
benefits
--
and
every
time,
the
condition
is,
if
you
want
the
medicaid
program,
this
is
the
program,
take
it
or
leave
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
--
question
another
line.
you
represent,
what,
26
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
are
also
told
that
there
are
other
states
that
like
this
expansion
and
they
are
very
glad
to
have
it.
the
relief
that
you
are
seeking
is
to
say
the
whole
expansion
is
no
good,
never
mind
that
there
are
states
that
say,
we
don't
feel
coerced,
we
think
this
is
good.
you
are
--
you
are
saying
that
because
you
represent
a
sizeable
number
of
states,
you
can
destroy
this
whole
program,
even
though
there
may
be
as
many
states
that
want
it,
that
don't
feel
coerced,
the
states,
thinking
that
this
is
a
good
thing?
justice
ruth
bader

let
--
let
me
ask
you
another
thing,
mr.
--
mr.
clement.
most
colleges
and
universities
are
heavily
dependent
on
the
government
to
fund
their
research
programs
and
other
things.
and
that
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
and
then
title
ix
passes,
and
a
government
official
comes
around
and
say
--
says
to
the
colleges,
you
want
money
for
your
physics
labs
and
all
the
other
things
you
get
it
for,
then
you
have
to
create
an
athletic
program
for
girls.
and
the
recipient
says,
i
am
being
coerced,
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
i
can
give
up
all
the
funds
to
run
all
these
labs
that
we
have,
i
can't
give
it
up,
so
i'm
being
coerced
to
accept
this
program
that
i
don't
want.
why
doesn't
your
theory,
if
your
theory
is
any
good,
why
doesn't
it
work
any
time,
something
--
someone
receives
something
that
is
too
good
to
give
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
coercion
theory.
i
know
that
there
are
cases
of
ours
that
have
said
there
is
a
line
between
pressure
and
coercion,
but
we
have
never
had,
in
the
history
of
this
country
or
the
court,
any
federal
program
struck
down
because
it
was
so
good
that
it
becomes
coercive
to
be
in
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
--
let's
take
public
colleges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
bottom
line
in
this
case?
it
sounds
to
me
like
everything
you
said
would
be
to
the
effect
of,
if
congress
continued
to
do
things
on
a
voluntary
basis,
so
we
are
getting
these
new
eligibles,
and
say
states,
you
can
have
it
or
not,
you
can
preserve
the
program
as
it
existed
before,
you
can
opt
into
this.
but
you
are
not
asking
the
court
as
relief
to
say,
well,
that's
how
we
--
we
--
that's
how
we
cure
the
constitutional
infirmity;
we
say
this
has
to
be
on
a
voluntary
basis.
instead,
you
are
arguing
that
this
whole
medicaid
addition,
that
the
whole
expansion
has
to
be
nullified;
and
moreover,
the
entire
health
care
act.
instead
of
having
the
easy
repair,
you
say
that
if
we
accept
your
position,
everything
falls.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
1930s,
congress
responded
to
the
need
of
senior
citizens
for
old-age
and
survivors'
insurance.
it
did
so
by
making
social
security,
a
tax
based
entirely
federal
program.
in
2010,
congress
addressed
the
public's
need
for
affordable
health
care
when
sickness
or
injury
occurs.
congress
did
so
by
taking
a
path
unlike
the
one
it
took
for
social
security
instead
of
an
entirely
federal
program.
the
affordable
health
care
act
gives
states
and
private
insurers
important
roles
in
insuring
medical
care
for
those
who
need
it.
the
question
the
court
must
answer
is
whether
the
constitution
stops
congress
from
taking
the
course
it
did.
i
would
answer
emphatically
no.
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
congress'
power
to
tax
and
spend
supports
the
so-called
individual
mandate
or
minimum
coverage
provision,
but
i
would
make
that
an
auxiliary
holding.
as
i
see
it,
congress'
vast
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
solidly
undergirds
the
affordable
health
care
legislation.
i
would
uphold
the
legislation
first
and
foremost
on
that
ground.
since
1937,
this
court
has
deferred,
as
it
should,
to
congress'
policymaking
in
the
economic
and
social
realm.
today,
a
majority
of
the
court
rules
that
the
commerce
clause
is
not
equal
to
the
task.
that
ruling
harks
back
to
the
era
ended
75
years
ago
when
the
court
routinely
thwarted
legislative
efforts
to
regulate
the
economy
in
the
interest
of
those
who
labor
to
sustain
it.
it
is
a
stunning
setback.
it
should
not
have
staying
power.
the
court's
majority
would
compare
health
insurance
to
any
other
commodity,
broccoli
for
example.
if
the
government
can
compel
people
to
buy
insurance,
then
there
was
no
commodity.
the
government
can't
force
people
to
purchase,
so
the
argument
goes,
but
health
care
is
not
like
vegetables
or
other
items
one
is
at
liberty
to
buy
or
not
to
buy.
all
of
us
will
need
health
care,
some
sooner,
some
later,
but
we
can't
tell
when,
where
or
how
dire
our
need
will
be.
a
healthy
21-year-old,
for
example,
may
tomorrow
be
the
victim
of
an
accident
that
leaves
him
or
her
an
invalid,
in
need
of
constant
and
costly
medical
care.
further,
to
get
broccoli,
one
must
pay
at
the
counter,
not
so
of
health
care.
the
accident
victim
who
cannot
pay
the
steep
price
of
medical
services
will
nevertheless
receive
emergency
and
follow-up
care
because
the
law
and
professional
ethics
so
require
and
because
ours
is
a
humane
society,
but
people
who
do
purchase
insurance
end
up
footing
the
bill.
by
requiring
the
healthy
uninsured
either
to
obtain
insurance
or
pay
a
toll,
congress
sought
to
end
this
free
ride.
it
is
shortsighted
moreover
to
see
the
mandate
as
a
decree
that
the
hale
and
hearty
young
people
subsidize
care
rendered
to
older,
less
healthy
people.
in
the
fullness
of
time,
today's
young
and
healthy
will
become
society's
old
and
infirm.
viewed
over
a
lifespan,
the
cost
and
benefits
even
out.
and
as
i
just
observed,
the
youth
who
does
not
want
insurance
today
may
find
that
tomorrow
she
desperately
needs
the
services
insurance
is
designed
to
secure.
what
the
mandate
does
essentially
is
to
require
people
to
prepay
for
medical
care
to
insurance
instead
of
waiting,
expecting
to
pay
out-of-pocket
at
the
point
of
service
when
in
reality
many
will
lack
the
money
to
cover
the
cost.
the
chief
justice
reasons
that
congress
can
use
its
commerce
power
to
regulate
something
already
in
existence,
but
cannot
create
that
something
in
order
to
regulate
it.
but
the
interstate
health
insurance
and
health
care
markets
are
not
congress'
creations.
both
existed
well
before
the
enactment
of
the
affordable
healthcare
act.
i
have
already
emphasized
the
unique
attributes
of
the
health
care
market,
the
fact
that
all
of
us
will
be
in
it
sooner
or
later
and
cannot
predict
exactly
when
the
huge
free
ride,
a
problem
caused
by
people
who
refrain
from
purchasing
insurance
then
become
sick
or
injured
and
get
care
cost
free
to
them
but
costly
for
those
of
us
who
have
paid
in
advance.
because
there
is
no
comparable
market,
the
slippery
slope
envisioned
by
the
court's
majority,
if
health
insurance
today
then
broccoli
tomorrow,
is
far
more
imaginary
than
real.
as
a
learned
jurist
once
commented,
judges
and
lawyers
live
on
the
slippery
slope
of
analogies.
they
are
not
supposed
to
skid
to
the
bottom.
yes,
the
insurance
purchase
mandate
is
novel,
but
novelty
is
no
reason
to
reject
it.
as
our
economy
grows
and
changes,
congress
must
be
competent
to
devise
legislation
meeting
current
day
social
and
economic
realities.
for
that
reason,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
was
included
in
the
constitution
to
ensure
that
the
federal
government
would
have
the
capacity
to
provide
for
conditions
and
developments,
the
framers
knew
they
could
scarcely
foresee.
in
enacting
the
affordable
health
care
act,
congress'
aim
was
to
reduce
the
large
numbers
of
u.s.
residents,
some
50
million
in
2009,
who
lacked
health
insurance.
congress
was
aware
that
the
vast
majority
of
those
people
lack
insurance
not
by
choice.
one
group
of
particular
concern
to
congress
were
individuals
with
preexisting
medical
conditions.
before
the
affordable
health
care
act's
enactment,
the
insurance
industry
charged
these
individuals
steep
prices
or
flatly
denied
them
coverage.
congress
understood,
however,
that
a
simple
ban
on
those
practices
would
not
work
without
the
mandate
to
--
to
acquire
insurance
covering
those
with
preexisting
conditions
would
trigger
a
death
spiral
in
the
heath
insurance
market.
many
people
would
not
buy
insurance
until
they
suffered
sickness
or
injury,
premiums
would
skyrocket,
more
people
would
be
added
to
the
ranks
of
the
uninsured
because
they
could
not
pay
the
steep
premiums
and
eventually,
insurance
companies
left
with
a
pool
of
high
risk
policyholders
would
exit
the
market.
with
the
mandate,
the
job
could
be
done.
access
to
insurance
would
be
available
and
affordable
and
uncompensated
care
would
be
hugely
reduced.
in
no
way
was
congress'
action
improper.
the
mandate
acts
directly
on
individuals.
it
does
not
commandeer
the
states
as
intermediaries.
and
along
with
other
provisions
of
the
act,
it
addresses
the
sort
of
country-wide
problem
that
made
the
commerce
clause
essential.
the
crisis
created
by
the
many
millions
of
u.s.
residents
who
lack
health
insurance
is
hardly
contained
within
state
boundaries.
far
from
encroaching
on
state
prerogatives,
the
affordable
health
care
act
supplies
a
better
response
to
remedy
the
states
acting
separately
are
incapable
of
meeting.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
is
an
affirmative
power
commensurate
with
national
needs.
while
the
court
upholds
the
mandate,
as
it
surely
should,
it
also
regrettably
helms
in
congress'
commerce
power.
in
doing
so,
the
court
invites
assaults
on
national
legislation
irreconcilable
with
the
framers'
anticipation.
their
understanding
and
expectation
was
that
the
commerce
clause
would
empower
congress
to
act
in
all
cases
for
the
general
interest
of
the
union
and
also
in
those
instances
in
which
the
states
are
separately
incompetent.
my
dissent
from
the
court's
retrogressive
reading
of
the
commerce
clause
is
joined
by
justices
breyer,
sotomayor
and
kagan.
there
is
a
further
issue;
congress'
expansion
of
medicaid
to
include
a
larger
portion
of
the
nation's
poor.
medicaid
is
the
prototypical
example
of
federal-state
cooperation.
rather
than
authorizing
a
federal
agency
to
administer
a
uniform
national
health
care
system
for
the
poor,
as
congress
did
in
establishing
medicare
for
seniors,
congress
offered
states
the
opportunity
to
tailor
medicaid
grants
to
their
particular
needs
so
long
as
they
remain
within
bounds
set
by
the
federal
law.
congress
reserved
the
right
to
alter,
amend
or
repeal
any
and
every
provision
of
the
medicaid
act
and
participating
states
for
their
part
agreed
to
amend
their
medicaid
plans
consistent
with
alterations
in
the
federal
law.
from
1965
until
2010,
states
regularly
conformed
to
amendments
expanding
medicaid,
sometimes
quite
sizably.
the
2010
expansion
is
different
in
kind
the
court
concludes
7-to-2.
justice
sotomayor
and
i
strongly
disagree.
according
to
the
chief
justice,
the
expansion
was
misnamed.
it
did
not
expand
medicaid
as
it
existed
in
2010
he
maintains
instead
congress
established
a
wholly
new
program
alongside
old
medicaid
and
coerced
the
states
to
accept
new
medicaid
by
threatening
them
with
loss
of
funds
from
the
old
program
if
they
hold
out.
on
this
reasoning,
the
court,
for
the
first
time
ever,
finds
an
exercise
of
congress'
spending
power
unconstitutionally
coercive.
in
truth,
however,
medicaid
is
a
single
program
with
one
constant
aim
to
enable
poor
persons
to
receive
basic
health
care
when
they
need
it.
what
the
expansion
does
is
simply
this.
it
adds
more
people,
all
of
them
poor,
to
the
medicaid
eligible
population.
congress
did
not
otherwise
change
the
operation
of
the
program.
the
chief
justice
justifies
his
characterization
of
the
expansion
as
a
new
program
on
three
grounds.
first,
he
says,
by
covering
those
earning
up
to
133%
of
the
federal
poverty
line,
the
expansion,
unlike
medicaid
as
originality
enacted,
does
not
care
for
the
neediest
among
us.
the
expansion
covers
individuals
earning
less
than
$15,000
annually.
those
low
earners,
on
any
fair
assessment,
ranked
among
the
nation's
poor.
second,
the
chief
observes
that
newly
eligible
people
receive
a
level
of
coverage
less
comprehensive
than
the
traditional
medicaid
package.
but
the
affordable
health
care
act
did
not
introduce
the
less
comprehensive
package.
since
2006,
states
had
been
free
to
use
it
for
many
of
their
medicaid
beneficiaries.
third,
the
reimbursement
rate
for
participating
states
is
different.
true,
but
that
rate
is
markedly
more
generous
than
the
usual
federal
contribution,
hardly
something
the
states
can
complain
about.
the
federal
government
picks
up
100%
of
the
tab
initially
gradually
reducing
to
90%.
suppose
congress
had,
from
the
start,
made
medicaid
eligible
all
those
originally
covered
plus
those
added
by
the
expansion,
that
would
be
unobjectionable
under
the
chief
justice's
reasoning,
but
we
have
never
held
that
a
grant
program
becomes
two
rather
one
when
congress
lays
a
foundation
and
later
lose
on
it.
congress
can
and
often
does
expand
programs
adding
new
conditions
that
grant
recipients
must
meet
in
order
to
continue
receiving
funds.
our
decision,
i
acknowledge
--
our
decisions
have
hypothesized
that
a
financial
inducement
might
pass
the
point
where
a
pressure
becomes
coercion
and
therefore
exceed
congress'
spending
power,
but
until
today,
that
prospect
has
remained
theoretical.
the
court
had
found
no
case
fitting
the
bill.
recall
that
congress
reserved
to
itself,
when
it
adopted
medicaid
in
1965,
the
right
to
alter,
amend,
even
repeal
any
and
every
provision.
this
court
long
ago
explained
just
what
those
words
mean.
they
mean
congress
retains
full
and
complete
power
to
make
such
alterations
and
amendments
as
come
within
the
just
scope
of
the
legislative
power.
states
have
not
missed
that
meaning.
each
time
a
state
notified
the
federal
government
of
a
change
it
made
in
its
own
medicaid
plan,
it
certified
both
that
it
knew
the
federally
set
terms
of
participations
could
change
and
that
it
would
abide
by
the
changes
as
a
condition
of
continued
participation.
today's
decision
holds
that
congress
can
alter
a
spending
program
somewhat,
but
not
too
much.
we
can
anticipate
bolder
challenges
than
in
the
past
urging
that
a
congressional
amendment
goes
too
far
turning
pressure
into
compulsion.
when
those
challenges
arrive,
my
colleagues
may
comprehend
the
wisdom
of
the
observation
that
conceptions
of
impermissible
coercion
premised
on
a
state's
perceived
inability
to
decline
federal
funds
are
just
too
amorphous
to
be
judicially
administrable.
at
bottom,
my
colleagues'
position
is
that
the
states'
reliance
on
federal
funds
limits
congress'
authority
to
alter
its
spending
programs.
this
gets
things
backward.
congress,
not
the
states,
is
tasked
by
the
constitution
with
spending
federal
money
in
service
of
their
general
welfare
and
each
successive
congress
is
empowered
to
appropriate
funds
as
it
sees
fit.
when
the
111th
congress
reached
a
conclusion
about
the
portion
of
the
nation's
poor
that
should
qualify
for
medicaid
apportioned
larger
than
a
predecessor
congress
covered,
the
later
congress
abridged
no
states'
right
to
existing
or
preexisting
funds
for
in
truth
there
are
no
such
funds.
it
is
only
money
the
states
anticipate
receiving,
but
can
scarcely
insist
on
receiving
from
future
congresses.
seven
members
of
the
court,
however,
buy
the
argument
that
prospective
withholding
of
anticipated
funds
exceeds
congress'
spending
power.
given
that
holding,
i
entirely
agree
with
the
chief
justice
as
to
the
appropriate
remedy.
it
is
to
bar
the
withholding
found
impermissible
not
to
scrap
the
expansion
altogether.
this
court
has
many
times
explained
that
when
it
confirms
a
statute
marred
by
a
constitutional
infirmity,
its
endeavor
must
be
to
salvage,
not
demolish
the
legislation.
the
court
does
that
by
declaring
the
statute
invalid
to
the
extent
it
reaches
too
far,
but
otherwise
leaving
the
statute
intact.
because
the
court
finds
the
withholding,
not
the
granting
of
federal
funds,
incompatible
with
the
spending
clause,
congress'
extension
of
medicaid
remains
available
to
any
state
affirming
its
willingness
to
accept
the
uncommonly
generous
federal
grant.
so,
in
the
end,
the
affordable
health
care
act
survives
largely
unscathed,
but
the
court's
commerce
and
spending

jurisprudence
has
been
set
array.
my
expectation
is
that
the
setbacks
will
be
temporary
glyphs,
not
permanent
obstructions.
