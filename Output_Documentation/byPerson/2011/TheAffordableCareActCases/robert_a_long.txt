mr.
robert
a.
long
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
anti-injunction
act
imposes
a
pay
first,
litigate
later
rule
that
is
central
to
federal
tax
assessment
and
collection.
the
act
applies
to
essentially
every
tax
penalty
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
made
a
special
exception
for
the
penalty
imposed
by
section
5000a.
on
the
contrary,
there
are
three
reasons
to
conclude
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies
here.
first,
congress
directed
that
the
section
5000a
penalty
shall
be
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
taxes.
second,
congress
provided
that
penalties
are
included
in
taxes
for
assessment
purposes.
and
third,
the
section
5000a
penalty
bears
the
key
indicia
of
a
tax.
congress
directed
that
the
section
5000a
penalty
shall
be
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
taxes.
that
derivative
triggers
the
anti-injunction
act
which
provides
that
"no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax
may
be
maintained
in
any
court
by
any
person.
"
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
i
think
i
have
a
three-part
answer
to
that,
justice
scalia.
first,
the
text
does
not
say
that
the
secretary
shall
assess
and
collect
taxes
in
the
same
manner;
it
just
says
that
it
shall
be
assessed
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax,
without
addressing
any
party
particularly.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
the
assessment
--
the
other
two
parts
of
the
answer
are,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
in
this
case
that
if
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply,
this
penalty,
the
section
5000a
penalty,
will
as
a
practical
matter
be
assessed
and
collected
in
a
very
different
manner
from
other
taxes
and
other
tax
penalties.
there
--
there
are
three
main
differences.
first,
when
the
anti-injunction
act
applies,
you
have
to
pay
the
tax
or
the
penalty
first
and
then
litigate
later
to
get
it
back
with
interest.
second,
you
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies;
even
after
you
pay
the
tax
you
can't
immediately
go
to
court.
you
have
to
go
to
the
secretary
and
give
the
secretary
at
least
6
months
to
see
if
the
matter
can
be
resolved
administratively.
and
third,
even
in
the
very
carefully
defined
situations
in
which
congress
has
permitted
a
challenge
to
a
tax
or
a
penalty
before
it's
paid,
the
secretary
has
to
make
the
first
move.
the
taxpayer
is
never
allowed
to
rush
into
court
before
the
tax
--
before
the
secretary
sends
a
notice
of
deficiency
to
start
the
process.
now
if
--
if
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply
here,
none
of
those
rules
apply.
that's
not
just
for
this
case;
it
will
be
for
every
challenge
to
a
section
5000a
penalty
going
forward.
the
--
the
taxpayer
will
be
able
to
go
to
court
at
any
time
without
exhausting
administrative
remedies;
there
will
be
none
of
the
limitations
that
apply
in
terms
of
you
have
to
wait
for
the
secretary
to
make
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
because
if
the
anti-injunction
act
doesn't
apply
there
is
--
there
is
no
prohibition
on
courts
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
this
penalty,
and
you
can
simply--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
in
--
you
could
do
that,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
--
of
common
law
or
judicially
imposed
doctrine,
but
in
the
code
itself
which
is
all
--
i
mean,
the
anti-injunction
act
is
an
absolutely
central
statute
to
litigation--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--about
taxes.
and
the
code
says,
first
it
says
you
must
pay
the
tax
first
and
then
litigate.
so
that's
the
baseline.
and
then
in
addition
it
says
you
must
--
i
mean,
it's
not
common
law;
it's
in
the
code
--
you
must
apply
for
a
refund,
you
must
wait
at
least
6
months.
that's
--
many
of
these
provisions
are
extremely
specific,
with
very
specific
time
limits--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
helvering
v.
davis
was
decided
during
a
period
when
this
court
interpreted
the
anti-injunction
act
as
simply
codifying
the
pre-statutory
equitable
principles
that
usually
but
not
always
prohibited
a
court
from
enjoining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
taxes.
so
that
understanding,
which
is
what
was
the
basis
for
the
helvering
v.
davis
decision,
was
rejected
by
the
court
in
williams
packing
and
a
series
of
subsequent
cases
--
bob
jones.
and
so
i
would
say
effectively,
the
davis
case
has
been
overruled
by
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long
right.
well,
i
mean,
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
the
tax
injunction
act
was
based
on
the
anti-injunction
act.
you
are
quite
right,
the
language
is
different;
but
we
submit
that
the
anti-injunction
act
itself,
by
saying
that
no
suit
shall
be
maintained,
is
--
is
addressed
to
courts
as
well
as
litigants.
i
mean,
after
all,
a
case
cannot
go
from
beginning
to
end
without
the
active
cooperation
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
it's
--
i
mean
--
perhaps
a
party
could
initiate
an
action
without
the
act
of
cooperation
of
the
court,
but
to
maintain
it
from
beginning
to
end
again
requires
the
court's
cooperation.
and
--
and
even
if
--
i
mean,
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
say
as
an
initial
matter
if
this
statute
were
coming
before
us
for
the
first
time
today,
given
all
of
your
recent
decisions
on
jurisdiction,
that
you
might
be
inclined
to
say
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute.
a
lot
of
water
has
gone
over
the
dam
here.
the
court
has
said
multiple
times
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
statute.
congress
has
not
disturbed
those
decisions.
to
the
contrary--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--there
--
there
are
certainly
a
number
of
cases
where
the
court
dismissed
saying
it
is
jurisdictional.
as
i
read
the
cases,
i
don't
think
any
of
them
would
necessarily
have
come
out
differently,
because
i
don't
think
we
had
a
case
where
the
argument
was,
well,
you
know,
the
government
has
waived
this,
so,
you
know,
even
--
if
it's
not
jurisdictional--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--no.
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
best
interpretation
of
the
court's
cases
is
that
it
was
interpreting
a
jurisdictional
statute.
and,
indeed,
in
williams
packing,
the
court
said
it
was
a
jurisdictional
statute.
but,
again,
even
if
you
have
doubt
about
simply
the
cases,
there
is
more
than
that
because
congress
has
--
has
not
only
not
disturbed
this
court's
decision
stating
that
the
statute
is
jurisdictional,
they've
passed
numerous
amendments
to
this
anti-injunction
act.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
what
you
have
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
has
been
absolutely
consistent
for
50
years,
since
the
williams
packing
case.
the
period
of
inconsistency
was
after
the
first
50
years,
since
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1867.
and
there
was
a
period,
as
i
said,
when
the
court
was
allowing
extraordinary
circumstances
exceptions
and
equitable
exceptions,
but
then,
very
quickly,
it
cut
back
on
that.
and
since
--
and
since
williams
packing,
you
have
been
utterly
consistent--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
again,
i
mean,
i
think
the
best
understanding
of
south
carolina
v.
regan
is
not
that
its
an
equitable
exception,
but
it's
the
court
interpreting
a
jurisdictional
statute
as
it
would
interpret
any
statute
in
light
of
its
purpose,
and
deciding
in
that
very
special
case,
it's
a
very
narrow
exception,
where
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--no.
no,
justice
sotomayor,
because
in
many
of
these
amendments
which
have
come
in
the
'70s
and
the
'90s
and
the
2000's,
congress
has
actually
framed
the
limited
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
act
in
jurisdictional
terms.
and
it's
written
many
of
the
express
exceptions
by
saying
notwithstanding
section
7421--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
but
congress
says,
notwithstanding
7421,
the
court
"shall
have
jurisdiction
to
restrain
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes
in
very
limited--
"
mr.
robert
a.
long
--right.
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
you
would
be
saying
that
for
the
refund
statute,
as
well
as
for
the
anti-injunction
act
--
which
has
very
similar
wording,
so
if
the
anti-injunction
act
is
not
jurisdictional,
i
think
that's
also
going
to
apply
to
the
refund
statute,
the
statute
that
says
you
have
to
first
ask
for
a
refund
and
then
file,
you
know,
within
certain
time
--
so
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
both
of
those
statutes.
and,
you
know,
we
are
dealing
with
taxes
here,
if
people--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
a.
long
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--that
would
certainly
be
the
first
class
of
cases,
it
occurs
to
me,
where,
if
the
government
does
not
raise
it
in
a
timely
way,
it
could
be
waived.
i
would
think
plaintiffs
would
see
if
there
was
some
clever
way
they
could
get
a
suit
going
that
wouldn't
immediately
be
apparent
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
and,
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
honestly,
i
can't
predict
what
would
happen,
but
i
would
say
that
not
all
people
who
litigate
about
federal
taxes
are
necessarily
rational.
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
great--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
i
mean,
the
first
point
is
--
our
initial
submission
is
you
don't
have
to
determine
that
this
is
a
tax
in
order
to
find
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies,
because
congress
very
specifically
said
that
it
shall
be
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax,
even
if
it's
a
tax
penalty
and
not
a
tax.
so
that's
one--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--so
specifically
on
the
argument
that
it
--
it
is
actually
a
tax,
even
setting
aside
the
point
that
it
should
be
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax.
the
anti-injunction
act
uses
the
term
"tax";
it
doesn't
define
it.
somewhat
to
my
surprise,
"tax"
is
not
defined
anywhere
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
in
about
the
time
that
congress
passed
the
anti-injunction
act,
tax
had
a
very
broad
definition.
it's
broad
enough
to
include
this
exaction,
which
is
codified
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
it's
part
of
the
taxpayers'
annual
income
tax
return.
the
amount
of
the
liability
and
whether
you
owe
the
liability
is
based
in
part
on
your
income.
it's
assessed
and
collected
by
the
irs.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
i
mean,
the
anti-injunction
act
applies
not
only
to
every
tax
in
the
code,
but,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
to
every
tax
penalty
in
the
code.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
in
--
in
bob
jones
the
court
said
that
they
had
gotten
out
of
the
business
of
trying
to
determine
whether
an
exaction
is
primarily
revenue
raising
or
primarily
regulatory.
and
this
one
certainly
raises
--
is
expected
to
raise
very
substantial
amounts
of
revenues,
at
least
$4
billion
a
year
by
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--that's--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--that's
--
that's
absolutely
right,
and
that's
obviously
why,
if
it
were
called
a
tax,
there
would
be
absolutely
no
question
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies.
mr.
robert
a.
long
yes,
that's
--
it
does,
that
is
correct,
and
there
are
many
other
places
in
the
code
where--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
i
mean,
there
are
penalties
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
you
really
couldn't
say
are
related
in
any
--
in
any
close
way
to
some
other
tax
provision.
there
is
a
penalty
--
it's
discussed
in
the
briefs
--
for
selling
diesel
fuel
that
doesn't
comply
with
epa's
regulations,
you
know.
so
there
are
all
kinds
of
penalties
in
the
code,
and
i
think
it's
--
it
could
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
i
mean,
congress
didn't
use
the
language
the
anti-injunction
act
shall
apply--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
right,
all
of
subtitle
f,
which
picks
up
lots
of
administration
and
procedure
provisions,
but
those
--
those
are
fees,
and
they
are
not
--
congress
did
not
provide,
you
know,
in
the
sections
themselves
that
they
should
be
paid
as
part
of
a
tax
return.
so
they
were
free-standing
fees,
and
by
using
that
subtitle
f
language,
congress
plugged
in
a
whole
set
of
rules
for
how
to
collect
and
administer
the
fees,
and
it
went
not
just
to
assessment
and
collection
--
and
the
irs
has
recognized
this
--
but
to
examination,
privacy,
a
whole
series
of
additional
things.
so
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
look
at
that
language
and
say,
"oh,
here's
congress
saying
they
want
the
anti-injunction
act
to
apply.
"
they
are
actually
doing
more
than
that.
and,
yes,
i
grant
you,
you
could
look
at
section
5000a,
the
individual
coverage
requirement,
and
say,
well,
they
could
have
been
clearer
about
saying
the
anti-injunction
act
applied,
and
that's
certainly
true,
but,
again,
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
a
lot.
maybe--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--it
does
strike
me,
honestly,
as
a
bit
unusual,
but
this
is
an
old
statute.
i
mean,
this
--
the
core
language
is
essentially
unchanged
since
1867,
and,
you
know,
i
think
that's
part
of
the
explanation
for
it.
and,
again,
it's,
you
know,
become
the
center
of
a
series
of
provisions
that
very
carefully
control
the
circumstances
in
which
litigation
about
federal
taxes
can
take
place.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
i
think
that
argument
doesn't
work
for
two
reasons.
i
mean,
first,
if
you
look
at
the
plaintiff's
own
complaint,
they
clearly
challenge
both
the
minimum
coverage
requirement
and
the
penalty.
at
page
122
of
the
joint
appendix
they
challenge
the
requirement
that
the
individuals
obtain
health
care
coverage
or
pay
a
penalty.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
yes,
i
mean,
it's
--
or
another
complaint
would
be
filed,
but,
still,
i
think
that's
a
serious
problem.
but
even
if
they
had
filed
a
different
complaint,
i
don't
think
you
--
in
this
case
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
the
minimum
coverage
requirement
from
the
penalty
because
the
penalty
is
the
sole
means
of
enforcing
the
minimum
coverage
requirement.
so
--
so,
first,
i
mean,
i
think
these
plaintiffs
would
not
be
satisfied
if
the
court
were
to
render
a
judgment
saying
the
minimum
coverage
requirement
is
invalidated;
the
penalty,
however,
remains
standing.
anybody
who
doesn't
have
insurance
has
to
pay
the
penalty.
then
they
would
have
to
pay
a
penalty
equal
to
the
cost
of
insurance
and
they
wouldn't
even
have
insurance.
so
i
don't
think
that
would
be--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
i
mean,
first
of
all,
i
can't
find
that
in
the
record,
in
their
declarations.
i
don't
see
a
statement
that
they
will,
you
know,
never
incur
a
penalty
under
any
circumstances.
but
--
but
even
if
that
were
so,
what
this
court
has
said
in
americans
united
is
the
anti-injunction
act
bars
any
suit,
not
just
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
your
own
taxes,
but
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
anyone's
taxes.
and
so
even
if
it
were
really
true
that
these
plaintiffs
were
not
interested
in
the
penalty
and
would
never
pay
the
penalty,
if
they
were
to
succeed
in
this
case
in
striking
down
the
minimum
coverage
requirement
the
inevitable
result
would
be
that
the
penalty
would
fall
as
well,
because
the
government
couldn't
collect
the
penalty
for
failing
to
follow
an
unconstitutional
requirement,
and
so
it
would
still
be
barred
because
it
would
be
a
suit
that
would
prevent
the
collection
of
some
of
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well
--
--
well,
i
mean,
this
court
in
the
bob
jones
case,
where
a
similar
kind
of
argument
was
being
made
by
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
said:
look,
you
know,
where
the
--
where
it's
inevitable
that
this
is
what
the
suit
is
about,
they're
sort
of
two
sides
of
the
same
coin,
that
clearly
is
a
primary
purpose
of
the
suit.
and
it's
--
and
you
can't
by
clever
pleading
get
away
from
that.
that's
just
the
nature
of
the
situation.
mr.
robert
a.
long
well,
i
would
not
argue
that
this
statute
is
a
perfect
model
of
clarity,
but
i
do
think
the
most
reasonable
way
to
read
the
entire
statute
is
that
it
does
impose
a
single
obligation
to
pay
a
penalty
if
you
are
an
applicable
individual
and
you
are
not
subject
to
an
exemption.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
if
you
look
at
the
exemptions
from
the
penalty,
the
very
first
one
is
you
are
exempt
from
the
penalty
because
you
can't
afford
to
purchase
insurance.
and
it
just
doesn't
seem
reasonable
to
me
to
interpret
the
statute
as
congress
having
said,
well,
you
know,
this
person
is
exempt
from
paying
a
penalty
because
we
find
they
can't
afford
to
buy
insurance,
however
they
still
have
a
legal
obligation
to
buy
insurance.
that
just
doesn't
seem
reasonable.
so
i
--
so
i
do
think,
although
it's
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
argue
it's
clear
--
that
that's
the
best
way
to
understand
the
statute
as
a
whole.
but
again,
i
would
say,
you
know,
that's
not
essential
to
the
question
we're
discussing
now
of
whether
the
anti-injunction
act
applies.
again,
you
know,
i
think--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--well,
in
going
back
to
--
so
if
the
result
were
to
say
simply,
this
is
not
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
solicitor
general's
reading.
so
now
it's
not--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--right.
well,
i
mean,
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
reading
would
probably
create
the
fewest
problems,
as
i
understand
it.
i
mean,
my
--
my
main
objection
to
the
solicitor
general's
reading
is
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
i
mean,
basically
the
solicitor
general
says
every
penalty
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
every
other
penalty
in
the
affordable
care
act
is--
mr.
robert
a.
long
--right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
right.
mr.
robert
a.
long
i
think
my
--
my
take
on
it
is
if
you
adopted
the
solicitor
general's
approach
there
are
probably
three
penalties
for
alcohol
and
tobacco-related
offenses
at
5114(c),
5684,
and
5761
that
i
think
would
be
very
difficult
to
distinguish
from
this
one,
and
possibly
the
527(j)
penalty
for
failure
to
disclose
political
contributions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
long
everyone
agrees
that
the
section
5000a
penalty
shall
be
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
taxes.
and
the
parties'
principal
argument
why
that
does
not
make
the
anti-injunction
act
applicable
is
that,
well,
that
simply
goes
to
the
secretary's
activities.
and
i
would
simply
ask,
if
--
if
you
look
at
chapters
63
and
64
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
are
the
chapters
on
assessment
and
collection,
they
are
not
just
addressed
to
the
secretary.
there
are
many
provisions
in
there
that
are
addressed
to
courts
and
indeed
talk
about
this
interaction,
the
very
limited
situations
in
which
courts
are
permitted
to
restrain
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes.
there
was
a
statement
made
that
there
aren't
--
and
many
of
the
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
act
are
in
the
assessment
and
collection
provisions
--
there
was
a
statement
made
that
none
of
these
directly
confer
jurisdiction
to
restrain
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes.
that's
not
true.
in
footnote
11
of
our
opening
brief,
we
cite
several.
i'll
simply
mention
section
6213
as
an
example.
that
says
--
i
quote:
"notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
7421(a),
the
making
of
such
assessment
or
the
beginning
of
such
proceeding
or
levy
during
the
time
that
such
prohibition
is
enforced,
may
be
enjoined
by
a
proceeding
in
the
proper
court,
including
the
tax
court.
"
"the
tax
court
shall
have
no
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
any
action
or
proceeding
or
order
any
refund
under
this
subsection
unless
a
timely
petition
for
redetermination
of
the
deficiency
has
been
filed,
and
then
only
in
respect
of
the
deficiency
that
is
the
subject
of
such
petition.
"
mr.
robert
a.
long
i
mean,
i
think
i'm
following
you,
but
--
but
the
fact
that
it's
not
in
the
particular
subchapter
for
assessable
penalties
in
my
view
makes
no
difference,
because
they
said
it's
still
clearly
--
it's
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
the
penalty
in
that
subchapter,
and
those
penalties
are
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
taxes.
mr.
robert
a.
long
and
so
that's
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
rather
detailed,
but
i
think
it's
a
rather
clear
indication
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies.
the
--
the
refund
statute
that
does
specifically
refer
to
penalties,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
argument
that
it's
assessed
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
a
tax.
that
would
simply
go
to
the
point
that
well,
you
can't
just
call
it
a
tax,
because
they've
referred
to
it
as
a
penalty.
and
finally,
on
jurisdiction,
you
know,
i
think
the
key
point
is
we
have
a
long
line
of
this
court's
decisions
that's
really
been
ratified
by
congress
with
all
these
exceptions
in
jurisdictional
terms.
as
i
read
bowles
and
john
r.
sand
&
gravel,
the
--
the
gist
of
these
decisions
was
not
any
special
sort
of
rule
about
appeals,
it's
that
when
we
have
that
situation,
which
i
would
submit
applies
as
much
to
federal
taxes
as
it
does
to
appeals
from
federal
district
courts
when
we
have
this
degree
of
--
of
precedent,
including
precedent
from
congress
in
the
form
of
amendments
to
this
anti-injunction
act,
that
should
be
--
the
presumption
should
be
that
this
is
jurisdictional.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
robert
a.
long
thank
you.
