mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i
would
just
like
to
say,
i
think
that
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
the
community-rating
and
guaranteed-issue
provisions
ought
to
be
struck
down
is
an
example
of
the
best
driving
out
the
good;
because,
even
without
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
those
two
provisions,
guaranteed-issue
and
community-rating,
will
still
open
insurance
markets
to
millions
of
people
that
were
excluded
under
the
prior
system,
and
for
millions
of
people
will
lower
prices,
which
were
raised
high
under
the
old
system
because
of
their
poor
health.
so
even
though
the
system
is
not
going
to
work
precisely
as
congress
wanted,
it
would
certainly
serve
central
goals
that
congress
had
of
expanding
coverage
for
people
who
were
unable
to
get
coverage
or
unable
to
get
it
at
affordable
prices.
so
when
the
government--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
when
we
talk
about
premiums
becoming
less
affordable,
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
different
groups
of
people,
because
it
is
not
something
that
applies
accurately
to
everybody.
for
people
who
were
not
able
to
get
insurance
before,
obviously,
their
insurance
beforehand
was
--
the
price
was
essentially
infinite.
they
were
not
able
to
get
it
at
any
price.
they
will
now
be
able
to
get
it
at
a
price
that
they
can
afford.
for
people
who
are
unhealthy
and
were
able
to
get
insurance,
but
perhaps
not
for
the
things
that
they
were
most
concerned
about,
or
only
at
very
high
rates,
their
rates
will
be
lower
under
the
system,
even
without
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
also,
you
have
a
large
number
of
people
who,
under
the
act--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--because--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--their
rates
are
going
to
be
lower
than
they
were
under
the
prior
system
because
they
are
going
into
a
pool
of
people,
rather
than
--
some
of
whom
are
healthy,
rather
than
having
their
rates
set
according
to
their
individual
health
characteristics.
that's
why
their
rates
were
so
high.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--certainly.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
a
moment,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
finding;
but,
if
i
could
just
postpone
that
for
a
second
and
talk
about
adverse
selection
itself.
i
think
one
of
the
misconceptions
here,
justice
kagan,
is
that
congress,
having
seen
the
experience
of
the
states
in
the
'90s
with
community-rating
and
guaranteed-issue,
simply
imposed
the
minimum
coverage
provision
as
a
possible
way
of
dealing
with
that;
and,
if
you
don't
have
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
then,
essentially,
adverse
selection
runs
rampant.
but
that's
not
what
happened.
congress
included
at
least
half
a
dozen
other
provisions
to
deal
with
adverse
selection
caused
by
bringing
in
people
who
are
less
healthy
into
the
act.
there
are
--
to
begin
with,
the
act
authorizes
annual
enrollment
periods,
so
people
can't
just
show
up
at
the
hospital.
if
they
don't
show
up
and
sign
up
at
the
right
time,
they
at
least
have
to
wait
until
the
time
next
year.
that's
authorized
by
the
act.
there
--
with
respect
to
the
subsidies,
there
are
three
different
things
that
make
this
important.
first
of
all,
the
subsidies
are
very
generous.
for
people
below
200
percent
of
the
federal
poverty
line,
the
subsidy
will
cover
80
percent,
on
average,
of
the
premium
which
makes
it
attractive
to
them
to
join.
the
structure
of
the
subsidies,
because
their
income
--
they
create
a
floor
for
--
based
on
the
income
of
the
person
getting
the
insurance,
and
then
the
government
covers
everything
over
that.
and
this
is
important
in
adverse
selection
because
if
you
do
have
a
change
in
the
mix
of
people,
and
average
premiums
start
to
rise,
the
government
picks
up
the
increase
in
the
premium.
the
amount
that
the
person
who
is
getting
insured
contributes
remains
constant
at
a
percentage
of
his
or
her
income.
and
the
third
thing--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
mean,
that's
a
fair
point,
justice
scalia;
although,
one
of
the
things
that
happens,
if
you
take
the
mandate
out,
while
it
is
true
that
the
subsidies
that
the
government
provides
to
any
individual
will
increase,
and
they
will
be
less
efficient
--
i'm
not
disputing
that
point
--
actually
the
overall
amount
of
the
subsidies
that
the
government
will
provide
will
decline,
as
the
government
notes
itself
in
its
brief,
because
there
will
be
fewer
people
getting
them.
some
people
will
opt
out
of
the
system
even
though
they
are
getting
subsidies.
but
i
would
just
like
to
go
back
for
one
more
second
to
the
point
about
how
the
subsidies
are
part
of
what
congress
was
using,
because
the
other
thing
is
that
for
people
below
250
percent
of
the
federal
poverty
line
congress
also
picks
up
and
subsidizes
the
out-of-pocket
costs,
raising
the
actuarial
value.
so
you
have
all
of
that,
and
then
you
have
congress
also,
unlike
the
states
establishing
--
or
i
should
be
precisely
accurate
--
almost
all
the
states,
establishing
an
age
differential
of
up
to
three
to
one.
so
an
insurance
company,
for
example,
that
is
selling
a
25-year-old
a
policy
for
$4,000
can
charge
a
60-year-old
$12,000
for
exactly
the
same
coverage.
the
states
typically
in
the
90s
when
they
were
instituting
these
programs,
they
either
had
pure
community
rating,
where
everybody
is
charged
the
same
premium,
everybody
regardless
of
their
age
is
charged
the
same
premium.
some
states
had
a
variance
of
1.5
to
1.
massachusetts,
for
example,
which
did
have
good
subsidies,
but
their
age
band
was
two
to
one.
so
when
congress
is
enacting
this
act,
it's
not
simply
looking
at
the
states
and
thinking:
well,
that
didn't
go
very
well;
why
don't
we
put
in
a
minimum
coverage
provision;
that
will
solve
the
problem.
congress
did
a
lot
of
different
things
to
try
to
combat
the
adverse
selection.
now,
if
i
could
turn
to
the
finding,
because
i
think
this
is
the
crux
of
the
government's
position
and
then
the
plaintiffs
pick
up
on
that,
and
then
move
--
move
from
that
to
the
rest
of
the
act.
and
it
seems
to
me,
quite
honestly,
it's
an
important
part
because
that
is
textual.
in
this
whole
sort
of
quest
for
what
we
are
trying
to
figure
out,
the
finding
seems
to
stand
out
as
something
that
the
court
could
rely
on
and
say
here's
something
congress
has
actually
told
us.
but
i
think
the
real
problem
with
the
finding
is
the
context
in
which
congress
made
it.
it's
quite
clear.
if
the
court
wants
to
look,
the
finding
is
on
page
42
--
43a,
excuse
me,
of
the
solicitor
general's
severability
brief
in
the
appendix.
but
the
finding
is
made
specifically
in
the
context
of
interstate
commerce.
that
is
why
the
findings
are
in
the
act
at
all.
congress
wanted
to
indicate
to
the
court,
knowing
that
the
minimum
coverage
provision
was
going
to
be
challenged,
wanted
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
basis
on
which
it
believed
it
had
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
this
law.
why
does
that
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
finding
i,
which
is
the
one
that
the
government
is
relying
on,
and
in
particular
the
last
sentence,
which
says
"this
requirement
is
essential
to
creating
effective
health
insurance
markets
in
which
guaranteed-issue
and
preexisting
illnesses
can
be
covered.
"
the
reason
is
because
the
word
"essential"
in
the
commerce
clause
context
doesn't
have
the
colloquial
meaning.
in
the
commerce
clause
context
"essential"
effectively
means
useful.
so
that
when
one
says
in
lopez,
when
the
court
says
section
922(q)
is
not
an
essential
part
of
a
larger
regulatory
scheme
of
economic
activity,
it
goes
on
to
say,
in
which
the
regulatory
scheme
would
be
undercut
if
we
didn't
have
this
provision.
well,
if
that's
all
congress
means,
i
agree
with
that.
the
system
will
be
undercut
somewhat
if
you
don't
have
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
it's
like
the
word
"necessary"
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
clause.
it
doesn't
mean,
as
the
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions,
absolutely
necessary.
it
means
conducive
to,
useful,
advancing
the
objectives,
advancing
the
aims.
and
it's
easy
to
see,
i
think,
that
that's
what
congress--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
but
i
think
my
point,
justice
scalia,
is
that
they
are
not
using
it
in
the
true
dictionary
sense.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
there
are
several
reasons
that
i
would
suggest
that
we
would
know
that
from.
the
first
is,
as
i
say,
the
findings
themselves.
congress
says
at
the
very
beginning,
the
head
of
it,
is
congress
makes
the
following
findings,
and
they
are
talking
about
the
interstate
--
you
know,
b
is
headed
"effects
on
the
national
economy
and
interstate
commerce.
"
so
we
know
the
context
that
congress
is
talking
about.
it
is
more
or
less
quoting
from
the
court's
commerce
clause
statements.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
very
preceding
finding,
which
is
finding
h,
which
is
on
42
over
onto
43,
congress
at
that
point
also
uses
the
word
"essential".
in
the
second
sentence
it
says
"this
requirement"
--
and
again
we're
talking
about
the
minimum
coverage
provision
--
is
an
essential
part
of
this
larger
regulation
of
economic
activity,
which
is,
by
the
way,
an
exact
quote
from
lopez,
in
which
"the
absence
of
the
requirement
undercuts
federal
regulation.
"
also
an
exact
quote
from
lopez.
but
what
it
is
referring
to
is
an
essential
--
an
essential
part
of
erisa,
the
national
health
service
act
and
the
affordable
care
act.
it
can't
possibly
be,
even
the
plaintiffs
haven't
argued,
that
those
acts
would
all
fall
in
their
entirety
if
you
took
out
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
and
as
a
second
example
of
the
same
usage
by
congress,
the
statute
that
was
before
the
court
in
raich,
section
801
of
title
21,
the
court
said
that
the
regulation
of
intrastate
drug
activity,
drug
traffic,
was
essential
to
the
regulation
of
interstate
drug
activity.
again,
it
is
simply
not
conceivable
that
congress
was
saying
one
is
so
indispensable
to
the
other,
the
way
the
united
states
uses
the
term
here,
so
indispensable
that
if
we
can't
regulate
the
intrastate
traffic
we
don't
want
to
regulate
the
interstate
traffic,
either.
the
whole
law
criminalizing
drug
traffic
would
fall.
so
i
think
once
you
look
at
the
finding
for
what
i
believe
it
says,
which
is
we
believe
this
is
a
useful
part
of
our
regulatory
scheme,
which
the
congress
would
think
in
its
own
approach
would
be
sufficient--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i
think
that's
a
fair
question.
but
the
idea
that
--
that
all
the
information
before
congress
only
led
to
the
idea
that
you
would
have
death
spirals
seems
to
me
to
be
contradicted
a
little
bit
at
least
by
the
cbo
report
in
november
of
2009,
which
is
about
4
months
before
the
act
passed,
where
the
cbo
talks
about
adverse
selection.
now,
i
want
to
be
clear.
this
is
at
a
time
when
the
minimum
coverage
provision
was
in
the
statute,
so
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
a
discussion
without
that
in
it.
but
nonetheless,
the
cbo
goes
through
and
talks
about
adverse
selection,
and
points
out
the
different
provisions
in
the
act,
the
ones
i
have
mentioned
plus
one
other,
actually,
where
in
the
first
3
years
of
the
operation
of
the
exchanges
those
insurance
companies
that
get
sort
of
a
worse
selection
of
consumers
will
be
given
essentially
credits
from
insurance
companies
that
get
better
selections.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
doesn't
sound
right
the
way
you
say
it,
justice
kennedy.
no,
i--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
now,
i
agree
that
there
is
a
risk
and
the
significance
of
it
people
can
debate.
but
what
i
think
is
--
is
lost
in
that
question,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
be
whimsical
about
it,
i
think
what
is
lost
in
it
a
little
bit
is
what
is
on
the
other
side,
which
is
the
fact
that
if
you
follow
the
government's
suggestion,
if
the
court
follows
the
government's
suggestion,
what
is
going
to
be
lost
is
something
we
know
is
a
central
part
of
the
act.
i
mean,
indeed,
if
one
sort
of
looks
at
the
legislative
history
more
broadly,
i
think
much
of
it
is
directed
toward
the
idea
that
guaranteed
--
issue
and
community
rating
were
the
crown
jewel
of
the
act.
the
minimum
coverage
provision
wasn't
something
that
everybody
was
bragging
about,
it
was
something
that
was
meant
to
be
part
of
this
package.
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
--
the
point
of
it
was
to
have
guaranteed-issue
and
minimum
coverage
--
i
mean,
excuse
me
--
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating.
and
that's
--
under
the
government's
proposal,
those
would
--
would
disappear.
we
would
go
back
to
the
old
system.
and
under
what
i
think
is
the
proper
severability
analysis,
the
--
the
real
question
the
court
is
asking,
should
be
asking,
is,
would
congress
rather
go
back
to
the
old
system
than
to
take
perhaps
the
risk
that
you're
talking
about,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
the
court
adopts
the
position
that
i'm
advocating,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
what
would
happen
is
that
the
court
would
say
that
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
by
hypothesis
of
course,
is
unconstitutional,
and
the
fact
of
that
being
unconstitutional
does
not
mean
the
invalidation
of
any
other
provision.
so
under
the
position
i'm
advocating,
there
would
no
longer
be
challenges
to
the
remaining
part
of
the
act.
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--you
--
if
the
court
follows
the
course
that
i'm
advocating,
you
do
not
bring
an
action
in
court,
you
go
to
congress
and
you
seek
a
change
from
congress
to
say
the
minimum
coverage
provision
has
been
struck
down
by
the
court,
here
is
our
--
here
--
here's
the
information
that
we
have
to
show
you
what
the
risks
are
going
to
be.
here
are
the
adjustments
you
need
to
make.
one
of
the
questions
earlier
pointed
out
that
states
have
adjusted
their
systems
as
they've
gone
along,
as
they've
seen
things
work
or
not
work.
you
know,
as
i
was
talking
earlier
about
the
--
the
different
ratio
for
--
for
ages
and
insurance.
the
states
have
tended
to
change
that,
because
they've
found
that
having
too
narrow
a
band
worked
against
the
effectiveness
of
--
of
their
programs.
but
they
did
--
except
for
in
massachusetts,
they
didn't
enact
mandates.
so
to
answer
--
i
think
to
answer
your
question
directly,
<mister>
[=
mr.]
chief
justice,
the
position
i'm
advocating
would
simply
have
those
--
those
pleas
go
to
congress,
not
in
court.
now,
if
one
--
just
--
just
to
discuss
the
issue
more
generally,
if
that's
helpful,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
if
there
were
situations
where
the
court
deferred
--
let's
say
for
discretionary
reasons,
they
just
said
--
the
court
said
we're
--
we're
not
going
to
take
up
the
question
of
severability
and
therefore
not
resolve
it
in
these
other
situations,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
in
enforcement
actions,
for
example,
if
the
time
comes
in
--
in
2014
and
somebody
applies
to
an
insurance
company
for
a
policy
--
and
the
insurance
company
says,
well,
we're
not
going
to
issue
a
policy,
we
don't
think
your
risks
are
ones
that
we're
willing
to
cover,
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
sue
the
insurance
company
and
the
insurance
company
could
raise
as
a
defense
that
this
provision,
the
guaranteed-issue
provision
of
the
statute,
is
not
enforceable
because
it
was
inseverable
from
the
decision
--
from
the
provision
that
the
court
held
unconstitutional
in
2012.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
difficulty
is
that
it
seems
to
me
the
other
possibility
is
for
the
court
to
make
choices,
particularly
based
on
what
it
expects
the
difficulties
of
congress
altering
the
legislation
after
a
court
ruling
would
be.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
severability
decision
that
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
guess
to
some
extent
i
have
to
quarrel
with
the
premise,
justice
scalia,
because
at
least
the
--
the
position
that
i'm
advocating
today,
under
which
the
court
would
only
take
out
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
i
don't
think
would
fit
the
description
that
you
have
given
of
taking
out
the
heart
of
the
statute.
now,
i
do
think
once
you
take
out
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating,
you
are
getting
closer
to
the
heart
of
the
statute.
and
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
difficulties
i
think
with
the
government's
position
is
that
i
think
it's
harder
to
cabin
that,
to
draw
that
bright
line
around
it.
it's
harder
than
the
government
thinks
it
is.
i
mean,
to
begin
with,
even
the
government
seems
to
acknowledge,
i
think,
that
the
exchanges
are
going
to
be
relatively
pale
relatives
of
--
of
the
exchanges
as
they're
intended
to
be,
where
you're
going
to
have
standardized
products,
everybody
can
come
and
make
comparisons
based
on
products
that
look
more
or
less
the
same.
but
the
other
thing
that's
going
to
happen
is
with
the
subsidy
program.
the
--
the
way
that
the
subsidy
program
is
--
is
set
up,
the
subsidy
is
calculated
according
to
essentially
a
benchmark
plan.
and
this
--
if
the
court
wants
to
look
at
the
provisions,
they're
--
they
begin
at
page
64a
of
the
private
plaintiffs'
brief
--
again,
in
the
appendix.
the
particular
provision
i'm
talking
about's
at
68a,
but
there's
a
--
there's
a
question
--
you
--
you're
looking
essentially
to
calculate
the
premium
by
looking
at
a
--
at
a
standardized
silver
plan.
first
question,
obviously,
is,
is
there
going
to
be
any
such
plan
if
you
don't
have
guaranteed-issue
and
community
rating,
if
the
plans
can
basically
be
individualized?
but
the
second
problem
is
that,
in
the
provision
on
68a,
the
--
the
provision
that's
used
for
calculating
the
subsidy,
what
--
what
is
anticipated
in
the
provision
under
the
--
the
act
as
it
is
now,
is
that
you
do
have
the
floor
of
the
income,
you
would
--
you
would
take
this
benchmark
plan,
and
the
government
would
pay
--
pay
the
difference.
and
as
we
talked
about
earlier,
the
benchmark
plan
can
change
for
age,
and
--
and
the
provision
says
it
can
be
adjusted
only
for
age.
so
if
in
fact
you
even
have
such
a
thing
as
a
benchmark
plan
anymore
--
if
the
rates
of
people
in
poor
health
go
up
because
of
individual
insurance
underwriting,
the
government
subsidy
is
not
going
to
pay
for
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
i
don't
think
so,
because
there
are
--
there
are
many
other
tools
to
make
the
same
things
work.
that's
i
think
the
point.
and
if
one
--
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
is
new
york
v.
the
united
states,
where
the
court
struck
down
the
take
title
provision
but
left
other
--
two
other
incentives
essentially
in
place.
even
without
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
there
will
be
a
lot
of
other
incentives
still
to
bring
younger
people
into
the
market
and
to
keep
them
in
the
market.
and
if
--
if
my
reading
of
the
finding
is
correct,
and
that's
all
that
congress
is
saying,
that
this
would
be
useful,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
impossible.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
what
i
would
say
is
if
one
goes
back
to
the,
what
i
think
is
the
proper
severability
standard
and
say,
would
congress
rather
have
not
--
no
bill
as
opposed
to
the
bill
with
whatever
is
severed
from
it.
it
seems
to
me
when
you
are
talking
about
provisions
that
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
minimum
coverage
provision,
there
is
no
reason
to
answer
that
question
as
any
other
way
than
yes,
congress
would
have
wanted
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--an
objective
congress,
your
honor,
not
the
--
specific
not
with
a
vote
count.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
the
reason
is
because
severability
is
by
necessity
a
blunt
tool.
the
court
doesn't
have,
even
if
it
had
the
inclination,
doesn't
essentially
have
the
authority
to
retool
the
statute--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
the
accurate
answer
would
be,
i
am
not
aware
of
a
modern
case
that
says
that.
i
think
there
probably
are
cases
in
the
'20s
and
'30s
that
would
be
more
like
that.
if
i
could
just
take
one
second
to
raise
the
economist
brief
because
justice
alito
raised
it
earlier.
i
just
want
to
make
one
simple
point.
leaving
aside
the
whole
balancing
thing,
if
one
looks
at
the
economist
brief,
it's
very
important
to
note
that
when
they
are
talking
about
one
side
of
the
balance
--
if
may
i
finish.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
when
they
are
talking
about
the
balance,
they
are
not
just
talking
about
the
minimum
coverage
provision.
they
very
carefully
word
it
to
say
the
minimum
coverage
provision
and
the
subsidy
programs.
and
then
so
when
you
are
doing
the
mathematical
balancing,
the
subsidy
programs
are
extremely
large.
they
--
in
the
year
2020,
they
are
expected
to
be
over
$100
billion
in
that
one
year
alone.
so
if
you
are
looking
at
the
numbers,
please
consider
that.
thank
you.
