even
without
chevron
--
i
mean,
even
apply
it;
i
would
have
thought
the
point
of
brand
x
is
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
you
look
at
what
congress
intended,
and
where
they
intended
the
agency
to
have
power
to
interpret,
you
follow
the
agency.
and
you
could
do
that
after
the
event
if
the
basis
for
your
decision
is
that
it
isn't
clear.
but
that
isn't
harlan's
opinion
at
all.
he
goes
and
looks
at
what
congress
meant,
and
what
they
meant
is
treat
basis
like
you
treat
a
deduction;
and
he
gathers
that
from
the
legislative
history.
and
so
i
don't
see
the
basis
for
saying
now
the
agency
still
has
power.
now,
forget
that
one.
i
mean,
that's
one
point
you
might
want
to
address,
but
i
may
be
too
unique
in
that,
in
which
case
it's
not
worth
your
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
well,
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
basis.
i
thought
the
basis
is
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
things:
one
is
you
just
don't
put
in
some
big
category
of
stuff
in
your
return,
and
the
agency
can
never
figure
that
one
out.
and
the
other
is
where
you
don't
state
your
deductions
correctly.
and
now,
the
cost
of
goods
sold
and
the
basis
are
difficult
cases
because
of
the
way
the
--
the
code
defined
"gross
income".
it
defines
it
in
terms
of
gain.
but
harlan
says
they
are
like
deductions
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
that's
how
i
read
it.
but
i
have
a
different
question.
you
can
pursue
this
one
if
you
want.
what's
really
bothering
me
about
this
case,
and
i
can't
quite
figure
out
the
answer
to
this,
is
it
seems
to
me
when
they
filed
that
tax
return
in
april
of
2000
it
was
a
terrible
loophole,
but
these
lawyers
have
the
job
of
creating
loopholes
or
at
least
trying
to
take
advantage
of
them,
okay?
and
the
irs
had
told
them
this
was
okay.
indeed,
they
had
informal
advice
to
that
effect.
now
there's
a
--
you
don't
put
the
date
of
the
year
2000
reg
and
i
don't
know
if
you
are
both
talking
about
the
same
thing.
i
was
really
surprised
there
was
no
date
there.
then
what
happens
is
after
you
lose
in
every
circuit
--
not
you
personally
--
they
lose
in
every
circuit;
and
then
in
the
year
2009
they
say:
though
we
lost
and
though
we
told
everybody
this
is
okay
at
the
time
they
filed
the
return,
now
we
are
going
to
pass
a
new
reg
and
we
are
going
to
penalize
them,
taking
all
back
this
money
9
years
later.
that
seems
to
me
pretty
unfair.
so
i
would
like
to
know
just
that
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
in
your
brief
on
page
4:
"in
2000
the
irs
issued
a
notice
informing
taxpayers
that
son
of
boss
transactions
were
invalid
under
the
tax
law.
"
and
you
cite
without
a
date.
so
i
was
sort
of
curious
whether
that
particular
cite
came
before
or
after
they
filed
their
return.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
say
that
--
and
i
--
in
july
2000,
3
months
after
they
were
filed,
the
commissioner
reiterated
his
view:
"it
has
long
been
held
that
the
extended
statute
of
limitations.
"
da,
da,
da,
"is
limited
to
when
specific
receipts
or
accruals
are
left
out
of
the.
"
--"of
gross
income",
which
is
basically
the
colony
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
talking
about
the
same
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
there
are
two
different
documents.
so
--
so
in
july,
they
are
telling
the
tax
bar
this
is
okay.
and
what
you
say
is
this
document
here,
which
you
refer
to
without
a
date,
told
them
it
wasn't
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
be
rather
curious
if
you
could
sort
that
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
know
there
are
many
ways
of
downplaying
that.
but
i
am
just
curious
as
to
what
happened.
what
about
the
one
you
cited?
when
was
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
that's
the
july.
what
about
this
other,
undated
one.
now,
i
notice
what
you
say
about
it.
you
say
that
it
"described
arrangements
that
unlawfully
purport
to
give
them.
"
--if
i
read
that
piece
of
paper,
which
i
might
--
you
probably
read
it
because
you
cite
it
--
will
i
come
away
with
the
impression,
had,
uh-oh,
these
loophole
arrangements,
son
of
boss,
which
previously
seemed
to
be
okay
are
now
not
okay?
is
that
the
impression
i'll
have?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
impression
you
had?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
all
right.
that's
what
i
suspect.
then
look
at
the
unfairness
of
this.
i'm
not
saying
there
aren't
worse
unfairnesses
in
the
world,
but
nonetheless
people
spent
a
lot
of
money,
the
whole
bar
has
gone
to
an
enormous
effort.
everything
up
through
2000
seems
to
say
you
can
do
this.
you
have
a
case
on
point
in
the
supreme
court.
and
then
9
years
later,
after
continuous
litigation,
the
irs
promulgates
a
regulation
which
tries
to
reach
back
and
capture
people
who
filed
their
return
9
years
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
and
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
actually.
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
ambiguity
and
the
question
is,
is
this
of
the
kind
where
the
agency
later
would
come
and
use
its
expertise.
and
you
are
saying
here
it
was
up
to
the
congress
and
looking
at
what
they
had
in
mind.
all
right,
maybe
that's
the
base,
best
ground.
but
suppose
it
turns
out
the
majority
think
you
are
not
right
on
that,
okay.
now,
here's
my
question.
assuming
you
are
wrong
on
that,
which
i'm
not
sure
you
are,
but
assuming
you
are
wrong,
now
we
get
to
this
regulation.
here
is
my
problem:
one
--
i
have
no
doubt
at
some
level
it
seems
rather
unfair,
but
that
instinct
is
not
enough.
the
question
is
what
--
what's
the
law?
a,
you
can
say
the
word
"open"
doesn't
include
this
case.
but
we
run
into
the
problem
that
an
agency
has
great
authority
to
construe
its
own
regulation.
b,
you
could
say
that,
well,
there's
this
statute
out
there
that
says
don't
apply
it,
and
there
are
two
routes
there.
one
is
something
to
do
with
language,
which
i
think
you
can
think
of,
which
seems
to
cut
very
much
against
you
if
read
naturally,
but
you
can
strain
it
to
read
it
in
your
favor.
and
the
other
has
to
do
with
a
parenthetical
where,
once
again,
although
they
left
it
out
of
their
brief
and
they
put
in
ellipses,
i
can
see
why
they
left
it
out
because
when
you
read
it
it's
again
ambiguous.
we
run
into
the
same
problem.
then
you
could
say:
well,
they
are
not
supposed
to
do
these
things
retroactively,
either
on
common
law
administrative
law
grounds
or
something
like
that;
they
shouldn't
do
it;
it's
unfair.
and
they'll
say:
but
you
see,
it
wasn't
that
unfair;
a
child
of
2
would
have
known
this
was
a
loophole.
that's
how
they
would
have
characterized
it.
and
the
irs
never
said
anything,
except
for
one
district
director
in
a
different
district
that
really
encouraged
or
underwrote
this
kind
of
thing.
so
it's
not
nearly
as
unfair
as
you
think.
if
you
live
by
loopholes,
you
will
die
by
regulation.
you
know,
something
like
that.
so
looking
at
those
four
possible
grounds
--
and
i
can't
think
of
a
fifth
--
you
take
your
choice.
which
is
the
strongest,
and
how
do
you
reply
to
the
objection?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"open",
that's
the
term.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
this
is
tax
case
and
the
tax
code
provides
that
ordinarily,
the
government
has
to
assess
a
deficiency
against
a
taxpayer
within
“three
years
after
the
return
was
filed,”
but
that
three
years
can
be
extended
to
six
years,
where
the
taxpayer
“omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
that's
pretty
large.”
now,
the
question
here
is,
does
this
extension
omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
that's
25%
or
whatever?
the
question
is
whether
that
extension
applies
when
the
taxpayer
overstates
the
basis
in
property
that
he
sold
and
that
has
the
effect
of
understating
his
income.
well,
we
hold
that
this
overstatement
of
basis
is
not
within
the
word
of
the
statute,
an
omission
of
an
amount
from
the
taxpayer's
gross
income.
so,
it
does
not
apply,
i
mean
three
years,
not
six.
in
a
--
the
previous
case,
colony
v.
commissioner,
which
this
court
decided
in
1958,
the
court
considered
a
similar
question,
involving
similar
language
in
a
similar
provision
of
the
earlier
code,
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
rather
than
1954.
the
court
there
held
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
in
particular,
that
word
omit
when
read
in
light
of
its
history
showed
that
the
extended
six-year
period
did
not
apply
when
the
taxpayer
understated
his
income
by
overstating
his
basis.
considerations
of
stare
decisis
lead
us
to
reach
the
same
conclusion
here.
now,
to
reach
that
conclusion,
we
have
--
we
considered
the
government's
claim
that
later
changes
in
--
related
that
other
parts
of
the
statute
require
a
different
conclusion,
but
we
weren't
convinced
by
that
claim.
the
government
also
pointed
out
that
we
should
defer
to
a
treasury
regulation,
interpreting
the
language
and
it
interprets
the
language
in
the
way
favorable
to
the
government
namely,
that
the
six
years
should
apply,
but
we
don't
accept
that
argument
either.
we
think
that
the
court
in
colony
meant
its
interpretation
of
that
word
“omit”
to
constitute
a
definitive
understanding
of
what
congress
meant
by
those
words
which
then
reappear
in
the
1954
code
and
that
fact
that
it
was
meant
to
be
definitive
by
congress
in
the
court's
view
forecloses
the
agency's
more
recent
and
different
interpretation
of
the
words.
we
explain
this
further
in
our
opinion.
we
affirm
the
similar
conclusion
of
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
ginsburg,
justice
sotomayor,
and
justice
kagan.
