but
--
but
you're
--
you're
saying
--
and
i'm
just
trying
to
supplement
justice
scalia's
question
so
you
can
continue
to
answer
it.
you're
saying
that
the
split
is
somehow
more
obscure
or
more
imprecise
in
its
formulation
than
what
colony
did.
you're
saying
that,
oh,
if
congress
knew
about
colony,
they
would
have
done
it
differently,
but
it
was
a
split,
this
was
close
enough
for
government
work.
that
seems
to
be
your
argument.
and--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
don't
understand
why
the
world
was
different
after
colony
addressed
the
split
than
before
colony
addressed
the
split.
the
issue
is
still
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
was
--
what
was
the
date
of
that,
of
bakersfield?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
on
that
point
--
and
we
will
find
out
in
a
minute
--
is
the
respondent
going
to
say,
well,
it's
always
implicit
that
you
have
a
basis;
everybody
knows
you
have
a
basis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that's
--
so
that's
necessarily
what
you
are
telling
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
most
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
was
going
to
ask
in
conjunction
with
justice
kagan's
discussion,
were
the
pre-colony
cases
that
involved
splits,
did
most
of
those
or
any
of
those
relate
to
the
sales
of
goods
and
services
or
were
they
all
real
estate
sales.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
congress
drew
it,
as
i
think
is
implicit
in
justice
kagan's
question,
when
it
talks
just
about
goods
and
services.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
other
reason,
it
was
goods
and
services.
there
is
always
fifo
and
lifo.
i
mean,
there's
--
taxpayers
who
sell
goods
have
inventory
cushions,
and
so
the
irs
is
very,
very
well
aware
that
that
kind
of
judgment
is
involved
in
all
these
statements.
it's
not
quite
the
same
with
basis.
