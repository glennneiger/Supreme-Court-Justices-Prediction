chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-139,
united
states
v.
home
concrete
&
supply.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
only
if
your
reading
of
the
colony
decision
is
correct,
right?
if
we
think
that
colony
definitively
resolved
the
question
before
you,
the
regulation
can't
overturn
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
they
use
the
exact
same
phrase,
and
it's
a
fairly
detailed
--
it's
not
just
a
normal
phrase
they
might
use
elsewhere
--
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
that
phrase
came
in
with
the
baggage
it
carried
from
the
colony
case;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
about
that
argument,
you
rely
very
heavily
on
the
fact
that
justice
harlan
used
the
term
"ambiguous",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
was
writing
very
much
in
a
pre-chevron
world.
i
--
he
was
certainly
not
on
notice
that
that
was
a
term
of
art
or
would
become
a
term
of
art.
and
of
course,
i
didn't
know
him,
but
my
sense
is
he
was
very
gracious
and
polite.
and
you
can
see
him
saying:
well,
that's
a
good
argument,
but.
he's
not
the
sort
of
person
who
would
say:
"this
is
it,
this
is
it.
"
i
don't
think
you
necessarily
can
take
the
use
of
the
word
"unambiguous"
in
his
opinion
to
mean
what
it
does
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
is
there
a
case
where
we
applied
chevron
deference
to
a
pre-chevron
opinion,
in
other
words
saying,
well,
the
court
looked
at
that
but
the
court
said
it
was
ambiguous
and
so
we
apply
chevron.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
that's
the
general
principle.
but
the
point
you
made
just
a
few
moments
ago
is
--
i
think
is
responsive
to
that,
which
is:
we're
not
talking
about
the
merits;
we're
talking
about
a
statute
of
limitation.
the
whole
point
of
a
statute
of
limitation
is
some
things
that
are
bad
are
--
are
--
are
gone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can't
go
back
to
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
what
--
at
what
level
of
the
irs
bureaucracy
can
you
feel
comfortable
that
the
advice
you
are
getting
is
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
single
district
counsel,
you
go
to
there
and
say,
what
do
you
think?
and
it
tells
you,
and
you
say,
well,
that's
fine,
but
i
know
you
don't
count,
so
i
want
to
talk
to
your
boss
--
your
boss?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
what
happened
here
is
that
the
taxpayer
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
district
counsel
of
the
irs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre,
is
it
implicit
that
you
always
have
a
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
--
if
i
could
just
interrupt
you,
before
you
do
so,
to
follow
up
on
justice
kagan's
question.
under
our
current
regime,
can
you
ever
give
more
than
a
70
percent
chance?
because
you
have,
in
the
absence
of
a
definitive
supreme
court
ruling,
the
irs
can
reach
a
different
result
and
it
can
do
that
retroactively.
so,
i
mean,
you
don't
disagree
with
that,
right?
i
mean,
if
we
determine
that
colony
was
ambiguous,
the
irs
can
change
the
rule
in
colony,
and
it
can
apply
that
rule,
new
rule,
retroactively.
that's
what
our
cases
say,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
i
know
you've
got
a
--
your
third
point,
and
i
want
to
let
you
get
it
out,
but
you
mentioned
brand
x.
have
we
ever
applied
brand
x
to
one
of
our
decisions?
have
we
ever
said
an
agency
by
regulation
can
alter
or
change
one
--
a
supreme
court
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
applying
it
to
a
court
of
appeals
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
never
said
an
agency
can
change
what
we've
said
the
law
means.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-139,
united
states
versus
home
concrete
and
supply.
