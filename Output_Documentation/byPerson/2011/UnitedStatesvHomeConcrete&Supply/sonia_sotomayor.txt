but
that
--
but
that
argument
hasn't
changed
between
the
predecessor
statute
and
this
statute.
you
made
the
same
argument
under
the
colony
statute.
it
lost.
so
you
can't
go
back
to
that
argument
because
it's
already
been
rejected.
so
what
goes
from
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
problem
with
your
argument
as
i
read
it
in
the
brief,
it's
a
bit
convoluted,
as
justice
scalia
observed.
but
if
congress
intended
to
change
colony,
it
wouldn't
just
have
created
this
subdivision
(i);
it
would
have
changed
the
main
statement.
so
why
don't
we
read
this
as
simply
saying:
we
accept
whatever
colony
said,
and
the
only
thing
we're
creating
exceptions
around
are
the
following.
the
exception
argument--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
real
estate
developer
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
property.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
i
buy
your
argument
that
it
can't
be
goods
and
services,
because
that
was
the
services
of
this
particular
company.
justice
sonia

well,
they
can't
--
they
can't
change
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
they
are
the
agency
with
expertise
to
define
a
term
within
a
statute.
why
don't
they
have
the
expertise
to
define
either
what
the
words
"gross
income"
mean
or
don't
mean?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
presumptively
because
you're
saying
that
this
is
a
new
interpretation.
but
the
irs
is
taking
the
position
that
the
meaning
hasn't
changed;
that
it's
just
clarifying
some
ambiguity
that
the
courts
have
had;
not
that
it's
had.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
too
many
presumptions
in
your
answer.
the
first
is
that
colony
controls--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
to
me
itself
says
it's
not
--
it's
not
interpreting
the
new
statute--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whatever
its
footnote
meant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
take
your
point
about
the
purpose,
but
you
would
have
to
ignore
every
rule
of
grammar
that
there
is
in
order
to
read
it
your
way,
don't
--
wouldn't
you?
