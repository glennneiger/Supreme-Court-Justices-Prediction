justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
once
--
once
we
resolve
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
that's
the
law
and
the
agency
cannot
issue
a
--
a
regulation
that
changes
the
law
just
because
going
in
the
language
was
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
our
--
our
job
is
not
to
plumb
congress's
psyche
and
decide
what
they
had
in
mind.
it's
to
interpret
the
statute.
and
if,
as
you
acknowledge,
it's
a
pretty
obscure
way
to
change
the
law
from
what
we
said
it
was,
the
law
that's
written
there,
that's
a
very
obscure
way
to
change
it.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
the
law
stays
the
way
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
language
would
have
one
meaning
if
the
very
same
language
were
adopted
after
our
decision
in
--
in
colony,
and
a
different
meaning
if
it
were
adopted,
as
it
was,
before
our
decision
in
colony?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
strange
approach
to
a
--
to
the
meaning
of
a
statute,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
by
far?
by
a
little
maybe,
and
--
and
i
--
i
might
agree
with
that.
but
--
but
we're
not
writing
on
a
blank
slate
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
i
think
colony
may
well
have
been
wrong,
but
there
it
is.
it's
--
it's
the
law.
and
it
said
that
that
language
meant
a
certain
thing.
and
the
issue
is
whether
this
is
--
this
change
is
enough
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
--
and
i'm
dubious
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
if
it
is
--
according
to
brand
x,
it
specifically
addressed
the
question
and
said
that
there
was
no
ambiguity.
but
according
to
brand
x,
if
there
is
ambiguity,
despite
a
holding
of
this
court,
the
agency
can
effectively
overrule
a
holding
by
a
regulation,
right?
isn't
that
what
brand
x
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
question
here
is,
as
the
chief
justice
put
it,
whether,
whether
indeed
colony
meant
by
"ambiguous",
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
the
meaning
of
"ambiguous"
is,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
never
thought
that
a
revision
of
a
statute
of
limitation
was
retroactive
legislation,
just
as
i've
never
thought
that
a
provision
altering
rules
of
evidence
for
a
crime,
even
for
crimes
that
were
committed
before
that
alteration,
is
retroactive
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
the
crucial
date
is
the
date
--
at
least
it's
not
--
well,
you
can
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
say
it's
unfair,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
rule
against,
presumption
against
retroactivity,
technically
applies.
