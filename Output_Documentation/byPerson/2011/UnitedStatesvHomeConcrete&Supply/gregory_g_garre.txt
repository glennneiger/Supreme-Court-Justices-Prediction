mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
our
position
is
the
one
that
the
court
reached
in
colony,
which
is
that
an
overstatement
of
basis
is
not
an
omission
from
gross
income.
what
the
court
held
in
colony
is
that
an
omission
--
an
omission
from
gross
income
is
where
you
leave
out
a
specific
taxable
item
or
receipt.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
got
it
right
when
it
concluded
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
statute
--
on
the
tax
assessments
at
issue
expired
in
2003
and
rejected
the
irs's
extraordinary
efforts
to
avoid
that
result
by
discombobulating
this
court's
decision
in
colony
and
by
seeking
to
retroactively
reopen
and
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
what
the
government
relies
on
principally
is
the
addition
of
subparagraph
(i)
in
the
code
and
that
was
added
in
1954,
before
the
court's
decision
in
1958.
and
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
points
about
subparagraph
(i)
because
i
think
it's
the
crux
of
the
government's
position.
the
first
is
just
the
anomaly
of
their
argument
that
by
adding
this
subparagraph
--
and
it's
on
page
la
of
the
addendum
to
the
red
brief
--
which
explicates
the
definition
of
(a).
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
probably
right.
it
thought
it
was
agreeing
with
the
taxpayer
side
of
the
circuit
split.
there
is
legislative
history
indicating
that
it
also
thought
it
was
addressing
the
computational
rule
of
how
to
get
gross
income,
which
factors
into
the
25
percent
trigger.
i
think
what
maybe
is
most
important
is
this
court
in
colony
looked
at
the
1954
amendments
at
the
suggestion
of
the
government
and
concluded
that
its
decision
was
consistent
with
the
1954
amendments.
that's
in
the
last
line
of
the
decision.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
you
are
right,
he
referred
to
the
whole
6501(e)(1)(a),
which
includes
both
subsections.
it
is
not
clear
that
he
was
identifying
subparagraph
(i).
he
could
have
well
been
referring
to
subparagraph
(ii),
along
the
lines
of
what
my
friend
just
spelled
out,
because
much
of
the
colony
decision
was
based
on
addressing
the
situation
where
the
irs
is
at
a
special
disadvantage
because
something's
been
left
out
entirely.
and
that
really
kind
of
gets
to
the
heart
of
subparagraph
(ii).
but
the
anomaly
of
the
government's
construction
here
today
is
that
colony
would
come
out
differently,
because
colony
doesn't
involve
a
taxpayer
involved
in
the
sale
of
goods
or
service;
it
involved
a
taxpayer
in
the
sale
of
real
property.
so
even
though
this
court
in
colony
said--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
the
sale
of
real
property,
whether
in
parcels
or
otherwise,
has
always
been
treated
differently
than
the
sale
of
--
cost
of
goods
or
services,
which
really
is
a
term
art.
and
if
you
go
back
at
colony,
you
can
see
that
the
court
referred
to
basis,
referred
to
property,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
parties
did
in
their
brief.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
own
brief
framed
the
question
presented
as
overstatement
of
basis
in
the
sale
of
property.
that's
the
situation
that
we
have
here
today.
the
subparagraph
(i)
they
are
referring
to
is
addressed
to
the
specific
situation
of
a
trade
or
business
involved
in
the
sale
of
cost
of
goods
or
services,
which
is
different--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
the
uptegrove
case
did,
the
third
circuit
case.
but
they
involve
--
the
fact
is
they
involved
both
the
sale
of
property
and
the
sale
of
goods
and
services.
and
at
that
time
no
one
was
drawing
this
bright-line
distinction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
did
do
that.
there
was
one
reason
for
congress
to
address
that
specific
situation,
in
that
there
was
a
regulation
that
had
defined
"gross
income"
differently.
it's
appended
at
the
end
of
our
brief
and
it
was
discussed
in
uptegrove.
so
there
was
a
reason
to
single
that
out.
and
i
think
that
the
more--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
opposite
if
i
understand
your
question,
which
is
that
taxpayers
typically
put
more
information
which
is
going
to
put
the
irs
on
notice
when
you
are
dealing
with
basis
and
the
sale
of
property
as
opposed
to
the
costs
of
goods
and
services,
which
involve
many
transactions
and
you
are
dealing
with
them
in
the
aggregate.
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
sale
of
property,
as
in
colony
and
here,
you
are
dealing
with
specific
disclosures
as
to
the
basis.
here
if
you
look
on
page
151
of
the
ja,
it
lays
out
the
adjustment
in
the
basis.
and
the
same
was
true
in
colony.
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
distinction
there,
i
think
it
cuts
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
the
problem
for
the
government
is
all
of
the
amendments
in
1954
were
pro-taxpayer
amendments
as
relevant
here
and
yet
the
government's
conclusion
is
that
by
adding
this
subsection
addressing
the
specific
situation
it
meant
to
take
away
the
general
rule
in
a
way
that
hurt
taxpayers.
it's
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
colony
because
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
everyone
agrees
it's
not
redundant,
even
the
government,
because
what
it
does
is
at
a
minimum,
it
has
the
computational
effect
of
affecting
the
25
percent
trigger.
the
amount
to
get
to
the
trigger
has
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
it's
not
clear,
justice
kagan.
the
federal
circuit
in
the
salman
ranch
case
cited
legislative
history
that
suggested
it
was
trying
to
achieve
just
that
result.
but
i
think
the
broader
point
i
would
make
is,
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
for
congress
to
act
to
provide
an
answer
to
a
specific
situation
that
had
come
up
by
explicating
it,
and
yet
one
doesn't
conclude
that
in
doing
that
it's
intended
to
overstate
--
override
the
entire
general
rule
that's
stated,
particularly
where
it
doesn't
touch
the
language
that's
the
subject
of
the
general
rule.
congress
didn't
in
any
way
touch
the
phrase
interpreted
in
colony,
"omission
from
gross
income".
and
the
anomaly
gets
even
greater
if
you
look
at
congress's
actions
after
colony.
in
1965
congress
amended
the
heading.
now,
granted
it's
only
a
heading,
but
it
amended
it,
the
heading
to
the
subsection,
to
mean
"substantial
omission
of
items",
which
is
perfectly
consistent
with
colony's
interpretation,
directly
contrary
to
the
government's
interpretation.
in
1982
congress
re-enacted
the
same
language,
26
u.s.c.
6229,
which
is
the
provision
for
partnerships,
and
yet
it
omitted
the
subparagraph
(i)
that
the
government
relies
upon
as
the
transformative
provision
narrowing
the
general
rule.
and
so
why
on
earth
would
congress
omit
that
subparagraph
if
it
did
the
transformative
work
that
the
government
suggests?
the
government
doesn't
have
a
response
except
to
say
that
they
have
to
be
interpreted
the
same
way,
which
makes
no
sense
given
the
emphasis
it's
placing
on
subparagraph
(i).
i
think
the
answer
is,
is
subparagraph
(i)
just
doesn't
have
and
was
never
intended
to
have
the
transformative
effect
that
the
government
suggests.
whatever
--
we
can
talk
about
what
the
court
meant
in
colony,
but
i
do
think
that
it's
critically
important
that
colony
is
entitled
to
full
stare
decisis.
in
fact,
it's
stare
decisis
coupled
with
congressional
re-enactment.
the
government
describes
the
world
after
colony,
but
the
fact
is
if
you
go
back
and
look,
no
one
thought
that
colony
was
just
a
ship
passing
the
night
that
had
only
retrospective
significance.
everybody,
including
the
irs,
appreciated
that
colony
was
a
landmark
decision.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
what
my
response
would
be
first
as
to
phinney,
the
fifth
circuit
has
clarified
that
the
government's
construction
of
phinney
is
just
wrong.
phinney
was
consistent
with
the
colony
rule,
it
dealt
with
a
particular
application
of
it.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
i
could
make
one
point
on
phinney
and
then
i
will
address
the
other
cases.
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
the
solicitor
general's
opposition
brief
in
finney
which
recognized
that
colony
was
the
governing
principle.
one
would
think
that
the
government
thought
that
colony
was
just
a
shot
in
time
and
had
no
ongoing
significance,
they
would
have
said
that
in
the
opposition
brief
in
phinney.
the
solicitor
general
accepted
that
colony
is
the
governing
rule,
as
everyone
did.
as
to
the
cases,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
no,
we
can't
point
to
a
case
in
the
1950's,
60s
or
70s
where
they
specifically
confronted
the
question
before
the
court
today.
but
what
i
can
say
is
look
at
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
all
of
those
cases
discuss
this
court's
opinion
in
colony
as
if
it
continues
to
have
lasting
affect
on
the
interpretation
of
the
omits
from
gross
income,
and
yet
in
the
government's
--
the
irs's
own
internal
documents,
we
cite
two,
1976
and
2000
where
the
irs
internally
is
treating
colony
as
a
landmark
decision
which
controls
on
a
current
going
forward
basis.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
put
a
percentage
on
in
affect
whether
colony
was
a
step
i
case
or
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
so.
i
mean,
i
think,
you
know,
the
irs's
actions
here
really
put
taxpayers
in
an
extraordinary
situation.
i
mean
they
are
taking
a
decision
of
this
court
that
says
an
overstatement
of
basis,
no,
that's
not
an
omission
of
gross
income.
they
are
relying
on
the
1954
amendments
to
get
around
that.
look
at
the
colony
decision.
the
colony
decision
says
the
1954
amendments,
no
this
decision
is
perfectly
consistent
with
those.
and
here
comes
the
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
ginsburg,
the
government
in
colony
argued
that
the
1954
amendments
compelled
its
interpretation
which
is
the
one
that
the
court
rejected.
if
this
court
--
this
court
must
have
considered
that
argument
in
reaching
the
opposite
conclusion.
i
think
that
you
are
right,
that
it's
fair
to
describe
that
language
as
dictum.
but
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
even
if
something
is
dictum,
if
it
explicates
the
court's
holding,
the
lower
courts
and
this
court
would
give
it
a
great
weight.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
the
prefatory
language
there
i
think
you're
right,
that's
a
fair
characterization.
but
ultimately
what
the
court
said
was
its
holding
was
in
harmony
with
the
new
statute.
and
you
can't
reach
that
conclusion
if
you
agree
with
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
(i),
your
honor.
i
think
it
could
be
subsection
(ii).
we
don't
know
which
one
he
was
referring
to.
and
the
reason
why
it
could
be
subsection
(ii)
is
because
a
great
deal
of
the
court's
analysis
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
commissioner
was
at
a
disadvantage.
i
would
like
to
address
the
rationale
in
colony.
my
friend
has
referred--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
do
disagree
with
it
--
i
mean,
i
certainly
accept
the
brand
x
part
of
that.
what
we
disagree
with
is
that,
a,
the
irs
has
the
authority
to
retroactively
apply
an
interpretation
of
its
statute,
which
gets
to
the
meaning
of
7805(b)(1);
and,
b,
whether
or
not
the
regulation
in
this
case
on
its
face
applies
retroactively.
but
i
accept--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
they
don't
have
any
leeway
to
overturn
this
court's
decision
if
that
decision
specifically
addressed
the
question.
and
that's
the
language
of
chevron
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--brand
x
says
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
so,
for
this
reason.
because
colony
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
court's
decision,
justice
harlan
in
a
gracious
way,
as
the
chief
suggested,
pointed
out
that
there
could
be
some
ambiguity
in
the
text.
but
then
he
went
on
to
apply
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
would,
i
would
think
that
brand
x
refers
back
to
chevron
and
looks
to
the
first
step
of
chevron.
what
brand
x
is
looking
to
is
whether
or
not
--
it's
really
a
step
one
or
step
two
case.
and
on
step
one,
chevron
looks
to
whether
congress
has
addressed
the
specific
question
presented.
and
if
you
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
colony,
what
justice
harlan
said
was,
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
the
specific
situation
where
a
taxpayer
actually
omitted
some
income
receipt
or
accrual
in
its
computation
of
gross
income.
and
that
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
would
disagree
with
that,
respectfully,
your
honor.
i
think
the
holding
of
the
court
--
and
again,
it's
entitled
to
stare
decisis
effect
even
if
this
court
might
approach
it
differently
today
under
different
modes
of
statutory
construction
otherwise.
the
holding
of
the
court
was
that
congress
addressed
a
specific
situation
of
whether
an
overstatement
of
basis
was
an
omission
from
gross
income,
and
the
court
said
no.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
was
employing
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction,
not
just
legislative
history.
he
talked
about
the
structure
and
purpose
and
the
patent
tax
incongruities
created
by
the
government
position
that
an
overstatement--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that's
the
tool
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
you
would
first
look
at
the
language
of
the
regulation
and
see
whether
or
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--by
its
terms
it
applies
retroactively.
this
court
has
made
clear,
it
made
clear
in
the
bowen
case,
that
it
is
not
retroactively
unless
there
is
a
clear
--
it's
not
retroactive
unless
there's
a
clear
statement
of
retroactivity.
and
our
position
is,
whatever
else
is
true,
that
what
the
effective
date
provision
says
and
the
preamble
says,
it's
just
unclear
about
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it's
retroactive
in
the
worst
way,
for
this
reason:
it
at
a
minimum
extinguishes
an
affirmative
defense,
the
statute
of
limitations.
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
hughes
aircraft
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
again,
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
look
at
landgraf
and
the
cases
talking
about
what
is
retroactive,
this
regulation
here
if
it
is
applied
retroactively
has
the
consequence
this
court
points
to
as
the
worst
kind
of
retroactivity,
which
is
extinguishing
a
valid
defense
in
litigation
and
imposing
new
consequences
for
past
actions.
hughes
aircraft
recognizes
that,
as
do
the
many
courts
of
appeals
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
with
all
due
respect,
the
law
in
2003
when
the
statute
of
limitations
expired
was
colony.
even
if
the
court
--
the
agency
had
leeway
to
reinterpret
it,
it's
changing
the
law.
and
the
reason
why
it's
doing
that
is
it's
doing
it
retrospectively.
if
you
look
at
cases
like
brand
x,
the
theory
is,
you
have
one
interpretation,
and
then
the
agency
going
forward
can
have
another
one.
in
brand
x,
the
agency
sought
to
apply
its
new
interpretation
prospectively.
here,
it's
doing
retrospectively,
and
when
it
does
that,
it
changes
the
law.
maybe
the
concrete
example
of
that
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
no--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--my
point
on
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
my
point
on
that
was
not
that
colony
controlled
as
a
step
one
matter,
it's
that
even
if
the
government
is
right
that
colony
just
said
this
is
one
permissible
reading,
it
was
the
law
as
--
it
was
the
permissible
reading
and
the
law
until
the
government
changed
it.
and
the
government
didn't
change
it,
try
to
change
it,
until
2009.
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
expired
in
2003.
and
so
if
the
government
can
adopt
a
new
interpretation
going
forward,
the
question
is
can
it
apply
that
interpretation
retrospectively
during
the
timeframe
in
this
case.
and
our
position
on
that
is
that
they
certainly
haven't
done
so
unambiguously.
and
that
--
as
this
court
said
in
st.
cyr,
ambiguity
means
unambiguous
prospectivity.
and
the
court
also,
with
justice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
no.
i
mean,
the
court
could,
and
certainly,
i
think
you'd
go
first
to
the
regulation.
and
it
says
"was
open".
the
preamble
says
quote,
"this
is
not
retroactive".
it
says
it
does
not
apply
to
open
tax
--
it
only
applies
to
open
taxed
years,
and
not
to
reopen
closed
tax
years.
that's
on
75
federal
register
78,
898.
the
government
--
the
way
that
the
government
gets
there
is
to
say
that
well,
even
though
we
passed
the
regulation
long
after
the
statute
of
limitations
expired,
because
this
case
is
pending,
we
can
apply
the
new
interpretation
in
determining
whether
the
period
closed
long
before
we
passed
this
regulation.
at
a
minimum,
that's
--
that's
a
highly
strained
if
not
convoluted
way
to
get
around
retroactivity.
the
way
that
the
regulation's
effective
date
and
the
preamble
speaks
about
whether
this
is
retroactive
or
not
is
really
kind
of
nonsensical.
and
i
think
at
a
minimum,
the
taxpayer
ought
to
get
the
benefit
of
that.
and
this
court
should
say
that
if
the
government
really
wants
to
do
--
take
the
extraordinary
step
that
it's
taking
here
to
retroactively
reopen
up
the
statute
of
limitations,
it
ought
to
do
so
in
clear
terms
and
not
the
convoluted
way
it's
done
here.
we
also
think
that
the
--
the
irs
just
lacked
the
authority
to
--
to
legislate
--
to
--
to
pass
a
new
interpretation
on
a
statute
retroactively.
that
gets
to
the
meaning
of
7805,
and
whether
--
which
says
"regulations
relating
to
a
statutory
provision
enacted
after
the
1906
legislation
which
purported
to
strip
the
irs
of
authority
to
act
retroactively.
"
whether
the
"enacted
after"
clause
modifies
regulation
or
statute.
and
we
think
in
context,
it
must
modify
regulation,
because
there's
two
types
of
irs
regulations:
regulations
relating
to
statutes
and
regulations
relating
to
internal
irs
practices.
and
what
congress
said
is
internal
practices,
sure,
you
can
operate
retroactively
when
appropriate.
with
respect
to
new
interpretations
of
statutes,
not
retroactive.
that
was
landmark
legislation
as
part
of
the
taxpayer
bill
of
rights.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
not
if
you
read
regulations
which
relate
to
statutory
provisions
as
--
as
one
thing.
regulations
which
relate
to
statutory
provisions
as
opposed
to
regulations
which
relate
to
irs
provisions.
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it's
clear
congress
was
thinking
about
that
distinction.
if
--
if
you
do
read
that
as
one
unit,
then
"enacted
on
or
after"
obviously
modifies
that.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
in
context
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
it,
to
get
to
that
conclusion.
but
courts
have
adopted
that
conclusion.
the
american
council
on
--
american
college
of
tax
counsel
lays
out
those
cases.
we
think
judge
wilkinson
got
it
right
when
he
referred
to
irs's
position
in
this
case
as
an
inversion
of
the
universe,
and
concluded
that
accepting
irs's
position
would
"stretch
accepted
administrative
deference
principles
beyond
their
logical
and
constitutional
limits.
"
the
irs
has
the
tools
at
its
--
its
disposal
to
identify
tax
deficiency
and
take
appropriate
action
timely.
congress
acted
in
2004
to
respond
to
the
precise
situation
precipitating
this
case
with
son
of
boss
transactions.
it
amended
6501
not
by
changing
the
meaning
of
what's
an
omission
from
gross
income,
but
by
adopting
a
new
provision
which
requires
taxpayers
involved
in
listed
transactions
like
son
of
boss
to
report
many
additional
things,
and
saying
that
the
statute
of
limitations
did
not
apply
at
all
if
they
didn't
make
those
reporting
requirements.
so
going
forward,
the
only
impact
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
going
to
apply
to
everyday
regular
taxpayers
who
simply
erroneously
misstate
or
overstate
the
basis
in
the
sale
of
a
home
or
other
assets.
there's
no
reason
to
take
the
extraordinary
steps
that
the
irs
takes
--
asks
you
to
take
in
this
case
to
reach
that
conclusion.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reject
the
irs's
aggressive
position
on
administrative
power,
and
put
an
end
to
a
case
that
the
taxpayer
should
have
never
had
to
file
in
the
first
place.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
