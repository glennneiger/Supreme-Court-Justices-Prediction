justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart,
don't
you
have
two
arguments?
one
is
that
the
statute
changed,
but
the
other
is
that
even
the
statute
remains
the
--
even
if
the
statute
remained
the
same,
colony
itself
was
a
decision
that
found
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
so
you
have
the
power
under
brand
x
to
go
back
to
that
statute
and
reinterpret
it,
if
you
will?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
the
court
thinks
it
has
to
reach
that
question
because
it
agrees
more
with
justice
scalia
than
with
you
as
to
whether
this
statute
stays
the
same,
then
you
have
independent
brand
x
arguments,
don't
you?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
stewart,
prior
to
this
latest
round
of
litigation,
had
the
irs
ever
said,
ever
given
any
indication,
that
it
viewed
colony
as
not
controlling
any
--
any
--
any
longer?
justice
elena
kagan
and
as
a
result
of
this
case,
the
irs
suggested
in
any
kind
of
guidance
or
rulings
or
anything
else
that
it
viewed
colony
as
an
outdated
decision?
because,
you
know,
i'm
a
taxpayer
and
i'm
reading
colony,
and
i'm
thinking
the
language
of
the
statute
is
still
the
same;
why
wouldn't
colony
control?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
do
you
think
they
added
that
paragraph?
because
it
seems
clear
that
there
was
a
circuit
split
at
that
time
about
exactly
this
question
and
that
this
paragraph
was
a
response
to
that
circuit
split.
so
what
else
could
congress
have
meant
by
it?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
agree
that
that's
not
why
congress
passed
that
provision?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
garre
where
do
you
find
evidence
of
that?
because
you
cite
some
cases
in
your
brief
that
end
up
not
really
supporting
your
position.
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
only
one
case
after
colony
that
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
colony
continues
to
govern
after
the
1954
amendments.
and
that
case,
which
is
phinney,
seems
to
cut
in
the
opposite
direction.
so
am
i
missing
something?
are
there
cases
that
favor
you
that
say
that
yes,
colony
continues
to
control?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
whatever
the
fifth
circuit
said
about
phinney,
when
i
read
phinney,
it
seems
to
me
to
cut
in
the
government's
direction
if
not
to
be
entirely
on
all
fours.
but
i
ask
are
there
any
other
cases
that
you
have
that
suggests
that
courts
did
think
that
colony
was
continuing
to
be
the
governing
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
because
what
i
was
thinking,
mr.
garre,
and
tell
me
what
you
think
the
consequence
of
this
would
be,
is
that
if
i
were
a
taxpayer
and
somebody
came
to
me
and
said
is
colony
still
the
rule,
i
would
have
said,
well,
i
can't
tell
you
100
percent.
i
think
you
are
good
70
to
80
percent,
you
know.
it's
the
same
language,
and
there's
colony
out
there,
and
nothing
the
irs
hasn't
said
that
colony
doesn't
control,
but
i
can't
--
so
i'm
giving
you
70
percent.
do
you
win
if
that's
the
state
of
the
world
as
i
see
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
in
terms
of
what
a
taxpayer
thinks,
whether
colony
continues
to
govern.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
was
the
specific
situation,
but
then
the
question
was
how
clearly
did
congress
speak
to
that
specific
situation.
and
in
order
to
get
his
result,
justice
harlan
says
first
that
the
statute
is
--
that
the
statutory
text
is
ambiguous,
goes
to
a
bunch
of
legislative
history,
and
none
of
that
legislative
history
actually
speaks
to
the
exact
question
before
the
court,
only
by
implication.
so
if
you
look
at
the
whole
of
the
colony
opinion,
it
sure
seems
as
though
there's
a
lot
of
extrapolation
going
on
and
essentially
a
lot
of
ambiguity.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
in
the
end
there
has
to
be
a
resolution.
but
the
question
is,
what
does
it
look
like
before
you
get
to
that
resolution?
and
--
and
justice
harlan
is
doing
a
lot
of
tap
dancing
there,
you
know,
going
to
this
senate
report,
going
to
that
house
report,
going
to
this
colloquy,
before
he
can
come
up
with
an
answer.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
--
do
you
understand
the
preamble
as
part
of
the
regulation?
because
if
i
look
at
the
preamble,
the
preamble
seems
pretty
clear
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
view
that
the
government
did
not
do
this
clearly
enough
must
rest
on
looking
at
the
regulation
without
the
preamble.
