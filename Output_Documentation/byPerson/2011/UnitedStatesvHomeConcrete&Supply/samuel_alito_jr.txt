justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
can
hardly
think
of
a
statutory
interpretation
question
that
we
have
gotten
that
doesn't
involve
some
degree
of
ambiguity,
if
we're
honest
about
it.
we
take
a
case
where
there's
a
conflict
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
so
there
was
at
least
enough
ambiguity
in
those
cases
for
one
or
more
courts
of
appeals
to
come
to
an
interpretation
that
is
contrary
to
the
one
that
we
ultimately
reach.
so
what
degree
of
ambiguity
is
brand
x
referring
to?
