mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
disputed
question
in
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includable
therein.
"
in
26
u.s.c.
6501(e)(1)(a).
more
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
an
omission
from
gross
income
occurs
when
a
taxpayer
overstates
his
basis
in
sold
property
and
thereby
understates
the
gain
that
results
from
the
sale.
in
december
2010,
after
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
the
treasury
department
issued
published
regulations
that
interpreted
section
6501(e)(1)(a)
to
apply
in
overstatement
of
basis
cases.
those
regulations
reflect
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
ambiguous
statutory
language
and
they
are
accordingly
entitled
to
deference
under
chevron.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
the
court
in
colony
had
interpreted
the
statutory
language
to
be
unambiguous
or
if
the
court
in
colony
had
issued
an
authoritative
interpretation
that
congress
had
then
built
upon,
that
would
be
correct.
but
the
court
in
colony
stated
that
the
language
was,
in
its
words,
"not
unambiguous".
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
court
in
colony
purported
to
give
a
definitive
definition
of
the
phrase
"omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includable
therein.
"
wherever
it
appears
in
the
united
states
code.
and
the
court
in
the
first
paragraph
of
its
opinion
in
colony
said
"the
sole
question
before
us
is
whether
the
taxpayer
is
subject
to
the
extended
assessment
period
under
the.
"
19
--
"under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
"
and
as
the
d.c.
circuit,
for
instance,
pointed
out
in
intermountain,
what
we
are
interpreting
now
is
the
1954
code.
it's
true
that,
like
the
1939
code,
it
includes
the
phrase
"omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includible
therein.
"
but
it
also
includes
adjacent
provisions
that
bear
upon
the
meaning
of
that
phrase.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
1954
code
was
enacted
in
1954,
and
the
colony
decision
came
in
1958.
and
so,
i
would
take
your
point
that
if
congress
had
enacted
the
same
language
after
this
court's
decision
in
colony,
then
the
adjacent
statutory
provisions
that
we're
relying
on
would
be
pretty
indirect
means
of
expressing
an
intent
to
change
the
law.
but
what
congress
was
reacting
to
in
1954
was
not
this
court's
colony
decision;
it
was
reacting
to
a
circuit
conflict
and
trying
to
resolve
that
conflict.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
let
me
--
let
me
point
to
the
statutory
provisions
that
i
have
in
mind,
to
explain
a
little
bit
more
fully
why
we
think
that
the
context
in
which
the
new
provision
or
the
1954
provision
appears
bears
on
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
disputed
phrase.
it's
at
page
la
of
the
red
brief,
the
appendix
to
the
respondents'
brief.
and
--
and
the
--
the
general
rule
stated
in
subsection
(a)
is:
"if
the
taxpayer
omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includable
therein
which
is
in
excess
of
25
percent
of
the
amount
of
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
the
assessment
period
is
6
years
rather
than
3
years.
"
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
for
purposes
of
the
internal
revenue
code
generally
the
term
"gross
income"
is
defined
to
include
gains
derived
from
dealings
in
property.
and
in
that
sense,
it
might--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
if
you
look
at
subparagraph
(i),
roman
(i)
--
or
roman
(i)
after
the
general
rule,
it
says:
"in
the
case
of
a
trade
or
business,
the
term
"gross
income"
means
the
total
of
the
amounts
received
or
accrued
from
the
sale
of
goods
or
services,
if
such
amounts
are
required
to
be
shown
on
the
return,
prior
to
diminution
by
the
cost
of
such.
"
goods
--
"such
sales"--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
i
say,
i
would
agree
that
if
congress
had
passed
this
statute
after
the
court's
decision
in
colony,
that
this
would
have
been
a
fairly
oblique
way
to
reflect
an
intent
to
change
what
the
court
had
done.
but
congress
was
acting
in
1954,
before
the
court's
decision
in
colony,
and
it
was
reacting
to
a
circuit
conflict.
and
i
think
it's
just
as
fair
to
say
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
--
it
may
be
strange,
but
i
think
in
a
sense
it's
the
respondents
who
are
striving
for
strangeness,
in
the
following
way--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
guess
there
are
two
things
i'm
saying.
the
first
thing
i'm
saying
is
in
order
to
construe
the
statute
we
need
to
not
put
ourselves
in
--
attempt
to
put
ourselves
in
the
minds
of
congress,
but
at
least
be
aware
of
the
state
of
the
world
at
the
time
that
congress
acted.
and
in
1954,
when
congress
acted,
there
was
the
circuit
split.
and
if
congress
had
wanted
to
endorse
the
colony
rule
going
forward
and
apply
it
to
trade
--
to
non-trade
and
business
taxpayers
as
well
as
trades
and
businesses,
the
most
natural
thing
would
have
been
to
change
the
word
"amount"
in
the
main
rule
to
"item",
to
make
clear
that
the
main
rule
would
apply
only
when
an
item
of
gross
receipts
had
been
left
off
the
return
altogether.
it
also
would
have
been
natural,
if
congress
had
wanted
that
rule
to
apply
going
forward,
to
change
the
term
"gross
income"
in
the
main
rule
to
say
"gross
receipts",
because
gross
income--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
way
i
would
respond
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
say
if
you
look
at
the
statute
in
its
current
form,
both
the
text
of
the
main
rule
and
the
adjacent
provisions
that
contextually
bear
on
its
meaning,
than
i
think
ours
is
by
far
the
better
interpretation.
and
really,
what
respondents--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
what--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
my
main
point
is,
we
think
our
reading
of
the
text
is
better,
and
what
respondents
have
going
for
them
is
the
argument
that,
whether
or
not
this
is
the
way
you
would
otherwise
construe
the
statute,
once
colony
has
said
what
the
statute
meant,
the
court
is
bound
by
it.
and
our
point
is
that
methodology
doesn't
really
work
with
this
provision,
because
the
court
in
colony--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
do
have
the
power
under
brand
x,
but
we
--
we
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
question.
and
when
the
court
in
colony
said
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
the
court
said
that
both
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
and
it
also
said
at
the
beginning
"the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
the
extended
assessment
period
applies
under
the
'39
code.
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case.
obviously,
brand
x
is
a
recent
decision
of
this
court.
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it's
--
it's
perilous
to
kind
of
put
a
chevron
overlay
on
decisions
that
were
issued
before
chevron.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
give
two
--
let
me
give
two
responses
to
that,
justice
breyer.
i
think
in
effect
what
justice
harlan
did
for
the
court
in
colony
was
to
construe
the
term,
the
reference
to
an
amount
of
gross
income,
as
though
it
meant
item
of
gross
receipts.
that
was
the
practical
effect
of
the
court's
decision.
and
i
think
two
of
the
--
two
of
the
adjacent
provisions
of
the
current
code
make
clear
that
that's
not
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
at
the
time
that
the
2009
regulation
was
promulgated
first
in
temporary
form,
we
had
lost
cases
in
two
courts
of
appeals.
one
was
bakersfield
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
said
that
because
the
statutory
language
was
ambiguous
the
agency
might
be
able
still
to
promulgate
a
regulation
that
would
get
chevron
deference.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
was
in,
i
believe,
either
--
i
believe
2008
was
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
bakersfield.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
was
--
at
any
rate,
it
was
before
the
--
the
issuance
of
the
regulation
in
temporary
form.
a
couple
of
months
before
the
regulation
was
promulgated
we
had
lost
salman
ranch
in
the
federal
circuit,
but
that
was
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
at
that
time
we
had
won
this
issue
in
four
trial
courts.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
i
think
probably
the
best
indication
of
our
--
the
position
in
the
intervening
years,
and
we
agree
that
there
is
a
surprising
dearth
of
law
--
was
the
fifth
circuit
litigation
in
phinney,
p-h-i-n-n-e-y,
which
was
decided
in
1968.
phinney
involved
a
situation
in
which
the
taxpayer
accurately
reported
the
amount
of
gross
receipts,
approximately
$375,000,
but
misstated
the
nature
of
the
receipts
as
proceeds
of
a
stock
sale
rather
than
of
an
installment
sale.
and
the
reason
that
that
misstatement
of
the
nature
of
the
receipt
made
a
difference
was
that
it
potentially
affected
the
taxpayer's
entitlement
to
take
a
stepped-up
basis.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
in
phinney
said
that
was
subject
to
the
extended
assessment
period,
that
the
misstatement
of
the
nature
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
--
i
think
one
reason
you
might
think
that
is
that
if
you
were
--
you
--
the
opinion
was
not
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
the
1954
code
had
been
enacted
in
the
meantime
and
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
say:
"we
are
discussing
only
the
1939
code
and
we
are
not
pronouncing
on
the
meaning
of
the
1954
code,
other
than
to
note
that
our
conclusion
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
unambiguous
language
of
new
6501(e)(1)(a).
"
"and
as
the
d.c.
circuit
explained
in
intermountain,
that
is
best
read
as
a
reference
to
subparagraph
(i),
which
says
that
for
a
trade
or
business
taxpayer
"gross
income"
will
mean
gross
receipts
without
an
offset
for
the
cost
of
acquiring
goods
and
services.
"
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--as
a
taxpayer
you
would
at
least
be
on
notice
that
there
was
uncertainty
as
to
the
proper
meaning
of
the
--
the
code.
judge
boudin
had
written
for
the
first
circuit
in
a
case
called
cc&fw.
operations
in
2001
that
it
was
at
least
doubtful
whether
the
main
holding
of
colony
carried
over
to
the
new
--
the
1954
code.
that
was
certainly
dictum,
but
it
also
flagged
the
fact
that
this
was
a
subject
of
uncertainty.
and
remember,
the
provision
at
issue
here
doesn't
bear
on
the
legality
of
the
taxpayer's
substantive
returns.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
irs
has
3
years
or
6
years
to
make
an
extended
assessment.
so
as
of
2003,
when
3
years
from
the
date
of
the
return
had
run
for
these
taxpayers,
i
think
the
--
what
was
out
there
gave
them
notice
that
there
was
at
least
uncertainty
whether
colony
applied.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
whether--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
no,
those
were
two
different
documents.
the
two
documents--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
2000
notice
that
the
respondents
have
cited,
i
think
the
--
the
most
important
point
to
make
about
it
is
that
it
was
the
view
of
a
single
--
of
the
district
counsel
for
a
single
district
within
the
irs.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
the
exact
date
in
2000,
but
it
--
it
has
long
been
established
that
transactions
lacking
economic
substance
and
transactions
motivated
purely
for
tax
avoidance
purposes
may
be
disregarded
from
--
by
the
irs.
that
--
that
was
a
preexisting
proposition.
when
we
issued
the
notice
with
respect
to
son
of
boss
transactions
in
--
in
particular,
that
was
simply
the
irs's
way
of
informing
taxpayers
that
we
regard
this
particular
avoidance
mechanism
as
encompassed
by
the
general
principle
that
transactions
lacking
economic
substance--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
that's
the
proposition
that
the
respondents
are
citing
the
different
2000
document
for.
they
are
citing
it
as
though
it
were
a
definitive
statement
of
agency
position
as
to
the
operation
of
the
assessment
period.
it
--
it
was
not
that.
it
was
a
document
issued
by
a
single
district
counsel,
and
in
a
sense
the
--
the
reference
to
colony
as
continuing
to
--
as
though
it
continued
to
govern
the
--
the
1954
code
was
dictum,
because
the
district
counsel
even
in
that
document
stated
that
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--this
is
not
advice
to
the
taxpayer.
that
document
was
a
memorandum
from
the
district
counsel
to
another
irs
official.
the
other
irs
official
was
seeking
guidance
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
we
needed
to
get
within
the
3-year
assessment
period
or
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
rely
on
the
6-year
assessment
period.
and
although
the
district
counsel
cited
colony
in
a
way
that
it
suggested
that
it
continued
to
control
the
operation
of
the
1954
code,
the
district
counsel
stated
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
to
rely
on
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
but
not
--
didn't
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
irs
did
in
litigating
the
case
in
phinney,
didn't
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
irs
did
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--first
i
would
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
notice
would
not
say
--
tell
you
anything
relevant
to
the
computation
of
the
assessment
period.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
by
saying,
would
seem
to
say
that
you
could
do
this.
i
don't
think
there
were
any
affirmative
irs
statements
that
could
lead
people
to
believe
that
the
son
of
boss
mechanism
was
okay.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
no,
it's
not
true
that
the
irs
had
advised
people
that
son
of
boss
transactions
were
okay.
it
wasn't
until
2000
that
the
irs
issued
a
specific
document
that
said
as
a
matter
of
agency
policy
they
are
not
okay.
but
again,
that
document
was
just
a
kind
of
case-specific
application
of
the
more
general
proposition,
of
the
more
general
proposition
that
transactions
lacking
economic
substance
can
be
disregarded.
with
respect
to
why
the
overstatement
of
basis
is
treated
differently
from
the
overstated
deduction,
that
follows
inexorably
from
the
language
of
the
code.
that
is,
congress
defined
the
conduct
that
would
trigger
the
general
rule
as
an
omission
from
gross
income,
and
because
of
the
way
that
gross
income
is
defined
an
overstatement
of
basis
can
lead
to
an
understatement
of
gain,
which
in
turn
is
taken
into
account
in
computing
gross
income.
a
deduction
may
ultimately
affect
taxable
income,
but
it
doesn't
affect
gross
income.
and
so
there
would
be
no
way
of
reading
the
statute
to
encompass
that.
now
as
to
why
congress
would
have
done
this,
i
think
a
clue
is
furnished
by
subparagraph
roman
(ii)
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
la,
and
it
says:
"in
determining
the
amount
omitted
from
gross
income,
there
shall
not
be
taken
into
account
any
amount
which
is
omitted
from
gross
income
stated
in
the
return
if
such
amount
is
disclosed
in
the
return
or
in
a
statement
attached
to
the
return
in
a
manner
adequate
to
apprise
the
secretary
of
the
nature
and
amount
of
such
item.
"
and
so
that
provides
a
safe
harbor
that
says
even
if
you
fall
within
the
general
rule,
even
if
you
understated
your
gross
income
by
more
than
25
percent,
if
at
some
point
in
the
return
you
gave
the
irs
adequate
information
to
notice
that
the
misstatement
had
taken
place,
you
will
be
off
the
hook
for
the
secure
assessment
period.
and
i
think
that
is
highly
relevant
in
responding
to
the
policy
concern
that
justice
harlan
identified
in
colony.
that
is,
justice
harlan
said:
the
reason
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
restrict
the
statute
to
situations
where
an
item
is
left
off
the
return
altogether
is
that
those
would
be
the
most
difficult
for
the
irs
to
catch;
the
irs
would
be
placed
at
a
special
disadvantage.
here
in
subparagraph
(ii),
congress
has
accomplished
the
same
intent,
but
through
a
different
mechanism.
that
is,
it's
made
the
general
rule
sweep
more
broadly,
but
given
taxpayers
an
out
where
the
disclosures
are
adequate.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
he
will
say
--
i
don't
want
to
speculate
too
much
on
what
he
will
say,
but
i
think
his
position
is
an
overstatement
of
basis
could
never
trigger
the
assessment
period
because
the
item
of
gross
receipts
would
have
been
adequately
disclosed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
three
quick
points.
first,
mr.
garre
refers
to
the
amended
heading
of
section
--
subsection
6501(e),
which
now
states
(e)
refer
to
amounts
and
some
to
items.
subsection
(e)(2),
which
deals
with
estate
and
gift
taxes,
refers
to
omission
of
items.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
congress
chose
that
term
precisely
to
make
clear
that
the
understatement
--
or
the
overstatement
or
understatement
of
an
item
that
was
reported
will
not
give
rise
to
the
extended
period.
the
second
thing
is
that
at
autumn,
respondents
argue
that
the
phrase
--
the
phrase
"amount
of
gross
income"
should
be
construed
to
mean
item
--
of
gross
receipts.
and
they
don't
offer
any
real
textual
argument
as
to
why
that
would
be
a
sound
reading.
really,
they
rely
exclusively
on
colony.
but
the
court
in
colony
said
at
the
beginning
of
its
opinion
that
it
was
pronouncing
only
on
the
1939
code.
it
said
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
that
it
was
not
generally
trying
to
construe
the
1954
code.
and
it
stated
that
the
relevant
--
most
relevant
language
was
not
unambiguous.
and
i
think
the
recognition
of
ambiguity
is
relevant
in
part
because
it
sets
up
our
brand
x
argument,
but
it's
also
relevant
because
saying
that
a
particular
snippet
of
language
is
unambiguous
is
to
recognize
that
its
meaning
may
vary
depending
on
context.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
mean
--
brand
x
was
the
first
case
that
announced
the
brand
x
principle,
and
the
court
has
not
applied
it
since.
justice
stevens--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
was
applying
it
to
a
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
justice
stevens
wrote
a
separate
opinion
in
brand
x,
suggesting
that
it
might
not
apply
to
decisions
of
this
court,
but
the
court
as
a
whole
did
not
pronounce
on
that.
and
then
the
third
point
i
would
want
to
make
is
that
mr.
garre
referred
to
cases,
and
one
irs
general
counsel
opinion
that
were
issued
during
the
period
between
1958
and
2000
that
applied
colony
to
the
current
statute,
but
they
did
so
in
a
very
specific
way.
that
is,
they
relied
on
the
aspects
of
colony
that
talked
about
congress's
purpose
to
reserve
the
extended
assessment
period
for
cases
in
which
the
irs
was
at
a
special
disadvantage
due
to
inadequate
disclosure.
and
those
cases
applied
that
language
in
elucidating
current
subparagraph
(ii),
which
provides
a
safe
harbor
in
cases
of
adequate
disclosure.
respondents'
position
goes
much
further,
though.
respondent
is
attempting
to
rely
on
colony
for
the
proposition
that
even
if
its
disclosures
were
inadequate,
the
extended
period
still
can't
be
applied
to
it.
and
none
of
the
decisions
on
which
respondents
rely
establish
that
proposition.
thank
you.
