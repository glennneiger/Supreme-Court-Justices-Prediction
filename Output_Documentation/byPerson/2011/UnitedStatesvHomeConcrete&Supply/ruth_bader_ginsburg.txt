justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
did
say
that
something
was
unambiguous
and
that
was
the
little
(i)
that
was
added.
and
he
also
said
he
wasn't
taking
any
position
on
the
'54
code;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
clarify,
mr.
stewart,
two
things
that
justice
breyer
brought
up.
one,
he
said
that
the
irs
had
given
people
advice
that
son
of
boss
was
okay,
it
would
work,
this
tax
shelter,
this
tax
scheme
would
work.
and
then
he
said
--
he
suggested
that
a
basis
is
like
deductions,
and
you
agree
that
overstatement
of
deductions
don't
get
you
the
longer
statute
of
limitations.
so
why
--
why
should
an
inflated
basis
get
you
to
6
years
when
inflated
deductions
don't?
that's
one
question.
and
the
other
question
is,
is
it
so
that
agents
told
people
that
son
of
boss
would
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
got
to
--
that's
got
to
refer
to
(i).
it
can't
refer
to
--
harlan
said
two
things.
he
said:
it's
ambiguous,
therefore
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
find
out
what
the
predecessor
section
means.
and
then
he
says:
i'm
not
going
to
speculate
on
what
this
new
thing
means,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
result
we
reach
in
colony
is
in
harmony
with
the
unambiguous
language
of
6501,
et
cetera.
the
only
unambiguous
language
that
he
could
be
referring
to
is
in
(i)
because
he's
just
--
he
had
said
the
earlier
language
was
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
would
they
be
redundant?
i
mean,
if
the
statute
without
little
(i)
meant
what
you
said
it
meant,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
put
this
in,
because
"omission
from
gross
income"
would
refer
to
items
of
income
items,
period.
so
what
work
does
(i)
do,
if
it
just
--
if
the
main
rule,
the
general
rule,
is
as
you
say
it
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
also
says
before
that,
mr.
garre,
and
without
doing
more
than
noting
the
speculative
debate
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
congress
manifested
an
intention
to
clarify
or
change
this
1939
code.
so,
not
taking
the
position
on
whether
the
new
section
changes
the
code
and
the
part
that
is
in
harmony,
i
can't
see
how
that
can
be
read
to
mean
anything
other
than
the
(i),
which
is
unambiguous,
and
certainly
in
harmony
with
the
result
in
colony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
i
read
it,
it
doesn't
say,
as
colony
controls,
it's
saying
we
are
not
going
to
take
the
position
on
what
the
1954
code
does,
whether
it
clarifies
or
changes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
says
"unambiguous
language",
and
he
can't
mean
the
general
rule
because
he's
already
said
that
is
ambiguous.
he's
got
to
mean
the
new
position,
which
is
certainly
unambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
did
say
--
he
say
he
was
looking
to
--
he
said
the
text
isn't
clear;
therefore,
i
look
to
the
legislative
history.
