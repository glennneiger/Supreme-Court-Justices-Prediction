but
it
--
it
seems
to
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
rejected
in
--
in
our
most
recent
and
earlier
case
on
copyright.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
the
phrase
and
the
argument
about
the
public
domain?
is
in
your
view
that
just
a
synonym
for
when
the
time
has
ended?
or
is
there
something
more
substantive
to
it
that
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
public
somehow
owns
what's
in
the
public
domain?
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
--
but
how
does
the
phrase
--
so
the
public
domain
is
simply
a
conclusion
to
express
that,
the
operation
of
that
principle?
the
public
domain
doesn't
have
any
more
substantive
meaning
other
than
to
just
express
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
limited
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
once
again,
it's
just
a
conclusion
for
the
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
now
you're
saying
that
there
is
a
substantive
component
to
this
public
domain
argument,
that
the
public
does
own
something.
and
that's
different
from
what
i
thought
you
answered
earlier
when
you
said
it's
just
conclusory
for
a
limited
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying,
and
i
already
gave
this
answer
because
originally,
i
thought
i
was
going
to
put
in
my
notes,
the
first
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
copyright
area
--
and
that
just
can't
be.
what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
this
law
will
pass
intermediate
scrutiny.
it's
an
important
governmental
interest
and
it's
substantially
related
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
--
can
you
--
can
you
cite
me
to
some
--
some
authority
which
says
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
a
copyright?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
amendment
test
doesn't
apply.
there
has
--
there
has
to
be
a
--
a
test.
now
maybe
you
say
that
it
isn't
immediate
scrutiny;
it's
something
else.
but
--
but
certainly
the
first
amendment
is
implicated.
