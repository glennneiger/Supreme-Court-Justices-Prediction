justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
congress
grant
copyright
protection
to
works
that
had
lost
that
protection
due
to
the
expiration
of
the
period
that
was
provided
for
under,
under
previous
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
doesn't
this
--
doesn't
section
514
provide
copyright
protection
for
works
that
were
created
by
people
who
are
long
since
dead?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
i
don't
understand
the
limit
that
you
were
just
suggesting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
they
have
to
be
dead
for
some
period
of
time
before--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--congress
is
unable
to
give
them
back
their
copyright?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
that
show
at
most
that
retroactive
protection
can
be
granted
when
there
is
an
enormous
interest
in
doing
so,
namely,
the
establishment
of
the
uniform
copyright
system
at
the
beginning
of
the
country,
because
if
congress
had
not
done
that
and
had
said
the
alternative
would
be
to
say
things
can
be
copyrighted
going
forward,
then
you
would
have
different
copyright
laws
in
all
of
the
states?
