wait
a
minute.
who
have
or
have
not
transferred
to
any
other
person.
so
you
don't
have
to
have
a
copyright,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
read
it
again?
who
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
have
not
transferred
to
any
other
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
oh,
the
copyright.
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
--
would
you
spend
a
little
bit
of
time
on
your
other
argument,
i
take
it
to
be
a
separate
argument
apart
from
the
--
you
know,
time
limit
argument,
the
argument
that
the
problem
here
is
that
this
law
does
not
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts,
and
therefore
does
not
comply
with
the
copyright
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
arts?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
put
it
--
i
think
it's
the
same
point
another
way.
let's
assume
i'm
a
multibillionaire
and
i
receive
an
award
as
a
great
patron
of
the
arts
because
i
have
furthered
the
arts
by
giving
several
million
dollars
to
someone
who
has
already
composed
an
opera
or
who
has
already
written
a
book.
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
i
be
furthering,
be
viewed
as
furthering
the
arts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
the
copyright
law
permits
--
the
--
the
--
excluding
things
from
the
public
domain,
so
long
as
in
the
process
of
doing
it,
you're
furthering
the
arts.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
assumption
of
this
line
of
questioning,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
mere
marketing
in
the
united
states
of
stuff
that
has
already
been
created
promotes
the
progress
of
the
useful
arts.
i'm
not
sure
it
promotes
the
progress
of
the
useful
arts.
it
makes
more
money
for
the
guy
who
wrote
it,
but
doesn't
incentivize
anybody--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
create
art.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
verrilli,
i
do
not
find
that
an
appealing
argument.
it
seems
to
me
congress
either
had
the
power
to
do
this
under
the
copyright
clause
or
it
didn't.
i
don't
think
that
powers
that
congress
does
not
have
under
the
constitution
can
be
acquired
by
simply
obtaining
the
agreement
of
the
senate,
the
president
and
zimbabwe.
i
do
not
think
a
treaty
can
expand
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
i
mean,
this
is
either
okay
under
the
copyright
clause
or
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
nice
to
know
the
reason
for
it,
but
you
would
still
have
to
establish
that
it's
within
the
power
of
the
federal
government--
