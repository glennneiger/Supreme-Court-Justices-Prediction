mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
picking
up
on
a
point
that
my
friend
made
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
foreign
works
what
congress
has
done
is
set
the
copyright
term
at
zero.
i
don't
really
think
that's
a
fair
description
of
the
situation.
it
obscures
what
section
514
actually
does
and
what
congress
is
all
about
here.
since
1891,
congress
has
concluded
as
a
matter
of
copyright
law
that
foreign
works
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
domestic
works.
the
problem
with
respect
to
the
authors
that
section
514
covers
is
not
that
congress
set
the
copyright
limit
at
zero,
it's
that
as
a
matter
of
foreign
relations,
we
did
not
have
treaties
with
these
individual
countries.
and
what
514
does
is
remedy
that
be
problem.
what
514
says
is:
with
respect
to
a
defined
set
of
foreign
authors,
they
get
the
remainder
of
the
copyright
term
that
they
would
otherwise
have
gotten,
and
nothing
more,
had
they
lived
in
countries
where
we
had
--
with
which
we
had
copyright
relations
at
the
time
they
published,
or
had
they
complied
with
the
formalities
that
we
used
to
enforce
but
no
longer
do
to
perfect
and
renew
copyrights.
that's
what
it
does.
it
doesn't
grant
anybody
a
perpetual
term.
it
does
not
renew
a
copyright
term
that
has
run
its
full
course
and
create
a
new
one.
it
rectifies
that
problem
which
doesn't,
doesn't
reflect
anything
about
a
congressional
judgment
setting
the
copyright
term
at
zero.
it
could--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
think
that
the,
there
isn't
an
ironclad
limit
that
can
be
derived
from
the
text
of
the
copyright
clause
or
from
history
that
would
say
that
congress
is
forbidden
in
any
circumstance
from
doing
that.
we
do
think
that
there
are
significant
limits
in
the
text
of
the
copyright
clause
that
would
restrict
any
ability
congress
might
have
to
do
that.
but
one
thing
i
think
is
important
here
is
that
section
514
is
not
a
statute
in
which
congress
did
that,
and
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
any
assessment
by
this
court
of
whether
congress
had
that
power
should
await
a
concrete
context
in
which
congress
exercises
it,
if
it
ever
does.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
excuse
me,
justice
sotomayor?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
one
limit
i
think
is
a
quite
important
one
is
that
the
copyright
clause
says
that
you
can
only
grant
copyright
in
authors,
to
authors.
and
as
a
work
gets
older
and
older
when
you're
talking
about
shakespeare
and
ben
johnson,
there
really
at
that
point
isn't
an
author
in
which
you
could
vest
the
copyright.
and
creating
any
copyright
for
a
long-expired
work
like
that
would
really,
i
think,
raise
the
problem
that
the
framers
were
addressing
by
restricting
copyright
to
authors
which
was
to
avoid
the
creation
of
patronage
monopolies
in
which
publishers
who
weren't
the
authors
could
claim
the
exclusive
rights
of
copyright.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
they--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
but
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
what
514
does,
justice
alito,
is
provide
copyright
protection
to
works
of
foreign
authors
whose
works
still
have
copyright
protection
in
their
own
country,
whether
they
are
dead
or
alive.
so
long
as
the
work
has
protection
in
the
country,
then
514
provides
copyright
protection.
and
the
reason
it
does
so
is
to
ensure
our
compliance
with
the
berne
convention.
and
the
why
here
is
very
important
and
i
think
provide
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
how
514
contributes
to
the
progress
of
arts
and
sciences.
what
514
does,
514
is,
in
essence,
the
price
of
admission
to
the
international
system.
we
decided,
the
policymaking
branches
of
our
government,
the
executive
and
the
congress,
decided
that
we
needed
to
be,
and
was
in
the
national
interest,
to
be
part
of
the
international
copyright
system
and
to
join
the
berne
convention
to
accomplish
that.
the
reason
we
did
so
was
because
our
intellectual
property
is
subject
to
very
serious
levels
of
piracy
in
many
foreign
countries
because
of
under
enforcement.
by
joining
berne,
what
we
did
was
commit
ourselves
to
the
international
standards.
and
by
enacting
section
514
to
implement
the
uruguay
round
agreements
in
1994,
what
we
did
was
say
to
the
world
that
we
are
going
to
ensure
compliance
in
this
country.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
completely--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
completely
agreement
with
that,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no
textual
limit
in
the
copyright
clause
that
would
preclude
congress
from
enacting
this
statute.
the
petitioners
have
also
raised
a
first
amendment
argument.
we
don't
think
first
amendment
scrutiny
applies
here.
to
the
extent
it
did,
the
why
would
matter
there,
and
there
is
definitely
a
substantial
interest
on
the
part
of
congress
in,
in
ensuring
compliance
with
berne
and
getting
protection
for
our
works
in
berne.
now
in
eldred,
the
court
did
say,
i
think
quite
clearly,
that
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
copyright
clause
that
a
new
financial
benefit
granted
through
an
existing,
that
a
new
financial
benefit
cannot
be
granted
to
an
existing
work.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
disagree.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
because
it
creates
additional
incentives
for
authors
today
and
going
forward,
because
they
know
that
there
is
a
much
greater
likelihood
that
whatever
intellectual
property
they
create
will
be
better
protected
in
foreign
countries
as
a
result
of
our
joining
the
berne
convention.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
we
can't
--
if
we
can't
get
the
protections
of
berne,
berne
is
not
a
menu
in
which
we
get
to
choose
options.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
there
is
another
way
of
looking
at
that,
justice
breyer,
of
course,
which
is
that
the,
but
for
the
fact
that
these
individual
authors
lived
in
countries
that
didn't
have
copyright
relations
with
the
united
states,
they
would
have
the
protection
of
our
copyright
law
and
they
would
have
the
term
of
copyright--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
there
is
no
textual
limit
in
the
copyright
clause
that
says
that
congress
cannot
provide
the
same
limited
term
to
those
categories
of
works
that
it
provides
to
other
works.
there
just
is
no
textual
limit.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
--
yes.
yes,
there
is.
first,
with
respect
to
section
514,
it's
part
and
parcel
of
joining
berne,
and
berne
gives
protection
not
only
to
the
previously
created
works
but
to
newly
created
works,
and
it
creates
additional
economic
incentives
in
foreign
--
by
assuring
better
protection
in
foreign
countries
for
newly
created
works.
so
it
creates
many,
many
more
than
one
new
work.
and
i
think
it's
also
quite
reasonable,
justice
breyer,
to
read
the
incentive
structure
here
in
a
way
parallel
to
the
way
the
court
did
in
eldred,
which
is
to
say
that
just
as
in
eldred
the
court
assumed
that
there
was
an
implicit
guarantee
to
an
author
making
a
creation
that
that
author
would
get
the
benefit,
not
only
of
the
existing
term
of
copyright
but
any
extension,
i
think
here
with
respect
to
american
authors,
it's
an
implicit
guarantee
that
they
get
the
benefit
not
only
of
the
foreign
protection
in
existence
at
the
time,
but
any
expansion
of
foreign
protection
through
adjoining
treaties,
and
article
8
and
section
514
implementing
article
18
of
berne
is
the
price
of
admission
to
that
treaty--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
do
think
--
for
a
host
of
reasons.
one
is
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
just
not
so
simple,
and
an
--
i
think
the
question
that
i
think
your
honor
asked
my
friend
was
what
about
when
congress
expands
the
scope
of
exclusive
rights
for
existing
works?
well,
congress
has
done
that
many,
many
times,
and
musical
composition
is
a
really
good
example
of
that.
in
1831,
congress
created
exclusive
right
in
the
publishing
and
vending
of
musical
compositions,
but
not
in
their
public
performance.
so
from
1831
on,
once
i
bought
the
sheet
music,
their
--
public
performance
was
borrow
the
petitioner's
way
of
thinking
in
the
public
domain.
you
could
do
it
any
time
you
wanted
without
having
to
get
a
license
to
pay
any
money.
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
then
in
1897,
congress
granted
an
exclusive
right
in
the
public
performance
of
musical
compositions--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
made
it
applicable
to
all
existing
copyrights.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that
they
have
done
it
many
times
before
and
it's
a
process
--
i
think
it
reflects
--
and
--
and
the
point
is
no
one
has
thought
with
respect
to
any
of
those
significant
adjustments
of
the
boundaries
that
it
was
an
occasion
for
first
amendment
scrutiny.
and
i
think
that's
because
of
the
wisdom
of
the
court's
opinion
in
eldred,
that
these
are--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
--
because
i
think
there
is,
once
the
court
gets
into
the
business
of
first
amendment
analysis,
there
is
no
stopping
point,
because
all
of
the
adjustments
of
the
boundaries
could
have
the
same
kind
of
effect
i
think
as
the
musical
composition
--
show?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
what
copyright
does,
by
definition,
is
provide
exclusive
rights
in
expression;
and
so
if
the
first
amendment
is
triggered
whenever
copyright
provides
exclusive
rights
in
expression
that
it
didn't
used
to
provide,
then
heightened
scrutiny
will
apply
any
time
congress
exercises
its
copyright
power,
and
what
the
court
said
in
eldred--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
under
section
514
they
are
not
out
of
luck
because
it
has
significant
protections
and
accommodations
for
derivative
works.
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny,
we
think
eldred
answers,
that
--
that
first
the
copyright
clause
already
contains
very
significant
accommodations
of
first
amendment
interests.
the
idea/expression
dichotomy,
fair
use;
and
--
and
that
is
going
to
provide
--
maybe
--
maybe
jimmy
hendrix
could
claim
fair
use
in
that
situation.
and
those
are
at
the
core
of
the
traditional
contours
of
copyright.
so
if
congress
were
to
try
to
extinguish
fair
use,
i'd
say
yes,
we'd
have
a
first
amendment
issue
there.
if
congress
were
to
try
to
provide
exclusive
right
in
the
ideas
that
are
expressed,
as
opposed
to
the
expression
itself,
yes,
we
would
have
a
first
amendment
issue
there.
if
congress
were
to,
say,
use
the
copyright
power
to
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
don't
think
it
would
have
any
problem
passing
intermediate
scrutiny,
but
we
don't
think
intermediate
scrutiny
ought
to
apply.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
we
don't
say
it
doesn't
apply,
but
eldred.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
and
what
eldred
said,
as
i
read
it,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
unless
congress
alters
their
traditional
contours
of
copyright
then
ration
basis
scrutiny
rather
than
any
heightened
form
of
first
amendment
scrutiny
applies.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it
is
going
to
tip
the
balance,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
--
the
reason
congress
enacted
section
514
at
the
urging
of
executive
branch
officials
who
were
charged
with
trying
to
ensure
that
we
could
integrate
ourselves
into
the
international
system
of
copyright
protection
was
that
if
we
didn't
have
this
provision,
then
we
were
not
going
to
be
taken
seriously.
our
works
were
not
going
to
be
protected
in
these
foreign
countries,
and
that
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
joining
berne
in
the
first
place.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so
--
two
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
interest
in
what
foreign
countries
will
do,
i
think
it's
incorrect
to
assume
that
this
will
be
tit-for-tat,
that
if
we
don't
enforce
article
18,
the
only
thing
other
countries
won't
do
is
enforce
article
18
with
respect
to
our
works,
as
opposed
to
believing
that
we're
not
an
--
an
effective
partner
and
not
enforcing
their
copyright
laws
for
the
whole
purpose
of
our
works.
second,
justice
breyer,
that
problem
that
you
identified
just
exists
as
a
feature
of
copyright
law.
copyright
law
exists
for
a
certain
time.
with
respect
to
those
works,
it's
going
to
create
that
issue.
the
problem
here
is
just
the
result
of
a
fortuity
that
those
works
might
have
been
published
in
a
country
that
at
the
time
they
were
published
didn't
have
copyright
relations
with
the
united
states.
and
what
section
514
does
is
address
that
fortuity
by
putting
those
authors
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
been
in
had
their
country
had
copyright
relations
with
the
united
states.
so
i
don't
think
that's
a
principled
objection
on
a
constitutional
basis--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
it
doesn't
make
it
millions
of
times
worse.
it
applies
to
a
small
number
of
--
but
a
significant
number
of
countries--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
doubt
the
--
the
aggregate
number.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
reliance
parties,
that's
certainly
true.
they
would
have
to
give
notice.
it
is
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
that
if
you're
not
a
reliance
party,
then
there
would
be
an
infringement
even
without
notice,
so
i
do
think
there
is
something
on
that
point.
but
again,
i
just
think
that's
a
result
of
the
fortuity
of
the
countries
not
having
copyright
relations
with
the
united
states.
it's
not
about
the
--
it's
not
anything
integral
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
--
the
statute--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
i
don't
think
that
they
had
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
there
is
an
active
infringement
by
having
a
library
book
on
the
shelf,
and
of
course,
there
are
protections
for
libraries
built
into
the
copyright
act
in
all
events.
and
i
do
--
if
i
could
in
my
remaining
time,
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
history
that
we
started
with,
because
i
do
think
it
is
important
that
there
is
no
--
as
a
matter
of
text,
i
think
it's
clear
--
there
is
no
unyielding
requirement
that
you
cannot
restore
copyright
to
works
in
the
public
domain.
i
think
the
history
really
does
bear
that
out.
i
think
justice
sotomayor
had
the
history
exactly
right,
that
in
1790,
you
had
three
states
with
no
copyright
statutes.
of
the
10
states
with
copyright
statutes,
you
had
seven
that
did
not
provide
copyright
to
maps
and
charts,
which
the
federal
statute
did.
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
point:
of
the
states
that
did
enact
copyright
statutes
to
--
in
the
1780s
in
advance
of
the
1790
federal
act
--
at
least
four,
and
depending
on
how
you
counted
--
as
many
as
eight
provided
copyright
protection
only
to
works
printed
after
the
date
of
the
state
statute.
they
did
that
at
the
urging
of
the
continental
congress
in
1783.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
when
congress
enacted
the
copyright
act
of
1790,
it
made
a
conscious
choice
to
take
a
different
approach,
to
grant
copyright
protection
to
existing
works,
including
many,
many,
many
works
that
were
freely
available
for
exploitation
in
those
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito.
i
think
they
could
have
followed
the
model
nationally
of
prospective
copyright
only,
and
extinguishing
the
prior
copyright,
but
they
didn't
make
that
choice.
they
made
a
different
choice.
now,
my
friend
suggests
that
the
1790
act
was
just
a
transition,
but
of
course,
the
same
thing
is
really
true
in
an
important
sense
of
section
514.
it's
part
of
a
tradition
of
a
transition
of
the
united
states
into
the
international
system,
which
has
required
an
adjustment
of
our
rules
in
order
to
bring
us
into
conformity
with
the
international
system.
and
beyond
the
example
of
course
of
the
1790
--
and
by
the
way,
with
respect
to
that
language
in
the
1790
copyright
who
have
or
have
not
copyright,
that's
just
a
rerun
of
an
argument
that
the
court
rejected
in
wheaton
v.
peters.
in
wheaton,
the
court
said
that
--
that
language
in
the
1790
act
was
referring
to
pre-publication
common
law
copyright,
not
post-publication
common
law
copyright.
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
pretty
clear
that
what
that
language
is
referring
to
--
of
course,
congress
presupposes
the
existence
of
copyrights,
or
at
least
state
statutes
that
created
some
copyrights
--
but
what
congress
did
was
act
far
more
broadly.
and
--
so
i
do
think
--
and
then
when
one
looks
at
the
examples
of
patents
--
i
think
the
--
the
oliver
evans
example,
and
that
case,
is
an
important
example,
early
in
our
history.
congress
creates
a
new
patent
term
to
an
expired
patent.
president
jefferson
signs
it.
secretary
of
state
madison
issues
it.
chief
justice
marshall
upholds
it
as
a
circuit
justice,
and
the
court
upholds
it
against
a
charge
that
it's
impermissibly
burdening
people
who
act
in
reliance
on
the
expiration
of
the
prior
patent.
there
wasn't
a
word
in
this
court's
decision
in
that
case
about
any
potential
constitutional
infirmity
with
doing
that.
and
one
would
think
if
this
was
such
a
significant
and
viable
principle
of
constitutional
law,
that
someone
would
have
brought
it
up
in
those
cases.
in
fact,
the
striking
thing
about
reading
the
evans
decision
is
that
the
court
clearly
looks
at
this
all
as
a
matter
of
legislative
policy
judgment.
it
says,
you
know
yes,
you're
right,
it
might
have
been
an
argument,
a
good
argument
in
favor
of
creating
some
reliance
interest
here,
but
that's
a
judgment
congress
should
have
made
if
anybody
was
going
to
make
it.
it
didn't
--
and
there
is
no
reading
of
the
--
there
is
no
required
reading
of
that
statute
that
has
to
protect
the
reliance
party.
so
i
don't
--
i
just
think
when
you
look
at
the
patent
protection,
when
you
look
at
the
1790
act,
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
when
congress
expands
exclusive
rights,
as
it
did
for
example
with
respect
to
musical
compositions
but
did
in
the
1976
act
with
respect
to
lots
of
exclusive
rights,
it
does
so
with
existing
copyrights.
and
all
of
that
points
up
to
the
wisdom
of
what
this
court
said
in
eldred,
that
within
very
wide
margins,
these
are
matters
where
legislative
choice,
these
are
policy
calls
that
require
the
balancing
of
a
complex
set
of
interests,
the
drawing
of
a
complex
set
of
lines
made
even
more
complex
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
are
now
trying
to
make
a
transition
into
full
participation
in
an
international
system,
which
is
of
vital
importance
to
protecting
one
of
our
most
valuable
economic
exports,
intellectual
property.
thank
you.
