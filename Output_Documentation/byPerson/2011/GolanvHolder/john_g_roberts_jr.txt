chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-545,
golan
v.
holder.
mr.
falzone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
your
--
under
your
theory,
let's
say
you
have
a
copyright
that
expires
on
october
5th,
okay?
on
october
4th,
congress
could
extend
that
for
25
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
but
on
october
6th,
they
couldn't
go
back
and
extend
it
1
day.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
new
categories?
you
know,
architecture.
congress
decides
we're
going
to
extend
copyright
protection
to
architectural
design,
and
they
say
--
and
we
are
going
to
go
back
5
years,
so
any
new
architectural
design
conceived
or
constructed,
whatever,
within
the
last
5
years
gets
protection,
and
it
goes
on
for
another
15.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
know.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
just
trying
--
trying
--
i'm
trying
to
test
the
limit
of
your
public
domain
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
extend
to
new
categories
of
copyrightable
works?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one
way
it
could,
i
suppose,
is
that
it
shows
that
congress
is
interested
in
making
sure
that
american
authors
overseas
have
reciprocal
protection,
an
issue
that
could
come
out
in
a
variety
of
contexts.
and
if
i'm
sitting
there
writing
a
great
novel,
i
will
have
the
confidence
that
my
government
will
ensure
that
i
get
protection
when
it
becomes
a
bestseller
in
china;
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
an
incentive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
but
the
same
issue
can
come
up
again,
you
know,
whether
it's
in
the
area
of
formalities,
whatever.
there
may
be
another
problem
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
other
countries
and
our
country.
and
i
will
know
that
in
the
past,
the
united
states
has
taken
action
looking
out
for
--
for
the
interests
of
american
authors.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
incentive.
now,
it
may
be,
as
i
think
it
was
described
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
a
"meager"
incentive.
you
may
be
more
interested
in
other
protections.
but
it's
--
we
haven't
really
required
much
more
than
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
there
is
something
at
least
at
an
intuitive
level
appealing
about
mr.
falzone's
first
amendment
argument.
one
day
i
can
perform
shostakovich;
congress
does
something,
the
next
day
i
can't.
doesn't
that
present
a
serious
first
amendment
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
--
one
answer
is
that
congress
has
done
this
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
do
you
have
an
argument
other
than
they
have
done
this
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
pertinent
under
the
first
amendment
in
other
areas,
right?
it's
a
different
analysis
if
your
claim
is
the
government
should
open
up
a
park
as
a
public
forum,
than
if
it's
been
a
public
forum
for
200
years
and
the
government
decides
to
close
it
down.
maybe
they
can
do
it
but
it's
a
different
question.
so
why
isn't
this
a
different
question,
whether
they
can
extend
copyright
protection
that's
already
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
jimmy
hendrix,
right?
he
has
a
distinctive
rendition
of
the
national
anthem,
and
all
of
a
--
assuming
the
national
anthem
is
suddenly
entitled
to
copyright
protection
that
it
wasn't
before,
he
can't
do
that,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
is
just
out
of
luck?
and
that's
just
one
example
of
many,
where
you
take
existing
works
and
you
have
a
derivative
work
or
something
that
is
distinctive
to
you.
so
those
people
are
just
out
of
luck?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
under
--
even
under
rationale
basis
scrutiny,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
run
into
justice
breyer's
concern
that
the
government
interest
is
vanishingly
small
when
it
comes
to
promoting
progress
under
the
copyright
clause,
so
that
the
interest
weighed
on
the
other
side
of
the
--
the
restriction
of
free
speech
rights,
it's
hard
to
say
that
that's
necessarily
going
to
tip
the
balance
in
every
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
falzone,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
