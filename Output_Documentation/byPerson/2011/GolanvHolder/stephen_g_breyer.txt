justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
curious.
to
go
back
a
second,
i
thought
justice
sotomayor's
question
was,
imagine
smith
in
germany.
he
has
written
a
book.
it's
there,
already
exists,
but
it
has
no
copyright
protection
in
the
united
states.
so
after
this,
would
he
be
more
willing
to
send
it
to
the
united
states?
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
no.
the
reason
is
because
i
can
go
and
buy
a
copy
and
sell
it
in
the
united
states
even
without
this
law.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
that
the
question?
the
question
is,
now
that
smith
has
the
same
protection
in
the
united
states
that
germany
gave
him,
doesn't
that
give
him
an
incentive
to
send
his
book
to
the
u.s.?
in
thinking
about
that
one,
i
thought:
not
much,
because
i
can
go
buy
it
today
without
this
law
and
bring
it
to
the
united
states
and
sell
as
many
as
i
want.
nonetheless--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
don't
just
jump
on
my
answer
as
being
correct
if
it's
not.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
in
eldred
the
main
difference
is
that
in
eldred,
there
was
a
law
that
might,
at
least
in
principle,
have
elicited
a
new
book.
and
in
this
case,
by
definition,
there
is
no
benefit
given
to
anything
at
all
that
is
not
already
created.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
by
--
how
does
it
give
any
benefit
to
anything
because
it's
already
created.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
this
provision
do
that?
i
think
maybe
there
are
other
provisions,
but
i
thought
this
provision
is
talking
solely
about
books,
for
example,
that
are
already
created.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
not?
i
may
have
been
misreading,
it
but
i
certainly
got
that
out
of
like
42
briefs
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
oh.
okay.
well,
you
know,
as
you
also
know
from
the
42
briefs,
that
there
is
a
lot
of
argument
that
you
could
comply
in
other
ways
that
are
less
restrictive;
and
whether
that's
true
or
not,
is
that
--
there
what
you're
saying
is
--
if
i
parody
it,
it's
not
a
fair
reading
i'm
going
to
give
--
but
what
you're
saying
is
we
are,
here
have
a
law
which
says
that
libraries,
music
lovers,
book
buyers
will
either
pay
more
money
for
things
already
in
existence
or
will
simply
be
unable
to
get
them
if
they
are
orphans,
on
the
one
hand,
so
that
other
countries
will
impose
similar
kinds
of
restrictions
upon
their
music
lovers,
music
goers,
libraries
and
--
so
that
they
pay
more
for
our
works
that
are
already
in
restrict
--
that
are
already
produced,
or
simply
can't
use
them
because
they
can't
find
who
owns
them.
now
that's
in
parody
form,
for
succinctness.
what
i
think
the
argument
is
on
the
other
side--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
they
will
say,
no
copyright
law
--
with
your
exception
of
when
the
country
was
founded
--
no
copyright
law
has
served
that
kind
of
purpose.
that's
served
often
by
tariffs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
not
by
copyright
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
necessarily.
there
are
three
categories.
one
is
the
category
of
the
people
who
you
couldn't,
because
of
the
country;
that's
egypt,
i
think,
and
russia.
their
second
is
the
category
of
the
people
--
of
sound
recordings,
and
their
third
is
category
which
is
not
the
null
set,
of
people
who
did
not
comply
with
certain
registration
requirements.
for
example,
i
believe
that
the
widow
of
samuel
--
brittan
failed
to
renew
her
copyright,
and
there
are
probably
many
that
failed
to
renew
the
copyright
after
28
years,
and
the
reason
that
they
didn't
is
because
they
didn't
think
there
was
much
money
in
it,
and
those
are
the
very
works
that
the
libraries
want
to
get
ahold
of
and
put
in
their
databases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
for
one
text.
they
say
that
text
has
to
do
with
progress.
and
when
they
read
it
historically
in
light
of
macaulay,
in
light
of
the
statute
of
anne,
in
light
of
going
back
to
venice
and
the
copyrights,
in
light
of
going
back
to
letters
between
madison
and
jefferson
--
that
term
has
always
meant
produce
at
least
one
new
thing.
and
here
there
is
not
one
new
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
couldn't
have
been
that
--
it
must
be
somewhat
overstated,
mustn't
it?
because
the
only
concern
is
not
about
protecting
new
works
in
the
foreign
countries
--
the
concern
as
i
understand
it
was
that
we've
had
things
in
copyright
for
many
years,
and
we
want
retroactive
protection
there.
the
countries
that
didn't
give
it,
like
japan,
were
not
kicked
out
of
the
berne
convention.
rather,
we
pursued
them
in
the
wto
for
many
years,
and
i
guess
somebody
might
pursue
us
and
then
you
get
into
an
argument
about
whether
there
are
other
ways.
now,
is
that
strong
enough
to
overcome
what
these
briefs
are
full
of?
i'll
give
you
an
example.
save
the
music
is
charged
with
looking
for
jewish
music
in
the
periods
'30s,
'40s,
and
'50s.
other
organizations
might
find
a
treasure
trove
of
literature
that
was
--
that
was
copyrighted
in
czechoslovakia
or
in
warsaw,
and
they
want
to
put
it
on
the
web,
and
they
want
people
to
listen
to
it.
but
they
have
no
more
idea
of
how
to
track
down
the
person
on
that,
and
they
aren't
protected
by
any
notice
requirements
because
they
aren't
reliance
parties.
we're
told
by
barbara
springer,
former
registrar,
that
there
are
millions
of
such
instances
where
people
would
like
to
go
back
and
would
like
to
put
music
literature,
film,
et
cetera,
in
a
form
that
people
can
use
it
today
and
there
is
no
way
to
do
it
without
their
becoming
scofflaws,
or
without
their
having
millions
of
dollars
to
hire
infinite
numbers
of
trackers
and
lawyers.
now,
that's
the
argument
that's
made
on
the
other
side,
as
the
interest
in
communication
that's
important.
what
do
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right
here,
we
have
the
argument.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
general
problem.
it
may
be
diminished
in
the
united
states
but
it
still
exists.
and
i
guess
the
argument
here
is
well,
don't
make
it
millions
of
times
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
barbara
springer
said
a
million,
numbers
it
in
the
millions.
do
you
want
to
say
that's--
