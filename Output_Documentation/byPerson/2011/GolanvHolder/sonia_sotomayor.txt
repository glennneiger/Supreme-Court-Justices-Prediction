justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
was
no
limit
here,
meaning
these
foreign
works
were
never
given
the
opportunity
to
be
copyrighted.
isn't
that
a
substantial
difference
from
the
hypothetical
that
you're
trying
to
proffer?
you're
--
the
hypothetical
--
and
i
think
that's
what
justice
ginsburg
was
responding
to
--
is
you
had
a
copyright,
it
expired,
and
now
congress
wants
to
revive
it.
isn't
that
different
from
not
having
had
the
opportunity
at
all,
and
being
given
a
term
to
exploit
your
work
and
protect
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
i
know,
but
it
didn't
do
it
when
it
set
up
the
copyright
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
1790,
counsel,
there
were
three
states
that
didn't
give
copyrights.
there
were
other
states,
and
you
make
a
big
deal
in
your
brief
about
common
law
protection,
but
common
law
protection,
particularly
in
new
york,
which
you
relied
on,
only
extended
to
unpublished
works.
once
a
work
was
published,
it
was
no
longer
protected
under
the
common
law.
that
was
true
of
most
states.
and
some
states
gave
copyright
protection
to
residents
of
their
own
state
but
not
to
residents
from
other
states.
so
it
took
a
whole
body
of
public
works
and
gave
them
copyright
protection
the
day
they
decided
to
pass
the
copyright
law.
so
what
are
you
doing
telling
us
that
there
has
never
been
a
historical
experience
with
congress
taking
public
works
out
of
the
public
domain?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
read
those
words
to
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
to
have
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--your
reading
of
that
passage
is
different
than
mine.
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
saying
whether
you
have
or
you
haven't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
disagree
with
your
proposition,
does
your
argument
fail?
if
the
historical
work
does
not
point
to
what
you
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
1790.
if
congress
did
what
i
believe
it
did,
would
your
argument
fail?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
started
in
the
place
you
want
congress
to
have
started
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
said,
moving
forward,
there
is
a
federal
copyright.
it
didn't
have
to
take
things
out
of
the
public
domain.
we
are
arguing
about
whether
they
did
or
didn't.
but
assuming
they
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
there
are
some
foreign
authors
who
didn't
or
wouldn't
come
into
the
u.s.
market
because
they
couldn't
protect
their
works
here,
and
kept
their
works
in
other
markets
that
--
in
which
it
was
protected?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it
doesn't
encourage
them
to
sort
of
make
investments?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
not?
foreign
authors
who
decided
not
to
exploit
their
works
here
wouldn't
be
induced
to
think
about
coming
into
this
market
because
now
they
can
protect
their
works?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
not
answering
my
question.
you
don't
think
that
this
law
induces
those
foreign
authors
to
come
here
and
promote
their
work?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
it
might
be
his
incentive
to
buy
it
or
not,
but
the
question
is
the
author's
incentive
to
sell
it
here.
those
are
two
different
incentives.
whether
--
you
know,
he
could
go
anywhere
and
buy
a
cheaper
book
if
he
chose
to
take
the
trip
or
get
on
the
internet
and
find
it.
he
could
do
that
now.
copyrighted
materials
here
go
at
a
different
price
than
they
do
elsewhere.
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
the
author's
incentive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
you
can't
incentivize
them,
they
are
not
going
to
claim
their
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
are
not
going
to
come
and
claim
their
rights.
part
of
this
law
is
that
they
have
to
declare
that
they
are
interested
in
protecting
their
copyright
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
optional
for
them;
but
if
they
do,
that's
when
they
can
sue
a
prior
user.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
limit
that
you're
referring
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
said
there
are
limits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--marbury
--
the
davis
law
was
passed.
had
to
go
and
pick
out
all
the
books
it
had
that
were
subject
to
copyright
and
throw
them
out,
or
do
what
with
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
stop
them
from
circulation?
i'm
not
sure
--
how
would
they
protect
themselves
from
infringement?
