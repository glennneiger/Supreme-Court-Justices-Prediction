justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
congress
can
set
a
time
limit.
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with,
let's
say,
aaron
copeland,
who
gets
the
benefit
of
copyright,
and
congress
says:
no,
we
think
shostakovich
should
be
treated
just
like
copeland.
yes,
we
took
care
of
our
own
when
we
weren't
part
of
the
world
community,
but
now
we
are.
and
so
all
that
congress
is
doing
is
giving
shostakovich
works
the
same
limited
work
as
aaron
copeland.
and
why
does
that
violate
the
limited-time
prescription?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
person
--
the
person
we
are
talking
about,
the
work
we
are
talking
about,
never
got
the
first
limit.
there
was
no,
there
was
no
time,
there
was
no
time
when
that
work
could
have
been
protected.
so
why
isn't
it
consistent
with
the
copyright
clause
to
say,
you
are
entitled
to
limited
time
protection?
we
are
not
talking
about
a
case
where
you've
had
the
protection,
enjoyed
it
and
then
it
expired,
and
then
congress
says:
we'd
like
--
we
like
your
work
so
much,
we
are
going
to
give
you
another
term.
what's
affected
here
are
people
who
were
unprotected.
and
congress
says
we
think
that
they
should
have
a
limited
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
get
the
equivalent
of
what
a
u.s.
author
--
but
let's
take
the
large
category,
because
it's
the
ones
that
you
feature.
we
are
talking
about
shostakovich,
stravinski,
and
i
say:
well,
what's
wrong
with
giving
them
the
same
time
that
aaron
copeland
got?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
a
limited
time.
that's
saying
you
have
no
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
has
to
have
a
beginning,
too.
and
for
these
people
who
were
unprotected,
because
we
didn't
recognize
their
copyright,
there
is
no
beginning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
the
public
domain
is
untouchable.
i'm
not
sure
i
get
that
from
the
constitution,
that
says
to
secure
to
authors
for
a
limited
time
the
exclusive
right.
that
--
that's
talking
about
what
you
can
secure
to
authors,
so
i
don't
see
why
using
the
words
of
the
constitution
"to
secure
to
authors
for
a
limited
time.
"
congress
can't
say:
we
want
every
author
to
have
a
limited
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
foreign
works
that
we
didn't
give,
we're
not
treating
them
any
better.
they
don't
get
a
different
startup
date,
but
they
get
the
same
end
date
as
our
own
authors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
not
talking
about
expiration
dates.
so
i'd
like
you
to
concentrate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
--
that's
not
--
none
of
these
--
none
of
these
copyrights
have
been
extended
beyond
their
expiration
date.
they
just
weren't
protected.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
--
that
is
not
--
that
is
most
distinctly
not
before
this
case,
so
please
let's
not
talk
about
a
copyright
that
has
been
protected,
has
expired,
and
congress
wants
to
revive
it.
we
are
concentrating
on
what
congress
did
to
bring
us
into
compliance
with
the
worldwide
system
and
it's
saying:
we
are
giving
a
limited
time
to
these
authors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
never
had
a
limited
time
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
anyone
in
the
same
--
the
same
--
published
the
same
year
as
de
tocqueville,
a
u.s.
author,
that
would
have
a
copyright
protection
today?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
gave
the
example
of
aaron
copeland
versus
shostakovich.
let's
go
back
to
de
tocqueville.
who
has
a
copyright
who
published
in
what,
18
--
what
was
it
--
40s?
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
gave
an
analogy
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
i
thought
you
were
quite
right
about
that.
you
can
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
before
it's
expired,
but
once
it's
expired
it's
over.
the
problem
with
using
that
as
an
analogy
is
that
there
was
a
beginning.
time
ran
out,
and
you're
trying
to
deal
with
a
situation
here
where
you
say,
you
know,
the
time
was
limited
for
the
u.s.
work,
but
it's
unlimited;
you
--
you
cannot
treat
the
foreign
work
--
you
cannot
give
it
a
limited
time,
the
same
limited
time
that
you
would
give
a
u.s.
work.
you're
saying
these
people
had
no
time
and
they
may
never
have
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't
quite
so,
because
there
are
these
examples
of
people
who
couldn't
get
copyright
because
of
wartime
after
both
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii,
and
--
so
those
people
were
allowed
to
get
the
protection
that
they
couldn't
get
because
of
the
war.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
presupposing
that
they
are
all
going
to
give
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
time
we
joined
berne,
there
was
an
appreciation
that
we
deferred
the
article
18
issue.
there
wasn't
any
--
anyone
who
said
that
we
satisfied
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
there
were
many
people
who
read
article
18
in
a
different
way
and
congress
was
later
persuaded
that
that
was
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
--
they
found
that
compliance
with
article
18
was
appropriate
for
us
to
become
a
full
member
of
the
international
copyright
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
this
rides
on
accepting
your
argument
that
zero
is
a
limited
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
it
was
would
required
by
trips?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
do
not
solve
them
if
we
don't
come
ply
with
berne
18,
and
we
are
subject
to
being
sanctioned
by
some
world
trade
organization?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
golan
v.
holder,
no.
10-545.
the
berne
convention
for
the
protection
of
literary
and
artistic
works,
established
in
1886,
is
the
principal
accord
governing
international
copyright
relations.
berne's
164
member
states
agreed
to
provide
a
minimum
level
of
copyright
protection
and
to
treat
authors
from
other
member
countries
as
well
as
they
treat
their
own.
of
central
importance
in
this
case,
berne's
article
18
requires
countries
to
protect
existing
foreign
works
whose
term
of
protection
has
not
yet
expired
either
in
the
country
of
origin
or
the
country
where
protection
is
claimed.
the
united
states
finally
joined
berne
in
1989,
but
initially
deferred
compliance
with
article
18.
in
the
following
years,
other
berne
members
objected
to
our
incomplete
adherence,
some
refused
to
protect
existing
u.s.
works,
others
threatened
enforcement
by
recourse
to
the
then
new
world
trade
organization.
in
1994,
congress
put
to
rest
any
question
about
u.s.
compliance
with
article
18.
section
514
of
the
uruguay
round
agreements
act
extended
a
copyright
protection
to
foreign
works
that
enjoyed
protection
in
their
country
of
origin,
but
not
the
u.s.
protection
for
any
of
three
reasons.
the
country
of
origin
had
not
maintained
copyright
relations
with
the
united
states,
the
work
was
a
pre-1972
sound
recording
or
the
author
failed
to
comply
with
u.s.
statutory
formalities.
under
section
514,
the
foreign
works
term
of
protection
expires
at
precisely
the
time
it
would
have
expired
had
the
work
enjoyed
u.s.
protection
from
the
outset.
these
newly
protected
works
previously
were
part
of
the
u.s.
public
domain
which
means
they
had
been
freely
available
for
use
with
no
need
for
permission
from
the
author
or
copyright
owner.
to
cushion
the
impact
of
the
works'
transition
to
protect
this
status,
congress
provided
accommodations
for
those
who
have
previously
used
the
foreign
works.
petitioners
are
musicians,
conductors,
publishers
and
others
who
formally
enjoyed
free
access
to
works
514
removed
from
the
public
domain.
they
maintain
that
section
514
is
invalid
under
both
constitution's
copyright
clause
and
the
first
amendment.
because
the
works
previously
entered
the
public
domain,
they
assert,
they
must
forever
remain
there.
the
tenth
circuit
rejected
this
narrow
view
of
congress'
copyright
authority
and
so
do
we.
the
copyright
clause
does
not
place
beyond
congress'
reach
works
that
never
enjoyed
u.s.
copyright
protection
or
enter
the
public
domain
prematurely.
neither
congressional
practice
nor
our
decisions
treat
the
public
domain
in
any
and
all
cases
as
untouchable
by
copyright
legislation.
the
first
amendment
likewise
provides
no
exceptional
solicitude
for
works
in
the
public
domain.
as
we
held
in
2003
in
eldred
v.
ashcroft,
copyright
law's
built-in
safe
guard
for
free
expression,
the
fair
use
doctrine
and
the
idea
expression
dichotomy
generally
accommodate
a
speaker's
right
to
free
expression
regarding
copyrighted
works.
section
514
respects
both
limits.
the
provision
simply
brings
certain
foreign
works
under
the
very
same
legal
regime
that
applies
to
domestic
and
most
of
the
foreign
works.
that
alignment
does
not
unconstitutionally
abridge
free
speech.
in
sum,
we
are
satisfied
that
neither
the
copyright
clause
nor
the
first
amendment
bars
the
unstinting
adherence
congress
gave
to
the
berne
convention.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
alito
has
joined.
