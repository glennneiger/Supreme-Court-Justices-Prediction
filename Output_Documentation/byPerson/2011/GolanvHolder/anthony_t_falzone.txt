mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
514
did
something
unprecedented
in
american
copyright
law.
it
took
millions
of
works
out
of
the
public
domain,
where
they
had
remained
for
decades
as
the
common
property
of
all
americans.
that
violated
the
copyright
clause
and
the
first
amendment.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
copyright
clause.
in
eldred,
this
court
held
congress
gets
to
pick
the
date
on
which
a
copyright
expires,
and
it
can
extend
that
date
before
we
reach
that
date.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
the
problem
is
congress
is
now
setting
a
second
limit
long
after
the
first
one
has
come
and
gone.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
so
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing.
many
of
the
works
that
were
restored
here
did
get
some
time,
28
years,
and
were
not
renewed.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question
about
the
works
that
got
none--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--congress
has
been
setting
the
limited
time
at
zero
since
1790.
in
the
1790
act,
congress
set
the
limit
at
zero
for
a
wide
array
of
works,
those
that
did
not
comply
with
formalities,
those
that
were
written
by
foreign
authors--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
but
saying
you
have
no
time
is
itself
picking
the
limit
because
the
language
of
the
copyright
clause
forces
congress
to
pick
a
limit
that
constraints
copyright
by
marking
its
end.
and
when
--
if
a
limit
does
not
mark
the
end
once
reached,
then
there
is
no
limit,
there
is
no
end.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no,
there
does
not
need
to
be
a
beginning.
it
is
within
congress's
discretion.
remember,
this
is
permissive.
congress
may
grant
exclusive
rights,
but
it
can
also
say
your
limit
is
going
to
be
zero,
we
decide
that
you're
not
going
to
get
any
exclusive
rights.
every
congress
since
1790,
every
time
it
went
to
add
subject
matter,
every
time
it
went
to
extend
the
duration
of
copyright,
respected
that
choice
to
give
no
time.
and
in
fact,
the
time
--
the
decision
to
make
foreign
authors
ineligible
is
a
decision
that
congress
has
never
gone
back
on.
none
of
the
exceptions
the
government
points
to
remove
anything
from
the
public
domain
that
was
placed
there
based
upon
a
lack
of
national
eligibility.
200
years
of
history
is
crystal
clear
about--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--right.
the
--
the
operative
language
is
the
limited
times
restriction,
and
the
limit
it
requires
congress
to
pick
is
the
date
at
which
all
protection
ends
for
good,
and
congress
has
picked
zero
since
1790,
and
respected
that
decision,
and
that
is
no
accident.
because
the
--
the
--
if
--
if
you
want
to
know
what
limited
times
means,
if
it
means
anything
it
means
if,
for
instance
if
congress
is
not
required
to
respect
an
expiration
date
long
after
it's
passed,
or
its
decision
to
deny
a
work
any
protection
in
the
first
place--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--sure.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
well,
taking
works
that
got
no
protection
--
if
congress
is
not
required
to
respect
its
decision
to
deny
a
work
any
protection
in
the
first
place,
we
can
never
know
whether
we've
reached
the
end
or
not.
and
in
fact
that's
the
problem
with
the
government's
theory.
its
theory
says
all
congress
has
to
do
is
attach
a
nominal
expiration
date
to
any
given
copyright.
well,
if
that's
true,
there
is
--
if
that's
all
you
need,
there
is
nothing
stopping
us
from
reaching
back
de
tocqueville
100
years.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
well--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
i
--
i
was
talking
--
de
tocqueville
never
got
any
time,
because
he
was
a
foreign
author.
ben
johnson
never
got
any
time,
but
on
the
government's
theory
we
could
give
him
100
years
right
now.
this
statute
did
work
differently.
it
certainly
restored
copyrights
into
the
existing
period.
that's
correct.
that
is
an
accurate
description
of
this
statute.
but
that
is
not
a
limit
that's
contained
anywhere
in
the
government's
interpretation
of
limited
times.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
the
answer
is
nobody.
but
here
is
the
problem.
if
congress
wanted
to
reach
that
work,
here's
all
it
has
to
do
on
the
government's
theory,
and
even
under
the
mechanism
of
section
514.
all
it
needs
to
do
today
is
extend
existing
terms
100
years,
and
then
reach
back
and
restore
into
that
existing
term.
so
on
the
government's
theory
and
even
by
the
mechanism
on
which
this
statute
operates,
the
government
could
reach
back
and
protect
de
tocqueville.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
yes.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
that's
exactly
right,
because
the
limit
the
copyright
clause
requires
us
to
pick
is
an
end
date
with
permanent
consequence.
end
dates
are
about
finality.
if
that
end
date
doesn't
have
permanent
consequence,
if
it
doesn't
have
finality,
we
can
never
know
if
we've
reached
the
end
or
not.
the
limit
the
framers
knew
was
the
limit
of
the
statute
of
anne.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
in
eldred?
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no,
no.
eldred
said
congress
can
move
the
limit
back
we
reach
it.
but
eldred
most
certainly
did
not
say
that
congress
is
free
to
ignore
the
limit
once
we
hit
it,
because
if
you
can
do
that
then
you
never
know
if
you've
reached
the
limit
or
not.
the
limit
the
framers
knew
was
the
one
in
the--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--the
answer
is
no,
it's
not
different;
and
congress
treated
those
situations
exactly
the
same
in
all
19
amendments
over
the
span
of
200
years.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
it
gave
equal
respect.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
oh,
it
did.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
well,
let
me
be
clear
about
what
happened
in
1790.
the
1790
act
did
not
remove
anything
from
the
public
domain.
the
text
is
clear,
because
insofar
as
applied
to
works
already
printed,
it
presupposes
existing
copyrights
explicitly
in
the
text
of
the
act.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
so
--
i'm
looking
at
section
1
of
the
1790
act,
and
at
--
at
the
beginning
it
talks
about:
"after
the
passing
of
this
act,
the
author
and
authors
of
any
map,
chart,
book
or
books
already
printed
within
these
united
states,
being
a
citizen
thereof
or
resident
within,
or
his
or
her
executors,
administrators
or
assigns,
who
have
or
have
not
transferred
to
any
other
person
the
copyright
of
such
map,
chart,
book
or
books--
"
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--you
do
have
to
have
a
copyright.
so
it
says
"author
or
authors"
and
"have"
is
the
singular
and
have
--
"have
not"
is
the
plural
for
that.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
sure.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
right.
the
copyright
of
such
map.
it
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
copyright.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
yes.
"the
copyright"
is
the
key
language.
so
the
text
makes
it
clear
they
presupposed
existing
copyrights.
and
let
me
speak
to--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--but
let
me
speak
to
the
point
you
raised
about
common
law
protection
for
published
works.
you
said
new
york
provided
no
common
law
protection
for
published
works.
with
respect,
that's
not
correct.
the
naxos
v.
capitol
records
case,
the
highest
court
of
new
york,
says
new
york
common
law
provided
protection
for
published
works
right
up
to
the
point
where
the
federal
act
cut
it
off.
and
if
you
look
--
and
if
--
if
the
question
is
whether
the
first
congress
intended
to
take
anything
out
of
the
public
domain
in
1790,
the
answer
is
you
simply
cannot
reach
that
conclusion,
because
everything
contemporaneous
with
the
first
congress,
the
history
of
the
common
law
in
britain,
decided
by
millar
v.
taylor
and
donaldson
v.
beckett,
recognized
common
law
rights
in
published
works.
the
federalist
papers
spoke
about
millar,
and
everything
contemporaneous--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--you
mean
the
1790
act
or
the
19
after
it?
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no,
i
--
no.
not
necessarily,
because
of
course
that
was
the
first
copyright
act
and
congress
established
a
baseline.
it
had
to
start
somewhere.
what
we
see
19--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
no,
but
then--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--oh,
i
will
assume
they
did.
they
had
to
start
somewhere.
they
wanted
uniformity.
they
created
a
statute
that
provided
it.
when
you
look
at
every
amendment,
19
times
in
200
years
after
that,
congress
respected
the
permanent
consequence
of
the
limits
it
chose,
even
when
those
limits
were
a
work
gets
no
time
whatsoever,
based
on
formality
and
noncompliance,
based
upon
national
eligibility,
based
upon
expiration
of
28
years.
it
was
consistent
each
time
it
added
subject
matter,
extended
terms,
and--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
so
to
be
precise,
our
position
is
once
congress
calls
the
limit,
that
is,
once
it
says
this
work
is
unprotected,
whether
it's
the
expiration
of
28
years
or
a
decision
to
give
it
no
protection,
it's
creating
affirmative
rights
in
every
member
of
the
public.
yes,
they
own
it,
and
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well
--
in
--
in
this
case,
when
i
refer
to
the
public
domain,
it's
the
collection
of
things
for
which
congress
had
said
protection
is
done,
it's
over,
we've
hit
the
limit,
it's
done.
so
things
that
went--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--i
--
i
think
that's
the
operative
concept
here.
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
they
had
no
time
because
congress
decided
that
their
works
were
going
to
be
ineligible,
and
a
limit
of
zero
is
one
congress
has
been
setting
since
1790,
and
respected
consistently.
if
the
chief
justice
gives
me
a
limited
time
for
oral
argument,
i
might
say
no
thanks,
i
have
nothing
to
say.
and
we
all
know
i
can't
come
back
tomorrow.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
that's
correct.
that's
what
those
statutes
did.
they
were
never
challenged.
and
make
no
mistake,
our
position
is,
insofar
as
they
removed
anything
from
the
public
domain,
they
are
unconstitutional.
but
even
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
go
that
far,
i
think
the
wartime
statutes
and
the
other
small
handful
of
exceptions
the
government
points
to
fit
quite
well
into
a
very
limited
exception
for
eligible
authors
who
show
nothing
more
than
the
familiar
concept
of
excusable
neglect,
which
has
operated
--
again,
in
very
narrow
situations
--
to
relieve
people
of
the
consequences
of
deadlines.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
right.
so
--
so
--
of
course,
to
be
clear,
that's
not
what
congress
actually
did
when
it
protected
architectural
works.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
it
looked
forward,
right.
but
that
--
so
in
that
case,
the
--
the
federal
scheme,
if
it
had
not
previously
regulated
architectural
works,
it
had
not
--
there
had
been
no
decision
as
to
what
the
limit
was
going
to
be,
so
you
may
pose
a
different
question.
here,
we
are
talking
about
works
that
were
affirm
--
affirmatively
within
the
federal
scheme--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--sure.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
i
think
the
answer
is
the
retrospective
portion
of
that
statute
flunks
progress
of
science
but
--
but
passes
limited
times.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
so
--
the
--
the
progress
of
science
corresponds
roughly
to
the
creation
and
spread
of
knowledge
and
learning.
a
statute
that
does
nothing,
like
this
one,
does
nothing
but
take
old
works
out
of
the
public
domain
without
any
impact
on
prospective
incentives,
cannot
stimulate
the
creation
of
anything.
and
as
for
things
that
already
exists,
it
cannot
stimulate
the
spread
of
them.
all
it
can
do
is
restrict
the
spread
of
things
that
could
warrant--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--no.
this
statute
does
not
and
cannot
do
that,
because--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well,
whether
they
came
into
this
market
or
not
has
no
effect
on
whether
they
can
protect
their
works
or
not.
they
were
unprotected
whether
they
came
into
this
market
or
not.
they
would
be
protected--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
it
could.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
yes.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
yes.
and
you
were
assured
of
that
incentive
in
1988,
when
we
joined
the
berne
convention
without
removing
anything
from
the
public
domain,
because
when
you
sit
down
to
write
that
book
today,
that
work
will
absolutely
be
protected
in
all
of
the
berne
and
wto
countries.
so
the
incentive
effect
was
achieved
and
achieved
in
full--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--that's--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--perhaps.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
--
in
--
in
the
record
before
congress
here
to
reflect
the
fact
they
made
any
such
conclusion.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
potentially,
but
the
problem
here,
if
i
can
move
a
little
bit
to
the
first
amendment,
is
the
mechanism
congress
chose
to
use
here.
they
chose
to
create
that
reward
by
taking
away
core
public
speech
rights
from
the
american
public,
and
transforming
them
into
somebody's
private
property--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--well
--
but
let
me
focus
on
the
first
amendment
problem.
an
ordinary
copyright
statute
does
not
revoke
the
public's
federal
right
to
copy
and
use
works
in
the
public
domain.
that
is
exactly
the
thing
congress
refused
to
do
19
times
over
200
years.
and
that's
the
huge
departure
from
traditional
contours
of
copyright
protection
that
triggers
first
amendment
scrutiny
here.
and
when
you
go
to
ask
the
first
amendment
question,
you
can't
ignore
the
mechanism
congress
chose
to
use
here,
which
is
to
take
away
public
speech
rights,
and
turn
them
into
somebody
else's
private
property.
that
was
the
explicit
motivation
of
--
of
the
people
who
came
before
congress
and
asked
them
to
pass
this
statute.
that
is
the
justification
the
government--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--in
that
case,
i
misspoke.
the
public
--
the
public
domain
is
owned
collectively
by
the
public,
and
in
fact,
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
to
the
19th
century
refer
to
it
as
public
property.
and
i
think--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--i
think
--
i
think
that
it
could
possibly
incentivize
him
to
bring
it
over
to
the
united
states,
depending
on
how
the
statute
worked.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no,
i
think
you're
correct.
i
think
you're
correct.
i
think
that's--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--the
--
the
--
the
problem
here
is
these
authors
are
long
gone.
you
can't
incentivize
them.
these
works
are
so
old
they
are
long
gone.
you
can't
incentivize
anything
that's
happened
so
long
ago.
if
you
could--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no.
actually,
that's
optional.
it's
optional
for
them
to
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
enforce.
it's
optional
for
them
to
declare.
but
the
real
problem
is--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--that's
right.
it
--
well,
it
depends
who
they
want
to
sue,
but
yes.
they
certainly
have
broader
rights
once
they
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
enforce.
but
that--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--that's
right.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
it's
not
going
to
incentivize
anybody
to
create
anything,
and
it
only
restricts
the
circulation
of
things
that
once
circulated
freely.
if
i
can
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal,
i'd
like
to
do
that.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
thank
you.
i
have
--
i
have
four
points
to
make.
first
one
refusing
to
provide
any
protection
for
a
work
is
setting
the
term
at
zero.
the
point
of
the
limited
times
restriction
is
it
--
excuse
me
--
it
forces
congress
to
tell
us
when
the
end
has
come,
and
if
congress
is
forever
free
to
change
its
mind,
then
we
can
never
know
if
the
end
has
come.
point
number
two,
this
statute
does
not
and
cannot
promote
progress,
that
is,
the
creation
and
spread
of
knowledge
and
learning.
when
we
joined
berne
in
1988
we
got
all
of
its
prospective
benefits,
or
as
the
government
put
it,
secured
the
highest
available
level
of
multilateral
copyright
protection
for
u.s.
artists,
authors
and
their
creators.
this
statute
is
not
about
that.
it's
simply
about
rewarding
people
who
made
things
long
ago.
it's--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--no.
there
was
an
express
finding
--
explicit
finding
written
into
the
statute,
that
--
and
congress
found
explicitly
that
we
could
comply
with
all
berne
obligations
without
removing
anything
from
the
public
domain.
now,
third
point--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--congress
never
revisited
that
finding.
so
no;
they
found
what
they
found
in
1988,
and
they
never
revisited
it.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
congress
did
not
make
that
finding,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
even
glean
that
from
the
testimony
that
was
presented
to
congress.
the
problem
here
is
--
the
--
the
--
the
right
to
use
works
in
the
public
domain
has
defined
the
freedom
of
speech
that
the
public
has
known
since
1790.
the
1790
act
made
these
freedoms
clear
by
placing
works
unambiguously
and
clearly
in
the
public
domain,
including
all
foreign
works.
so
even
since
before
we
had
a
first
amendment,
that
has
defined
the
freedom
of
speech
that
the
public
knew.
and
that
right
has
also
made
sure
that
the
copyright
sequence
provides
ever-increasing
protection
for
public
speech
rights.
it
gives
partial
protection
for
some
public
speech
interests
during
any
initial
period
of
protection,
but
that
blossoms
into
complete
protection
for
all
public
speech
interests,
once
we
reach
the
limit
congress
picks,
once
they
place
the
work
in
the
public
domain.
the
burden
on
speech
that
this
statute
imposes
is
remarkable.
let's
start
with
the
performance
right,
which
is
central
to
my
clients.
there
can't
be
any
doubt,
as
i
think
chief
justice
roberts
got
at,
that
the
performance
has
a
huge
amount
of
original
expression
bound
up
in
it.
it's
the
reason
it's
different
to
see
king
lear
at
the
royal
shakespeare
company;
it's
the
reason
it's
different
when
john
coltrane
plays
a
jazz
standard.
hume
amount
of
expression.
but
even
if
you
put
performances
aside,
this
court
has
recognized
in
case
after
case
that
there
is
a
critical
speech
interest
in
publishing
the
work
of
another
author,
in
showing
a
film
created
by
another,
or
for
that
matter
performing
the
work
of
another,
so
that
the
burden
here
is
it
took
speech
rights
of
250
million
americans
and
turned
them
into
the
private
property
of
foreign
authors,
all
on
the
bare
possibility
that
might
put
more
money
in
the
pocket
of
some
u.s.
authors.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no.
not
on
the
first
amendment
side.
not
at
all.
that
is
--
the
first
amendment
argument
is
completely
independent
of
that.
even
if
you
find
congress
could
do
this
on
the
copyright
clause,
we
still
have
that
first
amendment
problem,
and
the
--
there
is
no
way
the
government
can
pass
intermediate
scrutiny
here.
this
was
not
required
by
berne.
the
government
does
not
even
contend
section
514
was
required
by
berne,
nor
could
it,
because
that
would
violate
congress's
explicit
findings
they
made
in
1988.
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
no.
because
trips
just
implements
berne.
so
that
the
problem
here
is
this
statute
was
not
passed--
mr.
anthony
t.
falzone
--there
was
very
vague
testimony
about
the
unsupported
possibility
that
could
happen,
and
that's
why
the
government
falls
back
on
this
interest
of
avoiding
a
dispute.
here
is
the
problem.
if
the
government
can
get
around
first
amendment
limits
by
signing
a
treaty,
and
then
the
flexibility
to
take
away
public
speech
rights
is
defined
by
some
complaint
proffered
by
some
treaty
partner,
then
the
first
amendment
is
defined
only
by
the
perceptions,
the
complaints
and
frankly
the
imagination
of
foreign
countries.
that
can't
be
the
way
it
works.
