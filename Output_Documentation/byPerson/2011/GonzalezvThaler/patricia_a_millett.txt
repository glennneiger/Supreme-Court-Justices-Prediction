ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
appeal,
but
in
doing
so
it
decided
the
case
wrongly.
mr.
gonzalez's
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
timely
because
it
was
filed
within
a
year
of
the
conclusion
of
direct
appellate
proceedings
in
the
state
court,
and
at
the
--
within
a
year
of
that
court's
ending
of
his
appeal
process.
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
existed
because
a
certificate
of
appealability
was
issued.
it
rested
upon
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
to
be
sure,
the
judge
in
issuing
that
certificate
did
not
identify
the
substantial
constitutional
question
required
by
2253(c)(3).
that
is
a
requirement.
it
is
mandatory,
but
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
it
does.
once
--
this
is
a
gatekeeping
function
to
identify
which
case,
which
appeal
should
go
forward
and
claim
the
attention
of
the
court.
but
the
text
of
the
statute
and
22
--
that's
on
page
--
excuse
me
--
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
it
provides
that
an
appeal
may
not
go
forward
and
the
certificate
of
appealability
may
go
forward.
the
operative
language
here
in
(c)(1)
is
that
this
is
about
an
appeal
going
forward.
so
once
the
certificate
identifies
issues,
the
appeal
goes
forward.
it's
much
like
1292(b),
where
certification
of
questions
comes
to
an
appellate
court,
and
they
decide
whether
to
take
interlocutory
review.
once
they
do,
they
are
not
bound
to
just
those
questions.
the
entire
order
comes
up
for
review.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
--
it
works
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
bar
to
going
forward.
it
is
a
violation
of
(c)(3).
if
timely
raised
by
the
state,
then
it
can
either
be
dismissed
or
revisited
by
the
original
judge.
an
appeal
from
the
authorizing
judge--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
court
so
held--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
this
court
held
in
miller-el--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
i
don't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
agree
that
the
so-called
content
validity
of
a
document
that
is
post
hoc
certifying
a
gatekeeping
requirement
is
itself
jurisdictional,
because
there
is
a--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
a
warrant
may
well
not
be
valid
if
it
doesn't--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
the
certificate
of
appealability
is
invalid
is
matter
of
law
here.
it's
an
incorrect
--
it's
an
incorrect
action
by
the
court.
that
doesn't
make
it
jurisdictional.
warrants
aren't
jurisdictional,
either,
in
that
sense.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
still
jurisdiction
to
take
the
appeal.
of
course,
one
would
expect
--
one
would
expect
either
the
court
of
appeals
judges
or
the
state,
which
--
both
of
which
have
every
incentive
to
check
on
these
things,
to
raise
the
issue.
but
the
question
is
--
when
something
happens--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
i
think
it--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there's
more
to
it.
i
mean,
it's
not
issued
by
a
clerk's
office,
right?
the
statute
requires
a
judge
to
do
this,
a
federal
judge,
circuit
judge
or
justice
--
circuit
justice
--
to
issue
this.
and
these
are
--
these
are
officials
who
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
law
and
the
constitution.
and
when
they
do
this,
when
they
make
these
determinations,
they
aren't
handing
these
out
like
candy;
they
are
deciding
that
their
court,
their
colleagues,
maybe
themselves,
should
invest
resources
in
this
process.
so
the
fact
that
a
certificate
is
issued
is
not
simply
a
piece
of
paper
coming
out.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
it
is
a
deliberate
determination
by
a
judicial
officer.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
my
position
would
be
harder
for
precisely
the
reason
you
phrased.
and
as
justice
scalia
was
asking,
how
do
we
tell?
these
are
--
these
are
jobs
of
statutory
construction,
and
the
fact
that
congress
broke
these
two
steps
out
and
broke
(c)(3)
out
by
itself,
and
there
is
a
noticeable
turn
in
the
language
by
the
time
you
get
to
(c)(3)
--
(c)(1)
says
"no
appeal
shall
be
taken".
that
sounds
jurisdictional.
(c)(3)
says
"a
document
shall
indicate
issues
after
the
fact.
"
the
important
thing
to
understand
here
is
that
you
not
only
have
the
language
shifting
materially,
but
you're
starting
presumption,
the
starting
presumption
here,
is
that
we
need
a
clear
direction
from
congress
before
we
decide
that
something
is
jurisdictional.
and
this
court
has
faced
language
than
(c)(3).
for
example,
in
reed--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
is
jurisdiction
to
consider.
it's
obviously
within
the
discretion
of
the
court.
they
could
also
determine
not
to.
and
i
say
that
again
because
the
language
talks
--
far
more
emphatic--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it
wouldn't.
it
would
not
be
obligated
to,
because
what
(c)(1)
says
is
this
determines
when
an
appeal
comes
forward,
the
whole
appeal
comes
forward.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
i
think
--
i
think
whether
you
have
to
--
the
panel
would
then
have
to
do
the
paperwork
of
doing
a
new
certificate
of
appealability.
adjusting
its
own
decision
in
the
course
of
its
ruling,
explain
that
we've
decided
to
reach
these
is
not,
i
don't
think,
of
jurisdictional
significance,
which--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
it's
a
statutory
construction
question,
but
congress--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
that
way,
but
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
tell
courts
that
an
appeal
comes
forward
but
we
are
only
going
to
allow
you
to
look
at
this
precise
issue
decided
by
one
judge.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
nowhere--
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
i
read
that
as
saying
you
--
we
are
going
to
have
an
appeal,
but
just
an
appeal
on
the
issue
that's
identified.
first
of
all,
i
mean,
courts
can
certainly
do
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
but
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--there
--
there
are
other
issues
that
were
raised.
i
think
for
our
purposes
that
the
strongest
one
that
was
most
clearly
substantial
is
the
speedy
trial
one.
and
that's
the
one
that
we
identified.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
your
question
actually
captures
why
these
mistakes
happen
by
court
of
appeals
judges.
the
court
of
appeals
judge
presumably
--
and
again,
i'm
just
presuming
here.
this
court's
seen
this
mistake
happen
before.
and
i
think
what
--
the
judge
that
looked
at
this,
didn't
make
a
determination
there
wasn't
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
had
to
know
that
that
was
there.
but
for
the
court
of
appeals'
purposes,
they
are
just
going
to
sort
out
the
procedural
question,
and
if
it's
timely
they
are
not
going
to
address
speedy
trial
in
the
first
instance.
that
would
go
back
to
the
district
court.
so
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
just
as
a
practical
matter
why
this
mistake
happens
sometimes,
in
this
certificate
of
appealability
process.
but
the
fundamental
question
here
is
one
of
statutory
construction:
did
congress
make
clear,
clear
at
level
we
require
for
jurisdiction,
clear
that
we
--
at
the
level
we
would
require
for
holding
--
and
i've
never
seen
this
anywhere
in
this
court's
precedents
--
holding
that
an
individual
pro
se
prisoner
who
does
everything
reasonably
possible,
fully
and
timely
complies
with
all
obligations,
will
still
have
his
right
to
first
habeas
on
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
irretrievably
jurisdictionally
foreclosed
because
the
court
of
appeals
judge
miswrote
a
certificate
documenting
a
judgment
that
the
officer
made?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
certainly
that
there
is
that
point.
i
think
what's
important
to
recognize
is
that
there
is
actually
a
similarity
between
this
court's
notice
of
appeal
cases
in
something
like
houston
v.
lack,
the
mail
--
prison
mailbox
rule.
you
have
a
specific
textual
jurisdictional
requirement
in
the
--
in
the
rules,
that
requires
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
with
the
clerk
of
the
district
court.
and
this
court
said
look,
when
it
comes
to
prisoners
who
have
done
everything
humanly
possible
within
their
control
to
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirements,
we
are
not
going
to
interpret
these
rules
--
as
part
of
the
presumption,
we
don't
interpret
rules
to
strip
away
jurisdiction
from
individuals
who
have
done
everything
humanly
possible,
particularly
when
the
facts
on
the
ground
are
that
the
statute
was
satisfied.
the
facts
here
are
that
it
was
met,
and
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
judge
garza
made
that
determination--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
speedy
trial--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
can
be
appealed.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
can
--
that
can
be
appealed.
there
are
--
you
can
--
you
can
--
there
are
processes
for
attempting
to
appeal
single-judge
orders.
within
every
court
of
appeals,
they
have
rules
for
that.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
you
have
a
pro
se
prisoner
who
thought
he
won.
he
got
something
that
was
hard
to
get
from
a
court
of
appeals
judge
and
that's
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
he
did
that
by
providing
documentation
of
a
substantial
speedy
trial
claim,
a
speedy
trial
claim
unlike
this
court
has
ever
seen,
a
10-year
gap
between
indictment
and
trial
and
then
conviction
on
nothing
but
eyewitness
testimony.
he
documented
that
for
the
court,
did
everything
he
could.
and
it
isn't
until
this
court
that
the
state
says:
hang
on;
there
was
never
any
jurisdiction
over
this
whole
case.
they
didn't
tell
the
court
of
appeals
judges
that.
they
didn't
say
anything
until
the
case
came
to
this
court.
and
that
type
of
trap--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
i
absolutely
agree
that
it's
mandatory
and
if
timely
raised
must
be
dealt
with.
i
think
it's
an
open
question
whether
if
it's
not
raised
until
you're
actually
before
the
panel,
whether
the
panel
then
has
to
identify
one
of
its
judges
to
issue
a
certificate
or
it
can
simply
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
say
we've
determined
that
this
should
go
forward,
even
though
the
initial
--
would
you
have
to
go
through
a
formal
amendment
process?
or
you
just
do
that
as
part
of
your
decision?
i
think
either
one
will
accomplish
the
same
result
and
will
comply
with
the
statute,
the
functional
gatekeeping
requirement.
but
the
separate
question
which
your
question
--
your
comment
leads
to
is
that
in
looking
at
this,
would
congress
have
wanted
this
gatekeeping
function
to
be
subject
to
perpetual
review
and
revision,
obligatory
perpetual
review
by
the
panel?
you
couldn't
accept
that
your
colleague
found
that
there
was
a
substantial
question;
all
three
judges
would
again
have
to
revisit
that
and
determine
that
it's
substantial.
this
was
set
up
as
a
gatekeeping
requirement
and
it
was
meant
to
be
a
--
a
promotion
of
efficiency,
not
to
cause
more
work,
not
to
cause
more
paperwork,
to
sift
out
cases,
identify
the
appeals
that
merit
the
time
and
resources
of
the
court.
and
once
that's
identified,
the
more
efficient
process
is
not
to
make
the
certificate
of
appealability
a
whole
side
show,
a
whole
other
layer
of
processing
ping-ponging
back
and
forth
between
this
court,
courts
of
appeals;
courts
of
appeals,
single
judges.
we
simply
--
we
try
--
we
look
at
this
and
we
determine
that
a
judgment
was
made
by
a
judicial
officer
sworn
to
uphold
the
law;
a
substantial
showing
was
made.
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
written
down
as
the
statute
likes
is
a
problem;
it
should
have
been
raised,
but
it
wasn't
raised,
and
we
don't
start
all
over.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well
i
think
this
--
my
point
is
that
a
substantial
showing
was
made,
so
this
court
doesn't
even
have
to
determine
the
status
of
(c)(2).
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
with--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
i
think
--
in
jimenez
is
--
we
are
--
we
are
happy
to
take
the
language
of
jimenez
which--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--this
court
said
in
jimenez
that
the
--
quote,
i'm
quoting
here,
"the
language
points
to
the
conclusion
of
direct
appellate
proceedings
in
state
court.
"
as
--
end
quote,
as
a
--
as
a
moment
of
finality.
and
that
is
the
test
that
we
are
asking
for.
the
conclusion
of
direct
appellate
proceedings
in
state
court
in
texas
is
the
issuance
of
the
mandate.
clay
and
jimenez
together
prove
our
point.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
two
responses
to
that.
first,
that
simply
begs
the
question
that
we're
presenting
in
this
case
of
when
the
direct
review
ended.
that's
our
argument
in
the
case,
is
that
prong.
when
did
that
direct
review
prong
end?
and
the
second
--
the
second
aspect
of
this
is
to
understand
what
happened
in
jimenez.
the
whole
argument
there
was
that
you've
got
to
--
by
the
state,
was
you're
only
--
you
stopped
--
remember,
jimenez
had
stopped
at
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
as
well.
and
the
state's
argument
was
you
stopped
at
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
originally,
so
you
are
only
in
the
expiration
of
review
prong.
and
this
--
but
then
he
went
back
4
years
later,
i
think
it
was,
and
got
the
court
to
reopen,
started
--
had
a
whole
new
direct
review
process
going
on.
and
this
court
said
--
rejected
the
argument
that
because
he
didn't
go
to
the
intermediate
court
we
don't
look
at
the
direct
review
prong,
we
only
look
at
expiration
or
review
prong.
we
don't
look
at
that.
we
stop
and
we
look
to
see
is
the
state
done.
and
whichever
those
two
prongs
you're
in,
and
it
may
depend
on
what
time
the
question
is
asked,
whichever
prong
you're
in,
the
last
--
the
last
of
those
will
determine
when
your
judgment
becomes
final.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
first
of
all,
the
language
forks
out
again,
and
so
it
says
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
becomes
final,
and
then
there
is
the
two
options
for
finality--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well
--
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
do
we
know
when
that
--
that
direct
review
process,
what
you're
calling
the
lose
prong,
ends?
and
it's
when
the
state
says:
done.
because
the
of
point
of
this
is
not
an
exhaustion
prong.
the
point
2244(d)(1)
in
particular,
but
2244(d)
generally,
is
to
say,
as
the
court
talked
about,
is
the
state
done?
this
supports
federalism.
ex
parte
johnson,
a
case
that
we
cite,
footnote
2,
says
until
the
mandate
issues
the
appeal
continues.
and
so
the
notion--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--one,
i
don't
think
the
text
compels
that
one
way
or
the
other.
it
says
when
does
it
become
final.
and
so
let's
ask
the
questions:
when
did
the
direct
review
conclude--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--and
the
issue
is
--
and
i
hate
to
call
it
the
"lose
prong"
--
but
when
did
he
lose?
when
did
the
state
say,
we
are
done
and
we've
decided
this
case
is
over,
this
appeal
is
over?
and
that
was
when
the
mandate
issued.
this
is
only
about
when
that
prong
happened.
and
because
you
can
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
you
would
have
the
exact
same
test.
the
answer
is
easier
in
the
federal
system,
because
when
direct
review
is
concluded
--
this
court
said
in
clay,
look,
if
all
we
had
to
look
at
was
conclusion
of
direct
review
--
it
didn't
say
we
didn't
know
it
--
there
would
be
no
conclusion,
because
of
the
mandate.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
a
result
--
but
that's
already
a
result
of
jimenez,
which
had
this
whole
reopening
process
that
i
--
unless
the
federal
system
were
to
do
that,
there
is
--
as
this
court
noted
in
wall
v.
kholi,
you
can
have
discretionary
applications
that
can
be
called
direct
review
as
well.
direct
review
is
not
the
linear
process
that
is
tried
to
be
portrayed
here.
and
the
time
ultimately
is
the
same.
what
happened
in
clay
--
these
things
are
equivalent.
you
have
the
same
test.
sometimes
the
outcome
is
different
based
on
what
the
individual
does
and
what
the
state
law
allows,
but
you
have
--
this
is
supposed
to
protect
federalism.
and
the
only
way
to
protect
federalism
and
comity
interests
is
to
respect
when
the
state
says
it's
done.
to
have
the
federal
law
tell
them
you're
done
and
to
start
the
statute
of
limitations
ruling
when
state
law
is
saying
we
are
not
done,
the
appeal
continues
and
do
not
start
your
state
post-conviction
relief,
is
to
put
federal
law
at
loggerheads
with
the
state
law
it's
supposed
to
be
respecting.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.

ms.

--i
apologize
for
the

your
honor.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kagan,
the
question
is
whether
state
prisoners
now
should
be
worse
off
than
federal
prisoners.
it
is
not
some
prisoners
that
will
fall
in
this
gap.
it
is
99
plus
percent
of
prisoners;
because
in
texas
--
in
texas
only
about
1
percent
file
discretionary
petitions
for
review.
far
less
than
that
--
99.7,
99.8
percent
do
not
seek
cert
on
direct
review
from
this
court.
so
we
are
now
in
some
backwards
world
where
we
--
clay
is
going
to
drive
the
rule
for
federal
prisoners,
is
going
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
the
question
is
what
one
means
by
the
so-called
natural
conclusion
of
direct
review.
now
statistically,
this
is
a
statutory
provision
written
for
state
prisoners
by
congress,
to
address
state
prisoners;
and
if
the
natural
thing
that
happens
in
the
world
is
99
percent
do
not
even
seek
review
in
the
state's
highest
court.
and
i'm
extrapolating
from
texas;
i
don't
know
all
50
states
but
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that's
anomalous.
99
percent
don't
file
petitions
for
discretionary
review.
what
kind
--
why
would
congress
have
written
this
statute
in
a
way
that's
going
to
create
a
gap,
that
is
going
to
cause
prisoners
who
wouldn't
otherwise
file
to
now
file?
instead
of
2000,
they
are
now
going
to
have
102,000
petitions
for
discretionary
review,
and
the
texas
courts--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--correct.
correct.
and
i'm
--
this
is
--
the
texas
judicial
reports
are
--
are
available
on
line
that
record
this.
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
the
number
of
petitions
each
year.
roughly
the
last
3
years,
in
the
2000-ish
range.
convictions
in
the
state.
more
than
100,000
range.
and
so--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
talking
about
the
former.
but
the
point--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
point
is,
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--they
--
they
may
or
may
not.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
kinsey
case,
the
texas
court
of
--
the
texas
courts
have
actually
entertained
a
speedy
trial
claim
in
--
at
both
levels.
it
was
raised
on
direct
review
and
then
it
wasn't
--
but
--
right.
it
was
also
--
they
have
raised
in
both
forums.
so
it
casts
some
doubt
on
the
procedural
default
argument
advanced
here,
but
you're
right.
of
course
there
--
there
are
issues
here,
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
wanted
a
gap.
in
johnson
v.
united
states,
this
court
construed
2255,
i
think
it
was
subsection
4
there,
the
one
on
--
if
a
conviction
is
overturned
it
was
used
to
enhance.
and
then
what
is
the
timing
to
come
back
and
file
a
habeas
claim
to
change
your
sentence
that
relied
on
a
now-vacated
prior
conviction.
and
this
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
construe
this
language
to
create
a
gap
between
when
the
--
when
the
finality
attaches
and
when
the
time
that
you
can
actually
file
for
post-conviction
review
commences.
the
whole
point
of
this,
of
2244,
was
to
respect
state
processes.
it's
not
another
exhaustion
requirement;
it's
respect
the
state.
and
texas
couldn't
be
clear;
in
ex
parte
johnson
footnote
2,
it
says
the
appeal
continues
--
sorry,
may
i
finish
the
sentence?
the
appeal
continues
until
the
mandate
issues.
federal
law
shouldn't
change
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
99
percent
of
--
the
way--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--some
of
them
did.
mr.
jimenez
was
a
plea
bargain.
some
of
them
do.
