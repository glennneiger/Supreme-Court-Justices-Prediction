ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no.
i
think
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
understood
exactly
what
the
issue
was.
in
footnote
one
of
its
opinion,
it
said
the
petitioner
has
briefed
these
four
other
--
these
four
constitutional
claims
in
addition
to
the
procedural
claim
that
was
in
the
certificate
of
appealability.
a
coa
was
not
granted
on
any
of
those
issues,
so
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
them.
nobody
has
made
a
determination
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
single
constitutional
issue
that
could
potentially
warrant
habeas
relief
for
petitioner.
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
the
courts
being
confused.
it's
a
matter
of
what
the
--
what
the
statute
is
trying
to
do
is
getting
everybody
to
focus
up
front
on
why
this
case
should
go
forward
in
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that
could
certainly
happen.
there
should
be
a
presumption
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
amended
the
certificate
of
appealability,
an
appeal
could
go
forward
on
that
issue.
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
--
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
just
because
the
district
court
kicked
this
case
out
on
a
procedural
issue
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
reach
the
substantive
issue
if
it
reversed
the
procedural
issue.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
it
certainly
could
send
it
back.
but
if
that
issue
was
briefed,
and
if
it
was
briefed
again
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
could
decide
it.
there's
no
bar
to
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--even
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
normally
do
that,
this
court
said
in
slack
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
--
or
if
the
district
court
kicks
the
case
out
on
a
procedural
ground,
the
certificate
of
appealability
has
to
indicate
at
least
that
the
procedural
issue
is
debatable
and
also
that
a
constitutional
issue
in
the
case
is
debatable.
nobody
has
ever
made
that
determination
in
this
case.
if
--
if
a
court
of
appeals
judge
would
have
noticed
it
and
--
and
reissued
a
new
certificate
that
certified
that
constitutional
question,
that
would
be
fine,
and
the
case
could
go
forward,
but
if
this--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--this
court
could
do
that.
section
2253(c)(1)
gives
circuit
justices
the
authority
to
issue
amended
certificates
of
appealability.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
the
court
has
procedures
in
place
where
like,
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
would
normally
go
to
the
circuit
justice,
and
then
i
suppose
could
be
referred
to
the
court.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
but
this
court's
procedures
indicate
that.
i
think
that
under
the
statute,
sure,
any
circuit
justice
could
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability.
that
might--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--a
circuit
justice
or
judge.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
ann
o'connell
under
this
court's
procedures
the
application
i
think
would
have
to
go
to
justice
scalia--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--and
then
come
back.
ms.
ann
o'connell
however,
even
if
this
court
were
to
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability,
if
the
--
if
the
court
determined
that
there
was
actually
a
debatable
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
which
no
federal
judge
has
done
to
this
point,
i
don't
think
that
it
could
still
reach
the
procedural
issue
that's
presented
in
the
second
question.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
decision
on
that,
on
that
question;
so
the
only
remedy
would
be
for
this
court
to
vacate
that
opinion
and
either
send
it
back
with
an
order
to
dismiss,
if
it
didn't
think
there
was
a
debatable
constitutional
issue,
or
let
the
court
of
appeals
reissue
its
opinion
or
redecide
the
case
how
it
wants
to.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
issue
a
certificate
of
appealability
in
this
case.
because
it
has
to
go
back
anyway,
it
makes
more
sense
to
let
the
court
of
appeals
tell
us
if
--
if
what
they
thought
is
that
there
was
a
debatable
constitutional
issue
here
on
the
speedy
trial
claim.
it's
not
clear
at
all
that
they
did
think
that.
footnote
a
of
their
opinion
says
they
--
the
petitioner
briefed
the
speedy
trial
claim
but
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
it.
ms.
ann
o'connell
it
indicates
that
--
that
they
didn't
think
that
the
speedy
trial
claim
was
implicitly
included
in
the
certificate
of
appealability.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
--
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
kagan.
it's
no
different
than
under
section
1331,
a
court
would
have
to
take
a
peek
at
the
merits
to
see
if
there
is
a
--
a
federal
question
in
the
case
before
letting
it
move
forward.
it's
just
looking
at
what
the
class
of
cases
is
that
section
2253--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it
is,
and
--
and
once
a
--
a
judge
issues
a
certificate
of
appealability
on
that
question
it
should
be
presumed
that
it's
been
satisfied.
what
we
are
saying
in
--
when
we
say
that
(c)(2)
is
jurisdictional
is
that
if
it
becomes--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes.
but
if
a
--
if
a
district
judge
or
a
court
of
appeals
judge
has
made
a
determination
that
there's
a
constitutional
issue
that's
debatable,
going
forward
that
seems
to
be
something
that
would
be
extremely
hard
to
overturn.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
mean.
i
think
that
could
happen.
in
most
cases
it's
not
going
to
be
an
issue.
if
somebody
certified
that
it's
debatable,
then
somebody
has
made
that
showing.
if
it
turns
out
--
like
for
example,
if
there
was,
if
the
petitioner
had
said
my
right
to
testify
at
trial
was
violated;
they
wouldn't
let
me
testify;
and
then
that
issue
is
certified
and
then
it
turns
out
when
it
gets
to
the
merits
panel
that
he
did
in
fact
testify
and
it
was
a
totally
frivolous
claim
--
yes,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
dismiss
the
case
at
that
point
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
kagan,
i
think
it's
because
we
don't
actually
know
that
a
substantial
showing
has
been
made
until
a
federal
judge
tells
us
that.
we
could
--
you
know
you
could
assume
that
a
substantial
showing
was
made.
it's
not
clear
that
--
that
judge
garza
that
or
that
any
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that.
