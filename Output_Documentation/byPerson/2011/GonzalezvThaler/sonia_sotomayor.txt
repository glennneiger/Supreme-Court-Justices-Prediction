justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
before
your
time
expires,
i'd
like
to
ask
one
question
on
the
merits.
in
jimenez,
we
held
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
2244(d)(1)(a)
is
to
read
it
like
we
read
2255.
and
we
read
2255
to
say
that
finality
is
reached
when
direct
review,
and
direct
review
concludes
when
the
court
affirms
a
conviction
or
denies
a
petition,
or,
if
the
defendant
foregoes
direct
review,
when
the
time
for
seeking
such
review
expires.
isn't
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
did--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
22
--
with
2244?
it
read
it
exactly
the
way
we
read
it
in
jimenez?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know,
but
you're
not
taking
its
holding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
--
you
take
language
from
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i
read
--
i
read
jimenez
to
say
that
the
court
should
be
reading
this
alternative
"or"
language
in
exactly
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
jimenez
held
that
it's
an
either/or.
if
you
do
direct
review,
you
do
it
from
the
time
that
it's
final,
that
it
concludes;
or
if
you've
foregone
direct
review,
when
the
time
for
seeking
review
expires.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you
accepting
justice
scalia's
point
that
the
certificate
of
appealability
doesn't
have
to
jurisdictionally
describe
the
substantial
constitutional
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
agreed
with
the
question
he
posed
to
your
adversary,
that
you
are
saying
that
this
was
deficient
because
both,
it
didn't
indicate
the
issue,
and
because
it
didn't
describe
the
substantial
constitutional
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
put
that
to
one
side.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
a
little
confused,
okay?
and
i
think
it's
what
justice
ginsburg
was
trying
to
get
at,
and
justice
breyer,
which
is:
what
you
are
requiring
in
you're
saying
the
statute
requires,
if
for
the
district
court
to
always
reach
the
merits
of
any
argument
presented
in
a
habeas
petition,
to
figure
out
whether
it's
a
substantial
argument
before
it
dismisses
on
a
procedural
ground.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
seems
to
be
what
you're,
you're
wanting
to
happen
because
a
judge
would
have
to
say:
i'm
dismissing
on
a
procedural
ground
and
i
believe
that
the
claim
is
more
than
non-frivolous,
that
it
has
a
substantial
basis.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
that
speed
the
habeas
process
in
the
normal
cases?
i
mean,
in
my
experience,
what
district
court
judges
do
is
find
the
easiest
way
to
dismiss
something.
if
the
speedy
trial
ground
is
the
easiest,
they
go
that
way.
i'm
sorry.
if
it's
not
and
it's
a
procedural
bar,
they
use
a
procedural
bar.
they
don't
create
extra
work
for
themselves.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
we
do
then--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
happens
if
it
happens?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
--
does
that
make
any
sense?
isn't
it
easier
to
read
it
--
the
statute
the
way
your
adversary
suggests,
which
would
protect
both
the
right
to
direct
review
and
the
right
to
collateral
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
of
how
much
the
jurisdictional
question
plagues
the
courts
below?
meaning,
is
it
--
is
it
so
complicated
that
people
below
don't
really
know
what
district
courts
are
granting
coas
on?
do
--
circuit
courts
don't
understand
what
the
issues
are
somehow
by
the
opinion
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
circuit
judge
--
or
circuit
judge
or
judge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
petitioner
gonzalez
was
convicted
in
texas
state
court.
after
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court
affirmed
his
conviction,
gonzalez
allowed
his
time
for
seeking
review
with
the
state's
highest
court
for
criminal
appeals
to
expire.
the
intermediate
state
appellate
court,
however,
did
not
issue
its
mandate
until
roughly
six
weeks
later.
when
gonzalez
later
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition,
the
district
court
dismissed
gonzalez's
petition
as
time
barred
by
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
aedpa,
it's
easier
to
say
that,
of
1996.
the
district
court
so
held
based
on
its
determination
that
gonzalez's
judgment
had
become
final
when
his
time
for
seeking
review
in
the
state's
highest
court
expired
not
when
the
intermediate
state
court
issued
its
mandate.
gonzalez
then
sought
a
certificate
of
appealability,
known
as
coa,
to
appeal
the
district
court's
order.
a
sixth
circuit
judge
granted
gonzalez
a
coa
on
the
timeliness
issue.
the
coa,
however,
failed
to
indicate
a
constitutional
issue.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
it
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
gonzalez's
petition
was
time
barred.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
mention
and
the
state
did
not
raise
any
defect
in
the
coa.
when
gonzalez
petitioned
this
court
for
review,
the
state
argued
for
the
first
time
that
the
fifth
circuit
lacked
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
appeal
based
on
a
defect
in
the
coa.
this
case
requires
us
to
interpret
two
provisions
of
aedpa.
the
first
provision,
28
u.s.c.
2253(c)(3)
requires
that
the
coa
“shall
indicate
which
specific
issue”
on
which
the
petitioner
has
made
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
for
the
reasons
we
explain
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
2253(c)(3)
is
a
mandatory,
but
nonjurisdictional
requirement.
accordingly,
a
judge's
failure
to
indicate
the
requisite
constitutional
issue
in
a
coa
does
not
deprive
a
court
of
appeals
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
habeas
petitioner's
appeal.
the
second
provision,
28
u.s.c.
2244(d)(1)(a)
establishes
a
one
year
limitations
period
for
state
prisoners
to
file
federal
habeas
petitions
running
from
"the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review."
as
explained
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
for
a
state
prisoner
who
does
not
seek
review
in
the
state's
highest
court,
the
judgment
becomes
final
on
the
date
that
the
time
for
seeking
such
review
expires.
accordingly,
gonzalez's
judgment
became
final
on
the
date
that
his
time
for
seeking
review
in
the
state's
highest
court
for
criminal
appeals
expired.
gonzalez's
federal
habeas
petition
was
therefore
untimely.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
dissenting
opinion.
