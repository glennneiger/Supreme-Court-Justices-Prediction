how
do
--
how
do
you
decide
whether
it's
a
jurisdictional
bar?
you
acknowledge
that
the
issuance
by
a
judge
of
a
certificate
of
appealability
is
a
jurisdictional
step;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
jurisdictional.
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
there's
no
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
--
so
the
issue
is
whether
(c)(3),
which
says
"the
certificate
of
appealability
shall
indicate
which
specific
issue
or
issues
satisfy
the
showing
required.
"
whether
that
provision
is
a
requirement
for
the
validity
of
the
certificate
of
appealability.
if
it
is,
then
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
because
the
certificate
of
appealability
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
take
the
fourth
amendment,
i
mean,
which
says
"no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause.
"
okay?
so
--
but
then
it
goes
on,
"supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
"
is
a
warrant
valid
if
indeed
it
does
not
meet
those
requirements
of
being
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
won't
be
valid.
it
will
just
be
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
millett,
it
seems
to
me
you
beg
the
question
when
you
say
that
the
issue
is
whether
the
appeal
will
go
forward.
that's
precisely
what
--
what
the
issue
is
here,
whether
--
it
is
that
the
appeal
will
go
forward
or
whether
an
appeal
on
an
identified
issue
will
go
forward.
that's
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
wants
an
appeal
to
go
forward
on
a
particular
issue,
and
--
and
not
in
--
not
in
general
on
--
on
who
knows
how
many
issues.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
it
doesn't
come
forward,
doesn't
come
forward
unless
there
is
a
certificate
of
appealability.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
it
says
the
certificate
of
appealability
shall
indicate
which
specific
issues
are
issues
satisfying
the
showing
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--done
everything
humanly
possible
and
just
because
of
the
mistake
of
a
--
of
a
district
judge,
it
can't
go
forward.
but
that
happens.
what
if
a
district
judge
does
--
makes
a
mistake
and
--
and
he
thinks
that
there
has
not
been
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right?
he
makes
a
mistake
about
that.
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
--
the
same
terrible
result
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ms.
millett,
as
i
understand
the
state,
the
state
is
not
contending
that
(c)(2)
is
jurisdictional,
so
you're
--
you're
arguing
against
a
position
they
haven't
taken.
they
--
they
don't
say
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
if
in
fact
there
has
been
no
substantial
showing,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
review
that.
they
are
just
saying
that
(c)(3)
which
describes
the
content
of
the
--
of
the
certificate
of
appealability,
is
in
effect
jurisdictional.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
think
you're
--
you're
exaggerating
the
consequence
of
what
the
state
is
urging
us
to
hold
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
the
state
wouldn't
go
into
that.
they're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
--
where
is
2244(d)(1)?
i
looked
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
petition
for
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
in
your
brief?
i
mean,
it's
what
your
brief's
about.
why
isn't
it
in
the
appendix
of
your
brief.
it's
also
not
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
it's
also
not
in
the
appendix
of
the
state's
brief.
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
petition
to
get
it.
i
mean
it's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
i
don't
understand
why
the
text
is
not
in
your
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mitchell,
do
you
think
the
federal
court
of
appeals
could
do
it
nunc
pro
tunc
without
first
making
the
determination
that
the
trial
judge
was
supposed
to
have
made
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
would
have
to
make
the
determination
required
by
(c)(1),
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
wouldn't
necessarily
point
him
just
to
the
speedy
trial
act.
he
would
have
to
see
what
other
constitutional
claims
are
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
!
