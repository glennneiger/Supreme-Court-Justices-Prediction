mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
lacked
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
mr.
gonzalez's
habeas
petition,
because
the
document
issued
by
the
circuit
judge
in
this
case
fails
to
qualify
as
to
required
certificate
of
appealability
under
2253(c)(1).
justice
kagan
asked
my
opponent
how
one
should
determine
whether
a
document
counts
as
a
certificate
of
appealability.
the
answer
is
found
in
section
2253(c)(3).
a
certificate
of
appealability
under
paragraph
one
shall
indicate
which
specific
issue
or
issues
satisfies
the
substantial
showing
requirement
in
paragraph
(c)(2).
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we
agree
that
the
judge
is
at
fault.
the
petitioner
did
mention
in
his
application
for
a
coa
his
speedy
trial
claim,
so
i
don't
believe
we
can
fault
mr.
gonzalez
for
the
way
he
applied
for
a
coa.
but
at
the
same
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
gonzalez
if
he
had
the
opportunity
to
qualify
for
a
coa
under
2253
should
have
the
opportunity
to
seek
a
new
coa,
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
(c)(3)--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--if
the
court
of
appeals
judge
does
it?
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
if
he
does
that
before
the
court
of
appeals
issues
its
judgment,
we
believe
that's
permissible
under
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
the
problem
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
do
that.
they
entered
judgment
without
a
valid
certificate--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--okay,
because
mr.
gonzalez--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--mr.
gonzalez
can't
qualify
for
a
coa
under
the
standards
this
court
has
set
forth
in
slack
and
miller-el.
because
the
speedy
trial
claim
encounters
an
insurmountable
procedural
obstacle.
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
case
that
2253
and
slack
and
miller-el
are
designed
to
keep
out
of
the
federal
appellate
court.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
a
circuit
judge
can
issue
a
coa
under
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
you
would
have
to
make
the
determination,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
but,
the
question--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--that's
correct
and
often
the
courts
of
appeal
will
have
their
own
circuit
rules
that
govern
how
litigants
should
seek
certificate
of
appealability.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
but
at
the
same
time
any
other
appeals
that
should
not
have
been
taken
will
be
cut
off
at
the
district
court
as
they
should
be.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
no,
it
must
describe
the
constitutional
issue--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--our
contention
is
that
a
certificate
of
appealability
must
indicate
a
specific
constitutional
claim
under
c(3)
to
qualify
as
a
certificate
of
appealability
under
c(1).
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
c(2)
is
phrased
differently
from
c(3).
c(3)
describes
the
essential
content
of
what
a
certificate
of
appealability
must
contain.
c(2)
by
contrast
simply
says
that
a
certificate
of
appealability
may
issue
under
paragraph
1
only
if
the
applicant
has
made
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
it's
defining
the
conditions
under
which
a
coa
may
issue.
a
wrongly
issued
coa
is
not
necessarily
one
that
is
patently
defective
so
that
it
no
longer
deserves
the
title
of
certificate
of
appealability.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
perhaps
analogy
from
other
areas
of
appellate
jurisdiction
--
sometimes
a
district
court
may
issue
a
final
judgment
for
the
wrong
party.
perhaps
he
entered
summary
judgment
and
he
shouldn't.
that
final
judgment
may
be
erroneous,
it
may
be
wrongly
issued,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it
deprives
the
appellate
court
of
jurisdiction
to
review
what
the
district
court
did.
and
we--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--right.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
2253(a)
reads
as
though
it's
a
grant
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
it
says
that
in
either
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
or
in
a
2255,
the
final
order
shall
be
subject
to
review
on
appeal
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
doesn't
mention
the
word
jurisdiction
but
it's
phrased
in
the
way
that
is,
seems
as
though
it's
conferring
appellate
jurisdiction
in
cases
where
a
habeas
petition
or
a
2255
motion
precedes
the
finality
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
right,
2253(a)
is
the
provision
that
establishes
appellate
jurisdiction
in
habeas
cases.
and
then
subsections
(b)
and
(c)
narrow
that
jurisdictional
ground
and
define
the
conditions
under
which
a
litigant
cannot
take
an
appeal
and
in
which
cases
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
exercise
appellate
jurisdiction.
this
court
also
has
held
in
miller-el
that
the
issuance
of
certificate
of
appealability
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
an
appeal.
and
in
holding
that,
it
relied
on
a
long
history
of
treating
both
the
coa
and
the
earlier
certificate
of
probable
cause.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
we
view
the
purpose
of
2253(c)
as
keeping
cases
out
of
the
courts
of
appeals
when
habeas
petitioners
have
no
chance
of
obtaining
ultimate
habeas
relief.
it's
designed
to
keep
out
petitions
that
may
present
interesting
statute
of
limitations
issues
but--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--he
can't
grant
the
coa
under
slack.
if
the
constitutional
claim
has
no
merit
then--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--well
the
first
problem
is
the
speedy
trial
in
this
case
encounters
a
procedural
bar.
if
we
put
that
to
one
side--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--and
assume
that
this
were
a
case
where
he
had
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
the
circuit
judge
simply
forgot
to
write
it
down,
the
statute
requires
that
the
constitutional
claim
has
to
be
indicated
in
writing
in
the
certificate.
that
first--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--he
doesn't
have
to--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--he
doesn't
have
to--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--right.
he
doesn't
have
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
speedy
trial
claim.
he
just
needs
to
take
a
peek
at
the
constitutional
claim
and
see
if
it
has
some
chance
of
being
substantial.
and
if
it
encounters
a
procedural
bar,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
because
mr.
gonzalez
never
sought
direct
review
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--thanks.
on
a
statute
of
limitations
question,
this
case
turns
on
the
meaning
of
section
2244(d)(1)(a)
which
first
establishes
the
date
on
which
the
conviction,
the
judgment
became
final
as
a
potential
starting
point
for
the
one-year
limitations
period
and
then
establishes
two
prongs
for
determining
when
that
date
of
finality
occurs.
finality
under
the
statute
can
occur
either
at
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
it
can
occur
at
the
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
such
review.
and
fifth
circuit
correctly
held
that
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
prong
applies
only
when
the
habeas
applicant
pursues
direct
review
to
its
natural
conclusion,
by
obtaining
either
a
judgment
or
a
denial
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
expiration
of
time
prong
should
govern
all
other
cases,
those
in
which
the
habeas
applicant
allows
the
time
for
seeking
direct
review
to
expire
before
reaching
this
court.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
in
some
cases,
that
will
happen.
there
will
be
habeas
petitioners
who
have
concluded
their
direct
review
process,
or
they've,
in
this
case,
they
have
allowed
the
time
to
expire.
but
the
statute
of
limitations
will
start
running
for
federal
habeas,
yet
they
won't
be
able
to
quite
yet
go
to
state
court.
but--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
right.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
that's
correct.
and
it's
only
a
45-day
window
or
so
in
this
particular
case.
and
in
most
cases,
it
should
only
be
a
few
weeks
or
months.
no
one
is
going
to
lose
their
entire
one-year
clock
waiting
for
their
ability
to
seek
state
post-conviction
review
to
begin.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
if
that
were
to
happen,
then
the
prisoner
should
file
a
protective
habeas
petition
under
rhines
v.
weber.
he
should
file
it
in
federal
district
court
and
then
ask
the
district
judge
to
use
the
stay-and-abeyance
procedure
that
this
court
used
in
rhines,
and
then
wait
for
his
opportunity
to
seek
state
post-conviction
review
and
return
to
federal
court.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
this
regime
now
for
almost
8
years,
since
roberts
was
decided.
and
as
far
as
we
know,
no
habeas
petitioner
has
had
to
file
a
protected
habeas
petition.
and
even
if
it
occasionally
will
happen,
it's
not
much
different
than
what
we
currently
deal
with
on
mixed
petitions,
when
a
habeas
petitioner
needs
to
use
the
stay-and-abeyance
mechanism
in
rhines.
one
other
point
back
on
jurisdiction.
it's
important
that
we
emphasize
we
asked
for
this
court
to
vacate
and
remand
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
but
the
only
reason
we
requested
a
dismissal
of
the
appeal
is
because
mr.
gonzalez
should
not
get
a
certificate
of
appealability
under
the
standards
of
slack
and
miller-el.
if
there
are
other
habeas
applicants
who
are
victims
of
(c)(3)
errors
committed
by
circuit
judges,
and
that
error
is
discovered
later
in
the
appellate
process,
the
proper
remedy
should
be
normally
to
allow
that
habeas
applicant
to
seek
a
new
certificate
of
appealability--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--because
it
would
also
--
your
honor's
proposal
would
allow
habeas
applicants
such
as
mr.
gonzalez
to
take
appeals
when
the
statute
precludes
them
from
taking
them.
and--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--it
doesn't
necessarily--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--several
harms.
one
of
the
functions
of
2253(c)
is
to
protect
the
habeas
applicants
who
have
substantial
constitutional
claims,
and
avoid
their
habeas
petitions
from
being
crowded
out
in
a
sea
of
meritless
petitions,
all
of
which
can
go
up
on
appeal--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--well,
it
would
have
to
be
both
merited
and
also
not
encounter
an
insurmountable
procedural
obstacle,
which
is
the
problem
that
plagues
mr.
gonzalez.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
if
states
are
allowed
to
waive
(c)(3),
it
will
open
opportunities
for
gamesmanship.
for
example,
a
state
lawyers
could
decide
whether
to
invoke
(c)(3)
based
on
the
strength
of
opposing
counsel.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we
ask
the
court
to
vacate
and
remand,
or
in
the
alternative,
affirm.
thank
you.
