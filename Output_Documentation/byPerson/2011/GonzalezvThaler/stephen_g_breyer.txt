justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
arguing
about?
it's
a
--
should
have
filled
in
the
blank
and
said
is
a
speedy
trial
action
here
and
he
didn't.
the
judge
didn't.
he
should
have
done
it,
he
didn't.
so
now
i'm
the
court
of
appeals
judge,
i
get
this
and
i
say
oh,
my
god,
he
forgot
to
fill
in
the
right
number.
i'll
tell
you
what,
i'll
fill
it
in
and
i'll
sign
my
name.
is
that
legal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
judge,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
the
case,
and
i
say
oh,
my
god.
i've
read
the
appendix.
i
don't
always
read
appendices,
but
sometimes
i
do.
and
i
know
this
is
blank
here
and
it's
suppose
to
say
speedy
trial.
and
so
i
get
out
my
pen
and
i
say
speedy
trial
act,
sb,
sign
it,
okay.
now,
is
everything
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
are
we
arguing
about?
why
not
just
say
look,
this
is
like
the
copy
write
act
registration
requirement.
i
mean,
it's
not
jurisdictional,
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
to
look
through
all
these
appendices
itself
to
see
that
everything
is
perfect.
it's
just
something
you
should
do.
and
if
you
didn't
do
it,
then
in
an
appropriate
case
the
judge
didn't
do
it
himself
or
waive
it
or
whatever
makes
sense
in
this
circumstances.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
entered
judgment
without
it.
we
will
assume,
nunc
pro
tunc,
they
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
horrible
thing
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
tell
me.
this
is
a
statute
that
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
speed
things
up,
which
was
to
help
courts
of
appeals
by
eliminating
drawls
while
focusing
on
issues
that
really
do
have
constitutional
issues.
now
suddenly
what's
worrying
me,
and
i
don't
have
the
definite
answer,
is
if
i
adopt
your
interpretation,
this
is
jurisdictional,
i
am
somehow
increasing
the
workload
of
the
courts
of
appeals
because
they
will
have
to
have
staff
people
going
through
to
see
whether
every
i
is
dotted
and
every
t
crossed
and
they
did
have
all
the
right
things
there,
and
the
pain
of
doing
that
is
if
you
don't
do
it,
then
you
have
to
do
these
things
over
again,
and
it
will
be
too
late,
people
get
another
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
then
--
i
mean,
you
can
read
the
statute
differently.
you
can
say
i'm
now
the
court
of
appeals
judge.
i
look
at
it.
lo
and
behold,
there
are
two
blanks.
but
on
the
basis
of
what
i
read
in
the
briefs
and
the
record,
i
can
say
that
the
appellant
has
made
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
know
the
record,
and
he
has
these
things
there.
and
also,
i
know
what
they
are.
okay?
so
i
fill
in
the
blanks,
or
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
fills
in
the
blanks,
with
the
panel's
approval.
now,
the
only
reason
for
doing
that
is
that
it
saves
everybody
a
lot
of
time,
and
it
costs
nobody
anything.
so
--
so
why
not,
since
the
language
permits
it,
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
no,
you're
giving
the
conclusion.
i've
just
said
the
statute
doesn't.
they
can
take
the
appeal
and
they
are
not
going
to
get
anywhere
because
of
this
error
of
the
lower
court
judge
unless
the
court
of
appeals,
having
looked
at
the
record
a
little
bit,
discovers
that
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question
and
they
know
what
it
is,
and
then
they
fill
in
the
blanks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
language
--
it
allows
that,
i
believe
--
and
the
purpose
would
allow
it,
for
after
all,
the
purpose
is
to
be
more
efficient,
not
less
efficient.
and
i
can't
think
of
any
harm
that's
done
reading
it
that
way.
so
you
tell
me
what
is
the
harm
that's
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
really
can't.
i'd
have
to
be
able
to
fill
in
those
blanks,
or
goodbye.
so
it
doesn't
get
any
meritless
ones
up
there.
the
only
ones
that
come
up
are
merit
--
merited.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
there
is
an
insurmountable
obstacle
--
although,
as
in
this
case
perhaps
we
don't
reach
the
constitutional
issue
--
there
is
one
there,
so
it
is
appealable,
but
we
say
we
do
not
reach
it
because
there
is
this
impossible
procedural
obstacle
that
here
blocks
it.
there
we
have
a
system
that
seems
more
efficient,
and
seems
what
is
being
argued,
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
say
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement
in
(2)
or
(3),
and
there
we
have
it.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
i
could
just
sign
this
tomorrow
and
that
would
moot
this
case
and
get
rid
of
it.
[laughter]
