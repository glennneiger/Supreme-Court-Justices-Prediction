justice
elena
kagan
just
to
take
a
kind
of
nutty
example,
ms.
millett,
suppose
that
a
judge
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
typed
the
words
"certificate
of
appealability"
on
top
and
issued
it.
still
jurisdiction
to
take
the
appeal?
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
counts
as
a
certificate
of
appealability
is
i
guess
the
question.
all
you
need
is
those
three
words
and
then
you
have
a
certificate
of
appealability?
justice
elena
kagan
--to
which
jurisdiction
attaches?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
millett,
let's
take
a
look
at
the
text
of
2244(d)(1).
it
says
limitation
shall
run
from
the
latest
of.
and
then
it
gives
four
dates
essentially,
four
sections,
each
of
which
produces
a
date,
a,
b,
c
and
d.
and
a
is
the
one
that's
concerned
here.
and
a
says
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
becomes
final
and
then
it
gives
two
ways
by
which
a
judgment
can
become
final.
and
the
two
ways
are
basically
you
lose
or
you
quit,
right.
you
lose
or
you
abandon
your
process.
so,
i
just
don't
understand
your
argument,
quite
honestly,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
a
says
the
date,
a
single
date,
on
which
the
judgment
becomes
final.
when
is
that
going
to
happen?
well,
for
some
people
it's
going
to
happen
when
they
lose
and
for
other
people
it's
going
to
happen
when
they
quit.
justice
elena
kagan
right.
two
ways
for
it
to
become
final:
they
lose
or
they
quit.
justice
elena
kagan
there's
no
suggestion
in
section
(a)
that
there
is
ever
going
to
be
a
conflict
between
these
two
ways
of
a
judgment
becoming
final.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
one
is
going
to
have
to
pick
between
them.
subsection
(a)
is
most
naturally
read
--
again
it
says
"the
date"
--
as
there
is
just
going
to
be
one
date.
and
some
people,
the
date
of
finality
is
going,
you
know,
it
becomes
final
because
they
lose.
other
people,
it
becomes
final
because
they
quit.
but
subsection
(a)
suggests
a
single
date,
not
two
dates
which
you
then
have
to
choose
between.
justice
elena
kagan
general
mitchell,
but
you
that
c(2)
is
not
jurisdictional,
is
that
correct?
you
say
that
c(1)
and
c(3)
are
but
c(2)
is
not?
justice
elena
kagan
if
that's
right,
why?
justice
elena
kagan
but
c(3)
says:
shall
indicate
which
specific
issues
satisfy
the
showing
required
by
c(2).
it
just
seems
as
if
all
of
these
are
a
little
bit
of
a
piece
and,
you
know,
you
can
stop
it
at
1
or
you
can
go
on
to
2
and
3.
but
it
seems
to
me
sort
of
hard
to
make
the
jump
here
and
leave
2
out
of
it.
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
presume,
general
mitchell,
that
he
thinks
that
it
does
but
he
just
forgot
to
write
down
speedy
trial.
and
the
question
is:
why
that
forgetting
to
write
down
speedy
trial
should
make
a
difference
here
given
that
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
in
any
event
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
reach
it
because
of
the
procedural
issue
that
it
had
to
reach
first.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
it
seems
to
me
that
ms.
millett's
best
argument
is
an
argument
just
about
the
oddity
of
what
would
happen
if
we
adopt
your
construction
of
the
statute,
which
is
that
the
time
begins
to
run
before
a
habeas
petitioner
actually
can
file
a
state
habeas
petition,
and
whether
that's
so
odd
as
to
make
this
a
--
a
wrong
way
to
construe
the
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.--
justice
elena
kagan
--ms.
o'connell,
could
i
just
clarify
your
argument?
you
disagree
with
the
state
of
texas,
isn't
that
right?
because
you
think
(c)(1),
(c)(2)
and
(c)(3)
are
all
jurisdictional;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
i
mean,
(c)(2)
is
--
it
appears
to
be
a
substantive
inquiry
jurisdictional,
that
in
any
case
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
make
this
--
is
going
to
have
to
ask
itself
whether
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
has
been
made,
and
that
would
seem
to
be
a
very
odd
thing
to
do
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
most
cases
the
federal
question
inquiry
is
just
look,
i'm
looking
at
your
complaint;
do
you
cite
a
federal
statute?
do
you
cite
a
federal
constitutional
provision?
if
so,
there's
a
federal
question
in
the
case.
what
(c)(2)
says
is
have
you
made
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right?
that's
a
very
different
inquiry.
justice
elena
kagan
well
is
it
a
jurisdictional
rule
that
we're
--
rule
that
we're
going
to
presume
that
it's
been
satisfied?
that's
a
sort
of
odd
thing
to
do
for
jurisdictional
rules.
right?
jurisdictional
rules,
we
sua
sponte
have
to
look
at
them
and
we
have
to
be
serious
about
them.
justice
elena
kagan
then
let's
go
on
to
(c)(3),
because
(c)(3)
seems
to
be
just
a
documentation
requirement.
in
other
words,
let's
presume
that
(c)(2)
has
been
satisfied;
there
was
a
substantial
showing
made;
and
there
is
a
documentation
error
and
(c)
--
under
(c)(3).
why
should
that
be
jurisdictional?
as
sort
of
--
you
know,
there
has
been
a
substantial
showing
made.
there
is
a
documentation
error.
it's
an
error
that
the
habeas
petitioner
has
absolutely
no
control
over.
why
should
we
view
that
as
a
jurisdictional
bar?
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
understand
that,
miss
millett.
i
mean
the
situation
in
this
case
is
presented
because
the
petitioner
here
didn't
seek
review
in
the
highest
state
court.
the
situation
is
not
presented
because
the
petitioner
did
not
file
a
cert
petition.
justice
elena
kagan
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
you.
you're
saying
99
percent
don't
file
petitions
in
texas's
highest
court?
justice
elena
kagan
the
argument
is
that
under
habeas
review
these
petitioners
are
not
going
to
be
in
good
shape,
right?
they
are
going
to
have
their
claims
unexhausted
or
defaulted?
