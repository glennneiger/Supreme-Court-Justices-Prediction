justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
suppose,
instead
of
having
a
statute
broken
down
into
(c)(1),
(2)
and
(3),
congress
had
written
(c)
as
just
one
paragraph
that
says:
you
must
have
a
certificate
of
appealability,
and
this
is
what
the
certificate
must
contain.
no
division
into
(2)
and
(3).
would
you
still
maintain
that
only
the
first
sentence
of
the
paragraph
is
jurisdictional
and
the
rest
is
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that
would
exclude
this
case,
wouldn't
it,
because
there
is
a
constitutional
issue.
it's
the
speedy
trial
issue.
but
that
issue
was
not
reached
below,
because
the
case
was
dismissed
as
untimely.
so
the
only
constitutional
issue
that's
in
the
case
is
one
that
couldn't
be
adjudicated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
isn't
that
right?
is
there
another
constitutional
issue
other
than
the
speedy
trial
issue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
little
odd
that
you
would
identify
that
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
take
it
up
because
it
wasn't
reached
below,
because
the
case
was
--
was
dismissed
at
an
earlier
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does,
it
does
suggest,
ms.
millett,
that
final,
two
ways
--
conclusion
of
direct
review
is
you've
gone
up
the
ladder
and
that's
it.
and
the
second
part
is,
well,
if
you
don't
go
up
the
ladder
you
would
stop.
then
when
your
time
to
go
up
the
ladder
has
ended,
that's
it.
it
--
it
seems
that
there
are
those
two
possibilities,
as
justice
kagan
put
it
so
well:
you
lose
or
you
quit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
have
a
difference
between
2255
and
2254.
and
on
the
state
level
you
would
have
a
variety
of
times,
because
some
states,
they
don't
all
make
it
the
mandate.
they
don't
set
finality
as
mandated.
there
may
be
different
--
there
may
be
different
periods
of
time
before
the
mandate
issues.
so
you
would
have
various
time
periods
for
state
prisoners.
but
if
you
were
a
federal
prisoner,
then
you
would
have
--
this
would
be
the
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
talking
about
test.
i'm
talking
about
time
periods.
there's
a
uniform
time
period
on
a
2255
petition.
it
would
not
be
a
uniform
time
period
for
2254
petitions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
back
up
and
tell
me
why
the
statute
we
are
dealing
with
2253,
why
does
jurisdictional,
if
jurisdiction
means,
as
we
have
said,
that
class
of
cases
that
the
court
is
competent
to
hear.
so
i
look
at
2254.
that's
state
habeus.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
federal
petition
by
a
state
prisoner.
and
2255
is
a
petition
by
federal
prisoner.
so
those
are
the
classifications.
the
classifications
are
habeas
cases,
54
state
prisoners,
55,
federal
prisoners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
2253,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
processing
rule
that
applies
to
both
categories.
it
applies
to
54
and
it
applies
to
55,
but
the
classes
of
cases
identified
in
54
and
55.
so
i
would
write
2253
as
a
mandatory
processing
but
not,
not
a
rule
that
tells
us
what
class
of
cases
the
court
is
competent
to
hear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
it
doubles
the
--
2254
is
jurisdictional;
2255
and
then
2253,
which
tells
how
you
are
to
proceed
under
either
one
of
those,
is
not
simply
a
mandatory
how
you
do
it
but
jurisdictional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
feature
of
this
case
that
i
think
is
very
unsettling
is
there
is
an
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide.
it's
the
timeliness
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
decide
the
speedy
trial.
if
the
--
if
this
case
were
to
fail
because
the
trial
judge
didn't
identify
the
speedy-trial
issue,
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
no
way
could
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
that
something
only
a,
a
distinction
only
a
lawyer
could
love?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
say
--
if
you
say
that,
here's
judge
gaza,
and
he
says:
yes,
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
question
here.
it
has
to
be
decided
before
we
get
to
the
speedy
trial.
but
if
the
judge
felt
that
the
speedy
trial
issue
was
not
meritorious,
then
why
would
he
grant
a
certificate
of
appealability
on
the
threshold
question
that
you'd
have
to
decide
before?
because
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
waste
of
everyone's
time
if
the
judge
thought
that
the
speedy
trial
issue
had
no
merit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
--
in
this
very
case,
that
was
so,
right?
because
the
--
the
period
for
discretionary
review
expired
in
august.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
mandate
issued
september
--
some
date
in
september.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
could
be
no
state
habeas
until
the
mandate
issued.
so
the
days
in
between
would
count
against
the
defendant
on
the
speedy
trial
clock
--
even
though
he
would
--
could
not
have
filed
a
state
habeas;
he
could
not
have
stopped
the
clock
by
filing
a
state
habeas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
someone
on
the
court
of
appeals
noticed
that
yes,
the
certificate
pinpoints
the
only
case,
only
question
that
the
panel
can
decide
at
this
juncture,
but
there
is
a
lurking
constitutional
question,
then
isn't
28
u.s.c.
1653
exactly
what
the
panel
would
do
then,
is
1653
says
that
detective
jurisdictional
allegations
can
be
amended
in
the
trial
or
the
appellate
court.
and
so
all
that
would
have
had
to
have
happened
is
very
much
in
line
with
justice
breyer's
questions,
is
that
the
judge
on
the
panel
said
oh,
certificate
of
appealability
didn't
make
it
a
speedy
trial
issue.
so
counsel,
would
you
like
to
amend,
or
we
on
our
own
will
amend
to
put
that
question
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
appeal
couldn't
go
forward
on
that
issue,
because
that
issue
hasn't
been
decided
below.
one
thing
we
know
is
with
speedy
trial
issues,
the
case
cannot
go
forward
on
the
speedy
trial
issue.
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
common
is
it
for
courts
of
appeals
to
reach
substantive
issues
in
the
first
instance?
there's
no
decision
of
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
most
sensible
procedure
be
--
let's
forget
the
efficacies
of
2244
and
53,
but
you
--
you
have
a
case
where
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
question
and
that
has
come
up
for
review.
wouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
99
out
of
100
times
say
now
the
substantive
--
since
we
have
decided
that
the
case
is
timely,
this
is
district
court's
function
to
resolve
the
substantive
issue?
