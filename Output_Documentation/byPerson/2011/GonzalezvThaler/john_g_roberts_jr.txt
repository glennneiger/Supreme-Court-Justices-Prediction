chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
no.
10-895,
gonzalez
v.
thaler.
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
he
had
identified
a
constitutional
issue,
speedy
trial
issue?
does
that
give
the
court
the
authority
to
consider
a
different
constitutional
issue,
fourth
amendment
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
it
identifies
something
that
is
not
remotely
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
by
the
terms
of
the
coa,
it's
quite
clear
that,
where
there's
a
state
law
issue
or
something
else,
there
is
no
constitutional
plausibility
on
the
face
of
it.
does
that
still
work
for
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mitchell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
only
fault
here
was
on
the
part
of
the
judge
and
not
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
it's
a
good
time.
you're
a
bit
more
than
halfway
through
your
argument.
maybe
it's
a
good
time
to
switch
to
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
finish
your
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
different
sentence.
[laughter]
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
a
court
of
appeals
--
if
a
court
of
appeals
judge
can
do
that,
can
we
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
read
--
you
read
that
to
be
any
circuit
justice,
or
only
the
circuit
justice
from
the
circuit
in
which
the
case
comes
from?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
because
justice
breyer
is
not
the
circuit
justice
for
the
fifth
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
millett,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
have
a
--
i
don't
understand
the
99
percent
figure.
that
includes
people
who
entered
a
plea
bargain
and
presumably
gave
up
the
right
to
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
99
percent
of
the
convictions
that
were
entered.
so
that
would
include
all
the
plea
bargains;
those
people
obviously
didn't
appeal,
is
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
opinions
this
morning
beginning
with
the
opinion
by
justice
sotomayor
in
case
10-895,
gonzalez
versus
phelan.
