justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
petitioner
asks
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
on
10
issues,
and
the
circuit
judge
says
i'm
granting
it
on
issue
1,
i'm
denying
it
on
issue
2
through
9,
2
through
10.
is
there
jurisdiction
to
consider
2
through
10?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
that
situation
then,
if
the
state
moves
to
dismiss
the
arguments
that
are
made
by
petitioner
on
issues
2
through
10,
would
the
--
would
the
panel
be
obligated
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
could
do
that
without
issuing
a
new
--
without
issuing
a
certificate
of
appealability,
without
saying
we
think
that
the
judge
who
issued
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
incorrect,
that
jurists
of
reason
could
disagree
on
issues
2
through
10?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
go
--
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
go
as
far
as
you
seem
to
be
going?
would
it
be
possible
to
read
(c)(3)
as
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
--
well,
i
understood
what
you
just
--
your
argument
to
be
that
it
doesn't
even
have
any
effect,
that
so
long
as
there
is
any
document
that's
called
the
certificate
of
appealability,
then
anything
can
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
panel
without
the
issuance
of
a
--
of
a
certificate
of
appealability
covering
the
issue.
but
if
it's
mandatory
but
not
jurisdictional,
then
if
the
state
moves
or
maybe
if
the
court,
if
the
panel
sue
sponte,
identifies
the
fact
that
there
may
be
an
error,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
a
new
certificate
of
appealability.
if
nothing
is
done,
then
--
then
there
isn't
a
problem.
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
issue
that
lingers
forever.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
panel
looks
at
the
merits
of
constitutional
issue,
as
to
which
there
is
a
reference
in
the
certificate
of
appealability
when
it
--
when
it
writes
its
opinion
it
first
has
to
ask
itself,
was
there
a
substantial
showing?
and
if
there
wasn't,
then
it
will
say
we'll
dismiss
this
claim.
and
then
--
but
if
it
says
well,
there
was
a
substantial
showing
but
it's
wrong,
then
we'll
affirm.
is
that
--
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
saying
99
percent
of
the
--
of
the
defendants
who
take
an
appeal
through
the
texas
system
don't
file
a
petition
with
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
or
is
it
99
percent
of
those
who
don't
do
that
and
then
file
a
federal
habeas
petition?
i
would
imagine
it's
the
former,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
