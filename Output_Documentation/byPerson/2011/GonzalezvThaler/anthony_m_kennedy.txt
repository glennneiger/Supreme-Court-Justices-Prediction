can
you
--
can
you
make
the
argument
--
does
it
help
you
--
in
distinguishing
the
notice
of
appeals
section,
to
--
to
say
that
the
notice
of
appeal
had
to
say
the
judgment
or
order
that's
being
appealed?
that's
almost
clerical.
it
doesn't
require
any
--
any
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
judge
or
extensive
review
of
the
record,
whereas
in
the
coa
there
has
to
be
an
element
of
judgment
in
deciding
what
the
constitutional
issue
is.
does
that
help
you
distinguish
the
two?
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
notice
of
appeals
cases
were
decided
before
our
--
our
case
indicating
that
it
has
to
be
clear
language.
