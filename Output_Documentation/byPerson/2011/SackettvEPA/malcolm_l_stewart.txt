mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
double
penalties
because
i
think
it
helps
to
clarify
exactly
what
the
compliance
order
does
and
does
not
do
in
terms
of
altering
the
legal
regime
to
which
the
sacketts
are
subject.
the
compliance
order
is
intended
to
specify
the
violation
that
epa
believes
to
have
occurred
and
the
measures
that
epa
believes
are
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
prospective
compliance.
and
the
statute
does
provide
separately
for
penalties
for
violating
the
statute
and
penalties
for
violating
the
compliance
order.
as
an
exercise
of
our
duty
of
candor
to
the
court,
we
acknowledged
in
our
brief
that
the
government
reads
the
statute
to
allow
the
legal
possibility
of
double
penalties,
that
is
up
to
$37,500
per
day
for
violating
the
statute,
up
to
37,500
per
day
for
violating
the
compliance
order.
i
think
that's
really
a
theoretical
rather
than
a
practical--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
language
in
the
order
would
have
been
accurate
even
if
the
statute
didn't
authorize
penalties
for
violating
the
order
itself.
that
is,
even
if
the
statute
authorized
penalties
only
for
violating
the
act,
it
would
have
been
accurate
for
epa
to
say:
we
believe
this
is
what
is
necessary
to
achieve
compliance
and
if
you
don't
do
it
you
will
potentially
be
subject
to
these
civil
penalties,
namely
civil
penalties
for
violating
the
statute.
but
the
reason
i
say
that
it's,
the
double
penalties,
is
a
theoretical
possibility
--
let
me
say
that
again.
if
there
were
no
provision
for
penalties
for
violating
the
compliance
order,
only
penalties
for
violating
the
statute,
epa
could
accurately
have
said:
we
believe
that
the
following
steps
are
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
perspective
compliance
with
the
act,
and
if
you
don't
do
these
things
you
will
be
subject
to
the
following
penalties
because
you
will
then
be
in
violation
of
the
act
and
you
will
be
subject
to
the
penalties--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
first
is
it
is
a
legal
possibility;
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
a
district
court
has
ever
imposed
penalties
of
greater
than
the
37,000--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
i
guess
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is
the
possibility
that
penalties
would
be
increased
doesn't
distinguish
this
scheme
from
the
sort
of
regime
that
justice
kennedy
referred
to
or
the
sort
of
regimes
that
we've
discussed
in
our
brief.
that
is,
it's
very
common
for
law
enforcement
agencies
of
all
sorts
to
give
warnings
to
regulated
parties:
we
think
you
are
violating
the
statute.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
have
not
adopted
a
policy
to
that
effect.
i
guess
what
i
do
want
to
clarify--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
two
--
i
don't
know
that
we
have
ever
asked
for
more
than
the
37,500
per
day.
now,
i
think
it
is
often
the
case
that
what
district
courts
will
do
is
within
the
37,500
statutory
maximum
they
will
say:
we
are
imposing
a
greater
penalty
for
the
period
after
the
compliance
order
was
issued
because
it
shows
greater
culpability
to
continue
with
the
violation
after
you
have
been
warned.
but
that's
not
a
feature
of
the
compliance
order
that
distinguishes
it
from
all
manner
of
other
agency--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
again,
we
don't
dispute
that
violating
the
order
could
as
a
realistic
matter
cause
the
penalties
to
be
greater
within
the
statutory
maximum.
but,
as
i
was
saying,
in
many
situations
agencies
give
warnings
to
regulated
parties:
if
you
keep
doing
this
you
may
be
subject
to
penalties.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
as
a
practical
matter
we
are
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
penalties
imposed
have
been
greater
than
the
per
day
statutory
maximum
provided--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
terms
--
i
think,
first
of
all,
we
would
say
that
until
we
floated
the
theoretical
possibility
in
our
opening
brief,
the
sacketts
seemed
to
be
entirely
unaware
of
it.
that
is,
all
of
the
sacketts
calculations
as
to
the
penalties
to
which
they
would
be
exposed
if
they
continue
to
engage
in
their
present
conduct
were
premised
on
the
idea
that
37,500
was
the
statutory
maximum.
but
the
main
point
i
want
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
that
--
i
guess
that's
really
my
point,
that
the
one
thing
the
sacketts
have
never
argued
is:
if
it
were
just
the
37,500
per
day
for
violating
the
statute,
we
would
be
willing
to
build
our
house
and
take
our
chances,
but
once
you
double
that
we
are
not
willing
to
take
the
risk
any
longer.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
the
one
point
before
i
move
on
that
i
do
want
to
make
clear
is,
in
a
wide
variety
of
contexts
agencies
will
issue
warnings
to
regulated
parties
that
they
are
believed
to
be
in
violation
of
a
statute.
and
it
is
common
under
schemes
where
the
amount
of
the
sanction
is
up
to
the
judge's
discretion
that
penalties
will
--
may
be
greater
for
conduct
that
occurs
after
the
person
has
been
warned.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
first
as
to
of
the
requirement
in
earlier
versions
of
the
compliance
order
that
herbaceous
plants
be
planted,
et
cetera,
those
were
removed
from--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--epa's
view
of
the
statute
is
that
without
regard
to
the
issuance
of
a
compliance
order,
once
fill
material
is
deposited
in
waters
of
the
united
states
epa's
view
of
the
penalty
provisions
would
be
that
the
violation
continues
for
as
long
as
the
fill
remains
in
the
wetlands.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
act
doesn't
specifically
--
and
the
act
doesn't
specifically
tell
the
person
to
remove
it,
but
that's
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
its
either
right
or
wrong.
that
is,
if
we
are
wrong
about
that,
if
the
only
days
on
which
penalties
can
be
assessed
for
violating
the
statute
itself
are
days
on
which
fill
was
actually
discharged,
then
the
provisions
of
the
compliance
order
that
directed
the
sacketts
to
remove
the
fill
and
restore
the
property
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
a
proper
compliance
order
under
13--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
our
view
as
well.
i'm
just
saying
that
hasn't
been
definitively
resolved
by
this
court.
but
the
position
that
we've
taken
again
with
respect
to
the
statute
itself
is
that
in
computing
the
daily
penalties
and
asking
how
many
days
of
violation
were
there,
the
district
court
should
take
into
account
not
just
the
days
on
which
fill
was
actually
deposited.
but
the
days
on
which
fill
remained
in
the
wetlands.
and
petitioners
have
specifically
expressed
agreement
this
morning
with
that
view
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
view
of
the
petitioners'
amici
is
to
the
same
effect,
because
in
many
of
the
amicus
briefs
there
are
calculations
of
the
very
large
penalties
to
which
people
could
be
subject
if
they
didn't
adhere
to
compliance
orders
and
they
are
all
premised
on
the
idea
that
every
day
fill
remains
in
the
wetlands--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
about
well
beyond.
i
think
--
every
version
of
the
compliance
order
said
to
the
sacketts:
if
you
think
that
there
are
things
in
here
that
are
wrong
or
compliance
measures
that
you
regard
as
infeasible,
you
are
welcome
to
tell
us.
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
portion
of
the
order
dealing
with
the
planting
of
plants,
which
is
the
primary
one
that
was
eliminated
in
the
final
iteration
of
the
order,
is
really
removed
from
what
the
sacketts
have
been
complaining
about.
that
is,
the
sacketts--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
in
the
main
what
every
version
of
the
compliance
order
required
was
appropriate
if
you
accept
the
initial
determination
that
there
was
a
violation
that
these
were
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
as
we
know
from
documents
that
have
--
were
not
in
the
record
of
the
case,
but
have
been
provided
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
at
that
stage
your
options
would
be
limited.
you
could
apply
for
an
after-the-fact
permit--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--or
you
could
simply
comply
with
the
compliance
order
at
the
cost
of,
it's
been
estimated,
$27,000.
once
the
compliance
order
has
been
resolved,
there
would
be
no
further
impediment--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
may
be
that
the
sacketts
at
that
point
were
in
an
unattractive
position.
but
i
think
in
determining
whether
it's
an
unfair
position
or
how
the
statutory
scheme
is
supposed
to
operate
we
ought
to
look
not
just
at
the
opportunities
that
were
available
to
them
at
that
moment
but
the
opportunities
that
they
had
forgone
already?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
as
a
matter
of
standard
epa
practice
the
compliance
order
would
not
be
the
first
communication
from
the
agency
that
would
alert
the
landowner
to
the
belief
that
there
was
a
violation.
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
make
clear
whether
that
agency
practice
was
followed
in
this
case,
but
epa's
typical
practice
is
to
alert
landowners
through
prior
communications
that
a
violation
is
existing.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
at
the
time
that
that
sort
of
letter
is
issued,
there
is
no
compliance
order
and
there
is
no
impediment
to
an
after-the-fact
permit.
that
is,
at
that
point
the
landowner
could
ask
for
a
permit.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
first
two
things
i
would
--
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
it's
not
simply
a
hypothetical
means
of
challenging
cwa
coverage
to
seek
a
permit.
that
is,
in
both
swancc,
solid
waste
agency
of
northern
cook
county
and
carabells,
which
was
one
of
the
two
companion
cases
that
this
court
adjudicated
in
rapanos,
that
was
the
way
that
the
suit
got
into
federal
court.
the
landowners
applied
for
permits,
they
were
denied,
they
sought
judicial
review
of
the
permit
denials
and
argued,
inter
alia,
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
permit
because
the
relevant
tracts
were
not
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
it's
often
the
case
that
judicial
review
is
contingent
upon
complying
with
some
sort
of
deadline
or
some
sort
of
prerequisite,
and
once
a
person
has
missed
the
deadline
that
person
may
as
a
practical
matter
be
in
the
same
position
as
if
judicial
review
had
not
been
made
available
at
all.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
would
issue
a
letter
either
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
wetland
or
that
it
was
a
wetland
that
was
not
covered
by--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
we
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
precluded,
but
i
would
agree
with
you:
it's
very
unlikely
that
without
complying
with
the
order--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
statute
precludes
all
judicial
review.
that
is,
the
question
whether
the
clean
water
act
applied
to
this
tract
could
have
been
keyed
up
for
a
court
in
either
of
two
ways.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
this
particular
order.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
first
because
the
order
doesn't
express
the
final
--
the
agency's
final
view
both
in
the
sense
that
it
invites
the
sacketts
to
provide
further
comment--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--epa
said
no
to
a
formal
hearing,
but
i
think
that
would
be
characteristic
agency
practice.
that
is,
when
the
agency
is
exercising
what
is
essentially
its
prosecutorial
function,
that
is,
warning
regulated
parties
we
may
do
--
we
may
sue
you
if
you
don't
do
the
following
things.
it
would
be
quite
common
for
enforcement
personnel
to
entertain
informal
overtures
from
the
regulated
party
or
his
legal
representative,
but
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary,
for
instance,
for
a
u.s.
attorney's
office
to
grant
a
formal
hearing
to
a
potential
criminal
defendant
in
order
to
discuss
the
--
in
order
to
resolve
the
question
criminal
charges
should
be
brought.
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
admin
--
the
agency's
normal
practice
would
be
to
issue
an
administrative
compliance
order
before
initiating
judicial
proceedings.
that
is,
the
statute
doesn't
require
it,
but
the
epa
ordinarily
would
not
commence
a
lawsuit
without
first
giving
the
regulated
party
one
final
opportunity
to
come
into
compliance.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
could
use
that.
it
would
typically
use
that
for
violations
that
it
perceived
to
be
less
serious.
the
statutory
cap
on
penalties
is
much
lower
than
the
cap
in
the
judicial
enforcement
actions.
i
think
it
would
probably
be
the
case
that
it
would
issue
an
administrative
compliance
order
in
those
situations
as
well.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
the
administrative
--
the
cover
letter
to
the
administrative
compliance
order
does
say
is:
even
if
you
comply,
you
are
still
not
immune
from
the
possibility
of
enforcement
proceedings
with
respect
to
past
violations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
oh,
absolutely.
i
mean,
there
is
no
express
statutory
authorization
for
that,
but
i
think
most
agencies
regard
it
as
within
their
ordinary
authority
to
enforce
the
statute
to
send
less
formal
communication.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
could
use
the
letter
for
that
mechanism.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
certainly
argue
there
would
be
no
review
of
that.
and
if
the
court
said
that
there
was
review
of
the
administrative
compliance
order
based
on
features
that
were
distinct
to
the
order,
namely,
the
fact
that
it
is
couched
as
an
order,
the
fact
that
penalties
can
be
imposed
for
violation
of
the
order
itself,
an
opinion
along
those
lines
wouldn't
suggest
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
don't
have
statistics
on
that.
now
--
24--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
--
i
would
have
the
impression
that
it's
in
a
nontrivial
number
of
cases,
the
landowner
does
approach
epa.
now
it's
--
4--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
will
say
that
the
statistics
i
do
have
are
that
only
a
very
small
percentage,
you
know,
a
rough
estimate
somewhere
on
the
order
of
3
%
of
wetlands-related
compliance
orders
under
of
the
clean
water
act
ultimately
culminate
into
lawsuits
for
enforcement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
would
encompass
both
the
cases
in
which
the
landowners
came
in
and
talked
to
epa
and
those
in
which
they
just
complied.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
you
are
right
as
a
matter
of
typical
agency
practice
that
there
would
be
an
invitation
well
before
the
compliance
order
was
issued
to
come
in
and
give
your
side
of
the
story,
and
you
are
probably
right
that
if
we
got
to
the
point
where
a
compliance
order
was
issued,
then
the
likelihood
that
further
communications
would
sway
the
agency
substantially
might
be
reduced.
so
i
would
take
your
point
there--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--so
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
guess
the
two
things,
one
of
which
may
be
more
troubling
rather
than
less
troubling,
is
to
say
that
if
you
are
troubled
by
this,
then
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
that
might
be
troubling
as
well.
because
it's
often
the
case
that
warnings
are
issued
to
regulated
parties,
and
it's
often
the
case
that
if
the
regulated
party
continues
with
the
conduct
after
receiving
the
warning,
the
penalties
may
be
enhanced.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
--
it
is
not
--
it
is
phrased
as
an
order.
but
the
only
thing
that
epa
is
authorized
to
do
under
section
1319(a)(3)
is
to
order
people
to
do
what
they
were
already
legally
complied
--
required
to
do.
that
is,
order
them
to
comply
with
their
legal
obligations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
is
no
--
the
court
has
held
that
there
is
no
constitutional
bar
to
that,
and
that
a
declaratory
judgment
remedy
can
be
made
available
in
that
circumstance.
but,
again,
i
think
it
would
cause
a
huge
upheaval
in
the
practices
of
many
agencies
to
say
that
declaratory
relief
is
typically
available
when
the
agency
issued
an
informal
warning.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
value
to
agencies
or
to
regulated
parties
to
encourage
the
agencies
to
hedge
their
bets
or
to
say
less
than
what
they
really
mean.
that
is
--
17--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
court
in
abbott
labs
emphasized
that
that
was
an
industry-wide
regulation
having
the
force
of
law
and
that
the
basis
for
challenging
it
was
a
purely
legal
ground.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
think
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
compliance
order
within
this
scheme
would
make
no
sense,
would
be
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
statutory
regime,
is
that
it
wouldn't
solve
the
problem.
as
the
discussion
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument
made
clear,
petitioners
share
our
view
that
the
administrative
compliance
order
would
be
subject
to
review
if
it's
reviewable
under
a
deferential
standard.
and
if
the
court
held
that
the
order
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
that
still
wouldn't
eliminate
the
possibility
that
if
we
pursued
an
enforcement
action
the
petitioners
could
argue
that
they
were
actually
in
violation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
more
than
just
is
it
wetlands.
it's
are
these
wetlands
that
have
the
requisite
connection
to
traditional
navigable
waters.
and
that
can
turn
in
part
on
factual
and
scientific
judgments.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
they
have
reached
that
conclusion
for
now.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
we
have
done
all
the
research
we
would
want
to
do
if
we
were
going
to
be
required
to
prove
up
our
case
in
court.
and
that's
really
the
second
half
of
the
--
the
problem,
that
if
petitioners
claim
were
reviewable
and
a
court
held
epa
didn't
do
sufficient
investigation
based
on
the
record
before
it
at
the
time,
there
was
no
sound
basis--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
--
i
would
assume
that
any
prosecutor,
any
enforcement
person,
would
want
to
be
better
prepared
when
a
case
actually
went
to
trial
then
when
he
was
communicating
to
the
potential
defendant
that
there's
a
real
likelihood
that
we
would
sue
you.
but
the
other--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--obviously,
we
would
feel
that
we
had
sufficient
evidence
for
doing
that.
but
the
second
part
of
the
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
is,
even
if
a
court
found
that
we
didn't
have
sufficient
evidence
before
us
at
the
time
the
administrative
compliance
order
was
issued,
and
that
the
order
was
therefore
arbitrary
and
capricious,
that
wouldn't
provide
the
sacketts
the
protection
that
they
needed,
because
that
wouldn't
foreclose
epa
from--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
--
i
guess
the
only
point
i
would
make
is,
if
petitioners
had
wanted
a
judicial
resolution
of
the
coverage
question
without
subjecting
themselves
to
potential
penalties,
they
could
have
filed
a
permit
application
before
discharging,
they
could
have
gotten
review
there.
all
we're
saying
is
they
can't
discharge
fill,
wait
to
see
whether
epa
notices,
and
then
insist
upon
immediate
judicial
review
if
epa
notices
and
objects.
