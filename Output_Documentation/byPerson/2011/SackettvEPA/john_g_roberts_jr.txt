chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1062,
sackett
v.
the
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
schiff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
sanction
imposed
each
day
was
not
the
$37,000,
but
was
$10.
if
you
don't
comply,
you
know,
we
can
bring
an
action
any
time
to
enforce
this
and
you'll
be
subject
to
the
statutory
maximum,
but
during
the
period,
the
additional
sanction
for
the
--
under
the
administrative
order,
or
the
compliance
order,
is
$10
a
day?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
might
go
to
adequacy
of
judicial
review,
the
adequacy
of
the
judicial
review
that
would
come
when
the
apa
brings
the
enforcement
action.
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
there
was
a
significant
extortion
impact
from
the
fact
that
these
were
such
significant
fines
--
doubled,
as
you
say
--
that
you
could
rack
up
for
5
years.
but
if
it's
only
$10
a
day,
that
takes
a
lot
of
the
wind
out
of
your
sails,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
--
i
don't
understand
what
exactly
you
might
get
from
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
obviously,
they
might
give
you
a
permit,
and
i
take
it
that
cuts
off
liability;
you
can
do
what
you're
hoping
to
do.
they
might
say
you
don't
get
a
permit
because
these
are
wetlands.
can
they
do
something
in
the
middle,
which
is:
it's
kind
of
hard
for
us
to
tell;
you're
on
your
own?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
collateral
estoppel
apply
to
you
because
of
the
judicial
determination
on
the
compliance
order
in
the
subsequent
enforcement
action?
in
other
words,
you
lose.
you
seek
apa
review
and
the
court
says:
we
think
it's
a
wetland.
and
then
the
epa
brings
an
enforcement
action.
they
have
to
establish
it's
a
wetland.
don't
they
just
attach
a
copy
of
the
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i
am
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
this
--
it
struck
me
as
a
purely
legal,
jurisdictional
issue,
are
these
wetlands
or
not?
and
i
don't
know
why
you
give
deference
to
the
agency's
determination
on
a
legal
jurisdictional
issue
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
follow
--
i
didn't
follow
that.
what
is
your
response
to
the
assertion
that
you
are
subject
to
double
penalties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
for
violating
the
act,
two
for
violating
the
compliance
order.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
doubt
that
--
you
don't
doubt
that
they
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
their
argument
today,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
referred
a
couple
of
times
to
the
epa's
view
of
the
statute.
i
take
it
that's
your
view
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
you
--
what
would
you
do,
mr.
stewart,
if
you
received
this
compliance
order?
you
don't
think
your
property
has
wetlands
on
it
and
you
get
this
compliance
order
from
the
epa.
what
would
you
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
weren't
in
the
record,
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
them.
you
appreciate
that
rule,
that
we
don't
consider
things
that
aren't
in
the
record.
you
get
a
compliance
order,
you
don't
think
your
property
has
wetlands,
what
do
you
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
wouldn't
do
that,
right?
you
know
you
will
never
get
an
after-the-fact
permit
if
the
epa
has
sent
you
a
compliance
order
saying
you've
got
wetlands.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
you
would
do?
you
would
say,
i
don't
think
there
are
wetlands
on
my
property
but
epa
does,
so
i'm
going
to
take
out
all
the
fill,
i'm
going
to
plant
herbaceous
trees
or
whatever
it
is,
and
i
will
worry
about
whether
to
--
that
way,
i'll
just
do
what
the
government
tells
me
i
should
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
what
the
landowner
is
supposed
to
do
--
the
agency
says,
because
you
didn't
apply
for
a
permit,
you
are
in
trouble,
because
you
didn't
give
us
a
chance
to
say
whether
we
were
going
to
take
away
your
constitutional
rights
or
not,
so
we
can
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
that's
right.
in
other
words,
you
hope
you
have
--
you've
looked
at
it,
you
hope
you
have
a
sufficient
basis.
and
because
of
the
administrative
compliance
order,
you're
really
never
going
to
be
put
to
the
test,
because
most
land
owners
aren't
going
to
say,
i'm
going
to
risk
the
$37,000
a
day.
all
epa
has
to
do
is
make
whatever
finding
it
wants,
and
realize
that
in
99
percent
of
the
cases,
it's
never
going
to
be
put
to
the
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schiff,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
in
case
10-1062,
sackett
versus
epa.
