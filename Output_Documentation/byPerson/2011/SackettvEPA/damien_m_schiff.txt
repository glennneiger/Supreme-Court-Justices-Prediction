mr.
damien
m.
schiff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mike
and
chantell
sackett
are
here
today
because
4
years
ago
the
environmental
protection
agency
issued
against
them
a
compliance
order
charging
them
with
violations
of
the
clean
water
act,
requiring
that
they
restore
their
property
to
its
alleged
predisturbance
wetlands
condition,
and
imposing
upon
them
the
threat
of
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
per
day
in
civil
fines
if
they
did
not
immediately
comply
with
the
order.
but
in
these
4
years,
the
sacketts
have
never
been
offered
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
judicial
review
of
the
compliance
order,
an
opportunity
that
they
are
guaranteed
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
justice
scalia,
the
fine
would
only
have
been
attributable
to
the
statute
itself.
but
with
the
compliance
order
in
effect,
essentially,
the
sacketts
are
now
subject
to
double
liability.
they
can
be
held
liable
for
the
statute
as
well
as
for
actions
inconsistent
with
the
compliance
order.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
yes
--
yes,
justice
kagan.
and
it
is
--
it
is
in
fact,
i
might
add,
how
the
epa
understands
the
penalty
provisions.
in
its
brief
at
pages
30
and
31,
they
essentially
concede
that
the
existence
of
the
compliance
order
does
subject
the
sacketts
to
liability
for
both
violations
of
the
statute
as
well
as
violations
of
the
compliance
order.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
court
held
that
as
a
predicate
for
any
liability
for
a
compliance
order
violation,
there
must
be
first
a
finding
of
a
statutory
violation.
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact,
even
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
one
can
still
be
held
liable
for
both,
that
there
is
a
distinct
civil
liability
that
is
traceable
only
to
the
compliance
order.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
no,
your
honor,
we
seek
review
of
that
jurisdictional
question
as
it
is
incorporated
into
the
compliance
order.
the
compliance
order
is
the
agency
action
for
which
we
believe
the
sacketts
have
a
right
of
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
our
challenge
under
the
apa
to
the
compliance
order
is
precisely
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore
there
has
been
no
statutory
violation.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
well,
justice
kennedy,
we
do
not
believe
that
what
we
are
articulating
extends
as
far
as
--
as
creating
a
right
under
the
apa
for
review
because
a
health
inspector
has
come
onto
your
property.
all
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
compliance
order
is
a
final
agency
action,
it
has
stopped
the
sacketts
home
building,
it
has
imposed
upon
them
significant
civil
liability,
and
therefore
they
should
have
a
right
under
the
apa--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--correct.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
correct,
justice
kennedy.
and
we
should
emphasize
that
we
believe
that
the
sacketts'
due
process
rights
can
be
satisfied
by
allowing
their
apa
cause
of
action
to
go
forward.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
scalia.
that
is
--
that's
the
principal
distinction
between
the
compliance
order
in
this
case
and
many
of
the
agency
actions
that
the
epa
has
set
forth
in
its
brief.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
would
change
the
court's
finality
analysis
under
bennett.
the
--
the
fact
that
the
fine
is
only
$10
as
opposed
to
$37,000
doesn't--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
to
begin
with,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
addition
to
the
independent
liability
that
the
compliance
order
imposes,
there
are
other
legal
effects.
even
if
the
compliance
order
had
no
independent
liability,
there
are
other
legal
effects
that
even
epa
has
conceded
to.
for
example,
the
existence
of
the
compliance
order
makes
it
materially,
substantially
more
difficult
for
the
sacketts
to
apply
for
an
after-the-fact
permit.
a
higher--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--for
an
after-the-fact
permit.
the
--
once
an
compliance
order
is
issued,
an
after-the-fact
permit
is
--
can
only
be
applied
for
under
the
"clearly
appropriate"
standard
in
the
corps'
regulations.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
the
question,
yes,
of
course,
the
amount
of
the
fine
certainly
factors
into
meaningfulness
of
review.
it
factors
into
coerciveness.
but
even
if
there
were
no
fines,
there
is
--
attributable
to
the
compliance
order,
there
is
still
the
fact
that
the
sacketts
cannot
independently
initiate,
cannot
trigger
review
of
a
compliance
order.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
the
difficulty,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
sacketts
cannot
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
compliance
order
within
the
context
of
the
permitting
process.
the
compliance
order
is
the
order
that
has
caused
the
deprivation,
that
is
imposed
upon
the
sacketts
this
double
liability.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that
issue
might
be
raised,
your
honor,
but
the
sacketts
could
never
get
review
of
that
issue
within
the
context
of
the
compliance
order,
which
is,
of
course,
the
agency
action
that
has
caused
their
harm.
moreover,
there
is
frankly
no
guarantee
that
the
sacketts
could
even
get
into
court
through
the
permitting
process,
because
the
corps
might
very
well
say:
well,
you
know,
we
don't
believe
that
there
are
wetlands
on
the
property,
and
so
we
are
not
going
to
issue
you
a
permit,
and
therefore
there
is
nothing
for
the
sacketts
to
then
litigate
over
in
federal
court.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
there
is
--
there
is
a
study,
your
honor
--
in
terms
of
averages,
i
think
it
is
about
a
year.
but
there's
nothing
in
our
record
that
would
show
necessarily
that
the
sacketts
are
eligible
for
a
nationwide
permit.
but
more
importantly
is
the
fact
that
the
permitting
process
doesn't
provide
review
of
the
burden
of
the
deprivation
that
the
sacketts
are
enduring
right
now.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
very
much
so.
in
addition
to
saying
we're
not
going
to
issue
a
permit
because
we
don't
believe
there
are
wetlands
on
the
property,
they
could
also
say
--
under
the
regulations
that
epa
cites
in
its
brief
--
that
we're
not
even
going
to
entertain
your
after-the-fact
permit
application
while
the
compliance
order
is
still
outstanding,
meaning
that
you
will
likely
have
to
comply,
be
fully
deprived,
with
everything
the
compliance
order
says,
allow
epa
on
to
your
property,
requiring
significant
expensive
restoration
of
your
property
to
its
alleged
wetlands,
state,
before
you
even
have
the
privilege
of
applying
for
a
permit.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
no,
it
would
not,
justice
kagan,
because,
again,
the
fact
is
that
the
--
the
compliance
order
is
--
well,
the
permitting
process
is
an
entirely
separate
agency
action.
it's
--
it's
an
agency
action
that
the
army
corps
goes
through.
the
sacketts
could
get
no
review
of
the
--
of
the
compliance
order.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
justice
kagan,
the
difficulty
is
that
that
judicial
decision
would
have
no
impact
and
would
not
remedy
the
deprivation
that
the
sacketts
are
currently
enduring.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that's
my
understanding.
the
corps
would
simply
state
there
is
nothing
to
permit
because
there
are
no
wetlands
to
fill.
but--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--the
difficulty,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
we
are
talking
about
two
agencies.
and
this
--
this
is
really
the
--
why
--
one
additional
reason
why
the
permitting
process
is
--
is
an
inapt
solution
to
the
sacketts'
problem.
the
sacketts
have
been
injured
by
epa,
by
the
compliance
order.
and
now--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--that's
--
that's
exactly
right,
justice
alito.
the
--
that
underscores
how
bizarre
it
is
to
force
the
sacketts
to
go
through
a
process.
they
have
been
injured
by
the
epa,
by
a
compliance
order,
and
they
are
told
they
must
initiate
an
entirely
separate
administrative
action
with
an
entirely
different
agency
in
order
to
get
indirect,
tangential,
possible
review
of
the
compliance
order
that
has
turned
their
world
upside
down
for
the
last
4
years?
the
--
that
is
why
the
permitting
process
cannot
provide
meaningful
judicial
review
to
the
sacketts.
that's
why
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
the
ready-made
answer.
and
frankly,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
anything
other
than
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
provide
an
adequate
administrative
review
for
the
--
for
the
adjudication
of
compliance
orders.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
would
be
your
typical
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
review,
substantial
evidence
based
upon
the
record
that
was
before
the
epa
when
it
made
its
finding
of
statutory
violation,
which
is
the
statutory
predicate
for
the
issuance
of
the
complaint.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
no,
exactly,
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
to
limit
ourselves
to
just
that
one
standard
of
review.
but
it
would
be
a--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
i
certainly
hope
not,
justice
scalia.
but
--
but
the
difficulty
is
we
don't
even
know
at
this
point
what
sort
of
record
the
epa
has.
in
fact,
the
law
as
it
stands
now
is
that
epa
doesn't
even
need
probable
cause
to
issue
a
compliance
order.
and--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--there
is
no
question,
justice
alito,
that
there
--
there
--
yes,
it
would
be
a
difficult
time.
but
that,
just
because
the
sacketts
might
have
an
uphill
battle
i
don't
believe
is
any
reason
to
say
that
they
should
have
no
opportunity.
i
mean,
as
it
stands
now,
they
have
been
told
you
cannot
build
your
home,
you
must
convert
your
property
into
wetlands,
and
you
are
being
charged
$37,500
per
day
if
you
don't
immediately
comply;
and
yet
you
get
no
day
in
court?
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
yes.
the
only
way
epa
can
actually
take
money
away
from
the
sacketts
is
by
filing
a
civil
action,
but
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
the
sacketts
bring
an
apa
cause
of
action.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
well,
not
necessarily
mr.
chief
justice,
because,
one,
the
standard
of
review
would
be
different.
it
would
be
--
under
the
apa,
it
would
be
the
traditional
deference
afforded
to
agency
action.
not--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--no,
you
are
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
more
in
terms
of
the
substantial
evidence
standard
that
usually
supports
agency
action
under
the
apa.
but
--
but
certainly
here
the
sacketts
also
contend,
regardless
of
questions
of
rapanos
and
connection
to
navigable
waters,
the
sacketts
contend
that
there
are
no
wetlands
at
all
on
this
property,
and
that
ultimately
is
--
is
of
course
a
factual
question
that
would
be
informed
by
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
no.
i
mean
--
justice
kennedy,
we
would
argue
that,
even
if
there
are
wetlands
on
the
property,
which
we
do
not
believe
there
are,
that
--
that
the
compliance
order
would
still
be
invalidated
if
there
were
not
a
significant
nexus
between
the
--
the
alleged
wetlands
on
the
property
and
some
navigable
water
in
the
vicinity.
but
--
but--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
at
that
point
then
both
sides
get
to
create
a
new
record,
consistent
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
held.
that--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--no.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
standards
of
review
would
be
different,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
a
civil
action
as
opposed
to
substantial
evidence
in
the
apa,
it
would
also
be
the
fact
that
--
that,
even
as
the
ninth
circuit
understood
a
civil
action,
when
it
goes
forward
both
sides
have
an
opportunity
to
create
a
new
record,
or
to
--
to
establish
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
the
elements
of
--
of
the
offense.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--it
--
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
case
of
estoppel,
because
again,
in
the
apa
context
it's
just
based
upon
the
record
at
the
time
the
compliance
order
is
issued.
and
so
the
records
are
always
going
to
be
different,
because
the
civil
action
will
build
upon
that
administrative
record.
and
then
secondly.
in
terms
of
the
differing
standards
of
review,
i
suppose
one
could
find
a
--
a
purely
factual
question
perhaps
that
--
that
where
the
standards
of
review
wouldn't
matter,
or
a
purely
legal
question,
but--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--yes,
justice
scalia,
to
some
extent
it
is,
of
course,
the
process
that
--
that--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--it
--
it
--
it
does
indeed,
and
so
even
if
the
sacketts
on
remand
don't
get
their
ideal
mode
of
judicial
review,
something
is
frankly
better
than
nothing.
they
have
been
told
for
4
years
they
cannot
build
their
home,
they
have
been
threatened
with
ruinous
civil
penalties,
and
to
date
they
have
had
no
opportunity
for
their
day
in
court.
the
--
the
sacketts
cannot
trigger
an
enforcement
action.
i
mean,
perhaps
if
congress
had
written
the
statute
differently
to
allow
for
some
sort
of
judicial
review
that
the
sacketts
could
--
could
initiate
for
a
compliance
order,
that
might
--
that
might
answer,
justice
scalia,
your
--
your
concerns.
but
that
is
not
the
statute
we
have.
we
have
a
statute
where
congress
has
said
epa
can
issue
a
compliance
order,
and
we
have
in
combination
with
that
the
presumption
in
favor
of
judicial
review
of
final
agency
action;
we
have
the
avoidance
canon;
all
that
point
to
allowing
for
the
sacketts
to
get
their
day
in
court
and
at
the
same
time
to
satisfy
and
to
vindicate
congress's
intent.
congress
wanted
epa
to
be
able
to
issue
these
--
these
compliance
orders.
congress
gave
significant
statutory
penalties
for
violating
these
compliance
orders.
but
at
the
same
time,
there
has
to
be
balance.
one
cannot
tell
landowners--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--no;
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
that's--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
respectfully,
justice
scalia,
it's
more
than
rolling
the
dice.
it's
subjecting
the
--
the
sacketts
to
an
interminable
damoclean
sword.
if
--
if
the
only
way
they
can
get
review
is
simply
waiting,
well,
when
will
epa
let
the
sword
drop
and
bring
a
civil
action
to
enforce
its
compliance
order?
who
knows
how
long
it
is?
with
epa's
theory
of
continuing
violation,
the
statute
of
limitations
never
even
runs.
and
so
you
have
the
sacketts
who
are
forever
subject
to
this
cloud
over
themselves,
cloud
over
their
title
--
they
can't
get
anyone
to
come
on
to
their
property
to
build
their
home.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
as
--
justice
ginsburg,
as
epa
interprets
the
statute
of
limitations
for
collecting
civil
penalties,
so
long
as
the
"discharge",
quote
unquote,
remains
in
place,
it
is
considered
a
continuing
limitation,
and
so
the
statute
of
limitations
never
even
begins
to
run.
and
so
sacketts
might
build
their
home
and
10
years
down
the
road
be
surprised
that
here
comes
epa
with
its
civil
action.
oh,
now
the
sacketts
get
judicial
review,
but
at
a
significant
cost.
they
can't
even
enjoy
the
home
that
they
might
build
because
there
is
always
this
cloud
hanging
over
them,
a
cloud
that
can
be
dispelled
if
they
can
simply
have
an
opportunity,
which,
justice
scalia,
may
not
be
the
best
opportunity,
but
something
is
better
than
nothing,
an
apa
cause
of
action
to
review
the
epa's
assertion
of
its
authority
over
their
property.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
allow
me
to
clarify,
justice
ginsburg.
in
this
apa
cause
of
action,
the
sacketts
challenge
the
jurisdictional
predicate,
and
that
is
really
a
two-part
determination.
one
is,
are
there
wetlands
on
the
property;
and
two,
are
those
wetlands
sufficiently
connected
to
navigable
waters
to
justify
federal
regulation.
and
both
of
those
fit
into
our
first
claim
for
relief,
our
apa
cause
of
action.
and
so
in
this
case
that
is
what
our
apa
cause
of
action
on
remand
would
look
like.
we
would
say
let's
look
at
the
record
that
epa
has
assembled
at
the
time
it
issued
the
compliance
order
and
does
that
record
support
the
finding
of
statutory
violation.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that
is
correct,
justice
sotomayor,
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
all
that
we
are
challenging.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
difficulty
is
essentially
of
epa's
own
creation.
i
don't
understand
why
--
why
epa
would
want
the
power
to
issue
compliance
orders
that,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
are
--
are
tremendously
coercive.
and
that
has--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--i
think,
justice
breyer,
the
fear
of
it
being
too
pro-homeowner
is
in
fact
protected
by
the
fact
of
the
apa
standard
of
review.
we're
not
talking
about
--
about
the
agency
being
forced
to
sort
of
a--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--you're
correct,
justice
scalia.
if
there
is
no
record,
certainly
there's
by
necessity
no
substantial
evidence,
and
in
that
case,
the
compliance
order
would
be--
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
--i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor,
but
--
justice
kennedy
--
but
--
as
this
court
i
believe
held
in
riverside
bayview,
a
takings
claim
under
the
clean
water
act
is
not
considered
ripe
until
a
permit
application
has
been
--
has
been
attempted.
now,
if
a
compliance
order
is
issued,
then
the
permit
application
might
be
off
the
table.
and
in
fact,
one
can
see
that
a
compliance
order
might
potentially
have
a
total
taking
effect
in
this
case.
but
certainly
at
this
point,
we
are
willing
to
let
epa
have
the
power.
yes,
let
epa
administer
the
act
and
issue
compliance
orders.
but
let's
also
give
homeowners
a
fair
shake,
too.
let
them
have
their
day
in
court
to
contest
what
the
agency
has
done.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
we
--
justice
kagan,
we
don't
deny
that
by
applying
for
a
permit
and
having
the
corps
make
a
decision
on
the
permit
that
that's
one
way
to
get
into
court.
but
the
difficulty
for
the
sacketts
and
for
the
thousands
of
folks
in
this
country
who
are
recipients
of
compliance
orders
is
that
that's
small
or
no
solace
once
epa
has
already
acted.
you
know,
once
epa
has
made
the
finding
of
violation
and
then
threatens
these
ruinous
penalties
on
landowners.
mr.
damien
m.
schiff
that's
correct,
justice
kagan.
but
frankly,
the
way
epa
and
the
corps
interpret
the
scope
of
their
jurisdiction,
that
would
make
essentially
every
landowner
in
this
country
potentially
on
notice
requiring
them
to
apply
for
a
permit
or
some
other
manner
and
the
agency
would
then
probably
have
even
a
worse
situation;
it
would
be
flooded
by
permits.
