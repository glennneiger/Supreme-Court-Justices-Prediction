can
you
tell
me,
what
--
what
would
be
the
scope
of
your
holding?
how
would
--
how
would
--
if
you
could
write
the
opinion
for
the
court
on
this
part
of
your
case,
what
would
the
rule
be?
i
mean,
health
inspectors
go
into
restaurants
all
the
time
and
say:
unless
you
fix
this,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
citation.
fire
inspectors,
the
same
thing.
and
i
am
--
i'm
wondering
how
your
general
theory
or
your
general
principle
that
you
want
us
to
adopt
would
fit
with
that
rather
routine
type
of
enforcement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
is
under
--
under
the
apa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
apa
prong
of
your
argument.
justice
anthony

kennedy
to
apply
for
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
then
the
compliance
order
would
automatically
be
vacated?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
compliance
order
presume
that
they
are
wetlands?
hasn't
the
agency
already
made
that
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
are
wrong
about
that,
if
there
is
a
finding
in
the
apa
process
that
these
are
wetlands,
is
that
the
end
of
it?
or
within
that,
the
context
of
that
review,
can
you
say,
well,
they
are
wetlands,
but
only
to
a
minor
extent,
and
these
conditions
were
onerous
and
--
and
far
more
than
necessary
to
protect
the
wetlands?
can
you
argue
that
in
the
apa
review,
or
is
it
just
up
or
down,
wetlands
you
lose,
not
wetlands
you
win,
that's
it?

they

they
are
getting
a
good
night's
sleep
before
they
read
your
brief?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts
where
landowners,
having
received
these
notices
or
compliance
orders,
are
said
that
there's
a
taking
of
the
property,
inverse
condemnation?
