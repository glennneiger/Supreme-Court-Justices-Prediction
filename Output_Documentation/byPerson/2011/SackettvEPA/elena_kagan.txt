so,
mr.
schiff,
your
understanding
is
that
each
day
your
clients
are
subject
to
$37,500
of
fines
for
the
violation
of
the
statute,
and
an
additional
37.5
for
violation
of
the
compliance
order?
is
that
the
way
you
understand
the
penalty
scheme
to
work?
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
--
is
that
what's
critical,
mr.
schiff?
if
that
were
not
true,
if
you
could
go
in,
even
with
the
compliance
order
on
your
property,
and
get
an
adjudication
of
whether
you
had
wetlands
in
the
context
of
an
after-the-fact
permit
proceeding,
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
elena
kagan
so
why
does
that
matter?
you're
getting
review
of
the
question
that
you
care
about,
which
is
the
question
whether
you
have
wetlands
on
your
property.
and
if
they
said
you
don't
have
wetlands
on
your
property,
here's
a
permit,
your
problems
are
finished.
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
schiff,
is
the
way
you
see
this
operating
that
you
bring
an
action
contesting
on
the
basis
of
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
clause
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law?
if
then
the
court
rules
against
you
but
you
continue
to
fail
to
comply,
does
the
epa
then
have
to
bring
a
separate
enforcement
action?
justice
elena
kagan
but
to
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's--
justice
elena
kagan
--so
the
chief
justice's
suggestion
that
there
would
be
preclusion
you
do
not
agree
with?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
stewart--
justice
elena
kagan
you
are
arguing
that
the
presumption
of
reviewability
does
not
apply.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that
seems
a
very
strange
position.
why
would
the
presumption
of
reviewability
not
apply?
justice
elena
kagan
but
doesn't
most
of
--
14--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
mr.
stewart,
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
stewart,
you
suggested
that,
that
some
communication
occurs
before
this
compliance
order.
and
my
guess
would
be
that
most
of
the
back
and
forth
between
the
agency
and
the
person
does
happen
before
the
compliance
order
rather
than
after.
and
the
notion
that
the
person
can
come
in
after
the
compliance
order
and
say
you
were
wrong,
well
they
can,
but
they
can
do
that
with
respect
to
any
administrative
action.
so,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
that
really
the
back
and
forth
here
takes
place
before
the
compliance
order
issues
rather
than
after?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schiff,
i
take
it
that
the
government
agrees
that
there's
not
much
of
a
chance
that
you
could
get
an
after-the-fact
permit,
but
its
view
is
you
should
have
gotten
a
before-the-fact
permit.
and
putting
aside
the
weirdness
which
justice
alito
points
out
of
making
you
go
get
a
permit
for
something
you
don't
think
you
need
a
permit
for
--
putting
that
aside,
couldn't
you
have
gotten
the
legal
determination
that
you
wanted
through
that
process?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
what
epa
is
saying
was,
as
long
as
you
knew
that
your
lands
were
potentially
wetlands,
you
could
have
gone
in
from
the
get-go
and
--
and
sought
a
determination
that
they
were
not
wetlands
through
the
permit
process.
