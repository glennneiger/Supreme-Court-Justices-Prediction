justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
"practical".
the
order
itself
says
that.
it
says
you
don't
do
it
you
are
going
to
get
penalized
32.5,
which
is
now
37.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
they
bring
an
action
--
i
would
like
some
clarification
here.
the
corps's
regs
say
the
corps
will
accept
an
after-the-fact
permit.
i
mean
one
after
--
if
they
applied
tomorrow,
the
day
after
getting
this
order,
you
would
run
up
against
the
reg,
which
says
we
won't
give
you
any
after
the
fact,
we
won't
even
consider
this
matter,
until
any
required
initial
corrective
measures
are
made.
and
then,
just
to
be
safe,
they
say
that
no
permit
application
will
be
accepted
unless
the
corps
determines
that
concurrent
processing
of
an
after-the-fact
permit
application
is
clearly
appropriate,
"clearly".
so
i
looked
at
those
two
things
and
said:
of
course
you
can't
apply
to
the
corps
of
engineers;
they
are
not
going
to
accept
it
unless
you
have
a
very
unusual
case.
so
i
expect
you
to
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong
about
that,
if
i
am,
or
how
many
after-the-fact
permit
applications
has
the
corps
of
engineers
accepted.
maybe
there
are
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i
agree.
if
we
agree
then,
look,
for
75
years
the
courts
have
interpreted
statutes
with
an
eye
towards
permitting
judicial
review,
not
the
opposite.
and
yet
--
so
here
you
are
saying
that
this
statute
that
says
nothing
about
it
precludes
review,
and
then
the
second
thing
you
say
is
that
this
isn't
final.
so
i
read
the
order.
it
looks
like
about
as
final
a
thing
as
i
have
ever
seen.
so
tell
me
why
i
am
wrong
on
those
two
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
arguing
on
the
final
part--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
you've
got
by
--
i
mean,
i'm
--
you've
got
me
now
into
the
area,
we
are
applying
the
apa
and
the
question
is
abbott
labs
and
is
it
final.
well,
here
there
doesn't
seem
anything
more
for
the
agency
to
do,
and
here
the
person
whom
the
order
is
directed
against
is
being
hurt
a
lot.
so
the
only
thing
i
--
left
in
my
mind
here
is
the
order
itself
does
say:
come
in
and
talk
to
us
about
this.
which
may
suggest
it
isn't
final.
so
do
you
have
any
information
on
that
point?
that
is,
have
you
looked
up
or
has
the
apa
told
you
that
really
when
we
issue
these
things,
in
fact
people
come
in
and
modify
them
at
x
percent
of
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
impression
that
you
could
tell
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
not
a
warning.
i
mean,
you
only
have
to
look
at
it.
i
was
quite
moved
by
the
fact
when
i
looked
at
it,
it
didn't
say
a
warning.
it
said:
this
is
an
order.
it
looks
extremely
formal.
i
even
overstated
in
your
favor
the
question
of
negotiating
because
it
doesn't
say
negotiating
about
changing
the
order;
it
says
negotiating
about
amending
the
order.
and
--
so
this
is
not
just
a
warning,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
more
--
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
you
to
talk
about
just
for
one
minute.
you
are
talking
about
a
huge
upheaval.
my
honest
impression
is
that
it
is
the
government
here
that
is
fighting
75
years
of
practice
because
--
because
the
issue
is
the
abbott
labs
issue
of
finality.
and
of
course
a
warning
isn't
reviewable.
but
this
seems
to
meet
the
test
where
that
fails.
now
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
about
the
agency
practice.
i
can't
find
support
for
you
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
do,
actually,
because
i
see
their
point
better
than
i
did.
this
is
--
is
i
think
they
are
worried
about.
they're
worried
that
when
you
get
judicial
review
of
this
kind
of
order,
the
court
doesn't
refer
on
fact-finding
that
isn't
made
on
a
record.
the
substantial
evidence
test
applies
to
fact-finding
made
on
a
record,
or
a
556/557.
and
so
they'll
have
a
hard
time
--
or
a
harder
time
--
in
each
of
these
cases
subjecting
it
to
judicial
fact-finding.
and
they
think
that
the
purpose
of
this,
the
purpose
of
this
procedure
given
to
them
by
statute
was
to
call
it
--
the
shots
in
favor
of
them,
because
there
might
be
thousands
of
these
things
and
they
can't
prepare
all
that
formal
thing.
now,
i
--
i
see
that
as
a
--
as
a
--
now
i
understand
their
concern.
i'm
not
saying
they're
right.
i
understand
their
concern.
so
if
you
want
to
comment,
is
there
some
way
to
accommodate
their
concern
that
also
accommodates
judicial
review,
or
are
we
just
in
a
kind
of
--
they're
in
a
hobson's
choice,
in
a
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
want
the
power
because
they
have
thousands
of
these
things.
they
investigate
it,
and
they
find
the
facts.
they
think
it's
sufficient
that
judicial
fact-finding
is
carried
out
before
a
judge
who
doesn't
have
their
experience,
et
cetera.
and
therefore,
there
is
a
risk
of
incorrect
decision-making,
at
least
two
--
under
the
statute,
it
would
be
too
pro-homeowner
rather
too
pro-environment.
that's
why
it
is
more
of
a
dilemma
than
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
--
they
might
--
the
might
change
their
--
their
system
here
if
you
--
if
you
win
this,
and
provide
for
various
kinds
of
preorder
procedure
or
post-order
procedure
where
they
would
be
open
to
change.
i
see
a
number
of
possibilities.
