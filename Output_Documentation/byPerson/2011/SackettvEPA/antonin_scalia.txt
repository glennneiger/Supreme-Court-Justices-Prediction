justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
there
would
have
been
a
daily
fine
with
or
without
the
compliance
order,
wouldn't
there,
if
they
were
indeed
in
violation
of
the
--
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
there's
another
distinction,
a
more
significant
one,
between
routine
inspections
by
fire
marshals
or
--
or
restaurant
inspectors,
and
that
is
that
if
you
--
if
you
disobey
their
order,
you're
not
subjected
to
any
more
substantial
liability
than
--
than
you
would
have
been
subjected
to
had
they
not
issued
the
order.
it
isn't
the
order
that
--
that
produces
any
--
any
new
fine,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
--
what
do
you
care?
i
mean,
you
have
the
fines,
don't
you?
so
why
don't
you
just
argue
that?
why
do
we
have
to
wrestle
with
the
more
difficult
situation
where
there
are
no
fines?
it's
conceded
that
there
are
fines,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
know,
sufficient
unto
the
day
the
evil
thereof.
we
don't
have
to
consider
more
difficult
cases.
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
can
get
review
by
applying
for
an
after-the-fact
permit
from
the
corps,
and
the
only
--
the
only
expense
you
would
incur
in
order
to
get
that
would
be
to
fill
in,
as
the
order
requires
you
to
do,
which
is
something
like
what,
$27,500
or
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
such
a
hard
--
a
hard
hit?
that's
a
lot
less
than,
you
know,
37.5
a
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
their
challenge
to
the
compliance
order
is
simply
that
they
don't
have
wetlands.
it's
the
jurisdiction
of
the
epa.
and
surely
that
can
be
raised
in
the
--
before
the
corps
of
engineers,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
one
of
those
after-the-fact
permits?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
issue
permits
when
there
are
no
wetlands?
i
thought
it
was
a
permit
allowing
you
to
do
something
on
wetlands
which
otherwise
would
--
would
not
be
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
--
if
they
decide
that
there's
--
that
it's
not
a
wetland,
what
do
they
--
what
do
they
do?
they
do
nothing?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
wait.
surely
you
wouldn't
go
in
and
--
and
try
to
fight
arbitrary
or
capricious.
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
"otherwise
in
violation
of
the
law.
"
wouldn't
you
go
in
and
say,
that
this
is
in
violation
of
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that
one
standard
of
review
would
do
you
very
much
good,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
they've
thought
about
this.
maybe
they
got
it
wrong,
but
to
say
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious,
you
are
going
to
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
wouldn't
be
a
problem
if
--
if
this
procedure
were
not
employed.
if
there
were
not
this
--
this
prior
compliance
order
that
issues
before
actual
suit
by
the
--
by
--
by
epa
to
hold
you
liable
for
violating
the
act,
then
you'd
just
have
one
--
one
suit,
and
the
--
the
issue
would
be
clear
as
to
what
burden
the
agency
has
to
sustain.
but
it's
--
it's
really
the
dual
nature
of
this
process
that
creates
the
difficulty,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
in
the
statute.
the
agency
didn't
make
that
up,
right?
the
statute
provides
for
compliance
orders
and
it
calls
them
"compliance
orders",
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
know,
you
are
not
going
to
be
out
of
the
woods.
even
if
you
get
this
apa
review,
okay,
some
of
the
factual
questions
that
go
to
whether
these
are
wetlands
or
not
are
going
to
be
decided
giving
substantial
deference
to
the
agency's
determination
of
the
facts,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
even
if
you
lose
on
that,
you
might
still
think
you
can
win
when
the
epa
finally
brings
a
--
a
civil
action
seeking
to
impose
a
penalty,
where
the
burden
will
be
on
the
epa
without
--
without
any
deference
to
its
fact-finding.
so,
you
still
won't
know
where
you
are,
will
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
have
lost
one
but
you
may
win
the
other.
you
will
have
to
roll
the
dice.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
order
could
have
read,
it
could
have
read:
"notice
is
hereby
given
that
violation
of
or
failure
to
comply
with
the
foregoing
order.
"
--cap
"o"
--
"may
subject
respondents
to:
one,
civil
penalties
of
up
to
32.5.
"
--now
37.5
per
day.
that's
how
it
reads.
it
could
have
read:
"violation
of
or
failure
to
comply
with
the
environmental
protection
act
may
subject
respondents
to
civil
penalties.
"
it's
quite
specific
that
it
is
violation
of
--
failure
to
comply
with
the
foregoing
order,
which
includes
not
letting
--
filling
in
immediately
and
so
forth.
it
says
what
it
says.
it's
the
violation
of
the
order
that
--
that
the
additional
penalties
are
attached
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
--
it
could
as
a
theoretical
matter
double
the
penalties.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
just
saying
as
a
practical
matter
it
doesn't
often
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
going
to
bet
my
house
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
those
provisions
of
the
original
order?
i
must
say
i
was
not
edified
by
the
fact
that
when
litigation
was
threatened
or
actually
brought
the
epa
modified
its
order:
oh,
you
don't
have
to
plant
the
trees.
does
it
do
this
as
a
matter
of
practice,
issue
compliance
orders
that
go
well
beyond
what
the
epa
would
--
would
demand?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
very
nice.
[laughter]
that's
very
nice,
when
you
have
received
something
called
a
compliance
order,
which
says
you
are
subject
to
penalties
of
32.5
for
every
day
of
violations.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
shows
the
high-handedness
of
the
agency,
it
seems
to
me,
putting
in
there
stuff
that
is
simply
not
required
by
the
epa.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
corps
of
engineers
agrees
that
it
is
not
a
wetland
and
its
basis
for
refusing
to
issue
the
permit
is:
we
don't
give
a
permit;
you
don't
need
a
permit.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
binding
on
the
environmental
protection
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
--
can
the
epa
issue
a
warning
instead
of
using
this
order
procedure?
compliance
order
procedure?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
can
just
dispense
with
this
compliance
order
and
tell
the
sacketts:
in
our
view,
this
is
a
warning;
we
believe
you
are
in
violation
of
the
act;
and
you
will
be
subject
to
--
you
are
subject
to
penalties
of
37.5
per
day
for
that
violation;
and
to
remedy
the
violation,
in
our
judgment,
you
have
to
fill
in
and
you
have
to
plant,
you
know,
pine
trees
on
the
lot.
it
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
would
be
no
review
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
usually
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
if
prosecution
is
threatened
and
you
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
it,
and
you
can't
--
you
are
not
--
you're
not
compelled
to
just
stand
there
and
wait
for
the
prosecutor
to,
to
drop
the
hammer?
can't
you
normally
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
saying
there
is
no
basis
for
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
those
--
maybe
with
an
informal
warning,
but
when
you
have
something
as
formal
as
this
which
shows
that
the
agency
does
intend
to
prosecute,
why
wouldn't
you
be
able
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
maybe
the
agency
is
only
entitled
to
deference
when
in
fact
it
has
made
a
record.
when
it
hasn't
made
a
record,
maybe
there's
no
reason
to
give
it
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
--
they'll
just
issue
warnings
is
what
they'll
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
tired
already.
[laughter]
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
clean
water
act
prohibits
“the
discharge
of
any
pollutant
by
any
person”
into
navigable
waters,
which
the
act
defines
as
“the
waters
--
the
waters
of
the
united
states”.
if
the
environmental
protection
agency
determines
that
a
violation
has
occurred,
it
may
then
either
issue
a
compliance
order
or
initiate
a
civil
enforcement
action.
if
the
agency
initiates
a
civil
enforcement
action
and
wins,
the
resulting
civil
penalty
may
not
exceed
$37,500
per
day
for
each
violation.
but
at
least
as
the
government
tells
it,
that
amount
doubles
to
$75,000
per
day
when
the
epa
initiates
and
wins
a
civil
enforcement
action
after
a
person
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
compliance
order.
michael
and
chantell
sackett,
the
petitioners
here,
own
a
two
thirds
acre
residential
lot
in
bonner
county,
idaho.
the
property
lies
just
north
of
priest
lake
but
is
separated
from
the
lake
by
several
lots
with
permanent
structures
on
them.
in
preparation
for
building
a
house,
the
sacketts
filled
in
part
of
their
lot
with
rock
and
dirt.
some
months
later,
they
received
a
compliance
order
from
the
epa
which
stated
that
their
residential
lot
contained
navigable
waters
and
that
their
construction
project
violated
the
act.
the
compliance
order
directed
them
not
only
to
stop
filling
the
lot,
but
also
to
restore
the
lot
to
its
pre-construction
condition.
and
the
agency
said,
“for
everyday
the
sacketts
failed
to
comply,
they
expose
themselves
to
an
additional
$75,000
in
potential
liability.”
the
sacketts,
who
did
not
believe
that
their
land
contained
navigable
waters
having
--
never
seen
a
ship
or
other
vessel
cross
their
yard,
[laughter]
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
in
the
federal
district
court.
they
argue
that
the
compliance
order
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
that
it
deprived
them
of
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
district
court
dismissed
the
claims
for
want
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
clean
water
act
precluded
pre-enforcement
judicial
review
of
compliance
orders
and
that
such
preclusion
did
not
violate
due
process.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
sacketts
may
bring
a
civil
action
under
the
apa
to
challenge
the
issuance
of
the
epa’s
order.
the
apa
provides
for
judicial
review
of
final
agency
action
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
court.
first,
the
compliance
order
here
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
finality.
through
it,
the
apa
determined
rights
or
obligations,
requiring
the
sacketts
to
restore
their
property
according
to
an
agency
approved
plan
and
to
give
the
epa
access
to
the
property.
legal
consequence
is
also
a
flow
from
the
order,
which
according
to
the
government’s
litigating
position,
exposes
the
sacketts
to
double
penalties
in
future
enforcement
proceedings
and
the
order
severely
limits
their
ability
to
obtain
a
permit
--
a
permit
for
their
fill
from
the
army
corps
of
engineers
if,
indeed,
they
are
filling
waters
of
the
united
states.
further,
the
--
the
order’s
issuance
marks
the
consummation
of
the
agency’s
decision
making
process,
since
the
epa’s
findings
that
the
sackett's
land
was
subject
to
the
clean
water
act
were
not
subject
to
further
agency
review.
second,
the
sacketts
had,
as
review
requires,
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court.
a
civil
action
brought
by
the
epa
ordinarily
provides
judicial
review
in
such
cases,
but
the
sacketts
cannot
initiate
that
civil
action
process
and
each
day,
they
wait
for
the
epa
to
drop
the
hammer,
they
accrue
additional
potential
liability.
the
sacketts
also
may
not
obtain
an
adequate
remedy
by
applying
to
a
separate
agency,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
for
a
permit
and
then
filing
suit
under
the
apa
if
that
permit
is
--
is
denied.
they
--
they
would
claim
then
that
their
land
is
not
subject
to
permitting.
since
the
agency’s
decision
was
final
and
since
the
sacketts
have
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court,
they
may
bring
their
suit
under
the
apa.
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion,
the
clean
water
act
is
not
a
statute
that
precludes
judicial
review
under
the
apa.
the
apa
creates
a
presumption
favoring
judicial
review
of
administrative
action
as
we
have
said
in
many
prior
cases.
while
this
presumption
“may
be
overcome
by
inferences
of
intent
drawn
from
the
statutory
scheme
as
a
whole”
the
government’s
arguments
do
not
support
an
inference
that
the
clean
water
act’s
statutory
scheme
precludes
apa
review
as
it
explained
in
further
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
for
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
alito
have
filed
separate
concurring
opinions.
