who
would
review
that
and
where?
going
back
to
justice
kagan's
question
of
--
let's
assume
you
went
through
an
apa
process
and
they
found
it
was
wetlands
and
that
the
compliance
terms
were
--
had
a
substantial
nexus.
what
happens
when
you
go
into
an
enforcement
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
does
anything
get
estoppel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
anything
get
estoppel?
assuming
it's
not
a
legal
question,
would
the
factual
findings
that
there
is
a
substantial
nexus
between
the
remedy
ordered
and
the
violation,
would
that
get
estoppel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
conceding
that
the
compliance
order,
assuming
there
is
a
violation,
is
all
right?
you
are
not
challenging
any
of
the
terms
of
the
compliance
order
other
than
the
finding
of
a
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but,
mr.
stewart--
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
stewart--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
but
those
situations
are
slightly
different
because
the
act
doesn't
specify
any
specific
remedies
that
apply
to
any
specific
property.
it
just
says:
you
violate
the
act
by
filling
in
wetlands.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
violate
the
act
by
not
removing
the
fill
and
not
planting
trees
and
not
doing
this
or
doing
that.
what
it
says
is:
you
violate
the
act
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
compliance
order
that
tells
you
to
do
those
things.
so
it's
a
very
theoretically
violation
that's
going
on.
one
is
in
the
affirmative
act
prohibited
by
the
statute;
that's
the
violation
of
the
statute.
and
the
other
is
the
violation
of
the
remedial
steps
that
the
compliance
order
is
the
only
thing
that
has
set
forth.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
those
are
not
in
the
statute.
they
are
permitted
by
the
statute,
but
they're
not
set
forth
as
requirements
under
the
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
act
doesn't
specifically
tell
you
to
remove
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
i
ask
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
stewart
--
i'm
sorry,
finish
your
answer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
cut-off.
you
are
saying
if
we
were
troubled
by
the
additional
penalties,
and
you
were
going
to
suggest
something.
if
we
were
troubled
by
that
aspect
of
the
order
alone
and
you
haven't
dealt
with
the
permit
issue
after
the
fact,
what
would
be
your
approach
to
the
case
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
required
to
make
a
finding
that
there's
a
violation.
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
government
is
going
to
act
willy-nilly
and
not
going
to
act
on
sufficient
evidence
in
just
--
in
sending
a
letter
that
says
"we
find
you
are
violating
the
act.
"
