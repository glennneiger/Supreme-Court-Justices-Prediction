justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
there
would
be
no
independent
liability
under
the
--
for
--
for
violation
of
the
compliance
order.
that
is,
unless
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute,
there
would
be
no
penalty
for
violations
of
the
compliance
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
kind
of
review
are
you
seeking?
i
mean,
one
thing
you
could
say
is
you
dispute
that
this
property
is
subject
to
the
act.
that
might
be
a
question
that's
reviewable.
do
you
seek
more
than
that?
do
you
seek
review
at
this
stage
of
anything
more
than
whether
the
property
is
subject
to
the
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
the
standard
be
--
be
called?
you
have
apa
review,
so
it's
just
that
--
that
the
epa
acted
reasonably
in
determining
that
you
have
wetlands?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
no
limitation
on
the
compliance
order?
just,
it
can
be
there
forever
until
the
epa
decides
to
bring
an
enforcement
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
you
earlier,
in
this
apa
review
would
there
be
any
further
question
after
the
determination
is
it
wetlands,
is
it
not.
and
you
had
said
no,
that
would
be
it.
but
you
answered
another
question
that
would
suggest
it
may
be
wetlands
but
it
shouldn't
--
there
should
be
--
you
should
be
allowed
to
build
your
home
anyway.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
asked
for
a
hearing.
didn't
they
ask
epa
for
a
hearing
on
whether
their
lands
fell
within
the
statute?
they
did
ask
for
a
hearing
and
the
epa
said
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
--
there's
one
thing
i
do
want
you
to
tell
us
is,
epa
has
three
choices.
it
can
go
to
compliance
order;
it
can
issue
an
administrative
--
trigger
an
administrative
penalty
where
there
would
be
apa
review;
or
it
can
bring
an
enforcement
action.
how
does
the
agency
decide
which
of
those
three
routes
it's
going
to
take
in
a
given
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
this
administrative
order
that,
the
administrative
order
internally
within
epa
subject
to
judicial
review?
when
does
it
use
that
as
opposed
to
compliance
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
would
it
work
if
you
say
it's
lesser
standard
under
the
apa?
but
the
question
is,
is
this
wetlands
or
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
--
as
far
as
the
epa
is
concerned,
they
are
finished
with
that
question.
this
is
not
something
that,
well,
we
might
look
at
it
again
tomorrow
based
on
new
evidence.
the
--
the
determination
that
these
are
qualifying
wetlands,
that
has
been
made?
