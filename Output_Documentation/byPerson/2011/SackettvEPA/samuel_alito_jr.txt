that
seems
very
strange
for
that,
for
a
party
to
apply
for
a
permit
on
--
on
the
ground
that
they
don't
need
a
permit
at
all.
if
you
apply
for
a
permit,
is
the
army
corps
of
engineers
going
to
decide
whether
you
--
whether
it's
wetlands?
isn't
it
presupposed
if
you're
applying
for
a
permit
that
you
need
one
because
there's
--
they
are
wetlands?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
given
--
given
the
rather
vague
nature
of
the
test
that's
been
adopted
for
determining
whether
something
is
part
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
wouldn't
you
have
a
very
difficult
time
showing
that
a
determination
that
it
was,
was
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--has
the
united
states
adopted
a
rule
or
adopted
a
policy
that
it
will
never
seek
anything
more
than
the
penalty
for
the
underlying
violation?
it
will
not
seek
an
additional
penalty
for
violation
of
a
compliance
order?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
more
than
theoretical,
then.
i
don't
really
understand
what
you
are
saying.
you
are
saying
that
we
may
ask
for
more,
but
it's
unlikely
courts
will
actually
provide
for
more.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
if
you
related
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
come
to
us
to
an
ordinary
homeowner,
don't
you
think
most
ordinary
homeowners
would
say
this
kind
of
thing
can't
happen
in
the
united
states?
you
don't
--
you
buy
property
to
build
a
house.
you
think
maybe
there
is
a
little
drainage
problem
in
part
of
your
lot,
so
you
start
to
build
the
house
and
then
you
get
an
order
from
the
epa
which
says:
you
have
filled
in
wetlands,
so
you
can't
build
your
house;
remove
the
fill,
put
in
all
kinds
of
plants;
and
now
you
have
to
let
us
on
your
premises
whenever
we
want
to.
you
have
to
turn
over
to
us
all
sorts
of
documents,
and
for
every
day
that
you
don't
do
all
this
you
are
accumulating
a
potential
fine
of
$75,000.
and
by
the
way,
there
is
no
way
you
can
go
to
court
to
challenge
our
determination
that
this
is
a
wetlands
until
such
time
as
we
choose
to
sue
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
so
what?
somebody
from
the
epa
says
we
think
that
your
backyard
is
a
wetlands,
so
don't
build.
so
what
--
what
does
the
homeowner
do,
having
bought
the
property.
well,
all
right,
i'm
just
going
to
put
it
aside
as
a
nature
preserve?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
makes
the
epa's
conduct
here
even
more
outrageous.
we
--
we
think
now
that
this
is
--
these
are
wetlands
that
--
that
qualify,
so
we're
going
to
hit
you
with
this
compliance
order,
but,
you
know,
when
we
look
into
it
more
thoroughly
in
the
future,
we
might
change
our
mind?
