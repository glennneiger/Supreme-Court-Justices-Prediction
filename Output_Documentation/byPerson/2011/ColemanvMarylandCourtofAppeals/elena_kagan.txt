well,
mr.
foreman,
i
--
i
guess
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
this
particular
statutory
provision
has
to
do
with
gender
discrimination
and
the
history
of
gender
discrimination:
whether
congress
was
aiming
to
eradicate
gender
discrimination
through
this
provision,
or
whether
it
was
trying
to
do
something
else
entirely.
justice
elena
kagan
but
women
don't
get
sick
less
often
than
men,
do
they?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you're
just
adding
something
to
both
sides
of
the
balance
and
it
doesn't
affect
the
employer's
incentive.
the
employer
still
--
the
hypothetical
discriminatory
employer
would
still
say,
well,
women
are
going
to
be
caregivers
more
often,
so
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
not
hire
that
person.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
why
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
go
to
the
problem,
but
what
does
(d)
have
to
do
with
it?
if
you
assume
that
both
men
and
women
get
sick
at
an
approximately
equal
rate
--
maybe
you
don't
assume
that
--
but
if
you
do,
it
doesn't
seem
to
factor
into
the
employer's
incentives
in
any
way.
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
are
saying
--
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand.
you
are
saying
that
the
--
that
congress
is
thinking
that
an
employer
actually
does
think
that
women
take
more
sick
leave
because
women
get
pregnant.
and
just
as
congress
was
thinking
about
the
employer
who
thought
women
are
going
to
take
more
family
leave,
you
think
congress
was
thinking
about
the
employer
who
thinks
women
are
also
going
to
take
more
sick
leave
because
of
pregnancy?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
any
evidence
that
congress
in
fact
was
thinking
about
either
of
these
two
things?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
either
of
those
two
theories?
justice
elena
kagan
i
would
go
with
justice
alito
here.
justice
elena
kagan
if
i
could
just
stop
you
there,
mr.
howard,
for
a
second.
i
took
from
mr.
foreman
something
that
i
hadn't
understood
from
his
briefs
--
maybe
because
i
just
missed
it
--
which
is
that
he's
making
a
kind
of
analogous
argument,
that,
just
as
in
the
prior
provisions
of
the
act,
employers
thought
of
women
as
caregivers
and
the
response
of
congress
was
to
provide
a
gender-neutral
leave
benefit
that
had
both
--
that
both
women
and
men
were
eligible
for.
so
here,
employers
think
of
women
as
needing
more
medical
leave
because
of
pregnancy,
and
the
response
of
congress
is
to
provide
gender-neutral
sick
leave.
so
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
mr.
howard,
i
--
i
do
think
that
the
point
about
the
package
is
that
if
you
look
at
(d)
alone,
you
abstract
it
from
everything
else,
you
have
a
good
point,
that
it
seems
to
be
related
to
economic
security,
which
is
not
a
section
5
issue;
that
it
seems
to
be
related
to
discrimination
against
sick
people,
which
would
also
put
us
in
a
different
legal
universe.
but
when
you
look
at
(d)
as
passed
at
the
same
moment
on
the
basis
of
the
same
record
as
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
with
the
overwhelming
purpose
of
congress
being
to
protect
women
from
discrimination
in
the
workplace
because
of
unfair
stereotypical
gender
--
views
about
what
women
do
as
workers,
then
(d)
assumes
a
different
kind
of
aura.
and
you
can
talk
about
a-number
of
theories
for
that,
but
i
guess
i
would
just
ask
for
your
reaction
to
that,
that
(d)
is
just
part
of
a
package
which
was
about
telling
employers,
get
rid
of
your
old
stereotypes,
don't
act
on
your
old
stereotypes,
employ
women.
