justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
foreman,
i
think
everyone
has
been
trying
to
get
you
to
focus
on
the
health
care
sickness
leave
alone,
and
in
the
--
in
the
portions
of
the
act
that
this
court
upheld,
the
congress
said
there
is
this
close
association
of
women
with
children;
we
think
it's
going
to
be
good
for
everybody
if
fathers
recognize
their
responsibility
for
elderly
parents,
sick
children,
sick
spouse.
so,
we
--
we
can
see
the
rationale
for
trying
to
change
the
stereotype,
trying
to
open
up
care-giving
for
both
sexes.
but
you
have
answered
the
question
that
women
and
men
get
sick;
there's
no
--
there's
no
disproportion.
so
how
do
you
tie
that,
just
that
part
of
the
act,
where
there
isn't
the
obvious
association
of
women
with
childbearing?
so
we
extend
the
benefit
to
men,
so
they
will
be
associated
with
child
care.
there
isn't
that
same
link
here,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
relief
did
you
ask
for?
damages
we
know
and
you
have
to
overcome
the
eleventh
amendment.
injunctive
relief
you
don't,
but
did
you
ask
for
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
must
have
asked
for
such
other
and
further
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
congress
must
have
thought
that
giving
the
woman
back
her
job
was
an
important
part.
the
whole
idea
is
she
wasn't
supposed
to
be
fired.
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
relief,
the
non-monetary
relief,
is
certainly
important.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
you
say
you're
concerned
about
a
disincentive
to
hire
women,
but
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
makes
that
unlawful,
so
if
an
employer
decides
i
don't
want
to
hire
women
of
child-bearing
age,
that
is
an
out-and-out
violation
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
relying
on
the
incentive,
the
disincentive
to
hire
women
of
child-bearing
age.
the
law
protects
the
woman
of
child-bearing
age
by
saying:
employer,
you
can't
refuse
to
hire
her,
promote
her,
and
all
the
rest
because
of
pregnancy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
asking
you
about
--
your
--
your
argument
rests
on
an
employer
acting
unlawfully,
you
see.
he
won't
hire
--
we
have
to
give
them
medical
leave
to
everyone
because
otherwise
the
employer
won't
hire
women.
and
that's
--
the
question
i'm
asking
is,
you
are
assuming
that
the
employer
will
break
the
law
by
refusing
to
hire
women
that
--
of
child-bearing
age.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
argument
to
a
large
extent
depends
--
or
you
say
congress
did
this
because
they
wanted
to
eliminate
or
at
least
reduce
one
kind
of
discrimination
against
women
in
the
job
market.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
that
discrimination
was
refusing
to
hire
women
of
child-bearing
age.
well,
they
couldn't
do
it
out
and
out
because
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law.
so
is
congress
having
in
mind
discrimination
that
is
under
--
under
the
radar
screen,
that
is
going
to
go
on
even
though
it's
unlawful?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
need
go
no
further?
i'm
sorry?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
couldn't
--
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
says
you
have
to
treat
pregnancy
like
any
other
disability.
so
if
they
are
not
giving
anybody
any
leave
for
anything,
they
don't
have
to
give
any
leave;
not
12
weeks,
not
1
day.
and
that's
what
--
that's
the
gap
that
this
legislation
fills,
essentially.
yes,
you
do
have
to
provide
leave
for
women
who
have
disabling
conditions,
including
pregnancy,
but
then
you
have
to
give
that
to
the
men
as
well.
you
can't
reserve
that
for
the
one
sex.
so
it
was
the
gap
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
that
this
--
this
was
referring
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
idea
is
it's
part
of
one
package.
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
was
getting
at.
but
just
suppose
that
congress
wanted
to
improve
conditions
for
the
--
in
the
job
market
for
women,
which
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
was
the
motivating
force
behind
this
act,
and
they
also
wanted
to
protect
families
so
that
sick
children,
sick
spouses
are
attended
to.
now,
what
leave
policy
would
say,
okay,
to
do
that
we
will
have
leave
when
a
spouse
is
sick,
a
child
is
sick,
a
parent
is
sick,
but
not
when
the
worker
herself
is
sick?
without
--
it's
all
part
of
one
package
which
is
designed
to
increase
job
security
for
women
and
increase
protection
for
their
families.
so,
i
don't
think
you
can
slice
off
(d)
from
the
other
three.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
--
that
wasn't
part
of
the
original
act,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
--
that
was
--
the
concern
was
a
discrete
concern
for
veterans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
part
of
the
package
that
was
the
family
and
medical
leave
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
some
focus
in
the
legislative
history
particularly
on
the
--
the
family
that
has
a
single
parent
--
much
more
often
a
woman,
not
a
man
--
and
the
devastating
impact
on
that
family
of
the
woman
getting
sick,
the
sole
breadwinner
getting
sick.
so
that
was
certainly
a
--
a
problem
for
families
with
--
with
only
one
breadwinner.
and
congress
was
focusing
on
those
women
and
wanting
to
have
job
security
for
them.
that
wasn't
the
only
group
of
women,
but
certainly
that
--
that
affected
this
act
as
it
came
out,
didn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
of
how
congress
would
do
it
if
they
--
if
they
provided
only
for
the
woman
who
was
the
single
head
of
the
family,
then
that
would
be
vulnerable
under
equal
protection
because
they
didn't
provide
it
for
men.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
(d)
is
a
remedy
for
the
problem.
i
think
there's
really
not
much
disagreement
about
the
problem,
that
there
is
gender
discrimination
in
the
job
market.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
the
question
is
how
do
we
remedy
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
we've
just
heard,
justices
breyer,
sotamayor,
kagan
join
me
in
dissenting
from
today's
decision.
the
entire
family
and
medial
leave
act
we
would
hold,
including
the
self-care
provision
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congress'
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
act
was
designed
to
promote
women's
opportunities
to
live
balanced
lives
at
home
having
gainful
employment.
a
particular
problem
congress
faced
was
the
disadvantageous
treatment
of
women
on
pregnancy
or
childbirth
requires
them
to
take
time
away
from
work.
the
best
way
to
protect
women
against
losing
their
jobs
because
of
pregnancy
or
childbirth,
congress
determine
was
not
to
order
leaves
for
women
only
for
that
would
deter
employers
from
hiring
them.
instead,
congress
adopted
leave
policies
from
which
all
could
benefit.
the
act
was
a
work-in-progress
for
some
seven
years.
in
that
time,
congress
received
evidence
from
individuals
and
organizations
documenting
pervasive
discrimination
against
women
based
on
pregnancy
or
the
potential
to
become
pregnant.
congress
also
found
that
pregnant
women
were
at
risk
of
losing
their
jobs
in
the
public
sector
just
as
they
were
in
the
private
sector.
maryland
as
defendant
in
this
case
noted
a
1974
decision
of
this
court,
geduldig
v.
aiello.
footnote
20
of
the
aiello
opinion
stated
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
is
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
as
such.
that
is
so,
the
court
reasoned
because
many
non-pregnant
persons
are
female.
today's
case
is
a
fit
occasion
to
revisit
and
reject
the
court's
reasoning
in
aiello.
to
say
that
a
classification
based
on
pregnancy
is
gender
neutral,
justice
stevens
later
pointed
out,
makes
no
sense.
by
definition
he
explained,
disadvantageous
treatment
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
discriminates
on
account
of
sex
for
it
is
the
capacity
to
become
pregnant
which
primarily
differentiates
the
female
from
the
male.
as
the
court
chronicled
nine
years
ago
in
nevada
department
of
human
resources
v.
hibbs,
a
woman's
childbearing
capacity
and
attended
myths
about
motherhood
and
women's
lack
of
commitment
to
work
underlie
the
historic
and
not
yet
banished
discrimination
against
women
in
gainful
employment.
i
would
hold
that
aiello
was
egregiously
wrong
in
wiping
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
as
something
other
than
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
requisite
congruence
and
proportionality,
i
would
also
hold,
exists
between
the
right
to
be
free
from
pregnancy
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
the
self-care
provision
at
issue
in
this
case.
congress,
as
i
earlier
observed,
made
claim
its
rationale
for
entitling
all
employees
to
take
leave
for
a
serious
health
condition
rather
than
singling
out
pregnancy
or
childbirth.
reluctance
to
hire
or
promote
women,
congress
comprehended,
would
attend
the
pregnancy
only
leave
requirement,
but
self-care
leave
for
all
would
ward
off
that
effect
for
men
take
sick
leave
about
as
often
as
women
do.
self-care
leave
is
a
key
part
of
congress'
endeavor
to
make
it
feasible
for
women
to
work
and
have
families.
the
fmla
as
a
whole
and
in
all
of
its
parts
advances
women's
economic
opportunities
and
supports
a
more
egalitarian
relationship
at
home
and
at
work.
the
inequality
congress
sought
to
overcome
seems
to
me
well
within
the
national
legislature's
authority
to
address.
the
court's
judgment
dilutes
the
force
of
the
act
and
that
is
regrettable,
but
at
least
the
damage
is
contained.
the
self-care
provision
remains
valid
commerce
clause
legislation
and
therefore
applies
undiluted
in
the
private
sector.
states
remain
bound
by
the
self-care
provision
to
this
extent
though
private
individuals
may
not
recover
damages
when
a
state
employer
violates
the
self-care
provision.
injunctive
relief
against
the
responsible
state
official
maybe
possible
and
the
department
of
labor
has
authority
to
sue
a
state
employer
for
violating
the
self-care
provision
and
to
gain
monetary
relief
for
adversely
affected
employees.
