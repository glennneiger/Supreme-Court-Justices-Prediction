justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
are
you
separating
the
four
things.
i
mean,
i
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
three
separate
rationales.
one,
the
easiest,
is
in
(d)
itself,
sometimes
a
woman
could
have
a
miscarriage
and
of
course
she
has
to
stay
home.
and
that
isn't
covered
by
(a),
(b),
or
(c),
so
we
cover
it
in
(d),
you
know.
and
then
we
put
the
men
in
too
because
we
don't
want
to
make
this
incentive
just
to
not
hire
women.
that's
one.
the
second
one
was
the
one
justice
ginsburg
brought
up,
that
there
is
a
gap
in
the
pregnancy
law
which
won't
work
unless
you
have
to
give
people
some
medical
leave.
so
here
it
is,
(d).
and
the
third
one,
which
i
think
was
related
to
what
justice
alito
just
said,
is
when
--
you
have
to
read
it
together
to
understand
the
third
one.
you
get
weeks
altogether,
all
right?
now,
that
means
once
you
put
in
(d)
this
act
will
have
less
of
a
bad
effect.
the
bad
effect
of
the
act
is
if
you
protect
the
women
then
the
employers
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
hire
women,
perfect.
we
have
to
give
them
12
leaves,
we'd
have
to
give
the
men
--
terrible,
it's
a
terrible
disincentive.
but
then
they
worked
out
how
to
lessen
the
disincentive.
and
the
way
you
do
that,
you
say
12
weeks
overall.
now
look
what
happens.
a
woman
wants
to
take,
say,
12
weeks
to
look
after
her
family,
and
she
gets
separately
sick,
4
more
weeks.
but
how
many
does
she
get?
answer:
12,
right?
12.
you
could
answer,
12.
now
let's
think
of
the
man.
let's
think
of
the
man.
the
man
would
like
to
look
after
the
family,
say,
for
6
weeks.
and
he
gets
sick
4
weeks.
how
many
weeks
have
we
got?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
10.
thank
you.
[laughter]
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perfect.
so
now
the
employer
is
sitting
--
and
it
will
work
with
other
numbers.
i
don't
rely
on
those.
[laughter]
but
now
look
what
happens.
without
this
act,
he's
got
a
woman
who
is
going
to
be
out
of
there
--
i
mean,
with
the
act
--
unless
we
put
in
four
--
unless
we
put
in
the
fourth
part
of
it,
we
have
a
woman
who
is
gone
for
12
weeks,
and
a
man
who
is
gone
maybe
for
6
but
maybe
for
zero,
okay?
maybe
for
6.
with
the
act,
the
woman
is
gone
for
12,
the
man
is
gone
for
10.
you
see?
and
so
the
comparison
there
--
and
it
will
work
with
whatever
numbers
you
want
--
the
comparison
there
is
very
different.
and
the
comparison
doesn't,
doesn't
totally
erase
the
problem
with
the
woman,
but
it
may
reduce
it
to
a
size
where
the
act
itself
will
no
longer
act
as
such
a
disincentive
to
hiring
a
woman.
now,
we
have
three
different
rationales.
all
of
them
are
related
to
a
serious
problem,
which
is
the
problem
of
discrimination
against
women
because
the
employers
think
they
will
be
home
more,
and
so
you
see
the
conclusion
i
am
drawing?
yeah,
okay.
so
where
are
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't
have
to,
of
course.
but
the
whole
point
of
the
question
that
i
was
asking
was,
sure,
what
helps
you
by
doing
it
separately
is
it
helps
your
case.
but
if
we
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
they
were
trying
to
do
it
as
a
whole.
that's
my
point
that-i
want
you
to
answer.
and
they
are
trying
to
do
it
as
a
whole
because,
no
matter
what
numbers
i
use,
if
i
look
at
it
without
(d)
--
is
it
(d)?
yeah,
(d).
if
i
look
at
it
without
(d),
the
ratio
will
disfavor
the
woman.
and
if
i
look
at
it
with
(d),
suddenly
the
ratio
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employer
of
the
disadvantage
of
hiring
a
woman
over
--
over
hiring
a
man,
it
goes
way
down.
and
that
helps
women.
and
that
is
why
i
think,
reading
this
and
listening,
a
major
reason
why
they
put
in
(d)
as
part
of
the
other,
because
working
with
that
12-week
limitation,
and
the
whole
rest
of
the
statute,
we
now
have
a
statute
that
doesn't
defeat
itself.
we
now
have
a
statute
that
actually
can
achieve
the
end
of
leading
employers
to
not
discriminate
against
women.
not
perfectly,
but
there's
a
big
improvement.
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
argument
i'm
making.
you
have
to
read
it
as
a
whole
to
see
that.
and
that's
what
i
--
i
wonder
if
there's
an
answer
to
that.
of
course,
i'm
at
the
moment
thinking
there
isn't
an
answer
to
it,
but
i
ask
the
question
because
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
absolutely
right.
and
that's
why
this
health
spa
thing,
(d),
this
is
--
in
fact
has
two
independent
reasons
that
all
--
the
miscarriage
reason
and
the
pregnancy
act
reason,
and
so
it
isn't
just
saying
go
to
a
health
spa.
but
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
put
arguments
in
your
mouth,
which
i
just
have,
which
you
wouldn't
like
there
anyway,
because
--
but
i
would
appreciate
your
going
on
with
this
discussion
in
respect
to
what
justice
alito
and
i
have
been
talking
about,
and
i
would
be
interested
in
what
you
say.
