justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
i
--
i
take
your
argument,
but
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
record,
the
reports,
the
findings,
et
cetera,
and
the
statements
repeatedly
by
many
congresspeople,
there
appears
to
be
--
have
been
a
dual
motive
for
this
provision.
they
were
in
fact
engaged
in
the
question
of
discrimination
against
pregnant
women.
that
was
recognized
in
hibbs,
and
that's
clear.
but
with
respect
to
this
particular
provision,
they
were
also
concerned
about
economic
effect
that
--
that
happened
to
everyone,
men
and
women,
who
became
disabled.
and
so
they
appear
to
have
had
dual
motivation.
part
of
the
bill
was
gender-related,
part
of
the
bill
seemed
to
be
disability-related.
what
do
--
how
do
we
judge
that
kind
of
bill,
where
congress
may
have
been
expanding
the
benefits
it's
giving
to
people,
not
solely
because
of
gender
discrimination,
but
because
of
this
desire
to
address
disability
discrimination?
justice
sonia

can
i
--
i'm
sorry.
justice

but,
there
certainly
was
--
there
was
certainly
much
conversation
and
testimony
that,
whether
they
in
fact
took
the
same
amount
of
leave
time
or
not,
that
women
who
were
pregnant
or
were
perceived
as
capable
of
getting
pregnant
were
hired
less
frequently
because
subjectively
the
employers
thought
that
they
were
more
likely
to
take
the
time.
so,
frankly,
for
years
there
was
questions
about
whether
law
firms
were
hiring
young
--
not
hiring
young
women
because
they
feared
they
would
leave
in
the
middle
of
a
big
case
or
something
else.
we
all
know
those
stories,
so
it
is
sort
of
common
knowledge
in
many
ways,
but
there
was
plenty
of
testimony
related
to
that.
so
assume
that
that
was
congress's
perception,
because
it
was
supported
by
the
record
or
as
much
of
the
record
as
hibbs
recognized
as
adequate.
where
does
that
leave
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
justice
alito
was
trying
to
help
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
working
from
a
different
proposition
than
you
are
in
response
to
this
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
actual
amount
of
time
that
men
and
women
take
is
relevant.
the
question
is:
what
is
the
employer's
perception,
and
did
congress
have
a
valid
basis,
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out
earlier,
to
believe
that
employers
thought
women
took
more
time.
