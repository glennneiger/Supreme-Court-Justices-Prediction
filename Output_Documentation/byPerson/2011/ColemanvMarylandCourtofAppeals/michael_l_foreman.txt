mr.
michael
l.
foreman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
propriety
of
any
section
5
legislation
is
judged
by
in
reference
to
the
historical
perspective
that
it
reflects,
and
that
historical
perspective
is
very
clear
in
--
and
it's
set
very
clearly
by
congress
and
by
this
court.
it
--
it
is
an
unfortunate,
long
history
of
state-sponsored
gender
discrimination.
and
that
discrimination
embodies
gender-based
stereotypes
that
took
a
very
firm
hold
in
the
employment
area,
where
women
had
difficulty
obtaining
employment
and
holding
employment.
and
this
court
in
a
litany
of
cases
recognized
these
gender-based
stereotypes
as
an
improper
assumption
about
women's
abilities.
in
frontiero
v.
richardson,
it
rejected
this
issue
that
women's
mission
were
to
be
women
--
to
be
wives
and
mothers;
stanton
v.
stanton,
that
women
were
to
be
the
homemaker
and
men
the
breadwinner,
and--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--and
--
and
it
was
directly
attempting
to
address
these
gender-based
stereotypes
in
a
couple
different
ways
as
a
practical
matter.
at
that
time,
when
an
employer
saw
a
woman,
they
didn't
necessarily
just
see
a
worker.
they-saw
a
person
that
could
become
pregnant,
and
worked
on
these
gender-based
stereotypes,
that
that
woman
would
either
become
pregnant,
would
be
disabled
because
of
pregnancy-related
disabilities,
but
in
any
event
was
a
least
--
least
attractive
employee.
and
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
addresses
that
specifically
in
its
purposes
section.
it
specifically
says
that
it
is
intended
"to
promote
the
equal
opportunity
for
women
and
men
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
"
but
more
specific
to
the
self-care
provision,
congress
made
it
very
clear
what
they
were
trying
--
attempting
to
do.
if
you
move
to
the
6,
they
address--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--i
am
reading
from
appendix
a
to
the
brief,
and
it
is
--
that
"employment
standards
that
apply
to
one
gender
only
have
a
serious
potential
for
encouraging
employers
to
discriminate
against
employees
and
applicants
of
employment
who
are
of
that
gender.
"
that's
the
negative
inference
argument
that
we
make
in
our
brief.
but
even
more
to
the
point,
if
you
move
to
the
purpose
sections
at
appendix
2,
page
--
appendix
2,
it
specifically
is
intended
to
minimize
the
potential
for
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
by
ensuring
generally
that
leave
is
available
for
eligible
medical
reasons,
including
maternity-related
disabilities,
and
for
compelling
family
reasons,
and
ensure
equal
protection
under
the
law--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--the
rationale
of
congress
at
that
point
was
that
they
could
address
this
issue
several
different
ways;
they
--
and
they
passed
(a),
(b),
and
(c):
the
birth
of
the
child,
the
adoption
of
the
child,
and
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
against
--
again,
addressing
gender-based
stereotypes.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
but
one
of
the
things
congress
tried
to
do
is
to
take
that
incentive
away.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
it
affects
the
incentive
by
providing
--
it
becomes
the
equal
opportunity
employer.
it
evens
the
ground.
and
the
way
it
would
do
it
is
an
employer
if
you
just
have
(a)
through
(c)
can
look
at
an
employee
and,
based
upon
gender
stereotypes,
would
make
the
assumption
that
the
women,
because
of
historically
the
role
they
were
required
to
play,
would
be
taking
all
the
leave
under
(a)
and
(b)
and
(c).
and
so
why
would
i
even
hire
that
woman
in
the
first
place?
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
no,
absolutely.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
but
under
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
after
the
family
and
medical
leave,
an
employer
would
look
and
say
both
men
can
take
leave
now.
and
i
think
we
need
to
step
back--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
demonstrates
that
there's
a
differential
rate
between
the
self-care
rate
for
men
and
women.
but
the
perception
was
that
women,
because
of
pregnancy,
because
of
pregnancy-related
disabilities,
would
in
fact
take
more
leave.
and
so
that
i
would
look
at
a
woman
as
an
employer
and
say:
she
will
become
pregnant,
she
will
take
leave,
she
will
be
disabled.
however,
with
(d)
now,
but
the
man
can
take
a
disability
leave
on
the
same
basis.
and
the
hope
of
congress
was
not
that
it
would
happen
immediately,
but
by
the
--
what
would
happen
is
with
the
application
of
family
and
medical
leave
at
some
point
men
would
be
taking
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
and
in
fact,
women
and
men
would
be
taking
family
and
medical
self-care
leave--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--i
think
it
is
the
same
linkage
trying
to
address
--
it's
addressing
a
difference
there,
but
it's
addressing
the
linkage
that
women
will
in
fact
take
pregnancy-based
leave
or
pregnancy-based
disabilities
and
therefore
are
less
attractive,
less
--
employed;
and
that
is
what
self-care
was
intended
to
do.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question
--
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
a
confusing
response.
there
are
two
separate
ways
of
addressing
that.
you
can
look
at
self-care
as
a
stand-alone
provision,
without
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
congress
passed
just
self-care.
in
that
case
it
would
be
responding
to
exactly
that
type
of
gender
stereotype,
and
12
weeks
would
be
a
congruent
proportional
response.
the
other
way
to
look
at
it
is
that's
not
the
way
congress
passed
the
bill.
they
passed
it
as
a
comprehensive
response
with
(a),
(b)
and
(c),
and
hence
(d)
then
becomes
a
bit
of
an
equalizer
to
take
away
this
negative
incentive
that
only
women
would
take
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
so
there's
two
separate
ways
that
this
court
can
get
to
the
same
conclusion,
and
that
conclusion
is
that
this
is
a
congruent
and
proportional
response
to
gender-based
discrimination.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
yes,
there
--
there
is,
your
honor.
and
let
me
--
let
me
take
the
negative
inference
first,
because
i
think
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
comprehensive
makes
sense
--
is
it
was
introduced
--
and
i
am
reading
from
page
43.
it's
referenced
on
page
43
of
our
brief
that,
starting
in
1987,
national
women's
political
caucus
testified,
quote:
"my
primary
purpose
is
to
stress
that
parental
and
medical
leave
are
inseparable.
"
"in
the
words
of
the
old
song,
'you
can't
have
one
without
the
other.
"
and
the
point
she
then
later
on
to
explain
was
parental
leave
without
medical
leave
would
encourage
discrimination
against
women
of
child-bearing
age,
who
constitute
approximately
73
percent
of
all
women
in
the
workforce.
employers
would
tend
to
hire
men,
who
are
much
less
likely
to
make
this
claim.
fast
forward
to
1993
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
--
and
this
would
be
on
page
42
of
our
merits
brief:
"a
law
providing
special
protection
to
women
or
any
defined
group,
in
addition
to
being
inequitable,
runs
the
risk
of
causing
discrimination.
"
the
fml
addresses
this
by
addressing
the
needs
of
all
workers,
avoids
this
risk.
the
fmla
is
based
on
the
guarantees
of
equal
protection.
so
it
addresses
that
aspect
of
--
it
addresses
that
aspect.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
justice
sotomayor,
i
--
i
think
the
way
you
judge
it
is
rely
on
what
congress's
expressed
findings
and
provisions
are.
and
to
the
extent
this
court
makes
a
determination
that
the
fmla
is
responsive
to
gender-based
discrimination,
then
how
congress
chose
to
address
that
is
congruent
and
proportional.
the
fact
that
congress
may
also
have
had
other
motives,
that
there
was
a
concern
with
--
with
families,
and
that
families
would
benefit,
should
not
be
used
to
undermine
the
fact
that
congress
indeed
was
acting
pursuant
to
one
of
its
broadest
powers,
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
therefore
that
their
--
their
considered
judgment
is
a
congruent
and
proportional
response.
part
of
--
part
of
the
findings
is
clearly
reflective
of
the
fact
that
this
covered
both
governmental
employers
and
private
industry,
so
there
was
reference
to
commerce
clause
type
of
--
of
analysis
which
my
colleagues
raised
repeatedly
in
their
brief.
but
the
court
--
the
congress
needed
to
do
that
because
they
were
regulating
private
employment,
but
at
the
same
time
recognized
the
extent
that
we
are
--
are
going
to
regulate
state-based
conduct.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
justice
alito,
i
think
what
you're
--
you'll
clearly
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
i
think
what
you
are
responding
to,
is
there
an
ex
parte
young
action
here
that
would
be
able
to
be
made
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
under
the
commerce
clause?
and
the
answer
is
--
and
i
know
that
both
justice
kennedy
and
justice
rehnquist,
i
think,
in
one
of
his
dissents,
pointed
out
in
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
that
the
employee
may
not
be
left
out
in
the
dark,
because
there
is
an
ex
parte
young
claim.
a
couple
points
on
that--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
we
are
not
contesting
it
consistent
with
any
ex
parte
young
claim.
what
the
district
court
did
was,
the
claim
is
totally
dismissed
based
on
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
but
if
i
could
try
to
respond
to
your
question
more
specifically,
this
court
has
never
as
a
court
hold
that
ex
parte
young
type
of
action
is
available
in
this
type
of
claim.
assuming
that
it--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--pardon?
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
correct.
but
as
--
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent
in
hibbs,
that
ex
parte
young
may
be
available,
but
one
of
the
concerns
we
have
is
again
that
the
court
--
the
majority
court
has
never
held
that.
i
believe
that
is
in
fact
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
law,
that
it
would
be
available
for
injunctive
relief.
however,
the
court
has
never
defined
the
parameters
of
what
an
ex
parte
young
action
really
gives
a
plaintiff,
and
that
becomes
very
important--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--i
think
you
would
have
to
make
that
accommodation,
but,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
an
incorrect
approach.
and
here's
the
reason
why
in
ex
parte
young,
a
perfect
example--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--and
apparently
i
missed
that
and
i
apologize.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
in
the
complaint
itself,
it
does
not
ask
for
injunctive
relief
pursuant
to
the
family
and
medical
leave
act.
there
were
combined
claims--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--if
that
is
your
reading
of
it,
we
will
certainly
accept
your
reading.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
but
again
back
to
the
ex
parte
young,
in
the
case
nelson
v.
the
university
of
tennessee
--
texas,
the
case
that
dealt
exactly
with
this
issue
of
abrogation
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
they
found
that
there
was
valid
abrogation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
the
state
of
texas
--
then
the
court
was
required
to
address
the
ex
parte
young
issue.
and
the
state
of
texas
argued
that
reinstatement
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy
under
ex
parte
young
and
that,
while
the
fifth
circuit
ultimately
rejected
that,
that
is
an
argument
that
employees
would
have
to
face,
what
are
the
parameters
of
ex
parte
young.
and
more
importantly,
that
is
not
the
remedy
that
congress
in
their
considered
judgment
believed
was
the
appropriate
remedy
to
address
gender-based
discrimination.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
it
is
extremely
important,
but
congress
did
not
stop
there.
congress
decided
it
needed
to
take
one
step
further
and
there
needed
to
be
monetary
relief.
and
i
think
mr.
coleman's
case
illustrates
exactly
why.
here
mr.
coleman
exercised
his
rights
that
were
supposedly
guaranteeing
him
under
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
and
indeed
under
a
state
law,
and
the
state
of
maryland
fired
him
and
he
is
out
of
work.
and
what
is
the
disincentive
for
the
state
to
not
do
the
same
thing
the
next
time
if
the
only
thing
that
you
can
get
is
possibly
injunctive
relief
prohibiting
him
from
doing
that
in
the
future
and
maybe
reinstatement
2
or
3
years
down
the
line?
employees
at
that
point
cannot
put
their
lives
on
hold.
they
have
a
duty
to
go
out
and
try
to
mitigate,
try
to
find
another
job.
what
is
an
employer
to
do?
and
congress
said
there
needs
to
be
more.
we
passed
title
vii
to
try
to
address
gender-based
discrimination,
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
but
there
were
still
voids.
and
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
attempts
to
fill
those
voids
and
one
of
those
voids
is
try
to
provide
a
monetary
incentive
so
that
the
state
of
maryland
and
private
employers
will
in
fact
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
that
is,
your
honor,
but
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
did
not
fill
the
other
gap
which
the
family
and
medical--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--what
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
provided
was
that
you
needed
to
treat
pregnancy-related
disabilities
as
you
would
other
short-term
disabilities.
so
if
an
employer
decided
not
to
provide--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--i
don't
want
to
make
that
assumption
in
my
incentive
argument.
i
was
using
mr.
coleman
as
an
example
of
why
congress
could
have
made
a
determination
that
monetary
relief
would
be
appropriate
in
the
family
and
medical
leave
act.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
i
--
i
don't
think
that
was
congress's
intent.
that
is
not
what
was
reflected.
i
think,
again,
they
were
trying
to
address
it
on
two
separate
levels:
one,
the
gender-based
discrimination,
the
gender
stereotype
that
women
simply
become
less
attractive;
and
in
the
broader
statute
to
prevent
the
negative
inference
so
that
all
--
that
ultimately
where
we
would
get
in
society
is
the
ability
to
take
pregnancy-related
leave,
other
leave,
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
negative
inference
running
against
women,
and
therefore
women
ultimately
would-become
a
nonissue.
and
i
see
the
light's
on,
so
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
this
is
not
responsive
to
disability-based
discrimination.
the
findings
and
the
purpose
of
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
make
it
clear
that
it
is
responsive
to
gender-based
discrimination.
hibbs
in
fact
found
that
the
fmla
was
in
response
to
gender-based
discrimination.
in
making
that
finding,
they
did
not
differentiate
between
the
different
leave
provisions.
and
indeed,
if
you
move
to
tennessee
v.
lane,
where
justice
rehnquist
dissented,
drawing
distinctions
between
disability-based
discrimination
and
sex-based
discrimination,
stated
that
the
task
of
identifying
the
constitutional
right
at
issue
in
the
family
and
medical
leave
act
was
"an
easy
one".
and
that
was
his
word,
"easy".
it's
responsive
to
gender-based
discrimination.
chief
justice
roberts,
i
think
your
question
about
the
military
leave
portion
of
the
fmla
illustrates
that
congress
--
what
congress
was
doing
here
when
they
added
that
almost
10
years
later,
they
just
--
did
not
simply
try
to
pigeonhole
it
into
--
this
is
section
5
legislation.
in
the
circuits
at
that
time,
there
was
considerable
debate
as
to
whether
that
could
be
justified
as
proper
abrogation
of
immunity--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
yes,
it
should,
because
it
was
passed
pursuant
to
a
different
constitutional
power,
and
they
provided
in
fact
a
different
remedy,
recognizing
that
the
commerce
clause
could
not
--
that
commerce
clause
was
the
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
this.
and
they
provided
a
right
of
action
by
the
united
states
in
order
to
provide
damages.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
as
to--
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
--well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
--
they
provide
that
the
state
is
an
employer
for
purposes
of
coverage
of
the
family
and
medical
leave
act.
and
if
you
go
to
29
u.s.c.
2005,
where
it
says
a
public
entity
is
covered
by
the
family
and
medical
leave
act,
then
--
that
damages
are
available.
it
specifically
includes
state.
in
terms
of
my
colleague's
attempt
to
distance
this
case
from
hibbs,
in
all
due
respect,
we
think
that
hibbs
did
the
heavy
lifting
here.
it
is
the
same
legislative
purpose.
it
is
the
same
constitutional
right.
it
is
the
same
statutory
scheme.
mr.
michael
l.
foreman
but
you
do,
your
honor.
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
discussions
we
had
earlier,
that
it's
response
to
gender-based
discrimination:
stereotypes
of
pregnant
women
will
take
leave.
and
so
we
think
they
would
stand
alone.
but
as
the
discussion
today
indicated,
we
think
the
appropriate
way
is
to
treat
this
as
a
comprehensive
whole
response
to
gender-based
discrimination,
and
do
as
you
did
in
hibbs,
find
that
it
is
a
congruent
proportional
response
to
gender-based
discrimination.
thank
you.
