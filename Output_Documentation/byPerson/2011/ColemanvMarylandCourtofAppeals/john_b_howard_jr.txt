mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
order
to
affirm
in
this
case,
the
court
need
go
no
further
than
to
distinguish
hibbs,
and
we
think
hibbs
is
readily
distinguishable.
and
i
would
like
to
highlight
four
principal--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
need
go
no
further
than
simply
to
distinguish
hibbs.
and
we
think
there
are
at
least
four
distinctions
that
we'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
highlight
today.
the
first
is
one
that,
justice
kagan,
your
question
goes
to,
which
is
subsections
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
are
all
related
in
some
fashion
to
women's
roles
with
respect
to
work
and
family.
subsection
(d)
really
does
not
speak
to
that
purpose.
and
i
think
my
second
sort
of
distinction
i
would
point
to--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--congress,
justice
kagan,
did
not
i
think
take
that
stereotype
or
perception
that
mr.
foreman
referred
to
into
account.
and
i'd
specifically
point
the
court
to
page
21
of
our
brief,
where
we
cite
some
bureau
of
labor
statistics
studies
indicating
that
men
and
women
at
the
time
took
roughly
the
same
amount
of
sick
leave.
in
fact,
mr.
foreman
has
conceded
as
much.
and
that
same
study
projects
that
men
and
women
will
take
roughly
the
same
amount
of
time
after
the
enactment
of
the
fmla--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--well,
i
would
make
a
couple
of
points
in
response
to
that,
justice
sotomayor.
first,
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
already
in
place,
and
so
to
the
extent
there
were
perceptions
that
employers
might
discriminate
based
on
pregnancy
disabilities,
that
would
be
unlawful
under
title
vii
as
amended
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
and
the
fact
that
--
and
you
are
quite
right
that
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
discussion
in
the
legislative
record,
although
i
think
it's
less
of
a
predominant
theme
than
the
concern
for
job
security
for
working
families,
but
there
certainly
is
discussion
about
pregnancy
discrimination
and
pregnancy
disability
as
a
type
of
illness.
but,
we
again
would
note
that
this
is
valid
commerce
clause
legislation,
and
so
to
the
extent
that
kind
of
discrimination
was
occurring,
and
leave
was
being
denied
or
women
were
suffering
adverse
consequences
in
the
workplace
as
a
result
of
pregnancy
discrimination,
they
could
enforce
the
12
weeks
through
a
title
<vii>
[=
vii]
action.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
yes,
i
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
gap
that
existed
was
the
absence
of
a
guaranteed
period
of
leave.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
absence
of
the
substantive
entitlement
to
a
certain
amount
of
leave.
and
in
effect
the
gap
that
was
being
filled
served
as
prophylaxis
for
title
vii,
but
not
for
constitutional
violations.
now--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--justice
alito,
i
think
that
one
could
argue
that
that
is
connected
with
eliminating
pregnancy
disability
discrimination.
it's
also
connected
to
the
purposes
of
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
i
think
that
the
principal
reason
why
employers
do
view
potential
hires
as
--
when
they
are
women,
as
likely
to
take
a
lot
of
time
off,
i
think
goes
more
to
the
family
caretaking
provisions,
and
i
think
that
is
largely
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
yes,
justice
alito,
and
i
think
what--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--that
would
certainly
be
part
of
the
answer,
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
what
you
are
describing
is
a
disproportionate
impact
on
women
as
a
result
of
assumptions
concerning
pregnancy
disability.
and
of
course,
if
states
were
engaging
in
this
kind
of
conduct
or
if
there
were
a
disproportionate
impact,
that
would
not
state
an
equal
protection
violation
under
washington--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--10.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i
like
these
questions.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
well,
let
me
speak
first
to
the
second
one,
the
concern
about
the
gap.
the
gap
that
is
filled
by
the
12
weeks
is,
is
a
--
is
to
provide
a
substantive
entitlement.
and
when
it
permits
a
claim,
a
damages
claim
enforceable
against
the
state
treasury,
it
provides
an
entirely
--
it
requires
a
different
justification
than
simply
to
fill
a
gap
with
the
substantive
entitlement.
if
the--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
you
can
separate
(d),
on
the
same
analysis
that
this
court
applied
in
tennessee
v.
lane,
in
contrast
to
the
garrett
case.
in
lane,
of
course,
different
sections
of
the
same
antidiscrimination
act
required
different
analysis,
analyses
and
reference
to
different
parts
of
the
record.
there
was
a
single
over-arching
purpose,
to
prevent
discrimination
against
persons
with
disabilities,
but
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
particular
claim
requires
a
different
analysis.
as
justice
stevens
said,
the
court's
not
required
to
evaluate
statutes
as
an
undifferentiated
whole.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
the
ratio,
i
think
the
premise
of
that
point
is
that
women
will
take
more
leave
for
serious
health
conditions
than
men.
and
i
don't
think
that's
borne
out.
and,
you
know,
mr.
foreman
has
recognized
as
much.
so
i
don't
think
the
ratio
really
changes.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i
think
even
if
one
accepted
the
premise,
and
we
don't,
that
women
take
more
leave
for
health
conditions,
that
would
further
dilute
the
ratio,
to
have
available
all
those
types
of
leave.
now,
i
thought,
for
example,
one
could
imagine--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--he
was.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i,
i
think
that
if
--
even
if
that
were
correct,
and,
and
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
i
think
the
overwhelming
themes
in
the
legislative
record
as
a
whole
really
were
a
concern
for
working
families,
whether
single-income,
double-income,
and
the
concern
that
if
a
breadwinner
falls
ill
the
family's
going
to
have
severe
financial
insecurity.
and
then
there
was
also
concern
against
discrimination
against
persons
with
illness.
but
i
think
that
one
thing
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
your
suggestion,
justice
sotomayor,
and
really
almost
all
of
the
discussion
here
today,
i
think
explains
why
this
is
good
social
policy;
we
support
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
really
gotten
anywhere
near
the
necessary
predicate
of
unconstitutional
state
conduct
when
the
constitutional
right
is
defined
with
some
precision.
and
i
think
one
has
to
define
this
right
as,
as
disability.
and
i
think
also
the
protections
that
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
already
had
in
place,
when
added
with
the
substantive
--
to
the
substantive
entitlement
as
a
matter
of
commerce
clause
legislation,
to
this
leave--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--well,
that's
a
good
question,
and
i
think
we
are
here
mainly
on,
we
need
to
defend
this
on
principle.
as,
justice
kennedy,
you've
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
your
opinions,
the
exercise
of
the
section
5
power
alters
the
federal-state--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--we
could,
i
believe.
that's
--
this
court--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--yes,
i
think
that's
right,
and
there--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i
assume,
and
i
haven't
studied
the
history
of
that,
but
i
assume
that,
just
based
on
the
demographics
of
--
of
the
military,
it's
like
--
likely
that
there
are
more
men
in
--
in
service
deployed,
and
that
more
women
and
wives
benefit
from
that
provision.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
yes.
and
--
and
we
have
not--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--no.
and
we
are
not
suggesting
that.
we
haven't
raised
that
as
a
point
in
our
briefs,
or
here
today.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
respond
in
part
--
and
i'm
going
to
accept
your
proposition
that
i
should
discuss
these
provisions
as
part
of
a
single
package
--
but
from
the
standpoint
of
states,
subsection
(d)
provides
a
separate
claim,
a
separate
basis
to
sue
states,
and
we
think
that
claim
is
incongruent
and
disproportionate
to
any
conceivable
unconstitutional
conduct
that
it
might
prohibit.
and
i
think
this
is
borne
out
in
the
case
law.
we
surveyed
the
40
federal
cases
that
we
could
find
under
subsection
(d).
only
two
involve
pregnancy-related
disabilities.
only
one
of
them
alludes
in
passing
to
headaches
arising
from
pregnancy
along
with
other
stress-related
conditions.
but
--
but
all
of
the
others
really
had
to
do
with
men
and
women
benefiting
from
this
leave
for
--
to
care
for
a
serious
health
condition.
so
i
would
really
emphasize,
in
response
to
your
question,
that
one
could
look
at
it
as
a
package,
but
from
the
standpoint
of
states
it's
a
separate
and
independent
claim
and
it's
an
extraordinarily
broad
one.
and
it
is
not
necessary,
not
simply
because
pregnancy
discrimination
act
claims
are
available,
but,
justice
alito,
there
are
ex
parte
young
claims
available.
in
--
in
response
to
your
question,
in
this
case
at
the
joint
appendix
pages
3
to
12,
the
amended
complaint
reveals
that
injunctive
relief
was
sought,
albeit
--
and
on
page
12
is
the
prayer
for
relief
--
it's
--
it's
not
clear
whether
that
relief
is
sought
under
title
vii
or
fmla
or
both.
but
the
reason
why
i
don't
think
the
claim
fails
separate
and
apart
from
any
sovereign
immunity
argument,
of
course,
ex
parte
young
is
not
--
does
not
protect
on
that
ground.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
yes.
there
is
discussion
in
the
record
of
the
disproportionate
impact
that
you
say.
but
what
--
what
is
left
out
--
well,
it
--
it
is
found
in
other
parts
of
the
record
that
--
the
relevant--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--yes.
the
--
i'm
sorry,
yes.
the
record
of
--
before
congress.
the
relevant
comparison,
we
think
is
not--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--i
--
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i
misspoke.
i
do
mean
the
legislative
history.
the
--
the
relevant
comparison
we
think
is
not
between
single
parent
families
who
were
predominantly
women,
but
between
working
families
where
it
could
be
two
parents
with
a
single
income,
man
or
woman.
it
could
be
a
family
with
two
incomes
but
neither
one
can
be
lost.
so
--
and
in
any
event,
i
think
we're
talking
now
about
a
disproportionate
impact,
which
--
which
would
not
state
an
equal
protection
violation.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
i
think
one
would
need
to
find,
as
this
court's
cases
have
emphasized,
a
widespread
pattern
of
unconstitutional
conduct
on
--
in
the
part
of
states.
and
i
think
the
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg,
that
you've
described,
do
not
flow
from
unconstitutional
state
action.
they
have
their
roots
in
other
socioeconomic
causes,
so--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
by
providing
the
very
sweeping
remedy
of
(d),
which
--
i
see
that
my
light's
on.
may
i--
mr.
john
b.
howard
jr.
--we
think
that
the
remedy
in
(d)
may
cover
the
types
of
concerns
you
referred
to,
but
i
--
i
would
emphasize
this
is
a
disproportionate
incongruent
remedy.
it
subjects
states
to
far
more
suits
for
unrelated
health
conditions
than
the
eleventh
amendment
should
permit.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
