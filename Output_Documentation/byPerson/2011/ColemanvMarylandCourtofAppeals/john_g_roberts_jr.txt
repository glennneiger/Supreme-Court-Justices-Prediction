justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1016,
coleman
v.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
mr.
foreman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
are
you
reading
from,
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
howard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
can
provide
this,
the
kind
of
relief
that's
sought
here
without
waiving
your
immunity,
right?
it's
a
matter
of
legislation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
just
get
back
to
the
discussion
before
about
how
(d)
relates
to
the
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
do
you
think
benefits
most
from
subsection
(e),
men
or
women?
that's
the
one
about
armed
services
obligations
at
the
time
the
law
was
passed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
foreman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
it
would
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--do
you
think
it
would
be
--
how
--
how
would
this
case
come
out
if
we
were
dealing
with
--
with
from
subsection
(e)?
do
you
think
that
should
be
treated
separately
than
the
prior
ones?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
--
if
we
think
that
you
should
look
at
these
provisions
separately,
where
with
respect
to
(d)
--
and
i'm
looking
at
one
of
our
prior
precedents
--
has
congress
unequivocally
declared
its
intent
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--unequivocally.
not
on
the
basis
of
implications
from
--
from
how
the
other
provisions
work.
but
if
you
do
look
at
(d),
is
there
anyplace
where
congress
unequivocally
declared
its
intent
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
--
your
--
the
answer
you
gave
to
my
request
depends
entirely
on
the
conclusion
that
(d)
is
linked
to
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
because
otherwise,
you
don't
have
the
argument
that
it's
precisely
relief
with
respect
to
a
discrimination
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
