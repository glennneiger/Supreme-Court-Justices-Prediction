justice
antonin
scalia
the
legislative
record
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
closed
record?
is
that
a
closed
record,
the
way
a
record
of
a
case
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
find
it
a
strange
expression
to
talk
about
"in
the
record",
when
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
legislative
history.
