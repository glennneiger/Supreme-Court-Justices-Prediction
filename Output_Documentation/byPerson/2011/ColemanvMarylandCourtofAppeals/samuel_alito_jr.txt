justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
following
up
on
justice
kagan's
question,
i
have
--
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
providing
12
weeks
of
leave
for
self-care
for
both
men
and
women
affects
the
incentive
of
an
employer
who
we
will
assume
has
an
inclination
to
discriminate
against
women
based
on
the
possibility
that
a
--
a
woman
applicant
for
employment
may
become
pregnant.
i
--
i
just
don't
see
how
that
would
affect
the
incentives
of
--
of
an
employer
in
that
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
(a)
is
not
at
issue,
right?
okay.
so
we're
just
dealing
with
(d),
which
concerns
a
serious
health
condition.
so
you
have
an
employer
who
is
willing
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
gender,
and
the
employer
has
two
applicants
for
employment,
a
man
and
a
woman.
and
the
employer
says,
well,
if
i
hire
the
man,
he
might
take
12
weeks
of
leave
for
a
serious
medical
condition.
and
if
i
hire
the
woman,
she
might
take
12
weeks
of
leave
for
a
serious
medical
condition
which
might
be
something
that
either
men
or
women
could
get,
or
it
also
could
be
a
sickness
related
to
pregnancy.
so,
there
still
is
--
there
still
would
be
an
incentive
for
this
hypothetical
employer
to
discriminate
against
the
woman.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
how
does
it
do
that?
that's
what
i'm
--
i
understand
that
and
it's
a
worthy
objective.
i
just
don't
understand
how
giving
both
men
and
women
12
weeks
for
self-care
affects
the
incentive.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
could
i
ask
you
this.
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
hold
that
it
--
that
congress
didn't
validly
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
subsection
(d),
would
your
client
still
be
able
to
seek
reinstatement
or
other
injunctive
relief?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
here
the
district
court
completely
dismissed
your
fmla
claim,
not
just
insofar
as
you
sought
damages.
i
--
i
think
you
also
sought
reinstatement
and
other
equitable
relief,
but
the
district
court
dismissed
it
completely.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
are
not
contesting
that,
are
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
said
in
this
case.
that's
basically
what
i'm
asking.
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
are
you
asking
us
--
would
we
then
simply
affirm
the
fourth
circuit?
or
would
we
have
to
--
would
we
have
to
make
some
accommodation
for
the
possibility
that
the
dismissal
of
your
claim
insofar
as
you
sought
injunctive
relief
may
have
been
improper?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
am
trying
to
be
a
little
bit
helpful
to
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
you
did,
but
maybe
i'm
reading
your
complaint
more
generously
than
you
read
it
yourself.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
for
the
applicants
for
particular
provisions
--
particular
positions,
i
should
say
--
where
the
applicants
are
typically
of
a
certain
age,
men
tend
to
take
less
sick
leave
than
women,
because
women
also
take
sick
leave
for
pregnancy-related
illnesses.
so
giving
everybody
12
weeks
eliminates
the
possibility
that
women
who
will
be
taking
--
want
to
take
additional
--
want
to
take
more
sick
leave
will
be
fired
because
they
exceed
the
amount
of
sick
leave
allowed
by
the
employer
for
everybody.
now,
isn't
that
connected
to
eliminating
discrimination
in
employment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
have
difficulty
with
the
incentives
argument
either,
honestly,
either
as
the
(d)
or
as
to
(c).
but
i'm
just
talking
about
an
argument
based
on
consequences.
if
an
employer
says
you
get
2
weeks
of
sick
leave,
period,
after
that
if
you
can't
come
back
you
are
fired,
that
may,
at
least
for
applicants
within
a
certain
age
range,
that
may
have
a
much
more
severe
or
a
more
severe
impact
on
women
than
on
men.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
the
answer
to
that
be,
that
that's
not
intentional
discrimination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
congress
had
added
three
additional
subsections
here,
and
said
that
an
employer
has
to
provide
12
weeks
of
unpaid
leave
so
that
an
employee
can
go
to
a
health
spa;
12
weeks
of
unpaid
leave
so
that
the
employee
can
travel;
12
weeks
of
unpaid
leave
so
that
the
employee
can
take
an
educational
course.
now,
those
could
be
taken
advantage
of
by
either
men
and
women.
it
makes
both
men
and
women
increasingly
unattractive
as
employees
and
therefore
reduces
any
special
disincentive
that
might
have
been
created
by
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
now
on
that
same
logic,
would
those
be
--
would
those
be
provisions
that
further
the
elimination
of
discrimination
based
on
gender?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
state
of
maryland
thinks
this
is
good
social
policy,
why
is
it
asserting
its
sovereign
immunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can
waive.
can't
you
waive
your
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
