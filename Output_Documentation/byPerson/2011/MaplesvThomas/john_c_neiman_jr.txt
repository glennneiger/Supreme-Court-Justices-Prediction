mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
trying
to
sidestep
coleman,
maples
is
advocating
at
least
three
principles
that
are
incompatible
with
the
way
our
justice
system
works.
first,
maples
is
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
due
process
required
not
just
actual
notice
to
his
attorney
of
record,
john
butler,
but
in
fact
something
more
than
that.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
would
be
a
much
more
substantial
argument.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
return
of
all
three
notices
would
justify
necessarily
a
finding
of
abandonment
in
toto
by
all
the
lawyers.
it
could
signify
a
number
of
things.
i
do
think
that
it
would
raise
questions
about
whether
the
clerk
had
a
due
process
obligation
to
do
more
under
jones
v.
black.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor,
although
the
presumption
generally
is
that
the
client
stays
with
the
firm.
but
that's
correct.
the
client
certainly
can
move
firms
when
the
--
a
lawyer
moves
firms.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
certainly
were
preparing
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
in
fact,
contrary
to
my
friend's
statements
about
what
we
know
about
mr.
de
leeuw's
involvement
in
this
case,
on
page
228
of
the
j.a.,
maples
expressly
alleged
that
de
leeuw
and
others
at
sullivan
&
cromwell
were
preparing
for
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that
assessment
of
how
we
can
read
the
service
of
the
rule
32
answer.
under
alabama
law,
a
pleading
or
an
order
may
be
served
on
only
one
counsel
of
record
when
a
party
has
multiple
counsel
of
record.
so,
for
example,
that
answer
was
served
upon
mr.
munanka
at
sullivan
&
cromwell,
but
it
was
not
served,
expressly
at
least,
on
ms.
ingen-housz.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state's
attorney
in
that
--
in
that
instance
decided
to
send
a
letter
only
to
mr.
maples.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
reveal
why
mr.
hayden
decided
to
send
the
letter
to
mr.
maples
alone--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
state
case
was
over.
so
it
was
hardly
clear
if
mr.
hayden
was
going
to
do
something
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
under
the
rules.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
he
certainly
was
aware
that
mr.
maples'
lawyers
had
failed
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
but
--
and
his
letter
reveals
that
he
is
very
aware--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
my
friend
that
we
don't
have
statistics
on
that
front.
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
for
the
most
part,
when
a
rule
32
petitioner
loses
at
the
trial
stage
they
are
going
to
appeal.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
there
are
some
instances
in
which
a
capital
petitioner
or
someone
on
death
row
decides
that
they
no
longer
want
to
invoke
the
process
of
the
courts
and
they
are
ready
for
their
sentence
to
be
carried
out.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
not
quite,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
notice
saying
that
the
person's
no
longer
at
sullivan
&
cromwell
indicates
that
the
person
is
no
longer
at
the
firm.
i
guess
the
notice
could
come
back--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
i
don't
think
the
law
makes
that
crystal
clear,
your
honor.
but
i
certainly
know
of
no
law
that
suggests
that
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
necessarily
has
to
assert
every
single
potential
defense
within
his
or
her
arsenal.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
perhaps,
your
honor.
it
--
it
would
depend
on
why
the
letters
came
back
from
sullivan
&
cromwell.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
the
cause
argument
in
that
case,
your
honor,
would
be
substantially
stronger
as
i
said
before
in
part
because,
death,
of
course,
is
an
external
factor.
so--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
we
would
be
prepared
to
recognize
that
in
certain
cases
an
abandonment
of
a
client
by
an
attorney
would
terminate
the
agency
relationship
with
--
between
the
attorney
and
client.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
one
thing
i
want
to
stress
is
that
my
friend
has
suggested
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
further
evidentiary
proceedings
are
necessary
on
this
particular
question
because
we
don't
know
what
role
the
other
attorneys
at
sullivan
&
cromwell
played
in
the
matter.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--i
disagree
with
that
assessment,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
that
inconsistency
in
maples'
argument.
on
the
one
hand
maples
says
that
butler
--
or
that
the
other
lawyers
at
sullivan
&
cromwell
weren't
his
attorneys
because
they
were
not
counsel
of
record.
but
butler
was
counsel
of
record
but
he
wasn't
for
the
attorneys.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
i
suspect
that
in
those
circumstances
i
might
well
personally
do
something
else.
but,
of
course,
my
prerogatives
as
solicitor
general
of
alabama
are
quite
different
from
the
prerogatives
of
a
clerk
in
northern
county,
alabama.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
the
--
as
far
back
as
mullane,
this
court
has
said
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
actual
notice
to
a
party,
particularly
within
the
jurisdiction,
is
the
finish
line
for
due
process
purposes.
mullane
expressly--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--there
are
several
responses,
your
honor.
first,
at
least
at
the
rule
32
stage,
the
notice
of
appeal
deadline
was
a
jurisdictional
one.
and
you're
right,
the
state
did
oppose
the
motion
for
an
out-of-time
appeal,
but
there
wasn't
much
the
state
could
have
done
even
if
it
had
consented.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
the
holding
of
the
alabama
courts
here,
as
recognized
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
was
that
this
would
not
be
an
appropriate
circumstance
for
an
out-of-time
appeal.
now
as
to
the
question
about--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--there
is
opportunity
where
there
is
good
cause
for
an
extension.
but
what
the
court
held
here,
or
what
the
alabama
court
held
here
was
that
this
circumstance
in
which
the
person
had
counsel
of
record,
and
counsel
of
record
hadn't
notified
the
court
of
their
changes
of
address,
and,
more
importantly,
mr.
butler,
if
he
was
in
fact
serving
as
mr.
maples'
agent
in
this
case.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that
seems
to
be
the
holding
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
did
oppose
the
out-of-time
appeal,
and
the
state
pressed
the
procedural
bar
in
federal
court
in
this
case.
but
the
state
had
every
prerogative
to
do
so,
in
part
because
this
court
recognized
in
coleman,
a
case
where
petitioner
undoubtedly
could
have
said
that
he
lost
his
right
to
he
appeal
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
the
state
had
the
power
to
do
that.
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
state--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
the
law's
not
exactly
clear
on
that,
but
i
know
of
no
law
that
would
say
the
alabama
attorney
general
--
the
alabama
attorney
general
has
to
press
every
single
non-jurisdictional
defense
at
his
or
her
disposal.
but
he
did
not
do
so
here
and
had
good
reason
not
to.
that's
in
part
because
coleman
says
that
this
is
how
procedural
defaults
work.
there
are
good
reasons
for
procedural
defaults.
they
are
grounded
in
the
same
equitable
principles
that--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
if
i
suggested
that
abandonment
itself
is
an
exception
to
the
aisg
doctrine,
let
me
correct
my
earlier
answer.
my
suggestion
is
that
abandonment
can
sometimes
allow
a
court
to
determine
that
a
particular
lawyer
has
become
external
to
a
client,
that
the
agency
relationship
has
been
terminated.
of
course,
merely
becoming
external
to
the
client
does
not
mean
that
the
abandonment
itself
will
constitute
cause.
the
abandonment
also,
or
the
lawyer's
ending
of
the
relationship
would
also
have
to
impede
the
ability
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
defense
team
or
the
defendant
himself
to
comply
with
state
rules.
and
here,
even
if
there
is
some
argument
that
ingen-housz
and
munanka
abandoned
their
client,
which
i
don't
think
there
is
on
this
record
in
light
of
the
way
they
left
the
case
with
butler,
mr.
de
leeuw
and
others
at
sullivan
&
cromwell,
even
if
there
were
some
argument
on
that
front,
butler
--
it's
not
clear
that
the
action
of
ingen-housz
and
munanka
actually
impeded
the
ability
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
team.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is.
but
i
don't
think
that
means
that
what
happened
here
constitutes
cause.
the
record
is
clear,
as
mr.
maples
himself
has
alleged,
that
ingen-housz
and
munanka
arranged
for
this
case
to
be
handled
by
mr.
de
leeuw,
and
the
record
makes
clear
that
mr.
de
leeuw
was
involved
in
this
case
in
representing
maples
even
before
the
default
occurred,
and
even
before
ingen-housz
and
munanka
were
--
well,
even
if
--
even
before
ingen-housz
and
munanka
left.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--your
honor,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
point.
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
the
state's
attorney
did
not
know
that
the
letters
had
come
back.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
most
--
most
attorneys
have
an
obligation
at
some
point
to
check
the
docket,
and
that's
--
that's
one
problem
with
the
position
that
mr.
maples
has
taken
regarding
mr.
butler
here
and
the
ability
of
these
parties
to
obtain
information
from
the
court.
but
in
this
case
it's
my
understanding
--
this
is
not
on
the
record
--
but
it's
on
the
record
obviously
before
this
court
now
--
but
it's
my
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
state
had
no
idea
that
mr.
maples'
attorneys
had
not
--
mr.
maples'
two
attorneys
in
new
york
had
left
their
firm
or
had--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--again,
this
is
--
this
information
that's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
but
it's
my
understanding
that
counsel
looked
at
--
looked
at
--
figured
out
what
had
happened,
figured
out
the
appeal
had
been
missed,
had
calculated
how
much
time
mr.
maples
had
to
file
his
2254
petition,
and
based
on
his
20
years
of
experience,
said
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
state
court
proceedings
were
over,
the
most
prudent
thing
for
him
to
do
would
be
to
send
the
letter
to
maples
himself.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
an
accurate
characterization
of--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--of
what
exactly
happened
in
this
case,
but
in
the
very
least
his
lawyers
had
missed
--
had
missed
the
deadline.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well,
more
so
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
no,
your
honor.
but
of
course,
the
cert
--
the
notice
came
back
to
the
clerk
long
before
the
state's
attorneys
sent
the
letter
in
this
case.
but
that's
an
important
point
i
think
both
with
respect
to
the
clerk
issue
and
also
the
abandonment
issue.
the
relevant
question
here
is
not
what
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama
thought
happened
in
this
case.
the
relevant
question
on
the
clerk
issue
is
what
the
clerk
knew,
and
that
of
course
is
governed
by
rule
7
of
the
rules
governing
admission
to
the
alabama
bar.
the
relevant
question
on
abandonment
is
had
maples
in
fact
been
abandoned?
had
--
had
these
attorneys
left
him
completely
without
counsel?
and
the
record
definitively
establishes
that
that
had
not
happened,
both
because
mr.
butler
remained
counsel
here,
and
in
a
much
more
meaningful
way,
i
think,
than
my
friend
suggests--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
of
course
that
information's
not
in
the
record.
we
respectfully
disagree
as
a
factual
matter
with
the
factual
assertions
made
by
the
amici
on
that
front.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
a
remand
would
not
be
appropriate
in
this
case
on
those
--
on
grounds
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
one
is
that
rule
7
of
the
rules
governing
admission
to
the
alabama
bar
made
emphatically
clear
that
the
role
of
local
counsel
was
not
simply--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--at
least
two-fold,
your
honor.
one,
as
a
simple
matter
those
factual
assertions
were
not
made
below.
so
in
order
for
the
court
to
remand
on
that
particular
issue,
it
wouldn't
be
a
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
on
whether
those
allegations--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--there
is
certainly
a
lot
in
the
briefs
that
says
that.
but
one
problem
mr.
maples
faces
here
is
that
he
had
the
burden
as
the
petitioner
in
this
habeas
allegations
that
he
believed
would
establish
cause.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
notice--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--right.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well,
the
--
the
cc
line
in
this
case
cannot
establish
cause
and
cannot
be
deemed
state
interference
for
any
number
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
--
i
suppose
it
could
only
be
held
to
establish
cause
if
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
mr.
butler
to
assume
that
the
cc
line
communicated
a
message
that
it
was
perfectly
okay
for
him
to
do
nothing,
and
to
not
take
further
action,
based
on
what
is
on
the
cc
line,
and
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
that
would
not
be
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
cc
line.
the
first
is
that
the
cc
line
doesn't
communicate
that
ingen-housz
and
munanka
were
the
people
listed
on
the
cc
line,
will
in
fact
receive
the
order,
all
it
says
is
that
the
order
will
be
sent
to
ingen-housz
and
munanka.
the
second
is
that
the
--
even
if
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
him,
for
mr.
butler
to
assume
that
ingen-housz
and
munanka
would
receive
the
--
the
order
in
this
case,
it
would
not
have
been
reasonable
for
him
to
have
done
nothing,
given
that
rule
7
of
the
alabama
rules
made
him
jointly
and
severally
responsible
or
--
to
the
client
and
to
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
yes,
well--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--i
--
your
honor,
i
guess
i
should
just
make
--
make
a
couple
points
in
response
to
that.
first
is
that,
as
i
understood
the
question
posed
on
the
cc
line,
that
is
all
about
not
abandonment,
but
whether
the
clerk
--
the
clerk's
actions
can
be
blamed
for
--
or
the
default
be
blamed
on
the
clerk.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
on
the
abandonment
question,
if
it
really
were
--
if
it
really
is
true
that
butler
had
decided
he
was
going
to
do
nothing
in
this
case
and
not
represent
his
client
and
not
be
an
attorney
for
the
client,
then
there
might
be
a
viable
argument
that
butler
was
not
--
was
not
--
had
abandoned
the
client
in
some
way,
but
that
is
not
the
--
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
exactly
what
the
allegations
are.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
not.
certainly
the
rules
provide
that
a
breach
of
the
rules
of
professional
responsibility
would
be
sanctionable
by
that
state
bar
--
both
against
the
alabama
attorney
here
and
the
new
york
attorney.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
well,
of
course,
we
discussed
in
the
brief
the
very
--
the
undisputable
fact
that
butler
filed
numerous
things,
and
the
act
of
default
occurred
in
this
case.
but
even--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--butler's
affidavit
certainly
--
the
filing
in
the
state
court
proceedings
certainly
doesn't
say,
"i
was
in
this
only
to
swear
these
people
in,
or
move
for
their
admission
and
nothing
else.
"
what
butler
says--
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
--butler
says
on
page
255(a)
in
the
petition
appendix
that
he
agreed
to
serve
as
local
counsel.
"local
counsel"
has
a
specified
meaning
under
alabama
law.
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
let
me
withdraw
any
suggestion
that
i
am
saying
that
butler
had
in
fact
done
something
that's
--
that's
clear
on
the
record.
my
time
is
up,
may
i
finish?
mr.
john
c.
neiman
jr.
the
--
my
point
was
that
butler
did
not
simply
agree
just
to
move
these
people
--
move
these
people's
admission.
butler
said
he
would
be
local
counsel.
and
the
role
of
local
counsel
is
defined
by
rule
7
and
includes
an
obligation
to
attend
hearings,
conferences
and
the
like.
