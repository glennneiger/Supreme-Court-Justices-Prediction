kagan
well,
who
says
that,
mr.
garre?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
that
point,
on
the
alabama
system
generally?
justice
elena
kagan
counsel,
can
i--
justice
elena
kagan
--what
do
we
know
about
mr.
de
leeuw's
role,
mr.
garre.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garre,
could
we
go
back
to
the
state
of
record.
you've
said
a
few
times,
and
your
brief
does,
that
the
record
is
skimpy
on
various
important
matters.
would
you
go
further
and
say
that
the
record
is
irretrievably
corrupted,
tainted
by
conflicts
of
interest?
justice
elena
kagan
the
notice
inquiry
is
supposed
to
be
a
pragmatic
one.
as
far
back
as
mullane
we've
said
that
the
question
that
we
are
supposed
to
ask
ourselves
is:
is
this
what
somebody
would
do
if
they
actually
wanted
to
accomplish
notice,
if
they
actually
wanted
the
person
to
get
that
letter.
so
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you,
general,
if
you
were
a
lawyer
in
an
important
litigation
and
you
send
off
an
important
letter
to
two
lawyers,
your
principal
adversaries,
as
well
as
to
a
local
counsel
who
you
think
may
not
be
involved
in
the
substance
of
the
litigation,
you
don't
know
for
a
fact,
but
you
think
there
is
some
substantial
likelihood
that
he's
not
particularly
involved,
as
local
counsel
often
aren't.
so
you
send
off
this
letter
and
you
get
it
back
from
the
principal
attorneys,
and
you
ask
yourself:
huh,
should
i
do
anything
now?
what
would
you
say?
justice
elena
kagan
justice
scalia
is
right.
i
am
assuming
that
a
letter
disposing
of
a
ruling
in
a
capital
case
issued
after
18
months
when
nobody
knew
that
that
letter
was
coming,
that
that's
an
important
letter
for
a
death
row
person
to
get.
so
justice
scalia
is
right
to
that
effect.
so
you
get
this,
and
you
say,
well,
you
would
have.
but
that's
the
question
we
have
to
ask
about
the
clerk
as
well.
the
clerk
--
the
question
for
the
clerk
is,
if
he
had
really
wanted
the
person
to
get
notice,
what
would
he
have
done?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garre,
how
do
we
distinguish
between
abandonment
and
simply
a
botched,
very
botched,
transfer
of
responsibility
within
the
law
firm?
