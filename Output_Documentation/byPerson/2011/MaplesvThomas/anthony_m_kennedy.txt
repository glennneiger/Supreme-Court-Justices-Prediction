but
he
didn't
have
a
mail
drop?
i
just
didn't
hear
what
you
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
--
if
i
may.
i
don't
know
if
--
i
don't
think
the
briefs
covered
it.
it
may
be
in
there.
do
you
know
in
alabama
and/or
nationwide,
in
how
many
capital
cases
there
is
no
appeal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
--
in
this
case
there
was
a
direct
appeal,
and
then
there
was
this
proceeding
that
we're
talking
about
here.
the
trial
judge
waited
for
18
months,
so
you
would
think
there
is
some
merit
to
the
underlying
claim.
any
statistics
on
whether
or
not
--
on
how
often
an
appeal
is
abandoned
or
not
pursued
in
this
kind
of
case?
no
statistics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
aware
of
the
allegations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
particularly
in
a
capital
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
have
two
questions
going
back
to
the
very
beginning,
when
we
were
talking
about
the
missed
address,
or
the
unreceived
mail.
when
the
notices
come
back
"no
longer
at
sullivan
&
cromwell.
"
that's
just
as
if
it
said
functionally,
don't
you
think,
"wrong
address"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
didn't
get
the
mail,
get
the
letter,
because
it's
sent
back.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
other
thing
while
i'm
talking
with
you,
and
it's
a
tangential
point,
perhaps.
could
the
state
of
alabama
under
your
laws
waive
what
you
allege
to
be
the
procedural
default?
if
you
thought
there
was
substantial
merit
to
the
underlying
claims,
even
though
you
take
the
position
that
they
ultimately
should
be
rejected,
could
you
have
simply
waived
the
procedural
default
and
allowed
the
appeal
to
proceed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
alabama
ever
waived
lack
of
timely
appeal
in
a
capital
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
goes
to
my
earlier
question,
and
continuing
justice
alito's
line
of
questioning,
if
the
state
of
alabama
had
told
the
state
court,
you
know,
under
all
of
the
circumstances
we
think
there
should
be
an
out-of-time
appeal
granted.
are
you
indicating
that
the
state
court
said:
well
that's
a
good
idea,
but
we
can't
do
it
because
it's
not
appropriate
in
these
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
state
in
the
federal
litigation
have
waived
the
procedural
default?
