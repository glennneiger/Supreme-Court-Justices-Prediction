justice
samuel
a.
alito,

where
do
we
look
--
where
do
we
look
to
see
that
it's
standard
practice
for
local
counsel
throughout
the
country
to
contact
out-of-state
counsel
when
something
like
this
is
received?
i
remember
a
case
from
the
federal
system
in
which
local
counsel
appeared
and
did
exactly
what
was
done
here,
moved
the
admission
of
an
out-of-state
criminal
defense
attorney,
who
then
tried
the
case
for
a
year,
got
sick,
and
the
judge
said
to
the
local
counsel:
come
on
in;
you
are
going
to
take
over
this
trial
and
try
it
for
the
next
6
months.
and
the
local
counsel
said:
whoa,
i
only
signed
up
to
move
the
admission
of
this
fellow.
the
judge
said:
that's
too
bad;
you
are
counsel
of
record
and
you
have
to
take
over
the
case.
i
don't
understand
that
what
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
here
is
that
far
out
of
the
ordinary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
putting
aside
the
question
of
local
counsel,
could
we
find
that
there
was
an
abandonment
if
the
law
firm
of
sullivan
and
cromwell
continued
to
represent
mr.
maples
after
the
two
young
attorneys
left
the
firm?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
does
the
record
show
that
they
did
not
represent
mr.
maples,
that
this
was
done
purely
by
the
two
attorneys?
is
there
a
finding
by
a
court
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
concede
from
these
questions
that
the
arguments
that
you
are
making
in
this
capital
case,
which
is
sui
generis,
are
pushing
the
court
to
consider
rules
that
would
have
far-reaching
effect,
such
as
a
rule
that
places
upon
a
clerk
of
the
court
a
constitutional
obligation
to
serve
counsel
with
important
documents
in
the
case
similar
to
the
constitutional
obligation
to
serve
initial
process
in
the
case.
and
the
question
that
i
would
like
to
ask
is
whether
this
--
the
--
whether
you
as
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
have
an
obligation
to
push
this
matter
in
this
way.
this
is
a
case
where,
as
i
said,
it's
a
capital
case,
as
we
all
recognize.
mr.
maples
has
lost
his
right
to
appeal
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
through
a
series
of
very
unusual
and
unfortunate
circumstances.
now,
when
his
attorneys
moved
to
file
an
out-of-time
appeal,
why
wouldn't
you
just
consent
to
that?
if
he
did
not
receive
an
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial,
why
not
give
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
that?
why
push
this
technical
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
no
possibility
under
alabama
rules
for
an
out-of-time
appeal
in
this
circumstance?
no
extension?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
a
discretionary
matter
or
is
that
a
flat
rule,
once
you
passed
a
certain
time
deadline,
you
are
out
of
luck.
there
is
no
opportunity
where
there's
good
cause
for
an
extension?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
troubling
to
me
about
the
abandonment
argument
is
that
--
is
the
fear
that
if
the
court
says
that
abandonment
is
cause,
there
will
be
many,
many
cases
in
which
the
allegation
is
my
attorney
wasn't
just
ineffective
and
negligent,
the
attorney
was
so
bad
that
the
attorney
in
effect
abandoned
me.
and
that
will
substantially
change
existing
law.
now
how
can
that
be
prevented?
