justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
disclaimed
to
who?
i
mean,
how
could
the
clerk
be
expected
to
know
that
the
local
counsel
really
isn't
taking
any
part?
i
mean
--
so
was
the
disclaimer
to
the
clerk?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
said
that
even
before
that.
in
the
rule,
you
said
the
rule
32
--
didn't
you
say
something
about
--
the
--
the
notice
that
went
from
the
prosecutor
to
maples
did
not
go
to
the
local
counsel,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
--
did
the
prosecutor
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
clerk
now.
the
prosecutor
had
a
filing
in
connection
with
the
rule
32
motion.
did
the
prosecutor
send
that
to
everybody?
maples
and
everybody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
seem
not
to
rely
on
what
the
state
as
prosecutor
did.
it
seemed
to
me
the
state
as
prosecutor
was
recognizing
that
maples
had
no
counsel,
therefore
sent
--
said
you
better
file
your
habeas;
this
is
how
much
time
you
have;
sent
it
just
to
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
practice
of
a
law
firm,
these
were
very
junior
people.
wouldn't
the
law
firm
have
to
have
some
involvement
in
giving
them
permission
to
provide
this
representation?
i
mean,
usually
there
is
something
like
a
pro
bono
committee
and
a
higher
level.
can
such
junior
associates
just
go
ahead
and
say,
we
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
our
time
defending
a
man
on
death
row?
wouldn't
they
have
to
get
some
kind
of
permission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
do
know,
though,
that
they
were
not
counsel
of
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
know
that
the
two
who
were
listed
of
as
counsel
of
record
were
not
representing
him
and
they
hadn't
told
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
neiman,
i
think
we're
blurring
two
issues.
we
are
not
talking
about
abandonment
in
this
respect.
we
are
talking
about
notice
going
to
no
one,
and
the
--
and
the
clock
ticking
from
a
certain
date
that
no
one
knows
about.
they
were
preparing
for
a
hearing
before
this
judge.
so
they
weren't
anticipating
that
he
was
going
to
rule
without
anything
further.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
--
as
far
the
record
shows,
de
leeuw
was
not
on
the
record
at
all.
there
were
three
counsel
of
record.
two
of
them
--
well,
let's
go
back
to
the
--
this
first
issue.
the
state
by
its
own
conduct
showed
that
it
didn't
regard
butler
as
any
kind
of
representative,
because
it
didn't
even
send
its
rule
32
response
to
butler,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
what
about
the
notice
that
he
had
lost
in
the
alabama
court
and
he
better,
if
he
wants
to
go
to
the
federal
court,
do
something
about
it?
that
notice
went
only
to
maples,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
mr.
garre
made
the
point
that
if
maples
were
represented,
that
that
would
be
improper,
to
send
a
notice
to
maples
alone.
so
the
state's
attorney
must
have
thought
that
maples
had
been
abandoned
by
his
lawyers
because
he
didn't
notify
any
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
know
they
were
counsel
of
record.
we
do
know
that
the
only
two
counsel
of
record
were
no
longer
representing
him
and
he
had
no
reason
to
know
that
they
weren't,
but
they
were
not
--
they
couldn't
represent
him.
the
only
two
out-of-town
counsel
were
the
two
who
disabled
themselves
from
representing
him
by
taking
other
jobs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
was
no
one
from
sullivan
&
cromwell
other
than
those
two
on
the
record.
so
on
the
record,
they
had
abandoned
him
and
there
was
no
substitute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
oppose
it?
did
the
state
oppose
the
out-of-time
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
--
when
lawyers
stop
representing
a
client,
as
the
two
did,
isn't
there
some
obligation
of
them
to
tell
the
client
and
the
court,
we're
no
longer
representing
you,
and
arrange
for
substitutions?
there
were
never
any
substitutions
on
the
record
of
the
other
counsel.
the
record
says
these
two
people
are
representing
them
both,
and
those
two
weren't.
they
never
told
the
court,
and
they
never
told
maples.
isn't
there
some
obligation
on
--
on
their
part
to
the
court
when
they
stop
representing
a
client
to
advise
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
they
--
why
did
they
send
to
maples
alone
the
notice
to
--
the
federal
habeas?
they
didn't
send
it
to
those
counsel.
where
did
they
--
what
made
them
send
it
--
send
that
notice
directly
to
maples
and
not
to
either
of
the
sullivan
&
cromwell
lawyers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
is
number
10-63,
maples
v.
thomas.
petitioner
cory
maples
was
sentenced
to
death
after
an
alabama
jury
found
him
guilty
of
capital
murder.
on
direct
appeal,
the
alabama
supreme
court
upheld
his
conviction
and
sentence.
maples
then
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
alabama
trial
court.
he
alleged
that
the
state
failed
to
secure
his
constitutional
right
to
an
effective
trial
attorney.
the
two
attorneys
appointed
to
represent
him
at
trial,
maple
stated,
lacked
experience
and
were
minimally
paid,
and
as
a
result
he
asserted
his
counsel
made
crucial
errors.
maple
state
court
petition
was
prepared
and
submitted
by
two
new
york
attorneys
serving
pro
bono
both
associated
with
the
same
new
york
based
law
firm.
because
the
two
new
york
lawyers
were
not
admitted
to
the
bar
in
alabama,
they
enlisted
an
alabama
attorney
to
move
their
admission
and
serve
as
local
counsel.
the
alabama
attorney
agreed
with
the
caveat
that
he
would
undertake
no
substantive
work
in
the
case.
maples'
attorneys
filed
his
state
court
petition
in
august
2001.
in
the
summer
of
2002,
while
the
petition
was
still
pending,
the
two
new
york
lawyers
left
their
law
firm
and
commence
employment
that
precluded
them
from
service
as
maples'
counsel.
neither
attorneys
sought
the
alabama
trial
court
permission
to
withdraw
and
neither
told
maples'
they
would
no
longer
able
to
represent
him.
no
other
attorney
at
the
law
firm
entered
an
appearance
on
maples'
behalf.
several
months
later,
the
alabama
trial
court
denied
maples'
habeas
petition.
the
court
clerk
set
notice
of
the
denial
to
the
two
new
york
attorneys.
those
notices
were
returned
unopened
by
the
law
firms'
mailroom.
the
clerk
also
sent
a
notice
to
a
local
counsel
who
assumed
the
new
york
lawyers
would
pursue
an
appeal.
he
therefore
took
no
action
in
response
to
the
notice.
with
no
attorney
of
record
in
fact
acting
on
maples'
behalf,
the
time
to
appeal
ran
out.
the
alabama
courts
subsequently
refused
maples'
request
to
file
an
out-of-time
appeal.
maples
then
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
federal
court,
again
asserting
he
had
been
denied
his
right
to
an
effective
trial
attorney.
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
rejected
the
petition
relying
on
maples'
procedural
default
in
state
court
his
failure
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.
the
sole
question
before
this
court
is
whether
on
the
extraordinary
facts
of
this
case,
there
is
cause
to
excuse
maples
state
court
default.
we
hold
that
there
is
and
therefore
reversed
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment.
attorney
negligence
or
oversight,
we
have
held,
does
not
provide
cause
to
excuse
a
procedural
default
and
we
do
not
hold
otherwise
today.
but
maples
alleges
something
graver
than
attorney
oversight.
he
contends
that
his
attorneys
abandon
him.
"i
was
unknowingly
left
without
an
attorney
of
record,"
he
complains
or
still,
he
pleads,
"i
have
no
right
to
receive
and
in
fact
did
not
receive
notice
myself
because
on
the
record,
i
had
counsel.
absent
any
reason
to
believe
i
was
unrepresented
and
therefore
would
have
to
act
personally
to
preserve
my
right
to
appeal,"
maple
stated,
no
just
system
would
hold
him
accountable
for
the
default.
we
agree,
the
attorneys
maples
thought
were
vigilantly
representing
him
had
abandoned
his
case.
they
did
not
so
informed
maples
or
the
alabama
court
nor
did
any
other
lawyer
at
the
new
york
firm
timely
seek
the
alabama
court's
permission
to
serve
as
substitute
counsel.
to
no
fault
of
his
own,
maples
and
inmate
on
death
row
was
left
unrepresented
at
a
critical
time
for
his
state
habeas
petition.
and
he
lacked
any
clue
that
he
better
fend
for
himself.
the
uncommon
combinations
of
mishaps
in
maples'
case,
we
hold,
provide
just
cause
to
excuse
the
procedural
lapse
in
state
court.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
