justice
antonin
scalia
who
says
so?
who
says
that
they
rely
on
--
you
have
a
local
attorney
and
you
have
to
have
a
local
attorney
for
the
case,
don't
you?
and
--
and
you
want
us
to
believe
that
the
local
attorney
is
--
has
no
responsibility
for
the
case
at
all?
is
this
really
what
the
--
what
the
law
requires?
i
--
i
think
there
is
a
serious
ethical
obligation
when
he
has
the
--
when
he
gets
the
notice.
he's
one
of
the
attorneys
for
your
client.
and
he
got
the
notice,
right?
that
one
was
not
returned.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
failed
to
check
with
--
with
the
new
york
lawyers
who
were
working
with
him.
why
is
it
--
why
is
the
state
responsible
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
even
if
local
counsel
is
as
you
--
as
you
describe
it,
and
nothing
in
the
record
establishes
it,
even
if
he
is
a
functionary,
surely
the
function
would
include
when
he
gets
a
notice,
that
he
makes
sure
that
the
--
the
people
who
do
the
real
work
know
about
the
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
perform
that
function.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
whom
did
he
make
that
clear?
you
said
he
made
it
clear
at
the
outset.
to
whom?
and
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
his
affidavit
after
--
after
the
fact,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
he
tell
the
clerk
of
the
court
that
that
was
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
you
know,
i'm
counsel
of
record.
he's
the
counsel
of
record,
right?
i'm
counsel
of
record,
but
i
don't
even
do
so
much
as
to
forward
notices
to
the
guys
that
are
doing
the
real
work?
did
he
tell
the
clerk
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
the
constitution
say,
by
the
way,
that
you
have
to
give
notice,
that
every
judicial
action
has
to
be
noticed
to
the
parties
to
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
rules
don't
--
don't
require
notice,
do
they.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
federal
rules
don't
say
it.
you
don't
have
to
give
notice
in
the
federal
rules,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
capital
cases
are
different?
if
you
are
going
to
go
to
jail
for
life
you
--
you
don't
get
notice,
but
if
--
if
it's
a
capital
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
mean,
it's
either
a
rule
for
all
criminal
cases
or
it's
not
a
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
--
if
it's
a
rule
for
all
criminal
cases,
the
federal
rules
are
unconstitutional,
you
are
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
are
in
court
and
you
have
a
lawyer,
it's
up
to
your
lawyer
to
follow
what
goes
on
in
the
court.
that's
the
assumption
of
the
federal
rules.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
assumption.
and
i'm
not
about
to
hold
that
--
that
they
are
unconstitutional
simply
because
an
extraordinary
requirement
of
notice,
which
is
not
required
by
the
constitution,
has
gone
awry.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
define
his
role
as
a
lawyer.
once
he
appears
before
a
court
and
says,
i
am
counsel
of
record,
he
has
certain
responsibilities.
it's
not
up
to
him
to
say
what
his
responsibilities
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
don't
extend
even
to
forwarding
notice,
even
to
making
sure
that
the
people
who
were
doing
the
leg
work
in
the
case
know
that
--
that
the
clock
is
running,
my
goodness,
i
can't
imagine
what
his
responsibility
is.
it's
not
up
to
him
to
define
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that
he
knew
all
of
those
facts?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
we
don't
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garre,
can
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
this
was
not
an
appeal.
the
question
was
how
many
capital
cases
is
there
no
appeal.
he
had
been
convicted
and
had
appealed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
direct
proceedings
were
over.
he
had
appealed
up
to
the
state
supreme
court.
did
he
seek
cert
here,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
did.
and
this
was
a
post-conviction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
may
be,
but
i
don't
think
it's
extraordinary
that
there
be
no
appeal
post
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
be
allowed,
but
it
would
not
seem
to
me
extraordinary
that
it
not
be
sought.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
line,
mr.
garre,
between
abandonment
and
just
plain
old
negligence?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
his
local
counsel
simply
goofed
in
not,
not
advising
the
people
that
were
doing
the
leg
work
in
the
case,
why
is
that
abandonment?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
up
to
you
to
produce
the
facts
that
would
justify
our
reversing
the
case
that
you
are
asking
us
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say,
we
don't
have
these
facts;
well,
send
--
send
it
back
so
i
can
--
no,
you
should
have
gotten
the
facts
in
the
first
place.
if
the
record
doesn't
show
the
things
that
you
need
to
show
to
get
this
case
reversed,
the
case
should
not
be
reversed,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
did
you
first
make
the
abandonment
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
it
first
made
in
the
--
in
the
request
for
rehearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
rather
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
abandonment.
the
attorneys'
actions
established
cause;
that
does
not
mean
abandonment
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
return
mean
when
you
get
--
get
a
notice
returned?
it
just
said
no
longer
at
sullivan
&
cromwell,
is
what
the
two
of
them
said,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
that
necessarily
mean
that
they've
abandoned
the
case?
it
just
means
you
got
the
wrong
address,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
only
thing
it
means
for
sure,
these
lawyers
are
no
longer
here
at
sullivan
&
cromwell?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
that
would
be
an
indication
of
abandonment.
can't
you
switch
a
law
firm
and
keep
the
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
he
didn't
have
to
send
the
letter.
that
letter
had
no
legal
effect,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
was
just:
by
the
way,
your
time
has
expired.
i
mean,
this
is
not
--
what
could
the
lawyer
do
about
it?
it
wasn't
a
required
notice
that
he
had
to
give
to
the
lawyer
or
to
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
just
made
this
extraneous
volunteered
statement
to
maples
instead
of
to
his
lawyer.
i
don't
know
what
that
proves.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
argument
is
that
on
the
record
or
not
is
determinative
for
the
out-of-town
counsel,
but
it
is
not
determinative
for
the
in-town
counsel.
the
fact
that
he
is
counsel
of
record
doesn't
count,
but
the
fact
that
those
two
are,
does
count.
and
only
when
you
combine
those
two
does
the
man
have
no
counsel.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
the
clerk
has
to
believe
that
it's
an
important
letter.
right?
it's
not
important
enough
to
be
required
by
the
federal
rules.
how
important
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
assume
that
he
had
figured
it
out,
that
--
you
would
have
to
impute
his
knowledge
to
the
clerk
of
court
to
--
to
find
the
--
the
fault
on
the
part
of
the
state
that's
alleged
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
tell
the
clerk
of
court
that
he
was
only
going
to
send
it
to
maples?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
neiman,
am
i
correct
that
under
the
alabama
rules
when
an
attorney
is
represented
by
more
than
one
attorney,
the
notice
does
not
have
to
go
to
all
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
only
go
to
one,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
as
far
as
local
counsel
knew,
he
was
the
only
one
to
receive
notice
of
this
thing,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
find
--
if
we
find
that
these
lawyers
did
abandon
their
client,
would
there
be
some
sanction
imposed
upon
them
by
the
bar?
i
often
wonder,
just
as
when
we
find
that
there's
been
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
in
a
capital
case,
does
anything
happen
to
the
counsel
who
have
been
inadequate
in
a
capital
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
ever
heard
of
anything
happening
to
them?
other
than
they
are
getting
another
capital
case?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
to
adopt
the
state's
position
that
he
was
not
abandoned,
we
have
to
adopt
your
position
that
he
was
abandoned.
