mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
factors
distinguish
this
case
from
those
in
which
the
court
has
found
cause
lacking
to
excuse
a
default:
first,
the
state
itself
had
a
direct
hand
in
the
extraordinary
events
leading
up
to
the
default
in
this
case;
and
second,
the
actions
of
maples'
attorneys,
which
rise
to
the
level
of
abandonment,
are
not
attributable
to
maples
under
agency
law
or
other
principles
that
this
court
has
invoked
in
determining
when
attorney
conduct
may
be
imputed
to
a
client.
for
either
or
both
of
those
reasons,
the
default
at
issue
in
this
case
is
not
fairly
attributable
to
cory
maples
and
the
contrary
decision
of
the
eleventh
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
--
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
couple
that,
though,
with
the
fact
that
the
state
initially
set
up
a
system
for
the
representation
of
indigent
capital
defendants
that
relies
extremely
heavily
on
the
good
graces
of
out-of-state
counsel
to
represent
indigent
capital
defendants
in
alabama.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
--
if
only
one
from
the
out-of-state
pro
bono
counsel?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
i
think
what's
remarkable
about
this
case
is
you
have
both
out-of-state
attorneys,
the
notices
come
back
marked
"return
to
sender,
left
firm.
"
in
an
envelope,
and
the
clerk
does
nothing.
and
what's
extraordinary
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
system
in
this
case
relies
on
the
out-of-state
attorneys
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
have
three
points
on
the
local
counsel,
your
honor.
first,
the
record
shows
that
the
notice
is
not
attributable
to
mr.
maples
because
mr.
butler
had
disclaimed
any
relationship
apart
from
facilitating
the
admission
of
the
out-of-state
attorneys.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
a
--
a
couple
things
on
the
clerk's
perspective.
first,
we
do
think
that
it
was
well
known
in
alabama
that,
under
this
unique
system,
out-of-state
attorneys
were
doing
all
the
work
in
these
cases
and
local
counsel
were
simply
facilitating
their
admission.
second,
one
of
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--a
couple
of
the
things,
your
honor.
first,
we
do
have
the
amicus
briefs,
which
discuss
that
anecdotally.
i
would
say
that
the
state
of
alabama
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
this
court
a
few
years
back
in
the
barbour
case
specifically
touted
the
role
of
out-of-state
attorneys
under
its
system
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
didn't
mention
local
counsel
once.
so
i
think
it
was
fair
to
say
that
it's
known
that
the
out-of-state
attorneys
here
were
doing
all
the
work.
but
even
if
the
clerk--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
--
what
--
i
think
the
clerk
would
be
imputed
with
knowledge,
general
knowledge
of
the
system.
but
beyond
that,
what
the
clerk
know
--
knew
was
this:
he
knew
that
two
of
the
three
notices
that
went
out
were
returned,
both
to
the
out-of-state
attorneys,
which
ought
to
be
an
extraordinary
event
in
the
life
of
any--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--of
course.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
this
case
the
local
counsel
didn't
perform
as
a
mail
drop
and
that
was
intentionally
so.
his
own
affidavit
makes
that
clear.
and
i
think
what's
important
is
the
state
itself
must
not
have
viewed--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--my
point
was
that
ordinarily
a
local
counsel
would
serve
as
a
mail
drop;
he
would
forward
notice.
in
this
case
mr.
butler
made
quite
clear
from
the
outset
he
was
not
even
performing
that
role.
the
role
that
he
intentionally
performed
was
to
admit
out-of-state
counsel
and
to
let
them
do
the
work.
but
the
state
itself--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
in
his
affidavit,
your
honor,
the
petition
appendix
page
256.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
did
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
did
not
tell
the
clerk.
but
the
state
itself,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--must
not
have
viewed
him
as
a
meaningful
player,
because
when
the
default
at
issue
in
this
case
occurred
the
state
sent
a
letter
--
faxed
it
--
to
mr.
maples
directly
on
death
row
in
alabama.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
clerk
sent
out
notices
to
all
three
attorneys
of
record,
the
two
out-of-state
counsel
and
mr.
butler.
mr.
butler
did
receive
the
notice.
he
didn't
do
anything,
both
because
he
hadn't
assumed
any
role
beyond
facilitating
admission--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--he
did
not.
the
state
--
and
this
is
at
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix
--
the
state
served
it
on
his
out-of-state
counsel
and
not
mr.
butler,
his
local
counsel.
and
when
the
default
occurred,
the
state
contacted
mr.
--
mr.
maples
directly
in
prison,
which
would
have
been
unethical
if
the
state
had
known
or
believed
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
absolutely
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
that
is
further
evidence
that
everybody
knew
that
mr.
maples
didn't
have
any
local
counsel
in
any
meaningful
sense.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
constitution
doesn't
say
that
explicitly.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
notice
of
a
post-conviction
order
in
a
capital
case
would
at
least
implicate
a
due
process
interest
in
receiving
notice,
that
it's
reasonable--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
under
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
mullane
case
specifically
takes
into
account
the
interests
of
the
individual
receiving
notice.
there
could
be
no
greater
interest
of
an
individual
than
receiving
notice
in
a
capital
case
where
the
individual's
life
is
at
stake.
ultimately
we
don't
think
this
court
has
to
find
a
constitutional
violation.
it
has
to
find
that
the
event--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--here
mr.
maples
did
not
have
an
attorney
that
was
serving
in
an
agency
role
in
any
meaningful
sense.
that
is
laid
out
in
this
ms.
demott
amicus
brief;
it
is
laid
out
in
our
case.
what's
more
is
the
state
didn't
simply
just,
we
think
quite
unreasonably,
rely
on
a
role
that
local
counsel
was
not
performing
in
alabama.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
--
the
ordinary
role
of
local
counsel,
which
would
have
been
to
at
a
minimum
forward
notice
in
the
proceeding,
would
be
a
meaningful
relationship.
the
relationship
that
--
that
professor
demott
describes
here
is
one
of
sub-agency.
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
the
alabama
rules,
they
put
the
onus
on
the
out-of-state
counsel
to
associate
the
local
counsel.
that's
at
page
365
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
out-of-state
counsel
did
that.
mr.
--
mr.
maples
was
not
involved
in
that
transaction.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
mr.
butler
--
just
simply
saying,
i'm
going
to
allow
--
i'm
going
to
facilitate
your
out-of-state
attorney
to
represent
you,
but
that's
my
role,
he
has,
quote,
unquote,
"no
role"
outside
of
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
clearly
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
exactly
our
point,
justice
scalia,
which
is
that
he
forswore
any
responsibility.
the
lawyer
in
the
holland
case
just
had
those
responsibilities,
too.
he
abandoned
his
client.
what
mr.
butler
here
did
here
was
inexcusable.
but
there
is
another
factor
at
play
here,
and
that
is
the
confusion
that
the
court
itself
affirmatively
created
when
it
sent
an
order
that
by
its
terms
directed
that
all
counsel
of
record
receive
it.
and
that's
what
the
order
said;
it's
on
page
225
of
the
joint
appendix.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--certainly
they
knew
that
they
were
counsel
of
record
in
the
proceeding.
i
will
let
my
--
my
friend
answer
that
question.
what
we
know,
though,
is
that
when
the
default
occurred
it
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
faxing
a
letter
directly
to
mr.
maples
in
prison,
which
would
have
been
unethical
if
it
believed
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
my
friend.
i
don't
--
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
--
to
establish
that
they
knew
that
these
out-of-state
attorneys
didn't
get
notice.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
very
actions
it
took,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
and
i
think
the
state's
actions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
we
know
--
we
know
what
action
it
took,
and
that
action
was
an
action
that
assumed
that
he
didn't
have
meaningful
counsel,
or
else
it
would
have
been
unethical.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
know
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
alabama
system
here
created
a
system
in
which
it
would
allow
for
appeals,
not
only
in
direct
appeals,
but
post-conviction
proceedings.
there
are
several
extraordinary
features
of
the
alabama
system
and
we
think
that
ultimately
they
helped
to
facilitate
the
extraordinary
and
shocking
events
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
they
would
be
attributed.
i
think
what
you
are
looking
for
is
whether
the
default
itself
is
attributable
to
maples.
the
new
york
--
what
the
out-of-state
attorneys
did
is
they
left
the
representation
without
fulfilling
their
duty
to
notify
the
court
or
mr.
maples.
mr.
maples
was
sitting
in
a
prison
cell
in
alabama
under
the
reasonable
belief
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel
who
would
appeal
if
an
adverse
decision
was
issued.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
direct
proceedings
had
concluded.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he
did.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
was,
but
when
the
state
sets
up
that
system
and
allows
for
appeals
it
can't
arbitrarily
deprive
it
of
an
appeal
based
on
the
sort
of
circumstances
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
that
does
not
allow
appeal
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
i
mean,
the
statistics
that
i'm
aware
of
are
that
habeas
claims
are
in
a
material
sense
often
successful
in
capital
cases.
we've
cited
those
in
our
reply
brief.
here
we
think
the
underlying
claims
are
quite
serious.
the
question
in
the
case
is
really
not
who
shot
the
victim.
the
question
was
whether
mr.
maples
was
going
to
be
convicted
for
capital
murder
or
murder
that
would
result
in
life
imprisonment.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
i
think,
going
back
to
the
court
and
the
clerk's
actions
here,
one
of
the
things
that
exacerbated
the
chain
of
events
here
was
that
you
had
an
order
which
directed
that
all
parties
would
be
served.
mr.
butler
did
say
that
he
saw
that
that
order
directed
that
the
out-of-state
counsel
would
be
served,
which
created
an
added
risk
of
the
likelihood--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
believe
that
alabama
may
appoint
them.
they
don't
provide
for
appointment
in
all
cases.
i
believe
georgia
is
another
state.
but
in
that
respect,
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--absolutely.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
vast
majority
do.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
and
that
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
they're
independent
grounds.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
state's
own
actions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
this.
there
are
independent
grounds.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
state's
action--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
with
respect
to
the
attorneys,
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
would
be
the
line
established
by
agency
law
going
back
to
justice
story's
time.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
it's
actually
more
of
a
situation
where
he
disclaimed
any
meaningful
role
at
the
outset.
i
think,
you
know,
the
real
abandonment
going
on
here
was
the
attorneys
in
new
york
who
left
without
notifying
the
court
or
their
client.
but
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
court
could.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there
is
no
not
a
finding,
but
we
think
that's
the
better
reading
of
the
record,
and
i
am
happy
to
explain
why.
but
most
importantly,
we
think
it's
irrelevant
whether
he
was
represented
by
the
law
firm
in
this
fictional
sense.
he
was
represented
by
individual
lawyers
in
that
proceeding.
they
were
the
ones
who
mr.
maples
agreed
to
have
represent
him
in
that
proceeding.
the
alabama
courts
make
specific
findings
that
mr.
maples'
lawyers
were
ms.
ingen-housz
and
mr.
munanka.
it
said
that
after
the
default.
at
that
time--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
one
would
ordinarily
expect
that.
and
we
are
not
condoning
the
actions
here.
i
would
say
that
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation
there
were
individuals
from
the
legal
aid
society
who
were
well
familiar
with
capital
cases
involved.
they
apparently
dropped
out
of
the
case.
but
we
know--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
we
know
is
what
mr.
de
leeuw
has
said,
which
is
that
he
was
involved
in
the
case
at
some
point.
it's
not
clear
what
his
involvement
was.
at
the
oral
argument
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
he
said
on
page
302
of
the
joint
appendix
that
they
were
awaiting
further
action
from
the
court.
so
we
don't
know
what
his
involvement
was.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate,
your
honor.
of
course,
we
think
the
court
should
find
that
the
holland
--
the
holland
exception,
or
more
particularly--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
right.
there
are
those
distinctions.
our
point
is
that
holland
recognizes
that
attorney
conduct
that
amounts
to
abandonment
is
external
to
the
client
under
agency
and
other
principles.
coleman
itself
recognizes
that
external
conduct
is
not
attributable
to
the
client
and
can't
be
a
basis
for
cause.
the
federalism
interests
are
simply
not
implicated
in
the
case
where
you
find
that
the
attorney's
actions
are
external.
and
we
think
if
you
look
at
the
principles
you
looked
at
in
holland,
agency
law
going
back
to
justice
story's
time,
the
principles
of
professional
standards
of
care,
you
would
find
that
an
abandonment,
of
course
that
must
be
external
to
the
client.
justice
alito
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
where
someone
is
not
acting
as
an
agent
in
any
meaningful
sense,
it
would
be
grossly
inequitable
and
unfair
to
attribute
the
agent's
conduct
to
the
client.
that's
the
principle
we're
asking.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
there
are
conflicts
of
interest
here.
they
are
laid
out
in
the
legal
ethics
brief.
the
sullivan
and
cromwell
attorneys
were
representing
mr.
maples
up
through
the
argument,
the
decision
in
the
eleventh
circuit.
but
i
think
for
purposes
of
what
this
court
would
do,
i
think
a
remand
would
be
appropriate,
because
if
you
conclude,
as
we
think
you
should,
that
abandonment
of
counsel
would
be
an
external
factor,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
for
further
proceeding.
we
don't
know
what
these
other
attorneys
were
doing.
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
absolutely
know
that
they
were
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
were
not
counsel
of
record.
mr.
maples
never
agreed
to
have
anyone
else
represent
him
in
a
way
that
could
bind
him.
the
alabama
court
specifically
found
not
only
that
they
weren't
counsel
of
record,
but
they
were
not
authorized
to
practice
in
alabama.
this
is
on
page
223
of
the
petition.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
asked--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
the
petition
did
include
a
request
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
think
the
problem
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
short-circuited
the
inquiry
into
counsel's
actions
because
it
believed
that
coleman
v.
thompson
applied
in
the
abandonment
situation,
and
where
a
court
made
that
kind
of
legal
error,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
send
it
back
and
say,
no,
coleman
v.
thompson
does
not
apply
in
extraordinary
cases
of
abandonment,
or
an
attorney's
actions
cannot
be
attributable
to
a
client
under
agency
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
we've
argued--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
explicitly.
now,
we
think
--
two
points
on
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
that
all
along
they
argued
that
the
attorneys'
actions
established
cause.
that's
why
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
that
and
rejected
it
erroneously
under
coleman.
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
this
falls
squarely
within
the
rule
of
escondido,
where
--
where
a
party
makes
the
claim
below
--
which
they
made
the
claim
here
that
the
attorneys'
actions
established
cause
--
can
make
new
arguments,
different
arguments.
and
i
think,
particularly
given
that
sullivan
&
cromwell
had
been
involved
earlier
in
the
case,
and
the
possibility
of
conflicts
of
interest
would
make
it
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
our
abandonment
issue,
which
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
explicitly
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
explicitly
--
we
think
it
is
properly
before
this
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
agree
that
this
is
a
sue
generis
case.
the
facts
are
extraordinary,
the
facts
are
shocking,
and
our
position
is
simply
that
under
this
court's
precedence,
the
extraordinary
facts
here,
mr.
maples
has
established
cause
to
excuse
the
default.
with
respect
to
local
counsel,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
state
communicated
directly
with
mr.
maples
in
extraordinary
dissent
after
the
default,
maybe
the
other
telling
thing
is
that
in
2006,
alabama
itself
limited
the
local
counsel
requirement
for
pro
bono
proceedings,
recognizing
that
it
could
only
create
problems;
it
didn't
add
anything.
with
respect
to
abandonment,
i
understand
understood
at
times
my
counsel,
my
friend,
to
acknowledge
that
abandonment
may
establish
an
external
event
with
respect
to
the
client.
if
that's
so
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
at
we're
at
a
minimum,
we
are
entitled
to
a
remand.
there
were
statements
about
what
was
clear
in
the
record,
and
i
think
at
a
minimum,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
a
number
of
things
that
this
court
would
have
to
get
into
if
it
were
going
to
consider
adopting
the
state's
position
that
mr.
maples
was
not
abandoned.
mr.
maples
was
in
a
prison
cell.
his
attorneys
of
record
did
not
tell
him
that
they
had
left
the
firm.
they
were
required
not
only
to
tell
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
you
have
a
record
of
the
attorneys
leaving
without
only
not
notifying
mr.
maples,
not
notifying
the
court,
and
not
obtaining
the
court's
approval,
which
is
required
by
rule
6.2
of
the
alabama
rules
of
criminal
procedure--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--working
through
agency
principles
that
go
back
to
justice
storey's
time.
working
through
principles
established
in
this
court's
decision
in
holland,
and
will
be
applied
in
holland.
the
lower
court
in
holland
issued
a
decision
and
found
that
mr.
collins
had
abandoned
mr.
holland.
using
this
court's
precedence
as
a
guide.
so
i
think
holland
already
recognizes
that
attorney
abandonment
can
be
extreme;
we're
just
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
same
principles
in
recognizing
that
what
is
external
in
one
context
can
not
be
not
external
in
the
other
context--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
flood
of
relief
in
such
cases.
i
expect
that
this
would
be
very
extreme.
i
think
the
facts
here
are
about
as
extreme
as
you
can
get.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
when
you
have
counsel
of
record
leaving
without
obtaining
the
approval
required
or
telling
the
court,
i
think
that
is
abandonment
pure
and
simple.
beyond
that,
you
would
look
to
agency
principles,
whether
it's
a
breach
of
loyalty.
this
is
going
to
be
a
fact.
you
would
want
to
get
into
the
facts,
although
i
think
it
is
a
very
high
bar.
i
think
the
holland
decision
makes
it
a
high
bar.
i
think
this
case
thoroughly
passes
that
bar,
but
it's
something
that
the
courts
will
work
out
applying
agency
principles
and
applying
the
court's
decision
in
holland.
recognizing
what
holland
said
in
this
case
isn't
going
to
create
a
new
rule;
it's
simply
going
to
extend
logically
the
recognition
that
attorney
abandonment
is
external
to
the
client
as
it
always
has
been
under
agency
principles.
with
respect
to
notice,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
find
a
constitutional
violation
on
the
state's
part.
it's
enough
for
cause
that
the
court
finds
that
the
state's
actions
are
external.
and
i
think
the
key
inquiry
is
what
justice
kagan
recognized,
which
is
you
look
to
what
a
person
who
is
actually
desirous
of
providing
notice.
in
this
situation,
the
clerk
got
two
notices
back,
"left
firm".
it
opened
it
up,
it
would
have
seen
an
order
for
a
capital
case
and
it
did
nothing.
i
don't
think
anyone
who
actually
desired
to
provide
notice
with
an
inmate
with
his
life
on
the
line
would
do
nothing
reasonably
in
that
situation.
mr.
maples
is
not
asking
to
be
released
from
prison.
he
is
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
present
a
serious
constitutional
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
a
federal
habeas
court
on
the
merits.
if
the
claims
are
as
manifest
as
we
think,
that
clearly
will
have
little
burden
on
it.
but
simply
allowing
those
claims
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
federal
court
will
go
a
long
way
to
preserve
the
legitimacy
in
criminal
justice
in
a
case
in
which
a
man's
life
is
at
stake.
