chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-63,
maples
v.
thomas.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
talk
about
the
state's
role.
i
assume
that
you
are
talking
about
there
is
the
failure
to
take
action
after
the
return
of
the
notices?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
put
--
putting
that
--
that
to
one
side,
what
if
only
one
of
the
three
notices
had
been
returned?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
but
--
your
case
it
seems
to
me
turns
critically
on
butler's
role.
how
--
how
much,
in
addition
to
what
he
did
or
didn't
do,
would
he
have
to
do
to
put
him
in
a
position
where
he
was
in
fact
representing
maples
in
your
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
the
new
york
lawyers
did
not
abandon
mr.
maples
prior
to
the
time
that
they
left
their
law
firm
in
new
york,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
their
conduct
prior
to
that
time
would
be
attributed
to
him,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
part
of
their
conduct
was
setting
up
their
arrangement
with
mr.
butler
where
he
would
show
up
as
counsel
of
record
but
not
really
do
anything.
so
why
aren't
the
consequences
of
that
arrangement
attributed
to
maples
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
neiman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
the
three
notices
are
sent
out,
all
three
of
them
come
back,
okay?
let's
even
go
further
and
say
the
prosecutor
knows
that
nobody
representing
mr.
maples
received
notice.
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
i
know
it
would
be
more
substantial.
that's
why
--
my
question
is
what
happens?
are
you
prepared
to
acknowledge
that
in
that
case,
mr.
maples
had
been
abandoned
by
all
of
his
lawyers,
it
was
known
to
the
prosecution,
and
therefore,
the
failure
to
file
the
notice
should
not
constitute
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
barring
collateral
relief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
he
do
it?
why
did
he
do
it,
then?
just
gloating
that
--
that
the
fellow
had
lost?
what
was
the
point
of
it?
he
must
have
thought
there
was
a
problem,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
accept
--
i
don't
mean
to
interfere
the
question,
but
so
you
accept
the
idea
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
malfeasance
and
abandonment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
then
the
only
thing
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
on
these
particular
facts
there
has
been
abandonment
or
not.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
from
your
perspective.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agreed
with
me
earlier
that
abandonment
is
an
exception
to
the
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds.
so
under
your
view
of
the
case,
coleman
was
not
necessarily
controlling.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
correct
or
does
the
notice
--
most
of
the
notices
i
see
list
the
people
who
have
been
served.
were
the
new
york
people
listed
on
the
notice
that
went
to
butler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
he
knew
he
wasn't
the
only
one
getting
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
he
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
was
supposed
to
get
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
--
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
butler
did
more
than
your
friend
suggested.
what
more
did
he
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
after
the
default,
sure.
but
what
did
he
do
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
did
he
do
more
than
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
made
a
fairly
serious
suggestion
that
your
friend
did
not
accurately
represent
what
he
did.
and
you
still
hadn't
told
me
one
thing
he
did
more
than
move
the
admission
of
the
out-of-town
attorneys.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
garre,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
not
been
dawdling.
she
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
three
cases
today.
