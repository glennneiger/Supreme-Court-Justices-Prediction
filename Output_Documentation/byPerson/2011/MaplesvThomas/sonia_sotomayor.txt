justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
are
begging
the
question,
which
is
how
is
the
clerk
supposed
to
know
this?
this
is
a
functionary
in
the
clerk's
office
who
sends
out
notices,
receives
back
mail
that's
not
returned.
there
has
to
be
some
local
counsel
that
does
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
he
supposed
to
know
the
difference
between
those
that
do,
and
those
that
don't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre,
i
have
two
questions
for
you.
is
that
--
is
this
state
the
only
one
that
doesn't
appoint
counsel
in
a
post-conviction
capital
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
vast
majority
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
capital
cases.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
number
two,
i
thought
there
were
two
questions
in
this,
in
this
part
of
your
case.
the
first
is,
don't
we
have
to
decide
that
abandonment,
which
you
have
termed,
is
cause--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
a
--
to
excuse
a
procedural
bar
in
a
state
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
have
to
decide
first
whether
we
extend
holland
to
this
setting.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
due
process.
i'm
talking
about
--
yes,
both
we
would
have
to
decide.
but
assuming
--
we
have
to
decide
the
first
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
will
we
extend
holland
to
this
type
of
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre,
we
don't
know,
we
don't
know.
isn't
that
just
proof
that
if
we
were
to
find
that
holland
applied,
the
holland
exception
applied,
that
we
would
have
to
remand
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
that
regard,
there
is
one
part
of
holland
that
you
don't
really
address,
which
is
that
holland
contrasted
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
with
respect
to
access
to
a
federal
court
with
a
procedural
bar
and
said
that
the
state's
procedural
bar
had
interest
of
federalism,
that
we
had
to
be
cautious
of
ignoring
a
state
procedural
bar
because
of
federalism.
if
we
were
to
extend
holland
in
the
way
you
want,
how
do
we
justify
ignoring
federalism
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
surprising?
i
think
justice
kennedy
asked
your
adversary:
how
often
do
appeals
lie
from
the
denial
of
state
post-conviction
remedies?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
a
capital
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
we
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
initial
question?
let's
assume
the
two
letters
went
to
sullivan
&
cromwell
and
came
back,
"left
firm",
as
they
did,
and
that
the
letter
to
butler
came
back
"deceased".
would
there
be
cause
in
that
situation
to
excuse
the
state's
procedural
ground?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
we
know
that
both
lawyers
in
this
case
didn't
move
to
another
firm.
both
of
them
took
jobs
that
precluded
them
from
representing
this
defendant.
so
i
don't
know
how
i
define
abandonment
other
than
i
take
a
job
where
i
can't
work
for
you
anymore.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
he
had
figured
out
that
something
had
terminated
the
relationship
between
mr.
maples
and
his
lawyers?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
could
you
tell
me
--
i'm
assuming
you
have
practiced
in
your
state
for
a
while.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
frequent
is
it
in
the
alabama
capital
system
that
local
counsel
takes
the
laboring
oar,
or
even
an
active
participation
in
the
defense
or
actions
of
a
capital
defendant?
your
--
the
amici
here
says
generally
they
did
what
mr.
butler
did,
they
just
facilitated
the
--
the
admission
of
the
volunteer
attorneys.
was
that
your
experience?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
the
problem
is,
accept
the
rule;
it
exists.
but
if
a
lawyer
says,
"i
don't
care,
i'm
not
going
to
do
whatever
the
rules
require
me
to
do.
"
what
more
do
you
need
for
abandonment?
if
a
lawyer
comes
in
and
says,
"i
understand
this
is
a
rule
of
the
court.
"
"i
understand
that
i'm
supposed
to
do
x,
y,
and
z.
"
"i
don't
care.
"
"i'm
just
not.
"
that's
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
difference
between
"i
don't
care"
and
abandonment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
are
not
talking
about
the
notice
issue,
we
are
talking
about
the
abandonment
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
know
how
often
holland's
brief
has
been
granted
--
since
it's
very
recent,
but
how
--
how
--
how
frequently
collins
relief
has
been
granted
by
the
courts
below?
