justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
get
to
the
court,
could
i
ask
you
about
what
the
state
attorney,
the
prosecuting
attorney,
knew?
did
the
prosecuting
attorney
know
that
these
two
individuals
from
new
york
were
representing
this
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
think
you
have
--
in
your
view,
the
counsel
of
record
knew
that
these
two
people
in
new
york
were
part
of
the
representation.
did
the
counsel
--
i
mean,
not
the
counsel
of
record,
the
counsel
for
the
state.
did
the
counsel
know
that
they
hadn't
gotten
the
notice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
the
state
attorney
or
whoever
was
prosecuting
thought
that
the
local
counsel
was
likely
not
to
do
much?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
so
it's
possible
--
we
will
find
out
later
--
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
works
for
the
state
knew
all
those
things:
one,
he's
represented
by
counsel
in
new
york;
two,
they
didn't
get
the
notice;
three,
the
local
attorney
isn't
going
to
do
anything;
and
conclusion:
they
likely
knew
he
didn't
get
the
notice,
but
they
are
asserting
that
this
is
an
adequate
state
ground
to
bar
him
coming
in
to
habeas;
is
that
the
correct
posture
of
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
all
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
under
these
circumstances
the
state
attorney's
knowledge
of
all
those
facts
mean
that
the
state
cannot
assert
this
is
an
adequate
state
ground?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
--
is
it
--
i'm
still
unclear
on
one
factual
thing.
did
the
state's
attorneys
know
that
the
letters
had
come
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
should
they
have
known.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
check
--
do
they
check
the
docket
every
so
often
to
see
what's
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
we
have
to
send
it
back.
i
guess
we'd
have
to
say
what
the
rule
is.
so
what
--
what
is
the
rule
--
what
about
a
rule
that
says,
where
in
fact
attorneys
do
abandon
the
client,
and
the
local
attorney
does
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
state
do
virtually
nothing
except
to
facilitate
foreign
representation,
and
where
the
state
had
cause
to
believe
--
cause
to
believe
that
all
that
was
true.
then
the
state
cannot
assert
this
as
an
adequate
ground.
that's
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
irrespective
of
what
the
rules
were,
you
would
have
to
show
that
--
you
would
have
to
show
that,
in
fact,
in
this
state
it
is
a
practice
such
that
the
local
counsel
doesn't
do
much
of
anything
except
facilitate,
because
this
is
a
state
of
mind
as
to
whether
the
state
--
and
the
state
knows
that.
if
he
shows
both
of
those
things,
and
shows
that
the
letter
came
back,
and
shows
this
was
abandonment
or
close
thereto,
then
the
state
ought
to
know
that
this
individual
had
no
idea
about
filing
a
piece
of
paper,
and
thinks
somebody
else
is
doing
it.
and
that's
enough
to
say
this
is
not
adequate
state
ground
that
would
block
federal
habeas.
now
your
argument
against
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
in
the
briefs
--
there
is
certainly
a
lot
in
the
briefs
that
seems
to
say
that.
