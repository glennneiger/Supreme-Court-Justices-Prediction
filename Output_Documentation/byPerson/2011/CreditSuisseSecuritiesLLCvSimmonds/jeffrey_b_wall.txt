mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
where
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
did,
because
if
you
picked
up
this
statute
it
would
look
for
all
intents
and
purposes
like
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
question
then
is,
how
has
congress
rebutted
that
presumption
of
equitable
tolling
either
as
a
matter
of
text,
context
or
structure?
and
as
i
understand
it,
petitioners
have
two
basic
arguments,
both
of
which
are
incorrect.
the
first
is
textual.
they
say,
well,
it
runs
from
the
time
of
the
complained-of
event.
but
the
reason
they
can't
put
too
much
weight
on
that,
justice
alito,
is
because
if
they
looked
through
the
statutes
and
the
court's
cases,
they
would
come
across
cases
like
exploration
company,
or
delaware
state
college,
where
the
statute
ran
from
the
time
of
the
complained-of
event
and
this
court
treated
it
as
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations
subject
to
applicable
for
tolling.
and
they'd
come
across
beggerly,
which
ran
from
accrual,
and
yet
the
court
said
statute
of
repose,
not
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
normally
what
congress
does
is
it
says
there
should
be
no
jurisdiction
after
a
particular
time,
because
it's
not
trying
to
differentiate
among
the
application
of
different
equitable
background
principles.
but
there
are
statutes--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
where
you
have
statutes
that
say
there
shall
be
no
jurisdiction
after
a
particular
time,
this
court
has
read
them
to
cut
off
equitable
tolling
after
that
time.
but
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
to
say
the
time
limit
shall
not
be
tolled.
and
there
are
statutes
like
that.
now,
most
of
those
statutes
say
there
shall
be
no
tolling
except
in
particular
circumstances,
because
congress
has
considered
it
more
finely.
but
they
could
make
the
prohibition
absolute.
and
the
second
argument
that
i
understand
petitioners
to
have
is
basically
structural.
they
say,
well,
look,
they
borrowed
the
language
from
the
outer
prong
of
the
two-prong
limit.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
you
mean
other
than
statutes
as
in
merck
and
lampf,
et
al.,
where
there
were
tiered
structures?
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
that
the
statute
in
beggerly
was
an
example
where
the
court
said,
even
though
it
runs
from
accrual,
it
incorporates
a
discovery
rule
and
it
sets
a
12-year
limit.
so
textually
and
contextually
--
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
classic
formulation.
i
think
that's
why
petitioners
can't
point
you
to
anything,
because
the
courts
always
look
to
all
the
indicia
of
statutory
meaning:
text,
context
and
structure.
so
the
same
language
can
create
a
statute
of
limitations
or
repose.
so
in
lampf
and
merck,
if
those
statutes
hadn't
had
a
two-tiered
structure,
just
the
language
of
the
outer
prong
of
the
statute
alone,
i
think
the
court
would
have
treated
it
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
didn't
say
in
lampf
that
language
creates
a
statute
of
repose,
full
stop.
it
drew
a
structural
inference
by
looking
at
both
of
the
prongs
and
comparing
them
to
each
other.
so
when
petitioners
say,
whoa,
but
they've
borrowed
the
language
of
the
outer
limit
and
we
know
that's
repose,
well,
we
only
know
it's
repose
in
the
two-pronged
provisions
because
of
their
structure.
and
this
provision
doesn't
have
that
structure.
so
i
don't
think
i
can
point
you
to
any
classic
formulation,
because
the
same
words
can
be
either
limitation
or
repose,
depending
on
what
else
congress
does
in
that
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
i
don't
know
what
else
to
say
except
that
that
would
overrule
exploration
company
and
delaware
state
college.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
that's
right,
but
the
--
the
reason
that
that
language
created
a
period
of
repose
was
because
of
the
structural
inference.
i
took
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
to
be
if
the
statute
just
said
no
suit
shall
be
brought
more
than
x
years
after
the
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
--
i
think
the
implication
would
be
that
in
the
others
congress
created
a
period
of
repose
by
using
very
specific
language
to
do
that.
and
in
the
third,
it
didn't.
it
wrote
it
like
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
now,
it
could
have
written
it
differently,
justice
scalia.
it
could
have
said
"no
suit
shall
be
brought
after
x
time.
"
which
is
the
ordinary
language
of
statute
of
limitations.
"and
that
time
shall
not
be
tolled.
"
congress
has
done
that
in
other
statutes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no
question.
that's
certainly
true.
if
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
is
the
one
place
in
everything
mr.
landau
said
where
there
is
daylight
between
the
petitioners'
position
and
ours.
in
the
government's
view,
the
traditional
equitable
rule
is
the
statute
is
tolled
until
the
plaintiff
has
actual
or
constructive
notice
of
the
facts
underlying
her
claim.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
concealment
of
those
facts
by
the
defendant
that
gives
rise
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--absolutely.
and
i
think
in
many
fraud
and
concealment
cases,
where
you
are
not
talking
about
a
duty
of
disclosure,
either
common
law
or
statutorily,
you
do
have
affirmative
misconduct.
but
it's
a
different
question
when
congress
has
come
in
and
told
the
defendants
by
law
what
they
have
to
do.
for
the
defendant
then
to
breach
that
statutory
duty
--
i
think
congress
has
already
told
them
what
they
have
to
do
in
this
context.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that
just
goes
to
justice
ginsburg's
point,
i
think,
which
is
that
where
a
plaintiff
can
sufficiently
plead
a
section
16(b)
case
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage
to
survive
dismissal
under
iqbal
and
twombly,
everyone
agrees
that
if
you've
got
a
16(b)
potential
violation,
you
have
got
a
reporting
duty
under
16(a).
you
can't
have
liability
for
a
trade
under
(b)
that
you
weren't
required
to
report
under
(a).
so
if
the
plaintiff
can
sufficiently
plead
a
case
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage
under
16(b),
by
definition
the
plaintiff
has
sufficiently
pleaded
that
the
defendant
violated
a
reporting
obligation--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right.
but
16(a),
except
for
the
criminal
sanctions,
is
a
strict
liability
provision.
if
you
are
an
insider
and
you
fail
to
file,
you've
violated
16(a).
now,
you
know,
it's
a
separate
question
on
16(b),
but
i
think
everyone
here
agrees
that
if
you
have
a
violation
of
(b)
you
necessarily
have
a
violation
of
(a).
you
can't
be
forced
to
disgorge
the
profits
from
a
trade
you
weren't
required
to
report.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
the
--
the
breach
of
a
duty,
a
statutory
or
common
law
duty,
especially
where
that
duty
is
designed
to
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
a
private
right
of
action,
is
and
has
been
considered
by
courts
to
be
concealment.
without
looking
at
whether
the
fiduciary
just
accidentally
or
inadvertently--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i
want
to
fight
the
premise.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
we
have--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--you
are
absolutely
right.
they
are
both
bad.
we've
occupied
the
reasonable
middle
ground.
hope
you
like
it.
[laughter]
