justice
elena
kagan
but
what
takes
you
out
of
that
background
rule
in
this
case?
you
don't
have
the
two-pronged
structure,
which
really
did,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
drive
the
analysis
when
we
--
when
we
talked
about
those
provisions.
so
that's
not
there.
so
what
takes
you
out
of
the
default
position,
which
is
equitable
tolling
applies?
justice
elena
kagan
the--
justice
elena
kagan
--right.
but
i
guess
i'm
still
not
understanding
why,
if
you
look
at
this
provision,
you
would
think
of
this
as
anything
other
than
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations.
what
is
it
about
this
provisions
--
or,
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
--
i
mean,
you
can
--
you
can
make
structural
arguments.
but
--
but
you
know,
what
factors
do
you
think
in
this
provision
makes
it
a
statute
of
repose?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
could
turn
the
argument
around
on
you.
congress
surely
knew
how
to
write
a
statute
of
repose,
because
it
did
it
in
this
statute,
but
it
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
violations.
this
statute
of
limitations,
i'm
going
to
call
it,
reads
very
differently
from
the
two-pronged
positions
that
we've
interpreted
in
the
past.
justice
elena
kagan
judge
posner,
mr.
landau,
has
a
theory
for
why
it
is
that
fraud
is
treated
differently
from
the
16(b)
offenses,
and
it's
that
it's
much
more
important
to
prevent
strategic
behavior
involving
timing
in
fraud
suits
--
the
stock
price
goes
up,
the
stock
price
goes
down
--
whereas
in
these
suits
damages
are
fixed.
it
doesn't
really
matter
where
you
bring
them,
so
it's
not
nearly
as
important
to
set
a
clear
limit.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
have
one
theory,
which
deals
with
culpability;
and
he
has
another
theory,
which
deals
with
strategic
behavior.
and
i
don't
know
how
to
pick
between
those
two
theories,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
the
text
doesn't
suggest
which
one
congress
was
thinking
about.
and
that
puts
me
back,
and
let's
look
to
this
provision,
and
this
provision
looks
like
an
ordinary
vanilla
statute
of
limitations.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
landau,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
one
or
both
of
those
two
things,
wouldn't
the
normal
course
be
to
remand?
and
what's
your
best
argument
for
why
we
should
decide
it?
justice
elena
kagan
but
is
that
right,
mr.
wall?
i
mean,
don't
we
usually
look
when
we
are
thinking
about
equitable
doctrines
as
to
whether
the
defendant
has
clean
hands?
you
know,
whether
the
defendant
is
culpable
or
not
seems
to
matter
a
good
deal
when
we
are
thinking
about
considerations
of
equity.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
mr.
landau's
point
--
it
was
a
strong
part
of
his
brief,
i
think
--
was
that
there
was
no
reason
why
his
clients
would
have
thought
that
they
had
a
disclosure
obligation
in
the
first
place.
so
it
wasn't
that
they
were
looking
at
this
disclosure
application
and
saying:
we
don't
feel
like
it.
they
were
saying:
we're
not
covered
by
it.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
you
are
arguing
against
the
most
extreme
position.
another
position
is
just
regardless
of
whether
there's
been
a
filing,
if
the
person
knew
or
should
have
known,
if
a
reasonable
person
would
have
known,
even
if
there
were
no
filing,
that's
enough.
justice
elena
kagan
so
that
would
be--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
--
mr.
tilden,
is
there
any
other
context
in
which
we
would
extend
the
statute
--
or
we
have
extended
or
any
court
has
extended
a
statute
of
limitations
without
requiring
that
the
plaintiff
be
reasonably
diligent?
can
you
point
to
any
other
example
of
that?
