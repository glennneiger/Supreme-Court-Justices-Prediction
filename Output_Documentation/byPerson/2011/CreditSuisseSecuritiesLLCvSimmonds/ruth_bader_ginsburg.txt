on
your
first
--
on
your
first
point,
you
cite
lampf,
but
lampf
had
two
limits.
so
it
said
--
what
was
it,
1
year
from
whatever
--
from
discovery?
and
then
it
set
an
outer
limit
at
3
years,
and
it
was
the
same
thing
in
merck.
here
we
just
say
--
it
just
has
what
seems
to
me
a
plain
vanilla
statute
of
limitations
that
is
traditionally
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
we
don't
have
that
special
kind
of
a
statute
that
gives
you
one
limit
and
then
sets
up
a
further
limit
that
will
be
an
outer
limit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
is
it
reads
like
dozens
of
statutes
of
limitations.
it
says:
no
suit
more
than
2
years;
and
that
i
think
there's
the
general
understanding
that
that
limitation,
that
kind
of
limitation,
there
is
a
presumption
that
it
is
subject
to
equitable
tolling,
forfeiture,
waiver.
and
why,
if
this
one
doesn't
use
any
different
words
--
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
it
--
it's
not
simply
prophylactic.
i
mean,
there
is
an
objective
that
16(a)
expresses.
that
is,
congress
wanted
these
trades
to
be
reported
and
to
have
this
form
filed,
form
4
filed.
so
it's
a
--
it's
a
disclosure-forcing
provision,
16(a)
is.
then
why
would
congress
mean
for
it
to
operate
to
immunize
a
defendant
who
has
not
made
that
filing,
and
who
has
concealed
what's
supposed
to
be
reported
in
16
--
under
16(a)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
second
circuit
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
had
to
accept
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
as
true.
you
may
well
be
right
that
they
really
knew
or
they
should
have
known.
but
at
this
stage
we
can't
make
that
judgment
because
we
have
to
accept
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
as
true.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
extinguish
the
claim
--
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
terminate
the
claim.
it
just
says
you
can't
get
a
remedy
if
you
sue
too
late.
but
there
are
statutes
that
say
you
have
no
claim
after
x
time,
and
that
would
certainly
be
a
repose.
you
have
no
right
anymore
after
that.
