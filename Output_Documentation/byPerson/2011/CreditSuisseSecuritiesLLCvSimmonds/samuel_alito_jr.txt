justice
samuel
a.
alito,

is
that
--
is
that
true?
if
we
were
to
look
at
all
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
--
in
the
u.s.
code,
we
would
find
that
they
are
generally
or
exclusively
drafted
like
section
1658,
the
general
statute
of
limitations
provisions,
and
are
geared
to
or
are
triggered
by
the
accrual
of
the
action
rather
than
some
event?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
turn
away
from
the
statute
of
repose,
could
i
just
ask
you
one
more
question--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--on
--
on
that?
if
--
if
16(a)
reports
are
not
filed,
how
likely
is
it
that
a
potential
16(b)
plaintiff
will
find
out
within
the
2-year
period
that
there
were
these
trades?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
--
what
are
the
other
filings
that
might
disclose
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
were
drafting
a
statute
of
repose,
how
would
you
phrase
it
other
than
the
way
this
is
phrased?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
do
you
have
an
example
of
a
--
a
classic
statute
of
repose
that
we
--
i
could
look
at
to
see
how
they
should
be
phrased,
and
not
one
that
says
that
there
shall
be
tolling
--
there
shall
not
be
tolling
except
in
some
circumstances,
one
that
just
says,
"this
is
it;
no
tolling
whatsoever?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
a
standalone
provision.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now
why
is
that
true?
somebody
could
be
a
--
an
insider
without
knowing
that
the
person
was
an
insider.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
understand
that.
but
i
thought
the
point
was
--
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
there
is
the
kind
of
concealment
that
would
invoke
equitable
tolling
when
the
concealment
is
not
done
knowingly,
when
it
is
not
done
in
--
in
knowing
breach
of
a
disclosure
obligation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
as
a
matter
of
language,
whether
or
not
16b
is
a
--
whether
it's
a
statute
of
a
repose
or
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
tells
you
exactly
when
the
time
is
supposed
to
begin
to
run,
from
the
--
from
the
realization
of
the
profit.
and
you
want
to
say
no,
it
doesn't
begin
to
run
from
that
point,
it
begins
to
run
from
the
point
when
some
other
completely
different
external
event
occurs,
if
it
ever
does
occur,
which
is
the
filing
of
the
16a
report.
texturally,
how
do
you
get
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
it
requires
actual
--
is
that
right?
it
requires
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
that
make
any
sense,
given
the
--
the
class
of
individuals
who
are
plaintiffs
in
16(b)
cases?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
somebody
who
--
who
is
found
for
purposes
of
litigation
very
often
to
have
purchased
the
stock
long
after
all
of
this
takes
place,
so
the
lawyer
who
wants
to
bring
this
suit
can
just
go
out
and
find
somebody
who
knows
nothing?
isn't
that
right?
