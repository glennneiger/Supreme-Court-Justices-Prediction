justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
we
said
in
merck.
i
mean,
wasn't
merck
just
like
that?
it
says
a
cause
of
action
can
be
or
whatever
--
it
may
not
be
brought
--
may
be
brought
not
later
than
the
earlier
of
2
years
after
the
discovery
of
the
facts
or
5
years
after
the
violation.
i
take
it
that
means
5
years
after
the
violation.
forget
about
the
discovery
of
the
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
two
different
doctrines,
i
gather.
one
is
equitable
--
equitable
tolling.
the
other
is
sometimes
called
equitable
estoppel
or
fraudulent
concealment.
but
whatever
you
call
them,
if
you
take
your
position,
a
person
who
really
thinks
he
doesn't
have
to
file
and
so
he
doesn't
file
will
be
liable
forever,
there
will
be
no
statute
of
limitations
because
the
plaintiff
will
never
find
out.
maybe
50
years
later,
all
right.
if
you
take
the
opposite
position,
then
you
will
prevent
plaintiffs
in
borderline
cases
from
bringing
suits
because
they
aren't
going
to
find
out
if
somebody
thinks
it's
a
borderline
case.
i
see
one
harm
one
way,
one
harm
the
other
way.
you
are
arguing
that
the
second
harm
is
the
worst
harm.
okay,
why?
what's
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
making
it
for
you
--
i'm
making
your
argument
or
i'm
trying
to.
[laughter]
i'm
saying
it's
something
on
your
side
and
something
on
the
other
side.
if
he's
arguing
it,
you
are
wrong.
because
if
there
is
no
bad
conduct
by
the
defendant,
he
honestly
thinks
he
doesn't
have
to
file,
then
the
statute
never
runs.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
on
the
other
hand
his
position
leads
to
the
plaintiff
never
being
able
to
sue
in
borderline
cases.
which
is
worse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it's
worked
out,
but
i
don't
understand
it.
i
mean,
why
not
just
treat
it
you
like
a
special
--
regular
statute
of
limitations?
say
that
the
profit
is
made
on
day
1.
it
was
made
by
an
insider,
and
if
your
client
finds
out
about
it
or
reasonably
should
find
out
about
it,
then
the
statute
begins
to
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
otherwise
it's
tolled,
period.
simple,
same
as
every
other
statute.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
people,
you
see,
who
don't
know.
there
are
always
borderline
cases,
some
people,
whether
it's
this
one
or
not,
think
maybe
they
don't
have
to
file.
they
think
they
are
outside
the
statute.
so
they
don't.
okay?
you
are
protected.
if
they
don't
file,
and
you
wouldn't
reasonably
find
out
about
it,
fine.
but
when
you
find
out
about
it
or
should
have,
not
fine.
it's
very
simple,
and
makes
everything
logical.
it
seems
to
be
fair
to
your
client,
certainly.
