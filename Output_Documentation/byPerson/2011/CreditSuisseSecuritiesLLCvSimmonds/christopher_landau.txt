mr.
christopher
landau
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
16(b)
of
the
1934
exchange
act,
congress
created
a
cause
of
action
to
allow
securities
issuers
to
recover
short-swing
profits
from
certain
covered
persons,
but
specified
that
a
lawsuit
must
be
brought
2
years
after
the
date
the
short-swing
profit
was
realized.
the
statute
doesn't
say
2
years
after
the
date
the
defendants
filed
a
section
16(a)
report,
as
the
ninth
circuit
and
respondents
would
like
to
have
it.
nor
does
the
statute
say
2
years
after
the
date
the
plaintiff
discovers
the
short-swing
transaction,
as
the
government
would
like
to
rewrite
it.
i
would
like
to
make
two
basic
points
here
today.
first,
as
this
court
recognized
in
lampf,
the
2-year
time
limit
in
section
16(b)
is
best
read
as
a
period
of
repose
that
can't
be
extended
at
all;
and
second,
even
if
section
16(b)'s
2-year
time
limit
could
be
extended,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
tolling
wouldn't
apply
to
extend
the
time
limit
here,
where
the
plaintiff
didn't
act
diligently
to
bring
a
claim
and
didn't
prove
that
any
extraordinary
circumstances
precluded
her
from
filing.
the
upshot
of
these
two
points
is
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
and
remand
the
case
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
untimely.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
with
respect,
it's
certainly
true
that
a
two-pronged
time
limit
underscores
that
the
outer
prong
is
a
period
of
repose,
but
there
are
certainly
no
magic
words
that
congress
has
to
use.
it
doesn't
have
to
use
a
two-pronged
time
limit
to
--
to
establish
the
outer
limit
as
a
period
of
repose.
in
fact,
that's
really
the
lesson
of
this
court's
decision
in
trw
and
in
beggerly
and
brockamp,
that
the
--
the
background
or
the
default
rule,
the
background
rule
that
equitable
tolling
applies,
isn't
some
kind
--
is
just
that.
it's
a
background
rule.
and
congress
in
the
text
or
structure--
mr.
christopher
landau
--sure,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--the
key
point,
your
honor,
is
that
this
congress
in
the
1934
exchange
act
was
carefully
attuned
to
the
issue
of
time
limits.
congress
--
there
was
--
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
of
this.
this
is
a
not
a
situation
where
congress
established
a
liability
and
just
didn't
focus
on
this
issue,
as
often
happens,
and
left
it
to
background
statute
of
limitations
provisions
of
other
background
rules.
congress
thought
long
and
hard
about
this.
with
respect
to
the
two-prong
provisions,
those
are
the
fraud
provisions
that
were
set
at
an
outer
limit
of
3
years.
and
then
they
actually
created
a
discovery
rule
that
said:
we
don't
even
want
people
to
wait
the
whole
3
years;
if
they
discover
the
facts
underlying
their
claim,
we
want
them
to
bring
it
within
a
year.
so
they
used
discovery
to
shorten
the
time,
not
to
extend
it.
mr.
christopher
landau
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
i
would
like
to
just
finish
on
the
structural
point;
and
we
also
have
a
textual
argument.
with
respect
to
the
structure,
this,
let's
not
forget,
was
enacted
at
the
same
time
and
as
part
of
the
same
statute
as
these
other
provisions
that
did
use
discovery
provisions
to
shorten
the
time
limit.
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
16(b),
instead
of
having
the
3-year
outer
limit
plus
a
safety
valve
that
would
make
you
have
to
sue
even
sooner,
congress
has
brought
in
the
outer
limit.
but
--
instead
of
3
years
as
in
the
2-prong
provisions,
said
you
have
got
to
sue
within
2
years.
having
said
you
have
got
to
sue
within
2
years,
they
decided
you
didn't
need
that
safety
valve
provision.
but
it
would
be
very--
mr.
christopher
landau
--two
things,
your
honor.
this
legislation
--
again,
this
section
16
is
not
a
standalone
statute.
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
'34
act.
and
so
i
think
--
the
same
congress
that
set
a
hard
outer
limit
of
repose
for
fraud
claims
in
section
9(e)
and
18(c)
wouldn't
have
wanted
with
respect
to
this
prophylactic
provision
that
it
is,
by
definition,
both
under
and
over-inclusive.
it
may
be--
mr.
christopher
landau
--again,
your
honor,
i
think
one
point,
just
to
respond
to
that,
and
as
well
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
the
--
the
typical
textual
hook
for
a
statute
of
repose
is
that
it's
keyed
off
of
the
defendant's
conduct
--
2
years
after
the
defendant
does
x,
y,
or
z.
that
is
as
we
quoted
black's
law
dictionary
for
this
proposition
in
our
brief.
the
seventh
circuit,
justice
posner,
had
an
opinion
just
last
week
underscoring
this
point,
the
hy-vee
case,
that
said
the
typical
statute
of
limitations
actually
says
2
years
after
the
cause
of
action
accrued
or
after
the
plaintiff
discovered,
but
when
you're
--
when
--
again,
we
don't
think
--
in
this
case
we
are
not
relying
solely
on
the
textual
thing,
but
in
terms
of
numbers
of
guideposts
this
is
not
your
classic
statute
of
limitation.
if
you
actually
start
looking
at
them,
a
lot
of
them
key
off
of
accrual.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
i
think
we
can't
say
that
there
is
a
bright-line
rule.
congress
--
again,
i
think
the
most
we
can
say
is
that
the
classic
formulation
of
a
statute
of
repose
is
to
key
a
time
limit
off
of
the
defendant's
conduct
as
opposed
to
the
accrual.
and
again--
mr.
christopher
landau
--clearly
to
the--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
your
honor,
again,
one
of
the
things
about
this
statute
that
is
kind
of
odd,
it's
a
prophylactic
statute
that
doesn't
even
require
any
injury.
i
mean,
it
just
says
there
has
got
to
be
disgorgement
to
the
corporation.
it's
a
little
bit
different--
mr.
christopher
landau
--but
it's
taking
it
away
from
the
defendant.
it
doesn't
actually
mean
that
actually
somebody
else
would
have
earned
that
money.
mr.
christopher
landau
i
think--
mr.
christopher
landau
--i
think
the
key
point,
your
honor,
is
to
look
at
the
1934
exchange
act
as
a
whole,
which
includes
not
only
this
provision
but
also
out-and-out
fraud
provisions
that
are
for
intentional,
real
hard-core
insider
trading.
that
would
be
sections
9(e)
and
18(c).
there
is
no
question
that
congress
provided
a
period
of
repose
for
those,
the
outer
limit.
and
then
that
raises
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
started
with,
which
is,
do
you
have
to
have
a
two-prong
limit?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
you
don't.
there
is
no
magic
words,
as
trw,
beggerly
and
brockamp
show
us.
you
just
have
to
try
to
make
sense
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
and
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
give
repose
to
intentional
fraudsters
but
not
give
repose
to
a
defendant
in
a
purely
prophylactic
section
16(b)
action.
i
think
that's
the
fundamental
thing
when
you
just
step
back
and
look
at
this.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
for
the
same
reason
that
congress
would
have
afforded
repose
even
to
out
and
out
fraudsters.
again,
congress
was
creating
vast
new
liability
here.
a
fraudster
by
definition,
as
somebody
who
would
be
liable
under
18(c)
or
9(e),
has
done
kind
of
to
conceal
it.
yet
congress
still
believed,
because
it
was
creating
this
vast
new
liability.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
like
many
of
judge
posner's
theories,
it's
--
it's
a
very
clever
theory.
but
in
a
sense,
it
misses
the
fundamental
truth
that
when
congress
is
granting
repose
it
is
trying
to
allow
people
to
turn
the
page
on
something
in
their
past.
the
idea
that
congress
would
grant
repose
to
more
culpable
people
but
not
to
less
culpable
people--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
again,
the
only
thing
i
will
say
on
repose
before
--
and
i
would
like
to
turn
then,
because
we
certainly
don't
need
repose
to
win
this
case,
and
--
and
while
we
think
it
is
best
characterized,
this
court
in
lampf
had
occasion
to
look
at
all
of
the,
the
various
time
limits
and
see
how
they
all
worked
together.
and
this
court
characterized
section
16(b)
as
a
statute
of
repose.
to
be
sure,
that
was
dicta
because
lampf,
itself
was
not
a
16(b)
case.
but
it
was
--
it
was
--
it
was
a
statement
or
it
was
a
recognition
that
came
after
looking
at
all
of
these,
and
it
would
be
strange
now
to
say
that,
in
fact,
the
16(b)
time
period
is
potentially
--
the
court
said
it
was
more
restrictive,
and
both
the
majority
and
justice
kennedy
in
dissent
agreed
that
it
was
a
statute
of
repose.
mr.
christopher
landau
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
[laughter]
lampf
stands
as
a
landmark.
but
--
but
let
me
make
clear,
your
honor.
our
position
here
today
doesn't
depend
on
this
being
a
statute
of
repose,
because
even
if
this
2-year
time
limit--
mr.
christopher
landau
--absolutely.
mr.
christopher
landau
your
honor,
they
can
find
out
in
many
ways,
the
same
ways
that
any
other
securities
plaintiff,
including
a
fraud
securities
plaintiff,
can
find
out.
there
are
corporate
books
and
records
that
can
be
examined.
there
are
other
sec
filings
and
sec
investigations.
there
is
other
litigation.
this
could
come
up
in
an
estate
discovery
--
estate
or
divorce
proceedings.
there
are
whistle
blowers,
confidential
informers,
brokers,
counterparts
--
counterparties.
again,
if
congress
had
wanted
the
section
16(a)
disclosure
to
be
the
trigger
under
section
16(b),
it
could
have
done
so.
and
in
fact,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
there
was
an
early
draft
in
the
house
that
created
a
two-prong
provision
and
established
for
--
you
know,
it's
an
outer
limit
of
3
years
and
an
inner
limit
of
6
months
after
the
16(a)
disclosure.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
again,
like
--
this
case
is
a
good
example.
in
this
very
case,
the
contradiction
at
the
heart
of
the
plaintiff's
case
is
that
they
say,
well,
it
can't
possibly
be
discovered
without
a
16(a)
filing.
there
was
no
section
16(a)
filing.
to
this
day,
they
say
the
statute
of
limitation
has
not
started
to
run.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
--
there
is
not
a
form
4,
which
is
a
public
document.
but
not
every
securities
filing
requires
a
public
document.
in--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
again,
there
may
be
sec
filings.
there
are--
mr.
christopher
landau
--well,
no,
there
--
there
are
sec
filings
that
companies
are
required
to
make.
there
are
--
again,
this
is
not
a
--
a
--
selling
--
buying
and
selling
shares
is
not
something
that
can
be
done
alone
in
the
dark
of
night.
you
need
to
have
other
people
involved
with
you.
you
need
to
have
brokers
complicit.
you
--
it
is
a
large
amount
of
shares.
the
counterparties.
mr.
christopher
landau
there
are
whistle
blowers.
that's
the
--
that's
the--
mr.
christopher
landau
--your
honor,
brokers
have
their
own
responsibilities.
a
broker
could
be
held
liable
as
an
aider
or
abettor
to
a
violation.
mr.
christopher
landau
well,
again,
the
--
the
broker
may
get
suspicious
if
the
--
a
broker
may
actually
be
checking.
if
a
--
if
a
--
if
a
ceo
of
a
corporation
is
suddenly
selling
all
these
things
--
again,
this
is
no
different
than
the
way
a
securities
plaintiff
in
an
out
and
out
fraud
case
--
and
those
are
brought
every
day,
your
honor.
but
again,
i
think
the
point
here
is
that,
regardless
of
whether
this
is
repose,
even
if
you
say
that
this
can
be
extended,
it's
certainly
can't
be
extended
in
the
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
extended
it.
and
we
and
the
sec,
the
government,
agree
on
this:
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
this
absolute
black
letter
rule
that
says,
it
is
tolled
--
it
doesn't
even
start
to
run
unless
and
until
the
section
16(a)
report
is
filed.
mr.
christopher
landau
the
second
circuit
rule
is
more
of
a
notice
approach
that
says
that
it
--
but
again,
your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
second
circuit's
approach
is
that
it
doesn't
reflect
traditional
background
norms
of
equitable
tolling.
then
if
you
say
it's
not
a
statute
of
repose,
then
what
do
you
do
just
to
figure
out
what
congress
would
have
wanted?
you
say
congress
legislates
against
the
--
the
--
the
backdrop
of
these
kind
of
equitable
doctrines.
o
let's
look
at
what
equitable
tolling
consists
of.
this
court
in
many
cases
over
the
years
--
it's
been
dealing
with
equitable
tolling
since
almost
the
first
days
of
the
court,
well
into
the
19th
century.
in
the
most
recent
cases,
the
court
has
made
clear,
in
the
holland
case,
for
instance,
just
two
terms
ago,
that
equitable
tolling
traditionally
has
two
minimum
requirements.
first,
there
has
to
be
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff.
and
in
this
context
that
means
does
a
reasonable
--
did
the
plaintiff
know
or
would
a
reasonably
diligent
shareholder
have
reason
to
know
of
the
claim;
and
second,
extraordinary
circumstances.
and
so,
with
respect
to
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
litzler,
your
honor,
that
you
mentioned,
i
think
it
departs
from
traditional
equitable
tolling
in
--
in
a
couple
of
ways.
most
particularly
it
limits
it
to
actual
knowledge.
it
doesn't
say
"know
or
should
have
known",
which
again
is
the
background
rule,
as
we
and
the
government
agree.
the
second
thing
with
respect
to
litzler
where
it
departs
from
the
background
rule
is
it
says
that
it
is
--
per
se
gives
rise
to
equitable
tolling
not
to
file
the
section
16(a)
and
doesn't
include
any
kind
of
culpability
on
the
defendant's
part.
and
judge
jacobs,
in
footnote
5
of
litzler,
dropped
a
footnote
saying
that
he
would
prefer
to
announce
a
tolling
rule
that
was
more
consonant
with,
again,
background
rules
of
equitable
tolling,
that
said
only
when
the
failure
to
file
the
section
16(a)
was
unreasonable
or
--
or
intentional,
because
he
could
say
otherwise
you
could
have
a
purely
technical
or
inadvertent
violation
that
would
give
rise
potentially
to
equitable
tolling,
and
he
didn't
think
that
was
right.
mr.
christopher
landau
our
best
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
already
decided
the
very
issue
here.
the
district
court
said
it
is
undisputed,
just
on
the
pleadings,
that
--
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known.
this
case
is
probably
the
most
egregious
kind
of
case
that
you
can
see
for
this
proposition,
because
everything
here
is
a
replay
of
the
ipo
litigation
and
even
the
billing
case
that
came
all
the
way
to
this
court.
this
case
was
filed
just
a
few
months
after
this
court
decided
billing.
and
in
particular
--
they
have
now
--
the
respondents
have
come
and
said:
well,
what
we
didn't
know
here
was
group,
and
we
didn't
know
that
the
--
the
underwriters
were
in
a
conspiracy
with
the
issuer
insiders,
and
that
was
the
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
we
were
missing.
and--
mr.
christopher
landau
--correct,
your
honor,
but
you
are
entitled,
in
deciding
that,
to
look
at
their
own
pleadings.
and
there
is
two
important
things
from
their
own
pleadings.
first,
if
you
look
at
their
complaint,
it's
--
it
alleges
lock-up
as
its
theory
of
group.
it
says
the
plaintiffs
and
the
--
the
underwriters
and
the
issuer
insiders
formed
a
16(a)
group
because
they
had
these
lock-up
agreements.
well,
those
lock-up
agreements
were
publicly
known
as
early
as
the
prospectus
of
these
ipos,
so
the
--
the
lock-up
agreement
was
no
secret.
second,
they
say,
well,
we
--
even
though
lock-up
might
have
been
out
there,
we
didn't
know
there
was
an
underpricing-based
conspiracy.
and
even
assuming
they
could
try
and
slice
and
dice
it
like
that
according
to
the
--
the
legal
theory,
the
fact
is
in
their
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court,
they
cited
--
this
is
docket
58
in
the
district
court,
pages
1
to
2
--
they
--
they
go
at
length
about
the
academic
literature
regarding
a
conspiracy
between
underwriters
and
issuer
insiders
that
they
say
gives
legitimacy
to
their
substantive
claim.
but
that
includes
lots
of
articles,
including
a
2004
article
--
again,
2005
would
be
2
years
before
they
filed.
so
they
are
relying
in
their
opposition
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
an
article
--
there
is
a
lengthy
footnote
that
says
there
is
a
ton
of
academic
research
on
this
particular
theory.
so
basically,
a
remand
is
unnecessary
because
the
--
the
pleaded
facts
by
the
plaintiff
themselves
show
this
is
untimely
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
there's
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
mr.
christopher
landau
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
briefly,
just
on
repose,
two
quick
points.
if
there
is
any
one
theme
that
runs
through
this
court's
16(b)
jurisprudence,
it's
that
precisely
because
the
--
section
16(b)
is
prophylactic,
it
should
be
interpreted
in
a
literal
and
mechanical
way.
i
think
the
--
that
argues
for
repose,
because
you
don't
get
into
a
lot
of
these
questions
about
who
knew
what
when.
and,
so,
that
certainly
would
be
consistent
with
--
this
case
would
fit
well
within
that
--
that
tradition,
if
you
were
to
go
that
way.
in
addition
on
repose,
let's
not
forget
that
congress
gave
2
years
after
the
date
the
profits
were
realized.
if
those
profits
were
in
a
report,
you
wouldn't
need
the
whole
2
years,
anyway.
in
fact,
for
the
fraud
provision,
you
only
get
1
year
after
you
discover
it.
so
in
a
sense,
i
think
that
helps
show
that
even
in
a
repose
approach,
2
years
is
plenty
of
time.
then
--
but
assuming
that
you
go
with
equitable
tolling,
i
think
--
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
there
is
really
four
approaches
that
have
been
brought
forth.
there's
the
ninth
circuit's
rigid
approach
that
it
--
they
call
it
equitable
tolling,
but
there's
really
nothing
equitable
about
it.
it's
--
it's
we
don't
care
about
who
knew
what,
when
or
anything.
it
is
you
have
to
file
the
16(a).
the
district
court
actually
struggled,
because
the
district
court
in
this
case
said
i'm
supposed
to
be
doing
something
called
equitable
tolling,
and
there's
nothing
equitable
here
at
all,
because
i
think
everything
here
was
plainly
known
to
the
--
to
the
plaintiffs
or
should
have
been
known.
then
you
have
the
litzler
approach,
which
looks
to
actual
knowledge.
and
i
think
as
some
of
the
questioning
brought
out,
there
is
no
background
rule
that
distinguishes
between
actual
knowledge
and
constructive
knowledge
for
purposes
of
equitable
tolling.
again,
i
think
as
some
of
the
questions
brought
out,
equitable
tolling,
because
it
is
an
equitable
doctrine,
looks
to
has
the
defendant
behaved
equitably
and
has
the
plaintiff
behaved
equitably?
we
agree
with
the
government,
that
diligence,
in
other
words,
would
a
reasonable
shareholder
--
did
a
reasonable
shareholder
know
or
would
a
reasonable
shareholder
should
have
known
is
a
critical
part
of
the
inquiry
that's
missing
in
--
in
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis.
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
is
with
respect
to
their
--
their
view
of
fraudulent
concealment
to
involve
any
violation
--
any
alleged
violation
of
a
statutory
16(a)
duty.
under
the
government's
view,
it
would
be
considered
fraudulent
concealment
and
would
--
we
give
rise
to
tolling.
if
somebody
were
to
come
in
today
and
say,
gee,
the
microsoft
ipo
back
in
1986,
there
was
actually
a
group
in
there,
the
underwriters
conspired,
and
--
you
know,
the
thing
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
that
one
is
this
case
happens
to
have
involved
this
hugely
prominent
ipo
litigation
that
really
brought
all
these
things
to
light,
but
the
--
the
defendant
in
that
microsoft
hypothetical
would
not
have
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
point
to
the
defendant's
--
the
plaintiffs'
lack
of
diligence
saying
this
is
all
out
there.
so,
you
would
be
creating
a
regime,
if
you
go
with
the
government's
approach
that
really
waters
down
the
defendant's
culpability
on
the
fraudulent
concealment
side
of
equitable
tolling,
essentially
they
are
asking
you
to
take
the
fraud
out
of
fraudulent
concealment.
the
only
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
with
respect
to
the
specific
facts
here
again,
counsel
said
today
that
this
was
not
known
until
a
harvard
symposium
in
2009.
i
would
urge
you,
again,
to
look
at
their
briefing
below,
their
docket
58
in
the
district
court
responds
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
by
citing
a
2004
article,
that
they
actually
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
you
can
look
at
joint
appendix
80
to
83,
their
theory
of
underwriter
conspiracy
with
issuer
insiders
is
set
forth
right
there
on
those
pages
of
that
2004
article,
well
before
the
2
years.
and
again
in
addition,
the
2000
--
their
complaint,
which
talks
about
lock-up,
you
can
look
specifically
at
joint
appendix
59
to
61
to
see
how
lock-up
was
alleged
to
be
a
critical
part
of
their
underlying
theory.
finally,
it
is
not
true
again
that
the
ipo
litigation
was
only
about
underwriters.
there
were
individual
issuer
defendants
at
issue
in
the
ipo
litigation.
and,
in
fact,
judge
scheindlin's
opinion
goes
into
some
detail
about
the
--
the
alleged
conspiracy
that
they
are
saying
--
the
alleged
group
that
they
are
saying
they
couldn't
have
found
out.
in
fact,
she
says
--
this
at
pages
356
and
358
of
the
judge
scheindlin
opinion,
we
will
provide
quotations
that
show
that
their
theory
was
very
well
known.
thank
you.
