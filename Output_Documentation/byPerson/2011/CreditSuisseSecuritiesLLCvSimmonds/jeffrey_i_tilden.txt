mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
justice
scalia,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
underwriters
argument
and
the
government's
for
that
matter
are
founded
on
the
notion
that
congress
wanted
someone
who
violated
16a
to
receive
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
or
repose
in
16b.
16b
is
unique
in
the
securities
law
and
perhaps
in
the
law
generally,
in
that
the
plaintiff
suffers
no
injury
and
recovers
no
damages.
there
is
no
triggering
event,
unlike
a
fraud
case,
their
stock
drops,
to
suggest
that
you
have
been
harmed.
16b
is
99
%
of
the
time
irrelevant
without
a
16a
filing.
as
a
matter
of
logic,
it
makes
no
sense
to
provide
the
one
who
violates
16b
an
escape
liability
because
they
also
violate
16a.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
we
get
here
--
get
there
this
way,
your
honor.
the
court
several
times
recognized
that
16b
and
16a
were
interrelated.
the
limitations
period
indeed
provides,
in
the
second
sentence
"such
profit
and
no
such
suit
for
such
profit.
"
well,
what
profit
and
what
suit
are
those?
to
answer
that
question
we
must
go
to
the
first
sentence
which
refers
to
the
profit
of
such
beneficial
owner,
director
and
officer.
who
are
they?
to
know
that
we
must
go
to
16a
which
is
a
single
sentence
statutory
command
that
directs
"beneficial
owners
of
more
than
10
%,
directors
and
officers
to
file
the
form
provided
for
below.
"
16b
is
a
statute
of
limitations
for
those
who
file
the
form.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
in
16b
for
those
who
do
not.
the
statute
of
repose
contended
for
by
the
underwriters
here
would
have
this
unique
feature:
it
would
run
invisibly
to
all
but
the
defendant.
no
one
else
has
any
notice,
the
clock
is
ticking,
but
the
the
defendant.
this
has
a
--
an
attractiveness
if
you
are
the
defendant,
but
it
doesn't
work
well
for
the
rest
of
us.
no
knowledge
of
a
triggering
event
and
its
running
in
the
face
of
an
affirmative
statutory
duty.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
your
honor,
the
--
there
are
several
responses
to
that.
16a
we
believe
is
the
discovery
rule.
congress
looked
at
this
and
commanded
insiders
to
put
the
information
in
a
particular
location,
so
that
shareholders
who
have
the
primary
enforcement
authority
under
16b
can
go
find
it
there.
in
the
face
of
that
congressional
dictate,
can
we
graft
an
appendage
on
to
the
statute
that
says
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
shareholder
was
told
that
he
or
she
could
go
look
there
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
went
to
look
there
and
there
was
nothing
there,
they
must
nonetheless
go
elsewhere.
congress
said
shareholder,
go
look
behind
door
number
16
to
see
if
the
information
is
there.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
no,
sir,
you
are
not
right.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
we
alleged
in
the
claim
a
--
a
conscious
agreement
between
the
underwriters
and
key
decisionmakers
at
the
issuer
underpriced
the
ipo.
this
is
extraordinarily
counterintuitive
behavior.
it
is
not
listed
or
mentioned
at
all
in
the
ipo
filing
in
'02.
judge
scheindlin's
opinion
in
'03
nowhere
refers
to
group,
agreement,
contract,
conspiracy.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
a
group
plainly
is.
a
group
is.
it's
a
footnote,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
the
premise,
but
let
me
work
backwards.
first,
if
we
were
to
apply
a
vanilla
form
discovery
rule
like
merck,
knowledge
of
the
particular
facts
of
the
transaction,
to
this
day
no
one
has
knowledge
of
the
purchase
and
sales
within
six
months
and
the
profits.
those
are
elements
of
a
16
--
i'm
sorry
a
16b
claim,
we
lack
knowledge.
two,
whatever
it
is
a
reasonable
shareholder
ought
to
do
to
trigger
a
merck-like
plain
vanilla
discovery
rule,
we
have
gone
far
beyond
that.
we
cannot
impose
on
a
shareholder
the
obligation
to
read
the
journal
of
financial
management
or
to
follow
a
harvard
symposium.
three
--
and
this--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--your
honor,
this
is
a
--
not
a
garden
variety
16b
violation.
i
agree
with
you
completely
regarding
our
level
of
involvement,
but
i
do
not
believe
we
present
a
standard
16b
claim.
but
to
answer
directly
your
question,
the
group
allegation
that
underwriters
and
key
decisionmakers
of
the
issuer
conspired
together
is
not
in
the
ipo
case.
the
allegation
there
was
this:
that
the
underwriters
were
getting
unrevealed
compensation
that
should
have
been
disclosed.
should
have
been
disclosed
and
was
not.
underwriter
compensation
and
the
allegation
against
the
insiders
was
that
they
knowingly
or
recklessly
signed
the
prospectus.
it's
page,
i
believe,
310
of
judge
scheindlin's
opinion.
so
that
is
all
that
is
alleged
there.
there
is
no
group
activity,
no
notion
that
this
acted
in
concert
or
that
they
were
acting
in
concert.
the
notion
that
someone
would
deliberately
underprice
their
ipo
first
appeared
in
the
scholarly
research
at
a
spring
of
'09
harvard
symposium
a
year
and
a
half
after
we
filed
our
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
the
fraud
case
is
all
about
--
involve,
your
honor,
someone
who
has
reason
to
know
that
they
have
been
defrauded.
it
may
only
be
that
they
bought
their
stock
of
x,
and
now,
it's
selling
for
half
of
x,
but
they
know
something
has
happened.
there
is
no
injury
here.
the
16b
plaintiff
has
suffered
no
injury.
it's
critical
to
an
understanding
of
what
the
congress
contemplated
at
the
time.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
i
don't
believe,
your
honor
--
the
1934
legislative
history
made
it
clear
--
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
extraordinarily
concerned
about
a
broad
sweep
of
misconduct
in
the
'20s.
they
intended
a
rule
that
in
this
court's
language
in
reliance
electric
would
be
flat,
sweeping,
and
arbitrary.
they
intended
to
squeeze
every
penny
of
profit
out
of
these
transactions,
and
they
did
so
in
16(b).
this
is
not
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
congress
has
said
you
cannot
be
unwary.
if
you
are
an
insider,
you
must
be
wary.
you
must
be
wary.
that's
what
congress
has
said.
if
we
are
concerned
about
how
this
might
work
going
forward,
and
the
underwriters
have
raised
a
parade
of
horribles
--
"oh,
this
is
what
will
happen
if
the
court
adopts
our
position.
"
--one
thing
we
might
do
if
we
want
to
know
what
will
occur
in
the
next
64
or
77
years
is
look
backwards
at
the
last
64
or
77
years.
the
whittaker
rule
has
been
the
rule
in
most
of
the
united
states
for
virtually
the
entirety
of
the
last
77
years.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--well,
we
don't
believe
the
congressional
design
contemplated
tolling.
congress
told
shareholders
we
could
go
look
in
a
particular
place.
but
here's
one
other
problem
with
it.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
it
may
be
simple
and
fair,
your
honor.
we
--
we
don't
believe
it's
what
the
language
of
the
statute
provides
for.
it
also
suffers
from
this
additional
defect:
under
the
statute
in
this
court's
opinion
in
gollust
v.
mendell,
the
standing
requirement
for
16(b)
is
that
you
own
shares
at
the
time
of
institution
of
the
action.
this
can
be
years
subsequent
to
the
events
themselves.
can
we
adopt
a
statute
of
limitation,
a
discovery
rule
that
runs
against
someone
who
has
not
yet
required
standing
under
gollust?
i
wonder
if
we
can.
it
seems
to
me
to
defeat
the
special
standing
that
congress
intended
16(b)
shareholders
to
have.
you
acquire
standing
on
day
700
when
you
purchase
your
shares,
only
to
find
that
you
have
no
claim
because
you
were
having
imputed
to
you
something
that
a
shareholder,
which
you
were
not,
knew
or
should
have
known
3
years
earlier.
could
that
be--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--i
cannot
--
i
cannot,
your
honor,
but
i
can
also
not
point
to
a
statute
of
limitations
such
as
this
one
that
follows
immediately
on
an
affirmative
disclosure
obligation
imposed
on
the
defendant.
to
answer
a
question
justice
alito
raised
in
response
to
one
of
my
colleagues,
i
believe
the
best
analysis
of
the
difference
between
a
statute
of
limitations
and
a
statute
of
repose
by
this
court
recently
is
in
the
beach
v.
ocwen
opinion.
and
in
beach
the
court
analyzed
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
concluded
the
language
that
said
3
years
after
the
transaction
the
right
of
rescission
shall
cease,
was
the
statute
of
repose.
it
was
completely
clear.
it
did
not
rely
on
a
discovery
rule
incorporated
therein;
it
did
not
require
a
--
did
not
rely
on
a
second
prong.
beach
cites
the
--
a
prominent
harvard
law
review
article
at
63,
harvard
law
review,
and
is
a
wonderful
analysis
of
this
court's
work
on
this
subject.
a
kernel
of
the
motivation
in
the
underwriters'
briefing
is
the
notion
that
liability
under
16(b)
is
draconian,
that
they're
--
that
it's
harsh.
it's
important
to
note
that
all
you
have
to
do
under
16(b)
is
give
back
profit
that
never
belonged
to
you.
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
it
inured
to
the
corporation;
you
weren't
entitled
to
it.
it's
as
if
the
penalty
for
bank
robbery
were
that
you
merely
had
to
give
the
money
back.
no
attorneys'
fees,
you
don't
have
to
return
your
principal,
you
just
give
the
money
back.
finally
i
would
like
to
address
a
difference
between
the
whittaker
decision
and
the
litzler
decision,
briefly.
both
of
these
courts
found
that
16(b)
only
worked
by
virtue
of
16(a).
in
whittaker
the
ninth
circuit
said
only
by
full
compliance
with
16(a)
do
your
16(b)
rights
mean
anything;
and
in
litzler
the
second
circuit
said
16(b)
only
works
because
of
the
absolute
duty
of
disclosure
placed
on
the
defendant.
we
agree
with
that.
we
disagree
with
my
buddy,
mr.
landau.
most
trading
today
occurs
electronically
in
the
dark
of
night;
it
is
invisible
to
everyone
else.
but
if
the
court
gets
to
the
position
where
it
is
debating
whether
whittaker
or
litzler
ought
to
be
the
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--or
the
sg's,
we
would
offer
this:
there
is
no
reported
decision
in
which
whittaker
and
litzler
will
yield
different
results
in
our
view.
whittaker
is
a
bright-line
rule
of
the
kind
congress
intended.
litzler
is
a
rule
that
in
its
own
words
requires
"conceivably
discovery
and
trial".
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
we
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--the
--
there
is
much
i
want
to
say
in
response
to
that.
the
underwriters
contended
in
the
lower
courts
for
a
subjective
rule.
no
party
before
this
court
contends
for
a
subjective
rule.
we
do
not
believe
that
--
whittaker
is
not
a
subjective
rule,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
judge
jacobs
in
litzler
was
arguing
for
a
subjective
rule.
what
he
envisioned
--
he
--
the
judge
had
a
fair
concern
in
the
abstract.
he
said
look,
if
they
don't
file
the
form
but
the
identical
information
is
available
to
all
the
world
everywhere
else,
what's
wrong
with
that?
well,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it,
except
that
it's
never
available
to
all
the
world
anywhere
else.
no
other
securities
filings
reveal
this.
congress
told
us
to
go
look
in
one
place,
and
not
anywhere
else.
but
the
litzler
court
i
don't
think
envisioned
an
actual
notice
rule.
when
it
said
information
as
clear
as
2
plus
2,
i
believe
it
was
seeking
an
objective
rule,
whittaker-like,
looking
for
whittaker
acquittal
and
information.
we
don't
believe
such
a
thing
exists.
that
said,
the
litzler
rule
requires
discovery
in
trial.
if
the
rules
don't
achieve
different
results,
then
we
have
the
choice
between
applying
a
rule
that
is
just
speedy
and
efficient
--
whittaker,
and
a
rule
that
a
just,
slow
and
costly
--
litzler.
some
version
of
ockham's
razor,
if
nothing
else,
ought
to
support
the
application
of
the
whittaker
rule
and
not
the
litzler
should
the
court
find
itself
in
that
position.
here's
the
last
thing
i'd
say
and
then
i
will
be
quiet.
today
is
the
first
time
this
court
has
analyzed
the
issue
before
it,
but
it's
come
up
repeatedly
in
the
lower
courts
over
the
last
77
years
and
with
one
exception,
1954
in
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania,
the
courts
have
unanimously
rejected
the
petition
--
the
position
contended
for
by
both
the
underwriters
here
and
the
government.
the
rule
has
been
whittaker
or
a
litzler
variant
of
it
everywhere,
all
the
time.
in
1934
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
stock
required
the
actual
knowledge
of
some
other
people.
today
it
is
an
impersonal
electronic
transaction,
often
at
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
invisible
to
everyone.
insider
trading
was
hard
enough
to
uncover
then,
it's
gotten
harder
now.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
envisioned
that
any
additional
burden
would
be
placed
on
a
shareholder
by
forcing
to
learn
this
undetectable
conduct
within
2
years.
the
most,
in
our
view,
famous
pronouncement
by
this
court
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
16(b)
is
out
of
the
reliance
electric
opinion
in
1962.
in
reliance
the
court
said,
faced
with
a
question,
two
competing
interpretations
of
the
statute,
the
court
should
--
should
select
that
interpretation
that
best
serves
the
congressional
purpose
of
curbing
short-swing
speculation
by
insiders.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
i
grant
you
it
could
have
said
otherwise,
your
honor,
but
we--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
tilden
--every
other
statute
of
limitations
we
can
think
of,
your
honor,
involves
a
plaintiff
who
has
reason
to
know
of
some
harm,
and
incidentally,
where
it
covers
damages.
16(b)
plaintiff
has
no
reason
to
know
of
harm
and
recovers
no
damages.
right?
if
i
--
let's
take
a
case
that
is
seen
every
day
and
every
month,
probably
in
every
state
in
the
country.
a
lawnmower
accident
and
a
child
or
a
teenager
loses
a
toe.
you
may
not
know
anything
about
lawnmower
design.
you
may
not
know
anything
about
your
state's
product
liability
act
or
ansi
standards
or
the
litany
of
breach,
causation
and
damages,
but
you
do
know
that
you
used
to
have
ten
toes
and
now
you
have
nine.
there
is
no
equivalent.
the
16(b)
plaintiff
does
not
know
insider
trading
has
occurred
and
won't
know
unless
he
or
she
is
told.
they
do
not
know
someone
else
somewhere
has
nine
toes.
as
far
as
they
know
everybody
still
has
all
of
their
toes.
no
other
statute
of
limitations
will
serve
as
an
analog
here
because
of
the
unique
character
of
16(b).
the
plaintiff
has
no
injury
and
recovers
no
damages.
we
don't
believe
we
can
fairly
look
at
other
statutes
of
limitation
as
a
model
given
that
distinction.
the
reliance
electric
court
concluded
if
--
if
you
have
a
choice,
you
should
select
that
interpretation
that
best
serves
the
goal
of
short-swing
trading
by
insiders.
we
believe
the
--
the
case
before
the
court
can
