justice
antonin
scalia
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
number
10-1261,
credit
suisse
securities
v.
simmonds.
mr.
landau,
you
may
proceed.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
lampf
was
a
disaster,
wasn't
it?
congress
had
to
try
to
patch
up
what
we
had
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we've
--
we've
said
that,
under
our
recent
jurisprudence
anyway,
we
would
--
we
would
treat
that
as
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
i
assume
we'd
treat
it
like
a
normal
statute
of
limitations
subject
to
tolling?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
whenever
--
whenever
we
encounter
a
--
a
statute
of
limitations
that
is
--
is
phrased
in
jurisdictional
term,
there
can
be
no
tolling?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
think
you
understate
the
--
the
strength
of
the
petitioners'
argument
in
--
in
this
regard.
it
seems
to
me
where
you
say,
you
know,
3
years
unless
the
plaintiff
knows
sooner
than
that,
and
then
you
say
2
years
unless
the
plaintiff
knows
earlier
than
that,
and
then
you
say
2
years,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
implication
is
2
years,
period.
whether
the
plaintiff
knows
earlier,
later,
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
what
if
those
three
provisions
had
been
--
you
know,
followed
each
other
immediately.
you
know,
3
years
unless,
you
know
--
with
a
cutoff
that
would
make
it
shorter,
and
2
years
with
a
cutoff
that
would
make
it
shorter,
and
then
a
third
one
just
says
2
years.
you
think
there
would
be
no
implication
that
the
2
years
means
2
years,
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
maybe
you'd
better
go
--
well,
go
on.
i
think
you
better
go
to
the
other
point,
because
i
want
to
know
whether
you
differ
from
the
petitioner
on
the
second
point.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner,
he
does
--
he
does
not
think
that
you
reach
the
same
result
if
indeed
the
violation
had
been
nonintentional.
now,
do
you
take
that
position
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you,
mr.
wall.
that's
a
nice
note
on
which
to
end.
mr.
tilden,
we
will
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
need
not
go
elsewhere,
but
when
they
have
gone
elsewhere
and
found
out
--
i
mean
in
this
case
it
was
not
just
that
you
reasonably
should
have
known
it's
that
you
did
know.
isn't
--
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
necessary
to
your
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
would
think,
if
the
16b
plaintiff
has
really
suffered
no
injury,
it
would
be
all
the
more
likely
that
congress
would
want
a
statute
of
repose.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
--
the
problem
i
have
with
your
argument
is,
it's
a
very
strange
statute
of
limitations.
accepting
that
it
is
not
a
statute
of
repose,
it
says,
you
know,
you
have
2
years
after
the
--
the
transaction
that
was
failed
to
be
reported.
and
you
want
to
say
what
it
means
is
you
have
2
years
from
the
time
it
was
reported.
congress
would
have
said
that.
it's
so
easy
to
say
that.
two
years
from
the
reporting.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
know
any
other
statute
of
limitations
that
achieves
the
result
that
you
want
that
puts
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you,
mr.
tilden.
mr.
landau,
you
have
4
minutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you
mr.
landau.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
under
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
a
corporation
or
a
security
holder
of
that
corporation
may
bring
suit
against
the
corporation's
insiders
who
realize
any
profits
from
the
purchase
and
sale
or
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
corporation's
securities
within
a
six-month
period.
these
profits
are
called
short-swing
profits.
section
16(b)
seeks
to
ensure
that
corporate
insiders
do
not
profit
from
inside
information
by
requiring
them
to
disgorge
these
"short-swing"
profits
to
turn
them
over
to
the
corporation.
in
a
successful
disgorgement
action
and
this
is
probably
not
irrelevant
to
the
present
case,
attorney's
fees
are
typically
awarded
to
the
victorious
plaintiff.
section
16(b)
imposes
a
form
of
strict
liability
requiring
disgorgement
even
if
the
insiders
did
not
trade
on
inside
information
or
intent
to
profit
on
the
basis
of
such
information.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
requirement
that
section
16(b)
actions
be
brought
within
two
years
after
the
date
the
profit
was
realized,
that's
what
the
statute
says.
vanessa
simmonds
filed
nearly
55
--
filed
55
nearly
identical
16(b)
disgorgement
actions
against
financial
institutions,
including
these
petitioners,
which
had
underwritten
various
initial
public
offerings,
ipos
in
the
1990s
and
2000.
she
did
not
bring
these
suits
until
2007,
but
contended
that
the
two-year
statute
did
not
apply
because
the
underwriters
had
failed
to
comply
with
section
16(a)
which
requires
corporate
insiders
to
file
disclosure
statements
showing
any
changes
in
their
ownership
interest.
as
relevant
here,
the
united
states
district
court
dismissed
24
of
simmonds'
lawsuits
on
the
ground
that
16(b)'s
two-year
period
had
expired
long
before
they
were
filed.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
citing
its
prior
decision
in
a
case
called
whittaker
v.
whittaker
corporation,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
16(b)'s
limitation
period
is
"tolled
until
the
insider
discloses
his
transactions
in
a
section
16(a)
filing,
regardless
of
whether
the
plaintiff
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
conduct
at
issue."
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
vacate
and
remand.
petitioners
maintain
that
16(b)'s
two-year
period
is
a
period
of
repose,
meaning
that
it
is
not
to
be
extended
to
account
for
a
plaintiff's
discovery
of
the
facts
underlying
a
claim.
it's
just
an
absolute
two-year
rule.
we
are
equally
divided
on
that
question,
but
we
conclude
that
even
assuming
the
two-year
period
can
be
extended,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
determining
that
it
isn't
--
that
it
is
tolled
until
the
filing
of
a
16(a)
statement.
section
16
itself
quite
clearly
does
not
extend
the
limitation's
period
until
a
16(a)
statement
is
filed.
the
two-year
clock
starts
from
the
date
such
profit
was
realized,
that's
what
it
says.
congress
could
very
easily
have
provided
that
"no
suit
shall
be
brought
more
than
two
years
after
the
filing
of
the
statement
under
16(a),"
it
did
not.
the
text
of
16(b)
simply
does
not
support
the
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
in
whittaker
and
affirmed
in
this
case.
in
whittaker,
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
background
rule
of
equitable
tolling
for
fraudulent
concealment
operates
to
toll
the
limitations
period
until
a
16(a)
statement
is
filed.
even
accepting
that
equitable
tolling
for
fraudulent
concealment
is
triggered
by
the
failure
to
file
a
16(a)
statement,
that
is
even
can
--
even
assuming
this
is
not
a
statute
of
repose,
the
whittaker
rule
is
completely
divorced
from
long
settled
equitable
tolling
principles.
we
have
said
that
generally,
a
litigant
seeking
equitable
tolling
bears
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he
"has
been
pursuing
his
rights
diligently."
it
is
well
established
moreover
that
a
limitation's
period
is
tolled
because
of
fraudulent
concealment
of
facts,
the
tolling
ceases
when
those
facts
are
or
should
have
been
discovered
by
the
plaintiff.
allowing
tolling
to
continue
beyond
that
point
and
until
a
16(a)
statement
is
filed
would
in
fact
be
inequitable
and
inconsistent
with
the
general
purpose
of
statute
--
of
statutes
of
limitations
which
is
to
protect
defendants
against
sale
or
unduly
delayed
claims.
simmonds'
arguments
in
support
of
the
whittaker
rule
are
unpersuasive.
she
argues
that
a
contrary
rule
would
obstruct
congress'
objective
of
curbing
"short-swing"
speculation.
this
objective
according
to
simmonds
is
served
by
16(a)
statements
which
provide
the
information
necessary
to
alert
plaintiffs
to
bring
16(b)
actions.
but
that
congressional
objective
is
fully
served
by
traditional
equitable
tolling
rules
under
which
the
limitation's
period
would
not
expire
until
two
years
after
a
reasonably
diligent
plaintiff
would
have
learned
the
facts
underlying
a
16(b)
action.
under
simmonds'
proposed
rule,
because
petitioners
have
still
not
filed
16(a)
statements,
they
contend
that
they're
not
even
subject
to
16(b),
she
still
has
two
years
to
bring
suit
even
though
she
is
so
well
aware
of
her
alleged
cause
of
action
that
she
has
already
sued.
simmonds
also
argues
that
application
of
the
established
equitable
tolling
doctrine
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress'
intention
to
establish
in
section
16
a
clear
rule
that
is
capable
of
"mechanical
application".
equitable
tolling
after
all
involves
fact
intensive
disputes
about
what
the
notice
was,
where
it
was
disseminated,
who
received
it,
and
when
it
was
received,
but
this
argument,
counsels
just
as
much
in
favor
of
no
tolling,
whatever,
that
is
in
favor
of
the
statute
of
repose
rule
as
it
does
in
favor
of
the
whittaker
rule.
no
tolling
is
certainly
an
easily
administrable
bright
line
rule
and
assuming
some
form
of
tolling
does
apply,
we
conclude
it
is
preferable
to
apply
that
form
which
congress
was
certainly
aware
of
as
opposed
to
the
rule
the
court
of
appeals
had
fashioned.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
lower
courts
to
consider
how
the
usual
rules
of
equitable
tolling
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous
except
for
the
chief
justice
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
