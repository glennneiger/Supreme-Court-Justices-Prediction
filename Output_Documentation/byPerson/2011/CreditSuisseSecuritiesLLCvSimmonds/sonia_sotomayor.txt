justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
would--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
the
problem
is
that
the
injury
here
is
the
defendant's
conduct,
meaning
if
the
nature
of
the
claim,
as
is
here,
is
that
someone
has
received
a
profit
they
are
not
entitled
to,
then
the
injury
is
the
same.
the
profit
belonged
to
the
shareholders
or
the
corporation,
not
to
the
insider.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--textually
the
nature
of
the
claim
here
is
the
very
injury,
plaintiff's
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
disgorgement
is
injury,
meaning
that
it's
something
that
--
that
you
are
taking
away
from
someone
else.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
logic
there
is
in
reading
this
as
a
statute
of
repose,
other
than
your
argument
about
finality
and
its
importance.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
take
your
adversary's
position
that
this
statute
of
limitations
was
geared
under
an
understanding
that
an
insider
would
in
fact
make
the
requirements
--
would
file
the
statements
required
by
16(a),
then
it
makes
absolute
sense
to
think
of
it
as
a
statute
of
repose.
but
if
congress
understood
that
some
wouldn't
do
the
statutory
requirement
and
file
in
a
timely
manner,
why
wouldn't
equitable
tolling
be
a
more
appropriate
way
to
look
at
this?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
public
document
that
a
--
that
a
shareholder
can
look
at
to
see
whether
an
insider
has
traded
within
6
months?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
didn't
ask
that.
i'm
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
is
how
easy
is
it
to
find
out
without
the
16(a)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
big
thing.
i
didn't
ask
maybe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
the
likelihood
that
a
broker's
going
to
turn
you
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
very
nice
thing,
but
how
likely
is
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
would
the
broker
know
that
the
--
that
his
principal
didn't
file
a
form
he
was
required
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
was
hidden
from
you
in
the
prior
filings
in
the
academic
literature
that
your
adversary
points
to?
all
of
the
facts
you've
just
recited
have
been
written
about
extensively
for
years
and
years.
so,
what
new
information
did
you
receive,
told
you
that
you
should
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
somebody's
investing
in
the
amounts
that
are
invested
here
and
they
are
not
following
the
fact
that
this
has
been
the
center
of
securities
litigation
for
years?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
answer
what
i
consider
a
very
strong
argument
on
their
side,
which
is
congress
who
creates
a
statute
of
repose
for
intentional
conduct
like
fraud,
why
would
they
not
create
a
statute
of
repose
for
what
is
a
strict
liability
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
the
sg's.
