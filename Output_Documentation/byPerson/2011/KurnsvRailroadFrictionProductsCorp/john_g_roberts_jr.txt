chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
10-879,
kurns
v.
railroad
friction
products
corporation.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
counsel,
looking
at
napier,
the
power
that
justice
brandeis
said
was
conferred
in
that
case
was
to
specify
the
sort
of
equipment
to
be
used
on
locomotives;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
equipment
that
was
used
in
locomotives?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
the
same
--
that's
the
same
thing,
thing,
i'll
give
you
that,
fitness
for
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
something
that's
going
to
cause
harm
while
it's
actually
being
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
does
it
depend?
you
want
to
know
if
this
equipment
is
safe
to
operate,
right,
to
be
used,
whether
--
whether
it's
going
to
be
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
have
a
boiler
that's
going
to
be
used,
that's
within
the
power
that
was
confirmed.
it's
not
merely
to
inspect,
as
again,
as
justice
brandeis
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
your
argument
isn't
limited
to
being
taken
apart.
your
argument
does
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
asbestos
doesn't
come
out
during
use;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
if
there
is
an
accident
or
something
does
the
asbestos
come
out
during
the
use
of
the
locomotive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
old
insurance
cases
we've
had,
that,
you
know,
when
the
car,
you
know,
slams
into
a
pole
or
something,
it's
not
being
used
as
a
car
anymore,
and
therefore,
the
insurance
doesn't
cover
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
you're
talking
about
--
i
bet
there
are
a
lot
of
things
on
railroad
cars
that
you
can
fix
in
the
shop
or
you
can
fix
while
it's
under
way,
right?
we
are
not
always
talking
about
brakes.
so
let's
suppose
there's
one
of
those
things.
you
get
to
the
shop
and
the
guy
says:
boy,
you
got
to
fix
this.
and
they
said:
well,
the
train's
leaving
and
we're
going
to
go
in
10
hours.
and
he
says:
okay,
i
can
fix
it
during
the
--
while
it's
in
use.
is
that
covered
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
line
you've
been
talking
about
between
the
repair
shop
and
the
locomotive
on
the
tracks,
that's
not
really
the
line
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
this
is
something
you
can
fix
in
either
place.
it's
covered
while
it's
--
if
you
fix
it
while
the
train
is
under
way,
but
it's
not
covered
if
you
wait
until
it's
in
the
shop?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
it's
not
whether
it's
in
use
or
in
the
shop.
it's
whether
it
is
something
that
affects
whether
the
locomotive
can
go,
whether
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hacker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
knows
--
it
knows
about
napier
and
what's
been
going
on
for
85
years,
and
if
it
wants
to
pull
back
on
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
provisions
interpreted
in
napier,
it's
free
to
do
that,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-879,
kurns
versus
railroad
friction
products
corporation.
