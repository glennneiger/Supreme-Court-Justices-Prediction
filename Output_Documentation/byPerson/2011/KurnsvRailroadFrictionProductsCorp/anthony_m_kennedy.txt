it's
not
clear
to
me
why
a
railroad
executive
couldn't
say,
now
i
need
to
use
10
locomotives
in
this
division
because
i
will
be
using
two
of
them
every
week
in
the
repair
shop
to
repair
them,
right?
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
use,
but
you
don't,
you
don't
seem
to
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
it's
use
on
the
line,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
repair
shop
is
an
obvious
extension
of
the
line.
everybody
knows
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
spend
one
day
a
month
in
the
repair
shop,
and
that's
just
part
of
--
of
the
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
allegation
is
it's
the
failure
to
warn
workers
to
use
a
special
kind
of
mask
that's
very
important
if
you're
working
near
asbestos.
that's
the
claim
they
want.
now,
are
you
saying
that
the
manufacturer
cannot
be
required
to
give
that
warning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
also
saying
the
railroad
cannot
be
forced
to
give
that
warning
in
its
repair
shop?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
can
the
railroad
be
held
liable
for
failing
to
tell
the
worker
to
use
the
mask?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
could
--
could
state
law
say
you
need
a
special
kind
of
mask?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
an
independent
contractor
who
is
not
covered
by
<fela>
[=
fela]?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
state
law
which
by
hypothesis
says
you
need
this
very
special
kind
of
mask.
it's
required
only
in
illinois.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
railroad
be
held
liable
for
failure
to
do
that
kind
of
mask
under
state
law
if
it's
not
a
fela
worker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
this
question.
is
it
your
position
that
the
engine
is
as
much
in
use
when
it's
in
the
shop
as
when
it's
running
on
the
track?
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
reason
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
important
is
that
i
can't
conceive
of
50
different
state
regulations
for
the
kind
of
gloves
and
things
that
the
engineer
has
to
wear
on
--
when
he
is
running
the
train
on
the
track,
and
if
that's
so,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
help
you
to
say
that
the
shop
was
the
same
but
you
seem
to
say
the
shop
was
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
failure
to
warn
problem
in
this
case?
