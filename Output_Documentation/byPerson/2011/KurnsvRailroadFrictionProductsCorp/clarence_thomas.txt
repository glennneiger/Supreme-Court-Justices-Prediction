justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
george
corson
worked
as
a
welder
and
a
machinist
in
loco
in
the
locomotive
repair
and
maintenance
facilities.
his
duties
included
installing
brake
shoes
and
locomotives
--
on
locomotives
and
stripping
insulation
from
locomotive
boilers.
corson
was
diagnosed
with
cancer
following
his
retirement.
corson
and
his
wife
filed
suit
in
pennsylvania
state
court
against
various
defendants,
including
respondents
here,
alleging
that
corson
was
injured
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
asbestos
during
the
course
of
his
employment.
according
to
the
complaint,
respondents'
manufactured
or
distributed
locomotive
parts
containing
asbestos
that
were
handled
by
corson.
the
complaint
asserted
state
law
claims
that
respondents'
products
were
defectively
designed
and
that
respondents
failed
to
warn
of
the
dangers
posed
by
asbestos.
corson
passed
away
after
the
complaint
was
filed
and
gloria
kurns,
the
executrix
of
the
estate,
was
substituted
as
a
party.
she
is
the
petitioner
here
along
with
corson's
widow.
respondents
removed
the
case
to
federal
court.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
respondents,
holding
that
petitioner's
state
law
claims
were
preempted
by
the
federal
locomotive
inspection
act.
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
also
affirm.
the
locomotive
inspection
act
is
silent
as
to
its
preemptive
effect,
but
this
court
held
in
napier
versus
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
company
that
the
act
manifest
an
intention
to
occupy
the
entire
field
of
regulating
locomotive
equipment.
petitioners
do
--
and
ask
us
to
overrule
napier
and
we
find
that
napier
compels
the
conclusion
that
petitioner's
tort
claims
were
preempted.
we
first
reject
petitioner's
claim
that
a
subsequently
enacted
statute,
the
federal
railroad
safety
act
narrowed
the
locomotive
inspection
act's
preemptive
scope.
the
railroad
safety
act
leaves
preexisting
statutes
like
the
locomotive
inspection
act
intact.
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
the
railroad
safety
act
left
the
preemptive
reach
of
the
locomotive
inspection
act
in
place.
petitioners
--
petitioners
alternatively
contend
that
their
claims
do
not
fall
within
napier's
definition
of
the
field
preempted
by
the
locomotive
inspection
act.
they
argue
that
the
state
law
claims
arising
from
the
repair
or
maintenance
of
locomotives
as
opposed
to
claims
arising
from
the
use
of
locomotives
on
the
railway
do
not
fall
within
the
preempted
field.
that
argument
is
inconsistent
with
napier's
holding
that
congress
“manifested
the
intention
to
occupy
the
entire
field
of
regulating
locomotive
equipment.”
napier
did
not
distinguish
between
hazards
arising
from
repair
and
those
arising
from
use
on
the
line.
we
are
also
unpersuaded
by
petitioners'
argument
that
their
failure
to
warn
claims
do
not
fall
within
the
preempted
field.
a
failure
to
warn
claim
alleges
that
a
product
itself
is
unlawfully
dangerous
unless
accompanied
by
warnings
or
instructions
deemed
sufficient
by
a
state
law.
petitioners'
failure
to
warn
claims
are
therefore
directed
at
the
equipment
of
locomotives
and
fall
within
the
preempted
field.
for
these
reasons
and
other
reasons
discussed
in
our
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
join.
