kagan
could
i
make
sure
i
understand
you?
if
--
if
the
secretary
tomorrow
decided
to
issue
a
regulation
saying
railroads
should
no
longer
use
these
asbestos-containing
brakes
because
of
the
hazards
in
the
repair
shop,
do
you
think
the
secretary
could
not
do
that
under
the
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
secretary
cannot
do
that
under
lia?
is
that
the
idea?
justice
elena
kagan
okay,
then
i'm
a
little
bit
lost.
if
the
secretary
can
issue
such
a
regulation
under
lia,
l-i-a,
then
isn't
it
in
the
scope
of
regulation,
and
then
isn't
it
also
in
the
scope
of
what's
preempted?
justice
elena
kagan
so
on
that
question,
ms.
harrington,
i'm
still
confused
about
the
scope
of
your
regulatory
authority
and
whether
you
think
you
have
the
capacity
to
issue
rules
that
are
meant
to
protect
repair
workers
on
railway
equipment.
so
can
you
issue
a
rule
under
the
lia
that
says
no
asbestos-containing
brakes
because
we
are
afraid
that
these
brakes
injure
the
guys
in
the
roundhouse.
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
does
seem
a
very
limiting
construction.
napier
seems
to
have
a
broader
construction,
and
if
i
read
some
of
your
history
right
you've
taken
a
broader
understanding
of
your
regulatory
authority
in
the
past.
so
why
this
narrow
view?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
hacker,
could
you
explain
to
me,
i
wasn't
sure
reading
your
brief
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
government's
point
that
the
agency
cannot
under
the
lia
issue
the
kind
of
rule
that
i
suggested
just,
you
know,
saying
no
asbestos
containing
brakes
because
of
the
danger
that
those
brakes
pose
to
the
repairmen.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
is
that?
if
they
are
right
as
to
the
scope
of
their
authority
and
maybe
they
are
not
right,
but
if
they
are
right
about
the
scope
of
their
authority
why
doesn't
it
follow
that
these
claims
would
not
be
field
preempted;
might
be
conflict
preempted
but
would
not
be
field
preempted
because
we
are
no
longer
in
the
field.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hacker,
do
you
think
we
would
decide
napier
the
same
way
if
it
came
to
us
today?
