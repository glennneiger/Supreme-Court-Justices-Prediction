ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
helpful
in
this
case
to
try
to
separate
out
the
field
preemption
issues
from
the
conflict
preemption
issues.
in
the
government's
view,
the
only
issue
properly
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner's
tort
claims
fall
within
the
field
preempted
by
the
lia,
and
our
view
is
that
they
do
not
because
they
arise
from
injuries
that
occurred
when
the
locomotive
was
not
in
use.
now,
respondent
would
have
the
court
expand
the
field
that's
preempted
by
the
lia
to
include
any
claim
that
has
anything
to
do
with
locomotive
equipment,
regardless
of
whether
the
equipment
or
the
locomotive
was
in
use
at
the
time
injury
occurred.
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
to--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--absolutely.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
completely
agree
with
what
you're
saying.
and
--
and
i'm
sorry
if
you
missed
--
if
we
didn't
state
our
position
clearly
in
our
brief.
our
view
is
that
those
kinds
of
requirements
--
requirements
that
go
to
the
design,
construction,
or
materials
on
a
locomotive
that
will
be
used,
if
those
requirements
are
directed
at
the
repair
shop,
then
they
would
be
conflict
preempted.
but
they
wouldn't
fall
within
the
field
that's
governed
by
lia
because
the
lia's
substantive
standard
of
care
only
applies
to
locomotives
that
are
in
use.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
i'm
sorry.
let
me
clarify.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
clarify.
in
our
view,
what
the
conflict
is,
is
not
a
conflict
with
a
federal
rule
saying
you
have
to
use
this
piece
of
equipment
and
you
can't
use
that
piece
of
equipment.
the
conflict
is
with
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
lia,
which
is
that
the
federal
government
be
the
only
regulator
of
equipment
that
will
be
used
on
a
locomotive.
and
so
what
that
means
is
if,
if
the
federal
government
hasn't
spoken
to
whether
piece
of
equipment
a
can
be
used
on
a
locomotive,
that
means
that
it
can
be,
that
the
manufacturers
know
that
it's
okay.
and
if
you
have
a
state
rule
that
would
have
the
effect
of
dictating
the
equipment
that
can
be
used
on
a
locomotive,
that
would
conflict
with
the
single
regulator
objective
of
the
lia.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
what
the
warning
claim
is.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
under
the
--
under
the
respondents
--
under
the
respondents'
view
of
the
field
that's
preempted,
a
state
could
not
regulate
the
disposal
of
equipment
that's
removed
from
a
locomotive
during
their
repair
process,
even
though--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no.
but
also--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--also,
in
respondent's
view
a
state
could
not
regulate
workplace
hazard,
such
as
by
requiring
that
workers
wear
goggles
or
masks.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes,
but
when
you're--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no.
i
think
you
could
--
i'm
sorry.
i
think
you
could
imagine
a
world
where
a
state
says
when
a
locomotive
comes
into
a
repair
shop
the
railroad
or
the
repair
shop
has
to
attach
a
certain
kind
of
clamp
on
the
wheel,
a
certain
kind
of
brake,
that
makes
sure
that
the
locomotive
won't
move
while
it
is
in
the
repair
shop.
and
when
you're
done
repairing
the
locomotive
you
take
them
off
and
the
locomotive
has--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
think
in
this
case
the
claims
that
we
say
would
not
be
conflict
preempted
or
within
the
field
are
claims
--
are
the
failure
to
warn
claims.
now,
how
a
manufacturer
actually
issues
the
warning
that
would
be
required
i
think
is
a
question
that
could
be
worked
out
as
the
case
proceeds.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
again
i
think
it
depends
how
the
warning
is
issued.
you
could
require
that
the
manufacturer
tell
the
purchaser
of
the
products
to
pass
the
warning
along,
to
post
warnings
in
a
repair
shop.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
they
could
require
it
contractual
through
the
sale
of
the
product.
i
think
those
sorts
of
detailed
issues
would
be
things
that
would
be
worked
out
on
a
remand
in
this
case.
again,
in
our
view,
the
only
question
squarely
presented
in
this
case
is
the
field
preemption
question.
and--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no.
the
lia
--
the
standard
of
care
under
the
lia
only
goes
to
whether
a
locomotive
is
safe
for
use,
and
that
is
also
the
limit
of
the
fra's
regulatory
authority.
this
court,
in
the
united
states
v.
b&o.
addressed
that
issue.
the
icc
at
the
time
had
issued
a
regulation
requiring
a
certain
kind
of
reverse
gear
instead
of
a
different
kind
of
reverse
gear.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
because
the
statute
says
safe
for
use
on
--
"safe
for
use
on
the
line.
"
it's
safe
for
use
on
lines
of
interstate
commerce.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i'm
not
aware
that
we've
taken
a
broader
view
of
our
regulatory
authority
under
the
lia.
in
napier
again
what's
important
to
remember
is
that
the
state
statute
at
issue
applied
only
to
locomotives
that
were
in
use.
and
so
i
think
it's
hard
to
take
any
statements,
any
broad
statements,
that
were
made
in
napier
and
read
them
as
applying--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
again
the
lia
only
applies
to
the
locomotive.
so
if
the
thing
that's
broken
that
you
could
fix
while
it's
in
use
would
not
make
the
locomotive
unsafe
to
use,
then
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
to
use
it
while--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--the
line
is
in
use
versus
not
in
use.
and
that
tends
to
match--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well
if
the
--
if
the
fact
that
it's
broken
makes
the
locomotive
unsafe
to
use,
then
the
railroad
cannot
use
it,
cannot
repair
it
while
it's
in
use.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
right.
but
here
the
injuries
occur
when
the
locomotive
is
not
in
use
because
it's
in
the
repair
shop.
and
in
those
situations
the
lia's
substantive
heightened
duty
of
care
doesn't
even
apply
and
so
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
think
of
those
claims
as
being
within
the
field
that's
preempted
by
the
lia,
because
they're
not
governed
by
the
lia.
now
those
claims
might
bump
up
against
the
lia
in
a
different
way
by
conflicting
again
with
the--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
we
agree
that
they
might
be
barred.
i
think
this
case
comes
to
the
court
without
any
real
development
of
the
plaintiff's
claims.
all
we
have
is
what
they
stated
in
their
complaint.
their
complaint
incorporates
a
master
complaint
which
applies
to
all
sorts
of
different
kinds
of
plaintiffs.
so
i
think
it's
really
hard
to
understand
exactly
what
their
claims
are,
what
the
effects
of
their
claims
would
be
with
respect
to
the
design
defect
claims.
and
so
in
our
view
they
would
--
the
design
defect
claims
would
be
preempted
if
they
would
have
the
effect
of
dictating
the
character
of
equipment
that
could
be
on
a
locomotive
while
it
was
in
use.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you.
