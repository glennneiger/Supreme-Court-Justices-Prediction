justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
concerned
about
i
think
is
the
same
thing
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned,
the
particular
language
in
napier.
and
whatever
--
however
this
might
come
out
today
if
napier
were
decided
again,
it
did
come
out
the
way
it
did.
and
justice
brandeis
did
write
it,
and
it's
been
the
law
a
long
time.
and
the
argument
is
made
in
napier
that
this
particular
state
regulation
is
aimed
at
preventing
sickness
and
disease,
not
at
making
locomotives
safe,
and
therefore
it's
not
preempted.
and
the
answer
to
that
was
not:
sickness
and
disease
are
an
object
of
the
statute,
too.
the
answer
was
the
federal
and
the
state
statutes
are
directed
to
the
same
subject,
the
equipment
of
locomotives,
and
therefore
it
is
preemptive.
now,
how
could
we
come
out
in
your
favor
without
overturning
what
seems
to
be
that
key
sentence
in
napier?
that
is
the
problem
that's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
a
--
the
problem
with
a
is
that
it's
been
followed
and
followed
and
followed
and
followed,
and
really
read
for
all
its
worth,
and
so
forth.
so
--
so
one
question
is,
to
what
extent
can
i
go
back
and
revise
that
sentence?
that's
a.
okay?
what's
b?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
--
now,
is
there
any
way
that
you
could
win
your
case
--
reasonably,
in
a
reasonable
way,
not
some
far-out
way
--
but
you
win
your
case
on
this,
and
it
does
not
affect
the
manufacturers'
way
of
dealing
with
their
equipment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
--
you
just
said
that,
which
i
think
you
certainly
have
the
right
to
bring
a
claim,
don't
you,
to
say
the
repair
shop
doesn't
have
adequate
warnings.
and
if
--
if
that's
--
if
the
railroad's
at
fault
in
that,
or
the
manufacturers
or
the
owner
of
the
repair
shop,
everybody
who
ever
puts
the
asbestos
in
there
is
negligent
in
not
putting
up
adequate
warnings.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
what
about
--
what
about
not
--
what
about
getting
away
from
the
equipment
and
saying
the
failure
here
is
not
to
fail
to
put
it
on
the
equipment;
it's
to
fail
to
put
it
in
the
repair
shop.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
something
i'm
not
seeing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
the
difference
then?
how
do
you
do
it?
how
do
you
--
what
is
it
you're
thinking
of
that
the
manufacturer's
going
to
have
to
do
in
respect
to
his
locomotive
in
order
to
comply
with
the
state
law
about
warning
that
is
not
going
to
mean
that
he
changes
the
locomotive
when
it
runs
on
the
railroad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
give
me
an
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
the
removal,
never
further
--
no
further
use
of
a
bit
of
a
locomotive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
let's
get
to
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
didn't
know
anybody
denied
that,
that
the
state
could
regulate
the
repair
shop,
indeed
require
what
warnings
they
wish,
indeed
require
what
equipment
workers
have
to
have.
i
thought
we
are
only
talking
about
those
rules
of
state
law
that
would
affect
what
the
manufacturer
has
to
put
by
way
of
design
in
his
locomotive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble.
i'm
thinking
one
that
would
only
affect
repair
shops
and
repairs,
but
maybe
there
is
some
kind
of
equipment
that
you
could
stick
on
the
front
of
it
and
it
is
a
hook
or
something
and
it
holds
something,
and
before
it
goes
back
on
the
line
you
take
it
off
and
put
it
in
the
locker.
and
--
but
you
know,
the
more
i
thought
along
those
lines
i
thought
i'm
getting
into
outer
space.
this
isn't
reality.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now,
does
that
have
more
than
theoretical
value
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
their
law
be
preempted,
a
law
be
preempted,
a
state
law
that
says:
since
the
railroad
knows
that
asbestos
is
dangerous
when
revealed
and
since
it
would
be
revealed
in
a
repair
shop,
the
railroad
has
to
provide
the
repair
shops
with
appropriate
worker
safety
equipment;
or
alternatively,
in
lesser,
the
railroad
has
to
provide
for
the
repair
shop's
documents
to
be
given
to
the
workers
which
explain
the
risks
and
how
they
can
overcome
them.
now,
in
respect
to
that,
which
i'll
lump
under
various
kinds
of
failure-to-warn
claims,
how
does
the
act
preempt
those?
it
doesn't
affect
design
of
the
railroad,
nor
does
it
affect
the
use.
neither.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
that
argument
would
prevent
states
doing
what
they
can
do
lawfully
which
is
to
regulate
the
repair
shop.
because
with
any
given
repair,
with
many
of
them
you
could
say,
well,
we
wouldn't
have
to
--
we
could
just
change
the
locomotive
design,
for
example.
it
carries
beds
with
it
so
that
the
workers
who
are
repairing
it
get
adequate
sleep.
i
mean,
that
isn't
an
answer
to
the
argument
that
it
doesn't
affect
design
to
say
well,
they
could
comply
with
it
by
changing
design,
i
don't
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
saying
is
because
when
you
open
up
the
box,
something
no
one
does
on
line,
you
will
expose
yourself
to
risks.
and
what
we
are
saying
is,
therefore,
you
must
post
a
notice
that
tells
workers
about
those
risks.
and
indeed
there
is
a
conflict,
conflict
preemption
will
take
care
of
it.
but
why
should
that
kind
of
thing
fall
within
the
scope
of
field
preemption
even
under
napier
which,
of
course,
referred
to
equipment
while
this
rule
doesn't.
it
refers
to
a
sign.
you're
not
going
to
change
the
equipment.
