mr.
jonathan
hacker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
lia
as
construed
by
this
court
in
napier,
in
particular
in
the
passage
quoted
by
justice
breyer,
delegates
to
the
dot
the
exclusive
authority
to
determine
the
design
and
the
materials
of
locomotive
equipment.
petitioners,
however,
argue
that
states
in
fact
may
dictate
locomotive
design
and
materials
so
long
as
they
do
so
for
some
purpose
other
than
safety
of
use
on
the
line.
but,
as
again
in
the
passage
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
napier
holds
that
la
--
lia
preemption
is
not
about
the
purpose
of
locomotive
equipment
regulation
and
is
not
about
the
geographic
location
of
the
locomotive
on
or
off
the
line
when
the
regulation
is
enforced,
as
justice
sotomayor
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
argument
this
morning.
regulatory
power
is
broader
than
purpose.
as
napier
says,
under
the
lia,
preemption
is
about
the
locomotive
equipment
itself.
what
napier
referred
to
as
the
physical
elements
of
the
locomotive.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
frankly,
i
would
have
thought
it
possible.
i
would
have
to
defer
to
the
dot's
view.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
within
dot's
power
under
the
lia
to
say
a
locomotive
is
not
safe
to
operate
if
it
can't
be
safely
repaired.
because
there
is
no
point
in
having
a
locomotive
ready
to
go
on
the
line
if
it
--
as
soon
as
it
comes
off
the
line
there's
a
problem
that's
going
to
injure
those
who
work
with
it.
but,
we
don't
need
to
assert
that
position
to
defend
the
proposition
we
have
now.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
because
the
field
is
not
--
it's
not
about
the
repair
shop
versus
not
the
repair
shop,
the
field
is
the
physical
elements
of
the
locomotive
itself.
what
states
cannot
do,
what
dot
has
exclusive
authority
over
is
the
design,
the
materials
and
the
construction
of
the
locomotive.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
think
we
are
not,
your
honor,
because
the
design
doesn't
change
between
the
line
and
the
repair
shop.
and
that's
the
key.
if
a
state
comes
in
and
says--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--i
understand,
but--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--but
the
statute
--
the
reason
the
statute
gives
power
to
the
dot
is
to
ensure
that
locomotives
are
safe
for
use
on
the
line.
but
in
order
to
accomplish
that
objective,
the
power
they
have
is
plenary
over
the
design
itself.
they
--
only
one
entity
gets
to
decide
what
the
design
is,
and
that's
dot.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
i
don't
necessarily
disagree.
we
would
necessarily
accept
that
proposition.
we
are
just
saying
you
don't
have
to
go
there.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
we
don't
disagree
with
you.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
would
say
--
two
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it
does
affect
design
because
a
way
to
comply
with
that
regulation
is
to
use
something
other
than
asbestos.
to
change
the
design.
it's
the
state
saying,
because
you're
using
this
design,
you
can
only
use
it
lawfully
in
this
state
if
you
do
the
following
two
or
three
things.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
at
common
law,
a
design
--
a
failure-to-warn
claim
was
a
type
of
design
defect
claim.
it
was
a
way
of
saying,
you
can't
use
that
design
lawfully
unless
you
have
the
following
type
of
warning.
if
you
--
you
can't
assume
away
the
design
aspect
of
it
because
it
still
turns
on,
it's
a
state
conditioning
the
design.
the
lia
and
the
flsa
and
scaa
and
osha
all
together
solved
this
problem
by
--
and
fela,
solved
this
problem
by
saying,
it
is
the
repair
shop's
responsibility
to
ensure
the
safety
of
workers.
we
are
not,
to
be
absolutely
clear
--
ms.
harrington
was
incorrect
when
she
said:
we
don't
believe
that
repair
shop
states
have
the
power
to
impose
workplace
conditions
to
protect
employee
safety
protection
in
the
repair
shop.
they
do.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
what
we
could
say
is
that
generally
applicable
laws
that
govern
the
repair
shop
--
states
have
the
authority
to
the
extent
not
preempted
by
osha,
states
have
authority
to
require
workplace
conditions
and
to
require
employers
to
protect
employees
working.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
tell
manufacturers,
here's
the
conditions
under
which
you
can
use
this
design,
sell
this
design,
distribute
the
design
and
these
materials
lawfully
within
the
state.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
we
agree
with
that.
we
also
think
it
applies
with
respect
to
manufacturers'
liability
in
the
repair
shop
for
the
reason
i
said
earlier.
the
locomotive
doesn't
change.
so
when
it's
certified
as
safe
for
use
on
line,
it
can't
be
--
and
the
locomotive
manufacturer
knows
everything
they
know
by
looking
at
dot
regulations.
it
can't
be
that
if
they
can
come
along
and
say:
no,
no,
you
can't
use
any
of
that
design,
you
have
to
use
this
completely
different
design
because
this
will
make
it
safe
in
the
repair
shop.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
for
the
reason
i
said
earlier,
your
honor,
which
is,
you
don't
know
in
advance.
if
you
say,
in
theory,
a
state
can
adopt
a
warning
requirement
specific
to
a
design
otherwise
approved
by
the
dot,
you
don't
know
in
advance
whether
the
warning
requirements
--
the
manufacturers
will
be
able
to
easily
comply
with
all
50
different
types
of
warning
requirements
and
whether
or
not
the
warning
requirements
--
some
will
be
so
stringent
that
it
will
be
easier
to
simply
adopt
a
different
design.
the
point
of
the
lia
is
to
take
that
kind
of
decision
making
out
of
the
state's
hands
and
put
it
into
a
federal
authority
which
can
make
the
relevant
and
appropriate
decisions
as
to
what
designs
are
unlawful.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
the
railroad
can
be
required
to
ensure
the
safe
protection
of
employees
that
work
there.
a
workplace
safety
sign
isn't
really
a
warning
claim.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
it
can
be
under
osha,
be
held
liable
for
that.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
no.
that
would
be
a
failure
to--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--because
they
have
the--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--railroads
have
a
duty
under
fela
to
ensure
a
safe
workplace
environment.
that's
clear.
and
so
they
have
adequate
incentives
to
ensure
that
their
employees
have
a
safe
work
environment.
if
they
are
--
if
a
worker's
exposed
to
asbestos--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--well,
not
under
the
current
regime
because
fela
would
preempt
any
claim
by
a
railroad
worker.
so
there
wouldn't
be
--
there
isn't
room
for
state
law.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
could
be
--
could
not
have
a
claim
against
the
manufacturer,
an
independent
contractor
would
not
have
claim
against
the
manufacturer--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--right.
the
manufacturer
could
not
be
held
liable
under
that
state
law.
that
would
be
a
condition
on
the
design,
an
effort
by
the
state
to
prescribe
the
condition,
the
type
of
design
that
can
be--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--if
it's
a
generally
applicable
law
about
asbestos
use,
yes.
i
would
say
at
some
point
a
law
like
that
that's
directed
to
a
particular
type
of
equipment
becomes
potentially
conflict
preemptive
because
it
puts
the
condition
on
the
design
of
the
particular
equipment.
states
are
free
to
enforce
generally
applicable
laws
about
safe
workplace
environments,
asbestos
handling.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
that
position.
we
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
a
--
because
we
don't
believe
you
have
to
establish
that
it's
in
use
in
the
repair
shop
to
establish
that
the
preemption
described
by
justice
brandeis
in
napier
controls,
because
the
preemption
he
was
describing
was
--
the
regulatory
authority
was
over
the
equipment
itself
which
is
the
same
exact
equipment.
a
railroad
--
a
locomotive
designed
a
particular
way
doesn't
change
when
it
enters
the
repair
shop,
so
it's
designed
to
be
fit
for
service.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
well,
i
only
mean
to
say
that
our
position
doesn't
change
whether
or
not
the
shop
is
different;
because
it's
not,
the
lia
preemption
--
lia
regulation
isn't
about
repairing.
the
dot
may
well
have
authority
--
they
seem
to
think
not
--
over
repairs
under
the
lia;
but
what
the
lia
is
about
is
the
design
and
the
materials
themselves,
and
states
can't
say
for
themselves
what
a
better
or
more
preferable
or
a
locomotive
design
is
for
any
other
reason.
the
respondents'
brief
and
reply
brief
on
page
5
makes
an
interesting
point.
they
think
they
have
proved
their
case
when
they
say
the
lia
doesn't
for
example
permit
the
dot
to
impose
a
u.s.
steel
requirement,
a
domestic
content
requirement
on
locomotives.
the
implication
would
be,
of
course,
that
a
state
could,
because
it's
outside
the
field
as
petitioners
define
it,
that
a
state
could
say
locomotives
can
only
be
used
within
our
state
if
they
are
made
of
u.s.
steel.
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
sense
at
all.
it
can't
possibly
be
right,
and
the
reason
it's
not
right
is
that
it
misunderstands
preemption
under
the
lia
as
described
by
napier.
of
course
it's
within
the
general
authority
of
the
dot
to
determine
that
a
locomotive
should
be
made
with
u.s.
steel,
but
that
authority
can
be
abused.
it
might
be
arbitrary
and
capricious;
it's
not
permissible
for
them
to
do
that.
but
the
content
of
locomotives
is
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
dot,
and
states
can't
decide
for
themselves
that
a
locomotive
otherwise
compliant
under
federal
regulations
is--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--well,
that's
part
of
their
argument,
but
their
main
claim
is
the
first
one,
which
is
that
you
are
prohibited
in
this
state
from
using
asbestos.
it
can't
happen,
even
though
federal
regulations
said
you
could.
that's
the
main
part
of
their
claim.
they
have
a
secondary
claim
which
is
failure
to
warn,
and
which
we
submit
is
essentially
a
type
of
design
defect
claim
that
says
if
you're
going
to
use
asbestos,
then
you
have
to
warn.
and
we
don't
even
know
--
as
miss
harrington
is
describing,
there's
a
lot
--
there
would
be
a
lot
to
be
determined
if
conflict
preemption
applies
to
failure
to
warn
in
a
given
case.
that's
the
whole
problem,
your
honors,
is
that
the
lia
was
saying
we
don't
want
to
expose
manufacturers
to
the
potential
of
future
state
court
litigation.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
think
it's
presented
here.
i
mean,
we
think
it's
completely
caught
up
in
the
design
defect
issue,
but
the
other
side
is
--
is
trying
to
defend
by
saying
we
have
a
design
defect
claim
but
we
also
have
a
failure
to
warn
claim;
but
we
submit
the
two
are
bound
up
together.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
that's
correct.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
that's
correct
and
that's
what
judge
koscinski
said
in
the
law
case,
and
judge
winters
said
in--
mr.
jonathan
hacker
--i
--
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
don't
--
two
things
i
would
say.
i
don't
know
the
answer
for
sure
but
i
think
there
probably
are,
but
there
are
also
repair
shops
that
then
--
that
are
owned
by
other
railroads,
and
that's
part
of
a
problem
that
manufacturers
have,
is
you
don't
know
when
you
sell
the
--
the
locomotive
to
a
railroad
who
is
going
to
be
servicing
under
what
conditions.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
yes.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
specific
to
the
equipment
itself.
what
we
would
say
is
the
state
has
to
take
the
locomotive
equipment
as
a
given.
it
is
what
it
is.
and
then
if
that
locomotive
equipment
creates
risks
for
workers,
the
employer
may
have
to
do
things
to
account
for
those
risks,
but
the
equipment
can't
be
regulated
by
the
state.
the
equipment
itself
can't
be
regulated
by
the
state
in
any
respect.
mr.
jonathan
hacker
i
do
think
so,
your
honor.
of
course
i
don't
think
that
matters
because
napier
is
what
it
is
and
has
been
relied
upon
for
85
years.
but
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
good
argument
that
it
would
be
decided
the
same
way
today
under
the
ray
case
that
justice
sotomayor
mentioned,
was
a
very
similar
kind
of
delegation
of
regulatory
authority;
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
the
same
kind
of
field
preemption.
there
are
some
differences
one
could
discuss,
but
napier
is
what
it
is,
as
i
say.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions
i'll
cede
the
balance
of
my
time.
