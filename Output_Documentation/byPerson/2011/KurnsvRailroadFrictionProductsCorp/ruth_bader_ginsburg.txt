mr.
frederick,
could
you
--
could
you
clarify
what
is
at
stake
for
the
worker
here?
the
railroad
worker
ordinarily
has
the
fela
claim,
but
the
fela
claim
in
this
case
was
dismissed.
so
can
you
tell
us
what
recourse
--
if
you
lose,
what
recovery
can
this
plaintiff
get?
and
also
explain
to
me
why
the
fela
claim
was
--
was
dismissed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
you
explain
the
difference
that
--
you
make
a
distinction
between
field
preemption
and
conflict
preemption.
does
that
have
any
practical
significance
at
all
in
this
case,
because
i
thought
you
agreed
that
the
design
defect
claim
would
be
barred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
that
was
not
the
nature
of
the
notice
claim.
the
design
is
whatever
it
is.
but
the
manufacturer
has
to
issue
warnings
so
that
the
worker
can
protect
himself
against
that
hazard.
so
i
thought
that
--
defective
design,
yes,
i
understand
your
argument.
you
would
have
one
standard
for
on
the
line
and
another
when
it's
in
the
repair
shop.
but
this
is
not
telling
them
to
change
the
design
in
any
respect.
it
just
says
"asbestos".
you
could
take
these
measures
to
protect
yourself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
--
that
was
the
safety
act
and
they
didn't
amend
the
locomotive
act.
the
locomotive
act
is
what
it
was
and
they
didn't
put
that
clause
in
it.
