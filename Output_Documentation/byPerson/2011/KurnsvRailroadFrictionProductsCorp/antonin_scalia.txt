you
--
you
would
say
once
there
is
an
accident
and
the
locomotive
is
disabled,
it's
no
longer
in
use.
i
suppose
that's
what
you'd
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
unrealistic,
but
that's
what
you'd
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
--
don't
you
think
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
legislation,
which
everybody
understood,
was
to
enable
engine
manufacturers
to
be
able
to
construct
their
engines
without
having
to
worry
about
a
variety
of
different
state
requirements?
railroading
is
a
national
transportation
industry,
and
whoever
makes
the
engine
has
to
know,
if
i
do
it
this
way,
it's
going
to
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
it
won't
be
okay,
because,
although
every
state
may
have
--
every
state's
requirements
may
be
preempted
when
the
--
when
the
locomotive
is
in
use,
all
50
states
can
have
different
requirements
with
respect
to
what
the
design
has
to
be
in
order
to
make
the
engine
safe
when
it's
being
repaired.
i
think
that
truly
frustrates
the
purpose
of
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
--
i'm
not
concerned
about
conflict
preemption.
i'm
concerned
about
state
requirements
that
conflict
with
the
federal.
i'm
talking
about
50
state
requirements
that
conflict
with
each
other,
so
that
the
manufacturer
has
to
look
to
all
50
states
instead
of
looking
to
the
secretary
here,
which
says
your
engine
is
safe
if
you
do
this.
and
you're
telling
me
the
manufacturer
can
no
longer
assume
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
--
what
self-abnegation
by
the
federal
government,
that
"safe
for
use"
does
not
include
safe
for
use
when
it's
being
repaired.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
the
design,
materials
and
constructions
for
use.
if
you
make
that
concession,
it's
only
those
aspects
of
design,
materials
and
construction
that
pertain
to
use.
and
if
you
take
the
position
that
use
includes
only
use
on
the
line
and
not
use
when
it's
being
repaired
in
the
repair
shop,
i
think
you're
in
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
designed
for
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
word
"design";
i'm
talking
about
"design
for
use".
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
apply
to
the
repair
shop
would
also
apply
to
the
locomotive
in
use,
i,
suppose,
and
it
would
be
of
little
comfort
to
the
manufacturer
that
although
the
engine
he
has
manufactured
has
been
certified
as
safe
for
use
by
the
secretary,
he
is
liable
unless
he
warns
the
engineer:
oh,
it
isn't
safe
for
use
in
these
circumstances;
i
have
to
give
you
warning.
i
mean,
i
cannot
imagine
that
that's
what
--
that
that's
what
the
statute
means
as
applied,
at
least
to
the
use
of
the
engine
on
the
--
on
the
tracks.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
manufacturer
be
liable
for
failing
to
tell
the
railroad?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
the
railroad
going
know
whether
it's
unsafe
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
the
railroad
going
to
know
whether
there
is
asbestos
in
there
unless
the
manufacturer
at
least
tells
the
railroad,
even
it
doesn't
have
to
tell
the
worker?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
are
--
they
are
not
saying
here
you
have
to
manufacture
it
a
certain
way.
they
are
just
saying
if
you
manufacture
it
in
a
manner
that
we
consider
unsafe,
you
have
to
warn
people.
