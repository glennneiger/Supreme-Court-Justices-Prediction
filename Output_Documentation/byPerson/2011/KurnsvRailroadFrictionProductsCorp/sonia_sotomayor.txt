so
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
icc
in
1916,
in
the
tiller
case,
regulating
the
lights
that
railroads
had
to
have,
locomotives
had
to
have
in
the
yard,
and
that
those
lights
had
to
differ
when
the
railroad
was
in
use.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
it
prescribed
different
lights
when
the
--
when
the
--
when
the
locomotive
was
in
the
yard.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
safety
in
use.
it
had
to
do
with
safety
in
repair.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
distinguish
for
me
our
reasoning
in
the
ray
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
distinguish
for
me
the
difference
in
the
ray
case,
that
had
to
do
with
navigation,
and
where
we
held
that
the
agency,
in
ensuring
safety
in
navigation,
controlled
design
completely,
whether
in
repair
or
not.
so
how
do
we
--
why
don't
we
apply
the
logic
of
ray
to
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
argument
here,
which
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--once
you
regulate
what
--
what
the
design
or
use
of
asbestos
is,
you're
interfering
with
what
available
components
there
are
for
locomotives.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
giving
up
all
of
your
other
claims?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
this.
are
you
talking
about
wearing
a
particular
hazard
suit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
talking
about
blowing
out
air?
are
you
talking
about
changing
the
design
so
the
asbestos
comes
off
without
the
dust
cloud
that's
generally
created?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
the
manufacturer
is
really
not
controlling
the
repair
shop,
of
what
value
is
this
failure
to
warn
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
can't
control
whether
they
do
or
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
if
i'm
understanding
your
argument
correctly,
you're
saying
that
if
napier
controls
the
design
of
--
and
a
locomotive
part,
that
includes
any
design
defect
that's
encompassed
by
state
law,
whether
it's
design
in
its
traditional
sense
or
failure
to
warn?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
basically
what
the
court
below
said?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
as
a
practical
matter,
i'm
assuming
that
some
railroad
repair
yards
are
owned
by
the
railroad
itself,
so
the
railroad
repair
people
are
railroad
employees,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
there
some
that
are
not?
they
are
not
considered
railroad
employees
but
they
are
considered
something
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
to
be
--
just
to
be
clear,
under
your
view
of
the
lia
there
could
be
other
laws
that
preempt
it
or
prohibit
it?
states
can
tell
railroad
yards
put
signs
up,
wear
protective
equipment,
do
whatever
it
is
to
protect
the
worker
from
this
repair.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
just
can't
tell
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--include
a
warning
on
the
brake,
or
to--
