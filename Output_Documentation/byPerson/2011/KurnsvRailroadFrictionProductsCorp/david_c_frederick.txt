mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
locomotive
inspection
act
to
ensure
the
safety
of
locomotives
in
use
on
railroad
lines,
not
to
regulate
hazards
to
mechanics
conducting
repairs
of
locomotives.
the
doctrine
of
implied--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
was
actually
i
think
pursuant
to
the
safety
appliance
act,
justice
sotomayor,
if
i'm
not
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
and
the
principle
behind
the
safety
in
use
regulation
that
this
court
construed
in
napier
was
to
ensure
that
locomotives
were
safe
for
fit
use
on
the
line.
and
that
was
the
consistent
construction
both
in
the
icc's
statement
that
it
made
in
1922
and
in
this
court's
post-napier--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
our
position
is
that
it
was
not
pursuant
to
the
locomotive
inspection
act
that
the
icc
promulgated
that
rule.
as
the
court
has
said
in
numerous
cases,
the
icc
had
rules
in
place
with
respect
to
different
aspects
of
the
train
at
different
points
in
time,
but
the
locomotive
inspection
act
was
designed
to
address
a
very
specific
problem,
which
was
boilers
exploding
on
the
line
when
the
train
was
in
operation.
and
that
is
the
consistent
way
that
the
icc,
and
subsequently
the
federal
railroad
administration,
has
construed
the
act.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
of
course
in
ray
you
addressed
the
port
and
tanker
safety
act,
as
well
as
the
port
and
waterway
safety
act.
in
the
united
states
v.
locke
case,
the
court
subsequently
looked
at
ray
in
terms
of
design
in
a
statute
that
also
specifically
included
the
word
"repair
and
maintenance",
which
is
absent
here.
but
what
the
court
was
getting
at
in
ray
was
to
ensure
that
states
were
not
using
their
law
to
interfere
with
the
design
of
equipment.
of
course,
that
was
for--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
i
could
make
two
points
about
that,
justice
sotomayor.
that's
not
actually
correct.
the
first
is,
anything
that
the
court
might
think
about
design
does
not
impair
our
failure-to
warrant
claims,
which
entail
no
challenge
to
the
design
of
a
locomotive
at
all,
only
to
the
instructions
for
its
safe
use.
but
to
the
extent--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
my
second
argument
is
that
the
design
claim
here
involves
repair
work
or
problems
uniquely;
it
does
not
include
or
intrude
on
the
fitness
for
service
standard
that
this
court
announced
in
napier
or
that
has
consistently
been
applied.
the
asbestos
harms
that
the
repair
workers
here
faced
are
unique
to
the
repair
process,
where
they
are
scraping
over
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
but
on--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
also
says
on
page
612
that
the
power
delegated
by
congress
is
to
determine
fitness
for
service.
so
the
words
about
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
it
doesn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
principle
here
is
to
ensure
that
the
locomotives
when
they
are
outside
the
repair
yard
and
are
on
the
locomotive
--
on
the
railroad
line
--
are
--
are
safe
to
operate.
that
standard
and
napier
had
no
issue--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
to
be
broken
down.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
point
here
is
that
it
is
not
to
be
broken
down.
and
the
locomotive
repair
workers
here
face
unique
hazards
in
repairing
locomotives
whose
safety
standards
are
to
ensure
that
they
work
properly
on
the
rail
roadway,
not
when
they
are
being
taken
apart
and
repaired.
that
they
just--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
absolutely
correct.
that's
why
this
is
the
unique
cancer
faced
by
the
repair
workers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
it
did,
it
would
be
covered
under
the
locomotive
inspection
act
safety
standard,
and
that
would
be
covered
by
federal
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
well,
it's
governed
by
a
different
statute,
which
is
found
at
49
u.s.c.
303.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
if
i
could
finish
my
answer
to
your
previous
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
a
specific
statute
on
that
point,
and
it
predated
the
locomotive
inspection
act,
and
it
provided
that
when
there
was
a
crippled
locomotive,
the
--
the
railroad
did
not
face
liability,
civil
penalties,
to
bring
the
crippled
locomotive
back
to
the
yard,
but
it
specifically
said
if
a
worker
was
injured
during
that
process
the
railroad
would
face
liability.
our
point
here
is
that
the
locomotive
inspection
act's
field
should
be
construed
narrowly
because
in
1970
congress
expressly
and
comprehensively
legislated
in
the
federal
rail
safety
act
and
provided
a
conflict
preemption
regime
in
which
if
a
state
had
a
rule
in
place
that
rule
would
be
permitted
to
survive
unless
and
until
the
federal
rail
administration
issued
a
regulation.
and
there
has
never
been
a
regulation
on
asbestos.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
first,
i
would
urge
you
not
to
read
napier
like
a
statute,
although
justice
brandeis
is
obviously--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--b
is
that
he
was
addressing
himself
to
fitness
for
service
standards
on
the
line.
the
wisconsin
and
georgia
statutes
at
issue
there
purported
to
regulate
what
the
locomotive
could
do
while
it
was
in
operation
on
the
line.
that's
not
what
the
claims
in
this
case
are
about.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
first
is,
if
you
accept
our
proposition
that
warning
claims
are
valid
negligence
claims.
the
warning
claims
are
not
--
do
not
affect
the
equipment,
how
it
is
made
at
all.
it's
simply
how
do
you
use
the
equipment
safely.
secondly,
the
design
claims
here
go
to
the
unique
hazards
faced
by
repair
workers.
you
can
use
asbestos
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
on
the
locomotive
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
locomotive
equipment
manufacturers
have
done,
so
long
as
there
is
a
safer
way
to
take
the
asbestos
off
the
locomotive
in
the
repair
yard.
that
is
a
distinct
kind
of
design
claim
that
doesn't
go
to
the
safe
operation
of
the
locomotive.
it
goes
to
what
hazards
are
created
when
a
repair
worker
is
doing
maintenance
work
on
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--both.
the
dust
cloud
is
something
that
can
be
warned
against
and
protected
against
with
protective
gear
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
design
of
the
locomotive.
there
are,
and
there
is
evidence
that
there
are,
safer
and
were
safer
ways
--
i
remind
you
that
asbestos
isn't
used
on
locomotives
any
more,
so
this
is
part
of
an
historical
debate
here
--
but
in
ways
that
could
be
removed
that
would
not
create
the
cloud
dust.
that's
the
essence
of
the
design
defect
claim.
and
the
lia
and
the
fra
do
not
regulate
in
the
repair
shop.
so
there
is
a
completely
gap
here
in
terms--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
absolutely
--
absolutely
can
do
that
under
the
federal
rail
safety
act,
which
empowers
the
secretary.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
--
it
very
well
could,
because
it's
a
fitness
for
service
standard.
but
it
always
--
and
if
you
look
at
its
regulations,
in
parts
229
and
230
of
49
cfr,
it
always
issues
these
regulations
under
both
authorities,
because
the
frsa
expanded
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
have
to
do
so
under
the
b&o
railroad
case
in
the
early
1930s
--
there
was
another
justice
brandeis
opinion
--
in
which
it
would
have
to
make
a
finding
that
to
make
that
regulation
that
you
posit,
justice
kagan,
was
necessary
to
avoid
unnecessary
peril
to
life
or
limb.
in
that
case,
the
court
struck
down
the
icc's
attempt
to
issue
a
regulation
on
a
particular
type
of
equipment
because
the
icc
could
not
make
that
demonstration.
so
in
the
current
world,
the
fra
would
regulate
under
the
frsa;
it
would
not
regulate
under
the
lia,
because
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
it
is
a
harder
standard
to
meet
to
implement
a
regulatory
standard.
that's
our
point.
the
regulatory
field
here
does
not
need
to
be
read
as
expansively
as
the
other
side
posits,
because
the
fra
has
all
the
authority
it
needs
under
the
frsa
if
it
chooses
to
promulgate
those
rules,
and
it
has
not
chosen
to
promulgate
those
rules.
the
fra
can
use
conflict
preemption
to
displace
any
state
rule,
but
what
they
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
take
the
doctrine
of
implied
field
preemption,
gain
immunity
from
state
law
liability
and
not
be
subject
to
any
federal
rules.
and
it's
that
proposition
that
is
an
extraordinary
proposition
of
implied
field
preemption.
we've
found
no
case
from
this
court
that
goes
that
far.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
we
lose
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
the
decedent's
family
gets
nothing,
takes
nothing,
because
the
fela
claim
was
rendered
summary
judgment
on
the
finding
that
there
was
no
negligence
by
the
railroad.
the
only
claim
that
the
decedent's
family
has
here
is
a
third
party
claim
against
the
manufacturer
for
failing
to
warn
or
design
defect
on
the
basis
of
state
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
here
--
ordinarily,
you'd
bring
a
failure
to
warn
claim
directly
against
the
manufacturer
for
not
putting
in
the
manual
or
stamping
on
the
equipment
or
providing
instructions
for
safe
use.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
both.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
it's
--
it's
both.
manufacturers
routinely
are
held
liable
for
failing
to
warn
if
in
their
manuals
or
in
their
other
instruction
materials
they
do
not
provide
for
instructions
for
the
safe
use
of
their
equipment.
if
i
could
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
manufacturers
clearly
have
the
best
information
about
the
dangerous
aspects
of
their
products,
and
they
issue
warnings
and
instructions
in
manuals
and
provide
all
kinds
of
information
so
that
persons
working
on
their
equipment
are
going
to
know
the
special
hazards.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
inoculate
those
manufacturers
from
liability
where
they
have
the
best
information
to
ensure
that
repair
workers
are
not
going
to
be
exposed
to
risks.
with
respect
to
the
point
about
being
on
the
line,
the
whole
idea
behind
the
locomotive
inspection
act
was
not
just
for
use,
justice
kennedy,
but
also
"safe
to
operate
on
the
railroad
line.
"
under
the
regulations,
and
this
is
well
established,
yard
limits
are
drawn
outside
the
bowl
where
switching
operations
and
repair
operations
occur,
so
that
everybody
knows
where
the
federal
lia
standard
applies
and
where
it
doesn't.
and
the
reason
why
the
lia
has
had
this
kind
of
history
with
respect
to
repair
work
goes
to
the
history
of
--
behind
this
court's
recognition
of
the
commerce
power.
up
until
the
new
deal
era
it
was
well
settled
that
congress
could
not
legislate
on
intrastate
activities,
which
are
peculiar
to
repair
yards,
and
so
this
court
when
it
decided
the
shanks
case
in
the
mid
1910s
held
that
a
railroad
worker
could
not
bring
an
fela
claim
because
his
work
was
not
in
interstate
commerce;
it
was
only
in
intrastate
commerce;
and
that
is
why
the
icc
throughout
this
entire
period
never
devoted
regulations
to
repair
yards,
because
this
court's
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
precluded
federal
regulatory
activity
for
that.
so
if
you
look
at
this
case
from
an
historical
perspective,
justice
kagan,
it's
not
clear
that
the
full
parameters
of
the
way
the
court
would
explain
napier
would
be
the
same,
because
its
approach
to
field
preemption
is
so
different
after
the
new
deal
era
than
it
was
before
the
new
deal
era;
and
that
is
also
why
when
this
court
looks
at
regulatory
implications
of
common
law
claims,
it
has
had
no
problem
allowing
state
law
to
have
design
defect
claims
with
respect
to
planes,
cars,
motorboats
and
trucks,
even
though
the
implications
of
a
state
law
claim
might
find
liability
for
the
insufficiency
of
the
design
imposing
an
unreasonable
risk
to
the
person
who
is
exposed
to
that
risk
with
respect
to
that
interstate
modality.
there
is
no
reason
why
you
have
to
have
a
broad
and
expansive
view
of
the
field
here
because
congress
subsequently
has
enacted
in
this
very
area
to
give
the
federal
agency
preemptive
authority
when
it
deems
that
authority
appropriate;
and
as
the
federal
government
says--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
did
so,
though,
your
honor
in
49
u.s.c.
20106,
where
it
said
that
unless
and
until
the
federal
government
issues
a
regulation
in
a
particular
field,
the
states
are
allowed
to
have
their
rule
be
in
effect.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
that's
why,
justice
ginsburg,
the
point
here
is
how
broadly
do
you
define
the
scope
of
the
field,
and
napier
defined
it
in
an
historical
context
that
we
just
don't
live
in
any
more;
and
there
is
no
reason
to
give
manufacturers
a
complete
pass
from
liability
when
they
have
the
best
information
to
advise
railroad
--
railroads
and
railroad
workers
how
to
work
on
their
equipment
in
a
safe
way
without
exposing
their
workers
to
unnecessary
risks.
thank
you.
