mr.
john
f.
preis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
a
federal
prisoner's
access
to
constitutional
remedies
should
turn
on
the
mere
happenstance
of
where
the
prisoner
is
detained.
the
petitioner's
chief
argument
is
that
privately-held
federal
prisoners
should
not
have
an
eighth
amendment
damages
remedy
because
they
have
damages
under
state
law.
this
argument
suffers
from
two
flaws.
first,
it
misconceives
this
court's
bivens
jurisprudence;
second,
it
misconceives
the
nature
of
state
remedies
available
to
prisoners.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
claims
that
can't
be
vindicated
under
state
law,
we
think
its
likely
that
his
medical
malpractice
claims,
the
claims
against
the
doctors,
could
be
vindicated.
we
don't
think
the
law
is
clear
in
--
excuse
me
--
in
california
that
his
other
claims,
the
deprivation,
nutrition,
hygiene,
forced
labor
at
some
point
before
his
injuries
were
healed,
that
those
would
necessarily
be
covered.
we
admit
there
is
a
chance,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
it's
possible
the
california
supreme
court
could
say,
well,
there
has
been
an
intermediate
appellate
court
that
has
decided
this.
we
take
on
guidance
that
and
believe
these
remedies
would
be
covered.
but
there
is
nothing
here
that
could
assure
this
court
that
that's
the
way
it
will
work
out.
with
regards
to
why
bivens
are
superior,
bivens
are
superior
when
there
is
no
state
cause
of
action.
so
there
will
be
some
cases,
as
we
concede,
where
a
state
cause
of
action
is
available.
the
reason
mr.
pollard
brings
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
this
case
is
because
it's
not
clear
that
state
remedies
are
certainly
available.
and
i
think
that
certainty
is
an
important
thing
for
this
court
to
remember.
the
issue
before
bivens
itself
was
whether
or
not
this
court
should
adopt
a
system
of
state
remedies.
and
the--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor
i'm
not
aware
of
any
particular
case
where
a
state--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--the
claims
that
we
say
do
not
have--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
starkest
example,
if
it
was
the
case
that
somebody
actually
starved
someone--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--oh,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
preis
okay.
mr.
john
f.
preis
he
brings
four
claims
that
he
think
alleges
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
one
is
the
medical
malpractice
which
we
concede
is
likely
available;
the
other
three,
we
do
not
find
sufficient
evidence
in
california
law
that
there
certainly
be
a
remedy.
mr.
john
f.
preis
and
those
three
are--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--understood,
your
honor.
mr.
pollard
was
deprived
of
adequate
food
and
hygiene.
a
second
claim,
he
was--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--well,
yes,
adequate
nutrition.
i'm
not
saying
to
the
point
of
death,
but--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--i'm
saying
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
it--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
think
--
i
would
put
--
i
think
the
best
way
to
approach
that
question
is
to
look
at
the
shoes
of
an
attorney.
when
if
someone
comes
in
and
says
i
was
deprived
of
these
benefits
that
i
was
entitled
to
and
i
was
suffered
a
harm,
the
question
would
be
for
the
lawyers,
well,
i'll
go
read
the
case--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--no,
i
think
the
lawyer
would
say,
i
can't
be
certain.
i
haven't
found
a
case--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
the
other
claims
were
after
he
suffered
his
injuries
he
was
put
back
on
his
work
detail
before
his
injuries
were
healed.
he
was
also
immediately
after
being
injured
forced
to
sort
of
endure
excessive
security
measures,
forced
to
wear
particular
handcuffs
that
pushed
his
arms
in
an
--
in
a
way
that
would
cause
extraordinary
pain
and
was
unnecessary.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
two
parts
to
that,
two
answers
i
would
give.
first,
mr.
pollard
was
put
in
a
federal
prison
by
the
federal
government.
he
often
has
access
--
actually
only
has
access
to
federal
law
books.
when
he
sees
himself
injured
he
thinks
this
is
presumably
a
federal
case.
so
i
think
there
is
a
certain
ethic
or
at
least
practice
as
how
that
works.
now,
why
wouldn't
medical
malpractice
work
here.
mr.
john
f.
preis
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
missed
the
beginning.
mr.
john
f.
preis
well
we
think
that
prisoners
should
have
access
to
the
state
law
action,
and
when
there
is
cause
of
action
available,
it
might
indeed
be
a
better
remedy.
but
i
think
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
medical
malpractice
works
here,
it
will
work
in
terms
of
deterring
the
medical
professionals,
but
we
have
multiple
defendants
in
this
case,
not
all
of
them
--
of
which
would
be
culpable
under
--
or
liable
under
a
medical
malpractice
regime.
how
do
we
handle
the
other
prisoners
--
excuse
me,
the
other
defendants?
so
i
think
you're
focused
in
terms
of
the
remedies
available,
and
i
would
concede,
of
course,
that's
important
to
the
--
to
the
prisoner;
but
course,
the
court
is
concerned
with
deterrence
in
these
cases.
so
i
want
to
return
to
justice
breyer's
question
if
i
might.
the
gravamen
of
this
case
is
that
in
ordinary
cases,
most
of
the
time,
and
the
court
is
required
in
this
case
to
figure
how
big
is
that
"most
of
the
time"?
is
it
99
percent
of
time,
is
it
80
percent
of
the
time?
and
that's
what
we
simply
don't
have
i
want
to
point--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
guess
your--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--no
--
your
honor,
i
will
say
two
things
that
--
first,
i
think
what
you
are
asking
me
to
do
and
in
a
sense
what
the
court
will
be
required
to
do
in
this
case
is
predict
what
state
supreme
courts
will
do
on
a
regular
basis.
and
i
would
suggest
--
suggest
that's
sort
of
an
extraordinary
measure
to
take
in
case
where
you
have
federal
prisoners,
federal
constitutional
rights
and
federal
actors.
mr.
john
f.
preis
excuse
me?
mr.
john
f.
preis
i
don't--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--they
are
suggesting
this
court
look
only
at
california.
mr.
john
f.
preis
we
don't
think
that
is
appropriate.
this
court's
view
has
always
been
that
a
bivens
action
exists
or
does
not
exist
with
regards
to
a
entire
category
of
defendants,
or
context.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
john
f.
preis
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
write
an
opinion
in
that
case--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--i'm
not
surprised
that
you
wouldn't
want
to
hold
that,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
preis
well--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--well--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
the
view
that
there's
an
ordinary
duty
of
care,
a
duty
to
be
reasonable,
is
quite
a
bit
more
complex
than
the
petitioners
would
make
it
out
to
be.
let
me
offer
an
example.
in
this
case
in
2007,
the
district
court
dismissed
mr.
pollard's
complaint.
the
district
court
said
you
have
state
remedies.
well,
what
was
the
proof
for
that?
what
was
the
state
law
remedy
that
existed?
the
only
thing
the
district
court
cited
in
a
footnote
was
section
1714
of
california's
civil
code.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
this
court's
most
recent
case
where
it
dealt
with
whether
or
not
a
burden
should
exist
was
wilkie,
and
there,
the
majority
of
the
court
said
when
we
look
at
alternative
remedies
we
try
to
figure
out,
quote,
"whether
they
amount
to
a"
--
"amount
to
a
convincing
reason
for
the
judicial
branch
to
refrain
from
providing
a
new
and
free-standing
remedy.
"
inasmuch
as
there
has
been
burden
discussion
in
this
court's
case
law,
it
would
seem
to
fall
--
fall
on
the
other
side.
now,
i
think
there
is
an
important
point
here
when
we
think
of
burden.
this
case
is
so
close
to
carlson
that
really
the
burden
should
be
on
them
to
take
it
out
of
carlson.
i
want
to
address
carlson
for
a
second
if
i
may.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
seriously
disagree
with
the
suggestion
it's
a
distortion.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
what
the
court
was
speaking
of
in
that
section
of
its
opinion
was
that
the
remedies
between
a
bop
facility
and
individuals
in
a
private
facility
should
be
similar,
that
it
made
no
sense
to
give
extra
remedies
to
people
in
a
private
facility.
and
so
the
court,
justice
--
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
the
time
was
making
a
comparison
saying
there
should
be
a
general
symmetry.
and
all
we
were
pointing
out
in
that
quote
is
that
inasmuch
as
symmetry
matters,
well,
the
court
there
in
malesko
had
said,
well
we
would
likely
expect
there
to
be
an
individual
remedy.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
guess
i
certainly
took
part
of
the
quote
and
didn't
use
all
of
the
quote,
but
i
did
not
in
any
means
say--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--well,
your
honor,
i
guess
i
would
respectfully
differ.
mr.
john
f.
preis
i
think,
your
honor,
if
this
court
would
--
could
tell
with
confidence
that
states
in
all
states
provided
sufficient
remedies
for
the
entire
variety
of
eighth
amendment
violations,
this
court
would
be
certainly
wise
in
allowing
state
remedies
to
work.
but
i
think
we
are
far
from
that
situation.
i
want
to
turn,
if
i
may--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
could
you
repeat
that
question?
mr.
john
f.
preis
in
other
words,
the
prisoner
would
have
an
eighth
amendment
claim
but
not
a
tort--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
would
note
maryland,
for
example.
in
maryland,
attacks
by
a
prisoner
on
another
prisoner
are
evaluated
in
terms
of
the
liability
of
the
warden;
a
lot
evaluate
it
on
a
maliciousness
standard.
now,
the
standard
this
court
uses
in
its
acts
by
one
prisoner
against
another
is
a
deliberate
indifference
standard.
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
is
different.
we
are
not
arguing
in
this
case--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
preis
no,
it's
a
suit
against
the
warden
for
a
failure
to
protect
someone
against
attack
by
another
prisoner.
mr.
john
f.
preis
the
test
in
maryland
is
maliciousness,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
significant
difference
in
this
case.
for
instance,
california--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--oh,
i
understand.
mr.
john
f.
preis
i
think
there
will
be
some
cases
in
which
the
remedies
will
be
curtailed
under
state
law.
and
one
could
expect
that
the
deterrent
value
of
a
state
law
remedy
would
not
be
available.
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes
remaining
and
i
want
to
turn
to
carlson.
i
think
the
suggestion
in
this
--
the
discussion
that
we
have
had
so
far
is
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reach
out
and
create
an
extraordinary
cause
of
action.
i
simply
don't
think
that's
true.
this
case
is
very
similar,
if
not
the
same
as,
carlson.
in
carlson,
the
court
said
that
a
federal
prisoner
has
a
cause
of
action
against
federal
actors
for
a
federal
constitutional
right.
that's
what
this
case
is.
and
the
only
distinction
the
petitioners
can
point
to
is
the
fact
that
they
are
privately
employed
federal
actors
as
opposed
to
publicly
employed
federal
actors.
the
question
becomes,
is
"privately
employed"
federal
actor
a
meaningful
distinction
from
"publicly
employed"?
we
would
--
if
that
distinction
is
meaningful,
we
would
have
expected
to
find
some
discussion
of
it
in
malesko,
but
the
court
there
paid
absolutely
no
attention
to
the
private
status.
the
court
in
malesko
said
that
malesko,
that
case,
was
in
every
meaningful
sense
the
same
as
fdic
v.
meyer.
fdic
v.
meyer
was
a
suit
against
a
public
agency.
if
the
case
is
in
every
meaningful
sense
the
same
as
meyer,
then
it
must
have
been
what
mattered
to
the
court
in
malesko
was
that
it
was
a
suit
against
an
entity,
not
public
versus
private.
so
we
think
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
--
excuse
me
--
no
--
nothing
in
the
law
that
suggests
that
this
court
cares
and
ever
have
cared
the
distinction
between
public
and
private
remedies.
mr.
john
f.
preis
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
missed
the
first
part
of
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
preis
no
individual
remedy.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
carlson,
the
court
expressed
a
preference
for
an
individual
remedy
over
an
entity
remedy.
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
court
addressed
in
carlson
how
it
would
compare
to
individual
remedies.
that
issue
actually
came
up
in
bivens.
there
was
an
individual
remedy
proposed
that
would
be
available
under
state
law,
and
the
alternative
was
a
remedy
under
the
constitution
itself.
so
when
the
court
was
faced
with
two
alternative
individual
actions,
the
court
said
that
we
prefer
the
constitutional
cause
of
action.
and
the
reason
in
bivens
was
we
can't
be
certain
really
how
state
law
works.
mr.
john
f.
preis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
end
the
question
asks
me
to
make
a
50-state
assessment
of
how
state
law
works,
and
in
that
sense,
one
can
only
speak
in
generalizations--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--we
think,
inasmuch
as
a
cause
of
action
is
available,
with
the
exception,
as
the
court
noted,
of
damages
caps,
there
--
we
would
expect
to
have
a
similar
level
of
deterrence,
provided
the
damages
are
available.
mr.
john
f.
preis
we
would
expect
--
first
of
all,
obviously,
the
liability
is
imposed
on
the
individual.
we
would
expect
as
a
general
matter
that
there
would
be
indemnification
by
the
corporation.
the
question
then
is,
of
course,
whether
that
gets
passed
on
to
the
federal
government.
and
i
don't
think
it's
fair
--
if
the
court
allows
a
bivens
action
here,
i
think
there's
the
suggestion
that
all
of
a
sudden,
there'll
be
a
whole
new
realm
of
liability
and
costs.
and
that
is
simply
not
the
case--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
am
not
versed
in
the
indemnification
rules
of
private
prisons,
but
i
would
expect
that
there
will
be
some
instances
where
there
is
indemnification.
i
think
the
general
rule
in
terms
of--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
always
been
this
court's
presumption
that
actors,
legal
actors,
respond
to
the
standards
of
law
that
are
imposed.
i
can't
say--
mr.
john
f.
preis
--your
honor,
if
it's
the
case
that
there's
not
a
dime's
worth
of
difference,
that
would
only
be
at
this
point.
and
one
can
expect
state
law
to
change
over
time.
i
think
one
of
the
questions
propounded
to
mr.
franklin
or
mr.
shah
was,
what
if
the
state
imposed
a
--
or
created
absolute
immunity?
i
think
--
i
take
your
honor's
point
to
be
that
there
could
be
a
similarity
at
one
point.
and
we
agree
that
that
could
exist
for
a
particular
circumstance.
but
we
don't
think
this
court
should
take
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights
in
federal
prisons
with
regard
to
federal
actors
and
set
up
a
scheme
where
that
is
handled
through
state
law.
there
is
simply
not
a
justification
there.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
the
westfall
act.
they
argue
strenuously
that
congress
has
already
spoken
in
this
case,
and
that's
simply
not
the
case.
in
the
ft
--
put
it
this
way.
the
ftca
and
the
westfall
act
deal
only
with
federal
employees,
the
liability
of
federal
government
for
actions
of
federal
employees.
their
argument
is
essentially
that
congress
attempted
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
private
contractors
should
be
liable
in
these
situations
by
amending
a
statute
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
private
contractors.
and
that
simply
doesn't
work.
it's
not
--
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
congress
attempted
to
address
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
preis
your
honor,
the
court
--
excuse
me,
congress
did
not
make
a
reference
to
private
contractors
in
the
westfall
act.
they
simply,
congress
simply
referred
to
employees
of
the
united
states.
and
the
reason
the
court
--
excuse
me,
congress
referred
to
employees
of
the
united
states
was
because
the
ftca
only
applies,
and
has
always
only
applied
to
contractors
--
excuse
me,
of
employees
of
the
united
states.
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
reach
out
because
it
would
be
totally
beyond
the
specter
of
the
ftca
itself.
i
think,
your
honor,
there
is
something
else
to
note
with
regard
to
congress.
at
most,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
congressional
silence.
they
suggest
that
congress
is
fit
to
take
care
of
this.
nobody
doubts
that
congress
is
fit
to
step
in
and
take
care
of
this
at
some
point
in
time.
but
cong
--
this
court's
practice
with
regards
to
bivens
has
been
when
congress
steps
in,
to
stand
back.
but
here
we
have
congressional
silence.
as
this
--
as
the
court
said
in
2007,
it's
most
recent
bivens
case
was,
when
you
are
dealing
--
well,
excuse
me
--
the
wilkie
case
did
not
involve
any
specific
congressional
action.
the
court
viewed
it
essentially
as
congressional
silence.
the
majority
of
this
court
at
that
time
said
our
evaluation
in
that
instance
is
to
figure
out
--
excuse
me
--
whether
the
federal
courts
must
make
the
kind
of
remedial
determination
that
is
appropriate
for
a
common
law
tribunal.
the
court
at
that
point
saw
itself
as
that
point
as
a
common
law
tribunal
within
the
specific
circumstance
of
whether
or
not
a
bivens
remedy
should
be
available.
that's
not
to
say
the
court
should
adopt
some
sort
of
roving
common
law
power.
it's
simply
to
say
where
there's
congressional
silence
and
the
case
looks
almost
identical
to
carlson,
if
not
identical,
that
there
is
sufficient
reason
for
this
court
to
find
a
bivens
cause
of
action
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit.
