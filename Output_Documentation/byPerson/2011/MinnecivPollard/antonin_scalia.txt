justice
antonin
scalia
the
lawyer
would
say
i
can't
find
a
starving
case
in
california.
so
you
must
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
is
that
what
the
lawyer
would
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
have
besides
starving?
what
--
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
--
if
there
is
one
state
that
would
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
for
any
--
any
single
bad
thing
that
could
happen
in
prison,
there
is
a
bivens
action
for
everybody
for
everything?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
hold
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
who
says
that
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side?
why
isn't
the
burden
on
you,
if
you
want
to
bring
a
bivens
action,
on
you,
to
show
that
there
is
not
an
adequate
state
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
the
plaintiff
here,
you
are
trying
to
bring
the
federal
cause
of
action.
our
law
is
clear;
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
we
don't
invent
one.
why
isn't
it
your
burden
to
show
that
there
is
not
an
adequate
state
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
known
as
misquoting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
what
you
are
talking
about.
is
--
is
this
a
suit
against
the
prisoner
who
was
attacked?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
not
liable
unless
he
is
malicious,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
and
--
and
the
warden
is
liable
in
maryland,
you
say,
only
if
he
is
malicious?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
the
warden
of
a
maryland
prison
is
aware
that
if
--
if
he
allows
one
prisoner
to
beat
up
another
prisoner,
he
is
only
liable
for
maliciousness
and
not
for
deliberate
indifference
--
if
indeed
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two?
do
--
do
you
think
that
--
that
he
is
threading
the
needle
that
finely
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
deterrence
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
at
that
level
of
--
of
refinement.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
warden
knows
he's
subject
to
state
tort
law,
and
that
state
tort
law
renders
him
liable
for
negligence,
and
indeed
for
physical
assaults.
some
of
your
causes
of
action
are
intentional
torts,
not
even
negligence.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
as
far
as
deterrence
is
concerned,
there
is
a
dime's
worth
of
difference
between
state
law
and
--
and
the
bivens
action
you
are
asking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
us
to
hold
that
there
is
no
bivens
action
in
california?
is
that
--
is
that
what
our
opinion
is
going
to
say?
