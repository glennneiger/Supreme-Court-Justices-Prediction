justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
why
it
is
that
you,
you
care
in
this
suit?
if
you
are
telling
us,
oh,
don't
worry,
there's
going
to
be
liability
and
probably
perhaps
even
more
extensive
liability
than
bivens,
what
difference
does
it
make?
bivens
doesn't
give
you
attorneys
fees.
now,
it's
true
that
the
federal
question
may
get
you
into
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
are
looking
--
if
we
are
looking
forward
beyond
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
there
is
no
statute
of
limitation
problem,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
that
he
has
a
second
cause
of
action
that's
just,
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--duplicative
or,
b,
arguably
narrow,
more
narrow?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
difference
does
it
make?
