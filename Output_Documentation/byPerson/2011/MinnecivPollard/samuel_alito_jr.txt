justice
samuel
a.
alito,

to
get
back
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
asked,
is
that
consistent
with
carlson?
because
the
court
in
carlson
didn't
say
that
there
is
a
bivens
action
because
in
this
particular
state
there
isn't
a
viable
state
action,
but
it
might
be
different
in
another
state
where
there
is
a
viable
state
claim.
it
did
it
on
basically
a
categorical
ground.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
a
prisoner
in
a
state
that
requires
the
filing
of
a
certificate
of
merit
in
a
medical
malpractice
case
have
an
alternative
--
a
viable
alternative
state
claim--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
malpractice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
the
plra
--
under
the
plra,
a
district
judge
has
to
perform
a
screening
function
for
--
for
these
complaints,
and
is
that
--
is
it
going
to
be
an
impossible
burden
for
district
judges
to
ascertain
the
contours
of
state
prison
law,
in
that
there
apparently
is
not
a
lot
of
prisoner
litigation
under
state
law?
most
prisoners
seem
to
choose
1983.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
you
propose
that
the
court
say
about
the
degree
of
adequate
state
remedy
that
is
necessary?
just
--
what
we
have
here
in
california
is
enough
and
not
go
any
further
or--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
that
a
state
did
for
claims
against
private
prisons
and
private
prison
guards
what
i
understand
new
york
has
done
with
respect
to
state-run
prisons.
in
other
words,
that
you
eliminate
any
claim
against
individual
prison
employees
or
guards
and
give
the
prisoner
just
a
tort
claim
against
the
state.
would
that
be
adequate?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
a
claim
against
the
state.
i
misspoke.
a
claim
--
only
a
claim
against
the
company
that
runs
the
prison.
