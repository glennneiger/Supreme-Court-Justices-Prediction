justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
what
you
said
initially,
that
is
if
there's
no
alternative
remedy
bivens
fills
the
gap.
suppose
we
had
a
case
just
like
carlson,
only
the
state
law
allows
survivor
actions.
in
carlson,
i
thought
the
rule
emerging
from
carlson
is
that
prison
personnel
in
federal
prisons
are
subject
to
bivens
liability,
and
we
don't
look
in
each
case
to
see
whether
they
could
have
been
a
state
tort.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
franklin,
there
were
some
references
to
mississippi
law
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
all
states
would
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
then
it
might
hold
state
prisoners
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
might
hold
--
some
private
facilities
will
take
state
prisoners
as
well
as
federal
prisoners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
they
do
have
state
prisoners,
the
state
prisoner
would
have
recourse
to,
not
bivens,
but
1983.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
have
two
prisoners,
identical
mistreatment,
and
one
gets
a
federal
remedy
and
the
other
doesn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
any
of
those
courts
address
the
problem
of
how
the
pro
se
prisoner
is
going
to
get
an
affidavit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
go
back
to
what
you
said
about
lacking
these
private
--
these
employees
of
the
private
corporation
you
said
lack
qualified
immunity.
but
they
do
have
--
courts
have
allowed
them
to
have
a
good
faith
defense.
so
in
practice,
how
different
is
that,
whether
they
have
qualified
immunity
or
whether
they
have
a
good
faith
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
character
of
the
claim?
if
it's
a
bivens
claim
it's
a
constitutional
claim,
it's
an
eighth
amendment
claim.
and
if
you
are
looking
to
state
remedies,
that's
an
ordinary
tort
remedy
with
no
constitutional
involvement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
be
taking
the
position
that
even
if
there
is
an
alternative
state
remedy,
tort
remedy,
even
so,
there
ought
to
be
a
power
of
bivens
action?
or
would
you
say
no
bivens
action
if
all
of
the
states
have
adequate
tort
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
carlson,
it
was
bivens
or
no
damage
remedy.
here,
that's
not
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
carlson,
the
court
was
operating
on
the
theory
that
with
respect
to
the
federal
employees,
it
was
a
bivens
remedy
for
damages
or
no
remedy
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here,
it
is
different
from
carlson
because
there
is
an
--
a
remedy
against
an
individual.
so
we
have
the
parallel
remedies
here
which
didn't
exist
in
carlson,
and
that
makes
the
two
cases
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
was
the
purpose
of
making
the
reference
to
private
contractors
in
the
westfall
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
if
any
of
these
bivens
claims
have
been
pled
in
the
alternative,
that
is
the
bivens
remedy,
but
alternatively
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
diversity
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
--
ou
said
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
with
starting
new.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
if
there
is
diversity--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
allowing
an
amendment.
