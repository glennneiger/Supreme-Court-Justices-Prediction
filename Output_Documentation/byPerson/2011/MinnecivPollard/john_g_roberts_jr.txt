chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1104,
minneci
v.
pollard.
mr.
franklin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kagan.
if
--
if
i
heard
you
right,
you
were
saying,
well,
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
certificate
because
it's
an
eighth
amendment
violation
and
everything
is
very
severe.
but
the
point
is,
they
are
going
to
bring
a
negligence
action,
not
an
eighth
amendment
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
bivens
action
is
unusual
in
the
first
place,
but
it's
also
unusual
to
say
that
you
don't
have
a
federal
cause
of
action
because
of
something
a
state
gives
you.
do
you
have
any
other
example
of
something
like
that,
where
the
availability
of
federal
relief
turns
on
the
availability
of
alternative
relief
under
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
preis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
before
you
do,
on
page
5
of
your
brief
you
say,
in
the
private
prison
setting,
quote,
"a
bivens
claim
against
the
offending
individual
offending
officer.
"
end
quote,
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
and
the
quote
is
from
malesko.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
we
said
in
malesko,
where
you
quote,
is
that
if
a
federal
prisoner
in
a
bop
facility
alleges
a
constitutional
deprivation,
he
may
bring
a
bivens
claim
against
the
offending
individual
officer.
now
your
friend
describes
that
as
a
distortion
of
what
we
said
in
malesko,
and
i
just
wanted
to
give
you
a
chance
to
reply
to
what
i
think
is
a
fairly
serious
assertion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
to
be
clear.
you
quote
that
language,
you
say
bop
facility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
expect
the
same
rule.
that's
your
argument--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
apply
in
the
private
prison
setting.
what
you
say
is
that
there,
we
explained,
that
in
the
private
prison
setting,
a
bivens
claim
against
the
offending
individual
officer
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
medical
malpractice
caps?
is
that
an
issue?
in
other
words,
state
law
--
i
don't
know
how
many
there
are;
i
know
it's
been
proposed.
i
think
it's
true
in
some
cases
--
will
cap
your
recovery
for
medical
malpractice
at
a
particular
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
that
was
a
helpful
question,
in
the
sense
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
bivens
action,
presumably
the
cap
would
not
apply.
but
it
applies
under
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
disagree
that
the
--
i
know
you
have
your
argument
on
compensation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
with
respect
to
deterrence,
is
there
any
significant
difference
between
the
two
causes
of
action?
in
other
words,
if
you
think
the
most
significant
aspect
of
bivens
is
to
deter
constitutional
violations,
doesn't
that
work
equally
as
well
or
perhaps
more
effectively
under
the
state
law
than
under
bivens?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
--
your
answer
is
the
same
as
under
compensation,
that
the
state
law
might
be
different
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
--
who
actually
ends
up
paying
in
these
bivens
actions?
i
mean,
what
we
don't
know
--
is
it
the
federal
government
or
an
individual
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
just
looking
in
terms
of
the
practical
deterrence.
the
problem
i've
had
with
it
in
general,
i
don't
know
how
much
practical
deterrence
there
is,
is
if
you
sue
the
individual
and
the
--
the
individual
doesn't
actually
pay,
the
government
does.
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
more
likely
in
the
private
context
that
the
individual
may
get
stuck
with
some
amount
of
a
liability
if
the
employer
just
says,
look,
you
were
off
doing
something
you
weren't
supposed
to
do;
we
are
not
going
to
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
franklin,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1104,
minneci
versus
pollard.
