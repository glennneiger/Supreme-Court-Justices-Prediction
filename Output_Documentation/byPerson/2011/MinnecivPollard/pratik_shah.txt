mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
last
3
decades
of
this
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
judicial
extension
of
the
bivens
remedy
is
not
the
default
presumption.
it
is
permissible
only
where
there
is
no
adequate
alternative
remedy
and
there
are
no
other
factors
counseling
hesitation.
neither
criterion
is
satisfied
here.
respondent
is
suing
employees
of
a
private
prison
corporation
who,
unlike
their
federally
employed
counterparts,
are
subject
to
well-established
theories
of
tort
liability,
but
lack
a
recognized
qualified
immunity
defense.
under
the
circumstances
present
here,
which
i
submit
reflect
the
heartland
of
cases
alleging
eighth
amendment
violations
for
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs,
recognition
of
the
bivens
remedy
is
neither
necessary
nor
appropriate.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
a
couple
of
responses,
your
honor.
first,
this
court
has
never
recognized
a
good
faith
defense,
so
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
recognized
defense.
it
is
true
that
some
lower
courts
have
applied
a
good
faith
defense.
reading
those
cases,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
exactly
what
the
content
of
that
good
faith
defense
is.
what
is
clear
is
that
it
is
something
less
than
qualified
immunity.
it
appears
in
most
of
the
cases
that
they
are
grafting
on
some
sort
of
subjective
element,
subjective
intent
element,
on
top
of
what
you
must
establish
to
get
qualified
immunity.
so
whatever
it
is,
it
is
something
lesser
than
qualified
immunity,
and
i
think
that
in
and
of
itself
creates
an
asymmetry.
but
i
think
the
larger
point
is,
is
that
these
prisoners
have
alternative
adequate
remedies
under
state
law
because
they
are
suing
a
private
employee
rather
than
a
government
employee.
the
government
employee
is
subject
to
the
westfall
act
and
therefore
all
civil
actions
other
than
bivens
are
preempted.
so
i
think
that's
the
fundamental
difference.
i
think
it
further
counsels
hesitation
because
of
the
lack
of
a
recognized
immunity
defense,
whether
that's
qualified
immunity
or
good
faith.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
your
honor,
in
that
hypothetical
--
and
of
course,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
any
state
has
such
a
rule
--
but
if
a
state
were
to
adopt
that
such
rule,
i
think
that
would
be
a
case
where
there
is
no
adequate
alternative
remedy,
because
in
your
--
in
your
hypothetical,
there
is
absolute
immunity.
there
wouldn't
be
a
way
for
the
prisoner
to
redress
--
seek
redress
for
the
gravamen
of
his
injuries.
and
i
think
in
that
case,
we
have
a
very
different
situation
and
a
bivens
remedy
may
well
be
justified.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
yes,
your
honor,
except
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
suggestion
that
any
state
has
such
a
draconian
rule
or
has
ever
passed
one.
we
are
simply
arguing
for
a
rule
that
would
limit
bivens
when
there
is
no
adequate
state
law
remedy.
that
is
clearly
the
case
here.
it's
clearly
going
to
be
the
case
in
the
vast
majority
of
eighth
amendment
prisoners.
what
this
court
should
not
do
is
craft
a
default
rule
allowing
bivens
remedies
against
employees
of
private
prison
corporations
just
to
account
for
the
hypothetical
possibility
that
there
may
be
a
case
which
may
or
may
not
ever
arise
in
which
an
adequate
alternative
is
not.
that
turns
bivens
jurisprudence
on
its
head.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
precise
formulation.
i
think
the
formulation
that
we
use
in
our
brief
is
that
as
long
as
it
redressed
the
gravamen
of
the
prisoner's
injuries.
so
i
think
as
long
as
it
provides
some
meaningful
relief
for
the
injuries
and
in
turn
that
would
provide
some
deterrence
to
the
individual
employees'
actions,
i
think
as
long
as
those
two
elements
are
present,
i
think
we
would
think
that
there
is
an
adequate
alternative
remedy.
or,
alternatively,
if
you
wanted
to
use
the
words
--
the
word
that
this
court
used
in
bivens,
you
could
approach
it
from
the
flip
side
and
say
there
would
not
be
an
adequate
alternative
remedy
where
the
state
law
is
either
inconsistent
with
or
hostile
to
the
corresponding
constitutional
interest.
we
submit
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
remedies
available
under
california
state
law
and
as
far
as
we
know
the
state
law
of
every
other
state
in
this
country
that
would
allow--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
it
may
not
be
an
exact
analog,
but
i
think
federal
due
process
cases
often
will
look
at
someone's
claims
of
deprivation
of
property,
an
unlawful
deprivation
of
property
in
violation
of
process.
the
federal
court
may
often
look
at
whether
the
available
state
law
procedures
to
provide
redress
for
that
claim
before
it
would
impose
or
find
a
violation
of
federal
due
process.
so
i
think
there
are
analogs
where
federal
courts
do
look
at
the
availability
of
state
law
remedies
and
look
at
their
adequacy
before
determining
whether
a
federal
law
remedy
is
necessary.
and
this
court
has
done
that.
and
the
court
did
it
in
malesko,
i
think
is
the
best
example
in
the
bivens
context
of
where
the
court
looked
at
alternative
state
remedies
and
said
that,
hey
look,
the
availability
of
these
other
remedies
counsel
against
the
imposition
of
the
bivens
remedy.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
two
responses,
your
honor.
while
i
agree
the
separation
of
powers
problem
is
much
more
heightened
when
congress
acts,
i
think
there
is
still
a
separation
of
powers
issue
even
when
congress
has
not
acted.
that
is,
the
court
should
be
hesitant
before
--
before
implying
a
judicial
cause
of
action
for
damages
under
the
constitution,
given
that
it's
typically
been
congress's
province
to
do
so.
but
beyond
that,
the
rationales
--
there
have
been
two
rationales
that
have
been
given
by
this
court
in
its
bivens
jurisprudence
for
implying
such
a
remedy.
one
is
the
need
to
provide
some
meaningful
relief.
we
submit
when
there
is
an
alternative
state
remedy,
that
rational
has
been
satisfied.
the
other
rationale
this
court
has
offered
is
provide
some
deterrent
to
the
actions
of
an
individual
employee
or
officer.
we
also
submit
that
when
there
is
a
state
tort
damages
remedy
available,
that
rationale
too
will
be
accomplished.
the
three
occasions
in
which
this
court
has
recognized
the
bivens
remedy,
bivens
itself,
davis
and
carlson,
those
two
factors
were
not
present.
there
was
either
no
alternative
remedy
at
all
or
at
least,
as
in
carlson,
no
alternative
remedy
against
the
individual
officer.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
the
court
should
start
with
that.
certainly
here
there
hasn't
been
any
dispute
that
there
would
be
--
any
real
serious
dispute
that
there
would
be
an
adequate
alternative
remedy.
i
think
the
court
could
also
say
that
as
long
as
the
adequate
alternative
remedy
addresses
the
gravamen
of
the
prisoner's
injuries,
that
should
be
sufficient.
and
i
think
it
could
give
content
to
that
by
looking
at
the
two
rationales
this
court
has
offered
for
bivens.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
that
would
be
a
tougher
case.
and,
of
course,
i
assume
in
your
hypothetical
that
that's
--
that
that
would
also
apply
to
federal
prisoners
and
federally
contracted
prisons,
and
it's
difficult
to
figure
out
what
the
state's
interests--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
again
i
think
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
hypothetical
because
the
rational
about
individual
deterrence
of
the
individual
officer
may
not
be
as
strong
in
that
hypothetical.
but
once
again,
no
state
has
such
a
rule
and
it's
difficult
to
imagine
a
state's
incentive
to
adopt
such
a
rule
because
it's
not
coming
out
of
the
state's
pockets.
these
are
federally
contracted
prisons,
contracted
by
bop
and
run
by
private
prison
corporations.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
it
is
true,
the
labels
are
different
and
there's
going
to
be
different
meaning
to
those
remedies.
but
from
the
prisoner's
standpoint,
the
rationale
behind
bivens
was
to
provide
some
damages
relief.
from
the
prisoner's
standpoint
it's
not
going
to
matter,
i
would
submit,
whether
or
not
those
damages
are
procured
under
state
law
or
under
a
constitutionally
implied
action.
thank
you.
