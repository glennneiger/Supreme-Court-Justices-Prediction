justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
address
the
question
posed
earlier
of
what
were
to
happen
if
there
was
a
state
law
that
gave
absolute
immunity
to
these
private
correctional
officers
and
that
was
the
case
before
us.
this
particular
state,
it's
undisputed,
would
not
permit
any
kind
of
intentional
or
negligence
suit
against
these
officers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
interesting,
because
what
you
are
proposing
is
a
sort
of
state
by
state,
circuit
by
circuit,
presumably
existence
of
a
bivens
claim
or
not.
that
--
that
is
really
the
outcome
of
your
position.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
i
guess
the
question
is,
yes,
when
you
talk
about
an
overlap
of
remedies,
we
have
said
that
it
doesn't
need
to
be
a
matching
one
to
one
remedy,
but
you
do
need
some
degree
of
meaningful
overlap,
don't
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
--
define
how
much
or
how
do
we
describe
the
adequacy
of
that
order?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
are
state
remedies
--
what
of
your
clients'
claims
could
not
be
vindicated
under
state
law?
and
why
is
a
bivens
action
superior
to
a
negligence
action
in
california?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--limit
our
inquiry
to
california?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
limit
it
to
california.
what
--
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they're
saying
don't
look
at
what
other
courts
will
do,
just
look
at
the
state
you
are
in,
the
place
you
are
going
to
make
your
claim
and
figure
out
whether
your
claims
are
covered
or
not
covered
essentially
in
those
--
in
that
state.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
