justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
specific
case
with
state
remedies
is
not
available
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no.
your
allegation,
which
you
believe
states
a
valid
claim
under
bivens
action
but
not
under
state
law
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
understand
specifically
what
they
are.
i
mean
it
sounds
to
me
that
if
a
person,
a,
deliberately
starves
somebody
to
death,
for
example,
or
deliberately
gives
him
something
which
will
make
him
sick
when
he
eats
it,
that
that
would
at
least
be
negligence
and
would
arise
under
ordinary
state
tort
law.
so
i'm
curious
to
know
what
your
claim
is
that
does
not
arise
under
ordinary
state
tort
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
don't
answer
my
--
forget
my
hypothetical.
tell
me
your
specific
claim
that
does
not
arise
under
state
tort
law,
that's
all
i
want
to
know,
which
is
the
same
question
i
heard
--
i
just
didn't
hear
the
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
heard
the
answer
in
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
specifically
what
you
say
they
did
to
your
client
that
doesn't
make
out
a
state
tort
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
heard
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is
physically
you
say
the
defendant
did
to
your
client,
so
that
i
can
evaluate
your
statement
that
california
gives
no
tort
remedy
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i
don't
mind
to
sound
irritated
but
i
just
have
trouble
getting
my
question
across.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
they
failed
to
give
him
adequate
food
for
what?
so
he
could
live,
or
for
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
gave
him
--
and
if
a
person
in
california
who
has
charge
of
--
of
a
ward
or
someone
fails
adequately
to
nourish
that
ward,
you
are
saying
california
tort
law
gives
no
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--cause
like
negligence,
you
give
a
remedy.
it's
not
negligent;
it's
deliberate?
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
--
because
the
eighth
amendment
says
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
so
you
have
to
have
a
cruel
treatment
and
where
a
person
deliberately
or
negligently
subjects
someone
else
to
cruel
treatment,
my
--
my
law
school
recollection
of
many
years
ago
is
that
there
ordinarily
is
a
tort
action.
so,
so
--
that's
what
i
would
like
you
--
i'm
suspicious
of
your
statement
that
there
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore,
i
ask
for
some
elaboration
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
i
went
to
law
school,
evidence
on
in
this
case.
which
was
many
years
ago,
instead
of
talking
about,
like,
starvation
cases
or
medical
malpractice,
they
talked
about
a
general
thing
called
negligence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
seemed
to
apply
to
doctors,
and
then
it
was
medical
malpractice,
and
it
applied
to
others,
and
--
and
is
there
something
here
that
wouldn't
fall
in
that
general
kind
of
rubric,
or
the
general
terms
of
california
tort
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
know,
i
don't
want
you
just
to
repeat
yourself.
so
i
guess
i
have
the
best
answer
i
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
find
that
rather
surprising,
too,
actually.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
--
i
think
what
they're
asking
to
do
is
fine.
on
their
theory
you
have
no
problem,
because
you
go
back
and
show
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
remedy
in
california
for
shackling
a
person
--
i
guess
deliberately,
with
knowledge
that
that
would
cause
severe
pain,
and
if
you
can
show
that,
then
you
are
going
to
have
your
bivens
action
in
respect
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
that
--
what
they
are
saying
is
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
show
that,
so
it
doesn't
worry
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
famous
case
called
bivens
versus
six
unknown
fed.
narcotics
agents,
this
court
held
that
a
federal
agent’s
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
a
federal
government
employee,
namely,
the
one
who
violated
the
fourth
amendment
and
caused
some
harm.
subsequently,
this
court
held
that
a
government
employee's
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
sometimes
the
fifth
amendment
can
also
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
the
government
employee.
but
the
court
has
also
held
in
various
other
circumstances,
the
eighth
amendment,
the
fifth
amendment,
the
first
amendment
do
not
give
rise
to
a
bivens
type
action
for
damages.
well,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
a
prisoner
can
bring
a
bivens
action
for
damages
when
the
prisoner
seeks
to
bring
an
eighth
amendment
claim
based
upon
prison
officials'
deliberate
indifference
to
the
harm
caused
by
their
improper
medical
care,
he
says
that
violates
the
eighth
amendment,
and
when
the
prisoner
brings
that
claim
not
against
a
government
employee
but
against
a
private
employee
of
a
private
company
that
manages
a
federal
prison.
we
conclude
that
in
these
circumstances,
he
cannot,
not.
we
cannot
read
the
constitution
as
providing
a
bivens
remedy
in
those
circumstances.
our
basic
reason
is
that
in
this
kind
of
case,
the
prisoner
does
not
really
need
this
kind
of
federal
remedy
for
a
state
tort
law
provides
the
prisoner
with
an
adequate
remedy.
in
an
earlier
case,
wilkie
v.
robbins,
we
said
that
we
would
decide
whether
to
imply
a
bivens
action
from
the
constitution
through
a
two-step
test.
the
first
step,
we
said,
consists
of
asking
whether
any
alternative
existing
process
for
protecting
a
constitutional
interest
amounts
to
a
convincing
reason
for
the
judicial
branch
to
refrain
from
providing
a
new
and
freestanding
damage
remedy,
i.e.,
the
bivens
action.
in
this
instance,
we
stop
at
that
first
step.
state
tort
law
provides
this
prisoner
with
a
damage
remedy
for
the
kinds
of
injury
that
he
claims
he
suffered.
the
existence
of
that
remedy
in
the
circumstance
should
deter
constitutional
violation.
it
should
also
provide
adequate
compensation
to
the
victim
and
we
are
aware
of
no
special
reasons
to
imply
the
existence
of
an
additional
bivens
remedy
and
so,
we
don’t
do
so.
we
explain
our
reasons
in
greater
detail
in
our
opinion.
we
discuss
the
contrary
arguments
and
we
leave
for
a
future
day,
the
determination
of
whether
we
should
imply
a
bivens
remedy
should
there
arise
other
first
--
eighth
amendment
cases
which
unlike
the
cases
of
the
kind
before
us,
state
tort
law
does
not
provide
so
adequate
a
remedy.
we
reverse
the
contrary
determination
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justice
thomas,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
