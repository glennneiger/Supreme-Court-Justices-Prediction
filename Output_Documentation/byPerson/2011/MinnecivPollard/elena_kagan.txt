suppose,
mr.
franklin,
that
there
weren't.
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
a
good
case
about
california
law
here.
but
suppose
we
were
in
a
state
where
the
law
was
very
different
from
what
california's
law
appears
to
be,
where
there
was
no
special
duty
recognized
for
jailors,
and
indeed
where
the
basic
negligence
tort
was
unavailable
to
inmates
because
there
was
a
finding
of
--
a
holding
of
the
state
supreme
court
that
there
was
no
duty
on
the
part
of
jailors
to
inmates.
what
would
happen
then?
justice
elena
kagan
but
is
your
answer--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
franklin,
do
you
have
a
theory
about
why
these
are
brought
as
bivens
claims?
it
seems
mysterious
to
me.
if
you
bring
it
as
a
negligence
claim,
you
get
a
lower
standard
of
liability,
negligence
versus
deliberate
indifference.
you
get
vicarious
liability.
so
i
have
been
trying
to
puzzle
out,
why
aren't
these
brought
as
negligence
claims
rather
than
as
bivens
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
to
go
back
to
what
i
asked
before
when
i
hypothesized
a
state
that
didn't
have
adequate
remedies,
and
you
said
--
well,
just
to
pin
down
what
you
said,
if
there
were
no
adequate
remedies
there
would
be
a
bivens
action
available?
justice
elena
kagan
how
is
a
prisoner
supposed
to
satisfy
that
requirement?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
the
question,
mr.
franklin,
is
really
just
a
practical
one--
justice
elena
kagan
--which
is
how
a
pro
se
person
sitting
in
prison
is
supposed
to
have
access
to
a
doctor
who
will
provide
this
certificate.
and,
i
mean,
maybe
there
would
be
means,
but
i'm
asking
whether
there
would
be.
justice
elena
kagan
what
is
the
theory
behind
that,
mr.
shah?
i
mean
there
is
an
obvious
theory
when
congress
has
provided
an
alternative
remedial
system,
which
is
a
separation
of
powers
theory.
but
what's
the
theory
about
looking
to
state
law
for
these
kinds
of
alternative
remedies?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
mr.
franklin?
because
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
the
gravamen
of
this
claim
is
a
medical
malpractice
claim.
why
aren't
your
state
law
remedies
better?
you
have
vicarious
liability
and
all
you
have
to
prove
is
negligence.
why
wasn't
this
brought
as
a
state
law
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
well
that
was
just
false
consciousness
that
we
can
correct,
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
if
the
--
if
the
true
appropriate
remedy,
and
the
better
remedy
from
your
client's
point
of
view,
is
a
state
law
action,
we
should
just
say
bring
a
state
law.
justice
elena
kagan
could
you
give
me
your
best
example
of
a
state
tort
rule
that
would
prevent
a
prisoner
from
bringing
an
eighth
amendment
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
your
best
example
of
a
tort
rule
from
any
state
that
would
preclude
a
--
a
valid
eighth
amendment
claim.
justice
elena
kagan
you
have
50
states'
worth
of
tort
law
to
--
as
your
playground,
and
i
want
to
know
what
tort
rule
would
keep
a
prisoner
with
a
valid
eighth
amendment
claim
--
would
prevent
him
from
recovering?
