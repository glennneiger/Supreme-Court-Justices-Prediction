mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
over
the
last
3
decades,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
bivens
remedies
are
disfavored
and
will
only
be
authorized
in
narrow
situations
where
there
are
no
adequate
alternative
means
for
redressing
a
plaintiff's
injuries
and
no
other
factor
counsels
hesitation.
respondent
has
satisfied
neither
criteria.
he
has
not
shown
that
he
lacked
a
traditional
tort
remedy
for
the
injuries
of
which
he
complains,
and
petitioners'
status
as
employees
of
a
private
contractor
rather
than
the
government
at
a
minimum
gives
rise
to
factors
counseling
hesitation.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
the
rule--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
the
rule
--
the
carlson
rule
still
applies,
your
honor,
because
that
involved
actual
federal
government
employees.
and
since
carlson,
congress
has
preempted
all
tort
claims
against
them.
so
whether
indiana
law
now,
which
has
been
amended,
but
whether
indiana
law
provides
a
remedy
or
doesn't
is
immaterial,
because
congress
has
preempted
all
tort
claims
against
actual
employees
of
the
government.
but
these
--
this
case
involves
--
the
petitioners
are
not
employees
of
the
government.
they
are
employees
of
a
private
contractor.
and
under
the
westfall
act,
what
congress
did
was
preempt
all
claims
against
actual
government
officials
while
preserving
bivens
remedies.
but
it
did
the
opposite
for
employees
of
private
contractors.
for
them
there
are
adequate
alternative
tort
remedies.
and
it's
virtually
undisputed
in
this
case
that
there
was
such
a
remedy
here.
and
they
are
deliberately
--
congress
expressly
excluded
them
from
the
category
of
employees
against
whom
it
preserved
bivens
remedies.
so
yes,
in
the
carlson
situation,
there
is
still
a
bivens
claim
because
congress
has
expressly
preserved
that.
but
here
we
have
a
different
congressional
policy
that
we
are,
in
effect,
asking
the
court
to
embrace
here.
what
congress
did
in
the
westfall
act
is
it
said
what
in
effect
we
are
asking
this
court
to
recognize
and
what
we
believe
the
court
has
recognized
in
cases
like
malesko,
and
that
is,
where
there
are
adequate
alternative
tort
--
excuse
me,
where
there
are
no
adequate--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--in
that
hypothetical
instance
--
and
we
do
think
it's
hypothetical
--
we
think
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
the
court
could
in
that
circumstance
say
there
were
no
adequate
alternative
remedies.
but
the
reason
we
think
it's
entirely
hypothetical
is
there
has
nothing
been
shown
in
the
briefing
of
this
court
and,
as
the
ninth
circuit
dissenters
made
clear,
that
any
state
doesn't
afford
the
bedrock
cause
of
negligence.
and
that
cause,
as
the
court
held
in
malesko
quite
expressly,
is
not
only
adequate
to
redress
any
actions
that
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment,
but
it's
actually
superior.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
believe
that
reference,
if
i
am
correct,
comes
from
an
amicus
brief,
and
that
law
does
not
--
would
not
on
its
face
prohibit
an
action
against
a
private
managed
prison
holding
federal
prisoners.
these
laws
--
and
the
mississippi
law
is
an
example;
there
is
a
new
york
law
--
those
apply
to
state
government
officials.
they
are
similar
to
the
westfall
act,
but
on
a
state
level.
they
immunize
state
government
officials
from
claims,
but
those
claims
would
be
subject
to
1983
actions.
here
we
have
a
privately
managed
prison
holding
federal
prisoners.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
has
been
some
representation,
that
we
don't
disagree
with,
that
there
might
be
some
facilities
that
have
state
prisoners
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--most
likely,
your
honor,
yes,
if
it's
under--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
other
actually
gets
what
the
court
in
malesko
described
as
a
superior
remedy.
the
prisoner
--
the
federal
prisoner
has,
in
that
sense,
a
remedy
that's
beyond
the
eighth
amendment,
that
goes--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
i
have
several
answers
to
that.
first,
your
honor,
my
clients
care
very
deeply
in
this
case
because,
as
the
district
court
held,
if
there
is
no
bivens
remedy
this
case
is
dismissed.
this
case
was
dismissed
on
the
lack
of
a
bivens
remedy.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it's
way
too
late
now,
10
years
after
the
incident,
for
them
to
now
assert
a
state
law
claim.
so
we
do
care.
and
in
fact
that
was
the
same
situation
that
was
in
malesko.
in
malesko
you
had
a
virtually
identical
situation,
where
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
makes
a--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
two
points.
i'd
like
to
first
say
that
the
court
in
malesko
adopted
the
principle
that
if
there
is
an
alternative
remedy
that's
not
a
reason
for
piling
on
a
federal
remedy;
that's
a
reason
not
to.
but
in
a
practical
sense--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--let
me
give
you
a
practical
difference
that
it
does
matter
for
individuals
in
my
clients'
situation.
if
a
state
tort
claim
is
brought,
there
is
respondeat
superior
liability
under
a
state
court
claim.
and
in
many,
if
not
most
cases,
the
plaintiff
will
choose,
voluntarily
choose
to
sue
the
corporation
and
leave
the
individual
out
of
the
case.
now,
the
deterrent
effect
that
bivens
is
concerned
with
still
exists
because
the
case
can
be
brought
against
the
individual.
however,
if
there
is
a
bivens
claim,
that
has
to
be
brought
against
the
individual;
it
cannot
be
brought
under
respondeat
superior.
so
if
there
is
a
bivens
claim,
as
a
practical
matter
you
are
going
to
see
more
and
more
individuals
being
dragged
through
these
cases
without,
by
the
way,
the
recognized
qualified
immunity
defense--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
can't
answer
that
question.
what
i
can
say
--
well,
i
can
try
to
answer,
but
i
can
say
that
if
the
court
rules
as
we
ask
it
to
in
this
case,
we
think
that
there
will
not
be
bivens
claims,
that
people
will
bring
them
under
the
tort
law.
it
could
be
there
are
forms
in
some
of
these
prisons
that
are
given
out
that
have
section
1983
written
on
them,
that
bivens
is
there.
it
could
be
that
prisoners
are
not
quite
aware
that
the
westfall
act
doesn't
cover
private
contractors.
but
we
would
think
if
the
court
rules
as
we
suggest
it
should,
that
the
--
that
the
prisoners
who
are
relatively
savvy,
even
on
a
pro
se
basis,
about
their
rights
would
then
understand
that
they
have
these
rights
and
will
exercise
them
and
that
the
bivens
remedy
would
not
have
been
to
be
employed
willy-nilly
as
it
was
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
might
be,
your
honor.
there
still
is
the
factors
counseling
hesitation,
which
is
the
second
step
of
the
bivens
analysis.
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
give
up
that
there
might
be
factors
in
those
cases
counseling
hesitation.
but
certainly
our
position
is
not
that
--
in
a
circumstance,
if
that
arose,
and
again
we
think
that's
hypothetical
because
there
is
no
indication
either
that
it
has
arisen
or
that
it
will
arise,
but
if
it
were
to,
our
position
wouldn't
rule
out
the
possibility
of
a
bivens
claim
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
as
the
case
came
to
the
court
in
carlson,
it
was
undisputed
that
there
was
no
adequate
state
law
remedy,
the
lower
courts
had
held.
so
that
was
sort
of
the
basic
premise
that
the
court
then
went
ahead
and
decided
the
case
on.
since
carlson,
we've
had
cases,
notably
malesko
and
also
wilkie,
which
have
made
clear
that
the
adequacy
of
remedies,
including
state
law
remedies,
is
a
factor
in
the
bivens
analysis
and
is
in
fact
the
dispositive
factor
in
malesko,
as
in
this
case
as
well.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
really
any
serious
dispute
in
this
case
that
there
were
adequate
alternative
remedies.
again,
the
deliberate
indifference
standard
is
much,
much
more
hard
--
much
harder
to
meet
than
a
traditional
negligence
standard.
california
law
is,
further,
more
protective
of
prisoners.
as
we
understand
the
respondents'
position,
the
court
--
they
would
urge
the
court,
notwithstanding
the
availability
of
alternative
remedies
in
this
case
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
in
every
foreseeable
case,
to
create
what
they
refer
to
as
a
categorical
cause
of
action,
one
that
would
apply
regardless
of
whether
the
remedies
are
adequate
or
not.
and
in
our
view,
that
would
turn
the
bivens
jurisprudence
effectively
on
its
head.
the
court
has
said
bivens
is
a
narrow
--
i
think
justice
ginsburg
at
least
paraphrased
our
argument
as
saying
it's
a
gap-filling
mechanism,
which
is
what
our
argument
is
--
that
would
apply
only
in
those
circumstances
when
it's
necessary.
other
than
that,
the
court
has
consistently
deferred
the
matter
to
congress.
and
that's
where
we
think
it
ought
to
lie
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
again,
that's--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--we
say
yes.
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
alba
expressly
addressed
that
issue
under
that
state's
law,
and
said
yes,
that
is
adequate.
it's
simply
a
procedural
requirement
that
applies
to
all
plaintiffs.
and
i
would
add,
by
the
way,
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
same
way
any
other
plaintiff
is
supposed
to.
what
i
was
going
to
add
is
that
when
you
are
alleging
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
you
are
talking
about
a
claim
that
by
its
nature
is
very
severe.
you
are
talking
about
deliberate
indifference
to
serious
medical
needs
that
constitutes
the
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain.
in
those
circumstances,
we
would
suggest
that
it
might
even
be
easier
to
procure
that
kind
of
declaration,
but
--
that
issue
was
decided
in
alba,
so
that
--
that
was
decided.
if
it
comes
up
in
another
case,
it
can
be
decided
there.
we
don't
think
that
that
would
render
the
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
an
adequate
remedy
for
everyone
else
in
that
state
and
most
states
that
have
these
things,
then
it's
an
adequate
remedy
for
bivens.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
alba
--
the
alba
court
is
--
is
the
only
court
that
i'm
aware
of
on
the
circuit
level
that's
considered
it.
and
i
believe
they
did
address
that
issue
and
simply
said
that
it
is
--
puts
them
on
an
equal
footing
with
other
plaintiffs,
and
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i'm
talking
about
if
the
conduct
--
we
are
comparing
here
between
conduct
that
would
violate
the
eighth
amendment
and
conduct
that
is
negligent,
and
i'm
saying
if
the
conduct
rises
to
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
adequacy,
then
it
would
be
easier,
one
would
presume.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
sure.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
would
think
there
would,
but
i
don't
want
to
say
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
someone
else's
case
on
that.
i
mean,
i
do
think
that
that
was
an
issue
that
was
resolved,
at
least
in
the
eleventh
circuit
in
alba.
it's
not
an
issue
that
applies
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
such
certificate
here
in
california.
i
do
think
it
would
be
adequate.
i
mean,
bush
v.
lucas,
which
was
a
federal
remedies
case,
said
there
were
what
they
called
"meaningful
remedies".
as
long
as
there
is
a
meaningful
remedy,
it's
sufficient.
and
if
congress
wants
to
think
that
there
is
a
problem,
for
example,
if
congress
thinks
there
is
a
problem
with
these
certificates
of
merit
in
the
case
of
privately
run
facilities,
then
it
certainly
can
establish
a
cause
of
action
as
it
did
in
section
1983.
but
the
bivens
doctrine
is
really
a
narrow,
as
we
say,
gap-filling
doctrine.
and
the
court
has
always
used
it
very
sparingly.
and
the
reason
the
court
has
done
that
is
because
there
is
no
authority
for
it
in
the
language
of
any
constitutional
or
statutory
provision.
so
the
court
has
always
treaded
very
cautiously
in
this
area.
and
i
wouldn't
rule
out
in
that
circumstance
that
somebody
could
make
that
argument.
i
--
i
just
don't
think
in
this
case
there
has
been
any
real
dispute
that
there's
an
adequate
remedy.
there
wasn't
in
malesko
and
that
was
sufficient
in
that
case.
and
we
think
it
is
sufficient
in
this
case
as
well
for
the
court
to
in
effect
stay
its
bivens
hand
and
turn
the
matter
if
necessary
over
to
congress.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
in
this
case,
the
agistrate
judge
did
it.
it
wasn't
an
impossible
burden
m
for
him.
this
was
done
on
a
prescreening;
the
court
ruled
exactly
as
we
are
asking
the
court
to
rule
now.
the
court
did
--
the
court
in
malesko
did
it.
it
wasn't
difficult.
if
it
is
deemed
that
there
is
an
issue
there,
there
are
various
procedural
mechanisms
that
could
be
employed.
there
could
be
a
dismissal
without
prejudice,
a
dismissal
with
repleading,
certificate
to
a
state
court.
you
could
stay
the
bivens
action.
there's
various
things
that
district
courts
can
do.
but
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
an
issue.
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
malesko.
we
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
an
issue
in
others
either.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
your
honor
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
wanted
to
correct
one
common
misimpression.
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
anyone
was
deliberately
starved.
with
the
allegation
regarding
the
food,
his
allegation
in
his
complaint
is
that
he,
because
presumably
his
arms
were
in
casts,
he
couldn't
hold
his
tray
in
the
cafeteria
and
therefore
he
says
i
had
to
buy
my
own
food
from
the
commissary
because
i
didn't
want
to
be
humiliated
by
going
to
the
cafeteria.
we
think
that
if
that
claim
somehow
stated
a
claim
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
deliberate
indifference,
that
he
would
state
a
claim
under
negligence
as
well,
and
all
of
these
claims
essentially
are
that
the
prison
failed
to
accommodate
his
injuries.
malesko
was
the
same.
in
malesko
the
argument
was
i
didn't
get
to
use
an
elevator
because
i
had
a
preexisting
condition,
and
that's
what
caused
my
harm.
if
there
is
something
that
negligently
causes
harm,
unreasonably
causes
harm,
there
is
a
remedy
in
california.
i
would
also
note
that
if
it
does
not
cause
harm,
there
is
no
bivens
remedy,
because
congress
in
the
plra
has
said
you
cannot
bring
any
claim
if
you
are
a
prisoner
in
federal
court
unless
it
involves
physical
harm.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
i
think
the
opinion
could
be
as
it
was
in
malesko,
there
is
no
bivens
action
because
there
are
alternative
remedies.
we
think
that
holding
in
malesko
would
apply
everywhere.
everybody
has
--
every
state
has
a
negligence
cause
of
action.
and
i
think
one
thing
that
crystallized
the
argument
for
me
is
the
colloquy
between
justice
scalia
and
--
and
my
friend,
where
i
think
there
was
an
admission
that
what
they
are
actually
seeking
is
a
blanket
cause
of
action
to
account
for
any
possible
instance
in
which
there
is
an
inadequate
remedy.
i
think
it
goes
even
further.
i
think
they
are
asking
for
a
blanket
cause
of
action
if
somebody
can
hypothesize
an
interest
--
and
issue,
and
even
further
than
that,
even
if
we
can't
hypothesize
it,
maybe
somewhere
along
the
line
something
could
happen.
we
think
that's
a
--
a
flipping,
a
turning
bivens
on
its
head.
bivens
is
a
narrow
remedy
that
is
only
allowed
if
those
circumstances
arise
they
when
it
is
necessary.
can
be
dealt
with
at
that
time.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
that
does
happen,
your
honor.
yes.
and
it
happens
i
think
relatively
frequently.
but
in
these
circumstances
we
would
expect
if
the
court
rules
our
way
that
there
would
be
in
fact
resort
to
what
are
not
only
adequate,
but
superior
state
law
remedies,
and
that
bivens
would
then
be
reserved
for
another
day
if
something
happened
that
might
implicate
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--there
may
be.
i
think
--
i
think
he
alleged
that
there
was.
we
would
agree
with
the
other
side
that
the
domicile
of
a
--
of
a
prisoner
at
least
in
the
circuits
is
determined
by
where
the
prisoner
had
been
before
they
were
in
prison,
and
i
think
this
particular
prisoner
had
been
somewhere
other
than
california.
so
probably.
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
about
the
--
the
mounting
--
controversy
but
probably.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
the
case
was
dismissed.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
the
case
was
dismissed,
your
honor,
and
it
was
appealed
only
on
the
ground
of
a
bivens
claim.
so
if
that
is
rejected,
there
is
no
more
case.
there
is
nothing
to
amend.
