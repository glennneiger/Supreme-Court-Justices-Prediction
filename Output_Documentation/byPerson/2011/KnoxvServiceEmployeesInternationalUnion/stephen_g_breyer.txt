justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
--
it's
peculiar,
because
in
the
circumstance
where
the
extra
assessment
is
all
going
to
go
to
chargeable
activities,
in
fact
that
means
economically
speaking
the
following
year
the
objector
will
be
better
off,
not
worse
off,
because
there
is
a
higher
percentage
of
the
total
fee
that's
being
paid
to
chargeable
activities.
so
this
special
assessment
that
justice
sotomayor
and
the
chief
justice
were
talking
about
is
one
that
will
benefit
the
objector,
if
he
keeps
quiet
and
says
nothing.
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
imagine
the
frame
of
mind
that
would
say,
i
need
the
notice
because
now
i
might
object
whereas
i
wouldn't
have
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that
point.
can
i
ask
you
--
oh,
are
you
--
you
want
to
pursue
that
further,
or
are
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
i
--
but
i
think
i
see
what
your
answer
is.
imagine
it's
year
2.
in
year
1
expenditures
broke
down
so
that
it
was
70
percent
chargeable,
30
percent
not
chargeable.
got
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
normally
under
hudson
that
means
in
year
2
the
deal
is,
the
objectors
pay
70
percent,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
middle
of
year
2,
surprisingly,
something
comes
up.
something
comes
up,
a
surprise
to
the
union,
and
they
want
to
have
a
special
assessment.
and
you're
saying
they
just
can't
without
going
through
this
procedure
all
over
again?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
this
is
a
peculiar
rule
that
you
have
asked
us
to
adopt.
the
rule
is
that
where
there
is
a
special
assessment
and
it
will
make
all
the
objectors
better
off,
they
have
to
have
a
special
notice
that
they
can
object.
but
where
the
rule
is
that
we
are
going
to
take
money
we
already
collected
from
them
and
spend
it
for
a
totally
political
purpose,
we
don't
give
them
a
special
notice
and
they
don't
have
to
object.
now,
that
seems
totally
backwards,
but
i
understand
why
you
get
there,
and
my
suspicion
is,
which
you
can
confirm,
is
that's
the
only
administrable
system
you
can
think
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
but
in
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
the
hypothetical,
if
i
could
continue
with
it,
is
--
is
perhaps
unrealistic,
but
they
have
20
bishops
and
the
14
most
honest
people
in
the
united
states,
and
they
have
all
absolutely
guaranteed
and
everybody
agrees
that
this
goes
to
chargeable
activity.
and
where
i
was
going
with
my
question,
which
you
see
where
i
was
--
you
are
with
me
on
this,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
combine
the
two.
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
and
get
your
response
is
that
you
have
been
forced
into
this
position
to
create
a
workable
system.
now,
why
is
that
workable
system
one
whit
better
than
the
workable
system
we
already
have,
which
is
all
this
washes
out
in
a
fair
manner
the
following
year,
that
there
is
an
inevitable
year's
lag,
it
doesn't
work
perfectly,
but
it's
as
good
as
any
other,
and
all
we
have
to
say
is
it's
better
than
yours?
now,
why
is
yours
better
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
useful
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
your
hudson
notice
tell
you
about
what
is
going
to
happen
next
year?
i
thought
your
hudson
notice
told
you
this
was
the
breakdown
for
last
year
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
that's
what
it
will
be
next
year,
but
things
should
change.
what
does
the
hudson
notice
tell
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
am
i
right
in
my
description
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
think
for
a
second
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor.
now,
i
would
like
you
to
see,
i
think,
why
she
asked
the
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
way
it
works
now
is
at
the
beginning
of,
say,
september.
september
of
year
2
we
look
back
to
year
1,
and
we
see
what
the
percentages
were.
and
now
we
in
the
union
calculate
a
budget
for
year
2.
and
we
go
and
get
approval
or
opt-outs
on
that
basis.
now
what
i
thought
coming
in
here
is
that
the
problem
was
going
to
be,
if
you
have
to
have
a
new
notice
in
the
middle
of
the
year
for
special
political
assessments,
you
are
going
to
discover
that
half
the
time
you
don't
know
if
they
are
special
political
assessments.
it's
an
impossible
line
to
draw.
it's
really
tough.
you
are
making
the
argument
that
however
you
draw
the
line,
we
are
on
the
right
side
of
it,
not
the
wrong
side.
isn't
that
what
basically
what
you
are
saying,
it's
not
a
special
assessment,
it
wasn't
really
accepted.
okay.
now,
but
there
is
a
new
argument
that's
come
along
that
i
hadn't
focused
on.
if
we
can
avoid
the
administrative
problem
by
saying
all
special
assessments
require
a
new
notice,
whether
they
are
for
political
purposes
or
not.
hence
the
question
that
i
was
trying
to
get
--
i
was
very
interested
in
your
answer.
if
we
had
that
rule
which
avoids
the
problem
of
saying
which
is
which,
how
does
that
affect
the
union?
not
necessarily
yours
but
unions
in
general.
how
often
is
it
that
you
draw
up
your
budget
for
year
2
in
september,
put
it
into
effect,
and
during
the
year
you
discover
you
need
more
money
from
people
for
any
reason,
and,
therefore,
you
change
what
you
thought
they
were
going
to
contribute.
how
often,
if
you
can
give
us
an
estimate,
and
you
are
in
a
better
position
than
i.
does
it
happen
a
lot,
rarely,
a
little?
what
do
you
want
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
the
--
the
problem
if
you
win
in
this
case,
and
then
there
is
this
other
way
of
getting
to
the
same
--
the
same
result
--
is
that
the
other
way
of
getting
to
the
same
--
same
result,
while
permissible,
is
far
less
transparent.
and
people
won't
understand
it,
and
it
--
it
encourages
a
kind
of
slyness
that
seems
highly
undesirable.
and
the
virtue
of
the
present
system
is
that
it
does
require
some
forced
loans,
that's
true,
but
it
does
wash
out
in
the
wash,
and
it
ends
up
being
fair
to
the
objectors.
and
it's
simply
hard
to
think
of
a
better
system
that
doesn't
provide
more
administrative
problems
than
the
existing
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
--
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
was
going
to
read
a
bit
of
the
dissent.
justice
kagan
and
i
do
dissent
and
for
the
most
part,
our
dissent
concerns
an
issue
that
normally
wouldn't
warrant
my
saying
anything
from
the
bench.
and
i
think
justice
alito
correctly
stated
the
issue
in
this
case
that
union
that
represents
nonmembers
in
collective
bargaining
can,
in
certain
states,
charge
those
members
a
fee
for
the
representation,
but
the
first
amendment
says
they
can't
charge
an
objecting
nonmember
for
certain
political
expenditures.
so,
given
that
constitutional
interpretation,
how,
in
the
context
of
a
special
midyear
assessment,
is
the
union
supposed
to
calculate
what's
the
proper
discount
to
give
the
objecting
nonmember
for
the
political
part
of
what
the
union
is
collecting.
now,
that's
an
administrative
question,
and
it's
not
easy
to
answer.
i
know
how
we
answer
it
normally
where
a
yearly
fee
is
involved.
well,
that
so,
an
accounting
firm
usually
goes
over
the
books
for
year
one,
and
they
figure
out
--
the
union
figures
out
on
the
basis
of
the
audited
accounts,
what
was
the
political
part,
what
was
the
nonpolitical
part,
and
it
then
collects
the
political,
nonpolitical
ratio,
whatever
that
was,
for
year
two
based
upon
year
one's
accounts.
what
happens
if
it
changes
during
year
two?
well,
then,
that
shows
up
in
year
three
because
they
used
year
two
for
years
three
and
it
all
works
out
more
or
less,
not
perfectly
but
more
or
less.
for
example,
if
30%
of
year
one's
for
union's
expenses
are
political,
the
union
in
year
two
can
charge
the
objecting
nonmembers
only
70%
of
the
basic
fees.
but
if
year
two's
political
expenses
turned
out
to
be
higher,
say
40%,
then
the
union
can
charge
the
objecting
nonmembers
in
year
three
only
60%
and
so,
it
sort
of
works
out.
and
justice
kagan
and
i
think
that
the
same
system
used
for
the
yearly
expenditures
should
be
applied
when
the
union
levies
a
special
charge
in
the
middle
of
the
year.
it's
workable.
the
majority
doesn't
think
this,
okay.
so
far,
what
we
have
looks
like
an
ordinary
disagreement
in
an
ordinary
case,
but
there
is
one
thing
about
the
majority's
opinion
that,
in
our
view,
is
not
ordinary
and
justice
sotomayor,
joined
by
justice
ginsburg,
agree
with
us
on
this
point.
the
majority
says
that
in
--
where
you
have
a
special
midyear
charge,
no
objecting
nonmember
has
to
pay
any
of
the
special
charge
unless
he
or
she
opts-in,
i.e.,
affirmatively
he
says
he
wants
to.
okay.
now,
we
are
very
concerned
about
that
part
of
the
opinion,
which,
in
technical
jargon,
goes,
“you
have
to
opt-in
or
opt-out.”
for
one
thing,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
such
a
case,
the
objecting
nonmember,
unless
they
affirmatively
agree,
wouldn't
even
have
to
pay
a
share
of
the
union's
purely
collective
bargaining
expenses,
say,
suddenly
arising
union
cost
to
hire
experts
to
help
it
bargain
about
pensions.
prior
cases
make
clear
that
the
nonmembers'
first
amendment
rights
cover
the
union's
political
expenses,
but
not
this
kind
of
ordinary
collective
bargaining
expense.
for
another
thing,
the
question
is
to
whether
objectives
are
--
was
it
the
opt-in,
they're
free
not
to
pay,
unless
they
say
they
want
to,
unless
they
opt-in
or
they
have
to
pay
unless
they
opt-out,
that's
the
opt-in
versus
opt-out,
that
that's
a
very
important
issue
in
the
minds
of
many
unions,
in
the
minds
of
many
employees
and
in
the
minds
of
many
employers
as
well
as
others.
how
should
the
law
treat
the
nonmember
employee
who
is
basically
indifferent?
it
isn't
carried
just
to
who
would
like
to
pay
it
less.
he's
indifferent
to
the
union's
political
expenditures.
for
50
years,
this
court
has
consistently
found
constitutional
a
system
that
requires
the
nonmember
to
opt-out.
you
have
to
care,
in
other
words
and
they've
said
that
was
constitutional
in
all
kinds
of
different
context
that,
to
us,
should
be
the
same
today,
but
today
the
court
takes
a
different
path.
further,
this
kind
of
question
has
been
entwined
with
words
you
will
recognize,
with
right
to
work
issues
and
related
issues
which
approved
highly
controversial
politically.
the
court
is
answering,
at
least
in
this
limited
special
assessment
context,
matters
about
which
many
unions,
employees
and
employers
have
strong
but
different
views,
and
it
is
a
matter
that
different
states
have
resolved
differently
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
by
holding
that
the
constitution
itself
answers
the
question,
the
court
has
wrongly,
in
our
opinion,
prevented
states
from
choosing
among
a
variety
of
different
possible
answers.
finally,
the
court
has
decided
this
matter,
we
think,
without
adequate
briefing.
the
opt-in
versus
the
opt-out
question
was
not
addressed
by
the
lower
courts.
it
was
not
presented
to
this
court
for
review
in
our
opinion.
the
parties
did
not
brief
the
question.
so,
in
our
view,
at
a
minimum,
the
court
should
not
have
decided
the
question
without
further
briefing.
justice
kagan
and
i
also
believe
that
in
any
event
because
of
the
some
of
the
administrative
concerns
that
the
majority
identify,
we
also,
the
two
of
us,
believe
the
court
came
up
with
a
wrong
answer.
