justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
merits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
attacking
the
normal
system
of
basing
assessments
moving
forward,
based
on
past
accounting
and
chargeability
and
non-chargeability?
or
are
you
just
attacking
the
special
assessment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
articulate
for
me
--
what's
--
borrowing
a
phrase
from
one
of
my
colleagues
yesterday,
how
do
we
write
this
opinion?
when
is
a
second
hudson
notice
required?
let's
presume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
union
had
cost
overruns.
labor
salaries
went
up;
printing
costs
went
up,
not
for
lobbying;
but
generally
there
was
a
10
percent
increase
in
their
expenses
across
the
board
because
various
contracts
that
they
were
involved
in
required
it.
would
you
require
a
second
notice
in
that
circumstance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
articulate
that
again?
a
material
change--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
they
take
the
money
that
they
collected?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
they
take
the
money
that
they
collected
under
the
first
notice
and,
instead
of
doing
a
special
assessment,
in
the
middle
of
it
this
campaign
gets
announced
by
the
governor,
and
can
they
then
divert
the
chargeable
amount
that
they
have
predicted
and
spend
it
on
the
non-chargeable
amount?
or
are
you
--
or
does
that
require
a
second
hudson
notice,
without
a
special
assessment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
is
in
this
system,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
practicality,
they
will
get
a
chance
to
object;
it
just
won't
be
at
the
moment
of
the
special
assessment;
it
will
be
the
following
year.
so
when
the
union
gives
its
new
notice,
it's
going
to
set
forth
its
chargeable
and
non-chargeable
amounts
as
audited,
and
it
will
say,
as
it
did
--
as
it's
done
in
the
briefs
before
us:
on
proposition
76
we
are
going
to
take
50
percent
as
chargeable.
and
the
union
members
can
come
in
and
give
a
lehnert
objection,
those
who
want
to.
those
who
don't
know
it's
happened
and
they
agree
to
it.
isn't
that
correct?
they
do
get
a
chance
to
object;
the
question
is
the
timing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
an
answer
to
that?
they
will
get
a
chance
to
object
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
true
of
the
first
example
i
gave
you.
if
something
happens
in
the
middle
of
the
year
and
the
union
needs
to
divert
already-assessed
funds
to
challenge
a
election,
they
can
do
it
and
you
said
that's
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
going
back
to
the
--
forget
about
special
assessments.
i
think
in
one
of
the
briefs,
i
know
in
one
of
the
briefs,
someone
says:
elections
happen
every
4
years,
so
in
the
normal
cycle
of
union
activities
in
an
election
year
they
are
going
to
divert
more
of
whatever
accessible
moneys
they
have
to
their
lobbying
efforts
and
the
following
year
they
will
go
back
to
normal
for
3
years.
you're
not
challenging
that
normal
variation
in
the
--
in
the
distribution
of
the
moneys,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
guess
my
problem
is
i
don't
see
how
that,
given
your
argument,
is
any
less
alone
than
this
special
assessment
where
the
labor
--
where
the
objecting
members
at
the
end
of
the
year
will
get
notice
of
what
has
happened
that
year,
will
have
an
opportunity
to
place
their
lehnert
challenges
and
get
them
ruled
upon,
and
will,
as
justice
breyer
said,
have
a
benefit
because
they
are
going
to
either
pay
more
if
the
lehnert
--
pay
less
if
the
lehnert
challenges
are
upheld
or
pay
more
if
--
if
they're
not.
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
this
is
a
different
loan.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
clarify
a
point?
i
thought
i
heard
and
maybe
i
just
didn't
look
at
the
union
regulations,
the
new
ones.
is
it
limited
to
180
days?
i
thought
i
heard
your
adversary
say
that
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
see.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
burden
is
on
the
union
to
give
a
second
hudson
notice
whenever
there
is
a
special
assessment?
meaning
do
you
happen
to
know
how
frequently
unions
impose
special
assessments
and
what
the
incremental
cost
is
to
the
union
of
giving
such
notice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
try
to
summarize
it.
i
wasn't
looking
to
monopolize
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
a
footnote.
and
it
happens
a
lot,
how
burdensome
is
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
please
answer
my
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
the
burden.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
don't
lose
it;
they're
going
to
do
it
the
following
september.
the
attractive
part
of
your
argument
from
the
beginning
was
that
this
is
somehow
a
forced
loan.
and
i
understand
the
attractiveness
of
that.
but
it
goes
back
to
what
justice
breyer
said
from
the
beginning,
which
is,
given
--
as
has
been
recognized,
that
money
is
fungible,
and
that
you
can't
really
often
predict
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future,
it's
been
developed
a
system
that
cyclically
gets
money
to
the
people
back.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
is
that
i
am
being
told
by
your
adversary,
and
since
we
don't
know,
i'm
always
afraid
of
writing
a
decision
in
a
vacuum,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
union
structure,
their
business
in
a
myriad
number
of
ways,
that
some
have
a
very
small
due
each
year,
and
a
larger
special
assessment
for
special
projects.
and
i
assume
there's
endless
variety.
you're
proposing
a
rule
that
every
single
time
an
assessment
outside
of
annual
dues
is
imposed,
that
a
new
hudson
notice
can
be
given.
and
you're
suggesting
justice
scalia,
that
all
they
have
to
say
is
we
think
it's
going
to
be
for
chargeable
effect.
