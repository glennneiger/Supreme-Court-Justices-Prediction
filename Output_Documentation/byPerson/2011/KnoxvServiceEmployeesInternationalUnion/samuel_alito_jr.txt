justice

if
the
special
assessment
requires
a
different
kind
of
notice,
and
possibly
a
different
kind
of
opt-in
or
opt-out
regime,
would
the
case
be
moot?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
kind
of
notice
--
with
the
typical
hudson
notice
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
when
the
annual
dues
are
collected.
we're
dealing
with
a
special
assessment.
now,
if
a
different
kind
of
notice
is
constitutionally
required
in
that
context,
would
this
case
be
moot?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
my
question
is
whether
the
--
the
different
requirements,
which
presumably
were
not
met
here
in
the
context
of
the
special
assessment,
if
there
are
different
requirements
in
that
context,
would
that
be
enough
to
preserve
this
case
as
a
live
controversy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
this
local,
and
what
will
the
other
locals
do
in
the
future
when
special
assessments
are
made?
will
they
provide
notice
or
will
they
go
back
to
the
old
system?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
incorrect
that
this
was
for
what
was
termed
a
"political
fight-back
fund"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example
and
maybe
you
will
say
that
this
is
different
from
your
case
and
the
rules
should
be
different
in
these
two
cases.
the
annual
dues
for
a
particular
--
for
members
of
this
union
are
1
percent
of
their
salaries
and
let's
say
that
amounts
to
--
or
it's
a
certain
percentage
of
their
salaries,
and
let's
say
that
amounts
to
$500
annual
dues.
and
let's
say
that
in
the
prior
year
90
percent
of
the
money
collected
by
the
union
was
used
for
chargeable
purposes,
10
percent
for
non-chargeable
purposes.
so
someone
who
objected,
a
nonmember
who
objected,
would
be
able
to
get
back
$50.
now,
during
the
course
of
the
year
the
union
levies
a
special
assessment
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
and
for
this
90
--
the
percentages
are
exactly
reversed.
90
percent
is
for
non-chargeable,
10
percent
is
for
chargeable.
so
now
a
member
who
potentially
wants
to
object
has
$450
at
stake.
now,
in
that
situation,
why
shouldn't
there
be
separate
notice?
aren't
the
economic
incentives
quite
different?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
as
i
said,
my
hypothetical
may
be
very
different
from
what
happened
here,
and
maybe
it's
an
unrealistic
hypothetical
and
you
can
answer
that.
but
if
it
were
to
occur,
should
there
not
be
hudson
notice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
the
money
is
going
to
be
used
for
an
election
campaign?
what
if
it
is
going
to
be
used
to
weigh
in,
in
favor
of
one
gubernatorial
candidate
against
another,
in
favor
of
one
slate
of
legislative
candidates
against
another.
and
on
those
issues,
the
nonmembers
may
have
very
strong
partisan
and
ideological
objections.
so
why
should
they
not
be
given
a
notice
at
that
time--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
given
the
opportunity
not
to
give
what
would
be
at
a
minimum
an
interest-free
loan
for
the
purposes
of
influencing
an
election
campaign?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
proponents
of
propositions
75
and
76
had
come
to
the
union
and
said,
would
you
please
give
us
an
interest-free
loan
for
money,
because
we
want
to
use
this
money
to
--
to
persuade
the
--
the
electorate
to
enact
these,
but
don't
worry,
because
we're
going
to
pay
it
back
right
after
the
election,
when
we've
achieved
our
electoral
ends.
would
--
would
the
union
provide
the
money
because
it's
all
going
to
come
out
in
the
wash?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
--
gee,
i
really
doubt
that
you
--
that
they
would.
but
what's
the
difference?
if
you
look
at
this
from
the
perspective
of
a
nonmember
who
doesn't
want
those
ballot
initiatives
to
be
defeated,
saying
that
we're
going
to
give
you
your
money
back.
we're
going
to
use
your
money
to
achieve
a
political
end
that
you
oppose,
but
don't
worry,
because
we're
going
to
give
it
back
to
you
next
year
after
we've
achieved
our
political
end.
how
does
that
solve
the
problem?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
a
case
about
compelled
speech
on
matters
at
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
the
question
is
whether
the
first
amendment
allows
a
public-sector
union
to
require
employees
who
are
not
members
of
the
union
to
pay
a
special
fee
to
support
the
union's
political
and
ideological
activities,
even
if
those
members
--
non-members
do
not
choose
to
do
so.
in
2005,
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
california
were
engaged
in
a
wide-ranging
political
debate
regarding
state
budget
deficits
and
in
particular,
the
budget
consequences
of
growing
compensation
for
public
employees
backed
by
public-sector
unions.
the
governor
called
for
a
special
election
in
november
of
that
year
to
consider,
among
other
things,
two
controversial
ballot
initiatives
that
would
have
limited
the
collection
of
mandatory
union
fees
and
given
the
governor
the
ability
to
reduce
state
appropriations.
these
measures
were
vigorously
opposed
by
public-sector
unions
including
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
service
employees
international
union.
a
few
months
before
the
special
election,
the
union
sent
out
a
notice
to
all
of
the
employees
and
its
bargaining
unit
concerning
a
special
fee
that
would
be
taken
automatically
from
the
employees'
paychecks
to
establish
a
political
fight-back
fund.
according
to
the
union's
announcement,
the
multimillion
dollar
fund
was
needed
to
achieve
the
union's
political
objectives,
both
in
the
special
election
and
in
opposing
the
governor's
reelection
the
following
year.
the
union
stated
that
the
money
would
be
used
as
follows:
“for
a
broad
range
of
political
expenses,
including
television
and
radio
advertising,
direct
mail,
voter
registrations,
voter
education
and
get
out
the
vote
activities
in
our
work
sites
and
in
communities
across
california.”
the
union
specifically
stated,
“the
fund
will
not
be
used
for
regular
costs
of
the
union,
such
as
office
rents,
staff
salaries
or
routine
equipment
replacement,
etcetera.”
it
noted
that
“all
other
public
worker
unions
are
in
the
process
of
raising
the
extraordinary
funds
needed
to
defeat
the
governor.”
a
subsequent
letter
from
the
union
said
that
the
money
from
the
political
fight-back
fund
would
help
“to
elect
a
governor
and
a
legislature
who
support
public
employees
and
the
services
they
provide”.
covered
employees
were
not
given
any
choice
about
whether
they
would
pay
into
the
fund.
a
group
of
nonunion
employees
who
were
forced
to
pay
the
fee
filed
the
present
lawsuit
alleging
a
violation
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
the
federal
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employees,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari,
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
first
amendment
not
only
protects
our
right
to
speak
out
on
political
issues,
it
also
protects
the
right
not
to
be
forced
to
say
things
with
which
we
disagree.
nevertheless,
our
prior
cases
have
allowed
state
and
local
governments
to
extract
fees
from
the
paychecks
of
nonunion
employees
and
give
that
money
to
a
union
in
order
to
pay
for
collective
bargaining.
we
have
recognized
that
this
is
a
serious
impingement,
that's
the
word
our
cases
have
used,
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
serious
impingement
on
employees'
free
speech
rights
because
it
requires
them
to
subsidize
the
form
of
union
speech
that
they
might
not
support,
but
we
have,
nevertheless,
tolerated
this
first
amendment
impingement
on
the
theory
that
collective
bargaining
tends
to
benefit
all
employees
who
are
covered
by
contracts
negotiated
by
the
union.
we
have
drawn
the
line,
however,
at
union's
political
and
idealogical
activities,
which
include
lobbying,
supporting
political
candidates
and
other
types
of
general
election
hearing.
these
activities
go
beyond
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining,
and
they
cannot
be
forced
--
they
cannot
be
financed
by
compulsory
fees.
in
a
case
called
teachers
versus
hudson,
decided
in
1986,
we
established
certain
procedures
that
a
union
must
follow
to
ensure
that
unwilling
employees
are
not
forced
to
pay
any
portion
of
their
regular
dues
for
these
political
and
ideological
expenses.
in
the
present
case,
we
consider
a
different
situation.
whereas
hudson
concerned
the
procedures
that
a
union
must
follow
when
collecting
regular
fees
on
an
annual
basis,
the
present
case
concerns
the
first
amendment
requirements
applicable
to
a
special
fee,
levied
to
meet
expenses
that
were
not
disclosed
when
the
regular
dues
notices
were
sent.
our
precedents
make
clear
that
compulsory
subsidies
for
private
speech
are
subject
to
exacting
first
amendment
scrutiny.
thus,
as
we
said
in
hudson,
unions
that
exact
fees
from
nonmembers
must
follow
procedures
that
are
"carefully
tailored
to
minimize
the
infringement
of
free
speech
rights”.
under
that
standard,
the
union's
conduct
in
this
case
is
indefensible.
there
is
no
justification
for
the
union's
failure
to
give
employees
a
choice
as
to
whether
they
wanted
to
support
the
political
fight-back
fund.
when
the
controversial
new
fund
was
announced,
some
employees
undoubtedly
objected
to
paying
into
it
even
though
they
had
failed
to
object
to
paying
nonchargeable
expenses
at
the
start
of
the
year.
the
union
and
the
dissent
argued
that
we
should
not
be
concerned
that
nonmembers
were
required
to
contribute
to
a
political
campaign
with
which
they
disagreed
because
they,
in
effect,
get
a
refund
of
this
money
when
they
paid
--
they
got
a
refund
of
this
money
when
they
paid
their
annual
dues
the
following
year.
this
argument
is
not
correct
as
a
factual
matter,
but
even
if
it
were
factually
correct,
nonmembers
cannot
be
compelled
to
make
an
involuntary
loan
to
support
an
election
campaign
even
if
this
loan
is
repaid
after
the
election.
what
this
argument
boils
down
to
is
the
following
we're
going
to
take
your
money
now.
we're
going
to
use
it
to
achieve
electoral
results
you
oppose
and
then
when
we've
succeeded
in
doing
that,
we
will
give
you
your
money
back.
a
loan
is
obviously
a
form
of
financial
support
and
therefore,
this
argument
is
flatly
contrary
to
the
principle
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
permit
the
government
to
compel
people
to
support
political
causes
with
which
they
disagree.
public-sector
unions
have
the
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
express
their
views
on
political
and
social
issues,
but
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
compel
contributions
from
unwilling
donors.
employees
who
choose
not
to
join
a
union
also
have
first
amendment
rights,
including
the
right
to
withhold
contributions
for
political
activities
they
do
not
support.
therefore,
when
a
public-sector
union
wants
to
impose
a
special
fee,
the
union
must
provide
a
fresh
notice
and
may
not
exact
any
funds
from
nonmembers
without
their
affirmative
consent.
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
should
not
decide
the
question
whether
in
the
context
presented
in
this
case,
affirmative
consent
is
required.
instead,
it
is
suggested
that
we
assume
that
it
is
sufficient
if
a
union
gives
nonmembers
an
opportunity
to
opt
out
of
making
the
payment.
with
this
approach,
it
would
require
either
this
court
or
the
lower
courts
to
decide
a
question
for
which
there
is
no
answer,
namely,
what
sort
of
procedures
would
make
an
opt-out
scheme
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
in
the
context
present
here?
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
no
procedures
can
make
an
opt-out
scheme
constitutional
in
this
context,
and
therefore,
the
opt-out
versus
opt-in
question
cannot
be
avoided.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justice
kagan
has
joined.
