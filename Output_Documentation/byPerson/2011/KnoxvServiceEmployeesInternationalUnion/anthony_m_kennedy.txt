justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
it's
capable
of
repetition,
yet
aiding
review?
i'm
not
quite
sure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
injunction
have
future
--
future
terms?
is
it
a
permanent
injunction
or
is
it
just
an
injunction
that
relates
to
the
notice
that
is
required
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
make
that
argument
in
your
opposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
answer
is,
it's
so
confusing
that
the
court
probably
should
consider
whether
or
not
an
opt-in
requirement
is
--
is
preferable.
i
--
we're
talking,
in
the
first
exchange,
you
had
with
justice
alito,
he
gave
you
a
very
simple
question:
90
percent,
10
percent.
then,
it's
reversed.
special
assessment
for
90
percent
political.
and
the
point
there
was
that
you're
taking
someone's
money
contrary
to
that
person's
conscience.
and
that's
what
the
first
amendment
stands
against.
and
you
simply
wouldn't
answer
that
question.
you
would
--
and
then
you
say
well,
maybe
it's
--
it's
fungible,
it's
hard
to
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
avoiding
a
very,
very
critical
question
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
objecting
members.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this,
just
in
the
way
of
background:
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations,
do
the
unions
consider
the
--
as
one
factor
the
importance
of
ensuring
that
the
government
or
employer
has
fiscal
stability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
ultimately
a
political
judgment,
so
that
even
collective
bargaining
involves
a
core
political
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
concede
then
in
ordinary
collective
bargaining,
there
are
critical
and
important
significant
political
judgments
that
are
being
made
by
the
union
in
the
course
of
collective
bargaining
with
chargeable
expenses?
