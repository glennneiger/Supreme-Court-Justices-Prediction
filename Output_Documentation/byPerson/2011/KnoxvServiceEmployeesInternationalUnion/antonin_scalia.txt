justice
antonin
scalia
a
material
new
assessment?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
we
are
talking
about
money
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
concede
that
it
is
going
to
make
them
better
off?
i
would
--
i
would
assume
that
that's
your
principal
objection.
they
don't
know
whether
this
new
assessment
is
indeed
going
to
be
divided
the
way
the
original
one
was
or
not.
they
might
want
to
challenge--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
--
whether
it's
all
going
to
be
used
for
--
for
assessable
activities
or
not.
and
they
have
no
--
you
are
telling
me
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
the
very
least,
they
have
to
make
a
--
an
interest-free
loan
to
the
--
to
the
union
until
such
time
as
they
can
challenge
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
we
wouldn't
need
a
hudson
notice
at
all,
if
--
if
bishops
affirmed
all
of
these
things,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
--
isn't
the
premise
of
hudson
that
you
give
the
notice
before,
before
you
--
you
receive
the
notice
before
you
have
to
cough
up
the
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
now
proposed
is,
well,
for
--
if
there
is
an
additional
assessment,
you
cough
up
the
money
first
and
then
later
you
straighten
it
out.
do
you
get
--
do
you
get
the
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
young,
i
hope
this
won't
use
up
much
of
your
time,
but
i
do
have
a
pressing
question
to
make
sure
that
we're
just
not
spinning
our
wheels
here.
what
if
the
union
here
had
--
had
simply
said
all
this
additional
assessment
will
go
to
bargaining
activities,
and
then
simply
used
its
original
assessment,
the
portion
that
had
been
anticipated
to
be
used
for
bargaining,
for
political
activities.
it
could
do
that,
couldn't
it?
it's
not
committed
to
--
to,
you
know,
an
80-20
or
whatever
the
division
is,
simply
because
that's
what's
given
out
in
the
first
notice.
it
can
indeed
use
its
--
the
anticipated
portion
for
bargaining
for
political
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
are
we
wasting
our
time?
i
mean,
all
the
unions
are
going
to
do
is
say
this
is
a
general
assessment
for
bargaining
purposes,
and
then
use
their
--
their
general
funds
for
the
political
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you
win
and
it
will
never
happen
again.
it'll
never
again
be
called
a
segregated
fund
for
politics.
[laughter]
