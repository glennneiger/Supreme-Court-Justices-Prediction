mr.
william
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
seiu's
motion
to
dismiss
for
mootness,
it
is
important
to
remember
the
underlying
facts
of
this
case.
for
10
months
in
2005
and
2006,
more
than
36,000
nonmembers,
or
nearly
40
percent
of
those
employees
represented
by
seiu
employed
by
the
state
of
california,
were
compelled
to
contribute
to
the
seiu's
$12
million
political
fight-back
fund
without
being
provided
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
amount
of
the
fee,
and
to
object
to
its
exaction
required
by
the
first
amendment.
adding
insult
to
that
injury,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
nonmembers
could
never
say
no
to
contributing
to
seiu's
political
expenditures
for
ballot
propositions,
at
least
proposition
76.
they
have
no
right
to
refuse
to
bankroll
that
element
of
seiu's
political
speech.
this
defies
this
court's
decisions,
distorting
the
political
process
on
a
massive
scale.
mr.
william
j.
young
i
was
just
addressing
that.
mr.
william
j.
young
i'm
not
sure
i
would
go
that
far,
justice
kagan.
i
think
in
this
case,
the
wishy-washiness,
as
it
were,
of
the
language
used
by
seiu
when
it
distributed
this
pasted-on
dollar
to
the
class
--
or
dollars,
more
accurately
--
was
inadequate
because
it
failed
to
represent
the
importance
of
the
judgment
that
the
nonmember
class
had
won.
mr.
william
j.
young
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
william
j.
young
not
in
this
case,
justice
kagan.
turning
to
the
adequacy
of
the
notice,
of
the
financial
disclosure,
that
did
not
comply
with
the
district
court's
judgment,
either.
if
--
if
the
only
question
were
the
distribution
of
nominal
damages,
then
perhaps
we
would
be
living
in
that
different
article
iii
universe.
but
this
case
is
about
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
the
seiu
was
attempting
to
comply
with.
they
failed
to
do
so
in
virtually
all
of
its
elements.
mr.
william
j.
young
the
--
the
district
court
had
ordered
--
described
the
type
of
notice
that
it
anticipated.
the
district
court
specifically
determined
that
seiu's
subsequent
2006
financial
disclosure
was
inadequate
to
cure
the
problem
that
was
caused
by
the
seizure
of
fees
starting
in
september
2005.
and
that
is
on
73a
of
the
petition
appendix
b.
the
union
in
this
case
merely
sent
the
same
financial
disclosure
in
the
notice
that
it
sent
--
to
try
to
moot
the
case,
that
it
had
sent
in
june
of
2006.
well,
the
district
court
had
already
said
this
is
inadequate.
that
seems
to
me
to
end
the
inquiry.
obviously,
the
district
court
did
not
contemplate
that
the
notice
that
was
sent
in
june
2006
satisfied
the
obligations
of
its
judgment;
else
it
hardly
could
have
ordered
a
useless
act
in
ordering
a
new
type
of
notice
go
out.
mr.
william
j.
young
the
reason
that
is
important,
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
excuse
me
--
is
that
the
seiu
is
asserting
that
the
case
has
become
moot
because
it
has
now
complied
with
the
district
court's
judgment.
mr.
william
j.
young
and
that's
certainly
one
of
the
possible
consequences.
obviously,
i
--
we
would
--
that
is
speculative
to
some
extent.
but
since
the
purpose
of
the
notice
is
to
provide
the
information
necessary
to
--
to
object,
one
of
the
purposes,
then
we
certainly
anticipate
that
there
would
be
more
objectors
were
there
to
be
an
--
an
adequate
notice
that
complies
with
the
district
court's
judgment.
mr.
william
j.
young
if
the
notice
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
william
j.
young
no,
it
would
not.
obviously,
we
have
--
we
have
--
still
have
the
nominal
damages
question,
and
the
adequacy
of
the
payment--
mr.
william
j.
young
--so
long
as
the
union
failed
to
provide
them,
and
at
least
in
this
case,
the
district
court's
judgment,
we
believe,
provides
an
adequate
respect
for
hudson's
underlying
requirement,
justice
alito.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
justice--
mr.
william
j.
young
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
and
this
is
why:
the
union
would
remain
free
to
return
to
its
old
ways
--
the
very
type
of
reason
that
this
court
declined
to
find
mootness
in
w.t.
grant.
the
union
has
made
much
--
much
of
a
showing
--
or
much
of
a
show,
more
accurately,
of
the
fact
that
it
has
changed
its
internal
policy.
it
won't
do
this
for
180
days.
but
that
can
hardly
be
sufficient
for
this
court
to
find
mootness
in
this
case.
the
union
made
this
wonderful
and
--
and
meaningful
policy
change
on
6
days'
notice.
mr.
william
j.
young
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
it
is
also
about
the
declaratory
relief
that
was
ordered
by
--
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
it
is
about
the
--
which
was
virtually
injunctive
relief
in
this
case.
it
is
also
about
the
effect
of
that
judgment
for
future
activities,
and
how
that
will
affect
the
way
seiu
operates.
mr.
william
j.
young
it
would
certainly
be
so
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
the
union
set
a
very
short
time
--
well,
a
relatively
short
time
period,
given
the
length
of
time
a
case
comes
up
from
the
courts
as
a
rule
in
this
court.
mr.
william
j.
young
just
--
just
to
be
clear,
there
is
--
i'm
talking
about
something
that's
tantamount
to
an
injunction,
justice
kennedy.
it
wasn't
actually
phrased
as
an
injunction.
it
was
an
affirmative,
ordering
an
affirmative
act.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
justice
kagan,
i
think
that
has
been
generally
the
case.
i
--
in
my
research,
i
could
find
very
few
cases
where
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
that
this
court
was
addressing
injunctive
relief.
hudson
itself
it
seems
to
me
did
not
specifically
discuss
the
entry
of
injunctive
relief
in
the
lower
court,
and
hudson
itself
addressed
a
mootness
issue.
if
we
--
if
we
talk
about
these
cases
in
their
--
in
their
strictest
sense,
the
union's
notices
are
all
annual,
so
by
the
theory
that
it
becomes
moot
when
those
notices
expire,
or
potentially
moot
when
those
notices
expire,
this
court
would
never
address
these
issues,
because
it
would
--
i
can't
imagine
one
of
these
cases
ever
getting
up
to
this
court
in
as
little
as
a
year.
but,
the
--
this
court
in
hudson,
in
i
believe
it
was
footnote
12,
said
that:
"this
court
reviews
the
policy,
the
procedure,
the
acts
as
they
were
defended
in
the
district
court.
"
and
the
union's
policy
and
procedure
and
acts
here
were
defended
in
the
district
court.
and
therefore,
cases
like
this
should
not
become
moot,
because
it
is
capable
of
repetition
and
would
be
evading
review
simply
by
the
mere
limits
of
how
long
these
policies
and
procedures
are
in
effect.
mr.
william
j.
young
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
implicit
in
our
argument,
although
clearly
our
main
point
in
that
argument
is
that
this
is
a
--
a
paradigm
case
of
voluntary
cessation
of
allegedly
unlawful
activity.
until
cert
was
granted
in
this
case,
until
the
petitioner's
merits
brief
was
filed,
seiu
was
vigorously
defending
its
practice.
it
remained
free
to
impose
that
practice.
mr.
william
j.
young
that's
--
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
pardon
me.
this
argument
--
this
argument
was
not
raised
until
we
were
before
this
court,
the
union's
argument
that
the
case
had
somehow
become
moot,
and
until
it
issued
a
notice--
mr.
william
j.
young
--well,
"all
the
relief",
justice
ginsburg,
implies
that
they
had
complied
with
the
district
court's
judgment.
as
to
the
notice,
we
--
we
believe
that
they
have
not,
and
--
and
we
believe
that's
clear
because
of
the
very
fact
that
the
district
court
rejected
the
2006
financial
disclosure
as
adequate.
and--
mr.
william
j.
young
--yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
certainly,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
william
j.
young
i
--
i
appreciate
the
question,
justice
sotomayor.
no,
we
are
not
attacking
the
normal
hudson
procedures.
on--
mr.
william
j.
young
--yes,
justice
sotomayor.
we
would
--
we
believe
--
pardon
me
--
that
a
new
hudson
notice
is
required
whenever
there
is
a
material
alteration
in
the
obligations
that
are
imposed
upon
nonmembers.
the
values
that--
mr.
william
j.
young
--a
material
increase
--
or
increase
in
general
terms,
in
the
obligation
imposed
upon
the
nonmembers.
in
this
case
i
don't
think
anybody
would
dispute
the
25
percent--
mr.
william
j.
young
--a
material
new
assessment,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
we
are.
certainly--
mr.
william
j.
young
--i
think
as
a
matter
of
principle
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
nonmember--
mr.
william
j.
young
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
so
much
a
special
procedure
as
a
new
opportunity
to
object
and
challenge
the
amount
of
the
fee,
mr.
chief
justice.
certainly
one
of
the
elements
--
and
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
the
primary
reason
individuals
object
is
political
expenditures
--
but
this
court
said
very
clearly
in
abood
that
people
can
object
for
any
reason,
for
no
reason,
for
a
good
reason,
for
a
bad
reason;
nobody
can
inquire
as
to,
why
someone
objects.
and
certainly
when
a
material
--
there
has
been
a
material
increase
in
the
obligation
imposed
upon
nonmembers,
they
may
choose
to
make
an
economic
decision
that
heretofore
they
chose
not
to
make.
they
may
choose
to
minimize,
particularly
the
non-objectors,
they
may
choose
that
they
want
to
minimize
the
financial
obligations
they
are
paying
to
the
union
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
young
justice
breyer,
the
reason
for
the
notice
is
these
people
may
not
trust
the
union.
they
--
they
may
choose
to
challenge
the
amount
of
the
fee.
mr.
william
j.
young
sure.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes.
mr.
william
j.
young
that
would
be
correct,
justice
breyer.
and
now
talking
about--
mr.
william
j.
young
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
j.
young
i
understand,
justice
sotomayor.
and
no,
under
that
case
i
don't
believe
it
would.
mr.
william
j.
young
that's--
mr.
william
j.
young
--well,
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes.
right.
mr.
william
j.
young
well,
i
recall
the
bishops
from
the
last
time
i
was
here,
justice
breyer.
i
think
they
made
an
appearance
then.
mr.
william
j.
young
they
are,
i'm
sure.
mr.
william
j.
young
you
anticipate
my
next
point,
justice
scalia.
these
--
these
aren't
bishops
and,
with
due
respect
to
our
litigation
opponents
in
this
case,
these
are
people
that
nonmembers
don't
trust.
these
are
people
with
whom
nonmembers
do
not
wish
to
affiliate.
and
these
are
people
that
the
nonmembers
do
not
wish
to
support,
and--
mr.
william
j.
young
--then
the
problem
is,
justice
sotomayor,
understanding
the
practice--
mr.
william
j.
young
--they
will
get
a
chance
to
object
after
they
have
already
paid
the
interest-free
loan.
mr.
william
j.
young
and
the
nonmembers
would
have
the
chance
to
challenge
that,
but
it
would
be
within
the
normal
system
of
ordinary
union
dues.
we,
and
i
believe
this
court
in
hudson,
presume
that
any
reasonably
competent
union
management
would
--
would
have
relatively
stable
expenditures
over
the
years.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes.
mr.
william
j.
young
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
problem,
justice
scalia.
the
people
who
got
the
june
2005
notice
were
left
in
the
dark
--
indeed,
the
union
may
have
been
in
the
dark
--
as
to
this
special
assessment.
but
once
the
union
agreed
to,
decided
to
impose
the
special
assessment,
the
union
was
required
by
hudson's
principles
to
shed
some
light.
perhaps
it
is
less
predictive,
less
accurate,
to
say:
we
intend
to
spend
the
money
this
way.
but
when
you
have
an
assessment
which
is
purely
intended
for
politics,
and
that's
what
the
union
said,
to
create
a
political
fight-back
fund,
that's
not--
mr.
william
j.
young
--the
hudson
notice
provides
you
with
an
opportunity
to
object
and
some
assurance,
because
of
the
audit
requirement--
mr.
william
j.
young
--i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
description,
justice
breyer.
mr.
william
j.
young
most
unions,
mr.
chief
justice,
require
an
annual
objection.
now,
of
course
there
would
be
nothing
--
we
find
nothing
wrong
with
an
annual
challenge
requirement
if
you
choose
to
challenge
that
year's
figures,
because
obviously
it's
a
specific
event.
but
most
unions
seem
to
require
annual
objection,
so
you
have
to
say
again
and
again:
i
don't
want
to
pay
for
your
politics.
but
that's
not
raised
in
the--
mr.
william
j.
young
--correct,
justice
sotomayor.
and
that,
too,
may
vary
from
union
to
union,
from
state
to
state
even.
as
some
of
the
justices
i'm
sure
know,
virginia--
mr.
william
j.
young
--well,
we
disagree
with
the
union's
characterization
of
its
supposed
benefit.
but,
justice
sotomayor,
i
see
my
time
has
expired
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
balance
for
rebuttal.
i
will
try
address
your
question
more
thoroughly
when
i
stand
up
again.
mr.
william
j.
young
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
young
it
would
be
free
to
do
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
young
because
the
nonmembers
still
have
that
right
to
challenge,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
young
and
money
is
fungible
to
a
degree,
justice
sotomayor
--
sotomayor
--
excuse
me.
and
i
respect
that
argument.
but
let's
remember
the
facts
as
we
have
them
here.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
a
segregated
fund.
there's
a
separate
portion,
a
separate
line
item
in
the
union's
notice--
mr.
william
j.
young
--i
lose,
justice
scalia,
and
it
will
happen
all
the
time,
i'm
afraid.
mr.
william
j.
young
but--
mr.
william
j.
young
--and
i
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
i'm
sorry
for
interrupting.
i
understand
that,
justice.
and
for
ordinary
union
dues,
that's
why
when
justice
sotomayor
asked
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
whether
we're
challenging
the
ordinary
hudson
system,
i
answered
no,
because
that
system
is
perfectly
adequate
for
ordinary
union
dues.
mr.
william
j.
young
sure.
mr.
william
j.
young
well,
the
issue
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
j.
young
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
so
justice
sotomayor,
the
answer
is
that
i'm
saying
it
would
be
brief
--
and
my
friend
mr.
collins
is
saying
that
it
doesn't
happen
that
often,
so
the
burden
is
minimal.
unions
have
other
options
than
extracting
this
money
from
unwitting
nonmembers,
through
interest-free
loans.
and
i
thank
the
court.
