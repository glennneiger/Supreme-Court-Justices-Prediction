mr.

mr.
young--
justice
ruth

--as
i
understand,
the
union
recognizes
that
a
consequence
of
mootness
would
be
that
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
is
vacated.
now,
if
the
union
would
also
recognized
that
that
means
the
district
court
judgment
stays
in
place,
so
if
the
ninth
circuit
judgment
is
worked
out
and
you're
left
with
the
district
court
judgment
as
the
law
of
the
case,
then
i
think
it
is
moot,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
--
this
case
is
about
a
completed
episode.
it's
about
the
special
assessment
that
is
wrong
or
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's
another
--
something
quite
different
than
the
capable
of
returning
to
old
ways,
because
here
we
do
have
a
discrete
episode
that's
over.
and
there
was
no
question
that,
even
though
--
what
was
this,
in
2005
--
that
the
period
in
2005-2006,
when
the
special
assessment
was
in
effect,
that
was
long
over,
but
you
were
continuing
to
litigate
it.
and
nobody
suggested
that
it
would
become
moot
simply
because
the
period
was
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
said
that
it
had
become
moot
because
they
gave
you
all
the
relief
you
requested,
so
there
was
nothing
left
to
the
case.
