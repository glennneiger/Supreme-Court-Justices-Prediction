mr.
jeremiah
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg
is
absolutely
correct
that
what
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
be
vacated,
with
the
consequence
of
reinstating
the
district
court
judgment.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
when
the
events
in
this
matter
were
new
and
the
then
union
officers'
actions
were
being
challenged,
the
instinct
was:
we
are
going
to
defend
the
case.
and
as
time
went
on
there
was
no
rethinking
of
that
situation.
when
the
case
was
granted
here
over
our
opposition,
noting
that
we
didn't
think
the
questions
presented
were
really
presented,
the
officers
of
the
union,
who
were
not
the
ones
involved
in
the
original
case,
thought
about
the
situation
and
came
to
the
realization
that
they
have
no
stake
in
the
procedures
that
are
at
issue
here.
this
is
a
local
that
had
never
done
a
mid-year
increase
in
the
past.
what
was
contemplated
as
a
temporary
increase
here
turned
into
a
permanent
increase.
the
dues
went
up
to
1.5
percent
of
salary
a
year
after
this
increase
ended.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
this
local
--
and
i
won't
belabor
the
term
"special
assessment"
at
the
moment,
but
when
we
get
to
the
merits
i
think
there
is
a
misunderstanding
around
that,
justice
alito.
but
this
local
has
put
in
a
procedure
which
frankly
would
satisfy
the
petitioner
s'
concerns
for
the
future
if
future
conduct
was
legitimately
at
issue
here.
but
it
is
not,
for
two
reasons.
first,
when
we
state
that
the
district
court
judgment
would
be
reinstated,
that's
a
judgment
that
was
not
appealed
by
the
petitioners.
that
defines
the
limits
of
what
they
can
attain
from
this
case,
whatever
this
court
may
decide,
and
that
decision
gives
whatever
protection
it
gives
against
future
conduct.
now,
it
gives
essentially
none
for
a
very
good
reason.
this
was
a
case
that
has
been
noted,
brought
only
about
a
one-time
event.
there
were
no
allegations
of
an
ongoing
practice,
there
was
no
request
for
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
no,
it
doesn't,
justice
kagan.
the
court's
explained
in
a
number
of
cases,
beginning
i
think
with
walling
v.
ruder,
and
also
obviously
munsingwear,
and
u.s.
bank
corp.,
a
case
can
be
in
a
posture
where
this
court
in
disposing
of
it
needs
to
grant
certain
relief,
clarification
of
the
status
of
prior
orders,
and
yet
the
case
is
moot
on
the
merits
such
that
the
court
cannot
appropriately
reach
the
merits.
that's
what
we
have
here.
if
there
is
a
dispute
--
and
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
why
there
really
isn't.
but
if
there
is
a
dispute,
for
example,
as
to
whether
an
individual
failed
to
get
their
refund
because
the
notice
was
inadequate,
that
dispute
is
not
affected
by
and
requires
no
decision
of
this
court.
if
the
district
court
judgment
is
reinstated
then
the
question
of
whether
we
have
fully
provided
all
relief
called
for
by
that
judgment,
which
we
believe
we
have,
would
be
before
the
district
court's
decision.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
i
think
that's
incorrect,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
district
court
required
a
certain
kind
of
notice
to
be
given.
we
are
stating
the
district
court
judgment
should
be
reinstated.
if
the
notice
we
have
given
does
not
comport
with
what
the
district
court
judgment
which
was
not
appealed
by
the
petitioners
requires,
it
will
be
provided
by
the
district
court.
we
are
--
we
are
not
contesting
--
the
petitioners
are
looking
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
a
case
can
be
moot
in
this
court
and
this
is
what
i
believe
munsingwear,
walling
v.
reuter
and
the
other
cases,
u.s.
bancorp
more
recently,
explained.
at
first
it
seems
paradoxical,
but
it
is
not
paradoxical.
a
case
--
there
can
be
remaining
issues
potentially
in
the
district
court,
such
as
whether
the
check
that
the
plaintiff
paid
bounced
or
not,
that
could
potentially
have
to
be
resolved
by
a
district
court.
and
it
--
but
it
means,
at
least
in
terms
of
prudential
mootness,
there
is
not
a
substantive
merits
issue
remaining
for
the
court
to
be
deciding.
and
it's
really
quite
simple.
the
petitioners,
as
i
say.
are
looking
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth.
the
apex,
the
acme
that
they
can
achieve
in
this
case,
is
what
they
got
from
the
district
court
and
it
was
reversed.
we
are
saying:
give
it
back
to
them.
take
back
the
reversal,
reinstate
the
judgment.
whatever
they
won
they
will
have.
we
believe
we
have
already
given
them
everything
they
want.
if
we
have
not,
the
district
court
will
do
that.
but
let
me
explain
the
second
point,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
that
there
is
no
legitimate
issue
here
about
whether
the
notice
was
adequate.
mr.
young
stated
quite
incorrectly
that
the
notice
we
have
provided
is
the
same
as
the
notice
the
district
court
struck
down.
that's
absolutely
incorrect.
the
district
court
said
that
the
2005
notice
issued
before
the
dues
increased
obviously
did
not
give
specific
notice
of
the
dues
increase,
although
it
stated
that
dues
could
be
increased.
the
district
court
specifically
held
at
petitioner
appendix
73a
that
the
2006
notice
which
described
the
so-called
fund
and
the
dues
increase
and
the
purposes
of
it
was
completely
adequate.
and
the
notice
the
district
court
--
one
also
has
to
realize,
the
district
court
was
requiring
the
union
to
refund
only
the
non-chargeable
portion
of
activities
attributed
to
this
increase.
a
certain
kind
of
notice
would
be
needed
for
that
to
justify
how
the
union
was
computing
what
it
was
saying
with
the
chargeable
portion
to
refund.
but
what
the
union
has
done
here
is
provide
greater
relief
than
the
district
court
ordered.
we
have
refunded
every
penny
that
anyone
who
requests
had
paid
during
the
increase.
so
there
is
no
serious
question
that
the
notice
that
the
union
sent
out,
which
explained
what
the
increase
had
been
spent
on,
sufficiently
informed
individuals
as
to
whether
they
now
want
to
get
back
every
penny,
as
we
have
offered
them,
of
what
they
paid
under
the
increase.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
all
right.
turning
to
the
merits--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--no,
it
has
a
provision
that
it
can't
be
repealed
without
a
180-day
notice.
there
can't,
can't
be
a
sudden
repeal
of
the
new
procedure.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
but
i
do
want
to
make
clear,
we
think
nothing
--
our
position
on
mootness
is
not
dependent
on
the
court
determining
that
the
new
procedure
will
be
in
effect
forever.
our
position--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--that
requires
a
fairly
extensive
answer,
i
believe,
justice
sotomayor,
partly
because--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--i
believe
--
i
believe
the
word
"special
assessment"
is
being
used
here
with
a
meaning
that
doesn't
correspond
to
what
this
union
did.
i
can
say
this
much:
there
has
never
--
there's
been
only
one
other
case
in
any
federal
court
that
i
am
aware
of,
and
only
in
a
district
court,
there's
been
no
other
appellate
court,
dealing
with
any
kind
of
assessment,
temporary
dues
increase
and
how
it
affects
hudson
rights.
so
this
is
a
non-event
in
the
real
world.
there
are
no
challenges
that
have
been
made
previously
to
any
kinds
of
assessments
or
increases.
but
unions
use
assessments
in
two
--
in
many
different
ways.
and
let
me
contrast
one
way
with
what
happened
here,
and
i
think
it
will
show
why
there
is
no
serious
question
here
about
a
need
for
a
notice.
some
unions
have
a
dues
structure
which
covers
only
certain
kinds
of
activities.
and
they
contemplate
a
new
kind
of
activity
that
they
would
not
normally
pay
for
out
of
dues
or
fees.
they
say
often
with
a
vote,
which
was
not
required
here.
there
was
no
vote
required
or
taken
here
of
bargaining
unit
members
for
what
occurred
in
this
instance.
but
you
may
have
a
union
that
says:
we
want
to
make
the
kind
of
expenditure
that's
really
unanticipated.
it's
not
what
we
normally
do
with
our
dues.
we
are
going
to
put
it
to
a
vote.
if
you
approve
it,
we
will
collect
it,
we'll
probably
put
it
in
a
segregated
fund
separate
from
our
treasury.
that
kind
of
an
assessment
can
raise
potential
issues,
i
would
acknowledge,
under
hudson.
it's
worlds
away
from
what
we
have
here
because
all
that
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
union
increased
from
1
percent
to
1.25
percent
of
salary,
the
regular
membership
dues,
and
the
fees
based
on
those
dues
that
were
deducted
by
employers
and
paid
into
the
union's
general
treasury--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--it
was
--
some
union
communications
described
it
as
having
that
sole
--
that
purpose.
the
october
27th
letter,
which
was
the
most
detailed
explanation,
said
it
had
two
purposes,
basically
to
fight
back
at
the
bargaining
table
and
to
fight
back
politically.
but
what's
essential,
justice
alito,
it
was
never
suggested
nor
was
it
ever
the
case
that
this
money
would
be
in
any
way
segregated
or
treated
as
a
separate
entity
so
to
speak.
so
we
have
the
schermerhorn
problem
here.
basically,
petitioners'
position
is
based
on
the
fallacy
exposed
in
schermerhorn
of
trying
to
take
part
of
a
unified
general
treasury
and
treat
it
as
if
it
were
a
distinct
entity,
because--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
there
could
be
a
problem
there
if
the
assumption
is
then
that
the
union
really
is
beginning
a
kind
of
spending
that's
really
foreign
to
the
way
it's
spent
money
in
the
past.
what
needs
to
be
explained
here,
though,
justice
alito,
is
i
don't
think
one
would
guess
from
anything
that
has
been
said
today
that
we
are
talking
about
a
period
of
time
when
the
union's
chargeable
spending
increased
and
its
non-chargeable
spending
decreased.
we
are
talking
about
a
period
of
time
when
objecting
nonmembers
did
not
even
pay
their
pro
rata
share
of
the
concededly
chargeable
expenditures,
meaning
they
did
not
pay
one
penny
for
any
political
activities.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
well,
the
problem
--
it
would
be
a
closer
question,
but
i
think
not,
because
again
it
would
be
caught
up
in
the
subsequent
year.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
it
would
depend--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--it
would
depend,
justice
alito.
i
think
in
your
hypothetical,
one
might
be
able
to
say
--
there
might
be
more
facts
needed,
but
one
might
be
able
to
say
that
what
is
occurring
is
something
that
could
not
be
anticipated
reasonably
by
the
person
who
got
the
notice.
in
this
case,
however
--
and
this
is
crucial
to
this
case
--
the
notice
in
2005
told
every
nonmember
that,
of
our
$38
million
budget,
we
spent
43.6
percent
of
it
last
year
on
non-chargeable
activities.
and
if
you
do
not
object,
we
will
spend
whatever
amount
out
of
our
roughly
$40
million
budget
in
the
coming
year
on
various
activities
as
we
perceive
the
need,
including
specifically
ballot
initiatives,
which
were
specifically
mentioned
in
the
notice
as
one
of
the
things
the
union
spent
its
money
on.
now--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--well,
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
special
assessment
if
one
uses
that
term
as
it
is
usually
used,
to
mean
a
very
short-term
assessment
apart
from
general
union
functions
for
a
new
kind
of
function.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
but
it's
nothing
new
under
the
sun,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
can
see
that,
for
example,
the
record
reflects
the
audit
for
2005
shows
us
that
in
addition
to
the
money
that
was
attributed
to
the
dues
increase
and
spent
in
opposing
these
ballot
propositions,
additional
money,
approximately
$2
million,
was
spent
on
those
same
purposes
from
the
pre-increase
dues.
so
ballot
--
opposing
ballot
initiatives
is
nothing
new
for
this
scenario
--
17--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--i
--
i--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--i
will
get
to
that,
justice
sotomayor.
i
have
tried
to
determine
how
frequent
it
is,
and
i
have
been
unable.
all
i've
been
able
to
determine
is,
there
is
no
litigation
over
it.
how
often
--
and
i
have
been
able
to
determine
that
so-called
assessments
take
many
different
forms
from
--
and
i
think
there
are
crucial
distinctions
from
funding
what
would
--
a
kind
of
charge
that
would
not
otherwise
be
funded
out
of
dues
for
some
short
period
of
time
to
the
opposite
extreme.
what
we
have
here
and
what
i
don't
think
would
be
called
an
assessment
frankly
by
anything
i've
read,
a
temporary
dues
increase
which
became
permanent
and
which
simply
increased
the
total
flow
of
dues
and
fees
into
the
general
treasury
and
which
went
for
the
usual,
the
kinds
of
activities
the
union
had
always
funded.
and
in
that
regard,
there
is
one--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--the
burden.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
the
burden
consists
of
two
things,
justice
sotomayor.
the
--
if
a
union
has
to
give
a
new
hudson
notice
in
a
situation
like
this
whereas
i
have
been
trying
to
explain
the
spending
that
went
on
is
really
not
different
from
what
one
would
have
reasonably
anticipated
given
the
notice,
then
we
have
litigation
and
disputes
about
the
need
for
new
notices
whenever
any
number
of
things
happen.
because
one
thing
that
happened
here
that
is
undisputed
but
hasn't
been
discussed
is
that
collective
bargaining
costs
were
up
six-fold
in
2005
over
2004,
and
they
were
up
six-fold
in
2006
over
2005.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
the
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
isn't
that
straight
forward
is
quite
simply
that
all
of
these
questions
about
it's
a
special
assessment,
we
can
figure
out
what
it
is,
we
can
treat
it
separately,
flounder
when
one
realizes
that
so-called
special
assessment
is
simply
a
dues
increase.
because
if
i
were
to
try
to
imagine
--
let's
try
to
imagine
the
notice
that
could
have
been
given.
if
i
were
giving
a
new
notice
in
the
fall
of
2005
to
explain
to
all
nonmembers
how
things
look
now
compared
to
what
they
--
how
they
may
have
looked
when
the
hudson
notice
was
given,
i
would
say
the
following,
completely
consistent
with
all
the
facts
of
record
in
this
case
as
revealed
in
the
audit.
i
would
say:
we've
determined
we
need
more
income.
part
of
this
is
because
we
anticipate
$3.7
million
in
fight-back
expenses
this
year.
another
part
is
we
expect
more
than
$3-1/2
dollars
of
additional
bargaining
costs
this
year,
and
we
expect
a
lot
of
other
changes
on
our
costs.
on
the
petitioner's
theory,
and
this
is
why
schermerhorn
is
the
complete
answer
to
their
theory,
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
if
the
union
says:
we
are
going
to
view
this
increase
as
paying
for
our
additional
political
costs,
and
it's
going
to
free
up
our
bargaining
--
our
general
treasury
for
the
bargaining.
that's
a
violation.
but
if
you
say:
we
are
going
to
treat
this
increase
as
covering
those
new
bargaining
costs
we
told
you
about,
that's
going
to
free
up
our
general
treasury
for
the
political
costs.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
but
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
there
were
other
statements
that
said
the
money
would
be
used
for
both
purposes.
but
as
schermerhorn
points
out,
schermerhorn
says
even
if
you
specifically
say
this
part
of
our
dues
income
is
going
to
be
earmarked
for
this
purpose,
it's
artificial
when
you're
dealing
with
a
general
union
treasury,
not
a
separate
segregated
fund,
to
give
that
separate
legal
status.
and
that
--
because
that
is
why
--
my
point
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
changed
here.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
i
--
i
really
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
that's
not
the
situation
here,
justice
alito.
the
nonmembers
were
told
in
june
2005
in
the
hudson
notice
that
if
you
don't
object,
we
may
spend
millions
of
dollars
on
political
activities,
including
ballot
initiatives.
if
a
person
didn't
want
to
support
that,
they
merely
needed
to
object.
but
what
then
happened
--
and
this
is
what
gets
lost
in
the
messaging
about
the
dues
increase
--
what
actually
happened
in
the
real
world
in
the
period
that
followed
is
that
compared
to
the
numbers
in
the
2004
hudson
notice,
the
union
spent
less
on
nonchargeable
matters
and
more
on
chargeable
matters,
and
the
only
reason
there's
a
case
here
in
the
court
is
that
the
union,
for
whatever
pr
purposes,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
instead
of
saying,
we're
going
to
treat
the
increase
as
covering
our
vastly
increased
bargaining
costs,
thereby
freeing
up
money
for
politics,
we're
instead
going
to
describe
this
increase
as
being
attributable
to
our
political
costs,
thereby
freeing
up
money
for
bargaining.
but
what
the
union
is
spending
its
money
on
is
bargaining.
more
money--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--i
won't
avoid
the
--
i
don't
believe
--
i
was
not
meaning
to
avoid
it,
justice
kennedy.
what
i
thought
i
said
is,
if
you
are
springing
something
on
someone
that's
not
anticipated
in
the
notice
that
gave
them
their
rights
to
object,
then
there's
a
problem.
my
point
is
very
simple.
anyone
reading
the
2005
notice
--
hudson
notice,
if
that
person
was
asked
--
if
i
--
if
i
don't
object,
might
the
union
spend
$3.7
million
next
year
on
ballot
initiatives
that
i
may
not
want
to
oppose?
the
answer
would
be
yes.
the
notice
made
it
perfectly
clear--
mr.
jeremiah
collins
--that's
generally
considered,
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
abood.
and
the
reason
that
exclusivity
and
agency
fees
are
permitted
in
--
in
serving
an
important
government
purpose
is
that
the
government
has
concluded
that
its
interest
lies
in
having
an
exclusive
spokesperson
who
--
with
whom
it
can
negotiate
so
that
it
won't
have
an
array
of
different
employment
relations
or
concerns.
mr.
jeremiah
collins
absolutely.
and
abood
explicitly
says
that.
and
abood
then
says
that
nevertheless,
the
government
--
we're
talking
about
a
regulatory
scheme
to
promote
the
government's
interest
in
orderly
labor
relations
--
the
government
needs
to
make
arrangements
and
agreements
on
terms
of
employment;
it
has
a
vital
interest
in
having
an
exclusive
representational
arrangement
where
that
can
be
accomplished.
and
that,
the
court
held
in
abood
--
and
it's
not
challenged
by
petitioners
--
that
justifies
the
degree
of
impingement
that
is
inherent
in
the
fact
that,
as
your
honor
correctly
says,
all
bargaining,
particularly
in
the
public
sector,
has
political
elements
in
it.
