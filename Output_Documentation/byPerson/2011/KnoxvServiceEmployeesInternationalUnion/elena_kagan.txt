mr.
young,
could
i
ask
you
to
speak
to
the
mootness
question
first?
justice
elena
kagan
as
--
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you're
--
you're
essentially
saying
that
it's
impossible
to
moot
a
claim
for
nominal
damages.
is
--
is
that
a
correct
reading
of
your
position?
justice
elena
kagan
so
that's
a
different
point,
right,
which
is
that
the
notice
was
inadequate--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
when
you
say
"inadequate",
i
read
you
to
be
saying
sort
of
not
apologetic
enough.
and
--
in
other
words,
not
saying,
look,
you
had
a
claim
against
us,
we
think
you're
right;
it
was
a
valid
claim;
here
is
your
judgment
in
satisfaction
of
that
claim;
that
it
didn't
forthrightly
say
that.
but
do
you
think
if
it
had
forthrightly
said
that,
we
would
be
living
in
a
different
article
iii
universe?
justice
elena
kagan
and
how
is
that?
how
did
they
fail
to
comply,
other
than
the
question
of
whether
they
were
forthright
enough
about
the
fact
that
they
were
satisfying
the
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
but
isn't
that
important,
mr.
young,
because
usually
where
we've
talked
about
capable
repetition,
or
where
we've
talked
about
the
same
thing
could
happen
again,
it's
where
an
injunction
has
been
before
us
rather
than
a
suit
for
damages
as
to
a
past
act.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
collins,
as
i
understand
mr.
young's
argument,
there
is
a
serious
dispute
about
the
adequacy
of
this
notice,
and
it
might
be
a
dispute
about
whether
it
was
clear
enough,
about
that
it
was
satisfying
claims,
or
it
might
be
a
dispute
about
whether
it
allowed
refunds
easily
enough,
but
that
mr.
young
is
contesting
whether
the
notice
complied
with
the
district
court's
order.
now,
as
long
as
that's
true,
don't
we
have
a
live
case
before
us?
somebody
has
to
answer
that
question
about
whether
your
notice
complied
with
the
order,
and
if
it's
the
case
that
a
court
has
to
answer
that
question,
doesn't
that
depend
on
the
questions
presented
here,
the
substantive
questions?
justice
elena
kagan
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
10-1121,
knox
versus
service
employees
independent
union.
