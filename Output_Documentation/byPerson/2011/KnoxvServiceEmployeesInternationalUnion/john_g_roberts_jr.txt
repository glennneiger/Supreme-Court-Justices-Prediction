chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1121,
knox
v.
the
service
employees
international
union.
mr.
young.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
reason
that's
important
in
terms
of
the
content
of
the
notice,
the
inadequacy,
is
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
--
a
different
type
of
notice
would
have
resulted
in
more
members
electing
to
opt
out,
to
demand
the
refund
of
their
assessments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
it's
a
good
point
for
you
to
move
to
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
without
regard
to
the
reason
for
the
assessment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
--
this
may
just
simply
be
repeating
justice
sotomayor's
question,
but
if
they
say
we
have
to
raise
the
assessment
10
percent
because,
as
she
said,
you
know,
we
estimated
the
printing
costs
for
the
union
newsletter,
whatever,
was
going
to
be
this
and
it
turns
out
they
raised
it,
it's
going
to
be
that,
so
we
know
we
are
going
to
have
to
get
additional
money
for
things
that
are
indisputably
chargeable,
why
do
you
need
special
procedures
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
carry
over
from
1
year
to
the
next,
or
do
you
have
to
refile
your
objection
to
the
union
expenditures
every
year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
you
give
up
once
the
case
was
granted
here?
you
didn't
consider
that
until
the
case
came
before
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
an
incidental
matter.
the
whole
point
of
your
friend's
argument
with
the
hudson
notice
is
they
want
people
to
understand
what's
happening
with
their
union
money.
and
they
say
this
notice
didn't
let
people
know
that.
and
if
the
case
is
not
moot
and
if
they
prevail,
they
will
have
a
right
to
be
heard
on
what
the
notice
should
say.
and
that
will
make
a
difference
in
how
many
people
opt
out
or
how
many
people
don't.
and
i
guess
i'm
following
up
on
justice
kagan's
question.
that's
a
very
important
part
of
this
case,
what
the
notice
is
going
to
say,
and
if
we
accept
your
view
that
it's
moot,
that
issue
goes
by
the
wayside.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
see
how
that
--
i
don't
see
how
that
works.
the
notice
is
only
required
by
the
district
court
if
the
case
is
not
moot.
if
the
case
is
moot
by
the
notice
you
sent
out,
the
district
court
doesn't
have
a
case
on
the
basis
of
which
to
order
a
different
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
want
you
to
move
to
the
merits.
it
may
be
a
good
time
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
point,
though,
was
this
was
a
very
special
ballot
initiative.
that's
what
the
literature
suggests,
that
this
was
not
sort
of
the
normal
run
in
the
courts
every
two
years,
every
election
cycle
we
spend
something.
that's
why
it's
a
special
assessment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
short-term;
it's
just
until
november
7th
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
reason
--
i
mean
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
union
is
compelling
nonunion
members
to
give
them
money
for
political
activities.
we
allow,
as
i
understand
hudson
as
i
read
it,
because
you
can't
figure
out
what
that
is,
you
wait
until
the
end
of
the
year.
in
other
words,
it's
a
compromise
for
administrative
convenience.
normally
you
wouldn't
allow
it
at
all,
as
i
--
at
least
under
the
law
as
i
read
it,
you
would
not
allow
people
to
take
money
--
you
would
not
allow
the
union
to
take
money
from
people
who
don't
want
to
spend
it
on
political
activities
so
the
union
could
spend
it
on
political
activities.
but
we
allow
it
during
the
course
of
the
year
because
it's
impossible
as
you
go
on
to
sort
these
things
out.
i
thought
the
argument
on
the
other
side
was
when
you
have
a
special
assessment,
an
additional
charge,
there
you
don't
have
the
administrative
problem.
you
can
tell,
it's.25
%.
so
you
can't
take
that
until
you
tell
them,
do
you
want
to
object
or
are
you
happy
--
are
you
fine
with
having
this
spent
on
political
purposes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but,
i
mean
--
i'm
reading
from
the
district
court
opinion.
it
said
that
this
assessment
would
be
used,
and
they
are
quoting
from
union
material,
"for
a
broad
range
of
political
expenses,
including
television,
radio
advertising,
direct
mail,
voter
registration,
voter
education,
and
get-out-the-vote
activity
in
our
work
sites
and
in
communities
across
california.
"
and
it
further
said,
"the
fund
will
not
be
used
for
regular
costs
of
the
union
such
as
office
rent,
staff
salaries,
or
routine
equipment
replacement.
