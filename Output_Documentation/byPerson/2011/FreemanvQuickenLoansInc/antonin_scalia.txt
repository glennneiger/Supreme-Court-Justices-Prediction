reaching
all?
i
didn't
understand
you.
you
said
it
too
fast.
as
reaching
all
--
something
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
unearned
fees,
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
suppose
if
--
if
the
lower
court
could
have
been
wrong
for
either
one
of
two
reasons,
we
don't
have
to
decide
which
of
the
two
we
--
we're
precluded
from
considering,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
it's
--
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
say
that
the
question
presented
here
decides
the
case
as
it
would
be
to
say
that
the
question
raised
by
justice
breyer
decides
the
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
put
the
one
before
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
mean
that,
but
it
need
not
mean
that.
it
could
mean
either
that
or
just
--
just
part
and
not
whole;
and
which
of
the
two
it
means
is
often
decided
by
the
other
words
with
which
it's
associated.
i
mean,
if
--
if
you
have
a
phrase
that
says,
you
know,
"tacks,
nails
and"
--
what?
"tacks,
nails
and
wooden
pegs.
"
it's
clear
that
"nails"
doesn't
mean
toenails;
it
--
it
means
a
fastener.
and
so
also
here,
when
--
when
it
says
"portion,
split
or
percentage",
it
seems
to
me
that
the
natural
reading
is
that
portion
or
percentage
means
not,
as
it
could
mean,
the
whole,
but
rather
just
a
portion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
we
have.
we
have
--
we
have
a
statute
that
says
you
shall
not
take
any
portion
or
split.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
and
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--give
me
an
example
of
where
the
language
"give"
would
have
an
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
deprived
it
of
all
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
nothing
as
big
as
this,
if
you
accept
hud's
interpretation
of
this,
which
is
essentially
the
issuance
of
a
price
schedule
by
hud
and
anything
above
these
prices
is
an
overcharge
and
hence
falls
under
--
under
this
provision.
that's
immense.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
if
we
don't
then
we
reject
deference
to
hud,
which
you
want
us
to
--
to
apply.
we
can't
at
one
time,
at
one
and
the
same
time,
give
deference
to
hud
and
yet
disagree
with
what
hud
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i
assume
that
hud's
interpretation
of
a
criminal
statute
like
ours
must
give
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
so
that
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
--
i
mean,
that's
our
standard
rule.
if
there's
a
genuine
ambiguity,
you
find
for
the
interpretation
that
favors
the
defendant.
and
this
here,
i
think
this
is
at
the
very
least
ambiguous.
and
you
are
telling
me
--
well,
i
guess
you're
right.
i
guess
hud
is
favoring
what
would
be
the
defendant
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
if
--
you
know,
if
i
charge
you
an
exorbitant
amount
for
cutting
down
a
tree,
you
know,
2,000,
$20,000,
then
i
present
my
bill,
you
would
say
that
i
have
not
earned
it,
simply
because
it's
exorbitant?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you
have
to
evaluate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
respondent's
interpretation,
i
don't
think
have
you
to
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
was
earned
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
anybody,
any
knowledgeable
person
who
applies
for
a
loan,
who
doesn't
ask
whether
there
are
any
points?
i
mean,
it's
standard
mortgage
practice.
and
if
somebody
says,
i'm
going
to
give
8
percent,
yes,
8
percent
with
or
without
points?
i
mean,
that
--
i
don't
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
interest
rate
was
8
percent
means
that
you
can't
charge
points
and
that
any
charging
of
points
is
a
charge
for
a
service
not
performed.
the
service
performed
is
giving
you
an
8
percent
rate.
now,
if
she
didn't
want
the
points,
she
should
have
when
it
came
to
the
closing
say,
what
are
these
points
for?
the
8
percent
is
what
you
agreed
to.
and
they
would
have
said,
well,
that
8
percent
is
the
--
is
the
rate
we
give
when
we
charge
2
points.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
--
the
so-called
kickback
in
(a)
is
not
for
services
not
actually
performed.
the
referral
--
the
referral
is
certainly
a
service
performed
to
the
lender.
there's
--
there's
--
there's
nothing
--
what
should
i
say
--
unethical
about
getting
a
fee
for
a
referral.
it's
--
it's
called
a
finder's
fee.
so,
you
know,
under
(a)
a
finder's
fee
is
--
is
made
unlawful,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
under
(b),
something
quite
different,
and
that
is
giving
money
to
somebody
who
performs
no
service
at
all
is
made
unlawful.
and
for
that
you
don't
need
an
agreement,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
100
percent
thing
--
is
this
a
real
problem
that
congress
was
addressing?
do
you
know
of
any
100
percent
kickbacks
or
100
percent
payments
to
somebody
else
for
services
not
performed
as
opposed
to
just
keeping
part
and
giving
the
rest?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
enough
reason
for
its
not
being
addressed,
that
it's
not
a
real
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
made
the
decision
that
a
finder's
fee
in
this
area,
although
in
all
other
areas
is
perfectly
okay,
but
a
finder's
fee
in
this
area
is
a
kickback.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
an
agency
is
construing
a
criminal
statute,
a
statute
providing
for
criminal
penalties,
do
you
think
the
agency
is
constrained
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
and
to
assume
that
if
there
is
ambiguity
it
should
be
interpreted
in
favor
of
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
concede
that
if
we
give
it
chevron
deference,
you
lose?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
on
both
--
the
case.
if
we
give
either
the
policy
statement
or
the
rule,
chevron
deference,
you
lose.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
you
want
to
talk
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
give
deference
to
interpretations
that
are
beyond
the
limits
of
what
the
language
will
bear,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
complete
your
earlier
answer?
i
was
just
waiting
for
your
point,
and
it
never
came.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
any
agency
have
interpretive
authority
regarding
the
statute
its
implementing?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
agency
that
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
to
be
specifically
conferred?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
at
all
increased
when
it's
specifically
conferred?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
give
deference
to
legal
interpretations
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
idea.
what,
am
i
supposed
to
psychoanalyze
congress
in
every
chevron
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
under
--
under
(b)
there
doesn't
have
to
be
an
agreement
to
pay.
under
(b)
there
doesn't
have
to
be
an
agreement
to
pay
the
title
company
to
nor
work.
it's
just
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
a
refinancing
and
the
title
company
did
the
same
title
search,
you
know,
two
years
ago,
it
says
heck,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
again,
but
it
still
gets
the
10
percent,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
there
is
no
agreement
to
pay
it
for
no
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
be
liable
under
state
law,
i
assume,
for
fraud,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
a
provision
of
the
real
estates
settlement
procedure's
act,
respa,
which
is
codified
at
12
u.
s.
c.
section
2607(b),
states,
"no
person
shall
give
and
no
person
shall
accept
any
portion,
split,
or
percentage
of
any
charge
made
or
received
for
the
rendering
of
a
real
estate
settlement
service
other
than
for
services
actually
performed".
petitioners
are
three
married
couples
who
obtained
mortgage
loans
from
the
respondent
here,
quicken
loans,
inc.
they
filed
separate
actions
in
louisiana
state
court
alleging
that
quicken
had
violated
section
2607(b)
by
charging
them
fees
for
which
no
services
were
provided
in
return.
after
the
cases
are
removed
to
federal
court
and
consolidated,
quicken
sought
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
petitioners'
claims
were
not
cognizable
under
2607(b)
because
the
allegedly
unearned
fees
were
not
split
with
any
other
party.
the
district
court
agreed
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
quicken,
a
divided
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari.
the
question
in
the
case
boils
down
to
whether
2607(b)
prohibits
the
collection
of
an
unearned
charged
by
a
single
settlement
service
provider
or
rather,
covers
only
transactions
in
which
a
provider
shares
a
part
of
the
settlement
service
charge
with
one
or
more
other
persons
who
did
nothing
to
earn
their
share.
in
urging
the
former
interpretation,
petitioners
rely
on
a
2001
policy
statement
issued
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
which
they
claim
is
entitled
to
deference
under
the
framework
announced
by
this
court
in
the
case
called
chevron.
we
need
not
resolve
the
party's
dispute
about
the
applicability
of
chevron
because
we
conclude
that
the
position
urged
by
petitioners
"goes
beyond
the
meaning
that
the
statute
can
bear",
a
phrase
in
one
of
our
earlier
cases.
in
our
view
2607(b)
is
unambiguous.
it
covers
only
a
settlement
service
providers
splitting
of
the
fee
with
one
or
more
other
persons.
by
providing
that
no
person
shall
give
or
shall
accept
a
portion,
split,
or
percentage
of
a
charge
that
has
been
made
or
received,
other
than
for
services
actually
performed,
2607(b)
clearly
describes
two
distinct
exchanges.
first,
a
charge
is
made
to
or
received
from
a
consumer
by
a
settlement
--
by
a
settlement-service
provider.
that
provider
then
gives
and
another
person
accepts
a
"portion
split
or
percentage
of
the
charge".
congress'
use
of
different
sets
of
verbs
with
the
distinct
tenses
to
distinguish
between
the
consumer-provider
transaction,
the
charge
that
is
made
or
received,
and
the
fee-sharing
transaction,
the
portion,
split,
or
percentage
that
is
given
or
accepted,
would
be
pointless
if,
as
petitioners
contend,
the
two
transactions
could
be
collapsed
into
one.
petitioners
contend
that
a
provider
can
make
a
charge
by
demanding
payment
and
then
accept
the
portion
of
the
charge
consisting
of
100
percent,
but
this
does
not
avoid
collapsing
the
sequential
relationship
of
the
two
stages
and
it
would
destroy
the
tandem
character
of
activities
that
the
text
envisions
at
stage
two,
that
is,
both
of
giving
and
accepting.
and
if
the
consumer
with
a
person
who
gives
a
portion,
split,
or
percentage
of
the
charge
to
the
provider,
who
accepts
it,
consumers
would
become
law
breakers
because
it
forbids
both
the
giving
and
the
accepting.
this
statute
subjects
violators
not
only
to
monetary
liability,
but
also
the
potential
criminal
prosecution.
we
find
it
entirely
unthinkable
that
congress
would
have
created
that
strange
disposition,
holding
the
consumers
themselves
liable
through
the
language
as
obscure
as
that
relied
upon
here.
the
phrase,
portion,
split,
or
percentage
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
2607(b)
does
not
cover
the
situation
in
which
a
settlement-service
provider
retains
the
entirety
of
the
fee
received
from
the
consumer.
although
portion,
the
words
"portion"
and
"percentage"
can
be
used
to
include
the
entirety
of
something
and
we
talk
about
100
percent,
300
percent,
dictionaries
show
that
as
used
in
the
present
context,
they
ordinarily
mean
a
part
of
the
whole
to
speak
of
the
lion's
share
of
the
kill,
which
means
100
percent,
or
all
of
it
is
wryly
humorous
because
of
the
share
does
not
usually
mean
100
percent.
and
it
would
be
just
as
wryly
humorous
if
the
english
translation
of
aesop's
fable
had
been
rendered
the
lion's
portion
instead
of
the
lion's
share.
that
meaning
is
confirmed
here
by
the
common
sense
canon
of
noscitur
a
sociis
which
counsels
that
a
word
is
given
more
precise
content
by
the
neighboring
words
with
which
it
is
associated.
and
here,
portion
and
percentage,
the
words
that
could
possibly
mean
the
entirety
appear
as
part
of
a
phrase
in
which
they
are
joined
together
by
the
intervening
words
"split"
which
as
petitioners
acknowledge
cannot
possibly
mean
the
entirety.
petitioners
invoke
the
canon
against
surplusage
urging
that
if
2607(b)
is
not
construed
to
prohibit
all
unearned
fees
it
would
be
rendered
superfluous
in
light
of
a
neighboring
provision,
2607(a)
which
expressly
prohibits
kickback
arrangements.
but
the
prohibition
in
2607(a)
is
at
one
in
the
same
times
broader
and
narrower.
it
is
broader
because
it
applies
to
the
transfer
of
anything
of
value
rather
than
to
the
dividing
of
a
charge
which
is
all
that
(b)
covers
and
it's
narrower
because
it
requires
an
agreement
or
understanding
to
refer
business
between
the
parties
to
the
kickback.
because
each
section
reaches
conduct
that
the
other
does
not,
there
is
no
need
to
adopt
petitioners'
improbable
reading
of
2607(b)
in
order
to
prevent
super
--
superfluity.
we
also
reject
petitioners'
appeal
to
statutory
purpose
because
vague
notions
of
statutory
purpose
cannot
over
come
2607(b)'s
unambiguous
text
and
we
reject
the
related
contention
that
our
reading
of
2607(b)
will
lead
to
absurd
results
because
petitioners
do
not
contend
that
quicken
--
that
quicken
split
the
challenge
charges
with
anyone
else.s
ummary
judgment
was
properly
granted
in
favor
of
quicken.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
