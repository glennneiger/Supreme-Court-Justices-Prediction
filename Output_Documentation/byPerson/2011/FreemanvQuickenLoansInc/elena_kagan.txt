it
looks
to
me
as
though
you
have
an
additional
statutory
problem.
you
have
two
sets
of
verbs
in
this
statute.
one
is
the
"give
and
accept"
set
of
verbs
and
then
the
other
is
the
"charge
made
or
received".
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
statute
is
thinking
about
is
at
first
that
there's
a
charge
made
or
received,
and
that
charge
is,
of
course,
the
charge
that
the
consumer
pays
to
the
provider.
and
then
there's
another
transaction.
and
that
transaction
is
the
"give
or
accept"
transaction,
and
that
transaction
occurs
between
two
service
providers.
so
one
set
of
verbs
refers
to
the
consumer-provider
relationship,
the
other
set
of
verbs
refers
to
the
provider-provider
relationship.

mr.
hefferon,
if
you
are
right
about
subsection
(b)
and
its
meaning,
what
does
it
do
that
subsection
(a)
does
not
do?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
why
would
congress
have
done
something
that
says,
a,
pursuant
to
an
agreement,
b,
not
pursuant
to
an
agreement?
why
wouldn't
it
just
have
one
provision
that
didn't
make
any
reference
to
an
agreement?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
hefferon,
i
don't
think
that
is
true
that
--
we
defer
to
agencies,
not
because
we
think
that
agencies
do
statutory
interpretation
in
exactly
the
way
courts
do.
we
actually
defer
to
agencies
because
we
think
they
provide
something
different,
not
because
they
are
the
best
parser
of
statutory
language,
but
because
when
they
see
ambiguity
they
are
able
to
import
policy
judgments
into
that
ambiguity.
and
that
seems
to
me
exactly
what
the
agency
did
here.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hefferon,
you
might
be
right
that
we
never
get
to
chevron
deference
here
because
the
statute
is
plain
on
its
face,
and
there's
no
ambiguity
for
the
--
the
agency
to
think
or
do
anything
about.
but
let's
just
assume
that
there
is
ambiguity
on
the
statute,
and
the
question
is
whether
to
provide
this
interpretation
with
chevron
deference.
so
then,
what's
your
argument
for
why
there
should
be
no
chevron
deference
to
this
interpretation,
given
that
the
statute
under
which
this
interpretation
was
promulgated
refers
identically
to
regulations
and
interpretations
as
something
that
hud
gets
to
do?
justice
elena
kagan
that's
just
a
way
of
saying
that
there's
no
ambiguity
here.
but
i
was
suggesting
that
if
there
is
ambiguity
here,
i
--
at
least
i
have
not
found
a
reason
not
to
give
hud
deference
in
this
situation.
i
mean,
you
say
they
didn't
do
a
very
good
job.
but
we
don't
usually
grade
agencies
like
that,
and
say,
well,
you
didn't
do
a
very
good
job,
so
you're
not
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
