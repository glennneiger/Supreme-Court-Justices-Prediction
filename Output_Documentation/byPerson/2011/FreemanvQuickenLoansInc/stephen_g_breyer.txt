justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
did
this
--
this
may
be
a
side
issue,
but
i
don't
see
how
this
is
a
fee
for
service.
i
mean,
i
thought
points
is
simply
a
way
of
paying
more
money
up
front
and
getting
a
lower
interest
rate
later.
it
isn't
supposed
to
be
for
any
service;
it's
simply
a
question
of
the
loan
term,
how
much
you
borrow
and
what
the
interest
rate
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
decide
theoretically
in
the
context
of
a
case
that
does
not
involve
paying
a
fee
for
a
service
that
doesn't
exist,
whether
you
can
pay
for
a
service
that
doesn't
exist?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how?
what's
--
what's
the
argument
on
the
other
side?
a
point
is
a
way
of
paying
more
money,
i.e.,
borrowing
less.
since
you
pay
more,
that
means
you
borrow
less.
so
your
interest
rate
is
lower,
because
you
borrowed
less.
now,
what's
the
argument
on
the
other
side?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
how
does
that
work?
the
bank
says
to
mr.
smith:
we
are
going
to
charge
you
$100
for
a
courier
service,
and
then
they
don't.
so
there
it
is
on
the
bill.
and
mr.
smith,
really
knowing
he
didn't
get
the
courier
service,
pays
the
$100.
all
right.
why
isn't
mr.
smith
guilty,
on
your
interpretation?
i
mean,
on
your
interpretation
every
innocent
consumer
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
that.
it's
my
fault.
but
--
but
wouldn't
--
it
says
that
if
she
doesn't
get
the
appraisal,
but
she
has
to
pay
for
it,
then
why
isn't
she
--
why
hasn't
--
why
doesn't
she
fall
within
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
got
was
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
hasn't
the
consumer
violated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
is
the
bank
liable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
see.
so
you
are
saying
when
the
bank
writes
down,
"pay
$100
for
the
courier
service.
"
the
bank
is
charging
for
the
courier
service.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
the
consumer
pays
for
the
courier
service
which
he
sees
there,
the
consumer
is
not
paying
for
the
courier
service.
he
is
paying
for
the
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
why
doesn't
he
fall
within
the
--
within
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
consumer
doesn't
violate
it
in
those
circumstances
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
tell
me
where
in
the
briefs?
i
have
to
read
this
about
six
times
to
get
this
one
in
my
head.
where
in
the
briefs
does
it
explain
to
me
why
in
your
situation
the
bank
would
be
violating
it,
but
the
consumer
wouldn't,
since
it
says
"no
person
shall
give"
as
well
as
"no
person
shall
receive"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
my
goodness.
if
it
isn't
in
the
briefs,
maybe
i'm
off
on
a
track
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
pretty
obvious
question.
i
mean,
we
have
a
statute
that
looks
like
a
kickback
statute
and
the
reason
it
looks
like
a
kickback
statute
is
because
it
refers
both
to
the
person
giving
and
to
the
persons
receiving,
and
it
seems
to
make
them
equally
liable.
you
want
to
apply
it
to
a
situation
where
i
don't
think
you
want
to
hold
consumers
liable,
and
so
i
think
you
have
to
explain
to
me
why
this
statute
doesn't
on
your
reading
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
you
mean
it's
all
prosecutorial
discretion?
in
other
words,
if
you
happen
to
be
a
consumer
you
just
have
to
rely
on
the
goodwill
of
the
prosecutor;
is
that
the
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
you
--
i
don't
want
to
take
all
your
any
more
time
on
this
because
to
me
the
more
important
problem
was
the
problem
of
the
difference
between
a
kickback
statute,
which
we
could
understand
as
well
as
within
hud's
expertise
and
normal
and
of
course
very
good
reason
for
doing
it.
but
a
price
control
statute,
where
we
have
the
federal
agency
deciding
whether
the
prices
are
accurate
for
each
service
that
is
rendered
or
whether
some
percentage
or
all
of
it
represents
service
for
nothing,
that's
a
rather
big
novelty
in
american
life.
that
is,
we
have
it,
but
there
are
usually
federal
agencies
that
have
a
system
set
up
for
determining
proper
prices
and
so
forth.
so
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
sort
of
inadvertently
congress
brought
in
the
second
under
the
guise
of
the
first
without
a
big
fuss
being
raised
and
big
debate
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
the
problem.
the
problem
is,
look,
you
are
saying
this
is
a
payment
for
a
service
that
wasn't
given.
i
think
i
might
say
that
this
is
just
a
lower
interest
--
a
higher
interest
rate
than
they
--
than
they
expected.
somebody
might
say,
you
didn't
get
the
courier
service
at
all.
others
might
say,
you
got
service
but
not
the
gold-plated
service,
and
the
gold
plate
was
nothing.
you
see,
that's
what
happens
when
you
get
into
a
price
control
statute
rather
than
a
kickback
statute.
and
that
is
our
concern
here,
i
think
at
least
mine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
1992
they
promulgated
the
regulation,
which
is
the
strongest
argument
i
think
on
the
other
side.
it's
a
strong
argument.
have
you
--
has
anybody
looked
at
that
notice-and-comment
proceeding?
have
you
looked
at
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
you
have,
do
they
go
into
this
point,
a
point
about
the
point
being
this
is
a
kickback
statute?
it
isn't
an
overcharge
price
regulation
statute.
therefore,
promulgating
a
regulation
that
makes
it
a
crime,
a
federal
crime
to
overcharge,
which
is
what
the
regulation
says,
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute.
now
did
someone
make
that
argument?
if
so,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
read
it,
and
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
see
what
the
agency
said
in
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
would
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
this
a
fair
statement
in
your
view,
and
we
will
hear
this
on
rebuttal,
that
in
respect
to
the
1992
regulation
there
is
a
sentence
which
says,
"a
charge
by
a
person
for
which
nominal
services
are
performed
is
an
unearned
fee
and
violates
this
section?
"
all
right,
i've
ellipsed
part.
all
right,
it
says
that.
and
that
later
on
is
taken
as
being:
this
statute
is
a,
to
that
extent,
a
price
regulation
statute.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
notice
of
such
a
regulation
was
not
given?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
comment
received
in
respect
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
that's
a
good
question,
and
your
problem
is
different
people
feel
differently
about
the
answer,
which
is
why
from
my
perspective
--
and
perhaps
you're
only
answering
a
question
for
me
and
no
one
else
has
it
--
but
i
would
be
pretty
interested
to
know
whether
when
you
looked
at
the
legislative
history
of
this,
what
you
discovered
was
a
lot
of
complaints
about
consumers
paying
for
things
they
didn't
get,
period.
which
favors
hud's
interpretation.
or
whether
you
see
a
whole
long
list
of
complaints
about
consumers
having
to
pay
referral
fees,
where
that's
just
one
person
taking
advantage
of
another
person's
business.
i
would
--
i
think
it
would
be
relevant.
and
then
if
you've
looked
at
all
this,
which
you
can
tell
me
you
have,
and
i
will
try
to
--
but
what
do
you
find?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
once
you
say
that,
you're
--
you
are
outside
the
reg.
i
mean,
when
you
read
the
reg
and
the
policy
statement,
it's
pretty
clear
what
they
are
thinking
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
policy
statement
is
even
clearer;
what
they
are
thinking
of
is
overcharges,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
here.
it's
on
--
it's
on
5305.7
and
what
they
are
explaining
is
that
--
and
they
are
talking
about
a
third
situation
and
they
say
one
settlement
service
provider
charges
a
fee
to
a
consumer
where
no
work
is
done,
or
the
fee
exceeds
the
reasonable
value
of
the
services
performed
by
that
provider.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
if
it
exceeds
the
reasonable
value
of
the
services
performed
by
that
provider,
you
have
to
say,
what
is
the
reasonable
value
of
the
services
performed
by
that
provider?
and
that
involves
the
agency
in
the
job
of
deciding
what's
a
fair
or
just
price
for
this
particular
service.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i'm
doing
there,
you
see,
is
now
i'm
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
an
agency
interpretation
which
is
other
than
what
it
says,
where
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
to
change
the
nature
of
the
statute
from
a
kickback
statute
into
a
statute
that
protects
consumers
across
the
board
from
paying
for
things
they
don't
get.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
that's
where
i'm
sort
of
interested
in
what
the
legislative
history
said,
etcetera,
etcetera.
it's
much
more
complicated
than
i
thought
coming
in.
i
have
to
look
at
a
lot
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
part
of
that
is
--
you
might
want
to
say
something
about
the
other
part.
i
mean
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
apa/chevron
stuff
is
to
prevent
agencies
saying
the
supreme
importance
of
their
own
mission,
taking
a
statute,
running
with
it
and
in
particular
transforming
into
a
criminal
law
something
that
really
wasn't
much
there.
now
procedure
is
important
in
that.
and
that's
why
i'm
very
interested
in
whether
--
whether
--
whether
they
gave
notice
to
the
public:
"dear
public,
we
are
thinking
that
this
is
far
more
than
a
kickback
statute.
"
"we
would
like
to
hear
what
you
think
about
that.
"
