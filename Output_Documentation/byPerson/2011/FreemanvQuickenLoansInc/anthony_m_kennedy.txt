justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
said
in
some
of
our
cases,
oh,
don't
worry,
this
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor,
close
enough
for
government
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
hud
have
expertise
in
determining
criminal
statutes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure.
it
seems
to
me
that
even
under
the
respondent's
view
of
the
statute
you
have
to
inquire
into
reasonableness
to
see
if
the
fee
was
earned.
