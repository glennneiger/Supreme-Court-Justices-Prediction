chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-1042,
freeman
v.
quicken
loans.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
argument
that
100
percent
is
certainly
true
as
a
matter
of
logic.
but
in
the
phrase
100
percent.
in
other
words,
you
are
apportioning
or--
you
are
splitting
the
fee
with
somebody
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
have
--
"portion"
i
suppose
could
still
mean
a
full
portion,
"split"
probably
not.
but
i
mean,
the
more
natural
reading
is
surely
a
division.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
--
the
--
the
reason
--
one
objection
to
your
idea
that,
well,
this
covers
partial
so
it
must
cover
100
percent,
is
that
it's
a
very
different
issue
if
you
are
talking
about
partial
and
100
percent.
if
you
are
talking
about
partial,
you
have
a
classic
case
of
a
--
a
kickback.
but
if
you
suddenly
say
100
percent
of
an
unearned
fee,
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question
to
decide.
in
this
case,
for
example,
you
get
a
whole
bunch
of
things
from
quicken
loans,
including
the
loan
and
all
this
other
stuff,
and
it's
kind
of
hard
to
single
out,
well,
this
part
is
unearned
but
this
part
is
earned;
it's
kind
of
a
whole
package.
when
you
have
a
portion
or
split
it's
an
entirely
different
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
there
--
there's
a
more
--
it's
a
narrower
issue
when
you
are
talking
about
a
portion.
say
the
kickback
goes
to
the
appraiser.
maybe
you
can
decide
in
that
case
whether
the
loan
company
really
had
anything
to
do
with
the
appraisal
at
all.
when
the
alleged
unearned
fee
goes
to
the
whole
loan
company,
it's
a
little
harder
to
say
which
part
was
unearned
and
which
parts
might
have
been
earned.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
just
the
way
these
loans
work,
right?
i
mean,
it's
the
same
thing
whether
you
pay
10
percent
and
no
points
or
9
percent
and
3
points.
you
know,
which
one
of
those
is
earned
or
unearned,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
sort
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,--
mr.
russell.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
in
other
words,
the
rate
that
was
offered,
they
said
you
pay
2
points
and
you
get
a
rate
of
8
percent.
and
you
are
saying
that
even
if
they
didn't
pay
the
2
points,
they
would
still
get
a
rate
of
8
percent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
o'connell.
mr.
hefferon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
there
could
be
an
earned
kickback.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
okay
to
get
money
for
a
referral,
what
type
of
kickback
is
not
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
you
were
you
about
to
tell
us
what
we
said
in
long
island
home.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
--
putting
aside
the
notice-and-comment
point,
which
i
think
is
at
least
ambiguous,
which
--
which
of
our
cases
stands
for
the
proposition
that
whether
or
not
we
give
chevron
deference
depends
on
the
thoroughness
with
which
the
agency
addressed
an
issue,
rather
than
simply
an
announcement
of
its
interpretation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
russell,
you
have
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1042,
freeman
versus
quicken
loans.
