mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
passing
respa
in
1974,
congress
was
stepping
into
the
middle
of
a
primarily
local
market
controlled
by
state
law.
the
statute
shows
that
in
doing
so
congress
tread
carefully.
it
did
primarily
two
things
in
the
area
of
settlement
charges.
first,
its
major
reform
was
to
standardize
and
increase
disclosure
of
charges,
including
requiring
a
written
estimate
of
charges
to
be
given
to
people
weeks
before
the
closing.
that
in
fact
was
done
here.
second,
as
respa's
finding
and
purposes
section
tells
us,
congress
found
that
some
consumers
needed
particular
protection
from
a
particular
market
failure.
and
i'm
quoting
from
section
2601
in
the
first
page
of
the
blue
brief,
quote:
"unnecessarily
high
settlement
charges
caused
by
certain
abusive
practices
that
have
developed
in
some
areas
of
the
country.
"
congress
identified
those
as
kickbacks
and
referral
fees.
but
in
1974,
congress
went
no
farther.
it
rejected
proposals
for
direct
price
regulation
which
had
been
proposed
in
both
house
and
senate.
congress
did
recognize
more
legislation
might
be
necessary
and
that
price
controls
might
be
advisable,
and
so
it
sent
hud
out
to
do
a
study
and
report
back.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
it
does
two
things.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
transactions
that
relate
to
charges
actually
paid
at
the
closing,
it
eliminates
the
need
to
prove
an
agreement.
all
it
--
all
it
says
is
that
there
will
be
a
violation
if
you
follow
the
money
and
the
money
ends
up
in
the
hands--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--because
(a)
covers
an
entire
universe
of
things
which
appear,
in
many
instances,
away
from
the
closing
table.
for
example,
an
agreement
between
an
attorney
and
a
developer
that
the
attorney
says
i
will
do
all
the
title
work
on
the
raw
land
for
this
development
if
you
later
on
send
me
the
closings
when
you
build
on
the
land
and
sell
the
particular
parcels.
if
there
was
no
agreement
requirement,
agreement
for
referral,
if
that
did
not
appear
in
(a),
then
any
relationship
between
two
people
in
the
settlement
service
business
would
be
presumptively
a
kickback.
and
so,
you
had
to
have
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
congress
has
decided
that
that
is
not
something
that
should
be
compensable
as
part
of
the
real
estate
business.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
you
don't
need
to
prove
one.
i
think
all
parties
here--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
covered
by
section
8(b).
in
most
--
in
section
2607(b).
in
most
instances,
it
would
probably
be
provable
as
a
kickback
under
2607(a)
since
in
normal
circumstance
one
doesn't
give
all
of
one's
fee
away
unless
there
is
something
else
going
on,
typically
in
this
instance
a
referral.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
again,
congress
was
trying
to
take
a
measured
step
here
because
it
was
for
the
first
time
stepping
into
this
local
market.
congress
left
state
law
remedies
alone.
in
fact,
the
preemption
provision--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--if
the
court
would
find
that
100
percent,
then
we
would
agree
with
judge
higginbotham
that
it
would
--
that
liability
would
not
go
any
further
than
a
situation
where
the
person
performed
no
services
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
it
--
it
--
it--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--justice
scalia,
there
is
no
indication
that
we
are
aware
of
in
the
legislative
history
that
such
a
thing
was
happening.
what
congress--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--it
--
it
--
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
common
arrangement
if
those
subsidiaries
are
rendering
services
in
connection
with
the
real
estate--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--again,
there
is
no
indication--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
type
of
conduct
was
going
on,
and
congress
was
specifically
identifying
kickbacks
and
referral
fees
which
it
referred
to,
for
example,
as
rebates
and
commissions,
unearned
commissions.
and
the
type
of
conduct
which
congress
meant
to
address
was
set
forth
in
this
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history
and
it,
of
course,
deputized
hud
to
do
a
study
to
see
if
more
needed
to
be
done.
it
recognized
that
full
payments
may
implicate
the
issue
of
ratesetting
and
that
perhaps
that's
something
that
should
be
done,
but
it
wasn't
going
to
be
done
at
this
point.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
well,
congress
made
the
decision
at
the
time,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
that
a
fee
for
referral
is
--
is
not
properly
earned.
and
the
definition
for
the
entire
section,
the
title
is
"kickbacks
and
unearned
fees".
that
refers
to
the
entire
section,
(a)
and
(b).
all
agree
that
2607(b)
frequently
is
implicated
if
there
is
a
kickback,
so
it
can't
be
that
the
first
word
applies
only
to
(a)
and
the
second
word
only
to
(b).
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
there
could
be
--
there
could
be
an
earned
kickback
if
congress
was
willing
to
accept
the
principle
that
it's
okay
to
earn
money
for
a
referral.
that
--
congress
rejected,
rejected
the
principle
that
it's
okay
to
get
a
--
to
pay
a
kickback.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
well,
it's
--
let
me
be
clear.
congress
made
the
policy
decision
it
is
not
okay
to
pay
a
kickback
or
any
money
in
order
to
get
a
pure
referral,
and,
therefore,
said
that
in
section
(a)
and
section
(b)
it
is
not
proper
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
it
certainly
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
agree
with
that.
and
hud
is
given
the
authority
--
now
the
bureau,
previously
hud
--
is
given
authority
to
interpret
the
statute.
in
this
instance,
there's
not
a
--
the
policy
statement
should
not
be
due
special
deference
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
incomplete.
it
purports
to
be
an
interpretation
of
this
statute,
and
it
only
touches
very
briefly
and
very
generally
on
the
language.
all
the
words
that
we
have
all
spent
a
lot
of
time
working
on
in
this
case,
hud
says
very
little
about
that.
it
also
doesn't--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--because
it,
it
did
not
treat
the
subject
with
the
kind
of
depth
that
you
would
expect
or
that
this
court
would
want.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
what
the
agency
did
on
that
point
is
it
simply
said
that
if
one
construes
it
the
way
they
would
like
to
construe
it,
it
would
address
the
concern
that
congress
had
for
unnecessarily
high
settlement
charges.
it
provided
no
empirical
or
experiential
explanation
for
why
that
was
the
case.
it
didn't
say
that
this
type
of
practice
was
going
on;
didn't
say
that
the
interpretation
was
going
to
address
it.
furthermore,
it
didn't
deal
with
the
fact
that
its
interpretation
also
was
going
to
sweep
in
price
control
and
what
effect
that
would
be.
in
other
words,
the
agency
did
not
--
did
not
do
the
types
of
things
that
would
cause
this
court
to
defer
to
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
--
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
and
it
is
particularly
difficult,
it
seems
to
us,
to
give
a
policy
statement
deference
because
in
order
to
get
to
the
policy
statement
you
have
to
assume
the
statute's
ambiguous
and
then
assume
the
regulation's
ambiguous,
and
then
you
get
to
the
--
the
policy
statement.
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
impress
upon
the
agency
to
be
quite
clear
and
to
be
quite
solicitous
of
defendant's
rights
to
make
sure
that
it
doesn't
interpret
this
statute
broader
than
what--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--we
absolutely
have,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
justice
breyer,
the
regulatory
history
around
this
section,
which
is
in
regulation
x,
is
actually
quite
interesting
and
quite
favorable
to
the
reading
the
fifth
circuit
gave
to
the
statute.
the
regulation
does
appear
in
15a
and
16a
of
the
blue
brief.
when
it
was
proposed,
there
was
no
discussion
whatsoever
that
suggested
that
hud
was
going
to
actually
legislate
or
regulate
about
the
statute.
it
merely
at
the
time
it
was
proposed,
the
regulation
was
going
to
be
to
recite
section
2607(b),
and
that's
it.
it
referred
to
the
section
as
being
a
fee-splitting
section.
when
the
final
rule
was
issued,
there
were
three
additional
sentences
added
in
this
part
of
the
regulation.
there
was
no
explanation
for
those
three
sentences,
with
the
exception
of
hud's
general
comment
that
it
made
other
changes
in
this
part
of
this
regulation
in
order
to
address
what
services--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--sure.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
it
says
that
in
the
policy
statement,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
in
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--that's
correct.
the
1992
regulation
is
entitled
"no
split
of
charges
other
than
for
actual
services.
"
and
so
we
read
the
regulation
and
believe
hud
at
the
time
read
the
regulation
as
again
merely
repeating
the
idea
that
this
was,
this
section
was
a
limited
section
consistent
with
congress's--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--absolutely
correct,
justice
breyer.
notice
was
not
given
that
that
was
going
to
be
put
into
the
regulation.
as
this
court
noted
in
long
island
care
at
home--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--i
don't
know
whether
comment
--
i
don't
know
comment
was
received
or
not.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
final
rule
when
it
discussed
comments
that
that
issue
was
commented
upon.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
in
long
island
care
at
home,
the
court
merely
repeated
in
particular
statements
made
in
chevron
and
mead
that,
among
other
things,
a
regulation
cannot
get
deference
unless
it
--
if
it
is
procedurally
defective.
in
this
instance
--
and
it
talked
about
the
fact
that
circumstances
sometimes
arises
when
a
notice
of
proposed
rule
doesn't
give
the
public
a
notice
that
there
is
going
to
be
something
happening
so
there
is
no
comment
given
on
a
particular
subject.
and
in
this
instance,
that's
precisely
what
occurred,
which
is
one
reason
why
regulation
x
should
not
get
special
deference
from
this
court.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
well,
there
is
not
a
procedural
defect.
the
issue
is
really
a
question
of
which
how
much
deference
to
give
the
agency
when
it
gives
the
interpretation.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
correct,
as
well
as
if
it
is,
whether
one
gives
chevron
deference.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
sure.
what
it
is,
is
--
it
is
incomplete;
it
doesn't
give
a
--
an
effective
statutory
analysis.
it
doesn't
really
give
any
effective
policy
analysis.
it's
also
inaccurate
in
that
it
attempts
to
recount
that
this
is
a
--
a
reading
which
is
of
long
standing,
when
we
believe,
and
we
cite
in
the
red
brief--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--it
attempts
to
explain
why
it
is
a
finding
--
a
ruling
of
long
standing,
and
we
point
out
examples
in
the
red
brief
where
it
isn't
a
finding
of
--
an
interpretation
of
long
standing.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
i
believe
that
that
was
--
i
believe
that
that
was
a
factor
that
the
court
looked
at
in
long
island
care
at
home.
but
the
question
for
the
court
in
this
instance
is,
should
it
give
this
policy
statement
deference?
if
it
doesn't
qualify
for
chevron
deference,
then
the
question
is,
does
it
have
the
power
to
persuade?
part
of
the
power
to
persuade
is
its
thoroughness.
as
skidmore
itself
says,
the
detail
in
which
it
addresses
things,
how
it
addresses
arguments
on
the
other
side,
and
what
it
says
about
those
arguments.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
on
the
policy
statement?
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
if
the
court
then
also
finds
that
it's
deserving
of
chevron
deference,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
sure.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that
--
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
it
--
and
it
would
be
quite
an
odd
result
for
this
court
to
find
that
the
policy
statement
effected
some
kind
of
price
controlled
direct
rate
regulation
regime
when
that
was
specifically
rejected
by
congress
in
1974.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
we
agree
that
in
each
instance,
the
court
would
have
to
make
a
factual
determination.
but
it
comes
back
to
what
congress
intended
in
1974.
it
specifically
identified
that
it
was
attempting
to
address
certain
abusive
practices
that
had
arisen
in
some
areas.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
with
respect
to
settlement
service
providers.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
provide
chevron
--
actually
provide
deference,
if
chevron
was
applicable?
if
chevron's
applicable
to
policy
statement,
the
policy
statement
does
not
deserve
chevron
deference
because
it
is
an
irrational
reading
of
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
cover
the
kinds
of
direct
regulation
that
the
policy
statement
suggests
that
it
cover.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
well,
the
statute
does
give
hud
interpretive
authority,
but
in
this
instance,
what
it
is
doing
--
in
fact,
it's
not
quite
clear
what
words
it
is
interpreting
in
a
way,
trying
to
--
trying
to
interpret
the
words,
and
any
vague
aspects
of
the
words
--
is
not
a
gap-filling
situation
that
we're
talking
about.
congress
reasonably
in
this
statute,
as
well
as
in
the
truth
in
lending
act,
provided
that
the
agency
would
have
interpretive
authority.
a
lot
of
what
this
agency
was
going
to
be
doing
with
respect
to
this
statute
is
filling
a
lot
of
gaps.
it's
going
to
create
the
special
information
booklet.
it's
going
to
create
these
forms
that
i
referred
to.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
certainly,
most
agencies
would
think--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--i
don't
believe
it
has
to
be
specifically
conferred.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
i
don't
believe
the
court's
precedents
suggest
that
it's
increased
if
congress
has
gone
the
next
step
to
actually
say
"you
have
the
authority
to
interpret
the
statute.
"
the
question
is,
for
purposes
of
--
of
deference,
is
what
is
the
question?
the
question
that
hud
sometimes
--
that
hud
is
deciding
what
form
should
go
on
the
form,
then
that's
interstitial
lawmaking,
and
that's
certainly
something
that
might
get
more
deference
than
if
a
question
is
interpreting
the
legal
effect
of
these
words
that
appear
in
2607(b),
it
is
not
--
it's
not
a
definition;
they're
not
purporting
to
apply
a
definition;
they're
not
filling
a
gap.
and
so
this
is
--
this
is
not
where
you
would
look
towards
a
chevron
deference.
but
congress
is
not
expecting
that
--
that
hud
would,
after
it
has
decided
not
to
allow
direct
regulation
of
charges,
that
hud
would
nonetheless
try
to
do
it
through
the
back
door
through
the
interpretative--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--the
nature
of
the
question
that
hud's
addressing
is
interpreting
the
legal
--
basically
giving
a
legal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
really
purport
to
give
a
policy
interpretation
of
the
statute
because
it
simply
refers
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--but
it
is
a
--
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
--
whether
they
intended
hud
to
be
giving
the
interpretation,
or
filling
a
gap,
or
whether
it
was
simply
getting
guidance.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
hud
issued
the
policy
statement
as
a
guidance
document.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
your
honor,
you
actually
don't
find
either.
what
you
find
is
complaints
about
providers
doing
things
between
each
other,
and
a
recognition
that
ultimately,
the
consumers
perhaps
unknowingly
are
being
harmed
by
that.
the
senate
report
and
house
report
both
described
that
in
great
detail.
we
are
talking
about
rebates,
commissions,
unearned
commissions
and
kickbacks
and
referral
fees.
that's
what
congress
identified
in
2601
as
the
"certain
abusive
practices"
that
had
arisen
in
some
areas
of
the
country.
this
was
not
meant
to
be
a
panacea.
state
law
remedies
stayed
in
place.
and
in
fact
if
you
look
at
most
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases
that
give
rise
to
these
--
this
circuit
split,
they
all
also
bring
a
claim
under
state
law,
whether
it's
fraud
or
contract
or
unjust
enrichment.
that
only
drives
the
point
home
that
it
is
not
irrational
for
congress
to
have
decided
when
it
was
taking
a
step
into
this
area
for
the
first
time
to
actually
legislate
an
important
area,
but
not
go
all
the
way,
and
instead
leave
other
remedies
in
place.
and
that's
what
the
proper
reading
of
this
statute
should
be;
that's
the
reading
the
fifth
circuit
gave
it
as
well.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
thank
you,
justice
ginsburg.
actually
i
didn't
give
a
complete
answer
now
that
i
recall.
it
does
cover
--
the
best
example
is
the
classic
reason
why
the
--
this
section
was
put
in,
in
the
first
place,
why
it
was
proposed;
and
that
would
be
an
unearned
commission.
title
insurance
companies
at
the
time
would
enter
into
commission
agreements
with
agents
where
the
agent
would
get
10
percent
of
the
title
premium;
in
exchange
the
agent
would
do
the
title
work.
in
a
situation,
if
the
title
agent
in
fact
didn't
do
the
title
work,
it
would
be
receiving
an
unearned
fee,
that
is,
part
of
the
title
insurance
commission,
for
no
work.
and
that,
however,
would
not
normally
be
covered
under
(a)
because
the
agreement,
the
underlying
agreement
to
give
the
commission
was
not
to
refer
business;
it
was
actually
to
do
some
of
the
title
work.
so
that
situation
would
be
covered,
but
most
situations,
as
i
think
all
parties
agree,
is
this
statute
is
--
is
typically
a
kickback,
it
just
simply
removes
the
agreement
requirement.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
that's
correct.
so
in
sum,
the
elements
of
the
fifth
circuit's
interpretation
are
all
supportive
of
our
view,
that
is,
that
the
language,
the
structure,
the
context
and
the
history
of
this
statute
all
show
that
it
is
important
but
it's
limited;
and
it
does
not
address
direct
charges
made
by
lenders,
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
it
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
if
the
--
i
think
the
question
was
in
the
context
of
the
title
agent
doing
the
title
work.
if
an
appraiser
was
charging
--
was
charging
the
consumer
directly,
not
doing
the
work,
it
would
not
violate
the
statute,
again,
because
the
statute
requires
two
providers--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--if
--
if
the
bank
arranged--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--if
the
bank
arranged
for
a
title
searcher
to
do
title
work,
and
then
the
bank
charged
the
consumer,
and
then
it
split
the
charge
with
the
title
searcher--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--not
under
2607(b)
and
perhaps
under--
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--state
law,
i
would
assume
so.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
hefferon
--thank
you.
