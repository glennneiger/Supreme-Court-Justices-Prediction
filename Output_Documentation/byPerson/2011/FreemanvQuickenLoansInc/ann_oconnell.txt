ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plain
terms
of
section
2607(b)
prohibit
two
give
two
separate
actions,
giving
an
unearned
fee
and
accepting
one.
sometimes
the
statute
will
be
violated
when
an
unearned
fee
is
collected
from
the
consumer
and
then
shared
between
two
service
providers.
but
the
statute
is
also
violated
when
a
service
provider
collects
an
unearned
fee
directly
from
the
consumer
and
retains
the
entire
fee
for
itself.
ms.
ann
o'connell
we
agree
with
the
petitioner's
interpretation--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
this
is
in
the
brief.
ms.
ann
o'connell
the
explanation
is
encompassed
in
hud's
policy
statement.
footnote
6
of
the
policy
statement,
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
33a,
says
that
hud
would
be
unlikely
to
bring
an
enforcement
action
against
consumers
for
the
payment
of
unearned
fees.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
more
than
just
prosecutorial
discretion.
what
hud
is
explaining--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--what
hud
is
explaining
is
that
the
reason
why
it
wouldn't
prosecute
a
consumer
is
because
the
consumer
does
not
make
the
payment
for
--
does
not
pay
a
fee
for
the
payment
of
unearned
fees.
ms.
ann
o'connell
no,
no.
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
just
prosecutorial
discretion.
this
is
hud's
interpretation
of
the
statute
laid
out
in
a
policy
statement
saying
it
doesn't
think
consumers
violate
the
statute
because
there--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--hud
has
an
expertise
in
determining
what
is
earned
and
unearned
and
what
the
practices
are
in
the
real
estate
industry
for
charging
consumers
fees
that
haven't
been
earned
by
the
service
providers.
what
hud
is
saying--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yeah,
it
was
saying
that
it
doesn't
think
that
a
consumer
violates
the
statute
because
the
consumer
doesn't
pay
the
fee
other
than
for
services
earned.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
important,
important
point
here
is
that
this
is
not
an
overcharge
case;
this
is
an
unearned
fee
case.
overcharges
are
included
in
the
2001
policy
statement,
but
there
is
a
basis
in
the
statute
to
differentiate
between
overcharges
and
unearned
fees,
and
hud
has
long
taken
the
position
that
undivided
unearned
fees,
a
fee
for
which
no
service
is
performed,
violates
section
2607(b).
ms.
ann
o'connell
at
some
point,
under
anybody's
interpretation
there
does
have
to
be
a
determination
of
whether
something
was
earned.
but
there
is
a
statutory
basis
to
distinguish
between
an
unearned
fee
and
an
overcharge
in
that
the
service
has
to
be
--
the
fee
has
to
be
other
than
for
services
actually
performed.
ms.
ann
o'connell
there--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no.
justice--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--under
the
statute,
if
it's
for
--
if
the
fee
is
for
--
other
than
for
services
actually
performed,
which
we
think
the
loan
discount
fee
in
this
case
was
a
charge
other
than
for
a
service
actually
performed,
there
was
no
corresponding
reduction
in
the
interest
rate,
that
is
an
unearned
fee
under
--
under
anybody's
interpretation.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
kagan,
we
agree
that
that
is
one
scenario
covered
by
2607(b).
we
don't
think
it's
the
only
scenario
covered
by
the
statute.
under
our
interpretation
and
petitioner's
interpretation,
there
doesn't
have
to
be
both
a
culpable
giver
and
accepter.
so
once
the
charge
is
received
from
the
consumer
and
accepted
by
the
service
provider,
that
is
also
a
violation
of
the
statute.
it
also
does
cover
fees
that
are
split
between
two
service
providers,
as
you
say
the
giving
and
accepting,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
involve
two
service
providers
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
case
we
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
--
has
to
say
anything
about
overcharges
and
whether
those
are
covered
by
the
statute.
the
fee
in
this
case
was
a
loan
discount
fee,
which
is
generally
paid
to
procure
a
reduction
in
the
interest
rate
of
the
loan,
and
it
procured
nothing
for
the
petitioners.
it
was
a
completely
unearned
fee.
it
was
other
than
for
services
actually
performed.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
our
understanding
is
that
when
the
petitioners
in
this
case
got
a
quote
for
their
mortgage
loan
from
quicken
over
the
phone
at
a
particular
interest
rate
with
no
mention
of
points,
when
it
came
time
to
pay
the
settlement
charges
they
were
charged
a
loan
discount
fee,
charged
points
to
procure
that
particular
interest
rate.
that
is
something
that
would
have
to
be
figured
out
on
remand,
whether
there
actually
should
have
been
a
charge
or
whether
those
points
were
included
in
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--what
--
what
respa
is
intended
to
do
is
to
protect
consumers
who
often
are
not
sophisticated
on
what
they
are
doing
in
securing
a
residential
mortgage
loan
and
to
make
sure
that
they
understand
what
the
charges
are,
and
also
to
ensure
that
they
receive
the
charges
--
the
services
for
which
they
pay
at
closing.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
this
case
comes
here
under
the
assumption
that
this
was
an
unearned
fee.
if
that's
something
the
court
is
concerned
about,
it's
something
--
it
could
still
decide
the
question
presented,
and
then
the
lower
court
could
figure
that
out
on
remand,
whether
this
was
earned
or
not.
