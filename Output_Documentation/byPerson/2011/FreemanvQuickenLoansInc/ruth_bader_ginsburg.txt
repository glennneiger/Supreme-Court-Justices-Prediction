mr.
russell,
when
you
say
the
agency
in
charge,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
hud
and
its
successor,
they
don't
have
any
suit-commencement
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
injunctive
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
but
the
purchaser
is
the
giver.
the
statute
reads
"no
person
shall
give
and
no
person
shall
accept.
"
the
acceptor
is
the
loan
company.
the
person
who
is
giving
would
be
the
consumer,
the
customer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
so
the
person
who
gives
is
--
is
not
answerable
under
your
reading
of
this
(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
we'd
have
quicken
as
the
giver
and
the
person
who
receives
the
referral
or
the
kickback
as
the
receiver.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
russell,
there
is
one
puzzling
aspect
of
your
interpretation.
it
would
be
a
rather
large
thing
for
congress
to
say
we're
going
to
cover
overcharges,
as
i
believe
hud
says
is
so,
and
yet
in
the
purposes
of
the
act
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
it
says
nothing
about
overcharges,
nothing
about
payment
for
service
not
received
in
the
four.
"it
is
the
purpose
of
the
act
to.
"
and
then
there
are
four
things
listed
and
none
of
those
say
to
stop
charges
for
services
that
weren't
performed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is,
that
is
hud's
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
now
splitting
hud's
position.
hud's
position
says
overcharges
are
reached
by
the
statute.
you
say
not
overcharges,
but
only
a
fee
when
no
service
is
performed.
so
why
couldn't
the
customers
have
said,
there
is
a
fee
for
the
service
performed,
that's
the
reasonable
fee,
and
the
rest
of
it
is
a
charge
for
service
not
performed?
i
mean,
can
you
maintain
that
distinction
between
an
overcharge
and
a
fee
for
services
that
are
not
performed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
is
the
statute
labeled,
titled,
"prohibition
against
kickbacks"
--
that's
one
thing
--
"and
unearned
fees"?
how
do
you
--
what
does
2607?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
give
a
complete
answer
to
the
question
what
does
(b)
cover
that
(a)
does
not?
so
one
--
one
suggestion
that
is
made
is
well,
you
didn't
--
if
all
this
statute
has
to
do
--
do,
with
is
kickbacks,
then
all
you
need
is
(a)
and
there
is
no
necessity
for
(b).
you
said
one
thing
was
contract,
approving
a
contract,
and
not
--
is
there
anything
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that
in
the
policy
statement?
the
difference
between
unearned
and--
