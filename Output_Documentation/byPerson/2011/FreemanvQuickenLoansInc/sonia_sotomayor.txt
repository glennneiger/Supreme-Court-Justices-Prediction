justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
under
your
reading,
as
i
understand
it,
the
words
"portion,
split
or
percentage"
means
an
amount
less
than
the
whole?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
happens
if
a
service
provider
gives
100
percent
to
the
other
side,
as
opposed
to
an
amount
less
than
the
whole?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
make
much
sense,
that
if
you
give
one
meaning
--
if
you
stay
consistent
with
your
meaning,
what
you
are
saying
is
a
situation
where
the
service
provider
gives
away
everything,
100
percent,
they
are
just
not
liable
under
(b);
if
they
give
away
1
percent,
they
are
--
if
they
keep
1
percent,
they
are
liable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
--
is
--
is
there
--
judge
higginbotham,
in
his
dissent,
said
there
is
a
big
difference
between
unearned
fees
and
overcharge
fees.
he
said
unearned
fees,
in
their
simplest
form,
is
no
service
whatsoever.
overcharges
are
some
service,
but
an
excessive
value.
what
is
wrong
with
that
definition?
why
is
that
definition
unworkable
in
terms
of
limiting
and
defining
this
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
think
not?
how
about
with
subsidiaries?
wasn't
it
common
practice
--
isn't
it
common
practice
that
subsidiaries
are
often
receiving
parts
of
the
payments
because
then
they
become
--
they
come
out
of
the
gross
income
of
the
major
parent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
it
a
potential
common
practice
that
they
are
getting
100
percent
of
something
they
didn't
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
they
are
rendering
--
if
they
are
already
rendering
services?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
your
reading
of
the
language
is
not
plain,
if
there
are
two
ways
to
read
this
statute,
give
me
your
best
reason
for
why
the
policy
statement
should
not
be
given
deference.
i
know
you
said
because
it
didn't
go
through
notice
--
through
notice;
but
outside
of
that,
why
isn't
this
a
hud
interpretation
that
the
statute
tells
us
hud
can
do,
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
can
argue
about
whether
it's
an
interpretation
of
regulation
x
or
not,
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
entitled
to
deference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
second
circuit
had
said
something
a
lot
different,
and
hud
came
back
and
invited
hud
to
do
something,
and
hud
came
back
and
said:
you
read
it
that
way;
we
think
this
is
a
better
reading.
what
more
do
we
need
from
an
agency?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
sorry.
may
i
just
correct
you
on
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
didn't
hud
in
that
preamble
say
explicitly,
"the
secretary,
charged
by
statute
with
interpreting
respa,
interprets
18(b)
to
mean
that
two
persons
are
not
required?
"
it
says
that
explicitly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
in
the
policy
statement;
in
the
preamble
to
regulation
x.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in,
in
1996.
i
thought
that
was
the
final
rulemaking
you
were
talking
about,
because
it
didn't
do
rulemaking
with
respect
to
the
policy
statement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
not
sure.
congress
didn't
say
that
hud
could
only
give
interpretations
through
rules.
it
said
it
could
give
rules,
pass
rules
and
regulations,
and
give
interpretations.
so
what's
the
procedural
defect
in
it
just
giving
an
interpretation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
go
back
to
whether
the
policy
--
whether
the
policy
--
whether
the
statute
is
ambiguous
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
what's
the
deficiency
in
the
policy
statement
that's
independent
of
the
ambiguity
you
rely
upon.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
says
it's
longstanding
for
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
under
your
interpretation
or
theirs,
the
court
gets
involved
in
determining
whether
fees,
services
were
rendered.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
your
interpretation
is
going
to
keep
the
court
out
of
that
business.
to
be
able
to
find
a
kickback,
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
services
were
rendered
or
not.
so
what's
the
difference
in
that
inquiry
when
it
involves
a
kickback
and
when
it
involves
a
single
provider?
in
a
kickback
situation,
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
there
was
actually
a
service
rendered
that
entitled
the
person
to
a
percentage
or
not;
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference
between
deciding
that
question
and
deciding
that
the
--
the
one
individual
provided
a
service?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it
listed,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
unearned
fees.
why
would
it
matter
to
congress?
give
me
a
reason
that
it
would
matter
to
congress
whether
the
unearned
fee
was
by
one
person
in
a
dual
relationship
or
a
single
person
alone?
the
issue
was
unearned
fees.
rendering
--
charging
for
a
service
you
didn't
render.
that's
what
the
whole
kickback
idea
was
about,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question?
if
a
--
if
a
bank
has
an
appraisal
fee
from
the
past
and
decides,
i
don't
need
a
new
one,
but
still
charges
you
for
an
appraisal
fee,
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
if
the
bank
charged
you
for
a
title
search
that
it
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it
had
one
already?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
so,
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
if
the
provider
decides
i'm
going
to
use
what
i
had
before;
i'm
not
going
to
redo
the
work,
but
still
charges
you
a
second
time,
they
are
not
liable
under
your
reading
of
the
statute?
