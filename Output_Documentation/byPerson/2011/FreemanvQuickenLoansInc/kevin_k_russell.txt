mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
decades,
the
agency
congress
charged
with
administering
the
real
estate
settlement
procedures
act
has
construed
that
statute
as
prohibiting
a
lender
from
accepting
a
charge
for
a
real
estate
settlement
service
it
didn't
provide,
whether
it
accepts
that
charge
directly
from
a
consumer
or
indirectly
through
another
service
provider,
and
whether
it
shares
that
fee
with
another
provider
or
keeps
it
all
for
itself.
that
interpretation
is
eminently
reasonable
and
is
entitled
to
deference.
and
in
fact--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--hud
does
have
authority
to
bring
suits
for
injunctive
relief
for
violations
of
2607(b),
and
--
if
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
for
injunctive
relief,
that's
correct.
and
that
agency
has
long
construed
the
language
of
this
provision
as
--
as
reaching
all
unearned
fees
whether
divided
or
not,
and
that
interpretation
of
the
language
we
think
is
eminently
reasonable.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
all
unearned
fees.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
whether
they're
split
or
not.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
you're
right.
i
do
think
it's
a
side
issue
because
the
courts
below
didn't
decide
that,
and
quicken--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
you
can
take
it
on
the
same
assumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
that
the
fee
was
unearned,
and
decide
the
question
presented.
but
to
answer
your
question,
congress
amended
the
statute
specifically
to
overrule
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
graham,
which
held
that
loan
discount
fees
were
not
covered
by
the
statute
--
in
that
case
involving
a
kickback.
i
know
quicken
argues
that
that
case
involved
origination
fees.
we
don't
think
that's
correct.
but
this
is
--
this
is
an
issue
you
could
have
an
entire
case
about,
but--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--the
argument
is
congress
specifically
defined
the
term
"real
estate
settlement
service"
to
include
the
origination
of
the
loan,
which
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
the
funding
of
the
loan.
and
it
did
that
in
order
to
encompass
kickbacks,
at
the
very
least,
involving
loan
discount
points,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
in
graham.
now,
you
can
have
debates
--
and
we
will
have
in
this
case
eventually
--
debates
about
what
does
it
mean
for
a
loan
discount
fee
to
be
unearned.
but
for
present
purposes,
the
circuit
split
arose
here
in
the
much
more
common
circumstance,
when
there
are
unearned
fees
for
appraisals
and
courier
fees,
and
--
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
decided
on
the
basis
of.
and
it
did
so--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
i
don't
think
you're
precluded
from
considering
--
i--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--right.
i--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--there
are
several
reasons.
one
is
the
lower
courts
did
not
address
this
question.
quicken
hasn't
briefed
it
to
any
extent.
quicken
doesn't
ask
you
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
that
question.
we
haven't
briefed
it.
it's
a
complicated
question
that
involves
interpretation
of
another
provision
of
the
statute
that
congress
amended
to
deal
specifically
with
this
problem.
and
it
wouldn't
solve
--
it
wouldn't
resolve
the
circuit
conflict
that
the
court
granted
cert
to
decide.
and
so
if
i
could
turn
to
that,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
6a
of
the
--
the
blue
brief,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
lender
who
charges
an
unearned
fee
accepts
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
a
portion,
split
or
percentage,
i.e.,
100
percent,
of
a
charge
that
was
made
for
the
rendering
of
a
covered
real
estate
settlement
service
other
than
for
services
actually
performed.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
"portion"
is
the
word
that
best
fits
this
situation.
and
congress
has
used
the
phrase
portion
in
other
state
--
in
other
statutes
to
prohibit,
for
example,
a
public
official
from
converting
to
personal
use
any
portion
of
the
funds
entrusted
to
him.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
two
things
about
that.
one
is
that
when
you
have
a
statute
that
forbids
somebody
from
taking
any
portion
of
something,
i
think
the
ordinary
understanding
is
that
prohibits
them
from
taking
the
whole
of
the
thing.
the
embezzlement
statutes
are
an
example
of
that.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
canon,
though,
i
don't
think,
is
a
canon
that
says
when
you
have
related
words,
you
give
all
them
the
same
meaning.
they
certainly
have
something
in
common.
they
are
all
the
measure
of
something,
but
the
canon
doesn't
mean
you
read
them
all
to
mean
the
same
measure
of
something,
which
would
run
headlong
i
think
into
the
canon
against
construing
statutes
to
have
surplusage.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
you
still
have
to
decide
when
you
are
talking
about
a
kickback
whether
the
person
who
received
the
kickback
has
done
anything
to
earn
their
portion
of
it.
and
so
i
don't
think
you
avoid
the
question
of
what
does
it
mean
for
a
fee
to
be
unearned
entirely.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
but--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it's
certainly
harder
to
sort
out
with
respect
to
loan
discount
fees.
but
the
run
of
the
mine
cases
here
involve
things
like
appraisals,
courier
services,
flood
certifications--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
that
--
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
what
protect
consumers
is
the
last
words
of
--
of
this
provision,
which
creates
a
safe
harbor
for
people
who
give
or
accept
charges
for
services
actually
performed.
and
the
critical
word
here
is
"for".
what
a
consumer
is
paying
"for"
is
what
she
has
been
charged
"for".
if
she
has
been
charged
for
an
appraisal,
what
she
is
given
the
charge
for
is
for
the
appraisal.
if
the
appraisal
wasn't
performed,
that
shows
she
didn't
get
what
she
paid
for,
but
it
doesn't
change
what
she
was
paying
"for".
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there
are
two
ways
you
can
construe
what
it
means
to
pay
a
charge
for.
one
is
what
it
is
you
actually
got--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--which
was
nothing.
the
other
is
what
you
are
actually
charged
for,
which
was
the
appraisal.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
and
i
think
that
latter
interpretation--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--is
the
proper
one.
it's
--
i
think
it's
the
most
natural--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--because
she
didn't
pay
for
services
other
than
--
she
didn't
pay
for
services
other
than
services
actually
performed.
what
she
paid
for--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--because
i
think
it's
different,
depending
on
whether
you're
looking
from
the
perspective
of
accepting
or
receiving,
what
the
charge
is
for.
so
for
example,
if
you
were
to
go
to
your
mechanic
and
you
were
charged
for
an
oil
change
but
you
didn't
get
one,
it
would
be
perfectly
natural
for
you
to
say:
i
was
charged
for
and
i
paid
for
an
oil
change.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
i
think
the
consumer
is
paying
a
charge
for
the
--
for
the
courier
service.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
because
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--to
pay
for
a
service
actually
performed.
and
that's
what
she
is
paying
for;
she's
paying
for
an
appraisal.
she's
not
paying
for
nothing.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
correct,
because
what
she
is
giving
the
charge
for
is
what
she
has
been
charged
for.
she
was
charged
for
an
appraisal.
she
is
giving
the
charge
for
an
appraisal,
and
that
doesn't
violate
the
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
in
a
traditional
kickback
situation,
where
quicken
for
example
kicked
back
some
of
the
fee
to
a
real
estate
agent
for
nothing,
for
the
referral
of
the
business,
which
isn't
for
a
service
actually
performed
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
that
would
violate
the
provision.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
this
provision
does
double
duty.
it
is
designed
and
written
broadly
to
encompass
both
traditional
kickback
situations
and
unearned
fee
provisions.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true.
first
just
to
clarify,
we
are
not
arguing
that
it
covers
over
charges
in
the
sense
of
excessive
charges.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
one
of
hud's
interpretations,
although
it's
an
interpretation
about
what
it
means
for
something
to
be
unearned,
not
having
anything
to
do
with
whether
split
fees
are
covered
or
not.
but
to
answer
your
more
specific
question,
we
know
that
that
enumeration
is
not
comprehensive.
there
are
other
things
in
the
statute
that
are
not
included,
and
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
would
be
immense,
but
this
court
doesn't
have
to
accept
that
view
in
order
to
accept
hud's--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--certainly
you
can,
and
in
fact
your
honor
did
in
smith
v.
city
of
jackson,
where
you
held
that
a
provision
of
a
regulation
recognizing
disparate
impact
was
entitled
to
deference,
but
a
provision
saying
what
you
had
to
prove
to
show
a
disparate
impact
violation
wasn't.
and
here
similarly
--
i
mean,
particularly
the
overcharge
part
of
the
interpretation
is
not
even
in
the
regulations.
it's
in
the
policy
statement.
it's
a
subsequent--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
congress
--
yes.
i
mean,
it
is
--
labels
are
important,
because
congress
didn't
say:
you
simply
have
to
disclose
the
bottom
line.
it
said
you
have
to
give
an
itemized
list.
and
requiring
that
those
identified
line
items
actually
represent
services
that
were
actually
rendered
is
a
completely
reasonable
supplement
to
the
disclosure
requirement.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
thank
you.
justice
breyer,
you
had
asked
why
congress
would
engage
in
a
statute
that
gets
at
overcharges
and
there
is
a
rate
regulation
kind
of
thing,
which
is
very
unusual,
and
i
agree
it's
unusual.
that's
a
reason
to
read
this
statute
not
to
do
that,
to
only
get
at
truly
unearned
fees,
which
are
the
equivalent
of
fraudulent
fees,
which
the
law
does
forbid
pervasively.
in
this
case,
congress--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
to
be--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
that
there
was
a
two-step
analysis.
first
step
is
they
decided
that
split
fees
are
not
the
only
thing
that
the
statute
gets
at.
and
then
--
but
this
--
an
unsplit
fee
starts
to
be
unearned,
and
they
had
a
separate
interpretation
of
what
it
means
for
a
fee
to
be
unearned.
at
any
rate--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it's
towards
the
end
where
they
enumerate
the
different
kinds
of
unearned
fees.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you
about
that.
they
list
four
different
--
or
three
or
four
different
kinds
of
charges
that
could
be
unearned.
you
don't
have
to
agree
with
them
with
respect
to
each
of
those
things.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
would--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--sure.
well,
congress
said
its
purpose
was,
was
to
get
at
abusive
practices
that
unnecessarily
increase
the
costs
of
settlement.
what
--
the
legislative
history
was
focused
on
kickbacks,
but
there
were
examples
in
the
hud/va
report
at
page
16
of
that
report
and
in
the
washington
post
articles
about
markups
that
are
a
form
of
undivided,
unearned
fee.
congress
knew
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
this
statute,
hud
has
frequently
found
and
reported
to
congress
instances
of
unearned
fees,
including
those
involving
loan
discount
fees;
and
the
states
--
21
states
have
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
tell
you
that
there
is
a
pervasive
problem
with
settlement
closings
included
padded
charges
for
things
that
were
never
performed.
with
respect
to
the
agency's
interpretation,
i
would
point
you
particularly
to
this
1996
rulemaking
where
the
agency
withdrew
an
exemption
for
certain
payments
between
consumers
and
providers
for
the
use
of
a
particular
kind
of
computer
service.
that
exemption
would
have
been
unnecessary
had
hud
thought,
as
quicken
does,
that
the
statute
only
regulates
transactions
between
providers.
and
in
withdrawing
that
exemption,
hud
explained
in
quite
a
lot
of
detail
that
it
rejected
specifically
that
--
the
split
fee
requirement.
and
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
they
have
grappled
with
this
question
and
that
they
have
explained
why
they
think
that
split
fees
aren't
covered.
the
question
ultimately
is
whether
that's
a
reasonable
conclusion
in
light
of
this
statute--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--they
gave
--
they
gave
the
public
more
notice
than
the
court
found
sufficient
in
long
island
care
at
home,
which
is,
they
told
the
public
this
provision
is
at
issue;
we
are
going
to
issue
an
interpretation
about
it;
and
they
ultimately
did.
in
long
island
care
they
did
the
opposite
of
what
they
had
proposed
to
do,
and
this
court
said
that
was
enough.
in
this
case
--
and
even
in
1996,
they
received
comments
with
respect
to
the
case
law
that
said
that
only
splits
are
required
and
they
said
we
disagree.
