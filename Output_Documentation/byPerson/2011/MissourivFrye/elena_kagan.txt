mr.
koster--
justice
elena
kagan
so
i
think,
mr.
yang,
what
justice
sotomayor
was
suggesting
is
that
your
position
does
in
fact
require
you
to
say
that
if
there
were
no
counsel
at
all
in
the
proceedings,
that
would
be
perfectly
--
that
--
you
know,
there
would
not
be
a
constitutional
problem
with
that.
once
he
pleads
guilty,
it
just
wipes
away
the
fact
that
no
counsel
has
been
appointed
for
him.
justice
elena
kagan
so
does
that
mean,
mr.
yang,
a
state
could
set
up
a
system
where
it
says
we
are
going
to
do
all
our
negotiating
with
the
defendant
with
no
counsel
present
in
the
room,
but
we
are
going
to
keep
a
lawyer
on
board
just
in
the
courtroom
to
advise
him
whether
he
should
plead
--
to
advise
him
about
the
plea
that
he
struck,
even
though
he
struck
this
plea
with
no
counsel
in
the
room,
and
that
would
be
perfectly
okay?
justice
elena
kagan
all
the
negotiations
could
be
uncounseled.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that,
if
you
--
you
know
--
you
are
saying
that;
because
you're
saying
that
in
the
end
the
guilty
plea
wipes
all
constitutional
error
away.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
yang,
there
are
different
kinds
of
unfairness.
one
kind
of
unfairness
is
when
you
are
badly
advised
and
you,
therefore,
waived
your
right
to
trial
and
you
would
have
gone.
but
there
is
another
prejudice,
which
is
you
and
ten
other
guys
are
all
in
the
same
situation
and
those
ten
other
guys
come
up
with
a
favorable
plea
deal
because
their
lawyers
are
paying
attention,
and
you
come
up
with
an
unfavorable
plea
deal
because
your
lawyer
has
fallen
asleep.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
have
an
effective
assistance
right
that
means
something,
that
unfairness
needs
to
be
addressed
by
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
that
is
the
question.
why
isn't
that
the
question?
