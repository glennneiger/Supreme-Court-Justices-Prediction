justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
we've
got
to
be
--
aren't
we
taking
this
on
--
isn't
there
an
assumption
that
there
is
a
finding,
or
some
lower
court
judge
made
a
finding
that
if
he
had
known
about
the
better
deal
that
was
offered,
he
would
have
taken
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
a
causal
problem.
you
are
saying
that,
even
if
he
had
accepted
it,
it
would
have
gone
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
would
have
turned
it
down
anyway,
the
judge
wouldn't
have
accepted
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
there's
a
--
somebody
must
have
found
somewhere
that
this
made
a
difference,
that
the
failure
to
tell
him
about
the
special
offer
of
the
misdemeanor
did
in
fact
make
a
difference
because
he
would
have
accepted
it
and
he
would
have
ended
up
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
on
the
basic
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
the
--
the
question
--
i
make
a
counter-assumption.
the
problem
that
i
--
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
would
like
you
and
the
others
to
comment
on,
is
that
you
are
worried
deeply
about
a
practical
problem,
and
that
the
practical
problem
is
that
it
would
be
too
easy,
as
just
was
suggested
by
the
question,
to
find
that
the
lawyer
after
the
defendant
is
convicted
did
a
bad
job
during
the
plea
negotiation,
in
which
case
everybody
will
get
two
or
three
bites
at
the
apple.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
every
brief
has
been
lifting
the
standards,
particularly
in
respect
to
prejudice,
from
hill,
which
was
addressing
a
different
question.
it
was
addressing
the
question
of
missed
--
bad
performance
by
the
lawyer
at
trial.
and
that
is
hard
to
track
what
the
effects
are.
it
isn't
that
hard
to
say
the
trial
was
unfair,
give
him
a
new
one.
that
won't
work
here,
i
don't
think.
so
suppose
what
we
did,
instead
of
saying
there
was
no
right,
you
simply
said
you
have
to
prove
with
some
certainty,
work
out
a
standard,
that
there
really
was
inadequate
assistance
during
the
plea
bargaining,
and
you
have
to
show
something
more
than
a
reasonable
probability
that
this
would
have
led
to
the
plea,
et
cetera.
you
have
to
show
that
it
would
have
happened.
or
you
have
a
--
in
other
words,
you
have
two
tougher
standards
for
this
area,
but
you
don't
reject
the
idea
of
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
during
the
plea
bargaining
stage.
i
would
like
people's
views
insofar
as
they
are
willing
to
give
them,
on
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
as
a
constitutional
violation
that,
in
a
context
of
a
world
where
95
percent
of
all
people
in
prison
are
there
as
a
result
of
bargaining
and
guilty
pleas
arranged
with
prosecutors,
in
that
context,
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
deprive
a
person
of
his
liberty
for
40
years
instead
of
six
months
because
the
lawyer
which
he
is
guaranteed
fell
down
on
the
basic,
fundamental,
obvious
duty
of
communicating
the
relevant
plea
agreement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
there
any
support
for
me?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
have
read
these
cases,
and
now
we
are
right
on
what
i
think
is
the
point,
because
we've
both
defined
a
possible
constitutional
right
but
there
is
a
practical
problem.
all
right?
now,
the
states
and
others
have
dealt
with
this
on
your
side
for
the
last
30
years
--
and
presumably
you
but
not
me.
i've
read
a
lot
more
cases.
now,
have
they
developed
--
as
you
look
across
those
cases,
are
there
some
states
or
places
that
have
developed
reasonably
tough
standards
in
respect
to
what
counts
as
ineffective
assistance,
and
in
respect
to
whether
it
made
a
difference
that
would
help
to
alleviate
the
concern
that
this
would
turn
into
a
great
mess?
which
it
hasn't,
apparently.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
you
have
to
show
a
causal
connection,
so
you
would
have
to
show
--
show
in
the
causal
connection
that
he
would
have
taken
that
deal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
--
if
you
are
going
to
use
the
words
reasonable
probability
that
he
would
have
taken
it,
it
might
be
fairly
easy
to
show.
and
that's
where
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i'm
thinking
that
maybe
we
want
something
tougher
than
reasonable
probability,
that
you
have
to
show
that
it
really
would
have
made
a
difference.
