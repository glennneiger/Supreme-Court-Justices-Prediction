we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-444,
missouri
v.
frye.
general
koster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
defendant
might
think,
you
know,
there
is
really
bad
evidence
out
there
that
they
don't
have
yet.
and
if
i
--
i
want
to
nail
this
deal
down
as
soon
as
possible.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
reason
to
--
to
move
things
up
and
get
the
plea
in
early,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
often
that
happens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang.
chief

g.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
get
a
lot
of
strickland
cases,
and
the
lower
courts
do,
too.
that's
not
much
comfort
in
terms
of
what
the
consequences
of
a
decision
in
your
favor
would
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'll
go
this
time.
counsel,
on
page
24
of
your
brief
you
quote
alford
for
the
proposition
that
a
valid
plea
must
be
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
choice
among
the
alternative
courses
of
action
open
to
the
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
next
page
you
say
when
frye
entered
his
guilty
plea
before
the
trial
court
he
was
completely
unaware
that
counsel's
ineffective
delay
had
forever
foreclosed
those
options.
now,
i
put
the
two
of
those
together
and
find
you
saying
that
this
was
a
valid
plea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
of
validity
is
whether
it's
an
intelligent
choice,
as
you
quote,
among
the
alternative
choices
of
action
open
to
the
defendant.
the
next
page
you
say
these
options
have
forever
been
foreclosed,
so
they
weren't
open
to
the
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
koster,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
