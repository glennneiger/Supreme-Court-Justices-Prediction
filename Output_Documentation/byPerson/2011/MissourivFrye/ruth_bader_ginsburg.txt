justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
open
plea
that
wasn't
made,
that
is
a
critical
stage,
that
he
took
a
the
plea.
but
he
i
think
has
a
plausible
argument
that
the
plea
he
made,
the
open
plea
with
no
bargain
in
the
picture,
that
that
plea
was
not
intelligently
made
because
he
didn't
know
that
there
had
been
an
offer
for
him
to
plead
to
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
felony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yang,
in
your
view
is
there
any
situation
in
which
a
defendant
could
regain
a
plea
opportunity
that
he
lost
due
to
counsel's
conceded
inadequacy?
and
i
think
it
is
accepted
that
not
telling
him
of
the
plea
offer
was
ineffective
representation.
is
there
any
case
where
the
defendant
could
regain
the
plea
opportunity
that
he
lost?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
if
he
doesn't
seek
the
trial
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
if
he
doesn't
want
to
go
to
trial
and
he
is
going
to
plead
guilty,
is
there
any
circumstance
where
he
could
regain
that
lost
opportunity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
in
what
--
that
the
prosecutor
--
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
order
the
prosecutor
to
renew
that
earlier
plea.
so
they
said
the
options
were,
you
can
get
a
new
trial
--
you
can
get
a
trial
or
you
can
replead
the
open
plea.
but
wasn't
it
--
didn't
the
court
say
we
will
not
order
the
prosecutor
to
reinstate
the
earlier
offer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
--
you
are
leaving
out
of
the
picture
the
prosecutor's
prerogative
to
withdraw
or
flip.
you
said
that
the
court,
that
it
lacked
authority
to
order
the
state
to
offer
any
bargain,
but
also
the
court
said,
i'm
not
going
to
require
the
prosecutor
to
renew
an
earlier
offer.
one
thing
is
clear
in
this
case;
the
prosecutor
did
nothing
wrong.
the
wrong
was
on
the
part
of
defense
counsel.
so
why
should
the
judge
disarm
the
prosecutor,
take
away
the
prosecutor's
right
to
change
his
mind?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
--
is
that
the
question
that
the
court
raised?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
was
expecting
you
to
address.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
--
are
you
recognizing
that
the
remedy
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
give
was
a
futile
remedy,
that
is,
plead
guilty,
to
have
another
open
plea
or
trial,
because
this
defendant
apparently
doesn't
want
to
go
to
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
--
now
that
we
know
what
the
judge's
sentence
was,
and
part
of
the
plea
offer
was
remade,
the
part
about
--
what
was
it,
3
years
versus
10
days
in
jail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
judge
said,
i'm
not
going
to
give
him
just
10
days,
i'm
willing
to
put
him
in
jail
for
the
whole
3
years.
now
if
that
--
this
the
sentence
that
the
judge
gave,
he
rejected
the
--
half
of
the
plea
bargain,
so
surely
he
would
have
rejected
the
more
generous
one.
