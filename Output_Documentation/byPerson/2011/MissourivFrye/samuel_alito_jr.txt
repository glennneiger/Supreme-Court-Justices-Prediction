justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
am
really
puzzled
by
what
as
a
practical
matter
is
at
stake
in
this
case.
under
the
state
court
decision,
the
defendant
has
the
option
of
either
pleading
guilty
to
the
charge
--
in
which
case
he
will
be
right
back
where
he
is
now
--
or
he
can
insist
on
a
trial.
if
he
insists
on
the
trial,
you
need
to
prove
that
he
was
driving
with
a
revoked
license.
that
seems
to
me
--
if
there
ever
was
a
slam
dunk
trial,
that
seems
to
me
that's
the
slam
dunk
trial.
you
introduce
the
records
of
--
showing
that
his
license
was
revoked,
and
you
have
the
officer
testify
that
on
such
and
such
a
date,
he
was
driving.
so
i
--
i
don't
really
see
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
what
is
at
stake
here.
i
don't
see
what
that
--
as
a
practical
matter,
this
seems
to
be
--
to
me
a
case
about
nothing.
am
i
wrong?
am
i
missing
something?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
he
had
snapped
up
this
deal
as
soon
as
it
was
offered.
by
the
time
he
--
he
appeared
before
the
court
to
answer
a
formal
plea
of
guilty,
would
the
court
have
known
that
he
had
in
the
interim
been
arrested
yet
again
for
driving
without
a
license?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
he
had
been
told
that
--
suppose
he
had
been
told
that,
and
the
prosecutor
said,
well,
yes,
that's
true.
i
made
that
offer,
but
it's
off
the
table
now.
and
apparently,
this
was
then
off
the
table.
so
what
good
would
it
have
done
him
to
know
about
something
that
happened
in
the
past
but
was
no
longer
available.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that.
it
may
have
been
unfair,
but
i
don't
see
why
it's
involuntary.
because
i
don't
see
that
--
advising
him
that
he
had
an
option
at
some
point
in
the
past
which
was
no
longer
available
really
doesn't
have
much
of
a
--
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea
to
a
later
less-favorable
offer.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
the
case
goes
to
trial
prejudice
isn't
going
to
be
very
hard
to
prove.
the
person
turned
down
the
5-year
deal
and
gets
--
and
after
trial
is
sentenced
to
20
years.
so
you've
got
--
you're
got
prejudice
right
there,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
there's
always
going
to
be
a
very
good
argument
for
prejudice
where
a
person
turns
down
a
favorable
deal
and
then
gets
slammed
after
a
trial.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
point
is
just
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
point
is
just
that
prejudice
isn't
going
to
be
very
tough
to
show,
is
it?
you
turned
down
a
1-year
deal
and
later
when
that
was
off
the
table,
you
accepted
a
5-year
deal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
prejudice.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
the
issue
of--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--on
the
issue
of
remedy,
as
the
respondent
are
you
not
limited
to
the
remedies
that
were
provided
in
the
judgment
of
the
state
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
didn't
file
a
cross
petition
and
there
wasn't
one
granted.
so
aren't
--
aren't
you
limited
to
defending
the
judgment
below?
can
you
ask
for
a
modification
of
the
judgment
below
in
your
favor?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
that
because
we
added
a
question
that
acts
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
granted
cross
petition,
that
would
permit
modification
of
the
judgment
in
your
favor?
