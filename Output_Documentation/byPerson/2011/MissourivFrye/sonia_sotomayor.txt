justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
sometimes
one's
experience
has
to
be
challenged.
i
for
one
have
never
heard
of
a
case
in
which
parties
are
discussing
a
plea,
except
in
the
most
unusual
of
circumstances,
and
they
advance
a
court
date
to
enter
the
plea.
in
most
cases,
they
just
wait
until
the
court
date
and
tell
the
judge:
i'm
ready
to
plead
guilty.
this
is
such
an
unusual
case,
because
the
plea
happens
on
day
1.
the
courts
below
is
assuming
that
between
day
1
and
day
5,
or
3
or
4,
the
guy
would
have
come
in
and
pled
guilty,
would
have
advanced
the
later
court
date?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
that's
the
second
plea.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
talking
about
the
plea--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--he
commits
the
crime
on
the
29th
or
the
30th.
he
commits
a
second
offense
on
the
29th
or
30th?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
my
--
my
point
is,
how
reasonable
could
it
be
for
the
--
for
a
court
to
assume
that
the
plea
offer
had
been
made
and
that
he
would
have
taken
it
before
the
january
court
date
that
was
set?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
taking
the
same
position
your
--
i
don't
want
to
call
it
co-counsel
--
petitioner's
counsel
is
taking,
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
an
attorney
at
plea
bargaining,
unless
you
waive
your
--
unless
your
right
to
a
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
have
a
two-part
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
what
exactly
made
his
plea
unknowing
or
involuntary,
number
one?
and
number
two,
identify
the
right
he
was
deprived
of,
substantive
or
procedural,
by
his
attorney's
failure
to
communicate
the
plea.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
just
to
make
sure.
i
thought
the
earlier,
the
november
15th
letter
agreement--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--always
left
it
up
to
the
judge
whether
to
accept
either
the
felony
with
shock
treatment
or
misdemeanor
with
90
days.
so
the
judge
was
always
free
to
reject
either
of
those
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
binding
the
judge?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
would
have
had
to
accept
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
he
would
not
have
had
to
accept
the
90
days.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what
proof
would
you
have
in
the
record
that
the
judge
would
have
accepted
the
90
days?
