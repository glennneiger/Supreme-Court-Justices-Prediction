mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
defendant
pleads
guilty--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
we
are
not--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
are
not
taking
the
view.
in
this
case
the
alleged
deficiency
is
really
not
an
interaction
between
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
counsel
in
plea
bargaining.
the
alleged
deficiency
is
a
failure
to
inform
the
defendant
of
things
the
defendant
would
want
to
know
as
going
forward,
and
we're
--
we
are
willing
to
assume
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
properly
informed
by
counsel.
but
with
any
strickland
claim
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
shown
cognizable
prejudice
as
a
result
of
a
deficient
performance
by
the
counsel.
and
when
a
defendant
pleads
guilty
in
open
court,
the
conviction
rests
on
the
defendant's
assertion,
an
admission
of
his
own
guilt,
and
his
consent
that
there
be
judgment
entered,
a
judgment
of
conviction,
entered
without
trial.
and
because
the
conviction
rests
on
a
consent
judgment,
it
wipes
free
antecedent
constitutional
errors.
the
one
challenge
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--a
--
a
guilty
plea
wipes
free
all
kinds
of
constitutional
violations.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
correct.
and
the
guilty
plea--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--correct.
when
the
counseled
guilty
plea
is
entered,
this
court
has
held
that
the
one
remaining
challenge
that
would
be
allowed
is
the
challenge
to
the
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
the
right
to
trial,
which
is
what
the
guilty
plea
is.
now,
in
order
to
show
that
you
are
prejudiced--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
are
not
saying
that
--
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
states
can
deprive
counsel
or
deprive
counsel
from
participation
in
the
guilty
plea
process.
but
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--just
as
we
are
not
saying
that
there
can
be
coerced
confessions,
not
just
like
we
are
saying
that
a
statute
can
impermissibly
burden
the
right
to
trial
by
putting
a
death
sentence
on
--
that's
available
only
when
you
go
to
trial.
we
are
not
saying
any
of
that
is
allowed.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
when
a
--
and
that
was
the
brady
trilogy,
brady
and
mcmann
and
ultimate
tollett,
which
led
to
hill.
what
the
court
recognized
is
when
you
plead
guilty
in
open
court
you
are
waiving
your
right
to
trial.
and
the
relevant
inquiry,
the
only
inquire
once
the
defendant
has
admitted
guilt,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
waiver
of
the
trial
rights
were
knowing
and
voluntary.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
a
relevant
inquiry
is
because
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
trial.
and
due
process
requires
that
the
waiver
of
those
trial
rights
be
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary.
and
in
hill,
the
court
confronted
the
question
and
said:
you
need
to
show
deficient
advice
in
the
context
of
pleading
guilty;
and
in
addition,
you
had
need
to
show
that
that
prejudiced
you
because,
absent
--
if
you
had
received
proper
advice,
you
would
have
actually
not
waived
your
right
to
trial;
you
would
have
asserted
your
right
to
trial
and
gone
to
trial.
that's
the
standard
that
applies.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
can,
and
because
what's
relevant--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right,
right.
the
key
is
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it's
a
different
prejudice.
the
--
when
you
plead
guilty
and
your
counsel
has
advised
you
wrongly
in
a
way
that
would
have
changed
your
mind
about
the
merits
of
going
forward
on
trial,
you
can
show
that
the
waiver
of
the
trial
right
is
something
that
was
prejudiced.
but
because
--
had
you
known,
had
you
been
properly
advised,
you
would
have
exercised
the
whole
panoply
of
rights
that
the
constitution
provides
one
who
goes
to
trial,
not
only
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
but
all
the
trial
rights
that
go
with
it.
but
when
you
instead
plead
guilty
in
open
court
--
and
the
claim
here
is
not
that
the
defendant
would
have
exercised
his
right
to
trial.
the
claim
is
he
would
have
waived
his
right
to
trial
either
way.
that
is
not
prejudice
to
the
--
that
would
overcome
the
guilty
plea,
which
again
rests
on--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
when
--
again,
once
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
prior
error,
once
you
plead
guilty,
the
question
is
not
whether
there
were
other
deals
on
the
table,
the
question
is
whether
that
waiver
of--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
right,
but
if
it
were
the
question,
it
would
call
into
--
this
court
in,
in
going
back
to
brady
and
then
in
boykin,
explained
that
what's
--
the
relevant
question
when
you
enter
a
guilty
plea
is
whether
you
have
waived
your
right
to
trial
validly.
and,
in
fact,
that
has
to
be
spread
upon
the
record.
rule
11(b)
has
now
been
modified
by
this
court
to
go
through
the
things
you
have
to
check
to
make
sure
that
that
waiver
of
your
trial
rights
are
knowing
and
voluntary.
what
we
have
here
is
not
anything
associated
with
the
waiver
of
trial
rights.
what
really
the
defendant
is
claiming
is
some
entitlement
be
able
to
take
another
deal
that
would
not
have
resulted
in
trial.
but
that
is
not
relevant
to
the
waiver
of
trial
rights.
that
would
be
recognizing
another
type
of
right.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
guilty
plea,
there
is
no
right
to
plea
bargaining,
once
you
have
a
plea
agreement
there
is
no
right
to
enforcement.
the
only
rights
that
come
into
play
is
when
that
guilty
plea
is
rendered
into
a
judgment.
and
when
you
don't
get
there,
but
instead
you
plead
guilty
and
you
have
waived
your
right
to
trial,
you
have
consented
to
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
even
if
you
had
received
better
advice
you
would
have
consented
to
the
--
you
would
not
have
gone
forward
to
trial,
you
have
--
the
basis
on
which
the
conviction
rests
remains
valid.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
precisely.
and
this
court
in
premo
addressed
the
exact
same
question.
in
premo
there
was
a
contention
that
had
counsel
done
better
before
by
filing
a
motion
to
suppress,
it
would
have
been
in
a
better
position
to
secure
a
better
plea
agreement
from
the
prosecution.
but
the
court
concluded
that,
no;
the
relevant
inquiry
once
you
have
pled
guilty
is
whether
or
not
you
would
have,
if
properly
advised,
insisted
on
your
trial
rights
and
gone
to
trial.
that's
the
standard
set
forth
in
hill.
and
the
reason--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--if
he
pleads
guilty?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
catch
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
if
he
has
pleaded
guilty
and
he
validly
waived
his
rights
to
trial,
because
he
would
not
have
asserted
them,
then
i
think
under
hill
what
you
have
is
a
defendant
who
admits
guilt,
there
is
no
real
risk
of
any
kind
of
error
in
that
determination,
and
the
judgment
which
must
be
set
aside
--
remember,
we
have
to
set
aside
the
judgment.
the
judgment
rests
on
the
admission
of
guilt
and
the
waiver
of
trial.
the
judgment
cannot
be
set
aside
at
that
point,
because
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
special
force
of
finality
with
respect
to
guilty
pleas.
that
is
because
for
several
reasons.
first,
guilty
pleas
are
an
important
part
of
the
system,
and
it
would
be
--
both
delay
and
impair
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
any
time
we
open
another
avenue
to
challenge
guilty
pleas.
but,
two,
once
the
defendant
has
stood
up
in
open
court
and
admitted
guilt,
there
is
almost
no
risk
of
error,
and
the
defendant
has
gotten
the
proper
sentence
and
the
proper
conviction.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you.
