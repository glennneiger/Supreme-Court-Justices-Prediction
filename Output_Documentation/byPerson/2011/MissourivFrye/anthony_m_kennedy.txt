justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
he
hadn't
heard
of
the
earlier
better
offer.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
regardless,
your
legal
position
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
setting
aside
the
plea
if
an
earlier,
better
offer
was
not
communicated.
that's
your
legal
position,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
there's
no
sixth
amendment
violation
when
the
counsel
fails
to
communicate
a
favorable
offer
to
the
defendant.
that's
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
we
took
the
case
for.
we
didn't
--
we
wouldn't
have
taken
the
case
if
we
were
concerned
about
what
happened
in
march
and
what
happened
in
february.
we
took
the
case
because
of
your
position,
which
is
it's
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation
in
these
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
--
it's
very
odd
for
you
to
say
that
--
to
me
--
that
this
is
not
a
critical
stage.
if
it
results
in
a
guilty
plea
and
the
--
and
the
attorney
has
not
done
sufficient
research
to
uncover
a
defense,
it
can
be
set
aside
then.
so
it's
--
so
you
are
saying
it's
not
a
critical
stage
depending
on
what
the
end
result
is.
that's
very
difficult.
i
thought
we
were
going
to
tell
attorneys,
you
have
an
obligation
during
this
plea
bargain
process
to
use
professional
competence.
and
you
say,
well,
you
do
or
you
don't.
that
doesn't
make
much
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
defense
counsel
gives
wrong
information
to
the
defendant
about
witnesses
that
can
testify
in
his
behalf,
and
so
forth,
very
bad
legal
advice,
that
can
be
grounds
for
setting
aside
the
plea,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
--
and
that
is
because
counsel
pre
the
entry
of
the
plea
did
not
adequately
advise
his
client.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
there
no
problem
when
he
doesn't
adequately
advise
a
client
of
earlier
better
offers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
--
suppose
the
case
in
which
a
plea
offer's
made,
not
communicated,
and
expires.
and
then
there
is
a
guilty
plea
here.
and
he
doesn't
--
and
the
defendant
enters
a
--
a
guilty
plea
but
doesn't
know
about
the
prior
offer.
is
--
is
there
injury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
the
plea
involuntary?
pardon
me,
is
it
unknowing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
would
he
--
what
would
he
have
done
had
he
known?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean,
judge,
i'm
really
sorry
i
didn't
accept
responsibility
three
months
earlier?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
today
the
court
issues
two
opinions
on
the
same
subject,
both
concern
clams
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
the
context
of
plea
bargaining
and
the
first
case
to
be
announced
is
missouri
versus
frye
and
the
second
is
lafler
versus
cooper.
in
the
first
case,
mr.
frye
was
arrested
for
driving
without
a
license.
an
offer
of
a
plea
bargain
was
mailed
to
his
counsel
and
in
it,
the
prosecutor
offered
to
recommend
a
90-day
sentence
if
frye
pled
guilty,
but
frye's
counsel
did
not
tell
him
about
the
offer
and
the
offer
expired.
frye
later
pled
guilty.
he
received
a
three-year
sentence.
it
was
his
fourth
conviction
for
driving
without
a
license.
in
post
conviction
proceedings
in
the
missouri
state
court,
frye
claimed
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
he
argued
he
would
have
accepted
the
prosecutor's
offer
of
a
plea
bargain
had
he
known
about
it.
the
state
trial
court
denied
the
post
conviction
motion,
but
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
reversed,
this
court
grant
of
certiorari.
it
is
well
established
that
criminal
defendants
have
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
critical
stages
of
the
prosecution.
among
these
critical
stages
is
the
consideration
of
a
plea
bargain
offered
by
the
state.
few
would
doubt
that
a
defense
attorney
has
a
responsibility
to
tell
his
client
about
a
prosecutor's
formal
offer
of
a
plea
bargain.
so,
there
seems
to
be
agreement
among
the
parties
to
this
case
that
counsel's
performance
was
deficient,
but
in
arguing
that
relief
should
be
denied,
the
state
points
out,
there
is
no
right
to
a
plea
bargain.
that's
true,
but
it
is
also
true
that
nearly
95%
of
convictions
result
from
a
plea
of
bargain
to
a
significant
degree
then
--
then.
today's
criminal
justice
system
is
a
system
of
plea
bargains
and
this
court
is
unwilling
to
say
that
within
that
system,
counsel's
performance
does
not
matter.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
respondent,
frye,
will
necessarily
obtain
relief
in
this
case.
once
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
shown,
the
defendant
must
still
show
prejudice.
the
standard
for
prejudice
is
set
out
in
strickland
versus
washington,
an
earlier
case
from
this
court.
under
the
strickland
test,
even
after
showing
ineffective
assistance,
the
defendant
must
show
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
result
of
the
proceeding
would
have
been
different
and
that
he
was
injured
as
a
result.
on
freeman
--
on
remand,
frye
would
have
the
opportunity
to
attempt
to
make
that
showing
and
that
task
will
not
be
an
easy
one.
that's
because
less
than
a
week
before
the
first
opportunity
for
the
trial
court
to
enter
any
plea
bargain,
in
other
words,
even
if
the
plea
bargain
had
been
communicated,
the
trial
judge
still
had
to
approve
it
and
a
week
before
that,
frye
was
arrested
for
once
again
driving
without
a
license.
in
light
of
that
new
offense,
there
is
reason
to
doubt
that
the
prosecution
would
have
adhered
to
the
agreement
or
that
the
trial
court
would
have
accepted
it
unless
the
state
law
somehow
required
performance
once
frye
accepted.
it's
appropriate
for
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
to
address
this
question
in
the
first
instance.
the
judgment
of
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito
join.
