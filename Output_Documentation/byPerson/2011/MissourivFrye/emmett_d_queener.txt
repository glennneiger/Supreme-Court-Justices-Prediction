mr.
emmett
d.
queener
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
galin
frye
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
felony
driving
while
revoked
and
was
sentenced
to
3
years
in
prison.
his
trial
lawyer
failed
to
inform
him
that
the
prosecutor
was
willing
to
allow
him
to
accept
a
plea
offer
to
a
misdemeanor
charge
and
recommend
90
days
in
jail.
fundamental
fairness
and
reliability
of
criminal
process
requires
that
an
attorney
provide
his
client
information
regarding
matters
in
this
case.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
fairness
includes
a
whole
range
of
sentencing
options,
and
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
was
making
a
determination
of
what
was
fair
in
this
case
when
he
made
the
offer.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
part
of
the
consideration
that
a
defendant
has
to
make
during
the
plea
bargaining
process
or
plea
negotiation
process
is
determining
the
liability
that
he's
willing
to
accept
in
entering
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
well,
he
was
--
the
guilty
plea
in
terms
of
what
he
was
admitting
to,
he
was
willing
to
and
had
to
agree
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
of
driving
while
--
while
revoked.
but
the
plea
was
open
in
terms
of
sentencing
and
he
was
allowed
to
argue
for
something
lower
than
sentencing.
he
only
knew
that
was
the
available
options
at
that
time.
he
wasn't
aware
that
the
prosecutor
had
made
available
an
option
to
him
to
limit
his
exposure
for
that
offense
to
90
days.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
okay.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
the
plea
was
unknowing
and
involuntary
because
he
was
not
made
aware
by
his
counsel's
unprofessional
representation
of
all
of
the
circumstances
available
to
him,
the
consequences
of
entering
that
guilty
plea,
that
would
have
included
the
90-day
on
a
misdemeanor
if
he
had
been
aware
of
that.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
this
offer
was
only
no
longer
on
the
table
at
the
time
he
entered
the
plea
of
guilty,
because
it
had
expired.
and
that
was
a
result
of
counsel's
ineffectiveness
in
failing
to
communicate
that
to
him.
the
lower
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
made
a
finding
that
this
offer
was
available,
and
he
could
have
taken
advantage
of
it
before
it
expired.
and
that
was
a
finding
by
the
court
below.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
--
that's
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
involuntary
in
the
sense
that
he
didn't
know
it
then.
it's
not
that
it's
involuntary
now
because
that
he
knows
it.
it
was
involuntary
because
he
didn't
know
it
then.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
there
is
--
there
is
an
increase
in
sentence.
and
that's
the
situation
here.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
it
is--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--it's
unknowing
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
know
the--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--what
he
does
--
what's
unknowing
about
that
is
the
potential
consequence
that
he
is
choosing
in
deciding
to
plead
guilty.
and
if
i
may,
that's
the
second
part
of
your
question.
the
right
that
he
has
is
the
right
to
make
fundamental
decisions
--
in
his
case,
one
of
which
is
to
accept
a
plea
bargain
and
plead
guilty.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
that
can
be
with
--
excuse
me
--
that
can
be
withdrawn
at
any
time
by
the
prosecutor,
but
we're
not
arguing
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
particular
plea
--
a
particular
plea.
he
is
entitled
to
the
right
to
make
a
knowing
and
voluntary
acceptance
of
a
plea,
a
knowing
and
voluntary
guilty
plea,
and
that
requires
that
he
know
all
of
the
information.
and
the
record
that
we
have
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
plea
would
not
have
gone
forward.
the
mere
potentiality
for
withdrawing
the
plea--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--the
right
is
to
enter
that
plea
knowing
the
full
consequences
of
what
he's
doing
at
that
point,
which
includes
the
limitation
on
his
exposure
for
the
offense.
this
is
sort
of
a
sentencing
issue.
and
an
increase
in
sentence
is
a
--
is
prejudicial.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
their
finding
more
specifically
i
think
was
that
they
did
not
feel
like
they
were
empowered
to
do
so.
we
certainly
believe
that
they
can
--
they
are
empowered
to
do
so
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
remedy
provided
for
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
agree
with
you
completely,
your
honor.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
that
--
that
is
the
issue
where
--
in
terms
of
the
sentencing
outcome,
this
is
knowledge
that
he
is
required
to
--
that
is
required
by
his
attorney
to
provide
him
--
sentencing
of
difference
is
prejudicial
under
strickland,
and
the
remedy
for
--
i
guess
going
back
in
--
even
more
basic
than
that
--
is
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
--
has
to
be
remedied.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i'm
going
to
have
to
couch
that
in
terms
of
saying
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
--
what
you
have
to--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--that
would
probably
not
be
ineffective
assistance.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
the
question
would
then
be
whether
or
not
there
is
prejudice
from
that.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
think
an
attorney
can
provide
reasonable
representation
in
making
that
sort
of
an
offer.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
in
that
circumstance,
it
is
ineffective
assistance,
because
he
has
to
do
what
is
--
is
a
reasonable
standard
of
representation.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
under
that
circumstance,
that
would
--
may
well
be.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
as
i
understand
these
cases,
the
--
the
standards
being
applied
are
the
strickland
standard.
it's
the
high
bar
of
deficient
performance
and
prejudice
under
strickland.
and--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--i
mean,
that
--
that's
certainly
true.
i
mean,
we
--
we
have--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--right.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
qualify
my
answer
a
little
bit.
because
i
think
we're
--
what
the
court
has
to
--
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
rational
decision
requirement
that
i
think
was
reiterated
in
--
in
padilla.
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
making
a
rational
decision
--
in
that
choice.
it's
not
simply
that
there
was
many
another
offer
out
there,
but
was
the
decision
rational
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
accept
or
reject
that
offer
that
was
there?
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
that
may
well
be
the--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--that
may
well
be
the
easier
part
of
the
--
of
the
equation.
but
there's
still
going
to
be--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--that's
--
yes.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
--
i
think
reasonable
probability
is
a
--
is
a
workable
standard
that
we
have
used
for
--
for
many
years.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
the
--
this
is
a
remedy
for
the
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
that
is
to
put
the
defendant
back
into
the
position
as
nearly
as
possible
as
he
would
have
been
in
at
the
time;
and
at
the
time
the
offer
was
open
--
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
prosecutor
is
being
ordered
initially
or
the
first
instance
to
make
an
offer;
it
--
this
is
being
viewed
as
the
offer
that
was
originally
made
is
still
available
and
open
to
the
defendant.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
there
--
there
is
never
going
to
be
a
perfect
remedy
for
any
of
these
violations,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
right.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
well--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--there
can
be
a
perfect--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--i
think
this
is
close
to
perfect,
as
close
to
perfect
as
we
can
get,
which
is
what
is
required
for
sixth
amendment
remedies,
that
it
mitigated
to
the
extent
possible.
and
in
those
circumstances
where
one
party,
the
interests
of
one
party
may
be
infringed
upon,
if
that
happens
--
they
can't
be
infringed
upon
unnecessarily.
this
is
a
necessary
infringement.
the
state
bears
the
burden
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
if
that's
in
a
--
an
erroneous
sentencing
then
the
state
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
erroneous
sentencing.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
yes.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
no
it
was--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--well
those
were
foreclosed
simply
as
a
result
of
trial
counsel's
ineffectiveness,
which
--
which
caused
him
to
be
unaware
that
they
had
been
ever
available
to
him.
so
that
that's
how
the
plea
becomes
involuntary
is
not
that
he's
not
aware
of
what
the
situation
is
at
the
time
that
he's
entering
the
plea,
because
there
are
many
other
circumstances
that
goes
into
his
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
enter
a
plea.
those
alternatives
were
only
no
longer
available
to
him
as
a
result
of
counsel's
failure
to
perform
his
duty
professionally
and
communicate
the
offer.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
state
court
of
--
court
of
appeals
simply
thought
it
was
not
empowered
to
put
him
back
in
the
position
that
he
was
in,
and
i
think
that
is
the
remedy
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
the
second
point
in
the
--
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
yes,
yes.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
but
we
did
file
the
petition
challenging
the
--
the
finding
of
the
--
or
the
relief
provided
by
the
court
below.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
no,
but
the
last
i
--
the
last
i
recall
that
cert
petition
was
still
pending,
i
may
be
wrong
about
that,
i'm
not
sure,
that
it
was
just
into
this
case.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
think
both
of
those
are
futile
remedies,
and
--
and
that's
why
it's
really
obvious
that
the
remedy
has
to
be
something
else.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
he
does
have
a
very
like
--
a
very
good
likelihood
of
succeeding
at
trial.
that's
not
going
to
do
any
good.
that
won't
get
him
a
misdemeanor
where
he
will
be
sentenced
to
90
days.
the
open
plea
is
basically
the
same
--
the
very
same
think
that's
causing
him
the
prejudice
in
this
case,
so
the
remedy
being
provided
by
missouri
court
of
appeals
is
essentially
no
remedy
at
all
for
the
prejudice
that
he
suffered.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
yes.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
entirely
the
only
answer
we
can
draw
from
this
record.
at
the
time
that
this
--
or
this
guilty
plea
was
being
entered
and
the
sentence
was
handed
down,
this
was
an
open
plea,
it
was
not
an
agreement.
if
they
had
gone
to
court
on
a
plea
agreement
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense,
and
that
was
up
for
a
--
an
amendment
down
to
a
misdemeanor
and
a
reduced
charge;
you
know,
that
is
something
more
definitive.
then
the
judge
would
be
looking
at
what
the
parties
had
agreed
to
at
that
point.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
the
open
plea
basically
means
there
is
not
an
agreement
between
the
parties.
now
they
may
each
know
what
either
party
is
going
to
argue
for
or
recommend,
but
there
is
not
an
agreement
between
the
parties.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
and
i
think
that
--
would
leave
the
court
with
a
little
more
flexibility
than
--
than
he
might
otherwise
exercise
if
they
came
to
him
with
an
agreement.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
yes.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
think
the
deference
to
the
trial
court
on
probation
was
in
that
first
one,
the
three
years
with
defer
to
the
court
on
probation.
if
they
had
agreed
on
the
90
days
in
the
misdemeanor,
that
would
have
been
a
plea
agreement
between
the
two
parties.
that
would
have
been
a
definitive--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--not
binding
the
judge.
no,
that
would
not
bind
the
judge.
it
never
would.
the
judge
would
have
the
opportunity,
at
that
point
--
the
only
time
--
the
only
thing
the
judge
would
have
discretion
over
at
that
point
would
be
the
actual
amount
of
sentence.
if
the
prosecutor
reduced
that
from
a
felony
to
a
misdemeanor,
the
judge
couldn't
reject
that.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
he
would
have
had
to
accept--
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
--he
would
not
have
had
to
accept
the
90
days.
mr.
emmett
d.
queener
i
don't
have
proof
in
the
record
that
he
would
have.
what
i
have
in
the
record
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
that
would
not
have
happened.
the
appellate
court
found
--
in
fact
by
making
the
determination
that
mr.
frye
was
prejudiced,
necessarily
made
the
conclusion
that
that
plea
would
have
gone
forward.
the
motion
court
said
nothing
to
refute
that.
there
was
nothing
in
the
court's
findings
that
the
court
would
not
have
accepted
that
agreement
had
the
parties
come
before
it
with
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
