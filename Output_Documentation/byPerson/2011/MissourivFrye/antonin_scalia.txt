justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
position.
there
--
there
is
a
statement
in
your
brief
that
the
question
is
whether
plea
negotiations
that
did
not
result
in
a
guilty
plea
constitute
a
critical
confrontation
that
gives
the
rise
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
during
such
negotiations.
so
i
thought
your
position
was
that
so
long
as
the
--
the
plea
negotiations
don't
result
in
a
guilty
plea,
effective
assistance
of
counsel
doesn't
even
come
into
the
equation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
say
yes
or
no.
i
mean,
you
can
retract
the
question
on
that,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
they
do
not
result
in
a
guilty
plea.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
we
don't
care
about
that.
what
do
we
care
about
that?
we
--
we
don't
take
cases
to
figure
out
those
--
those
picky,
picky
factual
questions.
the
issue
that
i
thought
was
important
here
is
whether
this
is
a
critical
stage
when
--
when
the
defendant
is
not
--
does
not
accept
the
--
the
plea
and
plead
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
were
a
critical
stage,
i
suppose
that
counsel
would
be
ineffective,
not
only
if
he
was
a
lousy
lawyer
and
didn't
know
the
law,
but
if
he
was
a
bad
negotiator.
i
mean
--
right?
being
a
good
criminal
lawyer
means
you
--
you
got
to
be
a
good
horse
trader,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
tell
him
to
turn
down
a
deal
that
in
fact,
you
know,
was
a
pretty
good
deal,
that
would
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
so
you
must
--
you
must
know
how
to
handle
yourself
in
a
used
car
lot,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
the
--
the
guilty
--
i
mean,
no,
the
reason
why
that
is
not
true
is
that
the
guilty
plea
must
be
entered
with
advice
of
counsel.
you
acknowledge
that,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
guilty
plea
doesn't
erase
everything
if
it
has
been
entered
without
advice
of
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
admitted
that
you
got
what
you
deserved,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
is
it
unfair
for
the
law
to
apply
to
this
individual
the
punishment
he
deserved
for
the
crime
that
he
committed?
i
mean,
the
object
of
the
system
is
to
put
--
is
to
punish
people
who
commit
crimes
in
a
certain
degree.
and
here
he
admitted
he
did
the
crime
and
he
got
the
degree
of
punishment
that
the
law
provides.
what
could
be
more
fair
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
ex
ante,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that.
but
when
you
look
at
it
later,
it's
clear
that
that
would
have
been
unfair.
in
fact,
this
individual
was
perfectly
willing
to
admit
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
more
than
what
the
prosecutor
had
offered.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
and
he
did
that
when
he
entered
the
plea
of
guilty.
you
do
not
contest
he
was
well
advised
when
he
entered
that
plea
that
it
was
knowledgeable
and
he
admitted
that
that's
what
he
had
done
and
was
willing
to
accept
the
degree
of
punishment
prescribed
by
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
rule
that
the
plea
offer
may
be
withdrawn
at
any
time
by
the
prosecutor
--
indeed
even
after
it
has
been
accepted
--
doesn't
that
well
enough
establish
that
there
is
no
right
to
profit
from
that
plea
offer,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
he's
being
deprived
of,
given
that
the
prosecutor
can
withdraw
it
even
after
he
accepts
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
had
hoped
you
were
making
some
argument
other
than
the
knowing
argument,
because
as
prior
discussion
has
shown,
even
if
he
had
known,
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
whether
he
had
accepted
the
later
plea.
suppose
he
had
been
told,
"by
the
way,
there
was
an
earlier
plea.
"
"it's
too
late
to
accept
it
now.
"
"do
you
want
to
take
this
plea?
"
he
says,
"oh,
i'd
like
the
earlier
plea.
"
"i'm
sorry,
the
earlier
plea
is
gone.
"
"do
you
want
this
plea
or
not.
"
he
would
have
taken
it.
what
does
the
knowledge
of
the
earlier
lapsed
plea
have
to
do
with
whether
his
guilty
plea
is
knowing
and
voluntary?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
so
i
--
i
thought
you
had
some
other
argument
that
was
somehow
a
right
to
profit
from
the
earlier
offer.
and
i
find
it
hard
to
see
that
right,
given
that
the
prosecutor
can
withdraw
the
offer
and
indeed
even
withdraw
it
after
it's
accepted.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
surely
it's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
advise
him
to
turn
down
an
offer
that
he
should
have
snapped
up.
isn't
that
ineffective
assistance
as
well?
if
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
a
great
deal,
and
the
lawyer
said,
"nah,
you
shouldn't
take
it.
"
is
that
ineffective
assistance
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gave
you
the
circumstances.
it's
clearly
a
super
deal.
any
good
lawyer
would
have
told
him
to
take
it.
and
this
lawyer
says
"don't
take
it".
is
that
ineffective
assistance?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
ineffective
assistance
and
the
question
would
be
prejudiced.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
--
give
me
a
yes
or
no
to
the
question
whether,
if
every
reasonable
lawyer
would
have
told
him
to
snap
up
this
offer
but
his
counsel
tells
him,
no,
turn
it
down.
yes
or
no,
is
that
ineffective
assistance?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
we
are
in
the
soup.
because
every
one
of
these
pleas
is
subject
to
the
contention
that
oh,
there
was
an
earlier
plea,
or
i
should
have
--
i
should
have
taken
it
but
--
i
mean
--
and
i
suppose
that
if
he
goes
to
trial,
then
you
--
you
would
also
say
that
trial
should
not
have
occurred
because
it
was
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
caused
him
to
turn
down
the
plea.
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
--
right,
retry,
set
aside
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
at
the
time
that
offer
could
have
been
withdrawn
by
the
prosecutor.
and
you
are
saying
now
it
can't
be
withdrawn.
so
you
are
really
not
putting
him
back
in
the
situation
he
was
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
causes
us
to
be
suspicious
of
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
violation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
there
really
isn't
any
perfect
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
some
cases
not
even
a
close
to
perfect
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
difference
between
an
open
plea
and
a
plea
agreement.
he
just
comes
to
the
judge
and
says
i'm
willing
to
plead
to
this
without
the
prosecution
having
offered
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
still--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
--
but
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
as
you
heard,
i
filed
a
dissent
in
each
of
these
cases.
in
missouri
versus
frye,
the
chief
justice
and
justices
thomas
and
alito
have
joined
my
dissent.
in
lafler,
justice
thomas
has
joined
in
full
and
the
chief
justice
has
joined
al'l
but
one
part.
i
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
figure
out
which
of
my
following
comments
have
been
joined
by
whom,
lest
i
put
words
in
other
people's
mouths,
you
can
assume
i
speak
only
for
myself
and
justice
thomas.
let
me
begin
with
our
prior
case
law
to
which
the
majority
opinions
today
claimed
to
be
faithful.
for
nearly
three
decades,
ever
since
we
decided
the
seminal
case
of
strickland
versus
washington
dealing
within
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
we
have
explained
that
the
ultimate
focus,
â€œthe
ultimate
focus"
in
any
ineffective
assistance
case
must
be
"the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceeding
whose
result
is
being
challenged".
the
test
was
not
whether
the
result
would
have
been
different
but
for
the
ineffective
assistance,
but
whether
the
in
effective
assistance
destroyed
the
fairness
of
the
conviction.
thus
in
a
case
called
lockhart
versus
fretwell,
decided
in
1993,
counsel
had
failed
to
make
an
objection
which
under
the
then
current
law
pronounced
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
compelled
the
trial
court
to
give
the
defendant
a
life
sentence
instead
of
the
death
sentence
that
he,
in
fact,
received.
we
nonetheless
found
no
ineffective
assistance
in
the
constitutional
sense
because
that
case
from
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
had
later
been
reversed
by
this
court.
so,
even
though
counsel's
error
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
life
sentence,
that's
what
he
would
have
gotten.
it
did
not
deprive
him
of
a
fair
trial.
today's
opinion
changes
that.
there
is
not
doubt
that
the
defendants
in
these
cases
were
convicted
and
sentenced
pursuant
to
fair
and
constitutionally
valid
procedures.
one
of
them
got
the
gold
standard
of
american
justice,
a
full-dress
jury
trial
before
12
men
and
women
tried
and
true,
who
unanimously
found
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
other
defendant
confessed
his
guilt
after
a
judicial
proceeding
that
assured
his
confession
was
voluntary
and
true.
they
are
both
without
a
doubt
guilty,
they
do
not
claim
otherwise,
and
have
been
a
judge
so
and
sentenced
by
the
fairest
of
procedures.
what
they
claim
in
this
appeal
is
that
they
should
not
have
had
to
suffer
fair
conviction
and
sentence
because
it
was
only
mistake
of
counsel
that
deprived
them
of
a
better
plea
deal,
a
few
words
about
plea
bargaining.
in
many,
perhaps
most
countries
of
the
world,
american
style
plea
bargaining,
at
least
in
cases
such
as
serious
as
these,
is
forbidden,
even
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
testimony
that
enables
conviction
of
a
greater
malefactor,
much
less
simply
to
save
the
state
the
expense
of
trial.
in
europe,
many
countries
adhere
to
what
they
call
the
"legality
principle"
which
requires
prosecutors
to
charge
all
offenses
they
believe
they
can
prove.
in
the
united
states,
of
course,
we
have
plea
bargaining
a
plenty,
but
until
today,
we
have
regarded
it
as
a
necessary
evil.
sure,
it
causes
some
people
to
plead
guilty
to
offenses
they
are
really
not
guilty
of
simply
to
avoid
the
enormous
expense
and
the
risk
of
being
tried
for
higher
offenses
and
sure,
it
causes
a
lot
of
guilty
defendants,
perhaps
most
of
them,
to
get
off
with
a
less
punishment
than
the
law
says
they
deserve.
even
so,
we
accept
it
because
many
believe
that
without
plea
bargaining,
our
long
and
expensive
process
of
criminal
trial
could
not
sustain
the
burden
imposed
on
it
and
our
system
of
criminal
justice
would
grind
to
a
halt.
but
until
today,
no
one
has
thought
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
plea
bargain,
a
constitutional
right
not
to
plead
guilty
on
the
basis
of
bad
advice,
yes,
because
pleading
guilty
deprives
a
defendant
of
a
fair
trial
but
not
a
constitutional
right
to
plea
bargain.
in
all
states
and
the
federal
government,
the
prosecution
does
not
have
to
offer
a
plea
bargain.
the
prosecution
can
withdraw
it
until
it
is
accepted
and
even
after
it
has
been
accepted,
the
judge
can
refuse
to
approve
it.
in
some
states,
including
missouri,
the
state
involved
in
frye,
the
plea
offer
can
be
withdrawn
by
the
prosecution
even
after
the
defendant
has
accepted
it,
right
up
until
the
time
that
the
judge
approves
it
and
accepts
the
defendant's
guilty
plea.
after
today,
however,
plea
bargaining
is
no
longer
a
somewhat
embarrassing
adjunct
to
our
criminal
justice
system.
the
court
says,
quoting
approvingly
from
a
law
review
article,
"it
is
the
criminal
justice
system."
and
since
it
is,
defendants
are
entitled,
constitutionally
entitled
to
have
counsels
who
are
effective
plea
bargainers,
not
in
order
to
assure
that
the
defendants
get
a
fair
trial
but
in
order
to
assure
that
they
have
a
fair
chance
to
escape
a
fair
trial
and
get
less
punishment
than
they
deserve.
the
court
today
embraces
the
sporting
chance
theory
of
criminal
law
in
which
the
state
functions
like
a
conscientious
casino
operator,
giving
each
player
a
fair
chance
to
beat
the
house,
that
is,
to
serve
less
time
than
the
law
says
he
deserves
and
when
a
player
is
excluded
from
the
tables,
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
today's
opinions
open
a
whole
new
field
of
constitutionalized
criminal
procedure,
the
field
of
plea
bargaining
law.
the
court
announces
this
new
field
in
opinions
that
almost
seem
designed
to
sow
confusion.
today's
decision
--
decisions
deal
with
only
a
few
aspects
of
constitutional
plea
bargaining
law,
attorney'
failure
to
pass
along
a
plea
offer
and
attorney
failure
to
counsel
acceptance
of
a
plea
offer
because
of
mistake
regarding
what
their
prosecution
would
have
to
prove
at
trial.
what
other
counsel
bargaining
inadequacies
might
there
be?
the
court
does
not
say,
though
it
acknowledges
that
that
is
a
difficult
question
and,
of
course,
if
plea
bargaining
is
the
criminal
justice
system,
the
prosecution
must
have
some
responsibilities
as
well.
must
it
leave
a
plea
offer
open
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
so
that
the
defendant
can
ponder
it?
is
the
rule
that
a
plea
offer
can
be
withdrawn
at
anytime
before
the
court
accepts
the
plea
even
after
the
defendant
has
accepted
it?
is
that
rule
now
unconstitutional?
the
court
leaves
all
this
to
be
worked
out
in
further
litigation,
which
you
can
be
sure
there
will
be
plenty
of.
perhaps
the
most
perplexing
aspect
of
today's
opinions
is
the
majority's
discussion
of
the
appropriate
remedy
for
violations
of
its
newly
discovered
constitutional
right.
in
lafler,
the
court
requires
the
state
to
reoffer
the
plea
agreement
that
was
rejected
because
of
counsel's
bad
advice.
that
just
turns
out
to
be
meaningless
however
because
according
to
the
court,
"the
state
trial
court
can
then
exercise
its
discretion
in
determining
whether
to
vacate
the
convictions
and
resentence
respondent
pursuant
to
the
plea
agreement,
to
vacate
only
some
of
the
convictions
and
resentence
respondent
accordingly
or
to
leave
the
convictions
and
sentence
from
trial
undisturbed."
that
is
nothing
short
of
extraordinary.
nowhere
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
have
we
ever
suggested
that
the
remedy
for
an
unconstitutional
conviction,
which
this
is
said
to
be,
could
be
entirely
subject
to
the
trial
court's
discretion
or
that
the
remedy
could
ever
be
no
remedy
at
all.
there
are
other
things
wrong
with
these
opinions.
in
the
frye
case,
whether
the
defendant
suffered
any
prejudice
from
his
attorney's
failure
to
inform
him
of
the
plea
offer
depends
on,
one,
whether
he
would
have
accepted
the
plea
offer,
two,
whether
the
prosecution
would
have
withdrawn
it,
as
--
as
the
missouri
law
allows
and
three,
whether
the
trial
judge
would
have
approved
it.
all
of
these
woulders
are
purely
speculative.
on
remand,
the
court
is
to
determine
prejudice
by
a
process
of
retrospective
crystal
ball
gazing
posing
as
legal
analysis.
as
for
the
lafler
case,
that
is
here
on
federal
habeas
corpus
and
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
says
we
cannot
reverse
a
state
court
decision
on
federal
habeas
unless
it
violated
clearly
established
federal
law.
no
one
could
possibly
think
that
a
constitutional
right
to
plea
bargain
was
clearly
established
federal
law.
perhaps,
the
plea
bargaining
process
is
a
subject
worthy
of
regulation,
but
it
happens
not
to
be
a
process
regulated
by
the
constitution,
which
is
not
a
judicial
cure-all
for
all
of
society's
problems.
the
sixth
amendment
is
concerned
not
with
the
fairness
of
bargaining,
but
with
the
fairness
of
conviction.
in
today's
cases,
the
court's
zeal
to
bring
perfection
to
everything
requires
a
reversal
of
perfectly
valid,
eminently
just
convictions.
it
is
not
wise,
it
is
not
right.
