mr.
chris
koster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
but
for
counsel's
error,
defendant
would
have
insisted
on
going
to
trial.
that
is
the
test
for
prejudice.
but
in
mr.
frye's
case,
that
test
was
not
met.
the
truth
is,
despite
counsel's
error,
mr.
frye
knowingly
waived
his
right
to
trial,
and
solemnly
admitted
his
guilt.
under
both
hill
and
premo,
mr.
frye
has
failed
to
show
prejudice,
and
therefore
his
guilty
plea
remains
voluntary,
intelligent,
and
final.
mr.
frye
may
not
assert
ineffective
assistance
by
alleging
that,
but
for
counsel's
error,
he
could
have
gotten
a
better
deal
on
an
earlier
date.
that
is
not
the
standard.
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
chris
koster
well,
the
plea
--
the
plea
occurred
on
march
3,
2008--
mr.
chris
koster
--it
went
--
right.
the
plea
offer--
mr.
chris
koster
--the
plea
offer
expired
on
december
28,
2007,
i
believe.
mr.
chris
koster
that
actually
was
the
fifth
offense,
but
yes.
mr.
chris
koster
it
would
be
less
than
likely,
but
not
impossible,
i
would
say.
and
it
would
depend
on
a
myriad
of
circumstances,
many
of
which
are
as
--
as
--
could
be
just
dependent
on
the
defense
counsel's
own
personal
schedule.
but
the
scheduling
of
a
plea
once
--
once
an
agreement
has
been
made
between
a
prosecutor
and
a
defense
counsel,
the
scheduling
of
a
plea
i
think
is
largely
a
basis
of
convenience
and
does
not
necessarily
--
is
not
necessarily
based
on
the
preliminary
hearing
date
or
any
future
schedule
date.
mr.
chris
koster
it
could
be.
i
would
say
that
that
is--
mr.
chris
koster
--that
is
possible.
right.
but
it's
also
exactly
another
reason
to
keep
the
discretion
of
offering
these
plea
bargains,
and
the
ability
to
take
these
plea
bargains
back
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecutors
in
the
country.
mr.
chris
koster
the
last
part
of
the
question
is?
mr.
chris
koster
as
a
former
--
as
a
former
prosecutor
myself,
i
would
agree
with
this.
this
gentleman
went
into
court.
he
had
two
options
before
him.
there
was
not
a
third
option.
the
--
the
plea
that
was
--
that
left
reality
on
december
28
was
not
there
on
march
3.
he
had
a
binary
choice
between
two
options
on
march
3.
he
chose
not
trial.
by
choosing
not
trial,
it
leaves
us
without
a
situation
where
either
hill
or
premo
prejudice
can
be
shown.
mr.
chris
koster
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
unaware
of
the
earlier
better
offer.
that
is
correct.
but
in
this
case
also,
the
defendant
went
out
2
days
later
and
picked
up
a
fifth
charge.
so
one
of
the
considerations
that
i
think
has
to
be
left
with
the
court
is
that
the
possibility
that
this
particular
defendant
was
ever
going
to
see
this
plea
offer
is
almost
nil.
this
was
his
fifth
arrest
for
driving
while
revoked.
mr.
chris
koster
that
--
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
he
would
have
taken
the
90-day
deal
on
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
chris
koster
but
there
is
also
an
important
element
in
the
record,
that
when
he
went
in
front
of
the
court
on
march
3
and
the
felony
offer
was
given
to
the
judge,
which
was
3
years
in
deferral
on
probation
plus
10
days
shock
time,
the
judge
in
columbia,
missouri,
gave
the
felony
offer
the
back
of
his
hand.
and
so
while,
yes,
the
record
says
that--
mr.
chris
koster
--if
the
judge--
mr.
chris
koster
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chris
koster
well,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
brings
us
here
today.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
said
that--
mr.
chris
koster
--through
a
misrepresent
--
a
misinterpretation,
we
believe,
of
the
strickland
standard
and,
more
importantly,
a
misreading
of
where
hill
and
premo
takes
us.
cert.
was
granted
on
this
case
just
at
the
same
time
that
premo
was
very
clearly
re-articulating
the
hill
standard.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
had
gone
back
towards
strickland
with
a
very
broad
reading
just
as
this
court
was
coming
down
with
an
opinion
that
very
clearly
re-articulated
the
hill
standard,
the
two-part
performance
and
prejudice
test.
and
that's
what
we
are
asking
be
reversed.
mr.
chris
koster
the
court
probably
would
have
known
as
a
result
of
a
pre-sentence
investigation.
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
your
honor,
the
prosecutor
himself
would
have
known
about
the
--
the
second
arrest,
and
he
would
have
withdrawn
it.
and
if
i
may,
it's
not
always
--
we
have
concentrated
so
far
in
the
case
before
and
today
on
subsequent
criminal
actions.
you
know,
back
home
in
missouri,
the
criminal
reporting
system,
we
still
use
on
five-part
carbon
paper
that
you
have
got
to
press
hard
with
a
pen
to
get
down
to
the
fifth
page.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
prosecutor
learns
at
a
subsequent
date
of
a
criminal
history
that
is
material
that
predates
the
plea
offer.
and
so
in
both
directions,
it's
important
that
prosecutors
have
full
discretion
to
take
these
pleas
back.
mr.
chris
koster
my
legal
position
is
that
a
finding
--
a
conviction
was
entered
on
march
3.
he
pled
guilty.
the
question
before
the
court
is
what
satisfies
a
standard
by
which
we
are
going
to
unwind
it?
a
sixth
amendment
violation
would
satisfy
that
standard,
and
if
--
if
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
if
the
plea
was
truly
involuntary,
we
would
unwind
it.
but
the
search
for
a
better
deal
that
is
antecedent
to
the
events
of
march
3
is
not
the
sixth
amendment
violation
that
should
begin
unwinding
97
percent
of
the
convictions
in
the
country.
mr.
chris
koster
no.
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
ineffective
assistance
is
a
two-part
test,
that
there
was
a
performance
breach
in
the
failure
to
communicate,
but
once
the
performance
breach
is
accepted,
then
it
has
to
be
run
through
the
hill
standard
to
find
whether
prejudice
has
occurred,
and
then
we
would
find
the
sixth
amendment
breach.
but
we
--
we
do
not
get
there
logically
because
the
offer
did
not
exist
after
--
after
december
28.
mr.
chris
koster
i
--
there
is
a
question
in--
mr.
chris
koster
--is
the
question
whether
i
believe
that
plea
negotiations
are
a
critical
stage?
mr.
chris
koster
i
believe
they
are
not
--
i
believe
that
plea
negotiations
are
not
a
critical
stage
under
the
laws
of
this
court.
mr.
chris
koster
i
do
not
--
there
is
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
or
not
plea
negotiations
in
this
case
really
ever
engaged
when
all
that
ever
occurred
was
the
prosecutor
sent
a
letter
to
the
defense
attorney.
only
in
the
most
technical
of
readings--
mr.
chris
koster
--plea
negotiations
i
don't
believe
are
a
critical
stage,
because
the
fate
--
in
the
back
and
forth
between
a
prosecutor
and
a
defense
attorney
the
fate
of
the
accused
is
not
--
is
not
set.
and
these
--
of
course
these
negotiations
can
take
place
over
a
very
long
time.
either
party
can
get
up
from
the
table
and
walk
away
at
any
time.
and
then,
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
--
the
dialogue
of
the
negotiations
are
not
used
against
the
defendant
at
critical
stages,
which
would
contrast
it,
i
suppose,
in
a
miranda
situation
in
a
custodial
interrogation
where
that
would
be
a
critical
stage.
mr.
chris
koster
i
agree
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
extensions,
if
critical
stage
analysis
was
applied
to
plea
negotiations.
mr.
chris
koster
i
understand
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
ramifications.
mr.
chris
koster
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
attorneys
are
guaranteed
the
accused
at
critical
stages,
such
as
arraignments,
plea
hearings,
trials,
but
then
there
is
an
implied
guarantee
that
comes
with
that
critical
stage,
and
that
implied
guarantee
is
that
their
--
that
the
attorney
appointed
will
do
research,
analysis
and
preparation
that
prepares
him
for
the
critical
stage.
but
when
david
boyce
is
sitting
home
on
a
saturday
night
with
a
file
opened
in
his
lap
preparing
for
a
case
on
monday,
that
moment
is
not
a
critical
stage
of
trial,
on
a
saturday
night
in
his
den,
but
it
prepares
for,
it
is
precedent
to
a
critical
stage.
and
the
failure
to
engage
in
that
preparation
analysis
can
lead
to
performance
and
prejudice
at
critical
stages,
but
it
itself
is
not.
mr.
chris
koster
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
a
--
is
a
term
of
art,
and
it
is
a
two-part
test.
i
believe
that
there
can
be
performance
breaches
that
occur
between
--
at
the
--
at
the
plea
bargaining
stage,
but
that
prejudice
does
not
occur
until
we
return
to
a
critical
stage,
which
is
--
is
when
that
--
when
that
plea,
when
the
product
of
that
plea
negotiation
is
returned
to
a
critical
stage
and
then
it
has
critical
stage
protections
over
it,
where
the
judge
is
there
and
there
is
an
allocution
and
the
rest
of
the
protections--
mr.
chris
koster
--in
tollett
--
may
i?
mr.
chris
koster
in
tollett
v.
henderson
the
question
of
the
defendant
mr.
henderson's
knowing
waiver
in
that
case,
where
the
breach
was
infinitely
more
egregious
in
my
view,
which
was
the
1948
court
packing
that
occurred
and
the
african
americans
citizens
were
excluded
from
that
grand
jury
pool.
mr.
henderson's
lack
of
knowledge
about
a
previous
constitutional
deprivation
was
not
--
did
not
make
his
waiver
unknowing.
same
with
the
analysis
in
mcmann
and
in
parker
and
in
brady.
to
--
to
say
--
there
is
no
limiting
principle
that
will
allow
this
omission
to
unwind
the
knowing
quality
of
mr.
frye's
waiver
and
then
not
open
up
the
floodgates
to
all
sorts
of
pre-constitutional
deprivations.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
chris
koster
thank
you,
your
honor.
two
of
the
justices
questions
raise
the
concept
of
sentencing
equivalency.
and
certainly
sentencing
equivalency
is
an
important
goal,
both
at
the
federal
system
and
we've
tried
at
the
state
system.
but
sentencing
equivalency
is
not
an
avenue
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
intending
to
reach.
the
essential
question
here
to
justice
breyer's
earlier
question
that
i
think
i
didn't
answer
properly,
is
should
we
begin
unwinding
these
convictions
in
search
of
lost
plea
opportunities?
i
think
that
we
should
not.
it
undermines
the
long
discussions
in
both
hill
and
premo
about
the
importance
of
the
finality
of
these,
and
our
being
able
to
rely
on
the
finality
of
these
decisions.
there
is
mutual
reliance,
there's
state
reliance
as
well,
because
when
these
offers
are
made
the
state
does
not
interview
witnesses,
the
state
does
not
send
evidence
to
the
lab,
the
state
does
not,
you
know
--
sometimes
even
get
to
the
point
where
the
charges
are
made.
so
there
is
state
reliance,
which
is
synonymous
with
a
reliance
of
justice
on
the
finality
of
these
agreements
as
well.
and
also,
the
search
for
these
lost
opportunities
that
mr.
frye
is
asking
this
court
to
lead
us
towards,
takes
a
point
of
representation
beyond
the
limited
scope
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
gonzalez
v
--
gonzalez-lopez
and
other
courts,
the
limited
--
the
limitation
of
the
sixth
amendment
that
this
court
has
always
appropriately
articulated.
for
this
and
other
reasons
stated
in
our
briefing,
the
missouri
versus
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
