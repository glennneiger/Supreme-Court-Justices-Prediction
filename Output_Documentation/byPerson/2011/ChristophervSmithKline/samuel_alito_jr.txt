well,
is
that
consistent
with
the
government's
argument?
they
argue,
quote,
"an
employee
does
not
make
a
sale
for
purposes
of
the
outside
salesmen
exemption
unless
he
actually
transfers
title
to
the
property
at
issue.
"
the
statute
refers
to
a
consignment
for
sale.
when
that
occurs,
does
--
does
the
consignor
actually
transfer
title
to
the
property
at
issue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
i
would
appreciate
an
answer--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--to
my
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
the
government's
position
consistent
with
the
reference
to
consignment
for
sale?
when
a
consignment
for
sale
occurs,
is
there
a
transfer
of
title?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
a
--
a
transfer
of
title?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
no,
i
understand.
i
understand
your
position
to
be
different
from
theirs.
but
i--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--perhaps
i
should
ask
them
about
--
about
their
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no
--
but
anyway,
go
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
about
salesmen
who
--
whose
objective
is
to
obtain
a
rental?
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
they
qualify.
does
the
government
disagree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
those
employees
work
on
commissions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
promotional
workers
do
work
on
commissions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
they
say
that
that's
their
test?
where
does
the
department
of
labor
say
that's
their
test,
it
has
to
be
a
commitment.
i
thought
what
they
said
in
their
brief
was
there
has
to
be
a
transfer
of
title.

the
second
case
is
christopher
versus
smithkline
beecham
corporation,
number
11-204.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
flsa
requires
employers
to
pay
their
employees
time-and-half-wages
for
hours
worked
in
excess
of
40
per
week.
certain
categories
of
employees,
however,
are
exempt
from
that
requirement,
including
those
“employed
in
the
capacity
of
outside
salesman.”
the
nature
of
the
work
done
by
outside
salesman
would
make
it
very
difficult
if
not
entirely
impractical
to
keep
track
of
the
hours
they
work.
they
work
outside
the
office
most
of
the
time.
they're
often
on
the
road
and
their
pay
often
consists
at
least
in
part
of
commissions
based
on
the
number
of
sales
they
make.
the
statute
does
not
define
the
term
outside
salesman,
but
the
department
of
labor
has
issued
regulations
that
do
so
and
this
case
concerns
the
proper
interpretation
of
those
regulations.
respondent
is
a
pharmaceutical
company
that
manufactures
and
sells
prescription
drugs.
under
federal
law
prescription
drugs
may
not
be
dispensed
without
a
physician's
prescription.
consequently,
pharmaceutical
companies
have
long
employed
pharmaceutical
sales
representatives
to
provide
information
to
physicians
about
their
products
and
to
obtain
nonbinding
commitments
from
physicians
to
prescribe
those
products
in
appropriate
cases.
petitioners
were
employed
as
pharmaceutical
sales
representatives
for
roughly
four
years.
during
that
time
they
earned
an
average
annual
salary
of
more
than
$70,000
and
regularly
worked
more
than
40
hours
per
week.
they
brought
this
suit
alleging
that
their
employer's
failure
to
pay
them
overtime
wages
violated
the
flsa
and
they
sought
back
pay
and
liquidated
damages.
the
district
court
held
that
petitioners
were
not
entitled
to
overtime
wages
under
flsa
because
they
were
employed
in
the
capacity
of
outside
salesman
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
now
affirm
the
ninth
circuit.
according
to
the
department
of
labor
--
according
to
the
department
of
labor's
interpretation
of
its
regulations,
pharmaceutical
sales
representatives
do
not
qualify
as
outside
salesman
because
they
do
not
actually
transfer
title
to
any
goods.
although,
we
ordinarily
defer
to
an
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulations
under
our
decision
in
auer
versus
robbins,
there
are
strong
reasons
for
not
doing
so
in
this
case.
petitioners
invoked
the
department's
interpretation
to
impose
potentially
massive
liability
upon
respondent
for
conduct
that
occurred
well
before
the
department's
interpretation
was
announced.
until
the
department
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
similar
case
in
2009,
for
many
years,
it
had
never
indicated
that
it
thought
the
pharmaceutical
industry's
long
standing
practice
of
treating
sales
representatives
as
outside
--
as
exempt
employees
violated
the
fsla.
to
defer
in
this
circumstance
would
undermine
the
principle
that
agencies
should
provide
regulated
parties
with
fair
warning
of
the
conduct
the
regulation
prohibits
or
requires.
the
department's
interpretation
is
also
unpersuasive
in
its
own
right.
the
principle
regulation
at
issue
in
this
case
provides
that
an
outside
salesman
is
an
employee
whose
primary
duty
is
making
sales
and
it
incorporates
by
reference
to
statutory
definition
of
a
sale.
that
definition
provides
that
a
sale
includes
any
sale,
exchange,
contract
to
sell,
consignment
for
sale,
shipment
for
sale
or
other
disposition.
the
department's
interpretation
that
a
sale
requires
a
transfer
of
title
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
this
definition
since
a
consignment
for
sale,
one
of
the
transactions
specifically
included
in
the
definition
of
sale
does
not
involve
a
transfer
of
title.
applying
traditional
rules
of
interpretation
we
conclude
that
the
catchall
phrase
“other
disposition”
in
the
statutory
definition
of
sale
is
most
reasonably
interpreted
as
including
those
arrangements
that
are
tantamount
in
a
particular
industry
to
a
paradigmatic
sale
of
a
commodity.
obtaining
a
nonbinding
commitment
from
a
physician
to
prescribe
a
certain
product
is
tantamount
to
a
sale
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
and
so,
petitioners
were
employed
in
the
capacity
of
outside
salesman.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
and
kagan
have
joined.
