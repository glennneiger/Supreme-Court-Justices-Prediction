justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
--
i
don't
agree
that
there's
an
agreement
for
transfer
of
title.
where
there's
a
consignment,
you
give
the
property
to
somebody,
and
he
says
i
will
sell
it
to
somebody
if
somebody
will
buy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
agreement
to
transfer
title.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
purely
a
future
contingency.
if
someone
will
buy
it,
i
will
sell
them
--
sell
it
to
that
person
on
your
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
what
that
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
an
emergency
service
worker?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
they're
not
on
duty
all
the
time.
aren't
--
don't
they
have
hours
of
duty?
my
goodness.
some
of
them
make
enormous
overtime
wages
because
they've
put
in
hours
beyond
their
regular
hours
of
duty--
justice
antonin
scalia
--these
people
have
no
hours
of
duty.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
can
draw
--
draw
even
silly
lines.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
congress
draws
it,
it's
a
line.
but
the
line
you're
suggesting
here
--
both
your
brief
and
the
government's,
as
i
recall,
say,
my
goodness,
if
we
find
for
the
respondent
here,
there'll
be
so
much
uncertainty
in
the
future.
i'm
not
sure
there
isn't
a
lot
of
uncertainty
if
we
--
if
we
find
in
your
direction.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
one
of
my
law
clerks
--
my
law
clerks
supplement
my
sparse
life
experience.
[laughter]
one
of
my
law
clerks
is
familiar
with
the
--
the
framing
business.
okay?
now,
salesmen
of
frames
do
not
sell
the
frames
at
the
time
that
they
visit
the
--
the
framing
company
or
the
framing
store.
they
get
a
commitment
that
in
the
future,
that
person
will
order
from
the
framing
company.
now,
is
that
a
sale?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
there
is
a
commitment.
there
is
a
commitment
to
--
what
they
are
trying
to
get
is
a
commitment
to
consider
this
drug
if
it's
appropriate
for
prescription
to
patients
in
the
future.
that's
a
commitment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
peculiar
line
of
commerce.
and
--
and
you
are
saying
that
what
constitutes
a
sale
of
a
salesman
cannot
take
account
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
weird
line
of
commerce,
where
you
are
selling
to
people
who
cannot
make
a
commitment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
consignment
salesmen
are
--
are
not
exempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
can
they
put
in
number
2?
i
--
i
thought
that
3(k)
is
3(k).
can
--
can
they
supplement
3(k)?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
wonderful.
then
if
you
can
go
beyond
3(k),
i
guess
really
the
question
before
us
is
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
capricious
for
the
agency
not
to
extend
their
--
their
--
their
power
to
supplement
3(k)
to
this
situation,
which
these
people
look
like
salesmen
to
me.
and
so
if
they
can
do
number
2
there,
i
don't
know
why
--
why
the
agency
couldn't
say,
oh,
and
by
the
way
detailers
are
also
included.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
issue
would
be
whether
it's
unreasonable
for
them
not
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure
there
is;
sure
there
is.
but
once
you
--
once
you
concede
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
within
3(k)
and
that
it's
within
the
power
of
the
agency
to
grant
the
exemption
anyway,
then
we
--
we
really
have
a
different
--
a
different
argument
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
we
have
detailers
in
1940?
gee,
that's
a
long
time
ago.
did
we
have
detailers
in
1940?
that's
almost
a
century
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
part
of
a
regular
program
that
the
agency
has
now
instituted,
to
run
around
the
country
and
file
amicus
briefs;
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
right,
to
get
--
instead
of
doing
rulemaking,
instead
of
doing
adjudication,
we're
going
to
file
amicus
briefs,
and
the
court
will
accept
our
view
in
that
amicus
brief
and,
hey,
presto,
we
have
made
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
90,000
of
these
people,
and
you
have
not
--
the
agency
has
not
brought
any
action
for
these,
lo,
these
many
years.
90,000
of
them.
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
say
--
you
come
in
and
say:
oh,
you
have
been
in
violation
of
the
law
in
the
past,
and
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
for
all
these
people
who
you
didn't
give
overtime
to
in
the
past.
i
just
think
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
been
guilty
of
malfeasance
for
70
years,
right?
these
90,000
people
out
there
who
have
been
in
violation
of
the
law
and
the
agency
has
done
not
a
blessed
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
suggest
--
you're
not
arguing
for
a
rule
that
if
--
if
an
individual
does
not
seek
an
opinion
letter,
he's
guilty?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
mind
being
exempt
as
administrative,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they've
changed
their
--
their
view.
justice
antonin
scalia
consignment,
for
one,
which
is
legitimate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
clement,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
section
501
of
the
regulations,
which
--
which
is
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
in
the
blue
brief,
and
was
mentioned
in
the
--
in
the
government's
presentation.
it
says
"requires
that
the
employee
be
engaged
in,
one,
making
sales
within
the
meaning
of
3(k);
or,
two,
obtaining
orders
or
contracts
for
services
or
for
the
use
of
facilities.
"
what
authorization
is
there
for
the
agency
to
invent
number
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
is
it?
i
mean,
you
say,
yes,
yes,
it's
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
pick
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
transfer
of
title
or
a
commitment?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
finding
of
logic,
for
pete's
sake.
these
are
prescriptions.
you
can
only
get
a
prescription
from
a
doctor.
obviously,
the
number
of
prescriptions
--
drugs
sold
depends
upon
the
number
of
prescriptions
given
by
doctors.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
point
you
were
making.
