mr.
goldstein,
doesn't--
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart,
there
is
this
other
regulation
which
is
i
guess
in
the
coverage
section,
779.241,
which
says
that
if
an
employee
performs
any
work
that
in
a
practical
sense
is
an
essential
part
of
consummating
the
sale
of
the
goods,
he
will
be
considered
to
be
selling
the
goods.
so
i
guess
this
question
is
a
two-part
question.
do
you
agree
that
that
regulation
does
cover
the
--
these
detailers?
and
the
second
part
is,
if
you
do,
you
know,
how
does
it
work
that
we
should
understand
sale
one
way
for
purposes
of
coverage
and
another
way
for
purposes
of
exemption?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
seems
a
little
bit
blind
to
the
way
the
industry
actually
works.
the
way
this
industry
actually
works
is
the
real
work
is
done
by
the
detailer
getting
the
doctor
to
say,
yeah,
i'm
going
to
start
prescribing
this
where
it's
medically
appropriate.
the
actual
sales
from
the
company
to
the
pharmacy
just
follows
from
however
successful
the
detailer
is.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
might
be
one
thing
that
they
are
concerned
about,
but
it
may
not
be
the
only
thing.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
these
regulations,
it
seems
as
though
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
draw
a
distinction
between
people
who
actually
consummate
transactions,
transactional
people,
and
people
who
are
pitchmen.
and
what
the
department
of
labor
here
is
saying
is
detailers
are
people
who
make
pitches;
they
are
not
people
who
consummate
the
transactions.
justice
elena
kagan
why
isn't
that
possible?
i
mean,
your
brief
seems
to
suggest
that
in
every
industry
there
needs
to
be
some
group
of
people
who
would
be
classified
as
outside
salesmen,
and
that's
not
necessarily
the
case.
there
may
be
some
industries,
and
here
it's
a
result
of
regulation,
or
it
may
be
because
of
other
business
practices,
where
there
just
isn't
anybody
who's
an
outside
salesman.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
clement,
i
thought
that
in
2004
there
were
two
proposals,
really,
and
one
was
the
proposal
that
was
changed
and
the
other
was
the
proposal
to
get
rid
of
this
promotional
stuff
and
to
allow
people
who
promoted
products
to
qualify
as
outside
salesmen,
and
the
agency
specifically
rejected
that
suggestion.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
clement--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
you've
suggested--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
just
said.
if
--
forget
the
transfer
of
title
business,
but
if
it's
just
--
we're
requiring
a
transaction
here.
and
we're
drawing
a
line
between
people
who
do
transactions
and
people
who
just
advertise
or
make
pitches
or
whatever
you
want
to
do
it.
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statute,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
can
argue
about
is
it
the
only
possible
reading;
you
can
even
argue
about
whether
it's
the
best
possible
reading.
but
it's
surely
a
--
a
possible
reading.
justice
elena
kagan
i
suppose
that
that's
a
question.
for
them,
i
read
their
amicus
briefs
to
sort
of
suggest
two
things.
sometimes
they
just
talk
about
transactions,
and
sometimes
they
talk
about
transfer
of
title.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
that
they
would
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
they've
never
really
seen
a
person
who
makes
transactions
without
transferring
title.
so
i
think
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
mr.
clement,
this
isn't
a
change.
you've
referred
to
it
as
a
change
in
a
lot
of
ways
--
in
a
lot
of
times,
but
what
we
have
here
is
an
agency
that,
for
some
number
of
years,
thought
that
this
was
not
the
most
urgent
problem
on
their
plate.
indeed,
one
would
think
this
is
a
pretty
peculiar
department
of
labor
if
they
thought
that
this
was
the
most
urgent
problem
on
their
plate.
so
they
didn't
enforce
it.
but
now
the
question
has
come
up,
and
they
say
we'll
look
to
our
regulations.
this
falls
on
one
side
of
the
regulation.
now,
you've
been
given
a
gift
for
all
these
years
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
because
--
because
you
were
not
their
most
urgent
problem,
and
so
they
didn't
enforce
their
own
regulations
against
you.
justice
elena
kagan
but
don't
you
think
that
the
way
this
works
--
i
mean,
the
way
we
should
all
hope
it
works
is
that
the
detailer
comes
in,
the
detailer
provides
information,
the
doctor
says,
that's
very
interesting,
i
want
to
think
about
it,
i'm
going
to
think
about
it.
then
the
doctor
reads
some
medical
journals;
then
maybe
the
doctor
goes
to
a
convention
and
talks
to
other
doctors
about
the
product.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
would
hope
that
a
doctor
would
do
before
a
doctor
decided,
i'm
going
to
start
prescribing
this
medicine.
and
the
detail
work
is
a
part
of
that,
but
so
are
many
things
before
the
doctor
actually
decides
to
do
something.
