chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-204,
christopher
v.
smithkline
beecham.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
that
just
--
i
mean,
that's
when
the
doctors
are
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
your
answer,
but
does
your
office
review
the
amicus
filings
in
the
courts
of
appeals
by
the
agencies?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
the
normal
procedure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
--
you
didn't
even
know
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
yet
you
expect
the
industry
to
know
all
about
it,
and
yet
it
escaped
your
attention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
they
don't
do
sales.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
long
list
sort
of
stopped
one
step
short.
they
don't
make
sales.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
let's
say
the
doctor
hears
the
spiel
and
the
doctor
says:
okay,
yours
is
the
first
thing
i
will
think
of,
you
know,
when
i
have
a
patient
with
this
and
this.
i
mean,
is
that
a
sale?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
the
doctor,
as
i
suspect
a
lot
of
doctors
do,
they
listen
to
this
guy,
and
they
say:
okay,
i'll
think
of
--
you
know,
when
it
comes
up,
i'll
think
of
your
product.
and
the
next
guy
comes
in
from
the
other
company
and
he
says:
okay,
when
it
comes
up
i'll
think
of
your
product.
are
those
two
sales
or
no
sale?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
firmer
commitment
when
they
say:
i
will
buy
it.
the
physician
is
just
saying:
i
will
think
of
your
product
when
it
--
when
the
need
comes
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein,
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
