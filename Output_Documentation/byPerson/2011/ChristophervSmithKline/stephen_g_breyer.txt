justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my
point,
actually.
that's
where
i'm
sort
of
bothered,
just
exactly
what
justice
scalia
said,
that
if
you
look
through
what
i've
seen
so
far
by
the
materials,
they're
pretty
evenly
balanced,
and
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
people
who
work
in
this
industry,
and
there's
a
history
of
75
years
of
nobody
said
anything.
so
you
would
think
--
and
it
isn't
the
only
problem
that
has
just
been
recognized
in
other
industries,
too.
if
the
agency
is
going
to
reverse,
not
reverse,
but
suddenly
do
something
it
hasn't
done
for
years,
the
right
way
to
do
it
is
to
have
notice
and
comment,
hearings,
allow
people
to
present
their
point
of
view,
and
then
make
some
rules
or
determine
what
should
happen.
perhaps
they'd
say
for
the
future
let's
do
this,
but
not
let's
give
people
a
windfall
for
the
past.
perhaps
they'd
say
some
and
not
others.
okay?
that's
my
instinctive
reaction,
not
necessarily
legal,
but
informed
by
administrative
law.
but
why
shouldn't
i
try
to
get
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i've
read
those.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
read
those,
and
i
find
them
beautifully
ambiguous.
[laughter]
i'll
go
back
and
read
them
again,
and
if
they're
absolutely
clear,
you
win,
fine,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
right
about
that,
and
so
they're
at
fault,
too.
but
on
the
other
hand,
their
employees
might
have
been
satisfied,
and
this
is
done
to
protect
the
employees.
so
i'm
asking,
not
saying,
but
what
is
the
process
here?
how
do
you
know
--
at
what
level
was
this
agency
decision
made
to
suddenly
go
ahead
with
this?
who
made
it?
what
was
the
input?
how
do
you
know
they're
on
your
side?
you
do
know;
you're
right.
but
i
mean,
what's
the
process
internally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
did
the
secretary
of
labor
herself
or
himself,
depending
on
when
it
was,
consider
this
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
we
don't.
all
right.
so
--
so
the
alternative
is
not
enforcement
actions,
necessarily.
the
alternative
is
for
the
agency
to
focus
on
the
question
and
decide
what
it
actually
wants
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
they
paid
commissions?
if
they're
--
if
the
salesman
or
the
promotion
agent,
as
the
case
may
be,
is
successful
in
his
territory
in
getting
doctors
to
prescribe
the
drug,
does
he
receive
extra
pay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
that
mean?
does
he
--
i
mean,
an
outside
salesman
--
in
one
document,
it
says
is
a
person
who
often
obtains
a
commission
on
his
sales.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
--
i
might
not
have
the
right
words
to
ask
the
question
--
are
these
people,
people
who
in
some
sense
or
other
receive
out
--
commissions
on
their
sales?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
pursue
this
for
a
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
this
is
only
me
speaking.
i
don't
know
how
anybody
else
feels.
if
this
had
come
up
in
1941,
you
wouldn't
have
had
a
chance.
i
would
have
said
look
at
the
statute;
it
says
the
secretary
defines
it.
you
say,
well,
can
you
define
it
in
a
brief?
yes,
you
have
to
be
careful
in
briefs,
but
yes;
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
it's
not
a
question
for
judges,
it's
a
question
for
administrators.
but
now
it's
difficult
for
me
because
of
the
passage
of
75
years.
and
we
can
blame
it
in
part
on
the
industry
or
in
part
on
the
secretary.
there
is
blame
to
go
around.
so
the
question
is,
what
do
i
do
as
a
judge?
and
partly
my
instinct
is
get
somebody
to
decide
this
other
than
a
lawyer
in
the
department
of
labor,
because
this
is
a
hard
question.
and
that's
where
we
come
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
is
he
says
all
right,
fine,
let's
write
that
and
--
and
what
case
do
we
cite?
and
i
don't
agree
with
you,
overturn
auer.
i
think
amicus
briefs
are
often
helpful,
but
use
them
with
care.
and
then
i
have
the
statute
here,
which
talks
about
the
secretary
doing
the
definition
of
"outside
salesman",
and
i
have
lots
of
rules
and
regulations
and
reports,
which
are
fairly
ambiguous
in
my
opinion.
so
you
tell
me
what
to
say.
