could
you
answer
justice
alito's
question?
your
brief
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
suggested
that
a
sale
is
a
--
is
a
transaction,
a
transfer
of
some
sort,
or
at
least
a
promise
to
purchase.
but
your
brief
here
holds
it
a
much
more
rigid
test,
that
there
has
to
be
a
transfer
of
title.
and
he
pointed
to
the
language
of
3(x)
--
3(k),
that
says
"consignment
for
sale",
which
doesn't
have
a
transfer
of
the
title.
so
what
is
the
government's
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i
thought
that
this
whole
system
was
set
up
on
giving
industries
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
government
for
an
opinion
letter,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
saw
in
the
briefing
hundreds
of
opinion
letters
by
hundreds
of
different
industries.
outside
of
this
1945
letter,
did
anybody
else,
any
other
pharmaceutical
company,
ever
set
out
for
the
government
or
seek
an
opinion
letter
that
you're
aware
of?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
give
me
what
your
regulation
is
going
to
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
would
it
exempt
everybody
from
coverage?
meaning,
you
seem
to
be
saying
if
in
some
sense
they
make
sales,
it
seems
that
every
promotional
person
will
be
a
salesman,
that
all
industries
have
to
do
is
put
one
or
two
forms
of
sales
activities
involved
in
the
work
of
their
worker,
and
they
are
exempt.
give
me
your
definition?
as
long
as
it's
in
some
sense,
that
covers
everybody's
exempt?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
seems
like
the
sale
here
is
not
the
primary
duty.
the
sale
here
is
to
schmooze
the
doctor
and
give
him
information.
that's
what
you
said
in
one
of
your
briefs,
your
company
said
in
one
of
its
briefs
in
a
product
liability
litigation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
primary
duty
is
one
of
the
limiting,
and
what
was
the
second
limiting
principle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
that
different
from
a
bonus
that
an
employee
gets?
how
is
it
any
different
than
what
most
companies
do
in
--
in
giving
a
bonus
at
the
end
of
the
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
you
give
me
one
definition
of
"outside
salesmen",
the
one
that
you
prefer
for
us
to
apply
here.
the
department
of
labor
gives
another,
and
the
one
they're
giving
according
to
them
is
a
bright-line
rule.
it's
easy
to
apply.
you
have
to
do
some
sort
of
transfer
of
title.
that's
as
--
their
rule.
tell
me
what
the
--
your
argument
is
that
--
why
your
rule
has
to
win.
meaning,
aren't
we
supposed
to
give
deference
to
the
expertise
of
the
agency,
especially
when
congress
lets
them
define--
