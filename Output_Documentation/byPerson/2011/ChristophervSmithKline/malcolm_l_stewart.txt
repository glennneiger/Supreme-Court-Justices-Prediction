mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
common
ground
in
this
case
that
in
order
to
be
an
outside
salesman
an
employee
must
make
sales,
and
in
theory
there
are
two
different
ways
in
which
respondent
could
have
attempted
to
establish
that
the
psrs
in
this
case
fit
that
criteria.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
dol
regulations
have
since
19
--
i
believe
it's
since
1949,
have
said
to
make
a
sale
within
the
meaning
of
203(k),
the
term
make
--
3(k)
includes
a
transfer
of
title.
and
in
theory
the
verb
"includes"
could
leave
open
the
possibility
that
other
things
could
be
included
as
well.
we've
never
encountered
a
situation
in
which
dol
has
found
a
sale
of
goods
without
a
transfer
of
title,
but
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
justice
alito,
about--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
be
--
with
specific
respect
to
consignments
for
sale,
it
would
have
been
more
precise
to
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
transfer
of
possession
in
contemplation
of
a
transfer
of
title.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
dol
believes
that
they
qualify,
but
not
as
sales
of
goods.
and
if
the
--
the
court
could
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief
on
page
4.
this
is
the
pertinent
regulation
that
refers
to
making
sales
or
obtaining
orders.
and
it
says:
"section
541.500
requires
that
the
employee
be
engaged
in
making
sales
within
the
meaning
of
section
3(k)
of
the
act
or
obtaining
orders
or
contracts
for
services
or
for
the
use
of
facilities.
"
and
dol's
view
is
that
a
rental
agreement
would
be
a
contract
for
services
or
for
the
use
of
facilities.
and
the
way--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
have
supplemented
3(k)
and
they
did
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
--
this
is
discussed
in
the
stein
report
which
was
issued
in
1940;
and
what
had
happened
was
that
the
question
had
arisen
--
and
the
stein
report
lays
this
out
in
a
fair
amount
of
detail
--
the
question
had
arisen
whether
individuals
who
negotiate
for
contracts
to
buy
time
on
the
radio
or
sell
time
--
sell
advertising
space
in
newspapers
or
sell
--
negotiate
contracts
for
a
carriage
of
freight
by
rail
or
truck;
the
question
arose
whether
they
were
outside
salesmen
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
the
stein
report
explained
that
the
wage
and
hour
division
had
taken
the
position
that
they
were
not
because
it
interpreted
"sales"
--
it
appears
to
have
interpreted
"sales"
to
refer
only
to
sales
of
goods,
and
people
who
were
engaged
in
those
sorts
of
businesses
were
not
selling
goods.
but
the
stein
report
said:
however,
these
people
are
commonly
regarded
as
salesmen;
the
contracts
they
negotiate
are
treated
as
sales.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
agency
has
taken
the
position
that,
even
though
it
has
construed
3(k)
to
refer
only
to
sales
of
goods,
that
sales
of
services
or
contracts
for
the
use
of
facilities
can
be
covered.
however,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
the
interaction
between
a
detailer
and
a
physician
and
the
interaction
between
the
--
the
person
who
sells
time
on
the
radio.
the
person--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
--
the
theory
on
which
the
stein
report
proceeded
was
that,
even
though
sales
of
time
on
the
radio
were
not
sales
of
goods,
they
were
still
customarily
regarded
as
sales
and
they
had
the
essential
attributes
of
sales,
namely
an
exchange
of
something
valuable
that
the
seller
possessed
in
return
for
consideration
from
the
buyer.
and
you
don't
have
any
of
that
when
the
detailer
deals
with
the
--
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
that
we
wouldn't
agree
that
this
would
cover
detailers.
that
is,
if
the
relevant
sales
are,
as
we
believe,
gsk's
sales
to
--
the
transfer
of
drugs
to
wholesalers
and
pharmacies
in
return
for
consideration,
the
detailers
don't
play
an
essential
role
in
the
consummation
of
those
sales.
they
don't
participate
in
those
sales.
it's
true
that
their
mission
is
to
engage
in
activities
which
set
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
that
will
make
those
sales
more
likely
to
occur,
but
we
wouldn't
regard
them
as--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
think
much
the
same
thing
could
have
been
said
about
all
the
promotional
workers
that
dol
has
done
with
--
has
dealt
with
in
the
past.
that
is,
the
premise,
the
justification
for
a
company
to
hire
a
promotional
worker,
is
that
the
promotional
activities
will
increase
the
overall
sales
of
the
company,
will
either
directly
or
indirectly
set
in
motion
a
chain
of
events
that
leads
people
to
buy
the
product.
but
dol
has
historically
regarded
those
activities
as
distinct
from
selling
the
product.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
some
employees
may
work
on
commission.
some--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
--
i
don't
think
there
is
necessarily
a
uniform
rule
one
way
or
the
other.
the
stein
report
did
say
in
1940
that,
although
it
was
characteristic
for
outside
salesmen
to
receive
commissions,
that
was
not
the
test,
that
that
was
a
quirk
of
compensation.
the
other
thing
i
would
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
were
detailers
in
that
era,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
i'd
say
two
things,
one
general
and
one
specific
to
detailers.
the
general
thing
is
that
dol
has
consistently
drawn
a
distinction
between
promotional
work--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--okay.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
with
respect
to
where
the
industry
expectation
arose,
we
have
only
one
data
point
or
at
least
only
one
data
point
that
has
been
identified
in
the
briefs.
that
is
the
national
federation
of
independent
small
business
legal
center
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
respondent's
side,
and
then
--
they
identify
one
dol
opinion
letter,
of
which
we
were
previously
unaware,
that
dates
from
1945.
and
in
the
opinion
letter.
the
employer
of
the
detailer
asked
for
an
opinion
to
the
effect
that
its
detailers
were
covered
by
the
administrative
exemption.
that
employer
didn't
request
a
ruling
that
these
were
outside
salesmen.
and
dol--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--internally,
the
--
the
solicitor's
office
at
the
department
of
labor
would
consult
with
the
wage
and
hour
division.
the
solicitor's
name
went
on
the
briefs
both
that
were
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
brief
--
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit
and
also
the
novartis
brief
in
the
second
circuit.
and
the
solicitor's
name
is
on
the
government's
brief
in
this
court.
the
solicitor
is
the
third-highest-ranking
individual
within
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
was
sg
authorization
for
the
amicus
brief
to
be
filed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
clarify
--
well,
to
clarify
the
agency's
view
of
what
the
proper
understanding
of
the
law
is.
and
in
terms
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
maybe
yes,
maybe
no--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
in
comparison
to
the
alternative
step
of
filing
enforcement
actions,
it's
both--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
whether
the
secretary--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
the
agency
has
regarded
the
application
of
its
promotion
sales
regulations
to
the
facts
of
this
case
as
clear.
that
is,
if
you
asked
gsk's
highest
level
management
why
does
it
make
sense
to
employ
detailers,
they
wouldn't
say
because
they
get
these
commitments
from
physicians
which
are
of
value
to
the
company.
the
commitments
or
the
quasi-commitments
from
physicians
in
and
of
themselves
are
of
no
value.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
an
industry
expectation
that
was
based
on
anything
dol
had
said,
it
was
based
on,
as
far
as
we
know,
based
on
the
1945
opinion
letter,
which
said
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
our
argument
is
not
that
they
should
have
known
from
the
--
about
the
opinion
letter.
our
argument
is
that
the
proper
application
of
the
promotion
sales
regulation
to
the
facts
of
this
case
is
pretty
clear,
and
that
if
gsk's
top-level
management
was
asked
to
defend
the
use
of
detailers,
they
would
say
these
people
are
important
because
if
they
persuade
physicians
to
write
more
prescriptions
and
those
are
filled
with
gsk
products,
then
pharmacies
will
reorder
the
drug
and
our
wholesalers
will
reorder
it
from
us.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
return
to
the
1945
opinion
letter,
the
opinion
letter
was
based
on
the
premise
that
the
employees
exercised
discretion
and
independent
judgment
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
that's
what
--
what
dol
said
in
concluding--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
aware
of
only
one
instance.
i
think
this
is
not
a
matter
of
public
record,
but
there
was
one
request
in,
i
believe,
december
of
2007,
for
an
opinion
to
the
effect
that
the
detailers
were
covered
by
the
outside
salesman
exemption.
dol
never
responded
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i'm
not
arguing
for
that
rule.
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
does
--
it
has
phased
out
the
opinion
letter
program
and
gives
other
forms
of
administrative
guidance.
that
is,
dol's
rationale
was
that
the
opinion
letter
program
had
not
been
cost
effective
because
often
the
bottom
line
--
may
i
--
often
the
bottom
line
answer
to
the
question
would
turn
on
factual
nuances
of
a
particular
employer
and
wouldn't
provide
much
guidance
to
others.
and
so
it's
tried
to
provide
forms
of
guidance
that
are
--
speak
to
the
industry
or
a
class
of
employees
as
a
whole.
