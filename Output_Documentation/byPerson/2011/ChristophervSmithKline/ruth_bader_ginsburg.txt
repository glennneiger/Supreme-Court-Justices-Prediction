because
--
because
the
limitation
on
sale
is
they
can't
sell
--
by
federal
law,
they
can't
sell.
and
you're
--
you
are
debating
about
exchange,
sale.
what
strikes
one
about
this
case
is
that
these
are
workers
--
they
work
autonomously.
they
don't
clock
in
and
out.
they
work
outside
the
workplace.
after
they're
trained,
they
have
minimal
supervision.
is
there
any
other
category
of
exempt
workers
that
have
that
kind
of
autonomy
and
yet
come
under
the
wage
and
hours--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
example,
what
are
the
--
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
what
are
the
categories
of
people
that
seem
to
be
autonomous,
not
the
type
that
clocks
in
and
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
what
about
the
extras?
i
mean,
we're
told
that
part
of
this
job
is
to
have
a
good
relationship
with
the
doctors.
it
includes
dinners.
it
may
be
conventions.
entertainment,
maybe
golf.
if
--
if
you're
right,
would
the
time
on
the
golf
course
get
time
and
a
half?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
were
--
you
were
giving
examples,
and
we
just
stopped
at--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--emergency
service
worker.
but
you
said
there
are
many
examples--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
people
who
are
highly
autonomous
and
still
come
under
the
hours
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
to
follow
up
on
other
--
other
categories
of
employee?
you
gave
me
cleaning
workers,
emergency
service
workers.
are
any
of
those
categories
people
who
get
paid
commissions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
malcolm
--
mr.
stewart,
is
it
--
is
it
true
that
that
option
is
no
longer
available,
that
the
department
of
labor
no
longer
gives
opinion
letters?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
also
says,
it
also
says
promotional
work
incidental
to
sales
made
by
someone
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
nonexempt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
these,
these
sales
--
i
mean,
eventually
there
is
a
sale
to
a
hospital,
to
a
pharmacy,
and
that
sale
is
not
made
by
the
detailer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
got
to
be
non-binding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
this,
this
opinion
letter.
the
request
is
put
in
by
the
pharmaceutical
company
and
they
want
an
exemption
under
administrative
employees.
in
the
department
of
labor's
response
allowing
that
exemption,
it
says
that
these
detailers,
and
they
use
the
word
"detailers",
medical
detailers,
are
engaged
in
a
form
of
promotional
or
missionary
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
letter
goes
on
to
say
that
these
detailers
are
engaged
in
a
form
of
promotion
not
having
for
its
object
the
making
of
specific
transactions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
your
years,
it's
suspect
for
two
reasons.
one
is
we
are
told
that
in
the
early
years,
at
least,
before
there
were
regulations
restricting
the
sale
of
prescription
drugs,
that
these
detailers
did
two
things.
they
did
have
their
informational
function,
but
they
also
did
direct
sales
to
pharmaceutical
companies,
to
hospitals.
so
for
at
least
20
years
of
those
70
years
these
people
were
engaged
in
what
the
department
would
call
sales.
so
that's
suspect.
and
then
when
we
have
the
commitment,
the
opinion
letter
that
says:
we
have
a
category
for
these
people;
they
are
engaged
in
instruction,
in
information;
they
are
not
engaged
in
sales;
but
because
they
are
so
independent,
we
rank
them
as
administrative
--
in
the
particular
case
we
rank
them
as
administrative
people.
so
it's
not
as
though
there
was
a
sudden
about-face
as
you
suggest.
we
have
a
categorization
as
--
as
administrative
employees,
but
not
sales
employees,
and
we
have
a
history
of
these
detailers
at
one
time
actually
selling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
claim
--
did
you
claim
exemption
as
administrative
employee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
--
then
that
would
be
still
open
if
you
lose
on
the
outside
sales?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
--
did
the
pharmaceutical
companies
request
--
ever
in
this
period,
request
a
ruling,
a
rulemaking
on
the
status
of
these
psrs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
an
opinion
letter,
they
said.
i
thought
they
said
that
was
an
opinion
letter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
asked
if
there
was
a
request
from
the
pharmaceutical
companies
for
a
rulemaking
on
the
proper
classification
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
--
why
must
you
look
to
an
amicus
brief?
why
not
just
look
to
the
regulations
that
define
--
the
regulations
that
define
"sale"
and
that
define
"promotion".
the
541.503
says
promotion
work
incidental
to
a
sale
made
by
somebody
else
is
not
exempt.
why
do
we
get
into
the
amicus
brief
when
we
have
in
these
541
regulations
a
definition
of
sales
on
the
one
hand,
promotion
on
the
other,
and
then
this
statement
that
promotion
work
incidental
to
sale
made
by
somebody
else
is
not
exempt?
why
doesn't
--
why
isn't
that
the
answer
to
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
pharmaceutical
company
have
a
sales
force?
i
mean,
who
sells
to
the
wholesalers,
the
pharmacies,
and
the
hospitals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
--
there
are
people
who
sell
to
them.
there
may
be
only
a
few,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
they
exempt,
too?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
actual
sellers
from
the
--
the
people
on
the
staff
of
the
pharmaceutical
company
who
sell
to
the
wholesalers,
pharmacies,
and
hospitals,
are
they
exempt?
