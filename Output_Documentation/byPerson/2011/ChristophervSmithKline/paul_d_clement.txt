mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
are
two
pharmaceutical
sales
representatives.
they
were
hired
for
a
sales
job.
they
were
given
sales
training.
they
attend
sales
conferences.
they
are
assigned
to
sales
territory,
and
they
are
evaluated
and
compensated
as
sales
people.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
disagree.
we
think
they
do
make
sales
in
the
way
that
is
relevant
in
this
industry,
and
we
do
think
they
make
sales
in
some
sense,
which
is
the
practical
construction
the
agency
has
always
put
on
the
sales
requirement
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
but
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
could,
there's
two
important
qualifications
that
avoid
the
slippery
slope
concerns
you're
talking
about.
one
is
it's,
i
think,
common
ground
among
everybody
that
you
--
to
qualify
for
any
exemption
or
certainly
all
of
these
relevant
exemptions
here,
it
has
to
be
your
primary
duty.
so
you
can't
just
slip
in
a
little
sales
activity
for
something
and
get
that
person
qualified.
the
other
thing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
your
honor,
the
commitment
is
very
important
in
this
industry.
it
is
the
objective
of
the
sales
call.
it's
to
get
a
commitment
to
prescribe
when
medically
necessary.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
is
prologue
to
that,
and
there
is
efforts
to
promote
before
you
get
that
particular
sale.
but
the
regulations
address
that
particularly,
and
they
say,
as
long
as
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
second
limiting
principle
is
actually
what
i'm
talking
about
now,
which
is
if
you
look
at
503,
which
are
the
regulations
that
draw
the
distinction
between
promotion
and
between
being
outside
sales,
they
do
not
say
that
promotion
is
nonexempt
activity.
what
they
say
is
it
depends
who
does
the
promotion.
and
as
long
as
the
outside
salesperson
does
the
promotion
in
conjunction
with
his
or
her
own
sales
or
solicitations,
then
that
is
exempt
activity.
and
what
they
were
trying
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
not
covered.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you're
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
reason
that
503
draws
a
distinction
between
promotional
activity
in
conjunction
with
the
salesperson's
own
sales
or
promotional
activity
with
respect
to
somebody
else's
sales
is
they
are
concerned
about
the
consideration
where
somebody
else
is
going
to
follow
up
with
the
same
customer
to
close
the
deal.
and
if
you
look
at
the
regulatory
commentary,
that's
what
they're
concerned
--
they
don't
want
to
sort
of
have
double
counting,
where
somebody
promotes
with
a
sales
target
and
then
somebody
else
follows
up
to
close
the
sale.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kagan,
i
really
think
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
as
a
whole
and
the
commentary
in
the
stein
report
and
the
weiss
report,
they
are
not
worried
about
sorting
out
the
pitchmen
because
they
understand
that
a
classic
outside
salesperson
is
a
pitchman
who
then
tries
to
get
a
commitment
to
buy
or
some
other
commitment
from
the
sales
target.
so
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
really
distinguishing
not
between
pitchmen
and
sales
people,
but
between
what
they
refer
to
as
missionary
men
or
people
who
pave
the
way
for
somebody
else
to
make
the
sale.
and
i
really
think
that's
the
focus
of
the
503
regulation.
and
so
the
government's
argument
really
boils
down
to
the
notion
that
there's
nobody
in
this
industry
that
makes
enough
of
a
commitment
with
the
doctor
for
anybody
to
be
involved
in
anything
but
promotion
with
the
doctor.
and
that
seems--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kagan,
it's
theoretically
possible,
but
it
would
be
odd,
especially
in
an
industry
that
employs
90,000
people,
in
order
to
get
a
commitment
to
prescribe
from
the
doctor.
and
i
think
if
you--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
commitment
is
generally
not
in
writing,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
know
that
anything
would
turn
on
whether
it
was
in
writing
or
not
because
what--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
it's
important
for
the
commitment
not
to
be
binding
because
of
the
nature
of
the
doctor's
role.
nobody
wants
to
go
into
a
doctor's
office,
let
alone
these
sales
people,
and
say:
look,
whoever
is
the
next
person
who
walks
in
the
door,
prescribe
them
the
product.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
not
the
kind
of
commitment
they
are
looking
for,
justice
kennedy.
they
are
looking
for
a
commitment
that
--
sometimes
it's
the
next
patient
that
presents
the
condition
for
which
the
medicine
is
medically
appropriate,
that
they
will
prescribe.
and
if
you
think
just
practically--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
has
to
be
non-binding,
i
agree.
but
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
but
you
can
have
a
non-binding
commitment
in
writing.
you
can
have
a
binding
commitment
that's
oral,
as
long
as
it's
--
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
statute
of
frauds
here.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
binding
nature
is
not
dispositive
either.
you
can
have
a
situation
--
look,
if
i
agree
as
--
that
i
am
going
to
buy
something,
i
can
often
return
it.
sometimes
there
is
a
cooling-off
period,
things
like
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
love
to,
justice
kennedy.
i
think,
to
the
contrary,
i
think
that
--
i
mean,
the
government
actually
ironically
says
that
the
2004
rulemaking,
which
was
the
last
time
there
was
any
rulemaking,
didn't
change
anything
substantively.
we
think
that
is
wrong.
we
actually
think
there
was
an
important
substantive
change
to
the
503(c)
regulations
and
others
which
addressed
the
following
problem,
which
is
not
that
the
basic
role
of
the
outside
salesperson
has
changed,
but
the
technology
has
changed
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
silly
to
draw
a
distinction
between
whether
the
salesperson
actually
takes
the
order
and
writes
it
down
or
gets
a
form
in
triplicate,
or
rather
gets
a
commitment
to
buy
from
the
sales
target
who
then
actually
enters
the
order
on
a
computer
on
their
own.
and
that
i
think
is
the
specific
situation
that
the
agency
was
confronted
with.
and
in
2004
they
said:
we
don't
want
things
to
turn
on
who
enters
the
order,
whether
it's
the
customer
on
their
own
computer
or
the
outside
salesperson.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely,
justice
kagan,
but
there
has
always
been
an
effort
to
try
to
get
all
promotional
people
treated
as
being
exempt.
but
that
is
different
from
what
is
being
asked
for
here,
which
is
the
last
person
who
makes
a
visit
to
the
person
who
places
the
relevant
order
in
the
industry
and
gets
the
commitment
from
that
person.
that,
in
contrast
to
general
promotion,
often
directed
at
the
world
at
large,
has
always
been
the
hallmark
of
a
sale
in
the
department's
own
flexible
approach.
and
i
think
that's
really
important.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
--
i
want
to
say
two
things
about
that.
one
is
to
say
obviously
that
may
depend
a
little
bit
on
how
the
particular
role
was
described.
if
you
are
reading
from
the
1945
opinion
letter,
i
mean,
that
may
be
somewhat
different.
but
i
do
think
that
what's
important
here
is
that
promotional
activity
itself
is
not
problematic.
promotional
activity
is
exempt
as
long
as
its
in
conjunction
with
the
person's
own
sales
or
solicitations
is
the
word
of
the
regulation.
so
i
don't
think
that
is
dispositive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
and
again,
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
take
issue
with
that
and
say,
no,
there
is
an
interest
in
getting
a
specific
commitment.
it
is
commitment
to
prescribe.
it
may
be
somewhat
--
it
is
non-binding,
and
it
may
be
somewhat
forward-looking,
but
i
don't
think
that
distinguishes
this
industry
from
any
industry.
it's
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
say
--
i
mean,
certainly
as
the
regulatory
environment
has
changed,
the
nature
of
how
the
sales
are
transacted
in
this
industry
have
changed,
but
i
think
the
focus
is
very
much
on
the
doctors
appropriately
because
they're
the
ones
that
placed
the
order.
but
i
also
want
to
be
responsive
to
the
administrative
exemption.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
wouldn't,
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
i
do
want
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they've
changed
their
view
on
that,
too.
and
i
certainly
don't
want
this
court
to
think
that
the
industry
somehow
has
the
administrative
exemption
as
an
ace
up
their
sleeve
or
in
their
back
pocket.
and
it's
really
the
same
exact
issue,
because,
once
again,
the
agency
has
changed
their
view.
and
once
again,
their
view
is
not
based
on
anything
that
has
to
do
with
label--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
did,
your
honor,
in
the
district
court.
it's
not
before
this
court
because
we
got
summary
judgment
in
our
favor
on
the
outside
sales
exemption.
but
i
really
would
think
it
would
be
a
--
a
mistake
for
this
court
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
would,
justice
ginsburg.
but
you're
just
deferring
the
same
inquiry,
because
the
government's
position
once
again
is
after
70
years
of
having
the
industry
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
these
individuals
were
exempt,
they
now
have
changed
their
mind.
and,
again,
their
view
has
everything
to
do
with
fda
regulation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
nothing
to
do--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
nothing
to
do
with
labor
policy,
because
what
they
say
is
that
now
because
of
the
government's
own
off-label
prosecutions,
these
outside
salespeople
have
to
stick
to
a
script
and
--
in
order
to
avoid
off-label
liability.
and
because
they
have
to
stick
to
the
script,
they
are
told
they
don't
exercise
sufficient
discretion
to
come
within
the
administrative
exemption.
and
the
problem
here
is
the
labor
department,
instead
of
looking
at
this
and
making
a
rational
judgment
about
labor
policy
and
whether
these
individuals
who
make
$93,000
on
--
for
the
median
should
rationally
be
the
kind
of
workers
that
are
protected
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
instead,
they're
looking
at
things
that
have
everything
to
do
with
fda
regulation
and
nothing
to
do
with
labor
policy.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
he
receives
incentive
compensation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
the
answer
is
--
for
the
petitioners
on
this
record,
the
answer
is
yes.
they're
not
the
commissions
that
are
a
one-to-one
correspondence,
but
what
they
do
is
they
receive
substantial
incentive
compensation,
about
25
percent
of
the
total,
and
it's
based
on
the
sales
of
the
product
in
their
sales
territory.
so,
if
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--certainly,
based
on
the
facts
in
this
record,
it
--
at
the
time
of
this
case,
it's
much
more
tied
to
the
performance
of
the
product
in
the
sales
territory.
and
i
don't
think
that's
--
you
know,
it's
not
based
on
the
company's
overall
performance--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor,
two
responses
to
that.
one
is
you
can't
defer
to
the
labor
department's
preferred
construction,
because
it's
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
this
idea
that
you
have
to
have
a
transfer
of
title
cannot
be
squared
with
3(k);
it
cannot
be
squared,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
with
some
of
the
--
the
own
advice
they've
given,
which
is
all
you
need
is
a
commitment
to
buy.
that's
what
they've
told
people
since
1949.
there's
an
example
in
that
weiss
report
from
involving
a
jobber
where
you
have
a
situation
where
somebody's
treated
as
an
outside
salesperson
even
though
they
never
have
title
over
the
product.
so
they
get
the
commitment
to
buy
from
the
sales
target,
and
then
a
jobber
who
works
for
a
different
employer
is
the
one
that
transfers
title.
that's
at
page
11
of
the
nfib
brief,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it.
so--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
is
a
possible
reading,
justice
kagan.
but
it's
not
the
one
that
the
labor
department
has
advanced
in
their
amicus
brief.
so
you
can't
defer
to
that.
i
mean,
you
can
decide
that
it's
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
if
you
want,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
with
respect,
justice
kagan,
that's
one
of
the
many
problems
with
deferring
to
amicus
briefs.
because
when
an
agency
gives
guidance
in
an
interpretative
rule
or
something,
there's
one
place,
and
they
provide
"the"
answer.
now,
i
don't
know
if
the
government
wants
you
to
defer
to
the
--
defer
to
the
argument
on
page
12
or
the
argument
on
page
20
or
the
argument
on
page
24.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect,
they
have
--
no
--
with
respect,
they
have
seen
that
person.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
consignment
is
in
the
statute.
but
this
jobber
example
is
right
out
of
the
weiss
report
in
1949,
and
the
outside
salesperson
in
that
case
never
had
title.
the
title
comes
from
the
jobber
who
works
for
somebody
else.
so
the
salesperson
in
that
instance
never
had
title,
not
even
in
the
chain
of
distribution.
yet
they
say
that
is
a
clear
case
where
the
person
is
an
outside
salesperson
and
exempt.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
understand
from
the
government
that
there
was
a
request
in
2007
and
that
the
labor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
was
a
request
for
an
opinion
letter.
i'm
sorry--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
there
wasn't,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
think
that
actually
cuts
in
our
favor,
because
in
2004,
a
lot
of
companies
were
coming
in
with
things
where
they
thought
it
was
unclear,
where
they
thought
there
was
some
doubt,
and
asking
for
clarification.
this
was
so
well
understood
that
the
outside
sales
exemption,
or
perhaps
the
administrative
exemption,
covered
the
outside
sales
force
of
this
industry--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
ask
you
not
to
be
bound
by
having
to
cite
a
case.
i
would
ask
you
to
just
use
the
following
reasoning,
though,
which
i
think
is
100
percent
--
and
there's
plenty
of
cases
you
could
cite
as
perhaps
cf.
cites.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
let's
start
--
let's
start
with
fox
and
just
the
basic
notion
that
in
administrative
law,
if
you're
going
to
change
your
position,
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
you're
making
a
change.
i
think
at
a
minimum
here,
if
they're
going
to
impose
this
kind
of
massive
retroactive
liability
on
this
industry--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
kagan,
here's
the
thing.
we
can
quibble
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
change
in
their
position
or
whether
they
just
didn't
have
a
position
before,
but
i
think
the
important
thing
is
they've
imposed,
by
taking
this
position
in
an
amicus
brief
and
asking
for
deference
to
it,
massive
liability
on
this
industry.
the
phrma
brief
estimates
it's
billions
of
dollars.
now,
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--here's
the
answer
as
to
why
that's
not
the
answer,
and
then
let
me
circle
back
and
say
why,
if
you
are
going
to
err
on
one
side
or
the
other,
you
shouldn't
err
on
the
side
of
imposing
massive
retroactive
liability.
the
reason
that
that
is
not
a
simple
matter
of
deferring
to
that
is
because
that
same
regulation
earlier
says
that
promotional
work
is
exempt
if
it
is
in
conjunction
with
the
individual's
own
sales
or
solicitations.
now,
i
happen
to
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
these
--
by
getting
this
commitment,
which
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
commitment
to
buy,
which
is
what
the
regulations
and
regulatory
interpretations
have
always
said
is
a
sale
in
some
sense,
i
think
these
are
sales.
certainly--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it's
not
this
kind
of
outside
sales
force.
it's
a
much
less
sales-oriented
transaction.
the
phrma
amicus
brief,
for
example,
gives
the
example
of
a
company
that
has
2,000
outside
sales
reps
and
10
people
that
handle
the
movement
of
transfer
of
product
to
the
wholesalers
and
the
distributors.
if
you
look
at
district
court's
opinion
at
the
page
42a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
district
court
addresses
this
issue
and
i
think
gets
it
exactly
right,
which
is
the
reason
there
is
not
a
sales
effort
focused
on
the
wholesalers
and
distributors
is
because
their
job
is
to
have
on
stock
the
kind
of
medicines
that
physicians
are
prescribing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there
is
a
handful
of
people,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that's
--
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
anomalous
about
that.
most
industries
have
some
sales
force
that
operates
on
the
wholesale--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
at
least
not
under
the
outside
sales
exemption,
in
part
because
they
are
not
outside,
in
part
because
they
are
not
really
engaged
in
a
sales
effort.
it
does
them
no
good
--
if
they
can
convince
some
wholesaler
or
distributor
that
the
gsk
product
is
far
superior
to
a
competitor's
product
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
all
because
as
a
result
of
that
--
they
need
to
have
product
that
actual
doctors
are
writing
prescriptions
for.
that's
what
drives
sales
in
this
industry.
there
is
nothing
anomalous
about
that.
if
you
think
about
any
industry,
sales
activity
is
always
directed
at
the
people
who
place
orders.
in
this
industry,
because
of
the
learned
intermediary
doctrine,
the
person
who
places
the
order
is
the
doctor,
not
the
ultimate
end
user.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
think
it
is,
your
honor,
but
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
that,
certainly
at
the
point
that
the
doctor
then,
when
he
sees
the
next
patient,
writes
the
prescription,
i
think
at
that
point
i
think
there's
a
sale;
because
again,
what
the
regulations
and
regulatory
history
looks
for
is
a
--
is
a
commitment
to
buy.
that's
the
relevant
commitment
to
buy.
that's
the
order
in
this
industry--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
they
are
probably
two
sales,
your
honor.
but
you
know,
it's
the
same
thing
--
imagine
somebody
who's,
you
know,
just
sitting
in
their
house
and
they
get
an
encyclopedia
salesperson.
and
they
say,
you
know,
i'll
--
maybe
i'll
buy
that.
that
looks
good,
i'll
buy
it.
and
they
say,
but
you
know,
maybe
the
state
law
has
a
law
that
says
you
have
got
to
wait
24
hours
before
you
put
the
order
in,
in
the
computer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
--
well,
if
--
i
mean,
what
i
was
suggesting
is
maybe
you
are
talking
about
a
state
that
has
a
24-hour
waiting
rule
or
something
like
that.
so
it's
a
commitment
that,
sure,
i'm
going
to
enter
the
order
in
24
hours.
well,
maybe
another
encyclopedia
salesmen
comes
in,
in
12
hours
and
he
gives
another
commitment.
one
of
the
two
people
he
is
going
to
put
the
order
in,
and
one
of
the
two
people
will
certainly
have
finally
had
a
sale.
i
think
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
justice
kagan.
but
you
don't
want
to
look
at
this
like
it's
an
isolated,
one-time,
you
know,
sort
of
interaction.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
happens
in
this
industry,
like
other
sales
industry,
is
there
are
multiple
trips.
the
detailer
goes
there
maybe
the
first
time
and
lays
the
ground
work.
then
maybe
the
doctor
reads
some
other
information.
then
maybe
on
the
final
visit,
after
all
that
information
is
there,
finally
the
detailer
gets
the
commitment
to
prescribe
to
appropriate
patients.
i
think
one
way
to
think
about
the
absurdity
of
making
the
difference
turn
on
the
prescription
is
to
compare
this
salesperson
to
another
salesperson
of
medical
devices
who
goes
in,
but
these
are
medical
supplies
that
the
doctor
uses
in
the
doctor's
office.
now,
they're
both
hired
for
their
sales
experience,
they
both
get
sales
training,
they
both
have
a
sales
territory.
they're
sitting
in
the
same
doctor's
waiting
room,
waiting
for
the
same
doctor;
they
have
samples
in
their
bags,
and
they
both
get
a
commitment
from
the
doctor.
now,
what
sense
does
it
make
as
a
matter
of
the
flsa
and
its
labor
policies
to
say
one
of
those
people
is
exempt
and
the
other
one
is
not
exempt,
because
for
perfectly
sensible
reasons,
we
say
that
one
of
those
products
is
a
prescription
where
the
doctor
writes
the
order
and
then
with
that
order
the
end
user,
the
ultimate
end
user,
can
make
the
purchase
at
the
pharmacy,
whereas
the
other
one--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
you
heard
the
government's
explanation
and,
as
you
suggest,
if
the
government's
explanation
is
right,
then
this
shouldn't
be
a
matter
of
just
trying
to
limit
things
to
--
to
the
3(k)
definition.
i
think,
even
though
--
at
the
3(k)
definition,
though,
if
you
look
at
that
definition,
it
has
every
hallmark
of
being
broad
and
functional
and
flexible.
i
would
want
to
make
one
very
important
point,
though,
about
the
ultimate
question
here,
because
ultimately
the
decision
whether
to
go
one
way
or
another
on
this
issue
has
remarkable
significance
for
retroactive
imposition
of
liability.
we
all
know
that
retroactive
rulemaking
is
disfavored.
well,
think
about
the
consequences
here.
you
have
massive
liability,
between
4
and
6
years
of
effective
time
and
a
half,
because
of
the
way
that
the
statute
works.
it
has
time
and
a
half
plus
liquidated
damages.
you
are
talking
about
people
who
are
very
well
paid,
close
to
six
figures.
so
unlike
the
classic
worker
who
you
might
think
is
covered
by
the
flsa,
who
is
a
relatively
low
hourly
worker,
the
amounts
of
damages
here
are
quite
significant.
of
course,
the
effort
to
try
to
reconstruct
these
people's
hours,
given
that
they
were
told
they
were
exempt
and
they
were
outside
the
office,
trying
to
reconstruct
how
many
overtime
hours
they
actually
worked
is
going
to
be
a
crapshoot
at
best.
so
if
you
think
about
all
of
that,
and
then
you
think
about,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
the
other
option,
which
is
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
--
may
i
answer?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
start
by
citing
--
i
know
it's
not
always
in
fashion
to
cite
lower
court
opinions,
but
i
would
start
by
citing
judge
posner's
opinion
in
yi,
because
the
seventh
circuit
there,
a,
a
very
distinguished
panel,
judge
posner,
judge
wood,
and
one
other
judge,
the
three
of
them
considered
this
question
--
judge
sykes,
i'm
sorry;
it
slipped
my
mind,
a
very
distinguished
judge.
[laughter]
the
--
it
--
the
point
being
that
he
said
along
these
lines
that
the
70
years
of
history
makes
a
significant
difference.
and
here's
the
thing.
just
like
you
expect
an
agency
to
confront
a
change
of
position,
you
would
at
least
expect
an
agency
to
confront
the
retroactive
consequences
and
in
that
sense
address
them
and
make
sense
of
it.
and
i
would
just
simply
say
this,
which
is
if
you
had
a
rulemaking
you
could
bring
in
all
of
the
affected
parties,
including
the
current
sales
representatives,
who
are
not
the
ones
bringing
these
lawsuits,
whose
jobs
are
going
to
be
changed,
and
you
could
make
a
comprehensive
view,
as
opposed
to
just
getting
one
side
of
an
ongoing
litigation
and
then
making
a
decision
about
an
amicus
brief.
thank
you.
