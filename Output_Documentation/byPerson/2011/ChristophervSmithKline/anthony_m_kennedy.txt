and
these
are
all
--
these
are
all
within
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
occupations
or
pursuits
that
are
not
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
because
--
on
the
rationale
that
they
are
out,
that
they're
unsupervised,
and
so
forth.
in
other
words,
if
you
were
in
the
case
of
the
respondent,
would
you
--
would
you
have
any
close
analogies
to
areas
that
are
not
--
that
are
exempt;
in
other
words,
that
they
wouldn't
be
salesmen,
but
there'd
be
some
other
classifications
to
fit
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
gone
on
for
years,
and
you're
--
instead
of
doing
a
regulation,
amended
regulation,
as
justice
breyer
indicates,
you're
filing
amicus
briefs
quietly
in
different
--
different
courts.
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
nearly
as
fair
or
straightforward
or
as
candid
as
--
as
an
agency
ought
to
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
--
what
is
this
commitment?
is
the
commitment
in
writing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
lawful
to
make
it
--
put
it
in
writing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
lawful
to
put
it
in
writing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
sounds
to
me
it's
not
a
commitment,
unless
the
doctor
says:
well,
i'll
look
at
this,
this
is
interesting;
i'll
go
home
and
read
your
material,
i'll
think
about
it.
is
that
--
is
that
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
why
it's
not
in
writing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
i'm
not
well
versed
in
all
--
in
all
of
the
specifics,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
federal
government
has
expressed
new
concerns,
has
new
regulations,
new
rules
about
these
outside
sales.
does
that
mean
that
the
nature
of
the
work
has
changed
in
the
last
5
or
10
years,
so
that
the
years
we
are
talking
about
is
not
relevant?
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
case
that
i
cite
if
this
opinion
is
written
the
way
you
--
you
propose,
and
the
--
this
court
says,
well,
this
has
been
years,
or
maybe
in
10
years
if
you
take
the
new
regulations
as
setting
a
new
regime,
and
the
department
has
never
made
an
objection,
and
therefore,
it
follows
that
the
department's
interpretation
is
implausible
or
improper,
and
then
i
cite
some
case
from
our
court.
what
--
how
do
i
write
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
like
one.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
district
court
here
made
a
finding
--
this
is
at
42(a)
of
--
of
the
--
the
appendix
for
the
petitioners:
"sales
volume
was
directly
and
exclusively
driven
by
the
number
of
prescriptions
written
by
physicians,
and
plaintiffs'
job
was
to
encourage
such
prescriptions.
"
