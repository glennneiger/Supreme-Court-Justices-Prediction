mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
congress
directed
the
secretary
of
labor
to
quote/unquote
"define
and
delimit"
the
statute's
outside
salesmen
exemption.
by
regulation,
the
secretary
provided
that
an
outside
salesman
is
one
who
makes
sales
rather
than
promoting
sales
by
others.
in
further
guidance,
the
secretary
elaborated
that
nonexempt
promotion
includes
either,
one,
a
conversation
where
there
can
be
no
commitment
or,
two,
one
where
there
would
be
no
exchange
with
the
employer.
now,
everyone
agrees
that
a
pharmaceutical
detailer
engages
in
promotion.
they
tout
drugs
to
doctors.
everyone
agrees
that
there
can't
be
a
commitment
to
issue
a
prescription.
everyone
agrees
that
a
prescription
is
not
an
exchange
with
a
pharmaceutical
company.
but
nonetheless,
the
respondent
argues
that
pharmaceutical
detailers
sell
drugs
directly
to
doctors
as
a
matter
of
law.
they
say
that
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
secretary's
regulation
incorporates
the
definition
of
flsa,
which
is
in
the
blue
brief
in
the
appendix
at
page
1.
that
definition,
which
is
section
203(k),
provides
--
it's
the
second
provision
on
the
page
--
""sale"
or
"sell"
includes
any
sale,
exchange,
contract
to
sell,
consignment
for
sale,
shipment
for
sale,
or
other
disposition.
"
and
what
you
will
not
find
in
that
language
is
anything
that
contradicts
the
two
points
the
secretary
has
made,
which
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
commitment
or
that
at
the
very
least,
there
has
to
be
an
exchange
with
the
employer.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
an
arrangement
for
transfer
of
title,
and
that's
why
it's
critical.
but
it
says
a
consignment
for
sale,
the
sale
being
the
transfer
of
title.
but
in
all
events,
this
case
is
not
a
fight
about
transferring
title
or
some
lesser
form
of
exchange,
because
there's
no
exchange
between
the
doctor
and
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is
an
agreement
for
a
transfer
of
title,
and
i
believe
there--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize.
there
is
not
a
transfer
of
title,
but
there
is
an
agreement
for
transfer
of
title.
they
--
just
to
be
clear,
the
government
says
the
definition
of
"sale"
includes
a
transfer
of
title.
and
so
all
i'm
pointing
out,
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
the
definition
--
i
apologize
for
not
answering--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--oh,
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
well,
i
apologize
if
i've
created
some
kind
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
i
believe
--
i
will
allow
you
--
i
apologize
saying
"i
will
allow
you".
the--
[laughter]
you
can
do,
i
know,
whatever
you
want.
the
government
can
explain
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
all
right.
it
is
--
the
statute
refers
to
a
consignment
for
sale.
i
believe
they're
defining
a
sale
in
that
phrase.
but
in
all
events,
the
debate
over
whether
it
includes
or
is
limited
to
a
transfer
of
title
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
what
the
--
because
all
the
statute
requires
is
that
there
at
the
very
least
be
some
exchange
of
some
part.
there's
going
to
be
an
--
a
binding
agreement,
a
commitment,
and
that
commitment
will
involve
an
exchange
with
the
employer.
what
happens
in
pharmaceutical
detailing
is
that
there
can't
be
any
commitment
to
issue
a
prescription
at
all--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
sorry.
so
your
premise
is
that
they
are
exempt
to
begin
with?
there
--
i
can
tell
you
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
employees
who
do
work
outside
the
workplace
and
are
substantially
more
autonomous
than
are
pharmaceutical
detailers,
who
have
to
operate
from
very
strict
scripts.
there
are
--
it's
literally--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
well,
you
can
have
emergency
service
workers
that
are
working
outside.
there
are
lots
of
people
--
so,
for
example,
you
may
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
a
police
officer
or
a
fireman,
an
ambulance
driver.
they
are
constantly
outside
the
office.
you
can
also
have
lots
of
different
kinds
of
promotion--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
that
--
my--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
not
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
they
are
expected
--
the
joint
appendix
explains
--
to
be
in
the
doctors'
offices
between
8:30
and
5:00
p.m.
they
work
additional
time.
the
fact
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
--
but
that
is
when
they
are
supposed
to
be
in
the
doctors'
offices.
that's
dictated
by
the
company.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
a
couple
things
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
there
actually
are
very
strict
restrictions.
that
kind
of
activity
is
under
the
phrma
code,
which
is
trying
to
interpret
federal
law,
is
actually
very
heavily
restricted.
but
whatever
it
is
that
the
employee
is
doing
to
further
the
employment
relationship
is
going
to
be
hours
on
duty.
it
is
really
important
i
think
that
while
it
is
true
that
a
pharmaceutical
detailer
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
an
outside
salesman,
the
one
they
don't
have
is
selling.
and
that
is
the
line
that
congress
drew.
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
another
example
would
be
insurance
adjusters.
there
are
people
who
are
outside
cleaning
people
that
are
not
--
that
don't
have
any--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
they
absolutely
are.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
would,
but
they
would
all
be
one
of
two
things.
they
would
either
fall
within
the
administrative
exemption,
which
is,
justice
ginsburg,
what
is
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
talked
about
people
who
have
a
lot
of
autonomy,
and
which
is
not
true
of
detailers
--
or
some
other
exemption.
so,
to
give
an
example,
certain
outside
buyers
are
exempt
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
a
good
--
that's
a
good
example,
because
if
you're
an
outside
buyer
of
poultry,
then
you
are
exempt,
but
if
you're
an
outside
buyer
of
meat,
you
aren't.
it
is
one
of
a
lot
of
different
places
--
there
are
50-some
exemptions
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
congress
drew
incredibly
fine
lines.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
a
sale,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
there's
neither
a
commitment
--
remember,
the
commitment
is
illegal
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
if
that
is
the
commitment,
then
all
of
promotion
i
think
is
going
to
be
a
sale,
because
every
promoter
who
walks
up
to
you
on
the
street
saying,
will
you
try
my
product,
will
you
go
into
the
store,
is
trying
to
get
you
to
say,
i'll
go
in.
and
that
is
much
more
of
a
direct
commitment
than
you
saying,
i
will
consider
it
in
an
appropriate
circumstance.
the
commitment
by
a
doctor
is
precatory
at
most.
they
do
not
make
any
commitment
in
any
instance
that
can
be
binding
in
any
way
that
they
will
prescribe
a
drug
for
anyone.
and
remember,
there
is
the
second
--
the
second
distinction.
so
that's
one.
but
the
second
is
that,
remember,
there
is
a
purchase
in
your
hypothetical
of
framing,
a
purchase
from
the
framing
store.
but
the
second
part
of
the
secretary's
guidance
is
that
when
the
doctor
decides
to
issue
a
prescription
they
are
not
exchanging
anything
with
the
drug
company.
there
--
nothing
is
acquired
from
the
drug
company.
that
is
a
very
significant
difference.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
there
are
two
things.
the
first
is
the
commitment,
and
they
are
not
selling
anything
to
the
doctor.
remember,
just
to
frame
this
industry,
the
pharmaceutical
company
sells
its
products;
it
sells
them
to
pharmaceutical
wholesalers,
which
sell
them
to
pharmacies
--
pardon
me
--
which
sell
them
to
customers,
which
have
a
relationship
with
a
doctor,
who
may
or
may
not
have
met
with
a
detailer.
there
is
a
sale
here
in
this
industry,
but
it
is
to
a
pharmaceutical
detailer,
and
that
is
a
very
significant
difference.
the
critical
point
as
well
for
purposes
of--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--ah,
those
are
not,
but
the
example
that
i
gave
to
justice
kennedy
would
be,
which
is
that
there
are
outside
buyers
who
do
receive
commissions.
and
remember,
of
course,
that
there
are
outside
salesmen
who
do
not
receive
commissions
but
are
nonetheless
exempt.
congress
didn't
write
an
exemption
about
commissions;
it
wrote
them
about
whether
it's
an
outside
person
who
engages
in
sales.
and
the
other
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
--
and
justice
scalia
echoed
it
to
some
extent
--
and
that
is
that
the
flsa
draws
very
fine
lines.
if
you
work
for
a
movie
theater
you
are
exempt,
but
not
a
playhouse.
if
you
work
for
a
small
newspaper
but
not
a
small
magazine,
you
are
exempt.
if
you
care
for
the
elderly
but
not
the
young,
you
are
exempt.
and
what
congress
said
is
that
there
has
to
be
--
you
are
an
outside
salesman.
and
that,
it
is
true
that
this
is
a
peculiar
industry,
but
the
peculiarity
of
it
is
that
you
don't
make
sales.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
three
quick
points.
first,
if
you
read
the
transcript,
you
will
see
that
my
friend
says
that
the
nature
of
this
job
has
changed.
and
that
is
an
essential
part
of
understanding
this
case.
and
there
is
an
entire
amicus
brief
in
addition
to
our
submission
on
behalf
of
pharmaceutical
representatives,
which
explains
how
very
much
the
requirements
of
pharmaceutical
detailers
and
the
restrictions
on
them
have
changed
dramatically
over
the
last
couple
of
decades
in
particular.
and
that's
why
the
continued
references
to
years
are
wrong.
the
other
important
part
about
the
flsa
in
particular
is
that
there
is
a
statute
on
this
issue,
and
it
says
that
an
employer
can
request
guidance
from
the
agency;
and
if
it
doesn't
do
that,
it
is
not
--
it
has
no
defense.
its
job
is
to
ask
for
guidance.
and
there
are
50
different
exemptions
from
the
flsa
that
cover
hundreds
of
different
categories
of
employees.
and
if
the
rule
you
are
going
to
announce
--
because
mr.
clement's
view
is
you
shouldn't
be
bound
by
any
precedent,
if
the
rule
you
are
going
to
now
announce
is
that
there
has
to
be
rulemaking
with
respect
to
all
of
those,
it's
going
to
be
an
administrative
nightmare.
two
quick
further
points.
the
department
of
labor's
position
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
actual
commitment,
not
a
precatory
commitment.
and
mr.
clement
says,
well,
that's
contrary
to
the
definition
of
3(k).
please
read
the
definition
again,
and
if
you
find
something
in
there,
something
that
is
not
a
commitment
--
it
can
be
an
exchange;
it
can
be
a
commitment
that
is
even
a
consignment;
it
can
be
a
traditional
sale.
every
one
of
those
things
is
commitment.
it
is
impossible
to
find
in
the
definition
of
commitment
a
rule
that
says
--
excuse
me,
in
the
definition
of
sale--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there
are
two
different
parts
to
it.
one
is
that
they
--
as
explained
by
mr.
stewart,
their
view
of
transfer
of
title,
but
the
weiss
report
says
repeatedly
that
there
has
to
be
a
commitment
to
buy.
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
have
to
agree--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
have
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
the
agreement
to
transfer
title.
there
are
two
parts
to
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but
there
has
to
be
the
agreement,
a
firm
agreement.
it's
repeated
in
the
2004
preamble
to
the
regulations
as
well.
now,
the
last
critical
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
mr.
clement
says
there
are
commissions
on
sales
in
the
sales
territory.
and
what
he
is
not
talking
about
is
any
commitment
by
a
physician.
when
you
look
at
the
transcript
and
he
talks
about
sales
in
the
sales
territory,
he
is
talking
about
the
sales
by
the
pharmacy.
that's
where
the
sale
occurs
in
this
industry.
it's
to
the
wholesaler
and
to
the
pharmacy
and
to
the
customer.
he
is
not
talking
about
a
sale
in
the
sense
of
getting
a
commitment
to
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
--
mr.
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
fairly
describe
that
as
a
finding
of
fact.
that
is
the
judge
--
his
view
of
the
summary
judgment
record.
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--two
--
two
things
about
that.
first
is
that
a
detailer
doesn't
get
a
commitment
to
a
prescription.
and
then
in
addition,
it's
clear
that
there
are
numerous
influences
on
what
a
doctor
does.
there's
all
the
advertising--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
an
important
point.
it
is
a
different
point.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
the
point
that
i
will
make
at
bottom
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
firm
commitment.
that's
what
the
department
says.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
definition
in
3(k)
that
contradicts
that.
