justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
clear
on
what
the
hypothetical
is.
i
thought
her
hypothetical
--
justice
kagan's
--
was
a
situation
where
the
statute
says,
mr.
secretary,
you
can
spend
no
money
beyond
what
is
appropriated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
contract
doesn't
mention
it.
that's
ferris.
i
thought
that
the
--
the
real
world
is,
in
contracting,
you
typically
have
both
a
statute
that
says
don't
pay
more
than
is
appropriated--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
in
the
contract
it
says,
subject
to
appropriation,
putting
the
contracting
party
on
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
which
were
you
answering?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
words
in
the
contract
are
"subject
to
appropriations".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
in
that
world
--
now
we
get
to
the
question
--
in
that
world,
what
happens
when
15
people
each
enter
into
such
a
contract
for
$100,000
each,
and
the
appropriation
turns
out
to
be
too
small
to
pay
all
of
them,
but
big
enough
to
pay
some?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
saw
--
i
read
the
redbook.
i
might
have
missed
the
part
that
you're
about
to
cite
to,
because
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
where
in
the
redbook
it
says
that
a
contractor
who
has
a
contract
that
says
"subject
to
appropriations"
and
is
then
dealing
with
the
law
of
congress
which
says
the
appropriation
will
not
exceed
x
million
is
then
entitled
to
be
paid
on
a
contract
where
he
and
like
contracts
do
exceed
x
million.
where
does
is
say
that
in
the
redbook?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did
read
it.
i
just
would
like
to
know
what
page
you
want
me
to
read
again.
i
read
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief.
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief
says
everybody
knows
the
contractors
are
paid
in
this
situation.
so
i
looked
up
the
authorities
that
they
cited.
okay?
i
read
the
redbook.
i
read
my
other
case
of
cherokee.
i
read
ferris.
i
read
sutton.
i
can't
say
i'm
perfect
at
reading--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
appreciate
your
referring
me
to
those
citations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
it
in
front
of
me,
by
coincidence.
[laughter]
here
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
have
the
redbook
6-44.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
there.
i
just
read
through
these
pretty
quickly.
i
just
need
a
little
refresher.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
don't
have
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
that
isn't
quite
my
question.
my
question
was:
i
would
like
the
authority
for
the
proposition
that
when
you
have
a
set
of
contractors,
and
they
read
their
contract,
and
it
says
$4
million,
and
then
you
discover
that
the
amount
of
the
contracts
of
the
same
kind
in
this
category
are
more
than
$4
million,
i
want
to
know
where
in
the
redbook
it
says
that
they
get
paid
more
than
$4
million.
that's
all.
that's
fairly
simple.
and
if
that's
--
if
that's
normal
practice,
it
must
be
there's
a
lot
of
authority
for
it.
so
i
just
want
to
know
what
to
read.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
aren't
talking
about
there
where
it
says
specifically
in
the
contract
"subject
to
appropriations".
at
least,
i
think
they're
not.
now,
i
would
like
you
right
now
to
tell
me,
no,
you're
wrong;
it
does
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
distinguishing
sutton
from
ferris.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
trying
to
use
that
to
distinguish
sutton
from
ferris,
and
it's
filled
with,
well,
we're
not
sure
about
this
because
sutton,
which
is
brandeis,
which
comes
out
the
opposite
way,
did
have
a
line
appropriation,
and
i
thought
that
just
refers
to
the
fact
that
because
there's
a
line
appropriation
the
contractor
is
on
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
and
when
you
do
business
with
the
government
over
a
period
of
years,
and
it
says
subject
to
appropriation,
not
necessarily
you
but
your
lawyer,
who
is
a
good
lawyer,
should
look
up
and
see
what
the
appropriation
is
or
whether
it
was
made.
i
mean,
that's
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
not
as
a
matter
of
policy.
i'm
putting
it
as
a
question
because
that
was
my
first
reaction,
and
i
expect
you
to
say,
no,
justice
breyer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
wrong,
and
that
isn't
the
practice,
and
here
is
what
i
read
to
show
that
isn't
the
practice.
that's
all
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
showing
me
where
in
the
law
it
says
--
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
the
question
for
the
third
time,
but
it
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
here
sometimes
not
everyone
pays
sufficient
attention
to
these
very
clear
questions.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
--
look,
hypothetical,
four
people,
four
identical
contracts,
the
words
appear,
"subject
to
appropriation".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
each
is
for
a
million
dollars.
then
you
read
the
appropriation
that
was
later
made,
and
in
that
statute
it
says,
"we
hereby
appropriate
three
million",
and
--
it
is,
"the
payments
are
not
to
exceed
three
million.
"
okay?
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
i
want
is
the
authority
that
says
each
of
those
four
people
can
come
in
and
get
the
$1
million,
totaling
four
million.
i
want
the
authority
that
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
did
not
say
anything
about
it
in
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
there
certainly
is.
putting
in
the
words
gives
the
lawyer
notice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does?
where
do
you
get
--
i
couldn't
find
the
contract.
the
language
in
ferris
is,
"a
contractor
who
is
one
of
several
persons
to
be
paid
out
of
an
appropriation
is
not
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
its
administration.
"
true.
now,
dyk
says,
in
his
opinion,
that
one
difference
from
ferris
is
they
wrote
the
idea
into
the
contract,
saying
you're
subject
to
appropriation
to
get
--
to
make
that
lawyer
chargeable
with
knowledge.
and
the
second
thing
in
ferris
is
that
it
was
an
individual
who
went
off
on
his
own
in
the
administration
and
paid
money
that
he
shouldn't
have
paid.
it
should
have
been
over
here
for
the
contract.
in
this
case,
it
is
an
instance
where
congress
itself
required
the
money
to
be
paid,
as
it
was
paid,
and
didn't
provide
enough.
okay.
so
that's
where
i
am
with
ferris,
which
is
a
big
question
mark.
and
i
guess
you
can
talk
about
that,
but
all
i
wanted
to
know
is
what
is
well
established
in
this
field.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
write
something
that
suddenly
upsets
what
is
well
established.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
it
says
in
the
contract,
you
are
barred,
you
are
barred
from
recovering
if
we
don't
appropriate
enough
money.
should
it
say
that
wouldn't
matter?
is
that
right?
