chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-551,
salazar,
secretary
of
the
interior
v.
ramah
navajo
chapter.
mr.
freeman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
consequence
on
the
ground
is
that,
if
i'm
a
tribe
and
i
want
this
money,
and
i
figure
out
that
this
is
going
to
cost
me
$80,000--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
sign
a
contract
and
say,
this
is
going
to
cost
me
$100,000,
because
i
know
there
isn't
going
to
be
$100,000;
there
is
only
going
to
be
$80,000,
and
that's
what
i
need,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
--
well,
if
80,000
is
reasonable,
the
only
way
to
get
that
is
to
ask
for
100?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
makes
sense
if
you're
looking
at
the
reality
of
the
budgeting
process
because
in
one
case,
that
one
line
item
appears
on
the
department
of
interior
budget;
and
in
the
other
case,
it
appears
somewhere
else
in
the
judgment
fund
budget.
and
they
can
say
it's
not
our
fault.
the
judgment
fund
--
the
court
made
us
do
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
page,
for
those
of
us
who
don't
have
it
in
front
of
us?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
this
may
have
been
asked,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
--
i
understood
the
answer.
this
is
--
is
this
on
an
ongoing,
forward
looking
basis?
in
other
words,
you
enter
into
the
contracts,
and
then
you
wait
and
see
whether
there
are
appropriations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
doesn't
it
make
--
i
mean,
doesn't
the
system
that
the
government
is
operating
under
make
a
lot
of
sense?
because
let's
say
the
tribe
says,
look,
we
need
a
million
dollars.
the
secretary
agrees
to
it.
and
then
i
assume
the
two
of
them
get
together
and
say,
well,
we'll
try
to
get
the
appropriation
for
it.
you
know,
you
understand
we
may
not
get
it,
but
this
is
how
much
you
need,
we'll
go
back
and
get
it.
if
you
get
it,
that's
great;
if
you
don't,
well,
then
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you
suggesting
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you
suggesting
that
congress
has
to
go
through
each
of
those
contracts
and
say,
this
is
how
much
we
are
going
to
appropriate,
this
is
how
much?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
whether
it's
the
staff
in
congress
that's
going
to
do
it
or
the
staff
at
the
department
of
the
interior?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
congress
can
reasonably
determine
that
the
people
at
interior
know
better
about
how
to
do
it
than
we
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
freeman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
think
that
was
responsive.
does
the
secretary
--
justice
kagan
can
defend
her
own
question
--
but
does
the
secretary
have
the
discretion
to
adopt
something
other
than
a
pro
rata
distribution
when
there
are
not
sufficient
appropriations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
11-551,
salazar
versus
ramah
navajo
nation.
justice
sotomayor
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
