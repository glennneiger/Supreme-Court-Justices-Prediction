before
you
do
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
my
understanding
that
that
system,
that
has
been
described
as
arbitrary,
was
not
the
one
that
was
applicable
to
the
years
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
--
you
haven't
mentioned
it
up
till
now,
but
congress,
in
these
appropriations,
said
"not
in
excess
of".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
just
a
general
"subject
to
appropriations".
it
was
a
specific
amount,
the
secretary
shall
not
pay
in
excess
of
a
certain
dollar
amount
for
these
costs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
really--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
freeman,
where
did
these
caps
come
from?
did
the
agency
initiate
them?
or,
there
is
a
chart
--
perhaps
i
don't
understand
it
correctly.
it's
on
page
210
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
does
--
it
does
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
bia
that
proposed
the
cutbacks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can't
get
it
from
cherokee.
i
mean,
yes,
there's
ferris,
and
then
cherokee--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
relying
on
ferris;
but,
cherokee
is
very
careful
to
point
out
that
there
were
funds
to
cover--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
the
obligation
to
perform.
i
mean,
right?
in
a
term
of
the
contract,
that
if
there
are
lack
of
sufficient
appropriations,
performance
by
either
party
is
excused.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that,
yes,
the
cap
has
meaning,
because
in
order
to
exceed
the
cap,
the
tribe
has
to
sue;
so,
any
tribe
that
sues,
for
any
tribe
that
sues,
the
cap
is
meaningless?
it's
only
for
the
ones
who
are
not
sophisticated
enough
to
sue.
they
are
just
stuck
with
what
congress
said.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
very
bizarre
scheme
to
say
that;
that
you
have
a
cap,
but
the
cap
is
meaningless
if
you
bring
a
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is
whether
the
cap
was
meaningless.
and
i
think
your
answer
is,
yes,
for
anyone
who
sues,
the
cap
is
meaningless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
must
that
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
must
answer
that
question
"yes"--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
that's
exactly
what
the
secretary
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
explained
that
it
was
pro
rata.
