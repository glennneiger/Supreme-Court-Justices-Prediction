mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
guess
i'd
like
to
start
on
the
ferris
doctrine
because
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
principle
of
ferris
--
and
it's
interesting
to
me
that
counsel
for
the
government
never
once
makes
any
reference
to
the
comptroller
general's
interpretation
of
the
ferris
doctrine,
which
in
the
redbook
says,
as
plain
as
day,
that
in
circumstances
like
this
one,
where
the
government
has
more
contractors
than
it
had
--
than
one,
and
those
contractors
are
subject
to
an
appropriation,
and
it
cannot
exceed
that
appropriation
--
i
think
all
of
that
language,
frankly,
is
implied
anyway
--
the
contract--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
no.
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
"not
to
exceed"
has
a
very
significant
role
to
play,
justice
kennedy,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
place
where
"not
to
exceed",
i
think,
carries
particular
significance
is
that
in
the
ordinary
situation,
we
would
be
entitled
to
seek
injunctive
relief
to
take
money
from
other
sources
within
--
within
the
budget
and
get
an
injunction.
and
that's
very
unique
to
the
--
to
this
context.
ordinarily,
government
contractors
cannot
seek
injunctive
relief.
this
"not
to
exceed"
language--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--deprives
us
of
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
redbook
doesn't
--
well,
actually,
the
redbook
does
say
that
all
of
these
phrases
are
essentially
the
same,
which
is
that
they--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
redbook--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
redbook
talks
about
subject
to
appropriations;
it
talks
about--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--gao
redbook
6-44--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--says--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
is
in
our
brief
at
page--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
my
brief,
it's
on
page
31.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
if
you
look
at
--
i'm
sorry
--
2
gao
--
well,
i
think
you
can
use
either
of
these:
2
gao
redbook
6-28
to
--
29
talks--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--talks
about
"for"
followed
by
a
purpose
and
an
amount
has
the,
quote,
"same
effect
as"
--
quote
--
"'words
like
"not
more
than"
or
"not
to
exceed".
"
so,
i
mean,
what
they're
saying
is
that
all
of
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
2
gao
redbook
6-28
to
--
29.
and
i
think
the
same--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
here,
6-45
says,
if
a
contract
is
but
one
activity
under
a
larger
appropriation,
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
contractor
to
know
how
much
of
that
appropriation
remains
available.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
says,
if
congress
appropriates
a
specific
dollar
amount
for
a
particular
contract--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
as
a
matter
of
policy
--
you
know,
if
congress--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
clearly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
exactly
how
to
answer
that
question,
justice
breyer,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
doing
my
best,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
i
would
read
ferris.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
ferris
has
a
limitation.
the
government
has
already
told
us
that
subject
to
appropriation
is
implicit
in
every
--
in
every
agreement
anyway,
so
there's
nothing
special
about
putting
in
the
words
"subject
to
appropriation".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
again,
the
only
notice
it
gives
is
that
there
has
to
be
enough
money
when
you
look
at
the
appropriation
to
cover
your
contract.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
that's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--clearly.
and
that
--
i
mean,
and,
justice
breyer,
the
court's
opinion
in
cherokee
said
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
subject
to
availability
clause
is
to
deal
with
the
situation
where
you
enter
into
the
agreement
ahead
of
the
fiscal
year,
and
so
everybody
knows
that
if
congress,
for
whatever
reason,
decides
not
to
appropriate
any
money,
there
is
no
deal,
and
nothing
happens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
government's
problem
to
sort
it
out.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but,
again,
put
it
in
the
context,
justice
kennedy,
of
the
individual
tribe.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no
question
about
it,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
cherokee.
i
do
think
cherokee
answers
the
question
of
how
far
can
you
carry
the
"subject
to
availability"
language.
i
don't
think
it
gets
the
government
anywhere
near
home.
and
then
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
with
the
"not
to
exceed"
language.
and
i
would
suggest
there
is
that,
that's
no
different,
frankly,
from
ferris
or
any
other
situation,
because
what
the
--
congress
operates
against
the
backdrop
of
ferris,
which
is
a
120-plus-year-old
doctrine
that
has
been
allowed
to
stay
in
place
by
congress
for
that
entire
time.
and
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
tells
us,
this
is
a
rule
that
every
contractor
takes
as
an
article
of
faith
in
dealing
with
the
united
states
government.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
hard
to
make
that
argument
because
the
"not
to
exceed"
language,
at
least,
that
comes
out
of
the
--
that's
in
the
appropriations
provision.
that's
not
in
the
contract
itself.
the
contract
itself
simply
says
subject
to
appropriations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
--
ferris
doesn't
have
the
"subject
to
appropriation",
but
the
ferris
contract
says
the
appropriation
limit
is
x.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay.
well,
i
take
this,
then,
straight
from
the
red
book
again.
"it
is
settled
that
contractors
paid
from
a
general
appropriation
are
not
barred
from
recovering
for
breach
of
contract,
even
though
the
appropriation
is
exhausted.
"
and
so
even
though
--
and
there
is
nothing
in
--
there's
no
limitation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
would
say
that
if
you
don't
appropriate
enough
money
for
the
specific
contract,
yes.
i
think
that's
clearly
what
sutton
holds.
is
that
if
--
if
justice
scalia
and
i
have
an
agreement,
and
the
appropriation
goes
to
$100
for
our
agreement,
and
the
contract
says
$500,
i'm
out
of
luck
for
the
extra
$400.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because,
essentially,
what
you're
doing
is
putting
the
backs
of
this
problem
--
putting
the
burden
of
this
problem
on
the
backs
of
innocent
contractors
who--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--who
entered
into
in
good
faith
these
agreements.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
a
couple
things
about
that.
i
mean,
i
think
in
general
it's
reasonable
to
look
for
the
--
obviously,
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
the
expectations
of
the
parties.
this
case
went
off
on
summary
judgment
that
we
lost,
i
mean,
even
on
a
--
so
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
for
any
analysis
of
this.
but
the
reality
is,
is
that
from
the
tribe's
perspective,
they
recognize,
because
of
ferris,
and
because
of
the
way
the
comptroller
general
has
interpreted
ferris,
that
they
are
under
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
there
is
an
appropriation
that
covers
this
contract,
that
the
amount,
purpose,
time
requirements
are
all
satisfied
with
enough
money
to
accomplish
that.
and
then,
of
course,
we
have
the
obligation
to
perform,
which,
of
course,
that's
the
other
half
of
the
equation
here.
and,
justice
sotomayor,
that's
why
i
wouldn't
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
--
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
problem
is,
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
until
after
the
year
of
performance
is
done,
or
at
least
months
into
the
performance.
and
sometimes,
literally,
after
we've
already
performed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
that
is
the
southern
ute
case.
and
i
--
and,
certainly,
you
can
make
an
argument
to
that.
the
government
has
an
argument
on
the
other
side.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
argument
is,
it
appears
that
congress
intended
to
require
them
to
enter
into
that
agreement.
you
know,
the
idea
of
congress
requiring
an
official
to
enter
into
an
agreement
that
violates
a
criminal
statute
is
at
least
a
difficult
concept
to
sort
of
wrap
your
mind
around.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
justice
kennedy.
i
told
you
what
the
meaning
of
the
"not
to
exceed"
language
is.
the
bia
or
anyone
else
at
the
interior
and
say,
give
us
money
from
another
source
in
order
to
pay
for
our
contract.
and
we
can't
use
the
injunctive
relief
that's
otherwise
available
to
us
for
that
purpose.
so
that
language
has
very
significant
importance
in
limiting
what
our
options
are--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
a
circumstance
where
we
are
not
being
paid
enough
under
the
--
the
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
--
i
mean,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can't
--
i
mean,
aside
from
bringing
a
lawsuit,
i
mean,
we
--
we
could
go
to
the
secretary
and
say,
we
don't
have
enough
money
to
satisfy
our
contract,
would
you
take
money
from
some
other
source
in
order
to
accomplish
that.
because,
in
the
ordinary
course,
that's
not
uncommon
to
re
--
re-jigger
the
appropriation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
--
yes,
there
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
that
would
not
make
our
situation
any
better,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
no.
it
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
does
that.
it
--
it
--
it
places
inherent
limitations
--
i
mean,
it
says
specifically
that
the
secretary
is
not
authorized
to
shift
money
around
in
order
to
take
care
of
this
particular
problem
in
this
particular
year
that
otherwise
would
be
available
to
us.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
course.
then,
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
ultimately,
it
means
that
the
burden
of
it
will
not
fall
on
the
tribes.
it
is
--
it
does
mean
that.
but
--
and
let's
be
clear
about
this.
the
judgment
fund
--
this
is
not
simply
going
to
the
judgment
fund
and
asking
for
our
contract
support
costs
to
be
paid.
our
argument
here
is
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
contract,
and
we
are
entitled
to
the
damages
for
the
breach
of
contract,
whether
those
are
reliance
damages
or
restitutionary
damages,
whether
we
--
whether
we
are
supposed
to
get
what
we
expected
out
of
the
deal
or
put
back
in
the
position
we
would
have
been
in.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
easy
way
would
be
to
impose
specific
limitations
in
--
in
every
one
of
the
contracts,
which
--
which,
frankly,
if
you
read
appropriations
bills,
which
i
hate
to
say
i
have
occasionally
done--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
would
look
like
--
for
the
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
ramah
navajo
for
--
for
contract
support
costs
in
this
particular
--
for
taking
over
the
police
department,
the
contract
support
costs
shall
not
exceed
$150,000,
period.
that's
the
total
appropriation.
and
if
we
look
at
our
contract
--
and
there
is
a
specific
number
in
the
contract
--
and
that
contract
says
$174,000,
then
we
know
that
we
are
out
of
luck
for
the
$24,000.
we've
been
put
on
specific
notice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--what's
that,
justice
alito?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah,
nothing
is
all
that
easy,
obviously.
some
of
them
enter
into
it
on
a
fiscal
year
basis.
some
of
them
enter
into
it
on
a
--
on
a
--
on
a
calendar
year
basis.
and,
frankly,
the
--
part
of
the
problem
is
when
does
the
government
get
around
to
signing
these
agreements.
and,
also,
there
are
12
regions.
i
mean,
part
of
the
reason
--
i
would
like
to
spend
a
second
talking
about
the
comment
that,
you
know,
we
have
this
fair
and
equitable
scheme
in
place
in
which
we
are
allocating
moneys
out,
when
the
reality
is,
is
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record,
even
though
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
full
record,
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
bureau
makes
mistakes
in
40
percent
of
these
contractual
arrangements.
and
i
know
my
--
my
colleague
is
going
to
dispute
that,
but
the
truth
is
we've
known
that
for
years.
they
just
make
mistakes,
and
people
get
impaired
--
their
contract
rights
are
impaired
on
that
basis.
this
is
not
some
kind
of
an
inequitable
scheme
that's
operating
here.
there
are
12
different
regions
operating
in
12
different
ways.
some
people
get
money,
some
people
get
300
percent
of
theirs,
some
people
get
zero
percent
of
theirs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
the
easy
way
would
be
to
take
away
the
requirement
that
the
government
has
to
enter
into
all
of
these
contracts
at
the
request
of
the
tribe.
and
--
and
--
and
that's
clearly
available.
if
they
want
to
go
down
that
path,
they
can
do
that
in
a
heartbeat.
and
then
they
have
all
of
the
discretion
they
want
--
they
want
to
apply
under
these
circumstances.
so,
i
mean,
there's
--
obviously,
there
is
a
bit
of,
as
we
said
in
the
brief,
schizophrenia.
and
i
have
some
misgivings
about
describing
congress
that
way,
but
there
is
some
schizophrenia
in
how
they
approach
this
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
congress
could--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
i
--
i
mean,
i
think
that
would--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
just
think
it's
been
noted--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
you
know,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
look,
and
as
we
argued
in
our
brief,
there
are
three
or
four
different
ways
that
congress
can
fix
this
problem
going
forward,
but
--
and
that's
--
and
that's
the
message,
i
thought,
from
justice
sotomayor,
is
why
don't
we
let
congress
fix
the
problem
and
allow
the
background
principles
of
ferris,
as
interpreted
by
the
comptroller
general,
to
apply
in
this
case
in
order
to
resolve
the
contract
dispute
that's
properly,
obviously,
before
the
court
at
this
point.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
typically,
what
happens
is
you
enter
into
the
agreement
sometime
just
before
the
appropriation
comes
down.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
usually
pretty
close,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
--
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
did
that
on
a
--
on
a
tribe-by-tribe,
contract-by-contract
basis,
i
--
i
wouldn't
have
any
problem
with
that,
because
then
you're
on
notice.
but
when
they
say
to
you,
okay,
fine,
here's
--
you
know,
this
is
--
there
is
your
contract
support
cost
provision,
there
is
a
specific
number
in
there,
1.3.78
dollars
and
63
cents,
that's
what
you
ought
to
get,
and
we
get
an
appropriation
that
comes
back
in
that
says
the
government
will
--
that,
you
know,
we
have
appropriated
$100
million
for
contract
support
costs.
there
are
330
other
tribes
out
there
potentially
with
contracts
that
are
involved
here.
it
is
--
and
--
and
just
to
put
it
in
context,
we
are
talking
about
--
you
know,
many
of
these
tribes
are
in
incredibly
remote
situations.
they
don't
have
access
to
all
the
other
information
about
what's
going
on.
and
the
real
question
is,
should
you
impose--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
on
the
tribes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
--
i
actually
think
that
would
be
the
fairer
way
to
do
it.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
as
burdensome
as
--
as
your
question
implies
because,
again,
what
else
does
staff
have
better
to
do
than
to
sit
down
and
put
all
those
appropriations
together.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
then
--
then
they
could
do
it
by
--
by
--
expressly
by
reference.
i
mean,
if,
in
fact,
interior
has
set
it
out
that
way
and
has
it
all
done,
then
they
can
just
incorporate
it
into
the
statute
anyway.
i
mean,
there
are
simple
ways
to
do
it.
there
are
broader
ways
to
do
it.
and
as
i
said
to
justice
sotomayor,
clearly
congress
could
simply,
you
know,
absolve
the
government
of
its
responsibility
to
enter
into
any
contract
that
a
--
that
a
--
when
an
indian
tribe
shows
up
at
their
doorstep.
all
of
those
seem
to
me
preferable
than
saying
to
the
tribes,
after
they
have
fully
performed
their
side
of
the
deal,
okay,
i'm
sorry,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
you.
the
--
the
other
thing
that's
odd
about
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
at
the
beginning
of
performance.
but
--
but
what
we
find
out
about
the
notices
that
we
are
--
that
we've
later
received
is
at
some
point,
we're
sending
you
75
percent
in
some
situations,
or
we're
going
to
send
you
exactly
the
same
amount
of
money
you
got
last
year,
even
though
that
won't
cover
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
we
haven't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--exactly.
and,
candidly,
assume
that
--
either
one
of
two
things
will
happen.
either
we
will
ultimately
be
paid
in
full,
which
has
happened
--
i
mean,
the
last
year,
they
were
in
fact
paid
in
full.
or
alternatively,
that
they
will
have
access
to
the
judgment
fund
in
order
to
--
to
get
the
recovery
they
are
otherwise
entitled
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
question
is
it's
unclear
what
congress
really
wanted
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
you
ought
to
construe
the
--
the
scheme
in
a
way
that
is
most
favorable
to
the
tribes.
and
if
that
means
that
the
scheme
operates
so
as
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
appropriations
process
and
the
spending
process
for
a
particular
year,
and
prevents
us
from
being
able
to
seek
relief
outside
of
this
contract
support
cost
appropriation
limitation,
that
makes
perfect
sense
to
me,
leaving
open
obviously
the
availability
of
the
judgment
fund
at
the
end
of
the
day
so
that
the
tribes
do
not
in
fact
have
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
--
of
this
arrangement
as
opposed
to
--
as
opposed
to
anyone
else.
i
mean,
that's
--
again,
we
do
provide
--
we've
performed
the
services.
we
don't
know.
we
do
it
in
good
faith.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
classic
situation
in
which
we
should
receive
full
compensation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
thank
you.
