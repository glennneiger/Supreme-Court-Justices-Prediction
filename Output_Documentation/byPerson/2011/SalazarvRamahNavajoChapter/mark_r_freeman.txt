mr.
mark
r.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
funding
dispute
in
the
--
in
this
case
is
the
result
of
two
distinctive
features
of
the
isda's
statutory
scheme.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
has
required
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
accept
every
self-determination
contract
proposed
by
an
indian
tribe,
provided
that
the
contract
meets
the
requirements
of
the
act,
without
regard
to
the
total
number
of
contracts
into
which
the
secretary
must
enter.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
in
every
fiscal
year
since
1994,
congress
has
enacted
an
explicit
statutory
cap
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
secretary
may
use
to
pay
contract
support
costs
under
the
isda
and
under
those
contracts.
now,
we
think
under
the
circumstances,
congress
intended
the
secretary
to
resolve
these
--
the
relationship
between
these
provisions
in
exactly
the
way
that
the
secretary
has.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
i'm
sorry.
i
couldn't
hear
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes,
your
honor.
well,
the
secretary
has
promulgated
a
formal
nationwide
policy.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes,
and--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--right.
and
let
me
address
that.
the
allegation
is,
i
think,
at
page
9
to
10
of
respondents'
brief.
those
allegations
are,
as
a
factual
matter,
false.
for
example,
they've
given
a
couple
of
examples
where
0
percent
contract
support
costs
were
paid.
one
of
those
examples
is
a
contract
where
it
had
been
entered
into
in
that
particular
year.
new
contracts
are
paid
under
a
different
appropriation.
another
example
is
they
give
a
case
of
a
tribe
that
was
paid
352
percent
of
its
contract
support
costs.
and
let
me
explain,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
how--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
that's
right.
at
--
at
the
time
of
the
district
court's
ruling
in
this
case,
from
1994
to
about
2006,
the
secretary
followed
a
uniform
pro
rata
distribution
methodology
according
to
the
needs
of
each
of
the
individual
tribes.
now,
that's
what
we
thought
the
tribes
wanted.
we
thought
that
was
the
fairest
way
to
do
it.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
yes.
so
each
tribe
has
an
amount
of
need.
this
is
the
amount
that
is
estimated.
it's
a
negotiated
figure
between
the
secretary
and
each
tribe.
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
amounts
that
congress
has
been
--
has
appropriated
have
never
been
enough
to
pay
100
percent
of
each
of
those
figures
for
each
member
of
the
respondent
class.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
have
similar
language
in
cherokee,
if
you
mean
the
appropriations
act.
it
was
under
the
same--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--that's
right.
and
maybe
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well
--
i
may
not
be
understanding
your
honor's
question,
but
i
--
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
explain
what
was
at
issue
in
cherokee.
in
cherokee,
the
government
was
not
in
this
court
making
appropriations
clause
arguments.
we
were
here
making
a
very
different
argument.
it
was
undisputed
in
cherokee
that
congress
had
appropriated
enough
money
for
the
unobligated
available
funds,
lawfully
available
funds,
for
the
secretary
to
pay
all
of
the
contracts
that
were
at
issue.
our
argument
--
and
to
be
sure,
we
thought
we
were
right
--
our
argument
was
that
congress
had
in
other
provisions
of
the
act
allowed
us
to
set
aside
a
certain
amount
of
money
that,
albeit
lawfully
available
to
pay
the
contracts,
we
thought
we
could
use
to
fund
the
agency's
inherent
federal
operations.
and
the
court
said:
no,
no,
no.
these
are
contracts.
the
money
was
lawfully
available
for
you
to
pay,
and
there
was
no
statutory
restriction
against
you
paying
it,
so
you
had
to
pay
it.
and
this
case
involves
the
circumstance
that--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no.
i
think
that's
not
quite
an
accurate
characterization
of
ferris.
and
it's
important
to
understand
what
ferris--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--ferris
was
an
appropriation
for
--
i
think
it
was
40-some
thousand
dollars
for
improvements
to
the
delaware
river.
and
the
government,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
let
out
a
contract
for
$37,000
to
dredge
the
river.
then
after
the
contract
had
been
let
out
--
and
this
is
critical.
if
you
stop
the
movie
at
the
time
the
contract
was
issued,
there
was
sufficient
funds
to
pay
that
contract.
they
were
lawfully
available.
we
obligated
them
to
the
--
to
the
contractor.
and
then
what
happened
in
ferris
was,
after
that
lawful
binding
agreement
was
entered,
agency
officials
decided
in
their
discretion
that
they'd
prefer
not
to
spend
the
money
on
that,
and
they
instead
built
a
wharf
or
something.
and
what
the
court
said
in
ferris
--
and
this
is
--
we're
not
--
we
have
no
quarrel
with
this
principle
--
is
that
when
the
funds
are
lawfully
available
and
you
obligate
them
to
a
contractor
without
some
contingency,
then
you
can't
just
decide
to
spend
it
on
something
else.
that's
a
breach.
and
it's
not
a
defense
to
the
breach
that
at
the
end
of
the
--
that
at
the
end,
once
you've
breached
the
contract,
there
isn't
enough
money
left
in
the
appropriation
to
go
back
and
pay
them
what
you
should
have.
that's
different
from
this
case,
that
there
is
not
enough
lawfully
available
money
to
pay
every--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--your
honor,
i
think
ferris
is
correctly
understood
--
particularly
given
this
court's
subsequent
decisions
in
sutton,
in
bradley,
leiter,
and
other
cases,
ferris
is
correctly
understood
as
saying
--
and
this
is
the
proposition,
incidentally,
for
which
the
court's
cited
ferris
in
cherokee.
ferris
is
understood
as
saying
if
you've
got
a
binding
obligation
in
which
you
promised
to
pay
money
that
is
lawfully
available,
congress
gave
it
to
you,
then
if
you,
agency
officials,
do
something
in
your
executive
discretion--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well,
in
ferris,
there
were
--
in
fact,
the
contract
was
not
made
subject
to
appropriations.
and
one
of
the
things
the
federal
circuit
pointed
out
was
that
the
"subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
"
language
that
is
now
ubiquitous
in
government
contracts
was
developed
in
part
to
make
sure
that
the
ferris
situation
didn't
later
arise.
but
i
want
to
underscore,
if
we
know
one
thing
in
this
case,
we
know
that
congress
intended
for
the
secretary
not
to
pay
any
more
than
the
amounts
in
the
statutory
caps.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
i
--
your
honor,
it's
going
to
depend
on
a
couple
of
things.
and
let
me
--
let
me
explain.
i
think,
because
by
hypothesis
in
your
hypothetical
we're
entering
into
the
contracts
in
advance
of
appropriations,
there
is
no
right
to
be
paid
until
the
appropriations
are
made.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
agency
cannot
pay
more
than
$9
million,
and
there
is
no
binding
obligation,
contractual
obligation,
on
the
government
to
pay
more.
let
me
add
something,
though,
in
response--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--and,
your
honor,
the
reason
why
this
is
not
a
problem
in
real
life
is
that
there
are
other
provisions
in
your
ordinary
procurement
contracts,
under
the
ordinary
kind
of
contracts
that
this
case
is
not,
that
take
care
of
that.
and
the
principal
one
is--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no.
your
honor,
it
--
there
are
a
couple
of
things
there.
but
let
me
first
explain
why
as
a
practical
matter
that
doesn't
happen
in
circumstances
that
are
--
are
not
like
this
scheme
where
we're
required
to
enter
into
every
contract.
in
your
ordinary
government
procurement
scheme,
there
are
termination
for
convenience
provisions.
and,
in
fact,
what
happens
in
the
circumstances
in
which
your
honor
posits
is
the
government
terminates
for
convenience
enough
of
the
contracts
to
make
sure
that
we
have
the
money
to
pay.
and
if
we
didn't
do
that,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
anti-deficiency
act.
and
this
court
has
said
many
times--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
well--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well,
they
do
know.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no
--
no,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
not
correct,
and
let
me
explain
why.
first,
every
contract
that
the
--
every
member
of
the
respondent
class
signed
in
this
case
says
that
the
contractor's
obligation
to
perform
the
services
that
are
at
issue
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriated
funds.
that's
section
(1)(c)(iii)
of
the
model
agreement
that
is
read
into
every
isda
contract.
they
further
have
the
availability
under
section
(1)(b)(v)
of
that
model
agreement
to
stop
at
any
point
if
they
are
worried
that
there's
not
going
to
be
enough
money
and
seek
assurances
from
the
secretary
that
there
will
be.
now,
as
to
whether
they
know
and
when
they
know
how
much
money
they
are
going
to
get,
that
was
the
point
of
the
2006
distribution
policy
that
the
secretary
adopted.
under
the
pro-rata
system
that
we
used
for
the
first
many
years,
the
tribes
said,
look,
we
don't
know
how
pro-rata
is
going
to
work
out.
so,
in
consultation
with
the
tribes,
and,
indeed,
with
the
aid
of
several
of
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
class,
we
drafted
a
policy
that--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no.
no,
your
honor.
and
this
is
my--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well,
i
think
they
were
citing
a
number
of
different
statutes
in
which
the
statutes
provide
that
funding
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
now,
it's
important
to
underscore,
that's
why
i
started
with
this
point,
i
don't
believe
in
any
of
those
statutory
schemes
is
the
government
obligated
to
enter
into
every
contract
that
comes
in
the
door.
and--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
and,
your
honor,
it
is
--
the
unique
features
of
this
statutory
scheme
are
absolutely
important,
but
i
want
to
--
i
took
your
honor's
question
to
be
under
the
general
appropriations
principles
that
we
are
describing,
what
would
the
result
be?
and
i
think
i'm
right,
but
i
should
also
add,
as
i
said
before,
there
are
very
strict
fiscal
controls
in
31
u.s.c.
1501,
et
sequitur,
that
make
clear
and
prevent
the
circumstance
that
your
honor
describes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
that's
right.
and
--
and--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--i
--
with
respect
to
justice
kagan,
i
believe
we
had
a
colloquy
in
which
i
said
that
because
in
her
hypothetical
we
were
entering
into
the
contract
in
advance
of
appropriations,
they
would
have
to
be
made
express
--
the
contracts
themselves
would
have
to
be
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations
in
the
contracts.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes.
and
without
that,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antideficiency
act--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
and,
your
honor,
what
i
was
trying
to
answer
is
that,
in
your
ordinary
contractual
scheme,
the
government
solves
that
problem
in
a
very
straightforward
way.
we
terminate
for
convenience
the
contracts
--
enough
of
those
contracts
to
ensure
that
we
have
no
obligations
beyond
the
available
appropriations.
now,
we
can't
do
that
here,
which
is
why
this
is
ultimately
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
your--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
--
and
maybe
it
would
help
if
i
took
a
minute
to
explain
this
--
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
this
statutory
scheme.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no.
look,
congress
could--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--not
with
--
yes.
but
450j-1(b)
says,
notwithstanding
any
provision
of
this
act,
all
funding
under
this
act
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
and
let
me
explain
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
enact
this
statute
that
has
some
unusual
features.
congress,
of
course,
could
have
said,
we
want
to
give
every
tribe
the
opportunity
to
enter
--
to
provide
services
in
its
own
name
to
its
own
people,
but
we
are
going
to
do
this
on
a
regular
contract
basis,
meaning
we'll
just
give
us
--
some
to
the
secretary.
the
secretary
signs
contracts
as
they
come
in
until
he
doesn't
have
any
money
left.
and
then
any
tribe
after
that
who
asks
for
a
--
for
a
contract,
the
secretary
says
no,
we
don't
have
the
money
to
do
it.
but
congress
chose
a
--
a
different
approach.
congress
wanted,
as
a
matter
of
self-determination,
to
require
the
secretary
to
give
every
tribe
who
wants
the
ability
to
do
this
the
opportunity
to
do
it.
but,
if
it
didn't
then
say,
all
funding
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations,
the
result
would
be
that
the
government
would
be
exposed
to
a
liability
that
congress
could
not
estimate,
because
the
ability
of
these
tribes
to
pay
for
overhead
costs
and
whatever
varies
tremendously
from
tribe--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
[laughter]
that
would
be
it.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
mean
--
and
what
i
--
what
i
tried
to
answer
to
a
question
earlier,
it
is
absolutely
clear
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here.
congress
said
not
to
exceed
a
specific
sum
from
year
to
year--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--oh,
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no
difference
at
all.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes,
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
well,
in
fact,
it
can't
work
that
way,
your
honor,
because
the
amounts
are
limited
by
statute
to
the
reasonable
and
allowable
costs
that
are
not
duplicative
of
the
principal
program
funds,
the
funds
to
run
the
program--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--right.
and
if
a
tribe
thinks
that
we
haven't
put
in
to
the
--
we
haven't
offered
them
enough
money
for
their
contract
support
costs,
they
are
allowed
to
decline
the
offer
that
we
make.
and
they
can
--
unusually,
for
government
contractors,
they
can
file
a
separate
lawsuit
before
entering
into
the
contract
to
litigate
whether
the
terms
are
sufficient.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
the
caps
come
from
congress,
your
honor.
respondents
have
make
--
have
made
an
argument
at
the
end
of
their
brief
that
the
government
should
be
liable
here
notwithstanding
the
caps
because
the
bia
hasn't
requested
sufficient
funding
from
congress
--
or,
rather,
the
president
hasn't
requested
sufficient
funding
from
congress.
that
argument,
we
think,
is
baseless
for
a
number
of
reasons.
and
just
as
a
factual
matter,
the
gao
has
done
some
studies
of
this.
there
are
reports
in
the
joint
appendix
explaining
why
bia
has
not
in
every
year
asked
for
what
turned
out
to
be
enough
money.
and
that's
because
these
--
this
funding
is
done
on
a
prospective
estimated
basis.
and
because
we
are
required
to
take
into
--
we
are
required
to
accept
every
contract
that
comes
in
the
door,
bia
may
estimate
and
make
its
best
available
estimate,
and
omb
and
the
president
may
accept
that
if
he
chooses,
but
it
still
turn
may
turn
out
not
to
be
enough.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
relevant,
your
honor.
no.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
i
don't
think
in
that
circumstance
there
would
be
any
difference.
here,
the
reason
why
it's
different
is
that
this
is
ultimately
a
question
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
there
is
no
constitutional
argument
that
congress
can't
enact
these
kind
of
caps,
and
we
know
from
the
"not
to
exceed"
language
that
congress
was
being
as
emphatic
as
it
could.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
and
just
--
it's
just
this
is
the
way,
as
an
ordinary
matter,
that
in
appropriations
congress
expresses
an
internal
cap.
it
said--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--your
honor,
ferris
we
think
is
inapplicable
just
to
this
type
of
statutory
scheme
where
we're
required
to
enter
into
the
contracts,
and
there's
a
limited
sum
available.
that's
judge
dyk's
reasoning
in
the
federal
circuit,
but
let
me
put
that
aside
for
the
moment
and
address
ferris
directly.
as
i
said
before,
ferris
is
about
the
circumstance
in
which
there
are
enough
available
funds
in
the
first
instance
to
pay
the
contractual
obligations.
now,
ferris
does
not
and
cannot
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
executive
officer
looking
at
the
amount
congress
made
available
in
the
first
instance
can
bind
the
treasury
to
pay
more
than
congress
has
expressly
stated
he
may
bind
it
to.
this
court
has
said
many,
many
times--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--right.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
contemplated
such
a
scheme,
which
would
amount
to
essentially
giving
full
contract
support
cost
funding,
but
only
for
the
tribes
who
have
the
resources
and
sophistication
to
sue,
minus
litigation
costs.
that
makes
no
sense
at
all.
when
congress
says
"not
to
exceed",
a
certain
amount
of
money
may
come
out
of
the
treasury--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
judgment
fund
is
not
a
new
thing.
the
judgment
fund
is
available
only
to
pay
judgments
validly
entered
against
the
united
states.
now,
we
don't
dispute
that
it's
available
to
pay
breach
of
contract
damages;
but,
of
course,
a
breach
of
contract
requires
a
violation
of
--
a
violation,
a
failure
to
perform
a
binding
contractual
promise.
now,
we
think
we've
performed
our
promise
here
because
our
--
our
promise
was
to
pay
the
sums
that
congress
made
lawfully
available.
and
we
think
that,
to
the
extent
respondents
think
we
promised
to
pay
more
than
congress
explicitly
said
could
be
available,
the
secretary
had
no
authority
to
enter
into
that
promise.
now--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
and,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no,
no--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--no.
that
is
emphatically
not
true.
as
--
as
an
initial
matter,
as
i've
tried
to
explain
before,
there
are
very
strict
requirements
in
the
government's
contracting
processes,
such
as
the
federal
acquisition
regulation,
that
limit
the
ability
of
the
government
to
make
many
promises
it
can't
keep,
particularly
with
regard
to
funding.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
no.
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i'll
answer
this,
and
then
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
the
isda
says
our
promise
is
to
pay
you
what
congress
lets
us
pay
you.
it's
not
breaking
our
promise
to
limit
it
to
appropriation;
it
is
keeping
our
promise.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
well,
it's
not
that
it's
ignored,
it's
that
section
450j-1(b)
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
act,
and
we
think
that's
fairly
clear.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
thank
you--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--in
part,
your
honor.
let
me
explain.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
for
the
first
many
years
in
this
scheme,
we
did
a
uniform
pro
rata
distribution
methodology.
the
tribes
came
to
us
and
said,
look,
that's
a
problem
for
us
because
we
don't
have
any
budget
transparency;
we
can't
see
how
much
we're
going
to
get.
so
we
adopted
this
policy
in
2006.
and
one
of
the
principal
elements
of
that
policy
is
that
it
guarantees
that,
if
--
as
long
as
congress
appropriates
as
much
money
as
it
did
in
the
previous
fiscal
year,
which
it
generally
has,
the
tribe
will
get
immediately,
like
within
2
weeks,
the
exact
amount
of
money
that
it
received
in
the
previous
year.
and
that
money
comes
immediately.
they
can
use
it
however
they
want.
it's
not
subject
to
apportionment.
unlike
most
federal
agencies,
we
don't
dole
it
out.
they
get
it
right
away.
now,
the
question
then
becomes
what
to
do
with
any
additional
money
that
congress
has
appropriated,
and
the
policy
provides
for
distribution
of
that
money
on
what
we
call
a
bottoms-up
basis.
we
give
it
to
the
tribes
that
are
the
farthest
away
from
100
percent
of
funding.
that
resolution
was
negotiated
with
the
tribes
and,
indeed,
with
some
counsel
for
respondents.
it's,
we
think
--
and
i
might
be
wrong
about
this
--
but
we
think
that
that's
the
solution
that
the
tribes
want,
if
the
caps
have
any
effect.
there
are--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
well,
first
of
all,
let's
make
clear
--
let's
make
sure
that
we're
not--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--well,
they
have
a
right,
your
honor,
in
the
first
instance
to
the
principal
promise
that's
under
any
isda
contract,
which
is
we
give
the
amount
of
money
that
the
secretary
would
have
provided
for
the
program
funds,
for
operational--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--contract
support
costs.
they
have
a
right
as
a
class
to
the
distribution
of
every
dollar
that
congress
appropriates,
and
for
every
contractor--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--a
proportionate
share
based
on
the
secretary's
policy
for
the
distribution
of
these
in
light
of
the
caps.
let
me--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--we
think
that--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--we
think
there's
a
contractual
right
to
--
and,
in
fact,
the
contracts
often
reference
these
policies
directly.
for
example,
page
123
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
of
the
contracts
in
this
case
says
you'll
be
paid
according
to
the
distribution
policies
adopted
by
the
secretary.
so
in
that
case,
yes,
we
bound
ourselves--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--we
think
within
a
range
of
reasonable
solutions
after
consultation
with
the
tribes,
yes.
we
don't--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--yes.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
that's
right.
and--
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
--respectfully
--
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
is
an
exaggeration.
congress
has
appropriated
since
1994
more
than
$2.3
billion
in
contract
support
cost
funds.
we've
distributed
all
of
that
money
to
the
tribes.
all
of
the
tribes
here
have
gotten
substantial
sums.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
right.
mr.
mark
r.
freeman
may
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
your
honor,
once
it
is
clear
the
caps
control
the
total
amount
of
money
that
the
secretary
may
spend,
every
further
question
is
a
question
of
allocation.
we
think
we
have
the
policy
that's
right
--
it
was
negotiated
with
the
tribes
and
counsel
for
respondents
--
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that,
we
can
have
that
fight
another
day.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
caps
define
the
maximum
amount
of
money
that
the
secretary
may
spend,
and
we
think
they
do.
