mr.
freeman,
could
i
try
a
hypothetical
on
you?
and
it's
--
it
really
is
going
to
this
question
of
what
ferris
means.
so
suppose
that
there's
a
government
program,
and
it's
to
purchase
airplanes.
and
it's
--
the
authorization
language
says
this
is
subject
to
appropriations,
in
the
same
way
that
this
language
does.
and
the
government,
under
this
program,
enters
into
10
contracts
of
a
million
dollars
each
to
buy
10
airplanes.
but
then
it
turns
out
that
congress
appropriates
only
$9
million,
not
$10
million.
so
my
question
is:
now
there
are
10
contractors
and
--
but
there's
a
shortfall
of
a
million
dollars--
justice
elena
kagan
--do
those
contractors
have
contractual
rights
under
ferris?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
so
the
appropriation
has
been
made.
it's
a
$9
million
appropriation.
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
so
either
one
of
these
airplane
manufacturers
is
going
to
not
have
what
he
contracted
for,
or
all
of
them
are
not
going
to
have
what
they
contracted
for,
because
everybody
is
going
to
--
their
contract
is
going
to
be
sliced.
justice
elena
kagan
my
understanding,
mr.
freeman,
is
that
that
is
what
ferris
said,
was
that
ferris
said
in
that
situation
where
it
turns
out
that
there's
a
shortfall
but
where
there
are
contractual
commitments,
that
--
that
the
government
is
bound
to
live
up
to
those
contractual
commitments.
and
if
there's
a
shortfall,
then
it
comes
out
of
the
judgment
fund.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
that's
partly
why
i
asked
you
my
hypothetical,
mr.
freeman,
because
i
sort
of
wanted
to
see
whether
you
would
distinguish
the
hypothetical
on
that
basis--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
you
didn't.
you
said
no,
it
doesn't
really
matter.
even
if
the
government
is
not
obligated
to
enter
into
contracts,
if
the
government
has
entered
into
too
many,
too
bad;
we
can't
make
those
additional
appropriations.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
runs
you
right
into
ferris.
then
you're
saying
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
standard
ferris-type
appropriation,
which
is
just
an
amount
of
money,
and
this
kind
of
appropriation,
which
is
up
to
or
not
to
exceed
that
amount
of
money.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
if
you
look
at
this
situation,
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
congress
did
want
to
do
something,
which
was
to
limit
the
amount
of
money
that
was
going
to
the
tribes
under
these
contracts.
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
way
that
congress
can
do
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--consistent
with
this
scheme
that's
set
up
by
the
statute?
how
could
congress
do
that?
you
know,
if
--
if
--
if
they
can't
do
it
this
way,
how
could
they?
justice
elena
kagan
when
you
say
specific
limitations,
what
would
that
look
like?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
phillips,
do
you
think
--
and
the
long
question
here
is
what
did
congress
want.
and
what
--
one
answer
might
be
congress
wanted
exactly
what
the
government
says
it
wanted.
but
another
answer
might
be
something
different,
that
actually,
congress
wanted
there
to
be
unlimited
funds
for
these
tribes,
but
that
it
wanted
to
shift
the
costs
of
some
of
those
funds
to
the
judgment
fund
outside
of
the
interior
budget.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
--
i
mean,
do
you
contest
the
government's
view
of
what
congress
wanted
here?
and
if
so,
how?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
what
i
don't
understand
about
the
government's
argument,
mr.
freeman,
is
exactly
what
the
contractual
rights
of
the
tribes
become.
i
mean,
as
i
--
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
contract,
and
we've
held
that
it's
a
contract,
and
usually
contracting
parties
have
rights
to
something.
justice
elena
kagan
so
what
do
they
have
a
right
to
in
your
view?
justice
elena
kagan
that
was
--
that
was
a
straightforward
question.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
no,
but
what
do
they
have
a
right
to
with
respect
to
these
additional
overhead
costs?
justice
elena
kagan
what
does
each
individual
tribe
have
a
right
to?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
think
they
do
have
a
right
to
a
pro
rata
share?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
the
secretary
could
not
say,
oh,
you
know,
these
tribes
have
been
doing
a
better
job,
so
we'll
give
to
them;
or
these
tribes
need
it
more,
so
we'll
give
it
to
them.
you
think
that
there's
a
contractual
right
to
a
pro
rata
share.
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
a
very
--
this
is
a
very
strange
kind
of
contractual
right.
the
--
the
contracting
tribe
has
a
right
to
have
the
secretary
to
use
discretion
to
decide
how
much
the
contracting
tribe
gets.
what
kind
of
contract
is
that?
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i'm
not
contesting
--
i
mean,
clearly
you
think
and
the
secretary
thinks
that
there's
an
obligation
to
distribute
all
that
money.
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
i
don't
think
anybody
disagrees
with
that.
the
question
is
what
each
individual
tribe
has
a
contractual
right
to.
