and
all
within
the
--
all
within
the
dollar
amount
that
was
specified
by
the
congress
in
the
"not
to
exceed"
language.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
had
exactly
the
same
question.
the
"not
to
exceed"
language,
which
i
think
is
the
word,
not
to
exceed,
hasn't
been
mentioned
by
you
yet
because
--
maybe
you
haven't
had
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
i
thought
that
was
what
judge
dyk
said--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
the
critical
--
the
difference
between
this
and
even
the
cherokee
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
my
question
is
--
is
the
same
as
justice
ginsburg's.
isn't
a
principal
part
of
your
argument
that
this
contract
said
not
to
exceed,
and
then
the
sums
differ
from
year
to
year,
but
let's
say
$95
million?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
the
congressional
budget
office,
or
whatever
agency
it
is
that
figures
out
whether
there
is
a
deficit
and,
if
so,
of
how
much,
do
they
look
at
"not
to
exceed",
and
do
they
take
that
amount
seriously?
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
--
but
the
position
of
the
respondents
is
that
it
makes
no
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
congress
is
saying
nothing
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
respondents'
position
is
that
the
contracting
officer
says,
now,
this
is
going
to
go
over
the
not-to-exceed
amount,
but
not
to
worry,
just
sue
us
under
the
judgment
--
just
sue
us
under
the
judgment
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
--
you
say
you
don't
want
us
to
mention
"not
to
exceed"
in
our
opinion--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--other
than
to
say
that
it's
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
redbook
talk
about
"not
to
exceed"
as
being
any
different
from
general
appropriations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
redbook--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
the
redbook
refer
to
"not
to
exceed"
--
the
"not
to
exceed"
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
redbook
have
--
refer
to
the
"not
to
exceed"
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
your
view,
if
the
tribe
comes
to
the
government,
and
they
say,
look,
we've
been
looking
at
what
you've
done
with
the
other
tribes,
you've
appropriated
$95
million,
and
the
appropriation
says,
"not
to
exceed
$95
million.
"
but
go
ahead
and
make
this
contract
with
us,
anyway,
no
one
cares.
and
you
say,
go
ahead
and
make
it.
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
did
know.
suppose
the
tribe
knew
that
the
95
million
--
let's
assume
that
that's
the
not
to
exceed
amount
--
had
already
been
obligated.
could
the
tribe
then
go
ahead
and
make
the
government
--
a
contract
with
the
government,
and
would
the
government
have
to
make
that
contract,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
argument
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
this
more
specific
language
than
the
general
language?
doesn't
this
specific
language,
not
to
exceed,
supersede
the
general
obligation
to
make
the
contract?
otherwise,
it's
meaningless.
the
"not
to
exceed
language"
is
meaningless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
it's
meaningless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
just
go
to
the
judgment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
just
go
to
the
judgment
fund--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
makes
it
meaningless.
