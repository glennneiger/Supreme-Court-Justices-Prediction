justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
we
have
similar
language
in
cherokee
nation?
didn't
we
say
that
that
language
in
cherokee
nation,
which
was
in
the
general
appropriations
statute
although
not
on
each
contract,
didn't
mean
the
secretary
could
refuse
to
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
mean
the
appropriations
act.
i
mean
--
i
mean
the
general
statute
that
governed
this
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
does
it
mean
one
thing
there
and
mean
something
else
when
--
in
the
appropriations
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
--
but
there
wasn't
in
ferris
either.
i
mean,
that
was
the
problem.
if
the
appropriations
had
been
enough
to
cover
that
plus
the
later
expenditures,
there
would
have
been
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
available
subject
to
appropriations.
i
mean,
it
was
subject
to
appropriations.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
really
relevant
here
anyway,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
the
language
$900,000.
you
mean
the
world
changes
if
--
if
congress,
instead
of
just
appropriating
$900,000,
authorizes
the
secretary
to
expend
not
to
exceed
$900,000?
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
--
i
think
$900,000
is
pretty
emphatic,
if
that's
all
you
appropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
would.
i've
lost
the
question.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
ferris
did
not
say,
as
i
recall,
that
you
can't
expect
the
contractor
to
have
notice
that
appropriations
have
been
limited.
it
said
you
can't
expect
them
to
have
notice
as
to
how
much
of
the
expenditures
under
that
appropriated
act
have
been
spent.
isn't
that
the
only
thing
it
required
notice
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think,
if
you
sign
a
contract,
you
better
be
sure
that
there
are
appropriations
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
am
i
correct
that
what
the
government
is
arguing
is
that
the
fact
that
this
limitation
was
included
in
the
particular
contract
makes
it
different
from
ferris?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
ferris
did
not.
did
the
ferris
contract
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
is
it
just
a
question
of
our
creating
a
new
rule;
or,
rather,
is
the
proposition
whether
the
tribes,
when
they
entered
into
this,
should
have
realized
that
because
of
the
peculiarity
of
these
contracts,
that
they
had
to
be
entered
into,
that
the
rule
which
otherwise
would
apply
does
not
apply?
it
ought
to
be
a
question
of
expectation
of
the
tribe,
should
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
it
protects
these
--
these
unsophisticated
tribes
who
don't
know
enough
to
sue
by
not
allowing
anybody
to
sue?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
make
their
situation
better
somehow?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
solve
it
contract
by
contract?
couldn't
there
be
a
--
a
provision
in
the
--
in
the
law
which
--
which
says
that,
where
appropriated
funds
are
inadequate
to
cover
the
totality
of
--
of
--
of
costs
under
this
statute,
it
will
be
apportioned
as
follows?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
secretary
will
apportion
it?
that's
all
it
would
take.
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
do
it
contract
by
contract;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
prefer
contract
by
contract
for
your
clients.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
absolutely--
