justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
but
could
the
secretary
have
done
anything
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
the
secretary
have
done
anything
else?
there's
an
allegation
that
the
secretary
in
fact
pays
some
contractors
more
than
their
pro
rata
share,
that
it
pays
some
nothing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
that
it's
in
effect
acting
--
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
"arbitrarily"
--
but
acting
in
whatever
its
best
interest
is.
so
what
protects
the
contracting
party
from
that
--
from
that
conduct,
assuming
it
were
to
be
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
says
it
has
a
policy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
allegation
is,
is
that
it's
not
following
it,
that
it's
choosing
to
pay
people
some
more
than
others.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
--
what
was
our
reference
and
acceptance
of
the
ferris
doctrine?
and
the
ferris
doctrine
was
almost
identical
to
this
situation,
where
congress
allotted
a
certain
amount
to
the
building
of
a
particular
dam,
and
the
same
--
we
applied
the
ferris
principle
and
said
even
though
they
gave
it
to
one
type
of
contract,
the
dam,
they
were
paying
1
percent
less
than
others.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
they
had
an
allotment
adequate
enough
to
cover
that
individual.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
what
the
federal
circuit
said.
i
don't
think
the
federal
circuit's
right.
if
you
read
ferris,
there
was
an
appropriation
for
the
dam.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
do
the
tribes
have
the
right
to
stop
providing
the
services--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
they've
contracted
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
they
know
that
until
they
know
what
they're
getting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
they
don't
know
what
they're
getting.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
signed
a
contract
that
says
you're
going
to
pay
them
for
their
services
to
their
members
and
for
their
administrative
costs.
they
incur
that
cost,
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
government
now
says
to
them
you've
honored
your
part,
but
we're
not
going
to
honor
ours.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
the
system
do
to
the
50-odd
contracts
that
arctic
slope,
in
its
amici
brief,
points
to
that
are
similar
to
these?
does
this
now
mean
that
moving
forward,
that
every
government
contractor
who
has
a
"subject
to
appropriations"
language
takes
the
risk
that
at
some
point
in
the
middle
of
the
contract,
the
government
is
going
to
dishonor
its
obligation
and
pay
it
less
than
it
said
it
would?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
--
how
do
we
differentiate
those
50
other
contracts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
let
congress
fix
it?
because
there
are
so
many
ways
that
congress
could
fix
this
problem
directly.
by
doing
a
line
item
allocation,
it
could
take
away
the
obligation
to
enter
into
these
contracts
and
fully
fund.
it
could
be
much
more
direct--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--than
it's
being,
given
the
interpretation
that
you're
advancing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
trying
--
it
was
trying
to
tell
the
tribes,
we
are
honoring
our
obligation
by
paying
you
the
costs,
but
we
are
really
not
going
to
do
it
because
we
are
going
to
let
the
government
give
you
less?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
to
assume
congress
intends
what
it
says.
it
intends
to
obligate
you
to
enter
into
contracts
that
--
that
give
--
make
you
commit
to
paying
their
costs,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
true
of
every
contract.
that's
where
i'm
getting
stuck
on
what
your
theory
is.
the
anti-deficiency
act
says
you
can't
spend
more
than
you're
given.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
every
single
contractor,
under
your
logic,
should
know
that
when
they
sign
a
contract,
the
government
can
break
it
because
if
it
doesn't
have
enough
funds,
it
can't
pay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
so
there's
no
real
logic
to
your
argument,
other
than
to
say
we
can't
--
we're
--
if
the
contract
says
"subject
to
appropriations",
let's
do
away
with
ferris,
let's
do
away
with
cherokee
nation
and--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
just
means
that
we
pay
you
what
we
can.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
you're
saying
is
you
make
two
promises
on
the
isda.
we're
going
to
pay
you
your
support
costs,
your
administrative
costs,
in
full,
and
we're
going
to
retain
the
right
to
break
that
promise.
that's
really
what
you're
saying
the
isda
says.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
ignore
all
the
language
where
it
says
we're
going
to
pay
you
x
amount,
all
the
law
that
says
you
have
to
be
reimbursed
--
the
tribes
have
to
be
reimbursed
for
all
their
costs;
all
of
that
is
going
to
be
ignored?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
give
me
that
cite
again.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
phillips,
this
is
an
unusual
situation
with
the
tribes
because
in
the
normal
"not
to
exceed"
appropriation
by
congress,
the
government
rightly
says
we
have
the
power
to
not
contract.
and
in
military
contracts
and
others,
we
have
a
for
convenience
cancellation.
we
have
all
sorts
of
things
that
protect
us
from
the
deficiency.
but
this
is
a
unique
situation
because
the
government,
on
the
one
hand,
despite
their
protestations
to
the
contrary,
are
forced
to
accept
these
contracts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
on
the
other
hand,
congress
is
saying,
don't
pay
more
on
them.
we
are
telling
you
to
accept
more
payment
than
we
are
going
to
give
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
should
we
create
a
special
rule
for
this
--
why
shouldn't
we
create
a
special
rule
for
this
unique
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
phillips,
how
does
congress
do
this
without
upsetting
the
entire
scheme?
knowing
that
these
contracts
are
not
all
signed
on
one
day,
that
there
are
12
regions,
that
the
negotiations
go
over
time,
how
could
congress
achieve
the
scheme
that
the
government
wants
now?
how
would
it
write
this
contract?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
you
keep
saying
that,
but
i
thought
in
your
earlier
answer
you
said
that
the
contracts
are
generally
signed
by
the
time
of
the
appropriation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
is
that
in
the
cycle
of
performance?
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
performance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
tribes
--
even
when
the
appropriation
comes
out,
they
don't
know
how
much
the
department
has
contracted
with
other
tribes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they're
performing
until
they
get
that
notice
later
on.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
dispute
mr.
phillips'
statement
that
the
tribes
don't
know
how
much
they're
getting
until
some
point
further
into
the
performance
cycle?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
system
that's
in
place
does
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
concerns
the
indian
self
determination
and
education
assistance
act
or
isda.
isda
allows
tribes
to
provide
services
like
law
enforcement
or
education
that
otherwise
would
have
been
provided
by
the
federal
government.
isda
directs
the
secretary
to
enter
into
contracts
with
willing
tribes.
under
those
contracts,
tribes
commit
to
providing
these
services
and
the
government
computes
to
paying
tribes
for
the
full
costs
of
providing
the
services.
isda
requires
the
secretary
to
promise
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
contract
support
cost
for
each
tribe's
contract,
but
each
contact
is
made
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
from
1994
to
2001,
various
tribes
entered
into
isda
contracts
with
the
government.
each
year,
congress
appropriated
more
than
enough
money
so
that
the
secretary
could
have
paid
any
individual
tribe
the
amount
of
contract
support
cost
that
tribe
was
due.
congress
did
not
appropriate
enough
money,
however,
to
allow
the
secretary
to
pay
all
tribes
in
full.
instead,
the
secretary
paid
each
tribe
only
some,
but
not
all
of
the
amount
specified
by
each
tribe's
contracts.
the
tribes,
unsatisfied,
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
on
these
facts
the
government
is
obligated
to
pay
the
tribes
the
full
amount
of
contract
support
costs
specified
by
their
contracts.
the
district
court
found
that
the
government
was
not
obligated
to
pay
tribes
more
in
the
aggregate
than
the
total
amount
that
congress
had
appropriated.
a
divided
panel
of
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
holding
the
charge
were
entitled
to
be
paid
in
full.
for
the
reasons
we
explain
more
fully
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
when
congress
appropriates
a
lump
sum
of
money
to
an
agency,
the
agency
generally
has
discretion
to
allocate
those
funds
as
it
sees
fit,
consistent
with
any
limitations
in
the
appropriation.
here,
congress
appropriated
a
large
some
of
money
that
could
have
been
used
by
the
secretary
to
pay
any
tribe's
contract
support
costs
in
full.
at
that
point,
under
long
established
principles
of
government
contracting
law,
the
government's
promise
to
pay
became
binding.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
the
secretary
entered
into
more
contracts
than
he
could
afford
to
honor
in
full,
but
when
a
government
agency
enters
into
more
contracts
that
it
can
afford
to
pay,
the
risk
of
over
obligation
generally
falls
on
the
government,
not
on
the
contractor.
the
government
advances
a
number
of
arguments
for
why
this
ordinary
rule
does
not
apply
to
isda,
but
we
find
them
unpersuasive.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
ambiguity,
congress
specified
in
isda
that
these
ambiguities
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
tribes.
as
a
result,
the
tribes
are
entitled
to
recover
for
breach
of
contract
from
the
judgment
awarded.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
alito
have
joined.
