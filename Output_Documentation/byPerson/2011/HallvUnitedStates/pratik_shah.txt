mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
postpetition
income
tax
liability
at
issue
in
this
case
is
not
subject
to
section
1222(a)(2)
and
thus
cannot
be
treated
as
a
dischargeable
nonpriority
debt
for
two
reasons.
first,
consistent
with
the
structure
of
chapter
12,
a
chapter
12
plan
is
limited
to
prepetition
debts
and
does
not
cover
postpetition
debts,
including
administrative
expenses.
rather,
postpetition
administrative
expenses
are
paid
separately
through
section
1226(b)(1),
which
contains
no
farm
sale
exception.
because
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
strips
priority
only
from
a
subset
of
claims
covered
by
a
chapter
12
plan
and
does
not
alter
which
debts
fall
within
that
plan,
it
cannot
apply
to
the
postpetition
tax
liability
at
issue.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
it
would
be
prepetition
sales.
that
is,
any
capital
gains
tax
incurred
from
a
prepetition
sale,
those
would
be
priority
expenses
covered
under
a
chapter
12
plan
under
section
1222(a)(2),
because
they
fall
under
--
they
are
an
--
they
are
a
priority
claim
under
section
507(a).
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
two
points.
one,
as
a
practical
matter
chapter
12
is
a
reorganization
provision.
it's
not
a
provision
just
designed
to
allow
farmers
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
farming.
so
often
what
will
happen
is
that
the
farmers
will
try
to
reorganize
some
of
their
farm
sale
assets,
sell
some
of
their
livestock,
change
their
farming
operation,
to
see
if
they
can
save
it
outside
of
bankruptcy
first.
all
of
those
sales
--
an
example
of
that
is
the
knudsen
case.
knudsen
is
the
only
circuit
case
to
go
petitioner's
way.
in
knudsen
it
not
only
involved
the
postpetition
tax
liability
of
the
type
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
also
had
a
significant
prepetition
tax
liability
component
in
that
case
based
upon
just
what
i
was
explaining,
the
farmer
trying
to
reorganize,
trying
to
change
the
farming
operation
to
save
the
farm
without
having
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
it
certainly
happens
within
the
bankruptcy,
and
i'm
not
disputing
your
point
that
that
may
--
that
may
arise
in
a
bankruptcy
case
just
like
it
arises
in
this
case.
and
it
will
be
dealt
through
the
bankruptcy.
that
is,
the
sale
will
happen
and
it
will
be
approved
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
question
is
how
do
you
treat
the
capital
gains
tax
arising--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
we
are
not
asking,
to
be
clear,
to
pretend
that
that's
not
there.
how
the
tax
liability
would
be
dealt
with
under
the
government's
view
is
at
the
time
the
debtor
moves
to
sell
the
farm
asset
during
the
case.
like
in
this
case,
that
sale
of
the
farm
asset
generated
$960,000.
that
was
the
sale
price.
the
capital
gain
tax
liability
in
this
case
is
$29,000.
if
they
would
have
set
aside
from
that
$960,000
sale
price
$29,000
to
pay
the
capital
gains
tax
debt,
that
would
resolve
the
issue.
we
are
not
saying
that
you
ignore
it.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
your
honor,
when
you
say
that
everybody
was
focused
on
this
problem,
we
have
the
evidence
of
exactly
one
person
as
to
what
one
legislator
thought
that
this
bill
would
do.
that's
senator
grassley.
now,
admittedly,
senator
grassley's
statements
do
indicate
an
intent
on
his
part
to
reach
postpetition
taxes.
but
the
preexisting
statutory
framework
does
not
permit
that
result.
what
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
does
is
it
allows
the
debtor
to
strip
priority
from
a
certain
subset
of
governmental
claims,
such
as
prepetition
taxes,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
senator
grassley
correctly
understood
that's
how
section
1222(a)(2)--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--a
couple
of
responses,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it's
sort
of
a
null
set
or
a
vanishingly
small
set.
there
is
the
knudsen
case
which
qualifies.
in
the
professors'
amicus
brief,
on
page
10a
of
their
amicus
brief,
they
provide
a
chart
of
representative
cases
involving
postpetition
tax
liabilities.
they
cite
eight
cases
in
their
chart
on
page
10a.
three
of
those
eight
cases
involve
significant
prepetition
tax
liabilities,
even
under
the
narrower
definition
of
"prepetition".
but
--
but
to
get
to
your
larger
point,
even
to
the
extent
it
might
be
narrower
than
what
congress
intended,
congress
certainly
knew
how
section
1222
operated
in
the
sense
that
it
would
strip
priority
from
certain
claims
that
are
already
entitled
to
priority
under
a
chapter
12
plan,
such
as
prepetition
taxes.
and
both
sides
agree
that
that's
how
section
1220(a)(2)(a)
works.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
the
dispute
is
about
whether
this
postpetition
tax
liability
comes
within
the
chapter
12
plan
in
the
first
place.
that
dispute
turns
on
preexisting
code
provisions,
part
of
the
1978
act,
part
of
the
1980
act
and
the
1986
act.
whatever
deference
senator
grassley
is
owed
as
to
the
operation
of
section
1220(a)(2)(a)
itself,
he
is
owed
no
deference
whatsoever
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
those
preexisting
code
provisions.
it's
our
position
that
these
preexisting
--
preexisting
code
provisions,
section
503(b),
section
9
--
346
and
section
1398
and
1399,
all
lead
to
the
result
that
postpetition
tax
liabilities
are
not
an
administrative
expense
within
the
meaning
of
the
code.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
employment
taxes
now,
as
a
matter
arguably
could
be
treated
differently.
of
discretion
irs
has
chosen
not
to
treat
them
differently.
that
is,
they
don't
try
to
seek
those
as
i
think
there
would
be
an
administrative
expenses.
argument
and
we
set
forth
the
argument
in
a
footnote
of
our
brief.
what
the
potential
argument
would
be
is
that
they
could
be
deemed
an
administrative
expense
not
because
they
are
incurred
by
the
estate,
but
under
the
other
part
of
the
definition
of
an
administrative
expense
under
503(b)(1)(a).
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
ah--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
so.
let
me
try
to
say
what
i
think
what
you're
saying.
under
chapter
12
and
13,
if
it
is
in
fact
a
priority
claim,
whether
it's
a
priority
claim
or
an
administrative
expense,
those
have
to
be
paid
in
full.
there
isn't
an
ability
for
the
court
t0
shave
those--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
misunderstanding
i
think
in
what
you
are
saying.
that
is,
in
a
chapter
12
plan,
the
priorities
matter
more
in
terms
of
the
relative
priority
between
category
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7
and
8.
they
matter
more
in
a
chapter
7
liquidation
where
there
is
a
finite
set
of
assets
being
liquidated
and
those
will
be
paid
out
in
the
priority
that
you
are
talking
about.
in
a
chapter
12
or
13
case,
there
is
going
to
be
a
plan
proposed
and
that
plan
will
be
confirmed.
now
under
1222(a)(2)
any
of
those
priority
claims,
whether
it's
first
priority
or
eighth
priority,
has
to
be
set
out
and
to
be
paid
in
full
in
order
for
the
plan
to
be
confirmed.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
so
the
plan
won't
be
confirmed
at
all.
there
isn't
a
matter
of
ordering
the
priorities
in
a
chapter
12
or
13
case.
now
if
i
could
turn
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
well,
your
honor,
they
are
certainly
not
administrative
expenses
under
the
definition
of
incurred
by
the
estate.
that
would
be
the
relevant
issue
in
this
case.
they
may
come
under
the
other
definition
of
administrative
expense,
that
is
the
costs
--
necessary
costs
of
preserving
the
estate,
like
wages.
if
you
consider
the
employment
payroll
tax
that
is
paid
simultaneously
as
the
wage,
that's
part
and
parcel
of
the
wages,
you
could
get
at
it
that
way.
but
again
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
"incurred
by
the
estate"
language.
the
incurred
by
the
estate
language,
as
you
properly
point
out,
is
relevant
--
the
most
relevant
provision
as
to
whether
a
tax
is
incurred
by
the
estate
are
sections
346b
and
1398
and
1399.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor
it
was
a
pressured
congress,
because
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
site,
they
say
--
and
it's
not
true
that
all
of
the
accurate
--
separate
tax
entity,
these
rules
weren't
implemented
until
afterwards.
there
--
section
346
which
dealt
admittedly
only
with
state
and
local
taxes,
they
set
up
rules,
the
same
separate
taxable
entity
rules
that
congress
later
enacted
2
years
later
to
apply
to
state
and
local
entities.
and
that's
the
provision
346
that
is
reprinted
in
our
appendix
at
page
2.
what
congress
said
when
they
passed
346
is,
1978
act
to
also
apply
to
federal
taxes,
but
it
decided
to
pull
them
out
of
the
act
so
as
not
to
step
on
the
shoes
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ways
and
means
committee.
that's
the
explanation
that
congress
provided
and
then
2
years--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it's
not
simply
taking
out
of
their
head,
your
honor,
its
section
346
rules
which
are
parallel
and
apply
to
state
and
local
taxes,
those
didn't
come
out
of
nowhere.
those
came
out
of
prior
irs
rulings
as
to
when
there
is
a
separate
taxable
entity
in
a
bankruptcy
case.
there
were
preexisting
--
before
the
1978
act,
in
particular,
there
was
a
1972
irs
revenue
ruling
which
set
forth
the
rules
about
when
there
is
a
separate
taxable
entity,
whether
the
act
should
--
whether
the
tax
should
be
taxed
to
the
estate
or
to
the
debtor.
section
346
in
the
1978
act
codified
those
rules
for
state
and
local
income
taxes.
in
the
intervening
2
years
between
1978
and
1980
when
congress
consummated
the
step
and
extended
those
to
federal
taxes,
the
irs
was
still
applying
its
preexisting
practice
based
on
its
revenue
ruling,
so
there
wasn't
a
gap
where
there
was
no
guidance
as
to
whether
--
how
to
determine
whether
these
were
incurred
by
the
estate
or
not.
courts
may
--
courts
readily
would
have
looked,
i
presume,
to
the
1972
treasury
ruling
and
the
parallel
346
rulings
in
that
gap
time
until
the
legislative
guidance
came
along,
and
then
codified
that
result
with
respect
to
federal
taxes.
now,
i
think
to--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
no,
your
honor.
there
are
two
ways
that
a
bankruptcy
estate
can
incur
a
tax.
one
is
if
it's
a
separate
taxable
entity,
then
it
--
then
it's
responsible
for
the
taxes,
all
the
taxes
are
taxed
to
the
estate
and
it
has
to
file
the
return
and
pay
it.
the
other
way
is
if
it
has
the
duty
to
file
the
return.
that's
a
different
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
section
6012(b)(3).
6012(b)(3)
also
appears
in
the
government's
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
what
6012(b)(3)
on
page
14a
says
is
that
in
a
bankruptcy
case
the
trustee
of
a
corporate
bankruptcy
estate
shall
make
the
return
for
income
in
a
corporation.
what
this
court
held
in
holywell,
which
both
sides
cite
and
both
sides
agree,
is
that
when
a
corporate
trustee
has
a
duty
to
file
a
return
under
6012(b)(3),
it
also
has
a
duty
to
pay
the
tax.
that
is,
it
incurs,
it's
liable
for
or
incurs
the
tax.
so
there
are
two
ways
to
incur
the
tax:
one
is
separate
taxable
entity;
the
other
way
is
if
the
code
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
bankruptcy
estate
to
--
to
file
and
pay
the
tax
return.
that's
the
other
way
to
interpret
it,
and
that's
why
all
the
chapter
7
and
11
corporate
cases
that
are
cited
by
petitioners
are
inapt.
in
those
cases
the
postpetition
tax
liabilities
are,
in
fact,
incurred
by
the
estate.
what
is
remarkable
is
that
petitioners
do
not
cite
a
single
chapter
12
case
in
which
a
postpetition
tax
liability
has
been
treated
as
an
administrative
expense.
chapter
12
has
been
around
since
1986,
and
yet
there
is
not
--
if
this
was
such
a
big
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
it
through
this
way,
you
would
have
expected
at
least
a
single
case
in
which
a
postpetition
tax
liability
had
been
treated
as
an
administrative
expense.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
so
the
difference
is
in
chapter
12
and
13
they
are
treated
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
plan
itself,
but
they
do
need
to
be
paid
up
front.
and
in
fact,
they
receive
a
special--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--oh,
that
they're
treated
differently?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
through
the
code.
in
chapters
12
and
13,
1226(b)(1)
and
1326(b)(1),
the
parallel
provision
in
chapter
13,
they
pull
out
administrative
expenses.
they
pull
them
out--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
your
honor,
it
would
be
to
the
government's
advantage
if
these
were
in
the
ordinary
course
--
at
least
before
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
was
enacted
that
stripped
priority,
it
would
have
been
in
the
government's
advantage
to
take
the
position
that
these
were
administrative
expenses.
and
the
reason
why
it's
favorable
to
the
government
is,
those
have
to
be
paid
up
front
as
part
of
the
bankruptcy.
if
you
don't
treat
them
as
administrative
expenses
--
and
the
government
took
the
self-denying
position
here
in
the
years
leading
up
to
2005,
consistently
taking
the
position
these
were
not
administrative
expenses,
even
though
it
was
to
the
government's
disadvantage,
because
the
code
required
that
interpretation.
and
the
disadvantage
is
you
don't
get
--
the
government
didn't
get
them
paid
up
front
as
administrative
expenses.
they
would
have
to
collect
them
outside
of
the
bankruptcy.
and
when
you
go
to
collect
them
outside
of
the
bankruptcy,
there
is
much
more
uncertainty.
there
may
not
be
any--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
that
--
that's
just
not
true.
dating
back
to
1998
--
and
these
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief
at
pages
16a
to
18a
--
dating
back
to
1998,
the
government
had
consistently
taken
the
position
that
postpetition
tax
liabilities--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--we
have
maintained
our--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--because
congress
--
the
government
has
stayed
consistent
in
its
position.
because
congress
has
changed
the
rules,
it
turns
out
that
that
same
interpretation--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
can't
speak
to
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
if
in
fact
they
wanted
to
do
that,
then
they
did
it
the
wrong
way.
they
could
have--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--you
could
easily
enact
a
separate
provision
within
1222
that
said
--
something
like
--
use
the
language
something
like
section
1305,
that
said
"any
taxes
that
become
payable
after
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
shall
be
treated
as
non-dischargeable,
nonpriority
debts
and
paid
that
way.
"
but
they
didn't
do
that.
and
i
think
section
1305
is
critical
here,
and
this
goes
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
well,
that
the
government
is
trying
to
take
advantage
here.
the
--
adopting
petitioner's
position
would
have
a
significant
ripple
effect
in
chapter
13.
this
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
trying
to
get
to
the
result
that
senator
grassley
intended
by
narrowly
interpreting
1222(a)(2)(a)
and
it
won't
have
any
other
affects
in
the
code.
it
will
have
a
significant
effect
in
the
intended
operation
of
chapter
13.
and
--
and
the
reason
why
that's
important
is,
is
to
put
this
in
perspective,
there
are
about
600
to
700
total
chapter
12
filings
each
year.
there
is
somewhere
in
the
upwards
of
400,000
chapter
13
filings
each
year,
and
here's
where
it
would
throw
a
wrench
into
chapter
13.
if
you
look
at
section
1305
of
chapter
13,
and
that's
reproduced
on
page
11a
of
the
government's
appendix.
what
1305(a)(1)
does
is
it
provides
a
special
procedure
for
the
government
to
file
a
claim
for
postpetition
taxes,
exactly
the
type
of
tax
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
says:
government,
you
can
go
file
a
claim
to
have
that
included
within
the
bankruptcy
plan.
if
--
if
you
adopt
petitioner's
position,
there
would
never
be
a
case
in
which
the
government
would
ever
have
any
occasion
to
invoke
1305(a)(1),
because
they--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it
--
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
said
it
would
be
a
significant
disruption
to
the
intended
operation
of
chapter
13.
in
practice,
it
would
actually
mean
that
the
government
comes
out
better
under
chapter
13
than
in
the
government's
current
position,
because
what
petitioner's
position
would
do,
if
you
read--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
not
even
that,
your
honor,
because
under
13
--
the
reason
why
1305(a)(1)
would
be
dead
letter
--
you
could
just
rip
that
page
out
of
the
code
and
throw
it
away
if
you
accept
petitioner's
reading.
the
reason
why
that's
true
is
because
under
their
reading
it
would
get
administrative
expense
priority,
which
are
paid
up
front,
super-priority,
even
before
anything
else;
but
under
1305
(a)(1)
it
doesn't
get
administrative
expense
priority,
it
may
not
even
get
any
priority
at
all.
and
so
it's
a
significant
change
in
the
operation
of
how
the
government
would
be
seeking
postpetition
tax
liabilities.
now,
it
would
work
to
the
detriment
of
the
debtor
in
chapter
13
cases,
the
upwards
of
400,000
chapter
13
cases
that
would
occur--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
would
--
i
would--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure,
the
capital
gains
tax
wouldn't,
but
there's
all
sorts
of
postpetition
income
taxes
that
would
arise
in
a
chapter
13
case.
in
a
chapter
13
case,
those
are
wages
that
are
being
incurred
after
the
filing
of
the
petition.
all
of
the
taxes
on
those
wages
after
the
petition
would
be
the
--
the
type
of
--
would
be
eligible
for
postpetition
tax
treatment.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
--
from
the
statistics
that
i
have
seen
on
average,
we
are
talking
about
4
months
in
a
chapter
13
case.
on
average
in
--
in
a
chapter
12
case,
according
to
the
professors'
amicus
brief,
median
time
is
about
8
months.
what's
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
the
reason
why
congress
set
up
the
chapter
13
rules
as
to
make
the
tax
incurred
by
the
debtor
rather
than
by
the
estate
is
because
congress
expressly
said
in
the
legislative
history,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
they
expected
the
confirmation
time
to
be
relatively
quickly
in
a
chapter
13
case.
we
know
that
they
made
the
same
assumption
in
the
chapter
12
case
because
1,
they
enacted
the
same
separate
taxable
entity
rules.
and
2,
they
put
in
90
days
to
actual
deadlines
in
the
code
for
chapter
13:
propose
a
plan,
45
days
to
confirm
it.
so
roughly
4
months
is
what
congress
had
extended.
now
in
practice,
it's
been
the
case
that
bankruptcy
courts
have
extended
that
time
beyond
the
statutory
deadlines.
so
perhaps
they
are
open
a
couple
months
longer
than
what
congress
had
expected.
but
that
wasn't
the
intent
that
congress
had
enacted
this
with,
and
if
congress
wants
to
change
that,
it
can
go
back
and
rewrite
the
rules
to
--
to
make
that
change.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
--
i
don't
think
it
would
have
any
adverse
effects.
and
the
reason
is
this:
the
administrative
expenses,
whether
they
are
included
in
the
plan
or
not--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--are
still
going
to
be
paid
up
front.
if
you
take
petitioner's
reading
that
administrative
expenses
are
really
part
of
the
plan
under
1222(a)(2)
rather
than
1226(b)(1),
you
now
have
a
conflict
between
1226(b)(1),
which
is
on
page
10a,
which
expressly
addresses
and
only
addresses
administrative
expenses,
and
states
that
--
this
is
on
page
10a
--
it
says
"those
will
be
paid
before
or
at
the
time
of
each
payment
to
creditors
under
the
plan.
"
if
you
also
said
that
they
come
under
1222(a)(2),
which
is
the
only
way
that
petitioner's
could
win
--
if
they
also
came
under
1222(a)(2),
1222(a)(2)
says
that
their
--
they
must
be
provided
for
full
payment
in
deferred
cash
payment.
so
deferred
interest-free
payments
over
the
life
of
a
3
to
5-year
bankruptcy
plan.
that's
very
different
than
having
them
get
superpriority
treatment
under
1226(b)(1)
and
be
paid
in
front
--
upfront
separate
from
the
plan.
so
that
--
that
is
one
significant
piece
of
textual
evidence
that
congress
thought
that
these
should
be
paid
outside
of
the
plan.
the
other
piece
of
textual
evidence
is
section
1227(a),
which
appears
on
page
10a
as
well,
and
what
it
says
is
that
"the
confirmed
plan
shall
be
binding
on
each
creditor.
"
that
is
the
only
potentially
relevant
category
to
the
government.
but
section
101
defines
creditor
--
and
this
is
on
page
1a
of
our
appendix
--
as
entity
that
has
a
claim
against
a
debtor
that
arose
at
the
time
of
or
before
the
order
for
relief
concerning
the
debtor.
that
is
a
holder
of
a
prepetition
claim.
if
a
confirmed
chapter
12
plan
is
only
binding
on
the
holder
of
a
prepetition
claim,
it
makes
no
sense
to
include
postpetition
claims
within
a
chapter
12
plan.
i
don't
even
know
what
it
would
mean
to
have
a
confirmed
--
to
have
a
plan
included
that
and
not
have
that
plan
binding
on
the
government.
and
so
i
think
if
you
take
those
two
pieces
of
textual
evidence
together,
i
think
that
strongly
supports
the
interpretation
of
1222(a)(2),
that
when
it
says
a
claim
of
the
type
specified
in
section
507,
it
means
"claim",
and
doesn't
mean
"claim
and
administrative
expense".
now
admittedly,
congress
has
not
been
perfectly
clear
in
using
that
term.
it
uses
--
sometimes
it
uses
of
the
term
"claim"
to
mean
claim
and
administrative
expense.
sometimes
it
means
it
to
only
mean
claim.
but
we
should
give
effect
to
the
distinction
between
claim
and
administrative
expense
in
light
of
1226(b)(1),
which
specifically
already
addresses
administrative
expenses.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
and
if
you
are
only
construing
that
language
in
isolation,
if
it
only
said
claim
in
507(a)(2)
and
1226(b)(1)
didn't
exist,
i
would
be
in
full
agreement
with
you
that
you
would
read
it
to
being
claim
and
administrative
expenses.
because
we
know
that
administrative
expenses
have
to
be
paid
in
some
way
in
a
bankruptcy
case.
but
1226(b)(1)
does
exist
in
this
code,
and
we
need
to
give
that
provision
effect.
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
congress
knows
how
to
include
administrative
expenses
within
a
bankruptcy
plan
when
it
wants
to.
if
you
look
at
the
corresponding
provision
in
chapter
11
as
opposed
to
the
provisions
in
chapter
12
and
13
--
this
is
section
section
1129(a)(9)(a)
--
it
expressly
provides
for
the
payment
of
administrative
expenses
within
the
context
of
the
chapter
11
plan.
chapter
12
and
13
take
a
different
approach,
and
the
court
should
give
effect
to
the
choice
that
congress
made
to
treat
administrative
expenses
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
plan.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
