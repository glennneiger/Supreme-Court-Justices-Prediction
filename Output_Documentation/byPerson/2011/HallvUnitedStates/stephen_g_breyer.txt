justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
in
a
12
or
13
case,
just
your
typical
case
--
and
this
must
arise
fairly
often
--
in
year
1,
on
january
1
the
farm
or
the
ship
or
whatever
is
the
subject
goes
into
chapter
12
or
13.
they
have
a
lot
of
pre-1
debt.
then
in
year
2
and
year
3,
the
proceedings
are
going
on,
but
the
farm
is
operating,
so
is
the
ship,
or
whatever.
and
they
earn
--
they
run
up
debts
during
that
time.
people
give
them
fertilizer
--
you
know,
all
kinds
of
things.
so
they
have
a
lot
of
debts
that
they've
run
up
in
that
time.
now,
it
draws
to
a
close
at
the
end
of
year
3.
now,
what
about
those
debts
that
have
been
run
up
during
that
time?
there
isn't
a
separate
bankruptcy
estate
for
tax
purposes,
i
understand.
but
if
joe
smith
has
loaned
his
farm
some
money
during
that
time,
and
it
comes
time
to
look
at
the
future
income
to
subtract
the
prepetition
debts,
does
his
debt
get
wound
up
and
get
some
priority
in
that
process,
or
is
he
just
at
the
end
of
the
queue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
he
gets
priority,
then
why
in
heaven's
name
shouldn't
a
tax
get
priority?
that's
your
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
does,
then,
of
course,
the
exception
that
senator
grassley
put
in
applies
to
that.
so
that's
a
question
i
should
ask
them,
given
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
--
that's
my
first
question.
what
actually
happens?
i
mean,
this
isn't
the
first
year
of
chapter
12
and
13.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
must
be
instances
where
the
--
where
the
debts
run
up
postpetition
are
pretty
big--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
there
isn't
enough
money
to
go
around
and
they
are
going
to
have
to
be
paid
out
of
future
income
along
with
the
prepetition
debts;
and
it
can
be
done,
but
there
is
a
question
of
priorities;
and
the
government
is
saying
there
is
no
priority
--
i
think
they
are
saying
that
--
for
a
postpetition
debt,
and
--
and
you're
saying:
oh,
but
of
course
there
is.
so
what
actually
happens?
there
have
been
perhaps
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases,
haven't
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
get
paid,
if
necessary,
by
assigning
priorities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
to
look
to
a
hornbook
on
--
on
bankruptcy
law
which
just
tells
me
what
you've
just
said,
i
would
look
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
following
up
on
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
looking
for
what
i
call
past
practice,
where
there
must
be
a
lot--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
would
shed
some
light
on
this.
so,
i
see
--
your
point
that
we
cannot
call
these
taxes
administrative
expenses
is
because
when
that's
defined
in
503
for
the
entire
code.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
talks
about
administrative
expenses
incurred
by
the
estate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
here
are
three
people
who
incurred
their
own
taxes.
one
is
section
12,
one
is
section
13
and
one
is
individuals
in
section
11.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
least
that's
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we
have
three
categories
of
people
that
--
where
the
taxes
literally
taken,
they
incur
postpetition
taxes.
now
the
bite
would
come
up
if
it
turned
out
when
they
were
getting
around
to
settle
these
things
that
there
isn't
enough
money
to
pay
fully
the
postpetition
or
let's
--
no,
to
pay
fully
the
domestic
support
obligations,
wages,
and
also
federal
taxes.
isn't
that
--
that's
where
it's
going
to
show
up,
because
the
question
will
be,
do
you
have
to
shave
the
federal
taxes
because
they
are
coming
in
to
be
paid
as
an
administrative
expense
priority
which
is
only
--
there
as
number
2,
i
think,
in
light
of
number
1.
or
do
you
not
shave
them
at
all.
if
they
were
liable
personally,
there
isn't
any
reduction
in
the
amount
of
the
federal
government,
if
they
are
allowed
because
it's
one
of
the
estate's
expenses
basically;
using
the
estate
very,
very
loosely
then
they
would
have
to
take
a
reduction,
too.
am
i
right?
are
you
following
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
administrative
expenses
don't
have
to
be
paid
in
full
if
there
isn't
enough
money
for
them
to
in
unsecured
claims
for
domestic
support
obligations,
because
the
administrative
expenses
is
the
second
priority,
it
isn't
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
would
it
show
up?
i
mean,
what
--
what
--
what
difference
--
suppose
--
suppose
--
in
11
individual,
12,
or
13,
what's
the
difference
whether
you
treated
it
as
an
administrative
expense
or
not,
as
long
as
they
all
have
to
be
paid
anyway,
you
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
how
would
we
know?
how
would
we
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
imagine
you
are
absolutely
right.
they
mean
to
treat
them
differently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
mean
to
treat
the
postpetition
tax
obligation
to
the
federal
government
not
as
an
administrative
expense.
but
this
is
an
instance
where
the
business
will
continue,
and
therefore,
you
have
said
in
order
to
continue
you
have
to
pay
all
your
tax
liability
and
all
your
administrative
expenses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
therefore,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
do
or
whether
you
don't
treat
them
as
administrative
expenses?
what
is
the
operational
difference?
