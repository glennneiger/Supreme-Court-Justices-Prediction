in
this
--
we're
dealing
with

farm.
suppose
a
state
had
a
similar
tax;
it
also
taxed
the
gain
on
the
sale.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument
is
made
against
your
position
that
1305
is
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
featured
i
think
both
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit,
and
their
position
seems
to
be
that
1305
gives
the
government
an
election.

ruth
bader
ginsburg

--
what
farm
sales

farm
sales
would
get
this
benefit
that
senator
grassley

wanted
them
to
have?
