the
--
the
problem
is
that,
with
an
exception
that
--
that
is
not
applicable
here,
section
1399
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
no
separate
taxable
entity
shall
result
from
the
commencement
of
a
case
under
title
xi
of
the
united
states
code.
how
can
you
incur
a
tax
when
you
are
not
a
separate
taxable
entity?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that
exception
were
intended,
the
provision
i
read
contains
an
exception.
it
says
"except
in
any
case
to
which
section
1398
applies.
"
1398
applies
to
chapter
7
and
chapter
11
where
the
debtor
is
an
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
there
is
an
additional
exception
for
chapter
12
of
the
sort
that
you
allege,
why
wasn't
that
put
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean,
then,
to
say
that
no
taxable
--
"no
separate
taxable
entity
shall
result?
"
what
does
it
mean,
unless
it
means
that
it
is
not
the
estate
which
occurs
the
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they
--
but
they
would
not
have
needed
the
exceptions
for
chapter
7
and
chapter
11
where
the
debtor
is
an
individual
if
what
you
say
is
true,
if
indeed
a
bankrupt
estate
is,
as
you
say,
not
an
entity
at
all.
