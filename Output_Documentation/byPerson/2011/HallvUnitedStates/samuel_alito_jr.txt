who
would
file
the
state
tax
return?
would
it
be
filed
by
the
estate
or
would
it
be
filed
by
the
debtor?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
just
senator
grassley.
you're
interpretation
makes
this
provision,
1222(a)(2)(a),
of
very,
very
little
practical
value.
you
think
that's
what
congress
intended?
not
only
would
it
--
would
it
mean
that
postpetition
capital
gains
on
the
sale
of
part
of
the
farm
or
the
entire
farm
would
be
outside
of
the
bankruptcy,
outside
of
the
bankruptcy,
but
all
of
the
prepetition
capital
gains
would
be
outside
of
it
too,
unless
they
occurred
in
a
previous
taxable
year.
