chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-875,
hall
v.
united
states.
ms.
freeman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
your
--
it
is
a
question
for
you,
because
these
things
don't
go
for
2
or
3
years,
do
they?
i
thought
typically
they
were
wrapped
up
very
quickly,
and
that's
to
the
advantage
of
the
debtor.
and
your
position
with
respect
to
postpetition
taxes
has
the
potential
of
extending
them
beyond
the
kind
of
quick
turnaround
that
helps
everybody.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
long
was
this
--
this
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
freeman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
make
sense,
though,
in
terms
of
if
you
are
talking
about
farmers
and
fishermen
and
you
are
talking
about
the
treatment
of
their
central
asset,
whether
it's
the
farm
or
typically
the
boat,
and
they
either
want
to
try
--
they
want
to
try
to
save
the
farm
or
the
boat,
and
they
go
into
bankruptcy
and
the
big
issue
is
how
that
asset's
going
to
be
treated
and
your
position
is
it's
not
in
the
bankruptcy
at
all,
it's
outside
of
it.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
counterintuitive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
also
i
gather
it's
a
fairly
typical
situation
where
you
have
farmers
that
might
want
to
sell
part
of
the
farm.
you
know,
they
have
dairy
and
corn
operations
or
something,
and
they
sell
one
to
try
to
preserve
the
other.
and
that's
--
that's
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
should
be
considered
in
the
bankruptcy
context,
and
yet
your
position
says
we're
going
to
treat
it
outside
the
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
big
deal
if
you're
deciding
how
the
plan's
going
to
work.
what
the
amount
was
here
was
big
for
the
farmer
and
the
idea
of
well,
we
are
going
to
pretend
that's
not
at
issue
here
seems
to
me
to
be
--
again,
not
to
make
a
lot
of
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
certainly
not
a
self-denying
position
now,
right?
you
are
arguing
that
these
are
--
that
the
taxes
of
this
sort
are
administrative
expenses
when
that
puts
you
at
the
head
of
the
line.
you
are
arguing
that
they
are
not
administrative
expenses,
same
type
of
taxes,
when
it
puts
you
at
the
back
of
the
line,
even
though
the
provision
that
puts
you
at
the
back
of
the
line
was
designed
to
particularly
help
the
fishermen
and
--
and
farmers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
position
you
are
taking
now.
you
argue
for--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--different
treatment
of
these
taxes
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
administrative
expenses
--
not
solely,
but
it
leads
to
the
result
that
you
get
the
money
first
either
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
you're
saying
that
congress
changed
the
rules
in
a
way
that,
as
justice
alito's
question
suggested,
really
doesn't
do
much
at
all,
when
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
provide
some
real
protection
for
farmers
and
fishermen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
those
are
--
those
are
small
potatoes
compared
to
the
sale
of
a
farm
and
a
boat,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
particular
issue
of
large
capital
gains
from
sale
of
significant
assets
doesn't
typically
arise
in
the
chapter
13
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
chapter
--
chapter
13
cases
are
the
ones
that
you
--
that
are
typically
resolved
very
quickly,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shah.
ms.
freeman,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-875,
hall
versus
united
states,
and
in
her
absence,
i
will
announce
the
opinion.
chapter
12
of
the
bankruptcy
code
allows
farmer
debtors
with
regular
annual
income
to
adjust
their
debts
subject
to
a
reorganization
plan.
petitioners
lynwood
and
brenda
hall
filed
for
chapter
12
bankruptcy
and
then
sold
their
farm.
the
irs
asserted
a
tax
on
the
capital
gains
from
the
postpetition
sale
of
the
farm.
now
the
halls
and
the
irs
disagreed
over
how
to
treat
the
tax.
their
disagreement
concerns
whether
postpetition
income
taxes
are
eligible
for
priority
stripping
treatment
under
11,
united
states
code,
section
1222(a)(2)(a).
now
ordinarily,
a
chapter
12
plan
must
provide
for
full
payment
of
priority
claims.
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
however,
carves
out
an
exception
whereby
certain
governmental
claims
arising
from
the
disposition
of
farm
assets
are
stripped
of
priority
status
and
downgraded
to
dischargeable,
unsecured
claims.
now
the
halls
argue
that
their
postpetition
income
taxes
are
eligible
for
the
priority
stripping
treatment
of
section
1222(a)(2)(a).
the
irs
on
the
other
hand
argues
that
1222(a)(2)(a)
applies
only
to
claims
entitled
to
priority
in
the
first
place.
the
irs
contends
that
the
halls'
postpetition
income
taxes
do
not
so
qualify
and
thus
are
neither
collectible
nor
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
the
bankruptcy
court
sided
with
the
irs,
but
the
district
court
reversed,
but
then
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
irs
that
postpetition
income
taxes
are
not
a
priority
claim
eligible
for
the
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
exception.
we
now
affirm
the
ninth
circuit.
the
parties
agree
that
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
applies
only
to
priority
claims
and
that
postpetition
income
taxes
so
qualify
only
if
they
constitute,
and
here's
a
quote,
“tax
incurred
by
the
estate”
under
section
503(b).
so
the
dispositive
question
is
whether
these
taxes
are
incurred
by
the
estate.
for
the
reasons
we
explain
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
halls'
postpetition
income
taxes
are
not
incurred
by
the
estate
and
are
neither
collectible
nor
dischargeable
in
the
chapter
12
plan.
a
tax
incurred
by
the
estate
is
a
tax
for
which
the
estate
itself
is
liable.
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
establish
that
only
certain
estates
are
liable
for
federal
income
taxes.
based
on
those
provisions,
a
chapter
12
estate
is
not
a
separate
taxable
entity
and
only
the
debtor,
not
the
estate,
can
incur
the
tax
liability.
now
we
note
that
established
understandings
in
chapter
13
hold
that
postpetition
income
taxes
are
not
incurred
by
the
estate
within
the
meaning
of
section
503(b),
because
the
taxes
are
the
liability
of
the
chapter
13
debtor
alone.
we
decline
to
adopt
a
conflicting
position
in
chapter
12
which
was
modeled
on
chapter
13.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy,
ginsburg,
and
kagan
join.
