ms.
susan
m.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
bankruptcy
estates
incur
taxes
when
they
generate
income.
the
government's
attempt
to
limit
the
effect
of
the
farm
sale
statute,
section
1222(a)(2)(a),
alters
that
fundamental
principle
in
corporate
chapter
11
cases
and
in
all
bankruptcy
cases,
as
it
requires
this
court
to
construe
the
administrative
section
and
the
priority
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
do
apply
in
all
of
those
cases.
in
a
chapter
12
case,
the
bankruptcy
estate
consists
of
more
than
just
the
assets
that
existed
as
of
the
date
of
filing.
they
also
consist
of
all
of
the
income
that
is
earned
thereafter,
wages
--
mrs.
hall's
wages
as
a
convenience
store
clerk
are
part
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
--
the
proceeds
from
selling
crops--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--from
the
period
--
from
the
petition
filing
date
until
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
yes,
it
does.
those
debts
are
incurred
in
the
operation
of
the
estate--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--yes,
your
honor.
so
that,
for
example,
in
operating
an
estate,
you
would
incur
a
light
bill
as
well
as
incurring
taxes.
all
of
the
operating
expenses
are
incurred
by
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
are
payable
from
the
income
and
from
the
estate
assets
during
that
period
from
the
petition
filing
date
until
the
confirmation
of
the
plan.
that's
the
administrative
period.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
true
of
state
taxes
as
well
as
federal
taxes.
county
taxes,
for
example.
property
taxes--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--correct,
your
honor,
and
it
did
in
this
particular
case.
so
there
would
be
state
taxes
on
the
capital
gains,
and
those
would
also
be
administrative
expense
priorities,
except
for
the
farm
sale
provision
here,
which
demotes
that
priority
if
the
debtor
is
able
to
earn
a
discharge.
and
if
so,
then
those
farm
sale
taxes
are
demoted
in
priority
and
may
be
discharged
under
a
plan
of
reorganization.
they
would
share
pro
rata
with
the
other
prepetition
claims
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
the
debtor
and
the
estate
are
one
in
a
--
in
a
reorganization
case.
and
so
the
taxpayers,
lynwood
and
brenda
hall,
would
file
the
tax
return.
the
way
that
it
would
actually
be
administered,
your
honor,
is
shown
by
the
knudsen
case.
and
basically,
there
would
be
a
tax
return
that
includes
all
of
the
income,
the
wages,
the
crop
sale
proceeds
and
so
forth.
and
then
it
would
compute
it
with
the
capital
gains
tax,
and
there
would
be
a
separate
pro
forma
return
that
does
not
include
the
capital
gains
tax.
those
would
be
sent
to
the
special
procedures
unit
of
the
irs,
so
that
somebody
there
would
know
how
to
deal
with
it
and
would
be
able
to
count
the
difference.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
section
346,
your
honor,
basically
makes
the
state
taxes
consistent
with
the
federal
taxes.
when
you
have--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--justice
sotomayor,
i
do
not
think
it
does,
in
the
sense
--
in
this
sense.
the
bankruptcy
--
section
346(b)
made
the
state
and
local
taxes
consistent
with
federal
taxes,
and
when
you
have
a
bankruptcy
estate
that
consists
only
of
assets
on
the
petition
filing
date,
then
you
have
a
separate
taxable
entity
with
a
separate
tax
i.d.
number
that
is
set
up.
but
under
the
federal
bankruptcy
--
under
the
federal
tax
code,
under
section
1399,
whenever
the
bankruptcy
estate
had
income
during
the
course
of
the
estate,
during
the
administration
period,
as
well
as
the
assets
on
the
petition
filing
date,
then
it's
a
single
taxable
entity.
and
so
that
single
taxpayer
would
pay
it.
section
346
doesn't
say
what
assets
are
used
to
pay
the
tax.
that's
a
matter
of
bankruptcy
law.
the
debtor,
the
individual
taxpayer,
is
going
to
file
the
tax
return
under
state
and
local
and
federal
law,
but
he's
going
to
use
the
estate
assets
because
that's
all
there
is.
he
doesn't
have
any
other
assets.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
the
debtor
pays--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--right.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
correct.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
going
to
be
on
the
debtor's
tax
return.
the
debtor's
the
one
who
will
have
the
deductions
and
the
deductions
would
include
administrative
expenses
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
the
debtor
pays
the
taxes,
but
with
estate
assets,
because
those
are
the
only
assets
that
exist.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
the
last
sentence,
i
believe,
your
honor,
deals
with
the
partnership,
and
in
a
partnership
case,
just
as
outside
a
bankruptcy
the
partnership
files
the
tax
return
and
the
partners
individually
are
the
ones
who
pay
the
taxes.
but
they
pay
the
taxes
--
if
a
partner
is
in
its
own
bankruptcy
estate
with
the
only
assets
that
exist,
all
of
his
income,
all
of
his
wages,
all
of
those
are
property
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
he
would
use
it
to
pay
the
taxes.
he's
not
individually
liable
any
more
than
if
a
trustee
were
individually
liable.
the
trustee
in
a
bankruptcy
case
uses
estate
assets
to
pay
taxes.
and
so
with--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--the
--
the
debtor
ultimately
is
the
one
who
receives
a
discharge.
discharge
provisions
are
separate
than
the
--
than
the
tax
payment
issues.
tax
payment
deals
with
what
monies
are
used
to
make
the
payments
of
taxes
during
the
course
of
administration
of
a
bankruptcy
case.
the
debtor
receives
a
discharge
in
a
chapter
12
case
if
it
complies
--
if
he
complies
with
all
of
the
provisions
of
his
plan
of
reorganization
and
then
receives
a
discharge.
there
are
exceptions
to
the
discharge.
certain
prepetition
taxes
are
excepted
from
a
discharge
and
would
carry
through
during
the
--
postpetition.
but
the
farm
sale
statute
provides
that
these
particular
administrative
expenses
would
be
subject
to
a
discharge
if
he
complies
with
the
rest
of
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
his
plan
of
reorganization.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
he
does
get
priority
in
that
process,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
your
honor,
it
does
have
that
priority.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
those
taxes,
along
with
the
light
bill
and
any
other
administrative
expenses,
would
be
paid
when
due
over
that
2
or
3-year
period.
and
that's
certainly
what
happens
in
the
large
chapter
11
bankruptcy
case,
like
a
delphi
bankruptcy
case
or
a
general
motors--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
chapter
12
cases
often
the
bankruptcy
estate
will
drag
on
for
2
or
3
years,
and
certainly
for
longer
than
1
year,
and
much
longer
than
a
chapter
13
case,
because
you
do
have
sales
of
assets.
you
have
debts
that
need
to
be
restructured.
you
have
leases
that
end
up
getting
rejected.
you
have
a
--
new
crop
subsidies
that
are
applied
for
and
received.
the
chapter
--
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
professors
has
a
study,
and
shows
how
long
chapter
12
cases
generally
last--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--this
case,
your
honor,
because
of
this
appeal
has
lasted
from
2005
through
today,
so
a
considerable
period
of
time.
and
all
of
the
taxes
during
that
period
of
time
and
all
of
the
operating
expenses
during
that
period
of
time
are
administrative
expenses
and
are
payable
in
the
ordinary
course.
there
is
an
administrative
expense
claim
if
in
fact
they
haven't
been
paid.
and
if
--
if
one
of
the
creditors
has
not
received
payment
or
if
a
taxing
authority
has
not
received
payment,
it
can
move
for
payment
as
an
administrative
priority.
it
can
ask
that
it
be
paid
now,
and
it
can
ask
that
the
case
be
dismissed
if
it
hasn't
been
paid.
so
you
--
you
do
have
that
highest
priority,
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
court's
nicholas
case,
1966,
which
preceded
the
bankruptcy
code
and
which
the
bankruptcy
code
really
incorporated
and
continued
with.
in
the
nicholas
case
the
court
said
that
all
taxes
incurred
by
a
debtor-in-possession
and
incurred
during
the
administration
period
have
administrative
expense
priority,
and
they
are
payable
by
the
debtor-in-possession
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
as
the
administrator
of
the
estate
under
28
u.s.c.
section
960,
which
is
still
in
effect
today,
and
which
requires
that
the
person
in
control
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
whether
it's
a
trustee
or
a
debtor
in
possession,
pay
those
taxes,
but
not
pay
them
with
his
own
money.
as
the
court
said
in
the
nicholas
case,
you
pay
them
with
the
assets
of
the
estate.
the
individual
trustee
is
not
responsible;
the
individual
debtor
in
possession
is
not
responsible.
the
responsibility
of
the
debtor-in-possession
really
is
a
matter
of
the
discharge
provisions,
whether
he's
going
to
be
separately
discharged
or
if
he
has
responsible
person
liability
because
he's
--
he's
--
you're
dealing
with
trust
fund
taxes,
with
wages
from
some
other
person.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
1226?
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
uh-huh.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
your
honor,
respectfully,
you
would
cause
untold
harm
because
this
provision
applies
in
corporate
chapter
11's
and
in
all
bankruptcy
cases.
they
all
have
the
administrative
expense
provision,
503,
and
they
all
have
section
507.
so
you
would
stop
taxes
from
being
payable
in
a
big
delphi--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--right.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
right.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
and
claim--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--you
can,
your
honor,
because
101
of
the
code
as
right
to
payment.
"creditor"
is
defined
as
someone
who
has
a
claim
that
arose
prepetition,
which
necessarily
means
claim
is
broader
and
not
just
one
that
arose
prepetition.
there
are
numerous
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
that
refer
to
administrative
expenses
as
claims,
including
1226.
and
so
the
court
can
see
that
those
are
interpreted
consistently.
this
court
in
the
hartford
underwriters
case
referred
to
administrative
claims,
calling
them
claims
as
well
as
administrative.
and
really
what
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
administrative
expenses
are
outside
of
bankruptcy
altogether,
that
they
are
not
part
of
what
get
paid
in
a
bankruptcy
case.
and
that's
simply
untrue.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
provisions
with
respect
to
requirements
of
a
plan,
including
1222(a),
which
apart
from
the
exception,
it
says
that
administrative
expenses
are
required
to
be
paid.
section
1228
says
that
a
plan
discharges
all
debts
including
debts
provided
for,
allowed
under
section
503.
debt
is
a
liability
on
a
claim.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
right.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
and--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--and
administrative
expenses
do
get
paid
in
the
ordinary
course.
and
if--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--yes.
they
have
administrative
priority
and
they
do
get
paid.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
we
--
we've
cited
a
number
of
hornbooks
that
have
exactly
that
provision.
what
is
particular
interesting
with
respect
to
the
government's
position
here
is
that,
at
the
government's
urging
section
507(a)(8)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
that
provided
for
prepetition
priority,
eighth
priority,
for
prepetition
taxes
within
a
short
period
before
the
bankruptcy
code,
was
amended;
so
that
all
of
those
eighth
priority
taxes
during
the
year
of
the
filing,
the
straddle
year
--
here
the
halls
filed
their
bankruptcy
case
in
august,
so
during
the
entire
period
from
january
1
through
august
when
they
filed
--
are
treated
as
administrative
expenses.
and
yet
now
they
say
administrative
expenses
mean
nothing
and
they
don't
get
any
payment
as
administrative
expenses.
why
urge
the
change?
why
make
all
of
those
year
of
filing
taxes
into
administrative
expenses
and
then
say
the
administrative
expenses
have
no
meaning?
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
there
are
several
cases
that
have
interpreted
section
1222(a)(2)(a).
none
of
them
have
addressed
the
change
in
507
or
what
that
means.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
okay.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
right.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
i
think
that's--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--i--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--none
outside
of
this
tax
situation.
and
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
that
have
followed
the
government's
interpretation
of
this
farm
sale
statute,
1222(a)(2)(a),
have
addressed
the
impact
on
other
administrative
expenses
and
other
tax
claims.
the
wages
--
the
taxes
on
wages
that
are
incurred,
the
lottery
winnings
that
an
individual
farmer
may
have,
and
the
fact
that
those
have
administrative
priority
and
that
those
would
need
to
be
paid
off
the
top
as
administrative
expenses
--
none
of
the
cases
address
those.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
okay.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
and
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
it
does
have
these
broad
impacts
and
none
of
the
courts
have
really
addressed
it,
and
i
don't
believe
that
certainly
the--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
to
incur--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--incurred
--
to
incur
is
to
take
on
liability.
so
at
the
point
in
time
that
income
is
generated
during
a
bankruptcy
case,
then
liabilities
are
taken
on
at
the
same
time,
the
operating
expenses,
the
taxes.
here
you
had
a
clear
estate
asset,
the
hall
farm.
it
was
sold.
that
generates
an
income
tax
liability,
a
capital
gains
liability,
and
so
that
is
--
it
--
it's
tied
to
the
income
which
is
here
property
of
the
estate.
the
--
the--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--your
honor,
because
you
are
a
single
taxable
entity
instead
of
a
separate
taxable
entity.
the
whole
reason
for
the
separate
taxable
entity
section
was
when
you
had
a
bankruptcy
estate
that
consisted
only
of
the
assets
on
the
petition
filing
date,
and
the
debtor
earns
income
independently,
so
the
debtor
would
independently
have
tax
liability,
and
that
would
be
separate
from
the
estate.
but
when
you
have
a
reorganization
case,
a
corporate
chapter
11
or
a
chapter
12,
then
the
estate
and
the
debtor
are
a
single
taxable
entity
and
the
debtor
is
the
one
that
files
the
tax
returns
or
the
debtor-in-possession
or
the
trustee,
if
there
is
a
trustee
in
control--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--that's--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--there
is
no
exception
and
there
shouldn't
be
an
exception,
your
honor.
they
are
within
section
1399,
just
like
corporate
chapter
11
debtors.
the
debtor
is
the
one
that
files
the
tax
return.
the
debtor
and
estate
are
one.
all
of
that
corporate
earnings,
all
of
the
wages,
the
lottery
winnings,
the
farm
sale
proceeds,
all
of
those
are
part
of
the
estate.
and
so--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--your
honor,
respectfully,
there
is
a
difference
between
taxable
entity
and
estate.
the
estate
is
a
collection
of
property,
that
is
the
collection
of
property
that
is
operated
by
the
debtor-in-possession
or
trustee
in
a
reorganization
case.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
you
need
that
exception,
your
honor,
in
a
chapter
7
case
for
an
individual
because
the
individual
earns
income
that
is
wholly
independent
from
the
estate,
that
is
not
part
of
the
estate.
so
that
the
bankruptcy
estate
consists
of
the
assets
that
the
individual
owns
on
the
petition
filing
date.
the
trustee
administers
those,
sells
the
assets,
may
incur
some
liability
for
selling
the
assets
for
taxes,
pays
those
and
deals
with
those,
while
the
individual
continues
to
earn
income
postpetition
that's
his
own
income.
and
so
you
need
to
have
a
separate
taxable
estate
in
those
instances.
but
when
the
income
that's
earned
during
this
whole
period
of
administration,
from
the
petition
filing
date
to
the
confirmation
date
of
the
plan,
is
all
property
of
the
estate,
then
the
debtor,
the
corporate
chapter
11
debtor
or
the
corporate
chapter
12
debtor
or
the
individual
chapter
12
debtor
is
incurring
that
income
as
part
of
the
estate.
estate
in
a
chapter
12
case.
it's
all
property
of
the
section
1207
says
that.
and
so
the
debtor
is
the
one
that
files
the
tax
returns
and
the
debtor
uses
the
estate
assets
to
make
the
payments
of
the
taxes
and
to
make
the
payments
on
the
light
bill,
and
to
make
the
payments
on
all
of
the
other
expenses
of
administration
during
this
period
of
administration.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
nicholas
and
that
continues
on
in
effect
today.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
it
uses
the
term
"incurred
by
the
estate"
i
think
based
upon
the
same
kind
of
language
that
this
court
used
in
nicholas,
as
incurred
by,
incurred
during
the
administration
period,
incurred
by
the
debtor-in-possession.
it's
really
a
broad
sense
of
all
of
the
kinds
of
bankruptcy
estates
in
a
chapter
7
case.
this
refers
to
all
bankruptcy
cases.
and
so
in
a
chapter
7
case
it's
going
to
be
just
the
assets
that
exist
there
on
the
petition
filing
date.
if
it's
a
corporate
case
it's
going
to
be
all
of
the
assets
that
are
generating
the
income
during
the
course
of
the
administration
of
the
chapter
12
or
the
chapter
11
case
or
even
the
chapter
13
case.
in
chapter
13
cases
you
have
a
specific
additional
provision,
section
1305,
that
deals
with
taxes
payable
postpetition,
and
it
also
includes
postconfirmation,
so
it
gives
the
government
a
broader
kind
of
right
so
that--
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
--it
does,
your
honor,
provide
for
an
election
for
the
government.
what's
important
is
that
in
a
13
case,
unlike
a
12
or
an
11,
you
have
a
very
short
period
of
administration.
they
have
to
file
their
plan
within
15
days.
it's
confirmed
within
a
month
or
2.
and
it's
very
unlikely
that
april
15th
is
going
to
fall
within
that
short
period
of
time
and
that's
when
the
government
says
that
your
taxes
are
incurred.
so
you're
going
to
have
a
--
it's
unlikely
you're
going
to
have
an
administrative
expense
claim
for
your
income
taxes
during
the
period
of
administration
of
a
chapter
13.
it's
a
very
short
period.
so
the
government
has
the
option
not
only
during
the
administration
period,
but
also
during
the
whole
period
of
the
plan,
to
elect
to
say:
all
right,
there
have
been
some
big
commissions
earned
here
and
i
want
to
go
ahead
and
collect
from
the
estate
rather
than
just
wait
and
see
what
the
debtor
earns
afterwards.
and
so
it
then
can
go
ahead
and
file
a
claim
and
ask
to
have
that
claim
paid
out
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
it
really
gives
the
government
much
broader
rights
than
it
does
in
a
normal
chapter
11
or
a
chapter
12
case
or
a
7.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
thank
you.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
your
honor,
one
of
the
first
things
that
mr.
shah
said
was
that
the
debtor
should
have
set
aside
$29,000
from
the
sale
proceeds
to
pay
the
taxes.
that's
$29,000
in
sale
proceeds
of
property
of
the
estate.
and
yes,
those
are
ordinarily
set
aside
to
pay
the
taxes.
that's
how
bankruptcy
cases
work.
because
you
have
1222(a)(2)(a),
that
$29,000
didn't
need
to
be
used
to
pay
the
taxes,
and
instead
was
set
aside
to
be
treated
under
the
plan
of
reorganization,
where
that
tax
claim
could
be
demoted
in
priority
to
a
prepetition
claim
and
discharged.
but
the
ordinary
course
is
that
the
sale
proceeds
are
used
to
pay
the
taxes,
the
administrative
expenses.
that's
how
bankruptcy
works.
and
the
government's
argument
here
completely
undercuts
that.
with
respect
to
section
1305,
the
language
is
different
because
it
uses
the
word
"payable".
it
includes
all
postpetition,
postconfirmation,
all
the
way
through
to
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy
case.
not
just
the
short
period
of
administration.
in
chapter
13
cases,
you
still
have
to
pay
administrative
expenses.
it's
just
that
it's
pretty
rare
that
you
have
a
tax
that
is
incurred
during
that
short
period
of
administration.
and
so
you
have
a
separate
statute
that
covers
the
whole
period
through
the
entirety
of
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
court
--
mr.
shah
was
asked
about
cases
where
--
and
in
fact
an
administrative
expense
claim
was
incurred
for
a
capital
gains
tax
in
the
chapter
12
case.
we
would
cite
the
court
to
the
specht
case.
a
copy
of
that
is
attached
to
the
professors'
amicus
brief.
and
that
shows
where
a
plan
was
defeated
because
of
the
large
capital
gains
tax
from
the
sale
of
the
family
farm.
and
that
in
fact
is
cited
in
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
legislative
--
not
the
legislative
history,
but
some
of
the
commentary
about
one
of
the
reasons
why
senator
grassley
supported
section
1222(a)(2)(a)
and
drafted
it
in
the
first
place.
this
prevents
a
plan
from
being
confirmed
in
so
many
chapter
12
cases,
family
farmers
are
not
able
to
go
through
with
their
plans.
and
that's
why
you
have
the
demotion
in
priority.
it
does
have
very
little
practical
value
if
in
fact
it
only
applies
to
prepetition
sales
--
and
not
just
prepetition
but
more
than
a
year
prepetition
in
most
instances.
the
professors'
amicus
brief
just
refers
to
prepetition,
and
this
little
chart
doesn't
say
that
those
are
not
within
the
scope
of
507(a)(8)
--
and
those
eighth
priority
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
freeman
thank
you.
