justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
include
debts
incurred
after
the
filing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
debts
--
debts
that
were
incurred
after
that
date?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
says
the
estate
--
the
estate's
not
liable
for
the
tax
imposed
on
the
partners.
so
if
it's
not
liable,
how
can
it
ask
for
a
discharge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
what
you
say
to
me
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense,
but
i
think
one
of
their
stronger
arguments
is,
it
may
make
sense,
but
unfortunately,
even
if
senator
grassley
and
the
others
wanted
it,
they
didn't
do
it
right
technically.
they
didn't
amend
the
right
provision
of
the
code,
and
whoever's
fault
that
is,
is
beside
the
point.
so
there
is
no
way
to
get
the
words
to
get
to
the
result
that
you
want.
i'll
tell
you
the
best
i
could
do,
and
i
see
a
problem
with
it.
if
you
say
that
--
you
go
to
1226(b)(1)
and
it
says
that
any
unpaid
claim
of
the
kind
specified
in
507(a)(2)
--
and
507(a)(2)
talks
about
administrative
expenses
and
refers
you
to
503;
and
503
includes
taxes
and
administrative
expenses
--
and
then
you
say
it's,
at
1220
whatever
it
is,
what
did
i
just
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
1226.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
like
an
abbott
and
costello
movie.
[laughter]
the
--
the
--
you
get
to
1226(b)(1)
and
it
says
that
that
that's
--
shall
be
paid
any
unpaid
payments
of
that
kind,
including
administrative
expenses,
and
--
and
so
then
you
have
1222(a),
which
refers
to
that
and
then
the
amendment
applies
to
that.
but
what
i
did
was
i
sloughed
over
by
talking
too
quickly
--
it
talked
about
507(a)(2).
and
when
you
look
to
507(a)(2),
it
talks
about
claims
and
expenses;
and
then
in
(2)
there
it
refers
to
administrative
expenses.
and
so
i
think
the
government
says
they
left
out
what
was
key
to
you,
the
word
"expense".
all
right?
now,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doing
when
i
start
tinkering
with
this
bankruptcy
code.
and
is
that
just
true,
what
they
say?
it
does
leave
out
the
word
"expenses".
will
--
will
we
cause
untold
harm
if
we
were
to
read
the
word
"claims"
there
to
include
expenses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
i
was
thinking,
so
if
i
do
it
by
reading
the
word
"claims"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
5
--
in
1226,
when
it
says
"any
unpaid
claim"--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
is
what
you
want
to
have
include
taxes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
read
that
word
as
including
both
the
507(a)
claims,
which
are
in
(1)(a),
(1)(b),
and
--
also
administrative
expenses
in
(2).
can
i
do
that?
