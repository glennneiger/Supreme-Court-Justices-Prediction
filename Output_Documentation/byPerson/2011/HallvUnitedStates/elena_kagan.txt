but,
ms.
freeman,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
then
that
the
taxes
are
incurred
by
the
debtor
and
payable
out
of
the
estate.
why
does
it
say
"incurred
by
the
estate"?
justice
elena
kagan
but
there's
every
reason
to
think,
mr.
shah,
that
what
congress
was
worried
about
here
was
cases
in
which
the
bankruptcy
plan
would
not
be
approved
at
all
because
there
were
very
high
capital
gains
taxes
that
would
result
from
a
sale;
and
that
that
was
the
problem
that
everybody
was
focused
on,
was
making
sure
that
farmers
could
take
advantage
of
section
12.
so
it's
a
little
bit
odd
--
it's
actually
more
than
a
little
bit
odd.
it's
a
lot
odd
to
read
the
statutes
to
apply
not
in
that
context,
but
only
as
to
people
who
have
somehow
managed
to
sell
their
property,
you
know,
18
months
before
going
into
bankruptcy.
justice
elena
kagan
how
does
that
work,
mr.
shah,
because
this
is
the
part
of
your
argument
that
i
have
to
say
sort
of
tripped
me
up.
justice
elena
kagan
because
you
define
2
years
and
4
years
after
the
phrase
that
you
are
trying
to
define.
justice
elena
kagan
so
it
must
have
been
a
very
pressured
congress.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
are
saying
that
as
of
1978
there
was
kind
of
an
idea
in
people's
heads
about
this
separate
tax
entity
or
at
least
in
some
people's
heads,
but
that
idea
had
never
been
converted
into
any
statutory
language.
and
you
are
suggesting
that
we
should
take
this
phrase
"incurred
by
the
estate"
and
read
it
as
if
they
were
referring
to
something
real
that
was
in
a
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
another
question--
justice
elena
kagan
--while
we
are
on
this,
because
the
1398,
1399
would
suggest
that
we
are
looking
to
this
separate
taxable
entity.
but
if
i
understand
correctly,
in
the
corporate
context
the
irs
actually
does
not
look
to
that.
it
looks
to
just
the
question
of
whose
filing
the
tax
return.
so
if
that's
the
case,
aren't
you,
in
that
very
large
bankruptcy
context,
losing
your
textual
anchor
entirely?
justice
elena
kagan
why
would
that
be
a
problem?
you
said
that
there
would
be
a
significant
ripple
effect
and
practical
difficulties.
and
i
understand
your
argument
about
13
shows
that
you
have
to
do
this
and
why
would
13
be
necessary
if
petitioner
were
right,
but
you
started
out,
i
thought--
justice
elena
kagan
--by
trying
to
show
us
that
it
would
be
a
significant
practical
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
so
it
just
does
automatically
for
the
government
what
is
now
done
by
--
by
some
kind
of
government
filing?
