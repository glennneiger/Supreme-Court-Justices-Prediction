justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
how
do
you
deal
with
section
346?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
read
346(b)
to
say
that,
unless
the
estate
is
a
separate
tax
entity
under
the
code,
that
the
debtor,
not
the
estate,
pays
state
and
local
taxes.
this
is
totally
contrary
to
what
you're
saying,
but
the
language
of
346(b)
basically
answers
the
question
against
you
with
respect
to
state
and
local
taxes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
debtor
is
going
to
pay,
and
so
when
this--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--says
--
whenever
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1986
provides
that
no
separate
taxable
estate
shall
be
created
in
a
case
concerning
a
debtor
under
this
title--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--chapter
12
doesn't
create
a
separate
taxable
estate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
the
income,
et
cetera,
shall
be
taxed
to
or
claimed
by
the
debtor
under
state
or
local
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
--
this
is
hard
for
me
to
understand,
given
the
last
line.
"the
estate
shall
be
liable
for
any
tax
imposed
on
such
corporation
or
partnership,
but
not
for
any
tax
imposed
on
partners
or
members.
"
by
the
logic
of
that
last
sentence,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
preceding
section
is
not
looking
to
the
estate,
but
to
the
debtor,
to
pay
the
taxes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
--
why
would
the
last
sentence
be
necessary?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
going
to
ask
the
government
this,
but
are
you
aware
of
any
circuit
split
or
any
cases
below
that
have
accepted
the
government's
arguments
that
chapter
12
involves
prepetition
debts
only
and
that
don't
pay
administrative
expenses
postbankruptcy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
government's
now
saying
that
chapter
12
involves
only
prepetition
claims.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it's
basically
by
that
argument
saying
it
doesn't
involve
and
can't
involve
administrative
expenses.
their
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
i'm
asking
is
--
that's
how
i
read
are
there
any
courts
that
you
are
aware
of
below
who
have
been
presented
with
this
argument
outside
of
the
tax
situation
who
have
accepted
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
have
failed
to
give
priority
to
administrative
expenses?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
asking
you
to
defend
their
position.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
just
such
a
broad
position
that
i'm
trying
to
understand
if
there
is
a
split
out
there
that
we
are
unaware
of.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
can
we
go
back
to
the
issue
that
gives
me
trouble?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
to
read
"incurred
by
the
estate".
if
the
estate
doesn't
pay
taxes--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
could
it
be
incurred
by
the
estate
when
congress,
if
it
intended
what
you're
saying
it
intended,
could
have
said
"incurred
during
bankruptcy"?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
turn
back
to
--
before
you
answer
my
other
question,
could
you
finish
your
thought
about
what
you
are
doing
with
wages?
are
they
given
priority
or
aren't
they?
if
you
are
saying
they
are
not,
if
we
accept
your
reading
of
this
employee
wage
taxes
are
not
administrative
expenses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
before
you
finish,
could
you
answer
my
question
of
what
impact
your
broader
reading
--
your
chapter
12
affects
only
prepetition
debts
--
what
else
is
that
kind
of
holding
going
to
affect?
your
narrow
alternative
holding
affects
just
this
issue.
that
broader
reading
--
i
worry
about
a
broader
reading
when
i
don't
know
its
impact.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
two
are
used
interchangeably
by
everyone.
congress,
the
court--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
government
in
many
situations,
given
the
broad
definition
of
"claims",
the
only
logical
conclusion
is
that
it
includes
a
subset,
a
liability
created
by
administrative
expenses.
