well,
mr.
lewin,
what
power
is
congress
exercising
here?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
lewin,
this
gets
back
to
the
question
of
exactly
what
congressional
power
you
are
basing
your
argument
on.
you
started
by
saying
you
were
basing
it
on
congress's
passport
power,
which
is
a
function
of
its
control
over
immigration
issues.
now
you
are
saying
congress
has
a
co-equal
recognition
power.
which
is
it,
or
is
it
both?
justice
elena
kagan
but
it's
a
passport
statute
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry.
it's
a
passport
statute
that
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
immigration
functions
that
passport
statutes
usually
serve.
it
seems
to
have
everything
to
do
with
congress's
declaration
of
a
foreign
policy,
as
opposed
to
congress's
exercise
of
power
relating
to
immigration
control.
so
convince
me
that
i
am
wrong
on
that.
justice
elena
kagan
that
might
be
true,
mr.
lewin.
i
think
you
would
have
a
better
argument
if
this
statute
said
if
you
were
born
in
jerusalem
you
can
pick
anything
you
want
in
your
passport;
you
can
pick
jerusalem,
you
can
pick
israel
or
you
can
pick
palestine.
but
the
statute
in
fact
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
you
can
pick
israel.
so
why
isn't
that
a
statement
of
foreign
policy
as
to
recognition
that
jerusalem
is
the
capital
of
israel
as
opposed
to
what
you
are
characterizing
it
as,
which
is
a
sort
of
freedom
of
sort
of
choice
provision?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
have
to
be
very
old
to
say
palestine.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose,
general
verrilli,
suppose
that
this
statute,
there
was
a
--
the
section
that's
there
now
and
then
there
was
another
section,
and
the
section
said:
"the
recording
of
israel
as
a
place
of
birth
on
a
passport
shall
not
constitute
recognition
of
israel's
sovereignty
over
jerusalem.
"
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
my
statute
has
a
title
which
says
"identification
of
persons
born
in
jerusalem.
"
justice
elena
kagan
general
verrilli,
is
the
textural
basis
for
your
argument
that
the
president
has
exclusive
power
here?
is
it
the
receipt
of
ambassadors
clause
alone,
or
is
it
something
else?
because
i
was
frankly
a
little
bit
surprised
that
your
brief
put
so
much
weight
on
that
receipt
of
ambassadors
clause,
which
arguably
was
meant
to
give
the
president
a
purely
ministerial
function.
and
so
literally,
on
any
other
power
that
the
president
has.
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
that
provision
were
not
in
the
constitution,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
you
are
now?
