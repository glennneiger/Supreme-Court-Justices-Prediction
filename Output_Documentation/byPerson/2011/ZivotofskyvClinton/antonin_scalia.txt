justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lewin,
you're
--
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
arguing
for
a
co-equal
congressional
power,
you
are
arguing
for
a
superior
congressional
power.
you
are
saying
whatever
congress
says,
the
president
has
to
comply
with.
now,
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
they
both
have
authority
in
the
field.
and
if
they
both
have
authority
in
the
field
and
they
are
exercising
it
in
different
fashions,
i
frankly
would
not
be
inclined
to
intervene.
i
would
let
--
i
would
them
conduct
the
usual
inter-branch
hand
wrestling
that
goes
on
all
the
time,
which
probably
means
that
if
congress
cares
enough
congress
will
win,
because,
as
you
say,
it
has
an
innumerable
number
of
clubs
with
which
to
beat
the
executive.
but
if
--
if
the
power
is
a
co-equal
power
and
they
are
both
exercising
it
in
a
--
in
a
different
way,
why
don't
we
just
--
just,
you
know,
let
them
go
at
it?
why
is
it
any
of
our
business
which
is
the
better
foreign
policy
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
is
supreme,
then?
that
is
your
position.
not
--
not
that
congress
has
co-equal
authority
with
the
executive,
but
congress
is
supreme?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
medellin
involved
a
situation
where
the
president's
purported
exercise
of
authority
changed
domestic
law,
and
not
simply
domestic
law,
but
domestic
state
law.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
a
distinguishable
circumstance.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
were
we
scrutinizing
in
the
steel
seizure
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
presidential
power
would
have
supported
that,
the
war
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
he
was
claiming
that
the
korean
war--
justice
antonin
scalia
--required
that
these
--
that
these
companies
remain
in
business.
and
i
guess
we
did
scrutinize
that.
what
did
we
conclude,
that
that
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
a
personal
identification
choice
can
also
have
significant
foreign
policy
implications,
can
it
not?
is
--
is
that
an
either-or
situation?
what
the
state
department
is
saying
is
to
allow
this
particular
personal
identification
choice
may
antagonize
some
foreign
nations
that
we
don't
want
to
antagonize.
what
if
they
gave
them
the
choice
of
saying
"israel,
the
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east.
"
okay,
that's
their
choice.
they
can
have
that
on
their
passport.
would
that
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
the
recognition
of
a
breakaway
province
of
a
foreign
country
by
the
united
states
will
clearly
provoke
a
war
with
that
country.
would
congress
have
the
power
to
decree
that
the
president
shall
not
recognize
that
breakaway
province,
knowing
--
knowing
that
if
he
does
recognize
it,
that
country
will
declare
war
on
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
we
have
a
foolish
president.
[laughter]
contrary
to
our
entire
history,
we
have
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
please
stay
on
this.
i
am
--
i
am
willing
--
our
--
our
cases
say
repeatedly
that
the
president
is
the
sole
instrument
of
the
united
states
for
the
conduct
of
foreign
policy,
but
to
be
the
sole
instrument
and
to
determine
the
foreign
policy
are
two
quite
different
things.
to
say
he's
the
sole
instrument
simply
means
that
congressmen
traveling
abroad,
or
globetrotting
ex-presidents,
nobody
except
the
president
of
the
united
states
pronounces
the
foreign
policy.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
president
determines
everything
in
foreign
policy.
he's
the
instrument,
but
there
is
certainly
room
in
--
in
those
many
cases
for
saying
that
congress
can
say
what
the
--
what
it's
--
what
the
country's
instrument
is
supposed
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
the
best
there
is.
i
mean,
if
you've
got
to
cast
about
for
something,
i
suppose
--
i
don't
know
what
else
you'd
--
you'd
land
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
textual
commitment
applies
when
somebody
comes
to
the
court
and
asks
for
the
court
to
make
the
decision.
if
the
plaintiff
here
had
come
in
and
--
without
a
congressional
statute
to
rely
upon,
and
had
said,
it
is
--
it
is
wrong
for
the
state
department
not
to
let
me
say
israel
on
my
passport,
then
we
would
say,
you
know,
textually
committed
to
the
executive.
but
this
is
a
different
situation
where
you
have
a
--
a
dispute
between
the
two
branches,
and
where
that
happens,
i
find
it
hard
to
say,
well,
you
know,
we
can't
get
into
it
--
because
why?
because
it's
textually
committed
to
one
of
the
branches?
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
resolve
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
--
i
wanted
to
follow
up
on
that.
does
--
does
that
mean
you're
content
to
have
this
court
not
say
whether
it's
the
exclusive
executive
power
or
there's
some
congressional
participation?
i
mean,
if
we
just
abstain,
if
we
just
say
it's
none
of
our
business,
it's
none
of
our
business;
let
you
two
guys
fight
it
out.
that's
not
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
the
question
that
it
is
exclusively
the
presidential
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
--
you
know,
like
abstaining
because
it's
a
political
question.
it
seems
to
me
like
deciding
thecase.
