mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
recent
decisions
in
medellin
v.
texas
and
in
hamdan
v.
rumsfeld,
this
court
approved
and
applied
the
familiar
tripartite
scheme
that
justice
jackson
articulated
in
the
steel
seizure
case.
when
the
president
takes
measures
incompatible
with
the
express
or
implied
will
of
congress
his
power
is
at
its
lowest
ebb.
in
that
instance,
said
justice
jackson,
his
claim
to
a
power
at
once
so
conclusive
and
preclusive
must
be
scrutinized
with
caution
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
established
by
our
constitutional
system.
mr.
nathan
lewin
justice
kagan,
congress
has
exercised
its
power
over
passport,
the
issuance
of
passports
under
the
immigration,
naturalization
and
foreign
commerce
powers
that
congress
has.
it
has
enacted
passport
legislation
back
in
1856,
in
1926.
it
can
control
what
the
contents
of
a
passport
ought
to
be,
what
its
duration
may
be--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--how
the
application
is
to
be
made.
and
we
say
this
is
an
identification--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--portion
of
the
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
--
and
we
have
cited
i
guess
in
footnote
2
of
our
brief
a
number
of
recent
cases
of
this
court
that
have
said
that
you
take
each
statutory
provision
independently
and
determine
its
constitutionality.
true,
congress
has
a
broader
view
with
regard
to
the
policy
of
jerusalem
being
part
of
israel
than
the
executive
branch
has
had
since
1948.
however,
that
purpose
is
not
determinative
of
what
the
constitutionality
is
of
subsection
(d).
moreover--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--because
--
precisely
because
under
the
standard
of
the
steel
seizure
case
and
this
tripartite
scheme,
if
congress
determines
that
what
the
president
has
done
--
and
this
is
a
statute
which
is
really
very
narrow
and
deals
with
past
conduct
by
the
executive
branch,
as
it
were.
it
does
not
hobble
the
president
in
terms
of
future
foreign
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
foreign
relations
determinations
are
not
left
to
the
president
alone.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
those
are
diplomatic
communications.
in
other,
it's
the
president
who
makes--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
who
issues
the
communication
to
the
foreign
government,
who
determines;
there
are
certain
things
that
the
president
alone
does
because
he's
the
one
who
implements
foreign
policy.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
with
all
respect,
justice
kennedy,
we
don't
think
it's
crabbed.
we
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
justice
jackson
was
referring
to,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
medellin
case
and
--
and
in
hamdan
as
well,
that
if--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
don't
know
whether
it's
limited
to
the
assumption
with
regard
to
the
congressional
statute.
if
congress
says,
as
it
did
in
this
case,
we
disapprove
of
the
state
department's
view
that
passports
should
not
contain
the
--
the
identification
of
israel
for
people
who
were
born
in
jerusalem,
that
is
congress
disapproving
of
what
the
state
department
and
past
state
department--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--policy
has
been.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
he
does
have
to
wait
for
congress
to
change
the
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
but
it
may
in
some
way,
in
a
very
remote
possible
way
--
i
mean,
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
if
there
were
a
peace
treaty
and
if
jerusalem
were
handed
over
to
a
palestinian
state,
i
think
congress
would
repeal
the
statute.
that's
the
point.
congress
has
the
power,
has
the
authority
under
the
constitution
to
enact
laws,
and
it
is
congress
that
makes
the
decision
even
with
regard
to
foreign
policy
issues.
mr.
nathan
lewin
with
all
respect,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
history
demonstrates
that
that's
simply
not
true,
that
in
fact
congress
has
had
equal,
quote,
"recognition
power",
if
in
fact
that's
a
power
rather
than
a
ceremonial
duty.
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
gone
through
the
fact
that
from
presidents
monroe,
jackson,
taylor,
lincoln,
and
even
at
the
time
of
president
mckinley,
congress
said:
we
have
the
authority
to
be
recognized
--
to
recognize.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
it's
in
the
alternative,
justice
kagan;
it
is
both.
we
submit
first
of
all
there
is
no
exclusive
recognition
power
in
the
president,
if
there
is
a
recognition
power,
and
we
spell
that
out.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
say
congress
has
that
authority.
but
i
have
to
add,
justice
ginsburg,
that
congress
has
been
very
careful
in
the
past
and
we
believe
it
will
be
in
the
future
to
give
the
president
broad
authority.
to
the
extent
that
congress
has
tried
to
do
that,
congress
has
consistently
said
that
the
president
can
waive
the
moving
of
the
embassy
to
jerusalem,
because
congress
recognizes
--
this
is
one
of
these
very
rare
situations
where
congress
has
said
what
the
president
has
done
and
what
the
department
of
state
has
done
is
simply
wrong.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
are
not
--
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
determine
what
is
the
better
foreign
policy
position.
congress
has
determined--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
there
is
two
aspects
to
this,
justice
scalia.
one
is
the
recognition
power.
as
to
the
recognition
power,
if
it
exists,
congress
has
it
together
with
the
president.
but
with
regard
to
foreign
policy
and
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
can
trump
the
president,
this
is
not
a
new
proposition.
the
court
determined
it
in
the
steel
seizure
case.
the
court
more
recently
in
--
in
approving
justice
jackson's
tripartite
scheme,
approved
it
in
medellin
v.
texas.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
what
--
again,
what
justice
jackson
said
was
that
when
there
--
the
two
are
incompatible,
then
you
look,
the
court
looks
and
scrutinizes,
"subjects
to
scrutiny"
--
those
words
are
in
justice
jackson's
standard
--
scrutinizes
what
the
president
has
done.
and
we
submit
in
this
case,
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
in
this
case,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
president's
policy,
if
one
scrutinizes
it,
we
say
in
our
brief,
it's
--
we
call
it
trivial,
because
what
happens
is
the
department
of
state
has
said
--
and
again
this
is
important
in
terms
of
this
statute
--
all
that
happens
with
this
statute
is
that
50,000
american
citizens
have
the
same
passport
as
100,000
other
american
citizens
who
were
born
in
tel
aviv
or
haifa.
it
just
says
"israel";
it
doesn't
say
"jerusalem,
israel";
it
just
says
"israel".
and
the
state
department
says
that's
justified
because
arab
countries
or
palestinians
may
be
upset
if
they
misperceive.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
say
it's
a
different
case,
yes,
absolutely.
in
this
case
what
the
--
the
important
thing
about
this
case
and
this
statute
is
that
it
gives
the
individual
passport
holder
a
choice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
a
different
case
because
if
it
were
to
say
"jerusalem,
israel"
there
would
be
more
of
an
argument.
again,
i'm
not
saying
i
would
be
here
acknowledging
that
that's
impermissible.
but
it
would
be
more
of
an
argument
that
it
appears
to
be
some
official
approval
of
jerusalem
being
in
israel.
mr.
nathan
lewin
somewhat
greater
degree.
again--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--no,
i
don't
think
the
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
a
question
of
foreign
policy.
congress
has
decided
that
saying
"israel"
alone
does
not
present
a
foreign
policy
issue.
congress
recognized
that
with
moving
the
embassy
there
might
be
a
foreign
policy
issue,
so
they
said
that
the
president
can
waive
that.
with
regard
to
this
provision,
congress
has
said,
no,
there
is
not
likely
to
be
any
foreign
policy
harm.
and
all
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do
is
it's
being
asked
to
enforce
the
congressional
conclusion,
which
is,
we
submit,
exactly
what
the
third
level
under
justice
jackson's
test
is:
that
if
in
fact
congress
decides
that
what
the
president
has
concluded
or
the
executive
branch
has
concluded
is
wrong,
it
may
--
and
it
has
the
constitutional
power
to
say
--
with
regard
to
foreign
policy,
we
can
exercise
our
determination.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
because
he
says
that
when
it's
in
the
third
category
the
court
has
an
obligation
under
those
circumstances
if
it's
going
to
keep
the
equilibrium
of
the
balance
of
powers,
to
look
at
what
the
president's
justification
is.
the
word
"scrutiny"
is
in
there.
that's
not
just
a
phrase
that
justice
jackson
has
taken
out
of
the
air.
he
says
you
are
supposed
to
scrutinize
it.
and
if
you
scrutinize
it
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
other
than
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
misperception
by
palestinians.
that's
what
the
state
department
is
saying.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
in
the
steel
seizure
case
the
court
was
scrutinizing
whether,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
give
the
president
the
power
to
seize
steel
mills,
nonetheless
whether
there
could
be
some
justification
that,
even
in
contrary
to
congress's
wishes,
the
president
would
be
able
to
exercise
that
power.
mr.
nathan
lewin
possibly
the
claim
that
as
commander
in
chief
in
the
time
of
the
korean
war
he
would
be
able--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--entitled
him
to.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
court
concluded
that
no,
that
did
not
justify
the
exercise
of
the
president's
power
even
though
it
was--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
but
that's
--
that's
an
a
fortiori
situation,
justice
kennedy.
if
if
congress
didn't
even
say
you
may
not
seize
steel
mills,
but
simply
because
they
didn't
give
the
president
affirmatively
the
authority--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
but
the
statute
in
this
case
--
again
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
in
this
case
is
a
passport
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
statute
in
this
case
is
on
its
face
a
passport
statute.
there's
no
reason--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--it's
an
identification.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
you
are
wrong
on
that,
let
me
explain
why.
justice,
and
let
me
explain
why.
because
it
is
clear
from
the
history
of
this
line
on
the
passport
that
it
is
purely
an
identification
of
the
individual;
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
any
foreign
policy.
indeed,
the
passport
statute
itself
says
that
a
passport
is
"any
travel
document
issued
by
competent
authority
showing
the
bearer's
origin,
identity,
and
nationality.
"
and
in
this
case,
the
history
of
this
line
on
the
passport
demonstrates
i
think
conclusively,
and
the
state
department
has
acknowledged
it,
that
it
is
purely
a
means
of
identification.
and
what
congress
has
said
is,
with
regard
to
these
citizens
we
will
permit
them
to
identify
themselves,
like
congress
permitted
the
taiwanese
to
identify
themselves.
mr.
nathan
lewin
not
be
--
justice
alito,
it
is
not
because
there
would
be
an
identification
problem.
but
there
was
--
congress
recognized
that
with
regard
to
the
50,000
people
who
have
a
passport
that
says
"jerusalem",
they
are
being
denied
a
certain
sense
of
self-respect
that
they
feel
they
should
be
able
to
have
in
terms
of
their
own
identification.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
create
some
political
brouhaha
or
make
a
foreign
policy
statement.
it's
a
statute
that
frankly
fits
in
with
what
the
state
department
does
in
accommodating
to
individual
passport
holders.
the
state
department
says
if
you
are
a
palestinian
or
an
arab
and
you
are
born
in
haifa
and
you
don't
like
seeing
"israel"
in
your
passport,
we
will
allow
you
to
eliminate
"israel"
from
your
passport.
and
all
that
congress
has
said
is--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
think
that
what
you
said
the
statute
doesn't
say,
justice
kagan,
is
exactly
what
the
statute
does
say.
the
statute
does
say
that
the
individual
passport
holder
can
choose
to
say
israel
or
can
keep
it
as
jerusalem,
and
if
he's
born
before
1948
he
can
say
palestine.
so
it
is
an
individual
choice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
--
i
guess
it's
a
reflection
on
my
own
seniority
that
--
it's
my
generation
that
fits
into
that.
but
--
but
the
fact
is
exactly;
our
point
is
that
that's
all
that
the
statute
does.
the
statute
is
a
means
of
permitting
self-identification
by
an
american
citizen
who
says:
my
birth
in
jerusalem,
indeed
in
west
jerusalem,
which
has
always
been
recognized
as
a
part
of
israel,
i
want
to
call
--
i
want
my
passport
to
say
"israel".
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
an
american
citizen
born
in
taiwan
apparently
does
have
that
option,
even
the
though
the
united
states
says
we
don't
recognize
taiwan
as
an
independent
country.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no,
it's
not
just
because.
it's
because
what
happens
is
there
is
a
recognition
in
both
cases
that
it
is
a
personal
identification
choice
with
regard
to
what
goes
on
the
passport.
sure,
in
that
case
the
state
department
didn't
take
it
to
litigation,
although
i
submit
that
had
they
chosen
to
litigate
that
case
they
would
have
a
stronger
position
than
they
have
in
this
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
have
to
say
that,
given
this
court's
view
about
congress's
power
with
regard
to
a-passports
--
and
again,
i
go
back
to
the
fact
that
in
zemel
and
rusk,
in
haig
and
agee,
in
kent
v.
dulles,
in
all
these
passport
cases
this
court
said
we
look
to
see
whether
what
the
president
does
is
authorized
by
congress,
whether
implicitly
or
otherwise.
so
that,
i
submit,
that
with
regard
to
passports
you
need
the
congressional
authority,
whether
it's
implicit
or
express.
and
with
regard
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
yes,
congress
could
in
its
exercise
of
its
passport
authority
say:
here
is
what
the
passport
has
to
say.
it
would
be
a
foolish
statute.
but
this
court
has
said,
and
i
think
you,
justice
scalia,
have
said
it
many
times,
it's
not
the
court's
job
to
determine
whether
congress
is
foolish
or
not.
if
congress
decides
that,
look,
somebody
born
in
israel,
a
passport
should
say
"israel,
the
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east.
"
congress
can
say
that.
congress
has
passport
authority.
and
this--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--and
this
has
to
do
with
the
contents
of
the
passport.
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
view
is
it's
not
a
political
question
because
it
is
like
many
other
questions
that
affect
foreign
policy.
and
the
court
said
in
baker
and
carr,
not
every
decision
that
touches
on
foreign
affairs
or
foreign
policy
is
a
political
question
that
can't
be
determined.
it
--
it
--
arguably,
according
to
the
government,
this
affects
foreign
policy.
we
say
it
is
simply
congress
having
passed
a
statute
which
either
is
unconstitutional
--
we
say
it
is
constitutional
--
either
is
unconstitutional
or
the
court
should
simply
enforce
it,
like
in
the
japan
whaling
case.
in
the
japan
whaling
case,
this
court
rejected
the
claim
that
the
outcome
of
a
determination
by
the
court
might
very
well
affect
foreign
relations
and
said
it's
not
a
political
question.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
my
rebuttal
by
echoing
really
what
justice
alito
said
during
my
colleague's
argument.
the
question
is
whether
anything
that
the
president
thinks
bears
on
recognition,
it
forecloses
this
court
or
any
court
from
making
that
determination?
this
is
not
in
our
view
a
recognition
case.
this
is
a
passport
case.
the
question
is,
what
goes
on
the
passport,
and
may
somebody
self-identify?
this
is
again,
if
one
looks
at
the
statute,
if
one
even
looks
at
the
foreign
affairs
manual,
a
passport
is
not
today
considered
a
diplomatic
statement,
it's
an
identification
of
a
person
in
order
to
enable
him
to
travel
abroad.
now
again,
let
me
also
echo
what
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kagan
asked
during
my
colleague's
argument.
if
in
fact
the
statute
had
said
we
don't
say
jerusalem
is
part
of
israel,
but
you
can
identify
yourself
as
being
in
israel,
my
--
we
submit
that
result
can
very
easily
be
achieved
and
was
achieved
in
the
case
of
taiwan
by
a
public
statement
by
the
executive.
congress
--
this
law
can
be
enacted;
people
who
were
born
in
jerusalem
can
have
their
passport
say
either
jerusalem
or
israel,
that's
their
choice;
congress
hasn't
said
it
has
to
say
israel,
and
then
the
department
of
state
can
issue
as
it
did
in
the
case
of
taiwan,
a
public
statement
saying,
this
is
not
official
american
policy.
nobody's
asking
this
court
to
decide
what
is
official
american
policy.
nobody
is
asking
the
court
to
decide
what
as
justice
scalia
said
would
happen
if
there
were
no
congressional
statute.
in
that
case
it
would
be
a
political
question.
if
my
client
had
decided
he
wanted
to
have
his
passport
say
israel
and
he
had
no
congressional
stature,
and
we
brought
the
case
to
a
court,
the
court
could
say,
no,
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
what
the
president
should
decide,
what
the
department
of
state
should
decide.
but
other
than
that,
congress
has
enacted
the
law.
the
--
the
fact
is
that
with
regard
to
this
legislation
it
is
a
statute
which
determines
personal
choice
with
regard
to
a
passport.
the
case
can
be
a
vehicle
--
this
case
can
be
a
vehicle
for
an
authoritative
clarification
of
the
roles
of
congress
and
the
president
in
conducting
the
nation's
foreign
affairs.
if
so,
then
we
submit
justice
jackson's
statement,
which
acknowledges
that
congress
has
the
final
word
in
the
third
category,
is
one
that
should
control.
but
there
are
narrower
grounds
for
enforcing
section
214(d)
that
do
not
implicate
separation
of
powers
issues.
it's
a
passport
law;
it's
within
congress's
constitutional
authority
on
the
cases
that
have
recognized
that
the
president
may
not
deny
or
restrict
passports
without
the
express
or
implied
approval
of
congress.
that
doesn't
require
the
recognition
or
involve
the
recognition
of
foreign
sovereigns.
and
the
state
department's
justification
for
a
policy
that
congress
has
disapproved
does
not
--
withstand
--
scrutiny.
the
court
merely
has
to
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
in
which
the
state
department
has
said,
look,
we're
concerned
that
there
may
be
a
misperception
of
what
this
means
--
a
misperception.
and
it's
extraordinary
that
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
alleged
misperception,
american
citizens
who
have
been
authorized
by
congress
to
say
--
identify
themselves
on
their
passports
as
being
born
in
israel,
will
now
find
that
statute
null
and
void.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
congress
has
to
weigh
that;
and
if
congress
determines
that
in
any
event
this
is
what
the
passport
should
say,
then
that
is
congress--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--well,
in
this
case--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--i
--
i
don't
think
that's
true,
because--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--in
the
end,
if
congress
determines
that
what
the
president
has
said
in
this
context
is
wrong,
yes.
we
live
in
a
system
under
which
congress
passes
the
law,
and
the
president
has
the
duty
--
and
i
think
justice
scalia
has
said
it,
has
the
duty
to
be
the
sole
instrument
of
foreign
policy.
the
president
speaks
for
the
foreign
policy
that
--
when
congress
authorizes
him
to
do
it,
he
may
formulate
it.
when
congress
does
not
authorize
him
to
do
it,
he
may
formulate
it.
but
when
congress
disapproves
of
what
he
does,
then
under
justice
jackson's
test
in
the
steel
seizure
case,
congress
prevails.
the
fact
that
there
is
dictum
in
cases
--
particularly
curtiss-wright,
which
has
not
come
up
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
but
justice
sutherland's
opinion
in
the
curtiss-wright
case
in
which
he
spoke
broadly
of
the
president
as
being
the
sole
organ
of
foreign
policy,
one
has
to
say
that
the
harvard
professor
thomas
reed
powell,
who
used
to
tell
his
students
that
just
because
justice
sutherland
writes
clearly,
you
must
not
suppose
that
he
thinks
clearly.
[laughter]
and
we
submit
that
is
really
what
it's
all
about.
mr.
nathan
lewin
correct.
the
--
historians
who
studied
that
have
determined
that
he
was
just
following
mr.
vattel,
who
said
you
had
have
to
recognize
any
country
that
has
de
facto
control,
and
therefore,
since
the
french
revolutionists
were
in
de
facto
control
of
the
french
government,
washington
had
no
choice.
he
was
not
exercising
any
kind
of
discretion.
