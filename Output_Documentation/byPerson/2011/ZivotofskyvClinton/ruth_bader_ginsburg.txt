justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say,
mr.
lewin,
that
--
you
are
not
claiming
exclusivity
in
congress.
you
say
foreign
relations
is
a
shared
power.
so
if
it
is
a
shared
power,
why
does
congress
trump
the
executive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
go
the
full
length
of
saying
if
congress
passed
a
law
that
says
the
united
states
recognizes
jerusalem
as
the
capital
of
israel
and
jerusalem
must
be
designated
as
the
capital
of
israel
in
all
official
documents
--
suppose
that
were
the
law.
i
take
it
from
everything
you
have
argued
your
position
would
be
yes,
congress
has
that
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
all
that
old.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
lewin,
what
you've
argued
is
that
you
are
skipping
over
the
question
that
the
d.c.
circuit
decided.
i
take
it
your
view
is
it's
not
a
political
question,
so
the
court
should
resolve
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
two
examples
you
are
given
in
the
brief,
one
of
texas,
where
petitioner
says
there
was
a
case
where
congress
went
for
--
congress
recognized
and
the
president
acquiesced,
and
the
same
thing
with
taiwan;
it
was
a
statute
and
the
president
implemented
it.
so
congress
thought
it
had
the
authority,
the
recognition
authority,
in
those
two
measures
and
the
president
acquiesced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
all
the
way?
i
mean,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
constitution
commits
this
authority
exclusively
to
the
president,
then
it's
all
over.
that's
the
merits
of
the
case:
does
the
president
have
this
authority?
so
the
political
question
label
seems
to
be
kind
of
a
--
a
substitute
because
if
there
is
a
textual
commission,
commitment
to
the
president,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
mister
--
general
verrilli,
then
you
are
taking
the
position
that
this
is
not
a
shared
authority;
it's
an
exclusive
authority;
that
there
is
no
role
for
congress.
am
i
right?
or
is
there
some
role
in
recognition
for
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
is
--
that
presents
a
merits
determination.
the
whole
question
is
who
has
the
authority.
and
whatever
label
you
put
on
it,
if
you
decide
that
the
president
has,
as
you
just
said,
the
exclusive
authority,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
it's
--
it's
not
leaving
it
--
it
is
not
leaving
it,
as
justice
breyer
said,
to
the
political
branches
to
fight
it
out
between
them.
it
is
saying
the
president
has
the
exclusive
authority.
