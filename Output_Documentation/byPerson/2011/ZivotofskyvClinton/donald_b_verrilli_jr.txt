mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
executive
has
determined
that
the
passports
it
issues
should
not
identify
israel
as
the
place
of
birth
for
persons
born
in
jerusalem.
petitioner
seeks
relief
under
section
214(d)
that
would
countermand
that
executive
judgment.
but
under
the
constitution
that
is
an
exercise
of
the
executive's
exclusive
recognition
power.
the
constitution
commits
that
power
exclusively
to
the
executive
and
neither
a
court
nor
the
congress
can
override
that
judgment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
spend
a
minute
or
two
on
that
history,
because
i
don't
think
it
shows
what
my
friend
suggests
that
it
does.
before
getting
to
the
starting
point
of
that
story,
which
i
think
is
the
monroe
administration,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
washington
administration
the
president
confronted
the
question
with
respect
to
whether
to
recognize
the
revolutionary
government
of
france.
and
president
washington
consulted
with
his
cabinet,
and
of
course
his
cabinet
included
jefferson
and
madison
and
hamilton
and
jay.
and
they
decided
that
this
was
a
power
that
was
exclusive
to
the
president
to
such
an
extent
that
they
didn't
even
need
to
send
a
message
to
the
congress
that
they
were
going
to
recognize
the
new
revolutionary
government
in
france.
now,
the
second
fact
i
think
is
critical
as
a
matter
of
history
is
that
there
is
not
a
single
piece
of
legislation
that
has
passed
both
houses
of
congress
and
come
to
the
president
purporting
to
recognize
a
foreign
nation
or
territorial
boundary
of
a
foreign
nation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
an
instance
of
congress's
sustained
objection.
i
think
probably
the
closest
we
would
come
is
the
revolutionary
government
of
mexico,
which
president
wilson
first
recognized
on
a
de
facto
basis
in
1915
and
a
de
jure
basis
in
1917.
congress
indicated
displeasure
with
that.
president
wilson
sent
his
message
to
congress
saying
that
this
is
an
exclusive
executive
function.
congress
backed
down.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
yes,
i
will
answer
that
question
directly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
is
true
that
the
court
has
never
before,
with
respect
to
the
recognition
power,
confronted
the
question
of
whether
the
president
is
free
to
act
in
a
manner
different
than
a
congressional
command
because
congress
has
never
purported
to
issue
a
command.
that
does
not
mean,
however,
that
my
friend
is
correct
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
the
authority
to
countermand
or
direct
the
decision
of
the
president.
this
is,
we
submit
--
even
if
one
thinks
about
this
as
a
youngstown
category
three
case,
this
is
a
youngstown
category
three
case
of
the
kind
that
justice
jackson
identified
in
footnote
4,
where
he
cited
myers
v.
the
united
states.
the
kind
of
case
in
category
three
of
youngstown,
in
which
the
president's
judgment
can
prevail
even
over
a
contrary
judgment
of
congress,
is
a
case
in
which
the
president
has
exclusive
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
let
me--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so,
i
do
think,
if
i
could
--
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
answering
your
question,
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
return
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
history.
moving
beyond
that
initial
recognition
by
washington
that
this
is
an
exclusive
power,
which
i
think
is
quite
significant,
when
we
get
to
the
monroe
administration
there
is
a
fight
between
clay
and
monroe
about
whether
the
president
has
exclusive
authority
to
recognize
the
new
south
american
republics.
now,
a
couple
of
points
there.
i
think
the
--
what
--
the
only
thing
that
one
could
point
to
as
an
action
by
the
congress
that
even
implicates
the
recognition
power
is
one
house
of
congress
passed
an
appropriations
measure
for
an
ambassador.
what
the
--
the
history
treatise,
the
global
treatise
that
my
friend
cites
says
on
page
133,
the
very
page
that
he
cites
in
his
reply
brief,
is
that
clay's
effort
to
contest
the
president's
exclusive
authority
came
to
a,
quote,
"inglorious
end,
unquote".
he
then
goes
on
to
say
--
my
friend
goes
on
to
say:
well,
but
a
year
later
when
president
monroe
sought
to
actually
recognize
these
south
american
republics
he
asked
--
he
asked
the
congress
to
join
him
in
it.
what
he
asked
congress
for
was
an
appropriation
for
an
ambassador.
but
it
was
not
the
sending
of
an
ambassador
to
the
republic
of
columbia
that
was
the
recognition.
it
was
when
president
monroe
received
an
ambassador
from
columbia
that
constituted
the
recognition,
and
that
was
an
exclusive
act
that
he
undertook
without
any
consultation
with
congress.
now--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
would
like
to
address
texas
because
i
do
think
that's
probably
the
most
significant
example
that
my
friend's
identified.
but
even
there,
i
think
if
one
works
through
the
history
we'll
see
that's
it's
an
exclusive
executive
power.
president
jackson,
in
his
first
letter
in
1836
to
the
congress
says
essentially:
i
hear
you;
you
think
you
we
should
recognize
texas.
and
then
he
says:
it's
an
open
question
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
whether
there
is
exclusive
authority
or
not.
it's
not
been
something
that
the
legislature
has
ever
studied,
but
as
a
matter
of
expediency,
he
says,
we
don't
need
to
resolve
that
question,
because
i
want
to
work
with
you.
he
then
goes
on
to
caution
the
congress
to
not
move
too
quickly
for
fear
of
precipitating
war
with
mexico,
which
i
think,
justice
breyer,
i
will
try
to
return
to
a
functional
analysis
later,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
then
--
i
think
what
is
important,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
what
congress
did
next,
as
to
pass
two
appropriations
measures,
one
in
the
house,
one
in
the
senate.
each
of
those
measures
appropriates
funds
for
an
emissary
to
the
republic
of
texas,
but
each
includes
language
that
says:
at
such
time
that
the
president
determines
that
it's
appropriate
to
do
so.
if
one
looks
at
the
page
in
the
congressional
globe
that
my
friend
cites,
one
will
see
that
that
language
was
added
because
as
originally
introduced
the
appropriations
riders
were
objected
to
by
members
of
the
congress
on
the
ground
that
they
infringed
on
the
president's
exclusive
recognition
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
isn't
a
very
great
deal
of
difference.
we
acknowledge
that
in
conducting
the
political
question
analysis
that
it
is
for
the
court
do
decide
whether
there
is
a
textual
commitment
to
the
executive;
it
is
for
the
court
to
decide
the
scope.
we
think
that's
what
nixon
v.
the
united
states
says;
it's
what
powell
v.
mccormack
says;
and
that
in
answering
those
questions
we
think
that
the
court
will
have
gone
a
very
long
way
to
determining
the
question
of
the
constitution--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
the
--
i
do
think
that
with
respect
to
the
first
baker
v.
carr
factor,
textual
commitment
is
a
factor
that
the
court
has
indicated
is
one
that
can
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
a
political
question.
i
do
think
that
the
court
has
to
go
through
the
analysis.
and
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
may
not
be
very
much
of
a
difference--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
justice
alito,
we
don't
--
we
think
powell
v.
mccormick
and
nixon
say
that
the
question
of
--
not
just
the
question
of
commitment,
but
also
the
question
of
scope,
are
questions
for
the
court
to
decide.
now,
we
do
think,
with
respect
to
the
question
here
that,
even
though
it's
for
the
court
to
decide,
it's
for
the
court
to
decide
with
a
very
significant
measure
of
deference,
because
when
--
the
decision
by
the
executive
with
respect
to
how
it's
going
to
handle
the
status
of
jerusalem
in
passports
is
a
very
sensitive
and
delicate
matter.
this
position
was
arrived
at
after
very
careful
thought
and
it
is
enforced
very
carefully.
and
i
think
from
that
should
come
the
lesson
that
this
judge
--
and
the
reason
is
because
the
executive
believes
that
the
statement
on
the
passport
has
to
be
understood
as
a
manifestation
of
the
president's
exercise
of
the
recognition
power.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
analysis,
justice
kagan.
i
--
i
think
--
of
course,
that
is
not
this
statute,
which
has
a
title
which
says
"united
states
policy
with
respect
to
jerusalem
as
the
capital
of
israel.
"
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
still
think
that
would
be
within
the
scope
of
the
executive's
power
to
decide
because
the
content
of
the
passport
insofar
as
the
executive
believes
that
it
constitutes
an
expression
of
--
of,
an
incident
of
recognition,
is
a
judgment
that
the
executive
makes.
now,
the
court
can
review
that,
but
the
court's
review
of
it
should
be
done
with
a
significant
measure
of
deference
as
the
court
suggested
in
regan
v.
wald--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
we--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
we
think
--
we
do
think
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
the
president
wins.
but
we
do
think
that
the
d.c.
circuit
acted
appropriately
in
finding
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
we
appreciate
that,
justice
kennedy.
we
do
think
that
in
resolving
a
political
question
--
in
conducting
the
political
question
analysis,
the
questions
that
the
court
would
need
to
decide
under
nixon
and
powell
would
go
a
very
long
way
to
clarifying
that
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
changes
the
analysis,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
that
the
--
to
the
--
because
it
would
--
that
would
be
again
congress
seeking
to
direct
a
judgment
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
--
what
the
united
states
says
about
that
in
official
communications
--
and
remember,
a
passport
is
not
a
communication
by
the
passport
holder.
it's
an
official
united
states
document
that
communicates
the
position
of
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
same
problem,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
do
think
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
executive's
got
to
make
the
judgment
because
it's
of
paramount
importance
that
the
nation
speak
with
one
voice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
our
position,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
recognition
power
is
exclusive
to
the
president.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that's
a
situation
in
which
the
president
would
exercise
that
recognition
power
very
carefully--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
--
although
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
think
that
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
president
would
exercise
a
recognition
power,
but
if
--
but
if
the
president
did,
it's
the
president's
judgment
to
make.
and
i
--
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
get
back
to
your
question,
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i
think
with
respect
to
the
question
of
recognition,
justice
scalia,
that
it
is
a
power
that
rests
with
the
executive.
and
i
think
in
addition
to
the
history
--
in
that
we
do
now
in
220-plus
years
in
our
constitution,
do
not
have
a
single
example
of
congress
actually
exercising
the
power
--
and
i
think
in
addition
to
the
history,
there
are
very
good
functional
reasons
why
that
is
so.
and
i
think,
justice
breyer,
in
answering
your
earlier
question,
i
think
those
are
significant.
the
exercise
of
the
recognition
power
depends,
we
think,
on
three
things
that
make
it
clear
that
it
needs
to
be
exclusive.
the
first
is
timing;
the
second
is
expertise;
and
the
third
is
a
need
for
secrecy.
timing--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
need
for
secrecy.
timing
is,
i
think
the
israel
example
shows,
is
of
critical
importance.
but
it's
not
just
speed.
of
course,
congress
can't
act
with
the
dispatch
needed
in
a
situation
like
the
recognition
of
israel.
but
the
--
but
apart
from
that,
recognition
--
a
recognition
that
occurs
too
soon
could
send
events
in
the
direction
that
could
be
very
disadvantageous
to
our
foreign
policy.
a
recognition
that
comes
too
late
could
--
could
squander
an
important
opportunity
in
the
national
interest
in
the
foreign
policy
realm.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so
--
here's
our
position
on
that,
justice
kagan.
we
do
think
that
the
reception
clause
is
the
source
of
the
recognition
power.
hamilton
identified
it
as
the
source
of
the
recognition
power
in
the
washington
administration.
i
think
it's
now
understood
that
it's
hornbook
law
that
that's
the
textual
source
--
but
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
is
there.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
i
would
say
in
addition
--
i
would
say
in
addition,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
question,
we
do
think,
as
i
think
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
that
--
that
one
can
see
this
power
as
part
of
what
the
court
in
garamendi
described
as
the
vast
share
of
responsibility
that
the
constitution
assigns
to
the
executive.
now,
we
don't
think
all
of
that
shared
responsibility
is
exclusive
to
the
executive
--
but
we
think
this
responsibility
is
exclusive--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
the
reception
clause
were
not
in
the
constitution
--
but
we
had
the
same
history
that
we
have
now
and
the
same
functional
considerations
about
the
need
for
it
being
in
the
control
of
the
executive,
yes,
we
would.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
--
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
difference
between
--
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
congress
has
authority
over
appropriations.
congress
has
authority
to
appoint
ambassadors.
it's
entitled
to
exercise
that
authority,
and
it's
entitled
to
exercise
that
authority
even
if
it's
intentioned
with
the
president's
recognition
decision.
it
is
the
position
of
the
executive
though
that
there
could
be
circumstances
in
which
congress
could
try
to
exercise
its
appropriations
authority
in
a
way
that
would
preclude
the
executive
from
exercising
its
--
its
recognition
power,
and
that
--
the
executive
would
--
would
in
some
circumstances
believe
that
it
had
the
authority
to
move
ahead
despite
those
actions
by
congress.
but
of
course,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
passed
a
sense
of
the
congress
resolution
about
what
it
thinks.
it's
not
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
exercised
attaching
conditions
to
its
spending
power
about
what
private
parties
do.
this
is
an
effort
by
congress
to
regulate
the
content
of
a
passport,
which,
as
the
court
recognized
in
haig
v.
agee,
is
a
core
instrument
of
diplomatic
communication.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
the
--
the
entire
content
of
passports
is
an
exclusive
power.
i
would
--
and
i
will
explain,
justice
alito,
where
we
think
the
line
is.
but
before
doing
so,
i
want
to
push
back
a
little
bit
on
the
notion
that
congress
has
for
a
long
time
exercised
authority
over
the
content
of
passport
the.
the
first
passport
act
was
in
1856.
what
this
court
said
in
haig
v.
agee
was
that
the
enactment
of
that
statute
merely
confirmed
a
power
that
everyone
understood
to
be
inherent
in
the
executive.
that
statute
did
not
purport
to
regulate
the
content
of
passports.
it
in
fact
said
that
passports
shall
be
issued
under
such
rules
as
the
president
shall
proscribe.
and
--
and
in
haig,
that
was
that
language
i
think
that
led
the
court
to
conclude
that
this
was
a
confirmation
of
the
executive's
authority,
and
an
action
in
aid
of
that
authority.
now--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
we
do
think
--
that's
--
that's
what
--
we
think
that
the
appropriate
inquiry
for
political
question
purposes
is
into
the
relief
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking.
and
if
the
relief
the
petitioner
is
seeking
would
invade
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
the
constitution
commits
exclusively
to
the
executive,
and
the
reason
it
commits
these
kind
of
judgments
exclusively
to
the
executive
is
because
this
is
a
situation
in
which
multifarious
voices
are
inimical
to
the
national
interest.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
think
in
--
in
--
let
me
try
to
put
it
this
way,
justice
ginsburg:
in
the
absence
of
section
214,
i
think
it
would
be
clear
from
pink
and
belmont
that
this
--
that
the
judgment
on
recognition
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
executive,
and
it
would
be
a
political
question,
if
a
party
came
in
and
said
i
want
my
passport
to
say
something
different
about
jerusalem
than
it
says--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
it's
actually
quite
narrow,
and
the
problem
isn't
a
significant
one
in
the
case
of
textual
commitment,
because
the
court
does
in
reaching
the
conclusion,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
did,
that
it's
a
political
question
the
court
does
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
textual
commitment
to
the
executive
here,
so
the
court
would
resolve
that
question.
the
court
would
resolve
that
question
of
whether
the
conduct
at
issue
here
is
within
the
scope
of
that
textual
commitment.
so
the
court
would
issue
those
rulings.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
--
i
didn't
mean
that
it
it
wouldn't
be
a
textual
commitment.
it
would
be
--
would
be
a
commitment
that
one
would
read
as
the
historical
gloss
on
the
vesting
power,
which
is
what
--
garamendi
said.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
the
historical
gloss
on
the
vesting
power
is
--
functions
as
has
the
equivalent
of
the
specific
textual
commitment.
of
course,
we
do
have
the
specific
textual
commitment
here,
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
tried
to
say,
we
think
that
the
--
the
announcement
of
the
political
question
doctrine
goes
a
very
long
way
towards
answering
that
question,
justice
scalia.
we
do
think
this
could
be
seen
as
a
case
like
gilligan
in
looking
at
the
relief
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking,
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
leads
the
court
to
conclude
that
this
--
that
--
that
entertaining
the
claim
would
embroil
the
court
in
decisions
that
are
supposed
to
be
made
by
another
branch;
and
that
in
fact,
i
think
you
can
understand
section
214(d)
as
precisely
that,
an
effort
to
try
to
draw
the
court
into
this
dispute
between
congress
and
the
executive
over
whether
section
--
over
whether
jerusalem
should
be
recognized
as
part
of
israel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
it's
what
we
are
asking
you
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
--
we
do
think
that
the
--
whether
the
court
is
looking
at
it
as
a
political
question
or
whether
the
court
is
looking
at
it
as
a
judgment
of
the
merits,
the
issue
is
textual
commitment.
this
is
--
there
is
textual
commitment.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
country
has
to
speak
with
one
voice,
and
the
executive
has
determined
what
the
country
should
say.
thank
you.
