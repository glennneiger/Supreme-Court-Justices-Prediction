chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
10-699,
zivotofsky
v.
clinton.
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
were
suggesting
that
the
outcome
of
this
if
congress
said
jerusalem
is
rea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
--
why
is
it
a
different
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
would
there
be
--
there
would
be
a
greater
concern
--
the
concern
on
the
part
of
the
executive
that
there
would
be
adverse
political
reaction
would
have
a
greater
degree
of
credibility?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
are
supposed
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
executive
is
correct
in
saying
that
it's
a
significant
problem.
and
he
says,
well,
he
says
that,
but
we
know
foreign
policy
better;
we
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
a
big
deal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
justice
jackson's
analysis
--
what
he's
saying,
and
i
guess
i
don't
think
it's
as
controlling
as
others
might.
he's
saying
when
there
is
a
conflict
it's
a
harder
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
there's
--
when
they
agree
it's
an
easy
case.
when
you
can't
tell
it's
sort
of
a
middle
case.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
very
helpful
in
resolving
the
dispute
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
recognizing
that
principle
only
with
respect
to
a
particular
jurisdiction.
an
american
citizen
born
in
northern
ireland
doesn't
have
this
option,
because
he
thinks
it's
a
part
of
ireland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
--
and
your
friend
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
says
that's
because
of
a
state
department
judgment
that
in
one
situation
it's
significant,
in
the
other
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
lewin.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
friend
documented
contrary
history
at
some
length
in
his
reply
brief,
where
from
the
beginning
at
least
as
he
says
through
the
mckinley
administration,
the
two
branches
acted
as
if
they
had
co-equal
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
i
could
just
stop
you
and
just
have
you
address
the
political
question
doctrine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
this
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
president
and
therefore
it
is
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
how
is
that
different
from
saying,
it's
our
job
to
decide
cases,
it
is
justiciable,
and
then
you
can
argue
that
the
answer
of
that
analysis
is
that
it
is
exclusively
committed
to
the
president?
i
don't
understand
why
labeling
it
a
political
question
advances
the
analysis
much.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
congress's
statute
said:
what
you
must
put
on
the
passport,
if
requested,
is
"israel",
parentheses,
"disputed",
close
parentheses,
which
would
seem
to
take
care
of
your
objection
that
people
are
going
to
look
at
this
and
draw
a
false
conclusion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
the
position
of
the
administration,
isn't
it,
that
the
status
of
jerusalem
is
disputed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
congress
says
in
the
place
that
you
have
it:
this
person
has
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
put
jerusalem
or
israel.
this
doesn't
affect
whether
the
united
states
recognizes
jerusalem
as
part
of
israel
or
not;
it's
just
his
choice.
same
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
someone's
going
to
look
at
that
and
say:
that
offends
me,
that
you
are
calling
this
part
of
israel.
that
was
the
foreign
policy
significance.
and
i
tried
to
give
you
a
hypothetical
in
which
nobody
could
reasonably
draw
that
conclusion,
and
you
say
still,
same
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
you
told--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
told
--
you
told
justice
kagan
it
didn't
--
your
position
didn't
depend
upon
a
textual
commitment,
that
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
receive
ambassadors
clause
were
not
in
the
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
sounds
to
me
like
not
in
the
text.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
will
give
you
a
couple
more
minutes.
if
my
colleagues
have
any
questions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lewin,
we
will
give
you
6
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
10-699,
zivotofsky
versus
clinton.
in
2002,
congress
passed
a
law
providing
that
an
american
citizen
born
in
jerusalem
may
choose
to
have
his
place
of
birth
listed
as
israel
on
his
passport.
menachem
binyamin
zivotofsky
was
born
in
jerusalem
shortly
after
the
law
went
into
effect.
he
was
an
american
citizen
because
his
parents
were.
his
mother
applied
for
a
passport
for
her
son
and
said
she
wanted
israel
listed
as
his
place
of
birth
as
the
law
allowed.
the
state
department
refused
her
request
and
issued
the
boy
a
passport
listing
only
jerusalem
as
his
place
of
birth.
it
was
and
remains
state
department
policy
not
to
follow
the
statute
allowing
israel
to
be
listed
as
the
place
of
birth
on
the
ground
that
the
law
interferes
with
the
president's
foreign
affairs
power.
zivotofsky's
sued
the
secretary
of
state
in
federal
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
secretary
responded
that
the
court
should
stay
out
of
the
matter,
arguing
that
it
presented
a
political
question
beyond
the
authority
of
the
judicial
branch
to
decide.
the
lower
courts
agreed
with
that
position.
we
granted
zivotofsky's
petition
for
review
and
now
reverse.
in
general,
of
course,
the
judiciary
has
a
responsibility
to
decide
cases
properly
before
it
even
those,
as
chief
justice
marshall
put
it
200
years
ago,
that
it
would
gladly
avoid.
our
precedence
however,
recognized
a
narrow
exception
to
that
rule
known
as
a
political
question
doctrine.
under
that
doctrine,
a
court
lacks
the
authority
to
decide
a
case
if
it,
one,
involves
a
question
that
the
constitution
has
clearly
committed
to
another
branch
to
decide
or
two,
if
there
are
no
judicially
manageable
standards
for
courts
to
use
in
deciding
it.
the
lower
courts
thought
that
zivotofsky's
case
presented
such
a
political
question
because
it
asked
the
courts
to
decide
the
political
status
of
jerusalem,
but
it
does
not
do
that.
the
question
for
the
court
to
decide
is
instead
whether
the
state
department
is
required
to
follow
the
2002
law
that
gives
zivotofsky
the
right
to
have
israel
recorded
as
his
place
of
birth.
the
secretary
of
state
argues
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
there
is
in
the
constitution
an
exclusive
commitment
to
the
president
of
the
power
to
recognize
foreign
governments,
but
there
is
no
such
exclusive
commitment
to
the
executive
of
the
authority
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
zivotofsky
claims
that
the
law
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
own
powers.
deciding
which
party
is
correct
is
well
within
our
authority
and,
as
we
put
it
in
one
of
our
prior
cases,
we
cannot
avoid
the
duty
to
decide
such
a
question
simply
because
the
issues
have
political
implications.
in
addition,
there
is
no
absence
of
judicially
manageable
standards
for
resolving
this
case.
both
zivotofskys
and
the
secretary
of
state
offered
detailed,
textual,
structural,
and
historical
arguments
about
the
constitutionality
of
this
law.
evaluating
those
arguments
is
a
familiar
judicial
exercise.
for
these
reasons
we
hold
that
the
lower
courts
should
not
have
avoided
deciding
this
case
because
in
their
view
it
presented
a
political
question.
given
that
error,
the
lower
courts
never
reached
the
merits
of
zivotofsky's
claim.
we
generally
do
not
decide
questions
that
were
not
decided
below.
we,
therefore,
send
the
case
back
to
the
lower
courts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
the
merits
of
zivotofsky's
claim
in
the
first
instance.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
and
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
breyer
joined
as
to
part
one.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
