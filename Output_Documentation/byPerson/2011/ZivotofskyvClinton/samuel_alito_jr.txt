what--
justice
samuel

--do
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--do
you
think
it's
relevant
that
the
title
of
section
214
is
"united
states
policy
with
respect
to
jerusalem
as
the
capital
of
israel?
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
congress
enacted
this
because
they
thought
that
if
these
individuals'
passports
simply
said
"jerusalem"
there
would
be
an
identification
problem?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
there
ever
been
an
instance
in
which
the
president
has
recognized
a
foreign
government
over
congress's
sustained
objection?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
depend
on
what
the
question
is.
in
order
to
decide
whether
it's
a
political
question,
you
have
to
identify
the
question.
now,
if
the
question
is
whether
the
president
has
exclusive
authority
with
respect
to
the
formal
recognition
of
a
foreign
country
that
might
be
one
thing.
but
what
if
the
question
is
whether
the
president
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
respect
--
has
plenary
authority,
unreviewable
authority,
with
respect
to
anything
that
the
president
thinks
has
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
recognition.
now,
if
that's
the
question,
is
that
committed
exclusively
to
the
president?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
many
things
that
congress
could
do
to
frustrate
the
president's
decision
to
recognize
another
country.
now,
would
you
say
all
of
those
are
unconstitutional?
they
all
infringe
the
president's
exclusive
recognition
authority?
suppose
the
president
decides
to
recognize
a
country
and
congress
refuses
to
appropriate
any
money
for
an
embassy
there,
or
refuses
to
confirm
any
u.s.
ambassador
to
that
country.
those
presumably
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
would
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
--
do
you
think
that's
an
exclusive
power,
to
--
to
determine
of
the
contents
of
passports?
hasn't
congress
exercised
that
authority
for
a
long
time?
