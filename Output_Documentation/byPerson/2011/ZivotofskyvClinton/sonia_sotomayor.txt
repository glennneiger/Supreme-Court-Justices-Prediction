mr.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
lewin,
you
were
cut
off
earlier
when
you
were
saying
this
reading
doesn't
hobble
the
president
in
the
future.
it
says
anybody
born
in
--
in
jerusalem
can
have
israel
listed,
correct?
what
happens
if
there
is
a
peace
accord
tomorrow,
and
israel
gives
up
any
claim
to
sovereignty
over
jerusalem?
is
the
president
free
to
stop
listing
israel
on
the
passport?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
does
he
have
to
wait
for
congress
to
change
the
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
hobbling
the
president
with
respect
to
situations
that
occur
frequently--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
happened
in
egypt,
sometimes
overnight.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
constitution
requires
ambassadors
to
be
appointed
with
the
consent
of
the
senate.
it
gives
congress
the
power
of
the
purse.
so
why
don't
--
why
isn't
the
better
view
that
we
let
congress
express
its
approval
and
disapproval
in
the
mechanism
set
up
by
the
constitution
to
do
so?
meaning,
if
the
president
recognizes
a
country
that
congress
doesn't
want
it
to
recognize,
it
can
withhold
approval
of
an
ambassador,
it
could
refuse
to
fund
the
embassy.
it
could
do
many
other
things.
but
what
entitles
congress
to
trench
on
a
presidential
power
that
has
been
exercised
virtually
since
the
beginning
of
the
country?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
what
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--general,
the
--
the
tension
that
i
see
here,
and
i
think
it's
what
justice
breyer's
getting
at,
is
the
label's
important,
because
if
we
call
this
a
political
question
and
don't
address
the
merits,
the
outcome
is
that
the
president
is
saying
that
he's
entitled
to
ignore
the
congress.
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
message
that
sends,
but
it's
a
little
unsettling
that
a
court
charged
with
enforcing
the
laws
passed
by
congress
are
basically
saying
we
are
not
going
to
determine
whether
this
law
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
that's
what
your
definition
of
political
question
is
becoming,
and
where
does
that
stop?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
what
situations?
only
in
foreign
policy
do
we
decide
not
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
not
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
--
let's
assume
that
a
dozen
nations
said
this
designation
on
the
passport
as
we
view
is
an
act
of
war.
if
the
united
states
is
going
to
do
this,
we're
going
to
view
it
as
an
act
of
war.
would
that
then
permit
the
president
to
ignore
congress's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
it's
not
the
misperception
that's
at
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
misperception
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
which
is
what
you're
saying
is
congress
dictates
foreign
policy
in
the
end.
