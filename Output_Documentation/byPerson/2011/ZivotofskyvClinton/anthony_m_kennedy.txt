anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
--
under
your
theory,
and
this
is
just
a
following
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
think.
under
your
theory
what
foreign
relations
determinations
are
for
the
president
alone
to
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
foreign
relations
determinations
that
are
for
the
president
alone
to
make
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
those
are?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
who
gets
the
telegram?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
treatise
writer
or
decision
of
this
court
that
supports
such
a
narrow,
crabbed
interpretation
of
the
president's
foreign
affairs
power?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course--
mr.
lewin
--
congress
does
not
authorize--
--the
jackson
tripartite
division,
this
famous
division
he
had,
i
think
assumes
the
validity
of
the
congressional
statute
at
the
first
step
of
inquiry.
and
here
that's
the
whole
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
wasn't
a
case
--
that
wasn't
a
case
in
which
the
congress
had
said
you
may
not
seize
mills.
and
that's
what
your
case
is.
so
there's
a
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
if
you
assume
that
the
statute
is
valid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
statute
is
invalid
we
are
in
category
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
different
than
the
rationale
of
the
d.c.
circuit.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
defending
the
rationale
of
the
d.c.
circuit--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
there's
no
jurisdiction.
and
--
you
know,
it's
always
awkward
for
us
to
tell
counsel
what's
in
their
best
interest,
but
--
but
it
does,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
your
position
would
be
much
stronger
if
you
said
there
is
jurisdiction
and
the
president
wins.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
this
--
if
this
rationale
remains
the
law
and
is
the
law,
then
you
have
the
specter
of
constant
legislative
determinations
that
are
not
clearly
--
not
clearly
invalid.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's,
again
with
all
due
respect,
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
ultimate
argument
you
are
making.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
hear
the
third.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
just
--
just
one
question
on
--
on
washington's
recognition
of
revolutionary
france.
you
cite
in
the
reply
brief
the
fact
that
the
administration
was
simply
following
what
it
deemed
to
be
a
dictate
of
international
law.
do
you
want
us
to
infer
from
that
that
he
was
not
exercising
real
discretion
there?
