justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
have
been
the
reasons
that
--
because
your
friend
says
that
this
is
an
a
fortiori
case
from
everything,
because
all
of
these
words
--
every
time
the
word
"exclusive
power"
has
appeared
in
any
source
--
i
think
that's
what
you
are
saying
--
it
is
meant
that
the
president
can
act
without
supporting
authority
from
congress.
but
there
never
has
been
a
case
or
a
suggestion
that
the
president
can
act
where
congress
has
legislated
to
the
contrary.
now,
i
think
that's
the
--
that's
the
argument.
and
so
what
--
i
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right
now,
but
my
question
is
what
leads
you
to
that
conclusion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
very,
very
few
cases
i
can
ever
think
of
where
--
where
the
president
--
where
the
court
has
said
the
president
can
act
contrary
to
a
statute.
and
so
the
point
of
my
question
was
to
get
you
to
talk
about
why,
even
though
this
is
a
fortiori.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
--
i
don't
want
the
time
to
elapse.
you
can
finish
that
if
you'd
like.
i'd
just
like
somewhere
a
few
words
about
the
political
question,
which
you
don't
believe
in
--
from
reading
your
brief.
i
would
say
you
don't
believe
in
it
much.
and
my
question
on
the
political
question
for
either
of
you
is
this:
that
--
that
this
is
an
area
of
foreign
affairs.
it's
an
area
of
--
of,
you
know,
recognition.
we
know
that.
never
has
this
court
or
anyone
else
held
that
congress
can
go
ahead
in
this
area
over
a
law
passed
by
congress.
but
it
is
passports,
which
both
regulate.
and
our
real
problem
is
these
are
words
that
are
officially
said
and
they
are
detailed
words,
and
those
words
may
really
disrupt
coherent
foreign
policy.
viewed
that
way,
there
are
billions
of
words
that
might
have
the
same
effect.
and
do
we
know
that
these
words
no,
judges
don't
know
will
and
some
other
words
won't?
that.
and
therefore,
when
you
get
into
this
area,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
avoid
multifarious
pronouncements
by
various
departments
of
government
on
one
question,
do
not
respect
the
views
of
other
branches,
and
judges,
stay
out
of
it.
let
them
work
it
out
by
themselves.
i
just
want
a
word
from
either
you
and
really
mr.
lewin
on
--
on
that.
