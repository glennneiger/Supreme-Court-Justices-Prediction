justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable,
some
kind
of
justification.
can
you
work
with
the
word
"equitable"?
i
mean,
this
was
an
equitable
action,
and
could
you
say
that
the
--
to
the
district
court,
well,
of
course,
you
--
assume
you
win
on
the
second
question.
but
on
the
first
question,
this
is
not
an
on/off
thing.
that's
your
real
objection
to
the
de
novo
standard.
you
say,
but
these
are
equitable
actions,
and
generally
an
individual
should
not
be
allowed
to
run
around
the
pto.
so
you
better
have
some
kind
of
reason,
but
leave
it
up
to
the
district
courts
to
work
with
that
word
"equitable"
and
to
--
it
seems
to
me
there
will
be
a
lot
of
shading
cases
here
where
you
can't
quite
tell
if
it
is
new
or
isn't
new
and
some
parts
are
and
some
aren't.
so
just
leave
it
up
to
the
district
court
and
say:
take
into
account
the
fact
that
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
run
around
the
pto
and
work
equity.
that's
kicking
of
the
ball
back.
now
if
you
like
that,
let
me
know.
if
you
don't
like
it,
tell
me
what
we
--
why
--
what
should
we
--
you
want
an
absolute
rule,
tell
me
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
it
says
there
isn't,
then
it
can't
hear
it?
i
mean,
imagine
you're
sitting
there
as
a
district
judge,
you
think:
oh,
my
god,
they
should
have
presented
it,
but
this
is
the
key
matter
forever.
do
i
really
pay
no
attention
to
it
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
except
you
have
a
history
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
the
history
of
the
pre-apa
section
145
where
they
apparently
did
take
the
evidence
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
--
in
terms
of
here
is
a
question
on
the
standard
of
review.
i
am
somewhat
--
i
would
like
your
response
to
the
approach.
that
where
there's
ambiguity,
i
mean
you
are
going
to
win
if
there
is
no
ambiguity.
but
if
there
is
ambiguity,
i
think
that
1946
makes
a
difference.
that
is
preceding
that
time,
every
agency
went
its
own
way,
and
you
had
dozens
of
specialized
methods
of
review.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
50
years
of
administrative
law
has
been
to
try
to
create
uniformity
across
agencies
in
a
vast
federal
government.
and
now
what
is
obviously
worrying
me
in
the
first
case
and
this
case,
too,
is
we
are
chipping
away
at
that.
and
that
will
be
very
hard
for
lawyers
and
for
ordinary
people
to
understand
if
we
suddenly
go
back
and
create
specialized
rules
in
favor
of
each
agency
that
always
wants
a
specialized
rule,
of
course,
they
think
what
they
do
is
terribly
important,
which
it
is,
i'm
sure.
but
that's
why
i
am
saying
if
ambiguity
on
the
standard
of
review,
you
go
with
uniformity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
begs
the
question
in
a
sense
because
they
are
interlinked.
i
mean
the
same
reasons
would
support
that
it's
not
a
trial
de
novo
even
if
you
introduce
some
new
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
an
old
trial
with
some
new
evidence,
and
there
will
be
a
thousand
different
variations
on
that
theme.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
the
new
part
--
i
get
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
are
willing
to
accept
that,
then
what
about
broadening
that
to
prevent
people
from
running
around
the
pto,
and
simply
saying
that
unless
the
--
unless
the
person,
the
potential
patentee,
unless
he
wants
to
--
unless
he
has
shown
or
you
can
show
that
he
is
innocent,
that
is
to
say
it
wasn't
deliberate,
it
wasn't
negligent,
it
wasn't
a
part
of
a
trial
of
a
strategy,
unless
he
shows
that
he
was
totally
without
sin
in
some
form
of
words
in
not
introducing
the
evidence
the
first,
time
he
can't
introduce
it
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
say
that.
say
unless
he
can
show
that
there
was
good
cause
for
his
not
having
introduced
it
before
the
pto,
the
court
now
won't
consider
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
were
a
lawyer,
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
as
you
are;
and
you
have
the
client
there;
and
you
are
thinking,
you
know,
if
he
prints
all
his
evidence
before
the
pto,
and
they
say
no,
we
have
had
it.
i
mean,
there
we
are.
but
if
we
hold
back
something,
well
then
we
are
going
to
get
not
--
we
are
going
to
get
de
novo
review
and
a
district
court.
boy
!
but
if
we
are
too
obvious
about
holding
back
something,
we
run
into
the
estoppel
rule.
my
goodness.
you're
--
you're
in
a
mess,
it
seems
to
me,
trying
to
advise
a
client
what
to
do
in
that
situation.
better
not
say
hold
something
back;
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
does
he
is
pretty
--
how
do
you
deal?
you
see?
