chief

g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
10-1219,
kappos
v.
hyatt.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
new
evidence
is
in
reaction
to
the
pto's
ruling.
the
pto
says:
look,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
going
to
issue
a
patent
because
you
didn't
show
us
that
the
valve
in
the
back
of
the
thing
or
whatever,
was
--
was
novel,
and
we
think
that's
important.
and
the
applicant
goes
to,
under
14.5,
to
the
district
court
and
said:
well
i
didn't
submit
that
evidence
because
i
didn't
have
any
idea
that
that
was
going
to
be
a
significant
issue,
and
i
am,
you
know,
sorry,
but
i
have
a
good
basis
for
not
thinking
of
that
and
here
it
is.
is
that
the
type
of
new
evidence
that
could
be
admitted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
an
exception?
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
earlier
you
generally
can't
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
panner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
i
have
with
your
submission:
you
say
there
are
basically
two
routes
to
get
review
of
the
denial
by
the
patent
office.
the
first
is
under
141,
you
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit,
right,
and
in
that
situation,
you're
limited
to
the
record
before
the
agency--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on
which
you
lost.
and
there
is
deference
to
the
agency,
which
ruled
against
you.
under
145,
you
can
add
new
evidence,
you
could
address
questions
that
the
pto
raised,
saying
you
don't
--
you
haven't
dealt
with
this
valve
in
the
back
and
you
could
say,
well,
here's
new
evidence
dealing
with
that.
there
is
no
deference
to
the
agency.
and
to
some
extent
you
can
pick
which
judge
you
want
to
hear,
to
the
extent
you
can
--
can
do
that.
why
would
anybody
proceed
under
section
141
instead
of
145?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
in
--
in
every
case
where
it's
anything
other
than
a
purely
legal
issue,
you
would
go
under
145?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
that's
why
i
am
--
i'm
really
confused,
because
i
take
it
that
people
don't
often
use
145,
right?
they
almost
always
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
ms.
--
ms.
anders
told
us
that
there's
a
procedure
before
the
pto
that
lets
you
deal
with
these
--
these
sort
of
something
came
up
that
you
didn't
think
about,
and
you
can
address
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
as
a
practical
matter,
these
things
all
end
up
before
the
federal
circuit
anyway,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
if
you
had
the
same
case
and
one
is
coming
up
under
the
141,
and
the
other
one
under
145,
i
suppose
it
is
theoretically
possible
they
could
reach
different
results
because
of
different
standards
of
review?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know.
i'm
not
saying
--
the
point
is
that
although
they
all
come
before
the
federal
circuit,
they
may
come
to
them
at
a
very
different
posture
that
would
cause
the
federal
circuit
to
rule
differently
if
you
had
the
same
case
under
one
and
under
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
panner.
ms.
anders,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
10-1219,
kappos
versus
hyatt.
