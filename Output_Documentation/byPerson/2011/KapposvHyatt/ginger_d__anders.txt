ms.
ginger
d.
anders
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
145
of
the
patent
act
permits
a
person
who
has
sought
a
patent
from
the
pto
and
believes
that
the
agency
has
wrongly
denied
his
application
to
seek
judicial
review
of
that
decision
in
district
court.
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
the
plaintiff
in
a
section
145
action
may
obtain
a
more
favorable
standard
of
review,
de
novo
review,
by
flouting
the
pto's
rules
during
the
examination
process.
under
the
court's
approach
a
plaintiff
may
present
to
the
court
material
new
evidence
that
he
refused
or
failed
without
cause
to
present
to
the
pto.
and
as
his
reward,
he
is
given
de
novo
review
of
the
pto's
expert
determinations
on
all
of
the
relevant
issues.
for
three
reasons
that
unprecedented
regime
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand.
first,
principles
of
administrative
deference
and
exhaustion
require
that
the
pto
be
given
the
opportunity
to
apply
its
expert
judgment
to
all
of
the
reasonably
available
evidence.
for
that
reason,
section
145
should
be
interpreted
as
a
safety
valve
proceeding
that
permits
applicants
to
introduce
evidence
to
the
court
that
they
reasonably
could
not
have
presented
to
the
pto.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
no.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
yes,
section
145--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--permits
any
applicant
dissatisfied
with
the
decision
of
the
pto--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--no,
the
federal
circuit
has
held
that
in
those
cases
substantial
evidence
review
applies,
and
where
the
federal
circuit
gets
that
is
this
court's
case
in
morgan
v.
daniels.
that
was
an
action
under
section
145's
predecessor.
there
was
no
new
evidence
in
that
case
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
proceeding
in
the
nature
of
a
suit
to
set
aside
a
judgment,
the
judgment
of
the
expert
agency
which
had
made
a
determination,
and
that
therefore,
because
this
was
administrative
review,
a
deferential
standard
of
review
should
apply.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
so
it's
quite
clear
that
when--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--all
of
the
material
language
is
the
same.
there
is
--
there
is
no
material
difference
for
purposes
of
this
case.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
an
interference
proceeding,
and
that's
because
at
the
time
section
145's
predecessor
applied
equally
to
interferences
and
to
ex
parte
patent
denials.
but
the
court's
reasonings,
its
discussion
of
--
of
the
predecessor
statute,
did
not
distinguish
based
on
the
facts
that
this
was
an
interference.
and
also
this
court--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
here
we
are
suggesting
that
in
--
in
145
actions
when
there
is
new
evidence
the
morgan
"thorough
conviction"
standard
should
apply.
that
reflects
the
fact
that
the
court
needs
to
look
at
the
new
evidence,
but
because
the
pto
has
made
an
expert
determination,
as
the
court
said
in
morgan,
that
determination
should
not
be
overturned
unless
there
is
a
high
degree
of
certainty.
and
i
would
note
that
that
is
essentially
what
this
court
did
just
last
term
in
microsoft
v.
i4i.
there
the
court
said
that
when
a
third
party
is
challenging
the
validity
of
a
granted
patent,
that
the
third
party
should
have
to
show
invalidity
based
on
a
heightened
burden
of
proof,
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
and
that
reflects
the
same
wisdom
that
--
that
underlies--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--certainly,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
that
the
district
court
did
characterize
this
as
new
evidence,
and
the
reason
it
did
that
is
because
mr.
hyatt
made
a
concerted
strategic
decision
here
to
present
his
affidavit
as
new
evidence.
in
form
this
is
--
this
is
factual
evidence.
this
is
a
declaration
containing
proffer
testimony
that
mr.
hyatt
would
offer
if
there
were
a
trial.
so
it
is
in
form
factual
evidence,
and
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
possibility
of
introducing
new
evidence
in
the
section
145
action,
mr.
hyatt
argued
that
this
is
new
factual
evidence
that
should--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--certainly.
i
think
whether
or
not
the
--
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
the
written
description
is
sufficient
is
a
question
of
law.
it
would
be
one
that
rests
on
several
subsidiary
fact
findings,
including
what
the
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
is,
what
a
person
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
would
understand
when
he
reads
the
specification,
and
where
in
the
specification
there
is
support,
there
is
description
support,
for
the
claims
that
shows
that
mr.
hyatt
possessed
the
invention
that
he
claimed.
and
so
i
think
when
you
look
at
what
happened
at
the
pto,
the
examiner
said:
despite
my
expertise,
i
can't
tell
where
in
the
specification
your
claims
are
supported.
this
is
at
258
--
it's
a
250-page
specification
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
has
over
100
pages
of
diagrams
of
source
code
and
117
claims.
and
so
the
pto
asked
for
this
information;
mr.
hyatt
refused
to
present
it
or
he
didn't
present
it,
and
then
on
rehearing
the
board
said
that
he
had
not
had
any
cause
not
to
present
his
new
--
this
new
argument.
and
so
at
that
point
mr.
hyatt
went
into
the
145
proceeding
and
he
was
--
he
characterized
this
as
factual
evidence
in
order
to
get
around,
presumably,
or
it
would
be
reasonable
to
try
to
get
around,
the
board's
ruling
that
he
couldn't
present
new
evidence.
now
you
certainly
could
characterize
this
as
legal
argument.
we
believe
that
we
would
win
on
that
ground
as
well,
even
if
this
were
new
argument,
because
certainly
the
pto
is
entitled
to
enforce
its
rules
here,
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
panel
found
that
the
pto
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
--
in
holding
that
mr.
hyatt
had
forfeited
his
right
to
raise
this
argument.
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
an
additional
question
presented
that
we
--
that
we
added
here
because
it's
a
very
case-specific
question.
but
at
any
rate
the
--
the
entire
case
has
now
been
litigated
on
the
basis
of
this
being
factual
evidence--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
certainly.
i
think
it
should
be
very
clear
that
we
would
win
on
that
ground.
the
en
banc
court
here
characterized
this
as
new
factual
evidence
and
applied
a
rule
that
will
--
will
govern,
if
it's
left
to
stand,
in
all
145
actions,
would
will
permit
applicants
to
withhold
evidence
from
the
pto.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
in
the
145
proceeding
the
applicant
has
the
ability
to
introduce
new
evidence
that
couldn't
be
presented
to
the
pto.
and
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
there's
two
primary
categories,
both
of
which
can
be
very
important
in
the
examination
proceedings.
the
first
is
oral
testimony.
the
pto
doesn't
hear
oral
testimony,
but
it
is
routine
in
the
examination
procedures
for--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--he
could
certainly
bring
that
to
the
district
court,
yes.
now
the
district
court
always,
under
general
evidentiary
rules,
can
say:
i
believe
this
evidence
is
cumulative
so
i'm
not
going
to
hear
it.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
believes
it
would
be
helpful
to
hear
oral
testimony,
for
instance,
if
the
pto's
determinations
involve
credibility
decisions,
then
certainly
the
district
court
could
hear
that
testimony,
and
that's
often
how
this
proceeding
has
been
used.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
there
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
justification
for
not
having
presented--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--the
standard
we
are
proposing
is
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
determine
whether
there
was
reasonable
cause
not
to
present
the
evidence
to
the
pto.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
it's
no
different
from
exhaustion
or
forfeiture
rules
in
any
other
context.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
the
board
applicant
has
the--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
certainly
in
the
early
cases
they
took
new
evidence
in.
but
by
1952,
which
is
when
congress
re-enacted
this
provision,
you
have
the
lower
courts
applying
the
morgan
standard
and
saying:
based
on
morgan's
reasoning,
because
we
know
that
the
pto
is
the
primary
fact
finder,
because
we
know
their
decision
is
so
important,
we
will
apply
limitations
on
new
evidence
because
we
don't
think
that
that
evidence--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
the
other
primary
category
of
evidence
that
could
come
in
would
be
evidence
that
has
a
temporal
component.
if
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
can
be
relevant
to
patentability
that
develops
only
slowly
or
that
might
arise
very
late
in
the
process.
so
for
instance,
obviousness
is
a
very
common
ground
of
rejection.
but
one
thing
that
can
be
relevant
to
obviousness
is
if
the
invention,
once
disclosed,
has
commercial
success.
so
this
type
of
sales
evidence
can
develop
very
late
in--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--for
the
most
part,
the
record
closes
once
the
--
once
the
applicant
files
his
brief
on
appeal
to
the
board.
and
then
it
can
be
months
or
years
before
the
board
issues
its
decision.
now
there
are,
there
are
a
couple
of
avenues
through
which
an
applicant
could
still
introduce
new
evidence
even
when
the
board
is
considering
the
appeal.
but
both
of
those,
as
the
process
goes,
the
request
for
continuing
examination
and
the
continuation
application,
both
of
those
have
increasing
down
sides
that
require
the
applicant
to
abandon
his
appeal
or
give
up
some
of
his
patent
--
the
patent
term
that
he
would
presumably
get,
so--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
in
the
first
instance,
the
pto's
procedures
actually
provide,
they
actually
provide
for
this
situation,
and
that's
when
the
board
or
the
examiner
enters
a
new
ground
of
rejection.
then
at
that
point
the
applicant
has
the
right
to
reopen
prosecution
to
introduce
new--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--right.
yes.
i'm
sorry.
this
is
an
exception
that
would
apply
when
there
is
a
new
ground
for
the
decision.
that
is
something
that
mr.
hyatt
could
have
tried
to
take
advantage
of.
he
didn't.
he
simply
sought
rehearing.
but
in
any
event,
both
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
carefully
considered
the
board's
grounds
of
rejection
and
decided
that
this
wasn't
--
that
these
weren't
new
grounds
for
rejection,
and
the
panel
affirmed
that.
but
to
get
back
to
the
difference
between
141
and
145,
i
think
congress
separated
these
two
proceedings
out
in
1927.
before
that
you
had
gotten
an
appeal
first
on
the
record
and
then,
and
then
the
bill
in
equity
under
145.
so
congress
separated
this
in
1927,
and
it
appears
from
the
legislative
history
that
it's
concerned
with
streamlining
the
proceeding
and
having
more
efficiency
in
patent
appeals.
so
it
would
be
reasonable
to
conclude
that
there
would
be
some
number
of
applicants
who,
probably
the
majority
of
applicants,
who
wouldn't
have
new
evidence,
who
could
go
to
141
and
simply
get
a
final
decision
from
a
court
after
one
court
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--simply
that
there
are
--
for
some
number
of
other
applicants,
it
was
important
to
provide
a
safety
valve
because
the
pto
couldn't
consider
oral
testimony
and
because
certainly
at
the
time
oral
testimony
was
a
major
concern
in
interference
proceedings,
where
you
would
often
have
two
inventors
saying:
i
invented
it
first.
no,
i
invented
it
first.
and
you
would
have
this
credibility
fight.
so
it
was
very
important
at
the
time
to
provide
a
safety
valve
proceeding
for
those
applicants.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
yes,
and
morgan,
in
fact,
was
a
case
like
that.
it
appears
some
applicants
may
have
done
that.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
no,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
for
an
applicant
who
had
no
new
evidence
at
that
time.
but
i
think
the
--
the
other
alternative,
to
treat
145
as
an
entirely
de
novo
proceeding
that
allows
any
new
evidence
that
the
applicant
failed
without
cause
to
present
to
the
pto,
thereby
obtaining
de
nova
review,
it's
--
there
is
no
evident
policy
justification
for
congress
to
provide--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
you
are
correct,
justice
kennedy,
that
--
that
the
en
banc
court
believed
that
administrative
deference
principles
didn't
weigh
against
its
conclusions
because
the
district
court
could
give
more
weight
to
the
new
evidence:
but
that
is
not
an
adequate
response,
we
don't
think,
because
this
is
still
de
novo
review.
so
once
the
applicant
introduces
new
evidence,
the
manner
in
which
the
district
court
evaluates
the
pto's
conclusions
has
entirely
changed.
this
is
no
longer
a
deferential
standard
looking
at
the
evidence.
this
is
actually
de
novo
review,
with
no
deference
given
to
any
of
the
pto's
fact
findings,
even
on
the
evidence
before
it.
and
we
don't
think
that
is
a
sensible
way
to
read
the
statute
because
there
is
no
basis
in
the
text
of
the
statute
for
a
bifurcated
standard
that
would
provide
for
deferential
"thorough
conviction"
review
when
there
is
no
new
evidence,
but
then
de
novo--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
judge
newman's
position
i
think
is
inconsistent
with
morgan,
because
morgan
was
a
section
--
revised
statute
4915
action.
it
was
a
145
action
with
no
new
evidence.
and
the
court
there
said
that
the
"thorough
conviction"
standard
should
apply
because
this
is
administrative
review.
so
to
hold
that
145
requires
de
novo
review
even
when
there
is
no
new
evidence
would
be
to
overrule
morgan.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
morgan
did
not
directly
address
the
--
the
admissibility
of
new
evidence,
but
by
saying
that
the
pto
is
the
primary
decisionmaker,
and
that
the
court
should
not
lightly
set
aside
what
the
pto
does,
it
invoked
administrative
deference
principles,
which
in
turn
show
why
all
of
the
reasonably
available
evidence
needs
to
be
presented
to
the
agency.
and
--
i
do
think
that
it
--
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
have
a
de
novo
standard
of
review
for
patent
denials
any
time
new
evidence
comes
in,
largely
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
microsoft.
there,
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
a
third
party
who
had
no
opportunity
to
present
evidence
to
the
pto
should
not
be
held
to
as
high
a
standard
of
review.
so
it
would
be
particularly
perverse
here
to
say
that
de
novo
review
should
apply
whenever
a
patent
applicant
puts
in
any
new
evidence
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
that
the
presumption
of
validity
and
the
need
to
give
deference
to
the
pto's
determinations
are
essentially
two
ways
of
--
of
saying
the
same
thing.
as
microsoft
noted,
the
presumption
of
--
of
validity
comes
from
the
assumption
that
the
agency
is
presumed
to
do
its
job.
that's
what
judge
ridge
said.
and
that
in
turn
is
what
the
court
said
in
rca,
where
it
announced
the
presumption
of
validity,
and
there,
it
relied
on
morgan--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
the
record
does
support
our
argument,
justice
sotomayor,
because
what
you
see
in
the
early
twentieth
century
after
morgan
had
construed
this
as
administrative
review
--
you
referred
to
the
1927
hearing.
there,
i
think
many
of
the
people
used
the
phrase
apa.
they
referred
to
it
mostly
as
the
--
as
a
contrast
between
the
original
action
and
the
appeal.
and
that's
the
same
thing
you
see
in
the
early
cases.
for
instance,
globe-union
referred
to
this
as
a
de
novo
proceeding,
even
as
it
said
that
the
thorough
conviction
standard
should
apply
and
--
and
new
evidence
should
be
limited
because
this
was
administrative.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
place
very
much
weight
on
the
use
of
the
term
"de
novo".
i
do
think
it
is
notable
that
every
time
there
was
an
objection
in
the
cases
before
1952,
the
courts
applied
limitations
on
new
evidence.
dowling,
the
case
you
referred
to,
that
was
dicta;
the
court
discussed
the
standard
but
didn't
actually
apply
it
there.
and
so
i
think
the
most
natural
inference
is
that
in
1952,
congress
looked
to
morgan
and
it
looked
to
these
cases,
and
it
viewed
this
as
an
administrative
review
proceeding.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
thank
you.
this
is
an
action
for
judicial
review
of
agency
determination.
this
is
an
action
that
requires
the
patent
applicant
to
--
to
seek
a
property
right
from
the
agency,
to
have
it
denied,
and
to
challenge
that
in
court.
and
as
a
result,
this
court
said
in
zurko
that
this
is
review
of
an
agency
determination,
and
therefore,
morgan's
deferential
standard
should
be
carried
forward
into
the
apa.
and
in
construing
morgan,
the
court
in
zurko
did
not
consider
that
it
was
--
whether
a
property
right
had
been
awarded
or
not;
it
was
simply
that
the
agency
had
made
a
determination
in
its
expertise.
and
i
think
that
goes
to
why
it
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
court
simply
to
weigh
the
evidence
differently.
in
every
other
agency
--
judicial
review
proceeding
of
actions,
the
rule
is
that
the
agency
is
the
primary
decisionmaker.
the
agency
has
to
consider
the
evidence
first
and
make
a
determination.
that
aids
judicial
review.
it
allows
the
agency
to
apply
its
expertise.
and
we
generally
don't
think
of
the
court
as
being
the
one
who
should
make
the
first
determination
on
issues
of
fact.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
that
language
was
in
the
statute
in
morgan
when
the
court
construed
this
as
judicial
review.
and
i
think
that
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
compelling
reason
in
order
to
interpret
the
statute
to
permit
an
agent
--
the
applicant
--
to
introduce
evidence
that
he
failed
without
cause
--
without
justification
to
provide
to
the
agency.
and
i
don't
think
that
mr.
hyatt
has
shown
any
such
justification.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
certainly
there
is
an
exhaustion
requirement
within
the
statute.
the
board
has
to
have
considered
the
application,
and
therefore,
it
would
make
no
sense
to
have
the
board
consider
the
application
if
it
didn't
have
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
provided.
so
i
think
in
that
sense,
you
know,
the
standard
that
the
federal
circuit
put
in
place
and
that
mr.
hyatt
is
proposing
really
is
providing--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
the
language
could
be
taken
to
suggest
that
some
new
evidence
is
admissible,
but
i
think
then
we
look
to
the
fact
that
this
--
just
like
section
141
is
a
judicial
review
proceeding
and
there
has
to
be
compelling
reason
before
we
deviate
from
the
normal
deferential
standards
that
apply
when
a
--
when
a
court
is
reviewing
an
agency's
determination.
