what
kind
of
evidence
is
that,
ms.
anders?
justice
elena
kagan
so
in
the
145,
an
applicant
can
take
all
of
his
written
affidavits
and
say:
i
want
to
present
oral
testimony,
on
these
exact
matters,
but
live?
justice
elena
kagan
but
to
the
extent
the
substance
of
that
testimony
was
something
that
he
could
have
brought
to
the
pto,
that
testimony,
in
your
view,
would
be
out
of
bounds.
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
you
really
do
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
because
your
understanding
of
what
they
wouldn't
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
present,
i
mean,
it's
very,
very
narrow.
it's
a
bunch
of
cumulative
testimony
that
nobody
would
want
to
present
and
no
judge
would
want
to
hear.
and
other
than
that,
you
are
basically
saying
in
all
circumstances,
well,
they
could
have
done
that
in
the
pto.
so
then
you
have
justice
ginsburg's
problem.
which
is,
these
are
two
channels
that
are
exactly
the
same.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
thought
that
your
brief
suggested
that
even
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
evidence,
a
person
can
go
back
to
the
pto.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
morgan
has
very
little
to
say
about
what
types
of
evidence
ought
to
be
admitted
in
this
proceeding.
and
one
thing
we
could
do
is
to
separate
out
these
two
things
and
say,
you
know,
we
think
that
there
is
a
basis
for
one,
for
let's
say
giving
the
government
a
fairly
deferential
standard
of
review
--
call
it
clear
and
convincing,
call
it
thorough
conviction
--
but
go
the
other
way,
rule
against
you
on
the
evidentiary
point,
which
morgan
says
nothing
about?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
i
guess
the
compelling
reason
is
the
statutory
language,
and
especially
with
respect
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
question.
i
mean,
it
--
the
standard
that
you
suggest
just
can't
be
derived
from
the
statutory
language,
isn't
that
right?
