what
evidence
--
oh,
please,
continue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
judge
newman's
view,
but
the
en
banc
court
took
the
middle
position.
often
in
trial
court
evidence
problems,
the
judge
says:
well,
it
goes
to
its
weight;
not
the
admissibility.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
judge
--
the
en
banc
majority
was
saying,
that
the
fact
that
it
was
not
presented
before
or
that
it
points
in
a
different
direction
from
what
the
pto
found
goes
to
its
weight,
not
its
admissibility.
in
other
words,
they
would
give
consideration
to
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
introduced
and
asked,
and
maybe
discount
it
as
a
result,
unless
there
is
a
reason.
so
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
number
one,
am
i
reading
or
am
i
summarizing
the
en
banc
majority
correctly?
and
number
two,
why
isn't
that
a
sensible
way
to
interpret
the
statute
so,
as
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting,
you
give
some
meaning
to
145?
it
--
it
performs
a
function
that
141
does
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
we
should
choose
either
between
your
position
or
judge
newman's
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
judge
does
that,
how
does
he
articulate
the
weight
that
he
gives
to
it,
the
pto
finds?
does
he
say
i
give
deference
to
this,
i
give
substantial
deference?
this
was
all
discussed
in
page
9
of
your
brief,
you
summarized
what
the
majority
opinion
of
the
en
banc
court
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
that
connection,
on
this
same
line,
do
you
agree
with
that
summary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
line
with
justice
breyer's
question,
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
some
other
agency
review
proceeding
that
is
somewhat
like
this,
or
is
this
just
unique?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
noticed
that.
