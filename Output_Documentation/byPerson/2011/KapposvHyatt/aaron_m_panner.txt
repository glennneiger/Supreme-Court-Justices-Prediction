mr.
aaron
m.
panner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
language
of
section
145,
the
structure
of
the
judicial
review
provisions
in
the
patent
act,
the
long
history
of
the
provision,
and
this
court's
constructions
of
its
predecessors
all
make
clear
that
the
government's
argument
that
a
plaintiff
is
barred
from
introducing
new
evidence
in
an
action
under
section
145,
except
in
the
unusual
if
not
extraordinary
circumstance
where
the
applicant
had
no
opportunity
to
introduce
the
substance
of
that
evidence,
is
incorrect.
section
145
does
not
follow
the
modern
norm
of
on-the-record
review.
such
review
is
afforded
under
sections
141
to
144.
and
no
principle
of
administrative
law
supports
the
government's
"no
opportunity"
standard
in
situations
where
congress
has
authorized
the
trial
de
novo
to
obtain
relief
from
adverse
agency
action.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
to
be
clear
about
what
is
permitted
under
section
145,
it
is
correct
that
new
evidence
can
be
permitted
to
go
to
issues
that
have
been
properly
ruled
on
by
the
pto
in
the
course
of
ruling
on
the
ex
parte
application.
the
reason
that
appeals
to
the
federal
circuit
are
quite
common
is
because
often,
the
issue
that
is
the
basis
for
the
rejection
is
a
legal
issue.
and
as
to
those
issues,
there's
de
novo
review
in
the
federal
circuit.
the
federal
circuit
will
be
ruling
on
those
legal
issues
in
time
in
any
event.
it
is
really
in
the
circumstance
where
there
is
a
factual
question
as
to
which
new
evidence
is
relevant,
where
the
applicant
will
avail
himself
of
what--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
had
evidence
that
you
wanted
to
present,
and
the
remedies
at
the
pto
were
inadequate
for
one
reason
or
another.
but
in
thinking
about
the
practical
implications
of
the
procedural
option
that
section
145
affords,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
procedure
has
been
in
place
for
generations,
and
it
has
been
understood
by
the
patent
bar
as
reflected
in
decisions
of--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
i
think
that
the
number
of
cases
involving
rejections
that
are
taken
up
into
court
are
somewhat
limited,
in
part
because
applicants
often
have
an
adequate
remedy
before
the
pto.
but
where
there
is
a
circumstance,
where
there
has
been
a
final
--
a
board
action,
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
--
the
--
i
--
the
ground
for
rejection,
not
meaning
the
technical
grounds,
because
the
grounds
of
written
description
had
been
identified
in
the
examiner's
decision
--
but
where
the
reasoning
that
justified
the
rejection
was
quite
new
in
the
decision
of
the
board,
and
where
there
were
--
there
was
factual
evidence
that
the
applicant
wanted
to
submit
to
a
general
district
court,
to
permit
the
district
court
to
understand
where
in
the
specification
the
support
for
these--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--your
honor,
what
--
what
ms.
anders
was
referring
to,
i
believe,
is
the
possibility
to
reopen
where
there
are
new
grounds
for
a
rejection.
there
were
no
new
grounds
here
because
it
was
still
a
written
description
rejection.
the
applicant
did
argue
in
appeal,
in
filing
for
rehearing,
that
the
explanation
that
the
board
had
provided
was
one
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
discern
from
the
examination
--
of
the
examiner's
rejection.
and
if
you
just
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
when
the
examiner
said
that
there
was
support
lacking
for
the
features
that
were
--
where
the
board
eventually
did
affirm,
there
is
no
explanation
as
to
what
element
was
missing.
why
the
feature
was
not
supported
in
the
specification.
the
board
provided
that
reasoned
explanation,
and
the
applicant
tried
to
respond
and
the
board
refused
to
accept
it.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
right.
well,
there
is
really
two
points,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
standard
of
review,
which
is
separate
from
the
question
of
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
on
standard
of
review
the
apa
says
that
where
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
this
standard
is
whether
the
finding
is
unwarranted
by
the
facts
under
2(f).
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i
think
that
goes
to
justice
sotomayor's
point
really,
which
is
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
and
clearly
at
a
minimum
what
the
courts
are
talking
about
when
they
refer
to
this,
not
five
times,
not
ten
times
but
dozens
of
times
this
court
several
times,
lower
courts
pervasively
when
they
are
talking
about
a
de
novo
proceeding
they
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
applicant
can
introduce
new
evidence
to
attempt
to
overcome
the
adverse
action
that
was
entered
by
the--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--okay.
and
then
the
question
becomes
what
is
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
when
there
is
new
evidence
going
to
this
question.
and
the
answer
here
goes
i
think
to
section
2(f)
says
that
there
is
--
the
question
is
whether
it's
warranted
by
the
facts.
there
is
then
the
question
of
what
weight
may
be
afforded
to
a
particular
agency
--
agency
determination.
at
a
minimum,
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
rejection
shifts
the
burden.
when
an
applicant
goes
to
the
pto,
there
is
an
assumption
of
an
entitlement
to
patent,
unless
the
pto
can
show
that
the
applicant
is
not
entitled
to
that
patent.
so
the
burden
is
on
the
pto.
once
there
has
been
a
proper
rejection
by
the
agency
and
the
board
has
ruled,
then
of
the
applicant
bears
the
burden.
so
at
a
minimum
there
has
been
a
shifting.
and
the
applicant
would
then
bear
the
burden
and
as
a
practical
matter,
as
the
federal
circuit
indicated,
the
district
judge
will
weigh
the
evidence
before
it,
including
the
new
evidence
and
the
findings
by
the
agency
in
making
its
determination
as
to
whether
the
applicant
has
carried
his
burden
to
show
that
he's
entitled
to
the
patent.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
do,
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
that
what
the
federal
circuit
recognized
is
that
in
determining
the
weight
to
give
to
new
evidence
and
in
determining
what
weight
to
give
to
the
determined
--
prior
determination
of
the
agency,
it's
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
new
evidence
and
1
of
the
things,
this
is
inequitable
--
was
an
equitable
action.
and
of
course
the
judge
is
sitting
without
a
jury.
in
microsoft
there
was
obviously
concern
by
this
court
that
there
not
be
shifting
standards
of
proof
that
would
be
confusing
to
a
jury
and
could
lead
to
collateral
litigation
about
that.
where
a
district
judge
is
making
a
determination
about
a
factual
issue,
the
district
judge
can
as
a
practical
matter
quite
reasonably
determine
what
was
before
the
board,
what
did
the
board
decide,
what
was
the
basis
for
that,
how
strongly
supported
is
it,
versus
how
--
how
--
to
what
extent
is
this
new
evidence,
something
that
really
requires
me
to
look
at
this
anew.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
unique
at
all,
your
honor.
that
is
to
say,
for
example,
in
proceedings
where
there
is
orders
to
pay
money
by
the
fcc,
the
findings
of
the
agency
are
given
prima
facie
weight
in
an
action
--
in
an
enforcement
action.
and
so
new
evidence
is
permitted
and
the
district
judge
would
make
a
determination
based
on
the
record
and
the
new
evidence.
but
the
party
or
the
agency
seeking
to
enforce
the
prior
order
would
be
able
to
rely
on
those
factual
findings
to
--
as
prima
facie
evidence,
where
if
there
was
no
contrary
evidence
that
would
actually
establish
those
facts.
there
are
other
administrative
review
schemes
that
do
afford
trial
de
novo
in
which
there
may
be
more
or
less
deference
to
whatever
the
agency
did
depending
on
what
the
record
may
reflect
about
the
considered
judgment
of
the
agency.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
principle
of
estoppel
that
was
recognized
in
barrett
is
not
one
that
we
are
challenging.
that
is
to
say
in
a
circumstance
in
which
an
applicant,
and
of
course
that
was
an
interference
proceeding
and
it's
perhaps
easier
to
foresee
this
happening
in
an
interference
context,
but
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
had
actually
suppressed,
had
directed
witnesses
not
to
answer
questions
that
went
into
a
particular
factual
area.
and
then
when
--
after
appeal
and
when
the
district
court
action
was
brought,
attempted
to
introduce
the
very
evidence
that
he
had
--
that
the
applicant
had
deliberately
suppressed.
and
the
district
court
said,
look,
that
is
--
gives
rise
to
an
estoppel,
which
seems
to
me
a
generally
applicable
principle.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that,
your
honor,
is
not
only
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
practice
of
the
courts
which
have
always
recognized
that
but
it
also
ignores
the
fact
that
there
needs
to
be
decisions
that
an
applicant
makes
about
what
evidence
to
present
to
the
pto.
and
there
may
be
good
cause
for
not
presenting
evidence
in
the
pto
that
becomes
quite
relevant
once--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--well,
your
honor
we
would
certainly
meet
that
good
cause
standard
in
this
case
but
the
thing
that
i
think
is
difficult
about
that
standard
is
that
it
could
potentially
lead
to
all
sorts
of
collateral
litigation.
in
a
typical
case,
for
example,
an
applicant
will
seek
to
introduce
new
expert
testimony
that
either
was
not
or
was
--
is
additional
to
whatever
was
at
issue
or
was
offered
in
the
pto.
often
expert
testimony
will
not
be
offered
at
all
in
an
ex
parte
application.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
justice
sotomayor,
to
be
clear,
the
proper
standard
is
one
--
does
not
permit
exclusion
of
evidence
because
there
was
good
cause
to
present
it
and
it
was
not.
the
standard
for
--
which
we
think
is
supported
in
the
cases
is
one
that
would
permit
the
introduction
of
evidence
as
the
federal
circuit
said
consistent
with
the
rules
of
evidence
in
civil
procedure.
that's
why
principles
of
estoppel
which
are
reflected
in
ordinary
equity
practice,
not
just
administrative
review
context,
would
be
--
would
be
applicable
and
could
lead
to
the--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--and
i
that
think
in
looking
at
the
cases
that
were
decided
before
1952,
which
everyone
seems
to
--
to
agree
is
--
is
the
magic
date,
the
furthest
that
any
court
went
was
the
decision
in
barrett.
and
it's
interesting
that
the
panel
decision
in
this
case
also
relied
on
the
idea
in
barrett.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
not--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--in
the
court
of
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
the
only
exclusion
of
evidence--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--was
from
barrett
and
that
was
a
case
that
involved
again,
directing
a
witness
not
to
answer,
the
suppression
of
inquiry
into
a
particular
factual
area
where
the
applicant
then
--
changing
his
story
and
claiming
a
different
date
for
reduction
of
practice
and
a
different
basis
for
reduction
to
practice
than
had
been
argued
before
the
pto
--
attempted
to
introduce
the
evidence
that
he
had
suppressed.
so
that's
a
very
different
circumstance.
and
the
courts
--
the
decisions
are
actually
at
pains
to
say
that
barrett
should
not
be
over-read.
the
third
circuit
in
the
carborundum
case
said
that;
the
nichols
case,
which
we've
we
cited
in
our
brief
said
that;
and
of
course,
as
you
pointed
out,
judge
hand
observed
that
in
the
--
in
the
dowling
case.
globe-union
said
that,
so
even
the
cases
that
the
government
itself
relied
on
were
accepted
evidence,
despite
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
the
defendants
in
those
cases
that
this
was
evidence
that
should
have
been
excluded
because
it
could
have
been
presented.
and
--
and
did
consider
it.
and
that
brings
us,
i
think
--
there
has
been
a
--
a
lot
of
discussion
about
morgan
and
the
standard
of
review
and
what
morgan
has
to
say
about
that.
and
the
critical
point
that
this
court
recognized
in
microsoft
was
that
morgan
is
one
of
the
early
cases
and
then
--
and
radio
corporation
is
another
that
depend
on
an
idea
of
the
presumption
of
validity,
which
of
course
was
then
adopted
by
congress
in
section
282
as
a
statutory
presumption,
that
was
given
that
common
law
meaning
that
required
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
but
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
to
overcome
the
grant
of
a
property
right
to
the
defendant
in
those
cases.
what
is
critical
in
morgan
is
the
fact
that
the
patent
office
had
granted
a
patent
to
the
defendant
and
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
that
patent
that
the
plaintiff's
case
relied
on.
and
it's
--
and
that's
absolutely
clear
because
the
court
cites
to
johnson
v.
towsley
which
is
a
case
involving
a
land
grant.
and
what
the
court
says
is,
our
presumption
is
when
the
executive
has
the
power
to
give
property
rights,
we
don't
get
a
to
review
it.
now
in
this
case
we
see
a
limited
exception,
because
there
is
a
statute
that
actually
tells
us
we
have
to
do
it,
but
that
exception
is
going
to
be
limited.
but
if
you
look
at
what
morgan
relies
on,
morgan
is
not
relying
on
agency
expertise;
it's
relying
on
agency
authority,
which
is
a
different
matter.
and
so
--
and
the
authority
the
agency
had
to
grant
a
property
right.
in
the
--
in
the
conception
of
a
--
of
the
court
of
1893,
and
the
administrative
law
that
existed
in
1893,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
property
right
being
challenged
in
an
action
where
there
was
an
effort
to
overcome
a
rejection
means
that
this
idea
about
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
the
rights
that
had
been
granted
by
an
executive
department
doesn't
come
into
play.
there
had
been
no
rights
granted
by
the
executive
department,
and
there
is
a
new
proceeding
in
which,
to
quote
professor
merrill's
article,
"the
court
had
the
whole
case.
"
and
that
is
really
reflected
in
the
language
that
congress
chose.
now,
of
course,
that
--
the
differences
between
what
congress
provided
under
section
145
and
the
modern
administrative
review
do
lead
to
some
--
to
some
questions.
there
is
the
question,
you
know,
what
should
the
standard
be
if
there
is
no
new
evidence?
which
--
you
know,
which
the--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--your
honor,
judge
newman
said
that
if
there
--
that
all
--
all
findings
should
be
de
novo
in
a
section
145
action,
but
the
--
the
majority
of
the
en
banc
court
said
if
there
is
no
new
evidence
--
relying
on
what
the
federal
circuit
had
held
for
many
years,
that
if
there
is
no
new
evidence
than
the
standard
would
be
the
substantial
evidence
standard
that
would
apply
on
appeal.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
it,
but--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--let
me
suggest
why
it
might
be
right,
your
honor.
which
is
that
section
141
and
section
144
do
--
this
court
in
--
you
know,
held
in
zurko
that
once
you
are
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
new
evidence
--
and
as
an
aside,
zurko
emphasized
that
morgan
was
a
case
that
was
on
no
new
evidence
--
where
you
have
in
a
case
that's
on
no
new
evidence,
there
the
apa
standard
of
--
of
review,
substantial
evidence,
arbitrary
and
capricious,
review
applied.
and
it
might
--
this
might
be
the
sort
of
narrow
circumstance
where
to
apply
a
de
novo
standard,
even
though
that
may
be
otherwise
suggested
by
the
language
of
section
145,
would
create
an
anomaly,
as
--
as
this
court
recognized
in
zurko.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
right.
i
--
i
don't
think--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i'm
not
sure--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--and,
your
honor,
i
think
the
standard
of
proof
is
one
of
--
is
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
the
question
of
what
weight,
as
the
federal
circuit
said,
what
weight
to
afford
to
that
prior
finding
of
the
pto,
would
depend
on
what
the
record
showed.
that
is
the
--
as
the
facts
of
the
case
may
appear
in
section
145.
it
requires
the
district
court
to
look
at
the
findings
and
look
at
the
new
evidence,
and
to
then
make
a
determination.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
as
section
--
as
i
say,
the
language
of
morgan
deals
with
the
circumstance
in
which
there
is
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
an
issued
patent.
the
action
that
was
at
issue,
the
action
as
to
which
the
validity
was
being
challenged,
was
not
the
denial
of
the
patent
to
the
applicant;
it
was
the
fact
that
the
pto
had
issued
a
patent
to
the
defendant
in
that
case.
and
so
there
was
a
collateral
attack,
effectively
a
collateral
challenge
to
the
validity
of
that
issued
patent.
and
that
is
why
radio
corporation
of
america
cites
morgan,
and
that's
how
you
know,
it's
relevant
to
the
--
this
court's,
you
know,
decision
in
microsoft,
that
the
statutory
presumption
of
validity
carries
this
heightened
standard
of
proof.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
i
think
the
--
i
understand
the
concern,
but
the
practicalities
of
patent
prosecution
practice
are
that
no
applicant
would
hold
back
evidence
in
an
effort
to
--
to
--
to
produce
that
sort
of
tactical
advantage,
because
once--
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
--i
think
because
it's
--
it's
frankly
more
straightforward
and
easier
to
try
to
meet
those
objections
in
the
office.
that's
what
usually
happens,
is
that
there's
a
dialogue
with
the
examiner
to
try
to
meet
the
grounds
for
rejection.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
important
with
respect
to
the
context
of
this
case
is,
there
were
a
vast
number
of
rejections.
there
was
not
just
a
rejection
on
written-description
enablement
grounds,
but
there
were
rejections
for
double
patentings;
there
were
rejections
for
anticipation;
there
were
rejections
for
obviousness.
and
every
single
one
--
every
single
one
--
of
those
grounds
for
rejection
was
overcome
in
the
appeal
before
the
board.
and
many
of
the
written-description
rejections
were
overcome
in
the
appeal
before
the
board.
and
--
and
at
--
with
respect
to
every
one
--
if
one
goes
back
and
reads
the
examiner's
decision,
the
examiner
did
provide
an
explanation
as
to
what
was
lacking
with
respect
to
certain
elements
of
the
claimed
invention,
and
with
respect
to
every
single
one
of
those,
the
board
reversed.
so
where
the
applicant
was
provided
a
fair
opportunity
to
try
to
meet
the
concerns,
the
applicant
did
so,
and
the
board
ruled
in
his
favor.
and
he
again
attempted
--
there
is
no
question
of
sandbagging
here.
the
--
the
applicant
brought
these
arguments
to
the
board
in
the
rehearing
petition
--
in
the
request
for
rehearing
--
and
said,
"here's
my
answer
to
your
more
focused
explanation.
"
and
they
--
they
refused
to
hear
it.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that
--
and
you
don't
have
to
take
my
word
for
it,
again,
because
this
procedure
has
been
in
place
for
so
long,
and
problems
have
not
arisen.
and
even
if
there
were
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
precise
standard
for
admissibility
was,
the
applicants
would
have
every
reason
to
test
that,
and
to
--
to
try
to
do
something
along
that
line
if
that
were
a
realistic
option
and
favorable.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
has
not
happened,
because
the
applicants
have
every
reason
in
the
world
to
pursue
the
application
with
vigor
before
the
office.
and
the
federal
circuit,
which
of
course
is
more
familiar
with
the
patent
application
process
than
any
other
court,
had
no
concerns
that
the
rule
that
they
were
adopting
would
lead
to
abuses.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
you
can't
do
both.
mr.
aaron
m.
panner
well,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
be
on
the
same
record.
if
it
were
on
the
same
record,
then
presumably
the
--
the
issue
that
would
be
presented
would
be
quite
similar.
the
only
time
i
can
see
that
--
so
in
other
words,
if
there
were
a
different
record,
it's
true
that
the
federal
circuit's
review
of
the
district
decision
would
be
--
it
would
be
the
difference
that
this
court
recognized
in
zurko.
it
would
be
the
court
--
court
standard
of
review,
which
is
--
gives
perhaps
slightly
less
weight
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
than
the
court
agency
review.
but
that
doesn't
seem
like
an
advantage.
in
the
--
in
a
circumstance
at
least
where
an
applicant
has
prevailed,
the
applicant
would
be
more
likely
to
see
the
victory
taken
away
by
the
federal
circuit.
unless
the
court
has
questions?
thank
you,
your
honor.
