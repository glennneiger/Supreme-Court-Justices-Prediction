justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
morgan
case
involved
--
it
wasn't
a
contest
between
the
pto
and
the
would-be
patent
holder;
it
was
an
interference
proceeding,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
anders,
one
of
the
problems
with,
i
think,
your
position,
is
it
sounds
very
strange
to
have
two
proceedings,
one
where
you
go
directly
to
the
federal
circuit
under
101
--
141;
and
then
this
other
one
where
you
go
to
the
district
court,
where
if
that's
not
as
that,
as
judge
newman
said,
a
whole
new
--
whole
new
game,
then
--
and
why
would
congress
create
two
judicial
review
routes,
one
in
district
court,
reviewable
in
the
federal
circuit,
the
other
directly
in
the
federal
circuit,
if
there's
no
difference,
that
is,
if
in
both
of
them
it
is
not
de
novo
review,
it
is
review
of
what
the
agency
did
under
the
ordinary
standard
for
reviewing
agency
action?
what's
different
about
the
--
the
145
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
were
beginning
to
answer
that
by
saying,
well,
you
can't
have
oral
testimony
before
the
pto.
but
what
else?
i
asked
you
what
would
be
--
what's
different
about
141
and
145
in
your
view.
and
you
said
one
thing
is
oral
testimony.
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
that
you
could
go
into
court
on
145
even
if
you
had
no
new
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
did
you
--
in
that
case,
would
there
be
any
difference
between
141
and
145
other
than
you
go
to
a
different
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
limits
on
the
new
evidence
that
can
be
produced?
are
there
any
limits
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
you
are
not
taking
the
position
that
judge
newman
did.
i
think
--
didn't
you
say
that
if
no
new
evidence
is
introduced
in
a
145
proceeding
then
the
court
engages
in
apa-style
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
and
that--
