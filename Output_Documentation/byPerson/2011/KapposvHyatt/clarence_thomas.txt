justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
--
the
united
states
court
of
appeal
for
the
federal
circuit.
gilbert
hyatt
filed
a
patent
application
covering
multiple
claims.
an
examiner
in
the
patent
and
trademark
office
(pto)
denied
all
of
hyatt's
claims
for
lack
of
an
adequate
written
description.
hyatt
appealed
pto's
board
of
patent
appeals
and
interferences,
which
approved
some
claims,
but
denied
others.
pursuant
to
section
145
of
title
35
of
the
united
states
code,
hyatt
sought
review
of
the
board's
decision
by
filing
a
civil
action
in
federal
district
court
against
the
director
of
pto.
before
the
district
court,
hyatt
offered
for
the
first
time
a
written
declaration
in
support
of
the
adequacy
of
his
patent
application.
the
district
court
declined
to
consider
that
new
evidence
because
hyatt
had
not
provided
a
sufficient
reason
for
his
failure
to
present
it
to
the
pto.
without
the
declaration,
the
only
evidence
remaining
before
the
district
court
was
the
pto's
administrative
record.
following
federal
circuit
precedent,
the
district
court
applied
the
administrative
procedure
act's
deferential
substantive
evidence
standard
to
the
pto's
findings
and
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
director.
on
appeal,
the
federal
circuit
vacated
the
judgment
holding
that
patent
applicants
can
introduce
new
evidence
in
section
145
proceedings
subject
only
to
the
limitations
in
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
also
reaffirmed
its
precedent
that
when
new
conflicting
evidence
is
introduced
before
the
district
court,
that
court
must
make
de
novo
findings
to
make
--
to
take
such
evidence
into
account.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
the
text
of
section
145
neither
imposes
limits
on
the
presentation
of
new
evidence
in
district
court
nor
establishes
a
heightened
standard
of
review
for
pto
factual
findings.
nonetheless
--
nonetheless,
the
director
of
pto
contends
that
background
principles
of
administrative
law
restrict
the
admissibility
of
new
evidence
and
impose
a
differential
standard
of
review
in
section
145
proceedings.
we
disagree.
as
the
director
concedes,
judicial
review
in
section
145
proceedings
is
not
limited
to
administrative
record
before
the
--
to
the
administrative
record
before
the
district
court
and
--
and
the
district
court
--
because
the
district
court
may
consider
new
evidence.
if
it
does
so,
the
district
court
must
act
as
fact
finder
and
cannot
give
deference
to
pto's
--
to
the
pto's
factual
findings
when
those
findings
are
contradicted
by
new
evidence.
moreover,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
administrative
exhaustion
doctrine
is
the
avoidance
of
premature
interruption
of
the
administrative
process.
that
rationale
does
not
apply
here
because
the
pto
process
is
complete
by
the
time
a
section
145
proceeding
occurs.
our
decision
in
this
case
is
guided
by
this
court's
previous
opinion
in
butterworth
versus
the
united
states.
in
that
case,
this
court
described
the
predecessor
to
section
145
proceeding
as
an
original
civil
action
seeking
de
novo
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
a
patent
application.
although
another
of
this
court's
cases,
that
would
be
morgan
versus
daniels,
appears
to
take
a
conflicting
view,
that
case
is
distinguishable
because
it
involved
an
interference
proceeding
in
which
no
new
evidence
was
presented,
a
different
context
than
the
one
presented
here.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
only
with
a
section
145
proceeding
in
which
new
evidence
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
thus
applying
butterworth's
guidance,
we
hold
that
a
district
court
conducting
a
section
145
proceeding
may
consider
all
competent
evidence
adduced
and
is
not
limited
to
considering
only
new
evidence
that
could
not
have
been
presented
to
the
pto.
we
note,
however,
that
the
district
court
may
consider
whether
the
patent
applicant
had
an
opportunity
to
present
the
newly
proffered
evidence
to
the
pto
when
deciding
what
weight
to
afford
that
evidence.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
