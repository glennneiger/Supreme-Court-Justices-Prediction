justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
that
--
it's
interesting
that
the
language
of
morgan
and
one
of
its
companion
cases,
not
companion
in
the
sense
of
being
heard
at
the
same
time,
but
on
the
same
issue
--
the
radio
city
case
--
both
of
them
don't
talk
in
the
language
of
today.
they
don't
talk
about
deference,
they
don't
talk
about
substantial
evidence.
they
talk
about
whether
the
pto
has
expertise,
and
presumptions
that
their
fact
findings
based
on
their
expertise
have
to
be
overcome
with
some
convincing
evidence.
so
they
are
talking
in
different
language,
but
the
concept
they
are
talking
about
is
one
where
the
court
does
accept
findings
of
the
pto
on
the
matters
that
involve
their
expertise,
and
give
them
weight
--
substantial
weight,
essentially.
and
only
overturn
it
if
the
court
is,
in
the
words
of
morgan
and
radio
city,
"thoroughly
convinced"
that
they
were
wrong.
so
what's
wrong
with
that
standard?
everybody
likes
the
deference
language
of
today,
but
they
were
very
clear
in
what
they
were
saying:
if
the
pto
made
a
finding,
you
decide
whether
that
finding
was
based
on
its
expertise,
and
if
it
was,
you
don't
change
it,
court,
unless
you
are
thoroughly
convinced
they
were
wrong.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
with
that
articulation
of
what
the
standard
should
be
in
all
situations,
whether
there
is
new
evidence
or
no
new
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let
me
tell
you
what
my
problem
is
with
this
case.
it
is
the
issue
that
verizon
raised,
and
the
lack
of
connection
between
the
district
court's
holding
and
the
circuits
court
holding.
the
district
court
excluded
the
affidavit
for
the
proposed
arguments
on
the
basis
of
them
being
new
arguments
that
board
rules
precluded
them
from
raising
at
the
stage
they
did.
the
circuit
court
described
the
affidavit
as
new
evidence.
and
the
verizon
amicus
brief
says:
court,
be
careful,
because
it's
not
really
clear
what's
new
evidence
in
this
affidavit
and
what's
new
argument.
and
that
question
troubles
me,
for
the
following
reason:
verizon
posits
that
the
issue
of
whether
a
description
is
specific
enough
is
a
legal
question
to
which
the
pto
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
why,
other
than
federal
circuit
and
patent
board
precedent,
is
that
right?
and
can
you
explain
why
this
affidavit
that
was
rejected
is
in
fact
new
evidence
and
not
merely
new
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
--
other
than
it's
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit,
tell
me
what
in
the
content
was
new
evidence?
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
labels
and
i
want
to
get
to
the
substance,
because
i've
looked
at
all
of
these
submissions
and
it
sounds
like
what
i
read
in
the
briefs
every
day.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
i'm
not
sure--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
i
don't
know
that
that
--
i
think
you're
confusing
the
nature
of
the
review,
which
is
de
novo,
new,
with
the
burdens
that
attach
to
the
proof.
those
are
two
different
concepts.
and
so
that's
what
microsoft
said.
don't
confuse
burdens
with
standards
of
review.
that
it's
de
novo
review
is
one
thing,
but
even
in
de
novo
review
we
often
give
more
weight
or
presumptive
weight
to
some
facts
as
opposed
to
others.
and
that's
what
i
think
morgan
was
talking
about.
morgan
was
very
clear:
whether
it
was
new
evidence
or
not,
you
give
--
you
accept
as
valid
whatever
the
pto
does,
and
you
require
to
be
thoroughly
convinced
by
new
evidence
or
not
that
they
were
wrong.
i
don't
know
why
that
standard
can't
apply
in
any
situation.
i
think
that's
what
judge
newman
intended,
although
he
didn't
say
that.
so
why
are
we
confusing
the
standard
of
review
with
the
burden?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
two
problems
with
your
argument.
the
first
is,
and
i
know
that
it
may
be
unique
to
me
because
many
of
my
colleagues
say
that
you
don't
rely
on
legislative
history.
but
i'm
not
relying
just
on
legislative
history.
i'm
relying
that
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
the
commissioner
of
patents
himself
saying
that
section
145
required
de
novo
review.
and
witness
after
witness
tried
to
argue
for
congress
to
change
it,
and
it
didn't,
arguing
that
it
required
de
novo
review.
second,
our
cases
repeatedly
describe
it
as
de
novo
review.
so
you
got
to
get
past
that.
and
then
you
got
to
get
past
that
between
1927
and
1945
you
have
barrett
on
your
side.
but
there
are
plenty
of
courts,
including
the
second
circuit,
and
a
very
respected
jurist,
learned
hand,
saying
that
if
you
exclude
new
evidence
it
should
only
be
if
it's
on
principles
of
estoppel,
that
someone
intentionally
withheld
evidence
from
the
pto.
so
how
do
you
deal
with
a
record
that
doesn't
basic
--
that
doesn't
support
your
basic
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
give
us
a
standard
and
how
what
--
the
good
cause
that
you
are
somehow
willing
to
accept
different
from
the
government's
reasonable
cause
standard?
and
equity
seems
to
have
required
an
intentional
or
bad
faith
withholding,
is
that
what
you
want
to
limit
yourself
to?
what
do
you
do
with
sort
of
the
--
the
in
between.
the
intentional
and
the
grossly
negligent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
do
you
see
the
limits
of
that
estoppel
principal
--
equity
principal?
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
was
really
--
was
referring
to.
what
would
be
the
contours
of
your
equity
limits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
little
bit
unfair,
to
characterize
the
cases
as
limited
to
that.
some
talked
about
negligence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
some
courts
said
it
should
be
intentional.
there
was
a
debate
back
and
forth.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
i
agree.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
to
me
you
were
introducing
such
a
gamesmanship.
anybody
who
wanted
to
get
out
of
substantial
deference
under
the
apa
just
has
to
present
an
expert.
that's
--
that's
what
makes
little
sense
to
me,
trying
to
--
now
we
are
hair-splitting
in
a
very
minute
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
articulate
a
standard
that
would
--
no
one
is
suggesting
total
de
novo
review
with
no
deference
to
any
kind
of
presumption
applied
to
the
pto
decision.
another
way
to
look
at
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--is
the
way
that
i
suggested,
which
is
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
is
no
new
evidence
or
not;
what
is
the
level
of
respect
that
you
are
going
to
give
to
the
pto
factual
findings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
be
--
as
the
language
of
morgan,
be
convinced
that
the
pto
was
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why
doesn't
the
court
just
say
what
you
said.
if
it's
--
not
the
court,
congress
--
if
you
admit
that
congress
intended
a
section
145
action
to
permit
new
evidence,
if
it
wanted
to
limit
that
evidence
to
something
that
could
not
have
been
found
with
due
diligence
or
whatever
your
limitations
are,
why
did
it
speak
more
broadly?
i
mean,
the
statutory
language
suggests
as
pto.
as
law
--
"as
equity
might
permit".
this
is
very
broad
language.
