justice

(inaudible)
you
got
a
perfect
right
to
copy
it.
the
other
man
has
no
governmental
protection
of
any
kind
that
would
keep
somebody
from
copying
unless
he
has
a
patent,
trademark,
copyright,
something
granted
him
by
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
can't
be
accused
--
they
can't
accuse
you
of
deceiving
somebody
simply
because
you
copied
any
kind
of
a
commodity
that
they
--
they
make.
you
say
that's
not
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
a
state
has
a
right
to
pass
laws
making
it
an
offense
or
--
sub
--
subjecting
him
on
the
damages,
cheating
and
defrauding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
with
reference
to
your
goods
and
making
somebody
think
if
you
are
--
you
are
selling
them
goods
made
by
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
are
complete
--
but
that's
--
that's
completely
away
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
idea
of
monopoly
by
a
patent
and
copyrights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
legislature
ever
passed
a
law
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
base
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
new
feature
of
it
when
the
patent
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
pole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
know
a
lot
of
poles
in
that
section.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
a
lot
of
wirings
have
been
put
inside
the
pole.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
is
there
anything
really
new
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
was
what
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
mere
copying
then
of
a
commodity
that's
not
patented
or
is
not
copyrighted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right
but
what
i'm
asking
is
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
that's
not
what
you're
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
real
crux?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
had
done
that,
would
it
be
alright?
justice
hugo
l.
black
modification
of
--
what
would
you
have
--
would
you
still
claim
that
they
had
sold
it
with
their
own
mark
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
had
violated
the
fair
trade
law
in
illinois?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
of
the
--
the
unfair
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
they
have
a
right,
perfect
right
then
to
copy
yours
verbatim,
functional
and
nonfunctional
so
long
as
they
put
their
name
on
their
product.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
can
get
all
the
profit
sales
as
made
on
the
sale
of
those
lamps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
else
besides
just
the
profit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
attorney's
fee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
illinois
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
does
the
statute
give
him
any
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statutory
provisions
by
any
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
only
in
patent
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
damage
isn't
--
not
--
not
fixed
as
they
are
--
are
liable
by
any
statute,
it's
up
to
the
court.
