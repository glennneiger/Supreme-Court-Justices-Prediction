are
you
suggesting
that
you
can
copy
but
you
can't
sell
it
without
taking
what
precautions
you
can
to
keep

justice

and
you
--
and
--
justice
byron

white
let's
assume
that
you
make
something
that's
absolutely
identical
to
another
--
to
the
products
someone
--
someone
else
is
selling
and
it
is
confusingly
similar
in
the
sense
that
it
--
it
--
it's
not
only
identical
but
other
--
the
people
who
are
buying
it
might
think
it's
--
it
couldn't
possibly
held
as
being
yours
or
somebody
else's.
do
you
say
that
you're
not
required
to
put
your
name
on
the
--
on
--
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
--
the
item
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that
but
you're
not
--
you're
a
--
you're
manufacturing
and
selling
at
retail
pole
lamps.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
customer
comes
into
your
--
in
--
into
this
--
in
--
into
the
store
and
--
because
i
want
that
lamp.
you
don't
palm
it
off
as
anybody
else's
or
say
a
word.
and
--
but
he
does
think
it
was
made
by
--
by
stiffel.
now,
you
say
you've
got
the
right
to
do
that
even
--
and
you
don't
have
to
put
a
name
on
it,
you
don't
have
to
identify
the
source
or
origin
or
anything,
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
plenty
of
showing
that
and
he
asked
the
costumer,
"if
you
think
you're
getting
stiffel's
lamps?"
"yes,
i
thought
i
was
getting
stiffel's
lamp."
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
--
but
let's
assume
there
was.
and
the
only
thing
that
you
--
and
the
only
thing
that
--
that
happened
was
that
you
made
an
identical
lamp,
didn't
put
your
name
on
it,
and
some
costumer
bought
it,
thinking
he
was
buying
stiffel's.
now
the
--
it
--
it
was
--
the
only
reason
he
did
is
because
that
it
looks
--
it
looks
like
it.
it's
because
you
copied
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could've
have
asked
--
he
could've
have
asked,
"are
these
stiffel,
the
lamp?"
he
would've
said,
"no."
but
he
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
sears
sells
products
and
manufacturers
a
lot
of
different
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
sure
but
--
but
he
didn't
ask
anything
and
he
didn't
--
and
they
--
and
sears
didn't
tell
him
anything.
he
just
said,
"i
wanted
that
one."
but
as
a
matter
fact,
he
thought
he
was
buying
stiffel.
now
--
that
--
let's
assume

let's
assume
that
case
was
here.

question
of
validity
of
a
general
state
law
that
says,
"any
items
sold
at
retail
must
have
the
name
of
the
manufacturer
on
it"?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you,
the
very
act
of
copying
and
making
something
identical
is
--
is
an
act
which
creates
some
possibility
of
confusion
and
of
--
the
mind
of
a
buyer
who
doesn't
ask
any
questions.
and
you
don't
put
your
name
on
it,
you
could,
but
you
could
dispel
the
--
that
confusion.
i'd
suppose
that
--
that
a
general
state
law
like
that
would
have
the
act
--
would
have
the
result
of
--
of

which
you
say
can't
be
--
can't
be
placed
--
justice

white
right.
justice

well
then
why
--
why
couldn't
this
part
of
the
law
of
unfair
(inaudible)?
why
is
part
of
the
law
of
unfair
competition,
can't
illinois
say
that
it's
unfair
competition
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
somebody
puts
his
name
on
it
and
--
and
takes
the
opportunity
to
avoid
the
possible
confusion.
justice

right.

they're

objectively

weren't
they
copies,
is
that
what
you're
saying
now?
justice
byron

white
or
are
you
saying
that
nobody
got
confused?
justice

but

is

that's
really

justice

what
you
think

it's
