mr.
will
freeman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
start
with
the
issue
in
this
case
recognizing
that
this
is
a
companion
case
to
the
one
that
immediately
preceded
me.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
court,
following
state
law,
can
grant
an
injunction
which
amounts
to
the
equivalent
of
a
perpetual
common
law
monopoly
on
what
that
very
court
has
said
is
within
the
public
domain.
the
facts
are
these,
petitioner
sears,
roebuck
&
company,
and
i'll
refer
to
them
as
sears,
is
a
large
retailing
--
retail
marketing
organization
with
stores
throughout
the
united
states.
it
likewise
sells
by
mail
order
through
catalogs.
stiffel,
respondent
in
this
case,
is
a
high
grade
manufacturer
of
lamps
usually
sold
in
what
we
might
call
the
"better
department
stores",
or
through
interior
decorators.
in
1956,
stiffel
added
to
its
merchandise
line
of
table
and
floor
lamps
a
pole
lamp.
now,
the
name
"pole
lamp"
suggests
the
product.
a
lamp
which
many
of
you
may
have
seen
extending
between
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
with
two,
three
or
four
conical
shaped
lamp
fixtures
fastened
to
the
lamp.
this
is
a
called
a
"pole
lamp."
sears
watched
the
sale
of
pole
lamps
by
stiffel
in
this
case
and
i
can
say
this,
that
at
about
a
time
of
the
year
before
the
trial
of
the
case,
stiffel
had
some
25
competitors
making
pole
lamps.
sears
went
into
the
business
because
they
saw
it
was
the
type
of
business
that
the
mass
market
--
it
was
a
mass
market
product
and
that
they
could
sell
it
to
the
mass
market.
thereâ€™s
no
question
in
this
case
that
what
sears,
took
a
photograph
or
a
--
an
advertising
cut
of
the
respondent
stiffel
and
copied
it.
it
made
a
pole
lamp
that
was
certainly
similar.
sears
contracted
with
an
independent
manufacturer,
the
randolph
metal
company
to
make
those
lamps
for
sears.
now,
this
all
happened
as
i
say,
stiffel
came
on
the
market
in
1956.
in
1957,
stiffel
came
out
with
two
united
states
patents,
one
a
mechanical
patent
covering
the
mechanical
construction.
the
other,
a
design
patent,
covering
eye
appeal,
as
i
call
it,
and
it
is
the
design
patent
that
brings
us
here
today,
that
is
the
subject
matter,
not
the
design
itself.
stiffel
filed
suit
against
sears
charging
infringement
of
both
the
mechanical
and
the
design
patents,
coupled
along
with
the
charge
of
infringement
was
the
charge
of
unfair
competition.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
subject
matter
of
both
patents
was
clearly
within
the
public
domain.
this
is
not
a
case
of
functionality
or
any
of
that
which
i
heard
in
the
immediately
preceding
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
district
court
found
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
design
patent,
pole
lamps
extending
between
the
floor
and
the
ceiling,
having
a
plurality
of
lamp
sockets
or
fixtures
mounted
there
on
was
clearly
disclosed
and
within
the
public
domain.
it
was
disclosed
in
some
publications
such
as
quick
magazine
which
a
magazine
put
out
by
the
loop
people
back
about
1950
or
1951.
it
was
likewise
disclosed
in
other
publications
available
to
all.
now,
the
district
court
having
found
the
stiffel
pole
lamp
lacking
in
the
prerequisites
essential
of
the
grant
of
a
valid
constitutional
and
statutory
patent
monopoly
for
a
limited
period
of
time
under
the
federal
patent
system
proceeded
to
grant
stiffel
a
perpetual
monopoly
under
the
guise
that
it
was
following
the
illinois
law.
and
it
gave
sears
--
it
gave
to
stiffel
this
perpetual
monopoly
on
the
very
subject
matter
which
it
said
was
in
the
public
domain
and
free
for
everyone
to
use.
now
it's
our
position
--
thank
you
sir.
mr.
will
freeman
--
the
court.
just
before
recess,
i
said
to
this
court
that
both
of
the
patents
below
or
the
patents
were
held
invalid
is
being
within
the
public
domain
and
yet
the
court
following
the
illinois
law
or
what
--
how
it
interpreted
the
illinois
law,
found
that
sears
was
guilty
of
unfair
competition.
in
the
sale
of
pole
lamps
which
were
a
copy
of
that
which
was
in
the
public
domain.
there
was
some
evidence
of
two
buyers.
one,
a
buyer
from
marshall
field,
one
of
the
large
department
stores
in
chicago
and
the
other
is
smithe
company,
furniture
dealers,
likewise
a
very
high
grade
store,
that
someone
had
seen
a
cut
of
a
similar
lamp
in
the
sears
catalog,
listed
at
some
$19
plus,
whereas
they
had
bought
lamps
from
sears
at
some
$40
or
$39.95.
the
same
was
true
with
respect
to
the
smithe
situation,
except
in
that
case,
the
complaining
customer
of
smithe's
had
seen
one
of
the
lamps
in
a
sears
store.
that
was
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
similarity
and
confusion
by
any
customer.
it
was
ranked
hearsay
because
the
buyers
were
saying
what
had
happened.
one
of
the
buyers
from
sear
--
from
marshall
field
wanted
to
know
how
to
explain
to
the
customer
that
there
was
this
difference
between
a
$19
plus
product
and
a
$39
plus
product.
and
we
find
in
the
record
at
page
91
a
complete
explanation
by
the
vice
president
of
the
respondent,
a
mr.
philips
and
i'm
just
going
to
read
with
the
court's
permission,
the
third
paragraph
of
the
letter
of
explanation.
"as
you
know,
it
is
common
practice
for
many
manufacturers
to
copy
expensive
designs
and
sell
to
retailers
at
reduced
cost
by
reducing
the
quality
through
poorer
materials
and
inferior
labor."
now,
the
granting
of
the
perpetual
monopoly
to
mr.
stiffel
gives
him
the
opportunity
of
continuing
to
maintain
his
$40
plus
price
and
precludes
anybody
that
wants
to
buy
a
product
at
less
money
that
will
--
will
serve
the
same
purpose,
it
may
not
be
finished
quite
as
well.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
public
should
be
given
the
privilege
of
determining
for
themselves
whether
they
want
to
buy
a
$20
item
or
buy
a
$40
item.
mr.
will
freeman
no.
i'm
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
the
injunction
states
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
68
of
the
record,
which
is
item
3
in
the
final
judgment.
"defendant
and
its
agents,
representatives
and
employees
are
hereby
enjoined
from
unfairly
competing
with
plaintiff
by
selling
or
attempting
to
sell
pole
lamps
identical
to
or
confusingly
similar
to
plaintiff's
exhibits
3
and
10."
now
to
me,
that
means
that
sears
is
precluded
from
selling
a
copy.
just
in
so
many
words,
that's
the
only
thing
that
can
be
unfair,
if
it
is
legally
unfair,
and
our
position
is
that
it
is
not.
now
--
mr.
will
freeman
it
--
yes,
it
does.
any
pole
lamp
that's
a
copy
--
mr.
will
freeman
that's
a
copy,
yes.
now,
it's
my
position
that
even
if
sears
put
a
large
tag
on
it
or
a
neon
light
sign
saying,
"this
is
manufactured
by,
sold
as
a
product
of
sears",
so
far
as
the
wording
of
this
injunction
is
concerned,
the
commandment
of
this
judgment
is
that
we
cannot
sell
a
copy.
and
anytime
under
state
law
that
you
are
precluded
from
selling
a
copy,
you
are
then
stepping
in
to
the
federal
patent
system
because
you
are
giving
to
the
stiffel
company
more
than
what
they
could
have
gotten
had
their
design
patent
been
valid.
mr.
will
freeman
or
confusingly
similar.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
mr.
will
freeman
either
--
either
one.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
another
is
--
with
--
there
isn't
any
secondary
meaning
in
this
case
your
honor,
none
whatsoever.
we're
just
precluded
from
selling
a
copy.
and
i
say
--
mr.
will
freeman
or
--
or
anything
that's
close
to
it.
now
--
mr.
will
freeman
yes,
it
--
that
doesn't
have
to
be
an
identical
one,
part
per
part,
piece
per
piece,
just
so
--
if
i
saw
one
here
or
that
someone
--
and
saw
another
one.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
we
are
enjoined
from
doing
that
not
for
a
period
of
years
as
would
be
true
in
a
design
patent,
we
would
have
been
enjoined
for
14
years
had
the
design
patent
been
valid.
the
design
patent
was
held
invalid
because
a
pole
lamp,
as
such
was
already
in
the
public
domain.
mr.
will
freeman
if
they
are
correct
in
what
has
been
done
in
this
case,
we
are
barred
from
selling
a
pole
lamp
confusingly
similar
to
or
identical
with
--
mr.
will
freeman
even
after
we're
all
long
gone,
to
mean
it
would
last
for
eternity.
they
have
what
i
would
call
a
perpetual
monopoly.
judge
learned
hand,
in
one
of
his
decisions
in
a
case
where
some
silk
material
was
copied,
made
the
statement
that
this
would
be
the
equivalent
of
giving
to
the
first
to
come
on
the
market
a
patent
right,
a
common
law
patent
right,
that
would
last
forever.
now,
the
state
cannot
do
that
because
the
federal
--
under
the
constitution,
"congress
can
determine
when
it
gives
one
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
copying
or
making
one
confusingly
similar."
that
right
was
given
to
congress
or
by
--
by
--
it
was
given
by
our
constitution
to
congress
and
that
has
been
our
patent
scheme
for
over
a
150
years.
now,
our
--
conceding
for
a
moment
that
the
sears
lamp
sold
by
sears
in
a
sears
store
and
has
advertised,
or
listed
in
its
catalog,
did
not
have
a
tag
on
it.
much
has
been
said
in
this
case
by
the
respondent
that
sears'
product
was
not
tagged.
i
am
sure
no
one
would
want
a
thing
of
beauty
that
should
put
in
your
living
room
or
in
your
bedroom
with
a
nameplate
put
on,
"manufactured
by
or
sold
through
sears."
now,
it's
strange
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeal
--
there
was
no
finding
in
the
lower
court
that
there
was
a
tag
omitted
or
there
was
no
nameplate
on,
no
finding
of
secondary
meaning.
and
yet
our
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
took
upon
themselves
to
say,
"there
was
no
tag
on
the
sears
pole
lamp."
now,
i'll
concede
that
on
the
pole
lamp
itself,
there
was
no
tag
but
the
container
in
which
the
sears
lamp
was
shipped
to
the
respondent,
it
had
a
label
on
it
saying,
"manufactured
by."
and
yet
in
this
particular
case,
respondent
here
says,
"sears
didn't
put
their
name
on
it
nor
the
name
of
the
manufacturer."
and
yet
on
the
very
page
that
they
referred
to
in
this
record,
four
or
five
lines
above,
the
vice
president
of
the
stiffel
company
said
that
when
he
received
the
lamp,
he
knew
who
the
manufacturer
was
because
he
took
the
label
off
of
the
container
in
which
the
lamp
was
shipped
to
them.
mr.
will
freeman
i'm
not
even
--
i'm
not
even
going
that
far,
yes,
sir,
as
a
--
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
feel
that
i
have
a
right
to
copy
--
mr.
will
freeman
--
provided
it
has
not
been
patented
or
copyrighted
or
given
some
kind
of
a
monopoly
which
was
granted
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
will
freeman
on
a
shipping
box.
mr.
will
freeman
no.
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
you
can't
pass
off
your
product
as
the
product
of
another.
mr.
will
freeman
you
can't
palm
it
off.
mr.
will
freeman
there
was
no
palming
off
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
will
freeman
right.
mr.
will
freeman
unless
there's
a
showing
that
there
has
been
confusion.
mr.
will
freeman
but
there
isn't
any
proof
in
our
case
of
that
whatsoever.
mr.
will
freeman
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
will
freeman
he
would've
asked.
he
would've
been
told
no.
mr.
will
freeman
he
bought
it
in
a
sears
store.
he
knew
he
was
getting
sears
--
mr.
will
freeman
--
back
of
it.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct
and
sears
stand
back
of
their
product.
mr.
will
freeman
if
--
if
that
case
were
here
and
someone
just
walked
in
and
said,
"i
want
that
lamp."
i
would
say
that
is
not
dealing
unfairly.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
in
other
words
--
mr.
will
freeman
i
say
that
as
far
as
they
might
compel
us
under
state
law
to
label
so
that
there
would
be
a
clear
identification
that
this
is
the
product.
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
you
can
copy
a
patented
product
after
the
patent
has
expired
and
you
can't
rely
on
unfair
competition
or
anything
else
to
extend
the
monopoly
but
you
have
to
do
so
fairly.
now,
if
it
is
unfair
to
merely
copy,
although
we
say
it
is
not.
it
is
only
unfair
if
you
used
some
skullduggery,
and
i
used
that
word
here,
palming
off
or
the
product
that
acquired
some
of
kind
of
a
significant
meaning
but
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
will
freeman
risk,
yes.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
they
have
that
power.
mr.
will
freeman
that's
not
the
issue
--
mr.
will
freeman
right.
now
incidentally,
in
the
copyright
case
that
was
referred
to
earlier
in
the
preceding
case,
i'm
just
tempted
to
say
what
mr.
ooms
didn't
point
out,
that
in
the
copyright
case,
it
too
was
a
limited
monopoly
granted
by
the
united
states
government
and
not
something
issued
by
the
state
or
made
by
the
state.
i
was
in
that
case
in
this
court,
your
honors.
now
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
comparison
of
the
two
products
and
we'll
concede
that
they
are
very,
very
similar.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
at
all.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
you'd
no
longer
need
palming
off.
you
don't
have
to
acquire
a
secondary
meaning.
if
somebody
is
confused
that
--
and
you
have
copied,
that
is
sufficient
to
make
out
a
case
to
enjoin
the
defendant,
sears
in
this
case,
from
making
and
selling
a
copy.
mr.
will
freeman
it
is
very
unique
with
you
--
with
the
state
of
illinois.
i
know
of
no
other
state
that
goes
so
far
as
to
grant
the
equivalent
of
a
common
law
patent
or
monopoly,
especially
a
monopoly
that
requires
no
prerequisites
as
to
meeting
the
standard
of
invention
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
amp
case
and
other
cases
that
had
followed.
when
you
grant
a
patent
monopoly,
you
give
--
you
give
to
that
individual
a
monopoly
on
the
basis
that
when
the
patent
expires,
all
the
good
will
and
everything
disclosed
in
that
patent
is
free
to
be
used
by
anyone
that
wants
to
use
it.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
they
did
ask
for
a
united
states
patent.
mr.
will
freeman
none
whatsoever.
mr.
will
freeman
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
a
--
a
state
law
that
would
require
labeling
as
you
have
indicated
would
merely
require
--
this
is
the
product
of
sears.
mr.
will
freeman
but
this
--
mr.
will
freeman
it
could
say
that
--
mr.
will
freeman
but
they
haven't
said
it
in
this
case.
that
isn't
the
illinois
law.
mr.
will
freeman
but
they
could've
said
it
and
i
would
then
say
to
your
honor
that
i
think
that
law
would
be
good.
mr.
will
freeman
they
can
lay
down
rules
and
regulations
so
long
as
they
do
not
conflict
with
what
congress
alone
by
our
constitution
has
been
given
the
right
to
convey
to
certain
individuals
in
order
to
exclude
others
from
copying.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
correct.
they
--
they
could
do
that.
in
this
case
though,
we're
not
required
to
do
anything,
we're
just
enjoined
from
making
a
copy,
period.
mr.
will
freeman
what?
mr.
will
freeman
no
--
mr.
will
freeman
no,
this
is
--
mr.
will
freeman
this
is
by
case
law
and
the
case
law
in
illinois
all
originate
under
trademark
law.
mr.
will
freeman
(inaudible)
mr.
will
freeman
no,
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
now,
our
seventh
circuit
turned
to
what
they
call
old-fashioned
honesty
and
they
went
to
trademark
law.
now,
they
have
injected
and
moved
trademark
law
into
design
patent
law.
and
when
they
do
that,
they
then
move
in
to
that
which
is
exclusive,
the
states
gave
up
the
right
to
grant
patents
for
monopolies
a
long,
long
time
ago
and
it's
only
by
our
court
of
appeals
moving
from
trademark
law.
now,
trademark
law
doesn't
keep
you
from
making
a
product
at
all,
it
just
means
you
can't
use
that
particular
name,
the
product
is
still
available.
but
in
this
case,
the
product
is
not
available
so
far
as
this
injunction
is
concerned
regardless
of
what
name
or
how
large
the
tag
is
on
the
product
that
it
is
a
sears
--
mr.
will
freeman
there
was
a
container
in
which
the
product
was
shipped
the
day
the
manufacturer's
name
of
--
as
the
manufacturer
--
mr.
will
freeman
what's
that?
mr.
will
freeman
the
--
i
can't
say
but
there
--
we
can't
question
that.
but
there's
no
finding
by
the
district
court
as
to
that
at
all
and
--
and
it's
--
mr.
will
freeman
(inaudible)
there
was
evidence
but
the
lamp
--
that
when
the
defendant
got
it,
the
lamp
was
bought
in
greensboro,
north
carolina,
shipped
to
the
defendant
in
chicago
and
when
the
defendant
got
it,
there
was
no
tag
on
it.
mr.
will
freeman
plaintiff,
it
was
shipped
to
plaintiff,
your
honors,
i
misspoken.
now,
in
conclusion,
as
i
said,
the
states
relinquished
their
power
in
patent
matters
and
they
gave
that
to
the
federal
government.
whenever
you
have
something
that's
between
state
law
and
federal
law,
the
state
law
must
yield.
this
court
held
that
in
a
recent
case,
sperry
versus
the
state
of
florida,
but
that
has
been
the
pronouncement
of
this
court
in
many,
many
cases.
when
a
patent
monopoly
ends,
the
product
is
free
for
the
public
to
use.
that's
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
granting
of
a
monopoly
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
in
this
case,
the
monopoly
lasts
forever.
now,
in
a
recent
case
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
they
wouldn't
grant
a
trademark
to
someone
because
they
said
it
might
preclude
others
from
copying
and
as
far
as
copying
is
concerned,
you
can
do
that
as
long
as
you
do
it
by
fair
means.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
only
complaint
that
you
have
in
this
case
is
a
matter
of
price.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
following
state
law
cannot
grant
an
injunction
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
perpetual
monopoly.
that
is
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
--
below
in
granting
to
stiffel
a
perpetual
monopoly,
should
be
reversed.
mr.
will
freeman
first
--
mr.
will
freeman
counsel
for
stiffel
said,
"there
was
a
shipping
label
on
the
container
and
no
one
would
be
expected
to
read
it
and
know
who
the
manufacturer
was.
i
find
no
such
statement
in
the
record.
i
do
find,
where
the
--
mr.
philips
of
the
stiffel
company
said,
"i
found
out
who
manufactured
the
sears
lamp
because
i
took
the
label
off."
it
doesn't
say
it's
a
shipping
label
or
what
it
is.
it's
the
label
with
the
manufacturer's
name.
now,
insofar
as
sears
is
concerned
with
respect
to
a
--
going
back
for
a
modified
injunction
permitting
us
to
put
labels
on.
let's
assume
for
a
moment
that
sears
does
absolutely
nothing.
it
doesn't
sell
this
particular
lamp,
it
just
does
nothing.
the
precedent
still
stands
that
one
who
copies
in
the
state
of
illinois
can
be
enjoined
perpetually
from
so
doing.
that's
the
injunction
and
insofar
as
counsel
for
stiffel
is
concerned,
they
agree
as
a
matter
of
law
that
once
a
patent
has
expired,
you
can
copy
the
subject
matter
of
the
patent.
and
they
attempt
to
distinguish
on
page
12
of
their
brief
where
they
say,
"sears
copied
the
product."
but
if
your
honors
will
look
at
a
copy
of
the
design
patent
which
we
find
at
page
71
of
this
record,
you
will
find
that
the
design
patent
in
the
product
are
one
and
the
same,
so
we're
quibbling
over
words.
so
long
as
you
copy
the
design
patent,
is
--
which
has
been
held
invalid,
you
can
be
enjoined.
now,
that's
exactly
what
this
injunction
means.
it
means
we
can't
sell
a
copy
or
one
confusingly
similar
thereto.
this
case
should
be
reversed.
mr.
will
freeman
well
i
think
it's
just
a
waste
of
time,
your
honor.
it
can
go
back.
i
can't
tell
this
court
what
to
do.
i
can
plead
with
them.
mr.
will
freeman
well
it's
--
it's
the
only
state
so
far
as
i
know
and
we've
done
a
lot
research.
this
goes
much
further
than
any
other
state,
insofar
as
what
you
have
to
do.
mr.
will
freeman
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
will
freeman
what
was
that?
mr.
will
freeman
one
was
ordered
but
held
in
advance
pending
the
outcome
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
will
freeman
our
position
is
that
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
it
can
do
nothing
that
it's
in
conflict
with
the
patent
statutes
which
are
exclusively
within
the
domain
of
the
federal
government.
and
what
it
has
done
here,
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
has
done
has
set
up
the
equivalent
of
a
perpetual
patent
instead
of
giving
one
that
requires
certain
constitutional
prerequisites,
what
constitutes
invention.
and
thereafter,
saying
that,
"when
the
patent
expires
for
any
cause
that
it
is
free
and
within
the
public
domain."
the
--
the
court
below
found
the
subject
matter
to
be
in
the
public
domain
so
mr.
stiffel
never
got
any
rights
to
start
with.
mr.
will
freeman
thank
you.
mr.
will
freeman
no,
i'm
not
saying
we
should've
labeled
it
at
all.
i
think
the
broad
position
--
sure
you
cannot
compete
unfairly
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
with
which
we
wholeheartedly
agree.
but
the
act
of
merely
copying
and
nothing
more
is
not
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
constitutes
unfair
competition
for
which
the
state
of
illinois
--
following
the
state
of
illinois
law,
a
patent
monopoly
or
the
equivalent
of
the
patent
monopoly
can
be
granted
for
eternity.
mr.
will
freeman
they
--
they
can
set
up
certain
rules
within
--
yes,
because
--
mr.
will
freeman
the
state
could
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
will
freeman
if
that's
all
they
did,
we
--
it
would
not
preempt
anything
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
will
freeman
that
is
right.
