mr.
warren
c.
horton
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices.
appearing
for
the
stiffel
company,
the
respondent
here,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
or
to
assert
really
some
matters
of
fact
which
are
not
mentioned
by
my
opponent.
the
stiffel
company,
at
the
time
that
it
first
brought
out
its
pole
lamp,
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
3.
certainly,
in
which
they
thought
it
was
a
new
product,
it
was
its
own
design
and
it
did
show
that
at
the
furniture
show
in
chicago
in
january
1956.
the
sears
company
stated,
by
their
own
executives
who
testified
that
they
observed
--
they
watched
the
advent
of
the
pole
lamp
with
great
interest
and
when
they
saw,
that
they
thought
that
it
was
moving
in
a
mass
market
direction,
they
decided
to
move
in.
now,
the
manner
in
which
sears
moved
in
was
to
take
a
picture
of
plaintiff's
--
stiffel's
pole
and
take
it
to
a
manufacturer
in
philadelphia
and
have
him
make
what
was
almost
an
exact
replica
of
the
stiffel
pole
lamp.
in
this
structure,
there
are
of
course
functional
elements,
the
elements
which
make
the
lamps
operate,
the
switches,
the
connections
between
the
sections,
the
springs
at
the
top
which
hold
it
to
the
ceiling.
but
there
are
also
a
good
many
decorative
features
which
are
not
functional
features,
such
as
the
particular
handle,
the
size,
the
shape
of
that,
the
shape
and
size
of
the
metal,
the
--
even
the
perforations
on
the
metal
which
are
strictly
decorative.
sears
copied
all
those
items
exactly.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
i
have
to
look
at
the
label,
your
honor.
but
this
one
is
sears.
i
know
it
because
it
--
it
isn't
the
real
(inaudible)
mr.
warren
c.
horton
the
one
in
my
left,
sears,
one
in
my
right
hand
is
the
stiffel.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
this
one,
which
i
am
now
holding
is
the
stiffel
product
and
the
one
which
mr.
(inaudible)
is
holding
is
the
sears.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir,
the
same.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
that
base
is
put
in
there
and
screwed
in
so
that
it
can
be
screwed
down
and
adjusted
to
make
the
pole
tight
against
the
floor.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
it
screws
into
or
out
of
this
lay
--
a
lower
extension
of
the
pole.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
at
the
top
section,
that
is
under
its
compression
springs
and
you
push
that
up
against
the
ceiling
and
--
of
the
room
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
and
compress
that
spring
a
little
and
let
it
down
and
it's
then
held
in
place.
and
if
you
need
some
further
adjustment,
why,
you
can
adjust
the
screw
button
up
or
down
in
order
to
make
it
tighter.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
it
--
we
don't
know
of
any
be
--
before
it
which
had
separate
sections
so
that
it
could
be
dismounted
and
shipped
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
--
and
in
which
the
wiring
was
completely
concealed
within
the
pole
and
not
looped
out
to
the
individual
lamps.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
oh
yes,
poles
which
were
used
for
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
--
other
purposes.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
have
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
that
completely
concealed
like
this.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
we
thought
there
was
and
the
patent
office
thought
so
but
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes.
and
the
patent
office
held
that
it
was
patentable
and
issued
two
patents
of
it,
one,
a
mechanical
patent
and
one,
a
design
patent
on
the
appearance
of
the
pole.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
and
--
that's
correct.
it
does
have
this
--
a
bearing
however.
petitioner
says
that
the
courts
below
held
the
patents
in
suit
to
be
invalid
and
then
granted
to
the
plaintiff,
the
same
relief
under
the
guise
of
unfair
competition,
that
is
not
wholly
correct.
before
the
trial
court,
there
were
10
models
of
lamps
made
by
or
for
sears
and
sold
by
sears
which
were
charged
to
infringe
both
the
mechanical
patent
and
the
design
patent
in
suit.
the
court
found
that
in
fact
all
10
models
did
in
fact
infringe
both
patents
if
they
were
valid,
but
said
that
both
patents
were
invalid
for
lack
of
invention
over
the
art
which
was
found.
now,
in
demanding
the
injunction
against
unfairly
competing,
the
injunction
ran
only
against
one
of
those
10
models
made
for
and
sold
by
sears.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
9
out
10
of
the
accused
structures
before
the
court
are
not
enjoined
or
restrained
in
any
way.
sears
is
perfectly
free
to
make
them,
insofar
as
i
know,
it
still
does.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
they
were
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
there
was
no
--
they
were
not
made
in
the
manner
of
direct
copying
from
a
product
of
the
stiffel
company.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes
sir.
they
were
--
they
were
slightly
different
in
shades,
or
slightly
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
your
honor,
i
should
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
as
to
any
confusion
or
any
copying
as
to
those
other
nine
models.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
there
was
about
the
10th.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
this
one
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well
we
thought
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
they
were
close
enough
copies
so
that
the
court
said
that
if
the
patents
were
valid,
they
would
infringe
both
patents
including
the
design
patent
but
if
the
patents
weren't
valid
and
therefore,
they
did
not
infringe.
so
that,
it
is
not
true
however
to
say
that
the
court
under
the
guise
of
unfair
competition
granted
the
same
relief
which
the
plaintiff
sought
under
the
patents
which
were
held
invalid.
after
the
stiffel
company
had
decided
to
move
in
with
this
copy
of
the
stiffel
lamp
pole,
the
--
the
stiffel
company
purchased
two
of
the
poles
like
plaintiff's
exhibit
10
and
purchased
them
in
greensboro,
north
carolina.
now,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
absolute,
at
page
28,
that
there
was
no
marking
and
no
labeling
of
that
pole
nor
the
package.
they
--
there
were
--
there
was
one
of
them
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
sir?
mr.
warren
c.
horton
as
it
--
as
it
left
the
manufacturer
or
in
the
hands
of
sears.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
neither
on
the
floor
samples
or
any
way.
that
inside
the
package,
the
only
thing
which
was
there
besides
the
physical
object
itself,
was
the
instruction
sheet
which
appears
at
page
93
of
the
record
in
which
itself
is
absolutely
anonymous
and
bears
no
name
whatsoever,
either
of
the
manufacturer
or
of
sears.
now,
in
the
--
the
testimony
that
there
was
no
such
labeling
was
at
no
way
disputed,
countered
in
any
way
by
the
sears
people,
they
were
there
at
the
trial,
they
did
not
deny
it
or
question
it
in
any
way.
it
has
been
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
issues
which
are
raised
before
the
court
in
this
case
--
or
it
could
be
a
more
complex
than
are
the
actual
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
that
was
the
shipping
label.
now,
that
--
that
was
a
shipping
label
from
randolph
metals
to
the
sears,
roebuck
store
in
greensboro,
north
carolina.
now,
the
person
who
knew
that
was
the
stiffel
company.
the
stiffel
company
of
course
knew
that
it
had
not
made
the
product
for
sears.
and
being
in
the
lamp
manufacturing
business,
it
knew
who
randolph
metal
company
was.
but
that
certainly
would
not
apply
to
an
ordinary
customer,
member
--
ordinary
member
of
the
public
and
--
and
in
no
way
was
the
product
itself
marked
nor
was
there
any
--
any
marking
on
--
on
the
product
or
inside
the
box
with
the
product
which
would
state
its
origin
either
by
from
the
manufacturer
or
from
sears.
now,
both
courts
below
did
find
that
there
was
actual
confusion
as
to
origin
of
the
goods
which
were
sold
by
sears
and
that
there
was
likelihood
a
confusion.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
think
if
it
were
a
close
enough
copy
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
certainly
would
be
true.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
cannot
see
the
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
i
am
--
i
am
but
i
want
--
to
do
what?
to
associate
it
with
the
patents.
and
--
and
the
reason
is,
that
this
court
has
established
what
the
standards
should
be
in
that
--
in
this
action
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
--
the
real
crux
of
this
thing
as
in
the
--
the
court
held
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
it's
a
matter
of
failure
to
mark,
and
to
identify
the
product
as
to
source.
now
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
if
they
had
done
that,
then
i
think
that
they
would
undoubtedly
have
been
able
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
get
a
modification
of
the
injunction
or
get
it
lifted.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
if
they
did
it,
well
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir.
there
is
no
fair
trade
law
in
illinois.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
they
would
--
they
had
not.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
clearly
identify
the
source.
now,
i
say
that
because
the
patents
are
no
longer
enforceable
against
sears.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes,
but
that
he
has
not
done
them,
that
they
have
not
agreed
to
do
it.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
say
that's
the
law.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
and
that
has
been
decided
by
both
courts
below
in
the
same
way
that
they
did
not
mark.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
from
unfair
competition
in
the
copying
of
the
product
and
the
unfair
competition
includes
us
an
element
be
fair
to
mark
as
the
source.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well
i
say
that
they've
got
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
say
they've
got
a
right
to
go
to
the
court
any
time
and
ask
for
a
modification
of
the
injunction,
if
they
have
done
something
like
that
which
makes
their
action
then
within
the
fair
definition.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
i
think
an
element
of
the
unfair
competition
that
was
found
and
which
is
part
of
the
injunctive
order
in
the
decree
is
that
the
unfair
competition.
and
i
say
that
the
failure
to
mark
and
identify
as
the
source
is
an
element
of
that
as
found
in
the
court.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
and
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
he
doesn't
say
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
he
seems
to
say
that
today.
he
does
not
say
so
in
his
briefs
in
this
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
thing
is
controlled
by
this
--
to
this
court's
decision
in
singer
manufacturing
versus
june
manufacturing
company
in
163
u.s.
169
and
which
principle
was
followed
by
this
court
in
kellogg
versus
the
national
biscuit
company,
305
u.s.
111.
now,
if
we
assume
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
sir?
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
that
would
involve
a
question
as
to
what
they
did
actually
sell
without
labeling
and
on
the
strength
of
its
confusing
similarity
with
the
stiffel
company's
goods.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
well,
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
that
but
you
can
get
the
profit
needs
from
the
unfair
competition
or
the
damage
sustained
in
which
the
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
can
prove,
which
is
a
very
difficult
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
of
that
one
particular
model.
and
i
--
i
might
say
--
mr.
warren
c.
horton
--
that
they
take
--
they
say
that
there
are
only
2500
of
them.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
not
under
illinois
statutes.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no.
not
under
any
illinois
statutes.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
no,
sir.
i
say
there
is
no
--
no
provision
for
obtaining
the
attorney's
fees
(voice
overlap).
mr.
warren
c.
horton
only
in
patent
cases.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
c.
horton
yes,
that's
correct.
and
the
--
it
is
up
to
the
court.
in
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
stiffel
company
who's
--
ought
not
to
be
in
any
worse
position
than
if
it
had
enjoyed
its
patents
for
their
full
term
and
they
had
expired.
actually,
it
didn't
at
all
but
in
the
singer
case
where
the
patents
had
expired,
the
defendant
was
making
an
exact
copy
of
the
singer
sewing
machine.
and
it
--
the
court
said
--
this
court
said
that
it
has
--
the
general
public
had
a
right
to
copy
the
subject
matter
of
an
expired
patent.
therefore,
they
have
that
right
but
that
it
had
to
be
done
fairly
and
there
had
to
be
such
indications
that
the
thing
manufactured
is
the
work
of
the
one
making
it,
as
well
unmistakably,
inform
the
public
of
that
fact
but
we
think
that's
controlling
here.
the
same
principle
was
applied
by
this
court
in
the
kellogg
case
versus
national
biscuit
company,
where
they
said
that
surely
they
had
the
right
to
copy
the
subject
matter
of
an
expired
patent
but
they
must
do
so
fairly.
and
fairness
requires
that
it'd
be
done
in
a
manner
which
reasonably
distinguishes
its
product
from
that
of
the
plaintiff.
we
think
that
that
is
the
rule
which
is
applicable
here
and
that
it's
only
real
issue
in
this
case.
