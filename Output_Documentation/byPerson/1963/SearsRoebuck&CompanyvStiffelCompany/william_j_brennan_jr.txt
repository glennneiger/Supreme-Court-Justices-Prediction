the

justice

and
no

neither

--
whoever
that
witness
was,
i
found
out
who
manufactured
the
sears
lamp
because
i
took
the
label
off
the
carton
in
the
sears
pole
lamp
payment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
is
this
the
--
and
this
is
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
this
the
only
difference
between
--
then
your
adversary
says
that
even
though
he
never
marked
the
extent
of
any
injunctive
relief,
would
there
have
been
relief
requiring
him
to
mark
them?
that's
what
he
says.
you
say,
"no",
because
he
never
marked
them.
the
court
would
justify
it
in
enjoining
him
from
copying
it
all
and
someday
when
he
starts
marking,
he'd
come
back
and
get
the
injunction
modified.
justice
william

brennan,

(voice
overlap)
to
be
about
all
the
difference
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
to
suggest
that
the
state
of
illinois
could
not
require
you
to
identify
it
as
a
sears'
item.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
state,
notwithstanding
your
preemption
argument,
has
no
power
or
whatever.
you
say
the
power
is
limited
to
requiring
you
to
identify
the
items
someway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
all
they
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
rule
in
the
illinois
was
that
if
you
copy
and
--
if
you
copy
somebody,
you've
got
to
identify
you're
the
source.
and
a
--
grant
and
--
and
you
copied,
and
you
didn't
identify
and
the
injunction
that
was
issued
simply
enjoins
you
from
copying
and
not
identifying,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
