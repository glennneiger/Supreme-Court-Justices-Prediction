mr.
o.
john
rogge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
body
execution
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
my
position
that
it
does
and
in
support
of
that
position,
i
am
going
to
suggest
an
approach
to
the
due
process
clause
which
i
think
is
in
accord
with
its
intervening
and
historical
development
which
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
less
inclusive
than
what
has
been
called
the
incorporation
theory
based
upon
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
with
the
concurrence
of
mr.
justice
douglas
and
also
the
concurrence
on
this
point
of
justices
murphy
and
rutledge
in
adamson
against
california
and
on
the
other
hand,
is
more
inclusive.
i
say
less
inclusive
because
i
don't
think
it's
historically
correct
to
say
that
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1866
anymore
than
the
barons
already
made
almost
three
quarters
of
a
millennium
earlier
when
they
exacted
from
king
john.
he
promised
not
to
go
against
them
except
by
the
law
of
the
land
that
they
thought
about
it
specifically
what
it
meant
other
than
it
meant
to
do
right.
i
don't
think
it's
historically
correct
to
say
therefore
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
itself
incorporated
the
first
state
amendments
and
made
them
applicable
to
the
states.
on
the
other
hand,
i
submit
that
the
due
process
clause
does
represent
the
better
angel
of
our
nature
and
therefore
shouldn't
be
limited
to
the
first
state
amendment.
for
example,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
if
it
were
not
there,
can
there
be
any
doubt
but
that
today
justice
that's
not
even
handed
would
be
struck
down
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
in
the
thirteenth
amendment,
for
instance,
the
provision
against
involuntary
servitude
except
for
those
who've
been
convicted
of
a
crime
after
a
due
trial.
if
it
were
not
there,
can
it
be
any
doubt
--
can
there
be
any
doubt
but
that
today
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
there
couldn't
be
involuntary
servitude.
on
that
basis
--
on
that
approach,
i
submit
that
the
body
execution
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
five
different
grounds.
it
violates
it
because
it
imposes
the
punishment
without
the
incidence
of
a
criminal
trial.
there
was
a
default
judgment
in
this
case
never
anything
more.
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
in
the
second
place
because
the
body
execution
statute
which
was
section
764
of
the
civil
practice
act
bears
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
ends,
the
legislature
had
in
mind
when
they
enacted.
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
in
the
third
place
because
when
this
body
execution
statute
is
taken
together
with
a
couple
of
sections
of
the
new
york
correction
law,
it
denies
the
petitioner
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
a
rich
man
won't
have
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months
the
way
my
client
will
if
he
goes
back
to
new
york.
he's
not
in
new
york.
he
had
to
leave
new
york
a
minute
that
order
for
body
execution
was
entered.
therefore,
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
denied
him
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
in
the
fourth
place,
this
section
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
imposes
upon
him
a
cruel
and
an
unusual
punishment.
and
in
the
fifth
place,
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
imposes
upon
him
involuntary
services.
now,
before
i
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
there
are
two
nagging
procedural
questions
that
i'd
like
to
deal
with.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
says
that
i
did
and
exhaust
state
court
remedies
in
new
york.
i
say
that
i
did.
he
says
that
i
don't
have
a
final
judgment.
i
say
that
i
do
but
i
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you
had
in
this
case
a
judgment
of
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice
gellinoff
who
ordered
that
execution
be
issued
here
and
against
the
person
of
morris
gotthilf
defendant
herein
without
notice
to
said
defendant.
had
my
client
stayed
in
new
york?
he
didn't.
the
sheriff
could
had
seized
him
and
put
him
in
prison
for
six
months.
i
say
that
under
any
normal
concept
and
indeed,
under
the
language
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
itself
in
those
few
instances
where
it
took
time
out
to
give
us
--
give
us
a
few
lines
of
opinion
that
was
the
final
judgment.
certainly
that
it's
the
final
judgment
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1257.
now,
if
it's'
a
final
judgment,
then
i
submit
that
i
exhausted
state
court
remedies
by
trying
to
go
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
the
only
two
ways
that
i
could
go
there,
if
it's
a
final
judgment,
(a)
by
docketing
an
appeal
of
the
right
because
i
have
a
constitutional
question,
(b)
by
making
emotion
for
leave
to
go
there
supported
by
printed
affidavits
and
a
printed
brief.
these
were
denied,
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
i
didn't
have
a
final
judgment.
if
i
didn't'
have
a
final
judgment,
then
i
say
i
didn't
have
a
right
to
go
there
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
exhausted
state
court
remedies
by
going
to
the
appellate
division,
first
department.
so
i
say
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york,
they
can
play
games
with
words
if
they
wanted.
whether
or
not
it
--
they
call
it
a
final
judgment,
makes
no
difference,
if
it's
final,
i
exhausted
state
court
remedies
by
trying
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
by
some
part
of
new
york
law
that
final
judgment
isn't
the
final
judgment,
then
i
exhausted
state
court
remedies
by
going
to
the
appellate
division,
second
department.
but
beyond
all
this,
i
say
that
what
i
really
come
down
to
here
is
the
language
of
28
u.s.c.
section
1257
and
then
under
that,
it
is
a
final
judgment
and
here,
i
would
rely
especially
on
the
case
that
the
new
york
attorney
general
cites
in
his
brief,
republic
natural
gas
company
against
oklahoma
and
i
deal
with
it
in
the
reply
brief
on
page
14
where
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
said,
"there
had
been
instances
where
the
court
has
entertained
an
appeal
of
an
order
that
otherwise
might
be
deemed
interlocutory
because
the
controversy
had
proceeded
to
a
point
where
a
losing
party
would
be
irreparably
injured
if
review
were
unavailing."
if
this
court
does
not
give
relief,
my
client,
the
petitioner,
gotthilf,
can
never
go
back
to
the
state
of
new
york
because
there
is
an
order
for
body
execution
under
which
he'd
have
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
there
is
no
escape
from
that.
he
can't
make
bar.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
the
only
way
he
could
have
escaped
it.
he
hasn't
got
it,
so
he
has
to
go
to
jail.
the
rich
man
might
be
able
to
pass.
so
he's
denied
if,
your
honor
please,
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
the
judgment
like
this,
rendered
against
a
rich
man,
he
could
pay
it.
so
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
jail.
my
client
can't
pay
it,
therefore,
he
has
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes,
he
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
he
doesn't
have
to
--
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
jail.
my
client
has
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
he
doesn't
pay
this
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
--
default
judgment,
he
has
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
even
in
a
criminal
case
that
couldn't
happen
without
a
trial.
this
is
punishable,
the
same
as
criminal
punishment
without
the
benefits
of
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
why
do
i
have
to
go
to
that?
i've
got
a
final
judgment.
i
exhausted
state
court
remedies.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
right.
he's
not
in
new
york.
he
is
in
florida.
i
mean,
i'm
here,
this
case
is
ready
for
decision.i
either
get
relief
now
or
my
client
never
have
it.
and
your
honor
is
right.
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
he's
not
in
custody.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
the
meantime,
he'd
be
in
jail.
now,
there
is
a
second
procedural
question
here.
the
money
execution
statute
which
was
section
764
of
the
civil
practice
act
was
superseded
on
september
1,
1963
by
something
that
new
york
lawyers
called
cplr,
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
and
if
you
look
at
the
cross-reference
table
in
the
beginning,
they
tell
you
that
section
764
has
been
omitted.
but
they
cross-reference
you
to
section
6111
and
i
say
that's
even
worse
because
that
section
provides
that
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
this
order
of
arrest
may
be
granted
without
notice
before
or
after
service
of
summons
and
at
anytime
before
or
after
judgment.
now,
they
call
that
a
provisional
remedy.
i
say
what's
provisional
about
that,
because
the
same
people
can
seize
him,
lodge
him
in
the
same
jail
for
the
same
length
of
time.
this
time
i
say
to
the
state
of
new
york,
let's
not
play
games
with
words.
you
have
the
same
situation
today
that
you
did
before
september
1,
1963,
so
that
we
really
get
down
to
the
question
whether
my
client
is
to
have
relief
here
and
now
by
a
holding
that
section
764
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
there
was
one
other
possibility
if
this
was
a
non
final
judgment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
without
any
reasoning.
if
you
will
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
that's
one
it
said
in
this
particular
case
contrary
to
what
--
contrary
to
its
own
language
in
any
case
where
it
had
ever
spoken
out,
but
this
wasn't
something
as
of
right.
here,
i
would
have
to
go
to
an
appellant
division
to
which
i
had
gone
twice
before,
first
to
try
to
get
the
default
set
aside.
and
they
affirmed
no
opinion,
not
a
line
of
opinion,
not
a
sentence.
i
then
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
an
argue
that
section
764
is
unconstitutional
at
least
in
a
memorandum
opinion
mr.
justice
gellinoff
gives
me
one
sentence.
he
said
section
764
of
the
cpa
constitutional.
once
again,
i
go
back
to
the
appellate
division.
once
again,
there
is
an
affirmance
and
ones
again
not
a
line
of
opinion.
now,
what
the
attorney
general
suggests
is
that
i
could
have
gone
to
that
court
if
it
were
a
non-final
judgment
and
i
say
that
looking
at
new
york
opinions
up
to
that
point
and
by
any
rational
approach,
this
was
a
final
judgment.
you
couldn't
get
anything
more
final.
there
was
nothing
more
that
remained
to
be
done.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
they
didn't'
say
that.
they
dismissed
the
appeal
after
the
time
to
ask
the
appellate
division
for
leave
to
appeal,
something
which
i
think
would
have
made
me
look
fully
channelling.
to
go
to
a
court
that
has
--
before
whom
i've
been
twice
and
they
haven't
given
me
a
line
of
opinion.
and
if
you
look
at
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
up
to
this
point
if
nothing
more
remained
to
be
done
and
nothing
more
remained
to
be
done,
you'll
have
under
any
rational
approach
of
final
order
because
if
the
sheriff
could
have
seized
my
man,
he
could
have
gone
to
jail
immediately
and
he
would
have
lodged
there
for
six
months.
now,
i
submit
that
i
did
everything
that
could
reasonably
be
affected,
to
exhaust
state
court
remedy
unless
one
has
to
file
appeals
in
every
reviewing
court
inside
and
i
hope
that
you
don't
miss
the
right
way.
but
i
say
one
thing
more,
i
had
and
under
the
attorney
general's
hypothesis,
that
it
wasn't
the
final
judgment
and
i
had
no
right
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
unless
the
appellate
division
--
and
this
is
really
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
and
when
i
submit
that
under
any
reasonable
approach,
i
did
everything
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
and
exhausting
state
court
remedies
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
local
174
against
lucas
flour
company
where
they
distinguished
the
case,
the
garmon
case
that
new
york's
attorney
general
relies
on,
emphasizes
that
i
didn't
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
all
that
i
could
--
all
that
i
could
additionally
have
done
and
your
honor
is
right
i
could
have
done
that,
is
to
go
to
a
court
which
summarily
threw
me
out
and
do
what
to
my
mind
look
like
the
foulest
thing
of
saying,
"please,
now,
i
want
something
that
you
don't
want
to
pay
any
attention
too
and
you
give
me
leave
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals."
this
would
have
been
a
futile
thing
to
do.
it
could
have
been
done.
by
now,
it's
not
there.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
think
it
is.
i
mean
this
is
something
--
if
this
is
some
--
then
--
then
i've
exhausted,
i
--
i
say
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
would
say
that's
right.
yes.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
i
did
everything
that
a
person
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
do
to
exhaust
state
court
remedies
there
and
furthermore
that
they
exhausted
the
petitioner.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
think
there
might
be
circumstances
and
this
case
is
one
of
them.
and
i
say
here
i
fall
under
the
republic
case
that
there
are
instances
whether
the
court
has
entertained
an
appeal
from
an
order
that
might
otherwise
be
deemed
interlocutory.
i
did.
i
submit
what
could
reasonably
be
expected.
i
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
only
two
ways
that
i
thought
you
could
go
there
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
final
order
which
is
what
it
looked
like
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
now
in
a
position
where
if
i
have
to
have
relief,
i
have
to
have
at
the
hands
of
this
court.
there's
no
other
place
i
can
go.
there's
no
--
and
my
client
will
forever
be
precluded
from
going
back
to
the
state
of
new
york.
he
had
to
put
on
his
hat
back
and
back
and
what
is
likely
of
the
state
and
he
can't
go
back.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
right,
right,
right.
no
--
and
he
could
post
bond
and
double
the
amount
which
my
client
handled.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
oh,
yes,
yes.
that's
known
under
the
situation
in
this
case.
now,
what
you
have
here
--
mr.
o.
john
rogge
unless
he
either
make
bond
and
double
the
amount
or
paid.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
liberties
of
the
jail.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
think
you
make
bond
and
double
the
amount.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
yes
and
he
can't
do
it.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
he
--
what
he
has
done,
i
don't
have
his
address
with
me.
i
have
it
at
the
office.
but
here
was
a
man
who
was
a
leading
cpa
and
who
is
now
as
he
can,
trying
to
practice
accounting
in
the
--
and
i
think
he's
in
north
miami.
and
he's
been
there
since
this
judgment
was
entered.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
back
just
a
moment
to
the
controversy
itself.
the
original
controversy
arose
out
of
a
factoring
agreement
and
the
one
who
actually
lend
the
money
was
the
corporation,
the
corporate
defendant
of
which
the
petitioner
was
chairman
of
the
board.
and
there
was
at
one
time
when
the
plaintiff
corporation
was
embedded
to
the
defendant
corporation
in
the
amount
of
sum
$22,000
and
for
this,
they
had
a
collateral
sum
$28,000
which
according
to
the
defendant
$23,000
that
was
worth
was
collateral.
they
entered
into
an
agreement
by
which
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
that
action
were
to
pay
$13,000
and
i
think
they
did
and
the
defendant
was
to
make
certain
collections
and
turn
them
over
for
taxes,
and
i
understand
he
didn't.
however,
that
maybe,
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
the
judgment
here
is
the
result
of
a
default
order
and
that
arose
of
a
misunderstanding
between
counsels.
the,
then,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
archibald
palmer
swears
that
he
had
an
understanding
with
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
that
the
default
would
only
be
entered
as
to
the
corporate
defendant
and
not
the
individual.
mr.
theodore
charnas
whose
admission
i
moved
this
morning
and
for
whom
i
have
a
high
regard
says
he
never
had
any
such
understanding.
now,
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
lawyer
for
a
client
who
has
a
good
defense
and
the
defense
there
among
other
things
despite
all
the
charges
and
counter
charges.
the
defense
among
other
things
would
have
been
to
whatever
the
petitioner
did,
he
did
in
a
corporate
capacity
as
chairman
of
the
board,
indeed
the
complaint
itself
have
allegations
saying
that
the
defendant
by
gotthilf,
the
petitioner
here
did
certain
things.
i
mean
it's
conceivable
to
me
that
a
lawyer
would
have
consented
to
a
default
order
not
only
to
the
corporation
but
also
to
the
individual
defendant.
however,
that
maybe,
i
don't
know
what
the
facts
are.
they're
disputed
one
side
on
the
other.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
default
order
was
entered
as
to
both
the
corporate
and
the
individual
defendant.
and
thereafter
on
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
division
to
try
and
get
that,
default
order
set
aside.
the
appellate
division
affirmed
without
opinion.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
in
that
appeal
to
the
appellate
division,
i
argue
that
the
default
should
be
set
aside.
i
did
not
--
at
that
point,
we
still
weren't
faced
with
the
motion
for
body
execution.
now,
when
i
raised
the
point
about
section
764,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
point
at
that
point.
i
mean
764
is
for
body
execution,
not
i
think
the
body.
it
was
not
raised
there.
we
now
get
back
to
the
trial
court.
and
now,
i
do
make
a
full
scale
argument
and
incidentally
under
the
statute,
they
could
have
picked
up
the
petitioner
without
notice
except
that,
as
i
recall
it,
i
had
an
understanding
with
mr.
charnas
that
he
would
do
it
on
motion
so
that
i
could
make
my
constitutional
argument,
and
he
did
make
it
on
motion.
and
at
that
point,
i
did
have
a
full
scale
argument
before
on
mr.
justice
gellinoff
that
section
764
violated
the
due
process
clause.
and
as
i
say,
he
gave
me
one
line
in
his
memorandum
on
that.
and
i
argued
that
same
question
in
just
as
extensive
of
brief
before
the
appellate
division,
first
department
and
they
didn't
give
me
a
line.
they
simply
said
affirmed
no
thing.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
you
do
if
your
honor
please
and
i
want
to
say
to
your
honor
that
this
business
of
the
judge's
discretion
in
this
particular
thing
was
a
fearful
situation.
there
was
a
petitioner
with
his
wife
pleading
with
mr.
justice
gellinoff.
he
wanted
to
know
where
is
the
car,
where
is
the
pearl,
where
are
the
jewels,
where
are
the
sons,
where
are
the
family
who
can
come
forward
here
with
money.
and
he
ended
up
by
saying,
"pay
half
of
it
now
and
good
security
for
the
balance
or
you
go
to
jail."
mr.
o.
john
rogge
not
one
word
that
i
can
find
it.
it
simply
says
in
his
discretion,
and
it
was
a
practical
thing
in
this
particular
case.
i,
of
course,
go
much
beyond
that
or
the
five
reasons
that
i've
advanced
here.
i
think
the
only
way
to
handle
this
situation
and
to
declare
of
section
764
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
one
or
more
of
the
five
grounds
that
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
about
half
in
limited
classifications.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
new
york
is
one
of
that
limited
category
cases
which
still
has
this
out
motive
thing
that
you
can
either
say
to
it
better,
the
judge
can.
your
honor
please,
it's
not
handing
to
them
on
a
silver
platter,
handing
it
to
them
a
golden
platter
and
that's
what
the
plaintiff
and
plaintiff's
lawyer
wanted
in
this
case.
they
wanted
the
judge,
there
are
ways
you
can
go,
i
mean
the
rest
of
it
where
we
try
to
collect
that
that
there
are
supplementary
proceedings,
there
are
attachment,
there
are
garnishments,
there
are
these
various
ways
in
which
we
can
find
out
whether
the
debtor
has
money
or
property
or
anything
else
and
seize
it."
but
no,
not
here,
the
creditor
wanted
the
whole
amount
handed
on,
on
a
golden
platter
and
mr.
justice
gellinoff
accommodated
him
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
o.
john
rogge
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
challenge
the
statements
that
there
is
any
case
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
any
place
else
in
the
state
of
new
york
which
says
that
if
you
make
a
full
disclosure,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
jail.
there
isn't
any
such
case
or
i've
overlooked
it.
now,
when
counsel
says,
"full
disclosure
wasn't
made
them
in
this
affidavit,"
he's
also
attacking
me
because
i
sat
down
with
the
client
and
helped
him
prepare
those
affidavits.
and
your
honors
will
find
the
first
one
at
pages
--
of
the
record,
pages
10
to
15.
and
i
end
up
by
saying
there
and
i
thought
this
was
a
good
affidavit.
he
has
to
point
out
he
is
a
certified
public
accountant.
and
he
says,
"i
am
present
and
available
for
any
supplementary
proceedings
which
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
may
wish
to
conduct
and
i
will
continue
to
be
present."
he
offers
to
pull
his
bond
to
be
present.
the
judge
said
that
it
isn't
good
enough.
i
prepared
a
supplementary
affidavit
and
this
is
one
at
pages
21
and
22,
and
i
think
i
know
how
to
ask
questions.
i
asked
him,
"what's
he
got,
does
he
have
office
furniture?
does
he
have
an
automobile?
does
his
wife
have
a
fur
coat?"
incidentally,
the
judge
asked
all
those
questions
in
chambers
too.
he
didn't
have
anything
except
his
income.
so
i
prepared
a
supplemental
affidavit
in
which
i
--
in
which
i
say
to
the
judge
in
his
file,
"i
have
no
assets
and
the
only
income
that
i
received
is
from
my
business."
he
puts
in
there
what
his
income
is
for
the
last
four
years.
this
was
a
disastrous
venture
form.
he
lost
everything
he
had
and
his
wife
had.
i
then
go
in
and
i
argued
with
him.
i
said,
"let's
offer
a
25%
of
net
income."
he
then
wanted
--
before
or
after
taxes.
i
said,
"don't
push
with
that,
offer
a
straight
25%
from
now
on
of
what
you
make."
but
i
said,
"let's
put
in
a
final
paragraph."
and
he
did.
i
said,
"my
heart
pumps
me
to
add
two
further
flaws,"
and
they
both
stand
from
the
fear
that
i
have
not
appealed.
he's
only
speaking,
if
you
please,
that
i
have
not
appealed
through
your
honors'
discretion
despite
the
fact
that
i
have
offered
to
do
a
little
more
than
i
think
i
can.
the
first
thought
is
that
he
at
my
offer
of
25%
of
my
net
income
is
not
high
enough
in
the
court's
opinion
that
i
will
try
to
comply
with
what
the
court
suggests.
it
ought
to
be.
and
the
court
wouldn't
make
a
suggestion
except
yes.
the
judge
didn't
say
this
to
me.
he
said,
"from
my
experience,
i
know
this
kind
of
people.
they'll
pay
if
i
enter
the
order."
that
was
the
judge.
he
goes
on
here
to
say
in
this
affidavit,
the
second
thought
is
this,
"if
the
court
does
grant
the
motion
for
body
execution,
my
life
is
through.
i'll
have
to
leave
the
state
or
go
to
jail,"
and
he
does
leave
the
state.
i
challenged
all
the
statements
that
he
didn't
bare
his
status
because
i
was
there
with
him
in
questioning.
and
the
judge
put
the
same
questions.
the
judge
asked
about
fur
coat,
about
jewels.
the
judge
went
further
to
ask
some
questions.
i
didn't
--
what
about
his
sons?
don't
they
have
money?
are
there
any
relatives
or
families
that
have
money
and
still
in
spite
of
all
of
these,
the
judge
enters
this
body
execution
order
under
which
he
can
either
pay
or
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
there
isn't
any
alternative,
at
least
there
wasn't
in
the
way
in
which
this
judge
applied
764
and
that's
the
question
that
is
before
this
court.
it
was
either
you
pay
half
now,
you
flip
security
for
the
balance
or
you
go
to
jail
for
six
months.
and
that's
what
i'm
challenging.
