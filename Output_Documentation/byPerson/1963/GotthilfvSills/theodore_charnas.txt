mr.
theodore
charnas
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
very
--
the
remarked
made
by
my
adversary
to
the
effect
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
playing
games.
that
the
creditor
was
playing
games.
i
say
to
you
that
if
there
were
any
games
played
here,
they
were
played
deliberately
and
willfully
by
this
judgment
debtor
who
is
a
common
swindler,
now
residing
in
miami
sounding
himself
in
florida,
safe
from
body
arrest
and
who
have
the
temerity
in
an
action
which
we
instituted
on
this
judgment
in
florida
to
assert
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
there
was
pending
an
appeal
before
this
court.
this
appeal
number
50
which
he
says
in
his
answer
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment,
and
there
was
nothing
before
you
insofar
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned
seeking
a
review
of
the
judgment.
the
whole
point
of
my
adversary's
remark
has
been
that
the
section
764
is
unconstitutional.
the
order
for
arrest
should
be
vacated.
this
is
the
kind
of
a
swindler
that
we're
dealing
with.
this
man
got
here.
if
anybody
is
the
suppliant
before
this
court,
it
is
this
poor
creditor,
gotthilf
swindler
the
creditor
as
i
will
show
you
by
telling
you
the
facts.
and
it
is
the
creditor
who
had
to
retain
counsel
through
all
these
appeals,
print
records
without
any
possibility
of
getting
the
cost
back,
while
this
better
is
down
in
trial
that
are
defending
the
action
on
the
judgment.
now,
it's
very
--
all
very
well
to
dismiss
very
hourly
the
threshold
question
of
jurisdiction.
but
i
don't
believe
that
my
opponent
can
get
by
it.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
final
order.
this
is
an
order
which
is
an
organic
part
of
the
judgment.
it
has
to
deal
with
the
collection
of
the
judgment.
this
court
in
prior
decisions
has
talked
about
the
unitary
aspect
of
the
judgment
and
the
proceedings
taken
to
effect
collection
of
the
judgment.
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
isn't
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
the
--
of
course
sir,
of
course
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
way
in
which
one
can
be
relieved
of
this
body
execution
is
not
the
tool
alternatives
either
go
to
jail
or
pay,
there's
a
final
alternative.
tell
the
truth,
make
an
honest
disclosure.
since
1940
when
the
words
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
where
incited
to
the
civil
practice
act,
there
is
not
one
case
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
a
poor
debtor
who
made
bear
his
status
to
the
court
was
in
conservative.
mr.
theodore
charnas
the
--
the
--
about
the
discretion?
mr.
theodore
charnas
764
mr.
theodore
charnas
this
is
not
in
the
statute
judge
goldberg,
but
it
is
--
runs
right
through
the
case
law.
i
can
cite
case
after
case.
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
believe
--
i
believe
i
have
such
a
case
which
is
not
quoted
in
my
brief
but
which
is
referred
to
in
another
case
heard
by
this
court
and
which
again
was
not
cited
in
my
brief
because
all
this
was
really
taken
up
by
the
attorney
general
who
filed
his
brief
amicus
on
the
subject
of
--
of
jurisdiction.
and
i
wonder
if
i
might
refer
to
the
court
to
the
case
of
fox
against
capital
company,
299
u.s.
106,
an
opinion
by
justice
cardozo
where
the
question
of
finality
of
an
ordered
came
up,
in
--
in
proceeding
supplemental
to
execution.
a
debtor
was
arise
it,
and
proceedings
supplemental
to
execution
because
he
failed
to
make
an
honest
disclosure.
and
judge
cardozo
said,
"the
rule
is
settled
in
this
court
but
except
the
connection
with
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
or
decree,
a
party
to
a
suit
may
not
review
or
appeal
from
an
order
finding
over
imprisoning
him
for
the
commission
of
the
civil
content."
in
other
words,
that's
as
far
as
it
went.
now,
i'm
not
directly
answering
your
questions
and
i
realized
that,
but
there
isn't
stainer
case
mentioned
cited
in
these
fox
against
capital
case
to
which
i
like
--
would
like
to
refer
to
the
court.
mr.
theodore
charnas
(inaudible)
a
moment
and
find
it.
may
i
submit
it
in
writing
after
the
argument
mr.
chief
justice?
now,
i
say
it
is
clearly
not
a
final
order.
my
opponent
raises
his
hands
and
says,
"what
was
the
--
what
was
there
left
for
the
debtor?"
this
is
the
ultimate
thing,
the
threat
of
imprisonment.
there
was
no
threat
of
imprisonment
here
if
he
told
the
truth.
justice
gellinoff
said,
"make
bare
your
status.
if
you
make
bare
your
status,
tell
us
what
you've
got.
there
will
be
no
arrest
provided
you
make
a
reasonable
offer."
this,
the
debtor
refused
to
do.
now,
the
second
point
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
to
do
with
what
was
discussed
a
moment
ago
in
connection
with
exhausting
state
remedies.
now,
what
did
my
opponent
do?
he
didn't
like
the
appellate
division
of
the
first
department
of
the
state
of
new
york.
they
had
--
they
treated
him
summarily
and
while
justice
gellinoff
had
given
him
one
line,
they
didn't
give
him
any
lines.
they
had
--
they
denied
his
motion
to
vacate
--
his
appeal
from
the
order
of
the
lower
court,
denying
his
application
to
vacate
the
default.
so
he
bypassed
them.
he
bypassed
them
because
he
didn't
like
them
and
he
--
he
hedged
--
he
hedged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
filed
one
notice
of
appeal
as
of
the
right
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
asserting
a
constitutional
issue
and
at
the
same
time,
moved
for
a
leave
to
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
substantial
justice
here
called
for
an
appeal.
now,
he
had
the
right.
he
had
the
alternative
remedy
at
that
time.
he
had
the
opportunity
to
go
into
the
appellate
division
and
ask
for
certification
of
a
constitutional
question.
and
here
again
i
say
that
the
general
practice
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
that,
when
an
application
is
made
to
an
appellate
division
for
leave
to
appeal
on
a
certified
question,
it
is
the
general
practice
for
the
appellate
division
if
it
believes
that
the
question
has
any
substance
to
certify
the
question.
and
finally
i
would
say,
since
that
--
insofar
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
that
since
this
court
has
a
rule
that
only
final
orders
are
to
be
considered
by
this
court,
nothing,
no
reason,
no
valid
reason
is
given
for
departure,
nothing
at
all,
and
very
solemn
indeed
if
ever
has
this
court
given
--
taken
jurisdiction
where
a
--
where
a
petitioner
has
failed
to
exhaust
the
remedies
available
to
him
in
the
lower
court.
now,
this
means
this
avenue,
this
ability
to
go
to
the
appellate
division
and
a
certified
question
was
opened
to
him,
he
rejected
it.
now,
what
really
were
the
facts
here?
for
this
--
this
poor
debtor
that
my
opponent
has
been
talking
about,
sills
of
cambridge
is
a
small
tailoring
company.
they
were
factored
by
charge-it
systems
inc.
mr.
gotthilf
was
chairman
of
the
board
and
run
charge-it
systems
inc.
sills
of
chamber
to
the
corporation
deposited
some
$28,000
worth
of
accounts
receivable
with
charged-it
systems
and
they
paid
well
for
the
advances
given
by
charge-it
systems
against
this
collateral.
there
came
a
time
when
there
was
a
dispute.
cambridge
--
sills
of
cambridge
inc.
said,
"you're
overcharging
us"
and
there
was
a
big
fight
and
charge-it
systems
raised
the
question
about
the
value
of
the
collateral
and
they
agreed
to
settle
it
on
this
basis.
the
two
sills
brothers
personally
who
have
not
previously
been
personally
obligated
agreed
to
pay
$13,000
to
charge-it
systems.
charge-it
systems
agreed
to
continue
to
collect
the
collateral
and
because
sills
of
cambridge
was
indebted
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
gotthilf,
that's
charge-it
systems,
agreed
to
remit
from
the
receipts
from
the
collateral
periodically
to
the
internal
revenue
service
so
that
sills
of
cambridge
could
be
credited
with
this
payment.
gotthilf
drew
the
agreement.
it
was
executed.
it's
a
--
it
was
next
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
the
sills
brothers
paid
promptly
and
over
a
period
of
10
months,
they've
paid
the
full
$13,000.
and
each
month,
they
received
their
copy
of
a
letter
signed
by
gotthilf
reporting
that
the
copy
of
a
letter
sent
to
the
internal
revenue
service
which
in
substance
ran
something
like
this,
"dear
mr.
sprinson,"
mr.
sprinson
being
the
man
in-charge
of
the
internal
revenue
service
pursuant
to
our
letter
of
so
and
so."
you
will
find
enclosed
here
with
our
check,
so
and
so
for
$400
ode
covering
the
payments
we
received
in
september
from
the
customer
showing
on
the
x
list."
we
got
a
thin
copy
of
such
a
letter.
and
in
our
na√Øve
pay,
we
assumed
that
the
check
had
gone
out,
that
the
original
had
gone
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
so
the
sills
brothers
paid
the
money
periodically.
and
then
lo
and
behold,
it
was
discovered
that
no
such
payments
were
ever
made
for
the
internal
revenue
service,
nothing
at
all.
so
gotthilf
got
his
$13,000,
kept
the
money
he
collected
from
the
collateral,
is
now
residing
himself
in
florida
and
my
opponent
says,
"look
what
we
are
doing
to
this
poor
exhausted
individual,
this
indigent
man
whom
we
are
playing
alive
apparently
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states."
but
we
started
an
action
and
that
we
alleged
this
in
the
action
and
we
got
a
verified
answer
and
gotthilf,
we
sued
gotthilf.
we
sued
gotthilf
because
there
was
separate
torts
committed
by
gotthilf
and
committed
by
the
corporation
that
he
was
chair
--
of
which
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
board.
and
gotthilf
didn't
deny
our
allegations
that
the
checks
and
letters
were
never
sent
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
not
at
all.
he
said
that
sills
of
cambridge
had
deceived
him
into
entering
into
the
agreement.
therefore,
he
had
kept
the
proceeds
of
the
--
of
the
collateral.
he
never
disavowed
the
contract.
he
continued
very
politely
to
pocket
the
$13,000,
but
this
he
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense.
a
motion
was
made
to
examine
him
before
trial.
he
default
it.
we
telephoned
mr.
palmer's
office,
he's
then
attorney
that
day.
mr.
palmer
said
he
had
abandoned
the
case.
now,
the
argument
was
raised
subsequently
by
mr.
palmer
that
an
agreement
has
been
made
between
mr.
palmer
and
myself,
that
i
would
abandon
the
action
as
against
mr.
gotthilf
personally.
i
sworn
then,
i
sworn
the
appellate
division
and
i
take
oath
before
you
gentlemen.
there
was
never
such
an
agreement.
it
would
have
been
preposterous.
why
should
i
have
tried
to
collect
from
a
corporation
which
by
that
time
i
knew
was
the
fund,
charge-it
systems
be
fund?
why
should
i
chase
charge-it
systems
and
not
gotthilf?
it
would
have
been
clearly
idiotic.
but
lower
court
believed
me,
the
appellate
division
and
i
asked
you.
in
any
event,
we
move
to
examine
before
trial,
he
defaulted.
we
then
move
to
strike
his
answer,
all
noticed,
he
defaulted.
we
have
served
it
with
the
order.
we
then
move
for
an
inquest.
and
an
inquest
is
the
taking
of
testimony
before
a
judge
with
the
presentation
of
proof
of
damage.
we
did
that.
we
brought
in
--
we
brought
in
the
president
of
our
cooperation
of
sales.
we
brought
in
mr.
sprinson
of
the
internal
revenue
service
who
testified
that
they've
never
gotten
the
money.
now,
strangely
enough,
mr.
palmer
was
given
--
who
had
been
given
notice
of
the
inquest
by
me
appeared
at
the
inquest
and
the
judge
presiding
turned
to
him
and
said,
"we
invite
you
to
participate.
we
invite
you
to
take
part
in
these
proceedings."
he
declined.
he
turned
and
walked
away
and
willfully
defaulted.
now,
it
may
be
argued
that
what
else
could
he
do?
well,
he
could
do
this
if
there
were
no
damages.
he
was
in
a
position
to
cross-examine
and
to
present
even
such
proof
as
he
care
to
present.
but
he
walked
away
from
the
inquest.
so
of
course
the
judgment
was
entered,
predicated
upon
fraud
and
when
the
appeal
was
taken
on
due
notice,
the
appellate
division
of
the
first
department
affirmed,
so
that
the
judgment
stood.
now,
the
question
arose.
how
do
you
get
this
judgment
to
like
it?
we,
then,
found
section
764
of
the
civil
practice
act
which
states
to
the
court
may,
in
its
discretion,
incarcerate
a
debtor
in
certain
types
of
actions.
one
of
those
actions
is
an
action
for
fraud.
this
was
clearly
an
action
for
fraud.
now,
we
didn't
go
out
and
arrest
this
man
and
take
him
off
the
street.
we
served
him
with
notice
and
we
went
before
a
supreme
court
judge.
one
would
think
that
a
debtor
in
this
position
would
say
to
a
court
that,
"this
is
what
i
have.
this
is
what
i
earn.
this
is
what
i
expect
to
pay.
this
is
how
i
expect
to
do
the
proper
thing,
the
right
thing.
this
is
how
i
want
to
win
the
approval
of
the
court."
all
he
did
in
his
affidavit
was
say
that
it
was
a
default
judgment
that
it
have
entered
against
him,
that
it
was
improper,
something
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
great
country
and
he
didn't
believe
that
this
should
be
done
to
him.
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
is
such
an
affidavit
in
the
record
sir.
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
believe
so
sir.
i
believe
so.
mr.
theodore
charnas
now,
this
is
in
the
--
in
the
record.
in
the
record
at
page
14
and
15
where
he
tells
a
story
and
incidentally
at
this
point
he
says
on
page
15
at
paragraph
18,
"i
am
present.
i
am
available
for
supplementary
proceedings."
but
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
received
from
his
counsel,
there
was
the
statement
that
at
that
time,
gotthilf
was
on
the
run.
he
says
at
another
point
in
this
affidavit.
he
would
be
available
for
examination
something
about
the
proceedings.
he
would
do
the
proper
thing
if
the
court
only
was
kind
to
him,
but
he's
flat.
in
any
event,
he
did
not
initially
present
an
affidavit
that
made
any
impression
on
the
court.
now,
the
judge
did
not
summarily
say
to
him
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes
sir.
pardon
sir?
mr.
theodore
charnas
we
do
too
sir.
mr.
theodore
charnas
he
wouldn't
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
on
the
--
our
case
law
judge,
no
judge
would
have
sent
him
to
jail.
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
in
that
statute,
but
there
is
a
section
of
a
debtor
and
creditor
law
to
which
i
advert
in
my
brief.
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
cited
sir
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
--
pardon?
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
not
quoted
but
it
is
cited.
the
debtor
and
creditor
law
which
says,
that
if
a
man
is
incarcerated,
a
non-petition
shows
that
he
has
no
asset.
he
must
be
released.
now,
i
say
that
an
examination
of
our
case
law
will
show
that
if
a
man
makes
the
statement
that
he
has
no
asset,
that
man
will
not
be
incarcerated.
this
is
our
practice
in
new
york.
mr.
theodore
charnas
a
notice
was
given
to
him
in
the
order
in
which
the
court
handed
down.
let
me
explain.
when
this
man,
gotthilf,
submitted
this
people
affidavit
in
our
position
to
the
motion
to
--
for
a
body
execution,
the
judge
didn't
say,
"send
him
to
jail."
the
judge
handed
down
a
decision,
an
opinion
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
--
page
44
or
45
--
45
and
the
judge
said,
"the
defendant
will
be
granted
an
opportunity
of
a
--"
forgive
me.
let
me
go
back
a
sentence.
all
that
he
appeals
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
45,
the
top
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
--
of
the
page.
the
second
line,
although
he
appeals
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
the
defendant
has
neglected
to
bear
completely
his
present
financial
status
and
future
prospects
and
to
present
any
plan
for
payment
of
the
judgment.
now,
the
court
said,
"the
defendant
will
be
granted
an
opportunity
to
do
so,
by
serving
and
filing
an
additional
affidavit."
this
certainly
was
no
summary
act
on
the
part
of
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
say
it
does
not
and
the
--
i
guess
this
is
a
crucial
question
in
this
appeal.
i
say
it
does
not,
first,
because
the
term
imprisonment
for
debt
would
seem
to
exclude
any
alternatives
except
the
payment
of
the
debt
or
imprisonment.
in
other
words,
either
you
pay
or
you
go
to
jail.
this
is
not
our
practice.
all
you
have
to
do
to
avoid
jail
is
to
make
an
honest
disclosure
that
you
have
no
assets.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
there
is
anything
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
if
you
have
means,
show
us
what
you've
got.
what
have
you
got?
now,
he
submitted
a
second
affidavit
at
this
point
and
he
showed
that
in
the
--
in
a
month
and
a
half
prior
to
this
session
of
--
with
the
judge,
he
had
earned
approximately
$1300.
well,
what
happened
--
$1300
or
$3000,
forgive
me,
i
maybe
and
i
believe
it
is
$3000,
$3100.
well,
what
did
they
do
with
the
$3100?
and
wouldn't
you
think
that
if
a
man
were
in
this
position
that
he
would
come
before
a
judge,
he
was
inclined
to
grant
him
all
of
the
consideration
possible
that
he
would
come
forth
and
say,
"i
will
pay
$500
on
account."
i
tell
you
that
as
a
--
as
the
chairman
of
the
association
of
--
of
national
accountants
which
as
he
--
what
he
described
his
self
at.
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes,
now,
just
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
his
supplemental
affidavit
about
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
about
the
$3100
certainly,
it's
here.
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes.
mr.
theodore
charnas
well,
this
is
what
he
was
doing.
he
did
not
disclose
what
he
has.
mr.
theodore
charnas
well,
he's
just
gotten
$3100.
if
--
if
we
were
to
accept
the
word,
just
the
bear
word
of
any
debtor
who
said,
"i
have
nothing,"
this
would
be
impossible.
he
didn't
disclose
how
he
live,
how
he
ate,
how
he
supported
his
wife,
how
much
rent
he
paid
and
then
he
proposed
to
enter
into
a
game
with
the
court.
mr.
theodore
charnas
well
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
you
are
entirely
correct
and
in
preparing
this
argument,
i
may
say
very
frankly
that
the
question
presented
itself
to
me,
how
does
this
kind
of
procedure
line
up
with
the
procedure
for
contempt?
i
tried
to
see
how
i
could
present
it
to
you
in
some
credible
fashion.
now,
take
a
man
who
owes
money
and
as
a
judgment
against
him
and
he's
examined
in
proceedings
supplementary
to
execution.
the
man
is
--
an
inquiry
has
had
and
assumed
that
the
man
refuses
to
make
a
disclosure.
the
attorney
for
the
creditor
takes
him
before
the
court.
the
court
says,
"tell
a
story.
the
fellow
is
not
candid."
the
court
says,
"i
will
send
you
to
jail."
now
mind
you,
this
is
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
arising
from
an
action
ex-contract
to
whether
there
isn't
the
slightest
question
of
any
wrong
doing
inso
--
or
any
malice
which
is
founded
in
the
judgment
per
se.
and
yet,
in
this
contempt,
no
one
would
question
the
authority.
at
least,
i
haven't
heard
anybody
lately
question
the
authority
of
the
court
to
send
this
disobedience,
this
obstructive
debtor.
mr.
theodore
charnas
in
his
own
hand.
so
does
this
one
under
the
case
law,
so
does
this
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes.
mr.
theodore
charnas
well,
i
--
i
believe
--
i
believe
judge
that
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
there
--
that
the
contempt
procedure
is
on
all
force
with
this.
i
realized
that
there
are
areas
of
difference
and
nevertheless,
i
feel
something
different.
why
should
a
debt
or
an
obligation
arising
out
of
a
fraud?
why
should
that
be
treated
with
any
less
respect
than
an
ordinary
debt
arising
from
a
contract
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
but
there
is
in
the
cases
insofar
as
our
interpretation
of
them
as
being
synonymous
with
the
cases
having
to
do
with
contempt.
mr.
theodore
charnas
that's
right,
proving
that
he
can't
pay
it.
all
he
has
to
do
is
say,
"i
can't
pay
and
i
haven't
got
it
and
i'll
show
you
why."
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes,
not
--
not
by
the
--
not
by
the
conclusory
statement
judge,
but
by
presenting
facts
to
show
why.
in
other
words,
if
i
were
to
examine
the
supplemental
proceedings
in
my
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
is
a
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
is
a
section
of
the
debtor
and
creditor
law.
i
think
at
section
122.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
to
which
i
refer
in
my
brief
where
that
is
the
fact,
namely,
that
upon
presentation
of
proof
by
a
person
incarcerated
that
he
has
no
asset
in
a
situation
like
this,
he
would
be
released.
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
is
a
--
that
question
points
up
this
problem.
but
their
only
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
contempt
is
that
in
the
contempt,
you
have
a
direct
order
by
a
court
directing
the
defendant
to
do
so
and
so
failing
which
contempt
issue
is
incarceration.
in
our
situation
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
the
burden
would
be
on
a
person
who
wanted
to
show
that
he
had
assets.
but
how
could
that
person
show
it
unless
he
examined
it.
mr.
theodore
charnas
there
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
it
is
--
it
is
significant.
the
very
fact
that
you
asked
the
question
makes
it
significant.
the
--
the
point
--
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
that
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
direct
order
here
by
the
judge
who
said,
"make
a
disclosure."
but
the
judge
didn't
need
that
sanction.
in
the
contempt,
the
court
had
the
inherent
power
to
send
this
man
to
jail.
mr.
theodore
charnas
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
court
order.
mr.
theodore
charnas
if
the
court
should
give
an
order
where
there
are
contempts.
mr.
theodore
charnas
in
this
case,
there
is
no
order
and
it
isn't
necessary
because
the
legislature
gave
the
court
a
power
through
section
764
to
send
him
to
jail
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
--
if
--
if
the
court
--
at
the
court's
discretion
and
the
issue
arises
around
when
is
the
--
as
when
is
the
discretion
exercised.
now,
up
until
1936
or
1940,
the
words
subject
to
the
court's
discretion
were
not
found
in
the
law.
early
--
early
in
the
century,
courts
interpreted
this
language
that
you
may
put
a
debtor
in
jail
under
these
circumstances
to
mean
that
there
was
no
discretion.
this
was
automatic.
in
1905,
for
example,
there
is
such
a
case
cited
by
my
opponent
in
1905
with
any
cites
of
--
with
great
(inaudible)
over
the
situation.
but
the
fact
is
that
in
1940
that
--
even
before
1940,
the
case
law
that
developed
indicated
that
where
the
court
found
that
the
debtor
was
being
honest
with
the
court,
the
court
would
exercise
its
discretion
in
not
sending
him
to
jail.
and
in
1940,
the
words
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
were
incorporated
within
the
statute
and
they
have
been
consistently
so
interpreted
by
the
cases.
mr.
theodore
charnas
certainly
does
because
that's
not
imprisonment
for
debt.
imprisonment
for
debt
is
you
either
pay
or
go
to
jail.
in
this
situation,
tell
the
truth
to
the
judge
--
mr.
theodore
charnas
--
the
judge
wouldn't
send
you
to
jail.
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
say
there
is
no
case
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
is
the
established
case
law
that
no
debtor
who
tells
the
court
the
truth
with
relation
to
his
circumstances
has
been
incarcerated.
i
don't
mean
to
presume,
there's
a
red
light
here.
mr.
theodore
charnas
your
honor
has
phrased
that
far
better
than
i
could.
mr.
theodore
charnas
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
charnas
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
theodore
charnas
that
--
this
court
means
one
of
three
things,
pay,
make
an
honest
disclosure
or
go
to
jail.
your
honor
phrased
it.
mr.
theodore
charnas
he
has
three
alternatives,
not
two
but
three
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
not
an
imprisonment
for
debt.
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
do,
i
do
from
a
--
a
sincere
review
of
the
case.
mr.
theodore
charnas
yes,
sir.
i
might
say
that
they
are
closely
related
to
the
--
to
the
contempt
which
judge
goldberg
commented
on.
but
i've
tried
to
be
very
honest
with
the
court,
indicating
that
i
believe
there's
a
tremendous
area
of
--
of
similarity
recognizing
on
the
other
hand
that
they
have
debt.
mr.
theodore
charnas
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
theodore
charnas
oh,
i
don't
see
how
new
york
could
make
it
a
crime
under
the
circumstances.
the
only
sanction
--
this
is
a
sanction
to
compel
debtor
to
make
an
honest
disclosure.
it's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
says,
"it's
either
or,
either
jail
or
pay."
mr.
theodore
charnas
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
theodore
charnas
well,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
normal
way
of
handling
this
because
this
is
an
unusual
situation
where
the
--
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
where
you
bring
--
where
you
have
a
debtor
before
a
judge
and
the
judge
says,
"well,
disclose
what
you've
got,
and
on
the
basis
of
what
you
tell
me,"
the
judge
might
say,
"well,
if
you
don't
pay
$10
a
week,
i
would
consider
this
to
be
flouting
the
dignity
of
the
court.
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
jail."
now,
that
might
well
be,
sir.
that
might
very
well
be
the
situation
even
here,
but
this
is
the
most
unusual
situation,
this
man,
fleeing
the
state
before
that
making
no
disclosure
and
leaving
us
here
while
he's
in
florida.
thank
you
very
much.
