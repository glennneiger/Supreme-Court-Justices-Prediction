justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
under
your
state
law?
i've
just
read
this.
i've
had
a
hard
time
finding
what
just
your
law
is
on
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
come
in
and
said,
"i
have
no
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
get
any
money."
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
where
is
that
in
the
statute
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
is
that
in
any
indication?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
could
have
put
up
that
defense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
cited?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
quoted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
given
an
order,
directing
him
to
come
in
and
answer
that
way
before
this
arrest
order
was
made
a
notice
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
page
44?
justice
hugo
l.
black

justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
to
make
an
--
under
your
law,
now
what
i
am
trying
to
find
that,
does
your
law
provide
law
for
putting
a
man
in
prison
for
failing
to
pay
his
debts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me
but
our
judge
here
that
you
have
a
rule
and
practice
as
a
mean
of
excise
in
this
case,
say
to
a
man,
"well
now,
before
we
decide
whether
we
put
him
in
jail
or
not,
we
will
give
you
a
chance
to
agree
to
pay
this
in
the
future."
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
do
have
here,
do
you
not?
whatever
you
call
it,
i'm
not
sure.
an
order
what
you
call
a
body
execution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
the
corrective
judgment,
isn't
it?
it's
not
for
the
--
because
he
failed
to
testify,
is
it?
is
there
any
statement
in
the
record
in
the
order
that
shows
he
is
ordered
to
go
to
jail
because
he
failed
to
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
directed
him
to
pay
money
in
your
state
with
the
burden
and
--
would
the
burden
be
on
him
to
show
that
he
didn't
have
money,
a
burden
on
the
state
to
show
he
did
have
money
before
they
put
him
in
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
your
order,
however,
i
didn't
see
anything
under
--
because
the
order
is
based
on
the
failure
to
give
everything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
not
materially
your
point
that
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
order
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
failing
to
pay
a
debt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
that
--
suppose
--
suppose
it'd
be
true
that
the
law
is
now,
if
the
judge
is
restricted
by
five
or
what
restriction
is,
by
putting
a
man
in
jail
for
debt
to
his
discretion,
how
would
that
enable
you
to
escape
the
constitutional
question
you
have
presented,
wholly
it
is
limited
to
discretion?
is
that
what
you're
saying
your
statute
is
that
it
authorizes
the
judge
to
use,
say,
a
body
execution,
which
i
understand
is
put
him
to
jail
because
of
the
judgment?
is
the
fact
that
the
judge
cannot
only
does
that
in
his
discretion,
does
that
save
the
statute
from
challenge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
you
get
to
the
fact
that
that's
not
the
order.
now,
of
course,
if
these
were
recognized
and
had
been
labeled
for
before
a
crime,
undoubtedly,
you're
going
to
have
a
precise
statute
before
you
put
a
man
behind
the
bar.
here,
you
--
you
say
that
by
looking
through
the
petitioner
which
inclined
that
--
maybe
the
judge
wouldn't
have
done
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
suppose
you
would
agree
with
(inaudible)
new
york
had
(inaudible)
committed
a
crime
to
engage
in
this
alleged
fraud
that
these
provisions
for
which
you've
referred
will
be
too
indefinite
to
justify
conviction
on,
wouldn't
you?
