to

if

justice

and
under

than
it
did

i
thought
under

it
was
written

trying

competitive

they

yes,

has

has

it's
what?

but
has
there
been
any
law
since
then
that's
forbidden
government
agencies
to
get
all
they
could
from
these
companies?
justice
hugo

black
and
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
claim
here
is
that
the
government
maritime
commission
is
without
authority
under
the
law.

what

1955

your

first
complained,

it?
justice

(inaudible)
you
protested.
that's
right.
justice

but,
as
i
gather
from
this

i
don't
know
if
this

don't

you

the
matter
was
taken
up
and
you
had
read
it

sign

your
company
and
redesigned
it.
according
to
this
statement,
maritime
was
never
advised
on
february
15th,
1955
that
eastern
gas
in
any
way
objected
to
the
sliding
scales.
is
that
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
--
in
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
says
at
the
inference,
you
that
did
protest
for
one
thing
and
then,
maritime
commission
insisted
that
they
were
not
going
to
make
it
any
less.
that
you
agreed
and
suggested
that
although
the
sliding
scale
was
objected
to,
the
boats
traveling
on
the
route,
they
themselves
proposed
a
modified
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter,
a
half
or
50%.
justice

this
court
--
justice
hugo

--
hadn't
said,
in
any
event,
if
such
attempt
failed,
eastern
gas
unqualifiedly
accepted
the
sliding
scale,
gave
bond
to
perform
and
operate
it
under
--
with
increased
allocation
of
vessels.
almost
a
year,
waited
over
eight
years
before
contending
the
sliding
scale
was
invalid.
justice

is
that
right?
justice

where
is
that

where
is
that
qualification
in

(inaudible)
normal
profit
which
was

was
the
base
before
they
considered
other
profits'
excess?
justice

the
what?
justice

you
mean
10%
profit
on
the
capital.
justice

you

the

used

only.

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
investment
in
this
ship,
it
is
--
it
was
a
bareboat
charter?
justice

black
you
mean
the
capital
used
in
transporting
the
ship,
moving
the
ship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
wouldn't
enter
into
this,
i
guess,
because
this
is
for
the
division
of
the
excess
profits.
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

black
do
you
rely
on
the
1936
act
or
the
1947?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1946
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
mean
that
you
are
saying
that
the
agency
was
without
authority
under
the
1936
act
to
make
a
contract
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice

but
certainly
not
exclusion
of
the
power
to
sell
them
probably
too
cheap
or
to
make
subsidies
too
big.
