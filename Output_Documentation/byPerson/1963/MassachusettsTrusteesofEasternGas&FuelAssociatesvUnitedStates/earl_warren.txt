mr.

chief

(inaudible)
provide
for
that
accelerated
rate
than
the
original
contract?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
may
i
ask
you,
was
the
act
of
1946
specifically
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
raising
this
50%
rate
for
the
--
for
the
excess
profits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
the
1900
and
1936
act,
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
50%
was
the
most
that
the
government
could
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
1936
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
--
but
i
was
wondering
about,
they
had
a
--
they
had
a
contract
here
for
the
chartering
of
the
--
of
the
ship.
what
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
passing
this
law
so
far
as
existing
contracts
was
concerned?
what
if
for
the
purpose
of
accelerating
the
--
the
part
with
the
government
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
--
on
these
excess
profits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
it
from
the
beginning,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
it
that
--
that
congress
did
that
called
for
that
change?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you
were
basing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
upon
the
intention
of
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
(inaudible)
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
--
in
what
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
first
initial
victory?
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1957?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
barnett
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this.
i
guess
i
thought
section
709
(a)
of
the
1936
act
was
incorporated
into
the
1946
act.
am
i
correct
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
that
that
--
that
said
every
charter
made
by
the
commission
shall
provide
that
whenever
at
the
end
of
any
calendar
year,
subject
to
the
execution
of
such
charter,
the
accum
--
the
cumulative
net
voyage
profits
after
payment
of
the
charter
hire
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
reserved
in
the
charter
and
payment
of
the
charter
is
fair
and
reasonable
overhead
expenses
applicable
to
operation
of
the
chartered
vessels,
shall
exceed
10%
per
annum
on
the
charterer's
capital
necessarily
employed
in
the
business
of
such
chartered
vessels,
the
charterer
shall
pay
over
to
the
commission
an
addition
--
as
additional
charter
hire
one-half
of
such
cumulative
net
voyage
profits
in
excess
of
10%
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
per
annum.
now,
it
doesn't
say
it
must
pay
at
least
50%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
it
must
pay
one-half.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one-half,
now,
that's
--
that
was
specifically
brought
into
the
1946
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
do
you
read
that
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
but
what
then
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
profit-sharing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
it
say,
“and
more”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
you
must
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
doesn't.
it
says
“must
pay
half.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
“half”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
different
from
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
must
pay
half
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
excess
profit
over
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
10%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
doesn't
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
this
doesn't
say
“half
or
more.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
it
must
pay
half
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
excess
profit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
said
(inaudible)
mr.
barnett
is,
discretion
of
the
--
the
commission
to
be
used
in
the
--
the
basic
charge
of
the
charter
not
less
than
10%.
but
when
you
get
to
the
excess
profits,
it
says
that
they
shall
pay
half
of
all
the
excess
profits
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
isn't
--
isn't
one
--
one
place
where
they
have
discretion
and
where
the
other
doesn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
do
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
find
that
in
there?
i
--
i
don't
find
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
charter
in
this
case
terminated
in
1947,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
1947.
now,
was
there
an
accounting
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
an
adjustment
before
this
suit
was
brought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
--
there
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
know
how
long
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was
completed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
matter
over
the
years
or?
chief
justice
earl
warren
through
1951?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
it
was
two
years
after
that
that
this
suit
was
brought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
actually
paid
off
under
the
charter
and
according
to
its
terms
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then,
a
matter
of
years,
two
or
three
years
later
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
brought
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
brought
this
suit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
no
reservation
in
the
contract
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
what
claim
of
reservation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
that
on
the
argument
of
mr.
barnett
that
the
shipping
companies
entered
into
these
charters
in
1946
with
their
eyes
open
and
made
no
protest
against
this
excess
--
this
excess
profit-sharing
and
completed
the
--
the
charter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
received
their
money
for
it
and
then,
two
or
three
years
later,
filed
a
--
filed
a
suit
without
more
to
--
to
sustain
your
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
make
it
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
on
this
particular
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
typical
(voice

--
well

chief
justice

chief
justice
earl

is
to
the
same
effect,
isn't
it?
chief

the

effect.
chief

yes.
chief
