mr.
j.
franklin
fort
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
questions
arising
under
the
merchant
ship
sales
act
of
1946.
the
petitioner
here
chartered
10
ships
during
the
years
1946
and
1947
under
that
act,
and
the
argument
revolves
around
whether
a
statutory
provision
fixing
the
charter
hire
is
paramount
over
a
contractual
provision
which
we
claim
differs
from
the
statute.
the
statutes
that
are
involved,
your
honors,
are
set
forth
in
a
foldout
sheet
to
our
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief.
we
have
set
forth
there
that
the
relevant
statutes,
the
provisions
of
the
applicable
regulations,
the
first
form
of
charter
that
the
maritime
commission
used,
and
in
the
last
column,
the
form
of
charter
which
is
in
issue
here.
in
substance,
the
merchant
ship
sales
act
was
designed
to
dispose
either
by
sale
or
charter
of
the
large
fleet
of
war-built
merchant
vessels
resulting
from
world
war
ii.
the
statute
provided
for
the
fixing
of
a
basic
monthly
or
annual
charter
hire
and
for
a
--
the
sharing
of
profits
with
the
government
arising
out
of
the
operation
of
the
chartered
vessels.
the
first
section
in
concern
is
section
5
(b),
which
you
will
see
up
at
the
left-hand
corner
of
the
foldout
sheet,
which
says,
in
substance
that
the
charter
hire,
the
fixed
charter
hire
shall
be
in
an
amount
not
less
than
15%
of
the
statutory
sales
price
of
the
vessels
as
fixed
for
sale
under
the
1946
act.
the
second
section,
section
5
(c)
states
that
the
provisions
of
certain
sections
of
the
merchant
marine
act
1936,
including
section
709,
shall
be
applicable
to
charters
made
under
this
section
and
709,
which
is
the
principal
statutory
provision
in
question
here
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
that
column.
that
says
that
every
charter
made
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
title
shall
provide
whenever
at
the
end
of
any
calendar
year,
subsequent
to
the
execution
of
such
charter,
the
accumulative
net
voyage
profit
shall
exceed
10%,
and
i'm
giving
you
the
substance
now
on
the
ca
--
charter's
capital
necessarily
employed,
that
the
charter
shall
pay
over
to
the
commission
as
additional
charter
hire,
one-half
of
such
cumulative
net
voyage
profit.
in
the
next
column,
you
will
find
the
regulations,
the
regulation
relating
to
the
fixed
15%
hire,
reiterates
and
summarizes
the
statute,
the
regulation
relating
to
the
profit-sharing
hire,
the
50-50
division
of
profits
describes
this
as
a
mandatory
provision
in
the
charters
and
provides
for
one-half.
the
third
column
is
the
original
charter
which
the
maritime
commission
used
with
the
industry
which
provides
for
a
one-half
division
of
profits
with
the
government.
and
in
the
last
column,
you
will
find
the
provision
of
the
charter,
clause
13,
at
the
bottom,
of
which
we
complain.
in
substance,
what
happened
was
that
the
maritime
commission
took
section
709
(a)
and
rewrote
it
to
include
a
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter
hire
up
as
high
as
90%.
and
the
first
controversy
here
is
whether
they
had
the
legal
authority
to
charge
the
excess
amounts.
now,
the
ship
sales
act
form
of
charter
was
adopted
in
september
1946.
the
maritime
commission
fixed
the
basic
annual
hire,
and
i'm
using
liberty
vessels
now
for
purposes
of
illustration
because
they
were
the
type
of
this
company
charter,
fixed
a
basic
hire
of
$96,000
a
year
for
those
ships
payable,
irrespective
of
profits
and
losses.
that
was
about
$14,000
more
than
the
minimum
that
they
could
have
fixed
per
annum
under
that
section.
they
then
proposed
this
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter
hire
for
the
charterers
and
the
industry
associations
objected
to
it
and
after
these
objections
were
raised,
the
provisions
of
the
charter
were
amended.
a
further
provision
was
added
to
clause
13
which
is
not
on
the
foldout
sheet
but
which
is
at
page
7
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote
stating
that
any
payments
of
additional
charter
hire
based
on
profits
which
were
made
under
that
clause
would
be
tentative
and
preliminary
until
the
final
audit
of
the
charterer's
accountings
for
profits
and
losses
and
that
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
final
audit,
an
adjustment
would
be
made
and
amounts
refunded
to
the
charterers
as
may
be
required.
now,
that
clause
has
been
the
subject
of
some
litigation.
we've
cited
the
cases
in
our
brief.
it's
been
admitted
that
it
was
put
in
there
to
protect
our
position
with
respect
to
our
dispute
as
to
whether
the
charter
provision
calling
for
this
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter
hire
conflicted
with
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
and
i
won't
go
into
the
details
of
--
of
that.
i
think
the
record
is
clear.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
found
that
we
have
reserved
our
rights
and
that
we
have
relied
on
--
on
those
rights
in
--
in
holding
--
holding
back
and
raising
the
issue
at
a
later
time.
and
there
are
a
series
of
regulations
and
i
will
quote
you
--
we
quote
one
on
this
foldout
sheet,
toward
the
bottom
of
the
second
column.
it
says,
“referring
to
this
additional
charter
hire,
such
payment
shall
be
deemed
to
be
preliminary
and
subject
to
adjustment
that
come
--
upon
the
completion
of
audit
by
the
commission
covering
the
period
involved.
and
neither
the
tender
thereof
by
the
charterer
nor
its
acceptance
by
the
commission
shall
prejudice
the
rights
of
either
under
the
applicable
bareboat
charter
agreement
or
otherwise."
now
of
course,
the
petitioners
signed
the
form
of
charter
subject
to
the
reservation.
and
after
their
accountings
were
in,
there
were
some
minor
matters
to
be
settled.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
several
disputes
were
settled
within
the
framework
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
charter.
the
remaining
dispute
was
this
question
involving
the
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter
hire
and
one
other
question
which
i'll
come
to
later.
we
have
litigated
this
question
in
numerous
courts.
there
are
nine
decisions
squarely
in
point.
they
range
from
a
decision
which
says
that
we
are
absolutely
right
and
there
shouldn't
be
any
doubt
about
it
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
indicated
that
they
thought
the
decision
in
our
favor
had
been
lost
in
a
forest
of
pedagogy
and
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
in
a
forest
of
pedagogy.
the
decisions
--
the
divergence
in
the
reasoning
of
the
decisions
seems
to
be
this.
the
government
has
argued
that
section
709
(a)
which
provides
for
the
inclusion
of
this
50-50
profit-sharing
clause
really
fixes
a
minimum
that
it
is
drafted
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
and
that
any
amount
in
excess
of
50%
could
be
contracted
for
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
statute.
relying
upon
the
first
sentence
of
section
5
(b)
which
says
that
the
charter
hire
for
any
vessel
chartered
under
the
provisions
of
this
section
shall
be
fixed
by
the
commission
as
such
--
at
such
rate
as
the
commission
determines
to
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
this
act.
and
they
stopped
there.
but
our
argument
is
of
course
that
the
next
word
in
that
statute
is
“but”.
and
there
followed
numerous
restrictions
on
what
decisions
the
maritime
commission
can
make
in
respect
to
this
charter
hire.
the
first
one
is
that
the
rate
shall
not
be
less
than
15%
per
annum
unless
four
members
of
the
maritime
commission
decide
that
it
may
be.
the
second
restriction
is
the
restriction
imposed
by
section
709
(a)
which
says
that
every
charter
shall
contain
a
provision
providing
for
an
even
division
of
profits
with
the
government.
further,
and
we
argue
this
that
it's
quite
obvious
from
the
legislative
history
as
well
as
the
plain
language
of
section
5
(b)
itself,
that
they
were
not
talking
in
that
section
about
any
discretion
with
respect
to
the
fixing
of
profit-sharing.
they
talked
about
a
rate
of
charter
hire
fixed
in
advance,
payable
annually
based
upon
the
statutory
sales
price
of
the
vessels
being
sold.
and
that
in
our
view
does
not
authorize
any
profit-sharing
arrangement.
furthermore,
the
first
part
of
that
section,
which
speaks
of
charter
high
--
hire
being
fixed
by
the
commission
as
such
rate
as
the
commission
determines
to
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
this
act,
cannot
be
interpreted
to
permit
a
profit-sharing
arrangement
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
next
section
of
the
act
which
fixes
a
profit-sharing
arrangement
of
15%.
and
further,
the
legislative
history
indicates
--
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
(b),
which
we
quote
in
our
briefs
indicates
that
congress
was
consistently
thinking
of
a
--
of
a
fixed
charter
hire
based
on
a
percentage.
originally,
the
percentage
proposed
to
congress
was
8.5%
of
the
statutory
sales
price
which
was
a
figure
derived
from
the
1936
merchant
marine
act
and
it
kept
progressing.
the
next
draft
of
the
legislation
fixed
a
rate
of
12.5%
and
the
third
proposal
was
of
15%.
and
when
they
put
the
15%
in
there,
the
congress
considered
that
might
be
too
high
a
rate
and
they
therefore
added
the
sentence
at
the
end
which
would
permit
the
15%
to
be
lowered.
now
the
--
the
government
as
well
as
the
court
below
took
the
position
that
the
provisions
of
709
(a)
should
be
construed
as
a
minimum
profit-sharing
arrangement
on
the
theory
that
it
was
the
purpose,
a
dominant
purpose
of
the
1946
ship
sales
act
to
sell
vessels
rather
than
to
charter
them.
but
obviously,
congress
intended
that
vessels
should
be
chartered
or
they
would
not
have
put
that
authority
in
the
statute.
and
it
is
clear
also
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
expected
the
chartering
program
to
aid
in
the
rehabilitation
of
the
post-war
merchant
marine
as
well
as
the
sales
provisions.
there
were
a
number
of
companies
who
--
none
of
the
companies
had
ships
available
right
after
the
war
and
the
chartering
would
fill-in
their
needs
for
vessels
while
they
were
either
reconverting
vessels
which
had
been
converted
to
military
use
or
while
they
were
constructing
new
vessels.
in
the
--
as
i
indicated
before,
section
709
(a)
comes
out
of
the
1936
merchant
marine
act.
in
the
case
of
that
act,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
profit-sharing
arrangement
is
a
50-50
minimum
and
maximum
arrangement.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
on
that
and
we
of
course
argue
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
the
interpretation
of
the
section
in
the
1946
act
and
there
is
the
interpretation
of
the
section
in
the
1936
act.
i
might
say,
your
honors,
under
this
bareboat
form
of
charter
which
the
maritime
commission
promulgated,
that
all
the
risk
of
laws
was
on
the
charterers.
the
ship
was
turned
over
to
them
in
a
bareboat
state.
they
were
to
man
the
ships,
to
supply
them,
to
insure
them,
to
keep
them
in
repair,
and
redeliver
them
to
the
government
at
the
end
of
the
charters.
if
they
lost
money,
the
loss
was
on
them,
but
in
the
meantime,
the
government
would
be
receiving
this
15%
basic
charter
hire.
the
second
question
which
we
have
for
--
before
your
honors
is
one
that
we
refer
to
as
the
split
accounting
in
1947.
in
the
middle
of
1947,
the
shipping
market
declined
quite
markedly.
the
maritime
commission
and
--
but
before
that,
during
the
year
1947,
there
had
been
substantial
profits.
the
maritime
commission
became
concerned
that
if
there
would
be
a
turn
in
the
market
and
they
left
the
ships
in
the
hands
of
the
companies,
that
the
high
profit-sharing
rates
of
90%
might
be
diluted
by
losses
which
occurred
later
in
1947.
so,
in
august
of
1947
they
sent
telegrams
to
all
of
the
charterers
and
said
that
they
were
terminating
the
charters
on
15
days
notice
but
that
the
charterers
might
continue
the
use
of
the
vessels
if
they
would
agree
that
the
profits
earlier
in
the
year
might
not
be
offset
against
any
losses
which
they
might
sustain
later
in
the
year.
now,
the
companies
of
course
had
developed
their
trade
routes
and
were
trying
to
get
back
in
the
business
and
this
abrupt
termination
would've
been
quite
serious
to
them
because
they
had
continuing
charters
which
they
had
signed
going
on
into
the
end
of
the
year
and
into
the
next
year.
so,
they
signed
an
addendum
to
the
contract
called
the
foreign
trade
addendum,
the
principal
provision
of
which
was
that
for
profit-sharing
purposes
the
year
1947
would
be
divided
into
two
parts
as
of
september
1,
1947
and
that
the
profits
before
that
date
would
be
accounted
for
separately
from
the
profits
or
losses
which
they
turned
out
to
be
after
that
date.
the
--
there
was
no
termination
of
the
charter.
the
ships
were
not
redelivered
to
the
maritime
commission.
the
--
they
simply
amended
this
term
and
one
or
two
other
terms
in
minor
respects
but
the
principal
term
which
--
to
which
we
have
--
to
the
--
the
companies
objected
was
this
divided
accounting
term.
now
the
--
the
effect
of
this
particular
requirement
on
this
petitioner
was
that,
after
the
charter
was
over,
under
the
regulations
of
the
maritime
commission,
it
had
suffered
an
overall
loss
of
$50,000
on
the
charter
and
the
government
took
some
$500,000
of
profits
for
the
period
prior
to
september
1,
plus,
$700,000
of
the
basic
charter
hire
which
was
paid
monthly
on
the
charter.
so
that
the
government
received
about
$1,200,000
from
the
charter
and
the
company
lost
$50,000.
the
court
below,
in
respect
to
this
issue
--
well,
to
get
back
to
--
to
the
complaint
we
have
here,
the
section
709
(a),
to
get
back
to
that
section,
says
that
every
charter
made
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
title
shall
provide
that
whenever
at
the
end
of
any
calendar
year
subsequent
to
the
execution
of
such
charter,
accumulative
net
voyage
profit
is
so
much,
then
the
profit
shall
be
shared
50-50.
our
contention
is
that
that
section
not
only
fixes
a
50-50
profit-sharing
division
with
the
companies
but
that
it
requires
that
accounting
be
made
on
a
calendar
year
basis
under
the
charter.
and
that
it
was
a
violation
of
this
section
as
well
to
require
the
companies
to
agree
on
some
other
accounting
basis
rather
than
the
calendar
year,
in
other
words,
to
split
the
year
in
two
parts.
the
court
below
and
the
government,
both
point
out
that
--
take
the
position
that
709
(a),
that's
mandatory,
as
we
say,
provision
of
the
statute
merely
fixed
minimum
terms.
and
that
any
terms,
although
in
conflict
with
this
section
which
were
more
beneficial
to
the
government
could
be
provided
for
by
contract.
we
say
the
law
is
otherwise
that
this
is
a
mandatory
section
and
they
could
not
change
our
basis
of
accounting
simply
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
get
more
additional
charter
hire
out
of
the
companies
than
the
statute
required.

have
the
regulations
of
the
maritime
commission
issued
pursuant
to
that
reservation
clause
which
state
that
our
rights
are
reserved
under
the
contract
or
otherwise.
and
that
reservation
applies
equally
to
this
problem,
as
well
as
to
the
problem
of
the
sliding
scale
of
additional
charter
hire.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statute
that
the
con
--
the
addendum
to
the
contract
was
inconsistent
with
the
statute
because
the
statute
requires
calendar
year
accounting
and
they
made
us
divide
the
accounting
into
two
parts
into
--
in
one
calendar
year.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
while
this
case
deals
with
charters
entered
into
under
the
ship
sales
act
of
1946,
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
may
have
an
impact
on
the
administration
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936
which
is
of
course
the
act
under
which
the
maritime
commission
subsidizes
the
shipping
industry
at
the
present
time.
there
are
other
sections
of
the
--
there
are
sections
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
such
as
section
606
(5),
which
is
on
page
52
of
our
brief
which
were
of
course
passed
at
the
same
time
that
section
709
was
passed,
where
there
is
a
provision
that
every
contract
entered
into
under
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936
shall
provide
for
a
50-50
division
of
profits
with
the
companies
arising
under
the
subsidy
agreements.
there
are
many
other
provisions
of
that
act
which
speak
in
mandatory
terms.
and
if
this
court
holds
that
some
general
grant
of
authority,
either
in
the
1936
act
or,
in
this
case,
in
the
1946
act,
permits
the
maritime
commission
to
modify
these
mandatory
provisions
on
the
theory
that
they
fix
minimum
requirements,
then
it
will
undermine
the
administration
of
the
1936
act
and
--
and
permit
in
effect,
the
government
agency
involved
here
to
--
to
rewrite
in
our
view
the
mandatory
provision
set
down
by
congress
after
considerable
debate
and
discussion.
going
through
one
other
point,
your
honors,
the
--
the
decisions
which
have
been
against
us
have
implied
that
the
companies
were
making
tremendous
profits
out
of
these
charters
if
they
could
use
them
in
the
world,
in
the
open
market
that
the
market
was
high
and
for
that
reason
they
seem
to
feel
if
there's
some
justification
for
--
in
our
view,
stretching
the
statute
to
permit
the
sliding
scale,
although
it
speaks
in
terms
of
50-50.
we
don't
agree
that
that
argument
is
material
but
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
it.
in
the
first
place,
after
world
war
ii,
the
united
states
really
had
a
monopoly
of
vessels
which
were
available
for
charter
or
sale.
there
were
some
4,000
vessels
that
were
built
during
the
war,
20
million
tons
of
shipping.
in
handling
the
chartering
program,
the
maritime
commission
was
careful
to
specify
in
the
charters
and
their
regulations
that
the
ships
could
only
be
used
on
certain
routes
that
they
could
charge
only
certain
rates
to
the
shippers
and
that
in
some
cases
the
sub-charters
were
negotiated
with
the
--
with
the
shippers
on
the
basis
of
cost.
in
this
way,
the
commission
itself
confined
the
profits
of
the
industry
and
you
will
find
that
not
all
of
the
companies
had
profits
in
excess
of
--
of
the
--
that
were
subject
to
recapturing
excess
of
the
50%
rate
and
a
great
many
of
them
had
no
claims.
it's
only
the
ones
that
have
come
to
court
that
involved
the
payment
of
this
additional
charter
hire
at
the
higher
rates
of
the
sliding
scale
rates.
so
that,
we
say
that
the
profits
--
the
maritime
commission
attempted
and
accomplished
a
squeezing
out
of
the
profit
element
in
these
charters
when
they
made
the
charters,
and
that
any
argument
that's
based
on
exorbitant
value
or
excessive
profits
is
not
material
in
this
case.
and
further,
one
last
point,
obviously
the
--
in
the
case
of
all
of
the
companies,
if
they
made
--
even
at
the
50%
rate,
made
profits,
their
share
of
the
profits
was
of
course
subject
to
income
tax
which
again
would
have
the
impact
of
--
of
leveling
off
the
profit
factor
in
these
charters.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
i
think
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
i
would
admit
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
section
5
(b)
in
itself
is
so
restricted
in
the
nature
of
the
rate
to
be
fixed
that
there
would
be
a
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
but
i
think
that
the
presence
of
709
(a)
in
the
act
makes
it
abundantly
clear
if
they
did
not
mean
that
profit-sharing
should
be
dealt
with
under
the
--
under
section
5
(b).
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
i
--
i
don't
think
it
does
read
in
conjunction
with
709
(a)
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
doubt
it
even
if
709
(a)
were
not
in
the
act.
but
i
--
we
would
have
a
different
case
then,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
it
depends
upon
whether
the
termination
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
there
--
well,
there
was
and
there
was
not
a
termination.
the
ships
were
not
redelivered
and
all
they
did
in
substance
was
change
this
one
provision.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes,
it's
all
--
it
all
depends
upon
what
the
court
--
how
the
court
views
the
--
the
documents
which
we
signed,
whether
they
regard
that
as
a
new
charter
or
simply
a
continuation
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
if
there
were
a
new
charter
of
a
new
vessel,
not
under
the
old
charter,
then
your
accounting
would
naturally
start
when
the
new
ship
was
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
if
--
if
the
old
charter
had
ended,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
--
in
on
that
point,
we
--
we
rely
upon
the
--
the
reason
given
by
the
maritime
commission
for
sending
out
this
notice
of
termination.
the
reason
was
that
they
wanted
to
segregate
the
earlier
profits.
that
was
the
reason
they
gave
for
terminating
the
charter.
it
was
not
that
they
wanted
the
ships
back
or
they
wanted
to
chart
them
to
someone
else
or
they
wanted
to
contract
the
fleet.
it
was
simply
because
they
were
afraid
that
the
profits
which
had
previously
accrued
to
them
at
the
higher
rates
might
be
dissipated.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
no.
no
one
would
want
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
that
wouldn't
be
a
most
uneconomical
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
i
think
it
--
it
all
revolves,
your
honor,
to
the
--
resolves
itself
into
the
question
of
--
of
why
they
did
this
and
whether
they
were
not
trying
to
circumvent
the
provisions
of
section
709
(a).
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
say
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
execution
or
amendment
of
a
contract
or
the
exaction
of
a
condition
is
to
circumvent
a
mandatory
provision
of
the
statute,
then
what
was
done
will
be
regarded
as
a
fiction,
and
we
contend
that
this
was
a
fiction,
a
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
--
fictional
termination.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
a
question
if
it
happened
on
december
31st.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
although
--
i
--
i
won't
--
i
won't
admit
that,
your
honor.
it
depends
upon
what
happened
after
december
31st.
if
it
happened
--
we
wouldn't
have
the
question
because
we
would
be
on
a
calendar
year
basis
there.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
no.
the
--
the
charter
--
if
--
if
the
same
thing
had
happened
here
on
december
31st,
i
think
we
would
have
the
same
question,
the
same
question
as
we
have
here.
because
what
they
then
would've
done
would
have
been
to
say
that
your
accounting
for
additional
charter
hire
terminates
on
december
31st
and
you
start
off
anew
on
january
1st.
and
there,
you
come
back
to
another
question
which
has
been
in
the
courts
under
these
charters
as
well,
as
to
the
meaning
of
cumulative
net
voyage
profits.
the
courts
have
held
--
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
accumulative
net
voyage
profits
mean
the
combining
of
profits
from
year
to
year
over
the
entire
period
of
the
charter.
and
if
the
maritime
commission
attempted
to
prevent
that
accumulation
from
year
to
year,
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
that
statute.
and
that
is
precisely
what
happened
and
the
commission
had
a
regulation
which
said
that
you
could
carry
forward
losses
from
one
calendar
year
to
offset
profits
in
the
next
calendar
year
but
that
you
could
not
carry
forward
profits
in
one
calendar
year
to
offset
losses
in
a
subsequent
calendar
year.
and
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
that
regulation
was
improper.
that
this
statute
means
that
you
take
the
charter
in
its
entirety
from
beginning
to
end
and
you
accumulate
the
results
of
voyages
in
every
given
year
and
that
you
also,
in
computing
the
profits,
offset
profits
and
losses
which
occur
from
year
to
year.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no,
they
never
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
they
never
said
that
but
i
think
if
you
will
read
the
--
the
underlying
memoranda
here
you
will
see
that
they
were
changing
709
(a)
and
i
can
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
the
courts
below,
in
effect
said
that
even
though
the
commission
had
relied
on
709
(a)
when
they
made
this
excess
charge
that
it
could
be
ratified
under
5
(b)
later.
that's
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
by
the
courts.
and
of
course
we
--
we
dispute
that
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
on
that
point.
we
say
that
it
can't
--
that
the
sliding
scale
can't
be
retroactively
validated
under
a
section
of
the
law
on
which
the
government
agency
never
relied
when
it
--
when
it
made
its
finding.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
may
it
--
may
it.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
your
honor,
this
--
this
form
of
charter
was
proposed
on
august
12,
1946
to
the
industry
with
the
sliding
scale.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
on
august
15,
1946,
three
days
later,
the
ship
operators
association
sent
a
--
wrote
to
the
maritime
commission
and
included
a
copy
of
a
resolution
which
they
had
adopted
at
their
meeting
that
reads
this
way.
result
that
it
is
the
consensus
of
opinion
of
the
members
of
this
association
that
the
recapture
of
profits
under
the
proposed
form
of
bareboat
charter
is
not
commensurate
with
the
risks
which
the
charterer
assumes
under
his
charter
party
and
the
association,
under
title
7,
section
709
of
the
merchant
marine
act
1936,
questions
the
legality
of
the
commission's
right
to
recapture
more
than
50%
of
the
net
voyage
profits
in
excess
of
10%
per
annum
and
in
behalf
of
its
members,
the
association
reserves
all
rights
under
such
section.
by
the
same
date,
the
american
merchant
marine
institute
which
represents
the
new
york
companies
and
the
west
coast
associations
protested
in
a
telegram
in
which
--
which
included
a
sentence
that
said
the
proposed
rate
of
additional
charter
hire
exceeds
the
rate
authorized
by
applicable
law.
now,
when
we
litigated
the
time
bar
issue
here,
it
was
brought
out
that
the
form
of
charter
was
changed.
the
war
shipping
administration
which
had
the
50%
provision
in
it
was
changed
to
add
this
preliminary
payment
language.
and,
the
government
has
admitted
many
times,
and
i'll
read
from
one
of
their
briefs
in
the
time
bar
litigation,
“because
of
the
disputes
as
to
possible
violation
of
the
statute,
maritime
changed
the
language
of
the
charter
to
make
it
even
clearer
that
suit
should
be
filed
at
once.”
now,
that
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
make
it
even
clearer
that
suit
should
be
filed
at
once.
in
other
words,
a
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes,
on
this
issue.
that
was
the
only
issue
that
was
in
dispute
at
the
time
the
charters
were
signed.
now,
in
1951,
which
is
approximately
the
time
this
company
submitted
its
final
accounting
which
you
asked
about
and
which
was
submitted
on
the
sliding
scale
theory.
the
maritime
commission
sent
a
circular
letter
to
all
of
the
charterers
insisting,
and
that's
at
the
foot
of
page
40
of
our
brief,
insisting
that
if
they
made
any
payments
of
additional
charter
hire
with
any
of
their
accountings
that
they
should
be
accompanied
by
a
statement
signed
by
an
authorized
official
of
their
company,
stating
in
part
that
the
acceptance
of
the
payment
shall
not
be
construed
as
an
approval
of
the
correctness
of
the
amount
thereof
nor
as
a
waiver
of
the
rights
or
remedies
of
either
party
under
the
terms
of
the
agreements
involved
or
otherwise.
and,
as
late
as
1955,
the
maritime
commission,
and
i
think
this
is
an
indication
of
what
they
thought
the
charter
meant,
the
maritime
commission
wrote
to
a
number
of
the
companies,
and
we
have
put
the
correspondence
in
the
record,
stating
that,
well,
i
refer
you,
for
example,
to
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
--
page
103
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
your
honor,
we
were
a
member
of
this
group
that
protested
in
1946,
at
the
time
the
charter
clause
was
put
in
there,
and
that's
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
we
--
we
objected
with
the
industry
protest
which
i've
just
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
in
the
beginning.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
we
--
we
did
not
object
or
protest
further
after
we
obtained
the
reservation
of
rights
in
the
charter
and
in
the
regulations
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
but
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
--
that's
not
correct
because
it
says
that
we
unqualifiedly
accepted
the
charter
but
we
accepted
it
with
the
qualification
that
if
this
provision
was
unlawful,
we
would
have
a
right
to
raise
the
issue
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
--
at
a
later
time.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
that's
in
--
that's
in
--
in
the
regulations
and
the
clause
--
in
clause
13,
which
is
on
page
7
of
our
brief
and
also
in
the
record,
which
stated
that
any
payments
we
made
of
additional
charter
hire
would
be
preliminary.
and,
this
issue,
your
honors,
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
washington
and
i
read
from
judge
beeks'
opinion
on
this
point.
he
says
that
“from
a
review
of
all
the
evidence,
i
am
convinced
that
the
revision”,
meaning
the
change
in
the
terms
of
the
charter,
“resulted
from
the
charterer's
protest
and
was
intended
to
postpone
the
approval
--
accrual
of
all
claims,
including
those
based
on
illegality.”
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
“regulations
issued
by
the
maritime
commission
with
respect
to
preliminary
determination
of
additional
charter
hire,
instructions
issued
by
maritime
covering
restrictive
legends
on
voucher
checks,
numerous
letters
from
maritime
to
(inaudible)
and
other
charterers
effective
--
to
the
effect
that
the
charterer's
claims
based
upon
illegality
were
anticipated
at
the
time
of
entering
into
the
charters
and
that
such
rights
are
reserved
in
the
charters.”
and,
we
--
this
point
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
argument
on
the
question
of
reservation,
on
the
question
of
whether
we
have
completed
our
charter
and
taken
the
benefits
of
it
and
are
now
renouncing
the
charter.
we're
not
doing
that.
we
are
insisting
on
per
--
being
permitted
to
litigate
this
issue
which
we
reserved
at
the
time
the
charters
were
signed,
so
that
there's
no
windfall.
there's
no
denial
of
the
terms
of
the
charters
were
abiding
by
the
charterers.
now,
your
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
about
a
letter
in
1955.
at
pages
103
and
104,
there
is
a
letter
that
was
written
to
one
of
the
charterers.
and
on
page
--
this
is
written
by
the
maritime
commission,
and
on
page
104,
it
says,
“from
the
provisions
of
clause”
--
this
type
of
letter
was
written
when
the
maritime
commission
was
asking
the
companies
to
pay
charter
hire
and
they
were
refusing
to
pay
it,
and
this
company
did
refuse
to
pay
some
$63,000
of
charter
hire
because
of
this
dispute.
but
they
wrote
letters
to
the
companies
and
say,
“you've
agreed
in
the
charter
to
pay
this.
if
you
pay
us,
your
rights
are
reserved.”
and
this
is
such
a
letter
written
in
1955
which
is
after
litigation
was
commenced.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
same
effect,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
there's
four
or
five
of
them
in
here
that
we
have
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
--
included
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
now,
getting
back
to
the
1936
act
and
the
1946
act
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
i
--
i
don't
regard
that
as
--
as
unfair,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
once
it
--
one
is
that
we
did
protest
at
the
time
and
if
they
were
to
make
a
change,
they
should've
made
the
change
at
that
time.
now,
the
second
and
paramount
and
very
important
reason
which
goes
through
this
case
is
that
the
maritime
commission
did
consider
whether
they
wish
to
raise
this
as
15%
rate.
and
they
did
not
raise
it
because
the
vessels
were
operating
under
sub-charters
to
shippers
and
government
agencies
which
said
that
if
the
15%
rate
were
raised,
then
those
agencies
and
shippers
would
pay
a
higher
rate.
and
the
impact
of
all
of
that
would
have
fallen
on
the
government
of
the
addi
--
raise
in
15%.
and
the
only
way
that
they
could
get
a
hire
or
get
a
higher
contingent
hire
would
be
to
try
to
take
it
out
of
something
that
would
otherwise
stay
with
the
shipping
companies.
so
i
--
i
don't
feel
that
that
argument
has
any
substance
and
then
again,
as
i
said
before,
the
--
the
profit
was
squeezed
out
of
these
charters
in
--
in
our
view
by
the
regulations
and
requirements
of
the
maritime
commission
which
controlled
the
rates
and
where
the
ships
could
be
operated.
and
some
of
the
charters
or
sub-charters
were
negotiated
on
a
cost-plus
basis
which
of
course
took
the
profit
out
as
well.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
well,
the
--
there
wasn't
anything
considered
a
normal
profit,
your
honor.
the
statute
--
you
take
every
dollar
of
addition
--
of
profit.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
you
--
you
would
take
every
dollar
of
profit,
for
example,
that
a
company
made
and
out
of
that
dollar
would
come
10
cents
which
would
go
to
the
steam
ship
company
for
the
capital
which
it
employed
in
operating
the
ship,
and
these
ships
required
substantial
capital.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
on
their
capital,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
and
--
and
other
equipment
if
they
needed
to
use
that.
there
were
several
factors
that
entered
into
the
--
into
the
computation
of
what
the
capital
was.
you
would
need
working
capital
to
hire
the
crew,
load
cargo
and
things
of
that
nature
and
there
was
a
fixed
formula
for
that.
let
us
say,
$150,000
a
ship
per
year,
and
they
would
get
10%
on
that.
and
then,
the
profit-dollar
--
the
balance
of
the
profit-dollar
would
be
divided
either
50-50
or
$10
to
--
or
$90,
depending
upon
which
profit
bracket
they
were
in.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
these
ships
were
--
the
ones
involved
in
this
case
were
in
the
transatlantic
coal
trade.
now,
i
would
bring
out
also
that
there
was
not
a
consistent
practice
of
using
this
sliding
scale
because
in
the
coastwise
trade
they
had
the
50%
profit-sharing
arrangement
there.
and
on
a
number
of
passenger
ships,
they
used
the
50%
profit-sharing
arrangement.
and
that
this
sliding
scale
of
profit-sharing
was
used
only
with
respect
to
certain
dried
cargo
vessels.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no,
it
had
no
investment
in
the
--
in
the
--
it's
a
bareboat
charter,
that's
correct.
only
the
investment
in
the
working
capital
and
terminals
and
--
and
things
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
moving
the
ship,
hiring
the
crew,
outfitting
the
vessel,
paying
stevedores,
and
so
on,
normal
expenses
of
--
of
ship
operation.
and
of
course,
they
paid
the
government
the
15%
basic
charter
hire
for
the
ship
as
well
of
the
statutory
sales
price.
in
other
words,
they
paid
the
government
$96,000
a
year
to
use
these
ships,
pro
--
irrespective
of
profits
and
losses.
and
so
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
it's
a
division
of
the
profits,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
your
honor,
there
is
one
point
that
--
i
have
just
two
minutes.
under
the
1936
act,
and
i
think
that's
why
this
is
perhaps
a
more
important
case
than
just
applying
to
the
1946
act.
there
is
a
--
there
are
two
provisions
for
fixing
the
basic
charter
hire.
here,
it
was15%
but
under
the
1936
act,
there's
a
provision,
section
706,
which
permits
the
fixing
of
basic
charter
hire
on
competitive
bids
out
at
a
flat
rate
per
annum.
there
is
another
provision
that
says
that
they
may
build
ships
and
charter
them
to
the
industry
at
8.5%,
not
less
than
8.5%
of
the
cost
to
the
government
of
constructing
the
vessel
and
that's
a
provision
that's
very
parallel
to
section
5
(b).
and
if
the
court
holds
that
section
709
(a)
here
is
only
a
minimum,
then
it
can
be
held
to
be
a
minimum
for
purposes
of
the
1936
act
as
well,
and
that
goes
to
some
other
sections
of
the
1936
act
which
have
specific
provisions
in
them.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
i'm
--
we're
relying
on
the
1940
--
46
act.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
yes.
but
we
feel
that
there's
a
parallel
between
the
two
acts
and
that
any
construction
under
the
one
act
is
likely
to
carry
over
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
i
--
i
don't
think
they
could
make
a
contract
like
this
under
the
1936
act,
and
all
of
the
cases
seem
to
agree
with
us
on
that
point.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
because
this
is
a
minimum
and
a
maximum.
section
709
(a)
is
a
minimum
and
a
maximum
and
if
your
honor
will
read
the
legislative
history,
you
will
find
that
statements
that
say
that
under
the
1936
act,
that
50%
goes
to
the
steam
ship
company
and
50%
goes
to
the
government.
and
the
whole
evolution
of
the
1936
act
was
one
i'm
trying
to
lay
down
firm
standards
of
(inaudible)
--
to
lay
down
firm
standards,
guide
--
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
that
the
objective
was
to
lay
down
firm
standards
of
--
for
the
handling
of
shipping
the
government's
vessels
and
to
--
not
to
permit
the
government
agency
to
have
a
great
deal
of
discretion
because
of
what
had
happened
prior
to
the
1936
act.
mr.
j.
franklin
fort
no.
i
--
i
think
congress
--
that's
correct,
and
i
think
congress
wrote
those
safeguards
right
into
the
act.
and
that
they
did
not
intend
that
--
that
the
agency
could
make
a
different
deal
with
one
company
than
they
could
with
another
where
the
provision
of
the
act
was
specific
under
the
1936
act.
they
meant
that
provision
to
apply
specifically
and
it
was
a
minimum
and
a
maximum.
thank
you.
