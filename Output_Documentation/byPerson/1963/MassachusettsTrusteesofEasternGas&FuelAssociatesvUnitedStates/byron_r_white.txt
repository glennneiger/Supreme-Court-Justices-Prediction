(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
--
do
you
suggest
(inaudible)
profit-sharing
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
second
point
turns
on
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
termination
of
the
charter?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was,
are
your
--
are
you
--
do
you
lose
that
point
if
there
was
a
termination
of
the
charter?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
just
saying
they
were
terminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
a
termination
of
the
charter
and
a
new
charter
was
issued,
the
annual
accounting
feature
doesn't
--
wouldn't
worry
anybody,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
old
one
would
end
when
the
old
charter
ended.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
all
a
question
of
whether
what
happened
can
be
interpreted
as
a
termination.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
--
is
your
plans
--
did
the
charters
have
the
--
have
the
--
i
suppose
if
they
had
wanted
to
they
could've
returned
the
ships
and
then
taken
them
back
again
under
a
new
charter.
who
would've
wanted
to
have
done
that,
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
the
cha
--
if
the
--
your
client
said
they'd
wanted
to
keep
the
ships
and
accept
the
amended
terms,
they
weren't
very
interested
in
--
in
returning
the
ships.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
that
--
that
fact
doesn't
become
very
persuasive
if
they
weren't
turned
in,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
same
thing
had
happened
on
december
31st,
you
wouldn't
say
there
was
a
--
there
was
not
a
termination
or
there
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
wouldn't
have
raised
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
would
be
a
--
it
still
would
be
a
perfectly
sensible
question
to
ask
whether
the
charter
terminated
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
say
in
the
charter
or
elsewhere
that
that
clause
13
rested
upon
709?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
it
--
set
of
regula
--
in
a
circular
--
public
circular
or
something,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i'm
--
is
there
any
indication
that
the
commission
ever
relied
on
5
(b)
for
this
count?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
courts
below
rely
on
5
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
as
the
--
under
the
previous
--
pre-1946
situation
(inaudible)
there,
they
didn't
--
they
--
what
they
do?
bid
for
charters,
is
that
what
they
did?
how
did
they
set
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
bids?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
in
many
ways,
in
any
charter
that
was
issued
they
had
to
include
709
(a)
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
what
it
said?
709
(a)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
said
--
it's
been
in
there
since
1936,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
my
question
is,
not
yours,
my
question
is,
couldn't
they
--
whoever
was
issuing
charters
also
have,
under
709
(a),
if
you're
correct,
prior
to
1946,
put
in
a
sliding
scale
up
to
90%?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think
it
is
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
prior
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
1946?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
for
heaven's
sake?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
minimum?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
of
course.
now
--
now
think
about
it,
prior
to
1946
--
justice
byron
r.
white
before
there
was
a
5
(b),
and
--
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
commission
puts
in
a
sliding
scale
up
to
90%.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
says,
“i'm
doing
it
under
709.”
justice
byron
r.
white
because
what
all
that
does
is
provided
for
and
i
can
certainly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
go
beyond
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
need
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
decide
709,
all
you
say
is
that
this
is
a
limitation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
--
on
--
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
have
to
go
somewhere
else
(voice
overlap)
709.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
go
back
to
5
(b)
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
charter
never
did,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
--
did
--
never
--
never
referred
to
5
(b),
never
thought
it
was
actually
under
5
(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
commission
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
profit-sharing
concerned
here,
90%
is
basic
charter
hire
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
care?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
purports
to
say
though
that
the
90%
is
going
to
be
figured
after
the
basic
charter
hire
is
--
is
served.
i
don't
know
why
--
now,
you
say
--
i
think
you
have
to
care
what
the
commission
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
figuring
your
charter
hire
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
read
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
grant
of
authority
before
1946,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
except
for
the
purpose
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
requirement.
it
requires
you
to
exercise
this
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
could
challenge
the
authority
of
the
commission
if
it
put
it
--
put
that
provision
in
the
charter.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
was
left
out.
you
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
the
--
that
commission
had
never
writ
--
gone
and
entered
a
charter
without
these
provisions
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
only
for
a
year,
it
included
these
provisions.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
since
that
time,
they
have
been
issuing
charters
with
50%.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
clause
13?
justice
byron
r.
