mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
what
the
shipping
lines
are
seeking.
in
this
litigation,
the
related
litigation,
is
a
windfall.
it's
a
windfall
of
millions
of
dollars.
they
were
offered
charters
at
a
very
low
fixed
rate
on
condition
that
they
agreed
to
pay
to
the
government
a
high
percentage
of
any
excessive
profits,
specifically
50%
of
its
profits
in
excess
of
10%
return,
50%
of
the
first
$100
a
day
per
ship,
75%
of
the
next
$200
a
day
per
ship,
and
if
there
were
profits
in
excess,
even
of
$300
a
day,
90%
of
those
excessive
profits.
the
shipping
lines
were
not
entitled
to
be
given
charters
or
to
be
given
charters
on
more
favorable
terms,
and
they
were
in
no
way
required
to
accept
the
charters.
they
chose
to
do
so
presumably
because
they
though
the
terms
were
advantageous.
and
even
now,
they
do
not
claim
that
the
total
hire
paid
under
the
charters
was
greater
than
the
fair
value
of
the
ships
and
in
point
of
fact,
it
was
considerably
less
than
the
world
market
rate.
now
having
gotten
the
benefit
of
their
contracts,
they
asked
the
court
to
revise
the
bargain
to
give
them
even
more
favorable
terms.
they
do
that
on
the
ground
allegedly
that
a
part
of
the
consideration
provided
for
was
provided
for
in
a
form
forbidden
by
congress.
and
the
remedy
they
asked
is
that
the
court
excise
from
the
contract
that
additional
part
of
the
consideration
but
otherwise
to
enforce
the
contract
despite
the
failure
of
consideration,
according
to
its
terms.
now
specifically,
they
agreed
to
pay
a
fix
rate
equal
to
15%
of
the
statutory
sales
price,
plus
up
to
90%
of
excessive
profits.
what
they
asked
the
court
to
do
is
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
contract,
agreed
to
by
no
one,
at
a
rate
equal
to
the
same
low
fixed
rate
plus
only
50%
of
the
excessive
profits.
now,
the
result
obviously
have
no
relationship
to
the
contract
that
was
agreed
to.
but
more
than
that,
i
want
to
show
it
would
have
no
relationship
to
any
contract
that
the
commission
would
ever
have
agreed
to
had
it
been
told
in
1946
that
it
could
not
use
this
form
of
contracting.
now,
i
think
that's
self-evident
simply
in
the
relationship
of
the
low
fixed
hire
and
the
high
percentage
of
profit
recovery,
but
we
have
more
than
that
in
this
record.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
the
--
they
did
provide
it
in
the
original
contract
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
ship
sales
act
of
1946.
some
of
the
vessels
had
been
leased,
i
would
develop
this
history,
had
been
leased
under
--
actually,
be
--
when
the
ship
sales
act
was
passed
in
1946,
the
commission
established
a
policy
committee,
a
special
policy
committee,
charter
committee
to
advise
it
on
the
terms
on
which
it
should
charter
--
charter
vessels.
now
in
the
interim,
before
the
--
the
1946
act
was
implemented,
the
war
shipping
administration,
under
its
preexisting
emergency
war
time
powers,
had
chartered
vessels.
now,
the
war
shipping
administration
had
done
so
at
a
rate
equal
to
15%
of
the
statutory
sales
price,
basically
the
same
fixed
rate
that
these
contracts
provide
for,
plus
only
50%
of
the
excess
profits.
now,
the
policy
committee
that
was
appointed,
with
high-level
officials
of
the
maritime
commission,
immediately
and
unanimously
agreed
that
those
rates
were
entirely
too
low,
that
they
permitted
exorbitant
profits
and
if
they
were
continued,
it
would
undermine
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act,
namely
to
sell
ships
not
--
not
to
charter
ships.
the
purpose
was
to
get
the
government
out
of
the
shipping
business
and
to
sell
ships.
chartering
was
tolerated
only
as
a
necessary
interim
measure
to
satisfy
the
world's
needs
for
shipping.
there
were
not
sufficient
tonnage
available
and
until
the
privately
owned
fleet
was
reestablished,
it
was
necessary
to
allow
the
commission
to
charter
vessels
for
use
during
the
interim
period.
and,
the
commission
--
the
committee
unanimously
agreed
that
the
existing
rates
charged
by
the
war
shipping
administration
would
frustrate
that
policy
and
must
be
increased.
there
was
no
question
whether
they
should
be
increased.
the
only
question
was
how.
the
committee
thought
it
preferable
not
to
increase
the
fixed
charge
but
rather
to
increase
the
percentage
of
profits
to
be
recaptured.
it
argued
that
while
shipping
rates
generally
were
very
high,
there
were
some
trades
which
were
less
remunerative
and
--
and
in
those,
a
high
fixed
charge
could
not
be
paid.
and
it
was
impracticable
to
negotiate
different
terms
for
each
chartered,
depending
upon
the
trade
the
ship
was
going
to
be
used
in.
and
much
more
convenient
to
provide
the
increase
in
the
form
of
profit-sharing
which
would
provide
an
automatic
adjustment
of
the
total
hire
to
the
profitability
of
the
particular
trade.
in
addition
they
argued
that
a
decline
of
shipping
rates
could
be
anticipated
as
the
immediate
post-war
demand
slackened
and
as
other
capacity
became
available.
and
that
a
flexible
rate,
i.e.
the
greater
profit-sharing
rate,
would
provide
the
needed
flexibility
and
adoptability.
now
one
member
--
one
member
of
the
committee
disagreed
with
that
recommendation.
he
argued
that
the
terms
of
the
act
consistent
with
the
policy
of
discouraging
chartering
and
encouraging
purchase
required
that
they
set
a
fixed
rate
more
nearly
equal
to
the
world's
shipping
rate,
the
world
charter
rate
for
the
prevailing
market
rate.
and
he
urged
that
they
more
than
double
the
fixed
rate,
15%,
i
think
up
to
about
34%
which
was
still
below
--
at
least
below
the
world
rate,
at
least
as
he
computed
it.
now,
the
commission
itself
initially
--
initially
directed
the
--
after
the
--
there
were
actually
two
co
--
two
study
committees
and
after
the
first
one
reported,
the
commission
initially
directed
it
--
they
had
recommended
not
raising
the
fixed
rate
but
increasing
the
profit-sharing
rate.
and
the
commission
initially
rejected
that
proposal
and
told
them
to
go
back
and
come
forth
with
a
proposal
to
increase
the
fixed
rate.
actually,
they
reconstituted
the
--
the
advisory
committee.
but
the
new
committee
persisted
in
its
view
that
a
--
it's
a
much
preferable
way
to
increase
rates
to
increase
the
rate
of
profit-sharing.
and
ultimately
the
commission
agreed
with
the
advisory
committee
and
adopted
--
kept
the
rates,
the
fixed
rates
at
the
rate
charged
by
--
basically
the
same
rate
charged
by
the
war
shipping
administration
but
increased
the
rate
of
profit-sharing
and
finally
settled
on
the
sliding
scale
formula,
a
50%
at
the
first
$100,
75%
of
the
next
$200,
and
90%
of
any
excess
over
that.
now,
all
this
is
unique
--
uniquely
documented
in
this
record
which
contains
not
only
the
reports
of
the
two
committees
and
the
minutes
of
the
commission's
meetings,
but
a
very
long
detailed
affidavit
by
a
member
of
one
of
the
committees
on
the
evolution
of
the
chartering
policy.
now
here,
the
shipping
lines
asked
the
court
to
excise
from
the
contract
the
increase
in
the
profit-sharing
rate
but
otherwise,
to
enforce
the
contract
according
to
its
terms.
in
effect,
they
claimed
the
right
to
retain
the
use
--
the
benefit
of
the
use
of
the
ships
but
to
pay
for
them
only
15%
of
the
statutory
price
plus
only
50%
of
the
excessive
profits,
precisely
the
rates
that
the
commission
and
the
committee
were
in
unanimous
agreement
permitted
exorbitant
profits
and
would
wholly
undermine
the
purposes
of
the
act.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
my
argument
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
the
--
the
1946
act,
it's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
three
--
the
1936
act
made
mandatory
the
inclusion
of
a
clause
providing
for
payment
of
50%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
the
1946
act
adopted
that
provision
requiring
that
clause.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
i've
been
talking
about
is
the
administrative
practice.
the
war
shipping
administration
under
--
not
under
the
1936
act,
under
a
separate
authority,
a
war
time
authority,
had
chartered
ships
at
50%
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
with
the
profit-sharing.
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
the
--
the
1946
act
did
not
as
such
deal
with
the
contract
terms.
it
--
its
policy
was
however,
to
sell
ships
and
not
to
charter
them
and
they
required
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
the
40
--
of
the
1946
act,
that
is
correct.
but
from
the
beginning
in
the
implementation
of
the
1946
act,
we've
always
used
at
least
up
until
1957,
this
50%-75%-90%
scale.
that's
the
only
profit
--
the
only
profit-sharing
provision
that
has
been
used
under
the
1946
act.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
nothing,
nothing.
i
--
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
will
get
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
i
--
i've
just
been
dealing
with
the
--
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
judgment
in
deter
--
deciding
which
kinds
of
contracts
would
be
consistent
with
the
overall
policy
of
the
act.
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
question
of
specific
statutory
authority.
i
will
deal
with
the
effect
of
the
incorporation
of
section
709
and
show
that
that
does
not
limit
their
basic
authority,
contracting
authority.
but,
i've
just
been
showing
the
evolution
of
the
administrative
policy.
my
point
really
has
been
simply
that
never
would
the
commission
have
agreed
to
the
contract
that
the
shipping
lines
now
seek.
had
the
commission
been
told
in
1946
that
it
could
not
increase
the
profit-sharing
rate,
it
would
have
and
that's
demonstrable
from
the
record,
it
would
have
instead
increased
the
fixed
rate.
my
point
is
that
they
are
seeking
to
have
the
court
throw
out
the
increase
in
the
profit-sharing
rate
but
allow
them
to
keep
the
low
fixed
rate.
and
it
is
that,
i
say,
that
would
produce
solely
a
windfall
to
the
shipping
companies.
now,
they're
asserting
no
right
of
their
own
to
receive
a
contract
on
those
terms,
those
specific
terms.
they
say
simply
that
the
addition,
the
form
of
the
additional
consideration
is
unauthorized
and
to
prevent
frustrating
the
intent
of
congress,
the
commission
should
not
be
allowed
to
collect
it.
but
they
say,
they
should
be
able
to
keep
the
contract
and
all
--
all
the
benefits
of
the
contract
and
pay
only
the
reduced
rate.
the
fact
that
giving
them
the
ships
at
such
bargain
basement
terms
would
even
more
flagrantly
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
seems
to
be
irrelevant.
now
in
fact
--
of
course
that
would
not
be
the
result.
even
if
it
were
true
--
even
if
it
were
true
that
the
commission
did
not
have
the
authority
to
bargain
for
additional
profit-sharing
terms
the
result
would
be
that
the
whole
contract
would
fall.
the
low
fixed
rate
and
the
high
profit-sharing
rate
are
parts
of
a
single
system
of
compensation
and
if
one
falls,
the
other
falls,
wouldn't
--
then
the
whole
contract
must
fall
for
the
failure
of
the
bargain
for
consideration.
the
parties
would
then
be
remanded
to
the
law
of
restitution
to
adjust
their
rights
and
the
shipping
lines,
having
had
the
use
of
the
vessels,
would
be
obligated
to
pay
quantum
valebant,
the
fair
value
of
that
use.
and
as
it
so
happens
in
this
case,
the
fact
is
that
the
fair
value
of
that
use
exceeds
the
total
hire
payable
under
the
contract,
or
at
least
the
government
would
undertake
so
to
prove.
the
result
would
be
that
they
would
have
to
pay
us
more,
unless
the
contract
was
effective
at
least
to
limit
their
liability.
as
--
secondly
before
i
--
i
get
to
the
details
of
the
attack
on
statutory
authority,
there's
another
answer
and
that
is
having
accepted
the
contract
and
accepted
the
benefits
under
it,
the
shipping
lines
are
estopped
and
have
no
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
terms.
i
think
that
is
particularly
true
of
a
contract
which
was
made
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
charterers
but
for
the
convenience
of
the
government.
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
suggest
any
purpose
to
benefit
charterers.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
sell
ships
and
not
to
charter
them,
and
chartering
was
permitted
only
as
an
interim
measure
to
satisfy
the
need
for
ships
in
the
transitional
period.
the
purpose
was
to
foster
and
maintain
a
domestic
fleet.
it
is
true,
but
a
privately
owned
domestic
fleet
and
not
a
chartered
fleet.
now,
that
being
so,
the
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
chartering
was
simply
to
--
to
get
the
ships
afloat
to
serve
the
world's
needs,
not
to
benefit
the
charterers.
the
dealings
between
the
commission
and
the
shipping
lines
were
simply
an
arm's
length
business
transaction.
the
only
concern
of
the
commission
was
to
set
the
rates
low
enough
that
there
would
be
people
willing
to
take
the
ships.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
industry,
the
overall
industry
interest
was
to
get
the
ships
--
to
buy
the
ships.
the
industry
throughout
kept
--
as
the
business
declined,
kept
protesting
the
extent
of
chartering
that
the
commission
was
engaged
in.
and
the
--
and
the
congressional
committee
in
authorizing
a
further
extension
deplored
the
extent
of
chartering
and
insisted
that
the
commission
tightened
up
on
charter
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
well,
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
sure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
anybody
--
anybody
is
interested
to
get
the
best
terms
available,
but
you
can
find
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
act
or
in
the
history
to
suggest
a
purpose
to
confer
a
benefit
on
those
who
served
as
charterers.
they
were
concerned
--
congress
didn't
like
the
government
in
the
business.
they
wanted
them
to
sell
the
ships
and
nec
--
that
it
was
necessary
before
the
private
fleet
became
rehabilitated
to
have
something
to
carry
the
grain
and
coal.
and
the
heavy
demand
is
part
of
the
rehabilitation
program.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
--
we
are
told
repeatedly,
and
it's
been
repeated
in
all
the
courts,
that
the
industry
protested.
that
what
it
comes
down
to
when
you
try
to
find
out
how
they
protested
was
a
telegram
sent
by
an
industry
association
saying,
“we
think
the
rates
are
too
high
--
high
and
besides
we
question
illegality.”
now,
what
the
legal
effect
of
such
a
generalized
advocates
kind
of
urging
is
nil.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
no,
no.
i'm
not
--
i
--
i'm
not
as
sure
on
these
details
as
i
would
like
to
be.
i
think
there
was
no
protest
at
all
by
any
of
the
shipping
lines
doing
the
life
of
the
charters.
there
was
no
protest
at
the
time
of
signing
charters.
i
think
there
was
no
protest
at
the
time
of
the
annual
accountings.
the
controversy
came
up
after
all
the
charters
were
terminated
and
somebody
found
this
argument.
and
this
has
been
a
after-the-fact
argument
about
their
right
to
get
a
windfall,
get
back
some
of
the
money
they
bargained
to
pay,
and
that's
all
this
case
is
about.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
this
case,
i'm
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
told,
in
this
case,
1953.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
charter
terminated,
in
this
case,
1947.
it
was
six
years
after
the
charter
terminated
and
they
raised
the
question.
the
--
and
of
course,
since
the
initial
victory,
there's
been
a
plethora
of
litigation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
was
1957
also
--
that
was
1957,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
--
yes.
the
--
when
the
industry
got
the
idea
that
they
had
a
claim
and
started
to
per
--
process
it
generally,
i
don't
know.
here,
the
first
time
they
raised
it
was
in
1953.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
simplest
answer
to
this
case
is
not
estoppel
or
anything
else.
it's
the
grounds
that
judge
aldrich
decided
the
case
on.
and
that
is
that
even
passing
all
those
questions,
passing
any
deference
to
administrative
expertise,
there's
not
the
slightest
substance
to
the
challenge
to
the
commission's
authority
to
bargain
as
it
did.
the
act
--
the
basic
chartering
power
is
granted
by
section
5
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
act
which
are
at
the
government's
brief
at
page
46.
section
5
(a)
provides
that
the
commission
may
in
its
discretion
charter
vessels
if
in
its
opinion
the
chartering
would
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
now
the
policies
of
the
act
as
suggested
by
the
title,
ship
sales
act,
and
in
fact
the
declaration
of
policy
in
section
2
of
the
act
says
that
it
is
declared
to
be
the
policy
of
this
act
to
foster
the
development,
encouragement
--
encourage
the
maintenance
of
an
efficient
and
adequate
american-owned
merchant
marine,
as
it
further
defined
as
a
merchant
marine
owned
and
operated
under
the
united
states
flag
by
citizens
of
the
united
states.
the
committee
reports
likewise
emphasized
this
purpose
to
sell
ships.
the
objective
of
the
measure
is
of
course
to
transfer
the
government
owned
tonnage
to
private
ownership
and
later
in
as
much
as
the
policy
of
the
measure
is
to
put
as
many
war-built
vessels
as
possible
into
private
ownership.
the
commission
is
directed
not
to
approve
applications
to
charter
unless
chartering
is
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
it's
also
shown
by
the
act
in
the
statutory
requirement
that
the
commission
prefer
applications
to
buy
or
applications
to
charter
and
by
the
very
stringent
time
limitations
imposed
upon
the
commission's
chartering
authority.
this
chartering
authority
was
initially,
although
it
was
later
extended,
to
expire
on
december
31,
1947,
about
one
year-and-three-quarters
after
the
act.
this
is
strictly
an
interim
measure
to
utilize
the
ships
until
the
privately
owned
tonnage
had
been
sufficiently
augmented.
the
--
now,
as
to
the
terms
on
which
ships
will
be
--
were
to
be
chartered,
that
is
governed
by
--
initially
by
section
5
(b).
insofar
as
it's
relevant
here,
that
provides
that
the
charter
hire
for
any
vessel,
chartered
under
the
provisions
of
this
section,
shall
be
fixed
by
the
commission
at
such
rate
as
the
commission
determines
to
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
at
that
point,
just
up
to
that
point,
the
chartering
terms
were
left
entirely
to
the
commission
subject
only
to
the
guideline
that
it
was
to
encourage
ship
sales
and
not
to
encourage
chartering
as
such,
but
charter
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
take
up
the
slack
until
the
privately
owned
fleet
was
--
was
rehabilitated.
now,
if
that
provision
stood
alone,
if
that
were
all
there
was
in
the
act,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
the
commission,
if
it
thought
it
the
best
way
to
get
the
necessary
ships
into
operation
and
yet
prevent
excessive
profits,
could
have
charged
a
fixed
rate
plus
any
percentage
of
excessive
profits
it
deemed
appropriate
and
can
get
the
charterers
to
agree
to.
that
is
that
this
charter
would
be
wholly
authorized,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it,
if
this
is
all
the
act
contained.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
there
would
be
no
doubt
that
the
commission
was
authorized
to
make
charters
that
contained
no
profit-sharing
provision.
that
--
that's
another
implication
of
5
(a)
and
(b).
it
didn't
have
to
under
--
so
far
as
they're
concerned,
have
any
profit-sharing
provision.
so
the
question
is
--
the
only
question
is
the
effect
of
section
5
(c)
in
its
incorporation
by
reference
of
section
709
of
the
1936
act.
5
(c)
says
that
the
provisions
of,
among
others,
section
709
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936
shall
be
applicable
to
charters
made
under
this
section.
709
is
in
our
brief
at
page
48
and
49,
and
it
says
that
every
charter
made
by
the
commission
shall
provide
that
whenever
the
voyage
profits
exceed
10%
return
on
the
capital
necessarily
employed
the
charterer
shall
pay
over
to
the
commission
as
additional
charter
hire
one-half
of
such
cumulative
net
voyage
profits
in
excess
of
10%.
now,
we
agree
that
the
petitioner
is
quite
right
that
that
is
a
mandatory
provision,
and
he's
quite
right
that
there's
a
limitation
on
the
commission's
chartering
power.
as
i've
said,
so
far
as
5
(b)
was
concerned,
the
commission
didn't
have
to
include
any
profit-sharing
provision.
section
709
(a)
takes
away
that
freedom
and
provides
that
the
commission,
however
unwise
it
may
think
it
is,
however
much
the
industry
resist
it,
however
inconsistent
the
commission
may
think
it
is
with
the
statute
or
with
the
overall
policies,
the
commission
must
include
a
50%
profit-sharing
provision.
if
it
failed
to
do
so,
it
actually
would
be
unauthorized
and
the
government
could
collect
the
50%
anyway.
it
is
a
mandatory
provision.
now,
the
answer
however,
that
this
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
this
contract
did
include
a
provision
requiring
the
charterer
to
pay
to
the
united
states
50%
of
excessive
profits.
the
commission
went
beyond
what
congress
required
and
in
fact
required
the
charterers
to
pay
up
to
90%.
it
didn't
flout
the
will
of
congress,
it
want
congress
one
better.
congress
said
you
must
require
them
to
repay
50%.
we
require
them
to
pay
up
to
90%.
now,
the
argument
the
petitioners
make
cannot
simply
be
that
this
is
a
mandatory
provision.
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
the
argument
must
rather
be
one
about
the
collateral
implications
of
section
709.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
essentially
in
occupation
of
the
field
theory
that
congress
in
directing
that
they
must
include
a
50%
provision,
must
have
intended
to
forbid
the
commission
to
bargain
for
any
greater
percentage.
now,
the
--
the
argument
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
an
intelligible
one.
i
understand
the
argument,
but
i
don't
understand
what
possible
reason
there
is
for
attributing
to
congress
a
purpose
to
forbid
the
commission
to
bargain
for
better
terms
if
it
could
get
it.
the
--
now,
it
makes
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
of
course,
it
makes
perfect
sense.
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
congress
to
insist
on
a
50%
provision
and
not
leave
it
to
the
commission.
that
they
thereby
assure
that
the
commission
does
inadvertently
or
otherwise
set
too
low
rates,
at
least
50%
will
be
recaptured.
but
it
makes
no
sense
to
leave
the
commission
free
to
set
all
the
other
terms
of
the
contract,
the
fixed
rates
and
the
other
kind
of
rate,
but
single
out
profit-sharing
provisions
and
forbid
the
commission
to
bargain
for
better
terms
in
terms
of
profit-sharing.
the
--
that
is
--
the
pur
--
there
was
not
--
as
i
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
act
but
just
the
purpose
to
benefit
charterers.
why
would
congress
say
that
however
exorbitant
profits
may
be,
even
if
they
exceed
$300
a
day,
you
must
allow,
you
must
allow
the
shipping
lines
to
keep
half
of
it?
you
cannot
bargain
for
a
higher
percentage
of
the
profits.
now,
in
mandatory
direction
that
you
include
50%,
however
much
the
industry
may
resist
it,
to
require
that
you
have
a
50%
provision,
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
a
provision
that
you
may
not
bargain
for
more
than
that
would
serve
two
totally
separate
disparate,
and
i
think
inconsistent
purposes.
and
i
don't
see
how
a
direc
--
the
direction
to
include
the
one
contains
in
any
way
the
implication
that
you
may
not
add
on
the
other.
there
is
just
simply
no
inconsistency,
no
basis
for
contrary
implications.
now,
by
way
of
analogy,
mr.
fort
has
told
you
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
might
be
affected
by
his
line
of
argument.
i
would
like
to
point
some,
too.
another
provision
of
the
1936
act
that
was
incorporated
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
in
the
1946
act
provides,
"every
charter
shall
provide
a
mandatory
provision
that
the
charterer
shall
at
its
own
expense
keep
the
chartered
vessel
in
good
state
of
repair
and
in
efficient
operating
condition."
does
that
mean
the
commission
may
not
bargain
for
the
charterer
to
make
capital
improvements
rather
than
repairs?
the
answer
is,
of
course,
it
doesn't.
perhaps
more
germane,
it
also
provides,
"every
charter
shall
provide
a
mandatory
provision
that,
whenever
the
president
shall
proclaim
that
the
security
of
the
national
defense
makes
it
advisable,
the
commission
may
terminate
the
charter."
does
that
provision
occupy
the
field
of
termination
clauses?
would
it
make
--
would've
make
invalid
a
clause
authorizing
termination
by
either
party,
say,
on
15-day's
notice
at
any
time?
apparently
not
even
the
shipping
lines
are
willing
to
go
quite
that
far
for
these
charters
do
contain
a
15-day
termination
clause,
not
limited
to
the
president's
making
a
determination
about
national
defense,
they
can
just
terminate
any
time
on
15-day's
notice
and
the
validity
of
that
clause
would
be
germane
to
their
second
argument.
but
it
--
and
none
of
this
litigation
for
all
of
the
--
what
seem
to
be
extreme
arguments
that
could've
been
made,
no
one
has
ever
challenged
the
validity
of
the
15-day
termination
clause
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
requires
a
clause
saying
only
that
the
president
may
determine
the
interest
of
national
defense.
now,
the
point
is
the
statutory
requirement,
you
include
one
provision
for
the
benefit
of
the
government,
carries
with
it
no
implication
at
all
that
the
contracting
agency
may
not
bargain
for
better
terms.
it
only
requires
that
he
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
in
that
term.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
no
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
you
must
--
you
must
provide
--
you
must
provide
that
the
charterer
shall
pay
50%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
read
it
out.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
the
commission
--
if
the
commission
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
issued
a
charter
that
did
not
provide,
did
not
require
profit-sharing
at
all.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
the
commission
agreed
to
a
charter
that
did
not
require
profit-sharing
at
all,
that
would
be
unauthorized.
it
must
include
a
provision
requiring
the
charterer
to
pay
50%.
i
agree.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
and
it
must
include
that
provision.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
reading
it
out.
it
has
to.
if
it
didn't,
we
would
still
collect
--
i
say,
this
contract
does
provide
that.
it
provides
that
they
shall
pay
us
50%
and
more.
and,
i
say
that
it
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
“and
more.”
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
statute
says
you
must
provide
that
they
shall
pay
50%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
50%,
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
half.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
“shall
provide
that
they
must
pay
half.”
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
this
--
this
contract,
i
am
saying,
does
require
the
charterer
to
pay
half.
half
is
included
in
75%.
they
are
required
to
pay
half.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
are
required
to
pay
half
and
more.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
fully
satisfies
the
congressional
direction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
(inaudible)
not
in
the
--
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
okay,
let
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
okay.
let
--
let
me
frame
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
suppose
a
three
--
a
contract
containing
three
clauses.
the
first
clause,
the
first
clause
provides
a
fixed
rate
of
charter
hire.
the
second
clause
is
called
“contingent
basic
charter
hire”
and
provides
that
the
commission
--
that
the
charterer
must
pay
the
50%
of
all
excessive
profits
over
$100
and
80%
above
that.
but,
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
statute.
it
doesn't
require
all
the
excessive
profits.
it's
not
a
statutory
clause
at
all.
but
then,
the
third
clause
in
the
statute
--
in
the
contract
was
in
hike
thereabout
--
this
--
the
clause
required
by
section
709
requiring
that
after
payment
under
the
first
two
clauses
the
net
voyage
profit
left,
the
charterer
must
pay
50%
to
the
united
states.
it
would
be
a
clause
in
the
very
terms
of
--
of
the
contract.
it
would
be
preceded
by
another
payment
term
which
was
also
in
the
form
of
profit-sharing,
but
there's
nothing
here
to
forbid
other
terms
in
the
form
of
profit-sharing.
all
this
does
and
this
insist
that
there'd
be
a
50%
profit-sharing.
and
there's
just
no
reason
to
read
that
as
forbidding
the
commission
to
bargain
for
more
if
they
can
get
it.
there's
a
lot
of
reason
--
there's
lot
of
reason
not
to
require
the
commission
not
to
include
a
provision
for
more.
it
might
be
unacceptable
to
the
charterers.
but
there's
no
reason
to
forbid
it
to,
if
it
can
get
it.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
the
minimum.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
more
like
this
termination
clause.
it
--
it's
not
quite
a
minimum.
it's
simply
a
requirement
of
inclusion
of
this
and
not
a
prohibition
of
something
else.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
--
its
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
you've
got
to
include
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
alright.
it
operates
as
a
minimum
but
i
wouldn't
try
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
--
i
get
it,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
alright,
yes.
but
what
i'm
--
what
--
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
but
--
but
my
rationale
is
that
any
kind
of
statutory
requirement
that
you
include
one
particular
clause
or
another
for
the
benefit
of
the
government,
such
as
a
clause
allowing
the
president
to
terminate
the
contract
in
times
of
national
emergency,
carries
no
implication
that
you
can't
bargain
for
broader
powers
of
termination.
there
is
not
a
negative
implication
in
a
requirement
that
you
include
a
particular
clause
for
the
benefit
of
the
government.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
main
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
the
--
the
main
authority
was
--
there
was
a
special
authority.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
well
--
well,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
practice
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
--
yes.
they
had
to
include
that.
the
question
whether
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
so
far
as
709
is
concerned,
i
think
that
is
correct.
now,
whether
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
would
have
some
question
about
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
--
there's
an
issue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
they
have
to
include
that.
the
question
whether
they
could've
included
90%
clause.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
question
would
be
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
question
would
be
--
the
question
would
be
is
whether
the
direction
to
let
the
contracts
on
competitive
bidding
to
the
person
bidding
the
highest
price
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
the
inclusion
of
profit-sharing
terms
because
that
was
the
basic
authority.
they
didn't
have
this
general
grant
of
discretion.
the
commission
was
directed
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
-–
previously.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
you've
got
to
go
back
to
the
basic
chartering
authority.
there
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
this
act.
that
act,
it
was
a
--
a
direction
to
let
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'd
--
i
believe
that
the
commission
did
not,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
1936
act.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
this
case,
that
--
that's
the
ground
--
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that.
there'd
been
--
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
summarize
the
--
the
state
of
the
law.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
that
the
7
--
section
709
did
not.
there
would
be
a
question
--
you
have
got
to
go
back
to
their
basic
contracting
authority.
in
the
1936
act,
the
basic
contracting
authority
was
different.
they
were
directed
to
let
charters
by
competitive
bidding.
it
would
a
question
of
whether
a
direction
to
let
contracts
by
competitive
bidding
implies
that
it
should
always
be
a
bidding
on
a
fixed
price
and
not
authorizing
them
to
include
profit-sharing
type
terms
under
the
basic
authority.
now,
i
would
argue
--
i
would
argue
in
the
1936
act,
you
could
in
competitive
bidding
have
an
invitation
for
bids
provided
for
profit-sharing
in
addition
to
that
required
by
709.
i
would
argue
that.
i'm
--
i'm
prepared
for
purposes
of
this
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
to.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
it
--
it's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
there
might
be
more
question
under
the
old.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i'm
saying
there
might
be
more
questions
under
the
old.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
think
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1competitive
bidding
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
that's
right.
and
--
and
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
--
i
would
have
read
that
authority
as
permitting
them
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
no.
it
doesn't
apply
to
these
vessels.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
act,
i
think,
is
exclusive
as
applied
to
the
war
--
the
war-built
vessels.
i
don't
think
the
1936
act,
by
its
own
terms,
applies
to
this
fleet,
the
war-built
fleet.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
none
that
i
know
of,
and
that's
really
what
i'm
arguing.
that
--
we
--
we
--
which
is
entitled
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
think
you
--
you
should
ask
my
co-counsel.
i
see
--
i
see
nothing
in
this
statute
that
does
it.
now
the
--
there
had
been
five
decisions
holding
invalid,
or
at
least
tentatively
invalid,
the
additional
charter
hire
provision
four
by
district
courts
and
one
by
the
court
of
claims.
only
one
of
those,
only
one,
disagrees
with
anything
i've
said
thus
far,
that's
the
american
president
lines
case
and
it
rest
in
the
california
district
court.
it's
printed
in
the
petitioner's
appendix.
now,
they
have
said
that
709
carries
with
it
a
negative
implication.
i
at
least
understand
the
rationale
of
that,
though
much
as
i
disagree
that
any
such
implication
can
be
drawn.
the
others
are
on
much
more
obscure
grounds.
they
start
out
by
agreeing,
or
at
least
assuming,
for
purposes
of
argument,
that
the
commission
did
have
authority,
did
have
power,
to
do
what
it
did.
that
is,
specifically,
they
agree
in
the
three
clause
kind
of
contract
that
you
could
have
a
fixed
--
you'd
have
three-clauses,
one
is
fixed
hire.
the
second
is
contingent
basic
charter
hire
or
something.
it's
a
profit-sharing
clause
and
then
the
third,
which
is
in
statutory
form,
requiring
that
they
pay
50%
of
the
profits
remaining
after
they
pay
the
hire
under
the
first
two
clauses.
now
by
--
in
the
three
--
four
--
three
clause
contract,
you
can
achieve
exactly
the
same
results.
all
you
have
to
do
is
the
second
clause,
the
first
profit-sharing
clause.
you
leave
--
you
leave
the
charterer
twice
as
much
and
then
leave
it
to
the
third
clause
to
cut
him
down
by
half.
so,
you
can
do
almost
the
same
thing
in
as
many
clauses
as
you
want.
now
--
but,
i
take
it,
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
requires
the
commission
to
clutter
up
charters
which
are
already
complicated
enough
by
redundant
provisions
and
to
use
two
clauses
when
one
will
serve.
so
what
--
what
is
the
objection
that
those
courts
have
found
to
what
the
commission
did?
whether
it
is
put
by
petitioner
who
presumably
understands
it
better
than
i,
it
is
that,
while
the
commission
could've
done
what
it
did
under
section
5
(b),
it
didn't
act
under
section
5
(b)
but
acted
under
section
709.
all
i
can
say
is
i
don't
understand
what
he
means
when
he
says
the
commission
acted
under
section
709.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
--
i
don't
care
what
you
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it.
the
commission
has
broad
contracting
power.
it
can
contract
any
way
that
it
sees
fit
basically,
and
there's
basic
grant
of
power
to
contract.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
any
time
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
sure.
anytime
you
have
a
profit-sharing
provision,
then
you
of
course
have
to
say
that
the
profits
we're
talking
about
are
those
that
are
left
after
the
fixed
charges
come
out.
that's
all
it
says.
it's
the
--
the
profits
left
after
the
fixed
charges
come
out
shall
be
split
50-50
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
or
50
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
this
is
--
its
excess
profit-sharing
as
defined.
it's
excess
of
10%
of
the
capital
necessarily
employed
in
the
operation.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that's
the
argument
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
the
argument.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
but
--
but
709
never
was,
it
never
will
be,
a
source
of
authority
to
do
anything.
and
how
anybody
can
suppose
that
anyone
ever
thought
that
it
was
escapes
me.
5
(a)
and
(b)
create
the
basic
authority
to
charter
ships,
and
that's
the
only
authority
the
commission
has.
it's
the
only
authority
could've
exercised
and
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
that
it
thought
that
section
709
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
authorized
anything.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
709?
it
was
never
a
granted
authority.
in
1946
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
a
requirement.
it
was
a
limitation.
it
was
in
--
these
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
--
but
the
authority
that
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
basic
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
apart
from
709.
apart
from
709,
they
could
put
it
in
or
not.
709
says
they
must.
it's
a
limitation.
but
there
can
be
no
--
i
--
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
i
can
only
say
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
that
they
are
--
they
are
told
to
charter
ships
on
the
best
terms
they
can
get.
but
that's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
basic
grant
of
authority.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
charter
terms
on
such
terms
at
such
rate
as
they
determine
to
be
consisted
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
it
--
its
--
it's
a
broad
charter
to
the
commission
to
carry
out
the
policies
of
the
act
to
charter
ships.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
also
incorporated
into
the
1946
act
from
the
1936
act
is
a
provision
that
said,
the
commission
may
enter
into
such
contracts
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
its
--
as
--
as
may
in
its
discretion
be
necessary
to
carry
out
the
activities
authorized
in
the
same
manner
that
a
private
corporation
may
contract
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
conferred
by
the
charter.
they've
given
broad
--
initially
broad.
i'm
not
arguing
that
there
isn't
an
argument
that
709
doesn't
carve
down
their
authority,
but
the
initial
grant
of
authority
has
no
effective
limitation
other
than
the
15%
floor,
such
terms
as
they
determine
to
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
policies
of
the
act
are
to
sell
ships.
the
thing
that
congress
is
concerned
about
and
what
the
committee
report
showed,
that
provision
was
included,
was
to
tell
the
commission,
“don't
make
this
term
so
favorable
that
lines
would
rather
charter
than
buy.
make
them
stiff
terms,
just
enough
so
that
the
ships
will
be
available
in
the
post-war
emergency
period,
but
not
favorable
enough
to
encourage
people
to
charter.
we
want
them
to
buy
the
ships.
we
want
you
to
get
out
of
the
chartering
business.”
that's
all
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act
mean.
so
the
initial
grant
of
authority
is
virtually
unlimited
and
the
only
--
and
they
could
certainly
have
included
such
profit-sharing
provision
under
that
basic
grant
of
authority.
the
question
--
the
only
question
is
whether
the
incorporation
of
709
takes
away
their
authority
to
bargain
for
anything
more
than
50%.
that's
the
only
question,
and
my
argument
is
that
there's
no
implication
in
requiring
that
they
included
50%
clause
that
they
may
not
bargain
for
something
better
than
50%.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
--
i've
dealt
with
this
case
as
though
it
were
an
open
question
to
be
decided
de
novo
in
reading
the
statute.
well
the
fact
is,
the
maritime
commission
is
charged
to
carry
out
the
act
and
it
not
only
made
an
abstract
interpretation
of
this
clause,
it
chartered
thou
--
at
least
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
ships
under
charters
containing
this
clause.
now,
certainly,
whatever
is
left
of
the
doctrine
of
deference
to
administrative
agencies
requires
the
courts
not
lightly
upset
a
whole
pattern
of
con
--
a
whole
group
of
contracts
executed
over
many
years
on
the
basis
of
arguable
negative
implications
to
be
drawn
from
mandatory
provisions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
then
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
what
the
internal
arguments
were
about
in
1946,
which
to
do?
whether
to
raise
one
or
the
other?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
act
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
and
--
and
--
we
--
we
--
in
1947,
we
did
change
the
form
of
the
charter.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
now
we
do
use
higher
fixed
rates
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
and
50%
profit-sharing.
not
--
i
don't
think
it's
because
of
this
litigation.
it
may
have
been.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
actually
--
actually
there
was
litigation
prior
to
that
time.
they
may
have
just
wanted
to
avoid
the
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
that's
--
that's
quite
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
quite
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
since
the
current
charters,
since
1947,
i
believe,
have
included
only
50%
profit-sharing
provision,
i
don't
think
--
except
for
the
charters
prior
to
that
time,
i
don't
think
the
question
would
now
be
raised.
it
could
be
raised
if
the
commission
changes
the
charter
policy.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
under
outstanding
charter.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
it
went
back
to
it,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
from
--
from
1946
--
from
1946
up
through
i
think
1957.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
all
the
charters.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
for
10
years.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
from
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
from
1946
--1957,
1957.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right,
right.
but
i
think
with
proportionally
increased
fixed
charges.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
i
(inaudible)
--
the
condition
of
the
shipping
industry
has
changed
and
--
and
what
they
now
consider
to
be
a
proper
charge,
i'm
not
familiar
with.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
--
they
turned
the
ships
in
the
lighter
part
of
1947.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
do
you
know
when
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
accounting
--
i'm
told
that
the
accounting
went
on
through
1940
through
1951.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
correct.
the
--
there
has
been
a
lot
of
litigation
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
has
been
a
lot
of
litigation
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
not
before
this
court.
it
is
in
this
case
and
we
reserve
the
point
and
with
that
we
still
have
that
defense.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
at
that
time
of
the
final
payment,
it
made
no
protest.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
discuss
in
the
claim
that
there
was
a
reservation
clause
in
the
contract
very,
very
briefly.
i'm
told
that
the
government
has
admitted
that
this
clause
was
included
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
charterers,
and
the
government
admits
no
such
thing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
does
not
admit
that
and
in
fact
i
think
all
you
do
is
read
the
clause
to
see
that
it
is
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
subject
matter.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
the
second
part
of
clause
13
which
is
at
page
1
--
it's
set
forth
in
full
at
page
182
of
the
record,
182
and
183.
you
will
see
that
the
first
clause
provides
accounting
annually
and
requires
them
to
pay
within
30
days
end
of
the
year.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
19
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1950
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1957.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1956?
i'm
told
1956.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
are
five,
other
than
this
one.
on
--
on
the
basic
question,
there
are
--
let's
see.
there
was
litigation
(inaudible)
--
the
second
circuit
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
there
were
earlier
questions
about
admiralty
jurisdiction.
i
must
say,
there's
been
a
lot
of
preliminary
litigation
over
an
issue.
when
you
get
to
it,
it
seems
to
me,
to
turn
out
to
be
rather
disappointing.
but
the
--
the
--
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
preceded
any
litigation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
oh
--
oh
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
the
--
the
basic
clause
provides
that
at
the
end
of
each
calendar
year,
he
shall
account
within
30
days
and
pay
over
what's
due.
there
was
added
to
the
clause
a
provision
that
says
that
the
charterer
agrees
to
make
preliminary
payments
on
account
of
additional
charter
hire
at
basically
any
time
during
the
year
on
demand.
now,
that
means
that
he
has
had
a
voyage
and
has
made
profits.
the
clause
doesn't
require
him
to
account
for
those
until
the
end
of
the
year.
the
government
may
however,
by
this
new
provision,
require
him
tentatively
to
give
us
our
share
of
those
profits
and
if
he
has
losses
later
during
the
year,
we
will
then,
on
the
later
accounting,
adjust
for
that
and
pay
it
back.
so,
this
is
a
provision
for
tentative
payments
during
the
life
of
the
contract
and
it
provides
that
no
payments
of
this
sort
will
prejudice
anybody's
rights.
of
course
they
don't
prejudice
anybody's
rights.
it's
just
a
payment
on
account
and
then
at
the
end,
you
towed
up
the
profit
and
loss
and
who
is
entitled
to
what
share.
now,
i
have
only
a
few
minutes.
i
want
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
second
question
on
this
split-year
accounting.
in
december
of
1947,
december
1947,
the
shipping
industry
which
have
previously
been
very
profitable,
the
immediate
post-war
demand
and
the
shortage
of
ships
had
produced
very
great
profits
and
most
of
the
charterers
had
large
profits.
by
1947,
the
demand
had
slackened
and
the
fleet
had
been
increased.
there
was
excess
tonnage.
many
complaints
were
made
to
the
commission
about
the
excessive
number
of
chartered
vessels
afloat
and
the
committees
of
congress
complained
about
it
and
wanted
the
commission
to
do
something
about
it.
they
were
undercutting
the
privately
owned
fleet.
and,
after
all,
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
move
the
privately
owned
fleet
and
the
charterers
were
out
undercutting
the
privately
owned
fleet.
it
was
reported
that
they
were
operating
at
losses.
now,
since
they
had
the
right
to
terminate
the
contract
on
15-day's
notice,
it
may
be
wondered
why
they
continued
to
operate
at
losses
undercutting
other
people
since
they
could
always
turn
the
ship
back.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
was
an
unintended
--
this
is
an
unintended
effect
of
the
progressive
rate
of
profit-sharing.
now,
the
first
profit
which
was
10%
of
return,
which
--
by
the
way,
for
convenience,
i
could
reduce
that
10%
return
to
a
fixed
amount
a
day.
it
works
out
to
be
basically
a
fixed
amount
a
day.
let's
say
its
$20
a
day,
represents
the
10%
return.
so,
the
structure
of
the
contract
was
the
first
$20
the
charterer
kept.
the
next
$100
he
split
50-50
with
the
government.
the
next
$200
he
split
75
to
the
government,
25
to
the
charterer,
and
anything
over
that
was
90%
to
the
government.
now,
it
was
on
a
per
day
accounting
basis.
now,
the
more
days
--
if
he
had
--
he
had
profits
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
that
were
in
the
90%
bracket,
the
more
days
that
he
had
stay
--
he
was
afloat,
he
could
use
in
the
accounting,
with
making
no
additional
profits,
he
could
reduce
--
he
could
take
the
90%
money
and
put
it
down
in
a
lower
bracket
so
that
it
paid
a
charterer
who
had
beginning
of
the
year
profits
to
continue
to
operate
even
if
necessary
at
a
loss.
he
could
not
afford
to
turn
the
ship
back.
i
--
i
can
demonstrate
that.
i
had
an
example
some
place.
here
it
is.
if
he
had
$640
profits
in
one
day,
just
take
a
very
simplified
case.
one
day,
you
have
$640
profits.
the
charterer
would
keep
only
$152
of
that.
most
of
it,
$320
of
it,
will
be
the
90%
bracket.
he
could
keep
only
$152.
if
he
could
spread
that
same
profit
over
two
days,
he
would
keep
$240
of
it.
so
--
and,
in
fact,
on
the
second
day,
so
long
as
he
didn't
suffer
a
loss
after
$340,
he
was
still
ahead.
so,
the
fact
of
this
progressive
rate
structure,
i
think,
unanticipated,
as
it
turns
out
in
50
--
1947,
was
that
charterers
were
continuing
to
operate
at
a
loss
with
the
pressure
of
the
--
beginning
of
the
year
profits
forcing
them
to.
they
made
money
by
operating
in
a
loss,
which
is
at
--
not
what
congress
wanted
assuredly
to
have
the
charterers
out
undercutting
the
private
fleet
and
carrying
trade
at
a
loss.
now,
it
was
to
force
charterers
to
turn
in
their
ships
if
they
didn't
have
profitable
use
of
them,
that
the
commission
terminated
the
existing
contracts
and
require
the
charterers,
if
they
want
to
keep
the
ships,
to
agree
to
an
addendum
requiring
them
to
account
separately
from
thereon
so
that
anybody
who
didn't
foresee,
who
was
engaging
in
loss
traffic,
couldn't
afford
to
continue.
it
didn't
pay
him
any
longer
to
continue
to
engage
in
loss
traffic
and
he
would
turn
it
in,
and
it
was
effective.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
1947?
no,
it
was
1946.
in
1946
we
--
they
adopted
the
provision
that
is
in
this
contract.
that
was
adopted
in
1946.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
--
in
1946.
actually,
the
eastern
company
had
held
some
more
shipping
administration
charters.
in
1946,
those
were
terminated
and
they
signed
the
new
form
of
contract
in
1946.
there's
no
issue
about
that.
the
issue
about
the
termination
is
in
1947.
in
the
summer
of
1947,
in
order
to
prevent
these
excess
chartered
boats
from
staying
out
in
the
traffic
and
demoralizing
the
traffic,
the
commission
found
it
necessary
to
terminate
and
require
them,
if
they
wanted
to
keep
the
ships,
to
do
so
under
a
new
contract.
let
me
say,
this
fully
is
in
accord
with
their
rights
under
the
contract
and
i
think,
fully
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
thank
you.
