why
don't
you
just
--
why
don't
you
just
ask
that
if
you
haven't
asked,
you
couldn't
be
overruled,
i
mean
just,
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
assuming
that
you're
right,
why
shouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
it
come
with
reference
to
7,
it
just
seems
that's
4.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
he
know
the
distinction
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
maybe
it
was
wrong
but
i'd
be
interested
tomorrow
to
know
how
you
can
draw
that
distinction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
every
case
is
settled
for
considerations
and
if
you
can
come
before
us
and
we
accept
that
settlement
making
it
moot.
it
really,
you
say
not
for
or
ordained
that
can't
be
raised
again
because
the
settlement
could
be
a
fact
on
the
ground,
the
problem
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
really
interesting
question
and
i
frankly
have
not
thought
about
it
and
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
leads
to
the
idea
that
this
court
frequently
hold
cases
moot
when
they
are
--
it
may
turn
out
not
to
be
moot
at
all,
leaves
the
idea
in
my
mind
that
the
court
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
besides
the
(inaudible)
of
discretion
and
i
thought
you
were
required,
the
people
to
go.
you
show
that
there's
mootness
within
a
certainty.
