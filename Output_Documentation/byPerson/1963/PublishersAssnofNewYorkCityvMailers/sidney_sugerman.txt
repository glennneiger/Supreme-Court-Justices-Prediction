mr.
sidney
sugerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
at
once
to
the
answer
just
given
by
mr.
hughes
to
justice
harlan's
question.
the
mootness
as
we
contend
occurred
on
february
4th,
1964
after
certiorari
had
been
granted
and
after
the
petitioner's
brief
had
been
filed
immediately
before
our
own
brief
had
been
filed.
and
it
occurred
by
reason
of
a
letter
written
by
i
should
say,
signed
by
because
the
wording
of
it
was
prepared
by
myself
in
my
office
in
the
presence
of
the
president
of
the
local
union.
i
had
called
both
mr.
kelly
and
the
president
into
my
office
after
i've
been
informed
that
mr.
kelly
had
no
further
interest
in
prosecuting
the
charge
against
his
fellow
member,
mr.
rowan
and
some
15
months
having
gone
by
since
the
incident
which
gave
rise
to
the
dispute
between
those
two
gentlemen.
and
their
friendship
having
been
restored,
he
just
had
no
further
interest
in
the
matter.
we
thought
we
should
call
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
in
it,
it
said
that
he
not
only
withdrew
the
charge
but
moreover
and
this
appears
at
page
--
page
7
of
the
suggestion
of
mootness
that
he
request
the
union
to
cease
any
further
processing
of
his
charge
and
to
terminate
all
proceedings
against
member
rowan
in
connection
therewith.
moreover,
i
shall
not
make
any
grievance
against
member
rowan
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
publishers
in
connection
with
those
incidents.
and
then
appended
to
that
was
an
affidavit
again
which
i
prepared
for
the
president
of
the
local
union
reciting
the
withdrawal
of
the
charge,
the
fact
that
he
was
dissolving
the
investigating
committee
which
had
been
created.
he
was
terminating
all
internal
union
proceedings
in
connection
therewith.
and
in
his
concluding
paragraph,
the
president
of
the
union
says
that
mr.
kelly
having
assured
the
union
that
he
will
initiate
no
further
proceedings
against
member
rowan
in
connection
with
or
growing
out
of
the
incident
that
he
will
make
no
grievance
thereon
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
union
will
entertain
and
take
no
further
proceedings
of
any
kind,
whatever
against
member
rowan,
all
the
publisher
in
behalf
of
member
kelly
and
in
that
connection.
i
don't
know
a
more
explicit
way
of
saying
that
this
matter
in
dispute
as
between
kelly
and
rowan,
and
out
of
which
grew
the
dispute
between
the
publisher
and
the
local
union
was
finally
at
an
end
and
irrecoverably
at
an
end.
it
could
not
be
reinstituted.
the
union
so
stated
it
would
not
process
the
matter
and
copies
of
these
were
immediate
of
this
letter
and
that
the
affidavit
were
immediately
delivered
to
the
publisher's
attorney
suggesting
to
them
that
the
matter
has
become
moot.
at
any
rate,
if
i
may
put
this
case
in
its
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
surely
sir.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
it
would
not
sir.
the
president
of
the
union
has
said
that
he
would
not
--
that
the
union
would
not
entertain
or
take
any
proceedings
upon
any
further
charge
growing
out
of
the
incidents
of
august
12,
1962
which
had
given
rise
to
this
matter.
of
course
it
had
not
pledged
itself,
never
again
to
process
a
charge
against
a
foreman
member
of
the
union
brought
either
by
kelly
or
by
anyone
else
growing
out
of
new
incidents.
so
that
the
ultimate
question
the
publisher
would
like
to
have
decided
once
and
for
all
is
still
an
open
question
but
one
could
be
decided
as
we
now
acknowledge
by
an
arbitrator.
and
why
this
court
should
be
bothered
with
this
question
is
beyond
me
frankly.
that
matter
has
been
arbitrable
for
the
past
16
months.
judge
murphy
had
ordered
the
case
to
arbitration
on
november
20th,
1962.
the
union
took
an
appeal
from
that
portion
of
judge
murphy's
order
as
well
as
from
the
order
enjoining
the
internal
union
proceedings.
but
we
had
no
stay.
the
arbitration
was
not
pushed
by
the
publisher
as
it
was
privileged
to
advance
it.
and
on
may
20th,
1963,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
portion
of
judge
murphy's
order
which
compelled
arbitrations.
we
took
no
appeal
from
that
and
we
have
been
awaiting
the
day
the
publisher
would
carry
the
matter
to
arbitration.
now,
the
only
substantive
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
mere
filing
and
entertaining
of
a
charge
against
the
member
is
a
violation
of
that
provision
in
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
we
shall
not
discipline
a
foreman
member
for
carrying
out
the
management's
instructions.
the
substantive
question
is
one
which
shall
be
determined
by
an
arbitrator
when
and
if
we
ever
get
to
that
day.
but
this,
it
seems
to
me
and
i
have
suggested
this
in
our
papers
right
along
is
not
what
the
publisher
desires.
it
doesn't
want
the
substantive
question
decided
it
or
else
it
could've
had
it
decided
a
year
ago.
it
wants
an
injunction.
that
is
the
end
in
itself
as
it
appears
to
us.
and
notwithstanding
and
i
have
difficulty
following
the
contentions
of
the
publisher
from
time
to
time.
it
says
in
its
--
in
its
brief
and
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
acknowledges
that
the
action
that
instituted
under
section
301
sought
the
main
relief
of
an
order
compelling
arbitration
to
which
the
so-called
stay
or
injunction
was
merely
incidental.
now,
it
comes
to
this
court
after
the
mootness
question
arose
and
says,
"well,
that
isn't
what
we
want
ultimately.
we
want
to
know
by
a
declaration
of
rights
by
this
court
that
we
may
get
an
injunction
in
this
type
of
case."
and
as
justice
goldberg
put
it
in
his
question
yesterday
to
mr.
hughes,
it
seems
that
what
the
publisher
wants
here
is
an
advisory
opinion
for
the
government
of
the
future
affairs
between
this
local
union
and
the
publisher
in
respect
to
possible
disciplining
of
a
foreman
and
whether
or
not,
the
mere
filing
of
the
charge
constitutes
such
discipline.
now,
we
are
confident
that
before
an
arbitrator,
if
we
ever
get
there,
that
will
be
held
that
the
mere
filing
of
the
charge
and
ministerial
investigation
of
the
charge
so
as
to
sift
the
facts
and
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
what
the
union's
constitution
calls
cognizable
that
is
on
its
face
whether
the
charge
is
worthy
of
trial
and
then
ultimately
whether
it
should
go
to
a
trial.
that
that
question
of
whether
the
processing
of
the
charge
in
that
state
is
an
act
of
discipline
in
violation
of
section
20
(c)
of
the
contract
is
something
which,
as
i
say,
we're
confident
an
arbitrator
will
decide
in
our
favor.
but
--
and
i
say
this
notwithstanding
what
i
have
referred
to
i
believe
as
a
gratuity
on
the
part
of
judge
murphy
which
you'll
find
in
his
opinion
in
the
record
on
page
4,
in
the
last
two
sentences
of
the
second
whole
paragraph
on
that
page.
judge
murphy
said,
this
is
an
extremely
broad
arbitration
clause
and
certainly
broad
enough
to
include
the
present
dispute
plus
the
fact
that
section
20
(c)
prohibits
the
disciplining
of
plaintiff's
foreman.
certainly
he
said,
"this
must
include
the
filing
of
charges
against
him."
well,
that's
the
ultimate
question
of
course
for
an
arbitrator
and
judge
murphy
should
not
have
made
the
law
of
the
case
so
to
speak
that
would
govern
the
arbitrator.
but,
judge
murphy
notwithstanding
and
with
all
respect
stated
otherwise.
we
are
confident
that
the
proceeding
in
its
nature
within
the
union
is
such
that
the
mere
filing
of
a
charge,
the
mere
investigation
of
the
charge
is
not
an
act
of
discipline
contemplated
by
the
contract.
and
an
act
of
discipline
in
any
case
or
possibly
an
act
of
discipline
which
this
court
or
any
federal
court
are
to
concern
itself
with
in
--
in
merely
aiding
the
arbitration
process
for
the
court
intrudes
itself
into
the
merits
of
the
arbitration
dispute
when
it
so
much
as
enjoins
for
the
time
being
pending
arbitration.
the
very
act
which
is
alleged
to
be
a
violation
of
contract
and
contrary
wise
as
alleged
not
to
be
a
violation
of
contract
does
not
frustrate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
not
something
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
contract.
it
is
--
i
should
like
to
say
this.
the
dispute
on
the
substantive
merits
in
our
view
is
a
premature
dispute
which
as
we
contended
on
successfully
was
not
even
right
for
arbitration.
and
perhaps,
it
is
best
left
to
an
arbitrator
to
decide
that
it
is
not
right
for
arbitration
rather
than
for
a
court
to
bother
to
say
so.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
no.
this
is
the
first
time
this
local
union
has
ever
had
a
dispute
with
the
publisher
over
this.
there
are
no
charges
filed
by
mr.
kelly
against
any
foreman.
i
know
of
no
charges
that
have
been
filed.
the
last
i
heard
of
was
back
in
september
1962
filed
against
any
foreman
at
any
newspaper.
and
i
might
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
no.i
shouldn't
say
that
they
were
stimulated
by
the
union.
the
matter
was
brought
to
my
attention
for
the
first
time
on
february
3rd
or
4th.
it
was
brought
to
my
attention
by
the
president
of
the
local
union
who
told
me
that
--
you
know,
kelly
isn't
interested
in
this
case
anymore
and
he
doesn't
care
and
i
think
it
all
arose
a
question
of
whether
mr.
kelly
would
come
down
here
to
hear
the
argument
in
the
case
in
which
he
had
had
this
little
bit
of
contributory
interest.
and
--
well
kelly
isn't
interested
anymore.
kelly
and
rowan
who
would
huff
and
puff
at
each
other
one
night
on
august
14th,
1962
are
good
friends
again.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honors
just
done
him
a
favor
and
kelly
is
going
to
get
nothing
out
of
this.
now,
routinely
when
a
kelly,
a
member
of
the
union
or
a
member
of
a
bargaining
unit
covered
by
our
contract
has
a
beef
if
you
will,
against
the
foreman
or
against
the
management
routinely
and
this
has
occurred
over
the
65
years
or
so
of
our
effective
and
cajoled
collective
bargaining
relations
with
these
publishers.
they
file
grievance
in
the
regular
way.
grievance
is
processed
and
if
necessary
goes
to
arbitration.
it
is
only
when
a
--
an
employee
conceives
himself
to
be
wronged
by
a
foreman
who
was
his
only
point
of
contact
with
management.
contract
provides
that
the
foreman
has
exclusive
authority
in
the
mailroom.
when
he
feels
himself
aggrieved
by
a
foreman
acting
outside
his
apparent
authority
or
his
expressed
authority
and
the
sense
of
aggrievement
cannot
be
vindicated
through
the
collective
bargaining
processes
--
arbitration
that
he
may
feel
himself
compelled
to
run
to
the
union
and
file
a
charge
against
the
brother
member
for
not
behaving
as
a
good
brother.
that
was
what
this
was
about.
now
actually,
after
the
huffing
and
puffing
that
night
when
mr.
rowan,
the
foreman
found
something
had
gone
wrong
in
his
mailroom
and
had
balled
out
a
group
of
employees
not
specifically
identifying
kelly.
kelly
got
into
an
argument
with
him,
"are
you
threatening
me?"
and
as
i
say
they
huffed
and
puffed
and
then
in
the
idiom,
mr.
kelly
asked
for
it
and
he
got
it.
he
was
given
one
week
disciplinary
suspension
without
pay.
and
--
just
to
correct
one
minor
error
of
fact
that
mr.
hughes
made
yesterday,
i'm
sure
quite
inadvertently
that
kelly
went
after
rowan
and
said,
"i
will
charge
you
at
the
union."
well,
that
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
record
at
pages
13
and
14,
i
beg
your
pardon,
12
and
13
of
the
record,
you
have
the
charge
and
supporting
papers
and
on
page
47,
mr.
rowan's
reply
to
it
within
the
union.
and
mr.
rowan
simply
--
simply
recites
the
facts
and
says
that
kelly
is
--
in
its
final
paragraph
on
47,
mr.
kelly
is
under
the
opinion
that
he
got
the
week
off
for
his
neglect
of
duty.
however,
his
attitude
and
insubordination
contributed
greatly
to
the
week
off.
now
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
must
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
union
which
says
that
a
charge
once
made
and
withdrawn
may
not
be
refiled.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
well,
apart
from
the
technicality
and
the
union
as
you
might
imagine
within
its
own
domain
and
processes
probably
is
not
that
technical
that
it
would
require
preparation
in
filing
of
new
papers.
there
might
be
some
--
some
proceeding
imaginable
under
which
they
would
reviolate
proceeding
on
a
proper
showing.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
with
prejudice.
yes
sir.
i
should've
said
that.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
suppose
--
yes.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
if
you
want
to
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
(inaudible)
mr.
sidney
sugerman
sir,
i
would
--
i
would
conjure
up
any
situation.
if
you
wanted
to
charge
the
president
of
the
union
with
having
coerced
him
into
it
or
the
attorney
for
the
union
myself
for
having
twisted
his
arm,
i
suppose
it
would
make
these
charges.
i'm
satisfied
personally,
i
represent
to
you
as
attorney
at
your
bar
that
i
specifically
question
mr.
kelly
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
under
any
instructions,
coercion,
any
kind
of
pressure
at
all
to
withdraw
the
charge.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
absolutely
none
at
all.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
in
all
honesty,
i
must
say
to
you
that
even
if
mr.
laura,
the
president
of
the
union
who
says,
"i
accept
this
withdrawal
with
prejudice
and
the
union
will
not
process
the
matter."
our
local
union
is
that
democratically
run
that
if
the
matter
will
put
to
the
membership
on
the
floor,
i
suppose
the
president
of
the
union
could
be
overruled.
and
of
course,
he
comes
up
for
reelection
next
november
and
if
he
is
not
elected,
i
don't
know
what
the
next
president
would
do.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
it
might
be
mr.
kelly
himself.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
yes.
i
--
but
i
--
i
should
think
that
they're
ought
--
ought
to
be
and
as
i
have
sensed
from
your
cases
generally,
there
has
been
some
threat
or
likelihood
of
a
revival
of
the
matter
or
recommission
of
the
act
enjoined
complaining
that.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
well
then
i
don't
know
what
--
how
you
could
ever
be
sure
of
mootness.
i
--
i
suppose
no
matter
what
were
presented
to
you
to
satisfy
you
that
the
matter
was
moot
conceivably,
it
might
be
undone
on
a
showing
of
fraud
and
overreaching
pressure
and
so
on.
i
--
i
didn't
think
and
i
am
assure
the
court
is
not
looking
for
business
that
much
that
it
wants
cases
unless
affirmatively
and
conclusively
to
be
shown
that
the
case
ought
to
be
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
--
rejected
by
it.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
think
that
was
on
the
basis
that
there
was
an
injunction
bond
on
which
there
was
a
continuing
lia
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
--
liability.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
am
--
i
am
just
--
i
am
not
saying
that
it
can
be
and
then
i
don't
think
i'm
giving
you
nothing
with
the
--
complete
as
frankness,
i
am
conceiving
what
might
happen
if
the
matter
were
put
again
to
the
union
by
mr.
kelly
on
charges
now
that
he
had
been
put
upon
and
coerced
into
withdrawing.
i
just
can't
imagine
really
that
it
would
happen
and
possibly,
my
answer
to
you
should
have
been
a
more
practical
one,
not
less
frank
but
a
more
practical
one.
no,
it
couldn't
happen
in
real
life.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
so
it
seems
to
me.
and
i
--
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
think
in
a
work
or
day
life,
you've
got
to
act
on
certain
practical
assumptions
and
--
in
this
area
and
i
just
cannot
conceive
that
this
matter
and
frankly,
i
have
a
little
concern,
no
little
concern
i
should
put
it
that
way
rather,
as
to
my
professional
role
in
mooting
this
case
so
to
speak
or
participating
in
the
mooting
of
it
as
i
thought
i
was
doing.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
well,
that
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
yes.
and
i
--
i
would
think
--
now
i
--
let
me
say
this
as
far
as
mr.
kelly
is
concern,
when
we
turned
over
to
the
publishers'
counsel,
the
kelly
letter
and
the
tom
laura
affidavit
concerning
the
mootness.
we
said
that
while
this
--
in
our
judgment
moots
the
case
before
the
supreme
court,
of
course
it
does
not
moot
the
underlying
substantive
question
as
one
of
historical
interest.
did
the
union
by
having
accepted
the
charge
and
undertaken
to
investigate
it
violate
section
20
(c).
as
to
that,
we're
ready
to
go
to
arbitration.
now,
that
in
itself
it
would
seem
to
me
has
the
publishers
with
what
i
should
suppose
be
proper
cooperativeness
in
the
pursuit
of
its
own
interest.
he
should've
advanced
to
arbitration.
and
we've
had
this
matter
all
closed
for
one
thing
if
an
arbitrator
had
ruled
adversely
or
would've
ruled
adversely
to
the
publisher
and
hold
that
the
mere
filing
and
investigation
of
the
charge
do
not
constitute
forbidden
discipline
on
a
foreman
member.
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
question
forevermore.
now,
one
may
say
of
course,
you
don't
have
stare
decisis
in
the
arbitration
lore.
and
it's
true.
i
suppose
the
publisher
could
file
for
arbitration
again
and
we
say
we
are
not
bound
by
the
last
arbitrator's
decision.
it's
not
as
in
court
that
we
don't
have
that
convention.
although,
we
arbitrators
say
that
we
look
at
other
arbitrator's
decisions
for
their
possible
persuasiveness
are
not
bound
by
them.
but
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
--
this
question
could've
been
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
the
--
the
original
question?
mr.
sidney
sugerman
within
the
union?
mr.
sidney
sugerman
oh,
i
would
--
i
would
advice
that
the
union
reject
the
charge
and
not
let
it
--
and
that
the
president
in
his
ministerial
capacity
who
otherwise
under
the
constitution
is
obligated
to
bring
the
charge
and
the
answer
before
the
next
regular
membership
meeting
for
consideration
of
its
cognizability,
prima
facie
showing
of
possible
a
case.
i
would
advise
the
president
in
his
ministerial
capacity
do
not
bring
it
to
the
membership
floor.
you
have
made
an
affidavit
in
which
you
said
the
union
will
not
process
this.
again,
to
--
suppose
a
member
gets
up
on
the
floor,
makes
emotional
rule
to
bring
the
matter
up
even
though
the
president
hasn't
put
along
the
agenda.
but
you
know,
this
--
this
case
and
--
of
the
prematurity
of
it
in
any
event
if
i
may
get
back
from
the
mootness
which
relates
to
the
deadness
of
the
matter
to
what
we
have
referred
to
as
the
prematurity
of
it,
this
--
this
case
had
its
inception
in
a
premature
birth
of
something
which
indeed
if
not
still
born
had
no
such
viability
as
to
outlast
the
inactivity
of
the
publisher
and
not
advancing
the
case
to
arbitration.
but,
the
publisher
on
learning
that
a
charge
had
been
filed
within
the
union
by
kelly
against
fellow
member
rowan
who
was
the
publishers'
foreman
protested
that
the
charge
should
not
be
entertained
at
all.
it
should
not
be
investigated
and
so
on.
and
the
union
--
and
said
otherwise
will
make
a
grievance
of
this
and
take
you
to
arbitration.
and
the
union
responded
to
that
by
saying
that
your
letter
is
both
presumptuous
and
premature.
you
are
intrudingly
--
you
don't
belong.
you
have
no
legitimate
concern
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
union.
it's
time
and
up
for
you
to
be
concerned
and
until
then,
it's
a
vicious
intermeddling
on
your
part.
but
it's
time
enough
for
you
to
be
concerned
only
when
and
if
having
investigated
the
matter,
having
brought
mr.
rowan
to
trial
if
this
should
happen.
and
mr.
rowan
having
been
found
guilty
and
mr.
rowan
having
been
disciplined
or
some
imposition
made
upon
him,
time
enough
for
you
then
to
tell
us
that
we're
violating
section
20
(c).
well,
they
have
a
right
to
contend
before
an
arbitrator
that
i
suppose
if
mr.
kelly
had
as
mr.
hughes
mistakenly
said,
if
mr.
kelly
had
said
to
mr.
rowan,
"i
will
file
a
charge
against
you."
i
suppose
they
could
say
that
was
--
that
would
discipline
the
foreman
in
itself.
they
can
say
what
they
want
to
before
an
arbitrator
so
long
as
it's
arbitrable,
you
can
make
any
preposterous
or
sound
or
meritorious,
non-meritorious
contention
you
want
to.
that
isn't
the
same
as
saying
that
when
you
get
into
court
for
an
injunction
in
effectuation
of
the
arbitration
process,
the
court
is
going
to
weigh
the
merits
of
the
matter
and
--
and
hold
the
conduct
for
the
time
being
to
abide
the
outcome
of
arbitration.
for
that
puts
the
court
right
back
in
the
business
of
doing
that
which
norris-laguardia
and
the
strengths
of
the
court
in
general
have
decided
in
our
system
the
courts
would
not
get
into.
and
as
justice
goldberg
put
it
yesterday
if
the
union
members
could
refuse
to
work
with
foreman
rowan
because
he
was
unbrotherly
if
you
will,
and
so
they
struck.
this
court
would
not
entertain
jurisdiction
of
the
matter.
now,
i
don't
think
i
haven't
suppose
the
rationale
sinclair
to
be
so
finely
confined
to
the
fact
that
--
well,
it's
a
strike
and
a
strike
is
something
which
shouldn't
have
joined.
but
the
whole
rationale
of
sinclair
was
that
the
courts
are
not
in
the
injunction
business
anymore.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
well
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
yes
--
yes
sir.
i
--
i'm
frank
to
say.
i
--
i
concentrated
my
own
attention
more
upon
the
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
--
the
local
bylaws
and
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
and
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
oh
yes.
yes
of
course.
the
local
laws
are
--
are
supplemental
only
and
in
large
partly,
they
carry
over
the
same
provisions
but
not
always.
but
where
they
don't,
the
vacuum
is
filled
in
by
the
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
sir
--
mr.
sidney
sugerman
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
so
--
i
shouldn't
want
to
have
to
rely
upon
this
if
mr.
kelly
for
some
crazy
reason
filed
a
charge
and
i
--
i
just
can't
be
any
franker
about
it
than
i
--
i
have
been,
it
can't,
it
won't,
and
if
called
upon
as
counsel
for
the
local
union
should
he
file
a
charge
in
this
connection,
i
would
undertake
to
defend
against
him
even
if
he
proceeded
against
this
in
the
landrum
--
under
the
landrum-griffin
or
otherwise
for
not
giving
him
fair
representation
and
so
on.
mr.
sidney
sugerman
thank
you.
