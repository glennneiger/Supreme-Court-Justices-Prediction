(inaudible)

that
this
case
would've
been
disposed
off
as
moot
but
nevertheless
go
ahead
and
press
the
charges
continually?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
me
on
the
mootness
question
if
in
fact
the
union,
if
this
case
were
now
disposed
off,
could
reinstate
the
proceedings
against
this
party.

or
--
well
--
or
you
do
not
know
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
does
--
does
this
have
a
bearing
on
the
mootness
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
say
--
the
letter
say
something
that
they've
never
revived
them
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
see
my
--
you
see
my
difficulty
if
in
fact
nothing
can
ever
happen,
then
how
was
--
they
rely
on
section
7
issues?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
suppose
there
is
no
possibility
to
that,
would
you
then
concede
that
as
to
this
one
the
situation
is
moot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
familiar
with
what
we
do
and
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
wipe
the
slate
clean
all
the
way
down.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
leave
anything
that
was
done
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
expunged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
none
of
the
technical
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
a
--
it's
vacated,
completely
expunged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
hughes
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
that,
have
you
just
said
to
us
whatever
maybe
the
reason,
picked
or
otherwise
that
if
we
file
the
charge,
you
can't
tell
us
that
the
processes
for
the
handling
of
those
charges
would
not
be
followed
on
a
re-filing,
can
it?
there's
nothing
i
gather
in
the
union
constitution
of
bylaws
which
says
that
if
he
does
re-file
that
he's
not
entitled
to
have
the
pros
--
have
it
processed
as
the
original
one
would've
been
processed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
in
that
circumstance,
can
we
really
say
that
it's
moot
in
the
sense
that
we
ought
just
forget
this
issue
and
expunge
the
record
below.
now
we
--
only
a
few
weeks
ago,
we
refused
to
do
that
in
a
case,
a
state
case
i
believe,
where
it
was
represented
to
us
with
an
injunction.the
one
who
got
it
no
longer
wanted
it
and
we
refused
to
vacate
on
mootness
and
so
they
actually
expunged
the
injunction
because
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
this
is
not
much
different
from
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
that
mr.
hughes,
(inaudible)
we
wouldn't
take
a
state's
determination
of
mootness.
we
made
a
determination
for
ourselves
and
held
there
was
no
mootness
and
went
on
to
reach
and
decide
the
merits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
give
us
anything
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
give
us
nothing
to
--
not
to
suggest
that
you
did
the
same
as
quite
contrary.
as
i
understand
you
that
this
still
could
be
reopened,
still
could
be
processed
even
if
we
were
now
to
go
with
you
on
the
--d
