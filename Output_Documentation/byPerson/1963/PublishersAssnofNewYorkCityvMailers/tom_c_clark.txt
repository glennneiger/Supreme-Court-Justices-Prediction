--
i
read

justice

--
i
wondered
if
he

he
could
get
anywhere
re-filing
whether
the
union
or
whoever
the
proper
authority
wouldn't
say
that,
"well,
you
dismissed
it
with
prejudice."

(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.

as
i
understand
you
say
that
(inaudible)
file
again
that
you
would
recommend
or
rather
view
(inaudible)
by
the
union
to
arbitrate
that
(inaudible)
that
complaint?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
have
filed
--
suppose
they
filed
--
this
man
filed
its
complaint
again
and
--
justice
tom
c.
clark

would
you
do
then?
