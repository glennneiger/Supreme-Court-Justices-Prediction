mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
i'm
sorry.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
part
of
an
order
of
the
district
court
in
new
york
which
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit.
it
--
the
second
circuit
vacated
a
stay
that
had
been
granted
in
an
action
brought
under
section
301,
to
have
part
of
law,
to
compel
arbitration.
now,
that
portion
of
the
order
compelling
arbitration
was
left
undisturbed
but
in
addition
to
the
order
compelling
arbitration,
we
had
sought
a
further
order
from
the
district
court
staying
the
union
here
from
taking
action
which
we
believed
was
inconsistent
with
the
issue
to
be
arbitrated
and
which
we
felt
that
if
this
action
had
been
taken
by
the
union,
we
would
have
been
deprived
to
--
before
our
hearing,
before
the
arbitrator
of
the
merits
of
our
contention.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
stay
which
we
received
because
it
felt
that
the
norris-laguardia
act,
section
7,
applied
to
it
and
that
the
procedural
provisions
of
section
7
had
not
been
followed
and
indeed,
they
noted
and
we
agree,
could
not
have
been
followed
in
the
case.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
--
the
issue
that
we
had,
it
involved
the
disciplining
of
foremen
who
are
employed
by
the
publishers.
we
have
a
--
a
common
contract
here
to
which
all
the
new
york
city
publishers
are
signatory
with
this
particular
union,
in
new
york
mailer's
union
number
six.
that
union
is
an
affiliate
of
the
international
typographical
union.
and
historically,
in
the
relationships
with
this
union
and
with
other
unions,
the
publisher's
foremen
are
required
to
be
members
of
the
union.
and
that
isn't
all
bad.
it
has
some
--
some
bad
aspects
to
it
from
our
point
of
view
but
it
also
has
some
good
aspects
and
we're
not
here
complaining
about
that
contractual
requirement.
we
accept
it,
indeed,
we
must.
we
wish
to
get
out
from
it
the
--
it's
--
we
should
negotiate
out
of
it.
that's
not
our
issue
here.
but
we
also
negotiated
another
clause
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
we
--
we
have
at
least
been
free
to
arbitrate
since
the
date
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
this
may
28th.
now
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
no,
the
case
has
not
--
the
case
has
not
been
arbitrated.
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
--
we
are
interested
in
this
case
not
only
in
the
issue
that's
going
to
be
arbitrated
namely
whether
or
not
the
union
has
the
right
in
light
of
the
contract
provisions
that
we
have
to
discipline
a
foreman
and
what
constitutes
discipline.
all
those
issues
are
--
are
fully
arbitrated.
we
are
also
interested
in
--
in
the
remedy.
we're
also
interested
in
being
able
to
have
some
means
of
protecting
our
position,
assuming
that
we
are
right
and
that
an
arbitrator
will
agree
with
us.
before
we
can
get
to
the
arbitration
and
have
that
issue
litigated
on
the
merits
and
in
each
case,
it
maybe
different,
so
that
we
--
we
want
a
remedy
where
we
can
go
to
court
if
needs
be,
if
the
union
will
not
give
it
to
us
without
that,
to
prevent
them,
stop
them
from
going
ahead
and
finishing
the
whole
internal
union
proceeding
before
we
can
get
the
arbitrator
in
order
to
find
out
where
the
line
is
drawn
by
the
contract.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
and
--
to
the
mootness
con
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
--
contention.
and
it
--
it
was
perhaps
fearful
of
--
of
the
potential
mootness
of
the
situation
with
regard
to
this
aspect
of
the
remedy
that
we
didn't
push
the
arbitration
and
even
though
the
union
was
not
under
restraint
any
longer
after
the
court
of
appeals
came
down,
we
asked
them,
"will
you
hold
off
on
the
disciplinary
proceedings?"
and
the
fact
is
they
did
hold
off.
now,
they
say
they
never
promised
to
and
that's
correct.
they
never
said,
"yes,
we
--
we
promise
we
won't
do
it."
they
just
didn't
do
it
and
we
didn't
push
with
the
arbitration.
now,
the
issue
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
no,
not
--
not
at
all
because
i
think
we
--
we
have
a
very
live
and
real
--
real
issue
here.
we
--
we
have
adverse
parties
that
are
very
far
apart
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act,
section
7
for
example.
and
--
and
also
with
regard
to
all
aspects
of
the
issue
as
it's
framed
before
this
court.
we
--
we
think
we
--
we
do
not
have
the
classic
elements
of
mootness
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
we
think
we
have
a
very
large
case
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
not
only
in
this
case
because
there
is
the
possibility
that
even
in
this
case
it
could
be
resumed
but
also
for
future
cases
because
we
feel
that
there
is
a
real
danger
that
this
will
reoccur.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
i
--
we
--
we
have
no
assurance
running
to
us.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
we're
--
we're
not
a
party
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
we're
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
we
don't
know
what
they
can
or
cannot
do
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
we
do
not
know.
we're
not
a
party
to
that.
what
we
have
is
--
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
it
does.
it
does
have
great
bearing
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
mootness
question
but
we
feel
--
we
feel
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
yes
but
the
--
but
the
--
this
--
this
was
done
as
part
of
an
internal
union
proceeding
that
we're
not
a
party
to.
the
promise
didn't
run
to
us.
it
was
just
--
they
called
in
mr.
kelly
who
was
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
we
feel
that
something
can
happen.
we
feel
that
just
as
--
as
they
went
ahead
and
filed
the
charge
in
the
first
place
which
we
thought
they
had
no
right
to
do
under
the
contract.
they
could
turn
around
and
start
it
up
again
tomorrow.
maybe
that
isn't
very
likely
but
we
feel
that
is
a
possibility
and
it's
also
a
possibility
that
there
maybe
some
new
incidents,
some
--
some
new
occasions.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
if
--
if
there
were
no
possibility
at
all
then
in
this
case,
there
would
be
a
technical
mootness
as
to
this.
but
nevertheless,
i
would
urge
on
the
court
because
of
the
nature
of
this
whole
problem
and
the
fact
that
if
we
are
deprived
of
our
remedy
now,
our
chances
of
ever
getting
here
again
are
very
remote
because
here,
we're
faced
with
a
--
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
circuit
saying
that
you
can't
have
a
stay
under
these
circumstances.
and
even
if
it's
vacated
on
mootness
grounds
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes,
i
am.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
right.
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes.
well,
perhaps
in
a
--
in
a
technical
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
--
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
i
would
have
much
chance
of
convincing
the
district
court
judge
as
we
were
able
to
do
in
this
case
and
in
several
other
cases
where
--
where
this
issue
came
up
with
other
unions,
to
grant
me
the
stay
when
the
circuit
court's
decision
on
the
merits
was
only
vacated
on
the
ground
of
mootness.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
and
--
and
if
i
don't
get
the
stay
in
the
first
instance,
if
i
don't
get
the
stay
in
the
first
instance
from
the
district
court,
the
thing
is
over,
then
it's
really
moot.
the
discipline
goes
ahead
and
our
position
is
lost
if
it
has
any
merit.
now,
the
--
the
issue
in
the
arbitration
that
we
want
to
decide
is,
does
it
constitute
discipline
to
summon
the
foreman
down
to
answer
the
charges.
now,
we
negotiated
the
clause
20
(c)
of
the
contract
which
says
with
this
union,
that
the
union
will
not
discipline
the
foreman
for
carrying
out
the
instructions
of
the
management.
and
we
feel
that
it
violates
that
provision
to
call
in
them.
now,
the
union
disagrees
with
that
and
they
said,
"no,
we
have
the
right
to
look
into
it",
and
--
and
so
forth.
the
merits
of
that
issue
are
for
the
arbitrator
and
that's
been
reserved
for
the
arbitrator.
what
we
get
to
in
this
case
is
the
applicability
of
section
7
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act.
now,
mr.
sugarman
before
the
union
goes
further,
he
says
that
section
4
of
norris-la
guardia
act
applies.
he
--
he
takes
the
position
that
4
(b),
which
deals
with
an
injunction
against
becoming
or
remaining
a
member
of
the
union
has
application.
well,
we
resisted
that
contention
at
all
levels
and
it
has
not
been
accepted.
judge
hays
in
the
circuit
court
held
that
section
4
--
none
of
the
provisions,
subdivisions
of
section
4
had
any
application
here
at
all
and
we
think
that
that's
right.
but
judge
hays
did
hold
that
section
7
precluded
us
from
having
the
stay.
now,
we
feel
that
the
lincoln
mills
decision
of
this
court
controls
here.
we
say
that
--
that
the
stay
that
we're
asking
for
here,
it's
merely
telling
the
union,
"hold
up,
don't
go
ahead
with
the
disciplinary
proceedings
until
we
can
get
to
the
arbitrator
and
the
arbitrator
can
decide
whether
or
not
he
should
do
it."
we're
not
asking
that
they'd
be
enjoined
forever
or
prohibited
forever.
we're
just
asking
to
wait
until
we
get
to
the
arbitrator.
now,
we
have
a
provision
in
our
contract.
we
call
it
the
status
quo
clause,
which
provides
that
where
an
issue
was
going
to
go
to
arbitration
that
the
conditions
that
prevail
prior
to
this
dispute
shall
be
maintained
while
the
case
is
going
on
its
way
through
the
--
through
the
process.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
now,
we
think
the
sinclair
case
mr.
justice
harlan
has
no
application
at
all.
it's
distinguishable
on
the
same
grounds
that
within
the
majority
opinion,
the
lincoln
mills
situation
was
distinguished.
we
say
that
here,
as
in
lincoln
mills,
the
conduct
involved
in
the
injunction
was
not
anyone
of
the
kinds
of
conduct
prohibited
to
federal
district
courts
by
section
4
of
the
act,
and
we
say
that's
the
limit
of
the
prohibition
in
that
area.
now,
we
say
that
our
stay
that
we've
been
deprived
off
here
by
the
circuit
court
stands
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
the
mandatory
injunction
compelling
arbitration
which
was
ordered
in
lincoln
mills
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases
that
follow
it.
we're
asking
for
enforcement
of
an
additional
provision
of
our
contract,
our
status
quo
provision.
and
we
say
that
if
that
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
promise
to
arbitrate,
the
promise
to
maintain
the
status
quo
is
the
same
kind
of
a
promise.
and
we
think
that
section
7,
i
think
when
you
read
it
and
--
and
you
look
at
the
--
the
things
that
are
--
that
had
to
be
met
there
was
designed
to
meet
the
situation
where
injunctions
are
granted
in
--
in
cases
of
violence
and
so
forth
and
where
it
is
not
going
to
deal
with
any
of
the
section
4
matters
that
are
prohibited.
and
--
and
we
think
it's
wholly
inapplicable
to
a
situation
as
this
just
as
it
was
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
mandatory
injunction
to
compel.
within
its
own
limits,
we
feel
that
the
--
that
the
sinclair
case
stands
and
we
have
to
accept
it
but
nevertheless,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
situation
here.
if
--
if
norris-la
guardia,
section
7,
applies
to
us
then
we
say
it
also
applied
to
lincoln
mills
and
this
court
said,
"no,
it
didn't."
so
we
feel
that
we're
in
--
we're
in
that
category.
now,
we
--
we
feel
that
the
--
that
the
policy
announced
by
this
court
in
favoring
arbitration
which
is
really
a
--
a
reaffirmation
of
--
of
the
congressional
policy
supports
a
position
that
we
take
here.
we
think
it's
--
it's
important
that
the
parties
in
an
arbitration
get
their
full
relief.
and
--
and
where
the
circumstances
require
some
additional
kind
of
remedy
to
support
and
foster
the
arbitration,
that
relief
shouldn't
be
denied
to
them
unless
it
comes
specifically
within
one
of
the
prohibitions
of
section
4
of
norris-la
guardia
act.
and
here,
we
don't
come
head
on
with
section
4,
so
therefore
we
think
that
the
district
court
in
applying
ordinary
equitable
principles,
which
it
did
when
we
went
down
to
get
our
regional
order
to
show
cause.
we
had
to
satisfy
the
judge
that
we
have
complied
with
rule
65
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
when
we
got
before
the
district
judge,
he
had
to
be
satisfied
that
this
was
a
proper
application
of
the
status
quo
clause
that
--
that
we
would
have
irreparable
injury
if
we
were
denied
the
relief
that
we
sought,
that
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
now,
there's
been
a
recent
case
in
the
local
district
court
here
in
washington
involving
easton
greyhound
company
that
i
think
sort
of
illustrates
in
a
slightly
different
context
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
in
--
in
that
case,
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes,
it's
--
it's
mentioned
in
the
--
in
the
--
our
brief
on
mootness
that
was
decided
after
our
--
our
principle
brief
had
been
written
but
we
made
a
reference
to
it
in
the
response
on
the
issue
of
mootness.
in
--
in
that
case,
the
employer
of
the
--
the
greyhound
bus
company,
was
going
to
move
one
of
its
garages
or
plants
from,
i
think
washington,
d.c
to
some
other
location,
and
the
union
protested
and
claimed
that
the
subject
matter
was
arbitrable.
and
the
employer
didn't
dispute
that
and
as
matter
of
fact,
they
went
ahead
and
made
plans
to
arbitrate
the
issue
but
because
as
often
happens
in
--
in
arbitrations,
they
couldn't
get
the
case
on
to
be
heard
that
quickly.
the
employer
was
going
ahead
implementing
its
plans
to
make
the
move
which
of
course
would
have
frustrated
the
position
of
the
union
there,
if
it
were
right
that
the
employer
had
no
right
under
the
contract
and
an
arbitrator
would
have
so
held
to
move
the
plant.
so
the
union
went
into
the
district
court
and
asked
that
the
employer
be
stayed
from
moving
the
plant
and
the
district
court
considered
that,
mr.
judge
kohlsaat
and
he
granted
the
stay
or
the
injunction
and
norris-la
guardia
was
raised
there.
and
i
think
judge
kohlsaat
quite
properly
held
in
the
circumstances
there
that
norris-la
guardia
should
not
have
application
because
the
subject
matter
involved
was
not
section
4
activity
and
--
and
he
held
that
section
7
shouldn't
apply
either
that
it
was
inapplicable.
now,
i
see
the
time
is
going
short,
is
it
your
pleasure
your
honor
that
i
continue
until
2:30?
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
thank
you.
now,
we
--
we
are
now
in
the
position
in
this
case
of
being
deprived
of
what
we
had
found
to
be
a
very
effective
and
important
remedy
for
the
protection
of
all
foreman
and
--
and
we
feel
very
strongly
about
this
subject
matter.
we
have
had
many
cases
with
other
unions
where
the
man
on
the
floor
giving
an
order
will
dispute
the
order
and
in
fact
threaten
to
have
the
foreman
up
on
charges
before
the
union.
and
--
and
--
we
--
we
don't
like
that.
we
--
we
think
it's
a
very
important
thing
to
show
our
foreman
that
we
stand
behind
them.
the
incident
that
triggered
off
this
case
was
a
very
common
place
thing,
foreman
edward
nolan
(pn)
at
the
new
york
times
said
to
mr.
kelly,
"you
made
a
mistake
in
the
wrapper
room,
don't
let
it
happen
again."
and
kelly
argued
with
him
about
it.
and
if
you
read
in
the
record
the
statements
of
the
--
of
the
two
principles,
it's
a
amusing
little
incident.
kelly
pursued
the
foreman
out
of
the
room
to
continue
the
discussion
and
then
he
did
what
he
said.
he
had
him
up
on
--
on
charges.
now,
we
think
that's
wrong.
we
don't
think
that
our
foreman
should
be
dragged
out
to
union
headquarters
to
answer
for
their
acts
in
the
performance
of
their
official
duties.
we
think
they
should
be
exempt
from
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
that
--
yes.
and
we
--
we've
had
that.
we
--
we've
had
that
in
our
industry.
that's
worst.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
we
could
not
under
sinclair,
we
could
not
have
gone
down.
i
realized
that.
but
what
we
think
that
this
case
does,
it
provides
this
court
an
opportunity
to
give
sanction
to
permissible
relief,
to
draw
the
distinction,
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
between
sinclair
and
lincoln
mills.
now,
i
--
i
didn't
like
the
majority
opinion
in
--
in
sinclair.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
i
--
i
don't
expect
that
that
could
be
done
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
i
would
not
object
at
all
except
that
--
except
that
i
do
agree
that
--
that
the
letter
of
norris-la
guardia
in
sinclair,
did
come
head
on
and
square
on
and
perhaps
the
place
to
get
relief
is
from
congress
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
well,
because
i
do
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes,
i
--
i
--
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session,
mr.
justice
black,
you
asked
me
to
distinguish
between
the
applicability
of
sections
4
and
7,
and
i
think
that
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
merits
of
the
case
here.
certainly,
section
7
is
broader
than
section
4,
but
i
do
not
think
that
as
judge
hayes
in
the
circuit
court
felt
that
section
7
covers
all
other
cases
in
labor
disputes
where
something
called
an
injunction
by
whatever
name
its
known
is
involved.
because
if
that
were
so,
then
the
lincoln
mills
decision
of
this
court
was
wrong.
it
was
prohibited
by
section
7
and
this
court
considered
that
and
--
and
rejected
it
and
found
that
there
was
an
area
where
there
could
be
an
injunction
in
the
labor
dispute
that
is
not
proscribed
or
regulated
by
section
7.
i
think
another
case
is
--
is
the
drake
bakeries
case
of
this
court.
now,
there
was
no
discussion
in
this
court
of
norris-laguardia's
application.
but
there
too,
we
had
a
labor
dispute,
we
had
a
stay
of
a
court
damage
action.
and
if
section
7
applies
to
all
kinds
of
stays
or
injunctions,
it
would've
prevented
the
court
from
issuing
the
stay
of
the
damage
action
in
drake
bakeries.
the
syres
case
in
this
court
where
it
involved
certainly
a
labor
dispute
but
it
involved
elements
of
racial
discrimination
an
injunctive
order
was
allowed
in
that
case
again
without
regard
to
the
applicability
of
section
7.
the
allen
bradley
case
where
it
involved
labor
unions
plus
some
incidence
of
the
antitrust
law
was
another
circumstance.
the
virginia
railway
system
federations
case
is
another
example.
so
we
say
that
there
is
an
area
where
injunctive
orders,
stays
and
so
on
can
be
issued
without
the
scope
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
either
section
4
or
section
7.
so,
we
say
that
the
decision
in
this
case
on
the
merits
and
the
--
in
our
favor
here
in
the
circuit
court
reversed
on
this
point
without
an
overruling
of
--
of
the
sinclair
case.
we
--
we
say
sinclair
should
be
limited
to
its
precise
facts.
it
should
be
limited
to
a
true
section
4
case.
it
should
not
be
extended.
the
section
7
application,
shouldn't
be
extended
as
judge
hayes
extended
it
to
cover
all
other
kinds
of
injunctions.
we
think
that
there
are
injunctions
in
proper
cases
where
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
no
application
because
it
doesn't
come
within
the
kind
of
things
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
designed
to
meet
and
--
and
to
cope
with.
now,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
turn
to
this
--
this
question
of
mootness
and
say
a
few
words
with
respect
to
that.
the
claim
of
mootness
that
we
have
here
was
created
by
the
union
right
at
the
eve
of
argument,
it
came
after
our
brief
was
filed.
the
member
of
the
union
had
filed
the
charge
against
the
foreman,
wrote
a
letter
or
signed
an
affidavit
for
his
union
and
said,
"i
withdraw
the
charge."
but
the
promise
there
doesn't
run
to
us.
we
have
no
way
of
enforcing
it.
we're
not
parties
to
the
union
proceedings.
if
they
violate
that
promise,
we
would
have
no
redress
to
enforce
it
except
by
going
back
to
the
federal
district
court
where
we
would
have,
you
know,
precisely
the
same
issue
that
we
had
here.
and
the
union
did
not
accept
the
propositions
on
the
merits
that
we
urge
here.
they
didn't
say
that
they're
not
going
to
discipline
the
foreman.
they
did
not
say
as
we
would
like
them
to
do
and
to
say
that
we
will
not
proceed
with
disciplinary
proceedings
against
the
foreman
until
the
issue
of
the
right
or
wrong
of
it
is
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
that
issue
was
still
alive
and
we're
still
very
much
in
dispute
over
the
--
the
real
issue
with
this
case,
the
applicability
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
so,
we
--
we
don't
have
the
classic
mootness
situation
where
there
are
in
any
adverse
parties.
we
have
very
adverse
parties.
we
--
we
have
a
very
strong
difference
of
opinion
on
the
real
issue
in
the
case
the
applicability
of
norris-laguardia.
and,
we
think
that
this
doctrine
of
mootness
is
one
that
should
be
applied
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
should
be
set
aside
and
not
applied
wherein
all
of
the
circumstances,
it's
not
warranted.
and
we
think
that
--
that
this
is
such
a
case.
we
think
this
case
is
very
much
like
the
yellow
transit
case
that
was
before
the
court
at
the
same
time
as
the
sinclair
case.
and
there,
the
injunction
that
had
been
granted
by
the
circuit
court
or
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
by
its
own
terms
would've
expired
with
the
running
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contained
the
no-strike
provision
which
was
being
enforced
by
the
--
the
order
there.
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
run
out
and
the
injunction
did
by
that
passage
of
time
expire
before
the
case
was
before
this
court.
and
instead
of
remanding
the
case
and
--
vacating
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
on
the
mootness
ground,
this
court
on
the
merits
reversed
the
decision
and
--
and
we
say
that
that
should
be
done
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
in
--
in
our
case
here?
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
yes.
what
happened
was
that,
after
our
brief
was
filed
here,
the
union
either
called
in
the
charging
party,
mr.
kelly,
and
kelly
signed
an
affidavit
which
is
in
the
union
suggestion
of
mootness
and
--
and
sort
of
announced
to
the
union
that,
"i
withdraw
my
charge
against
kelly".
and
we
say,
"well,
there's
nothing
to
stop
them
from
reinstating
it
if
--
if
mootness
is
declared
here
and
--
and
(inaudible)."
mr.
andrew
l.
hughes
thank
you.
