mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
respondents
would
like
to
bring
into
focus
the
particular
statutes
that
we
have
here
and
directly
relate
them
to
this
case,
because
we
feel
that
the
chronology
of
the
legislation
involved
is
particularly
important.
prior
to
1946,
all
pattern
royalties
paid
on
an
exclusive
license
were
taxed
as
ordinary
income.
in
1946,
the
tax
court
decided
the
myers
case
holding
that
where
you
had
an
exclusive
license
it
could
in
fact
be
a
sale,
and
if
so
if
it
were
a
capital
asset
the
royalties
that
you
received
in
the
ensuing
years
would
then
be
taxable
as
long-term
capital
gain.
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
his
opinion
and
published
his
acquiescence
and
so
for
a
period
of
four
years,
these
royalties
were
recognized
as
being
long-term
capital
gain.
that
was
true
as
to
the
casual
or
amateur
inventors,
but
of
course
it
was
not
true
as
to
professional
inventors,
because
their
patterns
were
considered
to
be
their
stock
in
trade,
and
they
were
selling
that
just
like
merchandise.
in
1950,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
reversed
himself
as
to
the
amateurs
and
said
that,
from
hereon
in
he
was
going
to
hold
that
all
such
pattern
royalties
were
ordinary
income.
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
indicated
the
courts
generally
did
not
agree
with
his
position
and
there
was
considerable
litigation
with
the
taxpayers
generally
winning.
the
next
important
step
was
the
enactment
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
in
which
congress
enacted
section
1235
and
i
believe
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
in
general,
injected
or
brought
into
the
code
a
whole
new
concept.
the
statutory
language
referred
to
a
transfer
of
all
substantial
rights
to
a
pattern.
it
didn't
go
into
title
or
other
previous
test
that
had
been
used.
the
result
of
this
was
to
give
taxpayers
for
1954
and
subsequent
years'
long-term
capital
gain
on
their
royalties
received
under
exclusive
license.
this
applied
as
to
professional
inventors.
it
applied
as
to
amateur
inventors
and
even
i
think
perhaps
additional
significance.
it
applied
where
the
patent
or
the
inventor
had
not
held
the
pattern
for
the
usual
six
months.
it
eliminated
the
holding
period
requirement
and
two
of
these
three
tests
were
entirely
new.
now
despite
the
enactment
of
section
1235
and
despite
the
courts'
decision
giving
taxpayers
the
capital
gain
treatment,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
published
a
ruling
to
the
effect,
that
as
for
the
four
years,
1950
to
1954,
he
was
going
to
continue
to
hold
that
these
royalties
were
ordinary
income.
this
was
the
situation
when
on
june
29th,
1956,
congress
enacted
section
117
(q),
which
is
practically
identical
in
language
to
section
1235
and
in
doing
so
congress
said
with
regard
to
the
applicability
of
the
statute,
this
sub-section
shall
apply
with
respect
to
any
amount
received
or
payment
made
pursuant
to
transfer
described
in
paragraph
1
in
any
taxable
year
beginning
after
may
31,
1950
regardless
of
the
taxable
year
in
which
such
transfer
occurred.
this
gave
professional
inventors
a
right
as
to
these
four
years
which
they
had
never
had
before.
it
also
gave
taxpayers
selling
their
patent
a
new
right
in
that
they
did
not
need
to
pay
any
attention
to
whether
they
had
held
the
patent
for
the
six
months
period.
now,
against
this
legislative,
judicial,
and
administrative
background,
i
think
should
be
considered
the
facts
in
the
case
of
mrs.
zacks.
in
the
first
place,
she
held
about
14
patents,
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
court
of
claims
made
no
finding
on
whether
she
was
a
professional
inventor
or
an
amateur
inventor,
because
first,
the
opinion
which
is
being
reviewed
here
was
based
on
the
pleadings,
and
secondly
the
case
was
disposed
on
the
merits
by
an
agreed
settlement
in
which
this
issue
was
not
stipulated.
we
strongly
contend
that
mrs.
zacks
was
a
professional
inventor.
this
is
not
questioned
in
the
government's
reply
brief.
in
fact
its
opening
sentence
says,
the
contention
of
the
respondent
are
adequately
dealt
within
our
principle
brief
and
then
the
government
goes
on
to
discuss
some
railroad
legislation.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
mrs.
zacks
should
clearly
be
considered
a
professional
inventor
and
as
the
court
has
noted
already
under
the
decided
cases
she
would
i
think
be
a
professional
inventor
with
this
number
of
patents,
i
found
no
cases
of
anybody
having
14
patents
that
was
held
to
be
an
amateur
if
they
were
all
in
the
same
related
field.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
finding,
no
sir.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it
didn't
come
before
the
court
because
of
the
opinion
was
on
the
pleadings
and
then
second
we
simply
stipulated
a
judgment
after
taking
testimony
and
having
a
hearing
of
parties
worked
out
a
an
agreed
judgment
in
the
case.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
not
your
honor.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
the
whole
case
is
premised
on
the
theory
that
she
was
an
amateur
and
this
was
clarifying
legislation.
the
heart
of
our
defense
is
that
she
was
not
an
amateur.
this
was
not
clarifying
legislation.
it
created
entirely
new
rights
in
her
connection
and
i
certainly
would
say
that
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
she
could
go
back
to
the
court
of
claims
for
a
decision
on
that
point.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
there
was
nothing
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
exactly.
as
i
understood
--
i
am
just
coming
to
that
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
and
the
year
here
we
have
is
1952.
she
received
some
$37,000
which
she
reported
as
ordinary
income.
we
have
stipulated
the
part
of
the
amount
was
paid
for
a
transfer
of
all
substantial
rights.
we
come
within
the
statute
on
that.
the
pleadings
admit
that
her
reporting
of
this
as
ordinary
income
was
in
accordance
with
the
then
administrative
rulings
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh
yes,
the
government
--
the
government
as
i
read
their
brief
wants
a
broad
rule
of
whether
we
made
new
law
or
clarified
law,
it's
ineffective
as
to
a
--
if
the
statute
is
wrong.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
but
as
to
an
amateur,
i
would
say
it
was
the
government
has
some
point
for
saying
it
is
clarifying
legislation
and
that
she
had
some
rights
that
she
could
have
pursued
and
i
think
that
was
the
situation
of
fifth
and
sixth
circuits,
like
when
they
looked
at
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
was
the
issue
and
they
were
all
bringing
that,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
on
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
can't
agree
with
you
your
honor
on
the
prospective
point,
because
of
the
language
of
the
applicability.
if
you
just
look
at
the
statute
congress
says
were
giving
professional
inventors
these
rights
as
of
may
31.
now
in
the
case
of
mrs.
zacks,
she
filed
her
return
on
april
15th,
1953.
the
statute
of
limitations
under
normal
situations
would
have
run
on
april
15th,
1956.
the
matter
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
if
she
was
a
professional
inventor
was
then
closed.
there
was
no
basis
i
think
for
anybody
filing
a
claim
for
refund.
there
was
nothing
that
the
taxpayer
could
do
to
protect
herself.
it
was
two-and-half
months
later
congress
changed
the
law
as
we
have
indicated.
at
that
time
the
taxpayer
filed
a
claim
for
refund
and
when
we
came
into
the
court
the
government
says
it's
too
late.
the
court
of
claims
disagreed
and
it
held
that
the
1956
enactment
giving
taxpayers
right
as
to
1952
would
have
been
an
ideal
gesture
if
the
statute
of
limitation
was
deemed
to
have
run
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
new
legislation.
after
taking
evidence
in
the
case,
the
parties
stipulated
a
judgment
for
the
taxpayers
of
$4600,
reserving
to
the
government
the
right
to
bring
the
case
to
this
court.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
filed
our
claim
within
the
two-year
period.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
two
years.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
because
i
think
that
the
--
we
think
the
theory
the
court
of
claims
is
right
in
that
the
change
in
the
statute
should
be
deemed
to
be
a
constructive
payment
and
then
you
then
apply
the
normal
statute
of
limitation
from
that
period
forward.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
exactly
and
that
--
the
court
of
claims
to
decide
cases
against
taxpayers
as
the
third
circuit
where
they
came
in
maybe
two
years
and
three
months
later
and
said,
well
no
we've
got
to
apply
the
statute
of
limitation
and
to
us
that's
a
logical,
bringing
together
the
two
statutes
would
bare
on
the
problem.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well
it's
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
but
it
was
not
an
overpayment,
it
became
an
overpayment
of
tax
at
the
time
congress
said
we
did
not
owe
this
money.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
it
didn't
become
a
payment.
but
it
became
i
think
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well
i
think
our
returns
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
pardon.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes
you
could
apply
the
three
year
from
a
return
or
the
six
year
of
the
general
statute
but
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
court
of
claims
applies
to
two
year
that
that
is
certainly.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
we
have
no
limitation.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
as
we
understand
the
position
of
a
government,
it
is
that
the
52
statute
was
only
intended
to
be
a
benefit
to
taxpayers
who
happen
to
be
litigating
this
issue
or
other
issues
or
who
by
some
fortuitous
circumstance
still
had
the
years
open.
they
might
have
had
other
issues
in
the
tax
court
or
wavers
might
have
been
given
because
of
audit
problem,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
117
(q)
indicating
any
such
limiting
content
at
all.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
correct.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes
and
they
probably
would
have
won
if
it
had
gone
on
to
litigation.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well
but
that
we
have
such
a
history
of
cases
on
this
and
the
government
has
cited
a
number
of
them
in
their
brief,
but
i
think
one
of
the
purposes
congress
had
was
to
set
this
problem
at
rest,
but
it
didn't
stop
there
because
it
brought
the
whole
1954
concept
into
the
39
code.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
we
do
--
there
is
some
talk
about
the
failure
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
follow
the
rulings
and
i
think
that
is
correct
to
say
that
they
have
this
in
mind.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
it
was
very
broad,
as
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
is
surprisingly
skimpy
in
that
they
haven't
discuss
really
what
they
intended
other
than
they
were
going
to
set
this
at
rest
and
they
didn't
like
the
action
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
in
his
electing
to
change
the
rule
as
they
existed
for
this
four
year
period.
the
–-
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
general
approach
of
the
government
by
looking
at
other
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
in
this
ten-year
period
to
the
extent
that,
that
might
be
at
all
pertinent.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
clear
pattern
evident
from
these
enactments.
in
some
of
them,
congress
said
to
taxpayers,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
benefit,
but
if
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
benefit
why
then
we
want
you
to
file
a
claim
for
refund
within
six
months
or
a
year
or
some
shorter
period.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
clearly
within
the
power
of
congress
to
shorten
that.
in
one
instance
congress
in
1951,
changed
the
law
to
give
taxpayers
a
retroactive
benefit
for
the
years
1941
to
1947.
in
other
words
they
went
back
ten
years,
but
as
here
they
said
nothing
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
problem
was
presented
to
congress
in
1955
and
congress
then
amended
the
original
amendment
to
provide
for
filing
claims
and
in
the
legislative
history
said
they
wanted
to
correct
what
was
apparently
an
oversight.
it
seems
logical
to
us
to
think
that
if
this
matter
had
been
presented
to
congress
specifically
that
was
regard
to
section
117
(q)
it
would
have
probably
corrected
what
it
may
have
considered
to
have
been
an
oversight
just
as
it
did
in
the
1951
act.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it's
covered
on
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
i
think
it
was
an
income
tax
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
for
the
benefit
of
serviceman
killed
an
action
i
believe.
it
was
some
type
of
a
remedy
that
they
waned
to
give
serviceman
or
their
beneficiaries.
we
submit
that
in
determining
the
issue
here,
the
court
should
look
to
section
117
(q)
alone
and
that
in
doing
so
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
statute
created
entirely
new
rights
as
to
professional
inventors
and
as
to
taxpayers
having
any
problem
with
the
holding
period
it
made
those
rights
expressly
applicable
to
the
year
1952,
which
was
otherwise
barred
here
and
the
same
would
be
true
of
1951,
and
that
under
well
established
rules
in
statutory
construction,
the
new
legalization
is
entitled
to
a
reasonable
construction
to
make
it
fully
effective.
we
believe
that
the
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
does
so
by
giving
full
effect
to
section
117
(q)
and
by
then
applying
the
statute
of
limitations
to
section
117
(q)
from
the
time
of
its
enactment
to
the
extent
that
this
constructive
payment
may
seen
like
somewhat
of
a
new
concept.
it
occurs
thus
that
it
just
the
reverse
of
the
coin
in
that
the
internal
revenue
service
is
often
collecting
taxes
on
theories
of
constructive
payment
and
it's
a
situation
where
perhaps
the
same
rules
should
work
both
ways.
finally,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
the
interpretation
of
this
problem
that
the
interpretation
should
be
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
because
of
his
position
in
the
matter.
we
submit
that
it
is
poor
tax
administration
for
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
tell
people
in
this
four-year
period
that
they
should
report
their
royalties
as
ordinary
income
and
then
after
congress
changes
the
law
to
come
into
this
court
and
in
substance
say
well
you
shouldn't
have
believed
what
i
told,
you
should
have
filed
claims
for
refund
even
though
as
we
say
from
a
point
of
view
of
a
profession
inventor
there
was
absolutely
no
basis
for
doing
so.
in
short,
this
taxpayer
should
not
be
penalized
for
having
followed
the
government's
instructions.
as
to
this
particular
statute
applied
to
this
particular
taxpayer,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
claims
was
entirely
correct
in
saying
that
the
entire
enactment
would
have
been
an
idle
gesture
if
congress
in
giving
this
benefit
for
1952
did
not
intend
taxpayers
to
get
benefit
because
of
the
previously
outstanding
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes
sir.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
not
as
to
this
year.
the
54
statute
moved
forward.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
it
didn't
--
the
54
statute
was
entirely
prospective
and
what
she
needed
was
something
to
open
the
door
to
her
for
the
year
52.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
