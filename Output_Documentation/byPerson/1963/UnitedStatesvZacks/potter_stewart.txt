that
had
to
do
with
the
state
acts,
was
it
not?
justice
potter

there
might
at
least
arguably
be
different
considerations
applicable
to
the
states
acts,
are
they
not,
in
view
of
the
general
policy
that
got
the
state
closed
up?
justice

now
the
state
eventually
has
distributed
and
then
closed
up,
letting
taxpayer,
he
is
not
alluding
and
presumably
he
is
always
perfectly
happy
to
get
a
little
refund
from
the

justice

it's
an
income
tax
case,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
might
be.
justice

with
respect
to
professional
matters,
there
was
no
controversy,
it
was
settled,
was
it
not
that
their
income
--
of
ordinary
income
in
any
event?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
still
ordinary
income.
justice
potter
stewart
in
light
of
the
last
case
we
had
if
you
are
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling

justice

--
that

so
that
it
would
have
been
a
futile
waste
of
money
for
anybody
to
spend
on
a
nickel
on
litigating
that
prior
to
1954,
am
i
correct?
justice

had
they

that
was
explicit
in
going
back
to
the
year
1950,
was
it
not?
justice

to
the
whole,
to
the
whole
enactment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
does
it
--
tell
me
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
option
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
change
the
law,
that
congress
had
to
act,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
a
clarifying,
it
was
changing
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
finding
on
that
there.

this

(inaudible)
see
them
out,
because
there
are
other
minor
controversies
to
settle
down.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
reese,
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
you
this.
i
gathered,
perhaps
erroneously,
from
the
amicus
plea
that
has
been
filed
by
the
nickel
plate
railroad.
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
more
so
by
the
fact
that
your
reply
brief
is
devoted
entirely
to
responding
to
that
amicus
brief
rather
than
to
the
case
presently
before
us.
that
perhaps
this
case
may
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
stalking
horse
so
to
speak
cover
that
situation,
that
different
statute
--
whether
or
nor
i'm
right
about
that
is
it
your
position
that
whatever
we
would
decide
in
this
case
would
be
dispositive
of
that
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
nonetheless
dispose
of
that
or
would?
