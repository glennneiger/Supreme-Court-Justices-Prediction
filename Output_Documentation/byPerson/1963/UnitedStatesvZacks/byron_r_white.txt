justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
just
to
be
interpreted
shortly
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
despair
the
difference
depending
on
what
(inaudible).
i
mean
if
you
are
right
obviously
that's
over,
but
if
you
are
wrong
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
by
shortening
it,
by
limiting
it
to
a
year
instead
of
tax
payer
having
a
longer
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
was
your
argument,
but
when
you
said
this
(inaudible)
but
to
me
i
think
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
also
saying
that
--
i
suppose
that
she
was
a
professional
inventor
and
there
were
no
professional
inventor
cases
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
if
the
statute
aimed
relief
only
for
professionals
that
it
would
give,
it
would
give
no
relief
whatsoever
unless
there
is
an
extension
in
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
amateurs
had
to
open
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
were
litigating
with
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
because
they
were
amateurs
and
not
professionals.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
complete
(inaudible)
can't
you
say
that
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
you
paid
before
is
that
overpayment.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
become
a
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
should
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
other
statute
of
limitations
compared
to
three
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
only
based
on
the
fictional
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
statute
would
have
settled
and
take
and
some
people
who
are
litigating
did
get
some
relief
as
a
result
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
some
people
with
open
ears
who
got
some
relief
out
of
this
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
people
claimed
they
were
amateurs
and
the
government
denied
it
and
they
were
litigating.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
they
might
have
lost
it.
