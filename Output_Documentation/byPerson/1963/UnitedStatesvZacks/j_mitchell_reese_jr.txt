mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
suit
for
a
refund
of
income
taxes
paid
for
the
year
1952.
the
only
issue
involved
here
is
whether
taxpayers
filed
a
timely
claim
for
refund.
taxpayer's
1952
income
tax
return
was
filed
in
april
of
1953.
the
tax
shown
thereon
to
due
was
paid
by
september
of
1953.
the
claim
for
refund,
on
which
this
suit
is
based,
was
filed
in
june
of
1958.
section
322
(b)
(1)
of
the
1939
code,
which
governs
here,
provides
that
to
be
timely,
a
claim
for
refund
must
be
filed
within
three
years
of
the
date
the
return
is
filed
or
within
two
years
of
the
date
the
tax
is
paid,
whichever
is
later.
section
7422
(a)
of
the
1954
code,
which
also
governs
here,
provides
that
no
suit
for
refund
maybe
brought
unless
a
timely
claim
for
refund
has
been
filed.
hence
at
the
outset,
if
the
provisions
of
section
322
(b)
(1)
are
given
their
normal
meaning
and
effect,
this
suit
is
clearly
barred.
however,
taxpayers
urge
and
the
court
below
held
in
this
case
that
an
enactment
of
section
117
(q)
of
the
1939
code
on
june
29,
1956,
created
by
implication
a
new
two-year
period
for
filing
claims
for
refund.
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
in
the
tobin
and
dempster
cases
held
to
the
contrary.
we
believe
the
decision
in
this
case
below
was
erroneous
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
we
don't
think
the
decision
is
supportable
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
statutes
involved.
section
117
(q)
provides
that
a
transfer
of
all
substantial
rights
to
a
patent
shall
be
treated
as
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
capital
asset
held
for
more
than
six
months,
regardless
of
the
method
of
payment
of
royalties,
pursuant
to
the
license
or
transfer
agreement.
that
section
117
(q)
provides
a
substantive
rule
of
law
which
was
--
which
then
became
a
part
of
the
1939
code.
however,
section
117
(q)
contains
no
reference
to
section
322
or
in
fact
to
any
other
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
therefore,
at
the
outset
our
view
is
that
once
section
117
(q)
is
a
part
of
the
code
naturally
it's
to
be
construed
in
conjunction
with
and
subject
to
the
limitations
of
all
other
sections
of
the
code.
one
such
section
is
of
course
section
322.
it's
not
the
only
one
that
might
affect
117
(q),
but
at
the
outset
we
feel
that
the
court
is
faced
with
a
proposition
that
there
is
really
nothing
it
can
construe,
there
is
no
language
that
suggests
in
anyway
that
117
(q)
is
meant
to
modify
322.
in
fact
we
believe
this
is
the
interpretation
that
congress
itself
intends
when
it
enacts
retroactive
tax
legislation.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
i
would
say
this,
your
honor
know,
if
it's
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
the
substance
of
it,
if
it
says
nothing
about
limitations
or
any
other
section.
now
in
the
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
it's
unequal
treatment
in
the
sense
that
congress
is
responding
i
think
to
the
claim
that
is
being
made
on
it,
that
is
it's
responding
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
i
think
on
the
basis
of
what
congress
has
done
that's
the
only
inference
that
can
be
made,
yes
i
do
think
that.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes
i
say
it
for
that
reason.
i
think
for
example
in
appendix
c
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
approximately
47
retroactive
measures
enacted
in
the
period
1953
to
1962.
now
in
30
of
those
measures,
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
this
problem.
congress
has
specifically
provided
an
extension
of
varying
periods.
sometimes
it's
six
months
from
the
date
of
enactment,
sometimes
it's
a
year
from
the
date
of
enactment,
in
several
cases
it's
60
days.
there
are
a
variety
of
solutions
that
congress
has
adopted
to
solve
this
problem.
i
think
if
the
theory
of
the
court
below
were
correct,
every
one
of
those
30
measures
would
have
been
unnecessary
because
the
theory
of
the
court
below
is
that
when
congress
says
nothing,
if
it
makes
the
effective
date
applicable
retroactively,
it
must
intend
to
create
a
new
two-year
period.
now
in
fact
the
result
would
be
that
in
these
30
cases
or
at
least
in
most
of
the
30
cases
where
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
a
problem
and
has
specifically
indicated
at
least
in
a
number
of
them
and
it's
--
that
it
intends
to
reopen
or
extend
the
limitations
period,
it
would
actually
be
shortening
the
period
because
if
it
said
nothing,
two
years
would
be
allowed.
so
that
by
providing
an
example,
an
additional
six
months,
it's
actually
reducing
by
a
year-and-a-half,
the
period
otherwise
allowed.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
it's
not
even
conceivable,
but
i
think
it's
contrary
to
legislative
history
of
the
acts
in
which
it
has
extended
the
period
and
i
think,
let
me
just
point
out
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
yes,
i
say,
in
the
first
place
it's
to
be
in
inferred
from
what
i've
just
said.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes
there
has,
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
a
number
of
occasions
in
which
the
legislative
history
specifically
states
this.
let
me
just
pick
one
example.
on
page
21
of
our
brief
we
have
dealt
with
a
number
of
these
statutes,
the
first
one
is
section
1
of
the
act
of
august
9,
1955.
now
this
act
was
made
retroactive
to
taxable
years
beginning
after
december
31,
1946.
it
made
a
clear
change
in
law.
it
applied
to
years
normally
barred
on
the
date
of
enactment.
on
page
22,
we
have
quoted
a
portion
of
the
both
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report
in
which
congress
said,
this
provision
applies
to
all
taxable
years
beginning
after
december
31,
1946
to
which
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
applies.
however,
the
bill
does
not
open
up
years
with
respect
to
which
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
i
think
the,
i
think
the
difficulty
without
interpretation
is
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute
in
this
act
of
august
9,
congress
did
exactly,
precisely
what
it
did
in
section
117
(q).
the
statutory
language
is
substantially
the
same.
we
have
cited
others.
here
is
a
statement
by
senator
byrd,
chairman
of
finance
committee
in
connection
with
another
retroactive
amendment
enacted
in
1958.
the
same
thing
holds
true.
it
was
applicable
to
years
normally
barred,
nothing
was
said
about
limitations.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
i
don't
know,
i
confess
i
don't
follow
the
distinction
right.
perhaps
there
could
be
one,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
that's
true,
i
suppose
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
theory
of
this
case
would
have
applied
if
mrs.
zacks
had
died.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes.
well
that's
certainly
a
possible
distinction.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes,
yes.
117
(q)
was
enacted,
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
primarily
to
deal
with
the
problem
created
by
the
commissioner's
ruling
in
1950.
the
background
is
this.
in
1946,
the
tax
court
decided
the
myers'
case
in
which
it
held
that
a
transfer
of
patent
rights
could
qualify
for
capital
gains
treatment
even
though
royalty
is
to
be
paid
under
the
license.
it
depended
on
the
productivity
of
the
patent,
that
is
the
royalties
for
example
5%
of
the
sales
price
of
each
article
incorporating
the
patent.
at
first
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
this
decision.
early
in
1950,
the
commissioner
withdrew
his
acquiescence,
substituted
a
non-
acquiescence
and
held
that
for
taxable
years
beginning
after
may
31,
1950,
a
transfer
would
not
be
treated
as
a
sale
or
exchange
if
the
royalty
is
depended
on
the
productivity
or
generally
i
think
the
profitability
of
the
patent.
commissioner's
position
was
that
in
this
situation
the
owner
of
the
patent
had
retained
what
was
in
effect
a
substantial
right
that
is
the
right
to
profit
if
the
patent
was
profitable.
now
the
courts
almost
uniformly
rejected
the
position
of
the
commissioner.
it
almost
uniformly
followed
the
myers'
decision.
in
1954,
congress
settled
the
matter
prospectively
in
section
1235.
in
1956
--
well,
in
1955
the
commissioner
ruled
again
that
he
would
continue
to
apply
his
rule
to
years
governed
by
the
1939
code.
in
1956,
congress
enacted
section
117
(q).
now,
it
in
doing
so,
it
followed
substantially
the
language
of
section
1235.
the
committee
reports
and
the
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
explaining
the
purpose
that
indicate
that
the
primary
purpose
was
to
settle
the
controversy
created
by
this
1950
ruling
and
as
congressman
cooper
said
in
introducing
this
bill
in
the
house,
this
is
set
out
on
page
3,
4
of
our
brief,
he
said
that
he
outlined
very
briefly
what
i
have
just
told
you
about
the
commissioner's
position,
then
he
said
h.r.
6143
eliminates
the
necessity
for
such
litigation,
that
is
the
litigation
caused
by
the
position
taken
by
the
commissioner.
so
that
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
primary
purpose
was
to
settle
this
controversy.
now
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
correct,
even
assuming
there
was
a
sale
or
exchange,
which
was
this
problem
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
it
was
still
ordinary
income.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
true,
yes.
now
i
don't
think
it
follows
from
that,
if
i
may
--
perhaps
i
am
anticipating
a
question,
but
i
think
the
reasoning
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
taxpayers
have
asserted
that
mrs.
zacks
was
a
professional.
i
think
the
reasoning
they
assert
follows
from
this
is
that
since
117
(q)
by
its
substantive
terms
â€“
well,
let
me
put
it
in
another
way.
since
117
(q)
intended
to
provide
relief
for
professionals,
for
taxable
years
as
far
back
as
1950
and
since
no
professional
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
filing
a
claim,
congress
must
have
intended
to
reopen
the
period.
i
think
the
trouble
with
the
argument
is
that
it
in
effect
assumes
the
answer,
that
is,
it
assumes
congress
in
enacting
117
(q)
was
intending
to
give
relief
to
professionals
to
years
as
far
back
as
1950.
well,
no
it
doesn't.
what
it
says
is
by
its
substantive
terms
a
professional
is
entitled
to
relief
under
117
(q),
but
the
only
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
and
it
was
explicit
in
going
back
to
the
year
1950
that
date
being
relevant,
not
to
the
professional
question,
but
to
the
amateur
question.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
so,
because
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
alright,
the
non-acquiescence
in
1950
relating
to
what
i
refer
to
as
the
sale
or
exchange
question,
said
that
for
taxable
years
beginning
after
may
31,
1950
a
transfer
will
not
be
treated
as
a
sale
or
exchange
gift
if
royalty
is
depended
on
productivity.
now,
when
congress
enacted
117(q),
it
made
it
effective
for
taxable
years
beginning
after
may
31,
1950
so
that
this
is
precisely
--
fits
the
date
of
the
non-acquiescence.
now
if
it
had
been
concerned
with
professionals,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
picked
that
date,
i
don't
think
that
date
makes
any
sense
because
prior
to
1950,
a
professional
was
not
entailed
to
relief.
subsequent
to
1950,
a
professional
was
not
entailed
to
relief.
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
practical
answer
as
to
the
reason
why
congress
didn't
reopen
barred
years
is
that
the
people
it
was
concerned
with
didn't
need
to
have
their
years
reopened.
anybody
who
is
litigating
the
question
obviously
had
a
time
in
claim
pending
or
at
least
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
no
because,
the
courts
were
holding
in
effect
that
royalty
paid
to
a
professional
was
ordinary
income.
so
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
â€“
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes.
if
congress
wanted
to
change
the
law
retroactively,
they
had
to
act.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
it
was
changing
it.
now
in
section
1235
of
course,
congress
did
--
in
enacting
1235
congress
was
concerned
as
the
legislative
history
shows
with
three
problems.
one
was
the
so
called
sale
or
exchange
problem.
one
was
the
definition
of
a
capital
asset
problem
that's
the
professional
problem,
and
the
third
was
the
holding
period.
now
in
enacting
1235,
congress
said
and
the
committee
reports
that
we
put
in
our
brief
accompanying
1235
showed
that
it
meant
to
make
all
three
changes.
however,
when
it
enacted
117
(q),
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
shows
congress
was
concerned
with
only
one
of
those
three
and
the
retroactive
application
was
concerned
with
only
one.
now
i
would
say
this,
the
reasons
i
have
given
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
of
117
(q)
i
think
explain
or
at
least
help
to
explain
why
congress
didn't
feel
it
was
necessary
to
reopen
barred
years.
i
don't
think
our
interpretation
depends
on
that.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
from
first
just
from
the
face
of
the
statute
and
second
from
the
inference
and
explicit
statements
as
to
what
congress
intends,
but
it
did
not
intend
to
reopen
barred
years,
that
it
did
not
intend
the
language
it
used
to
have
that
affect.
now
i
think
one
thing
that
makes
this
absolutely
certain
is
the
comparison
of
sections
1
and
2
of
the
act
of
june
29.
section
1
added,
section
117
(q),
to
the
1939
code.
section
2
added
an
amendment
to
section
106
of
the
1939
code.
as
they
passed
the
senate,
both
these
provisions
were
retroactive,
that
is
both
applied
to
years
normally
barred.
neither
contained
any
reference
to
the
operation
of
any
other
law
or
rule
of
law.
in
conference,
section
2
was
amended
to
add
a
provision
which
in
substance
states
that
if
a
refund
pursuant
to
its
terms
is
barred
on
the
date
of
enactment
not
withstanding
the
operation
of
any
other
law
or
rule
of
law,
well,
let
me
be
a
little
more
accurate
about
it.
what
it
actually
says
is,
section
2
will
apply
notwithstanding
the
operation
of
any
other
law
or
rule
of
law
if
a
claim
for
refund
is
filed
within
one
year
after
the
date
of
enactment.
so
in
section
2
congress
specifically
dealt
with
the
problem
that's
faced
here,
in
section
one
it
said
nothing,
i
don't
see
how
any
other
inference
is
possible.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
they
are
quite
unrelated.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
section
s,
dealt
with
actually
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
dealt
with
a
problem
that
one
taxpayer
had,
but
it
provided
that
in
cases
where
a
taxpayer
had
a
claim
against
the
government
or
payment
or
construction
of
facilities
for
the
armed
forces
and
where
the
payment
was
not
made
within
five
years
after
completion
of
construction.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes,
you
are
right,
but
i
think
in
terms
of
interpretation
as
they
came
out
of
the
senate
they
both
had
retroactive
effect
and
neither
operated
to
reopen
the
barred
years
or
affect
any
other
law
or
rule
of
law.
as
they
were
ultimately
passed,
section
1
was
silent
on
this
question,
section
2
specifically
lifted
the
bar
of
other
laws
or
rules
of
law.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
no
it
just,
just
said
that
this
was
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
i
don't,
i
don't
think
so,
no
because
if,
well
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
the
actual
reason
that
it
was
necessary
in
section
2
to
lift
the
bar
of
other
laws
or
rules
of
law
was
that
the
taxpayer
for
whose
benefited
was
enacted
had
already
litigated
his
case
and
lost.
now
i
think
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
my
suggestion
is,
there
would
have
been
no
extension
in
either.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
there
was
provision.
both
just
said
for
example
section
1
said
this
applies
to
taxable
years,
beginning
after
may
31,
1950.
section
2
said,
this
applies
to
taxable
years
beginning
after
december
31,
1948,
but
that's
all
they
said.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
they
were
both
silent
on
what
we
refer
to
as
the
limitation
question,
then
as
they
were
finally
enacted
section
specifically
dealt
with
the
problem
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
i
could
honestly
say
that's
entirely
impossible
if
you
are
just
looking
at
that
one
section.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way,
perhaps
our
interpretation
depends
also
on
considering
this
in
conjunction
with
the
pattern
of
legislation
over
the
last
10
years.
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
add
that.
yes.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
i
could
not
say,
well
i
am
almost
certain
that
they
were,
that
they
were
amateurs,
because
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right,
that's
right.
i
believe
that
covers
what
i
have
to
say,
i'd
like
to
save
whatever
remaining
time
i
have.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
in
connection
with
this
survey
of
legislation
we've
done
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
provision
that
appears
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
this
is
a
statement
made
by
the
chairman
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
congressman
mills
in
connection
with
1960
amendment,
which
was
passed
by
both
houses.
it
was
subsequently
vetoed
by
the
president,
but
this
is
what
he
said.
the
amendments
contained
in
hr
6482
will
apply
to
calendar
years
beginning
after
1950.
since
the
effective
date
provision
does
not
refer
to
a
period
of
limitations
for
claiming
credit
or
refund
no
refunds
or
credits
will
be
allowed
where
the
calendar
year
involved
is
closed
by
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
this
is
a
general
principle
and
we
submit
that
this
principle
will
become
absolutely
clear
to
anyone
who
reads
all
these
47
measures
that
we've
set
out.
in
isolation
it's
hard
to
convey
this,
i
think,
in
oral
argument,
but,
i
think,
a
reading
of
all
these
statutes,
a
reading
of
the
30
statutes
in
which
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
this
problem
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
itself
is
applying
the
rule
that
we
say
should
be
applied
here.
now,
that
being
true
i
don't
think
a
court
can
really
go
beyond
that.
i
think
what
the
court
has
to
look
for
is
the
congressional
intent
or
the
--
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
no,
we
say
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
if
we
are
correct
that
congress
in
enacting
117
(q)
did
not
intend
to
reopen
barred
years
for
amateurs,
for
example,
clearly
they
didn't
intend
to
reopen
barred
years
for
professionals,
because
as
the
legislative
history
shows
i
don't
think
congress
was
concerned
or
perhaps
only
interdentally
concerned
with
the
professional
problem.
the
amateur
problem
was
what
they
were
directing
their
attention
to.
i
think
the
only
reason
that
professionals,
in
fact,
are
covered
by
this
legislation
is
that
the
legislative
solution
congress
adopted
was
to
in
corporate
in
117
(q)
almost
verbatim
the
language
of
section
1235.
this
was
the
1954
code
prospective
provision.
now,
it
was
concerned
with
three
problems.
as
i
said
before,
117
(q)
was
concerned
with
only
one
of
those
three,
but
it
happened
to
just
adopt
the
language
so
that
in
substantive
terms
it
actually
covers
all
three,
but
in
terms
of
retroactive
effect,
it
was
only
directed,
i
think,
at
one
of
them.
i'd
just
like
to
say
one
other
thing
about
the
question
whether
congress
thought
it
was
extending
or
restricting
the
law
otherwise
applicable
when
it
adopted
these
provisions.
on
pages
27
to
32
of
our
brief,
we've
set
out
a
number
of
statutes
in
which
the
legislative
history
makes
it
perfectly
clear,
i
think,
that
congress
thought
it
was
providing
relief
otherwise
barred
when
it
added
these
express
provisions
reopening
barred
years.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes,
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
precisely.
i
believe
that's
all
i
have.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
will
be.
i
think
the
narrowest
ground
that
this
court
could
possible
put
this
decision
on
would
control
that
case.
mr.
j.
mitchell
reese,
jr.
yes
that
is
our
position.
thank
you.
