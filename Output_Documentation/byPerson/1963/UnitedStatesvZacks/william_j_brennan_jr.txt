justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
you
say
this
because
in
some
instances
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
the
problem
of
filling
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
as
a
general
matter
starts
with
a
presumption
that
if
it
says
nothing,
there
is
to
be
no
extension
of
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
mean
is
there
anything
explicit
said
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
may
only
mean
that
in
this
instance
they
did
not
open
up
years
with
respect
to
which
the
statute
of
limitation
would
run,
not
that
generally
but
they
said
nothing,
they
might
open
up
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
matter
of
one
and
two,
quite
unrelated
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what,
what
is
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
conference
of
court
made
no
comment
on
the
significance
of
the
reception
speaking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
they
went
to
conference,
sections
1
and
2
went
to
conference
--
your
suggestion
is
that
there
would
have
been
an
extension
for
the
full
two-year
period
both
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
there
had
been
a
provision
as
to
1
and
2
was,
it
went
to
conference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
that
whether
she
--
i
thought
the
whole
case
was
here
on
the
premise
that
she
was
a
professional
and
the
problem
is
whether
this
statute
is
retroactively
applicable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
about
it,
i'm
still
little
puzzled
about
this?
why
we
got
the
case
at
all
unless
it's
here
on
the
premise
that
she's
a
professional
inventor?
this
limitations
point
doesn't
arise
except
in
that
connection,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
she
were
an
amateur
inventor,
would
this
statute
abide
her?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
brought
that
action,
i
understand,
just
within
two
years
after,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
do
you
think
under
your
view
you
could
have
filed
the
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
two
years?
why
not
forever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
on
the
premise
that
this
creates
the
right
not
theretofore
exists?
