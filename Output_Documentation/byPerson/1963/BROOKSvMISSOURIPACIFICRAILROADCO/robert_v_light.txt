mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
like
tilton
that
came
here
through
the
eighth
circuit.
there
are
a
number
of
factual
distinctions
between
this
case
and
tilton.
in
the
first
instance,
mr.
brooks
was
engaged
in
a
traditional
type
of
apprenticeship,
a
formalized
traditional
arrangement
requiring
coincidentally,
1040
days
as
did
the
--
which
was
the
day
requirement
in
tilton.
however,
it's
quite
clear
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
training
period,
not
simply
a
work
period.
this
is
made
clear
by
the
correspondence
course
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
yesterday.
mr.
robert
v.
light
a
journeyman
machinist
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
he
works
under
the
journey
--
you
mean
when
he's
on
the
job
working
as
a
machinist
apprentice?
mr.
robert
v.
light
during
the
training
period,
he
works
under
the
supervision
of
the
journeyman
machinist
performing
machinist
type
of
work
in
order
to
qualify
to
ultimately
become
a
journeyman
machinist.
but
it
all
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
record
is
unclear
on
that,
i'm
--
i'm
certain
they
have
apprentices
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
frankly
that
is
not
in
the
record
--
that
was
not
developed,
unlike
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
--
the
point
that
this
is
a
training
period?
mr.
robert
v.
light
well
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well
really,
the
only
thing
in
the
record
on
that,
your
honor
is
that
the
correspondence
course
which
is
a
two
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
railroad
company
through
its
apprentice
instructor
who
testified
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
again
was
not
developed
in
the
trial
court,
your
honor
but
he
does
testify
and
as
i
say,
the
only
thing
in
the
record
on
that
point,
that
if
the
apprentice
machinist
gets
as
much
as
three
months
behind
and
his
correspondence
course
is
either
two
lessons
per
month
by
correspondence,
that
he's
in
a
subject
to
dismissal
from
the
apprenticeship.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
i
think
we
must
infer
that
there
are
some
--
some
skill
and
some
learning
involved
in
--
in
--
either
that's
implied
from
the
course
itself,
the
course
--
correspondence
course
of
study.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
the
standard
of
sufficient
proficiency
be
retained
in
the
apprenticeship.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
perhaps
we
--
we
find
the
--
the
criteria
that
your
honor
is
searching
for
in
the
written
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
it
pertains
to
apprentices.
there's
a
provision
in
there
that
during
the
first
period
which
happen
to
be
130
days
in
apprenticeships,
divided
into
eight
periods,
that
if
he
does
not
show
proficiency
to
become
an
apprentice
or
to
become
a
--
a
journeyman
that
he
would
be
dismissed,
that
he
will
not
be
retained.
that's
what
the
labor
organization
and
the
railroad
company
have
agreed
that
he
will
not
be
retained
if
during
the
first
period,
he
doesn't
demonstrate
proficiency,
a
positive
standard.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
another
significant
factor
in
this
case
that
--
that
distinguishes
it
from
tilton,
argued
yesterday.
the
apprentice
machinist
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case,
on
completing
his
1040
days,
does
not
thereby
acquire,
on
the
1040th
day
or
the
1041st
day,
seniority
as
a
journeyman.
in
tilton,
the
upgraded
carmen
helpers
did
acquire
or
make
it
on
finishing
their
1040th
day
and
on
making
the
election
to
forfeit
their
helper
seniority,
they
did
then
acquire
seniority
on
the
carman
--
journeymen
carmen's
seniority
roster.
he
does
not,
as
an
apprentice.
he
has
no
right
to
an
employment
by
the
railroad
company.
the
practical
affect
to
that
is
that
if
there
were
four
carmen
--
upgraded
carmen
helpers
who
had
finished
their
1040
days
and
one
vacancy
for
a
carman,
then
the
one
that
would
get
it
would
be
the
one
that
first
finished
his
1040
days.
and
contemporaneously,
elected
the
forfeiters
helper
seniority
and
at
that
time,
he
went
on
the
carmen's
roster.
however,
in
this
case,
if
there
were
four
apprentices
who
had
competed
and
one
vacancy
for
an
--
for
a
journeyman
machinist,
the
one
that
would
get
it
is
the
one
that
the
railroad
company
would
select
from
among
the
four
regardless
of
whether
he
had
finished
the
day
before
or
year
before
because
he
has
no
seniority
whatever
on
the
journeymen's
seniority
roster
until
he's
employed
by
the
railroad
company.
selected
and
employed
and
works
his
first
day
and
that's
the
day
that
he
establishes
on
that
roster.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
i
believe
that
rule
is
at
page
62
of
the
record,
rule
37
(e)
which
states,
“if
an
apprentice
is
retained
--
if
an
apprentice
is
retained
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
in
service.”
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
believe
mr.
justice
goldberg,
subject
to
mr.
heymann's
correcting
me
when
he
makes
his
rebuttal
that
perhaps
that
is
a
--
a
misprint
and
it
should
read
rule
37.
now
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir,
it's
rule
37
(e).
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
which
of
course
were
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
it
must
accept
them.
they
were
based
on
substantial
evidence,
were
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
shortage
of
journeymen
mechanics
at
the
north
little
rock
shops
during
this
november
period
that
we
--
were
talking
about
and
i'll
talk
about
a
little
bit
more
in
a
moment.
and
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
apprentices
that
presented
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
--
that
their
--
that
whatever
discretion
management
had
would've
been
readily
--
readily
exercised.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
was
the
situation
it
found
as
the
fact
existed
in
north
little
rock
at
that
time.
now,
i'll
--
i
do
not
say
that
the
trial
--
in
fact,
i
contest
that
trial
court's
conclusion
of
law
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
that
this
would
make
it
automatic
within
mckinney
is
--
is
correct,
that
i
think
that
it's
not.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
wouldn't
--
it
would
not
disturb
my
argument
at
all.
there
is
no
immediate
prospect
of
injuring
--
a
monetary
injury
at
railroad
company.
it
doesn't
cost
the
railroad
company
anymore
to
employ
mr.
brooks
than
it
--
than
it
would
to
employ
whoever
is
now
ahead
of
him
on
the
seniority
roster
that
he
would
jump
if
he's
successful
in
this
case.
there
is
a
possibility
that
i
haven't
researched
and
reached
the
point
of
the
finding
--
searched
and
researched
it
that
we
would
have
claims
from
persons
like
mr.
brooks
if
--
if
this
case
is
reversed,
saying,
“you
had
me
in
the
wrong
place
on
your
seniority
roster
all
these
years,
as
the
consequence,
i
was
laid
off
when
i
should
not
have
been
and
you
owe
me
a
back
pay
for
that.”
the
other
disadvantages
that
a
man
could
sustain
as
a
result
of
being
on
the
wrong
place
in
the
seniority
roster,
it'd
be
hard
to
measure
the
monetary
damage
but
he
could've
been
in
a
better
job
that
might've
had
either
more
convenient
hours
as
a
result
of
his
seniority
or
might've
produced
more
overtime
pay
than
--
than
the
job
he
was
able
to
hold
because
of
his
relative
position
on
the
seniority
roster.
really,
i'm
here
and
the
railroad
company
is
here
and
in
more
or
less,
a
representative
capacity
for
the
railroad
brotherhood,
that's
an
unusual
position
to
be
in
but
the
labor
organization
of
which
the
petitioner
is
a
member,
the
af
--
afl
railway
employees
department
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
here
in
support
of
the
position
that
--
that
i
present.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
i
don't
quite
follow
you
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
and
i
don't
recall
that
is
in
either
case,
nor
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
--
any
suggestion
to
that
effect
here.
if
--
if
i'm
following
you
on
what
sort
of
mistake
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
government
emphasizes
in
its
brief
that
brooks
had
a
contract
right
to
complete
his
apprenticeship
once
he
had
gotten
into
it
and
once
he
got
over
the
first
130
days
which
was
more
or
less
a
probationary
or
trial
period.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
that
is
not
what
it
--
it
might
imply,
his
contract
right
to
complete
the
apprenticeship.
he
was
not
employed
for
a
term
of
days
or
months
adding
up
to
1040
year
--
1040
days.
he
was
employed
to
complete
his
apprenticeship
specifically
provided
in
the
agreement
that
he
could
be
discharged
for
cause
during
the
entirety
of
the
1040
days
and
certainly,
he
was
subject
to
layoffs,
which
an
employee
contracted
to
work
for
a
--
a
period
of
time
would
not
be.
this
is
best
evidence
by
what
happened
to
mr.
brooks
in
this
case.
he
came
back
from
the
middle
of
his
service
to
monroe
and
resumed
his
apprenticeship.
and
thereafter,
the
--
there
was
a
change
and
the
work
done
at
monroe
and
he
was
laid
off.
the
machinist
work
was
no
longer
available
to
him
as
an
apprentice
there.
so
he
had
no
right
to
continue
his
employment
as
such.
now,
he
was
able
to
some
several
months
later,
to
find
a
vacancy
in
the
st.
louis
shops
of
the
railroad
company
and
transferred
there
in
response
to
a
system
call.
but
his
so-called
right
to
complete
the
employmentship
--
to
--
the
employment
to
the
extent
that
it
is
relevant
isn't
really
what
it
implies.
that
is,
that
he
was
employed
subject
to
the
layoff
if
--
if
the
work
diminished
and
subject
to
a
discharge
for
cause.
there
is
a
stipulation
in
this
case
that
i
want
to
discuss
to
a
certain
extent.
november
3,
1955
was
the
date
that
mr.
heymann
has
referred
to
that
all
parties
agreed
that
--
and
to
use
his
expression
“that
he
would
have
completed
his
apprenticeship
but
for
the
military
interruption.”
what
that
was,
that
was
not
intended
as
a
stipulation
to
make
this
ideal
type
of
case
that
is
an
agreement
that
the
1040
days
were
simply
a
work
period
and
was
not
a
training
period.
it
was
not
intended
to
--
to
take
it
out
of
the
--
or
to
resolve
the
uncertainties,
a
non-automatic
type
of
--
of
criteria
that
was
laid
down
in
mckinney.
in
1945,
the
railroad
company
and
the
railroad
brotherhood
entered
into
an
agreement
which
is
referred
to
in
this
record
as
the
memorandum
of
understanding
of
1945,
which
provided
the
apprentices
more.
the
apprentices,
who
had
been
employed
by
the
railroad
company
and
then
went
to
service
during
the
course
of
their
apprenticeship,
went
to
the
military
service.
it
provided
them
more
than
the
act
provided.
it
provided
that
upon
return
and
completion
of
their
apprenticeship
with
the
railroad
company
after
the
military
service,
their
seniority
as
journeymen
would
be
fixed
as
of
the
date
they
would
have
completed
their
apprenticeship
but
for
the
military
interruption.
now,
having
made
that
provision
and
having
apprentices
now
returning
in
the
1940s
from
the
military
service
and
completing
their
apprenticeship,
it
was
necessary
for
these
contracting
parties,
the
railroad
company
and
the
brotherhood
to
device
a
method
of
computation
under
that
contract
by
which
they
would
assign
those
seniority
dates
to
these
apprentices.
and
it
is
that
method
of
computation
by
which
the
november
3,
1955
date
is
reached.
that
is
we
--
we
do
not
agree
by
saying
that
he
would
have
finished
on
november
3,
1955.
that
all
of
these
uncertainties
that
may
have
kept
him
from
finishing
are
resolved,
are
no
longer
in
the
case.
all
we
say
and
it's
quite
clear
in
the
parts
of
the
record
that
i've
quoted
in
the
brief
that
operating
under
the
memorandum
of
understanding
on
1945
and
computing
the
time
as
all
such
computations
have
been
made,
the
date
of
november
3,
1955
is
developed.
in
fact,
the
railroad
company
contends
and
concedes
that
in
this
case,
he's
entitled
to
that
date
retroactive
seniority
at
monroe,
louisiana
under
the
agreement,
without
reference
to
any
right
he
acquires
under
the
act.
he
doesn't
want
the
seniority
at
monroe
and
has
rejected
it
because
it's
of
little
practical
value
to
have
seniority
there
where
the
work
is
not
done
or
there's
insufficient
work
done
for
him
to
be
employed.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
made
reference
to
that
stipulation
and
--
and
concurred
in
what
i've
just
said
that
it
was
clearly
made
with
the
reservation
that
it
was
a
method
of
computation,
not
a
stipulation
that
he
would
have
in
fact,
finished
on
that
date
had
he
not
had
to
go
to
the
military
service.
i
find
no
difficulty
with
either
mckinney
or
diehl.
in
this
case,
the
mckinney
rule
is
that
the
act
reserves
for
the
returning
veteran
what
he
automatically,
as
a
matter
of
right
and
that
mr.
heymann
says
that
it
certainly
must
be
contact
right.
i
don't
know
where
else
he
would
acquire
such
right.
it
preserves
those
things
he
automatically,
as
a
matter
of
right
would've
acquired
had
he
remained
out
of
the
military
service
and
in
the
employment.
diehl
involved
in
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
by
the
veteran
that
he
would
have
in
fact
finished
the
apprenticeship
on
such
and
such
a
date.
and
the
case
being
decided
on
motion
in
the
lower
court,
that
must
be
taken
as
admitted
which
we
don't
have
here.
the
government
argues,
i
think,
that
this
court
should
overrule
mckinney.
at
page
36
of
the
government's
brief,
it
argues
that
what
it
is
advocating
for
a
veteran,
is
that
he'd
be
able
to
have
under
the
act,
all
of
those
benefits
proved
with
that
degree
of
certainty,
normally
requisite
to
the
established
legal
rights.
that
he
probably
would've
gotten
had
he
remained
in
the
employment
instead
to
go
in
the
military
service.
i
do
not
know
what
the
reference
or
the
phrase
with
that
degree
of
certainty
--
showed
with
that
degree
certainty,
normally
requisite
to
establish
legal
rights.
i
don't
know
what
that
could
mean
other
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which
is
the
usual
standard
by
which
legal
rights
are
established
on
a
civil
case.
now
in
mckinney,
this
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
a
veteran
was
entitled
under
the
act
to
those
things
that
it's
highly
probable
that
he
would
have
acquired
had
he
stayed
in
the
employment.
it
specifically
rejected
that
and
adopted
the
automatic
--
as
a
matter
of
contact
right
standard.
if
the
court
concurred
in
the
government's
approach
in
this
case,
it
would
not
only
go
back
to
approving
the
highly
probable
standard
but
it
would
be
down
to
a
point
of
a
preponderance
of
the
probabilities
because
that's
all
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is.
the
government
is
really
asking
the
court
to
go
much
further
back
than
even
the
mckinney
case.
i
think
that
the
position
taken
by
the
railroad
brotherhood
in
their
amicus
brief
is
deserving
of
consideration.
they
point
out
that
this
law
has
been
a
fertile
breeding
ground
for
litigation
from
the
time
of
its
original
enactment.
and
that
the
diehl
case
didn't
resolve
that
but
perhaps
prompted
additional
litigation,
has
been
a
great
deal
since
diehl,
since
this
court
did
dispose
of
diehl
without
an
opinion.
but
with
the
standards
laid
down
in
mckinney
and
they're
clear
standards,
they're
standards
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
no
difficulty
with.
i
think
that
courts
of
appeal
are
not
in
conflict
as
to
the
application
of
the
mckinney
standards.
that
will
resolve
the
litigation
that
we've
had
so
long
for
20
years
which
is
expensive
as
pointed
out
by
the
brotherhood
and
which
engenders
unhappiness
in
the
entire
industry
and
all
the
industries
affected
by
this,
by
constant
litigation
among
fellow
workers
seeking
to
obtain
relative
benefits
to
the
relative
detriment
of
their
fellow
workers.
the
transfer
feature
which
is
novel
in
this
case,
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
veteran
employee
seeks
assignment
of
a
seniority
day,
a
retroactive
seniority
day,
had
a
place
other
than
that
at
which
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
assign
it.
the
railroad
industry
has
traditionally
had
a
system
of
point
seniority
that
is
an
apprentice
or
a
journeyman
at
monroe,
louisiana
shops,
has
no
seniority
at
north
little
rock
shops
for
the
same
railroad
company
or
the
st.
louis
shops.
and
if
he
transfers
from
monroe
as
a
journeyman,
to
north
little
rock,
he
goes
to
the
bottom
of
the
journeyman
seniority
roster.
that
permits
--
it
obvious
purposes
to
permit,
the
men
on
a
seniority
roster
to
be
able
to
look
at
it
and
know
where
they
stand
down,
where
they
will
continue
to
stand
with
reference
to
the
people
ahead
of
them
on
the
seniority
roster.
and
doesn't
permit
men
from
other
shops
or
other
points
on
the
railroad
company
to
come
in
and
get
ahead
of
them
on
a
seniority
roster
to
the
point
that
they
maybe
affected
by
a
layoff
where
they
otherwise
would
not.
that's
the
traditional,
basic
concept
in
--
with
these
threats
and
seniority
with
railroad
companies.
now,
in
this
case,
mr.
brooks
was
entitled
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
retroactive
seniority
at
monroe
but
in
fact,
he
seeks
it
in
north
little
rock.
now,
there's
only
one
court
of
appeals
case
that
has
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
of
where
the
rights
arising
out
of
transfer,
benefits
accruing
from
transfer
are
subject
to
the
mckinney
standard
in
the
same
sense
that
benefits
arising
out
of
promotion
are.
that
is
whether
it
must
be
automatic
and
as
a
matter
of
contract
right,
that's
the
horton
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
clearly
said
that
there's
no
distinction
that
--
that
transfer
and
promotion,
benefits
arising
from
those
things
are
subject
to
the
mckinney
standard
and
certainly,
i
can
find
no
logical
reason
why
that
shouldn't
be
a
applied.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
significant
factor
was
not
--
that
he
had
no
contract
right
to
be
at
north
little
rock
--
to
transfer
at
north
little
rock
and
thereby
seek
his
retroactive
seniority
there.
he
had
none
and
no
contract
right,
the
district
court
said
the
significant
thing
was
that
he
did
do
it,
he
did
do
it
in
fact.
it's
clear
he
--
he
was
in
st.
louis,
he
requested
the
transfer
of
his
master
mechanic
in
st.
louis
who
gave
his
approval
and
then
he
requested
the
transfer
of
the
master
mechanic
at
north
little
rock
where
he
was
seeking
to
go,
who
gave
his
approval.
there's
no
doubt
that
that
was
a
result
of
exercise
managerial
discretion.
in
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
significant
factor
was
that
he
did
transfer.
and
not
where
they
had
a
right
to
do
it,
is
contrary
to
this
court's
holding
in
mckinney
which
was
specifically
that
a
gratuitous
benefit
conferred
by
management.
the
one
required
does
not
thereby
enlarge
the
veteran's
rights.
in
mckinney,
the
man
had
been
assigned
to
the
group
1
position
on
return,
it
appeared
that
he
did
not
--
that
--
that
he
--
that
the
company
wasn't
required
to
put
him
in
it.
the
company
contended
they
put
him
in
it
through
a
mistake
of
law.
and
this
court
says,
they're
making
a
difference
whether
the
mistake
of
law
or
not,
it
was
a
gratuitous
benefit
to
which
he
wouldn't
entitle
as
a
matter
of
right
and
didn't
enlarge
his
rights.
i
think
to
have
the
case
in
the
proper
perspective,
appropriate
to
again,
referred
to
the
remarks
i've
made
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
the
railroad
company's
direct
interest
and
it's
liability
to
direct
injuries
that
result
to
this.
i
think
that
the
railroad
company's
probable
injury
would
not
be
great
and
then
certainly,
it
somewhat
remote
at
this
stage.
they're
probably
doing
here
is
dealing
with
--
of
course
they're
not
seeking
some
absolute
benefit
against
the
railroad
company
such
as
it
seems
on
an
hour
increase
in
pay.
we're
dealing
with
employees,
co-employees
seeking
benefits
relative
to
their
fellow
employees
and
which
they
can
have
and
enjoy
only
at
the
detriment
of
their
fellow
employees.
now,
these
fellow
employees
who
aren't
veterans
have
earned
seniority.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
think
that's
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
alright
i'm
--
i'm
--i've
been
unclear
on
that
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
the
question
mr.
justice
goldberg.
he
had
his
basic
rights
granted
under
this
act
when
he
returned
at
monroe
and
was
reemployed
as
an
apprentice
with
the
same
place
on
the
apprentice
seniority
roster,
the
same
relative
position
and
was
retained
there
for
the
year
required
by
the
act
and
was
returned
at
the
same
rate
of
pay.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir
but
i
believe
the
answer
to
the
overall
general
question
you
asked
is
in
mckinney
and
that
is
that
there's
much
that
he
was
called
to
the
colors
cannot
lay
claim
to
that
might've
come
by
chance
or
effort
or
training.
mr.
robert
v.
light
and
i
think,
the
very
basic
thing
that
they
intended
to
protect
by
this
act.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
--
the
amicus
brief
i
referred
to
mr.
justice
black
was
filed
in
both
this
case
in
tilton,
number
49
and
50
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
--
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
beg
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
oh,
i
see.
no
--
no
sir
--
no
sir,
they
filed
consolidated
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
brief.
