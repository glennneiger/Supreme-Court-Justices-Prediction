mr.
philip
b.
heymann
now,
this
--
this
case
is
in
most
respect
similar
to
tilton
or
at
least
that's
how
i
intended
to
begin
the
argument
though
i
can
see
that
--
that
will
require
some
arguing.
brooks
was
an
apprentice
when
he
went
off
to
the
service.
he
was
an
apprentice
machinist
not
a
carman.
the
apprenticeship
program
consists
of
1040
days
of
work
plus
successful
completion
of
a
correspondence
course.
after
1040
days
of
work,
the
apprentice
automatically
obtains
the
status
of
a
journeyman
machinist
but
he
doesn't
obtain
machinist
seniority
until
--
unless
he's
in
the
language
of
the
contract
continued
in
the
employment
in
the
language
of
common
sense
employed
for
one
day
as
a
journeyman
machinist.
he
has
to
be
employed
for
one
day
after
completion
of
1040-day
apprenticeship
period.
he
does
--
the
journeyman
machinist
does,
however,
have
a
right
to
do
work
of
a
journeyman
ahead
of
anyone
who
has
less
status
than
a
journeyman,
less
than
upgraded
apprentices.
i'd
--
i'll
remind
you
of
that
when
we
get
later
on
in
the
case.
brooks
was
called
away
as
an
apprentice
from
monroe,
louisiana.
he
returned
to
monroe,
louisiana
and
worked
there
in
his
--
after
his
military
service
and
worked
there
on
his
apprenticeship
until
the
--
there
was
a
layoff
at
monroe.
the
monroe
was
actually
disappearing
as
a
shop
where
work
was
being
done.
he
transferred
to
st.
louis
where
the
railroad
was
calling
for
apprentices
and
a
year
later
in
the
summer
of
1955,
he
trans
--
i
think
it
was
1955,
he
transferred
with
the
railroad's
permission
to
north
little
rock.
he
completed
his
1040
days
at
north
little
rock
and
was
thereupon
assigned
--
he
immediately
went
to
work
but
he
claimed
his
seniority
date
which
would
have
been
his,
had
he
been
continuously
employed
in
his
apprenticeship
program
during
the
period
he
was
away
in
military
service.
the
railroad
rejected
this.
the
district
court
this
time
found
in
favor
of
the
veteran
saying
that
his
process
would
have
been
--
now,
every
step
was
a
matter
of
right.
the
court
of
appeals
again
for
the
eight
circuit
reversed
this
time
merely
citing
its
tilton
opinion.
it
relied
on
the
fact
that
obtaining
work
as
a
journeyman
for
a
day
was
not
absolutely
certain
and
foreseeable
as
the
ground
for
reversal.
i've
said
that
in
most
respect,
this
case
is
in
our
view
similar
to
tilton.
as
in
tilton,
we
rely
and
deal
for
the
proposition
that
the
veteran
can
claim
as
a
matter
of
right
what
would
have
been
his
had
he
merely
been
continuously
on
the
job
and
at
work.
we
say
that
brooks'
job
was
the
job
of
being
an
apprentice
and
had
he
been
continuously
on
the
job,
he
would
have
had
the
seniority
date
he
claims
here.
it's
true,
as
my
discussion
would
--
in
line
of
my
discussion
with
justice
white
that
he
had
to
complete
a
correspondence
course.
however,
we
do
not
see
any
reason
for
treating
this
part
of
his
job,
a
required
correspondence
course,
as
different
from
any
other
part.
we
think
that
continuous
employment
includes
the
right
to
be
treated
as
continually
measuring
up
to
accept
its
standards
for
the
job,
and
we
think
that
accepted
standards
for
the
job
of
apprentice
is
accepted
progress
is
--
is
expected
progress
in
learning
during
your
apprenticeship
and
is
satisfactory
completion
of
whatever
correspondence
course
is
required.
i'd
like
to
make
an
alternative
argument
to
that
though
on
this
point
on
the
correspondence
course.
we
would
argue
that
a
veteran
has
a
right
to
be
treated
as
--
at
a
later
date
as
if
he
had
passed
a
qualifying
test
at
an
earlier
date,
once
he's
passed
it.
now,
let
me
step
back
on
that.
there's
no
question
between
any
parties,
i
don't
think
that
--
that
a
veteran
who
says
and
makes
out
a
claim
that
by
seniority
alone
would
have
been
--
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
fill
a
vacancy
during
his
absence,
is
entitled
to
have
that
position
on
his
return.
i
think
everybody
agrees
on
that.
now,
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
you
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
you
also
assume
that
he
was
present
and
wasn't
ill
and
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
you
--
you
--
you
assume
that
he
elected
to
give
up
seniority.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
bring
this
out,
all
the
factors
that
are
supposed
to
be
troublesome
in
this
case
are
conceded
in
that
case.
you
assume
that
he
elected
to
give
up
seniority
in
the
lower
job
in
order
to
get
the
higher
position
but
anyway,
that
is
conceded.
now
the
question
is
what
happens
if
the
employer
says
the
senior
man
in
category
one
is
entitled
to
a
promotion
to
group
two
if
he
has
vision
of
20/50
or
no
better
or
no
worst.
we
would
say,
when
that
employee
returns
and
takes
an
eye
test
and
is
shown
he
has
20/20
vision,
he
can
still
claim
the
vacancy
that
was
filled
during
his
absence
and
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
even
though
he
had
to
pass
a
qualification
test,
and
he
couldn't
pass
it
because
he
was
away
in
military
service.
now,
we
would
say
the
same
thing
of
any
objective
tests,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
to
us
whether
it
says
he
has
to
have
an
iq
of
100
or
whether
it
says
he
has
to
satisfactory
--
satisfactorily
pass
any
objective
test,
any
test
that
doesn't
involve
management
--
the
--
the
marking
of
which
did
not
involve
management
discretion
and
we
would
treat
the
correspondence
course
that
way
even
if
we
weren't
--
if
even
if
we
didn't
simply
sweep
it
in
with
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
--
we
have
to
do
that
because
the
largest
extent
advancements
could
be
denied
to
veterans
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
not
for
discretion
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no
it
doesn't
apply
to
discretion.
i
don't
think
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
making
clear
one
point
that
is
crucial
to
our
case
and
then
i'm
afraid
i
left
very
obscure
yesterday.
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
veteran
has
any
rights
in
a
higher
position
until
after
he
has
fully
completed
any
work
requirement
that
the
employer
imposes.
he
must
actually
work
the
number
of
days
the
employer
requires
before
he
has
any
rights
in
a
higher
position.
now,
to
take
an
example
that
will
make
that
absolutely
clear.
if
the
employer
--
if
the
employee
has
worked
100
days
before
he
goes
into
military
service
and
then
misses,
let's
say
600
days
of
a
1040-day
period,
because
of
his
military
service.
when
he
returns,
he
must
work
940
more
days.
he
must
get
in
1040
days
of
actual
work.
this
--
this
case,
the
brooks
case,
and
the
tilton
case
which
was
the
last
one,
only
arise
after
he's
actually
completed
1040
days
of
actual
work.
at
that
point,
he
says,
“i'd
like
my
seniority
date
to
be
placed
so
i
haven't
lost
my
relative
seniority
position.”
and
that's
where
these
cases
begin
after
1040
days
of
actual
work.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
it
justice
brennan.
he
has
to
work
1040
actual
days
of
work
--
military
service
not
counted
towards
those.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
has
no
right
--
he
has
actually
under
the
contract
on
his
return,
certain
rights
to
work
ahead
of
other
people.
in
the
brooks
case,
an
apprentice
has
a
right
to
continue
his
apprenticeship.
in
the
cases
before
this,
a
upgraded
helper
has
a
right
to
work
ahead
of
those
who
were
junior
to
him
in
upgrading
but
does
it
on
--
he
has
certain
contract
rights
but
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
all
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
in
--
if
there
is
a
layoff,
if
there's
a
shutdown,
anything
that
happens
after
his
military
service
is
at
the
employee's
peril.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he's
subject
to
all
those
perils.
now,
we
--
i
had
argued
yesterday
that
the
function
of
the
statute,
or
the
most
important
function
is
to
grant
the
veteran
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right,
what
would've
been
his
as
a
matter
of
contract
right,
had
he
been
“continuously
employed.”
those
words
have
been
used
all
the
way
back
to
fiscal
decision
at
the
very
beginning.
i
then
argued
that
the
quotes
were
taken
from
around
the
words
“continuously
employed”
in
a
diehl
for
the
first
time.
the
issue
what
“continuously
employed”
meant
was
squarely
faced
and
decided
and
it
was
held
that
it
means
continuously
at
work
when
--
when
the
veteran
would've
had
a
right
to
work.
that
was
the
only
case
that
has
taken
the
quotes
away
from
the
words
“continuously
employed.”
and
i
finally
said
that
in
the
mckinney
case,
the
mckinney
case
was
a
case
that
again
could
be
decided
with
the
quotes
around
continuously
employed.
it
said
the
veteran
can
only
claim
what
would
be
his
as
a
matter
of
right,
had
he
been
continuously
employed
when
he
was
in
military
service.
he
cannot
claim
what
would've
been
his
only
in
the
employer's
discretion,
had
he
not
been
in
military
service.
but
only
one
case
has
passed
on
exactly
what
“continuously
employed”
means
and
that's
the
diehl
case
and
that's
never
been
overruled.
i
had
begun
to
discuss
brooks
yesterday,
brooks
was
an
apprentice
in
contrast
to
diehl
who
was
an
upgraded
helper.
and
i'd
said
that
the
requirement
of
finishing
1040
days
of
apprenticeship
was,
we
believed,
identical
to
the
requirement
of
working
1040
days
as
an
upgraded
helper
in
diehl,
i'd
also
talked
about
the
requirement
of
a
correspondence
course.
there
are
two
other
things
i
should
mention
in
brook
--
brooks,
two
other
points
that
i
do
not
think
are
difficulties
but
they
are
points.
the
first
is,
the
respondent
suggests
that
the
fact
that
brooks
transferred
a
number
of
times
after
returning
to
monroe,
louisiana,
maybe
relevant
to
this
case.
one
of
those
transfers
was
apparently
a
discretionary
transfer
with
the
employer.
my
answer
to
that
is
very
much
what
i
answered
justice
stewart
before.
“we're
only
reconstructing
his
time
of
military
service.
he
left
monroe,
louisiana
and
he
returned
to
monroe,
louisiana.
he
claims
the
right
to
be
treated
during
that
gap
in
his
employment
career
as
if
he
had
been
continuously
employed.”
there
are
no
transfers
as
to
the
rest
of
his
career
after
his
return,
he
takes
that
as
it
falls,
that's
his
actual
history
of
--
he
gets
lot
of
days
of
work,
that's
fine
if
doesn't,
that's
fine
too.
when
brooks
returned
to
monroe,
louisiana
after
his
military
service,
he
had
certain
statutory
rights
because
there
would've
been
contract
rights
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
one
of
those
was
a
right
to
be
treated
as
if
he
had
worked
whenever
he
would've
had
the
right
to
work,
had
he
not
been
in
service.
he
--
he
carried
this
with
him
wherever
he
went
later.
and
later
when
he
actually
completed
1040
days
of
actual
work,
he
could
count
these
days
in
setting
his
seniority
date.
later
transfers
just
aren't
relevant
in
the
case.
the
final
variation
in
the
case
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
mr.
justice
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
--
he
was
doing
the
same
kind
of
work.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it
would
--
it
--
yes,
they're
certainly
relevant
in
the
sense
that
he
has
to
actually
work
and
that
the
days
of
actual
work
are
counted
up
and
had
he
--
had
he
failed
to
get
work
after
he
returned
from
monroe,
louisiana,
could
he
--
and
had
he
not
been
able
to
find
work
as
an
apprentice,
that
would've
slowed
him
down
very
much.
the
last
--
their
variation
is
the
one
the
eighth
circuit
decided
on.
the
eighth
circuit
said
in
its
decision
in
this
case
that
brooks
had
no
right
to
be
employed
as
a
journeyman
in
north
little
rock
on
november
3rd,
1955,
the
date
everyone
has
agreed
for
purposes
of
this
case
or
for
purposes
of
dating
that
he
would've
finished
his
apprenticeship.
they
say
moreover,
it
was
certainly
unforeseeable
that
there
would've
been
a
shortage
of
a
--
of
journeymen
machinist
at
that
time.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
have
to
take
the
court
back.
i
had
said
yesterday
that
seniority
as
a
journeyman
begins
on
the
first
date
that
an
apprentice
works
as
a
journeyman
after
completing
his
apprenticeship
period.
it
doesn't
begin
on
the
last
date
of
completing
the
apprenticeship
period
but
on
the
first
day
of
work
as
a
journeyman.
well,
to
the
eighth
circuit's
decision,
we
say
that
brooks
had
the
very
sort
of
right
to
work
as
a
journeyman
on
november
3rd,
1955
but
the
statute
gives
him
a
statute
that
the
statute
protects.
he
had
a
right
to
be
employed
ahead
of
all
those
who
were
actually
doing
journeyman
work
on
that
date.
not
all
of
those,
all
those
upgraded
apprentices.
the
record
is
clear
that
there
were
number
of
vacancies
for
a
journeyman's
work
on
november
3rd,
in
november,
1955,
that
these
were
being
filled
by
upgraded
apprentices
and
that
any
journeyman
would've
had
a
right
to
bump
all
--
what
of
--
well,
the
first
or
anyone
of
the
upgraded
apprentices
and
take
that
work.
all
the
statute
requires
in
the
way
of
a
right
to
a
promotion
or
a
right
to
a
seniority
date
or
a
right
to
work,
is
a
right
to
fill
a
vacancy
ahead
of
all
the
other
claimants.
that's
--
that's
the
holding
of
the
mckin
--
of
mckinney
on
remand,
i
don't
know.
the
court
remanded
mckinney
to
determine
whether
mckinney
would've
had
a
right
ahead
of
all
other
claimants
to
a
--
a
vacancy
in
group
1,
he
had
been
in
group
2.
and
the
--
the
only
right
that
the
court
required
was
a
right
ahead
of
all
other
claimants
to
fill
a
vacancy
that
in
fact,
existed.
brooks
had
a
right
ahead
of
a
number
of
claimants
to
fill
a
vacancy
that
actually
existed
at
the
time
he
would've
completed
his
apprenticeship,
he
had
a
right
to
work
as
a
journeyman
at
that
time.
it's
--
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
he
--
as
a
practical
matter,
he
had
a
right
against
his
employer
too.
his
employer
could
only
have
failed
to
hire
him
as
a
journeyman
by
discharging
a
number
of
upgraded
apprentices
and
seen
a
great
deal
of
--
of
machinist
work
left
undone.
the
other
fork
of
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
was
that
even
if
this
maybe
so,
the
fact
that
vacancies
would
exist
on
november
3rd
was
certainly
unforeseeable
when
he
left.
this
is
the
heart
of
the
brooks
decision
and
the
foreseeability
is
very
much
part
of
the
decision
in
tilton.
we
believe
that
foreseeability
is
plainly
not
required
under
the
statute.
this
again
was
decided
in
the
mckinney
remand.
when
mckinney
left
for
service,
he
couldn't
have
known
that
there
would
be
a
vacancy
in
group
1
during
his
absence.
the
court
held
that
if
he
had
a
right
to
be
the
one
to
fill
that
vacancy,
he
was
entitled
to,
on
his
return,
to
be
given
that
vacancy.
now,
that
was
unforeseeable
but
the
court
squarely
held
that
he
had
that
right.
foreseeability
simply
doesn't
--
isn't
simply
--
isn't
a
requirement
for
the
veteran
to
assert
his
rights.
now,
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
just
about
three
or
four
sentences.
i've
argued
this
case
very
largely
in
terms
of
it
having
been
decided
in
diehl
that
a
veteran
should
be
treated
as
if
he
were
continuously
at
work,
and
this
decision
not
having
been
later
reversed
by
the
court
in
mckinney,
mckinney
involving
a
quite
different
problem.
i'd
like
to
say
in
conclusion
that
even
if
diehl
were
not
there,
the
diehl
result
seems
to
me,
to
be
almost
dictated
by
the
statute.
the
statute
directs
the
employer
in
the
courts
to
return
the
veteran
without
loss
of
seniority.
the
veterans
in
a
case
like
this
where
they
haven't
been
able
to
complete
a
number
of
days
work
requirement,
1040
days
in
both
this
cases
and
in
tilton,
have
sustained
a
very
substantial
loss
of
seniority.
there
is
no
question
but
the
best
approximation
of
maintaining
their
seniority
position
is
to
treat
them
as
if
they
had
been
at
work
whenever
they
had
a
right
to
work
and
not
to
treat
them
as
if
they
had
been
on
a
leave
of
absence,
which
is
one
thing
they
wouldn't
have
been
on.
against
that
best
approximation,
the
only
fact
--
there
are
no
factors
as
there
were
in
mckinney
that
weigh
against
adopting
that
best
approximation.
there
is
no
interference
with
the
employer's
discretion
which
were
in
the
court
in
mckinney.
there's
no
invitation
for
the
court
to
plunge
into
a
--
an
attempt
to
litigate
imponderables,
would
the
employer
have
promoted
this
man.
it's
simply
a
question
of
treating
this
if
he
had
worked
when
he
had
a
right
to
work.
i
think
the
diehl
result
would
be
reached
if
it
were
fresh
and
it
was
certainly
reached
in
diehl.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'd
only
like
to
make
clear
that
we
of
course,
do
not
claim
what
was
cut
--
what
we
did
claim
in
mckinney
and
that
is
that
the
veteran
is
entitled
to
everything
that
would've
come
to
him
as
a
matter
of
probability
had
he
been
continuously
employed,
we
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
what
he
could
have
had
as
a
matter
of
contract
right
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
are
many
cases
on
that
justice
white.
they
generally
go
on
whether
the
employer
has
sufficiently
indicated
that
he's
paying
for
work
service
--
for
actual
work.
if
he
will
not
count
time
of
--
on
leave
of
absence
towards
five
years'
pay,
a
special
pay
increase
for
five
years
then
we
don't
claim
it
for
the
veteran.
if
there's
an
--
if
he
calls
it
a
work
training
but
he
counts
time
on
leave
of
absence
and
sick
leave
and
anything
else,
then
we
claim
it
for
the
veteran.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
that
is
either
of
these
cases
because
i
think,
the
odds
are
very
much
in
favor
of
them.
but
in
that
situation,
if
--
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
say,
that
--
that
--
to
change
your
example
just
a
little,
i
don't
think
i'll
be
changing
its
content.
and
they
--
let's
say
the
inquirer
gave
a
test
to
the
employees
in
a
certain
group
during
his
absence
and
was
a
very
hard
test
and
it's
in
a
--
subjective
test
and
if
you
get,
“oh,
i
could
make
it.”
and
i
say
if
they
have
perfect
eyesight,
and
any
employee
with
perfect
eyesight
is
entitled
to
be
promoted
from
fireman
to
engineer.
we
would
say,
in
a
--
any
employee
of
a
particular
seniority
or
any
employee
in
a
particular
group,
we
would
say
that
even
though
50%
failed
that
test,
as
an
average.
when
the
employee
returns
and
takes
the
test
and
finds
that
he
has
absolutely
perfect
eyesight,
he's
entitled
to
be
given
the
position
of
engineer
with
the
seniority
that
he
would've
had,
had
he
gotten
it
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
right.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
would
say
that.
the
only
--
the
only
issue
on
this
case
is
dating.
what
date
should
the
man
be
given
and
for
dating
purposes,
we
would
say
if
all
that's
required
is
that
he's
--
have
completed
it,
that
he
performed
satisfactorily
in
the
training
requirement
and
worked
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
i
think
--
i
read
mckinney
is
simply
saying
that
the
employee
cannot
claim
what
was
--
what
could've
been
withheld
from
him
as
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
employer.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
--
i
believe
it
is
justice
goldberg,
i'm
certain.
i
should
say
that
the
rule
that
we
rely
on
very
strongly
which
gives
the
--
which
gives
the
journeyman
a
right
to
claim
work
away
from
upgraded
apprentices
is
an
unwritten
rule
that
appears
--
now,
conclusively
in
the
record,
we've
set
out
the
evidence
for
it
--
never
great,
but
it's
an
unwritten
rule.
i
--
i
think
that's
all
i
had
to
say.
thank
you
very
much.
