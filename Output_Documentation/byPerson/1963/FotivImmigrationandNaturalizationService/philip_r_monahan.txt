mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
a
possible
mootness
of
this
case,
which
you
raised
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
merits,
the
merits
of
this
case
which
have
never
been
reached
are
moot.
however,
as
long
as
there
is
a
debatable
issue
as
to
the
correctness
of
that
view
and
we
concede
that
it
is
a
debatable
point,
the
threshold
question
of
which
of
the
two
lower
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
should
decide
the
merit
is
not
eluded.
i
think
that
the
only
conditions
under
which
this
jurisdictional
question
which
is
the
only
question
before
this
court
would
be
moot
would
be,
if
the
alien
conceded
that
the
merits
were
moot
or
that
at
least
they
were
moot
beyond
any
current
venture.
now
the
government
believes
that
the
term
all
final
orders
of
deportation
may
pursuant
to
administrative
proceedings
under
section
242
b
of
this
act,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
are
the
crucial
words
of
section
106
a,
involved
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
term
refers
not
simply
to
the
deportability
adjudication
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
it
did.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
second
circuit
rejected
the
contentions
of
both
parties.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
court
did
not
decide
that.
they
said
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
to
that
question
i
think.
we
believe
–
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
yes
sir.
but
of
course
as
you
know,
mr.
justice
there
was
a
four-judge
defense
there
which
raises
questions
which
must
be
considered.
we
believe
that
the
best
term,
inception
106,
refers
not
simply
to
the
deportability
adjudication,
although
that
of
course
is
the
indispensable
prerequisite
to
the
issuance
of
any
final
order
of
deportation,
but
rather
as
the
word
themselves
to
us
naturally
connote,
the
actual
administrative
decree
or
directive
that
the
alien
be
deported
in
accordance
with
law.
and
now
since
this
order
has
historically
reflected
as
i
shall
point
out,
not
only
the
finding
of
deportability,
but
also
the
denial
of
any
application
for
administer
--
discretionary
relief
which
the
alien
may
have
thought
during
the
deportation
proceeding
that
these
natural
import
of
the
provision
vesting
authority
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review
all
final
orders
of
deportation
is
to
empower
and
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
denials
of
the
administrative,
the
discretionary
relief
as
well
as
to
the
basic
deportability
adjudication
itself.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
mr.
justice
the
deportation
order
encompasses
both
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
always
and
therefore
it
is
the
government's
position
and
the
petitioner
agrees
i
believe
that
there
should
be
just
one
single
appeal
from
that
final
order
and
that
the
majority's
view
that
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
only
from
the
deportability
adjudication
and
they
suggest
a,
a
invite
at
least,
a
holding
that
there
would
be
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
discretionary
determination,
namely
the
denial
of
suspension
deportation
to
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
he
must
ask.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
must
ask
for
it.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
must
ask
for
it
during
the
deportation
proceeding
that's
clear.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
then
the
special
enquiry
officer
who
is
the
hearing
officer
comes
down
with
a
decision
in
order
at
the
end
of
the
whole
proceeding
(inaudible)
basic
ruling
would
of
course
be
better
not,
he
is,
the
person
as
deportable
because
he
is
not
deportable
and
that
ends
the
whole
matter,
but
if
the
decision
is
that
he
has
deportable
under
the
law
then
the
special
enquiry
officer
in
the
same
decision
and
order
also
disposes
of
the
prayer
for
discretionary
relief.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
he
never
--
here
is
what
the
determination
with
respect
to
deportability
is
until
the
final
order
comes
down
all
in
one
package.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
he
would
loose
that
right,
as
a
matter
of
right
if
he
does
not
ask
the
immigration
authority
to
hold
in
abeyance
the
direction
to
affect
the
voluntary
departure
until
the
conclusion
of
his
appeal.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
don't
think
that's
never
this
case
your
honor
for
this
reason.
the
problem
which
you
have
raised
would
be
true
no
matter
which
court
the
alien
should
appeal,
should
file
his
petition
for
reviewing,
whether
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
think
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
think
so.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
would
think
so,
that
whoever
is
not
involved
in
case
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
amicus
in
this
case
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
the
order
on
the
special
enquiry
officer
denied
the
prayer
for
suspension,
but
in
the
same
order
granted
voluntary
departure.
the
amicus
contests
the
government's
conclusion
that
there
is
an
outstanding
order
of
deportation
now
as
the
petitioner
has
conceded
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
district
directives
--
direction
to
the
alien
to
affect
his
departure
on
or
before
december
18th,
1961.
the
district
director
said
failure
to
exercise
is
probably
--
where
as
this
affect
by
state
may
result
in
the
withdrawal
of
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
however,
on
that
same
date
on
which
that
directive
was
issued
the
district
director
also
said,
also
stated
to
the
alien
and
this
appears
at
page
93
of
the
government's
brief,
in
the
event
that
you
should
fail
to
depart
voluntarily
within
the
time
authorized
then
pursuant
to
the
order
of
deportation
in
your
case
and
section
243
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
your
deportation
to
italy
has
been
directed.
now
it
seems
to
me
the
tying
that
order
together
with
the
district
director's
direction
to
hold
into
affective
departure
on
or
before
that
date
together
with
special
enquiry
officer's
original
order
which
combined
the
two
that
the
contingent
order
of
deportation
which
was
contained
in
the
special
enquiry
officer's
original
order
rested
so
to
speak
upon
the
aliens
failure
to
affect
his
departure
by
december
18th.
however,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
mr.
justice
that
the
government
does
not
believe
that
this
case
hinges
in
any
way
upon
criminal
or
not,
the
petitioner
is
still
technically
under
a
voluntary
departure
order.
even
assuming
for
argument
that
he
still
maybe
considered
to
be
under
the
order
of
voluntary
departure
and
not
technically
under
a
final
order
of
deportation,
the
special
inquiry
officer's
basic
order
of
september
19th
in
which
he
granted
voluntary
departure
but
(inaudible)
right
into
it
a
contingent
order
that
he,
that
a
deportation
order
would
immediately
come
into
affect
without
any
further
proceedings
if
he
fails
to
avail
himself
of
voluntary
departure
is
a
final
order
of
deportation
within
the
meaning
of
section
106.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
i
want
to
emphasize
though
that
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
hinges
upon
the
corrective
position
of
that.
even
if
he
is
still
under
voluntary
departure
that
order
is
the
final
order
deportation
in
the
practical
sense
of
section
106.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
is
nothing
further
--
the
alien
knows
that
if
he
does
not
affect
voluntary
departure
he
knows
that
that
any
further
administrative
proceeding
he
will
be
deported.
now
prior
to
1940,
the
distinction,
which
i
have
been
putting
some
emphasis
here
upon
namely
this
the
distinction
between
an
order
of
deportation
and
the
adjudication
of
deportability
would
not
been
important
because
prior
to
that
year
the
attorney
general
had
no
discretion
with
respect
to
deporting
a
deportable
person.
the
order
of
deportation
followed
automatically
and
invariably
upon
a
determination
that
the
alien
was
deportable
under
the
law,
but
in
1940
the
attorney
general
was
given
this
new
and
important
power
to
suspend
the
deportation
of
an
alien
who
was
deportable
either
admittedly
so
or
found
to
be
so
in
case
of
extreme
hardship
and
the
second
power
of
committing
him
to
depart
voluntarily.
now
--
and
from
the
beginning,
from
the
beginning
by
regulations
having
the
force
of
law,
this
dispensing
power
has
been
exercised
in
the
deportation
proceeding
itself
by
the
same
officer
who
has
the
power
--
to
whom
has
been
delegated
by
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
issue
the
deportation
order
with
the
result
that
where
suspension
has
been
granted
there
is
no
deportation
order.
therefore,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
considering
all
these
factors
that
a
realistic
and
reasonable
reading
of
the
phrase,
final
order
of
deportation
in
the
light
of
this
(inaudible)
to
which
i
have
referred
encompasses
not
only
the
basic
deportability
adjudication
as
the
majority
below
thought,
but
encompasses
the
adverse
disposition
of
any
petition
for
discretionary
relief
which
the
alien
may
have
asked
for.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
am
not
sure
–
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes
sir,
but
that's
commonly
done.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
and
that
would
involve,
that
would
involve
the
question,
a
possible
question
of
eligibility
which
maybe
a
purely
legal
question
and
possibly
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
there
is
no
--.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
by
no
means.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
have
not
finished
my
argument.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess
on
thursday
the
court
will
recall,
i
had
been
seeking
to
show
that
the
party's
construction
of
section
106
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
–
which
would
construe
that
section
as
applying
to
the
attorney
general's
denial
of
discretionary
determinations
during
the
deportation
proceeding
as
well
as
to
the
basic
deportability
adjudication
was
supported
by
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
rather
than
the
majority
construction.
today
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
show
that
that
construction
is
corroborated
and
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
of
section
106
and
then
to
make
a
point
by
point
reputation
of
certain
objections
which
the
majority
found
with
the
party's
construction
in
this
case.
the
fundamental
purpose
of
this
new
statute,
section
106,
the
legislative
history
shows,
was
to
abbreviate
the
process
of
judicial
review
in
order
to
forestall
certain
dilatory
tactics
in
the
courts,
which
had
come
to
congress'
attention.
the
chief
feature
of
the
plan
was
the
elimination
of
the
previous
first
step
in
the
judicial
review
process,
the
suit
in
the
district
court
and
thereby
to
limit
the
review
procedure
to
suits
in
the
court
of
appeals
subject
of
course
to
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
now
in
elucidating
the
purpose
of
legislation
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives,
representative
walter,
the
chairman
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
affairs
subcommittee
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
the
chief
sponsor
of
this
measure,
said
and
this
language
appears
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief,
“most
important
by
eliminating
review
in
the
district
courts,
the
bill
would
obviate
one
of
the
primary
causes
of
delay
in
the
final
determination
of
all
questions
which
may
arise
in
a
deportation
proceeding.”
it
seems
to
the
government
that
that
language
is
particularly
pertinent
in
light
of
the
fact
which
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
on
thursday
that
from
the
beginning
discretionary
determinations
have
been
among
the
issues
which
have
arisen
in
the
deportation
proceeding.
now
secondly
as
examples
of
the
evils
which
this
proposed
legislation
was
designed
to
correct,
the
committee
reports
accompanying
the
bills
which
eventuated
in
section
106,
referred
to
a
number
of
case
histories
or
proceedings
which
in
the
view
of
the
committee
had
involved
abuse
of
the
judicial
process
by
dilatory
suits.
included
among
these,
were
several
in
which
the
alien
had
sought
review,
among
other
orders,
orders
denying
discretionary
determinations
which
seemed
to
the
government
to
be
further
collaborative
of
the
objective
of
this
legislation.
thirdly
there
appears
in
the
committee
reports
a
reference
chart
which
illustrates
in
diagrammatic
form
the
various
administrative
steps
leading
to
a
final
order
of
deportation.
now
that
chart
we
have
reproduced
at
page
94
of
the
government's
brief
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
and
it
shows
that
the,
as
i
say
in
this
diagrammatic
form,
that
the
final
order
of
deportation
is
the
ultimate
product
resulting
from
first
of
course
the
deportability
adjudication.
secondly,
the
denial
of
suspension
of
deportation
or
a
voluntary
departure
where
one
or
the
other
of
those
forms
of
relief
have
been
requested
and
thirdly
the
failure
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
where
an
appeal
to
that
body
has
been
taken
to
disturb
the
special
enquiry
officers'
decision.
fourthly
and
finally,
there
occurred
on
the
house
floor,
during
the
debates
on
this
measure
in
the
congress
immediately
preceding
the
congress
in
which
the
bill
was
ultimately
enacted
an
important
colloquy
between
representative
walter,
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
representative
moore
another
member
of
the
committee
who
was
a
co-sponsor
of
this
measure,
and
representative
lindsay
of
new
york
who
as
the
dissenting
judges
below
pointed
out
was
very
familiar
with
the
part
played
in
the
deportation
process
by
discretionary
determinations
as
a
result
of
his
argument
of
jay
against
boyd
before
this
court
on
behalf
of
the
government.
now
this
colloquy
is
referred
to
at
some
length
is
both
the
majority
and
the
descending
opinions
below
and
it
is
set
forth
fully
in
the
government's
brief.
briefly--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
appears
at
pages
30
to
35
mr.
justice
and
i
will
just
take
the
time
at
this
time
to
refer
the
court
to
the
--
that
part
of
the
colloquy,
which
appears
on
page
34
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
mr.
lindsay
says,
“is
it
not
true,”
speaking
to
mr.
moore,
“is
it
not
true
that
the
words,
‘final
deportation
order'
does
not
take
effect
until
after
the
determination
of
the
question
of
suspension?”
mr.
moore
says,
“that
is
the
manner
in
which
i
understand
the
meaning
of
the
term
as
used
in
the
pending
bill.”
then
mr.
walter
says,
“mr.
speaker,
during
the
course
of
the
discussion,
the
gentleman
from
new
york,
mr.
lindsay,
raised
a
question
of
suspension
of
deportation.
i
might
say
to
the
gentleman
from
new
york,
that
the
six
months
period
on
the
question
of
finality
of
an
order
applies
to
the
final
administrative
adjudication
of
the
applications
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
just
as
it
would
apply
to
any
other
issue
brought
up
in
a
deportation
proceeding.”
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
various
specific
criticisms
of
the
party's
construction
made
by
the
majority
below.
none
in
our
view
have
validity.
the
majority
refers
to
paragraph
four
of
the
exceptions,
there
are
nine
exceptions
to
the
application
of
section
106,
and
that
appears
on
page
58
of
the
government's
brief,
in
which
it
is
stated
that
except
as
provided
in
clause
b
of
paragraph
5
of
this
subsection,
the
petition,
that
is
the
petition
for
review,
shall
be
determined
solely
upon
the
administrative
record
upon
which
the
deportation
order
is
based.
and
the
attorney
general's
findings
of
fact,
if
supported
by
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
on
the
record
considered
as
a
whole,
shall
be
conclusive.
now,
we
agree
with
the
majority
that
that
clause,
paragraph
4
applies
and
can
only
apply
to
the
deportability
adjudication,
because
a
discretionary
determination
as
the
court
knows
does
not,
in
all
circumstances,
have
to
be
rendered
upon
the
record,
materials
or
the
record,
maybe
used
under
some
circumstances,
as
the
court
said
in
jay
against
boyd
and
also
since
–
precisely
because
it
is
a
discretionary
determination
it
does
not
have
to
be
based
upon
the
reasonable
substantial
evidence
rule.
however,
the
majority
assumes
that
the
scope
of
section
--
of
that
paragraph
4,
which
i
just
read,
is
co-extensive
with
the
scope
of
the
principal
provision
of
section
106.
now
the
government
that
--
we
think
there
is
some
force
to
this
point.
in
fact,
we
think
that
this
is
perhaps
the
principal,
the
principal
point
that
the
majority
makes.
however,
in
the
government's
view
it
would
not
be
surprising
for
congress
to
include
in
an
overall
enactment,
dealing
with
the
judicial
review
of
final
orders
of
deportation,
a
particular
provision
pertinent
to
what
is
after
all
the
principal
constituent
of
such
an
order,
the
determination
or
deportability.
now
the
majority
further
argues
in
its
opinion,
further
point
it
says
in
its
opinion
that
it
is
in
the
last
degree
unlikely
to
use
the
majority's
language
that
congress
meant
to
require
that
discretionary
determinations
be
initially
reviewed
by
a
court
of
three
judges,
namely
courts
of
appeals
and
it
says
that
this
is
true
especially
in
light
of
a
general
command
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
agency
action,
which
is
by
law
committed
to
agency
discretion,
shall
not
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
we
think
there
are
several
answers
to
this
point
made
by
the
majority.
first,
the
same
provision
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
which
the
majority
refers
accepts
from
that
exclusion
instances
where
there
has
been
abuse
of
discretion
and
we
see
no
good
reason
for
assuming
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
this
important
function
of
setting
aside
agency
action
because
of
abusive
discretion,
that
that
be
discharged
in
the
first
instance
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
moreover,
not
all
challenges
of
denials
of
discretionary
relief
involve
mere
charges
of
abuse
of
discretion
as
the
majority
seems
at
this
point
to
assume.
much
of
the
litigation
in
this
area
involves
disputed
issues
of
eligibility
for
this
form
of
relief,
which
in
turn
very
frequently
involve
pure
customs
law,
statutory
construction,
the
questions
which
are
within
the
special
confidence
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
thirdly
most
important,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
this
objection
by
the
majority
overlooks
the
fundamental
purpose
of
section
106,
which
was
the
elimination
of
the
district
court
stage
of
the
review
of
deportation
orders.
now
the
majority
also
says
that
it
is
incredible,
to
use
the
majority's
language,
that
congress
meant
to
require
denials
of
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure
to
come
within
the
scope
of
section
106
and
it
says
--
and
yet
if
the
denial
of
suspension
of
deportation
comes
within
it,
then
there
is
no
reason
for
assuming
the
denial
of
voluntary
departure
does
not.
we
agree
that
that
they
are
both
--
that
they
both
stand
or
fall
together,
but
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
have
just
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
it
does
not
seem
to
the
government
to
be
incredible,
the
congress
intended
denials
of
voluntary
departure
to
come
before
the
courts
of
appeals,
particularly
when
it
is
recalled
that
it
is
undisputed
that
these
will
eventually
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
event
if
the
district
court
denied
the
request
and
if
the
alien
chose
to
seek
review
of
it.
next,
the
majority
raises
the
question
of
whether
section
--
whether
the
denial
of
relief
under
section
243
(h)
is
subject
to
106.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
section
243
(h)
is
that
provision
of
the
law,
which
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
withhold
temporarily
deportation
to
a
--
a
specified
country
on
the
ground
that
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
physical
prosecution
in
that
country.
the
majority
seeks
to
put
the
government
and
petitioner
in
a
dilemma
so
to
speak
by
saying
that
that
can't
come
under
section
106
because
that
that
decision
is
made
by
an
officer
other
than
the
special
enquiry
officer
who
presides
at
the
deportation
proceeding
and
yet
majority
says
it
is
hardly
rationale
that
the
two
types
of
relief
are
so
similar,
that
it's
hardly
rationale
to
suppose
that
a
distinction
can
be
drawn.
we
agree
with
the
majority
that
under
section,
under
the
procedure
traditionally
followed
under
section
243
(h)
those
denials
would
not
come
within
the
section
106
precisely
for
the
reasons
pointed
to
by
the
majority
namely
that
the
processing
of
such
an
application
occurs
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
the
deportation
order
and
is
heard
by
an
officer
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
deportation
proceeding.
therefore
we
agree
that
those
243
(h)
denials
do
not
come
within
106,
but
we
see
no
reason
for
concluding
that
merely
because
that
form
of
relief
is
not
subject
to
106
that
the
denials
of
suspension
of
deportation,
which
all
the
evidence
indicates
was
intended
to
come
within
section
106
should
be
held
to
fall
without
that
reason.
there
is
certain
another
--
there
are
few
other
objections
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
for
these
reasons
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse
with
directions
to
entertain
this
petition
for
review.
