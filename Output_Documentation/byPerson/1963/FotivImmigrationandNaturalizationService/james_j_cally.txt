mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
there
is
really
only
one
issue
here
involved
and
that
issue
sirs
is
whether
or
not
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
orders
of
the
special
enquiry
officer
as
authorized
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
be
made
in
certain
cases
and
situations.
sometime
in
september,
on
september
the
26th,
1961,
congress
passed
the
legislation,
thereby
empowering
we
believe
the
circuit
court
to
rule
and
review
on
these
matters
which
have
been
made
final
administratively
as
far
as
a
special
enquiry
officer
is
concerned,
and
then
to
the
board
of
immigration
of
appeals
in
washington
where
they
have
the
last
say
administratively
as
far
as
a
person
is
concerned.
in
this
sense,
that
matter
was
done
and
thereafter
in
a
declaratory
judgment
the
matter
was
taken
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
judge
there
hearing
the
matter
said
i
am
sorry,
we
have
no,
we
no
longer
have
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
now
lies
with
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
we
pursued
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
we
did
not
have
the,
that
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
section
106
of
immigration
nationality
act
or
8
u.s.c.,
section
1105a,
which
is
entitled,
“judicial
review
of
orders
of
deportation
and
exclusion,”
and
the
words
to
which
they
take
exception
to
are
“judicial
review
of
all
final
orders
of
deportation.”
those
are
the
magic
words
which
they
say
does
not
encompass.
this
case
and
therefore
is
without
the
orbit
of
their
jurisdiction.
it
is
our
contention
sirs,
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
that
there
is
an
outstanding
order
of
deportation
even
though
the
issuance
of
their
warrant
maybe
stayed
and
that
there
are
certain
graces
which
maybe
greater
among
which
are
suspension
of
deportation
or
a
voluntary
departure,
if
executed
within
the
time
allocated
by
the
administrative
officer.
mr.
james
j.
cally
well
there
actually
is
no
difference
mr.
chief
justice.
there
isn't
any
difference.
we
say
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
hand
down
a
decision
on
this
matter,
as
is
the
government's
contention.
we
say
that
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
they
have
ruled
on
this
matter
already
in
the
affirmative
saying
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction
and
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
in
their
two
cases
i
believe
in
the
zupicich
case
and
in
the
jova
case
was
in
the
ninth
district,
have
also
ruled
in
the
district
that
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
that
the
jurisdiction
properly
belongs
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
--
and
to
that
effect
the
government
does
not
disagree
with
us.
the
government
says
yes,
we
agree
with
you,
let's
have
that
court
give
us
a
ruling
on
the
facts
as
we
submit
them.
mr.
james
j.
cally
no
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
j.
cally
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
is
a
debatable
question.
i
won't
go
into
that
at
this
moment.
there
is
legislation
as
you
very
properly
put
and
adequately
that
it
was
passed
which
indicates
that
a
seaman
who
came
and
over
stayed
his
leave
in
this
country
can
no
longer
have
any
of
these
privileges
that
were
afforded
to
him
previously.
however,
it's
debatable
whether
or
not
that
is
retroactive.
it's
debatable
whether
or
not
he
shouldn't
receive
these
particular
privileges
which
could
be
accorded
to
him
because
this
wasn't
in
relation,
in
fact
this
came
much,
much
before
the
time
it
could
have
been
to
settled
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
james
j.
cally
i
don't
know,
i
frankly
can't
answer
that
at
this
moment,
because
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
before
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
think
the
only
issue
before
him
is,
whether
or
not
to
review
the
findings
of
the
special
enquiry
officer
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
any
abuse
of
discretion
as
to
this
decision
in
the
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
james
j.
cally
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
finally
we
conclude
that
this
matter
should
be
remitted
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
be
directed
to
give
us
a
decision
on
this
particular
matter.
thank
you.
