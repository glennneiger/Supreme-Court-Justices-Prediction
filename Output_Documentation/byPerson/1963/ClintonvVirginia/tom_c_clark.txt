justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
the
opinion
said
it
was
the
right
to
contact.
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
it
was
just
held
there,
wasn't
any
spike
or
anything?
the
policeman
just
held
it
against
the
wall,
would
that
evidence
be
legal?
justice
tom
c.
clark
although
there's
no
spike
or
anything.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
in
silverman
but
i
thought
that
there,
the
spike
gets
(inaudible)
which
created
an
area
of
sounding
board
which
amplified
the
sound
and
shout
it
into
the
other
room.
here,
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals,
well,
you
have
a
thumb
tack
operation,
for
all
i
know
the
thumb
tack
just
--
was
put
in
to
hold
this
machine
against
the
wall.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
have
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
spike.
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
for
me,
there
still
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
trespass,
some
kind
of
penetration.
i
think
the
very
prospects
of
each
--
this
kind
of
penetration
into
the
wall
of
the
other
room,
i
would
say
that
--
well,
i
--
getting
at
--
you
never
--
that
the
rights
were
not
introduced
into
evidence
or
anything,
was
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
was
the
argument?
was
there
any
argument
of
counsel
perhaps
a
--
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
--
i
think
on
silverman
or
something
in
the
argument,
its
just
what
the
device
was.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
the
counsel
tell
the
court
what
happened
(inaudible)
it
was?
justice
tom
c.
clark
by
the
judge
of
the
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
see
the
evidence?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
trial
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
petition
in
that
first
(inaudible)
(inaudible)
the
court
--
the
court
must
have
(inaudible)
this
burden
i
suppose
if
there
was
a
(inaudible)
penetrate
the
wall.
but
i'd
like
to
know
is
what's
the
penalty
is
under
the
first
count,
what's
the
penalty
in
the
--
there
are
two
different
statues
of
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
their
penalty
was
of
the
first
count?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
minimum
penalty
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
record
the
court
was
--
i
just
wonder
what
it
say?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
i
