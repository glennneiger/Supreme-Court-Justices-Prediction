justice
potter
stewart
i
was
reading
on
the
record
last
night
and
if
there
were
--
there's
just
a
slight
discussion
of
it
on
direct
examination
and
a
little
bit
more
on
cross
examination.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
remember
the
pages
on
which
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
where
it
begins,
mr.
(inaudible)
is
there
--
at
the
--
or
the
bottom
of
page
31.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
over
through
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
middle
of
32?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
on
cross
examination
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you,
i
couldn't
find
it.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
you
need
not
go
quite
so
far
as
you
indicated.
you
--
your
position
was
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
indeed,
you
in
other
words,
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
--
an
electronic
device
concealed
on
the
person
of
somebody
who
is
lawfully
in
the
constitution
--
what
the
area
which
would
otherwise
be
constitutionally
protected
at
least
such
as
on
lee
or
lopez.
this
doesn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
it's
completely
unknown
to
the
participants
in
the
conversation
in
the
other
room
if
there's
anybody
unless
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued,
although
you
don't
need
to
in
this
case
that
whether
--
whether
without
an
electronic
device,
today
as
a
part
of
houses
being
built,
many
of
them
where
they
are,
you
don't'
need
an
electronic
device
to
overhear
from
one
apartment
and
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
it
could
be
claimed
that
that
too
would
be
a
violation
of
--
for
instance,
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
done
deliberately
by
police
officers
surreptitiously
in
an
adjoining
apartment.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
recording
device,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
both
are
different
from
this.
they're
different
from
each
other
as
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
somewhat.
that
they
were
both
different
from
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
was
somebody
known
to
the
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
beyond
the
premises
and
with
whom
the
defendant
is
carried
on
an
unknowing
conversation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
these
arguments
you're
making
could
have
been
made
in
--
back
in
the
first
pair
of
eyeglasses,
spectacles
were
invented,
does
it?people
to
say,
"well,
witnesses
can
testify
to
what
they
can
see
with
their
naked
eye
but
with
these
new
fangled
things
in
the
future,
these
eyeglasses,
they
can
testify
to
everything
they
could
see,
only
that
way
which
i
couldn't
see
and
with
their
naked
eye."
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
i
mean
the
hearing
aid,
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
was
a
case
called
hester
where
there
was
a
physical
trespass,
an
actual
trespass
on
somebody's
land
where
they
said
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
trespass
of
the
--
or
its
absence
has
ever
been
the
--
the
only
test.
in
other
words,
even
prior
to
silverman,
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
actual
device.
justice
potter
stewart
the
silverman
case,
as
mr.
justice
clark
have
suggested,
we
--
counsel
had
in
--
here
in
this
courtroom,
the
actual
device.
i
have
in
my
office
(inaudible)
i
remember
12.
justice
potter
stewart
at
page
39,
the
defense
counsel
in
a
motion
to
the
strike
evidence
in
the
middle
paragraph
of
the
page
there,
"he
does
talk".
he
says,
officer
bates
(ph)
admittedly
was
--
obtained
the
evidence
of
officer
bates
(ph),
obtained
in
part
by
a
listening
device
which
was
stuck
into
the
wall,
according
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
it
was
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
so
when
he
asked,
the
court
strike
that
evidence.
i
suppose
that's
the
--
the
merits
became
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
she
was
acquitted
of
the
other
count,
the
appellee?
justice
potter
stewart
that
doesn't
quite
handle
this
situation,
is
it?
you're
telling
us
that
this
evidence
was
probative
only
with
respect
to
one
count
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
--
not
with
the
respect
to
both.
now,
your
point
would
be
a
very
valid
one,
it
seems
to
me
if
--
if
she
had
in
fact
been
acquitted
on
the
only
count
to
which
this
evidence
was
probative
then
--
and
no
--
there'll
be
no
damage
then
now
to
this
defendant
but
--
when
you
can't
tell
on
which
count
she
was
convicted.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
points
you're
making.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
on
the
first
--
on
the
numbered
page
of
your
appendix
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
brief?
