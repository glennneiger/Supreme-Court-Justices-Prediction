mr.
childress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
rec
--
anything
in
the
record,
mr.
childress,
that
will
show
us
just
what
kind
of
an
instrument
this
--
this
is
and
just
to
what
extent
it
--
it
was
--
that
that's
at
the
wall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
the
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
the
record?
there's
nothing
to
show
to
what
extent
it
was
stuck
in
the
wall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
noticed
that
the
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
it
as
attached
to
the
walls,
somewhat,
they
said,
thumbtack
would
do
it.
is
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
evidence
as
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
childress,
did
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
have
before
it
any
evidence
concerning
the
--
the
way
this
thing
was
attached
to
the
wall
other
than
what
we
have
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
mr.
--
mr.
childress.
mr.
tyler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
wasn't
of
any
value
to
why
this
was
introduced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
gave
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
gave
the
defendant
five
years
in
the
penitentiary,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
went
a
little
farther
than
that,
didn't
he?
he
said,
"yes,
it
was
a
spike
mic."
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
he
was
--
he
was
asked
if
it
was
a
spike
--
a
spike
mic
and
he
said,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
small
device
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tyler,
did
you
ever
see
this
device?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
available
so
that
the
court
could
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
counsel
would
agree
that
we
could
see
it?
is
it
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you?
would
you
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
seems
to
be
so
vital
if
it
was
a
spike
mic.
and
it
was
--
the
spike
was
injected
into
the
wall,
it
would
come
very,
very
close
to
--
to
silverman.
on
the
other
hand,
if
as
the
court
of
appeals
inferred
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
something
like
a
thumbtack
that
would
keep
it
from
falling
from
the
wall.
it
might
be
differentiated.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
if
it's
available
to
determine
what
the
true
fact
is
by
counsel
agreeing
to
show
it
to
us,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
don't
wish
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
had
(inaudible)
because
he
has
no
right
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
no
right
to
insist
on
it,
of
course.
it
isn't
in
the
record,
that's
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
--
i
--
i
think
mr.
tyler,
one
of
the
things
that
--
that
bother
us
here,
some
of
us
anyway
is
the
fact
that
the
officer
said
it
was
a
spike
mic.
he
answered
yes.
he
said
a
small
device.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
translated
that
into
the
fact
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
thumbtack
on
the
wall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
tell
us
and
counsel
tell
us
that
the
court
never
saw
it,
and
knows
no
more
about
it
--
about
it
than
--
than
we
do.
and
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
thumbtack
arrangement
or
--
or
a
spike
mic
as
the
--
as
the
officer
said
it.
and
it
might
be
of
some
interest
to
us
if
it
--
if
it
was
here,
that's
all
but
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
childress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
--
adjourn
now.
