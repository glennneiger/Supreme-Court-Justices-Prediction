mr.
calvin
h.
childress
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
nature
of
this
case
is
an
alleged
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
by
means
of
an
electronic
listening
device.
the
issues
here
are
whether
a
city
police
officer
have
used
an
electronic
listening
device
stuck
into
a
party
wall
and
this
enabled
him
to
hear
everything
that
went
on
in
the
adjoining
efficiency
apartment
occupied
by
the
petitioner,
constituted
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
in
addition
to
this
issue,
the
respondent
had
raised
four
questions
before
this
court.
he
has
suggested
that
although
this
search
took
place
for
three
days
before
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
that
the
search
was
valid
as
incident
to
a
legal
arrest.
he
selected
that
--
suggested
that
because
the
petitioner
was
suspected
of
running
an
illegal
place
that
she
forfeited
her
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
he's
also
suggested
that
evidence
obtained
by
electronic
means
should
not
be
completely
excluded,
which
point
the
petitioner
does
not
state
and
he
also
asked
this
court
to
review
all
the
evidence
if
it
finds
there
was
--
the
evidence
found
by
the
police
officer
was
improper
and
find
that
there
was
other
sufficient
evidence
to
find
the
accused
guilty.
this
is
sort
of
a
harmless
error
doctrine.
the
issue
as
to
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
by
the
electronic
listening
device,
the
trial
court
and
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
are
not
required
to
write
a
written
opinion
and
just
rule
that
it
was
a
proper
search
and
seizure
by
--
and
let
the
evidence
in.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
held
that
there
was
not
a
showing
of
a
physical
trespass
by
this
spike.
the
spike
was
just
stuck
in
the
wall.
and
therefore,
that
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
distinguishing
it
from
the
--
the
silverman
case
and
holding
under
the
goldman
case.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
sir.
at
page
31,
police
officer
bates
(ph),
who
used
it,
suggest
--
said
that
he
had
a
device
that
would
amplify
sound
so
that
you
could
hear
it
in
the
other
room.
and
then
he
asked
--
he
was
asked,
"was
it
a
spike
device?"
he
said,
"yes,
sir,
a
small
device."
and
then
on
cross
examination,
he
was
asked
whether
it
was
driven
in
the
wall
and
he
said,
"no,
sir."
â€œand
was
it
stuck
in
the
wall?"
"it
was
stuck
in
the
wall."
this
is
the
evidence
as
to
how
this
spike
device
was
used.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no
--
no,
your
honor.
there's
no
evidence
to
show
how
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
the
--
this
was
a
supposition
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
that
use.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
it
said,
if
the
evidence
was
that
it
was
stuck
in
the
wall
--
not
--
not
driven
in.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin

calvin

mr.

sir,
your

mr.
calvin
h.
childress
cross
examination
that
begins
on
page

middle
--
half
or
third
of
page
37.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
if
the
court
please,
i
submit
this
question
of
what
constitutes
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
should
--
should
be
faced
by
the
problems
that
we
--
modern
technology
and
invention
have
developed
to
our
forefathers
of
--
who
are
present
at
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
the
revolution.
the
problem
wasn't
reasonably
simple.
they
merely
broke
in
the
hearths.
but
now,
we
have
this
problem
of
the
electronic
eavesdropper.
this
court
has
cited
the
eavesdroppers,
the
volume
by
(inaudible)
and
it's
well
aware
of
the
large
problems
that
electronic
surveillance
present
nowadays.
we
--
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
eavesdroppers,
the
volume,
this
question
of
a
sonic
wave
flooding
a
room
and
bringing
it
back.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
its
decision
in
silverman
created
a
new
standard
as
to
what
constituted
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
before
silverman
beginning
with
olmstead,
it
was
held
olmstead
being
a
tapping
the
telephone
line,
that
there
had
to
be
a
physical
trespass.
it
constituted
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
it
acquainted
the
actual
physical
trespass
of
the
police
officer
into
the
premises
of
the
petitioner
with
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
this
was
adhered
to
in
goldman.
but
in
silverman,
with
the
case
of
the
--
despite
that
it
went
in
six
to
seven
inches
and
made
contact
with
the
dock
of
the
heating
system
and
it
appropriated
the
whole
heating
system
of
the
adjoining
building.
this
court
said
at
two
places
that
it
didn't
turn
upon
the
technicalities
of
local
trespass
law.
silverman
case
did
not
turn
upon
the
niceties
of
local
trespass
on
a
party
wall.
principle
was
enunciated
in
silverman,
it
was
a
case
turned
upon
the
--
the
reality
of
an
actual
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
and
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
section
on
tools
and
dash
and
open
a
sports
book,
the
eavesdropper
points
out
that
a
contact
mic,
a
spike
mic
is
use
to
get
access
into
a
room
where
you
don't
have
a
way
to
get
in
there,
any
other
way.
and
that
despite
by
making
contact
with
a
stud
allows
you
to
get
access
to
the
room
and
hear
what's
going
on.
now,
the
respondent
wrote,
professor
schwartz,
a
letter
on
that
which
appears
in
page
17
of
his
brief
but
i
believe
it
proved
too
much.
professor
schwartz
emphasized
there
that
walls
have
a
dead
air
space
between
them.
and
that
this
usually,
this
speaks
to
me
as
a
layman,
a
sort
of
an
insulated
situation.
and
the
sounds
don't
come
through
this
dead
air
space
and
professor
schwartz
said
that
"unless
you
have
a
spike
mic
that
go
through
that,
it's
quite
likely
that
no
other
microphone
would
also
work."
that's
--
now
when
--
but
this
--
this
is
the
problem.
what
constitutes
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
i
submit
to
the
court
that
as
i
read
silverman
versus
united
states,
it
does
set
up
this
new
standard
of
reality
of
an
actual
intrusion.
it
doesn't
speak
of
a
physical
intrusion.
and
then
under
this
new
standard,
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
instant
case
is
unreasonable.
i
suggest
that
the
court
should
again
reemphasize
the
standard.
it
--
it
is
a
standard
that
has
meaning
in
our
present
day
under
our
present
day
means
of
discovery.
and
in
--
in
--
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
olmstead
case,
a
discovery
and
invention
can
find
means
much
greater
than
constriction
on
the
rack
to
hearing
or
disclosing
what
was
whispered
in
a
closet.
and
this
is
the
situation
that
that
we
reached
today.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no
--
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
my
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
position
is
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
when
the
electronic
device
intrudes
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area
and
this
would
be
the
home,
the
house
or
the
office.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
(inaudible)
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes.
now
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
if
they
are
designed
to
and
actually
do
intrude
in
--
into
the
house
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
find
that
insofar
as
it
really
affect
the
home
of
a
host
and
are
designed
to
and
due
--
in
fact
intrude
into
the
house
and
there
would
be
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
because
the
evil
is
the
same.
the
--
the
design
of
these
electronic
listening
devices
are
to
invade
the
home.
to
find
out
what's
going
on
in
there.
and
whether
the
--
whether
the
spike
is
driven
six
inches
in
or
stuck
on
the
wall,
or
maybe
be
a
foot
away.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
submit,
this
is
the
problem
that
the
court
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
has
pointed
out
--
in
--
in
eavesdropping,
the
sonic
wave
questionnaire.
when
i
was
a
boy,
i
remember
flash
gordon
go
into
the
moon
on
a
rocket
ship,
this
was
science
fiction.
now
--
now
we
--
we
have
it
as
a
matter
of
science.
but
i
believe
the
court
could
properly
interpret
the
fourth
amendment,
should
allow
for
electronic
devices
which
can
completely
intrude
into
a
house
and
be
able
to
grasp
all
the
sounds
and
language
that
goes
in
there
and
bring
it
back
to
--
to
the
listener
without
any
physical
trespass.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
to
my
knowledge,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
has
no
statute
on
this.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
on
--
only
there
is
a
--
as
i
recall,
in
the
eavesdroppers,
i
believe
there
is
a
compilation
of
states
there.i
--
i
have
not
made
a
--
a
collection
on
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no.
this
isn't
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no
sir,
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
spike
device
stuck
in
a
wall,
not
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
there
--
there
is
that
problem.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no,
i
--
i
would
not
say
that
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this
question
of
electronic
listening
devices.
the
--
the
on
lee
of
course
was
a
transmitting
device.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
and
the
lopez
case
was
a
recording
device
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
with
which,
i
think
are
factually
different
from
this
type
of
device
and
i
think
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
and
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
what
the
case
where
it
--
you're
in
an
apartment
house,
this
is
the
--
a
normal
surveillance
and
if
you
can
--
i
believe
if
the
police
officer
can
hear
what
goes
onto
the
next
apartment,
then
this
is
a
proper
surveillance
now
under
our
constitutional
standard.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no,
the
same
question
arises.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
same
question
arises
because
proper
surveillance
from
outside
is
--
has
always
been
--
been
considered
a
proper
police
procedure.
and
i
have
taken
the
objection
to
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
that
is
the
longest
--
this
part
increases
his
personal
facilities,
faculties,
that
--
i
--
i
see
no
objection
to
it.
but
the
distinction
is
that
spy
glasses,
the
hearing
aid,
or
so
forth
are
not
designed
to
penetrate
in
through
a
--
a
wall,
penetrate
into
the
--
the
privacy
of
a
person's
home
to
protect
against
prying
eyes
and
we
do
have
a
peeping
tom
statute
in
the
state
of
virginia.
you
pull
down
to
your
window
shade.
to
protect
it
against
a
spike
mic,
professor
schwartz
in
eavesdroppers
say
you
have
to
fill
the
whole
inside
of
the
house
with
aluminum
foil.
and
i
submit
there
is
--
there
is
a
considerable
distinction
there
between
helping
the
faculties
by
glasses
or
even
an
elect
--
electric
flashlight,
as
suggested
by
the
--
the
respondent.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
--
this
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
the
witness
--
the
spike
mic
test
--
testimony
--
there
is
a
fractional
penetration
and
with
the
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
the
professional
scientific
test,
writing
of
the
eavesdroppers,
this
is
what
it's
designed
to
do,
the
contact
mic.
a
contact
mic
is
designed
to
penetrate
through
the
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
but
that
is
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
that
--
this
--
this
is
my
main
point,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
said
it
could
have
been
like
of
some
--
some
of
type.
but
this
was
not
the
record.
this
was
a
supposition
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
commonwealth
of
virginia.
the
record
was
that
it
was
stuck
in
the
wall.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
that
as
i
reads
--
read
silverman
where
the
test
--
the
new
test
being
one
of
this
--
reality
of
an
actual
intrusion,
if
it
shown
that
that
device
is
a
kind
that
can
reach
through
the
walls,
then
--
then
there
would
be
a
--
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
--
i
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
this
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
yes,
your
honor
but
still
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
they're
still
--
they're
still
deviated
from
the
previous
test
of
the
necessity
of
a
physical
trespass.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
well
that
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no,
i
--
i
agree
with
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
mr.
justice,
silverman
was
a
great
deal
more
gross
and
more
repulsive
than
the
instant
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
instant
case.
there
is
no
question
whether
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
is
not
--
there
was
not
a
--
trial
counsel
did
not
--
did
not
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
did
not
try
it,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no,
your
honor.
it
had
exactly
what
--
what
we
have
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
here.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
the
argument
of
counsel
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
the
argument
of
counsel
--
there
are
--
i
did
argue
it
there
and
i
did
argue
that
--
that
there
was
a
penetration
here
as
shown
by
the
record
of
a
party
wall,
of
a
device
designed
to
penetrate
electronically.
and
that
this
was
under
the
silverman
decision
and
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
neither
--
as
i
understand
it,
neither
counsel
on
appeal
had
ever
seen
the
device.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
--
we
--
i
did
not
have
the
device
and
of
course,
in
--
in
silverman,
there
was
a
--
the
opportunity
to
develop
how
this
was
--
was
utilized.
it
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
if
--
if
they
show
at
hand
definition
that
is
attached
to
this
microphone,
i
believe
the
silverman
case,
both
of
a
spike
device.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
--
yes,
sir.
i
would
suggest
that
it
would,
that
there
would
be
the
spike
on
the
end
designed
to
--
to
penetrate
into
the
wall.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
at
trial,
the
trial
counsel
did
object
to
it
on
the
grounds
of
the
fourth
amendment.
he
did
not
mention,
as
i
recall
the
record,
the
silverman
case
by
name
but
he
did
erred
a
dozen
objection
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
on
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
no.
if
--
we
do
have
the
police
officer's
testimony
on
page
21
that
the
device
right
above
the
question
of
spike
device,
the
sentence
says
in
the
last
clause,
"i
had
a
device
that
would
amplify
the
sound
so
that
you
can
hear
it
in
the
other
room."
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
but
this
is
the
merest
reference
to
silverman
as
i
read
the
record.
if
the
court
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
please
--
in
my
brief,
i
do
ask
the
court
to
--
it
defines
that
to
be
--
as
i
read
silverman.
but
it
that
does
not
present
this
new
test
of
an
actual
physical
intrusion
to
overrule
olmstead
which
originally
set
forth
this
test
of
an
actual
physical
trespass
to
constitute
a
--
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
admit
to
the
court
that
olmstead
is
advanced
with
other
cases
in
this
court
particularly
the
boyd
case
which
was
--
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
--
which
involved
the
custom's
laws.
and
if
the
district
attorney
filed
an
affidavit
suggesting
an
invoice,
what
--
what
was
on
it
if
the
defendant
didn't
turn
it
up
then
it
was
presumed
to
have
admitted
it.
now,
this
of
course
did
not
involve
a
physical
trespass.
in
gouled
versus
united
states
was
an
army
officer
and
a
friend
of
his
came
into
his
office
and
surreptitiously
took
a
piece
of
evidence.
and
again,
this
was
not
a
physical
trespass.
i
suggest
that
under
the
--
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
present
day
discovery
of
invention
that
olmstead
should
be
reversed
if
it
has
not
already
been
limited
by
silverman.
i
would
--
if
the
court
please
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
(inaudible)
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
i
would
be
delighted
to
send
it
up
here,
if
possible.
mr.
calvin
h.
childress
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
your
honors
the
question
of
the
evidence
relating
to
the
offense.
this
court
in
a
faye
decision
said
if
it
weren't
--
the
question
was
not
whether
there
was
other
evidence
sufficient
to
convict
but
whether
the
evidence
was
contributed
to
the
conviction
and
the
evidence
found
by
the
spike
mic
did
actually
contribute
to
this
conviction,
related
to
sounds
of
prostitution.
it
related
that
a
man
came
in
to
the
next
apartment
and
said
that
he
want
a
woman
in
his
apartment
and
catherine
clinton,
the
petitioner,
says,
"i'll
send
one
to
you."
now,
this
i
submit
is
where
a
material
and
does
go
to
the
question
of
whether
she
was
a
--
pondering
in
this
case
whether
she
took
money
without
a
--
with
consideration.
this
is
the
question
because
we
had
here
katherine
taylor,
the
main
prosecution
witness
who
admitted
to
previous
prostitution
and
admitted
that
she
was
living
illicitly
with
a
man
during
this
time.
and
the
question
was
whether
she
had
moved
up
in
the
ranks
of
the
working
girl
to
the
rank
of
management
for
which
case
katherine
clinton
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
this
offense.
and
as
to
the
evidence
--
as
to
the
spike
mic
your
honor,
fortunately,
i'll
be
happy
--
the
counsel
would
agree
to
have
it
send
up
here.
the
policeman
did
say
it
was
a
spike
device
and
it
was
stuck
in
the
wall
and
enabled
him
to
hear
sounds
in
the
other
room.
thank
you.
