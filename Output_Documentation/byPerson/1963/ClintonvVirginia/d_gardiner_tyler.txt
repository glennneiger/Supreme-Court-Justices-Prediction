mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
if
it
please
the
court.
we
maintain
here
the
fair
state
--
there
was
no
physical
invasion
or
inclusion
of
--
at
least
in
obtaining
the
evidence
objected
to
and
sought
to
be
excluded.
and
secondly,
there
was
no
unreasonable
search
as
condemned
by
the
fourth
amendment.
and
thirdly,
the
evidence
complained
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
conviction
of
the
defendant.
oh,
to
understand
the
case,
i
would
think
it
would
necessarily
give
you
some
point
of
background
as
to
what
--
why
the
officers
were
in
the
apartment.
this
thing,
i'm
making
a
(inaudible)
a
quasi
criminal
to
suggest
--
it
kind
of
hurts
me
because
they're
not.
in
other
words,
the
officers
there,
to
do
their
duty.
now,
the
duty
of
the
officers
there
was
to
watch
the
apartment,
put
the
woman
under
surveillance
by
the
law
of
a
police
department.
now,
the
--
the
evidence
is
amply
clear
here
that
she
had
--
that
--
of
a
reputation
in
the
community,
what
she
was
doing
now
for
years
and
years
and
the
officer
in
the
surveillance
appears
they
--
he
didn't
get
into
car
at
all.
he
stayed
in
asleep
in
this
car
and
watching
the
apartment.
what
did
he
observe?
observed
the
parents
of
the
defendant
there,
with
her
husband
from
time
to
time
and
they
tried
to
kill
men
and
women,
the
young
women
and
men.
it
added
to
the
--
in
another
feature,
they
found
that
the
--
the
apartment
was
rented
by
the
defendant
in
a
false
name,
in
other
words,
in
another
name.
they
didn't
disclose
their
real
name.
so
honestly,
from
the
very
beginning,
the
--
what
the
officers
knew
there,
this
woman
was
operating
this
house
of
prostitution
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
renting
the
apartment.
she
lived
elsewhere
in
norfolk.
she
maintained
a
whole
(inaudible).
and
she
used
--
and
she
rented
this
apartment
for
the
sole
purpose
of
operating
a
house
of
prostitution.
now,
it's
come
to
the
honorable
court
to
relieve
them
the
responsibility
of
that
crime.
your
honor,
if
it
please
your
honor,
the
police
department
violated
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
they
get
around
it
like
this.
this
thing,
that
certain
evidence
obtained
by
the
police
officer
should
be
excluded.
now,
i
think
the
court
should
--
should
have
some
idea
what
that
evidence
was.
was
it
material?
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
the
account
on
which
she
was
found
guilty?
now,
she
was
--
she
would
--
this
woman
was
charged
in
the
indictment,
two
counts.
one
count
was
the
--
count
number
one
was
a
violation
of
section
208
or
18.228
of
the
code
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
obtain
money
from
a
prostitute.
a
female
engaged
in
the
occupation
of
prostitution.
the
other
count
was
pleasing
a
female
in
a
house
of
prostitution.
separate
sections
of
the
code
of
virginia,
separate
crimes.
and
the
one
in
which
she
was
found
guilty
was
the
one
that
according
to
the
determination
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
was
that
statute
that
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
person
to
obtain
money
from
a
prostitute.
share
in
this
--
no
question
about
the
--
of
the
guilt
there.
the
--
the
reason
that
--
the
--
that
the
termination
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
in
that
and
this
isn't
the
--
the
penalty
proscribed.
the
jury
gave
her
a
$500
fine
and
five
years
in
--
in
the
penitentiary.
the
--
of
the
youth
--
the
penalty
of
both
operating
in
the
house
of
prostitution
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
minimum
fine
of
a
$1000
and
the
--
i
think
a
maximum
10-year
imprisonment.
obviously,
she
wasn't
found
guilty
of
that
by
the
jury,
affirmed
by
the
trial
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
stated
that
in
the
--
in
it
--
in
the
--
in
the
record
here.
there's
no
question
about
that.
so,
we
can
hear
--
that's
found
on
--
that's
found
on
pages
44
of
the
40
--
40
--
page
40.
they
call
--
virginia
says
the
jury
found
defendant
guilty
as
charged
under
the
first
count
and
fixed
her
punishment
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$500.
now,
the
evidence
sought
to
be
excluded
and
i
have
put
it
on
in
--
in
the
brief
here,
the
appendix
of
the
brief.
and
i
have
--
the
evidence
that
was
sought
to
be
excluded
was
that
this
--
the
conversations
that
this
officer
beach
heard.
what
did
they
amount
to?
did
they
amount
to
anything?
did
they
show
that
this
woman
violated
this
--
the
law
by
obtaining
money
from
a
prostitute?
and
then
the
--
the
indictment
named
the
prostitute,
katherine
r.
taylor.
katherine
r.
taylor
isn't
mentioned
in
the
converse
--
in
the
conversation
or
what's
heard.
there's
nothing
mentioned
in
the
conversations
that
the
--
the
woman,
the
defendant
obtained
money
from
a
prostitute.
so
there
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
but
because
she
was
charged
with
the
other
count
your
honor.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
the
--
if
that
was
the
reason
that
it
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
on
two
counts.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
it
was
a
--
there
was
a
general
verdict.
the
jury
said,
we
so
found
--
it
was
an
--
in
general
verdict
and
as
you
know,
this
court
has
held
a
number
of
cases
and
there's
enough
--
there's
a
--
to
the
effect
that
where
one
count
is
good
is
no
--
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
the
other
counts
(inaudible)
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
well,
except
--
except
--
the
jury
found
the
--
the
--
it
--
it's
determined
--
it's
determined
by
the
--
the
penalty
assessed
by
the
jury.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
find
her
guilty
of
the
--
the
operating
of
the
border
house
or
the
house
of
prostitution,
the
minimum
penalty
would've
--
have
to
--
been
$1000
fine
and
a
jail
--
a
sentence
for
a
sum
of
up
to
$10,000.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
--
would
have
to
be
$10
fine.
that
was
the
minimum,
you
see,
a
fare
--
the
$10
fine
was
a
minimum.
so
obviously
--
the
jury
did
not
--
in
--
in
asserting
the
fine,
$100
fine,
did
not
assess
the
--
did
not
find
her
guilty
of
the
other.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
it
couldn't
be
argued.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
--
that
--
that
also
provided
for
in
this
section
that
makes
it
unlawful
to
--
to
obtain
money
from
a
prostitute.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
the
statutes
are
--
i'll
set
forth
the
statute
in
the
appendix
in
the
brief,
you
can
just
glance
over
it
if
you
want
to
see
that
winning
goal,
and
finally
what
they
really
say,
i
have
summarized
it
for
you.
for
be
there
as
it
may,
i
--
i
want
to
talk
about
the
--
if
you
--
the
--
that
is
what
this
issue
is
whether
the
evidence
should
be
excluded.
that's
what
--
that's
the
motion
that
was
made
to
the
trial
court
and
that's
the
motion
that
was
--
that
was
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
invalid.
now,
going
to
the
--
the
other
--
the
other
--
this
position
that
is
really
taken
here
by
the
appellant,
the
evidence
doesn't
sustain
this
position.
he
--
he
says
that
the
--
there
was
a
--
there
was
an
intrusion
here
of
trespass
committed
or
an
unlawful
search
by
means
of
this
device
spike.
but
whatever
it
was,
that
the
--
the
--
as
the
--
as
the
court
understands
now,
the
--
the
mic
wasn't
described,
or
the
instrument
wasn't
described
in
a
way
it
always
just
to
(inaudible)
--
it
was
--
it
was
stated
that
it
was
a
small
device
used
to
pick
up
these
conversations.
and
i
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
use
the
term
spike.
i
would
put
into
his
--
into
it
--
into
a
--
notify
the
--
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
representatives
or
was
this
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes,
a
small
device.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
that's
right.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes,
sir.
but,
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
infer
from
that
that
it
was
the
same
--
the
same
characteristics
that
the
spike
might
have
in
the
--
in
the
silverman
case.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes,
in
fact
that
one
is.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
no
sir.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
no,
sir
because
it
--
you'd
have
to
show
--
the
evidence
would
have
to
show
that
the
--
the
spike
went
--
and
factually
in
--
into
the
--
into
the
premises
of
the
--
of
the
defendant.
that's
what
the
court
is
talking
about
there.
the
fraction
of
the
instant
means
a
physical
fraction
of
an
instance
because
the
court
very
clearly
in
the
--
in
the
silverman
case,
used
this
language.
for
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
in
this
case,
shows
that
the
eavesdropping
was
accomplished
by
means
of
unauthorized
physical
penetration
into
the
premises
occupied
by
petitioner.
and
the
turnover
to
the
--
you
can
see
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
clark
and
mr.
justice
whittaker.
they
say
this,
"in
view
of
the
determination
by
the
majority
that
the
unauthorized
physical
penetration
into
the
petitioner's
premises
constitutes
sufficient
trespass
to
remove
this
case
of
the
coverage
of
errant
decisions,
we've
--
we
are
obliged
to
join
in
the
court's
opinion.
and
what
else
did
--
and
after
that
case,
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
lopez
case
last
june,
mind
you,
used
this
language
to
the
lopez
case,
didn't
have
a
--
it
didn't
have
a
spike
mic
but
it
had
a
little,
a
little
device
in
the
pocket
of
a
detective,
they
picked
up
the
sound
while
he
was
there
interviewing
this
man.
now,
what
did
the
lopez
case
state?
see,
i
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
no
sir.
i
did
not.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
i
--
i
assume
it
could
be
if
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
present
here
in
--
in
the
court
here,
he
could
tell
you
better
than
i
could.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
i
don't
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
i
don't
think
i
could
agree
with
anything
else
(inaudible)
--
i
mean
i
like
to
do
it.
i
would
like
to
do
it.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
i
would
like
to
do
it
but
i
--
i
just
can't.
i
can't
agree
to
--
to
permit
that
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
--
that
the
thing
out
of
the
record,
i
mean
that's
all
--
is
the
--
we
--
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
stand
--
draw
a
line
somewhere
or
maybe
some
--
or
the
things
in
the
--
not
in
the
record
but
if
the
commonwealth
would
like
to
put
into
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
but
if
he
will
--
well,
if
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
if
the
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
(inaudible)
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
well,
wouldn't
it
be
on
a
--
when
--
when
you
have
to
have
other
evidence
besides
that
little
--
if
you
want,
(inaudible).
wouldn't
you
have
to
have
the
--
a
description
of
the
wall.
how
--
i
don't
think
it
was
the
wall?
was
it
--
was
it
six
inches
or
was
it
a
foot
or
was
it
10
feet.
in
other
words
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
that
would
be
very
material,
we're
talking
about
the
spike.
if
the
spike
was
just
inches
long,
three
inches,
and
the
wall
was
more
than
that.
you
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
--
one
--
one
could
go
through
them.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
well,
i
(inaudible)
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
i
won't
let
--
well,
i'll
ask
--
to
comply
to
the
court's
request
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
(inaudible),
but
i
do
think
we
only
have
the
description
of
the
wall
at
the
same
time
as
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
no,
i
didn't.
nobody
saw
it.
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
the
--
no,
no
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
no,
the
--
the
evidence
is
--
no
one
has
seen
it.
the
judge
--
the
judge
had
the
same
thing
that
you
--
that
the
court
has
here.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
because
there's
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
yes.
two
different
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
well
that
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
the
--
the
first
--
the
first
count
--
the
first
count
was
this.
from
page
--
on
--
mr.
d.
gardiner
tyler
they'd
be
punished
by
a
fine
not
less
than
$1000.
not
less
than
$1000
and
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
of
not
less
than
one
year
or
more
than
10
years.
that
was
the
one
that
--
that
was
the
second
count.
now,
the
--
the
count
that
she
was
found
guilty
of,
in
other
words,
that
obtaining
a
money
from
a
prostitute,
it
said
this.
she'll
be
con
--
confined
in
the
penitentiary
of
not
less
than
one
year
or
more
than
10
years
and
fine
not
more
than
$500.
(inaudible)
it
--
i
want
to
say
this,
there's
been
a
--
a
privilege
to
be
before
this
honorable
court,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
consideration
extended
and
its
been
an
honor
to
represent
my
state
of
--
state
of
virginia.
