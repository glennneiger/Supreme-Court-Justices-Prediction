justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
childress,
at
31,
which
it
refers
to
says
spike
device,
just
a
small
device.
this
spike
device,
in
any
sense,
a
work
of
art
in
this
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
we
have
the
actual
device
and
run
along
--
well,
i
don't
know
how
long
it
was.
there
was
a
spike
obviously
been
used
to
a
circuit.
the
device
at
the
end
of
it
was
a
--
was
a
hearing
device.
what
i'm
wondering
is,
is
this
a
--
in
that
expression
spike
device,
is
that
suppose
to
give
us
a
picture
of
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
recall
--
or
do
you
know
whether
--
even
counsel
at
the
trial
mention
the
silverman
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
can't
suppose
that
the
use
by
this
court
of
the
expression
spike
device
in
silverman
necessarily
was
--
before
them
in
--
at
the
trial.
you
can't
suppose
that,
is
that
it?
