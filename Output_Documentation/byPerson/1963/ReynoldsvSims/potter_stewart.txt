mr.
pitts,
going
back
to
justice
harlan's
question
of
--
a
moment
ago,
go
into
the
basic
--
basic
question
before
we
get
to
the
matter
of
remedy,
the
basic
question
of
constitutional
violation
here
as
i
--
as
i
understood
him,
justice
harlan
suggested
that
the
basic
argument
on
--
for
you
to
make
was
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
but
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
of
july
21st,
1962.
that
argument
is
--
is
not
open
to
you
unless
i
misread
it
or
unless
the
court
here
is
misstating
the
fact
and
i'm
quoting
from
144
of
the
record
where
the
court
says,
"it
has
been
generally
conceded
throughout
this
litigation
by
all
the
parties
that
the
present
apportionment
for
both
houses
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
alabama
constitutes
invidious
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
is
that
factually
untrue
or
is
it
true?
that
the
statement
as
to
the
concession
by
all
the
parties.
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
the
great
constitutional
issue
at
this
time
that
concessions
of
lawyers,
concessions
of
parties,
the
views
of
the
lower
court
while
there
--
of
course
title
of
the
greatest
respect
are
not
the
element
or
the
basis
in
which
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
not
bound
by
a
court's
concessions
in
constitutional
cases
but
as
i
--
i'm
only
suggesting
that
that
issue
wasn't
even
litigated
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
--
it
seems
so
clear
to
everybody
that
that
--
that
the
issues
before
the
court
required
different
issues,
i.e.
as
to
what
the
remedy
should
be.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
while
you're
on
the
subject
–
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
your
state
constitution,
i
wonder
if
you
can
tell
me
the
meaning
of
the
--
i'm
now
referring
to
section
284
of
article
18
of
the
1901
constitution
which
says
as
you
just
told
us
that
representation
in
a
legislature
shall
be
based
upon
population.
now,
--
now
here's
my
question,
“and
such
basis
of
representation
shall
not
be
changed
by
constitutional
amendments,”
is
this
--
what's
this
--
what
is
the
effect
of
this
one
in
your
state
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
can
any
constitution
which
is
subject
to
amendment
provide
that
this
part
of
the
constitution
is
not
so
bad?
justice
potter
stewart
aside
from
political
realities,
it's
your
position
that
even
if
it
were
done
that
the
resulting
reinforcement
would
still
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
the
provision
itself
said
that
it
simply
shall
not
be
changed
by
constitutional
amendments?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anybody.
i
assume
that's
what
it
purports
to
say.
that
was
the
basis
of
my
question
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
difficulty
with
the
first
branch
of
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
with
respect
to
the
1901
constitutional
provision
affecting
the
state
senate
is
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
construed
the
constitutional
provision
to
mean
something
other
than
what
you're
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
construed
to
mean
as
i
understand
it
that
there
should
be
one
--
no
more
than
one
senator
in
any
county.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we
bound
by
that
as
a
matter
of
accepting
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
we
--
this
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
this
has
been
clearly
construed
to
mean
what
i
say,
this
could
--
this
rather
ambiguous
language
of
your
constitution
has
been
construed
in
your
state
to
mean,
no
more
that
one
senator
from
any
counties.
is
that
right
or
not
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
the
judiciary
has
spoken
--
justice
potter
stewart
though
in
practice
as
well
as
in
talk,
that's
the
way
it's
been
construed.
justice
potter
stewart
no
county
could
have
more
than
one.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
--
just
before
we
recessed
to
the
lunch,
you
said
that
you
were
made
various
efforts
of
--
in
the
legislature
of
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
the
last
thing
you
said
was
that
you
urged
the
governor
to
veto
the
--
what
do
you
call
the
crawford
bill
and
to
amend
--
to
amend
the
legislature,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
provision
means
in
effect
that
the
governor
has
a
substantial
amount
of
potential
legislative
power,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
talking
veto,
speaking
veto.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
a
negative
kind
of
protection
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
to
multiply
its
committee
assignment
0.70?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you?
an
election
was
held
in
1952.
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
court
order.
i
mean,
in
conformity
with
the
--
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
apportionment
as
to
--
as
decree
by
this
--
by
this
district
court's
decree,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
an
election
made
conformity
with
that.
now,
what
are
the
terms
of
the
legislature?
how
long
are
they
going
to
serve
--
is
that
legislature
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
four
years
and
both
house
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
both
house
and
senate.
justice
potter
stewart
well
are
there
--
are
there
any
states
which
in
fact
have
governors'
counsels
which
are
appointive
rather
than
elective
and
which
have
--
a
considerable
legislative
power?
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
i
--
i
don't
know
--
but
knowing
with
the
states,
would
many
of
them
have
governor's
counsels
or
they're
called
by
various
names
with
more
or
less
a
political
power,
i
think
legislative
power?
justice
potter
stewart
could
a
state
--
could
a
state
under
the
constitution
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
say
we're
not
going
to
have
any
--
any
--
any
legislative
assembly.
we're
going
to
give
all
of
our
legislative
power
to
the
governor?
justice
potter
stewart
but
presumably
under
--
under
gray
against
sanders,
it
would
be
a
statewide
general
election
for
the
governor.
justice
potter
stewart
every
persons
vote
counting
equally,
every
qualified
voter's
vote
counting
equally.
do
you
think
under
the
constitution
the
--
the
state
could
have
--
say
you
have
all
the
legislative
power
and
all
the
executive
power
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
be
the
perfect
setup
for
a
--
for
a
legislative
assembly
all
of
them
to
be
elected
at
large?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you'd
probably
have
(voice
overlap)
all
of
them
--
all
of
them
representing
a
couple
of
big
counties.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
those
rural
legislators
more
truly
represent
some
of
the
voters
in
birmingham
than
do
the
(voice
overlap)
their
own
representative.
justice
potter
stewart
a
legislature,
a
--
an
individual's
legislator
has
a
constituency
which
is
not
statewide.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he's
not
a
--
a
statewide
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
within
any
given
constituency
and
in
that
case,
it
was
just
the
state
one.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
one
or
more
representatives
and
they
--
they
--
who
are
responsible
to
your
constituency.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
it
does
seem
to
be
though

general.
i
should
change
it.
i'm
leading
from
the
footnote

at
the
bottom
of

the
very
last
sentence.
a
clause
after
semi-colon,
you
said
that
the
state's
own
interpretation
leads
to
the
contrary,
that
is

own
interpretation
is
that
there
should
be
no
more
than

in

one

justice

and
you
claim
they're
controlling
now,
if
you
change
that
view
as
to
which

as
to
