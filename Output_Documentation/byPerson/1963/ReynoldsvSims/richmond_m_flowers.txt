mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
--
if
it
pleases
the
court.
the
former
attorney
general
of
alabama
was
a
party
to
this
suit.
as
i
understand,
he
was
brought
in
because
of
some
ministerial
duty
that
he
had
in
canvassing
votes.
naturally,
he
was
brought
in
along
with
some
other
public
officials
in
order
for
this
suit
to
develop
to
--
for
the
action
and
alike.
the
former
attorney
general
did
not
appeal
this
decision.
thus,
i
am
here
today
as
his
successor.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
citizen
or
an
official
of
alabama
that
could
argue
under
any
shadow
of
fairness
or
justice
that
apportionment
of
the
legislature
of
alabama
under
the
1901
constitution
as
it
is
here
today
or
as
when
this
suit
started
is
anything
but
unfair,
unjust
and
even
approaches
the
ridiculous.
on
occasions,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
even
recognized
this
fact.
now,
we
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
lower
court
has
taken
jurisdiction.
now,
as
stated
in
our
brief,
we
argue
under
the
presumption
that
baker
versus
carr
will
not
be
overturned
in
that
event,
or
in
case
baker
versus
carr
were
overturned
or
were
considered,
we
would
want
or
expect
or
ask
another
day
in
court,
but
we
argue
here
today
under
the
presumption
that
it
will
not
be
overturned.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
have
served
a
term
in
the
state
senate
of
alabama
before
--
naturally
before
i
became
attorney
general
of
that
state.
i
represented
and
this
maybe
peculiar
in
that
i
represented
a
two-county
district.
my
home
county
which
was
the
most
underrepresented
county
in
the
house
of
representatives;
the
most
--
houston
county,
the
most
underrepresented
county
in
the
state.
i
also
represented
an
adjoining
county
as
its
senator,
henry
county
which
is
the
second
most
overrepresented
county
in
the
state
of
alabama.
if
you
gentlemen
will
admit,
that's
a
good
job
for
one
man
to
do.
now,
in
my
home
county
of
some
50,000
people
slightly
over,
we
have
one
member
of
the
house.
we
share
the
senator
with
henry
county
who
had
something
over
13,000
people;
they
have
two
members
of
the
house.
now,
they
were
only
surpassed
by
one
other
county,
lowndes
county
and
being
more
overrepresented
than
they.
lowndes
has
slightly
over
13,000
people,
they
had
two
members
of
the
house
but
they
had
a
senator
to
themselves.
so
as
you
can
see,
the
apportionment
under
the
1901
constitution
at
time
they
started
approaches
the
absolute
ridiculous.
i
argue
not
as
to
the
validity
or
just
how
just
or
fair
it
was
in
1901
because
in
1901,
my
home
county
of
houston
did
not
even
exist.
we
were
born
after
the
adoption
of
1901
constitution.
after
the
lower
court
took
jurisdiction,
then
the
legislature
passed
some
acts
that
the
three-judge
district
court
said
were
not
acceptable.
so
they
then
wrote
a
temporary
measure
as
i
understand
they
said
it
was
as
temporary
measure
that
would
serve
until
the
legislature
had
passed
a
bill
that
was
adequate.
now,
the
legislature
has
met
and
failed
to
act,
i
realized.
however,
there
are
reasons
for
that
action
and
i
shall
cover
that
later,
but
first
let
me
state
that
i
very
strongly
join
the
doubts
that
may
exist
here,
if
any,
that
a
call
for
general
standards
to
be
laid
down
in
all
cases
or
in
all
states,
i
believe
that
to
be
unsound.
now
while
apologizing
for
not
knowing
the
workings
or
the
alleged
troubles
of
the
other
states,
i
here
today
represent
as
i
say,
the
state
of
alabama
and
i
strongly
feel
since
i
have
actually
engaged
in
these
legislative
facts,
i
strongly
feel
that
our
problem
lies
on
having
the
one
question
answered
whether
the
alabama,
whether
alabama
can
meet
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
state
constitutional
provisions,
under
our
state
constitutional
provisions
providing
for
reapportionment.
for
instance,
as
you
gentlemen
well
know,
we
have
one
section
of
our
constitution
of
states
that
our
house
shall
be
based
on
a
population
basis
and
shall
be
limited
to
105
members
giving
any
new
county
that's
formed
after
the
adoption
the
constitution
on
additional
member
that's
the
reason
our
present
house
consists
of
106
members.
we
had
one
county
--
my
county,
the
baby
county,
houston
to
be
formed
since
the
1901
constitution.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
i
think
it
was
well
expressed
in
the
new
york
case
yesterday,
mr.
justice.
that
allows
a
handful
of
people
too
lock
themselves
into
the
legislature
and
hold
control
to
the
legislative
body
of
alabama.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
as
a
member
of
the
state
senate,
we
propounded
to
the
supreme
court,
an
opinion
of
the
justice
on
that
particular
point
and
we
receive
one
saying
that
it
could
not
be
changed.
to
me
it's
ridiculous
but
that's
their
answer.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
in
1955,
we
introduced
resolutions
in
both
houses
calling
for
a
constitutional
convention.
in
our
35-man
senate,
we
mustered
16
votes
to
cast
for
a
constitutional
convention
and
it
frightened
that
group
so
badly
that
when
it
came
up
in
the
house
of
106
members,
it
only
got
eight
votes.
they
got
more
votes
in
the
senate
than
they
got
in
the
house.
gentlemen,
i
have
struggled
and
fought
in
these
legislative
battles
for
reapportionment
and
i'm
going
to
cover
that
a
little
bit
in
just
my
last
few
remaining
minutes.
but
this
question
of
whether
under
our
constitution,
whether
under
our
constitution
we
can
meet
the
provisions,
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
--
as
for
instance
i
say
one
section
says
that
our
house
shall
be
based
on
a
population
basis,
shall
be
limited
to
105
members,
with
one
new
member
for
each
county,
then
at
the
same
time,
it
gives
each
county
at
least
one
house
member.
so
this
should
be
placed
on
a
population
basis
and
in
times
right
around
gives
every
county
67
we
have
or
house
member
then
in
our.
another
section,
limits
the
senate
to
35
members.
the
state
practices
and
policies
supported
by
--
even
supported
by
arguments
in
the
constitutional
convention
established
the
fact
that
no
county
shall
have
more
than
one
senator.
there
has
been
some
doubt
and
some
have
advanced
the
arguments
that
under
the
section
that
says
no
county
shall
be
divided
between
two
districts.
through
the
--
through
the
years,
no
county
has
had
more
than
one
senator
and
i
think
that
was
the
intention
of
that
particular
section
that
they
should
not.
there
have
been
arguments
advanced
that
this
mean
you
couldn't
take
part
of
a
county
and
take
it
on
another
one,
that's
not
our
decision
here
today,
but
some
have
argued
that
you
could
have
districts
within
a
county.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
no
sir.
i
believe
it's
physically
impossible
that
--
it's
politically
impossible
for
the
legislature
to
reapportion
itself
under
the
1901.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
because
they
--
there
are
just
a
handful
of
people
have
gained
control
of
the
legislature
and
naturally
it's
hard
to
ask
a
man
to
vote
himself
out
that.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
no,
sir.
the
three-judge
district
court
now
has
intimated
and
in
their
language
they
said
that
--
that
our
apportionment
could
be
done
on
a
population
basis
to
some
extent.
of
course,
now
i
realize
we
approached
a
twilight
zone
when
we
say
"to
some
extent,"
but
if
you
affirm
this
and
i
saw,
i
engaged
in
the
fights
and
although
i
was
not
in
the
last
in
the
session
that
actually
reapportioned,
i
was
there
and
i
saw
men
struggling,
wanting
this
question
answer,
whether
even
if
they
did
this
and
so
would
it
answer
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
they
were
unable
to
get
that
answer.
and
under
our
provisions,
if
you
feel
or
you
affirm
or
take
the
attitude
of
the
three-judge
district
court
in
saying
yes
to
some
extent
you
can
and
i
believe
the
legislature
can
and
will
forward
under
the
direction
of
the
lower
court
it
would
be
you
pleasure
but
i
believe
they
can
and
will
move
forward
to
make
--
because
otherwise,
some
of
our
constitutional
provisions
have
to
fall
and
it's
--
it's
my
opinion
that
--
my
observation
that
this
court
does
means
backward
to
keep
from
knocking
down,
constitutional
--
state
constitutional
provisions,
and
if
it
be
your
attitude
or
your
decision
that
some
of
our
one
or
more
of
our
provisions
have
to
fall
under
the
direction
of
the
lower
court
if
it
be
you
will
let
our
legislature
reapportion
and
then
in
that
way,
let
them,
our
people
decide
which
must
fall
or
what
they
should
resubmit
to
the
people
in
the
place
of
them.
that
--
that
would
put
it
back
to
the
state
legislature
of
alabama.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
without
--
without
their
action,
but
is
in
--
it
is
my
sincere
conviction
that
this
one
question
was
--
what
through
loggerheads
in
that
pipe
because
i
stood
down
on
the
floor
and
watched
them,
was
whether
or
not,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
would
our
provisions
fit
under
that?
would
they
meet
it?
would
they
answer
the
equal
protection
clause?
this
division
of
the
house
and
the
division
of
the
senate,
the
way
we
have
it.
even
if
we
put
it
as
the
district
court
said
"to
some
extent"
and
i
would
agree
with
the
counsel
before
me
that
alabama
is
peculiar
and
that
it
is
heavily
sectionalized
and
it's
an
economic
thing.
it's
not
just
the
geography,
it's
sectionalized
economically
and
the
tennessee
valley,
the
industrial
area
of
birmingham,
the
black
belt
and
the
good
wild
grass
are
that
we
call
it
was
ignored
by
previous
council.
the
port
area
of
the
mobile,
it
is
heavily
sectionalized
and
i
think
it
could
be
districted
in
certain
way
--
in
such
a
way
that
we
were
allowed
to
say
to
some
extent
that
it
could
be
done
where
most
everyone
would
be
happy
with
what
we
have.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes,
sir.
because
i
cannot
see
the
legislature,
i
stood
five
days
and
nights
in
the
sustained
filibuster
where
the
preponderance
of
the
state
senate
voting
for
supporting
reapportionment
in
alabama
to
absolutely
no
avail.
also,
i
was
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
when
the
suit
was
filed
and
the
district
refused
to
take
jurisdiction
and
every
bill
that
was
introduced
in
every
way
failed.
they
absolutely
refused
the
few
people
have
to
control
they
would
not
vote
themselves
out.
as
our
populations
grew
and
as
withdrew
their
strength
became
more
and
more
and
more.
then
when
the
--
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes,
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
with
the
exception
of
this
one
question
and
maybe
we
do
not
have
it
in
but
if
you
could
answer
for
them,
whether
or
not,
alabama
can
meet
the
equal
protection
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
state
constitution
--
constitutional
provisions
that
we
have
providing
reapportionment.
if
they
can,
i
think
under
the
court’s,
the
lower
court's
guidance,
i
think
the
legislature
of
alabama
could
now
direct
themselves.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir,
whether
they
meet
--
whether
they
meet
the
provision.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
it
was
embraced
in
our
brief,
on
page
5.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
if
we
can
--
you
see
the
three-judge
district
panel
said
that
they
felt
they
could
to
some
extent.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
that
could
be
some
questions,
there
have
been.
in
fact
every
time
the
legislator
meets
and
attempts
to
put
out
a
constitutional
amendment
to
the
people
the
67-senator
bill
has
been
put
out
and
soundly
defeated
three
times.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
yes
sir.
i
fought
those
fights
through
the
night.
alabama
needs
reapportionment,
alabama
doesn't
have
reapportionment.
and
alabama
--
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
before
they
took
action,
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
violated
the
alabama
constitution.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
the
1901
constitution,
the
apportionment
that
they
had.
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
oh
you
mean
the
10-year
refusal?
well,
of
course
yes
sir,
yes
sir
absolutely,
i
do.
that
they're
refusing,
they're
refusing
to
act
--
i
don't
know
that
that
negates
the
constitution
but
they
certainly
didn't
follow
the
constitution
and
continually
refused
to
follow
it.
it
wasn't
an
oversight
--
mr.
richmond
m.
flowers
i
think
it's
just
a
poor
substitute.
it
wasn't
to
my
liking,
better
than
what
we
have,
but
if
you
would
allow
it
to
move
on.
excuse
me
gentlemen,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
