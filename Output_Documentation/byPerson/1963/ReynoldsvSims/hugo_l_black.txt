justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask,
what
--
if
you
were
to
win
your
contention,
what
would
be
the
practical
result
in
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
--
what
would
be
the
result
with
reference
to
the
present
members
of
the
state
senate
in
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
that
are
now
the
members
of
the
legislature
in
the
state
senate.
if
you
win,
are
they
properly
elected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
it's
practical
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
practical
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
practical
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
win
--
if
you
win
your
contention,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
is
the
result
with
reference
to
the
present
senate
of
the
legislature
of
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
if
--
if
you
would
then
return
in
your
elections
to
their
old
apportionment
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
mean
--
as
i
read
this,
i'm
not
sure
about
this
though,
that
the
senator
from
jefferson
county
where
birmingham
is
located
represents
634,000
while
one
senator
from
lowndes
county
represents
7000
or
15,417.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
is
that
--
what
--
what
would
be
the
result
if
you
win
your
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
could
happen
thereafter
but
what
do
we
return
to
you
if
you
succeed
in
--
in
validating
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
go
to
the
apportionment
as
it
has
been.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
return
to
the
apportionment
has
been
and
then
have
to
wait
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
have
to
wait
it
for
your
contention
for
action
in
alabama
about
a
vote
of
the
people
on
the
amendment
to
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
mean
time,
jefferson
county
would
be
entitled
of
the
population
of
6
--
650,000
to
one
sentence
and
lowndes
county
with
13,000
to
a
--
to
a
representation
of
one
sentence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
typical
throughout
the
state,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
the
practical
situation
in
which
the
court
had
to
meet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
had
your
used
claim,
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
and
shouldn't
have
done
it.
but
that's
the
practical
situation
it
had
to
meet
if
it
had
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
wouldn't
--
do
you
think
that
would
bind
the
people
of
state
of
alabama
if
they
wanted
to
adopt
the
provision
of
the
constitution
which
was
acquired
differently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
have
said
that
the
constitution
as
supposing
the
situation
in
the
state,
so
that
the
people
cannot
of
their
own
choice,
adopt
the
new
constitutional
provision
contrary
to
the
1901
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
--
do
you
have
that
opinion
and
in
what
part
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
says
to
withhold
from
the
legislature
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
constitutional
provision
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
in
a
regular
lawsuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
only
by
statement
by
the
judges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
statements
by
the
judges
in
answer
to
inquiry
under
the
statute
are
not
binding
as
court
decisions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
purely
voluntary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
way,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
way,
isn't
it,
that
the
court
originally
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
act
which
had
authorized
the
inquiries
to
be
made
on
the
court?
they
sustained
it,
did
they
not,
on
the
basis
that
it
would
not
be
binding
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
in
the
controversial
case
but
merely
the
individual
views
of
the
judges
would
voluntarily
gave
them.
