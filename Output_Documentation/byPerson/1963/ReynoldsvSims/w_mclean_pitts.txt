mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
with
great
humility
that
i
appear
before
this
court
in
view
of
some
of
the
propositions
that
we
are
going
to
make
to
this
court
in
behalf
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
i
will
briefly
go
through
some
of
the
--
the
points
that
lead
up
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
we'll
go
in
to
historically
a
little
of
the
alabama
history
relative
to
its
constitutional
convention,
the
acts
of
the
legislature
that
are
involved.
on
march
the
26th,
this
court
gave
the
--
handed
down
the
decision
of
baker
versus
carr
which
was
somewhat
a
radical
departure
from
the
cases
from
1803
to
1962.
baker
represents
neither
the
familiar
pattern
of
judicial
review
and
occasional
negation
of
particular
governmental
policies
nor
the
newer
pattern
in
some
of
the
desegregation
cases
of
impositions
of
--
it
is
to
act
or
rather
than
to
desist,
but
both
of
these
patterns
have
this
much
in
common.
they
leave
essentially
in
fact
the
distribution
and
possession
of
political
power
by
contrast.
it
is
my
position
that
baker
versus
carr
is
an
invitation
to
the
courts
to
sit
in
judgment
of
the
structure
of
political
power
even
to
the
effect
of
a
judicial
transfer
of
political
power.
before
the
ink
was
drawn
on
baker
versus
carr
decision
and
on
april
the
14th,
1962,
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
issued
its
ultimatum
to
the
alabama
legislature
that
it
must
reapportion
itself.
on
july
the
12th,
1962,
the
alabama
legislature
produced
two
bills.
one
of
them
was
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
bill
which
was
a
constitutional
amendment
that
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
of
alabama.
then
they
passed
the
webb-crawford
act
which
was
a
savings
act
that
would
have
reapportioned
the
1966
legislature
provided
that
people
of
alabama
to
hand
down
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
act
as
proposed.
on
july
the
25th,
13
days
after
the
passage
of
that
--
of
the
act,
of
these
two
acts,
the
federal
judge
of
the
district
court
declared
both
of
these
acts
unconstitutional.
and
in
their
decision,
they
took
the
senatorial
provisions
of
the
way
of
crawford
act
and
the
house
provisions
of
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
act
put
the
two
together
and
legislated
for
the
state
of
alabama.
now,
my
propositions
to
this
court
are
simply
that
the
legislative
reapportionment,
there
are
four
propositions
i
want
to
make
to
the
court.
one,
legislative
reapportionment
should
be
resolved
without
federal
interference.
the
court
should
reconsult
baker
versus
carr
or
clarify
baker
versus
carr
and
return
to
the
original
constitution,
proposition
that
courts
do
not
interfere
with
the
political
structure
of
states.
two,
the
courts
should
limit
themselves
under
the
time
honored
to
constitutional
provisions
for
checks
and
balances
to
the
function
of
judicial
review
of
legislative
acts.
they
should
not
invade
the
providence
of
the
legislature
whether
--
whether
it
is
done
by
exacting
new
laws
or
whether
it
is
done
by
a
veto
power.
three,
the
court
should
not
have
declared
in
that
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
alabama
which
by
the
acts
of
a
legislature
--
by
the
act
of
a
legislature
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
vote
of
the
people
of
alabama
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis.
four,
even
under
baker
versus
carr,
the
district
court
should
not
ever
retain
--
retained
jurisdiction
in
this
case
because
the
factual
situation
in
the
case
at
bar
is
different
from
the
facts
in
the
tennessee
case.
now,
in
order
for
you
gentlemen
to
understand
probably
my
argument,
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
the
constitutional
convention
of
1901.
that
convention
brought
together
delegates
in
montgomery,
alabama
who
have
been
recognized
as
the
greatest
minds
of
political
thoughts
and
lawyers
in
that
state.
they
came
up
and
as
--
as
i
heard
the
argument
of
the
new
york
case
yesterday,
it
brought
me
to
mind
in
reading
the
proceedings
of
the
1901
constitutional
convention
of
alabama.
that
practically,
every
point
that
was
made
before
this
court
about
the
distribution
of
political
power
and
districting
was
discussed
in
the
1901
constitutional
convention
of
alabama.
that
constitution
was
submitted
to
the
people
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis
and
was
adopted
by
the
people.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
sir?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
will
--
come
on
down
to
that
in
just
a
little
bit
of
reason.
i'm
getting
to
that
point.
in
deciding
to
--
in
--
in
arriving
at
this,
these
men
realized
the
great
geographical
distant
differences
that
exist
in
the
state
of
alabama.
alabama
is
a
state
of
great
natural
resources.
i'm
not
talking
for
the
chamber
of
commerce,
but
i'm
just
pointing
this
out
to
the
court.
across
the
center
of
the
state
around
the
birmingham
area,
we
have
steel
mills,
coal.
you
go
into
the
north
in
the
tennessee
valley,
you'd
run
into
the
great
farming
area,
of
course
now
you
run
into
the
hospitals
which
has
greatly
increased
in
population
recently.
then
in
the
south
it
was
not
in
this
middle
part
of
the
state
which
is
known
as
blytheville
which
i
am
from,
you'll
run
into
a
farm
and
in
rural
area
then
he
should
go
on
down
to
the
mobile,
you
run
into
the
waterfronts,
the
coastal
area
and
again
an
industrial
section.
all
of
these
were
kept
in
mind,
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
this
1901
constitutional
convention.
we
of
the
blytheville
recognize
that
there
was
malapportionment
in
the
alabama
legislature
in
1960
and
i'm
not
standing
before
this
court
in
saying
that
there
was
not
malapportionment
before
in
the
legislature
in
1960,
but
we
said
per
se
that
if
the
legislature
of
alabama
is
to
be
reapportioned,
then
it
should
be
reapportioned
by
the
legislature
of
alabama
and
not
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
we
waited
from
1901
to
1962,
mr.
justice
warren.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
but,
what
i
want
to
point
out
is
--
the
point
that
we
want
to
make
is
that
how
we
differ
in
the
tennessee
case
that
although
we
waited
from
1901
to
1962
when
the
district
court
issued
its
ultimatum
to
the
alabama
legislature,
they
acted
promptly
and
they
did
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
of
alabama
and
even
another
act
known
as
the
webb-crawford
act
which
is
a
savings
act
in
blytheville.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
sir,
but
i
want
to
point
out,
it's
my
position
in
this
was,
getting
back
to
the
point
of
baker
versus
carr,
which
i
believe,
that
under
several
declaratory
act,
i
believe
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
legislate
for
the
people
of
alabama.
you
again
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
yes.
now,
in
passed
--
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
1901,
the
legislature
was
set
up
so
that
that
would
be
as
house
and
a
senate,
not
more
than
35
senators
and
not
more
than
135
--
105
members
of
the
house.
then
they
proceeded
that
they
--
to
set
up
35
senatorial
districts
and
provided
that
each
senator
was
to
have
a
district.
then,
there's
another
provision
of
alabama
constitution
that
says
that
the
senate
--
senate
shall
not
consist
of
less
down
one-fourth
or
more
than
one-third
of
the
house
of
representatives.
the
house
of
representatives
should
consist
of
105
members,
each
county
shall
have
at
least
one
representative.
no
county
shall
be
divided
into
two
senatorial
districts
and
no
district
shall
be
made
up
of
two
or
more
districts
not
contiguous
to
each
other
and
those
are
the
provisions
in
the
alabama
constitution
that
the
legislature
was
confronted
with
every
time
it
would
start
to
reapportion.
there
have
been
--
been
many
--
many
others
bills
introduced,
but
those
were
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
1901
constitution
and
the
point
is
that
i'm
trying
to
make
this
court
that
it
is
not
on
a
population
basis.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
cites
percentages
and
figures
but
actually,
the
alabama
legislature
is
not
based
solely
on
a
population
basis.
it
is
based
on
an
area
basis
and
a
population
basis
so
that
no
geographical
section
of
the
state
would
have
a
stranglehold
on
the
alabama
legislature.
if
you
go
strictly
to
a
population
basis,
then
the
larger
are
--
for
these
populated
counties
would
have
a
stranglehold
on
the
alabama
legislature
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis
and
the
people
in
the
rural
areas
would
not
have
any
say
so
in
their
own
government.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
mr.
chief
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
--
justice
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
was
anticipating
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
there
are
times
that
i
see
under
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
where
the
court
could
declare
the
rights
but
the
courts
could
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
that's
my
answer.
i
think
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
i
think
it
would.
i
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
declare
it
but
i
don't
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
eventually
involve
the
state
of
alabama
or
the
people
of
alabama.
as
i
take
it,
baker
versus
carr
simply
said
that
the
federal
court
where
there
was
invidious
discrimination
existing
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
but
there
was
so
much
in
baker
versus
carr
that
was
left
unsaid
in
sort
of
guidelines
to
the
lower
courts
and
what
was
suggested
in
--
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
justices
have
thrown
the
lower
courts
into
the
midst
of
properly
a
political
pick
fight.
in
other
words,
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
suggested
there
that
--
for
in
--
the
--
that
one
of
them
was
that
actually
draw
new
legislative
boundaries
or
threatened
to
do
so
if
a
legislature
does
not
have
performed,
to
retain
jurisdiction
while
waiting
for
the
legislature
to
act
frequently
on
--
to
act
frequently.
one
of
those
two
things
is
about
the
only
thing
that
a
court
could
do
to
carry
out
baker
versus
carr
as
just
what
you
ask
me
as
i
see
it,
one
of
the
two
unless
they
proceed
to
legislate
for
the
legislature.
in
a
way,
the
court
sitting,
waiting
for
the
legislature
to
act
under
what
they
will
see
would
be
a
fair
apportionment
of
the
statute
or
redistricting
statute
would
be
a
veto
power
in
the
courts.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
no
sir.
i
don't
like
what
the
court
did
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
--
in
order
to
break
in
this
stranglehold
on
the
legislature
if
the
court
wanted
to
do
it.
i
think
that
in
election
at
large
if
the
court
didn't
act
but
i
don't
like
that
because
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
i
do.
as
i
just
said
i
think
that
the
--
that
--
that
power
of
veto
over
legislature
transcends
the
separation
of
power
doctrine
of
the
three
branches
of
government,
the
executive,
the
legislature
and
the
judicial.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
i
think
they
should.
i'm
arguing
its
--
that
they
should
reconsider
baker
versus
carr
and
as
i
read
and
i
said
that
that
would
raise
immunity
in
our
argument
of
this
court
at
that
point,
but
as
i
see
it,
it
is.
it
should
be
reconsidered
by
this
court.
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers
from
the
three
branches
of
american
government
transcends
what
equity
of
power
the
court
may
have
had
or
may
claim
in
order
to
step
in
and
draw
legislative
districts,
boundaries
even
if
the
legislature
disregards
their
responsibility.
this
principle
as
i
see
it
is
clear
in
the
study
of
the
notes
of
the
proceedings
of
the
1901
alabama
constitution
and
it
is
also
clear
in
the
notes
of
the
secret
debates
of
1787
constitutional
convention
and
in
this
first
congress,
this
point
--
these
three
branches
of
government
were
kept
to
speak
free
and
equal,
a
system
of
checks
and
balances.
in
government
--
in
going
further
and
granting
relief
in
the
form
and
borrowing
one
of
the
two
courses
and
granting
relief,
the
court
completely
notes
their
separation
of
facts
the
duals
and
the
dual
system
of
government
in
the
united
states.
i
think
it’s
out
contention
that
the
court
should
limit
themselves
under
this
time,
a
lot
of
the
constitutional
provisions
for
checks
and
balances
to
the
function
of
judicial
review
of
legislative
acts.
they
should
not
invade
the
legislative
functions
whether
it’d
be
done
by
enacting
new
laws
through
the
use
of
judicial
power
or
by
a
veto
of
the
legislature.
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
escape
that
pro
--
proposition.
i
have
carefully
read
every
word
in
baker
versus
carr
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
alabama
case,
i
think
that
the
alabama
case
is
entirely
different
from
any
of
the
other
apportionment
cases
that
are
pending
before
this
court.
the
alabama
case
is
the
extreme
that
a
court
can
go
whereas
the
new
york
case
that
was
argued
yesterday
is
the
other
end
of
the
extreme.
as
i
see
it,
it
points
out
these
--
what
a
terrible
situation
can
exist
from
baker
versus
carr.
now,
i
may
say
to
this
court
while
i
have
stood
here
before
you
and
told
you
that
i
would
argue
that
you
should
reconsider
baker
versus
carr.
second,
if
you
don't
reconsider
or
change
the
rule
in
baker
versus
carr,
you
have
got
to
give
some
guidelines
or
some
limitations
that
can
be
put
down
to
the
lower
courts
because
the
lower
courts
have
taken
the
decision
of
baker
versus
carr
as
an
invitation
to
them
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
legislature
of
the
various
states.
that
the
legislative
powers
of
the
people
can
be
organized
according
to
the
dictates
of
a
federal
judiciary
is
in
there
in
violation
that
the
government
shall
be
composed
of
the
executive
and
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches,
each
of
whom
exercise
separate
but
equal
power.
a
federal
judiciary
that
can
dictate
the
authorization
of
a
state
legislature
can
indirectly
and
i
think
this
is
important
and
it
is
set
out
in
our
brief,
that
they
can
indirectly
dictate
the
seats
of
the
house
of
representatives
or
--
or
district
--
in
a
redistrict
by
act
of
the
state
legislature.
legislative
reapportionment
should
be
resolved
without
federal
interference.
now,
the
case
at
bar
in
illustrating
of
the
confusion
that
can
result
and
from
--
by
the
federal
judiciary
barring
baker
versus
carr.
the
soundness
the
majority
opinion
has
been
questioned
by
members
of
the
bar,
the
courts
and
students
of
government
and
for
reasons
we
have
we
urge
that
you
reconsider
this
decision
in
that
--
and
return
to
the
original
constitutional
proposition.
as
i
just
pointed
out
to
you
the
range
of
action
in
these
federal
courts
and
the
lower
courts
has
been
wide.
within
six
months
after
baker
versus
carr,
suits
were
filed
in
31
states,
41
opinions
rendered
and
special
sessions
had
been
held
at
some
eight
states.
this
we
see
from
the
alabama
case
and
the
new
york
case,
we
can
see
the
wide
range
of
action
that
baker
versus
carr
has
called.
as
i
see
the
federal
court
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
mr.
justice
harlan
that
would
depend
upon
whether
there
can
be
found
anything
in
the
constitution.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
my
contention
that
baker
versus
carr
should
be
reconsidered,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
well
--
well
i'm
trying
to
point
out
--
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
in
answer
to
your
question
sir,
i'm
trying
to
answer
is,
that
if
there
is
foundation
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
what
the
federal
court
dictate
judicial
--
dictate
jurisdiction
then
if
they
had
malapportionment
in
the
alabama
legislature
and
it
amounts
to
invidious
discrimination,
then
the
federal
court
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
and
my
second
proposition
to
you
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
and
whether
or
not
what
alabama
has
done
comes
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
well
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
agree
with
your
opinion
and
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
come
under
it.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
but
we
also
say
that
even
if
it
does
come
under
it
and
even
if
baker
versus
carr
stands
and
if
the
court
has
that
the
federal
judiciary
in
montgomery
or
the
district
court
exceeded
its
authority
in
striking
down
a
constitutional
amendment
that
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
of
alabama
and
that
is
the
way
their
constitution
is
amended
except
unless
a
constitutional
convention
is
called.
my
contention
is
that
if
baker
versus
carr
does
even
in
view
of
baker
verus
carr
that
the
federal
court
did
not
have
the
right
to
go
as
far
as
it
went
in
the
alabama
case.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
sir.
alabama's
population
has
changed
greatly
in
the
last
--
since
1901
but
i
don't
say
that
there
is
discrimination.
i
think
that
alabama
has
a
rational
plan.
the
legislature
of
alabama
has
just
failed
to
act.
the
system
that
alabama
has
which
is
based
not
only
of
--
on
population
but
it
is
based
on
area.
so
i
say
that
--
that
is
not
discrimination,
it's
a
rational
plan
that
alabama
have
but
they
have
just
failed
to
act
or
the
legislature
had
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i'll
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
mr.
goldberg,
i
meant
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i'm
not
going
in
to
the
mathematics
of
the
situation.
i
don't
think
that
that
has
--
is
neither
here
nor
there
because
of
the
alabama
system,
but
i
do
sir
is
will
state
it
that
if
that
is
true,
it's
about
25%
i
would
say
that
maybe
more
than
that,
i
don't
know.
i
believe
it's
38%,
i
believe.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
44%
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
44%.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
and
it
dropped
down
now.
this
is
--
this
act
that
the
federal
court
has
got
it
--
brought
it
back
up
to
about
41%.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
about
3%
back
and
restored
it
back
to
the
1901
constitutional
convention,
i
mean
the
constitution.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
would
like
to
explain
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
did
not
participate
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
it's
in
the
record,
and
that
is
a
true
statement
in
the
record,
i
would
say
that
it's
true
that
that
was
conceded
by
the
parties
and
of
course
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
we
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
wasn't
even
litigated
in
the
whole
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
now
the
attorney
general
held
it,
who
the
--
in
the
lower
court,
(inaudible)
probate
judge
of
dallas
county
was
a
party
defendant.
that
is
--
we
got
in
the
case
after
the
court
had
decided
the
case
and
we
appealed
it
to
this
court.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
would
carry
out,
if
we
would
be
successful
with
appeal
then
the
constitutional
amendment
would
be
submitted
to
the
people.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
you
mean
in
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
bill?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
oh,
you
are
talking
about
the
legislature
of
alabama
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
--
that
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
--
has
taken
the
office
in
the
mean
time
and
in
--
where
i'm
in.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
under
the
federal
court
decree.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
now
in
my
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
think
that
was
a
de
facto
legislature
and
i
think
that
the
validity
of
that
act
would
be
determined
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
if
the
apportionment
act
stands
as
it
now
--
as
it
was
in
the
1901
constitution,
what
you
say
would
be
correct?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
and
this
amendment
will
appraise
to
the
people.
in
other
words
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
alright
sir.
i
think
that
you
return
to
the
--
to
the
constitutional
amendment,
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
bill.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
in
the
mean
time.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
until
that
6
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
would
--
i
would
say,
yes
from
that
day
is
malapportionment
in
alabama
legislature.
yes,
i
see
as
it
exists
before
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
bill
and
the
webb-crawford
act
was
passed.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
but
now
the
sixty
seventh
amendment
bill
would
have
been
submitted
to
the
people
immediately
because
of
the
election
coming
up.
and
if
it
had
passed,
you
would
have
had
apportionment
under
the
webb-crawford
act
which
boarded
back
near
about
to
where
the
44%
that
we
were
just
talking.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
well
now
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
will
read
from
the
webb-crawford
act,
--
that
was
the
sense
of
what
we
say.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
but
the
court,
you
were
speaking
of
the
senate.
now,
that
the
federal
district
court
took
the
senate
provisions
of
the
webb-crawford
act.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
and
that's
one
of
active
point,
yes.
i
will
--
we
contend
and
i
want
to
make
this
statement
before
and
i
see
that
my
time
is
about
up,
if
this
three-judge
federal
district
court
decision
and
this
case
is
allowed
to
stand,
we
say
that
then
alabama
and
our
sister
states
have
been
deprived
of
the
last
vestiture
of
state
sovereign.
they
are
no
longer
sovereign
state.
if
the
federal
judiciary
considers
all
with
the
legislature
of
a
state,
and
vetoed
acts
of
that
legislature
and
say
that
that
legislature
cannot
submit
to
the
people
of
that
state
a
constitutional
amendment
to
their
own
constitution,
then
i'll
say
that
there's
no
longer
a
sovereign
state.
i
will
retain
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
--
and
this
with
infamous
argument
for
which
in
counsel
and
i
must
--
trying
to
this
proposition,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
this
is
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
harlan,
which
i
view
the
same
way
in
which
he
asked
before.
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
or
else
where
in
the
federal
constitution
could
expressly
or
impliedly
supports
the
view
that
state
of
legislature
must
be
so
contracted
as
to
let
with
approximate
equality
of
the
force
are
irrevocable,
not
only
is
that
proposition
hinted
by
history
but
it
strikes
deep
into
the
heart
of
our
federal
system.
its
acceptance
would
require
us
to
turn
our
backs
on
the
regard
which
this
court
had
always
shown
with
the
judgment
of
state
legislators
and
courts
all
matters
basically
of
local
concern.
now,
that
was
--
that
was
mr.
justice
harlan's
--
taken
from
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
in
baker
versus
carr,
which
is
our
position
in
this
case
here.
he
asked
me,
in
my
open
argument
whether
or
not
i
should
subscribe
that
i
found
anything
or
--
the
way
he
put
it
was
that
are
must
necessarily
i
believe
attack
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
that's
right.
i
believe
you
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
this
proposition.
i
wish
that
was
in
the
majority.
if
we
are
--
as
i
see
this
case
here,
if
it's
in
three
years
--
it's
got
to
be
in
three
years
discrimination
before
it
could
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
if
nearly
the
cause
of
proportion
on
its
population
then
we
must
look
to
the
united
states
senate.
if
we
look
to
united
states
senate,
you
can
see
where
in
19
--
according
to
1960
census,
date,
years
of
following
figures
31
million
people
in
the
26
most
populous
state
representing
17%
of
the
population
of
the
united
states
had
52%of
the
representation
in
the
united
states
senate.
now,
as
fourteenth
amendment
going
to
look
forward,
more
protection
to
the
voters
then
it
would
in
--
and
to
its
state
voters
then
it
would
to
federal
voters.
now,
that's
the
proposition
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
faces.
the
other
proposition
is
--
in
history
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
stating
this,
then
on
our
system
of
electoral
college.
i
believe
that
there
has
been
a
person
elected
that
didn't
receive
the
popular
vote,
majority
of
popular
vote
but
received
the
majority
of
an
electoral
college.
now
if
our
system
in
alabama
is
so
discriminator
that
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
then
why
don't
those
two
provisions
there
provide
us
some
protection
under
the
constitution.
why
don't
we
get
some
protection
from
these
other
states,
in
the
federal
election,
in
the
senate?
now,
we
contend
that
the
alabama
constitution
was
a
rational
claim
by
putting
certain
checks
in
there
but
not
having
over
105,
it
kept
the
house
to
the
lowest.
thirty-five
senators
and
then
you
had
to
form
your
senatorial
districts.
we
contend
that
that,
it
will
not
any
and
discrimination
there
in
the
constitution
itself,
but
it
was
because
the
legislature
had
failed
to
act
over
a
period
of
60
years.
and
when
they
did
submit
the
67-senator
amendment,
able
to
try
to
submit
it
to
the
people
before
the
people
ever
had
a
chance
to
vote
on
it,
it
was
dropped
down
by
our
federal
court.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
the
way
of
the
crawford
bill?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
well,
it's
not
in
effect
because
the
federal
district
court
has
knocked
it
out.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
no
sir.
it
became
in
effect
in
1966.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
if
the
court
had
enacted
it,
the
way
of
crawford
to
be
able
--
it
would
be
gone
into
low
in
1960.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
would
be
the
old
system,
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
but
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
you
mean
if
--
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
would
say
that
the
67
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
will
say
that
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
within
the
67-senator
amendment
bill
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
sir?
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes,
sir
but
it
would've
been
resubmitted
to
the
people
by
--
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
as
of
now,
yes.
but
the
way
of
the
crawford
to
be
able
to
be
--
it
would
back
on
the
book.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
i
understand
--
that's
right.
and
the
senate
--
and
the
1967
started
the
membership
could
be
submitted
to
the
people
as
a
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
no,
sir.
it
was
the
current
legislature
was
elected
under
this
court.
mr.
w.
mclean
pitts
yes
in
the
court's
approval.
the
two
bills
would
put
together.
the
67-senator
bill
and
the
way
of
crawford
bill
take
into
provisions
of
the
house
from
the
67-senator
and
the
provisions
of
the
senate
from
the
way
of
crawford,
the
two
put
together
that
is
what
the
federal
court
decree.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
people
of
alabama
should
have
a
right
to
vote
on
their
own
constitutional
amendment
in
which
their
legislature
has
fast,
they
should
be
given
the
right
and
have
the
opportunity
of
voting
to
see
whether
or
not
they
would
reapportion
the
legislature
of
alabama.
now,
even
though
that
may
not
meet
the
requirements
of
what
the
people
--
the
attorneys
of
the
appellee
desired
still
there
would
be
a
reapportionment
and
i
do
not
believe
on
the
baker
versus
carr
that
it
would
be
any
invidious
discrimination
there,
that
there
is
a
rational
claim.
and
for
that
reason,
we
say
that
then
we'd
have
a
reapportioned
legislature
that
would
meet
the
requirement
of
the
test
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court.
as
to
what
this
court
could
do
is
to
be
reversed,
that
might
have
put
several
things.
it
could
be
reversed
and
a
--
could
--
the
legislature
could
be
forced
to
submit
or
--
or
to
require
all
of
the
numbers
to
run
on
a
state
of
large
base.
i
don't
think
the
legislature
of
alabama
is
addressed
by
the
attorney
general's
statement
and
the
other
attorneys
with
the
appellate
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
would
ever
allow
that
to
happen.
i
think
that
they
would
pass
some
type
of
reapportionment
bill
that
would
reapportion
the
state
of
alabama.
but
to
place
what
these
gentlemen
wants,
attorneys
for
the
appellate
on
the
basis
that
they
want
re-approval
is
strictly
have
in
both
houses
on
this
population
basis
then
we
are
going
to
have
a
big
majority
of
the
state
of
alabama
that
is
not
going
to
have
any
representation
but
is
going
to
be
under
the
thumb
of
the
dense
areas
where
the
population
has
grew
because
of
industrial
area.
and
we
submit
that
it's
just
as
bad
to
have
a
people
living
under
those
conditions
as
is
to
be
having
a
minority
of
ruling
a
majority.
we
believe
that
the
constitution
of
alabama
has
set
a
system
of
checks
and
balance
and
it
stated
how
it
should
be
in
it
and
if
the
constitution
in
providing
for
representation
in
the
house
of
legislature
is
reasonable,
rational
and
can
be
bought.
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
