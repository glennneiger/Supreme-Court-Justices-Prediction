mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
entered
in
the
arguments
during
the
last
day,
today
and
yesterday,
i
think
the
political
picket
and
we've
done
this
generally
by
adhering
to
standards
of
apportionment
for
questionings
about
standards
of
apportionment
and
comments
on
them,
which
vary
from
the
shipping
interest
and
their
representation
in
the
legislatures,
the
interest
of
labor
and
business,
to
mathematics
and
formula
and
really
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
argument
that
if
one
fact
becomes
true,
it
is
that
the
easiest
judicially
and
most
--
most
easily
judicially
maintainable
standard
of
apportionment
can
certainly
be
population.
regardless
of
all
the
problems
that
may
develop
and
all
the
problems
that
may
exist
in
many
states,
and
may
exist
in
many
different
counties
and
different
districts,
it
would
seem
that
surely,
the
one
standard
that
is
measurable
in
each
instance
leaving
the
less
room
for
doubt
and
the
less
room
for
question
insofar
as
each
of
the
state
legislatures
of
this
nation
are
concerned,
is
the
ascertainable
standard
of
how
many
people
are
there
in
a
legislative
district
or
how
many
people
are
there
in
a
representative
seat.
now
in
alabama,
the
facts
have
been
adequately
noted
with
respect
to
the
existing
apportionment
of
the
legislature.
they
have
had
no
reapportion
since
1901
and
the
people
of
alabama
have
no
place
to
go
in
order
to
seek
redress
for
their
grievances
other
than
the
united
states
courts.
the
state
courts
of
alabama
have
refused
to
take
jurisdiction;
there
is
no
initiative
and
referendum
in
the
state;
the
legislature
for
60
years
refused
to
reapportion
and
there
is
of
course
no
conception
that
they
would
change
their
minds
except
under
a
court
order.
and
the
constitutional
convention
provisions
that
are
provided
in
our
constitution
allow
the
state
legislature,
and
provide
for
the
state
legislature
to
establish
the
method
of
representation
of
conventions.
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
over
--
especially
there
might
have
been
long
lapse
in
apportionment
that
where
we
have
or
to
have
another
constitutional
convention,
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
would
alter
in
its
default
with
respect
to
apportionment
by
selecting
delegates
for
that
convention
who
would
apportion
them
out
of
their
seats.
the
state
--
the
united
states
district
court
action
in
the
montgomery
in
enjoining
the
67-senator
amendment
was
to
us
quite
proper
and
quite
reasonable.
the
state
constitution
says
that
population
is
the
ascertainable
standard
and
that
it
cannot
be
changed
and
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
advisory
opinions
which
are
not
binding
upon
the
court
and
do
not
have
the
force
of
law
which
binds
only
those
justices
and
state
their
preferences,
as
who
do
state
their
preferences.
the
court
has
held
that
provision
cannot
be
taken
from
the
constitution
from
section
284.
now,
that
provision
quite
clearly
says,
that
in
alabama
at
least,
population
is
the
goal
for
which
we're
working
in
legislative
apportionment
and
representation
shall
be
based
on
population
and
that
provision
should
not
be
deleted
from
the
constitution
even
by
constitutional
amendment.
the
--
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
but
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
it's
in
--
i'm
not
sure
it
is
in
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
147.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir
that's
right.
now,
the
people
of
course
in
the
constitutional
convention
could
change
it,
but
they
can't
have
a
constitutional
convention
unless
the
legislature
called
the
convention.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
hold
no
brief
for
the
proposition
that
--
those
are
mentioned
though.
now,
the
67-senator
amendment
also
of
course,
in
our
judgment
was
complete
nullity.
the
--
on
its
face,
it
purported
to
provide
each
county
a
little
federal
sort
of
plan
with
representation
in
the
state
senate.
in
the
house
of
the
106
members
of
our
house
of
representatives,
67
of
them
are
also
allocated
on
the
basis
of
political
units
or
on
the
basis
of
some
sort
of
little
federal
plan.
now,
we
look
at
the
--
the
county
argument
and
the
use
of
--
and
the
use
of
counties
and
in
the
allocation
of
some
weight
for
counties
for
representation
purposes
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
as
it
has
been
stated
by
others
that
there
is
no
comparison
with
the
federal
government,
no
proper
comparison.
there
was
no
federal
compromise
with
respect
to
counties,
there
is
no
and
has
never
been
any
so-called
sovereignty
in
the
counties
that
are
created
by
the
states.
the
counties
are
have
only
such
right
that
are
granted
by
the
state
legislature
and
by
the
state
constitution
and
the
effect
of
the
utilization
of
these
political
units,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
rather
disastrous
as
far
as
the
government
of
our
state
legislature
is
concerned.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
over
a
period
of
history,
as
america
has
developed,
the
united
states
senate
has
been
an
effective
instrumentality
of
government,
but
is
extremely
doubtful
to
me
that
if
the
united
states
senate
were
totally
fragmented
with
fractional
interest.
if
the
senators
did
not
run
statewide,
if
they
did
not
--
in
a
state
like
alabama
for
instance,
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
industrial
interest
of
birmingham
and
shipping
interest
of
mobile,
the
farm
interest,
the
plantation
and
perhaps
the
black
belt,
the
tennessee
valley
authority
area
and
the
alabama
power
company
area,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
representation
that
we
might
get
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
might
well
be
a
mere
blocking
rather
than
a
useful
sort
of
representation.
but
in
most
states
in
the
union,
there
is
divergence
inside
of
the
senatorial
districts,
a
divergence
of
interest
that
molds
itself
and
measures
into
the
senator
who
comes
--
who
comes
forward.
now
inside
of
the
state,
the
principal
usage
for
representative
districts
is
to
break
down
into
smaller
and
smaller
units
the
area
of
representation
and
the
place
and
the
people
have
representation
so
that
one
representative
may
at
least
know
the
will
of
the
people
whom
he
represents.
now
to
me,
if
you
go
into
any
sense
of
area
representation
or
any
sense
of
political
unit
representation,
you
quite
naturally
have
in
it
a
rural
bias
because
it
just
seems
implicit
to
me
that
there
is
more
farmland
than
there
are
city
lands
and
in
this
nation,
there
are
fewer
farmers
than
are
the
city
people
and
if
you
use
land,
or
if
you
use
political
units
without
population
being
the
guiding
factor,
then
we
must
of
necessity
with
representative
â€“
reach
a
representative
standard
which
would
be
non-responsive
to
the
people.
and
the
function
of
the
government,
of
course,
should
be
the
--
its
response
to
the
people
whom
it
governs.
the
difference
--
it
seems
to
me
boils
down
to
the
question
of
trust
in
people.
if
there's
--
if
in
this
country
as
i
think
the
country's
(inaudible)
says
"if
we
assumed
that
power
of
self-government
is
the
power
of
people
to
think
and
to
reason
and
to
vote
and
to
properly
represent
them,
to
get
their
own
representatives,
then
the
courts
it
would
seem
would
be
standard
to
protect
the
minority
from
the
majority"
but
the
majority
surely
should
have
the
right
to
elect
representatives
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature.
for
if
that
right
doesn't
exist
in
both
houses
then
they
only
have
equal
protection
of
one-half
of
the
law.
now
in
the
alabama
case,
the
--
of
course
baker
v.
carr
was
decided
on
march
26,
on
a
march
30th
the
district
court
issued
an
order
setting
a
hearing
in
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
we
filed.
the
case
moves
rapidly.
on
april
14th
there
was
a
hearing
and
on
july
16th,
therefore
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
there
was
reapportionment.
i
am
quite
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
--
that
in
the
middle
district
of
alabama,
the
court
viewed
the
would-be
reapportionment
case
there
and
found
an
effective
remedy
and
under
court
order
had
an
election
held.
fashioned
a
remedy,
perhaps
better
than
we
could
dream
could
be
fashioned
from
far
away.
i
am
quite
certain
from
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
that
in
its
mind
at
the
moment
before
your
decisions
on
future
cases,
that
in
its
mind
at
the
moment,
population
is
the
standard
which
must
be
met
as
far
as
an
the
apportionment
is
concerned.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
it's
possible
in
a
sense.
it's
possible
in
the
senate
if
you
interpret
the
provision
which
says
that
no
county
shall
be
divided
into
two
districts.
if
you
--
if
you
interpret
that
as
a
pure
gerrymander
--
any
gerrymander
provision,
and
i
should
think
that
there
is
some
presumption
in
favor
for
constitutionality
of
course
of
the
state
constitution,
if
you
read
it
that
way
and
say
it
doesn't
mean
that
a
county,
the
county
may
not
be
divided
into
districts,
it
means
it
can
be
divided
between
districts
and
split
down
the
center
or
chopped
up.
now,
under
that
assumption,
your
senate
could
be
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
seven
senators
for
jefferson
county,
three
for
mobile
and
so
forth
which
would
be
on
the
basis
of
pure
population.
in
the
house
of
representatives,
there
is
no
way
under
this
constitution
to
have
an
absolute
population
apportionment
that
the
--
because
of
the
one
per
county
provision
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
i
think
so
and
equalities
in
the
house.
well,
in
some
instances
they
are
--
they
approached
what
i
would
consider
gross
to
support
but
i
think
as
far
as
a
temporary
measure
or
a
measure
with
respect
to
the
usage
of
the
state
for
the
next
few
years
it
could
be
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
say
now
and
of
course
i
assume
it
has
gone
through
varying
stages
you'll
understand
as
we
progress
why
did
we
changed
our
mind
with
respect
to
what
we
think
the
law
is.
i
would
say
that
quite
probably
not.
the
provision
requiring
one
per
county
in
the
house
of
representatives,
it
would
seem
to
me
would
deprive
again
people
of
their
vote
on
a
population
standard,
if
there's
to
any
deviation
from
population
in
either
house
of
the
representatives
if
that
were
the
court's
ruling,
then
it
could
go
under
the
state
constitution.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
should
think
so,
yes.
we
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
there
are
other
factors
to
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right.
the
--
i
might
add
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
i'm
--
i
--
i
don't
think
so
when
you
have
--
when
you
have
a
state
legislature
that
hasn't
abided
by
anything
else
in
the
same
provisions
or
anything
else
to
constitution.
because
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
say
as
far
as
common
parlance
is
concerned,
and
legislator
is
talking
and
that's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
no,
and
the
only
construction,
i
think
of
course
of
law
would
be
the
failure
of
the
legislature
to
utilize
the
provisions
into
--
and
to
bring
about
more
than
one
senator.
i
must
say
in
all
candor
that
in
history
of
alabama
there
has
not
been
any
senatorial
district
which
has
had
more
than
one
senator.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
practice
and
prior
to
this
suit,
i
would
say
that
there
was
commonly
accepted
that
jefferson
county
could
only
have
one
senator.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
and
we
are
joined
in
this
by
the
interveners
as
far
and
others
who
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i'm
satisfied
to
leave
this
matter
to
this
district
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir.
i
do
not.
gentlemen,
in
conclusion
i
would

mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
section
2.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
only
by
the
--
there's
been
no
adversary
proceeding
involved
it
all.
statements
by
the
judges
except
in
a
--
i
would
say
probably
in
the
case
of
waid
v.
pool
where
they
did
say
that
the
legislature
was
malapportioned
but
they
weren't
going
to
take
jurisdiction
that
was
--
there
was
not
specific
interpretation
of
this
provision
at
all.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
not.
they're
purely
advisory
opinions.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
each
of
the
justices
could
change
their
mind
on
the
next
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
on
the
next
group.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
they
are
not
binding.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
in
conclusion
with,
i
simply
state
that
we
do
think
the
district
court
is
competent
to
handle
the
matter
and
has
exhibited
a
great
deal
of
speed
in
doing
so
and
we
feel
that
the
rights
of
all
alabamans
and
all
americans
rest
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
with
respect
to
whether
on
people
do
have
on
the
basis
this
country
was
founded
for
each
man
one
vote.
