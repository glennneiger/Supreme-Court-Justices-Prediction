mr.
david
j.
vann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
intervenors
in
the
case
below
and
in
the
court
below,
we
join
with
the
plaintiffs
and
i
believe
all
of
the
intervenors
in
proposing
to
the
court
below
that
this
case
had
reached
a
stage
where
the
remedy
of
provisional
reapportionment,
as
we
proposed
it,
was
the
only
effective
way
to
which
the
court
could
deal
with
the
matter.
they
had
previously,
there
were
three
remedies
considered
by
the
court
below.
one
was
election
--
requiring
an
election
at
large
after
the
legislature
had
failed
to
act.
there
was
a
remedy
proposed
of
proportional
voting
of
existing
legislators,
and
there
was
the
remedy
of
provisional
reapportionment,
all
of
which,
we
felt,
were
within
the
discretion
of
equity.
however,
in
practical
impact,
it
was
our
contention
that
for
the
court
to
set
up
a
temporary
plan
which
the
legislature
itself
could
change
either
before
a
legislature
was
elected
under
that
plan
or
after
a
legislature
was
elected
in
that
plan,
gave
to
the
state
and
to
legislature
the
full
range
of
discretion
and
at
the
same
time
gave
the
litigants
a
full
opportunity
and
full
protection
for
their
constitutional
standards.
however,
as
you
have
noted
from
our
appeal,
we
are
here,
in
this
court,
unlike
mr.
morgan,
to
say
that
we
feel
that
action
by
this
court
at
this
time
is
necessary
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
subject
that
i
want
to
discuss
with
you.
we
come
from
a
state
that
has
10%
of
the
natural
resources
of
america,
mainland
america.
this
state
has
been
locked
in
an
impasse
for
the
expression
of
the
popular
will
of
the
people
for
over
60
years.
in
this
case,
while
this
case
was
pending,
we
attempted
to
utilize
every
single
way
that
was
opened
to
us.
we
backed
the
jefferson
county
democratic
campaign
committee
and
others.
we
backed
to
proposals
in
the
legislature,
and
we
petitioned
the
legislature.
when
the
legislature
passed
the
crawford-webb
bill,
we
even
ask
that
the
government
to
veto
and
then
use
his
power
of
amendment.
mr.
david
j.
vann
as
i
was
saying
before,
the
lunch
hour,
our
purpose
in
being
in
this
appeal
is
because
we
feel
that
additional
relief
in
this
case
is
necessary
now.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well
we
have,
one
of
the
alabama
constitution,
a
procedure
of
executive
amendment.
the
executive
can
veto
a
bill
and
propose
an
amendment
to
the
bill
which
if
accepted
by
the
legislature
would
avoid
his
veto.
and
we
asked
the
governor
to
amend
the
crawford-webb
bill
to
provide
for
proper
reapportionment
and
submit
it
back
to
the
legislature
with
an
executive
amendment,
the
governor
refused
to
do
so.
mr.
david
j.
vann
yes,
but
the
governor's
veto
in
alabama
can
be
overwritten
by
a
simple
majority,
so
it's
not
as
effective
a
veto
as
you
have
in
some
other
states
and
in
federal
veto.
mr.
david
j.
vann
a
talking
veto.
and
the
--
when
you
have
a
position,
as
we
were
in
justice
stewart,
where
in
the
state
senate,
with
20%
of
the
people,
we
only
had
--
we
had
less
than
3%
of
the
representation.
we
couldn't
--
we
--
although
we
were
in
near
majority
status
with
others
counties
affected,
we
couldn't
even
effectively
use
those
legislative
devices
used
to
protect
minorities.
we
don't
have
enough
power
to
even
use
minority
protection
in
the
state
senate
(inaudible),
for
example
the
filibuster.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
right,
i
say
the
--
let's
say
the
majority
doesn't
even
--
can't
--
doesn't
--
it
can't
even
effectively
utilize
normal
minority
protection.
mr.
david
j.
vann
in
our
judgment,
no.
and
that
is
one
of
the
--
i
pointed.
that
i
would
like
to
cover
in
a
very
short
time
that
i
have.
one,
i
like
to
say
why,
why
we
feel
additional
relief
is
needed
and
we
have
asked
in
effect
for
alternatively
for
a
direction
to
the
district
court
to
--
to
provide
at
least
substantially
population
reinforcement
in
the
state
senate
or
we've
asked
for
a
declaration
from
the
court,
the
declaration
--
well
either
remediate,
we
think
might
result
in
a
legislative
result
before
the
district
court
could
handle
it,
it
would
give
the
district
court
another
opportunity
if
the
legislature,
again,
failed
to
act.
now,
we
have
this
situation,
the
senate
has
provided
for
in
the
--
in
the
order
below.
it
does
not
even
eliminate
the
most
egregious
discrimination
in
the
--
in
the
senate.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
fact
that
our
county
with
20%
of
the
people
has
only
one
senator
means
that
we
have
one-seventh
of
the
voice,
that
our
population
would
entitle
us
to
in
the
state
senate.
the
senate
district
of
bibb
and
perry
has
20
times
the
voice
of
my
county,
mobile
county
which
mr.
mcconnell
comes
here,
only
has
a
third
of
the
voice
to
this
population
would
entitle
to
it,
and
bibb
and
perry
county
have
ten
times
the
voice
of
mobile.
now,
this
produces
a
very
serious
problem
and
it
has
very
mediate
and
very
practical
results.
a
member
of
a
legislature
is
more
than
a
person
to
vote.
a
member
of
the
state
senate
along
his
own
committees,
he's
chairman
of
committees.
he
has
powers
beyond
his
vote
in
the
channeling
of
legislation.
the
existence
of
representation
affects
your
areas'
relationship
with
the
state
executive.
in
our
county,
may
it
please
the
court,
has
been
generally
regarded
by
the
state
as
the
pool
from
which
the
taxes
should
come
and
the
place
that
which
very
little
of
the
money
should
return.
this
--
we've
had
state
aid
to
small
counties
without
the
consent
of
the
payer
for
that
aid.
now,
coming
to
the
point,
and
i
think
the
crucial
point
is
that,
pointed
out
by
attorney
general
richmond
flowers.
the
crucial
point
that
i
think
has
cost
the
legislature
to
be
at
loggerheads,
it
was
a
crucial
point
that
i
think
disturbed
the
district
court
below
was
the
provision
of
section
200
of
the
state
--
of
the
state
constitution
which
says,
“no
county
shall
be
divided
between
two
districts,
and
no
district
shall
be
made
up
of
more
than
two
counties
not
contiguous
to
each
other.”
now,
the
first
line
there,
“no
county
shall
be
divided
between
two
districts,”
is
the
point
that
has
troubled
people.
now,
the
appellants
get
around
there
by
simply
changing
the
language
when
they
quote
the
constitution.
in
their
brief,
at
page
15
and
18,
they
simply
changed
the
word
between
to
into
and
this
--
this
was
the
way
they
argued
it
this
morning.
the
assuming
of
what
that
word
between
means
by
changing
it
to
into.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
merely
tasked
this
vital
point
of,
by
assuming
in
his
statement
of
facts
that
this
means
“into”
instead
of
between.
solicitor
general,
in
his
brief
sights
and
treats
this
in
its
footnote
on
page
6
by
saying
that
this
has
been
interpreted
by
apportionment
under
the
1901
constitution.
well,
in
the
first
place,
until
the
crawford-webb
bill
was
passed,
there
had
never
been
an
apportionment
statute.
you
are
cited
to
code
provisions
in
the
1940
code
which
appear
to
be
a
legislative
apportionment
of
some
kind.
well
now,
the
legislature
of
alabama
reapportioned
itself
almost
faithfully,
every
ten
years,
from
1920
through
1892.
and
the
code,
in
existence
in
1901,
had
a
code
section
in
it
which
set
out
the
latest
apportionment
under
the
1892
bill.
when
the
code
was
revised
in
1903
and
again
in
1923,
the
code
committee
simply
wrote
the
constitutional
provisions
in
instead
of
adding
inaccurate
code
section
which
of
course
no
longer
apply.
the
only
semblance
of
--
of
anything
is
the
incorporation
into
the
code
of
the
constitution
itself
by
a
code
committee.
there's
never
been
a
legislative
act
to
intervene
it.
the
question
has
never
been
ruled
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
that
was
another
thing
we
did.
we
asked
the
governor
and
we
had
to
right
to
ask
for
advisory
opinions.
we
asked
him
to
submit
this
question
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
he
refused
to
do.
because
this
has
been
the
point,
when
you
have
a
group
of
people
who
held
legislative
power,
they
hold
it
in
a
minority
basis.
they're
being
asked
to
vote
themselves
out
of
power
or
to
reduce
their
power.
they
don't
want
to
give
away
anymore
power
than
they
have
to.
and
i
think
the
legislature
of
alabama,
i
know
many
members,
is
basically
a
fair-minded
body.
i
think
if
they
knew
what
the
standard
was,
we'd
have
an
excellent
chance
of
getting
a
proper
bill
from
the
legislature.
but
as
long
as
this
point
is
in
doubt
and
we
attempt
to
be
to
get
it
ruled-on
on
the
court
below.
as
long
as
this
point
is
in
doubt,
i
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
get
relief
from
the
legislature.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
it
is
a
vital
importance.
now,
let's
--
mr.
david
j.
vann
alright,
that's
what
i
want
to
tell
you
sir.
the
constitution
in
five
or
six
places
including
this
provision
in
284
which
says,
“population
shall
not
be
removed
by
constitutional
amendment”
which
is
a
strong
--
a
statement
as
the
constitutional
convention
could
have
made,
repeatedly,
states
that
population
is
the
standard,
is
their
goal
and
is
their
guideline.
now,
interpreting
the
instrument
within
its
four
corners
as
--
in
accordance
with
alabama
practice
and
the
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
you,
this
provision
would
be
entitled
--
i
mean,
would
be
interpreted
as
being
in
line
with
that
statement
and
that
would
make
it
a
provision
which
is
a
provision
against
gerrymandering
which
is
very
reasonable
that
if
you've
got
a
group
of
a
republican
voters
or
--
or
group
of
pink
people
or
blue
people
or
green
people,
you
can't
divide
them
up
and
tack
them
on
to
the
additional
counties
by
dividing
a
county
into
fragments.
now,
this
provision
originally
came
into
the
constitution
of
alabama
in
substance
in
the
original
constitution.
and
there
was
never
any
discussion
of
it
and
on
the
floor
of
any
subsequent
constitutional
convention.
the
language
got
changed
several
times
in
redrafting
but
it's
been
there
from
the
first.
now,
as
it
was
originally
worded
in
the
constitution
of
1819
it
said,
“when
a
senatorial
district
shall
be
composed
of
two
or
more
counties,
no
county
shall
be
divided
in
forming
a
district.”
which
is
exactly
the
interpretation
which
we
say
the
court
should
be
--
should
place
upon
it
today.
now,
this
is
an
interpretation
within
the
framework
entirely
of
alabama
law.
now,
we
feel
that
in
dealing
with
an
historic
document
of
people
such
as
the
constitution
of
alabama
and
it
is
one
of
those
more
ancient
in
its
origins
of
those
--
of
the
50
states
that
the
court
should
deal
with
them
most
candidly.
but
we
believe
this,
we
believe
that
population
is
the
standard
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
believe
the
court
should
place
an
interpretation
upon
our
state
constitution,
so
as
to
make
that
constitution
or
have
--
as
to
prevent
the
constitution
from
reaching
a
constitutional
issue
that
would
strike
its
provision
down
unnecessarily.
or
reading
it,
this
rule
of
construction
is
applied
that
you
would
--
the
court
would
still
adapt
our
interpretation.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well,
i
believe
it
was
first
changed
in
the
period
during
the
civil
war.
we
had
quite
a
series
of
constitutional
conventions.
we
had
one
right
at
the
first
to
civil
war
where
they
wrote
succession
into
the
constitution.
then
we
had
one
under
the
military
government
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war
where
they
wrote
of
abolition
of
slavery
into
the
state
constitution.
and
this
was
submitted,
that
voted
the
people
and
it
didn't
pass
but
military
governor
certified
it
did
and
they
had
a
bunch
of
confusion
about
that,
so
they
came
back
the
next
year,
i
think
and
had
another
constitution.
and
during
this
time,
this
thing
does
not
change.
then
following
the
last
carpetbagger
constitution,
if
you
pardon
me,
is
what
we
call
it
in
alabama.
the
court
after
the
tilden
election
had
another
convention
and
i
might
say
that
no
one
who
attended
any
of
the
previous
conventions
was
at
the
constitution
of
1875.
and
wrote
another
constitution
and
it
was
at
that
time,
with
no
discussion
that
this
change
was
made
and
it
was
incorporated
without
a
comment
in
the
constitution
of
1801.
now,
--
i
mean
1901,
i
have
to
say
this,
that
no
county
has
ever
had
two
senators.
but
at
no
time
since
1901,
has
the
failure
to
give
a
county
two
senators,
produced
serious
ratios.
there
were
times
when
someone
might
be
entitled
to
two,
but
1901
was
the
time
of
the
industrialization
of
jefferson
county.
our
city,
birmingham
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war.
we
had
this
massive
vote
in
the
1890s
--
and
then
really
massive
after
1901.
so
the
problem
did
not
attain
its
serious
proportions
until
after
1901.
mr.
david
j.
vann
it
never
had.
this
question
has
never
been
submitted.
mr.
david
j.
vann
we
asked
--
that
we
asked
the
governor
to
submit
it.
mr.
david
j.
vann
in
fact,
i
think
we
asked
the
legislature
to
submit
it
and
they
all
refused
to
submit
it
and
i
think
they
were
afraid
of
what
might
be
said
and
they
thought
they
would
just
go
home
with
just
one
senator.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well,
you
might
say
it
leaned
--
mr.
david
j.
vann
you
might
say
it
leaned
heavily
and
i've
read
it
that
way.
and
i've
also
read
it
to
say,
just
the
opposite.
that's
a
right
confusing
paragraph
of
--
it
seems
to
me,
in
one
way
the
court
says
that
we
ought
to
do
that
but
if
we
did
it,
we
would
give
the
people
with
the
majority
of
the
--
of
the
citizens,
a
majority
of
the
votes
in
the
city
is
in
fact
--
and
say
that's
some
horrible
result
of
--
and
with
that
statement,
it
sort
of
disturbs
me.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
right,
they
say
if
(voice
overlap),
if
we
do
this
we
would
have
to
rule
this
but
we're
not
satisfied
we
should
do
so.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well
now,
this
is
the
point
that
the
solicitor
general
makes,
so
this
is
a
temporary
order.
this
is
not
a
temporary
order
in
my
estimation.
and
in
fact
--
in
fact,
i
believe
that
if
this
was
a
temporary
order
or
at
least
one
of
the
appeals,
would
not
be
properly
in
this
court,
i
think
you
have
to
treat
this
as
a
final
order
below.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well,
as
i
said
it
is
a
provisional
order.
mr.
david
j.
vann
well,
provisional
order
is
one
which
remains
in
effect
until
a
changed.
now,
in
basic
of
the
court
is
seeking
change,
your
honor,
by
the
legislature.
of
course,
in
the
legislature,
of
course,
it
has
many
more
to,
who's
available
to
deal
with
reinforcement.
they
can
change
the
sizes,
if
--
if
they're
not
seriously
affecting
the
representation
of
some
other
county,
they
can
deal
with
these
problems
of
economy
and
so
forth
and
--
and
maybe
shift
counties
around
without
--
where
there's
no
discrimination
resulting,
i
would
conceive
that.the
courts
can't
do
that.
court
merely
wants
to
put
a
perfect
plan
of
how
they
would
do
this
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
moss
against
burkhart,
which
will
be
before
the
court,
i
understand
later
in
the
year.
and
i
feel
that
the
court
below
should
have
done
what
monroe
said
in
that
case
that
if
a
court
is
going
to
enter
a
provisional
order,
it
should
intertwine
that
protects
our
constitutional
right,
as
you
said
in
the
watson
case
your
honor,
constitutional
rights
are
for
the
here
and
now.
and
there's
must
be
some
overwhelming
reason
for
not
doing
so.
well,
at
the
time
this
--
this
order
was
in,
the
legislature
had
recognized
i
think
that
it
could
not,
that
its
order
--
that
its
bills
were
not
good
because
they
--
they
not
only
passed
the
constitutional
amendment,
they
not
only
passed
the
crawford-webb
bill,
they
passed
the
special
primary
act.
and
they
said,
if
the
legislatures
reapportion
by
the
--
by
a
court,
they
started
the
whole
special
--
election
system,
anticipating
an
order
from
the
court.
the
whole
reinforcement
of
the
legislatures
that
now
sits
went
through
without
one
single
cage,
without
--
none
of
the
boogerman
that
have
been
raised
opposing
a
court
dealing
with
this
question
arose.
they
set
up
a
special
act,
we
elected
the
new
legislature,
it's
now
in
session.
but
the
senate
provisions
are
the
provisions
which
the
court
itself
held
were
unconstitutional.
they're
not
--
and
they're
not
just
a
little
unconstitutional.
they
did
not
remove
any
of
the
most
egregious
wherever
it
is
now.
on
its
face,
it
appears
to
do
more
than
it
does
because
the
special
primary
act
said
at
the
same
time
that
if
a
new
district
has
within
if
someone
who's
already
been
nominated
and
are
made
primary,
he
will
be
the
nominee
and
there'll
be
no
election.
and
the
legislature
had
framed
the
whole
crawford-web
bill
around
the
existing
members
of
the
senate.
so
while
on
its
subjects,
it
appears
to
makes
steps
at
removing
egregious
discrimination.
the
two
bills
in
para
materia
sitting
side-by-side
meant
that
there
was
no
change
in
the
senate
at
all.
mr.
david
j.
vann
correct.
mr.
david
j.
vann
correct.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
right.
but
here
--
mr.
david
j.
vann
now
i
--
i've
said
this
and
--
and
let
me
emphasize.
the
legislature
has
many
tools
to
deal
with
reinforcement.
they
set
up
a
plan
under
which,
we
are
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
representation
in
the
forming
of
a
permanent
plan.
in
other
words,
the
court
has
set
it
up,
leaving
in
control
the
same
people
who
don't
want
to
give
up
the
power
and
they're
going
to
--
they're
going
to
--
we
must
assume
if
--
under
the
natural
course
of
events,
they
are
going
to
device
a
permanent
plan,
if
they
do
which
limits
us
just
as
much
as
they
think
they
can
get
away
with
in
this
court.
now,
i
mean
we
have
to
make
this
assumption,
i
believe.
and
i
believe
that
we're
entitled
equal
protection
in
the
formation
of
that
plan
and
that's
the
reason
i
--
mr.
david
j.
vann
i'll
have
the
court
--
the
court
below
i
think
would
have
one
of
several
choices
and
i
think
the
discretion
of
that
court
should
be
recognized.
mr.
david
j.
vann
the
court
--
the
court
needs
to
order
no
election.
i
don't
believe
the
court
should
order
an
election
at
large
because
i
believe
this
is
a
chaotic
form
of
election
where
you're
electing
105
members
of
one
house,
135
of
others.
you'll
have
many
areas
of
state
with
no
representation
at
all
and
i
could
go
on.
and
these
are
the
reasons
i
object
to
do
election
at
large
and
feel
that
this
is
a
much
more
conservative
remedy
of,
they
--
but
they
could
treat
that.
they
could
use
--
they
could
modify
this.
we
have
a
special
election
procedure.
for
instance,
if
the
appellant
should
win
in
this
case
and
if
you
were
to
(inaudible)
by
reversal,
the
ten
new
legislators
from
my
county,
there
would
be
vacancies.
they'll
all
provide
the
government
shall
call
it
special
election
to
fill
the
vacancies
and
the
legislation.
if
the
court
below
gave
us
the
proper
representation,
the
laws
of
alabama
are
in
any
existence,
the
court
has
to
do
nothing
required
the
government
calls
special
election
to
fill
those
vacancies.
you
can,
without
disruption,
without
any
court
supervision
of
elections
or
anything
of
that
nature
make
the
correction.
or
this
--
the
other
remedy
which
was
rejected
below
that
you
could
use
proportional
voting
in
the
present
legislature
without
affecting
its
members
at
all
since
the
next
election
is
a
long
way
off,
you
could
give
the
one
senator
from
jefferson
county
seven
votes
in
this
matter
and
effect
equal
proportions
by
proportional
voting.
this
was
a
remedy
suggested
by
amicus
brief
below.
mr.
david
j.
vann
we
couldn't
do
that
and
this
is
the
reason
we
objected
proportional
voting
below,
and
we
that
we
felt
with
an
election
coming
on
that
this
was
impractical
since
he
couldn't
serve
him
any
more
committee
in
many
times.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
vann
(voice
overlap)
with
special
primary
act
and
just
(inaudible)
general
election.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
vann
all
members
served
for
four
years
--
mr.
david
j.
vann
so
they
have
three
more
years
to
serve.
this
is
a
long
time.
mr.
david
j.
vann
that's
right.
they've
already
passed
more
taxes
in
any
of
legislature
history
and
we
failed.
