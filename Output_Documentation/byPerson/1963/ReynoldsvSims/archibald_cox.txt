mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
come
to
my
argument
proper,
i
want
to
comment
very
briefly
on
two
points
with
respect
to
which
our
brief
maybe
misleading.
first
is
this
question
concerning
the
interpretation
of
the
provision
in
the
state
constitution,
"no
county
shall
be
divided
between
two
districts
and
no
district
should
be
made
up
with
two
or
more
counties
not
contiguous
to
each
other.‚Äù
it's
the
first
half
of
that
that
we're
concerned
with.
we
have
assumed
in
our
brief
that
this
meant
that
no
county
could
have
more
than
one
senator.
now,
i
did
not
--
we
made
the
assumption
partly
because
it
seemed
to
make
the
case
hardest
against
this.
we
made
the
assumption
also
because
we
understood
perhaps
wrongly
that
that
was
the
interpretation
people
in
alabama
put
on
it.
i
did
not
mean
to
be
arguing
that
that
was
the
right
interpretation.
indeed,
as
i
read
it
as
an
outsider,
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
an
extraordinary
interpretation
and
then
i
would
have
read
the
other
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
it
made
it
a
somewhat
harder
case
for
us,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
to
read
it
the
way
they
do
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
in
that
event
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
didn't
think
so
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
at
least
they're
reading
it
that
way,
alabama
could
say
that
in
the
crawford-webb
act
and
some
of
these
things,
it
was
conforming
to
its
own
constitution
and
it
also
could
cite
as
support
for
what
it's
doing
in
the
provisions
and
a
good
many
state
constitutions
that
do
say,
that
on
--
county
can
have
only
one
senator.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
those
things
cut
against
it.
the
only
point
i'm
really
trying
to
make
is
that
i
do
not
want
to
seem
to
be
expressing
a
considered
view
on
this
question,
it's
a
question
of
alabama
law,
and
i'm
one
of
the
last
equipped
by
background
or
experience
or
anything
else
that
have
a
view
on
it.
i'm
just
going
to
make
a
claim
that
we
don't
argue
either
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
that
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
after
listening
to
what
has
been
said
here
about
the
alabama
understanding
an
alabama
practice,
i'm
bound
to
say
that
that
raises
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
that
is
the
state's
own
interpretation.
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
bring
it
out
very
well.
the
other
point
on
which
i
think
i
was
guilty
of
some
misunderstanding
is
in
no
statements
in
which
i
said
that
it
was
questionable
whether
the
crawford-webb
act
had
become
effective.
upon
rethinking
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
would
become
effective
as
of
the
1966
election.
and
that
the
statement
said,
it
say
that
this
was
intended
to
take
effect
only
if
the
constitutional
amendment
were
voted
down
are
inconsistent
with
the
words
of
the
crawford-webb
act.
it
said
it
shall
effect
as
of
the
1966
election
was
known
ifs,
ands,
and
buts,
so
that
the
constitutional
amendment,
would
i
take
at
least
out
of
the
conditions
subsequent
rather
than
its
defeat
thing,
a
condition
proceeding.
i
don't
think
the
use
of
matter
either
of
them,
matters
to
go
to
the
essence
but
i
did
want
to
beguile
you
of
misleading
the
court.
alright,
now
i
do
come
to
the
points
that
we
wanted
to
develop.
our
position
as
stated
in
the
brief
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
there
are
number
of
issues
in
the
case,
three
apportionments
that
i
think
it
all
falls
most
easily
into
place,
if
we
take
up
the
questions
in
the
same
sequence
that
they
came
before
the
district
court,
what
they
are
facing.
and
i
shall
attempt
to
relate
each
of
those
issues
to
the
basic
thesis
that
i
sought
to
expand
yesterday.
but
the
first
question
in
the
district
court
was
rather
the
apportionment
in
effect
in
alabama
then,
the
1901
apportionment
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
it's
quite
blind
i
think
and
to
defeat
it
is
hardly
argued
that
that
apportionment
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
second
principle
that
i
sought
to
state
yesterday.
in
other
words,
that
it
discriminates
between
people,
they
stand
equally
--
unequally
before
the
election
law
without
any
rhyme
or
reason,
without
any
justification
before
the
inequality.
and
under
baker
and
carr,
the
court
has
power
to
adjudicate
that
would
we
should
think
without
any
question
hold
that
that
apportionment
is
unconstitutional.
we've
given
the
evidence,
so
it's
a
crazy
quilt
in
our
brief
i
see
no
need
to
take
the
time
to
give
the
court
a
message
that
was
here.
the
question
then
arose
but
remedy
should
the
district
court
direct.
the
legislature
had
already
considered
this
question
by
raised
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
before
it
made
a
firm
adjudication
had
indicated
its
views
and
an
opinion,
and
the
legislature
had
done
three
things.
first,
it
had
provided
no
rule
for
the
november,
1962
election
and
there
was
a
legislature
to
be
elected
then.
it
did
pass
a
law
indicating
that
if
the
court
should
direct
an
apportionment
and
then
the
state
election
would
be
conducted
in
accordance
with
that
apportionment,
which
in
effect
indicated
that
if
a
state
was
prepared
to
fit
with
what
the
court
might
do.
at
second,
the
legislature
put
up
to
the
people,
the
so-called
67-senator
amendment
to
be
voted
in
november,
1962.
and
third,
it
enacted
the
crawford-webb
act
that
i
referred
to
early.
that
would
seem
to
me
that
at
this
point,
the
district
court
was
required
to
consider
the
67-senator
amendment
not
as
an
effective
provision
because
it
hadn't
been
ratified
by
the
people
and
i
supposed
ordinarily,
a
court
wouldn't
passed
on
--
the
federal
court,
it
wouldn't
passed
on
the
constitutionality
of
something
that
hadn't
become
effective
law.
but
here,
the
court
was
under
an
obligation
to
shape
any
decree
it
might
entered
as
closely
to
the
desires
of
the
people
of
alabama
as
expressed
through
their
public
arguments
as
it
was
able
at
the
--
the
prime
rating
if
i
may
use
that
expression
that
the
legislature,
the
best
desirable
in
alabama,
subject
to
criticism
as
it
might
be
as
unrepresentative
had
indicated
that
the
apportionment
in
the
67-senator
amendment
was
the
one
that
it
thought
was
most
desirable.
and
if
that
did
not
infringe
on
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights,
then
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
an
error
of
law
for
the
district
court
not
to
incorporated
that
in
its
decree
or
at
least
to
permit
the
election
to
have
been
conducted
in
accordance
with
that
apportionment.
so
the
court
was
obliged
to
consider
whether
the
67-senator
amendment
would
infringe
on
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights.
it
was
obliged
to
consider
the
crawford-webb
act
for
the
same
reason.
now
of
course,
the
1962
election
has
been
held
that
the
crawford-webb
act
is
still
in
a
reality
with
respect
to
the
1966
election
and
therefore,
would
have
to
be
considered.
so
i
think
that
both
of
those
apportionments
are
before
the
court
for
properly
--
for
consideration
just
as
if
they
were
effective
law.
the
67-senator
amendment,
we
say
is
invalid
because
it
makes
classifications
or
differentiations
that
within
the
usual
equal
protection
standards
are
arbitrary
and
capricious,
point
out
that
something
maybe
arbitrary
or
capricious
for
at
least
three
reasons.
they
correspond
to
the
second,
third
and
fourth
to
the
proposition
as
i
outlined
yesterday.
something
maybe
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
there
was
no
intelligible
foundation
to
just
if
--
through
days
had
some
other
system
like
that.
that's
not
applicable
to
the
67-senator
amendment.
it
does
have
a
rule
both
with
the
respect
to
the
senate
and
with
respect
to
the
house
of
representatives.
the
rule
in
the
senate
you'll
recall
is
one
from
each
county.
the
rule
in
the
house
is
one
from
each
county
and
then
the
rest
according
to
population.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
does
not
violate
the
crazy
quilt
doctrine.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
good.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
meant
on
that
ground.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
i
think
in
addition
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
does
not
violate
the
doctrine
that
i
stressed
yesterday
in
the
new
york
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
that's
the
crazy
quilt
doctrine.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
just
to
(voice
overlap)
the
same
thing.
let
me
--
let
me
just
include
the
two
or
three
sentences
and
perhaps
i
then
can
make
what
i've
been
trying
to
say
clear.
i
take
it
that
something
maybe
arbitrary
precious
even
though
intelligible,
in
the
sense
that
the
line
that
it
draws,
the
differentiation,
has
no
relation
to
any
--
no
--
no
rational
relationship
to
any
permissible
legislative
purpose.
but
that
--
that
is
true
in
brown
against
board
of
education
or
it's
true
in
any
number
of
cases
that
there
is
an
intelligible
differentiation
of
pattern.
and
i
say
that
if
there
is
a
pattern
violates
--
does
not
violate
the
crazy
quilt
doctrine,
still
it
is
an
irrational
differentiation
if
the
criteria
bear
no
rational
relationship
to
a
permissible
legislative
purpose.
now,
we
said
that
the
new
york
apportionment
of
the
senate
bore
no
rational
relationship
when
you
examine
it
closely
to
any
permissible
legislative
purpose
because
the
purposes
that
would
claim
for
it
keeping
the
size
of
the
county
small,
giving
people
access
to
their
representatives
and
so
forth,
were
purposes
that
it
had
to
tendency
to
accomplish
when
you
examined
it.
the
county
--
the
districts
were
getting
bigger.
what
it
did
was
create
a
class
society
in
a
political
sense
that
it
happened
to
say
that
one
class
of
people
should
have
more
votes
than
another,
and
that
was
its
only
function.
and
that
we
say
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
it
is
not
related
to
any
permissible
legislative
purpose.
now,
the
67-senator
amendment
is
not
bad
on
this
ground
mr.
justice,
in
our
view.
it
is
--
it
has
a
rational
tendency
to
do
two
things.
it
does
--
or
three
things
that
i
suppose
taking
a
--
it
has
a
tendency
to
assure
that
each
county
will
have
at
least
one
representative
while
at
the
same
time,
the
legislature
does
not
get
so
big
as
to
be
unmanageable
and
i
presumed
that
those
are
not
only
intelligible
but
permissible
purposes
of
legislative
apportionment.
and
in
the
case
of
the
one
senator
for
each
county,
it
again
tends
to
do
the
same
thing.
so
the
question
arises
at
this
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
all
--
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
the
house,
it
really
combines
two
things,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
it's
population
and
one
free.
mr.
archibald
cox
than
the
overflowing
population.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
105.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
and
67
of
them
are
distributed
one
for
each
county
which
leaves
you
another
38
to
distribute
by
population.
it
results
as
i
point
out
in
a
moment
in
the
smallest
--
the
majority
might
be
elected
by,
i
think
it's
41%
--
by
counties
having
41%
of
the
population.
in
the
senate,
it's
much,
much
smaller.
the
senate
is
less
than
20%.
this
brings
us
to
a
further
of
sense
in
which
i
think
something
maybe
an
unreasonable
or
arbitrary
and
capricious
differentiation
and
that
is
when
the
objectives
to
put
it
generally
that
the
law
seeks
to
accomplish,
are
so
trivial,
so
inconsequential
in
relation
to
the
interest
that
are
being
sacrificed
that
anyone
would
say
that
that
is
an
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
of
balance
that
has
been
struck.
and
then
an
effort
to
incorporate
that
in
the
language
suitable
to
the
apportionment
problems,
we
suggested
as
our
fourth
proposition
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
by
an
apportionment
which
subordinates
the
principles
of
popular
representation
in
majority
of
rule
to
other
permissible
objectives
of
apportionment
to
such
a
degree
as
to
create
gross
in
equalities,
in
per
capita
representation
and
give
control
of
the
legislature
to
representatives
chosen
by
very
small
minorities
of
the
people.
in
applying
this
principle,
the
legislature
we
think
must
be
judged
as
a
whole.
one
must
have
a
rule
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
unicameral
legislature
and
they
had
clearly
judged
it
as
a
whole.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
in
attempting
to
give
more
meaning
to
that
general
statement,
it's
appropriate
to
take
into
account
that
it
will
generally
have
to
be
applied
to
bicameral
legislatures
in
this
county,
not
invariably
but
generally
and
it's
appropriate
to
see
how
it
would
apply
to
them,
so
that
we
suggest
to
subordinate
comments
to
the
generalization.
first,
we
assume
because
there's
no
need
to
call
it
otherwise
in
these
cases
that
when
one
house
of
the
legislature
is
apportioned
substantially
according
to
the
population
then
we
assumed
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
may
leave
considerable
room
in
the
other
house
partaking
these
other
permissible
purposes
into
account.
on
the
other
hand,
we
submit
that
it
--
would
require
the
very
strongest
kind
of
showing
of
other
purposes,
the
--
the
need
for
fulfilling
them
and
their
importance
to
justify
substantial
departures
from
per
capita
equality
and
the
sacrifice
of
majority
rule
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
majority
rule
will
not
operate
a
100%
unless
you
have
per
capita
equality
in
both
houses.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quite
clear.
but
i
was
not
suggesting
that
there
must
be
majority
rule
in
the
legislature.
i
was
saying
that
you
couldn't
subordinate
it
too
far
to
these
other
objectives.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
is
something
without
sound
suspicious.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
decided
to
each
case.
in
these
cases,
it
is
very,
very
far
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
and
it
is
in
both
houses.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
equal
protection,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
haven't
thought
of
case
before
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
all
voters,
all
the
populations
are
being
treated
alike.
it
would
be
a
peculiarly
negative
form
of
government
but
i
would
--
i
don't
see
immediately
and
in
respect
in
which
people
are
being
classified,
their
voters
are
being
classified.
or
equally,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
divert
too
far
but
i
do
hoped
to
deal
with
this
--
the
question
sometimes.
i
supposed
abolishing
the
legislature
doesn't
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
question
is
if
you
have
a
legislature
and
give
people
the
right
to
choose
it
just
as
if
you
have
a
court
system
and
give
people
access
to
the
court
then
that
is
equal
protection
applies.
now
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
--
i
suggest
the
answer
to
the
question
of
degree,
let
me
make
just
one
further
answer
to
this
like
all
questions
of
degree,
it's
hard
to
get
a
fix
rule
but
i
think
sometimes
we
can
clarify
our
thinking
by
articulating
the
generalization,
loses
it
maybe
in
different
ways.
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
what
we
have
--
the
proposition
i
have
formulated
might
be
put
in
somewhat
different
language
on
this
way.
looking
at
the
balance
that
the
state
has
struck
between
these
other
purposes,
like
not
too
large
districts,
a
recognition
of
the
county
or
town
as
an
entity.
here's
what
it
has
--
looking
at
it,
does
one
get
the
conviction
that
what
it
has
done
is
try
to
balance
between
the
notion
of
per
capita
equality
and
majority
rule
and
these
other
competing
considerations
that
require
some
modification
or
as
what
it
has
done
to
weight
some
areas
or
some
classes
people
who
live
in
some
areas
or
some
categories
of
people
as
more
important
in
the
political
world
than
others.
when
you
look
at
it,
which
conviction
are
you
left
with?
if
you're
left
with
the
conviction
that
this
involves
creating
preferred
political
classes
and
subordinate
political
classes
then
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
you're
left
with
a
conviction
that
the
legislature
focused
on
what
i
would
define
as
its
job
and
struck
this
balance
well,
we
might
not
agree,
still
it
would
seem
to
have
done
it
conscientiously
then
i
think
it
might
satisfy
my
test.
that's,
again,
not
more
precise.
let
me
come
to
--
let
me
come
to
this
particular
case
because
the
67-senator
amendment
is,
i
think,
most
egregious
in
this
respect
and
maryland
is
most
egregious
in
this
respect.
and
this
--
and
these
are
really
the
only
two
instances
that
i
don't
think
you
have
to
face
it
at
maryland
in
which
this
question
of
degree
does
have
to
be
faced
so
that
--
i
--
i
don't
have
to
fix
and
the
court
doesn't
have
to
fix
the
line
and
i
think
it
would
be
wise
not
to
fix
the
line
at
least
until
this
--
and
some
pretty
clear
view
as
to
where
it
would
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
new
york
i
don't
have
to
reach
this
proposition.
in
new
york
--
the
rule
in
new
york
apportionment
its
senate
on
is
--
has
no
relation
to
any
permissible
legislative
purpose.
but
let
me
put
--
let
me
put
it
--
let
me
put
an
illustration
there
like
this
mr.
justice
stewart
which
is
not
any
of
these
cases,
though
it's
close
to
the
virginia
case.
suppose
that
in
new
york,
the
people
of
erie
county,
which
is
one
in
buffalo,
one
of
the
big
counties,
were
given
only
one
representative
and
only
one
senator,
and
the
rest
of
the
state
was
apportioned
according
to
population.
i
take
it
to
the
state
would
look
pretty
good
in
terms
of
the
smallest
minority
that
could
control
the
legislature
in
either
house
in
terms
of
majority
rule
but
there
would
be
a
clear
and
an
irrational,
indeed
an
invidious
discrimination
against
that
county
as
a
matter
of
majority
rule
would
have
to
be
looked
at,
at
all.
so
in
the
new
york
case,
if
you
examine
it
closely,
that
we
suggest
this
in
our
brief,
we
didn't
do
it
as
a
good
job
as
within
i
have
but
if
you
examine
it
closely,
you'll
see
that
the
discrimination
between
the
county
is
over
6%
or
350th
as
the
deputy
and
attorney
general
insist
that
we
must
say
instead
of
6%,
does
not
tend
to
accomplish
any
of
the
purposes
that
keeping
county
small.
the
counties
have
been
getting
bigger.
the
people
who
have
been
benefiting
as
--
excuse
me,
the
district
has
been
getting
bigger.
the
county
is
having
the
senator,
the
senate
district.
the
people
who
have
been
benefiting
are
the
people
in
multidistrict,
multi-senatorial
district
counties
with
less
than
350th,
so
that
we
say
it
has
--
it
falls
under
my
second
rule.
it
has
no
rational
tendency
to
accomplish
any
permissible
purpose.
you
don't
have
to
consider
this
burden.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
oh,
well
i
really
--
excuse
me,
i
spoke
too
quickly.
i
--
i've
laid
that
question
to
one
side
and
i
say
it
would
be
a
much
harder
question
than
the
court
has
to
decide
now.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
the
majority
--
if
the
inequalities
in
the
senate
are
very,
very
great
and
the
majority
and
that
the
proportions
of
people
who
can
elect
a
majority
of
the
senate
is
very,
very
small
then
the
fact
that
the
other
house
is
apportioned
according
to
population,
i
would
say
should
not
be
enough
to
save
them.
i
am
under
no
necessity
of
arguing
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
to
--
to
illustrate
the
principle
and
not
to
just
lay
any
emphasis
on
the
figure.
i
should
think
one
might
well
say
that
if
you
have
population
in
the
lower
house
and
in
the
upper
house,
it
would
take
33%
of
the
people
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
senators
and
it
wasn't
too
gross
inequalities
between
the
county
that
that
would
do.
but
then
if
it
got
way
down
below
20%
as
it
does
in
alabama
that
that
wouldn't
do,
alright.
in
other
words,
i
think
it's
not
just
to
answer
both
in
terms
of
the
two
houses.
although,
i
point
out
here
that
if
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
because
neither
house
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
(inaudible)
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
freak
situation.
if
you
have
one
assembly
man
in
the
lower
house,
plus
a
remainder
distributed
according
to
population,
your
percentages
will
not
drop
very,
very
low
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
will
drops
down
to
around
0.5.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
then
i
think
you'd
come
out
would
very
nearly
substantial
per
capita
equality
in
both
houses.
but
i
think
my
answer
is
that
if
one
is
substantial
equality,
then
the
other
can
drop
fairly
low.
if
they
both
start
dropping
below
substantial
equality,
they've
got
to
meet
up
here.
i
don't
want
to
emphasize
again.
i
guess
i've
said
too
much
that
here
neither
house
is
anywhere
near
equality.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
think
those
are
absolutely
irrelevant,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
they
may
not
enter
into
this
scale
at
all.
they
might
be
these
things
i
tried
to
state
yesterday
as
permissible
purposes
but
urban
against
rural
or
management
against
labor
or
anything
that
it
involves,
what
i
think
can
fairly
we
called
class
distinctions
in
the
political
world
are
out.
that
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
what
equal
protection
means
that
you
can't
set
up
political
class.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
that
was
not
acceptable,
yes
because
your
honor,
put
the
point
very
well
yesterday.
when
you
talked
about
keeping
nine
cities
or
the
majority
from
having
control,
you
were
necessarily
saying
we're
going
to
turn
the
control
over
to
a
minority.
and
i
--
whether
the
majority
maybe
trusted
or
not,
i
say
no
greater
reason
to
trust
the
minority
and
the
hypothesis
of
our
constitution
is
that
one
is
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
other.
and
--
so
that
would
be
my
answer
to
that
--
to
that
line
of
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
would
say
--
no.
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i've
--
i
think
that
some
of
these
things
are
very
real.
my
political
experience
is
limited
to
having
bit
of
town
that
official
where
the
town
is
the
unit
of
(inaudible).
and
i
think
it
was
very
real
that
the
people
in
the
legislature,
the
general
court
look
to
the
people
who
are
the
town
officials
to
know
pretty
well
what
was
going
into
that
--
going
on
in
their
town,
what
its
people
thought,
what
its
needs
were.
and
i
think
this
is
something
of
which
can
be
--
i
assume
can
be
taken
into
effect.
i
think
it's
a
real
argument.
it's
a
different
kind
of
argument
at
least
other
than
arguments
that
are
made
about
the
rural
against
urban.
now,
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
--
of
course,
we
would
have
to
agree
with
you.
i
assumed
that
it
happens
in
a
great
many
instances
in
legislation.
we
both
know
when
the
labor
(inaudible)
that
one
reason
will
be
given
and
another
reason
is
in
people's
mind.
but
as
long
as
the
court
and
this
allows
play
in
the
joints,
i
think
it
is
a
good
thing.
as
long
as
the
good
reason
is
available
to
justify
it,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
can
go
behind
it
and
say
that
they've
taken
these
other
things
into
account.
that's
why
a
moment
ago
in
trying
to
rearticulate
my
test
in
way
i
--
i
spoke
not
of
the
practice
of
the
legislation
but
of
what
the
legislation
--
its
function
was,
what
looked
that
objectively
it
seemed
to
do.
did
it
create
preferred
classes
or
was
it
something
that
looking
at
it
that
honestly
be
judged
the
other
way?
may
i
say
just
one
sentence
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
archibald
cox
with
respect
to
the
decree
below,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
for
reasons
that
it
very
well
articulated
made
a
wise
exercise
of
its
discretion
here.
it
concluded
that
the
decree
would
enable
the
legislature
to
reapportion
itself.
it
retained
jurisdiction
to
act
if
it
had
to
and
bearing
in
mind
the
delicate
interplay
between
the
state
and
the
federal
court,
between
the
political
function
and
the
judicial
function,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
was
clearly
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
