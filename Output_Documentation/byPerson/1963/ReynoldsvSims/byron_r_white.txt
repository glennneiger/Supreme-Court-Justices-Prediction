justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
flowers
you've
--
you've
added
this
thought
over
what
you
have
in
you
brief
than
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
you
thought
there
was
nothing
to
decide
here
in
your
brief
but
now
you
suggest
that
the
--
we
really
should
get
to
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
in
the
alabama
constitution
themselves
are
acceptable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
even
if
the
--
even
if
the
--
i
gather
from
you
that
there's
some
of
the
mystery
about
what
the
alabama
constitution
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
do
believe
this
could
be
somewhat
of
a
problem,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
you
know
fairly
that
that's
what
alabama
constitution
means
to
say
that
the
apportionment
that
existed
before
the
court
took
action
violated
the
alabama
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
constitutional,
in
the
crawford
bill,
you
think
that
violates
the
existing
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
conclude
then
that
both
houses
have
to
be
on
a
state
population
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
said
a
moment
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
house,
one
way
or
another
is
only
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
(inaudible)
determines
to
affirm
these
solutions.
do
you
(inaudible)to
you
that
it
would
start
by
a
separate
(inaudible)
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
you
are
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
harder
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
harder
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
said
--
that
you
say
that
one
county
that
you
assumed
that
needed
one
county
per
senator
or
one
senator
per
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
you
read
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
the
other
house,
say
if
one
house
is
on
population
and
the
other
one
drops
below
as
you
put
it,
you
would
require
that
the
reasons
for
it's
dropping
below
be
something
other
i
supposed
than
simply
referring
urban
against
rural
or
rural
against
urban.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
state
comes
here
and
says
that,
“we
--
we
would
like
to
have
one
house
buried
in
the
population,
the
reason
is
to
keep
nine
cities
from
having
control”
and
you
would
say,
”that
is
unacceptable.”
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
--
is
the
crawford-webb
act
now
in
--
is
in
effect,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
--
there
was
nothing
--
there
was
nothing
left
to
do,
nothing
left
to
happen
to
it
in
some
of
the
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
has
enacted
it,
it
would
--
i
guess
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
and
the
only
apportion
of
system
that
is
in
effect
--
that
would
be
in
effect
is
the
court's
order
does
not
stand
is
the
old
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
either
the
constitutional
amendment
or
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
just
an
out
--
there
were
just
an
out
effect
outright
to
the
person
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
outside
the
court's
order,
the
only
apportionment
system
would
be
in
effect
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
in
effect.
it's
in
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
people
have
never
voted
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
as
of
now
--
as
of
now,
they
wouldn't
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand
but
not
in
the
1966.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
actually
the
legislature
that's
been
elected
wasn't
there
--
if
the
current
legislature
wasn't
elected
with
the
old
apportionment
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
interim
order,
into
the
interim
order.
