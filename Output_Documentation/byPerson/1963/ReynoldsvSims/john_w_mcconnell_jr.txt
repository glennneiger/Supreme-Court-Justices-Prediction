mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
we,
as
appellants,
who
are
also
intervene
as
plaintiffs
in
the
action
below.
we
have
brought
this
appeal
for
the
simple
and
sole
purpose
are
they
--
as
we
stated
in
our
brief
of
what
the
lower
court
did
not
say,
rather
than
what
it
did
say.
it
may
have
been
animated
and
perhaps
implicit
on
some
of
these
things
such
as
the
question
of
dividing
a
county
to
give
more
equality
of
representation
of
the
senate.
but
we
feel
that
the
court,
this
court,
should
set
out
guidelines
for
either
the
lower
court
or
the
legislature.
we
believe,
and
i
think
the
appearance
here
of
the
attorney
general
animates
that
whatever
the
court
gives
as
a
minimum
apportionment
will
be
the
maximum
apportionment
that
you
receive
in
the
legislature.
we
believe
that
it
needs
guidelines
and
standards.
now,
we've
been
here
for
two
days
talking
on
this
problem.
many
interesting
questions
have
a
risk
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
brief
time
that
it's
been
allotted
to
this
appellant
to
perhaps
answer
some
of
those
questions.
first,
we
are
here
as
individual
citizens.
i
do
not
claim
to
represent
an
urban
area,
a
certain
occupation
within
there.
i
am
first
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
alabama.
i
am
second
a
lawyer.
someone
else
may
be
first,
a
citizen
and
second
a
banker,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
protection
of
individual,
their
civil
private
rights.
we
think
there's
a
difference
between
apportionment
and
between
the
selection
of
the
unit
to
be
represented.
we
believe
and
i
believe
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
has
said
that
one
of
the
strength
and
advantages
of
our
system
was
that
we
had
50
laboratories
in
which
various
political
theories
could
be
tracked
and
we
think
that
should
be
strengthen
and
at
no
restriction
should
be
placed
on
the
individual
state
working
out
their
own
form
of
government,
but
within
constitutional
standards
and
limitations.
you
may
have
experimentation,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
this
yesterday,
experimentation
in
the
unit
of
representation,
but
once
that
unit
is
determined,
there
can
be
no
experimentation
in
the
quality
of
representation
from
that
unit.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
did
ask
yesterday
about
a
six
house
legislature.
we
are
talking
about
here
governmental
processes.
we
are
asking
for
equality
in
the
governmental
process.
we
say
you
may
have
a
multimember
executive,
a
counsel.
so
long
as
each
individual
citizen
has
equality
of
representation
and
each
of
the
members
of
that
multimember
executive
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
recall
that
question
yesterday
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i'm
not
aware
or
familiar
with
one
that
does
and
has
any
legislative
power.
but
again,
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well
again
now,
we
--
we
would
not
say
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
would
have
to
look
at
the
method
of
selection
and
the
voice
that
that
counsel
has
because
it
will
take
--
in
a
gray
versus
sanders,
where
you
say
it's
a
unit
wide
election,
it's
election
of
statewide
official.
you
say
that
the
vote
must
count
equal.
let's
just
say
that
they
had
been
nothing
but
direct
counting.
then
you
--
you
remove
at
one
process
and
you
have
a
counting
of
vote
and
then
you
have
a
second
counting
in
which
the
first
votes
are
changed
into
a
new
ratio.
now,
i
think
you
could
apply
that
to
your
counsel
that
you're
speaking
of.
if
the
governor
say,
who
was
elected
directly
by
everyone,
statewide
vote,
should
select
half
of
those
counsel
numbers
and
the
other
half
were
hereditary,
then
that
counsel
would
not
be
constitutional
because
the
citizen
who
had
an
equal
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
governor
was
only
had
an
equal
voice
in
the
selection
of
half
of
the
numbers
of
that
counsel.
the
other
half
he
had
no
participation.
now,
our
point
here
and
so
point
on
appeal
is
that
we
think
that
population
must
be
the
initial
controlling
(inaudible)
and
that
that
must
be
in
every
state
to
the
legislative
process.
if
it's
unicameral,
you
satisfied
it
if
you
have
equal
voice
and
one
house.
if
it's
bicameral
such
as
it
is
in
alabama,
there
must
be
equality
in
each
house
because
both
houses
are
necessary
to
enact
laws.
if
we
have
equal
voice
and
only
one
house
and
no
voice,
and
your
question
yesterday
of
home
rule.
if
you
had
home
rule
for
mobile
county
that
i
represent
here,
if
they
were
just
one
right
such
as
congressional
redistrict
which
will
face
this
court
in
the
next
few
days,
that
is
done
by
the
state
legislature.
we
would
be
deprived
in
mobile
county
of
our
equality
and
the
legislative
process,
if
simply
because
we
had
home
rule
on
everything
but
congressional
districting
did
not
have
an
equal
voice
and
the
legislature
in
the
districting
of
the
state
for
congressional
election.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
your
honor,
that
--
that's
our
point
and
that's
the
reason
that
we
are
not
even
satisfied.
now,
the
other
appellants
are
here
principally
because
of
the
same.
we
concur
on
what
they
say
in
the
senate
but
we
also
do
not
believe
that
the
apportionment
of
the
state
--
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
alabama,
allowing
one
representative
per
county
first,
will
give
us
equality
and
the
legislative
process.
they
figure
that
i
think
it
may
be
a
conflict
but
it's
roughly
a
little
better
than
40%
which
is
about
what
new
york
is
arguing
here
on
this
but
that's
accurate.
the
lower
court
did
comply
without
constitutional
provisions
and
we
say
that
it's
not
necessarily
gross.
we
say
you
start
with
population.
now,
we
recognize
and
--
and
without
disagreement
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
may
not
be
eighth-grade
arithmetic
on
the
first
part,
but
i
believe
that
eighth-grade
arithmetic
will
determine
the
ratio.
now,
which
ratio
and
where
you
stop,
we
recognize
that
this
point
and
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
raised,
the
size
of
the
house.
if
in
alabama
you
take
106,
we
have
3,200,000
people,
you
divide
it,
you
get
a
ratio
of
about
30,000
per
representative.
now,
we
recognize
that
they
will
have
to
be
administrative
deviation
from
an
exact
30,800
per
representative
and
that
there
is
leeway
there.
but
we
won't
go
so
far
to
say
that
that
leeway
must
be
gross
before
the
court
will
strike
it
down.
you
will
look
it
why
the
leeway.
and
if
it
simply
to
keep
one
precinct
from
one
county,
i
mean
taken
out
of
the
county
and
put
in
another
to
equalize
the
legislature
--
the
district,
you
may
say
that
that's
alright.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
become
what
in
the
past
we
have
termed
gross
by
the
court
act,
the
question
of
proportional
voting.
we'd
feel
that
the
state
could
establish
constitutionally
proportional
voting.
we
feel
that
they
could
establish
three
a
house
legislature,
one
on
geography,
one
on
occupation,
one
on
something
else.
but
in
each
house
where
there's
proportional
also,
it
would
have
to
be
that
each
voter
or
each
citizen
in
the
state,
would
have
to
have
equality
in
the
representative
in
each
house.
you
mentioned
management
and
labor.
if
you
could
divide
the
state
of
alabama
into
two
groups,
in
which
management
was
two-third
and
labor
was
one-third,
you
can
have
a
house
made
up
of
occupations
but
two-thirds
would
have
to
be
elected
by
management
and
one-third
by
the
other.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
it
gets
then
and
that's
also
an
important
question,
you
have
these
checks
and
balances.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
necessarily
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
would
say
that
you
had
to
have
the
separation
of
power
that
we've
traditionally
had
between
executive
and
legislature.
but
it
would
say
that
if
you
put
that
power
in
one,
each
citizen
in
the
state
must
have
equality
in
the
selection
and
in
the
voice
of
that
particular
representative,
be
it
governor
or
you
gave
administrative
powers
to
the
legislature.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
would
check
into
that
but
it
does
comes
back
to
the
question
that
was
raised
yesterday
if
i
might
answered
this
way
and
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
i
think
if
the
republican
guarantee
clause
does
have
a
place
here
and
i
don't
--
we
don't
want
to
make
a
case
of
this
as
republican
guarantee
recognizing
the
past
decision
of
the
court
as
to
justice
douglas.
but
we
do
believe
that
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
where
do
we
find
this
in
the
constitution.
the
federal
constitution
mentions
only
one
form
of
government
that
you
can
check
from
the
beginning
to
end
and
that
is
the
republican's
point.
now,
we
say
having
mentioned
then
we
can
look
back,
regards
of
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
guarantee
or
not.
and
i'm
saying
enforce
the
guarantee
but
as
a
measure,
a
stem,
what
type
of
government
and
what
type
of
equal
protection
are
we
talking
about
in
the
fourteenth.
we
can
look
back
to
the
only
point
that
the
constitution
had
mentioned
and
i
don't
believe
that
you'll
find
in
the
federal
state
was
average.
you
will
find
a
discussion
under
the
guarantee
clause
there.
the
question
of
equal
representation,
i
don't
believe
we
find
the
question
nor
division
of
power
between
the
executive
and
the
--
and
the
legislative,
but
you
will
find
and
that
was
not
quoted
though
in
the
appendix
b
that
the
solicitor
general
put
the
--
as
filed
in
the
maryland
case.
federal,
it's
paper
number
39,
i
believe
it
is
that
he
quote,
“does
not
quote
an
early
a
paragraph
in
there
relative
to
equal
representation,
but
that
is
--
our
position
is
that
you
can
experiment
on
the
different
forms
but
there
can
be
no
experimentation
in
which
equality
is
deluded
or
taken
away
that
within
the
governmental
process.”
now,
we're
only
talking
about
one
here,
that's
a
legislative
process.
but
to
us,
it's
unthinkable
that
we
can
speak
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
which
the
citizen
does
not
have
equal
participation
in
that
law.
and
we'd
also
wish
to
emphasize
here
that
there's
a
difference
between
affirmative
and
negative
powers
of
government.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
a
government
isn't
--
that
is
not
able
to
act
is
not
a
just
government.
we've
seen
what
happened
in
alabama
for
failure
to
act
for
60
years.
what
may
have
been
just
in
1901
is
no
long
just
now.
but
what
we
have
here
is
not
protection
of
a
minority
against
the
abuses
of
the
majority.
you
have
minority
control
so
that
there
can
be
no
affirmative
action.
now,
we
think
that
room
for
experimentation
on
the
checks
and
balances
are
the
extraordinary
majorities
under
certain
circumstances
of
providing
even
that
a
bill
would
have
to
pass
82
legislature
in
order
to
provide
time
for
consideration.
but
don't
put
it
in
a
straightjacket
so
that
even
when
a
majority
do
want
a
particular
governmental
policy
that
that
majority
is
not
able
to
transmit
its
desire
into
law.
and
we
say
that
this
is
not
protection
of
minority,
it's
actually
giving
minority
process
which
we
say
is
not
due
process.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
most
certainly
do
when
the
affect
of
that
failure
to
act
results
in
what
it
is
resulted
in,
in
alabama.
it's
certainly
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
and
as
i
said,
we
believe
that
the
--
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
entire
legislative
process
which
in
alabama
is
both
houses
that
we
pointed
out,
you
can
initiate
legislation
in
neither
house
except
the
tax
measure
but
it
requires
both
houses
to
affirm
it
today,
adapt
any
bill
and
therefore
to
give
the
equality
in
one
house
and
to
deny
equality
in
the
second
house
is
to
deny
equality
in
the
entire
legislative
process
because
one-half
of
--
of
equality
does
not
give
you
equality.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
you
mean
if
we
followed
the
--
the
wording
of
the
1901
constitution?
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
maintain
that
you
could
not,
your
honor,
in
the
house.
now,
we
concur
in
the
other
appellant's
argument
of
the
interpretation
that
could
be
given
to
the
senate
provision
which
we
think
would
square
that
without
declaring
unconstitutional.
but
in
a
house
where
you
have
a
provision
that
each
county
must
have
at
least
one
representative
then
we
maintain,
and
as
attorney
general
pointed
out,
the
court
gave
appellate
a
method
we
think
is
fair,
the
method
of
equal
proportions
in
alighting,
the
representative
--
the
house
of
representative.
but
even
then,
houston
county
had
one
representative
of
50,000.
coosa
county
with
only
10,000
populations
has
one
representative.
that's
the
worse
five
to
one
ratio
even
with
what
we
say
is
a
fair
method.
but
once
you
start
by
giving
67
representatives
to
the
existing
67
county
in
one
each,
then
you
make
it
impossible
to
give
equality
of
representation
in
remaining
seats.
now,
we
also
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
effect
that
the
legislature
can
achieve
the
67-senator
amendment
simply
by
legislative
act.
the
constitution
provides
an
upper
limit
on
the
size
of
the
house
but
no
lower
limit.
they
could
provide,
therefore,
a
house
of
67
numbers
in
which
then
each
county
would
be
entitled
to
one.
you
would
end
up
with
a
67
number
house
in
which
the
largest
would
have
a
population
of
634,000,
the
smallest
count.
now,
we
believe
that
the
constitutional
convention
in
1901
in
alabama,
if
you
look
at
the
proceedings
and
we've
cited
them
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
at
pages
to
constitutional
convention.
if
you
look
at
the
provisions
themselves
throughout
the
delegates
to
that
convention
recognized
that
fairness
of
population.
every
provision
even
down
to
the
formation
of
new
counties,
they
have
a
provision
in
there
that
no
county
could
be
formed
unless
it
had
enough
people
in
the
new
county
to
the
ratio
of
population
to
give
it
one
representative
or
it
left
the
old
county
or
counties
from
which
he
was
taken
with
a
ratio
of
representation
and
tying
it
into
one,
so
that
they
even
thought
about
this
thing
have
taken
in
new
counties.
they
couldn't
delude
to
vote
unless
that
new
county
came
in
with
a
population
sufficient
to
entitle
it
to
at
least
one
representative.
but
to
your
question
chief
justice,
we
do
not
believe
that
on
the
house
that
the
--
in
conformity
with
the
provision
of
alabama
constitution
would
meet
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
we,
as
i
said,
asked
the
lower
court
to
declare
this
in
it's
--
in
our
original
petition
to
declare
these
guidelines
regardless,
as
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
out
here.
there
is
--
well,
as
we've
seen
in
--
in
the
state
of
alabama
in
this
brief
here,
in
his
brief
has
pointed
out
that
one
session
of
legislature
is
going
back
with
this
reapportion
legislation
that
didn't
get
anywhere
with
a
further
reapportion.
now,
we
believe
in
and
not
only
is
full
of
action
necessary
and
we
do
recognize
that
including
paragraph
of
the
court,
if
the
court
and
in
--
by
the
strong
language
as
--
as
it
could
stated
that
it
was
going
to
do
something
if
the
legislature
did.
but
we
do
believe
that
either
the
lower
court
on
the
legislature
needs
a
guideline,
a
criteria,
a
standard
by
which
to
measure
what
they
do
and
what
they
must
do
in
order
to
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
think
that
the
wording
as
contained
in
this
section
of
alabama
constitution,
about
constitutional
amendment
in
which
they
wrote
in
that
population
shall
be
the
basis
of
representation
and
that
it
cannot
be
changed
by
constitutional
amendment.
in
there,
it
says
“as
nearly
as
maybe”
and
we
think
that
although
we're
argue
in
numbers
but
numbers
is
a
safe
guide
here
for
determining
of
whether
or
not
we
meet
that
standards.
but
we
don't
say
mathematical
exactitude
is
necessary,
in
other
words,
as
nearly
as
maybe,
in
the
perfect
setup
and
election
at
large,
every
man's
vote
counts
to
one.
if
you
break
that
down
into
two
districts
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
that
in
applying
to
--
i
agree
with
the
others
that
we
would
have
chaos
if
you
had
to
elect
106
members
of
the
house
and
35
members
of
the
state.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
of
course
then
--
and
this
is
another
reason
that
we
emphasize
and
it
run
through
the
thread
of
the
new
york
case,
i
only
speak
for
alabama.
but
we
emphasize
they
were
here
for
an
individual,
there
are
many
people
in
my
county,
many
people
in
jackson
county
who
are
happy
with
the
rural
domination
of
the
legislature.
so
we're
not
unanimous
in
this.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
i
say
most
truly
republican.
they
don't
like
these
taxes
that
it
comes
out
but
they
may
like
some
of
those
right
now.
we
pay
more
than
our
shared
taxes
and
--
than
--
than
the
rest
of
the
state
but
that's
just
a
sort
of
tribute
you
pay
to
get
other
types
of
laws
with
which
they
do
agree,
but
that's
just
facing
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
now.
you've
got
into
proportional
representation
that
you
mentioned.
if
there
might
be
some
way.
i
say
that
you
can
experiment
there.
but
regardless
of
how
you
do
it,
you've
still
got
to
end
up
when
the
representative
gets
there,
he
must
represent
either
an
equal
number
or
each
person
must
have
an
equal
share
of
representative
of
either
way
you
want
to
put
it.
now,
this
proportion
of
voting
that
you
mentioned
that
was
proposed.
the
court
asked
amicus
brief
in
this
--
on
proportional
voting
in
the
legislature.
we
opposed
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
you
ask
about
committee
assignments,
another,
the
filibuster.
there
are
many
ways
but
the
same
token,
we
think
that
it
would
be
unfair
if
you
gave
jackson
county
and
mobile
county
the
proper
number
of
representatives
and
senators
then
after
they've
got
that,
told
them
they
had
to
vote
by
county.
supposed
we've
got
seven
then
you
said,
“alright
now,
you
can
go
to
where
you're
committed,
you
can
filibuster
but
when
it
comes
to
voting,
we're
going
to
have
a
unit
room,”
which
we
think.
and
--
and
that's
a
--
a
perfect
illustration
of
what
we
say
is
--
is
a
denial
of
--
of
equality
in
the
legislative
process.
but
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
in
both
houses
and
although
we
do
not
right
to
argue
that
our
constitutional
provision
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
do
believe
that
there
is
not
any
principle
that
can
apply
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
we
don't
have
near
the
urban
characteristics
in
new
york.
it's
pointed
out
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
non-largest
counties
here
in
alabama
have
just
about
50%
of
the
population.
and
those
nine
are
from
one
any
state
of
the
other,
and
do
not
necessarily
represent
common
interest
or
common
views
and
would
probably
not
act
together
or
would
rarely
act
together.
but
we
believe
that
the
present
constitutional
provision
with
regard
to
house
of
representative
in
alabama
does
not
meet
the
standard
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
we
believe
that
either
this
court
should
so
declare
by
the
lower
court
in
the
act.
now,
we
--
my
particular
appellants
recommend
a
solution
to
that,
it's
an
experimentation
in
the
type
of
unit
but
it
ends
up
with
equality
of
representation.
it
maybe
a
little
difficult
to
administer,
but
we
think
there's
even
a
way
that
you
can
conform
to
the
alabama
requirements
and
give
equality
in
the
house
of
representatives.
but
we
say
--
what
we
ask
here
is
that
this
court
set
out
the
standard
and
the
guidelines
for
either
the
legislature
or
the
lower
court
to
follow
an
apportionment
but
that
basic
to
it
must
be
--
and
this
was
a
thing
that
worked
when
they
cited
fortson,
a
georgia
case
and
even
show
diverse
is
higher
and
others.
a
question
in
the
court's
man
has
to
whether
or
not
both
houses
or
the
bicameral
legislature
had
to
be
apportioned
to
give
equality
of
representation
in
each
house.
and
it
was
that
type
of
language
that
concerned
by
the
lower
court
was
the
principle
reason
what
appeared
here
because
we
believe
that
you
do
not
satisfy
any
bicameral
legislature
unless
you
have
equality
of
representation
in
both.
now,
we
take
it
from
gray
versus
sanders
that
starts
out
with
the
idea
of
“one
man
one
vote
in
a
statewide"
but
we
do
not
believe
that
simply
by
raising
it
to
another
level,
to
a
representative
that
you
can
dilute
that
equality
that
you
started
with
in
the
governmental
process,
here
the
legislative
process,
deluded
by
passing
it
through
something
that
makes
you
come
out
with
a
different
ratio
or
a
different
percentage
at
the
next
level.
just
as
a
county
unit
after
all,
suppose
they
had
elected
people
statewide
just,
like
the
electors
on
the
federal.
those
electors
then
in
georgia
would
have
had
a
certain
number
of
votes
based
on
the
country
units.
we
would
have
--
the
georgia
voter
would
have
had
equality
in
selecting
elector
but
that
equality
in
the
final
analysis
would
have
been
taken
away.
but
we
--
we
urge
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
applies
to
houses
of
a
bicameral
legislature.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
see.
i
--
i
would
be
glad
to
see
gray
versus
sanders.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
won't
say
it
determines
it
but
i
certainly
think
that
if
you
start
with
the
proposition
the
--
there
that
in
a
statewide
office
that
each
vote
should
count
as
one,
i
think
that
it
end
in
one.
because
that's
basic
and
the
idea
of
self
government
on
a
representative
government
that
each
citizen
has
equal
and
that
participation
and
the
only
way
you
can
carry
that
over
into
the
legislature
is
to
make
that
equality
start
with
a
vote
for
the
representative
and
in
the
voice
of
the
representative
and
the
legislature.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
but
we
start
and
gray
versus
sanders
said
that
you
must
give
each
constituent
in
that
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
but
as
i
said,
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
alabama.
i
may
live
in
the
county
of
mobile.
i
am
representative
in
a
legislature
that
makes
laws
for
the
entire
state.
now,
if
my
voice
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
have
representatives
but
when
they
get
to
the
lawmaking
body
in
montgomery,
they
speak
with
a
voice
on
equal
to
that
are
the
adjacent
county.
i
can
move
across
the
county
lines,
suddenly
my
participation
change
in
material.
but
i
am
first
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
alabama,
i
am
subject
to
laws
made
by
one
legislature
and
all
i
ask
as
a
citizen
is
equal
participation
in
that
lawmaking
process.
i
believe
my
time
up
--
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
i
would
like
first
mr.
justice
white
that
this
court
declared
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
sets
up
first
a
standard
of
population
which
can
be
deviated
from
only
under
most
compelling,
and
i
would
even
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
don't
think
it
went
far
enough.
but
i
think
that
as
mr.
vann
said
earlier
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
not
to
go
back
to
the
one
part
of
that
but
to
go
far
with
the
one
that
would
comply
with
a
guideline
that
this
court
would
set
out,
namely
they
both
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
that
--
that
was
--
is
what
we
would
answer.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
population
equal.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
as
to
both
houses,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
certainly
do
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
do
because
in
a
house,
it
would
still
give
only
40%.
and
if
you
look
at
the
tables,
tasks
of
the
court's
opinion,
it
shows
a
trend
of
population
is
going
to
get
worse
rather
than
better
and
that
this
40%
may
go
down.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
oh
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
i
agree
and
--
and
i
commend
the
court
after
all
it
was
a
pioneering
in
a
new
field.
and
i'm
not
criticizing
the
court
for
not
going
any
further.
i
wanted
too
and
i
want
this
court
too
because
simply
regarded,
it
didn't
go
far
enough
but
i
--
i
approve
of
what
they
did
but
i
ask
for
more.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes
sir,
to
this
extent
under
the
law
that
mr.
vann
mentioned
in
his
interstate.
he
looked
--
they
provided
machinery
for
just
this
thing,
so
that
if
any
vacancies,
you
simply
have
an
election
in
those
counties
or
district
which
there
is
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
complete
turnover.
in
fact,
the
invalidation
of
the
way
of
crawford
and
in
the
senate
resulted
in
only
one
election
for
assumption.
but
if
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
special
election.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
though
it's
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
subsequent
to
the
meeting
of
the
legislature,
no
your
honor.
the
legislature
adjourned
in
september
of
this
case,
it
already
had
been
set
down
and
--
and
as
far
as
i
know,
no
effort
has
been
made
in
the
lower
court
since
the
adjournment
of
the
legislature.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that
is
what
troubled
us
your
honor
in
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
because
if
you
noticed
on
page
151
of
the
record,
it
says
the
result
may
well
be
that
representation
of
court
in
a
population
to
some
extent
and
the
court
italicized
that
in
its
opinion
to
some
extent
must
be
required
in
both
houses
and
it
italicized
both,
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there,
if
invidious
discrimination,
the
legislative
systems
as
a
whole.
now,
when
we
agreed
with
that
as
a
whole,
but
this
to
some
extent,
worries
me
because
i
think
that
the
court
maybe
as
the
attorney
general
would
be
satisfied
with
the
house
being
apportioned
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
1901
constitution
and
the
way
of
proper
--
or
the
67-senator
provision.
that
i
would
read
that,
it's
not
clear
but
i
--
i
think
it's
open
to
that
inference.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
one
of
the
footnotes
we
just
point
out
that
out
of
67
counties,
only
27
had
a
population
in
excess
of
the
ratio
of
30,000
per
representative,
if
you
divide
106
in
their
population,
only
27
would
be
entitled
to
one.
the
remaining
14
except
for
a
few,
some
of
them
are
closed
to
the
line
and
you
might
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
it
would
have
to
be
floterial
district
and
so
it
would
be
over
half
of
the
counties.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
would
not
have
a
single
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
they
would
have
a
representative
but
not
elected
by
them
solely.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
thank
you.
