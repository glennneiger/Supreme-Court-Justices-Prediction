justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
thus
far
as
what
you're
suggesting
is
abstractly,
with
the
alabama
constitutional
formulation,
if
executed,
if
executed,
satisfies
the
requirements
needed
to
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
get
back
to
the
moment
to
the
67
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
senator
amendment.
i
gather,
if
i
understand
your
brief
correctly,
your
difficulty
is
that
there
is
not
only
one
senator
for
each
of
the
67
counties
but
also
at
least
one
representative
for
each
of
the
67
counties
leaving
in
the
lower
house
only
some
39
sets
to
the
apportion
on
population.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
--
but
let
me
put
the
question
this
way.
if
the
entire
lower
house
proportioned
on
the
population,
would
you
have
any
difficulty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
i
still
get
in
trouble?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
had
to
be
some
kind
of
population
basis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
in
the
choice
of
senate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
might
also
follow
that
if
in
the
upper
house,
it
took
say
55%
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
senator.
let
assume
it
had
all
got
all
the
better
than
50.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
alright,
50
or
whatever
it
is,
it
kept
the
very
high
figure
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
might
still
say
that
the
requirement
of
a
single
senator
--
of
--
the
assurance
of
one
assembly
man
in
the
lower
house
might
still
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suppose
the
remainder
instead
--
supposed
to
--
as
supposed
we
--
we
assumed
in
the
upper
house
with
50%
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
like
the
majority.
but
you
have
a
lower
house
not
of
a
105
is
here
with
only
39
out
of
my
list
if
it's
any
good.of
course
and
according
to
population
which
had
an
upper
house
say
of
150
for
which
it
had
75
or
80
according
to
population
even
though
there
was
one
assured
to
each
county
in
the
lower
house.
