et

mr.
pitts,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
should
we
have
to
wait
from
1901
beyond
1960?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
though
that
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
court
had
no
--
had
no
right
to
the
coerce
the
legislature
into
doing
that
although
it
had
--
it
had
for
60
years
failed
to
follow
its
own
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
honestly
say
that
that
even
though
it
went
another
60
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
that
it's
justiciable
over
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pitts,
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
the
court
had
the
right
to
declare
your
apportionment
unconstitutional,
what
remedy
could
it
use
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
order
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
--
to
say
that
people
did
have
their
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
you
were.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it
would
be
a
right
without
a
remedy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
attorney
general
flowers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
i
thought
i
read
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
your
supreme
court
had
interpreted
that
to
mean
that
while
the
legislature
could
not
submit
an
amendment
to
the
constitution,
it
could
be
amended
through
constitutional
convention.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
just
want
to
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
it
your
positions
that
the
legislature
could
or
could
not
adequately
apportion
--
reapportion
the
legislator
--
the
legislature
under
the
1901
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
1901?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
hasn't
the
district
court
done
that?
hasn't
the
district
court
done
that,
put
it
back
to
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
morgan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
morgan,
is
it
possible
under
your
constitutional
provision
of
1901
to
beat
that
standard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
could
be
done
without
--
without
gross
inequalities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
speaking
about
it
permanently
because
that's
the
question
that
attorney
general
posed
to
us
whether
he
would
like
to
have
us
say
whether
or
not
under
that
constitutional
provision
in
1901,
it
is
possible
for
the
legislature
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
vann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
and
why
did
they
change
that
1814
provision
you
just
read?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
did
the
supreme
court
give
its
advisory
opinion
with
the
--
this
meant
that
it
couldn't
have
two
counties
in
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
wasn't
submitted
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.

chief
justice
earl

the
1901
provision,
