mr.
james
p.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
which
we
are
about
to
argue
has
been
variously
described
as
a
contempt
case
and
in
the
monday's
washington
post
under
the
calendar,
it
was
described
as
a
runaway
construction
case.
actually,
what
we
are
here
involved
with
is
a
question
which
i
believe
is
of
great
importance
federally
because
we
are
involved
not
so
much
with
contempt
but
with
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
briefly,
how
this
case
arose,
in
april
of
1961,
a
group
of
people,
small
people,
little
people
who
live
in
the
neighborhood
of
love
field,
a
municipal
airport
in
the
city
of
dallas,
texas,
retained
counsel
in
an
effort
to
stop
the
expansion
of
that
field
and
the
construction
of
a
new
runway
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
jet
traffic
over
their
homes.
46
people
were
involved.we
filed
an
action
in
the
state
court
of
texas,
the
district
court,
praying
for
an
injunction
against
such
construction.
as
grounds
for
that
injunction,
we
offered
the
texas
constitution
and
its
prohibition
against
seizure
or
damage
to
property
without
compensation
in
advance.
in
the
course
of
the
temporary
hearing,
we
discovered
that
he
was
proposed
to
support
this
and
finance
this
new
runway
by
the
issue
of
revenue
bonds.
there
had
been
no
elections
so
we
amended
our
pleading
and
included
that
as
a
ground,
an
additional
ground
for
an
injunction.
in
other
words,
the
issuance,
proposed
issuance
of
revenue
bonds
without
having
submitted
the
proposition
to
an
election
as
required
by
texas
law.
we
had
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
granted
against
the
plaintiffs.
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
which
reviewed
the
case
and
rendered
decisions
supporting
or
sustaining
the
summary
judgment.
we
then
applied
for
writ
of
error
to
a
texas
supreme
court
which
writ
of
error
was
denied,
no
reversible
error.
we
consider
that
the
in
re
portion
of
the
supreme
court
decision
is
important
because
of
the
rule
in
texas
which
states
that
where
a
decision,
where
the
court,
the
supreme
court
is
in
accord
with
the
result
of
the
case,
whether
it's
not
wholly
satisfied
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
has
correctly
declared
the
law,
then
it
is
a
reversible
refused,
no
reversible
error
decision.
in
other
words,
the
result
is
right
but
the
court
of
the
--
the
supreme
court
is
not
in
agreement
on
all
points
of
law
mentioned
in
the
opinion,
which
we
believe
is
important
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it
isn't
--
no,
we
have
a
--
an
affirmance
in
the
rules
too
where
we
have
an
affirmance
that
affirms
the
law
stated
in
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it
affirms
the
judgment
but
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
not
for
the
reasons
--
not
necessarily
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
there
is
a
--
there
is
another
ruling
error
refused,
period.
that's
--
that's
the
whole
thing.
that
means
that
the
law
and
the
decision
and
the
judgment
are
correct.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it
--
it
is
for
practical
fact.
it's
--
it's
an
affirmance.
but
the
type
of
affirmance
is
different.
the
error
refused
to
be
the
same
as
if
the
court
said
affirm.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
there
is
no
way.
so
that
--
that
--
we
were
incidentally
denied
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
original
decision
of
the
supreme
court
which
denied
or
affirmed
the
judgment
rather,
no
reversible
error.
following
that
action,
we
applied
to
this
court
for
review
on
certiorari.
during
the
period
of
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
the
case
of
griggs
against
allegheny
county
had
been
decided
by
this
court
and
the
decision
handed
down
and
it
was
upon
the
basis
of
that
case
so
we
came
here
for
relief.
however,
that
relief
was
refused.
we
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
went
back
to
texas.
in
the
decision
of
the
court
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
the
class
is,
perhaps,
important
because
in
the
original
suit,
the
class
was
described
as
"the
homeowners,
families
and
individuals
who
live,
work,
reside
and
attend
schools,
churches
and
other
community
centers
in
the
area
embraced
with
the
approach
areas
of
planned
runway,
1331
(l).
actually,
the
type
of
class
is
important
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
taxpayer's
action
even
though
people
that
were
involved
in
the
suit
were
taxpayers.
now,
then
in
the
interim,
the
action
was
pretty
fast
in
this
case.
the
suit
was
filed
april
3rd,
summary
judgment
rendered
july
16,
1961,
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
in
july
of
1962.
and
the
motion
for
rehearing
was
denied
in
october
1962.
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals'
opinion,
on
the
question
of
the
injunction
predicated
on
the
proposed
issue
bonds
the
court
stated
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
the
injunction
and
that
no
election
was
required
on
those
bonds.
however,
on
examination
of
the
authority
cited
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
established
that
the
case
has
cited
held
that
under
the
law
of
texas,
it
was
not
possible
to
enjoin
a
proposed
issue
of
bonds
that
the
remedy
available
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
citizen
was
to
go
in
to
court
after
the
bonds
had
been
issued.
the
rule
says
that
the
only
way
that
you
can
attack
it
is
to
go
in
and
seek
to
enjoin
the
payment
of
bonds.
the
idea
behind
the
rule
is
stated
in
those
cases
that
if
a
bond
issue
is
void,
then
there
is
no
damage
to
the
taxpayer,
therefore,
an
injunction
of
a
proposed
issue
will
not
be
granted.
so
in
that
situation
reviewing
the
law
and
having
learn
the
considerable
amount
about
the
operation
and
the
interim
between
the
beginning
of
the
suit
and
the
determination
of
the
appeals,
30
of
the
original
plaintiffs
in
the
atkinson
case
which
was
the
first
suit,
joined
by
another
92
plaintiffs
who
were
not
in
the
first
suit,
brought
an
action
in
federal
court
which
we
refer
to
here
as
the
brown
case.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
to
straight
--
to
straighten
all
on
our
suit,
it
was
actually
filed
april
3rd,
1961.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
about
the
10th
of
april,
we
had
a
temporary
hearing,
our
hearing
and
an
application
of
a
temporary
injunction.
following
that
application,
the
city,
which
was
the
only
defendant,
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
plaintiffs
or
petitioners
then
filed
an
amended
complaint
which
was
june
23rd,
1961.
and
the
amended
complaint
is
the
one
that
we
were
heard
on
and
the
judgment
was
granted
on.
now,
then,
in
the
federal
action,
we
had
not
only
some
90
new
plaintiffs
who
were
not
involved
in
the
original
atkinson
state
suit
but
we
also
had
a
new
group
of
defendants.
we
have
the
original
defendant,
the
only
common
defendant
to
the
atkinson
and
brown
case,
the
city
of
dallas.
we
join
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas
because
of
his
obligation
under
law
to
certify
to
the
legal
issuance
of
bonds.
we
join
the
mayor,
the
city
manager,
the
city
auditor,
treasurer,
secretary
and
counsel
of
the
city
of
dallas
because
of
their
activities
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
bonds
and
a
bond
issue
which
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
institution
of
the
original
case.
we
join
--
join
the
bond
house
which
was
handling
the
distribution
sale
of
these
bonds
and
we
join
the
bond
attorneys
upon
whose
advised
these
bonds
were
being
offered
to
the
public.
so
that
we
had
a
very
wide
difference
in
parties
in
the
first
action
and
in
the
--
in
the
state
action
and
then
the
action
subsequently
filed
in
the
federal
court.
now,
the
federal
action
was
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
because
they
did
not
sue
as
taxpayers.
his
second
action
was
not
a
class
action.
the
first
action
in
the
state
suit
claim
to
represent
not
the
taxpayers
in
the
city
of
dallas
but
to
represent
the
homeowners,
the
families
and
the
individuals
who
live,
work,
reside
and
attend
schools
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
this
--
the
class
represented
in
the
first
action
were
the
homeowners,
families
and
individuals
who
live,
work,
reside
and
attend
schools,
churches
and
other
community
centers
in
the
area
embraced
within
the
approach
areas
of
plan
runaway
of
13r-31l.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
plaintiffs
in
the
second
were
122
individuals
who
sought
to
represent
themselves,
all
of
whom
were
taxpayers.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
they
live
in
the
area
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
they
were
a
part
of
the
class
in
the
first
action
except
that
they
were
--
our
first
action
was
not
a
taxpayer's
action
and
our
first
action
did
not
attack
any
outstanding
bonds
because
of
the
fact
that
there
were
no
bond
owners
represented
as
defendants.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
i
would,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
when
a
group
of
people
--
i
mean
these
were
not
necessarily
taxpayers,
not
first
class.
we
had
every
type
of
person
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
about
defendants.
well,
the
only
common
defendant
we
have
is
the
city
of
dallas
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
and
i
think
that
the
addition
of
the
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
would
say
that
still
there
would
be
no
application
of
res
judicata
because
there
was
no
privity
of
parties.
we
were
not
suing
the
same
party
or
--
nor
were
we're
suing
persons
who
were
in
privity
with
that
party.
in
other
words,
we
have
attorneys
and
bond
houses
and
everything
in
the
second
suit
that
we
didn't
have
in
the
first.
now,
the
prayer
for
relief
in
the
second
suit
may
help
answer
your
question
on
that
point
because
in
the
second
suit,
we
--
we
braced
our
action
on
the
civil
rights
law
title
42.
we
also
--
we
predicated
that
upon
the
denial
of
the
election
provided
by
statute,
article
46
(d)
(9)
of
the
statute
to
texas.
we
also
pleaded
that
the
construction
of
an
airway
--
airport
runway
in
violation
of
the
united
states
statutes
and
regulations
adopted
pursuant
thereto
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
then
further,
we
charge
that
the
action
of
these
defendants
involving
an
issue
which
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
when
the
state
suit
was
in
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
the
united
states
and
was
in
violation
of
the
postal
laws
because
of
the
circulation
of
false
and
fraudulent
statements
relative
to
the
sale
of
bonds.
now
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
none
of
those
were
raised
in
the
first
suit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
constitutional
question
of
the
first
suit
was
the
seizure
of
property
without
--
without
compensation.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it's
also
raised
in
the
second
suit
merely
for
the
purposes
joined
special
interest.
now,
in
addition
to
that
fact,
the
original
judgment
was
entered
on
july
16,
1961.
the
federal
action
was
not
brought
until
september
of
1962
and
in
the
interim,
there
were
considerable
changes
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
under
the
federal
rules
which
do
not
require
you
to
--
to
plead
evidence.
it
is
impractical
and
impossible
to
determine
an
issue
as
being
a
matter
of
fact
submitted
in
a
prior
judgment
because
it's
pleading
to
plead
your
evidence
and
without
particular
reference
to
identical
regulations
and
things
you
cannot
say
that
a
matter
is
res
judicata.
then
he
went
--
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
on
september
24th
and
on
september
25th,
the
city
of
dallas
came
in
appearing
for
all
defendants
in
the
action
and
filed
what
they
designated
as
a
motion
to
advance.
in
that
pleading,
they
pleaded
the
atkinson
case
as
res
judicata
and
asked
for
an
immediate
trial
on
the
merits.
apparently,
they
changed
their
mind
about
wanting
to
contest
the
merits
of
our
suit
because
on
october
6,
they
went
to
the
court
state
of
appeals,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas
and
filed
an
application
for
what
they
call
a
writ
of
prohibition.
now,
that
application
was
directed
to
all
of
the
defendants
--
all
of
the
petitioners
in
the
brown
case
and
to
the
attorney
for
the
browns.
it
did
not
join
the
federal
judge,
although
under
the
texas
law,
the
normal
practice
under
writ
of
prohibition
is
to
direct
that
writ
to
a
judge
itself.
we
were
in
federal
court
on
october
10th
after
this
application
to
the
state
court.
we
went
to
the
district
judge
and
we
filed
an
application
for
injunction.
we
said,
"we
have
here
of
course
before
this
court,
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
we
want
this
court
to
protect
this
jurisdiction
and
give
us
a
trial
before
it.
we
therefore
asked
that
you
enjoin
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
from
any
interference
and
that,"
i
beg
your
pardon,
"and
that
action
was
only
the
court
of
civil
appeals
from
interfering
with
our
federal
suit.
we
want
a
federal
trial."
strangely
enough,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
adopted
the
answer
filed
by
the
defendants
in
the
brown
case
and
came
in
and
said
that
the
--
the
cause
of
the
defendants
was
right
even
they
were
going
to
hear
us
within
four
days
but
they
joined
in
the
general
answer
filed
and
the
federal
judge
turned
down
our
application
for
injunction
stating
that
she
had
confidence
in
the
state
court
to
do
the
right
thing
and
that
as
a
matter
of
comity,
she
let
them
continue.
we
therefore
went
in
the
court,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
on
this
application
for
writ
of
prohibition.
we
filed
an
application
to
disqualify
the
court
on
the
ground
that
it
had
intervened
the
federal
action
and
prejudged
the
case.
that
application
was
denied.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no
sir,
not
at
this
point.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
later.
so
that
we
went
into
the
argument
on
the
prohibition
case,
the
court
heard
us,
there
was
a
full
hearing,
we
moot
to
deny
the
writ
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
entered
judgment
in
substance
stating
in
their
opinion
that
the
filing
of
the
federal
suit
did
not
interfere
with
the
judgment
in
the
original
atkinson
case,
which
it's
agreed
was
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
now,
under
texas
law,
it
is
agreed
that
that
judgment
was
final.
there
was
no
appeal
from
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
judgment
was
december
16,
i
believe.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it's
in
the
record.
i
don't
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
will
check,
your
honor,
i'll
find
it
over
my
hands
right
away.
in
any
event,
that
judgment
became
final
and
there
was
no
more
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
then,
instead
of
accepting
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
as
the
final
judgment
from
which
there
was
no
appeal,
the
city
then
applied
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
reverse
the
judgment,
the
final
judgment
from
which
there
was
no
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
to
order
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiffs
in
the
brown
case
and
all
of
those
plaintiffs
to
drop
their
suits
in
federal
court.
we
argued
on
that
writ
of
mandamus.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
only
authority,
legal
authority
in
--
in
the
texas
constitutional
laws
was
for
that
court
to
issue
a
mandamus
in
accordance
with
the
principles
agreeable
to
law
or
agreeable
principles
of
law.
a
final
judgment
involves
judicial
discretion
and
has
been
held
in
the
50
states
of
this
union
that
a
mandamus
will
not
or
issued
order
a
discretionary
act
performed.
it
may
order
the
act
performed
but
it
will
not
dictate
the
manner
in
which
the
act
shall
be
performed.
so
that
on
that
basis,
there
was
no
authority
in
the
court
to
issue
such
a
writ.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
general
question
over
the
united
states.
the
--
the
statute
itself
says
agreeable
to
principles
of
law.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
that
--
in
that
sense
it
is.
it's
--
it's
better
state
statute
affecting
jurisdiction
which
establishes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
that
--
to
that
extent
it
is
state
law
but
i
think
the
term
agreeable
to
principles
of
law
would
involve
the
law
of
the
united
states
of
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
--
general
acceptance.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
think
not,
your
honor,
when
that
interpretation
applies
in
basis
of
--
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
because
if,
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it's
--
it
--
this
law
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i'm
not
wholly
in
accord
with
their
position,
your
honor,
for
this
reason
that
if
a
court
can
wholly
ignore
a
state
statute
and
render
a
decision
contrary
to
common
sense
and
reason,
i
don't
think
this
court
is
bound
by
such
an
act
because
if
it
were,
then
we
can
--
of
due
process
can
be
avoided
by
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
believe
that
you
can
when
it
becomes
such
a
distorted
interpretation
that
it
is
not
logical
or
reasonable.
in
other
words
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
i
think
the
big
question
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
--
i
think
the
big
question
is
the
violation
of
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
then,
after
the
hearing
in
the
federal
court
--
in
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
texas,
the
mandamus
was
conditionally
issued.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
was
in
substance
each
ordered
to
issue
whatever
writs
were
necessary
to
stop
us
from
continuing
any
further
litigation
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
condition
being
that
--
unless
the
lower
court
did
issue
these
writs,
they
would
issue
the
writ
of
mandamus.
in
other
words,
they
don't
issue
their
writ.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
part
of
it,
yes.
there's
--
it
involves
further
action.
we
--
that
came
as
a
result
of
this
judgment.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
--
which
is
here
for
review.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
that's
--
this
is
one
of
them.
in
other
words,
they
said,
this
--
the
city
is
entitled
to
its
--
its
writ
of
prohibition.
in
the
judgment,
they
said
that
--
i
pointed
out
and
i
had
pointed
out
an
argument
that
there
was
no
judge
involved.
and
the
supreme
court
disposed
of
that
by
saying
that's
a
technical
rule
of
law
so
we'll
just
set
it
aside.
well,
it
maybe
technical
but
the
legal
effects
are
different.
out
of
an
injunction,
you
have
to
prove
something
irreparable
damage
and
things
like
that.
on
the
writ
of
prohibition,
you
don't
have
to
do
that,
you
just
show
the
judge
not
doing
his
job.
so
they
ignored
this
technical
rule
of
law.
now,
then
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
judges
must
follow
that,
mr.
associate
justice
clark.
following
this
supreme
court
judgment,
the
--
a
copy
thereof
was
sent
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
without
notice
to
the
petitioners,
issued
what
they
call
a
"writ
of
prohibition".
now,
it's
clear
on
the
record
that
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
that's
--
that's
here
before
the
court,
the
so-called
"writ
of
prohibition".
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
that's
been
appealed
too.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no.
no,
it
was
not
an
appeal.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
it
was
a
final
decision.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
they
did
what
the
supreme
court
told
them
to
do.
but
there
was
no
appellate
jurisdiction
by
which
we
could
appeal.
that
--
the
original
writ
of
prohibition
was
supposed
to
be
final
and
that
was
reversed
by
a
mandamus
and
then
we
had
no
place
to
go
after
the
second
one
--
second
judgment.
the
original
judgment
was
reversed
without
notice
to
anybody.
the
judge
signed
an
order
which
was
not
tested
by
the
clerk,
which
did
not
bear
the
seal
of
the
clerk
and
which
was
not
mailed
--
it
was
mailed
out
to
everybody
with
no
personal
service.
that
order
was
sweepy.
it
prohibited
the
attorney
and
all
the
parties
involved
from
bringing
action
anywhere
and
anyway
interfering
with
the
construction
of
this
runway.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
the
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
they
paid
no
attention
to
it.
they
told
us
to
--
to
stop
prosecution
of
the
federal
suit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
think
they
could.
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
page
8
of
their
brief,
they
showed
that
on
the
day
the
suit
was
filed,
this
federal
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court
september
24th,
1962,
that
there
was
pending
in
this
court
the
motion
for
rehearing.
so
they
were
going
ahead
with
the
sale
on
september
24th
when
this
court
did
not
turn
us
down
finally
until
october
12th,
1962.
so
that
my
belief
is
that
much
of
this
is
just
to
avoid
a
hearing
on
the
merits
because
the
facts
in
the
record
show
that
this
argument
brought
harassments
and
delay
does
not
apply.
they
prove
it
themselves.
the
action
was
not
good
to
stop
it,
as
far
as
i
know
they
sold
the
bonds.
but
we
didn't
stop
there.
we
went
to
the
federal
court
again
and
we
filed
an
application,
an
independent
suit
for
injunction,
that's
here
on
review
too,
again
with
the
federal
district
judge
saying
judge
that
court
--
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals
had
tried
to
decide
this
lawsuit.
we
are
here
before
your
court,
the
defendants
have
submitted
the
jurisdiction.
we
want
a
trial
by
the
federal
court,
not
the
state
courts
and
we
ask
you
to
enjoin
these
two
courts
from
any
further
interference.
now,
the
judge
turned
us
down
on
temporary
injunction
and
gave
us
a
hearing,
and
we
have
that
hearing
in
federal
courts
in
the
record
and
that
the
cause
of
the
--
of
the
hearing,
the
court
dismissed
the
case
first
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot.
i've
skipped
the
page
here
because
going
back
to
the
brown
case,
a
minute
this
writ
of
prohibition
was
--
was
filed
and
signed
by
the
state
court,
the
city
then
went
into
federal
court
on
the
brown
action
and
moved
for
a
hearing,
for
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
filed
a
supplemental
motion
pointing
out
that
we
are
under
injunction
from
the
state
court.
the
court
heard
the
brown
case
first
even
though
we
were
trying
to
get
a
temporary
injunction
against
interference.
and
from
the
clause
of
the
hearing
state
that
we
were
under
prohibition
against
further
prosecution
and
therefore,
she
was
going
to
dismiss
the
case
which
he
did.now
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
judge
hughes.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
she
stated
as
i
read
that
record
that
that
was
the
finding
of
the
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
we
have
called
your
attention
to
that
section
which
you
--
you
say
that
she
held
it
was
res
judicata.
she
said
the
issues
that
are
sought
to
be
litigated
in
the
case
in
the
federal
court
have
been
held
by
the
supreme
court
to
be
the
same
as
the
issues
which
have
been
litigated
in
the
atkinson
case.
well,
now,
that's
a
holding
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
we
didn't
want
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
on
this.
we
wanted
it
from
the
federal
court,
which
had
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
the
subject
matter.
in
any
event,
following
the
dismissal
of
the
brown
case,
we
ask
for
a
hearing
on
the
injunction
suit.
it
was
granted
to
us.
on
the
injunction
case,
she
had
--
the
judge
has
stated
that
the
case
was
moot
and
i
called
to
her
attention
that
it
was
not
moot
because
we
had
that
morning
filed
in
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
which
made
the
case
not
moot
and
in
any
event
she
said,
"well,
for
the
reason
stated,
i
dismiss
this
suit."
then
we
were
brought
in
an
order
to
show
cause
which
was
served
personally
on
each
--
on
each
of
the
parties
here
and
upon
the
attorney
as
to
why
we
shouldn't
be
punish
for
contempt.
we
had
a
postponement
granted.
we
had
a
two
day
hearing.
now,
our
position
was
that
the
order
was
invalid
under
the
original
writ
of
prohibition
was
invalid
because
it
wasn't
processed.
the
rules
quoted
in
my
brief
in
the
appendix
show
that
no
order
or
process
out
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
must
bear
the
signature
of
the
chief
judge.
it
must
bear
the
signature
of
the
clerk
and
the
seal
of
the
court.
and
it
must
be
serve
personally
by
a
--
by
a
sheriff
or
constable.
all
they
did
here,
the
record
will
show,
was
that
the
city
took
an
order
which
had
the
judge's
signature
on
it.
they
duplicated
it,
put
it
in
envelopes
and
mailed
it.
and
that
never
has
the
proof
of
mailing
is
not
even
in
the
record.
at
page
173,
it's
--
we
noted
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
said
it
would
reserve
its
opinion.
they
--
they
did
reserve
their
opinion.
they
never
presented
the
proof
of
mailing
again
so
that
we
were
all
convicted
without
any
service
or
proof
of
service
of
an
order
without
ever
having
an
order
introduced
in
the
evidence.
and
we
contested
the
fact
that
there
had
been
two
orders.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
criminal
contempt
is
what
it
was.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
sentenced,
i
was
sentenced
and
served
20
days.
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
charge
specifically
against
me
was
filing
a
suit,
the
injunction
suit
against
the
two
courts
and
federal
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
was
the
only
charge.
it
was
placed
against
me
for
contempt
that
i
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
i
appealed
the
brown
case
dismissal
and
then
after
i
was
in
jail
--
got
out
of
jail,
i
was
told
that
unless
that
suit
was
dismissed,
i'd
be
put
back
in
again.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
what
they
claim.
and
we
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
they
dismissed
the
appeal.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
had
to
reply
for
or
i'll
stay
in
jail.
and
i
filed
an
application
to
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
we
were
threatened
with
further
imprisonment
and
fines
unless
we
did
do
that
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
we
asked
the
court
to
dismiss
it.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i
tried
to
bring
it
on
certiorari
but
there's
no
way
that
i
can
get
it
here.
the
application
for
certiorari
was
refused
but
i
do
believe
that
we
can
get
relief
under
1651
of
title
28.
in
that,
if
this
court
finds
that
we
were
right
and
that
there
was
a
federal
jurisdiction
invasion
here
and
that
the
orders
which
we
violated
were
void,
then
i
think
to
carry
out
the
judgment
of
this
court,
the
--
this
court
could
exercise
a
supervisory
authority
and
then
instruct
the
district
court
to
reinstate
our
suit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i'm
running
to
a
roadblock
again
on
the
ground
of
res
judicata
because
there
is
an
order
on
record
dismissing
the
original
suit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it's
an
order
on
the
merits,
it
says.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it
might
be
pretty
important.
well,
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
if
the
court
please,
on
this
question
of
the
mere
filing
of
a
suit
stopping
sale
bonds,
counsel
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
the
bonds
that
under
attack
in
the
brown
case
had
already
been
solved.
there
were
no
problem
there.
what
we
were
trying
to
do
is
stop
the
city
from
paying
them
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
election.
in
that
point,
counsel
says
there
is
no
law
in
texas
requiring
an
election.
i
don't
want
to
try
the
brown
case
here.
i
want
to
try
it
in
the
district
court,
that's
where
i
was
trying
to
try
it.
but
for
this
court's
information,
article
46
(d)
(9)
in
part
reads
for
such
purpose
as
your
municipality
may
issue
general
or
special
obligation
bonds,
revenue
bonds,
the
authority
hereby
given
for
the
issuance
of
such
bonds
and
levy
and
collection
of
taxes
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
article
701.
that
article
reads,
"the
bonds
of
the
county
or
an
incorporated
city
shall
never
be
issued
for
any
purpose
unless
the
proposition
for
the
issuance
of
bonds
shall
have
been
first
submitted
for
qualified
voters
where
property
taxpayers
of
such
counties,
city
and
town."
now,
in
the
brown
case,
it's
our
contention
that
this
1269j
is
an
administrative
provision,
in
other
words,
that
specifies
how
the
issuance
is
to
be
made
after
the
authorization
by
the
voters.
but
that
case,
i
hope
some
day
to
try
in
the
court
there,
but
this
contention
that
this
suit
stopped
the
sale
of
bonds
doesn't
even
fit
with
their
own
brief,
on
page
8
of
the
brief.
it's
recited
at
the
top
of
the
page.
this
court,
on
june
25th
1962,
denied
a
writ
of
certiorari.
on
october
8th,
1962,
a
motion
for
rehearing
was
also
denied.
this
is
as
to
the
atkinson
case.
there
was
litigation
pending.
now,
then,
in
the
next
paragraph,
it
says,
"on
september
24th,
1962,
the
day
on
which
bids
for
the
selling
of
airfield
revenue
bonds
were
to
be
open."
in
other
words,
they
were
--
they
say
in
their
old
briefs,
they
were
selling
the
bonds
while
litigation
is
pending.
there
is
no
statute
in
texas
that
says
that
you
can't
sell
bonds
when
litigation
is
pending,
it's
the
same
thing,
it
applies
all
over
the
united
states
that
upon
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
there's
no
prohibition
against
it.
it's
a
matter
that
comes
out
in
a
sale
of
bonds.
all
the
buyers
want
you
to
say
that
there
isn't
any
litigation
pending.
and
there
isn't
any
statute,
it's
submitted
that
there
is
no
statute
or
any
decision
that
says
that
that's
got
to
be
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
so
far
as
i
know,
just
was
applying
this
rule
as
to
--
shows
in
the
record
in
the
civil
appeals
that
the
court
asked
him
about
that.
incidentally,
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
that
judgment
denying
prohibitions,
october
24,
1962,
record
10
and
the
writ
was
issued,
alleged
to
be
issued,
april
16,
1963
at
page
78.
but
in
the
--
in
--
that
question
was
specifically
raised
and
appears
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
this
was
a
statutory
prohibition
against
sale
while
there
was
litigation
pending.
and
counsel
answered
to
the
court
there
that
no
--
finally,
it
was
just
a
matter
they
couldn't
sell
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
it.
that's
what
they're
demonstrating.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
now,
the
bonds
that
i
--
i
didn't
have
any
bonds
in
the
first
suit.
i
was
looking
there
for
an
issue
to
commonwealth,
so
i
couldn't
litigate
anything.
i
had
no
bond
voters.
in
the
second
suit,
i
had
some
seven
outstanding
issues
of
bonds
which
had
been
sold.
and
all
i
asked
for
there
was
an
injunction
against
the
payment.
now,
i
do
have,
i
admit,
certain
pleadings
in
the
second
suit
that
appear
to
be
identical
with
the
first.
but
let's
conceive
that
they
are.
does
that
give
the
state
court
to
right
to
throw
up
the
whole
federal
suit?
just
because
one
possible
issue
was
tried
in
the
atkinson
case
and
decided?our
contention
is
that
none
were
tried.
but
even
though
it
be
true
that
there
was
one
issue
that
had,
can
they
still
tell
us
that
you
can't
have
a
federal
court
decide
these
other
issues?
in
other
words,
they're
saying,
you
give
one
lawsuit
as
a
citizen
when
you
finish
that
against
the
city
of
dallas,
you're
through.
we
--
we
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
runway
is
under
construction,
everything
is
going
along
fine.
money
is
being
spent,
presumably,
the
bonds
have
been
sold.
now,
this
--
the
question
is
still
there.
if
this
whole
thing
could've
been
resolved
on
a
time
base
--
by
having
election,
we
there
have
about
four.
now,
on
the
element
of
time
coming
up
here,
we're
--
we
had
a
motion
available
for
summary
judgment
on
october
6th,
1962.
the
city
didn't
want
to
gamble
on
it.
so
they
tried
this
indirect
route
to
get
us
out
of
the
federal
court.
they
could've
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
before
judge
hughes.
we
could've
argued
it.
we
were
ready.
we
could've
gone
in
the
circuit
court
in
this
area
and
then
up
here.
we
would've
been
here
long
before
dallas.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
but
they
find
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
not
the
original
motion
as
i
read
the
record,
it
was
a
supplemental
motion
which
was
based
on
our
prohibition
from
suit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
was
granted
and
we
were
thrown
out
and
then
our
appeal
was
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i'm
--
i
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
she
discussed
in
--
she
discussed,
mr.
justice
white,
the
matter
at
page
306
and
a
little
prior
in
the
record
to
this
--
for
that
portion
was
quoted
here
i'm
referring
to.
she
had
--
instructed
the
city
attorney
to
argue
his
supplemental
motion.
she
didn't
want
to
hear
the
first
one.
and
the
supplemental
motion
was
the
allegations
as
to
this
writ
of
prohibition.
in
--
after
her
comments
on
--
on
the
case,
i
believe
and
it's
my
interpretation
and
was
at
that
time,
that
her
decision
--
the
meat
of
her
decision
lies
in
the
last
paragraph
in
which
she
said,
"you
and
the
litigants
in
this
case
have
been
prohibited
from
proceeding
in
this
case
and
therefore,
i
dismissed
the
case
as
asked
for
by
the
city
attorney's
office."
now,
i
believe
that's
why
she
dismissed
it.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
true.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
alright.
let
us
go
back
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
is
a
ruling
by
her
but
not
on
anything
presented.
now,
prior
in
the
record,
you
will
find
that
when
they
brought
in
this
extraneous
matter
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
i
asked
the
court
for
permission
to
treat
it
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
of
our
continuance
to
submit
affidavits
and
that
motion
was
denied.
now,
then,
she
didn't
have
except
our
argument
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
originally
filed
but
rather
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
the
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
if
she
had
done
that
and
given
us
our
rights
under
the
rules,
then
i
would
say
--
i
would've
been
out
of
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
could've
appealed,
yes.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
but
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
oh,
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i
either
go
dismiss
it
or
go
back
to
jail
and
20
days
was
enough.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it
would
have
been
under
the
prohibition.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
because
i
would've
been
in
jeopardy.
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
go
forward.
i
did
appeal
but
i
was
--
i
was
threatened
with
jail
if
i
didn't
stop.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
would
have
been
in
exactly
the
same
position.
my
rights
would've
stopped.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
couldn't
get
here
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
the
only
way
i
could.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
i
was
prohibited
by
the
writ
of
prohibition
from
bringing
a
suit
in
federal
court
to
try
and
enjoin
the
state
courts.
careful
reading
of
it
contains
no
such
prohibition
and
those
are
technical
things.
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
along
that
line,
the
counsel
state
that
i
had
the
key
to
my
--
to
the
jail
in
my
pocket.
well,
i
--
i
am
on
disagreement
on
that
point.
and
he
also
stated
that
people
were
allowed
to
purge
themselves
of
contempt.
let
me
read
from
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
at
page
254
of
the
record
and
which
is
the
conclusion
after
the
court
had
adjudicated
everybody
in
contempt,
it
went
on
to
say,
"respondents
be
and
are
hereby
judged
to
be
in
contempt
of
this
court.
but
punishment
of
each
is
a
fine
in
the
amount
of
$200
to
be
paid
by
each
and
everyone
of
them
on
or
before
the
27th
day
of
may,
1963
at
5
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
at
the
clerk
of
this
court.
it
is
the
further
order
judgment
to
the
decree
of
this
court
that
upon
failure
of
the
said
respondents
to
pay
the
fines
and
above
assessed,
within
the
time
here
and
above
specified.
each
of
said
respondents
so
failing
shall
be
imprisoned
in
the
county
jail
of
dallas
county,
texas
without
bail
until
such
time
as
said
respondent
shall
have
purged
himself
or
herself
of
said
contempt
by
payment
of
the
fine
as
here
and
assessed
against
him
or
her
or
until
the
further
orders
of
this
court."
now,
then,
let's
get
go
on
when
to
put
me
in
jail."
it
is
further
ordered
the
judgment
decreed
by
the
court
that
the
respondent,
james
p.
donovan
be
and
he
is
hereby
adjudged
to
be
in
contempt
of
this
court
and
that
his
punishment
be
confinement
in
the
county
jail
of
dallas
county,
texas
without
bail
for
a
period
of
20
consecutive
days
beginning
on
this
date
and
that
he'd
be
remanded
forth
with
to
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
of
dallas
county,
texas
for
the
purpose
of
such
confinement."
now,
there
is
no
opportunity
to
purge
yourself
there.
that's
a
flat
commitment
for
20
days.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
under
the
laws
of
texas,
i
didn't
believe
i
was
entitled
to
one.
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir,
there
is
an
application
filed
by
me
in
the
brown
case
with
the
united
states
district
court,
which
appears
at
314
and
315
of
the
record.
314
is
the
petition
to
dismiss
appeal
where
i
made
reference
to
the
appeal
taken
and
then
i
recited
where
some
of
the
said
appellants
have
been
fined
and
their
attorney
jailed
for
20
days
for
filing
an
injunction
suit
in
the
federal
court
against
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
the
said
court
of
civil
appeals
to
test
the
validity
of
their
orders
restraining
appellants
for
the
prosecution
of
this
suit.
and
whereas
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas
has
wholly
failed
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
these
appellants
and
has
dismissed
this
in
the
affirmance
of
injunction
suit
brought
to
test
the
validity
of
the
state
court
orders.
and
whereas
the
attorney
for
defendant,
city
of
dallas
and
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
have
threatened
these
appellants
and
their
attorney
with
further
prosecution
for
contempt
resulting
in
additional
fines
and
imprisonment,
now,
therefore,
under
the
--
the
rest
above
stated
appellants
name
and
in
those
of
appeal
filed
here
and
on
may
16,
respectfully
request
that
the
said
appeal
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
we
were
going
back
to
jail
if
we
didn't
--
didn't
get
the
appeal
out
of
there.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
but
there
was
only
one
contempt
here,
your
honor,
one
hearing
on
contempts.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
and
that's
after
i'd
serve
my
time
that
this
was
done.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
i
was
sent
to
jail
on
the
22nd.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
but
the
appeal
was
taken
--
was
not
dismissed
while
i
was
in
jail.
this
--
this
appeal
was
written
on
longhand
and
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
but
not
the
--
not
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
dismissed
in
june.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
june
14.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
so
it's
after
i
got
out
of
jail.
it's
after
i've
been
in
jail.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
had
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
i
had
--
i
had
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
--
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
was
filed
after
i
got
out
of
jail.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
after
i
got
out
of
jail.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
i
was
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
got
out
on
the
10th.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
and
the
--
the
petition
was
filed
on
the
11th.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
and
i
didn't
have
the
key
to
the
jail.
they
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
--
should
have
come
to
that
order
as
i
read
it.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
now
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
i
have
--
i
have
filed
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
had
filed
the
motion
of
appeal.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
that's
right.
now,
then,
on
this
question
of
whether
or
not
i
had
been
served
personally
by
the
court
with
this
order
of
prohibition
while
it's
not
particularly,
in
my
opinion,
of
greater
importance
here
because
i
think
it's
a
secondary
question.
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
at
the
record
at
page
201
where
i
had
mr.
bickley,
an
assistant
city
attorney
on
--
on
the
stand
or
on
this
point.
keeping
in
mind
that
we
never
had
a
--
of
--
of
writ
that
i
was
supposed
to
have
violated
or
my
people
were
supposed
to
have
violated
at
anytime
presented
in
evidence
on
this
criminal
trial.
no
writ
was
ever
presented.
but
i
was
questioning
on
this
point
of
whether
i'd
been
served.
as
to
mr.
bickley,
i
said,
"did
you
ever
serve
me
with
the
laws
of
application
to
writ
of
prohibition?"
his
toward
--
bottom
of
page
to
201.
“no,
because
you
admitted
having
been."
answer
-
"i
don't
care
why."
mr.
bickley
given
you
and
chief
justice
dixon's
office
that
morning
when
it
was
handed
to
you
and
said,
no
service
would
be
necessary."
question
-
"and
that's
the
order
you
were
prosecuting
this
contempt
proceeding
on,
is
that
right?"
well,
mr.
bickley
didn't
get
the
chance
to
answer,
mr.
kucera
answered.
he
said,
“yes.”
and
then
mr.
bickley
answered,
he
said,
"no,
he
wasn't
aware
that
was."
and
the
chief
justice
interrupted
saying,
"wait
just
a
minute,
mr.
kucera,
i
heard
you
say
yes
and
answer
the
question.
now,
you're
a
--
not
a
witness,
you
keep
quite."
then
mr.
bickley
answered
again,
"no,
it
is
not
that
order
mr.
donovan.
it's
the
order
that
was
amended
by
the
court
and
then
as
i
understand
it,
given
to
you."
so
i
was
never
personally
served
with
anyone.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
i
think
it
has
to
go
beyond
that.
i
think
that
we've
got
to
order
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas
to
reinstate
the
brown
case.
otherwise,
if
i
file
a
new
suit
involving
a
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i
applied
for
certiorari
but
--
after
conference
with
the
clerk,
i'd
guess
that's
not
within
the
certiorari
rules.
but
this
court,
as
i
understand
the
law,
has
the
power
to
supervise
district
courts.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
the
notices
were
served
on
all
of
the
parties
to
the
proceeding.
of
course,
the
district
court
was
never
a
party
to
the
state
proceedings.
the
only
thing
involved
there
was
my
federal
court
action
because
they
didn't
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i'm
afraid
that
we'll
run
into
a
--
a
plea
there
of
res
judicata
by
reason
of
this
order
of
dismissal.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
of
the
brown
case
by
judge
hughes
upon
them,
the
one
we've
discussed
about
res
judicata
and
the
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
grounds
for
dismissal.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
--
i
would
be
--
i
will
settle
for
that.
i
think
that
if
this
court
makes
it
clear
that
the
state
courts
cannot
interfere
with
the
federal
courts'
jurisdiction
and
that
we
are
entitled
to
try
our
lawsuits,
maybe
we
were
wrong,
i
don't'
know.
but
i
think
under
the
law,
we
are
entitled
to
have
the
benefit
of
a
federal
forum.
if
we
get
that
determined
and
once
satisfied,
then
i
hesitate
--
well,
i
doubt
that
the
state
courts
would
again
try
to
put
us
back
in
jail
or
fine
us
if
we
go
ahead
to
try
and
enforce
our
rights.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
if
--
if
this
court
won't
reverse,
then
i
would
say
that
the
practice
of
laws
become
pretty
hazardous
because
as
it's
stated
in
the
central
bank
case
against
stevens
here,
a
person
is
left
in
this
situation
and
that
was
anticipated
in
that
case
in
1897,
that
where
one
jurisdiction
ends
with
--
interferes
with
another
or
it
attempts
to
decide
cases
for
it
that
the
litigant
is
put
in
the
position
where
either
must
abandon
his
rights
or
run
the
danger
of
punishment
for
contempt.
now,
that
was
the
court's
opinion
there.
they
anticipated
the
problem
and
i
got
into
it.
and
i
got
just
what
the
judges
there
thought
could
happen.
and
i
--
my
argument
now,
i've
been
criticized
here
for
--
for
my
language.
maybe
my
language
does
give
picture
as
of
your
time.
but
this
court
of
civil
appeals
took
the
travel
to
condemn
me
for
describing
the
order
of
the
supreme
court,
as
not
being
worth
the
favor,
it
was
written
on.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
unlawyer-like
conduct.
that's,
in
my
opinion,
a
speech
that
says
what
you're
trying
to
say.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
correct,
about
all
courts.
i
was
also
--
i
was
also
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
--
i
(inaudible)
you
i
was
strong
in
my
speech.
i
made
my
argument
to
the
court,
not
outside
and
i
argued
before
my
people
and
actually
could
the
lawyer
has
not
only
the
right
to
do
that
but
the
duty.
and
i
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
that's
my
effort
to
get
him
before
the
court
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
on
certiorari.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
the
only
point
--
the
only
reason
those
are
in
there,
your
honor,
is
because
i
believe
that
under
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
part
of
it
but
then
i
also
think
that
under
1651,
for
instance
if
you
--
if
you
granted
judgment
reversing
the
state
court
judgments,
then
i
think
under
that
to
make
your
judgment
fully
effective
under
1651,
you
would
have
a
right
to
direct
the
lower
court
--
lower
federal
court
to
reverse
it
here
but
it's
a
long
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
it's
a
long
stretch.
i
admit.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
we
have
the
supreme
court
of
texas
judgment
directing
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
--
to
pray
with
us
we're
going
in
before
our
federal
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
we
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
issuing
the
alleged
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
and
we
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
punishing
all
the
individuals
and
the
attorney
for
contempt.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
so
we
have
those
judgments
before
us.
we
can't
--
i
don't
believe
legally
attack
and
i
may
have
some
remedy
in
the
lower
court
going
back.
i
might
apply
to
the
court
for
reinstatement
of
the
cause
and
possibly
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
they
might
well
do
that.
the
only
hand
we
might
well
hold
and
we
were
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
but
we
would
have
a
decision
from
the
federal
court.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
correct.
now,
this
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
comment
on
and
that
is
whether
this
judgment
of
contempt
is
moot,
it
is
definitely
not
moot.
there
are
$9000
in
fines
in
the
hands
of
the
court
that
were
paid
by
these
people
and
i
think
that
they're
entitled
to
get
it
back.
as
far
as
my
time
in
jail
was
concerned,
i
learned
a
lot
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i
think
automatically,
if
these
judgments
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
which
punished
these
people
for
contempt
are
reversed,
the
fines
will
be
refunded
to
them.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
i'm
asking
--
i'm
asking
him
my
brief
that
the
court
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
fining
and
punishing
these
people
for
contempt
and
directed
that
the
fines
be
remanded.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
not
yet.
i
don't
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
the
state
treasury.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
you
can't
give
you
that.
that's
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
you
have
the
authority
and
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
might
have
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
--
that's
a
question,
your
honor,
respectfully
i
submit
that
there
are
numerous
cases
where
they
say
there's
no
justiciable
interest,
you
haven't
heard
yet.
that's
what
i
was
faced
with.
in
other
word
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
if
that
happens
i
could
come
up
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
--
that's
true,
i
can.
and
then
i'm
faced
with
the
possibility
of
the
court
said,
"you
haven't
been
heard
yet."
therefore
there's
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that
--
that
can
happen.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
well,
what
i
--
what
i'm
stating,
if
this
order
was
void,
as
a
lawyer,
i
was
under
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
no,
that's
the
important
point
because
if
this
was
void,
then
everything
that
was
based
on
that
void
order
is
a
violation
of
due
process
and
the
violation
of
our
constitutional
rights.
if
they
weren't
true,
you
can
make
a
void
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
think
it's
not
only
free
to
do
it,
i
think
it's
a
duty.
i
think
it's
a
decision
every
lawyer
has
to
make.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
judge,
i've
been
practicing
30
years
and
i've
been
up
with
these
cases
and
i've
--
i've
been
told,
"well,
you
shouldn't
be
here
yet.
you
haven't
been
heard.
this
is
just
paper.
how
do
you
know?"
going
out
there
and
try
to
do
these
things
and
then
we've
got
a
justiciable
of
question.
that's
a
decision
that's
got
to
be
made
by
every
lawyer
in
the
united
states
everyday
because
you
--
if
--
besides
that,
this
is
an
expensive
proposition.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
yes,
i
believe
i
could.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
at
that
time
but
i
didn't
have
--
i
didn't
know
that
the
courts
are
going
to
prohibit
me.
i
didn't
know
they're
going
to
throw
us
in
jail.
i
didn't
know
they're
going
to
stop
us
in
federal
court.
we
have
these
opinions
that
it
should
be
done
but
there
was
always
a
possibility
they
wouldn't
do
it.
and
the
writs
up
here
cost
us
$26,130
to
print
a
record.
and
i
went
to
poor
boy
way.
i
went
to
the
district
court
asking
that
court
to
protect
his
jurisdiction
instead
of
coming
up
here
because
we
didn't
have
that
kind
of
money.
and
who
has
struggled
to
get
here
now?
how
far
we
would
be
got
here
and
in
jail?
but
that's
the
position
we
take
on
it
that
we
--
we
are
only
trying
to
bail
on,
we
aren't
making
demonstrations.
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
if
this
is
good
law,
they
can
stop
every
civil
rights
suit
in
the
nation
by
the
simple
procedures
saying,
"well,
there's
a
class
action
been
tried
on
this
back
there
in
1915.
everybody
in
that
class
is
bound.
therefore,
you
can't
go
into
federal
court."
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir,
i've
not
--
up
to
this
point
i
haven't
had
any
complaint
filed
against
me.
i
haven't
been
criticized
by
the
bar
neither
of
--
ever
been
help
by
the
bar,
i
have
been
standing
alone.
and
i
have
had
some
reaction
in
--
in
some
of
the
courts
both
in
texas
not
at
texas
about
being
an
ex-convict
but
i
pray
i
don't
have
any
shame
or
feeling
about
it.
but
so
far
as
the
bar
of
state
of
texas
is
concerned,
no
file
--
no
charges
have
been
filed
against
me.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
there
was
rumor
of
it
while
i
was
in
jail
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
i've
done
anything
on
it
during
my
arguments
it's
been
true
to
court.
in
fact,
they
have
a
letter
from
the
judge
from
the
court
of
civil
appeals
recommended
me
on
my
--
professional
conduct
27
days
before
he
send
me
to
jail
for
20.
and
i
don't
think
reading
the
record,
i
would
grant
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
i
--
i
should
have
given
(inaudible)
i
guess
at
that
point.
but
i
grant
you,
i
will
fight
a
lawyer,
i
fight
for
my
people,
i
believe
in
the
law
and
i'll
always
have
and
i'll
fight
high.
i
don't
think
that
i
did
anything
here
that
was
illegal.
if
my
judgment
was
wrong,
yes.
i
maybe
--
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no,
sir.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
no.
mr.
james
p.
donovan
that's
right.
i'm
a
member
of
the
bar
in
new
york
and
texas
and
also
in
the
federal
bars
of
oklahoma
and
arkansas
and
new
york
and
texas
and
two
circuit
courts
and
i've
been
working
at
that
for
30
years.
but
i
had
no
charges
filed
against
me
but
i
am
proud
of
my
records
and
i'm
very
interested
in
getting
it
clear
because
i
think
that
i
fought
for
a
protection
of
federal
jurisdiction,
which
is
a
rare
thing
in
these
days
and
i
got
punished
for
it.
and
i
think
i
was
right.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
to
what
the
states
cannot
interfere
with
the
federal.
i
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
thing
and
put
us
back
in
status
quo
and
to
establish
once
and
for
all
that
a
lawyer
has
the
right
to
go
to
federal
court
to
find
out
whether
he's
right
or
wrong
without
the
states
interfering.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you
very
much
i'm
here.
