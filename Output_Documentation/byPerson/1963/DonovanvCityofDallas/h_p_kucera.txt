mr.
h.
p.
kucera
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
should
like
to
correct
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
referred
to
and
what
this
meaning
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
with
reference
to
the
atkinson
case
and
then
let's
talk
about
whether
or
not
this
was
a
class
suit
or
a
taxpayer
suit.
counsel
has
stated
over
here
that
the
state
law
of
texas
requires
a
referendum
on
the
matter
of
issues
or
revenue
bonds.
i
defer
with
that
and
the
cases
that
i've
cited
to
you
here
in
our
brief
that
in
the
revenue
bond
cases,
under
the
texas
law
and
even
on
ad
valorem
taxation,
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
whatsoever
that
that
be
a
referendum.
however,
the
legislation
did
provide
that.
about
1899,
that
--
with
reference
to
ad
valorem
tax
bonds,
their
vote
isn't
necessary
by
the
taxpayers.
but
there
is
none
required
on
the
revenue
bonds.
they
--
keeps
on
doctrine
over
here
and
how
that
had
been
denied
the
civil
rights
of
franchise.
well,
this
is
--
since
this
statute
doesn't
provide
for
a
franchise,
there
was
no
civil
right
denied
there.
and
i
think
that
question
is
whole
of
this
side
issue.
now,
then,
the
statement
was
made
over
here
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
atkinson
case
held
that
the
--
that
these
plaintiffs
or
taxpayers
did
not
have
the
right
or
as
residence
to
contest
the
bond
issue
and
that
there
was
no
provision
in
the
law
to
contest
bond
illegally
issued
until
they're
offered
for
payment.
with
that,
i
disagree
and
i
think
those
are
in
the
brief.
i
will
support
to
my
view
on
that.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
sir?
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes.
the
question
is
the
--
if
there
really
showed
you
this
over
here.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
that's
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
on
the
ground
that
the
--
the
matter
had
already
been
litigated,
it
--
they
are
both
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
if
the
state
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
our
position
is
this
that
since
they
submitted
that
question
to
the
state
court
over
here,
this
claim
in
the
state
court
was
the
right
of
franchise,
that
it
was
denied
the
civil
rights.
the
court
has
judged
it
against
him.
now,
he
sought
to
relitigate
it
again.
the
real
basic
issue
over
here
on
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
my
--
my
position
in
this
case
is
this
that
he
has
submitted
that
question
in
the
state
court
and
it
was
adjudicated
against
him
and
this
court
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
he
exercise
is
right,
your
honor,
by
asking
for
a
certiorari
to
have
the
judgment
of
texas
court
reviewed
by
this
court.
and
this
court
denied
here
in
the
relief
on
that
very
same
issue.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
because
of
the
--
the
fact
that
he
has
been
litigated
otherwise
he
--
there
was
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
a
litigation
somewhere
in
those
--
somewhere.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes.
this
is
a
--
this
a
peculiar
case
in
this
sense,
that
the
mere
filing
of
the
lawsuit
over
(inaudible)
the
bond
issued
destroys
the
efficacy
of
the
state
judgment.
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
counsel
has
misstated
though
i
let
go
again
the
proposition
that
we
could
have
sold
those
bonds.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
this
very
case
solely
stated,
that
these
bonds
could
not
be
sold,
that
regardless
how
frivolous
a
lawsuit
may
be
filed
immediately,
the
sale
of
the
bonds
to
which
the
city
expect
to
of
those
related
funds,
it
would
reach
to
build
their
own
way
was
equivalent
to
an
injunction
which
the
court
had
decided
he
was
not
entitled
to.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
he
certainly
again
that
it
would
never
be
in
to
litigation.
take
the
case
of
princess
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
we
think
it
is
allowed
because
it's
almost
four
years
but
still
--
still
arguing
by
the
one
that
has
started
in
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
1861.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
i
am
saying
the
law
with
reference
to
this
case,
they
should
be
applied
from
the
standpoint
of
what
we
were
litigating
over
here.
as
i
stated
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
he
had
litigated
a
question
on
civil
rights.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
princess
lida
against
thompson,
same
situation
happened
there.
there
was
a
suit
filed
in
the
common
pleas
court
in
pennsylvania
litigating
over
a
thrust
of
matter.
when
some
proceeding
--
there
is
a
certain
stage
in
the
state
court.
one
of
the
dissident
fighters
went
to
the
federal
court
and
sought
to
litigate
the
very
same
thing.
the
state
court
of
pennsylvania
issued
a
rule
against
these
fighters
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
enjoined
from
prosecuting
the
case
in
the
federal
court.
the
case
proceeded
on
trial
and
that
it
did
order
them.
they
joined
the
trial
court
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
which
affirmed
the
injunction
against
the
prosecution
of
the
suit
in
the
federal
case
--
federal
court.
and
this
court,
in
the
opinion
by
justice
roberts,
affirmed
that
judgment.
now,
they
have
filed
out
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
issue
was
this
that
these
parties
have
headed
them
in
court,
litigating
their
problem
that
they
have
--
with
the
courts
and
having,
the
first
of
page
--
jurisdiction
--
they
have
the
right
to
proceed
to
or
judgment
is
in
that
case.
there,
the
case
arose
on
the
fifth
district
within
the
last
two
or
three
years
while
the
litigant
was
litigating
in
the
state
courts
in
florida.
he
lost
all
the
way
through,
then
he
went
to
houston.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
--
they
also
say
--
he
has
also
says
in
there
that
the
course
of
having
competent
--
common
jurisdiction,
state
and
federal,
that
one
--
the
court
can
proceed
irrespective
to
the
other
one
until
there
is
a
judgment
rendered
which
can
then
the
final
judgment.
now,
we
had
a
final
judgment
in
our
case.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
your
honor,
again,
the
delay
over
--
of
an
appeal
to
the
u.s.
circuit
court
and
a
writ
over
here
which
it
would
take
another
year.
here
it
held
holding
up
public
improvements.
and
since
the
question
was
unquestionably
decided
and
for
the
fact
that
the
same
question
that
would
have
been
presented
here,
the
validity
of
the
bonds
and
the
right
to
enjoin
the
construction
as
a
damage
under
the
texas
constitution
having
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
before
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
that's
just
the
tragedy
of
the
whole
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
exactly
the
point,
your
honor.
exactly
the
point.
otherwise,
there
is
no
point
if
--
to
litigate
if
it's
going
to
be
litigating
every
time
the
city
wants
to
proceed
to
--
with
an
improvement
of
this
character
because
there
will
always
be
somebody
or
some
visitor
that
would
want
to
file
a
suit.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
your
honor,
that's
the
whole
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
(inaudible)
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
the
--
in
this
very
opinion
which
is
by
a
way
of
review,
that
the
moment,
irregardless
how
frivolous
a
lawsuit
is
filed
that
took
the
bond
issue,
those
bonds
cannot
be
sold,
the
texas
law
provides
and
requires
that
the
attorney
general
of
state
of
texas
must
certify
as
to
the
validity
of
those
bonds
and
he
is
prohibited
from
so
certifying
so
long
as
there
is
any
character
of
litigation
pending
irregardless
how
frivolous
it
maybe.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
perhaps
that's
--
that's
true
but
at
the
same
time,
there
ought
to
be
an
end
of
litigation
respect
over
here.
now
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
exactly.
that
is
the
moment
it
was
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
moment
the
suit
is
filed
is
just
as
effective
of
injunction.
now,
under
the
texas
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
no,
that's
not
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
the
best
--
that's
not
the
question.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
texas
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
the
texas
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
texas
supreme
court
holding
this
to
the
effect
that
a
plea
of
res
judicata
is
in
lots
of
adequate
remedy
to
--
to
deal
with
their
situation
of
this
sort.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
on
--
on
this
--
this
kind
of
situation,
i
think
when
it
comes
to
construing
whether
or
not
the
texas
constitution
guarantees
these
people
compensation
or
whether
they
got
a
right
of
--
pass
a
law
in
texas
in
which
it
can
authorize
the
city
to
issue
bonds
without
a
vote,
i
think
that's
a
local
matter
and
i
think
incidentally
that
very
same
question
i
haven't
got
the
case
over
here
but
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
--
kentucky
within
the
last
six
months
so
held
that
the
question
of
federal
franchises
not
in
those
identical
statute
and
they
cite
the
walters
(ph)
case
and
the
two
or
three
cases
supported
it.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
comity
of
--
between
the
jurisdictions
of
the
federal
estate
has
always
been
recognized
principle
but
when
a
person
submits
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
the
enforcement
of
their
judgement,
he
certainly
is
a
subject
to
the
--
to
the
orders
of
that
court.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
if
it
started
over
there,
yes,
but
he
agreed
he
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
he
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
--
that's
true
but
at
the
same
time
there's
a
regular
remedy
of
appeal
to
--
through
certiorari
to
have
the
actions
of
the
state
court
review
it
over
here.
but
he
has
exhausted
that
remedy
and
after
the
situation
was
over
with,
we
were
still
stymying
because
every
time
we
throw
in
a
lawsuit,
we
--
we
were
stopped.
those
are
the
--
those
are
the
--
that's
the
basic
question.
now,
we're
raising
over
here
the
question
over
here
about
the
irregularity
of
the
writs
in
there
was
not
served
with
the
writ
of
prohibition.
the
writ
would
demonstrates
and
shows
that
the
writ
was
partially
handed
over
to
the
attorney
here
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
court
who
issued
it.
there
is
an
admission
over
there
and
that
the
people
got
it.
there's
a
long
record
of
the
hearing.
you
--
in
here
on
the
contempt
proceedings
that
he
met
with
these
people
as
of
the
name
of
the
places,
that
he
analyzed
the
decisions
and
that
he
told
them
it
is
not
worth
to
play
for
the
writ.
here
was
a
valid
order
of
the
state
court
prohibiting
the
litigation.
somebody
is
on
the
line
and
should
be
avoided
based
just
exactly
like
was
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
in
the
united
mine
workers
case
and
quite
a
few
others.
on
the
question
of
the
irregularity
or
alleged
irregularity
of
the
service
over
here,
i
think
the
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case
by
--
justice
harlan
takes
care
of
that.
there,
the
same
question
was
raised
to
the
effect
of
that
he
was
not
formally
served
with
the
interrogatories
under
which
the
--
the
contempt
proceedings
were
based.
the
court
answered
while
he
was
in
court.
he
heard
him
and
that's
all
you
need
to
know.
i
object
to
the
decision
on
that
same
thing
or
which
we
are
cite
here
take
care
of
that
because
here,
they
appeared,
motion
continues,
they
were
granted
10
days
leave
and
that's
10
days
weren't
asked
to
me.
they
were
individually
called
by
name
in
the
court
and
told
by
the
chief
justice,
"you
can
go
ahead
and
purge
yourself
over
here
by
dismissing
the
suit
or
obey
the
orders
of
the
court
once
you
play
here."
26
of
them
so
took
--
took
that
position.
counsel
had
the
keys
to
the
jail
in
his
pocket
when
he
was
commanded
to
dismiss
the
litigation
over
here
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
texas
supreme
court
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
it's
here
too.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
and
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
it
was
--
it
was
to
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
ordering
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
enforce
the
judgment.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
and
then,
when
the
court
of
civil
appeals
ordered
--
they
issued
a
writ
of
prohibition
directing
these
people
to
cease
from
further
litigating
this
matter
in
to
--
in
the
federal
court,
they
were
--
a
judge
give
before
contempt
of
court
and
that
judgment
to
the
way
for
review.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
no,
sir.
we
had
applied
for
a
review
of
certiorari
to
the
dismissal
of
the
two
cases
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
by
the
federal
district
court
and
the
--
this
was
expressly
their
review
so
that
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
denied,
yes.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
right.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
it's
here
--
it's
here.
now
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
--
yes.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
now,
that's
--
well,
one
other
point,
the
question
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
set
aside
its
formal
judgment
or
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
refusing
to
grant
the
writ
of
prohibition
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
without
notice.
now,
that
is
wholly
besides
the
issue
because
this
--
this
counsel
and
everyone
of
its
partner
were
parties
to
the
--
to
the
writ
of
mandamus
suit
in
the
supreme
court.
they
appeared
over
there
by
counsel,
briefs
and
everything
else
and
they
--
when
the
court
--
there
was
nothing
for
a
court
of
civil
appeals
to
do
except
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
now,
there
are
several
decisions
of
the
texas
supreme
court
which
i
didn't
bother
this
brief
with,
that
there
were
no
time
and
time
again
of
the
--
of
the
inferior
court
judgments
without
--
without
telling
them
to
do
so.
they
just
say,
"you
will
disregard
it
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
then
you
will
proceed
to
enforce
the
judgment
in
this
case."
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
sir.
and
the
jail
terms
were
served.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
right.
and
your
honor,
furthermore,
on
the
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
i
thought
so.
it
maybe
it
is.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
but
what
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
i
don't
know
what
--
what
move
he
might
make
as
far
as
that
goes
but
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
--
they
didn't
raise
the
question
of
mootness
over
here
but
we
did
over
the
idea
--
did
want
to
say
this
that
the
judgment
of
contempt
now
was
framed
that
the
--
be
given
--
this
individual
given
6
days
who
wished
to
comply
in
the
--
they
define
or
protect
its
source.
26
of
them
took
the
option
to
--
to
purge
themselves.
and
donovan
himself
was
put
in
to
jail
subject
to
--
for
the
order
of
the
court
when
he
elected
to
stay
there
and
serve
out
his
time.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
if
the
texas
judgment
means
anything,
he's
--
he
would
be
violating,
yes.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
going
back
once
more
to
this
question
of
--
this
is
not
a
civil
rights
case
it's
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
if
--
and
most
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
court
of
texas
have
held
that
there's
no
question
of
franchise
there.
so
--
and
similar
to
kentucky
federal
courts
so
held,
there
is
only
one
question
over
here,
a
question
of
harassment
to
stop
the
city
from
this
improvement
by
the
filing
of
the
lawsuits.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
point
--
he
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
and
if
he
could've
gotten
in
the
federal
court
about
that,
i'm
not
going
to
pass
on.
but
the
same
question
is
this.
he
again
chose
that
and
when
he
got
through
and
in
light
of
this
issue,
this
starts
--
starts
the
other
one.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
litigation
of
this
kind.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
that's
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
no,
sir,
it
was
against
the
individual
plaintiff
just
exactly
like
it
was
done
in
the
princess
lida-thompson
case
from
--
from
pennsylvania
and
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
if
they
did
is
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
it's
in
line
with
the
arkansas
case
as
it
goes
a
little
further.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
kline
construction
company
case,
that
thing
goes
a
little
further.
it's
not
in
my
brief
at
all.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
i
--
i
think
maybe
i
can
find
it
in
one
of
the
briefs,
your
honors.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
yes,
it's
260
u.s.
226.
in
closing,
i
just
like
to
state
over
here
that
here,
we
have
a
valid
outstanding
order
of
the
courts
which
ought
to
be
obeyed.
there
is
no
denial
of
compensation
to
these
people
before
the
tax.
the
law
protects
those
people.
and
that
under
the
law,
as
we
see
it,
this
has
been
nothing
but
accomplished
indirectly
--
would've
failed
directly.
and
having
elected
to
pursue
that
for
us,
the
judgment
that
were
--
were
handed
down
in
contempt
or
for
it
--
it
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
state
court.
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
but
the
question
is
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
the
state
court
over
--
mr.
h.
p.
kucera
well,
i
thought
there
wasn't
any
particular
supremacy
on
the
matter
of
where
the
jurisdiction
is
coextensive.
the
one
that
acquires
jurisdiction
first,
gather
the
right
to
proceed
the
judgment,
putting
personal
in
a
--
in
a
personal
claim
like
that
one
before
it
does
stay
over
here,
that
somewhere
down
the
line,
one
can
be
a
bar
to
the
other
one
we
--
which
renders
final
judgment
in
it.
our
provision
has
been
right
long
over
here
that
that's
not
the
case
here.
here,
the
--
the
mere
filing
of
the
suit,
although
we're
talking
about
--
there
were
securities
involved
in
the
princess
lida
case,
but
here,
we
got
a
bond
issue
over
here.
so
what's
the
difference
between
a
state
--
citizen
security
and
their
private
security
when
you
go
litigate
it
when
the
mere
filing
of
the
suit
will
destroy
the
ethic
to
seal
of
the
first
judgment,
state
judgment.
