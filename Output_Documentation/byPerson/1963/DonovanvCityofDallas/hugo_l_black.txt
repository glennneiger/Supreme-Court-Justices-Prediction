you're
right

law

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
you're
right
on
the
law
and
that
a
man
had
no
case
in
federal
courts,
is
that
the
issue
before
us
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
the
real
issue
was
whether
texas
courts
could
enjoin
litigants
who
are
rightfully
in
federal
courts
pursuing
their
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
whether
the
lawyers
can
be
put
in
jail
for
not
dismissing
a
suit
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
the
ground
--
on
one
ground
of
which
has
the
premises,
i
would
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
--
can
any
man
who
filed
a
civil
rights
sue
in
texas
that
--
his
civil
rights,
let's
forget
this
case,
that
his
civil
rights,
can
the
state
courts
can
get
him
into
the
court
and
enjoin
him
from
pursuing
his
suit
in
the
federal
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
the
federal
court
passes
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
two
courts
there
involved
and
the
question
of
a
man's
right
to
pursue
a
claim
that
he
had
certainly
has
in
the
federal
court
where
the
federal
court
has
not
dismissed
it.
is
it
--
does
your
case
stand
up
on
this
proposition,
that
the
state
courts
of
texas
have
power
under
the
constitution,
to
call
a
litigant
in
and
he
was
litigated
in
the
federal
--
in
its
federal
court?
so
you
either
dismiss
this
or
go
to
jail
until
you
dismiss
it,
is
that
--
you
--
you're
saying
that
power
for
the
court
of
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
had
been,
suppose
he
went
into
the
federal
court
and
claimed
that
it
was
wrong
for
violating
his
right
or
take
a
man
in
the
civil
rights
where
there's
more
involved
in
it
in
this
simple
bond
issue.
is
the
federal
--
does
your
state
court
has
the
right
to
take
litigants
out
of
the
federal
court
and
power
under
the
constitution
and
put
their
lawyers
in
jail
if
they
do
not
dismiss
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
what
is
it
--
he's
asked
to
release
here
on
the
ground
of
what's
going
on
there,
hadn't
he?
you
--
he
had
to
dismiss
his
case.
they've
made
him
dismiss
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right
because
--
because
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
state
court
says
now
that
it
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
each
are
gone
in
the
federal
court
which
it
can
enforce
by
putting
a
lawyer
in
the
federal
courts
litigant
in
jail
either
him
or
as
--
well,
you
--
it
pursues.
do
you
defend
that
as
the
right
of
texas
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it,
when
a
man
--
when
the
state
court
thinks
a
man
is
barred
by
formal
adjudication,
he
files
a
suit
in
the
federal
courts
that
the
state
court
is
the
one
that
has
the
right
to
determine
that
question
and
he
--
he
doesn't
--
he
has
no
right
in
the
federal
court
at
all
which
the
state
court
paid
enjoined
him
for
--
from
pursuing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
might
be.
the
federal
court
says
it's
not
interminable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
basically,
this
question,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
unless
you
can
show
me
differently,
gets
down
to
this.
can
the
state
court
of
texas
or
any
other
court
call
in
a
litigant
which
tried
to
assert
constitutional
rights
in
the
federal
court,
as
this
case
pending,
can
the
state
court
put
him
in
jail
either
him
or
his
lawyer,
if
he
refuses
to
dismiss
this
case
on
the
federal
court?t
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
--
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it's
raised
not
in
the
question
of
which
you
are
litigating
but
it's
raised
in
question
with
the
power
of
the
court
or
state
court
to
put
a
lawyer
representing
a
party
and
the
federal
court
in
jail
if
he
doesn't
dismiss
this
case
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
are
resting
again
on
that
point
on
what
is
the
main
issue
on
the
thompson.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least.
well,
the
intimation
is
little
stronger,
your
honor,
in
the
--
in
the
kline
case
as
in
(inaudible).
the
--
the
blanchard
case
from
the
fifth
circuit,
their
writ
was
denied.
he
went
to
houston
and
sought
to
litigate
the
very
same
thing.
there
was
a
plea,
a
motion
filed
which
called
attention
of
the
trial
courts
of
two
things.
one,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
had
enjoined
him
from
prosecuting
the
case
in
this
--
the
federal
court
of
houston.
and
second,
the
plea
of
res
judicata.
the
trial
court
sustained
a
plea
of
res
judicata
and
dismissed
the
cause.
on
appeal,
the
judgment
was
modified
to
the
effect
that
the
court
should
not
have
pass
upon
the
plea
of
res
judicata
but
should
have
recognize
the
injunction
issued
by
the
florida
supreme
court
and
dismiss
the
lawsuit
on
that
ground
and
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
in
that
case.
the
court
also
say
to
the
state
that
if
the
opinion
or
the
judgment
in
the
--
of
the
florida
supreme
court
were
not
satisfactory
to
this
party,
that
he
--
his
remedy
was
to
seek
readdress
in
this
court
by
certiorari
appeal
which
of
the
case
maybe
and
not
to
--
to
litigate
elsewhere.
similarly
in
this
case
over
here,
when
the
supreme
court
of
texas
order
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
proceed
with
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
which
it
had
rendered
in
the
atkinson
case
by
one
of
our
--
writs
were
necessary,
it
was
then
moved
to
ask
the
state
--
of
this
court,
well,
they
didn't
do
it.
they
waited
to
89th
day
to
that
--
after
all
the
contempt
proceedings
and
the
final
debate
the
--
the
sentence
was
served.
so
the
point
here
is
--
over
here,
that
you
tried
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court
over
here
to
get
judge
hughes
to
stop
the
supreme
court
of
texas
from
proceeding
with
the
enforcement
of
his
judgment.
now,
somewhere
down
the
line,
we
got
to
have
some
order
over
here
if
--
if
they're
going
to
have
a
rule
of
law
particularly
in
its
sue
in
a
case
of
this
order.
if
a
person
can
ad
--
al
infinitum
proceed
to
throw
a
judgment
--
i
mean
a
lawsuit
against
proposed
bond
issue
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
is
--
cannot
be
sold
while
litigation
is
pending,
then
public
improvement
will
stop
from
then
on.
they
of
course,
have
little
--
said
that
time
and
time
again.
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
case
that
we're
involved
here.
they
were
not
trying
to
protect
their
homes
over
here
as
far
that
goes
in
the
second
suit
because
the
texas
supreme
court
and
under
their
constitution,
guarantees
these
people
over
here,
if
when
--
when
they
suffer
damages
that
they
will
be
paid.
we
cannot
go
to
article
1,
section
17,
confiscate
or
damage
of
property
without
legal
responsibility.
but
they
use
this
device
of
--
the
second
suit.
they've
waited
about
two
hours
to
file
the
second
suit
before
we
readvertise
for
the
--
for
sale
of
the
bonds
and
immediately,
the
bond
issue
was
killed,
so
that
--
that's
the
kind
of
lawsuit
that
we
have
over
here.
one
of
the
questions
that
i
think
bears
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
--
what
you
are
saying
then,
particularly
because
it
wants
to
adopt
a
law,
providing
the
bond
issues
shall
not
be
close
--
can't
be
sold
by
the
litigation
going
on,
has
thereby
taken
away
from
the
federal
courts
their
right
to
try
a
lawsuit
so
legitimate
in
the
trial
therein,
can
they
have
the
issue
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
state
of
texas
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
the
right
to
enjoin
a
federal
court
from
proceedings
brought
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe,
they
might
think
that.
but
the
federal
law
might
think
that's
enough,
in
which
control
the
federal
law
or
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
hasn't
--
why
isn't
the
state
court
of
texas
accomplish
precisely
what
it
would've
accomplished,
if
it
could've
--
it
doesn't
enjoin
the
judge
himself?
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
are
you
claiming
it's
because
it's
done
indirectly?
if
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
out
indirectly,
they
--
they
have
a
right
to
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
doesn't
a
federal
--
doesn't
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
have
a
constitutional
right
at
the
end
of
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'll
have
to
be
started
there.
suppose
you
want
to
act
what
was
done
in
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
number
of
instances
in
which
that
has
had
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
still
standing,
isn't
it,
suppose
he
pursues
that
claim
in
the
federal
court
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
man
would've
filed
a
new
suit
now,
would
he
be
in
violation
of
the
order
of
your
court
that
we
have
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
--
all
i'm
asking
you
is
not
to
argue
the
--
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
is
that
judgment
still,
as
we
have
here
before,
still
standing
so
that
if
he
were
now
to
file
a
new
suit
in
the
federal
court,
he'd
be
--
he
could
be
sent
to
jail
for
contempt
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
princess
lida,
that's
not
what
this
is
on,
i
happen
to
be
here
when
that
was
decided,
i've
just
reread
it.
it
--
i
--
it
practically
has
no
value
on
this.
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
instead
the
truth
in
personam
but
we
did
different
that
this
was
administration
and
the
court
said
that
state
over
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'll
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
can
furnish

furnished
by
this.
justice

the
kline

(inaudible)
between
to
that
--
that's
the
case
where
that
was
held
at
the
federal

that
enjoined
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
same
rule
applies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
court
can
do
that
to
the
federal
courts
in
view
of
the
supremacy
clause.
justice

what
page?
justice

and
that's
the
only
reason
the
