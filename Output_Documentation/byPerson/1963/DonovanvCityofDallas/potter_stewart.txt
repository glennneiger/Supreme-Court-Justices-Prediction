justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kucera,
is
the
contempt
judgment
as
such
before
--
before
us
now?
justice
potter
stewart
the
contempt
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
certiorari
was
granted
to
what
judgment?
can
you
tell
me
just
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
those
two,
any
others?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
been
denied.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kucera,
in
the
contempt
proceedings,
i
understand
that
the
punishments
of
--
has
--
has
all
the
fines
been
paid?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jail
terms
were
served?
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
--
why
isn't
--
is
that
moot
or
not,
that
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
texas
mean
when
it
says
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
just
couldn't
sell
the
bonds.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
happened
to
the
--
the
love
field,
have
they
ever
built
a
runway?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
--
wasn't
there
a
motion
to
--
to
dismiss
in
the
federal
district
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
was
granted,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
so
even
if
judge
hughes
had
done
what
mr.
justice
white
suggest
that
she
might
have
done,
that
is
to
say,
"i
know
you're
under
a
writ
of
prohibition
but
nonetheless,
it's
the
federal
court,
you
have
a
right
to
be
here.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i'm
going
to
decide
on
the
merits
and
i
decide
its
res
judicata
and
therefore,
dismiss
your
complaint,"
then
you
still
would
have
been
in
the
same
suit
so
to
speak
if
--
because
you
would
have
been
prevented
from
taking
your
appeal
and
required
to
dismiss
your
appeal
under
the
threat
and
impact
of
the
contempt
order
by
the
texas
state
courts,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
ask
for
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
the
petition
recites
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
recites
that
you
had
been
jailed
for
20
days.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
with
some,
mr.
kucera,
as
to
--
with
just
--
which
judgments
are
before
us
now?
some
indication
in
your
brief,
perhaps,
i
misread
it,
but
it
gives
the
impression
that
the
federal
court
judgments
are
before
us
in
this
case
but
they're
not,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you've
failed
in
that
and
there
you
denied
certiorari,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
we
denied
certiorari,
didn't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
give
us
a
picture
of
what
happened.
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
--
except
this
case
isn't
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
judgments
are
before
us?
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
for
contempt.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
to
the
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
that
if
we
--
if
this
court
should
decide
that
you
are
right,
we
would
reverse
those
judgments
of
the
state
courts
and
then
it
would
be
clear
that
the
federal
district
court
should
proceed
on
the
merits
of
your
cause
unencumbered
and
uninfluenced
by
any
--
by
any
writ
of
prohibition
or
anything
else
by
the
state
courts
and
then
would
decide
your
cause
on
the
merits.
perhaps
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
would
decide
very
promptly
that
you
were
foreclosed
by
res
judicata.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
might
hold.
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
merits
uninfluenced
by
any
prohibition
or
--
or
overshadowing
by
the
state
courts
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
