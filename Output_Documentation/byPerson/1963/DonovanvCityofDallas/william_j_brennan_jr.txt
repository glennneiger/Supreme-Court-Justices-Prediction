(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
there
is
something
else
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
also
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
isn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
more
than
that
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
whether
or
not
your
supreme
court
was
right
or
not,
if
they
interpreted
the
state
statute
where
it
concluded
by
whatever
interpretation
they
gave
the
statute,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
another
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that's
--
your
supreme
court
has
declared,
we
have
to
take
that
meaning
and
then
go
on
from
there
as
to
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
different
question,
isn't
it?
but
what
the
meaning
of
the
texas
statute
maybe
is
the
province
of
the
--
your
states
supreme
court
declare.
we
can't
give
it
a
different
meaning
from
that
--
which
--
that
court
gave,
can
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
petition
was
also
filed
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
it
before
the
court
of
appeals
after
you
had
served
the
20
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
did
you
file
that
petition
in
314,
dismissed
in
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
donovan,
let
me
see
if
i
get
this,
if
--
if
you
prevail
and
we
set
aside
the
court
of
appeals'
order
of
prohibition,
is
that
all
the
relief
that
you
need?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
have
any
order
of
the
northern
district
of
texas
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
but
you
don't
have
any
order
of
the
district
court's
clerk,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
--
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
--
you
--
you're
asking
that
we
do
something
about
getting
the
fine
sum?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
maybe
but
not
--
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
we
should
direct
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
can't
give
you
20
days
back
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
could
certainly
raise
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
asking,
it
seems
to
me,
raises
united
mine
workers
questions
and
everything
else.
i
--
i
have
some
trouble
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
mine
workers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mine
workers'
judgment
--
injunction
was
found
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
and
yet
the
fine
based
on
violation
of
it
was
sustained
too.
