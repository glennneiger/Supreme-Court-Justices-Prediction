(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
--
the
first
action
is
purportedly
an
applied
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
would
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
represent
all
the
plaintiffs
in
the
second
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
no
parties
in
the
second
suit
of
--
were
there
parties
in
the
second
suit
of
and
bond
holders
or
other
than
--
what
was
the
class
represented
in
the
first
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
were
the
plaintiffs
in
the
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
were
they
also
homeowners
and
things
in
that
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
--
none
of
them
was
--
at
least
one-half
they
were
wearing
was
--
the
fact
was
--
represented
people
that
were
representing
the
first
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
there
was
no
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
suit
other
than
the
--
than
the
identity
of
the
defendants,
would
you
--
would
you
say
that
res
judicata
was
not
to
be
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
talk
about
defendants.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
say
the
only
case
between
the
two
--
since
--
then
--
in
--
in
the
defendants.
would
you
say
that
res
judicata
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
these
federal
questions
are
raised
in
the
first
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
raised
in
the
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
isn't
very
important
to
your
case
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
condition
was
that
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
judgement
that
they
--
that
--
was
that
--
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
stop
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
going
on?
and
--
and
this
is
the
judgment
that
has
been
brought
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
--
this
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
texas
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
to
complain
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
had
been
appealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
--
would
that
--
was
that
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
that
--
to
that
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
do
you
brought
that
here
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
sir,
but
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
from
action
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
criminal
contempt,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
--
were
you
sentenced?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
was
also
in
violation
of
the
writ
of
prohibition.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
dismiss
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
did,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
did
dismiss
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
judgment
has
never
been
brought
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
care
if
you
got
relief
here.
all
you
have
to
--
you
wouldn't
need
to
resurrect
the
old
so
that
you
could
file
a
new
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
got
relief
here,
that's
what
you
mean
very
much
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
--
if
you
were
right
on
(inaudible)
brought
the
suit,
what
would
have
been
wrong
if
presenting
to
judge
hughes
your
plea
of
res
judicata
and
your
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
res
judicata
can
--
base
from
the
state
court
action,
why
wasn't
that
the
proper
way
of
pursuing?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
--
but
you
wouldn't
have
been
to
anymore
delay
than
you
have
been
because
here,
your
--
your
prohibition
action,
prohibition
mandamus
action
was
brought
here
and
it
was
granted
and
here
you
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
face
the
same
thing
that
everybody
else
around
the
country,
does
it,
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
people
want
to
sue
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
--
mr.
kucera,
is
the
--
is
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
entered
upon
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
ordered
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
the
writ
of
prohibition.
the
court
of
appeals
issued
the
writ
of
prohibition.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
that
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
three.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
three.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
case
that
--
that
broke
the
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
rule
on
the
res
--
this
is
a
ruling
on
the
res
judicata,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
judge
hughes
had
said,
"well,
i
know
you've
been
--
you've
been
enjoined
and
you're
not
before
this
case.
but
i'm
going
to
--
i
think
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
proceed
with
this
case.
so
consequently,
i
must
deal
with
the
first
issue
res
judicata,
i
find
that
the
suit
was
res
judicata."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
you
could've
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
appeal
--
and
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
could've
appealed
this
type
of
--
into
that
--
try
to
upset
that
her
ruling
of
res
judicata,
your
appeal
could
--
was
never
perfected.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
it
was
perfected
but
i
mean
you
couldn't
go
forward
because
you
had
to
dismiss
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
judge
hughes
had
ruled
on
res
judicata,
that's
not
the
end
of
the
case,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
it
been
under
prohibition
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
could've
gotten
here
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
from
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
there's
something
in
the
record
here
for
--
to
indicate
how
and
why
you
dismissed
your
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
after
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what'
wrong
--
what's
wrong
with
the
new
suit
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
order
of
dismissal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
this
court
gives
you
relief
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
the
grounds
for
relief
would
pretty
well
illuminate
the
--
that
passible.
well,
in
any
event,
mr.
donovan,
what
--
if
we
set
aside
the
texas
order,
would
lead
you
to
return
to
the
district
court
and
make
such
application
as
necessary
to
reinstate
the
brown
suit,
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
what
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
this
was
(inaudible)
if
we
got
--
setting
aside
the
contempt
judgement
anyway
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
not
--
only
that
if
you
happen
to
have
violated
the
order,
you
still
could
have
come
up
here
feeling
the
same
judgment
you
could
feel
now,
the
mandamus
prohibition
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
can
violate
--
you
don't
need
the
violation
orders.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
outstanding
order
against
you
to
stop
litigating
with
the
federal
court
if
you
seal
that
order
right
up
here
just
like
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
heard
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
suppose
to
be
free
just
to
make
up
your
own
mind
and
that's
the
void
order
in
violation
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
can
bring
--
you
can
appeal,
you
can
bring
the
case
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
this
be
the
basis
of
