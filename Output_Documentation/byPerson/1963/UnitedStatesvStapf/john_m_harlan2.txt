justice

m.
harlan
(inaudible)
as
a
legacy,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
barnett
that
notwithstanding
that
would
be
entitled
to
marital
reduction
has
nothing
more
due
by
way
of
a
deduction
here
because
of
the
--
the
wife,
as
i
understand
his
contention,
the
wife,
by
making
the
election,
still
lost
more
than
she
would've
gained
by
that
legacy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
the
mathematics
of
that.
i've
examined
mr.
barnett's
brief,
i
still
don't
understand
it
and
i'd
like
to
know
whether
you're
in
agreement
with
his
view
that
this
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
washed
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
but
he
says
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
it
would
be
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
would
be
help
for
me,
at
least,
perhaps,
the
other
members
of
the
court
wouldn't
object
that
you
could
make
the
government
or
at
least
to
both
of
you,
you
can
agree
on
it,
make
the
deductions
as
--
because
i
don't
--
i
cannot
yet
understand
why,
from
a
mathematical
standpoint,
granted
that
this
is
subject
to
the
marital
deduction,
it
doesn't
result
in
the
estate
getting
an
additional
deduction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
can't
--
i'd
like
to
hold
the
mathematics,
that's
all.
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
government
or
you
or
somebody
could
give
us
some
mathematics
(inaudible)
need.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
