mr.
w.
m.
sutton
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
think
it
is
a
misnomer
to
characterize
the
will
here
as
a
gift
of
property
upon
a
condition
that
mrs.
stapf
permits
her
property
to
pass
through
the
trustees.
actually,
we
have
two,
two
entirely
separate
and
different
events
or
occurrences.
one
is
a
gift
from
mr.
stapf
or
not
a
gift,
a
bequest
to
her
in
the
will
of
a
portion
of
his
property.
she
is
put
to
the
election
to
take
under
the
will
or
to
take
against
it.
she
exercised
that
election
at
a
later
time
not
of
course
at
the
time
that
the
debt
but
was
exercised
at
a
later
time.
when
she
did
that,
she
unquestionably
made
a
gift
of
a
portion
of
her
property
to
the
trustees
for
the
benefit
of
her
children
or
their
children.
now,
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
under
the
state
law,
the
husband
or
the
wife,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
can
dispose
of
only
his
or
her
one-half
of
the
community
property
by
will.
the
other
half
of
the
community
property
is
vested
absolutely
in
the
surviving
spouse,
the
absolute
title.
so,
in
a
normal
situation,
a
husband
or
wife
will
dispose
of
only
their
one-half
of
the
property
by
will.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
but
it
is
a
recognized
principle
that
by
the
marital
deduction,
a
husband
or
wife,
either
as
far
as
that
goes,
can
dispose
of
both
halves
of
the
community
with
the
consent
of
the
surviving
spouse.
the
surviving
spouse
is
then
put
to
an
election
whether
to
take
under
the
will
or
to
take
against
the
will.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
if
she
takes
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
correct,
sir.
she
would
have
a
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
that
is
right.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
that
is
her,
that's
fully
vested
interest.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
so,
now
when
she
elected
under
--
to
take
under
the
will,
she
made
a
gift
of
her
property
or
of
her
fully
vested
portion
of
the
community
property
to
trustees
for
the
benefit
of
their
children.
there
is
no
question
about
what
that
is
a
gift
and
that
there's
gift
tax
consequences
attached
to
it,
and
mrs.
stapf
has
never
questioned
or
denied
that.
now,
further,
the
point
of
texas
law
or
community
property
law,
in
instances
where
a
widow
elects
to
take
under
the
will
and
a
portion
of
the
community
property
passes
to
her,
in
this
instance,
a
one-third
of
the
gross
estate
passed
to
her.
now,
that
was
the
property
as
far
as
community
property
was
concerned,
didn't
pass
to
her
under
the
will
but
was
satisfied
out
of
her
one-half
of
the
community
property.
if
i
make
myself
clear,
she
had
a
one-half
interest
in
the
community
property
initially.
under
the
will,
she
was
given
one-third
interest
in
the
gross
estate
which
would
include
a
one-third
interest
in
the
community
property.
now,
under
texas
law,
under
decisions
that
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
there
is
no
argument
with
the
government
counsel
about
the
texas
law
upon
that
point.
the
one-third
part
of
the
community
property
that
she
finally
ended
up
with
didn't
pass
to
her
under
mr.
stapf's
will
but
was
satisfied
out
of
her
one-half
and
so
a
consequence,
she
gave
a
difference.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
as
i
was
pointing
out
yesterday,
we
have
involved
here
two
touchable
transactions,
i
say,
involved
here.
we
only
have
one
involved
and
that
is
the
estate
tax
on
the
estate
of
lowell
stapf.
the
other
taxable
event
or
transaction
that
will
give
rise
to
taxes
would
be
the
gift
by
mrs.
stapf
to
the
trustees
of
a
portion
of
--
for
community
property
as
a
result
of
her
election.
that
would
be
subject
to
such
gift
taxes
as
--
or
imposed
by
the
gift
tax
statute.
so
--
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
here
concerned
with,
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
and
it's
not
an
issue.
we
have
only
the
issue
of
the
estate
taxes
in
the
estate
of
lowell
stapf.
now,
of
course,
prior
to
1942
and
since
1948,
the
community
property
states,
only
the
one-half
share
of
the
community
property
of
a
decedent
is
included
in
his
estate
for
estate
tax
purposes,
that
is
the
--
the
share
and
part
of
the
community
property
of
the
decedent.
of
course,
during
the
period
from
1942
to
1948,
the
entire
community
property,
both
halves,
was
subject
to
a
federal
--
estate
tax.
now,
in
1948,
the
marital
deduction
provision
was
adopted
to
the
remedy
and
the
situation
that
existed
and
put
all
estates
on
a
parity.
in
that,
there
would
be
only
one-half
of
the
property
tax
either
in
a
community
property
state
or
in
a
non-community
property
state
to
the
extent
that
the
property
passed
from
the
deceased
spouse
to
the
surviving
spouse.
now
--
and
that
was
put
in
by
putting
in
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
it
is
deductible,
yes.
in
determining
the
estate
tax,
it
is
deducted
just
like
administration
expenses
or
funeral
expenses
or
debts
and
claims.
it
is
deducted
to
the
extent
of
one-half
of
the
adjusted
gross
estate.
now,
the
adjusted
gross
estate,
to
determine
that,
you
take
the
total
estate
both
halves
in
the
community,
deduct
from
it
all
community
property,
makes
other
adjustments
for
administration
expenses.
and
the
substance
of
--
roughly,
what
you
come
out
with,
the
adjusted
gross
estate
is
that
--
is
--
in
a
community
property
state,
only
the
property
that
is
a
separate
property
of
the
spouse.
now,
in
a
non-community
property
state,
you
do
not
have
that
--
you
do
not
have
that
limitation.
it's
amounts
to
the
same
thing
because
it's
one-half
of
the
gross
estate,
adjusted
gross
estate
that
is
the
limit
of
the
deduction.
now,
that
was
adopted.
the
marital
deduction
was
passed
in
1948
to
equalize
the
community
property
states
and
the
non-community
property
states
by
allowing
this
deduction
of
one-half.
the
--
what
we're
concerned
here
with
today
is
the
value
of
the
property
that
passed
from
mr.
stapf
to
mrs.
stapf.
for
a
property
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction,
there
are
several
things
that
must
occur.
first,
the
property
--
the
--
or
value
which
is
to
be
deducted
and
qualified
for
the
marital
deduction,
it
must
be
included
in
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
that's
the
first
requirement.
the
second
requirement
is
that
the
property
must
pass
from
the
decedent
to
his
surviving
spouse.
of
course,
there
are
other
limitations
such
as
the
terminable
requirement
but
we're
not
concerned
with
that
because
the
property
that
passed
to
mrs.
stapf,
passed
to
her
absolutely
--
excuse
me.
in
mr.
stapf's
estate,
he
owned
real
property
in
the
city
of
amarillo,
value
that
$65,000.
he
also
owns
some
hand
properties
described
in
the
will,
his
hand
tools,
value
at
$100.
he
owned
one-half
interest
in
community
property
of
a
total
value
of
$258,000
that
is,
both
halves
of
the
community.
now,
the
hand
tools
passed
out
of
the
picture
because
they
were
--
it
was
subject
of
a
special
request.
then
he
left
to
mrs.
stapf
one-third
of
the
gross
estate,
both
separate
property
and
community
property
and
put
her
to
an
election
to
take
under
the
will
or
not
to
take
under
the
will.
so,
one-third
interest
in
this
real
property
valued
at
$65,000
passed
to
mrs.
stapf
under
the
will,
that's
the
separate
property.
additionally,
she
took
or
retained
a
one-third
interest
in
the
total
community
estate,
both
halves.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
the
separate
property
being
included
in
mr.
stapf's
estate
and
being
subject
to
estate
taxes.
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
one-third
interest
in
this
separate
property
passed
to
mrs.
stapf.
it
passed
to
her
absolutely,
so
you'll
have
the
first
two
requirements
under
the
gift
tax
--
under
the
marital
deduction
statute.
then
you
come
to
a
question
of
determining
how
much
is
to
be
deducted
in
determining
the
estate
that
is
subject
to
estate
taxes.
now,
we
submit
that
the
full
$22,000
or
one-third
of
the
$65,000
is
deductible
under
the
statute.
it's
by
virtue
of
a
regulation
of
the
commissioner
that
it
is
claimed
that
the
property
so
passing
to
mrs.
stapf
cannot
be
valued
at
its
full
value
for
the
purpose
of
the
deduction.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no,
sir.
we
take
the
position
of
the
regulation
is
invalid.
it
is
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes,
it
--
it's
designed
and
directed
at
the
--
at
this.
the
--
of
course,
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
the
regulation
to
be
invalid
and
an
extension
beyond
the
statute.
now,
turning
--
turning
to
the
--
the
statute
itself,
812
(e)
(1)
(e)
(ii)
is
the
part
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
the
valuation
of
the
property
that
passes
here.
it
says,
"where
--
where
an
interest
or
a
property
is
incumbered
or
any
manner
--
in
any
manner
or
whether
the
surviving
spouse
incurs
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
decedent
with
the
respect
to
the
passing
of
such
interest,
such
incumbrance
or
obligation
shall
be
taken
into
the
account
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
amount
of
a
gift
to
such
spouse
of
such
interest
were
being
determined."
now,
we
have
here
a
question
of
determining
the
amount
that
is
passing.
mr.
barnett
puts
emphasis
on
the
words
to
such
spouse.
but
that
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
section
of
the
statute.
it
is
the
amount
that
presses.
now,
the
regulation
has
a
specific
provision
in
it
that
deals
with
a
community
property
estate
that
is
section
--
regulation
81.47c.
after
referring
to
an
interest
that
is
subject
to
a
mortgage
or
other
incumbrance,
they
say
the
passing
of
a
property
interest
subject
to
the
imposition
of
an
obligation
by
the
decedent
does
not
include
a
bequest,
devise,
or
transfer
in
lieu
of
bower,
curtesy,
or
other
statutory
estate
created
in
lieu
of
dower
or
curtesy
or
other
marital
rights
in
the
decedent
property
or
estate.
then,
specifically
directed
out
of
community
property
state,
the
regulation
says,
"the
passing
of
a
property
interest
subject
to
the
imposition
of
an
obligation
by
the
decedent
does
not
include
a
bequest
in
lieu
of
the
interest
of
his
surviving
spouse
under
the
community
property
laws
unless
such
interest
was
immediately
deprived
of
the
decedent's
death
a
mere
expectancy.
now,
that
is
--
that
regulation
is
directed
particularly
toward
community
property
states.
under
its
language,
it
would
apply,
as
far
as
the
language
is
concern,
only
in
a
community
property
state.
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked
yesterday
as
to
whether
or
not
this
problem
could
rise
in
a
non-community
property
state,
i'll
say
that
it
cannot
arise
except
where
the
surviving
spouse
has
property
of
her
own
over
which
she
has
control
except
for
the
property
of
her
own
and
can
dispose
of
it
by
will
gift
for
the
other
one.
as
in
other
words,
that's
--
it
would
be
something
that
would
occur
in
other
states
but
only
where
the
wife
has
property
of
her
own
is
subject
to
her
control.
now,
the
question
here
is
the
amount
of
the
property
that
passes
and
it
is
to
be
determined
as
if
a
gift
was
being
made
--
being
valued
for
gift
purposes.
now,
the
commissioner
takes
the
position
that
what
mrs.
stapf
gave
to
her
children
should
be
offset
against
what
she
received
in
determining
the
benefit
from
her.
now,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
in
the
first
place,
if
that
is
allowed
to
zero
out
the
value
of
the
property
that
passed
under
the
estate
tax,
you're
going
to
be
subjecting
that
property
to
two
estate
taxes,
one,
when
mr.
stapf
died
and
the
other,
when
mrs.
stapf
dies.
that
is
contrary
to
the
expressed
purpose
and
intent
of
the
adoption
of
the
marital
deduction
provision.
so,
if
--
if
the
government's
position
is
maintained,
you'll
be
taxing
this
property,
this
separate
property
of
mr.
stapf.
you'll
be
taxing
it
for
estate
tax
purposes
twice.
once
in
mr.
stapf's
estate
and
again,
when
mrs.
stapf
dies.
there
is
one
other
fault
and
trouble
with
that.
actually,
what
she
would
be
--
what
the
government
is
saying
should
be
done
is
that
a
tax
should
be
levied
upon
what
mrs.
stapf
gives
to
her
children.
now,
if
that
is
subject
to
any
tax
at
all,
and
we
don't
deny
that
it
is
that
it's
a
gift
and
it's
subject
to
such
gift
taxes
as
are
applicable
to
it.
alright.
if
it
is
a
taxable
gift,
it
is
taxable
at
gift
tax
rates.
yet,
if
you
take
that
value
and
put
it
over
in
the
estate,
you're
going
to
be
taxing
that
gift,
not
at
gift
tax
rates
but
at
estate
tax
rates
and
subjecting
it
not
to
a
gift
tax
but
subjecting
it
to
estate
tax
in
mr.
stapf's
estate.
contrary,
we
submit
to
the
clear
intent
purpose
and
language
of
the
marital
deduction
provision.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no,
well,
it's
substantially
less
so
it
would
be
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes.
in
the
lower
brackets
i
believe
it's
more
than
--
i
mean
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
more
difference
in
the
lower
brackets
but
in
the
higher
brackets
it
is
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
that's
right.
now,
the
--
the
statute
says
that
you're
going
to
tax
this
and
determine
the
value
as
if
in
the
same
manner,
as
if
the
amount
of
a
gift
to
such
federal
of
--
of
an
interest
was
being
(inaudible).
now,
when
you
go
to
the
value
of
the
property
for
gift
tax
passing
from
a
donor
to
a
donee,
you
tax
that
at
its
market
value.
it's
full
value.
now,
of
course,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
gift
tax
statute
that
authorizes
if
it's
purchased
for
a
bona
fide
consideration,
it's
taxed
only
to
the
extent
of
the
above
the
amount
for
which
it
has
given.
now,
this
court
decided
some
years
ago
in
the
wemyss
case,
i
take
it
that's
the
way
you
pronounce
it,
w-e-m-y-s-s,
that
a
--
in
valuing
a
gift
from
a
donor
to
another
person,
that
only
a
consideration
moving
back
to
the
donor
and
measured
in
money
or
money's
worth,
was
to
be
deducted.
in
that
instance,
in
that
instance,
the
donor
gave
to
his
intended
bride
certain
stocks
in
consideration
of
her
agreement
to
marry.
as
a
result
of
her
marriage,
she
gave
up
a
beneficial
interest
in
a
trust
that
had
been
created
for
her
by
her
former
husband.
so,
when
they
got
ready
to
determine
the
value
of
the
gift
from
the
husband
to
his
intended
bride,
it
was
the
taxpayer's
contention
that
what
she
gave
up
should
be
offset
against
what
she
received
to
determine
the
value
of
the
gift.
but
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
the
situation.
that
it
had
to
be
a
consideration
passing
to
the
donor
and
measured
in
money
or
money's
worth.
and
therefore,
the
value
of
the
stock
that
passed
from
the
donor
to
his
intended
bride
was
to
be
valued
at
its
full
market
value.
now,
the
court
held
that
the
mere
deposition
to
the
donee
didn't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
gift
statute.
now,
that
is
the
statute
obviously
that
congress
is
referring
to
in
the
adoption
of
the
marital
deduction
provision
and
the
provision
where
it
says
that
it
shall
be
determined
as
if
a
gift
was
and
if
an
amount
of
the
gift
was
being
determined.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
the
trial
court
and
that
was
the
basis
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
this
case
relying
upon
the
wemyss
case.
now,
we
have
that
kind
of
situation
here
because
when
mrs.
stapf
elected
to
take
under
the
will
and
therefore,
surrendered
a
part
of
her
property
to
the
trustees
for
the
benefit
of
her
children,
there
was
nothing
that
passed
from
her
back
to
the
donor
or
--
or
the
testator
in
this
case,
mr.
stapf.
it
was
a
benefit
that
passed
from
her
to
a
third
party
and
not
a
consideration
that
moved
from
her
back
to
the
donor.
so,
the
wemyss
case
would
certainly
require
the
valuation
of
the
interest
that
passed
from
mr.
stapf
to
mrs.
stapf
under
the
will
at
its
full
market
value.
that's
the
only
question
we
have
is
how
to
value
this
property
of
the
passed.
there's
no
question
about
what
it
passed
and
qualifies
in
every
other
respect
for
the
marital
deduction.
now,
when
mrs.
stapf
elected
to
take
under
the
will,
her
half
of
the
community
property
did
not
go
back
to
or
become
a
part
of
the
estate
of
mr.
stapf
or
subject
to
estate
taxes
in
his
estate
for
gift
tax
purposes.
there
is
a
gcm
ruling
on
that
that
has
been
in
effect
for
many
years
that
where
a
widow
is
put
to
an
election,
her
property,
her
half
of
the
community
does
not
become
a
part
of
the
community
of
the
decedent
for
estate
tax
purposes.
so,
that
property
passed
to
--
passed
to
third
parties
and
it's
not
included
into
the
estate
--
estate
tax
purposes.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
election
was
an
obligation,
i
mean
the
provision
in
the
will
requiring
mrs.
stapf
to
exercise
an
election,
was
an
obligation
imposed
upon
by
the
decedent
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
this
interest
under
the
statute.
we
submit
that
the
word
"obligation",
as
there
used,
refers
to
an
obligation
in
the
nature
of
a
--
in
the
incumbrance
or
a
charge
upon
the
specific
property
that
passes
under
the
will.
we
think
that
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
explaining
this
provision
makes
that
clear
that
it
is
an
obligation
or
a
charge
that
is
on
the
property
itself.
and
since
this
is
not
a
charge
upon
this
particular
property,
it
is
not
an
obligation
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
the
senate
report
upon
--
upon
that
point
makes
it
clear.
and
the
trial
court
concurred
with
us
in
that
view.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
question
on
whether
or
not
the
obligation
was
in
--
in
the
nature
of
a
charge
upon
the
specific
property,
because
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
under
the
direction
in
the
statute
that
the
amount
of
the
gift
be
determined
as
if
a
--
i
mean
amount
of
the
property
passing,
qualifying
for
the
marital
deduction,
would
be
determined
as
if
a
gift
were
being
made.
and
that
therefore,
they
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
reach
and
decide
the
question
of
the
obligation
because
they
thought
the
question
was
concluded
and
decided
by
the
wemyss
case.
the
wemyss
case
has
been
followed
and
report
that
we're
contending
for
here,
is
illustrated
in
some
tax
court
decisions.
the
bartman
case,
it
has
a
situation
parallel
to
what
we
have
involved.
now,
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
in
the
brief,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
puts
emphasis
upon
what
he
says
would
be
a
loss
of
revenue
if
the
opinion
of
the
court's
--
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
followed.
the
circuit
court
recognized
that
under
the
decision
in
segal
versus
commissioner
by
one
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
in
valuing
the
gift
for
gift
tax
purposes
that
passed
from
mrs.
stapf
to
the
children
that
she
was
entitled
to
deduct
the
amount
that
she
gave
up
being
her
one-sixth
part
of
the
community
estate
or
the
difference
between
one-third
and
one-half
which
she
would've
had,
had
she
elected
to
take
against
the
will.
if
that
be
true
and
the
segal
case
had
been
followed
in
a
number
of
several
other
cases
by
the
tax
court,
even
if
that
be
true,
that
is
no
reason
for
imposing
an
estate
tax
where
the
statute
does
not
impose
estate
tax.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
as
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no,
i
--
you
got
two
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
i
don't
think
that's
part
of
the
estate.
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no,
sir.
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no,
there
won't
be
both
taxes,
there
will
be
--
there
will
be
an
estate
tax
on
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
mr.
stapf's
estate
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
which
is
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
it
will
be
deducted
under
the
marital
deduction
and
there
will
be
no
estate
tax
paid
in
his
estate.
but
when
she
does,
that
property
will
still
be
in
her
estate,
assuming
she
had
disposed
of
it
and
it
will
be
subject
to
estate
tax
at
that
time.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
of
course,
of
course.
i
think
the
--
that
assumption
is
made
in
the
marital
deduction
and
the
whole
theory
of
it
is
to
put
it
in
two
piles
and
tax
half
of
it
in
the
first
estate.
and
then
if
anything
is
left,
tax
it
in
the
--
in
the
second
estate.
no,
i
--
i
--
that
is
just
an
assumption,
of
course,
if
you
--
for
me,
necessary
to
there,
of
course.
but
it
will
be
subject
to
a
one
--
it
will
be
subject
to
one
estate
tax,
that
property
and
not
two
which
would
be
the
situation
if
the
government's
position
is
sustained.
now,
whatever
--
whatever
are
the
tax
consequences
for
gift
taxes
and
how
much
gift
taxes
mrs.
stapf
owes
on
her
gift
is,
as
i
say,
another
matter,
it's
not
here
involved.
we
have
here
the
valuation
of
the
property
passing
from
mr.
stapf's
estate.
it
qualifies
in
every
way
for
the
marital
deduction.
in
that,
it
is
a
part
of
his
estate
and
it
passed
from
him
to
her
the
value
--
to
be
valued
as
if
a
gift
were
being
made
and
it's
not
the
benefit
to
the
donee
but
it
is
the
amount
of
the
gift
that
passes.
the
wemyss
case,
we
think,
requires
that
this
property
valued
--
be
valued
at
its
full
value.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
the
deductibility
of
the
debts
and
expenses
of
administration,
the
estate
tax
statute
allows
as
deductions
funeral
expenses,
administration
expenses
and
claims
against
the
estate
as
or
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
jurisdiction
under
which
the
estate
is
being
administered.
now,
under
such
a
statute,
you
are
not
going
to
get
uniformity
in
deductions
because
the
deductions
are
determined
by
the
state
laws.
so
you're
going
to
have
a
--
a
divergence.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
instances
in
community
property
states
where
funeral
expenses
are
--
or
administration
expenses
are
allowed
in
the
--
in
--
entirely
in
some
states
and
in
others,
only
one-half.
so,
you
don't
get
uniformity
and
it's
not
to
be
expected
in
deductions
in
the
federal
--
estate
tax
because
of
the
difference
of
the
different
state
law.
now,
in
texas,
in
the
absence
of
a
will
provision,
only
one-half
of
the
administration
expenses
in
a
community
property
--
in
a
community
estate
are
deducted
in
the,
as
i
say,
in
the
absence
of
a
will
provision.
now,
will
provisions
whereby
a
decedent
assumes
all
of
the
expenses,
all
of
the
funeral
charges
are
valid
and
have
been
recognized
as
making
those
expenses
deductible
or
claims,
deductible
in
their
entirety
where
the
will
so
provides.
that's
been
holding
at
least
in
the
couple
of
tax
court
cases
and
those
are
the
only
cases
that
have
been
able
to
find
on
it
is
two
tax
court
cases
holding,
except
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
it's
for
the
ninth
circuit,
lang
versus
commissioner
recognizes
the
right,
although
they
didn't
there
apply
it
because
the
--
that's
--
didn't
qualified
under
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
a
will
provision
can
change
the
debts
and
administration
expenses
from
being
charged
partly
to
the
--
to
the
survivor
and
partly
to
the
decedent
and
can
be
assumed
by
the
decedent
in
his
will.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
we
say
that
he
is
--
it
--
it
is
certainly
a
legacy.
it
is
certainly
a
legacy
to
her,
it
is
a
bequest
to
her
but
it
is
a
provision
that
is
authorized
by
the
--
by
texas,
recognized
as
a
right
in
texas.
and
therefore,
it
is
a
deductible
expense
that
is
chargeable
against
the
estate
in
texas
and
the
statute
says,
"such
debts
and
claims
and
expenses
as
are
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
jurisdiction.
federal
statute
says
that
it'll
be
in
accordance
to
that.
the
laws
of
the
jurisdiction
in
texas
allow
that
deduction
where
there
is
will
provision,
we
say
we
fit
within
the
statute.
it
is.
yes,
sir,
it
is
a
--
additional
bequest
or
benefit
to
her
and
as
a
legacy
would
certainly
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
to
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
qualify
just
that
way.
it
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
you
say
i
will
pay
it
--
i
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
correct.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
correct.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
washout
in
--
when
he
assumes
the
indebtedness
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
maybe
equalizing
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
in
the
overall
--
in
the
overall
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
if
you
wish
to
qualify
it
in
that
manner,
it
could
be
in
a
sense
--
that's
true.
it
is
true
that
she
would've
had
$16,000
less
had
--
had
she
--
had
there
not
been
any
provision
in
the
will
(inaudible).
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
of
course,
whatever
went
to
the
children
was
more
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
than
would
have
gone
to
the
children
had
he
disposed
of
only
his
one-half
interest.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
so
it's
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
he
--
by
--
undertakes
his
law,
he
can
dispose
of
his
separate
property
by
his
will
and
he
could
dispose
of
his
one-half
interest,
unless
his
wife
elects
to
permit
him
to
dispose
of
the
entire
community
which
this
will
did.
and
in
any
sense,
in
any
sense
that
is
--
what
you
asked
is
certainly
true.
whatever
the
children
got,
they
got
$16,000
more
than
--
had
she
elected
to
take
against
the
will
and
kept
her
own
money
and
dispose
of
it
as
she
wanted
to
at
a
later
term.
that
is
correct.
the
children
got
--
got
more
by
her
election.
certainly,
she
ended
up,
she
ended
up
here
with
less.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes,
he
has
the
right
of
contribution.
there
is
no
personal
liability
upon
the
wife
and
the
husband
and
his
estate
is
personally
liable
for
the
debts
and
obligations
and
suit
maybe
maintained
against
him
and
not
against
the
--
the
widow
for
--
in
satisfaction
of
the
debts.
now
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes,
his
--
his
estate
is
charged
with
all
community
debts
but
he
has
a
right
to
reimburse
it
against
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
his
wife,
yes.
he
has
--
he
has
a
right
of
reimbursement.
third
parties
have
no
claim
against
her
but
he
has
--
his
statement
has
a
right
of
reimbursement,
correct.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
how
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
i
will
agree
with
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
i
will
agree
with
mr.
barnett
on
that
if
these
debts
are
not
entitled
to
be
deducted
as
debts
and
claims.
and
they
are
in
--
to
be
considered
only
as
a
pecuniary
bequest.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
i
agree
that
that
qualifies
for
the
marital
deduction.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
now,
he
goes
--
that's
--
that's
far
as
i
agree
with.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
he
says,
from
that
point
on,
that
there
is
no
marital
deduction
because
you
ought
to
zero
out
the
value
of
this
property
because
she
gave
other
property
and
she
ended
up
with
a
net
benefit
of
less
than
what
she
received.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
now,
of
course,
the
mathematics
wouldn't
quite
work
out
--
wouldn't
quite
work
out.
i
--
i
don't
believe
because
she
would
actually
benefit
by
$16,000,
an
additional
benefit
and
what
she
--
of
course,
mr.
barnett,
gave
up
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
is
the
difference
between
a
one-sixth
and
a
--
and
a
--
i
mean,
a
one-third
and
a
one-half
of
her
community
property.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
so
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
i
certainly
agree
with
that
and
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
alright.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
would
it
be
permissible
for
us
to
write
you
on
that?
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
to
explain
the
mathematics
and
for
--
instead
trying
to
go
through
with
that
at
this
point.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
now,
the
point
here
is
upon
the
--
the
marital
--
on
these
debts
and
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hope
that
all
debts
should
be
deducted
from
estate
by
a
virtue
of
the
provision
in
the
will,
i
mean,
it
should
be
deducted
in
the
determining
estate
taxes
by
a
virtue
of
provision
in
the
will,
for
the
reason
that
the
statute,
authorizing
these
deductions,
says,
with
respect
to
claim,
that
it
maybe
deducted
only
with
respect
to
the
--
the
--
where
there
is
a
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth.
now,
the
debts
and
claims
in
this
instance
are
in
the
main
if
not
totally
debts
that
arose
by
operation
of
law.
now,
a
claim
to
be
deducted
has
to
be
a
claim
that
is
based
upon
a
--
and
based
upon
a
promise,
can
be
deducted
only
to
the
extent
that
the
consideration
was
received
in
adequate
consideration.
therefore,
where
you
have
a
community
debt,
you
would
only
deduct
one-half
of
it
under
this
statute
even
under
our
position
as
--
and
under
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
a
community
debt
is
chargeable
to
equal
--
to
each
half
of
the
community
and
so
you
would
only
include
one-half
of
the
community
property
or
interest
in
that
estate
of
the
decedent
that
first
died
and
so
you
would
only
deduct
and
charge
--
i
mean,
you
would
deduct
only
one-half
of
the
--
of
the
debts
that
are
founded
upon
a
promise
and
consideration.
the
--
that
fact
alone
will
prevent
there
being
the
opportunity
for
a
person
as
to
--
to
manipulate
the
debts
and
liabilities
to
where
it
would
zero
out
property
or
as
far
as
estate
tax
purpose
is
concerned.
that
was
a
matter
of
concern
to
judge
wisdom
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
illustrates
--
it
was
used
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
but
when
you
read
the
circuit
court's
opinion
in
light
of
the
consideration
required,
the
situation
or
illustration
given
where
a
person
owned
a
million
dollars
and
went
out
and
bargain
another
million
dollars
and
then
took
the
$200,000
or
two
million
dollars
and
bought
two
million
dollars
worth
of
stock
and
then
the
husband
assumed
all
of
the
indebtedness
and
this
property
supposed
to
--
to
pass
tax
free,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
work
out
that
way,
the
mathematics
doesn't
work
out
that
way
because
only
one-half
of
that
debt
would
be
deductible
in
the
husband's
estate,
so
you
would
have
--
you
have
half
a
million
dollars
--
they
originally
had
a
million
dollars
from
"inde"
and
they
bought
another
million
dollar
worth
of
stock,
wait
a
minute,
they
had
bought
two
million
dollars
worth
of
stock,
so
there'd
be
a
million
dollars
under
this
example
that
would
subject
to
tax
in
the
estate
and
you
would
have
a
deduction
of
only
half
of
the
indebtedness
or
$500,000
and
so,
there
is
not
the
chance
of
tax
avoidance
that
is
feared
in
the
deduction
of
the
statute.
now,
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
on
the
marital
deduction
that
we
have
only
the
amount
of
the
property
that
passes,
the
only
question
of
valuation.
government
counsel
says
that
that
just
got
a
zero
value
simply
because
she
gave
away
the
property.
now,
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
benefit
to
her
but
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
tax
in
mr.
stapf's
estate?
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
yes,
sir,
it
is
solidly
increased.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
this
x
dollar
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
these
x
dollars
as
going
out
of
her
estate
is
going
out
of
her
property
over
which
she
has
control
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
and
not
the
property
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
that
comes
from
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
comes
from
him.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
now,
if
--
if
mr.
stapf
had
said,
"i'm
going
to
give
you
my
one-third
interest
in
these
lots
down
here
but
you
go
mortgage
them
and
--
and
take
all
the
money
in
that
you've
got
on
this
property
and
give
it
to
our
children."
that
i
think
is
definitely
a
charge
upon
that
particular
property.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
--
that's
another
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
that's
right.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
if
you
say
then
that
you're
going
to
levy
an
estate
tax
with
respect
to
the
property
that
she
gives
to
the
children.
you're
going
to
levy
an
estate
tax
upon
that
property
before
she
dies.
now,
that
$10
--
that
$10
that
comes
from
her
husband,
theoretically,
maybe
in
here
estate
when
she
dies
and
will
then
become
subject
to
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
no.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well
--
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
well,
it
was
the
provision
previously
taxed.
mr.
w.
m.
sutton
that's
--
that's
correct.
yes,
that
would
be
correct.
no
--
but
in
the
illustration,
the
$10
going
over
to
the
children,
if
it
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
an
estate
tax,
it's
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
tax
before
the
recipient
dies.
thank
you.
