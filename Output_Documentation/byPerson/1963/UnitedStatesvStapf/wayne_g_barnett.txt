mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
estate
tax
case.
it's
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
involves
two
entirely
separate
questions
and
i
will
state
the
facts
relevant
to
each
in
connection
with
the
discussion
of
that
question.
both
questions
are
i
think
very
simple
one.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
estate
was
entitled
to
a
marital
deduction
and
i
think
that
question
can
be
fairly
stated
as
being
whether
it
would
be
quest
of
property
for
surviving
wife
one
condition
that
she
conveys
property
of
equal
value
to
a
testator's
children
qualified
for
marital
deduction.
lowell
h.
stapf,
a
resident
of
texas
died
in
1953.
he
was
survived
by
his
wife.
at
the
date
of
his
death,
he
owned
as
in
separate
property
real
estate
valued
at
$65,000.
he
and
his
wife
together
own
as
community
property
assets
with
the
total
value
of
$258,000.
his
will
provided
that
all
of
his
property,
that
is
his
separate
property
and
his
half
of
the
community
property
were
to
go
--
was
to
go
to
a
trust
for
the
children
giving
nothing
to
his
wife
unless
she
consented
to
allow
all
of
the
community
property
to
pass
according
to
the
terms
of
the
will.
if
she
did
so
consent,
she
was
then
to
receive
one
third
of
everything,
one
third
of
his
separate
property,
plus
one
third
of
the
community
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
she
would
take
only
her
half
of
the
community
property
and
all
of
his
property,
his
half
of
the
community
property
plus
his
separate
property
would
go
to
a
trust
for
the
children.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
she
is
entitled
to
one-half
of
all
the
community
property
less
one-half
of
the
debts.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
of
the
community,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
she
would
have
taken
--
let
me
give
you
the
figures.
in
this
case,
had
she
not
taken
under
the
will,
had
she
just
stood
on
her
rights,
her
ownership
of
community
property,
she
would
receive
net
$111,000
with
the
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
result
texas
law,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
she
would
get
only
her
half
of
community
property
less
one-half
of
the
community
debts
and
that
would
net
out
to
be
$111,000.
she,
in
fact,
elected
to
comply
with
the
will
and
to
allow
the
property
to
pass
under
the
will.
under
the
will,
she
received
one-third
of
his
separate
property
which
is
worth
$22,000
and
kept
one-third
of
the
community
property
which
is
worth
$85,000,
which
totaled
$107,000.
that
is
by
electing
to
take
under
the
will,
she
in
fact
received
$4000
less
than
she
already
owned
by
virtue
of
her
half
interest
in
the
community
property.
so,
in
order
to
receive
$22,000
worth
of
the
decedent's
separate
property,
she
had
to
sacrifice
$26,000
worth
of
property
that
she
owned
in
her
own
right.
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
she
kept
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
she
--
under
the
will,
she
kept
at
30
of
the
property--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
which
is
$85,000.
otherwise,
she
would
have
$111,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
difference
between
(voice
overlap)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
which
is
$26,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
debts
really
don't
enter
in
to
this
part
of
the
case.
that's
really
the
second
question
and
i
will
develop
that
separately.
so,
the
question
is
whether
the
gift
to
the
spouse
of
$22,000
worth
of
separate
property
only
on
condition
that
she
give
$26,000
worth
of
her
property
to
the
trust
for
the
children
qualifies
for
the
marital
deduction.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
did
over
vigorous
dissent
by
judge
wisdom
and
i
think
on
reflection,
it's
evident
that
has
very
drastic
implications
because
what
it
means
really
is
that
a
gift
to
anyone
including
remote
decedents
can
be
made
to
qualify
to
the
marital
deduction
by
the
simple
device
of
its
first
exchanging
properties
with
the
surviving
wife
--
surviving
spouse.
all
its
necessary
is
to
precede
that
its
positive
provisions
of
the
will
with
a
provision
giving
the
property
to
the
wife
on
condition
that
she
convey
property
of
equal
value
in
accordance
with
the
remaining
terms
of
the
will.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
election
really
amounts
nothing
more
than
offer
made
in
the
will,
an
offer
that
i
will
trade
you
$122,000
worth
of
separate
my
property
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
not
an
election,
not
an
election
that
is
an
election
between
two
alternative
ways
of
receiving
property
by
descent
i.e.
between
dower
and
a
statutory
right,
knew
of
dower.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
election
between
two
alternative
kinds
of
inheritance.
she
owe
--
under
texas
law
she
independently
owned
one
half
of
the
community
property,
so
she
is
conveying
her
owned
property
in
exchange
for
his
transfer
to
her
under
his
will
of
a
share
of
his
separate
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
permissible
to
do
but
the
consequence
cannot
be
that
the
estate
is
entitled
to
marital
deduction.
i
hope
to
prove
by
giving
the
wife
less
than
she
must
give
to
receive
it
because
she
has
to
give
up
$26,000
to
receive
the
$22,000.
now,
i
think
that
would
be
clear
enough
even
if
the
statute
were
silent
on
the
question.
in
fact,
i've
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
limitation
on
the
marital
deduction
is
50%
on
just
the
gross
estate.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
the
full
bequest
would
part
of
their
argument,
that
limitation
is
not
applicable
here.
so,
anything
which
qualifies
as
a
deductible
bequest
to
the
widow
would
be
fully
deducted.
we
don't
reach
the
limitation
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
were
even
trade.
they
would
amount
in
our
view
simply
to
a
--
an
exchange
of
properties
not
a
gift
of
anything
to
the
wife
and
it's
only
for
gifts
to
the
wife
that
you
get
a
deduction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
a
testamentary
gift.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
statute
because
i
think
quite
surprisingly
the
statute
addresses
itself
to
the
very
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
these
circumstances,
the
widow
since
she
gave
up
more
than
she
got,
she
would
be
liable
for
gift
tax
on
the
excess
that
she
conveyed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes,
yes.
this
question
is
not
at
all
dependent
from
a
community
property
aspect.
the
--
exactly
identical
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
question
--
it's
not
a
marital
deduction
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
is
i
think
peculiar
to
community
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
it
is.
well,
it
depends
on
what
implications
you
read
in
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
if
you
read
it
in
a
broadest
way,
you
might
find
that
applicable
in
common
law
analogies,
but
i
don't
think
it
really
meant
to
hold
anything
that
goes
beyond
in
community
property.
was
i
answering
the
question?
i'm
sorry.
let
me
go
on
to
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
statute
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
to
page
26,
section
812
(e)
(1)
of
the
1939
code.
sub-section
--
sub-paragraph
(a)
grants
a
deduction
from
gross
estate,
the
so-called
marital
deduction
for
an
amount
equal
to
the
value
of
any
interest
in
property
which
passes
or
has
passed
from
the
descendent
to
a
surviving
spouse.
sub-paragraph
(e)
provides
that
in
valuing
the
interest
which
passes
to
the
surviving
spouse
for
that
purpose,
where
such
interest
or
property
isn't
encumbered
in
any
manner
or
where
the
surviving
spouse
incurs
any
obligation
imposed
by
the
descendent
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
such
interest,
such
encumbrance
or
obligation
shall
be
taken
into
account
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
amount
of
a
gift
to
such
spouse
would
be
determined.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
cannot
be
denied
that
the
--
a
requirement
that
the
widow
in
order
to
receive
the
bequest
convey
property
of
her
own
to
a
third
party
is
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
descendent
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
the
interest.
now,
the
petitioners
--
the
respondents
do
challenge
that,
but
i
--
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
reading
such
a
limitation
into
this
language.
specific
--
particularly
is
that
true
because
all
this
provision
does
is
to
incorporate
the
general
principles
for
determining
the
value
of
a
gift
to
any
particular
donee
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
corporation
would
incorporate
only
a
part
of
those
principles.
this
is
simply
a
general
reference
to
the
general
principle
for
determining
the
value
of
a
gift.
i'm
indebted
in
fact
to
respondents
referring
in
their
brief
at
page
19,
a
part
of
the
committee
report
that
we
did
not
set
out
which
says
as
much.
it
says,
"describes
the
purpose
of
this
provision
as
providing
for
the
application
in
determining
the
value
of
any
interest
in
property
passing
to
the
surviving
spouse
of
rules
which
are
generally
applicable
in
determining
the
net
value
of
any
gift
or
bequest.
"
this
is
simply
an
incorporation
of
the
rules
otherwise
generally
applicable.
now,
where
those
rules,
the
context
in
which
we
have
to
look
for
those
rules
is
in
the
context
where
the
identity
of
the
donee
is
important
because
the
statute
asked
not
simply
how
much
--
how
you
will
determine
the
total
amount
of
a
gift
made
by
the
grantor?
here,
since
the
descendent
has
died,
he
certainly
has
given
to
somebody
everything
he
owned.
what
it
asked
is
how
you
determine
the
amount
of
the
gift
to
such
spouse,
to
that
particular
donee
and
it's
there
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
astray
and
ignored
that
trade.
now,
the
context
in
which
the
identity
of
the
donee
is
important,
are
many.
for
income
tax
purposes,
the
charitable
contribution
deduction
depends
upon
whether
the
gift
is
to
a
charity.
for
gift
tax
purposes,
the
identity
of
the
donee
controls
not
only
the
charitable
contribution
deduction
and
the
marital
deduction
but
also
whether
--
the
extent
to
which
a
--
the
$3000
annual
exclusion
is
available
which
is
limited
to
$3000
of
gifts
to
anyone
donee
whether
the
gift
splitting
privilege
is
available,
whether
the
donee
is
or
who
is
secondarily
liable
for
the
gift
tax
because
the
donee
is
liable
for
the
gift
tax
if
it
isn't
paid
by
the
donor.
now
--
so
in
all
of
those
contexts,
we
do
have
a
problem
on
identifying
who
the
donee
of
what
part
of
the
gift
is
and
that
is
the
context
that
the
estate
tax
statute
refers
to
and
i
assert
that
in
every
such
context,
a
gift,
a
transfer
from
a
to
b
on
condition
that
b
make
a
transfer
to
c
is
a
gift
by
a
to
c
and
not
a
gift
to
b.
b
is
simply
an
intermediary
who
makes
an
exchange
of
properties.
now,
i
--
several
examples
i
think
will
make
that
very
clear.
if
i
--if
i
give
$10,000
to
charity,
one
condition
that
the
charity
delivers
a
hundred
shares
of
stock
worth
a
$100
of
shared
to
my
son,
no
one
would
suggest
that
i
am
entitled
to
a
charitable
contribution
deduction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
i
give
$10,000
to
a
stockbroker
on
condition
that
he
convey
the
shares
of
stock
to
a
charity,
i
would
be
entitled
to
the
charitable
contribution
deduction.
likewise,
if
i
asked
the
stockbroker
to
deliver
the
stock
to
my
son,
i
think
the
stockbroker
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
a
donee
who
is
secondary
liable
to
the
gift
tax.
he
might
be
even
more
pleasantly
surprised
when
it
dawns
on
him
that
since
it
was
gift,
he
wouldn't
have
to
report
it
for
income
tax
purposes.
again,
if
i'd
already
given
$3000
to
my
son
so
i
couldn't
take
another
annual
exclusion
for
gift
to
him,
i
don't
suppose
i
could
claim
one
by
showing
that
i
never
made
a
gift
to
the
stockbroker.
so,
every
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
obligation
imposed
by
the
descendent
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
interest.
i
have
said
and
i
think
it
is
evident
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
a
requirement
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
not
--
not
that
we
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
it's
an
obligation
imposed
with
respect
to
the
passing
of
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
by
my
first
answer
literally,
this
is
an
obligation
imposed,
i.e.,
a
requirement
that
in
order
to
receive
it,
you
must
do
something
is
an
obligation
imposed
with
respect
to
a
passing
of
an
interest.
and
secondly,
that
the
community
reports
made
clear
that
all
this
is,
is
a
general
reference
to
the
general
rules
to
determine
the
amount
of
a
gift
to
a
particular
person.
that's
the
only
reason
for
this
provision
being
there
which
confirms
my
reading
of
obligation
is
not
meaning
in
its
specific
kind
of
obligation.
the
--
now,
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
well,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
than
any
other
context
there's
no
gift
from
a
to
b
but
b
is
required
to
make
a
transfer
to
c
as
a
condition
of
receiving
the
gift
except
to
the
extent
that
the
transfer
to
b
exceeds
the
transfer
that
he
is
require
to
make
to
c
and
i
say
that
that
provision
of
estate
tax
provision
--
of
the
estate
tax
on
a
section
specifically
incorporates
those
general
principles
and
that's
why
it
is
there.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
anything
that
--
that
his
will
gives
certain
excess
of
what
she
is
required
to
give
the
children
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
since
in
this
case,
she
had
to
give
up
more
than
she
got
to
marital
deduction
and
i
--
that
really
is
our
case
on
the
marital
deduction
question.
i
think
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
the
second
question
--
let
me
add
the
regulations
are
very
specific
on
this
question.
they
clearly
--
they
have
example
which
is
in
this
very
case
that
submitted
by
respondent,
submitted
by
the
court
of
appeals
respondent
from
(inaudible)
only
by
holding
that
regulation
is
invalid.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
estate
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
the
share
of
the
community
debts
that
would
otherwise
be
chargeable
to
the
wife's
half
of
the
community
property.
now,
i
say
there's
a
similar
question
involving
the
administration
expenses,
but
since
the
debts
are
much
more
important
in
amount
and
we
--
both
parties
agreed
to
be
controlled
by
the
same
principles,
i
would
make
the
oral
argument
in
terms
of
the
debts
but
not
specifically
touch
under
administration
expenses.
the
community
estate,
which
in
texas
law,
it
has
an
independent
existence
from
the
husband
and
wife
individually.
the
community
estate
had
asset
of
$258,000
as
i
have
said.
it
also
had
debts
of
$32,000
which
consisted
primarily
of
income
taxes
owing
on
community
income.
now,
only
one-half
of
the
community
assets
were
includable
in
the
decedent's
estate
admittedly
and
our
argument
is
that
only
one-half
of
the
community
debts
were
deductable
from
it.
now
the
decedent's
will,
however
written,
contained
a
provision
directing
his
executors
to
pay
all
of
the
community
debts,
not
merely
one
half,
out
of
his
half
of
the
community
property
because
of
that
provision,
the
estate
claims
that
it
is
entitled
to
deduction
for
all
of
the
community
debts.
that
is
both
which
half
allocable
to
his
half
and
half
allocable
to
her
half
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
the
claim
again,
judge
wilson
dissenting.
now,
i
would
like
to
start
the
statute
on
this
provision
is
at
page
25
of
our
brief
and
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
deducted
from
the
gross
estate
such
amounts
for
claims
against
the
estate
as
are
allowable
under
the
laws
of
the
jurisdiction
administering
the
estate
--
the
estate,
and
it's
page
25
and
that
is
controlling
provision
here,
that's
clause
3
is
the
one
directly
relevant.
i'd
like
to
(inaudible)
there's
no
disagreement
at
all,
between
the
parties
or
with
the
courts
below,
that
in
the
absence
of
the
will
provision,
all
that
the
estate
could've
been
required
to
pay
in
order
that
it
could've
deducted
would
have
been
one
half
of
the
community
debts.
under
texas
law,
the
community
debts
or
the
primary
obligation
of
the
community
and
upon
this
dissolution,
they're
chargeable
one-half
against
each
share.
the
husband
is
the
manager
of
the
community
is
personally
liable
for
community
debts
but
the
wife
is
not.
but,
as
between
him
and
the
community,
his
liability
is
only
secondary
and
if
he
pays
the
debts
on
his
personal
separate
property,
he's
entitled
to
reimbursement
from
the
community.
therefore,
it
is
established
from
the
texas
law
then
of
the
death
of
a
husband,
the
probate
court
which
typically
administers
both
the
entire
community
estate
and
his
separate
estate,
the
probate
court
may
charge
against
the
decedent's
estate
only
one-half
of
the
community
debt
and
must
charge
the
other
half
against
the
wife
share
of
the
community
property.
that's
in
the
absence
of
the
will.
i
want
to
emphasize,
there's
no
disagreement
about
that.
it's
common
ground
that
--
but
for
the
will
provision,
the
wife
share
evidence
would
not
be
claims
against
the
estate
which
were
deductible.
it
is
only
the
effect
of
the
will
provision
is
an
issue.
and
the
question
is,
whether
that
direction
in
the
will,
the
direction
of
will
for
the
payment
of
the
wife's
share
of
the
debts
converts
her
share
of
the
debts
--
the
share
of
the
debts
would
otherwise
be
chargeable
against
her
half
of
the
property
into
claims
against
the
estate
and
we
say
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
under
texas
law,
legacies,
they
are
also
enforceable.
any
provision
of
the
will
which
is
a
valid
provision
of
the
will
is
enforceable
and
it
is
quite
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
precisely.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
it
would
--
it
would
qualify
generally
for
the
marital
deduction.
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
qualify
the
marital
deduction
for
the
reason
i've
already
discussed
because
she
had
to
give
up
more
than
she
got
anyway.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
a
collateral
aspect
of
this
which
i'd
hope
not
to
get
in
to
at
oral
argument,
still
within
our
brief
a
long
footnote
here,
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
note
17.
actually,
you
see
the
provision
directing
payment
of
all
of
the
debts
out
of
his
half
of
the
community
property
was
also
conditioned
upon
her
election
to
take
under
the
will.
so
she
had
to
give
up,
the
figures
i've
been
using
$26,000
and
$22,000
would
both
be
increased
by
the
$16,000
worth
of
debts
and
it
would
amount
really
--
his
assumption
of
her
debts
really
would
increase
her
interest
in
the
community
property,
then
she
has
to
give
up
that
much
more
in
order
to
get
his
--
a
share
of
his
separate
property.
so,
that
would
again
work
out.
i
don't
want
to
try
to
persuade
you
to
the
figure
is
here,
would
again
work
out,
she
giving
up
more
than
she
got.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
on
our
first
ground
so
we
don't
really
have
that
problem
here.
well,
i
agree
but
generally,
a
provision
in
a
decedent's
will
pay
to
his
wife's
debts
would
qualify
for
marital
deduction.
now,
our
argument
on
this
question
is
again
a
very
simple
one.
in
our
view,
the
very
essence
of
the
claim
and
the
only
reason
why
it's
allowed
as
a
deduction
is
that
it
is
enforceable
against
the
estate
regardless
of
the
testator's
wishes
and
that
therefore
reduces
the
net
value
of
the
property
over
which
she
has
testamentary
power.
and
something
that
it
is
payable
by
the
executors
only
because
the
decedent
exercised
his
testamentary
power
to
direct
the
payment
is
not
a
claim
against
his
estate.
it
is,
as
judge
wisdom
described
it,
merely
straight
pecuniary
legacy.
there's
no
difference,
we
say,
between
a
$1000
legacy
to
a
beneficiary
and
the
direction
to
the
executors
to
pay
a
$1000
debt
that
would
otherwise
be
the
primary
obligation
of
the
beneficiary.
in
short,
it's
our
position
is
that
since
without
the
will,
he
is
staying
within
required
to
pay
only
one-half
of
the
debts,
only
one-half
of
the
debts
were
claimed
against
his
estate
enforceable
against
the
estate
and
only
one-half
of
the
debts
were
deductible
from
the
estate
and
for
that
reason,
both
in
this
issue
and
on
the
first,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i
think
that's
common
ground.
i
don't
think
(inaudible)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
well,
the
clerk
tells
me
it's
not
entirely
unprecedented.
i
--
i
think
the
court
would
like
to
know
that
since
this
argument
began,
i'd
become
a
father,
and
mother
and
daughter
were
doing
fine.
as
to
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
since
the
argument
began,
i'd
become
a
father.
i
just
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
to
the
other
reasons
for
reversal,
i
have
a
--
a
few
comments.
first,
the
mathematics
of
the
marital
--
the
mathematics
of
the
marital
deduction,
a
question,
assuming
that
the
assumption
of
the
debt
is
to
be
treated
as
a
legacy,
the
question
raised
by
justice
harlan
and
justice
white.
they're
actually
very
simple.
the
figures
i
used
yesterday
to
state
for
bargain
made
by
the
will,
started
with
the
net
figure
of
$111,000
as
the
wife's
share
of
the
property.
that
was
after
the
deduction
of
the
debts
and
expenses.
now,
starting
with
the
gross
value
of
her
share
of
the
community
property
and
restating
in
the
bargain
in
those
terms,
the
bargain
that
is
offered
by
the
will
would
be
this.
you
have
$129,000
worth
of
community
property,
gross
community
property,
$129,000.
if
you
will
convey
all
but
$85,000
of
that,
let's
say,
you
convey
$44,000
of
that
to
the
trust
for
the
children,
i
would
do
two
things.
i
will
give
you
$22,000
worth
of
my
property
and
i
will
also
pay
$18,000
worth
of
your
debts
and
expenses.
therefore,
if
you
will
give
to
the
children
$44,000,
i
will
give
you
the
benefit
of
$40,000,
so
she
still
comes
out
$4000
down.i
hope
that's
clear.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
the
whole
case.
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
--
quite
that
simple.
the
--
i
--
i
might
point
that
property
previously
tax
provision,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
still
in
the
statute,
actually,
it's
now
become
a
credit
and
it
doesn't
really
overlap
now
deduction
problem,
i
--
i
don't
believe.
the
--
and
--
but
this
relates
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
his
argument
--
there's
a
double
tax
here
because
the
husband
gave
her
a
specific
piece
of
property,
blackacre,
and
blackacre
is
going
to
be
in
her
estate
and
be
taxed
in
her
estate.
now,
we
accept
the
assumption
he
makes
that
what
she
receives
will
remain
her
estate.
i
think
that's
a
valid
assumption
to
make
these
purposes.
but
problem
is
--
or
the
blackacre
will
be
in
her
estate.securities
of
the
same
value
are
now
out
of
her
estate,
so
it
washes
out
and
what
the
estate
tax
taxes
is
economic
value,
it's
not
--
not
specific
pieces
of
property,
blackacre
or
stock,
and
it
is
--
she
gets
a
deduction
but
his
estate
gets
deduction
only
for
transfer
of
economic
values
to
--
to
the
wife
and
here
there
was
no
such
transfer.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
only
gift
she
made
to
the
trust
was
the
excess
of
$26,000
over
22,
namely,
$4000
more
she
added
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
she
received
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
she
received
consideration
for
her
transfer
and
any
transfer
for
which
you
receive
consideration
is
a
gift
only
of
the
excess
over
the
consideration.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
of
--
of
the
$26,000
that
ends
up
in
the
children's
trust.
we
say
that
$22,000
of
that
came
from
the
estate
indirectly
by
the
exchange
but
it
came
from
the
estate
and
should
be
subject
to
estate
tax.
the
additional
$4000
was
the
wife's
contribution
and
she
is
liable
for
gift
tax
on
that
amount.
thank
you
very
much.
