required
the
marital
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that's
--
i
don't
see
why
that
reaches
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
these
debts,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
that
the
result
here
is
to
put
both
(inaudible)
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
suggest
that
the
result
here
is
to
put
both
in
the
estate
and
--
and
the
gift
tax
on
any
amount
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
on
the
same
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
neither
be
one
of
the
others,
you
object
to
putting
the
higher
estate
tax
on
the
amount
to
pass
in
the
wife
to
the
trust
rather
than
a
gift
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
won't
be
both
--
there
won't
be
both
taxes
under
$26,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
on
the
22
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
$22,000
that
she
received
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
wasn't
this
the
same
type
of
a
--
of
a
so-called
legacy
to
the
wife
as
these
other
amounts
that
you
out
pay
your
debts
if
you'll
give
an
equal
amount
to
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
otherwise,
he
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
wouldn't
have
as
much
to
give
--
she
wouldn't
have
as
much
of
her
half
in
the
community
property
left
if
--
if
she'd
had
to
pay
her
own
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
exact
--
exactly
the
same
amount.
she
would
have
more
--
she
would
have
left
--
she
would
have
had
more
of
her
separate
proper
or
her
half
of
the
community
property
to
give
away
if
the
estate
hadn't
paid
her
debts,
so
it
seems
to
me,
it's
sort
of
a
washout.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
he
says,
"i'll
pay
your
debt
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'll
pay
your
debt
if
you'll
give
the
same
amount
to
--
to
the
children,
in
effect."
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
economic
effect
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
$16,000
more
went
to
the
children,
i
understand,
if
the
estate
hadn't
paid
her
half
of
the
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
went
to
the
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
will
only
be
irrelevant
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
her
husband
--
if
her
husband
pays
all
the
community
debts,
can
he
get
the
contribution
from
the
spouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
need
--
but
his
estate
need
not
pay
all
the
community
debts.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
if
the
martial
deduction
that
her
estate
is
--
is
--
that
is
solidly
increased
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
x
--
x
dollars
comes
in
on
condition
that
y
--
x
dollars
goes
out,
she's
automatically
--
this
isn't
--
this
doesn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
doesn't
comport
with
the
idea
--
with
the
assumption
that
this
--
this
property
will
remain
in
her
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
make
it
as
--
make
it
as
simple,
leave
mortgages
out,
say
i
--
i'd
--
i
say
in
my
will
to
my
wife,
"you
have
$100
in
your
separate
property,
i'm
going
to
give
you
$10
if
you'll
take
$10
out
of
your
$100
and
give
it
to
our
children."
now,
is
the
--
is
that
$10
that
i
give
to
her
qualifies
to
the
marital
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sir,
it
does
because
you
are
--
you
are
taxing
the
$10
and
we're
concerned
with
the
estate
taxes
in
mr.
stapf's
estate.
that's
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
now,
when
she
gives
the
$10
to
the
children
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
idea
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
marital
deduction,
i
thought,
was
that
--
was
that
the
$10
that
i
left
her
would
increase
her
estate
to
$110
and
that
except
for
wear
and
tear
and
new
husbands
might
stay
in
her
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
automatically,
i
prevent
that
in
my
will
by
saying,
"you
must
divest
yourself
of
$10
(inaudible)."
justice
byron
r.
white
but
before
the
martial
deduction,
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
there
was
a
martial
deduction,
you
didn't
--
the
husband
didn't
have
deduction
at
all
for
the
amounts
that
he
gave
to
his
wife,
did
he?
