mr.

--

well,
if
she
takes
against
the

if
i
understand
you
correctly

--
all
she
gets
is
her
half
of
this
community
property
--
justice

stewart
which
she
--
which
she
would
have
whether

always
her.

right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
that
the
regulation
covers
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
repeat
my
question.
you
concede
that
the
regulation,
that
the
words
of
the
regulation
cover
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
relationship
of
the
gift
tax
rates
to
the
estate
tax
rates
was
a
two-third?
justice
potter
stewart
around
about
two
--
two-thirds
although
it's
yours,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
more
--
more
of
a
difference,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
way
to
the
gift
tax
rates
are
lower,
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
be
a
provision
for
property
previously
taxed
before
the
marital
deduction
provision
in
1948.
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
be
a
provision
for
property
previously
taxed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
five
years,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
not
confined
the
spouse
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
one
thing.
