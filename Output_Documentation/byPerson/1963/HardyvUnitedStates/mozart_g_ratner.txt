mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
district
of
columbia,
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
an
indigent
convict
confronted
with
the
district
court
finding
that
his
appeal
or
would
be
appeal
is
not
taken
in
good
faith
is
entitled
to
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
to
unable
his
court
appointed
counsel
to
search
for
hidden
error.
for
us,
it
is
both
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
argument
that
in
the
federal
system,
in
the
first
place
under
rule
52
(b)
hidden
error
is
ground
for
reversal.
and
in
the
second
place
that
a
solvent
defendant
can
provide
his
counsel
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
to
search.
that
brings
denial
of
a
complete
transcript
to
an
indigent
squarely
within
douglas
against
california,
"where
the
errors
are
hidden,
the
indigent
has
only
the
right
to
a
meaningless
ritual,
while
the
rich
man
has
a
meaningful
appeal.”
the
governments
says,
“so
what?”
the
gap
is
only
a
product
of
the
indigent's
poverty
and
government
is
not
required
to
equalize
economic
condition.
but
when
the
consequence
of
poverty
is
inability
to
defend
a
criminal
conviction,
overcoming
the
disability
is
not
to
equalize
economic
condition.
it
is
to
equalize
the
criminal
justice
under
law.
if
government
is
under
no
obligation
to
overcome
the
disabilities
of
poverty
when
it
under
takes
a
criminal
prosecution
or
would
borrow
criminal
appeal,
why
should
it
have
to
supply
an
indigent
with
counsel
or
with
any
record
at
all?
government
is
constitutionally
required
to
do
these
things
because
in
administering
criminal
justice,
it
must
overcome
disabilities
resulting
from
poverty
just
as
much
as
it
practically
can.
in
norvell
versus
illinois,
this
court
held
that
the
state
was
not
obliged
to
supply
a
transcript
because
through
no
fault
of
the
state,
the
transcript
was
simply
unavailable.
the
inescapable
implication
is
that
the
transcript
had
been
available.
the
state
would
have
been
compelled
to
supply
it.
what
otherwise
could
we
possibly
mean
when
we
claim
to
provide
in
our
system
equal
justice
under
law
for
the
rich
and
for
the
poor.
to
deny
a
poor
man
the
appellant
review
which
is
available
to
a
convict
with
money
is
to
mock
the
very
idea
of
equality,
nothing
could
be
more
damaging
to
democracy
at
home
or
abroad
than
the
notion
that
to
us,
the
majestic
equality
of
which
the
law
speaks
means
only
that
the
rich
and
the
poor
alike
have
no
right
to
sleep
under
bridges,
to
beg
in
the
streets
and
to
steal
bread.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
fact
of
this
case
your
honor,
that
this
poor
man
was
denied
a
stenographic
transcript
in
which
his
counsel
could
search
for
hidden
error
which
a
poor
convict
identically
situated
could
provide
to
his
counsel
to
search
for
error
in
order
to
defend
against
the
charge
of
frivolity.
i
submit
that
the
right
to
take
the
appeal
depends
upon
the
right
to
search
for
the
hidden
error
in
a
complete
transcript.
and
if
that
is
withheld
from
the
indigent
conflict,
he
is
being
deprived
of
equal
justice
under
law.
for
whatever
right
of
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction,
the
lower
courts
in
practice
to
a
rich
man,
it
must
in
practice
and
able
to
poor
man
equally
to
enjoy
and
to
deny
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you!
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
this
court
is
held
that
to
deny
a
poor
man
the
right
to
appeal
for
one
of
a
filling
fee,
is
to
deny
an
equal
justice
under
law.
i
said
that
to
deny
poor
man
appeal
for
warrant
of
the
opportunity
to
search
the
transcript
--
the
trial
of
which
he
was
convicted
is
no
different
to
deny
him
the
right
to
appeal
for
one
of
a
filling
fee
because
if
he
had
the
money
to
buy
the
transcript,
if
he
could
buy
the
transcript,
he
might
be
find
the
error
and
if
the
error
is
there
and
he
can't
find
it,
if
he
had
it
and
could
appeal
if
he
found
it,
you're
denying
him
the
equal
right
to
appeal.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
let
me
say
at
the
onset
and
i'll
return
to
that
in
a
couple
of
minutes
in
more
detail,
but
this
dispose
it
right
now.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
any
system
which
makes
hidden
error
a
ground
for
reversal
and
does
it
reply
a
proper
observation
and
notice
and
preservation
of
the
point
below
carries
with
it
inevitably
the
requirement
of
the
opportunity
to
find
the
error
be
accorded.
and
when
you
add
to
that,
that
in
the
federal
system,
alright,
any
state
system
that
adds
to
that
the
rule
that
any
paying
defendant
has
a
right
to
buy
an
opportunity
to
buy
the
whole
transcript
then
i
say
juxtaposition
this
court
is
held
and
i
think
due
process
and
equal
protection
both
jointly
are
denied
by
the
denial
to
the
man
for
indigency
of
the
juxtaposition
of
those
privileges
to
search
in
a
complete
transcript
for
hidden
error.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i'm
arguing
at
a
--
all
levels
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
constitutional
level,
on
the
policy
level,
on
the
level
that
this
is
the
federal
system
and
not
a
state
system
and
--
and
matters
of
general
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
oh
i'm
feeling
to
supervisor
power
this
court
as
well
as
view
the
constitution.
this
argument
happens
to
be
pitched
to
the
constitution
because
i
think
the
policy
notions
permeate
if
not
that
far,
far
enough
for
my
purpose.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
right
mr.
justice
black
always.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
correct.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
right.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
justice
goldberg.
as
a
practical
matter,
absolutely
impossible
if
the
error
is
hidden,
and
i
mean
absolutely
impossible
if
the
error
is
hidden
to
find
it
without
searching
this
--
the
transcript
because
by
definition,
if
it's
hidden,
the
trial
court
doesn't
know
about
it.
if
it
escapes
the
trial
counsel
when
he
tried
the
case,
he
obviously
hasn't
discovered
it
since
the
end
of
trial.
the
court
reporter
on
reading
it
may
or
may
not
revealed
it,
but
the
chances
are
he
won't
because
appellant
lawyers
know
generally
that
the
place
you
get
your
idea
is
by
reading
and
pondering
a
transcript
and
not
by
hearing
somebody
talked
about
it.
the
consequence
is
that
you
just
cannot
meet
the
yellow
standard.
it's
impossible
to
meet
the
yellow
for
--
pointed
counsel
meet
the
yellow
standard
without
a
transcript.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
i
--
my
argument
is
pitched
and
i
tried
to
indicate
that
to
my
answer
mr.
justice
harlan.
my
argument
is
pitched
exclusively
to
those
judicial
systems
in
which
there
is
a
plain
error
rule
and
which
a
transcript
exist
automatically
for
price.
those
are
the
two
--
between
premises
in
the
argument,
i
think
they
carry
even
a
constitutional
verdict.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no
your
honor
there
was
not.
it
was
a
two
to
one
decision
judge
may
dissent.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
made
not.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
that
it's
broader
than
a
local
determination
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
think
it
is
even
--
even
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
with
respect
for
the
entire
federal
system
but
it
isn't
localized
to
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
a
fourth
circuit
decision
that
i
went
in
to
the
other
day
that
became
down
in
may
that
carries
over
ton
of
implications
by
the
judge
schwellenbach
and
then
in
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit.
they
too
do
not
believe
that
the
on
counsel
for
indigent
is
entitled
to
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
search
for
error.
i
think
that
the
minimum
what
we
invoked
here
is
the
--
the
power
of
this
court
supervisor
administrative
justice,
the
administration
of
justice
throughout
the
federal
system
in
the
federal
courts
and
not
merely
the
district
of
columbia
that's
not
applied
there.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
i
believe
so.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
confess
that
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
that
it
did
--
well,
the
notion
that
the
transcript
ought
to
be
denied
in
the
federal
system
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
somehow
converses
responsible
for
this
result.
and
then
i
think
it's
based
done
on
misreading
of
28
u.s.c.
section
1915.
the
assumptions
are
that
under
that
statute,
the
indigent
unlike
the
solvent
defendant
either
has
the
one
assumed
the
burden
of
proving
substantiality
or
to
specify
errors
as
a
condition
of
being
allowed
to
appeal
in
the
form
of
proverbs.
now,
if
either
of
those
disparities
really
existed,
if
congress
really
provided
for
that,
then
a
serious
constitutional
question
would
be
presented.
but
copied,
as
we
read
it
put
an
end
to
the
first
idea.
the
burden
is
not
on
the
indigent
but
on
the
government
to
prove
insubstantiality
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
second
section
which
lends
the
slightest
support
to
the
second
idea.
all
that
section
1915
requires
is
that
the
convict
state
in
his
affidavit,
"the
nature
of
the
action
defense
or
appeal
and
defiance
belief
that
he's
entitled
to
redress."
if
the
indigent
is
not
required
to
specify
errors
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
how
can
it
possibly
be
argued
that
congress
tried
the
indigents
appointed
counsel
to
those
portions
of
the
record
which
relate
to
errors
that
the
indigent
pro
se
has
superfluously
specified.
the
only
semblance
of
plausibility
as
we
see
it
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
section
1915
does
say
that
in
appeal
may
not
be
taken
inform
of
papyrus,
if
the
trial
court
certifies
in
writing
that
it
is
not
taken
in
good
faith.
the
consequence
of
that
provision
is
that
where
the
error
is
hidden,
the
indigenous
confronted
with
the
district
court
finding
of
frivolity
before
his
appellant
counsel
has
even
with
a
chance
to
look
at
the
record
whereas
the
solvent
defendant
cannot
be
faced
with
a
challenged
on
frivolity
ground
until
his
appellant
counsel
has
either
filed
his
statement
of
points
on
appeal
or
has
filed
his
brief
on
the
merits.
rule
75
(b),
if
the
federal
has
criminal
procedures
specifically
provide
that
no
assignment
of
errors
is
necessary,
we
take
it
that
that
is
true
in
the
form
of
papyrus
case
as
much
than
any
other.
it
is
only
if
the
appellant
does
not
designate
for
inclusion
the
complete
record
at
all
the
proceedings
and
evidence
in
the
action
that
he's
required
to
serve
with
his
designation
a
concise
statement
of
the
points
on
which
he
intense
to
rely
on
appeal.
now
of
course,
before
any
paid
lawyer
would
file
a
statement
of
points
on
appeal,
he
will
have
coned
the
entire
stenographic
record
for
every
piece
of
reversible
error
he
can
possibly
find.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
really
different
point.
what
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
that
even
--
even
counsel
would
try
the
case
would
be
entitled
to
a
second
crack
at
the
record.
suppose
he
hadn't
seen
it
before,
suppose
that
it
hadn't
been
prepared
until
the
time
of
the
appeal,
he
would
be
entitled
at
the
time
he
noted
the
appeal
it
seems
to
me
or
requested
leave
to
appeal
when
he
came
in
to
the
--
to
that
stage
of
consideration
of
his
case.
suppose
he
representative
throughout,
he
would
be
equally
entitled
to
have
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
to
make
the
initial
decision
as
to
whether
he's
going
to
take
this
case
up
unless
than
a
complete
transcript
or
he
wants
a
complete
transcript
because
that's
going
to
determine
whether
he
makes
a
statement
of
points
on
appeal
or
not.
and
then
he
can't
do
until
he
is
studying
and
finding
the
transcript
and
decided
what
is
better
in
--
in
this
case.
if
paid
counsel
has
that
opportunity
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
if
he
has
that
and
it's
worthwhile
that
he
haven't
--
and
if
for
worthwhile
he
wouldn't
--
rules
wouldn't
provide
to
him,
that
account
be
withheld
from
an
indigent.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
exactly
right.
my
argument
comes
precise
--
on
this
point
comes
precisely
to
that.
it
says
that
the
notion
that
you
can
require
an
indigent
as
a
condition
of
determining
either
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
haven't
but
there
are
some
figures
in
the
amicus
brief
and
there
are
some
figures
in
the
--
quoted
in
poverty
and
the
administration
of
federal
criminal
justice,
they
reported
the
attorney
general's
committee.
but
i
am
not
all
sure
and
certainly
the
amicus
brief
persuasively
argued
at
least
persuasively
to
me
that
the
financial
burden
will
not
be
a
heavy
one.
for
me,
i
don't
reach
the
question
because
i
just
don't
think
the
united
states
can
weigh
dollar,
the
justice
on
the
same
scale.
we
submit
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
have
no
idea
your
honor.
i
--
i
did
never
saw
the
transcript
and
they
didn't
give
it
to
me
and
the
part
i
saw
of
it
was
very
big,
it
was
one
volume.
but
i
can
imagine
that
it
may
have
been
--
oh
there's
no
point
in
my
guessing,
i
don't
know.
much
what
i
would
have
known
if
i
had
gotten
the
transcript,
i
don't
know.
we
submit
that
the
minimum
constitutional
condition
of
requiring
indigents
to
face
a
frivolity
hurdle
at
an
earlier
state
then
solvent
defendants
have
to
face
it,
is
that
indigent's
counsel
must
be
provided
with
the
same
opportunity
paid
counsel
have
to
search
the
record
for
ammunition
to
meet
such
an
effect.
that
means
that
the
entire
stenographic
record
must
be
made
available
promptly
to
appointed
counsel
faced
for
the
finding
of
frivolity.
the
government
says
this
distracts
the
tracks
unduly
from
the
weight
that
was
be
given
to
the
district
court's
finding
of
frivolity,
but
the
government
is
very
significantly
silent
about
the
duty
that
ellison
poses
both
on
counsel
and
on
the
courts
of
appeals
to
search
diligently
for
error
with
which
to
upset
the
district
court.
it
is
that
word
as
--
we
remarked,
determined
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
goldberg
which
this
court
has
never
envisage
it
seems
to
me
before
in
this
context
in
which
requires
the
result
for
which
we
contempt.
restriction
of
transcripts
to
indigents
explained
as
a
safeguard
against
the
wasteful
abuse
of
the
appellant
process.
but
as
long
as
the
plain
error
rules
stand
withholding
a
full
transcript
from
indigents
could
be
justified
only
if
there
were
some
connection
between
the
defendant's
solvency
and
the
potentiality
of
unnoticed
error
so
that
there
would
be
less
chance
on
hidden
error
in
indigent's
cases
than
in
other.
well,
there
is
a
connection,
alright,
but
it
works
just
the
other
way
around.
this
court
observed
in
coppedge
that
forma
pauperis
defendants
are
generally
less
ably
defended
in
the
trial
court
than
solvent
one.
therefore,
it
is
more
not
less
likely
that
the
records
in
the
case
of
the
indigent
will
contain
unnoticed
plain
error.
obviously
therefore,
to
make
ability
to
pay
the
test
for
opportunity
to
search
a
record
for
unnoticed
error
is
that
their
impunity
of
invidious
discrimination.
of
course
as
i
say,
our
argument
would
have
no
relevancy
in
a
judicial
system
in
which
no
appeal
can
be
taken
except
for
errors
noted
and
preserved
the
law.
this,
we
think,
is
all
this
court
had
in
mind
when
it
reaffirmed
in
draper
versus
washington,
griffin
statement
that
a
state
did
not
provide
parts
of
the
stenographic
transcript
which
are
not
germane
to
an
appeal
nor
our
courts
need
we
be
concerned
about
problems
which
may
exist
when
transcript
tuck
unavailable,
for
congress
is
to
make
sure
that
in
the
federal
system,
transcripts
are
available,
and
where
a
transcript
is
available,
government
must
supply
it.
every
appellate
lawyer
knows
that
in
searching
for
hidden
error,
there
can
be
no
substitute
for
a
stenographic
transcript.
thank
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
may
it
please
the
court.
to
me,
the
one
thing
that
mr.
claiborne's
discussion
of
the
shifting
sands
of
court
of
appeals
policy
has
done
is
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
assumption
which
mr.
harlan
indulged
when
he
asked
mr.
claiborne
what
this
case
was
about.
namely,
whether
assuming
congress
has
spoken
on
this
subject,
then
are
we
who
reverse
congress.
if
congress
has
spoken
on
this
subject,
how
does
it
happen
that
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
can
decide
to
grant
indigents
without
making
anymore
claim
of
error
than
has
been
made
in
this
case,
a
full
transcript
if
the
cost
is
under
$200
but
not
if
it's
over
it?
where
in
the
statutes
does
it
say
that
it
equals
an
appeal
to
give
a
transcript
if
the
cost
is
under
$200
but
it
doesn't
equal
an
appeal
if
the
cost
is
over
$200?
where
in
section
1915
or
any
other
statute
of
the
code
does
it
say
that
in
order
to
honor
the
district
court's
certificate
of
frivolity,
you
must
deny
a
transcript
to
an
indigent
in
order
to
permit
his
counsel
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
district
court
is
wrong?
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
this
policy
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
requiring
counsel
to
come
forward
with
some
assurance
to
the
court
that
they
have
done
a
job
of
investigation.
it
seems
to
me,
it
can
do
nothing
but
to
lead,
to
invite
something
less
than
complete
candidate
for
counsel.
how
can
counsel
in
good
faith
say
that
there's
a
substantial
basis
to
allege
that
there
is
inadequate
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
district
attorney
has
been
unduly
pierced
in
his
attack
upon
the
defendant
if
he
hasn't
read
what
has
been
said?
whose
word
is
he
to
take
of
this?
is
this
the
way
we
expect
lawyers
to
operate?
is
this
the
kind
of
representations
to
the
court
have
a
right
from
expect
from
bar?
i
don't
believe
it
and
i
think
that
to
avoid
what
to
me
is
an
unseemly
business,
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
should
demand
that
lawyers'
function
in
a
way
that
appellate
lawyers
always
function.
by
reading
a
transcript,
they
can
possible
lay
their
hands
on
it
in
making
statements
based
on
fact
instead
of
hypothesis
and
suspicion.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
believe
that
that's
correct
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
can't
answer
that
at
my
own
knowledge.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
you
--
you
are
probably
right.
i
--
i
just
can't
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
what
i
suggest
to
the
court,
congress
really
has
decided.
it's
the
problem
that
mr.
claiborne
would
set
it
large.
congress
has
really
decided
the
defendants
who
can
afford
to
pay
for
transcripts
should
pay
for
it.
and
by
allowing
indigents
to
appeal,
whenever
they
haven't
got
a
frivolous
case,
congress
has
necessarily
decided
by
implication
that
the
government
could
--
should
pay
for
their
transcripts
because
without
it,
we
just
cannot
know
whether
their
case
is
frivolous
or
not.
thank
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you
very
much
(inaudible).
