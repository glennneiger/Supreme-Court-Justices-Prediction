mr.
ratner,
i
suggest
that
(inaudible)
the
fact
of
this
case?
justice

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

if
you
have
gotten
any
case
and
if
you
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
has
also
said
(inaudible)
that
the
right
to
make
reasonable
steps
to
protect
himself
against
those
appeal
of
what

there
was
a

case
for
equal
protection

(inaudible)
justice
john

is
probably

--
justice
john
m.

didn't
he
get

this
case?

the
congress
has
spoken

not
tolerated.
and
therefore,
a
real

is
here,
whether

not
that
limitation
by
congress
is
unconstitutional
or
whether
as
an
exercise
of
supervisory
power.

court

john
