mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
bring
the
case
back
down
to
focus
if
i
may
and
suggest
that
the
question
presented
here
is
how
likely
is
it
that
an
injustice
will
result
in
these
types
of
cases
if
a
complete
transcript
is
not
granted
solely
on
the
allegation
that
the
appellate
counsel
wants
to
search
it
for
error.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
that
likelihood
or
unlikelihood,
it
must
be
weighed
against
the
cost
and
against
the
probability
of
a
wealthy
defendant
obtaining
the
same
transcript
under
the
same
circumstances.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
stretched
over
three
days
though
the
indications
to
me
all
that
it
probably
did
not
take
three
full
days.
for
instance,
the
transcript
of
the
government's
case
which
was
supplied
to
the
petitioner
here
is
only
49
pages
long.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
two
witnesses
so
far
as
i
may
--
could
ascertain
which
would
indicate
perhaps
no
longer
transcript
of
--
is
portion
of
the
evidence.
in
addition
to
which,
the
quests
includes,
however,
wider
examination
of
the
jury,
the
arguments
of
counsel
charged
of
the
judge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
i'm
not
aware
mr.
justice
black.
my
impression
is
that
it
was
taken
stenographically
but
that's
--
i
think
the
odds
would
be
in
that
direction
in
view
of
the
practice
in
the
district
court
in
district
of
columbia.
i
think
it
varies
from
court-to-court,
with
reporter,
from
reporter-to-reporter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
but
as
i
understand
my
opponent's
argument,
however,
he
would
be
satisfied
with
listening
to
a
transcription
that
--
mechanical
transcription,
if
one
had
been
made.
he
would
insist
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no,
it's
correct
sir.
but
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
reflecting
what
manner
of
the
testimony
was
transcribed.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
request
here
for
a
transcript
to
search
for
error
necessarily
means
that
a
transcript
would
be
available,
must
be
made
available
to
every
indigent
in
every
case.
obviously,
if
the
indigent
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
not
be
but
at
least,
it
is
important
i
think,
to
--
to
point
out
that
it's
not
only
those
defendants
who
claim
inability
to
allege
error
and
who
must,
therefore,
have
a
transcript
to
search
for
error,
would
be
entitled
to
a
transcript.
but
surely,
those
who
assign
error,
should
by
the
same
standard
of
equality,
be
entitled
to
the
remaining
transcript
to
search
for
additional
error.
the
notion
that
a
complete
transcript
should
be
made
available
in
every
case
is
clearly
contrary
to
every
decision
on
this
subject
which
this
court
has
rendered
thus
far.
mr.
justice
goldberg
point
out
that
the
draper
decision,
which
i
cite
in
support
of
this
proposition,
involved
the
jurisdiction
which
plain
error
was
not
noticeable.
that,
however,
can
hardly
be
said
to
distinguish
johnson
involving
the
federal
courts
and
coppedge
which
clearly
implies
that
only
--
it
says
--
that
only
such
portions
of
the
transcript
as
are
necessary
to
evaluate
the
claims
actually
made,
need
to
be
finished.
all
of
that
would
have
been
unnecessary
i
suggest
if
a
full
transcript
is
required
in
every
case.
likewise
griffin
versus
illinois
makes
it
clear
that
a
full
transcript
is
not
required
in
every
case.
it
is
also
clearly
contrary
to
the
policy
of
section
1950
to
acquire
a
transcript,
a
full
transcript
in
every
case.
technically,
i
suppose
that
the
granting
of
the
transcript
is
not
the
same
as
the
granting
of
the
appeal.
no
argument
on
that
basis
has
been
made.
however,
the
statute
insofar
as
it
addresses
itself
to
the
question
of
a
record
at
all
seems
to
talk
of
the
record
being
granted
after
the
trans
--
after
the
appeal
has
been
granted.
likewise,
section
753
(e)
of
title
28,
envisages
a
transcript
granted
after
lead
to
appear
in
forma
pauperis.
in
the
court
below,
seemingly
recognizing
the
--
this
problem
uses
the
form
whereby
they
grant
the
appeal
to
the
extent
to
requiring
the
government
to
furnish
such
and
such
portion
of
the
transcript
in
this
case,
the
whole
of
the
government's
evidence.
the
most
important
hurdle
to
overcome
it
seems
to
me
in
section
1915
is
the
prohibition
on
appeals
in
forma
pauperis
where
the
trial
judge
has
certified
that
the
appeal
is
frivolous
and
not
taken
in
good
faith.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
at
--
not
in
all
cases,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
if
it
were,
i
don't
think
government
would
make
any
argument
about
making
available
their
copy
or
a
carbon
copy
to
the
--
to
the
indigent.
that
government
itself,
sometimes
later
on
at
the
appellate
petition
stage
may
for
its
own
information
required
a
transcript
which
in
forma
pauperis
cases,
it
usually
files
in
this
court
for
instance,
an
opposition
to
petition.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
logic
cases.
but
i
don't
think
your
honor
in
the
case
of
this
sought
which
took
two
or
three
days
if
there
would
be
any
--
reform
any
useful
purpose
to
be
said
by
daily
transcript.
nor
do
i
think
that
the
defense
attorney,
even
with
all
of
his
clients'
funds
that
is
disposal
would
require
a
daily
transcript
in
this
sort
of
short
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
he
is,
of
course,
free
to
interview
trial
counsel,
his
own
client,
the
judge,
the
court
reporter
and
he
may
be
able
to
under
some
circumstances,
have
the
court
reporter
read
back
to
it
in
the
transcript
the
notes
or
the
stenographic
recording
if
there
had
been
one.
i
know
of
no
such
common
practice,
take
it
in
this
case,
no
such
request
was
made
and
the
argument
made
to
your
honors
about
the
petitioner
is
that
that
alternative
would
be
inadequate
in
any
event.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
can
only
say
to
your
honor
that
there
is
no
statutory
provision
one
way
or
the
other,
that
to
my
knowledge,
a
court
reporter
has
not
refused
to
accommodate
the
attorney
for
an
indigent
when
such
request
was
made,
but
i'm
frank
to
say
that
i
don't
know
how
often
such
request
has
been
made.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
justified
assumption
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
must
remember
that
we're
dealing
with
an
unusual
case
in
which
counsel
after
the
interviews
which
he
would
undertake
in
any
event
that
is
an
interview
of
his
own
client
and
of
the
trial
attorney,
i
presume
he
would
do
that
with
or
without
a
transcript,
still
can
make
no
allegation
of
error
which
he
himself
can
label
as
non-frivolous.
now,
at
that
point,
it
is
not
likely
especially
in
the
face
of
the
certificate
from
the
trial
judge
that
there
is
so-called
hidden
error.
and
perhaps,
i
should
suggest
that
plain
error
rule
is
not
fully
applicable
here.
rule
52
(b)
covers
errors
which
are
not
timely
noticed
but
which
may
very
well
in
the
memory
of
the
trial
attorney
come
to
his
mind.
he
may
remember
that
he
should've
objected
at
one
point
when
he
didn't
and
the
plain
error
rule
will
protect
him
but
it's
not
necessary
that
he
referred
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
--
at
once,
he
has
made
that
assignment
of
error
your
honor.
he
will
be
furnished
a
transcript
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
without
opposition
from
the
government
and
under
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
at
least
in
the
ingram
case,
his
allegation
no
matter
how
conclusory,
no
matter
how
unsupported,
provided
it
is
a
specific
allegation
of
error
will
earn
him
so
much
of
the
transcript
as
is
necessary
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
to
dispose
of
their
claim.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
this
very
case,
the
petitioner
said
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
to
the
government's
evidence
on
the
claim
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
which
normally
would
be
tested
out
for
the
government's
proof.
he
did
not
come
back
and
say,
this
is
insufficient
for
me
to
judge
the
substantial
--
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i've
--
i
should
say
to
say
to
your
honor
that
the
present
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
under
the
ingram
decision,
is
to
assign
counsel
and
to
furnish
at
the
one
and
the
same
time
such
portions
of
the
transcript
as
seem
necessary
to
evaluate
the
pro
se
claims
of
error
made
by
the
indigent
which
normally
or
often
includes
one
of
insufficiency
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
that
point,
counsel
is
then
free
to
--
as
traditional
transcript,
if
he
can
in
good
faith,
make
additional
claims
of
error
based
on
his
investigation
or
based
on
his
examination
of
the
question
that
has
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
--
this
case
is
decided
before
this
new
practice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
nevertheless,
counsel
initially
suggested
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
had
the
petitioner
on
that
basis
he
was
given
a
transcript
to
the
government's
evidence.
he
then
returned
to
the
court
and
said,
on
that
basis
of
my
examination
of
this
transcript,
on
the
basis
of
my
interview
of
trial
counsel
and
of
my
client,
i
can
make
no
claim
of
error
whatever,
in
effect
of
abandoning
his
claim
of
insufficiency
of
evidence.
but,
there
may
well
be
some
plain
error
which
a
full
transcript
would
disclose.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
point
out
that
he
did
not
exhaust
the
investigation
which
he
might
have
undertaken.
no
indication
that
he
approached
the
court
reporter
of
--
or
the
judge
or
any
witness
in
the
case,
nor
did
he
furnish
the
court
of
appeal
with
any
summary
of
the
cases
he
had
been
able
to
reconstruct
it
from
the
infuse
he
did
conclude,
leaving
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
position
of
having
to
rule
abstractly
as
this
court
perhaps
is
forced
to
rule
abstractly
whether
in
any
case,
it
is
sufficient
to
say,
“i
want
a
transcript
to
search
for
error.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
concede
your
honor
that
it
is
a
burden
on
appointed
counsel
to
make
this
investigation.
i
would
suggest
that
in
a
great
many
cases,
a
conclusory
allegation
of
error
can
be
made
without
exhausting
all
available
avenues
and
the
court
does
not
require
counsel
to
exhaust
all
other
investigation.
if
he
can
on
the
basis
of
one
interview,
say
i
have
good
cause
to
believe
that
the
evidence
may
have
been
insufficient,
the
court
will
promptly
grant
him
transcript
to
at
least
the
government's
evidence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
i
--
here
in
a
sense
more
on
behalf
of
congress
so
the
department
of
the
treasury
then
the
department
of
justice.
a
point
of
view
of
the
department
of
justice,
it
might
be
most
desirable
to
have
a
transcript
in
every
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
also
the
government's
benefit
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
indigent,
and
it
would
spare
the
government
the
need
of
filing
oppositions
to
motions
believe
to
have
a
transcript
of
leave
to
appeal.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
it
is
i
understand
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia,
a
practice
initiated
by
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
a
practice
initiated
by
the
united
states
attorney
not
to
oppose
the
granting
of
a
complete
transcript
in
any
case
in
which
the
cost
thereof
would
not
exceed
$200
which
is
a
practical
matter
and
usually
it
means,
any
case
tried
in
less
than
three
days
--
in
three
days
or
less.
the
court
i
understand
inevitably
grants
such
a
transcript
upon
the
government's
failure
to
object.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
must
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
there
is
no
basis
in
terms
of
equality
for
distinguishing
between
the
short
trial
and
the
long
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
simply
that
we
do
the
best
we
can
now.
it
has
been
determined
that
in
terms
of
cost
to
the
government,
it
is
no
more
expensive
to
have
the
transcript
prepared
than
to
file
the
opposition
and
waste
the
time
of
the
government
attorneys
and
of
the
court
in
judging
this
motion
without
the
benefit
of
the
transcript.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
any
impropriety
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
their
procedure
informal
as
it
is,
is
authorized
by
the
statute.
i
agree
that
the
statue
makes
no
distinction
between
expensive
and
cheap
transcripts
and
therefore
--
or
perhaps
if
it
were
a
question
of
the
government's
taking
any
active
role
in
furnishing
a
transcript
in
one
case
or
the
other,
it
would
be
improper.
all
they
actually
do
is
not
file
an
opposition
and
the
court,
by
its
order,
tested
understanding
i
suppose
grants
the
transcript
in
those
cases,
on
the
ground
that
their
cost
factor
is
no
longer
an
important
element
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you
--
you're
quite
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
the
explanation
is
that
the
practice
is
--
came
after
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
case
in
fact
in
many
respects,
is
the
very
strange
animal.
it
could
not
occur
today
under
the
practice
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
precisely
the
disposition
which
the
government
has
suggested.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
suggest
that
on
remand,
the
transcript
would
necessarily
be
granted.
the
court
in
the
ingram
case
itself,
in
which
it
announced
the
new
rules
said,
this
is
for
the
future
and
now
as
to
the
cases
in
the
past,
we
must
require
counsel
to
make
some
claim
of
error.
that
never
happens
today
because
the
indigent
pro
se
makes
some
claim
of
error
before
his
counsel
has
a
chance
to
disavowing
and
therefore,
he
gets
some
transcripts.
under
the
new
practice,
this
result
had
been
happened.
i
will
say,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
we
do
feel
it
necessary
for
the
court
to
determine
before
remanding
this
case
that
it
should
agree
with
us,
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
a
complete
transcript
in
every
case,
merely
to
search
for
error.
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
petition
on
that
proposition,
there
would
be
no
purpose
served
in
remanding
the
case.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
which
was
transcribed
and
was
made
available
before
trial
to
the
petitioner
and
he's
then
--
his
trial
counsel.
we
reproduced
in
appendix
to
our
brief
the
indictment
and
the
judgments.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
wouldn't
think
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
would
be
justification
for
such
a
rule
where
appellate
counsel
is
--
where
a
trial
counsel
is
freely
available
to
appellate
counsel.
if
any
error
--
well,
let
me
put
it
the
other
way,
if
the
trial
counsel
is
unavailable,
then
there
is
reason
to
afford
appellate
counsel
another
method
of
learning
something
informative
about
the
trial
from
someone
who
was
in
position
because
a
lawyer
to
appraise
it
properly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
such
as
the
transcript
and
then
the
court
of
appeal
has
recognized
that
in
a
case
where
trial
counsel
had
died,
the
united
states
attorney
who
is
normally
consulted
had
left
government
service,
then
the
court
realized
that
the
only
practical
way
for
appellate
counsel
to
do
his
job
was
on
a
full
transcript
which
the
court
did
order.
but
in
very
ingram
case,
the
case
which
follows
this
one
and
the
light
of
which
we
suggest
this
case
should
be
remanded,
the
court
distinguished
between
that
unusual
situation
where
trial
counsel
is
no
longer
available
and
the
normal
situation
where
he
can
be
consulted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
--
i
must
submit
that
i
have
not
researched
it.
i
think
i
should
point
out
in
conclusion
that
there
is
a
realistic
chance
that
by
granting
a
transcript
to
every
indigent
defendant,
whom
is
unable
to
make
any
claim
of
error
despite
consultation
with
his
client
and
with
trial
counsel,
and
in
the
face
of
a
certificate
of
frivolity
by
the
trial
judge
will
be
given
more
than
the
moneyed
defendant.
that
chance
seems
to
me,
at
least
equal
to
the
chance
of
an
injustice
resulting
from
the
denial
of
transcript
under
these
unusual
circumstances.
in
the
best
of
all
possible
wills,
everyone,
rich
and
poor,
would
be
given
a
free
transcript
but
no
one
has
suggested
that
nor
would
that
be
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
possible
under
the
existing
statutes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
that
might
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
a
truly
equal
rule.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
there
is
a
difference
between
that
rule
which
treats
everyone
alike,
truly
treats
everyone
alike
and
the
rule
which
requires
the
man
with
money
who
is
unable
to
make
the
affidavit
of
poverty
to
weigh
the
--
how
worthwhile
it
is
to
pay
for
a
transcript.
he
may
well
decide
unless
his
sentence
is
severe
or
unless
his
attorney
advises
him
that
there's
some
real
point
in
appeal
not
to
buy
transcript
merely
on
the
hope
that
some
error
will
be
found
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suggest
your
honor
that
it
does
not
fully
answer
the
question
to
say
that
indigent
appeals
are
not
frivolous.
certainly,
there
have
been
many
indigent
appeals
which
are
well-taken.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i
think
your
honor
had
it
any
criminal
penalty
or
severe
criminal
penalty
as
opposed
to
a
light
one.
and
that
would
get
in
--
get
us
into
another
problem
whether
there
was
any
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
man
who
had
a
10-year
sentence
to
the
man
who
only
had
a
two-year
sentence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
court
would
insist
on
counsel's
giving
the
court
a
little
more
information.
if
he
gave
the
court
more
information
about
the
case
and
still
insisted
that
he
was
unable
to
discover
any
basis
for
error,
having
already
received
the
government's
evidence,
i
think
the
court
might
well
deny
any
further
transcript,
and
ultimately
might
well
deny
the
appeal
after
looking
at
the
government's
transcript.
on
the
other
hand,
that
decision,
ingram
was
a
two
to
three
decision
--
a
two
to
one
decision.
dissenting
view
was
that
the
new
rule
should
be
applied
retrospectively
and
that
view
may
very
well
prevail
on
the
remand
of
this
case.
in
which
event,
since
the
petitioner
pro
se
made
sufficient
allegations
to
require
in
the
entire
transcript,
he
would
receive
an
entire
transcript.
i
can't
confidently
predict
what
would
happen
in
the
court
of
appeal.
one
question
i
think,
i
should
in
or
kindly
advise
the
court
as
to
the
cost
of
indigent
transcripts,
it
has
gone
up
very
measurably
from
--
in
1960,
the
administrative
office
advises
me
the
cost
of
the
transcripts
in
criminal
cases
to
indigents
criminal
cases
involving
united
states
of
course
74,500,
last
year,
fiscal
1963,
$145,000.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
a
nationwide.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
to
that
must
be
added
the
cost
of
printing
joint
appendix
of
the
cost
are
involved
in
processing
these
appeals
but
the
cost
of
joint
appendix
would
not
exceed
about
$20,000
under
--
assuming
the
number
of
appeals
provided
here.
this
has
nothing
for
the
cost
of
a
program
which
would
allow
every
case
be
prosecuted
with
a
full
transcript.
