mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
did
this
case
take
to
trials,
you
know
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
know
how
long
this
trial
took
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
49
pages.
did
the
defendant
put
in
much
of
a
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne,
under
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia,
is
there
any
alternative
procedure
by
which
a
--
an
appointed
counsel
for
an
indigent
and
perhaps
ignorant
defendant
might
be
able
to
--
to
determine
whether
there
is
hidden
error
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
your
--
do
the
appointed
counsel
for
these
defendants
had
the
right
to
demand
to
the
court
reporter
that
he
takes
his
time
to
read
back
the
transcript
in
each
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
probably
that's
not
made
because
it
can't
be
obtained.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
possible?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
talk
a
little
louder
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
seem
fair
to
put
a
price
tag
on
--
on
these
things
--
on
these
transcripts
and
say
that
if
a
--
if
a
defendant
has
a
short
trial,
it
only
takes
a
day
or
two
where
there's
perhaps
little
opportunity
for
air,
if
he's
entitled
to
a
transcript
or
that
if
he
has
a
rather
long,
hard-fought
trial
where
error
often
is
committed?
if
it
is
committed,
that
he's
not
entitled
to
the
same
thing,
is
that
--
do
that
seem
reasonable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
they
do
it
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
has
congress
intimated
that
in
the
long,
hard-fought
trial,
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
--
to
less
protection
than
he
is
in
a
--
in
a
short
probably,
very
simple
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
not
be
put
in
the
stamp
of
approval
on
what
you,
yourself
have
said,
is
not
a
fair
differentiation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
has
been
done
in
my
state
for
over
50
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
my
own
personal
knowledge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
in
bankrupted
of
the
state
either.
i
doubt
--
i
doubt
if
we
have
many
more
appeals
in
california
than
they
have
in
other
jurisdictions
that
supply
no
transcript
when
they
can
get
out
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ratner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ratner,
i
understand
you're
reported
by
the
court
below
to
represent
this
indigent
--
indigent
appellant
and
you
represented
him
there
and
here
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
court
appreciates
that
kind
of
service
on
the
part
of
employers.
it's
a
public
service
and
one
must
--
well-done.
we
thank
you
very
much.
and
mr.
claiborne,
i
thank
you
for
your
very
fair,
frank
representation
of
the
government
in
this
case.
