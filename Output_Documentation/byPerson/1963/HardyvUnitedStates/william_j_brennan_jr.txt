justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
arguing
this
mr.
ratner
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
appreciate
it
what
i'm
getting
to,
whether
eliminating
this
to
a
constitutional
argument
or
also
appealing
to
the
supervisor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
ratner,
there
was
no
en
banc
consideration
of
this
on
the
circuit,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
application
made
for
en
banc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
this
is
--
at
least
a
part
isn't
rather
a
local
administrative
matter
that
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
whether
there
was
panel
determination
necessarily
should
be
just
positive,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
can
appreciate
that
it
is
on
the
constitutional
arguments
you're
making
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
rule
is,
it
ought
to
be
a
common
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
an
argument
then
mr.
ratner
but
it's
not
necessary
that
they'd
be
asserted,
the
grounds
solvents
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
argument
that
you
can't
even
assert
that
ground
until
you
look
at
the
whole
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
don't
know
whether
dollars
are
necessarily
a
relevant
consideration
here
but
if
you
get
any
idea
that
this
would
run
into
dollar?
was
there
anybody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
we
really
ask
a
lot
of
non-compensative
counsel,
don't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
i'll
put
on
in
the
burden
of
going
around
and
interviewing
everybody
and
move
the
transcript,
it
didn't
strike
me
as
the
soundest
argument
you
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
what
happens?
suppose
--
suppose
he's
got
all
through
this
interview
process
after
talking
with
the
defendant,
the
witnesses,
the
judge
and
court
reporter,
he
concludes
that
there's
a
serious
question
whether
the
government
had
presented
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
conviction.
he
makes
that
assignment
of
error.
how
does
he
support
it
on
the
appeal
without
a
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
automatically?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
of
--
as
of
the
government's
evidence.
government
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask,
is
the
practice
and
factors
that
if
counsel
with
or
without
interviews,
assigns
as
a
ground
of
appearance,
sufficiency
of
evidence
automatically
without
further
inquiry.
he
gets
a
transcript
to
the
government's
proof?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
usually
says,
â€œi
wasn't
guilty."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
that
carries
with
it
the
legal
jargon,
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
convict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
to
the
situation
in
this
case
presents
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
description
of
evidence
or
overzealousness
by
the
prosecutor
or
erroneous
charge
or
something
like
that,
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
qualify
within
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
here
that
as
--
as
report
of
the
mr.
clark
committee,
a
transcript
of
a
three-day
trial
will
generally
cost
less
than
$200
to
prepare
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
thought
--
you
thought
this
trial
probably
did
not
take
three-full
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see,
this
new
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
we
send
it
back
to
the
district
and
we
consider
and
let
it
the
practice
that
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
didn't
notice
that.
i
mean
if
(inaudible)
probably
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
certainly,
there's
pending
legislation
on
providing
trial
counsel,
as
i
recall
it
has
provisions
of
one
kind
or
another
for
the
expenses
of
discovery
of
discovering
that
sort
of
--
i
take
it
at
that
legislation
has
nothing
in
it
which
bears
on
our
problem,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
district
only?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nationwide.
