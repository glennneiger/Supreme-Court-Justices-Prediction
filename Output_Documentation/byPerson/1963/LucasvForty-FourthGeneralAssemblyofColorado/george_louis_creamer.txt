mr.
george
louis
creamer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
instinct
case
is
a
case
which
arises
with
reference
to
state
legislative
apportionment
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
follows
a
succession
of
some
six
cases
which
i
believe
the
court
heard
in
november
this
year
in
a
series
of
arguments
then.
in
order
to
explain
the
problem
so
that
it
is
coherent,
it
perhaps
would
be
well
to
explain
briefly
the
history
of
apportionment
in
colorado
and
the
history
of
this
particular
case
judicially.
colorado
has
the
convenience
of
an
almost
finite
starting
point
in
history
which
is
its
starting
point
in
apportionment
as
well.
it
was
first,
for
all
practical
purposes
established
in
1859
by
the
discovery
of
gold
along
three
creek
systems
in
the
near
vicinity
of
denver.
the
backwash
of
the
colorado,
the
california
gold
rush
populated
it
quite
rapidly
with
the
allure
of
that
metal.
it
existed
almost
non-governmentally
from
1859
to
1861,
but
in
1861
there
was
passed
a
territorial
statute,
creating
a
territory
of
colorado
out
of
what
had
previously
been
the
territories
or
portions
of
the
territories
of
kansas,
nebraska,
new
mexico
and
utah.
when
the
state
or
the
territory
was
first
created,
there
was
created
a
legislative
council
under
the
territorial
act.
the
legislative
council
consisted
of
two
houses.
those
two
houses
were
a
council
and
an
assembly,
very
much
in
parallel
to
the
present
house
of
representatives
and
the
present
senate
which
constitute
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
colorado.
the
first
body,
the
smaller,
the
council,
was
described
or
prescribed
to
consist
of
from
9
to
13
members,
and
the
second
body
from
13
to
26
members
to
be
selected
upon
the
basis
of
an
apportionment
on
population
as
nearly
equal
as
maybe,
that
phrase
is
nearly
as
maybe,
occurring
in
the
document
itself.
the
units
which
were
used
were
a
system
of
divisions
which
closely
approximated
to
our
original
county
divisions,
the
state
being
as
a
territory
identical
with
the
present
state
boundaries,
but
being
divided
into
fewer
than
a
dozen
county
units,
each
obviously
of
rather
monumental
physical
size
for
that
particular
period.
the
civil
war
intervened
in
development
of
the
state
further
and
immediately
after
the
civil
war,
in
1866
there
was
enacted
by
the
congress
and
steps
were
taken
pursuant
to
it
by
the
people
of
colorado,
an
enabling
act
to
permit
the
organization
of
the
state
of
colorado.
president
johnson
vetoed
that
act
for
reasons
--
the
nature
of
which
i
do
not
historically
remember,
but
don't
bear
particularly
on
apportionment
in
any
case.
following
the
veto
of
the
act
and
until
the
year
1874,
the
state
continued
in
the
same
territorial
fashion.
in
1874
congress
enacted
an
enabling
act
and
by
1876
the
state
was
established
as
a
state
and
obtained
its
name,
a
sentential
state
for
that
reason.
it
continued
under
a
constitution,
legislatively
in
much
the
same
fashion
that
it
had
existed
in
the
territorial
scheme
of
things.
it
had
house
of
representatives
and
it
had
the
senate.
these
initially
were
distributed,
the
constitution
sets
out
the
districts,
in
roughly
or
set
out
the
districts,
they
have
been
repealed
since
the
first
constitution
did,
set
out
the
districts
essentially
in
the
same
manner
the
old
council
and
house
districts
had
been
set
out
theretofore,
established
on
a
population
basis
primarily.
there
were
three
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes,
the
constitution
didn't
require
it
on
a
population
basis.
i
am
just
reaching
that
point.
the
constitution
had
in
article
5,
sections
45,
46
and
47,
a
provision
on
the
method
in
which
there
was
to
be
apportionment
thereafter
if
used
the
initial
districts
essentially
as
they
have
existed
territorially
and
those
were
population
based.
but
then
in
section
45
it
said
essentially,
page
6
of
the
memo
contains
the
--
our
brief
contains
the
section,
that
the
general
assembly
provided
by
law
--
shall
provide
by
law
an
enumeration
of
inhabitance
of
the
state
in
the
year
of
our
law
1885
and
decennially
there
after.
it
provided
also
that
every,
at
the
session
next
following
that
enumeration,
that
is
the
state
decennial
enumeration
which
takes
place
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
decennium
rather
than
in
the
first
year
as
the
federal
one
does,
after
that
enumeration
and
after
each
federal
apportionment,
federal
enumeration
as
well,
federal
censes,
there
must
be
an
enumeration
of
the
senate
at
the
next
session
following
enumeration
made
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
revise
and
adjust
the
apportionment
for
senators
and
representatives
on
the
basis
of
such
enumeration
according
to
ratios
to
be
fixed
by
law.
so
that
we
were
supposed
to
have
an
apportionment
in
accordance
with
population
every
five
years
according
to
the
scheme
the
constitution
sets
out.
this
scheme
is
rather
remarkable
among
american
constitutional
schemes
in
that
it
has
been
entirely
ignored
from
its
beginning.
there
has
never
been
a
state
censes
in
colorado,
nobody
ever
took
one
and
therefore
there
has
not
been
an
enumeration
every
five
years
because
the
wherewithal
every
five
year
enumeration
simply
did
not
exist.
there
have
been
gestures
towards
enumeration
or
reapportionment
made
every
ten
years,
when
someone
didn't
forget.
there
was
one
done
in
1880
but
that
was
before
the
1885
provision
was
first
in
effect.
there
was
one
done
in
1901,
there
was
one
done
approximately
1920.
there
were
two
of
them
done
in
the
30s.
there
was
one
of
them
done
in
approximately
1955.
those
in
the
30s
led
to
a
miserable
(inaudible).
the
legislature
viewing
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
marked
population
departure
from
the
mountains
towards
the
plains
area
did
reapportion
and
had
in
mind
exactly
what
no
one
knows
but
it
followed,
its
reapportionment
followed
a
popularly
initiated
reapportionment
which
was
violently
in
conflict
with
it.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
colorado
pointed
out
in
that
case
that
the
legislative
apportionment
was
almost
certainly
unconstitutional
because
it
gave
to
areas
not
entitled
to
representatives,
representatives
entitled
on
a
population
basis
that
was
the
basis
the
court
indicated
and
otherwise
it
breached
the
matter
generally.
the
1955
reapportionment
which
was
the
only
one
really
to
attempt
to
be
done
after
the
1930s
did
nothing
effectively.
it
changed
denver
by
one
representative.
it
made
almost
no
changes
in
the
senate
and
it
accomplished
no
change
where
they
have
mentioned
except
that
it
possibly
was
a
gesture
of
good
faith
towards
the
principle
at
least
it
was
attempted
to
be.
the
legislature,
before
they
met
only
every
two
years
in
any
kind
of
plenary
session.
it
now
meets
once
a
year,
but
it's
sessions
in
the
even
numbered
year
are
limited
to
budgetary
matters
and
such
matters
as
the
governor
places
before
it,
particularly
in
his
call.
however,
following
the
1960
census,
the
legislature
was
in
session.
it
was
in
session
at
the
time
1960
census
was
prepared
and
it
was
in
session
the
following
year.
at
each
of
these
calls
the
governor
did
mention
to
the
assembly
the
fact
of
the
census
and
transmitted
to
it
copies
of
the
document
which
we
have
filed
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief,
the
census
tracked,
but
nothing
was
done
about
apportionment,
absolutely
nothing.
now
at
this
stage,
some
litigation
was
instituted
by
parties
other
than
those
now
before
the
court
before
the
colorado
supreme
court
asking
that
it
take
action.
those
decisions
have
no
direct
relation
to
the
proceeding
here,
but
should
historically
be
mentioned.
the
colorado
supreme
court
recognized
that
apportionment
was
in
some
what
historic
case
within
the
state.
there
was
a
marked
split
in
the
court
on
the
point.
all
of
it
agreed
that
some
of
the
apportionment
was
necessary,
portion
of
it
did
not
mention,
the
majority,
did
not
mention
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
all.
it
overlooked
that
point
rather
pronouncedly
and
it
simply
said
that
it
would
wait
and
see
what
the
legislature
did.
it
didn't
do
anything
and
then
the
remainder
of
the
court
in
quite
vigorous
terms
denounced
the
whole
situation
as
a
violent
departure
from
the
criterion
required
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
since
nothing
had
been
done
action
was
instituted
by
a
group
of
some
15
or
16
persons,
residents
of
the
counties
of
denver,
adams
jefferson,
and
arapahoe
immediately
surrounding
denver
which
are
worst
discriminated
areas
though
there
are
others
as
we
point
out
that
are
very
bad.
in
the
district
court,
the
court
pursuant
to
request
convolved
the
statutory
court
of
three
judges
and
that
court
commenced
hearings
in
the
matter.
the
first
of
those
hearings
took
place
in
1962.
at
that
time
the
situation
was
as
we
described
it.
the
last
attempted
reapportionment
had
been
in
1953,
the
last
actual
one
in
1930
and
the
situation
existed
in
the
state
of
distortion
such
that
the
smallest
county
huerfano,
perhaps
appropriately
named
since
it
means
the
orphan,
but
in
this
case
a
well
treated
orphan,
huerfano
with
population
of
7000
persons
had
one
representative
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
jefferson
county
with
a
127,000
persons
had
one
representative
also.
there
existed
in
the
senate
a
similar
kind
of
situation.
the
least
populous
county
was
represented,
had
a
senator
representing
18000
persons,
a
few
over
18000
and
the
most
populous
county
for
unit
of
senator,
one
representing
a
127,000,
again
in
each
case
better
than
nine
to
one
discrimination
and
singularly
unfortunate.
in
that
case,
the
attorney
general
appeared
to
represent
the
assembly
of
colorado
and
then
principle
offices
of
state
who
were
the
defendants
in
an
injunctive
action,
the
parties
have
since
been
changed
slightly
by
the
rules
on
the
substitution
because
other
officers
have
succeeded
but
that
was
taken
care
of
simply
by
administrative
order
of
court
and
is
not
a
problem
here.
the
persons
were
also
allowed
to
intervene
who
were
at
the
time
sponsoring
one
of
two
proposed
constitutional
amendments.
one
of
those
proposed
constitutional
amendments
is
known
as
amendment
number
seven
and
is
constantly
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here
under
that
name
because
we
have
no
other
method
in
colorado
of
naming
them,
they
are
just
the
numberings
or
ballot
positions
in
a
particular
election,
but
it's
the
only
reference
that
exists
whereby
it
can
be
referred
to.
there
was
another
measure,
amendment
number
eight
proposing
a
somewhat
different
mode
of
reapportionment.
it
should
be
mentioned
here
that
in
the
colorado
scheme
of
things
on
constitution
they
referred
matters
or
other
referred
matters
one
measure
does
not
run
against
another
measure.
everyone
votes
on
each
measure
and
each
measure
must
be
enacted
and
become
a
possible
constitution
if
it
receives
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
upon
that
measure.
so
that
if
there
would
be
two
confliction
measures,
there
is
question
of
considerable
intricacy
as
to
what
would
happen
but
fortunately
that
did
not
happen.
it
only
became
a
conjecture
of
question.
at
any
rate
the
interventions
were
allowed
on
behalf
of
mr.
johnson
and
others
who
were
sponsors
of
the
measure
amendment
number
seven
and
they
participated
throughout
the
trials
in
the
matter.
at
the
end
of
the
initial
hearings
the
statutory
court
took
the
matter
under
advisement
and
it
rendered
a
per
curiam
opinion
which
we
have
referred
to
as
the
memorandum
opinion
which
is
reprinted
i
believe
at
the
end
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
its
entirety
and
which
appears
in
208
federal
supplement,
they
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
in
that
opinion
the
court
held
that
the
colorado
apportionment
was
completely
unconstitutional
as
it
existed
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
it
and
that
the
testimony
which
included
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
proponents
of
amendment
number
seven
did
not
constitute
a
basis
upon
which
the
existing
apportionment
could
be
upheld.
the
court
rendered
its
opinion,
however,
as
i
recall
it
made
later
part
of
august
of
the
year
and
it
pointed
out
with
several
problems
existed.
first
there
was
an
impending
election;
second
there
was
extremely
little
time
before
that
election,
and
third,
it
did
not
then
know
what
the
result
of
the
election
might
be.
so
though
it
declared
the
scheme
as
it
existed
to
be
unconstitutional
it
stated
that
it
would
abide
the
result
of
the
election
then
hold
further
conferences
and
hold
further
hearings
dependent
on
what
might
have
occurred.
what
did
occur
was
that
the
measure
denominated
number
seven
was
adopted.
now,
that
is
set
out
also
fully
textually
in
the
introductory
portion
of
the
brief
particularly
on
page
seven
and
following.
it
amends
in
their
entirety
sections
45,
46,
and
47
of
the
article
5
of
the
constitution,
the
sections
i
had
referred
to
before
is
having
existed
from
1876
onward.
it
amends
them
in
several
particulars.
the
house
of
representatives,
as
it
had
existed
last
before
amendment
consisted
of
65
members.
the
senate
consisted
of
35
members.
it
was
provided
that
these
members
were
to
be
elected
from
districts
which
might
be
altered
from
time
to
time
as
public
convenience
might
require,
but
that
they
must
be
composed
of
four
counties
adjacent
physically
and
that
no
county
might
be
divided
in
the
creation
of
senatorial
districts
or
house,
there
could
be
a
house
district,
no
they
couldn't
pardon
they
couldn't
be
divided
at
all.
now
this
resulted
in
somewhat
an
inconvenience
which
has
nothing
much
to
do
with
the
matter
before
the
court.
in
the
election
from
a
district
such
as
the
city
and
county
of
denver
in
which
there
are
17
representatives
and
the
17
representatives
must
be
elected
at
large
because
under
the
old
constitution
that
could
not
be
representative
districts
within
the
county,
so
persons
have
to
bear
in
mind
in
vote
among
34
candidates
and
this
is
something
of
a
feat
of
memory
if
nothing
else,
this
was
altered
by
the
new
amendment.
the
new
amendment
added,
essentially
did
this;
it
left
the
house
at
65
members.
it
provided
that
the
65
members
the
house
of
representatives
must
be
apportioned
as
nearly
on
the
basis
of
population
as
maybe
that
is
from
district
is
nearly
equal
in
population
as
maybe.
there
is
no
objection
obviously
constitutionally
capable
of
being
raised
to
such
a
situation
possibly
there
was
none
under
the
old
formulae
expect
the
failure
to
apportion
it,
it
was
not
he
constitution
that
was
defective
but
the
practice
of
not
putting
it
into
operation.
under
the
old
system
we
used
a
weighted
ratio
basis
in
which
we
gave
19,000
persons
for
the
first
senator
and
a
representative
and
8,000
persons
for
the
first
senator
and
then
it
took
a
fraction
up
to
48,000
to
get
another
representative
and
a
monumental
fraction
to
get
another
senator
and
so
forth.
the
whole
idea
being
that
as
the
represented
area
grew
larger
the
possibility
which
having
representation
grew
smaller,
that
being
the
entire
purpose
well
carried
out
for
many
years
of
the
system
and
it
resulted
in
a
rural
based
legislature
entirely.
the
new
system
requires
that
the
house
be
on
a
basis
of
single
member
districts
as
nearly
equal
in
population
as
maybe
and
it
prescribes
a
method
of
contiguity
of
districting,
and
it
is
not
involved
here.
the
senate
is
quite
another
problem.
the
senate
provides
that
there
be
an
increase
in
the
number
of
senators
from
35
to
39
for
additional
ones.
one
of
these
additional
senators
is
given
to
the
county
of
boulder,
one
is
given
to
the
county
of
adams,
one
to
jefferson
and
one
to
arapahoe.
the
counties
of
boulder,
adams,
jefferson
and
arapahoe
are
in
the
near
vicinity
of
denver.
adams,
jefferson,
and
arapahoe
county
form
a
doughnut
as
i
believe
the
solicitor
produced
a
map,
shortly
before
the
hearing
and
i
take
it,
it
has
been
distributed
to
the
court,
it's
a
very
good
map
and
it
is
perhaps
futile
to
observe
some
of
these
things,
one
tends
to
assume
a
greater
knowledge
of
colorado
geography
and
non-coloradoans
for
various
reasons
and
it
perhaps
is
easier
to
visualize
from
the
map.
but
at
any
rate
adams,
jefferson
and
arapahoe
are
in
a
doughnut
immediately
around
denver
and
boulder
is
a
county
slightly
to
the
north
of
these,
but
for
all
practical
purposes
because
of
the
highway
linkage
and
the
state
university
situation
and
the
population
growth
trend
it's
in
the
immediate
denver
metropolitan
area
and
is
so
considered
in
census
track
designations
at
the
present
time.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes,
they
are
really
sort
of
schizophrenic
in
character.
about
four-and-a-half
to
five
miles
in
depth
of
them
is
typical
suburbia,
heavily
populated
and
for
all
purposes
indistinguishable
from
denver
except
that
an
artificial
boundary
line
exists
somewhere.
then
the
balance
of
them
become
very
large
territorial
areas
which
are
agrarian
in
the
case
of
adams
and
arapahoe
and
which
are
mountainous
in
the
case
of
jefferson,
because
jefferson
begins
to
move
over
into
the
mountain
ranges
themselves.
the
population
is
explosive
in
those
areas.
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
because
it's
the
basic
statistical
problem
here,
that
colorado
in
the
decennium
1950
to
1960
increased
33
and
a
fraction
percent
in
total
population,
but
while
it
increased
33
and
a
fraction
percent
in
population,
it's
rural
areas
decreased
actually
by
6%
in
gross
population,
it's
urban
areas
increased
by
55%.
now
not
only
did
it's
urban
areas
increased
by
55%,
but
the
increase
was
not
in
the
city
and
county
of
denver,
the
great
urban
area
which
increased
only
18%,
but
was
primarily
in
adams,
jefferson
and
arapahoe
counties.
adams
has
the
curious
distinction
of
being
next
to
tokyo
the
most
rapidly
growing
area
in
the
world.
it
increased
199%
in
the
decennium
in
population
and
arapahoe
120
--
no
117%
and
jefferson
127%.
so
these
are
very
rapidly
growing
areas
indeed.
they
have
now
approximated
350,000
to
360,000
persons
in
the
three
counties
which
is
very
nearly
the
population
of
big
city
in
county
of
denver
itself.
boulder
is
growing
quite
rapidly
as
well,
but
not
nearly
at
the
same
rate
the
others
are.
there
are
two
other
urban
areas
in
the
state.
one
of
them
is
the
area
surrounding
the
city
of
colorado
springs
in
el
paso
county
to
the
south,
and
the
other
south
of
that
the
city
of
pueblo
which
is
growing
less
rapidly
but
is
a
major
urban
area.
as
will
be
noted
this
pattern
of
population
follows
in
a
line
from
boulder
on
the
north
to
pueblo
on
the
south
and
it
follows
almost
directly
along
the
corridor
of
the
mountains
along
the
east
footings
of
the
mountains
in
a
very
long
narrow
strip.
now
what
has
happened
in
the
decennium
is
typical
of
what
has
happened
in
the
century
within
the
state.
the
population
of
the
state
initially
was
primarily
centered
at
the
confluence
of
the
passing
cherry
creek
which
is
denver
and
was
one
of
the
gold
sites
and
it
developed
into
a
large
city
rather
initially,
but
then
the
prime
populations
were
centered
in
the
mountain
gold
caps,
places
like
george
town,
which
i
suppose
nobody
has
ever
heard
who
doesn't
come
from
colorado,
once
had
18,000
people
and
it's
now
got
population
of
600
in
an
assortment
of
rather
nice
summer
houses.
central
city
of
which
every
has
heard
because
of
an
opera
had
the
opera
because
it
had
something
like
15,000
exceedingly
affluent
minors
and
it
now
has
a
population
that's
300.
the
county
of
las
animas
once
had
a
flourishing
population
because
coal
was
mined
there
in
great
quantity
and
i
suppose
the
coal
still
obtains
in
great
quantity,
but
the
population
doesn't,
because
nobody
mines
it
anymore
and
the
population
has
gone
away
and
continues
to
go
away.
the
situation
is
very
much
like
that
which
typifies
the
united
states
generally
from
the
period
after
world
war
i
to
the
present
time,
in
that
population
has
tended
to
migrate
into
a
series
of
metropolitan
centers
maybe
30
in
number
and
the
statisticians
state
that
70%
or
90%
of
all
american
population
will
be
in
those
30
centers
by
1980,
a
good
part
of
it
is
now.
the
result
is
that
almost
two-thirds
of
the
populations
of
the
state
live
in
the
three
urban
areas
and
one-third
lives
in
all
of
the
rest
of
the
enormous
expanse
of
the
state.
now
getting
back
to
the
senate
and
trying
to
relate
this
matter
in
some
logical
sense
to
it,
the
senate
as
i
say
was
by
the
amendment
frozen
in
exactly
the
manner
in
which
the
senate
had
been
districted
under
the
statutes
declared
invalid
by
the
court,
prior
to
the
amendment
except
that
four
senators
were
added,
one
being
given
to
boulder
county,
one
to
adams,
one
to
jefferson,
and
one
to
arapahoe
and
except
that
a
tiny
county
called
elbert
which
consists
of
a
number
of
cattle
ranches
and
no
habited
places
at
all
really,
except
one
with
250
people
in
it,
was
the
next
to
a
different
district
for
purposes
of
balance,
the
elbert
change
does
not
statistically
make
any
difference
and
it
doesn't
in
any
governmental
sense,
it
was
a
convenience
for
which
some
reason
might
be
perhaps
announced.
the
result
--
oh
yes
then
the
amendment
further
provides
that
these
districts
and
it
incorporates
the
unconstitutional
statute,
i
use
the
word
unconstitutional
because
the
court
said
it
was
unconstitutional,
it
incorporates
it
by
reference,
by
specific
terms
in
haec
verba
and
then
it
says
that
this
statue
may
not
be
changed
by
any
general
assembly
at
any
time
in
the
future.
it
provides
that
so
far
as
the
senate
districts
adopted
from
the
old
statute
are
concerned
these
are
fixed,
but
so
far
as
multi
members
senate
districts,
the
multi
member
senate
districts
which
will
now
be
denver,
adams,
jefferson,
arapahoe,
boulder,
el
paso,
and
pueblo
counties,
these
districts
must
be
redistricted
each
ten
years
on
the
basis
of
population.
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
bifurcation
in
the
senate
areas,
but
it
does
provide
so.
if
it's
a
multimember
district
it
must
be
redistricted,
but
otherwise
it
may
not
be
changed
and
so
if
population
continues
to
go
away,
it
goes
but
the
senator
remains.
if
population
is
crescent
it
increases
but
the
senate
remains.
now
this
was
not
a
matter
idly
entered
into,
it
was
entered
into
on
the
basis
of
a
measure
presented
under
the
referendum
provisions
of
the
colorado
constitution
and
very
carefully
calculated
and
very
elaborately
sold
to
the
electorate
and
successfully
sold
to
the
electorate.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
electorate
voted
for
the
measure
more
often
than
it
does
for
the
opposing
measure
or
didn't
vote
at
all.
it's
hard,
as
i
say
to
analyze
these
things
absolutely
because
of
the
fact
that
you
may
not
vote
on
measure
or
vote
on
one
you
may
vote
on
both
of
them,
do
as
you
please.
they're
all
independently
submitted,
but
if
these
did
get
substantial
popular
back,
it
did
so
for
a
variety
of
reasons
i
would
suppose.
i
don't
know
that's
it
fruitful
to
try
to
go
into
them
as
a
matter
of
political
exegesis
among
other
things
the
notion
of
not
having
single
member
districts
has
always
distressed
people
because
it's
very
hard
to
sort
out
34
candidates
in
an
election.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitution
problem
we
have
before
us,
but
it
was
no
doubt
an
appealing
factor
to
the
electorate.
many
other
factors
might
have
entered
into
the
problem
but
the
problem
is
we
have
the
senate
as
it
is.
now
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
colorado
senate
as
it
exists
intentionally
and
permanently
divorced
from
population
as
a
criteria
having
a
history
in
which
population
has
been
really
the
only
basic
criteria
is
rational.
and
if
rational
and
not
invidiously
discriminatory
whether
it
is
within
the
tale
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
not?
we
have
submitted
that
it
is
not
because
of
several
very
clear
facts.
first
all
that
it
did
was
embody,
as
a
constitutional
provision,
a
statute
which
was
a
declared
by
the
courts
to
be
invidious
and
which
has
no
change
except
the
(inaudible)
on
it
of
four
additional
members.
now
even
the
four
additional
members
don't
make
any
particular
sense
if
i
may
refer
to
the
solicitor
general's
map
without
the
impropriety
of
invasion
of
authorship
several
things
do
appear
rather
clearly
on
it.
boulder
county
which
is
marked
on
the
map
as
having
74,254
persons,
it
gets
two
senators.
this
reduces
the
portion
to
37,000
to
127.
districts
11
and
12,
el
paso
county,
71,871;
it's
stays
at
two
senators
that
is
though
it
has
twice
as
much
claim
initially
to
another
senator
as
boulder
had,
it
doesn't
get
anything
but
it
stays
in
the
same
position
it
was
with
no
relief
of
any
kind
granted
to
it.
pueblo
remains
in
a
similarly
awkward
position.
it
had
two
senators
this
raised
it
to
59,000
per
senator
but
it
gets
no
relief
and
boulder
is
given
an
extra
senator.
adams,
jefferson
and
arapahoe
really
aren't
helped
terribly
much
because
as
we
have
indicated
in
appendix
c
to
the
briefs
filed
they
come
closer
to
requiring
three
senators
apiece
than
two,
they're
given
two
but
they
--
even
given
the
two
they
come
out
with
60,000,
56,000
and
63,000
persons
per
senator
represented
as
compared
with
something
like
las
animas
which
has
19,983
persons
represented
by
a
senator.
the
same
distortion
was
just
popped
out
but
the
distortion
now
is
said
to
become
a
constitutional
rather
than
the
statutory
provision,
and
somehow
this
mal-assortment
of
four
members
is
supposed
to
have
satisfied
matters.
now
there
are
curious
justifications
given
for
it.
the
record,
seeking
to
justify
it,
has
attained
a
greek
chorus
that
runs
through
it.
the
greek
chorus
is
composed
of
the
words
topography,
geography
and
history
rather
(inaudible).
it
doesn't
vary
at
all.
only
that
when
you
examine
the
geography,
the
topography
and
the
history
as
enunciated
by
the
witnesses,
it
is
very
hard
to
ascertain
what
precisely
they
meant
or
how
you
equate
these
things
with
the
actuality
of
the
distribution.
the
history
merely
states
that
there
used
to
be
people
in
the
mountain
mining
counties
and
when
there
were
people
they
were
represented
and
that
now
historically
the
areas
should
be
represented.
i
don't
mean
to
be
flippant
in
any
sense,
but
this
is
kind
of
history
that
is
precisely
parallel
to
the
russian
borough
system
which
was
advocated
as
history
in
england
in
the
1830s.
it
was
advocated
that
old
sarum
should
continue
to
have
three
members
of
parliament
because
it
had
once
been
a
seaport
in
the
cathedral
city
though
it
had
been
reduced
to
three
persons.
and
in
the
same
way
you
can
argue
that
gilpin
county
should
continue
to
be
represented
because
it
once
had
some
quite
colorful
people
and
a
great
deal
of
silver
and
gold
and
still
possesses
an
opera
house
but
it
has
600
residents
and
300
of
them
live
in
one
city
and
it
has
nothing
else.
once
population
has
gone
away
there
is,
we
submit,
nothing
left
to
represent;
a
representative
system,
it
does
not
represent
mountains
or
plains,
it
doesn't
represent
water,
it
doesn't
represent
cattle,
it
doesn't
represent
sheep
as
opposed
to
them
and
that
is
in
the
record
too
that
it
should,
it
represents
only
whoever
lives
in
the
area
and
if
no
one
does,
then
we
submit
that
the
area
cannot
be
represented
any
longer.
we
have
some
startlingly
testimony
in
this
record.
a
portion
of
it,
the
testimony
of
dean
rogers
which
is
contained
in
an
exhibit
appended
to
the
appellee's
brief,
it
is
a
large
part
of
the
record,
the
court
dispensed
with
the
printing
of
the
record
but
the
appellees
did
print
the
substantial
portion
as
their
exhibit
and
this
appears
at
page
81.
dean
rogers
was
a
principal,
historical
expert
for
the
state
and
one
of
the
questions
asked
to
him
was,
at
the
bottom
of
80,
“yes
now
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
your
statements
in
examination
by
counsel
was
it
is
a
belief
with
persons
advocating
population
on
the
pennsylvania
basis
as
i
understand
it,
that
heavily
populated
areas
are
dangerous
if
given
equal
representation.
may
i
ask
to
whom
they're
dangerous?”
“dangerous
to
the
welfare
of
the
state,”
and
editor
root
who
is
the
most
famous
and
best
knows
spokesman
of
this
point
of
view,
setting
conferences
for
the
new
york
constitution
in
the
1890s,
i
think
1894
that
the
heavily
populated
area
should
not
be
represented
as
generously
as
the
rural
areas
because
the
cities
from
their
very
effective
population
could
organize
in
a
way
in
which
they
had
much
greater
strength.
they
were
subject
to
political
machines,
subject
to
the
activities
of
chambers
of
commerce
and
various
other
organizations,
elements
which
were
not
applicable
to
rural
areas
and
he
therefore
carried
successfully
an
amendment
to
the
proposed
constitution
of
new
york
which
limited
representation
of
the
big
cities.
“dean
rogers
do
i
understand
if
--
that
there
is
not
in
your
opinion
a
possibility
of
successful
rural
political
organization
in
a
state
such
as
colorado?”
“well,
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
the
most
striking
organization
of
colorado
which
is
apparent
the
political
organization
which
is
influenced
the
state
that
surrounded
denver
and
the
like.”
and
then
finally
just
the
–
a
categorical
statement
that
urban
populations
are
dangerous,
evil
in
the
much
greater
sense
of
the
word
i
take
it,
and
they
should
not
be
represented.
well
then
of
course
the
polity
is
in
an
extraordinary
state
of
danger
because
90%
of
the
population
is
urban
and
this
is
not
we
submit
a
rational
thesis
and
being
an
irrational
thesis,
we
suggest
that
it
is
perhaps
not
within
the
purview
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
we
get
into
another
problem
it
is
alleged
that
colorado
and
the
reply
briefs
make
much
of
this
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
colorado
is
a
state
with
great
geographical
differential
and
in
which
communications
are
exceedingly
difficult.
i
do
not
mean
to
be
pejorative,
but
this
is
in
a
sense
nonsensical.
in
december
of
this
year,
if
i
may
use
a
personal
illustration
i
was
required
to
try
a
case
in
grand
junction
which
is
directly
over
the
mountains
from
denver
in
a
straight
line
during
the
worst
period
of
the
year.
i
left
after
my
breakfast
by
aero
plane,
i
arrived
in
grand
junction
in
time
for
court,
i
tried
the
case
in
grand
junction
returned
by
plane
and
had
my
dinner
in
denver.
now
this
traverses
the
whole
of
the
dangerous
western
slope
area,
the
week
following
i
was
required
to
be
in
washington,
in
the
department
of
agriculture.
it
took
me,
it
being
admittedly
an
unusual
week,
a
larger
amount
of
time
to
traverse
the
area
from
friendship
airport
into
washington
than
it
had
taken
to
traverse
the
area
across
the
(inaudible)
of
the
rockies
from
denver
to
grand
junction,
and
it
was
somewhat
a
more
tiring
trip.[laughter]
the
point
is
that
i'm
afraid
the
isolation
of
the
state
falls
now
into
the
area
of
mythology.
we
read
in
the
newspapers
that
aspen,
a
city
who's
character
would
hardly
be
determinable
from
the
briefs
in
which
it
is
described
as
having
television
only
from
kansas
i
believe
and
able
to
receive
radio
only
from
glenwood
springs
and
perhaps
mail
only
by
carrier
pigeon
or
husky
in
the
bad
part
of
the
year,
but
this
is
not
very
recognizable
when
we
read
in
our
papers
that
these
three
members
of
the
cabinet
spend
weekends
skiing
there
and
seem
to
be
able
to
attend
their
duties
the
following
monday
morning
with
no
difficulty
at
all.
they
usually
arrive
by
air
and
they
land,
skiing
is
a
major
occupation
in
the
state
and
out
of
denver
every
weekend
into
the
far
fastness
of
each
of
the
so
called
remote
senatorial
districts
at
least
80,000
people
make
their
way
usually
on
friday
evening
and
get
back
usually
on
sunday
night
with
almost
nothing
of
incident
to
report
except
whatever
might
transpire
on
the
slopes
and
i
suppose
it's
not
of
representative
interest
in
that
regard.
the
state's
geographical
bifurcations
are
not
as
great
as
stated
and
they
have
no
basis.
now
the
other
matters
and
as
the
solicitor
has
mentioned
this
with
much
more
potency
i
think
than
we
did
in
our
briefs,
the
other
matters
that
are
mentioned
as
justifying
the
differentia
which
are
imposed
upon
the
state
representation,
are
economic
matters
into
their
interest
is
the
way
the
lower
court
expressed
them.
it
is
hypothesized
that
there
are
many
economic
facets
to
the
life
of
colorado,
this
is
quite
true,
it
is
a
curious
state
in
that
denver
which
overwhelmingly
contains
its
population
is
a
city
obviously
not
supportable
by
the
state
itself,
but
acting
as
a
major
commercial
distribution
center
and
a
major
economic
function
for
a
great
group
of
western
states.
the
state
itself
contains
a
belt
of
cattle
farming,
a
belt
of
sheep
raising.
it
has
the
great
plains
area
which
are
an
ideal
wheat
region.
it
has
an
irrigated
crops
region,
which
is
of
great
significance
and
it
is
still
mineralogically
quite
important
part
of
the
mining
scheme.
it
does
have
problems
resulting
from
its
geography
and
agriculture
connected
with
water.
this
is
much
mentioned
in
the
briefs
and
somewhat
in
the
opinions.
we
do
unusual
things
with
water.
we
make
it
move
itself
across
the
mountain
range
and
then
we
generate
some
electricity
with
it
and
then
we
move
it
back
under
the
mountain
range,
but
--
and
the
result
from
time
to
time
as
the
court
no
doubt
knows,
disputes
concerning
its
utilization.
but
this
is
also
we
submit
not
a
basis
for
representation.
only
one
constitution
of
which
i
have
any
recollection
in
recent
years
has
tried
to
give
a
legislative
representation
to
specific
economic
interests.
the
weimar
republic
attempted
it
from
1922
to
about
1926
in
its
upper
chamber.
it
never
succeed
in
computing
the
formula
on
which
the
several
interests
might
be
represented
and
the
upper
chamber
of
all
the
unfortunate
things
in
that
unfortunate
experiment
proved
the
most
disastrous.
we
cannot
have
a
senator
for
beef
or
a
senator
for
sheep
or
a
senator
for
water
or
a
senator
for
wheat,
barley
or
sugar
beets.
that
is
impossible
and
frankly
it
is
somewhat
(inaudible)
to
assume
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
senator
from
denver,
bad
though
they
are
painted
who
does
not
have
in
mind
sugar
beets,
water,
wheat,
barley,
cattle
and
sheep
also,
we
exist
on
them.
the
entire
state
does
and
there
is
no
great
urban
blackness
that
is
trying
to
trample
them
out,
that
would
be
foolishness.
all
that
one
can
do
in
a
situation
of
this
sort
it
must
be
submitted
is
to
submit
that
constitution
of
it,
there
is
some
kind
of
an
ethos
which
underlies
representation.
that
ethos
must
be
that
the
representative
represents
something.
if
he
represents
something
then
it
can
only
be
people,
because
otherwise
there
is
no
criterion
for
representation
other
than
one
so
loose
as
to
lead
to
a
latitudinarianism
of
representation
that
must
prove
ultimately
fatal.
if
you
say
that
you
are
giving
an
area
a
representative
because
there
are
cattle
in
the
area,
then
as
the
solicitor
points
out
this
is
invidious
in
itself,
the
cattle
do
not
have
a
right
to
be
represented,
nor
do
the
people
who's
wealth
is
invested
in
them
have
any
more
right
of
representation
than
those
who
are
invested
in
sheep
or
those
who
are
invested
in
an
oil
refinery
in
an
urban
area.
there
is
no
more
predicate
for
the
one
than
for
the
other.
we
therefore
have
in
the
state
presented
perhaps
the
most
straightforward
situation
of
representational
difficulty
within
the
state
legislative
field
presented
in
any
of
the
cases
to
date
before
the
court,
because
we
have
simply
the
question
“may
the
electorate
itself
at
whatever
instance
and
for
whatever
reason
change
the
course
of
its
legislative
history
and
create
a
senate
admittedly
not
representative
of
population
and
intentionally
freezing
a
scheme
which
ran
counter
to
a
required
population
representation,
appeasing
that
scheme
by
the
grant
of
for
senators
to
desperate
districts
peculiarly
and
inadequately.
it
is
said
that
in
some
manner
the
sanction
of
the
people
grants
a
peculiar
sanction
to
this
matter
and
that
if
nothing
else,
the
court
should
disregard
from
point
of
equity,
the
problem
which
is
raised
in
this
matter
and
apply
us
(inaudible)
doctrine.
we
submit
that
this
is
hardly
true.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes
the
argument
was
made
of
course
because
it
is
made
in
each
of
the
so
called
local
federal
schemes.
the
argument
has
a
great
weakness.
first
of
course
it's
historical
weakness
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
states.
we
have
discussed
it
in
the
brief
at
some
length
and
we
have
pointed
out
particularly
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
colorado.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
if
you
had
an
upper
house
which
was
in
some
manner
selected
totally
irrespective
of
population,
and
if
you
have
a
constitutional
scheme
which
pretended
to
do
that,
i
can
at
least
intellectually
think
of
an
argument
which
might
sustain
it,
but
we
don't
have
anything
of
that
kind
and
never
did.
colorado
has
always
had
a
bicameral
legislature.
it
never
had
a
bicameral
legislature,
the
bicameralism
which
was
based
on
any
different
criteria
in
one
house
than
in
the
other
house.
each
was
selected
on
the
basis
of
population
and
population
alone
eventually
on
a
weighted
aggregate
basis,
almost
if
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes
differently
arranged
in
different
sections.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
oh
no,
the
interests
in
a
sense
are
represented.
in
fact
in
a
sense
they
are
over
represented.
the
senate
has
been
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
very
little
more
than
that,
we
ask
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
no
this
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
the
same
interests
i
think
turn
up
in
the
both
houses,
but
perhaps
weighted
slightly
different
in
the
two
houses
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
you
could.
that
would
be
quite
possible.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
think
that,
that
occurs
in
any
two
house
system
and
its
of
course
the
only
utility
in
a
two
house
system
at
all,
that
you
could
get
different
results
at
different
times,
but
this
doesn't
result
from
the
fact
that
the
people
come
from
different
places
because
they
don't
come
from
enough
difference
to
do
that.
it
comes
from
the
fact
of
the
multiple
considerations,
the
double
consideration
of
measures
and
a
double
set
of
procedures
and
scrutiny
and
any
two
houses
as
any
court
and
a
reviewing
court
will
perhaps
produce
two
different
results
equally
dispassionately
and
candidly
viewing
the
same
matter.
i
think
by
bicameralism
as
by
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes,
both
houses
were
like
the
colorado
senate.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
the
colorado
senate
doesn't
represent
people.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
no,
the
colorado
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
the
colorado
senate
historically
has
been
predicated
on
the
same
weighted
aggregate
formula
that
now
exists
or
that
up
to
1962
existed.
the
colorado
senate
now
doesn't
represent
anything.
it
represents
and
will
progressively
represent
whatever
happened
to
exist
in
the
year
it
was
frozen
1962
or
the
year
of
the
formulas
were
established
1933.
it
won't
represent
anything
else
because
it
took
the
willy-nilly
formula
completely
unconstitutional
in
itself.
it
added
four
members
to
it
and
it
said
that
this
may
not
be
changed
forever.
that
effectively
is
what
i
would
assume
that
it
was
purposed
to
do
and
in
its
essence
accomplished.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
think
if
i
may
phrase
it
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
think
there
is
perhaps
reason
in
the
sense
of
motive
mr.
justice
white
but
being
charitable
i
would
rather
not
attribute
those
specifics
motivations,
and
the
solicitor
general
i
think
has
analyzed
as
one
analyzing
the
surface
may
do
very
well
indeed
the
effects
of
the
situation.
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
solicitor
general
basically,
except
that
i
should
state
that
much
more
was
involved
in
the
solicitor
general's
phrase
a
reapportionment
which
preserved
each
senate
seat
that
then
existed,
than
might
otherwise
be
stated.
the
matter
was
a
matter
in
a
broad
sense
presented
as
well
as
a
political
matter
could
be
presented,
practically
every
kind
of
coating
that
makes
delicious
to
an
electorate
i
think
capable
of
being
swallowed,
was
put
around
a
dosage
which
isn't
exactly
swallowable
in
this
and
the
outside
taste
was
almost
as
nice
as
the
cherry
and
a
cough
syrup
to
a
child.
the
result
isn't
very
good.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
state
it
without
being
more
blunt
than
i
think
manners
permit.
the
problem
that
exists
then
is
i
think
well
summarized
by
the
solicitor
general
when
he
shows
in
his
blue
line,
red
line
differentiation
on
the
map.
the
fact
that
even
granting
the
criteria
that
exists
the
whole
situation
could
be
very
much
be
iterated
by
taking
only
three
of
the
districts
and
combining
them
with
the
joining
districts
and
reaching
a
much
more
rational
and
more
sensible
basis
aside
from
what
could
be
done
by
proper
basic
districting.
i
note
that
my
time
is
almost
expired
and
i
had
asked
and
mr.
ginsberg
too
that
i
leave
him
some
little
time
for
rebuttal,
i
hope
that
this
has
not
been
too
confusing
and
i
would
ask
the
court's
permission
unless
there
are
further
questions
to
cease
at
this
time
and
reserve
the
balance.
