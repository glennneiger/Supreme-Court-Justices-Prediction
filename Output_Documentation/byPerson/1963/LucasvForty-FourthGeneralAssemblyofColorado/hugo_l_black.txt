justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
(inaudible)
on
this
particular
comment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
state
of
colorado
has
reserved
its
people's
referendum
and
so
forth,
the
right
to
decide
how
they
elaborate
the
state,
is
there
any
difference
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
we
have
to
take
one
step
further
to
--
and
i
was
told
that
the
people
(inaudible),
assuming
that
the
people
of
colorado
(inaudible)
as
far
as
the
people
are
concerned
pass
any
law
that
is
not
the
against
colorado
constitution,
the
question
is
here
whether
they
passed
one
against
the
federal
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
my
only
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
right
there
we
finally
get
to
(inaudible)
you
complain
that
the
people
could
buy
referendums,
do
something
in
connection
with
–
representative
would
violate
the
federal
constitution
i
am
sure
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
the
last
cause
of
what
you
said
is
the
only
one
we
are
interested
in
it,
whether
it
violates
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
say
so
that
(inaudible)
involved
unnecessary
though
to
talk
about
the
referendum
and
so
forth,
the
people
knew
more
to
violate
the
constitution
by
referendum
and
they
can't
do
without
a
referendum
can
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
our
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
again?
why
do
we
have
to
go
in
to
that
to
decide
whether
or
not
what
they've
done?
i
assume
with
you
that
colorado
can
do
all
that.
i
rather
like
it
if
i
may
say
(inaudible),
it
gives
the
people
a
better
chance
to
have
strong
(inaudible)
government,
assuming
all
of
that
and
we
get
down
to
the
question,
that
rather
the
way
they
have
apportioned
violates
the
federal
constitution
and
it
is
so
argument
they
that
some
how
depends
on
the
people's
right
to
have
referendum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
our
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
know
who
raised
it
but
that's
not
our
business
it,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
state's
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
the
comparative
population
in
the
rural
areas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
just
wondering
if
that
is
out
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
house
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
their
proper
percentage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
senate
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
senate
does
and
the
other
doesn't.
so
the
senate
has
veto
power
over
what
one
–-
the
law
passes
–-
that's
where
the
people
are
represented
on
equal
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
range
that
is
not
–
on
that
difference
--
i
don't
know,
it
is
range
that
does
not
–-
so
the
small
percentage,
much
smaller
than
50%
of
the
people
elect
the
members
of
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
country
and
city
now,
i'm
talking
about
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
people
of
the
whole
state.
if
your
senate
elected
by
a
minority,
if
a
majority
of
your
senate
elected
by
minority
of
the
people
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
senate,
but
when
you
finally
get
through
in
there,
does
it
turn
out
if
a
number
of
your
senatorial
district
have
a
much
larger
percentage
according
to
population
than
do
-–
large
number
of
the
other
senatorial
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
any
of
the
indications
will
require
absolutely
arithmetic
provisions.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think,
we
all
recognize
that
that
cannot
be
done.
it
is
our
suggestion
that
-–
so
nearly
if
that
must
be
the
goal
and
must
be
followed,
so
nearly
as
practicable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
between
boulder
and
denver?
you
surprised
me
when
you
say
it's
a
suburb?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
considered
a
suburb.
