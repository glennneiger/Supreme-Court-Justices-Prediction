mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
stated
that
he
would
argue
the
merits
of
the
case
first,
and
then
would
get
into
the
equitable
considerations
later.
mr.
hart
who
will
follow
me
and
myself
have
decided
on
that
same
procedure.
i
will
argue
the
merits
of
amendment
7
or
as
we
have
referred
to
it
in
our
briefs,
and
as
we
may
refer
to
it
in
our
arguments
as
the
colorado
plan,
and
mr.
hart
will
then
discuss
the
equitable
features
of
the
case.
now,
i
think
perhaps
at
the
very
beginning,
i
would
like
to
clear
maybe
a
misconception
with
regard
to
the
testimony
of
dean
rogers.
it
has
been
stated
here
and
a
portion
of
his
testimony
has
been
cited
i
believe
out
of
context,
that
the
people
in
the
urban
areas
are
not
as
good
as
the
people
in
the
rural
areas.
well,
i
would
like
to
state
that
dean
rogers
was
called
as
a
historian,
as
an
expert
on
government,
and
i
just
like
to
give
the
court
something
of
who
dean
rogers
is.
he
was
the
dean
of
the
law
school
at
the
university
of
denver,
university
of
colorado,
former
professor
at
law,
master
at
timothy
dwight
college
at
yale
university,
former
assistant
secretary
of
state,
mayor
of
georgetown,
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
state
historical
society
of
colorado,
author
of
many
books,
and
so
forth.
he
was
giving
the
history
of
the
ratio
system
and
as
a
historian
–-
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
ratio
system
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
--
which
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
few
moments
in
my
discussion.
but,
he
did
not
base
his
opinion
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
rational
plan,
because
the
city
voters
are
better
than
any
other
voters,
nor
did
anyone
in
this
case
ever
take
that
position,
and
we
certainly
do
not
take
it
now.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
position
of
dean
rogers
is
very
clearly
set
forth
in
the
record
when
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
has
heard
all
of
these
various
elements
that
were
considered
in
this
testimony
that
was
presented
and
whether
he
thought
that
the
apportionment
was
on
a
rational
basis,
and
he
testified
that
it
was
and
that's
the
very
basis
of
his
testimony
and
that
is
our
position
here.
certainly,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
sugar
beets
or
cattle
or
anything
of
that
kind
should
be
represented,
but
we
do
take
the
position
that
in
a
bicameral
legislative
body
that
all
of
the
people
should
be
represented
not
merely
the
majority
or
the
minority
but
all
of
the
people
in
the
state.
now,
people
have
various
interests,
and
in
colorado
ordinarily,
the
interest
of
the
people
depends
upon
where
they
live.
if
you
live
in
an
agricultural
area,
your
interests
are
one
way,
if
you
live
in
a
dry
area
where
you
have
no
water,
then
water
becomes
the
lifeblood
of
that
community
and
that
becomes
your
pre-dominant
interest,
and
if
you're
in
a
mining
area,
the
same
thing
applies.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
what
the
witnesses
testified
too
in
the
court,
were
not
economic
matters
so
much
but
only
insofar
as
they
relate
to
people,
people
with
their
interests,
and
their
hopes
and
their
aspirations,
people
whose
very
livelihood
depends
upon
certain
legislative
problems
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
plan
is
to
have
the
whole
of
the
state
represented,
so
that
the
interest
of
these
people
maybe
properly
represented
by
knowledgeful
legislators
who
are
familiar
with
their
problems.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
that
is
true.
however,
if
you
have
it
on
a
strict
population
basis
in
both
houses,
then
you
simply
have
a
homogeneous
body
that
differs
only
in
name,
because
the
complete
representation
will
be
concentrated
in
certain
areas,
and
other
areas
will
have
so
little
representation
as
not
to
be
heard
at
all.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
effective
representation,
i
think
that
is
a
better
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
little
-–
better
word
than
what
i
used.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
it
isn't
so
much
a
matter
of
weighting
because
i
think
when
we
get
down
to
the
statistics
here,
it's
going
to
become
apparent
that
if
we
consider
the
majority
and
the
minority
as
a
difference
between
the
rural
areas
and
the
urban
areas.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
have
just
taken
it
from
their
brief
and
i
say
if
we
consider
it
that
way
the
urban
areas
have
control
not
only
of
the
legislature
but
also
of
the
senate
as
the
figures
will
very
conclusively
show.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
don't
believe
it
was.
i
think
it
was
simply
constructed
on
the
basis
as
set
forth
in
our
constitution
has
originally
adopted
that
the
representation
of
a
legislative
body
should
be
to
represent
the
state
as
a
whole
and
to
have
everyone
have
effective
representation
in
that
body,
that,
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
bicameralism,
and
we'll
get
down
to
those
statistics
in
–-
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
maybe,
i
better
come
down
to
the
constitutional
questions
because
i
think
that
there
was
probably
a
little
confusion
on
that
yesterday
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
so
i
will
refer
back
to
the
colorado
constitution
as
it
was
adopted
in
1876.
now
under
that
constitutional
provision,
we
have
this
provision,
it
wasn't
by
population
at
all,
reading
from
section
45,
the
general
assembly
shall
provide
by
law
for
an
enumeration
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
state
in
the
year
of
our
lord
1885
and
every
tenth
year
thereafter,
and
at
the
session
next
following
such
enumeration,
and
also
at
the
session
next
following
enumeration
made
by
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
revise
and
adjust
the
apportionment
for
senators
and
representatives
on
the
basis
of
such
enumeration
according
to
ratios
to
be
fixed
by
law
and
that's
what
i
meant
a
moment
ago
by
the
ratio
system.
in
other
words,
in
1876,
there
was
a
ratio
system
adopted
where
the
legislature
would
fix
certain
ratios
not
according
to
population,
not
according
to
one
of
the
each
county,
but
by
certain
ratios
that
they
would
adopt.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
if
it
stated
that
it
should
be
done
according
to
populations
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
instead
of
enumeration
according
to
ratios
to
be
fixed
by
laws
what
it
said.
if
it
had
said
population,
then
the
state
constitution
providing
for
an
apportionment
according
to
population,
i
don't
believe
that
the
legislature
could
adopt
a
law
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
however
–-
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
the
context
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
enumeration,
and
we've
got
to
take
the
entire
provision,
enumeration
according
to
ratios
to
be
fixed
by
law,
which
means
that
the
legislature
may
fix
certain
ratios
which
they
did.
in
other
words,
they
would
say
that
first
19,000
would
elect
one
and
then
every
additional
25,000
would
elect
another
which
i
think
is
far
different
than
a
matter
of
strictly
population.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
it's
been
so
interpreted
down
through
the
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
have
been
many
such
apportionments.
i
think
there
have
been
at
least
five
or
six
down
through
the
years
where
they
would
fix
different
ratios.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
in
effect,
they
have
recognized
that
theory
in
several
cases,
one
of
them
is
them
is
the
armstrong
case
which
i'll
refer
to
in
just
a
few
moments
that
that
is
the
theory
that
had
been
followed,
but
that
ratio
system
was
abolished
by
the
people
in
amendment
number
7.
in
other
words,
when
they
passed
this
amendment
they
did
away
with
the
ratio
system
and
i
believe
it
might
clarify
things
just
a
little,
if
i
would
go
into
the
history
of
this
matter
a
little
bit.
our
bill
of
rights
which
is
article
2,
section
1
provides
that
all
political
powers
vested
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i'm
reading
from
article
2,
section
1
of
the
bill
of
rights,
it's
one
of
our
briefs.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
do
you
have
the
--
i
can't
put
my
finger
right
on
at
the
moment,
maybe
counsel
can
find
it.
it's
a
very
short
provision.
so
all
political
power
is
vested
in
and
derived
from
the
people
that
all
governmental
right
originates
from
the
people,
is
founded
upon
their
will
only,
and
is
instituted
solely
for
good
of
the
whole.
so
there
we
have
the
first
enunciation
in
our
bill
of
rights
that
first
of
all
the
people
are
supreme
and
secondly
that
the
government
is
to
operate
for
the
good
of
the
whole.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
oh
no,
this
was
the
original
constitutional
provision,
i'm
back
now
to--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
i
was
just
going
into
the
constitutional
history
to
show
that
in
colorado
the
people
have
always
reserved
their
sovereignty.
right
from
the
time
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
time
that
they
passed
their
first
--
their
initiative
and
referendum
act
in
1910
where
they
reserved
to
themselves,
the
right
to
initiate
constitutional
amendments,
to
initiate
laws
and
they
had
a
right
to
revoke
any
law
that
was
passed
by
the
legislature
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
initiative
they
had
a
provision
that
even
the
governor
could
not
veto
any
act
that
was
initiated
and
passed
upon
by
the
people.
so
they
have
always
reserved
the
right
under
the
constitution,
under
the
amendment
of
the
constitution,
and
the
initiative
and
referendum
to
pass
upon
these
matters.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1932,
when
the
people
initiated
a
measure
and
passed
it
and
the
legislature
then
instead
of
adapting
the
initiated
measure
attempted
to
pass
a
different
measure
then
the
people
had
voted
upon,
and
the
matter
got
to
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
initiated
measure
adopted
by
the
people
and
struck
down
the
one
that
was
passed
by
the
legislature
and
justice
butler
in
a
very
strong
decision
set
for
that
the
general
assembly
was
the
creature
of
the
people
and
that
final
sovereignty
resided
in
the
people,
and
that
they
had
the
ultimate
right.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
is
there
any
difference
of
opinion?
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difference
between
our
position
and
the
solicitor
general,
justice
black,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
they
certainly
cannot
pass
a
law
that
is
contrary
to
the
federal
constitution.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
constitution
expressly
so
provides,
and
it
would
be
the
law
whether
it
provided
so
or
not.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
oh,
i
am
sure
we
do
not
take
that
position.
we
say
that
there
is
nothing.
we
say
that
it
does
not.
we
say
that
whatever
they
did,
they
did
pursuant
to
their
sovereign
power
and
without
violating
either
the
state
constitution
or
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
they
cannot
we
agree
with
that
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that
is
our
issue
and
the
only
reason
i
have
mentioned
it
is
that
a
statement
has
been
made
here,
that
certain
things
were
frozen
into
the
constitution
and
when
amendment
7
was
passed
that
certain
things
were
frozen
into
the
constitution
and
we
say
that
under
the
liberal,
initiative
provisions
that
we
have,
you
cannot
freeze
anything
into
the
constitution,
because
the
people
reserve
the
right
at
anytime
to
change
the
constitution,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
colorado,
the
initiative
and
referendum
has
been
used
very
freely.
with
regard
to
reapportionment,
there
have
been
8
major
reapportionments
after
colorado
become
a
state,
and
i
think
there
were
three
–-
it
was
still
a
territory
and
if
we
get
into
the
history
of
reapportionment
just
a
little
bit
to
show
how
often
it
has
been
used,
in
1954
there
was
a
measure
that
was
referred
to
the
people
with
regard
to
a
provision
where
by
the
house
would
be
elected
according
to
population
and
the
senate
would
remain
the
same
as
it
was
under
the
old
ratio
system.
that
matter
was
voted
upon
and
it
was
rejected
and
then
in
1950
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no,
i
was
only
going
into
that
from
the
standpoint
of
clearing
up
something
that
has
been
raised
here
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
election,
there
might
have
been
some
conclusion
as
to
the
people
when
they
voted
upon
amendment
number
7
and
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no
it
isn't
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
motive
of
the
people
or
the
motive
of
a
legislature
certainly
isn't
subject
to
review
by
the
courts.
so
then
i'll
get
down
right
down
to
the
very
point
justice
black
that
is
involved
here
as
to
whether
or
not
what
we
did
in
passing
amendment
number
7,
violated
the
federal
constitution,
i'm
sure
that
it
did
not
violate
the
state,
so
we
get
down
to
the
federal.
now
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
now
the
reason
is,
i
don't
think
they
would
want
to
be
less
solicitors,
but
in
order
to
recognize
the
many
problems
that
exist
in
the
state,
a
legislature
must
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
those
problems
with
the
constituents
in
that
particular
area.
now
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
if
this
was
designed
so
that
the
rural
areas
would
have
control
of
the
general
assembly,
then
i
think
that
would
be
true.
how
could
we
assume
that
if
they
had
control
of
the
general
assembly
that
they
would
be
more
solicitous
at
the
city,
than
if
the
city
had
control,
they
would
be
solicitous
of
the
rural,
but
that
isn't
our
situation
here.
in
other
words,
if
both
houses
were
so
apportioned
so
that
the
rural
area
would
have
more
votes
than
they
were
entitled
to
than
the
city,
now
that
would
be
a
correct
assumption,
but
here
we've
got
to
consider
the
general
assembly
as
a
whole.
we've
got
to
consider
both
houses
and
when
we
do
that,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
house
of
representatives
is
strictly
on
a
population
basis.
and
therefore,
the
urban
areas
have
72%
control
of
the
house.
now
we
get
down
to
the
senate
and
in
the
senate,
we
have
considered
population,
but
we
have
considered
factors
in
addition
to
population.
population
was
a
factor,
but
it
wasn't
the
only
factor.
there
were
other
factors
considered
and
in
considering
those
factors,
in
the
senate
the
urban
areas
still
have
control,
i
believe,
of
59%
of
the
senate.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
comparative
population?
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
the
house
is
72.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that
reflects
population.
therefore,
the
senate
is
something,
--
no,
it's
something
less
than
population
because
as
i
said,
justice
white,
we
did
consider
not
only
population
but
elements
in
addition
to
population.
in
other
words,
the
minorities
are
entitled
–
pardon
–
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
house
--
they
get
their
proper
percentage
in
the
house.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
and
the
senate
has
somewhat
less,
but
they
still
--
the
urban
the
areas
still
have
control.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes.
if
you
take
the
east
slope
area
which
is
predominantly
urban,
86.7%
urban,
they
still
have
control
of
both
houses.
this
is
not
a
range
so
that
the
urban
area
has
--
doesn't
have
control
of
one
of
the
houses.
no
matter
how
–
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
majority
of
the
senate.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
in
order
to
arrive
at
that
figure
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
in
order
to
arrive
at
that,
you
need
to
take
the
people
of
the
whole
state.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
we
would
have
to
take
it
by
senatorial
district
you
see,
because
we
do
not
elect
the
senators
at
large,
but
if
we
take
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
know
it
does
not.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
get
down
to
this
33.2%
that
they
are
speaking
about,
it
is
necessary
to
have
not
only
the
entire
rural
area,
but
they
have
got
to
take
some
of
the
representation
from
the
urban
areas.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that
is
true
if
they
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
if
they
yeah.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
20
would
be
a
majority,
but
in
order
to
do
that
as
i
stated,
it's
got
to
be
some
imponderables
that
are
almost
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that's
right.
now
if
we
look
at
their
plan
and
maybe
one
of
the
best
ways
to
test
whether
or
not
a
plan
is
rational,
has
a
rational
basis
or
not,
is
not
only
to
take
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
way
it
was
presented
at
the
three-judge
court.
and
by
the
way,
in
the
presentation
of
this
plan,
we
presented
a
lot
of
evidence
to
show
the
rationale
of
the
plan,
the
reason
for
the
plan.
we
have
this
report
prepared
by
the
university
of
denver,
we
had
expert
witnesses
on
colorado
and
its
history
and
so
forth,
but
the
appellants
presented
no
evidence
at
all.
all
they
presented
were
some
statistics,
but
no
testimony.
now
to
get
down
to
some
of
the
--
because
that
seems
to
be
the
crucial
point
here,
i
think
maybe
the
best
way
to
get
at
this
is
to
kind
of
analyze
the
plan
that
was
submitted
by
the
government
and
then
to
analyze
our
plan
and
also
the
plan
that
was
submitted
by
the
appellants.
now
if
we
get
down
to
an
analysis
of
their
plan
as
shown
by
their
map,
i
would
like
to
analyze
this
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no,
it
isn't
really
a
matter
of
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
as
i
can
conceive
it,
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
when
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado
have
adopted
a
constitutional
amendment,
one
that
provides
that
the
whole
of
the
state
is
to
be
represented
in
a
bicameral
body,
consisting
of
a
senate
and
the
legislature
where
they
have
complied
with
the
constitutional
provisions
of
their
state,
whether
or
not
the
plan
that
they
have
adopted
is
violative
of
any
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
now
we
say
that
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
that
is
the
issue,
but
in
resolving
that
issue,
we
get
down
to
a
proposition
as
to
what
right
does
each
individual
have.
in
other
words,
are
we
going
to
get
down
to
the
point
where
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
every
person
in
a
voting
for
a
state
legislative
office
is
entitled
to
the
same
vote
as
everybody
else
in
the
state.
if
we
are
down,
then
it's
down
to
the
proposition
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
be
strict
equality
in
electing
a
state
legislative
body
on
a
strict
per
capita
basis.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
then
we
get
down
to
getting
some
standards.
in
other
words,
first
we
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
i
say
that
the
people
of
each
individual
state
have
the
right
to
adopt
the
form
of
representative
government
that
they
see
fit,
provided
it
does
not
violate
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
if
this
court
construes
the
federal
constitution
to
mean
that
in
electing
a
state
legislative
body,
that
it
has
to
be
on
a
strict
per
capita
basis,
then
of
course,
that
becomes
the
interpretation.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no,
nobody
has
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
this
court
has
never
held
that.
nobody
has
the
power
to
change
it,
but
our
position
is
that
this
court
has
never
held.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
read
baker
v.
carr,
most
of
the
decisions
there,
that
have
touched
these
statements
here
-–
that
touch
upon
that
point
are
to
the
affect,
that
it
is
not
to
be
on
a
strict
per
capita
basis.
that
there
is
some
room
not
only
for
waiting,
but
some
room
for
the
individual
states
to
exercise
their
judgment
as
to
what
type
of
government
is
best
suited
for
their
needs
and
their
demands.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that
is
the
problem,
but
as
i've
read
the
decisions
in
so
far,
i
am
not
-–
not
so
far
as
ratio
matters
and
all
that
sort
of
things,
i
think
the
law
there
is
rather
clear.
but
when
we
come
down
to
what
proposition
of
state
apportionment,
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
decision
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
it
has
to
be
on
a
strict
per
capita
basis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
read
some
of
the
statements
of
the
justices
in
baker
v.
carr,
it
is
very
much
to
the
contrary
in
this
type
of
controversy
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
require
absolute
equality.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
baker
v.
carr,
we
have
a
statement
that
it's
a
well-known
and
familiar
principles
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that's
correct,
justice
harlan,
as
i
read
it.
and
i
think
that
is
the
basic
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
now
that
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
justice
harlan,
if
that
is
the
law
of
this
court
then
as
i
say
–
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
--
that
our
argument
is
over
because
our
position
is
that
not
--
has
not
been
enunciated
as
yet
as
a
law
of
this
court.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
any
invidious
discrimination
or
whether
or
not
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
i
believe
that's
–-
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
believe
that's
true.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
at
least
has
taken
the
position
that
there
are
certain
considerations
that
maybe
considered.
i
won't
take
the
time
to
go
into
those
now;
i
would
say
that
on
the
whole,
we
agree
with
those,
that
you
may
take
into
consideration
the
compactness
and
all
the
things
that
he
has
outlined,
but
we
are
down
to
what
are
the
requirements
and
the
only
requirements
that
we
have
and
in
our
brief
we
set
them
forth,
we
say
that
the
only
requirements,
the
only
guideposts
that
we
have
is,
the
well
known
and
familiar
standards
of
the
equal
protection
which
doesn't
require
absolute
equality
but
does
require
first
of
all,
that
it'd
be
in
pursuance
of
a
state
objective,
something
that's
within
the
proper
objectives
of
the
state
and
here
of
course
the
representation
of
the
whole
bicameralism,
these
are
all
proper
objectives
for
a
state
and
if
you
do
that
and
if
there
is
no
discrimination,
then
i
believe
we
have
complied
and
if
the
classes
are
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
it
would
have
to
be
a
rationally
justifiable
justification
and
there
must
be
no
discrimination
among
the
classes
which
is
the
point
that
the
solicitor
general
raised
and
i
think
that
we
have
complied
with
all
of
their
standards
and
our
position
is
that
the
only
standard
that
we
know
at
this
time
are
the
equal,
are
the
well
known
standards
of
equal
protection
and
we
believe
that
amendment
no.
7
does
comply
with
those
standards
because
if
we
look
at
these
various
districts
we
find
that
the
rural
districts
are
all
treated
exactly
alike
and
so
are
the
urban.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
that
is
exactly
right
and
that
was
the
very
purpose
of
having
that
report
made
and
presented
and
that
was
a
very
thrust
of
the
testimony
that
was
presented
in
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
you
are
in
the
free
(inaudible)
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
oh,
yeah.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
and
the
public
administration
and
--
has
been
a
district
for
a
long
time.
maybe
what
we
ought
to
do
at
this
point,
if
i
may,
would
be
simply
to
comment
upon
this.
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
apportionment
has
a
rational
basis.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
all
right!
now,
may
i
do
this?
the
solicitor
general
has
made
a
study
of
this
plan
and
has
made
certain
recommendations.
now
if
i
may
comment
upon
the
suggested
plan
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
this
was
one
of
the
suggestions
that
they
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
i
am
directing
my
attention
to
--
you
mean
walsenburg
and
huerfano
county
in
the
san
luis
valley?
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
i
will
get
down
to
your
walsenburg,
cannon
city
is
in
fremont
that
area
and
there
it
was
recommended,
very
well
justice
white,
pardon
me.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
by
the
district
well,
let's
see,
fremont
county,
cannon
city
is
in
fremont
county
which
is
district
25.
it's
a
combination
of
fremont
and
custer
counties.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
now
the
other
one
is,
when
we
come
down
to
los
animas
county
which
is
-
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
huerfano
and
then
we
have
district
23.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
that's
district
30.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
all
right!
now,
as
far
as
huerfano
county,
we
had
huerfano
county
joined
with
costilla
county
and
los
animas
county
to
form
one
district.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
but
in
doing
that
we
have
to
consider
the
plan
and
well,
if
the
los
animas
county
was
a
separate
county
--
now,
in
considering
the
history
of
los
animas
county
we
find
that
it
has
been
a
separate
senatorial
district
from
the
time
that
colorado
became
a
state
in
1876.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
there
have
been
some
changes
but
it
has
been
an
old
established
senatorial
district.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
the
population
has
gone
down
because
of
the
depressed
condition
of
the
coal
mines
down
in
the
general
area
and
that
whole
general
area,
the
whole
area.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
on
the
basis
that
they
have
certain
-–
if
you
see
this,
whole
southwest
area
only
has
three
representatives
for
the
whole
area.
now,
we
can
combine
those
anyway
we
want
to
combine
them
but
they
only
wind
up
with
three
anyway.
as
i
say,
there
maybe
other
arrangements
that
can
be
made.
we
say
that
our
plan
has
a
rational
basis
for
it,
but
you
may
rearrange
some
of
these
counties
in
different
ways.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
arrangements
maybe
numerous
and
still
have
some
rational
basis.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
if
you
give
each
of
them
a
senator,
you
would
have
two
and
then
you
may
eliminate
the
other
senators.
well,
i
would
say
that
that
arrangement
would
not
be
an
illogical
arrangement
to
combine
pueblo
and
las
animas.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
they
get
three
senators
because
we
have
an
area
here
that
is
a
greatly
depressed
area
that
has
many
peculiar
problems
of
its
own.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
yes,
the
whole
south
central
area
is
a
depressed
area.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no,
the
san
luis
valley
is
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
there
again
we
get
down
to
the
historical
grouping
of
the
county.
some
of
these
counties
have
been
grouped
in
that
fashion
for
many,
many
years.
and
as
i
say,
you
may
have
other
groupings
but
there's
been
a
lot
of
experimenting
over
the
years
in
grouping
the
counties
one
way
and
then
grouping
them
another
way
trying
to
get
a
community
of
interest.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
now
let's
see
we
had
jefferson
county
--
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
and
boulder
county.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
well,
both
of
these
are
rapidly
growing
counties.
of
course,
boulder
is
becoming
a
–-
but
that's
a
home
of
the
state
university
up
there,
and
it's
becoming
one
of
the
scientific
centers
of
the
country,
rapidly
growing,
lot
of
industry
moving
in.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
no,
that
is
true.
in
boulder
county,
they
were
faced
with
a
problem
of
either
leaving
it
down
to
one
which
would
not
give
them
enough.
you
can't
them
one
in
the
half,
you
see.
we'd
either
have
to
get
them
say
at
74,254
with
one
or
give
them
one
more.
mr.
anthony
f.
zarlengo
i
might
say
chief
justice
that
i
believe
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case
have
agreed
that
none
of
the
counties
on
the
east
slope
maybe
properly
joined
with
another
county,
just
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
various
problems.
i
think
that
has
been
agreed
by
all.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
