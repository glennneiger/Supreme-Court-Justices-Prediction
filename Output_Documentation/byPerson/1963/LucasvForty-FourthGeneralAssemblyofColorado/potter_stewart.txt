then
nobody

justice

this
court
has
never
held
anything
like

justice

then
you
have
to
have
a
rationally
justifiable
justification.
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
the
evidence
and
the
study
of
the
denver
research
institute,
the
university
of
denver,
(inaudible)
it's
an
oversimplification
to
talk
about
rural
and
urban
districts
in
colorado.
your
state
is
divided
into
three
of
the
four
basic
areas.
the
western
area
which
is
part
of
the
great
plains,
the
south
central
area
which
is
largely
spanish-american
and
it
is
impoverished
and
it
is
a
depressed
area,
the
urban
area
along
the
eastern
slope
going
from
boulder
south
to
(inaudible)
and
the
western
area
which
is
not
(inaudible)
businesses,
key
businesses
and
so
on.
i
think
a
rational
justification
of
your
actual
apportionment
is
what
you
ought
to
direct
yourself
to,
one
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
it's
not
a
matter
of
control
of
the
legislature
by
one
group
or
another.
it's
a
matter
of
bringing
to
the
senate,
representatives
of
these
areas
who
understand
the
particular
problems
of
those
areas.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
city
according
to
your
evidence
is
very
special
because
it
has
far
and
away
the
highest
percentage
of
people
in
public
administration
in
the
state
business.
justice

23.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand
if
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
requires
a
strict
numerical
representation,
all
--
everything
you've
mentioned
just
goes
down
the
drain
and
you
lose.
justice
potter
stewart
it
requires
out
of
both
houses
of
the
bicameral
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
requires
that
thing
you
lose,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
going
to
different
view.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
agree
though
that
so
far
as
the
basic
merits
of
this
case
goes,
so
far
as
the
constitutionality
of
this
plan
goes,
it
doesn't
make
any
real
difference
if
you
get
to
the
merits,
whether
this
plan
was
adopted
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
every
county
of
colorado
or
by
the
legislature
or
as
required
by
the
state
constitution
or
however,
but
what
the
--
i
gather
that
the
two
points
you
are
trying
to
make
in
emphasizing
that
this
was
adopted
by
the
people,
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
every
county
are
two,
two
points.
first,
that
a
plan
so
adopted
is
presumptively
rational
--
is
presumably
rational
and
secondly,
the
existence
of
the
referendum
and
the
initiative
in
your
state
means
that
there
is
an
adequate
alternative
remedy
and
that
therefore
possibly
a
court
need
not
intervene.
that
was
the
view
expressed
by
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
in
various
concurrences
in
baker
against
carr,
and
it
was
basically
the
same
view
expressed
by
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
colegrove
against
green.
so
the
vote
of
the
people
bears,
i
suppose,
on
those
two
points,
but
not
on
the
basic
constitutionality
of
this
plan,
doesn't
it?
justice

stewart
inaudible)
couldn't
you
agree
that
it
might
be
a
matter
of
understanding?
i
know
for
example
that
--
i
know
that
no
matter
how
much
justice
i
might
want
to
do
to
the
impoverished
areas
of
south
central
colorado,
involving
largely
spanish-american
population,
that
i
wouldn't
have
any
understanding
of
their
problems?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
find
these
constitutional
requirements,
these
are
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
one?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
say
a
word
about
them.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
