chief

does

(inaudible)
population?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
it
was
then
population
instead
of
enumeration,
what
would
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
instead
of
according
to
enumeration
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
enumeration
and
population
in
this
context?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
it
been
so
interpreted
by
your
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
did
your
court,
did
supreme
court
–
enunciated
the
theory
you
have
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from
if
we
could
see
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
abolishes
the
ratio
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
point
is
this
silent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
you
concede
the
issue
to
be
not
whether
the
rural
or
the
urban
areas
of
the
state
are
to
control
your
legislature,
that
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
just
state
what
is
the
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
basic
issue,
whether
these
appellants
and
all
other
people
in
the
state
of
colorado
have
proper
representation
as
individuals
regardless
of
whether
they
live
in
the
city
or
whether
they
live
in
the
country,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
so-called
liberals
or
so-called
conservatives,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
working
people
or
business
people,
isn't
that
the
basic
question
in
the
case,
are
these
appellants
and
everyone
so
situated
in
the
state,
entitled
to
the
same
kind
of
representation
in
your
legislature
which
makes
the
laws
under
which
they
must
live.
now,
if
that
isn't
the
issue,
tell
me
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that
is
not
to
be
the
issue,
and
if
that
is
not
to
be
the
result
who
has
the
power
to
say
that
one
shall
have
more
than
the
other
and
the
other
shall
have
less?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
said
who?
i'm
talking
about
who
has
the
right
now
to
weigh
this
thing
so
that
one
person
will
have
less
apportionment
representation
than
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
the
federal
constitution
is
interpreted
to
me
that
the
representation
means
equal
representation,
then
who
has
the
power
to
change
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
number
is
huerfano,
i
don't
find
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
25
and
30.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
take
two
other
districts,
both
very
small
districts,
both
in
the
neighborhood
that's
been
one
touching
denver
and
the
other
almost
touching
it.
numbers
13
to
14
boulder
county
and
districts
21
to
22
jefferson
county;
one
of
the
--
each
of
them
has
two
senatorial
districts,
but
one
of
them
has
a
senator
for
every
37,000
people
and
the
other
one
has
a
senator
for
every
63,000
people.
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
that
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
boulder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
one,
you
have
a
senator
for
every
37,000
people
in
boulder
county
and
a
senator
for
every
63,000
in
jefferson
county
immediately
next
door
to
it.
both
small
and
compact
in
the
area,
both
consisting
of
one
county
each.
why
that
differentiation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
one
instance,
you
tell
us
that
you
give
them
overrepresentation
because
it's
a
fastly
growing
community
and
then
another
situation
down
here
in
(inaudible),
you
say
you
give
them
overrepresentation
because
it's
a
dying
area
and
because
of
the
coal
industry
and
people
are
moving
out.
we
can't
have
both
of
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
we
give
them
another
county?
you
give
a
lot
of
other
places
counties
and
that's
a
very
small
district,
indeed
one
of
the
smallest
in
the
state
if
not
the
smallest
outside
of
denver.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hart.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
just
what
difference
that
made
in
the
constitution,
what
does
the
new
constitution
provide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
as
a
district
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
about
districts
13
to
14
and
21
to
22,
as
i
did
your
colleague,
those
are
both
in
the
vicinity
of
denver,
they
are
both
small
districts,
they
both
represent
one
county,
yet
you
give
a
senator
for
every
37,000
people,
and
in
the
other
county
one
senator
for
every
63,000.
why
should
that
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
haven't
you
done
that
with
districts
13
to
14,
37,127
people
per
senator
and
then
in
denver
61,736
per
senator.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
constitutional
distinction
between
a
vote
of
that
kind
by
the
people
and
the
same
proportionate
vote
by
your
legislature
in
a
state
where
they
don't
have
the
referendum
or
initiatives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hart
the
sentiments
of
the
public
change
very
rapidly
some
times.
suppose
you
had
in
your
state
a
wave
of,
let's
say,
liberalism,
or
a
wave
of
conservatism,
it
makes
no
difference
and
those
who
are
in
the
majority
of
that
way
of
thinking
put
a
major
on
the
ballot
and
did
exactly
what
you
have
done
here
for
the
purpose
of
perpetuating
that
particular
philosophy
of
theirs.
would
that
be
acceptable?
would
that
be
constitutional?
and
if
it
is,
could
another
group
coming
along
a
few
years
later
that
felt
the
other
way
say,
well,
we
will
do
it
just
the
opposite
of
that
and
we
will
keep
these
people
who
are
not
of
our
political
persuasion
from
having
a
full
weight
in
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
don't
we
get
down
to
the
fair
question
of
whether
this
is
in
conflict
and
not
whether
a
majority
of
your
people
voted
to
--
for
this
program
because
they
liked
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
only
point
that
we
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
not
mr.
hart,
thank
you.
mr.
ginsberg.
