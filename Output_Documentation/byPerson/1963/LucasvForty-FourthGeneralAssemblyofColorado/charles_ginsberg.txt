mr.
charles
ginsberg
honorable
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court.
i
have
listened
with
interest
to
the
various
arguments
presented.
while
reference
has
been
made
to
the
plan
advocated
by
our
opposition
and
the
plan
of
the
solicitor
general,
that
to
me
is
not
the
choice
here
to
be
made,
the
choice
is
a
plan
compatible
with
the
constitution.
the
plan
here
to
be
tested
falls
short
of
any
constitutional
requirements.
constitution
tries
to
give
weight
and
your
decisions
have
tried
to
give
weight
of
equal
value
to
all
voters.
that's
a
very
vital
and
important
right.
it's
not
dependent
upon
discrimination,
directed
at
any
group.
it's
never
to
give
a
same
weight
to
the
vote
of
each
citizen,
upon
every
issue
involving
the
federal
constitution,
most
certainly,
and
extending
to
the
question
of
state
rights
also.
gauged
by
that
test,
there
is
an
admitted
failure
in
the
state
of
colorado
to
any
measure
abide
by
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution.
we
have
a
lot
of
language
purporting
to
justify
that
violation.
in
one
case,
it's
impoverished
territory,
coal
mining
sections
that
have
been
abandoned.
in
another
case
it's
the
fact
that
some
other
interest
must
be
represented.
now,
it's
rather
silly
to
me
to
content,
for
one
to
do
justice
to
another
or
to
another's
interest
in
the
legislature
he
must
come
from
that
neck
of
the
wood
from
which
the
other
lives.
mr.
charles
ginsberg
well,
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
do
discourtesy
to
the
court.
i
would
assume
that
court's
knowledge
of
varying
interests
of
the
people
of
country
is
not
determined
upon
the
basis
of
the
judgment
acquired
in
any
given
territory
or
amongst
any
given
group.
i
am
sure
that
that
is
not
the
basis
for
your
considered
debate
on
this
court.
our
communications
are
not
so
limited
that
one
living
in
new
york
is
not
conversant
of
the
needs
of
colorado,
nor
for
that
matter
are
our
view
is
so
limited
by
environment
or
habitation
that
we
are
not
conversant
with
the
needs
of
the
world
today.
so
i
say
it's
putting
a
rather
narrower
limitation
upon
the
ability
of
a
legislature
to
function
in
the
interests
of
all
its
people,
because
they
are
not
divided
upon
the
basis
of
respective
trades.
i
think
that
question
was
suggested
by
honorable
justice
goldberg
in
one
of
his
questions.
is
a
legislature
made
up
of
urban
individuals
who
ignore
the
rights
of
their
neighbor
who
happens
to
be
located
in
the
farming
community?
neither
(inaudible)
is
the
interest
of
the
other.
there
hasn't
been
any
effort
to
justify
this
plan
upon
the
basis
that
it
in
any
way
approaches
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
it
flagrantly
does
not.
i
do
not
propose
to
measure
by
the
yardstick
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
don't
think
it
approaches
the
just
application
of
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
charles
ginsberg
no,
in
the
cases
declared,
as
i
understand
them,
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
ginsberg
well,
the
carr
case.
mr.
charles
ginsberg
well,
you
laid
down
--
your
recent
georgia
case
lays
down,
certainly
the
principle
as
nearly
as
possible,
a
man
to
vote,
nearly
as
possible
and
certainly
when
there
is
a
discrepancy,
where
in
one
locality
19,000
people
can
elect
a
senator
to
the
state
senate.
another
locality
it
is
60,000
or
more.
that
certainly
cannot
be
claimed
to
be
any
approach
to
my
understanding
of
baker
versus
carr
case.
certainly
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
gives
to
each
individual.
(inaudible)
on
the
most
basic
right
possessed
by
man,
the
right
to
vote,
and
that
is
the
purpose,
i
take
it,
of
this
court
on
this
vital
right,
to
find
as
nearly
as
possible
in
method
through
which
each
individual's
vote
is
equivalent
of
another.
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
this
court.
