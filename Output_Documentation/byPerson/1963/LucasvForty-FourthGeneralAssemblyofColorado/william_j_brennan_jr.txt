that
means
the
total
population
of
colorado,
33.2%
of
the
total
population
can
elect
20
senators.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
however
they
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
fact.
you
can
get
a
combination
of
33.2%
of
the
aggregate
population
that
selects
20
senators,
which
is
the
majority
of
the
senate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
you
are
saying
is
to
get
33
â€“
to
test
the
fact
necessarily
you
must
include
some
people
who
live
in
suburban
or
urban
areas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
mind,
is
there
an
explanation
for
putting
(inaudible)
together?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
looking
at
this
map
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
don't
know
you
place
that
well,
but
it
does
strike
me
that
most
of
it
seems
to
be
in
the
plain
there,
isn't
it,
and
the
valley
of
some
kind
on
the
other
side,
there
are
all
mountains.
there
are
lots
of
verges
on
this
map.
what
exactly
is
the
justification
for
combining
those
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
suggest
that
whatever
combination
you
made
up,
you
wanted
to
be
sure
to
continue
three
senators
down
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
real
reason
for
doing
it
this
way,
whatever
the
combinations
were,
that
you
wanted
to
perpetuate
three
senators
in
that
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
balancing
of
what
interest,
that's
what
i
don't
get?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
only
one
to
which
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what,
the
plan
is
applied
here
