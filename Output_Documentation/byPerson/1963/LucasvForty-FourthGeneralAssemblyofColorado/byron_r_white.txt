white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
real
point?
would
you
say
that,
this
is
invalid
if
state
of
colorado
decided
to
give
farmers,
assume
they
constitute
20%
of
the
population,
to
give
farmers
20
--
as
an
economic
group
20%
of
the
representation
in
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
think
proportional
representation
is
not
necessarily
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
principle
that
economic
interest
may
not
be
represented
–
it's
not
a
rationale
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
suggested.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
permit
at
least
districting
to
make
sure
the
district
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
zarlengo,
certainly
it
would
be
true,
no
matter
how
you
divided
the
state,
that
everybody
would
be
represented,
and
the
real
question
is
whether
to
what
extent
may
you
give
a
certain
hundred
thousand
people
more
representation
than
others.
you
--
no
matter
how
you
put
up
the
state,
everybody
is
going
to
have
a
representative.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
real
point
is
not
representation
but
effective
-–
justice
byron
r.
white
a
little
weighted
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
does
a
particular
area
need
a
weighted
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
way
to
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
way
this
reapportionment
plan
was
constructed
on
rural
-
urban
basis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
house
is
70%
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
senate
is
still
–
in
your
position
it
is
the
urban
votes
still
controls
the
senate,
a
majority
of
59%.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
zarlengo
(inaudible)
why
for
example,
if
you
put
the
(inaudible)
would
this
be
(inaudible)
why
did
you
feel
for
example,
that
cannon
city
and
cannon
city
areas,
is
there
a
senator?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
an
--
the
district
9
and
10.
so
is
district
25,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
they
have
got
in
one
business,
and
then
just
down
the
line
(inaudible)
and
all
through
south
park
up
to
fairplay
(inaudible).
now
this
is
one
of
the
point
that
the
district
general
for
example
takes
(inaudible).
now
what
is
the
rational,
excuse
or
the
justification
for
thinking
that
the
cannon
city
area
deserved
a
separate
representative?
your
point
is
that
you
are
trying
to
make
sure
that
all
the
state
is
represented,
all
the
interest
groups
are
represented.
now
tell
me
what
the
interest
is,
if
it
is
the
cannon
city
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
rational,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
take
that
this
was
one
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
like
to
hear
on
that
is
if
it
doesn't
take
a
big
study
to
ask
that
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
talk
about
that
district.
it
doesn't
take
a
big
study.
they
wondered
why
you
put
(inaudible)
in
the
same
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
how
(inaudible)
walsenberg
(inaudible)
now
if
they
--
if
you
have
rational
basis
for
the
disparity
in
these
districts
and
you
are
going
to
explain
(inaudible)
and
take
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
district
it
is,
i
will
go
by
district
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
huerfano
has
got
–
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
population
has
gone
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
put
walsenburg
and
trinidad
together,
and
put
(inaudible)
in
the
same
district
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
this
--
this
way
it
comes
out
like,
you
give
three
senators
in
that
southern
district,
that
southern,
we
can
give
three
senators.
the
question
is
why
is
it
that,
what's
rightful
about
it
when
the,
why
did
they
justify
three
senators
when
their
population
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
very
true,
absolutely
the
same
is
true
for
walsenburg,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that's
true
to
san
luis
valley?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
(inaudible)
a
depressed
area?
