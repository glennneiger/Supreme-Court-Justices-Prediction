mr.
stephen
h.
hart
cold
i
ask
the
marshal,
how
much
time
i
have
left?
42
minutes?
43,
thank
you!
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
conscious
of
the
value
of
this
court's
time
in
the
limits
of
mine,
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
still
place
the
case
in
focus.
there
are
lots
of
details
and
they
are
confusing
at
least
to
me,
not
as
confusing
happily
as
the
georgia
school
board
case
yesterday
because
they
are
all
in
the
record
here.
but,
referring
to
yesterday's
argument
at
least,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
this
colorado
case
starts
afresh
with
the
constitutional
amendment
adapted
by
the
people
in
1962.
prior
to
that
time
there
was
a
different
apportionment
system
in
colorado.
a
system
based
not
on
per
capita
ratios,
not
on
--
i
mean
not
on
per
capita
population,
but
on
ratios
in
which
for
instance,
a
district
for
the
senate
was
given
one
senator
for
the
first
19000
people
and
one
senator
for
subsequent
50000
people.
each
house
district
was
given
one
member
for
the
first
8000
people
and
the
second
member
for
the
first
20500
people.
it
was
this
ratio
system
which
dean
rogers
was
testifying
about
which
was
so
called
the
elihu
root
system
advocated
by
elihu
root
new
york
convention
of
1894
and
it
was
elihu
root's
theories,
not
dean
rogers's
theories
which
he
was
quoting
in
support
of
the
new
york
proposal
which
was
the
colorado
law
until
the
people
spoke
in
1962.
since
1962,
we
have
had
a
completely
new
provision
initiated
and
approved
by
the
people.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
it
makes
a
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference.
first,
it
got
rid
completely
of
the
ratio
principle
in
the
house.
it
provided
that
a
legislature
must
district
the
house
purely
in
accordance
with
population
and
not
in
accordance
with
these
ancient
ratios.
second,
it
puts
sanctions
on
the
house,
on
the
legislature
so
that
they
had
to
comply
with
this
constitutional
provision
which
they
had
rather
avoided
in
the
past.
it
put
those
sanctions
on
by
providing
that
if
they
didn't
immediately
redistrict
the
house
and
if
they
didn't
do
so
every
ten
years,
they'd
lose
their
pay
from
then
on
and
they
weren't
able
to
be
reelected.
they
couldn't
run
for
reelection.
that
was
effective.
in
the
third
place,
they
moved
closer
to
a
per
capita
representation
in
the
senate
than
they
had
ever
been
before.
they
added
four
new
senators,
those
to
the
four
most
rapidly
growing
areas
in
the
state,
the
suburbs
of
denver,
giving
each
of
those
four
counties
surrounding
denver
two
senators
in
all.
third
or
fourth,
they
provided
for
sub-districting
the
multi-senator,
multi-representative
districts
so
that
the
individual
voters
could
know
who
they
were
voting
for
and
would
be
able
to
choose
between
two
candidates
instead
of
as
it
was
in
denver,
34
candidates.
the
case
has
been
ably
argued.
we
have
presented
briefs,
which
i
think
are
good,
but
the
best
thing
of
all
in
this
case
is
the
transcript
of
testimony.
the
evidence
here
supplied
completely
by
our
appellees
is
from
very
distinguished
and
very
able
men.
senator
edwin
c.
johnson,
probably
colorado's
most
distinguished
and
most
experienced
office
holder
testified
at
length.
james
grafton
rogers,
certainly
one
of
colorado's
most
distinguished
educators
and
public
servant,
testified
at
length.
the
denver
research
institute,
a
branch
of
denver
university
supplied
a
study
which
was
impartial
objective,
and
supports
the
rationality
of
the
scheme.
if
the
appellants
are
to
prevail
here,
they
must
upset
all
of
the
testimony,
they
must
upset
the
findings
of
the
lower
court,
they
must
upset
the
vote
of
the
people,
they
must
upset
all
of
the
presumptions.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
that's
right.
if
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
if
the
holding
of
this
court
following
through
from
baker
v.
carr
requires
an
absolutely
arithmetical
apportionment
of
both
houses
of
a
bicameral
legislature,
there
is
nothing
to
it.
but
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
possible
to
apportion
both
houses
more
nearly
according
to
population
than
has
been
done
by
this
plan,
but
if
what
you
require
under
equal
protection
is
what
--
has
always
been
required
under
equal
protection
and
due
process,
something
more
arithmetical
equality
or
as
near
arithmetically
--
arithmetical
equality
as
you
can
get
rationality,
reasonableness,
reasonable
classifications,
fairness,
lack
of
arbitrary
classifications
we
submit
that
this
plan
meets
that
test.
we
submit
that
this
plan
is
rational;
all
the
evidence
so
indicates.
the
findings
of
the
court
are
to
that
affect
and
i
recommend
those
findings
it's
a
very
clear
statement
of
the
case.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
there
is
very
definite
explanation
for
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
asked.
the
geography
of
colorado
is
very
complex.
it's
a
rectangle
put
upon
the
most
complex
and
diverse
and
differentiated
geography
in
the
whole
united
states
outside
of
alaska.
this
central
area
is
an
area
of
tremendous
mountains.
there
are
53
peaks,
over
14,000
feet
high
in
this
area.
california
has
12;
washington
has
one.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
for
combining
huerfano
with
alamosa
was
a
matter
chiefly
of
attempting
to
balance
population.
if
huerfano
is
put
with
los
alamos,
as
the
solicitor
general
would
suggest,
that's
a
fairly
reasonable
classification,
but
then
in
order
to
balance
population
and
make
an
additional
senator,
you
have
to
put
alamosa
and
costilla
county
with
rio
grande,
conejos
and
mineral
counties.
conejos
has
something
in
common
with
alamosa
but
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
i
think
that
nothing
is
perfect.
i
think
that
had
the
people
of
colorado
voted
on
the
plan
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
i
don't
think
it
was
at
all,
i
think
it
was
a
balancing
of
the
various
interests.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
the
interests
on
the
west
side
of
district
31
are
largely
timber,
mining,
tourists,
recreation,
agriculture,
that
is
livestock.
the
interests
of
alamosa,
costilla
and
huerfano
county
are
largely
irrigated
farming,
coal
mining,
depressed
coal
mining,
and
similar
interests.
one
very,
very
important
factor,
and
one
which
is
in
support
of
this
particular
districting
is
the
heavy
unemployment
in
this
area.
this
is
a
continuously
depressed
and
an
increasingly
depressed
area
in
colorado.
the
central
southern
area
is
the
most
depressed;
the
heaviest
load
of
public
welfare,
the
heaviest
load
of
unemployment,
the
heaviest
load
of
aid
to
dependent
children
in
the
whole
state.
they
have
special
problems.
these
welfare
problems,
these
unemployment
problems
in
rural
areas
are
different
than
they
are
even
in
the
city.
they
require
representation.
i
admit
that
you
could
conceivably
cut
their
representation
from
three
senators
to
two
senators,
and
if
the
people
felt
that
was
fair,
that
would
be
all
right;
nothing
is
perfect.
this
is
the
most
debatable
area
of
the
colorado
plan,
but
i
submit
if
after
all
the
examination
that
has
gone
into
this
colorado
plan,
all
the
opposition,
all
of
the
legal
talent,
all
of
the
research,
the
only
thing
that
the
solicitor
general
can
come
up
with
to
object
to
is
this
little
area
of
persistent
unemployment
in
colorado,
if
all
they
want
to
do
is
to
take
one
senator
from
this
little
area
and
give
it
to
el
paso
county,
known
as
little
london
in
colorado,
because
it's
the
richest,
i
say
that's
de
minimis.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
the
second
is
this
district
z
above,
and
i
think
that
that
is
even
less
defensible.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
directly
above,
it's
a
combination
of
district
25
with
district
24,
it's
exactly
in
the
center
of
the
map.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
the
solicitor
general's
scheme
of
combining
those
two
districts
is
even
less
defensible
than
his
plan
of
combining
the
two
depressed
areas
on
the
border
of
new
mexico.
justice
white
quite
properly
asked
about
the
combination
of
canyon
city
and
salida.
canyon
city
and
salida
are
as
different
as
any
two
cities
in
colorado;
one
contains
the
state
penitentiary
and
a
high
level
of
state
employees,
who
are
interested
in
civil
service.
it
contains
a
great
area
of
coal
mines,
which
are
closed
down
and
high
unemployment.
salida,
the
capital
--
the
county
seat
of
chaffee
county
is
a
rapidly
growing
tourist
center.
it's
a
hub
of
highways,
it's
prosperous,
it's
growing.
there
is
every
reason
in
the
world
why
the
one
senator
would
find
it
difficult
to
represent
both
cities.
in
the
same
way
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
because
it
bears
on
the
balancing
of
the
whole.
if
you
gave
boulder
an
extra
senator,
then
the
three
--
the
four
suburban
counties
of
denver,
which
are
boulder,
adams,
arapahoe
and
jefferson,
would
have
more
senators
than
denver
itself,
and
yet
the
four
counties
together
have
less
population
than
denver.
there
the
--
if
there
are
conflicts
in
colorado,
and
it's
a
very
peaceful
state
generally,
but
if
there
are
conflicts,
the
worst
is
the
conflict
between
the
city
of
denver
and
the
surrounding
suburbs
in
the
field
of
annexation.
and
if
you
overweigh
the
suburb
and
counties
which
have
less
population
than
denver,
with
more
senators
than
denver,
you
are
going
to
put
denver
in
a
vice.
this
plan
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
you
have
done
it
on
a
per
senator
basis,
but
you
haven't
done
it
on
the
total
of
senators,
because
boulder,
the
one
that
you
refer
to,
is
a
suburb
of
denver,
so
listed
by
the
united
states
census,
and
the
four
suburban
counties
under
the
colorado
plan
have
8
senators,
denver
has
8
senators.
their
population
is
almost
even,
they
balance
each
other.
they
can't,
either
of
them,
ram
anything
down
in
each
other's
throat;
they
can't
rule
or
ruin.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
it's
about
35
miles
by
a
70-mile
an
hour
highway.
a
third
of
my
partners
live
in
boulder
and
practice
in
denver.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
it's
a
suburb
by
the
census
and
in
fact,
it's
practically
growing
up
all
the
way.
so
i
would
like,
again,
trying
to
put
this
in
perspective
to
state
my
position.
i
am
here
representing
the
interveners.
mr.
zarlengo
is
representing
the
state
of
colorado.
our
position
before
this
court
is
identical.
we
are
supporting
the
colorado
plan.
in
the
beginnings,
however,
our
position
was
quite
different.
the
attorney
general
from
the
prosecutor's
office
was
required
to
support
the
colorado
law
and
the
colorado
constitution.
we
differed
with
the
colorado
law
and
the
colorado
constitution
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1962
and
we
proposed
this
amendment,
which
accomplished
those
things
which
i
stated
at
the
beginning
of
my
remarks.
we
proposed,
initiated,
and
passed
through
--
by
the
elected
the
amendment
number
7.
having
passed
it,
we
are
here
to
defend
it.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
other
cases
that
you
have
heard
on
the
state
apportionment
matter.
in
the
first
place,
this
scheme
was
initiated
by
the
people
and
at
the
same
time
as
they
initiated
this
plan,
they
repudiated
a
contrary
plan,
which
was
along
the
lines
of
that
proposed
by
the
appellant,
and
they
did
it
overwhelmingly.
the
vote
of
the
people
for
the
colorado
plan,
for
number
7,
was
305,000:172,000,
almost
2:1
and
those
against
the
per
capita
plan
in
both
houses,
was
311,000:149,000,
more
than
double.
more
than
twice
as
many
people
voted
for
the
colorado
plan
as
voted
for
the
per
capita
plan.
what's
more
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
only
this
that
the
vote
by
the
people
is
that
much
more
direct,
the
vote
by
the
people
can
be
counted
per
capita,
it
can't
be
hidden
behind
the
personal
opinions
of
a
representative
who
may
depart
from
the
views
of
his
constituents.
this
plan
was
not
only
adopted
overwhelmingly
by
all
the
people
at
large
throughout
the
state,
it
was
adopted
by
the
people
in
every
single
county
of
the
state,
including
those
that
are
alleged
to
be
discriminated
against
and
the
opposing
plan
was
defeated
by
the
people
in
every
single
county
of
the
state,
including
those
who
are
alleged
to
have
been
discriminated
against.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
there
are
63
counties
and
the
votes
in
denver
and
suburbs
and
el
paso
and
every
other
county
that
is
supposed
to
have
been
discriminated
against
were
against
per
capita
representation
and
in
favor
of
this
plan.
the
reasonable
inference
from
that
is
that
they
felt
that
it
was
reasonable.
they
felt
that
it
represented
the
needs
of
the
people
of
colorado
and
that
the
other
plan
did
not.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
the
people
have
--
there
are
two
phases
of
that,
sir.
the
people
have
the
full
right
by
initiative
to
come
in
every
two
years,
any
two
years,
and
amend
this
plan
or
any
other
plan.
the
assertion
that
this
is
frozen
in
the
constitution
is
absolutely
contrary
to
fact.
the
people
and
the
people
alone
in
colorado
amend
the
legislature.
there
is
no
provision
for
amendment
by
the
general
assembly
whatsoever.
the
people
alone
do
it.
so
that
any
two
years,
any
general
election,
the
people
can
come
in
and
amend,
but
any
amendment
that
they
may
choose
obviously
cannot
be
in
contravention
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
we
do
get
to
that
point
and
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
the
only
point
is
the
constitutionality
of
this
plan,
but
the
essence
of
my
argument
is,
if
this
plan
were
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
on
the
basis
that
it's
a
discrimination
against
the
minority,
against
some
minority.
the
only
right
that
is
alleged
here
is
the
right
to
vote.
the
only
vote
involved
is
the
vote
by
senatorial
districts.
the
vote
by
senatorial
districts
is
a
vote
by
the
majority.
one
person's
vote,
unless
he
is
in
the
majority,
doesn't
count
in
the
united
states.
if
you
have
a
county
of
50,000
voters
and
26,000
vote
one
way
and
24,000
vote
another,
the
24,000's
vote
doesn't
count,
the
26,000's
vote
does.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
appellants
are
bringing
the
lawsuit.
presumably,
appellants
voted
in
the
last
--
in
this
initiative.
appellants
presumably
voted
in
denver.
appellants'
right
to
vote
was
not
discriminated
against.
they
went
into
the
polling
place
just
like
everybody
else.
their
vote
was
counted,
but
their
vote
didn't
win.
the
majority
of
the
voters
in
denver,
the
majority
of
the
voters
in
each
one
of
these
counties,
expressed
the
opinion
of
that
county.
in
the
majority
rule
system
that
we
have,
an
individual's
vote
does
not
count
unless
it's
part
of
a
majority.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
that
would
be
absolutely
invidious.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
that
would
be
invidious.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
that's
right.
the
vote
--
the
point
is
whether
the
provision
adopted
offends
the
constitution,
but
philosophically,
philosophically,
as
long
as
the
united
states
sticks
to
the
principle
of
the
majority
vote,
then
an
individual's
vote
is
significant
only
when
it's
on
the
side
of
the
majority,
and
the
majority
here
have
spoken
in
each
one
of
the
areas
that's
under
consideration.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
if
you
had
proportionate
voting
of
some
kind,
it
would
be
different,
and
the
individual's
vote
would
be
of
some
significance
if
he
lost,
but
in
this
country
if
a
senatorial
district
carries
by
only
one,
the
majority
prevails.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
here
all
the
majority
did
was
impose
temporarily,
until
the
majority
again
should
say
otherwise,
a
restraint
upon
itself.
the
majority
acted
with
full
knowledge,
well-informed,
and
with
two
alternatives
ahead
of
it.
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
this
court
can
overthrow
the
constitutionality
of
this
plan
if
it
so
holds,
but
the
majority
vote
of
the
people
does,
as
you
well-express,
bear
on
the
thing.
i
would
say
that
it
bears
in
four
ways.
one,
the
vote
of
the
people
are
well-informed
after
an
intensive
campaign
and
after
ten
years
of
study
and
debate,
after
two
prior
referred
measures,
certainly
indicates
their
view
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
plan.
in
the
second
place,
the
existence
of
the
initiative
stands
like
a
good
angel,
shall
we
say,
over
the
acts
of
this
legislature,
who
is
apportioning
your
considering,
because
everything
that
this
legislature
does
is
--
can
be
subjected
to
the
initiative.
it's
the
most
liberal
initiative
of
any
state
in
the
united
states,
except
north
dakota.
it's
more
liberal
even
then
california,
in
that
the
number
to
initiate
a
measure
is
8%
of
the
vote
for
secretary
of
state,
which
is
a
small
vote,
as
compared
to
8
for
governor,
which
is
a
larger
vote.
in
the
third
place,
the
presence
of
the
initiative
in
this
case
provides
a
remedy
whereby
the
people
at
any
time
they
are
dissatisfied
can
come
in
and
change
the
picture.
even
this
november,
there
is
plenty
of
time;
an
initiative
doesn't
have
to
be
filed
until
july
30.
four
months
before
the
election
appellants
can
go
in
there
with
any
plan
they
want,
put
it
up
to
the
people,
and
the
people
can
vote.
that
is
mr.
cox's
point
when
he
says
that
there
is
no
need
for
equity
to
intervene
here.
in
the
third
place,
there
is
the
matter
of
integrity
of
the
vote,
but
this
whole
series
of
cases,
beginning
with
baker
against
carr,
proves
is
--
or
is
aiming
at,
is
the
right
to
vote.
what
use
is
the
right
to
vote
--
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
thank
you!
continuing,
i
would
like
to
turn
afresh
to
the
plan
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
outlined
in
blue
on
the
map
which
he
furnished
you,
as
being
an
alternative
to
the
plan
adopted
by
the
people,
and
of
course
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
is
his
plan,
revised
in
washington,
2,000
miles
from
denver,
as
opposed
to
the
plan
adopted
by
the
people.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
not
just
the
inconsistencies
in
the
plan,
which
i
tried
to
develop
with
respect
to
huerfano
county
and
canyon
city,
but
also
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
achieve,
to
any
substantial
degree,
any
improvement
in
what
he
would
consider
the
discrepancies.
he
argues
now
that
33.2
of
the
people
can
elect
a
majority
of
the
senate.
under
his
plan
39%
of
the
people
could
elect
the
majority
of
the
senate.
the
ratio
of
the
least
populous
district
under
our
plan
to
the
most
populous
would
be
3.6:1;
under
his
it
would
be
3.3:1.
it
would
change
only
2%
of
the
seats
in
the
whole
legislature,
2
out
of
104,
or
in
the
senate
itself,
it
would
change
only
5%
of
the
seats
in
the
senate,
just
over,
2
out
of
39.
we
feel
that
this
is
de
minimis
and
not
substantial
enough
to
upset
the
vote
of
the
people
of
colorado.
i
would
like
in
the
same
vein
to
refer
to
some
other
statistics,
the
ratios
of
population
to
senators
under
the
colorado
plan.
there
may
be
the
impression
before
the
court,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
had
that
impression,
that
the
colorado
plan
gives
control
to
the
rural
areas;
it
does
not.
there
are
four
different
areas
in
the
state;
the
western,
the
eastern,
the
south
central,
and
the
eastern
slope.
the
eastern
slope
is
the
metropolitan
area
involved
in
any
discrimination,
if
there
were
one.
under
the
colorado
plan,
the
eastern
slope
has
75%
of
the
people.
it
would
have
23
senators
as
against
15
senators
for
the
rest
of
the
state.
it
would
have
47
senators
as
against
26
--
47
members
of
the
house
as
against
26
for
the
rest
of
the
state.
even
the
three
metropolitan
areas
of
colorado
springs,
denver,
and
pueblo,
would
still
have
42
out
of
63
in
the
house
and
20
out
of
39
in
the
senate.
the
three
metropolitan
areas,
excluding
the
rest
of
the
urban
eastern
slope,
would
still
control
both
houses.
if
you
take
urban
areas
as
a
whole
as
against
rural
areas,
and
there
are
urban
areas
in
other
parts
of
the
state,
senatorial
districts
electing
--
representing
predominantly
urban
population
would
have
24
senators
as
against
15
senators
from
districts
representing
predominantly
rural
populations.
one
other
point
with
respect
to
mr.
goldberg's
question,
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
property
rights
or
with
discrimination
against
religious
groups.
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
right
to
vote,
and
with
respect
to
the
right
to
vote,
i
submit
that
the
vote
of
the
people
is
peculiarly
persuasive.
the
vote
of
the
people
in
the
very
districts
involved
in
any
alleged
discrimination
should
be
given,
particularly
weight
in
this
instance,
and
i
quote
from
the
solicitor's
brief
on
page
27.
“any
relief
granted
to
those
who
requested
in
the
courts
will
unavoidably
be
forced
upon
those
who
rejected
it
at
the
polls.
under
such
circumstances
the
will
of
those
similarly
situated
and
necessarily
affected,
which
seemed
to
be
a
factor,
that
equity
should
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
to
intervene
or
to
stay
its
hand.”
i
say
more
than
in
just
deciding
whether
to
intervene
or
to
stay
its
hand,
it
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
considering
whether
or
not
this
is
rational
or
whether
or
not
it's
invidious.
i
might
also
mention
that
the
relief
which
the
people
of
the
state
of
maryland,
in
the
case
that
you
heard
in
november,
which
they
asked
for
is
exactly
the
relief
which
the
people
of
colorado
have
already
exercised.
in
the
maryland
case,
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
the
complainants,
asked
that
the
court
enjoin
the
defendants
from
performing
their
election
duties
until
such
time
as
the
general
assembly
should
submit
for
referendum
vote
by
eligible
state
voters
an
amendment
to
their
constitution
which
would
reapportion
the
membership
of
the
general
assembly
on
the
basis
of
population.
that's
exactly
the
referendum
which
was
submitted
to
the
people
in
colorado
and
exactly
what
they
turned
down
in
favor
of
this
plan,
which
was
submitted
at
the
same
time.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
state
what
i
was
about
to
say
just
before
the
intermission,
that
with
the
case
of
baker
against
carr,
this
court
initiated
a
very
far-reaching
inquiry
into
the
problem
of
the
right
to
vote
for
state
legislatures.
that
case
was
a
milestone
in
the
protection
of
the
right
to
vote.
both
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
and
of
the
solicitor
general
are
paeans
of
praise
in
favor
of
the
right
to
vote.
here
we
have
a
plan
which
is
the
result
of
that
vote.
it's
the
result
of
a
vote
statewide
in
which
every
man
had
an
equal
vote
and
it
can
be
broken
down
by
counties,
and
in
ever
county
a
man
had
an
equal
vote.
we
submit
that
the
protection
of
the
right
to
vote
is
of
very
little
avail
if
the
integrity
of
the
vote,
where
no
discrimination
against
the
minority
is
involved,
is
abridged.
thank
you.
are
there
any
questions?
mr.
stephen
h.
hart
i
wondered
if
there
were
any
questions?
