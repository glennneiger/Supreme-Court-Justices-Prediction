mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
view
of
the
government,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
issues
are
very
closely
balanced
and
difficult
in
the
sense
of
being
sure
about
what
is
the
just
result.
on
balance,
the
united
states
joins
the
appellants
in
urging
reversal.
although
the
grounds
we
take
seem
to
me
to
be
considerably
narrower
than
the
appellants
and
upon
one
issue,
our
agreement
with
them
is
at
least
qualified.
as
we
see
it,
there
are
two
questions
here.
on
the
merits
the
question
is
whether
the
colorado
apportionment
filed
in
the
senate
by
taking
the
legislature
as
a
whole
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
think
there
is
also
a
question
whether
the
bill
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
equity
without
deciding
the
merits,
a
question
which
was
not
in
any
of
the
previous
cases
that
were
argued
during
this
term,
with
respect
to
state
legislative
apportionment
and
which
is
here
because
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
present
apportionment
became
law
in
colorado.
it
was
adopted
not
only
by
a
majority
vote
of
people
of
colorado
in
1962
after
virtually
a
decade
of
discussion,
referenda
consideration
by
the
legislature
and
other
official
bodies,
but
it
was
adopted
by
a
majority
vote
in
each
and
every
county.
in
addition,
the
initiative
and
referendum
are
available
and
by
custom
apparently
more
available
than
in
some
places
to
change
it
and
we
think
that
this
does
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
equitable
relief.
departing
from
what
would
be
the
customary
practice,
i
would
like
the
court's
indulgence
to
discuss
the
merits
first
and
to
discuss
the
question
of
equitable
digression
second.
i
do
think
also
it's
unusual
that
it'll
make
argument
a
little
bit
clearer
if
i
may.
on
the
merits
as
we
see
it,
the
issue
can
be
narrowed
very
rapidly.
we
adhere
here
to
the
principles
advocated
in
the
previous
cases
in
our
briefs
in
the
previous
cases,
including
our
arguendo
assumption
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
always
require
per
capita
equality,
but
that
there
maybe
some
factors
that
will
justify
departure
from
that.
the
starting
point
therefore
in
our
analysis
in
this
case
as
in
the
others,
is
that
is
per
capita
representation
measured
by
that
test
that
the
plaintiffs
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
second
we
note
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
pattern
can
be
said
to
be
an
obvious
crazy
quotes
such
as
was
involved
in
baker
and
carr
or
the
maryland,
delaware
and
alabama
cases.
we
think
it
does
have
a
conceivable
reason
behind
it.
nor
can
it
be
said
we
think
that
the
criteria
upon
which
this
apportionment
is
based
are
contrary
to
any
express
constitutional
limitations
or
are
invidious
in
the
sense
that
race
or
religion
or
some
consideration
of
that
kind
is
invidious.
some
of
the
considerations
advanced
by
the
witnesses
and
taken
into
account
we
think
by
the
district
court
and
apparently
referred
to
in
the
briefs
strike
us
as
irrelevant
and
impermissible
in
the
sense
that
we've
used
that
term,
but
there
are
other
permissible
factors
also
cited
which
we
think
at
least
furnish
an
intelligible
basis
that
are
not
irrelevant
as
we
have
used
the
term
and
this
therefore
takes
the
case
out
of
our
third
rule
as
we
have
stated.
thus
in
our
view
the
case
comes
down
to
the
question,
a
question
of
degree
whether
the
variations
in
per
capita
representation
are
so
severe,
so
great,
as
in
relation
to
the
permissible
justifications
alleged,
as
that
they
can
be
called
arbitrary
and
capricious.
now
i
think
it
is
fairly
possible
to
narrow
the
argument
down
just
a
little
bit
further.
the
colorado
constitution
under
this
amendment
calls
for
apportionment
of
the
house
in
preparation
to
population
and
the
legislature
passed
the
bill
which
works
out
so
that
it
takes
and
to
get
a
numerical
majority
of
the
house,
it
takes
districts
containing
45%
of
the
population,
which
i
think
we
would
all
have
to
agree
is
pretty
good,
that
they
have
--
it's
conceded
conform
to
the
constitutional
requirement.
i
have
heard
it
suggested
that
whenever
one
house
of
the
legislature
is
apportioned
in
proportion
to
the
population
that
a
state
may
do
as
it
wishes
with
the
other
house.
no
such
claim
is
made
by
the
appellees
as
i
understand
their
argument,
although
i
suppose
they
would
be
glad
to
win
on
that
ground,
but
they
don't
urge
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
quite
right.
the
so
called
federal
analogy
as
we
have
suggested
before,
is
inappropriate
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place
history
is
entirely
different
and
i
needn't
elaborate
that
part.
in
the
second
place
of
course
under
the
colorado
apportionment
there
is
no
representation
of
the
counties
as
such.
there
are
some
counties
that
have
more
than
one
senator,
there
are
some
senatorial
districts
which
are
made
up
of
more
than
one
county,
and
i
might
suggest
also
in
view
of
a
question
for
mr.
justice
goldberg
earlier,
that
i
think
there
is
as
a
practical
matter
another
marked
difference
between
the
situation
of
state
and
the
situation
of
the
federal
government.
the
states
by
and
large
are
large
enough
so
that
they
contain
urban
and
rural
interest,
take
colorado
as
an
example,
denver
and
the
rest
of
the
state
and
this
is
pretty
generally
true
as
you
go
over
the
country,
so
that
the
senate
is
perhaps
indeed
are
strongly
representative
of
the
urban
interest,
whereas
you
come
to
break
down
to
the
size
of
senatorial
districts
in
a
state
like
colorado.
and
you
get
a
large
number
coming
from
areas
that
are
sheep
raising,
cattle
or
something
like
that
and
you
get
a
over
representation
by
the
per
capita
standard
i
think
really
of
territory
and
not
of
people
at
all
and
i
think
that
a
political
scientists
would
note
this
as
another
marked
difference
in
addition
to
the
ones
i
have
mentioned.
thus
narrowing
the
question
of
why
we
agree
that
the
per
capita
equality
in
the
house
tempers
the
inequality
in
the
senate,
we
think
the
question
remains
whether
the
overall
inequality
in
representation
in
the
legislature
is
so
out
of
proportion
to
the
justifications
as
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
will
start
there
in
the
morning.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
had
outlined
our
reasons
for
suggesting
that
on
the
merits,
this
case
comes
down
to
the
question,
whether
the
per
capita
inequalities
are
so
severe,
so
serious
in
relation
to
any
permissible
objective
that
they
might
be
thought
to
attain
as
to
constitute
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
let
me
first
say
a
word
about
the
inequalities
themselves.
the
basic
figures
that
pertain
to
the
senate
are
most
conveniently
set
forth
in
this
case
i
think
in
appendix
c
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
of
course,
appears
in
the
back
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
they
begin
on
page
74
run
over
for
a
few
additional
pages.
we
attempted
to
relate
them
to
geography
by
this
map
that
i
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
yesterday,
which
preserves
the
numbering
of
the
districts
as
they
are
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
which
shows
their
size
and
shape
and
also
the
average
number
of
people
per
senator
in
each
district
and
the
population
of
each
county.
finally,
it
maybe
helpful
to
point
out
one-third
document,
then
i
think
court
will
know
what
they
all
are,
in
this
blue
volume,
which
is
the
appellees'
exhibit
d,
there
is
a
useful
topographical
map
on
the
inside
of
the
back
cover.
i
am
not
going
to
ask
your
honors
to
follow
all
three
at
once,
but
you
may
find
it
useful
in
your
study
of
the
case
in
chambers.
the
inequalities
run
most
severely
against
el
paso
county,
which
appears
on
our
map
as
districts
11
and
12
just
to
the
right
of
the
middle.
now
that
contains
the
colorado
springs
area
and
there
you
will
note
that
there
is
one
senator
for
each
71,000
people.
at
the
other
extreme
is
district
23,
las
animas
county,
which
is
down
on
the
right
bottom
of
colorado,
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
center,
where
you
will
note
that
there
is
one
senator
for
19,000,
almost
20,000
people,
the
ratio
versus
el
paso
county
being
3.5:1.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
five
counties
that
have
more
than
three
times
the
per
capita
representation
of
a
person
living
in
el
paso
county.
there
are
three
counties
that
have
three
times
the
representation
of
a
person
living
in
jefferson
county
which
is
in
the
center
of
the
state
right
next
to
denver
and
which
of
course,
is
a
suburb
of
denver.
denver,
the
little
dot,
almost
in
the
middle
which
we've
identified
by
a
line
as
district
28
has
only
half
the
per
capita
representation
of
the
people
in
seven
counties.
the
result
of
these
comparisons,
and
of
course,
the
court
will
want
to
study
them
is
a
very
striking
departure
from
equality
and
the
principle
of
majority
rule.
a
numerical
majority
of
the
colorado
senate
can
be
elected
from
counties
containing
less
that
one-third
of
the
people
of
colorado.
denver
and
the
three
adjacent
counties,
those
touching
upon
it,
plus
pueblo,
and
colorado
springs
have
in
excess
of
63%
of
the
population
and
less
than
a
majority
of
the
senate.
i
would
emphasize
in
addition
that
these
imbalances
are
getting
worse.
of
course,
the
case
must
be
judged
as
of
today,
but
nevertheless
we
are
dealing
as
it
were
with
things
in
motion,
like
in
airplane.
the
imbalance
for
example
on
the
figures
for
january
1964
is
such
that
now
it
takes
only
a
little
over
31%
of
the
counties
having
only
a
little
over
31%
of
the
population
to
elect
a
majority
of
the
people.
denver
and
its
suburbs
today
have
a
majority
of
the
population
and
only
14
out
of
39
senators,
hardly
more
than
one-third.
with
that
general
picture
in
mind,
i
turn
to
the
objectives
that
are
said
to
justify
this
lack
of
per
capita
equality.
some
of
them
as
mr.
creamer
pointed
out
yesterday
are
plainly
impermissible.
they
are,
if
they
were
the
basis
of
the
distinctions
alone,
one
could
call
them
invidious
discrimination.
for
example,
the
opinion
below
seems
to
adopt
the
view
expressed
by
the
witness
rogers
and
one
of
the
other
witnesses,
that
voters
who
lived
in
heavily
populated
areas
aren't
worth
as
much
as
voters
who
live
in
the
country.
that
it
seems
is
clearly
an
impermissible
ground
for
differentiation
as
we've
argued
in
the
other
cases
and
as
we
think
gray
and
sanders
clearly
held.
again,
it
seems
to
us
that
balancing
the
economic
interests
of
different
parts
of
the
state
is
a
plainly
impermissible
consideration,
for
reasons
that
mr.
creamer
very
well
stated
and
that
i
will
attempt
to
repeat.
i
say
just
word
about
them.
appellees
say
that
this
is
simply
a
play
upon
words,
that
the
senators
aren't
representing
economic
interest,
they
are
representing
people,
and
of
course,
that's
true,
but
we
submit
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
represent
people
of
one
economic
group,
any
differently
from
people
of
another
economic
group.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
colorado
had
a
legislature,
such
as
that
in
the
weimar
republic,
where
the
effort
was
to
represent
not
geographical
district
but
economic
classes
then
provided
each
economic
class
were
given
its
per
capita
weight.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
have
no
objection.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
certainly
wouldn't
argue
that
it
is,
no
principle
we
are
advocating
here
suggested
it
is,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
well
i
suppose
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
spoke
too
elliptically.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
a
man
because
he
is
a
farmer
may
not
be
given
twice
or
three
times
or
five
times
the
per
capita
representation
of
another
man
or
a
woman
because
she
is
a
suburban
householder,
anymore
than
a
protestant
maybe
given
more
representation
than
a
jew.
now,
i
would
distinguish
mr.
justice
white
and
we'll
deal
with
this
in
a
moment,
between
putting
a
legislature
together
so
that
there
are
people
familiar
with
the
diverse
economic
interests
of
the
state
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
legitimate
consideration.
it's
(inaudible)
of
people.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
not
only
that
but
as
we
tried
to
suggest
in
our
briefs,
we
think
there
are
reasons
to
trying
to
keep
districts
small
and
considerations
like
that,
that
cut
against
it.
and
so
here,
we
think
there
have
been
mentioned
a
number
of
considerations
that
at
least
do
go
in
the
direction
of
supporting
this
apportion.
if
i
were
stating
them
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i'd
say
that
among
the
permissible
objectives
are
to
try
and
keep
the
senate
a
small
enough
body
to
be
deliberated.
colorado
has
always
had
a
small
senate.
that
another
desirable
objective
and
a
permissible
one
is
to
have
the
senators
familiar
with
their
districts
and
the
people
in
the
districts
are
readily
familiar
with
the
senators
which
requires
trying
to
keep
them
smaller
area
and
it
requires
bearing
in
mind
considerations
of
accessibility
which
sometimes
cause
strange
shapes
in
a
state
like
colorado.
again,
i
would
argue,
if
i
were
supporting
with
saying
what
can
be
said
here
for
their
side
of
the
case,
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
following
county
lines
because
they
have
some
political
significance
independent
of
the
senatorial
district.
and
that
is
a
fact
which
we
would
say
maybe
taken
account
of
in
the
districting
and
which
may
compel
some
divergence
from
strict
per
capita
representation
which
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
to
be
permissible.
our
difficulty
in
this
case
is
that
when
all
that
has
been
said,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
won't
justify
the
apportionment
for
two
reasons.
mr.
creamer
dealt
with
one
of
them
and
i
simply
refer
to
what
he
said.
we
think
that
the
opinion
below
greatly
overemphasizes
the
problems
of
accessibility
and
shape
and
size,
and
greatly
underemphasizes
the
importance
of
being
equally
represented
in
the
legislature.
our
second
objection
is
that
we
think
the
arguments
are
insufficient
here
on
the
whole
because
all
those
objectives
which
we
assume
to
be
permissible
can
be
substantially
achieved
without
creating
inequalities
anywhere
nearest
areas
as
those
that
exist
here.
and
we
say
that
to
create
severe
discrimination
in
a
way
unnecessary
to
achieve
the
only
permissible
objectives
that
i've
mentioned,
plainly
unnecessary
to
achieve
it,
is
arbitrary
in
this
field
and
capricious
and
therefore
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
we
suggested
two
ways
in
which
the
objectives
could
be
attained
in
our
brief.
the
simpler
of
the
two,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
minute
to
suggest
with
the
help
of
a
map.
down
in
this
very
center
at
the
bottom
of
the
map,
is
district
30
with
one
senator
for
22,000
and
some
people,
one
of
the
most
overrepresented
districts
in
the
state.
now
we
can
see
no
reason
that
that
district
shouldn't
be
split
along
the
line
of
the
blue
line.
there
can
be
no
topographical
objection
that
follows
the
ridge
of
the
sangre
de
cristo
mountain
range
until
it
drops
south,
it
follows
county
lines,
and
neither
of
the
resulting
districts,
31
or
23
as
they
are
now
numbered,
taking
out
the
line
with
the
blue
z
on
it,
would
be
excessive
either
in
population
or
in
size.
indeed
there
are
other
districts
which
are
bigger
than
the
other
would
be
and
neither
would
have
in
access
to
which
(inaudible).
that
would
save
one
senator.
we
point
out
second
right
in
the
middle
of
the
map,
that
if
the
line
between
districts
24
and
25
were
removed
and
those
two
were
added
together,
you
would
have
a
district
with
40,000
people,
just
a
little
under
the
theoretically
perfect
number
for
a
senator,
the
area
again
would
not
be
the
biggest
in
the
state.
it's
a
little
large
but
not
out
of
proportion
with
the
others.
communications,
judging
from
the
roads
and
the
flow
of
traffic
is
quite
accessible.
the
difference
between
the
two
most
distant
points
is
less
than
the
differences
than
the
distances
between
the
two
most
distant
points,
and
some
other
counties
of
equally
rough
if
not
rougher
terrain
and
this
too
seems
to
be
an
obvious
simple
way
of
less
than
inequality.
now
this
would
free
two
senators.
if
one
were
given
to
el
paso
county,
the
people
in
that
county
which
are
now
the
most
underrepresented,
instead
of
having
60%,
63%
of
what
they
should
have,
would
have
almost
the
ideal
representation,
a
little
under.
if
the
other
were
given
to
denver
county,
the
people
of
denver
county
instead
of
having
73%
of
what
they
ought
to
have
would
have
an
excess
of
80%.
appeelles
in
their
reply
brief
rather
pull
this
and
say
well,
that's
just
two
senators
out
of
a
legislature
of
in
excess
of
100
members,
i
suggest
that
the
proper
comparison
is
with
the
total
size
of
the
senate
39
and
that
a
shift
of
two
senators
in
a
39-man
senate
may
make
a
very
great
difference
indeed
and
this
i
used
to
--
i
hope
i
used
them
fairly
bear
this
out.
instead
of
having
less
than
a
third
of
the
people
elective
majority
of
the
senate
it
would
take
a
minimum
of
40%,
counties
having
40%
of
the
people,
a
much
better
figure.
denver
and
the
three
adjacent
counties
plus
el
peso
and
pueblo
now
have
almost
64%
of
the
population
and
only
18
out
of
39
senators.
this
would
give
them
a
majority
in
the
senate.
put
still
another
way
are
the
change
of
just
these
two
would
substantially
improve
the
representation
of
37%
of
the
people
of
colorado
and
i
submit
that
it
would
sacrifice
non
of
the
objectives
that
the
appeellees
say
they're
seeking
to
obtain
or
certainly
not
substantially
(inaudible).
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
little
over
40%
would
elect
the
numerical
(inaudible).
the
important
point
of
course
is
not
that
one
of
us
can
draw
what
we
think
is
a
better
apportionment.
the
important
point
is
that
if
it
is
that
easy
to
make
so
substantial
a
change
in
the
direction
of
more
equal
per
capita
representation
then
it
shows
that
these
imbalances
go
way
beyond
anything
that
could
be
deemed
reasonably
necessary
to
achieve
their
objectives
and
that
we
submit
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
this
important
area.
now
i
would
like
hurrying
on
because
of
the
shortage
of
time
to
take
just
a
minute
on
the
other
issue
in
the
case.
we
suggested
that
there
is
a
real
question
here
as
to
whether
the
bill
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
equity.
we
recognize,
indeed
we
urge
most
strongly
that
the
political
picket,
the
phrase
sometimes
mentioned
in
this
connection
is
clearly
not
a
reason
alone
for
dismissing
a
bill
for
want
of
equity,
and
that
has
been
clearly
decided
in
the
wesberry
case,
and
we
take
that
as
a
premise.
this
case
does
have
some
very
unusual
circumstances.
this
is
not
an
ancient
apportionment
as
in
so
many
cases;
the
issue
was
debated
for
10
years
in
colorado.
this
apportionment
was
approved
in
each
and
every
county
by
a
majority
of
the
voters.
and
the
initiative
and
referendum
are
also
invoked
as
a
political
ribbon.
now,
we'd
urge
first
that
the
mere
fact
of
majority
approved
of
an
apportionment,
even
a
current
apportionment
is
not
a
reason
for
dismissing
a
bill
for
want
of
equity
automatically
and
we
have
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
equal
protection
clause
is
designed
to
protect
the
minorities
and
to
take
a
case
like
baker
and
carr
or
a
case
like
the
virginia
case
to
say
that
a
majority
of
the
people
like
to
discriminate
grossly
against
those
who
live
in
arlington
county
or
the
city
of
norfolk
plainly
won't
justify
it,
nor
would
it
justify
such
a
(inaudible).
and
our
second
reason
is
that
a
majority
vote
to
approve
a
particular
apportionment
must
be
looked
at,
must
be
scrutinized
very
carefully,
because
what
may
have
been
done
is
that
the
people
may
simply
have
thought
well,
this
is
an
awful
lot
better
than
what
we
had
before.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
am
just
trying
to
lay
the
ground
work,
and
i'm
going
to
indicate
that
they
have
a
stronger
case
on
two
points
here
and
those
two
points
of
course
mr.
justice
stewart,
are
first
that
this
wasn't
simply
a
majority
vote
of
the
state
as
a
whole.
this
was
a
majority
vote
in
each
county.
again,
i
would
say
that
was
immaterial
in
dealing
with
most
individual
constitutional
rights.
your
honors,
heard
me
discuss
on
this
at
some
length
on
monday.
to
translate
what
i
said
then
to
the
field
of
voting,
i
take
it
that
if
a
majority
of
the
citizens
of
mexican
descent
voted
in
colorado,
that
no
mexican
that
should
be
permitted
to
have
a
ballot,
that
still
any
individual
mexican
who
wished
to
complain
could
complain,
but
the
right
to
equal
representation
is
a
necessity
i
think,
a
shared
right.
there
is
no
way
and
quite
some
of
the
people
of
denver
county,
some
of
the
people
that
the
appellants
represent
can
have
equal
representation
without
all
the
people
of
the
constituent
units
have
an
equal
representation.
and
i
must
acknowledge
that
the
result
can
be
said
here
to
be
that
the
plaintiffs,
or
can
be
argued
to
be
that
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
force
on
the
class
they
represent,
something
that
a
majority
of
that
class
can
be
argued
to
have
rejected
their
proposal.
now
i
think
it's
a
little
harder
than
that
because
it
isn't
quite
fair
i
think
to
say
here
that
people
of
each
county
rejected
equal
representation
in
favor
of
the
present
apportionment
because
there
were
three
differences,
justice
stewart,
you'll
recall
between
the
plans.
one
was
that
difference,
another,
the
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
difference
is
that
the
amendment
number
7
which
gave
rise
to
this
plan
did
lay
out
the
district
line
so
far
as
the
combination
of
counties
were
concerned,
whereas
amendment
number
8,
the
rival
did
not.
and
probably
more
important
than
that,
amendment
number
7
called
for
districting
within
the
multi-senator
counties
and
multi-representative
counties,
whereas
this
district
number
8
called
for
electing
them
at
large
subject
to
some
rather
complicated
machinery
for
subsequent
districting.
so
we
can't
be
sure
how
far
the
vote
especially
in
the
populous
counties,
turned
on
one
of
those
other
issues
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
important
factor
to
bear
in
mind.
one
of
the
other
elements
entering
into
the
question
whether
equity
should
exercise
its
discretion
to
dismiss
the
bail
without
going
farther
is
the
initiative
in
referendum.
i
would
say
again
that
that
certainly
cannot
be
regarded
as
conclusive
in
all
cases
for
the
reasons
i
stated
with
reference
to
the
adoption
of
a
form
of
apportionment.
on
the
other
hand,
here
it
is
freely
available,
if
those
who
are
complaining
not
only
might
get
their
way
by
testing
this
issue,
but
at
least
to
the
minimum,
they
might
show
whether
it
is
true
or
not
true
that
the
people
of
each
county
like
it
the
way
it
is.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
factor
in
the
scale.
whether
those
are
enough
to
overcome
the
very
real
bias
pressure
to
decide
cases
which
is
ordinarily
the
court's
duty,
seems
to
me
a,
so
nice
a
question
that
we
have
thought
that
the
final
outcome
turned
on
still
one
other
far
most
consideration
and
that
is
the
theory
and
the
extent
of
the
harm,
that
the
plaintiffs
say,
that
has
been
done
to.
i
emphasize
both
the
theory
and
the
extent,
if
any,
of
the
harm
and
we
would
draw
here
in
our
brief,
as
perhaps
the
court
will
recall,
a
rather
nice
distinction.
we
say
that
to
the
extent,
the
plaintiffs
have
two
possible
theories.
one
is
the
one
i've
discussed,
that
although
there
is
some
room
for
deviation
per
capita
apportionment,
this
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
their
second
theory
is
that
the
per
capita
is
required
by
the
--
per
capita
equality
is
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
reference
to
anything
else.
their
first
theory
as
a
theory,
we
of
course,
diverged
in
other
cases
and
we
hope
that
by
the
time
this
case
is
decided,
that
will
be
a
clearly
established
constitutional
principle.
and
all
it
would
remain
then
is
the
question
of
degree,
the
niceness
of
the
question
of
degree
seems
to
us
not
a
reason
sufficient
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plaintiffs
can't
make
the
case
out
on
that
theory,
we
think
they
can,
but
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
this,
then
we
would
think
that
any
other
theory
was
sufficiently
tenuous
and
any
possible
remaining
harm,
damage
if
any,
was
not
great
enough
to
overbalance
the
considerations
on
the
other
side
and
so
we
urge
that
the
court
should
decide
the
case
on
the
merit
only
because
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
made
upon
the
first
theory.
thank
you.
