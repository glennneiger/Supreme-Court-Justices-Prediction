do
you
inject
an
ambiguity
and
you
say
that
it
was
more
accessible
to
rodents
that
it
should
have
been?
what's
your
standard
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there
had
been
a
trial
of
the
duty,
the
sort
of
charge
would've
been
sufficiently
charged
if
they
could
find
him
guilty
by
quoting
the
language
of
the
charge
that
calls
the
number
of
bags
of
said
food
to
be
held
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
rodents
and
birds,
insects
and
did
cause
the
food
to
be
exposed
to
contamination
by
rodents,
birds,
and
insects?
would
that
be
a
good
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they'd
have
to
prove
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
holding
it
but,
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
get
it.
i
don't
quite
understand
why
they
can't
permit
the
offense
of
holding
it
if,
by
hoarding
it,
they
cause
it
be
exposed
to
contamination,
the
same
as
all
the
--
certainly,
while
moving
it,
they
do
that.

that
afternoon
would
be
met
by
--
it
could
be
properly
raised
what
you're
raising
and
focusing
on
now
after
trial
and
the
court
has
charged
the
jury.
i
would
think
that
you
would
not
be
required
to
give
it
a
technical
construction
that,
such
as
you
indicate,
it
should
be
given.
justice
hugo

how
do
we
know
--
how
do
we
know
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
it
couldn't
have
been
made
inaccessible
to
rats?
aren't
some
buildings
rat-proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
maybe
not,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
hardly
--
that
would
hardly
one
bird
could
glide
through
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
it
might
not
be
enough
to
terminate
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
be
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
filed
a
bill
or
asked
for
a
bill
of
particulars?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
could
easily
do
that,
of
course.
i'm
just
wondering
if
this
is
--
this
isn't
a
broad
enough
or
narrow
enough
information
to
justify
the
case
going
to
trial
and
having
these
issues
tried
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
involved
somewhat
in
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
argument
you
make.
