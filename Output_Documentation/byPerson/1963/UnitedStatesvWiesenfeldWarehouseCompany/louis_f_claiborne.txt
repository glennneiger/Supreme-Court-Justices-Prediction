mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
a
district
court
judgment
dismissing
an
information
filed
under
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
of
1938
as
amended
in
1948.
the
information
charged
the
appellee
wiesenfeld
company,
with
violations
of
section
301
(k)
of
the
act,
which
among
other
things
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
do
any
act
with
respect
to
food
which
has
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
and
which
is
held
for
sale
which
results
in
the
food
becoming
adulterated.
specifically
it
was
charged
that
the
wiesenfeld
company
a
public
warehousing
firm
in
jacksonville,
florida
stored
certain
foods
which
had
been
shipped
from
louisiana
or
arkansas
and
illinois
in
a
building
which
was
accessible
to
rodents,
birds,
and
insects
and
otherwise
caused
the
foods
to
be
exposed
to
contamination
by
rodents,
birds,
and
insects.
but
this
amounted
to
a
holding
of
the
food
under
insanitary
conditions
and
that
the
fed
--
that
the
food
in
fact
became
contaminated
by
the
leavings
of
the
rodents,
birds,
and
insects.
the
food
involved
was
rice,
breading
mix,
and
hamburger
mix
packaged
in
bags,
presumably
paper
or
cotton
bags.
the
information
doesn't
specify.
there
were
six
counts
in
the
information,
each
charging
the
same
offense
with
respect
to
a
particular
lot
of
one
of
the
commodities.
each
count
charged
the
contamination
of
several
bags
of
the
food
stubs
involved.
the
first
four
counts
charged
acts
done
in
specified
periods
before
august
1961.
for
last
two
counts,
charged
similar
acts
done
with
respect
to
the
period
july
24,
1961
through
the
beginning
of
december
in
the
same
year.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
information
on
the
ground
that
the
statute,
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
did
not
reach
the
mere
holding
of
goods
under
insanitary
conditions.
the
court
conceded
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1958
amendments
would
seem
to
support
the
government's
position
but
the
court
thought
that
the
text
of
the
provision
was
insufficiently
clear
and
that
to
construe
it
broadly,
as
the
government
urged,
would
make
it
unconstitutionally
vague
and
indefinite.
it
would
seem,
therefore,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
was
whether
section
301
(k)
of
the
act
intends
to
reach
a
mere
holding,
as
the
district
court
termed
it,
of
food
under
insanitary
conditions.
whether
that
was
the
intent
of
congress,
and
if
so,
whether
congress
spoke
its
mind
sufficiently
clearly
in
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
objection.
that
was
the
issue
which
the
government
raised
in
its
appeal
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
we
address
in
our
brief.
but,
if
i
rightly
understand
the
appellee's
brief
in
this
court,
that
basic
question
is
no
longer
in
controversy.
they
seem
to
concede
that
the
act
--
the
particular
provision
of
the
act
does
indeed
proscribe
holding
of
food
under
insanitary
conditions.
they
couldn't
very
well
dispute
it.
the
act
expressly
proscribes
any
act
which
results
in
adulteration.
the
legislative
history
of
1958
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
storing
in
a
warehouse
is
such
an
act.
the
text
of
the
provision
itself
when
read
in
conjunction
with
other
provisions
of
the
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
a
holding
is
one
of
the
acts.
this
court's
decision
in
the
sullivan
case
makes
it
clear
that
there's
no
limiting
interpretation
suggested
by
the
initial
words
of
the
provision.
as
to
that
point,
since
it
seems
to
be
conceded,
we
leave
it
to
our
brief
which
is
very
short.
but,
after
conceding
this
basic
proposition,
the
appellee,
it
seems
to
us
at
least,
tries
to
raise
three
subsidiary
issues.
the
first
of
which
is
whether
the
holder,
the
warehouseman
in
this
case,
must
have
knowledge
of
the
insanitary
condition
of
the
place
where
he
stores
the
food.
the
second
question
is
whether
a
building
which
is,
in
the
words
of
the
information,
accessible
to
rodents,
birds,
and
insects
is
an
insanitary
place.
and,
finally
--
thirdly,
whether
the
statute
reaches
a
public
warehousemen
who
does
not
own
the
food
he
stores.
i'll
consider
each
of
these
questions
in
time.
as
to
the
first
one,
the
question
of
guilty
knowledge,
here,
we
have
to
make
a
small
concession
of
error.
the
appellee
notices
in
our
brief
a
reference
to
holding
under
known
insanitary
conditions.
that
was
an
inadvertence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
page
10,
your
honor,
just
before
the
beginning
of
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
no
one
should
be
deleted,
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page
at
page
10,
we
say,
holding
under
known
insanitary
conditions.
but,
this
is
largely
a
false
issue
in
any
case.
as
a
practical
matter,
we
suppose
that
the
warehouseman
knows
whether
or
not
his
building
is
insanitary.
at
the
very
least,
he
can
readily
discover
whether
it
is.
if
the
statute
imposes
a
special
duty
of
care
on
the
warehouseman
to
make
regular
inspections,
that
is
not
the
excessive
burden.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
his
second
issue,
as
i
put
it.
it's
the
appellee's
position
is
that
every
such
building
is.
we
are
in
no
position
to
debate
the
abstract
question
whether
science
has
perfected
a
method
of
keeping
all
rodents,
all
birds,
and
all
insects
out
of
warehouses.
we
do
know
that
warehouses
can
be
made
more
or
less
rat
proof,
perhaps
all
together
bird
proof,
and
somewhat
insect
proof.
the
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
--
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
food
stubs,
at
least
those
which
are
packaged
in
paper
bags
and
cotton
bags
and
which
are
therefore
particularly
accessible
to
or
inviting
to
the
rodents
and
insects,
can
be
segregated
from
the
other
foods
and
special
care
can
be
taken
to
prevent
whatever
rodents
or
insects
do
penetrate
the
warehouse
from
penetrating
this
special
area.
there
are
methods
of
fumigation
of
insecticides
which
can
control
these
pests
even
if
they
must
enter
the
building
itself.
in
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
six
counts.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
for
a
first
offense,
the
maximum
penalty
is
$1,000
or
one
year
as
imprisonment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
is
a
corporate
defendant.
incidentally,
in
my
study
of
prosecution
similar
to
this
for
seven
months
of
the
past
year,
and
when
i
say
similar
i
mean
prosecutions
in
cases
where
the
person
storing
food
is
charged
with
violating
the
act
because
he
held
it
in
a
building
accessible
to
rodents
or
other
pests.
there
were
31
such
cases
in
the
period
of
seven
months.
the
penalties
actually
imposed,
either
on
a
plea
of
guilty
or
as
a
result
of
the
verdict,
in
no
case,
involved
actual
imprisonment.
there
were
some
suspended
sentences.
there
were
a
great
many
fines.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
are
a
great
many
cases
in
which
the
corporate
offices
are
also
individual
defendants.
in
this
case,
however,
the
only
defendant
is
the
corporation
itself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
some
extent,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
that
the
pure
food
laws
as
a
whole
do
have
something
of
that
effect.
in
smith
versus
california
or,
quite
recently,
in
361
u.s.,
in
distinguishing
the
standard
--
the
constitutionally
permissible
standard
in
first
amendment
cases
and
in
this
sort
of
case,
the
court
noticed
that,
i
quote
from
page
152
of
that
opinion,
“the
public
interest
in
the
purity
of
its
food
is
so
great
as
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
highest
standard
of
care
on
distributors.
in
fact,
an
absolute
standard
which
will
not
bear
the
distributor's
plea
as
to
the
amount
of
care
he
has
used.
there
is
no
specific
constitutional
inhibition
against
making
the
distributors
of
food
to
speak
his
senses
of
their
merchandise.”
the
same
rationale,
it
seems
to
me,
lies
with
the
dotterweich
opinion
and
the
sullivan
opinion.
but,
here,
we
do
not
construe
the
statute
as
imposing
an
absolutely
strict
liability.
one
might
read
the
statute
as
warning
a
warehouseman
that
whenever
he
took
in
food
that
was
likely
to
be
attacked
by
rodents
or
other
pests,
he
did
so
all
together
at
his
risks.
and,
if
in
fact
the
warehouse
could
not
be
made
rodent-free
or
pest-free,
his
only
alternative
was
to
refuse
to
store
the
food,
perhaps
ultimately
forcing
the
manufacturer
to
package
the
product
in
a
different
way.
after
all,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
consumer
who
is
to
be
guaranteed
food
which
has
not
been
contaminated.
but,
we
read
the
statute
and
the
information
in
this
case
simply
to
require
that
all
possible,
reasonable
measures
be
taken
to
make
the
building
as
inaccessible
to
pests
as
is
possible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
some
is
--
that
may
be
one
reading,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
suggest
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
add
before
the
word
“inaccessible”
to
rodents,
to
interpret
that
to
mean
more
accessible
than
it
could
have
been.
i
also
point
out
that
the
indictment,
being
in
six
counts
and
charging
the
contamination
of
several
bags
of
each
of
the
food
stubs
involved,
indicates
more
than
the
penetration
of
one
or
two
or
a
few
pests
because
the
evidence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
saying
that,
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
this
indict
--
this
information,
seems
to
me,
doesn't
purport
to
charge
anything
more
than
a
lack
of
taking
all
possible
precautions.
the
standard
of
care
may
be
very
hard
but
the
impossible
i
don't
think
is
expected.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
and,
of
course,
it's
a
matter
of
sufficiency
of
the
government's
evidence
on
the
trial
of
this
case,
which
has
not
been
tried,
to
present
a
sufficient
showing
that
possible
precautions
were
omitted
and,
as
one
of
the
justices
point
out,
those
precautions
are
not
limited
to
keeping
the
pests
out
the
building
but
to
controlling
them
once
seen,
to
inspecting
the
food
regularly,
to
rotating
it
so
as
to
eliminate
the
contaminated
food
and
preventing
it
--
preventing
the
contamination
from
spreading
unnecessarily.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
information,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
does
not
merely
charge
that
the
building
was
inaccessible
to
pests.
it
also
charges
that
the
appellee
caused
--
perhaps
i
better
read.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
partly
through
storing
it
in
an
--
in
a
building
unreasonably
accessible
to
rodents
and
other
pests
but
that
is
as
partly
also
because
of
insufficient
measures
taken
to
control
pests
once
inside
the
building
or,
perhaps,
merely
by
a
question
of
where
the
food
was
stored
within
the
building,
not
properly
segregated.
this
warehouse,
for
we
all
know,
was
not
solely
food
warehouse
and
other
goods
would
not
have
been
endangered
by
the
pests
that
did
penetrate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
concede
that
that's
a
possible
reading,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
interpretation
of
the
information
is
not
before
this
court.
the
district
court
construed
the
information
and
it's
on
that
construction
that
it
dismissed
the
indictment.
and,
i
read
district
court
opinion
as
having
construed
the
information
to
say
that
the
food
was
held
under
insanitary
conditions
and,
going
on
to
say,
that
a
mere
passive
holding
of
food
is
not
one
of
the
acts
proscribed
by
the
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
clear
that
the
court,
on
a
direct
appeal
of
this
kind
of
the
criminal
appeals
act,
will
accept
the
district
court's
reading
and
construction
of
the
information
and
will
not
go
behind
it
even
though
it
would
be
wrong.
and,
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
a
reading
of
the
information
which,
for
purposes
of
the
case,
is
accepted,
and
i
do
think
it
clear
that
the
district
court
read
the
information
as
we
do.
now,
in
any
event,
as
i
think
i've
said,
the
law
does
not
require
any
guilty
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
warehouseman.
it
requires
him
to
inform
himself.
if
he
fails
to
inform
himself,
it's
at
his
own
risk.
there
is
a
final
issue
in
the
case
which
is
the
question
of
whether
a
public
warehouseman
is
amenable
to
the
law
at
all.
we
don't
view
this
as
a
very
serious
issue.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statute
is
very
plain.
it
says,
“while
the
food
or
other
article
is
held
for
sale,”
it
does
not
say
“while
held
for
sale
by
the
owner.”
legislative
history
is
equally
clear
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
warehousemen
generally,
without
any
distinction
between
public
and
private
warehousemen.
there
is
in
principle
--
no
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two.
the
purpose
of
the
statute,.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
is
to
protect
food
from
the
moment
it's
introduced
into
interstate
commerce
until
the
time
that
it's
delivered
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it,
mr.
justice
stewart,
“it
held
for
sale”
is
used,
in
our
position,
to
“held
for
consumption.”
and,
the
big
purpose
of
including
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
it's
held
for
--
i
--
they
may
be
a
reading
of
“held
for
sale,”
meaning
in
--
with
a
view
to
a
commercial
transaction
rather
than
to
a
gift,
though,
in
other
sections
of
the
act,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
delivery,
whether
for
pay
or
not,
is
nevertheless
covered.
but,
here,
it
seems
clear
that
the
reason
for
the
provision
“held
for
sale”
is
to
exclude
storage
by
the
housewife
in
her
own
kitchen
cupboard
which
would
not
be
for
sale
but
for
consumption.
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute
here.
i
think
it
clearly
means
“with
a
view
to
its
future
sale,
not
necessarily
by
the
holder
but
by
someone
else.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
was
a
public
warehouse.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
pending
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
pending
sale,
or
so
alleged
at
least.
and
so,
we're
dealing
only
with
the
information
pending
sale
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
were
--
they
were
being
stored,
true,
but
with
a
view
to
their
ultimate
sale
by
their
owner
after
having
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
which,
seems
to
us,
is
all
the
statute
requires.
it
would
make
no
sense
to
hold
the
owner
if
he
stores
it
in
his
own
warehouse,
but
not
to
make
the
law
applicable
to
food
whilst
if
he
chooses
instead
to
store
it
in
a
public
warehouse.
the
purpose
of
the
law,
and
this
court
had
said
so
at
least
twice,
is
to
protect
the
food
every
moment
between
its
introduction
into
interstate
commerce
and
its
delivery
to
the
housewife.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
draw
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
draw
your
honor's
attention
to
the
next
paragraph
in
which
the
court
says
“the
government
contends
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
was
to
prohibit
the
holding
of
food
after
shipment
in
interstate
commerce
under
insanitary
conditions.”
and
then,
skipping
the
quotation,
“this
not
only
makes
one
holding
such
goods
and
ensure
of
it,
it's
subjecting
to
criminal
action.”
apparently,
accepting
the
government's
view
of
the
information,
but
i
wouldn't.
even
if
i
wrongly
interpret
the
court's
opinion
and
we
must
go
back
to
the
information,
it
would
seem
to
me
clear
that
the
information
fairly
read
charges.
first,
that
the
food
was
held
in
a
building
which
was
more
accessible
to
rodents,
pests,
birds
than
it
should
have
been.
and,
secondly,
that
the
warehouseman
did
other
acts,
presumably
failure
to
take
precautions
after
the
pests
once
entered
the
building,
which
exposed
them
to
contamination.
and,
that
second
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
your
honor,
it
does
say
“and
did
cause
that
food
to
be
exposed
to
contamination.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
every
possible
precaution
is
expected,
that
the
law
imposes
a
very
high
standard
of
care
on
warehousemen.
perhaps,
it
does
not
want
to
put
warehousemen
out
of
business,
or
prevent
them
from
storing
food,
or
even
prevent
them
from
storing
food
which
is
packaged
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
attractive
to
rodents.
but,
certainly,
it
requires
that
every
possible
effort
be
made
that
all
holes
in
the
building
through
which
rats
and
other
pests
could
enter
are
closed.
some
of
the
injunctions,
in
the
injunction
cases
in
this
area,
delineate
the
action
which
the
court
seem
to
feel
required
that
fumigation
insecticides
be
used
liberally
inside
the
building,
that
those
commodities
which
are
particularly
susceptible
to
attack
by
rodents
be
separated
off,
that
special
precautions
be
taken
with
respect
to
them,
that
they
be
inspected
regularly
so
as
to
remove
immediately
any
contaminated
foods
stubs
and
prevent
the
rest
of
the
stock
from
being
contaminated.
it
is
a
failure
to
take
all
those
necessary
measures,
which
i
think
fairly
read,
this
information
charges.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
would
--
i
would
think,
perhaps,
that
that
would
certainly
be
relevant.
i
wish
to
point
out
also,
here
in
this
case,
that
the
indictment
charges,
the
information
charges,
acts
done
over
two
periods,
plain
inferences
that
there
are
at
least
two
inspections
and
that
the
conditions
--
insanitary
conditions,
as
they
were
charged,
were
noted,
first,
as
of
august,
the
period
before
which
the
first
four
counts
are
involved,
and
then
again
in
december.
it's
non
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
true.
it
is
the
duty
of
the
food
--
the
statutory
duty
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
carry
out
inspections
of
the
warehouses.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there's
no
regulation
setting
the
standards
for
warehouses
or
--
perhaps
there
should
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
think
that
the
court
should
go
on
to
explain
that
the
warehouseman
was
expected
to
do
only
that
which
could
actually
be
done.
the
fact
that
one
rat
entered
the
warehouse
is
not
the
sort
of
proof
which
we
would
think
sufficient
to
justify
a
verdict
and
the
judge,
presumably,
should
so-advice
the
jury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
difficulty
seems
to
be
that
the
information
charged
too
much.
if
it
had
simply
stated
the
conclusion
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
right.
the
--
but
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
simply
that
the
passive
act
of
holding
is
not
condemned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
even
though
there'll
be
some
failure
to
take
necessary
action
but,
by
using
the
rule
of
analogy,
the
court
thought
some
affirmative
act
was
required.
in
fact,
they
were
clearly
--
it
was
clearly
wrong.
i
should
point
out,
too,
that
possibilities
of
abuse
of
this
statute
have
come
to
this
court's
attention
in
at
least
two
cases.
both
instances,
most
recently
in
the
sullivan
case,
the
court,
through
mr.
justice
black,
said
“it
may
now
be
noted
that
the
administrator
of
the
act
is
given
broad
discretion,
broad
enough
undoubtedly
to
enable
him
to
perform
his
duties
fairly
without
wasting
his
efforts
on
what
may
be
no
more
than
technical
infractions
of
law."
we
assume
in
this
case,
also,
there
is
more
than
a
technical
violation.
