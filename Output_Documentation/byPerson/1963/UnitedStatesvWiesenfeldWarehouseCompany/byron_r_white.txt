justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
evidence
(inaudible)
ways
that
he
can
pull
away
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
for
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
have
district
court
been
saying
(inaudible)
is
the
indictment
of
charge
only
that
the
food
was
held
in
the
warehouse
and
became
contaminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
that
--
and
that
is
what
the
indictment
charges,
except
to
the
office
that
says
it's
held
in
a
warehouse
in
a
manner
that
would
expose
it
to
contaminants.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
was
contaminated.
that
it
was
held
and
became
contaminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
contamination
occurs
during
the
holding.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
need
to
point
out
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
quite
a
major
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
a
major
difference
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
or
make
a
crime
the
holding
of
food
in
a
public
warehouse
and
permitting
it
to
become
insanitary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
food.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
though
--
even
though
you
don't
take
any
action
to
prevent
something
from
happening.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
keep
the
food
safe?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
food
became
contaminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
food
became
contaminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
that
so.
that
isn't
what
--
we
were
not
going
to
decide
that
here.
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
state
that
statute
permits
--
if
we
decided
against,
we'd
say
the
statute
permits
or
that
the
court
was
wrong
below
in
construing
the
statute
the
way
it
did,
but
it
does
cover
holding
food
under
some
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
mean
that
we
don't
necessarily
have
to.
to
decide
for
the
government,
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
say
that
that's
all
the
government's
proof
needs
to
consist
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
information
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
will
be
bad
then.
that
they
did
cause
certain
food
to
be
exposed
to
contamination
by
rodents,
birds,
and
insect.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
(inaudible)
the
government
has
to
prove
insofar
as
your
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
the
government
will
be
--
might
not
get
--
might
not
make
out
its
case,
make
out
a
jury
case,
and
stop
this
showing
that
you
held
the
food
and
that
the
10
bags
of
something
came
out
of
there
contaminated.
they
just
not
--
might
not
make
their
case
out
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
your
motion
--
your
motion
below
was
that
the
acts
charged
in
the
indictment
didn't
constitute
a
crime
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
district
court
said
that
it
didn't
because
it
just
didn't
happen
to
reach
holding
and
it
only
reached
things
connected
with
labeling.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
make
that
argument
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
make
that
argument
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
fundamentally,
you
say
the
statute
really
makes
a
crime
out
of
the
impossible.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
certainty
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
(inaudible)
from
getting
dirty.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
