mr.
james
s.
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor's
office
conceives
almost
every
point
that
we
made
in
our
brief
and
indicates
to
me
most
strongly
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
ruling
and
holding
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
and
basic
disagreement
that
we
have
had
with
the
government
in
this
entire
case
is
over
the
question
of
what
illegal
act
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
this
defendant.
and
the
only
illegal
act
alleged
in
the
information
is
the
holding
of
food
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
pests.
we'll
call
them
pests
instead
of
the
language
that
you
used
on
the
information.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
and
that
the
--
that
is
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
actually,
they
were
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
they
proceed
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
excuse
me?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
i
will
say
i
shorted
my
sentence
there,
your
honor.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
food
was
held
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
pests
and,
as
a
result
of
that
holding,
became
contaminated
or
adulterated.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
they
have
not
alleged
--
or
the
government
has
not
alleged
that
the
building
was
insanitary
and
that's
where
our
basic
disagreement
has
been
throughout
this
whole
proceeding.
it's
the
disagreement
that
the
district
judge
had
with
this
particular
information,
and
the
district
judge
has
said
that
the
information
alleges
that
adulteration
was
caused
by
the
defendant's
act
of
holding
food
in
its
warehouse
which
was
accessible
to
pest.
i
would
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
requires
two
things.
there
are
two
elements
in
the
statute
to
require
conviction.
the
first
element
is
the
doing
of
an
act.
the
sec
--
second
element
is
the
result
--
a
prohibited
result
of
that
particular
act.
you
divide
the
two.
we
concede
that
they've
alleged
adulteration.
there's
no
question
but
what
the
information
alleges
that
the
food
was
in
fact
adulterated.
so,
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
act
which
they
have
alleged
that
we
committed
is
a
crime.
and,
the
only
act
that
they've
alleged
that
we
committed
was
holding
food
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
pests,
just
as
this
building
is
accessible
to
pest.
if
the
door
is
open,
a
pest
can
come
in.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
not
per
se,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
the
permitting
of
food
to
become
contaminated
where
you
can't
do
anything
to
prohibit
it
or
prevent
it,
i
say,
is
not
a
crime
under
the
statute.
now,
what
the
solicitor
has
argued
here
is
certain
exceptions
that
he
conceives
in
his
mind
to
the
statute
certain
defenses
that
he
feels
are
built
into
the
statute.
perhaps
he
feels
so,
but
the
district
judges
throughout
the
country
don't
feel
so
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
it.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
your
honor,
i
will
start
my
answer
to
your
question
by
saying
that
it
is
a
passive
act.it's
an
in-act,
if
we
could
use
that
expression.
but,
that
it
is
the
type
of
thing
that
can't
be
prohibited.
it
can't
be
prevented.
if
we
hold
--
if
we
hold
food
--
if
i
hold
food
here
on
this
podium
and
a
roach
gets
into
it,
it's
something
i
couldn't
prohibit.
the
building
is
not
insanitary.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be,
as
such,
unconstitutional.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
your
honor
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
think
it's
not
sufficiently
defined
if
you
construe
the
statute.
i
don't
construe
the
statute
to
say
that
the
mere
passive
possession
of
food
is
an
act
which
is
prohibited
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
that
goes
to
the
first
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
no
matter
what
happens
to
it,
so
long
as
i
don't
do
anything
to
it,
that
i'm
not
the
producer
of
this.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
in
other
words,
we've
got
an
intervening
third
party
or
intervening
force
coming
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
warehousemen,
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
warehousemen
have
a
very
strong
duty
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
to
keep
the
food
as
clean
condition,
the
warehouse
sanitary
and
the
--
and
to
keep
rodents
out
as
best
as
humanly
possible
to
do
so.
and,
that's
what
we've
done
and
i
think
it's
--
of
course,
we're
here
not
on
the
proof,
and
we're
here
on
whether
or
not
the
information,
as
stated,
is
sufficient
to
state
a
crime.
now,
under
this
information,
all
the
government
has
to
prove
to
convict
these
people
is,
number
one,
that
the
building
was
in
fact
accessible
to
rodents,
which
it
is.
i
mean,
there's
no
question
about
it.
this
building
we're
in
today
is
accessible
to
rodents.
and,
number
two,
that
the
rodents
infested
the
food.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
pardon?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
the
food
became
contaminated.
that's
correct.
and
--
and
with
those
two
elements
to
the
crime,
that's
all
the
government
has
to
prove
not
withstanding
the
argument
that's
been
made
here
today.
i
think
where
the
government
--
where
the
information
is
failing
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
but
that
would
--
you
are
saying
that
would
be
your
feeling.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
that's
all
the
information
has
charged,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
pardon?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
by
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
by
holding
it
in
the
--
that
phrase,
your
honor,
is
modified,
as
i
read
the
information
and
as
the
district
judge
read
the
information,
it's
modified
by
the
first
part
of
that
where
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
excuse
me?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that,
in
reading
the
information
as
the
district
judge
read
that
--
the
information,
because
the
number
of
bags
to
be
held
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
rodents
and
did,
and
this
is
what
my
reading
of
it
and
the
way
that
my
argument
has
been
based
in
it,
and
it
thereby
caused
the
food
to
be
exposed.
now,
if
that
is
not
the
proper
reading,
it's
my
contention
and
i
would
contend
that,
in
order
to
charge
a
criminal
act,
they
can't
simply
say
that
we
caused
the
food
to
be
exposed
without
saying
how
we
caused
it
to
be
exposed
or
what
act
we
committed
to
cause
it
to
be
exposed.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
that's
correct
and
i
think
that's
the
danger
of
the
government
convention
here.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
yes,
sir,
and
i'm
not
contending
here
that
there's
--
i
have
contended
that
they
--
an
intentional
act
is
necessary
or
no
holding
under
known
insanitary
conditions.
that
was
the
government's
concession
in
its
brief.
and
when
the
solicitor
argues
that
i'm
conceding
that
point
or
he's
conceding
that
point,
that
he
was
wrong
in
that
point.
i
never
took
the
position
and
i
don't
now
take
the
position
that
the
statute
requires
a
holding
under
known
insanitary
conditions.
i
think
if
it
was
charged
in
this
information
that
the
man
held
his
food
under
insanitary
conditions,
which
is
quite
a
different
thing,
i'm
saying
that
he
held
it
in
a
building
that
was
accessible
to
pests.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
i
think
that
in
the
construction
of
the
information
such
as
this,
when
we're
preparing
for
trial
under
this
information,
the
information
alleges
that
the
food
was
held
in
the
building
accessible
to
pests.
we
can't
deny
that.
that's
--
that's
true.
if
it
alleges
that
the
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
sincerely
doubt
it,
your
honor,
if
you
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
if
you
can
open
a
door,
an
insect
can
fly
in.
if
you
open
the
warehouse
door,
a
bird
can
fly
through
a
door,
an
insect
can
come
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it
would
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
know
that
it
would
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it
may
possibly
--
that's
my
point
though,
your
honor.
it
may
possibly
contaminate
the
food.
that
the
government
doesn't
take
the
position
it
--
that
this
building
is
insanitary.
now,
i
think
if
there
was
an
allegation
and
a
required
proof
of
an
insanitary
condition,
that's
one
thing.
that's
an
entirely
--
that's
actually
what
the
government
has
taken
the
position
they've
taken
in
their
brief,
but
they
haven't
alleged
it
and
the
district
court
felt
that
they
hadn't
alleged
it
and
he
said
that
he
was
not,
in
his
opinion,
he
says
he
was
not
going
to
hold
these
people
guilty
of
a
crime
for
having
a
building
that
was
simply
accessible
to
pests.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't.
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
information.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
i
think
at
that
point,
your
honor;
we're
getting
into
a
construction
of
the
information
which,
on
direct
appeal,
actually
is
not
within
the
prerogative
of
this
court
to
construe
the
information.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it
--
it
--
and
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
yes
sir
and
it
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it's
a
very
confusing
thing
to
try
to
distinguish
between
when
you're
construing
a
statute
and
when
you're
construing
the
information,
but
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
your
honor
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
oh,
under
the
information
if
you
sustain
the
information.
haven't
you
said
that
that
would
constitute
a
crime?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
page
3
of
the
record,
your
honor?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
caused
it
--
caused
it
to
be
held
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well
at
that
--
at
that
point
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
got
the
words
as
aforesaid
following
that.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
and
then
you
go
back
to
where
it
is
a
foresaid
and
they
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it
is
a
conjunctive
at
that
point.
they
have
joined
--
they
get
two
together
to
make
a
single
offense
or,
in
effect,
they're
saying
thereby
the
food
was
caused
to
be
exposed.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
yes,
that's
--
that's
properly
alleged.
i've
got
no
--
no
complaint
over
that.
it's
the
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
before
we
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
your
honor
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
think
the
--
the
thing
that's
wrong
basically
is
that
it
would
make
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
no.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
not
unreasonably
accessible.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
i
think
to
follow
that,
if
--
if
that
is
a
crime
it
would
follow
that
to
its
logical
conclusion.
if
you
have
a
refrigerated
warehouse
and
you're
holding
food
subject
to
spoilage,
the
refrigeration
plants
breaks
down.
the
food
spoils.
you're
then
guilty
of
a
crime.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
and
the
alternate
breaks
down
and
then
you're
guilty
of
a
crime,
but
this
could
go
on
adding
some
item
and
it
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
it's
such
an
extreme
position
that
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
that
congress
intended
to
go
that
far
to
make
every
one
of
us
guilty
of
a
crime
and
by
inadvertence.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
no
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
--
i
think
this.
i
think
it
takes
more
and
i
think
the
statute
when
properly
construed
takes
more
than
a
mere
passive
holding
of
food
were
you
haven't
done
anything,
where
you
haven't
failed
to
take
a
precaution.
i
think
the
gist
of
this
is
really
in
the
argument
that
wasn't
even
made
by
the
solicitor
and
i
haven't
got
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
the
reasoning
behind
it,
but
if
you
take
the
statute
as
a
whole
in
its
context,
it
requires
the
adulteration,
mutilation,
several
other
active
verbs
or
the
doing
of
any
act,
doing
of
an
act.
not
the
occurrence
of
an
act,
the
doing
of
an
act.
and,
that
implies
some
affirmative
action,
some
conscious
act
in
any
event,
a
conscious
act.
perhaps
the
knowing,
knowingly
putting
food
into
an
unsanitary
place,
that
maybe
broad
enough
but
to
inadvertently
have
an
insect
crawl
into
your
building
and
to
make
you
guilty
of
a
crime,
this
is
not
going
to
affect
or
would
never
affect
the
public
health.
the
--
the
injunction
provisions
of
the
statute
are
very
broad.
the
--
the
seizure
provisions
are
extremely
broad.
these
are
the
places
to
--
where
this
could
be
enforced
where
the
criminal
aspect
of
it
doesn't
come
into
it.
we're
talking
about
$1,000-fine
for
each
offense.
now,
the
second
offense
in
holding
this
food
in
a
building
which
is
accessible
to
pests
would
be
$10,000
and
10
years
in
jail
for
each
count.
that
would
put
this
man
in
jail,
if
it
was
an
individual,
for
60
years
for
simply
holding
this
food
in
a
warehouse
that
may
be
accessible
to
pests.
and,
i
can't
conceive
that
congress
intended
that.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
proper
construction
of
the
act.
i
think
that
some
conscious
activity,
guilty
knowledge
--
willful
violation
i
don't
think
is
required
under
the
act,
but
i
do
believe
a
conscious
act
is
required.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
to
make
it
a
valid
information,
your
honor?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
in
listening
to
the
government's
argument
and
i
believe,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
their
feeling
and
mine
are
pretty
much
the
same
on
this
oral
argument,
but
i
think
that
what
the
information
should
charge
is
an
act
of
omission.
it
should
charge
that
the
defendant
failed
to
keep
his
warehouse
as
clean
as
possible
under
all
standards
or
failed
to
do
this
or
failed
to
do
that
to
make
his
warehouse
clean.
but,
to
simply
say
that
the
building
is
accessible
to
pests,
it
just
--
it's
just
inconceivable
that
the
mere
accessibility
with
no
action
on
the
our
part,
no
failure
of
duty
and,
under
his
reasoning,
even
if
we
have
taken
every
single
precaution,
as
we
have,
and
had
regular
extermination,
as
we
do,
in
spite
of
all
these
precautions,
there's
nothing
we
can
do
to
prevent
the
criminal
penalties
under
the
statute
if
the
instruction
that
this
information
is
proper.
i
think
the
--
the
charge
or
the
act
that
must
be
charged
is
an
act
of
omission,
a
failure
to
meet
the
duty
of
due
care
or
proper
care,
if
we
could
use
the
term,
in
other
words,
basically
saying
what
we
haven't
done
--
telling
us
what
we
haven't
done.
that's
the
gist
of
the
argument.
on
the
--
one
other
point
that
has
been
raised
and
that
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
would
apply
to
a
person
who
was
simply
holding
the
food
as
opposed
--
as
a
possessor
of
food
rather
than
as
an
owner.
this
is
really
going
to
the
common
understanding
of
the
terms
and
interpretation
of
the
statute.
if
you
read
the
statute,
it
says
that
the
food
must
be
held
for
sale
and
this
court
itself
has
recognized
and
granted
in
tax
cases,
but
the
term
“hold”
is
commonly
understood
to
mean
“to
own
or
to
have
some
proprietor
interest
in
it,
some
control
over
it.”
now,
i
concede
with
the
government
that
the
owner
of
this
food
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
for
placing
it
in
an
insanitary
place,
but
the
person
who
simply
holds
it,
who
takes
it
in,
who
doesn't
know
whether
it's
for
sale
or
whether
it's
not
for
sale,
he
doesn't
have
any
control
over
or
knowledge
of
what
use
that's
going
to
be
made
of
the
material
and
why
he
should
be
made
guilty
of
a
criminal
act
simply
by
another
person
changing
his
mind,
changing
an
intention.
and
well,
we'll
certainly
concede
in
a
--
concede
readily
that
the
technicalities
of
property
law
should
not
govern
the
protection
of
the
public
health.
the
seizure
of
these
foods
would
certainly
protect
the
public
health
as
much
as
anything
else.
actually,
in
this
case
here
the
food
was
promptly
seized.
it
wasn't
even
seized.
it
was
promptly
destroyed
voluntarily
that
they
--
this
is
common
practice
in
warehouses.
anytime
the
food
is
found
to
be
contaminated,
it's
seized.
it's
destroyed.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
your
honor,
it
was
rice
in
one
case.
i
think
there
was
some
hamburger
mix.
i'm
not
really
sure
what
hamburger
mix
is,
but
i
think
it's
a
meal
that
goes
into
hamburger.
they
are
packaged
in
small
packages
--
retail-sized
packages
apparently.
that,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
this
is
--
while
the
gov
--
i
don't
say
that
the
government
could
not
have
stated
a
case
against
these
people.
they
may
have
been
able
to
state
a
case,
but
they
have
not
stated
it
in
the
information
the
way
it
was
found.
and,
on
that
reasoning
--
on
the
reasoning
of
the
district
judge
where
he
said
that
the
information
alleges
only
that
the
building
was
accessible
to
pests,
that
that
was
not
an
act
that
was
a
crime.
i
submitted
that
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
only,
your
honor,
if
it
is
construed
in
such
a
way
that
this
particular
inactivity
for
simply
holding
in
a
building
accessible
to
pests,
if
that's
a
crime,
i
don't
see
how
a
man
of
common
intelligence
reading
the
statute
can
know
in
advance
what
course
of
conduct
he
can
follow
to
avoid
criminal
penalties.
and,
i
think
--
and
to
that
--
if
the
court
felt
that
this
information
states
a
crime
under
the
act,
i
think,
under
those
circumstances
that
the
statute
would
be
too
vague
and
indefinite
for
enforcement
as
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
yes,
sir.
that
was
part
of
the
motion.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
no.
the
district
court
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
the
district
court
said
that
it
did
not
reach
the
allegation
that
the
adulter
--
that
the
act
of
holding
food
in
a
warehouse
which
was
accessible
to
pests
was
a
crime.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
say
that
this
statute
applied
only
to
acts
relating
to
labeling.
actually,
it
rejected
my
argument
below
which
i
made
with
as
much
force
as
i
could
that
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis
would
apply
here.
and,
the
court
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
pardon?
mr.
james
s.
taylor
i
make
it,
your
honor,
only
to
the
extent
that
i
did
just
a
moment
ago
that,
in
context
of
all
the
active
verbs
that
are
made
up
into
the
statute,
the
adulteration,
mutilation,
obliteration,
all
of
these
implies
some
affirmative
action.
that's
the
only
application
i
have.
actually,
the
district
court
rejected
that
argument
when
it
said
that
the
rule
is
applicable
only
where
the
intent
is
not
discoverable
from
statutory
language
and
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
use
it
to
--
under
the
alpers
case,
he
wouldn't
use
it
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
that's
basically
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
say
that
we
have
no
ascertainable
standard
by
which
we
can
govern
our
lives
and
know
whether
or
not
we're
guilty
of
a
crime
and
prevent
it,
but
notwithstanding
any
precaution
that
we
take
if
this
information
is
good,
notwithstanding
what
precautions
are
taken
where
--
mr.
james
s.
taylor
well,
that
there
would
be
certainty
in
it,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
there
would
be
clarity
to
the
average
reader.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
clear
to
the
average
reader
of
the
statute
that
that
was
what
it
covered.
mr.
james
s.
taylor
and
maybe
--
we
as
lawyers
can
sit
here
and
analyze
each
word
and
come
up
with
a
result.
but
under
the
circumstances,
i
don't
think
the
average
lay
person
reading
that
statute
could
conceivably
think
there
was
absolute
criminal
liability
imposed.
