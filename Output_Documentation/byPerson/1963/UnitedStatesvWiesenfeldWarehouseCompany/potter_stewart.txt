you
refer
to
what
page
of
your
brief
exactly?
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
it
would
hard
--
be
hard
to
find
a
building
that
was
not
accessible
to
rodents,
birds,
and
insects,
the
building
itself.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
criminal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
you
should
indict
under
what,
six
counts
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
what
penalties?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
this
is
a
corporate
defendant
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
in
most
cases,
if
not
all,
the
defendants
were
corporate
entities.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
what
the
indictment
lead
you
to
believe,
if
you
did.
it
says
that
if
you
have
a
building
which
is,
as
in
fact,
accessible
then
you're
guilty.
that's
the
presupposition
of
the
indictment,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
saying
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
is
this,
isn't
it,
that
it
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
show
the
exercise
of
all
the
reasonable
care
that
could
be
taken
in
keeping
the
food
himself
or
aren't
you
saying
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
don't
--
i
--
you
don't
view
this
as
very
--
this
would
question,
you
say,
of
what's
the
problem.
it
says
it
has
to
be
held
for
sale.
now,
was
this
--
there
was
this
--
was
this
food
for
sale
or
was
it
in
the
warehouses?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
as
for
any
other
purposes
other
than
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
public
warehouse?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it
was
the
foods
--
these
articles
were
being
stored
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
--
by
the
owner
pending
sale
or
whole
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
actually
being
held
for
storage.
it
wasn't
on
sale,
was
it
there?
