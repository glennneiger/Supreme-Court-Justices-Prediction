mr.
herman
d.
rollins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
to
a
plaintiff-petitioner,
loretta
aldrich.
it
comes
from
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia.
a
matter
in
controversy
arises
over
the
refusal
of
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
florida
divorce
decree.
briefly,
these
are
the
facts.
loretta
aldrich
and
colonel
m.
s.
aldrich
were
married
in
1918.
differences
arose
and
they
were
divorced
by
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county,
florida
in
1945.
the
decree
of
divorce
--
both
parties
appear,
i
would
--
i
should
say
and
the
defendant,
colonel
aldrich
contested
the
case.
the
decree
of
the
court
has
found
disposition
of
the
matter
and
among
other
things
directed
that
colonel
aldrich
paid
to
mrs.
aldrich
the
amount
of
$250
for
month
alimony
so
long
as
she
live
and
made
the
same
lien
against
his
estate
in
the
event
he
--
of
this
death.
colonel
aldrich
applied
for
a
rehearing
and
the
alimony
was
reduced
at
$215
per
month
but
remained
just
as
it
was.
there
--
the
other
matters
in
the
decree,
he
remained
just
as
it
had
been
before.
colonel
aldrich
died
in
may
1958.
he
had
kept
his
payments
current
up
until
his
death
but
he
prepared
for
death.
in
this
way,
he
transferred
his
property
to
his
son,
william
t.
aldrich
prior
to
his
death
where
they
had
in
mind
the
tax
collector
or
mrs.
aldrich,
we
don't
know
but
mrs.
aldrich
was
the
one
complaining
here.
she
--
colonel
aldrich's
estate
was
up
for
a
settlement
in
the
circuit
--
in
the
--
in
putnam
county,
west
virginia.
mrs.
aldrich
filed
a
suit
there
to
set
aside
these
alleged
fraudulent
conveyances
that
have
been
made.
when
the
colonel's
estate
was
appraised,
although
a
wealthy
man
or
a
period
had
been
a
wealthy
man,
there
was
only
$7000
appraised
in
his
estate.
it
became
necessary,
of
course,
to
set
aside
these
conveyances
if
the
decree
of
divorce
was
to
be
satisfied
and
the
court
put
away
and
have
been
entered
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
circuit
court
of
putnam
county,
west
virginia
dismissed
our
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
circuit
court,
shall
we
say
it,
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
decree
requiring
alimony
to
be
paid
by
a
man's
estate.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
awarded
the
writ
of
error
and
then
on
argument
by
a
divided
court
affirmed
the
circuit
court
of
putnam
county,
where
we
came
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
briefly,
that
it
--
those
are
the
facts
in
the
case.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia,
in
deciding
the
case
and
refusing
to
give
a
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
decree,
said
that
the
florida
decree
made
a
wrong
decision
in
the
case.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
but
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
proceeds
to
review
the
statutes
and
decisions
of
the
state
of
florida
and
rule
that
the
florida
court
has
made
a
wrong
decision.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
west
virginia
had
found
something
like
this
in
the
decisions
of
the
state
of
florida.
"the
alimony,"
this
is
the
statement
that
often
made
in
the
florida
decree,
"alimony
generally
ends
with
the
death
of
the
husband."
now,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
alimony
ends
with
the
death
of
the
husband.
we
contend
that
the
trial
court,
when
it
goes
into
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
needs
of
the
wife,
the
amount
of
property
that
the
husband
has
and
possibly
the
--
the
fault
or
wrong
of
the
parties
and
a
lot
of
parties
that
--
the
part
that
the
wife
plead
in
acquiring
the
property
still
has
a
right
to
adjudicate
alimony
and
make
the
same
lien
against
the
husband's
estate.
a
court
also
in
west
virginia
cited
a
case
of
(inaudible)
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
ruled
that
alimony
would
not
be
paid
after
the
death
of
the
husband.
but
in
that
case,
there
were
peculiar
circumstances
in
it.
the
court
of
--
in
florida,
and
that
was
an
appellate
court
only
of
--
gave
this
decision,
not
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
held
that
--
that
the
husband
shows
estate
would
be
liable
for
a
certain
amount
of
alimony
for
week
in
the
event
he
died
before
the
wife.
the
court
also
--
the
trial
court
had
awarded
a
permanent
sum,
a
--
a
substantial
sum
and
that
was
done
under
a
statute
of
--
of
florida
which
said
that,
"in
any
award
of
permanent
alimony,
the
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
award
periodic
payments
or
in
a
payment
in
a
lump
sum."
now,
the
supreme
--
the
court
of
florida
in
that
case
had
awarded
a
substantial
lump
sum
to
the
wife
and
intended
also
to
make
alimony
payable
out
of
the
husband's
estate
and
--
after
his
death.
and
the
--
the
court
in
florida
merely
said
this,
said
the
wife
couldn't
get
both
if
she
took
the
lump
sum,
then
any
attempt
to
put
alimony
against
the
husband's
estate
was
void.
that
was
the
--
of
course,
she
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
our
case
here.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
--
i
mean
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
used
that
to
defeat
mrs.
aldrich's
claim
for
alimony
out
of
the
husband's
estate.
now,
this
matter
of
making
alimony
or
claim
against
the
husband's
estate
is
done
in
west
virginia.
the
decisions
of
west
virginia,
we
have
two
decisions
of
west
virginia
and
that
support
that
proposition.
it
couldn't
be
said
that
the
--
the
florida
decree
was
repugnant
to
the
laws
of
west
virginia
and
therefore,
it
wouldn't
be
enforced.
it
was
simply
this.
a
--
a
west
virginia
court
undertook
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
state
of
florida,
the
decision
of
the
florida
court
in
this
particular
case
of
aldrich
versus
aldrich
and
in
so
doing,
held
that
--
dismissed
our
complaint
and
held
that
alimony
would
not
be
payable
out
of
the
husband's
estate.
and
consequently,
the
other
cases
--
the
other
matters
in
our
case
went
out
of
the
window,
of
course,
if
they
had
no
claim
for
alimony,
then
we
had
no
right
to
complain
about
the
wrongful
and
fraudulent
conveyances.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
it
--
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
it
was
a
contest
to
divorce
action.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
yes.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
yes.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
it
was
never
appealed.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
but
the
florida
court
in
johnson
versus
avery
said
that
--
that
the
courts
of
florida
could
decree
a
permanent
alimony
as
--
or
as
in
make
the
same
lien
against
the
husband's
estate
by
decree
or
by
a
contract.
but
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
(inaudible)
to
disregard
that.
now,
we
have
cited
a
good
many
cases
to
this
court.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
still,
i
think
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
prevail
that
it
could
not
be
attacked
in
west
virginia
after
the
time
for
appeal
had
--
had
expired.
in
other
words,
we
contend
that
when
this
florida
court
passed
on
the
matter
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
under
the
subject
matter,
then
the
judgment
of
that
court
became
as
final
as
the
judgement
of
god.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
possibly,
it
could.
possibly,
it
could
but
we
contend
that's
not
a
void
decree
and
--
since
the
court,
down
there,
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
of
the
party.
now,
a
void
--
a
good
example,
we
think
of
a
void
decree
would
be
if
a
state
court
undertook
to
pass
on
a
merit
on
matter
which
is
exclusive
within
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
court.
but
this
was
a
subject
which
is
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
courts.
we
have
--
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
yes,
that
is
quite
right.
but
we
say
if
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
a
remedy
at
all
is
to
go
before
the
florida
court
and
complain
for
a
modification,
they
can't
come
to
west
virginia
and
re-litigate
the
matter.
now,
that
is
the
position
we're
taking,
whether
it
could
have
been
a
void
decree
or
not
but
we
don't
say
it's
also
a
void
decree.
so
long
as
the
west
virginia
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
and
of
the
subject
--
i
mean
the
florida
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
all
the
party
that
it
was
finality.
now,
we
have
quoted
many
decisions
--
put
many
--
have
cited
many
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
other
federal
courts,
law
of
federal
courts
in
this
case.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
i
am
not
certain
that
it
could.
now,
if
it
had
--
if
it
can
be
modified
in
any
place,
could
it
be
in
the
state
of
florida
--
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
yes.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
yes,
but
that
was
on
the
rehear
--
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
made
just
a
few
days
or
few
weeks
at
most
after
the
final
decision,
and
that
court
had
jurisdiction
at
that
time
of
course.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
possibly,
it
could
be
in
florida.
it
can
--
it
can
in
west
virginia,
possibly
by
a
west
virginia
decree.
possibly,
it
could
be
in
florida,
i
don't
know,
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
the
florida
laws
to
say
but
possibly
could.
but
if
phil
aldrich
and
his
--
the
other
defendants
have
any
right
in
that
regard
is
to
go
to
a
florida
court
and
not
come
to
a
west
virginia
court.
mr.
herman
d.
rollins
thank
you.
