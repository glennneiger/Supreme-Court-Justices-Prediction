that
was
the
previous.
justice
tom
c.
clark
existing
law,
he
thinks
--
he
meant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
might
as
well
have
an
injunction
because
without
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
attorney
general
thought
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
declaratory
law.
justice
tom
c.
clark
second,
you
could
join
the
court
if
--
because
you
have
tonight,
someone
see
you
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
you
had
a
declaratory
judgment
but
you're
not
to
be
permitted
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you
can
get
it,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
it's
ridiculous
to
say
that
there's
no
distinction
or
anything.
of
course
there's
a
distinction.
there's
no
distinction
only
in
between
the
declaratory
judgment
injunctions.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
concerned,
it
might
be
(inaudible)
or
you
were
fussing
over
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver
of
payments
different
problem
altogether?
well
there's
one
you
have
to,
if
attorney
general
would
be
restrained
from
doing
that
and
the
others
who
do
not,
as
i
understood
the
one
on
page
3,
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.

well
said.
justice

(inaudible)

present
statutes
of
criminal
statute
in
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
the
same.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
this
bill,
i
think
mr.
rein
said
that
the
--
it
was
found
as
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
this
letter
that
mr.
katzenbach
wrote
subsequent
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
sent
the
bill
out,
approved
at
the
outset?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
was
after
it,
it
came
out
of
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
can't
do
that
to
an
antitrust,
to
bring
a
prosecution
in

investigated.
the
man
to
go
into
a
company's
files
or
at
present
and
the
officers
are
going
to
be
alarmed
that
they
complain
declaratory
judgement
(inaudible)
to
bring
them
out.
i
would
imagine
if
i
was
their
lawyer,
i
told
him
to
bring
in.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
the
congress
wanted
to
extend
the
judgments,
as
they
do
in
some
other
cases
like
perkins
(ph)
to
foreign
agents'
registration
or
whatever
authority
to
do
that,
would
they
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
have
an
argument
so
written?
