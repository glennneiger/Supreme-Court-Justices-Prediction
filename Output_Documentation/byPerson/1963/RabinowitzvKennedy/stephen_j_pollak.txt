mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government's
judgment,
this
suit
raises
the
fundamental
question,
whether
persons
who
have
engaged
in
activities
which
in
the
view
of
the
attorney
general
violates
the
law,
whether
those
persons
may
obtain
the
aid
of
equity
to
bar
a
prosecution.
i
might
respond
right
at
the
outset
or
attempt
to
do
so
to
mr.
justice
black's
last
question
to
my
opponent.
in
our
view,
the
petitioners
have
clearly
stated
their
position
that
this
relief
that
they
see
--
seek
would
bar
their
prosecution
and
that's
--
that's
what
they're
seeking.
they
say
that
a
--
the
relief
if
given
that
the
activities
of
petitioners
are
not
subject
to
the
act
would
end
the
dispute
with
finality.
it
would
be
binding
upon
the
attorney
general.
he
would
no
longer
insist
on
his
demand
that
petitioners
register
and
petitioners
could
continue
their
activities
without
the
threat
of
indictment
in
a
prosecution.
so,
in
our
view
of
the
case,
we
see
no
difference
between
this
suit
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
don't
think
that
the
petitioners
view
the
case
in
that
posture
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
believe
that
they're
seeking
a
binding
judgment
to
preclude
that
description.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no
sir,
no
sir.
no
sir.
in
our
--
in
our
view,
there
are
two
issues
presented.
one,
whether
the
petitioners
have
established
jurisdiction
in
equity,
that
is
by
showing
that
they
would
suffer
a
reparable
harm
from
a
prosecution,
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other,
that
they
would
suffer
irreparable
injury
if
they
chose
to
comply
with
the
statute.
the
second
issue
is
whether
this
suit
is
barred
as
an
unconsented
action
against
the
united
states,
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
or
mr.
judge
skelly
wright
held
that
the
suit
must
be
dismissed
or
whether
the
petitioners
have
avoided
the
bar
of
sovereign
immunity
by
showing
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
or
that
the
attorney
general
would
be
acting
in
excess
of
his
authority,
if
he
determined
to
bring
a
prosecution.
we
believe
petitioners
must
prevail
of
course,
on
both
issues,
if
they
are
to
prevail
here.
petitioners,
in
their
argument
and
in
brief,
state
their
case
on
a
single
proposition.
that
is
that
there
is
no
available
remedy
at
law
by
a
defense
to
a
criminal
action.
they
state
that
the
penalties
provided
by
the
law
are
so
severe
that
they
cannot
seek
to
test,
that
they
are
forced
to
comply.
in
our
view
however,
their
own
conduct
speaks
loudest
in
answer
to
their
contention.
they
chose
to
commence
their
activities.
indeed,
they
chose
to
continue
their
activities
as
representative
of
the
republic
of
cuba
after
the
attorney
general
had
requested
their
registration.
in
--
equity
cannot
relieve
against
these
activities
which
are
passed.
they've
chosen
to
engage
in
them
and
whether
the
determination
of
law
is
made
in
an
equity
action
or
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
for
acts
which
are
already
passed,
petitioners
are
subject
to
the
very
penalties
which
they
urge
this
court
to
--
to
rely
upon
in
taking
or
holding
the
jurisdiction
of
this
suit
should
be
upheld.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
think
that
--
i
think
several
things.
we
--
we
think
that
their
argument
that
the
penalties
are
so
severe
that
no
one
would
ever
run
the
risk,
would
then
have
more
believability
to
it,
if
that's
a
word.
they
have
come
in
here
after
running
the
risk.
we
also
think
it
--
and
i
will
argue
however,
that
even
in
that
case,
we
do
not
think
that
declaratory
judgment
will
lie.
i
think
the
--
i
--
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
might
be
helpful
to
look
briefly
at
the
registration
statute.
it
was
passed
originally
in
1938
as
a
disclosure
measure.
it
--
it
was
directed
as
the
court
i'm
sure
recalls,
at
the
secret
activities
of
representatives
of
nazi
germany,
working
in
secret,
pounding
out
praise
of
the
new
order.
it
was
directed
to
force
these
secret
agents
out
into
the
open
or
to
have
them
face
the
criminal
penalties.
the
court
has
characterized
it
in
the
varied
cases,
a
new
type
of
legislation.
and
as
it
now
reads,
"it
provides
that
no
person
shall
act
as
an
agent
of
a
foreign
principal
unless
he
has
filed
a
registration
statement
or
unless
he
is
exempt."
and
the
law
sets
forth
in
detail,
congress
has
set
it
froth
in
the
statute,
the
information
to
be
filed
in
this
registration
statement.
there
are
other
requirements,
supplementary
registration
statement,
bringing
the
information
up
to
date,
the
filing
of
copies
of
speeches
and
other
materials
which
i
don't
believe
that
my
need
go
into
in
detail.
the
failure
to
comply,
as
the
petitioners
have
said,
is
a
crime
if
willful
and
punishable
upon
conviction
by
up
to
$10,000
fine
and
five
years
imprisonment.
there
is
no
civil
test
provided
for
in
the
statute.
there
are
however,
several
specific
exemptions
from
the
registration
requirements
and
the
other
requirements.
recognized
diplomatic
officials
need
not
register,
bona
fide
representatives
of
religious
and
scientific
organizations.
there's
a
further
provision
that
an
agent
of
a
foreign
government
whose
defense,
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
said,
is
vital
to
our
defense.
an
agent,
when
acting
in
behalf
of
those
defense
interests
need
not
register.
and
finally,
there
is
the
provision
under
which
petitioners
claim
that
they
come,
3
(d)
and
it
reads
that
there
is
exempted
and
i'm
quoting,
"any
person
engaging
or
agree
to
engage
in
private
and
non-political,
financial
or
mercantile
activities
in
furtherance
of
the
bona
fide
trade
or
commerce
of
such
foreign
principal."
i
would
like
to
stop
here
to
state
that
this
provision
which
i've
just
read,
is
an
amended
provision
amended
in
1961,
to
eliminate
the
words
or
other
activities.
in
other
words,
it
previously
read,
"any
person
engaging
or
agreeing
to
engage"
--
let
--
let
me
read
from
the
statute
quoted
on
page
3
of
the
petitioners'
brief
in
this
court
because
that
is
how
the
statute
read
prior
to
1961.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
spend
more
than
a
moment
on
it.
it
is
pertinent
to
the
reliance
petitioners
place
on
the
hearings
of
mr.
arthur
dean.
the
statute
previously
read
as
quoted,
"any
person
engaging
or
agreeing
to
engage
only
in
private,
non-political,
financial,
mercantile
or
other
activities
in
furtherance
of
bona
fide
trade
or
commerce."
now,
that
was
a
much
broader
exemption
provision
and
it
was
as
to
that
provision
that
mr.
arthur
dean
was
testifying
and
he
made
that
very
clear.
he
said
that
the
amendment
had
removed
the
words
or
other
activities
and
it
was
on
those
words
which
the
department
of
justice
had
told
some
lawyers
they
were
not
required
to
register.
i
only
make
the
point
because
the
reliant,
mr.
arthur
dean
was
testifying
that
some
government
people
had
told
him
that
lawyers
were
not
required
to
register
and
petitioners
have
suggested
that
the
law
has
been
administered
in
the
discriminatory
manner
because
they
have
been
asked
to
register.
but
i
believe
if
the
hearings
before
the
fulbright
committee
will
be
reviewed,
it
will
be
seen
that
mr.
dean
was
referring
to
the
law
prior
to
this
amendment,
and
that
mr.
dean
is
pretty
clear
there
that
as
amended,
lawyers
are
required
to
register
and
the
statute
is
not
a
confusing
one.
and
i
might
add
further
that
mr.
fulbright
--
senator
fulbright
on
whom
petitioners
also
relied
because
he
has
stated
that
there
are
some
confusion
or
at
least
a
difficult
legal
problem.
senator
fulbright
was
referring
to
amendments
which
are
being
proposed
so
that
--
in
his
testimony
in
the
hearings,
at
least
insofar
as
there's
suggestion
of
confusing
law
or
inconsistent
administration,
i
don't
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
provision
which
is
being
enforced
here
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
in
the
argument
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
mr.
justice
black,
the
petitioners
cite
lanzetti
and
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine.
and
their
sources
of
the
vagueness
argument
are
mr.
arthur
dean
and
senator
fulbright.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
if
you
were
to
consider
the
void
for
vagueness,
you'd
look
at
that
--
those
arguments
and
so
you
might
consider
it
in
that
sense,
in
that
sense
only.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
in
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
our
position
is
that
a
lawyer
that
represents
a
foreign
government
particularly
in
this
case,
it
happens
to
be
a
socialist
nation
which
has
engaged
itself
in
trade
or
commerce,
is
not
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
engaged
in
non
--
in
private,
non-political
activities
and
that
he's
required
to
register.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
there
maybe
a
distinction
that
is
made
for
a
representation
on
a
one
--
one
time
basis.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
sir.
well,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
we're
not
--
i
think
as
the
petitioners
have
said
that
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
petitioners
are
public
relations
men.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
they
are
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
their
--
their
allegations
are
that
they
represent
the
republic
of
cuba
in
financial
and
mercantile
matters.
they
make
no
allegations
as
to
private
representation
and
we
--
that
therein
lies
the
issue,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
in
representing
a
foreign
government,
a
foreign
government
which
is
itself
engaged
in
trade
or
commerce
that
the
petitioners,
the
lawyers
are
required
to
register.
and
i
say,
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
they
are
required
to
register.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
even
though
everything
they
say
is
true,
i
--
we're
--
we
believe
they're
required
to
register.
yes,
that's
right,
i
think
that's
right.
the
--
they
have
not
said
absolutely
--
well,
they
have
not
said
that
their
representation
is
private.
i
suppose
that's
a
conclusory
term.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
petitioners
--
and
i
--
i
was
discussing
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
law
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
the
law
refers
specifically,
as
came
up
during
the
petitioner's
argument.
the
law
re
--
refers
specifically
to
represent
or
--
an
attorney
acting
as
an
agent.
so
we
think
that
while
--
again,
while
this
is
not
directly
here,
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
pardon
me?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
it's
on
page
56
of
the
government's
brief,
it
says,
"an
agent
of
a
foreign
principal
includes
any
person
who
agrees
to
act
or
acts
within
the
united
states
and
then
it
lists
number
of
things
or
attorney
for
a
foreign
principal."
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
we
don't
know
what
facts
there
are
beyond,
we
said
in
response
to
the
complaint
that
we
didn't
know
whether
their
allegations
that
they'd
engaged
in
other
activities
of
a
--
of
a
--
or
that
they
have
not
engaged
in
other
activities
of
a
lobbying
or
other
nature
were
true,
so
we
don't
know
that.
but
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
they're
required
to
register
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
by
what
they've
alleged.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
we
do
not
think
that
the
merits
are
here.
no,
the
issue
whether
they
are
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
register
is
not
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
think
i've
suggested
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
think
you're
--
i
don't
think
you're
required
to
decide
it.
i
suppose
if
the
court
wishes
to
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
let
--
let
me
turn
then
to
our
position
on
whether
they
have
a
right
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment.
our
view
is
that
the
rules
of
equity
and
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
preclude
this
action
and
that
it
--
to
bar
the
consequences
--
to
bar
a
prosecution
on
--
for
the
activities
in
which
petitioners
have
already
engaged.
we
believe
that
the
famous
cases
of
sawyer,
in
re
sawyer,
ex
parte
young,
douglas
v.
jeannette
and
others,
established
the
accepted
principle
that
equity
will
not
enjoin
a
criminal
prosecution
and
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances.
and
that
those
extraordinary
circumstances
to
bar
a
prosecution
or
two.
that
the
prosecution
must
be
one
which
irreparably
injure
the
complainant
and
two,
that
the
statute
under
which
the
prosecution
would
lie
is
unconstitutional
or
that
the
initiation
of
the
prosecution
is
an
action
in
excess
of
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
we
do
not
believe
that
petitioners
meet
either
of
these
conditions.
petitioners
have
conceded
that
the
irreparable
--
we
--
i
suppose
it's
the
difference
between
us.
we
--
i
felt
that
petitioners
had
conceded
that
they
needed
to
show
irreparable
harm.
they
opened
their
reply
brief
by
saying
that
we
have
belabored
the
point
as
to
whether
petitioners
need
to
show
that
equity
jurisdiction
rely
and
i
understood
that
to
mean
that
they
agreed
that
they
needed
to
show
that
a
prosecution
would
irreparably
harm
them.
we
believe
that
they
do
need
to
show
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
jurisdiction
here
and
we
feel
that
they
have
not
done
so.
they
rely
to
show
irreparable
harm
on
the
single
point
that
they
cannot
get
another
test,
that
is
that
they
--
that
the
penalties
i've
referred
to
preclude
there,
waiting
a
prosecution
in
order
to
test
their
rights,
that
the
registration
act
like
the
rate
regulation
statute
in
ex
parte
young
imposes
such
penalties
that
they
cannot
test
their
rights.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
--
we
do
not
think
that
it
--
that
it
does
come
within
that
because
we
think
there
were
allegations
in
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
suit
to
enjoin
a
criminal
prosecution
could
lie.
we
think
there
had
been
allegations
of
irreparable
harm
which
are
not
present
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
this
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
--
as
we
read
the
cases,
the
--
a
single
prosecution
is
not
a
sufficient
harm
to
give
jurisdiction
in
equity.
that
the
standard
of
ex
parte
young
which
is
the
standard
recognized
in
--
in
the
later
cases
of
the
court
is
that
there
must
be
more
--
a
risk
of
more
than
one
prosecution,
a
risk
of
cumulative
penalties.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
this
--
in
the
--
put
this
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
maximum
penalties
are
$10,000
and
five
years
in
prison.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
--
we
say
that
the
court
statement,
we
rely
on
the
statement
in
prince
--
douglas
versus
jeannette
or
the
spielman
motor
sales
case,
that
a
single
prosecution,
a
single
defense
is
not
irreparable
harm
and
that
these
cases
in
which
the
court
has
upheld
an
injunction,
have
entailed
penalties
which
the
court
has
called
"immense
or
extreme,"
i
may
not
have
the
right
adjective
but
these
are
penalties
which
--
which
have
no
measure.
for
instance,
in
ex
parte
young,
the
sale
of
a
single
ticket
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
as
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
as
i
will
recall
terrace
v.
thompson,
the
provision
and
possibly,
i'll
have
a
chance
to
review
it
before
tomorrow,
but
as
i
recall
it,
the
provision
there
precluded
the
petitioners'
use
of
their
property
during
the
period
that
they
--
they
had
engaged
or
contracted
for
a
sale
and
that
--
and
the
law
precluded
the
sale
and
precluded
their
use
of
the
property
and
i
think
that
the
case
rested
on
that
denial.
a
--
a
factual
situation
which
isn't
present
here
and
i
don't
think
that
measuring
terrace
v.
thompson
and
in
light
of
the
later
cases
that
we
have
a
situation
here
where
equity
will
enter
to
bar
this
prosecution.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
and
i
won't
--
i
won't
have
anything
further
to
say
on
that
case.
i
have
--
our
view
of
the
need
for
equitable
relief
here,
i
have
preferred
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
have
already
engaged
in
their
activities,
they've
--
they've
run
these
risks.
they
will
not
be
subject
to
greater
penalties
by
refusing
to
register.
the
law
specifically
provides
that
this
a
continuing
offense
so
they
are
presently
subject
to
as
great
penalties
as
they
would
be
by
continuing
to
act
without
registration.
also,
they
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
their
--
their
--
the
dispute
maybe
be
settled
with
finality
but
the
government
has
no
assurance
that
this
will
be
settled
with
finality.
if
the
ruling
goes
against
the
petitioners,
they
say
they
will
register
but
they
may
not
make
an
adequate
registration
and
then
they
will
be
back
and
saying
that
the
government
is
asking
them
for
something
that
they're
not
required
by
law
to
give.
and
we
will
have
more
and
more
cases
because
every
time
it
will
be
a
question
that
they
face
criminal
penalties
and
they
have
a
right
to
a
test.
but
assuming
that
they've
not
already
engaged
in
these
activities
for
the
moment,
assuming
that
the
risks
--
the
risks
that
there
are
--
we
don't
believe
come
to
a
--
a
irreparable
harm
such
as
young.
now,
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
citizen
must
run
the
risk
of
a
criminal
prosecution
without
an
advance
statement
by
a
court.
for
example,
the
recent
case
in
which
the
court
denied
certiorari
of
austin
tobin
of
the
new
york
court
authority.
he
was
called
to
produce
documents
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
committee
of
congress,
and
he
took
the
legal
position
that
the
committee
of
congress
was
exceeding
its
authority
in
demanding
the
documents
of
the
new
york
court
authority.
he
refused
as
a
means
of
testing,
his
right
to
--
or
the
committee's
right
to
the
documents,
he
had
to
refuse
to
produce
them.
he
had
to
supply
on
an
occasion
for
prosecution
in
which
he
was
prosecuted.
he
was
sentenced
to
30
days
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
a
$100,
as
a
means
of
testing
whether
he
had
a
right
to
withhold
those
documents.
ultimately,
his
right
was
upheld
but
he
was
not
able
to
come
in
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
he
had
an
obligation
to
produce.
this
question,
he
did
--
mr.
tobin
did
not
try
to
do
that
but
there
was
a
suit
brought
in
a
previews
term
by
linus
pauling,
who
was
asked
to
produce
documents
by
the
senate
internal
security
committee.
he
came
into
court
and
asked
that
the
process
of
the
internal
security,
the
subpoena,
be
declared
void
as
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
he
also
asked
that
if
the
court
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
against
the
internal
security
committee,
that
it
enjoin
the
u.s.
attorney
from
prosecuting
him,
he
also
sued
the
u.s.
attorney.
and
the
district
court
dismissed
that
suit
and
it
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
the
case
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
--
judge
--
chief
judge
prettyman,
judge
bazelon
and
judge
bastian,
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
suit.
there
was
a
very
limited
amount
of
time
and
judge
prettyman
wrote
a
memorandum
in
which
judge
bastian
concurred,
judge
bazelon
concurred
in
the
result
only.
but
judge
prettyman,
while
emphasizing
that
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
in
his
view.
chief
judge
prettyman
also
said
that
declaratory
judgment
would
interfere
with
the
legislative
procedure.
it
would
be
a
judicial
interference
with
the
legislative
proceeding.
it
would
impinge
on
the
duties
of
the
legislature.
now,
in
--
in
our
view,
this
type
of
proceeding
here
in
advance
of
a
decision
to
prosecute
would
be
an
impingement
on
the
functions
assigned
to
the
executive,
the
enforcement
of
laws
which
hold
criminal
penalties.
now,
this
suit
would
change
those
rules.
we
would
have
--
i
cannot
see
a
difference
between
this
case
and
the
case
of
a
trade
association
which
as
an
--
means
--
or
it's
one
of
its
functions,
circulates
resale
prices
and
is
advised
by
the
department
of
justice
that
that's
illegal.
it
will
be
coming
in
to
--
obtained
in
a
declaratory
judgment
that
it
has
a
legal
right
to
circulate
them,
or
doctors.
doctors
are
not
--
are
provided
with
a
right
to
distribute
narcotics.
if
they
do
so
in
the
course
of
their
professional
practice,
why
can't
doctors,
who
have
a
reputation
in
the
community,
they
would
come
in
and
ask
the
help
of
a
court
in
determining
what
the
words
"professional
practice"
means.
the
--
this
case
raises
the
threat
of
criminal
penalties
to
a
--
a
key
to
come
in
in
advance
and
get
the
court
to
advise
as
to
what
--
what
the
law
is.
we
don't
view
that
as
ever
having
been
the
--
the
rules
of
law.
the
--
in
fact
as
the
original
brief
of
the
petitioners
was
filed,
we
thought
that
their
main
point
was
that
prosecution
would
be
a
stigma,
a
stigma
that
they
did
not
rely
on
the
existence
of
penalties.
however,
we
answer
that
saying
that
in
this
court's
opinions
in
spielman
motor
sales
and
douglas
v.
jeanette
and
other
cases,
it
has
always
been
accepted
at
the
one
single
prosecution.
the
stigma
of
a
single
prosecution
was
not
a
grounds
for
equity
to
intervene.
now,
one
reference
to
the
point
made
that
if
they
were
to
comply
with
the
statute,
it
would
be
irreparable
harm.
we
set
out
in
our
brief
the
history
of
26
years
of
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
this
law.
in
that
period
of
time,
there
had
been
16,075
registrations.
the
history
shows
that
there
has
only
been
one
prior
declaratory
judgment
action,
10
years
ago
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
dismissed
by
judge
letts.
no
appeal
was
taken
and
we
assume
that
registration
was
made.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
registrations.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
94
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
figure
is
the
--
the
most
recent
list
of
active
attorneys
or
firms
of
attorneys
that
are
registered
or
haven't
registered.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
lawyers.
every
year
the
attorney
general
makes
a
report
in
accordance
with
the
law
on
the
administration
of
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
and
this
report
list
the
registrants
by
country,
by
name,
by
purpose
and
you
will
find
and
its
running
your
eyes
down
the
list
that
some
have
registered
as
travel
promotion,
public
relations
counsel,
legal
activities,
publicity,
trade
promotion,
legal
services.
there
are
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
sir.
no.
we
don't
--
we
don't
contend
that
there
are
disputes
of
law
over
each
of
these.
but
we
cited
the
figures
initially
as
an
answer
to
the
contention
that
registration
would
be
--
constitute
irreparable
harm
and
that
attorneys
could
not
get
co-counsel.
and
we
felt
that
if,
presently,
there
were
94
active
foreign
agents
among
our
bar,
that
this
was
some
answer
to
the
contention
that
the
registration
would
prevent
or
preclude
getting
co-counsel.
now,
in
our
view,
the
petitioners
then
have
failed
to
show
that
they
are
entitled
to
equitable
relief.
they
have
not
shown
that
having
engaged
in
these
activities,
they're
facing
irreparable
harm
if
the
attorney
general
should
decide
to
prosecute.
but
we
also
believe
that
they
have
not
met
the
second
condition
precedent
to
this
suit,
to
jurisdiction
of
this
suit.
they
--
they
concede
that
it
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states
and
we
--
as
the
cases
in
this
court
have
said,
a
suit
against
the
united
states
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
unless
that
suit
comes
within
one
of
two
exceptions,
that
is
that
the
statute
being
enforced
as
unconstitutional
statute
or
the
action
taken
is
in
excessive
authority.
we
do
not
believe
that
either
condition
is
met
here.
the
main
argument
heretofore,
has
been
by
petitioners
that
the
attorney
general
is
acting
in
excess
of
his
authority
that
he
has
acted
in
asking
for
registration.
but
in
--
as
we
read
the
law,
there
has
been
no
action
in
excess
of
authority.
the
exemption
in
this
law
is
not
a
limitation
on
the
attorney
general's
authority
that
he
as
the
authority
--
as
the
government
official
charged
with
prosecution
of
offenses,
has
full
authority
to
read
the
laws
and
determine
when
and
when
not
to
bring
a
prosecution.
but
this
is
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
there
is
no
specific
authority
in
this
statute
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
for
him
to
ask.
indeed
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
if
indeed,
the
--
at
the
outset
of
the
petitioners'
argument,
the
question
was
asked
whether
if
the
attorney
general
had
not
asked
for
registration
but
had
just
brought
a
prosecution.
what
would
the
situation
be?
i
think
that
if
asking
is
an
excessive
authority
then
the
attorney
general
will
just
cease
asking
and
bring
prosecutions
instead.
i
--
i
haven't
asked
the
attorney
general
what
he's
going
to
do
so
i
--
i
--
he
still
has
his
judgment
to
make
but
--
but
this
asking
for
reg
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i'll
ask
mr.
miller
or
mr.
yeagley.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
mr.
rein,
refers
to
mr.
katzenbach
and
i
do
--
reminds
me
i
want
to
make
one
point
about
his
testimony.
but
the
--
asking
here
for
registration
is
merely
a
--
an
advance
notice
of
the
attorney
general's
judgment
that
a
--
that
activities
in
violation
of
the
law
are
going
on
and
that
he
would
he
intend
to
--
or
possibly
might
intend
to
bring
a
prosecution.
if
the
opinion
of
judge
wright
in
the
court
of
appeals
answers
the
suggestion
that
this
asking
for
registration
is
an
excessive
law.
there
is
just
--
there
is
no
limitation
on
asking
for
registration.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
prosecute
is
also
in
his
absolute
discretion
barring
some
lack
of
good
faith.
now
--
therefore,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
basis
here
for
the
suggestion
that
the
attorney
general
has
exceeded
any
statutory
authority.
in
fact,
we
cite
the
--
cite
several
cases
including
larson
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
attorney
--
that
they
government
official
is
empowered
to
interpret
the
law
and
the
fact
that
he
may
have
made
an
erroneous
interpretation
does
not
mean
that
he's
acting
in
excess
of
his
authority.
quoting
larson,
it
is
argued,
the
court
stated,
it
is
argued
that
an
officer
given
the
power
to
make
decisions
is
only
given
the
power
to
make
correct
decisions.
if
his
decisions
are
not
correct,
then
his
action
based
on
those
decisions
is
beyond
his
authority
and
not
the
action
of
the
sovereign.
there
is
no
warrant
for
such
a
contention
in
cases
in
which
decisions
made
by
an
officer
does
not
relate
to
the
terms
of
his
statutory
authority.
on
our
view,
that
is
--
that
is
this
case
that
the
attorney
general
has
authority
to
prosecute
and
he
has
not,
in
any
sense,
exceeded
that
authority.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
you
understand
our
position
correctly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
trading
agency
--
well,
the
trading
agency
would
be
representing
the
foreign
government,
would
it
not?
it
would
be
the
foreign
government.
it
would
not
the
--
the
foreign
government
would
be
its
principal
and
in
our
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
and
i
think
in
--
in
our
view,
the
trading
agency
would
not
--
if
--
if
we
reach
the
merits,
we
tried
to
stay
away
from
the
merits
because
we
don't
believe
that
they're
are
determinant
of
the
trading
agency
would
not
be
engaged
in
private
activities
in
furtherance
of
trade
or
commerce.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
would
have
to
register.
i
don't
--
i
haven't
run
down
everything
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
therefore
its
lawyers
but
i
--
i
suppose
that
--
that
running
through
this
book,
i
saw
the
(inaudible)
trading
agency.
now,
i
suppose
that's
an
example
of
a
trading
agency
of
--
or
was
as
one
time,
i
don't
know
whether
it
still
exists,
of
the
russian
government.
i
--
and
its
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
possibly,
you
painted
a
case
of
a
customer
rather
than
an
agent
and
if
--
if
you're
buying
in
a
relationship
of
buy-sell
with
a
foreign
country,
i
don't
suppose
then
that
you
are,
although
i'm
not
--
i
can't
stand
here
as
a
student
of
the
--
of
the
limitations
of
registration.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
believe
that
the
--
the
position
that
has
been
taken
is
that
where
you
represent
a
foreign
government
in
the
activities
which
the
--
which
are
financial
or
mercantile,
that
you
are
not
engaged
in
private
activities,
yes.
i
think
that's
the
position
we're
taking.
again,
i
emphasize
that
we
don't
think
the
question
is
here.
let
me
say
in
--
that
these
quotations
from
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach,
were
his
statements
as
to
the
propriety
of
declaratory
judgment
which
is
the
very
issue
that
is
here,
there
is
no
cross
purposes
among
the
federal
government
officials.
mr.
katzenbach
has
written
to
committee
and
said
that
he
was
in
the
error.
he
was
informed
that
there
had
been
some
declaratory
judgment
actions
and
therefore,
he
made
the
statement
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief.
in
fact,
there
have
not
been
such
declaratory
judgment
actions
and
he
has
advised
the
committee.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
he
has
said
--
yes,
he
--
there
have
not
been
successful
declaratory
judgment
actions.
he's
advised
the
committee
that
there
was
one
in
1951
which
was
dismissed
and
that
there
is
this
case
pending
which
at
least
at
the
court
of
appeals'
level
was
dismissed.
if
--
if
his
statement
is
read
--
it
seems
to
me
to
read
as
if
he
had
been
advised
that
these
cases
did
lie
and
he
was
just
saying
to
the
court
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
to
the
committee,
that
--
that
they
had
laid.
i
might
say
that
that
bill,
which
has
been
referred
to
by
the
petitioners,
offers
in
our
judgment
a
civil
remedy
which
would
perhaps
allow
the
department
of
justice
to
determine
such
close
cases
as
this
in
a
civil
forum.
but
it
presents
a
far
different
picture
than
we
have
here
where
we
have
the
petitioners
engaging
in
--
in
their
activities
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
the
government,
having
only
a
--
a
criminal
proceeding
which
out
of
deference,
it
did
not
bring
the
deference
to
the
bringing
of
this
action.
but
certainly,
the
government
cannot
standby
if
a
wave
if
declaratory
judgment
actions
come
in.
it
cannot
standby
and
let
those
actions
run
to
their
conclusion
and
all
of
these
activities
continue.
we're
going
to
have
civil
actions
and
criminal
actions
going
on
at
the
same
time.
it's
been,
i
think
suggested,
from
the
bench
that
there
is
nothing
to
inhibit
the
government
in
bringing
its
criminal
prosecution
when
declaratory
judgment
action
is
brought.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
government
cannot
bring
a
civil
action
now.
the
bill,
which
has
been
reported
out
by
senator
fulbright's
committee,
would
afford
the
government
that
remedy
and
also
a
remedy
to
bring
a
cease
and
desist
action.
that
bill
has
been
adopted
by
the
senate
formulation's
committee.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
i
think
that
the
--
it
seems
like
most
things
have
been
testified
to
before
senator
fulbright
around
here.
but
i
think
the
statement
was
that
we
have
no
power,
no
statutory
power
to
bring
that
action
in
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
katzenbach
believes
that
we
need
it
and
the
man
in
charged
of
the
administration
of
the
law
believe
that
we
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
statute
in
our
judgment,
this
is
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
this
letter
that
mr.
katzenbach
wrote
was
sub
--
was
subsequent
to
his
testimony
and
it
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
it
was
subsequent
to
the
committee
approval
of
the
bill.
the
bill
has
not
cleared
the
--
have
been
brought
to
the
floor
and
i
--
that
is
the
posture
of
the
bill.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
was
after
it
came
out
of
the
fulbright
committee,
yes.
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
in
--
in
our
judgment
the
bringing
--
the
determination
of
questions
of
--
of
when
to
bring
on
a
case,
when
to
prosecute?
particularly,
this
is
a
case
involving
foreign
relations,
relations
with
the
foreign
--
foreign
principal.
those
are
questions
which
are
given
to
the
government,
to
the
attorney
general
and
they
are
not
questions
which
are
to
be
decided
by
the
private
individual.
it's
not
the
citizen's
decision
when
to
make
the
government
come
in
to
court
and
litigate
these
questions.
i
think,
the
example,
perhaps
easiest
to
come
to
mind
is
the
antitrust
situation.
you've
got
limited
staff.
you
can
only
bring
your
cases
in
the
areas
that
require
the
most
attention.
and
if
the
government
has
to
come
in
and
litigate
the
questions
because
the
individuals
think
that
there
is
a
risk
why
we
have
lost
control
of
the
management
of
our
prosecution
of
the
laws.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
can't
--
i
don't
think
we
can
only
look
at
this
particular
case.
i
--
i
think,
i've
tried
to
argue
as
if
this
was
the
only
--
the
only
case
here.
but
this
case
presents
a
question
really
which
comes
up
all
the
time,
that
is,
people
fearing
a
criminal
prosecution,
want
the
court
to
them
an
opinion
as
to
whether
their
--
the
private
individuals'
interpretation
of
the
law
is
correct
or
whether
the
government's
interpretation
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
what
--
well,
i
don't
want
to
extend,
i
don't
want
to
extend
the
risks
overbroad
here.
what
i
said
in
my
argument
was
that
a
trade
association
circulating
retail
prices
and
advised
by
the
attorney
--
by
the
antitrust
division
that
that
was
illegal,
would
come
in
to
bring
action.
i
suppose
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
suppose
if
the
government
--
if
this
case
were
to
go
against
the
government,
the
--
that
the
government
would
be
best
advised
to
keep
its
mouth
shut
and
then
bring
its
prosecution.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
--
the
--
the
complaint
characterized
this
as
a
demand
for
registration.
in
the
argument
here,
petitioners
have
quite
correctly
said
that
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
and
then
meetings.
i
don't
think
that
the
lines
are
very
far
different
from
the
threat
which
is
posed
if
there
is
an
investigation
of
antitrust
--
of
anti--
activities
possibly
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
our
--
our
judgment
is
that
that's
precisely
where
the
decisions
should
be
made
here
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
this
is
a
decision
which
congress
made
when
it
made
the
law
subject
to
--
to
criminal
penalties.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
don't
--
we
think
that
would
be
the
same
case.
we
think
it
could
not
be
brought
on
the
civil
side
and
we
don't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
why
not?
well,
we
don't
think
that
would
be
the
kind
--
we
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
kind
of
relief
that
the
petitioners
are
seeking.
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
issue
at
law
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
--
if
the
attorney
general
brought
a
prosecution
and
then
once
it
was
brought,
the
petitioners
said,
"we
want
to
go
into
a
civil
court
to
enjoin
the
prosecution."
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
and
so
that
perhaps
they
could
continue
their
activities.
if
they
were
going
to
attempt
to
get
that
sort
of
relief,
we
think
it
would
be
denied
on
the
strength
of
the
--
intent
of
the
law.
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
if
the
government
has
indicted
in
a
--
for
past
activities
that
he
would
just
not
afford
any
kind
of
relief
to
go
into
a
civil
court
to
get
an
injunction.
you
just
--
you'd
have
as
they
said,
you've
have
the
same
court
making
the
same
decision
of
law.
there
would
be
no
--
there
would
be
no
irreparable
harm.
there
would
be
no
question
that
equity
would
deny
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
i'd
already
argued
that
and
he
was
saying
i
don't
accept
that
but
i
hope
he
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
that
basic
policy
exists
and
we
think
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
putting
the
government
through
two
trials.
i'm
not
sure
but
what
in
your
example
we
wouldn't
have
to
proceed
from
the
civil
court.
if
the
government
prevailed
in
the
civil
court
then
we
would
go
back
into
the
criminal
court
and
we'd
have
different
burdens
of
proof
and
different
questions
(voice
overlap).
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
certainly
are
dif
--
if
what
you
mean
is
an
order
to
get
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
there
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
unless
the
allegation
was
being
made
that
the
attorney
general
in
--
in
requesting
registration
in
your
case
was
acting
in
bad
faith
or
something,
that
we'd
have
--
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
your
question
poses
more
questions
of
fact.
your
man
is
saying,
"well,
i
don't
even
--
i
don't
even
know
him."
and
i
can
understand
--
i
personally
can
understand
how
you
--
your
case
would
arise,
how
the
attorney
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
there's
--
because
in
this
case
we
have
today,
there's
a
finer
more
concise
legal
question
and
that
we
don't
have
as
many
open
facts
possibly.
but
i
think
that
the
same
--
that
the
question
is
presented.
we'd
have
to
say
that
civil
action
was
no
more
warranted
there
than
here.
this
isn't
the
way
the
law
proceeds.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
think
that
i
would
--
at
the
moment
can
only
repeat
that
the
reference
in
that
quote
i
think
to
terrace
v.
thompson,
also
refers
to
the
laws
of
the
use
of
property
which
has
been
customarily
one
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
wouldn't
want
--
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
i
thought
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
the
--
in
the
subsequent
history
of
the
use
of
the
declaratory
judgment
acts,
we
find
no
case
where
the
possibility
of
a
single
prosecution
with
the
customary
penalties,
that
is
penalties
of
fine
and
imprisonment
which
have
a
--
which
are
limited
in
nature,
in
other
words,
five
years,
$10,000
or
some
other
penalties.
we
find
no
case
in
which
the
presence
of
those
potential
penalties
is
enough
to
afford
declaratory
relief.
and
i
think
that
that
is
why
we
felt
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
not
provide
and
was
not
intended
to
provide
a
remedy
in
the
civil
courts
where
there
was
a
question
of
law
which
would
be
determined
in
defense
to
the
criminal
action.
now,
we
may
not
have
read
the
--
we
may
not
have
read
the
legislative
history
correctly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
i
--
well,
i
only
--
i
believe
there
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
have
--
my
standing
here
--
my
recollection
is
that
subsequent
to
that
time,
there
are
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
said
that
just
a
criminal
defense
is
not
enough.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
necessity
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
well,
i
--
i
see
that
distinction.
i
see
that
distinction.
i
don't
see
it
in
the
cases.
i
think
that
the
--
i
--
i
have
my
reading
of
the
cases
is
that
they
require
you
to
defend
once.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
other
question,
which
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
case
of
thompson
versus
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
oh!
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
--
the
reason
i
think
is
as
we
read
this
court's
opinions
in
the
sovereign
immunity
cases
that
the
merits
don't
determine
the
disposition
of
the
question.
thank
you.
