mr.
david
rein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
here
are
members
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york,
engaged
in
the
general
practice
of
law
under
the
firm
name
of
rabinowitz
and
boudin.
since
this
case
is
here,
on
a
motion
for
judgment
of
the
pleadings,
the
facts
are
--
is
set
forth
on
the
complaint,
and
i
will
just
briefly
state
what
the
complaint
said
with
regard
to
the
matter
in
controversy.
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
compliant,
petitioners
were
retained
on
or
about
september
10th
of
1960,
by
the
republic
of
cuba
to
represent
that
government
in
purely
mercantile
and
financial
matters.
the
retainer
does
not
cover
advice
and
representation
involving
public
relations,
propaganda,
lobbying,
or
political
or
any
other
non-legal
matters.
and
the
petitioners
have
not
in
fact
represented
the
republic
of
cuba
in
any
respect
other
than
in
mercantile
and
financial
matters.
in
august
of
1961,
of
the
respondent,
the
attorney
general
here
demanded
that
petitioners
register
with
him
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
of
1938.
petitioners
came
down
to
washington
and
discussed
the
matter
with
the
representatives
and
subordinates
of
the
attorney
general
and
they
maintained
that
their
representation
of
the
republic
of
cuba
did
not
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
act.
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact;
they
were
expressly
exempted
from
the
act
by
the
provisions
of
simply
section
3
(d)
which
exempt
individuals
who
engage
in
purely
mercantile
and
financial
matters.
the
respondent
nevertheless
insisted
and
proudly
continues
to
insist
the
petitioners
register.
mr.
david
rein
there
is
no
dispute
at
all
on
this
compliant
and
this
set
of
facts.
let
me
say,
the
government
in
their
answer
said
as
follows
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
retainer.
they
admitted
the
allegations
of
the
compliant
and
then
they
went
on
to
say,
"they
did
not
have
any
sufficient
information
and
belief
to
determine
whether
there
was
anything
more."
but
they
have
never
alleged
that
there
was
anything
more.
they
simply
say
that,
"maybe
there
is,
we
don't
know."
but
in
the
discussions
that
we
had
with
the
attorney
general,
he
did
not
say
that
they
had
to
register
because
they
represented
the
republic
of
cuba
or
in
any
way
other
than
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
david
rein
that's
right.
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
rein
there
is
no
other
issue
raised
here
by
the
pleadings
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
issue
raised
by
the
attorney
general
even
outside
the
pleadings
except
apparently
to
say
that
he
doesn't
know
anything
more,
though
he
has
full
knowledge
really
of
the
--
i
can
state,
he
obviously
does
have
full
knowledge
of
the
appearances
which
the
petitioners
have
made
upon
by
--
for
the
other
republic
of
cuba.
mr.
david
rein
i
understand
it's
a
continuing
arrangement.
mr.
david
rein
the
pleadings
don't
state
the
nature
of
the
financial
payments.
mr.
david
rein
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
rein
it
is
a
general
--
mr.
david
rein
it
is
a
general
--
mr.
david
rein
it's
a
general
retainer
for
--
for
the
--
the
legal
matters.
in
other
words
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
i
think
they
would
bring
all
legal
matters
to
the
client
as
they
come
up,
but
the
nature
of
the
retainer
and
the
nature
of
the
relationship
has
been
that
there
are
continuous
matters
and
they
have
been
continually
engaged
in
litigation
on
behalf
of
their
clients.
now,
i
don't
--
was
that
answers
the
question?
mr.
david
rein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
rein
well,
they
represent
the
republic
of
cuba
as
their
lawyer
in
matters
involving
money.
i
--
i
think
it's
what
it
comes
down
to
and
that's
--
that's
how
they
have
represented.
i
think
the
character
of
the
representation
is
best
illustrated
--
mr.
david
rein
--
by
the
case
in
which
they
appeared.
mr.
david
rein
or
filing?
mr.
david
rein
filings?
i'm
sorry
i
don't
get
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
represent
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
--
i
represent
rabinowitz
and
boudin
here
and
they're
not
here
as
--
hearing
on
behalf
of
the
republic
of
cuba.
i'd
also
consider
the
republic
of
cuba
is
a
party
to
this
case.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
let
me
say
this,
so
i'm
giving
the
facts,
i
think
both
sides
agree
here
that
the
issue
was
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
here
do
have
to
register
under
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
it's
really
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
and
i'm
just
stating
on
the
pleadings.
and
so
i
don't
think
it
would
help
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
to
go
on
to
it
any
further
than
we
have,
if
i
may
say
so.
but
just
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
--
that's
the
question.
i
just
want
to
add
one
point
on
that.
the
character
of
their
relationship
i
think
is
best
exemplified
by
their
appearance
here
for
the
republic
of
cuba
or
in
a
case,
which
was
argued
before
this
court
this
term.
i
think
that's
about
typical
of
the
kind
of
representation
they
have
given
in
matters
of
that
nature.
and
it's
a
case
which
was
argued
here
and
is
pending.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
the
sabbatino
case.
and
that
i
say
demonstrates
the
nature
of
the
type
of
representation.
at
--
the
petitioners,
after
their
discussion
with
the
attorney
general,
in
which
they
came
to
an
impasse,
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court,
asking
for
declaratory
relief,
declaring
that
their
activities
are
--
do
not
subject
them
to
the
requirements
of
registration.
they
attach
to
the
complaint
and
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
here
the
nature
of
the
interest.
as
exhibits,
the
registration
forms
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
attorney
general
and
which
petitioners
would
be
required
to
complete
if
they
were
required
to
register
under
the
act.
and
this
form
would
require
petitioners
to
disclose
all
of
their
businesses,
occupations
and
public
activities
without
regard
to
any
relationship
of
these
activities
to
their
representation
of
the
republic
of
cuba.
they
would
be
required
to
list
all
of
their
other
law
clients
or
any
other
outside
activities
which
they
may
have
outside
their
law
business,
and
all
talks,
pictures,
radio
broadcasts
which
they
may
have
made
or
articles
or
books
which
they
may
have
written.
the
form
would
also
require
them
to
list
all
of
their
stockholdings
on
any
pecuniary
interest
they
may
have
in
any
other
corporations
or
any
other
business
enterprise.
again,
without
regard
to
any
relationship,
these
other
business
enterprises
might
have
with
their
representation
of
their
foreign
principal,
the
republic
of
cuba.
in
addition,
the
complaint
alleges
that
because
of
the
nature
of
their
retainer,
our
counsel
find
it
necessary
to
bring
litigation
in
courts
throughout
the
country
and
that
in
this
connection,
they
find
it
necessary
to
retain
associate
counsel.
and
attached
to
the
complaint
is
another
form
of
the
attorney
general
which
the
attorney
general
would
require
all
associate
counsel
to
complete,
and
this
form
would
require
anybody
who
is
associated
even
in
a
individual
case
for
the
petitioners.
they
would
have
to
disclose
all
visits
to
or
residences
in
foreign
countries
within
the
past
five
years
or
club,
societies,
committees
or
other
non-business
organizations
of
the
united
states
or
elsewhere,
of
which
they
had
been
members,
directors
or
--
and
so
forth.
then
also
all
books,
magazines,
articles,
pictures
which
the
associate
counsel
may
have
made.
and
the
complaint
alleges,
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
burden
put
upon
associate
counsel
would
make
it
extremely
difficult
for
petitioners
here
to
retain
associate
counsel
in
many
cases.
associate
counsel
maybe
willing
to
commit
to
a
case
but
not
at
the
price
of
such
a
disclosure,
an
invasion
to
their
privacy,
and
they
alleged
that
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
as
requiring?
i
will
get
to
that
later.
i
would
like
to
argue
that
it's
unconstitutional
at
a
certain
respect,
in
respect
to
vagueness.
i
do
not
argue
that
if
congress
had
required
lawyers
engaged
in
the
financial
and
mercantile
matters
to
register
for
foreign
principals,
that
congress
does
not
have
their
power.
i
do
not
maintain
that.
i
would
say
a
question
would
be
raised,
which
i
think
isn't
raised
here,
as
to
whether
if
congress
had
required
people
in
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
to
register
whether
the
attorney
general
could
ask
him
the
cause
of
that
registration,
the
kind
of
questions
and
information
that
he
does
ask
which
seemingly
are
all
slanted
toward
what
the
statute
does
really
require
that
is
people
who
engaged
in
propaganda
activities
--
mr.
david
rein
--
and
that
--
mr.
david
rein
as
one
of
the
question
beyond
that,
no.
i
haven't
presented
that
at
all
in
the
brief,
as
to
whether
the
questions
go
beyond
a
reasonable
regulation.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
well,
he's
gone
beyond
the
provisions
of
the
act
in
asking
these
petitioners
to
register?
mr.
david
rein
they
are
expressly
exempt.
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think,
when
we
go
beyond
that.
we
say
he
has
no
right
to
require
them
to
register
at
all.
mr.
david
rein
and
we
point
this
out
as
showing
the
injury,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
the
petitioners
to
be
required
to
register
when
there
is
no
requirement
at
all
to
say
that
the
registration
would
be
a
gross
invasion
of
their
privacy
--
mr.
david
rein
--
because
of
what
is
asked
to
them.
and
we
do
point
out
arguing
and
it
would
come
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
act,
that
the
kind
of
things
that
the
attorney
general
ask
people
to
answer
do
make
sense
when
applied
to
foreign
propaganda
agents
which
is
what
the
act
was
intended
to
cover.
they
make
absolutely
no
sense
when
applied
to
petitioners
but
we
say
--
mr.
david
rein
we
say
it
is
--
mr.
david
rein
we
say
it's
wholly
irrelevant
except
in
connection
with
showing
why
we
have
a
right
to
bring
declaratory
judgment
action
and
why
we're
entitled
to
declaratory
relief.
mr.
david
rein
well,
apparently
we
have
to
show
that
registering
would
injure
us
in
some
way.
we
have
a
legal
interest
to
protect,
yes.
i
think
we
do
and
that's
the
substance
of
it.
now,
if
the
court
says
we
can
bring
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
relief
without
showing
that
there's
a
gross
invasion
of
our
privacy,
i'm
certainly
willing
to
go
along
with
that.
i
think
if
i
--
i
put
this
in
to
show
the
burden
that
we
do
have
to
make,
that
we
do
have
a
legal
interest
to
protect
here
and
that
is
the
legal
interest
of
the
right
of
privacy.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
i
would
say
that's
just
on
general
--
general
equitable
principles
that
in
order
to
come
in
and
ask
the
court
for
relief,
you
have
to
show
that
you've
been
injured
in
some
way.
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i'd
go
beyond
that.
but
i
think
we've
met
it
so
i
don't
think
that's
the
problem
and
that's
the
only
reason
why
i
was
going
into
these
matters.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
and
we
have
to
show
that
there
is
an
interest
to
be
protected
and
that
i
say
is
our
interest.
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
the
government
filed
an
answer
in
which
as
i've
indicated,
they
substantially
admitted
all
of
the
allegations
in
the
pleadings.
they
wanted
two
aspects
in
which
they
commented.
they
did
not
have
sufficient
information
or
belief
to
state
an
answer.
but
the
case
came
before
the
district
court
on
the
basis
really
of
the
allegations
and
the
compliant.
the
government
--
government
moved
there
for
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
and
the
district
court
denied
it.
the
government
then
applied
to
the
district
court's
belief
to
bring
an
interlocutory
appeal
stating
and
asking
the
court
to
certify
that
there
was
a
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
could
bring
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
under
a
new
statute
1292
(b),
the
district
court
certified
that
an
interlocutory
appeal
could
be
taken
on
that
question
alone.
that
question
was
a
--
here
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
heard
it
on
that
question
and
reversed
the
district
court
holding
that
the
action
could
not
be
brought
in
a
divided
opinion
with
the
dissent
by
judge
fahy.
we
say
therefore,
the
case
is
before
the
court
in
the
present
posture.
the
trial
court
held
that
on
the
facts,
and
i
think
we
must
assume
that
on
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
petitioners
are
exempt
from
the
requirement
of
registration
under
the
act
and
they're
not
required
to
register.
and
the
government
appealed
on
the
ground
and
this
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
that
assuming
that
they
are
exempt
and
are
not
required
to
register,
are
they
entitled
to
have
a
court
declare
that
in
this
declaratory
judgment
proceeding?
and
they
raised
two
questions,
and
there
are
two
question
related
with
respect
to
that
single
basic
issue.
one,
is
this
an
appropriate
case
for
declaratory
judgment
relief
and
two,
whether
the
action
is
an
unconsented
suit
against
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
the
same
considerations
really
should
determine
the
answer
to
both
questions
but
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
orderly
presentation,
i
wish
to
discuss
first
the
question
of
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
declaratory
judgment
relief.
we
have
set
out
at
page
24
of
our
main
brief,
the
leading
case
in
this
court
on
declaratory
judgment
relief,
setting
out
the
factors
that
must
be
satisfied
before
a
case
was
appropriate
for
declaratory
judgment.
and
we
say
and
i
think
i
want
to
discuss
it
only
briefly
because
i
don't
know
if
the
government
disputes
it
seriously,
that
we
made
all
of
those
requisites.
one,
the
controversy
here
is
definite
and
concrete.
it
is
not
hypothetical
and
abstract.
we
contend
that
under
the
statute,
the
legal
representation
of
a
foreign
government
in
purely
financial,
mercantile
matters
is
exempt.
the
government
contends
on
the
contrary
that
the
statutory
exemption
does
not
apply,
as
i
understand
their
argument,
where
the
foreign
principal
is
a
foreign
government
or
at
least
as
it
seems
to
have
modified
its
position
in
its
brief
here,
at
least
where
that
foreign
government
controls
the
means
of
production
in
commerce
within
its
borders.
that
is
the
concrete
legal
issue
posed
by
the
pleadings
and
by
the
controversy.
the
controversy
again,
dealing
with
the
language
of
the
acme
case,
it
touches
the
legal
relations
of
parties
having
adverse
and
legal
interests.
the
petitioners
here
have
a
legal
right
not
to
make
disclosures
of
their
private
affairs
in
the
absence
of
a
lawful
governmental
requirement
that
they
do
so.
in
addition,
as
we
have
shown,
the
requirement
of
registration
will
interfere
with
their
ability
to
--
to
practice
law.
on
the
other
side,
if
petitioners
are
required
to
register,
the
attorney
general,
as
the
government
official
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
act,
he
has
a
legal
interest
and
a
legal
duty
to
require
their
registration.
the
controversy
is
real
and
substantial.
the
respondent
here,
the
attorney
general
has
formally
demanded
that
petitioners
register.
the
petitioners
of
--
replied
that
they
are
not
covered
by
the
act.
they
have
discussed
the
matter
with
them.
the
matter
has
reached
an
impasse.
we
have
a
real
and
actual
dispute
and
the
opposing
legal
views
of
the
parties
would
be
presented
in
this
litigation
as
clearly
and
as
sharply
as
they
would
be
in
any
other
litigation
and
any
other
forum.
in
addition,
the
cases
present
no
problem
as
it's
sometimes
presented
in
declaratory
judgment
actions
of
--
arising
from
a
conflict
between
federal
state
relations.
this
is
entirely
a
federal
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
same
identical
court
would
pass
on
this
legal
issue
in
this
proceeding
as
it
would
pass
upon
it
if
it
were
brought
up
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
david
rein
fortunately,
we
have
not
been
faced
with
that
problem.
we
were
able
to
come
in
to
court
and
ask
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
be
declared,
that
our
rights
be
declared
prior
to
the
instituting
of
any
such
action.
and
i
believe
that
--
i
would
stretch
it
out
here,
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
right
to
injunctive
relief
on
the
basis
of
the
way
the
posture
of
the
case
lies.
but
we
don't
need
to
come
to
that.
the
attorney
general,
whatever
reason
he
has,
has
not
brought
a
prosecution
here
and
our
declaratory
judgment
action
was
brought
first.
and
i
think
that
since
we
have
the
right
to
relief
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
it's
unnecessary
to
decide
what
the
situation
would
be
if
he
had
moved
first
since
he
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
we
have
enough
of
a
threat,
let's
say
without
a
formal
saying,
i
will
prosecute
you
if
you
don't
register.
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
not
the
act
itself.
the
act
itself
is
not
enough
because
under
the
act,
the
act
has
no
threat
at
all
because
the
act
were
examined,
if
we
read
the
act.
we
don't
think
the
act
is
a
threat,
but
we
think
its
formal
demand
that
we
register,
writing
a
letter
and
saying,
"you
are
under
the
act
and
you
should
register."
the
fact
that
we
had
a
conference
with
him
and
we
said,
"we
are
not
under
the
act,
we
do
not
have
to
register."
and
he
said,
"i
remain
unconvinced
by
your
arguments.
i
say
you
do
have
to
register.
that
is
my
interpretation
of
the
law."
i
say,
beyond
that,
i
think
that's
sufficient
to
make
the
--
make
the
controversy
sharp
and
clear.
if
then,
the
only
step
remaining
was
for
him
to
bring
a
prosecution.
i
think
it
was
fair
for
the
petitioners
to
assume
that
if
the
attorney
general
believed
that
they
were
under
the
act
and
that
they
didn't
register
that
he
would
prosecute
because
there's
no
purpose
in
his
formal
demand
other
than
that.
now,
we
can't
say
that
he
was
conceivable
that
he
might
have
changed
his
mind
or
he
might
have
been
bluffing,
i
don't
know.
but
i
think
the
issue
has
been
sharply
enough
proposed
to
this
point
to
permit
a
declaratory
judgment
relief.
finally,
we
say,
the
controversy
admits
a
specific
relief
through
a
decree
of
a
conclusive
character.
in
other
words,
the
judgment
of
this
court
saying
that
the
petitioners
on
the
basis
of
their
conceded
activities
either
were
or
were
not
under
the
coverage
of
the
act
would
end
this
dispute
in
a
final
manner.
the
government
argues
nonetheless
that
the
court
should
not
entertain
this
action
and
it
has
really
two
basic
positions.
i
think
first
--
well,
let's
say
there
are
three
grounds
in
which
it
advances.
first,
it
says
that
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
such
that
congress
intended
to
make
a
criminal
prosecution
the
exclusive
means
of
testing
the
applicability
and
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
the
government
points
to
no
statutory
language
to
that
effect.
the
statute
doesn't
say
--
the
statute
simply
provides
that
on
a
failure
to
register,
it's
a
crime
and
the
attorney
general
may
prosecute.
it
doesn't
say
that
this
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
way
in
which
the
validity
of
the
act
can
be
tested.
it
doesn't
say
you
can't
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
but
the
government
argues
that
congress
had
that
purpose
and
it
argues
it
from
the
general
congressional
purpose
underlying
the
statute.
and
it
sets
out
at
considerable
length
in
its
brief,
pages
15
to
24.
the
general
purpose
of
this
foreign
agents
registration
act
and
they
point
out
quite
correctly
and
we
--
we
agree
with
them
that
congress
passed
this
act
because
they
wished
to
force
those
engaged
in
the
dissemination
of
propaganda
on
behalf
of
the
foreign
principal
to
register
so
that
people
who
read
this
foreign
propaganda
and
read
this
propaganda
would
know
the
source.
and
that
these
individuals
would
not
be
able
to
operate
in
secrecy.
that
is
to
put
out
foreign
propaganda
without
disclosing
that
you're
a
--
in
fact,
a
foreign
agent.
what
is
applied
to
this
case,
this
argument
about
a
denial
of
declaratory
judgment
relief
because
of
that
general
theory
and
philosophy
underlying
the
act
is
just
plain
nonsense.
in
the
first
place,
petitioners
here
are
not
engaged
in
any
propaganda
or
any
public
relations
or
lobbying
activities.
in
the
second
place,
there's
nothing
about
their
representation
to
their
foreign
principal
which
is
secret.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
stated
not
only
by
bringing
this
action
but
they
have
appeared
in
court
in
numerous
occasions
as
they
have
appeared
in
this
court
and
have
stated
that
they
represent
the
republic
of
cuba.
so,
there's
no
question
here
about
somebody
seeing
propaganda
or
issue
by
the
petitioners,
which
they
don't
issue
and
not
knowing
that
they
--
comes
from
them
when
they
have
not
--
there
are
no
secrets
about
their
representation
of
the
republic
of
cuba.
we
say
it
demonstrates
quite
clearly
and
it's
a
--
so
the
demonstration
that
has
come
out
even
sharp
--
more
sharply
in
a
recent
hearings
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
which
i
will
come
to
later,
about
considering
amendments
to
the
act.
that
the
problem
which
gives
rise
to
this
present
case
and
which
has
created
the
problem
is
the
effort
of
the
department
of
justice
to
apply
the
act
which
was
designed
as
you
read
the
legislative
history,
the
quotations
and
everything
that
the
government
sets
fort
in
its
brief,
it
was
of
design
to
cover
foreign
propaganda
agents
who
were
secret
about
their
connection
with
their
foreign
principal.
and
the
government
has
now
taken
this
statute
and
tried
to
apply
it
in
a
completely
different
situation,
has
tried
to
apply
it
to
lawyers
who
were
not
engaged
in
propaganda
and
who
do
not
conceal
their
activities.
and
we
also
show
that,
if
anything
their
legislative
history
would
prove,
is
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioners
at
all.
secondly,
is
their
second
basic
position,
the
government
argues
that
the
complaint
fails
to
state
an
equitable
cause
of
action.
and
they
say
that
in
essence,
although
we
started
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
the
action
would
in
effect,
if
the
court
considers
it,
amount
to
a
restraint
on
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
that
equity
will
not
ordinarily
enjoin
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
again,
it
argues
at
great
length
matters
which
we
do
not
dispute.
that
is
that
a
declaratory
judgment
action
has
to
be
tested
by
ordinary
equitable
principals.
we
concede
that,
and
i
think
the
government
believe
as
the
obvious
by
making
such
a
point
to
that
in
its
brief.
but
we
say
that
this
case
meets
the
ordinary
equitable
principles.
in
the
first
place,
to
meet
ordinary
equitable
principals,
you
have
to
show
that
the
prosecution
itself
will
present
an
irreparable
injury
far
beyond
that
which
is
normally
attached
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
what
are
the
penalties
imposed
here
upon
the
petitioners
if
they
do
not
register?
they're
criminally
prosecuted
and
if
they
are
possibly
successfully
convicted.
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
statute
are
severe
we
point
out
in
our
brief
as
many
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
entertained
declaratory
judgment
actions
or
given
injunctive
relief.
briefly,
the
petitioners
would
be
punishable
by
a
five-year
prison
sentence
and
a
$10,000
fine.
and
even
more
than
that,
since
they
are
members
of
the
bar,
being
convicted
of
a
felony
would
be
--
bring
about
considerable
damage
to
their
reputation
and
quite
likely
disciplinary
proceedings
before
their
bar
association.
now,
the
government
is
very
sanguine
about
that
matter.
there
we
fraught
to
the
present
case,
this
curious
they
say
that
there's
really
nothing
for
petitioners
here
to
worry
about
because
this
is
really
a
test
case.
they
say
an
indictment
and
prosecution
would
not
reflect
on
and
i'm
quoting
now
on
petitioner's
honesty
and
integrity,
"since
it
would
involve
only
the
legal
question
whether
their
conceded
activities
as
counsel
for
a
foreign
government
bring
them
within
the
act's
registration
requirements."
mr.
david
rein
yes,
i'm
quoting
from
their
brief.
mr.
david
rein
of
their
brief?
yes,
i
think
so.
i'll
find
it
a
little
later.
mr.
david
rein
it's
in
my
mind,
but
it
is
--
at
what?
32.
mr.
david
rein
at
page
32,
yes.
mr.
david
rein
they
say
it's
a
test
statute
and
would
not
--
a
test
case
would
not
have
any
reflection
on
petitioner's
honesty
or
integrity.
now,
we
submit
that
petitioners
here
cannot
really
feel
so
comfortable
about
the
matter.
a
criminal
prosecution
really
is
not
the
proper
forum
for
a
test
case.
and
a
successful
prosecution
here
will
not
culminate
in
the
mere
order
to
register.
it
will
amount
to
a
conviction
of
a
felony.
and
quite
interestingly
enough,
appearing
in
a
different
context
and
that
is
testifying
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
on
the
hearings
on
s.
2136
on
amendments
to
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach
took
quite
a
different
view
of
the
serious
nature
of
a
prosecution
under
this
act
particularly
with
respect
to
its
application
to
attorneys.
and
he
told
the
congress
there
that
--
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
3
of
my
reply
brief
according
to
mr.
katzenbach
as
he
testified
before
the
committee.
he
said,
"of
course
senator,
the
penalty
of
being
convicted
of
a
felony
even
if
the
fine
was
small
or
if
no
jail
sentence
was
imposed,
can
in
many
instances
be
a
very
heavy
penalty
indeed
just
simply
to
have
a
conviction."
this
is
not
true
in
the
corporate
situation
but
in
the
individual
situation,
there
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
lawyer
amounts
to
automatic
disbarment
in
most
instances.
i
do
not
know
whether
a
year
in
jail
added
to
that
has
very
much
when
he
has
that
kind
of
a
penalty.
and
perhaps
attorney
general
katzenbach
overstated
the
point
but
i
wish
to
indicate
that
when
petitioners
here
had
apprehensions
and
sought
this
declaratory
judgment
relief,
they
did
have
a
very
serious
problem.
they
cannot
simply
sit
by
and
say
that
it
was
simply
a
test
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
submit
that
the
penalty
here
is
as
great
and
as
much
an
in
terrorem
nature
as
in
the
classic
case
of
ex
parte
young.
quite
frankly,
although
as
much
as
petitioners
prize
their
right
of
privacy
here
that
absent
--
this
avenue
of
judicial
relief,
i
think
the
petitioners
would
hesitate
very
much
to
test
their
legal
rights
in
any
criminal
prosecution.
and
in
all
likelihood,
rather
than
risk
the
hazards
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
despite
the
affirmed
conviction
authority
to
exempt
and
not
required
to
register,
they
probably
would
register
rather
than
face
their
problem.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
respondent
boasts
to
some
extent
that
94
of
the
law
firms
and
individuals
have
registered
under
this
act
without
raising
a
peep.
now,
i
submit
they
were
face
with
that
same
kind
of
problem.
we
assume
here
that
they
were
under
the
act
in
which
there
was
no
question
or
they
thought
they
were
exempt
too
but
they
decided
that,
"well,
these
are
valuable
rights
of
privacy,
but
we're
not
going
to
take
a
chance."
mr.
david
rein
well,
let
me
say
that.
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
there
was
no
administrative
remedy.
the
attorney
general
said
in
his
answer
that
there
was
no
administrative
remedy.
he
says
in
his
brief
here
and
apparently
in
recognition
that
there
is
a
real
problem
here.
he
says
there
is
no
real
--
i
think
at
one
point
this
brief
said,
it
would
be
a
great
injustice
if
this
court
dismissed
the
suit
because
you
could
always
come
in
and
discuss
the
matter
with
the
attorney
general.
and
he
has
discussed
it
with
people
and
advised
them
whether
or
not
they
would
register.
now,
i
don't
think
he
suggest
that
that's
an
administrative
remedy
because
that
seems
to
me
to
be
ineffective
administrative
remedy,
we
would
have
to
have
some
kind
of
a
formal
proceeding
subject
to
judicial
review.
now,
if
there
was
that
judicial
remedy,
i
think
we
have
exhausted
it
to
the
extent
we'd
have
that
dis
--
discussion
with
the
attorney
general.
he
has
given
us
his
view
and
we
still
disagree
with
him
and
i
know
of
no
other
way.
i
would
like
to
point
out
however
and
this
is
a
matter
that
came
to
our
attention
after
we
wrote
the
brief
and
which
is
quite
significant
however
that
it
appears
in
the
hearings
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee,
particularly
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
arthur
dean,
that
the
attorney
general
has
told
some
lawyers
in
law
firms
that
they
don't
have
to
register
if
they
merely
give
legal
representation
and
not
trying
to
lobby
or
promote
anything.
so,
he
has
given
relief
to
some
but
not
to
us.
mr.
david
rein
no.
these
seem
to
be
conversations.
and
they
point
out
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
gets
to
the
point
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
weren't
going
to
raise
that
mr.
dean
also
testified
that
in
his
conversations
with
the
attorney
general
or
his
representatives,
the
attorney
general's
representative
said,
"frankly,
we
don't
understand
the
act.
we
don't
know
what
it
means
anyway
and
we
just
give
people
guesses."
mr.
david
rein
he
was
testifying
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
and
appearing
on
behalf
of
himself
as
someone
interested
in
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
mr.
david
rein
where
does
that
appear?
its
hearings
on
the
--
before
the
committee
on
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
senate,
88th
congress,
first
session
on
s.2136
to
amend
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
of
1938
as
amended,
mr.
dean's
testimony
specifically
appears
at
--
mr.
david
rein
it's
quoted
in
the
brief
and
we
cite
it
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor,
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
david
rein
is
--
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
12,
quoting
from
page
52
of
the
hearings,
mr.
dean
testified
as
follows,
"in
a
number
of
my
talks
that
i
have
had
with
the
department
of
justice
over
the
years,
the
thing
they
have
always
been
concerned
about
in
the
previous
law
was
it
was
so
broad
and
so
vague
that
they
did
not
know
how
to
interpret
it."
and
chairman
fulbright
commented
on
the
same
point."
i
think
you
have
raised
a
very
difficult
problem,
and
one
of
the
problems
of
enforcement
in
the
existing
law
has
been
the
difficulty
of
interpreting
some
of
these
provisions."
now,
significantly
--
mr.
david
rein
what?
mr.
david
rein
he
meant
the
law
hasn't
existed
in
the
present
law
before
the
court
today.
mr.
david
rein
he
was
contrasting
previous
law
or
i
think,
in
contrast
to
the
proposed
bill
which
the
senate
was
then
considering
which
is
s.
2136
which
has
not
yet
been
enacted.
he
meant
the
law
as
it
stands
--
what?
mr.
david
rein
yes,
he
meant
existing
law.
mr.
david
rein
the
attorney
general
says
94
law
firms
have
registers.
well,
he
--
he
says
94
law
firms
and
individuals.
i
don't
know
how
they
break
up.
mr.
david
rein
lawyers,
yes.
94
is
his
--
is
his
figures
and
i
don't
know
the
basis
on
which
they
have
registered
or
what
the
nature
of
their
representation
is.
that's
all
i
know
in
the
statistics
he
gave
in
that
respect.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
the
forms?
yes.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
these
are
standard
forms
in
which
we
attached
to
our
complaint.
mr.
david
rein
they're
available
with
the
attorney
general.
you
ask
him
what
forms
we
have
to
fill
out.
mr.
david
rein
oh,
when
they're
filed?
mr.
david
rein
when
they're
filed
and
filled
out,
they're
open
to
the
public,
yes.
mr.
david
rein
the
act
requires
that
the
information
be
on
file
with
the
attorney
general
and
open
to
public
inspection.
mr.
david
rein
we
haven't
furnished
any
information.
we
haven't
registered
at
all.
mr.
david
rein
if
we
were
asked
to
register,
yes.
mr.
david
rein
(inaudible)
mr.
david
rein
no,
no.
in
order
to
determine
--
mr.
david
rein
in
order
for
him
to
make
as
a
judgment?
mr.
david
rein
no.
he
never
said
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
i
mean,
we
didn't
give
him
the
registration
that
--
mr.
david
rein
but
in
the
course
of
our
discussions,
he
didn't
say,
"tell
me
something
in
order
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
your
representation
was."
now,
he
takes
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
if
you
represent
a
foreign
government,
you
must
register.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
in
any
as
a
lawyer.
and
then
he
has
modified
it,
and
perhaps
i'm
doing
eminent
justice
that
maybe
it
isn't
every
foreign
government,
maybe
it's
just
some
foreign
governments
and
he
would
put
cuba
in
that
category.
mr.
david
rein
because
its
--
mr.
david
rein
to
my
knowledge,
yes.
the
government
says
that
there
was
another
effort
brought
in
the
district
court
in
which
it
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
that
no
appeal
was
taken.
other
than
that,
i
know
of
no
other
case
other
than
this
case.
mr.
david
rein
but
we're
not
asking
a
civil
determination
of
that.
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
rein
because
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
because
i
think
declaratory
judgment
act
is
designed
so
that
you
can
cover
and
have
courts
determine
purely
legal
questions.
mr.
david
rein
a
coverage
of
the
act
--
what?
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
think
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
--
i
think,
it's
not
a
question
of
willfulness.
i
think,
the
only
question
before
the
court
on
this
grazes
whether
or
not
we're
exempt.
now,
i
gather
the
attorney
general
says
the
position
and
we're
willing
to
take
it
if
we
have
to.
and
i
don't
know
whether
we
would
stick
to
it
in
the
criminal
prosecutions.
he
seems
to
say
that
because
we
have
an
honest
belief
that
we're
exempt,
that
he
couldn't
convict
us
criminally.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
know
what
mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
that
seems
to
be
a
suggestion.
we
--
i
say,
it's
not
complete
assurance
to
us
because
we've
had
experience
with
the
attorney
general
may
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
take
a
different
position.
mr.
david
rein
we
may
therefore
say,
willful
means
something
else
than
he
says
it
means
here.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
rein
well,
there
is
still
one
little
--
let's
say
there's
a
factual
question
possibly
presented
by
the
fact
that
an
answer
to
our
allegation
as
to
the
nature
of
our
representation,
the
attorney
general
has
not
conceded
that
that
is
so.
he
has
simply
said,
he
has
no
information
to
the
contrary.
so,
we
would
have
to
prove
--
mr.
david
rein
the
nature
of
our
representation
--
mr.
david
rein
--
that
it
was
so
eliminated.
mr.
david
rein
now,
i
don't
whether
it
would
get
to
that,
perhaps
if
he
got
to
that,
he
would
concede
it.
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
just
--
i'm
just
asking
--
mr.
david
rein
all
we
ask
for
is
declaratory
judgment
in
our
pleadings.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
or
a
matter
of
--
that
is
saying
but
i
--
there
was
some
question
about
that
and
i
say,
we
meet
that
test
anyway.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
would
contend
that
willfulness
means
what
the
attorney
general
says
it
means
here.
that
means
that
you
have
to
believe
that
you're
under
the
act
and
there
has
to
be
some
element
of
secrecy
involved
as
the
--
under
the
purpose
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
or
that
would
be
a
question
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we're
exempt.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
get
into
that.
but
certainly
it
would
be
our
contention
that
willfulness
would
have
to
have
the
criminal
element,
the
element
of
--
of
concealment
in
--
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
statute.
we
like
to
point
out
further
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
we
bring
a
--
a
standard
case
for
declaratory
judgment
relief
that
--
and
i
think
the
government
here
concedes
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
statute
that
is
normally
referred
to
as
a
regulatory
statute
in
which
it
doesn't
involve
the
kind
of
things
normally
including
moral
turpitude
on
(inaudible).
now,
the
legislative
history
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
all
of
the
commentators
and
we
set
them
out
in
our
main
brief
at
some
length,
point
out
that
the
act
was
designed
so
as
to
permit
tests
of
the
validity
and
meaning
of
regulatory
statutes
of
this
nature,
without
making
the
risk
of
a
criminal
penalty,
the
price
of
a
challenge.
and
we
suggest
that
the
position
taken
by
the
government
in
this
brief,
that
this
is
a
test
case,
indicates
that
it's
the
very
kind
of
a
case
that
should
be
brought
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
and
we
have
further
fortified
in
that,
again,
by
further
testimony
given
by
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach,
in
his
testimony
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee.
he
there
argued
that
because
of
the
difficulties
that
the
attorney
general
had
with
the
statute,
that
he
asked
the
government,
the
congress,
to
give
the
department
of
justice
the
power
to
bring
injunctions
to
get
in
order
to
register.
and
quite
interestingly,
in
the
course
of
his
testimony,
he
said
as
follows,
he
was
asked
by
senator
sparkman,
whether
under
the
existing
legislation,
the
department
could
bring
an
injunctive
action
at
the
present
time
and
he
said,
"i
think
not
senator."
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
5
of
my
reply
brief."
there
had
been
a
couple
of
instances
of
a
declaratory
judgment
but
this
is
where
the
action
is
brought,
not
by
the
government
but
by
a
potential
defendant
and
he
has
the
capacity
to
go
into
court
and
say
that
the
government
is
threatening
him
with
a
criminal
prosecution
if
he
does
what
he
is
entitled
to
do
and
he
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
on
it.
we
do
not
have
the
same
sort
of
power.
we
suggest
therefore,
that
at
least
in
attorney
general
--
deputy
attorney
general
katzenbach's
opinion,
this
is
an
ideal
case
for
declaratory
judgment
relief.
and
in
fact,
he
represented
to
the
congress
that
you
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
argued
that
the
department
of
justice
should
have
the
same
privilege
or
bringing
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
like
to
suggest
that
the
senate
committee
did
oblige
the
attorney
general
by
introducing
in
the
provisions
of
s.
2136
which
is
a
bill
which
is
still
pending
before
congress,
a
provision
which
would
give
the
attorney
general
power
to
bring
injunctive
actions
to
get
an
order
requiring
registration.
now,
i
can
only
suggest
that
the
senate
did
not
do
the
same
thing
on
the
declaratory
judgment
side
because
presumably
they
had
been
assured
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
that
right
already
existed.
and
it
was
necessary
to
amend
the
legislation
in
order
to
permit
bringing
such
action.
mr.
david
rein
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action?
mr.
david
rein
no,
he
was
just
ref
--
testifying
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee,
saying
that
he
would
like
the
senate
to
amend
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
to
permit
this
--
the
department
of
justice
in
questions
where
they
had
some
problems
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction
requiring
registration
and
he
said,
"that
would
put
us
on
the
same
footing
as
potential
defendants
presently
are,
because
they
can
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action."
mr.
david
rein
well,
that
is
the
report
of
the
declaratory
judgment
of
the
senate
reporting
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
itself.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
we
argue
that
congress,
by
passing
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
by
relying
upon
terrace
against
thompson,
meant
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
situation
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
act
should
lie.
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
say
that
faced
with
the
present
situation
of
an
extremely
harsh
penalty,
a
statute
which,
though
--
though
apparently,
clear
on
its
face,
means
something
else
again
to
the
attorney
general
and
which
is
administered
by
him
in
a
somewhat
inconsistent
fashion
--
mr.
david
rein
--
as
shown
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
arthur
dean.
the
only
rational
cause
petitioners
could
pursue
here
was
to
bring
this
declaratory
judgment
action
and
that
is
shown
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
senate
report
to
which
justice
black
just
referred.
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
if
it
was
meant
to
cover
anything
at
all,
it
was
meant
to
cover
a
situation
such
as
the
present.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
now
as
my
last
point.
mr.
david
rein
well,
we
didn't
ask
the
court
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
we're
not
asking
--
let
me
say
this,
when
we
brought
our
case
in
the
district
court,
we
asked
the
district
court
to
interpret
the
act.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
the
judgment
--
dismiss
the
case
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
and
they
lost.
they
sought
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
sole
question
of
whether
or
not
a
declaratory
judgment
lies.
so,
i
say,
when
you
say,
we're
not
asking,
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
all
that's
before
you
--
mr.
david
rein
the
exemption
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
--
mr.
david
rein
you
couldn't
because
there's
been
no
findings
of
fact
and
it's
just
on
the
complaint.
and
i
only
make
the
point
that
when
i
say,
it's
only
before
you
that
it
--
that's
really
only
before
you
by
the
government's
choice.
in
other
words,
they
sought
an
interlocutory
appeal
because
they
thought
that
question
was
decisive
and
they
wanted
to
bring
that
question
up
alone
on
appeal.
on
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
well
basically,
we
think
that
the
issues
of
policy
underlying
sovereign
immunity
must
be
resolved
on
the
same
issues
of
policy
which
we
have
already
discussed,
which
would
permit
us
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
before
i
get
into
that,
i
wanted
just
to
discuss
very
briefly,
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
somewhat
unfortunate
pleading
problem
which
was
raised
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
government
here
and
by
numerous
flattering
references
to
what
competent
counsel
did
not
do.
now
apparently,
competent
counsel,
according
to
the
government
and
the
court
below,
didn't
plead
a
proper
case
here.
i
can
only
say
for
myself,
since
i
was
the
competent
or
incompetent
counsel
as
the
case
maybe,
i
tried
to
plead
the
case
the
best
i
could
and
i
wasn't
leaving
anything
out
at
all.
now,
(inaudible)
--
in
the
first
place
and
we
have
and
i
don't
think
it
necessary,
i
have
just
discussed
and
set
out
some
quotations
in
our
main
brief
at
page
13
about
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
rules
of
pleading
and
how
they're
supposed
to
be
construed
in
order
to
reach
the
merits
of
a
controversy
rather
than
to
put
obstacles
in
the
path
of
--
of
deciding
the
case.
and
i
think
that
our
pleadings
fairly
construed
would
permit
me
to
argue
anything
that
i
wish
to
argue
and
that
if
they
were
not
so
construed,
i
would've
asked
leave
to
amend
and
i'm
sure
the
court
below
would've
given
the
leave
to
amend.
now,
with
that
preface,
i
said
that
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
does
not
apply
here
even
under
the
strictest
formulation
of
that
doctrine.
and
that
formulation
given
it
to
by
the
government
and
we
will
assume
the
formulation
here,
is
that
you
cannot
sue
a
government
official
unless
you
alleged
one
of
two
things,
that
he
has
exceeded
his
statutory
authority
or
that
there
is
a
constitutional
barrier
to
exercising
that
authority.
we
say
that,
we
could
come
within
both
aspects
of
that.
we
have
pleaded
in
our
complaint
and
we
would
argue
here,
that
since
congress
has
expressly
exempted,
expressly
exempted
our
petitioners
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
the
demand
of
the
attorney
general,
that
the
petitioners
register
is
in
excess
of
his
statutory
authority
and
we
make
that
claim.
now,
i
think
that
you
can't
get
around
it
on
the
question
of
pleading
that
we
haven't
made
the
claim.
the
only
answer
that
was
given,
was
given
by
the
court
below
and
the
government,
in
the
brief
here,
is
that
the
attorney
general,
he
maybe
wrong
about
whether
the
statute
covers
us
or
not
and
we
maybe
expressly
exempt.
but
he
has
not
exceeded
his
statutory
authority
because
he
has
the
statutory
authority
to
construe
the
statute
and
to
construe
the
statute
erroneously.
well,
i
submit
if
that
argument
were
presented
and
accepted
by
this
court
that
the
exception
carved
out
in
the
lawson
case,
and
this
came
from
the
lawson
case
about
the
sovereign
immunity,
would
never
apply.
every
time
a
government
official
is
brought
before
the
bar
of
a
court
on
a
claim
that
he
has
exceeded
his
statutory
authority,
he
can
always
reply
and
i
submit,
would
always
be
replying
in
prefect
honesty
that
i
believe
i
have
that
statutory
authority.
i
mean
that's
what
made
the
dispute.
i
don't
think
we
have
disputes
in
here
in
which
officials
come
in
and
say,
"well,
i
did
exceed
my
statutory
authority."
he
says,
"no,
i
interpret
the
statute
as
giving
me
that
authority."
and
if
the
court
has
stopped
at
the
threshold
by
that
contention,
as
the
government
would
say
that
he
has
the
statutory
authority
to
construe
his
statutory
authority,
you
never
reach
the
question
of
whether
he
has
statutory
authority.
mr.
david
rein
well,
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cases
before
the
court
on
the
posture
that
we
are
right,
that's
the
way
the
case
is
brought
up.
mr.
david
rein
like
not
on
the
posture
that
it's
before
the
court
now.
mr.
david
rein
because
if
this
court
construes
the
statute
and
finds
that
it's
outside
its
statutory
authority
because
we
are
exempt
and
--
mr.
david
rein
you
don't
have
to
construe
it
but
you
have
to
assume
it.
on
the
pleadings,
this
court
has
to
assume
that
we
are
outside
and
we
are
exempt.
the
government
says
that
even
if
we
are
exempt
and
conceding
that
we
are
exempt,
we
can't
get
declaratory
relief.
i
say,
you
don't
have
to
construe
it
because
that's
already
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
we
are
exempt.
and
the
government
says
that
nevertheless,
conceding
that
we
are
exempt,
we're
not
entitled
to
relief,
that's
the
government's
position.
secondly,
on
the
constitutional
question,
it's
true,
we
did
not
raise
a
constitutional
question
originally
in
our
pleadings
and
we
didn't
raise
it
because
we
felt
that
alleging
that
we
were
exempt
from
the
act,
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
to
argue
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional.
now,
we
do
not
say
as
i
indicated
earlier,
but
if
the
act
did
cover
our
activities,
we
would
not
be
exempt.
however,
the
subsequent
history
of
this
litigation
and
even
more
clearly,
the
testimony
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
has
shown
that
as
interpreted
by
the
attorney
general,
the
act
is
hopelessly
vague
and
obscure.
and
we
would
suggest
and
we
would
be
prepared
that
as
a
criminal
statute,
it
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
give
a
fair
enough
indication
of
the
sanctions
and
its
penalties
and
the
provisions
under
the
theory
of
the
lanzetti
case
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional
on
that
ground.
finally,
if
i
may
have
just
one
minute
and
i
think
the
subject
is
fully
covered
in
my
brief
and
reply
brief.
on
the
general
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
and
i
think
this
--
i
--
we
have
pointed
out,
the
court
has
never
applied
the
sovereign
immunity
cases
doctrine,
except
in
cases
involving
property
or
specific
performance
or
funds
in
the
possession
of
the
government.
but
we
say
that
that
doctrine,
this
court
has
said
it
a
number
of
times
as
in
this
favor
and
should
not
be
extended.
we
argue
that
the
government
here
is
asking
the
court
to
extend
it
to
a
new
field
to
which
it
has
never
before
been
implied.
now,
we
made
the
flat
statement
in
our
brief,
in
our
main
brief,
that
the
court
has
never
applied
sovereign
immunity
except
in
those
limited
areas.
the
government
and
i
would
say
in
it's
--
its
brief
says,
we
were
wrong
and
has
frequently
been
so
applied
and
it
cited
one
case
in
this
court.
and
that
case,
really
properly
analyzed
does
not
involve
sovereign
immunity.
it
involved
a
completely
different
doctrine.
it
involved
the
doctrine
that
where
congress
is
vested
a
certain
power
and
administrative
authority,
there
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
set
tariff
rates
and
if
it
has
made
that
unreviewable
and
has
told
the
courts
to
stay
away,
the
courts
will
obey
their
congressional
mandate.
now,
we
do
not
understand
the
government
to
contend
here,
that
it's
not
the
business
of
this
court
to
interpret
the
foreign
agents
registration
act,
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
unreviewable
discretion
to
do
that.
all
it
argues
really
and
it
all
imposes
the
sovereign
immunity
for,
is
that
that
must
be
done
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
not
in
a
civil
prosecution.
and
we
submit
there
has
been
no
case,
where,
if
we
have
shown
that
the
criminal
remedy
here
is
not
an
adequate
remedy,
where
sovereign
immunity
has
acted
as
a
barrier
to
bringing
an
action
for
civil
relief,
where
there
is
no
other
adequate
judicial
remedy.
thank
you.
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it
would
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
i'm
not
saying
--
i
think
logically,
it
would.
judge
fahy
made
a
distinction
in
that
respect,
i
don't
want
to
give
it
up,
if
it's
persuasive
to
the
court,
but
in
all
honesty,
i
think
the
same
argument
would
apply.
i
--
i
really
see
no
difference
in
logic.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
shouldn't.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
just
stating
my
own
position.
mr.
david
rein
because
judge
fahy
did
see
a
difference.
mr.
david
rein
we
might
have
a
different
question
there.
then
you
sometimes
--
mr.
david
rein
--
had
a
slightly
different
question
of
whether
you're
trying
to
beat
somebody
outside
while
you're
doing
something.
and
that
presents
a
slightly
different
equitable
question
which
we
do
not
have
present
here.
about
running
to
the
first
--
who
can
get
in
the
first
leg
because
it's
you
which
sometimes
consider
the
factor
in
these
cases.
mr.
david
rein
i
hope,
i
don't
want
to
argue
myself
out
for
the
point
which
is
in
my
favor.
mr.
david
rein
and
i
--
no,
i
don't
want
to
argue
it.
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
to
have
the
court
make
that
distinction.
mr.
david
rein
i
assume
he
would
not.
mr.
david
rein
i
assume
he
would.--
mr.
david
rein
i
could
ask
for
that
relief
if
i
--
mr.
david
rein
--
felt
it
or
presumably.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
my
time
is
up.
