terrace
versus
thompson
which
--
to
which
they
refer
in
the
report.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
he
didn't
testify
in
that
case
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
some
report,
it
referred
to
this
quotation
from
terrace
versus
thompson.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
obliged
--
they
were
not
obliged
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property,
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
they
had
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
between
the
enjoining
the
attorney
general
from
pursuing
its
job
and
asking
to
an
adjudication
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
something
violates
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
be
glad
to
hear
you
argue
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
settle
the
law
and
whatever
the
cases
to
be
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
may
settle
the
law
without
restraining
any
government
official
from
doing
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can
go
ahead
and
try
it
and
maybe
the
court
would
change
its
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we're
not
bound
--
we're
not
bound
by
their
view
of
the
law
any
more
than
you
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
i
--
i'd
like
--
clearly
on
--
it's
your
position
that
the
act
does
cover
and
require
registration
--
cover
and
require
registration
by
a
lawyer
who
does
nothing
but
hire
himself
out
to
represent
somebody
in
a
court
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
issue
they're
tendering,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
mean
and
--
and
maybe
you're
right
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
take
much
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
talking,
they
allege
unconstitutionality
of
such
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
that
say
that
the
congress
has
here
declared
that
every
lawyer
who
represents
a
foreign
country
for
a
fee
in
a
court
below
has
to
register?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
read
this
like
you
represent
a
--
an
insurance
company,
agree
and
follow
their
cases
or
--
or
so
much
a
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
lawyer,
i'm
talking
about
a
lawyer
and
not
a
public
relations
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
none?
it
--
it
--
are
we
here
on
the
assumption
that
they
had
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
i
could
represent
any
other
client
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
happened
to
be
representing
cuba?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
then
is
on
the
merits
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they're
required
to
register,
even
though
everything
they
say
is
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
wouldn't
think
about
private,
i
just
--
thinking
about
the
difference
having
to
have
written
or
at
one
time,
between
a
lawyer
who
acts
as
a
lawyer
and
tries
cases
and
represents
people
as
a
lawyer
and
a
man
who
represents
people
as
a
kind
of
a
lobbyist
or
propaganda
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
had
assumed
maybe
that
that
was
what
this
was
after.
it
may
be
that
it
was
intending
to
reach
lawyers
as
a
necessary
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
as
a
whole
whenever
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
hire
themselves
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
acting
as
an
agent
in
what?
which
section
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
your
--
you
--
you're
standing
in
on
that
as
--
so
far
as
the
merit
is
concerned,
it's
meaning
that
if
they
represent
cuba,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
how
they
represent
them,
they
are
covered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
as
an
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
issue
is
here,
whether
the
issue
as
to
whether
they
could
have
a
test
by
this
method.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
even
though
they're
required
by
the
act
to
register,
under
their
allegations,
we
can't
decide
that
in
this
case,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
here
we
might
reach
it
because
some
of
us
might
think
it
--
they
have
a
right
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
they
did
in
terrace
versus
thompson.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
draw
a
distinction
between
the
merits
of
it.you
know
that
terrace
versus
thompson,
they
said
this,
"they
are
not
obligated
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment,
the
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
the
adjudication
of
their
right."
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
quoted
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
declaratory
judgment
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
come
in
that
--
within
that
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
was
the
irreparable
harm
that
they're
about
to
be
prosecuted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
had
to
have
to
go
though
that
before
they
could
know
whether
they'll
be
convicted
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
how
much
could
they
get
on
one
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
case,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
--
that's
not
irreparable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
ex
parte
young
is
quite
different
to
this
one.
what
could
they
have
gotten
in
terrace
versus
thompson?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
punishment
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
or
you
would
say
something
about
terrace
versus
thompson.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
about
it
so
if
you
want
to
say
something
later,
you
can
say
it.
i
fully
understand
the
policy
that
against
public
policy,
against
stopping
the
prosecutions
of
crime
well
established
in
the
law,
all
over
the
country,
in
the
united
states.
but
there's
a
policy,
have
been
declared
according
to
the
report
of
the
committee
in
these
words,
i
don't
know
whether
it
governs
this
or
not
but
it
is
interesting.
and
reporting
it,
the
--
the
committee
said,
"the
supreme
court
mentioned
one
of
its
--
meaning
this
bill,
principal
purposes
in
terrace
versus
thompson,
by
(inaudible)
when
it
said,
they
are
not
obliged
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
my
problem
--
my
question
is
this,
i
do
see
a
distinction
between
enjoining
the
attorney
general
and
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
under
this
law.
maybe
they're
not
entitled
to
get
it,
maybe
there
are
other
objections.
maybe
it's
because
they
can't
get
relief
unless
they
are
also
entitled
to
an
injunction.
but
that
seems
to
be
an
accidental
report
by
citing
an
opinion
of
this
court
where
it
said
you
didn't
have
to
show
irreparable
damages,
and
didn't
have
to
show
that
you
want
an
injunction,
they
referred
to
that
also.
what
they
have
said
in
this
report
is
that
the
act
is
supposed
to
give
a
man
a
right
as
i
understand
it,
feeling
this
case
exactly,
and
unless
there
are
other
things
in
the
context.
if
a
man
is
about
to
be
prosecuted
for
a
crime,
serious
crime,
and
the
--
the
only
way
he
can
get
it
tested
to
see
whether
or
not
he
has
to
obey
it,
he
can
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
that
that
is
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
doesn't
limit
it,
the
use
of
property
and
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
wouldn't
have
any
sympathy
with
the
law
that
said
that,
"you
didn't
have
to,
you
could
go
ahead
and
get
your
protection
but
you
rather
do
the
little
something
to
your
property."
he
couldn't
get
it
to
get
tested
if
they're
about
to
put
you
in
a
penitentiary
for
five
years.
that
would
seem
most
serious
to
me
than
take
a
little
bit
of
his
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
don't
think
you
based
it
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
sure
if
this
act
covers
it
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief,
i
read
your
brief
carefully
and
i
can't
see
where
you
answer
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
the
--
the
report
of
the
committee
is
not
by
the
lawyers
of
course.
so
unless
my
reading
of
the
report
is,
and
i'm
satisfied,
it
was
not
with
the
writer,
was
not
limiting
it
to
injure
the
property.
you're
just
saying
that
if
you're
going
to
prosecute
somebody,
this
--
one
of
the
principal
purposes
of
this
bill,
is
to
let
him
settle
it
inside
the
civil
case
without
running
a
risk
of
being
convicted
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
be
a
constitutional
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
that
shouldn't
be
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
be
right.
the
criminal
defense
are
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think,
my
brother
white
drew
a
distinction,
possible
distinction
which
may
or
may
not
amount
to
anything,
between
the
mere
statement,
i'm
not
guilty
and
a
mere
--
and
another
statement
that
the
act
just
doesn't
cover
the
category
of
things
that
you
would
charge
in
the
u.s.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
the
government
raise
the
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
placement
as
to
whether
the
act
which
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
attorneys
meant
attorneys.
