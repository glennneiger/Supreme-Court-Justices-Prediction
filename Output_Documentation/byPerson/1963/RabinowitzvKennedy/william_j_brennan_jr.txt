i
--
i
don't
follow
this
mr.
rein.
if
you're
not
covered
by
the
act,
why
isn't
all
the
rest
of
it
wholly
irrelevant?
as
i
understand
you,
all
this
business
of
what
they've
had
to
answer
if
they
were
required
to
answer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
doesn't
bear
on
whether
they're
required
to
register,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
have
to
prove
injury
before
you
may
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

--
what
case
in
this
court
led
you
to
think
you
might
have
to
prove
injury
before
you
could
maintain
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
mr.
rein,
if
you
prevail
that
the
action
lies,
there
still
has
to
be
a
hearing,
i
gather
at
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
prevail,
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
lies
on
this
complaint,
there
still
has
to
be
a
hearing,
is
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
have
to
approve
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
asked
for
injunctive
relief
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
you
did
not
receive
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
he
wants
the
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
what
--
what
was
it
you
referred
this
to,
the
one
case
that
was
here
before?
that
was
yet
in
the
life
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
indicated
that
if
--
if
no
injunction
was
sought,
then
no
proof
of
irreparable
injury
was
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
lot
of
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it,
you're
asking
this
court
only
to
decide
whether
the
action
lies.of
course,
your
next
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
is
involved
in
it.
you're
not
asking
us
to
interpret
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
say
that
it
does
or
doesn't
apply
to
your
client.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
all
before
us
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
will
--
i
--
i
gather
this
is
wound
up
a
bit
with
what
you
and
i
were
discussing
earlier.
if
there
has
to
be
a
fact
determination
whether
this
business
bring
or
this
--
this
practice
brings
him
within
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
statute.
necessarily,
you
couldn't
pass
on
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
pollak,
you
--
you
ran
a
test
illustration.
i
take
it
nothing
if
we
agreed
with
petitioner
here,
would
mean
that
any
businessmen,
merely
because
he
was
apprehensive
of
an
antitrust
prosecution
would
bring
him
without
the
government
having
indicated
any
reason
why
he
should
be
fearful.
as
here,
the
petitioner
says,
he
had
a
reason
to
fear
prosecution
because
a
demand
was
made
upon
him
to
register
but
accepted
to
do
something
like
that
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
petitioner
argue,
what
it
suggests
that
--
i
don't
understand
why
should,
that
this
would
expose
the
antitrust
laws
to
declaratory
judgment
actions
really
doing,
merely
because
follow
his
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
would
take
at
least
something
like
that,
an
antitrust
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
of
your
arguments
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pollak
--
mr.
pollak,
you
don't
answer
justice
white
if
there's
basic
public
policy
consideration
as
relying
here,
interference
for
the
prosecution
of
the
criminal
lawyers
in
civil
actions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wouldn't
think
he
was
suggesting
that.
