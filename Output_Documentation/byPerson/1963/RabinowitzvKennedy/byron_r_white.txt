justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
--
mr.
rein,
is
this
--
when
--
when
you
say
retainer,
is
this
an
on-going
arrangement
involving
periodic
payments
or
is
it
solely
a
piece
work
undertaking?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
periodically,
there
would
be
some
retainer
paid
somewhat
related
to
the
work
done
i
suppose,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
really
not
interested
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
just
that
if
--
if
your
clients'
client
has
a
--
had
the
case
here
or
some
--
some
legal
matters
that
it
brings
out
to
your
client
from
to
time
to
time
as
they
come
up
but
it's
just
--
but
it's
--
it's
really
an
honest
--
an
honest
on-going
retainer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
filing.
justice
byron
r.
white
many
who
aren't
filing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
like
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
involved
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
the
--
the
attorney
general
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
does
not
furnish
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
would
you
have
to
do
it
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
were
you
asked
to
furnish
any
in
--
in
terms
of
making
up
--
in
terms
of
trying
to
determine
whether
you
were
--
whether
you
were
required
to
register.
did
they
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
any
information
at
all
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
any
information
he
wanted
--
any
in
--
there
has
never
come
a
point
where
he
asked
for
something
you
didn't
give
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
wouldn't
most
of
your
arguments
still
follow
if,
for
example,
he
asked
you
to
register
and
you've
--
and
you've
said
to
him
--
well
i
just
--
"i
don't
think
i'll
register",
and
he
indicted
you
and
then
you
filed
a
separate
action
claiming
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
civil
determination
of
willfulness
--
of
willfulness,
the
element
of
willfulness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
wouldn't
your
arguments
apply
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
i
mean
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
the
same
threat
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
won't
this
one
get
down
--
justice
byron
r.
white
won't
this
one
get
down
to
whether
it's
sort
of
a
half
--
legal
half
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
sort
of
determination
about
whether
being
a
lawyer
is
being
mercantile
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
it
--
are
you
suggesting
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
--
you
never
could've
willfully
violated
this
act
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
rein,
if
--
if
there
were
--
if
you
win
this
case
and
then
there
is
a
hearing
as
to
whether
you
should
or
must
register
and
it's
determined
that
you
must.
and
you
register
but
then
you
were
indicted
for
having
failed
in
the
past
to
do
so,
what
about
willfulness
in
that
--
willfulness
in
that
situation?
in
short,
my
real
question
is
what
is
willfulness
under
this
statute
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
will
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
would
also
hold
if
the
attorney
general
had
gone
ahead
and
then
--
and
brought
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
have
to
register?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
its
lawyer
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
imposed
or
what
bar
has
really
been
(inaudible)
bringing
a
civil
action
where
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
need
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pollak,
why
--
why
does
the
department
or
--
or
why
do
you
think
allowing
a
civil
action
in
this
case,
why
the
petitioner
would
do
such
damage
to
the
law
enforcement
activities
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
wouldn't
happen
in
a
case
when
you've
already
made
the
approach
and
then
insisted
that
these
people
register.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pollak
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
arguments
you've
given
as
to
why
it
would
greatly
interfere
with
the
functions
the
attorney
general
seemed
to
me
to
wash
out
once
he
indicts
and
why
wouldn't
--
if
--
if
there's
in
indictment,
why
can't
the
--
why
can't
the
determination
be
made
in
a
civil
action
if
it
were
brought
on
the
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that
but
i
just
wondered
what
would
--
really
what
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
you
--
what
--
what
is
your
overall
resistance
really
to
having
some
of
these
questions
determined
in
a
civil
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
showing
that
just
as
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
the
attorney
general
goes
to
somebody
and
says
you
register,
don't
you
think
there's
some
difference
between
going
into
a
civil
--
into
the
court
and
saying
the
statute
doesn't
cover
this
and
saying
that
i
didn't
violate
the
statute?
and
isn't
there
some
real
difference
here
between
the
kind
of
question
that
--
as
attempted
to
be
brought
up
in
a
civil
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
they
--
what
if
here,
the
--
the
attorney
general
said
that
you
must
register,
you
represent
cuba.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
the
potential
registrees
says,
"i
don't
represent
cuba
at
all,
and
i
want
to
go
into
court
in
--
in
this
--
into
a
civil
action
and
have
a
declaratory
judgment,
this
statute
doesn't
apply
to
me",
or
that,
"i
am
not
violating
the
statute."
was
that
the
same
kind
of
a
question
that
--
that
is
involved
here
that
this
statute
just
doesn't
happen
to
reach
lawyers
representing
a
foreign
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
in
both
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
--
a
more
reason
though
in
the
case
that
you
have
today
and
to
--
for
a
civil
action
then
in
the
case
i
posed?
