may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl

(inaudible)
chief
justice

(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
that
the
attorney
general
has
gone
beyond
the
provisions
of
the
act
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
requiring
this
questionnaire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
asking
anyone
--
anyone
these
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
only
--
only
because
of
what
you
claim
your
particular
employment
is
that
he
has
no
right
to
ask
you
all
these
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
register
at
all,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
instead
of
--
of
warning
the
petitioner
that
he
intended
to
--
to
prosecute
him,
he
--
he
actually
did
prosecute
him.
would
there
be
any
relief
from
that
sort
of
declaratory
judgment
or
--
or
in
any
other
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
i
thought
you
said
that
your
--
your
action
was
premised
on
the
fact
that
he
--
he
threatened
to
bring
the
action
against
you.
suppose
he
had
not
threatened,
would
you
still
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
act
itself
is
enough
threat?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
quoted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
as
available
to
the
public,
are
they
public
documents
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
the
forms
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
they're
not
filed
on
a
confidential
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
open
to
the
public.
chief
justice
earl

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren

think
i
should
study
that
--
we'll
finish
this
case
tonight.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
mr.
pollak.
we'll
adjourn.
