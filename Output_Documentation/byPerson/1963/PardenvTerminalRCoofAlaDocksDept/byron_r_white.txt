they
consented.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
--
even
in
--
even
the
--
even
in
the
eleventh
amendment
cases,
they
say
that,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
just
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
do
a
little
construing
before
you
can
make
your
statement
so
confidently.
you
have
to
first
exclude
from
the
judicial
power
vested
in
the
federal
courts
the
kind
of
cases
that
you
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
suits
for
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
--
and
why
--
why
not?
justice
byron

because
of
--
because
they
could
condition
--
because
they
could
--
they
could
condition
entry
upon
the
--
this
was
consent
by
the
states
to
--
when
they
entered
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
assumes
the
constitution
said
something
about
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
true
in
the
safety
appliance
act.
that's
already
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
already
been
decided
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
in
here
technically
speaking,
and
then
you
just
have
a
defense.
justice

(inaudible)
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
certificate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
the
condition
to
granting
a
certificate.
but
insists
that
the
railroad
answer
up
to
--
submit
itself
to
the
same
regulatory
--
the
regulatory
scheme
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hasn't
been
done
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
a
certificate
to
the
icc
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
of
the
grievance
settled
this
by
the
adjustment
board
or
not?
justice
byron

white
who
went
--
who
went
to
the
board
(inaudible)
the
states?
the
union
or
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
an
administrative
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
subject
to
court
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
different
from
workmen's
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that?
is
that
citation
in
your
brief?
