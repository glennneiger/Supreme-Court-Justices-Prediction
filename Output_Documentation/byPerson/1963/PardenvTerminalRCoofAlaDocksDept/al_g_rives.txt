mr.
al
g.
rives
mr.
chief
justice,
all
the
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
your
honors.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
alabama,
who
is
an
employee
of
a
common
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
by
railroad
is
deprived
of
his
remedy
of
a
suit
for
personal
injuries
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
such
railroad
is
owned
by
the
state
of
alabama
and
which
state
invokes
a
claim
of
immunity
from
such
a
suit.
the
case
is
brought
here
for
this
question
to
be
reviewed
by
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
issued
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
held
the
state
of
alabama
was
constitutionally
immune
from
such
suit
and
had
not
waived
such
immunity.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
these,
the
state
of
alabama
is
authorized
by
its
constitutional
amendments
and
by
legislative
enactment,
to
own
and
operate
the
terminal
railway
of
the
state
docks
department.
the
legislative
enactment
provides
that
the
terminal
railway
is
under
a
duty
to
negotiate
working
agreements
with
its
employees
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
and,
that
the
state
of
alabama
through
the
state
docks
commission,
will
operate
this
terminal
railway
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
common
carrier.
it
operates
an
interchange
yard
where
it
exchanges
cars
with
the
northern
national
railroad
company,
the
gulf
mobile
&
ohio
railroad
company,
the
southern
railway
company
and
the
alabama,
tennessee
and
northern
railroad
company.
it
has
extensive
truckage
that
it
uses
to
serve
a
number
of
private
industries.
it
moves
freight
for
hire
and
profit.
it
is
a
common
carrier
by
a
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
it
makes
reports
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
concerning
injuries
suffered
by
its
employees.
it
keeps
its
accounting
records
so
as
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
an
agreement
between
the
terminal
railway
and
the
railroad
brotherhood,
they
provide
as
follows,
employees
must
not
make
any
statement
either
or
a
writ
concerning
any
acts
of
claim
or
sue,
in
which
the
--
the
company
is
or
maybe
involved
to
any
person
other
than
authorized
representative
of
the
railway
without
permission
except
in
cases
arising
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
otherwise
known
as
an
act
relating
to
the
liability
of
common
carriers
by
railroad
to
their
employees
in
certain
cases.
so
it
would
be
seen
from
the
agreement
or
contract
between
the
railway
and
the
railroad
brotherhood.
they
provided
for
or
at
least
contemplated
suits
against
the
terminal
railway.
and
they
provided
for
or
at
least
contemplated
cases
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
petitioners
are
employees
of
the
terminal
railway.
they
were
injured
in
line
of
duty
while
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
they
brought
suit
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
mobile,
alabama.
the
state
of
alabama
moved
to
dismiss
the
suits
of
the
petitioners
claiming
immunity
from
such
suits
and
claiming
that
they
could
not
be
maintained
in
the
united
states
district
court.
petitioners
contend
that
the
state
of
alabama
by
accepting
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
delegated
to
the
congress
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
between
the
several
states,
and
thereby
surrender
its
rights
of
sovereignty
on
that
power
that
was
granted
to
the
congress.
now,
chief
justice
marshall
in
gibbons
versus
ogden
had
this
to
say
about
the
power
to
regulate
such
commerce,
we
are
now
arrived
at
the
enquiry.
what
is
this
power?
it
is
the
power
to
regulate.
that
is
to
prescribe
the
rule
by
which
commerce
is
to
be
governed.
this
power
is
complete,
in
itself,
and
maybe
exercised
to
its
utmost
extent.
the
congress,
in
the
exercise
of
this
power
granted
to
the
--
to
it
by
the
states
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
enacted
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
which
provides
that
every
common
carrier
by
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
shall
be
liable
to
such
--
to
any
employee
of
such
carrier
while
engaged
in
such
commerce
for
any
injury
resorting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
negligence
of
the
officers,
agents
or
employees
of
the
carrier
or
by
reason
of
any
defect
or
insufficiency
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
carrier
and
its
cars,
engines,
track,
roadbed
works
or
other
equipment.
and,
also
provided
that
the
right
thereunder
--
for
the
right
thereunder
suit,
could
be
maintained
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
congress,
also
in
the
exercise
of
this
power
granted
to
it
under
the
commerce
clause,
adopted
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
which
applies
to
any
common
carrier
engaged
to
interstate
commerce
by
railroad,
and
also
enacted
the
railway
labor
act,
which
applies
to
any
carrier
by
railroad
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
this
court
in
united
states
versus
california,
held
that
a
state
owned
railroad
in
the
state
of
california,
were
subject
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
this
court,
in
california
versus
taylor,
held
that
that
same
state
owned
railroad
in
the
state
of
california
were
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
al
g.
rives
that's
true
your
honor,
it
--
it
--
yes
sir.
that
is
--
that
--
that's
the
reason.
this
--
this
is
the
first
time
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
state
owned
railroad
is
subject
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes
sir,
it
is
this.
yes
sir.
now,
i
decide
to
quote
this
court
from
--
from
united
states
versus
california
as
follows."
the
sovereign
power
of
the
states
is
necessarily
diminished
to
the
extent
of
the
grants
of
power
to
the
government
--
to
the
federal
government
in
the
constitution.
california,
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
by
rail,
has
subjected
itself
to
the
commerce
power
and
is
liable
for
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
as
are
other
carriers.
no
convincing
reason
is
advanced
why
interstate
commerce
and
persons
and
property
concerned
in
it
should
not
receive
protection
of
the
act,
whenever
a
state
as
well
as
a
privately
owned
carrier
brings
itself
within
the
sweep
of
the
statute.
or
why
its
all
embracing
language
should
not
be
deemed
to
afford
that
protection.
you
further
state
that
since
the
section,
which
as
we
have
held
imposes
the
liability
upon
the
state
and
privately
owned
carriers
alike,
also
provides
the
remedy
and
designates
the
manner
and
the
court
in
which
the
remedy
is
to
be
pursued,
we
think,
the
jurisdictional
provisions
are
as
applicable
to
suits
brought
to
enforce
the
liability
of
states
as
to
those
against
the
privately
owned
carriers
and
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction.
now,
this
court,
in
california
versus
taylor,
said
the
fact
that
the
congress
shows
to
phrase
the
coverage
of
the
act,
which
will
involve
the
railway
labor
act,
in
all
embracing
terms,
indicates
that
state
railroads
were
included
within
it.
now,
the
jones
act
and
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
have
like
nature
and
in
petty
versus
tennessee,
the
missouri
bridge
commission,
the
court
said
we
--
finally,
we
can
find
no
more
reason
for
accepting
state
or
by
a
state
corporation
from
employer
as
used
in
the
jones
act
then
we
could
for
accepting
them
from
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
in
u.s.
versus
california
or
the
railway
labor
act
in
california
versus
taylor.
the
california
district
court
of
appeals,
in
maurice
versus
state
held
that
this
state
owned
railroad
in
california
is
subject
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
it
said,
it
would
be
a
strange
situation
indeed
if
the
state
could
be
held
subject
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
liable
for
a
violation
thereof,
and
yet
could
not
be
sued
without
its
expressed
consent.
the
state
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
and
thereby
subjecting
itself
to
the
act,
must
be
held
to
have
waived
any
right
it
may
have
had
arising
out
of
the
general
rule
that
a
sovereign
state
may
not
be
sued
without
its
consent.
now,
judge
brown
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
at
bar,
in
his
special
concurring
opinion,
had
this
to
say,
case
at
bar,
"what
this
presents,
is
the
anomaly
of
a
clear,
legal
right
without
any
effectual
means
of
enforcement."
and
what
the
petitioners
are
here
for
is
to
ask
this
court
to
say
that
not
only
do
these
petitioners
have
a
clear
legal
right,
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
but
the
--
that
petitioners
also
have
a
clear
legal
remedy
to
enforce
that
clear
legal
right."
mr.
al
g.
rives
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
the
matter
that
mr.
justice
white
was
discussing
with
mr.
darby
about
this
remedy
under
the
state
board
of
adjustment,
that
--
that
act
says
that
the
rules
of
chapter
5
of
title
26
of
the
court
of
alabama
as
to
liability
are
to
be
filed
in
claims
for
personal
injury
or
death
of
the
employees
of
the
state
of
alabama
or
of
any
of
its
agencies,
commissions,
boards,
institutions
or
departments.
and
then
section
26
says
that
--
shall
not
--
that's
the
workmen's
compensation
act,
shall
not
be
construed
or
held
to
apply
to
any
common
carrier
doing
an
interstate
business
while
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
so
they
say
that
they
are
providing
a
remedy
for
the
petitioners
under
the
state
board
of
adjustment
act
which
puts
liability
on
the
basis
of
liability
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
and
the
workmen's
compensation
act
specifically
excludes
coverage
to
employees
of
common
carriers
engaged
in
state
commerce.
so
we're
at
their
mercy,
we
have
no
means
of
review
in
any
court
as
he
admits.
mr.
al
g.
rives
i
--
i
understand
that
they
voluntarily
will
pay
him
according
to
the
schedule
under
workmen's
compensation
act.
and
i
think
the
maximum
that
can
be
recovered
in
any
kind
of
a
case
under
that
act
is
about
$90,
some
odd
$100.
but,
we
take
this
position
that
--
that
these
petitioners
are
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
--
and
this
method
of
--
of
compensating
these
employees
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
section
55
of
fela
says,
“any
contract,
rule,
regulation
or
device
whatsoever
the
purpose
of
which
would
be
to
enable
any
common
carrier
to
exempt
itself
from
any
liability
pleaded
by
the
chapter,
shall
to
that
extent
be
void."
so
--
so
this
--
this
scheme
or
method
that
they
have
devised
is
absolutely
void
according
to
the
fela.
now
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes
sir.
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes
sir.
that's
our
contention,
mr.
justice
black.
and
referring
to
article
iii
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
no,
sir.
i'll
go
into
that.
referring
to
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
the
eleventh
amendment
in
hans
versus
louisiana,
your
petitions
raised
jurisdiction
of
their
case
under
fela
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
that
portion
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
that
extends
its
judicial
power
to
cases
arising
under
the
lowest
of
the
united
states.
your
petitioners
did
not
base
jurisdiction
on
that
portion
of
article
iii
that
extends
judicial
power
to
controversies
between
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state.
now,
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
add
to
or
take
from
the
jurisdiction
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
that
extends
the
judicial
power
to
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
it
merely
undertakes
to
grant
immunity
to
a
state
in
a
case
of
a
citizen
of
one
state
suing
another
state.
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
express
it,
gives
such
immunity
to
the
state
in
a
suit
commenced
by
--
against
the
state
by
its
own
citizen.
but,
the
state
of
alabama
cites
hans
versus
louisiana.
well,
hans
was
a
resident
or
citizen
of
state
of
louisiana.
and
he
brought
suit
against
his
own
state.
it
was
--
it
was
on
some
coupon
bonds
that
--
that's
been
issued
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
--
he
sought
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
court
on
the
basis
that
his
case
arose
out
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
because
he
was
going
to
--
in
--
in
prosecuting
his
case,
he
was
going
to
rely
on
that
part
of
the
constitution
about
the
impairment
of
contracts
to
support
his
case.
of
course
hans,
this
case
did
not
involve
a
--
a
case
arising
out
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
provision
in
the
constitution
was
never
to
be
used
by
hans
in
support
of
his
cause
of
action.
and
that's
--
should've
the
state
of
louisiana
invoke
its
con
--
its
immunity
and
--
and
hans
won.
there
was
no
side
question
involved
in
hans.
mr.
al
g.
rives
well,
i
think
our
position
would
be
much
weaker.
mr.
al
g.
rives
well,
unless
we
go
back
to
the
matter
of
the
state
of
alabama
when
it
accepted
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
completely
surrendered
its
sovereign
immunity
insofar,
that
it
related
to
the
power
of
the
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
and
as
we
say,
that
power
not
only
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
--
to
create
a
legal
right
but
also
it
gives
to
congress
the
power
to
create
a
legal
remedy.
mr.
al
g.
rives
i
think
that's
a
matter
of
--
of
immunity
rather
than
--
than
jurisdiction
or
of
power.
it
seems
to
me
like
we
--
we
--
and
--
i
might
say
this
your
honor
that
--
that
hans
versus
louisiana
and
none
of
the
cases
following
hans
versus
louisiana,
involved
a
case
where
the
cause
of
action
was
created
by
the
congress
under
power
that
was
delegated
to
the
congress
by
the
states
under
the
commerce
clause.
and
--
and
we
claim
that
that's
the
difference
between
hans
versus
louisiana
and
our
case
and
that
our
--
and
that
--
and
the
judicial
power
to
our
case
comes
in
the
first
part
of
article
iii
that
gives
judicial
power
to
a
--
a
case
arising
under
the
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
al
g.
rives
well,
i
think
that
--
that
any
rights
that
the
state
of
alabama
would
have
under
the
eleventh
amendment
that
you've
mentioned,
it
--
it
might
be
called
constitutional
immunity.
but
if
it
is
constitutional
immunity,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
petty,
he
said
this,
that
when
--
when
the
court
in
1793
held
that
a
state
could
be
sued
in
the
federal
court
by
citizen
of
another
state
citing
chisholm
versus
georgia.
the
eleventh
amendment
was
passed
precluding
it.
but,
this
is
an
immunity
which
a
state
may
waive.
now,
we
say
this,
that
if
--
if
there
is
any
immunity
by
virtue
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
could
either
be
surrendered
or
waived.
it's
not
dealing
with
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
it's
dealing
with
a
manner
of
immunity.
now,
as
i
say,
we
--
we
contend
that
the
state
of
alabama
did
voluntarily
surrender
that
sovereign
immunity
that
it
had
from
suit
in
accepting
the
commerce
clause.
but
if
it
didn't
surrender
it
at
the
time
the
state
of
alabama
accepted
the
commerce
clause,
then
it
surrendered
it
or
it
waived
it
later.
when
a
few
years
ago
the
state
of
alabama
adopted
an
amendment
to
its
own
constitution
which
authorized
the
state
of
alabama
to
engage
in
this
type
of
business
and
under
that
constitutional
amendment,
it
delegated
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
alabama
the
power
and
the
authority
to
enact
appropriate
laws
for
the
state
to
engage
in
this
business
and
this
--
and
--
and
the
people
of
alabama
by
constitutional
amendment
authorized
this
business.
and
then
--
but
they
turned
it
over
to
the
legislature
by
the
amend
--
on
--
by
the
constitutional
amendment.
they
gave
all
these
power
to
the
legislature
then
the
legislature
proceeds
to
enact
statutes
that
says
that
the
state
will
operate
these
--
these
facilities
through
a
states
docks
department.
and
if
they
do,
it
should
be
their
duty
to
negotiate
these
working
agreements
on
the
railway
labor
act,
and
that
the
legislative
act
says,
"and
operate
this
railroad
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
common
carriage."
now,
we
submit
that
that
action
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
alabama
who
delegated
it
by
constitutional
amendment
to
the
legislature
and
constituted
it
either
a
surrender
of
sovereignty
and
supported
this
manner
of
--
of
interstate
commerce.
or
if
they
didn't
surrender
it,
they
certainly
waived
it
and
then
we
add
on
couple
of
the
constitutional
amendment
and
the
legislative
enact
the
conduct
of
the
state
of
alabama
under
the
constitutional
amendment
and
the
legislative
enactment
and
what
did
they
do?
they
--
here
are
the
things
they
did.
they
operated
the
railroad
as
authorized
as
a
common
carriage
in
the
interstate
commerce.
they
actually
entered
into
agreements
under
the
railway
labor
acts.
they
did
all
of
these
things
that
mr.
darby
as
a
representative
of
the
state
of
alabama
admits
even
going
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
with
their
grievances.
complying
with
the
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
imposed
written
working
conditions
in
the
form
of
--
of
a
writing
relating
to
the
--
the
conditions
under
which
the
employees
would
divulge
information
relating
to
--
to
cases
under
the
federal
employees
liability
act.
and
suits
--
all
of
these
things
may
it
please
the
court
we
contend,
constitute
either
a
surrender
of
their
sovereignty
or
their
sovereign
right
of
immunity
as
to
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
--
yes
sir.
mr.
al
g.
rives
your
honor
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
here
is
what
--
they
--
the
only
thing
that
--
all
i
know
is
that
--
that
this
court
and
all
the
courts
that
had
anything
to
do
whether
have
held
this
state
owned
railroad
in
california
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
has
held
that
railroad
liable
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
now,
that
is
the
only
case
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
that's
--
that's
a
state
appellate
court.
mr.
al
g.
rives
now
then
louisiana
has
held
that
railroad
terminal
is
operated
by
the
city
of
new
orleans.
and
the
court
of
louisiana
has
held
that
--
that
there
under
the
fela
and
the
one
in
charleston,
south
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
i
--
as
i
recall,
on
the
basis
that
they
engaged
in
a
--
in
a
--
as
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
interstate
commerce
they
therefore
subjected
themselves
to
the
fela.
i'm
--
i'm
not
too
sure
about
that
but
i
--
i
know
that's
true
of
the
california
case
and
i
think
it's
true
of
lou
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
your
honor.
you
mean
of
about
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
well,
california
pleaded
--
pleaded
that
they
had
no
right
to
--
they
had
not
consented
to
be
sued,
or
couldn't
be
sued.
they
erased
all
of
these
things
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
raised
it.
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes,
sir.
that
was
maurice
versus
state.
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes,
sir,
it's
in
our
brief.
it
--
mr.
al
g.
rives
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
al
g.
rives
yes
sir.
mr.
al
g.
rives
that's
right.
mr.
al
g.
rives
except
that
--
unless
they
surrendered
it
when
they
accepted
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
al
g.
rives
he
said
what
--
what
this
case
presents
is
a
situation
(inaudible)
would
have
a
strange
annulment
--
anomaly
of
--
of
clear
legal
right
with
any
--
not
any
effectual
means
of
enforcement.
mr.
al
g.
rives
that's
right.
mr.
al
g.
rives
well,
we
think
they
surrendered
their
sovereign
right
of
immunity
and
they
also
waived
it
under
the
facts
and
authorities
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
black.
