mr.
wills
c.
darby
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
all
cases
that
we
have
found,
where
the
question
of
immunity
of
a
state
from
suit
has
been
raised
in
the
federal
courts
involving
a
private
citizen,
either
of
that
particular
state
or
of
a
sister
state,
all
of
these
cases
arise
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
it
would
actually
be
impossible
to
have
the
case
--
it
did
not
so
arise
where
a
citizen
was
involved
due
to
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
diversity
of
citizenship
between
a
state
and
any
of
the
citizen
as
they
state
itself
has
been
held
by
this
court
not
be
a
citizen.
therefore,
all
cases
which
we
have
cited
and
all
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
are
in
point
insofar
as
the
question
arises
out
of
the
constitution,
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
--
we
--
we
do
not
think
and
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
as
well
known
in
the
law,
in
this
country
insofar
as
the
proposition
which
we
argued
before
the
court
today
and
that
is
that
a
state
can
not
be
sued
in
a
federal
or
any
other
court
without
it's
consent.
some
examples
of
the
cases
of
this
court
that
show
the
extent
of
that
well
bounded
rule,
we
submit
are
some
of
these.
in
beers
versus
arkansas,
the
state
had
enacted
a
law
that
allowed
it
to
be
sued
in
its
own
court.
a
suit
was
filed
in
the
court,
thereafter
--
and
after
the
suit
was
filed,
the
state
changed
this
law
and
the
court
--
a
court
there
held,
the
state
court
held
that
the
immunity
was
thereby
--
well,
the
waived
ones
was
taken
back
and
this
court
affirms
saying
that
the
court
that
rather
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
change
it's
own
law
with
respect
to
immunity
even
after
a
suit
was
filed
as
they
had
an
unconditional
right
to
withhold
the
waiver
of
their
immunity.
in
the
case
of
ford
motor
company
versus
department
of
trade
real
estate
of
illinois,
the
plea
of
immunity
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
that
had
not
been
raised
below.
the
court
found
that
by
entering
into
the
suit
and
trying
it
on
its
merits
below,
the
state
did
not
wave
its
immunity
due
to
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
did
not
have
the
power
to
waive
the
immunity
of
the
state
of
illinois.
in
the
case
of
missouri
versus
fitts
which
we
submit
is
just
as
strong
as
the
case
here
or
at
least
for
the
appellant
was
a
case
where
the
state
court
supposedly
was
interfering
with
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court.
and
the
lower
federal
court
issued
an
injunction
against
the
state
from
proceeding
in
its
own
courts
in
connection
within
a
state.
there
again,
this
court
held
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
did
not
extend
to
a
suit
by
a
citizen
against
the
state
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
used
even
to
protect
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
the
same
is
true
insofar
as
congress
is
concern
here.congress
does
not
have
the
power
we
submit
to
enlarge
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
either
directly
or
indirectly
and
thereby
require
a
state
to
be
sued
or
as
a
condition
of
doing
anything
in
the
state
would
otherwise
have
the
right
or
privilege
not
to
do.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
true
even
assuming
that
congress
could
prohibit
a
state
from
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
by
railroad.
we
--
we
particularly
urged
upon
the
court
that
this
court
should
not
determine
on
the
record
here
and
on
the
act
of
congress,
that
congress
intended
in
any
matter
whatsoever
to
condition
states
engaging
in
the
operation
of
a
common
carrier
by
rail
upon
it's
submission
to
sue.
that
would
open
a
door
that
would
in
fact
destroy
a
state's
immunity
from
suit
because
if
congress
has
a
power
to
condition
the
states
engaging
in
the
operation
of
a
common
carrier
by
rail
on
the
states
subjecting
itself
to
suit,
certainly
it
would
have
the
same
power
in
connection
with
the
--
with
a
highway.
it
would
have
the
same
power
with
the
connection
of
the
state
using
an
instrumentality
of
commerce.
the
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
constitutionally
express
such
a
condition
insofar
as
a
state
is
concern.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
a
state's
immunity
from
suit
is
something
founded
in
the
constitution
and
whether
it's
considered
a
privilege
or
a
right.
and
this
court
has
described
it
as
a
right
that
congress
cannot
take
away
a
right
as
a
condition
of
doing
something
if
they
--
a
body
would
otherwise
have
the
right
to
do.
that
leaves
us
to
the
series
of
cases
by
this
court
where
a
state
though
it
has
the
power
to
exclude
a
foreign
corporation
entirely
from
doing
business
within
the
state,
the
state
does
not
have
the
power
to
require
the
corporation
to
waive
a
constitutional
right
or
privilege
that
it
might
otherwise
have
as
a
condition
of
doing
that.
and
this
court,
in
the
hanover
case
where
it
declared
the
first
employer's
liability
act
unconstitutional
based
its
decision
in
part
specifically
on
that
ground
because
the
court
found
that
at
that
time,
the
act
covered
the
employees
while
they
were
not
engaged
an
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
said
that
congress
did
not
have
the
constitutional
power
to
extend
under
the
commerce
clause
and
take
away
or
extend
itself
outside
of
the
commerce
clause
and
take
something
away
that
the
parties
otherwise
had
a
right
to
do.
here,
we
have
a
constitutional
provision.
or
for
at
least,
its
so
interpreted
and
the
eleventh
amendment
that
adds
weight
to
it
and
shows
that
the
--
the
people
as
well
as
the
courts
and
congress
have
particular
said
that
congress
has
no
such
power
under
any
circumstance
and
the
words
as
used
by
this
court,
they
say
the
whole
sum
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
cost
of
the
state
for
the
federal
government
does
not
extent
to
a
suit
by
a
citizen
against
his
owns
state
or
by
a
sister
state.
so
congress
can't
add
to
the
constitution
even
if
it
desired
to
do
so
by
way
of
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
--
petition
or
otherwise.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
well
we
--
we
have
congress
or
the
court
has
conserved
most
every
type
of
case
we
submit.
hans
versus
louisiana
was
a
constitutional
question,
it
was
a
question
of
the
impairment
of
contract
which
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
constitution.
you
have
ex
parte
new
york
that
was
an
admiralty
case
involving
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
and
there
again,
the
court
held
that
even
though
at
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction,
one
specifically
included
in
the
constitution
that
it
was
not
going
to
hold
that
the
state
could
be
sued
under
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
and
we
submit
that
in
substance,
this
court
has
already
held
that
it
is
all
inclusive.
the
court
has
not
held
on
the
question
of
a
condition
other
than
in
the
hanover
case
and
it
was
not
classified
as
a
condition
there.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
well,
we
have
no
question
about
the
suits
about
the
united
states.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
in
united
states
versus
texas
many,
many
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
united
states
could
bring
a
suit
because
the
united
states
would
not
be
covered
in
the
eleventh
amendment
and
it's
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
i
don't
think
it
was
based
on
--
i'm
sure
that
it
was
consent
because
everything
in
the
constitution
itself
would
be
based
on
consent
by
the
states
or
at
the
time
that
either
entered
or
when
the
constitution
was
written.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that's
true.
but
what
the
--
but
you
have
a
direct
prohibition
in
the
constitution
and
the
eleventh
amendment
and
it's
been
interpreted
although
by
this
court
to
include
any
other
type
of
suit
in
suits
brought
by
a
citizen
against
his
own
state.
because
the
court
says
that
was
unheard
of
in
the
law
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
the
court
as
late
as
1934
in
monaco
versus
mississippi.
again
reiterated
that
that
was
something
it
was
unheard
of
in
the
common
law
and
that
he
did
--
and
that
the
whole
sum
again
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
just
did
not
extend
to
such
a
suit.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
i
--
i
perhaps
congress
could.
we
submit
that
congress
has
nothing
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
in
safe
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that
--
there's
no
question
about
the
safety
appliance
act
with
the
--
in
the
safety
appliance
act
it
specifically
provides
that
the
suit
maybe
maintained
by
the
united
states
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
--
for
the
forfeiture.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
and
we
have
no
question
about
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
sue
a
state.
no
question
about
the
fact
that
another
state
could
sue
a
state.
and
i
think
that
is
definitely
in
our
constitutional
system.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
control
over
the
states.
i
presume
that
the
united
states
didn't
have
the
file
would
go
in
and
sue
them
in
the
court
and
have
a
judgment
then
they
will
be
required
to
follow.
but
congress
here
has
not
--
did
not
deem
fit
to
bring
that
conclusion
about.
and
perhaps
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
frank
--
frankly,
i
don't
know
whether
this
jurisdiction
or
not
that
says
that
the
whole
sum
of
this
--
of
the
judicial
power
shall
not
be
so
construed.
now
what
--
whether
it
is
actually
jurisdictional
or
whether
it
is
a
question
of
a
plea
coming
in
that's
an
absolutely
plea
when
you
bring
it
in.
i
frankly
cannot
say
but
i
realized
that
you
cannot
create
jurisdiction
by
consent.
and
if
that
stands
on
the
basis
on
the
bottom
that
you
have
to
say
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
we
--
we
would
submit
this
before
the
court,
it
would
determine
that
congress
here
has
held
that
the
state
has
intended
that
a
state
could
be
sued
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
there
are
things
that
should
be
considered
and
we
think
congress
would've
have
considered
them
and
get
the
issue
ever
been
brought
before
congress.
insofar
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
you
have
the
federal
tort
claims
act
there.
of
course
you
have
a
--
congress
has
held
that
you
do
not
have
a
jury.
certainly,
they
would
enter
to
the
same
consideration
if
a
state
was
going
to
be
subject
to
suit.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
yes,
it
does.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
it
--
it
holds
a
certificate,
it
keeps
its
accounting.
it
files
reports
with
the
icc
--
mr.
wills
c.
darby
we
submit
that
it
could
not
if
it
--
if
it
attempted
to
do
so,
we
would
probably
have
another
case
in
this
court
if
this
court
would
consent
to
hearing
the
case.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
it
has
not
been
done
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
question
about
it.
we
also
pay
taxes
to
the
--
under
the
carrier
act
and
we
comply
with
all
of
the
other
federal
regulations.
we
do
it
voluntarily
we
submit
rather
than
through
force.
we
have
been
called
into
court
for
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
and
we
defended
those
cases
on
merits.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
oh,
we
submit
--
i
--
i
think
we
would
have
to
--
have
to
have
a
certificate
from
the
icc.
but
if
the
icc
refused
a
certificate
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
state
consenting
to
be
sued,
we
would
come
into
court
on
the
basis
that
that
was
beyond
the
powers
of
the
icc.
but
that
is
another
point
in
connection
with
that
question
we
submit
and
that
is
it.
if
--
if
alabama
is
to
be
subjected
to
sue
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
railroad,
it
should
first
have
forewarning
that
that
is
going
to
be
true
because
it
might
be
very
well
that
the
state
would
decide
that
it
didn't
care
to
engage
in
the
business
of
interstate
commerce
by
rail
if
that
would
subject
it
to
sue.
now,
that's
one
reason
we
say
that
there's
been
no
waiver
here.
we've
got
no
opportunity
not
to
engage
in
it
knowing
what
might
happen
to
us.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
we
--
we
bargained
with
our
unions.
we
have
always
settled
our
disputes
with
them
without
having
a
decision
to
run
it
by
the
board.
i
would
--
that
that's
as
far
as
we've
had
to
go
so
far.
if
the
question
came,
i'm
sure
that
we
do
go.
we
have
been
to
chicago
and
had
cases
submitted
to
the
board.
fortunately,
the
union
decided
after
we
arrived
in
chicago
that
perhaps
we
were
right
and
they
withdrew
the
grievances.but
we
didn't
put
up
any
fight
about
going.
nor
did
we
allege
that
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
the
union
went
to
the
board
in
four
more
cases.
we
have
also
been
to
the
board
insofar
as
they
--
a
reopen
of
the
contract.
that
would
be
the
national
mediation
board
as
distinguished
from
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
but
we've
also
invoked
their
services.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that
is
correct.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
it
is
a
work
that
the
--
alabama
supreme
court
has
described
it
as
a
workmen's
compensation
act
for
state
employees
and
it
is
liability
without
fault.
it
would
--
it
goes
before
what's
known
as
the
state
board
of
adjustment.
and
the
state
board
of
adjustment
as
a
--
was
a
statutory
rule
largely
that
it
awards
to
employees
in
substance
would
be
in
the
same
amount
as
would
be
awarded
for
the
same
type
of
injury
if
they
were
a
private
employee.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that
would
be
the
only
proof
required
there.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
nothing
--
no
question
of
negligence
or
fault.
it
is
in
substance
the
same
thing
that
the
united
states
has
established
for
its
own
employees.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that's
correct.
the
--
the
private
act
and
something
is
made
of
that
in
our
opponent's
brief,
they
say
that
the
private
act
says
that
it
does
not
apply
to
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
which
is
true.
but,
it
does
not
affect
the
remedy
insofar
as
the
state
employee
is
concerned
because
there
again,
the
act
does
not
apply
to
the
--
to
the
state
employee
but
the
--
the
remedy
is
set
up
through
the
board
of
adjustment
and
the
amount
is
determined
by
those
schedules.
and
of
course
they
change
from
time
to
time
always
up.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
it
is
an
administrative
remedy.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
it
is
not
subject
to
court
review.
our
cases
have
been
brought
--attempting
court
review
but
they
have
not
had
any
success
so
--
so
to
speak.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
well
no
--
workmen's
compensation
act,
yes
it
is
different.
the
amount
of
the
award
is
the
same
as
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
its
probably
subject
to
about
the
same
review
as
an
employee
of
the
federal
government
who
is
injured
and
seeks
compensation
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
mr.
wills
c.
darby
that
is
the
way
we
understand
it
and
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
it
would
not
apply.
now,
actually
whether
the
federal
government
runs
any
railroads
or
not,
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
they
do
have
railroad
engines
and
they
run
them
on
their
arsenals
and
things
of
that
type
but
whether
or
not
they
would
be
considered
a
common
carrier
that
is
taking
good
from
other
persons,
we
don't
know.
thank
you.
