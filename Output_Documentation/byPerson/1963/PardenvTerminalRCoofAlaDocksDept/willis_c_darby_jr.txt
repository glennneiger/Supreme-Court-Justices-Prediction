mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
first
we
submit
that
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
in
1908,
did
not
intend
at
that
time
to
subject
the
state
to
sue.
we
based
our
contention
on
several
things.
one
is
the
legislative
history.
the
purpose
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
is
clear
from
that
history.
it
was
to
change
the
common
law
liability
of
master
and
servant
for
those
engaged
in
the
railroad
industry.
certainly,
there
was
no
common
law
liability
in
1908
on
behalf
of
a
state
owned
and
operated
railroad
towards
its
employer
--
employees.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
in
1927.
its
when
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
the
railroad
was
started.
actually,
some
of
the
bond
issues
that
came
in
the
early
20s,
in
the
20s,
in
1927
is
the
first
year
that
it
had
any
operations
whatsoever
and
that
substantially
was
when
the
railroad
was
built.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
the
second
thing
is
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
there,
they
used
the
term
in
granting
jurisdiction
to
the
state
courts
concurrent
with
those
of
the
several
states.
but
now,
many
states
including
alabama
had
constitutional
provisions
that
did
not
allow
the
state
to
be
made
a
defendant
in
any
suit
in
law
and
in
equity.
now,
this
court
in
hans
versus
louisiana,
in
commenting
on
the
eleventh
amendment
which
we
later
rely
on,
it
specifically
pointed
out
by
using
the
term
"concurrent
with
those
of
the
several
states."
congress
could
not
have
intended
in
those
cases
to
have
granted
to
the
district
courts
or
the
courts
of
the
united
states
authority
or
jurisdiction
over
a
suit
by
a
citizen
against
his
own
state
even
though
the
cause
of
action
always
was
one
of
those
arising
out
of
the
constitution
in
laws
of
the
united
states.
there
again,
congress
and
in
passing
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
used
judicially
determined
language
when
it
reached
those
words
in
granting
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
perhaps,
in
addition
to
that,
they
--
the
appellant
here
relies
on
the
fact
that
this
court
has
found
in
connection
with
the
railway
labor
act
and
also
in
connection
with
the
safety
appliance
act
that
the
state
subjected
itself
to
those
acts
by
engaging
in
the
business
of
a
common
carrier
by
rails,
they,
as
a
substantial
fit
--
of
deference
in
the
purpose
of
those
acts.
for
instance
in
the
safety
appliance
act,
the
railroad
were
required
to
put
into
effect
on
their
cause
certain
things
that
would
join
and
meet
with
all
other
cause,
of
all
other
railroads
throughout
the
united
states.
well,
obviously
if
a
state
didn't
comply
with
that
act,
its
cars
could
run
on
the
other
tracks.
so
if
they
did
run
on
the
tracks,
it
would
cause
the
most
dangerous
situation.
alabama,
of
course,
has
complied
with
that.
those
cases
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
jurisdictional
power
of
congress
to
impose
upon
a
state
the
--
a
--
a
suit
at
the
hands
of
one
of
his
own
citizens.
there
are
those
acts
so
enforced
by
the
united
states,
it's
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
then
this
case
wouldn't
be
here
on
the
point
that
it's
here
now,
because
the
sole
point
that
the
cases
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
any
individual
can
bring
the
suit.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
--
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
that
case.
we
have
been
sued
by
the
united
states
for
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
and
we
tried
among
the
merits.
the
--
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
railway
labor
act.
there,
you
have
national
bargaining
in
the
railroad
industry
or
we
follow
what
is
done
in
the
national
bargaining
act,
a
state
statute
and
we
didn't
go
to
court
to
get
that
state
statute.
the
legislature
passed
it
on
its
own.
say
as
we
will
follow
what's
done
and
that
is
substantially
what
we
do.
there
again,
certain
suits
could
be
brought
by
the
united
states
with
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
what
we
do,
we
have
in
the
state
a
workmen's
compensation
act
where
state
employee
is
very
similar
to
or
at
least
in
purpose
to
that
that
the
united
states
has
with
respect
to
its
own
employees.
the
--
the
measure
awarded
as
employees
under
the
state
statute
and
it
applies
to
the
terminal
railway
as
to
how
--
as
to
whether
as
to
all
other
state
employees,
is
whatever
is
the
same
award
that
is
made
to
people
in
private
industry
not
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
but
in
the
intrastate
commerce
and
it
is
changed
from
time
to
time
by
the
state
legislature
and
increased.
in
some
cases
of
course,
an
employee
who
was
injured
only
because
of
his
own
negligence
working
for
the
terminal
railway
would
receive
a
recovery
under
the
compensation
statute
where
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
assuming
it
was
applicable,
he
might
receive
nothing.
actually,
it
cuts
both
ways
as
insofar
as
the
employee
himself
is
concerned.
our
--
our
main
argument
here
and
the
main
thing
we
think
before
the
court,
is
the
question
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
now,
you
can
say
what
you
will
about
the
commerce
clause
and
perhaps
the
court
said
something
about
that
back
when
it
decided
chisholm
versus
georgia.
with
that
case,
it
didn't
meet
with
the
acceptance
of
the
public
and
the
eleventh
amendment
was
immediately
adopted
because
they
didn't
feel
that
the
court
had
properly
interpreted
the
constitution.
and
in
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
--
the
people
had
used
pretty
strong
language
to
avoid
the
decision
in
chisholm
versus
georgia.
they
say
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
to
any
suit
in
law
or
equity,
commenced
or
prosecuted
against
one
of
the
united
states
by
a
citizen
of
another
state.
of
course
this
court
in
hans
versus
louisiana
found
in
substance
that
the
saying
was
true
insofar
as
a
suit
against
the
state
by
a
citizen
of
his
own
--
of
his
state
was
concerned.
the
language
in
hans
versus
louisiana
is
just
about
as
strong
as
any
language
could
possibly
be.
it
gives
state
what
the
state
should
do,
it
should
exercise
its
moral
obligation
and
provide
some
method
where
recovery
can
be
had
and
of
course
alabama
has
done
that
here
in
providing
for
a
recovery
through
the
state
law
of
adjustment.
now,
the
argument
of
the
petition
here
assumes
that
congress
has
the
right
to
condition
a
states
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
upon
that
state's
relinquishment
of
its
right
or
privilege,
whatever
you
might
want
to
call
it.
i
think
the
court
has
referred
to
as
a
right.
that
is
the
right
not
to
be
sued
in
a
federal
court
without
its
consent.
we
submit
that
congress
could
not
impose
such
a
condition
assuming
that
it
had
wanted
to
impose
such
a
condition.
we
have
a
long
series
of
cases
by
this
court
in
connection
with
taxation,
also
with
other
matters
where
a
state
attempted
to
condition
a
foreign
corporation
doing
business
in
that
state,
or
on
the
foreign
corporations
giving
away
some
right
that
it
otherwise
might
have
had,
such
as
the
right
to
remove
the
case
from
the
federal
state
court
or
to
take
away
a
property
right
from
the
foreign
corporations
such
as
the
right
to
be
treated
as
a
private
carrier
instead
of
a
common
carrier.
the
court
has
been
consistently
held
insofar
as
state
legislations
are
concerned,
that
you
cannot
condition
or
a
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state
by
the
relinquishment
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
of
a
constitutional
right
or
privilege.
or
we
go
so
far
by
us
to
have
a
case
where
the
state
required
the
corporation
to
sign
a
contract
that
it
wouldn't
remove
it.
and
this
court
struck
down
the
contract
because
it
was
obtained
under
compulsion.
but
we
submit
that
even
had
congress
intended
to
do
so,
that
congress
could
not
have
condition
the
state
of
alabama
must
be
giving
away
its
immunity
from
suit
as
a
condition
of
the
state
engaging
in
commerce
by
rail.
and
if
congress
did
intend
to
make
such
a
condition,
we
submit
that
congress
would
have
done
it
in
precise
language
as
they
have
done
in
some
of
the
labor
act
such
as
the
child
labor
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
such
as
certain
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
and
certain
provisions
of
acts
to
regulate
the
transportation
of
various
commodities
of
the
mail.
congress
knew
how
when
it
passed
the
federal
employee
--
employers'
compensation
act,
it
knew
how
to
make
that
condition.
and
we
submit
that
had
congress
wanted
to
make
that
condition
at
that
time,
the
congress
would
have
done
so
at
that
time
in
clear
and
precise
language.
and
we
submit
the
congress
did
not
make
any
such
condition.
that
leads
to
another
point.
if
congress
placed
that
condition
in
the
law,
when
that
in
1908,
when
alabama
determined
to
enter
in
into
the
interstate
business
by
rail
as
a
common
carrier,
it
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
that
in
its
legislature,
its
citizens
could
have
discussed
it
before
they
would
--
don't
have
a
constitutional
amendment
of
the
state
engaging
generally
in
the
works
of
internal
improvement
through
the
cooperation
of
a
court,
it
had
no
such
right.
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
at
that
time
would
have
thought
that
this
case
would
be
before
the
court
today
where
it
was
alleged
that
the
state
by
engaging
in
interstate
transportation
by
rail
had
for
some
unknown
reason,
waived
its
immunity
from
suit.
this
--
this
court
followed
what
was
said
in
hans
versus
louisiana
even
after
alabama
determined
to
engage
in
interstate
transportation
by
rail
in
monaco
versus
mississippi.
it
cited
it
--
this
controlling
wherein
the
principality
of
monaco
filed
the
petition
in
this
court
to
bring
original
action
against
mississippi
because
mississippi
had
defaulted
on
some
of
its
bonds.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
it
--
it
actually
was
not
a
contract.
it's
in
the
rules
of
the
terminal
railway.
all
the
railroads
put
out
a
large
volume
of
rules
and
this
is
a
substantial
volume.
i
think
i
know
how
it
got
into
the
record
--
got
into
the
book.
i
couldn't
be
sure
and
the
record
doesn't
show
but
what
the
railroad
did,
it
just
picked
up
the
elements
of
the
gm&os,
a
large
railroad
book
of
rules
and
they
copied
it
and
published
it.
if
you
read
the
whole
thing,
you
find
it
they've
applied
the
railroad
that
operate
over
many,
many
miles
and
through
many
states,
and
the
rules,
nine
tips
ultimately,
don't
apply
to
such
as
the
terminal
railway
of
the
alabama
state
docks'
operations
were
confined
to
a
very
small
area.
there's
no
question
about
it.
it
is
in
the
rule
and
i
think
that's
when
we
found
it,
it
was
in
the
rule.
it
was
when
it
was
pointed
out
in
this
case
below.
but
we
don't
think
it
had
any
particular
significance
here.
moreover,
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
alabama
which
it
has
a
constitutional
prohibition
of
the
state
being
made
a
party
defendant,
or
the
state
of
the
--
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alabama
has
ruled
that
neither
the
legislature
nor
any
official
of
the
state
can
waive
the
state's
immunity.
so
if
it
--
would
be
considered
it
by
placing
that
in
the
book,
they
intended
to
waive
or
thought
they
could
be
sued,
it
was
someone
where
state
down
below
that
put
it
in
the
book.
so
back
to
the
point
of
waiver
because
we
must
have
--
i
think
for
the
petitioner
to
prevail,
the
state
must
have
waived
in
some
manner
or
other
its
immunity
from
suit
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
--
the
level
(inaudible)
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
the
constitution
--
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
something
that's
often
puzzled
me
in
considering
this
matter
because
i
don't
quite
--
to
see
how
you
can
create
jurisdiction
by
consent
the
language
of
the
cases
of
this
court
and
other
courts
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction
but
they
all
say
that
a
sovereign
can
consent.
so
i
guess
you
say
if
it
goes
in
a
circle.
perhaps
there's
no
way
to
get
out
of
the
circle.
but
the
point
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that's
correct.
even
in
the
eleventh
amendment
cases.
and
the
eleventh
amendment
says
--
that
it
said.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
but
--
but
the
court
though,
has
either
not
read
in
--
it's
--
it's
followed
the
result
of
the
eleventh
amendment
but
perhaps
it's
used
the
wrong
words
in
reaching
it.
but
the
--
and
frankly
i
don't
know
how
in
the
face
of
eleventh
amendment
that
you
can
have
a
consent
case
where
a
state
comes
in
and
consents,
because
the
court
of
course
should
determine
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
its
own
jurisdiction.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
if
--
if
the
state
had
a
rule
of
no
sovereign
immunity,
we
of
course
would
not
be
here,
we
would
have
been
--
we
still
might
be
here
for
this
reason.
we
--
if
we
had
a
rule
of
no
sovereign
immunity,
it
might
be
that
it
will
be
confined
to
our
own
state
courts
and
we
would
say
still
the
courts
of
the
united
states
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
--
in
hans
versus
louisiana
in
substances
as
the
court
below
said,
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
eleventh
amendment
insofar
as
a
suit
by
a
citizen
against
his
own
state
was
concerned.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
what
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
--
we
would
submit
that
that
would
--
that
would
make
a
very
unusual
conclusion
that
a
citizen,
say
of
mississippi,
who
worked
on
a
railroad
was
injured
and
he
could
not
sue
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
but
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
always
determined
in
substance
that
the
eleventh
amendment
was
either
not
needed
or
implied
or
applied
in
substance
to
a
suit
where
you
have
the
citizen
suing
his
own
state.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
the
eleventh
amendment
says
nothing
about
consent.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
it
is
evident
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
there
--
there
--
there
is
not
a
word
about
consent
even
in
the
--
in
the
constitution
or
the
eleventh
amendment.
now,
when
we
rely
somewhat
or
some
of
the
criminal
cases
and
that
if
we
are
assumed
to
have
waived
the
right
that
we
have
when
we're
speaking
of
the
state,
we
must
of
course
have
known
that
we
had
that
right.
and
of
course
we
thought
we
had
the
right
not
to
be
sued
in
the
federal
or
any
other
court.
we
knew
that
part
of
it.
but
we
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
contended
at
some
later
date
that
by
engaging
in
interstate
commerce
by
rail,
by
that
fact,
we
would
have
waived
the
right
that
we
otherwise
have.
and
of
course
in
order
to
have
an
intelligent
waiver,
we
must
have
known
that
the
act
through
with
--
that
through
we
will
--
through
which
we
were
going
to
waive
what
right
we
had,
would
have
in
fact
caused
that
waiver.
and
--
and
there
again,
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
you
have
hans
versus
louisiana
which
is
fairly
clear
and
you
have
monaco
versus
mississippi
decided
after
the
state
commenced
its
operations
of
the
railroad,
which
show
that
it
was
at
that
time
at
least
or
rather
unheard
of,
that
a
state
could
be
subject
to
suit
by
a
citizen
of
the
own
--
of
his
state.
the
--
the
words
of
the
court
there
was,
and
it
was
a
form
of
action
or
a
construction
never
imagined
or
dreamed
of,
and
we
submit
that's
still
applicable
here
insofar
as
what
congress
passed
in
1908
and
also
what
still
stands
today
insofar
as
anyone
concerned
of
a
waiver.
now,
the
opponent
relies
also
on
petty
versus
tennessee
(inaudible),
excuse
me
--
petty
versus
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission.
we
submit
that
that
case
is
not
authority
here
for
the
point
there.
this
was
a
decision
by
divided
court,
three,
three
and
three.
the
majority
held
in
substance
that
by
in
entering
in
or
the
three
of
the
judges
held
that
by
entering
into
the
interstate
compact
and
accepted
it,
that
the
state
had
waived
--
that
the
state
with
the
compact,
at
least,
it
waived
any
immunity
that
it
might
have
had
from
suit.
in
connection
with
that,
the
act
specifically
said
that
it
was
a
body
covered
in
substance
and
it
has
that
power
to
sue
and
to
be
sued
or
--
we
of
course
have
nothing
here
of
that
nature.
moreover,
congress
in
the
petty
case
put
certain
conditions
of
which
there
was
a
matter
of
--
they
said
of
that
would
put
certain
condition
on
the
state
entering
into
the
compact
and
the
compact
being
approved
and
that
also
referred
at
least
as
the
majority
held
to
a
question
over
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
the
federal
court.
three
judges
agreeing
with
the
result
would
not
--
with
the
--
not
that
origin
with
--
of
the
result,
held
in
substance
that
they
didn't
reached
the
eleventh
amendment
or
the
constitutional
issue
at
all,
that
they
didn't
find
that
it
was
applicable
to
a
compact.
but
then
we
get
down
to
a
more
fundamental
difference
perhaps
here.
in
the
petty
case,
this
court
was
called
upon
to
apply
federal
law.
what
did
the
compact
mean
on
the
federal
law,
not
on
the
state
law?
and
this
court
found
that
on
the
federal
law,
that
there
had
been,
insofar
as
anything
was
concerned
a
waiver
of
the
immunity
of
the
state.
but
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
view
when
you
look
at
a
state
action,
whether
to
determine
whether
a
state
acting
in
its
own
right,
not
through
a
compact,
acting
in
its
own
right,
has
waived
anything.
you
look
then
to
state
law.
well,
there
can
be
no
question
that
in
the
state
law
that
the
state
has
not
waived
its
immunity.
and
i
think
if
