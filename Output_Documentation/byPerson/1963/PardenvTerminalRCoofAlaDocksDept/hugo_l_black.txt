(inaudible)
as
though
it
said
that
a
railroad
operated
by
state
when
the
railroad
is
up
--
for
coming
here
is
operated
by
a
state,
an
injured
person
shall
be
allowed
to
sue
the
state
under
this

law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
that
violated
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
theory
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
think
if
congress
had
passed
a
law
which
forbids
a
state
to
run
a
common
carrier
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
boils
down
on
the
waiver,
maybe
i
was
wrong
with
that,
that
it's
this.
congress
passed
a
law
within
his
power
saying
if
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
be
operated
in
certain
way
and
subject
to
certain
suits
in
courts
and
that
thereafter,
the
state
of
alabama
knowing
of
this
law
which
was
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
suppose
it
could
be,
even
now,
it
may
not
be
a
good
argument.
but
knowing
of
this
law,
it
bought
a
railroad,
took
a
railroad
over
and
decided
to
run
it,
the
state.
and
you're
saying
by
that
action,
it
--
which
in
whole
that
it
waived
this
right,
sovereign
immunity
or
to
be
sued
in
the
courts
because
it
went
into
that
business
knowing
and
under
the
supreme
law
of
the
united
states,
it
did
said
that
there
must
be
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
argument
--
and
that
here
if
there
is
not
liability
on
waiver,
the
act
cannot
be
carried
out
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
judge
brown
said
that
they
admit
it.
what
you
have
here
was
a
case
of
liability
without
a
remedy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
congress
passed
the
law,
attempted
to
fix
liability
on
all
common
carriers
without
stating
whether
the
state
cannot.
a
state
goes
into
that
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
question
is
whether
by
that
we
can
say
that
it
waived
its
right
not
to
be
sued
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
