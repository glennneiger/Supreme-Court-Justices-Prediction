mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
while
this
case
involves
many
profound
considerations
of
constitutional
law,
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
matter
of
procedure.
the
question
basically
is,
what
is
the
proper
procedure
for
a
three-judge
federal
court,
which
has
entertained
an
action,
raising
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
under
the
federal
constitution
when
it
has
remanded
the
parties
to
the
state
courts
to
secure
a
state
court
interpretation
of
the
statute?
the
question
as
to
procedure
is,
shall
the
parties
be
required
to
come
to
this
court
for
review
of
the
state
court
decision
or
may
they
return
to
the
district
court
to
complete
the
litigation
in
the
first
place?
this
case
was
brought
by
a
large
group
of
chiropractors
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
was
initiated
in
may
of
1957
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
judgment
that
the
state
medical
practice
act
was
first,
inapplicable
to
chiropractors.
second,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
in
administration
and
finally
that
as
drafted
and
as
applied,
the
statute
itself
was
a
denial
of
rights
guaranteed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
besides
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
but
basically,
fourteenth
amendment
rights
are
here
involved.
the
district
court
declined
to
prorogue
a
three-judge
district
court
as
was
requested
and
ruled
that
because
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship
and
because
there
was
no
serious
question
of
constitution
or
law,
which
had
not
been
settled,
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
decision
of
the
district
court
declining
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
that
court,
by
a
divided
bench,
ruled
that
the
complaint
made
out
some
cause
of
action
and
alleged
a
prima
facie
case
of
constitutional
rights
which
had
been
violated.
motion
for
rehearing
was
made
and
was
the
occasion
for
the
courts
writing
a
very
extended
discussion
of
the
grounds
by
which
the
reversal
was
based.
accordingly,
in
the
district
court,
a
three-judge
bench
was
convened.
the
plaintiffs
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
a
basis
of
voluminous
documentation
and
information
of
a
medical
and
scientific
nature.
the
court
heard
oral
argument
on
all
these
points
from
both
sides
and
without
consultation
or
notice
of
any
kind,
proceeded
to
announce
that
it
would
abstain
from
passing
upon
the
constitutional
issues.
some
27
years
before,
the
state
courts
had
decided
that
this
docket
was
constitutional
in
an
attack
of
somewhat
limited
but
similar
nature.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
it
makes
them
criminals.
if
they
attempt
to
practice
chiropractic
in
the
state
of
louisiana
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
and
they're
not
entitled
to
a
license
under
any
circumstances
under
this
statute.
under
no
circumstances
can
a
chiropractor
ever
qualify
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
becomes
a
criminal
while
practicing
or
attempting
to
practice
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
first,
your
honor,
because
the
state
statute
requires
that
he
take
an
examination
and
such
subject
to
surgery
and
draw
up
some
material,
medical
which
they
never
use.
second,
the
board,
which
administers
the
statute,
requires
that
no
person
can
qualify
unless
he
has
a
degree
from
a
school
approved
by
the
american
medical
association.
and
of
course,
the
american
medical
association
does
not,
under
any
circumstances,
recognize
chiropractic
as
a
type
of
treatment
or
one
of
the
healing
sciences.
the
statute,
we
--
we
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
medical
practice
act
of
louisiana
actually
does
include
chiropractic
because
it
refers
to
medicine,
all
the
healing
arts.
it's
in
very
broad
language.
it's
our
position
really
that
the
application
of
the
statute
to
chiropractor
or
to
the
science
of
chiropractic
is
not
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
but
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
i'm
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
--
i'm
going
to
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
46
of
the
50
states,
there
are
licensing
provisions
for
chiropractic.
recently,
the
state
of
new
york,
which
was
one
of
the
four
in
the
minority,
has
provided
a
licensing
statute
so
that
we
have
now
only
three
states,
including
the
new
states
of
hawaii
and
alaska,
which
do
not
license
chiropractic.
of
those
three
only
in
louisiana,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
information,
punishes
these
people
as
criminals
and
actual
enforcement
procedures,
which
my
distinguished
louisiana
associate
has
secured
within
the
band
of
an
injunction.
they
have
enjoined
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
the
prosecutions
until
this
court
or
until
our
federal
tribunals
can
settle
the
constitutional
issues
involved.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
does
cover
the
question
of
what
shall
be
exacted
of
a
chiropractor
since
they
use
no
surgery
under
any
circumstances
and
do
not
believe
in
the
employment
of
drugs
in
treatment
of
their
patients.
their
position
is
that
it's
totally
and
completely
irrelevant
to
expect
them
to
produce
that
kind
of
information.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i'm
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would,
at
this
point,
if
your
honor
please,
say
that
that
isn't
pertinent
here
and
i
mean
no
disrespect.
i
would
say
simply
that
they
haven't
constitutionally
arrived
at
that
position.
in
other
words,
i
believe
that,
possibly,
the
state
of
louisiana
or
any
other
state
could
hold
such
hearings
and
make
such
investigations
that
its
legislature
would
arrive
out
a
decision
that
chiropractic
or
any
other
type
of
medical
practice
would
be
undesirable
and
outlawed
and
the
state
might
well
adopt
such
a
policy
but
only
on
a
proper
basis
after
appropriate
hearings
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
the
parties
to
be
effected.
i
wouldn't
go
quite
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
could
not
outlaw
it.
i
simply
say
they
have
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
very
happy
to
discuss
the
merits
but
i
do
feel
that
we
have
a
tendency
to
get
sidetracked
a
little
bit
and
i
mean
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
--
i
have
no
objection,
your
honor,
except
that
the
procedural
question
isn't
an
interesting
one
and
it's
an
important
one.
it
comes
up
in
these
questions
that
involve
state
action
and
i
think
the
court
needs
to
clarify
it.
i'm
very
happy
to
discuss
any
phase
the
court
(inaudible)
in
a
court.
i
simply
think
that
we
haven't
yet
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
merits
are
pertinent
to
our
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
--
yes,
your
honor,
certainly
that's
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
--
that's
really
the
heart
of
the
question
here.
the
point
is
that
the
constitution
in
article
3
section
1
says
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
extend
to
cases
arriving
under
the
constitution
and
laws
made
pursuant
thereto
in
treaties
made
and
to
be
made
and
so
on.
this
is
the
judicial
power
which
is
exercised
by
this
court.
the
same
article
3
of
the
constitution
in
section
2
says
that
the
judiciary
shall
consist
of
one
supreme
court
and
such
inferior
court
says
the
congress
may
from
time
to
time
(inaudible)
establish.
now,
there
was
a
time
in
the
early
history
of
the
country
when
the
relative
weight
and
functions
of
the
state
judiciary
and
the
federal
judiciary
was
not
clearly
expounded
and
understood
and
so
we
had
such
case
as
cohens
against
virginia
in
which
the
defendants
or
the
appellants
by
writ
of
error
had
been
convicted
of
selling
lottery
tickets
under
an
act
of
congress
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
they
claimed
that
they
were
protected
by
the
fact
that
congress
had
enacted
this
statute
and
that
they
could
therefore
proceed.
now,
the
state
of
virginia
and
its
authority
said
that
the
federal
court
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
review
the
convictions
of
the
virginia
court
and
mr.
justice
marshall
in
a
very
learned
and
helpful
decision,
which
has
a
direct
bearing
here,
said
that
we
have
this
question
of
judicial
power
of
the
federal
government,
refers
to
the
supremacy
clause
in
the
constitution.
this
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
and
therefore,
the
federal
courts
are
vested
with
authority
to
inquire
into
any
action
taken
under
authority
of
the
states
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
state
action
measures
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
united
states
constitution.
having
decided
that
they
had
jurisdiction,
they
went
on
to
decide
that
congress
had
never
authorized
the
sale
of
lottery
tickets
in
violation
of
any
state
law
in
the
appearance
of
conviction.
but
that
was,
we
might
say,
an
original
inquiry
by
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
into
the
role
of
the
federal
judiciary.
now,
having
established
that
judicial
power,
granted
under
the
constitution,
extends
to
a
review
of
all
action
taken
under
state
authority.
the
congress,
he
then
found,
had
created
these
inferior
judicial
courts
and
invested
them
with
authority
to
pass
upon
questions
of
constitutional
right
asserted
as
a
bar
to
state
court
action
or
any
state
action.
when
that
happened,
we
went
on
from
there
to
martin
against
hunter's
lessee,
which
was
decided
by
justice
story
and
later
on
to
a
variety
of
other
cases,
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
in
which
mr.
justice
story
says,
in
effect,
congress
could
not
vest
the
state
courts
with
authority
to
pass
upon
a
federal
constitutional
right
asserted
under
the
federal
constitution.
now,
when
this
action
was
brought,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
the
state
court,
i
beg
your
pardon,
in
the
federal
court,
in
the
district
court,
it
was
an
attempt
to
vindicate
a
federal
constitutional
right.
certainly,
it
was
brought
under
a
precise
federal
statute
which
said
in
so
many
words,
jurisdiction
shall
be
vested
in
the
federal
district
courts.
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
said.
we've
cited
the
chapter
and
verse
of
the
brief.
now,
the
federal
court
after
the
remand,
mind
you,
from
the
fifth
circuit,
was
faced
with
a
binding
decision,
which
was
the
law
of
the
case
at
that
point,
to
the
effect
that
this
complaint
set
forth
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
constitution.
instead
of
proceeding
to
judgment
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
the
plaintiffs
had
every
legal
right
to
ask
under
the
constitution
and
under
the
statute,
they
said,
"we
feel
that
since
27
years
has
elapsed
since
the
earlier
decision,
we
should
not
take
it
for
granted
that
the
state
of
chiropractic
hasn't
developed
and
that
the
understanding
of
the
state
of
louisiana
hasn't
changed
and
we
feel
we
should
have
a
current
interpretation
of
the
state
statute."
they
also
said,
and
this
is,
of
course,
in
the
record
that
it
may
be
that
the
state
court
will
find
that
chiropractic
as
chiropractic
is
not
embraced
within
this
medical
practice
act.
therefore,
we
won't
ever
have
to
reach
a
constitutional
decision
or
they
may
find
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
chiropractics
and
should
not
apply
to
chiropractics
and
that
the
people
who
administer
the
act
are
acting
outside
the
scope
of
their
authority.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh,
no.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
i
don't
suppose
they
could
limit
the
state
court
nor
could
they
can
compel
the
parties
to
resort
to
the
state
court.
they
simply
said,
"we
feel
we
should
have
a
current
interpretation."
what
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
was
ignored
at
that
point
was
that
the
constitutional
law
provisions
had
been
settled
for
purposes
of
this
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh,
i
think,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
now
know
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
button
case,
we
could
have
come
right
up
here.
it
would
have
been
my
personal
judgment
at
that
time
that
since
the
district
court
had
retained
jurisdiction,
if
i
had
been
on
the
other
side,
i
would
have
filed
a
brief
in
our
position
and
said
there's
a
case
pending
below
in
the
district
court.
i
would
have
objected
to
this
court
asserting
jurisdiction,
that
is
if
i
have
been
on
the
other
side.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it
was
appropriate
and
proper.
and
i
might
point
this
out
that
in
these
cases
of
abstention,
it's
not
to
be
assumed
that
this
court
will
grant
cert
in
every
certiorari
in
every
case
where
you
wanted
to.
it's
far
better,
i
believe,
as
a
matter
of
practical
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
to
go
back
into
your
trial
court.
you
may
--
you
may
find
that
more
complete
development
of
the
facts
necessary
for
example.
or
there
may
be
some
very
great
benefits
to
be
obtained
by
discovering
procedures
in
the
district
court
and
it
would
might
have
be
--
well
be
premature
to
come
here.
we
could
possibly
have
applied
for
certiorari
but
i
would
have
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
your
honor.
the
louisiana
counsel
went
into
the
state
court
and
raised
all
the
questions.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say
this.
there
was
a
reason
and
the
reason
would
be
that
in
every
case,
the
rule
of
res
judicata
applies
not
only
to
questions
that
are
raised
in
a
particular
case
but
which
may
properly
be
raised
and
it
would
be
in
proper
procedure
to
end
a
race
all
these
questions
and
obviously,
it
was
what
the
district
court
wanted
because
they
wanted
to
know
exactly
what
the
view
of
the
state
court
was
on
the
questions
presented
by
this
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
that
that's
what
was
intended
by
the
district
court.
they
wanted
to
see
if
the
--
for
example,
we
--
we
approach
it
on
this
basis.
let's
assume
that
the
state
court
was
persuaded
by
the
eloquence
and
ability
of
counsel
and
said,
"we
feel
that
this
statute
does
violate
the
federal
constitution."
that
put
an
end
to
the
litigation
right
then
and
there.
there
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
exactly.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
now,
in
the
button
case,
this
court
said
that
while
the
court
below
has
terminated
its
action
and
retained
jurisdiction,
the
parties
may
come
here
because
they've
shown
them
a
waiver
of
any
rights
in
the
state
court
and
they've
submitted
the
entire
matter
and
come
here.
we
never
did
that.
we
went
right
back
into
the
district
court,
moved
to
vacate
the
order
of
abstention
if
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes.
we
went
back
--
into
the
district
court.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
exactly,
your
honor,
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
proper.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that's
the
way
i
recall
it,
your
honor
but
said
that
the
party
(voice
overlap)
go
back
into
the
district
court
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
--
i
emphasize,
if
your
honors
please,
that
there
may
be
great
benefits
to
be
gained
out
of
developing
the
facts
and
further
discovery
and
clarifying
the
position
of
the
two
parties.
this
presence
of
abstention
is
fine
but
i
have
to
point
out,
and
i
hope
counsel
for
the
other
side
will
confine
the
argument
to
--
not
to
the
merits
or
--
i'll
leave
the
merits
out
and
stick
to
this
question
procedure.
under
the
statute,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
congress
gave
every
litigant
or
every
plaintiff
a
right
to
an
opinion
by
a
federal
forum.
there
was
no
intention
that
the
federal
courts
could
just
slough
off
the
responsibility
imposed
by
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
and
say,
"we're
going
to
let
the
state
courts
decide
this."
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
cohens
case
said
that
if
such
would
have
be
the
case,
we
would
have
a
hydra
of
government
with
decisions
by
50
state
tribunals
or
whatever
number
there
was
at
that
time,
maybe
13,
i
think,
by
different
state
governments
on
the
same
question.
today,
we've
got
50
state
courts,
which
may
render
to
50
different
decisions
on
the
same
constitutional
provision.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
didn't
occur.
i
took
it
for
granted
and
i've
shown
my
counsel
from
louisiana
felt
that
the
proper
procedure
was
to
go
right
back
into
the
--
this
court,
which
had
regained
jurisdiction.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i'm
very
glad
to
confess
that
it
didn't
occur,
that
we
could
come
here
by
certiorari
and
have
this
court
entertain
the
matter.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
it's
my
impression,
your
honor,
i'm
not
a
louisiana
lawyer,
i
--
i
practice
here
in
the
district,
but
it's
my
impression
that
as
a
matter
of
general
common
law
that
your
--
that
is
the
court
statement
of
the
rule
res
judicata,
that
is
you're
not
only
excluded
by
or
precluded
by
the
questions
you
raise
but
all
those
which
might
properly
have
been
raised.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
that
that's
true
if
you
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
i
think
that
we
have
this
kind
of
a
problem,
if
i
may.
we've
cited
cases
here
in
the
brief
in
which
--
there's
one
case,
(inaudible)
against
the
state
of
illinois
and
was
decided
by
the
district
court
out
there
but
this
radio
announcer
was
found
guilty
in
the
state
court
of
contempt
in
connection
with
comments
he
made
on
the
air.
after
the
highest
state
court
had
affirmed
and
this
court
had
denied
certiorari,
he
was
threatened
with
arrest
and
he
went
into
the
federal
court
seeking
vindication
of
his
federal
rights.
now,
they
said
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
secure
a
review
of
the
state
court
decision
and
of
course,
the
district
court
went
right
after
that
proposition
and
they
said
this
contention
is
an
error,
where
a
constitutional
question
is
raised
by
the
act
of
a
state
officer
and
he
raises
a
constitutional
right,
then
this
court
has
original
jurisdiction
and
primary
responsibility.
in
other
words,
even
assuming
that
this
court
were
to
dismiss
this
or
affirm
the
dismissal
below,
there's
going
to
be
another
suit
brought,
which
will
be
brought
now
in
the
federal
court
and
which
will
have
to
come
right
back
up
here
through
channels
for
review
on
the
merits.
there
isn't
any
possibility
of
disposing
of
it
by
this
simple,
technical
mousetrap
device
of
saying,
"go
in
to
the
state
court.
if
the
state
court
decides
it
against
to
your
part,
if
they
decided
in
your
favor,
you
don't
need
to
come
back
into
the
federal
court."
i
mean,
it
was
an
exercise
in
futility
as
one
of
my
co-counsel
has
said.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
we
always
have
these
options
in
the
selection
of
a
forum.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
don't
think
that
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
for
this
reason.
i
hate
to
admit
it
but
it's
now
30
years
since
i
started
practicing
law
in
the
federal
courts
in
this
city
and
around
this
court
too,
and
it's
always
been
my
duty.
it's
very
seldom
i
have
an
option
of
applying
for
certiorari.
you
do
this
in
extremist.
this
court
grants
certiorari
only
when
it's
vital
and
necessary
and
important
and
as
this
court
has
many
times
said,
this
court
does
not
sit
to
correct
error.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
even
on
appeal,
if
your
honor
please,
these
motions,
the
docket
in
dismiss
have
very
summary
effect
of
denying
cert.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
the
rule
should
be
this,
if
your
honor
please,
that
when
the
federal
district
court
has
remanded
the
parties,
the
parties
should
come
back
into
the
federal
district
court
for
completion
of
the
procedure
there
and
for
decision
of
the
federal
constitutional
questions,
unless,
there
is
some
overriding
necessity
such
as
there
was
in
the
button
case
i
would
say.
it's
a
matter
of
great
national
importance.
the
views
of
this
court
were
vital
and
essential
to
the
functioning
of
the
district
courts
in
all
50
states,
let's
say,
and
i
think
there
was
probably
a
good
policy
reason
on
a
part
of
this
court
for
granting
certiorari.
i
wouldn't
want
to
depend
on
this
court's
granting
certiorari
in
any
case
where
we
were
unhappy
with
the
district
court's
decision.
i'd
like
to
reserve
of
my
balance
to
my
half
if
i
may.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
if
the
state
court
had
been
willing
to
hold
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
the
state
court
had
been
willing
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution,
we
would've
presumably
gotten
the
same
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
--
relief,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
question
about
endless
litigation
of
which
is
i'm
trying
to
--
these
parties
came
into
the
federal
forum
under
our
federal
statute
seeking
a
federal
judgment
on
a
constitutional
right
in
1957.
they
haven't
gotten
one
yet.
they're
still
fighting
procedure.
now,
if
it's
going
to
take
endless
litigation
to
get
these
rights
vindicated,
well,
i
probably
won't
be
here
but
counsel
are
growing
up
and
graduating
from
the
law
schools
and
being
admitted
to
this
bar
everyday
and
they'll
be
here
as
this
court
is
here.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
are
there
issues
which
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
at
this
very
day,
there
has
been
no
evaluation
whatsoever
of
the
evidence
offered,
none
at
all.
there
was
a
tremendous
mass
of
medical
and
other
documentary
evidence
offered
in
support
of
amalgomous
summary
judgment.
this
was
never
evaluated,
either
in
the
three-judge
court
or
in
the
state
court.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
they
said
we
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh,
they
said
this
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
previously
in
the
--
the
fife
case,
which
was
27
years
earlier
and
while
they
say
that
there's
progress
in
the
science,
we
expect
that
there's
just
a
more
elaborate
demonstration.
that's
exactly
what
they
said.
we
presume
it's
a
more
elaborate
demonstration.
no
evaluation
of
the
evidence.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
all
that
was
(inaudible)
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
counsel
presented
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
a
lot
of
documentation,
medical
reports
and
files
and
even
moving
pictures
as
i
understand
it,
which
had
relation
to
the
function
of
the
human
body
under
x-rays,
x-ray
moving
pictures.
these
were
never
examined,
never,
never
evaluated.
it
said
simply,
i
expect
this
was
just
a
more
elaborate
demonstration
of
the
same
arguments
that
were
made
27
years
earlier
when
the
case
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh,
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon,
please
permit
me
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
if
your
honor
will
look
at
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
state
court
decision,
which
i
believe
is
in
the
record,
you'll
find
that
they
said,
"we
apprehend
that
this
is
not
a
new
approach,
but
simply
a
more
elaborate
demonstration."
they
didn't
examine
the
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i'm
saying
that
they
didn't
look
at
it.
that's
what
our
position
is.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
--
well,
i'll
have
to
say
this,
mr.
justice
black.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
louisiana
counsel
on
coming
back
into
the
district
court
has
made
a
matter
of
record,
the
state
court
decision
and
opinion,
which
apparently
has
not
been
done.
however,
that
opinion
is
referred
to,
i
think,
in
the
brief
and
it's
reported
in
the
southern
reporter
where
the
louisiana
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
it
says
that
--
it's
claimed
by
the
plaintiffs
here
that
there
has
been
a
great
new
development
in
the
field
of
chiropractic
and
it
has
made
great
progress
and
so
on.
however
--
excuse
me
for
the
--
it
says,
"however,
we
apprehend
that
this
doesn't
show,"
this
evidence
doesn't
show
a
new
science
or
a
new
progress
but
it's
simply
more
elaborate
development
than
was
previously
before
us.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
they
--
they
simply
presume.
they
didn't
say,
"we
have
examined
the
evidence"
and
we
do
not
find
that
it
shows
such
and
such.
they
didn't
make
any
specific
finding.
they
said
we
presume,
mr.
justice.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
the
citation,
your
honor,
is
126
so.2d
page
51.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
apparently,
it
was
not
made
a
matter
of
record
in
the
united
states
district
court
when
they
came
back
after
abstention.
if
i
may
say
one
thing,
there
is
one
very
important
point.
in
connection
with
the
button
case,
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
may
be
particularly
interested
in
this
point.
there
were
two
parties
there.
there
was
harrison
and
there
was
the
defense
button.
one
of
them
came
up
here
on
certiorari.
button
came
up
here
on
certiorari.
the
other
(inaudible)
--
button,
of
course,
went
back
into
the
district
court
and
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
he
recognized
that
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
that
a
party
always
has
a
right
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
sir?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor,
you
did.
now,
on
that
basis,
obviously,
we
made
an
intelligent
judgment
as
well
as
we
couldn't
in
lack
of
guidance
from
this
court
of
an
authoritative
nature
at
that
time.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
no,
but
on
a
basis
of
the
information
available
to
us
at
the
time,
it
seemed
proper
to
go
into
the
district
court.
i
still
think
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
this
court
would
prefer
that
this
court
shouldn't
be
burdened
with
unnecessary
petitions
for
certiorari
in
appeals
if
the
district
court
can
dispose
them,
especially,
if
your
honors
please,
since
the
district
courts
will
undoubtedly
resolve
and
narrow
the
issues
that
must
be
brought
here.
why
this
court
have
its
docket
up
with
cases
that
have
just
been
decided
by
the
state
courts
probably
in
a
diffused
decision,
which
doesn't
specialized
by
federal
exposition
but
upon
the
state
law
and
the
facts
maybe
unsettled.
whereas,
if
you
go
on
to
the
federal
district
court,
proper
practice
of
law
would
enable
you
to
present
for
the
court's
decision,
requested
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
on
which
we
could
take
with
appeal.
now,
in
this
case
at
bar,
counsel
has
said
even
if
the
doctrine
of
abstention
means
nothing
or
it
means
that
the
state
court
decision
is
binding,
binding,
on
the
federal
courts,
well,
this
would
mean
an
abnegation
of
judicial
authority
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
it
in
the
thibodaux
case.
however,
we
don't
expect
anything
like
that
to
happen.
this
is
just
a
matter
of
clarifying
the
state
law
on
which
the
state
court
is
the
final
and
conclusive
authority.
in
the
leiter
case,
which
is
cited
in
a
case
cited
by
the
other
side,
leiter
minerals
against
united
states,
the
court
said,
“the
state
court
must
decide
these
questions
so
that
--
but
they
can
only
decide
questions
within
their
competence."
it's
a
case
of
rendering
(inaudible).
if
you
have
a
federal
question,
that
must
be
decided
in
the
federal
courts,
and
if
it's
a
state
law
question,
in
the
state
courts.
now,
we've
been
asked,
what's
our
prejudice?
we
have
never
been
afforded
a
decision
by
a
federal
forum
on
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
right
which
arises
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
civil
rights
act,
which
is
the
basis
on
which
this
action
is
brought.
we
feel
we're
entitled
to
that
decision
by
a
federal
court.
we
feel
too
that
to
say
that
the
decision
of
the
state
court
is
binding,
it's
simply
a
--
an
utter
abnegation
of
judicial
authority
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
thank
you,
your
honor.
