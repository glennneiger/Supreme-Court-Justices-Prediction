mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
you
certainly
do
and
i'm
glad
that
you
can.
i
think
my
opponent
here
today
has
adequately
stated
the
factual
situation
and
the
proposition
that
this
is
primarily
a
question
of
procedure
we
--
we
are
faced
with
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
as
these
proceedings
evolved
after
the
three-judge
court
had
abstained,
at
that
point,
if
we're
going
to
speak
about
these
various
elections,
that
--
or
selections
or
modes
of
procedure
that
the
plaintiffs
below
had
their
first
choice
to
make
at
that
time.
if
they
weren't
satisfied
with
that
abstention
order
under
the
rules
of
procedure
or
under
the
federal
statutory
procedural
devices,
they
had
a
right
of
direct
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1253
to
come
directly
to
this
court
and
challenge
that
abstention
order.
that
was
--
procedure
was
followed
in
a
recent
decision
of
this
court,
i
believe,
in
memphis
against
turner,
or
turner
against
the
city
of
memphis,
i
said
it
back.
at
that
point,
they
did
nothing
but
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
submit
the
same,
practically
the
same
petition,
asking
for
the
same
relief
in
the
state
courts
that
they
asked
for
in
the
federal
court.
the
only
difference
in
the
procedures
were
that
they
left
out
some
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
procedural
language
that
was
necessary
to
be
put
--
put
into
it.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
28
u.s.c.
1253.
i
have
it
right
here.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes.
well,
in
--
in
turner
against
the
city
of
memphis,
that's
a
--
it
was
a
case
where
the
court
had
abstain
and
they
--
and
they
appealed
to
this
court.
and
it
was
decided
in
1962.
the
supreme
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
informing
them
that
they
should
not
have
abstained
and
to
proceed
with
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
3
--
369
u.s.
350.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
--
yes,
there
was
an
appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
after
this
took
place
and
the
--
the
case
was
then
tried
in
the
state
courts
on
the
same
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
three-judge
court,
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
and
after
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
their
own.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
the
--
the
case
was
then
tried
and
submitted
in
the
state
district
court
on
its
--
on
the
same
evidence
that
had
been
presented
to
the
federal
district
court
and
had
been
removed
from
the
record
for
the
purpose
of
re-filing
it
in
the
state
district
court.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
state
court
of
appeals
and
writs
to
the
supreme
court
of
--
into
the
state
of
louisiana,
who
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
was
--
i'm
coming
to
that
too,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
exactly
the
same
thing
that
they
asked
for
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
--
in
the
original
federal
action
and
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
they
asked
for
an
injunction
and
they
asked
that
the
--
that
their
rights
be
declared
under
the
--
what
is
commonly
called
louisiana
medical
practice
act.
they
asked
for
the
injunction
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
--
and
that
the
act
be
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
at
that
point,
after
the
state
supreme
court
had
decided
the
case,
the
--
this
court
had
certainly
previously
decided
the
harrison
case
and
plaintiffs
were
or
should've
been
well
aware
of
the
jurisprudence
and
the
opinion
pronounced
in
that
case
because
it
was
cited
as
one
of
the
basis
for
the
abstention
by
the
federal
court.
at
that
time,
under
28
u.s.c.a.
1257
subsection
(2),
i
think
that
plaintiffs
had
a
right
of
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
the
state
court
had
upheld
the
validity
of
a
state
statute
under
the
federal
constitution
and
i
think
under
that
procedural
statute
that
that
gives
them
the
right
of
direct
appeal
to
this
court,
but
there
again,
the
--
they
did
nothing.
so
if
we
review
the
situation
now
--
at
--
at
that
point,
there
is
--
they
--
they
have
elected
or
selected
or
not
to
appeal
from
the
abstention
order.
they
have
elected
to
submit
all
of
their
issues
to
the
state
court
for
a
final
adjudication
and
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
in
the
light
of
that
decision,
they
still
could've
reserved
some
of
their
--
some
of
their
--
any
of
the
issues
that
they
wanted.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
what
was
said
in
windsor
was
that
when
the
doctrine
of
abstention
is
invoke,
all
the
state
issues
must
be
presented
to
the
state
court
in
the
context
of
the
federal
constitutional
objections
to
the
statute
so
that
the
state
court
may
--
may
reach
a
more
qualified
construction.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
well,
even
if
that
is
true
then
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you
follow
the
--
what
has
happened
since
in
the
harrison
and
the
button
cases,
in
the
--
in
the
harrison
case,
this
court
directed
the
--
the
federal
district
court
to
abstain
on
all
five
of
the
virginia
statutes
under
attack
when
they
had
in
fact
only
abstained
on
--
as
the
two
of
them,
but
then
when
the
--
for
some
reason,
when
the
plaintiffs
went
back
in
the
court,
they
only
raised
the
two
statutes.
they
didn't
raise
the
other
three.
so
they
still
exercise
an
election
and
then
still
and
all,
he
could
have
appealed
from
the
abstention
order.
if
--
if
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes.
well,
it
just
was
in
effect
what
was
done
because
the
evidence
had
all
been
presented,
the
matter
was
argued
and
submitted
to
the
court
and
then
the
court
did
not
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
case
but
then
simply
abstained.
in
other
words,
what
--
what
happens
in
these
cases
in
light
of
the
decisions
in
harrison
and
button,
which
i
think
now
the
--
the
result
of
the
evolution
of
the
doctrine
of
abstention
there
or
the
court's
--
or
button
at
least
as
the
court's
final
pronouncement
is
that
if
you
permit
such
a
procedure
as
to
exist
that
the
procedural
statutes
of
the
federal
courts
are
in
effect
going
to
be
limited,
overruled
or
--
or
--
and
--
and
put
out
of
existence
in
some
amount
or
shape
or
form
because
those
statutes
are
very
clearly
set
out,
i
believe.
the
appellate
procedures
which
are
available
under
these
circumstances
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
decision
in
the
button
case,
where
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
who
said
that
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
was
purely
formal
with
the
--
i
submit
the
understanding
that
in
the
event
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
courts
would
not
--
the
state
courts
would
not
properly
act
or
would
not
give
a
just
and
--
decision
that
--
that
then
that
--
that
the
federal
court
was
still
there
to
act
and
to
protect
the
--
the
rights
of
the
litigants.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
i
submit
he
did
so,
on
the
--
on
the
record
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
he
did.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
button
was
a
state
constructed
record.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
what
happened
was
that
in
harrison
against
naacp
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
--
the
naacp
attacked
five
virginia
statutes
then
the
--
the
federal
district
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
--
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
in
the
district
court
and
the
--
and
the
--
the
virginia
court,
the
district
court
decided
three
of
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional
and
abstained
and
sent
the
other
two
to
the
state
courts
and
that
was
appealed
to
the
--
to
this
court
and
this
court
then
ordered
the
federal
district
court
to
abstain
as
to
all
five
statutes,
but
for
some
reason,
only
two
were
--
were
litigated
in
the
virginia
courts
and
that
is
the
record
i
believe
that
came
back
up
here.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
whole
record
was
resubmitted
and
the
fact
was
stipulated
in
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes.
i'm
still
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
well,
when
i
say
it
was
the
same
record,
your
honor,
what
happened
was
that
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
withdrew.
all
of
this
was
done
--
all
of
the
record
was
made
in
both
courts
by
stipulation,
deposition
and
affidavits.
there
was
no
oral
testimony
taken
on
--
on
--
in
either
of
the
courts.
so
that
the
subject
matter,
the
evidence
was
merely
withdrawn
from
the
state
--
from
the
federal
record
re-filed
in
the
state
record
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
--
in
the
same
stipulations
under
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
--
with
the
decision
then
and
that
unless
the
defendants
had
appealed
the
case,
why,
it
would
have
ended
right
then
and
there.
i
think
i
would
begin
to
mention
that
what
in
effect,
i
believe,
that
counsel
here
is
asking
this
court
to
hold
in
this
case
is
to
permit
in
the
case
of
--
of
abstention,
the
federal
district
court
to
then
act
as
court
of
appeals
over
the
highest
court
of
the
various
states
because
that's
in
effect
what
they
would
do.
what
purpose
could
possibly
be
gained
now
to
re-litigate
this
case
all
over
again
in
the
federal
district
court
when
it's
already
been
re-litigated
and
--
and
these
people
had
every
right
in
the
world
to
appeal
to
this
court
and
to
have
all
of
their
federal
issues
passed
upon
by
this
court.
i
--
mr.
robert
e.
lecorgne,
jr.
right,
sir.
i
just
like
to
conclude,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
abstention
doctrine
is
based
upon
this
so-called
issue
of
comity
and
not
to
interfere
with
the
state
and
federal
relationship
and
not
to
interfere
with
the
state's
normal
--
normal
functions
and
--
and
operations.
and
that
has
always
been
or
has
been
for
years
of
philosophy,
i
think,
of
this
court.
and
--
and
in
--
in
this
abstention
doctrine,
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
it
would
always
assume
that
the
various
state
courts
would
do
their
duty
and
give
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
on
--
to
--
to
the
various
litigants
in
these
matters.
and
just
recently
in
one
of
your
decisions,
you
concluded
the
opinion
by
saying
up
in
martin
against
(inaudible)
that
in
the
event
that
the
litigant
--
the
plaintiffs
there
felt
that
they
--
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
i
believe,
was
involved,
would
deprive
them
of
every
--
any
of
their
property
without
due
process.
the
court
ended
its
opinion.
this
court
will
be
here.
and
i
think
that's
the
exact
proposition
that
we
have
here.
this
court
was
here
on
two
occasions
and
these
litigants
have
seen
fit
not
to
use
it
before
and
now
wish
us
to
begin
again
to
continue
this
long
process,
back
through
the
courts
again
and
again
and
again,
in
where
--
to
where
we
would
just
face
endless
litigation
on
it.
i
think
the
matter
can
be
resolved
once
and
for
all
by
this
court
at
this
time.
