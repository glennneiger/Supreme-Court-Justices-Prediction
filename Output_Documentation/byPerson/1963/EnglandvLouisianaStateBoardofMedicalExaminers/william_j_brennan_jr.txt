(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
--
you
did
raise
the
federal
question
in
your
state
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
reason
why
he
made
that
choice?
perhaps
you've
mentioned
it,
i
haven't
heard
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
federal
constitutional
questions
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
you
had
to
or
not,
at
least
i
take
it
windsor
would
lead
--
that
careful
counsel
i
think
would
be
better,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
another
party
in
button,
you
may
recall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
did
go
back
to
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
wrote
the
words.
i
don't
think
i
said
it
quite
that
way
but
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
(inaudible)
suggest
that
was
i
meant
--
i
presume.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
its
own.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
was
point
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
(inaudible)
was
preceded
though,
was
it
not
by
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where,
however,
the
party
remitted
to
the
state
court
in
this
instance
as
the
appellants
here,
this
party
elects
to
seek
a
complete
and
final
adjudication
of
his
rights
in
the
state
court,
may
that
be
said
of
what
this
appellant
did
in
the
louisiana
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
remember
in
button,
you
see,
not
only
was
the
submission
on
the
federal
court
record
but
indeed
there
was
additional
testimony
taken
before
the
richmond
corporation
i
think
it
was
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
it
was
--
as
i
recall
it
now,
i
may
be
wrong
about
this
but
i
think
there
was
a
federal
court
record
which
was
then
expanded
in
the
state
court
proceeding
as
i
recall
it.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.

(voice

justice

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
the
district
court
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
page
418,
the
opinion
in
button
does
say,
the
complainants
thereupon
petitioned
the
circuit
court
to
declared
chapters
33
and
36
inapplicable
to
that
activity,
the
record
in
the
circuit
court
was
that
made
before
the
three-judge
court
supplemented
by
additional
evidence.
that
was
my
recollection
of
what
happened.
in
other
--
as
i
understand
it,
what
happened
here
was,
what
went
through
the
state
courts
was
only
the
record
that's
made
before
the
district
court.
is
that
right,
in
this
--
in
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
in
addition
to
the
record
made
before
the
federal
three-judge
court,
was
there
in
a
way
of
a
record
before
the
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
same
evidence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
before
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
there
is,
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
a
difference
and
it's
not
necessarily
but
certainly,
in
button,
in
addition
to
submitting
the
federal
court
record,
the
party
took
more
testimony
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
decision's
been
the
other
way,
that
would
have
ended
the
case,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
the
--
and
the
record,
the
cold
record
as
it
is
in
the
decision
below
was
made
on
a
--
on
a
paper
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
brown,
are
there
any
other
--
are
there
any
issues
which
you
now
have
litigated
before
the
three-judge
court
that
were
not
litigated
in
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
federal
issues,
i
should
put
it,
which
you
want
to
take
back
to
the
state
court
which
were
not
--
the
term
submitted
to
and
determined
by
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
mean
that
--
that's
not
in
this
transcript
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
didn't
have
button
when
you
made
that
decision.
