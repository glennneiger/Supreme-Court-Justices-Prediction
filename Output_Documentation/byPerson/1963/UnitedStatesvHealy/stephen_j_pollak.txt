mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
dismissal
by
the
district
court
of
an
indictment
in
two
counts.
the
unlawful
acts
alleged
in
the
counts
consisted
of
the
forcing
by
the
defendants
at
gunpoint
of
the
pilot
of
an
airborne
aircraft
to
transport
them
from
the
air
above
dade
county,
florida
to
the
republic
of
cuba.
count
1
of
the
indictment
alleged
that
these
acts
were
in
violation
of
the
federal
kidnapping
statute,
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
transport
a
person
unlawfully
seized
and
held
for
ransom,
reward
or
otherwise.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
date
of
the
alleged
act
was
april
13,
1962.
the
court
read
the
statutory
words,
ransom
or
reward
or
otherwise,
to
require
a
wrongful
goal
of
a
pecuniary
or
monetary
sort
and
held
that
transportation
to
cuba
was
not
such
a
goal
and
dismissed
the
count.
the
issue
presented
whether
the
words
for
ransom
or
reward
or
otherwise,
limit
the
kidnapping
statute
to
a
holding
for
a
monetary
minimum.
count
2
alleged
that
these
acts
constituted
a
violation
of
the
air
piracy
statute.
this
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
seize
by
force
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce.
the
district
court
held
that
the
cessna
airplane
that
the
defendants
were
alleged
to
have
seized
was
not
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce.
it
read
those
words
to
mean
only
a
commercial
airliner
which
carries
passengers
or
goods
for
hire.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
these
words,
"an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce"
limit
the
statute
to
commercial
airliners,
the
seizure
of
commercial
airlines.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
to
the
dismissal
issue
raised
by
the
dismissal
of
count
1,
the
kidnapping
count.
and
then
to
turn
briefly
to
the
air
piracy
count.
in
1932,
the
congress
passed
the
federal
kidnapping
statute,
it
was
known
as
the
lindbergh
law
and
it
made
it
a
crime
to
transport
in
interstate
commerce
a
person
who
had
been
unlawfully
seized
and
was
held
for
ransom
or
reward.
two
years
later,
the
congress
amended
the
statute
to
add
the
words,
"making
it
a
crime
to
transport
a
person
unlawfully
seized
and
held
for
ransom
or
reward
or
otherwise,
except
in
the
case
of
a
minor
by
a
parent,"
made
an
exception
for
the
seizure
or
kidnapping
of
a
child
by
his
parents.
the
purpose
of
these
amendments,
as
stated
in
the
courts
of
the
committees,
the
senate
and
the
house,
was
to
extend
the
kidnapping
statute
to
persons
held
not
only
for
reward
but
for
any
other
purpose.
one
year
later,
this
court
in
the
case
of
gooch
versus
the
united
states,
had
occasioned
to
study
the
statute
and
interpret
the
statute.
the
court
there
faced
the
very
issue
on
which
the
district
court
here
dismissed
the
kidnapping
count,
that
is
whether
the
words
for
ransom
or
reward
or
otherwise
reached
beyond
a
pecuniary
purpose.
the
acts
there
alleged
in
the
gooch
case
was
the
holding
of
a
--
of
an
officer
for
the
purpose
of
the
defendants
avoiding
or
the
accused
avoiding
arrest,
holding
of
an
officer
to
avoid
arrest.
the
court
reviewed
the
legislative
history.
in
fact,
substantial
body
of
the
history
is
printed
in
the
footnote
of
the
court
in
that
opinion
and
it
held
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
reach
and
did
reach
a
holding
for
any
purpose
to
secure
a
benefit
to
the
person
who
did
the
seizing.
it
held
that
the
statute
was
not
restricted
to
a
holding
for
a
pecuniary
purpose.
we
believe
that
this
decision
in
gooch
establishes
the
error
of
the
district
court,
the
statute
reaches
a
holding
for
any
other
purpose
as
the
congress
stated
and
that
transportation
to
cuba
here
involved
is
such
a
purpose.
indeed,
the
appellees
concede
that
the
statute
reaches
beyond
the
holding
for
a
pecuniary
purpose.
at
page
9
of
their
brief
and
thereby
relinquished
or
moved
away
from
the
ground
on
which
the
district
court
rested
its
dismissal.
and
they
argue
that
the
statute
reaches
only
an
unlawful
seizure,
an
unlawful
holding
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
the
contention
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
holding
must
be
due
itself
unlawful,
that
is
for
a
purpose
of
committing
a
robbery
or
rape
or
escaping
arrest
and
that
mere
one
way
ticket
to
cuba
is
not
an
unlawful
act,
not
an
unlawful
purpose.
in
our
view,
the
court's
decision
in
gooch
also
answers
this
contention
because
at
the
end
of
that
opinion,
the
court
there
recognized
that
the
congress
had
made
an
exception
for
the
kidnapping
by
a
parent
of
his
child
and
the
court
said
that
a
parent
who
carried
his
child
away
because
of
the
--
because
of
affection
might
subject
himself
to
the
condemnation
of
the
statute
but
for
this
exception.
and
in
our
view,
this
is
a
recognition
that
an
act
which
in
itself
that
is
the
gratification
of
love
of
a
parent
for
the
child,
an
act
not
unlawful
would
be
reached
by
the
statute
but
for
this
--
this
exception.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
as
you've
stated
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
indictment
in
the
record
doesn't
indicate
at
all.
just
this
morning,
i
endeavored
to
find
and
see
if
i
could
find
anything
further
and
it's
not
it
--
again,
i
don't
like
to
go
beyond
the
record
but
i
believe
they
rented
this
small
plane.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
was
a
four-passenger
cessna
flown
out
again
not
--
the
four-passenger
is
in
the
indictment,
cessna
is
in
the
indictment.
not
in
the
indictments
effect,
i
believe
it
was
rendered
or
flown
out
at
tamiami
airport
down
into
florida.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
was
--
it
was
in
flight
as
is
stated
in
the
indictment
and
the
indictment
indicates
that
they
pulled
a
gun
and
forced
the
pilot
to
fly
the
plane
to
cuba.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
there
--
no,
no.
there's
no
indication,
that
fact
is
they
have
the
--
they
have
different
names,
the
pilot's
names
was
woodruff
mead
(ph)
and
the
indictment
alleged
that
he
was
released
unharmed
upon
the
termination
of
the
flight.
in
our
view
of
the
argument
that
the
purpose
must
be
unlawful
is
--
it's
said
difficult
to
take
seriously.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history,
there's
no
indication
that
any
of
the
cases.
indeed
the
cases
have
--
court
of
appeals
cases
upheld
where
the
purpose
was
a
seizure
to
gain
a
ride
somewhere.
indeed,
there's
a
case,
the
hess
case
where
one
of
the
kidnappers
secured
a
ride
from
--
the
person's
name
is
holding
out
in
the
country
down
to
macy's
in
downtown
kansas
city
and
this
was
upheld
as
constituting
a
kidnapping.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
the
record
doesn't
indicate
even
that
it
was
a
rental.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
record
only
indicates
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
that
they
were
in
flight.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
and
i
--
i
really
don't
believe
--
believe
i
know
if
i
were
to
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
the,
yes?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
my
understanding
that
it
was
not
to
go
to
cuba
and
i
am
clear
in
that,
yes
sir.
the
--
if
the
purpose
of
the
holding
had
to
be
an
unlawful
purpose
and
we
find
nothing
in
cases,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
if
indeed
it
did,
certainly,
the
argument
can
be
made
that
the
condition
is
met
here
because
at
the
time
of
these
acts,
it
was
unlawful
under
declaration
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
travel
to
cuba
without
especially
validated
passports
or
prior
passports
had
been
revoked
in
1961
and
required
special
validation
and
it's
unlikely
that
these
gentlemen
went
through
any
of
the
necessary
procedures
to
proceed
to
cuba.
the
statutes
of
united
states
may
travel
without
such
a
passport
of
crime.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
my
understanding
is
that
the
release
of
the
person
seized
unharmed
makes
the
penalty
inflict
that
penalty.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
oh,
the
--
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
pilot
was
released
unharmed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
then
he
--
then
returned
to
the
united
states
as
did
the
--
the
defendants.
we
believe
that
there
is
even
--
turning
to
the
second
count,
the
air
piracy
count,
that
there's
even
less
basis
for
the
court's
action
and
if
possible
less
basis
for
the
court's
action
in
dismissing
this
count.
the
air
piracy
statute
was
passed
ion
1961
as
an
amendment
to
the
federal
aviation
act.
it
was
passed
with
several
provisions
as
an
answer
to
the
then
going
rush
of
hijackings.
the
statute
on
air
piracy,
one
of
the
several
statutes
passed
is
a
simple
provision
that
makes
it
unlawful
to
seize
an
aircraft,
to
seize
by
force,
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce.
the
terms
"chosen"
and
"aircraft"
and
"air
commerce"
were
words
of
art.
they
had
been
defined
in
the
federal
aviation
act
which
was
passed
in
1958
and
indeed,
they
had
been
defined
in
essentially
the
same
terms
in
the
civil
aeronautics
act
passed
in
1938.
the
court
--
and
they
had
interpreted
in
prior
cases
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
the
district
courts.
the
district
court's
holding
here
that
the
cessna
was
not
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce,
it
was
in
(inaudible)
disregard
of
these
definitions
and
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
air
piracy
statute.
the
definition
in
the
statute
of
an
aircraft
is
a
broad
one.
any
contrivance
known
or
hereafter
invented
used
or
designed
for
navigation
or
flight
in
the
air.
there
really
can
be
no
contention
that
this
wasn't
an
aircraft
that
was
in
flight
in
the
air
and
i
don't
suppose
that
anybody
would
contend
otherwise.
air
commerce
also
defined
in
the
statute
as
any
operation
or
navigation
of
aircraft
within
the
limits
of
any
federal
airway
or
any
operation
or
navigation
of
aircraft
which
directly
affects
or
which
may
affect
or
may
endanger
safety
in
interstate,
foreign
or
overseas
commerce.
the
indictment,
count
2
charge
that
the
plane
at
the
time
it
was
seized
was
in
a
federal
airway.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
federal
airway?
these
are
designated
passageways
at
different
heights
and
directions
in
the
regulations
established
by
the
federal
aviation
administration.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
these
--
these
statutory
definitions
long
ago
were
interpreted
if
in
--
i
might
cite
for
the
court
two
early
cases
which
interpreted
the
definitions
rosenhan
versus
the
united
states
131
f.2d
and
the
united
states
versus
drumm,
55
f.supp.
these
cases
had
occasioned
to
interpret
the
definitions
back
at
the
time
the
civil
aeronautics
administration
was
testing
its
wings,
i
suppose,
its
regulatory
wings
to
require
certificates
of
air
worthiness
for
planes,
licenses
for
pilots
and
arguments
were
made
that
these
planes
were
--
in
the
drumm
case,
i
believe
the
pilot
said
that,
"i
only
fly
over
my
own
corn
field
and
i
don't
go
near
any
other
planes
and
therefore,
i
need
neither
a
certificate
of
air
worthiness
for
my
plane
or
a
license
for
myself."
and
the
court
in
both
those
cases
essentially,
held
that
any
flight
over
the
air
space
of
the
united
states
was
a
flight
which
may
affect
safety
in
--
in
commerce
and
a
flight
for
which
the
pilot
needed
a
license
and
which
the
aircraft
needed
a
certificate.
the
--
if
the
definitions
as
read
by
the
district
court
below
in
this
case
were
so
limited
--
limited
to
commercial
airlines,
these
early
cases
would
be
wrongly
decided,
the
scope
of
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
civil
aeronautics
administrations
for
all
those
years
and
this
federal
aviation
agency
would
really
extend
only
to
commercial
airliners
because
it
is
the
same
definitions
which
provide
the
base
for
that
regulatory
action.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
those
early
cases
are
not
in
the
brief
and
that
is
the
reason
i
--
i
cited
them
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
rosenhan
versus
the
united
states,
131
f.2nd
and
the
united
states
versus
drumm,
55
f.supp.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
ruling
however
does
not
--
not
only
flouts
these
definitions
in
these
early
and
constant
interpretations
of
the
definitions
but
the
legislative
history
here
is
--
is
overwhelming.
on
this
amendment
to
the
federal
aviation
act
in
1961,
the
air
piracy
provision
was
proposed
by
senator
ingle
and
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
at
the
time
the
bill
was
under
discussion
not
once
but
twice,
he
was
asked
as
he
explained
the
bill
whether
it
reached
commercial
airliners
and
private
planes,
and
he
said
not
once
but
twice
that
it
did.
in
the
hearings
in
the
senate,
a
witness
from
the
business
aircraft
association
specifically
testified
twice
that
the
statute
reached
the
airliners
and
private
planes.
the
house
committee
report
made
the
same
statement
at
the
outset
of
the
report
and
in
the
body
of
the
report.
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
in
the
house
which
held
the
hearings
on
the
bill,
john
bell
williams
in
the
debate
on
the
floor,
this
was
not
an
item
of
the
debate
but
in
the
discussion
of
the
bill,
made
a
specific
point
that
had
reached
commercial
airliners
private
and
business
planes.
representative
oren
harris,
the
chairman
of
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee
reported
the
bill
and
as
i
understand
that
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill
also
said
that
it
reached
private
planes
as
well
as
commercial
airliners.
i
can
find
no
contrary
evidence
that
the
air
piracy
provision
was
intended
to
be
or
is
limited
to
commercial
airliners.
and
there
--
i
can
find
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
construction.
it
loses
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
bill
which
is
to
protect
the
planes
from
seizure
and
the
safety
of
the
passengers
not
only
in
planes,
persons
in
the
planes
but
also
the
other
flights
that
are
in
the
airspace.

court

mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
just
have
two
very
brief
points.
in
reliance
on
the
chatwin
case,
the
government
would
emphasize
the
point
that
has
been
made
by
mr.
justices
stewart
and
goldberg
that
--
that
that
case
rested
on
the
fact
that
there
was
--
the
court
felt
no
evidence
of
an
unwillingness
of
a
none
--
of
the
young
girl
to
go
with
the
--
the
68-year-old
man.
indeed,
the
--
in
the
portion
quoted
in
the
appellee's
brief,
there
are
some
material
that's
omitted
and
it
reads
this
adding
the
material
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
9
and
page
464
of
the
supreme
court
report

the
broadness
of
the
statutory
language
does
not
permit
us
to
tear
the
words
out
of
their
context
using
the
magic
of
(inaudible)
to
apply
them
to
unattractive
or
immoral
situations

i'm
back
at
the
quote,
"the
very
essence
of
the
crime
of
kidnapping."
in
our
view,
the
chatwin
case
is
fully
explainable
by
the
fact
that
there
was
not
there
the
involuntariness
of
seizure
and
detention
which
is
the
essence
of
kidnapping
and
which
is
here,
and
we
--
we
think
that
is
the
significance
of
that
case.
and
indeed,
we
do
not
feel
that
our
case
in
any
way
rests
on
the
unlawfulness
or
lawfulness
of
a
flight
to
cuba
because
we
--
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
basis
for
the
argument
that
the
purpose
must
be
an
unlawful
one.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
brennan
i
don't
think
any
point
was
made
up
and
no
argument
was
made
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
--
that
is
correct.
the
26
federal
register
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
the
department
of
state
public
notice
179.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
--
we
--
i
believe
that
is
--
we
--
we
only
felt
obliged
--
i
felt
obliged
since
the
argument
was
made
that
the
purpose
need
to
be
unlawful
and
--
and
since
the
appellees
no
longer
contended
the
ground
on
which
the
district
judge
had
dismissed
it.
i
felt
obliged
to
make
some
response
to
that
and
that's
the
reason
i
looked
into
the
legality
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
absolutely,
absolutely.
let's
take
it,
a
flight
from
dade
county,
florida
over
to
georgia.
we
would
--
we
do
not
want
it
all
to
be
understood
as
resting
on
the
fact
that
flights
to
cuba
were
lawful,
unlawful
or
in
any
other
sense,
any
flight
under
seizure.
the
contentions
of
the
government
in
response
to
the
argument
on
the
timeliness
of
its
notice
of
appeal
are
in
the
reply
briefs
both
on
--
to
the
most,
be
dismissed
on
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
the
brief
on
the
merits.
