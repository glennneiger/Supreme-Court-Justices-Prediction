justice

i
realized
what
we
have
before
us
that
really
is
--
is
--
in
this
indictment,
we
don't
have
any
evidence
or
thing
but
you
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
how
these
people
get
into
the
private
airplane,
were
they
sent
to
the
pilot
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
and
held
them
up
while
he's
in
the
air
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
indication
that
the
pilot
was
there,
they
were
parents
of
the
family?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
that
as
i
suppose
to
the
term
of
art,
what's
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
these
days,
every
plane
that
takes
off,
of
every
type
has
to
get
that
kind
of
a
clearance
isn't
it,
and
that
the
--
and
there
--
and
therefore
it's
within
a
--
the
limits
of
a
federal
airway?
justice
potter
stewart
neither
the
citation
again.
justice
potter
stewart
f.supp.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
in
recollecting
that
the
interstate
theft
of
an
airplane
is
covered
by
the
direct
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
amendment
of
the
direct?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
difference
in
the
chatwin
case
though
is
(inaudible)
and
i
read
it,
is
that
there,
the
court
found
that
that
either
that
chatwin
or
the
other
codefendants
ever
imposed
any
unlawful
physical
and
mental
restraints
upon
the
movements
of
the
victim,
the
other
--
the
younger
girl
who
is
the
party
to
the
celestial
marriage.
and
here,
all
we
have
is
the
indictment
but
the
indictment
certainly
alleges
that
the
pilot
was
placed
under
restraining
coercion.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
