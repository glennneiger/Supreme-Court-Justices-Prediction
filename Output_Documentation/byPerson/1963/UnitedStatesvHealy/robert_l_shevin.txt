mr.
robert
l.
shevin
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
robert
l.
shevin,
from
the
law
firm
of
shevin,
goodman
&
holtzman,
miami,
florida.
we
represent
the
defendant
david
thomas
healy.
our
first
contention
is
that
the
appellant's
notice
of
appeal
was
not
filed
within
the
time
allowed
and
that
on
this
basis,
this
court
should
dismiss
this
appeal
even
though
in
--
an
order
entered
at
372
u.s.
963,
probable
jurisdiction
has
been
previously
noted.
now,
the
only
properly
appealable
order
that
is
before
this
court,
is
the
order
granting
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
both
counts
of
the
indictment.
this
order
was
entered
by
the
honorable
emett
choate,
united
states
district
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
florida
on
september
17th,
1962.
now,
this
is
the
only
appealable
order
notwithstanding
the
reference
made
by
the
government
in
the
notice
of
appeal
which
purports
in
addition
to
this
order
to
also
appeal
from
an
order
dated
november
5,
1962
denying
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing.
surely,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
the
order
denying
the
petition
for
rehearing
is
not
itself
an
appealable
order.
this
appeal,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
is
only
permitted
by
virtue
of
18
u.s.
code
3731
providing
for
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
the
district
court
directly
to
the
supreme
court
on
a
judgment
or
decision
dismissing
an
indictment
where
it's
based
on
the
invalidity
or
construction
of
a
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
founded.
an
appeal
from
an
order
denying
a
petition
for
rehearing
would
surely
be
outside
of
the
scope
of
18
u.s.
code
3731.
"rule
11.2
of
the
supreme
court
rules
provides
that
in
these
cases
allowing
for
a
direct
appeal,
the
notice
of
appeal
shall
be
filed
by
the
government
within
30
days
after
the
entry
of
the
order
appealed
from.
in
the
instant
case,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
not
filed
until
december
5,
1962,
some
79
days
after
the
entry
of
the
order
appealed
from
which
is
the
order
of
dismissal
of
september
17th,
1962."
the
government's
appeal
was,
therefore,
not
filed
properly
within
the
30-day
period
after
the
entry
of
the
order.
it
is
untimely
and
it
should
be
dismissed
on
this
basis.
the
time
for
appeal
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
i
will
not
refute
that
and
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
government's
brief
and
they
have
answered
us
on
the
reply
brief
even
though
they
didn't
argue
it
orally.
they
cite
only
civil
cases
to
support
their
position
that
they
have
a
right
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
but
there
is
no
statute,
there
is
no
rule,
there
is
no
precedent
by
case
law
or
otherwise
that
entitles
the
government
to
file
a
so-called
petition
for
rehearing
which
in
effect
would
therefore
according
to
their
position
stay,
extend,
or
told
the
time
for
appeal.
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
--
in
this
particular
situation
where
the
right
of
appeal
is
limited
by
statute,
that
the
rule
provides
a
30-day
period
after
the
entry
of
the
order
appealed
from
and
the
all
that
the
government
did
within
that
30-day
period
was
to
file
a
so-called
petition
for
rehearing
which
is
not
authorized
by
statute,
by
rule
or
by
previous
case
law.
and
then
we
contend
of
course
that
even
if
such
a
petition
for
rehearing
would
be
authorized
that
it
most
surely
does
not
extend
at
all
or
in
anyway
stay
the
time
for
appeal
from
running.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
your
honor,
let
us
refer
if
i
may
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
we
have
rule
37
(a).2
which
sets
forth
that
a
defendant
is
given
10
days
to
file
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
that
after
this
10-day
period
runs,
after
the
entry
of
the
order
denying
the
motion,
he
still
has
an
additional
10-day
period
within
which
to
appeal.
then
the
second
provision
of
this
rule
says,
however,
the
government
is
given
30
days
when
they
can
appeal
and
it
does
not
provide
for
a
similar
situation
allowing
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
to
extend
the
time
by
filing
a
petition.
now,
the
point
is
that
in
this
rule,
a
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
we
have
a
right
given
to
a
defendant
which
is
not
a
corollary
right
given
to
the
government.
now,
the
only
cases
relied
on
by
the
government
in
this
instance
is
that
where
civil
cases
specifically
by
rule
provide
for
petition
for
rehearings,
they
can
file
them.
but
there
certainly
has
no
provision
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
instant
case
and
therefore,
if
it
were
filed,
it
surely
should
not
stay
the
time
for
appeal.
now,
this
court,
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
robinson,
361
u.s.,
220,
has
previously
held
that
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
as
to
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
after
the
expiration
of
time
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
the
district
court
found
in
that
case
that
the
light
--
late
filing
was
excusable
neglect.
the
court
points
out
that
to
recognize
a
late
notice
of
appeal
is
actually
to
enlarge
the
period
of
taking
an
appeal
which
is
forfeit
or
otherwise
as
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
many
appeals
might
and
almost
surely
would
be
indefinitely
delayed.
and
the
court
points
out
that
to
avoid
this,
the
question
of
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
is
jurisdictional
and
there
is
no
basis
for
allowing
a
petition
for
rehearing.
now,
the
government
does
cite
one
case
in
their
reply
brief
which
is
a
criminal
case,
that
is
craig
versus
the
united
states
reported
at
298
u.s.
637,
wherein
the
defendant
had
filed
--
had
a
petition
for
rehearing
pending
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
while
this
petition
for
rehearing
was
pending,
he
had
simultaneously
applied
to
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari.
this
court
found
that
the
petition
was
premature
because
the
petition
for
rehearing
had
not
yet
been
disposed
off
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
most
assuredly,
this
situation
which
is
governed
by
rule
allowing
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
an
appellate
decision
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
extended
to
give
any
authority
for
the
type
of
petition
filed
here
which
is
a
so-called
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
order
denying
the
indictment
or
the
order
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
sir.
i
have
not.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
alright,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
it
is
our
position
that
the
rules
and
statutes
governing
this
appeal
are
quite
clear
in
their
scope
that
to
have
properly
appealed,
the
government
should
have
filed
their
appeal
within
30
days
after
the
entry
that
the
order
appealed
from.
in
this
instance,
it
was
79
days
after
the
entry
of
the
order.
it
was,
therefore,
untimely
and
this
court
should
dismiss
the
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
have
the
first
issue
of
whether
the
federal
kidnapping
act
is
applicable
to
situations
where
there
is
an
unlawful
transportation
for
a
lawful
purpose.
now,
the
kidnapping
act,
18
u.s.c.
1201,
specifically
provides
and
defines
kidnapping
as
knowingly
transporting
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
any
person
who
has
been
unlawfully
seized
or
carried
away
and
held
for
ransom,
reward
or
otherwise.
in
count
1
of
the
indictment,
the
defendants
were
charged
with
an
alleged
violation
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
18
u.s.c.
1201,
by
allegedly
forcing
one
woodruff
mead
(ph)
at
gunpoint
and
against
his
will
to
fly
an
aircraft
that
he
was
then
piloting
to
with
a
four
passengers,
cessna
172
to
the
republic
of
cuba
which
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
--
and
here
is
the
important
provision,
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
the
defendants
from
dade
county,
florida
to
cuba.
now,
regardless
of
what
counsel
states
as
far
as
the
immigration
requirements
of
the
state
department,
surely
there
is
not
in
this
indictment
any
indication
of
any
law
being
broken
by
flying
from
dade
county,
florida
to
the
republic
of
cuba.
the
federal
judge
dismissed
this
count
of
the
indictment
in
his
order
of
september
17th,
1962
based
on
the
courts'
construction
of
the
statute,
in
that
he
concluded
that
the
facts
as
alleged
do
not
state
an
offense
under
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
that
there's
a
failure
to
allege
that
mead
(ph)
was
kidnapped
for
a
purpose
within
the
meaning
of
ransom,
reward
or
otherwise.
now,
the
government
has
relied
heavily
on
legislative
history
in
the
case
of
gooch
versus
the
united
states,
297
u.s.
124.
they
cite
legislative
history
on
page
10
of
their
brief
and
they
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
to
extend
the
act
for
any
purpose
--
for
any
purpose.
they
even
emphasized
this
statement
in
their
brief
and
they
emphasized
the
statement
in
their
oral
argument
for
any
reason
or
for
any
purpose.
now,
the
early
gooch
case
seems
to
bear
this
out.
it
seems
to
indicate
that
this
court
will
likewise
apply
this
kidnapping
act
for
any
purpose.
and
yet,
what
do
we
have
after
the
gooch
case?
we
have
the
case
of
chatwin
versus
the
united
states,
326
u.s.
455,
wherein
it
was
recognized
in
that
case
that
in
the
extension
or
interpretation
as
the
government
would
have
us
extend
in
the
federal
kidnapping
act
was
unworthy.
we
have
in
the
chatwin
case
a
tempering,
a
more
moderate
approach
notwithstanding
legislative
intent
or
history
as
emphasized
by
the
government
and
notwithstanding
the
ruling
in
the
earlier
gooch
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
celestial
marriage
of
a
mormon
and
a
15-year-old
girl
without
her
parent's
consent
in
chatwin
versus
the
united
states,
326
u.s.
455
which
is
quoted
extensively
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
is
no
less
a
benefit
to
that
defendant
as
was
the
transportation
from
florida
to
cuba
to
the
defendants
who
were
charged
with
violation
of
the
kidnapping
act
in
the
instant
case.
in
the
gooch
case,
the
alleged
transportation
of
police
officers
was
to
prevent
the
arrest
of
their
captives
clearly
an
illegal
purpose.in
the
instant
case,
there
is
nothing
illegal
alleged
in
being
transported
from
florida
to
cuba
as
the
district
court
properly
found
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act.
all
of
the
authority
relied
on
by
the
government
involves
unlawful
transportation
for
the
accomplishment
of
an
unlawful
purpose.
the
federal
kidnapping
act
with
its
severe
penalties
should
not
apply
where
the
indictment
alleges
unlawful
transportation
for
a
lawful
purpose.
that
is
transportation
from
florida
to
cuba.
perhaps
under
these
facts,
there
could
be
proper
offenses
alleged
such
as
lesser
state
offenses
or
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment
but
most
assuredly,
this
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act,
18
u.s.
code
1201
and
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
we're
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
we're
not
defending
the
unlawful
transportation.
what
we're
saying
is
that
under
the
kidnapping
act,
there
are
three
things
that
must
be
alleged
and
proven.
one
is
an
unlawful
seizure,
the
second
is
the
transportation
in
interstate
commerce,
unlawfully
and
the
third
is
for
a
specific
purpose.
now,
what
we
contend
is
that
in
all
the
authority
that
has
previously
been
before
this
court
and
other
courts.
true,
there
may
have
been
properly
alleged
an
unlawful
seizure
and
true,
there
may
have
been
properly
alleged
a
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
but
the
purpose
of
the
transportation
as
alleged
in
the
indictment
which
was
the
basis
of
the
court's
dismissal
is
to
transport
these
people
from
--
from
florida
to
cuba.
now,
the
government
has
contended
as
they
contended
in
the
lower
court
that
this
falls
within
the
meaning
of
ransom,
reward
or
otherwise.
we
contend
that
this
case
--
court
since
the
gooch
case
has
recognized
that
not
every
unlawful
transportation
falls
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
"otherwise"
and
that
if
this
were
so
as
this
court
has
held
and
has
stated
in
chatwin
versus
the
united
states
on
page
466.
this
court
stated
where
we
--
this
sanction
a
careless
concept
of
a
crime
of
kidnapping
or
are
we
to
disregard
the
background
and
setting
of
this
act,
the
boundaries
of
potential
liability
would
be
lost
in
infinity.
a
loose
construction
of
the
statutory
language
conceivably
could
lead
to
the
punishment
of
anyone
who
induced
another
to
leave
his
surroundings
so
as
to
do
either
an
innocent
or
an
illegal
act
for
the
benefit
of
the
former
state
line
subsequently
being
transcribed.
the
absurdity
of
such
a
result
with
its
attendant
likelihood
of
unfair
punishment
and
blackmail
is
sufficient
by
itself
to
foreclose
this
construction.
now,
what
we
urge
this
court
to
do
is
reject
the
position
of
the
united
states
which
we
contend
if
upheld
would
sanction
a
careless
concept
of
this
very
serious
crime
of
kidnapping.
now,
in
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
this
is
a
position
taken
by
the
government,
we
contend
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
my
position
is
that
the
actual
purpose
of
transportation
from
florida
to
cuba
is
not
in
and
off
itself
unlawful
so
as
to
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
perhaps
they
have
been
guilty
of
the
crime
of
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment
by
state
law
but
we're
now
dealing
with
the
federal
kidnapping
act
and
as
such,
it
is
our
position
that
this
act
requires
an
unlawful
purpose
such
as
in
the
gooch
case
to
prevent
their
capture.
this
is
why
they
kidnapped
the
police
officers
to
prevent
their
capture.
in
all
of
the
cases
involving
the
definition
of
otherwise,
it
has
been
for
an
illegal
purpose
to
commit
a
robbery
as
indicated
by
counsel
to
commit
a
rape,
to
prevent
capture.
we're
here
dealing
with
allegedly
a
seizure
of
an
individual
against
his
will
but
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
them
from
one
place
to
another,
and
we
contend
that
the
transportation
from
one
place
to
another
is
not
itself
an
unlawful
purpose
and
this
is
the
basis
of
the
distinction
that
we're
trying
to
draw
in
the
senses
as
indicated
by
this
court
in
the
earlier
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
congress
obviously
attempted
to
extend
the
doctrine
to
purposes
other
than
pecuniary
value,
other
than
reward
or
ransom,
but
we
still
contend
that
congress
did
not
mean
another
warrant
to
the
approach
that
would
allow
this
federal
kidnapping
act
to
apply
to
any
asportation
or
seizure
of
an
individual
regardless
of
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
we
feel
that
the
case
that
we
cited
referred
to
before
this,
the
united
states
supreme
court
case
of
chatwin
versus
the
united
states,
appears
to
limit
the
thinking
of
the
gooch
case
and
of
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir,
the
statute
--
this
is
a
newer
case
after
the
gooch
case,
and
the
statute
did
read
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
my
--
my
point
in
--
in
referring
to
the
chatwin
case
is
that
it
is
indicative
of
what
this
court
has
said
previously
that
it
will
not
allow
an
unwarranted
or
loose
construction.
now,
we're
dealing
with
the
facts
in
this
indictment.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
we
contend
that
to
apply
this
act
so
this
indictment
would
allow
such
a
construction.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
was
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
the
--
the
--
of
course
the
case
came
up
on
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
kidnapping
act.
this
was
the
basis
of
the
charge
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
court's
opinion,
a
construction
of
that
act.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
your
honor,
i'm
reading
the
--
the
basis
of
the
act
under
which
these
people
are
charged
specifically
requires
a
showing
that
it
be
for
ransom,
reward
or
otherwise
and
the
indictment
must
so
allege
and
it
did
allege
that
the
otherwise
in
this
case
was
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
them
from
florida
to
cuba.
and
we
contend
that
this
is
not
--
that
this
court
should
not
extend
the
doctrine
of
otherwise
to
apply
to
a
situation
involving
ostensibly
a
legal
transportation
from
one
place
to
another.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
there
must
be
some
--
there
must
be
some
purpose
because
the
code
provision
requires
that
a
purpose
be
stated.
this
is
one
of
the
material
allegations
of
alleging
the
crime
of
kidnapping.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
that
that
was
the
legislative
intent
to
extend
the
doctrine
to
more
than
just
ransom
or
reward.
if
i
may
address
myself
in
the
remaining
few
minutes
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
there
are
conflicting
stories
on
that.
the
factual
situation
as
indicated
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
is
that
all
three
of
these
individuals,
the
two
defendants
and
the
pilot
were
involved
in
a
joyride
situation
and
were
contributing
and
voluntarily
going
together
to
cuba.
they
extensively
rented
an
airplane
and
this
pilot
was
allegedly
giving
them
flying
lessons
and
then
they
proceeded
onto
cuba
in
its
position,
the
defendants
that
he
was
in
on
the
entire
situation.
they
were
going
to
cuba
to
take
photographs
to
sell
them
to
a
magazine
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
these
are
facts
that
have
not
--
that
are
not
in
the
indictment,
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure
of
this.
there's
nothing
alleged
on
this
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
--
that
particular
date,
whether
or
not
there
had
been
any
doctrines
set
out
by
the
state
department
or
not.
this
was
in
april
of
1962
and
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
don't
know
that,
i
cannot
answer
that.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir,
i
can.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
will
do
that.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
would
because
the
indictment
has
not
so
alleged.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i
still
feel
that
the
indictment
must
allege
an
unlawful
act
and
as
such,
the
transportation
if
it
were
unlawful
at
that
time
by
virtue
of
department
of
state
regulations
should
so
state.
the
indictment
should
so
state.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
that
it
should
make
reference
to
the
regulation,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
i
certainly
cannot
defend
the
--
the
morality
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
think
that
that
in
and
off
itself
maybe
--
may
make
one
subject
to
criminal
sanctions
but
not
necessarily
to
a
violation
of
the
federal
kidnapping
act.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well
there,
you're
referring
your
honor
to
the
restrain
of
the
individual.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
kidnapping
act
requires
you
go
further
than
merely
showing
the
restraint
that
the
restraint
in
and
off
itself
does
not
establish
kidnapping.
it
has
to
be
shown
to
be
for
a
purpose.
now,
the
restraint
is
not
simply
for
a
restraint
itself.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
if
it's
strictly
for
the
purpose
of
the
restraint
itself
because
they
just
wanted
to
restraint
the
man,
i
would
admit
that
this
would
probably
come
within
the
doctrine
of
kidnapping.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
alleged
to
be
for
a
specific
purpose
of
transportation.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
question
of
air
commerce
an
air
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
craft
in
flight
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
air
commerce.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
had
not
explored
that
thinking
because
i
thought
that
we
would
be
primarily
limited
in
our
thinking
to
what
was
in
the
record
in
the
indictment
itself.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
regulations
in
existence
at
that
time
when
you're
concerned
with
the
construction
of
--
of
a
statute
and
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
based
on
that
statute
would
have
the
--
should
necessarily
have
the
credence
of
judicial
knowledge
or
notice
upon
which
they
could
proceed.
i
think
that
the
government
here
should
have
argued
this
point
if
they
were
going
to
rely
on
it
and
they
have
not
and
this
--
it
nowhere
appears
on
the
briefs
or
we
would
have
responded
to
it
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
if
these
were
the
basis
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
if
these
were
the
basis
upon
which
they
would
proceed
but
they
haven't,
they've
alleged
a
specific
purpose.
the
question
of
aircraft
piracy
is
an
interesting
one
and
one
that
i
think
should
be
considered
by
this
court,
the
question
of
whether
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce
applies
only
to
commercial
airliners
engaged
in
the
carriage
of
goods
or
person
for
hire.
as
counsel
has
indicated,
the
indictment
charged
the
defendants
with
seizing
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce
and
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
the
allegations
that
it
is
a
four-passenger
cessna
172,
is
indicative
of
a
private
airliner
and
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
cover
only
commercial
airliners.
now,
we
strongly
support
this
conclusion.
we
urge
that
this
construction
be
upheld
or
in
the
alternative
that
this
statute
be
struck
as
unconstitutional
because
it's
vague
in
indefinite
terminology.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
statute
that
provides
for
the
death
penalty,
it
is
a
capital
crime.
now,
let
us
consider
for
a
few
moments
the
very
few
that
i
have
remaining
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
air
piracy,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
the
jury
can
recommend
death
--
death.
yes
sir.
otherwise,
it
is
a
period
of
years
up
to
life
imprisonment.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
--
in
this
particular
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes
sir.
in
the
air
piracy
it
is.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
the
statute
itself
reached
"whoever
commits
aircraft
piracy
shall
be
punishable"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
define
aircraft
piracy
as
"any
seizure
or
exercise
of
control
by
force
or
violence
of
any
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce."
now,
the
government
throughout
their
brief
in
their
argument
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
statute
reads
any
aircrafts.
it
does
not
read
any
aircraft.
it
reads
"an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce."
now,
they
say
that
when
congress
intended
to
refer
only
to
commercial
airliners,
they
knew
how
to
do
it
because
in
another
provision
of
this
same
act
when
it
was
amended
in
1961,
they
have
a
provision
referring
to
an
air
carrier
in
air
transportation
concerning
itself
with
concealed
weapons.
however,
this
argument
loses
much
of
its
weight
when
this
court
considers
and
in
still
another
section
passed
at
the
same
time,
section
1472
(j).
it
has
specifically
pointed
out
with
the
use
of
the
same
language
that
anyone
while
aboard
an
aircraft
in
flight
in
air
commerce
assaults,
intimidates
or
threatens
any
fight
crew
member
or
flight
attendant
including
stewards
and
stewardesses
of
such
aircrafts
so
as
to
interfere
with
the
manner
of
performance
shall
be
punished
by
the
following
penalties.
now,
here
the
use
of
the
same
language
not
any
aircraft
but
"an
aircraft
in
--
in
air
commerce"
specifically
referring
to
a
commercial
airliner,
in
the
very
next
section
of
the
one
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
interpretation
of.
now,
what
conclusion
can
we
reach?
the
government
says,
"let's
look
at
congressional
intent."
now,
we
say
it
is
not
overwhelming.
congressional
intent
indicates
that
the
use
of
the
words
"interstate
commerce"
or
"in
air
commerce"
was
used
that
this
broad
terminology
was
used
in
order
to
cover
foreign
as
well
domestic
flights
which
carry
large
numbers
of
passengers.
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
aviation
subcommittee,
representative
chelf
said
the
he
--
his
committee
hopes
to
draft
legislation
that
will
cover
the
cessna
commercial
airline
property.
representative
blatnik
said,
"the
piece
of
legislation
before
us
is
the
way
to
approach
the
problem
of
high
jacking
and
crimes
aboard
commercial
aircrafts."
representative
johansen
refers
to
the
proposed
legislation
as
any
civil
aircraft
used
or
employed
interstate
commerce.
and
this
particular
rephrasing,
any
civil
aircraft
was
used
in
his
proposed
legislation
and
this
i
think
would
clearly
cover
any
aircraft,
but
this
is
not
the
language
used
in
the
act
under
which
this
indictment
was
dismissed.
we
can
go
on,
representative
ingle
referred
to
by
counsel
here,
refers
to
incidents
aboard
commercial
airliners.
there's
a
need
for
this
type
of
legislation.
he
says,
"we
need
to
extend
federal
laws
of
piracy
on
the
high
seas
to
commercial
aircraft"
and
why
was
this
act
passed?
there
were
five
incidents
that
arose
that
prompted
the
passage
of
this
act
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief
within
the
congressional
record.
one
was
a
national
airlines
plane
that
was
forced
to
fly
to
cuba
on
may
1st.
another
is
an
--

robert
l.
shevin

jet.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
notice.
thank
you.
