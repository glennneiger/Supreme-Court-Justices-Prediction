mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
as
a
preparatory
remark,
i
would
like
to
express
my
gratitude
on
behalf
of
my
client,
winston
massiah,
for
the
right
to
present
this
case.
i
know
there
are
many
more
momentous
cases,
money
wise
but
i
think,
the
--
i
wish
to
thank
the
court
particularly
for
the
cooperation
they
have
assisted
me
in
having
the
briefs
printed
in
view
of
the
fact
that
my
client
was
incarcerated
and
indigent.
i
feel
that
it's
in
the
finest
traditions
of
our
free
country
and
it's
--
and
in
the
finest
traditions
in
its
concern
with
the
rights
of
individual
citizens.
thank
you,
your
honor.
before
going
into
the
law,
i
think
it's
necessary
in
this
case
to
deal
with
the
facts.
and
in
dealing
with
the
facts
in
this
case
i
think
there
are
three
dates
which
are
very
important.
excuse
me.
the
first
date
which
is
of
prime
importance,
which
i
think
we
should
commit
to
memory
is
may
6,
1958
because
on
may
6,
1958,
winston
massiah,
the
defendant,
appellant,
petitioner
here
was
arrested.
he
was
arrested
for
a
crime
of
smuggling,
smuggling
a
package
of
narcotics
across
on
a
ship
without
having
paid
the
tax.
that's
basically
the
indictment.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
massiah
was
a
seaman,
yes,
your
honor,
an
able-bodied
seaman,
that
was
his
rank.
on
that
date,
he
was
arrested
for
a
crime
which
allegedly
occurred
on
that
date
again,
may
6,
1958.
shortly
thereafter,
he
was
taken
to
custody,
he
was
questioned
by
the
federal
officers,
he
--
he
said
nothing
as
the
testimony
showed.
however,
he
retained
counsel
shortly
thereafter,
not
myself,
but
a
mr.
(inaudible).
and
short
time
later,
a
may
--
on
may
28,
1958,
he
was
indicted.
around
that
time,
i
was
retained
by
--
mr.
massiah
substituted
for
--
for
mr.
(inaudible).
and
i
remained
as
counsel
in
that
--
in
this
case
from
then
may
9th
--
may
28th,
1958
to
the
present.
at
the
time,
he
retained
counsel.
he
was
still
in
jail,
still
incarcerated.
subsequently,
after
motion
to
reduce
the
bail,
the
bail
was
lowered
and
he
was
out
on
bail.
at
the
time
that
i
was
retained,
i
spoke
--
the
first
person
to
whom
i
spoke
within
the
case
was
an
agent
finbarr
murphy,
a
very
key
figure
as
you
will
see
later
on.
my
retainer
and
my
appearance
was
on
the
record
from
approximately
the
28th
of
may,
1958
to
the
present.
what
happened
then?
nothing
happened
for
a
long
time.
there
was
no
prosecution.
there
were
delays.
there
were
adjournments.
there
were
many,
many
reasons
why
it
was
not
tried.
and
a
year
passed,
it
came
to
the
next
important
date
which
was
july
22nd,
1959.
and
on
july
22nd,
1959,
another
very
important
thing
happened
with
reference
to
the
case
here.
massiah,
the
defendant,
was
indicted
with
the
co-defendant,
jesse
colson.
now,
jesse
colson
was
indicted
for
the
same
crime
that
massiah
was
indicted
for.
if
you'll
notice
in
the
latter
pages
of
my
brief,
i
had
printed
each
one
of
the
indictments.
and
the
indictments,
as
you
will
see,
are
word
for
word
copies,
maybe
there
was
a
slight
variation
of
words
but
nothing
substantial
with
reference
to
the
massiah
and
colson
indictment,
all
that
was
done,
was
the
word
"colson"
was
added
and
jesse
colson.
the
--
the
indictment
was
essentially
the
same
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
had
been
but
not
at
this
point.
i
think
massiah
knew
him
vaguely
but
he
knew
him
also
from
the
--
their
residency
in
harlem
but
--
but
colson
wasn't
a
--
a
crew
member
around
that
time
or
before
that
time.
he
hadn't
--
had
--
hadn't
sailed
with
them
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
they
--
in
1958.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
right,
but
this
particular
trip,
colson
i
don't
believe
was
on
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
on
the
--
on
this
particular
trip.
i
think
the
record
shows
that.
but
they
both
had
seaman's
papers.
i
think
they're
both
able-bodied
seamen
also.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
colson
was
a
defendant.
yes,
in
the
--
the
1959,
no,
your
honor
and
this
is
easily
spotted
on
a
--
i'll
point
at
page
24
of
my
brief
and
that
was
the
first
indictment
that
was
against
the
united
states
of
america
versus
winston
massiah.
now,
the
1958
indictment
was
may
6,
1958.
the
allocation
was
the
date
of
the
crime.
again,
the
allocation
of
the
date
of
the
crime
was
again,
this
may
6th
date.
and
yet,
colson
and
massiah
were
indicted
on
--
on
july
22nd,
1959.
the
government,
at
that
time,
called
this
a
superseding
indictment,
sitting
over
the
other
indictment
and
they
dismissed
the
prior
indictment.
they
nullified
it
or
by
some
means
dismissed
the
prior
indictment
to
put
this
other
indictment.
and
if
you'll
examine
the
words,
you'll
find
all
that
was
added
was
the
word
"colson".
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
july
22nd,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
after
that,
again,
nothing
transpired.
this
was
about
a
year
after
the
original
indictment.
nothing
transpired
until
one
more
important
date
and
that
is
the
third
date
that
i
--
i
think
we
should
be
concerned
with
was
november
19th,
1959.
november
19th,
1959
was
the
date
of
the
conversation
in
the
automobile.
this
date
as
your
honors
can
very
easily
subtract
was
approximately
one
year
and
a
half
after
the
original
arrest
and
after
the
alleged
crime
had
been
committed.
this
conversation
was
a
very
important
conversation.
and
this
conversation,
i
might
say,
was
the
heart
of
the
government's
case.
now,
how
did
this
conversation
take
place?
the
conversation
took
place
very
simply
and
easily.
the
government
had
prevailed
upon
colson,
colson
being
in
a
lesser
fortunate
position
than
massiah.
he
had
a
record,
massiah
had
no
record.
government
prevailed
upon
colson
to
cooperate
with
the
government
and
their
terms
of
cooperation
consisted
in
the
following
facts.
finbarr
murphy,
fine
gentleman
who
i
respect
but
was
involved
in
this,
working
for
the
government,
finbarr
murphy,
working
for
the
u.s.
attorney,
finbarr
murphy
was
the
--
i
would
almost
sequest
as
the
majordomo
of
this
case,
he
heard
the
case
backwards,
forwards,
better
than
even
i
could
understand
it.
i
have
to
having
leave
with
it
for
a
long
time.
but
murphy
said
this,
he
said
to
colson
or
arranged
with
colson
to
get
massiah
into
a
conversation
and
there
would
be
an
electronic
device
transcribing
and
eavesdropping
on
this
conversation.
this
conversation
took
place
on
a
very
cool
night
in
harlem
in
the
automobile
of
jesse
colson,
a
chrysler
imperial
i
think
the
testimony
was.
and
jesse
colson
called
massiah
to
speak
with
him
privately.
they
wouldn't
talk
on
the
phone
because
what
they
had
to
say,
they
didn't
want
or
won't
discuss
over
the
phone.
so
they
were
to
speak
privately
in
his
automobile.
the
windows
were
closed
and
underneath
the
front
seat,
unbeknownst
to
massiah,
are
--
was
this
schmidt
transmitter.
this
transmitter
transmitted
the
conversation
of
the
participants
in
the
front
seat
and
transmitted
it
back
about
a
half
of
a
block
to
the
--
the
automobile
of
finbarr
murphy.
now,
finbarr
murphy
sat,
taking
this
information
with
earphones
on
his
head,
listening
to
the
complete
conversation.
in
addition,
finbarr
murphy
did
something
further,
he
had
a
--
a
wire
--
a
tape
recording,
recording
this
conversation.
this
conversation
i
think
took
at
least
two
hours,
possibly
three
hours.
a
great
deal
was
said
in
this
conversation.
i
point
that
out
but
i'll
deal
with
it
at
great
length
later
that,
at
the
time,
murphy
knew
i
was
his
counsel.
at
the
time,
the
u.s.
attorney
knew,
i
was
his
counsel.
and
at
the
time,
i
think
jesse
colson
even
knew
i
was
his
counsel
because
we
both
appeared,
i
appeared
and
his
attorney
e.k.
jones
appeared
at
the
indictment
and
arraignment
at
the
superseding
indictment.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
the
only
thing
i
could
say
is
they
hoarse
the
record
after
the
--
after
their
--
the
transcript
was
taken,
i
was
called
then
sometime
after
and
they
told
me
that
they
knew
about
it
and
they
played
the
record
for
me
for
about
two
hours.
but
that's
no
hoarse
the
record
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that.
i
--
i
would
say
that
this,
let's
assume
that
he
knew
of
it
but
i
think
it
shouldn't
put
a
premium
on
his
--
on
his
blindness
on
that
fact
that
he
closed
his
eyes
to
such
a
transaction
and
the
government
was
finbarr
murphy
in
this
said
situation.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
was
a
customs
agent.
he
was
a
custom
--
a
former
new
york
policeman
who,
at
that
time,
was
working
as
a
customs
agent.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
the
united
states
government,
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
mr.
--
i
think
it
was
starkey
at
the
time.
they
were
a
number
of
u.s.
attorneys
but
it
was
mr.
starkey
at
the
time.
but
as
i
say,
i
wouldn't
want
to
go
into
that
because
i
don't
believe
we
have
to.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
into
the
question.
the
fact
that
it
was
done
and
i
think,
they
shouldn't
obtain
the
benefit
of
it.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
but
as
--
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
astray.
i
heard
they
described
as
an
automobile
ride,
it
wasn't.
i
--
i
sort,
in
many
other
times,
described
in
--
in
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
the
car
was
parked,
yes.
the
car
was
parked
in
front
of
murphy.
murphy
was
about
a
half
a
block
away.
and
all
that
murphy
could
see
was,
as
he
testified,
was
colson
in
the
car,
i
think
at
the
driver's
seat,
and
massiah
sitting
next
to
him
in
their
heads
and
they're
talking.
that
was
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
no.
no,
it
wasn't
moving.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
sitting
in
the
automobile.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
--
the
--
well,
the
tape
was
a
very
large
tape
and
i
--
i
sat
there
the
night
that
it
was
played
for
me
for
approximately
two
hours,
i
believe.
but
i
don't
know
if
that
was
the
whole
conversation,
as
i
said.
there
might
have
been
more.
now
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
with
reference
--
they
called
me
into
hear
the
tape
with
reference
to
obtaining
mr.
massiah's
cooperation
and
possibly
pleading
guilty,
which
mr.
massiah
decided
not
to
do.
i
did
make
objection
to
the
tape
at
that
time
but
we
didn't
go
into
any
legal
argument.
they
said
nothing,
i
said
nothing.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
pleaded
guilty
and
he
--
he
seems
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
receives
a
--
on
a
lighter
sentence
under
the
circumstances,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
think
it
was
six
years,
i
believe.
i
--
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
nine
years,
your
honor.
when
the
trial
came
up
i
think
the
next
point
and
the
next
date
in
our
facts
is
important.
the
trial
came
up
and
the
first
person
that
they
put
on
the
stand,
as
i
say
the
heart
of
the
government's
case,
was
this
jesse
colson.
jesse
colson
got
on
the
stand,
who
--
asked
a
few
questions
by
the
united
states
attorney
and
he
got
up
and
you've
read
the
record
and
said,
"i'm
afraid,
my
wife,
my
children
have
been
threatened.
i'm
not
going
to
testify."
and
he
--
he
invoked
the
--
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
i
wish
to
point
out,
there
was
never
any
time
that
these
threats
were
ever
connected
with
massiah,
never.
if
they
were
connected
with
anyone,
they
were
connected
with
aiken.
i
--
i
think
there
was
a
slight
hint
that
might've
been
connected
with
aiken.
and
massiah
testified
that
he
never
seen
aiken
before
in
his
life.
and
there
was
no
connection
in
the
trial
between
massiah
and
aiken.
the
district
judge
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
aiken
was
tried
and
aiken
was
convicted,
however,
the
convictions
have
been
reversed
and
aiken
was
waiting
trial
again
by
virtue
of
--
the
conviction
were
reversed
on
the
grounds
of
--
as
--
as
you
probably
know,
on
the
grounds
that
were
charged
that
the
judge
had
made
improper
charge
to
the
jury
and
the
reversal
came
from
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
that's
correct,
on
page
26,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
wait,
he
was
john
doe?
he
was
john
doe,
he
was
leon
aiken
and
john
doe
also
known
as
leon,
meaning,
thereby,
to
describe
a
negro
male
of
medium
complexion
with
black
hair
and
medium
build,
approximately
40
years
of
age,
approximately
five
feet
nine
inches
tall
and
weighing
approximately
165
pounds.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
that
was
the
one
who
is
later
called
aiken.
and
there
was
a
big
objection
made
at
the
trial
as
to
the
description
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
into
that.
from
--
from
the
time
of
november
19th,
1959
and
the
conversation
with
colson,
again,
aside
from
the
conversation
that
i
had
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
very
little
was
done.
i
had
made
motions
even
before
for
bill
of
particulars
and
for
many
other
pieces
of
evidence
and
finally,
the
case
came
to
trial.
when
the
case
came
to
trial
in
the
summer
of
1961,
i
said
that
colson
took
the
stand
and
colson
said
he
--
he
was
threatened.
he
said,
notice
he
said,
"i
invoke
my
rights
of
the
--
under
the
fifth
amendment."
well,
being
there,
he
decided
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
i
think
the
government
might've
been
able
to
give
him
immunity
under
this
--
under
this
contention.
also,
aiken
was
in
a
nefarious
character.
aiken
was
not
a
believable
person.
how
do
we
ever
know
that
he
was
ever
threatened?
how
do
we
know
the
--
know
that
this
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
colson,
i'm
sorry
for
that.
colson
was
in
a
nefarious
character.
how
did
we
ever
know
that
colson
was
ever
threatened
in
these
circumstances?
how
do
we
know
that
maybe
this
was
his
excuse
to
get
off
the
hook?
maybe
it
was
his
excuse
to
--
to
dodge
the
--
the
decision
that
he
had
made
to
cooperate
with
the
government.
i
point
this
out
and
i
point
that
again
that
he
had
i
think
he
had
shot
a
man
previously
and
he
might've
had
some
fear
but
we
don't
know
what
his
fears
were
and
we
can't
go
into
him
because
he
didn't
testify.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
it's
in
the
government's
brief,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
think
the
government
brought
it
into
show
that
--
show
that
they
had
attempt.
here
it
is.
but
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
transcript.
they
say
that
they
relate
to
the
transcript,
page
68
and
70.
gee,
i
can't
go
on
with
this.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
alright,
fine.
my
wife
and
kids
and
then
it
states
--
states
at
pages
68
and
70.
well,
not
putting,
not
putting
colson
on
the
stand
and
the
--
the
manner
in
which
colson
performed
before
the
jury,
the
defense
counsel
made
motions
for
a
mistrial.
these
motions
were
denied
immediately
but
the
next
day,
the
judge
granted
the
--
after
reconsideration,
he
granted
the
mistrial.
the
government
started
their
case
and
they
proceeded
with
their
case
with
their
threads
of
--
of
circumstantial
evidence.
betty
lloyd
who
was
the
former
girlfriend
of
massiah,
who
is
testifying
against
him,
the
tape
that
they
said
matched
the
tape
in
massiah's
room
and
many
other
small,
as
i
say,
threads
of
circumstantial
evidence.
again,
they
--
they
--
i
--
i
believe
they
were
worried
about
their
case,
worried
about
proving
it
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
so,
not
having
colson,
what
did
they
do?
they
brought
in
agent
finbarr
murphy.
they
brought
in
agent
finbarr
murphy
with
the
tape.
they
brought
in
agent
finbarr
murphy
with
a
stenographic
transcript
of
what
the
conversation
was
on
the
tape.
now,
at
the
time
that
they
put
agent
finbarr
murphy
on
the
stand,
so
testify,
counsel
made
serious
objection,
defense
counsel,
the
person,
myself,
meant
serious
objection.
my
objections
were
--
were
twofold
on
two
separate
occasions.
i
set
them
forth
on
page
15
and
page
19
of
my
brief.
they
essentially
say
this,
that
the
objection
to
mr.
murphy's
testimony
is
that
it
violates
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
it
constituted,
i
use
the
word
"constituted
eavesdropping"
and
also
was
a
tape
recording.
i
reiterated
on
page
19
what
i
meant
by
the
reason
for
the
tape
recording.
in
that,
it
was
an
inanimate
recording
and
not
selective
of
what
was
heard.
at
the
time
of
this
tape
recording,
a
great
many
things
in
two
hours
were
discussed.
i
was
discussed,
my
merits
were
discussed,
many
confidential
communications
were
discussed.
there
are
great
many
things
were
discussed.
and
i
said
because
of
its
non-selectivity,
how
reliable
it
is,
how
probative
is
it
and
the
like.
i
added
to
that
that
it
did
not
bring
in
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses.
it
did
not
show
not
only
what
was
said
but
how
was
it
was
said.
what
--
what
were
the
circumstances
surrounding
it?
it's
a
--
almost
a
fundamental
law
of
evidence
that
a
--
admission
against
interest
--
you
can
always
explain
the
circumstances
surrounding
an
admission
against
interest.
these
could
not
be
done.
these
could
not
be
done
by
finbarr
murphy,
it
could
only
be
done
by
colson.
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
massiah
because
massiah
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
but
colson
is
the
one
who
was
there.
and
in
this
situation,
as
i
said,
all
finbarr
murphy
did
was
see
heads
in
the
back
of
the
car.
we
would
never
know
whether
colson
had
a
gun
up
against
massiah
at
the
time.
he
couldn't
see
it
would
be
the
back
of
the
car
but
the
--
i'm
not
alleging
that.
we
don't
really
know
what
happened
at
the
time
but
this
is
important.
again,
the
right
of
cross-examination
foundation
with
reference
to
colson
is
--
with
reference
in
colson
is
in
the
nefarious
character
with
reference
to
his
background,
with
reference
to
how
reliable
a
witness
is.
this
was
all
circumvented,
this
was
all
aviated
by
the
fact
they
have
the
agent
testified.
they
sort
of
sanitized
themselves
in
a
certain
way.
but
i
pointed
out
again
on
page
19
that
the
most
reliable
evidence
would
be
the
evidence
of
--
of
colson's
testimony.
i
made
an
analogy
between
the
photograph.
they
introduced
photograph
of
the
tape,
the
adhesive
tape
and
they
said
that
the
--
it
matched
by
virtue
of
the
photograph
and
the
judge
wouldn't
allow
the
photograph.
he
said
the
tape
is
the
best
evidence.
in
likewise
manner,
the
--
the
statements
of
colson
is
the
best
evidence.
over
objection
--
over
objection
the
evidence
was
introduced
and
why
do
--
what
--
what
decision
could
the
judge
hang
his
head
upon?
he
hang
his
head
upon
the
on
lee
case.
that
was
--
that
was
the
case
upon
which
he
decided
to
allow
the
evidence.
the
5-to-4
decision
of
the
on
lee
case
which
the
chief
justice
has
recently
said
in
the
lopez
case
was
wrongly
decided
and
should
not
be
revitalized.
well,
we
go
along
with
that
that
the
on
lee
case
was
wrongly
decided
and
should
not
be
revitalized.
if
the
discussing
effects
i
think
we
come
to
a
point
as
to
why
this
case
is
important.
why
it
has
--
i
--
i
think
great
effect
and
why
it's
almost
a
landmark
case,
not
because
it
involves
a
little
man
like
massiah
or
because,
i'm
arguing
it,
the
question
is
this,
it
has
a
great
many
principles
running
through
it.
if
we
learned
in
geometry
that
a
point
can
be
crossed
by
any
number
of
straight
lines,
well,
i
would
say,
the
circumstances
of
a
case
can
be
crossed
by
many,
many
principles,
especially
constitutional
or
otherwise.
if
we
would
take
that
massiah's
circumstances
as
a
point
in
our
mind,
a
mythical
point
in
our
mind,
we
would
cross
it
first
with
the
line
of
the
fifth
amendment
--
of
--
of
the
sixth
amendment,
i'm
sorry,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
of
counsel,
the
right
of
confrontation,
the
right
of
cross-examination.
i'll
deal
with
these
points
more
fully
but
i
just
want
to
show
the
court
by
way
of
tribute,
these
--
these
simple
principles
that
are
concerned
basically.
again,
the
next
principle
i
would
cross
to
the
massiah
case
would
be
the
fifth
amendment,
the
right
of
self-incrimination
and
due
process
under
fifth
amendment.
again,
another
principle
that
crosses
through
this
massiah
case
is
canon
9
of
the
--
of
ethics
of
the
american
--
the
canons
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association,
which
are
a
--
a
lawyer's
repetition
just
for
--
of
necessity
for
the
sixth
amendment.
we
also
have
rule
93
of
the
rule-making
power,
the
question
of
fundamental
fairness.
this
crosses
though
the
facts
in
the
massiah
case.
by
other
principles,
we
have
the
right
of
privacy
is
also
concerned
with
this
particular
case.
we
have
again
the
fourth
amendment,
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
if
they
cannot
get
it
one
way,
they
get
the
same
thing
by
a
more
subtle
and
sophisticated
way.
they
cannot
go
into
drawers
of
my
desk
and
get
my
file
but
they
can
get
my
case
in
--
in
other
manners.
in
addition,
we
have
a
question
of
free
speech.
if
we
are
to
be
bound
by
the
--
the
idea
that
all
conversations
would
be
eavesdrop
so
readily
and
so
freely,
then
it
might
--
it
might
--
make
people
hesitate
from
expressing
either
on
popular
ideas
or
confidential
communications
with
reference
to
the
first
point,
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
of
counsel.
your
honors
well
ruled
recently
in
the
spano
case,
that
the
right
of
counsel
is
a
very
important
right
also
in
gideon
versus
wainwright,
was
a
very
important
right.
and
in
spano,
spano
was,
i
believe,
under
indictment.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
was
under
indictment
and
he
had
retained
counsel.
his
counsel
was
not
present.
he
was
dealt
with
directly
through
the
prosecutor's
office.
judge
hayes,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
--
in
the
massiah
case,
coined
a
phrase
which
i
think
is
the
essence
of
this
case.
the
government
should
deal
through
counsel,
not
around
the
counsel,
and
this
is
what
happened
in
the
line
of
cases
that
we've
--
we've
seen.
we
--
the
prosecuting
agent
dealt
around
counsel,
not
through
counsel.
the
mcnabb,
the
mallory
cases
and
the
weeks
case,
all
show
where
the
right
of
counsel
was
deprived.
we
have
a
case,
white
versus
maryland,
where
the
person
was
not
in
an
automobile,
not
in
the
clandestine
fictitious
situation
as
we
have
here
but
was
in
a
--
in
a
magistrates
court
and
yet,
at
the
admissions
that
he
made
at
that
time
were
precluded
on
the
ground
that
his
right
of
counsel
was
violated.
we
have
a
whole
line,
which
was
stated
in
the
brief,
a
whole
line
of
new
york
cases,
davis,
di
biasi,
meyer,
meyer
which
was
stated
by
the
--
as
a
footnote
in
the
chief
justice's
decision
in
the
lopez
case.
we
have
waterman,
swanson
and
robinson.
robinson
was
recently
reaffirmed
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
though
we
have
all
these
cases
we've
show
had
a
right
of
counsel.
these
cases
were,
generally,
around
the
time
of
arraignment,
post-arraignment,
pre-indictment
or
pre-arraignment,
post-indictment,
a
variation
of
that
type
around
this.
here,
we
have
the
indictment,
the
arraignment,
the
setting
of
the
bail.
he
was
out
on
bail.
he
had
counsel
for
over
a
year
and
a
half
and
yet,
the
government
dealt
around
counsel,
not
through
a
counsel.
there's
a
very
important
recent
case
with
--
which
would
bares
on
this.
this
was
griffith
versus
rhay,
a
ninth
circuit
case,
282
f.2d
711.
and
in
griffith
versus
rhay,
again,
there
was
no
question
of
coercion
as
in
many
of
this
other
case.
there
was
no
serious
question
of
coercion.
but
in
griffith
versus
rhay,
the
man
was
told
of
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
was
not
told
of
his
right
of
counsel.
in
that
case,
the
courts
held
that
any
evidence
that
he
gave
subsequent
thereto
was
--
was
precluded
and
recently,
certiorari
was
denied
in
that
case
but
i
think
this
shows
even
a
suspect.
this
man
was
not
arrested,
he
was
not
indicted,
he
was
not
arraigned
but
he
was
a
suspect
and
the
courts
held
that
his
right
of
counsel
was
violated.
the
next
important
point
would
be
fifth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
is
--
as
the
amendment
as
you
know,
the
point
is
--
is
self-incrimination.
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
are
interrelated.
it's
--
it
has
to
be,
to
some
extent,
that
way
because
if
you
have,
but
i
think
the
more
important
thing
is
the
fifth
amendment,
if
you
have
a
right
against
self-incrimination,
then
you
have
a
right
to
have
that
right
protected.
and
the
right
to
have
that
right
protected
is
by
virtue
of
your
right
of
counsel.
the
new
york
cases
stated
this,
the
whole
line
that
i
stated,
not
only
went
off
on
the
right
of
counsel
but
also
i
--
i
only
mentioned
the
right
of
counsel
but
also
i
mention
that
the
fifth
amendment,
showing
how
intertwined
these
--
these
cases
were.
the
--
there
were
a
line
of
cases
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
with
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment.
these
cases
were
bram,
bullock
and
brock.
i'll
take
care
of
the
easiest
one,
bullock
which
a
--
was
a
case
in
this
area
where
a
negro
was
--
was
beat
up
in
a
police
station
and
his
evidence
and
the
--
and
the
evidence
after
his
submission
was
set
aside
and
precluded.
we
don't
have
a
question
of
physical
beating.
we
don't
have
the
question
like
that
but
you
can
--
you
can
persuade,
you
can
entice,
you
can
obtain
this
evidence
in
--
in
ways
that
are
may
--
maybe
more
subtle
and
yet,
the
courts
have
held
that
this
manner
in
which
this
evidence
is
obtained
and
introduced
is
--
is
not
admissible.
a
good
case
was
the
case
of
bram.
bram,
the
bram
case
which
was
cited
in
our
brief
was
a
case
of
a
sailor,
strangely
we
have
a
sailor
up
in
nova
scotia
who
was
accused
of
complicity
in
the
crime
and
bram
was
taken
into
a
--
an
office
by
a
--
a
halifax
officer,
police
officer.
he
was
stripped
in
a
ways
that
he
was
question.
he
made
certain
damaging
admissions.
the
court
said
that
these
admissions
were
not
admissible
because
he
wasn't
aware
and
had
no
opportunity
to
avail
himself
of
the
right
of
self-incrimination.
another
interesting
case
on
the
fifth
amendment
was
brock.
and
in
brock,
we
have
a
case
where
there
was
a
steel.
and
this
man
was
sleeping
in
a
house
near
this
steel.
the
federal
officers,
the
revenuers
came
and
they
--
they
spoke
with
him,
and
the
gentlemen
who
was
asleep
got
up
and
waived
his
hand
and
said,
"get
away"
and
he
was
actually
asleep.
then,
they
--
they
saw
that
he
was
really
in
a
deep
sleep
but
he
would
speak
in
his
sleep
and
they
questioned
him.
they
got
admissions
against
his
interest.
and
then
the
government
agencies
--
agents
admitted,
they
went
in
and
shook
him
and
woke
him
up
finally.
the
court
was
--
held
that
this
evidence
was
not
admissible.
i
would
not
say
that
massiah
was
asleep
at
the
time
but
they
did
take
a
great
unfair
advantage
and
he
might
have
been,
how
would
you
say,
legally
asleep
at
the
time
which
his
lawyer
would
not
be
legally
asleep.
he
probably
was
lolled
in
a
--
in
a
sense
of
false
security
in
the
idea
that
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
indictment.
colson
was
a
--
a
former
co-acquaintance
of
his.
they
were
both
--
they
were
both
indicted
and
they
were
both
defendants
in
the
case
and
maybe
they
should
work
together
to
defend
themselves
for
their
mutual
interest.
but
i
say
that
these
cases
show
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
protected.
now,
the
next
point
is
canon
9
of
the
canons
of
legal
ethics.
i
raise
this
point
not
to
disbar
or
--
or
call
ethics
on
--
on
a
fellow
attorney
for
affirming.
most
of
the
u.s.
attorneys
with
whom
--
with
whom
i
dealt
have
been
fine
and
gentle
individuals
and
i
have
no
complaint
along
those
lines.
however,
in
a
law
review,
42
nebraska
law
review,
600
and
605,
professor
broder
states
that
the
massiah
case,
this
case,
is
the
only
case
that
brought
into
--
into
focus
canon
9
of
the
canons
of
professional
ethics.
and
what
does
this
canon
say?
the
canon
simply
says,
"i
shall
not
deal
with
my
adversary's
client
directly."
that's
--
that
simply.
and
i
--
i
will
not
--
as
a
corollary
to
it,
i
will
not
have
any
agents
of
mine
doing
so.
now,
the
--
the
professor
in
the
article
points
out
this,
and
--
and
i
think
he
makes
a
very
good
point.
he
says
--
let's
take
the
example
with
a
civil
action,
a
negligence
case,
a
$50
property
damage
case.
if
my
adversary's
client
want
--
were
suing
me
for
negligence
in
a
$50
property
damage
case,
i
could
not
deal
with
him
directly.
i
would
probably
be
censured
for
doing
such
a
thing
or
if
i
had
my
insurance
adjuster
dealing
with
the
client
directly
once
knowing
that
--
that
counsel
has
been
retained,
i
could
not
do
it.
well,
if
this
is
so
and
all
that
rights
are
protected
under
a
--
a
property
rights,
how
much
more
should
a
person's
rights
be
for
a
$50
property
damage
to
nine
years
in
--
in
the
atlanta
penitentiary?
i
feel
that
this
--
this
is
a
good
point
well-made
and
that
the
--
what
good
is
your
right
of
counsel,
what
good
is
the
--
the
canon
of
ethics
if
the
government
can
take
them
in,
question
them,
pamper
for
admissions,
train
and
try
and
then
turn
them
back
to
counsel.
the
argument
has
also
made
that
the
canon
bares
on
the
sixth
amendment,
the
violation
--
that
the
violation
of
this
canon
is
a
violation
of
right
of
counsel
per
se.
it
also
states
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
violated
by
the
violation
of
this
canon.
i've
also
cited
(inaudible)
on
legal
ethics.
the
next
point
which
i
wish
--
wish
to
bring
up
is
the
rule-making
power,
rule
93.
the
--
this
--
i
feel
that
even
if
we
do
not
wish
to
go
to
constitutional
questions,
the
reprehensible
act
here
should
be
precluded
if
only
by
the
rule-making
power
because
we
have
the
question
of
fundamental
fair
play
and
fundamental
justice
herein.
the
--
justice
black
--
mr.
justice
black
in
the
on
lee
dissent
cited
that
on
lee
--
the
evidence
in
on
lee
should
not
be
admitted
if
only
for
the
rule-making
power.
it
did
not
go
along
with
the
right
of
privacy
argument
but
he
said
in
the
rule-making
power.
in
a
harvard
law
review,
they
--
they
succinctly
crystallized
the
rule-making
power
stating,
"since
the
prime
rationale
for
the
supervisory
power
relates
to
the
integrity
of
judicial
process,
the
court
should
be
able
to
exclude
evidence
derived
from
tactics
which,
though
not
unlawful,
are
so
unfair
that
their
toleration
would
force
--
force
the
disrespect
of
the
law
or
impair
confidence
in
its
administration."
i
say
that
is
the
rationale
and
i
endorse
that
completely.
the
chief
--
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
lopez
case,
in
his
concurring
opinion,
went
to
the
extent
to
go
--
go
deeper
into
this
question
of
the
rule-making
power.
he
pointed
out,
either
directly
or
indirectly,
what
the
harms
and
dangers
are
in
allowing
this
type
of
evidence.
he
pointed
out,
i
would
say,
indirectly
but
it
was
pointed
out,
that
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination
of
the
informant,
who
was
really,
i
would
call
a
so-called
"informant"
because
he
was
an
informant
before
the
fact
as
to
the
crime.
he
was
an
informant
to
pump
mr.
massiah
to
violate
his
--
his
rights
of
counsel.
but
let's
call
him
the
informant
just
for
the
--
for
a
label.
the
informant
did
not
take
the
stand.
we
couldn't
see
his
--
his
manner
of
testifying.
we
couldn't
cross-examine
the
informant.
confrontation
is
a
right
guaranteed
under
the
sixth
amendment.
cross-examination,
that's
only
inferentially
derived
from
that
but
it's
--
it's
a
right
under
the
sixth
amendment.
again,
the
demeanor,
how
--
how
he
said
these
things.
again,
another
very
important
point
was
the
whereabouts,
the
domicile
of
colson.
colson
at
that
time
was
being
protected
by
the
government.
we
didn't
know
where
he
was.
we
didn't
know
at
all
where
he
lives.
and
a
person
has
--
there
--
there
are
numerous
cases
where
a
person
who's
going
to
testify
has
to
state,
"i
live
in
such
and
such
a
place."
whether
--
if
only
for
the
reason
that
we
can
impeach
his
reputation
for
truth
and
veracity
in
the
community
in
which
he
lives,
that
everyone
in
the
community
knows
he's
a
liar.
but
we
never
knew
his
whereabouts
in
this
situation.
again
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
and
i
--
i
asked
that
very
vehemently
in
the
--
in
my
--
in
my
objections.i
said
they
should
produce
colson.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
page
19,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
alright.
again,
as
i
say,
in
--
in
knowing
his
whereabouts,
we
may
know
his
bias.
we
may
know
that
he
always
--
this
light,
massiah,
for
one
reason
or
--
or
another.
this
is
the
question
of
his
domicile
which
was
not
brought
in.
again,
by
allowing
the
sanitary
proof
or
the
insulated
proof
of
the
agent,
we
lose
another
very
important
point
in
the
--
in
the
circumstances,
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
conversation
and
that
is
whether
there
were
any
other
monitored
or
unmonitored,
this
was
set
forth
by
the
chief
justice,
any
other
monitored
or
unmonitored
conversations
taken
by
colson
with
--
made
by
colson
with
massiah
which
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
way
massiah
spoke.
again,
we
have
another
point
at
which
the
chief
justice
may,
that
the
friendship
approach,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
what
persuasion
whether
it
was
physical,
whether
it
was
mental,
whether
it
was
psychological,
whether
it
was
as
in
spano,
where
they
appealed
saying
"my
wife
and
children,
my
wife
is
having
a
baby,
i'll
lose
my
job."
we
don't
know
what
the
--
what
the
persuasion
was
because
colson
didn't
testify.
and
we
don't
know
what
persuasion
was.
i
would
just
venture
to
say
that
the
fact
that
colson
and
massiah
were
both
co-defendants
in
the
case
and
the
fact
that
massiah
thought
that
colson
was
--
was
still
co-defendant
and
not
a
federal
agent,
would
indicate
that
there
might
have
been
a
--
a
pooling
of
efforts
or
a
persuasion
to
that
effect.
we
don't
know
and
that's
a
big
thing.
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
any
coercion.
again,
the
reliability,
the
machine
was
not
select,
not
only
couldn't
select
but
it
couldn't
tell
whether
the
conversation
that
took
place
had
just
speculations,
it
had
--
whether
it
had
no
answers
and
whether
it
had,
my
--
my
adversary
mentions,
every
new
ones
is
important.
i
say
every
new
ones
is
important.
what
was
said,
how
would
we
said,
what
the
canes
was,
where
the
intonation,
where
the
emphasis
was,
what
the
slang
involved
was.
these
--
all
these
things
were
involved.
language,
the
purpose
of
language
is
to
convey
meaning
but
words
are
only
one
part
of
it.
it's
a
big
difference
as
you
and
i
know
to
read
a
--
a
transcript
of
a
record
and
be
at
the
trial.
it's
a
big
difference
to
hear
a
fight
on
the
radio
and
then
see
it
in
television
or
see
it
in
person
or
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
no,
but
it
was
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
yes,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
don't
think
so
because
the
--
because
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
excuse
me,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
probably,
but
except
for
this,
the
--
the
recording
wasn't
that
clear.
i
--
i
would
say
this
candidly
for
the
court.
when
i
heard
it,
i
could
distinguish
the
voices
of
massiah
and
colson
slightly.
i
will
--
wouldn't
say
that
you
couldn't
distinguish.
but
further
than
that,
you
couldn't
get
too
much
because
they
were
cars
going
by,
there
was
--
there
was
some
noise
and
considerable
noise
on
the
tape.
but
as
for
--
as
for
--
as
i
say
gestures,
you
would
never
get
on
the
tape
and
as
for
facial
expressions,
which
are
very
important,
you
would
never
get
them
on
the
tape,
and
as
for
--
as
i
said
whether
there
(inaudible)
on
that,
you
would
never
get
these
on
the
tape.
but
on
the
question
of
reliability,
your
honor,
which
you
--
i
think
you
bring
up,
we
have
a
--
a
very
difficult
situation
in
this
case
because
even
if
you
don't
have
colson
testifying,
what
you
have
was
the
electronic
transmission
of
the
conversation
into
the
ear
of
murphy
and
then
from
the
ear
of
murphy
into
a
tape
that
was
going
on
and
then
murphy
was
directed
to
testify
as
to
what
is
recollection
of
the
conversation
was
basically
from
the
tape.
so
again,
we
go
back
from
the
tape
into
murphy's
ear,
through
murphy's
mind
and
particular
portions
which
he
thought
were
relevant,
and
only
with
reference
to
what
massiah
have
said,
not
generally
what
colson
said.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
murphy
did
hear
it
simultaneously.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
if
the
--
if
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
correct.
but
after
a
year
and
after
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
--
they
had
the
transcript
of
the
record
and
after
they
had,
he
had
played
the
tape
over
and
over
again.
i
--
i
think
it
might
be
inferred
that
a
lot
of
his
knowledge
came
from
his
recollection
of
what
went
on
with
the
tape
because
he
didn't
see
any
facial
expression.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
believe
so,
yes.
and
it
was
objected
to
him.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
it
was
objected
to
--
on
the
grounds
and
it
was
in
--
inanimate
object.
it
was
--
wasn't
sworn
to.
it
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
and
--
and
in
addition,
we
never
knew
whether
it
was
the
whole
conversation,
whether
it
was
part
of
the
conversation
and
the
court
allowed
under
the
on
lee
case
that
the
tape,
itself,
was
not
evidentiary
that
the
--
on
the
--
under
the
on
lee
case,
there
was
a
testimony
of
the
hearing
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
particular
case.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
at
the
time
murphy
testified.
murphy
took
the
stand
and
he
was
called
to
tell
about
the
tape
and
--
while
--
while
murphy
was
testifying,
the
offer
was
made.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
i
can
distinguish
on
lee
a
--
away
if
you
don't
wish
to
reverse
it.
i
could
say
that
the
points
of
--
of
right
of
counsel
was
never
raised
in
on
lee.
on
lee
didn't
--
at
the
--
as
far
as
i
know,
on
lee
didn't
have
any
counsel
at
the
time.
and
in
addition
to
which,
if
on
lee
was
in
--
in
the
--
the
evidence
that
was
taken
with
on
lee
was
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
crime.
i
think
he
went
into
the
store
and
said,
"do
you
have
the
--
the
opium
under
the
counter?"
and
he
said,
"yes,
i
have
the
opium
under
--
under
the
counter."
he
was
way
off
the
sound.
and
he
--
and
the
agent
heard
it.
i
--
i
say,
for
those
two
reasons,
basically,
we
can
distinguish
on
lee
away
because
of
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
right
of
--
again,
this
was
close
to
the
time
of
his
arrest.
with
--
with
our
case,
it's
a
year
and
half
after
and
a
year
and
a
half
after
i
passed
wherein
they
were
dealing
with
counsel.
again,
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
brought
the
on
lee
because
the
postscript
to
the
on
lee
case
and
then
finally,
i
think
almost
bares
this
out,
because
on
lee
later
move
for
a
new
trial
and
the
--
and
in
his
motion
for
new
trial,
it
was
based
on
an
affidavit
stating
that
the
informant,
the
so-called
"informant"
came
in
and
he
--
his
affidavit
said,
"i
lied."
that
conversation
never
took
place
in
on
lee's
laundry.
this
was
the
so-called
"informant",
which
these
informants
are
unreliable
persons.
secondly,
in
addition,
on
lee
said
this
that
the
agent
for
the
government,
who
heard
the
conversation
and
testified,
was
recently
dismissed
for
improper
activity,
particularly
the
type
in
--
in
concern
with
on
lee,
where
he
obtained
evidence
that
never
actually
happened
on
some
of
these
argument.
so
i
point
out
that
this
is
an
example
how
unreliable
this
evidence
is.
there
were
references
also
to
--
to
justice
potter
stewart's
answer
about
--
question
about
the
reliability
of
murphy's
recollection.
murphy
was
not
free
from
motivation,
as
my
adversary
would
have
you
believe
in
his
self-serving
declarations
about
the
reliability
of
--
of
government
agents.
you
and
i
know
that
they're
human
too.
they
could
make
mistakes
and
they
could
be
unreliable.
in
on
lee,
they
were
unreliable.
and
in
addition,
picture
for
yourself,
the
idea
of
this
--
finbarr
murphy
was
a
big,
tall
irish
fellow
who
had
--
had
the
earphones
and
he's
sitting
up
in
harlem,
listening
to
this
conversation
and
--
and
it's
late
at
night
and
he's
still
engaged
in
this
dirty
business
and
he's
sitting
for
three
hours
and
he
doesn't
want
anyone
to
know
it.
i'm
sure,
he
must
have
been
under
some
strain
to
recollect
what
was
going
on
and
i'm
sure
he
must
have
had
to
relay
on
it
and
that
this
strain
could
have
helped
his
motive
to
--
to
had
full
of
supply
but
be
mistaken
and
--
and
he
would
have
--
in
that
case,
the
mistakes
would
be
to
our
detriment.
again,
one
further
point
with
reference
to
the
lopez
dissent,
colson's
character
was
never,
and
as
i
said,
put
an
issue
because
he
never
testified
and
--
and
there
was
a
big
difference
between
colson,
a
convicted
convict,
and
a
man
who
sort
of
lived
by
the
gun.
and
massiah,
who
was
a
sailor,
never
charged
or
--
or
arrested
at
the
end
of
his
life
and
never
in
trouble
working
as
a
--
as
a
seaman
on
his
ship.
i
--
i
submit
that
this
--
this
was
a
very
important
fact
by
colson
not
being
on
the
stand.
if
massiah
was
to
be
accused,
he
should
be
confronted
with
his
accuser,
not
someone
standing
about
a
--
half
a
block
away
and
listening
to
it.
with
reference
to
--
oh,
with
reference
to
the
persuasion
aspect
of
it,
sometimes
its
argued
by
my
adversary
that,
well,
coercion
while
i
pointed
out,
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
any
coercion
in
the
situation
because
on
lee
was
--
didn't
--
i
mean
because
colson
didn't
testify
and
we
cannot
go
by
--
by
murphy's
testimony.
and
--
and
the
fact
that
this
was
done
in
a
stealthy
manner
also
brings
to
mind
that
john
gay,
which
was
quoted
by,
i
think
the
chief
justice
that
“an
open
foe
may
prove
a
curse
but
a
pretended
friend
is
worse.”
and
that's
what
mr.
jesse
colson
was,
a
pretended
friend
in
this
situation.
further
points
and
with
reference
to
the
law
on
this
case,
are
the
fourth
amendment.
these
are
not
as
strong
as
the
others
i
would
say
but
i
believe
they
are
in
the
spirit
of
the
other
objections.
now,
the
fourth
amendment,
the
illegal
search
and
seizures,
i
believe,
the
lopez
dissent
by
mr.
justice
brennan
eloquently
places
this
in
focus
and
states
how
the
--
the
government
can
obtain
one
way
the
--
this
evidence
in
violation
of
the
person's
constitutional
rights.
i've
pointed
out
that
--
suppose
in
this
situation
that
massiah
and
colson
had
--
had
--
of
claiming
their
defense
or
claim
defense
had
--
had
stated
our
whole
defense
in
the
case.
well,
the
government
would
in
that
--
in
that
event
probably
never
used
the
tape.
they
could
put
the
tape
in
a
drawer.
they
would
know
my
whole
case.
they
wouldn't
have
to
come
into
my
office
and
--
and
steal
my
records
but
they're
doing
in
a
more
subtle
and
sophisticated
way
what
they
--
what
they
cannot
do
by
virtue
of
the
--
the
words
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
is
related
to
the
fifth
amendment
as
--
as
justice
black
has
--
as
mr.
justice
black
has
stated.
with
the
right
of
privacy,
our
argument,
the
olmstead
case,
justice
brandeis'
opinion
i
think
sets
forth
the
law
on
the
right
of
privacy
and
eloquently
describes
it
better
than
i
can.
i
--
i
used
the
right
of
privacy
in
--
in
a
large
portions
of
the
--
of
the
brandeis
decision
in
my
brief
before
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
but
i
believe
just
mention
of
it
would
be
sufficient
in
this
case.
my
adversary
states
on
that
there
was
no
invasion,
intrusion
or
trespass
on
--
on
the
right
of
privacy
of
winston
massiah.
i
submit
that
he
chose
the
words
and
i
submit
that
there
was.
and
he
uses
these
verbs
"invasion,
intrusion
and
trespass"
and
the
origin
of
these
words
are
generally
latin
in
body
to
go
into,
intruderate,
to
thrust
into,
trespass,
transpass,
to
cross
over,
cross
of
boundary.
now,
i
say
the
government
went
into
the
car.
the
--
the
government
argues
in
their
brief
they
had
every
right
to
be
there.
but
if
they
had
every
right
to
be
there,
so
the
massiah's
counsel
has
every
right
to
be
there.
but
massiah's
counsel,
they
knew
who
massiah's
counsel
was
and
--
and
they
never
chose
to
notify
in
such
a
situation.
in
addition,
the
--
they
never
denied,
never
under
any
circumstance,
that
colson
was
a
government
agent
acting
in
the
employ
of
the
government
so
the
principle
of
qui
facit
per
alium
facit
per
se
is
employer
--
employable
and
that
he
--
that
he
was
acting
in
furtherance
of
his
master's
business.
intrusion,
thrust
into,
they
thrust
that
recorder
under
the
seat
of
the
--
of
colson's
car.
i
point
that
this,
we,
as
human
beings,
have
--
have
a
problem.
what
should
we
do
when
we
speak
on
the
telephone?
we
know
that
our
wires
could
be
tapped
but
when
--
when
we
go
into
someone's
car,
do
we
have
to
rip
open
it
--
open
the
front
seat
and
look
under
to
see
if
there's
a
transmitter?
or
do
we
have
some
privacy
in
our
life?
they
trespass,
transpass
to
cross
over.
they
crossed
over
our
boundary.
they
crossed
over
the
boundary
of
this
man's
intangible
but
his
rights
--
his
rights,
as
you
might
say,
are
privacy.
these
rights
are
as
intangible
as
my
right
to
good
reputation.
where
is
the
border?
you
can't
find
out
where
the
border.
it's
an
intangible
thing
but
it's
a
trespass
on
my
person.
and
when
someone
does
such
a
thing,
we
have
illegal
remedies
for
it.
with
reference
to
the
freedom
of
speech,
well,
as
i
pointed
out
that
we
would
be
seriously
afraid
to
express
ourselves
if
we
had
these
recordings
fall
over
where
they
would
be
taking
our
conversations
down
and
using
willy-nilly,
often
the
argument
is
made.
well,
if
you're
not
talking
evil,
why
--
what
do
you
care
whether
your
conversation
is
being
taped
by
the
government?
well,
suffice
it
to
say,
i
care
and
suffice
it
to
say,
i
think
the
judges
care.
the
point
being
this,
that
there
are
many
conversations
that
may
not
be
evil.
however,
these
conversations
are
confidential.
the
conversations
that
the
judges
--
that
the
judges
have
between
yourselves
now.
these
are
confidential.
they're
not
evil
but
you
would
like
them
private.
your
conversations
in
chambers,
a
conversation
that
the
bench
might
have
with
the
bar
asking
them
to
hold
a
certain
item
confidentially.
many,
many
confidential
conversations
are
important.
if
we
seriously
restrict
the
--
seriously
restrict
the
right
of
free
speech
then
we
will
be
living
to
or
well
in
1984
and
the
telscreen
would
be
the
icon
of
the
future.
with
reference
to
the
summation
and
conclusion
of
what
all
this
point
say,
the
summation
and
conclusion
of
what
all
this
point
say
is
that
this
--
this
case
and
the
points
involved
are
really
a
question
of
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment,
as
i
think
justice
potter
stewart
used
the
term,
is
to
avoid
midnight
inquisitions.
this
wasn't
midnight
but
this
was
about
11
o'clock
in
the
street
in
harlem
where
the
--
the
defendant
didn't
have
his
counsel
present.
a
dispute
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
if
the
government
has
something
and
the
prosecutor
has
something
let
them
come
forward.
i
don't
have
to
come
forward
it
--
with
it.
so
the
fifth
amendment
says
you
don't
have
to
incriminate
yourself
vocally.
the
fourth
amendment
says
you
--
they
can't
take
your
records
from
your
desks
and
incriminate
you
with
your
records.
the
sixth
amendment
says
that
not
only
you
as
your
right
of
counsel
as
your
--
as
your
rights
in
self-incrimination
protected
and
stated
but
is
protected
by
your
right
of
counsel.
the
canon
9
is
a
--
is
a
structure
put
upon
the
--
the
attorney's
voluntarily
sue
that
they
will
obey
the
tenets
and
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment.
with
reference
rule
93,
i
pointed
that
again
the
fifth
amendment
deals
with
basic
fundamental
fairness
and
it's
a
fair
rule
and
i
think
that's
the
--
the
capsule
description
of
the
rule
93.
with
reference
to
the
right
of
privacy,
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
freedom
of
speech,
again,
this
spirit
prevails
and
the
spirit
that
the
government
having
something
to
accuse
us
of
will
come
forward
within.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i'll
try
to
deal
with
this
brief
--
i'll
try
to
deal
with
this
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
brief
as
possible
on
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
fine.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
fine,
thank
you
very
much.
with
reference
to
one
important
point
that
the
solicitor
general
has
made
about
the
agency
of
colson,
i
didn't
think
it
was
believed
by
the
defense
that
there
was
never
any
doubt
that
colson
was
a
government
agent.
i
submit
your
honor
to
page
26
of
their
own
brief
where
they
say
colson
was
acting
as
a
government
informant.
those
are
their
words.
they
don't
use
the
word
"agent".
however,
i
previous
briefs
and
previous
proceedings
in
the
case,
they
pointed
out
that
he
was
a
government
agent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
26,
at
the
--
in
the
last
paragraph,
commencing
with
the
sentence
"at
the
time
colson
talked
with
the
petitioner
in
--
in
his
automobile.
both
petitioner
and
colson
were
under
indictment
and
colson
was
acting
as
a
government
informant."
so,
i'm
sure
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
i
--
i
recalled
in
the
--
the
first
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
the
first
question
i
asked
murphy
on
--
on
the
stand
was,
"was
he
cooperating
with
you?"
and
he
said,
"yes".
and
finbarr
murphy
testified
as
to
great
cooperation
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
part
of
colson.
and
i
--
i
can't
recall
now
but
i
think
in
their
brief
down
below
in
the
--
in
the
circuit
court,
they
made
a
great
point
of
the
fact
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
government.
i
will
add
one
other
point
that
was
closed
to
coming
to
--
to
that
was
that
on
page
33
in
about
three
quarters
down
the
page,
another
sentence,
"here,
just
as
during
investigation
prior
to
indictment
they
say,
the
government
agents
were
seeking
evidence
not
only
as
to
the
suspect."
and
this
again
--
i
don't
know
what
they
were
referring
to
if
they
weren't
referring
to
colson
as
the
government
agent
here.
and
the
big
distinctions
here
are
the
--
are
the
magic
words
of
"prior
to
indictment".
this
was
not
prior
to
indictment.
as
your
honors
know,
it
was
post-indictment.
with
reference
to
the
volunta
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
i
think
justice
potter
stewart
pointed
out
some
terms.
for
instance,
he
--
he
said,
"if
they
kept
colson
under
surveillance,
i
don't
see
any
objection
to
that.if
they
--
if
they
watched
them
right
now,
i
don't
see
any
objection
to
it."
however,
on
the
point
of
dealing
with
him
directly
by
speaking
with
them
with
their
--
their
informant
or
agent,
i
--
i
submit
that
this
is
under
the
--
the
line
of
cases
that
the
court
has
stated,
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceeding.
and
whenever
they
are
dealing
with
him,
they
--
they
are
dealing
with
him
in
this
critical
stage.
however,
i
think
sometimes
the
argument
is
made
until
they
all
--
does
the
defendant
have
to
have
his
lawyer
present
for
everything?
does
he
have
to
have
his
lawyer
present
if
the
government
asks
him
if
he
wants
a
glass
of
water
or
something
like
that?
i
would
say
no.
it
would
be
not
only
impractical,
impractical
but
impossible.
it
would
be
important
when
they
are
going
after
him
to
question
him
about
the
case
and
when
they
are
taking
evidence
from
them
with
the
expressed
purpose.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
never,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
no,
it's
not
before
the
court.
i
wish
to
mention
that.
i
--
and
i
feel
that
it
would
be
almost
improper
to
have
it
before
the
court
because
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
would
say
--
i
--
i
would
say
he
wouldn't
--
he
shouldn't
take
the
story.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
he
should
not.
for
the
very
same
reason
that
the
point
was
brought
up
before
whether
i
would
use
colson
to
testify.
colson
was
represented
by
a
counsel,
one
e.
k.
jones,
a
very
--
a
stood
lawyer
in
new
york.
i
never
spoke
with
colson.
i
never
knew
how
he
was
going
to
testify.
i
could
not
approach
colson
without
his
attorney
being
present.
so
with
reference
to
that,
i
think
because
the
man
has
an
attorney,
the
--
the
attorney
should
be
present.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
i
feel
with
reference
to
the
--
i
don't
have
wish
to
withhold
the
truth
in
any
manner.
but
with
reference
to
reading
the
transcript,
i
think
it
might
lead
to
collateral
issues
in
view
of
the
fact
that
justice
skelly
wright
pointed
out
that
the
transcript
was
not
evidentiary
and
would
not
be
introduced
in
evidence.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
think
it
would
bring
in
a
big
issue.
and
i
think
there
would
be
many
other
issues
in
it.
i
saw
it
from,
as
i
said,
many
confidential
communications
with
regard
to
same.
i
would
submit
not,
and
i
hope
it's
not
interpreted
that
i
wish
to
cover
any
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
evidence
or
anything
but
i
think
it
would
lead
to
collateral
problems
and
that
--
and
that's
my
feeling
on
it.
but
i'm
not
binding
this
court.
this
--
this
is
my
feeling
on
--
on
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
feel
there's
no
difference.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
that
would
have
a
bearing,
your
honor.
and
one
other
thing
which
i
just
thought
of
with
reference
to
your
question,
i
only
heard
the
transcript
once
as
i've
said.
i
only
heard
the
record
once.
i
don't
know
whether
the
tape
was
tampered
with,
whether
it
was
cut,
whether
it
was
edited,
whether
it
--
whether
the
--
the
transcript
to
which
was
a
stenographically
part
of
the
tape,
what
some
stenographer
thought
of
the
tape
is
--
is
valid
or
accurate
at
all
because
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
i
don't
know
if
they
knew
the
--
the
voices
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
okay.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honors,
i
will
try
to
keep
to
my
other
points
as
quickly
as
possible.
with
reference
to
the
voluntary
statements,
robinson,
the
case
that
was
cited
in
a
lower
new
york
case
was
affirmed
in
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
recently
and
that
was
a
--
affirmed
30
new
york
2nd
296.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
voluntary
unsolicited
statement.
there
was
no
coercion
in
the
case.
in
the
case
of
meyer,
which
the
chief
justice
mentioned
in
his
--
in
the
dissent
on
lopez,
in
the
footnote
of
the
chief
justice
states
that
meyer
was
out
on
bail.
he
was
not
incarcerated
and
not
in
custody.
and
i
submit,
again,
voluntary
unsolicited
statements.
the
question
of
coercion
was
--
was
pointed
out
but
the
question
of
circumventing
the
right
to
counsel
was
the
determining
point.
bram,
bullock
and
white
are
the
same
way.
with
reference
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
fine.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
fine,
your
honor,
i
--
i
appreciate
your
intellectual
curiosity
with
reference
to
it
and
--
and
i
appreciate
that
--
that
it's
a
very
important
matter.
but
your
honor,
my
point
that
i
made
was,
this
transcript
that
they
have
produced,
we
have
never
gone
through
it
before
court.
you
--
you
see
my
point.
i
don't
know
if
the
voices
were
accurately
represented
in
--
in
the
situation.
if
it
were
a
document,
your
honor,
that
i
have
seen
and
--
and
maybe
saw
his
handwriting
could
be
another
thing.
they
say
it
was
three
hour
or
two
hour
transaction.
with
reference
to
the
--
one
further
point
i
think,
the
chief
justice
is
--
has
made
a
good
point
with
reference
to
white
versus
maryland
and
bram
and
bullock
were
also
voluntary
unsolicited
statements
so
there
was
no
coercion
issue
there.
the
chief
--
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
the
reasons
in
the
lopez
case,
why
the
introduction
of
the
--
of
mr.
colson's
testimony
would
be
not
only
dangerous
but
unnecessary.
i
think
the
basic
point
there
would
be
--
it
would
--
the
defendants
--
from
the
defendant's
view
point,
the
--
the
problem
there,
your
honor,
would
be
--
it
would
shifti
think
basically
the
burden
of
presentation
and
would
make
it
inquisitorial
rather
than
accusatorial.
and
the
point
where
that
was
made
about
the
defendant
being
or
the
--
the
colson
being
dead
was
brought
up
at
--
at
the
trial.
i
said
he
is
not
dead.
and
the
point
would
be
this,
that
even
if
he
were
dead,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
reason
to
bring
this
secondary
unreliable
evidence.
we
all
have
difficulties,
lawyers,
trying
cases
always
have
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
why
do
i
call
it
unreliable?
for
the
reasons
based
--
based
in
--
that
i
have
stated
about
the
inability
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
the
witness'
inability
to
explain
the
circumstances,
inability
to
find
out
what
the
coercion
or
whether
there
was
any
coercion
practiced
upon
the
defendant.
and
in
addition,
the
--
the
question
of
--
of
any
force
or
effect
that
was
put
upon.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
all
recorded
on
the
machine.
we
don't
know
if
that
was
the
whole
conversation.
even
the
solicitor
general
said
that
there
was
a
preface
to
it
that
was
--
was
not
taken
up
in
the
conversation
and
this
would
be
important.
the
whole
conversations
would
be
important
and
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
use
improper
word.
i
think
the
primary
evidence
might
be
a
better
reason
that
a
choice
of
words
than
a
secondary
evidence
in
the
case.
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
yes,
i
would
say
it
was
secondary,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
the
defendant
massiah.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
i
--
maybe
i
could
make
the
--
the
proper
analogy
but
it
only
means
to
go
too
far
is
this.
in
a
civil
case,
if
the
man
was
dead
and
i
wanted
to
bring
in
certain
evidence
in
a
civil
case,
i
will
have
to
do
it
generally
by
deposition
before
time.
i
couldn't
bring
in
his
tape
recording
in
such
a
civil
case
and
the
reason
for
the
deposition
would
be
almost
three-fold.
one,
it
would
be
sworn.
two,
it
would
be
cross-examined.
and
three,
his
right
of
counsel
would
be
there.
and
if
that's
so
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
i
said,
it
shouldn't
be
an
exception,
i
--
i
say.
if
were
--
if
were
the
same
that
the
man
would
be
dead
in
the
civil
case,
why
should
it
be
so
different
in
a
civil
--
in
a
criminal
case?
and
the
point
would
be,
your
honor,
if
my
witness
--
my
important
witness,
suppose
i
had
a
very
important
witness,
and
he
were
dead,
could
i
use
a
tape
recording
of
his
conversation?
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
your
honor,
i
understand
that
this
--
your
reasoning
here
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
right
of
counsel.
is
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
now,
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
--
putting
right
of
counsel
aside.
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
and
there
maybe
many
defects,
your
honor,
as
--
as
you
will
know
that
the
electronic
--
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
j.
carluccio
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
fine,
i
--
the
--
the
only
point
that
i
might
make
was
that
the
government
has
said
that
to
strictly
in
deceit
maybe
used,
although
i
may
say
that
also
stamina
and
honesty
maybe
used
and
i
think
the
end
never
justifies
the
means.
thank
you
very
much.
