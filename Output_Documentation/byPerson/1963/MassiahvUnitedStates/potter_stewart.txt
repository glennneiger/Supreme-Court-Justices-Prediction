justice

stewart
was
colson
a
fellow
crew
member
of
massiah?
justice
potter
stewart
the
smuggling
had
allegedly
taken
place
when
they
were
both
members
of
the
crew
of
the
santa
maria
back
in
1958?
justice
potter
stewart
both
were
members
of
the
crew
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indications
that
the
united
states
attorney
or
anybody
on
his
staff
knew
about
this
electronic
surveillance
by
finbarr
murphy?
justice
potter
stewart
murphy
was
a
treasury
department
agent
or
what
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
automobile
ride
and
conversation
was
all
of
the
instigation
of
colson,
was
it?
does
the
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
show
that?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
sitting
in
the
car,
parked?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
car
wasn't
riding
around,
roaming
around?
justice
potter
stewart
sitting
in
the
automobile,
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
how
long
the
period
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
us
again
who
aiken
was?
justice
potter
stewart
was
aiken
tried?
justice
potter
stewart
aiken
doesn't
seem
to
be
named
as
a
co-defendant
in
this
last
indictment
on
page
26.
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
it
john
doe?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
turned
out
to
be
aiken?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
colson.
justice
potter
stewart
presumably
the
--
there
was
no
recording
made
of
this,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
assuming
that
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
not
--
that
was
not
admitted?
justice
potter
stewart
you
objected
to
it,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
had
that
been
admitted?
that
presumably
would
have
shown
the
--
the
ones
as
of
tone
of
voice
and
whether
something
was
said
in
a
jocular
way
or
in
a
serious
way,
it's
awkward,
isn't
not?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
better
than
somebody
else's
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
better
than
--
than
the
agent's
testimony
would
have.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
murphy
did
hear
this
simultaneously
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
--
his
--
his
knowledge
of
it
wasn't
--
didn't
come
from
the
tape,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
time
it
was
an
actual
simultaneous
broadcast
to
murphy,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
an
effort
by
the
prosecution
to
introduce
the
tape
and
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
objected
to
him
on
what
grounds?
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
tape
the
--
your
objection
was
sustained
and
the
--
and
the
tape
was
excluded
from
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
offer
made
before
or
after
murphy
had
testified?
do
you
remember?
justice
potter
stewart
the
very
next
day,
was
it
not
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
a
different
branch
in
the
case
and
perhaps,
i
will
not
go
onto
discuss
it
now
and
i'm
sure
you
are
going
to
discuss
it
later
but
don't
you
think
the
time
which
this
was
done,
it
was
some
relevance
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
had
been
indicted.
justice
potter
stewart
you
argue
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
generally
is
the
philosophy
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
adapted
as
well?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
--
justice
potter
stewart
judge
hayes,
of
course,
as
i
understood
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
dissenting
opinions
about
this
was
worst
than
official
interrogation
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
didn't
realize
he
is
being
interrogated
by
a
government
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
just
was
not
his
guard
at
all,
with
or
without
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
that
an
indictment,
generally,
is
followed
by
a
trial
in
a
courtroom.
justice
potter
stewart
before
an
indictment,
generally,
there
is
an
investigative
process.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
that
follows,
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
would
think
that
one
could
concede
the
complete
propriety
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
law
--
from
the
law
enforcement
point
of
view
making
further
investigations
of
this
alleged
narcotics
ring
through
the
surveillance
of
--
of
this
--
of
this
petitioner
massiah.
complete
propriety
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
insofar
as
--
insofar
as
leading
it
to
other
people,
to
the
big
man
as
you
call.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
far
--
maybe
as
you
--
so
far
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
i
know
for
the
using
the
informer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
conversations
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
leads
and
everything
else
but
you
have
a
separate
and
distinct
problem
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
the
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
use
of
this
against
massiah
at
his
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
proper
for
the
purpose
that
you
have
indicated.
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
motivation
--
if
the
motivation
is
to
find
other
people
and
to
investigate
further
this
--
this
plot
and
this
conspiracy
in
this
narcotics
business
and
to
lead
you
to
other
people,
it
might
be
quite
proper
for
that
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
schoolboy?
justice
potter
stewart
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
not
massiah?
