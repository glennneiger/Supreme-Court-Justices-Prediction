mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
has
been
troublesome,
worrisome
from
the
standpoint
of
the
government,
no
less
than
i
suspected
maybe
the
standpoint
of
the
court.
it's
also
a
case
in
which
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
essential
to
be
very
exact
and
precise
both
about
the
facts,
especially
those
which
distinguish
it
from
loosely
similar
situations
and
about
the
doctrines
with
which
we
are
concerned
because
while
these
general
principles
that
are
invoked
or
of
inestimable
importance
to
human
liberty,
it
is
also
true
that
some
of
the
practices
involved
are
indispensable
to
the
investigation
of
organized
crime
and
it
behooves,
therefore,
i
think
to
use
very
exact
and
precise
and
so
far
as
possible
dispassionate
weapons.
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
three
questions
involved.
the
first
concerns
the
use
of
the
schmidt
transmitter
and
receiver
and
the
recorder.
we
urge
that
where
the
truth
of
conflicting
accounts
of
a
voluntary
conversation
maybe
an
issue.
the
use
of
a
recorder
or
a
transmitter
and
receiver
to
verify
the
conversation
with
the
permission
of
one
party
and
without
any
form
of
trespass
is
a
lawful
method
of
getting
at
the
truth.
and
that
introduction
of
the
fruits
of
their
use
in
evidence,
not
only
violates
the
right
of
the
defendant
but
on
the
contrary,
it
helps
to
advance
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
trial
which
is
to
bring
out
the
truth
of
the
charges
and
have
been
a
conflicting
testimony
on
one
side
or
the
other.
the
second
question
here
concerns
the
absence
of
colson.
i
say
"absence",
i
should
have
said
more
accurately
the
unavailability
of
colson's
testimony
because
he
was
not
absent.
we
submit
that
his
unavailability
does
not
render
murphy's
testimony
inadmissible.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
refused
to
--
he
--
he
was
present
or
had
been
--
he
was
present
at
the
start
of
the
first
trial.
he
was
present
and
pleaded
guilty
at
the
start
of
the
second
trial
but
he
refused
to
testify.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
the
second
trial.
on
the
first
trial,
he
had
pleaded
not
guilty.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
called
as
a
witness.
he
--
shortly
after
he
was
called
and
before
he
said
anything
useful,
he
put
on
--
i
don't
mean
put
on
the
sense
of
act,
it
was
an
unfortunate
word.
there
was
a
scene
in
which
he
expressed
terror
and
refused
to
go
on
and
testify,
spoke
of
threats,
so
much
so
that
the
judge
at
the
request
of
the
other
defendants
declared
a
mistrial.
then
at
the
start
of
the
second
trial
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
a
very
soon
thereafter.
the
start
of
the
second
trial,
he
came
in
and
pleaded
guilty.
and
again,
he
explained
that
he
wouldn't
testify
that
he'd
been
threatened.
judge
skelly
wright
who
presided
here
sought
to
separate
out
whether
the
threats
induced
his
plea
of
guilty
and
upon
being
satisfied
that
they
did
not,
he
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty
and
later,
colson
was
sentenced.
it's
his
unwillingness
to
testify
that
i
referred
to
when
i
spoke
of
the
unavailability
of
his
testimony
or
whether
it
could
have
been
received
buying
a
--
sanctions
enough,
i
doubt
it
but
he
was
not
pressed
farther
then
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
is
being
satisfied
that
he
was
in
fear.
and
the
question
comes
up,
which
is
perhaps
somewhat
closer
than
the
first
question
i
raised,
whether
his
unavailability
makes
the
evidence
given
by
murphy
concerning
what
he
overheard
inadmissible.
but
then
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i
didn't
--
it
was
an
intimation
that
it
was
fear
from
people
interested
in
the
defense
but
so
far
as
massiah
goes
personally,
all
i
was
seeking
to
emphasize
whether
it's
--
this
was
not
a
case
of
our
concealing
in,
not
a
case
of
--
or
not
disclosing
his
identify
and
tend
to
argue
each
of
these
points.
i'm
just
trying
to
state
them
now.
but
one
of
his
testimony,
being
unavailable,
i
would
say
almost
as
if
he
was
dead
so
that's
something
almost
as
if
he
was
dead.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
such
claim
on
our
part.
it
simply
that
we
couldn't,
by
the
normal
means,
get
his
testimony.
that
--
that
is
only
fact
that
i
was
seeking
to
bring
out.
now,
as
i
say,
there
is
the
third
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
when
i
reach
that
part
in
my
argument
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
--
i
will
discuss
it
and
will
try
and
discuss
both
sides
but
our
conclusion
is
that
if
--
that
this
is
evidence,
i
wouldn't
characterize
it
as
secondary
evidence,
that
this
evidence
is
admissible.
the
third
point
which
needs
to
be
considered
and
which
introduces,
in
my
judgment,
the
both
source
for
misgivings
about
the
case
is
that
this
happened
after
massiah
had
been
indicted
while
this
has
been
said,
he
had
counsel.
we
urge,
nevertheless,
and
with
misgivings
that
i
shall
try
to
state
practically,
that
when
one
examines
it
closely
that
this
is
very
different
from
the
new
york
cases
and
the
cases
cited
by
counsel,
and
that
the
court
below
was
right
in
its
decision.
first,
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
way
the
case
stands
unprecedent.
the
facts
of
on
lee
are
indistinguishable
in
any
manner
favorable
to
the
petitioner
from
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
indeed,
the
differences
between
the
two
make
this
case
a
stronger
case
for
affirmance
than
on
lee.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
one
could
disagree
with
on
lee
and
still
vote
for
affirmance
in
the
present
case.
in
on
lee,
a
government
--
mr.
archibald
cox
on
lee
was
under
indictment,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
--
i
think
there
was
an
information.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
the
record
will
also
show
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
did
not
appear
in
the
opinion.
it
appears
in
the
record.
and
i
think
also
i
don't
know
and
while
i
don't
mean
to
minimize
the
point,
i
really
think
the
reason
the
point
wasn't
considered
was
that
no
one
would
have
thought
the
point
was
meritorious
at
that
time
but
that
speculation
on
my
part.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
out
on
bail.
the
--
in
on
lee,
the
testimony
was
given
by
a
government
agent
who
overheard
a
conversation
between
the
defendant
and
the
informer
who
was
carrying
the
radio
transmitter
that
enabled
the
agent
to
overhear.
those
are
the
facts
here.
in
on
lee,
he
was
out
on
bail
pending
trial
and
so
was
massiah
so
those
facts
are
the
same
here.
again,
as
i
say
the
record
shows
that
on
lee
has
a
lawyer
but
no
attention
was
directed
to
that
in
the
opinion
and
to
--
to
the
extent
that
that
is
significant.
there
is
a
possible
ground
for
distinction
in
the
way
the
court
treated
it,
although
not
on
the
fact.
now,
there
are,
in
addition,
two
differences,
which
i
submit
make
this
an
easier
case
for
affirmance
than
on
lee.
in
the
first
place,
the
conversation
took
place
there
in
on
lee's
store.
there
was
room
for
an
argument
that
the
informer
carrying
the
transmitter
was
trespassing
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
come
in
with
the
transmitter
and
that
you
will
recall
is
the
ground
that
mr.
justice
burton
joined
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
urged
in
defense.
there's
no
conceivable
basis
for
any
such
argument
here.
this
conversation
took
place
in
colson's
car,
the
informer's
car,
on
a
public
street.
colson
had
agreed
that
both
the
recorder
and
the
transmitter
might
be
installed
in
the
car
and
indeed,
the
car
had
been
used
and
continued
or
had
been
used
for
sometime
in
carrying
on
the
investigation
in
this
case.
this
was
not
just
one
conversation
or
even
a
conversation
with
just
one
man.
this
particular
one
was
with
one
man
but
there
had
been
other
conversation.
this
was
a
car
that
eventually
been
turned
over
to
the
government
by
colson
for
use
in
carrying
on
the
investigation.
so
on
that
ground,
on
lee
is
certainly
distinguishable
in
a
manner
favorable
to
us.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
that
follows.
i
think
that
--
what
we
are
entitled
to
assume
is
that
colson
conceded
and
therefore,
there
was
no
trespass.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i'm
meant
in
the
sense
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
meant,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
sense
that
he
was
--
he
was
using
and
allowing
the
government
to
use
his
car
in
pursuing
this
investigation.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
whether
he
was,
in
saying
that,
i
--
i
think
we
do
have
to
consider
whether
colson
was
an
agent
of
the
government
but
the
fact
that
he
allowed
the
car
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
carrying
on
the
conversation
does
not
seem
to
me
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
to
the
government.
that
was
--
whether
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
to
the
government,
it
seems
to
me
to
become
important
when
one
comes
to
this
question
which
i
shall
discuss
last
of
the
effect
of
the
fact
that
this
conversation
took
place
after
indictment
while
massiah
was
out
on
bail.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
i
think
also
an
informer.
he
may
have
been
--
he
was
a
paid
informer
i
guess
whereas
not
here,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
don't
have
any
paid
--
mr.
archibald
cox
other
than
his
hope
which
he
--
that
he
might
receive
is
somewhat
lighter
sentence
from
the
judge.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
the
word
suggested
in
the
opinion
that
he
was
but
i
maybe
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
it
with
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
take
it
that
means
that
he
have
been
used
on
a
continuing
basis
on
a
--
on
numerous
occasions.
the
other
difference
that
i
wanted
to
stress,
that
is
in
our
favor,
is
that
in
on
lee,
there
was
no
effort
to
produce
the
undercover
agent
chin
poy
and
his
whereabouts
were
not
disclosed
by
the
government.
here,
we
attempted
first
to
make
our
case
on
colson's
testimony.
it
was
to
our
desire
and
our
interest
to
have
colson
testify.
but
because
of
the
incidents
i've
mentioned,
it
was
concluded
that
that
testimony
was
not
--
not
available.
consequently,
except
for
some
possible
room
for
argument
introduced
by
the
point
of
our
counsel,
the
application
of
on
lee
to
this
case
clearly
would
call
for
affirmance.
second,
i
think
i
should
emphasize
in
speaking
about
the
established
precedent,
that
the
court
thus
far
has
always
refused
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment
unless
there
were
some
intrusion
into
the
premises
or
some
interference
with
the
person
or
has
involved
some
legal
compulsion
to
produce
documents.
thus
far
in
cases
in
this
general
area,
some
physical
intrusions,
some
physical
invasion
has
been
required.
now,
plainly,
there
was,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
no
physical
invasion
in
any
sense
of
any
premises
or
property
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
massiah
here.
even
if,
even
if
the
doctrine
of
the
fourth
amendment
were
extended
to
cover
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
was
involved
in
goldman,
still,
that
would
not
cover
this
case.
in
goldman,
you
will
recall
by
the
use
of
a
device
on
the
wall
of
the
room
unconsented
to
by
anyone,
for
anyone
inside
the
room
at
least.
the
government
might
be
said,
by
modern
scientific
devices,
to
have
intruded
its
senses
into
the
room
without
the
consent
of
the
people
who
have
the
processionary
or
property
interest
in
the
room.
again,
there
is
no
intrusion
of
that
kind
into
the
car
because
this
was
consented
to
by
the
informer.
so
i
think
that
under
established
doctrine,
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
violation
of
any
fourth
amendment
right
and
that
even
in
extension
of
those
rights
to
a
case
like
goldman
would
avail
this
petition
or
not.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don't
--
might
i
beg
your
honors'
indulgence
for
just
a
minute
more
because
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
assure
you
that
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
get
myself
and
therefore
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
perhaps
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
court
--
i
am
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
to
go
into
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
to
the
various
elements
of
the
--
in
the
government's
conduct
here
and
to
take
up
each
one
and
examine
it
in
sequence
and
one
of
those
questions
will
be
the
absence
of
colson.
but
i
do
think,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
that
it's
awfully
important
to
proceed
step
by
step
here
and
to
keep
our
minds
focused
on
exactly
what
is
involved
in
this
case
as
distinguished
from
some
other
case.
now,
the
heart
of
what
the
government
did
here,
the
core
of
the
investigation,
so
far
as
material
to
this
case,
was,
of
course,
the
use
of
the
informer
colson.
there
were
other
incidents,
questions
are
raised
about
them
but
that,
i
submit,
was
the
core
about
which
the
others
were
built.
no
one
contends
that
the
government
may
not
lawfully
use
informers
or
that
admissions
made
to
informers
should
not
be
received
in
evidence,
in
a
sense
the
use
of
informers
is
unquestionably
dirty
business
by
the
standards
which
we
seek
to
live
in
our
conduct
with
--
of
each
other
or
by
ordinary
polite
society.
smuggling
and
selling
narcotics
are
also
dirty
business.
they
are
carried
on
in
secrecy
involving
very
large
sums
of
money
and
the
conduct
of
those
investigations
are
--
to
violate
does
not
depend
exclusively
upon
informers,
it
does
depend
upon
some
method
of
piercing
the
secrecy
and
that
in
itself
nearly
always
involves
some
deception.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
blink
the
fact
but
it's
--
it
is
a
--
deception
is
a
--
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
crime,
surveillance
even
is
deception,
is
in
essential
way
of
getting
it
to
prove.
i
would
emphasize
that
this
was
an
investigation
into
big
time
narcotics.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
pathetic
figures
that
come
before
me
and
even
more
before
the
court
day
after
day.
the
tragic
little
pushers
or
users
convicted
of
possession,
this
was
a
major
conspiracy.
this
was
more
than
three
and
a
half
pounds
of
cocaine
and
that's
a
tremendous
amount
of
cocaine.
its
wholesale
value
would
be
about
$19,000.
its
retail
value
would
be
about
$250,000.
three
and
half
pounds,
i
am
told,
amounts
to
over
40,000
doses.
it's
--
now,
as
i
say,
admissions
made
to
informers
are
universally
admissible
in
evidence
and
i
think
we
can
take
that
as
a
premise.
i
take
it
that
we
may
also
accept
it
as
a
premise
here
that
an
admission
made
to
colson
overheard
by
murphy
because
he
was
secreted
in
the
trunk
of
this
car
or
under
the
backseat,
some
place
like
that
and
heard
it
with
his
own
ears,
would
unquestionably
be
admitted
in
evidence.
i
don't
know
any
ground
for
suggesting
the
contrary
and
i'm
quite
sure
there
are
no
cases
to
the
contrary.
so
i
then
come
taking
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
do
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
indeed.
i've
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
discuss
that
last.
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
in
this
case
i
won't
run
beyond
the
line
target.
i'm
going
--
i'd
like
to
go
through
it
step
by
step
because
quite
frankly,
if
the
court
reverse
it
here
the
ground
on
which
it
reverses
is
very
important
to
us,
that's
why
i
want
to
discuss
each
of
these
issues.
i
think
the
time
is,
from
our
standpoint,
i'll
be
very
candid,
the
weakest
element
in
the
case.
we
still
urge
affirmance
and
i
will
state
the
reasons
but
i
think
it's
the
weakest
element
in
our
case.
but
it
came
last
chronologically
and
i
would
like
to
stay
to
that.
i
do
come
now
to
the
use
of
the
recorder
and
the
schmidt
transmitter.
and
we
submit
that
their
use
neither
violated
any
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
nor
was
otherwise
unlawful
or
so
overreaching
or
overbearing
leaving
aside
the
element
that
justice
stewart
just
mentioned
as
to
call
for
suppression
of
the
evidence
received.
the
permissibility
of
making
a
record
that
will
verify
and
in
the
sense
of
being
more
complete
record
supplement,
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness
would
seem
to
be
firmly
established
by
the
decision
last
term
in
lopez.
no
one
has
a
right
of
privacy
or
another
legally
protected
interest
in
not
having
repeated
the
words
he
utters
to
another
person,
on
the
contrary,
is
subject
to
some
special
privilege
like
husband
and
wife
or
lawyer
and
client.
indeed,
i
supposed
it's
fair
to
say
that
given
some
indication
that
it's
pertinent
to
a
criminal
trial
or
a
civil
proceeding,
the
person
now
hears
the
word
has
a
legal
duty
to
testify
to
what
he
heard,
absent
this
kind
of
approval.
now,
what
the
recording
and
transmission
and
reception
with
the
consent
of
one
participant
do
is
simply
to
verify
the
oral
account.
it
breaches,
no,
there
is
no
breach
of
privacy
that
would
otherwise
be
inviolate
when
you
add
the
recording
or
the
use
of
the
transmitter
and
receiver,
where
one
of
the
parties
consents
and
is
prepared
to
repeat
what
he
heard.
i
think
we
should
distinguish
very
sharply
between
this
case
and
the
case
like
lopez
on
the
one
side
and
the
kind
of
electronic
eavesdropping
that
is
illustrated
by
goldman
and
perhaps
by
the
olmstead
case
on
the
other
side.
all
things,
electronic,
are
not
the
same.
and
there
some
be
a
--
a
distinction,
we
submit.
in
goldman,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
investigators
projected
their
senses
into
a
room
which
they
had
no
right
to
enter
and
the
entry
into
which
would
rather
plainly
have
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
arguably,
that
was
true
in
on
lee,
two
justices
took
that
position.
in
goldman,
and
certainly
in
olmstead,
there
was
another
form
of
intrusion.
the
federal
investigators
intruded
into
a
private
conversation
without
the
consent
of
any
participant.
it
was
--
they
had
no
consent.
there
was
no
one
there
who
was
going
to
repeat
it
but
they,
i
say
intruded,
they
thrust
themselves
in
from
the
outside
and
thus
destroyed
what,
otherwise,
would
have
been
a
private
conversation.
neither
of
those
elements
was
present
in
lopez
and
neither
is
present
here.
there
was
no
intrusion
into
a
private
place
or
property
of
the
defendant.
there
was
no
search
of
the
defendant.
there
was
no
legal
compulsion
to
make
any
statements
or
to
give
the
government
any
evidence
to
assume
therefore
that
olmstead
and
goldman
were
both
bad
law
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
gives
protection
against
electronic
intrusion
into
private
premises,
is
of
no
avail
to
this
petitioner
as
i
said
before.
nor
there
was
--
nor
was
there
any
unconsented
to
intrusion
into
the
conversation.
all
the
recording
did
was
to
get
the
most
reliable
evidence
of
a
conversation.
that
was
by
--
by
definition,
no
longer
private.
and
i
would
emphasize
that
this
distinction
between
lopez
and
the
present
case
on
the
one
side
and
cases
like
goldman
and
olmstead
on
the
other,
is
one
that
is
widely
recognized
by
the
commentators
in
this
field.
samuel
dash
and
his
co-authors
in
the
book
on
the
eavesdroppers
that
is
often
referred
to
and
probably
the
most
complete
study
of
this
subject
is
--
referring
to
his
previous
discussion
which
was
along
the
lines
that
i
have
fallen,
the
above
analysis
would
appear
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
eavesdropping,
and
he
means
electronic
eavesdropping,
violates
a
substantial
interest
of
the
defendant
only
where
it
is
not
consented
to
by
either
party
to
the
conversation
or
where
the
conversation
is
within
confidential
relationships.
edward
bennett
williams,
in
the
article
cited
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
lopez,
discusses
the
problem
and
he
too
reaches
the
conclusion
that
there's
no
greater
intrusion
into
privacy
that
is
of
legal
significance
in
using
a
transmitter
and
recorder
--
a
transmitter
and
receiver
or
recorder,
then
there
is
in
having
one
participant
to
the
conversation
related.
the
only
real
distinction
is
that
a
simultaneous
record
or
broadcast
is
more
complete
and
exact
than
any
subsequent
report.
this
is
a
distinction
in
degree
but
not
in
essence,
where
a
conversation
is
recorded
or
transmitted
without
the
consent
of
any
participant,
that's
not
our
case,
that's
goldman,
an
entirely
different
set
of
concepts
must
apply.
this
is
the
view
that
allan
westin
takes
in
his
article
on
wiretapping
and
bradley
and
hogan
in
an
article
in
the
georgetown
law
review.
it's
a
view
adapted
in
five
of
the
seven
states
statutes
that
have
legislated
on
the
subject
of
electronic
devices.
so
that
we
submit
that
it
has
respectable
authority
among
those
who
have
been
most
sensitive
to
this
problem
of
the
protection
of
privacy.
i
come
now
to
the
plight,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
significance
should
we
attribute
to
the
fact
that
colson
did
not
testify,
because
that
is
the
next
element
in
the
case
and
it's
one
as
we're
all
aware
that
you
directed
attention
to
in
your
separate
opinion
in
lopez?
i
would
like
to
suggest
the
first
that
this
question
of
whether
the
informer
must
be
present
and
testify,
is
purely
a
matter
of
the
materiality
and
reliability
of
the
evidence
and
perhaps,
in
some
cases,
of
fairness
in
allocating
the
duty
of
producing
witnesses.
what
i
mean
is
this,
there
--
it's
not
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
fourth
amendment
either
was
violated
or
not
violated
at
the
time
the
recording
was
made
in
the
simultaneous
transmission
and
reception
occurred.
and
if,
as
i
submit
i
have
shown
and
the
court
should
hold,
it
was
not
a
violation
then
causing
subsequent
failure
to
testify
can
hardly
make
it
a
violation.
equally,
there's
no
other
illegality
if
it
was
proper
when
done
that
would
call
for
some
kind
of
a
prophylactic
rule
which
would
prevent
the
use
of
the
evidence
in
order
to
prevent
the
conduct
because
the
conduct
was
proper.
we
face
it
as
a
problem
of
evidence
in
and
in
some
cases
it's
a
matter
of
fairness
in
allocating
the
right
of
calling
witnesses
and
putting
them
to
testify.
now,
by
all
normal
standards
of
the
law
of
evidence,
the
recording
or
the
agent's
report
of
what
he
heard
is
material
enough
and
reliable
enough
to
be
received
in
evidence.
any
disproof,
explanation
or
impeachments,
if
it's
a
live
witness,
are
for
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
by
all
normal
standards.
one
start,
i
suppose,
with
the
obvious
proposition
that
admissions
are
receivable
in
evidence.
obviously,
these
admissions
would
be
receivable
in
evidence
if
overheard
by
murphy
with
his
own
ears.
and
they
would
be
receivable
in
evidence
if
he
had
heard
only
what
he
testified
to
hear
and
couldn't
testify
to
any
other
part
of
the
conversation.
now,
i
suggest
that
his
testimony
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
--
he
is
entitled
to
know
all
the
witness
can
testify
to
but
i
suppose
that
--
let's
change
the
circumstances
a
little
bit.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
i'd
certainly
think
we've
got
to
decide
on
these
circumstances,
mr.
chief
justice.
sometimes
in
--
sometimes
analogy
helps
us
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
find
which
way
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
there
were
distinctions
to
be
drawn
in
this
area.
i
would
think
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
say
as
a
matter
of
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
that
the
government
is
never
under
an
obligation
to
produce
the
informer
who
took
part
in
the
investigation
and
to
set
the
trap.
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
think
it
was
an
equally
a
mistake
and
they
defeated
the
purpose
of
the
trial
if
we
treat
this
is
in
law
of
evidence,
it's
solely
a
matter
of
which
is
the
best
proof
and
the
fair
trial
to
lay
down
a
hard
and
fast
rule
the
other
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
i
--
i
do
think
of
few
analogies
will
help
though
i
don't
know
how
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
evade
your
question
about
the
particular
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
suppose,
for
example,
that
murphy
testified,
that
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
booth
in
a
bar
or
cabin
and
that
massiah
came
in
with
another
man
and
he
couldn't
hear
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
because
they
talked
in
a
low
voice
of
--
for
about
half
an
hour
they
talked
in
a
louder
voice
and
they
discussed
who
could
have
informed
on
them
and
how
this
cocaine
was
brought
in
and
so
forth
and
then
murphy
going
on
and
said,
"well,
i
couldn't
hear
anymore
because
massiah
said,
"for
goodness
sakes,
stop
yelling.
you're
telling
everybody
in
the
room
about
it."
and
murphy
said,
"well,
they
went
on,
they
stayed
there
another
two
hours."
i
think
and
i'm
right
in
saying
that
there'd
be
no
question
about
the
admissibility
of
murphy's
testimony
under
those
circumstances
as
to
any
admissions
he
overheard.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
take
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
working
for
the
government
at
the
time
introduced
such
a
probable
element
of
unreliability
as
to
make
it
imperative
under
all
circumstances
for
the
government
to
produce
the
informer,
no.
i
would
--
i
would
distinguish
according
to
a
number
of
circumstances
as
i
say.
i
think
this
ought
to
be
a
question
for
the
trial
judge
in
the
particular
case.
if
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wasn't
addressing
myself,
mr.
justice,
to
privacy
of
the
conversation
as
i
suggest
it
with
respect
to
that
before.
the
--
once
the
man
speaks
to
the
informer
to
another
person,
the
privacy
is
gone.
here,
i
was
trying
to
address
myself
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
about
the
unavailability
of
colson.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
some
cases,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
the
facts
were
these.
he
was
first
brought
in
by
the
government.
and
there
was
a
mistrial
the
first
time
he
was
brought
in
because
of
his
expostulations
and
refusal
to
testify
before
because
of
threats.
the
day
or
two
or
the
next
day
later,
he
was
brought
in
and
there
was
--
he
pleaded
guilty.
he
again
referred
to
the
threats
in
his
unwillingness
to
testify.
and
he
was
then
in
effect
excused.
now,
this
came
up
a
second
time
where
there
is
--
when
the
testimony
of
murphy
and
the
recording
were
offered
in
evidence.
the
second
time
the
defendants,
knowing
that
colson's
testimony
couldn't
be
received,
i
suspect,
did
demand
that
the
government
produced
him.
the
judge
cut
in.
there
came
to
be
a
--
somewhat
heated
exchange
between
counsel
about
whether
what
had
happened
earlier
was
stated
fairly.
the
judge
cut
in
and
said,
"none
of
that."
and
the
case
then
went
on
and
the
objection
was
overruled.
mr.
archibald
cox
neither
party
took
any
step
to
subpoena
him
during
the
second
trial.
his
whereabouts
were
certainly
known.
he
was
--
he
had
been
in
the
courtroom.
and
i
have
--
i
don't
know
but
i
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
every
reason
to
believe
he
was
in
custody.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
available
to
both
or
he
was
available
to
the
judge.
and
i
think
that
--
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
element.
i
was
going
on
to
suggest
in
discussing
this
point
in
the
discretion
that
is
vested
in
the
trial
judge
that
it
would
seem
to
me
an
entirely
reasonable,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
government
came
in
and
offered
a
tape
recording
carried
by
an
unnamed
informer
and
it
had
in
it
some
admissions
and
the
government
said,
"well,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
who
the
informer
is.
we're
not
going
to
produce
him.
we
want
simply
to
put
the
tape
in
evidence,"
which
seemed
to
me
entirely
reasonable
for
the
judge
to
say,
"the
least
you
could
do
is
disclose
who
that
man
is
and
if
you
have
any
continuing
contact
with
him,"
the
judge
might
go
on
and
say,
"you've
got
to
produce
him."
and
one
could
go
on
and
reason
from
there
as
to
whether
he
should
be
the
court's
witness,
the
government's
witness
or
the
defendant's
witness
and
distribute
the
rights
to
impeach
and
so
forth
from
that
point
according
to
particular
circumstance.
again
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
your
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
think
your
honor's
question
in
--
overlooks
the
counsel
and
the
judge
all
knew
that
colson
had
already
been
in
court
and
at
the
--
when
the
government
tried
to
get
him
to
testify
and
had
refused
to
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
is
the
fact
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
he's
--
at
the
very
time
he
pleaded
guilty,
he
stated
that
he
wouldn't
testify.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
--
i
must
confess,
mr.
justice,
that
it
--
it
would
seem
to
me
a
mistake
to
spend
out
too
much
from
the
exact
words
of
what
occurred
on
this
occasion.
judge
skelly
wright
is
a
highly
experienced
judge.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he's
a
notably
human
judge.
he
apparently
felt
that
this
man
--
the
government
didn't
really
want
to
force
him
to
testify,
it
was
not
necessary.
if
there
is
force
to
your
point,
it
would
seem
to
me
there
is
equally
force
to
the
answer
that
the
defendant
might
have
said,
"well,
bring
him
back
in
here
again.
i
want
to
see
if
he
won't
answer
my
questions."
but
he
didn't
do
that.
he
simply
objected
that
this
was
not
the
best
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
must
also
recall
--
we
must
also
recall
that
he
had
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
previously.
mr.
archibald
cox
before
he
pleaded
guilty.
and
there
may
be
a
legal
question
as
to
--
as
to
the
effect
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
grave
doubt
about
that.
mr.
colson
had
been
in
these
narcotics
ring
apparently
for
quite
a
while.
and
i
suspect
that
if
the
case
has
come
up,
he
would
have
had
a
very
considerable
argument
the
plea
of
guilty
to
this
crime.
we
had
a
case
somewhat
of
that
kind
a
few
years
ago.
i
forget
the
name.
it
came
from
the
first
circuit.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
were
not
successful.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
remember
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
we
are
criticized
for
doing
it
that
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
exact
logical
consistency
might
have
required
us
to
press
further
here.
i
would
have
thought
that
one
there
at
the
time
might
have
concluded
that
this
thing
to
do,
under
the
circumstances,
wasn't
to
press
colson
any
further.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
there's
anything
inconsistent.
i
don't
recall
anything
inconsistent
with
that,
justice
black.
no,
i
don't.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
could
have
called
himself
and
he
could
have
called
him
as
a
hostile
witness
and
i
think
he
could
have
argued
to
the
judge
that
he
shouldn't
be
bound
by
what
he
said
or
anything
else.
what
i
am
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
strange
that
he
should
want
to.
and
of
course,
the
fact
is
the
government
wanted
to
use
him
as
a
witness.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
can't
get
a
way
from
that,
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
wanted
to
use
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
a
witness.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
fact
--
i
--
i
quite
understand
with
your
point
in
general,
mr.
justice
clark.
in
this
case,
the
fact
which
i
can't
resist
blurting
out
is
that
we
want
him
to
testify.
there's
--
there's
no
--
no
question
about
that.
we
weren't
trying
to
conceal
him
or
conceal
his
whereabouts.
if
we
felt
his
testimony
was
available,
then
we
would
have
been
glad
to
have
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
where
--
we're
not
hiding
the
witness,
where
his
testimony
in
the
judgment
of
those
present
can't
be
obtained
to
--
that
this
is
very
much
as
if
the
witness
was
dead
into
exclude
what
is
undeniably
on
its
phase
reliably
and
probative
evidence,
where
it's
not
just
a
straight
bid
of
a
conversation
but
the
same
amount
is
of
detail
--
the
same
degree
of
detail
and
various
and
multitude
as
there
was
here,
something
which
is
checked
by
all
kinds
of
collateral
evidence
that
that
is
really
to
exclude
it
as
to
defeat
the
objective
of
the
trial
which
is
to
get
the
most
reliable
evidence.
now,
it's
also
significant
here
that
murphy
was
able
to
testify
to
a
good
many
of
the
circumstances.
and
of
course,
he
was
called.
this
isn't
the
matter
of
putting
on
only
the
recorder
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
my
understanding
is
that
it
was
a
complete
recording
of
everything
that
occurred
in
the
car.
but
i
would
like
--
i
must
have
in
fairness
qualifications.
as
i
read
it,
and
there's
a
transcript
filed
with
the
court,
i
am
somewhat
troubled
in
my
answer
by
the
fact
that
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
of
what
i
would
have
thought
would
have
been
the
preliminaries.
now,
maybe
the
preliminaries
had
been
as
these
men
walked
on
the
street
and
that's
why
it
began
somewhat
abruptly.
i'm
informed,
and
i
--
i
think
i
understand
it
right,
that
this
is
a
complete
recording
of
what
occurred
in
the
automobile.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
understood
from
his
account
that
he
had,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
had
been
played
to
him
and
i
--
i
don't
have
any
reasons.
supposed
it
wasn't
available
to
him,
i
think
it
ought
to
have
been
available
to
him.
but
i
can't
say
that
there
was
any
offer
made
to
him
then
the
whole
record
isn't
printed
so
i
can't
really
even
doubt
for
everything
that
maybe
in
the
transcript.
so
far
as
i
know,
it
was
fully
available
to
him.
now,
i
come
to
the
concluding
part
of
the
case.
the
question,
i
have
to
state
it
most
unfavorably
to
us,
is
whether
evidence
obtained
from
the
defendant
by
a
trick
of
an
informer
after
indictment
and
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
and
defendant
might
argue
also,
we
would
deny
it
for
the
purposes
of
convicting
massiah
should
be
excluded.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
first
that
this
is
clearly
not
a
problem
of
police
interrogation
in
the
usual
sense.
and
most
of
the
cases,
virtually
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited,
are
cases
of
police
interrogation
or
prosecutorial
interrogation
in
the
usual
sense.
this
plainly
isn't
spano.
it's
plainly
not
a
case
where
there
is
any
problem
of
physical
or
psychological
compulsion
or
the
threat
of
coercion.
there
are
no
risks
of
physical
coercion
involved
in
this
kind
of
practice.
and
indeed,
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all,
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody
and
he
was
not
in
custody
even
in
the
loose
and
in
the
accurate
sense
in
which
one
maybe
in
custody
when
he's
in
the
district
attorney's
office
being
questioned
even
though
he's
not
under
arrest.
he
was
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
chose.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
being
in
the
police
station
was
a
--
was
a
material
deference.
i
hesitate
to
answer
all
of
the
questions
that
--
i
may
also
say
on
the
authorities
such
evidence
would
plainly
be
admissible.
i
don't
know
with
one
possible
exception
in
the
lower
courts
in
new
york.
every
case
that
i
know
of
holds
that
they
are
admissible
and
we'd
to
more
so
indicate
it.
but
i
would
think
that
was
a
different
case
from
this
one.
here,
as
i
see
it,
the
central
question
is
whether
the
conversation
in
the
car
ought
to
be
treated
as
an
integral
part
of
the
progress
of
the
criminal
proceeding
so
that
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
become
involved
or
are
they
something
wholly
separate
from
the
criminal
proceeding
in
which
event
neither
of
those
rights
is
involved
to
where
there
is
no
compulsion
to
stay.
now,
i
suppose
the
arguments
for
treating
this
is
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding
really
come
down
to
two,
which
i
try
to
analyze
it
in
my
mind.
one
might
argue
that
after
indictment,
there's
a
shift
in
the
character
of
everything
that
goes
forward.
that
it
--
things
are
now
in
the
government's
mind
to
focus
on
the
defendant.
he
becomes
an
object
of
prosecution
and
not
just
of
general
inquiry
into
how
do
we
prevent
crime
or
who
can
catch
somebody
who
committed
a
crime.
and
it
might
therefore
--
could
therefore
be
argued
that
those
are
enough
to
make
the
relations
between
the
defendant
and
the
government
all
part
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
urging
reversal
but
i
am
trying
to
analyze
the
feeling
on
the
other
side.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
those
cases
are
distinguishable,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
is
one
case
in
the
lower
courts
of
new
york
that
the
petitioner
calls
attention
to
that
goes
beyond
that
but
i
would
think
that
was
not
in
keeping
with
anything
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
and
i
would
argue
for
the
reasons
i'm
about
to
state
here
that
it's
erroneous.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
can
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
think
--
may
i
come
to
that
in
--
again
in
just
a
moment.
i
really
will
come
to
it.
i
would
like
--
i
was
going
to
state
in
--
that
the
other
factor
i
suppose
that
enters
into
here
on
the
side
of
petitioner
is
that
somehow
our
sense
of
the
necessity
of
fairness
is
heightened
and
enhanced
after
the
man
has
been
indicted.
now,
for
the
arguments
against
that
view
and
for
admission
of
the
evidence,
in
the
first
place,
certainly
not
everything
is
the
defendant's
life
after
indictment
is
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding
against
him
where
he's
out
on
bail
and
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleases
even
though
it
uses
evidence
--
yields
evidence
against
him.
he's
not
in
custody.
there
is
no
official
pressure
to
answer
questions,
and
that,
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
center
of
the
view
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
again,
certainly,
indictment
does
not
put
an
end
to
the
need
to
carry
on
an
investigation
into
elicit
activities
in
narcotics
and
other
organized
crime.
it's
particularly
important
that
the
investigation
go
on
even
after
a
single
defendant
has
been
indicted.
here,
if
you
will
look
into
the
facts
and
if
one
had
all
the
facts,
it
would
be
even
clearer
but
the
big
catch
was
made
after
this
indictment
and
also
the
two
were
hardly
related.
it
was
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
final
segment
of
the
case,
the
question
whether
this
incident
in
the
car,
the
conversation
in
the
car
and
the
surrounding
circumstances
should
be
thought
of
as
part
of
the
proceedings
against
the
defendant
so
as
to
bring
in
and
apply
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
whether
they
should
be
thought
how
this
something
outside
and
separate
in
which
event
the
evidence
under
normal
rules
would
be
admissible.
i'd
stated
two
--
two
of
the
reasons
that
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
on
the
whole,
they
should
be
regarded
as
separate
and
the
evidence
should
be
admissible.
in
the
first
place,
we
emphasize
that
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody,
that
there
were
no
official
questioning,
no
pressure
of
any
kind
either
to
stay
there
or
to
engage
in
the
conversation
or
answer
questions
nor
could
it
be
said
in
any
sense
to
be
an
interrogation
by
an
expert
interrogator.
the
second
point
that
i
had
just
began
to
develop
was
that
the
return
of
an
indictment
against
one
member
of
what
maybe
a
conspiracy
in
the
case
of
organized
crime
doesn't
terminate
the
need
to
press
forward
the
investigation.
we're
not
dealing
here,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
this
in
mind,
where
the
single
crime
of
violence,
say
a
murder
at
a
filing
station,
bludgeoning
in
a
bar,
somebody
kills
his
wife
or
something
like
that,
that's
the
case
which
has
frequently
come
before
the
court
and
there
any
questioning
of
whether
under
--
in
the
police
station
or
otherwise
is
obviously
addressed
to
extracting
evidence.
that
is
not
typically
true
in
the
kind
of
case
that
we're
dealing
with.
there
is
the
rest
of
the
ring
to
be
uncovered.
indeed
here
aiken,
the
bake
man
was
identified
and
found
after
this
took
place.
frequently
the
defendant
himself,
while
allowed
to
on
bail,
resumes
or
continuous
his
criminal
activities.
i'm
not
saying
massiah
did,
i'm
simply
saying
that
frequently
is
done.
pursuing
the
investigation
in
the
manner
done
here,
in
other
words,
is
not
necessarily
or
even
primarily
focused
upon
obtaining
an
evidence
against
the
particular
defendant.
but
the
third
point
i
would
stress
is
that
the
return
of
an
indictment
or
if
you
will
the
date
of
arraignment
or
any
other
arbitrary
date
is
not
a
very
satisfactory
cutoff
point
in
which
to
say
admissions
before
that
are
admissible
and
the
admissions
afterwards
are
not.
if
a
cutoff
point
is
indispensable,
i
suppose
this
one
is
good
as
any.
but
it's
pretty
hard
really
to
distinguish
massiah's
situation
before
he
was
indicted
from
massiah's
situation
after
he
was
indicted.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
true.
but
take
this
particular
case
and
simply
is
an
illustration
here
anfield
(ph)
who
later
became
a
defendant
talked
in
the
car
with
colson
and
he
happen
to
talk
before
he
was
indicted.
i
--
i
think
that
there
was
about
as
much
evidence
against
anfield
(ph)
before
that
conversation
as
there
was
related.
and
--
well,
i
--
i
can't
deny
if
there
are
some
force
in
your
honors'
point.
indeed,
if
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
i
recognized
this
was
probably
as
good
as
any.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
results
in
some
arbitrary
distinctions.
and
that
it
has
the
further
unfortunate
point
--
fact
that
it
may
induce
the
prosecutor
to
withhold
indicting
when
he
otherwise
would
because
of
its
impact
on
evidence
and
while
sometimes,
that's
unavoidable.
i
don't
think
it's
a
particularly
desirable
thing.
i
think
that
comes
into
consideration.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
quite
sure
that
colson
didn't
ever
testify,
your
honor,
on
this
beyond
what
i've
already
referred
to,
the
effort
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
make
him
testify.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
sure
enough.
fourth,
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
far
from
clear
that
the
admissions
of
the
kind
made
here
can
be
distinguished
from
other
post-indictment
admissions
that
are
clearly
receivable
in
evidence.
indeed,
it's
interesting
that
the
petitioner
states
the
question,
our
defendant's
incriminating
statements
made
in
the
absence
of
his
retained
counsel
after
formal
--
after
the
formal
proceeding
has
been
initiated
by
his
arraignment
and
indictment
admissible
over
objection
in
a
federal
trial.
well,
certainly,
if
he
had
voluntarily
told
some
other
person,
his
wife
that
she
was
willing
--
what
she
might
have
been
his
brother.
if
he
had
been
willing
to
come
in
and
testify
or
another
informer,
not
one
acting
in
any
sense
for
the
government
at
the
time
but
one
who
later
determine
to
testify
for
the
government,
i
take
it
as
a
no
question
but
that
--
that
would
be
relevant,
admissible
and
reliable
subject
to
impeachment
testimony.
why
then
should
one
draw
a
distinction
where
he
happens
to
make
it
under
circumstances
where
the
informer
has
been
cooperating
with
the
government?
one
can
think
of
all
kinds
of
questions
agree
here
that
would
seem
to
render
this
inadmissible.
i
would
finally
add
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
just
want
to
add
a
few
more
points.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
acknowledge
that
my
case
is
a
little
harder
than
one
where
the
informer
comes
in
afterwards
and
says,
"well,
i
just
heard
something
good,"
won't
you
take
that
into
consideration
or
won't
the
judge
take
that
into
consideration
unless
to
my
sense.
it's
a
little
harder
because
here,
in
a
sense
he
was
talking
to
the
government.
there
was
a
transmitter
recorder.
i
doubt
that
that
should
matter
from
anything
overheard
in
any
other
fashion
on
this
point.
it's
a
little
different
too
because
the
agent
had
--
was
cooperating
with
the
government.
but
i
shouldn't
take
this
was
material
where
the
informer
is
simply
a
layman,
someone
who
is
inside
the
ring
and
he's
reporting
what
goes
on,
i
would
distinguish
it
very
sharply
from
a
case
of
where
the
prosecutor
himself
saying
in
some
kind
of
disguise,
was
drawing
out
the
defendant.
it
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
points
you
raised
before
the
recess,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
point
is
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
this
isn't
likely
to
be
or
fairly
thought
of
as
a
problem
of
the
expert
on
one
side
questioning
the
innocent
man
and
the
other
and
i
think
that's
another
difference
from
what
i
understand
to
be
the
true
theory
of
the
new
york
cases.
here,
this
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
might
develop
if
the
government
were
investigating
an
espionage
ring
and
somebody
had
been
infiltrated
into
the
ring
of
one
man
is
indicted
that
is
released
on
--
on
bail.
must
the
government
--
he
later
goes
back
to
attend
meetings
of
the
ring.
must
the
government
now
withdraw
its
counter
espionage
agent?
mr.
archibald
cox
and
through
reports
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
so
far
as
using
the
informer's
concerns.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
conversation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
just
want
to
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
our
conduct
is
proper,
then
the
only
question
left
is
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
since
it's
a
single
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
but
then,
isn't
what
we
must
do,
perhaps,
to
investigate
what
was
the
purpose?
in
other
words,
i
find
it
--
i
suppose
the
two
ways
we
might
meet
the
difficulty
your
honor
has
in
mind,
which
i
think
i
appreciate.
one
way
would
be
to
say,
when
we
have
--
that
it's
lawful
to
do
this
which
i
understand
you're
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
the
discussion.
the
other
way
i
think
might
be
to
make
an
inquiry
into
what
really
is
it
that
the
government
is
doing.
and
i
--
i
have
difficulty
with
the
first
view
that
you
were
suggesting
should
be
considered
because
if
you
--
if
the
government
is
doing
something
lawful
and
proper,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
universally
accepted
test
becomes
simply
is
this
reliable
evidence.
and
i
don't
think
that
i
need
to
argue
that
by
the
normal
standards,
this
is
reliable
probative
evidence
subject
to
such
exception.
and
i
think
the
other
way
of
coming
at
it
may
be
to
say,
like
all
of
these
lines,
it's
not
a
perfect
one,
but
maybe
to
say,
what
is
it
that
the
government
is
primarily
trying
to
do
if
it
is
gathering
evidence
against
this
man
if
that's
the
center
of
what
it
is
doing?
then
it
ought
to
be
treated
under
the
rule
of
the
new
york
cases,
whereas
if
the
government
is
proceeding
in
normal
fashion
to,
as
it
had
been
before,
to
carry
on
an
investigation,
then
if
this
testimony
falls
into
its
lap,
that
isn't
quite
a
fair
statement
because
it
obviously
knows
it
may
fall
into
its
lap.
but
if
this
testimony
comes
along,
then
it
should
be
admissible
like
any
other
testimony
that
comes
along.
now,
on
that
point,
i
do
want
to,
incomplete
candor,
to
call
the
attention
to
a
passage
in
the
record,
which
you
might
say
--
show
us
that
we
were
collecting
evidence.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
shows
that
and
i
won't
delay
to
read
it
but
you
should
read
in
r.
95
in
the
center
of
the
page,
r.
95
in
the
center
of
the
page,
if
this
point
does
become
material
because
it
can
be
read
in
a
way
to
indicate
that
the
agent
was
primarily
concerned
with
getting
material
with
which
to
convict
rather
than
pursuing
a
further
investigation.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
--
that
in
our
view,
that
is
the
fact.
but
i
think
the
court
should
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
aware
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
schoolboy
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
the
schoolboy
was
colson.
he
was
another
in
the
ring.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
not
the
big
one
in
the
ring.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
not
massiah,
no,
no.
he
was
another
--
and
he
was
--
he
was
the
intermediary,
as
i
remember
it,
between
colson
and
massiah
and
leon
who
was
the
"big
shot"
if
i
may
use
the
expression.
i
think
that
concludes
my
argument
except
to
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
was
ellis
a
schoolboy?
i'm
sorry.
except
to
say
that
on
this
last
point,
except
for
the
possible
exception
of
one
new
york
case
that
the
authorities
quite
uniformly
sustained
a
view
that
a
confession
obtained
or
an
admission
obtained
under
these
circumstances
may
be
introduced
in
evidence
and
used
to
convict
wigmore
sites
a
list
of
cases
that
confessions
obtained
by
trick
are
admissible.
we
have
cited
a
number
of
federal
cases
in
our
brief
including
a
decision
of
this
court
back
in
251
u.s.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
this
case
still
should
be
affirmed
because
all
those
opinions,
as
i
understand
it,
are
directed
to
an
interrogation
by
--
if
--
of
a
man
who
if
not
in
custody
is
certainly
in
custody
in
a
loose
sense
is
--
and
--
is
being
quizzed
for
the
purpose
in
spano
simply
of
getting
evidence
against
him,
there
was
no
further
investigation
because
that
was
a
crime
of
violence
by
experts
was
an
inquisition.
and
i
can
well
understand
the
rule
that
an
inquisition
by
government
officials
is
to
be
treated
as
part
of
a
criminal
proceeding
and
that
this
is
a
--
perhaps
the
most
useful
way
to
prevent
the
abuses
that
have
often
gone
with
interrogations.
but
this
seems
to
me
to
be
something
quite
outsized.
the
man
was
not
in
custody,
he
was
not
being
interrogated
in
the
same
sense
that
lawyers
or
detectives
would
interrogate.
and
i
would
think
therefore
that
our
position
here
was
consistent
with
the
view
as
expressed
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
spano.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i'd
really
--
i
don't
think
that
this
can
be
properly
described
as
interrogation
by
the
government.
while
--
and
in
spano,
i
would
also
suggest
that
part
of
the
case,
one
of
the
assumptions
i
would've
thought
in
the
concurring
opinion,
was
that
the
man
was
under
some
kind
of
restrain
in
custody
using
the
term
"loosely"
i
don't
mean
--
because
i
don't
recall
whether
he
had
been
arrested
or
not
arrested
in
spano.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
the
only
one
that
occurs
to
me
now,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
it'd
be
a
different
case
and
i
--
well,
i
think
i
would
--
i
--
i
really
think
i
would
need
to
know
more
circumstances.
i'm
--
i
--
i
hesitate,
your
honor,
to
take
--
maybe,
i
should've
thought
through
every
possible
position
but
we
do
have
a
series
of
cases
and
i
hesitate
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
no,
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
that
whether
this
was
the
kind
of
interrogation
that
was
involved
in
spano
depends
upon
a
number
of
circumstances.
one,
that
i
would
think
one
of
the
most
important
ones
was
whether
the
man
is
in
custody
in
the
sense
that
i
have
used
it.
i
use
it
to
include
a
man
who
is
coming
and
we
want
to
talk
to
you,
you're
free
to
go
but
you
better
answer
the
questions.
i
--
that's
not
strictly
custody
and
i
suppose
someday,
i
may
have
to
argue
that
it's
not
custody
but
i'm
using
it
in
that
sense
now.
second,
if
i
might
just
answer,
justice
goldberg,
a
second
thing
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
of
enormous
importance
is
who
is
doing
it?
and
this,
of
course,
in
terms
of
the
canon
of
ethics,
it's
extremely
important
another
--
another
factor,
i
would
say
of
somewhat
less
important,
was
whether
this
is
an
interrogation
or
whether
it
is
simply
overhearing
a
pre-conversation.
and
as
i've
suggested
before,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
should
also
be
taken
into
account,
judging
it
from
the
circumstances
as
one
best
can,
whether
this
is
part
of
an
investigation
or
whether
this
is
something
centered
on
parroting
information
out
against
this
man.
it's
--
it's
that
kind
of
thing
that
i
would
address
myself
to
in
seeking
to
ascertain
whether
this
is
fairly
to
be
thought
of
as
normal
investigation
of
crime
or
whether
it's
really
adding
to
the
rest
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
something
like
the
french
interrogation
before
the
judge
give
instruction.
and
i
would
think
that
this
case
was
on
the
safe
side
that
wherever
the
line
is
to
be
drawn,
it's
to
be
drawn
much
closer
to
formal
interrogation.
the
case
in
the
house
that
you
put
obviously
would
give
me
more
--
more
trouble.
i've
acknowledge
some
trouble
about
this
case
although
i
don't
--
whether
we're
--
i
don't
--
i
come
out
that
it
should
be
affirmed
but
that
one
would
give
me
more
trouble.
i
--
i
don't
think
i
ought
to
permit
the
government
beyond
that.
mr.
justice
white?
thank
you,
your
honors.

archibald
cox

transcript
of
the
recordings

archibald
cox

i
understand
it.
