chief

what
happened
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
--
what
sentence
do
he
received?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
this
man
get?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aiken
was
apparently
from
the
--
from
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
the
most
important
character
in
this
drama.
they
said
that
the
most
important
person
was
aiken.
aiken,
they
alleged,
was
the
kingpin.
aiken,
what
they
alleged,
was
involved
for
many
years
in
this
--
in
this
circumstance.
and
aiken
was
connected
with
a
person
with
whom
massiah
was
allegedly
connected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
fact,
colson's
testimony
here
that
--
to
the
affect
that
he
was
threatened,
is
that
any
place
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
alright,
go
ahead.
i'll
find
it.
chief
justice

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
pleaded
guilty
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
that
--
does
that
excuse
putting
on
secondary
evidence
or
for
witness
just
says,
"i
refuse
to
talk
because
i'm
afraid
of
what
might
happen
to
me
if
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
are
we
--
are
we
entitled
to
assume
that
--
that
the
action
of
colson
was
government
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
had
turned
the
car
over
to
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
would
use
in
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
colson
--
without
colson,
how
do
we
know
what
induced
the
petitioner
to
go
into
that
car?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
take
--
take
your
time,
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
you're
testifying
to
a
conversation
against
the
defendant,
is
he
not
entitled
to
know
the
entire
conversation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
deal
with
these
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'm
thinking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
this.
all
mr.
murphy
could
testify
to
would
be
what
he
heard
on
that
day.
now,
obviously,
this
was
a
trap
for
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
the
government
would
deny
that.
they
set
the
trap
for
him.
they
put
the
--
they
put
the
machine
in
the
place.
they,
in
some
way
or
the
other,
they
--
the
two
of
them
came
together.
now,
how
do
--
how
do
we
know
what
--
what
colson
used
any
manner
of
deception
or
any
manner
of
--
of
deceit
in
order
to
bring
this
man
into
the
automobile
and
therefore
into
the
trap?
and
mr.
murphy
wouldn't
hear
any
of
that.
all
he
would
hear
would
be
what
occurred
through
the
use
of
that
tape.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
don't
use
mr.
colson
that
you
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
very
--
a
very
important
right
that
he
has
to
--
to
test
the
importance
of
this
conversation
and
the
real
effect
of
it
by
cross-examining
mr.
colson
who
was
the
man
who
sprung
the
trap
on
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
no
difference
whether
that
was
just
a
normal
conversation
between
two
individuals
or
whether
one
of
them
was
working
for
the
government
at
the
time
and
had
set
a
trap
for
that
to
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
we
have
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
we
have
one
just
a
year
or
so
ago
when
your
--
when
your
office
was
arguing
that
a
man
who
is
in
the
identical
position
of
--
of
this
man,
colson?
he
had
pleaded
guilty
and
was
sentenced
to
a
long
term
in
the
penitentiary.
and
--
and
then
the
government
--
he
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
and
they
said,
"oh,
no,
you
can't
--
you
can't
do
that
because
we
are
for
immunity."
and
they
offered
him
immunity
and
when
he
didn't
--
when
he
wouldn't
testify,
they
tacked
on
a
few
more
years
in
the
penitentiary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
--
you
won
the
case
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
won
the
case,
there
was
a
dissent
but
you
won
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
doesn't
it
work
both
ways?
chief
justice
earl
warren
strange?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
government
had
done
it
the
day
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
as
strange.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
colson
testify
in
the
anfield
(ph)
case,

you
happen
to
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

your
final
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
colson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ellis
was
a
schoolboy
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
have
five
extra
minutes
if
you
wish.
the
--
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
put
so
much
time
with
the
solicitor
general
so
if
you
wish
it,
you
may
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
on
20?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
one
other
place,
they
use
the
word
"agent"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
all
right
(voice

--

justice
earl
warren
