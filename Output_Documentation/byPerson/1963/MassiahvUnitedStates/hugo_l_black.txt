justice

l.
black
what
do
you
do
with
on
lee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
out
on
bail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me
but
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
for
i
don't
understand
it
clearly.
you
say
that
unavailability
was
the
objection
to
his
not
being
wrote
under
the
witness
by
the
government
or
the
objection
is
not
being
wrote
in
so
they
can
make
him
a
witness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
available
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
available
to
both
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
be
--
may
i
ask
you
if
there's
anything
else
in
the
record
about
this
that
he
has
previously
referred
to
us
because
it's
quite
different
from
my
brother
goldberg.
i
do
not
read
this
as
request
that
this
man
we
brought
in
to
testify
for
the
defendant.
he
wanted
to
cross-examine
and
he
said
that
man
he
wanted
the
government
but
it
--
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
strange.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
followed
your
most
of
your
argument,
probably
i
agree
with
most
of
it.i
wonder
if
you
think
however
that
if
the
concurring
opinion
in
spano,
the
two
concurring
opinion
would
correctly
stated
the
local
record,
what
would
you
say
about
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
took
your
position,
as
i'm
read
them,
that
a
man
who
is
indicted,
pressed
charges
pending
against
him
in
the
government
should
not
be
interrogated
by
the
government
without
the
presence
of
his
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
distinction
you
can
see
in
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
as
far
as
the
liability
is
concerned,
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
reliable
if
you're
going
to
hit
the
conversation
who's
admissible
in
evidence
and
they
have
it
recorded
on
a
machine
which
can't
lie.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
really
asked
you
that
question
because
i
think
the
--
the
choice
of
words
that
can
be
used
will
fit
your
argument
better
than
to
say
that
certain
reliable,
more
unreliable
in
the
witness'
statement
about
what
was
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
secondary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
secondary
as
to
the
statement
of
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
--
if
--
if
it's
his
voice,
we
have
evidence
that
he
talked
in
the
record,
he
have
his
lawyers,
why
would
it
then
be
secondary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
different
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
conversation
--
if
the
statement
made
by
somebody
is
admissible,
i
can
see
no
difference
as
to
its
admissibility,
the
next
move
it's
written
on
the
record
or
whether
--
you
don't
wait
to
bring
him
in
because
then,
he
would
have
to
repeat
what
he
had
said.
but
as
conceding
that
it's
admissible,
i
can
see
no
reason
why
this
wouldn't
be
an
admissible,
more
--
more
reliable
in
any
kind
of
evidence
you
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
mean
admissibility
of
a
record
of
what
somebody
says
on
a
tape.
sometimes,
they
are
too
truthful,
i
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
record
two-minute
defects.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
defects
in
the
speech.
