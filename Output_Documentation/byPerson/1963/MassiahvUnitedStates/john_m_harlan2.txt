justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
question
about
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
counsel
said
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
recording
was
entirely
available
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
do
you
even
think
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
make
any
kind
of
an
--
or
let
me
put
it
in
other
way,
do
you
think
that
some
kinds
of
investigation
even
though
directed
towards
a
particular
defendant,
they're
permissible
after
indictment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
recording
itself
was
never
admitted
in
evidence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that's
not
in
the
court
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
about
--
you're
under
indictment
and
not
on
bail
and
he
said
--
the
district
attorney
knew
that
he
was
represented
and
then
he
said
to
the
keeper,
"i'd
like
to
talk
to
an
assistant
united
states
attorney,"
and
the
assistant
came
down
and
talked
with
him,
he
said,
“i
want
to
tell
you
the
whole
story.”
and
they
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
assistant
knows
that
he's
represented
by
a
counsel
should
he
then
take
the
story?
can
you
see
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
should
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
are
we
at
liberty
to
read
the
transcript
of
the
recording?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
is
the
reason
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
would
have
a
bearing
if
any
of
these
and
there's
some
kind
of
a
single
rule
is
going
to
be
laid
down
on
these
rather
complicated
situations,
complicated
cases.
the
transcript
would
have
a
bearing
as
to
whether
this
is
to
be
characterized
as
investigation
at
large
or
directed
the
preparation
for
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
--
and
i
think
it's
enough
and
this
is
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
was
just
trying
to
get
enlighten
of
--
criticize
your
--
put
you
on
a
difficult
position.
it's
enough
that
that
transcript
is
not
an
evidence
and
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
i'm
not
going
to
read
it.
