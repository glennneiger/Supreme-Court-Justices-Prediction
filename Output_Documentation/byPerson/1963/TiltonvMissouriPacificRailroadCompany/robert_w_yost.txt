mr.
robert
w.
yost
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
compliment
mr.
heymann
on
a
very
fair
presentation
of
the
facts
and
the
issues
in
this
case.
and
i'll
try
to
avoid
repeating
too
much
but
i
think
it
is
essential
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
the
facts
in
the
case
and
what
the
court
below
found.
in
the
first
place,
there
were
these
two
entirely
distinct
classifications
of
work
under
the
collective
bargain
agreement.
one
was
the
carman
helper
and
the
other
was
the
carman.
now
these
veterans
were
classified
before
they
went
into
military
service,
after
they
went
in
the
--
after
they
came
back
from
military
service
as
carman
helpers.
they
were
not
classified
as
carmen.
these
two
classes
of
work
had
different
job
descriptions
which
were
provided
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
carman
helper
was
confined
to
doing
the
unskilled
tasks
involving
repair
of
cars
and
the
carman
was
a
skilled
craftsman
who
had
all
the
responsibilities
such
as
the
master
carpenter
has
in
building
a
house.
the
carman
helper
never
had
the
right
to
do
the
carman's
work
and
the
carman
never
had
the
right
to
do
the
carman
helper's
work.
these
were
entirely
different
categories.
there
were
separate
seniority
as
providers.
the
carman
helper
was
on
one
list
and
the
carmen
journeymen
were
on
entirely
separate
list.
these
veterans
then
had
no
seniority
whatever
as
carmen
when
they
went
into
military
service.
they
had
no
way,
there
was
no
possible
way
under
the
contract
for
them
to
do
carmen's
work
or
to
transfer
to
a
carman's
seniority
escalator
except
under
the
provisions
of
the
specific
agreement
that
was
adopted
in
december
1953
between
the
collective
bargaining
agent
and
the
railroad.
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
get
into
primarily.
i'd
like
to
mention
before
that
that
this
--
this
court
has
recognized
that
seniority
is
not
inherent
in
the
job.
it
is
a
matter
of
contract.
seniority
grows
out
of
contract
and
contract
alone.
i
might
quote
this
one
statement
in
the
case
of
aeronautical
lodge
against
campbell.
"barring
legislation
not
here
involved,
seniority
rights
derive
their
scope
and
their
significance
from
union
contracts,
confined
as
they
are
almost
exclusively
to
unionized
industry."
now,
what
was
the
contract
of
1953?
first
of
all,
it
said
when
the
qualified
carmen
were
not
available,
then,
the
railroad
could
utilize
the
services
of
the
helper
to
do
the
carmen's
work.
it
was
only
when
these
qualified
carmen
were
not
available
that
these
helpers
could
work
as
carmen.
and
that
vary
with
conditions,
jobs
maybe
cut
off
and
there
would
be
ample
carmen
available
or
jobs
might
be
added
to
the
situation
at
a
particular
point
and
there
would
be
fewer
carmen
and
therefore
more
helpers
would
be
able
to
do
the
carmen's
work.
it
provided
also
that
if
they
were
selected
to
do
the
carmen's
work,
and
incidentally,
an
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg,
they
were
selected
on
a
basis
that
they
have
the
aptitude
and
were
willing
to
take
over
the
job,
they
were
not
considered
qualified
at
all
as
carmen
when
they
started
out.
they
were
just
like
beginning
apprentices
who
were
beginning
their
apprenticeship.
it
provided
that
if
they
were
selected
to
do
this
carman's
work,
they
would
retain
their
helper's
seniority.
they
did
not
go
over
on
the
carmen
help
--
on
the
carmen's
seniority
list
and
they
were
not
considered
qualified
carmen
at
that
time.
having
retained
their
helper's
seniority,
they
could
exercise
it
at
anytime
they
chose
to
exercise
it.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
have
to
take
this
carman's
work
that
became
available
to
them.
they
could
go
back
to
working
as
a
helper
and
many
times
they
did
that
very
thing
because
they
might
have
a
better
hour,
you
see
they
were
higher
up
on
the
carman
helpers
list.
they
were
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
--
of
the
working
group
of
carman.
they
could
only
take
the
worst
positions
as
carmen
and
so
they
might
have
better
hours,
they
might
even
work
more
overtime
so
that
they
would
earn
more
pay
as
helpers
and
sometimes
they
did
exercise
their
helper
seniority
in
preference
to
doing
the
carman's
work.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that's
correct.
the
term
“upgraded”
meant
that
he
was
selected
to
do
the
carman's
work
when
qualified
carmen
were
not
available
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
they
were
upgraded
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
--
before
they
went
into
military
service.
however,
it
--
it
--
this
is
not
significant
but
it
been
only
short
time.
i
mean,
one
of
them
had
been
working
for
21
days
for
example
before
he
went
into
military
service.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
in
a
sense,
the
contract
that
--
that's
what
i
want
to
get
into
immediately.
the
--
the
contract
specified
that
before
a
man
could
be
considered
a
qualified
carman
and
acquire
carman
seniority,
he
had
to
have
this
actual
work
experience
of
1040
days.
so
in
a
sense
it
was
a
training
period
such
as
an
apprenticeship.
however,
there
was
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
during
this
training
period
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
during
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
if
the
man
proved
inept
at
the
work,
he
could
be
demoted
and
--
and
put
back
to
working
as
a
carman
helper,
certainly.
that's
--
that's
true
in
any
employment
contract
i
think.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
work
in
a
carman's
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
and
--
and
--
and
i
want
you
to
bear
in
mind
also
that
the
1040
days
is
not
a
four-year
calendar
period
of
any
kind.
a
record
was
kept
by
the
railroad
of
every
single
working
day
that
the
man
worked
in
a
carman's
position
and
when
it
--
it
accumulated
to
1040
days
whether
that
be
done
in
four
years
or
whether
it
be
done
in
10
years
or
--
or
whenever.
then
he
was
notified
that
he
had
accumulated
the
1040
days.
until
then,
he
was
not
considered
a
qualified
carman
and
had
no
contractual
right
to
a
carman's
seniority.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
at
the
end
of
the
1040
days,
he
had
the
right
to
choose
between
the
helper's
seniority
and
the
carman's
seniority.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
if
he
wanted
to,
he
could
be
a
carman
at
that
point
provided
he
gave
up
this
helpers
--
he
--
he
had
no
right
to
keep
both
the
helper
seniority
and
acquire
the
carman
seniority.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
of
work
experience
in
carman's
positions.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
it
didn't
specify
satisfactory.
that
was
certainly
implied.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
he
could've
been
discharged
or
demoted,
sure
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
the
1040
days
was
negotiated,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
in
1942,
the
first
agreement
right
at
during
world
war
ii
specified
three
years.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
no,
there
were
not.
there
were
no
courses
a
man
had
to
take.
there
were
no
special
requirements
to
pass
any
tests
or
anything
and
that's
--
it
was
simply
work
experience
that
was
required
in
order
to
acquire
the
necessary
skills
that
--
that
qualify
the
man
to
become
a
journeyman.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
at
the
end
of
the
1040
days,
you
--
did
you
say?
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
they
had
the
right
to
get
on
the
carman's
seniority
list
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
they
--
they
went
on
the
carmen
seniority
list
as
of
the
date
they
completed
the
1040
days
if
--
if
they
so
chose.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
the
--
once
they
completed
the
1040
days,
it
was
--
and
--
and
relinquish
their
helper
seniority,
it
was
automatic.
that
we
concede.
it
was
automatic
at
that
point
but
we
don't
concede
it
was
automatic
up
to
that
point.
now,
this
--
this
should
be
kept
in
mind,
the
contract
provided
that
the
only
seniority
which
these
people
could
choose
once
they
completed
this
1040
days
of
experience
was
the
ending
date
of
the
1040
days
of
service
as
carman.
they
didn't
have
any
other
choice
and
we
say,
if
they
--
if
they
relinquish
their
helper
seniority
and
chose
that
date,
then
they
can't
say,
“well,
we're
entitled
to
another
date”
because
that
was
the
only
date
that
was
offered
to
them
under
this
contract.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
court
specifically
found
that
--
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
agreement
was
to
serve
as
an
--
an
on-the-job
training
program
so
that
they
could
increase
their
skill
and
proficiency
and
become
a
qualified
carman.
and
the
--
and
--
and
the
only
way
they
could
become
a
qualified
carman
was
to
get
this
experience
just
as
any
apprentice
has
to
take
several
years
of
training
in
order
to
become
a
qualified
journeyman.
and
because
of
the
--
the
way
this
was
determined,
that
is
their
qualification
and
eligibility
to
become
carmen
because
of
the
way
this
was
determined,
this
was
not
depended
on
their
seniority
as
--
as
helpers
at
all.
in
other
words,
seniority
is
a
matter
that
accumulates
automatically
day
by
day.
this
thing
depended
on
the
day
they
completed
the
1040
days
of
--
of
service
as
carmen
and
that
depended
in
turn
on
their
opportunities
that
the
opportunities
available
to
them
to
work
as
carmen.
it
depended
on
their
willingness
at
all
times
to
work
as
carmen
when
the
opportunity
came.
it
depended
on
the
fact
that
they
were
always
present
and
that
they
weren't
--
taken
a
vacation
or
they
weren't
ill
for
any
length
of
time.
it
depended
on
the
fact
that
they
continued
to
do
the
satisfactory
work
as
a
carman.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
no
sir.
the
--
the
opportunity
to
work
as
a
carman,
if
the
man
was
present
and
willing
to
so
work
depended
upon
his
date
of
upgrading
could
--
not
--
not
his
seniority
as
a
helper.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
except
that
the
contract
specifically
said
that
wasn't
--
not
a
seniority.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
but
it
--
essentially,
that's
what
it
amounted
to.
now,
these
veterans
are
trying
to
get
this
court
to
construe
section
9
(c)
(2)
which
uses
the
words
continuously
employed
as
if
that
meant
continuously
at
work
in
acquiring
the
skills
which
a
company
--
that
working
experience.
now
we
say
section
9
(c)
(1)
of
the
act
is
completely
inconsistent
with
this
interpretation
because
section
9
(c)
(1),
they
took
mandatory
that
the
court
treat
--
that
the
employer
treat
these
veterans
as
though
they
had
been
on
leave
of
absence.
not
at
work,
no
man
cannot
be
on
leave
of
absence
and
--
and
be
at
work
at
the
same
time,
that's
just
impossible.
so,
you've
got
to
find
another
construction
for
the
words
“continuously
employed”
if
it's
going
to
be
consistent
with
this
leave
of
absence
test.
and
we
say
the
court
has
already
furnished
that
explanation,
that
--
that
interpretation
in
the
mckinney
case.
mckinney
case
said
that
only
the
rights
which
flowed
from
seniority
alone
which
came
about
--
which
accrued
to
the
veteran
while
he
was
on
leave
of
absence
because
of
his
seniority
position
which
accumulated
during
that
leave
of
absence
could
be
claimed
on
the
veteran's
return.
but
those
rights
which
flowed
only
and
depended
upon
his
experience,
his
skill,
his
qualifications,
those
--
those
rights
could
not
be
claimed
as
a
matter,
automatic
right.
they
--
they
had
to
be
earned
and
we
say
these
veterans'
rights
as
carmen
had
to
be
earned
under
this
contract.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
it's
hard
to
say
because
the
facts
were
so
unclear
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
diehl
--
in
the
diehl
case
and
of
course,
the
court
wrote
no
opinion
in
the
diehl
case.
what
the
court
had
in
mind,
i
can't
--
for
the
life
of
me
determine
the
absence
of
an
opinion,
i
can
only
guess.
now
--
now,
i
think
the
--
the
mckinney
case
did
add
this
qualification
to
the
diehl
case.
mckinney
did
take
out
of
--
of
the
interpretation
of
this
“continuously
employed.”
the
--
the
rights
which
flowed
from
the
work
experience.
in
other
words,
that
the
--
justice
frankfurter
distinguished
between
seniority
and
--
and
actual
work
experience
in
the
mckinney
case.
and
whether
the
court
had
that
distinction
in
mind
in
the
diehl
case,
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
the
mckinney
decision?
mr.
robert
w.
yost
well,
what
i
made
out
of
that
is
that
--
if
as
a
matter
of
actual
practice
and
construction
of
the
contract,
the
--
the
parties
made
a
--
a
new
contract
or
in
other
words,
modified
a
written
contract
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
no
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that
in
--
in
actual
practice
under
the
contract,
the
veteran
had
the
right
to
be
promoted
to
take
this
group
one
position.
that
could
be
shown
to
be
the
case
by
the
veteran
and
he's
entitled
to
that.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
in
this
--
in
this
case?
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
and
then
there
weren't
any
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
if
--
if
they
were
depending
on
whether
there
were
a
carmen
available
of
course.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
i'd
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
just
--
justice
frankfurter
said
that
rights
which
flow
from
experience,
skill,
effort
and
chance
cannot
be
claimed
by
the
veteran.
that
those
--
those
things
are
not
just
--
just
discretionary
with
the
employer.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that
was
certainly
the
--
the
significant
decision
of
that
case.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
well,
if
we
conclude
that
the
--
the
matter
of
management
discretion
is
the
only
way
that
that
the
court
decision
below
can
be
upheld,
then
that's
right.
but
i
--
i
think
we
have
to
find
out
what
is
meant
by
continuously
employed
in
the
statute
because
that
--
that's
the
whole
basis
for
their
--
their
claim
in
this
case.
what
is
meant
by
continuously
employed?
does
it
mean
continuously
at
work,
getting
the
skills
that
can
only
be
gotten
by
being
continuously
at
work?
or
does
it
meant
--
does
it
mean
that
a
man
can
be
on
leave
of
absences
as
--
as
contemplated
in
section
9
(c)
(1)
and
still
be
continuously
an
employee.
a
man
might
be
an
employee
even
though
he
isn't
at
work.
he
can
be
an
employee
when
he's
on
weekends,
when
he's
not
at
the
office
on
weekends,
when
he's
on
a
vacation,
when
he's
home
in
the
evenings.
he's
not
working,
he's
not
getting
experience
and
skill
but
he
is
an
employee.
and
that's
what
we
think
that
this
isn't
--
congress
meant
by
the
--
by
the
use
of
those
words.
at
any
rate,
we
think
that
whether
they
intended
it
or
not,
it
has
to
be
so
construed
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
the
prior
section
of
the
very
same
statute
and
i
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
because
--
well,
i
think
i
can
explain
that
by
going
to
the
history
of
this
--
this
statute,
i
think
that's
important
in
order
to
understand
it.
the
house
bill,
when
this
thing
came
up
from
(inaudible)
in
1948,
the
house
bill
had
provided
that
the
veteran
shall
be
treated
as
though
he
had
been
continuously
at
work
while
he
was
on
military
--
while
in
service.
the
conference
committee
rejected
that
language
and
he
used
the
words
of
the
senate
bill
which
said
“continuously
employed.”
now,
in
explaining
this
language,
the
senate
committee
said,
first
of
all
that
this
was
merely
a
statement
of
the
escalator
principle
which
had
been
recognized
by
the
court
in
a
fishgold
case.
and
--
and
secondly,
they
said
specifically
that
they
did
not
intend
by
this
amendment
to
confer
any
additional
rights
on
veterans
under
the
1948
act
then
had
been
granted
the
veterans
under
the
1940
act
so
they
did
not
intend
to
change
the
law
in
any
way,
you
see?
and
furthermore,
the
language
which
they
used
here
said,
it
--
it
shall
be
this
--
it
should
--
it
--
it
is
a
sense
of
congress
that
the
veterans
should
be
so
treated
as
if
you've
been
continuously
employed.
and
then,
they
go
on
and
amend
section
(d)
which
is
the
enforcement
section
of
the
act
so
as
not
to
provide
any
enforcement
of
this
very
section
that
the
veterans
rely
on.
the
--
section
(d)
says
that
--
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enforce
section
9
(b)
and
9
(c)
(1)
but
it
expressly
omits
9
(c)
(2)
from
the
enforcement
section.
now,
the
mckinney
case
said
that
this
9
(c)
(2)
was
nothing
more
than
a
clarification
of
the
escalator
principle.
in
the
escalator
principle,
there's
nothing
more
than
a
recognition
by
this
court
of
the
facts
of
seniority.
in
other
words,
seniority
accumulates
while
a
man
is
on
leave
of
absence
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
whatever
benefits
may
accrue
to
his
seniority
position
while
he
is
on
leave
of
absence.that's
all
the
fishgold
case
held.
and
that's
all
the
escalator
principle
says
and
that's
all
this
9
(c)
(2)
means
in
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
that's
right.
if
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
a
man
has
a
right
to
have
retroactive
qualification
for
a
promotion
or
--
can
be
considered
as
having
qualified
prior
to
the
time
he
actually
qualified.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
the
--
the
statute
requires
that
he
be
restored
to
his
previous
position
and
the
--
with
the
previous
seniority
rights
and
such
rights
as
have
accrued
to
him
during
his
period
of
military
absence.
that
was
done,
there's
no
argument
about
that
part.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
accumulating
during
this
period
of
absence.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
well,
i
mean
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
remember
that
he
didn't
have
any
seniority
as
a
carman
or
as
an
upgrader
helper
for
that
matter.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
he
had
the
right
to
--
to
work
as
a
carman
when
such
work
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
--
was
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
yost
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
yost
but,
remember
this
that
the
--
the
date
of
completion
of
this
1040-day
period
didn't
--
didn't
depend
on
his
seniority
as
a
helper.
in
other
words
a
man
might
take
10
years.
a
--
a
senior
man
might
take
10
years
and
that's
actually
the
fact.
they
might
take
10
years
to
accomplish
these
1040
days
of
service.
and
the
junior
man
might
be
right
there
joining
on
the
spot
and
accomplish
it
in
four
years
or
less.
now,
in
--
in
--
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
merely
state
that
we
think
that
the
qualification
for
a
carman's
seniority
was
not
an
automatic
thing.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
depend
on
seniority,
it
didn't
accompany
seniority.
it
was
something
that
had
to
be
learned
and
something
that
they
had
to
earn
by
this
actual
work
experience
and
we
think
that
since
congress
rejected
the
position
in
which
veterans
here
are
taken
that
they
be
considered
as
having
been
actually
on
the
job
during
their
period
of
military
service
that
--
that
this
court
should
take
the
same
position.
thank
you.
