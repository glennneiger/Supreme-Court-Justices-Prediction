going
back
just
a
moment,
i
just
don't
quite
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
understand
what
determines
whether
a
helper
is
to
become
an
upgraded
helper.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
not
really
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
these
people
all
were
upgraded.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
assuming
that
there
maybe
or
was
some
discretion,
management
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
helper,
these
helpers
should
become
upgraded
helper
but
in
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
event
that
was
water
over
the
bridge.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
bridge
or
over
the
dam.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
statute
does
there
say
and
maybe
i've
missed
a
part
of
your
argument
that
he
shall
be
considered
as
having
been
on
leave
of
absence.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
also
says
somewhere
else
that
he
should
be
considered
as
having
been
employed
continuously,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
in
9
(c)
(1)
that
he
should
be
treated
as
if
he
had
been
on
leave
of
absences
or
furlough.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they're
both
in
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
if
--
if
these
people
had
been
on
leave
of
absence,
the
company
would
be
correct
in
its
position.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
they
have
been
continuously
employed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
think
this
whole
one
side,
any
question
of
management
discretion,
you'd
be
right
in
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
says
both.
