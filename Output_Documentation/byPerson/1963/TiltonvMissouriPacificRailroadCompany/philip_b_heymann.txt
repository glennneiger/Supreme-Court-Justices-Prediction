mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
section
9
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
of
1948.
that
section
and
its
predecessor
provisions
which
go
back
constant
--
continually
to
1940
draft
act
give
veterans
certain
reemployment
rights
on
their
return
from
military
service.
stating
the
facts
of
the
case
requires
making
clear
the
relationship
between
three
of
the
many
categories
of
employees
in
the
railroads,
maintenance
and
repair
shops.
the
first
category
is
that
of
carman.
carman
does
the
most
skilled
work
of
the
three.
gets
paid
the
highest
pay
and
has
its
own
seniority
roster.
the
second
category
is
that
of
carman
helper
that
does
less
skilled
work,
gets
paid
on
a
lower
scale
and
has
--
the
carman
helpers
have
their
own
seniority
roster.
the
third
category
is
something
of
a
hybrid
between
the
two.
because
of
shortages
among
carmen,
sometimes
helpers
are
upgraded
to
do
carman's
work.
an
upgraded
carman
helper
does
carman's
work,
gets
paid
a
carman's
wage
but
doesn't
obtain
carman's
seniority
until
he's
worked
1040
days,
“a
1040-day
training
period
as
an
upgraded
carman
helper.”
in
the
meantime,
he
retains
his
seniority
as
a
helper
and
he
also
obtains
something
very
much
like
seniority
as
an
upgraded
helper.
he
gets
a
date
when
he's
upgraded
and
that
date
determines
his
right
to
demand
work
as
a
carman,
work
towards
1040
days.
in
terms
of
these
three
categories,
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
simply
stated.
tilton,
beck
and
mcclearn
were
already
upgraded
helpers
when
they
went
into
the
military
service.
the
only
discretion
that
management
has
had
been
exercised
at
that
point
in
their
--
where
there
is
apparently
discretion
in
upgrading
but
they'd
already
been
upgraded.
during
the
time
they
were
in
military
service,
they
were
passed
in
the
number
of
days
work
towards
1040-day
requirement
by
a
number
of
junior
upgraded
helpers
who
would've
had
a
subordinate
right
to
work
had
these
veterans
been
present.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
justice
stewart
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
--
the
record
indicates
–
there
was
a
lot
of
argument,
justice
stewart
in
the
record
about
whether
upgrading
is
automatic.
i
have
no
idea
why
there
was
that
argument.
there
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it's
an
issue
at
all.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they
were
all
upgraded
when
they
went
and
this
is
also
true
in
the
next
--
well,
in
the
next
case
as
an
apprentice.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it's
an
issue
at
all.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
from
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
exactly,
exactly.
the
purpose
of
this
case
we
can
concede
there
was
discretion
at
that
stage.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
but
--
when
--
because
they
were
passed
by
when
they
return
and
completed
their
1040
days
of
work,
they
found
that
formerly
junior
upgraded
helpers
already
had
carman
status
and
seniority.
they
asked
to
have
their
seniority
dates
set
back
so
that
they
would
maintain
the
same
relative
seniority
position
with
regard
to
these
people
that
they
had
had
when
they
were
--
when
they
had
gone
into
the
military
service,
at
the
time
when
they
were
all
upgraded
helpers.
the
employer
refused.
the
suit
resulted.
the
district
court
held
for
the
employer
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
saying
in
substance
that
the
veteran
can
only
claim
on
his
return
what
would've
been
his
absolutely,
certainly
and
forseeably
at
the
time
he
left.
as
it
were
the
employees
to
be
--
the
veterans
to
be
treated
as
if
he
had
been
on
leave
of
absence
and
accrued
only
those
rights
which
are
near
functions
of
lapse
of
time.
i'd
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
stating
what
we
conceived
to
be
the
issue
of
the
case.
one
of
the
central
functions
of
section
9,
perhaps
the
central
function
is
to
grant
to
veterans,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right,
those
benefits
of
seniority
in
position
that
would've
come
to
them
as
a
matter
of
contract
right
had
they
not
been
away
in
military
service.
in
the
words
of
this
court,
in
the
words
of
section
9
(c)
(2),
had
they
been
continuously
employed
and
i
--
i
now
use
those
words
in
quote
so
i
don't
mean
to
say
anything
by
them,
had
they
not
been
away.
perhaps
the
most
important
of
these
benefits
of
seniority
in
position
is
the
relative
seniority
position
of
the
veteran.
the
importance
of
this
benefit
of
course
flows
from
a
large
number
of
other
rights
that
are
a
function
of
relative
seniority
position.
security
on
the
jobs,
security
against
layoffs,
preferences
in
work,
vacation
times,
each
of
these
is
a
function
of
seniority.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
veteran
is
entitled
to
be
protected
in
his
relative
seniority
position
not
only
in
the
position
he
left
but
also
in
the
position
to
which
he
and
his
fellow
employees
have
advanced
and
been
able
to
claim
as
a
matter
of
right
on
completion
of
a
1040-day
work
period.
our
contention
is
very
simply
that
the
seniority
these
veterans
claim
would've
been
theirs
a
matter
of
contract
right
had
they
have
been
continuously
employed
in
a
sense
of
continuously
present
and
on
the
job
whenever
they
would've
had
a
right
to
work.
the
eighth
circuit
agreed
that
they
would've
had
a
right
to
a
seniority
position
they
claim
had
they
have
been
continuously
present
and
on
the
job
whenever
they
had
a
right
to
work.
but
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
when
this
court
has
said,
“continuously
employed”
or
when
we're
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
veteran
would've
been
--
had
he
not
been
absent
in
military
service,
he's
not
entitled
to
be
treated
as
if
he
had
been
at
work
whenever
he
had
a
right
to
work.
he
should
be
treated
as
if
he
had
been
on
leave
of
absence.
now,
that
that
frame
is
the
issue
as
we
see
it,
does
continuously
employed
means
continuously
on
leave
of
absence,
or
continuously
at
work
when
the
veteran
had
a
right
to
work.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
justice
goldberg.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
record
indicates
that
this
has
never
happened
without
the
employee's
--
without
the
employee's
agreement
in
the
history
--
in
the
--
in
the
memory
of
anyone
that
was
present.
but
i
--
i
would
again
be
prepared
to
concede
that
if
his
performance
were
inadequate,
he
could've
been
relieved
from
his
job
of
upgraded
helper.
they're
seen
--
this
is
a
right
but
you
don't
easily
imply
away.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
adequate
--
adequate
performance
justice
goldberg,
we
would
insist,
is
always
a
condition
of
a
--
of
continuing
seniority
in
the
simplest
case.
in
the
case
where
the
veteran
has
gone
and
returned
at
the
same
position,
he
wouldn't
have
had
--
he
wouldn't
have
increased
seniority
in
that
position
unless
he
had
adequately
performed
there.
now,
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
in
the
brooks
--
the
brooks
case
which
is
the
next
case
mr.
chief
justice
is
an
apprenticeship
and
i
will
argue
in
that
case
with
the
exact
same
rule
applies
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
cases.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
says
in
9
(c)
--
that
was
at
--
that
was
in
1940
in
9
(c)
(2),
provision
was
added
that
was
--
which
at
--
in
1948,
a
provision
was
added
as
9
(c)
(2)
which
says,
“give
him
the
status
he
would
have
had
had
he
been
continuously
employed."
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
9
(c)
(2)
is
declared
to
be
the
sense
of
congress.
i
think
justice
burton
once
said,
“how
congress
believes
9
(c)
(1)
should
be
interpreted.”
9
(c)
(1)
is
a
statutory
provision
in
itself.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that
but
i
don't
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
would
be
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
would
be
right.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
there
is
--
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
--
i
don't
believe,
of
management
discretion.
there's
no
place
at
all
where
management
discretion
comes
into
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
the
infirmities
of
what
--
of
being
a
human
being
which
can
interfere
with
work
when
a
man
has
a
right
to
work,
prevent
him
from
maintaining
his
relative
position.
but
i'd
like
to
go
to
furlough
and
leave
of
absence,
if
--
if
i
may.
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
the
tilton
case
is
almost
a
mirror
copy
of
a
case
decided
by
this
--
by
this
court
in
favor
of
the
veteran
after
full
briefing
and
oral
argument
in
1955,
diehl
versus
lehigh
valley
railroad.
now,
that's
a
square
precedent
as
--
as
one
can
have.
in
diehl,
like
as
here
--
oh,
let
me
take
--
let
me
use
the
name
diehl.diehl
like
tilton
was
an
upgraded
carman
helper
when
he
went
into
military
service.
diehl
like
tilton
apparently
had
rights
--
had
prior
rights
to
work
when
work
--
when
carman's
work
was
available
over
those
who
had
been
upgraded
after
him.
he
was
passed
because
of
his
service
time.
on
his
return,
the
employer
and
the
union
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
saying
that
upgraded
helpers
should
be
given
carman's
status
and
seniority
after
1160
days
of
work
instead
of
1040
days.
diehl
claimed
that
his
date
should
be
set
back
to
preserve
his
relative
position.
he
should
be
given
the
position
he
would've
--
he
had
when
he
left.
the
third
circuit
--
the
employer
refused,
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
employer
in
grounds
very
much
like
those
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
here.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
saying,
in
a
way
that
reflects
justice
stewart's
question,
the
third
circuit
said,
“if
this
man
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
if
he
were
continuously
employed”
and
the
third
circuit
said,
“that's
the
language
the
supreme
court
has
used
in
oakley,”
that
was
one
of
the
leading
preceding
cases.
if
he's
entitled
to
be
treated
as
continuously
employed
in
the
language
that
congress
used
in
9
(c)
(2)
then
diehl
was
entitled
to
be
given
credit,
given
the
seniority
position
he
claims
because
he
would
have
had
it
if
he
was
continuously
employed.
however,
we
believe
the
leave
of
absence
in
furlough
language
controls.
there
was
full
argument
and
full
briefing
in
this
court
of
appeals
--
this
court
reversed
per
curiam
citing
oakley
where
the
court
had
said
that
the
veteran
should
be
treated
as
if
he'd
been
continuously
employed.
now,
we
know
of
no
distinction
between
the
diehl
case
and
this
case.
the
respondents
have
suggested
that
maybe
this
court
thought
in
diehl
that
the
1160-day
period
wasn't
actually
a
work
period
but
that's
simply
impossible
in
the
facts.
the
court
of
appeals
had
called
it
an
experience
period
repeatedly.
in
there
briefs
in
this
court,
the
parties
made
absolutely
clear
that
the
1160-day
period
was
a
required
work
period.
the
eighth
circuit
suggest
that
diehl
maybe
different
because
there
was
a
stipulation
upon
what
date
diehl
would've
completed
his
work.
one
answer
to
this
is
i
think,
the
eighth
circuit
was
misled
in
thinking
there
was
--
unintentionally
misled
in
thinking
there
was
a
stipulation,
there
wasn't
stipulation.
the
facts
were
that
diehl
had
alleged
that
he
would
complete
his
work
on
a
certain
date
and
his
complaint
was
dismissed
and
for
purposes
of
the
complaint
it
was
taken
as
true.
but
this
was
by
no
means
equivalent
to
taking
as
true
what
was
palpably
and
always
will
be
untrue
and
that
is
that
there
are
--
that
there
were
no
contingencies
that
could
interfere
with
diehl's
completion
of
his
work
period.
obviously,
sickness
and
even
number
of
things
could.
now,
since
we
believe
that
the
diehl
case
is
this
case,
the
only
question
is
whether
the
--
this
court's
only
case
since
diehl,
the
mckinney
case
overruled
diehl.
i
--
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
that
was
at
the
heart
of
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion.
the
eighth
circuit
wasn't
really
trying
to
say
that
diehl
was
different.
it
ended
up
saying
if
--
how
diehl
and
mckinney
are
irreconcilable,
it's
up
to
the
supreme
court
to
say
so
and
not
us.
but
mckinney
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
is
continuous
employment.
mckinney
was
concerned
with
the
very
different
issue,
whether
the
veteran
is
entitled
to
claim
as
a
matter
of
statutory
right.
everything
that
he
would
--
the
he
probably
would've
obtained
had
he
been
“continuously
employed.”
and
here
i
can
just
put
those
words
continuously
employed
in
quotes.
mckinney
doesn't
talk
about
what
continuously
employed
means
even
though
some
of
these
benefits
that
he
probably
would've
obtained
would've
been
in
the
discretion
of
the
employer.
or,
was
the
veteran
only
entitled
to
what
he
could
have
claimed
as
a
matter
of
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
customs
of
the
parties,
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
this
was
the
position
of
the
parties.
the
mckinney
facts
indicated
that
the
employer's
discretion
was
required
for
a
promotion
that
mckinney
was
asking
that
mckinney
was
asking
for.
the
government
argued
in
behalf
of
mckinney
that
he
probably
would've
gotten
the
promotion
in
the
employer's
discretion.
the
railroad
responded,
“he
can
only
claim
it
if
it
could've
had
it
as
a
matter
of
right
had
he
been
continuously
employed.”
it
distinguish
diehl
saying
that
the
diehl
was
entirely
consistent
with
their
--
with
their
position
in
mckinney.
diehl,
the
railroad
said
was
entitled
to
the
seniority
he
claimed
as
a
matter
of
right
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mckinney
wouldn't
have
had
any
right
to
the
promotion
he
claimed
even
if
he
had
been
continuously
employed.
this
court
adopted
the
railroad's
position
in
mckinney.
oh,
that's
right,
the
railroad's
position
in
mckinney.
it
said
that
the
veteran
can
only
claim
what
have
--
what
have
been
his
as
a
matter
of
right,
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
it
continued
to
use
the
very
language
of
continuous
employment
that
this
court
had
used
in
oakley
which
had
been
interpreted
in
diehl
to
mean
continuous
--
continuous
presence
on
the
job
whenever
the
veteran
would've
had
a
right
to
work
and
it
stated
and
which
was
now
incorporated
in
9
(c)
(2).
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
intended
to
overrule
diehl.
diehl,
i
should
point
out
was
not
even
mentioned
in
mckinney.
it's
not
even
cited.
i
should
--
i'd
only
like
to
add
that
i
think
that
the
result
we
contend
for
in
this
case
is
almost
dictated
by
the
mckinney
decision
itself.
mckinney
had
an
alternative
claim
that
he
would've
been
entitled
to
his
promotion
as
a
matter
of
right
had
he
been
continuously
present
on
the
job.
this,
he
said
was
the
actual
way
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
been
interpreted
by
the
parties.
the
court
agreed
that
if
he
was
entitled
to
his
promotion
as
a
matter
of
right
and
not
discretion,
he
should
get
it
and
remand
it
to
allow
him
to
try
to
prove
that's
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
meant.
well,
what
our
veterans
are
claiming
in
this
case
is
the
improvement
in
status
that
would've
cont
--
that
they
had
a
right
to
claim
had
they
been
continuously
employed.
their
status
as
upgraded
helpers
improves
everyday
they
work.
they
move
towards
carman
everyday
they
work.
they
had
contract
rights
to
work
ahead
of
those
junior
to
them
exactly
the
same
as
mckinney's
claim,
contract
right
to
be
promoted
ahead
of
those
junior
to
him.
and
we're
just
claiming
that
they
should
be
given
the
benefits
of
those
rights.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
the
time
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
three
things
i
hope
without
to
a
great
length
and
rebuttal.
first,
i
hope
it's
clear
that
we
of
course
are
not
claiming
that
the
veteran
could
use
his
military
service
as
time
that
would
actually
satisfy
the
employer's
requirement
of
a
training
period.
he
had
to
complete
that
when
he
got
back,
i
think
justice
goldberg
stated
the
position
as
--
that
we
are
espousing
and
that
is
that
for
--
only
for
seniority
purposes,
he's
entitled
to
have
this.
in
line
with
this,
i'd
like
to
say
something
about
1948
house
bill
that
was
rejected.
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
congress
can
choose
one
bill
rather
than
another.
i
think
it's
almost
not
worth
speculating
when
they
both
are
--
when
they
both
grant
a
similar
protection
as
here.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
house
bill
would've
given
the
veteran
the
right
to
be
promoted.
not
just
have
seniority
date
reflect
the
promotion
but
to
be
promoted,
although
the
employer
only
wanted
trained
men
on
the
job.
now
that's
a
good
enough
reason
for
me
to
explain
why
the
house
bill
was
rejected.
and
another
reason
that
is
mentioned
in
the
senate
report
is
that
congress
didn't
want
to
grant
veterans
after
1948
rights
that
might
take
precedents
over
what
they've
granted
before
1948.
a
neat
way
of
avoiding
doing
that
was
to
declare
it
sense
and
its
--
and
declare
its
sense
in
terms
that
this
court
had
used
those
with
continuous
employment.
that's
my
first
point.
my
second
point
is
i
think
that
the
--
the
heart
of
the
case
can
be
stated
more
adequately
now
than
before
when
i
was
standing
up.
mckinney
definitely
holds
that
the
employee
can't
claim
what
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
employer
to
withhold
from
him.
what
would've
been
in
the
discretion
of
the
employer
to
withhold
them
had
he
not
been
--
had
he
--
even
had
he
been
present
on
the
job,
that's
certainly
the
heart
of
mckinney.
it
also
--
it
also
holds
that
the
veteran
can
claim
on
his
return
a
promotion
that
he
could've
had
on
the
basis
of
seniority
alone
had
he
been
present
on
the
job.
he
can
claim
what
he
would've
had
as
a
matter
of
right.
now,
what
this
case
is
about
--
in
--
in
this
case,
the
veterans
are
claiming
the
--
the
increase
in
status
which
comes
with
exercising
the
rights
they
had
in
their
absence
to
work
as
carmen.
justice
mckinney
exercised
--
mckinney
claimed
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right.
this
court
found
it
was
probably
discretionary
about
his
right
to
a
promotion.
these
veterans
are
claiming
the
benefits
of
the
rights
they
had
to
work
during
their
absence.
what
the
case
is
about
is
whether
--
it's
agreed
that
the
veteran
--
it's
agreed
that
veterans
can
claim
what
would've
been
theirs
as
a
matter
of
right
had
they
been
present.
it's
agreed
they
can't
claim
what
would
have
been
theirs
only
as
a
matter
of
discretion
had
they
been
present.
this
case
is
about
what
happens
to
the
acts
of
nature
that
fall
in
the
middle.
these
veterans
had
a
right
to
claim
work
on
everyday
but
they
had
no
right
not
to
be
sick
nor
it
was
not
--
sickness
was
not
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
a
matter
of
right.
what
happens
to
those
--
what
happens
to
the
things
that
could've
interfered
with
what
the
--
the
veteran
claims
but
is
not
interference
as
a
matter
of
employee
or
his
discretion.
to
that,
we
answer
that
the
diehl
case
has
said
that
if
the
only
thing
as
long
as
what
the
veteran
is
claiming
depends
only
upon
as
being
treated
as
if
he
had
worked
when
he
had
a
right
to
work,
he's
entitled
to
that.
this
we
say
is
the
holding
of
diehl.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
we
--
no,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
say
that
he
would've
obtained
any
degree
of
skill.
all
he
had
to
do
was
be
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no,
i
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
actually,
all
that
is
required
for
their
two
--
the
two
things
i
have
to
respond
to,
all
that's
required
to
do
a
day's
work
as
a
carman
for
an
upgraded
helper
is
to
perform
adequately.
in
the
memory
of
men
in
the
record,
no
one
had
ever
been
set
down
without
his
permission.
no
one
had
ever
been
taken
--
his
up
--
had
his
upgraded
work
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we've
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
we've
taken
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
it's
a
training
period,
though
--
though
all
that
is
required
to
become
a
carman
after
1040
days
is
the
1040th
day
of
work.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
right,
we've
taken
it
as
a
training
period.
i
suspect
that's
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
it
--
you
have
to
satisfactorily
perform
as
the
carman.
i
--
i
assume
that
the
only
training
is
doing
carman's
work.
its
on-the-job
training
doing
that
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
right.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
on
the
--
it
--
it
of
course
isn't
absolutely
automatic.
someone
could've
failed.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
someone
could've
been
sick.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
all.
i
think
it's
--
i
think
that
failure
to
respond
satisfactorily
is
far
less
likely
than
any
of
the
other
alternatives
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record.
it
--
the
fact
--
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
--
the
possibility
of
getting
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it's
a
work
period.
that's
right.
and
the
ultimate
question
for
this
case
is
whether
this
--
whether
an
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
i'm
beginning
to
worry
about
that
right
now
justice
white.
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
--
whether
the
fairness
of
treating
the
--
obviously
the
best
approximation
of
where
this
veteran
would've
been
had
he
not
gone
into
service
is
to
treat
them
as
if
he
had
been
work
--
at
work
when
he
had
a
right
to
work.
that's
the
best
approximation.
mckinney
tells
us
that
there
are
certain
things
that
are
ultimate
imponderables
and
that
courts
don't
speculate
on.
one
of
those
things
is
the
employers'
discretion.
now,
if
you
wanted
--
if
you
pass
the
diehl
case
which
we
say
has
decided
this,
the
question
is
whether
--
whether
that
this
court
should
come
down
on
the
side
of
avoiding,
speculating
about
the
imponderables
of
discretion,
of
sickness
and
all
those
things
or
whether
it
should
put
the
employee
where
he
would
most
likely
have
been.
when
all
that's
involved
is
the
right
to
--
the
assumption
that
the
veteran
would
have
been
at
work,
we
say
should've
come
down
on
the
side
where
he
would've
been.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
if
he
had
--
he
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
of
course
say
that
he
would
have
to
complete
a
training
period
at
the
--
before
he
could
work
in
the
status
that
--
in
any
advanced
status
because
the
employer
would
have
a
right
to
require
that
he
be
trained
before
giving
him
the
job.
the
employer
could
also
require
him
to
make
up
any
lost
grounds,
any
ground
that
he
had
lost
by
being
away
from
a
highly
specialized
field.
but,
if
the
only
statutory
--
the
only
requirement
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
advancement
between
two
positions
was
a
certain
number
of
days
of
work.
we
would
say
the
employee
should
be
treated
as
if
he
had
worked
whenever
he
had
a
right
to
work.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
this
--
this
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor.
i've
--
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
and
i'll
have
to
make
very
quickly,
and
that
is
furlough
and
leave
of
absence.
we
believe
that
the
court
was
entirely
correct
in
diehl
in
overruling
the
third
circuit
which
had
relied
on
furlough
and
leave
of
absence
for
their
decision.
furlough
and
leave
of
absence
was
added
in
this
way
in
1940.
the
bill
had
been
written
without
furlough
and
leave
of
absence
giving
in
exactly
the
way
it
is
now
at
protected
seniority
position
and
insurance
and
other
benefits.
senator
danaher
of
connecticut
and
a
number
of
congressmen
in
the
house
were
worried
about
the
protection
of
insurance
and
other
benefits.
they
said,
is
the
employer
going
to
be
paying
while
the
employee
is
away
in
service?
now
this
was
a
concern
to
them.
senator
sheppard
of
texas
responded,
“no,
the
only
insurance
and
other
benefits
that
are
protected
are
those
that
the
veteran
had
when
he
left.”
not
--
he
doesn't
get
any
increment
in
pay-type
benefits
while
he
is
away.
this
is
the
way
it
was
left
for
two
weeks
and
then
senator
davis
of
pennsylvania
came
in
with
the
--
he
said,
“let's
amend
the
statute
and
put
in
this
furlough
and
leave
of
absence
clauses.”
the
statute
--
this
was
endorsed
by
senator
sheppard,
head
of
the
armed
services
committee
who
said,
“this
is
wonderful.
now,
veterans
are
also
going
to
have
the
protection
and
the
benefits
that
are
given
absent,
employees
who
were
off
from
leave
of
absence.”
to
that
extent,
it
was
treated
--
it
was
considered
fair
to
impose
an
extra
burden
on
employers.
now,
this
just
took
--
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
very
different
question,
it
doesn't
as
a
matter
of
grammar,
it
doesn't
modify
the
seniority
provisions
or
the
position
--
provisions.
as
a
matter
of
history,
it's
a
very
different
matter
than
seniority
which
doesn't
burden
the
employer
in
any
way.
this
isn't
a
question
of
requiring
him
to
pay
for
services
he
hasn't
received
in
any
way.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
think
so
your
honor.
this
court
--
if
there's
one
thing
that's
basic
under
the
statute,
it
is
that
a
man
who
leaves
position
a
with
seniority
of
--
of
two
years
and
returns
after
three
years
of
service
--
after
three
years
of
service
gets
seniority
of
five
years
in
position
a.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
at
all.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
that
--
that
assumes
that
he
was
--
that
he
performed
his
work
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
--
satisfactorily.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
statute
should
be
implied
on
the
assumption
that
people
continue
doing
satisfactory
work
that
the
veteran
would've
continued
doing
satisfactory
work
even
if
a
sizable
proportion
did
not
do
satisfactory
work
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
--
10%,
15%.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh,
i
don't
--
that
i
don't
think
would
be
a
matter
of
discretion.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
grievance
arbitration,
wouldn't
be
on
--
certainly
wouldn't
be
in
the
employer's
discretion
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
--
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
correct.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
correct,
but
it
would
have
to
be
in
a--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
would
have
to
be
for
cause.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
you
have
to
work
satisfactorily
as
a
carman
during
this
1040
days.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
just
the
--
just
the
way
every
carman
who
continues
to
accu
--
let's
say
a
carman
went
into
service
and
came
back
and
--
and
claimed
accumulated
seniority,
his
claim
would
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
been
demoted.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
then
--
the
only
man
--
i
did
say
that
but
i
wouldn't
think
it
was
different
if
they
had
been
--
if
some
had
failed
to
do
their
job
adequately.
