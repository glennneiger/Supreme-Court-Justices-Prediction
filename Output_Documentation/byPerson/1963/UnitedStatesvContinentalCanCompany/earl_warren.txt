mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
anything
to
--
to
prevent
the
kind
of
competition
that
came
into
the
beer
business
that
mr.
solicitor
spoke
up
almost
overnight.
they
--
they
forgot
tradition
and
they
changed
from
--
from
bottles
to
cans.
and
--
and
couldn't
the
same
thing
happen
in
any
--
any
line
of
industry
if
it
was
competition
and
--
and
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturers
but
perhaps
it
might
not
exist
if
there
--
if
there
was
no
desire
to
develop
those
--
those
different
commodities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there's
no
part
because
it
just
happened
--
happened
that
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
ingenuity
of
the
manufacturer,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
sold
the
idea
and
--
and
they
gave
a
better
competition
because
of
that,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
put
these
big
companies
together,
is
there
not
a
danger
of
them
loosing
their
incentive
to
--
to
change
those
traditions
and
--
and
change
the
method
of
packaging
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
it's
easier
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
mr.
spritzer
read
a
--
a
letter
or
a
--
or
a
memorandum
or
something
to
the
effect
that
the
--
that
the
glass
industry
was
shocked
when
the
--
when
the
beer
can
appeared.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
control
both
of
them,
they
wouldn't
want
to
shock
themselves,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
a
--
how
about
a
can
of
aspirin
or
a
--
a
bottle
of
aspirin
-(voice
overlap)
-
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
sort.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
be
of
comparable
size
and
utility?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
not
necessarily
but
in
some
pretty
small
bottles
of
aspirin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
johnson,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
