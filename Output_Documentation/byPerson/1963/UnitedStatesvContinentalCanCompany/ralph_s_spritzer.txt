mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case,
brought
by
the
united
states
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
involves
the
acquisition
by
the
continental
can
company
of
the
hazel-atlas
glass
company.
the
acquisition
was
consummated
in
1956,
following
the
denial
of
a
restraining
order.
the
case
did
not
come
on
for
trial
until
june
1960,
at
which
time
it
was
heard
by
judge
frederick
bryan
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
trial
lasted
in
all
for
some
six
weeks.
during
its
course,
the
government
introduced
more
than
a
thousand
exhibits
then
presented
70
odd
witnesses.
after
the
government's
case
was
completed,
the
district
court
on
continental's
motion
dismissed
the
case
out
of
hand.
in
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
court
issued
a
brief
oral
opinion.
that
was
in
december
of
1960.
more
than
two
years
later,
in
april
of
1963,
the
court
issued
an
elaborate
opinion
of
some
80
printed
pages
which
it
said,
would
also
constitute
its
findings
of
fact.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
there
was
briefing
in
the
(inaudible)
your
honor.
the
case,
we
think,
is
one
of
large
importance.
one
striking
aspect,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
alone
is
decisive,
is
at
this
litigation
involves
the
amalgamation
of
two
national
giants.
both
of
the
companies
in
question
were
among
the
country's
500
largest
corporations.
another
aspect
which
makes
the
case
a
portentous
one
in
these
days
of
widespread
diversification
by
entry
into
the
fields
of
substitute
products
is
that
we
deal
here
very
largely
with
interindustry,
as
distinguished
from
intraindustry
competition.
indeed,
the
essence
of
the
government's
case
is
that
there
is
highly
significant
competition
between
two
reasonably
interchangeable
products,
the
tin
can
and
the
glass
container.
and
a
strong
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
acquisition
will,
in
section
7
terms,
substantially,
lessened
that
competition.
now,
i'm
not,
for
a
moment,
proposing
to
deny
that
glass
containers
and
tin
cans
have
distinguishable
characteristics,
nor
am
i
suggesting
that
each
of
them
does
not
constitute
by
itself,
an
identifiable
line
of
commerce.
surely,
if
continental
can
were
to
acquire
american
can
company
next
week,
the
antitrust
division
would
question
that
merger
and
surely
it
would
say
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
look
beyond
the
confines
of
the
can
industry
in
order
to
determine
whether
its
effects
made
such
a
merger
a
forbidden
venture.
i
think
it's
a
truism
that
whenever
there
are
two
products,
which
from
the
standpoint
of
the
users
of
those
products,
have
a
degree
of
interchangeability
or
substitutability
but
are
not
so
close
to
one
another
as
to
be
fungible
that
there's
bound
to
be
both
intraindustry
and
interindustry
competition.
in
the
economists
terms,
the
cross-elasticity
of
demand
as
between
the
two
products
will
vary
from
user
to
user.
if,
for
example,
one
packer
finds
it
advantageous
to
place
his
goods
in
a
transparent
container,
he
almost
certainly
is
going
to
use
glass
even
if
the
tin
can
maybe
somewhat
cheaper.
conversely,
a
packer
who
wants
an
opaque
container
is
surely
going
to
use
the
tin
can.
a
--
a
third
producer
who
doesn't
care
much
either
way,
may
be
guided
by
a
comparative
price.
my
example
of
course
is
an
oversimplified
one.
many
perhaps
most
users
will
consider
a
variety
of
characteristics
before
striking
a
balance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
there
are,
and
i
shall
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
true.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
refer
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
that
kind
of
competition
also.
we
take
the
du
pont
cellophane
case
that
is
suggested
one
here,
judge
bryan
found
support
for
his
judgment
in
the
comment
in
this
court's
cellophane
opinion,
i
quote
it,
"one
can
think
of
building
materials
as
in
commodity
competition,
but
one
can
hardly
say
that
brick
competes
with
steel
or
wood
or
cement
or
stone
in
the
meaning
of
sherman
act
litigation.
the
products
are
too
different."
and
judge
bryan,
as
i
say,
relied
on
that.
yet
of
course,
that
very
case,
the
cellophane
case,
held
that
du
pont's
monopoly
position
was
not
to
be
measured
solely
by
its
reference
to
its
power
vis-Ã -vis
the
other
manufacturers
of
cellophane.
but
was
to
consider
additionally,
the
manufacturers
of
glassine,
wax
paper,
pliofilm,
kraft
paper
and
various
other
flexible
packaging
materials,
albeit,
those
materials
had
differing
qualities
and
characteristics.
now,
whether
or
not
cellophane's
distinguishing
characteristics
should
have
led
to
the
conclusion,
as
the
government
argued
in
that
case,
that
it
might
be
separately
monopolized,
no
one
would
question,
i
take
it,
that
cellophane
and
the
principle
substitutes
with
which
it
competes
would
also
constitute
a
relevant
market
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
particularly
under
section
7,
which
relates
to
any
line
of
commerce
and
which
this
court
had
said,
reaches
among
other
things,
even
conglomerate
mergers.
now,
i
think
the
first
step
in
evaluating
competition
between
products
has
to
be
an
assessment
of
their
general
characteristics
and
uses.both
cans
and
jars
of
course
are
rigid
containers
and
both
are
impermeable.
this
makes
them
susceptible
of
uses
for
packaging
an
infinite
variety
of
items
which
come
in
liquid,
solid
or
even
gaseous
form.
it
permits
packaging
in
a
way
that
will
make
the
content
secure
from
injury
or
deterioration.
in
addition,
both
types
of
containers
are
capable
of
being
heated
to
relatively
high
temperatures
and
accordingly,
both
are
used
as
--
all
of
us
are
aware
in
great
quantities,
in
the
important
food
canning
industry,
in
which
of
course,
the
process
of
preparation
involves
sterilization
by
heat,
followed
by
hermetic
sealing.
a
leading
food
scientist
too
was
called
as
a
witness,
testified
that
there
are
no
comparable
containers
from
the
standpoint
of
preventing
food
spoilage.
now,
to
be
sure,
there
are
also
significant
differences
between
cans
and
glass
containers,
the
cans
for
one
thing,
are
less
bulky,
lighter
in
weight
although
the
record
here
shows
that
the
glass
industry,
conscious
of
this
competitive
factor,
has
made
important
strives
in
making
ware
which
both
lighter
and
stronger
than
the
traditional
glass
container.
witness
the
throwaway
beer
bottle,
which
of
course
competes
actively
with
the
beer
can.
another
difference
is
that
glass
is
chemically
inert.
it
won't
react
with
the
contents
placed
therein.
tin
plate
on
the
other
hand,
will
react
with
various
substances,
a
problem
which
the
can
manufacturers
meet
for
their
part
by
using
a
particular
type
of
lining
or
coating
when
the
can
is
designed
for
certain
end
uses.
of
course
for
many
end
uses,
the
same
kind
of
can
is
acceptable.
the
same
type
will
be
used
for
foods,
for
human
consumption,
for
pet
foods
and
indeed
for
motor
oil.
now
as
to
the
relative
cost
of
the
two
types
of
containers
from
the
customer's
standpoint,
it
is
difficult
to
generalize.
probably,
glass
is
the
more
expensive,
more
often
than
not
but
this
varies
considerably
from
case-to-case.
for
example,
the
soft
drink
can
and
the
beer
can
are
somewhat
costlier
than
the
bottle.
this
results
from
the
fact
that
those
cans
have
to
be
specially
sealed
at
the
seams
in
order
to
resist
the
pressures
of
the
beverage
and
this
makes
them
costlier
to
make.
an
important
factor
from
the
cost
standpoint
is
whether
the
user
will
incur
added
costs
by
using
one
type
of
container
rather
than
the
other.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
anything
like
perfect
competition.
we
say
that
there
is
a
considerable
degree,
a
high
degree
of
cross-elasticity
for
many
end
uses
and
that
establishes
competition
between
them
in
the
same
way
that
cellophane
was
found
to
be
in
competition
with
other
products
or
be
it
cellophane
was
used
exclusively
for
some
end
uses,
such
as
cigarette
packaging.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
shall
indeed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
--
i
know
the
one
your
honor
means.
at
this
point,
i
want
to
do
on
the
subject
of
price
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
an
exhibit
which
appears
in
volume
3
at
record
2531,
which
is
an
exhibit
from
continental
can's
files.
in
its
headed
competition
of
glass
versus
tin
and
it
begins
by
saying
that
attached
are
data
sheets,
summarizing
information
received
from
division
offices
on
the
comparative
cost
of
tin
and
glass
containers
for
the
following
products,
and
it
lists
a
number
of
them.
then
further
down,
continental
observes
in
general,
the
glass
package
is
less
expensive
to
the
packer
of
non-processed
food
items.
the
closure
cost
of
the
jar
makes
the
glass
package
more
expensive
for
processed
food.
and
then
on
the
next
page,
continental
can
illustrates
this
by
referring
various
types
of
--
various
commodities
which
are
packaged
in
the
two
containers.
it
says,
"for
processed
foods
from
a
price
standpoint,
we
are
in
a
favorable
position
and
consumer
preference
will
dictate
how
much
goes
in
glass."
on
baby
food
it
says,
"our
baby
food
can
prices
would
seem
to
offer
attraction
to
the
packer
to
use
tin
but
the
customers
here
appear
to
prefer
glass."
on
insecticides,
they
say
the
packer
seems
to
prefer
tin
but
should
our
can
prices
further
increase,
the
lower
cost
of
glass
may
offer
a
saving
which
the
buyer
cannot
afford
to
pass
up.
on
instant
coffee,
they
observed,
"we
will
have
to
guard
against
any
material
increase
in
the
price
of
our
soluble
coffee
if
we
want
to
make
in
droves
on
the
glass
container
volume.
vacuum-packed
coffee,
the
continental
fears
--
feels
its
position
is
secure.
ovaltine,
it
says,
we
have
priced
ourselves
out
of
this
market,
similarly,
in
the
case
of
backing
soda.
and
then
on
syrup
it
says,
"we
are
not
competitive
with
glass
and
are
losing
business
on
that
item."
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
2531
and
2,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
also
in
the
record,
a
chart,
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
deal
with
it
but
it
is
at
record
2548,
which
is
a
graph
prepared
by
owens-illinois,
the
largest
manufacturer
of
glass
containers
which
undertook
price
comparisons,
glass
versus
tin
and
that
graph
shows
that
on
some,
the
can
is
costlier
on
some
of
the
glasses.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
they
were
discovered
during
the
course
of
pretrial
discovery.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
what
i
just
read
you
is
the
continental
can
memorandum
from
its
files.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
what
now
referring
to
is
from
owens
--
came
from
owens-illinois.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right.
the
significant
fact
here,
as
to
the
matter
of
price,
and
this
much
one
can
generalize
is
that
that
the
differentials
are
relatively
small.
they're
nowhere
near
the
differences.
for
example,
that
one
had
in
the
cellophane
case,
whereas
your
honors
will
recall,
cellophane
ran
from
more
than
twice
to
more
than
seven
times
as
much
as
some
of
the
various
materials
found
to
be
competitive
with
it.
now,
of
course,
the
tin
cans
and
the
glass
containers
come
in
all
forms,
shapes
and
sizes
but
all
that
needs
to
be
said
on
that
score
is
that
the
major
companies
are
quite
capable
of
making
them
in
all
forms,
shapes
and
sizes
and
to
ship
very
rapidly
to
meet
any
orders
which
could
they
could
obtain.
let
me
now
shift
the
focus
a
moment
from
the
characteristics
of
the
two
products
to
the
characteristics
of
the
two
industries
and
the
two
companies
involved.
according
to
figures
accepted
by
the
court,
the
can
industry,
in
1957,
produced
over
41
billion
tin
cans
and
the
glass
industry,
over
18
billion
glass
containers,
a
total
of
approximately
60
billion
and
a
ratio
of
more
than
2
to
1,
little
more
than
2
to
1
in
favor
of
the
can.
now,
we
had
roughly
150
million
people
in
this
country
in
the
1950s
which
would
mean
that
approximately
400
tin
cans
or
glass
containers
were
being
made
for
each
man,
woman
and
child.
about
one-half
of
the
glass
and
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
tin
cans
went
into
one
form
or
another
of
a
food
container,
using
food
in
its
broadest
sense.
that
incidentally,
is
an
area
in
which
hazel-atlas
had
always
been
particularly
active,
the
food
containers
for
food
products.
it
was
not
so
active.
it
was
relatively
small
in
soft
drinks
and
beer.
it
was
also
active
in
making
containers
for
the
drug,
toiletry,
cosmetics,
industries,
and
for
household
and
industrial
products,
but
food
was
perhaps
its
biggest
field
of
concentration.
now,
who
makes
these
40
billion
odd
cans?
the
court
found
that
american
can,
the
leader,
had
approximately
38%
of
that
market
and
that
continental
had
approximately
33%.
so
the
two
leading
can
companies
have
over
70%
of
the
market,
not
surprisingly,
the
economists
have
cited
this
as
a
prime
example
of
duopoly.
not
surprisingly,
the
indications
in
the
record
are
that
price
changes
within
its
industry,
took
a
follow-the-leader
pattern.continental
itself
was
organized
in
1913.
it
had
a
rapid
growth
in
part
as
a
result
of
internal
expansion
and
part
is
a
result
of
acquisitions
of
which
it
made
more
than
40.
it
operates
some
70
plants,
more
than
40
of
them
in
can
manufacture.
after
its
acquisition
of
hazel-atlas
in
1956,
it
had
annual
net
sales
and
operating
revenues
of
more
than
a
billion
dollars.
turning
to
the
glass
industry,
the
leading
company
is
owens-illinois.
it
had
about
35%
of
the
total
production
of
glass
containers.
anchor-hocking
was
second
with
about
12%
and
hazel-atlas,
third
with
slightly
under
10%.
hereto,
the
picture
is
one
of
concentration,
though
not
as
great.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
i
think,
it
probably
would
be
in
the
realm
of
4%
or
5%
your
honor,
though
to
give
you
exact
figure.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there,
i
don't
think
there
are
exact
percentages
for
the
entire
industry
your
honor.
there
are
indications
from
which
i
think
one
can
infer
that
there's
a
drop
to
that
4%
or
5%.
that
leaves
three
companies
with
approximately
57%
of
that
industry.
hazel-atlas
was
organized
about
the
turn
of
the
century.
it
was
one
of
the
pioneers
in
the
glass
industry.
it
grew
steadily.
it
was
consistently
profitable
until
its
acquisition.
what
its
production
is
today,
we
don't
know
from
the
record.
we
do
know
that
in
1955,
hazel-atlas
produced
in
one
and
three-quarter
billion
glass
containers.
in
1957,
the
first
full
year
after
the
acquisition,
its
production
was
down
140
million
units,
although
the
totals
for
the
industry
were
off.
those
figures
are
at
record
2968.
now,
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
is
keen
competition
for
markets
by
the
glass
companies.
as
with
cans,
however,
it
appears
that
the
price
structure
is
a
rigid
one
and
is
determined
by
the
industry
leaders.
this
point
was
succinctly
made
by
the
test
--
in
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
glenshaw
glass
who
testified
at
record
394
that
his
company
cannot
charge
anymore
than
owens-illinois
and
certainly,
wouldn't
take
any
less.
other
glass
manufacturers
testified
to
like
effect.
now,
i
emphasized
this
lack
of
vigorous
price
competition
with
in
each
of
the
two
industries
because
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
in
such
industries,
the
role
of
the
competition
provided
by
substitute
products
is
of
particular
importance
to
the
company.
now,
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
competition,
the
--
both
active
and
potential,
between
glass
and
can,
extends
over
a
wide
range
of
categories.
we
suggest,
therefore,
that
the
most
meaningful
line
of
commerce
in
which
to
appraise
the
effects
of
this
merger
is
the
production
and
sale
of
containers
for
all
of
the
many
purposes
for
which
metal
and
glass
containers
may
both
be
used,
including
particularly,
beverages,
foods,
household
and
chemical
goods,
cosmetic
and
drugs.
in
the
district
court,
the
government
urged
that
the
merger
would
adversely
affect
the
entire
packaging
industry
and
both
the
can
and
the
glass
industries.
in
addition,
we
urged
that
the
merger
would
impair
competition
in
numerous
submarkets,
for
example,
the
market
for
containers
provided
by
food
canners.
we've
dealt
with
that
food
canning
submarket
in
our
brief
but
our
primary
emphasis
and
i
shall
confine
myself
to
it
here,
is
to
the
composites
that
i
have
described,
the
uses
for
which
--
the
end
uses
for
which
these
containers
compete.
now,
i
--
i
do
note
in
passing,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
earlier,
that
plastics
and
paper
containers
are
also
to
a
degree
in
the
broad
market
represented
by
the
end
uses
of
cans
and
glass
containers,
that's
toiletries,
cosmetics,
drugs
are
not
in
frequently
found
in
the
plastic
tube
or
container.
however,
the
record
does
show
that
for
most
of
the
purposes
for
which
glass
and
metal
are
used,
they
alone
are
practicable.
the
time
of
the
merger
moreover,
the
total
business
in
the
plastic
field
was
about
$30
million
as
compared
to
sales
of
well
over
two
billion
for
glass
and
tin
cans.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
frankly,
i
haven't
looked
at
our
proceedings
in
that
case,
your
honor.
that
is
pending
which
is
all
i
--
i
know
about
it,
but
i
don't
know
that
it's
developed
to
the
point
where
--
where
i
could
say
what
the
proof
shows
or
what
the
government's
ultimate
theory
is.
now,
the
district
court
did
address
itself,
to
this
question
of
inter
--
interindustry
competition
and
its
focus
follows
at
record
1603
and
1604.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
continental
can
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
has
both
plastic
and
paper.
it's
going
into
those
businesses
by
other
acquisitions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
hazel-atlas
was
exclusively
a
glass
company.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
district
court
stated
on
this
matter
of
interindustry
competition,
hazel-atlas
and
continental
were
part
of
an
overall
industrial
pattern,
each
in
a
recognized
separate
industry
producing
distinct
products
but
engaged
in
interindustry
competition
for
the
favor
of
various
end-users
of
their
products.
at
another
point,
it
said
this
interindustry
competition
was
substantial,
but
the
court
then
proceeded
to
hold
that
this
was
insufficient
to
make
such
products
which
it
repeated,
came
from
separate
and
distinct
industries,
a
line
of
commerce
for
section
7
purposes.
and
that
is
our
basic
quarrel
with
the
decision
below.
we
suggest
that
the
court
had
an
erroneous
and
two
exacting,
a
view.
that
it
believed
apparently,
that
there
must
be
substantial
parody
or
equivalents
between
the
substitute
products
in
order
for
the
competition
to
be
protected
by
the
clayton
act.
i
infer
this
from
its
constant
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
industries
are
separate.
from
its
preoccupation
with
the
fact
that
variables
enter
into
the
buyer's
choice
whether
it
take
a
can
or
a
glass
container
for
his
packaging
needs
from
its
reliance
upon
the
steel
versus
wood
language
of
the
cellophane
opinion
to
which
i
referred
earlier.
and
finally,
from
some
of
the
comments
to
which
i
shall
soon
refer,
which
it
made
in
connection
with
the
evidence
offered
at
the
trial.
now,
it's
not
--
i
repeat,
our
contention
that
there
is
anything
like
perfect
or
plastic
competition
between
these
two
differing
products.
we
do
say
that
there
is
substantial
or
be
it
imperfect
competition
that
each
product
exercises
a
significant
limiting
force
upon
the
price
which
the
other
can
command
as
indeed,
each
of
the
industries
as
acutely
aware
that
these
limitations
are
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
two
industries,
each
of
which
is
concentrated
and
characterized
by
a
lack
of
strenuous
internal
price
competition
and
that
the
preservation
of
this
interindustry
competition
is
within
the
purposes
of
section
7.
now,
one
of
preliminary
ways
in
which
the
government
showed
that
cans
and
glass
containers
are
reasonably
interchangeable,
this
was
a
rough
and
preliminary
line
of
proof
but
we
think,
persuasive
nonetheless,
was
by
sending
investigators
into
various
retail
establishments
in
numerous
cities,
into
grocery
stores,
drugstores,
supermarkets.
they
surveyed
what
was
on
the
shelves,
making
appropriate
notations
whenever
they
saw
that
same
item
or
type
of
item
in
both
can
and
glass.
as
a
sample,
i
should
refer
your
honors
to
the
alphabetical
listing
at
record
3123
in
volume
4,
which
was
made
up
by
fbi
agents
who
went
to
a
series
of
los
angeles
stores.
and
you'll
find
there
about
five
or
six
pages
of
items.
under
(a)
for
example,
you'll
find
among
others
ammonia,
anchovies,
antiseptics,
apple
sauce,
apricots,
artichokes,
asparagus,
aspirin
and
goes
on
for
pages.
some
of
the
lists
prepared
by
the
fbi
agents
are
more
detailed,
giving
sizes
or
brands
or
prices
of
the
items
as
well.
now,
continental
can
attacks
these
surveys.
it
says
they
take
insufficient
account
of
material
differences.
for
example,
in
cross
examining,
one
of
the
fbi
agents
who
had
noted
on
his
list
that
nescafe
which
is
a
soluble
or
instant
coffee
was
put
up
in
both
bottles
and
in
cans.
continental's
lawyers
brought
out
quite
properly
on
cross-examination
that
nescafe
in
the
tin
was
an
after-dinner
style
coffee
and
not
so
in
the
glass
jar.
also,
that
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
price
between
the
two
varieties.
the
fact
that
the
contents
were
not
the
same
is
--
is
relevant.
the
point
remains,
however,
in
our
view,
that
if
the
instant
coffee,
whether
french
after-dinner
style
or
american
garden
variety,
can
be
packed
in
either
tins
or
in
glass
but
it
does
show
that
the
packer
has
a
substantial
alternative
or
choice.
judge
bryan,
however,
agreed
with
the
appellees.
he
stated
that
since
the
nescafe
was
of
two
different
varieties,
the
evidence
that
was
packed
in
two
different
containers
and
i
quote
him,
"had
no
probative
value,
none
whatsoever."
and
that
appears
on
record
1053.
now,
this
is
an
indication
of
what
i
meant
when
i
suggested
earlier
that
the
district
judge
appeared
to
us
to
have
rather
an
elastic
views
on
cross-elasticity.
perhaps,
this
point
is
--
is
worth
illustrating
further.
the
defendants
took
the
same
fbi
agent
to
test
because
he
reported
seeing
olives
in
both
jars
and
in
tins.
their
point
again
and
perfectly
a
proper
one
was
that
green
olives
were
always
found
in
glass
and
black
olives
were
always
found
in
the
tin.
again,
however,
i
think
one
is
fairly
left
with
the
conviction
that
packers
of
olives,
whether
green
or
ripe,
must
have
a
significant
choice.
nonetheless
again,
the
district
court
--
court
agreed
with
appellees
and
said
that
this
evidence
had
no
relevance
at
record
1055.
to
this,
i
add
the
footnote
that
if
you
go
to
the
delicate
test
and
order,
the
supermarket
today,
you
can
find
black
olives
in
jars
as
well
as
in
tins.
indeed,
you
can
find
black
and
green
olives
in
the
same
jar,
in
the
so-called
banquet
assortment.
i
don't
offer
this
testimony
to
supplement
the
record
but
i
do
make
the
point
that
it
is
not
unfitting
in
administering
a
statute
which
calls
for
an
element
of
prediction
to
take
into
account
that
which
is
plausible
,if
not,
indeed
are
fixed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
this
illustrates
the
--
the
fact
that
you
can
see
the
same
product
in
both.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you
don't
have
good
statistical
data
on
this,
your
honor
because
the
same
standard-sized
glass
jar,
10
million
of
them,
may
be
shipped
by
owens-illinois
to
heinz
company
or
to
the
anp
and
then
they
use
that
same
jar
for
50
different
uses.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
the
continental
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
let
me
come
right
to
that
because
this
is
an
exhibit
prepared
by
continental,
your
honor,
not
the
government
exhibit.
it
was
prepared
--
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
rely
on
it
nonetheless.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
let
me
--
let
me
explain.
the
government
had
called
the
staff
director
of
the
glass
--
glass
container
manufacturers
institute
to
the
stand
as
its
witness,
that's
portrayed
at
the
glassmakers
trade
association,
and
he
identified
many
documents,
he
testified
as
an
expert.
on
cross-examination,
continental
can
prepared
a
list
of
items,
the
list
which
you
see
before
you
on
pages
26
to
29
and
then
asked
this
witness
to
estimate
on
the
basis
of
his
expert
knowledge
how
much
of
each
of
this
listed
items
went
into
glass
and
how
much
went
into
tin
cans.
he
did
so.
now,
continental
suggests
that
indicates
a
lack
of
product
interchangeability
and
i
submit
that
it
suggests
to
the
contrary.
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
the
list
shows
to
be
sure
that
as
to
most
of
the
items
packaged,
one
of
the
two
types
of
containers
is
markedly
predominant.
yet,
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
note
that
of
all
of
the
commodities
listed,
and
these
were
selected
and
listed
by
continental.
all
of
the
--
of
all
of
the
commodities
listed
on
these
four
pages,
it
is
said
of
only
one
item,
paint,
that
none
of
it
is
packaged
in
glass.
and
it
is
said,
of
only
one
item,
salad
dressing,
that
none
of
it
is
packaged
in
tin
cans.
in
all
other
instances
where
the
witness
uses
the
word,
all,
he
follows
it
by
the
words,
"or
substantially
all."
now,
i
have
little
doubt
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
packers
tend
to
--
to
move
in
packs,
to
adopt
similar
packaging
techniques
and
marketing
techniques
until
one
enterprising
company
breaks
the
pattern.
for
example,
at
one
time,
your
honors,
100%
of
all
baby
foods
came
in
cans,
then
hazel-atlas
initiated
the
glass
jar
for
baby
foods,
and
ultimately,
glass
took
over
80%
of
that
market.
i
suggest
to
you
that
even
if
98%
or
99%
of
a
particular
commodity
is
found
in
glass
or
98%
or
99%
in
tin,
the
1%
or
2%
remaining
is
highly
significant
because
it
--
it
shows
that
there
is
an
option,
an
alternative
way
of
packaging.
it
shows
that
there
are
some
competition
already
present
and
not
merely
an
overhang.
take
soft
drinks
for
example,
which
is
on
this
list.
now,
our
friends
had
exact
figures
on
that.
it
show
--
and
the
list
shows
98.5%
in
bottles
and
1.5%
in
cans.
is
that
1.5%
insignificant?
i
can
say
unequivocally
to
your
honors
that
this
record
shows
that
when
the
soft
drink
can
came
on
the
market,
the
glass
industry
was
alarmed.
the
glass
manufactures
and
their
trade
association,
gcmi,
undertook
a
most
vigorous
campaign
to
counteract
this
threat.
and
i
can
tell
you
also
from
the
record
that
the
counterpart
association,
the
can
manufacturers
institute,
undertook
a
vigorous
campaign
including
institutional
advertising
at
a
cost
of
millions
of
dollars
to
convince
the
public
of
the
attractiveness
of
the
soft
drink
can.
let
me
turn
now
from
what
can
be
seen
on
the
supermarket
shelves
to
some
items
of
evidence
which
reflect
the
attitude
of
those
who
buy
and
use
containers.
one
such
witness
was
the
director
of
purchasing
of
linens
'n
things,
a
large
toiletries
and
cosmetics
concern.
he
testified
that
for
many
items
packaged
by
his
company,
metal
and
glass
represent
practical
alternative
and
that
the
comparative
prices
of
the
two
are
significant,
though
not
necessarily
crucial
in
the
company's
choice.
he
said
this
was
especially
so
in
the
case
of
low
cost
items
because
as
to
such
items,
the
cost
of
the
container
might
be
15%
or
20%
of
the
total
price
of
the
article.
several
small
vegetable
packers
testified
that
until
1955
or
1956,
they
had
canned
all
of
their
produce
in
tin,
at
which
point,
they
begun
to
put
a
portion
in
glass.
now,
our
opponents
criticized
this
evidence
because
they
say
these
packers
are
small
and
insignificant
companies.
they
were
chosen,
however,
because
they
were
small.
if
two
little
vegetable
canners
find
it
within
their
means
to
switch
readily
from
an
old
tin
line
to
a
tin
and
glass
line,
it
is
the
more
evident
that
there
is
flexibility
and
that
the
cost
of
the
switch-over,
are
not
prohibitive.
incidentally,
one
of
these
vegetable
packers
that
estimated
his
cost
of
putting
in
the
glass
line
at
$2000,
the
other
at
$3000
to
$5000,
and
that
testimony
is
at
record
466
and
474.
now,
i
think
perhaps,
most
revealing
is
what
the
glass
manufacturers
and
the
can
manufacturers
themselves
have
said
and
done.
i
suggest
that
this
record
shows
that
they
are
as
keenly
conscious
of
the
competition
of
the
other
as
the
manufacturers
of
olive
oil
or
butter.
now,
gcmi,
the
trade
association
to
which
i
earlier
referred,
had
numerous
industry-manned
committees,
one
important
one
was
the
marketing
committee.
correspondence
and
minutes
of
that
committee
and
its
staff
appear
at
length
in
the
record.
i'll
have
time
to
note
that
one
or
two
items.
one
of
these
is
the
letter
at
record
1659
in
which
the
staff
director
of
the
marketing
committee
reports
that
continental
can
had
putout
information
implying
that
glass
chips
may
find
their
way
into
baby
food.
and
further,
the
continental
can
had
exaggerated
the
cost
saving
which
might
be
affected
by
putting
baby
food
in
cans.
he
describes
this
display
of
competition
as
really
vicious.
perhaps,
the
most
suggestive
activity
of
the
gcmi
marketing
committee
is
that
it
continually
conducted
studies
and
surveys
concerning
the
competition
being
experienced
by
glass
and
suggested
ways
and
means
by
which
glass
sales
could
be
expanded
at
the
expense
of
that
competition.
you
will
find,
again,
i
won't
take
the
time
to
go
over
it,
a
chart
in
one
of
these
gcmi
reports
that
appears
at
record
1757
and
1758,
which
lists
numerous
categories
of
items
which
are
put
up
in
glass
and
makes
note
of
those
items
on
which
there
is
competition
for
metal.
gcmi
estimated
that
it
was
experiencing
such
competition
on
more
than
half
of
the
items
listed
--
listed
and
that
there
was
potential
competition
on
others.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
am
conceding
your
honor
that
there
is
intraindustry
as
well
as
interindustry
competition
as
i
said
at
the
outset.
i
wouldn't
have
any
question
that
continental
can
acquired
american
can
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
look
beyond
the
can
industry.
that
that
does
not
indicate,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
not
a
broader
area
of
competition,
which
if
one
can
prove
it
is
threatened
with
impairment,
is
also
entitled
to
protection
under
the
clayton
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
one
must
always
show
that
there
is
significant
competition
if
the
--
if
the
court
was
right,
if
the
district
court
was
right
in
this
case,
in
suggesting
that
metals
and
glass
containers
are
like
steel
and
wood,
then
i
would
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
some
remote
competition
would
not
suffice.
i'm
attempting
to
put
meat
on
the
court's
finding
that
there
was
substantial
interindustry
competition.if
one
does
that,
i
think
one
is
led
to
the
conclusion
that
this
substantial
interindustry
competition
does
delineate
a
significant
line
of
commerce.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
one
must
determine
in
each
case,
whether
the
cross-elasticity
of
demand
is
such,
that
there
is
significant
competition.
i
think
the
clayton
act
is
flexible.
i
don't
think
it
should
be
stretched
or
narrowed
capriciously
on
the
--
i
--
that's
why
i'm
making
the
burden
of
my
argument
and
attempt
to
show
that
there
is
realistically,
the
most
vital
kind
of
competition
for
many
uses
between
the
two
products
with
which
we
here
deal.
and
i'd
like
to
turn
you
now
to
what
some
of
the
manufacturers
themselves
have
said
about
this
competition.
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
owens-illinois,
in
his
testimony,
spoke
of
the
shock
which
the
glass
companies
experienced
when
tomato
juice
first
appeared
in
a
can.
he
also
confirmed
the
fact
that
his
company
in
establishing
price
for
its
glass
containers
takes
into
account
the
price
of
tin
plates
and
of
metal
containers.
i
don't
know
whether
steel
manufacturers
take
into
account
reinforced
concrete
but
the
president
of
owens-illinois
says
they
do
take
that
into
account.
that's
at
record
97.
coming
still
closer
to
home,
i'd
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
refer
to
another
exhibit
from
continental
can's
files.
this
is
in
volume
3,
beginning
at
record
2553
and
this
i
think
is
an
important
and
very
suggestive
exhibit.
you
will
find
on
2553,
the
picture
of
a
design
of
a
new
type
of
can
which
continental
had
developed,
a
can
with
a
screw
on
top
that
made
it
easily
reusable
and
which
was
given
the
name
"saver
lock,"
the
saver
lock
can.
this
exhibit
is
literature
of
continental's
can
which
had
put
out
apparently
to
its
own
personnel
to
acquaint
them
with
this
new
development
and
to
enable
them
to
sell
it
to
customers.
now,
continental
says,
"these
containers
have
been
designed
to
meet
the
specific
needs
of
many
products
now
being
marketed
in
glass."
going
on,
turning
to
2556,
it
says,
"prospect
to
our
comparing
the
merits
of
saver
locked
cans
versus
glass
jars
will
find
that
the
adoption
of
the
saver
locked
can
will
enable
them
realize
substantial
savings."
then
it
illustrates
that
by
many
specific
illustrations.
it
says
at
2558,
"no
attempt
will
be
made
here
to
list
all
of
the
product
candidates
for
saver
locked
cans
as
almost
any
powdered
or
granulated
product
food
or
non-food
is
a
possibility."
it
illustrates
by
saying
that
the
saver
locked
can
ought
to
offer
an
opportunity
to
takeover
the
instant
coffee
or
a
portion
of
it
from
glass
jars.
that
the
saver
locked
can
should
be
very
interesting
to
the
concerns
looking
for
a
superior
package
to
compete
with
glass
jars
in
packaging
dry
milk.
it
should
be
a
powerful
merchandising
vehicle
for
those
products
which
are
now
packaged
principally
in
glass,
in
the
sweetening
or
syrup
field.
it
says
that
it
should
be
an
excellent
container
for
pharmaceuticals
like
boric
acid,
epsom
salt,
aspirin
tablets
and
vitamins,
all
of
course,
usually
in
--
in
glass.
and
it
concludes
by
stating,
summing
up
information
which
will
show
--
and
i
quote,
which
will
show
that
packer
that
is,
"that
conversion
of
the
glass
jar
line
to
a
saver
locked
can
line
is
relatively
simple
and
inexpensive."
it
seems
to
me
that
one
cannot
possibly
fail
to
recognize
the
keen
consciousness
of
competition
as
between
these
industries.
to
complete
the
picture,
perhaps
i
should
take
a
moment
to
refer
to
a
few
exhibits
in
hazel-atlas
pre-merger.
at
the
beginning
of
volume
4,
starting
at
page
2821,
are
theories
of
several
letters
which
came
from
field
officers
of
hazel-atlas
to
the
headquarters.
in
1953,
there
had
been
a
general
7.75%
price
increase
on
glass
containers
and
the
letter
at
2821,
reports
that
some
of
the
canners
are
--
two
can
companies
are
resisting
this
increase,
as
to
food
packers.
and
the
writer
says
that
these
companies
said
that
they
would
cut
down
on
the
use
of
glass
as
it
would
be
too
far
out
of
line
with
the
cost
of
their
tin
package,
if
this
price
increase
were
put
fully
into
effect.
the
next
exhibit
in
similar
vain,
shows
the
field
man
of
hazel-atlas
reporting,
one
of
our
syrup
accounts
is
in
sense
to
the
price
increase
and
said
that
any
business
that
could
be
swung
over
to
tin
would
be
fully
explored.
the
next
exhibit
at
2824
reports,
again,
a
letter
from
the
field
to
the
main
office,
that
a
group
of
merchants
in
the
food
packing
line
had
grouped
together
as
an
association
to
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
recent
price
advance
made
by
most
of
the
glass
companies.
they
were
all
working
along
a
certain
line
to
try
to
get
some
of
the
glass
companies
to
rescind
as
advanced
or
turn
to
some
other
kind
of
packaging.
assuming
as
i
do,
that
the
government's
evidence
which
was
all
i
emphasized,
the
district
court
had
before
it
when
it
undertook
to
dismiss
this
case
that
it
required
the
conclusion
that
there
was
very
significant
competition
between
glass
and
can.
there
remains
the
question,
and
on
this
issue
to
the
district
court
found
against
the
government,
there
remains
the
question
whether
the
disappearance
of
hazel-atlas
says,
an
independent
company
may
substantially
impair
that
competition.
the
district
court
said,
even
assuming
there's
a
line
of
commerce,
i
find
no
showing
of
injury.
i've
already
mentioned
that
hazel-atlas
was
one
of
the
pioneers
of
this
industry,
of
the
glass
industry,
and
a
company
of
very
formidable
size.
continental
can
of
course,
is
one
of
the
true
giants
with
roughly
a-third
of
the
can
market.
perhaps
the
most
vital
competition
which
bears
upon
these
two
oligopolistic
industries
is
the
cross-competition
between
them.
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
big
three
of
each
of
these
industries
got
together,
that
american
can
and
anchor-hocking
say
--
the
national
can
and
owens-illinois,
that
they
follow
the
pack
of
continental
can
and
hazel-atlas.
how
vigorously
would
these
two
industries
then
seek
to
penetrate
each
others'
markets
and
engage
in
price
competition?
let
me
note
only
that
three
such
mergers
would
represent
70%
of
the
combined
production
of
these
two
industries.
the
single
merger
with
which
we
deal
here,
results
in
an
aggregation
of
more
than
25%
of
their
combined
production.
this
merger
obviously
represents
far
more
than
a
small
start.
only
a
few
weeks
ago
of
course,
this
court
dealt
with
a
consolidation
of
the
first
and
fourth
largest
banks
in
fayette
county,
kentucky.
it
expressed
the
view
that
at
least
where
two
companies
are
major
competitive
factors
in
a
relevant
market,
the
elimination
of
competition
as
between
them
by
itself,
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
i
need
notch
the
debate,
the
requirement
of
the
sherman
act
under
which
the
government
normally
has
a
much
heavier
burden.
it
is
enough
here,
we
think,
to
point
out
that
we
are
dealing
with
much,
much
more
important
competition
than
was
involved
in
the
lexington,
kentucky
area.
competition
between
two
of
the
major
companies
in
a
great
national
market
and
that
the
charge
here
is
laid
under
the
prophylactic
provisions
of
the
clayton
act,
on
that
we
rest.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
just
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
mr.
johnson
asked
how
i
was
able
to
state
to
the
court
that
the
record
shows
a
narrow
differential
or
relatively
narrow
differential
in
the
price
as
between
tin
cans
and
glass
containers.
apart
from
the
numerous
statements
in
memorandum
of
companies
like
the
continental
can
and
hazel-atlas
company
which
discussed
the
danger
of
shift
in
business
if
price
is
altered.
there
are
other
exhibits
which
indicate
that
the
range
of
differential
is
relatively
narrow.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
study
made
of
can
versus
glass
by
owens-illinois
which
is
in
the
record
at
2458.
that
gives
in
graphic
form
relative
prices
for
beer,
detergents,
polish,
vegetables,
baby
food,
coffee
and
aerosol,
a
wide
range
of
the
general
categories
of
product
for
which
the
containers
are
used.
the
prices
which
appear
on
that
graph
give
the
figures
the
price
per
gross,
per
144.
for
example,
in
vegetables
in
the
26
ounce
size
down
in
the
right
hand
corner,
it
would
appear
that
the
price
is
roughly
judging
by
that
graph
about
$8
of
gross
for
the
can
and
about
$9
of
gross
for
the
glass.
now,
mr.
johnson
stated
to
the
court
that
he
find
has
no
difficulty
in
observing
the
existence
of
direct
competition
as
between
milk
bottles
and
the
plastic
containers
in
which
milk
is
sold.
but
the
competition
which
he
finds
typical
of
that
between
glass
and
metal
cans
is
said
to
be
tangential
or
indirect.
i
find
this
astonishing
because
one
can
go
to
the
supermarket
shelves
as
to
the
investigators
in
this
case
and
list
dozens
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
items
which
appeared
side-by-side
in
glass
and
in
metal
cans,
but
i
go
further
than
that.
one
can
find
the
same
manufacturer
putting
the
self
same
item
in
both
so
as
to
get
the
customers
who
like
it
in
glass
and
the
customers
who
like
it
in
can.
we
had
in
this
record
the
testimony
of
one
such
packer,
a
fairly
large
company
which
packs
various
types
of
apple
products
known
as
the
muscle
man
company.
their
purchasing
agent
testified.
he
said
that
his
company
puts
the
following
items
in
both
cans
and
glasses,
the
self
same
item.
apple
sauce,
spiced
apple
rings,
apple
based
jellies,
apple
butter,
apple
juice
and
the
sorted
pie
fillings.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
testimony
appears
at
record
479
and
following
the
witnesses
name
brown.
mr.
johnson
asks
how
we
know
that
for
most
uses,
as
i
put
it
in
my
opening
argument,
glass
and
metal
alone
are
practicable.
well,
it
was
testified
and
without
contradiction
by
a
food
expert
that
for
purposes
of
food
canning,
these
are
the
only
containers
that
can
be
used.
there
is
also
a
testimony
which
is
uncontradicted
that
for
beverages,
carbonated
beverages
and
beer.
the
only
containers
which
can
be
used
are
glass
and
metal.
those
two
items
standing
alone,
soft
drinks
and
beer
on
the
one
hand
and
all
cans
for
food
canning
on
the
other,
total
over
33
billion
items
out
of
a
combined
total
production
of
60
billion
cans
and
glass
containers.
so
without
going
any
further
and
discuss
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
hazel-atlas'
production
was
small.
what
i've
been
trying
to
show
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
in
beer
it
was,
though
it
could
have
--
it
had
the
capacity
next
year
or
the
year
after
to
expand
that
if
it
chose.
we
don't
know.
i've
been
attending
to
show
from
the
inter-industry's
standpoint
that
is
to
the
entire
range
of
commodities
involved,
there
is
the
opportunity
and
ability
on
the
part
of
each
major
company
to
compete
with
the
others
in
the
--
in
the
other
line.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
my
recollection
is
(inaudible)
that
the
can
had
something
like
40%
at
the
time
this
record
was
closed.
i
would
have
to
check
that
to
be
sure
of
my
figure.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
went
in,
in
more
time.
the
figures
and
i
won't
stop
to
try
to
examine
them,
are
set
out
on
beer
at
2970
of
the
record,
your
honor.
now,
we're
told
also
by
mr.
johnson
that
the
price
is
no
factor
so
far
as
the
glass
makers
and
the
can
makers
are
concerned
and
he
relies
on
the
fact
that
on
the
stand,
glass
manufacturers
when
asked
on
cross-examination
whether
they
competed,
said
that
they
stoutly
competed.
i've
earlier
mentioned
numerous
exhibits
--
just
take
one
moment
to
finish
this
please
your
honor
if
i
may.
i've
earlier
mentioned
numerous
exhibits
which
show
that
continental
can
itself
regarded
price
as
a
factor
and
i
would
like
in
closing
to
refer
to
one
more
such
exhibit
which
appears
at
record
2544
in
the
third
volume.
this
is
an
internal
memorandum
of
continental
can
said
--
said,
"serious
consideration
should
be
given
to
sales
department
recommendations
for
reducing
the
quoted
price
on
number
5
round
single
friction
cans
from
the
present
price
of
$67.38
per
thousand
to
a
price
in
the
neighborhood
of
$60
in
order
to
reduce
a
potentially
dangerous
spread
in
favor
of
glass
jars."
thank
you.
