mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
does
not,
i
believe,
present
any
questions
of
law
whatsoever.
it's
a
pure,
simple
fact
case.
the
government
--
the
district
court
decided
the
case
and
the
appellee
are
all
in
agreement
as
to
the
law.
the
district
court,
in
his
oral
statement
indicating
his
decision
to
dismiss
the
case,
had
this
to
say,
record
1537,
"the
basic
defect
in
the
government's
case
does
not
lie
in
its
theories
within
the
nature
and
quality
of
its
proof."
many
of
the
propositions
of
fact
on
which
the
government
relies,
finds
support
only
in
argument.
others
rest
on
most
insubstantial
and
evanescent
evidentiary
foundations.
statements
of
counsel
as
to
what
the
facts
may
be
or
inferences
based
on
incomplete,
yet
not
misleading
statistics
or
mere
glittering
generalities
cannot
be
substituted
for
evidence,
cannot
be
substituted
for
proof,
and
they
cannot
furnish
a
basis
for
finding
of
facts
necessary
to
sustain
the
government's
case.
the
government
insists
that
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
interindustry
mergers
come
under
section
7.
however,
both
the
district
court
and
the
appellee
agreed
that
they
do
if
the
statutory
tests
are
met.
the
government,
however,
is
asking
this
court
to
make
new
findings
with
respect
to
lines
of
commerce
and
with
respect
to
the
effects
of
the
acquisition.
prior
to
the
acquisition
here
in
question,
continental
can
did
not
make
glass
containers
or
any
other
product
that
hazel-atlas
glass
company
made.
hazel-atlas
on
the
other
hand
did
not
make
anything
that
continental
made.
neither
one
was
a
supplier
of
the
other.
they
served
entirely
different
markets.
the
record
shows
no
instance
of
their
meeting
in
the
marketplace.
they
were
not
in
competition
with
each
other.
section
7
cases
break
quite
naturally
into
two
parts,
delineation
of
a
market
and
the
examination
of
the
effects
of
the
merger
in
question.
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
this
court
has
many
times
given
careful
attention
to
the
matter
of
delineating
the
market,
some
of
these
cases,
times-picayune,
cellophane,
du
pont,
general
motors,
international
boxing,
brown
shoe,
philadelphia
bank,
more
recently,
el
paso,
and
lexington
bank.
the
market
test
in
these
cases
has
been
expressed
in
several
ways,
but
they're
all
essentially
the
same.
what
is
the
real
market?
how
do
products
move
in
commerce?
who
really
competes
with
whom?
what
are
the
realities
of
the
marketplace?
du
pont,
general
motors
expressed
the
market
test
in
terms
of
peculiar
--
of
peculiar
characteristics
and
uses.
brown
shoe
expressed
that
in
terms
of
reasonable
interchangeability
of
use
for
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
all
of
these
cases
have
recognized
that
the
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere.
in
a
general
way,
all
products
and
all
services
compete.
there
are
substitutes
for
all
products,
but
the
problem
is
to
find
out
what
is
the
real
market.
with
respect
to
this
second
question
in
section
7
cases,
the
effect
in
competition,
it's
clear
that
the
test
is
the
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effects,
not
mere
possibility,
not
speculation.
in
the
court
below,
the
government
proposed
10
lines
of
commerce.
they
were
carefully
defined
to
result
of
interrogatories,
pretrial
hearings.
some
of
these
lines
were
interindustry
lines,
some
were
industry
lines,
many
of
them
were
fragmentation
lines.
the
government
called
its
witnesses
to
produce
its
evidence
with
respect
to
each
of
the
proposed
lines.
it
called
can
manufacturers.
it
called
representatives
of
principle
glass
container
manufacturers.
except
for
some
testimony
relating
to
beer
containers,
the
can
people
in
general
said
they
knew
nothing
about
glass
and
the
glass
people
said
they
knew
nothing
about
cans.
the
government
called
its
experts,
but
they
failed
to
support
the
proposition
that
cans
and
glass
are
in
the
same
market.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
such
that
it
is
possible
to
use
the
indicia
of
markets
referred
to
in
brown
shoe
and
to
go
right
down
the
line
as
to
what
they
are.
the
district
court
did
that.
the
brown
shoe
case,
having
been
decided
after
the
judge
below
announced
his
oral
decision
to
dismiss
the
complaint
but
before
he
filed
his
formal
findings.
indicia
referred
to
industry
and
public
recognition.
the
can
industry
and
the
glass
container
industry
are
separate
and
well-defined
rather
its
peculiar
characteristics
and
uses.
cans
and
glass
containers
were
made
of
different
materials,
have
different
physical
characteristics.
unique
production
facilities,
can
and
glass
container
manufacturing
equipment
is
not
interchangeable.
the
use
or
point
of
view
is
not
possible
to
use
a
canning
line
designed
to
use
one
type
of
container
to
pack
a
product
in
the
other.
distinct
customers,
there
are
different
customers
for
the
different
types
of
containers.distinct
prices,
glass
containers,
cans
are
priced
separately.
the
price
of
cans
is
determined
primarily
by
the
cost
of
tin
plate.
the
price
of
glass
containers
are
determined
primarily
by
the
cost
of
labor.
sensitivity
to
price
changes,
prices
one
type
of
containers
except
in
the
separate
instance
of
beer
perhaps
that
i
will
come
to,
are
not
changed
in
response
of
price
movements
of
the
other
type.
specialized
vendors,
can
company
sell
their
own
cans,
glass
company
sell
their
glass,
no
jobbers
handle
both,
no
distributors
handle
both.
the
district
court
made
a
most
careful
examination
of
the
evidence
produced
by
the
government
and
found
three
lines
of
commerce.
the
can
industry,
the
glass
industry,
and
containers
for
beer.
these
findings
were
made
by
applying
the
tests
described
by
this
court.
the
district
court
made
a
most
careful
examination
into
the
question
of
how
products
actually
move
in
the
marketplace.
the
government
has
said
both
in
its
brief
and
here
today,
the
district
court
failed
to
consider
interindustry
competition.
they
say
that
his
decision
was
based
on
the
--
largely
on
the
separate
characteristics
of
the
different
containers
is
not
so
at
all.
what
the
district
court
did
is
exemplified
in
this
treatment
of
containers
for
beer.
there
are,
of
course,
beer
cans,
there
are
beer
bottles.
the
district
court
examined
the
evidence
relating
for
the
two
types
of
containers,
found
that
they
were
in
the
same
line
of
commerce
because
he
said
there
were
prima
facie
evidence
of
interchangeability
and
use
in
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
on
this
appeal,
the
government
argues
for
two
lines
of
commerce.
the
first
of
these
is,
all
cans
and
all
glass
containers.
here,
the
government
says
that
since
they
can
both
be
used
to
hold
things,
they're
in
the
same
line
of
commerce.
the
government
calls
this
functional
interchangeability.
and
they
would
disregard
everything
having
to
do
with
actual
usage
including
the
evidence
of
their
own
expert
witnesses.
the
record
doesn't
support
functional
interchangeability.
many
products
can
be
sold
only
in
one
container
or
the
other.
many
of
them
require
different
formulations
for
processing,
depending
on
the
container
that's
used.
liquor,
example
is
always
sold
in
glass
containers.
fresh
milk
cannot
be
sold
in
metal
cans.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
i'd
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record
on
that
but
it's
just
not
possible
to
seal
it.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
--
i
thought
you
were
thinking
of
canned
milk,
no.
fresh
milk
conceivably,
could
be
sold
in
metal
cans
except
for
the
price
i
think.
bottles,
there
have
and
--
and
one
other
thing
that
i
will
come
to,
a
question
of
tradition.
they're
just
not
sold
in
--
in
metal.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
i
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
record
doesn't
support
functional
interchangeability.
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
it's
not
possible,
i'd
say,
to
determine
usage
or
demand
by
physical
interchangeability.
the
solicitor
general
here
the
other
day
in
arguing
alcoa
said,
he
said
quite
properly,
that
what
is
technically
possible
is
not
necessarily
commercially
possible.
the
market
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
over
long
periods
of
time,
it
--
it
has
to
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
--some
extent.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
over
periods
of
time,
it
has.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
it's
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
it's
a
--
it's
a
process
--
it's
a
--
an
aspect
of
competition,
yes.
some
examples.
can
of
coffee,
ground
coffee
was
packaged
in
cans
before
the
war.
the
war
came
along,
metal
was
very
hard
to
get
and
was
severely
rationed.
glass
was
easier
to
get.
so
coffee
for
a
while,
during
the
war,
was
packaged
in
glass.
when
the
war
was
over,
the
coffee
reverted
to
its
traditional
package,
the
can.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
no,
sir,
there's
not.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes
to
a
--
to
very
minor
extent.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well,
not
that
there
isn't
competition,
but
there
isn't
very
much
but
it's
of
a
different
kind
and
quality.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well,
it
is
not
a
direct
competition.
it's
a
long
range,
slow
moving,
depending
on
--
on
other
market
factors
but
just
customer
preference
for
example.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
competition
that
is
within
the
--
the
term
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
both.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
that's
right,
but
the
--
the
preliminary
question
in
any
section
7
action
is
to
determine
the
line
of
commerce
which
the
effect
in
competition
is
to
be
measured.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
sir,
there
is.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
in
any
line
of
commerce.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
substantially,
lessen
competition.
yes,
sir.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
both.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
there
are
all
kinds
of
variations
on
that
metal
and
plastic,
metal
and
paper,
tin
--
tin
and
aluminum
in
the
same
container.
unquestionably,
there
are
all
kinds
of
variations
of
containers
of
that
type.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
the
market
still
has,
always
had
variations
--
various
factors
which
will
determine
usage.
the
various
with
the
type
of
--
of
container,
of
some
of
them
are
weight
for
example.
tradition
is
very
important
in
determining
what
type
of
container
is
used.
consumer
preference,
i
appeal
breakability,
the
shape
of
the
container,
the
size
of
--
the
difference
between
retail
sizes
and
institutional
sizes.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well,
conceivably,
it
could.
the
beer
business,
however,
is
and
about
the
selling
of
containers
for
beer
is
a
thing
apart.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
counterpart.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
that
is
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
that
is
so.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well,
the
--
the
public
bought
it,
beer
in
cans.
you
may
recall,
came
into
popularity
as
a
result
of
the
same
thing
i
was
referring
to
before
the
war
conditions
under
which
here
is
a
question
await.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
beer
and
cans
was
--
was
packaged
for
the
overseas
troupes.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
no
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
there
is.
here,
we
had
continental
can
in
the
can
industry,
hazel-atlas
in
the
glass.
by
acquiring
hazel-atlas,
continental
simply
went
into
the
glass
container
business
and
had
to,
thus
compete
there
just
hazel-atlas.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
i
think
that's
--
that's
probably
so,
yes.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
well,
perhaps
not.
and
i
do
think
that
they
have
come
to
the
--
again
to
the
questions
of
just
what
is
the
--
the
effect
of
the
--
the
beer
can
market
and
a
mere
--
mere
container
market.
the
court
here
found
that
while
he
found
the
line
of
commerce
consisting
of
beer
containers,
hazel-atlas
was
not
that
market
in
any
substantial
form.
it
had
no
intention
of
the
--
and
that
the
effect
and
competition
in
that
line
of
commerce
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
--
was
nothing.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
pardon?
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
without
a
great
deal
of
course,
they
do
contend
otherwise.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
i
think
they
have
relegated
the
subject
to
our
footnote
in
their
brief,
however.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
everyday
experience
indicates
the
truth
of
the
fact
that
containers
--
the
products
tend
to
move
--
and
do
move
in
one
type
of
container
or
the
other.
you
don't
have
mayonnaise,
for
example,
in
glass
--
in
metal
cans
in
your
pantry.
you
don't
have
tuna
fish
in
glass
jars.
jams
and
jellies
are
in
glass.
it
wouldn't
ever
occur
here
to
you
to
order
a
can
of
vinegar
or
a
can
of
ketchup
or
glass
jar
of
sardines.
for
one
reason
or
another,
they
are
packaged
as
they
are
packaged
in
a
given
type
of
container
and
not
in
the
other.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
sir,
you
have.
i
think
it's
important
and
if
i
may,
i
will
come
to
the
question
of
what
the
government
has
done
with
other
substitute
containers
in
this
case
and
on
this
appeal.
the
government
refers
to
the
exhibits
of
the
fbi,
dissent
of
the
fbi
out
to
purchase
apparently,
at
random
under
unknown
instructions,
types
of
--
of
products
bought
in
that
were
packaged,
they
said,
in
both
types
of
containers.
and
the
fbi
went
out
and
brought
in
their
findings.
what
did
they
bring
in?
they
brought
in
products
that
were
obviously
different
products
or
packages
for
different
markets.
they
bought
in
ketchup
and
they
bought
in
--
brought
in
ketchup
in
a
bottle.
they
brought
in
ketchup
and
they
brought
it
in
--
in
a
can,
but
what
was
the
can?
there's
an
institutional
size
of
a
can.
you
can
tell
from
across
--
across
a
court
room
what
the
difference
in
the
product
were.
they
brought
in
olives.
olives,
ripe
ones
of
course,
were
in
cans,
green
ones
in
glass.
they
brought
in
fruit
preserves.
some
of
the
fruit
preserves
were
in
glass.
they
brought
in
fruit
preserves
in
cans.
the
cans,
of
course,
were
the
premium
imported
fruit
preserves.
they
don't
pack
them
in
cans
in
united
states.
so
far
from
proving
that
these
things
were
competitive,
the
government
stipulated
that
the
products
were
not
the
same
that
the
agents
who
picked
them
up
didn't
know
anything
about
prices.
they
didn't
know
whether
they
were
dietetic
products,
special
products.
they
didn't
know
how
they
were
processed.
they
knew
nothing
about
it.
the
very
idiom
of
the
english
language
describes
--
reflects
how
products
are
packaged.you
get
down
the
list
of
them.
a
bottle
of
whisky,
a
can
of
paint,
a
jar
of
cold
cream,
can
of
sardines,
bottle
of
ketchup,
bottle
of
medicine.
you
can
try
them
in
reverse
and
see
how
they
sound.
you
won't
recognize
them.
a
can
of
whiskey,
a
bottle
of
paint,
can
of
cold
cream,
bottle
of
sardines,
can
of
medicine.
the
government
here
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
a
can
of
aspirin?
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
a
can
of
aspirin.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
you
will
grow
on
your
own
experience,
mr.
chief
justice.
you
will
know
that
the
aspirin
in
cans,
the
little
pocket
sized,
in
bottles
to
medicine,
cabinet
bottle.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
there
maybe
some
small
ones,
sir.
generally
speaking,
what
i
say
is
correct.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
(inaudible)
i'll
do
that.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
right
now.
i
don't
--
well,
i
think
perhaps
i'd
better
wait
until
i'll
get
to
that
thing.
the
government
here
points
to
various
studies,
the
possible
markets
for
glass
and
metal
containers.
they
were
referred
to
these
as
evidence
of
competition
between
the
two.
most
of
the
studies
which
they
refer
to
--
relate
to
beer.
and
unquestionably,
as
a
market
consisting
of
beer
cans
and
one
consisting
of
beer
bottles,
the
district
court
found
that
they
comprised
one
market.
well,
we
disputed
that
below.
we
don't'
challenge
that
here.
some
of
the
studies
relate
to
soft
drinks.
the
record
shows
that
hazel-atlas
is
concerned
with
soft
drink
bottles
was
negligible.
it
made
no
returnable
bottles
and
by
brief
cans,
1%
of
the
total
domestic
shipments
are
none
returnable
bottles.
most
of
the
studies
referred
to
are
long
range
ivory
tower
projects.
their
studies
which
ask
a
question,
if
we
could
design
a
can
for
a
product
which
now
moved
in
glass
or
paper
or
some
other
package
in
which
the
public
will
buy.
what
might
our
market
be?
included
here,
are
studies
which
relate
to
such
exotic
subjects
as
a
possibility
of
putting
wine
in
cans
or
of
putting
ketchup
in
aerosol
cans.
these
are
type
of
developmental
research
that
any
company
must
engage
in
but
i
submit
that
it
reveals
nothing
about
competition
or
about
interchangeability
of
usage
or
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
the
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
the
saver
lock
can
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
the
saver
lock
can
which
is
so
glowingly
described
there,
designed
to
handle
practically
everything
in
the
world
was
another
failure,
couldn't
be
sold
and
you'd
never
seen
it
on
the
market.
i
think
they
couldn't
move
into
these
markets.
these
factors
of
--
market
factors
and
actual
usage
militated
so
against
that
that
the
can
was
never
marketed.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
that
is
so.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
that
is
what
has
been
the
history
of
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
--
such
changes.
it's
what
the
long
range
switches
as
there
had
been.
when
the
solicitor
general,
last
thursday,
argued
here
the
question
of
conflict
in
the
alcoa
case,
competition
between
copper
and
aluminum,
he
was
describing
a
product
which
22%
of
the
market
was
actually
in
copper.
he
said
then,
i
think
i
quoted
exactly.
"this
is
not
competition
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
word."
and
it's
that
that
point
that
he
went
on
to
say
of
what
is
technically
possible.it's
not
always
commercially
possible.
the
district
court,
i
believe,
was
clearly
correct
when
it
found
no
reasonable
interchangeability
of
use
between
glass
containers
and
metal
containers.
similarly,
there
is
no
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
as
i've
said,
can
prices
relate
to
price
of
tin
plate,
glass
prices
relate
to
the
cost
of
labor.
mr.
spritzer,
this
morning
said
that
the
price
differentials
between
the
two
types
of
containers
is
relatively
small.
how
does
he
know?
the
record
here
certainly
does
not
show
it.
price
sensitivity
is
perhaps
the
most
important
indicator
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand,
but
the
prices
or
one
type
of
container
are
not
sensitive
to
price
changes
of
the
other.
manufacturers
of
one
type
of
container,
for
example,
don't
equalize
freight
with
the
other.
manufacturers
of
one
type
don't
meet
competition
in
the
robinson-patman
act
sense
of
the
other.
the
pricing
practices
are
different.
cans
are
sold
therefore
be,
glass
containers
on
a
delivered
basis.
the
government
calls
attention
to
one
exhibit,
exhibit
gx773
at
page
2821
of
the
record.
in
their
brief,
they
say
in
at
least
one
instance,
a
food
packer
has
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
reduced
price
for
glass
containers,
that
is
by
threat
to
use
tin.
in
all
of
this
billion
dollar
glass
container
industry,
billion
and
a
half
dollar
can
industry.
over
the
period
of
years
of
this
case,
which
in
trial
with
dozens
of
witnesses,
with
the
fbi
up
and
down
the
country.
the
government
brings
out
one
and
it's
the
only
one.
one
instance
of
food
packer,
they
say,
has
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
reduced
price
for
glass
containers.
the
report
which
they
relies,
a
report
of
a
salesman,
he
said
he
had
heard
that
a
competing
glass
container
manufacturer
had
not
put
its
full
price
increase
into
effect.
packers
reported,
they
have
said
that
the
price
increase
would
cut
down
on
the
use
of
--
of
glass
because
it
would
be
two
parts
of
line,
with
the
cost
of
the
packer's
tin
package.
the
author
of
the
report
said
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
not
--
whether
or
not
it
was
true.
this
is
the
government's
evidence,
cross-elasticity
of
demand,
price
sensitivity.
i
submit
that
a
local
justice
of
the
peace
would
demand
better
evidence
in
a
dog
bite
(ph)
case.
the
government
picks
out
from
all
types
of
packaging,
cans
and
glass.
but
at
best,
the
type
of
competition
that
exists
between
these
types
of
containers
is
the
same
as
that
which
exist
between
all
kinds
of
packaging
material,
and
the
district
court
found
nothing
but
i
wish
to
define
such
a
market.
this
is
in
the
courts
--
this
is
in
the
court
below
as
the
government's
packaging
line.
the
government
here
in
its
brief
recognizes
that
the
competitive
relationship
between
cans
and
glass
containers
is
the
same
as
between
paper
packages,
plastic
bags
and
all
other
types
of
packages
which
goods
are
packed.
the
government
proposes
here
to
ignore
all
of
the
other
types
of
packages.
why
they
want
to
do
that
isn't
really
clear.
mr.
spritzer
says
that
for
most
of
the
uses
for
which
cans
and
glass
are
used,
they
alone
are
usable.
i
don't
know
how
mr.
spritzer
knows
that.
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
but
this
maneuver,
the
government
tries
to
exclude
all
the
other
types
of
packaging
which
they
found
embarrassing
to
think
of
some
of
those,
milk
cartons,
in
direct
competition
with
milk
bottles,
paper
cartons
for
frozen
foods,
terrific
market,
in
direct
competition
with
cans.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
it
varies.
certainly,
that
between
milk
bottles
and
milk
cartons,
is
a
direct
competition.
this
is,
i
would
believe
--
although
we
don't
have
the
evidence
here
in
this
record,
i
would
believe
that
that
would
be
a
line
of
commerce,
by
applying
that
the
--
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
milk
cartoons
and
milk
bottles.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
some
of
them
are
--
are
more
remote,
like
simple
packaging
for
example,
requires
a
--
a
different
type
of
--
often
times
the
processing
is
different
or
the
formulation
is
different.
you
might
put,
for
example,
fresh
fruits
in
a
plastic
bag.
well,
it
would
be
canned
and
put
it
in
a
can.
but
it's
the
same
type
of
competition
exactly
that
exists
between
cans
and
glass
generally.
and
the
government
recognizes
that.
they
say
so
in
footnote
18
to
their
brief.
by
this
maneuver,
they've
excluded
all
of
the
other
types
of
packaging.
the
whole
range
of
packaging
includes
plastic
bottles,
jars,
paper
folding
cartoons,
plastic
folding
cartoons,
plastic
films,
other
flexible
packaging,
cargo
in
shipping
containers,
textile
bags,
aluminum
tumblers,
metal
tubes,
foil
tabs,
bags,
drums,
crocks,
wooden
barrels.
this
was
their
packaging
line
below.
they
have
produced
no
evidence,
no
substantial
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
any
cross-elasticity
of
demand
reasonable
interchange
of
usage
in
this
field.
and
the
--
the
district
court
said
there
was
no
evidence
by
which
he
could
find
that
this
was
a
line
of
commerce.
the
reason
why
the
government
has
tried
to
gerrymander
the
market
in
this
way,
perhaps,
there's
something
to
do
with
their
attempts
to
build
up
percentages.
they
--
this
whole
field
of
packaging
would
probably
amount
to
15
billions
or
more
dollars
a
year.
now,
$15
billion,
hazel-atlas
had
less
than
one-half
or
1%
of
it.
even
at
$10
billion,
hazel-atlas
had
less
than
three-quarters
or
1%.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
they
have.
yes,
sir.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
it's
my
understanding
that
they
developed
it
in
connection
with
a
glass
company
and
that
they
subsequently
purchased
the
interest
of
the
glass
company
in
that
market.
so
now
i
believe
it's
--
it's
wholly
on
it.
i
don't
know
how
many
plants
they
had.
going
on,
some
of
these
glass
container
witnesses,
as
mr.
(inaudible),
pierce
glass,
who
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
president
of
the
glass
container
manufactures
institute
to
which
mr.
spritzer
referred."
now,
in
selling
your
glass
containers,
do
you
ever
lower
your
price
to
meet
the
price
of
cans?"
"no,"
he
says,
"i
have
never
come
in
contact
with
can
prices."
mr.
foster,
foster
forbes
at
578
of
the
transcript,
"would
you
say
that
competition
was
keen
and
vigorous
in
the
glass
container
industry?"
"yes
sir."
the
court:
"do
you
find
it
more
keen
and
vigorous
or
less
keen
and
vigorous
since
1956?"
the
witness:
"more."
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
thank
you,
if
the
court
please.
before
the
recess,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
el
paso
and
lexington
bank
except
that
these
cases
reemphasized
a
necessity
of
market
determination
and
measuring
the
effects
of
the
merger
in
those
markets.
i
don't
think
they
have
any
clear
relation
to
the
case
before
the
court
here.
el
paso
dealt
with
a
market
which
where
the
market
was
clear,
natural
gas.
now,
there
was
a
direct
elimination
of
a
competitor
or
of
a
potential
competitor
in
a
well-defined
market.
lexington
bank,
also
the
--
at
least
one
of
the
lines
of
commerce
there,
the
commercial
banking
was
obvious.
the
market
was
defined
quite
closely
and
there
was
an
elimination
of
direct
competition
and
of
course
the
percentages
there
were
high.
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
district
court
would
have
decided
this
case
any
differently
than
he
did
in
the
light
of
those
cases.
mr.
helmer
r.
johnson
yes,
sir.
the
record
here,
as
i
was
saying
is,
there's
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
any
anticompetitive
effect
whatsoever,
notwithstanding
as
the
district
court
considered
everything
he
could
think
off
and
all
the
arguments
that
were
raised
that
indicated
any
likelihood,
reasonable
likelihood
of
anticompetitive
effects.
he
went
down
the
line,
prior
acquisitions,
the
intention
of
the
parties,
likelihood
of
suppression
of
products
lines,
elimination
of
competition,
weakening
of
the
companies
in
their
respective
lines,
advantages
resulting
from
the
acquisition,
concentration,
change
in
market
position,
effects
on
competitors,
ease
of
entry,
tendency
of
the
word
monopoly.
he
found
nothing.
he
indicated
any
reasonably
probable
anticompetitive
effect,
and
the
government
here
points
to
nothing
that
would
indicate
a
reasonable
probability
of
anticompetitive
effects.
they
argue
that
this
should
be
assumed.
but
why
should
they
be
assumed?
reasonable
probability
is
subject
to
proof
perhaps
not
as
precisely
as
past
events
but
enough
to
guide
our
lives.
we
know
quite
a
bit
about
the
cause
and
effect
and
in
trying
to
evaluate
the
probability
of
anticompetitive
effects
without
any
facts
to
go
off,
i
guess
it's
completely
useless.
the
government
in
its
brief
and
its
arguments
has
mentioned
concentration
and
dominance.
they
don't
say
what
they
mean
by
this
or
how
they
should
be
used
in
the
application
of
section
7.
surely,
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
7,
from
the
rulings
of
this
court,
they
cannot
be
serious
about
an
automatic
application
of
the
statute
simply
to
something
that
is
big.
when
i
say
just
their
word
about
statistics,
the
government
here
admittedly
has
had
difficulty
with
its
statistics
but
they
keep
on
using.
they
apologize
for
them
--
in
their
brief.
they
still
keep
on
using
them.
they'd
tried
here
to
add
statistics
that
couldn't
be
added.
metal
working
industry,
the
can
industry,
reports
to
the
bureau
of
census
in
terms
of
based
boxes
of
steel
used,
they
don't
report
in
terms
of
the
number
of
containers
made.
the
glass
container
industry
reports
to
the
bureau
of
census
in
units.
no
one
has
ever
seen
fit
to
combine
the
statistics,
so
far
apart
of
the
industries.
the
government
here
tried
to
do
it.
the
government
clerk
knowing
nothing
about
the
industries
whatsoever,
made
certain
assumptions.
he
assumed
that
all
cans
were
the
same
size.
he
assumed
that
all
cans
were
the
same
product
mix.
how
wrong
he
was?
the
record
shows
for
example
that
approximately
14,000
evaporated
milk
cans
can
be
made
up
from
this
ton
of
steel.
approximately
2800
lard
cans
can
be
made
from
a
ton
of
steel.
he
ignored
all
products.
he
tried
to
add
the
two
together
and
came
up
with
some
figures
which
have
no
relation
whatsoever
to
reality.
the
government
mentioned
some
figure
of
continental
having
23%,
hazel-atlas,
3%
of
something.
the
figures
could
be
varied
by
as
much
as
you
like
depending
on
the
hypothesis
used.
the
district
court
considered
this
very
carefully
and
concluded
that
he
states
in
his
opinion
that
the
combinations
were
predicated
on
implausible
hypothesis,
not
supported
by
the
record.
their
figures
are
worthless.
your
honors
here,
we
have
a
case
that
was
carefully
tried
by
the
district
court.
there
was
careful
pretrial,
careful
analysis
of
the
evidence
down
to
minute
details,
or
carefully
prepared
findings
and
opinions.
i
submit,
this
decision
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
