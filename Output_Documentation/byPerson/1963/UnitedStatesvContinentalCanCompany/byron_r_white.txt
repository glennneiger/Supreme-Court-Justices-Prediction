well,
has

mr.

has
a

has
metal
replaced
any
glass
in
the
packaging
business

the
container
business?
justice

and
has
glass
--

--
and
has
glass
replaced
metal?
justice
byron

white
well,
what
is
that
process
of
replacing,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
called
that
competition
or
something
else
or
non
--
justice
byron

white
--
interchangeability
or
interchangeable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
really
there
is
no
denying
to
say
that
--
that
metal
is
replacing
glass
and
glass
replacing
metal.
justice
byron

and
--
and
it's
going
on
currently
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
it
--
your
point
is
that
there's
not
--
there
isn't
competition,
there
has
been
none
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
really
worried
about
section
7,
that's
like
cross-elasticity,
section
7.
what
kind
of
section
7
doesn't
talk
about
cross-elasticity
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it's
about
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
admittedly,
there
is
some
competition
between
the
--
the
tin
and
glass.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
section
7
says
that
--
that
no
mergers
if
it
may
--
may
(voice

competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
--
your
point
is
there's
not
enough
competition
as
there
are
in
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
johnson
--
justice

(inaudible)

otherwise
because

in

(inaudible)

i
gather
that
you
state
that
they
have
a
competition
(inaudible)
that
that
involved
in
section
7.
it
maybe
that
glass
can
be
placed
metal
today
and
from
then
on,
the
glass
can
be
just
placed
metal
and
there's
no
more
competition
for
metal.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
there's
a
change,
why
that
product
would
never
be
packaged
again
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
other
container.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
same
--
is
that
the
same
kind
of
--
is
that
the
same
kind
of
competition
as
between
glass
and
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
those
products
for
which
milk
and
--
for
which
those
two
products
are
in
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
whole
field
of
packaging.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
everything
that
would
be
in
the
same
level
of
competition
exists
between
cans
and
glass.
they've
recognized
the
weakness
in
this
argument,
this
attempt
to
carve
out
artificial
line
of
commerce
and
so
they
have
turned
to
a
subsidiary
line
of
commerce
as
they
called
containers
for
can.
here,
they
would
seize
on
one
physical
characteristics,
just
one,
the
possibility
of
creating
a
hermetic
seal
on
a
container
which
can
be
heat
sterilized
and
they'd
ignored
all
other
characteristics.
here,
they
ask
this
court
to
overturn
the
district
court's
finding
that
there
was
no
line
of
commerce
for
can.
they
had
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
the
court
below
as
to
what
they
meant
by
this
line
of
commerce.
sometimes,
it
would
be
one
thing,
sometimes
the
other.
they
couldn't
decide
whether
products
which
were
hermetically
sealed
should
be
in
it
or
not.
they
couldn't
decide
even
which
products
should
be
in
it.
their
experts
couldn't
agree.
the
district
court
deals
with
this
confusion,
this
opinion.
it
points
out,
footnote
79
of
1639,
"excluded
from
the
government's
definition
of
canned
foods
by
one
or
both
of
the
food
experts
who
testified
for
the
government
for
such
items
as
coffee,
mayonnaise,
vegetable
oil,
shortening,
syrup,
concentrated
fruit
juices,
pasteurized
whole
milk,
pasteurized
barbecue
sauce,
maraschino
cherries,
green
and
spanish
olives,
peanut
butter,
nuts,
condiments,
frozen
foods
and
vegetables.
some
items
such
as
vinegar,
pickles,
fruit
preserves
and
fruit
jellies
were
excluded
by
one
expert
and
included
by
the
other.
this
alleged
line
of
commerce,
then
was
fully
explored
in
the
court
below.
the
government
put
on
an
acknowledged
food
expert,
mr.
hallenbau,
but
he
denied
that
packaging
food
in
cans
was
the
same
as
packaging
food
in
glass.
he
pointed
out
that
their
processing
was
different,
that
the
cooking
time
was
different.
the
packing
lines
were
different,
that
the
economics
were
different.
inclusions
from
this
is
clear.
most
packers
would
not
use
a
container
different
from
the
one
that
they
normally
use
if
they
were
given
the
other
one
free.
they
just
couldn't
afford
to,
price
doesn't
even
apprehend
to
it.
there's
no
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
in
order
to
change
their
--
from
one
type
of
container
to
the
other,
they
would
have
to
set
up
new
packing
lines,
they
would
have
to
change
their
formulations,
they'd
have
to
change
their
method
of
distribution,
they
don't
do
it.
the
government
here
in
its
brief
has
made
heavy
reliance
on
the
facts
outside
of
the
record.
they
cite
several
times
a
couple
of
books
by
economists.
(inaudible)
decided
several
times,
mr.
mckee
has
cited
several
times.
but
even
these
outside
the
record
evidences,
things
that
they
didn't
put
on
in
the
trial
below,
don't
support
their
argument.
i've
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
mckee,
speaking
of
glass
and
can
markets
since
there
is
no
container
market.
their
markets
are
heterogenous.
(inaudible)
says
the
inflexibility
of
consumer
taste
and
customs
plus
the
chemical
and
physical
properties
of
foods
placed
real
limitations
on
the
substitution
of
one
type
of
container
for
another.
although
this
case
was
tried,
about
almost
four
years
after
the
acquisition,
the
government
put
on
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
have
actual
effect
on
competition.
they
put
on
no
evidence
of
probable
effects
of
the
acquisition.
they
had
representatives
of
all
of
the
major
glass
containers
on
the
witness
stand.
they
suggest
that
no
anticompetitive
effects.
one
of
them
suggested
somewhat
diffidently
that
there
might
be
some
advantage
in
selling
glass
containers
and
in
--
and
closures
together.
but
he
quickly
added
that
his
company
could
make
closures
if
it
wanted
too.
there
were
no
patents
that
prevented
them.
his
company
had
plenty
of
money
to
do
it.
they
weren't
interested.
this
doesn't
indicate
any
real
advantage
of
selling
the
two
containers
together.
well,
what
did
the
other
people
say?
they
had
one
glass
container
after
the
other
on
the
stand.
some
of
them
--
i'll
read
the
excerpts
from
the
testimony
of
some.
it's
mr.
levis,
owens-illinois,
"now,
you
testified,
mr.
levis,
on
cross-examination
that
competition
among
the
glass
container
industries
is
keen
and
correct
--
vigorous.
is
that
correct?
you
so
testified."
"yes,
sir."
would
that
be
in
all
of
the
various
lines
of
glass
containers
that
you
manufacture?"
"yes."
"prior
to
1956,
would
you
have
included
hazel-atlas
glass
company
in
that
group?"
answer:
"they
were
competing
vigorously
for
business."
the
court:
"is
the
entity
that
was
formerly
hazel-atlas
glass
still
competing?"
the
witness:
"yes,
sir,
they
are
very
competitive."
mr.
green
fetcher
(ph)

185
of
the
record.
"would
you
say
that
competition
in
the
glass
container
industry
is
keen
and
vigorous?"
answer:
"i
certainly
would."
question:
"you
do
not
quote
prices
to
a
specific
customer
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
can
prices,
do
you?"
"no."
"you
do
not
equalize
freight
with
any
can
plants,
do
you?"
"no,
we
do
not."
"the
location
of
any
can
manufacturing
plant
or
plants,
does
that
have
any
relation
to
the
location
of
your
glass
container
plant?"
answer:
"if
i
understand
you,
you
are
asking
me,
if
we
locate
our
plants
or
have
that
factor
as
a
decision
where
our
plant
is
located,
the
answer
is
no."
