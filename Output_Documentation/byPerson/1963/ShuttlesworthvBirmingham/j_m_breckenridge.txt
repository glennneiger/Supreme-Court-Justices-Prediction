mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
the
first
issue
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
the
granting
of
certiorari
and
the
failure
to
comply
with
judicial
procedure
in
the
state
of
alabama
in
going
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
that
was
complete
--
they
completely
ignored
that
rule.
any
attorney
in
alabama
can
tell
you
that
that's
fatal.
at
any
case,
it's
fatal.
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
on
numerous
--
alabama
supreme
court,
that
they
must
use
this
paper.
now,
it
is
not
merely
a
ritual.
there
are
reasons
behind
it.
i
am
sure
it
has
been
enforced
in
effect
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
reasonable
body.
and
it
has
withstood
the
test
of
time.
the
plaintiff
ignored
it.
the
--
rather
the
appellant
ignored
it.
and
in
view
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
case
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
and
in
view
of
hammerstein.
and
we
must
remember
that
hammerstein,
even
though
this
court
granted
certiorari,
they
still
came
back
and
said
the
court
is
right.
there
was
procedural
method.
they
could
take
hammerstein
with
an
appeal.
in
a
paternity
suit,
they
failed
to
take
the
appeal.
they
could
have
taken
the
appeal.
hammerstein
involved
probation.
so
this
court
came
back
in
hammerstein
and
dismissed
because
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted
but
need
--
that
not
be
in
the
--
that
being
the
case
nonetheless.
i
think
this
case
has
an
element
here
that
is
of
such
paramount
importance
but
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
point
further.
this
court,
of
course,
understands
that
point
far
more
than
i
could
possibly
enlighten
as
to
the
need
for
order
in
the
judicial
procedure
and
they
bring
in
the
case
to
this
court.
now,
the
next
thing
i
would
like
to
go
is
to
go
to
the
merits.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
don't
know
of
any
case
it
had
been
waived.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
unless
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
don't
think
there
was
a
waiver
of
that
particular
rule.
there
was
some
other.
i
would
say
that
for
--
if
there
--
i
believe
he
mentioned
something
about
when
somebody
was
in
prison
and
filed
something,
but
i
believe
that,
now,
they
have
--
there
have
been
cases
where
they
have
said
that
your
failure
to
comply
with
this
rule
is
failing
intimate
and
then
went
on
to
render
a
decision,
discussed
the
merits
and
render
a
decision.
i
admit
there
are
a
few
cases,
very
few
on
that
but
i
have
a
feeling
sometime
that
that's
the
--
that's
the
humanity
of
the
court
in
recognizing
that
they
don't
want
to
put
the
lawyer
on
the
spot.
it's
hard
to
go
back
to
his
client
and
say,
"i
goofed."
they
can
go
back
now
and
say,
"well,
although
i
didn't
file
it
on
paper,
it
wouldn't
do
him
any
good
anyway",
is
what
they
said.
now,
there
are
one
or
two
cases
on
that.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that
is
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
i
mean,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
i
would
say
that
the
question
in
this
case
involved
a
serious
issue
and
they
disposed
of
it
as
expeditely
as
possible.
and
it
is
the
issue
that
i
want
to
come
to
now.
mr.
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
don't
believe
it
is
--
it
is
correct.
it
may
be,
it
may
not.
i
have
never
risked
doing
that
and
i
don't
know
of
any
lawyer,
personally,
that
had
risked
doing
it.
it's
certainly
not
in
the
rules.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
no.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
it
--
it
--
if
that
may
or
may
not
be.
i
--
i
cannot
answer
for
the
court
on
each
and
every
case.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
that
would
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
as
the
court
has
said,
the
--
this
is
bound
and
bound
volumes
and
when
paper
is
stapled
on
it
maybe
of
a
greater
texture
that
will
not
withstand
and
will
not
stand
the
test
of
time
and
will
not
make
a
permanent
record.
i
don't
think
its
good
practice
but
i
would
--
to
staple
it
on
if
it
is
done
and
i
don't
know
that
it
is
done.
i
have
--
have
never
seen
it
personally
done
and
i
don't
know
of
any
particular
case
in
which
it
has
been
done.
certainly,
the
rules
do
not
authorize
it
and
it
is
not
written
on
paper
if
it's
stapled
on.
now,
it
--
as
i
said,
let
me
get
to
the
merits.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
copy
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
that
is
sent
out
to
the
attorney
is
on
ordinary
paper.
now,
whether
or
not
the
--
yes,
i
believe
and
i
--
i'd
hate
to
say
this
without
knowing
him,
but
my
guess
is
that
the
--
that
it
is
--
well,
i
don't
--
it's
transcribed
to
the
--
well,
i
don't
know
that.
i
won't
say
that.
but
the
--
that
is
correct.
the
opinion
is
sent
out
to
the
attorneys
and
the
opinion
which
we
received
is
on
ordinary
legal
paper.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes,
sir.
when
i
take
certiorari
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court.
when
i
take
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
i
type
--
have
typed
on
transcript
paper,
word
for
word,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
since
it
is
the
opinion
that
is
before
them.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
would
--
i
would
not
say
at
this
time.
the
clerk
--
clerk,
of
course,
may
set
a
record
up
in
connection
with
filing
in
this
court
and
would
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
this
court
and
such
rules
of
alabama
supreme
court
that
relate
to
filing
in
this
court
and
not
by
petition
for
certiorari.
that
will
show
on
--
on
that
--
that's
the
opinion
that
is
stapled
on
that.
yes,
i
--
that
would
not
involve
rule
32,
certainly.
if
there's
a
rule
involved
here,
it
would
be
what
he
sent
to
this
court
and
not
--
but
the
only
--
as
this
court
knows,
the
petition
was
stricken,
as
--
as
hundreds
of
other
cases
have
been.
and
i
wouldn't
--
as
i
said
before,
i
think
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case
is
the
fact.
now,
mr.
greenberg,
in
discussing
the
facts,
left
out
the
most
important
one
and
that
is
that
this
occurrence
occurred
on
may
--
on
a
may
--
on
a
wednesday,
which
was
three
days
subsequent
to
mother's
day
in
may
1961.
there
had
been
an
attack
on
so-called
"freedom
riders"
on
that
sunday.
there
had
--
this
particular
group
of
freedom
riders
came
in
from
nashville,
some
18
or
20
was
in
the
group.
i
believe
12
was
--
testified
to
be
from
nashville.
of
course,
there's
--
and
they
came
into
the
bus
station.
there
was
publicity.
there
was
200
to
300
people
outside
of
the
bus
station.
there
was
knowledge
of
the
police
that
they
were
menacing.
the
police
had
cleared
the
white
people
out
of
the
bus
station.
they
had
made
arrests
and
they
had
pushed
them
back
off
the
streets.
they
had,
for
over
two
hours,
block
traffic
and
reverend
shuttlesworth,
in
his
own
testimony,
stated
that
as
people
got
off
from
work
and
publicity
was
made,
people
began
to
gather
there.
there
was
no
constitutional
right
being
denied
to
anybody.
the
city
of
birmingham
was
not
prohibiting
the
riders
from
boarding
a
bus
and
leaving
but
the
buses
was
not
run.
the
--
the
record
shows
that
the
bus
drivers
were
not
driving.
they
just
wouldn't
take
them
out.
the
reason
for
that
on
the
preceding
sunday,
a
bus
had
been
burned
on
the
highway
at
anniston.
and
to
further
show
the
reasonableness
of
the
police
officers,
in
montgomery,
alabama,
there
was
a
major
attack
on
the
peace
officer,
and
those
policemen
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
maintaining
law
and
order
and
that
is
the
fundamental
duty
that
they
were
performing.
that
--
that
duty
wasn't
making
an
arrest.
of
course,
the
--
as
its
brief
cites
the
city
code
section
which
says
that
the
duty
is
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
to
protect
persons.
now,
they
did
not
arrest
the
freedom
riders,
so-called.
we
do
not
say
that
they
violated
a
law.
we
do
not
say
that
they
violated
an
ordinance
but
we
do
say
that
there
was
a
riot
in
the
making.
and
we
do
know
that
a
riot
had
occurred
on
a
bus
on
a
highway.
we
do
know
that
a
riot
had
occurred
at
another
bus
station
a
block
away,
well,
not
a
riot
but
an
attack
and
because
there
has
been
no
riot
in
birmingham,
alabama
contrary
to
the
impression
a
lot
of
people
have.
there
had
been
no
fighting
between
the
white
people
and
the
black
--
and
the
colored
people.
there
have
been
fighting
between
colored
people
and
police,
yes,
in
certain
instances.
there
have
been
fighting
against
by
extremist
groups
against
police
and
arrests
have
been
made
on
--
on
both
sides.
but
as
i
was
--
i
was
saying,
the
--
the
riot
in
montgomery,
alabama
shows
a
situation
there.
that's
a
fight
regardless
of
any
constitutional
rights,
we
--
police
knew
that
they
had
a
situation
there
which
--
wherein
people
needed
protection.
and
these
--
and,
incidentally,
montgomery,
alabama,
i
will
tell
the
court
that
the
city
of
birmingham
was
made
a
party
by
the
department
of
justice
and
they
attempted
to
enjoin
us
from
failing
to
--
from
failing
to
protect
interstate
travelers.
our
evidence
showed
that
we
did
protect
them.
it
showed
that
we
did
not
--
that
we
were
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
protect
them.
the
injunction
was
not
granted
against
the
city
of
birmingham.
it
was
granted
against
the
city
of
montgomery.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
as
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
there
is
no
specific
provision
of
alabama
law
that
discusses
protected
custody.
there
is
no
decision
of
alabama
courts
that
refers
to
protective
custody.
so
we
are
guided
only
by
this
decision
that
protective
custody
is
where
a
person
is
willing
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
and
that
--
in
this
case,
we
submit,
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
freedom
riders
did
not
object
to
being
taken
into
protective
custody
and
i
don't
blame
them.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
did
not
object.
they
did
not
bring
any
--
they
object.
they
did
not
bring
any
action.
they
did
not
make
any
determination.
in
other
words,
they
submitted
to
protective
custody.
and
now,
that
protective
custody
--
no
charge
was
made
against
them.
they
were
merely
transported
from
the
place
where
a
riot
was
in
the
making
and
carried
to
a
safe
place.
now,
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
there.
he
did
not
come
in
with
these
young
negroes
from
nashville,
and
they
were
young
mixed
college
student
and
they
were
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
police.
and
the
only
reasonable
way
the
police
could
have
protected
those
children
or
those
young
people
was
doing
what
they
did.
they
were
not
mistreated.
they
were
carried
to
the
--
the
record
shows
no
objection
even
by
one
of
them
that
testified,
except
that
she
was
held
at
the
city
jail
and
released.
and
they
did
exercise
their
constitutional
rights
when
the
fire
was
out.
when
the
danger
was
gone,
they
got
on
the
buses
and
went
to
montgomery.
of
course,
they
got
into
more
trouble
there
but
they
didn't
get
any
trouble
in
birmingham.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
--
they
were
taken
into
custody
and
they
did
not
object.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
used
the
word
"arrest"
because
the
record
does
indicate
one
or
two
times
that
they
used
the
word
"arrest".
an
arrest,
as
i
--
it
would
be
taking
somebody
into
custody
for
violation
of
some
law
of
ordinance.
they
did
not
violate
the
law
of
ordinance
--
a
law
or
ordinance.
but
there
were
some
80
policemen
during
the
week
and
some
40
at
that
time
around
the
bus
station.
the
white
people
were
being
pushed
back.
they
were
on
private
property
and
on
the
streets
away
from
that.
nighttime
was
coming
and
reverend
shuttlesworth,
in
his
own
testimony,
says
that.
he
says
it
was
beginning
to
build
up.
now,
those
young
people,
they
didn't
object.
and
--
and
we're
entitled
to
the
--
to
the
inference
from
that.
they
didn't
object.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
for
their
own
protection.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
for
their
own
protection,
yes.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
now,
the
--
the
chief
is
not
a
lawyer.
he's
a
law
enforcement
officer
of
25-year
service,
but
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
and
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
and
he
was
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
he
took
them
into
custody,
yes,
sir.
he
took
them
into
custody.
and
he
was
enforcing
--
he
was
enforcing
the
duty
in
the
police
department
to
maintain
law
and
order.
now,
if
the
court
thinks
a
police
did
wrong,
i
would
like
for
them,
when
they
write
their
decision,
to
try
to
decide
what
should
the
police
had
done.
what
would
i
have
done
if
i
had
been
there
as
their
chief
of
police?
frankly,
i've
studied
--
i
thought
of
it
long
and
hard.
and
i
think
i'd
done
the
same
thing
if
it
occurred
to
me.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
protective
custody
is
a
--
is
a
--
pose
a
dangerous
thing.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
otherwise.
it
cannot
be
abused.
it
cannot
be
used
except
in
the
most
extreme
circumstances
and
i
would
say
that's
a
case
of
riot.
i
would
say
if
somebody
was
--
was
threatening
you,
you
should
not
be
taken
into
protective
custody,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
--
but
i
would
say
that
if
i
walked
into
new
york
city
and
went
down
into
an
area
there,
being
a
stranger
or
for
no
other
purpose
but
maybe
to
carry
a
sign,
"vote
for
wallace",
suppose
i
did
that
into
some
areas,
that
would
be
a
foolhardy
thing
to
do
in
summary.
and
i
think
the
--
the
police
should
protect
me
if
it
is
reasonable,
but
if
it's
not
reasonable,
they
should
escort
me
out
of
there.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
and
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
yes,
they
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
had
been
arresting
them
all
day.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
there
were
congregating
on
an
area
then
and
it
was
impossible
to
the
chief,
says
to
tell
who
--
who's
threatening
them,
who
made
the
threats.
the
police
did
not
arrest
anyone
at
that
particular
moment.
they
hadn't
arrested
them
prior
to
that,
they
arrested
them
after
that.
and
the
record
shows
that
other
arrests
were
made.
now
--
now
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
around
--
i
think
30
or
40.
now,
let
me
--
they
say
there's
no
evidence
of
guilt.
let
me
show
this.
chief
moore
says,
"i
told
him
to
leave.
he
got
between
me
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
to
leave.
that
is
in
one
place.
to
leave,
that
is
reverend
shuttlesworth.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
--
i
think
under
the
decisions
of
mr.
--
i
think
he
did.
i
think
on
the
circumstances,
under
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
decision
by
judge
lehman
in
new
york
in
people
versus
galfron.
and
under
the
--
which
was
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
and
under
edward
charles
taylor,
defendant,
state
versus
taylor,
i
think
he
did.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
if
there
had
been
no
riot
in
the
making,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
he
had
a
right
but
there
was
no
bus
leaving.
the
bus
drivers
had
refused
to
drive
the
buses.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
the
information
that
they
had
was
that
the
bus
drivers
were
not
going
to
drive
it
and
the
crowd
was
forming
and
nighttime
was
coming.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
there
is
record
in
there
that
they
could
not
get
a
bus
and
that
the
bus
--
so
that
the
bus
drivers
would
not
drive.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
there
was
scheduled
buses
to
run,
yes.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
and
they
were
there.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
and
intending
to
ride
that
bus
but
they
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
--
the
evidence
shows
that
--
that
they
could
not
get
a
bus
driver.
the
evidence
does
not
show
that
they
were
told
that.
but
let's
remember,
we
do
not
have
the
persons
taken
into
custody
before
this
court.
we
do
not
have
any
complaint
from
those
persons.
we
have
a
complaint
from
a
bystander
or
a
stranger
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
didn't.
they
were
not
arrested
because
they
did
not
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
no,
they
--
they
were
not.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
they
--
they
were
not
--
were
not
arrested.
now,
let
me
--
if
the
court
please,
let
me
go
through
the
evidence
it
shows
there
--
as
i
said,
the
chief
said
he
told
them
twice
to
leave.
and
chief
moore
says,
"he
was
in
my
way
and
he
was
asking
me
what
happened."
and
captain
garrison
says
he
stepped
between
the
chief
and
the
group
of
freedom
riders
and
i,
myself,
told
him
to
move
three
times.
he
was
told
to
move.
now,
we
submit
that
whether
the
chief
and
the
police
were
trying
to
maintain
law
and
order.
now,
whether
the
police
officers
had
a
right
--
i
mean
the
freedom
riders
had
a
right
to
complain
or
not
is
not
relevant
in
this
case.
that
police
officers
had
a
tense
situation
that
they
were
trying
to
control
and
they
were
trying
to
eliminate,
and
they
did.
and
we
go
further
and
we
find,
at
record
29,
they
couldn't
get
a
driver
to
take
the
bus
out.
did
he
refuse
to
leave?
he
did
not
by
leaving.
when
reverend
shuttlesworth
refused
to
--
to
leave
after
he
was
told
to
leave
and
captain
warren
says
their
chief
asked
him
to
get
out
of
the
way.
captain
warren
testified
to
what
the
chief
says.
and
we
--
we
don't
--
we
come
on
down
to
captain
warren
and
we
--
captain
garrison
and
we
find
in
one
place
of
the
record
there
where
the
defendant's
own
attorney
says,
"was
your
action
in
the
taking
the
freedom
riders
into
protected
custody
made
any
harder?"
of
course,
we
couldn't
have
answered
such
question.
clearly,
it
was
a
call
for
police
--
a
conclusion.
but
his
own
attorney
asked
him
that.
our
office
--
our
attorney
in
--
on
the
case
did
not
object
and
he
said,
"yes,
it
made
it
harder."
we
have
a
clear
case
of
interfering
and
hindering
the
police
in
this
situation.
now,
this
--
the
question
of
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
in
this
nature
is
such
that
the
police,
in
the
issuance
of
reasonable
directions
and
that
has
always
been
the
law,
the
question
to
determine
when
direction
should
be
issued
and
what
direction
as
long
as
they
were
reasonable.
and
these
were
reasonable.
the
question
of
the
validity
of
any
protective
arrest
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
defendant,
reverend
shuttlesworth,
could
have
cost
the
lives
of
police
officers
and
people
there.
now,
that's
not
farfetched
in
may
of
1951.
it
was
a
situation
that
was
occurring
in
this
--
in
the
south
that
they
did
later
on
without
publicity.
now,
that
--
that's
your
--
that's
your
danger
in
this
case,
is
the
publicity
that
was
given.
we
--
we
don't
know
where
it
came
from
but
the
publicity
that
was
given
that
they
were
coming
in
and
the
publicity
has
a
tendency
to
create
a
tense
situation.
and
law
and
order
is
like,
we
submit,
is
like
the
police
power.
except
in
this
--
and
it's
--
and
then
when
the
police
is
trying
to
enforce
law
and
order,
that
they
have
a
right
to
give
directions.
i
can
go
down
the
street
here
in
washington.
i
wouldn't
think
one
minute
of
disobeying
an
order
of
a
policeman
not
to
go
down
that
street
because
i
got
a
legal
right
to
go
down
there
under
the
law.
but
that
police
officer
said,
"go
this
way",
for
some
reason
that
he
may
know
and
i
don't
know.
i've
got
no
right
to
dispute
that.
and
that's
exactly
what
--
what
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
doing.
he
was
arguing,
he
was
discussing,
he
was
failing
three
times
and
he,
himself,
admits
twice
and
the
evidence
shows
three
times
that
he
was
asked
to
leave.
all
he
had
to
do
was
go
to
another
place
in
the
bus
station.
now,
the
action
of
the
police
is
shown
by
the
success,
the
success
it
had.
it
did
not
--
it
did
not
result
in
a
riot
like
it
did
in
montgomery.
it
did
not
result
in
harm.
it
did
not
completely
prohibit
there
--
their
going
to
montgomery
and
that
they
did
go
--
did
go
at
a
--
at
a
later
time.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
was--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
was
coming
to
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
was
not
sustained
on
the
ground.
in
other
words,
arkansas
case,
they
were
convicted
under
one
section
of
a
law
and
charged
on
another.
this
is
not
the
case.
our
city
code
gives
us
the
right
of
election.
the
hindering
of
a
--
the
hindering
of
a
police
officer,
interfering
with
a
police
officer,
includes
assault.
and
of
course,
if
i
walk
up
to
a
police
officer
and
hold
off
and
hit
him
while
he
is
trying
to
perform
a
duty,
directing
traffic
even,
i
am
interfering
with
him
in
the
operation
of
his
duty.
we
have
never
argued
there
was
an
assault
in
this
case,
but
we
do
argue
that
assault
is
within
the
--
this
section
of
the
code.
and
under
section
6
of
our
city
code,
we
have
the
right
of
election.
the
charge
was
interfering
with
the
police
officer.
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
included
in
that
charge
is
assault
and
he
was
guilty
of
assault.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
because
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
necessarily
based
on
the
opinion
but
is
based
on
the
judgment
which
says,
"it
is,
therefore,
considered
that
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
be,
in
all
things,
affirmed."
now,
we
will
--
we
submit
that
he
was
hindering
the
police
officer
and
we
must
as
a
--
and
this
is
distinguished
from
the
--
from
the
south
carolina
case
because,
in
that
case,
from
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
in
that
case,
it
said
there
had
been
--
there
was
no
evidence
there's
threat
and
violence
if
the
police
did
not
move.
there
was
no
evidence
saying
that
at
all.
we
have
here
evidence
of
threatened
violence.
the
south
carolina
case
does
not
come
within
it.
and
if
we
do
not,
we
--
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
case
furnishes
a
vehicle
for
this
court
to
let
the
police
officers
of
this
nation
know
that
they
can
enforce
law
and
order
and
that
the
soldiers
are
not
going
to
patrol
our
streets.
and
i
would
like
to
go
to
a
statement
that
mr.
justice
jackson
made,
and
i
am
aware
it's
in
a
dissenting
opinion
but
some
mighty
good
law
has
been
made
in
dissenting
opinions.
and,
if
i
can
find
it,
he
made
the
--
he
made
a
statement.
he
says,
"silence
in
the
speaker
by
authorities
as
a
measure
of
mob
control
is
like
dynamiting
a
house
to
stop
the
spread
of
conflagration,
but
this
kind
of
disorder
does
not
abridge
the
right
to
speak
except
in
an
emergency."
that's
khans
versus
new
york.
now,
of
course,
dynamiting
a
house
takes
a
constitutional
right.
stopping
these
white
people
from
coming
out,
hey
had
a
legal
right
to
walk
into
that
bus
station
and
walk
up
and
down
there.
stopping
them
took
that
constitutional
rights,
in
a
way,
away
from
it.
but
law
and
order
must
prevail.
in
this
case,
it
did
prevail
and
there
was
no
riot
like
they
had
in
montgomery.
there
is
no
riot
like
it
had
in
places
in
the
north.
the
--
the
issue
was
handled
by
the
police
and
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
like
striking
a
match
close
to
a
gas,
open
gasoline.
now,
that's
what
his
actions
constituted.
and
we
--
we
think
that
this
court
should
recognize
that
there's
nothing,
of
course,
constitutional
rights
are
important.
they
are
the
foundation
of
this
nation
but
they
should
not,
should
not
be
used
to
destroy
law
and
order
because
once
law
and
order
is
destroyed,
there
is
no
other
rights.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
the
court
--
court
of
appeals
based
that
on
common
law,
on
common
law
theory
of
assault
that
--
that
his
actions
constituted
a
threat.
i
would
not
disagree
with
them.
i
would
not
and
i
have
not
made
that
a
cardinal
point
of
my
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
i
think
it
constitutes
a
threat
to
interference
of
the
action
and
i
would
go
with
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
boiled
down
to
that.
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
no,
we
have
--
i
don't
know
about
the
assault
section
but
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
--
but
we
have
a
section
in
the
city
code
which
says
that
we
can
in
--
that
montgomery
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
mr.
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
well,
an
assault,
that
would
be
a
question
of
fight,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
if
a
man
assaults
an
officer,
he's
interfering
with
--
mr.
j.
m.
breckenridge
he's
interfering
with
his
performance
of
his
duties,
if
he's
performing
duties
at
that
time.
and
section
6
of
the
general
city
code
gives
us
a
right
of
election,
which
the
city
did
elect
in
this
case.
thank
you,
sir.
