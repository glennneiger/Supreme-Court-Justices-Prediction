chief

mr.
breckenridge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
supreme
court
there
ever
waived
that
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
cited
by
mr.
greenberg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
humanity
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
mr.
greenberg
held
up
a
document
here
a
little
while
ago
which
would
show
that
the
ordinary
legal
size
paper
was
stapled
on
to
the
--
to
the
larger
size
paper
that's
required
by
your
court
and
i
understood
him
to
say
that
was
--
was
recognized
in
the
court,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
he
showed
us
some
documents
that
he
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was
used.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
court
would
--
would
permit
them
to
do
that,
to
staple
ordinary-sized
legal
paper
onto
this
larger
paper
in
some
instances,
do
you
think
that
the
rule
would
be
serious
enough
to
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
should
deny
a
constitutional
hearing
a
constitutional
right
because
something
of
that
kind
was
not
done
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what's
the
arrest
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you
yourself
said
it
--
you,
yourself,
said
they
were
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
knows
whether
he's
making
an
arrest
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
police
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
police
arrest
any
of
the
white
people
who
were
threatening
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
violence
against
these
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
said
at
that
time,
in
this
case,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
officers
did
you
have
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
told
him
to
leave?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
have
a
right
to
tell
him
to
leave
the
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
--
wasn't
he
entitled
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
he
entitled
to
be
in
that
place
to
catch
a
bus
which
he
intended
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
he
--
how
did
he
know
that
--
that
none
of
the
bus
drivers
would
come
in
for
the
future
trips?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
told
this
or
that
those
freedom
riders
were
told
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
a
scheduled
bus
to
--
to
run,
was
there
not,
within
a
reasonable
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
were
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
intending
to
ride
on
the
trip.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
told
--
were
they
told,
any
of
them,
that
--
that
no
bus
drivers
would
come
and
that
therefore,
it
was
--
there
was
no
necessity
for
them
remaining
in
there
that
the
place
was
closed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
didn't
get
six
months
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
fined,
that
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
subject
them
to
60
or
more
days,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
breckenridge,
in
the
(inaudible)
the
question
of
the
assault.
now,
your
--
your
court
of
appeals
apparently
say
--
said
that
this
man
had
committed
an
assault.
suppose
we
cannot
sustain
you
on
any
other
grounds
than
that
he
did
make
an
assault.
do
you
say
that
now
that
he
did
make
an
assault?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
we
could
rest
this
case
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
we
--
suppose
we
have
to
make
it
a
basic
consideration
in
the
case,
do
you
--
do
you
say
it
is
an
assault
or
it
is
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greenberg.
