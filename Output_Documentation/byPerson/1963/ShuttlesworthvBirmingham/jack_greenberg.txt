mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court
in
alabama.
petitioner
asserts
denial
of
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
him
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
refused
to
review
the
case
on
the
ground
that
petitioner's
petition
was
filed
on
the
wrong-sized
paper.
that
is
an
ordinary
legal
cap
paper
instead
of
the
folio
paper
which
is
in
this
record
here.
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
for
violating
section
856
of
the
birmingham
city
code
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
and
this
provision
briefly
provides
that
any
person
who
knowingly
opposes
or
resists
any
officer
in
executing
or
attempting
to
make
any
lawful
arrest
or
in
the
discharge
of
any
legal
duty,
and
so
forth,
shall,
on
conviction,
be
punished
as
--
for
a
misdemeanor.
the
charge
brought
against
petitioner
was
essentially
in
the
language
of
the
ordinance
and
the
charge
appears
on
page
4
of
our
brief
and
it
charge
that
petitioner
did
knowingly
and
willfully
interfere
with
and
hinder
the
chief
of
police
in
the
discharge
of
his
legal
duty.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
however,
affirmed
on
the
ground,
as
petitioner
reads
it,
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
petitioner
violated
section
856
because,
as
appears
on
page
60
of
the
record,
it
held,
he
had
violated
another
section,
section
825,
which
we
--
with
which
he
had
never
been
charged
and
that
is
the
section
making
an
assault
of
crime.
and
it
said
that
in
as
much
as
shuttlesworth
blocked
the
chief's
path
using
words
from
which
the
intent
to
do
so
in
rudeness
or
anger
could
probably
and
rationally
be
inferred,
there
was
no
error
in
his
conviction
since
he
could
have
been
clearly
convicted
of
a
simple
assault.
the
petitioner's
first
conviction
here
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
below
and
that
is
no
evidence
either
under
section
856
because
petitioner,
first
of
all,
we
submit,
did
not
interfere
with
anyone
and
secondly,
we
submit,
the
police
were
not
in
the
exercise
of
any
lawful
duty.
and
third,
if
the
question
of
the
crime
of
assault
is
in
the
case,
as
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals.
there
was
no
assault
under
alabama
law
as
it
has
been
stated
heretofore
because,
as
we
read
the
alabama
cases,
there
is
either
a
requirement
of
violence
or
an
--
an
attempt
to
commit
violence
of
some
sort.
or
under
the
alabama
law
of
assault,
as
it
has
been
defined
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
as
involving
some
ingredient
of
rudeness
and
anger
because
on
this
record,
in
the
words
of
the
state's
own
witnesses,
there
was
neither
rudeness
nor
anger.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
was
just
about
to
come
to
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
facts
are
not
seriously
disputed.
there
is
some
slight
dispute
between
the
parties
but,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
will
accept
the
statement
of
the
facts
as
given
by
the
police
and
most
favorable
to
the
state.
may
17th,
1961,
the
freedom
riders,
which
i
believe
need
not
be
further
described
as
the
well-recognized
acts
that
occurred
around
that
time,
the
freedom
riders
were
in
the
birmingham
bus
terminal.
some
of
them
had
come
from
nashville
to
birmingham
and
were
on
route
to
montgomery,
alabama.
some
of
the
freedom
riders
were
birmingham
residents
and
they
were
joining
the
national
group
and
they
were
going
to
montgomery,
alabama.
all
of
the
group
had
tickets,
including
the
petitioner.
he
had
a
ticket
and
he
had
a
suitcase.
the
chief
of
police
came
up
to
the
group,
and
on
page
15
and
16
of
the
record,
what
he
said
appears.
i'll
rapidly
go
through
his
testimony,
he
said,
"when
i
got
over
to
the
bus
station,
i
went
through
the
bus
station
with
some
other
officers
and
some
superior
officers,
i
believe
captain
wall
and
so
forth.
and
i
went
out
and
told
that
group,
that
is
the
freedom
riders,
that
group
of
people
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
who
i
was.
i
identified
myself
and
told
them
that
due
to
circumstances
that
day
that
i,
as
chief
of
police,
was
arresting
them
and
taking
them
into
protective
custody
of
the
city
of
birmingham.
then,
he
said
shuttlesworth
came
over.
now,
this
is
the
only
dispute
in
the
record.
it's
not
terribly
material.
he
said
shuttlesworth
came
over
from
a
distance
away
and
interjected
himself.
there,
shuttlesworth
maintains
he
was
there
all
the
time
and
indeed,
a
captain
of
the
police
and
a
police
officer
also
testified
that
shuttlesworth
was
with
the
group
all
the
time.
but
the
dispute
is
whether
shuttlesworth
interjected
himself
or
had
been
there.
anyway,
he
said,
"shuttlesworth
came
over
and
i
called
him
fred,
that
--
called
him
by
his
name.
i
called
him
fred.
i
said
he
was
not
concerned
with
what
ws
happening
there
and
he
walked
around
and
got
between
me
and
some
of
those
people.
and
i
asked
him
again
to
go
and
he
said
if
those
people
have
to
be
arrested,
why,
he
wanted
to
be
arrested
also."
now,
the
chief
said
this
on
page
25
of
the
record.
this
took
a
very
few
minutes.
there
is
a
police
officer
who
testified
and
took
about
a
few
seconds.
that
was
the
entire
transaction.
that
was
what
supposed
to
have
consisted
of
interfering
with
the
police
officer
in
the
exercise
of
his
lawful
duty
and
then,
later,
this
is
supposed
to
have
been
an
assault.
chief
testified
shuttlesworth
was
not
loud,
he
was
not
profane,
he
was
not
violent,
and
i
think
one
thing
that
is
absolutely
clear
about
this
case
is
that
there
was
no
violence,
no
threat
of
violence,
no
aggressive
conduct
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner
with
the
group
with
which
he
was
at
all.
they
submitted
immediately
to
arrest.
they
were
arrested
and
they
were
taken
away.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
alabama
court
of
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
wouldn't
consider
the
charge
because
they
said
it
was
in
the
--
the
petition
said
it
was
on
the
wrong-sized
paper
and
that's
something
i
hope
to
discuss
in
a
few
moments.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
the
lang
--
i
think
the
language
would
have
to
be
read
because,
to
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
not
entirely
clear.
in
part,
it
seems
to
indicate
that
since
the
penalty
for
assault
and
for
interfering
with
the
police
officer
in
the
exercise
of
a
lawful
duty
are
the
same,
it
really
didn't
matter
if
he
was
guilty
of
it.
in
part,
there
seems
to
be
intimation
that
this
is
an
included
offense
in
the
doctrine
of
interfering
with
a
police
officer.
and
this
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
very
brief.
i
could
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
59
and
60
of
the
record.
now,
it's
our
--
our
first
argument
that,
heretofore,
we
have
been
unable
to
find
in
alabama
law
any
such
doctrine
as
protective
custody,
that
the
police
were
not
in
the
exercise
of
any
lawful
duty
when
they
were
taking
someone
into
protective
custody.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
defines
protective
custody,
and
this
is
for
the
first
time,
as
taking
someone
into
custody
when
he
voluntarily
submits
to
it.
but
if
anything
is
clear,
these
freedom
riders
had
not
voluntarily
submitted
to
be
taken
into
protective
custody.
they
were
arrested
and
so
there
was
no
voluntary
taking
into
custody.
and
secondly,
i
think
it's
clear
that
shuttlesworth
did
not
interfere.
he
was
speaking
to
the
police
officer,
in
the
testimony
of
different
witnesses,
from
a
few
seconds
to
a
few
minutes
and
he
was
merely
very
politely
inquiring
as
to
what
was
going
on.
he
was
with
the
group
and
he
wanted
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
said,
"i
was
with
them,
if
you're
going
to
arrest
them,
you
have
to
arrest
me,
too."
i
--
that,
of
course,
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
your
honor,
that
curiously
was
exactly
the
same
thing
that
was
the
fact
in
taylor
against
louisiana
which
this
court
reversed.
the
freedom
riders
were
there
and
they
said
that,
well,
they
had
to
be
arrested.
they
were
willing
to
agree
to
be
arrested
when
confronted
with
the
fact
that,
apparently,
there
was
no
alternative
to
it.
and
shuttlesworth's
position,
i'd
just
like
to
briefly
read
from
the
taylor
case,
the
spokesman
said,
"we
have
no
choice.
go
ahead
and
arrest
us."
now,
it's
essentially
what
happened.
the
language
differs
only
very
slightly.
that
bit
of
rhetoric
under
those
circumstances
doesn't
constitute
a
crime.
and
i
don't
think
that
he
could've
been
charged
and
convicted
of
a
crime
for
having
said
in
that
situation,
"i'm
with
them.
treat
me
the
same
way
you
treat
them",
but
there
was
no
reason
to
treat
anyone
in
this
way.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
they
say
that
--
that
constituted
an
interference.
it's
a
--
an
--
but
it
had
to
be
an
interference
in
the
exercise
of
a
lawful
duty.
i
think
it's
obvious,
there
was
no
lawful
duty
being
carried
out
here
and
--
and
we
would
submit
that
this
doesn't
constitute
an
interference.
it
was
a,
"just
a
moment.
what's
happening
there?"
and
to
merely
ask
a
question
of
a
police
officer.
the
people
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
freedom
riders
had
already
been
arrested
at
this
point.
the
--
the
duty,
the
lawful
du
--
the
duty
of
the
police
or
whatever
they
were
doing
had
already
been
consummated.
they
were
under
arrest,
at
this
point,
when
shuttlesworth
said,
"what
is
happening
here?"
mr.
jack
greenberg
what
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
will
say,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
the
opinion
is
not
clear
to
me.
that,
on
the
one
hand,
it
appears
to
be
that
he
was
not
harmed
in
any
way
because
he
also
committed
an
assault
and
the
penalty
is
the
same.
on
page
60,
they
use
assault
as
an
offense
included
in
856,
and
that's
at
the
second
end
of
the
second
full
paragraph,
and
so
they
say
both.
but
that's
the
argument
in
cole
against
arkansas
that
we
made.
i
think
this
case
is
clearly
under
cole,
but
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
this
court
doesn't
really
even
have
to
reach
the
cole
question
because
in
cole
against
arkansas,
this
court
remanded
it
to
the
state
supreme
court
for
reconsideration
as
to
what
section
the
man
was
convicted
under.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
reconsidered
it
and
reaffirmed
and
then
this
court
affirmed,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here
because
there's
no
evidence
to
convict
under
interfering
in
the
exercise
of
a
lawful
duty.
there
was
no
lawful
duty
and
we
submit
there
was
no
interference.
and
there
was
no
assault
either
in
the
old
sense,
as
we
read
the
alabama
cases,
or
in
the
new
sense
of
rudeness
and
anger
because
the
testimony
of
the
state's
own
witnesses
says
that
there
was
neither
rudeness
nor
anger
here.
he
was
--
he
was
quite
polite.
in
any
event,
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
not
consider
this
because
they
said
it
was
filed
on
the
wrong-sized
paper.
now,
alabama
uses
folio
paper
for
records
and
it
has
a
rule
which
requires
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
be
filed
on
folio
paper.
and
this
is
a
folio
paper
here
and
this
paper
is
eight
and
a
half
by
fourteen
and
--
i'm
sorry,
this
paper
is
ten
and
a
half
by
sixteen
and
a
half
and
the
ordinary
legal
cap
that's
used
in
most
other
courts
and
is
also
used
for
other
purposes
in
alabama
is
eight
and
a
half
by
fourteen
and
a
half.
this
paper
is
two
inches
larger
in
each
dimension.
i
may
say
that
petitions
for
rehearing
under
alabama
law,
there's
a
case,
redwine
versus
state,
in
our
brief,
are
filed
in
ordinary
legal
cap
paper.
petitions
for
rehearing
are
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
filing
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
petitions
for
rehearing
are
filed
on
legal
--
legal
cap
and
then
that
is
stapled
to
this
paper,
as
here
in
this
record.
the
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
also
are
customarily
written
on
legal
cap
and
stapled
to
the
record,
but
we
don't
deny
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
be
placed
on
transcript
paper.
our
position
concerning
this
rule
is,
however,
that
the
rule
itself,
while
it
is
a
rule
tended
to
be
obeyed,
it
has
been
adopted
because
there
are
racks
of
a
certain
size
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
and
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
case,
ex
parte
nation,
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
that
this
sized
paper
fits
those
sized
racks
and
also
this
sized
paper
is
less
prone
to
rot.
despite
the
fact
that
nevertheless
the
smaller
sized
paper
is
stapled
into
this
sized
paper
for
several
purposes.
our
position
is
that
the
rule
though
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes,
there's
the
type
--
it's
typing
--
typewriting,
it's
the
same
size.
we
submit
that
this
--
that
while
this
is
a
rule
and
it's
a
rule
that's
meant
to
be
obeyed,
if
the
rule
itself
is
--
the
requirement
that
it
be
obeyed
is
so
arbitrary
in
what
--
as
to
the
federal
claim
that
is
presented
that
when
petitioner
fails
to
abide
by
this
rule,
his
federal
claim
ought
not
to
be
stricken.
this
case
is
like
other
cases
this
court
has
decided.
rogers
against
alabama
was
a
case
in
which
alabama
refused
to
consider
a
federal
claim
because
the
pleading
was
prolix.
that's
a
state
rule
that
ought
to
be
obeyed.
the
question
was,
should
failure
to
obey
the
state
rule
--
can
--
can
failure
to
obey
the
state
rule
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
federal
question.
this
court
said,
no,
it
could
not
consider
the
federal
question.
another
case
is
staub
against
baxley,
a
much
more
recent
case
which
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
that
when
you
attack
an
ordinance,
you
must
point
out
the
particular
sections
of
the
ordinance
you
are
attacking.
you
can't
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinances
as
a
whole.
while
that
may
be
a
perfectly
valid
rule,
for
purposes
of
state
law,
this
court
said
that
the
rule
under
the
circumstances
was
an
arid
and
formalistic
ritual
and
failure
to
obey
it
could
not
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
federal
question.
another
case,
a
very
early
case,
carter
against
texas,
is
a
case
in
which
the
petitioner
had
not
submitted
a
witness
list
setting
forth
the
names
of
the
witnesses
he
would
have
called
to
support
his
constitutional
claim
of
jury
discrimination.
this
court
said
that,
again,
perfectly
valid
state
rule
but
that
does
not
preclude
this
court.
it
is
--
this
court
decides
what
is
the
proper
way
to
raise
federal
questions
for
this
court.
moreover,
this
is
a
rule
of
the
alabama
courts
themselves,
it
was
not
imposed
by
legislation.
and
the
alabama
courts
have
waived
rules
like
this
and
even
this
rule
and
comparable
rules
under
various
--
in
various
situations.
in
ex
parte
wood,
a
case
cited
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
that
was
a
mandamus
case,
mandamus
also
must
be
filed
in
this
large-sized
paper.
and
the
court
went
into
a
very
extensive
consideration
of
the
merits
and
then
it
said,
"another
reason
is
that
we
--
we
reject
the
claim
because
it's
on
the
wrong-sized
paper".
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
houston
against
state
and
ex
parte
nations
are
cases
in
which
this
court
did
consider
the
claims
before
it
on
the
wrong-sized
paper.
the
nations
case,
a
very
recent
decision
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
has
an
intimation
that
it's
based
in
forma
pauperis
type
considerations
that
there
was
a
prisoner
who
--
where
there
was
no
indication
that
he
could
have
obtained
the
larger
paper,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
adopted
this
exception
shows
that
it
is
a
rule
which
under
circumstances
which
the
court
considers
proper,
may
dispense
with.
their
requirements
under
alabama
law
that
a
litigant
must
bind
his
exceptions
into
the
--
his
assignments
of
error
into
the
transcript
at
the
time
of
submission.
and
there's
a
case,
mitchell
v.
helms,
that
we
cite
in
which
they
permitted
him
to
write
his
exceptions
on
the
transcript
afterwards.
many,
many
cases
have
made
--
have
excused
failure
to
follow
the
rules
recording
--
requiring
the
writing
of
briefs.
there
are
certain
rules
of
how
briefs
should
be
written
and
the
alabama
courts
have
frequently
excused
violations
of
that
rule.
so
the
alabama
court
has
excused
violations
of
rules
like
this
and
has
considered
the
merits
in
cases
in
which
the
plea
has
been
submitted
on
the
wrong-sized
paper.
and
we
submit
in
this
court
in
williams
against
georgia
held
that
where
a
court
has
discretion,
as
here,
the
fact
that
it
did
not
exercise
its
discretion
in
favor
of
a
petitioner
does
not
preclude
this
court
from
considering
a
valid
constitutional
claim.
moreover,
we
cite
at
the
conclusion
of
our
brief
a
recent
decision
of
this
court,
hammerstein
against
superior
court,
in
which
this
court
was
faced
with
a
--
an
issue
arising
from
the
denial
of
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california.
the
state
supreme
court
had
refused
to
hear
the
case
on
adequate
state
ground
and
this
court
held
that
it
--
since
it
--
what
it
had
before
was
the
judgment
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court
it
had
jurisdiction.
it
declined
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
on
other
grounds,
but
it
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
so
we
submit
that
there
is
no
evidence
upon
which
any
of
these
charges
rest,
either
the
charges
which
he
originally
was
tried
or
those
which
were
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
state
supreme
court.
then,
under
the
doctrine
of
cole
against
arkansas,
it
was
denial
of
due
process
to
affirm
on
a
ground
which
there
was
no
notice
in
the
court
below
and
that
the
issues
are
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
it
requires
an
appraisal
of
--
of
the
facts
of
just
what
happened
here.
on
page
40
of
the
record,
one
of
the
police
officers
who
testified
for
the
states
said
this
entire
transaction
took
a
couple
of
seconds.
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
40.
and
on
page
25,
the
chief
himself
said
it
was
a
very
few
minutes.
everybody
agrees
it
was
just
a
moment.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
an
interference
with
the
police
for
someone
who
is
a
member
of
a
group
to
come
over
and
in
the
--
a
matter
of
seconds
really
or
moment
or
two
at
the
most,
to
make
an
inquiry
as
to
what
is
occurring,
especially
one
that
is
apparent,
as
it
was
here,
that
the
police
were
acting
entirely
in
an
unlawful
manner,
certainly
without
lawful
authority.
i
--
i
think
that
if
something
like
this
had
gone
on
and
it
developed
into
a
harangue
or
a
wrangle,
you
would
reach
a
point
in
which
it
would
reach
the
--
perhaps
the
dignity
of
--
of
an
interference.
but
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
of
the
sort
for
that
momentary
encounter
and
inquiry.
i
should
think
any
citizen
has
a
right
to
inquire
of
a
police
officer
as
to
what
he's
doing.
mr.
jack
greenberg
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
clear
up
two
brief
points.
first
of
all,
when
these
freedom
riders
with
whom
shuttlesworth
was
associated
with,
were
arrested,
they
were
all
--
they
were
placed
in
jail
for
12
hours
but
this
was
not
merely
a
question
of
taking
them
out
of
the
presence
of
a
mob
that
allegedly
was
about
to
attack
them.
they
were
actually
placed
in
jail
for
a
period
of
12
hours.
secondly
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
and
that's
on
page
54
of
the
record.
secondly,
shuttlesworth
--
if
this
was
for
their
protection,
the
question
then
arises,
why
weren't
they
protecting
shuttlesworth?
shuttlesworth
was
a
freedom
rider.
he
was
part
of
the
group.
he
had
a
ticket.
he
had
a
suitcase.
he
was
going
with
them.
he
--
that
incidentally,
is
brought
out
even
more
fully
in
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief.
he
was
charged,
at
the
same
time,
for
another
crime,
conspiracy
to
cause
a
mob
to
gather
and
that
was
reversed
in
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
at
157
2d
763.
and
that
makes
even
more
clear
what
also
appears
in
this
record,
that
this
was
one
large
group
of
which
shuttlesworth
also
was
a
member.
but
they
protected
the
group
and
they
arrested
shuttlesworth
for
--
apparently
just
being
a
member
of
the
group.
as
to
the
question
of
assault
being
an
included
offense,
cole
against
arkansas
and
other
cases
are
based
on
the
principle
that,
if
one
is
charged
with
a
crime,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
defend
against
it.
he
could've
presented
evidence
to
indicate
there
was
no
assault.
he
could
have
argued
to
the
court
below.
he
could've
briefed
the
fact
that
there
was
no
assault
and
indeed,
there
was
no
assault.
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
based
upon
a
clear
misapprehension
of
the
record
concerning
rudeness
and
anger.
and
if
there
were
some
notice
that
this
was
to
be
a
prosecution
for
assault,
either
as
a
separate
offense
or
as
an
included
offense,
there
could
have
been
a
defense
against
assault.
but
the
first
notice
anybody
had
of
that
was
in
the
affirmance
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
no
evidence
point
is
the
dominant
point
here.
there
is
no
point
in
sending
the
case
back
to
the
alabama
courts
for
a
reconsideration
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
assault
or
there
was
interference
with
the
police
officer
in
the
exercise
of
his
duty,
simply
because
there
is
no
evidence
of
either.
in
any
way,
it
is
defined,
any
way
that
these
various
crimes
are
defined,
either
as
heretofore
or
as
defined
for
the
first
time,
as
do
some
of
them,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
