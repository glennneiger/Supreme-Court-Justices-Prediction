(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
--
i
find
it
difficult
to
separate
the
two
unless
you
separate
marching
and
patrolling
around
the
place
or
building
on
a
public
street
from
speech
itself,
so
you
have
a
right
to
be
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
stating
what
you
mean
by
picketing?
i
--
that's
my
trouble.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
concurred
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
a
number
of
years
ago
where
distinction
was
drawn.
do
you
refer
to
picketing
as
marching
and
patrolling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
raises
a
serious
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that,
to
me,
is
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
it
just
affecting
under
authority
of
state
law
which
said
“in
this
city,
marching
round
and
round
the
building
is
permitted
in
order
to
communicate
ideas.”
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
conclude
this
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
could
occupy
the
streets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
take
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
federal
statute
said
there'd
be
no
publicity
in
the
papers
on
this
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
point
i
have,
which
i
hope
both
of
them
will
be
discussed,
what
you
get
through
is
this.
i
draw
a
distinction
for
myself,
and
have
in
all
the
cases
which
i've
ever
agreed,
between
the
constitutional
right
to
march
in
front
of
people's
places
round
and
round
and
round,
whether
one
or
a
thousand,
the
constitutional
right
to
publish
your
views
at
those
places
if
you
have
a
right
to
be
there.
that's
the
--
i
drew
that
distinction
in
giboney.
giboney
was
on
conduct.
it
was
not
on
speech.
it
was
an
integrated
thing
of
that
law.
and,
i
have
not
agreed
to
any
opinion
in
this
court,
that
i
know
of,
that
ever
said
it
violates
the
constitution
of
united
states
for
a
city
or
a
state
to
pass
laws
that
people
shall
not
march
round
and
round
one
person's
home
or
his
place
of
business
on
the
streets.
justice
hugo
l.
black
forbidding
them
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
forbidding
them
to
do
it,
that's
right.
i
asked
if
in
the
--
the
first
thing
i
asked
for,
the
view
has
not
been
argued
and
it's
usually
passed
over
with
the
statement
that
this
court
has
agreed
through
the
years,
citing
certain
cases,
that
the
constitution
fully
protects
the
right
to
picket,
meaning
by
that,
the
right
to
march
around
and
around
somebody's
place
of
business
on
the
public
streets.
but,
there
are
other
cases
which
have
limited
that
through
the
constitution
forbidding
prohibition
of
a
person
to
say
what
he
wants
to
say
at
the
publisher's
view
when
he
is
where
he
has
a
right
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i
meant
either
forbidding
or
permitting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
public
streets.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it's
--
it's
usually
been
treated
as
though,
when
you
say
the
constitution
protects
free
speech,
you're
saying
the
constitution
protects
people's
right
to
go
somewhere
where
the
law
validly
forbids
them
to
go.
and,
that
has
never
appealed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
(inaudible)
for
certain
claims,
the
other
way,
yet,
you
view
the
same
as
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
the
whole,
as
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
fact
to
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
think
would
--
what
facts
do
you
think
would
have
to
be
open
to
show
that
there
was
a
threat?
take
that
word
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
congress
was
saying
that
picketing
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
opposing
clause
just
pure
communication,
you
are
drawing
a
distinction,
as
i
understand
it,
between
a
pure
communication,
the
right
to
communicate
ideas
and
the
right
to
be
at
some
place
where
you
might
communicate
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
involves,
as
i
understood
we
decide
in
thornhill,
namely,
a
statute
so
broad
and
so
all-inclusive,
nobody
can
tell
what
it
mean
and
how
it
would
be
applied
to
restrict
free
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think,
as
construed
by
them,
you
think
it
would
be
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
thornhill
did
hold
clearly,
without
any
doubt
did,
that
in
these
days,
in
these
times,
if
there
is
a
distinction
between
having
a
right
to
discuss
affairs
that
are
public
and
affairs
that
are
private
as
labor
disputes
involve
matters
of
such
great
importance
to
the
public,
the
first
amendment
could
protect
said
instruction.
