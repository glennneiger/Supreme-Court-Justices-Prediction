mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
two
cases
that
are
here
on
certiorari
to
review
judgments
of
the
two
courts
of
appeals
involving
the
application
of
the
recent
amendments
of--
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
union
concerted
activities
at
retail
stores
independently
on
selling
the
goods
of
an
employer
produced
by
an
employer
who
has
been
engaged
and
is
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute
with
the
union.
in
the
instant
case,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
to
picket
the
retail
store
with
signs
asking
consumers
not
to
purchase
a
product
made
by
another
employer,
in
this
case
several
hundred
miles
away,
with
whom
the
union
had
a
labor
dispute.
in
the
case
next
to
be
argued,
the
servette
case,
the
question
is
whether
the
union
may
request
the
manager
of
one
of
the
retail
stores
not
to
purchase
from
the
primary
employer,
as
we
call
him,
the
one
with
whom
it
has
the
dispute.
and,
second,
if
it
refuses,
whether
the
union
may
pass
out
hand
bills,
otherwise,
without
picketing,
request
the
consumers
not
to
purchase
those
products.
we
say
that
the
case
involving
picketing
does
involve
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
the
case
involving
the
request
directed
to
the
managers
of
the
store
and
to
the
passing
out
hand
bills
and
other
forms
of
publicity
does
not
involve
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
rather
nice
distinction
results,
we
contend,
from
the
language
of
the
statute
and
is
not
one
simply--
and
this
one
made
by
congress
rather
than
one
to
be
made
independently.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
there's
no
placard,
that
would
not,
i
think,
have
been
regarded
as
picketing.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
seems
to
have
been
what
congress
regarded
as
dispositive,
whether
there
was
patrolling
with
the
sign.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say--
i
would
say
it
wasn't
a
sign,
but
if
you
wish
to
call
it
a
sign
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would--
well,
if
it's
patrolling
and
handing
out--
there
might
be
room
for
argument
as
to
which
it
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recognized
it's
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
a
closed
line
and,
as
the
statute
has
drawn,
since
it
speaks
of
publicity
other
than
picketing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
does
not
define
picketing.
mr.
archibald
cox
or
that
they
are
carrying
a
placard
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
patrolling.
there
were
various
references
in
the
debate
to
ambulatory
picketing
and
that
that
was
what
was
forbidden.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
one,
as
i
said
before,
i
hesitate
to
say
clearly
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
think
that
was
a
question
for
the
board
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
we
don't
have
any
ambulatory
passing
out.
well,
i
mean,
as
walking.
it
was
one
that
came
into
the
congressional
debate
several
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
probably
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
it's
just
that
there's
a
nice
line
here
that
i
can't
answer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suggested
in
this
case,
it
is
agreed
that
there
was
picketing,
the
first
case.
and,
in
the
second
case,
it
is
agreed
that
there
was
no
picketing.
mr.
archibald
cox
and,
therefore,
we
are
not
under
the
ne
--
as
i
understand
it,
therefore,
we
are
not
under
the
necessity
of
dealing
with
some
of
these
nice
borderline
cases.
i
think
the
short
time
that
i
have
this
afternoon
could
be
best
spent
if
i
said
just
a
few
words
about
the
evolution
of
the
statutory
provision
involved
in
these
two
cases,
and
i'll
recall
the
particular
practice
of
this
case
again
tomorrow
morning
when
we
come
to
deal
with
it
precisely.
and,
i
think
you'll
find
it
most
convenient,
in
both
these
cases,
to
refer
to
a
very
slim
gray
document
numbers
88
and
111,
which
we
have
distributed
as
a
comparative
print
of
the
taft-hartley
version
of
this
section,
comparing
it
with
the
set
of
the
provisions
added
in
1959.
the
parts
of
section
8
(b)(4)
that
we're
concerned
with
have
always
dealt
with
secondary
boycotts.
that
is
to
say,
with
union
activities
in
which
there
are
two
employers.
the
so-called
primary
employer
with
whom
the
union
has
its
dispute,
here,
the
packer
of
these
apples,
and
a
secondary
employer,
a
neutral
employer
in
the
sense
that
he
has
no
interest
in
the
dispute
who
may
be
distributing
the
goods,
as
here,
or
may
have
some
other
connection,
maybe
a
supplier
of
the
primary
employer.
he
is
usually
called
the
secondary
employer.
in
our
print,
the
taft-hartley
version
is
set
forth
in
roman
type
and
you'll
notice
the
gist
of
those
parts
that
we're
concerned
with
“where
making
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
induce,”
on
page
2,
“or
encourage
the
employees
of
any
employer,”
and
then,
we
skip
the
italics,
“to
engage
in
certain
kinds
of
conduct.”
and,
this
is
important
in
the
servette
case,
“to
engage
in
a
strike
or
a
concerted
refusal,
in
the
course
of
their
employment,
to
use,
manufacture,
process,
transport,
or
otherwise,
work
on
or
handle
any
goods
or
s
--
materials
or
to
perform
any
services
that
deals
with
refusals
to
render
employment
services.”
and
then,
skipping
to
b
--
skipping
down
to
the
--
“where
an
object
thereof
is,”
skipping
over
to
b,
“forcing
or
requiring
any
other
--
any
employer
or
other
person
to
cease
dealing
with
the
primary
employer,”
so
that
you
always
have
two
employers
in
these
situations,
“and
you
had,
necessarily,
always
an
inducement
to
employees
to
strike
or
otherwise
withhold
employment
services.”
and
there
were
two
a
--
two
criticisms,
one
primary
criticism
of
the
limitations
on
this
section,
and
i
want
to
mention
there
were
others
but
only
one
that
need
to
be
mentioned
now.
one
of
the
complaints
was
that
the
requirement
of
inducing
or
encouraging
the
employees
to
engage
in
a
strike
against
the
secondary
employee
meant
that
the
union
could
go
to
the
secondary
employer
and
say
“we
will
call
a
strike
of
your
employees
or
we
will
do
various
other
things
causing
trouble
for
you,”
and
that
wouldn't
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
unfair
labor
practice
wouldn't
come
about
until
there
was
some
inducement
of
the
employee.
that
had
two
consequences
that
the
critics
complained
of.
one
was
that
it
meant,
because
of
the
delays
in
the
administrative
and
judicial
process,
that
the
secondary
employer
would
suffer
some
harm
before
he
ever
could
get
any
relief.
it
also
meant,
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
the
primary
employer,
that
the
secondary
employer,
not
having
much
interest
in
this,
threatened
with
trouble,
the
full
impact
of
which
he
knew
nothing
about,
it
might
be
serious,
it
might
be
trivial.
the
easy
thing
for
him
to
do,
often,
would
be
to
cutoff
dealing
with
the
primary
employer.
and,
both
those
things,
the
critics
from
one
side,
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
said
we're
undesirable.
and,
their
solution
was
to
put
in
the
language
that
now
appears
on
page
2
in
italics,
after
a
little
roman
two,
“so
as
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
labor
organization
for
little
two
to
threatened,
coerce,
or
restrain
any
person,”
and
that
refers
to
the
secondary
employer,
as
a
matter
of
grammar
if
you
read
it
all
the
way
through,
“for
the
purpose
of
making
him
cease
selling
the
goods
of
the
primary
employer.”
the
word
“objection”
is
raised
to
that
also.
that
was
the
proposal
of
the
eisenhower
administration
and
senator
mcclellan
and
others.
one
objection
that
was
raised
recalled
the
experience
of
labor
unions
in
going
to
secondary
employers,
and
it's
saying
to
them,
“look,
this
shop
that
we
have
a
dispute
with
is
run
by
racketeers
or
pays
such
low
wages
that
it's
a
disgrace
to
the
community.
we
want
you
to
stop
dealing
with
it.”
no
threat,
no
coercion,
just
a
plain
request.
one
of
the
big
strikes
in
the
clothing
industry
in
1929
that
senator
kennedy
and
others
recall
during
the
debate
was
settled
when
a
chicago
retailer
went
to
his
supplier
of
clothing
and
said
“if
you
don't
settle
this
strike
with
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
--
settle
this
dispute
with
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
without
a
strike,
i'm
going
to
take
away
$1
million
of
business
annually.”
he
wasn't
yielding
to
a
threat.
he
wasn't
coerced.
he
was
persuaded
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
the
community.
and,
one
of
the
objections
to
the
language
about
threaten,
coerce,
and
restrain
was
that
it
might
stop
that.
the
response
was
that
it
wouldn't,
and
the
critics,
on
that
point,
accepted
the
assurance,
you'll
find
this
on
our
briefs,
that
it
wouldn't
stop
that
kind
of
a
problem,
unaccompanied
by
any
threat
of
economic
pressure
to
a
secondary
employer.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
just
direct
persuasion
of
him,
in
the
sense
of
pointing
out
“it's
good
for
the
community,
it's
good
for
business.
in
the
long
run,
it
may
be
good
for
your
business.
but
know,
if
you
don't,
i'll
do
something.”
mr.
archibald
cox
and
no
--
nothing
of
that
kind
at
all,
no,
nor
on
his
customers.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
the
second
argument
that
developed
around
this
phrase
had
to
do
with
what
we
now
call
consumer
picketing
and
other
efforts
to
induce
consumers
not
to
deal
with
the
secondary
employer.
senator
kennedy
and
congressman
thompson
in
the
house
and
others
who
we're
in
that
group
supporting
moderate
legislation
said
that
they
we're
concerned
that
the
language
“to
threaten,
coerce,
and
restrain
any
person”
would
have
the
effect
of
preventing
a
union
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
this
case
and
the
servette
case
to
follow
focused
upon
the
words
that
appear
in
our
comparative
print
of
the
statute
on
page
2,
just
below
the
middle
of
that
page,
“making
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents
to
threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
for
the
purpose
where
an
objective
is
to
induce
him
to
stop
dealing
with
some
other
person
to
induce
the
--
to
coerce
the
primary
employ
--
the
secondary
employer
for
the
purpose
of
requiring
him
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.”
those
words
were
added
to
the
statute
in
1959,
and
i've
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
adding
them
was
in
order
to
move
the
protection
for
both
the
primary
and
secondary
employer
back
from
where
it
had
been
under
the
original
act
where
there
could
--
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
and
could
be
no
protection
until
there
had
been
inducement
to
the
secondary
employer's
distraint
back
to
the
points
of
threats
before
any
harm
had
actually
eventuated,
but
it
was
made
quite
clear
in
the
course
of
the
debate
that
this
was
not
intended
to
reach
request
to
the
secondary
employer
or
persuasion
of
the
secondary
employer
voluntarily
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.
these
words
were
put
into
the
statute
after
the
bill
had
left
the
senate,
after
the
bill
had
left
the
house
labor
committee,
and
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
when
they
were
put
in
by
the
house,
a
second
controversy
arose,
which
is
also
of
the
essence
and
in
some
respects
closer
to
these
two
cases.
and,
that
had
to
do
with
the
bearing
of
the
words
“on
efforts
to
induce
consumers
not
to
buy
a
product
from
a
secondary
employer,
or
perhaps
not
to
deal
with
the
secondary
employer
at
all,
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
stop
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.”
under
the
taft-hartley
version
of
section
8
(b)(4),
it
was
all
together
clear
that
that
conduct
was
not
unlawful.
to
put
the
illustration
that
was
used
in
a
memorandum
circulated
by
senator
kennedy
and
congressman
thompson,
they
used
the
illustration
of
a
strike
against
the
coors
brewery
up
in
colorado.
and,
they
pointed
out
that
under
the
taft-hartley
version,
while
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
induce
the
employees
of
packing
stores
or
bars
and
taverns
not
to
handle
coors
beer,
or
to
go
on
strike,
or
to
induce
the
truck
drivers
not
to
deliver
it
to
the
taverns
or
packing
stores,
that
it
would
have
been
permissible
under
the
earlier
statute
to
persuade
the
public
not
to
buy
that
product
in
the
packing
stores
or
taverns.
and,
that
this
language
“threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain
any
person”
would
cutoff
what
they
described
is
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
labor
to
seek
public
assistance
in
its
dispute
with
the
primary
employer.
there
was,
as
i
read
the
record,
no
denying
that
the
words
“threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain”
would
reach
that
conduct,
and
this
horns
were
loc
--
they
locked
horns
on
this
question
and
it
became
one
of
the
critical
issues
in
the
country.
one
of
those
problems
that
carried
the
conference
that
you
can
see
from
the
record,
right
down
to
the
last
moment
when
it
almost
split
up
without
any
agreement
between
the
house
and
the
senate.
the
resolution
of
the
conflict
appears
over
on
page
4
of
the
statute,
where
the
conference
committee
resorted
to
one
of
the
many
provisos
that
you
will
find
in
this
act
qualifying
what
precedes,
not
the
best
draftsmanship
in
the
world
but
the
only
way,
apparently,
the
agreement
could
be
reached
at
that
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
4
of
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
very
thin
comparative
print
that
i
have
had
distributed.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
proviso
reads
“provided
that,
for
the
purpose
of
this
paragraph
4
only,
nothing
contained
in
such
paragraph
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
publicity
other
than
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public,
including
consumers
and
members
of
the
labor
organization,
that
a
product
or
products
are
produced
by
an
employer,
with
whom
the
labor
organization
has
a
primary
dispute,
and
are
distributed
by
another
employer.”
so
that,
it
would
seem,
from
the
face
of
the
language
at
least,
that
it
was
quite
plain
that
the
compromise
was
that
the
statute
would
not
interfere
with
the
right
to
engage
in
publicity
other
than
picketing.
but,
the
effort
of
senator
kennedy
and
the
senate
conferees,
to
have
a
broader
proviso
that
would
accept
picketing
at
the
site
of
the
secondary
employer
where
he
sold
the
goods
of
a
manufacturer
with
whom
the
union
had
a
dispute,
was
excluded
from
the
proviso
and
by
implication
and
also,
we
say,
by
the
necessary
words
included
in
the
prohibition
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
explanations
of
the
conference
agreement,
at
least
in
general
terms,
were
that
the
senate
had
been
unsuccessful
in
its
position
with
respect
to
picketing
but
that
it
had
succeeded
in
creating
an
exception
from
the
words
“threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain”
with
respect
to
hand-billing
and
all
other
forms
of
publicity.
against
that
background,
i
come
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
they're
very
simple
and
not
at
all
in
dispute.

was
in
a
labor
dispute
with
tree
fruits,
an
organization
which
represented
and
which
we
may
think
of
as
the
packers
of
washington
state
apples
around
yakima,
washington.
being
unable
to
win
its
--
in
a
--
by
a
strike,
in
an
effort
to
put
more
economic
pressure
on
tree
fruits,
the
producers
or
packers
of
the
apples,
the
teamsters
posted
pickets
at
a
number
of
safeway
stores
in
seattle.
the
picket
signs,
which
appear
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
simply
read
"to
consumers
non-union
washington
state
apples
are
being
sold
at
this
store.
please
do
not
purchase
such
apples,”
and
then,
“teamsters
local
760.”
it
was
charged
that
that
conduct
violated
this
subdivision
we've
been
talking
about,
section
8
(b)(4)(ii)
because
the
picketing
did
threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain
safeway
where
an
object
was
to
--
for
safeway
to
stop
doing
business
with
tree
fruits.
the
board
so
held,
although
there
was
no
proof
as
to
whether
the
picketing
did
any
actual
injury
to
safeway.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
columbia
circuit
set
aside
the
board's
order
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
proof
that
the
picketing
had
done
substantial
injury
to
safeway
or
that
it
was
likely
to
do
sufficient
injury
to
safeway.
and,
we
then
brought
the
case
here,
arguing
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
case
was
incomplete
without
proof
of
--
that
the
da
--
that
the
picketing
would
do
substantial
injury
to
safeway
or
had
done
substantial
injury
to
safeway.
we
submit
the
court
of
appeals
requirement
--
now,
i
come
to
the
somewhat
different
argument
made
by
counsel
a
little
later.
we
submit
the
court
of
appeals
requirement,
that
there
be
affirmative
evidence
that
the
picketing
has
caused
substantial
harm
or
is
about
to
cause
substantial
harm,
is
wrong
for,
i
think,
six
independent
reasons.
first,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
section
8
(b)(4)(ii).
to
picket
a
retail
store
is
certainly
to
threaten
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
store
with
loss
of
patronage
if
he
doesn't
give
in
to
the
union's
wishes.
the
presence
of
the
picket
today
indicates
that
it'll
be
there
tomorrow
unless
you
stop
selling,
in
this
case,
the
washington
state
apples.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that,
it's
removed
by
the
communication
that
the
teamsters
gave
to
the
safeway
stores,
saying
“if
we're
wrong
in
thinking
that
you
are
selling
washington
state
apples,
we'll
take
the
pickets
away.”
it
wasn't
put
in
terms
of
a
threat
but
no
one
could
miss
the
message.
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
just
as
much
of
a
threat.
also,
no
one
could
know
what
the
damage
might
be
as
a
man
pointing
a
gun
at
a
bank
cashier
and
say
“give
me
your
money.”
the
gun
might
not
go
off,
might
not
be
loaded,
might
even
be
an
imitation
gun,
but
those
possibilities
do
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
is
a
threat
and
so,
here,
the
possibility
that
the
picket
line
may
be
wholly
ineffective
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
is
something
calculated
to
cause
economic
loss
and
intended
to
put
economic
pressure.
equally,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
restraint.
it
was
intended
not
to
leave
the
decision
whether
to
sell
the
washington
state
apples
to
safeway
but
to
overbear
safeway's
will
to
prevent
it
from
selling.
and,
surely,
nobody
can
say
that
the
objective
was
not
to
prevent
safeway
from
dealing
with
tree
fruits.
mr.
archibald
cox
why
didn't
they
say
that?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
congress
had
been
concerned
only
with
picketing,
then
that
would
have
been
a
proper
thing
to
do.
that's
what
was
done
in
section
8
(b)(7)
which
was
concerned
only
with
picketing.
there
are
many
other
ways
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suggest
your
honor,
that
when
congress
spoke
in
section
8
(b)(1)
of
inducing
or
encouraging
employees
to
strike,
it
didn't
say
“to
picket
or
otherwise
induce
or
encourage
employees
to
strike.”
it
used
the
general
words
“i
left
all
the
specifications
to
be
included
within
them.”
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
mean,
it
depe
--
i
spoke
a
little
too
broadly.
it
--
where
it
is
not
at
the
--
where
it's
not
where
the
employees
enter,
where
it's
not
--
where
it's
away
from
any
loading
platform
or
anything
like
that,
where
it
is
clearly
only
where
the
employees
wouldn't
have
to
cross
the
picket
line,
no.
but
this,
of
course,
is
--
this
is
the
picket
line
induced
at
--
directed
at
the
patron.
i
think,
through
any
doubt
on
the
--
about
that
matter,
mr.
justice,
the
words
“other
than
picketing”
put
in
the
proviso
would
remove
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could,
but
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
all
the
picketing
is
to
threaten,
coerce,
or
restrain.
why
else
are
the
pickets
there?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
are
lots
of
other
places
of
informing
the
public.
the
only
reason
to
inform
the
public
in
front
of
the
safeway
store
is
so
they
won't
deal
with
safeway,
and
that
surely
is
a
restraint,
an
economic
restraint
of
safeway.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
for
the
purpose
of
putting
economic
pressure
on
that
store
which,
i
submit,
is
a
form
of
coercion
or
restraint.
second,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning,
requiring
proof
of
substantial
economic
harm
or
of
a
likelihood
of
substantial
economic
harm
is
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
this
language.
the
purpose,
as
i
explained
yesterday,
was
to
carry
the
protection
back
farther
to
enable
the
primary
employer
and
the
secondary
employer
when
confronted
with
a
threat,
to
enable
the
secondary
employer
to
get
protection
at
that
stage
instead
of
waiting
until
the
harm
was
done
and
to
relieve
the
primary
employer
from
the
risk
that
the
secondary
employer,
instead
of
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
to
him,
to
relieve
him
from
the
secondary
employer
simply
giving
in
and
to
give
the
primary
employer
protection
against
that.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
becomes
quite
clear
if
you
think
in
terms
not
of
a
consumer
picket
line,
but
of
a
picket
line
directed
at
the
loading
platforms
or
the
employee's
entrance.
if
it
were
shown
that
they
were
picketing
there
or
that
there
were
a
threat
that
the
union
would
picket
there,
and
it
was
charged
that
this
was
coercion
or
--
threatening,
coercion,
or
restraining
the
employer,
no
one
would
suggest
that
it
was
a
defense
to
say,
“well,
we
can't
tell
whether
anybody
will
honor
the
picket
line
or
we
can't
tell
how
much
damage
the
picket
line
will
do,
or
we
can't
tell
whether
the
strike
or
refusal
to
load
or
unload
goods
will
really
hurt
the
secondary
employer's
business.”
and,
by
the
same
token,
that
inquiry
is
not
permissible
here.
third,
i
point
out
this
was
held
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
case
in
conflict
with
this
one,
that
the
--
any
inquiry
into
the
amount
of
harm
done
leads
into
a
morass.
how
much
economic
loss
does
it
take
to
be
coercion?
does
it
have
to
be
1
product,
10
products,
20
products,
1
customer,
10
customers,
20
customers?
it's
a
fruitless
inquiry
and
one
which,
fairness
to
the
union,
does
not
require
because
if
they're
aim
isn't
to
induce
customers
not
to
buy
these
apples,
if
it
really
is
just
to
publicize
their
dispute
with
tree
fruits,
there're
plenty
of
other
places
where
they
can
publicize
it.
the
only
purpose
of
doing
it
here
is
to
have
economic
pressure
against
tree
fruits.
next,
i
point
that
the
interpretation
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
settled
reasoning
under
other
sections
of
the
act.
section
8
(a)(1)
speaks
of
the
interference,
coercion,
or
restraint
of
employees.
it's
always
been
held
that
when
the
employer
engages
in
questioning
employees
about
their
union
membership
or
when
he
conducts
surveillance
of
their
activities,
that
it's
irrelevant
whether
any
employee
actually
felt
coerced.
it's
the
kind
of
conduct
and
the
intent
of
the
conduct
or
tendency
of
the
conduct
that
one
looks
to.
similarly,
in
section
8
(b)(1),
speaking
of
coercion
and
restraint
of
employees,
the
same
rule
had
always
been
followed.
under
8
(b)(4),
in
speaking
of
inducing
or
encouraging
employees
to
engage
in
a
strike,
it
had
always
been
held
and
always
has
been
held
that
it
applies
to
picketing
regardless
of
any
showing
as
to
what
effect
the
picketing
has
actually
had
on
the
employee.
and,
in
speaking
of
forcing
and
requiring
the
secondary
employer
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer,
nobody
has
ever
inquired
whether
it
actually
did
so
force
or
require.
and,
we
think
that
congress,
here,
must
be
taken
in
using
a
very
similar
phrase
to
have
had
a
very
similar
intention.
next,
i
point
out
that
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
is
perfectly
clear.
it
was
stated,
first,
in
objection
to
the
words
“threaten,
coerce,
and
restrain”
before
the
proviso
was
put
in,
that
they
--
that
it
would
cutoff
the
right
to
engage
in
consumer
picketing.
and,
after
the
proviso
was
put
in,
which
as
i
say
was
one
of
the
critical
issue,
it
was
clearly
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
in
the
house
that
the
senate
had
lost
out
in
its
views
about
consumer
picketing.
i
think,
perhaps,
the
clearest
statement
is
the
one
on
page
24
of
my
brief
which
senator
kennedy
made
in
the
house.
“we
were
not
able
to
persuade
the
house
conferees
to
permit
picketing
in
front
of
that
secondary
shop,
but
we
were
able
to
persuade
them
to
agree
that
the
union
shall
be
free
to
conduct
informational
activity
short
of
picketing.”
for
those
reasons,
it
seemed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
there
is
--
the
word
“coercive”
does
appear
in
that
statement.
it's,
as
printed
in
the
afl-cio
brief,
the
word
“coerce”
is
put
in
italic.
one
could
read
the
statement
so
that
he
em
--
so
that
it
emphasize
that,
if
there
was
picketing
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
to
coerce
that
employer
to
deal
with
another
employer
or
not
to
deal
with
another
employer,
one
doesn't
have
to
emphasize
the
word
“coerce,”
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
the
other
history,
that
congressman
griffin
can
hardly
have
intended
to
distinguish
between
coercive
picketing
and
other
picketing
which
has
the
purpose
to
coerce
but
may
not
in
fact
be
very
coercive.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
this
is
nothing
more
than
the
exercise
of
free
speech,
then
the
constitution
protects
it.
i
think
congressman
griffin
was
recognizing
that.
i
think
there's
a
constitutional
problem
here
and
i
would
say
that
it
was
one
that
had
to
be
faced
up
to,
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
so
clear
that
this
is
a
case
where
the,
as
justice
cardozo
said
in
hopkins
savings
association
against
cleary,
that
where
the
intent
is
distinctly
revealed,
the
court
cannot
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
by
disingenuous
reasoning
--
reading
that
the
issue
has
to
be
faced
up
to
an
answer,
and
i
think
this
is
such
a
case.
before
i
come
to
the
constitutional
issue,
there
is
one
more
point
with
which
i
must
deal.
as
i
understand
mr.
previant's
brief,
he
suggest
another
interpretation
than
that
of
the
court
of
appeals,
or
be
it
without
abandoning
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation.
he
says
it
suggest
that
it
all
depends
on
the
wording
of
the
picket
sign.
that
if
the
picket
here
had
said
“please
don't
buy
from
safeway,”
then
he
would
think
that
we
had,
i'm
not
sure
you'd
agree
with
this
but
that
we
have
a
stronger
case.
but
he
says
if
it
says
“please
don't
buy
washington
apples,”
then
that
isn't
within
the
statute.
well,
i
suggest
that
it
is
still
a
threat,
it
is
still
within
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
protection
of
the
secondary
employer
and
the
primary
employer
that
it
still
certainly
can
reasonably
be
found
to
have
the
prohibited
objective,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
pretty
plainly
against
mr.
previant
upon
this
point.
most
of
the
statements,
like
the
one
that
i
read
from
senator
kennedy
before,
speak
in
general
terms
of
picketing
in
front
of
that
secondary
shop
and
i
would
guess
i
would
be
doubtful
whether
anybody
could
fairly
say
that
those
read
on
this
exact
question.
but,
there
are
two,
at
least,
positive
indications
that
the
senators
and
house
were
thinking
in
terms
of
what
might
be
called
product
picketing.
in
the
first
place,
the
example
of
the
coors
brewery
that
i
mentioned
earlier
was
specifically
put
in
terms
of
appeals
to
--
was
specifically
put
in
terms
of
signs
asking
the
public
not
to
buy
the
product
and
senator
morse,
who
is
certainly
one
of
the
leading
experts
on
the
labor
in
the
house,
perhaps
to
more
labor
laws
than
any
other
senator,
specifically
stated
that
one
of
the
reasons
he
had
refused
to
sign
the
conference
report
was
that
it
prevented
employees
from
picketing
at
an
establishment
and
--
at
retail
establishment
and
asking
the
public
not
to
buy
the
product
made
of
a
manufacturer
with
whom
the
union
had
a
dispute.
those
two
instances,
i
think,
are
precise
and
on
the
point.
i
might
also
suggest
that
i
frankly
am
skeptical,
although
my
experience
doesn't
go
far
enough
to
state
definitely,
as
to
whether
the
way
the
s
--
whether
the
wording
of
the
sign
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
what
actually
happens
in
this
respect.
i
would
guess
that,
perhaps,
half
of
the
people,
influenced
by
the
fact
there
was
picketing
at
the
safeway
store,
figured
they
better
go
to
furness
entirely
rather
than
just
not
buy
the
apples,
but
that's
--
i
enter
that
simply
as
a
note
of
skepticism.
for
that
reason,
we
think
there
is
no
greater
merit
to
the
argument
that
is
presented
by
the
respondents
here
and
that
the
statute
will
not
bare
a
discrimination
between
picketing
of
--
in
front
of
the
store
,generally,
and
picketing
of
the
particular
product.
that
brings
me
to
the
final
issue
which,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
to
consider,
and
that
is
whether
this
restriction
is
in
accordance
with
the
first
amendment.
the
argument
is
that
that
this
picketing
in
front
of
the
retail
outlet
is
a
form
of
communication
and
that
congress
does
not
have
power,
under
these
circumstances,
to
restrict
it.
i
would
emphasize,
first,
two
qualities
of
picketing
one
cut
strongly
in
our
favor,
the
other
cut
strongly
in
favor
of
the
respondents.
first,
i
would
emphasize
that
this
is
picketing
in
front
of
a
neutral
employer
who
has
no
interest
in
the
dispute.
it's
100
or
more
miles
away
from
the
dispute
and
there
is
nothing
he
has
done,
except
sell
his
wares
and
continue
to
buy
and
sell
his
wares,
that
in
any
way
that
prejudices
the
union.
that
seems
to
me
to
cut
most
strongly
in
our
favor,
secondary
picketing
has
always
been
treated
as
somewhat
different
from
picketing
at
the
scene
of
the
dispute.
the
second
fact
that
i
think
everybody
should
have
firmly
in
mind
is
that
this
was
picketing
not
to
employees
or
to
truck
drivers
or
to
a
group
--
particularly
to
a
group
of
union
members
in
their
capacity
as
workers
but
was
addressed
to
a
general
public
in
seattle,
to
a
general
public,
a
very
large
percentage
of
whom
are
--
well,
not
a
large
percentage,
a
very
large
number
of
whom
are
members
of
the
teamsters
union.
it's
a
very
strong
teamsters
town.
that
cuts,
i
think,
in
mr.
previant's
way.
now,
we
say,
first,
that
this
issue
is
settled
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
this
court's
decisions.
in
the
vault
case,
the
court
laid
down
the
formula
that
a
legislature,
the
same
rule
which
earlier
applied
to
congress,
has
the
power
to
formulate
a
policy
with
respect
to
this
economic
contest
and
then
to
forbid
picketing,
the
purpose
of
which
is
contrary
to
that
policy.
here,
the
policy
was
to
protect
secondary
employers
against
injury
in
a
dispute
to
which
they
were
not
a
party.
it
was
to
prevent
--
protect
primary
employers
against
what
many
people
felt
was
the
unfair
weapon
of
conscripting
neutrals
who
would
find
it
easier
to
stop
dealing
with
them
and
keep
out
of
labor
trouble
than
it
would
be
to
continue
dealing
with
the
primary
employer.
the
picketing,
also
addressed
to
consumers,
has
an
objective
inconsistent
with
that
policy.
and,
under
the
reasoning
of
the
vault
case
and
the
others
that
follow
it,
this
would,
therefore,
seem
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
archibald
cox
then,
it
would
be
within
the
proviso,
and
no
constitutional
question
would
have
to
be
faced.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i
would
separate,
mr.
justice,
patrolling
in
a
particular
site
from
patrolling
in
the
streets
generally.
the
court
has
frequently
noted,
all
the
justices
i
think,
that
picketing
of
a
particular
locality
has
a
capacity
for
inducing
action
quite
distinct
from
the
mere
force
of
the
words
expressed.
i
take
it
that
what
people
have
in
mind
is
that
there
are
many
reasons
men
and
women
don't
cross
picket
line,
maybe
embarrassment,
maybe
fear
of
being
jostled,
maybe
group
loyalties,
maybe
simply
“well,
there's
trouble
there
and
i
like
to
keep
out
of
trouble
and
not
make
myself
conspicuous,”
maybe
fear
of
union
reprisals.
all
those
things
tend
to
go
far
more
closely
with
picketing
than
they
do
with
publicity
in
a
newspaper
--
mr.
archibald
cox
or
even
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
by
picketing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
marching
and
patrolling
with
a
placard.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
also
mean
at
a
particular
place,
mr.
justice,
at
the
place
where
you
are
trying
to
induce
some
kind
of
economic
action.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
well,
i
think,
here,
what
the
congress
did,
and
i
would
emphasize
this
very
strongly,
that
what
the
congress
has
tried
to
do
here,
maybe
wisely,
maybe
not,
i
thought
unwisely,
i
thought
“other
than
picketing”
shouldn't
be
in
this
statute.
that
it
ought
to
be
broader
but
it's
been
put.
i
think
what
congress
tried
to
do
was
to
separate
out
as
far
as
it
is
humanly
possible
the
elements
of
communication.
you
can
pass
out
handbills,
you
can
have
sound
trucks,
you
can
put
advertisements
in
the
papers,
you
can
talk
over
the
radio
from
the
patrolling
with
a
picket
sign
in
front
of
a
particular
locality.
but
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
presume
so,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
just
described
as
picketing
here,
so
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
assuming
it
was
in
--
assuming
it
was
in
accordance
with
a
local
ordinance
that
was
known
to
us,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
then,
it
would
not
offend
the
statute.
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
line
which
i
think
the
word
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
there
was,
as
justice
goldberg
points
out,
there
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
discussion
of
first
amendment
problem.
there
was
--
i've
tried
to
keep
myself
as
remote
from
this
as
i
can,
but
there
was
a
lot
of
thought.
if
you'll
read
the
statute
carefully,
there
was
a
lot
of
thought
into
the
differences
between
various
forms
of
communication
and
various
forms
of
picketing.
if
you
read
8
(b)(7),
you'll
see
there
was
an
effort
to
draw
some
lines
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
the
picketing.
and,
here,
--
now,
i've
interjected
myself,
i
may
--
i
remember
very
vividly
in
the
old
supreme
court
chamber
arguing
with
one
of
the
house
conferees
on
the
republican
side
in
favor
of
a
broader
proviso,
and
we
hope
to
persuade
him.
he
said
“i
will
never
agree
to
the
picketing,”
and
i
argue
“this
is
nonsense”
on
what,
as
justice
stewart
was
saying
the
other
day,
and
he
said
“well,
i
just
--
i
think
they're
different,
and
i
think
the
statute
shows
that
the
congress
thought
they
were
different
because
it
put
in
other
than
picketing.”
and,
i
submit
that,
although
there
are
the
differences
between
kinds
of
picketing,
as
mr.
previant
will
point
out,
quoting
from
an
article
of
mine,
that
even
this
kind
of
picketing
does
have
differences
from
other
forms
of
communication
and
that
where
it
is
at
a
secondary
site,
and
counsel
neglected
to
point
out
that
my
article
has
some
exceptions
for
secondary
sites,
it
raises
some
doubts
about
what
i
say
is
applied
to
secondary
sites.
that,
as
applied
to
a
secondary
site,
that
that
is
not
an
unreasonable
or
improper
line
for
congress
to
draw
trying
to
exclude
from
the
picketing
--
tried
to
forbid
the
picketing
and
allow
all
other
kinds
of
communication.
maybe
it
was
unwise.
we
may
think
it
was
but,
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
the
duplex-deering
case
in
his
dissent,
it's
for
the
legislature
to
decide
what
limits
to
set
on
individual
and
group
rights
of
aggression
or
defense.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
federal
statute
would
be
conclusive.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they
said
the
city
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
city
has
no
right
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
federal
statute
would
occupy
the
field.
the
federal
statute
would
prohibit
this
kind
of
conduct
and
the
city
couldn't
license
it
under
those
circumstances.
this
would
be
the
same
thing
as
the
city
saying
“we
authorize
employers
to
walk
up
and
down
in
front
of
union
halls.”
mr.
archibald
cox
which,
would
be
an
employer
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
then,
there
would
be
--
if
the
statute
--
federal
statute
said
no
publicity
in
the
papers,
i
don't
think
a
city
law
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
but
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
forbid
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
city
or
state
passing
forbidding
the
marching
around?
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
understand
your
honor,
and
i
must
have
misund
--
misheard
you
before
because
my
--
at
first,
i
thought
you
spoke
of
the
ordinance
permitting
the
marching
round
and
round
and
my
answer,
of
course,
makes
no
point
at
all
if
you
said
“forbidding
the
marching
round
and
round.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let's
suppose
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
let's
suppo
--
here,
i
would
say,
that
all
this
statute
does
is
forbid
the
marching
round
and
round.
it
carefully
permits
everything
else
in
the
way
of
communication
anywhere,
at
this
site
or
anywhere
else,
because
the
proviso
specifically
reserves
the
right
--
i
don't
know
that
it
needed
to
do
it,
the
constitution
might
have
done
it,
but
the
proviso
carefully
reserves
the
right
to
engage
in
publicity
other
than
picketing.
in
other
words,
patrolling,
marching
round
and
round,
or
marching
back
and
forth,
permits
everything
else
in
the
way
of
communication.
and,
the
gist
of
my
case
on
the
constitutional
point
is
that
this
is
about
as
close
i
think
as
it
is
humanly
possible
to
come
between
permitting
everything
in
the
way
of
expression
but
eliminating
this
peculiar
kind
of
conduct
that
generates
responses,
quite
apart
from
anything
that
has
been
said.
and,
it
being
at
a
secondary
site,
we
think
that
is
a
final
argument
in
support
of
the
conclusion.
but
i
think
i've
spoken
to
your
point.
i'm
afraid
i'm,
frankly,
stupid
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
well,
i
think
our
opposition
is
entirely
consistent
with
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
that
standing
with
a
placard
probably
came
under
the
heading
of
picketing.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
did.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
thinking
of
mobile
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mobile
pickets.
the
line
--
i
must
confess
that
the
line
between,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
yesterday,
the
line
between
picketing
and
publicizing
gets
very
thin
and
one
can't
put
cases
which
it's
very
hard
to
draw
and
this
may
throw
doubt
on
the
wisdom
of
drawing
it,
but
it
was
drawn.
and,
in
this
case,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
these
two
cases
were
spared
the
necessity
for
going
into
that
because
the
stipulation
of
facts
in
this
case
is
in
terms
of
picketing.
and,
as
i
understand
the
facts
of
the
servette
case
to
follow,
it's
agreed
that
that
was
handbilling
and
there
is
no
argument
that
it
was
picketing.
so,
i
think,
your
honor's
case
is
one
that
the
board
would
have
to
rule
out
in
the
future.
i've
given
the
best
answer
i
can.
i
think
if
he
has
a
picket
sign,
even
if
he
stands
pretty
still,
he's
probably
picketing
but
that's
just
a
quick
call
for
tough
judgment.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
thing,
mr.
justice
that
--
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
one
thing
i
would
suggest
is
that
it
certainly
was
utterly
irrelevant
whether
there
was
any
physical
coercion
of
the
customers.
why
the
court
of
appeals
directed
attention
to
that
question,
i
find
very
hard
to
understand.
second,
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
which,
in
all
its
sections,
as
your
honor
knows
better
than
i
do,
deals
with
economic
coercion
and
pressure,
far
more
than
with
physical
coercion
and
pressure.
and,
nice
old
ladies
sometimes
can
exercise
a
great
deal
of
economic
pressure.
