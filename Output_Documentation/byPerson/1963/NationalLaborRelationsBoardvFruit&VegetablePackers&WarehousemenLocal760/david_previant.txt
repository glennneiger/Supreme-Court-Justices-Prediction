mr.
david
previant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
this
last
colloquy
does
emphasize
something
that
confronts
the
court
in
all
of
these
cases
because
whether
there's
a
stipulation
that
there's
picketing
or
not,
there
are
different
kinds
of
picketing
and
different
ways
of
picketing.
our
client
suggested
last
night
after
hearing
justice
stewart's
question
that
if
he
had
mo
--
marched
in
front
of
this
store
merely
with
handbills
but
held
the
handbill
in
front
of
him
and
then,
as
the
people
went
by,
handed
them
a
handbill
as
much
as
you
see
newspaper
purveyors
on
the
street
corners
or
they
had
their
newspaper
up
in
front
of
them
with
the
big
headline
there
that
he
said
“well,
what
i
--
what
would
i
be
doing
then?
would
i
be
picketing
or
handbilling?”
i
think
it's
a
good
question.
i
don't
know
that
it
has
to
be
met
in
this
case,
however.
i
do
think
that
the
nature
of
the
problem
in
the
case
requires,
however,
a
little
more
of
attention
to
the
facts
than
the
general
gave
us
this
morning
because
if
there
is
a
difference
in
types
of
picketing
or
in
picketing
as
such,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
in
each
case
there
is
a
burden
on
the
board
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
particular
means
which
a
union
employs
in
order
to
bring
its
particular
cause
to
triumph
is
important.
and,
that
you
cannot
do,
as
the
board
did
here
and
as
believe
the
solicitor
general
asked
this
court
to
do,
assume
from
the
mere
fact
of
picketing
a
per
se
threat
or
coercion
which
the
congress
intended
to
ban
by
this
statute
without
saying
so
specifically.
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that,
after
the
strike
which
involves
some-1,500
employees
and
which
unfortunately
was
a
short
duration
because
of
the
willingness
of
these
strike-breakers
and
others
to
return
to
work,
the
union
thought
that
the
economic
pressure
which
it
could
assert
against
tree
fruits
could
best
be
accomplished
by
asking
the
consumers
not
to
buy
the
apples
which
tree
fruits
packed,
warehoused,
and
shipped.
and,
in
accordance
with
that
determination,
they
then
went
to
the
large
chain
of
supermarkets
in
that
area.
they
advised
the
managers
of
those
stores
what
their
problem
was.
they
gave
them
a
letter.
they
told
them
the
history
of
their
dispute.
they
told
them
how
they'd
been
willing
to
submit
to
mediation
or
arbitration
and
how
the
employer
turned
it
down
and
that,
finally,
this
strike
occurred.
that
in
spite
of
the
strike,
the
21
employers
who
are
part
of
the
tree
fruits
association
were,
nevertheless,
engaged
in
what
was
almost
normal
operation
that
is
packing,
warehousing,
shipping,
the
washington
state
apples.
they
advised
this
manager
that
they
were
going
to
ask
the
public
not
to
buy
the
apples.
they
told
him
that
they
had
given
specific
instructions
to
the
pickets
in
that
regard
and
they
handed
him
the
instructions
to
the
pickets.
they
were
instructed
to
patrol
peacefully
at
the
consumer
entrance
of
the
stores.
they
were
to
stay
away
from
the
delivery
entrances.
they
were
not
to
interfere
with
any
of
the
employees
in
the
stores,
the
clerks
or
others,
nor
were
they
to
interfere
with
any
drivers
or
any
other
persons
who
entered
upon
the
store
premises,
either
for
the
purpose
of
making
pickups
or
for
the
purpose
of
making
deliveries.
and,
they
were
going
to
circulate
a
handbill
which
they,
in
turn,
gave
a
copy
to
the
manager.
they
even
suggested
to
the
manager
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
about
their
intention
that
all
of
this
be
posted
on
the
bulletin
board
so
that
the
employees
in
that
store
know
that
there
was
no
pressure
intended
or
asserted
against
safeway
or
its
employees
or
even
at
its
customers.
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
to
the
picture.
these
two
middle-aged,
probably
middle-classed,
ladies
carrying
their
little
aprons,
walking
in
front
of
that
store,
merely
saying
“non-union
washington
state
apples
are
being
sold
at
this
store.
please
do
not
purchase
such
apples.”
and,
the
picture
will
show
that
the
“please
do
not
purchase
such
apples”
is
not
a
footnote
but
is
as
large
almost
as
the
word
"non-union
washington
state
apples."
the
handbills
did
the
same
thing,
and
they
emphasized
that
this
is
not
a
strike
against
any
store
or
market.
this
picketing
started
after
the
store
opened
for
business
so
there'll
be
no
interference
with
deliveries
or
with
employees
and
it
was
concluded
before
the
store
closed
its
business
that
day.
there
were
generally
only
two
pickets.
on
one
occasion,
there
were
three.
there's
no
dispute
that
this
was
entirely
peaceful.
there
was
no
blocking
in
any
egrets
or
anywhere
as
to
the
store.
the
handbills
were
passed
out
to
only
those
who
would
accept
them.
they
did
not
confront
customers
or
forced
these
handbills
on
the
customers.
the
store
employees
worked
as
usual,
the
deliveries
and
pickups
continued
as
usual
and,
even
in
those
instances
where
the
store
was
at
the
rear
of
a
parking
lot,
they
had
to
picket
out
in
front
of
the
parking
lot
where
they
couldn't
distribute
the
handbills
which
is
one
example
of
why
distributing
handbills
is
not
always
as
effective
as
picketing
because,
here,
the
people
are
driving
into
the
parking
lot
and
they
could
not
even
--
if
there
were
a
distribution
of
handbills,
they
could
not
have
been
given
those
handbills.
these,
then,
are
the
facts
which
the
board
would
have
a
say,
leads
to
the
per
se
conclusion,
a
priori
assumption
that
this
is
picketing
which
threatens,
coerces,
and
restrains.
that
this
is
picketing
which
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
was
talking
about
secondary
boycotts.
now,
the
court
below,
we
believe,
did
what
was
proper
under
the
statute.
it
said
that
the
only
plausible
reading
of
the
statute
was
that
the
determination
to
be
made
by
the
board
was
whether
or
not
picketing
in
fact
threatens,
coerces,
or
restrains.
that
you
cannot
assume
from
the
mere
act
of
picketing,
it
constitutes
a
threat
any
more
than
a
newspaper
ad.
that
it
constitutes
coercion
any
more
than
any
other
form
of
persuasion
or
that
it
constitutes
a
restraint.
and,
the
court
did
not
say
that
because
there
was
no
damage,
there
was
no
threat,
coercion,
or
restraint.
the
court
mentioned
that
part
of
the
case
in
two
respects.
it
said,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
threat,
coercion,
or
restraint,
we
consider
the
impact
of
this
conduct
along
with
all
other
elements
in
the
case,
which
is
what
the
board
should
have
done
according
to
the
court.
we
considered
with
--
along
the
fact
that
there
was
no
work
stoppage.
there
was
no
delivery
stoppage.
there
was
no
confrontation
of
customers.
there
was
no
embargo
of
that
store
and
no
evidence
indicating
in
anyway
that
this
picket,
only
asking
the
consumer
not
to
buy
washington
state
apples,
turned
away
any
other
customer
as
a
result
of
that
sign
who
intended
to
enter
that
store
for
any
other
purpose.
that,
in
it
of
itself,
would
not
be
conclusive
but
the
court
enumerated
all
of
these
things,
including
the
element
of
damage
and
said
“as
we
look
at
this
total
picture,
we
can
find
no
basis
for
a
conclusion
that
this
picketing
constituted
a
threat
or
that
it
was
coercion
or
that
it
restrained
as
contemplated
by
the
statute.”
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
rejection
of
the
board's
conclusion
because
the
board
could
not
find
that
fact.
it
was,
in
that
sense,
a
finding
of
fact,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
they
said
this
--
the
burden
is
on
the
board
to
show
injury.
they
said
the
burden
is
on
the
board
to
show
threats,
coercion,
or
restraint
and
that,
in
such
showing,
the
board
may
consider
all
of
these
other
elements
and,
on
this
stipulation,
the
board
just
could
not
make
such
a
finding,
that's
right.
that
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
bare
language
of
the
statute
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
that
is
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
well,
that
is
--
yes,
that
is
what
the
court
said.
the
court
said
that
you
cannot
assume
from
the
mere
fact
of
picketing
that
there
was
either
a
threat
or
coercion.
mr.
david
previant
the
burden
is
on
the
board
to
make
such
finding
and
that's
why
that
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
board.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
that's
right.and,
on
that,
you're
basing
your
argument
on
the
universal
camera
case?
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
would
be
the
universal
camera
case.
i'm
sure
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
“the
board,
in
order
to
come
in
and
predicate
an
order
on
threats,
coercion,
or
restraint,
cannot
rely
upon
a
per
se
rule,”
which
is
obviously
what
the
board
did.
the
board
did
not
make
any
canvass
of
the
facts
and
conclude
from
the
facts
that
this
was
either
a
threat,
coercion,
or
restraint.
the
board
merely
said
that
it
was
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
it
was
clear
reasoning
backward
from
the
proviso
that
the
congress
intended
that
picketing
per
se,
as
such,
without
any
further
showing,
came
within
the
statutory
prohibition,
the
operative
part
of
the
statute,
threats
--
mr.
david
previant
coercion.
mr.
david
previant
--
and
restraint.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
the
word
“threat,”
as
used
in
this
statute,
was
a
threat
to
do
that
which
constitutes
coercion
or
restraint
because
if
we
skip
over
to
the
legislative
history,
we
find
that
what
the
congress,
at
least
those
who
were
talking
about
this
when
they
were
taking
about
patching
up
the
so
called
loophole,
they
were
talking
about
a
threat
to
a
so-called
neutral
employer,
the
secondary
employer
that,
unless
he
stop
doing
business
with
the
employer
with
whom
the
union
had
a
primary
dispute,
they
would
visit
trouble
upon
this
neutral.
that
was
the
threat,
“you
stop
doing
business
then
we'll
strike
you.
you
stop
doing
business
--
that
is,
unless
you
stop
doing
business,
we'll
strike
you.
if
you
don't
stop
doing
business,
you
will
have
labor
trouble.
you've
got
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
us
in
the
future.
if
you
don't
stop
doing
business,
we
will
picket
your
plant.
we
will
embargo
your
plant
if
you
don't
stop
doing
business
with
them.”
this
is
the
kind
of
a
threat,
and
the
word
“threat,”
in
that
context,
recurs
continually
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act.
mr.
david
previant
it
is
not
a
threat
in
this
context
because
all
you're
saying
to
that
employer
is
“you
continue
to
do
your
business.
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
see
if
we
can
--
mr.
david
previant
no,
positively
not.
that
customer
will
go
in
there
for
any
other
purpose
and
do
as
much
business
as
he
wants
with
that
employer.
we
will
make
an
effort
to
persuade
that
customer
not
to
buy
a
specific
product.
now,
his
business
in
that
product
depends
upon
customer
demand.
if
an
informed
customer
won't
buy
that
product
because
of
a
labor
dispute,
just
as
an
informed
customer
may
not
buy
a
product
because
of
a
report
of
a
consumer's
union
--
mr.
david
previant
this
is
no
damage
to
him.
mr.
david
previant
there
is
no
threat,
restraint,
or
coercion
--
mr.
david
previant
there
would
not
be
in
our
opinion.
mr.
david
previant
we
don't
think
that
that's
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
now,
insofar
--
mr.
david
previant
in
the
context
of
this
case,
there
just
could
not
be
a
violation.
and,
there
is
the
--
what
can
happen
in
other
cases
requires,
as
the
court
below
said,
a
canvass
by
the
board
of
the
particular
fact.
you
just
can't
take
the
words
“threat,
restraint,
and
coercion”
and
plaster
them
up
against
the
word
“picket”
and
say
they're
the
same
thing.
you'll
go
out
and
find
out
first
whether
or
not
picketing
is
actually
in
the
particular
circumstance.
mr.
david
previant
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
perfectly
consistent
in
this
very
case.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
david
previant
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying,
and
i
didn't
intend
to
say,
that
you
must
show
an
actually
effect.
i
think
you've
got
to
show
the
conduct
itself.
this
court
said
in
radio
officers
that
the
conduct
itself
carried
with
it
the
discrimination
and,
therefore,
the
intent.
but
you
said
also
in
the
357
case,
in
the
hiring
hall
case,
that
you
just
can't
assume
because
a
particular
act
will
cause
conduct
on
the
part
of
others
that
this
was
the
intention
and,
therefore
you
can
engraft
on
the
statute
the
limitations
which
the
board
engraft
upon
it.
there
--
when
we
get
to
a
--
to
the
argument
on
the
constitutional
question,
now,
we
point
out,
we
think
very
clearly,
that
while
there
were
many
cases
in
this
court
that
said
picketing
is
information
plus
and
that
this
maybe
taken
into
consideration
in
a
particular
circumstance,
the
court,
always
being
very
careful
to
point
out,
that
in
each
case,
it
would
look
at
both
the
conduct
which
was
complained
of
and
the
object
toward
which
that
conduct
was
directed.
in
this
case,
we
say
you
can
look
at
the
conduct
and
you
will
find
none
of
the
plus
values
or
detriment
which
the
court
has
found
in
other
picketing
cases.
the
concert
of
action
which
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
in
giboney,
you
don't
find
those
in
this
case.
there
is
no
showing
here
of
any
kind
other
than
communication
in
its
purest
form,
in
its
purest
form.
we
believe
that,
on
a
canvass
of
the
many
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
this
is
the
first
case
which
presents
to
this
court
this
element
of
picketing
in
its
purest
form
without
any
suggestion
of
any
other
kinds
of
things
entering
into
it
which
make
it
picketing
plus.
and,
we
say,
on
that
basis,
the
court
below
was
perfectly
right
in
preventing
to
the
board,
and
the
board
knew
--
the
board
knew
on
remand
that
it
had
all
of
the
facts
which
its
local
counsel
stipulated
to.
that
there
was
no
point
to
taking
this
case
back
to
seattle
because
the
board
had
before
it
each
and
every
fact
which
had
any
bearing
upon
the
problem
presented
by
the
statute.
and,
it
is
just
on
those
bare-bones
that
the
board
said,
and
i
think
driven
by
the
proviso
because
that
proviso
says
“except
picketing,”
they
say
if
the
proviso
says
except
picketing,
then
they
must
amend
picketing.
driven
by
a
legislative
history
and
--
mr.
david
previant
if
the
proviso
accepted
picketing,
they
merely
assumed
that
the
operative
part
of
the
statute
included
picketing
as
such.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
reasoning.
mr.
david
previant
well
i
--
i
don't
know
that
his
argument
is
quite
as
bold
as
the
board's
argument
on
that
particular
point.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
--
speaks
more
in
terms
of
threat.
i
think
in
that
p
--
in
that
way,
the
attorneys
have
departed
somewhat
from
the
board's
position
because
the
board
looked
at
the
statute
with
the
clause
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
proviso
and
found
that
it
included
picketing
without
making
any
independent
determinations
as
to
whether
the
picketing,
in
this
particular
case,
constituted
a
threat
or
constituted
coercion
or
restraint
as
the
statute
requires
it
to
do.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
no
such
request.
there
has
been
argued
that
because
there
was,
contained
in
the
letter,
a
statement,
“if
we
are
mistaken,
if
you
do
not
have
washington
apples
proviso,
then
we
will
remove
the
picket.”
some
would
argue
that
this
is
a
request.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
would
make
any
difference
if
it
were
a
request
because
i
still
think
the
point
is
that
this
kind
of
pure
communication
at
the
place
where
it
is
the
most
effective.
the
point
of
consumption
place,
i
think
that's
the
one
that
the
point
of
purchase
place
is
what
the
advertising
then
used.
this
effective
communication
cannot
be
restrained
surely
because
you
could
do
it
on
the
radio.
that
has
never
been
the
test.
it's
never
been
the
test
that
you
could
restrain
it
in
front
of
the
store.
you
could
restrain
it
here
because
you
could
do
it
some
place
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
raised
by
that
kind
of
an
approach
are
much
more
serious
and
just
appear
on
the
surface
here.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
this
is
the
only
notice
that
was
sent
out
and
i
think
that
would
conclude
--
mr.
david
previant
plus
--
plus
the
instructions,
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
and,
that's
all
there
is
in
this
case
on
the
legislative
history
and
we
say
that
this
legislative
history
is
not
as
clear
as
the
solicitor
general
would
say
it
is,
that
the
great
deal
of
regard
for
his
expertise
in
many
fields,
seems
to
me
though,
that
when
the
march
through
the
jungles
of
legislative
history
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
none
of
us
are
experts
and
you
can
really
read
that
legislative
history
for
whatever
you
want
to
read
into
it.
i
think
it
is
true
that
the
legislature
did
embark
the
problem
of
the
task,
opposing
up
what
some
people
thought
was
a
loophole
in
the
old
act
and
what
some
people
thought
was
deliberately
left
the
way
it
was.
and,
the
legislative
debates
do
emphasize
the
coercion
of
the
so-called
neutral.
it's
also
true
that,
when
the
original
bill
came
out
of
the
house
committee
and
the
original
bill
came
out
of
the
senate
committee,
this
language
was
not
in.
the
speech
made
by
the
president
eisenhower
alerted
a
lot
of
people
to
what
they
thought
were
some
inadequacies
in
the
bill.
so,
the
--
there
is
no
committee
hearing
to
which
we
can
look
for
history
here.
there's
really
no
committee
report
except
a
very
bare
house
report,
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
the
conference
report.
the
conference
report
--
well,
there
is
none.
so,
what
we
have
is
some
statements
which
were
made
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
the
administration
bill
was
amended
by
the
landrum-griffin
bill,
shortly
before
it
was
adopted
by
the
house.
so,
explanations
made
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
what
transpired
with
respect
to
the
conferences
and
then
a
lot
of
post-legislative
history,
everybody
saying
what
they
thought
they
had
done
after
it
was
done
without
any
remarkable
agreement
on
that
particular
point.
but
the
language
that
is
used,
we
submit,
is
language
that
was
directed
to,
as
i've
said
before,
the
threat
to
the
neutral
employer.
in
this
case,
let's
say
it
would
have
been
a
threat
to
safeway.
“if
you
continue
to
purchase,
market,
display,
and
sell
washington
state
apples,
we
will
shut
your
store
down.
we
will
urge
all
of
our
friends
to
never
enter
the
premises.
we
will
ask
those
drivers
who
are
members
of
our
union
not
to
make
deliveries
or
pickups.
and,
we
will
try
to
persuade
your
inside
employees
to
walk
out”.
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
is
repeated
time
and
time
again
in
the
debate.
they
talked
about
the
so-called
consumer
boycott
or
the
secondary
consumer
boycott.
they
were
talking
about
a
thrust
against
the
entire
enterprise
as
such
and
not
the
request
to
a
particular
consuming
public
not
to
purchase
a
particular
product.
the
statements
of
mr.
griffin
have
already
been
referred
to.
the
statement
of
then-senator
kennedy,
i
think,
has
to
be
read
in
context.
at
that
point,
senator
kennedy,
when
he
was
confronted
with
this
new
language
and
which
did
not
appear
in
the
senate
bill,
said
that
he
was
embarking
to
save
the
right
of
people
not
to
patronize
the
one
who
sells
non-union
goods.
he
was
not
embarking
on
a
task
to
save
the
right
of
the
person
not
to
buy
the
particular
non-union
goods.
he
was
talking
about
an
embargo
of
the
total
establishment
and
he
went
out
to
save
the
right
to
such
embargo.
they
had
examples
of
all
he
wanted
to
with
the
racketeer
shop
and
the
sweatshop.
he
wanted
to
have
the
total
embargo
saved
and,
when
he
came
back,
he
acknowledged
defeat.
he
said
“i
could
not
save
the
total
embargo.”
mr.
david
previant
well,
he
said
“i
was
defeated.
i
could
not
save
the
total
embargo
with
the
picket.
i
can
save
it
with
a
handbill.”
now,
this
is,
in
essence,
what
senator
kennedy
was
saying
“those
who
are
parading
a
horrible,
both
before
and
afterwards,
with
force,
i
don't
think,
as
opponents
to
the
particular
piece
of
legislation,
are
entitled
any
great
weight
at
this
point.”
another
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think,
on
the
definition
given
here
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
board
adopted,
it
would
be
that
they
were
--
they
were
there.
they
were
placarded.
they
were
either
in
a
mobile
or
--
mr.
david
previant
there
would
not
be
--
there
would
not
be.
i
think,
again,
the
example
given
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
illustrates
the
problems
here
and
i
think
the
whole
problem
grows
out
of
--
and
this
would,
i
suppose
--
well,
i
will
mention
it
when
we
get
to
this
--
to
the
constitutional
problem.
i
would
like
to
point
out
only
one
more
thing
on
the
legislative
history.
in
a
footnote
which
appears
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
we
refer
to
the
fact
that
senator
goldwater,
while
the
bill
was
before
the
conference
committee,
made
an
effort
to
explain
the
bill
as
he
understood
it
to
his
fellow
senators
and
so,
he
compiled
a
list
of
definition.
he
said
that,
first
of
all,
he
defined
a
secondary
boycott
as
involving
the
application
of
pressure,
usually
economic
pressure,
on
one
company
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
it
to
stop
doing
business
with
another.he
says
there
are
two
kinds.
the
secondary
employees
boycott
the
secondary
consumer.
a
secondary
consumer
or
customer
boycott
involves
the
refusal
of
consumers
or
costumers
to
buy
the
products
or
services
of
the
one
employer
in
order
to
force
him
to
stop
doing
business
with
another.
not
true
here.
not
true
in
the
typical
product
picketing,
product
boycott,
or
what
we
say
is
really
a
primary
boycott
where
the
request
is
not
to
bare
down
heavily
on
the
person
who
is
dealing
in
the
product.
the
request
is
“don't
buy
or
use
the
product
while
we
have
a
problem
with
that
em
--
with
the
producer
of
that
product.”
mr.
david
previant
we
think
--
we
think
it
is
extremely
significant.
mr.
david
previant
they
did
not
do
it,
and
they
used
picketing
and
they
used
it
in
8
(b)(7).
and,
this
is
colloquy
of
congressman
griffin,
again,
continually
emphasizes,
both
as
it
appears
in
the
solicitor's
brief
and
in
an
amicus
brief,
our
brief,
that
we
are
talking
about
coercion.
coerce
or
restrain
the
employer
of
that
second
establishment
to
get
him
not
to
do
business
all
the
way
through.
he
says
if
the
purpose
is
to
coerce,
yes,
and
then,
of
course,
he
says
that
subject
to
the
right
of
free
speech.
incidentally,
getting
back,
i
re
--
now
to
this
question
of
a
threat,
i
note
that
the
board
does
not,
even
as
late
as
november
21,
1963,
predicate
its
decisions
in
this
area
on
the
word
“threat”
in
the
statute.
in
the
case
of
dairylea
dairy
distributors,
145
nlrb
no.
14,
54
lrrm
1326,
the
board
says
“with
respect
to
respondent's
reliance
upon
the
court's
decision
in
fruit
and
vegetable
packers
and
warehousemen,
local
760,
the
petition
for
certiorari
granted,
we
note
that
the
board
is
respectfully
adhering
to
its
position
that
consumer
picketing
of
a
secondary
establishment
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion,
not
threat.”
i
think
the
board
accepts
the
fact
that
it
is
a
different
kind
of
threat,
not
the
dictionary
term
that
was
used
in
this
statute.
and,
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
as
do
the
briefs
of
amicus
in
this
case,
that
this
court,
in
another
case
involving
similar
language
but
used
another
section
of
the
statute,
the
statute
says
you
shall
not
coerce
or
restrain
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
right.
this
court
said
that
this
is
to
be
used
only
in
a
particular
context.
it's
a
restrictive
phrase.
it
is
to
be
equated
with
threat
of
reprisal
or
force
or
promise
of
benefit.
now,
admittedly,
what
may
not
be
coercive
as
to
an
employee
maybe
coercive
as
to
an
employer,
but
we
submit
that
when
the
legislature
uses
--
the
congress
uses
precisely
the
same
language
which
appeared
in
another
part
of
the
act,
and
which
now
has
on
it
the
gloss
of
the
interpretation
of
this
court
in
the
local
639
case,
that
they
must
be
deemed
to
have
adopted
that
interpretation
and
that,
there
and
here
as
in
there,
court
said
there
in
the
639
case,
curtis
furniture,
that
coerce
and
restrain
means
violence.
it
means
the
usual
overbearing
kind
of
conduct,
not
whatever
to
arrest
some
person
may
find
in
his
mind
because
of
picketing.
the
court
refused
to
use
that.
the
court
refused
to
say
that
there
was
a
subjective
test
when
that
precise
phrase
was
used
in
a
--
in
the
preceding
section
of
the
statute.
we
say
that
we
want
to
assume
that
the
congress
did.
now,
why
do
we
quarrel
with
the
interpretation
here?
we
think
we
have
a
strong
constitutional
argument.
we
may
have
a
very
strong
constitutional
argument.
but
we
say
that
we
have
an
obligation
and
we
believe
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
look
at
a
statute
and,
if
upon
reading
that
statute,
it
appears
that
any
one
of
two
constructions
of
that
statute
are
perfectly
reasonable,
then
it
should
adopt
that
construction
which
avoids
the
constitutional
issue.
solicitor
general
feels
that
this
rule
does
not
apply
because
he
says
it's
so
clear
here
what
the
congress
intended
that
this
court
would,
although
he
doesn't
say
so
but
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
argument
is
such,
would
in
fact
be
legislating
if,
they
said
the
congress
didn't
do
so,
merely
to
avoid
the
constitutional
argument.
but,
we
invite
the
examination
of
the
statutory
language
of
the
legislative
materials
of
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
and
we
say
that
a
perfectly
rational
interpretation
of
the
statute,
a
perfectly
plausible
interpretation,
more
than
plausible
is
a
bad
word,
a
real
sound
interpretation
of
this
statute
will
avoid
the
constitutional
question
by
the
s
--
just
the
holding,
as
the
court
below
did.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
well
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
we
would
like
to
have
it
decided
as
a
picketing
case,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
handbilling
--
there's
a
handbilling
case
coming
before
this
court
following
this
argument
in
which,
at
least,
amicus
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
handbilling
can
be
coercive.
the
board
did
not
raise
that
question.
the
board
assumed
there
that
handbilling
was
coercive
--
mr.
david
previant
but
it
goes
down
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
perhaps
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
we
want
a
finding
that,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
threat,
there
was
no
restraint,
and
there
was
no
coercion.
we
would
like
a
finding
that
in
any
case
where
the
board
is
confronted
with
the
question
as
to
whether
picketing
or
handbilling
or
any
other
means
of
communication
constitute
threats,
coercion,
or
restraint,
the
board
must
make
an
independent
investigation
of
all
of
the
facts
and
make
a
finding
of
fact
based
on
that
record
that
there
was
such
and
not
draw
the
inference
from
the
mere
conduct
itself.
mr.
david
previant
we
would
not.
mr.
david
previant
we
would
not.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
and,
we
have
stipulated
here
that
this
is
picketing.
mr.
david
previant
we
have
so
stipulated.
and,
we
think
that
the
record
is
such
that
that
problem
must
be
met
head
on
and
we're
perfectly
ready
to
meet
it
head
on
either
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
or
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
picketing
at
a
delivery
entrance,
that
together
with
other
factors
the
board
may
consider
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
now
you're
not
engaged
in
pure
communication,
but
whether
you're
trying
now
to
get
this
concert
of
action
to
impose
punishment
upon
this
employer
as
such
in
order
to
stop
him
doing
business.
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
think
all
cases
of
picketing
at
delivery
entrances
represent
a
case
of
coercion.
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
total
factual
content.
mr.
david
previant
the
same
with
employee
instances,
yes.
and,
again,
we
point
out
that
there
is
no
such
element
in
this
case.
now,
if
it
were
in
this
case,
then
the
board
would
have
to
make
the
determination
whether
they
were
at
that
employees'
entrance
or
at
that
employ
--
at
that
delivery
entrance
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
all
traffic
with
safeway
because,
out
of
a
thousand
items,
safeway
is
selling
one
non-union
item.
the
board
would
have
to
make
that
determination
on
that
record,
but
i
don't
think
the
board
the
can
escape
its
obligation
to
make
a
determination
by
saying
that
the
minute
the
word
“picket”
appears,
the
minute
anything
that
much
like
a
picket
appears,
the
minute
anything
like
a
handbill
appears,
this
is
per
se
coercive.
and,
now,
we
go
to
the
proviso
in
the
handbill
case
to
see
whether
or
not
the
proviso
switched
it
out
of
the
operative
provision
of
the
statute.
and,
we
think
this
is
exactly
what
the
board
is
doing.
we
say
that
this
is
bad
statutory
construction
and
we
say
that
it's
clearly
unconstitutional
--
an
unconstitutional
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
previant
it's
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional.
in
other
words,
if
the
board
is
saying,
let's
take
this
case,
that
a
picket,
engaged
in
the
purest
form
of
communication,
has
nevertheless
violated
this
statute
because,
in
the
board's
opinion,
it
is
coercive,
then
we
are
confronted
with
the
constitutional
question
and
we
say
the
statute
so
construed,
so
as
to
make
this
pure
communication
coercive
and
illegal,
cannot
stand
the
constitutional
test.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
we
are
compelled
by
decisions
of
this
court
to
distinguish
between
pure
communication
and
communication
accompanied
by
other
attributes,
which
this
court
has
said,
put
--
picketing
as
pure
communication
a
little
above
and
beyond
or
at
a
plus
value
to
communication.
for
instance,
as
this
court
said
in
the
giboney
case,
if
the
communication
is
for
the
purpose
of
inviting
a
concert
of
action
against
an
employer
to
compel
and
to
violate
the
antitrust
law,
then
you
are
in
an
area
which
can
be
regulated
by
the
state.
i
think
if
you
go
through
all
of
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
the
this
court,
this
court
found
in
those
cases
the
plus
elements
which,
when
added
to
picketing,
make
picketing
more
than
free
speech
in
each
and
every
case.
mr.
david
previant
you
--
mr.
david
previant
surely
not.
mr.
david
previant
i
believe
that
in
the
newark
case,
teamsters
union
in
wichita,
kansas
organized
three
employees
of
a
small
dairy
in
attempt
--
one
of
the
employees
was
struck
immediately
--
was
discharged
immediately
and
the
union
struck.
it
picketed
in
front
of
the
dairy
urging
people
not
enter
the
dairy
and
not
to
buy
any
milk.
some
pictures
were
taken
of
people
entering
the
dairy.
as
i
recall,
there
was
no
picketing
at
any
other
retail
outlet
but
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
other
retail
outlets
may
have
been
asked
to
cooperate
with
the
union
in
support
of
this
primary
strike.
this
court
found
no
problem
in
that
kind
of
a
case
because
of
the
communication
aspects
of
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
there
were
three
on
strike.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
was
--
mr.
david
previant
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
was
a
lone
--
mr.
david
previant
per
curiam.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
wish
i
had
faired
as
well
in
the
vault
case.
but,
there,
the
court
emphasized
again
that
you
will
look
at
picketing
in
the
particular
context
in
which
it
appears
and,
if
it
appears
that
communication
is
only
one
element,
perhaps
not
even
an
important
element,
but
the
other
element
is
to
pull
together
some
coercive
coalition
and
direct
it
to
the
employer
to
compel
that
employer
to
violate
a
state
law
or
state
policy
which
a
state
had
a
right
to
adopt,
that
then
we
have
left
thornhill
and
we
go
--
and
each
of
these
cases,
i
guess,
under
this
court's
decision,
must
be
examined
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
david
previant
i
think,
as
construed
by
the
board,
that
would
be
so,
mr.
justice
black,
as
the
board
construes
--
mr.
david
previant
as
construed
by
them,
that
is
so,
yes
because
they
say
they
picked
out
both
handbilling
and
picketing,
although
this
case
involved
only
picketing,
the
next
case
involves
handbilling,
they
picked
these
out
and
they
just
say
“threat,
coerce,
restraint”
got
to
mean
--
must
mean
picketing
and
handbilling
in
a
labor
dispute,
and
then
they
go
on
from
there
to
apply
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
proviso
excludes
it.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
problem
here.
the
--
well,
the
constitutional
argument,
even
if
we
move
from
the
question
as
to
whether
picketing
is
coercive,
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
substance
of
evil
to
which
the
congress
could
have
addressed
itself
here,
we
say
has
no
validity
because,
obviously,
they
say
the
evil
is
consumer
picketing
but
they
permit
--
a
consumer
boycott
but
they
permit
a
handbill
and
they
don't
permit
a
picket.
so
--
which,
again,
throws
us
back
to
the
point
that
what
the
--
what
is
happening
here
is
the
test
only
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
picket
in
the
form
in
which
we
had
picketed
in,
we
say,
the
purest
form
of
communication,
nevertheless,
be
held
to
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
statute.
