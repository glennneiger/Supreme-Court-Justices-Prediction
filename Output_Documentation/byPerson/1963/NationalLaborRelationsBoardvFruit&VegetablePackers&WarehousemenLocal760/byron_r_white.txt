but,
mr.
previant,
if
you
said
to
the
employer
“unless
you
stop
doing
business,
we
will
establish
a
consumer
picket
in
front
of
your
store,”
that
wouldn't
be
a
threat.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
with
your
--
except
with
your
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
in
the
injury
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
result
of
this
argument
is
that
even
if
it
were
proven
that
no
customer
bought
anymore
apples,
just
as
they
were
requested
not
to,
there
wasn't
any
threat,
restraint,
or
coercion
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
isn't
that
true?
i
mean,
even
if
we
prove
that
the
consumers
did
as
they
were
asked
to
do,
namely
refrain
from
buying
apples,
there
still
would
be
no
threat,
restraint,
or
coercion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
i
mean
you
have
to
argue
that
to
make
your
initial
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
--
it
sounds
to
me
like
you'd
like
to
have
this
case
decided
as
a
picketing
case,
pure
and
simple.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
forget
about
the
handbills?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
case
went
off
on
the
handbill
matter,
you
wouldn't
--
you
would
never
reach
those
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
this
picketing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
that
if
you
won
on
your
argument,
that
it
would
have
important
bearing
on
picketing
at
delivery
entrances,
a
secondary
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
with
employee
instances?
