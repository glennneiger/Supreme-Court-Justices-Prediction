justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
solicitor
general,
would
that
mean,
do
you
think,
that
instead
of
two
or
three
--
i
gather,
two
or
three
men
or
women
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
what
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wonder,
is
this
to
suggest
that,
instead
of
doing
that,
they
have
a
sound
truck
that
run
up
and
down
in
the
street
blaring
out
"don't
buy
washington
apples"?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
i'll
assume
that
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
any
first
amendment
considerations
underlying
the
distinctions
in
the
discussions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
--
i
think
the
solicitor
general
was
arguing
it
as
a
rule
of
law
laid
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there's
an
affirmative
burden
on
the
board
to
show
injury
as
i
understand
your
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
be
read
as
saying
"on
this
stipulation
of
facts,"
not
that
the
board
has
a
burden
but,
on
this
stipulation
of
facts,
there
could
be
no
finding
of
coercion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
why
you
read
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
want
to
get
this.
you
been
--
you
do
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
opinion
is
to
be
read
as
laying
down
a
rule
of
law
that
there
is
a
--
an
affirmative
burden
on
the
board
to
have
evidence
which
adds
up
to
restraint
and
coercion
before
they
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
looking
at
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
like
a
decision
on
the
basis
that
this
is
picketing?
nevertheless,
you
want
a
decision
on
the
basis
(inaudible)
with
your
argument
now,
preferably
by
avoiding
reaching
the
constitutional
question
by
saying
that
the
statute
may
be
construed
to
authorize
what
you
did
here,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
kind
of
picketing,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
a
lone
picket
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
lone
picket,
wasn't
that
the
kansas
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
came
here
from
the
kansas
supreme
court.
we
reversed
the
principle
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
just
the
one
line
citing
thornhill
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
we?
