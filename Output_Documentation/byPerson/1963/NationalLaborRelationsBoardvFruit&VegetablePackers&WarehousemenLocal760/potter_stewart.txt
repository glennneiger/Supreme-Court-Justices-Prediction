what's
your
definition
of
picketing,
in
other
words,
i
have
in
mind,
why
is
the
standing
in
front
of
the
entrance
of
the
store
and
passing
out
hand
bills,
why
isn't
that
picketing?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that--
that's
the
deposited--
dispositive
factor,
is
it,
whether
a
man
has
a
sign
on
him
like
a
signage
man--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
there's
patrolling
and
handing
out
signs--
handing
out
hand
--
justice
potter
stewart
hand
bill.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
doesn't
define
picketing,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
definition
of
picketing
is,
if
the
man
had
signs
on
them,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that
they're
carrying.
justice
potter
stewart
but
ambulatory
passing
out
hand
bills
is
not
picketing?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
standing
and
holding
a
sign,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
a
line
you
suggest
we
have
to
draw
that
congress
has
drawn
in
the
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
hand
bills,
i
take
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
just
direct
persuasion
of
the
secondary
employers,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
pressure
on
his
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you
--
what
you
say
that
in
the
fa
--
on
the
context
of
this
case,
there
just
couldn't
be
a
violation,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
such
a
requirement
completely
inconsistent
with
all
the
case
law
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
employer
activity,
dissuading
union
membership,
and
so
on?
you
don't
have
to
show
that
people
are
actually
restrained
or
coerced
or
dissuaded
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
assume
what
the
activity
was.
justice
potter
stewart
then
they
must
do
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
solicitor
general
told
us
this
morning,
among
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
was
defeated,
then
what
he
wanted
isn't
very
illuminating
on
what
was
enacted.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it
was
more
than
just
citing
thornhill.
he
cited
a
specific
part
of
thornhill.
a
specific
page
and
a
specific
section
of
that
opinion,
third,
and
it
did
involve
a
lone
picket.
