mr.
newell
n.
fowler
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
dealers
transports
who
is
the
innocent
third
party
in
this
dispute
between
members
of
one
local
union.
the
question
presented
so
far
as
we're
concerned
is
what
would
be
our
rights
under
the
interpretation
of
this
contract.
it
is
quite
true
that
the
grievance
was
presented
by
the
e
&
l
employees
to
a
business
agent
of
the
local
who
in
turn
took
the
dispute
up
with
the
--
at
the
local
level
in
louisville.
the
matter
was
deadlocked
and
referred
to
the
central
committee
in
detroit.
there
had
been
ramblings
and
of
course,
we
took
no
position
as
to
what
we
should
do
about
it.
after
the
decision
of
the
joint
councilor
who
came
down,
we
complied
our
way
in
the
process
of
complying
with
the
decision.
and
shortly
up
to
that
time,
the
injunction
suit
was
filed.
we
took
the
position
there
that
we
would
not
take
one
side
or
another
that
we
would
first
obey
the
decision
or
follow
the
decision
of
the
joint
national
counsel
and
of
course
with
necessity
we
must
obey
the
injunction
of
the
state
court.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
i
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
think
that
there
was
an
agreement
at
the
local
level
mr.
chief
justice
to
--
to
deadlock
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
the
disagreement.
yes
sir.
so
that
it
would
be
referred
to
the
detroit
central
committee.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
the
representatives
of
the
union
and
the
representatives
of
the
management
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
of
the
dealers,
that's
right,
that's
right.
so
there
was
an
agreement
to
deadlock.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes,
sir.
now,
i
think
that
in
effect,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
was
--
the
first
step
was
bypassed.
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
was
bypassed.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
except
for
the
point
of
saying
this
to
deadlock
this
and
referred
to
the
detroit
committee.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
in
other
words,
(inaudible)
based
on
balls,
that's
about
what
it
amounted
to.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
apparently,
there
was
an
understanding
and
i'm
not
sure
but
i'm
pretty
--
pretty
sure
it
was
in
--
and
that
the
record
will
so
reflect
that
they
took
the
position
and
it
was
the
matter
that
the
central
committee
should
determine
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
question
of
sandwiching.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
now,
i
think
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
the
effect
of
that
deception
was
something
that
we
were
not
parties
to.
i
hope
that
we
were
not.
i
think
the
deception
was
strictly
between
the
business
representative
of
the
union
and
the
employee
members
of
the
union.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that
is
the
findings
of
the
court,
mr
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
justice
black.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
no
findings
that
dealers
was
any
party
to
any
such
fraud.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
oh,
the
--
the
question
there
as
it
appears
to
me
in
response
to
your
answer
is
i
feel
and
feel
strongly
that
any
employee
member
of
the
union
has
a
right
to
present
his
grievances
and
that
was
the
dictation
as
far
as
we
could
go.
our
position
that
is
so
far
as
neutrality
is
concern.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
i
think
that
the
union
certainly
owed
a
responsibility
to
the
dealers'
employees
if
they
saw
that
there
was
a
dispute
that
they
should
have
deadlocked
the
national
committee
and
made
the
--
have
the
thing
go
to
arbitration.
it
looks
to
me
like
that
that
would
have
been
the
fair
and
equitable
thing
to
do.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
alright.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
i
think
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
in
the
first
place,
the
question
of
the
construction
of
that
section
--
article
4,
section
5
is
one
of
doubtful
validity.
the
equitable
thing
to
do
--
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
have
a
third
party
arbitrate
or
appointed
under
section
--
article
7,
section
2
of
the
contract.
and
let
a
third
party
arbitrator
rule
one
whether
or
not
this
was
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
of
businesses.
in
my
mind
there
was
such
time,
a
series
of
doubt
right
now
as
to
whether
this
constituted
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
of
business.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
remedy
if
the
court
felt
--
held
that
there
was
a
merger.
then
under
article
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well
i
didn't
think
--
i
don't
think
there
would
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
be
a
remedy,
no
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
a
remedy
if
the
--
if
a
board
or
a
third
party
arbitrator
decided
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
my
recollection
and
also
the
court
held.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
don't
know.
that's
a
problem.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
no
sir.
no
--
no
grievance
was
filed
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
that
was
the
grievance
of
the
e
&
l
employees
who
sought
to
have
the
seniority
lists
of
the
two
companies,
telescoped
or
sandwiched
in
as
its
known
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
no
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
wouldn't
--
now
let
me
correct
that.
the
company
was
involved,
of
course.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
was
involved
as
party
to
the
grievance.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
now,
if
the
--
if
the
company
had
knowledge
that
these
e
&
l
--
that
the
dealers
were
insisting
that
this
provision
was
unlawful,
i
think
something
should
have
been
paid
--
done
about
it
but
that
was
handled
at
the
local
level
and
not
at
the
headquarters
level
in
memphis
dealers.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
in
other
words,
they
had
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
warren,
that
should
have
been
done
but
hindsight
is
always
burdened
foresight
and
the
matter
did
not
come
to
our
attention
until
after
the
decision
in
detroit.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
knew
nothing
of
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
brennan.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
insofar
as
the
company
is
concerned,
i
am
quite
sure
that
no
one
in
the
main
office
in
memphis
knew
anything
about
it
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
until
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
sir?
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
we
had
a
representative
who
rep
--
at
the
nation
level,
yes
sir,
we
did.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
this
is
rather
peculiar
in
a
strict
type
of
a
grievance
procedure
which
is
basically
different
from
so
many
of
the
others.
the
first
step
as
i
understand
it,
the
employee
member,
a
union
member
files
his
grievance
with
his
business
agent.
the
business
agent
takes
it
up
and
then
if
they
can't
agree,
it
goes
to
a
joint
committee,
i
call
it
the
louisville
some
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
kentucky
something,
whatever
it
is.
then
if
they
had
deadlocked,
it
goes
to
the
central
committee
in
detroit.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
now,
if
they
are
deadlocked
there,
they've
got
to
submit
to
arbitration.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
think
it's
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
think
that
--
alright,
and
the
--
all
the
rules
of
that
would
be
a
(inaudible)
conduct.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
because
if
you
had
two
conflicting
groups
of
employees,
they
should
have
been
heard
and
they
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
whether
they're
right
or
wrong.
i
can't
say.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes
sir,
with
a
little
bit
--
a
little
addition.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that
was
his
testimony,
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
don't
think
in
a
series
dispute
--
a
dispute,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
except
for
the
interpretations
in
the
industry
as
to
the
meaning
of
all
of
these
things.
now,
the
fascinating
thing
about
it
is
basically
what
happened
was
that
ford
motor
company
told
dealers
and
e
&
l
in
louisville
that
were
was
not
enough
business
for
two
transport
companies
out
of
louisville.
and
one
of
them
would
have
to
get
out
or
dealers
was
obviously
far
more
efficient.
so
dealers
sold
its
terminal
at
lorain,
ohio
where
there's
another
ford
plant.
and
sold
the
equipment,
trucks,
trailers,
everything,
just
at
lorain
then
e
&
l
was
out
of
business
in
louisville.
they
had
some
secondary
runs
out
of
louisville.
lorain
had
no
market
value
except
probably
for
bookkeeping
purposes,
the
cost
of
getting
them
transferred
on
the
application,
they
were
pretty
much
up
for
grabs
to
anybody
that
could
justify
--
could
get
them
but
we
paid
e
&
l
for
the
cost
of
the
transfer
and
those
over
and
that
was
the
only
consideration.
so
the
thing
that
fascinates
me
and
has
from
the
beginning
on
this
thing
is,
is
this
a
merger
or
a
consolidation
or
a
transfer
of
what
or
an
absorption
of
business?
we
didn't
absorb
anything.
we
took
business
that
e
&
l
had
been
given
to
ford.
i
mean,
ford
had
been
giving
to
e
&
l
but
we
had
that
already.
the
only
difference
was
we
got
more
business
from
ford.
we
didn't
get
anything
from
e
&
l.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
it
wasn't
necessarily
a
trade,
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
it
was
a
purchase
of
the
secondary
runs
out
of
louisville
into,
i
believe
memphis,
jackson,
mississippi,
shreveport,
and
new
orleans.
that
was
the
secondary
runs.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes
we
did.
but
as
i
say
they
purchase
the
--
the
value
--
they
have
no
value,
you
can't
buy
a
--
buy
a
run
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
you'd
pay
the
transfer,
the
legal
expenses,
all
other
--
those
things,
the
transfer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
now,
its
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
it's
a
--
it's
a
fascinating
question,
that's
a
trade.
no,
we're
not
arguing
that.
it's
a
trade
but
its
fascinating
whether
under
the
construction
of
this
provision
in
the
contract
under
article
4,
subsection
5
whether
or
not
this
is
a
merger
consolidation
or
an
absorption
of
business.
it
requires
some
construction
and
for
that
reason
i
have
the
feeling
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
said,
"well,
we
will
let
an
arbitrator
settle
a
dispute."
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
the
explanation
for
it
was
and
i'm
quite
sure
it
is
that
our
local
terminal
manager
in
louisville
and
our
personnel
manager
thought
that
this
sandwiching
bill
provision
would
apply.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
thought
--
they
thought
sincerely
that
this
sandwiching
arrangement
would
apply
where
e
&
l
had
gone
out
of
business
and
the
employees
were
there.
i
think
they
believe
sincerely
that
they
were
following
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
don't
know
that
and
i
don't
know
if
the
record
reflects
it
very
clearly.
but
we
heard
it
with
a
bang
when
the
injunctions
have
been
filed.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i'm
quite
sure
it
is.
i
can
ask
--
i'm
sure
the
entire
record
came
up
from
the
state
court,
yes
sir.
and
i
would
certainly
invite
the
court
if
they
can,
to
read
the
whole
record.
well,
i'll
leave
the
court
(inaudible).
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
say
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
in
this
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
just
one
observation
to
make
in
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
as
to
whether
or
not
the
first
step
in
grievance
procedure
had
been
bypassed
and
thus
i
recall
i
stated
it
had
not
but
i
see
that
i'm
in
error
because
section
2
of
article
7
of
the
contract
provides
disputes
shall
first
to
be
taken
up
between
the
employer
and
the
local
union
involved.
now
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
first
step
had
been
bypassed
by
the
union.
that's
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
sir?
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
the
record
reflects,
i've
been
able
to
determine
at
the
recess,
nothing
happened.
there
were
just
no
grievance
filed
with
the
employer.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i'm
quite
sure
they
did,
yes.
i'm
quite
sure
they
did.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
the
grievance,
mr.
justice
stewart
was
filed
by
employees
of
the
e
&
l
with
the
local
union.
and
that
grievance
was
presented
to
the
local
joint
committee
where
it
was
deadlocked.
and
under
the
terms
of
the
contact
in
the
record
i'm
sure
it's
quite
clear
now
that
the
first
step
was
not
observed
that
they
did
not
take
it
up
with
the
employer.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes,
anytime.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
yes,
it's
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
well,
by
--
the
first
step
was
not
followed
--
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
--
mr.
justice
goldberg.
but
by
agreement
obviously
the
joint
board
of
the
local
level
agreed
to
deadlock
it
and
refer
it
to
the
national
board.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
newell
n.
fowler
that's
right.
as
a
matter
