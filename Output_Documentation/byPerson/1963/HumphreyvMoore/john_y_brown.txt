mr.
john
y.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
the
position
today
of
the
first
appearance
that
i've
ever
made
before
this
court.
i've
tried
38
years
to
get
here
and
when
i
don't
want
to
come
this
year,
twice
you
take
me
in,
once
one
--
well
i
did
on
the
anderson
case,
which
you
have
and
now,
on
this
one
that
goes
--
it
think
the
finding
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
is
based
on
simple
justice
and
it
ought
not
to
be
disturbed
by
this
court.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
if
you'll
grant
me
this
privilege,
i
would
like
to
state
my
case
and
then
any
question
that
any
of
you
want
to
ask.
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas?
mr.
john
y.
brown
our
court
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
well
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
they
cited
an
opinion
that
you
had
used
and
i
think
it
was
the
lucas
flour
case,
that's
the
case
against
the
brick
and
clay
workers
in
which
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
in
the
brick
and
clay
workers?
mr.
john
y.
brown
their
argument
was
pretty
much
like
it
is
here
made
by
mr.
ralph
logan
sitting
over
here.
i
want
to
take
the
issue
with
the
statement
of
my
friend
here
from
milwaukee
on
his
statement
of
facts.
to
this
extent,
the
record
is
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
transcript
of
it
showed
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
two
representatives
of
the
union,
one
named
a.
d.
berry,
misrepresented
to
these
employees
and
dealers,
will
all
demand
the
security
that
the
other
fellow,
the
president
of
the
local
goes
over
and
makes
a
speech
to
the
--
and
shows
in
that
record,
to
the
e
&
l
workers,
tell
them,
find
a
job
some
other
place
because
the
contract
provides
--
saved
it
for
these
men
and
dealers.
and
if
you
read
that
contract,
you
will
find
out
it
says
that,
seniorities
shall
prevail
at
all
times
and
they
make
one
exception,
that's
when
a
terminal
closes
down.
now,
this
argument
that
they
make
here
that
--
they
balled
out
and
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
asked
the
question,
“what
happened
over
at
lorain,
ohio?”
and
here's
the
distinction.
over
at
lorain,
ohio,
e
&
l
bought
the
terminal
of
dealers.
over
at
louisville,
dealers
didn't
buy
a
solitary
thing,
they
had
an
auction
sale
and
dealers
didn't
buy
a
thing.
and
let
me
show
you
that
that's
true.
when
they
hand
down
this
decision
in
detroit
and
they
--
in
detroit,
in
the
heading
of
it,
they
give
us
their
reasons
because
of
the
discontinuance
of
operation
in
louisville
for
e
&
l
transport
company.
now
at
that
time,
you
didn't
know
it
was
going
to
be
in
a
lawsuit
filed.
and
you
gave
the
true
reason
that
the
e
&
l
was
pulling
out.
and
that's
why,
and
i'll
tell
you
why
they
pulled
out.dealers
came
in
1955,
a
new
organization.
their
men
belonged
in
the
union
just
like
e
&
l.
the
chief
business
was
all
the
ford
products.
ford
doesn't
care
anything
--
why
they
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
you
don't
have
to
have
anything
in
the
record.
you
gentlemen
wouldn't
be
on
the
court
if
you
didn't
have
intelligence
enough
to
know
that
a
hardheaded
business
concerned
like
ford
motor
company,
doesn't
care
and
think
about
the
name
of
the
company
that
they
do
business
with.
they
do
it
with
the
ones
that
do
the
best
job.
and
dealers'
employees
got
the
job.
and
here's
the
condition
--
i'm
glad
you
asked
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
want
to
tell
you
this
answer
in
that
argument.
my
friend
ralph
logan
has
the
floor
and
john
palmore
who
wrote
that
(inaudible)
--
who
wrote
that
opinion
said,
“mr.
logan,
if
you
win
on
this
contention,
court
would
prevent
this
situation
from
arising?
i'm
a
young,
intelligent,
aggressive
employer,
and
i
come
in
and
hire
me
a
bunch
of
young
aggressive
employees.
and
you
have
a
concern
out
in
washington,
it
goes
out
of
business.
and
your
union
files
a
complaint.
if
we
can't
look
back
at
that
complaint
to
see
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
what
would
keep
those
employees
from
out
there
from
being
sandwiched
over
here?
and
ralph
--
now
ralph
said,
"well,
i
would
see
anything
to
it."
now,
here
is
an
equity
in
this
situation.
this
court
ought
not
to
miss.
you've
got
a
group
of
young
employees
who
did
such
a
fine
job
and
used
to
the
same
union,
you
refer
the
fact
that
the
union
took
them
up
to
detroit,
(inaudible)
home,
and
paid
their
way.
they
are
paying
the
dues
of
--
bring
all
this
band
of
lawyers
here
all
the
way
from
saint
louis,
detroit,
milwaukee,
maybe
detroit
sir,
these
--
these
men
because
of
their
very
efficiency
in
their
jobs
find
themselves
in
position
whereby
a
union
ruling,
they
lose
their
jobs.
the
first
week,
96
of
them
are
displaced.
and
it
wasn't
until
they
came
back
here
that
they
hired
a
lawyer.
and
they
--
this
is
a
matter
of
just
--
that
you'd
have
to
use
your
judgment
on.
but,
if
the
union
hadn't
pulled
them,
they'd
had
a
lawyer
a
long
time
before
them.
and
we've
got
a
declaratory
judgment
back
in
our
state
and
i
noticed
in
--
and
the
reason
i
was
a
little
intrigued
by
the
--
the
opinion
in
textile
mills
against
lincoln
mills
is
because
my
friend
bardon,
who
was
a
congressional
sector
when
i
was
over
there
in
the
house.
bardon
says
i
want
this
to
be
a
history,
of
this
act.
and
he
goes
down
there
and
asked,
"could
employees",
he
didn't
say
mr.
justice
white,
can
just
the
unions
and
can
just
employers?
are
they
the
only
ones
that
have
a
right
to
a
cause
of
action?
now,
there'd
been
two
dissents
that
brought
this
thing
up,
yours
mr.
justice
black
and
yours
mr.
justice
douglas,
recent
dissent
in
which
you
--
you
say
that
the
conventional
method
of
writing
a
wrong
ought
not
to
be
denied
and
that's
in
substance
to
your
example.
ought
not
to
be
denied
and
you
say
mr.
justice
douglas
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
too
far
away
in
substance
there.
and
mr.
justice
goldberg
handled
that
almost
as
well
as
anybody
else
because
i
am
not
a
stranger
to
this
labor
movement.
phil
murray
was
the
one
that
employed
me
in
united
mine
workers
and
we
never
envisioned
a
day
when
a
group
of
loyal
hardworking
employees
could
be
put
out
of
a
job
just
because
they
are
efficient
and
that
is
exactly
what
you've
got
in
this
case.
now,
our
court
of
appeals
--
yes
sir
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
that
is
right.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes
sir,
i
will
tell
you
exactly.
mr.
john
y.
brown
there's
a
fellow
named
les
a.d.,
berry,
and
i
wish
some
of
you
would
ask
me
where
he
is
right
now.
but
he
is
not
confident
to
--
for
me
to
volunteer
it,
but
he
is
the
type
of
representation
that
they
had.
and
if
you
would
read
the
newspapers,
you
can
find
it
out
and
you
will
know
that
these
men
didn't
have
prior
representation.
he
had
repeated
the
conferences
with
and
as
early
as
the
morning
of
a
detroit
conference
where
they
took
these
men's
job
away
from
them.
he
was
still
assuring
them,
you
haven't
got
a
thing
to
worry
about,
read
this
section
in
the
contract
and
he
read
it
to
them,
why,
you're
protected
and
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
that's
in
the
--
the
transcript
before
that
--
you
asked
me
about
the
court
of
appeals,
if
that
they
had
the
entire
transcript.
now,
the
representatives
of
the
teamsters
only
put
the
portions
in
there
that
most
--
but
judge
palmore
showed
in
his
opinion
that
that's
the
basis
in
reaching
this
conclusion.
as
late
as
a
few
minutes
before,
they
thought
the
union
was
representing
them.
and
then
they're
told,
“we've
changed
our
minds”.
now
in
the
transcript,
to
show
you
that
they've
been
fooling
these
men,
the
testimonies
in
the
original
transcript
where
paul
priddy,
told
a
representative
of
dealers
in
louisville,
kentucky
at
the
time
he
filed
this
spurious
grievance,
that
i
know
the
thinking
of
jimmy
(inaudible)
and
he
wants
these
men
sandwiched
in
but
he
didn't
left
them
know
that.
you
talked
about
fair
representation?
he
was
sitting
there
as
a
member
of
that
committee
and
gallantly,
he
excused
himself
just
as
if
this
group
here
was
the
committee
and
hear
them
saying,
and
one
of
you
said,
“well,
i
changed
my
mind.
i'll
just
step
aside
and
make
this
thing
fair
and
impartial.
i'll
argue
the
other
side
of
the
case
through
them.
now
that's
exactly
what
took
place.
they
had
fooled
these
men
up
until
the
time
they
got
right
out
the
door
and
to
say
that
three
shop
stewards
who
relied
on
their
union
to
represent
them
--
but
we're
given
an
opportunity
to
say
something,
they
couldn't
think
anything
to
say.
mr.
john
y.
brown
brown
is
my
name.
mr.
john
y.
brown
mr.
moore
is
the
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
do
not
dispute
this
that
--
that
e
&
l
bought
out
dealers
over
in
ohio
wherein
bolt,
locks,
stock
and
barrel,
the
terminal
and
all.
they
withdrew
from
law.
mr.
john
y.
brown
that's
not
in
the
record.
we
contend
it
is
not.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
not.
they
found
justice,
it
says
in
on
the
phase
of
their
agreements
up
there
when
they
thought
there
would
not
be
a
lawsuit
and
this
is
because
e
&
l
is
withdrawing.
now,
even
though
you
had
an
absorption
as
they
claim
and
our
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
no
absorption
because
it
didn't
take
over
a
single
piece
of
equipment.
they
simply
made
application
for
the
rights
when
this
company
withdrew.
they
don't
get
anything
unless
the
interstate
commerce
commission
gives
them
those
rights.
now
i
don't
know
whether
they
got
them
in
the
mean
time
or
whether
they
haven't
got
it.
our
court
of
appeals
in
substance
said
that
you
cannot
claim
that
these
men
had
representations
at
that
conference
in
detroit
when
they're
lulled
into
security,
when
they're
fooled
by
their
employ
--
by
their
union
representatives
and
when
they're
left
standing
there
frivolous
in
the
face
of
this
committee
with
no
one
could
say
anything
in
their
behalf.
now,
(inaudible)
all
about
this
when
he
filed
the
first
--
and
incidentally
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
will
note
that
this
is
an
unusual
thing.
he
skips
the
first
step
in
grievance
procedure.
the
first
step
under
that
section
that
they
rely
on
says
that
they
must
take
it
up
with
the
company.
they
never
did
take
it
up
to
the
company.
they
jumped
over
the
company
and
went
up
to
detroit
and
there
they
make
their
decision
without
considering
any
conference.
i
--
i'd
like
to
pose
you
what
for
the
time
being
may
be
considered
as
a
hypothetical
question.
if
they
are
right
on
that
quote,
that
when
you
buy
out
a
company
and
you
take
over
their
employees,
would
this
court
say
that
if
this
joint
conference
in
detroit
should
make
this
decision,
an
old
company
buys
out
a
new
one
--
now
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
want
you
to
listen
to
this,
this
i'll
state
to
the
court
is
very
important.
an
old
company
buys
out
a
new
one
in
a
locality,
let's
say
at
saint
louis
and
the
new
employees
file
a
grievance
and
take
it
to
detroit
and
that
conference
committee
proves
that
the
new
employees
have
seniority
over
the
old.
would
this
court
say
there's
no
court
you
can
go
into
and
get
relief?
if
--
if
he
it
didn't,
we'd
come
to
a
sad
state
in
this
country
where
the
individual
doesn't
amount
to
anything
and
only
the
collective
group
is
to
be
considered.
the
old
group
has
a
seniority
on
the
contract
but
the
union
that
--
mr.
hoff's
(ph)
union
in
detroit
rules
that
these
new
ones
get
the
seniority
over
the
old
ones.
and
the
old
ones
already
lost
half
a
million
dollars.
i'm
not
telling
you
any
hypothetical
case.
i
just
got
thrown
out
of
court
in
saint
louis
with
exactly
that
picture
because
there's
no
relief
in
court.
i
don't
think
we've
reached
that
point
whether
there
isn't
any
relief
in
court.
i
think
there
is
some
relief
in
court
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
this
court
believes
that.
yes
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
know
a
situation
with
the
man,
the
accused,
its
identically
like
that.
but
we
never
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
we
never
had
any
trouble
there
between
the
employer
because
we
took
the
first
step
that
you
ought
to
take
and
that
is
take
it
with
him.
but
the
union
bypassed
the
person.
they
never
considered
the
employee.
they
jumped
directly
to
--
to
detroit.
mr.
john
y.
brown
well,
i
do
think
this.
that
unless
this
court
gives
an
aggrieved
employee
a
right
to
look
behind
a
contrivance
where
a
union
can
deprive
him
of
a
job
as
they
did
in
this.
that
you
have
left
the
individual
no
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
forum
in
which
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
would
say
that
you
do
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
would
say
that
you
do
not
have
the
same
situation
as
exists
here
because
you
got
one
employer
and
one
group
of
employees
and
i
would
say
there
that
the
union
procedure
would
govern
that
unless
i
don't
think
the
union
by
negotiation
has
any
right
to
change
the
plain
wording
of
a
contract.
and
as
i
told
you,
we
had
exactly
that
same
problem
but
our
mine
workers
got
that
covered.
it
is
said
that
seniorities
stayed
with
the
plan
but
this
contract
said
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
y.
brown
that's
right.
this
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
alright.
this
contract
says
that
--
let
me
--
rather
--
it
says
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
alright.
mr.
john
y.
brown
now
wait
just
a
minute.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
wrote
it
down
here.
mr.
john
y.
brown
it
says
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
my
position
is
that
when
men
make
a
contract,
that
they
have
got
some
right
under
that
contract
and
not
just
a
union
and
employer.
mr.
john
y.
brown
that's
correct.
that
he
has
a
--
he
has
a
vested
right
in
that
contract.
and
i
was
right
--
interested
in
reading
the
part
of
the
mcclellan
report
there
and
the
part
of
the
legislation,
of
the
last
congress,
in
which
they
required
the
unions
to
get
each
individual
employee
a
copy
of
the
contract
which
many
of
them
were
not
doing.
now
there
wasn't
any
reason
for
giving
a
union
man
a
copy
of
the
contract
if
he
hadn't
got
a
any
patience
to
go
over
it
and
violate
it.
when
they
violate
that
contract,
there
ought
to
be
a
court
open
forum.
and
i
think
you
have
provided
for
that.
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
y.
brown
of
course
not.
there,
you
are
raising
a
situation
that
deals
with
the
economy
or
the
economics
of
a
particular
locality.
and
i've
had
exactly
that
over
in
the
kentucky
mountains
where
once
an
employer
could
not
read
his
contract
and
i
got
together
with
all
the
men
and
we
ironed
it
out
by
going
back
to
work
and
let
each
days,
wages
to
be
allocated
to
pay
our
work.
but
you
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
got
--
you
got
a
different
story
here.
you
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
well
my
position
is
that
these
men
have
a
right
in
their
contract
and
that
that
is
a
right
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
that
cannot
be
taken
away
from
them
by
a
subterfuge
of
filing
a
grievance
which
does
not
exist
and
they
lose
out
by
being
misrepresented
by
their
union
agents.
mr.
john
y.
brown
now
that's
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
that
--
that's
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
and
this
misrepresentation
of
their
union
agents
and
in
1960
from
--
in
the
case
of
clark
versus
hein-werner
corporation
where
the
facts
are
very
much
like
the
facts
in
this
case,
court
refused
to
take
certiorari
on
that
case
and
there
the
local
court,
that's
wisconsin
case,
94
362
u.s.
962,
here's
what
the
lower
court
said.
in
most
situations
where
the
union
is
performing
its
fiduciary
duty
of
fair
representation
in
an
arbitration
proceeding
presents
a
question
of
fact.
however,
where
the
interest
of
two
groups
of
employees
as
here
are
diametrically
opposed
to
the
evidence
and
the
union
espouses
the
cause
of
one
in
the
arbitration,
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
there
has
been
no
fair
representation
of
the
other
group.
the
old
is
that
one
cannot
serve
two
masters
is
particularly
applicable
to
such
a
situation.
and
this
court
refused
to
take
certiorari
on
that.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
pose
is
this,
when
a
union
representative
in
wisconsin
can't
do
that,
shouldn't
the
rep
--
the
working
people,
the
employees
in
kentucky
have
the
same
break
that
the
employees
in
wisconsin
had
and
you
wouldn't
take
that
case
because
there
the
court
found
that
the
union
was
trying
to
represent
two
diverging
entries
and
you
didn't
take
that.
now,
here
the
union
is
representing,
not
represent
one
but
being
paid
to
represent
two
divergence
but
they
can't
do
that.
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
our
court
may
be
finding
a
fact
that
they
didn't
have
any
representation
there
and
our
court
further
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
there's
nothing
involving
the
labor
relations
act
in
--
in
this.
here,
we've
got
only
an
old
labor
dispute
here.
here
we
simply
got
an
action
to
construe
and
enforce
a
contract
under
the
plain
provisions
which
the
complaining
employees
as
follows
have
certain
rights
opinion.
now,
our
court
held
that
this
was
a
matter
of
construction
of
a
contract.
in
your
steel
workers
cases
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
had
a
different
situation.
you
had
no
--
none
--
no
question
in
that
about
the
union
representatives
not
fairly
looking
after
the
interest
of
the
ones
they
represent.
you
do
have
it
here.
it's
the
whole
backbone
of
this
whole
thing
and
on
the
case
that
i
refer,
i've
used
as
a
hypothetical
situation.
i
know
of
no
court
would
want
to
establish
a
precedent
that
if
an
individual
in
this
country
is
wrong,
he
hasn't
got
a
forum
to
go.
i
have
heard
--
and
in
the
briefs,
i
read
about
what
congress
thought.
well
i
know
a
little
about
what
the
average
congressman
thinks
and
no
congressman
and
no
senator
in
their
right
mind
will
create
a
situation
where
an
individual
can
be
wrong
and
not
have
any
court
to
go
to.
and
if
that's
circumstance
is
here,
that
you've
got
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
you
can't
file
an
action
in
court.
i
know
that
no
sensible
legislator
would
ever
want
to
do
a
thing
like
that.
this
is
a
pretty
husky
bunch
of
men
that
work
for
dealers.
every
decision
of
our
court
of
appeals
except
this
one
is
on
the
other
side
but
they
let
the
loophole
unless
there
is
a
capital
injustice
and
i
told
them
when
they
started
that
this
thing
is
going
to
be
hard
to
do
because
the
court's
decision
in
kentucky
are
against
you.
the
court
of
appeals
set
a
$50,000
bond
for
these
men
to
get
the
injunction,
to
get
their
jobs
back.
and
the
lower
court
ruled
that
that
had
to
be
in
a
case,
shall
all
--
they
all
offered
to
sign
their
homes
so
now
it's
got
the
intakes.
and
between
friday
and
monday,
they
bring
in
the
$50,000
cash
and
lay
it
on
his
desk
and
they
got
the
96
back
to
work.
now,
men
ought
to
know.
i
don't
--
i
can't
understand
the
statement
of
my
opponent
here
that
the
individual
has
no
rights
under
this.
i
think
an
individual
does
have
a
right
under
it.
i
think
that
the
labor
management
act
meant
for
him
to
have
a
right.
i
think
it
wouldn't
say
you
got
to
give
him
a
copy
of
the
contract.
they
didn't
expect
him
to
know
what
he
had
and
be
able
to
rely
on
what
he's
got.
and
this
is
a
--
i
don't
--
i
read
my
opponent's
brief
here.
what
i'm
--
it
got
a
128
cases
in
it,
the
other
doesn't
have
--
he's
got
about
a
hundred
in
there.
and
i'm
a
country
lawyer.
i've
tried
a
murder
case
one
day
and
an
automobile
accident
case
the
next
day
or
a
will
case
the
next
day
and
i
don't
know
as
much
about
labor
laws
as
you
but
i
know
as
much
about
this
as
they
do.
i
know
as
much
about
right
or
wrong
and
i
know
here
is
a
situation
where
these
people
were
being
mistreated,
these
people
who
built
business
for
dealers.
and
that
mistreatment
was
already
in
effect
until
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
will
vary
from
our
former
judgments.
you
can't
do
a
thing
like
this
under
the
guise
of
a
spurious
grievance.
and
this
is
a
spurious
grievance.
and
their
own
report
shows
it
before
they
knew
there
would
be
a
lawsuit
when
they
said
it's
because
of
a
withdrawal
of
e
&
l
from
kentucky
territory.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
haven't
contested
these
lights
and
my
time
is
all
up
and
i
was
suppose
to
look
at
how
--
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
my
trouble
is,
there
wasn't
(inaudible)
mr.
chief
justice
and
i'll
go
ahead
now.
mr.
john
y.
brown
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
well,
you
know
i
might
be
in
the
position,
(inaudible)
the
speaker
who
--
the
one
who's
talking
on
that
wall,
he
wasn't
looking
at
it.
and
someone
said,
"well,
(inaudible)
there
anyway."
but,
go
ahead
mr.
justice
white,
you
wanted
to
ask
me
a
question.
mr.
john
y.
brown
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
okay,
alright
sir.
mr.
john
y.
brown
neither
of
the
companies
took
any
position.
now
that
is
in
the
record.
there
is
no
position
taken
by
either
company.
but
i
think
you're
entitled
to
know
that
on
that
committee
up
at
detroit,
nobody
represents
dealers
is
on
that
committee.
and
nobody
representing
these
men
who
are
put
out
of
their
job
was
on
them.
but
the
one
who
took
the
side
of
e
&
l
withdrew
from
the
committee
to
make
the
argument.
and
as
i
say,
it
just
deal
out
--
let
one
man
withdraw
from
a
jury
and
then
go
in
the
jury
room
and
argue
the
case
to
the
rest
of
them.
you'd
have
a
fair
chance
of
ever
winning
a
case
under
those
circumstances.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
if
it
had
been
a
merger
situation
out
of
the
older
men,
you'd
have
to
buy
it
because
of
the
merger.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
think
the
court
does.
i
think
the
court
--
now
that's
why
i
told
you
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
do
not.
i
think
they
have
got
to
decide
in
accordance
--
well
now,
that's
the
white
light,
is
that
the
end
of
it?
mr.
john
y.
brown
five
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes.
mr.
john
y.
brown
well,
i
--
i
think
they've
got
to
decide
within
the
meaning
of
the
contract.
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
well
i
think
if
they
make
a
perfect
ridiculous
construction
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
that
a
court
can
stop
it.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
think
it
is
a
perfect
--
just
like
in
saint
louis,
they
ran
this
new
man,
the
oldest
man
on
this
new
company
is
younger
in
employment
than
the
youngest
man
in
the
old
company.
mr.
john
y.
brown
but
the
detroit
committed
gives
the
young
ones
seniority
over
he
old.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
say
that's
something
the
court
ought
to
correct.
mr.
john
y.
brown
asuuming
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
that
the
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
that's
right.
but
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
what
would
be
wrong
with
them
dealing
fairly
with
their
employees
and
telling
them
to
begin
with?
they
didn't
learn
anything
from
detroit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
the
record
shows
that
--
that
paul
priddy
told
the
company
representative
down
at
louisville,
that's
what
he's
going
to
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
john
y.
brown
mr.
justice
white,
this
question
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
--
if
i
thought
that
they
had
--
had
fair
representation
and
that
they
had
come
to
a
conclusion
and
according
with
the
contract.
mr.
john
y.
brown
only
a
court
can
decide
that.
now,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
would
still
be
here
if
they've
handed
down
a
ruling
that
conflicts
with
that
contract.
you
said
in
the
steel
worker
cases
that
they
don't
see
this
arbitrator
to
dispense
their
grant
of
industrial
justice.
they
sit
to
interpret
that
contract
in
the
language
of
the
contract.
and
that
language
of
that
contract
says
there's
only
one
exception
to
seniority
rules.
and
that
is
where
a
terminal
closes,
they
can
come
in
and
take
their
place
at
the
part
of
the
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
wish
i
had
time
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
wish
had
time
to
read
you
a
few
lines
out
in
the
mcclellan
report
because
they
found
that
in
many
times
these
big
companies
got
together
with
the
teamsters
union
and
did
things
that
injured
the
employees
and
when
the
situational
aspect
that
arises,
the
court
ought
to
--
you
ought
to
have
your
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
day
in
court.
mr.
john
y.
brown
well,
i
thought
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
did
make
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
as
strong
as
a
--
and
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
that
--
well,
that
will
be,
they
conclude
--
that's
where
the
sweetheart
contracts
come
from.when
you've
got
--
they
know
about
sweetheart
contracts.
and
when
you
got
a
collusion
between
the
employer,
the
injured
employee
ought
to
have
a
court
he
can
go
to.
we
had
a
court,
is
one
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky.
they
gave
us
relief
that
i
think
is
sound
and
if
the
logic
(inaudible)
it
sounds
like.
mr.
john
y.
brown
no,
no.
only
--
the
allegations
are
that
they
were
misrepresented
by
the
union
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
and
that
the
--
then
there's
the
allegation
that
the
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
that
defining
isn't
contrary
to
the
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
no,
there's
no
law.
no
--
no
allegation
that
there's
any
collusion
between
the
employer
because
i
don't
think
there
was.
i
think
that
is
a
matter
as
the
employer
said
in
there
letters
to
the
discharged
employees,
because
of
your
unions.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
--
look,
i
still
think
that
you
haven't
had
fair
representation
if
the
deciding
authority
says
that
black
is
white
and
the
contract
says
its
black.
i
know
then
you
haven't
had
fair
--
i
don't
care
what
they
say
and
what
they
protest.
and
i
would
still
say
that
if
they
make
a
finding
that's
against
the
direct
terms
of
that
contract,
that
a
court
ought
to
review
it.
mr.
john
y.
brown
no,
i
don't
think
the
argument
would
because
i
don't
think
--
then
you
could
--
i
don't
think
you
could
make
the
same
argument
there.
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
think
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
oh,
yes
if
they
borrowed
out
an
whole
company,
that's
true.
but
you're
gonna
have
to
rely
on
the
company
having
some
sense
in
that
matter
and
that
they're
not
going
to
lose
the
aggressive
employees.
i
gave
you
the
other
illustration
because
this
same
agency
completely
disregarded
the
contract
in
running
young
men
overall
and
the
old
men
now
have
no
court
that
they
can
go
to.
and
i'm
simply
saying
to
you
that
they
ought
to
have
a
court
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
this
to
me
is
very
much
like
the
situation
that
the
age
wide
of
a
great
king
was
then
when
he
had
deserted
her
after
she
had
devoted
her
life
to
him.
and
her
parting
on
the
map
was
that
in
this
world,
justice
is
a
name
and
not
a
fact.
these
men
had
been
loyal
members
of
teamsters
union
and
they
find
themselves
displaced
by
misrepresentation
of
those
they
thought
ought
to
represent
--
represent
them
and
they
are
searching
for
a
spot
where
the
wrong
can
be
righted.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
y.
brown
(inaudible)
mr.
john
y.
brown
want
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
want
to
point
out
that
here
is
the
importance
of
missing
that
first
step.
that
first
step
is
the
yard
committee
of
the
dealers
employees
and
when
they
left
them
completely
out
of
the
picture,
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
was
going
on.
that's
why
they
left
the
first
step
out.
so
these
dealers
employees
would
have
no
information
on
it.
they
jump
on
to
the
next
step
and
from
there
on
to
detroit
while
they
(inaudible)
--
that's
why
this
is
an
important
thing
that
they
missed
the
first
step.
mr.
john
y.
brown
because
that's
the
step
where
they
would
have
informed
the
dealers
of
what's
going
on.
mr.
john
y.
brown
yes
but
the
way
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
their
procedure
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i
don't
think
they
could.
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
tell
the
court
this
morning
that
i
don't
--
i
think
you've
got
to
have
a
grievance
with
your
own
employee.
i
don't
think
you
can
jump
off
somewhere
and
pick
out
a
concern
in
colorado
and
say,
"i
--
i'm
going
to
take
your
job
and
file
a
grievance
and
have
the
union
decide
if
you
get
the
job."
i
don't
believe
that
can
be
done.
mr.
john
y.
brown
sir?
mr.
john
y.
brown
well
if
the
local
union
wanted
to
present
this
matter,
the
yard
committee
of
the
dealers
employees
and
the
employer
would
be
the
one
to
take
it
up
with.
that
way
the
dealers
own
employees
would
know
what
they're
doing.
but
they
left
them
out.
so
that
step
which
is
the
initial
step
that
there
is
a
comment
on
them
to
follow
up.
mr.
john
y.
brown
well,
i
say
that's
what
the
contract
caused
when
that's
what
they
didn't
do.
mr.
john
y.
brown
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
further.
it
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
it's
only
when
they
don't
settle
that
it
gets
there.
that's
why
i
was
telling
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
that
in
the
miners,
we
never
got
passed
that
portion,
we
settled
it
because
they'd
(inaudible)
his
own
employees
can
settle
these
things.
but
there,
his
own
employees
weren't
even
considered.
the
first
step
which
would've
required
the
yard
committee
to
meet
with
the
employer
was
omitted
and
left
out
this
procedure
altogether.
and
i
think
it's
a
pertinent
thing
that
they
missed
that
first
step.
i
think
it's
part
of
the
pattern
of
the
union
leaders
fooling
these
men.
mr.
john
y.
brown
and
if
they
did
--
the
first
step
in
that
is
for
the
--
what
they
called
the
yard
committee
which
will
be
the
dealers
employees.
the
yard
committee
takes
it
up
with
the
conference
and
that's
your
first
step
and
if
they
had
taken
that
step
the
problem
there
wouldn't
have
gone
any
further
because
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
i'm
asking
your
honor
to
note
that
you
always
going
to
have
lots
of
complains
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
the
point
--
mr.
john
y.
brown
--
points
they
raise
is
decided
and
you
don't
have
lots
of
complaints
but
i'm
--
certainly
the
same
but
this
is
a
part
--
part
of
the
fooling
process
of
these
dealers
employees
(inaudible)
security
gone,
they're
alright.
we
don't
need
to
bother
with
that.
