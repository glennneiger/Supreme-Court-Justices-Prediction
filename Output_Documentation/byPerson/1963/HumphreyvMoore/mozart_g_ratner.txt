mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
our
view,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
section
301
encompasses
individual
claims
to
future
work
opportunities
which
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
in
the
collective
interest
allocates
to
others.
this
is
one
of
the
problems
that
was
mooted
in
westinghouse.
the
court
said
there,
when
the
employee
and
the
union
are
in
disagreement,
the
question
is
not
which
may
sue
but
rather
the
extent
to
which
one
may
conclude
the
other.
unless
section
301
is
now
to
be
held
to
have
subordinated
the
collective
interest
to
the
individual
interest
in
such
matters
as
allocation
of
future
job
opportunities,
the
unit
in
which
seniority
is
to
be
computed.
and
the
uses
of
seniority
deserved.
the
exclusive
representative
must
be
able
to
conclude
the
individual
in
all
such
manners
to
the
extent
that
the
collective
interests
predominance.
then
whenever
there
is
a
conflict
or
disagreement
between
the
individual
and
the
exclusive
representative,
section
301
must
respect
the
collective
authority.
we
start
then
with
this
court's
recognition
in
westinghouse
that
any
federal
substantive
law
collective
bargaining
contracts
which
may
be
developed
must
necessarily
absorb
the
federal
policy
of
supersedure
of
individual
authority
by
collective
authority
when
the
majority
selects
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
and
of
course
we
find
this
to
be
totally
stated
in
the
lincoln
mills
decision
itself
in
which
the
parties
are
told
but
for
the
substantive
federal
law
collective
agreements
is
to
be
founded
upon
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
court
said
in
westinghouse
that
rights
"which
under
state
law
are
distributed
among
union
members"
become
vested
under
federal
law
"in
a
legal
entity
recognized
by
federal
law."
of
course
the
rights
so
vested
in
the
exclusive
representative
by
those
and
only
those
in
which
the
collective
interest
predominant.
the
distinction
between
areas
in
which
the
collective
interests
predominate
and
those
in
which
the
individual
interest
predominate
is
drawn
of
course
in
elgin,
joliet
&
eastern
versus
burley.
burley
distinguishes
between
individual
grievances
on
one
hand
and
matters
within
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining
on
the
other.
the
distinction
is
drawn
in
terms
of
whether
the
particular
claim
is
monetary,
whether
it
is
fully
vested,
whether
the
remedy
sought
is
wholly
retroactive.
the
individual
seeks
future
status
or
prospective
benefits
so
that
the
remedy
and
its
negotiation
will
affect
other
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
and
future
administration
of
the
agreement
his
claim
is
not
"uniquely
personal"
in
the
westinghouse
sentence
and
the
collective
interest
predominant.
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
in
footnote
9
of
lincoln
mills
decision,
an
analogy
to
the
railway
labor
act
cases
where
the
individual's
interest
is
deemed
to
predominate
in
a
suit
for
damages
for
wrongful
discharge,
but
the
collective
interest
prevails
where
the
individual
seeks
reinstatement.
those
cases
rest
on
the
view
that
reinstatement
affects
the
course
of
future
collective
bargaining
whereas
an
award
of
damages
for
wrongful
discharge
is
not.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendments
to
section
9
(a)
shows
that
congress
thought
it
was
acting
in
accord
with
the
burley
decision.
as
we
see
it,
this
court
has
always
assumed
that
section
301
embody
the
section
9
(a)
8
(d)
allocation
of
authority
between
collective
and
individual
interest.
in
its
dissenting
opinion
in
westinghouse,
mr.
justice
douglas
with
whom
mr.
justice
black
concord
observed,
in
short,
the
union
represents
the
interest
of
the
community
of
employees
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
wide
range
of
its
interest
are
envisaged
by
the
act
would
give
the
collective
bargaining
agency
exclusive
authority
to
bargain
in
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment
or
other
conditions
of
employment.
the
range
of
its
authority
is
the
range
of
its
interest.
in
this
context,
we
turn
to
smith
and
riss.
smith,
of
course,
was
an
action
by
an
employee
to
collect
wages
in
the
form
of
damages.
that
is
of
course
the
classic
grievance
in
the
burley
sentence.
in
relation
to
such
a
suit,
this
court
held
no
more
than
that
section
301
does
not
exclude
all
suits
brought
by
employees
instead
of
union
to
vindicate
individual
employee
rights
arising
from
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
mr.
justice
black
thought
there
should
be
no
question
at
all
about
the
power
of
an
individual
to
sue
or
enforce
such
a
claim
for
money
damages
for
wrongful
discharge.
now
riss,
it
is
true
was
a
suit
for
reinstatement
as
well
as
for
back
pay.
but
there
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
the
union
were
not
in
disagreement
so
that
no
question
of
allocation
of
authority
under
section
9
(a)
and
8
(d)
could
have
been
presented.
moreover,
on
the
assumption
made
by
the
court
in
that
case
that
the
contract
had
been
finally
construed
by
the
tribunal
designated
by
the
parties
to
construe
it.
the
case
appeared
to
represent
the
equivalent
of
a
suit
by
an
individual
to
enforce
rights
vested
in
him
by
a
final
and
binding
arbitration
award.
riss,
it
seems
to
us
stands
for
the
proposition
of
the
e
&
l
petitioners
here
have
a
section
301
right
to
enforce
by
suit
the
joint
conference
committee
award
against
dealers.
in
this
sense,
they
have
the
right
to
enforce
the
benefits
that
they
achieved
under
an
arbitration
award
as
they
would
under
a
court
decree.
but
neither
riss
nor
smith
implied
that
a
suit
will
lie
under
section
301
to
set
aside
an
agreement
arrived
at
through
collective
bargaining
allocating
prospective
job
opportunities
on
the
basis
of
seniority
to
entertain
such
a
suit
would
be
to
use
section
301
to
defeat
instead
of
to
enhance
collective
bargaining
in
respect
for
collective
agreements.
ford
motor
company
versus
huffman
and
there
are
(inaudible)
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
am
not
arguing
that,
the
duty
to
fair
presentation
if
it
were
violated
would
provide
the
basis
i
believe
pursuing
satisfy
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
don't
think
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
set
aside
an
arbitration
award
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
as
a
suit
that
lies
under
section
301.
i
think
that's
a
suit
that
lies
under
the
duty
--
for
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
not
to
set
aside
or
to
defeat
the
product
of
federally
protected
collective
bargain.
not
to
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
defeat
it
--
not
to
frustrate
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
right.
in
our
view,
section
301,
the
scope
of
section
301
is
to
be
drawn
in
terms
of
its
purpose.
the
purpose
of
section
301
is
to
promote
collective
bargaining
and
to
enhance
respect
for
agreements
arrived
at
to
the
process
of
collective
bargain.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
don't
think
that's
a
breach
of
any
right
of
the
individual
has
by
virtue
of
the
contract,
no,
i
think
that
that
maybe
very
well
amount
to
a
breach
but
its
owed
to
him
under
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
i
don't
think
that
breach
has
any
right
that
he
has
a
right
to
enforce
under
the
contract.
at
least
his
vindication
of
whatever
right
he
has
doesn't
stem
from
it.
it
shouldn't
be
predicated
under
section
301.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that's
right.
my
view
is
that
section
301
has
this
limited
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
it
might
be
vulnerable
if
it's
brought
in
an
action
in
the
federal
courts
with
violations
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
consequence
of
violation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
it
might
be
set
aside
the
award.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
if
the
employer
has
--
either
the
union
is
involved
in
that
adversity
or
it
is
not.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
question
under
the
union
standing
to
sue
or
to
get
redress
and
the
employee
acting
against
the
union,
it
has
powers
to
secure
redress
against
the
union,
and
the
union
certainly
has
power
to
(inaudible)
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
to
redress
against
the
employer.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
that
we
confuse
the
problem
when
we
talk
in
terms
of
an
arbitration
award,
mr.
justice
white.
let's
take
the
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
case
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
i
--
i
don't
see
this
case
as
involving
an
arbitration
award.
i
see
this
case
as
involving
a
product
of
federal
--
of
collective
bargaining.
there
is
no
outsider
here
involved
that
makes
this
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
--
before
arbitration.
this
isn't
purely
justiciable.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
no,
i
hardly
think
that
any
section
of
my
brief
needs
to
put
aside.
i
--
i'm
with
petitioner
in
section
--
in
number
17.
i
do
not
treat
this
as
an
arbitration
rule.
i
treat
this
as
a
product
of
the
grievance
procedure
which
is
an
indispensable
part
of
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
and
i
say
that
to
use
section
301
to
defeat
a
product
of
collective
bargaining,
which
reflects
the
performance
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
to
pervert
instead
of
effectuate
the
policy
of
section
301.
and
then
i
don't
think
it's
what
you
want
to
do
with
section
301.
it's
--
this
is
--
it's
an
entirely
different
question.
he
said,
"what
is
it
that
an
employee
has
a
right
to
do
against
the
union
that
doesn't
represent
him
fairly?"
and
it's
another
thing
entirely
to
say,
what
rights
under
a
collective
agreement
does
the
employee
have
a
right
to
enforce?
what
individual
rights
can
be
recognized?
i
think
that
burley
answers
the
second
and
that
steel
and
huffman
answer
the
first.
but
i
do
not
that
by
next
step
can
be
taken
and
that
step
is
that
because
individuals
have
a
right
to
enforce
claims
which
they
derived
under
arbitration
awards
that
it
follows
that
they
also
have
a
right
under
301,
a
suit
to
set
aside
arbitration
awards
they
don't
like.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
for
myself,
i
have
no
doubt.
and
for
myself
i
have
no
doubt
if
there's
an
adequate
avenue
in
the
federal
courts
available
--
at
least
in
the
federal
court,
maybe
even
more
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
we
don't
have
to
consider
now.
but
certainly,
his
avenue
is
not
301.
it's
not
because
he
has
a
vested
right
under
the
collective
agreement
that
he
has
a
right
and
a
state
in
going
to
courts
to
enforce.
that's
not
the
reason
he
has
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
surely.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
right.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
correct.
the
problem
here
is
--
is
--
is
shaping
the
framework
of
federal
laws
of
301
doesn't
become
a
sword
with
which
to
annihilate
the
collective
bargaining
process.
it's
not
a
problem
of
giving
individuals
adequate
recourse
against
fraud
and
deception
and
--
and
maltreatment
on
the
part
of
bargaining
agents
to
which
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
case.
we
say
that
teamsters
union
versus
oliver
controls
this
case
because
collective
bargaining
is
a
governmental
process.
and
the
resolution
of
conflicting
interests
among
constituents
is
the
federal
function
of
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
the
decision
of
a
joint
committee
in
this
case
whether
you
wish
to
call
it
an
arbitration
or
not
and
i
see
no
basis
or
justification,
whatever
for
calling
in
an
arbitration.
the
decision
of
the
joint
committee
is
simply
a
resolution
of
a
dispute
over
interest
which
the
parties
decided
to
resolve
through
the
grievance
procedure.
and
having
resolved
it
through
the
grievance
procedure,
their
decision,
their
resolution
is
the
fruit
of
the
exercise
in
oliver
terms
of
collective
bargaining
rights
on
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely
the
same.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely
the
same.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
exactly
so.
as
a
dispute
involving
interest,
the
resolution
of
interest
in
prospective
in
point,
the
classic
collective
bargaining
in
the
burley
sentence.
we
said
that
to
envisage
a
right
on
the
part
of
disgruntled
or
disaffected
employees
who
are
disadvantaged
by
that
decision
to
attack
it
in
the
corners
is
to
destroy
that
freedom
of
collective
bargaining
which
is
the
essence
of
congress's
policy
and
which
is
exactly
what
oliver
upheld.
the
only
difference
between
what
kentucky
did
in
this
case
and
what
ohio
did
in
oliver
as
we
see
it
is
that
the
kentucky
courts
relied
on
a
state
statute
--
the
ohio
courts
relied
on
the
state
statute
and
the
kentucky
courts
relied
upon
common
law
notions,
natural
law
notions
that
they
devised
themselves.
the
case
for
the
opposition
that
the
seniority
rights
of
dealers'
employees
are
immune
to
the
authority
of
the
collective
bargaining
representative
rest
on
either
or
both
of
two
false
premises.
one,
that
the
bargaining
unit
is
limited
to
dealers'
employees
because
dealers
and
local
89
signed
a
separate
copy
of
the
master
agreement.
and
two,
that
seniority
rights
are
irrevocable
during
the
life
of
a
collective
agreement.
the
short
answer
to
the
first
point
that's
been
made
by
mr.
previant,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
under
federal
law,
this
is
a
multiemployer
unit
so
that
case
is
no
different
than
it
would
be
if
the
decline
in
job
opportunities
resulted
from
closing
down
one
plant
to
one
department
of
a
single
employers
business.
only
yesterday,
we
found
the
recently
published
proceedings
of
the
16th
annual
meeting
of
the
national
academy
of
arbitrators
published
by
bna
in
1963.
it
carries
an
article
and
only
the
second
article
that
i've
been
able
to
find
directly
in
the
law
of
literature,
direct
to
the
problem
with
merging
seniority
list.
it's
an
article
by
president
thomas
kennedy
entitled
merging
seniority
lists
in
this
labor
arbitration
and
the
industrial
change
volume
of
the
proceeding.
at
page
43,
professor
kahn,
who
had
previously
written
the
authoritative
work
in
this
field
comments
about
the
following
work
principle,
which
as
you
will
recall
mr.
priddy
invoked,
to
justifying
it
stand
before
the
joint
committee
and
he
says
that
it's
application
--
the
application
of
that
principle
have
followed
the
work
comes
at
the
outset
to
determine
whether
or
not
and
if
so,
to
what
extent.
the
employees
of
company
a
are
entitled
to
share
in
the
seniority
rights
of
the
employees
in
company
b.
a
clear
statement
on
the
part
of
the
(inaudible)
reflects
how
usual
and
normal
and
customary
and
honorable
and
honest
and
normal
the
union's
position
was
when
it
found
out
finally
when
it
broke
through
to
the
miasma
and
the
fog
and
found
out
what
the
facts
really
were.
the
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
surely,
it's
the
--
its
labor
arbitration
and
industrial
change.
the
bureau
of
national
affairs'
publication
in
1963,
page
one,
i
was
quoting
from
page
43
of
the
volume.
the
second
argument
that
seniority
rights
are
irrevocable
during
the
light
of
a
collective
agreement,
it
is
shortly
answered
with
the
observation
that
there
are
no
individual
rights
created
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
are
immune
to
prospective
modification
by
the
bargaining
agent,
none.
the
reason
is,
that
collective
bargaining
is
a
continuous
process
and
to
hold
the
product
of
collect
the
bargaining,
the
contract
gives
rise
to
the
irrevocable
individual
right
terminates
collective
bargaining
