mr.
attorney
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
it,
the
assertion
that
the
union
misrepresented
the
situation
in
defiance
to
the
dealers
employees
is
based
on
the
assertion
that
mr.
a.d.,
berry
and
mr.
priddy
told
the
employees
that
the
rider
to
the
dealers'
contract
would
insulate
them
absolutely
against
this
grievance.
now
there
is
not
one
word,
not
one
scintilla
in
this
record
or
in
the
typewritten
transcript
which
supports
that
statement.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
what
a.d.,
berry
and
priddy
relied
on
was
the
absence
of
a
merger
or
absorption
and
that
they
so
stated
to
the
employee.
mr.
attorney
no
your
honor,
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
a
of
section
2
on
page
11
of
the
record
--
mr.
attorney
yes.
it
says
that
dispute
shall
first
be
taken
up
between
the
employer
and
the
local
union
involved.
it
doesn't
say
that
grievance
has
had
to
be
filed.
it
says
that
disputes.
now
whether
the
term
disputes
does
or
does
not
include
disputes
arising
over
section
5
--
mr.
attorney
right.
mr.
attorney
well,
i
wouldn't
put
in
the
terms
of
supported,
he
thought
that
on
the
facts
available
to
him,
the
grievance
probably
would
be
denied.
mr.
attorney
certainly
not.
mr.
attorney
correct.
mr.
attorney
you
mean
to
the
joint
local
committee?
well
it
--
all
the
union
decided
that
the
grievance
was
one
that's
entertainable
under
this
contract.
it
involved
--
interpret
--
mr.
attorney
correct.
mr.
attorney
correct.
mr.
attorney
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
you
now
had
a
--
had
a
quarrel,
had
a
dispute
with
the
dealers.
they
claimed
with
dealers.
they
claimed
that
they
had
a
right
to
be
employed
by
dealers,
to
sandwich
in
on
dealers'
seniorities.
mr.
attorney
how
does
it
become
a
grievance
between
e
&
l
employees
and
dealers?
well
the
same
way
employees
is
not
limited
to
the
employees
of
any
employer
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it
isn't
limited
to
the
employees
of
any
particular
employer
under
this
agreement
anymore.
obviously,
when
there
is
a
clause
in
the
contract
that
says
in
the
event
the
employer
absorbs
the
business
of
another
private
contract
carrier,
the
seniority
of
the
employees
affected
shall
be
determined
by
mutual
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
unions
involved.
that
kind
of
a
clause,
it
simply
got
to
contemplate
the
existence
of
a
dispute
between
employees
of
an
employer
other
than
their
own
and
the
employee
and
the
absorbing
employer.
now
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
you
may
or
may
not
under
certain
circumstances
have
a
question
if
it's
timely
and
properly
raised
as
to
whether
the
first
step
in
that
kind
of
a
grievance
procedure
required
the
filing
of
a
grievance
by
the
employees
of
the
--
of
the
company
that's
being
put
out
of
business
against
the
company
that's
doing
the
absorption
maybe
or
maybe
not
but
that
certainly
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
attorney
quite
wrong.
the
--
mr.
attorney
quite
wrong.
section
d
of
--
on
the
record,
page
12,
says
specifically
that
all
matters,
all
pertaining
to
the
interpretation
of
any
provision
interpretation
of
any
provision
of
disagreements
whether
requested
by
the
employer
or
the
union
must
be
submitted
to
the
full
committee
of
the
automobile
transports
as
joint
conference
committee
if
this
is
a
matter,
pertaining
to
the
interpretation
of
section
5
and
if
it
isn't
that
then
i
--
then
i
don't
know
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
attorney
surely.
but
if
the
question
is
it's
obvious
that
the
union
requested
it.
it's
also
obvious
from
this
record
in
fact
it's
not
only
obvious
it's
stated
in
haec
verba
at
page
55,
that
the
em
--
local
committee
which
represents
the
employers,
all
the
employers
including
dealers
and
e
&
l
signed
the
grievance
and
specifically
requested
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
final
top
step.
mr.
attorney
that
is
correct
because
the
province
and
the
record
states
it
specifically
under
this
contract,
the
province
of
interpreting
it
is
exclusively
lodged,
if
the
question
is
one
of
the
interpretation
lodged
exclusively
in
the
top
authority,
the
joint
conference
committee.
that's
why
it
would
have
made
no
difference
and
have
done
them
no
good
to
hold
a
hearing
in
the
first
and
second
steps.
mr.
attorney
alright.
not
as
i
read
the
contract,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
attorney
well,
the
--
mr.
attorney
well
let
me
suggest
this.
the
record
shows
in
the
first
place
that
the
local
union
did
not
want
too
because
it
didn't
think
it
was
its
province
to
interpret
the
contract.
it
so
specifically
stated
in
this
record.
they
wanted
to
refer
it
to
detroit.
mr.
attorney
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
your
honor
--
mr.
attorney
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
that
step
one
can
possibly,
can
be
and
i
think
it
quite
clear
that
there
are
reasonable
arguments
and
reasonable
interpretation
would
say
that
this
--
does
--
that
the
--
the
first
step
doesn't
apply
in
the
merger
absorption
type
of
case
because
it
seems
to
be
inapplicable.
mr.
attorney
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
attorney
i
would
think
so,
i
would
think.
mr.
attorney
it
could
have
been
if
the
local
committee
--
if
the
local
committee
had
said
that
the
problem
does
not
involve
interpretation
and
the
employer
had
agreed.
then
probably
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
it.
but
if
the
committee
--
the
local
union
had
said
that
this
is
a
matter
pertaining
to
the
interpretation
of
section
5,
then
as
i
read
paragraph
b
they
were
required
to
submit
it
and
both
the
local
union
and
the
local
employer
committee
thought
that
this
involved
the
question
of
interpretation
and
the
record
says
that,
that's
why
they
submitted
it
to
detroit.
there
was
no
--
i
--
i
started
to
--
mr.
attorney
surely.
mr.
attorney
correct.
you're
right.
mr.
attorney
you
are
correct.
and
that
was
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
a.d.,
berry
did
take
the
problem
up
and
the
record
shows
that
a.d.,
berry
was
the
representative
of
the
local
union
did
take
the
problem
up
with
dealers'
management.
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
he
did
take
it
up
with
dealers
management
and
he
asked
them
what
the
facts
were,
what
he
was
told
by
dealers'
management
was
that
there
is
no
kind
of
a
trade
or
understanding
between
these
two
companies
at
all.
and
that
was
the
impression
that
dealers
gave
to
the
union
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
misrepresentation
that
the
union
advised
the
employees
of
what
it
thought
the
joint
committee
might
ultimately
decide
and
it
wasn't
--
mr.
attorney
stovall,
who
was
a
representative
and
an
official
of
the
company
signed
the
joint
committee
reference
referring
together
with
the
local
union
by
agreement
of
all
parties
to
the
committee
in
detroit.
that's
how
it
got
there
because
both
parties
agreed
that
it
involved
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
page
55
of
the
record.
mr.
priddy
--
mr.
attorney
the
--
mr.
attorney
the
--
both
the
employer,
the
local
committee,
and
the
local
union
signed
the
grievance
saying,
â€œdeadlocked
to
detroit
for
interpretation,
signed
priddy
and
stovall."
stovall
is
dealers
transit
page
55
of
the
record.
now
to
me
that
means
that
this
parties
interpreted
this
contract
to
mean
that
this
involved
--
the
grievance
involved
the
question
--
interpretation
of
section
5
and
that
the
appropriate
authority
for
its
consideration
and
resolution
was
the
committee
in
detroit.
mr.
attorney
mr.
justice
white,
i
suspect
that
when
i
have
to
answer
is
that
they
agreed
that
it
was
beyond
their
power
to
differ.
at
that
point
in
any
rational
way
at
all
they
were
in
agreement
that
the
person
to
whom
they
take
any
difference
is
there
might
be
involving
the
interpretation
of
that
agreement
before
it
was
a
joint
committee.
i
certainly
do.i
cannot
understand
how
--
why
parties
would
write
a
provision
that
say
that
all
questions
of
interpretation
have
to
be
referred
to
the
joint
conference
committee
that
consists
of
the
elected
delegates
of
the
contracting
parties.
in
-
in
an
obvious
attempt
to
obtain
uniformity
of
the
interpretations
throughout
the
country
and
then
say
that
when
a
question
of
interpretation
arises,
what
we
will
do
is
to
let
the
local
committee
and
the
local
union,
the
local
employer
resolve
it
to
their
own
satisfaction
and
have
different
interpretations
throughout
the
united
states.
i
would
suppose
that
the
same
considerations
that
underlie
this
court's
desire
and
insistence
upon
the
preemption
doctrine
and
the
field
of
labor
relation
would
quite
ration
to
lead
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer
to
make
a
similar
--
similar
kind
of
collective
bargaining
contract,
and
similarly
best
in
a
single
expert
administrative
agency
if
your
honor
please,
the
power
to
interpret
and
to
apply
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
just
exactly
as
disruptive
device
of
national
policy
in
the
administration
of
this
collective
bargaining
policy.
for
the
parties
to
permit
or
to
allow
a
local
employer
and
a
local
union
to
make
their
own
interpretations
of
whether
this
is
a
merger
or
absorption
under
this
agreement
is
it
would
be
for
this
court
now
to
hold
that
the
procedure
that
was
actually
followed
here
was
a
denial
of
fair
representation.
mr.
attorney
as
i
read
the
complaint,
it
does
allege
that
the
union
misrepresented
to
the
employees
of
dealers
that
it
would
protect
their
interests
in
the
sense
that
it
believed
that
under
the
facts,
the
decision
should
go
in
their
favor,
namely,
that
there
should
be
no
sandwiching.
i
understand
that
that
is
alleged.
i
also
understand
that
they
alleged
in
the
complaint,
that
when
the
event
came,
the
union
did
not
take
the
position
in
favor
of
the
dealers
employees,
but
instead
to
a
position
against
them.
it
is
concluded,
i
believe
on
this
record,
that
that
constitutes
fraud.
i
say
it
doesn't
--
mr.
attorney
well
i
don't
see
the
word
fraud
used,
but
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
tenure
of
the
allegations
is
that
somehow
we
were
wrong.
we
were
misled
by
the
union.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
correct,
that
this
entire
process
as
a
matter
of
perspective
employment
involves
collective
bargaining
as
a
legislative
process
that
even
reading
their
allegations
as
a
statement
that
the
union
told
us
they
were
going
to
be
on
our
side
but
when
it
came
to
the
bargaining
table,
they
turned
out
to
be
against
us.
all
this
does
is
to
allege
that
we
have
a
faithless
legislative
representative.
our
congressman
didn't
tell
us
what
he
was
--
that
he's
going
to
vote
for
the
bill.it
turned
out
he
got
in
the
floor,
he
voted
against
it.
we
were
relying
on
him
to
vote
for
it.
that's
the
most.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
is
that
what's
omitted
and
carefully
omitted
from
the
complaint
is
what
comes
out
in
the
evidence
and
that
is
that
the
union
predicated
whatever
statements
it
made
to
these
employees
upon
misrepresentation
and
concealment
by
dealers
transit
to
the
union
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
they
said
that
there
was
no
trade
and
no
understanding
of
any
kind
between
these
parties
concealing
the
fact
that
there
was
the
trade.
now
when
the
union
found
out
what
the
true
facts
were,
it
did
its
job
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative
as
we
understand
it
under
federal
law.
what's
the
job?
it's
to
represent
the
collective
interest,
fairly
and
honestly
and
truly
as
the
union
understands
it.
that's
all
that
any
representative
can
do.
that
they
did
when
they
found
out
what
the
facts
were,
they
said
and
argued
this
on
these
facts
that
this
isn't
absorption
and
now
wen
go
to
the
question
of
what
we
do
about
it
when
we
merge
the
seniorities.
this
is
--
mr.
attorney
i
don't
believe
that
the
kentucky
court
made
a
finding
on
the
fraud
allegation
at
all.
i
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
have
--
mr.
attorney
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
crucial
sentence
on
that
page
is
the
following.
so
we
have
a
situation,
it's
in
the
middle
of
the
bottom
paragraph
in
which
two
antagonistic
interests
were
represented
by
the
same
advocate.
this
of
itself
is
enough
to
destroy
the
traditional
presumption
in
favor
of
an
arbitration
award.
now,
if
the
union
was
an
advocate,
if
this
was
a
lawsuit,
there
might
be
something
in
that
position.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
union
is
not
an
advocacy.
it's
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
charged
by
congress
to
function
of
reconciling
conflicting
interest
in
this
interest
dispute.
mr.
attorney
no
i
don't.
mr.
attorney
it
would
be
attacked
--
mr.
attorney
it
--
either
--
i
don't
know
how
miranda
is
going
to
come
out.
so
i
don't
know
whether
it's
before
the
board
before
--
or
before
a
court,
but
it
certainly
could
be
because
if
what
they're
alleging
is
fraud
--
mr.
attorney
yes
it
could.
it
could
be
upset
if
that
were
true.
mr.
attorney
allegation,
proof,
proper
finding
based
on
evidence
that
the
union
fraudulently
deceived
people
--
fraudulently
deprived
people
of
rights,
yes
it
should
it
be.
mr.
attorney
well,
i
shunt
every
--
almost
every
facets
of
your
statement
of
--
of
the
question.
mr.
attorney
i
don't
know
why.
mr.
attorney
yes.
mr.
attorney
well,
in
the
first
place
--
in
the
first
place
mr.
justice
--
mr.
attorney
well
--
no,
i
say
several
things
--
mr.
attorney
--
that
they
--
mr.
attorney
well
i
--
i
think
so.
on
the
first
place
i
say
that
they
have
no
right
on
this
kind
of
a
matter
to
demand
that
the
union
be
an
advocate
of
their
views.
if
that's
what
they're
relying
on
that
the
union
told
him
it
was
going
to
be
advocate
of
their
reviews,
there's
something
wrong
with
their
position
in
the
first
place
because
they
don't
understand
the
function
of
a
bargaining
representative
which
is
not
to
be
in
advocate
of
an
insular
view
of
one
section
of
its
constituency.
it's
supposed
to
represent
the
collective
industry
--
interest
of
its
entire
constituency.
mr.
attorney
well
if
that
--
mr.
attorney
no
your
honor.
it
has
nothing
to
do
in
my
--
in
my
opinion,
has
nothing
to
do
with
those
cases
and
this
is
a
completely
different
situation.
mr.
attorney
correct,
but
if
the
--
mr.
attorney
if
the
union
told
them
--
if
the
union
told
them
that
it
was
going
to
act
as
their
advocate
of
their
special
interest,
the
union
was
very
bad
and
very
wrong.
if
it
told
them
that
it
was
going
to
serve
as
their
lawyer
to
protect
their
interest
against
the
collective
interest,
the
union
would
undoubtedly
be
betraying,
not
them
but
collective
interest.
i
don't
see
that
they
would
have
a
cause
to
stand
and
complaint
at
all
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
if
the
union
had
a
locus
poenitentiae
and
then
said,
"well
by
god,
no
we're
not
going
to
do.
we're
going
to
do
our
job
under
the
law."
mr.
attorney
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
in
order
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
you
would
have
to
say
that
when
the
union
makes
a
misrepresentation
and
i
don't
concede
for
a
second
that
the
union
in
this
case
told
these
employees,
no
matter
how
you
read
this
record
that
the
union
was
going
to
act
as
their
advocate
before
the
committee
in
the
detroit
which
is
what
this
court
is
talking
about
and
it's
just
not
supported
by
the
record.
but
i
think
for
five
seconds
that
unless
you
take
the
position
that
such
a
statement
is
made,
removes
this
from
the
area
of
collective
bargaining
completely
so
that
the
union
looses
its
statutory
authority
to
adjust
the
grievance
and
to
participate
in
its
adjustment
that
you
can
turn
around
and
say
and
if
you
say
then,
you're
depriving
the
entire
collectivity,
the
entire
collective
bargaining
union
of
the
benefit
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
congress
provided
for
the
resolution
of
just
this
kind
of
seniority
and
merger
and
absorption
dispute.
mr.
attorney
your
honor
--
mr.
attorney
it
seems
to
me
that
in
union
life,
as
in
political
life,
the
elected
representatives
may
on
occasion
tell
their
constituents
to
see
things
that
may
not
be
true
or
as
in
this
case
they
may
act
on
this
information
and
give
them
a
report
that
turns
out
to
be
inaccurate
or
a
prediction
of
their
position,
what
their
position
will
be
when
the
matter
comes
up
for
vote
and
it
turns
out
that
when
they
additional
information,
they
find
that
they
can't
vote
that
way
at
all
in
honesty
and
in
candor
and
justice
to
the
collective
interest
that
they
represent.
mr.
attorney
well
now
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
where
in
this
record
you
may
have
gotten
the
idea
that
there
is
anything
in
it
that
suggest
that
they
got
word
from
detroit
that
they
know
how
it's
going.
what
mr.
priddy
testified
and
my
brief
contains
an
error
and
have
placed
to
the
--
of
a
quotation
mark
at
the
first
part
of
that
quotation
because
it
does
--
it
--
it's
four
words
to
the
left
of
where
it
ought
to
be.
but
what
he
said
was
that
i
know
mr.
hoff
is
thinking
on
matters
of
this
kind.
there
isn't
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
and
if
he
knew
--
if
mr.
hoff
was
the
only
one
who
voted
and
of
course
he
wasn't,
the
employers
voted,
there
--
this
is
a
bipartite
group.
but
if
the
union
had
the
problem
to
resolve
alone
and
i
hardly
think
that
this
court
could
decide
the
case
of
it
of
whether
mr.
hoff
would
have
decided
it
(inaudible),
if
the
union
had
a
policy
and
a
practice
in
cases
where
there
were
trades
and
agreements
of
this
sort,
an
integrating
seniority,
i
suggest
that
the
literature
in
collective
bargaining
is
such
that
they
are
to
be
commended
for
the
integration
of
seniority
list
in
these
situations
that
it
castigated.
mr.
attorney
yes
your
honor,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
attorney
as
i
understand
it,
your
question
was
directed
to
the
proposition
that
what
if
these
people
had
gotten
word
from
detroit
that
they
or
had
known
from
detroit
how
the
union
--
how
the
detroit
committee
was
going
to
decide
it.
i
say
that
once
the
facts
came
up
that
there
had
been,
the
companies
had
lied
that
there
had
in
fact
did
an
understanding
of
the
trade.
then
it
seems
to
me
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion,
there
would
be
integration.
mr.
attorney
mr.
justice
black
i
can't
--
i
--
there
is
--
i
can
add
only
this.
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record,
not
a
hint
that
supports
a
finding
that
this
case
had
been
decided
in
advance
without
hearing
evidence
by
the
people
in
detroit.
there
is
evidence
that
would
leave
one
to
conclude
that
the
experience
of
the
detroit
committee
and
prior
decisions
in
other
cases
was
such,
that
anyone
familiar
with
them
could
predict
the
result
just
as
most
people
can
predict
results
that
this
court
will
reach
if
there
is
an
adequate
body
of
authority
in
the
cases
cold
leave
within
the
line.
but
i
don't
suggest
either
that
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
seek
forward
dishonorable.
of
course
there's
going
to
be
a
body
of
precedent
developed
which
people
are
going
to
be
able
to
rely
on
a
basis
to
which
they're
going
to
make
predictions
or
else
you're
going
to
have
a
wilderness
instead
of
rational
collective
bargaining
and
a
rational
process
of
adjudication.
that's
what
this
record
shows.
presigned
or
printed
--
i
know
what
he's
thinking
on
matters
of
this
nature
once
he
finds
out
about
what's
in
the
federal
register.
and
the
fact
is
mr.
justice
black
that
mr.
fowler
stood
before
this
court
at
this
bar
and
said
that
the
reason
that
the
company
didn't
participate
at
earlier
stages
of
the
process
was
what?
that
their
are
local
officials
knew
that
if
the
facts
came
out
and
were
known,
of
course
the
absorption
provision
of
the
contract
would
apply.
that's
how
little
fraud
there
was
on
the
part
of
the
union.
the
moment
the
union
found
out
with
the
facts
really
work.
they
invoked
that
provision
for
absorption
and
sandwiching
as
the
company
knew
they
would.
now
i
suggest
that
what
this
record
shows
that
knowing
that,
the
company
deliberately
concealed
the
facts
from
the
union
so
that
it
would
be
able
to
make
this
kind
of
a
mis
--
of
a
deceit
argument.
mr.
attorney
as
i
unders
--
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
nothing
in
the
contract
of
course
suggest
it
and
more
important,
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
provides
for
it.
what's
--
as
i
understand
it,
observers
of
affected
groups
including
the
grievance
from
the
south
are
entitled
to
be
present.
mr.
attorney
whether
it
would
have
been
allowed?
mr.
attorney
no
mr.
justice
white,
it
wouldn't
have
been
abnormal
apparently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
record
shows
that
the
dealers
employees
did
speak
up
for
themselves
and
were
permitted
to
do
so.
but
i
think
a
far
more
significance
to
that
is
this.
a
far
more
significance
is
the
fact
that
the
union
probably
never
hears
a
lawyer
in
one
of
these
things.
mr.
previant
would
know
that
better
than
i.
so
that
any
suggestion
that
they
could've
gone
out
and
gotten
counsel
at
that
point
is
nonsense.
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
permits
them
to
speak
up
for
themselves
certainly
to
attempt
to
make
an
adjustment
for
themselves
--
mr.
attorney
alright.
and
here
if
there
was
a
timely
complaint
raised
by
these
people,
well
now
look
the
facts
have
come
out
that
change
is
now
looks
like
the
local
people
is
going
to
be
against
us.
we
thought
they're
going
to
be
for
us,
give
us
an
extension
of
time.
if
that
had
been
asked,
we'll
i'm
not
saying,
it
wouldn't
have
been
granted
or
that
the
denial
might
not
have
been
arbitrary
or
something
might
not
have
been
able
to
be
done
about
it.
not
a
word
was
said
at
that
time
by
anybody.
mr.
attorney
mr.
justice
white,
collective
bargaining
is
frequently
deceiving
in
a
fact
that
the
grievance
procedure
bares
the
characteristics
of
both
a
justicia
--
a
justicial
and
judicial
process
and
the
legislative
one.
and
it's
very
difficult
without
separating
the
subject
matter
that's
being
considered
to
determine
what
the
process
actually
is.
mr.
attorney
yes
it
is.
it
certainly
is.
it
is
my
position
--
mr.
attorney
if
the
board
were
to
have
been
requested
that
the
normal
practice
be
followed
and
they
refused
to
follow,
it
maybe
that
there
would
be
some
evidence
that
they
were
acting
hostilely
to
the
group
involved
and
it
may
be
that
that
in
itself
would
involved,
a
breach
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
but
to
the
extent
that
what
is
being
considered
here
is
the
legislative
matter
of
the
disposition
of
these
jobs
in
the
future,
the
only
people
who
have
a
voice
as
of
right
compatibly
with
the
national
policy
in
the
disposition
of
that
problem
is
the
representatives
of
the
employers
and
the
unions
involved
they
are
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
in
a
classic
burley
sentence.
they
do
it
to
through
the
grievance
procedure
all
the
time
particularly
and
are
they
entitled
to
this
to
the
grievance
procedure
where
they
provide
in
the
grievance
procedure
that
that's
the
way
they're
going
to
do
it
when
a
problem
of
this
kind
comes
up.
the
fact
that
they
have
a
practice
that
permits
interested
employees
to
sit
in
and
listen
or
to
speak
up
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
a
process
from
a
legislative
to
a
judicial
one
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
union
is
acting
as
the
advocate
of
one
interest
rather
than
the
other
mr.
attorney
thank
you
(inaudible).
