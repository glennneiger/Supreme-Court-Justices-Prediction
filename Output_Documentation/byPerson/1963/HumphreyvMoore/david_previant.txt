mr.
david
previant
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
kentucky
to
review
a
judgment
and
an
order
of
that
court
which
judgment
and
order
set
aside
a
seniority
determination
made
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
case
17,
the
petitioners
are
a
group
of
employees
who
are
adversely
affected
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
are
represented
here
by
mr.
ratner
whose
argument
will
follow
mine.
case
number
18
is
the
petition
of
the
local
union
itself.
and
i
will
--
to
set
the
issue
clearly
before
the
court
attempt
to
expound
the
facts
upon
which
the
decision
below
was
based
or
should
have
been
based
upon
which
was
we
think
is
controlling
here.
the
basic
question
presented
of
course
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court
may
set
aside
an
interpretation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
rendered
by
a
committee
authorized
to
make
such
interpretation
under
the
agreement
because
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
interpretation
was
erroneous
or
contrary
to
natural
justice.
there
are
five
parties
actually
or
groups
of
parties
involved
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
in
number
18,
as
i
stated
is
a
labor
union,
local
89
representing
many
employees
in
the
louisville,
kentucky
area.
the
dealers
transport
company
which
was
a
party
below,
in
the
tennessee
corporation
which
delivers
automobiles
and
trucks
and
interstate
commerce
and
it
has
a
terminal
in
louisville,
kentucky
where
the
fourth
company
has
an
assembly
plant.
the
e
&
l
transport
company
similarly
is
a
trucking
company
and
interstate
commerce
delivering
automobiles
and
trucks
out
of
the
four
assembly
plant
in
louisville.
this
company
was
not
a
respondent
below.
the
respondents
moore
as
a
class
are
a
group
of
employees
of
dealers
transport
company
employed
by
dealers
transport
company
in
its
operation
of
trucking
away
automobiles
and
trucks.
and
this
group
is
a
mem
--
are
--
all
of
members
of
this
group
are
members
of
local
89.
the
petitioners
humphrey
are
a
class
of
employees
of
e
&
l
transport
company,
the
competitor
to
dealers
and
are
similarly
members
of
local
89
and
represented
by
local
89
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
dealers
and
e
&
l,
the
trucking
employers
in
this
case
are
members
of
a
multi-employer,
multi-union
bargaining
unit
and
have
been
for
many
years.
these
employers
give
their
power
of
attorney
to
an
employer's
group
known
as
automobile
transporters
labor
division.
this
power
of
attorney
authorizes
that
committee
to
negotiate
and
sign
an
agreement
on
behalf
of
the
various
employers
who
are
members
of
that
association.
mr.
david
previant
it
is
a
recognized
unit.
i
--
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
case
which
just
called
on
my
attention
last
night.
i
think
probably
counsel
was
negligent
for
not
finding
it
earlier
but
it's
a
non-reported
case.
it's
the
nlrb
case
number
25-rc-1925
in
which
this
same
contract
was
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
litigation
arising
out
of
a
claim
by
the
mine
workers
union
that
it
represented
a
majority
of
employees
of
a
single
employer
who
is
party
to
this
contract.
the
board
held
that
the
unit
appropriate
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
as
evidenced
by
this
contract
was
a
multi-employer
unit
and
dismissed
the
petition
of
the
mine
workers
for
a
single
employer
election.
mr.
david
previant
this
--
the
decision
was
in
february
19
--
february
23rd,
1961.
it
is
entitled
usac
transport
inc.
and
district
50,
united
mine
workers
of
america.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
as
i
say,
it
is
unreported
but
in
the
board's
files
it
is
known
as
case
number
25-rc-1925.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
never
any
attempt
made
to
review
the
case
either
directly
or
by
antilabor
practice
charges.
mr.
david
previant
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
the
party
--
the
parties
to
that
were
local
unions
which
are
represented
by
the
committee
which
negotiates
this
contract
another
union
seeking
representation
at
a
particular
employer
--
which
employer
is
also
a
party
to
this
multi-employer,
multi-union
unit.
it's
a
national
unit.
it
covers
the
truckaway,
driveaway
operations
throughout
the
country
wherever
there
are
assembly
plants.
this
contract
is
a
uniform
contract
and
there
are
riders
which
are
negotiated
to
take
care
of
local
conditions
but
basically
it
is
a
uniform
agreement
but
the
uniform
grievance
procedure
and
it
is
--
as
i've
said
negotiated
by
a
committee
representing
the
unions
and
employees
and
a
committee
representing
the
employers.
mr.
david
previant
it
is
not
the
same
contract.
in
fact
there
is
one
very
sharp
difference
insofar
as
the
grievance
procedure
is
concerned
but
it
is
patterned
very
closely
after
it.
this
is
a
--
happens
to
be
in
the
trucking
industry.
a
pattern
type
of
contract
which
is
modified
from
time
to
time
depending
upon
the
kind
of
freight
that
is
involved
whether
it
is
dry
freight,
whether
its
petroleum,
whether
its
cement
or
in
this
case
whether
it
is
new
automobiles
and
trucks
which
are
being
moved
from
assembly
plants.
as
i
said
local
89
is
also
for
many
years
represented
the
employees
of
both
dealers
and
e
&
l
as
well
as
other
companies
that
are
involved
in
this
kind
of
transportation.
and
that
local
union
gives
its
power
of
attorney
to
an
organization
that
is
known
as
the
national
truckaway
and
driveaway
contracts
for
negotiation
and
signature.
identical
contracts
are
signed
by
each
of
the
--
the
individual
employers
but
on
the
negotiation
a
master
agreement
is
arrived
at.
it
is
signed
pursuant
to
the
power
of
attorney
by
the
employers
--
by
the
employer's
association
on
behalf
of
its
members.
it
is
signed
by
the
national
truckaway
conference
on
behalf
of
its
members.
then,
subsequently,
individual
contracts
are
printed,
distributed
and
signed
by
the
individual
local
union
having
jurisdiction
over
the
operations
in
a
particular
area
and
by
the
employer.
and
the
contract
on
record
here
will
show
the
typewritten
signature
of
the
employer's
association
and
i'll
say
for
the
employers
and
then
the
members
of
the
employer's
association
who
were
on
the
negotiating
committee,
let's
say
for
the
employees
and
then
the
members
of
the
union
who
are
on
the
union
negotiating
committee.
i
think
this
is
important
incidentally
because
the
court
below
apparently
cannot
quite
digest
this
kind
of
unit
and
the
--
this
court
will
note
that
in
its
decision
it
seemed
to
think
that
in
as
much
as
two
individual
contracts
were
signed
that
people
working
under
one
contract
like
the
e
&
l
employees
could
not
possibly
assert
any
rights
as
against
those
employees
who
are
working
under
the
other
contract
or
the
dealers
contract.
this
was
essentially
dispute
of
course
it
is
out
position
that
this
is
a
multi-employer
unit.
it
is
a
uniform
agreement.
it's
binding
upon
all.
it
applies
to
all
employees
in
the
unit
and
therefore
the
court
would
actually
in
taking
its
decision
attempted
to
fragmentize
this
multi-employer
unit.
and
actually
it
was
doing
that
which
we
believe
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
forbidden,
it
has
no
authority
or
power
to
do
it.
the
current
contract
expires
in
1964
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
court's
time
to
indicate
some
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract
because
again
i
believe
that
they
are
very
in
strictly
bound
up
in
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
local
89.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well
no,
it's
confusing
i
--
i
couldn't
see
it
myself.

mr.

and

mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
there's
no
issue
in
the
case
at
all.
the
contract
was
attached
in
blank
but
there's
no
issue
in
the
case.
in
fact
it
was
acknowledged
by
dealers,
e
&
l
and
89
that
they
were
all
parties
to
the
agreement
and
that
there's
no
issues
that
that
has
been
raised.
mr.
david
previant
e
&
l
signed
a
similar
contract.
mr.
david
previant
with
the
same
local
union.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
the
next
page.
mr.
david
previant
the
very
next
page.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
if
the
court
will
look
to
the
record,
we'll
find
that
the
signatures
for
the
negotiating
committees
appear
upon
page
81
of
the
contract
and
the
signatures
for
the
local
union
and
for
the
local
employer
appear
at
page
82
of
the
contract
following
--
following
the
signatures
for
the
--
committee
itself.
mr.
david
previant
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
--
mr.
david
previant
it
--
it
--
well,
it
is
not
--
sometimes
it
maybe
and
i
should
say
in
this
case
there
is
one
local
seniority
rider
which
predated
this
1961
contract
which
dealt
only
with
the
seniority
of
employees
of
dealers
who
had
formally
been
employed
at
memphis
but
had
then
been
moved
to
louisville
when
dealers
opened
up
its
terminal
in
louisville.
and
that
supplemental
agreement
said
that
as
to
those
employees
who
were
being
transferred,
they
would
maintain
their
overall
company
seniority
at
louisville.
the
dealers
employees
relied
upon
that
rider
in
the
courts
below
but
neither
the
committee
nor
the
trial
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
in
kentucky
thought
that
rider
had
any
relevance
to
this
issue
at
all.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
that
--
that
is
true
and
but
--
the
practice
is
to
have
each
individual
employer
sign
the
local
union
contract
so
as
to
eliminate
any
doubt
at
all
with
respect
to
his
participation
and
his
re
--
mr.
david
previant
it
would
--
it
would
not
--
mr.
david
previant
it
is
not
necessary.
each
--
each
had
given
powers
of
attorney
to
their
respective
negotiating
committees
and
each
are
bound
by
the
negotiation.
now
this
agreement
does
provide
that
the
national
truckaway
and
driveaway
conference
is
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
employees
covered
by
the
agreement.
it
provides
that
the
employer
is
bound
by
all
the
terms
and
provisions
of
agreement
by
--
and
by
all
interpretations
of
the
agreement.
it
provides
that
seniority
rights
for
employers
shall
prevail
and
generally
the
rules
set
forth
that
seniority
shall
be
by
terminal.
it
further
provides
that
when
there
is
a
controversy
over
a
seniority
standing
this
controversy
shall
be
submitted
to
the
joint
grievance
procedure.
this
joint
grievance
procedure
again
is
similar
to
contracts
which
have
before
this
court
in
both
(inaudible)
and
riss.
in
that,
it
starts
at
the
local
level
by
an
attempt
to
adjust
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
upon
their
failure
to
adjust
there
is
a
local
bipartite
committee
consisting
of
equal
representatives
of
the
union
and
equal
representatives
of
the
employers
in
the
area.
this
committee
makes
an
effort
to
settle
the
dispute
and
if
it
does
finally
settle
the
dispute
that
is
final
and
binding
to
the
parties.
if
they
cannot
reach
an
agreement
at
the
local
level,
it
then
it
goes
to
what
is
called
a
joint
conference
committee.
this
is
a
national
committee.
it
is
again
composed
of
representatives
of
all
of
the
national
employers
and
all
of
the
local
union
on
a
bipartite
basis
and
equal
number
of
each
and
this
committee
does
have
the
authority
to
make
again
final
and
binding
determinations.
if
this
committee
should
deadlock
and
this
is
where
this
procedure
varies
from
the
riss
case
for
example.
then
there
is
provided
that
there
must
be
submission
to
an
impartial
board
of
arbitrators.
the
--
the
important
thing
in
this
procedure
which
marks
it
off
from
the
problem
which
was
before
this
case
--
before
this
court
in
the
riss
case
was
the
specific
provision
that
the
decision
of
the
joint
conference
committee
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
and
binding
upon
the
employer
and
the
union
and
the
employees
involved.
the
court
will
recall
that
there
was
a
--
at
least
that
was
considered
an
ambiguous
statement
in
riss
where
instead
of
saying
the
decision
shall
be
final
and
binding
the
contract
language
go,
"shall
be
submitted
for
final
decision."
this
is
--
i
think
is
clear
as
the
intention
of
the
parties
can
be
expressed
that
the
decision
of
a
committee
particularly
the
joint
conference
committee
shall
be
final,
conclusive
and
binding
upon
the
employer,
the
union
and
the
employees
involved.
incidentally,
in
the
dealers'
brief
filed
here
and
there
is
a
suggestion
that
dealers
might
have
had
a
right
to
deadlock
this
case
at
the
joint
conference
committee
level
and
take
it
to
arbitration.
contract
is
not
give
to
any
individual
and
employer
or
union
that
right.
once
a
committee
makes
the
unanimous
decision
as
was
done
in
this
case
and
--
and
final
arbitration
is
the
final
set
only
if
there
is
a
deadlock
or
there
has
been
a
deadlock
and
i
believe
that
the
mere
reading
of
the
contract
will
demonstrate
that.
now,
the
important
provision
of
the
contract
which
gave
rise
to
a
litigation
here
on
the
merits
below
reads
as
follows,
it
would
be
found
at
record
10,
it's
article
4,
section
5
of
the
contract.
in
the
event
that
the
employer
absorbs
the
business
of
another
private
contract
or
common
carrier
or
is
a
party
to
a
merger
of
lines
the
seniority
of
the
employees
absorbed
or
affected
thereby
shall
be
determined
by
mutual
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
unions
involved.
any
controversy
with
respect
to
such
matter
shall
be
submitted
to
the
joint
grievance
procedure.
the
contract
further
provided
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
party
to
resolve
all
questions
of
interpretation
by
mutual
agreement,
factors
and
effort
to
preclude
the
courts
from
making
an
interpretation.
the
contract
has
a
printed
signature
as
i
pointed
out
of
the
various
parties
and
then
the
individuals'
signature.
now,
the
facts
which
gave
rise
to
the
grievance
and
litigation
relief,
as
i've
pointed
out
dealers
and
e
&
l
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
transporting
new
automobiles
and
trucks
from
the
ford
motor
company
assembly
plant
at
louisville
to
various
parts
of
the
country.
the
court
isn't
--
is
undoubtedly
aware
that
this
industry
has
been
reset
by
automation
problems
also
among
which
at
least
a
form
of
automations
effect
that
it
has
been
found
to
be
more
economical
than
some
instances
to
transport
automobiles
from
what
is
called
piggy-back.
that
is
by
a
multilevel
flat
car
to
which
are
attached
rails,
automobiles
are
put
on
and
this
transported
in
maybe
20
or
30
or
40
cars
of
such
kind
can
be
transported
then
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
the
other
and
of
course
each
flat
car
carries
many
more
automobiles
or
trucks
that
can
be
loaded
onto
the
average
truckaway
trailer
which
up
to
this
point
have
been
doing
it.
so
these
two
companies
were
notified
by
the
ford
motor
company
that
because
of
its
increasing
use
of
this
piggy-back
operation,
one
of
the
two
company
services
would
no
longer
be
required
at
louisville.
testimony
up
to
that
point
was
that
ford
made
no
choice
in
the
matter.
that
all
it
had
--
to
have
done
was
to
announce
to
these
two
competitors,
we
will
have
use
for
only
one
of
you
in
the
future.
the
companies
then
apparently
entered
into
an
agreement
while
--
i
shouldn't
say
apparently,
they
entered
into
an
agreement
which
was
not
apparent
at
that
time
that
dealers
would
purchase
the
e
&
l
rights
out
in
louisville,
the
industry
commerce
rights,
the
rights
to
transport
at
louisville.
in
turn,
e
&
l
would
purchase
dealers'
rights
out
of
ohio,
lorain,
ohio.
and
again
in
turn
as
a
quid
pro
quo,
e
&
l
would
transfer
to
dealers
certain
secondary
rights
which
it
had
in
jackson,
mississippi,
new
orleans
and
two
or
three
other
cities
down
south.
they
had
made
this
agreement
and
they
have
filed
three
separate
applications
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
approval
of
the
transaction
but
the
nature
of
this
transaction
had
never
been
revealed
to
the
union
or
to
the
employees.
at
least
not
before
the
grievance
was
filed
and
was
on
its
way
up
to
final
adjudication.
the
union
representative
after
receiving
complaints
and
inquiries
from
members
of
the
union
had
a
meeting
with
representatives
of
both
companies
and
he
was
told
there
flatly
that
there
was
no
kind
of
a
trade
between
the
two
companies
and
only
that
ford
had
taken
the
business
from
one
company
and
given
it
to
another.
on
those
facts,
the
union
advised
the
employees
of
e
&
l
which
was
then
losing
the
business
that
it
looked
pretty
dark
for
them
and
perhaps
they
better
seek
other
employment.
and
on
those
facts,
it
assured
the
employees
of
dealers
that
they
would
have
no
concern.
again
the
testimony
is
that
they
qualify
this
opinion
on
the
facts
which
were
then
available
to
them.
well,
the
e
&
l
employees
then
were
laid
off
gradually
and
as
they
were
laid
off
they
filed
a
grievance.
they
claimed
that
they
were
entitled
to
secure
employment
with
dealers
because
dealers
was
taking
over
e
&
l's
business.
and
that
--
in
that
employment
they
were
entitled
to
enjoy
the
same
seniority
rights
which
they
enjoyed
with
e
&
l,
in
other
words,
that
the
seniority
board
should
be
merged
or
dovetailed.
now,
in
this
industry
when
we
talked
of
merging
or
dovetailing,
we
mean
you
take
this
--
in
this
case
would
be
the
seniority
list
of
dealers,
the
seniority
list
of
e
&
l
and
then
you
would
make
one
master
list
depending
upon
the
date
of
employment
by
either
company.
obviously,
although
it
wouldn't
be
here,
this
matter
of
dovetailing
is
bound
to
prejudice
and
to
injure
some
employees
who
may
have
thought
they
had
prior
rights
with
their
own
employer
which
they
were
now
losing
by
the
merger.
the
grievance
went
to
the
local
joint
committee
but
there
is
also
a
provision
of
the
contract
that
on
all
matters
of
interpretation
whether
they're
raised
by
the
union
or
by
the
employer,
such
matters
must
go
to
the
joint
conference
committee
to
the
final
step
for
determination
or
as
it
obvious
that
unless
you
have
uniform
interpretation
of
a
uniform
agreement
it
precludes
its
uniformity.
well,
because
of
that
provision
of
the
contract,
the
local
union
suggested
at
the
local
level
that
this
matter
be
deadlock
there
and
that
it
would
sent
to
the
next
meeting
of
the
joint
conference
committee
at
the
top
level
for
determination
as
an
interpretation.
this
joint
conference
meeting
was
held.
the
union
was
present.
dealers
transport
employees
were
represented
by
three
stewards
who
were
elected
by
all
employees
of
dealers
and
who
attended
the
meeting
at
the
expense
of
the
union.
similarly,
the
e
&
l
employees
were
represented
by
stewards
who
were
elected
by
the
employees
of
e
&
l
and
whose
expenses
were
also
paid
to
the
meeting.
now,
in
the
meantime,
the
union
had
made
an
examination
of
the
federal
registrar
and
had
noted
that
these
petitions
were
pending
before
the
icc
and
at
that
point
the
unions
here
changed
because
that
it
did
appear
that
this
was
either
a
merger
or
absorption
which
would
be
covered
by
the
provision
of
the
contract
to
which
i
have
referred.
so,
when
the
matter
got
before
the
committee,
the
chief
officer
of
the
union,
mr.
priddy,
who
normally
sits
as
a
member
of
the
committee,
disqualified
himself.
there's
a
committee
rule
that
no
member
of
the
committee
can
sit
on
the
case
in
which
he
is
involved
or
which
comes
out
of
his
jurisdiction.
mr.
priddy
disqualified
himself
and
he
made
a
presentation
to
this
joint
committee.
and
he
maintained
that
on
these
facts
that
are
now
disclosed
by
the
federal
register,
there's
obviously
in
louisville
a
merger
or
an
absorption
of
the
business
of
one
carrier
by
another.
under
those
circumstances
and
under
this
provision
of
the
contract,
the
employees
of
the
absorbed
company
were
entitled
to
assert
their
seniority
at
the
absorbing
company.
and
he
maintained
that
the
proper
disposition
of
the
grievance
at
that
point
would
be
to
construct
a
seniority
list
in
a
manner
which
i
have
indicated
where
all
employees
of
dealers
whether
they
were
initially
employed
by
dealers
or
whether
they
came
to
dealers
from
e
&
l
would
find
their
places
on
that
master
seniority
list
in
accordance
with
their
total
years
of
service
with
either
company.
this
of
course
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
is
not
an
unusual
disposition
of
this
kind
of
a
dispute
and
generally
is
considered
by
the
previous
riders
in
the
field
at
least
and
by
some
of
the
courts
and
some
of
the
boards
which
have
examined
this
thing
as
being
the
fairest
kind
of
a
disposition
of
this
problem.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
at
that
point
the
--
since
--
e
&
l
had
no
employees
there
but
i
--
i
must
confess
that
this
speculation
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
but
--
mr.
david
previant
but
since
--
no
--
but
since
--
since
these
other
arrangements
were
made
at
places
where
the
--
their
work,
rather
groups
of
employees
i
assume,
i
don't
know
that
it
happened.
i
do
know
that
there
has
never
been
any
grievance
submitted
out
of
any
of
the
other
terminals
which
were
affected
by
this
overall
deal
as
it
were
between
dealers
and
e
&
l.
mr.
priddy
argued
it
to
the
committee
that
all
these
men
were
doing
--
was
following
their
work.
and
since
this
was
a
multi-employer
unit,
they
had
a
right
to
preserve
their
overall
seniority
within
the
unit
itself
without
regard
to
individual
employers
that
in
the
long
run
this
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
employees
because
it
would
be
a
condition
of
that
industry.
it
might
be
the
next
day
that
in
other
company
might
come
in
to
louisville
and
the
dealers
employees
might
be
confronted
with
the
same
problems
and
under
this
kind
of
formula,
the
dealers'
employees
would
be
protected
and
they
would
not
go
to
the
bottom
of
new
seniority
list.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
of
local
89.
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
a
local
union.
now,
this
--
this
joint
committee
is
not
a
union
committee
and
there's
also
a
suggestion
of
the
brief
said
perhaps
this
was
the
union
disposition
of
the
matter.
it
is
a
committee
which
comprised
of
equal
number
of
employers
and
equal
number
union
representatives
and
no
one
sits
on
that
committee
who
is
actively
interested
in
the
particular
grievances
that
have
come
before
it.
in
that
--
in
that
manner,
i
believe
it
fits
every
test
of
an
arbitration
panel
or
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
held
in
riss
that
it
does
whether
it
was
--
whether
that
itself
is
called
an
arbitration
board
or
not.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
the
record
shows
that
they
did.
the
--
i
think
that
on
cross
examination
they
said
well
very
little
but
they
did
make
a
representation
to
the
committee.
they
were
asked
if
they
had
anything
further
to
present
to
the
committee.
apparently,
there
was
no
objection
made
at
that
point
that
they
didn't
have
notice
that
the
union
was
going
to
change
its
position.
incidentally,
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
in
--
in
an
interpretation
case
or
in
a
bargaining
case
as
this
becomes
subsequently
as
we
shall
see,
that
a
right
of
representation
is
necessarily
there
at
that
point
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
point
although
it
isn't
discussed
in
the
brief.
at
this
--
incidentally
and
this
is
a
--
significant,
the
general
manager
of
the
dealers
and
vice
president
who
is
present
at
the
joint
conference
committee
hearing
testified
with
respect
to
the
transaction
between
dealers
and
e
&
l
and
acknowledged
that
dealers
had
and
i
quote,
"absorbed
a
certain
portion
of
e
&
l
business."
absorbed
a
certain
portion
of
e
&
l
business
which
is
the
language
using
the
contract
clause,
nor
that
dealers
at
that
time
although
now
belatedly,
a
claim
is
made
in
the
brief,
protest
that
it
had
no
advance
knowledge
of
the
union
position
or
apparent
change
in
position.
on
the
contrary,
it
made
what
was
apparently
a
frank
disclosure
of
all
of
the
facts.
when
the
committee
decision
came
down
from
two
or
three
days
later
after
which
i
had
complete
notice
of
the
union
possession,
it
made
no
protest
but
immediately
proceeded
to
book
the
committee
decision
into
effect.
now
the
--
the
case
then
started.
the
dealers
employees
started
to
file
a
suit
in
the
lower
courts
of
louisville,
in
which
they
claimed
that
they
had
relied
on
the
union
to
present
their
grievance
at
the
union
that
changes
position.
therefore,
it
deceits
them
that
the
decision
of
a
joint
committee
was
planned
and
contrived,
that
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
in
violation
of
the
bargaining
contract
although
the
case
actually
was
argued
throughout
mostly
in
the
context
of
whether
the
decision
is
a
violation
of
the
contract.
it
does
smack
in
some
areas,
the
pleading
down
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
perhaps
some
arbitrary
or
capricious
action
but
were
satisfied
that
on
the
record,
neither
does
the
complaint
plead
an
adequate
cause
of
action
nor
was
such
cause
of
action
be
sustained
by
the
record.
now,
i
have
perhaps
taken
too
much
time
in
the
exposition
of
the
facts
but
we
do
feel
that
these
facts
really
are
the
operative
facts
and
should
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
decided
law
under
the
trilogy,
under
riss,
under
cases
dealing
with
the
right
of
the
collective
bargaining
agent
to
negotiate
seniority
problems
and
other
problems
based
of
that
kind.
that
aspect
of
the
argument
and
as
much
as
i've
taken
as
much
time
as
i
have
i
will
turn
over
to
my
associate
mr.
ratner.
thank
you.
