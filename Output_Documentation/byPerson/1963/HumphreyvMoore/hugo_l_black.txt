(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
complaint
seems
to
alleged
that
that
was
because
the
union
deceived
the
workman
and
the
court
seems
to
have
found
it,
did
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there
--
that
there
was
a
scheme
and
contrivance,
the
complaint
alleged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
union
and
the
others,
deceived
the
workers
and
they
put
up
this
sham
agreement
that
the
deadlock
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
that
caused
you
to
go
up
to
the
head
phase
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
if
the
union
president
who
had
deceived
the
worker
went
up
and
the
representative
decided
against
the
workers
before
the
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
drawing
for
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
seems
to
be
what
the
court
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
position?
what
is
your
position
about
the
effect
that
deception
in
connection
with
this
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
position
--
the
allegation
seems
to
be
that
there
were
--
they
bypassed
the
regular
jury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
order
to
deceive
the
workers,
and
one
of
them
went
through
a
sham
meeting
before
the
detroit
board,
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
according
to
plan,
it
was
decided
against
the
workers
and
the
union
had
told,
would
be
decided
when
he
had
thought
it
would
be
decided
in
their
favor,
is
that
--
is
that
what
was
alleged
in
truman
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
true,
what
in
your
judgment
is
the
proper
remedy
to
be
--
to
avoid
the
--
to
defeat
any
such
of
a
judgment
reached
to
fraud
and
cheating
and
contrivance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
workers
now,
not
dealers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
if
it
goes
to
a
grievance
committee
which
is
in
reality
not
a
grievance
committee
but
a
contrivance
which
is
not
impartial
brought
about
by
the
union
deceiving
the
workers,
what
is
their
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
remedy
if
that
was
not
done
and
the
workers
have
been
deprived
of
their
right
by
chicanery
and
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
union
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
through
a
sup
--
suppose
been
found
through
the
grievance
provision
which
is
not
as
--
really
a
compliance
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
board,
it
decided
it
was
--
was
a
merger.
suppose
the
charges
made
and
the
court
will
find
that
the
board
that
decided
this
was
a
merger
was
set
up
through
fraud
and
chicanery
against
the
workers.
what
is
the
remedy
of
the
workers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
court
held,
suppose
the
board
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
allegations
it
is
that
while
this
board
did
make
that
finding
and
did
so
interpret
the
contract
that
this
was
a
result
of
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
union,
it
really
was
not
a
bona
fide
finding
at
all
by
a
bona
fide
board
because
the
result,
there
was
conspiracy.
is
that
what
the
court
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
the
case,
what's
the
remedy
of
the
worker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
had
told
the
man
in
the
union
that
we're
going
to
do
that,
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
man
accepted
it
and
the
men
didn't
do
anything
and
he
went
there
and
he
did
precisely
to
the
contrary.
would
that
be
the
kind
of
representation
by
a
union
that
we've
held
that
to
be
given
in
cases
of
the
people
who
were
discriminated
against
because
they
were
colored?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
i
didn't
say
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
they
held
that
the
union
had
to
represent
them
squarely
and
fairly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
that
would
be
squarely
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
he
wanted
(inaudible)
if
there
are
any
charge,
the
individuals
who
have
been
deceived
by
the
union
thinking
they
were
going
to
certain
things
for
them
should
have
a
right
to
be
informed
so
that
they
could
do
something
for
themselves?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
he
might
be
simply
saying
that
if
the
union's
representative
has
to
tell
to
the
workers
the
truth
and
not
deceive
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
is
that
some
kind
of
a
remedy
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
fact
that
they
told
them
in
view,
we'll
deadlock
it,
assuming
that's
true
that
it
get
up
to
this
door
and
we
have
word
from
the
president
of
an
(inaudible)
national
that
the
decision
will
be
all
right
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
so.
that's
not
the
issue
in
the
connection
rather
they
were
deceived.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
misrepresentation,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
--
even
though
it's
been
decided
--
even
though
it's
been
decided
in
advanced
without
hearing
any
--
any
argument
or
any
evidence,
do
you
say
it
be
all
right
if
they
decide
it
according
to
what
you
say
is
right?
