well,
i'd
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
did
either
or
both
of
the
companies
take
a
position
in
these
proceeding
on
behalf
of
their
employees?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
have
five
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fowler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fowler,
i
understood
mr.
brown
to
say
that
you
didn't
have
that
proceeding,
the
original
proceeding
that
it
would
just
bypass,
they
didn't
even
consult
your
company
that
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
they
went
to
--
directly
to
detroit.
now,
which
is
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
fowler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fowler
did
you
--
was
there
any
grievance
between
your
company
and
your
employees?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
what
was
the
provocation
for
having
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
had
an
organization
there.
you
had
some
employees
who
were
--
who
were
affected,
were
you
a
party
to
that
grievance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
company
wasn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
involved
in
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
grievance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
--
that
--
that
seems
to
me
doesn't
dispose
of
it.
if
your
company
had
a
grievance
with
your
--
were
parties
to
the
grievance
with
your
employees
and
there
was
a
grievance
procedure
provided
for
in
the
contract
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
didn't
you
go
through
with
it
and
have
a
hearing
so
that
they
could
have
--
made
manifest
what
their
--
what
their
grievance
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
--
didn't
just
say,
"well,
we'll
deadlock
this
thing
and
settle
it
up
to
detroit"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
you
--
didn't
you
get
some
rights
from
some
other
places?
i
thought
you
traded
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
you
would
purchase
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
purchase
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
i
under
--
as
i
gathered
from
reading
the
--
reading
the
briefs
of
--
e
&
l
gave
--
gave
up
their
business
to
--
at
this
particular
place
at
louisville,
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
their
business
with
the
ford
plant
and
your
company
gave
up
its
business
in
some
other
place
that
--
where
they
would
be
the
beneficiaries
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
your
abandonment
of
it
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
--
that
will
--
wasn't
that
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
that
a
trade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
sort
of
a
trade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
thing
that
i
was
wondering
about
was,
here
you
have
some
employees
in
--
in
louisville
who
are
working
for
you
and
--
and
because
of
this
change
in
the
way
of
doing
business,
the
question
arises
as
to
--
as
to
whether
your
own
people
are
to
remain
in
your
employer
or
whether
you're
going
to
have
let
them
go
and
take
someone
from
the
outside.
yet
you
showed
no
interest
at
all
in
the
proceeding
which
determined
whether
your
own
employees
were
to
remain
with
you
or
not,
that
--
what
is
the
explanation
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
know
that
--
did
they
know
that
your
own
employees
were
of
the
contrary
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

justice
