justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
ought
to
be
able
to
sue
to
set
aside
an
arbitration
award.
i
mean,
is
that
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some
--
there
are
some
cases
in
which
the
individual
may
bring
a
301
suit
set
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well
again
then,
are
there
any
suits
that
the
individual
may
bring
under
section
301?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difference
there
is
it
--
wouldn't
you
say
it's
not
a
301
suit
rather
than
he
wouldn't
have
a
standing
with
the
right
to
sue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
employer
pays
the
arbitrator
to
--
or
the
union
pays
the
arbitrator
or
somebody
pays
the
arbitrator
to
come
to
a
certain
conclusion.
you
don't
think
that's
a
breach
of
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
for
whatever
reasons
an
arbitration
award
might
be
vulnerable,
do
you
think
that
it's
never
vulnerable
under
section
301?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
vulnerable
under
--
under
--
in
what
kind
of
an
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it's
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
union
is
--
what
if
the
--
its
employer
that's
involved,
assume
that
the
employers
paid
the
arbitrators,
what
happen
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
it
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
union
isn't
involved
at
all,
no
claim
is
made,
your
attitude
is
the
employee
hasn't
--
no
standing
at
all
because
it's
the
union
who
can
take
the
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
--
we
put
aside
one
section
of
your
brief,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
was
a
merger
situation,
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
the
provision
in
the
contract
would
--
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
now,
whom
--
who
do
you
suppose
has
the
duty
of
deciding
when
it
is
a
merger
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
--
you
don't
think
this
joint
--
this
joint
committee
has
the
--
has
the
authority
under
the
contract
to
decide
to
what
situation
section
7
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got
five
minutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
had
the
initial
authority
to
decide.
but
do
you
think,
your
court
can
second
guess
them
their
construction
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
this
one
works.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
like
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
essentially,
what
the
joint
committee
did
was,
say,
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
--
this
is
a
type
of
an
amalgamation
or
of
an
absorption
to
which
this
provision
applies.
and
the
--
that's
then
the
contract
means
this
and
therefore
the
seniority
--
there's
got
to
be
--
have
to
be
phased
in
with
one
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
they
said,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
this
was
the
--
this
was
a
--
this
is
ridiculous
that
the
court
ought
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
let
me
ask
you
this
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
that
there
had
been
fair
--
in
your
mind,
fair
representation
of
both
groups
of
employees
before
the
committee,
the
joint
committee.
and
the
joint
committee
had
come
to
absolutely
the
same
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that's
another
--
but
sort
of
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
still
be
here
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
though
a
contract
--
a
contract
says
that
if
a
particular
board
or
committee
is
to
have
to
authority
to
interpret
the
contract
and
that
both
parties
agreed
that
their
decision
would
be
final,
the
court
could
nevertheless
second
guess
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
interpretation.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
i
would
--
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
you
when
somebody
makes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
an
allegation
like
that
in
a
--
in
a
complaint
that
there
has
been
collusion
or
something
but
who
is
--
who
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
collusion
is
that
in
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
--
nothing
in
this
record.
there's
no
allegation
of
any
collusion
if
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
--
if
both
factions
had
had
fair
representation,
you'd
still
contend
that
the
--
the
court
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
should
supervise
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
you
are
--
your
arguments
about
the
fairness
of
this
dealers
employees
would
be
the
same
if
there
had
been
merger,
a
good
energetic
group
of
young
employees
get
--
because
they
have
been
successful
yet
lose
their
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
effect
on
them
would
be
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
representative
of
the
merge
committee.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
a
representative
on
the
joint
committee?
