mr.
richard
f.
generelly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
considerable
amount
of
water
has
gone
over
the
dam
in
the
10
years,
since
this
court's
decision
in
phillips
versus
wisconsin,
most
of
it,
in
the
last
four
now
almost
five
years
since
catco.
in
the
course
of
this
10
years
since
first
phillips,
the
producing
industry
as
a
whole
has
experienced
what
it
means
to
be
regulated
and
it
has
not
been
easy
nor
pleasant
experience.
it
may
therefore
seem
somewhat
paradoxical
that
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
independent
producers
and
at
one
time
believed
themselves
exempt
from
regulation
of
the
federal
power
commission,
are
here
today
before
this
court
contending
for
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
right
to
be
treated
as
natural
gas
companies
under
the
natural
gas
act.
briefly
stated,
it
is
our
position
as
this
court
has
held.
but
i
--
if
a
producer
of
gas
become
subject
to
the
duties,
obligations
and
restraints
imposed
on
natural
gas
companies
by
congress
under
the
natural
gas
act,
once
he
begins
his
sale
in
interstate
commerce,
then
he
should
be
entitled
at
that
point
to
the
rights
accorded
and
reserved
to
natural
gas
companies
by
congress
under
the
act.
now,
we
believe
the
court
below
is
eminently
correct
and
so
holding.
the
commission
relies
hardly
enough
on
the
same
cases
on
which
we
rely,
catco
and
mobile.
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
the
commission
has
misread
both
decisions
or
at
least
has
ceased
upon
certain
language,
certainly
in
catco,
and
misused
it
really
out
of
context
to
support
his
position
in
this
case.
now,
we
quoted
that
some
length
in
our
brief
from
the
court's
decision
and
i
must
apologize
for
that,
say
if
--
it
seemed
to
be
so
clear
to
us
that
i
--
i
didn't
know
how
else
to
state
it.
now,
one
thing
i
did
not
quote,
but
i
would
like
to
review
very
briefly.
to
begin,
in
catco
that
either
3
--
360,
388,
or
389,
justice
clark
stated
that
"the
heart
of
the
act
is
found
in
all
those
provisions
requiring
initially
that
any
proposed
service,
sale,
operation,
construction,
extension
or
acquisition
will
be
required
by
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity,
and
that
all
rates,
charges
made,
demand
of
the
receipt
shall
be
just
and
reasonable."
this
was
1938,
about
65
years
ago
where
it
shall
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
court
went
on
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
believe
sir
that
it
is
388
or
389,
i
happen
to
have
a
388.
thank
you,
mr.
solomon.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
act
prohibits
such
movements
of
gas
unless
and
until
the
commission
issues
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
court
notes
that
section
7
(c)
vest
on
the
commission
control
of
the
conditions
under
which
gas
maybe
initially
dedicated
to
interstate
market.
and
then
once
so
dedicated,
there
can
be
no
withdrawal
of
that
supply
from
continued
interstate
movement
without
the
commission's
approval."
now,
the
very
next
sentence,
the
gas
operator,
although
to
this
extent,
of
captive
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
is
not
without
remedy
to
protect
himself.
what
is
that
remedy?
he
may,
unless
otherwise
bound
by
contract,
not
with
commission
permission.
he
may,
unless
otherwise
bound
by
contract
citing
mobile,
file
new
rate
schedules
with
the
commission,
having
once
started
at
a
lower
conditioned
price.
this
rate
becomes
effective
upon
its
filings,
submit
five
months
suspension
period
of
--
of
section
4,
the
posting
of
a
bond
were
require.
this
not
only
gives
the
natural
gas
company
opportunity
to
increase
its
rates
were
justifying,
and
bear
in
mind,
the
commission
has
never
found
in
this
particular
case
whether
it
was
justified
or
not.
they
simply
rejected
our
filings.
but
likewise,
guarantees
that
the
consumer
may
recover
refunds
for
moneys
paid
under
excessive
increases,
the
overwriting
of
intent
of
congress
to
give
full
protective
coverage
to
the
consumer.
as
to
prices,
further
emphasized
in
section
5
of
the
act
which
authorizes
the
commission
sua
sponte
or
otherwise
but
not
--
would
not
be
so
naive,
as
to
suggest
on
the
request
of
a
producer.
but
sua
sponte
or
state
commission
to
somebody
under
section
5,
to
institute
an
investigation
and
to
existing
rates
and
charges
and
to
fix
them
to
a
just
and
reasonable
bond.
the
court
found
that
under
this
section
however,
the
rate
found
by
the
commission
to
be
just
and
reasonable,
comes
to
effect
only
prospectively.
gas
purchasers,
therefore,
have
no
protection
from
excessive
charges
collected
during
the
pendency
of
section
5.
now,
in
this
case,
first
let
me
say,
if
i
understand
the
english
language,
i
will
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
i
have
read
it
nor
any
case
cited
by
this
court
which
lends
any
support
whatsoever
for
the
proposition
that
an
agency
may
condition
out,
write
out,
and
nullify
that
all
practical
effects
the
section
of
the
very
act,
it
was
required
by
congress
to
administer,
and
that
i
respectfully
submit
is
what
they've
done
here.
now,
the
court
is
aware
of
its
own
decisions
and
i
won't
spend
anymore
time
on
the
law.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
commission
is
wrong
on
the
law.
so
let's
get
to
the
factual
part
of
this
thing.
this
has
a
somewhat
complicated
beginning.
it
might,
however,
be
somewhat
less
complicated
if
we
adapt
a
little
shorthand
method
here
at
the
outset.
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
318
of
the
record,
you
will
see
a
number
of
cases
there
on
the
caption.
they
all
are
prefixed
in
numbers
with
g.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
318,
i'm
sorry,
318.
these
are
the
g
number
cases.
you'll
notice
hassie
hunt
trust,
g
number
19115.
these
are
g
numbers.
now,
the
cases
that
are
actually
involved
here
are
the
so-called
"ci
dockets"
and
that
means
certificate
independent
producer.
in
the
interim
period,
the
commission
adopted
a
new
method
of
designating
these
things.
so
in
all
subsequent
proceedings,
it
has
been
convenient
to
refer
to
the
g
numbers
or
the
g
dockets
and
the
ci
dockets.
we
have
to
start
with
the
g
dockets.
in
may
of
1959,
after
eight
years
of
putting
together
a
rather
large
package,
to
we
use
that
phrase,
of
gas,
these
producers,
not
all
of
them,
and
some
others
who
are
not
here,
entered
into
a
series
of
long,
firm
contracts,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
to
sell
gas
from
a
number
of
fields
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
at
a
price
of
20
cents.
sales
had
been
previously
certificated
in
the
same
fields,
from
the
same
wells,
permanent
certification
to
another
pipeline
at
20
cents
per
mcf.
the
contracts
provided
these
were
the
may
1959
contracts
for
four
--
for
a
two-cent
escalation
every
four
years.
the
producers
including
hassie
hunt
trust
in
g
19115
--
remember
hassie
hunt
trust
is
also
here
in
this
case
under
a
ci
docket.
hassie
hunt
trust
in
that
case,
to
use
--
again,
we
can
use
the
same
example,
did
not
ask
for
a
temporary
certificate.
it
went
to
a
full
hearing
and
a
hearing
was
held.
now,
this
gas
is
sold
in
chicago,
none
of
it
goes
to
the
state
of
new
york.
the
public
service
commission
of
new
york
sought
to
intervene.
the
commission
denied
them
intervention
on
the
grounds
that
they
couldn't
possibly
be
aggrieved
in
the
sense
that
nobody
in
new
york
would
be
aggrieved
by
the
price
of
gas
in
chicago.
they
were
excluded
from
intervention.
permanent
certificates
were
issued
requiring
that
the
periodic
escalations
in
the
future
be
modified
to
conform
to
the
trunkline
pattern
which
was
an
increase,
one
increase
after
10
years.
with
serious
misgivings
and
reservations,
the
respondents,
some
of
them
there,
hassie
hunt
trust
among
others,
sought
rehearing
for
testing
that.
i
say
serious
reservations
because
as
the
court
below
found
if
you
seek
rehearing,
the
chances
are
things
may
get
worse
rather
than
better.
and
sure
enough,
they
got
worse.
the
commission
reduced
the
20-cent
price
with
respect
to
sales
and
a
couple
of
other
districts.
well,
it
said
you
can
--
we'll
put
back
in
your
periodic
escalations
in
that
case.
in
any
event,
this
gas
had
been
in
the
making
as
it
were
this
project
for
some
eight
years.
so
the
producers
accepted
the
certificate,
began
their
sales.
the
new
york
commission
went
to
court
and
said,
"under
that
regulations
and
rules
of
the
federal
power
commission,
we
are
entitled
to
intervene
in
any
proceeding
irrespective
of
our
interest."
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
they
were.
it
held
nothing
more.
it
didn't
have
the
certificate
order
before
it.
nothing
was
said
about
it,
judge
fahy
said,
"why
do
you
want
to
get
into
that
proceeding?"
he
said,
"so
i
can
take
an
appeal
from
it."
in
the
mean
time,
hassie
hunt
trust
and
the
other
producers
who
are
here
under
the
ci
dockets
had
drilled
additional
wells.
and
i
might
say,
though
this
isn't
revealed
by
the
record,
i
--
it
maybe
somewhere
in
here
but
that
they
drilled
them
more
or
less
an
expectation
that
the
20-cent
price
would
make
it
worthwhile.
it
cost
about
$2000
a
day
to
maintain
a
drilling
well
out
in
the
field.
and
these,
respondents
here,
have
spent
about
$10
million
a
year
looking
for
gas
and
oil
to
be
sure.
but
they've
got
to
think
in
terms
of
what
it's
going
to
cost
to
bring
this
forth
and
then
what
they're
going
to
get
in
return
over
a
long
period
of
time.
we
went
to
natural
gas
pipeline,
it
was
logical,
and
said,
"we've
drilled
additional
wells
in
the
same
fields."
let's
put
them
under
the
same
contract
which
we
had
originally
proposed
and
we'll
see
immediate
certification
to
start
selling
the
gas
because
remember,
in
these
same
wells,
gas
is
being
sold
at
trunkline
gas
company,
and
we're
being
drained
to
that
extent.
natural
gas
pipe
isn't
going
to
get
the
gas.
so
we
ask
for
the
temporaries
and
now
went
to
the
ci
dockets.
now,
the
commission
gives
us
our
temporary,
it
says
18
cents.
in
the
intervening
period,
we'd
have
the
statement
of
general
policy
which
certain
guideline
rates
and
which
the
commission
would
govern
itself
in
conditioning
initially
without
a
--
or
certificating
without
an
initial
price
condition
if
the
price
were
below.
and
in
the
case
of
rate
increase
filings,
if
it
is
above,
they
would
suspend,
if
it
was
below,
they
wouldn't
suspend.
in
the
intervening
period
between
the
g
dockets,
the
time
that
gas
was
on
the
screen
on
the
permanent
certificated
--
certificates
in
the
ci
dockets,
the
statement
of
general
policy
came
down,
so
the
commission
gave
us
a
temporary
at
18
cents
but
we
couldn't
understand
it.
we
could
understand
why
they
would
do
it
under
the
statement
of
general
policy
but
where
the
same
producers
--
the
same
producers
from
the
same
wells
in
many
cases,
in
the
same
field
were
selling
gas
at
20
cents.
oh
it's
triggering,
how
could
there
be
any
triggering?
if
there
was
any
triggering
that
occurred
with
respect
to
the
g
dockets,
it
couldn't,
with
respect
to
ours.
one
of
the
very
nature
of
the
favor
nations,
there
isn't
any
new
pipeline,
purchasing
gas
at
a
higher
price.
as
for
redetermination,
that
would
have
occurred
in
the
same
way.
as
far
as
i
know,
i
don't'
understand
the
general
counsel
to
state
that
there
has
been
any
redeterminations
as
a
result
of
this,
but
in
any
event,
we
sought
rehearing,
we
said
it's
unreasonable.
now,
one
thing
i'd
like
to
make
very
clear
and
i
think
we
have,
and
the
court
below
recognized
it.
respondents
here
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
commission
in
keeping
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
in
catco
to
impose
initial
price
conditions.
but
we
say
that
a
condition
must
be
reasonable
and
the
circumstances
must
warrant
it.
here,
we
thought
they
didn't.
we
sought
rehearing,
rehearing
was
denied.
we
proposed,
based
on
a
number
of
recent
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
citing
the
nature
of
the
commission's
regulatory
powers
under
4,
5
and
7,
that
if
they
were
going
to
condition
the
price
down
would
give
us
as
in
the
alternatives
suggested
in
catco,
a
1-day
suspension,
we
actually
said
a
30-day
suspension
to
take
care
of
the
statutory
30-day
notice.
well,
this
is
what
we
came
out
and
we
finally
did.
we
said,
"let
us
collect
it
and
we'll
agree
to
refund
it
with
7%
interest."
commission
says
no.
not
only,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
that
but
you
can't
proceed
under
section
4
where
the
same
thing
would
occur.
we
would
give
30
days
notice,
we'll
put
it
into
effect
and
--
and
depending
however
many
years,
intervening
period
why
we
would
collect
it,
subject
fully
to
refund
under
section
4
pending
the
determination
under
other
section
or
section
7
or
4.
under
7,
whether
the
price
was
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
or
the
sale
at
that
price
or
under
section
4
whether
it
was
just
and
reasonable,
because
absent
the
right
to
do
this.
this
is
our
remedy
to
protect
ourselves
as
it
--
as
justice
clark
said
in
catco
and
that
justice
brennan
the
next
year,
emphasized
in
sunray
mid-continent,
unless
we
can
do
this.
what
is
going
to
happen
to
us
if
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
on
the
permanent,
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
will
fall
in
1961
and
we
still
don't
have
a
permanent
certificate
and
we're
still
operating
under
the
provision.
true,
we
asked
to
have
the
ci
dockets
deconsolidated
from
the
g
dockets,
and
we
had
a
very
good
reason
for
that
which
i
will
come
to.
but
we're
still
operating
on
this.
now,
suppose
that
the
--
when
we
finally
do
get
the
certificate
or
in
some
subsequent
area
rate
proceeding
under
section
5,
the
commission's
rate
power
is
being
prospective
only.
what
happens
to
us
after
--
if
the
commission
says,
"my
gosh!
you
were
right
all
along.
we've
lost
it.
there's
not
a
way
and
to
where
we
can
get
it
back.
this
is
a
wasting
asset."
and
around
eight
years,
most
of
the
gas
involved
here
is
going
to
be
gone.
now,
i
say
eight
years
because
--
let's
get
back
to
the
g
dockets.
we
had
our
hearing
after
the
new
york
commission
was
allowed
to
come
in.
new
york
commission
did
not
offer
any
evidence,
didn't
--
say
all
they
said
was,
"the
price
was
too
high
in
the
area."
so
we
said,
"alright,
we'll
introduce
evidence.
what
sort
of
evidence
should
we
introduce?"
the
commission
said,
"that
is
for
us
to
know
and
you
to
find
out.
all
we
will
assure
you
is,
you
have
the
widest
latitude."
we'd
said,
"should
we
do
it
on
individual
cost
basis,
shall
we
do
it
in
the
individual
economics
of
the
particular
producing
area
or
shall
we
do
it
for
the
whole
area?"
the
commission
says,
"do
it
anyway
you
want."
so
we
put
in
a
very
large
case
on
--
in
every
way
we
could
figure
that
was
thrown
out.
and
what
we
did
was
to
go
on
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
inline
doctrine.
now,
with
all
respect
to
justice
clark
and
certainly
to
the
court,
there
had
been
more
things
said
and
done
in
the
name
of
inline.
it
says
1959
that
i
--
than
any
producer,
believe
me,
he
has
to
think
about.
it
has
become
a
virtual
cult.
the
way
we
determine
whether
a
sale
is
required
for
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
at
a
particular
price,
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
court
said,
"you
don't
have
to
make
a
rate
case
out
of
it,"
that's
alright
with
us,
that
cost
to
put
it
in
a
rate
case.
but
what
we
do
is
to
take
all
of
the
contracts
executed
in
the
year
in
which
you
executed
your
contract,
where
three
years
later
in
a
hearing,
let's
take
them
and
that
indicates
if
you
are
willing
at
that
time
to
contract.
alright,
we
will
automatically
take
all
those
contracts
and
those
which
are
not
--
are
not
the
subject
of
permanent
certification,
get
rid
of
them,
put
them
to
one
side.
any
that
have
been
subject
to
court
review,
propose
to
one
side,
even
though
there
has
been
no
evidence
and
no
hearing.
and
then
any
other
price
that
looks
like
a
price
to
which
somebody
has
said,
"we
don't
think
it's
in
the
public
interest."
they
put
that
aside.
so
we
eventually
get
this
thing
down
to
something
that
is
back
around
19
--
somewhere
between
1954
and
1960.
now,
the
producers
have
argued
that
this,
the
sales
to
take
into
account,
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
important."
gas
moving
today
in
substantial
quantities,
what's
the
price?"
but
more
importantly,
in
catco,
the
court
expressed
surprise
that
if
there
had
been
evidence
available
of
deeper
drilling
cost,
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
it
wasn't
offered.
the
commission
today
would
not
look
at
it.
they
simply
takeaway
the
average
and
they
say,
"this
is
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
price,
here
is
your
permanent
certificate."
what
have
we
got
then?
they
may
reduce
our
price
to
be
sure
but
what
have
we
got
then,
we
didn't
have
when
we
started
on
the
temporary?
we
can't
stop
and
the
commission
has
never
refused
to
grant
a
permanent,
after
having
once
permitted
the
sale
to
begin
under
a
temporary.
never.
it
has
taken
the
position,
we
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
so
absent,
the
producer
coming
and
filling
application
under
section
7
(b)
of
the
act
to
abandon
it
which
conceivably
would
be
opposed
by
pipeline.
and
who
is
to
say,
the
commission
would
say,
"we
--
we
figure
you're
right.
the
gas
isn't
needed."
when
the
pipeline
initially,
has
said,
"the
gas
is
needed."
the
pipelines
are
market.
what
market
showing
do
we
make?
we
come
in
with
the
contract
that
indicates
the
pipeline
needs
the
gas.
the
only
question
in
an
initial
certification
for
producer
sale
is
the
question
of
initial
price
to
date.
that
is
the
only
question.
now,
the
commission,
interestingly
enough
in
this
case,
i
think
has
more
or
less
abandoned
its
original
argument.
certainly
--
it
doesn't
press
it
with
the
same
vigor
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
temporary
producer
and
a
permanent
producer.
they
can't
very
well
say
that
he
isn't
subject
to
all
the
same
restraints
and
duties
and
obligations
of
the
act,
he
is.
he
can't
abandon.
he
has
to
give
notice
anytime
he
wants
to
increase
his
price.
he
can
be
told
virtually
what
to
do,
when
to
do
it.
there
he
is.
now,
what
the
commission
has
shifted
to
now
is,
that
embarked
as
they
are
on
area
rate
making,
in
the
area
of
approach
that
at
least
with
respect
to
all
new
certificated
sales,
they're
going
to
stop
a
moratorium,
and
they
say
it
was
specified
period
of
time
until
in
the
case
of
south
louisiana,
i
think
it's
still
1967
or
the
conclusion
of
the
south
louisiana
area
proceeding,
whichever
is
earlier.
they
have
monday
of
last
week,
a
week
ago
today,
imposed
now
a
moratorium
on
the
texas
gulf
coast
saying,
"until
the
conclusion
of
a
recently
instituted
proceeding,
ar
642
or
until
january
1,
1968,
you
can't
increase
the
price
above
19
cents.
this
still
isn't
the
20
cents."
you
can't
fall
for
it.
we're
just
going
to
reject
it.
here's
your
certificate.
we
can't
reject
that
certificate,
your
honors.
we
have
the
right
to
reject
the
initial
certificate
they
gave
us
back
in
1960.
we
could
have
elected
not
to
start
our
sale
because
the
new
york
commission
was
clamoring
to
be
permitted
to
intervene,
and
it
had
a
right
to
intervene,
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
were
we
to
hold
off
for
a
full
year
and
a
half,
the
completion
of
judicial
review
and
the
people
of
chicago,
chicago
--
we
understand
from
natural
gas
pipeline
needed
that
gas,
we
had
to
sell
it
for
we
to
hold
off,
and
now,
since
we
can't
abandon,
the
commission
can
declare
a
moratorium.
now,
really
let's
get
down
to
what
the
reasonableness.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
still
january
1,
1968.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
a
year,
two
years,
three
years,
four
years.
the
commission
--
the
members
of
the
commission
fired
men
no
matter
how
sincerely
dedicated
and
desires
of
--
of
--
carrying
out
the
mandate
of
the
court
in
catco,
the
general
purposes
of
the
act.
they
are
only
men,
and
they
may
not
be
in
office
five
years
from
now.
now,
what
is
to
say
if
it
--
and
proceeding
has
not
been
concluded
and
these
proceedings
are
monstrous,
large.
what
is
to
say
to
prevent
them
from
saying,
"we
have
determined
that
we
better
go
for
another
four
years
or
two
more
years,
find
out
for
the
life
of
the
contract,
what
happens
to
the
contract
incidentally?
we
have
to
file
a
contract
you
know,"
and
i
say
we,
producers.
the
produce
--
i'd
like
to
see
what
would
happen
frankly
if
a
producer
came
in
with
a
tariff.
he
can't
file
a
tariff,
pipelines
file
tariffs.
a
pipeline
can
file
tomorrow
for
whatever
it
wants.
the
commission
sets
a
time
for
hearing.
the
same
court,
in
alabama
tennessee
that
they
rely
on,
and
mississippi
river
fuel
said,
"there
wasn't
a
color
of
statutory
authority,
looking
at
the
commission's
action
and
rejecting
a
pipeline
rate-filing."
and
incidentally,
this
is
interesting
to
me,
the
commission
has
not
relied
on
the
broad
powers
of
section
16
of
the
act,
which
gives
it
the
authority
to
issue
all
orders
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
other
purposes
of
the
act.
it
hasn't
relied
on
it
and
i
suspect
principally,
because
wilmette,
the
wilmette
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
this
court
denied
certiorari,
said
section
16,
with
all
its
broad
grant,
would
not
give
the
authority
to
reject
a
rate-filling,
citing
this
case
in
this
court's
decision
in
mobile.
now,
what
is
the
answer?
the
commission
doesn't
need
the
powers
it's
contending
for,
it
doesn't
need
them
in
case
of
permanent
certification
of
a
producer
sale,
nor
doesn't
it
need
in
connection
with
the
area
rate
making.
where
a
producer,
and
there'd
been
darn
few
of
them
have
filed,
caroline
hunt
sands
is
one.
incidentally,
she
only
asked
for
a
contract,
she
doesn't
ask
for
33
cents.
she
can't,
under
mobile.
alright,
darn
few
of
these
people
have
filed
and
when
they
file,
what
happens?
the
commission
sets
them
down
for
hearing
on
an
individual
company-cost
basis.
it
handled
--
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
summer
of
1962
or
1963
--
1962,
it
handled
nine
of
these
in
four
days,
with
every
conceivable
type
of
cost
evidence
put
in,
it
was
all
excluded
because
it
didn't
conform
the
phillips.
now,
caroline
hunt
sands
is
not
phillips
petroleum
company.
so
the
commission
throws
it
out
and
they
said,
"we
beat
the
magic
deadline
that
they
could've
putted
into
effect."
but
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
is
not
without
power
to
devise
means
of
holding
a
hearing
and
basing
it
on
some
standards.
the
commission
has
yet
to
adopt
really
any
standards
at
all,
either
on
individualized
cost
basis,
replacement
cost.
we're
not
on
traditional
cost
of
service
necessarily.
the
point
is,
we're
dealing
under
an
act
which
recognizes
and
hope
it
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
balancing
of
the
consumer
in
the
investment
interest.
now,
when
you
takeaway
the
one
reservation,
really
of
right
to
a
producer,
the
producer
doesn't
get
anything
out
of
being
regulated
as
a
natural
gas
company,
not
today
that
he
hasn't.
is
he
supposed
to?
i
agree,
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
protect
the
consumer
but
the
consumer
has
an
interest
in
the
continued
supply
of
gas.
now,
if
you're
going
to
take
out
the
one
thing
section
4,
which
is
the
right
to
protect
himself,
and
make
it
completely
up
to
the
commission
as
to
when
he
can
be
reinstated
to
his
statutory
rights,
you
give
the
--
that
power
of
a
legislative
discretion
which
the
fifth
circuit
described
as
awesome
to
put
it
in
their
hands.
now,
cab
versus
delta
airlines
was
pretty
bad,
we
think
in
reading
it,
but
this
is
10
times
more
egregious.
there,
they
simply
didn't
follow
the
procedures
outline.
here,
they're
writing
out
part
of
the
act.
i'm
watching
it
a
little
bit
emotional
perhaps
but
i've
lived
with
this
case
for
about
since
1959
and
it
looks
now,
if
we've
got
a
moratorium
until
1968
that
if
the
gas
gives
out,
i
think
if
i'm
still
retained,
i
won't
have
anything
there.
but
all
we
ask
for
to
get
the
thing
back
in
focus
is
the
statutory
right
to
give
notice
to
the
commission
that
our
contract
price
is
going
to
go
up
in
accordance
with
its
terms
on
a
certain
date.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i'm
--
justice
black,
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that
question.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
first
of
all,
there
is
not
a
pipeline
in
the
united
states
that
is
going
to
buy,
contract
for
gas
at
50
cents
secondly,
the
commission
has
a
perfect
right
to
deny
us
a
certificate
if
we
come
in
with
that
price.
but
just
because
they
can
deny
a
certificate,
it
doesn't
mean
--
we
want
to
be
careful
when
we
say
this.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
do
it
simply
because
the
price
is
too
high.
considering
all
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
such
as
continued
gas
supply,
inspire
these
new
suppliers
and
so
forth.
it
has,
we
feel,
a
duty
to
say,
"50
cents,
we'll
deny
it
unless
you
take
it
at
the
guideline
area
price.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
our
condition.
it
must
--
i
think
it
would
be
obligated
to
offer
us
a
condition
when
--
before
it
denied
it
out
of
hand.
now,
what
is
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
today
just
to
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
if
we
accepted
the
condition,
we
accepted
it
but
we
do
not
accept
with
that
condition
a
total
conditioning
out
of
any
future
increase
in
price.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
question
justice
goldberg.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
right.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
in
this
particular
case,
we
came
in
for
20,
they
said,
"well,
i
won't
give
it
to
you
20,
you
take
of
18
or
don't
take
it
at
all.
we'd
like
you
to
take
it
at
18."
we
complained
because
we
said,
"suppose
you
later
find
20
at
the
conclusion
of
this
hearing
on
the
permanent,
and
incidentally,
you
know
they
don't
at
anything
at
a
permanent,
they
don't
look
at
any
of
this
evidence
on
anymore."
"in
case
you
do,
we're
out
of
luck,
but
alright,
in
the
alternative,
let
us
then
proceed
under
section
4,"
and
either
case
we
agreed
to
refund
it.
now,
as
to
the
future
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
right.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
right.
they
can't.
we
don't
determine
anything.
this
is
a
temporary
situation
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
that
is
to
begin
ourselves
under
emergency
authorization.
they
--
the
condition
says,
"pending,
the
holding
of
a
hearing
on
a
permanent
certificate
until
we
decide
whether
you
should
be
given
a
permanent
certificate."
well,
i
pointed
out
that
you're
going
to
get
one
whether
you
want
it
or
not
at
least
you're
not
going
to
be
told
to
turn
the
gas
off.
alright,
but
what
do
they
do
today,
justice
black,
they
don't
do
anything
more
than
the
same
thing
they
do
when
they
grant
you
the
temporary
average
up,
it
looks
like
the
fair
--
fair
fuel
price,
the
going
price,
that's
all
the
commission
does.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
on
the
permanent.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
a
permanent
and
not
a
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
under
--
under
a
certificate
case
--
in
a
certificate
case
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
all
rates
are
--
are
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
now,
until
there
can
be
that
determination,
until
there
is
that
determination,
something
must
be
charged.
now,
pipelines,
base
--
rely
on
alabama-tennessee,
it
filed
what
it
proposed.
it's
initial,
in
effect
contract
price,
it's
a
--
initial
tariff
priceq.
it
proposed,
but
the
commission
didn't
fix
it.
it
asked
for
a
condition
that
it
keep
it
in
effect.
as
a
producer,
we
have
only
our
initial
contract
price.
the
commission
tells
us
to
reduce
it
or
you
can't
start
selling.
now,
in
catco,
you
found
this
was
not
an
encroachment
on
our
initial
--
so
you
found
you
couldn't
--
they
can't
suspend
that
initial
price,
but
this
wasn't
an
encroachment
or
a
right
to
make
and
change
our
rates.
in
accordance
with
the
act,
once
we
had
started
our
sale
at
the
lower
conditioned
price.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
in
accordance
with
their
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
that
--
no.
the
thing
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
won't
let
us.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
won't
let
us.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
the
court
below.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
--
they
fixed
the
temporary
rate
sir.
there's
no
difference
in
effect
between
the
temporary
and
the
permanent
rate.
the
commission
doesn't
do
the
things
it
says
at
a
hearing
on
a
permanent
that
they
suggest
in
their
brief.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
now
--
that
condition
should
read,
this
18-cent
price
shall
remain
in
effect
until
such
time
as
the
commission
fixes
a
just
and
reasonable
area
rate
for
producers.
now,
that's
--
that's
what
the
commission
is
now
proposing
at
page
26
and
27
of
our
brief.
the
things
they
don't
look
at,
they
say
this
is
awaiting
the
determination
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
but
when
is
that
going
to
be
and
quite
apart
from
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
can't
fix
it.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
question
whether
i'd
ever
be
permitted
to
fix
--
increase
the
price.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
fictitious
but
i
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
yes,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
fictitious
when
i
say
that
i
--
i
--
that
as
far
as
a
permanent
effective
bond
of
protection,
i
can
think
of
no
more
permanent
effective
bond
of
protection
than
that
the
prices
never
be
increased
by
any
producer
once
he
starts
selling
his
gas
at
the
price
that
the
commission
says
he
can.
now
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
idea
that's
being
advanced
here.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
say
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
they
say
it's
a
matter
of
degree
and
--
and
there's
--
and
there's
opinion
below,
judge
brown
says
that
this
--
that
--
that
what
this
means,
this
condition
is
that
the
prices,
the
rates
are
(a)
those
fixed
by
the
commission
in
the
first
place
when
you
start,
either
under
temporary
or
permanent
which
are
to
continue
until
(b),
the
commission
itself
fixes
another
level.
you
can't
propose
rates,
the
fact
the
commission
says,
"you
got
to
wait
a
couple
of
years
before
you
can
do
it
again
or
you
can
only
go
up
to
such
a
level."
it's
only
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
suppose
they
said
it
for
the
life
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
assuming
--
assuming
my
contract
said
that
i
could
raise
it
to
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
--
30
--
however
many
years,
the
contract
said
--
now,
suppose
i
were
pipeline
though,
now
i
--
my
--
my
tariff
wouldn't
say
anything
like
that.
i
could
file
the
next
day.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
my
contract
is
for
a
fixed
time
of
years
and
it
covers
a
contemplated
gas
reserve
which
is
being
sold,
constantly
being
sold.
now,
i
don't
know
any
more
than
the
commission
knows
your
honor,
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
going
to
be.
if
my
price
is
above
it,
i'll
have
to
refund
presumably.
but
suppose
my
price
is
below
it
and
yet
still
higher
than
this
initial
price
to
which
i
started
service.
at
least
to
that
extent,
i
will
have
achieved
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
i
believe
that
a
producer
is
entitled
for
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
just
as
much
as
a
consumer,
for
the
consumer's
interest
as
a
matter
of
fact.
if
unless
i
have
the
protection
of
being
able
to
proceed
under
section
4,
i
will
have
lost
this
irrevocably.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
do
you
mean
under
section
7
of
the
act
when
they
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
--
when
i
came
in
for
temporary
certificate
and
not
as
if
you
can
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
that
was
a
--
the
gist
of
our
complaint
below
but
we
lost
on
that.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
"we're
not
going
to
question
the
commission
in
the
type
of
initial
price
condition
reducing
the
price,
whether
they
let
you
do
it
under
section
7
or
section
4,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
because
in
other
case,
you're
willing
to
do
it
subject
to
refund.
it's
dealer's
choice.
they
chose
not
to
let
us
do
it
under
section
7.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
on
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no,
the
consumers
will
get
the
--
will
get
the
protection
of
refunds
with
interest
of
7%
which
what
the
commission
is
now
proposing
will
not
provide
them.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
think
perhaps
it
is,
and
what
it
is,
justice
black
is
the
inherent
nature
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no,
that
is
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
my
whole
objection
is,
they
wouldn't
let
us
even
do
that
and
we
say
that
the
statute
gives
the
natural
gas
company
that
right.
in
mobile,
the
court
said
unequivocally
that
the
rights
to
make
and
change
rates
are
to
be
no
different,
were
intended
to
be
no
different
from
what
they
were
if
the
act
had
never
been
passed,
save
only
to
the
fact
that
you
must
file
your
rate,
the
tariff
on
file
and
you
must
let
the
commission
know
every
time
you
propose
to
increase
your
rate
if
your
contract
permits
you
to
increase
your
rate.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
to
nullify
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no,
i'm
--
i
--
i
won't
--
i
won't
narrow
it
that.
we're
willing
to
make
the
refund.
i
simply
say
that
after
all
your
honor,
the
commission
might
accept
the
filing
under
section
4
and
not
suspend
it
under
4
(e),
that's
for
the
commission
to
decide.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
there
--
well,
i
would
not
tie
it
in
to
this
question
of
maintaining
the
fund.
we're
willing
to
do
it
if
it's
suspended
so
if
the
commission
orders
us
to
do
that,
we're
--
we're
willing
to
file
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
we're
willing
to
do
that.
what
i'm
objecting
to
is
that
the
commission
has
removed
section
4
from
the
act,
insofar
as
we're
concerned
and
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
though
it
wasn't
squarely
before
them.
if
they
can
write
out
section
4
in
its
availability
to
the
natural
gas
company,
why
not
write
out
section
19
which
makes
judicial
review
available
and
that
the
commission
had
a
condition,
it's
certainly
softened
it
--
certainly
softened
it
since
this
case.
well,
they
said
if
you
seek
judicial
review,
if
you
seek
rehearing
or
further
review
of
the
--
of
the
conditions,
this
authorization
dissolves
in
thin
air
if
you
will,
but
all
the
conditions
remain
on
you,
so
we
don't
have
a
certificate.
presumably,
we're
in
violation
of
the
act
because
we're
still
selling
gas,
of
course
we
can't
turn
it
off
and
they'd
probably
never
prosecute
us.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
the
rate
before
the
--
the
change
in
what,
in
the
--
here?
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
oh,
we
have
no
increase
here.
we
--
we
want
it
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
which
is
the
initial
contract
price,
that's
what
we
originally
proposed,
that
was
our
initial
rate.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
that's
--
that's
the
contract
price,
it's
a
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
the
difference
was
in
the
escalation.
now,
in
that
difference
in
escalation
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
oh,
the
escalated
price
in
the
future.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
look
at
the
act
and
construe
it
as
--
as
we
read
the
court's
decisions,
the
time
for
the
commission
to
worry
about
any
increase
is
when
the
producer
comes
in
and
asked
for
the
increase
and
the
commission
has
full
power.
now,
the
commission
may
not
like
as
it
says
in
its
brief,
a
contract
where
the
price
jumps,
say
from
5
cents
to
20
cents
the
next
year.
but
under
the
act
and
we're
operating
under
the
act,
at
least
we
were,
i
thought
in
these
procedures,
the
commission
has
suspend
it
and
holds
a
hearing.
they've
demonstrated
that
they
can
hold
a
hearing.
but
quite
beyond
that,
let's
face
the
realities,
the
probables
have
been
--
really,
were
paraded
by
the
commission
in
this
thing
because
there
hasn't
been
any
wave
of
triggering.
there
are
majors
today
--
major
producers
who
have
purposely
not
filed
and
they're
not
going
to
file
until
this
thing
shakes
down,
7%
interest,
it's
rather
big.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no
--
no.
oh
no.
there
are
already
prices
above
it
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
and
the
commission
attaches
no
validity
whatsoever
to
that
area
of
price
other
than
as
a
benchmark
to
guide
it
in
determining
whether
the
condition,
people
like
respondents
at
18
cents
or
below
and
they've
since
dropped
it
some
more
based
again
on
a
reevaluation
that
we
know
not
what.
it
isn't
for
real.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
permanent
certificates
are
issued
now
--
at
the
page
27,
the
decision
of
examiner
western.
now,
i
realize
that
it's
an
examiner's
decision
but
it's
the
largest
single
producer
certificate
case
ever
to
come
before
the
commission.
it's
all
at
south
louisiana,
every
new
sale
down
there.
and
the
examiner
says,
"our
main
interest
and
following
the
directions
to
halt
rather
than
follow
the
trend
of
the
market
and
to
readopt
the
method
of
concentrating
on
certifications
which
do
not
express
erroneous
principles
of
pricing
policies."
of
course,
he
admits,
he
says,
"of
course,
the
method
is
circular
and
that
present
commission
action
is
judged
solely
by
measuring
it
against
past
commission
action,"
and
so,
this
would
be
a
valid
objection.
he
said,
"but
we're
not
here,
we
are
freezing
prices
here
until
the
conclusion
of
the
southern
louisiana
area
proceeding
is
no
longer
since
we're
involved
with
a
temporary
expedient
--
temporary
which
gives
no
consideration
the
value
of
gas
service,
reasonable
return
or
other
aspects
of
fair
and
reasonable
rates."
and
this
is
the
thing
i
can't
believe
the
court
said
in
catco.
the
open
markets
only
relevance
is
that
it
signals
the
existence
of
the
situation
that
probably
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest,
speaking
of
any
of
--
citing
catco,
speaking
of
any
applications
reflecting
the
market.
now,
the
market
has
a
meaning.
it
doesn't
necessarily
reflect
the
situation
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission
uses
the
market
itself
to
determine
inland
prices.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
can
i
ask
you
two
questions
about
the
way
of
answer?
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
suppose
the
commission
subsequently
determined
that
the
price
is
just
and
reasonable,
but
it
does
not
allow
you
to
collect
it
subject
to
refund,
in
which
case
you've
lost
it.
suppose
the
difference
of
a
penny
which
can
make
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
a
producer,
remember,
$2000
a
day
and
more
to
have
one
drilling
rig
out.
the
difference
of
one
penny,
suppose
the
commission
at
the
conclusion
four
or
five
years
down
the
road
says,
by
george,
"it
was
1
penny
more
all
the
time,
but
we
can't
make
you
hold
again,
would
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
all
we're
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i'm
--
well,
i
understand
that
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
understand
that
sir.
and
then
the
second
question
is
this.
what
if
the
commission
has
the
power
to
do
what
was
condemned
by
the
fifth
circuit,
what
is
to
prevent
it
from
saying,
"18
cents,
14
cents,
10
cents,
in
west
virginia
26
cents"
for
the
life
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
and
you
started
your
sale
without
any
contemplation
if
that
was
going
to
be
the
situation.
they
had
told
you,
"only
until
we
decide
the
permanent
certificate
or
only
until
we
have
this
area
of
proceeding."
in
short,
that
you
start
off
at
something
less
than
your
contract,
you're
required
to
file
your
contract
but
you'll
later
find
out
it
means
nothing
because
you're
stuck
there
forever.
you
do
not
have
the
right.
if
we're
natural
gas
companies,
as
our
pipelines
and
that
section
4
means
what
--
we
think
it
says
and
what
the
court
said
in
mobile,
that
would
be
unreasonable,
that
would
be
violative
of
the
right
reserved
to
natural
gas
companies
by
congress.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
justice
clark,
i've
got
to
say
that
until
that
happens,
the
commission
can
be
cognizant
about
it,
but
if
the
producer
files
for
it,
somebody
is
contractive
with
them
on
that
basis.
the
commission
suspends
it
and
they
hold
a
hearing
under
section
5
of
the
act
and
they
fix
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
having
done
that,
we've
got
a
third
circuit
case,
the
panhandle
eastern
filed
immediately
after
having
a
total
number
of
items
disallowed
on
its
cost
of
service
who
came
right
back
in
and
filed
immediately
to
the
things
that
had
been
disallowed
and
the
third
circuit
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
rate-increase
application.
there
hadn't
been
an
adequate
period
of
time
for
cost
to
go
up.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
of
every
state
gas?
wildcat
drilling
has
been
down.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no,
no.
that's
the
cost
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
--
of
this
little
producer
who
will
never
achieve
those
costs
in
all
likelihood
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
not
even
enter
in
her
contract.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
doubt
sir,
so
you
know
the
pipeline
would
not
enter
in
their
contract
with
it
today.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
she
hasn't
tried
to.
she's
committed
to
the
sale.
she
isn't
seeking
to
abandon.
all
she's
coming
with
is
a
periodic
escalation,
if
you
will,
increase
that's
been
set
for
hearing.
the
commission
is
going
to
determine
whether
it's
just
and
reasonable.
all
she's
asking
for
is
something
--
i
--
i
forgot
the
exact
level
--
less
than
33
and
she
may
not
get
that.
but
remember,
let
--
let's
say
it
was
23
cents,
is
the
price
she's
asking
for.
what
was
our
last
price,
20
cents
so
she
just
--
from
20
to
23,
the
commission
recognizes,
perhaps
if
he
has
cost
of
33
cents.
even
if
they
fit,
they
can't
give
a
33
cents.
she's
still
only
going
to
23
and
she
might
get
a
little
bit
less
than
that.
but
certainly,
she
might
get
more
than
10
cents
but
how
can
she
do
it,
unless
she
can
file
under
section
4
(e),
she
can't.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
now,
we
have
to
take
this
position,
your
honors
that
if
the
act
says
that
all
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
and
if
in
wisconsin,
last
term,
at
the
court,
the
majority
said
that,
"we
assume
that
the
area
price
if
only
arrive
at
will
not
be
so
high
as
to
deprive
consumers
nor
so
low
as
to
deprive
producers
of
their
right
to
adjust
and
reasonable
price.
we
take
the
position
that
this
until
something
else
comes
along,
and
i
think
we'll
probably
still
take
it
that
any
price
that
is
less
than
just
and
reasonable
is
within
the
framework
of
this
act,
confiscatory.
now,
we're
not
wedded
to
rate-based
cost
of
service
traditional.
the
court
said
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
pursue
that,
it
can
try
new
things.
but
whatever
they
try,
it
has
got
to
related
at
some
point
to
cost,
maybe
it's
a
replacement
of
gas
cost,
maybe
it's
a
recognition
if
the
average
producers
are
going
to
spend
so
much
as
getting
stuff
out
of
the
ground,
he's
got
to
pay
for
his
leases
and
so
fort.
but
whatever
it
is,
the
individual
must
eventually
have
the
right
to
say,
"you
faced
me
with
a
terrible
alternative
because
i
am
getting
by
your
own
definition
less
than
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
i'd
like
to
show
you
that
i'm
losing
my
share."
now,
if
i
have
to
sell
out
and
get
out
of
the
business,
assuming
i
can
find
a
buyer,
not
a
dime
on
the
dollar,
and
assuming
you'll
let
me
get
out
of
the
business,
i've
still
had
a
taking
at
my
property
because
you
yourself,
the
commissioner
said,
"this
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
anything
less
than
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
we
feel
must
be
a
confiscatory
rate."
beyond
that
i
have
no
thoughts
or
philosophy
with
respect
to
area
rate
making
other
than
its
--
taking
a
very
long
time,
much
longer
and
much
more
thought
with
more
interesting
things
and
you
can
imagine,
we
have
econometricians
that
devise
models
and
to
have
aggression
equations.
econometricians,
that's
a
new
science.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
the
economet
--
econometrics
is
the
science.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
econometrics.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
it's
--
it's
new
--
so
new
that
--
that
one
little
tiny
factor,
the
thing
of
key
here
will
just
--
i
mean
millions
of
dollars,
one
way
or
the
other.
they've
got
something
else
that's
interesting.
there
is
something
called
directionality
now.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
directionality.
large
producers
claim
and
maintain
that
the
science
has
gotten
to
the
point
that
they
can
go
out
and
look
for
gas
and
supposed
oil.
and
they've
got
some
statistics
on
these
items.
it
was
proved
that
they
can
look
for
gas
instead
of
oil.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
no.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
but
they're
not
going
to
go
looking
for
gas
necessarily
unless
they
think
they're
going
to
get
a
return
point,
and
i
might
if
i
can
when
--
as
my
ipse
dixit.
but
if
philips
petroleum
company's
income
in
1954
was
only
6%
derived
from
jurisdictional
sales,
it
was
low
then
and
it
certainly
not
represented
of
the
majors.
when
you
get
down
to
the
independent,
the
small
fellow,
he
can
run
up
to
50%
to
60%
of
his
income
from
jurisdictional
gas
sales.
and
one
of
the
majors,
i
understand,
i
won't
mention
them
because
i
don't
have.
this
is
30%
of
its
income
today
comes
from
jurisdictional
gas
sales.
so
if
the
overall
purposes
of
the
act
are
to
be
achieved
by
the
commission
in
area
rate
making,
we
feel
that
it's
got
to
be
done
under
the
act
and
that
is
consistent
with
every
statement
this
court
has
made
in
dealing
with
these
problems
that
have
come
up
from
administrative
agencies
and
that
in
so
doing,
in
the
interest
of
administrative
convenience,
purely
and
simply,
the
commission
cannot
write
out
and
--
and
fail
to
recognize
rights
reserved
specifically
under
one
section
of
the
act
in
the
interest
to
carry
out
the
overall
purpose
of
the
act.
thank
you,
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
