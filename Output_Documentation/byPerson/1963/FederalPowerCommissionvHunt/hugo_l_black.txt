condition.
justice

but
you
accepted
the
condition.
justice

black
(inaudible)
but
justice
goldberg
--
and
as
i
understood
catco,
when
they
heard
and
held
at
1970,
i
believe
it
was,
gave
the
right
to
attach
conditions
and
that
they
could
investigate
and
fix
the
rate
below
that
which
was
clear
and
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
had
accepted
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
--
because
i'm
(inaudible)
in
this
field,
but
i
have
an
idea
that
it
takes
a
long
time
to
have
a
thorough
going
investigation
with
reference
to
cause,
investments,
and
so
forth
before
you
can
fix
a
permanent
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
a
rate
fixed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
when
you
go
to
fixed
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
the
difference
between
you
is
this,
you
say
and
believe
unquestionably,
that's
an
awesome
power
to
give
the
commission
to
hold
your
rate
as
it
does
temporarily
after
you
fixed
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
way
they
have
done
and
that
it's
barred
by
four
liaisons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
have
a
right
to
fix
rates
yourself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
take
the
position
seemingly,
that's
an
awesome
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
--
or
the
producer
to
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
fix
any
rate
he
sees
fit
which
might
be
50
cents
or
that
someway
for
the
commission
to
look
at
it
to
fix
some
kind
of
a
temporary
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
--
suppose
they
fixed
it
permanently
at
20
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
long
would
--
well,
suppose
they
did
fix
it
and
approve
your
rate
to
fix
it
at
20
and
you
wanted
to
change
it,
how
long
would
you
have
to
wait
about
increasing
the
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
permanent
with
perpetual
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
new
idea
but
it
deal
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
construe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
construed
the
act,
if
your
20-cent
rate
had
been
accepted
without
this
--
with
any
hesitancy
at
all
then
put
in
effect.
as
you
construe
the
act,
how
long
could
you
have
raised
it
at
the
table?
it's
presented
a
news
--
new
ways.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
contract
has
not
been
permanent,
it
has
not
been
in
perpetuity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
fixed
in
their
order
provision,
i
--
i
want
to
see
if
this
is
the
only
difference
between
you,
follow
refund
later
on,
and
had
provided
for
refund
to
be
collected
in
the
court
--
collected
by
the
court
until
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
you
then
still
have
an
objection
to
what
they've
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
order
--
order
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
provided
that
hereafter,
if
you
could
determine
that
the
rate
was
not
just
and
reasonable
permanently,
that
you
should
refund
that
and
you
should
give
a
list
and
have
a
list
of
all
their
purchases
in
consumers
ready
to
pay
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that
put
into
to
fund.
is
it
my
understanding
that
that
is
the
gist
of
your
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
claiming
then
here,
the
right
to
fix
the
rate
so
that
if
the
expiration
of
five
months,
that
rate
goes
into
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
if
consumers
are
later,
if
it's
later
determined,
if
consumers
had
paid
too
much,
they
can't
get
it
back,
is
that
your
argument
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
i
was
asking
was,
is
that
a
crucial
thing
in
your
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
order
provide
--
if
the
order
expires
your
concern,
i
listened
to
both
arguments
to
see
if
that
was
it.
as
far
as
your
concern,
if
the
order
had
said
this
rate
is
too
high,
we're
not
going
to
put
it
in
effects
here
permanently
now,
we're
going
to
reduce
it
to
18
cents.
but
in
the
mean
time,
the
company
has
got
to
set
aside
a
fund
which
was
be
adhesively
available
to
consumers
to
get
their
money
back,
then
would
you
have
any
complain
against
the
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
in
other
words,
is
that
your
whole
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
then
is
that
the
commission
is
without
power
to
do
what
it
has
done
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
only
if
it
failed
to
provide
for
refund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
objection
beyond
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
five
months
now,
the
five
months
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
rate
before
the
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
--
this
case
--
this
increase
you
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
fixing
--
you're
fixing
it
at
20
cents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you
have
any
rate
before
you
propose
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
20
cents,
you
know
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
difference
was
in
the
escalation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
price
i
was
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
section
5,
which
should
be
perspective.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
19
cents
(inaudible).
