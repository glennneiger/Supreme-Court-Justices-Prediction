mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
a
case
which
arises
under
the
natural
gas
act.
and
in
this
case,
we
are
seeking
review
of
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
set
aside
a
decision
of
the
commission
directing
the
respondents
in
this
case,
to
maintain
the
18-cent
guideline
price,
at
which
we
had
temporarily
certificated
their
sales
pending
the
completion
of
the
statutory
hearing
on
their
application
for
permanent
certificate.
the
reason
why
the
commission,
in
granting
them
a
temporary
certificate
at
18
cents,
said
that,
"until
we
get
finished
with
the
hearing
on
the
permanent
certificate,
you
may
not
raise
the
price
even
though
the
contract
here
called
for
20
cents."
it
was
because
the
commission
found
that
collecting
20
cents
during
the
period
after
the
expiration
of
the
five-month
suspension
period,
the
mere
collection
of
20
cents,
even
though
it
would
be
subject
to
refund
would
adversely
affect
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
substantially
impair
our
ability
to
hold
the
line
while
we
were
making
the
inline
determination
which,
of
course
this
court,
directed
us
to
do
in
the
catco
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
determination
that
we
are
acquired
to
make
under
this
decision
--
court's
decision
in
what
i
call
the
catco
case
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
atlantic
refining
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
case
at
360,
is
to
determine
before
we
grant
a
permanent
certificate,
whether
the
price
is
in
line.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
alright.
and
that
was
what
--
and
we
said,
we'll
give
you
18
cents
which
is
our
guideline
price
until
we
determine
what
the
actual
inline
price
is.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
shall
indicate
later,
didn't
really
disagree
with
our
factual
conclusion
that
allowing
them
to
go
up
20
cents
would
interfere
with
our
ability
to
hold
the
line.
but
the
court
believe
that
we
were
without
power
to
do
so
because
as
they
read
the
act,
section
4
gives
parties
a
legal
right
to
file
up
to
their
contract
right
subject
to
the
suspension
provisions,
which
cannot
be
impaired
by
the
exercise
of
the
commission
certificate
powers
under
section
7.
so
the
issue
is
between
the
authority
of
a
party
to
file
up
to
his
contract
rate,
under
section
4
of
the
act
and
the
authority
of
the
commission
operating
in
its
certificate
powers
at
the
threshold
to
say
where
there
are
good
reasons
to
do
so
that
for
this
particular
period
of
time,
you
cannot
collect
up
to
your
contract
price.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
could
suspend
them
as
they
came
up
in
the
future.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
was
last
five
months,
right.
and
i
will
get
it
a
little
later
as
to
why
we
thought
that
was
an
inadequate.
now,
there
are
seven
sales
involved
in
this
proceeding,
all
of
the
various
hunt
interests
who
are
the
respondents
here.
but
the
essential
facts
aren't
in
dispute
and
i
think
we
can
do
what
the
court
below
did,
use
one
set
of
the
sales
that
of
a
hassie
hunt
trust
which
appears
roughly
in
the
joint
appendix
from
about
page
48
to
150,
as
the
example
of
what
happened
here.
now,
this
sale
results
from
a
contract
of
december
15th,
1960
which
is
approximately
three
months
after
the
commission's
phillips
case
and
three
months
after
we
issued
our
guideline
prices.
the
sale
here
was
from
the
alta
loma
area
of
galveston
county,
texas,
and
was
for
gas
at
an
initial
price
according
to
the
contract
of
20
cents
with
four-year
periodic
escalations
of
2
cents
each.
three
months
before,
in
our
statement
of
general
policy,
we
had
announced
as
the
highest
price
which
--
at
which
we
would
certificate
in
the
absence
of
contest,
any
sale,
new
sale
from
this
area
at
18
cents.
what's
more?
a
number
of
the
interveners
who
have
generally
participated
in
these
cases,
some
of
the
distribution
companies
and
the
new
york
public
service
commissions
specifically,
had
announced
that
in
their
view,
the
18-cent
price
was
too
high,
and
that
they
were
going
to
avail
themselves
of
the
right
in
the
statutory
hearing
to
contest
as
to
whether
that
was
in
fact
the
proper
inline
price.
and
they
were
claiming
that
the
inline
price
was,
i
think,
14.6
cents.
so
it
was
perfectly
clear
when
this
sale
was
filed,
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
routine.
the
statutory
hearing
was
not
going
to
be
an
automatic
situation
but
was
going
to
take
considerable
time.
it
was
going
to
be
a
contested
one.
recognizing
this,
the
trust
and
all
the
other
respondents,
exercised
their
rights
under
the
commission
rules
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
with
page
45,
rule
15728,
to
seek
temporary
authorization.
the
commission
recognizing
the
particular
problems
of
producers
of
natural
gas
has
been
very
liberal
in
providing
a
mechanism
whereby
producers
who
wish
to
do
so,
can
commence
operation
prior
to
the
granting
of
a
permanent
certificate,
of
course
subject
to
the
outcome
thereof.
and,
the
trust
did
in
fact
request
a
temporary
certificate
at
the
20
cent
price.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
if
the
problem
--
if
the
case
is
not
contested
and
unusually
the
contest
is
a
matter
of
price,
although
not
always.
if
the
matter
is
not
contested
under
our
present
regulations
which
we
put
into
effect
about
a
year
ago
to
take
five
weeks,
it
did
take
a
little
longer
prior
to
that
but
never
has
taken
more
than
about
two
or
three
months.
if
it's
contested,
it
takes
considerably
longer.
now,
it
is
a
shortening
period
and
i
--
i
can't
really
give
you
any
norm.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
the
--
this
court's
catco
decision
in
1960,
unfortunately,
did
not
settle
everything.
and
the
type
of
evidence
and
type
of
matters
to
be
considered
by
the
commission
in
fixing
the
inline
price
has
proven
to
be
a
very
debatable
matter
as
a
result
of
a
series
of
decisions
in
various
courts
of
appeals.
we
now,
have
got
worked
out
a
fairly
streamline
procedure
and
these
inline
price
cases,
the
certificate
cases,
can
go
much
faster
than
they
did
in
this
one
which
took
considerable
time,
various
blocks
of
proposed
evidence
are
now
excluded,
at
least
with
approval
of
the
circuit
courts.
but
even
then,
if
it's
a
fully
contested
case
and
there
are
interveners
as
well,
i
think
you
can
say
that
a
year
to
18
months
is
the
period.
but
at
the
earlier
stages,
it
took
longer.
and
producers,
a
lot
of
producers
would
much
rather
start
and
take
their
risk
rather
than
wait
this
period
and
as
i
say,
the
commission
has
made
it
possible
for
them
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
that's
one
of
the
risks,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
one
of
the
risks
at
least
in
our
view
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
another
risk.
another
risk
is
they
wouldn't
get
a
certificate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
or
get
a
certificate
of
price
much
lower
than
they
would
like.
well,
they
asked
for
a
temporary
certificate
claiming
that
they
were,
otherwise,
be
forced
to
pay
shut-in
royalties
and
that
there
would
be
drainage
from
their
acreage
to
other
producers
serving
other
pipelines.
and
the
commission
on
april
7th,
1961,
granted
them
a
temporary
certificate.
i'm
reading
from
page
87
of
the
record.
but
if
you
will
look
there,
you
will
see
that
the
commission
did
not
grant
them
a
certificate
for
what
they
asked,
not
at
the
20
cent
price.
instead,
the
commission
had
three
conditions
in
the
certificate.
one,
that
the
initial
price
should
not
exceed
18
cents.
two,
that
within
20
days,
they
should
file
new
billing
statements
and
rate
schedules,
so
specify.
and
three,
that
this
condition
certificate
be
accepted
by
an
official
of
the
company
within
20
days.
now,
the
trust
actually
begun
operation
pursuant
to
this
temporary
authority
on
april
19th,
but
we
were
not
notified
of
that
acceptance
until
may
5th,
and
the
acceptance
which
was
filed
on
may
5th
was
a
very
conditional
acceptance.
in
effect,
what
the
trust
said
was,
"we
don't
think
you
have
any
authority
do
anything
you've
done
and
we're
petitioning
for
rehearing
of
everything.
but
we
are
willing
to
accept
the
18-cent
price
for
30
days,
provided
you
are
willing
at
the
end
of
that
30-day
period
to
let
us
go
back
to
our
20
cent
contract
price."
this,
the
commission
rejected.
and
on
may
31st,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
113
and
114
of
the
record.
the
commission
wrote
the
trust
a
letter
explaining
that
this
was
not
satisfactory.
it
said
that
the
provision
for
charging
20
cents,
30
days
after,
is
in
conflict
with
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
rate
condition
attached
to
the
temporary
condition
and
your
acceptance
is
hereby
rejected.
it
pointed
out
that,
and
i
quote,
"conditions
of
a
temporary
authorization
should
be
specifically
complied
with
and
compliance
be
without
revised
counter
price
for
justice,
which
conflict
with
the
purpose
of
the
conditions."
and
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
the
condition
itself,
the
first
condition
was
modified
to
read
that
the
total
price
should
not
exceed
18
cents
with
such
rate
to
be
effective
for
the
duration
of
the
temporary
authorization
and
until
a
different
prospective
rate
is
established.
well,
the
trust
petitioned
for
rehearing
of
this,
this
petition
was
rejected
and
this
appeal
along
with
the
other
appeals
were
filed.
however,
there's
one
further
fact
before
we
get
to
the
court's
decision,
and
that
is
a
letter
of
november
2nd,
1961
which
the
commission
wrote
to
the
trust
in
which
appears
on
pages
141
to
148
of
the
record.
this
action
was
taken
in
conformity
with
section
19
(a)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
which
expressly
authorizes
the
case
and
authorizes
with
the
commission,
until
the
record
in
a
--
an
appeal
proceeding
is
filed
on
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
page
of
this
letter
is
141.
i'm
reading
from
the
numbers
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
may
be
confusing
because
there's
several
page
--
number
sir.
as
i
say,
we
are
authorized
by
the
act
to
modify
or
set
aside
and
whole
apart
any
finding
or
order
prior
to
the
time
we
filed
the
record
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
availed
ourselves
of
that
right
here
in
this
letter
to
explain
in
somewhat
greater
detail
the
reasons
why
we
had
imposed
this
condition.
if
you
look
at
this
letter,
you
will
see
that
it
explains,
as
i've
already
indicated
that
we
had
previous
to
the
sale
established
an
18-cent
guideline,
it
discusses
certain
sales
which
the
trust
had
raised,
which
they
claim
justified
that
20
cent
guideline
and
pointed
out
why
this
was
not
appropriate
then
fit
this
particular
factual
situation
and
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
it
is.
i'm
sorry,
it's
--
the
letter
i'm
talking
about,
started
144.
did
i
say
141?
i
--
i
beg
the
court
a
pardon,
yes.
and
then,
i'm
now
going
to
read
the
very
last
four
words
in
147.
the
commission
said,
"the
condition
in
the
temporary
authorization
preventing
you
from
charging
or
collecting,"
i'm
reading
at
the
top
of
page
148,
"collecting
more
than
18
cents
per
mcf."
during
the
term
of
that
authorization,
without
expressing
prior
commission
approval
is
necessary
to
permit
the
commission
to
carry
out
its
duty
to
give
careful
scrutiny
to
producer
prices
in
issuing
permanent
certificates
citing
catco.
if
you
were
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
procedures
of
section
4
(d)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
during
a
period
of
your
temporary
authorization,
the
commission
could
not
prevent
increased
rates
from
becoming
effective,
even
though
those
rates
might
irrevocably
breach
the
price
line
or
trigger
price
increases.
it
has
not
been
shown
that
the
public
interest
would
permit
temporary
authorization
of
the
proposed
sale
without
the
condition
heretofore
specific
right.
and
if,
your
honors,
you
will
look
back
on
page
146
of
the
paragraph
of
the
bottom
of
that
page,
you
will
see
that
in
this
case,
the
commission
specifically
referred
to
information
in
its
files
which
indicated
that
this
particular
20
cent
price
might
have
a
triggering
effect.
not
with
respect
to
natural
gas
pipeline
because
as
mr.
generelly
will
point
out,
they
were
already
as
of
that
time
although
subsequently
not,
receiving
gas
at
20
cents
what
as
result
of
renegotiation
provisions,
which
are
generally
the
type
where
a
contract
provides
that
at
set
times,
renegotiations
may
take
place
in
a
higher
price
fixed
on
the
basis
of
the
average
prices
of
three
or
four
other
pipelines
in
the
area.
the
commission
pointed
to
certain
specific
contracts
which
it
felt,
were
in
jeopardy
of
that
type
of
thing
if
these
higher
rates
went
into
effect.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
they
agreed
with
the
commission
or
which
they
didn't
disagree
with
the
commission
as
to
the
actual
effect
of
allowing
this
rate
to
escalate
the
20
cents
on
30
days
notice.
they
said
of
course,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
333
of
the
record,
of
course
that
makes
maintenance
of
the
price
line
something
less
than
completely
effective.
but
the
court
felt
that
--
and
again
i
am
quoting,
"this
was
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
a
unique
statutory
regulatory
scheme
in
which,"
citing
this
court's
decision
in
the
mobile
case
at
350
u.s.
as
mobile
points
out,
rates
are
initially
prescribed
and
increased
by
private
contract.
it
felt
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case,
which
of
course
is
subsequent
to
mobile,
which
has
said
that
the
commission
can
and
may
prescribe
price
conditions,
only
authorized
us
to
prescribe
initial
price
conditions
which
would
set
a
floor,
and
would
not
allow
us
to
go
beyond
that
to
establish
anything
which
would
last
more
than
the
30
days
or
five-month
suspension
period
necessary
to
implement
the
price
raising
procedures
of
section
4
(d).
specifically,
as
the
court
phrased
it,
not
everything
is
lost
since,
as
catco
contemplated,
any
contract
increases
are
collected
subject
to
refunds.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
basically
held
that
section
4
of
the
act
gives
what
they
described
as
a
right
to
a
party
to
file
an
increase
rate.
and
section
7
of
the
act,
which
gives
the
commission
authority
to
grant
certificates
where
the
public
interest
is
--
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
and
authorizes
us
to
condition
certificates
as
the
public
condition
--
convenience
and
necessity
requires,
cannot
be
used
to
interfere
with
this
supposed
right
to
file
price
increases
up
to
the
contract
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
will
try
and
demonstrate
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
will
indicate
right
of
that,
however,
your
honor,
that
your
honors'
decision
in
the
mobile
case
which
is
asserted
as
the
primary
authority
will
claim
that
there
is
a
right
which
the
commission
can
do
nothing
about
to
file
any
price
increase
up
to
the
contracts.
your
honors'
decision
made
clear,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
339
of
the
opinion
which
begins
on
350
u.s.
of
332.
on
its
phase,
section
4
(d),
that's
the
price
rising
case,
is
simply
a
prohibition,
not
a
grant
of
power.
it
does
not
purport
to
say
what
is
effective
to
change
a
contract.
any
more
than
4
(c)
purports
to
define
what
constitutes
a
contract
with
the
commission.
the
section
says
only
that
a
change
cannot
be
made
without
proper
notice
to
the
commission.
it
does
not
say
under
what
circumstances
a
change
can
be
made.
now,
as
i
will
indicate,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
another,
inhibition
on
the
right
of
parties
to
file
rate
increases,
that
the
congress
did
not
leave
the
limitation
of
this
right
to
private
contract
that
is
a
limitation
but
super
imposed
on
that
limitation
by
section
7
of
the
act
as
expressed
amended
in
1942,
is
the
authority
of
the
commission
in
appropriate
circumstances
where
there
is
a
good
reason
to
do
so
to
also
limit
this
right
and
that
of
course
is
the
knob
of
this
issue
here.
let
me
refer
to
the
catco
case,
which
i
think
is
really
the
prime
case
in
this
field.
and
i'm
reading
from
justice
clark's
decision
on
page
388
of
the
decision
which
begins
at
360
u.s.
378.
and
there,
he
starts
with
the
premise,
that
the
purpose
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
to
underwrite
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
the
consumers
of
natural
gas,
and
the
act
was
so
framed
as
to
afford
consumers
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
i'll
repeat
that
because
that
basically
is
the
knob
of
our
case
here
today,
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
and
if
you
read
the
catco
case,
which
incidentally
is
the
first
pace
in
which
this
court
really
focuses
on
the
existence
of
section
7.
if
you
will
read
the
mobile
case
or
the
memphis
case,
and
you'll
be
astounded
to
find
out
that
they
don't
even
mention
section
7.
and
i
read
back
on
the
briefs
in
the
memphis
case
and
the
mobile
case,
and
they
don't
mention
section
7
either.
the
first
time
these
cases
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
not
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
accusing
the
court.
i'm
overlooking
something
it
should
have
considered.
i
don't
think
they're
about
section
7
either.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that,
if
you
want
to
get
what
this
court
is
thinking
of
as
to
what
section
7
means,
the
first
place
you
look
is
the
catco
decision
which
is
the
first
time
it
focused
on
this
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
will
get
to
the
subject
shortly.
i
do
want
to
first,
get
over
what
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
focused
on
as
we
don't
have
power
irrespective
of
the
circumstances.
the
catco
case,
i
hope
i'm
not
confusing
the
court
by
referring
to
this
decision
as
catco
which
is
a
trade
term,
it's
the
atlantic
refining
company
case,
went
on
subsequent
to
spell
out
the
commission's
powers
under
section
7.
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
391
where
justice
clark
said,
after
indicating
that
section
7's
powers
are
more
important
during
this
formative
period
when
ground
rules
of
producer
regulation
are
being
an
evolved,
said,
"where
the
application
on
its
phase
or
on
presentation
of
evidence,
signals
the
existence
of
a
situation
that
probably
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
a
permanent
certificate
should
not
be
issued,
but
then
recognizing
that
execution
maybe
too
hard
a
remedy."
he
went
onto
say,
where
--
there
is
of
course
available
on
such
a
situation
a
method
by
which
the
applicant
and
the
commission
can
arrive
at
a
rate
that
isn't
keeping
with
the
public
interest.
the
commission
has
authorized
the
--
the
congress
has
authorized
the
commission
to
condition
certificates,
where
the
proposed
price
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
public
interest
because
it
is
out
of
line
as
this
was,
or
because
its
approval
might
result
in
triggering
of
general
price
rises
as
the
commission
found
these
words,
or
an
increase
in
the
applicant's
existing
wage
by
reason
of
favored
nation
clauses
or
otherwise.
the
commission,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
might
attach
such
conditions
as
it
believes
necessary.
and
there's
more
to
the
catco
case
but
basically,
that's
what
the
situation
is.
now,
it's
argued
by
the
respondents
and
it
was
argued
in
the
court
below
that
catco
despite
this
language
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
have
a
fixed
limitation
for
any
duration
of
time
beyond
the
five
month
suspension
period
on
a
price
increase,
because
of
certain
language
in
the
catco
case
which
indicates
that
there
was
no
such
limitation
in
that
case.
but
we
believe
that
both
catco
and
the
statutory
scheme
cannot
be
so
narrowly
limited.
the
catco
situation
after
all,
was
a
case
in
which
the
commission
was
claiming
that
there
was
no
need,
they
should
be
claiming
at
the
commission
level,
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
condition.
and
the
people
who
were
arguing
before
this
court,
for
some
price
condition,
assumed
that
a
refund
obligation
of
the
type
which
had
been
originally
suggested
to
the
commission
would
be
adequate
it
was,
therefore,
quite
appropriate
for
this
court
to
make
the
same
assumption
and
to
point
out
quite
correctly
that
under
the
particular
condition
in
the
catco
case,
they
could
file
an
increase.
but
that,
we
do
not
believe
means
that
they
could
never
file
an
increase.
if
the
commission
could,
as
it
has
subsequently
done,
find
that
the
mere
collection
of
a
price,
subject
to
refund,
would
have
the
same,
or
not
quite
the
same,
would
have
adverse
effects
on
its
ability
to
maintain
the
price
line.
i
backtrack
fast
there
because
obviously,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
refund
obligations
are
of
no
value.
they
are
of
real
value
and
a
refund
obligation
is
much
better
than
a
situation
without
a
refund
obligation.
but
as
this
court
recognized,
just
the
last
term,
in
the
tennessee
gas
case,
refunds,
though
useful,
though
valuable,
are
far
from
a
complete
protection
to
the
public.
that
particular
case
happened
to
involve
the
consumer's
end
of
the
refund
directly.
and,
justice
clark's
decision
there
noted,
the
obvious
fact
that
when
three
or
four
years
later,
you
ought
a
refunds
to
go
back
to
the
public,
they
just
don't
all
get
back.the
public
has
moved
away.
some
of
the
public
isn't
there.
the
expenses
of
ordering
refunds
are
such
that
a
--
inevitably
no
matter
how
hard
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
state
commissions
try
and
we've
been
trying
and
spending
a
great
deal
of
out
time
on
this
subject.
inevitably,
refunds
do
not
fully
protect
the
public
in
that
sense.mr.
solomon,
supposing
the
commission
felt
that
a
permanent
--
a
permanent
certificated
company
was
filing
too
many
applications
and
it
took
an
applications
and
said,
"alright,
we
will
grant
you
these
inquiries
on
condition
however,
that
you
don't
file
further
applications
at
more
frequent
periods
and
five
year
intervals,"
could
it
--
would
it
have
the
commission
has
the
power
to
do
that?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
my
opinion,
the
commission
has
the
power
to
do
that
once.
and
this
is
the
importance
here.
the
commission's
basic
authority
to
limit
contractual
provisions
is
when
it
permanently
certificates
a
sale.
and
this
is
what
it's
done
from
the
very
beginning
of
certificate
jurisdiction.
it's
none
so
on
all
sorts
of
ways.
in
the
panhandle
case
cited
in
our
brief,
panhandle
pipe
line
came
to
us
with
a
proposal.
we
said,
"this
is
no
good
unless
you
include
in
your
rate
schedule
a
rate
for
certain
type
of
interruptible
service.
if
you
will
do
that,
we'll
allow
you
to
have
a
certificate."
panhandle
did
it.
then
several
months
later,
having
done
it,
they
filed
a
4
(d)
new
tariff
which
surprisingly
enough,
eliminated
this
provision.
they
tried
to
use
section
4
(d)
to
get
around
this
certificate
condition.
in
the
third
circuit,
in
the
case
--
panhandle
case
recited
at
203
f.2d,
threw
it
out
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
not
a
proper
use
to
section
4
(d),
but
the
commission
does
have
authority
when
it
is
granting
a
certificate
to
change
the
terms
of
the
contract
of
which
price
of
course
is
an
important
but
not
the
only
one
to
require
where
the
public
interest
so
requires,
that
it
will
not
certificate
the
sale
at
all
unless
the
contractual
terms
upon
which
it
is
granted
or
changed.
similarly,
in
the
alabama,
tennessee
case
cited
in
our
brief,
there
we
had
granted
a
new
pipeline.
it's
quite
analogous
to
this
case
because
it
--
it's
somewhat
like
the
temporary
situation
we
have
here.
there,
we
had
granted
a
new
pipeline
certificate
powers
but
we
couldn't
agree
upon
the
rates,
so
we
just
told
them
to
put
in
a
temporary
rate
until
such
time
as
they
could
decree
on
a
permanent
rate.
and
before
they
could
file
that
and
agree
with
us
on
the
permanent
rate,
they
tried
to
use
section
4
(d)
to
raise
the
interim
rate
on
30
days
notice.
and
judge
hastie,
in
the
case
cited
there
in
our
brief,
judge
hastie
of
the
third
circuit
threw
it
out
again
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
of
our
brief
saying
that,
"to
treat
the
interim
rate
permitted
as
the
kind
of
rate
which
is
subject
to
change
on
the
free
initiative
of
the
company
under
section
4
(d),
is
to
ignore
the
restrictive
context
in
which
it
was
allowed
to
become
effective.
only
after
such
an
initial
determination
with
satisfactory
rate
could
the
company
properly
claimed
that
it
was
operated
under
the
kind
of
tariff
that
is
subject
to
change
by
section
4
(d)
procedure.
once
the
commission,
justice
harlan,
certificates
a
sale
permanently,
once
after
a
hearing,
the
commission
permanently
certificates
its
sale,
its
authority
to
change
the
contractual
provisions
upon
which
that
sale
is
certificated
is
very
circumscribed,
if
it
exist
at
all.
and
i
am
not
arguing
here
that
if
we
allow
a
permanent
certificate
to
go
through
and
do
not
condition
it,
that
we
can
subsequently
say,
"you
can't
exercise
your
powers
under
section
4
(d)."
i
am
arguing
that
the
whole
reason
why
congress,
in
1942,
amended
the
certificate
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
amended
them
to
give
us
this
conditioning
power
and
to
spell
out
the
reasons
why
we
could
deny
certificates,
was
as
the
house
committee
made
clear
at
that
time
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
26
of
our
brief."
the
bill
when
enacted
will
have
the
effect
of
giving
the
commission
an
opportunity
to
scrutinize
the
financial
setup,
the
adequacy
of
gas
reserves,
the
feasibility
and
adequacy
of
proposed
services,
and
the
characteristics
of
the
rate
structure
in
connection
with
the
proposed
construction
or
extension
at
a
time
when
such
vital
matters
can
be
readily
modified
as
the
public
interest
may
demand."
this
is
the
point
of
congress
giving
us
these
additional
powers
in
1942
because
it
had
developed
for
that
without
these
powers.
the
commission
could
not
prevent
the
certification
of
operations
which
later
proved
to
be
unwarranted,
unused.
i
was
discussing
the
difficulties
with
the
refund
conditions
and
i
do
not
want
to
rely
solely
on
the
tennessee
case
because,
although
i
think
this
is
important
and
i
do
not
mean
to
underestimate
it,
is
by
no
means
the
only
problem
with
refund
conditions
in
this
particular
context
of
producer
sales.
they're
at
least
two
other
difficulties.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
must
say
justice
clark
pointed
out
i
think
fairly
last
year
in
his
dissent
in
the
wisconsin
case,
i
don't
agree
with
all
of
it
but
this
point,
i
think
would
certainly
sound.
the
mere
collection
of
high
prices
in
the
field
which
are
going
to
at
least
be
that
high
for
a
year
or
so,
have
traditionally
--
it
has
been
found
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
the
language
i
read
you
earlier,
resulted
in
raising
the
general
price
structure.
and
the
fact
that
these
prices
maybe
subject
to
refund
at
some
later
date
does
not
prevent
that
from
happening.
this
is
a
fact.
this
is
what
has
happened
time
after
time.
if
the
prices
go
up,
there
are
various
reasons
why
other
prices
will
go
up.
one
of
them,
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
is
the
strange
"tinker
to
evers
to
chance"
situation
resulting
in
the
effect
of
an
interstate
price
on
intrastate
prices
which
in
turn
affect
interstate
prices.
so
the
mere
collection
of
higher
prices
in
the
field,
inevitably
have
the
effect
of
raising
the
field
prices.
more
important
perhaps,
again
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
you
have
the
potential
triggering
effect
of
one
group
of
high
prices
on
other
groups
of
high
prices.
now
gentlemen,
theoretically,
if
the
triggering
price
is
subject
to
refund,
you
might
think
that
this
whole
house
of
cards
would
automatically
collapse
if
and
when
you
can
get
rid
of
this
high
triggering
price
at
some
subsequent
time.
believe
me,
it
doesn't
happen
that
way.
all
sorts
of
things
can
happen.
we
have
an
--
a
very
good
example.
we
have
a
series
of
sales
which
were
made
in
the
early
90
--
late
1950s
in
southern
louisiana
at
a
very
high
price,
i
think
about
23
and
a
half
cents.
all
of
which
were
subsequently
set
aside
by
this
court.
but
in
the
meantime,
they
had
triggered
a
substantial
number
of
other
sales
in
that
area.
and
these
other
sales
were
in
various
postures.
some
people
had
triggered
up
to
the
higher
rate
and
then
had
renegotiated
their
contracts
and
gotten
rid
of
further
escalations
at
a
later
date
in
response
to
a
fixed
price
at
this
triggered
price.
do
they
have
contract
authority?
maybe
they
are
now
the
basis
for
the
other
triggered
sales.
other
people
had
gotten
a
permanent
certificate
by
mischance.
they'd
gotten
a
permanent
certificate
because
the
commission
had
tried
to
reject
the
certificate
and
in
turn
it
turned
out
that
they
were
not
rejectable.
they're
only
suspendible
but
by
the
time
we
tried
to
suspend
them
it
was
too
late.
there
are
other
circumstances
in
which
that
i
could
go
through
but
the
fact
is
that
once
the
genie
is
out
of
the
bottle,
i
won't
say
you
can't
get
them
back,
but
i
will
only
say
is
that,
the
commission
has
not
found
aladdin's
magic
word
to
get
him
back
yet.
what's
more?
we're
making
an
assumption
here.
we're
making
an
assumption
that
we
will
get
him
back
in
the
bottle.
now,
maybe
we
will
but
maybe
we
won't.
one
of
the
respondents
here
is
caroline
hunt
sands.
now,
caroline
hunt
sands
--
now,
in
the
form
of
caroline
hunt
sands
doing
business
with
her
husband
is
claiming
in
a
new
commission
proceeding
not
involved
in
this
case.
that
she
has
cost,
if
you
want
to
consider
her
own
private
cost.
well,
she
has
various
types
of
cost
but
the
minimum
she
claims
is
about
33
cents.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
right
or
wrong.
i
think
we
are
arguing
that
it's
not
right
but
it
illustrates
the
point.
it's
possible
that
a
given
producer,
because
of
a
number
of
dry
holes
or
other
reasons,
will
have
very
high
cost.
and
it's
possible
that
a
producer
with
very
high
cost
will
be
able
to
induce
as
caroline
hunt
sands'
unfortunately
has,
produced
pipelines
to
certificate
her
at
contract
prices,
which
are
higher
than
any
other
price
in
the
area.
how
are
we
going
to
get
that
back
into
the
bottle?
basically,
i
think
the
respondents
here
are
claiming
a
right,
an
absolute
right
to
be
certificated
at
any
price
which
is
just
and
reasonable
in
terms
of
their
own
cost
of
service
including
a
reasonable
return.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
we
have
powers
in
temporary
certificates,
that
the
circumstances,
they
are
factually
or
such
that
we
can
restrict
price
rises
where
it
might
be
more
doubtful
than
permanent
certificate
cases,
but
we
claim
that
the
right
is
the
same
and
we
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
it's
an
a
fortiori
situation
on
what
we
claim
is
the
statutory
scheme
generally.
we
have,
for
example,
the
commission
in
my
opinion
has
very
strong
powers
under
its
certificate
authority.
the
commission,
in
my
opinion
properly
and
certainly,
whether
it's
my
opinion
or
not
actually,
has
been
very
careful
about
exercising
contrary
to
what
my
friends
on
the
other
side
say,
"we
have
not
established
a
price
freeze
until
we
can
finish
the
area
rate
cases."
and
we
haven't
done
so,
although
as
i
read
catco,
that's
suggested
as
a
possibility
in
the
catco
decision,
but
we're
not
doing
that.
we
are,
however,
when
we
issue
permanent
certificates
which
have
contract
provisions
which
would
--
if
applied,
result
in
this
type
of
triggering.
we
are
imposing
contractor
--
i
--
i
mean
we
are
imposing
conditions
on
those,
prohibiting
them
from
filing
above
a
certain
rate.
we're
not
holding
them
down
to
the
inline
rate
largely
because
we
think
it
will
be
unfair
to
the
new
permittees
since
the
old
permittees
who
got
grants
without
certificates
can
file,
but
we
are
providing
with
respect
to
new
certificates
that
they
cannot
file
above
the
triggering
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
found
that
in
most
cases,
there
has
been
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
producers
to
take
advantage
of
the
rights
they
do
have
to
file
prices
higher
than
the
inline
price
we
have
found.
we've
had
producers
who
have
said
that
the
inline
price
is
not
only
terrible
and
outrageous
but
they
would
seriously
consider
taking
the
gas
off
the
market
but
they
never
asked
us
to,
and
have
not
even
subsequently
filed
to
raise
their
rates.
but
there
are
other
producers
that
do
file
to
raise
their
rates
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
on
which
--
on
which
at
least
one
of
the
respondents
here
is
a
--
an
example,
although
not
in
this
case
of
course.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
no,
i
don't
--
if
somebody
--
if
the
commission
has
not
used
its
certificate
powers
to
prevent
something,
we
cannot
say
it's
a
misuse
of
forged
--
of
section
4
for
people
to
use
their
contractual
rights.
it's
a
nuisance
of
course,
and
where
they
filed
these
cases
which
do
triggering,
the
only
thing
we've
been
able
to
do
is
set
them
down
for
immediate
hearing
and
hope
that
we
can
dispose
of
the
case
on
an
individual
company
basis
quickly.
it's
very
difficult
to
do
but
we
can't
complain
because
it's
probably
our
fault.
we
should
have
certificated
these
people
against
this
many
years
ago
but
we're
just
waking
up
to
the
powers
we
have
in
this
act
and
if
we
were
living
with
20/20
hindsight,
we
would
have
done
a
lot
of
things
differently
in
the
past.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
did
--
i
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
details
of
this
particular
situation.
this
is
the
same
field
as
a
previous
permanently
certificated
20-cent
price,
which
was
set
aside
by
the
commission
after
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
we
had
improperly
excluded
the
new
york
public
service
commission.
we
have
held
a
new
hearing
which
is
final
with
respect
to
those
other
20-cent
prices,
subject
to
appeal.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission's
action
is
final
and
we
have
found
that
the
proper
inline
price
for
this
other
sales
were
16
cents.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
originally
approved
20.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
temporary
application
in
february
20,
1961,
it's
about
a
year
after
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
the
original
sale
and
the
case
at
that
time
was
in
the
court,
so
on
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
had
not
yet
been
reversed.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
reversal
took
place
while
this
case
was
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
second
application,
some
of
them
had
pure
--
we
--
here,
we
got
to
a
difference
between
the
two.
some
of
them
including
the
hassie
hunt
sales
and
the
two
hunt
sales
did
not
ask
for
the
same
thing
that
we
had
limited
to.
we
had
limited
to
20
cents
with
an
escalation
after
10
years,
and
these
sales
are
for
20
cents
with
escalations
after
four
years.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
points
this
out.
some
of
the
other
contracts
involved
here
did
have
the
same
escalations
as
happened
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
all
of
these
were
conditioned
the
same
way.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
idea
that
somebody
is
entitled
to
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
entitle,
as
a
matter
of
law
to
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
irrespective
of
what
that
rate
might
be,
based
on
their
own
cost
in
a
reasonable
rate
of
return.
it
was
rejected
by
this
court
at
least
65
years
ago.
and
i
don't
have
the
time
to
read
it
but
if
you
will
--
gentlemen
will
look
at
the
covington
&
lexington
turnpike
case,
164
u.s.,
which
was
in
turn,
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
black
in
an
interstate
case
a
number
of
years
ago.
you'll
see
that
as
long
ago
as
the
1890s,
this
court
had
recognized
that
utilities
are
not
entitled
to
a
high
price
merely
because
of
their
own
peculiar
financial
situations
and
this
is
certainly
true
where
you
have
a
situation
like
this
one
--
where
you
have
a
situation
like
this
one
where
the
collection
of
this
high
price
is
going
to
have
such
an
adverse
effect
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
covington
&
lexington
turnpike
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
v.
sandford,
164
u.s.
578
and
i
don't
want
to
take
credit
for
having
found
it.
it
was
found
by
justice
black
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
fpc
versus
the
natural
gas
pipeline.
and
we
thank
you.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
let
me
say
a
word
about
this
decision
of
december
9th.
in
that
case,
we
held
with
respect
to
the
certificates
in
this
area,
the
earlier
ones
before
september
20,
1960.
that
the
commission
had
been
mistaken
fixing
an
18
cent
guideline
price
and
that
the
proper
inline
price
was
16
cents.
we
do
allow
them
under
that
permanent
certificate
within
the
limits
of
their
contract
to
file
between
16
cents
and
19
cents.
but
we've
said
we
will
not
allow
them
to
file
above
19
cents
because
that
--
as
we
figured
it
out
is
the
triggering
price
in
this
area
as
of
today.
now,
why
were
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
it
was
a
particular
contracts
but
we
discover
--
we
made
the
findings
on
the
escalation
from
these
pricing
areas.
now,
the
only
reason
that
the
contracts
in
issue
with
here
were
not
also
given
an
inline
price
of
16
cents
was
that
the
commission
said,
the
inline
price
as
of
september
20th,
1960
was
16
cents.
but
your
contracts
were
made
three
months
later
and
we
will
give
you
an
option
of
showing
in
a
further
proceeding
that
in
fact
that
the
commission
fixed
an
18
cent
price
somehow
affected
the
inline
price.
in
the
meantime,
we
can
collect
18
cents
but
we
didn't
cut
them
back
immediately
to
16
cents
of
the
inline
price.
we're
giving
these
people
an
option
to
show
that
the
inline
price
should
be
higher
because
of
the
effect,
if
any,
of
the
commission
setting
an
18
cent
price
on
september
20th,
1960.
now,
this
gets
i
think
to
the
problem
i
want
to
end
with
which
is
the
temporary
authority
that's
asked
here
and
the
peculiar
problems
that
we're
faced
with
there.
this
court
told
us
in
catco
that
we
have
to
fix
an
inline
price
and
whatever
the
difficulties
may
be,
we
have
to
fix
it
after
a
statutory
hearing
in
which
not
only
the
commission
but
all
consumer
elements
can
be
allowed
into
the
proceeding
to
decide
and
argue
what
they
think
the
inline
price
is.
but
this
particular
case
comes
up
one
step
earlier.
it
comes
up
at
the
preliminary
period
when
we
know
we're
going
to
have
to
have
a
hearing
before
we
can
grant
any
permanent
certificate.
and
these
people
i
asked
for
a
temporary
certificate
so
they
can
get
over
an
emergency
period.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
the
commission
could
say
for
temporary
purposes,
"we're
going
to
give
you
a
relatively
low
rate
which
will
give
you
some
money
but
we
don't
have
to
give
you
anything
close
to
what
we
think
the
proper
guideline
is.”
but
the
commission
hasn't
done
that.
the
commission
has
said,
"we'll
allow
somebody
coming
in
at
this
temporary
period,
the
full
guideline
price
with
which
we
would
be
agreed
to
certificate
this
thing
if
there
is
no
consumer
opposition."
but
we
won't
give
you
anymore.
now,
whatever
the
justification
might
be
and
whatever
the
commission
need
to
find
in
a
way
of
findings
after
a
hearing
to
make
conditions
on
a
permanent
certificate,
it
seems
to
make
clear
that
when
people
come
in
and
ask
not
for
a
right,
they
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
under
section
7
(e)
of
the
act
if
they
can
show
that
it's
in
the
public
interest
and
convenience.
but
they
have
no
right
to
a
temporary
grant.
this
is
--
well,
all
discretion
is
limited
by
reasonableness
of
course
but,
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
commission's
discretion
on
reasonableness
is
very
great.
and
the
commission
says,
if
you
want
start
proceedings,
before
we
can
have
the
determination
as
to
what
the
inline
rate
is,
then,
we
are
going
to
give
you
no
more
than
this
set
figure.
if
you
don't
want
to
start
at
that,
this
gas
isn't
worth
it
because,
the
only
basis
upon
which
it's
worth
all
the
while
to
allow
you
to
start
initially,
before
we
can
have
a
statutory
hearing
to
determine
what
the
court
said
we
have
to
fix
the
inline
price
in
catco
is
at
this
point.
now,
as
i
say,
if
we
fix
a
much
lower
price,
in
18
cents,
i
think
it
was
--
been
our
--
with
our
power.
and
when
in
fact
we
set
a
price
of
18
cents
which
turns
out
to
be
two
cents
more
than
the
guideline
was
three
months,
then
the
inline
price
was
three
months
before.
i
don't
think
these
people
can
properly
claim
that
we're
being
unreasonable.
on
the
contrary,
the
commission
if
anything
has
leaned
over
back
to
ensure
that
producers
can
get
into
the
market
at
a
price
near
the
top
of
the
market
before
anybody
else
has
a
chance
to
challenge.
and
they
can't
complain
about
that.
if
they
get
in
and
they
want
to
get
out,
they
have
to
ask
us
to
get
out.
that's
true.
they
can
abandon
without
coming
to.
but
this
isn't
a
risk
which
means
that
they
have
the
right
to
charge
more
than
we're
entitled
but
we
want
to
give
them
during
this
error
period.of
course,
as
they
get
in
and
a
pipeline
is
dependent
upon
this
gas,
we're
going
to
have
to
have
them
show
us
what
the
effect
of
getting
out
with
it.
but
to
say
that
abandonment
is
impossible
under
these
circumstances
as
far
from
correct
what
really
is
the
fact
is
that
nobody
has
even
sought
to
abandon
once
they've
gotten
in.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
am
suggesting
that
our
temporary
certificate
power
is
broader.
we
don't
have
to
make
these
complete
findings.
we're
not
operating
on
a
record.
there
is
no
record
or
operating
pretty
much
on
the
basis
of
expertise
or
operating
on
the
basis
of
our
own
judgment.
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
the
sunray
case,
a
condition
on
a
permanent
certificate
may
involve
more
on
the
matter
of
findings
on
the
record.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
the
legal
authority
is
the
same
but
the
circumstances
and
we
can
--
which
we
can
exercise
that
legal
authority
are
much
wider
in
the
temporary
situation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
we're
not
deciding
it's
just
and
reasonable.
the
inline
price
may
be
higher.
it
may
be
lower
than
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
we're
setting
a
starting
price
after
hearing
and
after
full
determination.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
--
i
have
said
that
i
think
we
maybe
but
we
haven't
done
that.
what
--
we've
never
gone
that
far
so
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
question.
all
we
have
said
with
the
permanent
certificates
so
far
is
that
we
will
not
let
you
file
more
than
three
or
four
cents
above
the
inline
price,
a
price
which
would
start
all
these
spiral
increases
of
the
prices
there.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
now,
maybe
we
could
go
below
that.
maybe
we
could
require
during
this
interim
period
until
we've
fixed
area
rates
that
the
inline
price
be
maintained.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
this
is
something
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
at
least
in
this
case
because
the
commission
has
never
claimed
that
as
something
that
it
was
--
that's
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
this
case,
the
commission
within
the
last
year
has
set
an
area
rate
proceeding
for
the
texas
gulf
and
it
will
be
decided
in
that
proceeding.
i'd
say
two
or
three
years
from
now.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we'd
only
grant
them
a
permanent,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
the
area
proceeding
which
is
about
two,
three,
four
years
down
the
road.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
two,
three,
four
years
down
the
road.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
let
me
be
--
let
me
be
perfectly
frank.
i
--
i
don't
need
to
hide
anything
here.
it
is
conceivable
that
as
a
result
of
our
conditioning
power,
