mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
i
--
i
had
indicated
and
i
understand
however
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
from
the
marshal
that
i
have
five
minutes.
i
would
like
to
hang
up
just
one
thing
in
answer
to
a
question
which
justice
black
asked
shortly
before
the
luncheon
recess,
as
to
what
happens
if
a
producer
comes
in
with
the
contract
of
50
cent
gas
to
begin
with.
i
had
previously
stated
that
this
is
highly
unlikely.
i
am
advised
and
this
is
of
course
subject
to
check
that
in
the
last
year,
of
any
personally
filed
contracts
with
the
commission,
the
highest
escalation
is
30
cents.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
30
cents
in
the
20th
year.
but
let's
assume
that
he
did,
the
producer.
the
court
find
the
pipeline
who
would
write
a
contract
to
50
cents
and
suppose
he
came
in,
the
commission
with
it.
the
commission
irrespective
of
its
jurisdiction
and
its
power
to
in
any
way
alter,
amend
condition
that
price
downward
with
respect
to
the
producer
has
the
undoubted
right
to
refuse.
the
pipeline,
the
right
to
recover
that
higher
cost
and
its
cost
gas
purchase
cost.
now
this
fact
alone
is
deterrent.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
under
section
5.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
would
be
perspectives.
it
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
first
one,
the
g
docket
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
case?
that
went
back.
all
the
evidence
was
excluded.
the
examiner,
he
was
affirmed
by
the
commission
just
this
past
december
and
the
prices
were
reduced
down
to
15
and
16
cents,
and
a
moratorium
was
placed
on
any
filing
before
1968
up
to
20
cents.
they
can
file
up
to
19
but,
there
is
the
moratorium.
they
were
also
ordered
to
refund
all
moneys
collected
since
the
date
the
commission
vacated
their
certificate
up
to
the
present
time
with
interest
of
6
and
7%.
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
first
time
under
this
moratorium
which
has
been
imposed.
they
could
raise
it
to
19
cents
then.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
or
above
--
above
19
cents,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
above
19
cents.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
has
been.
it's
been
further
reduced.
they
were
collecting
18
and
20.
these
are
the
three
districts
involved
in
this
g
docket
case
and
it's
been
further
reduced
down.
the
commission
has
decided
now
it
should've
been
even
lower
than
18
cents.
but,
if
i
might
to
conclude
this
one
point
about
50
cent
gas
that
they
have
to
double
check
on
the
pipeline
even
if
we
could
write
such
a
contract
but
beyond
that
most
producers,
at
least
these
producers
will
not
today
file
for
an
increase
or
price
appreciably
above
area
price.
unless
they
think
they
can
support
it
on
the
basis
of
their
individual
costs,
now
let's
forget
what
those
individual
cost
may
be,
the
point
being
it
will
justify
the
price
and
they
won't
even
come
in
at
the
commission.
i'm
asking
a
deterrent
of
7%
interest.
but,
i
can
only,
in
concluding,
emphasize
one
thing,
what
is
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
today
and
what
it
is
in
the
future
10,
5,
10,
15,
20
years
from
now?
two
different
things,
the
commission
can't
really
know
anymore
than
we
know
whether
a
price
presence
that
is
just
and
reasonable
today
will
be
just
and
reasonable
then
and
vice
versa.
so,
this
thought
that
the
commission
by
preventing
these
filings
or
any
access
at
all
to
the
rate
change
provisions
to
section
4,
can
thereby
freeze
prices
indefinitely
at
--
in
their
sole
discretion
is
i
believe
unethical
to
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
written
by
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
