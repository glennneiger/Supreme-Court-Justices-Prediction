mr.
solomon,
i
take
it
then
you
are
suggesting
that
regardless
of
what
your
conditioning
power
is
upon
the
issuance
of
the
permanent
certificate
that
that
power
is
considerably
broader
in
connection
with
the
temporary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understood
your
main
argument,
you
had
said
that
they
--
you
could
certainly
do
something
like
this
when
you're
granting
a
permanent
certificate,
that
you
can
do
it
there,
you
could
certainly
do
it
on
temporary.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
you
say,
even
if
you
could
on
permanent,
you
can
do
it
on
temporary.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
the
--
when
you
--
when
you
imposed
an
inline
price
to
determine
inline
price
on
granting
a
permanent
certificate,
what
are
you
concluding
really
when
you
--
when
you
set
that
initial
price
that
it's
just
unreasonable
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
would
you
--
you
say
that
you're
--
you're
entitled
in
--
in
granting
a
permanent
certificate
to
impose
a
condition
that
this
inline
price
lasts
for
a
period
of
time
for
example
and
that
--
and
that
again,
that
the
producer
may
not
resort
to
his
section
4
rights
for
five
years
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
you
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
--
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
when
in
this
case,
when
would
a
just
and
reasonable
price
be
determined?
i
mean,
just
--
just
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mechanically,
how
--
how
will
that
affect
this
case?
now
you've
got
there
--
if
you
win
this
case,
they
are
--
going
to
be
operating
under
temporary
certificates
with
these
conditions
and
if
you
will
--
at
some
point
i
suppose
either
grant
them
permanent
certificate
or
not.
and
in
that
point
you
won't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
point,
you
won't
--
and
at
that
point
you
won't
be
making
any
just
and
reasonable
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
when
would
it
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
two
or
three
--
justice
byron
r.
white
down
the
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
--
how
far
down
the
road
is
--
