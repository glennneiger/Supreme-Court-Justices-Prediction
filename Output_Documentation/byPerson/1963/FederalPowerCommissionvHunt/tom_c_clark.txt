you
could
suspend
them
as
they
came
up
in
the
future.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
suspend
each
one
that
was
filed
on
the
future.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
they're
not
allowed
at
18.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
that
would
only
last
five
months.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
the
practice
--
do
you
have
many
refiling
sectors,
new
filings?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
think
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
the
commission
contend
that's
a
misuse
of
4
(d)?
is
this
a
contention
when
they
have
filed
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
facts,
the
--
the
gas
count
from
the
same
field
and
both
leaves
applications,
and
then
in
the
year
19
--
1960
you
issued
a
--
is
that
a
permanent
certificate
in
1960?s
justice
tom
c.
clark
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
originally
approved
20.
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
count
of
technicality
that
was
thrown
out.
now,
well
along
--
how
long,
subsequent
to
that
did
this
temporary
application
come?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice
overlap)
the
year
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
had
been
reversed?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
second
application
asked
for
the
same
rate
in
term
to
escalation,
as
did
the
one
that
you
had
limited,
is
that
right,
put
in
the
escalations?
justice
tom
c.
clark
four
years.
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
of
them
were
conditioned.
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
simply
a
--
area
pricing
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice

the
--
the
permanent
step
that
says
you
do
it
on
an
area
basis.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
the
difference
between
is
simply
this.
you
say
under
4,
you
have
a
price
anytime
you
have
a
contract
to
file
that
with
the
commission
and
they
have
the
right
after
its
expired
is
suspended
for
five
months
and
then
you
collect
on
your
contract
price.
they
say
that
--
that
so
many
of
those
things
filed,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there's
a
tendency
to
cause
an
increase
in
the
area
price
and
therefore,
they
believe
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
condition
all
these
filings
so
that
this
area
price
might
not
--
might
not
be
escalated
so
quickly
that
be
leveled
off
while
they're
considering
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
(voice
overlap)
certification.
justice
tom
c.
clark
sure.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that
intends
to
indicate
any
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
depending
on
the
merits
but
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
how
would
(voice

positions.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
suppose
you're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
some
case
where
the
producer,
they've
used
for
--
they
tried
cut
the
area
price
by
a
series
of
filings,
say
filed
every
30
days.
he
just
had
it
on
his
calendar
and
he
said
could
have
filed
the
date.
for
every
30
days
he
had
filed,
we
will
say
a
2-cent
increase.
do
you
think
the
commission
under
the
act
would
have
any
authority
to
ignore
those
or
not
permit
them
to
be
filed
or
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
there
a
shortage
of
any
state
gas?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i
was
getting
at,
i
understood
mr.
solomon
say
that
one
of
your
contracts
would
be
33
cents
was
it,
or
30?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
a
cost.
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
she
will
be
able
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
she'll
be
able
to
sell
it
at
that
price?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
hadn't
been
able
to
get
one
that

tom

what
about
the
confiscatory?

directionality.

they
got
