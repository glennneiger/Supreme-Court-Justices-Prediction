mr.
frank
b.
parsons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants
in
their
opening
statement
said
that
or
mentioned
two
questions;
one,
may
a
city
issue
an
injunction
to
suppress
in
advance
on
being
--
an
order
to
preserve
(inaudible)
of
the
status
quo.
i
think
that
the
question
might
better
be
stated,
may
a
city
issue
an
injunction
to
suppress
in
advance
a
meeting
to
preserve
the
peace
and
good
order
of
the
city.
appellants
were
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
say
that
a
person
may
decide
for
himself
whether
or
not
he
will
obey
an
injunction.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
i'll
be
glad
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
yes.
the
--
the
other
question
was
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
uphold
the
conviction
of
--
of
contempt
--
of
the
finding
of
contempt.
now,
in
that
--
in
connection
with
that,
it's
my
contention
and
our
position
that
the
court
must
take
into
consideration
the
whole
of
this
thing.
we
ask
you
to
consider
and
considering
that
question,
the
handbill
that
had
been
handed
out,
the
handbill
that
precipitated
this
action
of
the
city.
now,
if
--
if
your
honors
will
examine
that
handbill,
you
will
see
it
has
already
been
classified
as
a
--
that
it
is
a
highly
inflammatory
and
objectionable
piece
of
paper.
it
was
handed
out
indiscriminately
in
our
city.
it
--
it
worried,
it
frightened
our
officials
and
they
--
they
took
this
action.
now,
fields
in
his
testimony
said
that
this
handbill
accurately
reflected
the
tone
of
the
meeting
that
was
called
on
a
handbill,
that
it
accurately
reflected
the
approach
that
would
be
taken
to
the
subjects
to
be
discussed
at
the
meeting
announced
by
the
handbill.
now,
it's
true
enough
that
they
came
or
fields
came,
he
didn't
send
someone
else,
he
came
himself
after
having
been
served
with
the
injunction,
he
came
himself
and
lyons
came
who
was
an
employee
of
the
--
of
the
national
states
rights
party
and
just
shortly
prior
to
the
meeting,
he
mixed
or
--
or
mingled
with
the
crowd
within
among
the
crowd,
spoke
to
them
as
he
says
telling
them
that
the
meeting
was
to
be
at
another
place
over
in
lipscomb,
other
city
in
the
bazemore
cutoff
and
he
handed
out
the
thunderbolt.
now,
let's
go
to
this
question
of
how
many
people
were
there.
chief
morris
says
as
--
as
the
attorney
general
says
that
--
mr.
marshall
says
that
there
was
a
large
crowd
across
the
street.
this
crowd
was
across
the
street.
if
you
examine
the
testimony
of
the
officers
who
testified,
the
officers
say,
“across
the
street.”
the
officers
were
on
the
side
where
the
building
was.
the
crowd
was
across
the
street.
i
don't
want
you
to
get
the
impression
that
there
were
only
52
people
there.
mr.
--
mr.
fields
--
dr.
fields
handed
out
12
thunderbolts
himself,
mr.
lyons
was
also
is
handing
out
thunderbolts.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
say
how
many
he
handed
out,
but
he
handed
out
those
thunderbolts.
now,
the
thunderbolt
is
filled
with
the
same
venom,
the
same
agitation,
the
same
of
invitation
to
disorder
and
riot
of
that
was
foretold
in
the
handbill.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
and
--
and
they
put
over
the
ideas,
they
did
the
damage,
they
did
what
they
set
out
to
do,
they
did
what
they
were
enjoined
from
doing,
if
the
court
please.
that
--
that's
the
(inaudible).
this
--
the
substance
of
the
--
of
the
thunderbolt
before
you,
i
don't
suppose
and
need
me
go
into
it,
i'll
be
glad
to
direct
your
attention
to
(inaudible).
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes.
so
--
so
that's
our
--
that's
our
theory
about
this
meeting.
we
say
a
meeting
was
here
because
that
the
ideas
were
put
across
by
communication.
it
was
not
in
word
but
it
was
in
writing
and
the
damage
was
done.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
approach
the
other
angle
of
the
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
--
at
this
time.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
it's
our
holding
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
depart
from
the
principle
that
an
injunction
issued
by
a
court
having
general
jurisdiction
with
equity
powers
in
which
your
--
they're
--
jurisdictions
has
been
aroused
or
raised
by
a
proper
application
and
in
which
the
parties
are
before
the
court
and
the
subject
matter
is
before
the
court
that
the
court
is
not
--
this
court
is
not
going
to
see
it
in
such
an
event
that
the
persons
served
with
the
injunction
and
against
to
whom
the
injunction
or
is
--
is
directed
don't
have
to
in
--
or
to
obey
the
injunction
if
they
believe
in
their
minds
that
it
--
that
the
--
the
thing
enjoined
or
the
act
of
injunction
or
the
--
the
laws
out
of
what
the
injunction
comes
are
unconstitutional
or
affect
their
first
amendment
rights
or
any
other
rights.
to
us,
that
is
a
dangerous
proposition
that
is
urged
upon
the
court
here
because
to
us,
it
appears
that
you
are
then
saying
to
each
man
or
each
person,
you
be
the
judge
of
whether
or
not
--
of
what
is
the
law.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
reserved
to
itself
the
question
of
what
is
the
law
and
to
say
to
a
person
that
he
or
she
may
decide
for
himself
what
is
the
law
is
to
an
effect,
make
no
law.
to
carry
that
reasoning
on,
the
criminal
might
say,
“well,
this
criminal
law
in
its
--
in
this
particular
situation
that
i
find
myself
is
inapplicable
to
me
and
i
will
go
ahead
and
break
the
law.”
we
have
anarchy
but
we
have
no
law.
now,
this
--
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
deciding
this
case
or
--
or
decided
it
on
the
basis
of
the
mine
workers
case.
it
also
decided,
as
was
mentioned
here,
on
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
certiorari.
it
was
--
the
matter
was
before
them
on
certiorari,
that
in
certiorari,
it
would
only
go
into
the
question
of
law,
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court.
of
course
that
involved
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
were
sufficient
facts
to
uphold
the
finding
of
--
of
contempt
and
the
court
said
that
in
its
judgment
there
was.
so
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
to
your
honors,
to
the
court
here
that
the
finding
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
is
appealed
to
this
court
was
based
on
these
two
propositions
of
general
law
and
not
upon
a
proposition
involving
a
federal
question,
either
of
interpretation
of
the
federal
constitution
or
the
interpretation
of
federal
statutes.
and
that
--
therefore,
under
the
authority
of
lee
versus
thomas,
lee
versus
thomas
which
said
that
the
general
well
settled
rule
is
that
the
case
coming
from
a
state
--
any
case
coming
from
a
state
court,
the
supreme
court
can
consider
only
federal
questions
and
it
can
entertain
--
it
cannot
entertain
the
case
unless
the
decision
was
against
the
--
the
plaintiff
and
they
are
on
these
questions.
and
that
is
further
been
applied
in
cases
where
it
was
said
that
if
--
if
the
finding
of
the
court
is
based
upon
several
propositions
of
one
of
which
is
a
proposition
of
general
law
not
involving
a
federal
question
and
if
that
proposition
standing
alone
which
supports
the
finding
of
the
court
and
that
this
court
would
not
entertain
the
question.
we
suggest
that
that
--
for
that
reason,
the
court
should
leave
the
findings
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
where
it
is.
now,
we
further
urge
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
no,
i
don't
have
to
contend,
i
say
that
it
was
not
considered
or
--
or
that
at
least
it
was
not
the
basis
of
determination
of
those
questions,
not
the
basis
of
a
finding
of
court,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
the
court
to
further
consider
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir.
it
would
seem
to
me
if
we
--
in
other
words
that
--
that
in
--
in
order
for
--
for
orderly
of
--
government,
orderly
administration
recourse
to
proceed
and
--
and
continue,
they
would
have
to
obey
it
and
--
and
use
the
appellate
practices
and
provisions
made
in
the
various
codes
to
contest
it.
a
mention
was
made
here
of
the
fact
that
the
alabama
code
provides
for
hearing
to
dissolve
an
injunction
on
10
days
notice
and
if
--
and
you
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
on
three
days
notice
if
the
court
is
in
session
at
that
time
and
have
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
on
the
question
of
whether
an
injunction
should
not
be
dissolved.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes
sir,
except
for
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
sir,
we
are,
of
course,
again,
as
we
are
in
this
case
all
the
way
around,
in
a
position
of
beginning
and
ending
of
rights.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
now,
where
--
where
rights
begin
with
one
and
the
other
end
and
the
others
begin.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
where
–
we’re
at
question,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
--
that
the
--
we
--
we've
got
their
question
of
whether
or
not
the
misuse
of
the
power
in
the
instance
you
speak
of
that
justifies
the
departure
from
the
orderly
procedures
of
the
court.
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
way,
which
is
more
important.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
it
must
be
obeyed
and
--
and
attacked
in
an
orderly
manner
and
not
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir
that's
our
position.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
it
would
be
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
it
would
be
my
hope
that
your
honor
would
come
back
to
the
mine
workers.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
however,
i
would
say
this
that
green,
as
i
--
as
i
read
it
and
as
i
recall
it
here,
the
--
the
court
found,
who
was
defendant
there,
because
the
defendant
was
not
given
a
hearing.
the
hearing
is
set,
i
think,
was
only
to
determine
the
punishment
in
that
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty.
i
believe
that
was
a
factor
there,
perhaps,
the
deciding
factor,
at
least
i
got
that
impression.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
i
still
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
something
(inaudible)
situation
is.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
your
honor,
i
think
to
do
other
wise
is
to
--
is
to
start
a
--
a
process
of
reasoning
that
can
lead
to
equally
ridiculous
ends.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
i'd
say
--
i'd
say
--
i
think
that
it
would
not
carry
that
far
because
it
--
i
know
that
in
--
from
my
own
personal
knowledge,
in
fairfield,
the
judgment
issues
such
a
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
--
wouldn't
be
reelected.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
and
i
think
that
is
a
factor
in
these
things,
too,
this
question
of
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well
your
honor,
i
just
don't
believe
that
this
--
that
that
--
i
just
don't
believe
this
(inaudible)
goes
to
the
extreme
that
your
honor
puts
forward
there.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
i
think
so.
it
would
be
consistent
about
the
matter.
i'd
also
like
for
the
court
to
consider
the
--
the
--
another
right
that
is
involved
here
and
that
is
the
right
of
the
people
involved
in
the
city
to
enjoy
--
peacefully
enjoy
their
homes
and
to
enjoy
the
use
of
the
streets
without
molestation
of
this
handbill
and
the
--
and
the
paper.
it
seems
to
me
your
design
to
stir
up,
uphold
one
portion
of
the
population
or
a
hot-headed
portion
of
the
population
against
another
portion
of
the
population
or
the
city
fathers
certainly
felt
so.
the
circuit
court
trying
the
case
thought
so.
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
thought
so
sincerely
and
the
city
fathers
felt
thinking
that,
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
head
it
off,
to
head
off
a
--
a
--
this
agitation
of
this
effort
to
support
peace
and
good
order
in
our
city
or
to
have
waited
until
after
the
meeting
it
take
--
take
in
this
course
and
the
(inaudible)
its
effect
and
routing
took
place
in
the
streets,
would
have
been
to
lock
the
barn
after
the
horse
was
gone.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
about
16,000,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir,
contiguous
with
birmingham,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir,
investment
cutoff,
investment
cutoff
being
a
division
of
a
county
which
has
a
separate
court
house
and
separate
judges
sitting
there.
for
the
things
you
just
asserted
just
the
same,
mr.
justice,
based
on
my
ideas.
we
--
we
earnestly
submit
that
the
--
there
was
evidence
to
justify
the
finding
of
contempt
and
we
earnestly
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
action
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
the
state
ground?
yes,
sir.
two
grounds,
your
honor,
one,
that
there
is
an
injunction
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
what
happened
to
parties
before
it
and
that
before
it
is
--
should
obey
it
and
resort
to
orderly
appeal
procedures
to
upset
it
or
to
test
it
to
that
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
i
think
it's
more
general
law,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
i
think
its
federal
law,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
i
mean
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
statute.
it's
not
a
--
it's
common
law,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
my
point
is
common
law.
then
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
sir.
it's
been
the
other
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
i
thought
it
was
if
my
interpretation
of
it
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes.
the
second
one
would
be
that
on
--
on
certiorari,
which
this
was
in
alabama
supreme
court,
the
court
only
goes
with
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
found
the
man
in
contempt,
which,
of
course,
would
include
the
question
of
whether
there
was
enough
evidence.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
on
--
on
appeal?
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
on
appeal?
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
on
certiorari,
it
means
your
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
well,
appeal
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes,
that's
--
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
yes.
the
--
that
wasn't
--
he
is
--
he
is
appealing
the
contempt
finding.
now,
his
testing
of
the
injunction
would
have
been
by
appeal
but
the
--
which
--
which
we
say
he
should
have
not.
now,
instead
of
thinking
--
instead
of
just
ignoring
the
injunction,
he
should
have
appealed
it.
that's
where
we
say
the
--
he
went
astray,
he
went
wrong.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
he
had
the
right
of
appeal.
mr.
frank
b.
parsons
