mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
to
review
determination
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
which
affirmed
a
criminal
conviction,
a
conviction
for
criminal
contempt
in
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county,
alabama.
individual
appellants,
lyons
and
fields,
were
sentenced
to
five
days
in
jail
and
were
fined
$50
apiece.
the
case
raises
two
constitutional
questions.
one,
whether
the
city
of
fairfield
may
use
the
power
of
the
injunction
to
suppress
in
advance
the
enjoinment
of
first
amendment
rights
in
order
to
preserve
its
conception
of
the
status
quo.
the
case
is
a
direct
successor
to
the
long
line
of
cases
which
this
court
has
--
in
which
this
court
has
spelled
out
the
crucial
part
played
by
freedom
of
speech
in
the
development
of
political
liberty
in
the
united
states.
there
is
the
second
question
relating
to
the
thompson
v.
louisville
point
whether
or
not
the
record
is
so
devoid
of
evidence
that
the
conviction
must
fall.
the
facts
are
these.
the
individual
appellants
are
officers
of
the
national
states
rights
party.
the
party
which
has
appeared
on
the
ballot
in
several
states
stands
for
white
supremacy.
appellants
announced
that
a
meeting
was
to
be
held
in
fairfield,
alabama
on
october
11,
1961.
they
distributed
leaflets
announcing
a
meeting
which
stated
in
effect
that
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was
to
advocate
racial
segregation
in
schools,
recreation
facilities
and
labor
unions.
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
not
on
the
streets,
not
in
the
parks,
it
was
to
be
held
in
a
private
hall
and
it
was
a
public
meeting
to
which
the
public
was
invited.
the
day
before
the
meeting
was
to
be
held,
the
mayor
of
fairfield
learned
that
the
meeting
has
been
announced
and
that
handbills
have
been
distributed
announcing
the
meeting.
he
therefore
sent
a
notice
to
appellant
fields
telling
him
that
he
had
violated
two
ordinances
of
the
city
of
fairfield,
which
together
flatly
prohibited
the
distribution
of
any
leaflets,
pamphlets,
or
any
kind
of
literature
at
all
on
the
streets
or
any
other
public
way
in
the
city.
and
that
by
announcing
that
this
meeting
was
to
be
held
the
next
night,
he
had
violated
another
city
ordinance
which
require
that
before
any
public
meeting
be
held,
a
permit
be
obtained
from
the
mayor
of
fairfield
and
fields
has
not
made
application
for
this
permit.
in
the
course
of
that
day
which
was
the
day
before
the
meeting
was
scheduled,
appellant
fields
and
the
mayor
had
two
phone
calls
which
were
inconclusive,
but
they
came
to
some
kind
of
agreement
that
fields
would
go
to
the
mayor's
office
the
next
day
at
about
2
o'clock
in
order
to
discuss
it
further.
the
next
morning,
however,
the
city
of
fairfield
went
into
circuit
court
with
a
bill
of
complaint
and
alleged
that
the
appellants
had
called
a
public
meeting
for
that
evening,
had
announced
the
meeting
by
distributing
handbills
i
quote,
from
the
bill
of
complaint,
"by
distributing
handbills
of
an
inflammatory
nature
designed
to
create
ill-will
and
disturbances
between
the
races."
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
handbills
have
been
distributed
in
violation
of
the
two
city
ordinance
referred
to
and
that
no
permit
have
been
obtained
for
the
meeting
that
has
been
announced.
the
compliant
also
alleged
that
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was,
"to
create
tension,
ill-will,
disturbances
and
disorderly
conduct
between
the
races",
and
that
it
is,
"calculated
to
create
a
disturbance,
incite
to
riot,
disturb
the
peace,
and
disrupt
--
disrupt
peace
and
good
order
in
the
city
of
fairfield
that
would
constitute
a
public
nuisance
injurious
to
the
health,
comfort,
or
welfare
of
the
city
and
its
inhabitants."
the
court
issued
the
injunction
forthwith
ex
parte,
no
notice
to
the
appellants
here,
no
notice
of
fields
or
its
alliance
or
to
any
officials
of
the
national
states
rights
party.
he
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
enjoined
the
appellants
from
holding
their
announced
public
meeting
and
from
further
distribution
of
handbills,
"such
as
were
distributed
fairfield
on
october
10,
1961."
and
the
same
order,
he
set
down
a
hearing
on
the
application
for
affirmative
injunction
for
november
17,
which
was
more
than
a
month
after
the
date
of
the
meeting
had
originally
been
set
forth.
the
appellants
here
fields
and
--
fields
was
served
with
the
temporary
restraining
order
on
noon
of
the
day
that
the
meeting
was
supposed
to
be
held.
the
meeting
was
supposed
to
be
held
at
8
p.m.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
a
suburban.
it's
an
industrial
u.s.
steel
town,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
its
just
outside
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
just
outside
of
birmingham.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
in
jefferson
county.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
this
was
the
circuit
court
which
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
(voice
overlap)
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
general
jurisdiction
with
equity.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
evening,
that
is
the
evening
of
the
meeting
after
the
tro
had
been
served
on
fields,
the
appellants
were
arrested
outside
the
place
where
the
meeting
had
been
scheduled
have
been
held
--
to
be
held.
they
were
arrested
for
violating
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
there
was
a
--
they
were
jailed
overnight
and
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
the
contempt
the
next
day
and
appellants
were
convicted
and
sentenced
as
i
say
to
five
days
in
jail,
$50
fine.
now,
the
evidence
from
the
hearing,
all
of
which
is
in
the
record
and
it
was
not
very
long,
shows
three
facts
without
any
dispute
whatsoever.
most
of
--
most
of
the
facts
were
established
by
the
prosecution's
witnesses
as
a
matter
of
fact.
one,
that
they
had
not
held
the
meeting,
two,
that
there
was
no
distribution
of
handbills
announcing
the
meeting
after
the
tro
was
served,
and
three,
that
there
was
no
disturbance
whatsoever.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
as
against
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
was
against
the
specific
announced
meeting.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
your
honor.
the
evidences
which
i'll
just
briefly
review,
was
that
fields
and
lyons
had
indeed
gone
to
the
place
where
the
meeting
was
scheduled
to
be
held.
but
they
have
done
so
in
order
to
tell
anybody
who
might
have
intended
to
attend
that
it
had
been
transferred
to
the
city
park
in
lipscomb,
alabama
which
was
a
town
not
far
away.
and
fields
testified
that
he
had
gotten
the
permission
of
the
mayor
of
lipscomb
to
hold
the
meeting
in
the
city
park.
and
fields
testified
that
he
had
no
intention
whatever
of
violating
the
injunction.
but
as
i
say
had
gone
there
merely
to
notify
people
that
the
meeting
was
transferred.
he
said
there
were
about
10
to
12
people
there
and
that
he
told
all
of
them
that
the
meeting
was
at
--
at
--
at
lipscomb
that
he
didn't
distribute
any
handbills,
but
he
did
distribute
a
few
copies
of
the
party
newspaper
thunderbolt,
the
copies
which
is
in
the
record.
everything
that
fields
said
was
corroborated
by
the
city
police
who
were
the
prosecution's
witnesses.
one
officer
pope
stated
there
wasn't
any
disturbance
and
the
conditions
were
peaceful.
another
officer
meisel
who
actually
effected
the
arrest
of
field
and
lyons
testified
that,
"there
was
no
meeting
held."
and
that
he
saw
no
leaflets
being
distributed.
the
only
thing
he
saw
distributed
was
the
thunderbolt,
the
party
newspaper.
the
chief
police
didn't
see
any
leaflets
passed
out
other
than
the
thunderbolt.
so
there
--
it
was
not
disputed
that
there
wasn't
any
meeting,
that
there
weren't
any
handbills
passed
out
but
nonetheless,
the
appellants
were
held
in
contempt
violating
the
temporary
restraining
order.
and
the
reasons
given
by
the
trial
court
he
said
--
well
he
said
that
there
--
there
was
no
evidence
the
pamphlet
was
distributed
but
he
was
impressed,
"by
the
tone
and
context
of
the
newspaper,
the
ones
they
distributed,
and
he
thought
that
it
was
a
--
an
artifice
on
the
part
of
someone
to
bring
home
to
the
fact
that
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
held."
he
didn't
say
anything
all
about
that
whether
or
not
the
meeting
was
held.
he
just
ignored
that.
he
said
the
ordinances
were
legal
exercise
of
police
power
in
a
municipality
and
he
explained
what
--
and
he
said
he
also
didn't
think
that
there
are
collateral,
he
could
challenge
the
constitutionality
ordinances
by
collateral
attack.
he
said
very
interestingly
enough,
he
said,
"it's
the
intention
i
know
of
the
public
officials
both
--
both
of
this
county
and
of
the
various
municipalities
of
this
--
of
the
bessemer
division
of
this
county",
and
we're
going
to
everything
we
can,
"to
maintain
the
status
quo."
he
referred
to
a
movement
into
one
of
our
public
parks
several
years
ago
but
that
was
straightened
out
with
a
matter
of
a
few
weeks
by
the
city
attorney.
on
appeal
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
convictions
were
affirmed
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
findings
that
they
violated
the
terms
of
the
temporary
injunction
in
--
in
both
respects
and
that
it
only
spoke
of
one
ordinance,
in
the
singular,
it
said
we
cannot
say
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
but
doesn't
say
which
ordinance
it
refers
to.
but
its
judgment
in
effect
went
off
on
the
(inaudible)
ground
that
the
order
disobeyed
was
not
void,
and
citing
united
states
versus
united
mine
workers
held
that
one
may
not
raise
a
question
of
unconstitutionality
and
collateral
proceedings
on
appeal
for
a
judgment
of
conviction
for
contempt
of
the
order
decreed
or
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
for
release
from
imprisonment
before
contempt.
in
other
words,
what
he
was
saying
was
that,
if
you
want
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinances
and
injunction,
you
have
to
do
it
on
orderly
appellate
--
what
--
it's
--
what
it
said
was
the
orderly
appellate
processes.
and
that
you
could
not
flout
the
order
of
the
court
and
get
a
determination
growing
out
of
the
contempt
conviction.
that
i
think
is
the
issue
here.
the
question,
therefore,
is
whether
the
appellant
is
pain
right
to
exercise,
enjoy
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
assembly
which
are
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
can
be
suppressed
by
rule
of
law
which
forbids
appellants
from
challenging
unconstitutional
grounds,
and
indisputably
frivolous
injunction
based
upon
in
this
unarguably
unconstitutional
ordinances
whether
they
can
be
--
whether
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--
whether
--
whether
these
clearly
unconstitutional
ordinances
and
injunction
cannot
be
tested
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
related
them
yesterday,
the
question
that's
presented
to
the
court
now
for
its
decision
is
whether
the
appellants'
plain
right
to
exercise
and
enjoy
their
first
amendment
rights
of
speech
and
assembly
can
be
suppressed
in
advance
by
an
injunction,
the
worst
kind
of
prior
restraint.
we
think
it
begs
the
question
to
talk
about
this
case
in
terms
of
the
mine
workers
case
which
was
the
ostensible
basis
for
the
alabama
supreme
court's
injunction
decision
and
we
think
that
it
also
begs
the
question
to
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
the
concepts
that
have
flowed
from
the
mine
workers
case
such
as
the
jurisdiction
--
to
determine
jurisdiction,
void
orders,
substance
of
void
orders,
frivolous
void
orders
and
all
the
rest.
we
think
these
are
all
irrelevant
where
first
amendment
rights
are
asserted.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
very
little
is
left
under
the
case,
your
honor.
the
rule
of
law
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
in
this
case
is
that
essentially,
that
the
first
amendment
simply
will
not
tolerate
injunctions
against
political
speech
and
political
assembly.
now,
in
the
way
this
case
comes
up
to
this
court,
it
comes
in
a
novel
context.
and
although
it
is
novel
in
this
case,
in
--
at
this
stage
of
our
history,
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
there's
been
a
proliferation
of
the
use
of
injunctions
of
this
sort,
temporary
restraining
orders
against
speech
and
that
other
cases
that
raise
the
same
question
promised
to
come
before
this
court.
now,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
dramatically
--
excuse
me
--
demonstrate
why
the
rule
that
we
urge
can
and
ought
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
the
injunction
which
the
appellants
are
held
to
have
violated
and
of
which
they
were
convicted
was
based
on
three
local
ordinances
of
the
city
of
fairfield
and
we
can
discuss
this
very
quickly,
i
think.
two
of
them,
together,
constituted
a
flat
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
leaflets,
handbills
and
any
other
kind
of
literature
in
the
public
streets
and
in
the
--
all
the
public
portions
of
the
city
of
fairfield.
this
wasn't
a
permit
requirement
which
would
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
well,
this
was
a
flat
prohibition
and
lovell
v.
griffin,
jamison,
talley,
all
of
them,
together,
make
this
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
its
face
indisputably.
the
other
ordinance
that
was
--
that
which
--
which
was
the
basis
for
the
injunction
in
this
case
was
one
that
required
a
permit
from
the
mayor
in
order
to
hold
a
public
meeting.
now,
this
ordinance,
based
on
the
(inaudible)
in
kansas
also
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
clearly
so.
it
has
no
standards
in
it
as
those
two
cases
require,
nor
have
any
judicial
standards
been
imported
into
the
case,
so
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
moreover,
it's
unconstitutional
as
applied
in
this
case
because
it
was
applied
not
against
the
meeting
that
was
to
be
held
in
a
public
street
or
in
a
public
park.
it
was
applied
against
the
meeting
that
was
to
be
held
in
a
private
hall
in
fairfield,
private
hall
that
had
no
connection
at
all
with
the
--
with
the
municipality.
and
we
assert
that
the
state
or
local
municipality
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
require
that
a
permit
be
applied
for
before
any
individual
or
any
group
seeks
to
hold
a
meeting
in
a
private
auditorium.
although
the
context
is
different,
it
is
as
if
somebody
who
wanted
to
hold
the
political
meeting
in
carnegie
hall
would
have
to
ask
for
permit
from
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
or
from
the
police
commissioner,
i
think
it's
unthinkable.
so,
the
three
ordinances
that
are
involved
in
this
case
and
which
were
the
basis
for
the
injunction
or
i
think
without
dispute
unconstitutional
on
their
faces.
the
appellee
seems
to
have
conceded
this
and
the
government's
amicus
curiae
makes
this
--
grants
likewise.
we
then
come
to
the
injunction
which
was
based
on
these
three
indisputably
unconstitutional
ordinances
and
i
suggest
that
on
the
basis
of
near
versus
minnesota
particularly
and
from
other
sound
constitutional
principles
from
cases
in
which
the
questions
of
reason
and
been
articulated
by
this
court
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
speech,
that
political
speech,
political
assembly
cannot
be
enjoined
in
advance.
if
any
description
at
all
can
describe
the
effect
of
such
an
injunction
on
speech,
i
think
that
it
must
be
described
as
the
most
pernicious
kind
of
prior
restraint
and
this
court
has
condemned
prior
restraints
over
and
over
again.
now,
this
isn't
a
--
an
abstract
right
that
is
the
right
to
be
able
to
speech
freely
without
prior
restraints
because
as
this
court
has
said
and
as
many
people
have
recognized
over
and
over
again,
speech
and
assembly
in
our
nation
is
the
very
foundation
of
the
nation.
it
is
upon
the
right
of
speech
and
assembly
that
all
of
our
political
activity
rests.
it
is
upon
speech
and
assembly
that
the
determinations
about
how
society
is
to
be
ordered
rests
and
if
political
speech
and
political
assembly
can
be
enjoined
in
advance,
then
i
fear
that
the
very
firm
foundation
of
the
first
amendment
will
be
seriously
weakened.
i
think
it's
instructive
to
point
out
several
of
the
--
several
examples
which
we
have
in
our
brief
about
the
way
in
which
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
injunctions
have
--
have
been
invoked
in
very
recent
times
against
speech.
and
this
case,
as
well
as
these
examples
which
i
set
out,
i
think
will
persuade
the
court
that
any
injunction
issued
or
temporary
restraining
order
issued
against
speech
and
assembly
can,
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
mine
workers
case,
be
treated
as
if
it
were
nothing
other
than
alluded
to
the
newspaper
and
can
be
disregarded
with
impunity.
now,
in
our
case,
the
ordinances
on
which
the
injunction
was
based
are
unarguably
unconstitutional.
the
injunction
itself
is
unarguably
unconstitutional
as
a
prior
restraint
that
is
based
on
unconstitutional
ordinances.
if
the
face
of
all
this,
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
that
the
ordinance
that
the
injunction
must
be
obeyed
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
and
what
they
were
saying
in
effect
was
that
no
matter
how
unconstitutional
the
injunction
is
that
these
appellants
must
pay
sterile
homage
and
it
was
nothing
more
than
that
to
a
court
order
which
was
not
a
court
order
but
which
was
mere
usurpation
of
the
court's
power.
there
are
other
examples,
at
page
30
in
our
brief,
of
temporary
restraining
orders
which
courts
have
in
the
past
year
or
so
all
over
the
country,
not
merely
in
alabama,
not
merely
in
the
south
but
in
california
and
new
york
in
which
courts
have
issued
temporary
restraining
orders,
ground
was
temporary
restraining
orders,
to
enjoin
in
two
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
note
15.
the
distribution
of
political
literature
in
the
california
gubernatorial
campaign
in
1962,
one
judge
issued
tro
against
the
distribution
of
some
literature
which
suggested
that
governor
brown
and
the
other
democratic
incumbents
were
sought
on
communism
and
another
judge
issued
a
restraining
order
prohibiting
the
distribution
of
two
pamphlets
which
were
critical
of
--
of
mr.
nixon.
and
the
tros
were
issued
before
the
--
before
election
day
as
i
understand
it
they
were
obeyed
and
several
days
after
election,
each
of
the
complaining
parties
went
into
the
court
and
asked
that
the
tros
be
dissolved
and
they
were.
and
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
moot,
your
honor,
i
believe.
this
was
--
this
were
the
complainants
themselves
who
went
into
--
complaints
were
gotten
the
tro
went
back
to
court
and
asked
that
they
be
dissolved.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
and
in
new
york,
a
judge
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
prohibiting
the
appearance
of
herbert
aptheker
at
the
university
of
buffalo
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
national
committee
of
the
communist
party
and
this
was
at
a
forum
at
university
of
buffalo,
where
such
diverse
people
as
oswald
mosley
from
england
and
(inaudible)
thomas
from
new
york
had
spoken
freely
as
they
probably
should.
and
--
but
once
they
--
when
the
tro
was
issued
against
aptheker,
he
defied
to
speak.
the
board
of
trustees
refused
to
allow
him
to
speak
and
that
case
is
now
on
appeal
in
the
new
york
courts.
and
there
are
other
cases
cited
in
the
footnote
and
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
naacp
amicus
brief
which
is
filed
in
this
case
which
give
other
examples
of
the
same
kind
of
use
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
to
interfere
with
constitutionally
protected
activity.
and
again,
the
pernicious
thing
about
it
is
that
in
a
normal
case,
as
far
as
i
know
in
every
case
except
this
case,
the
defendants
against
to
whom
the
tros
run
have
acquiesced
in
these
because
they
believe
that
if
they
violate
them,
they
will
be
subject
to
criminal
contempt
convictions
and
will
not
be
able
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
tro.
so
that
the
effect
of
the
proliferation
of
the
use
of
these
kinds
of
court
orders
has
had
a
very
serious
and
substantial
effect
on
--
and
has
impaired
the
rights
of
free
speech
in
a
wide
variety
of
context.
and
in
the
case
at
bar,
although
the
bill
of
complaint
alleged
that
the
reason
that
this
meeting
or
to
be
enjoined
was
because
its
purpose
was
to
create
tension,
ill
will
disturbances
and
disorderly
conduct
between
the
races
and
that
would
be
a
public
nuisance
injurious
to
the
health,
comfort
or
welfare
of
the
city
of
fairfield
and
would
create
a
disturbance,
incite
a
riot,
et
cetera.
it
just
so
happens
that
the
evening
before
this
meeting
was
scheduled,
the
appellant,
national
states
rights
party
had
held
another
meeting
in
fairfield
which
was
perfectly
peaceful
at
which
the
public
attended
without
any
question
whatsoever
of
disorder.
and
there
was
no
basis
in
the
present
bill
of
complaint
for
the
city
to
go
into
court
to
say
that
there
were
--
there
was
a
danger
of
inciting
to
riot
and
disruptions
of
peace
and
good
order.
the
fact
that
they
also
said
it
wasn't
going
to
create
tension,
ill-will,
et
cetera,
is
not,
of
course,
by
itself
any
grounds
whatsoever
upon
which
to
interfere
with
the
speech
and
the
trial
court,
of
course,
gave
the
real
reason
why
this
tro
had
been
issued.
he
said
that,
they
in
that
county,
“we're
going
to
do
everything
they
could
to
maintain
the
status
quo.”
so
they
weren't
fearful
of
disorder.
they
were
not
fearful
of
any
kind
of
disorderly
conduct.
they
were
just
fearful
that
the
status
quo
was
going
to
be
disrupted,
but
certainly,
that's
no
basis
whatsoever
on
which
to
enjoin
a
meeting.
professor
paul
floyd
had
said
in
a
little
excerpt
from
--
that
we
have
in
our
brief,
he
speaks
of
the
chilling
effect
that
injunctions
have
in
first
amendment
rights
and
he
says
it
particularly
obtains,
if
disobedience
of
the
interim
order
is
ipso
facto
contempt
with
no
opportunity
to
escape
by
showing
invalidity
of
the
order
on
its
merits.
and
as
i
say,
there
has
been
a
chilling
effect
on
political
liberty
in
the
united
states
because
of
these
tros
in
a
large
number
of
different
cases.
and
of
course,
if
the
appellants
here
rather
than
having
been
enjoined
in
advance
by
the
circuit
court
had
been
prosecuted
directly
under
the
ordinances
which
were
the
basis
for
the
injunction,
there's
no
question
whatsoever
that
if
convicted,
their
convictions
would
necessarily
have
been
reversed
if
it
were
necessary
as
it
may
well
have
been
to
have
brought
those
criminal
cases
to
this
court.
certainly,
since
stau
and
prior
to
stau,
they
could
have
tested
the
constitutionality
of
these
ordinances
by
violating
them
and
could
have
raised
as
a
defense
in
a
criminal
prosecution
the
ordinances'
unconstitutionality.
so,
the
crux
of
the
denial
in
this
case
is
that
the
right
to
enjoin
your
first
amendment
rights
was
delayed
because
i
think
that
that
right
is
an
immediate
right
and
that
its
delay
is
tantamount
to
its
denial.
and
that
the
only
way
to
exercise
that
right
immediately,
as
one
ought
to
be
able
to
do,
is
to
violate
an
unconstitutional
and
oppressive
court
order,
again,
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
order
that's
no
different
than
a
letter
to
a
newspaper,
then
that
route
must
be
allowed.
and
of
course,
the
appellee
speaks
about
the
possibility
of
disorder
or
violence
or
incitement
to
violence,
but
that
was
mere
speculation.
they
--
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
going
to
be
any
outbreak
of
violence,
can
be
based
on
the
meeting
held
just
the
previous
evening
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
perfectly
peaceful.
so
simply
by
it's
asserting
that
there
was
a
speculative
possibility
and
very
remote
at
that
of
disorder,
they
--
they
still
did
not
justify
at
all
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
he
could've
done
in
it
in
this
proceeding,
justice
black,
because
with
the
next
party
proceeding
without
notice
to
the
appellants,
but
if
they
were
going
to
do
it
on
notice
with
a
hearing
in
which
they
are
going
to
present
evidence,
my
argument
would
be
no
different.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
they
were
going
to
present
it.
if
they
were
going
to
--
if
they
were
going
to
try
to
enjoin
and
on
notice
with
a
hearing
and
present
evidence
of
this
kind,
my
position
would
be
no
different.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
my
position
would
still
be
no
different,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
alabama
supreme
court
pointed
to
--
based
their
decision
upon
the
decision
of
mine
workers,
the
rule
of
law
enunciated
mine
workers
and
as
we
have
said,
we
don't
believe
that
mine
workers
really
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
suggested,
in
re
green
last
term
or
the
term
before,
i
think
it
has
seriously
impaired
the
authority
of
that
case.
and
there
were
earlier
cases,
the
gas
and
coke
workers
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
allowed
state
injunctions
to
be
--
to
be
violative.
and
mine
workers,
of
course,
is
entirely
different
case
because
it
had
to
do
with
the
assertion
of
rights
that
were
--
could
be
regulated
by
statute.
it
concerned
a
very,
very
complex
problem
of
statutory
interpretation,
namely,
whether
the
norris-la
guardia
act
applied
in
the
situation
where
the
government
stood
in
the
role
of
the
employer
or
owner
or
what
have
you
and
third,
of
course,
it
was
in
the
context
of
an
industrial
dispute.
but
we
think
even
in
mine
workers
own
terms
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
give
any
credence
to
the
--
to
the
mine
workers'
rule,
that
of
the
seven
--
that
of
the
nine
justices
that
sat
on
the
case,
seven
of
them
recognized
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
an
order
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
called
a
frivolous
void
order
as
opposed
to
a
substantial
void
order
that
could
be
violated
with
impunity.
seven
of
the
justices
said
there
was
such
--
such
an
order.
justices
black
and
justice
douglas
did
not
because
they
didn't
think
it
was
right
for
discussion
in
that
particular
case,
but
if
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
frivolously
void
order,
this
order
is
it.
it
was
an
order
issued
upon
three
unarguably
unconstitutional
ordinances.
it
was
a
prior
restraint.
it
was
in
the
context
of
the
impairment
of
first
amendments
rights
which
stand
high
in
our
social
order
and
whatever
assertion
of
jurisdiction
that
the
circuit
court
made
was
entirely
frivolous.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
question
here
of
his
having
to
--
have
time
to
determine
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
and
the
appellee
again
suggests
that,
well,
this
was
alright
because
if
he
had
followed
the
orderly
appellant
procedures,
he
could've
gotten
--
he
moved
to
quash
in
the
--
in
the
alabama
circuit
court,
he
could've
gotten
a
--
if
his
motion
to
quash
was
denied
and
if
he
took
a
prompt
appeal
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
he
might
have
had
this
determination
within
a
minimum,
a
minimum
of
13
days
assuming
that
both
courts
would
decide
the
--
well,
assuming
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
decided
the
matter
off
the
bench.
i
suggest
there
might
be
more
than
that,
but
in
any
case
even
if
it
was
a
day,
this
would
be
14
days
after
the
meeting
was
originally
scheduled,
but
even
if
it
were
a
day,
i
say
that
this
delay
is
tantamount
to
a
denial.
our
last
point
is
that
this
is
another
one
of
those
cases
like
thompson
v.
louisville
and
carter
versus
louisiana,
where
the
record
is
so
devoid
of
evidence
that
the
conviction
cannot
stand
and
i
think
the
record
speaks
so
clearly
for
itself
on
that
point
and
i
spoke
to
him
yesterday
when
i
was
reviewing
the
facts
of
the
case
that
i
will
rest
on
the
--
on
our
brief
as
well
as
the
government's
brief
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
only
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
and
that
is
the
last
one
raised
about
the
adequate
state
ground.
of
course,
i
understand
that
doctrine
of
preliminary
to
determination
whether
a
state
ground
is
adequate,
and
whether
it's
independent
of
the
federal
ground
and
i
think
it's
very
plain
here
that
this
is
not
the
case
and
with
the
court's
opinion
last
term
in
fay
versus
noia
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
a
different
kind
--
different
but
related
context
and
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
that
said
while
the
court
is
deferred
to
state
absolute
grounds
so
long
as
they're
are
not
taking
evasively
discriminatory
against
federal
rights.
and
sometimes
it's
used
to
differ
a
state
procedure
ground
only
because
they
made
burdens
in
the
vindication
of
federal
rights
and
i
think
that's
applied
with
the
case
here
that
the
so-called
rule
of
state
law
has
--
plays
such
a
heavy
burden
on
the
assertion
of
federal
rights
that
it
simply
cannot
be
brought
up
in
terms
of
being
either
independent
or
adequate
state
ground.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
if
there
was
a
wrong
route,
then
there
were
no
other
routes,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
--
well,
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
was
that
they
--
under
its
certiorari
procedure
it
would
only
undertake
to
review
the
law
and
not
the
facts.
and
they
said
that
this
would
also
include
the
question
of
whether
the
particular
order
appealed
from
was
void
on
its
face.
and
i
think,
it
could
have
examined
the
--
the
question
that
i'm
raising
here
under
its
certiorari
procedure
because
--
because
we're
claiming
that
it
was
void
on
its
face.
but
as
i
understand
the
alabama
procedure
in
a
matter
like
this,
if
it
isn't
certiorari
--
they
--
they
were
saying
that
in
effect
was
that
they
couldn't
really
raise
any
substantive
questions
at
all
on
the
--
on
the
certiorari
proceeding
(inaudible)
to
review
a
criminal
contempt
(voice
overlap).
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it's
--
it's
to
say
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
quote
from
its
own
opinion
in
naacp
versus
alabama
without
noting
that
it
had
been
reversed.
but
i
think
that
is
somewhat
different
because
what
this
court
said
in
naa
versus
alabama
was
that
this
was
a
rule
of
law
in
the
civil
contempt
context
that
the
naa
case
came
up
and
--
that
had
never
before
been
applied
and
that
the
petitioner
there
had
been
adequately
forewarned.
i
can
only
repeat
what
i've
already
said
that
the
appellees,
city
of
fairfield's
claim
that
all
they
were
doing
here
was
trying
to
maintain
the
peace
and
good
