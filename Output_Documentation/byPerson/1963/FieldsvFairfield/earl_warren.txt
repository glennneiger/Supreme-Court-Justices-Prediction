mr.

chief

finish
your

chief

chief
justice

warren
edward
r.
fields,
et
al.,
versus
city
of
mayfield
or
fairfield.
mr.
wulf,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
grounds
--
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
unconstitutional
or
the
grounds
that
it
was
moot?
which
was
it,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
large
was
the
crowd,
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
meeting
that
was
held,
do
you
say
it
was
held
with
the
consent
of
the
mayor
of
that
city,
he
authorized
it
to
be
held
in
a
public
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
40
of
the
52
people
that
we
know
were
there
were
police
officers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
parsons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
parsons,
would
it
interfere
with
your
--
your
argument
if
we
ask
you
to
address
yourself
to
the
point
that
the
attorney
general
has
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
freshen
our
mind
now
and
might
not
be
freshen
our
mind
when
you
get
into
the
other
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
it,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
leave
that,
mr.
parsons,
if
we
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
this
injunction
was
clearly
unconstitutional
and
i
suppose
you
can
--
we
can
all
imagine
an
injunction
that
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional,
if
we
assume
that,
would
they
still
have
to
obey
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
that
--
might
that
not
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
--
that
the
authorities
could
stop
any
kind
of
a
meeting
that
they
wanted
to
stop
without
any
--
any
hour
on
the
part
of
the
individual
with
a
group
to
--
to
have
their
meeting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
while
if
--
let's
--
let's
take
a
meeting
that
was
clearly
within
their
rights
and
a
judge
just
said,
“well,
you
can't
have
that
kind
--
kind
of
a
meeting,”
but
on
a
face
of
it,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
clearly
an
unconstitutional
act
on
his
--
his
part.
do
you
believe
that
they
--
they
must
still
obey
the
--
the
injunction
and
forego
their
--
their
meeting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
the
only
--
only
thing
i
want
to
know,
what
was
your
ultimate
position?
your
position
i
take
it
then
is,
no
matter
how
unconstitutional
an
injunction
is
that
it
must
be
obeyed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
can
only
be
--
only
be
attacked
by
the
appellate
process.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wulf.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
