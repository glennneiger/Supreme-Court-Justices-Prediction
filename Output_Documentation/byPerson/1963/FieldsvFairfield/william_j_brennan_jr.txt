in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
if
there
was
a
meeting,
it
was
some
meeting
in
an
hour
other
than
the
scheduled
meeting
and
it
was
only
the
scheduled
meeting
that
was
enjoined
and
your
suggestion
is
that
it
is
against
the
constitution
by
(inaudible).
it
ought
to
be
given
the
strict
interpretation
of
the
extent
of
the
injunction.

mr.
parsons,
i
really
--
i
wonder
if
you
really
mean
those
fuzz.
it's
just
--
i
take
it's
utterly
silly
situation
that
every
catholic
in
fairfield
on
a
saturday
night
is
enjoined
from
attending
mass
on
a
sunday
morning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
you
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
eyes
of
catholic
would
have
obeyed
them
and
now
they
attend
mass
in
sunday
mornings
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
do
it
in
appellate
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you'd
--
then
you
--
you're
telling
me
you
do
carry
it
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
not.
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
purposely
call
that
improbably.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
really
mean
that
no
matter
how
unconstitutionally
restrained
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
it
did,
you'd
say
i
have
to
obey
it.
