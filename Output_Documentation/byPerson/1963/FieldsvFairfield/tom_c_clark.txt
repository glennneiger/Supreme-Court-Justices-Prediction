your
position
is
that
prior
to
the
injunction,
before
he
was
served,
he
had
been
passing
out
the
handbills
and
that
the
handbills
said
to
come
to
this
particular
place
at
8
o'clock
on
that
same
day.
whereupon
he
was
served
with
the
injunction
that
he's
then
quit
passing
out
the
handbills
but
half
an
hour
before
the
meeting,
he
went
over,
you
say,
to
tell
the
people
that
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
held
in
a
different
place.

and
what
he
passed
out
was

which
had
none
--
no
reference
to
the
meeting.
