mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
most
of
mr.
wulf's
argument
in
this
case
raises
questions
that
the
court
need
consider
in
this
case
only
if
fields
disobeyed
the
order
that
was
issued
by
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county.
so
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
last
point
that
mr.
wulf
made
which
is
whether
or
not
fields
did
disobey
the
order
and
so
the
questions
and
problems
that
come
up
if
he
did
disobey
the
order
whether
those
are
really
before
the
court.
the
pleadings
in
this
case
alleged
that
fields
was
going
to
hold
a
specific
public
meeting
at
a
certain
address
in
fairfield
on
the
evening
of
october
11,
1961
and
that
that
meeting
had
been
announced
by
bills
which
were
been
flammatory
nature.
it
attached
the
copy
of
the
bill
which
appears
at
record
pages
3
and
4.
the
relief
that
was
sought
by
the
complaint
which
appears
at
record
3
was
to
enjoin
and
restrain
the
party
in
fields
from
holding
the
said
meeting
at
said
time
and
place
and
from
distributing
said
handbills
in
the
city
of
fairfield,
alabama.
that
was
the
relief
sought
by
the
restraining
order.
the
injunction
that
was
issued
was
in
those
narrow
terms,
that
appears
on
pages
5
and
6
of
the
record
and
was
there
a
restraining
order
from
--
against
fields
from
distributing
further
in
the
city
of
fairfield
handbills
announcing
such
meeting
until
further
orders
of
the
court
and
from
holding
the
meeting
as
announced.
the
complaint
did
also
allege
not
only
that
ordinances
existed
in
the
city
of
fairfield
prohibiting
the
distribution
of
handbills
and
the
holding
of
the
meeting
without
a
permit
but
also
as
mr.
wulf
has
said
that
the
meeting
was
among
other
things
calculated
to
create
a
disturbance,
incite
to
riot,
disturb
the
peace
and
disrupt
peace
in
good
order
in
the
city
of
fairfield.
the
judgment
of
contempt
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court,
which
appears
on
page
8
of
the
record,
did
not
make
any
findings
of
violation
of
the
specific
terms
of
the
order.
it
--
only
findings
were
in
conclusory
terms.
it
did
not
find
that
there
was
a
distribution
of
the
handbill
covered
by
the
order
and
it
did
not
find
that
the
meeting
was
held.
what
it
did
find
was
that
fields
and
lyons
knew
the
terms
of
the
injunction
and
willfully
and
contemptuously
distributed
literature
and
held
or
attempted
to
hold
said
meeting.
the
opening
statements
of
counsel
in
the
case
did
not
really
claim
that
a
violation
of
the
order
was
involved.
the
opening
statement
by
mr.
parsons
was
that
fields
and
lyons
came
to
the
vicinity
of
the
place
where
the
meeting
was
scheduled,
contacted
the
people
there
about
the
meeting
and
distributed
literature.
it
did
not
refer
to
having
a
meeting
and
it
did
not
refer
to
the
distribution
of
the
handbills.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
on
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
proof
consisted
of
four
witnesses
and
six
exhibits.
the
exhibits
were
a
copy
of
the
thunderbolt
which
was
the
literature
referred
to
and
that
appears
on
page
21
of
the
record,
a
rifled
slug
and
three
shotgun
shells
which
were
introduced,
though
they
don't
appear
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
contempt
and
a
copy
of
the
handbill
which
was
introduced
and
appears
at
page
42
of
the
record.
it
was
admitted,
it
is
admitted,
i
think,
that
that
handbill
was
not
distributed
after
the
injunction.
the
witnesses
were,
first,
chester
poke
who
is
a
member
of
the
fairfield
police
force.
he
testified
that
he
saw
fields
distributing
a
copy
--
copies
of
the
thunderbolt
in
the
vicinity
of
the
place
where
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
held
about
half
an
hour
before
it
was
going
to
be
held.
and
he
testified
that
fields
was
telling
the
people
that
were
there
that
the
meeting
place
had
been
changed
to
lipscomb,
alabama
which
is
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
issued
this
injunction.
the
arrest,
poke
made
the
arrest,
was
based
on
these
activities
and
none
other.
and
in
his
testimony
describing
that
the
–
poke
repeated
again
that
fields
told
the
people
there
that
the
meeting
had
been
called
off.
he
also
testified
that
there
was
no
trouble
and
no
literature
distributed
except
the
thunderbolt.
the
next
witness
was
another
policeman
who
had
arrested
lyons,
his
name
is
mithso.
he
testified
that
he
was
there
at
the
time
before
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
that
lyons
was
passing
out
copies
of
the
thunderbolt.
someone
called
an
officer.
he
went
across
the
street
and
arrested
lyons.
the
officer
hadn't
read
the
thunderbolt
at
that
time,
thunderbolt's
in
the
record,
thunderbolt
does
not
refer
to
the
meeting
at
all
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
distributed.
mithso
testified
that
there
was
no
meeting.
the
next
witness
was,
clyde
morris,
a
member
of
the
bazemore
police
who
were
called
into
assist.
he
served
the
injunction
on
fields
and
informed
fields
that
he
could
not
have
the
meeting.
he
was
present
at
the
scene
where
the
meeting
was
supposed
to
take
place,
but
the
only
testimony
he
had
about
that
was
that
there
was
a
crowd
there
which
included
15
--
12
to
15
officers
of
the
bazemore
police
force.
fields
later
testified,
at
page
49
of
the
record,
that
there
were
40
to
50
police
officers
there.
the
final
witness
was
charles
wood.
mr.
burke
marshall
he
did
not
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
said
a
good
crowd
but
he
did
not
estimate
it.
i
think
fields
testified
that
he
passed
out
about
12
copies
of
the
thunderbolt
and
as
i
said
that
there
were
40
policemen
there,
sizeable
crowd
in
itself.
woods
was
a
member
of
the
fairfield
police,
testified
that
he
saw
the
arrest,
nothing
more
about
the
activities
of
fields
that
he'd
searched
the
car
nearby
and
found
these
shells
and
about
100
copies
of
the
thunderbolt
in
the
car.
he
did
not
see
fields
do
anything
and
mithso
and
woods
were
recalled
to
identify
this
--
the
car
that
was
searched
as
one
in
which
fields
had
been
seen.
that
was
the
total
of
the
prosecution
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
meeting
was
held.
there
was
no
evidence
the
handbills
were
distributed.
there
was
no
evidence
that
fields
said
anything
to
anyone
except
that
the
meeting
had
been
moved
to
lipscomb.
there
was
no
evidence
that
lyons
did
anything
at
all
except
pass
out
copies
of
the
thunderbolt.
the
defense
called
four
witnesses.
smithson
who
is
mayor
of
fairfield,
fields,
mrs.
fields
and
a
man
named
“short”,
who
testified
that
he
had
gone
to
the
--
to
a
meeting
at
lipscomb
that
night
after
having
been
informed
that
the
meeting
place
had
been
changed,
that's
at
page
60
of
the
record.
in
summation,
this
evidence,
defense
evidence,
the
prosecution
evidence
didn't
prove
any
elements
of
the
contempt
that
was
charged.
the
defense
evidence
did
not
advance
the
cause
of
the
prosecution.
the
mayor
testified
nothing
about
what
happened
at
the
place
of
the
meeting
except
that
he
did
not
know
whether
or
not
handbills
were
distributed.
fields
testified
that
there
was
no
meeting,
that
he
went
to
the
place
of
the
meeting
only
to
change
the
location.
he
was
not
permitted
in.
they
were
surrounded
by
police
officers
but
he
did
not
intend
to
violate
the
order
and
that
no
handbills
had
been
distributed
after
the
order
was
issued.
mrs.
fields
confirmed
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
i've
given
you
all
the
evidence
on
that,
mr.
justice,
but
there
was
a
crowd
there.
mr.
burke
marshall
he
went
there.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
testimony
is
that
the
only
things
they
did
there
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
no.
i
would
not
accept
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
mr.
justice,
the
evidence
is
on
both
sides,
both
the
prosecution
and
defense
evidence
is
that
he
went
there
to
tell
the
people
that
came
to
go
the
meeting
that
the
meeting
had
been
called
off
and
changed.
mr.
burke
marshall
(voice
overlap)
if
it
is
a
meeting,
mr.
justice,
i
would
say
that's
not
the
meeting
that
was
prohibited
by
the
injunction.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
white,
the
meeting
that
was
enjoined
is
the
meeting
that
was
called
by
handbill.
the
handbill
appears
at
page
3
and
4
of
the
record.
a
meeting
that
is
held
solely
to
call
off
that
meeting
i
say
is
not
covered
by
the
injunction
whether
you
call
it
a
meeting
or
not.
the
trial
court
did
not
find
any
evidence
of
the
distribution
of
handbills
at
all.
in
fact,
it
said
that
there
was
no
evidence,
page
72
of
the
record,
“while
there
is
no
evidence
that
pamphlet
was
redistributed,
the
writ
of
injunction
says
distribute
further
handbills
announcing
such
meetings
as
were
distributed.”
then
he
referred
to
the
copy
of
the
thunderbolt
which
is
in
the
record
and
which
does
not
refer
to
the
meeting
at
all
said
that
he
was
impressed
by
the
tone
and
the
context
of
the
paper
that
was
admittedly
distributed
and
i
simply
think
that
was
an
artifice
on
the
part
of
someone
to
bring
home
a
fact
that
the
meeting
was
going
to
be
held.
now,
the
trial
court
found
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
only
evidence
was
that
fields,
when
he
distributed
these
copies
of
the
thunderbolt
which
did
not
refer
to
a
meeting,
the
only
evidence
was
that
when
he
did
that,
he
told
the
people
he
distributed
to
them
that
the
meeting
had
been
called
off,
it's
going
to
be
held
in
lipscomb,
alabama
where
he
had
permission
from
the
mayor
to
hold
the
meeting
in
public
park.
and
as
i
say
that
he
--
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
defense
testified
that
he
went
over
there
to
go
to
the
meeting
that
was
held.
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
according
to
--
well,
fields
was
in
jail
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
harlan,
so
he
could
not
have
gone
there.
the
witness,
short,
who
is
at
page
60
of
the
record,
testified
that
he'd
been
told
that
the
meeting
have
been
changed
to
lipscomb
and
that
he
went
to
a
meeting
there.
that's
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
of
that.
lipscomb
was
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
though.
this
court
would
limit
its
injunction
to
the
city
of
fairfield
and
of
course,
the
injunction
was
sought
by
the
city
of
fairfield,
it
didn't
purport
to
limit
what
fields
could
do
anywhere
else.
mr.
burke
marshall
that
--
that's
the
evidence,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
evidence
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
that
that
meeting
--
mr.
burke
marshall
the
--
i
think
i
misstated
that,
mr.
justice
black.
the
injunction
was
limited
to
the
city
of
fairfield.
the
injunction
was
sought
by
the
city
of
fairfield.
the
court
that
issued
the
injunction
was
a
court
of
jefferson
county
so
i
suppose
its
jurisdiction
extends
throughout
the
county.
i'm
not
sure
whether
lipscomb's
in
jefferson
county
or
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
burke
marshall
he
was
arrested
--
mr.
burke
marshall
he
was
arrested
at
the
locality
where
the
meeting
was
to
be
held.
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
inside
a
building
above
a
car
wash.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
handbill
said
that
fields
went
out
there
about
half
an
hour
--
before
he
handed
the
evidence
that
i've
just
discussed
with
you.
mr.
burke
marshall
he
was
arrested
there.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
whether
they
asked
for
bond
or
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
isn't
in
the
record.
he
was
arrested
by
the
officer
chester
poke
whose
testimony
appears
in
the
record
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
was
arrested.
mr.
burke
marshall
not
that
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
involved
here
if
there
was.
mr.
burke
marshall
they
didn't
have
a
meeting,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
he
was
arrested
--
he
was
arrested
before
the
time
the
meeting
was
to
be
held.
he
was
arrested
and
removed
from
the
scene.
i
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
show
what
happened
after
that
at
that
place.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
--
i
think
--
mr.
burke
marshall
he
was
taken
from
the
scene
under
arrest.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
not
review
the
evidence
as
such.
it
did
indicate
in
its
opinion
that
it
thought
that
there
was
evidence
--
that
there
--
that
there
is
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
they
did
violate
the
terms
of
the
temporary
injunction,
but
they
did
not
discuss
what
evidence
that
was
and
they
said
--
in
saying
that
the
court
does
not
review
questions
of
fact
but
only
questions
of
law.
i
take
it
by
that
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
fact,
applied
the
thompson
rule
itself
and
came
to
conclusion
contrary
to
the
one
that
i
urge
on
this
court.
the
rest
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
fields
had
a
right
to
test
the
validity
of
the
order
by
disobeying
it
under
the
united
mine
workers
case.
the
short
of
the
matter,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
i
think
this
record
conclusively
shows
that
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
that
either
fields
or
lyons
did
what
they
were
enjoined
from
doing
and
that
on
the
contrary,
the
evidence
is
all
the
other
way
that
they
obeyed
the
injunction.
they
did
not
--
mr.
burke
marshall
excuse
me,
mr.
--
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
they
both
passed
out
copies
of
the
thunderbolt.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
there
was
not,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
thunderbolt
is
in
the
record.
it
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
meeting
at
all.
it
has
--
doesn't
mention
it,
doesn't
refer
to
it.
it
was
the
--
mr.
wulf
said
that's
the
party
publication,
it's
distributed
to
whoever
wants
to
get
it.
extremely
inflammatory
and
offensive
newspaper
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
having
a
meeting.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption
from
the
handbill.
the
handbill
is
also
a
very
offensive
document
and
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
burke
marshall
the
handbill
that
announced
the
meeting,
the
injunction
again
--
was
against
holding
the
meeting
as
announced,
enjoining
and
restraining
it
in
them
from
holding
the
said
meeting
at
said
time
and
place
and
from
distributing
said
handbills
in
the
city
of
fairfield,
alabama.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
over
the
question
whether
or
not
this
group
of
people
outside
the
building
was
a
meeting
or
not.
but
if
it
was
a
meeting,
it
wasn't
the
meeting
that
was
enjoined
by
this
injunction
because
if
--
if
it
was
a
meeting
at
all,
it
was
a
meeting
to
call
off
the
meeting
that
was
enjoined.
all
of
the
testimony
is
that
way.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
he
did
do
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
i
--
i
would
suppose
--
i
would
suppose
whatever
the
answer
is
to
the
questions
that
mr.
wulf
discussed
and
whatever
the
effect
of
the
mine
workers
case
on
this
and
whatever
the
effect
of
the
first
amendment
on
it,
that
you
have
to
take
an
injunction
of
this
sort
which
does
restrain
a
meeting
that
has
and
then
does
restraint
speech
and
you
have
to
interpret
it
within
its
term
as
narrowly
as
you
can.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
the
--
the
testimony
the
policemen,
one
said
7:30
and
one
said
quarter
of
8,
the
meeting
was
scheduled
for
8.
so
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
it
was
preliminary,
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
particularly
since
the
evidence
not
only
shows
that
there
was
no
meeting
held
but
that
he
told
people
he
rescheduled
it
for
another
place
whether
it
wasn't
enjoined.
it
wasn't
just
that
he
met
there
and
--
and
sort
had
made
a
speech
and
passed
out
the
handbills
outside
the
building
instead
of
inside.
the
evidence
is
all
that
he
told
everyone
that
came
there
that
the
meeting
had
been
called
off
and
rescheduled
for
a
place
that
was
not
covered
by
the
injunction.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
fields
testified
there
were
about
40
policemen,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
at
record
49.
the
bazemore
police
officer
who
was
there,
who
was
named
morris,
testified
that
there
were
12
or
15
officers
from
bazemore,
that's
at
record
page
28.
now
bazemore
is
in
adjoining
community,
so
that
they
were
there
just
to
supplement
fairfield
police
and
so
i
assume
there,
at
least
a
good
many
fairfield
police
there
in
addition
to
the
bazemore
police
who
where
there
on
roam.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
record
does
not
show
that,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
--
the
most
--
most
--
the
--
the
testimony
that
would
most
support
the
view
that
the
meeting
was
held
was
that
there
was
a
good
crowd
and
that
was
what
--
that's
how
morris
described
it,
a
fairly
good
crowd,
record
page
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
clark,
that's
all
the
evidence
of
what
he
did
there.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
that
is
--
is
what
the
record
shows
and
our
contention
is
that
on
the
basis
of
that
record,
consistently
with
the
thompson
and
garner
cases,
he
cannot
constitutionally
be
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
of
court.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
so
i
--
i
do
not
reach
the
other
issues.
