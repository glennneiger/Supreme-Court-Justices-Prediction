but
of
course
others

could
be
named.

what
i
say,
i
was
looking
at
page
four
of
your
brief.
the
hearing
officer
made
a
conclusion
that
mrs.
flynn
was
“an
active
participating
and
continuous
member”,
but
the
board,
which
affirmed
his
conclusion,
its
finding
was
at
all
material
times
mrs.
flynn
was
a
member
of.
is
there
any
significance
in
this?
unknown
speaker
well,

participating
and
continuing?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
the
mr.

ask
you

have
heard
the
evidence?
are
you
relying
on
the
findings
of
the
court
to
review
that
reviewed
it?
unknown
speaker
what
findings
of
fact
are
you
relying
upon?
unknown
speaker
only?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
that
they
were
meaningful
members,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
hearing
officer?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
application
then
disclosed
her
membership.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
