mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
as
justice
goldberg
has
just
said,
the
court
is
again
called
upon
in
these
cases
before
us
today
to
deal
with
another
of
the
difficult
almost
agonizing
problems
that
have
emerged
from
the
efforts
of
congress
in
this
statute
and
others
to
deal
with
what
all
must
recognize
was
a
reasonably
judged
threat
to
our
national
security.
what
was
that
threat?
the
existence
as
congress
found
of
an
international
communist
movement
dominated
by
a
foreign
power,
dedicated
to
the
purpose
and
object
of
imposing
in
this
country
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship.
operating
through
organizations
of
disciplined
members
acting
to
further
those
purposes
in
countries
outsides
of
the
center
and
found
of
the
world
movement.
those
findings
of
which
this
court,
as
justice
douglas
said
in
the
communist
party
case,
have
often
--
has
often
taken
judicial
notice,
are
also
before
the
court
now
as
findings
of
a
legislature,
of
a
coordinate
branch
of
the
government
acting
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
duty,
and
those
findings
also
have
been
held
by
this
court
in
the
communist
party
case
to
be
findings
which
congress
could
make
on
the
record
before
it.
that
is
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with.
mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
justice
black
it
is
clear
that
the
situation
with
respect
to
which
congress
acts
is
always
one
of
the
elements
in
determining
whether
its
action
is
reasonable
or
is
within
constitutional
limits.
as
justice
goldberg
said
a
moment
ago,
this
court
sustained
the
confinement
of
persons
based
only
on
their
race
in
relocation
camps
during
the
war,
because
the
circumstances
then
prevailing
and
as
then
appeared
to
the
congress
were
of
such
magnitude
as
to
justify
it.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
sir
i'm
saying
only
that
as
this
court
has
often
said,
emergency
does
not
create
power,
but
it
may
create
the
occasion
for
its
exercise.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
said,
we
are
not
now
at
war.
but
we
are
in
a
cold
war,
that
cold
war
has
certain
characteristics
and
certainly
those
characteristics
create
the
occasion
for
congress
to
seek
to
deal
with
them,
and
this
court
has
so
held
time
and
time
again.
now
appellants
here
are
members
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
indeed
mrs.
flynn
is
the
chairman
of
that
party
and
mr.
aptheker
is
editor
of
its
theoretical
journal.
this
was
established
on
the
record
in
a
full
administrative
hearing
in
the
department
of
state,
and
indeed
i
take
it
this
much
is
admitted
by
appellants
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
the
communist
party
is
one
of
those
organizations
which
congress
said
existed,
dominated
by
a
foreign
power,
the
soviet
union,
dedicated
to
imposing
a
communist
dictatorship
in
this
country,
prepared
to
use
any
necessary
means
to
that
end,
whether
a
force
or
a
fraud.
and
this
too
was
established
in
a
full
administrative
hearing
after
which
the
party
was
ordered
to
register.
that
is
the
character
of
this
particular
organization
was
established
in
a
proceeding
at
which
it
had
full
opportunity
to
present
evidence
and
to
make
argument
that
it
was
not
this
kind
of
organization
which
was
dedicated
to
these
purposes
and
furthering
these
ends.
and
it
was
found
by
the
board
that
it
was
such
an
organization.
and
on
review
in
this
court,
the
registration
order
of
the
board
was
sustained
by
a
vote
of
5:4.
but
the
findings
of
fact
about
the
character
of
this
organization
were
accepted
by
seven
of
the
justices
on
this
court.
none,
i
might
say,
more
succinctly
or
emphatically
than
by
mr.
justice
douglas
who
dissented
from
the
registration
order
on
another
ground.
he
said,
the
board
found
that
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
is
a
disciplined
organization,
operating
in
this
nation
under
soviet
control
to
install
a
soviet
style
dictatorship
in
the
united
states.
those
findings
are
based
i
think
on
facts
and
i
would
not
disturb
them.
now
congress
found
also
in
this
statute
and
on
the
record
before
it,
it
could
so
find
that
travel
abroad
by
members
of
the
communist
party
was
an
important
means,
indeed
it
said
a
prerequisite
for
advancing
the
purposes
of
that
party.
the
record
before
it
showed
travel
by
united
states
members
of
the
party
abroad
not
only
to
visit
the
british
museum.
but
for
instruction
and
training
to
transmit
and
receive
orders,
to
report
to
establish
face-to-face
contact
among
leaders
and
members.
and
i
think
it's
almost
self-evident
that
a
world
wide
conspiratorial
organization
of
the
kind
which
congress
found
this
world
communist
movement
to
be,
acting
through
a
variety
of
discrete
and
semi
covert
organizations
throughout
the
world,
as
congress
found
this
movement
to
act,
must
depend
on
travel
and
face
to
face
contact
to
bind
it
together
and
to
transmit
impulses
for
action
to
its
constituent
parts.
and
so
congress,
on
this
record
and
on
these
findings
before
it,
a
legislative
record
as
we
know
that
extended
over
ten
years
of
investigation
and
analysis,
during
which
as
my
friend
for
the
appellants
pointed
out,
events
happened
to
the
korean
war,
the
fall
of
czechoslovakia,
the
berlin
blockade,
all
of
which
were
seen
before
congress
as
a
part
of
the
world
movement
with
which
it
was
trying
to
deal.
but
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
statutory
scheme
designed
to
frustrate
the
purposes
of
this
world
communist
movement,
congress
enacted
that
members
of
american
organizations
controlled
by
that
movement
and
acting
predominantly
to
further
its
interests
should
be
denied
passports,
a
prerequisite
in
most
cases
to
travel
abroad.
now
it's
pursuant
to
that
enactment
that
the
passports
of
these
two
appellants
were
withdrawn
and
the
question
before
the
court
is,
can
this
be
done
within
the
constitution.
now
as
appellants
have
pointed
out,
there
are
two
fundamental
grounds
of
constitutional
attack
here,
one
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
one
under
the
first
amendment,
and
both
them
ought
to
be
dealt
with
separately,
because
different
standards
and
different
tests
are
applicable
under
each.
as
is
often
the
case,
both
parties
here
are
agreed
as
to
the
words
in
which
those
tests
are
expressed
and
the
question
becomes
how
those
test
are
to
be
applied
in
a
particular
case.
for
the
fifth
amendment,
our
starting
point
is
kent
and
dulles.
that
case,
as
the
court
knows,
says
that
travel
is
part
of
the
liberty
of
which
the
citizen
cannot
be
deprived
without
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
other
words,
when
speaking
of
travel
generally,
generically
one
might
say,
the
court
was
careful
to
say
that
the
protection
was
the
protection
afforded
by
the
fifth
amendment,
and
as
the
appellants
have
said,
the
test
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
essentially
what
is
fair,
what
is
reasonable.
is
this
measure
a
rational
means
to
an
end
that
congress
could
entertain
under
the
constitution
or
is
it
arbitrary?
does
it
bear
so
little
rational
relation
to
a
proper
congressional
purpose
that
we
must
put
it
down
to
whim
or
passion
or
prejudice
rather
than
the
action
of
reasonable
men
in
pursuit
of
the
great
ends
of
government?
the
second
question
is
under
the
first
amendment,
and
there,
as
my
friend
pointed
out,
it
is
clear
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
the
douds
case
that
the
operation
of
this
statute
acts
to
inhibit
the
exercise
of
certain
rights
of
speech
and
association
by
certain
people.
that
is
what
makes
a
first
amendment
question.
there
were
no
inhibition
on
those
rights
of
associations
and
they
are
particularly
in
this
case
association
rather
than
belief
or
speech
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out
when
he
--
or
i
guess
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
when
he
talked
about
the
power
to
resign
and
continue
to
speak
and
believe
everything
else
that
you
may
speak
or
believe.
in
this
case,
as
i
say
as
in
douds,
the
government
concedes
that
there
is
inhibition
in
the
statute
on
the
rights
of
association
and
that
is
the
beginning
of
analysis
of
the
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
both
--
at
both
the
categories
that
the
appellants
have
advanced
somewhat
differently.
it
is
clear
that
as
to
american
citizens
joining
the
communist
party,
this
exercise
is
the
same
kind
of
inhibition
as
the
douds
requirement
did
or
as
to
person
within
the
united
states
joining
the
communist
party,
it
exercise
the
same
kind
of
inhibition
as
to
aliens
within
the
united
states
as
the
deportation
cases
do.
in
other
words,
it
makes
a
disability,
some
disability,
not
a
prohibition
of
speech
but
a
disability,
depend
upon
an
association
and
therefore
inhibits
to
that
extent
the
association.
now
as
to
the
other
part
of
the
argument,
it
is
true
of
course
that
if
dr.
aptheker
or
mrs.
flynn
can't
go
abroad,
they
can't
go
to
the
british
museum.
but
if
we
take
the
view
that
that
by
itself
raises
a
first
amendment
problem
and
an
insoluble
first
amendment
problem,
because
it's
a
direct
prohibition
of
speech,
then
the
whole
analysis
in
kent
and
dulles
is
gone.
then
the
restraint
on
travel
or
the
restriction
of
travel
is
not
a
deprival
of
fifth
amendment
liberty
but
of
first
amendment
rights,
and
if
that's
so
we
ought
--
the
court
ought
never
to
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
in
dulles
that
the
amendment
which
protects
travel,
qua
travel
is
the
fifth
amendment.
here
we
are
dealing,
and
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
if
the
appellants'
arguments
is
correct,
we
could
not
prohibit
a
person
from
going
abroad
if
we
knew
he
was
going
to
commit
espionage
because
he
might
also
be
going
to
visit
the
british
museum.
mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
recessed
a
half
a
hour
ago
we
had
just
reached
the
point
of
identifying
in
the
large
the
two
constitutional
attacks
on
the
statute,
two
bases
for
constitutional
attack.
and
i
would
now
like
to
turn
in
the
first
instance
to
the
fifth
amendment
attack.
and
as
we
said,
the
question
here
is,
is
this
fair,
is
it
reasonable,
is
it
a
rational
means
to
an
end
that
congress
is
free
to
pursue
under
the
constitution.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
fairly
readily
disposed
of
the
end
that
congress
is
pursing
is
the
preservation
of
the
national
security
by
frustrating
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
a
world
movement
which
is
dedicated
to
overthrowing
our
government.
and
as
this
court
quoting
madison
in
the
41st
federal
has
said,
protection
against
foreign
danger
is
one
of
the
primitive
objects
of
civil
society.
it
is
an
avowed
an
essential
object
of
the
american
union,
the
power
requisite
for
obtaining
it
must
be
effectually
confided
to
the
federal
counsels.
so
we
have
an
appropriate
end,
an
end
that
congress
can
constitutionally
entertain.
and
we
have
a
finding
that
congress
has
made
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
travel
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
apparatus,
the
integument
of
this
world
organization
whose
purposes
it
is
seeking
to
frustrate.
so
that
it
is
then
not
irrational
to
seek
to
prevent
that
travel
as
a
way
of
seeking
to
prevent
the
attainment
of
those
unlawful
objectives.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
think
we
agreed
that
the
basic
source
of
congressional
power
is
the
power
to
protect
and
defend
the
national
security
against
foreign
danger,
foreign
danger
acting
internally
through
dominated
and
controlled
organizations.
and
a
foreign,
a
foreign
movement
which
requires,
because
it's
working
at
a
distance,
because
it's
working
through
semi-covert
internal
organizations,
requires
travel
to
establish
contact
and
strength
and
tie
the
bonds
with
those
internal
organizations.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
sir,
it's
not
war
time
and
therefore
it's
not
the
war
power.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
sir,
i
think
it's
power
to
take,
take
action
to
protect
and
defend
the
security
of
the
united
states.
mr.
abram
chayes
now
that's
part
of
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
relations
because
the
object,
one
of
the
main
objects
of
our
foreign
policy
is
it
must
be
of
our
domestic
policy
is
to
protect
the
security
of
the
united
states.
mr.
abram
chayes
it's
not
the
commerce
power,
no
sir.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
find
it
in
the
sovereign,
the
inherent
power
of
every
sovereign
to
protect
its
own
existence
against
foreign
danger.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes
it
did
in
the
edwards
case
although
as
you
know
mr.
justice
douglas
the
crandall
and
nevada
suggested
and
other
comments
have
suggested
--
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
consider
that
it
is
also
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
think
that's
imprisonment
and
this
isn't
imprisonment.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes
it
still
is,
i
think
when
you
get
to
confining
people
in
a
narrow
room
that
comes
to
be
imprisonment
and
that
is
the
kind
of
punishment
that
has
to
be
taken
on
the
basis
of
a
judicial
trail.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
think
there
have
been
certain
circumstances
as
the
court
knows
in
which
the
court
has
sustained
that
power
as
to
american
citizens.
now
they
are
--
mr.
abram
chayes
they
are,
they
are
circumstances
of
acute
danger,
yes.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
and
all
that
we
say
here
is
that
the
danger
may
not
be
so
grave
as
to
justify
that
kind
of
confinement,
but
it
is
plain
enough
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well
the
question
is
in
each
case,
what
is
the
danger
perceived,
how
reasonable
are
the
relations
as
the
means
to
the
end.
mr.
abram
chayes
they
can't
get
a
passport
but
the
secretary
of
state
has
discretionary
authority
under
section
215
to
waive
the
requirement
of
passport
for
exit.
now
my
friend
said
that
that
won't
waive
the
requirement
of
the
foreign
government
for
a
passport
as
a
means
of
entry,
but
in
fact
we
will
also
give
a
document
of
identification
which
is
in
most
cases
enough
to
get
him
into
a
country
that
has
a
passport
entry
requirement.
so
that
there
does
exist
under
the
statute
as
it
now
stands
i
believe
adequate
power
for
the
secretary
of
state
to
make
an
exception
in
meritorious
circumstances.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
we
haven't
had
any
applications
for
an
exception
since
this
statute
has
been
in
effect.
but
it
is
true
that
the
before
kent
and
briehl,
before
those
cases
in
which
the
court
struck
down
our
administration
practice,
when
we
were
denying
passports
to
communists
on
the
basis
of
our
internal
regulations,
we
did
make
an
exception
in
one
case
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
secretary's
power
to
make
exceptions
under
section
2
(15).
mr.
abram
chayes
no
person
who
has
been
shown
on
an
open
record
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
has
a
right
to
a
passport
unless
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well
the
only
parties
that
can
be
named
are
parties
that
are
also
found
on
an
open
record
and
at
the
end
of
a
judicial
type
hearing
to
have
these
characteristics
namely
foreign
control,
dedicated
to
the
purpose
of
imposing
a
dictatorship
here,
and
committed
to
doing
it
by
whatever
means
it's
necessary.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
we
are
saying
that's
what
the
statute
requires
in
this
case.
mr.
abram
chayes
our
--
the
argument
that
we
are
making
sir
is
that
when
a
statute
is
so
limited,
it
falls
within
an
appropriate
power
to
protect
against
threats
to
the
national
security,
and
that
congress
--
the
question
here
is
not
what
the
limits
are
of
congressional
action
but
whether
this
statute
is
constitutional.
and
we
say
that
this
statute
is
so
limited
to
parties
of
this
kind.
remember,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
communist
party
is
not
designated
here
by
affiant
either
legislative
or
administrative.
mr.
abram
chayes
nobody
picked
the
communist
party
out
and
said
it
was
a
bad
party
and
therefore
people
can't
travel.
it
was
found
to
be
a
party
having
certain
characteristics
after
a
full
administrative
hearing
complying
with
all
the
safeguards
of
procedural
due
process
in
which
it
was
free
however
it
chose
to
meet
the
charge
that
it
had
these
characteristics
and
it
was
found
to
have
had
them
and
this
court
sustained
those
findings.
mr.
abram
chayes
this
court
sustained
the
findings.
mr.
abram
chayes
it
was
a
full
hearing
and
requirement
of
substantial
--
of
preponderance
of
evidence
in
the
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
we
are
now
talking
i
think
for
the
moment
about
the
question
whether
this
is
a
rational
means
to
this
end.
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
having
established
these
preconditions
namely
that
the
organization
is
found
to
have
these
characteristics
in
an
administrative
hearing,
that
the
parties
--
the
persons
are
found
to
be
members
of
the
party
in
a
full
due
process
hearing,
that
the
organization
is
found
by
congress
to
depend
on
travel,
it's
not
irrational
then
to
seek
to
inhibit
travel
in
order
to
frustrate
the
objectives
that
the
movement
is
seeking
to
accomplish.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say
--
oh
absolute
prohibition
on
travel.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
the
main
burden
of
the
attack
on
the
statute
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it
is
that
to
say
that
all
communists
can't
be
permitted
or
given
passports
is
too
broad,
so
broad
as
to
be
irrational.
but
i
submit
that
at
least
for
the
fifth
amendment
side
of
the
case,
i
think
perhaps
different
considerations
would
and
different
principles
would
operate.
i
think
those
principles
operate
to
sustain,
but
different
principle
operate
on
the
first
amendment
side
of
the
case,
but
for
the
fifth
amendment
side
of
the
case,
i
think
we
are
in
the
same
place
we
were
in
american
communication
association
versus
douds,
where
this
court
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
membership
in
a
political
association
is
made
the
basis
of
classification
does
not
mean
that
the
classification
is
irrational
or
unconstitutional.
and
indeed
the
court
will
remember
that
in
the
douds
case
again
two
of
the
dissenters,
justices
frankfurter
and
jackson,
upheld
the
oath
on
the
membership
side
of
the
oath.
they
were
worried
about
the
belief
side
of
the
oath;
there
is
no
belief
issue
here.
there
is
an
objective
standard,
membership.
now
why
did
douds
say
that?
douds
cited
a
whole
series
of
cases;
it
cited
agnew
versus
board
of
governors
or
the
federal
reserve,
upholding
a
statute,
which
prohibited
all
underwriters
from
serving
as
officers
or
directors
of
national
banks.
it
wasn't
necessary
to
bring
home
to
the
particular
underwriter
that
he
might
be
going
to
commit
a
breach
of
trust
or
have
a
conflict
of
interest
on
the
national
bank.
it
was
enough
that
the
class
was
rationally
related,
the
classification
was
rationally
related
to
the
evil
to
be
forestalled.
mr.
abram
chayes
and
they
want
to
travel,
travel
aboard.
well
i
think
again
if
i
may
address
that
on
the
first
amendment
side
of
the
case,
because
i
think
that's
where
it
was
addressed
in
douds.
i
just
want
to
establish
here
that
the
general
principle,
that
the
classification,
is
not
necessarily
related
to
the
particular
persons
of
whom
undesirable
activity
can
be
expected,
is
always
the
case,
where
the
congress
tries
to
anticipate
the
evil
rather
than
act
after
the
evil
has
occurred,
because
the
consequence
of
trying
to
anticipate
the
evil
is
you
don't
know
whether
any
particular
person
is
going
to
do
the
undesirable
act,
and
so
if
congress
is
to
have
the
power
to
forestall
evil,
as
it
did
in
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
cases,
as
it
did
in
the
board
--
the
agnew
case,
and
as
it
does
over
and
over
and
over
again.
every
factory
is
subject
to
inspection
under
the
food
and
drug
act,
why?
not
because
we
believe
a
particular
manufacturer,
we
don't
have
to
start
with
the
proposition
that
a
particular
manufacturer
is
probably
doing
the
bad
thing.
we
are
trying
to
forestall
he
is
doing
the
bad
thing,
and
that's
why
the
classification
must
be
broader
than
merely
those
whom
we
now
already
are
engaging
in
the
disapproved
conduct.
and
the
consequences
saying
we
can't
draw
the
circle
any
narrower
or
any
broader
than
those
who
are
already
engaging
or
will
engage
that
we
know
will
engage
in
the
conduct
is
to
say
we
can't
act
in
advance
at
all.
and
so
the
only
question
is,
is
this
a
rational
class,
is
it
rational
to
say
that
all
lawyers
should
be
disqualified
from
jury
service,
for
example,
because
some,
maybe
may
not
follow
the
instruction
of
the
judge,
but
the
instruction
of
their
law
professor.
is
it
rational
to
do
all
the
other
things
that
we
do
on
the
basis
of
anticipatory
desire
to
forestall
conduct
that
it
is
appropriate
to
seek
to
forestall?
mr.
abram
chayes
it
had
to,
because
otherwise
unless
it's
somehow
related
to
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
then
it's
arbitrary,
and
that
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
--
mr.
abram
chayes
because
--
well
i
don't
i
don't
think
i
have
to
struggle
with
it
very
hard
either
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that's
the
sum
total
of
the
fifth
amendment
argument.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
the
court
has
held
in
the
--
mr.
abram
chayes
in
the
communist
party
case
that
it
was
not
the
object
of
the
government
to
put
the
party
out
of
business.
i
think
that
was
--
mr.
abram
chayes
expressly
considered
in
the
communist
party
case
and
the
court
held
no,
that
wasn't
the
idea
--
mr.
abram
chayes
that
court
held
that
the
object
of
the
--
this
statutory
scheme
was
not
to
put
the
communist
party
out
of
business,
but
was
to
regulate
the
conditions
under
which
it
could
act.
mr.
abram
chayes
they
are
trying
to
frustrate
the
evil
objectives
which
congress
found.
now
the
fact
that
congress
did
so
having
a
care
to
other
rights
and
principles
that
operate
also
in
the
premises
shouldn't
make
the
act
unconstitutional,
quite
the
reverse,
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
abram
chayes
the
court
--
it
doesn't
have
to
pass
on
anything
in
this
case,
but
the
question
whether
the
withdrawal
of
a
passport
from
these
two
appellants
under
these
circumstances
was
beyond
the
congressional
power.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
it
does
for
the
fifth
amendment
part
of
the
argument,
yes
sir,
and
that's
why
i
say
i
don't
think
the
fifth
amendment
part
of
the
argument
is
very
different.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
you
have
to
judge
what
congress
does
and
you
have
to
judge
it
as
you
well
--
all
well
understand
with
under
the
fifth
amendment
with
deference
to
the
fact
that
congress
has
made
this
choice
and
that
congress
has
made
this
choice.
so
to
say
that
it's
an
irrational
choice,
it's
the
exercise
of
a
very,
very
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
abram
chayes
i
say
the
court
has
done
it,
and
has
done
it
over
and
over
again.
mr.
abram
chayes
and
i
say
that
i
don't
know
any
other
test
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
i
think
the
real
problem
of
this
case
and
the
real
issues
of
difficulty
and
there
are
issues
of
difficulty
arise
not
under
the
fifth
amendment
because
as
mr.
justice
black
has
said
it's
not
hard
to
find
rationality
in
this
pattern
given
the
premises
that
congress
acted
on
and
that
this
court
has
said
they
could
act
on.
so
the
real
problem
--
mr.
abram
chayes
what?
mr.
abram
chayes
fine.
i
am
pleased
to
accept
your
--
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
i'm
pleased
to
accept
the
concession
mr.
justice
black.
[laughing]
mr.
abram
chayes
the
real
issues
here
are
under
the
first
amendment.
and
as
our
--
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
say,
the
question
here
is,
is
the
statute
narrowly
drawn
so
as
to
keep
to
a
minimum
the
impingement
and
the
peripheral
impingement
on
first
amendment
rights,
which
we've
already
defined
and
discussed.
and
i
say
this
statute
is
narrowly
drawn.
nobody
here
is
prevented
from
travel
on
suspicion
or
on
some
--
on
the
basis
of
some
secret
dossier.
in
fact,
quite
the
reverse,
both
on
the
procedural
side
and
on
the
substantive
side
the
statute
is
drawn
as
narrowly
as
possible
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i'm
somewhat,
i
would
say,
surprised
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
hear
it
said
that
a
statute
which
permits
the
secretary
of
state
to
withhold
a
passport
if
he
finds
that
the
travel
maybe
inimical
to
the
national
security
or
national
interest
of
united
states
is
narrower
somehow
than
this
statute.
look
at
that
standard,
the
standard
that
it
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
would
only
say
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
in
the
briehl
case
itself,
the
court
said
as
to
our
then
existing
regulation,
which
you
recall
permitted
the
withdrawal
of
a
passport
not
because
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
but
because
the
conduct
abroad
would
be
inimical
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
which
took,
only
took
communist
party
membership
into
account
as
appellants
say
would
be
a
proper
situation.
what
the
court
said
about
that
is,
and
it
said,
“the
only
law
which
congress
has
passed
expressly
curtailing
the
movement
of
communists
across
our
borders
has
not
yet
become
effective.”
that
was
this
section
6
that
we're
now
talking
about.
it
would
therefore
be
strange
to
infer
that
pending
the
effectiveness
of
that
law,
the
secretary
has
been
silently
granted
by
congress
the
larger,
the
more
pervasive
power
to
curtail
in
his
discretion
the
free
movement
of
citizens
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
about
their
beliefs.
now
i
think
it's
possible
in
a
sort
of
an
abstract
logical
sense
to
say
that
all
you're
worried
about
is
conduct
abroad
that's
going
to
be
dangerous
to
our
security
and
therefore
in
order
to
prevent
travel,
you
ought
to
have
some
showing
that
the
conduct
is
likely
to
be
dangerous
to
our
security.
and
that
has
a
very
plausible
and
pleasing
sound
to
it,
and
i
don't
deny
that
abstractly
that
sounds
like
a
narrower
regulation.
but
if
you
think
of
the
problem
of
administering
that
kind
of
statute,
if
you
think
of
the
problem
of
appraising
evidence
to
fathom
an
individual's
future
intentions,
if
you
think
of
the
problem
of
what
this
is,
giving
the
person
the
opportunity
to
go
abroad
and
there
to
do
what
he
pleases.
he
may
correctly
have
no
and
properly
say
that
he
has
no
intention
of
doing
anything
wrong,
when
he
appears
before
the
hearing,
but
when
he
gets
over
there,
there
may
then
be
an
opportunity
to
engage
in
the
wrongful
activity
which
he
embraces,
indeed
that's
happened
and
cases
of
that
kind
are
cited,
of
misuse
of
passport
after
accepting
stipulations.
mr.
abram
chayes
surely,
and
all
i
say
is
that
--
to
say
that
that's
narrower
than
the
inhabitation
proposed
here,
is
to
me
a
strange
way
of
dealing
with
it,
because
what
have
we
done
when
we've
had
to
--
when
we've
had
to
administer
standards
of
that
kind.
we
have
relied
on
confidential
evidence,
because
after
all
if
you
have
a
standard
of
that
kind,
the
necessity
or
the
desirability
of
seeming
--
of
relying
on
confidential
evidence
seems
greater.
so
most
of
these
bills
that
are
cited
in
the
appellants'
brief
do
provide
that
in
certain
cases
the
secretary
may
rely
on
secret
or
confidential
evidence.
we
reverse
burdens
of
proof
which
is
in
fact
what
we
did
in
the
passport
regulations
that
existed
in
kent
and
briehl,
in
the
kent
and
briehl
cases.
it
was
necessary
for
the
applicant
to
satisfy
the
secretary
that
he
was
going
abroad
for
a
bad
end
--
an
innocent
end
or
we
throw
the
net
wider.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes
but
also
--
mr.
abram
chayes
but
it
was
also
possible
to
deny
passports
to
people
who
weren't
members
at
all,
who
we
suspected
on
various
grounds
without
any
objective
indicia
of
dedication
to
these
ends.
and
so
when
you
put
all
these
things
together,
which
i
submit
mr.
justice
goldberg
are
the
practicalities
of
administering
this
kind
of
a
standard
and
if
you
look
to
see
which
one
is
going
to
inhibit
protected
activity
more,
which
one
is
going
to
have
a
wider
reach
within
the
population,
which
is
the
imposition
of
a
loyalty
oath
and
a
loyalty
test.
the
standard
which
appellants
suggest
is
the
appropriate
one,
would
in
fact
be
broader
than
the
standard
we
have
here.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
we
do
have
the
statute
and
our
regulations
provide
that
if
a
person
is
going
abroad
for
the
specific
purpose
of
conducting
unlawful
activities
abroad,
he
can
be
denied
a
passport,
and
we
have
done
that
upon
occasion.
so
that
an
espionage
person,
the
person
who
is
actually
going
abroad
and
we
know
that
he
is
going
abroad
to
do
something
unlawful
is
covered,
and
i
think
the
court
in
the
kent
case
said
that
that
was
an
appropriate
regulation
of
the
passport
right.
so
the
difficulty
is
that
it
only
happens
in
the
rarest
of
case
that
we
know
that
a
person
is
going
abroad
for
espionage.
and
my
friends
say
that
the
prevention
of
espionage
is
the
only
object
of
this
statue.
i
think
that's
not
the
case.
i
think
anybody
who
has
engaged
in
a
cooperative
venture,
all
of
us
have
engaged
in
many
for
business,
for
pleasure,
for
government,
knows
that
face-to-face
contact,
knowledge,
understanding
of
the
minds
and
of
the
actions
of
one's
co-participants
is
an
essential
to
the
success
of
that
kind
of
venture.
this
isn't
speech
in
the
accepted
sense,
this
isn't
associated
in
the
accepted
sense.
this
is
a
team
getting
together
to
work
for
its
object
as
a
team.
now
when
its
objects
are
unlawful
or
when
its
objects
are
those
of
the
kind
that
this
world
organization
has,
it
seems
to
me
necessarily
that
to
follow,
that
this
kind
of
personal
contact
face-to-face
intercourse
is
essential
to
the
carrying
out
of
those
objects
and
therefore
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
would.
it
would
be
a
much
harder
case
than
this.
as
the
court
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no
because
it
is
not
a
number
of
people
who
simply
entertain
beliefs,
it's
a
number
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
the
constitution
says
something
about
belief
as
well,
speech
as
well.
but
--
mr.
abram
chayes
the
point
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no
when
the
government
imposes
disabilities,
which
are
not
criminal
penalties
on
a
person,
he's
not
necessarily
entitled
to
a
jury
trail.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
think
there
are
two
differences,
main
differences
in
a
criminal
penalty.
and
i
don't
disagree
that
by
compounding
civil
disabilities
one
can
reach
the
point
where
one
is
really
prohibiting
the
activity
outright.
but
the
main
difference
--
mr.
abram
chayes
not
from
speaking
or
believing
or
associating.
mr.
abram
chayes
prohibiting
--
it's
regulating
their
travel.
mr.
abram
chayes
but
not
prohibiting
speech.
mr.
abram
chayes
not
in
accordance
with
the
--
not
according
to
this
legislation
which
was
offered
and
which
these
people
--
mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
justice
black
i
don't
believe
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
whether
they
can
have
a
passport.
for
example
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no
he
has
to
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
he
has
to
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no
the
secretary
can
act
only
in
accordance
with
statutory
authority
given
to
him
by
congress,
that's
what
the
kent
case
said.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
every
young
man
--
mr.
abram
chayes
every
young
man
who
served
in
the
army
has
had
his
locomotion
restricted
without
a
jury
trial.
anyone
who
is
put
into
quarantine
because
he
has
got
the
smallpox
--
mr.
abram
chayes
the
relevance
of
that
--
mr.
abram
chayes
the
relevance
of
that
is
--
mr.
abram
chayes
nor
--
mr.
abram
chayes
nor
is
the
congress
here.
the
congress
here
is
establishing
a
general
classification,
all
people
holding,
falling
within
that
classification
are
treated
alike.
no
sir,
all
people
being
members
having
objectively
manifested
their
membership
in
a
certain
kind
or
organization.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
don't
--
i
think
the
question
of
trial
here
is
just
an
apposite.
this
isn't
a
trial
for
their
beliefs.
mr.
abram
chayes
there
are
all
--
mr.
abram
chayes
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
that
i
can
be
given
or
denied
by
government
without
a
jury
trial.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
can
--
mr.
abram
chayes
the
only
--
my
only
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is
that
this
is
not
designed
as
punishment
either
as
punishment
for
conduct
or
to
prohibit
conduct,
and
once
--
mr.
abram
chayes
there
is
no
question
that
it's
a
disability
and
i
don't
want
to
demean
or
deprecate
the
disability.
but
the
court
has
said
that
disabilities
other
than
criminal
punishment
can
be
imposed
on
people
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of
membership.
mr.
abram
chayes
the
court
has
said
for
example
that
aliens
can
be
deported
on
this
same
basis
under
the
same
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
think
the
distinction
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
but
they
said
that
a
non-alien
could
be
deprived
of
his
officership
in
a
labor
union
or
could
be
required
a
--
or
could
be
required
to
swear
that
he
was
not
a
member
of
this
party
in
order
to
hold
a
position
in
a
labor
union,
which
could
then
make
use
of
the
facilities
of
the
labor
board.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it's
clear
that
as
to
matters
which
don't
involve
criminal
punishment,
which
don't
involve
a
direct
prohibition
of
speech,
association,
belief,
disabilities
maybe
imposed
on
the
basis
of
certain
kinds
of
membership
and
membership
as
the
court
said
only
the
other
day
in
the
quinones
case,
membership
in
which
the
element
of
advocacy
of
unlawful
objectives
was
not
brought
home
to
the
person
upon
whom
the
disability
was
imposed.
so
it
seems
to
me
if
the
constitution
resides
or
is
to
be
found
in
the
interpretations
that
this
court
has
given
it,
i
can
answer
your
question
very
easily.
no,
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
every
time
--
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
a
single
administrator
on
an
open
record
and
at
a
full
hearing
yes,
that's
so
--
mr.
abram
chayes
before
he
is
punished
for
crime.
mr.
abram
chayes
but
this
court
in
the
mendoza
case
only
last
year
i
think
spent
five
or
six
pages
of
an
opinion
trying
to
determine
whether
a
disability,
a
disability
in
that
case
of
loss
of
citizenship,
was
designed
as
a
punishment
for
crime
in
which
case
the
court
decided
it
was
designed
as
a
punishment
for
crime
and
then
decided
it
could
not
be
imposed
without
a
jury
trial,
but
in
another
parallel
--
mr.
abram
chayes
in
another
parallel
case,
where
they
decided
that
denaturalization
was
not
a
punishment
for
crime,
but
an
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
power
they
held
that
denaturalization
was
not
a
punishment
and
that
a
citizenship
could
be
taken
away
from
him
without
a
jury
trial
as
to
the
facts.
so
there
you
have
in
two
cases
in
this
court
dealing
with
the
same
kind
of
disability,
denaturalization.
the
court
in
two
separate
opinions
saying
in
one
yes
it
is
a
criminal
penalty
and
therefore
there
must
be
a
jury
trial
and
in
the
other,
no
it
isn't
a
criminal
penalty,
in
this
case
it's
a
different
kind
of
thing
and
therefore
we
need
a
jury
trial.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
my
argument
does
not
lead
me
to
that
point
at
all.
it
says
that
where
denaturalization
is
imposed
as
a
punishment,
and
this
court
will
determine
in
each
particular
statutory
provision
whether
it
is
imposed
as
a
punishment
or
not.
where
it's
imposed
as
a
punishment,
it
requires
a
jury
trial;
where
it's
imposed
for
something
else,
it
doesn't
require
a
jury
trial.
and
i
submit
those
--
mr.
abram
chayes
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
mendoza
case
i
think.
mr.
abram
chayes
it
holds
--
it
held
that
because
in
that
case
denaturalization
was
intended
by
congress
as
a
punishment,
punishment
for
desertion
i
think
it
was.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
the
whole
structure
of
the
opinion
indicates
that
if
mr.
justice
goldberg
had
found
that
it
was
not
intended
as
a
punishment,
he
would
not
have
required
a
jury
trial.
mr.
abram
chayes
he
did
not,
no,
but
mr.
justice
brennan
in
a
different
case
did
manage
to
uphold
the
depravation
of
citizenship
on
--
the
perez
case
i
think,
on
a
ground
and
without
a
jury
trial.
i
think
in
--
we
do
have
to
consider,
i
agree
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
accumulation
of
disabilities
mounts
up
to
a
prohibition
of
the
activity
rather
than
merely
a
regulation
of
it.
but
here
i
submit
the
statute
is
drawn
so
as
not
to
prohibit
the
activity,
but
so
as
to
define
the
conditions
under
which
it
maybe
carried
out
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
difference
between
the
scales
case,
for
example,
which
appellants
have
cited
and
relied
on
very
heavily
and
the
cases
we
have
here.
you
cannot
punish
speech,
you
cannot
put
a
man
in
jail
for
it,
you
cannot
prohibit
it
as
a
norm
of
conduct
without
bringing
home
to
that
individual
and
in
a
trial
by
jury
that
he
himself
advocated
the
illegal
objects
of
the
organization.
but
when
it
comes
to
disabilities
less
than
criminal
penalties,
the
court
has
sustained
a
number
and
had
sustained
them
very
recently
to
be
imposed
without
a
jury
trial
and
on
the
basis
of
association,
that
is
membership
without
brining
home
to
the
individual
any
unlawful
advocacy,
any
commitment
to
the
unlawful
objectives
of
the
organization.
so
long
as
it
is
shown
that
his
association
with
the
organization
is
not
merely
nominal
or
passive,
but
is
some
sort
of
a
meaningful
involvement
in
the
association,
in
the
organization's
activities.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
the
point
is
that
this
is
not
designed
as
a
prior
restraint
on
speech,
as
was
the
case
in
near
versus
minnesota
or
the
obscenity
statutes.
it's
not
designed
to
prevent
people
in
advance
from
saying
dangerous
things
or
to
keep
them
from
access
to
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
it's
designed
to
prevent
them
from
doing
other
things,
contributing
in
other
ways
to
the
success
and
to
the
objectives
of
this
world
organization
which
we
have
already
described.
although
unfortunately
at
the
same
time,
they
may
also
be
speaking
or
associating,
and
that's
why
it's
not
a
prior
restraint
case
in
the
sense
of
near
or
the
licensing
cases
and
so
on.
mr.
abram
chayes
no
it's
not.
it's
not
intended
as
a
regulation
of
speech
at
all,
it
has
as
we
all
agree
the
consequences
of
preventing
some
speech
and
inhibiting
some
association.
but
the
question
there
is
not
to
be
judged
in
the
same
way
as
it
was
in
de
jonge
and
oregon,
the
case
on
which
the
appellant
relies
where
the
problem
was
can
you
prohibit
this
speech,
can
you
put
a
man
in
jail
for
this
speech.
mr.
abram
chayes
it
is
necessary
to
tailor
the
statute
in
that
way,
and
we
submit
that
this
statute
is
so
tailored.
i
could
read
just
one
quotation
from
justice
jackson
in
the
douds
case
when
he
talked
about
the
inferences
which
congress
could
draw
from
membership
in
this
organization.
‘inferences
for
membership
in
such
an
organization,'
he
said,
‘are
justifiably
different
from
those
to
be
drawn
from
membership
in
the
usual
type
of
political
party.
individuals
who
assume
such
obligations
are
chargeable
on
ordinary
conspiracy
principles
with
responsibility
for
and
participation
in
all
that
makes
up
the
parties
program.'
and
that
was
in
an
opinion
where
he
said,
you
couldn't
make
a
disability
depend
on
belief,
but
you
could
on
membership
in
this
kind
of
organization.
as
this
court
has
held
over
and
over
again
in
the
deportation
cases,
in
douds,
and
in
other
similar
cases.
i
would
say,
if
it
please
the
court
that
as
the
discussion
has
shown
this
is
not
an
easy
case,
it's
a
case
which
presents
us,
the
congress
in
the
first
instance,
the
administration
in
the
second,
and
now
the
court
sitting
in
review
with
the
agony
of
choice.
we
have
here
great
ends
of
government
on
both
sides
of
the
scale.
great
end
of
free
speech
and
free
association
to
which
we
are
dedicated.
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale
the
great
end
of
protecting
the
security
of
our
government.
congress
was
faced
with
this
choice
in
the
first
instance,
the
choice
was
a
necessary
one.
you
can't
have
one
and
still
have
the
other.
you've
got
to
make
some
choice
if
you
are
going
to
deal
with
this
problem,
and
the
alternative,
the
alternative
is
to
prohibit
congress
to
prevent
it,
to
say
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
deal
with
this
problem.
congress
made
the
choice,
i
submit,
that
in
fifth
amendment
terms,
it
was
a
rational
choice.
i
submit
that
in
first
amendment
terms,
it
was
a
choice,
which
in
practical
consequence
was
the
narrow
choice
rather
than
the
broad
choice,
that
a
statute
directed
to
suspicion
of
evil
conduct
aboard,
a
statute
permitting
as
would
seem
to
be
necessary
under
any
other
standard
resort
to
secret
information,
is
a
broader
statute
not
a
narrower
statute.
however,
it
may
seem
superficially
that
here
congress
insisted
upon
full
procedural
due
process
in
which
every
person
subject
to
the
disabilities
of
this
statute
have
the
right
to
meet
the
evidence
against
him,
to
appear
by
attorney,
and
to
make
argument
and
to
have
a
decision
on
the
record.
i
submit
that
it
chose
an
objective
criteria
as
this
court
has
said
in
killian
and
in
the
deportation
cases,
an
objective
criteria,
a
criteria
manifested
by
objective
acts.
what
mr.
justice
brennan
called
membership
in
the
douds
sense
in
his
dissent
in
the
killian
case.
that's
the
kind
of
criterion
that
has
been
chosen
here.
it's
an
objective
criterion
and
it
has
the
effect
of
narrowing
the
statute
rather
than
submitting
the
applicant
to
the
whim
or
the
suspicion
of
an
administrator.
for
these
reasons
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well
i
think
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
note
that
the
court
need
only
decide
the
case
for
these
two
appellants
and
as
to
these
two
appellants,
as
we
have
already
said,
they
are
the
president
of
the
party
and
the
editor
of
its
chief
theoretical
journal.
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
which
by
any
standard
of
meaningfulness
makes
their
association
with
the
party
meaningful,
so
that
we
do
believe
the
court
can
decide
on
these
two
appellants
and
leave
for
another
day
someone
whose
contact
with
the
party
is
less
intimate.
on
the
other
hand
we
do
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no
we
believe
that
you
have
to
be
a
member
in
the
sense
which
member
has
been
decided
in
cases
in
this
court
construing
the
same
term
in
other
sections
of
the
same
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
but
we
say
that
the
court
need
not,
all
i
am
answering
is
mr.
justice
white's
question.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
mr.
justice
black
we've
defended,
and
my
argument
has
been
premised
on
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
the
reason
or
the
difference
is
that
anyone
can
remove
himself
by
that
--
from
the
pains
of
the
statute
by
simply
resigning
from
the
party
as
i
guess
mr.
justice
harlan
stated,
and
the
essential
character
of
a
bill
of
attainder
is
that
it's
existing
punishment,
it's
present
punishment
for
past
conduct
without
a
jury
trial.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
here
we
say,
there
was
no
legislative
determination
on
these
people
or
on
this
party.
these
people
and
this
party
had
a
judicial
type
hearing
before
administrative,
before
administrative
agencies
subject
to
review
in
court.
and
--
mr.
abram
chayes
we
have
finding
of
congress
which
described
the
problem
they
were
dealing
with,
but
which
did
not
proscribe
this
party.
mr.
abram
chayes
the
complete
answer
to
the
bill
of
attainder
argument,
i
submit,
is
that
anyone
can
remove
himself
from
the
penalties
of
this
statute
by
simply
resigning
from
the
party
and
although
that
maybe
a
difficult
choice.
mr.
abram
chayes
it's
inconsistent
with
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
that
whether
that
was
an
attainder
or
not
or
whether
it
was
some
other
kind
of
regulation,
i
think
it
was
probably
not
an
attainder.
mr.
abram
chayes
we've
had
no
cases
before
us
except
these
two.
mr.
abram
chayes
so
that
there
is
no
practice.
i
would
point
out
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
these
appellants
now
say
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
to
prohibit
any
member
from
getting
a
party
--
passport
even
though
his
connection
--
however
tenuous
his
connection
with
the
party
maybe,
but
they
did
not
raise
that
issue.
and
the
usual
way
to
test
that
kind
of
an
issue
is
to
raise
it
so
that
it
can
be
tested
on
a
record.
the
department's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
although
it's
not
one
that
has
been
tested
in
actual
adjudication,
would
be
that
a
member
of
the
party
means
what
this
court
has
said
member
means
in
other
cases
under
this
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
well
it's
talked
--
it's
used
a
different
phraseology
in
different
cases.
it
said
--
i
think
the
best
thing
or
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
that
it's
talked
about
meaningful
association,
and
it
means
some
involvement
in
the
policies
and
programs.
mr.
abram
chayes
innocent,
passive,
nominal;
innocent
is
negated
by
the
statute
itself
in
terms,
because
it
requires
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
required
to
register.
so
you
have
at
least
to
know
you
belong
this
organization.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
under
constraint
or
duress,
surely.
i
think
this
court
knows
the
cases
rowoldt,
galvan,
the
other
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
don't
see
how
we
content
the
member
means
one
thing
in
one
section
and
another
thing
in
another
section.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
i
don't
think
it
goes
as
far
as
active
membership
in
the
scales
case
because
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
don't
think
there
is
any
significance
in
the
difference
in
phraseology.
i
think
when
the
board
and
the
secretary
use
the
term
member
in
a
conclusory
finding,
they
meant
member
as
defined
in
the
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
i
think
that
finding
stands
undisputed
even
though
it
wasn't
repeated.
i
mean
the
facts
show
that,
the
fact
show
continuing
membership
since
1937.
they
show
her
in
a
variety
of
officer
positions
in
the
party,
they
show
a
great
many
activities.
indeed
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
at
one
time
conviction.
mr.
abram
chayes
the
other
party
also
longstanding
membership
in
the
party,
dr.
aptheker
the
editor
of
its
theoretical
--
of
its
principle
theoretical
journal,
indeed
the
record
shows
travel
by
dr.
aptheker
to
japan
in
the
past
to
meet
with
japanese
party
leaders.
so
that
again
there
is,
as
to
dr.
aptheker,
a
long
history
of
intimate
association
with
the
party.
so
that
--
mr.
abram
chayes
it
says
--
i
think
it
said
as
to
both.
no,
i
am
sorry,
that's
mrs.
flynn
and
that's
the
only
one
i
can
--
i'll
supply
the
hearing
officer's
finding
as
to
dr.
aptheker.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
warren
that
there
is
really
any
basis
for
distinguishing
between
these
two
people.
mr.
abram
chayes
they
are
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
said,
functionaries
of
the
party.
they
are
intimately
connected
with
its
history
over
a
period
of
30
years.
if
the
statue
can
apply
to
anybody,
it
can
apply
--
it's
got
to
apply
to
them.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
but
i
want
--
think
that
it's
worth
pointing
to
the
court
and
it
cites
these
cases,
the
rowoldt
case,
the
gastelum-quinones
case,
which
we
have
just
been
discussing.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
mr.
justice
brennan
our
position
--
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
no
our
position
is
that
member
in
this
section
means
what
it
means
in
other
sections
of
the
same
statute,
and
that
therefore
“mere
membership”,
if
you
by
mere
membership
you
mean
unwitting
membership,
coerced
membership,
nominal
membership,
passive
membership,
take
the
terms
that
you
want,
is
not
precluded
by
this
statute
any
more
than
it
is
in
the
--
it
was
in
the
rowoldt
case.
mr.
abram
chayes
what
i
am
saying
is
exactly
that
mr.
justice
brennan.
i'm
saying
that
we
talk
about
a
standard
in
language,
but
as
you
recognize,
the
problem
is
on
the
case-by-case
determination
to
decide
to
apply
that
standard
to
cases,
and
it's
very
hard
to
talk
about
what
you
would
need
in
terms
of
evidence
to
get
you
over
the
line
without
having
seen
the
particular
case.
but
i
take
it
our
position
is
that
on
the
rowoldt
record
we
could
not
deny
passport,
yes.
and
i
take
it
first
--
mr.
abram
chayes
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
rowoldt
itself.
mr.
abram
chayes
oh
yeah,
it's
the
same
statute,
that's
the
point,
it's
just
the
second
title
of
the
same
statute.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
mr.
abram
chayes
i
think
the
board
referred
to
--
here
is
the
board
of
passport
appeals.
mr.
abram
chayes
and
you
can
--
mr.
abram
chayes
it's
only
referred
to
in
the
letters,
that
is
the
finding
of
the
board
of
passport
appeals.
mr.
abram
chayes
it
is
not
in
the
printed
record,
but
it
is
in
the
certified
record
that
has
been
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
abram
chayes
it
was
a
set
of
short
memorandum
and
finding.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
it
did
not,
it
accepted
the
findings
below.
the
--
mr.
abram
chayes
well,
they
did
not
purport
to
reject
any
i
think.
what
they
did
was,
in
effect,
it's
a
very
short
paper
coming
substantially
to
the
conclusory
finding
that
is
referred
to
in
these
records.
mr.
abram
chayes
we're
relying
on
the
finding
of
the
board
as
sustained
substantive
by
the
court
upon
review
and
–
mr.
abram
chayes
on
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
board.
mr.
abram
chayes
but
the
finding
of
the
fact
of
the
board
is
that
these
people
were
members
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue.
mr.
abram
chayes
our
argument
is
that
member
means
what
it
is
mean
the
statute,
in
that
finding,
and
therefore
--
and
if
anybody
is
a
member
within
the
meaning
of
that
test
as
prescribed
in
this
statute,
these
people
are.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
