chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
hearing
officer
hold
as
to
him,
did
he
hold
the
same
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
well
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
was
any
distinction
between
the
two
as
found
by
the
hearing
officer
and
that
has
some
bearing
perhaps
on
the
effect
of
the
finding
of
the
board
itself
where
they
said
that
we
find
it
to
be
a
member.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
board
find,
did
the
board
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
one
of
the
sections
as
i
recall
that
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
pass.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
might
never
want
to
take
this
risk,
why.
