justice

l.
black
did
congress
have
to
make
the
findings
of
fact
in
order
to
draft
the
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
depending
on
that
case
for
justifying
this
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible),
while
this
statute
bars
the
members
of
the
party
(inaudible),
and
they
want
to
travel
abroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
have
to
be
rational?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
hear
it
correct
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
there
you
said
that
you
didn't
have
to
depend
much
charge
on
whether
or
not
it's
rational
to
do
this
if
you
assume
the
government
had
the
right
to
put
a
party
out
of
business.
of
course
it's
rational,
it's
rational
to
do
every
one
of
the
things
that
had
been
done
and
many
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
that
argument
has
--
why
you
have
to
struggle
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government
has
the
power
to
put
the
party
out
of
business
in
this
way,
everybody
in
it,
it
can
do
that
in
many
more
things.
they
could
put
them
all
out
of
jobs,
keep
them
from
getting
jobs,
as
has
been
frequently
attempted
and
in
many
respects
it
has
been
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
keep
them
from
morning
run.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
about
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
object?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
shouldn't
it
has
the
power
to
do
it,
which
is
dangerous
that
you
say
they
found
it
to
be.
i
don't
understand
that,
you
are
not
to
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
to
pass
on
that
weighing
the
circumstances
each
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
that
depends
on
whether
we
think
that
what
they
did
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
makes
us
the
final
arbiter
of
whether
a
law
is
constitutional,
despite
what
the
constitution
--
what
the
congress
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
such
an
easy
word
for
determining
whether
something
violates
the
constitution,
it's
likes
those
easy
words
that
allow
you
to
bypass
the
words
of
a
constitutional
provision
such
as
irrational
and
capricious.
it's
always
easy
to
find
that
one
way
or
the
other,
you
don't
have
to
cover
much
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
does
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
none
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
none
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress,
instead
of
passing
this
law
as
it
did,
had
passed
a
law
that
said
that
any
person
who
has
certain
beliefs
shall
be
denied
a
passport
and
did
not
give
him
a
jury
trial,
would
that
violate
his
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why,
because
it's
a
just
a
number
of
people
instead
of
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
might
be
a
--
it
might
be
a
little
more
difficult
here
because
the
law,
constitution
does
say
something
about
the
right
of
assembly
which
all
the
courts
have
taken,
to
me,
a
right
of
people
to
join
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
something
about
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
government
does
something
to
somebody,
isn't
he
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
--
they
put
at
the
end
of
the
act,
this
is
a
criminal
penalty,
and
if
he
believes
this,
he
has
certain
beliefs
the
government
will
--
the
secretary
will
deny,
in
his
discretion,
a
passport.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
is
prohibiting
these
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
prohibiting
them
going
abroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
regulating
it
by
prohibiting
them
or
keeping
them
from
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
law
was
just
the
same
and
you
had
to
try
person
by
person,
would
they
be
entitled
to
an
indictment
or
a
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
talking
about
according
to
the
(inaudible)
it's
supposed
to
be
over
the
legislative
balance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
they
can
--
secretary
could
call
any
of
us
down
there
at
any
time,
we
wanted
a
passport,
he
say
well
you
have
certain
beliefs
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
have
these
beliefs
you
can't
have
a
passport.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
have
said
we
want
a
jury
to
try
this
out
not
you,
the
administrative
agency
we
couldn't
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
--
it's
necessary
now
and
then
to
remember
that
there
is
something
that's
open
to
power
of
congress,
namely
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
i'm
asking
you
if
the
government
can
take
things
away
that
are
of
value
to
a
citizen
without
giving
him
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
individually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
--
this
court
upheld
the
right
of
the
government
to
draft
denial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
can't
draft
denial.
it's
not
doing
anything
to
them
except
what
it
does
that
everybody
alike.
they
are
not
leaving
it
up
to
a
single
administrative
agency
or
man
or
somebody
he
appoints
maybe
he
never
seen
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
pass
on
what
his
beliefs
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
decide
to
do
it
perfectly
rational,
and
it
would
be
rational
to
try
them
separately.
are
you
going
to
let
them
be
tried
by
an
administrative
agency
for
their
beliefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
it?
if
you
were
asking
for
a
passport,
and
they
got
you
before
an
administrative
agency,
they
charge
you
with
having
bad
beliefs
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
were
trying
you
when
they
put
on
evidence
before
an
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly,
when
you
have
a
law
that
presents
a
governmental
power
and
applies
to
everybody
alike,
and
you
follow
the
procedures
which
the
constitution
outlines.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whether
you
--
punishment
is
a
broad
word
and
includes
many
things.
i
think
i
would
consider
it
a
pretty
severe
punishment,
if
i
want
to
go
abroad
and
they
say
that
my
beliefs
were
such,
that
i
couldn't
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
even
a
civil
case,
if
the
man
has
a
civil
case
against
him,
he
has
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
aliens
and
they
drew
a
distinction
there
wherever
they
say
aliens,
did
they
say
aliens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
that
a
non-alien
could
be
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
is
not
premised
on
the
first
amendment,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
is
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
and
if
the
government
creates
something,
i
don't
know
what
they
designate
it,
criminal
offense
or
just
anything
in
theory,
the
argument
of
the
government
here
has
to
be
that
the
government
can't
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
travel
on
account
of
disputed
fact
for
what
they
believe,
by
letting
a
single
administrator
pass
on
those
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
a
full
hearing,
but
the
constitution
provides
the
kind
of
full
hearing
a
citizen
is
entitled
to,
before
he
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
all
depends
then
on
the
semantic
meaning
of
the
word
punish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
case
hold,
i've
forgotten,
did
that
case
hold
if
they
hadn't
decided
it
was
a
punishment,
they
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
leads
you
to
the
point
that
it
is
the
most
substanding
citizen
in
the
united
states
against
whom
there
was
no
block
on
his
(inaudible),
never
had
been,
they
want
to
take
away
his
citizenship,
can
be
done
by
an
administrative
agency
without
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
case
to
which
you
refer
mr.
justice
goldberg
wrote
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
--
did
it
hold
that,
i
forget.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
say
would
have
been
the
result
if
it
had
not
been
considered
to
be
full
punishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
so,
did
he
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
it's
--
you
mean
it's
not
been
intended
to
keep
them
from
going
aboard
because,
as
here,
that
he
may
converge
with
somebody
about
his
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
you
agree
that
just
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
is
not
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
is
a
member,
he
is
a
member
of
that
party,
that's
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
got
to
hold
it
over
the
heads
of
all
of
them,
so
that
each
time
you
can
say
well
there
is
enough
on
this
one,
but
never
get
the
other
types
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
it
as
that
way,
and
an
ancient
bill
of
attainder
such
as
they
had
many
times
in
england
and
scotland
and
ireland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
a
legislative
determination
on
findings
which
they
sometimes
made
and
sometimes
didn't
that
a
whole
group
of
people
were
tainted,
some
of
them
had
to
be
ostracized,
some
of
them
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
go
within
10
miles
of
london
or
whatever
it
was,
some
of
them
would
be
tried
for
one
thing
or
another.
but
it
was
a
legislative
determination
on
their
finding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suspect
you
rely
very
heavily
on
the
finding
of
congress
that's
the
reason
i
ask
you
about
it
a
lot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
turn
that
over
to
the
administrator.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
does
that
in
england
when
they
proscribed
--
had
a
proscription
but
no
catholics
should
come
within
--
no
catholic
priest
should
come
within
10
miles
of
london,
he
could
have
resigned
his
priesthood
and
gone
to
london.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
chayes
what
is
the
practice
of
the
department
so
for
as
the
prohibiting
passports
to
mere
members
of
the
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there
is
no
practice.
