mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
take
up
our
contention
that
section
6
on
its
face
and
as
applied
violates
the
first
amendment.
and
first
i
would
like
take
up
and
explain
our
position
as
to
the
various
ways
in
which
section
6
interferes
with
speech
and
association.
and
i
think
that
this
is
desirable
because
of
the
position
taken
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
the
government
argues
that
section
6
is
just
a
travel
control
statute,
that
all
it
controls
is
the
conduct
of
travelling,
and
that
any
restrictions
on
speech
and
association
are
only
incidental
or
byproducts.
the
fact
is
however
that
section
6
is
and
was
meant
to
be
both
a
direct
and
indirect
restraint
of
first
amendment
rights.
now
on
the
first
place
this
appears
from
section
2
(8)
of
the
act,
which,
as
mr.
abt
pointed
out,
states
the
purpose
of
section
6.
and
that
purpose,
as
mr.
abt
has
already
stated,
is
to
prevent
american
communist
from
communication
with
foreign
communist
because
it
was
felt
that
out
of
such
communication
something
might
happen
to
facilitate
the
coming
of
revolution
in
this
country.
so
the
theory
of
section
6
isn't
that
communist
create
a
danger
by
the
fact
of
their
travel
or
by
the
mode
of
their
travel,
the
way
speeding
automobile
drivers
do.
the
theory
of
section
6
is
that
the
danger
arose
from
what
communist
who
travelled
would
do
after
they
arrived
at
their
destination.
and
that
danger
was
speaking
to
and
associating
with
foreign
communists,
which
of
course
is
speech
and
association.
and
in
fact
section
6
does
prevent
american
communist
from
meeting
and
speaking
with
foreign
communist.
so,
section
6
is
a
direct
and
intended
restraint
on
the
speech
and
association
of
american
communists
and
what
is
incidental
is
the
section's
effect
on
travel.
now,
of
course
section
6
doesn't
just
restraint
communist
from
talking
to
other
communists,
not
everybody
in
europe
is
a
communist.
it
therefore
restraints
american
communist
from
talking
to
non-communist,
and
section
6
also
imposes
like
restraints
on
non-communists
who
happened
to
be
members
of
organizations
down
by
the
subversive
activities
control
board
to
be
communist-front
organizations
or
who
are
people
who
aren't
members
of
anything,
but
who
are
people
concerning
whom
the
passport
office
has
or
thinks
it
has
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
members
of
prescribed
organization,
but
it
further
affects
on
first
amendment
rights
indeed,
as
illustrated
by
the
situation
here
that
the
appellants
want
to
go
to
europe
to
study
and
to
observe.
so,
section
6
is
preventing
them
not
only
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
right
to
speak
and
to
associate
but
also
their
first
amendment
right
to
learn.
the
situation
is
no
different
as
far
as
appellants
is
concerned
if
they
were
confronted
with
law
that
prohibited
them
from
going
to
libraries
or
universities
or
lecture
halls
or
bookstores.
in
addition
to
that,
appellants
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
but
you
see
dr.
aptheker
who
wants
to
go
to
the
british
museum
to
look
at
source
material
that
is
not
available
in
this
country.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
would
be
different.
cia
could
keep
anybody
out
that
it
is
chose
too,
but
that
doesn't
enable,
i
mean
it's
a
clear
interference
with
first
amendment
rights
to
say
that
you
can't
go,
not
only
to
any
library
but
to
a
specific
library.
now
may
i
say
this,
at
the
moment
i
am
not
even
arguing
whether
or
not
these
interferences
violate
the
principles
of
the
first
amendment
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
all
i
am
trying
to
do
now
is
to
show
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem
here
because
there
are
these
various
aspects
of
the
first
amendment
--
first
amendment
interest
which
section
6
invades.
and
what
i
was
trying
to
show
is
that
section
6
doesn't
just
prevent
people
from
traveling,
it
prevents
them
from
learning
as
well
as
from
talking
and
as
well
as
from
associating,
and
of
course
it
doesn't
just
prevent
--
mr.
joseph
forer
of
course
it
does,
in
the
sense
people
are
entitled
to
learn.
now,
the
people
that
started
the
revolution,
the
american
revolution
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that
the
british
museum
isn't
subject
to
our
constitution,
but
this
is
the
united
states
government
that's
preventing
dr.
aptheker
from
going
to
the
british
museum,
and
it
is
preventing
him
from
going
to
the
british
museum
while
allowing
other
people
to
go.
and
by
preventing
dr.
aptheker,
and
ms.
flynn
from
going
to
europe
and
learning,
it
is
also
preventing
them
from
coming
back
and
teaching
to
people
in
this
country
what
they
have
learned
and
both
of
them
are
in
the
business
of
teaching
people
what
they
learn,
both
of
them
are
writers
and
lecturers.
so
it
is
a
fact
that
section
6
is
interfering
with
the
first
amendment
right
to
hear
and
the
first
amendment
right
to
learn
of
the
potential
readers
and
listeners,
communists
and
non-communists
or
like
who
might
be
interested
in
reading
or
listening
to
dr.
aptheker
and
mrs.
flynn.
now
in
addition
to
these
restraints
which
i
prescribe
and
which
we
consider
to
be
direct,
section
6
also
deters
the
first
amendment
right
of
association
within
the
united
states,
and
this
is
so
of
course
because
the
disability
to
travel
arises
from
section
6
solely
out
of
an
exercise
of
the
right
of
association,
that
is
membership
in
a
prescribed
organization.
and
this
deterrence
not
only
discourages
people
from
joining
organizations,
which
subversive
activities
control
board
has
actually
found
to
be
a
communist-action
or
a
communist-front
organization.
it
also
operates
to
deter
them
from
organizations
against
which
proceedings
are
pending
or
against
which
some
proceeding
might
conceivably
be
instituted.
and
it
also
discourages
people
from
cooperating
with
or
participating
in
the
activities
of
suspected
organizations
or
organizations
which
might
be
suspected,
or
participating
in
their
activities
in
ways
short
of
membership,
because
of
the
possibility
that
such
cooperation
or
participation
might
be
interpreted
by
the
passport
office
as
giving
the
office
reason
to
believe
that
in
fact
they
are
them.
and
finally,
the
section
also
intrudes
on
interests
of
conscience
and
privacy.
it
makes
the
association
of
every
would
be
traveler
a
matter
of
public
business
and
a
subject
of
government
surveillance,
and
it
subjects
every
would
be
traveler
to
the
possible
indignity
of
a
loyalty
test
or
a
political
test
before
he
can
qualify
to
travel.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
forer
you
mean
that's
all
the
statute
said?
yes
i
certainly
would,
by
all
mean.
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
as
an
indiscriminate
and
purposeless
restriction
on
its
liberty
and
i
also
think
it
would
interfere
the
first
amendment.
it
would
involve
a
great
many
of
these
things
that
i
have
mentioned
including
the
necessity
for
the
government
to
determine
whether
every
traveler
is
or
is
not
a
communist.
now
i
have
mentioned
the
several
different
ways
both
direct
and
indirect
in
which
we
think
that
section
6
interferes
very
substantially
with
the
first
amendment
interests
of
both
communist
and
non-communists,
and
now
i
want
to
come
to
the
theoretical
bases
on
which
we
think
those
interferences
violate
the
first
amendment.
now
one
principle
which
is
clear
under
the
first
amendment
and
which
is
a
common
place,
whatever
else
maybe
obscure
about
the
first
amendment,
is
the
principle
of
precision
of
regulation.
as
i
say,
this
court
has
stated
again
and
again
that
where
the
first
amendment
area
is
concerned,
the
government
must
regulate
narrowly
and
that
it
may
not
as
might
in
cases
of
regulation
subject
only
to
due
process
for
reasons
of
administrative
efficiency,
control
or
burden
the
exercise
protected
rights
in
order
to
aid
the
regulation
of
unprotected
conduct,
nor
may
it,
in
the
first
amendment
area,
ignore
the
availability
of
less
drastic
means
for
achieving
the
same
basic
purposes.
now
section
6
is
so
broad
that
it
obviously
violates
this
principle.
it
bars
the
travel
not
only
of
people
who
are
going
abroad
for
criminal
or
dangerous
purposes,
but
also
of
people
who
wish
to
go
abroad,
as
here,
for
innocuous
and
protected
purposes.
if
the
government
could
not
make
it
a
crime
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
i
am
sure
it
could
not,
it
couldn't
make
it
a
crime
for
dr.
aptheker
to
study
at
the
british
museum
and
it
couldn't
make
it
a
crime
for
ms.
flynn
to
look
at
the
paintings
at
the
louvre,
by
the
same
token
the
government
cannot
impose
a
prior
restraint
on
dr.
aptheker
and
ms.
flynn
from
going
to
the
museum
or
going
to
the
louvre
for
those
purposes.
now
this
excessive
breadth
of
section
6
is
the
inevitable
result
of
the
indirect,
and
i
may
say,
even
perverse
manner
in
which
congress
chose
to
legislation.
on
the
one
hand
congress
said
its
purpose
is
to
prevent
conspiratorial
communication.
but
section
6
doesn't
prohibit
or
punish
conspiratorial
communication.
there
is
nothing
to
stop,
so
far
as
section
6
is
concerned,
any
number
of
individuals
from
traveling
aboard
for
the
purposes
of
the
conspiring
to
engage
in
dangerous
activities
or
to
bring
revolution
to
this
country.
mr.
joseph
forer
theoretically
she
would,
she'd
have
an
awful
time
getting
one,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
no
that's
right
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
you
can
get
your
due
process
constitutional
liberty
to
travel
provided
you
surrender
your
first
amendment
right
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
certainly,
people
have
the
first
amendment
right
to
be
members
of
political
parties.
now
you
don't
have
a
right
to
be
a
member
of
a
party
with
knowledge
and
intent
that
this
party
is
going
to
engage
in
dangerous
activity.
but
as
i
understand
from
the
scales
case
all
the
--
even
the
cases
which
upheld
convictions
of
communist,
from
the
douds
case,
now
of
course
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
order
to
engage
in
its
peaceable
political
activities
which
nobody
doubts
that
it
does
engage.
now,
so
by
this
perverse
mechanism,
the
statute
instead
of
prohibiting
what
it
said
it
was
after,
that
is
going
abroad
for
conspiratorial
communication,
all
it
did
is
prohibit
people
from
going
abroad
merely
because
they
are
members
of
certain
organizations.
now
even
the
government
recognizes
in
its
brief
that
it
is
inconceivable
and
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
every
communist
will,
every
time
he
goes
abroad,
engage
in
dangerous
talk
or
activity.
therefore,
it
automatically
follows
that
section
6
inevitably
suppresses
a
great
volume
of
protected
speech
and
association
along
with
whatever
slight
amount
of
unprotected
communication
it
might
speculatively
prevent.
now
the
government
and
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
appear
to
justify
this
approach
on
the
ground
that
congress
could
reasonably
believe
that
the
communist
party
is
a
bad
organization.
but
even
if
it
were
true,
that
would
not
permit
congress
constitutionally
to
prevent
communist
from
engaging
in
peaceable
speech
and
association
or
to
punish
them
for
doing
so,
because
it
is
unconstitutional
to
abridge
the
protected
speech
and
association,
not
because
of
the
nature
of
the
speech
or
the
association,
but
because
of
the
identity
of
the
speaker
and
even
more
so
because
of
the
identity
of
the
organization
to
which
he
belongs.
and
i
thought
this
was
settled
as
far
back
as
1937
in
de
jonge
against
oregon.
and
there
the
court
held
that
even
assuming
that
the
communist
party
was
guilty
of
criminal
syndicalism,
the
state
could
not,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
punish
persons,
members
of
the
communist
party
for
conducting
peaceable
party
meetings.
now
in
fact
section
6
goes
beyond
the
oregon
statute
that
de
jonge
invalidated.
after
all,
mr.
de
jonge
in
this
meeting
that
he
was
conducted
and
which
was
held
to
be
beyond
the
state's
reach,
mr.
de
jonge
was
carrying
on
communist
party
business
when
he
conducted
this
protected
meeting.
he
was
running
a
meeting
to
protest
anti-strike
activity
which
was
sponsored
by
the
party
and
he
urged
the
audience
to
join
the
party.
but
section
6
is
broader,
because
it
applies
to
members
of
the
communist
party
even
when
they
desire
to
travel
abroad
for
reasons
unconnected
with
party
business.
furthermore,
the
statute
in
de
jonge
required
the
state
to
prove
that
the
communist
party
advocated
criminal
syndicalism.
but
section
6
doesn't
require
any
proof
that
the
communist
party
engages
in
any
criminal
conduct
or
that
it
engages
in
any
advocacy
which
is
of
an
unprotected
nature.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
subversive
activities
control
board,
which
is
no
friend
of
the
communist
party,
after
lengthy
hearings
was
unable
to
find
and
did
not
find
that
the
communist
party
engages
in
criminal
activities
or
in
incitement
for
violent
overthrow.
now
these
defects
to
section
6,
including
that
it's
too
broad
because
it
also
applies
as
mr.
abt
pointed
to
members
who
are
innocent,
as
well
as
guilty,
are
magnified
by
the
fact
that
it
is
a
prior
as
well
as
indiscriminate
restraint.
in
near
against
minnesota,
the
court
struck
down
as
a
prior
restraint,
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
circulation
of
future
issues
of
a
newspaper
which
had
published
previous
scandalous
issues.
now
section
6
is
more
extreme.
it
prohibits
the
circulation
of
persons,
not
because
of
any
past
misconduct
of
theirs,
but
because
of
suspected
misconduct
by
other
people
in
their
organization.
now
i
think
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
reason
why
section
6
violates
the
first
amendment
is
that
it
is
simply
incompatible
with
the
amendment
that
people
should
have
to
pass
loyalty
or
political
tests
as
a
condition
to
their
engaging
in
peacetime
in
the
elementary
human
right
of
freedom
of
locomotion.
now
the
court
has
upheld
loyalty
screening
and
persons
holding
public
office
or
for
what
it
considered
quasi
public
jobs
such
as
labor
union
offices.
but
here
the
loyalty
screening
is
being
applied
for
the
purpose
of
determining
who
could
engage
in
purely
private
pursuits.
if
i
can
borrow
the
language
of
the
economists,
here
the
loyalty
purge
or
loyalty
test
is
being
--
and
the
loyalty
apparatus
is
being
extended
from
the
public
sector
to
the
private
sector.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
wouldn't
consider
that
a
loyalty
or
a
political
test.
if
they
--
you
would
there
get
into
the
problem
of
preventive
detention,
but
leaving
that
aside,
if
you
could
punish
--
and
you
have
the
problem
of
prior
restraint,
it
may
be
that
the
secretary
of
state
could
be
given
authority
to
prevent
people
from
going
abroad
to
engage
in
physical
violence,
espionage,
and
so
forth.
but
just
to
prevent
people
from
going
abroad
because
of
that
politics
is
something
different.
and
the
fact
is
if
congress
can
impose
these
political
tests
on
people
seeking
to
travel
abroad,
because
it
doesn't
like
communists
or
think
they're
dangerous
or
communist-front
organization,
then
it
can
also
impose
loyalty
or
political
tests
as
a
condition
to
people
engaging
in
the
pursuits
of
driving
automobiles
or
to
people
travelling
in
the
subways
or
to
people
buying
food.
now
i'm
sure
it
is
just
as
important
to
the
communist
movement
that
officials
of
the
communist
party
be
able
to
drive
automobiles,
travel
in
subways,
or
buy
food
as
it
is
for
them
to
travel
abroad.
and
yet
if
congress
can
impose
these
kind
of
political
and
loyalty
test
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
person
is
doing
or
going
to
do,
but
just
political
considerations,
if
it
can
transport
the
government
loyalty
test
to
all
these
private
everyday
activities,
then
we
just
have
to
stop
pretending
that
we
have
a
free
society
because
everybody
is
subject
to
a
loyalty
test
for
everything
he
does.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
it's
about
travelling,
which
is
a
fundamental
human
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
if
the
secretary
of
state
tomorrow
should
decide
to
require
passports
to
canada,
mexico,
and
so
forth
then
automatically
section
6
would
be
applicable
to
the
rest
of
the
country.
so
it's
preventing
people
from
going
to
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no
but
the
person
--
mr.
joseph
forer
now
the
principle
is
the
same,
the
principle
is
of
imposing
loyalty
tests
on
people
who
are
going
abroad,
travelling
for
private
purposes,
on
the
justification
that
people
going
abroad
might
do
harm.
what
i
was
pointing
out
that
the
justification
for
controlling
them
from
travelling
on
the
subway
is
even
stronger.
it's
a
much
more
factless
thing
just
to
prevent
them
from
going
to
europe,
if
you
really
want
to
stop
them
from
being
dangerous,
you
just
stop
them
from
doing
anything,
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
suspect
that
some
of
the
justices
are
joined
in
the
japanese
relocation
cases
may
have
second
thoughts
about
it
at
this
late
stage,
but
in
any
event
those
cases
were
upheld
purely
as
an
extraordinary
exercise
of
the
war
power
because
of
war
condition.
we
will
reserve
the
rest
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
