do
i
understand
mr.
chayes,
you
are
suggesting
that
if
we
agree
with
the
government's
position,
we
do
it
only
in
the
context
of
proof
of
meaningful
membership
and

if
it's
an

is
only

what
basis
you
want
to
put
on

that
then
the
passport
issue
will
not
be
revoked,
is
that
that
what
you're
telling
me?

so
forth.
