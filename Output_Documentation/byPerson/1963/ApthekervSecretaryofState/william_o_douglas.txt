justice
william
o.
douglas
in
the
edwards
case,
edwards
versus
california,
the
court
i
think
had
the
power
to
restrict
travel
of
citizens
inside
the
country
on
the
commerce
clause.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
a
minority
view
i
think
in
that
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
was
wondering
if
you
could,
under
the
theory,
you
now
advance
whatever
commerce
power,
foreign
commerce
or
what
not,
whether
you
could
justify
an
act
of
congress
that
would
make
all
members
of
the
communist
party
in-house
custody
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean
in
their
own
house.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
instead
of
a
house
custody
perhaps
within
a
radius
say
10
miles
from
their
house.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's,
that
would
--
that's
on
the
war
power.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
i
do
--
kill
them
of
communication
or
preventing
or
affording
or
making
it
more
difficult,
that
would
i
think
strike
really
deep?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
think
that
these
people
could
have
got
a
passport
if
they
had
shown
that
their
parents
were
dying
in
paris?
justice
william
o.
douglas
had
any
exceptions
been
made?
