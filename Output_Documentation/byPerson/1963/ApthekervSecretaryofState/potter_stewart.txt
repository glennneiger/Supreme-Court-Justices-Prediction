insofar
as
the
actual
issuance
of
the
passport
goes,
the
secretary
apparently
has
no
discretionary
latitude
at
all.
in
fact
he
can,
under
the
terms
of
15
(c),
he
is
sentenced
to
five
years
in
prison.
justice

both
of
these
--
both
of
these
appellants
are
native
born
citizens?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
abt
is
it
open
to
your
appellants
to
assert
the
claims
on
behalf
of
these
hypothetical
people?
your
appellants,
not
having
introduced
any
such
evidence
as
to
their
lack
of
belief
or
their
--
to
put
them
in
the
position
of
people
who
have
a
reason
to
travel
to
europe
to
see
a
sick
wife
or
so
on.
those
are
hypothetical
people
who
are
not
before
us,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
declined
to
offer
any
evidence
at
all,
didn't
they,
at
the
administrative
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
are
referring
to
people
who
could
have
established
by
evidence
that
they
had
no
knowledge
at
all
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
communist
party,
they
still
lack
--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
that
certainly
does
not
cover
these
appellants.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know.
they
didn't
offer
any
evidence,
you
don't
know
what
they
might
have
been
permitted
to
offer.
they
didn't
offer
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
literally
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i'm
not
only
pointing
out
that
you
don't
have
that
particular
kind
of
case
here,
because
there
was
no
such
evidence
properly.
justice
potter
stewart
this
statute
was
not
on
the
books
at
all,
would
the
secretary
have
any
power
under
existing
other
regulations
and
statutes
to
consider
withholding
and
to
withhold
the
passports
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
kent
was
not
under
then
existing
regulations
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
hypothesis
of
the
argument
that
you
are
now
making
is
that
the
refusal
to
issue
a
passport
to
a
would-be
traveler
aboard
is
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
are
you
the?
you
say
you
can't
punish
the
man.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
good
rhetoric
but
it
is
quite
different,
because
there
are
good
many
libraries,
and
lecture
halls,
and
bookstores
here
in
the
united
states
which
are
available.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
he
wanted
to
go
over
to
some
secret
installation
in
the
cia
to
do
its
research?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
stop
pretending
that
this
case
is
about
buying
food
or
travelling
in
subways
too,
because
it
isn't.
justice
potter
stewart
outside
north
america.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
going
to
the
grocery
store
and
buying
food
and
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
let's
just
say,
case
is
before
us,
which
is
difficult
enough.
justice
potter
stewart
what
impediment
upon
freedom
of
association
do
you
concede
the
freedom
to
associate
in
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
or
the
freedom
to
associate
abroad
with
other
communists
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
am
not
sure
i
thoroughly
understand
what
you
say
--
the
basic
source
of
congressional
power.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
war
power?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
the
implicit
power
to
regulate
foreign
relation?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
am
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
the
commerce
power?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
know
where
you
found
it
in
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
it
strikes
me
that
the
distinction
you
are
now
making
has
got
things
turn
around.
i
had
always
thought
that
most
people
were
of
the
view
that
prior
restrain
without
trial
was
a
more,
more
serious
impairment
of
free
speech
and
subsequent
conviction
after
the
speech
had
been
delivered
and
with
the
conviction
with
all
the
charges
of
a
criminal
term.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case.
you
told
as
much
earlier
in
your
(inaudible)
rowoldt
and
perfetto
case
and
all
of
it.
