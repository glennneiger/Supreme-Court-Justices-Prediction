mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
of
three
judge
court
sitting
in
the
district
of
columbia
denying
appellants'
motion
for
summary
judgment
granting
the
government's
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissing
the
complaints.
the
complaints
sought
judgments
declaring
section
6
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
unconstitutional
enjoining
the
secretary
of
state
from
continuing,
in
effect,
his
revocation
of
the
appellants'
passports
and
ordering
him
to
reissue
passports
to
them.
the
single
question
that
the
case
presents
is
whether
section
6
of
subversive
activities
control
act
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
or
as
applied.
section
6
(a)
of
the
act
provides
that
when
a
final
order
has
been
issued
requiring
an
organization
to
register
under
section
7
of
the
act
as
a
communist-action
or
a
communist-front
organization,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
member
of
the
organization,
who
has
knowledge
or
notice
of
this
order,
to
apply
for
use
or
attempt
to
use
a
passport.
section
6
(b)
provides
that
when
a
final
order
is
in
effect
requiring
an
organization
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization,
section
6(b)
doesn't
apply
to
fronts,
a
communist-action
organization,
it
shall
then
be
unlawful
for
any
employee
of
the
federal
government
to
issue
a
passport
to
any
person
who
he
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
is
a
member
of
the
organization.
violations
of
section
6
are
punishable
by
fine
and
imprisonment
under
section
15.
now
there's
no
dispute
about
the
facts.
in
april
of
1953,
the
subversive
activities
control
board
ordered
the
communist
party
of
united
states
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
that
order
became
final
in
october
of
1961
after
this
court
denied
a
rehearing
in
communist
party
versus
the
sacb
in
which
it
had
affirmed
the
board's
order.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
government
claims
that
there
is,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
disagree.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
state
pursuant
to
the
authority
given
in
the
presidential
proclamation,
which
put
into
effect
the
section
of
the
law,
which
makes
travel
abroad
without
a
passport
unlawful.
a
provision
of
the
regulation
that
the
secretary
may,
in
his
complete
discretion
when
he
thinks
the
national
interest
so
requires,
that
he
may
authorize
travel
without
a
passport.
now
that
authorization
while
it
might
relieve
the
traveler
of
criminal
prosecution
for
leaving
or
reentering
the
country
without
a
passport
but
by
no
means
assure
him
of
entry
into
a
foreign
country
because
at
least
out
of
the
western
hemisphere
most
countries
require
the
traveler
to
have
the
passport.
and
unless
the
foreign
country
waive
this
provision,
the
secretary's
waiver
wouldn't
permit
travel,
in
addition
to
which
of
course
that
would
–
the
whole
–
this
whole
provision
of
the
regulation
is
simply
a
matter
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
secretary,
it's
not
a
matter
of
right
on
the
part
of
the
applicant.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
can
get
five
years
in
jail
for
issuing
a
passport
if
he
has
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
applicant
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
in
january
1962,
following
of
the
denial
of
the
rehearing
in
the
party
case,
the
passport
office
notified
the
appellants
that
their
passports
have
been
revoked
on
the
ground
that
use
of
them
would
violate
section
6.
the
appellants
sought
and
secured
administrative
review
of
this
--
of
these
relocations
pursuant
to
the
department
of
regulations.
at
the
administrative
hearings,
the
department
offered
evidence
that
each
of
the
appellants
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
had
notice
of
the
final
registration
order
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
published
in
the
federal
register.
the
appellants
offered
no
evidence
at
the
administrative
hearing.
the
administrative
proceedings
culminated
in
a
decision
by
the
secretary,
in
which
he
found
that
the
appellants
were
members
of
the
communist
party
with
knowledge
or
notice
of
the
existence
of
this
final
registration
order,
and
hence
that
their
use
of
passports
would
violate
section
6
and
accordingly
he
confirmed
his
revocation,
the
revocation
order.
now,
i
may
say
that
the
secretary
made
no
finding
and,
of
course,
section
6
requires
none
as
to
the
character
of
appellant's
membership
in
the
organization
as
to
their
knowledge
and
attempt
their
activity,
any
other
factor
beyond
the
bare
fact
of
their
membership.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
court
below
found
mr.
justice
harlan
that
dr.
aptheker
is
the
or
was
at
the
time
the
editor
of
political
affairs,
which
is
the
theoretical
journal
of
the
communist
party
and
that
ms.
flynn
was
the
chairman
of
the
communist
party.
it
found
that
from
evidence
introduced
at
the
hearing
and
in
the
administrative
record,
but
the
secretary's
finding
was
based
solely
on
his
finding
of
the
bare
fact
of
membership,
and
under
the
statute,
the
fact,
if
it
is
fact
that
the
appellants
are
leading
members
of
the
communist
party,
plays
a
role
in
the
issue,
the
question
of
their
right
to
passport.
mr.
john
j.
abt
mrs.
flynn
is
the
individual,
under
the
smith
act,
in
the
case
that
you
decided
in
the
second
circuit
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
again,
there
was
no
such,
no
finding
in
the
administrative
record
to
that
effect
and
under
section
6
it's
utterly
immaterial
as
to
who
she
was
other
than
the
fact
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
it
appears
to
me
from
the
record
in
the
proceedings
in
the
three-judge
court,
that
dr.
aptheker
is
a
professional
historian,
is
the
author
of
many
books
and
studies
in
his
field.
the
revocation
of
his
passport
has
prevented
him
from
tendering
gatherings
of
historians
in
europe
and
africa,
denied
him
access
which
he
desires
to
overseas
his
archives
and
depositories
which
he
needs
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
pursuing
his
historical
studies
and
has
prevented
him
from
accepting
invitations
to
lecture
on
historical
subject
at
universities
abroad.
ms.
flynn
has
for
many
years
written
a
column
for
the
newspaper,
the
worker,
she
is
the
author
of
several
books
and
a
speaker,
and
a
lecturer,
and
she
desires
to
travel
to
europe
as
she
has
done
in
the
past
both
for
rest
and
recreation
and
to
gather
material
for
writing
and
speaking
in
this
country.
now
i
shall
say
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
both
are
native
born
citizens,
yes.
i
should
say
that
appellants'
passports
would
have
expired
by
their
terms
while
the
case
was
pending
below
but
as
the
government
agrees,
this
fact
doesn't
moot
the
case
obviously
because
their
applications
from
new
passports
were
not
only
have
been
futile
but
would,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
have
subjected
them
to
a
criminal
prosecution
from
the
bare
act
of
making
the
application.
turning
then
first
to
the
substantive
due
process
question
which
this
case
presents.
as
i
noted
existing
united
states
law
and
the
laws
of
most
foreign
states
prevent
citizens
from
travelling
at
least
outside
of
the
western
hemisphere
without
passports.
the
denial
of
the
passport
therefore
is
a
prohibition
of
foreign
travel.
as
the
court
held
in
kent
versus
dulles,
foreign
travel
is
a
part
of
the
liberty
of
the
citizen
which
protected
by
due
process.
section
6
must
therefore
satisfy
the
due
process
requirement
that
a
depravation
of
liberty
may
not
be
arbitrary
and
that
it
must
bare
some
substantial
and
reasonable
relation
to
a
legitimate
legislative
objective.
now,
the
object
of
congress,
the
legislative
objective
and
the
enactment
of
section
6,
is
stated
in
the
section
2
(8)
of
the
act,
which
appears
at
page
54
of
our
brief.
that
object
was
to
protect
the
national
security
by
closing
of
a
means
of
communication
between
american
and
foreign
communists,
that
is
to
say
by
preventing
their
face-to-face
contact
at
least
in
europe,
which
form
of
communication
congress
found,
and
i
quote
now
from
section
2
(8)
‘is
a
prerequisite
for
the
carrying
on
of
activities
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
communist
movement.'
and
elsewhere
as
the
court
knows
in
section
2,
congress
found
that
these
purposes
of
the
communist
movement
are
a
threat
to
the
national
security.
thus,
section
6
was
enacted
by
congress
as
a
security
measure.
the
government
defends
it
here
as
a
security
measure
and
it
must
be
adjudged
therefore,
and
it
must
stand
or
fall
as
a
security
measure.
so
judged,
i
submit,
section
6
must
fall
as
an
arbitrary
depravation
of
a
personal
liberty
which
finds
no
justification
in
any
genuine
security
need.
this
is
so
in
the
first
place
because
as
i've
already
pointed
out
the
depravation
of
section
6
is
based
on
nothing
but
the
bare
fact
of
membership
in
an
organization
which
is
found
to
be
an
action
or
a
front
organization.
thus,
the
section
bars
travel
by
a
member
who
has
and
who
if
you
were
given
the
opportunity
could
establish
that
he
has
a
perfectly
legitimate
and
even
a
vitally
necessary
reason
for
travelling
aboard.
again,
the
section
prohibits
travel
by
members
who
have
never
engaged
and
who
do
not
intend
to
engage
and
who
could
have
established
that
fact
if
they
were
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so
an
unlawful
activity
of
any
kind,
either
this
in
country
or
abroad,
and
for
whom
to
use
mr.
justice
harlan's
phrase
in
the
scales
case,
the
organization
is
a
vehicle
for
legitimate
political
activity.
similarly,
it's
completely
irrelevant
under
section
6
that
the
member
does
not
know
or
believe
that
the
organization
engages
in
any
illegitimate
activity
of
any
kind
or
that
it
has
any
of
the
sinister
characteristic
that
the
act
and
the
board's
order
attributed
to
it.
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
are
not
hypothetical
people,
they
are
the
real
people
that
are
before
this
court
mr.
justice
stewart,
these
appellants
because
they
had
no
opportunity
to
make
such
a
showing
and
if
they
had
offered
such
a
showing
it
would
have
been
held
irrelevant
and
it
is
completely
irrelevant
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
but
the
only
issue
before
the
--
the
only
issue
at
the
administrative
hearing
was
whether
or
not
they
were
member
of
the
communist
party.
they
had
no
opportunity
and
the
statute
afforded
them
no
opportunity
to
show
that
they
were
people
of
the
category
i've
just
described,
and
indeed
their
affidavits
in
the
three-judge
court
which
are
un-contradicted
and
must
be
accepted
here
as
fact
state
that
their
purpose
in
travelling
was
not
only
perfectly
legitimate,
but
as
mr.
forer
will
point
out,
it
was
for
protective
purposes,
that's
the
same
purposes
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
that's
--
so
that
we're
not
talking
about
hypothetical
people,
we're
talking
about
the
two
appellants
who
are
here.
mr.
john
j.
abt
as
to
any
illegitimate
purposes
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
think
it
may
well
cover
these
appellants.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
under
the
statute
--
i
don't
know
what
the
secretary
or
the
hearing
officer
might
said,
well
go
ahead
and
offer
it,
you
may
offer
this
evidence.
but
under
the
statute
none
of
that
evidence
was
available
for
consideration
by
the
secretary.
the
secretary
had
found
that
these
were
very,
very
nice
people
who
had
never
committed
an
unlawful
act
in
their
lives,
had
no
knowledge
of
any
unlawful
activity
by
the
communist
party,
and
intended
to
go
abroad
for
the
best
of
purposes,
and
--
but
yet
found
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
and
he'd
issue
the
passport
to
them,
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
can
face
five
years
in
jail
for
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
the
question
is
who
has
the
burden?
who
under
a
constitutional
statute
would
have
the
burden?
and
beyond
that
is
the
question
that
the
act
is
written
makes
such
evidence
completely
irrelevant.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
that
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
kind
of
membership
was
a
different
question,
that
was
a
meaningful
membership
in
rowoldt
was
not
a
question
of
membership
with
knowledge
of
the
character,
with
the
alleged
illicit
character,
of
the
organization.
it
was
something
more
than
the
bare
fact
of
having
joined
the
organization,
that
was
all
was
an
issue
there.
now
we're
not
--
we
don't
for
moment
say
this
is
a
rowoldt
case.
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
i
did
make
in
a
record
in
the
district
court.
but
let
me
say
to
clarify
the
matter,
we're
not
from
--
and
if
that
was
what
you
meant
by
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
then
i
misunderstood
it,
misinterpreted
it.
we're
not
for
a
moment
calming
that
this
is
a
rowoldt
case.
but
we
are
saying
that
the
statute
is
invalid
because
it
doesn't
require
anything,
any
showing
by
the
secretary
except
the
bare
fact
of
membership.
and
in
this
respect
the
section
differs
very
radically
from
security
measures
like,
for
example,
the
federal
employees
security
program,
which
makes
membership
at
an
organization
that
has
been
officially
found
to
be
or
listed
as
subversive,
simply
one
piece
of
evidence
to
be
considered
in
determining
a
person's
--
or
evaluating
a
person's
loyalty.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
sir
i
would
not.
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
statue
would
be
a
valid
statute
and
that's
going
to
be
the
burden
of
my
part
of
the
argument.
if
it
said
that
--
or
let
me
restate
that,
i'm
making
too
much
of
a
concession.
i
would
say
that
my
--
the
point
i'm
now
making
would
wash
out,
if
the
statute
said,
that
the
fact
a
person
was
a
functionary
or
a
garden
verity
of
member
is
one
fact
that
the
secretary
of
state
should
take
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
his
travel
abroad
was
inimical
to
the
national
security.
then
the
statue
would
be
equated
with
the
ordinary
loyalty
or
security
of
programs
such
as
the
employees
security
program.
and
the
department
of
justice
itself
in
1950
when
the
act
was
under
consideration
in
congress,
pointed
out
the
vital
distinction
between
those
two
approaches,
that
is
to
say
the
approach
that
makes
members
--
the
bare
fact
of
membership
conclusive
evidence
of
disloyalty,
and
which
--
and
the
approach
which
makes
that
fact
of
membership
simply
one
factor
to
be
considered.
the
department
in
this
--
in
the
letter
that
it
sent
to
the
house
committee
that
was
considering
the
legislation
that
eventuated
in
the
act,
opposed
a
provision
that's
now
incorporated
in
section
5
of
the
act,
which
parallels
the
passport
provision
in
terms
of
defense
and
federal
employment.
the
letters
is
quoted
in
our
--
page
23
of
our
brief.
that
provision
made
it
unlawful
or
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
hold
federal
employment
or
employment
at
any
defense
facility.
and
the
department
in
its
letter
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
a
statute
of
that
kind
and
one
which,
in
the
words
of
the
letter
from
the
department
to
the
house
committee,
and
i
quote
it,
“enables
a
member
to
respond
to
charges
against
him.
and
to
show
in
a
manner
consistent
with
american
concepts
of
justice
and
fairness
that
his
membership
is
innocent
and
does
not
reflect
upon
his
loyalty”,
and
that
would
go
for
a
functionary
as
well
as
for
an
ordinary
member
mr.
justice
goldberg.
three
decisions
of
the
court
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
act
confirmed
the
view
that
the
department
expressed
in
this
letter
and
established
that
individual
guilt
or
disqualification
may
not
be
conclusively
presumed
from
the
bare
of
fact
of
membership
in
the
communist
party.
first
case
to
which
i
refer
is
the
scales
case,
which
the
court
upheld
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act,
but
only
by
construing
it
to
require
not
only
membership
in
an
organization
that
insights
the
violence,
but
knowledge
by
the
accused
of
the
--
the
fact
of
the
insightments,
active
membership
by
the
accused,
and
a
personal
intent
on
the
part
of
the
accused
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
now
scales
of
course
was
a
criminal
case,
but
the
court
has
applied
the
same
principle
in
at
least
two
cases
of
statutes
which
impose
civil
disabilities.
the
first
was
adler
versus
the
board
of
education,
which
involved
a
new
york
statute
that
made
knowing
membership
in
an
organization
found
by
the
new
york
board
of
regents
to
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
prima
facie
evidence
of
disqualification
to
teach
in
the
public
schools.
again,
the
court
sustained
the
statute,
but
only
because
it
required
two
things.
first
proof,
not
only
is
the
organization
had
been
listed
by
the
board
of
regents,
but
that
the
teacher
knew
the
character
of
the
organization.
and
second,
because
it
required
or
accorded
rather,
the
teacher
a
hearing,
at
which
he
could
offer
evidence
to
overcome
the
prima
facie
presumption
of
disqualification
that
flowed
from
his
membership
with
knowledge
of
the
character
of
the
organization.
and
in
wieman
versus
updegraff,
the
oklahoma
--
the
court
stuck
down
an
oklahoma
statute
which
lacked
these
protective
provisions.
a
statute
which
made
the
bare
fact
of
membership
present
or
past
disqualifying
and
the
court
there
stated
that
--
such
a
statute
violated
due
process
because
of
its
indiscriminate
classifications
of
knowing
and
with
innocent
activity,
and
section
6
we
submit
is
invalid
for
same
reason.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
both
the
executive
and
congress
have
recognized
that
this
kind
of
indiscriminate
classification
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
communist
party
as
security
risks
isn't
required
for
any
legitimate
security
purpose.
i've
already
mentioned
the
letter
from
the
department
of
justice
which
took
this
position
and
the
state
department
itself
seems
to
have
held
the
same
view
with
reference
to
passports.
because
as
the
government's
brief
reviles,
the
department
in
1948
adopted
the
practice
of
issuing
or
denying
of
passports
to
people
that
were
found
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party
on
an
individual
basis,
depending
on
its
appraisal
of
the
qualification
of
the
particular
applicant.
then
after
the
passage
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
in
1950,
the
department
inaugurated
the
practice
of
denying
passports
to
all
suspected
communists
indiscriminately.
but
this
change
was
not
occasioned
by
any
observed
inadequacy
of
the
previous
practice
for
security
purposes,
it
was
adopted
and
this
is
clear
from
the
record
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
in
deference
to
what
was
thought
to
be
the
policy
of
congress
is
expressed
in
section
6.
then
in
1958
when
the
kent
decision
came
down
and
invalidated
the
practice,
which
the
state
department
had
adopted,
the
administration
had
bills
introduced
in
congress
to
give
the
secretary
the
authority,
which
kent
held
that
he
lacked.
the
administration
bill
however
didn't
make
membership
in
the
communist
party
alone
disqualify,
didn't
establish
this
kind
of
conclusive
presumption
of
disqualification.
instead
that
bill
followed
the
pattern
of
the
federal
employee
security
program,
as
well
as
the
1948
practice
of
the
department
of
state
itself.
and
by
making
such
membership,
that
is
to
say
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
other
prescribed
organizations,
only
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
issuances
of
a
passport
would
be
inimical
to
the
national
security.
number
of
other
bills
introduced
in
congress
after
the
kent
decision
took
the
same
approach
and
two
of
the
bills,
which
embodied
this
approach
and
one
of
which
specifically
said
that
no
person
should
be
denied
a
passport
merely
because
of
the
fact
of
his
membership
in
any
organization,
two
of
such
bills
were
passed
in
the
house
in
the
85th
and
86th
congresses,
the
senate
never
acted
on
the
legislation.
matter
of
fact
even
in
1957
report
of
the
commission
on
government
security,
which
antedated
the
decision
in
kent
and
on
which
the
government
relies
very
heavily
in
its
brief
as
evidence
of
the
necessity
of
a
legislation
even
this
report
--
along
the
lines
of
the
question
that
you
asked
mr.
justice
harlan,
even
this
report
found
that
the
inflexibility
of
section
6
is,
may
well
be
and
is
a
prejudicial
to
the
national
interest.
and
accordingly
this
report,
which
again
i
emphasize
antedated
kent,
recommended
an
amendment
to
section
6
that
would
give
the
secretary
discretionary
authority
to
issue
passports
to
communists.
now
it
seems
to
me
plain
from
this
history
that
neither
the
executive
nor
congress
believed
that
the
conclusive
presumption
of
section
6,
that
is
the
conclusive
presumption
of
disqualification
which
it
establishes,
isn't
even
necessary
or
desirable
as
a
matter
of
policy.
and
we
think
that
the
enactment
of
section
6
doesn't
indicate
any
considerate
congressional
judgment
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
let
me
explain
to
you
why
i
think
it's
on
the
books
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
on
the
books
first
of
all
because
it
was
a
product
of
what
now
appear
i
think
to
most
of
us
who
have
been
--
the
exaggerated
fears
of
our
national
security
that
were
engendered
by
the
outbreak
of
the
korean
war.
and
second
it's
likewise
a
product
and
the
legislative
history
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
shows
that
of
the
prevailing
misapprehension
prior
to
the
decision
in
kent
that
the
issuance
or
denial
of
a
passport
was
a
matter
of
grace
with
the
government,
something
that
the
government
could
withhold,
give
or
withhold
with
pleasure
uninhibited
by
any
constitutional
limitations,
and
i
think
that
those
two
considerations
are
what
account
for
section
6.
mr.
john
j.
abt
kent
says
not.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
is
nothing
since
--
no
legislation
since
that
time
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
if
you
want
to
get
around
--
that
if
the
congress
wanted
to
get
around
the
point
that
i
am
now
making,
all
it
has
to
do
is
to
enact
the
bill
that
the
secretary
of
state
send
up
to
the
hill
after
the
kent
decision,
which
made
membership
in
the
communist
party
simple
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
a
total
evaluation
of
the
applicant
as
a
security
risk.
and
our
brief
--
if
you
want
the
language
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it's
in
our
brief
and
we
quote
the
bills
that
were
pending
in
the
congress.
the
government's
defense
of
section
6
comes
down
to
the
proposition
that
it's
a
reasonable
measure
for
the
prevention
of
espionage.
but
i
submit
that
on
the
face
of
the
matter,
it's
absurd
to
suppose
that
known
members
of
the
communist
party,
let
alone
party
leaders
against
whom
the
government
says
that
the
act
was
particularly
directed
would
be
selected
for
some
foreign
espionage
in
its
submission.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
gives
the
slightest
credence
to
any
such
supposition
either
in
the
very
lengthy
record
before
the
board,
the
subversive
activities
control
board
in
the
registration
proceeding
or
anywhere
else.
furthermore
no
genuine
anti-espionage
law
would
prevent
suspects
from
travelling
to
monte
carlo
or
to
rome
by
permitting
them
to
make
trips
to
mexico
city
or
rio,
nor
can
the
prevention
of
face-to-face
contact
in
europe
be
seriously
defended
as
a
security
measure
while
all
other
means
of
communication
are
left
wide
open.
mr.
john
j.
abt
you
are
getting
into
a
--
or
you
maybe
approaching
a
different
another
area
mr.
justice
harlan,
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
might
be
considerations
of
foreign
relations,
which
would
--
which
might
justify
that
kind
of
a
regulation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
the
only
justification
that
congress
gave,
that's
the
only
justification
that
the
government
advances,
and
that's
the
only
justification
i
can
conceive
of.
nobody
suggested
that
this
legislation
can
be
supported
on
any
concept
of
necessity
for
not
embarrassing
our
foreign
relations
in
some
fashion.
finally,
section
6
would
violate
due
process
even
i
submit
if
it
were
reasonable
to
classify
all
members
of
the
communist
party
a
security
risks
ipso
facto.
this
is
so
because
the
right
to
travel
is
a
part
of
a
liberty
of
every
citizen
and
a
person
may
not
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
merely
upon
the
suspicion,
no
matter
how
well
founded
that
suspicion
may
be,
that
he
will
abuse
it.
the
practice
of
preventive
detention,
and
that's
what
section
6
is,
has
no
place
i
submit
in
our
constitutional
system.
with
us,
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
so
fundamental
that
even
persons
convicted
of
crime
may
not
be
deprived
of
their
liberty
pending
appeal
as
a
means
of
preventing
them
from
committing
other
crimes,
but
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
secure
their
presence
and
their
submission
to
the
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
am
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
am
saying
that
we
should
–
we
got
to
proceed
in
security
matters
mr.
justice
goldberg
just
as
we
proceed
elsewhere.
we
can
charge
a
man
with
the
fact
--
with
crime
after
he
--
the
crime
that
has
been
committed,
you
can
try
him,
you
can
put
him
in
jail,
punish
him.
but
you
can't
punish
a
man
because
you
suspect
that
if
you
don't
punish
him
he
is
going
to
commit
a
crime.
that's
--
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
me
is
a
throwback
to
the
writs
of
ne
exeat
regnum
that
the
british
crown
used
to
suppress
defenders
by
confining
--
sent
by
confining
the
defenders.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
and
i
would
argue
that
that
bill
is
not
invalid
--
is
invalid
because
it's
a
form
of
preventive
detention.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
i
am
not
saying
it
is
a
punishment,
but
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it's
a
deprivation
of
liberty
based
not
upon
a
past
act
which
--
on
past
conduct,
but
a
deprivation
of
liberty
based
on
a
suspicion
of
future
misconduct,
and
as
i
say
to
me
that
is
preventive
detention.
that's
what
the
british
used,
the
british
kings
used
when
they
issued
writs
of
ne
exeat
regnum,
and
it's
particularly
obnoxious
where
the
descent
or
the
where
the
suspected
activity
is
activity
of
a
political
nature.
let
me
point
out
only
in
conclusion,
concluding
my
portion
of
the
argument,
that
no
other
western
democracy
confines
its
communists
within
its
borders,
and
if
to
do
so
would
be
a
suicide
pact
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
france,
england,
italy
all
of
them
have
much
larger
and
more
powerful
communists
parties
than
we
have
--
have
entered
into
the
suicide
pacts.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes
your
honor
and
i
say
that
under
the
constitution
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
deprive
a
man
of
liberty
because
it
thinks
that
if
he
is
given
his
liberty
he
may
abuse
it.
he's
got
to
abuse
it
first
and
then
you
can
punish
him
for
the
abuse
but
you
can't
deprive
him
of
liberty
in
anticipation
of
an
abuse.
and
i
want
to
submit
that
the,
that
the
government's
fervor
in
defending
what
to
me
is
the
–
an
odious
practice
of
preventive
detention
is
a
symptom
of
what
senator
fulbright
recently
called
and
i
quote
him,
“a
morbid
preoccupation
with
the
dangers
of
communist
subversion
and
a
flexion
for
which
we
americans
continue
to
pay
so
dearly
in
terms
of
our
personal
liberty
and
equally
in
terms
of
our
national
dignity.”
mr.
forer
will
continue.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
finding
of
the
hearing
officer
in
the
case
of
dr.
aptheker,
which
appears
as
a
part
of
the
letter
from
mrs.
knight
to
him
at
page
13
of
the
record.
it
states
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
record,
the
state
department
had
reason
to
believe
that
you
were
within
the
purview
of
section
6
(a)
of
the
act.
that's
the
only
finding
that
the
hearing
officer
made
in
that
case.
it
didn't
even
make
a
finding
of
membership,
only
a
finding
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
dr.
aptheker
was
a
member.
second
i
would
like
–
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
board.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
this
was
the
finding
of
the
hearing
officer.
hearing
officer
found
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
dr.
aptheker
was
a
member.
it
appears
at
page
13
of
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
abt
of
course
it's
not
an
issue.
it's
not
an
issue
except
to
the
extent
that
it's
been
talking
about
mere
membership,
whatever
mere
membership
is,
and
by
mere
membership
i
assume
we've
been
talking
about
non-meaningful
membership
in
the
rowoldt
sense,
a
coerced
membership
or
a
casual
membership
something
on
this
kind,
that's
not
in
this
case.
but
i
do
want
to
reply
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
as
to
whether
the
state
department
has
applied
passport
provision
to
rank
and
file
members.
let's
used
at
term
instead
of
mere
member
of
the
organization.
and
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
statute
makes
it
difficult
but
not
impossible
for
a
rank
and
file
member
to
apply
for
a
passport,
because
by
the
very
act
of
applying,
he's
subjecting
himself
to
a
possible
five-year
prison
sentence,
and
this
no
academic
business.
the
department
of
justice
last
fall
indicted
a
women,
i
don't
know
whether
she
is
a
mere
member
or
rank
and
file
member,
or
what
kind
of
member
she
is,
but
indicted
her
out
of
down
in
san
francisco
charged
with
just
doing
one
thing
for
having
applied
for
a
passport
while
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
i
should
think
would
be
sufficient
to
discourage
rank
and
file
members
from
testing
out
the
application
of
the
act
to
themselves.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
no,
no,
the
section
6
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
member
of
the
party
to
apply.
she
applied,
and
the
government
alleges
that
she
is
a
member.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
quite
right,
because
mr.
justice
frankfurter
we
may
not
be,
may
never
be
confronted
with
that
problem
because
communist
may
never
want
a
trial.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right,
that's
correct.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
who
said
that
that's
a
unique
kind
of
situation
which
requires
a
citizen
to
subject
himself
to
a
possible
five-year
penalty
in
order
to
find
out
whether
a
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
says
what
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
that's
not
--
that's
not
directly
before
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
and
i
raised,
i
made
the
remark
i
did
and
reply
to
a
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
to
mr.
chayes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
happen,
there
happened
to
be
a
revocation
proceeding
otherwise
we
would
have
to
try
out
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
state
department
did
us
a
favor
i
would
say,
or
did
the
organization
a
favor
in
permitting
this
case
to
brought
in
a
civil
from
rather
than
requiring
a
criminal
prosecution
to
try
it
out.
now,
as
i
understand
mr.
chayes,
what
he,
in
bottom,
is
saying
is
that
it's
necessary
to
deny
passports
to
all
members
of
the
communist
party
as
a
class
indiscriminately,
because
we
have
to
forestall
the
possibility
of
their
doing
something
illegal
if
they
went
abroad.
now,
and
it's
too
risky
to
wait
until
they
do
something
illegal
and
then
prosecute
them.
i'd
like
to
say
only
that
all
democracy
i
think
mr.
justice
holmes
who
made
the
point
long
ago
i
can't
remember
the
exact
phrase,
but
all
democracy
is
a
risk.
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
very
risky
business.
and
the
rule
against
the
prior
restraints
on
first
amendment
--
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
is
a
very
risky
business.
you
got
to
wait
until
something
bad
is
done
under
our
constitution
before
you
can
prosecute
a
man
or
punishing
or
deny
--
or
deprive
him
of
his
liberty.
now
--
but
even
if
we
put
that
one
aside,
put
aside
the
argument
i
made
earlier
on
the
question
of
preventive
detention,
which
i
think
is
very
much
in
the
foreground
of
this
case,
and
talk
only
about
the
form
of
this
statute.
mr.
chayes
is
a
legal
advisor
for
the
state
department
but
i
must
say
that
he
talks,
when
he
argues
to
this
court,
as
a
typical
prosecutor.
the
typical
prosecutor
says,
if
we
have
to
prove
that
this
man
from
the
beginning
of
ab
initio,
this
man
committed
a
crime,
will
never
get
a
conviction,
and
therefore
we
need
a
presumption
that
was
tot
case
that
mr.
justice
black
--
in
which
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion
and
that's
been
the
cry
the
of
prosecutor
since
the
beginning
of
time,
we
need
the
help
of
a
presumption.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
national
security
is
so
endangered
that
we've
got
to
throw
away
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
rely
on
these
kind
of
presumptions
that
every
person
who
joined
the
communist
party,
merely
because
of
his
membership,
is
a
potential
spy,
saboteur,
or
whatnot
in
order
to
protect
the
national
security
of
this
country.
indeed
i
think
in
terms
of
the
real
source
and
base
of
our
national
security,
it
lies
not
in
shortcut
procedures
of
this
kind
but
the
real
base
of
our
national
security
that
lies
in
the
perseverance
of
our
constitution
and
the
democratic
processors
that
have
been
traditional
with
us
and
i
that
i
hope
that
we'll
continue
to
observe.
thank
you.
