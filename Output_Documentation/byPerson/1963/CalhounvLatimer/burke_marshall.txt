mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
fourth
case
that
this
court
has
reviewed
involving
school
desegregation
since
its
opinion
in
the
brown
cases
in
1954
and
1955.
that
includes
the
prince
edward
case
which
was
argued
yesterday.
the
united
states
has
participated
in
each
of
these
cases
as
amicus,
not
only
because
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
millions
of
its
citizens,
but
also
because
of
its
interest
on
the
effect
on
the
education
of
millions
of
children
in
at
least
11
of
our
states
from
the
manner
and
speed
with
which
the
brown
decisions
are
implemented.
this
is
the
--
the
first
of
the
four
cases
that
presents
the
court
directly
with
an
opportunity
to
review
the
application
by
school
boards
and
the
lower
courts
of
the
deliberate
speed
concept.
the
standards
of
that
concept
are
contained
in
a
very
few
sentences
in
the
brown
case,
cooper
against
aaron,
goss
and
watson.
the
issue
is
whether
those
standards
were
applied
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
atlanta
school
board.
i
think
that
it
is
relevant
in
considering
that
question
to
look
at
the
implementation
of
the
brown
decisions
elsewhere
as
well.
first
in
terms
of
the
general
statistics
in
the
11
states
and
secondly,
with
the
respect
to
the
facts
showing
experience
in
particular,
other
cities.
the
general
statistics
do
not
show
widespread
compliance
as
yet
with
the
brown
decision.
in
the
11
states
of
texas,
louisiana,
alabama,
mississippi,
georgia,
florida,
arkansas,
tennessee,
north
carolina,
south
carolina,
and
virginia,
82%
of
the
school
districts
are
still
segregated.
there
are
30,000
as
of
this
last
fall,
negro
children
going
to
school
with
white
children
in
these
states.
that's
out
of
a
total
of
three
and
a
half
million
white
children
and
about
a
million
negro
children,
who
are
technically
going
to
the
schools
in
desegregated
districts
that
is
districts
where
some
negro
children
are
going
with
white
children.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
don't
have
--
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
it
would,
mr.
justice
stewart,
much
larger.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes.
the
number
of
--
of
white
children
going
to
schools
which
have
some
negro
children
in
them
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
would
be
much
larger,
yes.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
figure
on
the
number
of
white
children
going
in
--
to
school
in
school
districts
where
there
are
some
negro
children
and
some
white
schools
is
three
and
a
half
million.
but
how
many
of
those
are
going
to
schools
in
which
there
are
negro
children
also
attending
on
is
not
the
statistics
i
have.
in
those
same
districts,
there
are
a
million
negro
children.
this
is
out
of
a
total
school
population
in
this
area
of
about
almost
3
million
negro
children
and
almost
8
million
white
children.
the
percentage
of
negro
children
going
to
school
with
white
children
is
a
little
over
1%.
in
part,
these
statistics
simply
show
no
movement
at
all.
but
in
part
and
i
think
this
is
true
as
to
the
30,000
children
that
are
going
to
schools
with
white
children,
30,000
negro
children
were
actually
going
to
schools
with
white
children
in
desegregated
school
districts
which
contained
a
total
of
over
a
million
negro
children,
that
they
show
so
many
facts
of
the
application
by
the
school
boards
and
the
district
courts
of
the
deliberate
speed
concept.
that
the
experience
in
some
cities
has
been
that
large
school
districts
can
desegregate
rapidly
and
that
delay
is
not
necessary
or
even
helpful
once
the
start
is
made
at
least
as
an
administrative
matter.
now
one
example
of
that
is
here
in
washington
which
was
desegregated
all
at
once
in
1954
by
complete
rezoning
of
a
dual
school
system.
that
was
done
of
course
in
the
city
with
a
large
negro
population
and
it
was
done
just
a
year
after
the
restaurants
in
the
cities
were
desegregated
following
this
court's
decision
in
thompson.
in
baltimore,
it
was
done
in
all
one
year
in
1954
that
all
pupils
in
the
entering
school
in
the
first
year
of
elementary
school
or
the
first
--
or
the
first
year
of
secondary
school,
being
admitted
to
the
schools
of
their
choice
and
all
other
children
that
were
already
in
the
school
system
being
permitted
to
transfer.
the
baltimore
board
considered
and
rejected
gradual
desegregation
approaches.
in
louisville,
kentucky,
another
large
city
was
desegregation
was
achieved
in
one
year
in
1956,
all
levels
of
education
in
the
city
were
redistricted
and
transfers
were
permitted
thereafter
on
the
grounds
of
space,
convenience,
and
individual
preferences.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
this
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
this,
mr.
justice
stewart.
these
are
large
cities.
they
did
have
completely
segregated
school
districts
when
they
started,
when
they
first
look
at
the
system.
the
one
thing
that
the
brown
decision
in
cooper
against
aaron
--
cooper
against
aaron
in
all
decisions
in
--
in
this
field
have
ruled
out
as
a
factor
of
delay
is
disagreement
with
the
brown
decision.
and
so
the
emphasis
is
on
administrative
problems,
administrative
problems
in
rezoning,
transportation,
the
assignment
of
personnel
and
that
kind
of
thing.
those
were
the
factors
that
brown
specified.
it
--
it
seemed
to
me,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
experience
in
these
large
cities
has
some
bearing,
some
relevancy
at
least
on
--
on
the
question
of
whether
administrative
problems
of
that
sort
require
a
plan
which
takes
until
as
senator
motley
pointed
out
1977
fall
to
implement
completely.
the
--
the
manner
in
which
this
was
achieved
in
st.
louis
was
in
three
steps.
in
september
1954,
february
1955
and
september
1955,
involving
in
a
step-by-step
plan,
the
junior
college
and
teacher
college,
the
first
time
and
high
schools
accept
the
technical
ones
the
second
time
and
the
technical
high
schools
and
the
elementary
schools
in
the
third
stage
and
this
again,
involved
complete
rezoning
and
the
creation
of
new
mandatory
attendance
districts
with
transfers
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
overcrowding.
there's
also
been
progress
in
the
cities
where
there
have
been
severe
problems
to
start
with.
new
orleans,
they're
at
now
350
negro
children
attending
27
schools,
norfolk,
347
in
12
schools,
where
the
schools
were
closed
at
first.
little
rock,
the
school
board
announced
a
complete
desegregation
this
fall.
nashville,
the
first
seven
grades
have
been
desegregated
with
773
negro
children
now
in
white
schools.
as
i've
said,
the
relevance
of
these
statistics
seems
to
me
to
show
that
urban
desegregation
as
an
administrative
problem
which
is
what
brown
talked
about
can
be
accomplished
rapidly.
and
of
course,
the
watson
and
the
goss
case
suggest
in
any
event
that
the
passage
of
time
since
the
brown
decisions
in
--
in
itself
has
altered
the
situation
because
the
constitutional
doctrines
are
--
are
in
effect,
are
no
longer
novel,
they
shouldn't
be
expected.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
--
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
to
it.
some
of
these
statistics
that
i
have
referred
to
show
just
no
movement,
it's
as
if
we
had
to
sue
every
taxpayer
to
make
him
pay
his
taxes
or
no
corporation
obeyed
the
sherman
act
until
you
brought
a
suit
against
them.
that
isn't
the
problem
in
this
case
however,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
this
case,
atlanta
is
under
a
court
order
and
it's
a
question
of
what
the
court
order
should
be
in
a
city
which
is
already
started,
which
has
shown
a
willingness
in
fact
a
determination
at
first
against
the
good
deal
of
opposition
to
obey
the
court
orders.
and
that,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
plan
that
in
atlanta
is
leading
with
deliberate
speed
to
what
is
required
by
brown
which
is
an
admission
of
all
pupils
into
a
racially
non-segregated
system.
so
i
--
i
think
the
other
problem,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
a
--
in
a
sense
can't
be
dealt
with
by
this
court,
has
to
be
dealt
with
in
some
other
fashion
or
its
legislation
now
before
congress
which
--
which
would
--
would
reach
it
to
some
extent,
but
it
isn't
--
it
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
what
an
order
--
this
order
against
atlanta
should
say
if
there's
no
movement
at
all
in
a
school
district
that
is
not
a
problem
that
this
court
can
deal
with
and
the
order
it
corrects
against
the
atlanta
schools
district.
in
our
opinion,
the
atlanta
plan
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
brown
decision
after
this
experience
in
atlanta
and
this
experience
in
the
contract
in
three
respects.
and
that
it's
convenient
for
me
talking
about
this
to
separate
the
problem
in
the
high
schools
from
the
problem
in
the
elementary
schools
system.
as
justice
stewart
mentioned,
there
is
no
junior
high
school
system
so
that
the
high
schools
in
atlanta
start
with
the
8th
grade.
so
first
as
to
the
high
school
system,
it
is
our
view
that
the
plan
does
not
conform
to
the
constitutional
requirement
in
the
high
schools
starting
this
fall
despite
the
fact
that
some
negro
children
will
be
going
to
school
with
white
in
all
grades
starting
this
fall
including
the
8th
grade.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
in
the
9th,
10th,
11th,
and
12th
grades
this
fall,
the
initial
assignment
will
still
be
on
a
racial
basis
being
a
continuation
of
the
assignment
from
this
year
and
only
the
8th
grade
will
be
desegregated
and
what
we
view
as
a
constitutional
manner
with
the
initial
race
--
initial
assignment
being
totally
without
regard
to
race.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
i
think
that
in
all
urban
areas,
the
problem
overcrowded
schools
is
such
that
you
couldn't
--
couldn't
device
a
plan
for
school
system
which
didn't
take
that
into
account,
so
you
couldn't
just
assign
people
to
the
school
that
they
live
nearest
to.
but
i
--
i
think
that
the
school
system
in
atlanta,
the
high
school
system
in
atlanta
is
going
to
have
to
be
reorganized,
rezoned.
some
sort
of
attendance
be
--
have
to
be
set
up
for
the
8th
grade
anyway
as
the
school
board
itself
concedes
in
its
brief.
so
i
--
i
think
it
was
unclear
before
that,
but
i
think
it's
now
clear
in
the
brief
of
the
school
board
and
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
--
i
--
i
would
accept
that,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
know
but
i
would
accept
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
white,
it
depends
on
why
they're
there.
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
accept
for
the
8th
grade
next
fall
is
complying
with
the
constitution.
what
the
school
board
in
the
state
of
georgia
says
is
going
to
be
done.
they
say
that
the
assignments
to
the
8th
grade
will
be
without
regard
to
race,
that
the
feeder
system
which
has
been
the
basis
of
assignment
up
until
this
fall
will
be
discontinued
and
that
there
will
be
a
new
zoning
or
new
attendances
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
white,
if
it
--
i
would
say
that's
up
to
the
school
board.
if
--
if
they
take
--
if
they
just
grew
circles
around
each
school
and
took
every
child
that
lived
in
the
circle
and
sent
him
to
a
school
then
i
would
say
that
the
schools
in
the
negro
neighborhoods
are
going
to
end
up
being
overcrowded.
but
the
constitution
doesn't
require
them
to
do
that.
all
the
school
districts
take
into
account
the
residential
area
and
the
number
of
people
that
lives
in
--
live
in
it
in
a
population.
they
--
they
deal
with
that
either
by
changing
the
school
district
or
permitting
a
free
transfer
plan
or
some
other
fashion.
a
school
board
in
atlanta
has
shown
itself
able
to
deal
with
these
problems.
i'm
sure
it
can.
the
second
way
in
which
we
believe
that
the
atlanta
plan
is
unacceptable
under
the
requirements
of
the
brown
decision
now,
is
in
the
weight
of
desegregation
in
the
elementary
schools.
we
think
that
the
district
court
erred
when
he
refused
to
reexamine
the
speed
of
--
desegregation
that's
envisaged
by
the
plan
and
that
he
erred
in
fair
--
failing
to
require
the
school
board
to
prove
what
administrative
problems
if
any,
prevented
a
--
an
acceleration
of
desegregation
in
the
elementary
schools
either
to
the
extent
that
was
requested
by
the
plaintiffs
which
is
to
cut
it
down
to
two
years
or
even
to
do
it
all
at
once.
the
third
mistake
that
we
believe
the
courts
below
made,
was
in
refusing
to
order
the
school
board
to
adopt
any
plan
at
all
with
respect
to
the
integration
of
faculty
and
particularly
as
to
that
point
i
think
with
that
--
with
respect
to
the
integration
of
the
faculty
in
the
high
schools
which
will
otherwise
be
completely
desegregated
in
the
8th
grade
and
we
believe
also
in
--
it
should
be
required
in
the
remaining
grades
this
fall.
as
to
the
pupil
assignment
in
the
high
schools,
there's
no
dispute
but
that
that
is
the
desegregation
that
has
taken
place
in
the
high
schools,
has
been
by
a
transferred
system.
the
initial
assignment
of
pupils
under
the
high
schools
has
been
by
a
feeder
system.
and
under
that
system,
since
the
lower
grades
are
completely
segregated
still,
all
negro
students
automatically
came
out
of
the
7th
grade,
went
into
the
8th
grade
into
five
negro
high
schools
except
to
these
negro
high
schools
by
everyone.
mr.
burke
marshall
there
is
a
--
atlanta,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
the
first
elementary
school
district
in
georgia
to
desegregate.
at
the
time
they
did
that
as
i
mentioned
briefly
before,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
opposition,
political
opposition
to
it
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
school
board
of
atlanta
and
the
people
of
atlanta
faced
that
problem
in
--
in
the
very
fine
fashion
determined
to
resist
school
opposing
which
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
threatened.
that
was
in
1960.
in
1961,
they
desegregated
in
accordance
with
the
court's
orders
and
did
it
in
as
far
as
the
court's
orders
are
concerned,
in
a
fine
fashion.
the
--
since
then,
there
has
been
--
there
was
prior
to
the
atlanta
desegregation,
there
were
negro
students
admitted
in
the
university
of
georgia.
and
since
then,
there
has
been
some
desegregation
in
savannah
and
there
is
an
order
in
effect
for
next
fall
in
albany,
georgia.
there
is
some
desegregation,
i
believe
scheduled
for
next
fall
in
columbus,
georgia.
and
that's
all
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
burke
marshall
and
savannah.
mr.
burke
marshall
and
atlanta.
mr.
burke
marshall
senator
motley
informs
me,
there's
some
in
brunswick,
georgia
also
that
there
are
six
negro
students
assigned
to
white
schools
in
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
--
that
is
one
that
--
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
has
--
has
been
in
existence
since
the
second
brown
case
in
all
the
circuits.
now
it's
been
litigated
in
all
the
circuits.
now
--
but
as
--
as
the
deliberate
speed
concept
started
to
be
applied,
the
--
there
is
a
tendency
on
part
of
the
school
board,
i
think
this
was
true
of
the
atlanta
school
board
and
on
them,
the
court
of
the
district
courts
to
think
about
the
problem
as
if
it
could
be
solved
by
taking
individual
negroes
that
applied
in
putting
them
through
some
series
of
tests
and
then
assigned
them
to
particular
white
schools.
that's
why
we
have
30,000
out
of
more
than
a
million
negro
children
in
desegregated
districts
that
are
going
to
white
high
--
white
schools.
the
brown
case,
both
brown
cases
in
cooper
against
aaron
talked
about
a
constitutional
requirement
for
non-segregated
school
systems.
and
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
most
school
boards
and
until
recently,
most
district
courts
have
not
been
looking
at
it
in
those
terms.
now
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
there's
been
litigation
in
all
four
circuits
that
were
mainly
concerned
with
this,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
the
8th
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
--
all
of
those
circuits
have
held
and
had
come
up
and
they
have
held
that
the
elimination
of
dual
school
systems
of
this
overlapping
assignment
plans
that
you
referred
to
earlier
are
--
is
unnecessary
part
of
compliance
with
brown.
but
that
has
not
been
clear
and
i
think
it
--
i
think
a
premise
of
the
atlanta
plan
as
it
started
at
least,
was
that
the
law
required
no
more
than
a
transfer
plan.
but
as
i
understand
the
school
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'd
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
this
court
did
approve
that
in
the
shuttlesworth
case.
the
shuttlesworth
case
came
--
mr.
burke
marshall
sir?
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
it
--
the
issue
was
different.
the
issue
was
different.
the
shuttlesworth
case
came
up
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
that's
all
you
have.
that's
all
this
court
had
was
the
statute.
if
you
read
that
statute,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
transfers.
it
had
to
do
with
the
initial
assignments.
it
assumed
that
you
weren't
assigning
pupils
on
the
grounds
of
residence
alone
or
--
or
residence
plus
a
capacity
factor,
but
that
you
gave
them
tests
and
so
forth.
and
it
assumed
and
you
could
read
the
statute
on
a
suit
that
every
pupil,
when
he
first
entered
school,
was
going
to
go
through
these
series
of
tests
and
be
placed
in
the
school
not
because
of
race
but
because
of
how
we
faired
on
these
tests.
but
this
was
talking
about
initial
assignment,
not
that
it
weighed
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
it
wasn't
superimposed,
so
i
think
it
was
quite
different.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
courts
below
referred
to
this
as
the
atlanta
plan
as
having
been
based
on
shuttlesworth
and
--
and
some
of
the
factors
that
they
used
in
judging
transfers
were
but
--
but
the
--
the
shuttlesworth
case
did
not
--
did
not
approve
a
transfer
system.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
rate
of
desegregation
in
the
elementary
schools,
the
courts
below
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
plaintiffs
and
not
on
the
school
districts
and
held
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record
now
to
show
that
the
plan
was
not
reasonable
now
and
to
show
that
the
--
it
was
not
proceeding
at
deliberate
speed
and
they
put
a
good
deal
of
weight
also
as
--
and
their
weight
should
be
put
on
this,
on
the
good
faith
of
the
atlanta
school
board
and
on
their
cooperation
in
maintaining
law
and
order
and
on
the
increase
and
transfers
that
the
board
approved
that
after
the
first
year
and
going
on
to
the
second
and
third
year.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
what
didn't
--
what
was
not
eliminated
by
the
board
itself
i
think
has
been
eliminated
by
the
opinion
on
rehearing
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
burke
marshall
as
i
understand
it,
it's
just
residence,
where
did
they
live?
mr.
burke
marshall
i
--
as
i
understand
the
school
board
may
enlighten
on
this
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
they
reprint
in
their
brief,
a
letter
which
is
not
in
the
record
which
sets
forth
the
basis
on
which
they
judge
transfers.
and
as
i
understand
that
that's
it,
that
the
--
they
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
that's
as
i
understand
it.
we
think
that
the
burden
should've
been
put
on
the
school
board.
for
one
thing,
the
court's
opinions
in
goss
and
watson
indicate
that
that
is
so,
that
the
time
that
has
passed
since
brown,
the
experience
that
we've
had
since
brown,
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
doctrines
are
no
longer
new,
requires
a
reevaluation
of
--
of
speed
and
the
justifications
for
delay
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
in
addition,
we
think
that
the
experience
in
atlanta
itself
requires
a
reexamination
that
the
desegregation
that
has
been
taken
--
has
taken
place
is
taking
place
without
problems,
once
it
was
over
with,
it
was
over
with
and
it's
been
accepted
in
the
community
and
in
the
state,
the
board
itself
has
recognized
this
by
easing
requirements
to
some
extent
to
partly
under
compulsion,
partly
voluntarily
and
what
tests
they
gave
to
transfer
applications.
and
the
court
below
again
realized
that
to
some
degree
that
this
should
be
reevaluated.
but
they
did
not
reexamine
the
situation.
they
did
not
give
the
school
board
or
required
the
school
board
again
to
show
what
administrative
problems
of
any
justified
delay
which
is,
as
i
again
say,
ends
up
with
the
school
board,
the
school
systems
not
getting
clear
--
completely
in
compliance
with
the
constitution
until
fall
of
1977.
and
thirdly,
we
think
that
they
should
have
ordered,
just
reexamined
because
of
the
law
has
become
clear.
the
premise
of
the
plan
had
been
the
transfer
and
that
has
been
knocked
out.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
any
system
which
starts
with
initial
racial
assignment
and
depends
upon
transfers
out
of
schools
after
that
does
not
comport
with
the
brown
decision.
now
if
the
--
if
the
assignment,
if
it
works
as
it
works
in
baltimore
and
the
students
can
go
to
the
--
whatever
school
they
choose
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
i
think
that
any
system
which
retains
a
negro
school
district,
any
negro
school
district
as
such
to
which
pupils
are
assigned
because
they're
negroes,
not
because
of
where
they
live
or
something
else,
but
because
they're
negroes
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
burke
marshall
and
this
is
transitional,
of
course
and
--
mr.
burke
marshall
it's
necessarily
required?
no,
i
think
that
transfer
system,
mr.
justice
white
and
some
transfer
system
is
probably
administratively
required
in
any
school
system
because
of
the
problems
of
the
capacity,
because
of
the
problems
of
courses
being
offered
in
some
schools
in
--
mr.
burke
marshall
yes.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
indicate
that.
i
think
that
any
plan
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
misstated
my
position
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
because
i
think
that
any
--
any
plan
that
does
not
end
up
and
does
not
point
with
deliberate
speed
towards
the
elimination
of
the
dual
systems
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
but
as
a
transitional
--
mr.
burke
marshall
but
that's
my
--
that's
right,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice.
the
question
is
--
the
question
is,
does
it
end
up
in
the
right
place
and
does
it
get
there
with
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
deliberate
speed?
mr.
burke
marshall
now
if
it
maintains
--
if
it
maintains
the
dual
school
system
in
grades
that
are
being
desegregated
as
this
one
does,
i
think
it
carries
in
very,
very
heavy
burden
to
justify
that,
because
why
do
it?
it's
necessarily
a
delay
having
a
problem
with
the
atlanta
plan
i
suppose,
is
that
it
started
backwards.
mr.
burke
marshall
it
started
from
the
top
down.
if
you
started
the
plan
with
the
first
grade,
i
can't
think
there
maybe
one
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
but
i
can't
think
of
any
justification
for
continuing
the
dual
school
system
in
assignments
so
that
the
first
grade.
now
when
it
goes
backwards
and
i
--
and
i
myself
think
there's
some
question
whether
going
backwards
can
be
justified
but
if
it
goes
backwards
and
that's
over
with
in
this
case
and
started
that
way,
if
it
goes
backwards
there
maybe
administrative
reasons
during
a
transitional
period
where
--
where
that
could
be
justified.
but
as
to
the
high
school
in
atlanta
--
as
to
the
high
school,
i
don't
think
that
there
could
or
any
conceivable
administrative
reasons
anymore
because
they
have
to
reorganize
by
their
own
plan.
mr.
burke
marshall
they
have
to
reorganize
this
year
anyway
because
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
they've
reached
the
(inaudible)
mr.
burke
marshall
i'm
sorry.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
mr.
justice
white,
i
did
not
understand
your
question.
i
misunderstood
your
question
because
i
--
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
have
in
my
mind
the
transitional
aspect
of
it.
if
it
--
if
it
happens
for
one
year
and
the
plan
on
its
phase
contemplates
that
it's
going
to
end
that
year
and
the
year
after
that,
there's
going
to
be
a
--
an
elimination
of
the
initial
racial
assignment,
i
don't
say
that
that
is
necessary.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
the
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
bush
case
and
the
escambia
case
and
--
and
the
houston
case
which
were
cited
in
our
brief
except
i
think,
for
the
houston
case.
the
houston
case
is
at
312
f.2d
191.
i
think
that
they
suggest
that
--
that
it's
impermissible
even
as
a
transitional
manner.
however
those
cases
were
all
concerned
with
first
grade
up
and
--
and
this
case
goes
backwards
and
there
are
administrative
--
potential
administrative
problems
that
i
can
see
when
you
go
backwards.
now,
when
you
have
to
reorganize
the
high
school
zones
and
everything
just
for
the
12th
grade
that
don't
--
that
aren't
--
aren't
in
the
picture
at
all
when
you
start
with
the
first
grade
either
the
first
grade
of
elementary
school
or
the
first
grade
of
the
secondary
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
judge
bell
wrote
the
decision
before
it
points
out
what
i
just
pointed
out
that
in
the
first
place,
that
the
other
decisions
are
concerned
with
first
grade
plans
that's
to
go
upwards.
and
secondly
that
they
didn't
--
that
they
didn't
necessarily
concentrate
on
the
transitional
feature
as
such.
and
judge
bell
pointed
out
that
of
course
this
reached
his
high
school,
first
entering
grade
of
high
school
next
fall.
now,
the
court
below
did
say
that
even
though
that
happened,
it's
alright
to
continue
the
initial
racial
assignments
in
the
9th,
10th,
11th,
and
12th
grades
which
is
something
that
wouldn't
end
until
1968.
i
do
not
think
that
that
can
be
justified,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
think
that
our
position
is
this,
that
the
high
school
system
should
be
reorganized
so
that
the
initial
or
racial
assignments
are
eliminated
completely
this
fall.
now
that
is
going
to
be
done
as
the
school
board
says
as
to
the
8th
grade
anyway,
we
--
we
do
not
see
any
justification
and
maybe
there
is
one
but
i
haven't
seen
any
events
for
not
doing
that
as
to
the
entire
high
school
if
you're
going
to
do
it
as
the
first
grade
of
high
school
and
there's
already
some
desegregation
in
the
other
grades.
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
elementary
school,
we
think
that
the
court
below
should've
put
a
burden
on
the
--
on
the
school
board
to
justify
not
doing
--
not
accelerating,
now
maybe
they
can
justify
that,
they
--
they
haven't
and
so
i
would
say
that
in
that
respect,
with
the
--
as
to
the
elementary
schools
that
we
would
go
beyond
judge
rives.
judge
rives
pointed
only
to
the
next
two
years
and
he
did
not
under
what
he
suggests
as
i
understand
it,
achieved
complete
desegregation
in
that
time.
he
sort
of
left
it
to
the
future
whether
it
went
on
two
year
--
two
grades
at
a
time
or
what.
and
that
thirdly,
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
court
below
should
--
should
require
the
school
board
to
set
forth
some
plan
for
elimination
of
segregated
faculties.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
return
to
a
comment
that
mr.
justice
brennan
made
as
mr.
latimer
was
closing
and
that
is
as
he
understood
it,
if
the
plan
worked
the
way
that
it
is
working
as
mr.
latimer
described
it
that
the
entire
school
system
would
be
desegregated
by
1971.
as
i
understand
this,
even
accepting
the
way
mr.
latimer
states
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
not
correct,
that
it
would
still
take
until
the
fall
of
1977
for
the
--
a
school
system,
the
school
system
as
such
to
be
desegregated
and
that
is
because
of
the
effects
and
the
remnants
of
the
initial
racial
assignment.
now,
as
mr.
latimer
described
it,
it
is
easy
for
negroes
who
live
closer
to
a
white
school
than
to
a
negro
school
to
get
out
of
the
initial
racial
assignment
which
they
are
in
because
they
went
to
that
school
the
year
before
when
the
--
in
the
grade
that
was
not
desegregated
at
all.
but
that's
all
he
said
that
was
--
that
it
was
easy
for
the
negro
student
to
get
out.
however,
he
does
it,
whatever
the
physical
arrangement
is,
by
going
to
the
near
white
school
or
whatever
else
it
does,
he
has
to
make
a
move
which
shifts
him
from
a
school
that
he
has
been
going
to
because
it
was
a
negro
school
to
another
school
because
he's
closer
to
it
and
he
meets
whatever
other
requirements
the
school
board
put
on
top.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
no
matter
how
easy
that
transfer
system
is,
that
it
does
not
answer
the
requirement
of
a
desegregated
or
a
nonracial
school
system.
for
one
thing,
it
--
it
does
not
in
itself
answer
the
point
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
made
earlier
which
is
the
question
of
a
white
school
to
which
the
negro
student
is
close,
which
is
already
fall.
in
answer
to
that,
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg,
mr.
latimer
said
that
a
negro
student
close
by
that
went
into
that
would
displace
white
students
already
in
and
they
would
presumably
have
to
go
somewhere
else.
but
that
is
not
a
school
system
working
on
a
--
on
a
nonracial
system
necessarily.
it
--
it
has
racial
facts
--
factors
to
start
with.
the
--
and
a
related
point
to
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
in
preserving
negro
schools
as
such
was
--
which
it
does
through
this
initial
racial
assignment,
it
is
going
to
maintain
systems
of
overcrowding,
conditions
of
overcrowding,
a
negro
schools
that
a
school
board
normally
were
not
for
racial
considerations
would
cure
of
itself
by
rezoning,
by
changing
attendant
systems
or
by
whatever
means
they
chose,
they
would
--
it
would
at
least
be
a
situation
that
a
school
board
would
normally
look
to
and
try
to
cure.
and
in
--
in
this
--
this
period
of
remnants
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
understand
what
that
means
that
he
--
he
will
go
to
the
school
to
which
he
assigned
--
is
assigned
unless
he
wants
to
change.
mr.
burke
marshall
and
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
now,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
--
as
i
understood
that,
mr.
latimer
was
describing
the
way
transfers
worked.
the
way
they
worked,
that
the
way
that
you
worked
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
would
be
easiest
if
i
described
it
in
terms
of
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
what
mr.
latimer
was
describing
was
a
change
which
the
school
board
was
making
or
was
going
to
make
in
response
to
judge
bell's
per
curiam
opinion
after
the
original
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
correct
the
record.
and
judge
bell,
at
that
time,
said
that
the
school
board
had
to
eliminate
all
factors
in
dealing
with
transfers
that
made
it
more
difficult
for
a
negro
who
had
already
in
a
school
because
he
was
a
negro
to
get
out,
then
it
would
make
it
to
--
for
a
white
student
to
transfer
from
one
school
to
another.
and
if
i
can
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
approving
that
is
wrong
then
because
they
are
talking
in
terms
of
transfers.
they
are
talking
about
a
school
system
which
is
perpetuated
by
--
in
terms
of
initial
racial
assignments
but
in
which
they
have
made
it
easy,
as
easy
as
possible
for
negro
students
who
are
still
or
put
into
school
or
go
to
a
school
because
they
went
there
last
year.
and
they
went
there
last
year
because
it
was
a
negro
school,
no
matter
where
they
came
from,
that's
why
they
went
to
it,
make
it
easy
for
them
to
get
out
rather
than
the
school
board
reorganizing
the
school
system
so
that
no
student
is
in
the
school
because
he's
a
negro
in
the
first
place.
mr.
burke
marshall
what
--
whatever
else
you
say,
the
negroes
that
are
in
the
negro
high
schools
now
in
the
9th
grade
next
fall
will
be
there
because
they're
negroes.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
i
would
--
if
--
if
we
were
in
the
district
court
and
we
were
suggesting
plans
for
the
district
court,
i
would
agree
with
her
but
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
i
know
enough
about
the
atlanta
school
system
or
--
or
--
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
constitutional
requirement,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
maybe
the
best
plan
for
atlanta,
i
do
not
know.
