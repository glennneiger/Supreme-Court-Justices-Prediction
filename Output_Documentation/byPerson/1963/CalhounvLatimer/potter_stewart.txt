justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure,
senator
motley,
i
completely
understand
the
system
in
atlanta.
the
--
there
is
no
junior
high
school
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
such
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
high
school
--
high
school,
on
the
other
hand,
begins
not
on
the
9th
grade,
that's
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i'm
familiar
with,
but
in
the
8th.
justice
potter
stewart
for
five
--
high
school
is
for
five
years.
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
are
separate
school
buildings,
the
high
school,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
larger
schools
than
the
elementary
school.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
they
accommodate
generally
the
pupils
from
three
or
four
different
elementary
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
these
zones
overlapped
geographically?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
they
will
take
in
one
house
and
the
--
and
the
house
right
next
door
would
be
in
a
different
zone
and
then
the
one
next
to
it
will
be
in
the
first
zone?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
agree
that
subject
to
problems
of
physical
capacity
that
proximity
of
home
to
school
is
--
is
relevant
--
a
factor
as
any
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
i
follow
that.
i
should
think
in
1970,
we're
talking
about
six
years,
but
i
should
think
in
1971,
there
would
be,
as
i
understand
the
plan,
a
--
a
complete
desegregation.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
--
but
also
in
that
year
in
the
first
grade,
there's
no
application
involved
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
have
applied
the
previous
year,
second
years
from
the
second
grade
through
the
12
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they've
applied
in
previous
years,
previous
to
1971,
they
will
have
been
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
beginning
in
1971
in
the
first
grade,
everywhere
from
the
first
grade
and
thereafter.
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
goes
to
the
school
in
their
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
september,
the
first
time,
there
will
presumably
be
some
negro
children
going
to
integrated
schools
against
their
wishes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
some
of
the
white
children
go
into
an
integrated
school
against
their
wishes
and
those
of
their
parents?
justice
potter
stewart
of
proximity.
justice
potter
stewart
results
in
that
and
presumably
it
will
in
some
cases,
will
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
or
aren't
you
that
there
seems
to
be
lurking
in
your
suggestion
perhaps
that
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
constitution
requires
the
atlanta
school
board
to
affirmatively,
to
integrate
the
races
in
the
school?
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
understand.
that's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
but
assuming
that
there
were
no
problem
of
capacity,
would
a
rule
requiring
children
to
go
to
the
school
nearest
their
homes,
even
though
this
resulted
in
de
facto,
all
colored
schools
or
all
white
schools
in
some
instances,
would
that
be
constitutional
in
your
view
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
--
i'm
looking
at
this,
how
many
white
children
are
going
to
school
with
negro
children?
justice
potter
stewart
the
figure
would
be
much
larger,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
gather
in
--
in
atlanta
and
typically
elsewhere,
it
--
when
there
is
desegregation,
the
negroes
remain
a
very
small
minority
in
white
schools
rather
than
vice
versa.
isn't
that
the
picture?
justice
potter
stewart
would
be
a
very
much
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
--
wasn't
the
entire
premise
behind
the
second
brown
decision,
the
proposition
that
there
were
--
or
might
--
there
were
or
might
be
great
variations
among
communities
in
terms
of
their
local
laws
and
their
--
and
very
--
many
other
factors
and
that
--
and
that
louisville
and
baltimore
and
washington
might
have
quite
different
problems
from
birmingham
or
augusta
or
new
orleans?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
the
big
cities
quite
different
problems
from
rural
areas
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
so
what
is
the
experience
of
louisville
really
got
to
do
with
the
problem
here
and
on
the
experience
of
omaha
and
nebraska
has
to
do
with
the
--
that
of
birmingham,
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
in
view
of
the
basic
premise
of
the
second
brown
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
that
these
were
local
problems
to
be
worked
with
--
locally
worked
out
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
individual
variations.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
see,
what's
the
situation
elsewhere
in
the
state
of
georgia
by
way
of
desegregation
of
the
school?
justice
potter
stewart
so
as
of
now,
in
the
university
of
georgia,
justice
potter
stewart
and
savannah.
justice
potter
stewart
and
atlanta.
justice
potter
stewart
which
one
--
yes,
we
all
--
this
is
a
--
you
talk
or
i
talk
about
negro
students
being
assigned
to
white
schools
where
--
where
guilty
of
unconstitutional
talk.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
which
we
--
was
approved
by
this
court
i
suppose
in
shuttlesworth
case,
one
of
the
many
shuttlesworth
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
declined
to
disapprove
it.
justice
potter
stewart
we
declined
to
disapprove
it
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say,
this
original
criteria
have
now
dropped
out,
haven't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
now
the
only
test
are
what
--
if
somebody
now
in
the
--
in
the
10th
grade
wants
to
transfer
to
a
different
school,
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
period
and
if
they
do
live
closer,
they
automatically
can
transfer,
if
they
don't
they
automatically
are
prohibited
from
it,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
live
closer
they
can,
if
they
don't
live
closer,
they
can't
and
there's
no
room
discretion,
is
that
the
one?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
your
position
to
be
as
i
think.
you
understand
it
correctly
that
regardless
of
what
locality
we're
talking
about
and
regardless
of
whether
it
be
only
a
temporary
and
transitional
phase
of
a
rational
plan
of
gradualism,
if
it's
possible
to
have
such
a
thing
that
any
system
which
starts
out
along
a
preexisting
racial
school
district
is
per
se
unconstitutional.
let's
--
let's
assume,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
case.
i
think
i'm
right
or
maybe
wrong
in
thinking
that
birmingham,
alabama,
doesn't'
have
any
school
integration
as
so
far.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
--
let's
assume
that's
correct
or
x
city
in
alabama.
and
let's
assume
a
--
in
--
in
obedience
to
a
court
decree
asking
the
school
board
to
come
out
with
a
plan
that
they
come
up
with
a
plan
which
provides
for
starting
of
a
long
existing
line
for
the
school
year
1964.
but
that
by
the
year
with
--
with
free
possibility
of
--
of
transfer
on
permission
of
the
school
board.
and
that
by
the
year
1966,
there
will
be
a
complete
of
obliteration
on
any
racial
district.do
you
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
you
did
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
one
does
end
up
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
started
from
the
top
down?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
rather
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
--
what
you
pointed
there
--
there
are
fifth
circuit.
this
case
is
from
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there
are
other
fifth
circuit
decisions
seemingly
inconsistent
with
this.
justice
potter
stewart
obviously
you
have
many
white
--
white
students,
who
would
be
below
the
average,
wouldn't
you?
well,
you're
conceding
this
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
you
only
have
one
seat
available.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said,
the
initiative
came
from
the
board,
you
--
you
asked
them
if
they
wanted
to
be
transferred
or
did
you
require
them
to.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
initiative
now?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
even
--
you
don't
have
it
even
from
the
1st
to
the
--
through
the
7th
grade?
justice
potter
stewart
bolling

bolling

sharpe.
