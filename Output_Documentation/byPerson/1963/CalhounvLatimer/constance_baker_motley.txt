ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
filed
in
january
1958
involves
atlanta,
georgia's
school
desegregation
plan
before
this
court
for
review
upon
the
granting
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
judgment
affirmed,
as
modified,
in
order
of
the
trial
court
by
2-to-1
decision.
judge
richard
t.
rives
dissenting
on
the
original
hearing
and
on
petition
for
rehearing.
the
trial
court
flatly
refused
to
discard
atlanta's
original
court-approved
plan
which
became
effective
in
september
1961.
now,
before
getting
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
state
what
we
believe
to
be
the
issues
presented
by
this
case.
the
first
issue
here
is
whether
brown
allows
a
school
board
to
reassign
negro
children
on
a
racial
basis
and
then
require
them
to
apply
for
transfers
to
white
schools.
or
whether
brown
requires
southern
school
authorities
which
established
separate
system,
one
for
negroes
and
one
for
whites
to
now
integrate
those
systems
into
a
unitary
nonracial
system
by
doing
away
with
the
dual
school
zone
lines
upon
which
the
dual
school
systems
are
based.
now,
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals'
approval
of
a
greater
year
plan,
nine
years
after
this
court's
first
brown
decision,
comports
with
this
court's
present
concept
of
deliberate
speed.
the
third
issue
involves
the
teachers.
here,
it
takes
the
form
of
whether
brown
precludes
the
state
from
maintaining
negro
and
white
schools,
by
maintaining
separate
staffs.
the
plan
presently
before
the
court
evolved
from
a
plan
approved
by
the
trial
court
in
1960.
the
trial
court
approved
the
plan
which
provides
for
a
greater
year
beginning
with
the
12th
grade
and
descending
a
greater
year
thereafter.
under
the
plan,
negro
children
were
all
reassigned
to
negro
schools
and
white
children
were
all
reassigned
to
white
school.
then
the
plan
permitted
children
in
the
12th
and
11th
grade,
two
grades
in
which
the
plan
began
because
the
year
was
skipped
by
the
trial
court
awaiting
action
by
the
georgia
legislature,
children
in
the
grades
to
which
the
plan
applies
are
then
permitted
to
apply
for
transfer.
and
those
transfers
were
then
considered
with
relation
to
17
pupil
assigment
criteria,
which
in
practice,
as
the
record
showed,
applied
only
to
negroes
seeking
transfers
to
white
schools.
now,
this
plan,
which
the
trial
court
approved
in
1960,
continued
the
separate
school
zone
lines
on
the
elementary
school
level.
there
are
separate
zones
which
related
to
the
negro
schools
and
then
there
were
separate
zones
which
related
to
the
system
of
white
schools
on
the
elementary
level.
the
trial
court's
plan
continued
the
feeder
system
which
begins
when
you
graduate
from
elementary
school
in
the
7th
grade
and
you
go
to
high
school
in
the
8th
grade.
the
feeder
system
feeds
three
or
probably
four
elementary
schools
into
a
previously
designated
high
school,
so
that
the
high
schools,
in
effect,
do
have
zone
lines
consisting
of
the
three
or
four
elementary
school
zone
lines
which
feed
into
their
high
school.
so
the
court-approved
plan
in
the
first
instance
continued
that
system.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
junior
high
school.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
in
the
8th.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
now,
in
1962
after
the
plan
had
been
in
effect
a
year,
we
went
back
into
the
trial
court
and
tried
to
get
a
new
plan.
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
discard
the
plan
which
it
had
approved.
then
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
modified
the
plan
to
require
the
application
of
whatever
criteria
were
being
used
by
the
school
board
at
that
point
to
all
students
seeking
transfer,
not
just
negro
students.
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
showed
that
negroes
applied
for
transfer
between
may
1st
and
may
15th
each
year.
then
during
the
rest
of
the
year,
when
negroes
sought
transfer
to
negro
schools
and
whites
to
white
schools,
they
were
permitted
to
transfer
on
the
other
criteria
or
they
were
called
informal
transfers.
so
that
the
plan
operated
only
as
to
negroes
seeking
transfers
to
white
schools
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"you
can't
do
that.
whatever
criteria
you
use
have
to
apply
the
old
transfers."
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"you
should
apply
with
criteria
of
the
plan
when
children
leave
the
elementary
school
going
to
high
school.
the
plan
should
be
applied
it
said,
to
all
students
new
to
a
grade
which
the
plan
had
reached."
and
in
1964,
which
is
this
year,
the
plan
will
reach
the
8th
grade.
so
the
trial
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"now,
when
those
children
move
from
elementary
school,
apply
the
criteria
of
the
plan.
they
are
new."
and
those
were
the
major
modifications.
but
the
court
of
appeals'
plan
permitted
the
continuance
of
the
dual
zones
for
the
elementary
school
level.
this
is
the
foundation
of
the
separate
school
system,
the
dual
zone.
it
also
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
the
superintendent
testified
that
where
the
areas
are
mixed
racially
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
with
respect
to
the
housing.
they
will,
in
effect,
overlap.
that's
in
the
record.
now,
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
happens
is
that
atlanta
is
such
a
large
school
system
that
it's
divided
into
five
administrative
areas.
each
administrative
area
has
a
supervisor.
and
those
--
that
supervisor
gets
together
with
the
principals
in
his
area
and
they
determine
the
lines.
now,
there's
one
area
called
"area
1"
and
that
is
the
negro
school
system
and
it
has
a
negro
supervisor.
and
so
he
gets
together
with
the
negro
principals
in
the
negro
elementary
schools
and
they
determine
the
lines
for
the
negro
elementary
schools.
and
these
lines
are
related
largely
to
the
problem
of
capacity
of
the
school.
you
see,
they
draw
a
school
zone
line
not
with
--
with
relation
to
proximity
alone
because
you
may
not
be
able
to
fill
the
school.
so
you
draw
the
line
until
the
school
is
filled
with
its
capacity.
and
then
when
negroes
live
in
outlying
areas,
the
original
trial
record
show,
they
will
bust
in
from
their
white
area
where
they
live
into
a
negro
school.
now,
that
original
record
isn't
before
the
court
but
the
school
board
appeal
in
this
case.
and
they
didn't
go
through
with
their
appeal
but
they
printed
the
record
and
--
and
that
will
--
that
earlier
testimony
is
there.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
also
postponed
indefinitely,
as
the
trial
court
did,
consideration
of
the
teacher
issue.
we
had
urged
trial
court
to
require
the
school
board
now
to
come
in
with
a
plan
for
reassignment
of
teachers
on
a
nonracial
basis
because
as
we
pointed
out,
the
brown
case
talked
about
systems,
a
transition
from
a
segregated
system
to
a
system
not
operated
on
the
basis
of
race.
so
the
brown
case
required
disestablishment
of
the
dual
systems
which
meant,
as
we
see
it,
not
only
the
reassignment
of
pupils
on
some
reasonable
nonracial
basis
but
the
reassignment
of
teachers
and
the
elimination
of
all
other
distinctions
in
the
operation
of
the
school
system
based
on
race.
now,
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
respondent's
claim
that
beginning
in
the
school
year
1964,
there
will
be
one
criterion
applied
with
respect
to
request
for
transfer
and
that
is
proximity.
however,
their
plan
will
still
require
students
in
grades
9
through
12
to
apply
for
transfer
that
is
under
the
plan,
as
it
has
operated
so
far,
there
are
150
negro
students,
approximately,
attending
white
schools
--
white
high
schools.
now,
the
other
negro
students
who
are
still
in
negro
schools
in
grades
9
to
12
still
have
to
apply
for
desegregation
under
their
plan.
their
plan
will
apply
the
proximity
criterion
to
those
leaving
the
7th
grade
and
going
to
the
8th
grade
this
year.
now,
that's
proximity
criterion,
as
i
have
pointed
alone,
is
not
sufficient
if
you
live
near
a
school.
that's
not
a
good
test
because
you
may
live
in
a
densely
populated
area.
and
you
may
have
a
school
to
accommodate
600
or
800
and
there
are
2000
in
the
area,
so
it's
not
proximity
alone
but
they
propose
to
assign
children
on
that
basis.
now,
in
atlanta,
most
of
the
negro
high
school
children
live
near
the
negro
high
school.
and
they're
overcrowded.
our
exhibit
7
gives
all
of
the
figures
on
the
overcrowding
in
the
negro
schools
and
the
superintendent
admitted
that
the
problem
of
overcrowding
was
greater
in
the
negro
schools
because
there
are
fewer
negro
schools
although
negroes
are
45%
of
the
school
population,
so
that,
that's
an
insufficient
criterion
on
which
to
permit
people
to
transfer.
we
say
that
what
they
should
do
is
to
draw
a
school
zone
line
which
relates
to
the
capacity
of
the
school
because
they
have
--
i
think
in
the
record
it
shows
13
white
high
schools
un-enrolled
whereas
every
negro
high
school,
there
are
only
five,
now,
has
overcapacity.
the
turn
--
the
high
school
has
--
1000
more
than
it
was
build
to
hold
for
example.
now
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
it
--
it's
a
relevant
factor,
yes.
but
as
i
say,
proximity
alone
is
not
the
basis
on
which
they
draw
these
school
zone
lines
or
nor
could
they
because
the
population
maybe
dense
in
one
area
and
sparse
in
another.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
so
that
the
lines
as
actually
drawn
relate
to
capacity.
now,
under
the
present
plan,
as
set
forth
in
their
brief,
in
grades
1
through
7,
the
separate
school
attendant's
area
line,
which
the
superintendent
describes
at
page
61
to
62
of
the
record,
will
remain
in
effect
in
grades
1
through
7,
the
separate
school
zones.
and
students
in
these
grades
cannot
even
apply
to
transfer.
now,
when
the
plan
ultimately
reaches
the
first
grade
in
1971,
then
they
will
apply
to
students
entering
the
1st
grade,
the
criteria
of
the
plan
which
as
they
say
now
the
criterion,
which
they
say
is
now
proximity.
so
that
beginning
in
1971,
for
the
first
time
in
atlanta,
we
will
have
the
plan
commencing
in
the
1st
grade
on
the
criterion
of
proximity
alone
and
that
will
move
up
a
greater
year
until
it
gets
to
the
7th
grade.
so
that
in
1978,
we
will,
for
the
first
time,
have
the
separate
zone
system
eliminated.
in
short,
atlanta
will
finally
desegregate
their
schools
18
years
after
the
plan
was
first
approved.
and
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
this
court
held
racial
segregation
in
public
education
unconstitutional.
now
as
i
say
the
first
time
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
in
1971,
the
plan
would
have
allowed
everyone
in
the
school
system
from
12
to
1
to
apply
for
transfer.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
you
--
you
will
then
be
--
the
criteria
of
the
plan
which
is
proximity
would
then
be
applied.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
everyone
in
grade
2
will
still
be
in
a
desegregated
school
only
if
they
have
applied
and
have
met
the
criterion
and
has
been
accepted.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
if
they
have
applied.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
and
then
that
first
grade
moves
up.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
other
words,
there's
no
further
application
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
because
you've
been
assigned
on
proximity.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
and
for
the
first
time,
we
will
have
in
the
elementary
school,
people
in
a
grade
on
the
same
basis,
one
criteria.
now
this
also
starts
in
the
8th
grade
this
year.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
plan
will
begin
to
move
not
down
but
--
well,
while
it's
moving
down,
it'll
also
move
up
with
the
8th
grade
having
been
assigned
on
that
criterion.
so
they're
moving
up
on
the
8th
grade
and
down
to
the
elementary
school,
then
he
gets
to
the
first
grade,
it
moves
up
again
on
another
basis.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
no
--
no
one
will
be
--
will
have
been
in
school.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
beginning
in
the
8th
grade
this
year,
they
will
apply
that
proximity
criterion
and
presumably,
there'll
be
some
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
in
the
8th
grade
as
they
move,
that
is
from
the
elementary
school,
from
the
7th
grade
to
the
first
year
of
the
high
school,
the
8th
grade,
they
will
apply
their
single
criterion,
proximity.
now
if
it
were
school
zone
lines
which
they
were
applying
related
to
capacity,
you
would
have
some
whites
going
to
negro
schools
for
the
first
time.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
and
other
things
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
if
the
criterion,
a
single
criterion
is
applied
and
if
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
proximity
itself
results
in
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
--
in
some
cases,
it
might,
but
the
best
chance
for
it
to
result
in
integration
is
to
draw
those
high
school
lines
on
the
basis
of
capacity.
so
that
--
those
overcrowded
negro
schools
will
shift
into
the
white
high
school.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i'm
suggesting
that
it
requires
them
to
disestablish
the
separate
zone
system
which
they
established.
in
the
separate
zone
system,
when
they
redraw
those
zones,
there
can
be
some
all
negro
schools
and
some
all
white
schools
resulting
from
residential
segregation.
and
that's
what
we
say
brown
requires
you
to
do
to
disestablish
the
separate
systems
which
you
established.
and
they
had
established
a
separate
system
by
establishing
separate
zones
in
these
separate
feeder
system.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
and
that's
what
we
say
brown
requires
you
to
do.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it'll
be
perm
--
that
rule,
i
think,
would
apply
once
the
school
system
had
redrawn
the
school
zone
line
or
whatever
the
basis
for
the
segregation
is.
if
they
then
make
the
rule,
once
having
disestablished
a
separate
system,
if
they
then
make
a
rule
that
you
go
to
the
school
nearest
your
home
and
it
applies
across
the
board,
i
think
that's
alright.
and
of
course,
there
will
always
be
people
who
want
to
transfer
for
valid
educational
reasons
like
somebody
in
an
academic
high
school
may
decide
he
can't
do
that
work
once
it
transferred
to
a
vocational
high
school.
now
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
court's
approval
of
this
12-year
plan,
nine
years
after
brown
comports
with
this
court's
present
concept
of
deliberate
speed.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
does
not
in
view
of
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
watson
and
goss.
i
think
that
petitioners
--
respondents
rather,
haven't
demonstrated
that
there
are
presently
any
administrative
problems
in
atlanta
which
prevent
them
from
immediately
desegregating
all
the
schools
in
atlanta
in
september,
1964.
now
the
trial
judge
specifically
asked
them
to
come
in
with
testimony
to
show
that
the
plan
which
we
had
proposed
to
speed
it
up
could
not
be
speeded
up
and
they
never
did.
and
that's
on
pages
153
to
154
of
the
record.
now
if
there
were
some
administrative
reasons
within
the
categories
enumerated
by
this
court
in
the
second
brown
decision
which
prevented
after
decade
desegregation
in
atlanta,
they
would
have
come
in
and
they
would
have
demonstrated
that
to
the
court.
and
in
their
brief
here
they'd
only
suggest
any
administrative
reason
which
the
court
enumerated
in
the
second
brown
case
why
there
can't
be
immediate
desegregation.
now
finally
on
the
teacher
issue,
we
say
that
the
state
cannot
continue
under
brown
to
maintain
negro
and
white
schools.
and
the
way
that
maintain
negro
and
white
schools
under
their
transfer
plan
such
as
we've
had
here,
is
by
maintaining
separate
staffs.
now
the
superintendent
testified
that
the
policy
was
to
assign
negroes
to
negro
schools
and
whites
to
white
schools.
teachers
apply
their
contracts
approved
by
the
board
but
he
does
the
assignment,
the
superintendent.
so
that
when
a
school
has
an
all
negro
staff
or
an
all
white
staff,
that
labels
that
school
as
a
negro
school
or
white
school
as
much
as
they
had
put
a
sign
over
the
door
saying
negro
and
white.
now
they
claimed
they've
eliminated
all
labels
from
their
records
but
this
is
a
far
more
effective
label
in
the
judgment
on
the
community
than
a
label
in
a
--
a
record
book
because
everybody
knows
that
that
separate
system
means
negro
school,
white
school.
now
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
to
remand
this
case
with
direction
to
reassign
all
students
in
atlanta
in
1964
pursuant
to
nonracial
capacity
related
school
zone
lines
that
each
elementary
and
high
school
reassign
all
teachers
and
assign
all
future
teachers
on
the
basis
of
qualification
and
need
and
without
regard
to
race
and
remand
it
with
directions
through
the
district
court
to
enjoin
any
other
distinction
in
the
operation
of
the
school
system
based
wholly
on
race
and
color.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
first,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
read
from
the
record
to
settle
once
and
for
all
this
question
of
whether
there
are
zone
lines
on
the
elementary
school
level.
now,
on
page
62
of
the
record,
preceding
this
on
page
61,
i
went
into
this
matter
with
the
superintendent
as
to
zone
lines.
i
first
went
back
to
1960
before
the
plan
took
effect
and
asked
him
how
the
students
were
assigned.
and
then,
we
finally
got
to
the
end
of
it
after
several
questions.
and
he
--
i
asked
him
this,
"and
you
still
have
separate
lines
which
relate
to
the
negro
schools
and
separate
lines
which
would
relate
to
the
white
elementary
schools,
is
that
right?"
and
he
said,
"roughly,
yes."
now,
prior
to
that
on
page
61
at
the
bottom
--
near
the
bottom,
i
asked
him,
"now,
in
the
areas
where
the
housing
is
mixed
racially,"
that
is
the
areas
where
negroes
and
whites
live
in
the
same
area,
"these
lines
would
overlap
so
to
speak,
wouldn't
they?"
and
then
he
said,
"well,
formerly,
the
lines
were
drawn
separately
for
white
and
negro
schools,"
and
i
said,
"and
how
are
they
drawn
now?"
he
said,
"they're
drawn
on
the
basis
of
the
pupil
assignment
law."
and
i
said,
"do
you
mean
by
that
the
law
of
the
plan,"
and
he
said,
"the
plan,"
top
of
page
62.
and
then
we
went
on
and
i
said,
"and
you
say
the
lines
are
drawn
pursuant
to
that?"
answer,
"the
same
lines
that
were
in
existence
in
1960
aren't
existence
at
the
present
time".
"i
see,"
and
then
i
went
on
to
the
question
and
answer
i
read
before.
and
judge
reeves,
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
points
out
that
the
district
court
and
the
majority
simply
overlooked
the
record
and
he
put
this
testimony
in
a
footnote,
i
think
it's
footnote
4,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
regarding
the
fact
that
there
are
zone
lines.
and
he's
--
he
points
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
this
majority
opinion
represents
a
step
backward
for
the
fifth
circuit
because
they
had
just
said
in
augustus
and
in
bush
that
you
must
do
away
with
the
dual
school
zone
lines
and
he
says
he
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
he
says
there
were
none
and
that's
why
judge
reeves
quoted
this
testimony
in
a
footnote.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that
--
that's
right.
he
--
he
just
didn't
make
any
finding
at
all.
he
just
approved
the
plan
which
had
been
approved
in
1960.
and
we
complained
of
course
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
pointed
that
out
and
judge
reeves
quoted
and
said,
"you're
just
overlooking
the
record.
here
it
is."
now,
as
to
the
negro
high
school
situation,
we
put
in
the
exhibit,
which
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
7,
which
came
up
here
in
its
original
form
which
has
every
elementary
school
and
beside
the
names
of
the
elementary
schools,
i
put
an
end
for
those
schools
which
are
negro
elementary
schools.
the
superintendent
agreed
those
were
right
in
the
record.
then
the
last
page
of
the
record
contains
the
high
schools
in
atlanta
beginning
with
archer,
bass
and
so
forth.
and
the
check
marks
on
that
exhibit
are
the
negro
high
schools
and
it
shows
five
negro
high
schools.
now,
as
he
said,
they
have
built
one
since
that
and
that's
harper,
so
that's
six
negro
high
schools.
then
they
have
one
negro
vocational
school
which
is
karp.
now,
that's
in
the
record
as
to
the
number
of
negro
schools.
now,
the
problem
here
is,
as
you
can
see,
is
a
case
where
the
facts
were
always
changing.
the
district
court,
we
had
one
set
of
facts.
we
had
a
plan
with
12
--
17
criteria
and
so
forth.
as
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
had
abandoned
all
the
three
or
four
of
the
criteria.
so
we
had
another
situation.
in
their
brief,
they
said
the
sole
criterion
is
proximity.
on
this
argument
for
the
first
time,
we
hear
its
free
choice.
now,
there
has
never
been
published,
as
far
as
we
know,
any
document
by
the
school
board
which
says
what
the
plan
is
going
to
be
in
september
1964.
we
have
not
seen
any.
and
if
the
lawyers
can't
keep
up
with
the
changing
facts
and
different
plans
in
this
case,
you
can
imagine
the
situation
of
the
parents
at
atlanta.
but
what
is
the
school
board's
plan?
and
that's
why
this
court
must
establish
standards
based
on
this
record.
so
that
for
once
and
for
all,
we
can
have
standards
to
guide
the
district
courts
with
respect
to
what
kind
of
desegregation
is
acceptable
at
this
point.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
our
first
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
our
first
objection
is
that
it's
a
still
a
12-year
plan
which,
in
fact,
is
an
18-year
old
plan
before
it's
entirely
desegregated
that
is
until
students
are
assigned
throughout
the
system
on
a
single
criterion
or
the
same
criterion.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
we
opposed
that
kind
of
delay
10
years
after
brown.
that's
our
first
objection
to
their
plan.
they
have
never
abandoned
the
12-year
featured
any
point.
so
that's
our
first
objection.
our
second
objection
is
that
negro
students
have
to
apply
for
transfer
in
grades
9
to
12
or
make
some
request
or
do
something
to
get
out
of
a
negro
school
and
one
that's
over
crowded
particularly.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
can
only
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
if
--
if
--
he
has
now
changed
what's
written
on
page
14,
that
is
the
second
paragraph
on
that
page
which
i
read
--
read
to
require
some
kind
of
transfer
on
the
part
of
negro
students
in
grades
9
to
12.
now,
if
he
has
now
changed
that
and
you
no
longer
have
to
apply
for
transfer
in
grades
9
to
12,
you
have
this
free
choice
business.
we
object
to
that
because
we
think
that
any
free
choice
business
in
this
situation
will
not
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
brown
decision.
this
will
shift
to
the
negro
community
the
burden
of
desegregating
the
schools
which
we
say
brown
has
put
on
the
school
board.
and
you
see,
what
they
would
then
be
relying
on
is
the
momentum
of
100
years
of
segregation
whereby
habit
and
custom,
negroes
have
traditionally
gone
to
negro
schools
and
that's
the
way
it
will
be.
and
they're
saying
in
effect
that
if
you
want
the
schools
desegregated,
negroes
will
now
have
to
apply
for
admission
to
white
school.
and
we
say
that
brown
put
on
them
the
duty
to
reassign
everybody
on
some
reasonable
nonracial
basis
to
disestablish
the
segregation
which
the
state
established.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
in
this
situation,
we're
dealing
with
what
a
school
board
must
do
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
brown.
i
say
that
a
free
choice
system
would
not
satisfy
those
requirements.
it
doesn't
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that
--
that's
right
because
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
because
what
we
then
do
by
that
is
to
shift
the
burden
of
desegregation
to
the
negro
community
from
the
school
board.
we
understood
that
brown
put
on
the
school
board
a
duty
to
disestablish
segregation
which
the
state
had
set
up.
free
choice
will
operate
to
shift
that
duty
to
the
negro
community
to
come
forward
and
to
now
apply.
now,
there's
a
conflict,
as
i
see
it,
between
the
circuits.
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
northcross
case,
which
we
cited,
dealt
with
this.
and
they
said
that
negro
children
cannot
be
made
to
apply
for
that
which
this
court
has
already
said
they
were
entitled
to.
and
in
that
case,
the
sixth
circuit
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
this
is
not
forcing
anyone
to
go
to
a
school
that
they
don't
want
to
go
to.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
--
yes.
i
don't
think
brown
said
that
you
could
not
have
such
a
plan,
that
is
brown
did
not
say,
"we
condemn
free
choice."
now
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
if
i
recall.i
don't
recall
that
specific
fact,
your
honor,
in
the
brown
case.
i
think
they
--
somebody
mentioned
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
mean
in
the
bolling
against
sharpe.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
if
there's
a
free
transfer
system
and
--
and
if
there
was
in
the
district
of
columbia
operated
within
the
segregated
framework,
that
is
negroes
are
free
to
go
to
any
negro
school
and
whites
free
to
go
at
any
white
school
prior
to
bolling
against
sharpe.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
after
bolling
against
sharpe?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
--
i
thought
somebody
said
that
there
was
a
school
zone
line
system
established
after
that
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
i
would
say
that
if
a
school
board
has
maintained
for
100
years
segregation
and
they
now
say,
“free
transfer”
that
that
would
not
make
the
requirements
of
brown
because
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
what
i
understand
baltimore
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
because
what
you
have
is
substantially
all
negro
schools
and
all
white
schools
now
in
baltimore
because
what
happens
is
that
negroes
continue
to
go
to
those
negro
schools,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
this
carries
with
it
the
momentum
of
100
years
of
segregation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it's
--
it's
free
choice
and
it
doesn't
operate
to
do
what
brown
intended
the
decision
to
do
and
that
is
to
make
the
school
authorities
which
had
established
the
segregated
system.
as
the
eighth
circuit
said,
“disestablish
it.”
and
then
you
can
put
free
choice
or
anything
else
you
want
on
that
disestablished
system.
but
you
have
to
undo
a
century
of
segregation.
and
you
can't
say
to
the
negro
community,
“you
undo
it.”
by
now
coming
forward
and
what
happens
is
a
negro
child
applies
to
go
to
a
white
school
and
he
is
maybe
the
only
one
and
then
he
is
in
an
isolated
situation.
whereas
brown,
we
say,
guaranteed
him
not
the
right
to
apply
for
admission
to
a
white
school.
brown
guaranteed
him
the
right
to
go
to
a
nonracial
school
system.
and
in
way
you
have
free
choice
on
top
of
100
years
of
segregation.
what
you're
doing
is
preserving
segregation
and
giving
a
negro
child
a
right
to
apply
for
admission
to
a
white
school.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
the
atlanta
situation,
i
think
this
court
should
now
require
atlanta
to
draw
a
school
zone
line
related
to
capacity
without
consideration
of
race,
that
is
they
have
so
many
children
to
accommodate
in
the
22
high
school.
and
they
should
draw
a
school
zone
line
to
accommodate
this
high
school
population
to
fill
all
those
schools
to
its
capacity.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
once
drawn
on
the
basis
of
capacity
not
proximity
alone.
then
if
a
student
wants
to
transfer
for
some
valid
educational
reason,
of
course,
he
may
be
able
to
do
so.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
would
say
he
couldn't
transfer
because
of
race.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
understand
that.
it's
already
there.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
he's
then
in
a
desegregated
system
and
he
cannot
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
then
predicate
his
transfer
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
would
say
that
he
can't
--
if
the
school
board
commits
that
kind
of
transfer,
he
would
have
to
permit
it
for
whites.
the
white
person
will
say,
“well,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
this
all
--
disintegrated
school.
i
want
to
go
back
to
a
white
school”,
because
the
negroes
application
was
predicated
on
race.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
if
i
understand
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
would
say,
no,
no.
because
a
negro
doesn't
have
anymore
right
to
go
to
a
negro
school
than
a
white
person
has
to
go
to
a
white
school.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
suggest
it
as
the
minimum
as
if
--
sixth
circuit
said
and
as
the
fifth
circuit,
a
minimum
for
those
school
systems
which
have
--
had
100
years
of
segregation.
that's
the
minimum
requirement.
now,
there
maybe
something
that
can
be
done
later
to
facilitate
more
integration
which
we
don't
have
yet
in
this
case.
but
i
think
that
in
this
southern
school
system,
we've
got
to
first
get
a
