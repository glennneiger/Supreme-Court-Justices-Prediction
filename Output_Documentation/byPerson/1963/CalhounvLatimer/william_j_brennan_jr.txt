justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
exercise
of
that
choice
have
to
be
at
the
7th
grade?
you
said
under
some
pre-registration
system,
he
goes
to
whatever
is
the
high
school
of
his
choice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mechanically,
is
that
the
way
he
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
now
this
--
this
last
place
that
you've
told
us
about,
if
they
all
want
to
go
there
and
there
aren't
enough
seats
there,
then
i
gather
that
on
a
proximity
basis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
those
colored
children
going
into
the
8th
grade
who
near
--
lived
nearest
bass
high
school
will
be
assigned
to
bass,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
takes
care
of
the
8th
grade,
is
that
--
i
think
--
i
think
i
can
understand
it
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
9th,
10th,
11th
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
12th,
let's
use
the
9th
grade
youngster
now
who
lives
nearest
bass
high
school.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happens
to
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
seems
--
well,
let
--
let's
suppose
now
he's
at
one
of
these
predominantly
negro
high
schools
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
across
town.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he's
in
the
9th
grade
and
he'd
like
to
attend
bass?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
a
youngster,
his
sister
or
brother
going
in
the
8th
grade,
is
now
in
bass.
now,
what
specifically
does
he
have
to
do
in
order
to
get
into
bass?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
principal
of
which
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
bass,
may
i
just
--
this
one
other
illustration
again
for
having
a
rather
--
using
bass
high
school.
suppose
now
we
have
a
--
a
colored
youngster
living
across
the
street
from
a
colored
high
school,
attending
that
colored
high
school
in
the
9th
grade.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
his
parents
say
it's
overcrowded.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he's
willing
to
go
all
the
way
across
town
to
bass.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
in
september
or
whatever
your
registration
trade
is,
that
youngster's
parents
take
him
over
to
bass
and
register
him
in
bass.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
long
as
there
are
seats
there
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
latimer,
may
i
just
make
this
observation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
the
picture
you've
given
us
if
different
in
(inaudible)
like
from
the
picture
that's
been
given
to
us
by
senator
motley
and
mr.
marshall.
what
--
what's
the
--
this
wants
to
be
resolved
in
the
record
somewhere.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
a
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
first
grade
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ms.
motley,
was
--
what
about
baltimore?
isn't
free
transfer
you've
label
it
which
seems
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
what
baltimore
is
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
contested
in
baltimore
the
system
there
didn't
meet
the
requirements
of
brown?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it's
not
free
choice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
--
in
this
line
of
situation,
as
mr.
latimer
has
described
before
us,
the
matters
of
(inaudible)
within
the
briefs
of
the
record,
as
he
described
for
us,
what
is
it
that
you
think
we
should
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thus
limiting
the
children
within
the
particular
zone,
two
of
the
high
school
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
standard
you
suggest,
mrs.
motley,
a
standard
you're
suggesting
is
the
only
thing
that
could
comply
with
the
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
mean
one
has
to
register
before
the
school
year
begins
in
speaking
of
high
school.
everyone
registers
and
as
i
understand
it,
he
registers
wherever
he
pleases
at
that
junction
and
--
except
in
the
incidence
where
there
is
overcrowding
because
of
too
many
application
receipts
in
that
particular
school,
he's
going
to
go
to
the
school
of
his
choice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
--
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
latimer
told
us
was
that
--
that
there's
no
business
of
assignment,
and
as
i
understood
him
this
is
all
on
the
premise
of
--
the
way
it's
going
to
work
as
mr.
latimer
described
it
for
us,
all
bets
are
off
for
the
past.
you
start
in
september
1964
and
you
go
to
any
school
you
want
to
register.
there's
nothing
else
you
have
to
do,
you
don't
have
to
go
back
to
the
school
you've
been
attending,
there's
no
application
for
transfer
of
that
school
involved.
you
merely
go
to
the
school
and
register
where
you
want
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
high
school
alone,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
but
he
didn't
use
the
term--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
--
did
he
said
he
didn't
care
what
they
--
what
--
what
label
you
put
on
it,
that
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
that
youngster
and
his
parent
go
to
the
particular
high
school,
a
youngster
wants
to
go
and
there,
he
registered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
join
ms.
motley,
the
only
solution
here
even
on
mr.
latimer's
premise,
is
the
one
she
suggested?
