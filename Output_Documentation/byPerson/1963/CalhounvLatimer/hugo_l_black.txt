ask
you,
assuming
what

says
is
correct
as
to
the
plan
and
the
way
the
school
will
be
operated
from
going
back
to
the
time
he
said,
what
are
your
objections
with
atlanta
plan?
what
--
what
would
be
your
objections
with
atlanta
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
the
plan
as
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
why
i
was
asking
you
to
discuss
the
--
your
ideas
on
the
basis
of
what
he
said.
there's
the
plan
that
they
intended
to
carry
out
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
we
should
strike
down
as
unconstitutionally
the
idea
of
the
freedom
of
choice
on
the
part
of
the
children
and
the
parents?
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
--
then
you
do
say
that
we
should
hold
that
they
should
not
be
given
freedom
of
choice
by
reason
of
the
argument
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
put
us
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
we
--
did
we
pass
on
whether
they
could
be
forced
to
go
to
the
school
they
didn't
want
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
we
pass
on
the
question
--
maybe
we
did
but
i'm
not
--
i
don't
understand
you're
saying
with
us.
did
we
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
a
plan
which
allowed
the
children
and
their
parents
choose
between
the
schools
which
condemned
by
our
decision?
i
thought
it
was
an
open
question
maybe
it's
not.
