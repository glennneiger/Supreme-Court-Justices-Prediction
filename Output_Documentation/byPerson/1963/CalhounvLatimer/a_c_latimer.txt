mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
arguing
this
case,
i
find
myself
in
the
role
of
a
lawyer
who
tries
his
own
case.
this
came
about
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
when
this
suit
was
initially
filed,
i
was
a
member
of
the
atlanta
board
of
education.
i
am
no
longer
a
member
of
that
board
but
its
attorney.
and
i
trust
that
in
appearing
in
this
dual
capacity
that
i
will
not
run
afoul
of
the
(inaudible)
that
a
man
who
represents
himself
in
court
has
a
full
four
o'clock.
at
the
threshold
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
try
to
explain
what
the
atlanta
plan
is
and
i
mean
by
that,
what
the
atlanta
plan
is
in
1964,
now
and
in
september
of
1964
and
not
what
the
plan
was
in
1961,
in
september,
when
atlanta
started
on
the
desegregation
plan.
but
gentlemen,
this
is
a
moving
thing.
it's
an
evolutionary
process.
because
as
we
understand
the
rulings
of
this
court
and
other
courts,
you
allow
us
a
pupil
assignment
plan
as
a
vehicle
to
go
from
a
totally
desegregated
system
since
1874
when
our
system
was
found
to
an
integrated
or
desegregated
system.
and
we
view
that
vehicle
as
something
that
you
allowed
us
to
use,
not
as
a
roadblock,
but
to
smooth
the
way
along
and
they
say
one
picture
is
worth
10,000
words.
and
i
saw
this
cartoon.
it
showed
a
road
and
there
were
some
bumps
in
it.
and
they
showed
a
steamroller
and
on
the
road
was
desegregation,
the
brown
decision.
and
on
the
steamroller
was
pupil
assignment
plans
and
it
showed
the
southern
city
with
a
steamroller
as
a
roadblock
across
the
road.
we've
tried
to
use
that
vehicle
to
smooth
out
some
rough
spots
and
to
achieve
an
end
which
we
know
we
must
achieve.
in
this
connection,
it
had
been
stated
that
the
atlanta
plan
was
based
upon
the
plan
considered
in
birmingham,
the
shuttlesworth
case.
and
even
in
itself,
this
statement
is
misleading
for
the
atlanta
plan
is
initially
instituted
was
almost
verbatim,
copied
from
the
birmingham
plan
which
was
the
only
plan
that
at
that
time
that
had
received
the
approval
of
this
court
even
in
a
preliminary
way.
but
as
this
plan
has
devolved,
as
we
began
with
this
plan
of
shuttlesworth,
including
all
its
various
criteria,
many
of
these
criteria
and
many
of
the
things
contained
in
that
plan,
were
voluntarily
abandoned
by
the
atlanta
school
board
as
serving
no
useful
purpose
and
serving
no
educational
purpose.
gentlemen
at
one
time,
as
a
placebo
or
sugar
pill,
to
make
some
of
these
acceptable
to
our
community,
there
were
many
things
in
the
plan
such
a
many
parents
requested
that
we
put
in
the
plan
and
have
the
court
approved
it,
the
right
to
segregate
by
sexes.
let
the
girls
go
to
one
school
and
the
boys
to
another.
it's
never
been
used.
it's
not
contemplated
to
be
used.
it's
not
even
a
(inaudible).
but
many
of
these
criteria
are
hurdles
that
were
there,
were
put
there
following
what
we
thought
shuttlesworth
had
said
that
these
criteria
could
be
used
as
a
transfer
complaint.
now
during
the
first
year,
the
record
shows
that
only
three
of
the
criteria
we
use,
we
did
the
first
year.
i
will
admit
unconstitutionally
test
all
of
the
applicants
for
transfer
and
that
application
on
his
test
must
make
a
score
which
would
equal
the
average
of
the
grade
to
which
he
sought
transfer.
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
us
that
you
have
some
negroes
do
it,
though
not
as
well
qualified
and
you
also
have
some
white
students
who
possibly
wouldn't
pass
that
test.
so
the
second
year
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir,
that's
right.
now
during
the
second
year,
no
special
tests,
i
want
to
show
a
motion,
a
movement
forward.
during
the
second
year,
no
special
tests
were
given
to
these
children.
we
simply
used
a
citywide
test
that
all
children
take.
we're
constantly
testing
our
children
in
the
school
system
to
determine
if
the
product
we
are
selling
or
developing
is
progressive.
so
we
did
away
that.
that
shows
some
motion
forward.
we
did
away
with
that
special
test.
judge
rives
even
on
his
--
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
said
that
we
gave
the
personality
test.
we
did
give
a
personality
test
the
first
year
of
1961.
now
if
it
please
the
court,
that
test
was
to
try
to
make
the
atlanta
plan
work.
he
was
to
bring
these
kids
in
and
tell
them,
"look,
here's
what's
expected
of
you.
here's
what
we're
going
to
do.
here's
what
we
expect
of
you.
and
this
plan
must
work
because
this
community
devoutly
wanted
this
plan
to
work."
now,
let
me
say
this
that
generally
speaking
at
atlanians
and
georgians
did
not
want
to
start
on
a
program
of
desegregation.
but
above
that
desire
was
a
desire
to
be
law
abiding
and
two,
under
no
circumstances
with
my
community
ever
abandon
public
education.
our
few
section
that
of
our
community,
for
what
was
known
as
the
pupil
tuition
grants
acts,
as
we
thought
unconstitutional
and
not
serving
any
useful
purpose
to
our
community
and
quite
expensive.
now
in
1962,
we
infringed,
in
1963,
we
went
further.
no
special
tests
were
given.
no
personality
tests
were
given.
but
the
tests
that
were
normally
and
routinely
given
in
the
schools
was
still
greater
and
those
who
did
not
meet
the
average
of
the
medium
of
the
class
to
which
they
saw
transfer,
were
denied.
judge
bell's
opinion
came
out
and
by
the
way,
i
think
possibly
had
judge
bell
reversed
that
case,
we
might
not
be
here.
but
in
essence,
he
pointed
out
to
us
what
our
deficiencies
were
and
even
on
the
63
assignments,
all
those
who
had
in
the
sense
been
tested
out
or
called
back
in
and
this
criteria
was
used
and
this
only,
do
you
still
want
to
transfer?
yes.
well
now,
you
must
live
closer
to
the
school
to
which
you
seek
transfer,
then
the
school
from
which
you
came,
which
we
think
is
--
is
constitutionally
acceptable.
now,
we
exa
--
reexamined
all
of
these
pending
transfers
and
granted
it.
atlanta
points
with
pride
to
these
accomplishments,
but
in
reply,
our
opponents
say
that
we
still
operate
a
dual
or
biracial
system
of
schools.
and
that
our
plan
will
never
accomplish
complete
desegregation.
in
addition,
they
say
that
in
terms
of
results,
we
promised
an
eagle
and
produced
only
tomcat.
that
after
three
full
years,
under
this
atlanta
plan
that
some
150
negro
students
are
now
attending
formally
all
white
schools.
now,
viewed
in
terms
of
numbers,
this
argument
is
a
powerful
one.
even
allowing
for
the
factors
of
geography
and
residential
patterns
which
the
lower
courts
recognized
taken
in
prospective
however,
any
argument
based
on
numbers
alone
is
--
is
an
argument
that
has
got
to
be
--
you've
got
to
take
into
consideration
when
you're
talking
about
numbers,
the
overall
plan
and
it's
all
like
the
story
of
a
man
who
hired
an
itinerate
mathematician
to
work
for
him,
told
him
he
would
pay
him
one
cent
a
day
and
double
it
each
day
thereafter.
and
if
you
recall
that
story,
the
--
on
the
10th
day,
he
owed
him
$10.23
i
think,
it
was.
at
the
end
of
30
days,
the
30th
day
it
was
$5
million
and
some
$23
million
or
$24
million
over
the
whole
30-day
period.
now,
we
bring
that
story
to
illustrate
this.
we
don't
propose
to
take
30
years
to
desegregate
the
atlanta
system.
we
don't
propose
to
do
it
tomorrow
if
we
allowed
gradualism.
but
we
do
want
to
show
that
atlanta
plan
and
in
the
mean
voluntarily
is
in
motion
and
has
moved
forward.
now
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
but
we
want
to
point
out
this
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
you.
i
would
say
this
that
they
reassigned
100,000
pupils
overnight
incidentally,
would
create
many
problems.
many
problems
nothing
to
do
with
race
but
you
would
disrupt
neighborhood
patterns,
you
would
disrupt
transportation
patterns,
extracurricular
activities
and
such.
but
i
think
when
--
let
me
say
here
if
i
may,
what
is
the
atlanta
plan
today?
now,
for
and
what
the
atlanta
has
done
voluntarily,
following
what
atlanta
learned
from
other
district
court
and
circuit
court
cases
and
your
various
rulings
and
followed
after
the
rather
extensive
surgery
in
judge
bell's
opinion.
here's
what
the
atlanta
plan
is
in
1964,
it's
first,
choice,
second,
space,
third,
proximity.
now,
let
me
explain
that
if
i
may.
traditionally,
atlanta
has
been
what
we
call
an
open
city
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
boys
all
and
girls
all
over
the
city
went
primarily
to
boys
high
school,
which
was
downtown
and
girls
high
school,
which
was
downtown,
and
they
came
from
all
over
the
city.
and
at
2
or
3
o'clock
when
they
went
home
to
(inaudible)
the
community
because
everything
merged
through
the
center
of
town,
transportation-wise,
so
we
went
back
to
a
community
high
school
and
we
took
our
old
junior
highs
and
converted
them
to
high
schools.
now,
that
policy
of
children
going
pretty
much
where
they
want
to
has
still
remained
in
the
atlanta
system.
normally
and
ordinarily,
children
go
to
the
school
nearest
to
their
home.
so
we
would
like
if
we
may,
be
permitted
to
do
so
because
we
think
that's
best
by
our
community
to
let
children,
pretty
much
have
and
their
parents
a
choice
of
where
they
go
to
school.
now,
you
would
recognize
immediately
that
administratively,
if
they
all
decided
to
go
to
the
same
school,
and
some
schools
are
just
an
old
school,
some
a
little
bit
of
area
than
others
and
such.
that
the
administrator
and
you've
recognized
it
all
through
your
writings
that
the
local
school
board
has
to
run
the
school
system,
that
the
local
administrator,
the
superintendent
then,
would
have
to
use
some
way
of
determining
whether
that
who's
--
shall
go
to
the
school
if
more
apply
for
the
school
than
we
have
facilities.
so
then
you
would
use
proximity
as
a
limiting
factor
there.
that
is
three
children
apply
for
the
same
seat
in
the
school
room,
in
the
same
building.now,
how
do
you
go
and
determine
which
gets
the
seat?
well,
the
one
that
lived
nearest
to
the
schoolhouse.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
but
--
and
we
are
--
some
580
classrooms
shy
and
we
have
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
build
it
day
and
night
to
cure
that.
now,
as
far
as
the
plan
is
concerned,
one
of
the
complaints
of
the
petitioners
is,
you
come
down
12,
11,
10,
9,
you're
down
to
8.
nine,
eight,
where
the
feed
of
system
takes
hold,
the
court
has
told
you
and
this
was
part
of
the
surgery
that
you
must
now
reassign
those
children
that
go
--
formally
went
--
negro
high
--
negro
--
formally
all
--
negro
all
elementary
to
negro
high,
formal
white
to
white
high.
now
that
you
must
reassign
these
children
with
an
evenhanded,
in
an
evenhanded
manner,
without
regard
to
race
and
that
we
are
going
to
do.
and
on
that
basis,
the
child
can
go
to
the
high
school
of
his
choice
leaving
the
7th
grade,
going
to
the
8th
grade
with
these
factors
that
i've
enumerated,
taken
in
proximity
and
so
forth.
now,
that
does
away
certainly
with
the
8th
grade
with
the
duel
system,
but
you
say,
what
about
the
poor
kid
in
9,
10,
11
and
12,
who
didn't
make
it
here
on
that
magic
date
and
get
an
original
assignment
or
reassignment?
well,
it's
this
simple.
since
judge
bell's
surgery,
the
difference
between
a
transfer
and
assignment
in
atlanta
is
tweedle-dee,
tweedle-dum.
now,
let
me
illustrate.
assume
a
colored
child
lives
directly
across
from
a
formerly
white
high
school
and
he's
in
this
9th
grade
we're
talking
about,
he
can
get
there
simply
by
he
and
his
parents
going
across
the
street
and
going
through
the
ordinary
process
that
any
child
goes
through,
to
be
admitted
to
a
school.
we
have
pre-registration
as
you
do
here
and
everywhere,
go
there
and
let
it
be
known
that
he
wants
to
go
there
and
it
will
be
granted.
in
other
words,
since
judge
bell's
opinion,
we
believe
that
all
that
is
left
of
the
atlanta
plan
is
a
greater
year
from
seven
down.
now,
it
is
true,
if
they
charge
us
with
a
biracial
system
there,
that
is
true,
but
we
thought
shuttlesworth
--
shuttlesworth
approved
that.
that
is,
you
fire
the
gun
on
opening
day,
each
went
back
to
the
schools
where
they
formally
attended
with
a
right
to
transfer
out.
now,
in
most
of
those
cases
you
read,
if
it
please
the
court,
you
will
find
that
there
are
method
of
getting
out.
they
had
to
jump
a
lot
of
hurdles.
did
judge
wright
said
in
the
bush
case,
they
had
to
stand
muster.
some
of
the
judges
said,
they
had
to
ask
for
something
that'd
already
been
granted
to
them.
now,
we've
tried
to
give
a
free
system
of
transfers,
because
in
1963,
after
judge
bell's
opinion
came
down,
we
called
in
each
one
of
the
applicants,
asked
them
if
they
wanted
to
be
transferred
and
all
who
lived
nearer
to
the
formally
white
school
who
still
wanted
to
go
there,
were
transferred.
now
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
--
no,
sir.
we
contacted
each
one
and
their
patents,
we
asked
them
to
come
to
city
hall
where
the
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
school
board
is.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
met
there
and
explained
to
them
that
we
had
been
operating
under
one
theory
but
that
we
have
been
told
we
could
not
do
that.
that
they
had
a
constitutional
right
and
we
wanted
to
give
them
that
right
and
afford
them
that
right
that
even
though
it
was
late
in
the
day,
we
would
speed
up
everything
in
the
way
of
processing
their
transfer.
and
some
40,
50,
60,
i
don't
remember
how
many,
said,
“yes,
we
still
want
to
transfer,”
and
they
were,
and
they
win.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
there's
a
total
of
about
24,
is
my
recollection,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
24
high
schools
of
which
some
eight
or
nine,
possibly
ten
are
predominantly
negro
high
schools.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
not
many,
not
many.
we
built
a
new
harper
high
school,
it's
right
lush,
right
then,
so
many
want
to
go
to
harper
that
we've
had
refused
some
of
the
transfers
because
it's
becoming
overcrowded
but
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
on
the
1964
plan.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir
and
they
go
to
the
nearest
high
school,
they
simply
by
the
informal
method
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
they
may,
because
of
choice,
space,
proximity.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
well
produced
--
sometimes
that's
for
good
educational
reasons.
we
had
a
boy
that
wanted
to
go
to
west
point
and
he
couldn't
find
the
particular
math
course
in
the
high
school
that
was
merely
across
the
street
from
it.
for
good
educational
reasons,
he
went
across
town.
now,
i
would
not
say
we
would
encourage
that
because
i
don't
--
i
think
a
kid
could
use
his
time
a
whole
lot
better
studying
on
the
athletic
field
and
going
way
across
town
and
our
transportation
is
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
have
in
atlanta,
k
7125
v,
as
kindergartens,
seven
years
of
elementary
school,
five
years
of
high
school,
12,
total
and
v,
vocation.
now,
we
don't
have
three
changing
theories.
ordinarily
and
normally,
a
child
goes
to
two
schools
in
atlanta,
he
goes
to
an
elementary
school
for
seven
years.
he
then
leaves
elementary
schools
and
goes
to
high
school.
now,
without
taking
up
any
time
to
explain
those
systems
which
was
constitutionally
defective,
the
feeder
systems
faired
into
the
high
schools.
now,
the
child
leaving
the
7th
grade
will
receive
an
initial
assignment,
a
call
to
transfer,
call
it
anything
you
want
to.
when
he
leaves
the
7th
grade,
that
child
now
has
a
choice
of
attending
the
high
school
of
his
choice.
now,
if
it
--
that
fills
up,
then
you
use
proximity
as
a
limiting
factor
to
determine
which
child
gets
the
seat.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir,
we
have
pre-registration.
they
go
and
let
it
be
known
why
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
that's
the
way
the
--
and
--
and
that's
the
way
he
still
and
has
always
done
except
in
the
past,
you
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
that
is
a
real
good
question
and
it's
one
we
wrestle
with
for
the
past
13
years
that
have
had
anything
to
do
with
atlanta
school
system.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we've
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
it
won't
be
cured
then
because
of
the
changing
neighborhood
patterns
of
urban
remote
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
renewal,
the
express
way
systems
and
such.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
have
in
any
fine
schools,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
because
of
the
--
the
neighborhood
going
to
industrial
and
commercial
and
nothing
to
do
with
race,
the
patrons
have
moved
out.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
there
are
other
areas,
white
and
negro,
this
is
not
peculiar
and
the
record
shows,
this
is
not
peculiar
distantly,
but
that
in
many
areas
that
are
fast
growing,
we
can't
keep
up
with
them.
now,
the
immigration
of
the
negro
to
atlanta
is
as
largely
proportionate
as
it
is
to
chicago
and
other
eastern
city,
it
is
tremendous
because
we
have
labor
market
there
and
we
have
certain
things
that
we
are
proud
of
there.
but
one
reason
for
the
overcrowding
of
the
negro
schools,
more
so
than
the
white,
is
because
the
attendants
charts
show
the
white
within
the
city
limits,
population
going
down
and
the
negro
population
going
up
and
they
have
met,
i
think,
in
last
year
or
so.
but
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
now,
let
me
answer
that
two-way,
if
--
if
i
may
please
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
one,
when
are
we
talking
about?
now,
if
1961,
1962
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
we
consider
the
time
it
began,
september
1961,
when
we
started.
and
in
those
three
short
years,
we
think,
we've
taken
monumental
strides,
but
to
try
and
answer
your
question,
in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
have
attended
zones.
now,
the
record,
page
61,
62,
77
show
that
there
are
some
lines
in
atlanta
but
those
are
administrative
lines.
we
divide
the
city
into
four
or
five
administrative
areas,
where
we
have
an
area
superintendent
and
they
have
under
them
what
we
call
super
teachers,
resource
people,
you
see.
now,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
attendants'
signs
as
far
as
school
is
concerned.
now,
to
go
on
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
now,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
do
that
for
this
reason.
to
view
in
effect,
you
--
it
is
historical,
you
must
go
back
and
put
yourself
in
the
situation,
the
place
and
the
times.
now,
under
state
law
and
i
know
under
the
cooper
ruling
that
that
doesn't
give
us
any
comfort
but
it
is
a
fact,
sir,
that
our
funds
would
be
cut
off,
we
were
subject
to
go
into
jail
and
all
these
factors.
judge
hooper,
the
district
court
judge
in
his
wisdom,
said,
“i
want
the
people
of
georgia
to
decide
that.”
so
he
deferred
the
due
date
from
september
1960
to
september
1961,
he
said,
i
will
make
it
catch
up
two
years.
now,
that's
the
reason
we
consider
that
we
started.
now,
i
know
your
writings
in
goss
or
watson
that
says
that
time
there
has
been
sharply
limited,
and
i
agree.
except
for
this
that
we
consider
that's
when
we
got
the
show
on
the
road.
now,
as
far
as
the
chief
justice's
question
is
concerned,
i
--
i'd
like
to
try
to
finish
answering
that
if
may.
under
the
system
that
will
attain
in
atlanta
on
september
1st,
1964,
that
half
empty
high
school,
white,
predominantly
white
or
formerly
all
white,
can
be
filled
up
with
whites
or
negroes
or
students
simply
by
making
it
known
that
they
want
to
go
there.
this
may
be
one
way
of
filing
up
those
empty
classrooms,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
your
honor,
i
plead
guilty
to
that
as
--
but
pass
but
we
say
so
that
in
all
due
respect,
that
that's
ancient
history,
now,
that
has
been
abandoned.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
think
it
would
probably
take
the
rest
of
my
lifetime
and
the
lifetime
of
my
son,
who's
watching
me
in
the
court
today,
and
i
mean
that.
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
disrespectful.
but
i
--
i
mean
that
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
we
have
such
a
fast
growing
system.
that
in
the
few
years,
i've
had
anything
to
do
with
it,
we
spent
some
$40
million
or
$50
million,
a
bond
money
to
build
new
classrooms
and
as
soon
as
we
get
one
school,
collier
heights
for
instance
through,
we
have
to
go
back
and
double
the
size
over
there.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
let's
take
bass
high
school,
formerly
all
white.
bass
high
is
in
a
--
in
an
area
which
is
going
industrial
and
commercial.
let's
say
that
its
capacity
is
1500.
let's
say,
they
illustrate
its
now
down
to
900.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir,
alright.
now,
let's
take
howard
high
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
haven't
put
in
any
because
we
were
going
with
this
vehicle
at
that
time
on
an
assignment
basis.
now,
your
honor,
we'd
--
we
can't
do
that
anymore
and
we're
not
going
to
do
it
anymore.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
did
do
that
but
we
don't
anymore
and
we
won't
in
1964,
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
sir,
we
don't
have
zones.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
don't
have
zones.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
those
are
administrative
zones.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
your
honor
--
i
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
plead
guilty
to
that
in
the
past
but
not
in
the
present
or
the
future.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright,
sir.
i
state
in
my
place
that
this
is
what
the
atlanta
board
of
education
is
going
to
do
and
we
can
ensure
that,
i'm
sure
by
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
would
--
but
these
changes
don't
come
about
until
the
beginning
of
a
new
school
year.
we
think
it
would
be
tragic
to
start
this
particular
thing
we're
talking
about
now
in
the
middle
of
a
school
term,
so
i
believe
that
--
that
all
would
agree
to
that.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
but
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir,
just
one
school
year.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
split
as
we
--
because
we
do
consider,
we
started
in
1961
and
then
we
--
we
have
moved
forward
to
the
best
of
our
ability.
now,
come
1964,
a
child
in
those
grades
that
have
been
reached
by
the
plan,
eight
of
them.
the
child
moving
from
the
elementary
to
high
school
will
receive
an
initial
assignment
on
a
non-racial
basis.
and
we
think
that's
constitutional
accepted
in
anyway.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
on
a
basis
of
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
we
assigned
him
to
this
--
to
the
school
he
chooses.
i
--
i
mean
where
he
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
bass
high
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
right,
right.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
we
use
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
it
would
then
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
you
see,
after
this
machine
--
first
is
choice
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
and
then
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
that's
right,
sir.
first,
his
choice,
second
is
whether
or
not
there's
available
space
for
the
child
and
if
there's
not
enough
available
space
then
you
use
the
fact
of
proximity
there
as
a
limiting
factor.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
what
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright
sir.
no
longer
does
he
have
to
go
through
or
jump
these
hurdles
or
take
test
or
apply
to
be
transferred.
if
he
will
let
his
--
that
fact
be
known
that
he
lives
near
bass
or
whether
he
lives
near
bass
or
not,
he
wants
to
go
to
bass
high
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
or
at
howard
high,
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
go
to
the
principal
of
the
school
and
register.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
bass
high
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
now,
they
would
administratively
call
back
over
to
the
school
where
he
went
and
now
he's
applied
for
a
transfer
over
here,
we'd
like
his
records,
we
have
permanent
records
on
every
child
have
to.
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
it's
just
not
going
to
be
a
scramble
situation
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
entirely,
we
have
certain
administrative
matters
that
have
to
be
gone
through.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
and
i've
made
a
bad
job
of
making
that
clear,
your
honor.
that
--
some
of
this
was
true
in
the
past.
what
we
are
saying
since
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
in
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
june
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
june
and
august,
1963
when
judge
bell
wrote
his
opinion
and
said
that
this
--
this
reassignment
from
elementary
to
high
had
to
be
done
on
a
non-racial
basis.
and
that
a
child
entering
a
class
--
a
child
new
to
a
class,
meaning
transfers
in
the
8th,
9th,
and
10th
grade
had
to
be
done
non-racially
too.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
how
many?
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
your
honor,
now,
the
plan
is
only
applicable
to
about
12,000.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
not
many,
something
less
than
100,
your
honor
because
unfortunately
that
decision
of
judge
bell's,
i
think
came
out
in
june.
they
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
--
en
banc.
that
was
denied
in
a
subsequent
clarifying
opinion
which
is
in
the
record,
came
out,
in
august,
some
time.
let
me
say
this,
basically,
we
are
down
to
this.
a
question
of
choice,
louisville
has
tried
it,
other
cities
have
tried
it.
there
must
be
a
seat
or
space
available,
a
teacher,
cafeteria,
the
library,
the
athletic
field
and
if
four
applied
in
that
school,
we'll
handle.
then
we
would
say
the
fairest
test
i
know
of
is
to
give
the
seat
to
the
child
who
lives
nearest
to
the
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
absolutely,
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
if
he
could
--
he
--
he'd
--
he'd
exercise
his
second
choice,
it
maybe
all
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir,
as
an
in-system,
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no
sir,
no
sir.
we
said
that
proximity
would
be
the
test
--
the
determining
factor
there.
and
if
the
negro
child
is
closer
to
that
high
school
he
would
have
the
choice
--
he
would
have
the
proximity
factor
working
in
his
favor,
not
against
him,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
is
true.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
that's
right.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
otherwise,
if
you
--
you
would
have
started
out
with
the
bad
situation
and
you
perpetuate
it,
that
--
that's
the
point
as
i
see
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
none.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
we've
abandoned
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
the
criteria
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
of
the
transfer.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
and
i
--
i
sort
of
jumped
into
this,
i
had
relevant
orderly
speech
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
i've
been
working
on
for
months
and
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
think
so,
i
probably
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
i
think
i
probably
would
have
been
more
effective
had
i
followed
this
written
speech
which
i
wouldn't
going
to
read
but
referred
to
and
gone
into
it
a
little
more
orderly
but
this
is
a
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
we
were
trying
a
damage
suit
or
tax
matter
or
labor
case,
the
record
is
then
ecstatic
and
it's
frozen.
this,
because
of
your
teachings
in
brown,
it
--
it
--
we
--
we
are
moving.
it's
like
a
ship
out
at
sea
then
it
sends
a
radio
message
to
tell
us
--
give
us
a
--
our
bearing
and
tell
us
where
we
are,
and
the
radio
operator
that
receives
it
is
asleep
and
he
doesn't
get
the
message
back
for
to
or
three
hours,
the
ship's
gone
home.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
it
is
a
problem.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
its
official
sufficient
adjudication,
as
far
as
a
--
a
school
board
can
officially
adjudicate.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
even
though
--
let
--
let
me
explain
this,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
white.
this
plan
took
effect
september
1,
1961.
april
30
of
1962,
mrs.
motley
filed
a
motion
for
further
relief.
now,
we've
gone
on
since
april
through
--
1963
and
up
to
whatever
it
is,
march
or
april
of
1964.
now,
if
i
could
convince
this
court
of
the
sincerity
of
the
atlanta
school
board
in
wanting
to
move
forward,
i
think
i
would've
done
a
good
job
and
i
--
i
do
say
this.
that
if
there's
any
question
about
it,
put
the
odd
on
because
make
no
mistake
about
it,
our
philosophy
since
the
first
round
decision
has
been
compliance,
not
defiance.
now,
it's
hard
for
me
to
argue
why
we
didn't
start
in
1958
when
we
read
that
decision
and
we
--
and
we
have
always
--
it
--
can
understand
that
procedure.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well
we
did.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
think
it's
the
only
thing
you
can
do
because
equity
cases,
you
retain
jurisdiction
and
all
the
time
you
say
and
move
forward
with
this
thing
because
we've
tried
to
use
your
plans
that
you
--
on
the
surface
approved
in
shuttlesworth
as
a
vehicle
to
go
from
a
total
desegregated
to
--
i
mean
to
segregate
it
to
a
desegregated
system.
we
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
because
we
don't
have
any
attended
zones
in
atlanta
now.
so
if
you
ordered
us
to
do
away
with
them,
it
would
have
absolutely
no
effect
on
the
way
we're
operating
our
school
system.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
let
me
explain
this.
dr.
letson
had
been
superintendent
over
a
year
less
when
his
depositions
were
taken.
in
the
record,
you
will
see
something
about
lines.
now,
traditionally,
i
state
in
my
place,
we
have
never
had
hard
and
fast
zone
lines,
a
square
or
triangle,
rectangle
or
circle,
put
a
dot
inside,
every
child
goes
into
that
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
didn't
notice
the
light.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
wanted
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
do
not
think
--
do
not
contend
that
mrs.
motley
is
in
anyway
misquoting
the
record.
the
difficulty
of
this
in
--
in
most
of
these
cases
isn't
this
record
is
what
we
say
is
ancient
history,
it's
two
years
or
more
older.
and
that
in
the
meantime,
atlanta
has
been
discharging
what
it
considered
to
be
the
requirements
of
the
brown
decision,
wherein
this
court
said
that
the
speed
of
a
plan
and
how
it
waits
and
so
forth,
is
first,
addresses
itself
to
the
local
school
authorities
and
second,
to
the
local
district
courts.
so,
i
make
that
statement,
i
don't
know
that
anybody
would
consider
that
mrs.
motley
has
misquoted
the
record
and
i'm
sure
she
is
--
has
not
and
would
not.
but
that
these
depositions
were
taken
sometime
along
in
june
of,
i
think,
1962
and
since
that
time,
we
have
tried
to
move
forward
with
our
plan.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
the
official
records
and
minutes
of
the
board
of
education
would
contain
that
portion
of
this
argument
that
we're
talking
about
which
concerned
those
applicants
in
1963
who
had
been
turned
down
on
the
testing
criteria,
who
were
called
back
in
and
told
that
they
could
go
to
the
school
of
their
choice
if
they
live
closer
to
it.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir,
i
do
not
think
we
do
have
precise
document.
i
might
suggest
this
your
honor
that
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record.
now,
we
could
probably
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
we
can
stipulate
here
and
now
what
the
atlanta
plan
is
as
of
this
time.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
summer
months
of
1963,
following
judge
bell's
opinion,
it
was
widely
publicized
the
effect
of
the
opinion
on
the
atlanta
plan.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
the
only
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
in
its
official
records
in
minutes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
by
recommendation
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
adopted
by
the
school
board.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
not
with
me,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
they
could
be
made
available.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
and
i
would
say
this,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
if
it
would
be
helpful
in
anyway
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
and
state
positively
and
in
writing
what
the
atlanta
plan
is
and
what
--
what
they're
going
to
do
in
september
6,
what
they're
doing
now,
well,
we'll
be
glad
to
do
so.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
your
honor,
we
have
it
on
our
brief
in
the
state
of
georgia
filed
the
brief
of
amicus
in
which
they
state
that
the
plan
now
is
choice
of
a
space
and
proximity.
he
stated
i
think
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
i'll
be
looking
for
them
if
you
will.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i'm
reading,
mr.
justice
black,
from
page
1
of
the
brief
--
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
page
1.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
question
presented
whether
the
atlanta
plan
of
desegregation
of
public
schools
approved
both
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
constitutionally
defected,
one,
in
its
basic
approach
to
achieving
desegregation
through
application
of
assignment
of
pre
--
procedures
now
based
solely
on
consideration
of
choice,
space
and
proximity
on
the
grade
or
year
basis
commencing
with
the
high
school
grades
and
proceeding
down.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir,
except
that
the
--
the
question
is
so
stated.
now,
also,
your
honor,
in
the
brief
of
respondents,
page
14,
in
the
brief
of
the
united
--
in
the
brief,
united
states
makes
several
suggestions
with
reference
to
an
obvious
solution.
it
suggest
as
such
an
immediate
reassignment
of
all
students
on
the
basis
of
proximity
alone.
admittedly,
atlanta
has
recently
resorted
to
proximity
as
a
factor
in
making
transfers
but
for
administrative
reasons
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
start
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
14,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir,
bottom
of
page
14,
mr.
justice
clark.
admittedly,
atlanta
has
recently
resorted
to
proximity
as
a
factor
in
making
transfers.
but
for
administrative
reasons,
atlanta
has
never
used
either
inflexible
zones
or
proximity
as
the
sole
criteria
either
at
the
first
of
the
high
school
level.
it
does
not
want
to
resort
solely
to
inflexible
zones
or
proximity
now.
it
based
with
the
choice,
would
prefer,
probably
prefer
a
system
of
complete
freedom
of
choice
conditioned
only
upon
availability
of
space
would
resort
to
proximity
to
settle
priorities
between
two
applicants
where
facilities
were
available
for
only
one.
such
a
choice,
obviously,
there
is
no
relation
to
integration
or
segregation
and
would
be
consistent
with
either.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
sir,
i
don't
believe
i
made
myself
clear.
what
we
would
prefer
and
what
the
thrust
of
our
brief
is,
we'd
like
to
be
left
alone.
i
say
that
in
all
due
respect.
but
that
if
we
must
change,
which
these
cases
indicate
or
constantly
change,
then,
rather
than
fixed
rigid
zones
that
lock
people
in
of
either
race,
we
would
prefer
a
system
of
free
choice,
assuming
the
space
is
available
and
using
then
proximity
as
a
limiting
factor,
not
as
the
sole
factor.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
i
--
when
i
--
i
didn't
mean
exactly
what
i
said
apparently.
i
say
we'd
like
to
be
left
alone.
we
would
like
for
this
plan
as
we
have
it
now
and
as
we
envision
our
plan
to
run
its
normal
course.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
now,
let
me
--
excuse
me,
sir,
that
maybe
a
little
bit
deceptive
and
i
don't
want
to
be
because
the
schools
run
--
on
a
school
year
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
in
the
high
school,
in
those
grades
that
had
been
desegregated
says
judge
bell's
opinion,
the
difference
between
the
transfer
and
an
assignment
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
that's
so
hard.
i
won't
answer.
i
think,
educationally,
it
would
be
unsound.
but
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
--
to
adopt
the
philosophy
of
choice
first,
availability
and
then
proximity
that
it
may
require
that
result
in
same
instances.
i
think
as
a
practically
matter
that
it
will
not.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
hope
not
too.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
alright,
sir.
when
the
plan
started
out,
the
negro
child
went
back
to
the
negro
school
where
he
had
always
going
whether
he
or
she
had
always
going.
and
to
get
out,
he
or
she
must
apply
for
transfer.
and
the
first
year,
there
were
more
hurdles
and
then
--
and
--
and
they've
come
down
as
time
went
on.
as
we
read
judge
bell's
opinion,
that
grid
having
been
desegregated
in
the
atlanta
high
school
system,
she
no
longer
has
to
--
to
apply
through
a
formal
transfer
route
of
procedure
to
get
over
to
the
school
of
her
choice.
now,
let's
abandon
for
a
moment
the
word
"transfer"
or
"assignment",
let's
just
say
she
has
to
go
register.
all
students
must
register.
you
have
to
follow
a
certain
administrative
procedures
in
order
to
oddly
run
a
big
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
--
school
system.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
so
let's
use
the
word
"she
has
to
register".
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
and
that
could
be
the
closest
school
or
it
could
be
for
reasons
peculiar
to
her
that
she
wants
to
go
across
town
to
her
school.
now,
this
may
do
two
things.
it's
probably
a
--
a
two
headed
sword.
it
may
fill
up
some
of
these
half
empty
classrooms.
and
that's
a
problem
at
any
school
system.
but
not
all
of
that
is
bothered
about
by
race,
the
sum
of
that
is
just
purely
changing
neighborhood
pattern.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
now,
we
are
still
in
our
spin-off,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court
on
that,
i
--
it
--
it
--
we
are
saying
in
those
grades
which
the
plan
has
affected.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
do
not,
in
the
atlanta
school
system,
have
rigid
attended
zones.
now,
we
plan
to
gain
awards
in
the
place
because
--
take
the
school,
the
spring
street
school,
people
referred
generally
to
the
spring
street
school
area.
i
want
to
buy
a
home
in
the
spring
street
school
area.
i
--
i
live
in
the
spring
street
school
area.
but
insofar
as
the
school
board
and
the
superintendent,
drawing
hard
and
fixed
in
rigid
zone
lines
down
here
and
so
forth,
we
do
not
have
nor
have
we
ever
had.
now,
there
is
some
testimony
of
dr.
(inaudible)
that
says
this,
"where
a
particular
elementary
school,"
and
he's
referring
to
elementary
school,
and
then
we
point
out
that
the
plan
has
not
yet
reached
the
elementary
grades,
"that
where
a
particular
elementary
school
becomes
overcrowded,"
and
there's
one
not
too
far
from
there
that
is
not
overcrowded,
"the
principals
of
those
two
schools
get
together
and
they
say,
"look,
i'll
take
them
up
to
peachtree
street
and
you
take
them
beyond."
but
as
far
as
the
policy
of
--
that
is
actually
to
a
--
an
imaginary
line
to
prevent
overcrowding.
it
is
not
a
line
to
assign
children
on
the
basis
of
race
or
otherwise.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
back
to
where
he
has
been
going.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
then
he
would
be
assigned
to
spring
street
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
because
that
is
what
we
understood.
the
courts
had
approved.
they
said
it's
unconstitutional
to
segregate
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
but
because
of
the
equity
of
powers
of
this
court,
this
court
in
its
wisdom
says,
“we're
going
to
let
you
do
this
gradually
and
we're
going
to
weigh
and
balance
these
equities.”
now,
we
are
in
the
transition
period.
there'd
been
few
--
few
headlines
about
the
trouble
in
atlanta
because
we've
tried
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
do
this
in
a
--
in
a
fine
way,
which
i
think
we've
done.
but
we
are
still
in
the
transition
period
--
again,
i
say,
starting
in
1961,
motion
for
further
relief
filed
in
april
of
1962
and
we
are
trying
the
case
here
in
this
court
nearly
april
1
of
1964
based
on
1961
and
1962
facts,
that's
where
the
confusion
comes
in.
but,
your
honor,
the
--
we
are
in
--
still
in
our
spin-off
of
greater
years.
we
have
come
down
now
through
the
high
schools.
but
it
would
take
another
six
years
to
complete
that
course
for
the
elementary
schools.
and
then
at
the
end
of
that
time,
every
child
entering
the
elementary
grade,
the
first
grade,
would
receive
an
initial
assignment
just
as
we've
outlined,
choice,
space,
proximity.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
no,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
it's
the
--
the
--
it's
the
eighth
grader
who
is
the
first
year
of
high
school.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
next,
in
the
fall
of
september
of
1965.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
the
seventh
grade.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir,
seventh
grade.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
that's
right.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
that's
right.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
well,
that's
this
--
no,
sir,
the
eighth
grader
who's
moving
up
from
the
seventh
grade.
he's
graduated
from
the
seventh
grade
in
elementary
school
and
he's
now
moving
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
judge
bell
goes
into
that,
it
may.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
question
of
acceleration,
as
school
people,
we
would
prefer
that
the
plan,
which
takes
its
biggest
boost
in
september
of
1964,
be
allowed
to
continue
uninterrupted.
that
is
stated
because
we
understand
that
if
we
have
administrative
problems,
the
court
is
often
been
sympathetic
to
the
fact
that
the
size
of
the
school
system
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
is
what
do
you
do
to
them
by
way
of
a
plan,
roughly,
100,000
to
115,000
students
in
atlanta.
and
we
think
and
our
educators
tell
us
that
it
would
be
chaotic
indeed
to
reassign
initially,
all
at
one
time,
the
entire
school
system
on
some
plan
of
choice
or
some
plan
of
proximity
or
what
else.
now,
the
other
reasons
unconnected
with
race,
their
transportation
patterns,
their
school
associations,
their
academic
reasons,
extracurricular
activity
reasons
and
such,
why
we
think
that
the
process
that
we
are
in
now
would
best
serve
education
of
the
children
of
both
races
if
allowed
to
continue
to
the
plan
once
out.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes.
i
calculated
the
--
i'll
take
you
on
--
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
yes,
and
also
though,
the
children
new
to
the
--
to
the
school
system,
as
judge
bell
pointed
out,
must
receive
an
initial
assignment
on
a
nonracial
basis.
he
would
be
put,
as
your
honor
asked
the
question,
in
the
school
nearest
to
him
or
of
his
choice.
now,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
question
of
faculty
desegregation,
we
recognize
that
that
is
something
that
will
ultimately
take
place
in
atlanta.
we
have
started.
it
is
not
an
extensive
program.
i'll
state
to
you
quite
categorically,
there
are
no
negro
teachers
teaching
all
white
classes.
i
think
maybe
there's
one
in
--
in
the
trade
school,
i'm
not
certain
but
i
ask
you
as
to
any
extensive
use
of
a
negro
teachers
in
white
schools
that
has
not
come
about.
as
you
will
recognize,
we
may
require
children
to
go
to
school
but
we
cannot
require
teachers
to
teach.
and
we
have
the
problem
that's
universal
to
every
major
school
system
in
the
country
that
is
the
teacher
shortage.
we
actually
send
our
people
to
recruit
teachers.
they
go
into
the
colleges
and
the
classrooms
and
try
to
sell
them
on
coming
to
atlanta.
we've
tried
to
up
our
wage
scale
to
attract
them
there.
and
for
the
time
being
and
until
this
--
until
this
plan
runs
its
course,
we
would
much
prefer,
if
it
please
the
court,
to
differ
that
as
the
local
district
court
did
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
bearing
in
mind
please
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
not
been
timid
about
this
question.
in
the
jacksonville
case,
they
ordered
on
a
finding
of
fact
there
that
the
jacksonville
school
board
proceed
forthwith
with
the
desegregation
of
the
faculty
for
reasons
which
they
understood.
the
fifth
circuit
deferred
the
matter
of
desegregation
of
the
faculty
in
atlanta.
gentlemen,
if
there
are
anymore
questions,
i
--
i
would
be
most
pleased
to
answer.
i
would
say
this
that
in
all
fairness
to
all
concern,
record-wise,
we
could
not
come
here
and
defend
this
cold
record.
we
couldn't
do
it.
but
we
have
thought
that
our
obligation
was
to
move,
that
is
to
push
forward
to
use
the
assignment
plan
which
you
--
in
a
preliminary
way
approved
in
shuttles
way
as
a
method
of
means
of
getting
over
some
rough
places
in
the
road.
and
we've
got
some
more
to
go.
but
we
feel
that
educationally,
that
we
have
progressed
in
the
fields
of
extracurricular
activities,
there
is
no
distinction.
we've
eliminated
all
distinction
as
to
designate
schools
by
race.
but
in
passing,
we
would
say
that
arbitrarily
reassign
some
100,000
children
would
sacrifice
some
great
educational
reasons,
we
think
for
speed.
mr.
a.
c.
latimer
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
