you
may,
senator.
mr.

next

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
latimer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
latimer,
i
understood
senator
motley
to
say
that
as
a
result
of
your
segregationally
organized
zones
in
the
city,
all
of
the
negro
high
schools
were
overpopulated.
one
of
them
to
the
extent
of
1000
overpopulation
and
that
your
white
high
schools
were
underpopulated,
how
--
how
do
you
justify
that
if
--
if
--
on
the
basis
of
--
of
proximity
and
all
these
other
factors
that
you
reviewed,
why
do
you
continue
to
maintain
that
situation
when
it
deprives
students
of
a
fair
opportunity
for
a
good
education?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
won't
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
cured
until
1978
if
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
you
have
a
larger
number
of
white
high
schools
and
a
smaller
number
of
negro
schools
and
approximately,
the
same
number
of
students
of
both
--
both
races
through
your
--
your
segregated
zoning,
you
do
require
colored
students
to
go
farther
from
their
home
to
--
to
get
to
a
colored
high
school.
now
--
now,
how
can
you
justify,
basing
that
kind
of
segregation
on
the
fact
that
you're
just
trying
to
evolve
this
situation
when
at
the
same
time,
you
are
actually
depriving
children
of
a
decent
education
when
you
have
the
space
there
and
the
facilities
for
give
them
--
giving
them
the
--
the
opportunity
for
a
good
education
if
it
wasn't
for
your
racial
segregation
by
zoning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
from
--
from
1954
to
1978
--
from
1954
to
1978
when
you
say
that
the
segregation
will
be
eliminated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
you
transfer
them
away
from
their
home
and
make
them
--
make
the
request
to
come
back
close
to
their
home
when
you
have
--
in
the
school,
you're
sending
them
to
is
overcrowded
and
the
school
that's
close
to
their
home
is
under
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
can't
be
very
ancient
history
because
you
only
have
150
some
negro
students
in
the
whole
system
now.
and
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
to
--
to
fill
up
that
unused
space
and
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
to
--
to
take
away
the
overpopulation
in
the
overcrowded
negro
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
still
you
have
--
still
you
have
vacant
space,
a
lot
of
it
just
because
you
segregate
your
school
system
10
years
after
the
decision
of
brown
versus
board
of
education.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
900
there
with
a
capacity
of
1500.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
that
one,
how
many
negroes
have
you
put
into
that
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
assign
negro
students
out
of
the
proximity
of
that
school
to
a
negro
school
that
is
farther
away
from
their
homes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
do
it
as
long
as
those
zones
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
zone
was
based
on
--
based
on
race.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
then
i
completely
misunderstood
what
counsel
--
counsel
said
and
i
thought
you
--
you
yourself
said
that
there
were
zones
that
were
based
upon
race.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
whatever
they
are,
you
take
the
--
you
take
the
youngsters,
negro
youngsters
who
live
closer
to
a
school
that
is
a
white
school
and
move
them
farther
away
to
a
colored
school
with
the
result
that
that
--
the
colored
school
is
overcrowded
and
the
white
school
is
underused.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
it
been
remedied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
tell
--
tell
us
the
specific
action
that
you've
taken
to
remedy
it
then
what
the
situation
is
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
not
--
not
what
you're
going
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
told
me
it
had
been
eliminated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
particular
term,
you
had
--
you
had
20
terms
because
you
had
10
years
and
i
guess
you
had
two
school
terms
in
a
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
--
let's
say
10
terms
that
you
had
which
to
remedy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
he
--
can
he
walk
right
over
to
the
high
school,
the
white
high
school
and
register
there
or
under
your
system,
doesn't
he
have
to
first
go
to
a
negro
school
and
then
make
his
application
and
be
transferred.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
date
that
it
ended,
that
it
has
ended,
not
where
you're
going
to
end
it
but
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
is
the
date
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
have
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
was
the
result
of
that
in
--
in
negro
students
being
put
into
white
schools?
how
many
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
out
of
these
47
--
48,000
negro
students?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
say
12,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
of
them
--
how
many
of
them
were
--
were
put
in
those
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
latimer,
may
i
--
may
i
just
restate
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
and
ask
another
one
whether
--
where
the
--
the
negro
child
lives
in
close
proximity
to
an
extremely
overcrowded
negro
school
and
he
wants
to
go
to
--
to
a
white
school
which
is
under
populated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
even
though
he's
willing
--
his
parents
are
willing
to
--
to
undergo
the
--
the
discomfort
of
additional
travel
and
he
goes
over
there
and
applies
for
admission
to
that
school,
what
criteria
must
he
meet
in
making
that
transfer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
he
has
to
do
is
say,
“i
want
to
be
there.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
is
a
seat
--
if
there
is
a
seat
in
that
school,
he's
entitled
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
want
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
won't
say
that
i'm
mistaken
--
i'm
mistaken
in
the
--
in
a
lot
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
questions
that
i've
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
i
did
not
understand
it
with
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
latimer,
if
the
--
if
the
decree
recited
that
no
longer
should
there
be
anymore
racially
established
districts
or
zones
in
the
city
of
atlanta
and
that
in
the
future,
any
--
any
child,
negro
child
who
is
in
an
overcrowded
school,
has
the
right
to
be
admitted
to
an
underpopulated
white
school,
you
would
have
no
objection
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
latimer,
i
think
you
better
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
you
--
before
you
start,
there
--
where
you
in
somewhat
stated
confusion
because
of
the
different
approaches
that
you
and
--
and
counsel
for
the
petitioners
have
--
the
--
the
basis
of
your
arguments
and
so
i'm
going
to
extend
your
time
for
15
minutes
to
explore
these
things
and
mrs.
motley,
you
may
have
10
minutes
to
--
additional
to
reply
and
mr.
marshall,
you
may
have
5.
and
we'll
see
if
we
can
get
down
to
a
basis
where
we're
all
talking
about
the
same
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
have
any
--
any
resolutions
of
your
--
of
your
board
of
education
or
--
or
any
documents
of
any
kind
that
would
establish
this
new
policy
that
you're
talking
about
but
which
neither
counsel
nor
ourselves
seem
to
know
anything
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
we
have
documents
that
will
--
will
answer
the
precise
question
that
--
that
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
--
asked
of
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
the
right
of
--
right
of
the
colored
youngster?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
then,
do
you
have
any
documents
that
--
that
will
establish
your
answer
to
--
to
the
question
of
justice
goldberg
about
youngsters
who
do
go
to
school
under
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
can
we
establish
at
them
to
--
to
be
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
where
has
it
been
enunciated
in
--
in
a
public
way
prior
to
your
statement
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yeah
--
but
--
but
where
was
the
action
of
the
board
of
education
published?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pursuant
to
that,
pursuant
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
thereby
resolution
or
--
or
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
have
you
the
recommendations,
the
written
recommendations
of
the
board
of
--
of
the
superintendent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
they
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
you're
going
to
argue
it,
i
think
it
would
be
rather
a
good
thing
to
let
us
know
that
beforehand
so
we
would
have
some
idea
what
we
were
going
to
have
argued
here
in
court.
did
you
ever
--
did
you
ever
tell
counsel
for
the
other
side
what
the
plan
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
read
us
that
portion
of
your
--
of
your
brief
which
will
--
will
give
the
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
1?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
asking
a
question
answered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
latimer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
read
a
portion
of
your
brief
in
the
bottom
of
page
14
and
the
top
of
15
where
you
said,
"and
if
faced
with
a
choice
would
probably
prefer
a
system
of
complete
freedom
of
choice
conditioned
only
upon
availability
of
facilities
with
the
resort
to
proximity
to
settle
priorities
between
two
applicants
where
facilities
were
available
for
only
one.
such
a
choice
obviously
bears
no
relation
to
integration
or
segregation
would
be
consistent
with
either."
then
you
go
on
and
you
say,
"but
these
suggestions
are
beside
the
point.
atlanta
has
an
"obvious
solution".
once
it
becomes
clear
that
as
the
present
plan
progresses,
there
will
be
initial
assignments
without
regard
to
race.
in
short,
once
it
appears
that
the
freeze
in
of
existing
assignments
is
purely
transitory,
petitioners'
argument
that
the
atlanta
plan
is
inherently
unfair
is
--
is
eliminated."
now,
you
filed
this
brief
on
march
16th,
1964
and
what
were
you
talking
about
when
you
said,
"in
short,
once
it
appears
that
the
freeze
in
of
existing
assignments
is
purely
transitory"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
register
from
--
registering
from
choice,
the
school
of
her
choice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
latimer,
may
i
ask
you
this.
isn't
--
the
spring
--
spring
street
school
is
a
white
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
little
negro
child
lives
across
the
street
from
the
spring
street
school
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
say
he'
in
the
sixth
grade,
can
he,
under
your
system
at
the
present
time,
go
to
that
school
and
register?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
must
he
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
he's
an
outsider,
hadn't
been
to
any
school
in
--
in
atlanta,
he
comes
to
--
he
comes
--
lives
across
the
street
from
the
school.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
would
he
be
entitled
to
stay
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
where
would
he
--
where
would
he
have
to
go
--
you
say,
he'd
go
back
to
the
original
school
that
he
came
from
if
he
was
in
the
sixth
grade,
why
would
he
have
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
motley,
you
and
--
and
the
solicitor
general
may
speak
in
any
order
that
you
wish
and
you
could
rebuttal
just
--
just
as
you
--
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
high
school
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
it's
quite
evident
--
it
must
be
quite
evident
to
counsel
that
--
that
we
are
confused
about
this
situation
and
i
think
also
that
there's
some
confusion
among
counsel
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
before
we
decide
this
case,
we
want
to
know
what
facts
we
are
deciding
the
case
on.
if
there
is
anything
outside
of
this
record
that
we
must
decide
the
case
on
that
we
would
like
to
--
that
we
would
like
to
know.
if
--
so,
i
--
i
think
we
will
ask
counsel
to
or
counsel
for
the
school
board
to
prepare
a
memorandum
for
us
that
is
actual
in
nature,
not
a
brief
or
an
argumentative
brief
but
one
that
is
actual
in
nature
that
will
demonstrate
to
us
what
--
what
the
basic
facts
of
this
case
are
and
what
we
must
reach
in
order
to
--
to
decide
it
bearing
in
mind
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
from
the
bench.
and
do
you
think
you
could
do
that
for
15
days,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
if
you
will
do
that
then
and
counsel
for
the
petitioners
may
have
15
days
to
reply.
