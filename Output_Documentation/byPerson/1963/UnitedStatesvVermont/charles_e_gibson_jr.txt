mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
in
essence
what
the,
united
states
is
trying
to
do
here
is
to
take
two
identical
tax
liens
out
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
that
of
the
united
states
and
apply
a
different
standard
to
them.
united
states
has
claimed
that
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
involving
insolvency
should
be
treated
the
same
as
solvency
cases,
and
the
united
states
is
trying
to
justify
a
double
standard
for
policy
reasons
saying
that
the
needs
of
the
federal
revenue
are
paramount
here
and
in
their
brief
they
have
indicated
some
need
for
uniformity.
now
the
state
of
vermont
takes
the
viewpoint
that
there
is
nothing
here
which
requires
a
different
treatment
of
the
two
types
of
liens
that
the
cases
do
not
require
a
different
treatment
and
indicate
that
they
ought
to
be
treated
the
same
although
there
is
no
case
directly
in
point.
we
further
claim
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
and
that
non-insolvency
and
insolvency
matters
should
be
distinguished
because
of
difference
in
statutory
language
and
we
also
cannot
see
any
justification
on
policy
reasons
for
treating
solvency
and
insolvency
matters
the
same.
we
think
the
correct
principle
to
apply
here
is
that
which
was
applied
in
the
city
of
new
britain
and
which
was
enunciated
many
years
ago
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
rankin
versus
scott,
that
of
first
in
time,
first
in
write,
that
even
in
olden
days
was
considered
a
universal
principle.
it
should
be
fair
to
all
concerned,
easily
applicable,
and
universal.
we
don't
think
the
strict
choateness
test
which
this
court
has
developed
in
the
insolvency
cases
should
be
applied
in
cases
where
no
insolvency
is
involved
or
â€“
and
in
particular,
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
case.
in
fact,
we
don't
think
the
choateness
test
need
be
applied
at
all
but
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
it
in
the
light
of
choateness,
that
we
think
that
under
the
circumstances
here
were
as
choate
as
the
federal
government
as
the
court
indicated
in
new
britain
and
then
we
certainly
have
satisfied
enough
requirements
here,
so
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
we
should
prevail.
now,
the
state
has
first
and
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
here
we
assessed
our
tax
first,
we
filed
a
notice
of
tax
lien
with
a
proper
recording
office
first.
we
brought
suit
to
enforce
our
lien
first.
i'm
not
aware
that
the
united
states
filed
any
notice
of
levy
on
the
bank.
as
far
as
i
know
from
the
record
i
think
they
filed
a
notice
of
--
they
filed
a
demand
on
the
tax
payer
on
february
10th,
but
i'm
not
aware
that
there
was
ever
a
notice
of
levy
on
the
bank,
but
not
--
that's
particular
important,
but
that
statement
was
made.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
our
lien
as
of
the
date
of
assessment.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
assessment
and
demand
under
our
statute
which
was
october
21,
1958.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
yes.
our
income
tax
from
the
filing
provisions
were
and
lien
statutes
were
copied
after
the
federal
income
and
tax
provisions.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
assessment
and
demand
was
made
and
then
we
filed
a
notice
of
lien
with
our
recording
office
which
in
vermont
is
your
town
clerk
and
then
eventually
we
filed
suit
in
this
case
although
our
statute
provides
for
other
methods
of
enforcement.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
that
was
in
may
21,
1958.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
yes
four
days
later,
which
was
after
the
date
that
the
federal
lien
aroused
as
far
as
assessment
and
demand.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
yes,
we
claim
that
this
doesn't
depend
on
the
time
when
a
garnishee,
in
vermont
we
call
the
trustee
process
was
issued
against
the
bank
but
that
question
is
whether
our
lien
being
first
in
time
and
being
identical
with
federal
lien
should
prevail.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
well
security
trust
case
is
a
case
of
garnishee
case
now,
this
as
far
as
the
type
of
enforcement
that
the
state
chose
here
is
a
garnishee
case
in
a
way
and
yet
it
isn't
because
in
security
trust
the
private
party
was
being
sued
and
of
course
the
resort
to,
california
tried
to
resort
or
the
party
tried
to
resort
to
the
doctrine
of
relation
back
to
the
time
the
attachment
took
place
to
say
that
its
lien
took
effect
then
and
numerous
contingencies
in
the
language
of
the
court
could
arise
from
the
time
that
that
attachment
took
place
until
final
judgment.
in
other
words,
the
party
might
not
prevail
in
the
case
which
we
say
is
not
the
case
here
where
the
state
of
vermont
has
made
an
assessment
and
demand
on
it's
tax
for
taxes
and
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
taxpayer
has
filed
a
revolving
return
indicating
the
amount
due
and
it
was
after
that
was
done
that
the
state
brought
suit.
so
that
there
is
no
question
about
these
numerous
contingencies
arising
in
between
the
time
the
lien
took
effect
and
the
state
brought
suit,
which
--
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
well,
if
the
attaching,
in
security
trust
--
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
if
they
had
a,
if
the
attaching
party
acquired
judgment
of
what
prior
to
the
federal
lien
horizons,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
well
my
distinction
in
this
case
as
i
see
the
difference
in
the
cases
that
was
not
a
case
of
a
state
tax
lien.
it
was
a
case
of
a
private
party
bringing
suit
and
they
had
to
battle
it
out
in
the
lawsuit
to
see
who
is
going
to
win,
whether
anybody
won
or
did
not
win.
in
this
case
that
is
not
the
situation.
assessment
and
demand
was
made
by
the
state
of
vermont
on
the
basis
of
withholding
tax
return
filed
by
the
tax
payer,
so
there
is
no
question
to
what
the
state
of
vermont
was
owed
taxes
and
the
amount
was
certain
as
to
what
it
was
owed,
just
the
method
of
enforcement
was
the
only
thing
to
be
concerned
with
here
and
the
state
does
have
several
methods
of
enforcement.
we
can
foreclose
as
we
do
on
real-estate
or
chattel
mortgages,
or
under
title
32
v.s.a
6067
we
can
--
an
income
tax
matters
and
withholding
income,
is
a
income
tax
matter
of
course,
levy
on
personal
property
and
real
estate
and
so
forth.
so
that
although
the
state
did
not
enforce
this
by
levy
neither
did
the
united
states
and
of
course
if
somebody
--
the
possible
controversy
over
varying
interest
in
a
particular
piece
of
property,
i
think
probably
the
state
would
be
opt
to
and
does
go
to
court
does
this
with
their
own
government
and
rather
than
just
jump
in
with
a
levy.
there
was
some
question
in
this
particular
case
and
so
the
state
showed
this
method
of
enforcing
its
lien.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
i
didn't
get
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
campbell
is
an
insolvency
case
and
we
distinguish
in
our
brief
insolvency
cases
from
non-insolvency
cases.
in
first
place
the
statutes
are
different
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
you
have
a
statute
which
is
now
26
u.s.c
191
i
believe
it
is,
which
used
to
be
3466
which
clearly
gives
the
united
states
priority
in
insolvency
cases
and
the
cases
in
which
this
very
choateness
developed
were
in
insolvency
cases,
in
other
words
the
court
had
to
decide
were
this
broad
sweeping
statute
before
which
gives
the
united
states
a
priority
in
all
insolvency
matters.
the
court
had
to
decide
when
if
something
been
taken
from
a
tax
payer
so
that
this
priority
of
the
united
states
does
not
prevail
and
so
in
developing
the
rules
of
choateness
the
court
was
merely
withdrawing
step-by-step
trying
to
determine
when
anything
was
withdrawn
from
a
broad
sweep
of
the
federal
statute.
now,
there
is
no
federal
statute
like
this
in
tax
lien
cases,
the
federal
tax
lien
statute
merely
says
that
the
united
states
shall
have
a
lien
on
all
the
property
and
rights
to
property
and
it
says
when
that
arises,
but
that
statute
does
not
confer
priority
on
the
u.s
by
it's
terms,
there
is
no
expressed
priority
there
at
all.
and
therefore
we
say
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
give
the
united
states
priority
in
all
tax
matters
it
certainly
would
have
said
so.
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
this
tax
lien
statute
i
think
originated
in
1865
and
within
one
or
two
years
thereafter
congress
passed
bankruptcy
statute
and
it
gave
the
united
states
priority
in
bankruptcy
matters
as
to
it's
taxes
over
state
taxes
and
united
states
debts
over
state
debts
so
congress
knew
when
to
say
that
it
--
united
states
should
have
priority
and
when
not
to.
we
don't
think
--
and
i
think
the
--
no
policy
reasons
really
that
require
the
same
treatment
of
solvency
and
insolvency
matters.
the
government
points
to
the
need
for
--
the
paramount
needs
of
the
federal
revenue
and
federal
supremacy
and
so
forth
as
the
reason
of
treating
solvency
cases
the
same
as
insolvency
cases,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
is
so
because
if
the
taxpayer
is
insolvent,
united
states
is
going
prevail
under
section
191,
which
is
the
old
section
3466.
if
the
taxpayer
is
not
insolvent
then
everybody
ought
to
be
able
to
collect
its
fair
share
and
the
united
states
resources
are
much
broader
than
the
states.
it
can
go
outside
state
boundaries
whereas
the
state
of
vermont
is
going
to
be
limited
to
it's
own
boundaries
as
to
the
property
in
which
it
--
from
which
it
can
collect
the
tax.
so
that
actually
the
federal
revenues
are
not
going
to
be
frustrated
or
reported
by
treating
these
two
cases
the
same
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
think
that
it
would
be
arbitrarily
frustrating
the
state
and
the
collection
of
its
revenues
to
give
a
different
treatment
to
the
state
lien
which
is
identical
to
the
federal.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
case
exactly
in
point
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
except
we
claim
that
the
language
of
new
britain
is
in
our
favor
and
united
states
claims
of
course
is
in
their
favor.
some
--
there
are
couple
of
bankruptcy
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
which
have
--
for
now
the
federal
taxes
and
the
state
taxes
are
treated
equally
since
1898
and
they
have
held
as
the
second
circuit
court
that
in
these
circumstances
choateness
test
of
the
3466
the
ordinary
insolvency
case
didn't
apply
and
they
applied
first
in
time
first
in
right,
but
i
don't
think
there
was
a
question
of
the
identical
type
of
tax
payment
we
have
here.
the
--
apparently
the
rules
for
choateness
which
the
court
has
developed
as
a
fear
that
as
its
been
expressed
in
new
britain
and
some
of
the
other
cases
that
the
various
municipalities
and
states
can
put
a
lien
into
effect
just
by
statute
at
some
arbitrary
time
in
the
past
so
that
even
before
the
amount
is
determined
or
certain
and
that
is
not
a
problem
here,
because
there
the
amount
is
certain
and
i
don't
think
that
if
the
two
liens
are
the
same
that
there
is
any
need
to
fear
that
the
state
lien
is
arbitrary
if
the
state
lien
is
identical
to
federal
lien,
like
i
don't
see
how
these
government
can
say
it's
arbitrary
unless
they
say
their
lien
is
arbitrary.
and
to
say
that
theirs
is
presumed
to
be
perfected
when
the
states
--
when
there
is
noting
in
any
statute
indicate
that
and
say
the
states
isn't
again
its
justifying
an
unjustifiable
double
standard
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
amount
of
liability
is
determined.
now
if
the
state
tried
to
have
a
tax
lien
take
effect
at
some
date
prior
to
a
liability
there
is
some
time
prior
to
the
amount
was
certain
or
amount
was
due
or
at
the
beginning
of
a
year
or
something
like
that
then
i
think
that
the
court
could
and
might
well
say
well,
this
is
arbitrary
but
i
think
in
this
kind
of
case
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
question
of
whether
arbitrary
rather
than
applying
these
specific
rules
of
choatness
which
were
developed
in
the
insolvency
cases
which
we
don't
think
are
applicable
here.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
well
i
don't
want
to
actually
spare
any
time
arguing
this
particular
point
here.
i
raise
it
in
my
brief
but
with
the
30
minutes
i
didn't
want
to
take
any
time
on
it.
i
think
that
the
court
should
apply
to
state
law
but
i
really
don't
want
to
press
that
point
as
far
as
oral
argument
is
concerned,
because
i'm
--
the
court
is
tending
in
a
direction
of
applying
state
law
and
more
and
more
instances
in
these
matters
but
i
would
rather
in
the
short
time
i
have
stress
the
other
points.
mr.
charles
e.
gibson,
jr.
but
i
think
so
that
if
once
you
say
--
i
mean
i
would
say
that
the
state
law
should
be
determined
but
then
if
you
don't
do
that
then
if
you
are
applying
federal
law
then
look
at
this
case
here
we
have
identical
liens
and
is
a
state
lien
arbitrary
to
take
effect
at
some
arbitrary
time
is
what
should
be
applied.
now
the
--
as
we've
indicated
the
statutes
indicate
that
the
that
congress
knew
how
to
give
the
united
states
priority
when
it
wanted
to
in
the
bankruptcy
cases
it
did
so
in
a
distillers
tax
back
in
the
1860s
also
and
then
expressly
gave
the
united
states
priority.
the
court
has
at
times
talked
about
choatness
in
various
cases
like
pioneer
american
insurance
and
the
mechanics
liens,
well
the
court
didn't
talk
about
anything
in
mechanics
lien,
because
of
reversed
merely
but
again
all
these
type
of
cases
are
between
private
parties
where
these
numerous
contingencies
could
arise
between
bring
of
suit
or
the
date
of
the
lien
and
final
judgment,
which
is
not
the
case
here.
finally,
we
should
say
that
double
standard
we
think
is
unjustified
because
the
state
needs
are
just
as
great
as
united
states
these
days
and
in
terms
of
revenue
the
state
and
local
municipalities
are
certainly
in
great
need
of
their
funds.
the
united
states
has
much
broader
resources,
the
state
is
limited
to
state
boundary
whereas
the
united
states
can
go
anywhere
outside
of
the
state
as
far
as
collecting
and
effectuating
its
--
the
collection
of
it's
taxes
and
that
again
when
you
have
a
non-insolvency
matter
there
should
be
no
problem
for
the
united
states
to
collect,
the
state
may
have
a
problem
because
it
can't
go
out
of
it's
boundaries
but
the
united
states
can
go
if
there
is
some
property
outside
the
state
and
if
it's
an
insolvency
matter
the
united
states
undoubtedly
will
prevail
anyway.
and
in
terms
of
uniformity,
if
the
court
applies
rule
of
arbitrariness
then
we
think
that
the
need
for
uniformity
would
be
satisfied
and
that
all
lien
owers
within
any
particular
jurisdiction
or
state
ought
to
be
treated
equally
and
that
includes
the
united
states
and
the
various
competing
municipalities
of
states.
