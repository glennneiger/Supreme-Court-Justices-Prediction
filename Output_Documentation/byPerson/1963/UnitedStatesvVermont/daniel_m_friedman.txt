mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
lien
case,
here
on
the
writ
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
which
a
tax
lien
of
the
state
of
vermont
has
been
given
priority
over
a
federal
tax
lien.
the
question
presented
is
whether
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
arose,
the
general
lien
of
the
state
of
vermont
was
not
then
sufficiently
perfected
or
as
the
phrase
is
used
choate
because
it
had
not
attached
at
that
time
to
specific
property
of
the
taxpayer
so
that
federal
lien
although
arising
later
took
priority
over
the
earlier
state
general
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
mr.
justice
we
think
that
what
--
first
of
my
argument
will
be
that
the
federal
lien
is
presumed
to
be
fully
perfected
and
choate
the
minute
it
arises,
but
that
the
state
lien
in
order
to
prevail
against
the
federal
lien
must
meet
three
criteria
of
choateness
which
this
court
has
developed
and
we
think
consistently
applied,
and
which
we
think
this
lien
did
not
meet
because
it
did
not
attach
to
specific
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
we
think
if
i
may
say
mr.
justice
at
first
glance
it
might
seem
somewhat
anomalous
that
you
have
two
liens
which
are
in
substantially
identical
terms,
we
say
one
is
sufficiently
perfected,
the
other
isn't.
we
think
this
basically,
basically
rests
on
the
whole
policy
which
underlines
choate
lien
doctrine,
the
need
to
protect
federal
revenues
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
gainy
as
i
shall
--that's
our
basic
position
in
the
case.
the
facts
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
of
course
the
states
do
have
need
for
revenue
mr.
justice
but
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
the
federal
power
and
the
federal
interest
is
paramount
and
if
i
may
just
say
that
the
whole
thrust
of
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
dealt
with
this
problem
we
think
have
recognized
that
a
state
lien,
state
created
liens
and
the
federal
liens
do
have
different
standards
and
different
tests
applied.
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
are
very
simple,
not
in
dispute.
the
taxpayer
is
a
firm
named
cutting
&
trimming
and
the
dispute
between
us
and
the
state
of
vermont
is
over
some
$1800
which
the
taxpayer
had
on
deposit
in
a
bank
in
vermont.
the
state
of
vermont
has
an
income
tax
system
which
is
patterned
on
and
is
very
similar
to
the
federal
income
tax
system,
was
done
explicitly
in
fact.
one
of
its
provisions
is
the
requirement
similar
to
the
federal
system
that
an
employer
withhold
taxes
on
his
employees'
wages.
and
the
vermont
statute
provides
that
in
the
event
an
employer
fails
to
withhold
and
pay
over
the
tax
to
the
state,
the
amount
of
the
tax
shall
be
a
lien
upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer
arising
upon
the
assessment
of
the
tax
and
demand
and
again
this
is
basically
the
same
provision
as
the
federal
provision.
the
dates
with
respect
to
the
assessment
and
the
perfection
of
these
liens
are
as
follows.
the
state
of
vermont's
lien
arose
first.
it
aroused
on
october
28th,
--
sorry
october
21st,
1958
and
that
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
the
cutting
&
trimming
firm
had
filed
a
tax
return
for
the
third
quarter
of
1958
filling
a
substantial
indebtednesses
to
the
state
in
withholding
taxes
that
it
failed
to
pay
those
taxes.
so
the
state
on
the
21st
of
the
october
assessed
the
taxes
and
made
a
demand
and
under
state
law
its
lien
arose
at
that
point.
seven
months
later
on
the
21st
of
may
1959,
the
state
of
vermont
took
its
next
step
toward
enforcing
its
lien
when
it
brought
a
suit
in
the
state
court
against
cutting
&
trimming
and
the
bank
in
which
the
cutting
&
trimming
had
funds
on
deposit
and
four
days
later
after
the
seven
months
it
served
a
writ
of
attachment
on
the
bank
and
i
just
may
interpolate
to
say
in
the
government's
view
at
that
point,
and
at
that
point
only
that
the
lien
of
the
state
of
vermont
acquired
a
sufficient
degree
of
perfection
that
it
would
come
ahead
of
the
federal
lien.
but
the
federal
lien
had
arisen
in
the
interval
about
three-and-a-half
months
later,
i
mean,
three-and-a-half
months
after
the
state
lien
has
arisen.
in
february
1959,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
assessed
against
cutting
&
trimming
taxes
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
this
is
a
statute
which
requires
an
employer
to
pay
a
tax
of
3%
of
his
payroll.
unlike
the
state
tax
which
was
due
quarterly
this
tax
is
due
annually
on
the
31st
day
of
january
for
the
preceding
year.
the
government
in
turn,
a
few
days
thereafter,
also
served
a
notice
of
levy
upon
the
bank
and
this
suit
was
instituted
approximately
two
years
after
we
had
filed
our
notice
of
levy.
now
before
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
just
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
a
contention
of
the
state
of
vermont
that
the
answer
to
this
question
whether
the
state
lien
outranks
the
federal
lien
should
be
decided
not
by
federal
law
but
by
state
law.
the
state
recognizes
as
indeed
it
must
that
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
federal
and
not
state
law
governs
the
relative
priority
of
state
and
federal
liens.
it
urges,
however,
that
despite
the
settled
opinion
that
the
court
should
reexamine
this
position
and
reach
the
contrary
conclusion.
we
strongly
urge
that
the
settled
rule
is
the
correct
rule
and
that
the
rule
should
be
followed.
we
have
developed
the
argument
in
our
brief,
i
won't
labor
it
here,
but
just
like
to
indicate
briefly
why
we
think
this
is
the
correct
rule.
the
federal
liens
of
course
are
created
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
power
to
levy
and
collect
taxes,
their
scope
and
reach
widely
affect
federal
revenues,
their
interpretation
is
important
to
the
policy
underlying
the
lien
statute,
and
we
therefore
think
it
is
the
federal
law
and
not
the
state
law
that
one
must
look
in
determining
these
questions.
now,
a
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
state
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
brosnan
case,
a
few
terms
ago,
points
towards
that
that
indicates
it
is
appropriate
here
to
look
to
state
law.
in
the
brosnan
case
this
court
said
that
in
determining
the
propriety
of
procedures
by
which
a
state
discharged
a
junior
lien
federal
law
was
governing
but
the
federal
law
the
court
would
adopt
would
be
the
state
procedure.
we
think
that
the
basic
rationale
of
that
decision
is
inapplicable
here.
the
court
was
concerned
because
of
relationship
between
federal
liens
and
private
liens,
that
to
apply
a
state
law
--
to
apply
the
federal
law
would
result
in
disruption
of
well
settled
property
interest
and
property
principal,
it
was
appropriate
to
defer.
there
is
not
that
policy
involved
here.
here
what
we
have
is
a
basic
conflict
between
the
state
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
government
on
the
other
and
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
question
as
to
the
procedures
which
was
all
that
was
involved
in
brosnan,
the
procedures
for
discharging
liens
but
substantive
question
has
been
priority
and
we
therefore
think
that
that
isn't
the
matter
to
which
federal
law
control.
i
now
like
to
come
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
we
start
i
think
fairly
with
a
well
settled
proposition
which
this
court
has
repeated
many
times
and
we
asserted
only
last
term
in
the
pioneer
case
which
is
that
before
a
state
created
lien
can
take
priority
over
a
federal
lien,
it
must
be
a
perfected
and
choate
lien
and
the
choate
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
apparently
the
opposite
of
inchoate,
that's
all
i
can
say
and
it's
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
it
first
came
in
the
spokane
in
which
this
court
quoted
from
a
statement
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
washington
in
which
they
said
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
it's
an
old
word,
it
may
even
go
back
to
some
of
the
old
cases?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
it's
a
--
that's
a
word
that
finds
its
presence
lot
during
the
opinions
of
this
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perfected,
yes
that
the
lien
--
in
effect
nothing
more
remains
to
be
done,
then
it
has
a
fully
perfected
lien.
it's
just
a
short
hand
phrase
i
think,
but
i
think
the
meaning
of
it
is
brought
out
in
the
standards
which
the
court
has
applied
in
determining
whether
a
lien
is
perfected.
the
court
has
said
many
times
that
before
a
state
created
lien
is
sufficiently
perfected,
so
that
it
finds
an
earlier
arising
federal
lien,
three
conditions
must
be
satisfied.
first
the
identity
of
the
lienor
must
be
known,
first
the
identity
of
the
lienor.
second
the
amount
of
the
lien
must
be
known
and
third
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
must
be
attached.
now,
this
doctrine
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
well
we
think
mr.
justice
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
the
third
criteria,
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
is
not
satisfied
here
by
the
state's
lien,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
was
developed,
which
were
the
cases
under
the
so
called
federal
insolvency
statute,
section
3466
of
the
revised
statutes.
that
is
the
provision
that
provides
that
in
the
event
of
insolvency
debts
due
to
the
united
states
shall
be
first
satisfied.
a
series
of
cases
arose
in
which
the
question
was
whether
the
federal
insolvency
priority
prevails
over
a
perfected
state
lien
and
in
five
cases
decided
between
1929
and
1946,
this
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
question
where
you
had
a
general
state
statute,
because
they
said
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
because
this
general
state
statute
on
all
of
the
property
of
the
tax
payer
is
not
a
perfected
choate
lien
which
might
present
this
problem.
the
last
case
of
that
group
was
a
case
called
illinois
against
campbell
in
329
u.s.
1946
and
in
that
case
for
the
first
time
the
court
weaving
together
the
strands
of
its
prior
decisions
specified
the
three
criteria
to
which
i
have
referred,
it
listed
them
by
number
one,
two
and
three;
the
identity
of
the
lienor,
the
amount
of
the
lien
and
third
the
property
to
which
the
lien
attaches
and
it
then
went
on
to
particularize
what
it
meant
by
the
property
to
which
the
lien
attaches.
it
said
and
i
quote
“the
lien
must
attach
to
specific
property
of
the
debtor.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
enough
that
you
had
a
lien
in
that
case
on
all
the
personal
property
of
the
debtor
used
in
the
conduct
of
his
business.
it
had
to
be
something
more
than
that.
it
had
to
attach
to
the
specific
property
to
attach.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
will
depend
on
the
particular
type
of
thing.
we
think
in
this
case
it
was
satisfied
when
they
actually
attached
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
bank.
now
i
think
it's
significant
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
attaching
to
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
--
i
think
mr.
justice
if
the
statute
spoke
in
terms
of
all
property
of
the
tax
payer
and
it
just
so
happened
that
the
tax
payer
only
had
one
piece
of
property
i
would
think
something
further
was
required
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
has
to
do
something
more
than
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
be
an
attachment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
levy
perhaps.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
maybe,
it
maybe
in
the
case
of
real
property
the
obtaining
of
a
judgment
and
the
filing
of
the
judgment
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
we
can
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
regularly
seize
property,
but
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
new
britain
makes
it
clear
that
the
federal
lien
even
though
we
have
not
taken
any
steps
is
treated
as
a
perfected
lien
from
the
moment
it
arises
and
is
a
different
situation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
have
always
acknowledged
the
priority
of
a
mortgage
as
against
a
--
it
could
actually
be
recorded,
we
have
the
other
provisions.
but
we
concede
that
a
mortgage
is
a
perfected
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
i'm
just
saying
that
the
recording
is
necessary
only
for
our
federal
lien
to
prevail
against
the
mortgage
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
if
--
yes
because
once
the
liens
are
of
equal
dignity,
once
the
liens
of
equal
degree
of
perfection
we
think
as
new
britain
indicates,
the
rule
is
the
first
in
right
--
is
first
in
time
is
the
first
in
right,
but
we
think
that
before
that
rule
comes
into
play
the
state
lien
does
have
to
meet
these
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
say
for
the
earlier
federal
--
if
the
federal
lien
arises
first,
it
prevails
against
the
mortgage,
conversely
if
the
mortgages
arises
first
it
takes
precedence
over
the
federal
because
it
is
a
perfected
lien,
it's
attached
to
specific
property,
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
debt
is
settled
and
the
identity
of
the
lienor
is
known.
we
think
that
particular
security
interest
does
meet
these
three
criteria.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
identity
of
the
lienor
must
be
established.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
question
about
that.
the
amount
of
the
lien
must
be
established,
no
question
about
that
here.
the
lien
must
attach
to
specific
property,
we
deny
if
that
that's
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
must
attach.
the
identity
of
the
property
must
be
established,
but
we
suggest
that
the
way
the
identity
of
the
property
must
be
established,
the
way
that
is
shown
under
the
campbell
case
is
that
the
lien
must
attach
to
the
specific
property,
must
single
out
property
and
attach
to
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so
mr.
justice
and
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
illinois
against
campbell
in
329
u.s.
now
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
formulation
of
the
rule
in
illinois
against
campbell
in
terms
of
these
three
conditions
was
carried
over
by
this
court
into
the
cases
under
the
lien
statute,
that
is
in
the
opinions
in
the
both
new
britain
and
pioneer
the
court
again
repeated
the
three
criteria.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
in
new
britain,
as
we
read
new
britain,
we
think
the
touchstone
of
the
decision
there,
the
reason
why
some
of
the
state
liens
were
deemed
perfected
is
because
they
attached
to
specific
property.
the
court
repeatedly
said
that
those
liens
attached
to
specific
property.
there
you
had
contest
between
the
federal
general
lien
and
specific
liens
of
the
city
of
new
britain
and
the
court
said
that
the
fact
that
the
liens
of
the
city
of
new
britain
was
specific
didn't
give
them
any
priority
over
the
federal
government,
any
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
ones
that
one
where
the
ones
that
had
become
perfected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
attaching
to
specific
property
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what?
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
were
lien
on
the
particular
property,
it
was
real
estate
lien
or
lien
for
what
attaches
which
related
only
to
the
particular
piece
of
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
that
was
all
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
i
think
mr.
justice
that's
all
that's
necessary
when
you
are
dealing
with
liens
on
real
property.
there
is
nothing
more
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
personal
property
which
is
in
mass
something
more
is
needed
and
always
the
liens
on
real
property
by
definition
is
a
particular
lien
relating
only
to
the
particular
piece
of
property,
whereas
a
lien
when
you
are
dealing
with
personality
it's
a
general
lien
that
has
to
go
on
something
more.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice,
as
far
as
real
property
--
if
the
lien
is
on
all
property,
if
the
lien
is
on
all
property
the
tax
payer,
i
think
something
more
is
required,
if
it
was
a
real
estate
lien,
a
lien
for
real
estate
taxes,
which
attached
to
only
the
particular
piece
of
property,
then
i
would
say
at
that
point
this
was
a
fully
perfected
lien.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
quite
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact
yes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
as
we
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
the
only
issue
in
the
case
and
we
say
that
the
government
lien
by
its
very
nature
is
perfected
when
it
arises.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
on
this.
first
of
all
let
me
just
start
by
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
friendly
for
the
unanimous
court
below
expressly
recognized
that
if
this
case
had
arisen
under
the
insolvency
statute
under
section
3466,
under
the
illinois
v.
campbell
decision
our
lien
would
come
ahead
of
the
state's
lien.
he
suggested,
however,
that
the
rule
is
otherwise
when
the
government's
priority
is
asserted
not
under
the
insolvency
statute
but
under
the
federal
lien
law.
now
this
it
seems
to
us
is
a
wrong
result
for
at
least
two
reasons,
three
reasons.
first
the
basic
policy
underlying
the
two
statutes
seems
to
us
is
the
same,
both
the
grant
of
priority
and
insolvency
to
the
government
and
the
creation
of
liens
to
the
government
for
its
taxes
are
designed
to
accomplish
the
collection
of
the
debts
due
to
the
government.
and
in
the
light
of
this
it
seems
to
us
most
peculiar
to
say
that
in
the
one
case
the
government's
lien
is
good
enough,
the
government's
claim
is
good
enough
as
against
the
state
lien;
in
the
other
case
it
isn't.
indeed
it
seems
to
us
most
unusual
to
say
that
in
this
situation
the
government
would
prevail
if
all
it
had
was
an
unsecured
claim
for
a
debt
based
upon
the
insolvency
priority,
but
that
the
government
loses
when
it
has
the
higher
claim
of
a
lien
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
you
don't
have
an
explicit
term
but
this
court
i
think
in
the
security
trust
case
has
recognized
that
if
the
–
if
i
may
just
quote
two
sentences
mr.
justice
from
what
the
court
said
in
the
security
trust
case
in
340
united
states,
we
have
set
forth
a
quotation
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
that's
the
case
in
which
for
the
first
time
the
court
applied
under
the
tax
lien
statute
the
principles
of
choateness
and
perfection
which
it
had
developed
previously
under
section
3466.
and
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
‘in
cases
involving
a
kindred
matter,
i.e.,
the
federal
priority
under
r.s.
3466,
it
has
never
been
held
sufficient
to
defeat
the
federal
priority
merely
to
show
a
lien
effective
to
protect
the
lienor
against
others
than
the
government,
but
contingent
upon
taking
subsequent
steps
to
enforce
it,'
citing
illinois
v.
campbell.”
“if
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tax
lien
statute
to
insure
prompt
and
certain
collection
of
taxes
due
the
united
states
from
tax
delinquents
is
to
be
fulfilled,
a
similar
rule
must
prevail
here.”
now
following
that
decision
in
both
new
britain
and
in
pioneer,
the
court
again
reiterated
these
three
criteria.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
--
what
the
court
said
in
new
britain
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
contentions
made
to
it
and
the
argument
that
the
city
made
in
new
britain
was
because
the
city's
lien
was
specific
and
the
federal
lien
was
general
that
the
city's
lien
prevailed
over
the
federal
lien
and
i
think
it's
in
that
context
that
the
court
made
this
statement
at
page
84
that
the
federal
liens
are
general
and
in
the
sense
above
perfected
that
is
that
nothing
more
need
to
be
done
to
have
a
choate
lien
perfected.
now
that
i
think
--
i
think
new
britain,
well
new
britain
held
only
that
the
specific
lien
was
good,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
recognition,
it's
a
recognition
by
the
court
that
in
order
to
reach
the
degree
of
perfection
as
against
the
federal
lien
to
bring
in
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right
rule
it
is
necessary
that
the
city,
the
local
lien
be
attached
to
specific
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
being
so
that
--
well,
that
being
so
it
is
a
choate
and
perfected
lien.
the
--
for
example
the
court
said
in
new
britain
the
priority
of
each
statutory
lien
contested
here
must
depend
on
the
time
it
attached
to
the
property
in
question
and
became
choate
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
state
is
correct
here
and
that
this
general
lien
satisfies
the
standard
of
choateness
which
it
must
in
order
to
prevail
against
the
federal
lien,
we
think
as
a
practical
matter,
the
third
condition
of
attachment
to
specific
property
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
as
the
basis
for
choate
liens
disappears
because
liens
basically
are
of
two
types.
they
are
either
a
lien
on
specific
property
that
is
for
example
a
lien
on
real
estate,
the
lien
an
innkeeper
has
on
luggage,
the
lien
a
lawyer
has
on
his
papers
are
general
liens.
now
if
in
fact
a
general
lien
on
all
the
property
of
the
taxpayers
satisfies
the
standard
of
choateness
then
it
seems
to
me
every
lien,
every
lien
by
definition
will
necessarily
meet
the
requirement
of
the
attachment
to
specific
property
and
that
to
us,
seems
to
me,
eliminates
the
third
condition
and
yet
this
court
repeatedly
has
stressed
that
the
three
conditions
have
to
be
met
before
the
state
created
lien
can
prevail
over
the
federal
lien.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
there
are
just
two
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
rebuttal.
first
in
terms
of
the
basic
policy
which
both
the
solvency
statute
and
the
lien
statute
serve
as
this
court
has
indicated
protecting
federal
revenues
and
helping
the
federal
government
in
collecting
revenues
it
needs,
the
need
is
just
as
great
whether
the
tax
payer
is
solvent
or
insolvent.
secondly
in
terms
of
the
state's
contention
that
there
is
a
fundamental
unfairness
here
in
applying
a
double
standard,
now
the
point
i'm
going
to
make
is
admittedly
not
dispositive,
but
we
think
--
look
at
in
terms
of
this
case
and
this
is
the
case
which
the
court
has
to
decide
we
think
this
is
a
significant
test.
if
the
state,
when
the
state's
lien
came
on
in
october,
there
was
approximately
three
and
a
half
months
between
the
time
when
the
state's
lien
arose
and
when
the
federal
lien
arose
on
the
assessment
of
the
taxes.
during
that
period
the
state
had
ample
opportunity
to
take
any
steps
to
perfect
its
lien,
had
it
done
so
admittedly
its
lien
would
prime
the
federal
lien,
conversely
the
federal
payroll
tax
which
covered
part
of
the
same
period
as
the
state's
tax
did
not
become
due
until
the
end
of
the
following
year
in
january,
january
31st,
the
federal
lien
arose
on
the
6th
of
february.
if
the
state
as
i
say
had
moved
promptly
and
reduced
it's
lien
to
judgment
taken
the
steps
which
this
court
has
indicated
necessary
for
a
perfected
lien,
the
state
would
have
prevailed
over
the
federal
government.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
state's
lien
upon
its
arising
as
a
choate
lien
there
was
no
possible
way
in
which
the
federal
government
could
protect
its
need
for
collection
by
doing
anything
because
automatically
even
though
the
state
have
taken
no
further
steps.
now,
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
some
of
the
old
cases
involving
the
insolvency
case
have
dealt
with
similar
situations
where
the
timing
of
the
state
statute
is
such
that
unless
you
have
a
doctrine
like
this
the
net
effect
is
that
the
state
always
prevails
over
the
federal
government.
we
are
not
saying
it's
dispositive
of
course,
we
do
think
there
is
a
persuasive
consideration
to
indicate
why
the
choate
lien
doctrine
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
applied
and
which
sometimes
involves
primarily
the
question
of
whether
the
amount
of
the
lien
is
satisfied.
in
the
case
of
security
trust
case,
you
didn't
know
how
much
of
it's
going
to
be,
in
this
case
you
don't
know
what
property
attaches
to
it.
we
think
the
same
principle
is
applicable
in
both
situations
and
we
therefore
think
that
this
lien
like
so
many
other
state
created
liens
which
has
been
held
not
upon
federal
lien
but
similarly
(inaudible)
into
it.
thank
you.
