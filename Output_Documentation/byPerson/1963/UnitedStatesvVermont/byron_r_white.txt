justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
mean
reduce
the
debt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
really
had
requested
to
identifying
the
property
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
the
fellow
has
only
one
piece
--
owns
only
one
piece
of
property
and
everybody
admits
it,
there
is
not
question
that
what
property
of
lien
is
going
to
relate
to
isn't
it,
no
question
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
--
you
do
not
need
identification
of
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
an
actual
what
you
call
an
attachment?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
personal
property
is
actually
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
seizure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
it
that
you
think
that
the
federal
government,
the
federal
lien
isn't
subject
to
the
same
requirement,
because
you
have
other
remedies
to
perfect
your
own
lien,
you
couldn't
go
and
have
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
do
regularly
to
seize
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
lien,
the
federal
lien
under
the
new
britain
is
that
--
even
against
mortgages
where
there
is
a
--
would
you
say
a
mortgage
is
under
local
law
is
a
more
perfected
lien?
you
say
that
--
do
you
think
mortgage
is
a
choate
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think
that
recording
the
federal
lien
adds
some
choateness
that
don't
have
the
full
recording?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
terms
of
choateness
say
federal
lien,
if
it's
recorded
--
i
mean
a
federal
lien
when
it
arises,
is
choate
enough
to
prevail
even
against
say
later
state
choate
lien
in
the
form
of
a
mortgage.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
if
the
federal
lien
a
fortiori
ought
to
prevail
against
an
unfiled
or
an
inchoate
state
lien
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
would
prevail
against
the
mortgage
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
--
and
what
do
you
think
the
test
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
question
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
say
that
the
third
provision
is
--
the
property
must
be
specifically
identified
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
think
that
something
beyond
this
identification
in
those
three
--
the
way
this
court
has
stated
those
three
requirements,
there
is
something
beyond
just
identification.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
case
do
you
think
this
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
repeated
the
three
criteria,
but
none
of
these
cases
indicated
that
there
was
any
dimension
in
that
third
requirement
other
than
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
liens
in
new
britain,
which
state
liens,
some
state
liens
one
in
new
britain
and
some
state
liens
in
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
one
is
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
how?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly,
but
they
did
nothing
else,
other
than
a
statutory
lien
which
as
of
a
certain
day
attached
to
a
specific
piece
of
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
after
identification
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
the
states
of
no
act
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
to
make
the
difference
and
if
the
fellows
only
owned
one
piece
of
personal
property
or
one
piece
of
real
property
you
would
have
to
--
would
that
make
any
difference?
