justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
quoted
in
--
can
we
find
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
amendment
i'm
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
for
them
to
tell
that
whether
some
of
this
electric
power
came
from
hoover
and
from
davis?
how
can
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
knew
the
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
all
get
mixed
up
like
drops
of
water
that
go
to
the
sea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
it
been
proved
that
it
doesn't
mix?
it
could
all
get
together
and
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
mix
somewhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
--
do
you
mean
that
they
have
different
lines
that
it
runs
through?
justice
hugo
l.
black
runs
through
the
same
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
at
some
point,
this
power
that
comes
from
hoover
dam
gets
in
the
pipe
with
power
that
didn't
come
from
hoover
dam,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
on
the
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
now,
was
there
any
evidence
here
that
it
is
possible,
maybe
it
is
in
the
age
of
electronics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
that
--
have
they
found
any
way
yet
to
divide
these
electrons
up
and
look
through
and
see
which
ones
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
flow
to
the
end
and
which
ones
stop
on
the
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
possible
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
possible
if
you
have
a
stream
that
has
a
number
of
streams
coming
into
it
and
somewhere,
that
stream
stops
flowing
so
that
you,
then,
pick
it
up
again
later,
new
water
comes
in
you'd
know
it.
but
how
are
you
going
to
divide
those
drops
of
water
or
electrons
when
they
get
together
in
a
line
or
get
--
both
of
them
get
in
one
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
doesn't
impose
impossible
burden
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
either
side,
and
i
--
unless
there's
some
evidence,
someway,
in
here
that
there's
a
better
way
to
discover
or
find
out
whether
the
particular
electrons
that
were
generated
at
hoover
didn't
go
to
colton.
if
they
had
--
somewhere
along
the
line,
got
in
along
with
some
that
did,
i
should
think
that
we
would
have
to
assume
that
the
commission
is
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
maybe
it's
one
of
those
things,
i
could
say,
there's
a
burden
on
somebody
to
show
that
lightning
flashes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
everybody
knows
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
flashes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
it's
a
--
it's
as
much
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
is
if
water
that
gets
mixed
up,
its
drops
gets
mixed
up
and
it
keeps
on
flowing,
that
there's
a
very
difficult
way
unless
you
analyze
all
the
drops
some
way
chemically.
it
is
impossible
to
tell
which
drop
goes
to
where.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
proof
that
it
goes
along
in
the
same
line,
isn't
it,
propelled
by
some
kind
of
force?
