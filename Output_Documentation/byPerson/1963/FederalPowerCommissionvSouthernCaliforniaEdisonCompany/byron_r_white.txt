well,
would
you
say
that
the
kansas
case
based
its
conclusion
on
the
fact
that
a
wholesale
sale
was
of
national
significance
rather
than
local
significance?
wasn't
that
the
rationale
of
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
case
the
attleboro
case
relied
upon,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
isn't
this
rather
a
unique
case,
rather
a
rare
burden
that
has
no
significance
to
any
other
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
general
your
proposition
is
i
suppose
that
--
well,
let's
assume
that
the
ultimate
source
here
of
the
power
was
not
with
the
federal
government
but
with
a
private
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
at
some
point
along
that
line,
and
probably
at
least
on
the
first
sale
by
that
company
in
an
interstate
transaction,
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
think
that's
the
first
and
last
time
that
it
should
regulate
the
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
in
all
subsequent
downstream
sales,
or
whatever
direction
you
people
talk
about,
and
once
it's
crossed
the
--
once
you
get
across
the
border
and
a
sale
occurs
there,
that
should
be
a
state
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
entire
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
what
if
--
where
there's
an
ultimate
consumption
within
the
state,
if
there
is
a
prior
regulated
sale,
regulated
by
the
federal
authority,
that
exhausts
all
the
national
interest
there
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
this
is
--
this
really
is
a
quite
general
applicability
then,
the
principle
that
you're
struggling
about
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wa
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
purchase
by
edison
directly
from
the
federal
government
or
was
the
water
district
in
between?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
who
paid
the
federal
government,
the
water
district
or
edison?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
