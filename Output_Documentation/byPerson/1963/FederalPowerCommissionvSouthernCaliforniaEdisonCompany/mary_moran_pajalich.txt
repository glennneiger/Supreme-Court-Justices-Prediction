ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
mary
pajalich,
representing
the
california
public
utilities
commission
which
speaks
for
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
in
matters
involving
public
utilities.
the
court
is
aware
that
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commissioners,
which
represents
other
state
commissions,
has
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
with
the
court
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
california
commission.
the
california
commission
your
honor,
subscribes
fully
to
the
legal
arguments
advanced
by
edison
with
regard
to
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
to
the
additional
reason
for
sustaining
it
under
the
boulder
canyon
legislation.
the
burden
of
the
federal
power
commission
argument
has
been
that
congress
has
given
it
jurisdiction
over
every
sale
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
i'd
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
practical
considerations
that
would
ensue
if
fpc
has
jurisdiction
of
all
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
i'm
assuming,
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
that
the
fpc
is
successful
in
proving
that
there
is
interstate
energy
in
this
--
in
all
wholesale
sales
as
they
were
not
able
to
do
in
the
colton
proceeding.
throughout
the
united
states
your
honors,
electric
companies
sell
energy
at
wholesale
or
resale
to
cooperatives,
shopping
centers,
office
buildings,
apartment
houses,
and
trailer
courts.
these
are
just
as
much
a
sale
at
wholesale
or
resale
as
is
the
sale
to
the
city
of
colton
or
to
any
other
municipality.
there
is
no
distinction
between
sales
and
wholesale
made
in
the
federal
power
act.
now,
the
agency
--
the
administrative
agency
which
has
jurisdiction
over
a
wholesale
sale
also
has
jurisdiction
over
the
service
performed
by
the
utility
which
makes
the
sale,
even
though
congress
exempted
from
fpc
jurisdiction
local
distribution
facilities
over
which
sales,
such
as
i
have
just
mentioned,
are
customarily
made.
if
the
fpc
has
jurisdiction,
it
must
entertain
complaints
relative
to
the
service
of
the
electric
companies
making
these
wholesale
sales.
and
there
are
several
hundred
thousand
customers
in
the
united
states
which
buy
energy
at
wholesale
from
the
electric
companies
for
resale
to
their
own
tenants.
the
federal
power
commission,
your
honors,
has
described
its
own
facilities
as
limited
facilities
in
the
gas
producer
cases,
and
the
area
rate
cases
were
its
effort
to
utilize
its
limited
facilities
in
the
most
effective
way.
if
fpc
has
jurisdiction
over
every
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
the
court
can
just
envision
the
difficulties
that
would
ensue
if
a
trailer
court
operator,
let's
say,
in
california
tries
to
get
a
little
expeditious
action
out
of
the
fpc
because
his
master
meter
is
running
too
fast
or
an
apartment
house
owner
who
says
he
has
a
disputed
bill.
what
chance
would
he
get,
with
fpc's
backlog
of
unconsidered
and
undisposed
of
cases
which
involved
multistate
concern
of
ever
getting
heard?
congress
never
could
have
intended
that
the
agency
that
it
created
to
deal
with
problems
of
national
concern
would
ever
try
to
handle
these
matters
which
the
states
can
handle
and
handle
expeditiously.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
sells
its
electric
power
at
retail
to
the
inhabitants
of
colton,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
not
always,
your
honor.
we
got
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no,
we
have
lots
of
complaints
from
tenants
of
an
apartment
house
who
say,
“i've
got
a
bill
from
x
utility
company
and
i
know
they're
billing
me
too
much.”
so,
more
or
less,
as
a
courtesy
to
the
complainants,
we
do
investigate
that
matter
in
california,
although
of
course,
the
proper
person
for
them
to
go
to
see
would
be
the
utility
but
we
have
jurisdiction
over
the
utility.
now,
there's
another
matter.
if
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
every
wholesale
sale
in
interstate
commerce,
it
would
be
inundated
by
the
filing
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
rate
schedules,
which
it
doesn't
have
to
cope
with
now,
for
resale
schedules
for
sales
to
coops,
apartment
house
owners,
retail,
shopping
centers,
and
so
on.
there
is
another
aspect
to
this,
too.
a
--
an
apartment
house
owner,
just
for
an
example,
who
sells
energy
at
wholesale,
and
let's
assume
it's
in
interstate
commerce,
the
rate
which
he
is
charged
by
the
utility
comes
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
but,
he
can
change
his
mind
over
night
and
say,
“i
don't
want
--i
don't
want
this
wholesale
sale
anymore.
i'm
going
to
just
buy
energy
at
retail
from
the
local
utility
and
i'll
recover
the
cost
of
the
electric
energy
that
i
buy
in
rates
to
my
tenants.
i
won't
sub-meter
to
them.”
then
that
becomes
a
retail
sale
then
the
jurisdiction
switches
back
to
the
state
commission.
the
sale
which
was
formally
under
fpc
jurisdiction
then
comes
under
the
california
commission.
now,
surely
congress
could
never
have
intended
that
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction
could
rise
and
fall
on
the
whim
of
an
apartment
house
manager.
then
there
is
the
matter
of
rates.
both
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
california
commission
fix
rates,
in
fixing
rates,
make
allocations
of
costs
and
revenues
and
expenses
between
interstate
and
intrastate
plant.
if
a
number
of
wholesale
customers
switched
from
wholesale
to
retail,
this
could
disrupt
the
allocations
made
by
each
agency.
we'd
never
know
whether
enough
plant
was
in
the
interstate
pot
or
in
the
intrastate
pot,
and
the
companies
might
not
earn.
there
might
be
a
gap
in
their
return
on
their
total
plant.
then
the
california
commission
fixes
rates
differently
from
the
federal
power
commission.
the
federal
power
commission
considers
the
costs,
makes
an
allocation
of
the
costs
between
users
of
the
system.
the
california
commission
considers
competition
by
competing
fuels,
such
as
mr.
spritzer
said,
natural
gas
or
oil.
it
considers
the
ability
of
a
customer
to
pay,
the
historical
rate
pattern,
and
the
impact
of
rates
on
development
of
an
industry
or
of
an
area.
now,
these
are
purely
local
considerations.
the
california
commission,
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
california
public
utilities
code,
has
an
unvarying
policy
of
fixing
resale
rates
to
cities
as
low
as
possible
without
burdening
other
customers.
so
the
rates
will
never
be
the
same.
if
they're
fixed
by
the
california
commission
or
the
fpc,
they
can't
be
the
same
and
there
can
be
no
duality
of
this
type
of
regulation.
this
switching
back
and
forth,
i
think,
is
illustrated
by
what
the
city
of
colton
did.
first,
it
paid
the
increased
rates
which
the
california
commission
authorized.
then
in
1961,
the
federal
power
commission
ordered
edison
to
file
as
its
schedule
its
1945
contract
with
the
city
of
colton.
and
thereafter,
colton
paid
edison
on
the
basis
of
those
16-year-old
extremely
low
rates.
then
edison
filed
its
schedule
of
rates
with
the
federal
power
commission
pursuant
to
the
federal
power
commission's
order,
calculated
or
--
calculated,
on
the
basis
of
federal
power
commission
practice,
the
allocation
of
cost
method.
these
rates
are
considerably
higher
than
the
rates
which
california
had
fixed
for
the
sale.
colton
paid
those
higher
rates
until
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
came
out.
then
that
being
the
last
word
out
of
the
judicial
hopper,
it
paid
california
rates
again,
they
being
lower.
if
customers
go
back
and
forth
like
this
between
jurisdictions,
neither
agency
could
ever
make
a
smooth
and
workable
rate
structure.
claims
of
discriminations
between
cities
and
between
customers
would
inevitably
arise.
electric
utilities
which
are
not
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
their
rates
fixed
by
the
california
commission
in
accordance
with
california
standards.
cities
would
get
a
break
in
that
fixing
of
the
rates.
other
cities
whose
rates
would
be
fixed
by
the
federal
power
commission
at
a
higher
level
would
inevitably
complain.
now,
the
american
public
power
association
says,
mr.
spritzer
repeated
their
language
today,
that
there
could
be
no
certainty
about
a
forum
unless
the
federal
power
commission
gets
the
regulation.
the
only
certainty,
absent
a
determination
of
flow
of
interstate
energy,
would
be
if
the
federal
power
commission
had
jurisdiction
over
all
wholesale
sales,
whether
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
intrastate
commerce,
but
congress
hasn't
given
them
that
jurisdiction.
another
difficulty
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
have,
a
very
practical
difficulty
if
it
gets
regulation
over
every
wholesale
sale
in
interstate
commerce,
is
to
trace
interstate
energy
into
that
interstate
sale.
and
the
federal
power
commission
would
find
it
mighty
burdensome
and
vexatious
to
try
to
trace
out-of-state
energy
through
distribution
facilities
which
serve
wholesale
customers.
they'd
have
to
trace
energy
through
facilities
which
serve
thousands
of
customers
in
order
to
get
some
trailer
court's
master
meter.
yet,
this
would
be
necessary
for
the
power
commission
to
do
for
section
201
(a)
of
the
federal
power
act
gives
fpc
jurisdiction
only,
“of
that
part
of
such
business
which
consists
of
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
sale
of
such
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.”
so,
the
federal
power
commission
cannot
assume
or
speculate
that,
because
there
is
some
out-of-state
energy
in
the
an
--
in
the
whole
system,
that
there
is
out-of-state
energy
in
a
particular
sale.
now,
the
federal
power
commission,
in
its
brief,
urged
that
there
would
be
a
detriment
to
federal
power
regulation
unless
it
gets
jurisdiction
over
all
wholesale
sales.
i
think
the
detriment
is
quite
the
other
way.
the
federal
power
commission's
limited
facilities
would
best
be
devoted
to
those
matters
which
do
concern
the
national
interest.
california
has
a
big
stake,
and
all
the
other
states
have
a
big
stake,
in
the
adequate
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission
of
matters
of
multistate
concern.
california
is
definitely
interested
in
the
area
gas
rate
cases,
in
certification
of
gas
pipeline
cases.
and
if
california
utilities
ever
get
into
an
interstate
power
pool,
which
they
don't
belong
to
now,
california
will
be
very
interested
in
the
court
--
in
the
costs
which
the
federal
power
commission
will
determine.
these
are
proper
areas
of
fpc
concern
and
it
would
be
to
the
detriment
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
states
and
to
all
the
consumers
of
the
nation
if
federal
power
commission
is
permitted
to
further
away
the
powers
which
it
has
in
the
area
of
national
interest
to
adjudicate
matters
of
state
concern
while
a
growing
backlog
of
cases
rises
steadily
around
them.
now,
with
regard
to
the
interstate
power
pools,
as
i
have
said,
there
are
none
in
california.
but
if
edison
or
any
other
california
utility
should
join
an
interstate
power
pool,
certainly,
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
costs
of
every
member
of
the
federal
--
of
this
interstate
power
pool.
the
federal
power
commission
has
the
power
and
the
jurisdiction
to
do
that
and
that's
an
es
--
their
essential
function.
if
the
federal
power
commission
does
its
duty
in
this
respect,
its
cost
determinations
will
not
become
outdated,
as
they
appear
to
fear,
and
there
will
be
no
reason
why
the
states
can't
rely
on
cost
determinations
in
interstate
power
pools,
at
least
until
the
determinations
are
changed
by
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
relative
to
the
comment
made
by
mr.
spritzer
and
in
response
to
a
question
from
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
relative
to
davis
energy.
the
fpc
staff
witness,
in
presenting
his
case
relied
only
upon
the
tracing
of
hoover
energy
from
hoover
to
hayfield.
but
i
think
if
the
court
will
--
look
at
the
diagram
which
follows
page
12
of
the
california
commission's
brief,
it
will
see
the
area
in
question
a
little
bit
better.
the
staff
witness
traced
energy
from
hoover
dam
to
the
hayfield
substation
and
then
to
the
highgrove
substation.
now,
with
regard
to
the
stream
of
commerce
mentioned
by
mr.
spritzer,
this
stream
consisted
of
a
very
small
trickle.
in
1958,
the
so-called
stream
from
hoover
consisted
of
1%
of
all
of
edison's
energy.
in
1959,
it
dropped
to
a
fifth
of
1%.
now,
of
course,
there
was
none
coming
over
that
line
from
hoover
dam
into
highgrove
substation.
now,
as
mr.
bury
suggest
before
me,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
pass
upon
the
matter
of
the
tracing
of
energy
assuming,
for
the
purpose
of
decision,
that
the
federal
power
commission's
finding
of
energy
from
hoover
in
the
sale
to
the
city
of
colton
was
sustained
by
adequate
proof.
however,
as
the
fpc
said
in
its
reply
brief
related
--
in
relation
to
the
bolton
c
--
boulder
canyon
project
argument,
we
do
not
consider
that
it
would
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
this
issue
inasmuch
as
the
court
did
not
limit
the
consideration
of
matters
which
are
of
record,
although
the
--
as
i
say,
the
court
below
did
not
pass
upon
this
issue.
now,
the
staff
witness
traced
the
energy
into
the
highgrove
substation
from
hoover
which
edison
admitted.
then
he
said
the
energy
goes
up
to
the
66kv
banks,
then
up
to
the
66kv
substation,
then
some
of
that
energy
goes
through
the
11kv
bust,
all
of
these
are
transformer
stations
which
step
down
the
voltage.
then
it
goes
into
the
sa
--
into
the
city
of
colton
and
colton
resells
it.
he
ignored
the
connection
with
the
chino
substation.
there
is
a
220kv
line
connecting
chino
substation
with
highgrove
substation.
energy
which
is
generated
in
california,
according
to
the
loads
and
demands
of
the
system,
flow
through
the
chino
substation
into
the
highgrove
substation.
he
ignored
also
the
connection
of
the
etiwanda
substation
with
the
highgrove
substation.
energy
from
california
flows
over
that
line
into
the
highgrove
substation.
any
energy
that
gets
in
the
highgrove
substation
flows
up
to
the
66kv
banks
but,
from
there,
the
66kv
lines
go
off
in
both
directions,
serving
thousands
of
customers.
from
there,
the
energy
can
go
up
to
the
11kv
banks
where
11kv
transmission
lines
go
out
and
also
serve
many
thousands
of
customers.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
that
could
be
done,
your
honors,
but
the
whole
record
is
before
the
court.
i
believe
the
court
could
pass
upon
this
factual
matter
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
the
commission,
basing
its
decision
primarily
upon
the
testimony
of
the
staff
witness
who
included
in
his
showing
only
a
portion
of
the
system,
made
the
finding
that
there
was
energy
from
hoover
dam
in
the
sale
to
colton.
they
ignored
all
the
california
sources
of
supply
and
they
ignored
all
the
california
loads
that
could've
consumed
that
hoover
energy
before
it
ever
got
to
colton.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
based
its
decision
upon
another
ground
which
disposed
of
the
case.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
they're
both
correct.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
they
only
decided
one.
that
--
that
ground
is
correctly
decided.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
this
is
another
ground
in
addition
to
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
upon
which
it
also
could've
been
decided
in
favor
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
it
should
remand
it,
naturally,
for
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
think
that
it
should
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
if
it's
to
be
remanded
at
all,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
since
it
has
not
yet
had
judicial
review.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
now,
to
conclude.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
mr.
justice
black?
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
it
would
be
possible
if
the
lines
which
came
from
california
into
the
highgrove
substation
were
metered.
they're
not
metered.
so,
we
don't
know
the
amount
of
energy
that
came
from
the
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
if
they
knew
the
amount
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well
now
your
honor,
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicists
in
the
united
states
was
asked,
“does
electric
energy
mix?”
and
he
answered,
“that
has
never
been
proved.”
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it's
--
it
never
was
proved
in
this
case
that
all
of
the
hoover
energy
might
not
have
gone
out
to
serve
california
customers
over
the
--
let's
say,
the
etiwanda
line
before
it
ever
got
up
into
the
colton
area.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no,
i
don't
think
energy
mixes.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no,
it
runs
through
on
the
same
line.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
gets
on
the
line.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
could
be
possible
i
think
your
honor,
if
a
proper
analysis
had
been
made.
the
physicist
who
testified
said
that
vector
analysis
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
a
vector
analysis
could
be
made
in
order
to
determine
available
loads
and
sources
on
electric
systems.
this
wasn't
done
by
the
federal
power
commission.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no.
but,
in
the
jersey
central
case,
this
court
found,
and
very
properly
so,
that
all
of
the
energy
which
supplied
a
particular
bust
on
a
particular
time
must
have
come
from
out-of-state
since
at
that
time,
there
was
no
available
instate
source
of
supply.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
now,
that
can't
be
said
here.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
your
honor,
that
was
the
burden
of
proof
which
the
proponents
of
the
argument
had,
not
edison
and
not
california.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
to
a
certain
point.
they
didn't
prove
that
it
was
brought
to
the
city
of
colton
and
that's
the
only
sale
that's
before
this
court.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
that
presumption
isn't
based
upon
any
--
the
presumption
that
electric
energy
mixes
is
not
based
upon
anything
that
was
produced
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
clark.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
don't
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
--
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
i
don't
think
that
any
burden
was
upon
either
edison
or
california
to
prove
that
the
energy
did
not
get
to
colton.
it
was
on
the
federal
power
commission
to
prove
that
it
did.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
oh,
i
think
that's
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
--
demonstrable.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well,
you're
ask
--
you're
saying
that
something
is
just
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
now
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
your
honor,
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
the
mixing
of
electric
energy
was
by
--
perhaps,
the
world's
foremost
electrical
physicist
who
said
there's
no
proof
that
electric
energy
does
mix.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
goes
along
the
same
line,
but
does
it
mix?
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
some
energy.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
could
get
to
colton
but
there
is
another
equally
possible
inference
that
it
didn't
and
that
colton
was
served
wholly
by
california
sources
which
are
more
than
adequate
to
serve
colton
and
which
are,
the
record
shows,
available
to
serve
colton
at
all
times.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
who
can
mingled
it?
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it's
just
the
physical
setup
of
the
transmission
lines.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
burden
ever
shifted
to
edison
in
that
respect,
mr.
justice.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
would
be,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
oh,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
at
all,
mr.
justice.
i'm
sure
that
this
court
would
be
at
least
as
competent
as
the
uni
--
the
ninth
circuit.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
with
regard
to
the
boulder
canyon
project
acts,
it
is
a
rare
burden
but,
with
regard
to
the
fact
of
energy
coming
from
out
of
the
state
and
then
subsequently
may
be
or
may
be
not
getting
into
an
instate
sale
after
initial
federal
regulation,
there
are
many
such
cases.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
if
that
were
the
case
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
most
assuredly
would.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
well
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
yes,
if
all
of
the
energy
which
is
the
subject
of
that
sale
is
subsequently
consumed
within
that
state.
now,
if
some
of
that
energy
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
--
goes
out
into
another
state,
then
you
have
a
multistate
concern
again.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
if
the
subsequent
sale
is
wholly
within
the
state,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
i
think
that
there
are
a
fair
number
of
cases,
in
which
sales
at
wholesale
are
initially
federally
regulated,
go
into
a
state
and
are
resold
there
and
are
consumed
within
the
state.
i
think
that
there
are
numbers
of
such
instances
so
that
--
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
--
this
is
not
unique
in
that
respect.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
purchase
from
the
federal
government
of
all
of
the
energy
which
the
metropolitan
water
district
was
not
able
to
use
in
order
for
the
hoover
dam
to
be
built.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
edison.
ms.
mary
moran
pajalich
thank
you,
your
honor.
