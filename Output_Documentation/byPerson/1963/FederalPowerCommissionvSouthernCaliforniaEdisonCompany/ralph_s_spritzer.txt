mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
the
single
question
which
is
raised
by
the
government's
petition
in
this
case
and
the
only
question
which
was
decided
by
the
divided
court
of
appeals
below
is
one
which
relates
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
over
an
aspect
of
interstate
commerce.
the
stream
of
commerce
involved
consists
of
electric
energy.
energy
which
is
generated
by
the
fall
of
the
colorado
river,
generated
in
the
states
of
arizona
and
nevada,
which
is
then
transmitted
by
high-voltage
transmission
lines
into
the
state
of
california
where
it
is,
in
turn,
picked
up
by
the
respondent
southern
california
edison
company,
and
carried
by
it
together
with
energy
which
edison
generates
locally
to
the
city
of
colton,
also
in
california.
colton
operates
a
municipally-owned
distributing
system,
serving
its
some-18,000
or
20,000
residents.
now,
the
particular
transaction
in
this
continuing
movement
in
interstate
commerce
which
is
the
focus
of
the
controversy
here
is
the
sale
of
the
energy
by
edison
to
colton.
and
the
precise
question
is
whether
the
regulation
of
the
rates
at
which
that
sale
takes
place
is
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
commission
or
of
the
california
public
utilities
commission.
edison
and
california
urge
the
latter.
they
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
as
did
the
ninth
circuit
for
purposes
of
its
decision,
that
out-of-state
energy
moves
in
interstate
commerce
to
colton.
but
they
read
the
federal
act
to
permit,
indeed
to
acquire
a
determination
in
each
case
as
to
whether
the
particular
transaction
is
primarily
a
matter
of
national
or
of
local
concern.
and
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
that
test
and
concluded
that
it
was
primarily
a
matter
of
local
concern
in
this
case
and
held
that
the
matter
was
therefore
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
commission
with
judge
browning
dissenting
from
that
view.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you
do
not
because
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
for
purposes
of
decision,
that
there
was
out-of-state
energy
reaching
colton.
now,
that
issue
is
still
available
to
the
respondents
on
remand
because
they
argued
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
demonstrated
at
the
commission
hearings
that
out-of-state
energy
reached
colton.
at
record
940,
you
will
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
commission's
finding
for
purposes
of
its
decision.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
would
not.
the
proponents
of
the
other
view,
of
the
view
that
the
sales
made
to
colton
are
under
the
federal
statute
explicitly
and
exclusively
within
the
federal
domain,
are
three.
first,
the
city
of
colton,
it
is
a
separate
petitioner
here.
and
colton
complains
that
a
series
of
rate
increases
were
put
into
effect
by
edison
and
that
the
charges
which
were
thereafter
made
were
unlawfully
collected
because
those
increases
were
not
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission.
a
second
proponent
of
what
i
might
call
the
federal
view
is
the
american
public
power
association
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
in
the
case
and
represents
more
than
1,200
publicly
owned
distribution
systems
in
some-45
states,
most
of
which
purchased
some
or
all
of
the
energy
which
they
distribute
from
investor-owned
utilities
like
edison.
since
the
association
is
not
participating
in
the
oral
argument,
i
will
pause
a
moment
to
state
though
without
elaboration
the
considerations
which
it
says
give
it
principle
concern.
it
argues
that
a
case-by-case
determination
of
the
national
interest
in
each
sale
and
wholesale,
of
which
there
are
literally
thousands,
would
be
well
--
impossible.
and,
that
it
would
be
at
least
many
years
under
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
before
any
member
of
the
association
would
know
the
appropriate
forum
in
which
to
contest
the
reasonableness
of
a
particular
wholesale
rate
or
service.
it
argues
further
that
even
then,
constantly
changing
conditions
within
the
electric
system
would
deprive
such
a
determination
of
any
finality
or
certainty.
it
argues
finally,
that
the
great
technological
advances
in
the
electric
industry
in
recent
years
have
brought
us,
as
indeed
they
have
to
an
era
where
we
have
virtually
a
national
grid
of
interconnected
power
pools.
and
that
in
this
environment,
the
determination
of
reasonable
wholesale
rates
of
a
public
utility
will
often
require
intimate
knowledge
of
the
very
complex
workings,
contractual
arrangements,
and
financial
operations
of
the
whole
power
pool
of
which
the
particular
utility
is
by
a
part
and
this
it
suggests,
makes
national
regulation
of
sales
and
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
a
practical
imperative
in
many
situations.
the
third
proponent
of
course,
of
the
view
that
this
is
within
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
federal
power
commission.
if
two
is
concerned
with
the
practical
implications
for
other
cases
and
for
its
regulatory
program
of
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
to
this
problem.
mindful
of
my
time
limitations,
i
shall
concern
myself
very
largely
with
the
strictly
legal
and
statutory
basis
of
its
claim
of
jurisdiction.
now,
in
our
view
of
the
statute
we
must
meet
two
and
only
two
very
simple
requirements
in
order
to
prevail.
the
first
is
the
requirement
that
the
sale
of
electric
energy
be
one
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
second
is
that
it
be
a
sale
for
resale
or
as
the
act
sometimes
alternatively
speaks,
the
sale
and
wholesale.
now,
the
first
of
these
facts
was
assumed
by
the
court
below
for
purposes
of
its
decision.
the
second
jurisdictional
fact,
i.e.
that
edison's
sales
to
hol
--
to
colton
are
sales
for
resale
is
clear
and
not
contested.
in
our
view
section
201
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
calls
for
no
further
proof
and
warrants
no
embroidery.
it
appears
at
page
43
of
the
government's
brief
and
it
says
in
terms,
that
the
act
shall
apply
to
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
vital
language
here
to
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
but
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
sale
of
electric
energy.
now,
this
“but”
clause
that
shall
not
apply
to
other
sales
takes
out
of
federal
jurisdiction
sales
at
retail,
sales
for
example
which
colton
makes
to
the
ultimate
user.
our
point
stated
in
a
single
sentence
is
that
for
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
the
act
makes
no
exception.
justice
rutledge
used
almost
those
words
some
years
ago
in
the
public
service
of
indiana
case
in
which
he
was
discussing
the
precisely
parallel
provisions
of
the
gas
act.
he
said,
“the
line
of
the
statute
is
clear
and
complete.
it
cut
sharply
and
cleanly
between
the
sales
for
resale
and
direct
sales
for
consumptive
use.
no
exceptions
were
made.”
i'm
still
quoting,
“no
exceptions
were
made
in
either
category
for
particular
uses,
quantities,
or
otherwise.”
and,
he
concludes
the
line
drawn
by
the
statute
is
that
one
at
which
the
decisions
had
arrived
before
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
another
exception.
there
are
several,
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
our
case
of
course.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
there
were
s
--
there
were
limitations
upon
the
federal
power
spelled
out
throughout
every
--
each
operative
provision
of
this
act,
and
i'm
only
arguing
that,
for
sales
of
energy
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale,
there
was
no
exception.
and
indeed,
justice
rutledge's
statement
that
there
was
no
exception
in
that
category
is
not
an
isolated
expression.
this
court
has
said,
it
not
once,
but
in
one
form
of
words
or
another,
i
think
in
a
dozen
or
more
cases
and
it
has
said
it
in
the
face
of
arguments
made
over
the
years
by
other
utility
companies,
as
some
of
the
members
of
this
court
will
recall,
arguments
which
are
precise
parallel
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
by
edison
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
we
do
draw
upon
on
that
source.
now,
our
adversaries
say
in
answer
that
one
cannot
look
merely
to
section
201
(b)
and
that
one
must
look
also
to
section
201
(a),
which
is
the
statutory
preamble,
and
the
states
that
the
act
extends
only
to
matters
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states.
and
the
suggestion
that
they
make,
is
that
under
present
day
constitutional
standards.
the
transaction
here
in
question
would
not
be
beyond
state
power
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute.
to
this
argument
based
on
201
(a),
we
suggest
there
are
two
answers,
both
of
which
have
indeed
been
made
repeatedly
by
the
court
in
past
decisions.
the
first
answer
is
that
the
policy
expressed
in
201
(a)
is
relevant,
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
connecticut
power
and
light
case,
in
resolving
any
ambiguity
or
indefiniteness
in
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act
but
cannot,
as
justice
jackson
said
in
that
case,
nullify
a
clear
and
specific
grant
of
jurisdiction.
as
i
was
indicating
a
moment
ago
to
your
honor,
we
think
this
makes
particularly
good
sense
in
the
construction
of
a
statute
which
shows
that
the
persons
who
were
concerned
about
preserving
state
authority
undertook
to
write
into
each
operative
provision
the
limitations
upon
federal
authority
which
they
contemplated.
for
example
in
section
204,
which
gave
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
in
securities
by
public
utilities
a
matter
of
certainly
of
great
concern
in
the
1930s,
an
exemption
was
written
in,
exempting
public
utilities
which
were
operating
in
states
where
the
issuance
of
securities
was
already
subject
to
a
state
scheme
of
regulation.
more
appointed
for
our
purposes
of
course,
there
are
series
of
the
limitations
in
201
(b)
itself,
and
our
point
is
that
the
preamble
or
policy
expressed
in
201
(a)
may
be
said
to
explain
or
illuminate
those
limitations
but
should
not
detract,
as
the
court
itself
has
previously
stated,
from
what
is
most
explicitly
granted
to
the
federal
commission.
namely
jurisdiction
over
sales
in
interstate
commerce
and
wholesale.
there's
a
second
answer.
when
congress
said
that
the
federal
power
act
would
provide
for
federal
regulation
only
in
respect
of
matters
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
congress
was
firmly
of
the
view
that
the
states
were
not
able
to
deal
with
sales
and
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
that
indeed
was
the
plain
teaching
of
all
of
the
cases
which
this
court
had
decided
prior
to
1935,
and
congress,
as
we
view
the
history,
said,
in
effect,
“very
well.
we
don't
want
a
no
man's
land
in
this
field
of
utility
regulation.
we
shall
therefore,
reserve
to
the
states
what
the
supreme
court
has
said
the
states
may
do.
and
then
we
shall
command
the
federal
commission
which
we
are
creating
to
do
what
else
remains
to
be
done.
we
shall
draw
a
plain
line
based
upon
the
existing
decisions
and
invest
the
federal
arm
with
authority
to
act
within
its
assigned
area.”
that
perhaps
they
should
say,
that
this
point
something
about
these
pre-1935
cases
where
they
of
course
illuminated
the
history
about
the
power
act,
part
ii,
and
of
the
gas
act
which
was
enacted
a
few
years
later.
now,
there
are
two
main
groups
of
cases
prior
to
1935.
one
group
typified
by
the
pennsylvania
gas
case
which
this
court
decided
in
1919
and
by
the
east
ohio
tax
commission
case
in
1931
involved
the
question
whether
gas
all
or
part
of
which
should
come
from
out-of-state
could
be
subjected
to
rate
regulation
or
to
local
taxation
at
the
point
where
it
was
sold
to
retail
customers.
and
the
court
answered
to
that
question,
"yes."
it
did
so
over
the
years
on
two
theories,
perhaps,
not
all
together
consistent
theories.
the
first
theory
found
in
the
pennsylvania
case
was
that
the
commerce
continues
to
be
interstate.
the
commerce
and
the
gas
right
down
to
the
burner
tips
where
it's
used
by
the
ultimate
consumer.
but
nonetheless,
the
state
may
regulate
the
sale
at
retail
in
the
absence
of
federal
preemption
because
it
is
not
a
matter
of
substantially
local
concern.
the
other
theory
which
was
elaborated
in
the
east
ohio
tax
commission
case
was
that
there's
a
break
in
the
interstate
commerce
at
the
point
where
the
gas
is
greatly
reduced
in
pressure
to
be
carried
through
the
mains
of
the
city
streets.
and
that
therefore,
the
sale
at
retail
by
a
distributor
is
in
intrastate
commerce
coming
after
that
reduction
and
pressure.
both
theories,
however,
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
state
could
deal
with
the
sales
at
retail.
there
was
another
group
of
cases,
a
long
line
of
them,
involving
efforts
by
the
states
to
deal
with
sales
of
out-of-state
or
of
mixed
energy
made
to
distribution
companies
as
distinguished
from
ultimate
consumers,
in
other
words,
sales
at
wholesale.
in
those
cases
of
which
the
kansas
gas
case
and
the
attleboro
case
are
landmark
examples.
the
court
concluded
and
without
any
exception
that
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
could
not
be
regulated
either
by
the
state
in
which
the
energy
originated
or
in
the
receiving
state
because
that
would
be
a
forbidden
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
now,
these
groups
of
cases
are
the
cases
that
justice
rutledge
was
talking
about
when
he
said,
in
the
excerpt
that
i
quoted
earlier,
that
congress
drew
a
short
line
admitting
of
no
exceptions
between
sales
in
interstate
commerce
at
wholesale
and
sales
at
retail,
and
that
the
line
drawn
was
the
one
at
which
the
decisions
had
arrived
before
that
part
ii
of
the
power
act
was
passed.
let
me
move
forward
if
i
may,
from
the
pre-statutory
cases
to
the
decisions
which
followed,
decisions
in
which
this
court
defined
again
and
again
the
jurisdictional
line.
the
first
important
one
from
our
--
for
our
purposes
is
illinois
gas
against
central
illinois
in
1942.
now,
the
illinois
gas
company
was
a
pipeline
operating
wholly
within
illinois,
comparable
in
its
function
to
edison,
but
purchasing
out-of-state
gas
from
its
parent
panhandle,
and
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
the
illinois
commission
could
order
illinois
gas
to
interconnect
with
a
distribution
company
in
a
city
in
illinois
or
whether
that
power
rested
solely
with
the
federal
commission.
this
is
a
precisely
analogous
question
because
the
question
of
jurisdiction
over
the
extension
of
facilities
turns
on
precisely
the
same
considerations
as
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
of
natural
gas
or
--
companies
or
of
electric
utilities.
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
stone
points
out
at
some
length
that
before
the
enactment
of
the
power
in
gas
acts
there
had
been
litigation
as
to
the
limits
upon
state
authority.
he
points
to
the
two
lines
of
cases
to
which
i've
referred,
the
one
which
suggested
that
you
would
balance
national
and
local
interests
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
state
could
exercise
jurisdiction
over
a
sale
at
retail
even
though
it
was
part
of
the
stream
of
commerce
and
the
other
line
of
the
cases
involving
a
so-called
mechanical
approach
theory
of
a
break
in
commerce.
he
con
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
his
conclusion,
and
this
is
my
main
point
of
course,
is
that
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
consider
either
the
balancing
approach
or
the
mechanical
one
of
a
break
in
commerce.
congress
he
says,
adopted
the
power
in
the
gas
act
to
define
the
area
of
interstate
commerce
in
which
the
federal
commission
would
regulate.
its
definition,
he
says,
put
in
the
federal
sphere
the
regulation
of
all
sales
at
wholesale.
the
other
part
of
the
bargain
was
that
the
states
would
have
clear
and
unequivocal
authority
to
regulate
all
sales
at
retail.
and
thus
it
ended,
he
says.
it
ended
any
need
for
case-by-case
litigation
of
the
respective
interests
of
state
and
the
nation.
and
i
would
add
to
that,
that
what
congress,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
ended
the
ninth
circuit
has
now
seemingly
resurrected.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
case
i
was
referring
to
is
illinois
gas,
the
central
illinois
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
it's
cited
at
length
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
just
a
few
years
later,
this
court
had
the
colorado
federal
power
commission
against
colorado-wyoming
before
it.
colorado-wyoming
was
a
pipeline
which
purchased
gas
from
an
interstate
carrier
at
littleton,
colorado.
it
then
carried
it
to
a
number
of
colorado
towns
and
the
contention
was
made
that
colorado-wyoming's
sales
of
this
gas
to
the
colorado
communities
was
intrastate
and
not
subject
to
federal
regulation.
this
court
rejected
that
in
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
stating
that
there
was
a
continuous
stream
of
the
gas
from
the
out-of-state
source
and
that
therefore
it
was
clearly
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
the
court
placed
no
reliance
whatever
upon
the
fact
that
the
colorado-wyoming
company
also
made
one
sale
outside
of
colorado,
downstream
in
wyoming.
it
refrained
from
any
examination
of
the
consequences,
practical
or
otherwise,
of
the
transactions
in
colorado
upon
other
states
ruling,
as
it
had
ruled
in
the
earlier
central
illinois
case,
that
the
statutory
language
was
determinative
of
the
federal
commission's
jurisdiction
by
its
own
force.
still,
a
third
case
of
similar
import
is
federal
power
commission
versus
east
ohio
gas
company
in
the
338
u.s.
east
ohio
bought
gas
at
the
ohio
border
from
the
interstate
pipelines
again,
operating
solely
within
ohio.
it
then
carried
the
gas
through
its
high-pressured
trunk
lines
to
its
own
local
distribution
centers
--
systems
in
various
ohio
towns.
since
east
ohio
made
no
sales
for
resale,
it
was
not
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
provisions
of
section
1
(b)
which
have
to
do
with
sales
for
resale.
but
section
1
(b)
also
covers
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
questions
was
whether
east
ohio
was
subject
to
the
federal
commission's
accounting
and
reporting
requirements
because
it
was
transporting
in
interstate
commerce.
this
court
agreed
with
the
federal
power
commission
that
it
was
stating
that
there
appeared
no
--
to
be
no
question
in
its
mind
that
the
gas
was
uninterruptedly
flowing
in
interstate
commerce
until
it
reached
the
towns
where
it
was
consumed.
the
opinion
then
deals
with
the
argument
which
is
being
made
again
that
congress
intended
only
to
regulate
what
the
states
were
without
constitutional
power
to
regulate.
the
answer
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
speaking
for
the
court
is
that
this
court's
decisions
prior
to
1935
had
made
plain
to
congress
that
the
state's
power
was
confined
to
sales
at
retail.
let
me
quote
a
sentence
of
his
opinion
directly.
“in
a
series
of
cases
repeatedly
called
to
the
attention
of
the
house
committees,
this
court
had
declared
that
states
could
regulate
interstate
commerce
only
after
it
was
reduced
in
pressure
and
entered
a
local
distribution
system.
this
was
the
gap
which
congress
intended
to
close.
we
have
already
held
that,
in
doing
so,
congress
subjected
to
federal
regulation
a
company
transporting
interstate
gas
and
selling
it
for
resale
wholly
within
one
state,
citing
the
illinois
gas
case.”
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that,
“east
ohio
differs
in
that
it
sells
gas
direct
to
consumers
but
that
the
difference
is
immaterial
for
purposes
of
that
case
since
east
ohio
transports
in
interstate
commerce.”
but
i
--
i
shall
not
burden
the
court
by
stating
the
facts
of
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
this
jurisdictional
line
but
to
bring
the
matter
up
to
date,
i
will
note
that
the
court
stated
in
the
phillips
case
in
1954
that
the
legislative
history
showed
a
clear
purpose.
and
i
quote,
"to
give
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
of
all
wholesales
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce".
justice
frankfurter,
concurring
in
that
same
case,
stated
that
the
history
showed
that
congress
drew
a
fixed
line
instead
of
leaving
the
matter,
he
states,
"to
the
fluctuation
of
adjudications
under
the
commerce
clause."
again,
on
the
last
term
in
the
northern
natural
gas
case
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
for
the
court,
concededly
a
case
involving
a
quite
different
problem
from
the
one
presented
here.
the
court
again
observed
that
it
was
settled
before
the
passage
of
the
natural
gas
act
that
direct
regulation
of
the
prices
of
wholesales
was
beyond
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
states
and
that
congress
had
legislated
on
that
assumption.
now,
edison
repeatedly
argues
in
its
brief
that
there's
no
interest
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
or
of
any
state
other
than
california
in
the
edison-colton
sale.
now,
of
course
the
burden
of
my
argument
has
been
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
measure
the
respective
interests
of
state
and
nation.
we
are
dealing
with
interstate
commerce
by
definition,
here
and
we
think
congress
has
drawn
the
line,
as
it
certainly
had
the
power
to
do,
without
any
exception
for
any
sale
in
interstate
commerce
at
wholesale.
but
i
would
also
challenge
if
it
were
necessary,
the
thought
that
only
california
has
an
interest
in
the
sale.
i
think
that
since
this
is
an
interstate
sale,
there
is
inevitably
a
potential
multistate
interest.
when
a
commodity
moves
in
interstate
commerce
from
one
state
to
another,
the
terms
upon
which
resales
take
place
in
the
receiving
jurisdiction
inevitably
have
a
bearing
upon
the
flow
of
commerce
into
the
state
and
that
of
course,
is
the
whole
assumption
upon
which
this
court
has
decided,
i
don't
know
how
many
score
of,
sherman
act
cases.
when
goods
are
sold
in
state
a
to
customer
in
state
b
and
they
in
turn,
let
us
say,
fix
prices,
either
at
the
wholesale
or
at
the
retail
level,
the
courts
conclusively
presume
that
there
is
a
restraint
upon
the
commerce
which
moves
into
the
state.
and
it
certainly
then,
one
can't
assume
that
there
is
no
effect
resulting
from
state
regulation
upon
a
flow
of
commerce
which
moves
into
the
state
from
outside.
i
would
say
certainly
that
what
is
true
of
transactions
in
commodities
under
the
sherman
act
is
certainly
no
less
true
of
sales
of
energy.
indeed
i
suggest
that
one
could
hardly
work
for
24
hours
at
the
federal
power
commission
on
rate
matters
and
not
be
keenly
aware
that
slight
changes
in
the
cost
of
energy
work
substantial
shifts
to
or
from
the
use
of
competitive
fuels.
if
rates
for
power,
for
example,
to
a
municipality
go
up,
it's
safe
to
predict
that
there
will
be
substantial
shifts
to
natural
gas
or
to
fuel
oil
or
to
coal,
particularly
by
the
industrial
users.
now,
my
point
is
not
that
one
must
predict
and
measure
these
consequences
in
each
case,
quite
the
contrary.
it
is
my
point,
at
the
moment
is
merely
to
suggest
that
there
are
good
practical
reasons
why
a
legislator
might
conclude
that
the
line
should
be
drawn
where
congress,
in
our
view,
has
drawn
it.
the
chief
argument
we
make
of
course,
is
that
there's
no
occasion
since
congress
has
legislated
clearly,
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
said,
to
go
beyond
the
statute
itself.
i
would
like
to
note
very
briefly,
one
other
significant
practical
implication,
as
the
commission
sees
it
of
the
decision
below.
the
federal
commission's
power
to
order
interconnections
between
electric
utilities
turns
on
substantially
the
same
jurisdictional
considerations
as
governed
its
power
to
regulate
sales.
in
other
words,
if
the
commission,
because
of
the
interpretation
of
201
(a)
which
the
respondents
suggests,
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
for
the
sales
by
edison
to
colton,
by
the
same
reasoning,
it
could
not
order
interconnections
as
between
utilities
similarly
situated
but
lacking
such
physical
connections.
this
in
the
commission's
view
would
impair
its
ability
to
achieve
important
objectives
which
are
set
forth
in
section
202
of
the
act.
namely
to
promote
such
interconnections
as
will
assure
maximum
economy
and
the
optimum
utilization
of
natural
resources.
now,
it
is
true
that
some
state
commissions,
though
by
no
means
at
all,
have
authority
to
order
interconnections
between
utility
subject
to
their
jurisdiction.
it's
also
true
we
think,
that
the
comprehensive
development
of
regional
and
national
grids
which
will
bring
to
the
country
at
large
the
benefits
--
great
benefits
available
through
the
pooling
and
exchange
of
power
that
that
development
calls
for
overall
rather
than
for
a
piecemeal
direction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
thank
you,
your
honor.
before
closing,
i
should
like
to
make
brief
reference
to
one
item
of
subsequent
legislation.
in
1954,
congress
amended
the
gas
act,
not
the
power
act,
so
as
to
exempt
with
certain
limitations,
to
which
i'll
refer
in
a
moment,
so
as
to
exempt
gas
companies
receiving
natural
gas
within
a
state
and
transmitting
it
or
selling
it
for
ultimate
consumption
within
the
same
state.
that
was
the
so-called
hinshaw
amendment
to
the
gas
act.
and
it
adopted
an
approach
which
is
not
unlike
that
which
edison
would
adopt,
not
through
legislation
but
through
interpretation,
for
the
power
act.
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
connection
with
that
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
we've
quoted
all
of
the
parallel
provisions
of
the
gas
act
at
the
back
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
1
(c)
--
section
1
(c),
i
believe
we've
set
it
forth.
yes,
it's
at
page
49
of
the
government's
brief,
your
honor.
there
are
two
points,
as
i
was
saying,
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
connection
with
that
amendment.
the
first
is
the
obvious
one,
that
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
withdraw
any
of
the
commission's
authority
in
the
electric
power
field,
although
it
has
certainly
been
long
aware
that
the
commission
has
exercised
jurisdiction
over
so-called
second
sales
of
electricity.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
was
about
to
say
there
was
a
bill
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
power
act
as
was
done
by
the
hinshaw
amendment
for
the
gas
act.
in
fact,
the
proposal
was
made
earlier
on
the
power
side.
it
was
opposed
by
the
commission.
it
died
in
committee.
and
so,
as
we
see
it,
edison
is
in
substance,
asking
the
court
to
do
what
congress
in
the
case
of
the
power
act
has
refused
to
do.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
about
the
hinshaw
amendment
is
this.
it
does
not
confer
a
blanket
exemption.
it
is
available
to
a
gas
pipeline
only
when
wholesale
gas
rates
where
service
of
the
company
will
be
actively
regulated
by
a
state
commission.
now,
this
conditional
provision
for
a
withdrawal
of
federal
authority
cannot
be
squared,
we
think
with
edison's
suggestion
that
the
federal
power
act
should
be
read
as
not
conferring
any
authority
to
begin
with,
over
sales
of
the
kind
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
under
edison's
view
of
the
statute
this
was
a
matter
wholly
reserved
to
the
states
and
the
federal
power
commission
could
not
act
even
if
--
contrary
to
the
actual
case,
even
if
california
had
no
public
utilities
commission.
there
are
of
course
a
number
of
states
which
do
not
have
public
utility
regulation.
in
a
word
we
submit
that
the
only
fair
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
hinshaw
amendment
of
the
gas
act
is
that
if
the
federal
power
act
is
to
be
similarly
amended,
it
is
the
function
of
congress
and
not
of
the
judiciary
to
do
so.
the
commission
i
need
hardly
--
federal
commission,
i
need
hardly
add
in
conclusion,
would
oppose
such
an
amendment,
as
it
has
done
successfully
in
the
past.
thank
you.
