mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
breadth
of
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act
which
inheres
in
this
case.
it
is
a
question
which
was
decided
against
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
by
the
hearing
examiner
in
the
first
instance,
then
was
reversed
by
the
federal
power
commission
which
upheld
its
jurisdiction
under
section
201,
and
finally,
was
pretermitted
in
the
court
below.
the
question
involves
section
6
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
in
whether,
instead
of
the
federal
power
commissions
having
jurisdiction
at
all,
the
jurisdiction
lies
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
section
6
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
is
quoted
in
pertinent
part
at
page
6
of
--
8
--
page
8
of
colton's
brief
and
perhaps
i
should
read
some
of
the
pertinent
language.
that
act
provides,
“the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
prescribe
and
enforce
rules
and
regulations
conforming
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
water
power
act
so
far
as
applicable,
respecting
control
of
rates
in
the
absence
of
state
regulation
or
interstate
agreement.”
and
it
goes
on
to
provide
that,
“he
shall
also
conform
with
other
provisions
of
the
federal
water
power
act
and
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission
already
devised
or
hereafter
devised
for
the
protection
of
the
consumer.”
the
position
of
respondent
has
been
throughout
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
in
the
circumstance
like
that
because,
when
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
was
adopted
in
1928,
the
federal
power
commission
tried
to
get
jurisdiction
but
congress
deliberately
placed
jurisdiction
with
the
secretary.
now,
we
challenge
that
view
on
both
grounds.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
true
that
the
federal
power
commission
tried
to
get
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
what
the
federal
power
commission
did
in
reporting
on
the
repeated
series
of
bills
which
ultimately
culminated
in
that
act,
was
to
point
out
that
congress
had
deliberately
adopted
a
policy
of
private
development
of
these
great
hydroelectric
resources
together
with
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
this
was
flying
in
the
face
of
that
to
propose
a
federal
development.
in
the
second
place,
you
will
note
from
the
language
which
i
just
read;
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
required
to
conform
to
the
federal
power
act
and
to
obey
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission.
that
was
logical
enough.
at
that
time
he
was
one
of
the
three
members
of
the
federal
power
commission
as
it
then
existed.
accordingly,
the
very
provision
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
looked
to
compliance
with
the
federal
water
power
act
as
it
then
understood.
we
think
that
section
201
coming
some-seven
years
later,
which
provided
that
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
rates
shall
apply
to
sales
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
clearly
puts
the
matter
beyond
question.
now,
perhaps
before
i
get
too
far
into
it,
i
ought
to
confess
that
this
issue,
possibly,
is
not
justiciable
because
there
is
not
solely
involved
boulder
canyon
energy.
the
federal
power
commission
found
that
boulder
canyon
energy
is
mixed
with
davis
energy,
likewise
generated
outside
of
the
state
of
california,
another
great
federal
hydroelectric
installation,
and
that
that
mixture
is
served
to
the
city
of
colton.
sometimes,
it's
the
sole
supply
of
the
city
over
many
hours.
i
believe
the
commission
made
the
finding.
now,
boulder
canyon
project
act
specifically
does
not
apply
to
davis
energy.
the
provision
which
would
apply
there
is
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act
and
by
the
rule
which
this
court
adopted
in
the
pennsylvania
water
case
in
343
u.s.,
and
had
mixture
of
jurisdiction
on
energy,
gives
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
of
the
whole.
otherwise,
it
would
be
unable
to
regulate
that
federal
energy.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
then
it
wasn't
really
challenged
either.
the
issue
which
was
challenged
as
a
matter
of
fact
there,
was
whether
it
was
proved
by
colton
and
by
the
commission
that
any
interstate
energy
at
all
reached
colton.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
respondents,
in
effect,
that
it
was
impossible
to
trace
a
flow
of
electric
energy
in
the
circumstances
that
existed
here.
but,
they
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
didn't
challenge
the
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
not
by
the
court
below,
no,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
was
by
the
commission.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
yes.
and
that's
the
reason
that
i
dare
not
rely
on
its
being
nonjusticiable
and
rely
merely
on
davis
energy.
the
hearing
examiner
said
that,
clearly,
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
gave
the
secretary
of
the
interior
jurisdiction.
the
commission
said
both
boulder
canyon
or
hoover
dam,
i
should
say,
and
davis
energy
is
mixed
here
and
sent
on
to
colton,
but
we
think
it's
in
our
jurisdiction
anyway
because
of
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
very
phrase
which
mr.
spritzer
has
been
calling
to
the
court's
attention
gives
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
notwithstanding
the
origin
of
the
power
at
boulder
canyon.
that
phrase,
the
provisions
of
section
201
(b),
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
apply
to
sales
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
there
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
correct.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
as
it
now
exists.
there
was
an
earlier
federal
water
power
act
which
is
now
title
1.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
1920.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that
is
now
title
1
of
the
federal
power
act.
it
was
reenacted
in
1935.
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
feel
that,
without
respect
to
--
into
this
question
of
davis
energy
which
i
but
require
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
or
the
matter
of
--
well,
let
me
backup
there,
two
reasons
why
section
201
overrides
what
otherwise
would
have
been
the
effect
of
section
6
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
even
if
it
had
the
effect
contended
for
by
respondent.
in
the
first
place,
section
6
is
exactly
like
section
20
of
the
federal
power
act,
that's
part
i
of
the
federal
power
act,
the
old
act
to
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred,
which
gave
a
limited
sort
of
federal
regulation.
it
said
that,
as
licensees
of
a
federal
development,
the
federal
power
commission
could,
in
the
absence
of
state
regulation,
undertake
to
regulate
sales
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
after
the
federal
power
act
was
adopted
with
its
much
broader
jurisdiction
the
section
201
jurisdiction
in
which
we
refer
in
1935,
on
two
occasions,
there
was
litigated
before
this
court
the
contention
that
well
we're
a
licensee
under
title
1
of
the
federal
power
act.
therefore,
we
come
under
your
section
20
jurisdiction
and
you
don't
--
you,
the
federal
power
commission,
don't
have
jurisdiction
over
us
under
section
201.
and
in
both
instances,
this
court
held
that
that
contention
could
not
prevail.
it
did
so
in
united
states
against
public
utilities
commission
of
california
in
345
u.s.
and
in
the
pennsylvania
water
case
in
343
u.s.
the
provisions
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
are
in
entire
parody
with
those
of
section
20
of
the
federal
power
act.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
a
limited
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
state
regulation
which,
it's
contended
would
make
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
inoperative
here
anyway.
but
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
gave
in
both
those
cases,
pennsylvania
water
and
united
states
against
public
utilities
commission
of
california,
the
contention
cannot
survive
here.
section
201
was
intended
to
have
a
broad
sweep.
there
is
internal
evidence
that
congress
would
have
accepted
hoover
energy
sold
at
wholesale
if
it
had
intended
that
that
be
exempted
from
section
201
of
the
federal
power
act,
and
this
is
the
second
reason
we
give.
section
201
(f)
accepts,
first,
federal
sales
no
matter
where
they
are
in
hoover
dam,
davis
dam
and
under
the
reclamation
act,
bonneville
power
administration,
tennessee
valley
authority,
or
other
federal
installations.
and
that
shows
that
there
must
be
a
specific
exemption
or
congress
thought
it
was
covering
the
sales
in.
but
that's
still
left
with
the
particular
federal
agent
who
sells
the
power
because
he's
under
instructions
to
get
the
money
to
repay,
within
a
specified
time,
the
investment
of
the
united
states
in
building
those
installations.
thus
congress
made
a
specific
exception
where
it
intended
it.
there
were
other
expressed
exemptions.
congress
exempted
national
parks
from
the
licensing
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission.
it
preserved
regulation
by
a
different
federal
agency,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
the
public
utilities
company
holding
act
which
shows
that
congress
felt
that
if
it
hadn't
preserved
that
specifically,
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
had
it
instead
of
the
sec.
it
preserved
the
power
of
states
over
the
limiting
or
regulating
the
exportation
of
power
produced
within
the
states,
showing
that
that
was
specifically
necessary.
and
it
preserved
state
commission
regulation
of
the
issue
of
securities.
all
of
this
shows
that
congress
was
perfectly
aware
that
it
was
passing
a
comprehensive
statute
settling
federal
policy
on
the
scope
and
breadth
of
this
regulation
which
it
was
investing
with
the
federal
power
commission.
accordingly,
if
section
201
is
totally
inconsistent
with
a
regulation
of
a
peculiar
block
of
interstate
energy
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
indeed
any
other
federal
agency
than
the
federal
power
commission,
such
a
holding
would
be
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
the
sweep
of
the
provisions
of
section
201.
