mr.
john
r.
bury
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
boulder
canyon
project
legislation
of
course
provides
an
additional
independent
ground
for
affirming
the
court
of
appeals.
the
significance
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
legislation
in
this
case
is
two-folds.
first,
it
provides
the
legal
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
to
edison
of
its
only
source
of
out-of-state
energy.
second,
it,
by
its
terms,
precludes
fpc
jurisdiction
over
the
subsequent
resale
of
such
energy
by
edison
in
california.
as
to
the
first
matter,
the
only
interstate
aspect
of
edison's
business
is
its
purchase
of
electric
energy
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
edison's
rights
to
purchase
that
energy
are
fixed
by
a
contract
executed
pursuant
to
that
legislation.
now,
the
allotments
of
power
to
hoover
and
the
rates
to
be
charged
are
fixed
by
those
contracts
and
by
the
terms
of
the
act,
and
all
must
concede
that
the
states
of
arizona,
nevada,
and
california
have
a
very
vital
interest
in
those
allotments
of
power
and
the
price
which
the
united
states
will
charge.
however,
each
of
those
matters
had
been
and
still
are
under
the
full
effective
and
exclusive
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
pursuant
to
that
legislation.
so
that
under
these
circumstances,
every
aspect
of
edison's
business
which
could
possibly
affect
the
interest
of
the
states
of
nevada
or
arizona
or
the
united
states
are
fully
subject
to
existing
federal
control.
now,
as
to
the
subsequent
sale
of
such
energy
by
edison
in
california,
boulder
canyon
project
act
provides
by
section
6,
quoted
by
mr.
cragun,
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
prescribe
and
enforce
regulations
for
the
control
of
rates
and
other
matters
to
be
exercised,
however,
only
in
the
absence
of
state
regulation.
mr.
john
r.
bury
i
think
this
can
best
be
answered
this
way,
although
i
would
grant
you
there
is
a
factual
dispute
which
has
not
yet
been
subject
to
judicial
review
as
to
the
existence
of
davis
energy.
and
with
respect
to
that
i
might
say,
that
the
government
or
the
federal
power
commission
has
never
offered
any
proof
that
those
sales
have
occurred
subsequent
to
a
date
back
in
1956
and
at
that
time,
wherein
quantities
so
small
as
to
be
below
the
margin
of
error
of
the
values
of
the
devices
used
to
measure
those
flows.
but,
i
think
the
key
answer,
perhaps,
to
davis
is
this.
edison's
only
contract
for
out-of-state
energy
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
for
hoover
energy.
in
addition,
edison
acts
as
an
agent
for
the
united
states
in
the
operation
of
hoover
power
plant.
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
that
agency
contract,
the
united
states
has
reserved
the
right
to
integrate
its
plants
on
the
colorado
river,
so
that
if
the
united
states,
in
the
exercise
of
that
right
of
integration,
has
substituted
davis
energy
for
hoover
energy,
and
we
do
not
concede
factually
that
this
had
been
done.
but
if
it
has
been
done,
it
was
done
pursuantly
only
to
that
contract
by
which
edison
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
united
states
and
not
as
a
contractor
or
purchaser
for
such
energy.
now,
by
section
6,
the
authority
to
regulate
rates
for
the
resale
of
energy
purchased
by
the
sec
--
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
been
reserved
to
the
states
and
only
in
the
absence
of
state
regulation
to
the
secretary.
it
is
amply
clear
that
the
regulatory
authority
vested
in
the
secretary
by
section
6
is
the
same
authority
which
fpc
is
here
trying
to
claim
for
itself.
some
historical
background
to
put
this
in
perspective
would
probably
be
helpful.
i
won't
take
the
court's
time
with
that
now
but
i
would
commend
to
the
court's
attention
an
exchange
of
correspondence
between
edison
and
the
federal
power
commission
back
in
1953
and
1954.
this
will
be
found
in
the
record,
commencing
at
about
page
673
and,
in
there,
contains
a
memorandum
rest
--
residing
the
pertinent
historical
facts
in
the
legislative
history
behind
section
6
and
its
effect
on
the
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
the
passage
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
the
execution
of
edison's
contracts
were
all
based
upon
the
understanding
that
the
power
was
being
sold
by
the
secretary
for
transmission
into
california
and
for
resale
by
edison
in
california
for
that
was
the
only
market
for
that
power.
and
that
such
sales
in
california
had
been
and
would
continue
to
be
regulated
by
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california.
and
i
believe
it
is
fair
to
state
that
the
petitioners
concede
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
regulate
such
sales,
at
least
prior
to
the
enactment
of
part
ii
of
the
federal
power
act
in
1935.
their
argument
then
appears
to
be
that,
one,
the
secretary's
authority
under
section
6
of
the
project
act
is
somewhat
comparable.
i
think,
to
claim
that
it
is
substantially
identical
would
not
bear
scrutiny
if
the
act's
sections
were
compared.
but
anyway,
they
claim
there
is
a
comparability
and
that
this
court
has
held,
in
u.s.
versus
p.u.c.,
that
when
in
1935,
the
federal
power
commission's
authority
overrates
was
expanded,
the
new
sections
superseded
the
prior
sections
which
were
then
inconsistent.
and
then
try
to
make
from
that
the
more
radical
assertion
that
it
not
--
that
the
enactment
of
part
ii
not
only
superseded
the
federal
power
commission
prior
to
--
prior
authority
over
rates
but
went
so
far
as
to
revoke
the
authority
of
an
entirely
independent
branch
of
the
government
which
--
in
which
power
was
granted
by
a
separate
piece
of
legislation.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
basis
for
holding
that
section
6
has
been
repealed
by
implication
or
otherwise.
back
to
the
contrary,
congress
has
periodically
reviewed
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and,
in
1940,
some-five
years
after
the
federal
power
act,
substantially
amended
section
6.
the
congress
left
intact
and
without
change
the
secretary's
authority
over
the
rates
of
resale
of
energy
of
hoover
power
plant.
(inaudible)
your
honor,
as
mr.
cragun
related,
this
is
an
issue
which
has
been
litigated
or
have
been
present
in
this
case
from
its
inception.
the
presiding
examiner
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
heard
this
case
disposed
it
on
this
ground
and
ruled
that
the
federal
power
commission
was
without
authority.
it
was
then
reversed
by
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
upon
this.
however,
petitioner,
city
of
colton,
raised
it
in
its
petition
for
certiorari,
and
the
court's
order
granting
certiorari
of
course
was
in
no
way
limited.
mr.
john
r.
bury
no
sir.
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
make
that
concession
because
i
believe
the
secretary's
authority
springs
from
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties,
and
the
only
contractual
relationship
here
between
edison
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
with
respect
to
hoover
power.
mr.
john
r.
bury
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
r.
bury
the
court
of
appeals
found,
and
quite
properly,
that
this
case
could
be
disposed
of
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
power
act
reserved
to
the
states
the
full
regulatory
power
which
they
had
under
the
commerce
clause
and
that,
of
course,
is
dispositive
to
the
case.
mr.
john
r.
bury
the
commission
--
i
would
not
concede
that
the
commission
really
made
a
finding.
they
spoke
on
the
subject
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
witness
who
testified
on
this
subject
said
there
was
a
connection
between
davis
and
hoover
power
plants
and
that
energy
coming
over
a
given
line
could
have
come
from
hoover
or
davis.
but
nowhere
in
that
record
did
any
witness
testify
that
it
was
davis
energy
or
even
in
his
opinion
was
it
davis
energy.
mr.
john
r.
bury
well,
i
think
the
two
basic
grounds
are
independent
to
that
extent
if
they
--
mr.
john
r.
bury
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
as
i
say,
they
only
--
they
speak
of
this
in
somewhat
inexact
--
in
a
somewhat
inexact
manner.
there
is
only
one
other
--
two
minor
points
with
respect
to
the
boulder
canyon
project
legislation
i
would
like
to
get
upon.
one
is
that
petitioners
claim
that
perhaps
this
unique
statute,
if
given
effect
according
to
its
terms,
would
create
some
kind
of
a
substantial
white
area
in
fpc's
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
southern
california
edison
company
is
the
only
party
which
would
be
affected
by
this
particular
statute
for
the
reason
that
all
other
lrts
of
hoover
power
happen
to
be
public
agencies
which
are
exempt
from
rate
regulation
by
fpc
or
by
the
states.
(inaudible)
and
that
indicated
this
case
--
this
particular
statute
is
not
only
--
or
this
issue
was
not
only
uniquely
narrow,
it
naturally
must
be
somewhat
novel
in
this
case.
it's
not
novel
to
the
commission,
as
i
say,
because
this
matter
was
explored
with
them
over
10
years
ago
when
they
first
made
claims
of
jurisdiction.
and
edison
furnished
them
with
the
comprehensive
statement
of
the
legislative
history
and
it's
reasonable.
i
believe
this
act
precluded
fpc
jurisdiction
and,
at
time,
the
commission
seized
its
demand
until
such
time
as
colton
filed
its
complaint
some-four
or
five
years
later
which
initiated
this
proceeding.
mr.
john
r.
bury
the
only
--
we're
now
speaking
as
of
today.
i
believe,
as
of
the
time
that
the
record
was
closed
in
this
case,
the
california
electric
power
company
was
also
an
lrt
of
hoover
power.
i
might
explain
--
mr.
john
r.
bury
--
that
there
are
others
who
are
indirect
purchasers
because
the
states
of
arizona
and
nevada
have
created
public
entities
to
purchase
their
full
state's
allotments
and
that
the
colorado
river
commission
of
nevada
purchased
the
entire
state's
allotment
and
the
arizona
power
authority
purchasing
the
entire
allotment
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
john
r.
bury
the
private
companies,
being
subsequent
purchasers,
do
not
have
this
contractual
relationship
and
the
direct
control
and
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
which
does
exist
with
respect
edison.
mr.
john
r.
bury
that's
right,
at
least
i
believe
this
is
true.
i'd
like
to
pass
on
one
other
matter
briefly
and
that
is
that
the
federal
power
commission
in
its
reply
brief
filed
the
other
day,
raised
this
question
of
mootness,
and
this
related
to
edison's
offer
to
prove
upon
rehearing
that
its
purchases
of
out-of-state
energy,
upon
which
fpc
based
its
case,
had
seized
early
in
1961.
now,
edison
does
agree
that
there
is
a
live
controversy
here,
primarily
because
of
colton's
claim
to
be
entitled
to
refunds
for
a
substantial
past
period.
in
fact
indeed,
it's
for
this
reason
that
edison
believed
it
was
improper
to
consider
matters
such
as
the
recent
merger
with
california
electric
power
company
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
closing
of
the
record.
it
should
be
noted
however,
that
colton's
claim
to
refunds
is
not
based
on
any
claim
that
the
rates
which
were
charged
by
edison
were
unreasonable.
they
are
based
solely,
as
mr.
spritzer
mentioned,
upon
edison's
failure
to
file.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
colton
participated
in
the
california
proceedings,
fixing
those
rates
and,
at
no
time
before
that
commission,
ever
challenges
jurisdiction.
but
it
wasn't
as
edison's
contention
that
the
termination
of
its
out-of-state
purchases,
upon
which
fpc
based
this
jurisdiction,
occurred
before
the
end
of
the
period
for
which
the
fpc
ordered
an
accounting
for
refunds
and
before
the
end
of
the
period
for
which
colton
claims
refund,
and
that
this
case
has
become
moot
from
and
after
that
time
and
that
it
was
erred
for
the
federal
power
commission
to
refuse
to
consider
this
change
of
circumstances
at
that
time.
thank
you.
