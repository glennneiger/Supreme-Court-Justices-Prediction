mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
for
southern
california
edison
company
and
i
will
direct
my
argument
to
the
issue
which
was
argued
by
mr.
spritzer
for
the
government
and
which
is
the
issue
to
which
the
ninth
circuit
confined
itself
in
disposing
of
the
case
before
the
circuit.
i
will
be
followed
by
mr.
bury,
also
of
the
edison
company
who
will
address
himself
to
the
boulder
canyon
project
legislation
which
represents
an
independent
ground
for
the
sustaining
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
it
is
the
position
of
the
edison
company
that
the
sales
by
the
edison
company,
which
is
a
california
company
operating
wholly
in
california,
to
the
city
of
colton,
which
is
a
california
city,
should
be
regulated
by
the
california
commission.
the
california
commission
has
regulated
those
sales
for
more
than
50
years.
the
basis
for
our
belief
that
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
does
not
lie
is
that
the
sales
in
question
are
purely
local
in
character
and
are
devoid
of
national
interest.
now,
for
purposes
of
argument,
we
assume,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit,
that
the
edison
company
does
sell
to
the
city
of
colton
in
california
energy
received
from
the
hoover
dam
in
arizona.
so,
we
have
in
effect,
two
chains
of
interstate
wholesale
sales.
first
of
all,
we
have
the
sale
by
the
u.s.
government
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior
at
hoover
to
the
edison
company.
then
we
have
a
second
downstream
sale
for
resale,
this
one
being
within
california
by
the
edison
company
or
that
hoover
energy
to
the
city
of
colton.
i
should
say
parenthetically,
that
the
edison
company
does
not
concede
as
a
factual
matter
that
any
hoover
energy
does
reach
the
city.
we
believe
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
on
that
score.
but
assuming
that
such
energy
did
reached
the
city;
it
is
that
second
sale
for
resale
with
which
we
are
concerned.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that,
where
there
is
such
a
second
wholesale
sale
in
the
chain
of
sales
and
it
is
a
second
sale
for
wholesale
which,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
be
of
any
interest
to
any
other
state
than
one
so
that
there
can
be
no
so-called
multistate
interest
and
therefore,
no
national
character
to
which
one
could
ascribe
that
sale.
it
--
it
should
follow
that,
both
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
federal
power
act,
the
federal
power
commission
is
not
given
jurisdiction.
now,
in
arriving
at
the
result,
the
court
of
appeals
followed
four
simple
steps.
first
of
all,
it
noted
that
the
words
of
congress
in
section
201
(a)
are
to
the
effect
that
federal
power
commission
regulation
is
to
cover
the,
it
did
not
say
all
but
it
spoke
generically,
to
cover
the
sale
of
electric
energy
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
and
it
then
has
a
limiting
clause,
“such
federal
regulation,
however,
to
extend
only
to
those
matters
which
are
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states".
secondly,
the
ninth
circuit
examined
the
constitutional
law
and
the
decisions
which
preceded
the
enactment
of
part
ii
of
the
federal
power
act
in
1935,
and
it
ascertained
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
enactment
was
to
fill
the
gap
in
regulation
which
had
been
revealed
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
attleboro
case.
it
proceeded
to
examine
the
attleboro
case
and
to
determine
that
the
constitutional
principle
applied
by
this
court
in
that
case
was
to
ascertain
whether
the
sale
in
question
be
national
or
local
in
character
and
if
it
could
be
said
that,
if
it's
purely
local
in
character,
it
would
be
within
the
constitutional
reach
of
the
states
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation.
next,
the
court
observed
that
the
purpose
of
congress,
in
accordance
with
a
constitutional
history,
was
that
whatever
power
the
states
could
constitutionally
exercise
over
interstate
commerce
prior
to
passage
of
the
act
should
be
preserved
to
them.
it
determined
that,
factually,
this
case
involved
that
kind
and
it
put
it
--
put
to
itself
a
very
simple
question.
could
california
have
regulated
the
sale
prior
to
passage
of
the
federal
power
act?
it
had
to
answer
that
in
the
affirmative
because
it
could
find
factually
no
multistate
interest
and
it
therefore,
concluded
that,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
history
and
the
purpose
of
congress,
congress
must
have
intended
that
this
kind
of
sale
be
kept
away
from
the
--
or
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
we
think
that
logical
sequence
is
the
one
which
this
court
should
follow.
returning
now
to
the
attleboro
gap
itself
in
the
attleboro
decision,
that
case
involved
a
sale
by
a
generating
company
in
rhode
island
to
a
distributing
company
in
massachusetts.
the
sale
--
the
wholesale
sale
happened
to
be
at
the
border
of
the
two
states,
but
that
point
is
not
particularly
material
here.
it
clearly
was
a
wholesale
sale
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
clearly
involved
the
conflicting
interests
of
two
states.
the
court
weighed
the
national
versus
the
local
interest.
it
pursued
the
same
principles
of
constitutional
law
which
date
back
to
the
cooley
versus
board
of
port
wardens'
decision
of
this
court
in
1851,
and
it
determined
that,
upon
those
principles
where
there
was
a
multistate
interest,
there
could
be
no
regulation
by
the
states
--
by
the
generating
state
and
of
course,
the
same
rule
would
follow
as
to
the
distributing
state.
now,
as
the
court
stated
in
the
attleboro
case,
“the
test
of
the
validity
of
a
state
regulation
is
whether
the
particular
business
which
is
regulated
is
essentially
local
or
national
in
character”.
i
might
point
out
that
justice
brandeis
dissented
in
that
case
but
not
as
a
matter
of
principle.
he
also
accepted
the
principle
of
constitutional
law
that
you
determine
state
constitutional
power
by
determining
the
local
as
opposed
to
the
national
interest.
he
merely
reviewed
the
facts
and
determined
that
--
or
concluded
that,
in
his
view,
the
local
interest
prevailed
in
this
case.
now,
that
is
the
case
with
which
congress
was
faced
when
it
enacted
the
legislation
with
which
we
are
concerned,
part
ii
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
attleboro
case
did
not,
as
the
government
would
indicate,
hold
that
all
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce
are
automatically
excluded
from
state
constitutional
power.
indeed,
the
case
involved
a
wholesale
sale,
and
indeed
the
cases
looking
the
other
way,
where
state
jurisdiction
was
sustained
in
the
preceding
years,
did
happen
to
involve
retail
sales.
and
indeed,
it
is
perhaps
true
that
this
court
had
determined
that
generally
retail
sales
are
almost
by
definition
or
by
a
process
of
crystalizing
the
thinking
of
the
court
within
the
concept
of
local
rather
than
national
interest.
but
we
do
not
find
in
the
attleboro
decision
any
indication
or
statement
that,
as
a
cut
and
dried
part
of
a
vast
matter
all
wholesale
sales
are
national
in
character
and
the
ninth
circuit,
in
dealing
with
this
matter,
found
itself
face-to-face
with
a
case
where
the
sale
is
purely
local
in
character.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
the
rationale
of
that
case
followed
exactly
in
line,
mr.
justice
white,
with
the
thinking
of
the
attleboro
case.
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
yes.
and
--
mr.
boris
h.
lakusta
it
--
it
did
rely
upon
the
kansas
natural
case
and
it
did
find,
as
this
court
held
later
in
attleboro,
that
a
national
interest
was
involved.
now,
in
each
of
those
cases,
in
the
kansas
natural
case
and
in
the
attleboro
case,
factually,
there
certainly
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
states.
and,
it
may
--
it
may
be
fair
to
say,
that
in
the
generality
of
wholesale
sale
situations,
there
is
a
multiplicity
of
interests
between
the
states
and
therefore,
those
sales
would
fall
clearly
within
the
preview
of
the
federal
power
act
today
and
outside
of
the
constitutional
power
of
the
state.
now,
factually,
the
ninth
circuit
was
very
much
directing
its
attention
to
whether
this
particular
sale,
this
second
wholesale
sale
in
a
chain,
did
involved
the
interests
of
other
states
in
california.
the
states
of
arizona
and
nevada
were
the
only
other
two
that
couldn't
find
concern.
they
were
notified
and
informed
of
the
proceeding
before
the
power
commission,
neither
of
them
appeared,
neither
of
them
has
shown
any
direct
interest.
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
initial
sale
of
hoover
energy
to
the
edison
company
is
a
sale
under
contract
--
under
firm
contract
with
edison
and
the
other
lrts
and
that
the
allotments
are
wholly
independent
of
anything
which
edison
or
other
lrts
might
do
later
with
the
energy
once
they
receive
it.
and
also,
that
the
price
which
the
government
gets
for
the
power
is
wholly
independent
of
any
subsequent
price
which
edison
may
charge
to
the
city
of
colton.
and
the
ninth
circuit
went
on
to
say
then
that
the
initial
wholesale
sale
had
the
effect
of
protecting
the
government
completely
and
of
insulating
the
california
sales
by
edison
to
the
city
of
colton
from
any
interest
by
any
other
state.
i
don't
think
that
that
fact
can
be
controverted.
the
ninth
circuit
even
went
on
to
consider
the
possibility
of
multistate
interest
in
the
event
that
edison
might
be
selling
energy
outside
the
state
and
there
could
be
a
possibility
of
multistate
interest
there
but
upon
the
facts,
there
was
no
such
thing.
the
ninth
circuit
proceeded
to
consider
the
purpose
of
section
201
(a),
the
limitation
clause,
reserving
to
the
states
whatever
power
they
had,
and
it
was
convinced
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
keep
out
of
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
the
very
kind
of
sale
that
we
have
here
in
issue.
quoting
from
the
words
of
solicitor
evaine
who
was
a
chief
draftsman
for
the
act,
“the
wholesale
rates
governed
by
this
decision,”
and
he
was
referring
to
the
attleboro
decision,
“are
the
only
rates
which,
under
this
title,
are
to
be
fixed
by
the
power
commission.”
i
think
the
logic
of
the
position
which
the
ninth
circuit
took
is
beyond
question.
the
senate
committee
report
in
1935
made
this
remark,
“the
revision
referring
to
the
amendments
as
we
have
them
in
the
act
today
and
including
the
limitation
clause
preserving
state
authority,
the
revision
has
also
removed
every
encroachment
upon
the
authority
of
the
states.”
the
revision
referred
to
was
that
which
john
benton,
the
general
solicitor
for
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commissioners,
had
advocated
and
which
congress
subsequently
adopted.
and
it
consisted
of
the
words
which
i
have
already
quoted
namely,
“such
regulation,
however,
to
extend
only
to
those
matters
which
are
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states.”
now,
the
government
contends
that
the
words
used
by
congress
are
so
clear
that
the
matter
is
settled.
i
--
we
believe
that,
in
order
to
achieve
that
result,
the
government
strains
to
find
meaning
which
is
not
there
and
when
it
reads
the
words
in
section
201
(b)
that
power
commission
regulation
shall
extend
to,
“the
sale
of
electric
energy
of
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,”
it
in
effect,
has
to
interpolate
the
word
“every”
and
to
give
the
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
every
wholesale
sale.
and
as
we
see
it,
the
government
tries
very
hard
to
diminish
the
significance
and
indeed,
eliminate
the
significance
of
a
clause
in
the
preceding
subsection
of
the
initial
section
of
the
power
act
which
states
that
such
federal
regulation,
and
it
refers
back
in
the
same
sentence
to
wholesale
interstate
commerce
sales,
such
federal
regulation,
however,
to
extend
only
to
those
matters
which
are
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states.
now,
the
government,
in
its
argument
before
your
honors,
has
referred
to
a
number
of
decisions
and
has
quoted
language
which,
out
of
context,
appear
to
support
its
position.
we
have
examined
each
of
those
decisions
and
are
convinced
that,
in
every
case
which
has
come
before
this
court
and
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
there
was
a
multiplicity
of
state
interest,
so
that
the
rights
of
the
states,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
to
exercise
rate
regulation
did
not
exist.
this
we
believe
is
the
first
case
which
has
come
before
this
court
where,
when
it's
faced
with
the
situation
of
a
wholesale
sale
in
interstate
commerce,
where
it
is
unmistakable
that
the
interest
of
one
and
only
one
state
are
involved.
the
only
decision
which
we
find
in
conflict
with
that
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
case
of
wisconsin
versus
federal
power
commission.
that
is
a
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
that
decision
is
very
brief.
it
goes
into
no
discussion
on
the
subject
and
relies
wholly
upon
the
court
of
appeals
decision
decided
a
year
or
two
before
that,
namely
wisconsin-michigan
power
company
versus
federal
power
commission.
and
the
court
states
that
the
fact
is
strikingly
similar.
we've
examined
the
facts
in
the
two
cases
and
they
are
strikingly
dissimilar.
in
the
earlier
case,
there
was
indeed
a
multistate
interest
and
we
would
not
question
that
the
power
commission
would
have
jurisdiction
in
those
premises.
in
the
second,
there
was
no
apparent
conflict
of
interest
but
the
court
passed
the
question
off
without
really
discussing
it.
now,
that
is
the
only
decision
which
we
have
found
which
might
be
said
to
be
in
conflict.
the
commission
and
the
federal
government
have
contended,
that
unless
they
are
able
to
have
jurisdiction
over
sales
of
this
character,
in
other
words
over
all
wholesale
sales
regardless
of
the
national
or
local
interest,
their
efforts
in
administration
will
be
jeopardized.
and
they
say
that
it
is
a
simple
distinction
between
wholesale,
retail
on
the
one
hand,
and
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
distinction
to
make
between
national
and
local.
that
was
their
position
in
speaking
orally
on
this
subject
and
yet
they
have
recognized
in
their
brief
that
it
is,
in
fact,
simple
enough
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
multistate
interest.
what
they
fail
to
tell
us
is
that,
with
their
test
it
is
essential
to
have
a
case
by
case
determination
of
a
tracing
of
power
to
the
sale
in
question.
this
particular
proceeding
is
an
instance
in
point
where,
if
the
constitutional
test
which
we
advocate
had
been
applied,
this
case
probably
could've
been
disposed
of
without
going
to
hearing.
nine
days
of
hearing
were
occupied
almost
entirely
in
trying
to
trace
power
flows.
if
the
parties
had
sat
down
around
the
table
and
had
considered
whether
or
not
there
was
a
multistate
interest
or
a
purely
local
interest,
no
one
could've
questioned
that
the
interest
lay
with
california
and
that
neither
arizona
nor
nevada
nor
any
other
state
could
be
concerned.
the
government
is
suggesting
that
since
we
are
admitting
for
argument
that
interstate
sales
are
here
concerned,
therefore,
it
must
be
national
in
character.
well,
that
may
be
the
test
under
the
sherman
act,
as
the
government
states
in
its
brief.
that
certainly
is
not
the
constitutional
test
which
congress
was
thinking
about
when
it
relied
upon
the
attleboro
decision
and
the
gap
which
needed
to
be
closed
by
that
decision.
we
believe
that
this
case
represents
a
reaching
out
for
jurisdiction
in
an
area
where
no
national
interest
lies
and
where
there
is
no
evil
to
be
cured
by
the
intervention
of
the
federal
power
commission,
and
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
entirely
logical
and
is
not
only
good
law
but
good
sense.
