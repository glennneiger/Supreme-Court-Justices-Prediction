314
u.s.?
i
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
have
been
bills,
haven't
there,
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
was
the
commission
which
found
that
there
was
a
mixture
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
passed
on
either
by
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
they've
accepted
it
as
a
hypothesis
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
this
question
of
whether
or
not
some
davis
dam
power
got
into
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
southern
california
edison
company
is
the
only
private
purchaser
of
hoover
dam
power?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
private
companies
in
arizona
and
nevada
buy
it
from
the
state-created
identities?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
colton
sells
this
electric
power
to
--
at
retail,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
some
householder's
meter
begins
running
too
fast,
it's
colton,
he
calls
up,
doesn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
may
make
a
mistake
and
call
the
wrong
person,
but
isn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
we
would
get
in
--
we
would
not
get
into
this
as
a
factual
question
at
all,
here
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case.
but
if
--
but
only
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
then
this
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals.
would
it,
in
your
view
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
any
interstate
power
as
the
source
of
the
electricity
sold
by
the
city
of
colton?
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
found
that
there
was
an
interstate
source,
clearly,
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
without
deciding
that
there
was
hoover
dam
energy
sold
to
colton.
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
ground,
you
say,
is
correct
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
well,
they're
both
--
but,
as
i
understood
it,
it
only
decided
one.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
but
now,
if
by
chance,
this
court
should
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
the
ground
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
its
case
was
erroneous,
in
your
view,
what
should
this
court
do?
justice
potter
stewart
to
where,
to
the
commission?
do
you
think
the
commission
acted
improperly?
justice
potter
stewart
in
--
in
finding
--
to
the
extent
that
we
should
remand
it
to
the
commission
to
reconsider
the
question
of
the
source
of
the
power?
justice
potter
stewart
or
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
