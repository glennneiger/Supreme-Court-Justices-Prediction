mr.
s.
del
fuston
my
name
is
fuston
sir,
it's
a
common
mistake.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
case
involved
in
preemption
that
arose
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
it's
a
case
where
peaceful
picketing
was
enjoined
by
a
state
court
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute
and
no
interstate
commerce
involved.
the
separate
injunction
was
made
permanent.
the
case
was
duly
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eastern
section
of
tennessee.
the
case,
after
have
been
for
some
time,
it
was
affirmed
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
fortified
but
then
holding
that
the
construction
project
was
completed
and
the
case
was
moved.
we
get
to
the
certiorari
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
the
certiorari
was
denied
and
within
certiorari,
the
case
to
this
honorable
court.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
that
precipitated
this
had
been
occurred
as
follows.
the
chattanooga
building
trades
is
composed
of
all
the
craft
unions
and
it
is
interested
all
craft
unions
are
in
getting
all
the
work
possible
for
its
members.
they
knew
back
in
1960,
that
jafco,
was
going
to
build
a
huge
shopping
center
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
tennessee.
it
would
cover
several
--
equivalent
of
several
city
blocks.
it
would
have
many
tenants
including
a
bank,
bowling
alley,
chain
stores
and
whatnot.
the
unions
carefully
awaited
to
see
who
the
prime
contractor
would
be
and
finally,
it
was
announced
that
the
rea
construction
company
would
be
the
prime
contractor
and
they
learned
that
the
rea
construction
company
was
from
charlotte,
north
carolina.
as
in
all
this
type
of
cases
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
chattanooga
building
trades
then
called
the
charlotte
building
trades,
trying
to
find
out
something
about
this
contractor.
usually,
they
get
an
answer
that
a
contractor
is
what
they
call
a
fair
contractor
or
employs
union
man
or
he
employs
non-union
man
or
a
combination
of
some
kind.
and
they
were
informed
on
this
particular
occasion,
that
the
jones
family
had
two
corporations.
one
was
called
the
a.j.
jones
construction
company
which
was
union.
they
also
had
a
sister
corporation
called
the
rea
construction
company
which
was
strictly
nonunion.
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
learned
that
it
would
be
the
nonunion
corporation
that
had
gotten
this
particular
job
and
soon
after
work
started,
the
chattanooga
building
trades
considered
putting
a
picket
on
the
job
to
every
task,
the
fact
that
it
was
nonunion
to
advertise
about
their
working
conditions.
but
before
they
did,
a
business
agent
for
the
hod-carriers
union
with
by
the
construction
site
and
talked
to
some
of
the
laborers
working
there.
they
were
in
the
rough
stages
at
that
time,
bulldozing
and
such.
the
laborers
said,
"mr.
elkins,
we're
only
getting
a
dollar
in
a
half
an
hour
on
this
job.
can't
you
please
do
something
for
us?"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
will
see
what
can
be
done."
he
then
went
to
the
chattanooga
building
trades,
he
learned
that
they
had
already
considered
placing
a
picket
on
the
job
and
the
next
day,
one
picket
arrived
and
again,
patrolling
the
area.
but
in
just
a
few
minutes,
after
the
picketing
had
begun,
the
picketing
was
stopped
by
an
ex
parte
injunction
issued
by
a
state
chancery
court.
we
duly
file
a
motion
to
have
the
case
dissolved.
one
of
the
defenses
was
the
doctrine
of
preemption
based
upon
this
court's
decision
of
san
diego
versus
garmon
and
other
relevant
cases.
at
the
show
course
here
and
the
judge
that
had
issued
an
injunction,
had
another
judge
to
set
for
him
here
and
this
judge
refused
to
resolve
the
injunction
until
it
final
hearing.
we
had
the
final
hearing
and
the
judge
at
that
time
had
a
lengthy
opinion,
held
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute
by
any
stretch
of
imagination.
he
held
that
interstate
commerce
was
not
involved.
he
cited
absolutely
a
no
authorities,
no
decisions,
nothing.
the
only
decision
that
is
decided
--
that
is
cited
in
his
entire
opinion
is
a
case
involving
intrastate
commerce
that
is
not
even
relevant
to
the
case
here.
the
very
next
day,
we
had
this
case
on
the
road
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
filed
a
motion
in
that
court
to
move
the
case
up
because
we
were
afraid
that
the
construction
project
would
be
completed
and
we
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
have
our
case
determined.
the
court
of
appeals
listened
to
us
and
then
announced
that
they
would
not
move
the
case
up
on
the
docket.
later,
the
case
came
home
for
hearing
in
its
regular
term
and
we
ordered
the
case
at
which
then
the
court
wanted
to
know
when
the
construction
project
would
be
over.
and
both
counsel
for
the
defendants
and
counsel
for
myself
and
asked
to
the
court
that
duty
in
here,
the
lace
whether
one
thing
or
another,
it'd
be
a
several
weeks
before
the
work
would
be
over.
the
court
of
appeals
then
held
the
case
from
september
until
the
following
january
and
then
adopted
the
trial
court's
decision
verbatim
and
also
added
that
the
case
was
moot
because
the
project
had
just
been
completed
at
that
time.
and,
we
say
if
the
court
please,
that
the
case
is
not
moot
that
there
was
a
labor
dispute
and
that
interstate
commerce
was
involved.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
--
of
marine
engineers
versus
the
interlake
steamship
company
is
controlling
as
to
these
terms,
as
true
that
the
--
this
court's
opinion
was
not
available
at
that
time,
i
think
it
was
two
or
three
months
after
this
decision
was
written
when
this
court
acted
in
that
case.
but
i
used
the
precise
language
as
identical
in
all
my
pleadings
and
it
was
the
argument
that
i
had
made
to
each
court
and
that
is
that
the
definitions
of
the
terms
under
national
labor
relations
act
should
be
left
to
the
tribunal
that
congress
has
chosen
to
administer
the
act.
and
this
court
held
that
in
the
interlake
case
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
--
that
the
words
or
labor
organizations
defined
by
the
act
and
the
state
courts
have
no
right
to
interpret
that.
it
should
go
to
the
n.l.r.b.
since
that
time
and
since
that
--
since
i've
written
my
brief,
there's
been
another
case
by
this
court.
it's
a
local
1207,
bridge
workers
versus
perko,
decided
this
summer
and
the
opinioned
by
his
honor,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
it
follows
the
interlake
case
and
says
that,
"an
employee
which
defined
by
the
act,
should
be
left
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
a
case
of
reasonable
argument
is
made
to
that
effect."
that
seems
highly
illogical
to
us
that
you
should
say
that
certain
words
that
are
defined
in
the
act
should
be
left
to
the
tribunal
that
has
been
chosen
to
administer
the
act
and
that
in
this
case,
to
say
that
other
definitions
appear
in
the
act
should
not
be
left
to
the
same
tribunal,
and
that
would
be
labor
dispute
which
is
defined
by
the
act
and
it
would
also
be
commerce
as
defined
by
the
act.
in
this
particular
case,
the
complaint
was
that
we
were
picketing
to
cause
a
breach
of
contracts
between
these
jafco
corporation
and
rea
construction
company
or
the
rea
construction
company
and
--
and
with
other
companies
has
been
one
of
the
--
that
business
has
been
raised
time
and
time
again.
and
in
fact
that
we
had
a
great
deal
--
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
that
argument
until
the
so-called
landrum-griffin
amendments
to
the
taft-hartley
laws
were
paced
in
1959.
the
court,
i'm
sure,
will
recall
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(1),
was
left
the
same
but
a
new
section
was
added
which
is
8
(b)
(4)
(ii).
and
the
(ii)
section
says
that
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
so
many
words,
if
you
attempt
to
cause
a
cessation
of
business
between
one
person
and
another
is
very
much
more
broad
than
just
causing
a
breach
of
contract.
you
can
have
a
situation
where
two
people
just
deal
with
each
other
without
a
written
contract
and
it
could
be
unfair
labor
practice.
and
we
say
that,
even
if
we
take
the
statements
that
they
say
are
true
in
their
bill
or
complaint,
that
it
is
a
matter
they
discovered
by
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
of
the
act.
of
course,
we
contend
that
it's
protected
activity
under
section
7
of
the
act.
and
we
say
if
the
court
please,
that
the
interlake
case
and
the
perko
cases
are
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
issue
should
be
left
to
the
n.l.r.b.
we
went
ahead
and
actually
proved
the
time
of
trial
--
time
came
around
that
rea
construction
company
was
involved
in
interstate
commerce
and
just
on
this
one
project
alone,
that
it
purchased
materials
from
outside
state,
mine
to
at
least
three
times.
the
jurisdiction
or
requirements
set
by
the
--
by
the
n.l.r.b.
and
which
was
frozen
by
the
landrum-griffin
acts
of
1959.
but
the
court
just
ignored
it
and
referred
to
those
facts
and
referred
to
no
decisions.
we
beg
if
the
court
please
that
the
big
question
that
we
have
here
today
is
this
question
of
mootness.
it's
a
question
that
hovers
over
every
one
of
these
cases
where
you
have
a
construction
project
because
at
sometime,
you
don't
know
exactly
when
a
construction
project
is
going
to
be
completed.
if
the
state
court
takes
juris
--
jurisdiction
which
we
say
is
illegal
and
arbitrary,
we
--
there
is
nothing,
we're
powerless
to
do
anything
and
we
can't
do
anything
except
take
it
up
to
the
state
courts.
and
you
usually
get
best
so
far
as
your
court
of
appeals
in
your
state,
when
the
project
is
completed,
if
you
get
that
fat
at
all,
and
that
court
acts
and
thereafter,
you
can't
go
to
your
state
supreme
court.
it's
--
they
say,
“well,
the
construction
project
is
over
the
question
is
moot,
we
will
not
hear
you.”
now,
we
say
that
the
question
is
not
moot
for
three
reasons.
in
the
very
first
case
that
arose
under
the
act,
my
law
partner
mr.
king
who
was
here
yesterday
and
introduced
me
held
before
the
board,
that
case
by
different
rounds
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
where
we
got
a
ruling
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
under
watson
versus
wilson,
it
also
went
the
board
route
through
the
sixth
circuit
to
this
honorable
court,
for
we
had
decision
or
other
issues.
but
the
facts
in
that
case
were
briefly
this.
they
had
a
speculative
contractor
in
chattanooga
who
was
building
houses
and
the
unions,
the
chattanooga
building
trades
and
especially
the
carpenters
decided
to
put
a
picket
on
one
of
these
construction
projects.
and
on
the
day
before
the
1947
act
went
into
effect,
picketing
stopped
and
the
next
day,
the
prime
contractor
went
to
the
board
wanting
a
cease-and-desist
order.
and
based
upon
those
facts,
this
court
held
in
the
first
case
that
it
could
have
acted
on
a
state
of
facts
similar
to
what
we
have
here
today,
that
the
underlying
dispute
had
not
been
resolved
and
therefore,
the
board
was
entitled
to
the
injunction.
now
here,
we
come
here
several
years
later
and
the
--
she
was
on
the
under
court.
we
think
that
at
this
time
since
the
matter
is
arguably
before
the
board
in
the
first
place
and
since
the
underlying
dispute
has
never
been
resolved,
that
for
that
reason,
the
case
is
not
moot.
another
case
that
somewhat
similar
to
it
was
a
case
that
we
did
not
have
at
the
time
that
we
order
a
brief
which
was
decided
this
summer
by
this
court
is
the
case
of
--
division
1287
street
electric
and
motor
coach
employees
versus
missouri
and
the
case
was
written
--
the
opinion
is
written
by
his
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
in
that
case
as
we
read
it,
there
was
an
act
by
the
governor
of
missouri
and
they
had
action
in
the
state
court
and
this
--
in
the
state
--
the
court
states
that
the
very
threshold
meant
with
the
--
with
the
question
of
mootness.
and
because
where
time
that
the
case
got
to
this
honorable
court,
the
governor
had
removed
his
authority
and
taken
over
the
--
the
business
of
public
utility
in
--
in
that
state.
and
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
again
stated
no
less
than
three
months
ago,
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
the
underlying
dispute
had
not
been
resolved
between
the
parties.
and
we
say
for
that
reason
that
the
case
was
not
moot.
for
our
second
reason,
we
say
this,
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes
if
the
court
pleases.
this
particular
company
is
making
bids
on
all
of
the
projects
in
the
same
area
and
in
their
sworn
petition
to
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
which
we
have
set
out
in
the
record
here,
the
appropriate
official
of
the
union
stated
that
he
--
that
it
was
--
the
desire
of
his
union
to
picket
the
same
company
under
the
same
facts,
under
the
same
factual
situation,
but
he
would
be
prevented
doing
so
unless
he
received
relief
through
the
courts
or
for
this
reason
if
the
court
please,
if
the
rea
construction
company
gets
another
project,
decided
to
put
on
an
informational
picket,
goes
before
the
--
same
judge,
you
can
only
expect
the
same
decision,
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
project
is
completed
and
you
got
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
it
would
be
or
another
--
on
another
project
just
as
it
would
be
in
case
number
one
if
the
court
please,
in
the
watson
case
or
the
carpenters
case
as
it's
down
here
at
local
74
versus
carpenters
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
because
this
man
was
a
speculative
builder,
building
houses.
and
when
he
complete
at
the
house
or
the
house
was
completed,
he
had
to
go
somewhere
other
--
lot
to
build
a
house
but
this
court
said
that,
“you
still
have
the
same
dispute
that
existed.”
mr.
s.
del
fuston
that
is
the
question
that
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to.
it
probably
--
probably
wouldn't
but
you
could
expect
the
same
result.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
it
is.
i
do
know
this
but
i
thought
it
was
so
broad
at
that
time
that
this
construction
was
going
over
--
going
on,
that
the
carpenters
had
a
dispute
with
the
--
runs
with
people
out
of
some
state
in
regard
to
the
bowling
alleys
and
i
feel
at
that
time
that
the
injunction
was
so
far
reaching
that
they
could
not
place
a
picket
on
the
job.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
if
the
court
please,
and
we
think
that's
--
another
reason
we
think
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
there's
been
considerable
court
cost
in
this
case
that
--
that
it
will
have
to
be
borne
by
the
losing
party.
there
are
attorney's
fees
and
other
things
of
that
nature
involved
and
we
think
for
that
reason,
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
if
the
court
please
and
there's
a
dispute
of
authority
as
to
what
your
action
is
in
case
the
court
issued
an
injunction
where
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
there's
no
reason
--
case
since
--
i
think
after
1900
on
that
proposition.
the
whole
cases
are
very
much
in
dispute
only.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
the
record
if
the
court
please,
is
only
in
our
sworn
petition
because
at
the
--
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
decided,
the
case
was
not
moved
actually
--
and
did
--
actually,
there
were
some
painting
and
--
and
more
--
more
things
going
on
at
this
building
project
and
lasted
about
a
week.
but
we
do
that
--
that
time
we
got
a
petition
back
to
the
court,
it
wouldn't
be
completed.
so
in
our
sworn
petition
to
the
supreme
court
which
is
for
this
record,
oath
was
made
that
--
that
the
same
thing
would
occur
all
over
again
and
it
was
our
desire
to
picket
the
same
company
under
same
--
under
similar
circumstances
in
the
future.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes
it
was.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes
and
it
amazes
me
how
quick
they've
got
that
out.
it
must
have
been
prepared
in
offense
because
the
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
live
in
chattanooga,
the
courthouses
in
another
county
some
30
miles
away,
the
judge
lives,
we
have
the
circuit
in
another
county
and
i
think
that
picket
stayed
out
there
about
10
minutes.
somehow
the
--
the
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
when
it
got
to
the
hands
of
the
--
of
the
judge.
it
was
signed,
it
was
in
the
clerk's
officers
--
offices
and
the
--
sheriff
was
out
there
within
15
minutes
after
the
picket
got
there.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
i
assume
that
he
did.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
that
is
really
the
concern
we
were
picketing.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
no,
that's
from
charlotte,
north
carolina.
it
has
branch
offices
in
orlando.
it's
a
big
construction
company.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
it
was
in
for
this
one
job
of
this
particular
time.
i
know
--
do
know
they
were
bitting
on
a
railroad
job
whether
they
got
in
that,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
all
i
know
is
that
at
the
time
they
were
bidding
those
some
--
other
jobs
--
jobs
in
that
area.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
in
chattanooga
and
within
an
area
of
--
100
miles
around
chattanooga.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
it
was.
the
--
as
far
as
the
desire
to
picket
this
company
in
the
future.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
it
is
in
the
--
in
the
record
and
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
i'll
try
to
find
it
when
opposing
counsel
is
--
i
will
take
i
guess
a
little
time
--
i
guess
--
i'll
believe,
i'll
be
able
to
do
it
just
two
or
three
minutes
so.
we
think
for
another
reason
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
sir.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
i
forgot
your
honor.
i'll
be
glad
to
check
that
out
too.
i
know
that
it's
your
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
the
entire
record
is
here.
besides
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
no,
i
haven't.
the
only
case
i
did
make
inquiry
of
some
other
attorneys
throughout
the
country,
i
thought
that
might
have
had
such
a
case
here
and
the
nearest
case
that
i
had
on
this
mootness
question
was
the
one
presented
by
dave
privett
on
milwaukee
in
the
county
of
door
case
which
i
have
also
said
in
my
brief.
and
i
think
it's
under
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
the
question
in
that
particular
case
from
what
mr.
friedman
tells
me
and
the
question
was
raised
but
there's
nothing
in
the
decision
of
this
court
concerning
the
mootness?
mr.
s.
del
fuston
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
it's
--
it's
set
forth
in
my
table
of
cases
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
--
county
of
door
--
it's
350
--
9
u.s.
15,
i'm
sorry
your
honor
it's
a
wrong
turn
there.
now,
there's
another
that
we
have
in
this
case
that
has
not
been
presented
as
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
we'd
have
to
sue
on
that
one?
mr.
s.
del
fuston
it's
my
understanding
your
honor.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
but
we
are
going
to
make
that
claim.
that
is
another
question
that
hasn't
been
determined
in
years
in
our
--
in
our
state.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
yes.
it
is
in
--
in
the
record.
now,
there's
another
--
a
reason
if
the
court
please
that
we
think
that
--
that
the
case
has
not
moot
and
that
is
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
we
have
a
declaratory
judgment
statute.
that
clearly,
a
higher
court
has
the
right
to
review
any
question
and
give
her
advisory
opinion.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eastern
section
had
said
the
case
is
moot,
we
refuse
to
consider
it
any
further,
that
would
have
been
one
day.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
case
is
moot
but
in
spite
of
it
being
moot,
we
hold
that
this
picketing
was
illegal
and
they
made
some
more
statements
about
it
and
then
they
stated
that
they
adopted
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
right
to
give
an
advisory
opinion
and
certainly,
it
seems
to
us
that
a
higher
court
has
the
privilege
to
redo
that
advisory
opinion
as
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
they
gave
the
correct
advisory
opinion
and
we
say
for
that
reason,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
in
short,
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
this
as
a
case
as
very
similar
to
all
these
picketing
cases
that
we
have
involved
in
construction
projects.
we
have
this
--
this
question
of
mootness
always
hovering
over
and
because
we
can't
get
them
up
fast
enough.
for
example,
in
about
three
weeks
i
think
that
you'll
have
the
--
keep
your
birthday
of
garner
versus
teamsters
as
i
recall,
it
was
about
the
middle
of
december
1953
when
this
court
rendered
the
opinion
on
rather
famous
case
now.
i
know
i
was
in
charlotte,
north
carolina
on
that
occasion
or
in
the
--
the
same
kind
of
case
before
the
superior
court
in
charlotte,
north
carolina.
and
if
you
will
look
on
the
date
that
the
--
that
the
garner
versus
teamsters
case
came
out,
you'll
find
that
it
made
the
headlines
in
the
charlotte
observer.
and
i
was
eating
my
lunch
and
i
had
the
case
argued
about
this
time
of
the
day
and
i
was
arguing
the
case
of
preemption
to
the
--
to
the
superior
court
there
where
they
were
building
the
airport
and
argued
it
with
the
newspaper
in
my
hand.
the
opinion
i
got
from
the
charlotte
paper
was
very
short
but
i
was
familiar
with
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
it
stated
in
the
article
that
--
that
that
court
had
been
affirmed
and
i
was
arguing
that
was
the
--
that
was,
i
had
that
case
and
--
a
case
of
oliver
versus
(inaudible)
of
tennessee.
i
think
that
tennessee
supreme
court
actually
was
the
first
state
court
from
my
research
that
written
as
a
doctrine
of
preemption.
and
with
those
two
cases
and
with
the
newspaper
clipping
that
i
had,
i
was
arguing
preemption
to
that
court
down
there.
as
soon
as
i
got
to
of
to
the
argument,
i
felt
pretty
good.
i
wanted
to
stand
up
and
get
the
decision
of
this
court,
have
it
flown
back
in
for
the
--
for
the
trial
judge
the
next
day.
and
if
you'll
read
the
next
issue
of
the
charlotte
observer,
you
will
see
that
this
judge
granted
the
injunction
with
the
remarks,
"mr.
fuston,
i
going
to
grant
the
injunction
in
this
case
and
you
can
take
me
to
the
supreme
court
and
reverse
me."
but
in
the
meantime,
our
airport
will
be
built.
and
he
was
absolutely
right
because
at
all
of
these
cases,
you
have
this
question
of
whether
or
not
you
can
get
a
case
up
to
a
higher
court
before
the
project
is
completed.
now,
we
say
if
the
court
please,
that
on
a
basis
of
the
decision
of
this
court
since
the
garner
case
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eastern
section
of
tennessee
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
unfortunately,
i
wasn't
able
to
find
the
page
in
the
credit
record
up
to
where
the
state
was
made
that
we
desired
to
picket
the
same
company
in
the
future.
i
do
know
it
was
made
on
page
15
of
my
brief
before
this
court.
i
made
the
statement
it
is
the
desire
the
petitioners
to
picket
the
respondents
of
the
future
of
the
same
omission
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
that
is
it
and
mr.
raymond
floyd
made
oath
to
that,
i
remember
that.
mr.
s.
del
fuston
that
is
--
mr.
s.
del
fuston
that's
what
i
have
reference
to
your
honor.
i
believe
i
haven't
my
argument
unless
the
court
desires
to
ask
some
further
questions.
