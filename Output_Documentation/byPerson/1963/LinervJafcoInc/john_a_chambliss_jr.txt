mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
to
talk,
i
would
like
to
say
something.
this
is
indeed
a
small
world.
this
is
the
first
time
i've
had
occasion
to
come
before
this
court
and
one
of
the
cases
this
morning
came
from
the
court
of
claims
on
which
my
uncle
sam
whittaker
has
become
a
fixture
and
it
was
very
interesting
and
difficult
case.
the
other
one
came
from
louisiana
where
my
wife
was
born,
where
i
visit
frequently.
and
i
couldn't
but
think
as
i
listen
to
that
case
on
the
fact
that
although
i'm
not
a
chinese,
i
have
a
chinese
godson
in
hong
kong
and
should
he
wish
to
run
from
office
in
louisiana,
i
would
hate
to
think
that
he
would
have
to
designate
himself
as
a
mongoloid.
now,
with
those
remarks
back,
i
mean,
i
will
turn
to
discussion
of
the
case
at
bar.
the
most
delicious
part
of
having
a
case
before
this
court
is
that
as
my
friend
and
hero,
mr.
justice
vanderbilt
once
said,
"this
court
is
of
necessity
more
interested
in
what
the
law
ought
to
be
than
in
what
the
law
is,
not
own
any
purely
ad
hoc
basis
but
on
the
basis
of
our
scheme
of
ordered
liberty."
now,
law
is
of
course
a
substitute
for
warfare.
it
is
the
modern
equivalent
of
war,
we
hope.
and
you
are
of
course
interested
in
the
rights
of
people
and
we
remember
it
all
the
times
that
one's
rights
end
where
one's
wrongs
begin.
this
court
has
very
difficult
cases
to
hear
and
to
decide.
in
this
matter
of
peaceful
picketing
for
example,
it
was
first
held
by
this
court
that
peaceful
picketing
was
tantamount
to
free
speech
and
then
it
was
later
recognized
that
that
was
not
true,
that
peaceful
picketing
is
more
than
free
speech.
now,
the
case
we
have
here
today
does
not
involve
a
claim
of
the
right
of
picketing
on
the
ground
of
free
speech.
it
involves
rather
only
the
issue
of
preemption.
that
is
the
only
thing
involved
here
and
it's
based
upon
such
cases
as
the
san
diego
building
trades
council
case,
the
engineers
association
case
and
the
current
case
from
atlanta
which
is
very
close
to
kin
to
the
case
at
bar,
but
is
quite
distinguishable.
all
of
these
cases
held,
that
a
situation
that
is
arguably
one
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
must
be
handled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
it's
true
that
the
engineers
association
case
went
a
bit
further
than
that,
by
saying
that
it
must
be
reasonably
arguable.
now
in
this
case,
we
think
that
it
is
not
reasonably
arguable.
one
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
jafco
wished
to
build
a
$2
million
shopping
center
in
cleveland,
tennessee.
they
made
a
contract
with
rea
construction
company
of
north
carolina
to
do
the
job
and
this
is
a
company
that
operates
on
an
open
shop
basis.
it
is
not
nonunion,
it
is
not
union,
it
is
on
open
shop
basis,
this
appears
in
the
record.
rea
construction
company
in
turn,
contracted
with
the
(inaudible)
to
do
the
grading
on
the
job
and
they
went
out
there
with
this
heavy
earth
moving
equipment
to
do
the
grading
on
the
job.
a
picket
was
placed,
one
single
peaceful
picket,
bearing
a
sign
in
which
it
is
stated,
on
which
it
was
stated,
"rea
construction
company
not
under
contract
with
chattanooga
building
trades
council,
rea
construction
company
not
under
contract
with
chattanooga
building
trades
council.”
now,
that
picket
was
not
removed
in
a
manner
of
minutes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
picket
got
there,
my
associate
counsel
in
cleveland
called
me,
came
down
to
chattanooga
and
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
not
until
a
day
later
that
we
were
able
to
get
the
bills
on
and
go
the
chancellor.
we
went
to
the
chancellor
because
we
felt
on
the
basis
of
what
we
could
see
with
our
eyes
and
incidentally
after
that
picket
was
placed
immediately,
all
of
these
union
heavy
equipment
people
walked
off
the
job.
the
lewis
brothers
people
left
because
they
were
afraid
not
to.
they
were
afraid
of
reprisal
and
the
whole
job
was
shutdown.
the
job
had
a
deadline,
it
had
a
time
limit
and
the
whole
thing
was
shutdown
completely.
we
filed
this
bill
in
chancery
and
in
tennessee,
we
still
have
separate
courts
of
chancery
and
law
and
we
sought
an
injunction
because
we
say
that
the
picketing
was
seeking
a
breach
of
a
contract
that
existed
between
other
people.
and
there,
you
see
statute
in
tennessee
that
provides
that
that
is
unlawful
and
provides
treble
damages
therefore.
we
also
said
that
this
picketing
sought
to
effect
a
violation
of
the
tennessee
right-to-work
law,
such
as
was
insisted
in
the
curry
case,
because
in
tennessee
it
is
illegal
to
distinguish
between
union
and
nonunion
employees.
we
also
ask
damages
for
what
we
regarded
as
the
illegal
picketing.
and
in
the
course
of
our
bill,
we
charged
in
paragraph
7
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute
in
existence
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
that
has
never
been
determined
your
honor,
because
they
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
still
open.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
still
open.
we
were
--
the
court
of
appeals
may
it
please
the
court,
stated
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
damages
because
they
said
it
was
malicious
under
all
the
circumstances
and
facts
to
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
my
mistake.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anything.
i
would
not
insist
in
the
mootness
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
no,
sir.
now,
the
answer
in
this
case,
the
answer
in
this
case
did
not
--
did
not
reply
at
all
to
this
question
of
whether
there
was
a
labor
dispute.
in
our
chancery
procedure
down
there,
we
state
our
points
paragraph-by-paragraph
and
they're
answered
paragraph-by-paragraph.
in
the
answer
in
this
case,
they
completely
ignored
the
charge
that
there
was
no
labor
dispute.
they
just
did
not
answer
that
at
all.
they
did
deny
in
their
answer
that
they
were
seeking
to
affect
a
breach
of
a
contract.
they
said,
“we're
not
interested
in
affecting
a
breach
of
contract.
they
did
deny
that
they
were
seeking
to
have
union
people
hired.
they
said,
“we're
not
seeking
to
have
union
people
hired
there.”
they
asserted
and
this
is
on
page
14
of
the
transcript.
they
asserted
this,
"these
defendants
which
show
to
the
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
is
to
inform
members
of
organized
labor
in
cleveland
and
vicinity,
sympathizers
of
the
labor
movement
and
the
public
in
general,
that
the
complainant's
project
is
not
under
contract
with
appropriate
bargaining
labor
organizations.
the
effect
that
is
sought
is
that
persons
who
hire
contractors
hereafter.”
i
remind
--
i
remind
you,
this
is
their
sworn
answer.
this
is
all
they
were
seeking.
the
effect
that
is
sought
is
that
persons
who
hire
contractors,
hereafter,
will
know
which
are
union
contractors
and
which
are
not.
if
those
people
desire
to
hire
such
contractors
as
complainants,
they're
so
informed.
now,
that
was
their
answer.
we
then
took
the
discovery
deposition
of
the
leader
of
the
defendant
group
because
we
wanted
to
pin
down
just
what
the
purpose
of
this
picketing
was
and
so
we
took
the
discovery
deposition
of
one
c
earl
williams.
he
is
the
same
person
who
had
sworn
to
this
answer.
and
the
reason
we
wanted
to
pin
him
down
was
this,
my
opponent
--
and
i
have
been
going
around
and
around
in
this
field
for
some
years,
we're
a
little
bit
like
tony
canzoneri
and
barney
ross
use
to
be.
and
he
adverted
to
the
watson
case
which
was
my
case
and
to
the
carpenters
case
which
came
up
here
and
that
was
my
case
and
we
had
another
case
down
there
a
few
years
ago,
in
which
again
at
cleveland,
tennessee,
a
picket
was
placed
which
forced
the
breach
of
a
contract
between
a
nonunion
contractor
whom
i
represented
and
the
people
who're
having
the
job
done,
and
the
job
was
taken
from
my
man
and
was
given
to
a
union
contractor
and
my
man
then
brought
suit
and
we
tried
the
case,
and
my
man
collected
treble
damages
for
they're
having
done
this
to
him.
and
they
were
very
anxious
to
avoid
getting
themselves
in
the
position
of
again
being
liable
for
treble
damages,
and
so
they
made
it
very
play
in
their
answer
and
then
their
sworn
testimony,
that
they
were
not
seeking
a
contract.
in
fact
they
said,
“we're
not
seeking
anything.
we
don't
want
anything.
we
have
no
dispute
with
these
people.”
and
that
is
the
literal
language
of
the
chief
defendant
here.
we
have
no
dispute
with
these
people,
we
don't
want
anything,
we
don't
want
a
contract,
we
don't
want
to
bargain
with
them
about
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
we
don't
want
anything.
now,
when
i
took
his
deposition
on
page
54
and
58,
59
and
60
of
the
record,
i
asked
him
this,
i
said,
“did
you
have
any
interest
in
whether
jafco
had
a
contract
use
union
labor
our
interest
was
that?”
“yes,
sir.”
question
-
“did
you
do
anything
about
it?”
“no
sir.”
“did
you
take
any
action
at
all
with
reference
to
jafco
and
his
job
up
here
that
was
being
done?”
answer
-
“i
don't
know
what
you
mean
find
the
action.
do
you
mean
that
i
came
and
talked
to
jafco?”
question
-
“did
you
come
or
anyone
else
from
the
labor
organization
come
that
you
know
of?”
answer
-
“i
don't
know,
i
didn't
come
and
talk
to
any
body.”
question
-
“do
you
know
of
anyone
else
who
did?”
answer
-
“i
don't
know.
no,
sir.”
then
again,
he
--
he
said
that
he
was
unhappy
because
they
were
paying
a
certain
rate
and
i
said
to
him,
“did
you
say
on
your
picket
sign
or
did
you
do
anything
about
advertising
the
rates
they
were
paying?”
no.
i
said,
“your
only
sign
there
now
was
that
they're
not
under
contract,
you
said
yes.
and
that
they
were
interested
in
--
if
advertising
to
people
that
we
hooked
on
future
contracts,
similar
jobs
that
it
would
have
an
effect.”
now,
he
--
he,
therefore,
skirting
around
the
question
of
seeking
anything
which
of
course
was
involved
in
the
curry
case
directly,
i
mean,
they
were
seeking
something.
they
frankly
admitted
that
they
have
a
labor
dispute.
the
union
had
gone
to
see
the
employer
and
they
--
they
have
a
labor
dispute
there.
but
in
this
instance,
there
wasn't
any
that
--
of
that.
now,
after
this
discovery
deposition
was
taken
and
before
the
trial,
opposing
counsel,
on
behalf
the
union,
wrote
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
asked
if
they
would
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
like
that,
and
the
board
replied
that
they
didn't
know
whether
they
would
allow
it.
now
on
the
basis
of
all
of
this,
our
tennessee
courts
then
proceeded
to
hold
that
first,
there
was
no
labor
dispute.
second,
that
the
picketing
was
an
unwarranted
interference
since
the
picketing
people
sought
no
gain
from
the
thing
at
all,
as
far
as
these
people
were
concerned,
that
it
was
unwarranted
interference.
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
case
had
become
moot.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes
sir
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
your
honor
please,
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
opinion
went
beyond
there.
this
is
on
page
98
and
it
says
this,
"defendants
say
that
when
they
placed
this
picket
on
the
line,
it
was
merely
to
education.
we
cannot
accept
that
explanation
which
does
not
explain.
they
knew
that
when
this
picket
was
placed
at
this
entrance
to
the
work
that
it
would
result
in
union
employees
refusing
to
cross
the
line
and
this
is
exactly
what
happen
thus
causing
a
complete
work
stoppage."
in
short,
we
find
that
the
action
of
the
defendants
was
frightful
and
malicious
and
in
an
attempt
to
injure
both
jafco
incorporated
and
rea
construction
company.
what
has
been
said
requires
the
affirmance
of
the
decree
below
with
cost
against
the
appellants
and
surety
on
appeal
bond.
your
honor
please,
they
do
not
specifically
say
that
we
could
collect
damages.
i
thought
that
they
did,
but
there's
no
language
in
their
and
i
think
that
perhaps
we
could
not
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that
your
honor
is
probably
correct.
i've
been
under
the
impression
that
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
be
remanded
for
the
question
of
damages,
but
they
did
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
distinguish
just
very
briefly,
this
--
this
curry
opinion
which
mr.
justice
white
handed
down
last
january.
in
that
case,
the
unions
involved
visited
the
respondents.
in
other
words,
they
went
to
see
them.
they
talked
to
them
about
the
situation.
according
to
the
respondents,
the
union
urged
the
hiring
of
union
personnel.
now,
according
to
the
union
that
was
not
so.
they
say
that
they
requested
them
to
raise
the
pay
scale.
but
in
any
event,
there
was
a
communication.
there
was
a
demand
any
refusal
so
to
speak
and
there
was
a
labor
dispute.
now
then,
the
lower
court
of
course
denied
an
injunction
on
the
ground
of
preemption
as
it
turned
down
ultimately
properly
so.
the
georgia
supreme
court
reversed
and
then
this
court
held
that
there
was
an
arguable
case
there
of
jurisdiction
for
the
national
labor
relations
board,
a
reasonably
arguable
case.
now,
what
is
a
labor
dispute?
in
our
brief
which
is
extremely
brief,
on
page
2,
i
quote
the
act
itself.
and
this
is
what
the
act
says
is
a
labor
dispute
and
we
say
it
does
not
fit
the
situation,
"any
controversy
concerning
terms,
tenure
or
conditions
of
employment
or
concerning
the
association
or
representation
of
persons
in
negotiating,
fixing,
maintaining
changing
or
seeking
to
arrange
terms
or
conditions
of
employment,
regardless
of
whether
the
dispute
in
stand
in
approximate
relationship
of
employer
and
employee."
now,
we
say
that,
that
just
doesn't
fit
here.
they
were
not
interested,
there
was
no
controversy,
you
don't
controvert
with
someone
that
you
have
no
contact
with.
you
make
no
demands
upon.
there's
no
controversy
there.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
labor
dispute
there.
now,
had
they
chosen
to
stand,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
what
their
picket
sign
said,
rea
construction
company,
not
under
contract
with
chattanooga
building
trades
council?”
then,
it
would
have
been
a
picketing
for
representation
for
a
union
contract
and
that
obviously,
would
have
made
an
arguable
case
from
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
did
they
do
that?
no.
they
refuted
that
in
their
sworn
answer
and
in
their
sworn
testimony.
they
said
that's
not
really
what
we
mean.
that's
not
what
we're
after.
we're
not
interested
in
representing,
we're
not
interested
in
discussing
wages,
hours
or
working
conditions
or
anything
like
that.
and
so,
they
swore
in
their
answer
and
in
their
testimony
that
they
did
not
seek
any
of
these
things
and
we
say
when
they
get
back,
that
they
cut
themselves
off
from
this
business
of
preemption.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
not
fair
or
legally
sound
for
them
to
say,
we
seek
nothing
from
this
employer
and
we
have
no
desire
to
hurt
him.
therefore,
he
can't
sue
us
in
the
state
court.
and
yet,
because
we
may
really
be
some
--
seeking
something
from
him
and
we
may
really
be
seeking
to
damage
him
after
all,
this
is
a
matter
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
are
in
effect
seeking
to
get
themselves
into
a
vacuum.
but
the
trouble
is
in
their
testimony,
they
blow
hot
and
cold
and
the
law
doesn't
like
a
vacuum.
and
when
you
blow
away,
you
do
away
with
the
vacuum
anyway.
there
is
no
vacuum
left
because
there's
atmosphere
there
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
atmosphere
in
this
case.
we
think
that
this
case
should
be
distinguished
and
affirmed.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
the
argument
today
when
i
was
asked
the
question
about
damage
that
that
proposition
might
still
be
in
it,
and
i
remembered
that
we
did
asked
for
damage
and
that
possibly
that
would
keep
from
being
moot.
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
when
i
wrote
the
brief.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
i
would
say
your
honor
in
the
light
of
what's
been
brought
to
my
attention
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
it
is
moot
because
there
is
law,
no
longer
any
question
of
damaging.
the
final
decree
of
the
lower
court,
the
final
decree
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
give
any
reference
for
damages
and
since
they
do
not,
i
think,
i'm
cut
off
from
that
and
i
think
the
case
is
with
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
oh,
on
--
on
the
question
of
bond,
the
question
was
raised
about
that.
and
on
the
matter
of
a
bond,
if
a
bond
is
wrongly
issued,
the
court
can
give
a
reference
to
a
master
on
the
question
of
the
wrongfully
suing
out
of
an
injunction,
in
other
words,
if
it
is
without
cause,
if
it
was
you
know,
malicious
or
anything
like
that,
that
can
be
a
reference
to
a
master.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
it's
a
question
of
--
it's
a
question
almost
of
--
of
the
intent
at
the
time
the
thing
is
done,
the
good
faith
you
might
say
in
--
in
seeking
the
injunction.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
that
would
be
up
to
the
judge
may
it
please
the
court,
to
the
chancellor
as
i
understand
it
and
he
would
order
a
reference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
a
reference
down
home
right
now
in
connection
with
the
patent
case
where
an
injunction
was
sued
out
and
the
injunction
was
later
dissolved
and
there's
--
yes.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
--
please,
there
is
an
injunction
bond
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
the
exact
terms
of
that
bond,
i
do
not
recall.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
sure.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
that
it
could
be.
now,
as
to
the
legality
of
it
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
it,
i
don't
know,
but
i
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
your
honor
pleases,
as
i
said
sometime
ago,
the
question
of
whether
it
is
moot
or
not
doesn't
really
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
it.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
yes.
i
think
that
--
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
of
course,
if
they
abuse
the
discretion,
that's
another
matter.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
correct
now,
i
think
that
my
fellow
--
my
counsel
here
on
the
other
side,
there's
our
court
of
appeals
great
injustice
and
insinuating
that
they
held
this
case
and
sat
on
this
case
deliberately
until
his
job
was
over.
i
--
i
don't
go
along
with
that
at
all.
i
think
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
merit
and
a
court's
taking
the
position
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
wherein
--
in
effect,
no
damage
is
being
done
to
these
people
except
their
denial
of
the
right
of
free
speech
and
they're
not
even
suing
for
their
right
of
free
of
speech.
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
--
any
--
any
damage
actually.
they
don't
predicate
this
on
free
speech.
and
i
--
i
feel
that
the
case
is
over
and
the
--
but
--
but
however
your
honor's
feel
about
--
i
mean
after
all
that
--
that's
up
to
you
as
to
whether
there's
moot
there's
not.
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
only
your
honor,
if
we
were
guilty
of
bad
faith
as
i
--
mr.
john
a.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
sir,
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
wrongfully
issued
and
--
and
the
matter
of
good
faith
enters
into
that.
you
see
on
the
basis
of
their
picketing,
we
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
picketing
to
secure
to
breach
of
a
contract
because
that's
where
their
picket
sign
said.
now,
they
come
into
court
they
say
that's
not
what
we're
after.
thank
you.
