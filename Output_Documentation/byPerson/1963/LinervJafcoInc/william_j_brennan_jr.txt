justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fuston,
may
i
get
back
a
moment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
first
ground,
i
gather
and
which
were
relying
on
--
in
watson
is
that
language
would
be
used
in
such
pressure
and
this
project
was
merely
a
sample
of
what
might
be
repeated
elsewhere
if
not
prohibited,
the
underlying
dispute
between
petitioners
and
watson's
has
not
been
shown
of
any
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is,
did
you
make
on
--
any
kind
of
record
that
--
would
indicate
this
with
only
a
sample?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
injunction
originally
ex
parte?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
affidavit's
ex
parte?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
they
had
some
foreknowledge
that
this
might
be
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
on
--
that's
in
the
record
is
it
mr.
fuston?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
happened
to
the
damages
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
still
open
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
very
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
do
i
understand
that
if
you
prevail
here,
you
may
now
go
back
and
tryout
request
for
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
have
you
move
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
about
this
bond.
if
this
case
should
be
reversed,
is
there
a
bond
outstanding
on
which
the
petitioner
her
might
seek
recovery
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
your
client
had
to
post
it
for
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
in
consequence
to
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
this
is
on
a
hypothetical
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
suggesting
of
course,
one
way
the
other
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
result
will
be.
well,
let's
say,
should
be
a
reversal
here.
i
think
that
might
be
the
predicate
for
an
action
against
your
client
on
the
bond?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
then
is
if
that's
the
fact,
how
could
this
case
possibly
be
moot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
fuston,
may
i
--
i've
look
that
it
was
since
i
asked
you
the
question.
i
don't
find
anything
but
that
one
affidavit
which
precedes
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
noticed
it's
quoted
it.
i
gathered
from
your
brief
on
page
97
something
in
which
you
suggested
in
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
intention
or
desire
to
picket
one
of
the
complainants
rea
is
coming
for
on
a
project
which
will
require
approximately
six
or
eight
months
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
they
weren't
in
the
business
of
rendering
advisory
opinions
and
therefore,
what
was
going
to
happen
in
the
future
was
is
no
concern
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
have
reference?
