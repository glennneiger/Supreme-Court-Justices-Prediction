justice
william
o.
douglas
which
delivers
concerned
with
there,
it
was
a
series
of
state
laws
because
they
hadn't
then
argued
at
the
brief
here,
they
were
various
types.
and
whether
the
state
had
reserved
in
the
--
in
the
cession
any
power
to
regulate,
there's
a
question
that
we
didn't
know.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
we
weren't
aware
of,
how
that
should
be
answered.
so
we
sent
it
back
for
trial,
didn't
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
sent
--
we
--
and
we
didn't
resolve
any
issues,
we
just
sent
that
issue
back
to
trial,
didn't
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
wasn't
aware
of
here
that
louisiana
had
made
any
reservation
of
their
power?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
is
something
in
which
we
weren't
sure,
is
that
right?
because
of
the
various
acts,
there
were
various
types
of
acts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
one
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
am
i
right
of
--
i'd
have
to
refresh
my
recollection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
my
memory
was
that
we
were
talking
there
on
the
assumption
that
--
at
that
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
there
has
been
reserved
a
right
to
regulate
and
then
we
come
down
to
what
kind
of
regulation
and
therefore,
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
if
the
--
that
kind
of
regulation
in
question
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
cession
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
they
preserved
regulation
that
would
be
--
a
continuation
of
that
kind
of
regulation
would
be
presumed
--
i
as
i
remember
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
if
you're
right,
i
don't
--
suppose
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
maybe
you're
right,
i
