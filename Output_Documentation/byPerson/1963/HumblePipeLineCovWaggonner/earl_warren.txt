the
section
of
appropriation
act
that
is
quoted
in
--
on
page

of
the
government's
brief,
lend
any
force
to
that.
i
noticed
that
it
--
it
says
here
that
"secretary
of
war
is
hereby
authorized
when
directed
by
the
president
to
accept
in
behalf
of
united
states
free
from
encumbrances
and
without
cost
to
the
united
states,
the
title
in
fee
simple
to
such
land
is
he
maybe
necessary
or
desirable
of
the
city
of
shreveport
approximately
25,000
acres,
more
or
less
as
a

for

aviation
fee."

so
with
that,
i
suppose
that
would
limit
the
government
to
accepting
title
in
fee
simple.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
