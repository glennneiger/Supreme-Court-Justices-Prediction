how

what
it
did

humble?
justice

did
it
acquire
a
title
to
it?
justice

and
of
an

justice

black
you
mean
the
government
here
(voice

--
justice
hugo

but
it
has
not
conveyed
the
land
away?
justice

who
has
the
control
of
the
surface
of
the
land
now?
justice

if
they

if
they
had
obtained

by

could
the

waive
it?
justice

saying
that

that
the

had
accept

accepted
exclusive

as
a

can

its

can
it

exclusive

(inaudible)
nothing
more
than
--
that
when
the
government
at
your
land,
sold
it
but
retained
title
of
security
for
his
debt,
the
state
could
tax
the
purchasers
right
in
that
property,
that's
all
it
held,
wasn't
it?
that
was
the
question
of
the
state
that
was
presented
in
the
beginning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
only
question
in
the
--
according
to
the
question
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
it
was
within
the
territory
of
the
state.
it
was
then
the
boundaries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
say
that
has
been
--
am
--
am
i
correct
in
say
--
pointing
that
you
said
that
unless
the
state
reserves
a
right
to
tax
and
a
lead
to
the
government
of
--
by
a
government
acquired
property
for
the
exclusive
right
--
exclusive
rights
unless
the
state
reserves
that
it
has
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that,
unless
the
state
has
reserved
the
right
to
tax
of
the
condition,
as
i
understood
you
are
reading
from
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
the
original
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
if
the
state
has
a
right
to
tax
even
though
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
some
showing
if
the
state
re
--
reserved
it
with
a
knowledge
of
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
you
said
it
wasn't
a
purchase
cost
of
donations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
assuming
that
it
was
a
purchase,
do
you
claim
that
the
state
can
tax
if
it
didn't
reserve
that
right
either
expressly
or
impliedly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
putting
it
--
you're
putting
it
then
on
something
that
happened
afterwards.
you're
putting
after
--
you
--
you
take
the
position
that
the
lease
is
likely
a
conditional
sale
and
that
--
and
the
case
to
which
justice
--
mr.
justice
reed
wrote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument
there
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
government
took
exclusive
right
to
control
except
for
those
two
reservations
that
you
mentioned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
this
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
assent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one.
what's
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
pipeline
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ad
valorem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
instead
of
taking
the
lease,
the
convener
had
bought
this
unconditional
sale
be
paid
yearly
over
a
certain
number
of
years.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
as
we
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
think
the
government
had
given
a
lease
that
louisiana
could
tax?
our
government
given
a
title,
conditional
title
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
it
had
departed
with
title
said
that
in
the
period
--
after
it
spent
50
years,
the
title
shall
revert
to
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
had
conveyed
the
land
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
conveys
the
land
to
the
company
saying
that
conveying,
with
all
the
rights
of
pertinency
thereto
and
so
forth,
but
said
that
it's
conveyed
for
the
understanding
that
within
50
years,
title
will
revert
to
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
not
the
government
giving
a
deed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
leased
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
deed,
in
all
respect,
is
like
a
deed
except
that
the
deed
provided
at
the
end
of
50
years,
the
title
should
revert
to
the
government.
would
--
could
louisiana
then
have
taxed
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's'
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
points
to
some
of
the
difficulties
of
the
numerous
cases
we've
had.
do
you
pay
a
similar
tax
to
louisiana
on
your
wells?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
(inaudible)
the
invalidation
of
louisiana's
rights
to
severance
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
--
your
--
if
your
argument
were
accepted
on
this
tax
--
ad
valorem
tax,
would
it
require
an
acceptance
going
further
and
saying
that
louisiana
could
not
tax

justice

i'm
talking
about
severance
tax
