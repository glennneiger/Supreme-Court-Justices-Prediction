justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
louisiana
can
repossess
these
lands?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
realize
that
but
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
cession
had
been
a
conditional
cession
in
effect.
and
therefore,
you
could
tax
since
the
condition
had
been
reached.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
clause
saying
that
louisiana
can
tax
with
those
conditions
that
were
not
implied
with
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
state
again,
i
don't
get
what
your
position
of
purchase
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

mean

monetary
consideration.
