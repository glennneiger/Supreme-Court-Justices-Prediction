mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
has
asked
that
i
convey
to
the
court
his
personal
regards
as
regrets
that
he
could
not
be
here
on
this
occasion.
if
it
please
the
court,
it
suffices
to
say
that
we
do
not
share
mr.
yancey's
claim
that
this
is
a
simple
case
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
barksdale
air
force
base.
i'm
sure
the
--
the
court
will
recognize
that
this
is
--
that
these
cases
are
only
a
few
of
many
in
the
long
struggle
through
the
years
of
states
to
have
recognized
their
rights
to
tax
property
of
private
persons
located
within
a
federal
enclave.
we
represent
the
respondent
in
this
case,
we
state
by
way
of
explanation
because
he
is
a
constitutional
officer
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
it
is
in
the
performance
of
his
constitutional
duties
that
these
cases
arose.
the
constitution
of
louisiana
provides
that
the
sheriff
is
tax
collector.
he
collects
the
taxes
of
the
state,
parish
and
all
other
taxes
imposed
in
his
parish,
other
than
municipal
taxes.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
that
the
oil
and
gas
lease
involved
in
this
case,
insofar
as
the
two
petitioners
represented
by
mr.
yancey
and
the
lands
thereby
affected
are
the
same
as
those
that
were
at
issue
in
murphy
corporation
against
fontenot,
which
was
a
1954
case
decided
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
october
of
1954.
now,
in
that
case,
there
was
imposed
by
the
state
of
louisiana
a
severance
tax
on
the
severer
of
oil
and
gas
from
the
soil
located
within
barksdale
air
force
base.
now,
it
is
also
the
same
oil
and
gas
lease
as
--
and
the
lands
thereby
affected
were
the
same
as
were
involved
in
the
case
of
mississippi
river
--
river
fuel
corporation
against
fontenot
which
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
which
this
same
court
denied
certiorari
in
november
of
1956
and
thereto
was
involved
a
severance
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
on
the
--
the
severance
from
the
soil
of
minerals
if
it
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
in
each
of
those
two
cases.
they
were
like
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
at
this
particular
place,
the
same
lease,
the
same
lands.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
the
--
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
if
it
pleases.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
well,
i'll
answer
that
now
though.
it
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
federal
government
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
of
the
federal
constitution
was
raised
in
the
case
of
mississippi
river
fuel
corporation
against
fontenot.
and
the
united
states
district
court
judge,
judge
christenberry,
in
new
orleans,
held
that
the
federal
government
did
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
because
these
lands
were
not
purchased.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
did
not
mention
that
question
in
its
decision.
it
pinched
its
decision
simply
upon
the
point
of
the
taxability
power
of
the
state.
it
did
not
get
into
the
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
so
it's
sequestered
that
--
that
issue.
now,
these
lands,
22,000
acres
of
land
required
not
by
deeds
but
by
acts
of
donation
from
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
city
of
shreveport
and
the
bossier
parish
levee
board
which
is
an
agency
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
a
political
corporation.
they
were
all
recognized
and
authority
given
for
them
by
resolutions
adopted
by
the
state
legislature
insofar
as
the
act
of
donation
by
the
state,
a
resolution
by
the
bossier
levee
board
and
a
resolution
by
the
city
of
shreveport
city
council.
now,
in
these
resolutions
which
are
made
part
of
the
record
and
which
are
--
were
taxed
to
and
maybe
part
of
the
acts
of
donation,
it
is
therein
provided
that
these
lands
were
to
be
used
for
military
purposes,
for
the
construction
of
an
air
base.
now,
we
--
as
mr.
o'quin
said
in
our
brief
on
page
10,
"we
do
--
we
do
concede
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
granted
to
the
federal
government
by
the
acts
mentioned
but
only
in
accordance
with
these
provisions."
now,
he
--
he
just
--
he
slighted
over
those
words.
now,
it's
our
position
that
--
that
these
acts
of
donation
were
made
for
a
specific
purpose,
that
these
lands
be
used
for
military
purposes.
and
therefore,
when
the
--
when
the
acts
of
the
legislature
granted
the
--
the
cession
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
these
--
this
purpose
was
incorporated
in
the
act
of
cession.
then,
it
--
it
forwards
itself
down
to
this
that
--
that
the
federal
government
had
--
was
given
exclusive
jurisdiction
only
so
long
as
these
lands
were
used
for
military
purposes
as
provided
in
the
resolutions
which
were
attached
to
and
made
a
part
of
the
acts
of
donation
in
each
case.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
the
--
the
resolutions
which
are
attached
to
and
made
a
part
of
each
act
of
donation.
in
--
in
one
instance
there
--
the
resolution
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
--
which
authorized
the
donation
to
the
federal
government
of
the
lands
owned
by
the
state,
the
resolution
adopted
by
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
shreveport
insofar
as
the
lands
conveyed
by
the
act
donation
to
the
federal
government
by
the
city
and
the
resolution
of
the
bossier
parish
levee
board
authorizing
it
to
convey
these
lands
to
the
federal
government
by
act
of
donation.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
act
12?
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
not
the
act
of
cessions.
no,
your
honor,
but
we
say
that
they
were
incorporated
into
the
acts
of
cession
that
--
that
these
resolutions
--
these
acts
of
donation
or
impliedly,
at
least,
incorporated
into
these
acts
of
cession.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
--
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
state
of
louisiana
could
repossess
these
lands.
these
--
these
acts
of
donation
were
binding,
enforceable,
executed
and
--
or
we
--
we
merely
--
we
are
merely
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
the
residual
power
of
the
state
to
tax
private
property
located
within
this
reservation.
that
is
the
sole
question
involved.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well,
that
is
our
position
insofar
as
power
to
tax
is
concerned
but
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
--
that
the
state
of
louisiana
could
--
could
reclaim
these
lands.
the
--
there's
--
there's
no
clause
in
the
--
in
the
act
of
donation
providing
for
retrocession
to
the
--
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
no,
sir.
there
is
no
provision
for
that.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
know,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
how
the
humble
pipeline
company
acquired
this
right
of
way.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
so.
unquestionably,
in
--
in
our
state,
the
--
the
rights
of
--
of
a
pipeline
company
to
lake
pipe
under
certain
lands
is
acquired
by
right
of
way.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
an
easement?
we
call
it
a
servitude,
a
right
of
servitude
in
--
in
our
state.
and
under
article
490
of
our
civil
code,
which
i
cite
in
--
in
our
brief,
it's
provided
that
where
there
is
a
servitude
affecting
lands,
that
the
--
the
owner
has
only
a
naked
title,
a
naked
title.
so
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
the
government
here
has
--
has
only
a
naked
title
insofar
as
the
lands
under
which
these
pipe
lines
are
laid.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
no,
sir.
the
federal
government
has
not
conveyed
the
land
away.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
the
federal
government.
now,
as
--
as
referred
to
by
mr.
yancey,
i'll
just
bring
this
out
by
way
of
emphasis
again.
the
cantonment
area
of
this
base
comprises
a
--
1000
to
1500
acres
of
land
and
there
is
a
semi-improved
part
of
the
base
which
includes
the
air
field
proper,
which
comprises
about
1500
acres
and
that
leaves
about
19,000
acres
of
land
of
this
original
acquisition
which
is
a
part
of
what's
known
as
the
"east
reservation."
counsel
referred
to
it
as
east
base,
actually
it's
--
it's
called
the
--
the
east
reservation.
now,
this
is
an
unimproved
part
of
the
base.
it's
--
it's
grown
over
with
--
with
trees,
brush,
except
for
certain
portions,
i'm
sure
that
--
that
have
been
cleared.
for
instance,
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
drilling
on
--
on
these
lands.
but,
this
is
a
--
a
non-improved
part
of
the
base
and
the
--
the
base
itself
occupies
a
very
small
part
of
this
22,000
acres,
only
about
3000
acres,
leaving
about
19,000
unimproved.
now,
it's
a
part
of
these
19,000
acres
that
was
leased
for
oil
and
gas
purposes,
2060
acres
were
leased,
2060
acres
of
these
19,000
acres
of
the
unimproved
part
of
the
base
was
leased.
i
don't
know
that
--
i
don't
know
that
we
have
ever
said
that
or
that
the
court
has
ever
said
that
--
that
the
federal
government
has
abandoned
this
--
this
acreage
that
was
--
was
leased
for
oil
and
gas
purposes.
what
the
court
said
was
--
what
the
court
said
was
that
these
--
these
lands
that
were
leased
were
separated
from
the
remainder
of
the
base
and
so
they
were
because
the
lease
itself
provides
that
they
were
to
be
enclosed
within
fence.
now,
the
court
in
the
murphy
corporation
case,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
case
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
held
that
--
that
this
--
this
acreage
was
actually
separated
for
--
from
the
from
the
remainder
of
the
base,
that
it
was
under
fence,
that
there
was
an
autonomous
operation
of
this
--
this
oil
and
gas
field
by
these
private
individuals.
that
the
--
that
the
government
in
the
lease,
recognized
their
right
of
ownership
to
that
and
--
and
meet
and
send
use
of
their
tanks,
their
--
their
wheel
equipment,
their
pipes
and
other
paraphernalia.
now,
if
it
please
the
court.
our
argument
in
this
case
has
pursued
two
approaches.
counsel
refers
only
to
one
approach
and
that
is
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
but
we
--
we
have
approached
this
problem
two
ways,
both
from
the
standpoint
of
territorial
jurisdiction
of
a
state
and
also
from
the
standpoint
of
the
taxability
power
of
the
state
without
regard
to
territorial
jurisdiction
in
the
state.
now,
our
--
our
argument
--
our
points
of
argument
of
these,
first
of
all,
we
say
that
there
is
no
exclusive
jurisdiction
acquired
solely
by
virtue
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
of
the
federal
constitution
because
this
was
not
a
purchase
or
condemnation
as
the
word
"purchase"
has
been
implemented
by
court
decisions.
it
--
the
--
this
--
this
court
in
a
--
in
a
late
case,
paul
versus
united
states
referred
to
a
--
referred
to
a
purchase
or
condemnation.
now,
we
say,
this
was
not
acquired
in
either
of
those
two
ways
and
when
we
say
purchase,
we
--
we
do
not
mean
the
common
law
use
of
the
word
"purchase,"
which
means
a
--
an
acquisition
in
anyway,
other
than
by
descent
or
inheritance
but
we
mean
an
--
an
acquisition
by
--
by
purchase,
by
transfer
from
one
to
another.
then
we
--
we
--
our
further
point
is
this,
that
the
cession
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
state
to
the
federal
government
was
solely
for
military
purposes
and
i've
already
--
i've
already
covered
that.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes
sir,
referring
--
referring
to
our
--
our
brief
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
in
our
--
our
point
number
one
of
our
argument,
the
word
"purchase,"
as
used
in
the
clause
of
the
constitution,
does
not
have
the
technical
meaning
of
the
term
at
common
law
of
an
acquisition
of
lands,
other
than
by
descent
or
inheritance
but
has
the
meaning
on
an
acquisition
thereof
by
an
actual
purchase.
and
we
cite
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
for
a
monetary
consideration,
yes
sir.
we
--
we
cite
the
case
of
state
ex
rel.
board
of
county
commissioners
of
valley
county
against
bruce,
county
assessor,
which
is
a
case
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
in
1937
and
it
was
--
affirmed
by
--
by
this
court,
but
a
divided
court
and
cited
in
305
u.s.
577,
83
law
edition
363
of
1959
supreme
court
465.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
monetary
consideration.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
not
have
that
available
now
but
--
but
there
was
--
there
was
a
--
an
opinion
by
the
united
states
attorney
general
holding
that
--
to
that
effect,
that
there
has
to
be
a
monetary
consideration.
they
even
held,
i
think,
in
one
opinion
that
--
that
--
the
--
the
consideration
recited
of
$1
was
not
sufficient
to
constitute
that
a
--
a
purchase.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i
--
i
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes
--
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
think
so
that
that
would
be
our
position,
yes,
sir.
now,
to
proceed,
our
--
our
next
point
is
this,
our
point
of
--
of
argument
is
this
that
the
--
if
--
if
exclusive
jurisdiction
did
this
by
virtue
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
of
the
federal
constitution
and
if
the
act
of
cession
was
sufficient
to
--
to
vest
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
government,
then
we
say
that
the
--
that
that
is
not
the
controlling
factor,
that
the
cession
by
the
state
is
not
the
controlling
factor.
that
the
federal
government
here
has
evidence
to
its
intention
not
to
--
to
accept
the
grant
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
we
say
that
by
virtue
of
the
holding
in
the
ibm
against
(inaudible)
which
was
decided
by
our
louisiana
supreme
court
in
which
the
court
held
just
that
that
the
decision
by
the
state
was
not
in
itself
controlling.
that
you
had
the
look
to
the
circumstances
of
--
of
each
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
the
intent
of
the
federal
government
to
accept
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
following
the
--
the
dravo
case,
james
versus
dravo
case,
decided
by
this
--
this
court
and
the
silas
mason
company
case
also
decided
by
this
court,
both
at
the
same
cession.
they
--
they
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
in
the
ibm
case
that
the
federal
government
was
receiving
and
accepting
police
protection,
the
--
different
utilities
such
as
water,
sewerage,
gas,
telephone
services
from
--
from
the
state
and
from
the
city
of
new
orleans
in
that
case
and
also
school
--
school
facilities.
i
believe
school
facilities
were
involved
there.
that
those
factors
evidenced
and
intent
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
not
to
accept
exclusive
jurisdiction
then
our
--
our
further
point
was
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i
don't
believe
i
understand
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
--
that
obviously,
the
federal
government
must
act
through
its
agents
and
--
and
whether
they
accepted
exclusive
jurisdiction,
assuming
that
it
did,
they
necessarily
acted
through
its
--
its
agents,
whoever
they
might
have
been
in
that
--
in
that
case.
presumably,
the
secretary
of
war.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
under
authority
of
congress,
yes
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
we
--
we
will
bring
that
out
later
in
our
argument
but
we
--
we
hold
--
we
--
we
say
not.
we
--
we
say
that
the
s.r.a.
against
state
of
minnesota
case
decided
by
this
court
has
authority
to
the
fact
that
that
does
not
have
to
be
in
the
act
of
retrocession
by
congress.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
now,
our
further
point
is
that
--
that
the
uses
of
the
land
leased
and
that
traversed
by
the
pipelines
do
not
meet
the
prescribed
purposes
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17,
that
they
were
not
to
be
used
for
the
erection
of
"forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
dock-yards,
and
other
needful
buildings."
this
was
also
held
in
the
murphy
corporation
case.
the
--
the
court
held
there,
our
supreme
court
--
our
louisiana
supreme
court
held
that
these
leased
lands
were
not
to
be
used
for
those
purposes
as
--
as
defined
in
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i'm
sure
it
has
not
been,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
because
they
--
they
would
necessarily
have
to
leave
that
land
open
for
purposes
of
repair
of
these
lines
and
for
accessibility.
i
--
i
don
t
--
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
government
is
actually
occupying
any
of
the
surface
portion
of
this
land
traversed
by
the
pipelines.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
could
--
could
i
describe
--
well,
i
cannot
describe.
there
is
a
--
a
plaque
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
record
which
--
which
shows
the
--
the
location
of
those
lines.
one
is
an
eight-inch
line,
an
eight-inch
in
diameter
line
and
the
other
is
a
10-inch
diameter
line.
but
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
generally,
in
these
cases
where
--
where
there
is
a
servitude
for
--
where
there
is
a
servitude
for
laying
and
running
up
pipelines,
the
--
the
owner
who
has
only
a
naked
title
cannot
or
--
or
should
not
use
the
surface
of
that
land
because
it
would
be
--
it
--
it
would
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
--
of
the
owner
of
the
servitude.
it
would
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
owner
of
the
servitude.
now,
we
further
say
in
this
case
as
did
the
murphy
corporation
case,
that
the
lease
between
the
federal
government
and
the
petitioners
represented
by
mr.
yancey
in
this
case
is
the
law
of
this
case
and
the
--
in
that
--
in
that
particular
instance,
the
lease
provides
that
the
lessee
must
pay
when
due,
all
taxes
lawfully
assessed
and
levied
on
the
laws
of
the
state
or
the
united
states,
upon
improvements,
oil
and
gas
produced
from
the
lands
hereunder
or
other
rights,
property
or
assets
of
the
lessee.
and
the
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
interpreting
that
clause
of
the
lease,
held
that
that
--
that
clause
was
the
--
was
the
law
of
the
case
insofar
as
these
particular
lessees
were
concerned.
as
to
--
as
to
humble
pipeline
company,
it
only
owns
a
--
a
right
of
way
which
is
a
servitude
under
louisiana
and
the
federal
government,
never
could
have
exercised
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
lands
traversed
by
these
pipelines,
because
either
the
government
took
those
lands
subject
to
those
pipelines
at
the
time
of
acquisition
or
else,
the
government
itself
granted
this
--
this
right
of
way
for
these
pipelines.
and
in
either
instance,
the
federal
government
could
not
exercise
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
lands.
we
further
say
that
these
petitioners
cannot
cloth
themselves
with
the
medal
of
governmental
immunity.
all
these
petitioners,
represented
by
mr.
yancey,
come
into
this
court
and
say
that
they
are
not
relying
upon
any
relationship
that
they
have
with
the
--
with
the
federal
government
as
lessees
under
an
oil
and
gas
lease.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
--
we
say
that
--
that
it's
--
as
i
said
before,
we
approach
this
in
two
ways.
first,
we
use
the
approach
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
the
state
has
territorial
jurisdiction
to
levy
a
tax
against
private
individuals
on
property
of
those
individuals
situated
within
the
reservation.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
no
sir,
this
is
not
an
alternative
argument.
we
--
this
is
--
this
is
our
argument
throughout
this
case.
we
have
not
spelled
it
out
as
such
but
--
but
the
affect
of
it
is
--
is
that
we
have
assumed
this
--
this
double-pronged
approach
that
there
was
territorial
jurisdiction
or
there
was
taxability
power
vested
in
the
state
without
reference
to
territorial
jurisdiction.
if
i
may,
the
--
diverge
from
--
from
my
argument
just
a
moment,
i
--
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
s.r.a.
versus
state
of
minnesota
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1946.
and
mr.
justice
--
former
justice
--
mr.
justice
reed
was
the
organ
of
the
--
of
the
court
and
he's
--
he
said
there
--
if
i
can
find
the
--
the
proper
--
proper
place
here.
he
said
--
he
said
there
--
he
says,
"the
impact
of
state
taxation
on
federal
operations
may
be
so
closed
and
threatening
as
to
compel
judicial
intervention
to
declare
the
state
tax
invalid
as
in
mcculloch
case,"
or
course,
he
was
referring
to
mcculloch
against
maryland,
very
old
case,
decided
by
this
court,
"or
so
remote
or
incidental
as
to
justify
a
federal
court
in
refusing
to
relieve
a
taxpayer
from
a
state
tax."
and
it
--
as
he
--
the
court
cited
alabama
against
king
&
boozer,
also
decided
by
this
court.
and
then
he
said
this,
he
says,
"the
line
of
taxability
is
somewhat
irregular
and
has
varied
through
the
years."
now,
in
this
particular
case,
what
had
happened
was
this,
that
the
federal
government
made
a
transfer
of
property
over
which
it
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
of
the
federal
constitution.
it
made
a
transfer
of
this
property
by
an
executory
contract
to
a
private
individual.
then
the
state
sought
to
tax
the
interest
of
this
individual
and
the
individual
then
brought
this
suit,
seeking
to
be
relieved
from
state
tax.
the
title
to
the
property
remained
in
the
federal
government
but
the
--
the
transferee
had
the
right
of
possession
and
had
made
certain
improvements
upon
the
property.
the
title
which
had
remained
in
the
federal
government
was
for
purposes
of
security
until
the
--
the
final
installment
payment
had
been
made
on
the
contract.
it
was
having
been
made
--
the
sale,
having
been
made
under
a
credit
contract,
a
credit
sale,
an
installment
contract.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
stone
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concurred
in
--
in
that
decision
but
they
thought
that
the
decision
should
have
limit
--
been
limited
to
the
question
of
taxability
by
the
state
and
should
have
not
been
premised
upon
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
the
majority
opinion
as
i
said
rendered
by
mr.
stone
and
mr.
justice
reed,
premised
the
decision
upon
the
--
the
fact
that
the
state
had
territorial
jurisdiction
over
this
property.
and
as
i
said,
the
--
the
concurring
opinion
expressed
itself
that
--
that
they
thought
that
the
decision
should
have
been
premised
rather
not
upon
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state
but
upon
the
taxability
power
of
the
state
irregardless
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
so,
we
think,
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well,
mr.
justice
black,
that
--
that
was
discussed
in
the
case
and
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
that
was
--
that
was
presented
and
that
was
discussed
but
--
but
the
decision
did
not
--
was
not
premised
simply
upon
that
because
as
i
said,
the
--
the
court
held
that
there
was
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
they
--
they
held
it
was
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
state.
it
was
within
a
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state
irregardless
of
a
fact
that
title
was
yet
vested
in
the
federal
government.
now,
we
make
the
still
further
point
that
--
that
state
tax
laws
existing
at
the
time
of
acquisition
of
this
property
yet
remain
enforceable
as
against
private
individuals
owning
properties
situated
within
the
confines
of
barksdale
air
force
base.
in
our
brief,
we
--
we
show
that
the
constitutional
provision
of
our
state
which
gives
to
the
legislature
the
power
to
tax,
has
been
in
our
constitution
since
its
adoption
in
1921.
now,
this
argument
is
--
is
made
by
virtue
of
a
recent
case
decided
by
this
court,
paul
against
united
states,
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
rendered
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court.
it's
a
1962
decision
and
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
quoting
from
this
case,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
quote
at
length
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
"the
main
question
in
this
case
is
whether
california
can
enforce
for
a
minimum
wholesale,
price
regulations
as
respects
milk
sold
to
the
united
states
at
three
military
installations,
travis
air
force
base,
castle
air
force
base
and
oakland
army
terminal,
located
within
california
and
used
for
strictly,
military
consumption
or
resale
at
federal
commissaries
and
for
consumption
or
resale
at
various
military
clubs
and
post
exchanges.
milk
used
for
the
first
two
categories
of
use
is
paid
full
with
appropriated
funds
while
that
used
in
the
clubs
and
exchanges
is
purchased
with
non-appropriated
funds."
after
holding
that
--
that
with
reference
to
the
--
the
milk
used
for
the
first
two
categories,
came
with
--
within
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
that
therefore,
the
--
the
regulations
of
the
state
of
california
were
not
binding
or
effective
as
to
the
milk
used
in
those
two
--
first
categories.
then
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
they
will
pay
full
with
--
with
appropriated
funds.
yes,
sir.
so
then
the
court
said,
"this
brings
us
to
the
question
whether
congress
has
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
over
these
enclaves
within
the
meaning
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
of
the
constitution.
the
power
of
cong
--
congress
over
federal
enclaves
that
come
within
the
scope
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17,
is
obviously
the
same
as
the
power
of
congress
over
the
district
of
columbia.
the
cases
made
clear
that
the
grant
of
exclusive
legislative
power
to
congress
over
enclaves
that
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
by
its
own
weight
bars
state
regulation
without
specific
congressional
action."
thus,
the
first
question
here
is
whether
the
three
enclaves
in
question,
were
purchased
by
the
consent
of
the
legislature
of
california
within
the
meaning
of
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17.
thus,
that
the
united
states
acquires
with
the
consent
of
the
legislature,
land
within
the
borders
of
that
state
by
purchase
or
condemnation
for
any
of
the
purposes
mentioned
in
article
i,
section
8,
cl.
17
or
if
the
land
is
acquired
without
such
consent
and
later,
the
state
gives
its
consent,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
becomes
exclusive.
in
either
event,
whether
the
lands
acquired
by
purchase
or
condemnation,
on
the
one
hand
or
by
cession
on
the
other,
a
state
may
condition
its
consent
upon
the
intention
--
upon
the
--
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
over
the
lands
consistent
with
the
federal
use,
citing
james
against
dravo
contracting
company,
supra,
302
u.s.

moreover,
as
stated

the
constitution
does
not
commend,
and
this
is
the
important
part.
the
constitution
does
not
commend
that
every
vestige
of
the
laws
of
the
power
--
of
the
former
sovereignty
must
vanish.
on
the
contrary,
its
language
has
long
been
interpreted
so
as
to
permit
the
continued
--
the
continuance
until
abrogated
by
--
of
those
rules
existing
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
of
sovereignty
which
govern
the
rights
of
the
occupants
of
the
territory
transferred.
this
assumes
that
no
area,
however,
small
will
be
left
without
a
developed
legal
system
for
private
rights.
the
conditions
expressed
in
the
california
acts
by
which
california
considered
to
the
purchase
or
condemnation
of
land
by
the
united
states
for
the
prescribed
purposes,
do
not
undertake
to
make
applicable
to
the
federal
enclaves
or
future
laws
of
california.
now,
i
--
i'd
like
to
stop
at
that
moment.
the
case
indicates
that
the
california
statutes
in
this
case
which
ceded
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
only
retained,
reserved
to
the
state
civil
and
criminal
process
and
the
power
to
--
of
taxation.
now,
here
we're
not
dealing
with
the
power
of
taxation,
we're
dealing
with
the
power
of
a
state
to
regulate
the
wholesale
price
of
milk
within
these
three
military
bases
owned
by
the
federal
government.
since
a
--
now,
to
go
on,
since
a
state
may
not
legislate
with
respect
to
a
federal
enclave
unless
--
unless
it
reserved
the
right
to
do
so
when
it
gave
its
consent
to
the
purchase
by
the
united
states,
only
state
law
existing
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
remains
enforceable,
not
subsequent
laws.
see,
james
stewart
&
company
against
sadrakula
and
the
citation
is
there,
and
also
arlington
hotel
versus
fant.
now,
my
opponents
have
taken
some
comfort
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
case
of
arlington
hotel
versus
fant,
they
say
that
it
means
something
entirely
different
from
what
this
court
has
interpreted,
that
case
has
meaning.
arlington
hotel
versus
fant
has
merely
held
as
--
as
said
in
sadrakula
says,
conversely
in
arlington
hotel
company
versus
fant
with
the
citation
and
arkansas
statute
for
leaving
innkeepers,
passed
after
the
cession
of
hot
springs
reservation
was
held
unavailing
as
a
defense
to
a
reservation
innkeepers
common
law
liability
in
accordance
with
arkansas
law
before
the
cession.
in
other
words,
arkansas
had
passed
this
law
after
the
cession
and
this
court
said
that
what
was
meant
in
arlington
hotel
company
against
fant
was
merely
that
if
the
laws
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
this
property,
then
they
yet
continue
to
remain
in
effect
but
that
if
the
law
was
passed
after
the
cession
by
the
state
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government,
then
they
do
not
apply.
now,
we
say
there's
no
difference
between
the
regulation
of
--
of
the
wholesale
price
of
milk
on
military
reservations
or
a
taxation
of
private
property
of
private
individuals
located
on
a
base.
we
have
shown
in
this
case
more
than
abundantly
that
this
taxation
of
private
property
is
entirely
consonant
and
compatible
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
operation
of
this
air
base.
there
has
never
been
any
interference
with
the
--
with
the
rights
or
the
intent
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
never
complained
about
this
taxation
of
private
property.
now,
the
federal
government
has,
through
the
justice
department,
filed
an
amicus
--
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
case
but
simply
upon
the
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
not
upon
the
right,
the
taxability
power
of
a
state
to
levy
a
tax
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
but
simply
they
raise
the
question
--
they
say
that
is
important
because
they
have
got
hundreds
of
bases
throughout
the
country
and
it's
important
to
know
the
demarcation
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
it
has
them
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
it
has
not?
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
i
don't
understand
that
from
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
black.
if
i
may
go
back
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
we
think
so
in
this
case.
of
course
we
go
back,
i'm
not
going
to
burden
the
court
with
further
argument
on
these
points
but
we
go
back
to
the
original
argument
that
this
was
not
a
purchase
under
article
1
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
section
8,
cl.
17
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
right,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir,
we
think
so
in
this
case.
because
as
i
have
heretofore
pointed
out
and
as
stated
in
our
brief,
the
federal
government
in
--
in
leasing
this
land,
has
expressed
an
intent.
i
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
right,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
now,
getting
back
to
the
other
argument,
i'd
like
to
refer
back
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
because
i
don't
understand
that
that
is
what
he
said.
as
i
said
heretofore,
the
--
the
acts
of
cession
involving
california
in
--
in
that
case
only
reserved
unto
the
state
civil
and
criminal
process
and
the
power
to
tax.
but
here,
the
--
in
that
case,
there
was
no
power
--
there
was
no
tax
problem
involved.
there
was
no
tax
problem
involved.
there
was
the
regulation
of
milk
prices,
regulation
of
milk
prices.
now,
that
is
not
a
tax.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
that's
right,
sir.
that's
exactly
right.
going
back
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas,
he
says,
"the
conditions
expressed
in
the
california
acts
by
which
california
consider
into
the
purchase
or
condemnation
of
land
by
the
united
states
for
the
prescribed
purposes,
do
not
undertake
to
make
applicable
to
the
federal
enclaves
all
future
laws
of
california"
or
(voice

mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well,
if
--
if
i
may
say
this,
i
--
i
don't
want
--
don't
want
to
dispute
the
--
your
honor.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
you
sent
the
case
back
to
the
trial
--
i'm
just
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
louisiana
did
not
make
any
reservation
of
their
power
in
this
case
but
neither
did
california
in
that
case.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well
mr.
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
--
justice
douglas,
i
didn't
understand
that
from
the
opinion.
but
here's
what
--
here's
what
was
said.
what
--
what
this
court
did
was
to
remand
the
case
to
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
--
to
determine
if
these
milk
regulations
were
in
existence
at
the
time
that
the
acquisition
was
made
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
or
not
these
regulations,
that
is
whether
or
not
these
particular
regulations
or
some
regulations
of
that
particular
pattern,
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
now,
we
have
the
same
--
same
situation
here,
we
say.
there's
no
reservation
here,
nor
was
there
any
reservation
in
the
calif
--
california
case.
your
honor
said
this,
"since
a
state
may
not
legislate
with
respect
to
a
federal
enclave
unless
it
reserved
the
right
to
do
so
when
it
gave
its
consent
to
the
purchase
by
the
united
states,
only
state
law
existing
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
remains
enforceable,
not
subsequent
laws."
so
that
excluded
any
reservation.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
well
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
as
i
--
as
i
say,
my
recollection
of
the
case
and
my
impression
of
it
was
merely
that
this
court
remanded
the
case
to
determine
if
there
were
regulations
in
existence
at
the
time
when
the
acquisition
was
made.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
yes,
sir.
i'd
like
to
point
this,
if
it
please
the
court.
there
is
another
case
which
gives
us
comfort,
which
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief
inadvertently,
but
it
is
cited
in
the
government's
amicus
curiae
brief.
and
if
i
--
if
i
may,
the
--
the
case
is
offutt
housing
company
against
sarpy
county,
a
1956
decision,
and
the
citation
is
351
u.s.
253.
now,
involved
in
that
case,
was
an
interpretation
of
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act.
and
that
section
provided,
"the
lessee's
interest
made
or
created,
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
made
subject
to
state
or
local
taxation."
former
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
this.
he
said,
"we
could
regard
article
1,
section
8,
cl.
17
as
of
such
overwriting
and
comprehensive
school
that
consent
by
congress
to
state
taxation
of
obviously
valuable
private
interest
located
in
an
area,
subject
to
the
power
exclusive
legislation,
is
to
be
found
only
inexplicit
and
unambiguous
legislative
enactment."
we
have
not
heretofore
so
regarded
it
because
--
now,
this
answers
--
this
answers
our
opponents'
claim
that
there
has
to
be
an
act
of
congress
retroceding
jurisdiction
to
the
state.
he
said,
"we
have
not
heretofore
so
regarded
it."

nor
all
we
constrain
by
reason
to
treat
this
exercise
by
congress
of
the
exclusive
legislation
power
and
the
manner
of
construing
it
any
differently
from
any

exercise
by

of
that
power.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
congress
has
seen
fit
not
to
express
itself
unequivocally.
we
do
not
hold
that
congress
has
relinquished
this
power
over
these
areas.
we
hold
only
that
congress,
in
the
exercise
of
this
power,
has
permitted
such
state
taxation
as
is
involved
in
the
present
case.
and
we
say
the
same
thing
here.
we
had
--
we
had
the
--
the
murphy
corporation
case
against
fontenot.
we
have
the
mississippi
river

corporation
against
fontenot.
certiorari
was
denied
in
both
of
those
cases

there
has
been
eight

since
the

and
congress
has
not
taken
any
steps
whatsoever
to
act
to
immunize
these
private
corporations
or
to
--
to
say
that
the
states
should
not
tax
them.
we
say
that
--
that
congress
has
assented
to
the
taxation
of
these
private
individuals
in
--
in
these
cases.
sir?
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
makes
no
difference.
mr.
ferdinand
a.
cashio
these
taxes
in
--
in
the
instances
of
the
--
mr.
ferdinand
a.

in
the
instances
of
the
petitioners
represented
by
mr.

they
are
the

owned

used
by
them
in
their

commercial
pursuits
and
located

mr.

the
other
is

a

mr.

the

themselves.
yes,
