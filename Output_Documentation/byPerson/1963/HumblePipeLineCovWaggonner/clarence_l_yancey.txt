mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this,
we
think
is
a
rather
simple
case
and
it
deals
only
with
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
the
military
air
base,
barksdale
air
force
base,
located
in
bossier
parish,
louisiana.
and
also,
whether
or
not
having
exclusive
jurisdiction,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
the
right
to
tax,
to
levy
ad
valorem
taxes
covering
private
property
located
within
that
military
enclave.
the
facts
are
that
in
1930,
the
22,000
acres
comprising
barksdale
air
force
base
were
transferred
by
the
city
of
shreveport,
the
state
of
louisiana
and
bossier
levee
board
to
the
federal
government
with
the
understanding
that
the
government
would
build
an
air
base
on
this
property.
now,
these
deeds
are
simple
deeds
with
no
--
no
reservations
of
any
consequence
whatever.
it
has
no
restriction
in
these
deeds
as
to
the
use
to
which
the
property
might
be
put.
in
other
words,
they
are
fee
simple
conveyances.
they
are
in
the
form
of
donations
as
my
opponent
will
point
out
later.
they're
in
the
form
of
donations
but
there
was
a
very
definite
understanding
that
in
pursuance
of
the
transfer
of
these
lands
to
the
government,
the
government
would
in
turn
build
this
air
base.
the
city
of
shreveport
actually
spent
several
millions
of
dollars
in
acquiring
these
lands
so
that
it
might
give
these
lands
to
the
government
in
exchange
for
the
installation
of
an
air
base
at
this
point.
today,
barksdale
air
force
base
is
one
of
the
great
air
bases
of
the
nation.
the
second
air
force
is
headquartered
there.
there
are
8000
people
on
duty,
either
military
personnel
or
government
employees.
there
are
1500
acres,
approximately
in
the
cantonment
area,
about
1500
acres
in
the
landing
street
proper
and
then
the
remainder
of
it
is
what
they
call
the
east
base
and
that
includes
the
land
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
the
--
the
air
--
entire
air
base
is
on
defense.
there
are
controlled
accesses.
the
public
can't
come
and
go
as
it
might
wish.
everyone
stopped
at
the
gate.
they
must
--
civilians
outside
must
have
business
on
the
base
in
order
to
visit
on
the
base.
these
matters
are
brought
out
on
the
deposition
of
colonel
hanlon,
the
base
commander
at
page
79
of
the
record.
in
1951,
it
was
determined
by
the
government
that
a
portion
of
the
base
was
being
drained
by
oil
and
gas
wells,
drilled
by
others
just
outside
the
base.
so
the
matter
was
taken
up
with
the
department
of
the
interior,
which
of
course
is
the
branch
of
the
government
that
deals
with
oil
and
gas
matters,
and
limited
jurisdiction
was
transferred
by
public
order
701
from
the
department
of
the
air
force
to
the
department
of
the
interior
for
the
purpose
of
leasing
for
oil
and
gas
so
that
the
government
might
--
following
the
practices
of
a
good
husbandman
--
get
some
revenues
out
of
these
oil
and
gas
deposits
underlying
the
government
property.
so
that
was
an
advertisement
for
oil
and
gas
leases.
and
the
people
that
we
represent
here
were
the
successful
bidders.
so
they
went
in
and
they
drilled
oil
and
gas
wells
under
the
terms
of
this
lease
and
i
might
say
that
the
lease
itself
provides
that
it
is
subject
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
air
force
and
that
--
that
the
--
in
other
words,
all
through
this
whole
matter
from
the
transfer
of
limited
jurisdiction
to
the
department
of
the
interior,
to
the
leasing
itself
that
runs
through
this
whole
thing,
the
idea
that
the
primary
use
of
the
property
is
for
military
purposes.
then
the
tax
assessor
of
bossier
parish,
louisiana
assessed
the
physical
properties
located
on
the
base
and
the
sheriff
undertook
to
collect
ad
valorem
taxes
on
the
pipe
and
on
the
engines,
on
the
machines,
on
the
derricks
and
all
other
equipment
placed
on
the
air
base
by
these
oil
and
gas
lessees.
mr.
o'quin
will
give
the
facts
of
his
case
but
they
vary
in
--
in
some
respects
from
--
from
our
own.
our
plants
paid
these
taxes,
ad
valorem
taxes
under
protest
and
filed
a
suit
under
louisiana
law
to
recover
the
taxes
so
paid
on
the
protest.
the
trial
court
held
for
the
sheriff
holding
that
in
line
with
a
--
a
case
that
had
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
murphy
corporation
versus
fontenot,
which
we
deal
within
our
brief
that
the
property
must
be
used
for
governmental
purposes
in
order
for
us
to
--
in
order
for
the
taxpayers
to
escape
taxation.
and
that
there
was
no
governmental
purpose
involved
in
producing
of
oil
and
gas
wells.
that
was
one
point.
in
other
words,
that
there
was
a
section,
section
k,
in
the
oil
and
gas
lease
which
says
that
the
lessee
must
pay
to
the
state
and
other
taxing
authorities,
all
taxes
lawfully
assessed
in
the
position
which
the
state
took,
was
that
--
that
was
a
command
that
all
--
that
these
taxes
be
paid
by
contract.
we
will
require
to
pay
these
taxes.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
that
was
a
--
a
--
that
the
state
has
to
contend
that
that
was
a
retrocession
of
--
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
the
united
states
giving
up
of
that
and
allowing
of
the
state
to
come
in
and
tax
through
this
contract.
the
third
point
was
that
the
--
the
leasing
of
a
portion
of
the
base
for
oil
and
gas
production
was
not
a
military
purpose
and
therefore,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
government
was
lost.
and
the
last
point
is
that
the
united
states
is
dependent
upon
the
public
schools
of
bossier
parish
for
the
children
of
the
military
personnel
so
that
they
might
receive
their
education
and
that
certain
utilities
are
furnished
to
the
base
by
the
state.
and
the
--
the
court
somehow
concludes
that
that
shows
an
intent
by
the
government
not
to
accept
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
area.
we,
of
course,
think
these
points
are
not
well
taken.
those
--
that
case
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
louisiana
and
we
applied
for
writs
to
the
state
supreme
court
which
were
denied,
and
then
we
came
to
this
honorable
court.
the
--
the
law
involved
is
the
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
article
1,
section
8,
clause
17
of
which
the
court
i'm
sure
is
quite
familiar,
that
says
that,
"the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
district,"
of
course
being
the
district
of
columbia,
"and
to
exercise
like
authority
over
all
places
purchased
by
the
consent
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
in
which
the
same
shall
be,
for
the
erection
of
forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
dock-yards,
and
other
needful
buildings."
so
the
next
question
is,
did
the
legislature
of
louisiana
consent
to
the
acquisition
of
this
military
base
by
the
government?
that
consent
comes
in
act
12
of
1892
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
where
this
consent
is
clearly
given.
that
act
says
that
the
united
states
shall
have
power
to
purchase
or
condemn
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
law
upon
making
just
compensation.
therefore,
any
land
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
not
already
in
use
for
public
purposes
required
for
custom
houses,
court
houses,
arsenals,
national
cemeteries,
or
for
other
purposes
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
section
2
of
the
act,
now
this
is
the
consent
part.
section
2
is
the
cession
part
of
the
act
which
independently,
over
the
constitutional
provision
i
referred
to,
conveys
over
to
the
federal
government
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
area
such
as
this.
this
is
very
broad
language
and
this
is
very
important,
if
your
honors
please,
to
our
case.
this
section
provides
that
the
united
states
may
enter
upon
and
occupy
any
land
which
may
have
been
or
may
be
purchased
or
condemned
or
otherwise
acquired
and
shall
have
the
right
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
property
so
acquired
during
the
time
that
the
united
states
shall
be
or
remained
only
thereof,
for
all
purposes
except
the
administration
of
these
criminal
laws
in
the
state
and
except
for
the
service
of
civil
and
criminal
process.
and
we
think
that
act
is
very
significant.
it
was
in
effect,
it
was
the
law
of
louisiana
in
1930
when
these
lands
were
acquired
by
the
federal
government
and
when
the
air
field
was
established
at
this
point.
the
government
clearly
had,
we
say,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
area.
now,
the
legislature
of
louisiana
in
1942
even
went
further
and
says,
"the
consent
of
the
state
of
louisiana
is
hereby
given
in
accordance
with
the
17th
clause,
8th
section
of
the
first
article
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
the
acquisition
by
the
united
state
by
purchase
condemnation
or
otherwise
of
any
lands
in
the
state
requiring
for
forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
and
so
on."
then
the
second
section
of
that
act
says
that,
"the
united
states
may
enter
upon
and
occupy
any
land
in
the
state
of
louisiana
which
it
did
has
heretofore
acquired
or
may
hereafter
acquire
by
purchase,
condemnation,
lease
or
otherwise
required
for
sites
for
forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
dock-yards
and
other
needful
buildings,
or
for
any
other
purpose
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
and
shall
have
the
right
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
properties
so
acquired
during
the
time
that
the
united
states
shall
be
or
remain
the
owner
or
lessee
thereof
for
all
purposes
except
the
state
reserves
the
right
to
serve
civil
and
criminal
process."
now,
in
this
act,
the
state
even
gave
up
of
the
provision
in
the
early
act
that
is
criminal
law
should
prevail
over
this
area.
so
that,
after
1942,
the
state
had
reserved
no
authority
whatever
over
barksdale
air
force
base
except
to
serve
process,
absolutely
none.
now,
the
cases
say
clearly
that
since
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
an
area
such
as
barksdale
air
force
base,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
lost
the
right
to
tax
thereon.
the
leading
case
is
surplus
trading
company
versus
cook
decided
by
this
honorable
court
sometime
ago,
holding
that
the
tax
laws
of
arkansas
could
not
apply
to
private
property
located
on
camp
pike,
arkansas.
this
has
been
followed
in
standard
oil
company
of
california
versus
--
standard
oil
company
versus
california
where
this
court
held
that
california
cannot
impose
a
license
tax
on
the
sale
of
gasoline
within
military
reservations.
many
other
courts
have
followed
the
same
holding
in
yellowstone
park
transportation
company
against
gallatin
county.
the
ninth
circuit
with
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
held
that
montana
had
consented
to
the
purchase
or
acquisition
by
the
government
of
yellowstone
park
and
therefore,
montana
could
not
tax
private
property
located
within
yellowstone
park.
let's
say
there
are
many
--
many
other
cases
state
and
federal
that
have
followed
the
same
principle
of
law,
so
we
say
that
that
is
one
principle
that
is
well-settled.
the
state
of
kentucky,
the
appellate
court
of
that
state
in
1963
in
a
case
on
all
force
with
the
present
one
held
opposite
to
the
louisiana
courts
in
this
matter.
in
that
case,
camp
breckinridge,
kentucky
was
involved.
a
portion
of
the
reservation
was
leased
--
excuse
me
--
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
it
was
a
private
property
located
on
the
lease
portion
and
there
was
the
contention
by
the
state
taxing
authorities
that
on
a
count
of
the
granting
of
an
oil
and
gas
lease
which
is
foreign
to
military
affairs,
the
--
the
state
had
--
was
given
by
the
federal
government
the
right
to
tax
personal
property,
exactly
the
same
thing
is
being
contended
by
the
state
here.
and
the
kentucky
appellate
court
held
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
had
been
maintained
over
that
area.
in
these
cases,
the
--
that
was
dealt
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
had
been
lost
by
certain
uses
which
were
not
military,
where
we've
got
military
bases.
for
example,
in
united
states
against
unzeuta.
in
that
case,
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
a
crime
was
committed
on
a
right-of-way,
which
had
been
granted
to
a
railroad
by
the
united
states
government
in
that
case,
and
a
contention
was
made
that
the
united
states
did
not
have
the
exclusive
right
to
try
this
man.
the
--
the
murder
was
committed
or
the
crime
was
committed
in
a
boxcar
located
on
this
right-of-way
which
had
been
granted
by
the
united
states
to
the
railroad.
and
the
contention
was
made
that
that
had
been
separated
from
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
state
have
the
right
to
--
(inaudible)
had
the
right
to
try
this
man.
but
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
--
the
fact
that
the
rail
--
railroad
right-of-way
had
been
granted
to
private
interest
did
not
deprive
the
united
states
of
exclusive
jurisdictional
of
the
area.
similarly,
in
benson
against
the
united
states,
a
portion
of
fort
leavenworth
was
used
--
being
used
as
a
farm
and
of
--
a
crime
was
committed
on
this
farm,
and
the
contention
was
made
that
the
united
states
had
lost
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
area
because
it
was
not
using
it
for
military
purposes.
and
this
court
held
that
that
made
no
difference,
that
it
was
still
a
part
of
the
reservation,
and
that
the
united
states
still
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
area
comprising
the
farm.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
yes,
your
honor.
that
point
is
made
by
counsel
in
his
brief.
now,
that
point
had
not
been
raised
earlier
in
this
case
and
for
that
reason,
it's
not
dealt
with
in
our
main
brief.
but
mr.
o'quin,
in
the
supplemental
brief
filed
with
the
court,
has
dealt
with
the
problem
of
the
--
whether
it's
a
purchase
or
not.
in
arlington
hotel
company
against
fant,
a
portion
of
hot
springs
national
park
was
leased
by
the
government
to
private
interest
and
the
private
commercial
hotels
built
there.
and
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
arkansas
had
the
right
to
pass
laws
with
reference
to
this
hotel
and
regulate
barbering
within
it.
and
this
court
held
that
even
though
there
was
a
lease
to
private
interest
of
this
hotel
on
the
government
reservation
over
which
the
government
had
exclusive
jurisdiction,
nevertheless,
the
government
retained
such
exclusive
jurisdiction.
the
government
itself
is
much
interested
in
this
case
as
your
honors
have
observed
because
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
in
this
case
of
a
very
able
brief
indicating
the
interest
of
the
government
and
the
views
of
the
government
happen
happily
to
coincide
with
those
of
the
petitioners.
the
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
brief
that
this
isn't
an
important
question
because
there
are
approximately
5000
areas
or
enclaves
where
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
it
says
it
has
it,
throughout
the
country.
and
this
involves
approximately
one
million
people
who
reside
on
these
enclaves.
so
it's
a
question
of
considerable
moment
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
states
have
the
right
to
make
in
roads
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
over
these
areas.
there
has
--
there
has
been
published
a
very
able
work
entitled
jurisdiction
over
federal
areas
within
the
states
by
the
interdepartmental
committee
for
the
study
of
jurisdiction
over
federal
areas
here
in
the
government,
and
it
was
compound
under
the
chairmanship
of
an
assistant
attorney
general,
a
very
able
and
comprehensive
work.
in
that
--
in
that
report,
we
find
part
1,
page
29
that
it
has
been
the
historic
policy
of
the
government
to
require
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
areas.
this
was
in
effect
for
some
hundred
years
since
the
history
of
our
country.
it
wasn't
until
1940
that
congress
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
informal
acceptance
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
areas.
prior
to
that
time,
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
automatic
if
it
fit
in
with
the
scheme
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
clause
17.
part
2
of
this
report,
page
177,
it
has
said,
"exclusive
federal
legislation
jurisdiction,
it
seems
well
settled,
serves
to
immu
--
serves
to
immunize
from
state
taxation
privately
owned
properties
located
on
an
area
subject
to
such
jurisdiction."
at
this
point,
i
should
like
to
note
that
in
murphy
corporation
versus
fontenot,
which
is
the
case
on
which
the
courts
in
louisiana
in
this
case
depend,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
held
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
actually
acquired
over
barksdale
air
force
base.
it
actually
vested
in
the
government,
but
that
the
government
lost
it
by
the
granting
of
this
oil
and
gas
lease.
in
page
10
of
the
sheriff's
brief
in
this
case,
he
admits
that
the
--
that
the
legislature
of
louisiana
had
ceded
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
over
barksdale,
but
had
lost
it
on
account
of
this
oil
and
gas
activity
and
other
reasons.
now,
if
--
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
clear
that
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
over
federal
areas
is
a
most
important
thing.
now,
this
--
the
louisiana
courts
have
held
that
if
somebody
in
the
department
of
the
interior
grants
an
oil
and
gas
lease
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
and
there's
a
clause
in
there
that
says
that
a
lessee
must
pay
--
must
pay
state
taxes
when
lawfully
due,
then
the
granting
of
that
lease
are
some
clerical
question
perhaps
in
the
bureau
of
land
management,
binds
the
united
states
and
releases
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
gives
to
the
state
the
right
to
tax.
then
in
that
decision
of
--
of
the
state
court
in
the
murphy,
fontenot
case,
they
talk
about
offense
that
separates
the
oil
and
gas
part
from
the
military
part
of
the
area
and
they
say
that
--
that
shows
an
abandonment
of
that
portion
of
the
military
area
and
where
the
oil
and
gas
wells
are
located.
so
that
we
are
wondering
what
will
happen
if
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
lost
when
the
last
drop
of
oil
is
produced
and
the
last
cubic
feet
of
gas
is
produced,
then
what
happens?
under
the
state's
theory,
would
the
government
come
back
and
resume
exclusive
jurisdiction?
is
it
going
to
depend
on
the
existence
and
validity
of
an
oil
and
gas
lease?
suppose
the
fence
is
moved
one
way
or
another,
few
hundred
yards,
is
--
is
that
going
to
be
controlling
on
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
area?
we
say
that
those
things
don't
make
sense,
that
those
things
are
entirely
too
tenuous
to
regulate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
in
the
interdepartmental
report
to
which
i've
referred,
it
says
and
we
agree
that
only
congress
has
the
right
to
retrocede
to
the
states
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
over
areas
such
as
this,
once
exclusive
jurisdiction
has
been
acquired
by
the
federal
government,
and
that
it
cannot
be
done
in
any
other
way
except
by
the
congress.
to
illustrate,
congress
has
passed
the
buck
act
which
retrocedes
to
the
states
the
right
to
levy
income
tax
and
sales
and
used
taxes
over
exclusive
federal
areas.
then
came,
the
hayden-cartwright
act
where
oil
and
gas
products
could
be
taxed
by
the
state.
so
obviously,
the
congress
felt
that
states
had
no
right
to
levy
these
taxes
or
it
wouldn't
have
passed
those
acts
giving
the
states
those
rights.
and
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
filed
here,
there's
a
note
which
shows
that
they
found
29
instances
where
there
had
been
a
retrocession
by
congress
to
the
states
of
the
right
to
tax
and
do
other
things
over
these
exclusive
federal
areas.
and
we
say
--
and
the
government
says
that
it
is
necessary
that
there'd
be
congressional
action
in
order
for
the
state
to
be
granted
the
right
to
tax
over
areas
such
as
this
that
we
have
here.
the
principal
points
of
the
sheriff
in
this
case
seem
to
be
clustered
around
the
idea
that
although
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
admittedly
in
the
federal
government,
it's
been
lost
by
the
granting
of
this
lease.
it's
been
lost
by
the
erection
of
this
fence
that
they
keep
talking
in
--
talking
about.
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
there
is
no
military
purpose
in
the
use
of
this
portion
of
the
base
for
the
production
of
oil
and
gas.
well,
our
answer
to
that
is
that
first
of
all,
the
base
commander
said
clearly
in
his
deposition,
that
even
though
there
--
there's
a
--
a
few
oil
and
gas
wells
around
and
incidentally,
that
it
has
regulation
about
the
derricks
and
regulation
about
everything
else
so
that
the
military
use
is
--
is
primary
but
the
commander
goes
onto
say
that
even
in
this
area,
it
is
used
for
military
purposes
and
he
spells
them
out.
it's
a
survival
training
area,
a
tip
--
a
--
a
wingtip
tank
drop
area
and
he
spells
out
a
number
of
others
where
they
use
this
very
land
for
military
purposes
today.
then
we
get
to
the
argument
about
the
--
about
the
schools
and
the
--
and
the
public
utilities.
i
suppose
that
the
theorem
of
the
state
must
be
in
order
to
maintain
your
exclusive
jurisdiction,
a
federal
area
must
be
entirely
self
sufficient.
you
must
have
your
own
schools.
you
must
have
your
own
electric
plant
and
your
own
water
scheme
and
everything
else.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
is
not
very
sound
that
you
lose
your
exclusive
jurisdiction
if
you
rely
on
the
state
for
public
utilities
and
for
furnishing
the
schools
for
the
children
of
the
base.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
in
conclusion
at
this
point,
i'm
merely
going
to
say
that
i
think
we
should
stick
to
the
fundamentals
here.
we
should
stick
to
the
constitutional
provision.
we
think
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
government
was
established
pursuant
to
that
provision.
secondly,
another
avenue
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
entirely
independent
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
clause
17,
is
the
voluntary
cession
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
the
federal
government
over
areas
such
as
this,
of
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
that
exclusive
jurisdiction,
once
having
large
as
it
admittedly
was
here
cannot
be
this
large
except
by
act
of
congress,
and
we
have
not
had
an
act
of
congress
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
should
like
to
use
the
--
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
should
like
to
use
the
time
remaining
between
now
and
recess
time
to
discuss
a
--
few
of
the
points
counsel
has
made.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
beginning
with
the
--
the
idea
that
the
argument,
that
there
must
be
a
purchase
--
of
course
we
realize
that
time
is
used
in
the
--
in
clause
17
of
the
constitution
we've
been
talking
about.
and
the
counsel
has
said
that
because
these
transfers
were
donations,
the
constitutional
provision
does
not
apply.
at
the
outset,
i
would
remind
the
court
that
we
have
said
that
there
are
two
avenues
to
exclusive
jurisdiction.
one
is
this
way
and
the
other
is
by
this
voluntary
cession
by
the
state
to
the
federal
government
which
took
place
here
also.
so
that
even
if
the
court
agrees
with
counsel
that
there
was
no
purchase
here,
and
therefore
that
the
congressional
--
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
not
operative
here,
he
still
is
not
attacked
by
this
argument
the
other
avenue
to
exclusive
jurisdiction.
but
we
think
that
this
is
a
purchase
as
contemplated
by
the
constitutional
provision.
i
should
like
to,
at
this
time,
refer
to
the
stipulation,
counsel
in
this
case,
which
of
course
is
overwriting
and
governing
here.
now,
on
page
17
of
the
record,
it
says,
"the
conveyances
evidenced
by
the
instruments
referred
to
were
donations
of
the
properties
described
therein,
made
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
louisiana
upon
the
condition
and
with
the
understanding
that
the
united
states
would
establish,
operate
and
maintain
a
military
air
force
base
upon
the
lands
conveyed."
now,
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
we
have
what's
known
as
"commutative
contracts"
and
article
1768
of
the
revised
civil
code
says
this."
commutative
contracts
are
those
in
which
what
is
done,
given
or
premised
by
one
party
is
considered
as
equivalent
to
or
a
consideration
for
what
is
done,
given
or
premised
by
the
other."
article
1770
says,
"a
contract
containing
mutual
covenants
shall
be
presumed
to
be
commutative
unless
the
contrary
be
expressed."
we
say
this
is
no
more
than
a
commutative
contract
under
the
law
of
louisiana.
further,
we
think
that
the
--
the
general
definition
in
the
legal
dictionaries
and
in
many
cases
is
that
the
term
"purchase"
in
law
covers
all
contractual
conveyances.
it
--
the
time
would
exclude
only
title
acquired
by
descent
and
inheritance.
in
the
case
of
kohl,
k-o-h-l,
against
the
united
states,
91
u.s.
367
cited
by
mr.
o'quin
in
his
brief,
the
word
"purchase"
there,
he
said
to
mean
acquisition
by
contract
between
the
parties,
any
acquisition
by
contract,
so
that
--
we
think
the
position
that
there
was
a
purchase
in
this
case
as
contemplated
by
the
constitution.
i
was
somewhat
shocked
when
counsel
said
that
in
the
conveyances
of
the
land
to
the
government
in
this
case,
there
was
a
restriction
to
military
use.
i
was
shocked
because
that's
been
brought
up
for
the
very
first
time
in
this
case
today.
but
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record
beginning
at
page
59
and
going
onto
page
70,
therein
are
the
conveyances
themselves.
and
it's
true
that
there
is
some
language
in
some
of
the
resolutions
saying
that
whereas
the
government
wishes
to
acquire
these
lands
was
military
purposes
of
its
own.
your
honors
know
i
am
sure
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
will
not
accept
title
to
land
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
unless
it
is
in
fee
simple.
and
in
all
three
of
the
deeds,
the
title
is
very
clearly
conveyed
in
fee
simple.
there
is
only
one
minor
exception
in
the
case
of
the
deed
by
the
city
of
shreveport.
there
is
a
reservation
of
--
for
two
years
until
1932
of
the
right
to
produce
some
gas
wells
which
were
producing
at
the
time
of
the
conveyance
in
1930.
that's
the
only
reservation
in
those
deeds,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
yes,
your
honor
that
was
--
he
was
the
officer
of
the
government
designated
to
accept
title
in
fee
simple
on
behalf
of
the
government.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
--
i
would
think
so.
he
was
instructed
to
--
to
do
that
thing
which
was
in
fact
done
and
the
title
is
in
fee
simple.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
meaning
that
requirement
of
the
government.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
think
your
--
i
think
your
honor
perhaps
has
in
mind
s.r.a.
versus
minnesota
--
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
--
which
has
been
discussed
here.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
but
we
have
--
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
case
whatever.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
--
a
transfer
of
the
possession
of
that
property.
it
was
a
--
in
effect,
the
transfer
of
title
and
all
the
government
was
doing
there
was
to
reserve
a
security
device
so
that
the
deferred
part
of
the
consideration
might
be
secured.
actually
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
that
was
a
conveyance
because
the
government
had
seized
the
use
the
property
for
any
governmental
purposes
whatever.
it
had
been
turned
over
to
the
private
owners
and
they
were
using
it
for
private
purposes,
and
it
was
merely
a
reservation
of
a
security
device
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
had
--
had
the
government
--
had
the
government
departed
with
title,
yes
your
honor,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
--
i
don't'
quite
understand.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
the
--
the
--
is
the
government
conveying?
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
would
think
that
when
the
title
does
revert,
then
the
situation
would
be
governed
by
the
statutes
of
louisiana
which
says
that
the
government
is
granted
exclusive
jurisdiction
if
it
acquires
land
in
the
state
for
--
for
any
purpose
whatever.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
the
--
you
--
you
said
the
government
--
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
you
said
the
government
--
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
you
mean
until
--
until
the
government
gets
title
back.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
i
--
i'm
not
--
yes,
we
believe
that
--
that
it
could
tax
because
the
state
has
departed
absolutely
within
it
vested
your
title,
it
seem
to
me
during
that
time.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
that
was
contested
in
the
--
in
the
cases
that
the
counsel
has
referred
to
and
those
--
the
state
of
louisiana
held
in
that
case
that
we
had
to
pay
those
taxes
because
there's
the
--
the
federal
government
has
given
up
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
we
think
it's
an
erroneous
holding,
if
your
honor
please.
i'd
like
to
comment
just
a
minute
about
the
case
of
paul
versus
united
states
and
the
other
cases
in
line
with
that
decision.
we
have
--
we
have
no
complaint
whatever
about
the
holding
in
the
james
stewart
&
company
versus
sadrakula
or
the
old
chicago
rock
island
and
pacific
railway
company
against
mcglynn.
in
that
line
of
cases,
what
the
court
was
saying
as
i
appreciate
it
is
this.
that
when
sovereignty
is
transferred
by
one
sovereignty
to
another,
the
law
abhors
a
void
so
that
as
to
the
laws
regulating
matters
as
between
individuals
in
that
enclave,
the
law
of
the
whole
sovereign
will
remain.
that
is
municipal
law.
it
will
remain
but
it
will
be
adopted
as
the
law
of
the
new
sovereign
unless
and
until
there
are
legislative
acts
by
the
new
sovereign
to
regulate
those
matters
as
between
private
individuals
on
the
domain.
that's
what
i
appreciate
that
those
holdings
to
be
and
we
have
no
complaint
about
them.
we
just
simply
don't
think
they
have
any
application
whatever
in
--
in
a
situation
like
this.
we
conclude
as
the
solicitor
general
concluded
in
his
brief
that
like
the
authority
to
sell
or
transfer
government
lands,
citing
alabama
versus
texas,
the
authority
to
retrocede
jurisdiction
must
be
bound
in
some
act
of
congress
and
citing
offutt
housing
company
versus
sappy
county.
so
we
conclude
that
in
the
absence
of
a
congressional
act
retroceding
to
the
state
of
louisiana
the
right
to
tax,
it
does
not
and
cannot
have
such
right
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
would
you
repeat
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
clarence
l.
yancey
we
--
we
say
louisiana
have
--
does
not
have
the
right
