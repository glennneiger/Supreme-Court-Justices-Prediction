if

the
humble
pipe
line
company
is
the
owner
of
two
interstate
oil
pipelines
that
extend
to
--
to
a
nine-tenths
miles
within
the
barksdale
airport
base
limits.
those
lines
were
assessed
for
ad
valorem
taxes
in
1853
at
--
at
standard
values
by
the
louisiana
tax
commission
and
a
state
in
its
political
subdivisions,
levied
taxes
upon
those
assessments,
ad
valorem
taxes
for
the
year
1953.
those
taxes
were
paid
under
protest
in
this
suit
filed
to
recover
the
taxes
paid
on
the
ground
that
the
--
the
state
and
its
subdivisions
were
without
territorial
jurisdiction
to
levy
the
taxes
within
the
governmental
enclave
or
which
the
united
states
had
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
the
--
the
difference
in
the
case
of
humble
pipe
line
company
and
the
natural
gas
and
oil
and
mississippi
river
fuel
cases
is
in
the
fact
that
the
pipelines
of
humble
do
not
traverse
any
portion.
no
part
of
the
pipe
--
pipelines
of
humble
traverse
any
portion
of
the
area
that
was
subjected
to
the
oil,
gas
and
mineral
leases
that
were
sub
--
that
were
left
to
natural
gas
and
oil
company
and
mississippi
river
fuel
corporation.
there
--
there
is
no
relationship
between
humble
pipe
line
and
those
persons
who
are
producing
oil,
none
whatever
and
the
humble
pipe
line
company
has
transported
no
oil
from
the
base
nor
is
it
related
in
any
manner
with
the
production
of
oil
from
the
base.
the
--
in
this
case,
the
state
concedes
that
the
united
states
has
exclusive
legislative
authority
within
barksdale
air
force
base.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
momentarily
whether
--
whether
or
not
the
state
had
raised
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
of
jurisdiction
within
the
constitutional
provision,
article
1,
section
8.
and
that
point
has
been
raised,
we
have
contended
--
humble
contends
that
the
source
of
jurisdiction
is
two-fold.
first,
that
it
arises
under
the
article
of
the
constitution
and
second,
that
it
rises
under
the
cession
law
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
these
lands
were
transferred
to
the
united
states.
we
contend
first
that
--
that
this
--
these
properties
were
assembled
by
the
city
of
shreveport
for
the
purpose
as
permitted
by
the
constitution
of
the
state,
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
them
to
the
united
states
for
the
erection
of
an
airport
or
--
for
military
purposes
and
that
that
was
the
--
that
the
acceptance
of
that
donation
so-called
was
authorized
by
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
before
those
transfers
were
made.
in
other
words,
we
submit
that
this
was
a
negotiated
acquisition
that
it
was
by
contract,
the
consideration
for
of
which
was
the
erection
of
the
military
establishment
and
it
was
just
as
much
a
purchase
as
though
it
had
been
made
--
that
the
conveyance
had
been
made
for
a
monetary
consideration.
that
--
mr.
leon
o'quin
1yes,
your
honor.
and
we
submit
--
actually,
the
--
the
--
they
had
--
there
have
been
some
cases
which
inferentially
have
attempted
to
say
that
that
was
the
broad
meaning
of
the
term
and
that
--
under
the
constitution
that
they
met
a
purchase
in
its
more
limited
sense.
but
in
this
case,
i
submit,
that
the
source
of
the
jurisdiction
is
unimportant
for
the
reason
that
particularly,
in
respect
to
humble
pipe
line,
because
no
part
of
our
line
traverses
any
portion
of
the
area
which
has
been
leased
for
the
production
of
oil
and
gas.
and
the
matter
of
the
source
of
the
jurisdiction
could
be
relevant
only
in
respect
to
the
matter
of
abandonment
of
that
area.
if
--
if
jurisdiction
is
conceded
in
respect
to
the
post
area
outside
of
the
2000
acres
that
were
subject
to
the
oil
and
gas
lease,
then
humble
pipe
line
is
entirely
within
that
area
and
there
is
no
question
of
any
abandonment
of
any
portion
of
that
area
or
any
discontinuance
of
any
for
--
part
of
the
use
of
that
area.
the
--
as
i
--
as
i
stated
this
--
the
--
the
respondent
here
has
conceded
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
on
page
10
of
its
brief.
it
first
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
do
not
agree
that
--
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
arises
under
the
article
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
but
it's
stated,
"the
conclusion
therefore,
is
inescapable
that
the
united
states
did
not
acquire
by
the
weight
of
said
constitutional
provision
alone,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
lands
in
question."
however,
the
consent
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
the
donations
as
contained
in
act
12
of
1892
and
later
amended
by
act
31
of
1942,
embodied
in
louisiana
revised
statutes,
ceded
pursuant
to
its
provisions
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
over
the
land
so
required.
and
further,
the
counsel
has
already
pointed
out
that
in
the
act
of
cession
which
was
in
effect
in
1930,
that
there
was
no
condition
imposed
upon
that
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
conceded,
i'm
sure,
that
a
state
may
consent
to
the
purchase
or
condemnation
of
lands
for
public
--
for
governmental
uses
and
impose
any
condition
upon
that
consent
that
it
may
see
fit.
and
further,
in
ceding
jurisdiction,
it
may
impose
any
conditions
upon
that
cession
that
it
sees
fit.
but
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
condition
imposed
upon
the
cession
that
would
require
the
contingent
use
of
the
property
as
for
a
military
base.
as
i
say,
that
is
beyond
humble's
case,
but
i
submit
that
regardless
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
cession
that
requires
a
continued
use
as
for
example,
in
cases
in
the
past,
when
there
had
been
such
uses,
it
have
said
that
the
--
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
was
suspended
so
long
as
the
military
use
might
be
discontinued.
but
here,
we
have
a
cession
that
says
that
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
so
long
as
the
lands
are
owned
by
the
united
states.
in
this
instance,
the
--
the
respondent
conceding
that
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction,
attempts
to
avoid
the
effect
of
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
pointing
out
that
for
example,
stated
by
counsel,
children
of
the
post
attend
schools
of
the
county
or
parish,
upon
payment
of
a
tuition
fee.
and
by
that
fact,
we
submit
that
the
respondent
concedes
--
the
state
concedes
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
over
the
post
area
and
because
if
the
state
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
there,
they
would
be
obligated
to
accept
those
children
in
the
schools
of
the
parish
and
of
the
state
without
the
payment
of
the
tuition.
the
only
thing
--
the
only
thing
that
--
that
is
pointed
toward
the
case
of
humble
here
is
the
statement
by
the
courts
below
that
the
--
that
the
united
states
either
acquired
these
lands
subject
to
an
easement
or
servitude,
a
right
of
way
in
favor
of
humble
or
it
subsequently
granted
a
right
of
way.
it
--
of
course
the
contention
is
answered
entirely
by
the
case
of
united
states
versus
unzeuta
cited
by
counsel
because
in
that
instance,
they
referred
particularly
to
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
incompatible,
inconsistent
with
the
servitude
or
easement
over
the
property
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
but
actually
in
this
instance,
first
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
ever
was
an
easement
or
servitude.
there's
nothing
actually
to
show
in
--
by
what
means
this
pipeline
is
--
is
traverse
--
is
the
property
of
the
united
states.
these
things
have
crept
in
without
their
having
been
any
affirmative
pleading
in
the
case,
and
we've
made
no
objection
because
we
don't
--
we
really
have
no
objection
in
having
them
referred
to
them.
i
would
state
simply
that
insofar
as
the
case
of
humble
pipeline
company
is
concern,
there
is
nothing
to
differentiate
that
case
from
surplus
trading
company
versus
cook,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
--
under
similar
circumstances
that
the
state
of
arkansas
could
not
impose
ad
valorem
taxes
upon
private
property
within
ten
pike.
i
submit
that
it's
entirely
the
same.
the
matter
has
been
briefly
stated
in
the
memorandum
by
the
united
states
here
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
