mr.
yancey,
does
the
respondent
make
anything
that
the
point
that
this
property
was
not
purchased
as
--
and
--and
article
1,
section
8,
cl.
17
refers
only
to
property
which
is
purchased.
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
this
property
was
donated
or
given
to
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
--
one
meaning
of
the
word
purchase
is
any
acquisition
other
than
by
inheritance,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
judge
hutcheson
in
that
fifth
circuit
case,
distinguishes
severance
tax
and
he
said
it
would
--
that
tax
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
not
--
was
not
imposed
on
the
property
within
the
enclave
but
in
any
event
we
don't
have
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
severance
tax
here
that
may
or
may
not
be
distinguishable.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
--
this
is
clearly
a
tax
on
personal
property.
justice
potter
stewart
ad
valorem
tax
on
personal
property
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
within
the
enclave,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
whether
or
not
the
fifth
circuit
was
right
in
this
in
describing
that
other
kind
of
a
tax,
that
question
is
not
before
us
now.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
tax
is
directly
on
that
personal
property.
