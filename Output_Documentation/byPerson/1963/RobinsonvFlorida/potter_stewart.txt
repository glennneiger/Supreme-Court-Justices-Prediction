suppose
that's
true
by
house
thereto,
isn't
it?

you
can't
build
a
house
without
a
building
permit.

the
zoning

inspection
laws
as
to
plumbing
and
electricity
and
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
presume
they
have
in
florida.
they
do
in
--
also
in
our
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
both
of
those
cases
i
suggest
there
maybe
a
difference,
two
differences.
first,
you're
dealing
with
a
monopoly,
a
regulated
monopoly.
and
secondly,
you're
dealing
with
instrumentalities
of
commerce,
isn't
it
true?
justice
potter
stewart
my
guess
is
only
this
that
if
you
have
a
--
only
one
mass
transportation
monopoly,
then
this
is
the
only
way
people
can
ride,
who
--
who
need
to
use
a
mass
transportation.
if
you
have
1500
or
2000
restaurants
in
--
in
dade
county,
florida
presumably
some
of
them
will
choose
to
serve
only
white
people,
some
of
them
may
choose
to
serve
only
negro
customers,
some
may
chose
to
serve
both.

the
basis
is
not
the
"get
out".
the
basis
was
the
refusal
to
leave
after
being
told
to
get
out,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
--
a
--
i
suppose
it's
conceivable
that
in
a
defense
for
--
to
a
trespass
charge,
you
could
say,
"he
didn't
tell
me
to
get
out,"
or
--
or
while
he
said
it,
"you
really
didn't
mean
it,"
which
is
at
least
possible.
