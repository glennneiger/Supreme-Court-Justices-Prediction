(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

but
then
the
logical
presumption
would
be
that

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
that
admission
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does

and
if

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
(inaudible)
would
be
invalid.
justice

supposed

but
you
apply

generally
to

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
would
be
the
practical
fact
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
by

or
a

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

well,
under
your
statute
it's
authorized
the

owner
that
after

--
justice

--
would

goldberg
consider
you
are
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.

i
don't
follow
it
here.
you

that
in
the

criminal

you
can
(inaudible),
get
out,
and
that

not
the
case
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
suppose
(inaudible).
then
the
question
your
legislature
comes
with
when
it
enacted
the
statute
is
to
find
specifically
if
it
deals
with
an
interference
(inaudible).
then
my
question
is
how
do
(inaudible)
and
charged
by
showing
the
amount
of
(inaudible).
then
it
could
be
said
that
the
(inaudible).
is
this
not
where
you
apply
(inaudible)
not
just
undesirable
and
unlawful?
(inaudible)
to
find
why
a
person
must
be
accused
(inaudible),
he
could
be
only
made
or
it
could
be
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
was
construed
by
your

in
the
last
phase
other
than
in
this
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
this
