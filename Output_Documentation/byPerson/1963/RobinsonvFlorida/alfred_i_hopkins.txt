mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
the
florida
which
affirms
certain
criminal
convictions
by
the
criminal
court
of
record
in
the
--
for
dade
county,
florida
involving
18
appellants.
the
adjudication
by
the
trial
court
was
head
pursuant
to
section
509.141
of
the
florida
statutes.
this
chapter
of
this
section
is
set
forth
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
of
appellants'
main
brief.
to
begin
with
an
analysis
of
the
statute,
so
we'll
know
what
the
case
is
about,
the
statute
is
rather
unwieldy
piece
of
legislation
provides
in
essence
insofar
as
it
is
germane
to
this
case
that
if
any
person
enter
a
restaurant
and
if
his
presence
or
continued
presence
is,
among
other
reasons,
in
the
opinion
of
the
management,
thought
to
be
detrimental
to
the
business,
then
the
manager
may
request
that
this
patron
leave
the
premises.
if
the
patron
declines
to
leave,
the
manager
may
then
call
the
police.
he's
telling
the
client
to
leave,
he
is
deemed
to
be
illegally
on
the
premises
and
subject
to
arrest
and
conviction
for
misdemeanor.
the
statute
also
provides
for
certain
other
criteria
of
undesirability
such
as
persons
being
intoxicated,
immoral,
profane,
lewd
or
brawling,
but
then
at
the
end,
it
has
this
rather
generalized
provision
that
any
other
person
who,
in
the
opinion
of
the
management,
is
--
is
--
the
presence
of
such
a
person
would
be
detrimental
to
the
business,
and
that
person
maybe
ejected
from
the
premises.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
the
continue
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
not
in
terms
of
food.
they
were
seated,
if
i
may
explain
from
the
beginning
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
they
took
seats.
let
me,
if
i
may
your
honor
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i
wish
i
had
seen
the
point
of
the
trial
court.
we
didn't
raise
that
particular
issue
but
they
were
never
served
any
food
at
all.
what
happened
was
this.
the
appellants,
constituting
18
persons
and
being
both
negroes
and
white
persons
in
association
with
negroes,
entered
into
a
--
a
department
store
in
miami,
florida
called
shell's
city.
the
shell's
city
has
19
departments,
one
of
which
is
a
restaurant.
it
serves
the
public,
negro
and
white
alike,
without
discrimination
in
18
of
the
departments
but
in
the
restaurant,
it
draws
the
color
bar.
prior
to
the
incident
in
question,
which
gave
rise
to
these
criminal
prosecutions,
there
had
been
two
other
attempted
sit-in
demonstrations.
they're
mentioned
very
briefly
in
the
record
and
the
consequences
of
them
are
not
set
forth
in
the
record.
on
this
particular
day,
which
was
on
august
of
1960,
the
appellants
walked
into
the
restaurant
in
this
department
store,
sat
down
in
about
five
tables.
they
were
not
served
when
they
sat
down
and
they
waited
for
service.
they
waited
for
about
a
half-an-hour.
at
the
end
of
the
half
hour
period,
one
of
the
appellants
got
up
from
the
table,
walked
over
to
a
mr.
george
mckelvey.
mr.
mckelvey
is
the
vice
president
of
shell's
city
and
he
is
also
a
general
manager
of
the
store.
the
appellant
asked
mr.
mckelvey
could
he
be
served.
mr.
mckelvey
said,
“no”.
the
appellant
said,
"why?"
he
said,
"i
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
you."
at
that
point,
the
appellant
went
back
to
join
the
group
and
sat
down.
then
mr.
mckelvey
got
on
the
phone
and
called
--
called
the
police
and
told
them
what
was
happening
in
his
restaurant.
about
10
minutes
later,
a
policeman
arrived,
sergeant
john
suggs
of
the
miami
police
force.
he
then,
with
mr.
mckelvey,
walked
to
each
of
the
tables
and
mr.
mckelvey
again
made
his
request
to
the
appellants
that
they
leave.
they
again
declined
to
leave
whereupon
sergeant
suggs
took
them
all
into
custody.
now,
going
back
a
step,
while
they
were
in
the
restaurant,
there
were
other
persons,
white
persons
seated
there
and
were
being
served.
that
is
clear
from
the
record.
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
reason
for
his
refusal
of
service
was
the
fact
that
the
appellants
were
negroes
or
white
persons
in
association
with
negroes,
and
that,
in
his
opinion,
would
make
a
detrimental
to
any
--
longer
entertain
them.
so
the
source,
the
substance,
the
foundation
of
his
reason
for
refusing
to
serve
them
was
their
color
or
their
associations
with
persons
of
color.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
of
the
appellants
were
engage
in
any
boisterous
or
noisy
conduct.
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
comported
themselves
in
any
fashion
which
would
have
included
them
in
the
other
specific
provisions
of
section
509.141.
they
were
peaceful
at
all
times.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
hostile
crowd
gathered
about
the
--
the
group
of
appellants.
there
was
no
situation
that
would
have
erupted
into
violence.
no
indication
of
any
kind
of
situation
such
as
that.
the
facts
are
essentially
undisputed,
the
appellants
put
on
no
evidence
of
their
own.
however,
cross-examining
mr.
mckelvey
and
his
associate,
mr.
warren
williams,
also
a
vice
president
of
shell's
city,
certain
additional
facts
were
adduced,
which
i
think
should
lead
to
a
reversal
of
the
judgments
below.
mr.
williams,
when
he
was
questioned,
was
asked
why
the
people,
why
the
appellants
were
refused
service.
his
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
on
page
28,
your
honor,
between
pages
28
to
30.
i
wanted
to
point
out
mr.
williams'
statement
of
a
custom
prevailing
in
dade
county,
florida
at
that
time
which
was
august
of
1960,
some
three
years
and
two
months
ago.
he
indicated
not
once
but
on
four
different
occasions
that
there
was
a
custom
in
dade
county
not
to
serve
negro
and
white
people
in
the
same
restaurant.
and
he
indicated
that
--
and
it
said
that
this
custom
forced
him
to
do
what
he
did.
if
i
may
read
some
extracts
from
the
record,
at
the
top
of
page
29.
mr.
williams
answers
question
of
counsel.
first,
the
question
-
"do
you
know
why
these
people
were
refused
service
at
the
restaurant?"
answer
-
"well,
basically,
it
is
the
policy
of
shell's
city
not
to
serve
colored
people
in
their
restaurant."
"why?"
answer
-
"that
is
based
upon
the
customs,
the
habits,
and
what
we
believe
to
be
the
desire
of
the
majority
of
the
white
people
in
this
county."
again,
towards
the
bottom
of
page
29
in
talking
about
why
they
discriminate,
mr.
williams
again
answers,
"well,
it
goes
back
to
what
is
the
custom
that
is
the
tradition
of
what
is
basically
observed
in
dade
county
would
be
the
bottom
of
it."
again
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
at
a
later
point
in
my
argument,
i
wanted
to
--
to
make
this
position,
your
honor,
that
we
have
uncontradicted
in
the
record
a
statement
by
the
state's
own
witness
that
there
is
a
custom
prevalent
was
at
that
time
on
the
white
majority
in
dade
county,
which
compelled
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
to
segregate
and
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i
base
my
position,
your
honor,
on
the
dictum
of
justice
bradley
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
i
grant
you
it's
only
a
dictum
but
he
did
say
it.
if
i
may
read
from
his
statement
set
forth
on
page
27
of
appellants'
main
brief.
mr.
justice
bradley
said,
"civil
rights,
such
as
are
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
against
state
aggression,
cannot
be
impaired
by
the
wrongful
acts
of
individuals,
unsupported
by
state
authority
in
the
shape
of
law,
customs,
or
judicial
or
executive
proceedings."
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
your
honor,
i
have
not
found
a
case.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
your
honor,
i
haven't
found
such
a
case
and
this
question
in
my
mind
as
to
what
justice
bradley
meant
--
what
the
majority
of
the
court
meant.
also
a
fact
that
the
--
one
of
the
early
civil
rights
acts,
r.s.
1983
uses
the
word
"custom
or
law"
where
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i
am
suggesting
that
that
statute
repeats
the
same
language
and
that
that
may
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i'm
suggesting
that
it
may
well
have
been
adapters
of
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
when
they
use
the
word
"state",
we're
thinking
that
simply
of
the
agents
of
the
people,
that
is
the
legislators,
the
administrators,
the
judges
but
while
have
been
thinking
of
the
body
politic
itself.
for
example,
and
examples
are
rare
in
this
field,
but
in
the
case
of
neal
versus
delaware,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
delaware,
where
the
people
of
the
state
of
delaware
had
purported
to
disenfranchised
or
limit
the
franchise
to
white
people.
this
is
by
way
of
analogy
but
there
was
a
state
constitutional
provision
adopted
by
the
people
of
the
state
and
the
court
stated
in
the
--
the
supreme
court
stated
that
that
provision
was
void
because
it
was
repugnant
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
the
people
of
the
state
if
they
act
formally
and
politically,
acting
the
political
fashion
to
the
legalism
of
a
constitutional
provision
can
constitute
the
state.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
in
this
case
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
in
this
case,
we
have
the
evidence.
mr.
williams
stated
that
it
was
a
custom
of
the
majority
of
the
people.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
in
terry
and
adams
and
one
of
his
again
in
dictum
that
custom
could
have
the
force
of
law,
in
fact
be
stronger
than
the
law.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
your
honor,
i
don't
bother
my
case
entirely
on
that
ground
but
i
do
suggest
it
to
the
court
as
a
possible
way
of
resolving
this
case
because
i
say
the
authority
seems
to
be
slim
or
negligible,
so
i
did
feel
that
i
should
bring
that
idea
across
to
the
court
in
as
much
as
it
is
in
the
record
and
no
contradiction
by
any
of
the
state's
witnesses.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
a
further
statement
of
the
facts
insofar
as
they
involved
the
florida
restaurant
and
hotel
licensing
statute.
florida
has,
like
many
jurisdictions,
elaborate
regulations
and
statutory
provisions
governing
the
licensing
of
restaurants.
relevant
provisions
of
our
statute,
chapter
509
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellants'
main
brief.
the
statute
provides
that
no
one
may
operate
a
restaurant
unless
he
has
a
license.
the
statute
provides
for
the
establishment
of
the
hotel
and
restaurant
commission
which
provides
--
which
issues
the
licenses.
this
commission
is
set
up
to
encourage
the
public
health
safety
and
welfare,
safeguard
rather,
the
public
health,
safety
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
florida.
no
restaurant
maybe
built
until
its
building
plans
are
first
been
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
yes,
it
is
true.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
my
argument
will
be
or
i'll
make
it
now
that
the
licensing
requirements
and
this
infusion
of
state
activity
and
to
private
enterprise
would,
in
my
view,
be
limited
to
places
of
public
accomodation,
places
where
significant
community
interests
are
affected.
i
will
make
the
same
kind
of
argument
in
this
regard
as
counsel
yesterday
made
with
regard
to
the
limit
to
which
shelley
and
kraemer
should
be
extended.
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
shelley
and
kraemer
be
extended
to
the
privacy
or
the
intimacy
of
a
home.
i
think
the
court
has
the
power
and
certainly
has
in
many
other
fields
of
constitutional
law
limited
the
scope
of
certain
of
its
doctrines.
and
i
suggest
that
the
licensing
argument,
which
i'll
use
as
a
--
as
a
brief
label,
there's
no
reason
to
extend
it
to
the
home
that
it
can
be
limited
to
places
of
public
accommodation
or
situations
where
significant
public
interests
are
affected.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
that's
right
but
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
--
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
mr.
justice
stewart
was
suggesting,
what
about
all
the
licensing
laws,
building
permit
laws,
that
sort
of
things.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
zoning
laws,
of
course.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
yes,
sir.
but
as
i
say
that'd
be
--
i
would
limit
the
application
of
the
argument
or
not
extend
it
to
situations
of
actual
privacy.
but
i'd
like
to
elaborate
a
little
more
on
the
statute
to
indicate
its
scope
and
indicate
the
extent
to
which
the
state
has
involved
itself
in
licensing
restaurants.
they
regulate
fire
escapes,
exits,
plumbing,
ventilation,
all
the
various
safety
precautions.
they
provide
that
no
employee
maybe
employed
unless
he
has
a
health
certificate.
the
regulations,
which
were
adopted
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
statute,
go
into
minute
detail
down
to
how
much
detergent
must
be
put
in
a
deep
sink
to
properly
cleanse
pots
and
pans,
so
much
for
safety
and
health.
but
the
statute
doesn't
seem
to
stop
there,
in
fact,
it
doesn't
stop
there.
statute
talks
about
the
welfare
of
the
people.
interestingly,
in
section
509.032
on
page
7
of
the
appendix
says,
"the
commissioner
shall
be
responsible
for
ascertaining
that
no
establishment
licensed
by
this
commission
shall
engage
in
any
misleading
advertising
or
unethical
practices,
as
defined
by
this
chapter
and
all
of
the
laws
now
enforced
to
which
may
hereafter
be
enacted.
similar
to
that
provision
is
another
provision
on
page
23
of
the
appendix
that
a
license
may
be
revoked
that
gambling
is
carried
on
from
the
premises.
in
addition,
the
regulations
provide
for
achievement
rating
cards,
which
are
to
be
posted
on
the
premises.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
it's
a
big
card
that
has
points
given
for
their
compliance
with
various
health
and
safety
provisions.
i
could
show
the
court
example
of
it.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
that
would
be
my
argument,
your
honor,
and
i
would
base
it
upon
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
let
me,
if
i
may,
go
back
to
the
case
of
public
utilities
commission
versus
pollak
and
that
was
the
case
of
the
radios
playing
in
the
buses
and
three
cars
here
in
district
of
columbia.
the
court,
in
the
first
part
of
its
opinion,
stated
that
the
capital
transit
system,
because
of
its
regulation
by
the
public
utilities
commission,
in
placing
these
radios
and
acting
in
the
way
it
did,
act
in
the
governmental
capacity,
and
that
first
amendment
rights
or
obligations
were
brought
in
to
play.
the
court
said
that
there
wasn't
a
mere
fact
that
there
was
a
franchise
granted.
the
court
stated
that
this
was
a
--
an
enterprise
regulated
by
a
state
agency.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
deemed
as
particular
significant
the
fact
that
the
transit
company
went
to
the
public
utilities
commission
to
get
a
ruling
on
this
particular
service,
the
radios.
here,
i
think,
if
we
had
gone
to
the
florida
hotel
commission
for
our
ruling,
we
would've
gotten
the
same
answer
necessarily
as
we've
got
from
the
florida
supreme
court,
namely
that
restaurant
owners
may
discriminate.
but
the
important
thing
about
the
pollak
case,
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
court
has
said
that
a
regulated
enterprise
where
it
acts
in
a
field
of
significant
public
importance,
public
transportation,
takes
on
characteristics
of
state
action,
for
there
is,
to
use
the
language
of
the
burton
case,
they
had
interdependence
between
the
state
and
the
--
the
private
enterprise.
a
similar
case
was
baldwin
against
morgan,
a
fifth
circuit
case
which
dealt
with
the
terminal
building
in
birmingham,
a
railroad
terminal
building.
and
that
fifth
circuit
made
the
same
kind
of
approach
that
here
was
a
public
--
here
was
a
facility
serving
a
public
need
regulated
by
the
city.
and
with
this
interdependence,
they
could
not
discriminate
against
negroes
in
the
seating
facilities.
i
would
suggest
that
if
capital
transit
company
or
some
other
public
street
railway
system
were
to
institute
(inaudible)
setup
on
its
streetcars
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
suggest
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
to
beat
the
monopoly
situation,
the
court
said
in
pollak
that
the
fact
it
had
a
franchise,
presumably
it
was
given
monopolistic
powers
was
unimportant.
but
even
if
the
court
should
consider
it
important,
then
it
would
seem
that
the
monopoly
situation
would
--
would
lead
to
an
absurd
result.
if
you
say
that
a
monopoly,
because
it's
a
monopoly,
cannot
discriminate
but
100
or
1500
restaurants,
because
they're
not
monopoly,
can
discriminate,
then
you
get
a
very
strange
result.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
but
where
the
need
is
there,
the
need
can
be
as
great
and
significant
to
the
negro
who
wants
to
eat
at
shell's
city
or
some
other
variety
store
or
department
store
as
the
need
for
an
equally
important
service
or
commodity
as
transportation.
i
don't
see
that
food
in
the
middle
of
a
day
when
you're
hungry
is
any
less
important
than
transportation,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
only
one
enterprise
that
provides
the
commodity,
should
in
my
mind,
will
make
the
constitutional
difference.
you
need
--
you
have
to
have
hundreds
of
restaurants
in
the
community.
one
transportation
system
can
serve
the
purpose.
that
is
essentially
the
argument
as
to
the
licensing
problem.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
they
are
--
they
are
already
regulated
in
a
--
in
a
great
sense.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i
think
it's
the
scope
of
the
regulation,
which
is
vast
here
in
this
case,
because
they
--
the
addition
to
what
i've
mentioned,
the
government
can
come
in.
it
has
visitation
powers.
it
can
inspect.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
they
can
but
i
suggest
that
what's
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
i
think
when
the
state
has
gone
this
far
and
indicated
this
much
of
a
concern
and
this
much
of
a
need
for
the
state
in
adopting
this
kind
of
a
--
a
comprehensive
licensing
statute
that
we
have
a
situation
which
is
analogues
to
the
burton
problem,
burton
versus
the
wilmington
parking
authority.
the
city
needed
that
restaurant
otherwise
its
parking
a
lot
financing
would
have
been
in
great
jeopardy.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
burton
versus
the
wilmington
parking
authority.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
the
property
was
owned
by
the
city.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
distinction.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
a
public
need
or
the
public
being
dependent
upon
this
particular
facility.
it
was
particular
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
no,
sir.
i
--
i
submit
that
the
two
can
be
related
that
the
court
talked
in
terms
of
the
extent,
the
nonobvious
ways
in
which
the
state
has
become
involved
in
the
private
enterprise
that
agreed
to
which
one
is
interdependent
upon
the
other,
a
kind
of
partnership
if
you
will.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
only
where
there
is
a
significant
community
interest
at
stake.
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
extend
the
rule,
extend
the
doctrine
to
private
situations.
i
think
the
court
can
deal
with
this
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
right.
at
that
point,
i
can
bring
up
marsh
versus
alabama
which
was
private
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
capital
transit
company
was
a
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
the
capital
transit
company
i
--
was,
i
assume,
a
private
enterprise,
yet
in
its
operation
in
this
particular
respect,
it
took
on
characteristics
of
a
governmental
activity.
the
court
went
to
great
pains
to
--
to
go
into
that.
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
my
argument
is
that
this
--
this
degree
of
--
of
interdependence,
you
use
the
word
as
--
mr.
alfred
i.
hopkins
that's
been
reached
here.
i
think
there's
a
matter
of
constitutional
adjudication
that
this
would
not
pose
an
impossible
job
for
the
court
in
drawing
lines.
and
the
classic
example
would
be
the
state
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
how
much
is
too
much?
when
does
the
burden
become
undue?
it's
a
difficult
paradoxical
problem
every
time
that
problem
arises,
but
the
court
needs
it
and
i
believe
the
court
can
read
it
in
this
kind
of
situation.
at
same
approach,
juridical
approach
in
the
field
of
public
accommodations.
with
regard
to
a
licensing
law,
i
think
it
should
be
applied
with
regard
to
the
shelley
and
kraemer
doctrine,
which
i
haven't
had
time
to
talk
about
here
this
morning,
but
i
adapt
the
same
views
as
my
colleagues
from
the
n.a.a.c.p.
that
we
don't
have
to
get
that
far
that
we
get
into
the
club
or
the
private
home.
that
we
deal
with
the
scope
of
the
indignity,
the
scope
of
the
indignity
and
the
humiliation
visited
upon
a
great,
massive
heart
of
our
public,
negro
citizen
and
--
indignity,
a
humiliation
which
is
visited
upon
them
everyday
in
every
community
in
they
sell,
in
hundreds
of
restaurants
and
in
hotels,
if
you
will.
i
think
it's
that
the
scope
of
the
problem
should
indicate
where
a
line
might
be
drawn
today.
in
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority,
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
a
problem
of
examining
the
facts
of
each
case
and
the
multitude
of
facts
that
existed
in
the
burton
case
led
to
a
conclusion
of
state
action.
i
suggest
that
the
multitude
of
involvement
of
the
state
and
of
the
restaurants
and
of
the
community
at
large
and
of
the
nation,
if
you
will,
require
a
finding
of
significant
state
action
in
this
case
substantial
enough
to
bring
the
action
within
the
proscription
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
don't
believe
that
hypothetical
situations
of
a
home
need
concerns.
thank
you.
