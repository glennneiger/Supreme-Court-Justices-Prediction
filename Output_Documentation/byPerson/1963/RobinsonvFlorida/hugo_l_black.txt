what
page
is

justice
hugo

black
what
--
what
is
the
precise
point
for
which
you
present
this
argument,
this
--
emphasize
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
mean
that
if
the
sentiment
of
a
community
can
only
be
met
by
taking
that
course
that
the
constitution
would
make
that
state
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
know
--
have
we
had
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
asking
you
this
for
information.
has
this
court
ever
had
a
case
when
it
gave
that
effect
to
custom
of
the
people
as
distinguished
from
custom
of
the
law
officers
and
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
long
continued
legal
practice
by
having
the
effects
such
as
we
had
in
the
tennessee
case
or
in
the
failing
to
summon
jurors
where
the
state
officials
just
did
not
do
it
over
the
period?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
relying
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
your
argument
here
except
insofar
as
you
want
to
construe
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
in
saying
that
custom
of
the
people
--
prevailing
sentiment
of
the
people
should
be
accepted
as
the
law
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
percentage
of
the
people
would
the
evidence
require
that
you
shall
have
that
custom
and
that
sentiment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
try
that
out?
have
you
used
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
that's
rather
slim
to
read,
isn't
it,
to
rest
constitutional
decision
on
as
to
whether
the
people
have
so
engrafted
it
on
a
--
as
a
part
of
their
legal
system
that
it
has
to
be
used
to
set
aside
the
state
law
as
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
he
wrote
to
that
effect
in
the
case
from
tennessee
with
reference
to
the
tax
rather
they
have
been
taxing
railroad,
as
i
--
i
hadn't
got
the
name
of
it,
but
that
was
in
line
with
our
cases
with
reference
to
juries
whether
the
court's
function
so
long
in
one
way
that
you
can
say
that
that
has
become
somewhat
say
the
custom
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
and
the
state
officials
and
others
might
say
just
the
custom
of
the
--
of
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
i
was
asking
you,
because
i'm
familiar
with
those
statements
and
i
think
you're
perfectly
right
in
presenting
it.
i
have
no
--
i
couldn't
understand
but
i'm
criticizing
you
about
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
base
still
on
diverging
the
regulation
of
a
business,
on
activity
by
the
state
to
be
treated
for
constitutional
purposes,
so
as
the
way
it
worked,
actual
state
operation
of
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
certain
regulations
with
reference
to
the
home.
any
of
those
that
you
mention
are
with
reference
to
the
home.
i
--
i
have
difficulty
in
distinguishing
constitutionally
speaking
between
one
private
--
one
ownership
by
a
person
and
another
ownership
by
a
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
boils
down,
as
i
understand
it,
to
this
that
since
restaurants
are
licensed
in
the
sense
that
people
need
to
buy
food
and
so
forth,
you
leave
them
to
private
ownership,
but
the
government
has
just
as
much
tried
to
regulate
them
as
it
would
have
if
the
government
were
exercising
governmental
authority,
as
some
nations
do,
to
own
all
the
property
and
decide
how
people
should
use
it
and
presume
they
are
the
associates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
they
are
regulated,
but
your
--
you
would
strike
down
the
distinction
as
i
understand
it
on
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
regulated
gives
the
government
the
right
to
do
these
other
things,
if
you
say,
when
it
wouldn't
have
if
they
were
not
regulated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
can
do
that
in
any
hotel
or
motel,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
man
was
living
in
it
--
many
people
live
in
hotels
and
motels
but
it's
just
as
thoroughly
regulated
as
the
other,
would
they
have
to
--
could
they
--
could
it
be
held
that
the
constitution,
i'm
not
talking
about
legislation,
could
it
be
held
that
the
constitution
itself
compels
them
to
accept
people
into
their
hotel
rooms
they
don't
want
or
for
whatever
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
owned
that
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
put
it
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
of
the
differences
seems
to
me
to
be
greater
than
the
one
as
we
have
adopted
in
this
nation.
rightly
or
wrongly,
some
people
think
one
and
some
another
most
think
likely
consistent
with
private
ownership
of
property
and
wouldn't
--
you
--
you
would
obliterate
that
where
the
government
regulates
it
at
all,
would
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
refer
to
private,
you
always
ignore
the
private,
what
we
call,
the
private
ownership
is
ownership
by
somebody
other
than
the
government.
that's
what
it
meant
by
private
system,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
marsh
versus
alabama
has
many
other
phase
and
connections
and
your
situation
does
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
refer
to
it
if
you
still
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
the
government
could
go
so
far
when
it
would
be
a
governmental
activity,
where
despite
terms
and
contracts
and
paper
writing,
the
government
was
actually
doing
it
and
purported
to
put
it
in
somebody
else's
hand.
i
agree
with
that.
is
that
the
argument
you're
making
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
been
reached
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
a
contract
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
a
contract
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
your
court
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
the
court
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
enter
into
discussion
at
any
stage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
defense
argued
yesterday
that
this
did
violate
the
rules
of
--
did
violate
their
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
that
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
store,
stay
there
whether
they
wanted
to
go
or
stay
or
not
in
orders
that
they
might
advocate
their
views
about
their
opposition
to
segregation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
argument
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
the
right
to
go
to
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
the
right
--
that
gets
down
to
this
question.
do
you
have
the
right
to
speak
under
the
first
amendment,
do
you
also
have
the
right
to
go
to
a
place
where
there's
a
valid
law,
assuming
its
valid,
but
you
can't
go
to
interfere
with
somebody
else
to
exercising
the
right
of
free
speech?
do
you
have
the
right
to
go
(inaudible)
or
you
must
do
it
somewhere
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
no
right
to
be
at
a
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
first
amendment
guarantees
that
people
shall
go
to
places
where,
under
the
law,
they
could
not
otherwise
go
on
the
ground
that
they've
got
to
be
allowed
to
advocate
their
views,
wherever
they
please,
whenever
they
please,
and
however
they
please?
