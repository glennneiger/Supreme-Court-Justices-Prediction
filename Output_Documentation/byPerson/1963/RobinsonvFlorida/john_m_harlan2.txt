but
then
we
have
to
take
the
statute,
the
construction
of
the
statute's
meaning
that
your
court,
the
florida
court
and
not
a
state
law,
has
said
that
this
statute
means
that
an
owner
can
exclude
somebody
for
any
reason
that
he
wants
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
we're
bound
by
that
construction,
aren't
we?
