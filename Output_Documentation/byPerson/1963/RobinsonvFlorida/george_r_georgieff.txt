mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
by
the
time
this
day
is
over,
you
will
have
had
quite
enough
of
these
cases
being
so
similar,
so
i'll
be
very
limited
in
my
reply.
first,
i'd
like
to
clear
away
several
things.
basically,
i
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
action
that
you
are
about
to
review
here,
with
several
exceptions.
first,
you'll
find
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
shell's
city
restaurant
was
licensed
by
any
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
florida.
there's
not
a
trace
of
it
anywhere.
you
will
also
find
that
sergeant's
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
but
we
are
not
free
to
assume
that
it
was,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
agree
that
that
would
be
a
logical
presumption
but
in
any
case,
we
are
confronted
with
the
records
that
we
have
here.
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
establish
that
they
were
or
weren't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
a
fact
therein
the
case
just
as
are
the
situations
brought
up
by
counsel
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
can't
say
that
since
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
will
say
this.
i
assume
that
they
were
and
if
they
do
apply
and
i'm
sure
they
do,
chances
are
shell's
city
was
a
licensed
establishment.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
assume
it
was,
sir.
sergeant
suggs,
when
he
went
around
the
tables
with
mr.
mckelvey
and
mr.
williams,
both
are
whom
were
vice
presidents
and
one
a
manager
of
the
restaurant,
after
these
people
were
asked
to
leave
by
mr.
mckelvey
at
each
table,
sergeant
suggs
asked
them
or
suggested
that
they
should
leave
before
anything
else
follow.
when
they
declined,
it
was
then
that
he
arrested
them
for
the
commission
of
this
act
that
resulted
in
the
criminal
action
being
brought
against
them.
so
in
that
respect,
it's
somewhat
similar
to
the
case
that
you
heard
yesterday
in
which
the
police
declined
to
do
anything
and
required
the
individual
to
go
down
and
make
his
complaint
before
the
magistrate's
court.
now,
there
has
been
a
question
raised
here
about
whether
customs
of
a
community
should
form
the
basis
for
your
conclusion
that
this
amounts
to
a
state
action
here.
and
if
it
does,
you
should
then
turnaround
and
condemn
what's
happened
in
florida
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
that
there's
a
fair
reason
why
you
can't
equate
customs
to
state
action
in
this
case.
you
can
impose
your
sanctions
against
the
people
of
dade
county
if
they
feel
that
they
preferred
generally
not
to
associate
in
restaurants
with
a
negro,
the
white
people
that
is.
now,
i
do
not,
for
one
moment,
suggest
that
either
mr.
mckelvey
or
mr.
williams,
whoever
it
happened
to
be,
are
free
to
determine
for
this
court
what
the
general
belief,
feeling,
or
custom
is
in
dade
county.
there
are
over
a
million
people
in
metropolitan
dade
county
right
now.
i
hesitate
to
think
that
mr.
williams
is
qualified
to
pass
on
this.
but
even
if
he
is,
you
could
only
impose
sanctions
based
upon
this
custom
if
the
government
of
dade
county
or
florida
or
the
city
of
miami
were
to
abdicate
any
duty
that
it
had
under
your
constitution
and
our
own
for
that
matter
based
upon
this
custom.
if
they
had
found,
because
of
what
people
believe
or
thought
that
they
wouldn't
dare
to
turnaround
and
arrest
anybody
for
failing
to
serve
a
negro,
and
if
that
became
their
policy,
then
i
would
expect
that
you
would
strike
it
down,
based
upon
the
custom
as
developed
by
the
acts
or
failure
of
the
act
of
the
law
enforcement
or
the
government
of
the
state.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it's
a
little
different.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
--
i'm
on
tenterhooks
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
goldberg.
you
see,
when
you
add
the
affirmative
mention
of
a
class
of
people
or
a
creed,
take
your
pick,
it
doesn't
matter,
then
you
begin
to
evidence
by
your
legislative
act,
some
opinion,
some
official
opinion
to
which
you
can
direct
a
complaint.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
more
nearly
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
more
nearly
invalid
than
valid,
if
you
make
that
mention.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir.
what
was
your
question
with
that
illustration?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
is
not
in
my
view,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'll
tell
you
why,
sir.
if
we
do
away
with
509.141
and
wipe
it
off
the
books,
you're
nevertheless
confronted
either
with
common
law
trespass
or
the
statute
that
we
have
which
is
i
think
832.01
or
823,
i'm
not
certain
which.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir.
now,
in
those
cases,
an
owner
of
private
property
exercises
whatever
he
pleases
as
his
reason
to
evict
someone
from
his
premises.
if
you
leave
it
to
him
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
no,
sir.
i'll
tell
you
why
indictments
invariably
are
returned
only
in
capital
cases
in
florida.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
said
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir.
now,
assuming
that
that
is
so
and
it
is,
if
you
allow
a
man
who
has
a
farm,
a
home,
take
your
pick,
whatever
it
is,
he
has
some
private
property.
if
you
allow
him
to
determine
who
he
shall
have
on
his
premises
and
if
he
shall
have
him
and
for
how
long
and
for
any
reason,
then
does
it
matter
that
you
take
a
section
and
create
it
and
you
codify
that,
which
you
already
have
extended
him
as,
let's
say,
your
majesty
of
the
law,
so
that
he
doesn't
have
to
take
it
into
his
own
hands,
i
fail
to
see
any
difference.
i
--
i
agree
that
depending
upon
how
you
approach
it.
if
you
go
backwards
from
your
illustrations,
you
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
since
custom
is
the
basis
for
as
you'd
reach
that
but
basically,
we
go
forward
from
poor
beginnings
to
more
sophisticated
ones.
and
if
we
say
to
the
people
who
own
business
establishments,
if
you
feel
--
and
who
is
better
qualified
knowing
his
clientele
that
the
continued
presence
of
someone
here
is
going
to
be
offensive
to
your
business
and
will
prove
detrimental,
and
you
allow
to
an
ordinary
citizen
in
his
home,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
two.
it's
one
that
you
extend
as
a
matter
of
right
and
law
for
many
years,
centuries
perhaps,
and
now
one
that
you
simply
draw
forth
in
specific
terms
in
relation
to
business
establishments.
i
don't
know
sir
that
that
answers
your
question
but
i
hope
it
does.
now,
i'd
like
to
advert
to
marsh
versus
alabama.
that
seems
to
be
one
in
which
there
was
almost
to
complete
abdication,
the
people
were
denied
the
right
to
voice
their
expressions
as
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
philosophy
of
this
court
was
when
you
said
what
you
did
in
marsh.
but
i
imagine
that
part
of
it
might
have
been
a
real
fear
that
if
you
didn't
reverse
marsh,
that
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
the
states
to
turn
overall
their
communities
to
private
individuals
to
sell
them
and
they
would
rule
them
as
they
like,
like
company
towns.
now,
if
that
is
real,
it
might
be
a
reason
i
don't
know.
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
shelley
as
the
basis
for
the
request
on
the
part
of
these
appellants
that
you
should
implement
what
you
did
there
in
this
case.
now,
there's
been
so
much
written
about
shelley
versus
kraemer
that
i
suppose
that
one
can
speak
of
it,
but
many
case,
i
know
the
one
thing
that
you
did
not
say
about
shelley.
you
did
not
say
that
the
person
who
sold
to
shelley
had
to
sell
to
him.
all
you
did
say
was
once
shelley
earned
the
lawful
right
to
title
to
that
property,
it
was
not
proper,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
for
the
state
of
missouri
to
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
that
property.
now,
he
had
earned
it
by
a
free
sale,
by
the
party
who
had
owned
it,
and
he
merely
sought
to
enjoy
that
right.
if
these
people
who
came
into
shell's
city's
restaurant
had
been
successful
in
securing
services
from
the
management
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
had
nothing,
sir.
now,
had
they
been
able
to
secure
services
from
him
in
exchange
for
their
money,
you
would
have
the
situation
that
you
do
in
kraemer.
if
he
sold
them
the
food
and
then
said,
"well,
now,
look,
wait
a
minute,
you
can't
eat
this
food
in
here.
take
it
out,
but
you
can't
eat
it
in
here
because
we
don't
allow
that
based
upon
custom."
then
you'd
have
the
comparable
situation
that's
reflected
in
shelley.
but
you
don't
have
that
here.
all
you
have
is
somebody
who
says,
"i
want
a
guarantee
not
only
that
i
can
contract
but
that
when
i
do,
it
will
be
as
i
wish
it
to
be."
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir,
if
something
occurs.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
if
he
puts
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
sir,
i'm
at
a
loss
now.
we
don't
have
any
decision
which
explains
this
statute.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
there
are
some
who
say
it
would.
i
--
i'm
not
certain
that
it
would.
i
assume
that
the
most
i
could
say
in
honesty,
not
departing
from
my
position
or
doing
harm
to
those
who
did
--
to
that
and
the
appellants
is
that
if
he
were
to
put
the
people
back
in
the
position
that
they
were
before
they
came
in,
that
is
to
say
gave
them
back
their
money
and
there
were
a
genuine
basis
upon
which
he
could
conclude
that
there
were
detrimental,
i'd
take
it
that
that
is
possible
under
the
statute.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
should
assume
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
not
our
defense.
it
was
never
raised
to
a
point
that
was
raised
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
what
would
i
think?
you
would
have
to
demonstrate,
i
suppose.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
dare
say
that
by
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
the
very
statute,
assuming
that
it's
correctly
quoted
here,
i
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
it
isn't,
if
the
--
if
you
leave
it
to
management,
as
you
do
in
ordinary
cases
of
trespass,
there
is
no
way.
how
do
you
explain
to
somebody
who
does
not
want
you
in
his
home
that
you
belong
there?
you
don't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
right.
and
based
upon
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
we
do
that
everyday
in
an
ordinary
trespass,
sir.
that
results
in
criminal
action.
it
doesn't
always
but
it
may.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
is
that
not
the
basis
of
the
private
owners
order
to
get
out.
his
own
opinion
that
he
doesn't
want
him
there.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
mean
to
question,
your
honor,
don't
misunderstand,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
can
separate
the
two.
isn't
it
opinion
that
generates
an
order
to
leave
however
arbitrary?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
of
course,
it
is.
no
question
about
it
and
it
is
in
823
as
well.
you
become
a
trespasser
after
the
notice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
as
opposed
to
one
who
simply
enters
on
a
property.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
perhaps
it
is,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
say,
putting
these
two
side-by-side,
you
simply
have
an
open
legislative
announcement
as
to
one
where
there
is
to
the
other,
it's
been
something
that's
developed
over
the
years.
now,
if
i,
both
as
the
private
homeowner
and
as
a
restaurant
operator,
decide
as
to
the
same
person,
one,
that
i
don't
want
him
in
my
house
once
he's
in
there,
and
i'll
tell
him
to
leave,
and
that
i
no
longer
want
him
in
my
restaurant
and
i
tell
him
to
leave,
i
fail
to
see
the
difference.
now,
if
there
is,
perhaps,
i
can
go
further
toward
answering
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
just
don't
see
that
there
is
any
difference.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
didn't
read
it
all.
they
simply
said
that
on
its
face,
it
was
valid.
they
didn't
enter
into
that
area.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
now
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
did,
sir.
in
as
much
as
there
was
no
question
as
to
evidence,
they
stated,
and
i
think
you'll
find
in
their
opinion
that's
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
that
since
the
only
point
raised
was
the
validity
of
509.141
that
they
concluded
that
on
its
face,
it
was
totally
color
blind
and
perforce
constitutional.
now,
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
went
into
their
deliberations
but
they
did
not
discuss
the
matters
that
are
brought
up
here.
now,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'd
like
to
think
you
were.
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
is
by
nature
--
by
the
nature
of
the
property
that
the
statute
breaks
down
into
four
sections.
and
in
the
fourth,
when
you
get
to
the
section
which
says,
"and
any
other
person".
now,
i
would
assume
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
wherever
you
might
be
that
these
enumerated
areas
or
acts
or
situations
would
probably
provide
a
valid
basis
for
anybody
to
act
in
defense
of
themselves,
their
property,
etcetera.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
other,
the
area
where
it's
left
to
the
individual,
it
is
because
it
is
private
property
that
they
have
to
extend
in
some
latitude
if
the
only
reasons
you
could
were
for
those
enumerated,
while
there
wouldn't
be
enough
paper
in
the
world
to
write
out
all
the
reasons.
you
have
got
to
leave
something
to
an
individual
as
you
do
in
ordinary
trespass,
as
you
do
in
the
--
in
other
situations.
if
you
do
not,
then
you
wind
up
in
a
hopeless
mirage.
you
either
--
you
either
enumerate
beyond
belief
or
you
leave
it
totally
without
mention.
now,
i
don't
pretend
to
know
why
they
bothered
to
say
it
the
way
they
did
in
the
legislature,
but
i
assume
that
they
had
a
valid
reason.
and
so
far,
of
course,
it
hasn't
been
changed
except
by
an
insubstantial
alteration
by
the
'61
legislature.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
don't
allow
some
latitude
for
an
individual
to
determine
what,
in
his
view,
is
going
to
be
detrimental,
even
if
it'd
be
this,
however
vague
you
may
consider
it
to
be,
then
there
isn't
anything
that
you
can
give
him.
if
he
isn't
drunk,
if
he
isn't
brawling,
if
he
isn't
offensive
or
abusive,
then
theoretically,
you
can't
put
him
out
even
if
you
are
offended
by
it
and
even
if
you
do
know
that
it
will
be
detrimental.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
understand
that
there
are
parts
of
it
which
are
quite
broad.
i
don't
know
how
much
--
how
specific
we
could
be
and
still
have
anything
that
is
workable.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir,
and
then
only
on
its
face.
there
has
been
no
construction
of
it
as
such.
i
might
add
though
that
these
individuals,
whatever
we
may
personally
think
about
the
conduct
that
resulted.
one
thing
they
knew
for
certain,
they
were
neither
of
the
enumerated
things
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
the
fact
is
that
they
went
there
planning
to
do
this
very
thing
which
is
apart
from
what
we're
discussing
here.
but
now
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
state
action.
there
has
been
the
hue
and
cry
raised
that
they
were
informed
against
by
the
office
of
the
state
attorney,
that
they
were
sentenced
by
a
judge
of
the
criminal
court
of
record,
that
the
district
court
of
appeal
acted
on
it,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
acted
on
it,
and
that
the
attorney
general
is
now
a
part
of
it.
well,
by
law,
we're
required
to
be.
any
criminal
action
in
the
state
of
florida
as
is
probably
true
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions
including
the
district
of
columbia
are
brought
by
some
prosecuting
arm
of
the
executive
branch.
i
fail
to
see
how
this
type
of
action
makes
it
state
action.
i
further
fail
to
see
how
sergeant
suggs,
when
he
arrested
after
a
refusal
to
leave
in
the
face
of
this
legislation,
was
doing
anything
but
what
he
was
required
to
do
as
a
part
of
his
duties
as
a
law
enforcement
official.
now,
if
he
is
given
the
ability,
the
duty,
the
responsibility,
the
choice
to
decide
whether
a
given
act
is
or
isn't,
then
we
don't
need
this
court
or
any
other
court,
because
if
our
police
officers
can
decide
what
is
a
crime,
then
we
don't
need
any
courts.
and
before
too
much
longer,
if
they
become
proficient
at
it,
we
won't
need
laws.
but
the
point
is,
the
legislation
as
it
exists,
at
least
until
you
have
had
a
chance
to
review
it
and
pass
upon
it,
is
valid.
and
we've
got
to
presume
that
if
you
refuse
to
leave
after
you've
been
asked,
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
and
this
was
in
the
presence
of
the
police
officer
who
asked
them
and
even
suggested
that
they
leave
before
he
arrested
them,
then
have
committed
those
acts
which,
if
they
result
in
a
conviction,
constitute
the
misdemeanor
of
which
they
ultimately
were
found
guilty
by
the
trier
of
fact.
now,
custom
is
one
thing,
police
action
is
another.
any
crime
that
is
committed
results
in
some
type
of
prosecution,
i
would
hope.
now,
admittedly,
there
are
times
when
choices
are
made
as
to
which
way
to
go
but
that
is
not
done
by
a
law
enforcement,
that's
done
by
a
prosecution
and/or
the
court
which
is
the
proper
place
for
it
to
repose.
but
it's
idle
to
say
that
because
all
of
these
circumstances
which
led
to
the
case
finding
its
way
here,
that
becomes
state
action.
the
state
did
not
advocate
anything.
they
have
a
statute
which
simply
says
that
these
people
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
exercise
the
right
over
their
property.
and
therefore,
anybody
who
flies
into
the
face
of
this
request,
after
it's
been
made
in
accordance
therewith,
is
guilty
if
the
--
if
it
results
in
the
trial
in
the
finding
of
guilt.
now,
there
was
a
reluctance
yesterday
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
enter
into
the
question
of
whether
this
approaches
religion,
i
am
not
so
reluctant,
i
don't
seen
how
you
can
avoid
it.
let
us
assume,
if
you
will,
that
in
a
given
ceremony
in
a
jewish
synagogue,
you
have
four
catholics
come
in
carrying
crucifixes,
who
sit
themselves
in
the
front
row.
this
is
an
open
and
public
indicia
of
a
difference
of
creed,
which
is
offensive
to
the
jewish
populace
and
to
the
rabbi.
what
can
he
do?
well,
i
suppose
he
could
ask
them
to
leave,
but
if
they
decline,
what
could
he
do?
could
he
force
them
to
leave?
ask
them
or
rather
force
them
to
get
out?
could
he
call
the
police?
i
think
he
should
be
free
to.
now,
the
difference
between
creed
and
color
means
absolutely
nothing
if
you
look
at
the
constitution
that
assures
that
they
are
guarantees.
and
yet,
here,
we
don't
have
anything
different,
not
in
the
slightest.
if
you
say
to
me
that
these
people
cannot
be
discriminated
against
by
private
citizens
who
hold
themselves
out
to
serve
the
public,
i
say
to
you
that
there
isn't
any
reason
why
the
rabbi
should
be
permitted
to
call
upon
law
enforcement.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
that
is
true,
sir.
well,
it
isn't
all
as
i
would
have
it,
if
you
understand.
i
--
i
realize
that.
and
yet,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
get
to
the
area
of
the
differences
between
creed,
condition
of
servitude,
color,
and
so
on,
i
can't
bring
myself
to
believe
that
we
can
effectively
separate
it
when
it
suits
us
and
bind
it
when
it
doesn't.
now,
let's
take
the
situation
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
they
have
that
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
was
out
for
some
time.
it's
possible
i
missed
it,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
that
they
do
have
that
right.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
you've
said
that
many
times
over.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
sir,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
you
have
--
they
have
the
right
to
go
into
the
shell's
city's
restaurant
but
once
they
were
--
once
the
management
determined
that
they
no
longer
wanted
them
in
there,
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
remain.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
not
in
my
view,
sir.
to
the
licensing
provisions
that
i
might
add,
which
i
didn't
mean
to
implement
by
saying
that
they
weren't
--
there
wasn't
any
evidence
that
there
was
a
license
in
this
case.
but
i
have
set
out
in
my
brief
the
fact
that
automobiles
are
probably
the
most
licensed
thing
in
the
state
and
probably,
in
most
states.
now,
i'd
like
someone
to
tell
me
why
it
becomes
different
when
you
apply
it
to
an
automobile
if
you're
going
to
use
that
as
the
criteria.
now,
again,
like
i
say,
we
can't
separate
it
when
it
suits
us
for
our
argument
and
then
bind
it
together
when
it
doesn't.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
licensing
requirements
form
a
satisfactory
basis
on
which
you
should
conclude
that
there
is
sufficient
state
control
to
make
it
state
action,
then
i
submit
that
every
car
that's
driven
in
the
state
of
florida
drives
as
a
result
of
state
action.
every
home
that's
occupied
by
anybody
--
we've
got
a
homestead
exemption
law
that
says
that
if
i
become
a
literal
popper,
they
fall
on
every
depth,
that
they
could
do
everything
they'd
like
to
me
but
they
can't
take
my
home
from
me.
now,
that's
a
recognition
by
the
state
that
they're
going
to
ensure
my
castle
to
me.
now,
if
they
go
that
far,
which
is
even
further
than
what
they've
don
here
by
a
longshot,
does
it
not
follow
that
they
have
a
right
to
tell
me
who
and
who
i
shall
not
have
in
my
home
or
that
anybody
may
come
in
and
it
suits
his
fancy.
now,
i'll
agree
and
there's
a
similarity.
i
think
we'll
all
agree
that
someone
has
a
right
to
come
to
my
door
and
ask
of
me
what
he
will.
i
may
either
reply
or
tell
him
to
go
on
about
his
business
just
as
in
shell's
city
here.
they
came
upon
the
premises,
sought
to
do
business
with
these
people,
they
were
declined
the
right
to
do
so
and
they
were
asked
to
leave.
not
at
all
different
from
what
i
might
do
in
my
home
or
you
or
anybody
else.
now,
if
we
extend
that
on
the
theory
of
the
licensing
requirements,
then
i
submit
that
there
is
no
end
to
it.
you
can
go
on
at
infinity.
now,
i
don't
pose
a
threat
to
you,
that's
foolish,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
these
things
are
going
to
happen
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
any
day
after
that.
but
if
you're
going
to
put
it
within
the
legal
framework
that
they
say
you
should
use
as
one
of
the
basis
then
i
say,
don't
separate
it
as
to
the
others
which
you
know
will
be
there
one
day.
i
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
were
not
told
why
but
the
statute
contemplates
that
they
needn't
to
be
told
why.
it
wholly
requires
that
if
management
had
the
opinion,
that's
all
that's
necessary.
now,
i
hasten
to
add,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
--
the
point
raised
by
brief
of
amicus
is
one
which
is
totally
foreign
to
this
case.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
was
reserving
some
time,
but
if
--
if
you
like
i
can
add
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
but
based
upon
the
positions
which
has
been
presented
by
counsel
for
the
appellants
here
and
the
total
nonapplicability
of
shelley
and
certainly
not
even
(inaudible)
which
gives
the
people
the
right
to
contract
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
you're
ready
to
determine
that
an
ordinary
citizen
in
the
pursuit
of
his
rights
--
now,
he
doesn't
have
property
rights,
he
has
personal
rights
to
handle
his
property
the
way
it
suits
him,
unless
you're
ready
to
determine,
and
determine
that
these
rights
shall
no
longer
be
his
own,
and
unless
you
are
ready
to
upset
the
civil
rights
cases,
i
think
that
your
only
result
can
be
that
you
affirm
the
action
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
deny
this
appeal.
