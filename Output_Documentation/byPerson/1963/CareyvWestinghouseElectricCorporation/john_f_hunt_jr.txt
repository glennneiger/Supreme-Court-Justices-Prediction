mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
represent
the
party
who
has
put
at
his
payroll
by
the
uncertainties
in
this
situation.
well,
the
facts
here
are
not
in
dispute.
there
are
few
facts
with
which
i
would
like
to
profess
what
i
have
to
say.
we
did
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
person
in
the
analogy
mr.
cox
made
sell
our
house
to
two
people.
we
have
a
contract
with
iue
which
incorporates
by
reference
the
board
certification
and
purports
to
do
so.
we
agree
to
recognize
them
for
those
units
for
which
they
have
lawfully
been
certified
by
the
board
pursuant
to
an
election.
the
board
determine
unit
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
agreement
at
the
baltimore
works,
specifically
exclude
all
salary
technical
workers.
we
bargained
with
the
federation
also
on
the
basis
of
--
of
a
certification
and
a
board
determine-unit
and
an
identical
recognition
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
no.
the
federation
unit
excludes
specifically
all
production
and
maintenance
works,
so
we
did
not
consciously
sell
our
house
to
two
people.
we
quite
meticulously
kept
these
jurisdictional
problems
straight
by
insisting
on
board
certifications
as
a
matter
of
company
policy
and
by
limiting
recognition
obligations
to
board
certifications
and
to
the
board
determine
units.
now,
the
electrical
industry
is
quite
unlike
in
most
other
major
industries
organized
by
the
cio.
the
steel
industry
is
entirely
organized
by
the
steel
workers.
electrical
industry,
there
is
a
very
terrible
fragmentation.
there
is
the
iue,
there
is
the
old
ue,
there
is
the
ibew,
there
is
an
iam
and
etcetera
and
--
and
--
ad
hoc
unions
such
as
the
federation
which
is
quite
a
substantial
union,
but
not
affiliated.
the
second
factual
point
which
i
would
like
to
make
by
way
of
propose
is
that
this
--
whether
this
is
truly
the
kind
of
minor
fringe
group
which
the
board
should
not
have
to
be
bothered
that
one
of
employee
does
he
belong
here
or
there,
is
not
certain
in
this
case.
but
the
union
itself
alleged
in
its
affidavit
below
in
a
sort
of
backhanded
way
that
what
we've
done
is
take
half
of
the
production
and
maintenance
unit
and
put
it
into
this
laboratory.
now,
that
unit
is
about
500
people
so
there
are
250
people
here
involved.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
that
is
in
the
category
of
the
minors
fringe
group
that
the
board
shouldn't
have
to
bother
with.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
submission
in
a
sense
by
saying
what
we
don't
disagree
with.
the
court
below
unquestionably
had
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
and
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy
because
the
subject
matter
is
an
alleged
breach
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
that
subject
matter
was
clear
--
clearly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
using
the
word
jurisdiction
in
its
technical
census
applied
to
courts.
we
also
agree
that
the
fact
that
a
cut
controversy
is
cognizable
by
the
board
under
the
act
and
by
the
courts
under
301
does
not
preclude
that
--
that
does
not
militate
against
the
courts
having
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
the
word
which
we
first
used
it
over
the
same
controversy.
that
is
if
you
--
if
you
bargain
to
comply
with
your
statutory
duty
and
thereby,
give
rise
in
the
union
both
to
a
statutory
and
a
contract
right,
that
contract
right
at
least
subject
to
the
special
circumstances,
which
i
think
exist
in
this
case,
can
be
enforce
under
--
under
301.
now,
justice
white
referred
to
the
similarity
between
this
case
and
smith-the
evening
news.
the
concurrency
of
jurisdiction
as
between
the
board
and
the
courts
represented
by
smith-the
evening
news
is
a
currency
as
to
a
claim
that
an
employer
has
discriminated
against
an
employee
because
of
his
union
affiliations
or
associations.
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
under
883
which
is
also
brought
under
a
contract
and
contracts
typically
agree
not
to
discriminate
by
reason
of
union
membership.
now,
the
decision
of
the
court
in
smith,
might
--
might
employ
a
different
expertise
on
the
decision
of
the
board
if
the
action
were
brought
on
unfair
labor
practice
complaint.
the
--
the
conclusion
of
the
court
might
not
find
the
board
and
vice
versa
in
this
situation
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
but
if
the
court
awarded
back
pay
to
smith,
the
board
would
certainly
offset
it
against
any
back
pay
award
it
might
enter
under
section
8
of
the
act
and
vice
versa
again
as
--
if
the
board
acts
first
in
the
case.
an
employer
can
be
exonerated
by
the
board
under
the
statutory
criteria
and
found
liable
by
the
court
under
the
contract
criteria
or
vice
versa.
now,
this
may
create
anomaly
but
it
is
not
a
disruptive
factor
in
industrial
relation
nor
does
that
it
put
the
employer
in
impossible
position.
all
that's
involved
is
money
and
the
inconvenience
of
being
forced
to
litigate
the
same
underlying
subject
matter
twice.
but
it
was
noted
in
smith
that
at
serious
problems
arose
of
--
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
under
301
should
not
be
considered
foreclosed
by
the
judgment
in
smith
and
that's
what's
involved
here.
it
was
--
did
the
fourth
court
below
properly
decline
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
under
301?
so
far
as
remarks
were
made
about
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
reference
to
interlake
iron,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
interlake
had
just
been
decided
at
--
in
the
inter-row
between
the
argument
and
the
writing
of
the
opinion
and
they
picked
up
the
language
from
interlake.
the
opinion
below
which
expresses
the
rationale
we
asserted
is
the
appellate
division's
opinion
which
is
not
relying
on
dogmatic
preemptions.
it's
relying
on
the
orderly
procedures
contemplated
by
the
act.
now,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
--
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
in
the
sense
of
a
complaint
of
antiunion
discrimination
is
--
is
very
considerable
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
smith
type
situation.
you're
dealing
with
allegations
of
employer
misconduct.
you're
dealing
with
the
propriety
of
past
conduct
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
in
respect
of
this
period
in
which
a
fellow
of
smith
wasn't
paid
and
other
people
were
paid.
once
you
resolved
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
as
to
that
past
conduct,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
court
resolved
it
or
the
board
resolved
it.
the
controversy
has
been
put
to
--
to
rest.
now,
when
the
concurrency
is
between
a
question
of
the
scope
of
a
board
determine
unit
and
the
breach
of
a
recognition
obligation
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
incorporates
by
reference
that
board
determine
unit,
when
the
frost
of
the
grievance
is
to
seek
an
enlargement
of
representational
jurisdiction,
the
situation
has
entirely
different
because
the
adjudication
is
not
going
to
be
an
adjudication
of
who
was
right
and
who
was
wrong
in
the
past
in
any
real
sense,
it's
an
adjudication
of
status
who
is
entitled
to
represent
these
people.
and
the
adjudication
of
status
has
continuing
effect
in
the
industrial
relations
involved.
it
affects
all
rights
and
obligations
in
respect
of
iue,
all
rights
and
obligations
in
respect
to
federation,
all
rights
and
obligations
in
respect
to
the
employees.
the
employees'
rights
and
obligations
in
respect
of
ourselves,
in
respect
to
the
union
involved.it
even
affects
third-party
unions
not
yet
heard
from.
if
the
arbitrator
improperly
includes
this
group
in
the
iue
unit
under
section
9
stand
and
we
fail
to
deal
with
federation
in
respect
to
this
group
and
deal
with
the
iue
respectively,
we
think
that
fringe
group
is
up
for
grabs
by
any
other
union.
that
might
is
--
is
not
protected,
we
are
not
protected
by
8(d)
(4)
(d)
under
those
circumstances.
so
when
status
adjudications
are
involved,
we
think
that
serious
problems
do
involve
--
do
arise.
now,
the
fact
that
are
problems,
it
doesn't
mean
that
that
we
carry
the
vague
here.
it
does
mean
that
the
--
the
problems
required
that
the
purposes,
policies
and
structure
of
the
entire
scheme
of
the
act
be
taken
into
account
in
construing
and
applying
section
301
here.
now,
section
301
is
not
an
independent
categorical
imperative
in
the
act.
it
embodies
a
policy
favoring
arbitration,
but
it
is
not
the
only
policy
in
the
act.
there
are
many
coordinate
policies
in
the
act.
and
i
take
it
--
mr.
cox
agrees
those
policies
maybe
relevantly
discuss
here.
we
disagree
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
to
--
to
the
balancing
of
advantage
and
disadvantage
in
this
case,
but
they
are
properly
before
the
court.
and
one
of
the
main
charges
put
against
us
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
speculative
possibilities
and
speculative
problems,
and
speculative
injury.
in
other
words
speculative
is
used
as
an
epithet
there.
we
cannot
guarantee
that
anyone
of
the
many,
many
undesirable
consequences
that
couldn't
secure
actually
will
ensue.
the
question
isn't
whether
any
or
all
of
them
or
each
of
them
is
inevitable
if
this
goes
to
arbitration.
the
question
is
what
is
reasonably
foreseeable
as
a
practical
matter?
are
we
to
be
put
out
our
peril
because
the
harm
we
talk
about,
respective
harm
we
talk
about
is
not
inevitable?
we
should
not
be
put
at
our
peril
for
having
done
everything
the
act
seems
to
have
required
of
us.
we
bargain
with
unions
that
represent
our
employees.
we
recognize
them
and
agree
to
recognize
them
for
the
units
for
which
the
board
determined.
we
carefully
eliminate
--
limited
our
contract
obligations.
and
why
should
we
--
what
--
what
--
where
do
you
distill
the
peril
that
we're
supposed
to
be
exposed
to
here?
you
can't
distill
it
from
any
other
section
of
the
act
and
i
don't
think
you
can
distill
from
section
301.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
yes
sir
we
--
we
--
we
might
and
our
answer
to
that
is
that
we
are
satisfied
with
the
status
quo
that
does
not
indicate
a
lack
of
neutrality.
we
are
satisfied
with
the
status
quo.
we
think
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
the
status
quo,
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
us
to
go
before
the
board
to
clarify
these
unions.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
that's
right.
that
the
union
wants
to
seek
us
to
change
the
status
quo,
they
bring
arbitration
against
us.
we
could
run
right
around
to
the
board
the
minute
they
brought
this
suit
and
i
don't
think
we'd
be
her
today
if
we
did.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
hope
--
i
hope
it
would
not
and
--
and
the
extent
which
of
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
no,
no
and
--
and
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
well,
our
posture
before
the
board
would
be
something
different
than
disagreeing
with
the
arbitrator's
award.
our
posture
before
the
board
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
as
a
stakeholder
of
these
jobs
or
this
place
as
to
where
the
board
would
have
to
decide
what
did
we
mean
in
1955
when
we
entered
this
union
--
union
order?
as
the
situation
changed
in
respect
to
gap
classification,
in
respect
to
proximity
of
facilities,
how
many
people
are
involved?
are
there
so
many
people
that
we
should
merely
clarify
the
mineral
of
anybody's
unit,
but
we
should
hold
an
election
perhaps
the
self-determination
like,
perhaps
in
this
case
has
--
as
--
as
recently
occurred
at
a
--
another
form
more
location
in
--
another
resting
house
location
in
baltimore.
the
fringe
group
constituted
so
many
people
that
the
board
said,
“we
create
a
third
unit
here
from
either
units
has
a
trade
in
circumstances,
a
third
unit,
self-determination
for
that
unit.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
why
we
should
we
have
that
obligation?
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
believe
that
so
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
your
honor
that
same
question
could've
been
asked
with
mr.
sigal,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
don't
think
we're
fighting
here
about
who
should
go
to
the
board
first.
i
think
we're
fighting
here
about
whether
301
can
be
construed
and
applied
to
require
a
court
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
under
these
circumstances.
now
--
and
i
think
we
can
measure
this
case
or
test
this
case
in
terms
of
--
of
two
assumptions
and
i
think
mr.
sigal
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
right
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
see
where
the
union
has
the
right
to
force
us
into
the
board
because
as
a
man's
arbitration
of
something
that
has
no
business
before
a
bilateral
contract
arbitrator.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
your
honor
i
--
i
don't
think
there
are
here
to
force
us
to
in
--
into
the
board.
i
think
there
here
to
gain
something,
and
i
think
they're
here
to
gain
more
than
a
metaphysical
value
that
adheres
in
having
rights
determined
as
contract
matter
as
distinguished
from
a
statutory
matter,
after
that
metaphysical
advantage
of
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
--
contract
determination
theory
after
representation
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
that's
right.
that
i'd
assert
as
an
opinion,
that's
not
the
fact
of
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
down
to
the
real
--
who
--
to
the
question
of
who
is
talking
about
reality
when
we
talk
about
harm.
assuming
there
is
an
iue
award
favoring
--
an
arbitrator's
award
favoring
iue
on
this
controversy,
is
it
realistic
to
think
that
no
consequences
whatsoever
will
ensue
and
i
think
this
goes
to
your
honor's
question
there?
is
it
unrealistic
to
think
that
iue
will
seek
enforcement
of
the
award
if
we
decline
to
imply
--
comply
with
it?
is
it
unrealistic
to
think
that
federation
will
acquiesce
in
it?
well
no
will
decline
to
act
acquiesce
in
it
and
will
seek
to
vindicate
whatever
rights
it
feels
that
has
under
its
contract
or
under
those
statutes.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
is
realistic
to
assume
that
federation
may
acquiesce
in
this
because
federation
had
stayed
out
of
this
case
from
the
very
beginning.
as
a
matter
of
legal
counseling,
federation
silences
the
precise
prescription
for
a
person
who
does
not
intend
to
be
bound
by
what
is
transpiring
here
and
would
not
intend
to
be
bound
by
what
may
transpire
before
an
iue-westinghouse
arbitrator.
is
it
unrealistic
to
think
that
present
engineering
laboratory
employees
who,
if
iue
is
successful,
maybe
laid
off
or
find
themselves
represented
by
iue
contrary
to
their
wishes,
will
seek
some
sort
of
redress
either
through
their
existing
union,
federation
or
through
board
proceeding?
we
don't
think
we
are
dealing
with
unreality
and
with
speculative
problems.
arbitrators
themselves
who
are
very
familiar
with
what's
realistic
in
industrial
relations
have
spoken
in
closely
analogous
context
on
this.
arbitrator
schadler
in
a
recent
decision
in
crown
cork
&
seal,
in
concluding
that
he
had
no
power
to
order
a
rival
union
to
become
a
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
arbitration
involving
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
said
that
in
light
of
the
employer's
dilemma
of
situations
such
as
this,
a
three-party
proceeding
binding
on
both
the
unions
and
the
employer
is
the
ideal
solution.
was
the
dilemma
he
spoke
of
a
fantasy
of
his
imagination?
was
he
recommending
a
solution
to
a
non-existing
problem?
arbitrator
schalder
hiley
has
said
in
the
remington
rand
case,
another
recent
case
that
n.l.r.b.
is
the
logical
place
for
the
re
--
resolution
of
what
is
an
inherent
representation
conflict
articulated
in
the
grievance
sought
to
be
arbitrated
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i'm
sure
he
was
not
wasting
his
logic
on
a
fictitious
difficulty.
in
the
view
of
arbitrators
conversant
with
the
realities
in
this
situation,
it
is
petitioner
and
not
respondent
who
fails
to
face
up
to
reality
here.
the
problems
and
dilemmas
we
cite
are
quite
real.
parenthetically,
these
arbitrators'
views
of
this
matter
are
not
irrelevant
to
the
proper
construction
of
301
because
it
would
seem
that
in
their
view
or
at
least
in
the
view
of
the
better
arbitrators,
bilateral
collective
bargaining
arbitration
in
these
three-way
disputes
does
not
--
is
not
a
useful
tool
and
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
properly
employed
in
this
three-way
situation.
now,
that
--
that's
sort
of
a
basic
conclusion
of
a
lot
of
good
arbitrators,
and
that's
really
in
a
many
respects
of
the
heart
of
this
case.
now,
we
say
that
301
is
involved
and
--
and
we
go
back
to
lincoln
mills
as
to
what
301
means.
now,
lincoln
mills
said
that
301
was
a
mandate
to
the
courts
to
build
in
the
old
common
law
methodology
as
it
were
a
--
a
corpus
of
federal
labor
contract
law
and
that
in
that
building,
and
this
was
expressly
noted
in
lincoln
mills,
you
will
borrow
policy
emanations
from
other
sections
of
the
act.
now,
they
must
have
mean
policy
emanations
other
than
arbitration.
it
weren't
limiting
the
policy
emanations
to
sections
201
and
203
(d).
now,
in
steel
workers,
the
only
policy
emanation
in
--
in
the
--
from
the
act
that
was
to
remain
in
the
steel
workers
301
decision
was
the
policy
favoring
final
and
binding
arbitration
of
employer
union
disputes.
here,
we
have
a
case
unlike
steel
workers
which
brings
you
back
to
what
was
said
in
lincoln
mills.
you
have
to
go
and
look
at
the
policies
of
section
7,
section
9.
and
--
and
those
policies
certainly
who
represents
serious
questions
as
to
exercise
of
301
jurisdiction
here.
and
that
question
on
301
should
be
in
the
spirit
of
lincoln
mills
and
attempt
to
evolve
a
coherent
and
rational
scheme
for
the
rest
--
enforcement
of
the
--
of
rights
in
the
resolution
of
disputes
looking
to
the
overall
purpose
of
congress.
we
think
that
--
that
the
question
is,
would
--
that
congress
express
--
expressly
or
impliedly,
a
view
that
this
--
that
that
301
should
be
used
to
force
arbitration
here
or
if
you
could
read
congress'
tentative
mind
on
this,
would
congress
have
said,
no
this
ought
to
go
to
the
board.
that's
not
a
very
orderly
way
to
handle
it
and
have
an
arbitration
and
then
assuming
iue
gets
what
it
wants
in
arbitration
to
have
all
this
other
litigation
and
all
this
peril
which
we're
here
defending
against,
simply
to
vindicate
what
is
called
a
contract
right.
now,
we
think
that
the
--
the
--
looking
at
the
other
policies
of
the
act
that
they
very
strongly
impinge
on
--
on
the
decision
in
this
case.
in
garment
workers
versus
the
board,
the
decision
of
this
court
held
that
an
employer
in
a
union
may
not
hoist
representation
upon
employees
through
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
remedy
given
by
the
board
there
was
that
the
contract
was
to
be
set
aside
and
recognition
was
to
be
withheld
until
such
time
as
the
union
would
certify
in
a
board
election.
so
far
as
the
board
policy
of
the
--
the
statutory
policies
under
section
7
are
concerned,
this
characterization
dispute
we
have
is
between
work
assignment
and
representational
grievance
doesn't
seem
critical.
whether
iue's
aim
in
arbitration
is
to
add
federation
represented
employees
by
taking
a
piece
of
the
unit
or
to
take
the
work
which
requires
the
layoffs
from
the
federation
seniority
list
and
get
those
same
people
back
onto
its
--
its
--
doing
a
work
under
the
jurisdiction
of
its
unit.
the
fact
is
that
federation
will
have
fewer
working
members
if
iue
wins
and
iue
will
have
more
working
members
if
--
if
iue
wins
--
if
--
if
it
wins
its
arbitration
award.
now,
one
objection
to
the
applicability
of
section
7
policies
guaranteeing
employees'
rights
and
they
are
the
--
another
group
of
third
parties
not
represented
here
is
that
the
arbitrator
might
fortuitously
arrive
at
the
same
result
as
the
board.
that
is
to
say
that
the
board
could
agree
with
the
union
and
could
also
agree
that
there
are
not
sufficient
number
of
people
involved
so
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
merely
to
clarify
this
fringing
without
another
election.
but
the
board
isn't
going
to
clarify
this
group
in
without
another
election,
without
being
guided
by
the
statutory
criteria
on
--
of
section
9
which
is
a
command
to
the
board
to
do
as
much
as
possible
in
shaping
these
units
and
enacting
under
section
9
to
implement
the
rights
assured
by
section
7,
the
employee
right.
if
the
arbitrator
felt
very
strongly
that
employee
rights
were
being
infringed
here
and
that
they're
ought
to
be
at
self-determination
election
or
something
about
the
sort
here,
he
has
no
power
to
order
an
election.
the
contract
arbitrator
can
only
say
as
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation,
you
intended
this
or
that.
now,
if
he
agrees
with
iue,
he's
going
to
enter
an
award
which
will
obligate
us
to
recognize
iue
in
respect
to
this
group.
but
he
can't
--
if
he
enters
any
award
at
all,
unless
he
concludes
that
it's
not
arbitrable,
all
he
can
do
is
interpret
the
contract.
the
court's
decision
in
garment
workers
against
the
board
demonstrates
that
even
good
faith
recognition
is
unlawful,
if
the
union
in
fact
does
represent
a
majority
of
employees
and
in
a
--
in
a
--
in
an
appropriate
unit.
so
the
reality
is
that
absence
of
certification,
an
employer
acts
at
his
peril.
the
respondent
has
historically
always
required
certifications,
not
only
because
of
solicitude
for
employee
rights
but
to
avoid
this
peril
which
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
in
which
the
act
accorded
us
the
right
to
do
and
the
procedures
to
do
it.
now,
we
have
an
important
interest
because
as
i
say,
i
--
i
believe
there
are
literally
64
different
unions
that
deal
with
respondent
here
and
--
and
many,
many
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
plans
that
respondent
have
five,
six,
10
unions
in
the
same
plant
and
we've
got
to
be
very
careful
in
this
area.
now,
i'm
not
telling
you
my
problems
that
i
should
be
telling
to
an
arbitrator
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
we
very
carefully
limited
our
dealings
with
unions
to
certified
units
and
we
very
carefully
limited
our
contracts
to
certified
units
in
haec
verba.
if
we
are
to
be
put
to
the
perils
which
i
think
genuinely
exist
in
this
case,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
by
slim
chance
they
could
all
be
avoided
in
the
various
mostly
assumed
circumstances.
what
is
the
source
of
this
peril
to
us?
you
don't
find
the
source
of
the
peril
in
any
other
section
of
the
act,
you
can't
find
it
in
the
agreement
and
i
say
you
can't
find
it
in
301.
i
don't
think
301
created
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
as
the
highest
value
in
our
labor
society.
enforcement
of
contract
rights
has
always
been
a
high
social
value.
in
--
in
some
cases,
it
has
constitutional
dignity
in
our
society.
the
courts
don't
rottenly
enforce
contracts
that
because
of
the
value
embodied
in
--
in
the
ancient
phrase
"pacta
sunt
servanda.”
they
look
to
other
social
values,
particularly
those
expressed
in
--
in
legislation
and
--
and
very
frequently,
courts
refuse
to
enforce
contracts.
now,
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
act
has
many,
many
coordinate
values
and
the
reference
is,
what
would
congress
have
intended?
and
when
we
think
there's
just
too
much
violence
to
all
the
other
values
of
the
act
to
give
very
much
weight
to
this
(inaudible)
of
contract
right.
iue
says,
"we
have
a
contract
right
and
we
can't
vindicate
that
contract
right
before
the
board,"
i
--
i
think
it
should
be
conceded
that
they
can
get
relief
in
a
--
in
a
nine
--
nine
proceeding
before
the
board.
but
--
but
they
say,
"that's
only
going
to
be
statutory
vindication
and
we
want
contract
vindication."
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
an
important
contract
right
here.
the
contract
was
to
be
bound
by
the
board's
decision.
the
contract
was
to
be
bound
by
the
board
orders
so
the
contract
right
exist
that
can
be
articulated
as
a
contract
right
but
it
is
an
important
contract
right
when
you
measure
it
against
the
section
7
rights,
our
rights
to
be
free
of
harassment
in
inter-union
jurisdictional
disputes
and
all
the
other
consequences
that
inhere
in
this
situation.
now,
we
are
taken
to
test
because
we
haven't
articulated
a
proper
doctrine
to
--
to
be
--
to
be
applied
here.
we
--
we
haven't
relied
on
the
preemption
cases
and
the
terms
of
the
garmon
case
in
the
state
federal
preemption
cases.
now,
we
--
we
have
--
we
appreciate
that
we
can't
ask
the
court
to
rule
that
on
these
narrow
facts
and
know
more
without
opinion,
this
case
was
correctly
decided.
there
must
be
some
rule
of
construction
--
of
301
that
--
that
we
are
espousing
here.
the
--
it
has
been
charged
that
any
rule
of
--
of
301,
any
facet
of
301
that
we
want
enunciated
here
is
going
to
give
rise
to
bad
faith
litigation
by
employers.
i
don't
think
that's
a
reason
for
saying
301
permits
of
no
exceptions.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
some
employer
may
buy
intricate
inference
upon
a
representation
aspect
of
the
grievance
and
then
tried
to
bought
301
enforcement
act.
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
case
which
does
involve
issues
of
representation.
now,
it's
the
function
of
the
courts
to
see
whether
this
is
truly
involved
in
grievances
which
are
defended
against
on
--
for
this
reason.
the
appellate
division
below
articulated
the
best
we
can
do
on
--
on
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
appellant
division
said,
"where
the
question
of
representation
is
direct
and
the
question
of
contract
breach
peripheral,
arbitration
should
be
withheld
indifference
to
board
procedures.
whereas,
if
the
question
of
representation
is
peripheral
and
the
question
of
contract
breach
direct,
arbitration
should
be
preceded
with
notwithstanding
the
possible
existence
of
board
jurisdiction
over
--
or
an
aspect
of
the
controversy.”
now,
that
isn't
--
those
are
words
direct
and
peripheral
and
they
require
judging,
they
require
the
lower
courts
to
say
does
this
directly
revolve
representation
of
an
importantly
involved
representation.
but
we
just
can't
come
up
with
a
rule
that
doesn't
involve
some
degree
of
judging.
now,
the
exception
to
arbitrability
or
the
enforcement
of
the
arbitrability
clauses
which
iue
talks
about
is
barbed
right
out
of
the
contract
hornbooks.
the
contract
hornbooks
say,
"the
contract
is
enforceable
if
the
court
has
jurisdictional
of
the
parties
and
if
it
is
not
an
illegal
contract."
now,
i
think
301
meant
something
more
than
--
than
(inaudible)
on
contracts.
i
mean,
this
is
not
the
ordinary
commercial
contract
which
should
be
enforced
if
legal
and
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
overlay
of
the
subject
matter.
301
contemplated
a
little
more
particularization
in
the
old
hornbook
of
contract
enforcements
and
--
and
the
challenging
thing
in
this
case
is
how
you
mesh
the
policies
in
favor
of
collective
bargaining
arbitration,
although
the
very
real
violence
to
those
policies
that
seems
to
inhere
in
this
case.
if
it
has
to
be
done
on
a
case-by-case
basis
that
so
be
it.
but
there
is
not
a
clearer
case
than
the
present
case
of
a
direct
representational
issue.
there
is
not
a
clearer
case
in
the
present
case.
i
don't
know
where
to
draw
the
line
beyond
the
present
case
but
this
case
has
two
certified
unit,
mutually
exclusive.
this
federation
--
the
engineering
lab
employ
people
as
a
class
voted
in
the
federation
election
and
they
did
not
vote
in
the
production
and
maintenance
collection.
and
--
and
we
have
--
we
have
--
are
sitting
in
that
status
quo
and
we
say
if
the
iue
wants
to
change,
it
ought
to
go
before
the
board.
and
--
and
i
--
i
am
--
i
hope
i
was
--
i
--
i
assume
i
guess,
i
was
not
responsive
justice
stewart
--
justice
white
but
is
it
a
sufficient
answer
to
say
that
if
we
lose
this
case,
we
can
go
to
the
board?
that
does
that
give
the
union
a
right
to
win
it?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
we
can
go
to
the
board
and
--
and
alleviate
some
of
these
consequences
that
adhere
in
what
--
in
the
construction
of
301
for
which
iue
speaks
in
this
case.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
that's
--
that
justification
for
construing
301.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
well,
you
know
your
honor,
our
defense
below
at
special
term
was
two-fold.
we
said
we
have
not
consented
to
arbitration
but
even
if
you
construe
the
agreement
as
embodying
that
consent,
we
say
that
the
board
process
is
ought
to
be
differed
to
under
these
facts.
now,
the
reason
we
said
we
did
not
consent
was
not
because
we
were
going
against
the
--
the
holding
steel
workers
at
all.
we
said
that
we
--
the
agreement
should
not
be
--
should
be
viewed
as
not
having
embodied
our
consent
to
this
because
of
--
of
what
shows
on
the
face
of
the
recognition
clause.
it
is
not
an
irrational
inference
from
the
recognition
clause
which
says,
"for
those
units
of
employees
where
they
can
lawfully
elect,
in
a
lawful
board
proceeding"
i
mean
is
it
--
it's
not
irrational
to
say
that
we
didn't
intend
to
arbitrate
that.
now,
the
courts
below
did
not
decide
this
as
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
viewed
as
a
whole
should
be
construed
as
withholding
our
consent
to
the
arbitration
of
this
grievance.
they
went
directly
to
our
second
defense
which
was
that
conceding
arguendo.
we've
consented
to
this
arbitration.
it
--
it
just
isn't
the
right
thing
to
do
under
301,
under
all
these
circumstances.
so
i
--
i
don't
know
that
--
that
the
differences
--
well,
i
have
some
ad
hoc
differences
with
certain
things
with
mr.
cox
had
said.
i
think
it
--
it
has
become
apparent
that
the
principal
difference
between
our
position
and
the
--
one
--
one
of
the
principal
differences
between
our
position
and
out
of
the
united
states
and
the
board,
views
which
are
reflected
here
is
the
weighing
of
these
policy
values
and
these
disadvantages
permits
exercise
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
that
weighing
is
up
--
of
course
to
this
court.
most
of
the
courts
below
that
have
weighed
this
and
i
appreciate
that
the
second
circuit
in
the
general
electric
case
was
to
the
contrary.
most
of
the
courts
below
have
felt
that
the
balance
tipped
against
arbitrability.
those
cases
are
cited
in
their
brief.
there
are
a
few
particularly
--
the
--
not
--
we
have
--
have
a
reply
brief
filed
here
and
--
which
i
would
not
--
not
to
offer
any
written
reply
too.
but
in
some
of
the
things
set
here.
these
railroad
adjustment
cases
aren't
really
applicable
here.
the
fact
that
you
can
be
forced
into
the
adjustment
board
with
one
union
--
without
the
other
union
being
present,
you've
got
the
same
adjustment
board
adjusting
these
things
so
i
don't'
think
those
cases
are
comparable.
mr.
sigal
said,
"the
board
may
deny
him
relief,
may
refuse
to
entertain
a
motion
to
clarify
under
section
9,"
and
then
therefore,
he's
got
to
have
this
arbitration.
but
your
honors,
if
the
board
refuses
his
motion
to
clarify,
it's
because
there
are
too
many
people
newly
in
this
group
to
just
clarify
them
in
without
any
expression
of
their
own
wishes.
so
if
he's
refused
a
--
a
relief
on
a
motion
to
clarify
is
because
in
the
board's
view,
the
policies
of
the
act
would
be
squarely
offended
by
it
by
--
by
the
relief
he
seeks
here
from
the
arbitrator.
it's
been
noted
that
everybody
who
--
who's
briefed
this
case
agrees
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
call
other
work
assignment
grievance
or
a
representational
grievance
but
they
agree
for
different
reasons
and
--
and
i
--
i
would
not
let
to
--
like
the
court
to
think
that
that
is
completely
irrelevant.
we
say
it
makes
no
difference
not
because
there
aren't
some
work
assignment
disputes
that
that
--
where
there
has
been
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
them,
albeit
between
the
employer
and
the
union
should
not
be
arbitrated.
we
say
it
isn't
a
question
whether
you
call
it
work
assignment
or
representation,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
grievance.
now,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
grievance
under
steel
workers
your
honor.
you
can't
(inaudible)
look
at
the
grievance.
you
at
least
have
to
look
at
the
grievance
to
see
if
it's
comprehended
by
the
arbitration
clause.
and
while
you're
looking
--
the
courts
are
looking
at
the
grievance,
as
this
their
function
under
steel
workers,
if
they
see
all
the
elements
we
cite
here,
there's
no
extra
burden
to
judging
under
301
to
say,
"union,
you
better
go
to
the
board
with
this,"
this
--
or
our
congress
did
not
intend
that
--
that
bilateral
collective
bargaining
agreement
arbitration
be
the
institution
in
our
scheme
to
resolve
this
type
of
dispute.
it's
just
not
a
very
felicitous
institution
to
be
used
here.
it
seems,
and
i
infer
this
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act
that
congress
intended
the
board
be
the
institution
to
resolve
this
type
of
dispute.
and
i
know
that
we
have
entered
into
a
contract
agreeing
to
recognize
the
union
in
respect
to
board
determined
units
and
i
know
that
we've
entered
into
a
contract
agreeing
to
arbitrate
claim
violations
of
the
agreement,
but
notwithstanding
our
agreement.
i
say
that
if
you
read
9
(c),
reading
entirety
of
9
and
the
whole
scheme
it
creates,
this
question
of
unit
scope
was
intended
by
the
board
--
by
congress
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
board
because
and
this
is
an
--
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
case.
it
is
only
the
board
that
can
bind
us,
the
iue,
the
federation
and
all
of
employees
affected
and
exclude
all
of
the
unions.
it's
only
the
board
that
has
power
to
bind
the
whole
country
as
it
were
and
to
vindicate
the
purposes
and
policies
of
other
sections
of
the
act
in
this
9
(c)
proceeding.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
yesterday
justice
white
asked
whether
the
company's
right
to
go
to
the
board
and
to
obtain
a
board
adjudication
of
the
controversy
did
not
take
a
lot
of
sting
out
of
what
we
said
where
the
undesirable
elements
of
bilateral
arbitration,
and
thereby
militate
against
a
construction
of
section
301
which
we
speak
for.
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
what
i
said
yesterday,
because
i
think
that
if
there
is
such
a
mitigation,
we
are
faced
with
a
peculiar
circularity,
if
the
grievance
is
arbitrable,
if
301
must
be
construed
as
my
adversaries
contend,
and
we
go
to
the
board,
the
day
the
301
action
has
commenced,
the
board
certainly
would
not
enjoin
the
301
action
nor
it
would
have
authority
to
do
so.
the
court
would
not
state
a
301
action
because
of
the
reversal
of
this
decision
here
now,
and
then
we
would
proceed
through
the
arbitration,
and
get
an
award,
the
iue
would
get
an
award
under
this
hypothesis
and
i
think
it
is
proper
to
assume
for
purposes
of
analysis
that
the
board
determination
is
contrary
to
the
arbitrator's
award,
we
then
have
the
same
conflict
at
that
juncture
that
we
have
here.
one
would
think
that
the
arbitrator's
award
would
become
nullified
by
a
contrary
board
award,
but
the
basis
of
mr.
sigal's
position
is
that
that
the
arbitrator's
award
gives
him
a
contract
right
which
is
heretically
different
from
the
board
determination
of
a
statutory
right,
but
you
cannot
avoid
the
conflict.
now,
i
think
it
was
assumed
yesterday
that,
of
course,
the
arbitrator's
award
would
fall
against
a
contrary
board
award,
but
if
this
distinction
between
contract
right
and
statutory
right
is
valid,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
that
the
arbitrator's
award
would
fall.
now,
the
congress
did
speak
in
the
statute
fairly
directly
on
the
subject
of
conflict
between
board
determinations
and
determinations
from
any
other
source,
not
excluding
arbitration
and
that
section
i
referred
to
was
section
10
(a),
i
referred
to
it
in
my
brief
at
page
32;
10(a)
–
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
of
the
brief
page
32,
your
honor.
10
(a)
which
goes
back
to
the
wagner
act
provides
that
the
power
of
the
board
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices,
matters
cognizable
under
8
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
that
has
been
or
may
be
established
by
agreement
or
otherwise.
now,
the
omission
of
any
--
here
congress
is
addressing
itself
the
conflict
and
it
talks
only
about
conflict
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
concurrency.
there
is
no
statement
whatsoever
to
cover
the
situation
of
a
conflict
between
a
unit
determination
under
section
9
and
a
determination
of
the
same
controversy
by
some
other
means
of
adjustment
established
by
agreement
such
as
arbitration.
do
we
infer
from
10
(a)
that
the
board's
power
over
units
is
not
paramount?
i
think
the
board's
power
over
units
is
the
most
unreviewable
administrative
determination
that
exists
virtually
in
our
law.
the
board's
discretion
over
units
is
one
of
the
most
unfettered
agency
discretions
in
our
federal
administrative
system.
i
think
i
infer
that
congress
could
not
even
conceive
of
there
being
a
conflict
between
a
board-determined
unit
and
a
unit-determined
determined
by
some
other
means
of
adjustment,
agreement
or
a
law.
i
don't
think
congress
could
conceive
of
this
situation
and
had
it
done
so,
it
certainly
would
have
elaborated
in
10
(a)
when
it
addressed
itself
to
the
subject
of
concurrency
and
conflict.
from
that
i
inferred
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
301
be
used
to
have
an
arbitrator
review,
or
court
makes
no
difference,
review
a
board-determined
unit
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
review
sought
here
concerns.
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
idea
that
the
two
proceedings
can
go
along
concurrently
without
doing
any
harm.
if
we
are
wrong,
we
have
no
right
to
force
the
union
into
court
under
301.
there
shouldn't
have
been
an
action.
we
should
have
just
agreed
to
arbitrate.
we
should've
proceeded
with
arbitration.
now
if
the
harm,
we
say,
should
be
avoided
by
affirmance
here
can
equally
be
avoided
by
our
going
to
the
board
and
if
the
reason
that
is
an
--
would
be
an
adequate
answer
is
that
the
arbitrator
may
not
proceed
and
avoid
and
resolve,
i
first
referred
to,
do
we
have
--
but
because
of
reversal
here,
we
go
into
arbitration;
we
don't
force
the
union
to
go
to
court.
we
go
the
board
but
to
stop
the
arbitration,
we
ourselves
have
to
go
to
court
as
well
as
to
the
board
for
declaratory
judgment
under
301
that
the
arbitrator
should
not
be
proceeding
and
therefore,
should
be
enjoined
from
proceeding.
so
i
think
you
can't
avoid
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
conflict,
whether
the
exercise
of
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
presents
a
sufficiently
serious
problem
that
should
not
be
permitted
in
the
overall
scheme
of
orderly
adjustment
of
labor
disputes.
now
if
you
--
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
your
honor,
i
completely
agree
with
smith.
in
fact,
the
briefs
below
show
that
i
stipulated
the
rule
of
smith
beginning
in
special
term.
the
unfair
labor
practice
concurrency
does
not
bar
arbitration
and
i've
stipulated
that
some
special
term
before
smith.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
certification
is
a
different
question.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
--
at
least,
and
here
where
there
are
two
outstanding
orders
which
are
report
to
be
neutrally
exclusive.
now,
another
factor
i
would
like
to
bring
into
this
argument
is
we
keep
talking
about
arbitration
and
the
reason
why
arbitration
will
be
helpful
here,
it
may
induce
the
federation
to
acquiescence
loss
of
jobs
or
people,
whatever
maybe
involved.
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
board
when
the
controversy
ultimately
comes
before
the
board.
now
if
you
look
at
the
agreement,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
arbitration
is
the
last
step
following
a
four-step
grievance
procedure.
the
normal
way
to
handle
plant
controversies
is
not
to
go
to
an
arbitrator;
it's
to
go
to
shop
steward,
supervisor,
grievance
and
so
on
up
to
the
national
grievance
level.
when
the
grievance
procedures,
which
are
highly
favored
by
congress,
break
down,
when
they
don't
work,
then
you
go
to
arbitration,
but
if
the
union
is
right
here
and
i
think
justice
brennan
perhaps
had
this
in
mind
in
one
of
his
questions
yesterday,
well
supposing
we
had
agreed
at
the
grievance
level
here,
supposing
we
had
agreed
with
the
iue's
contentions
and
then
transferred
the
workers
or
employees,
we
wouldn't
have
solved
any
problems
because
then
the
case
would
be
here
captioned
federation
against
westinghouse.
i
mean
we
just
can't
agree
at
the
grievance
procedure,
at
the
grievance
level
to
this
type
of
bilateral
adjustment
of
a
trilateral
dispute;
we
just
can't
do
it.
but
in
theory,
if
the
arbitrator
can
do
it
in
his
award,
we
can
do
it
as
a
grievance
level.
now
as
in
the
side,
we
do
not
have
an
umpire
for
the
industry
here.
we
have
arbitrators
selected
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
on
a
aaa
list,
and
i
don't
demean
them
at
all,
but
i
do
object
to
the
demeaning
of
the
board's
expertise
in
this
area,
and
the
reference
to
the
board
as
an
agency
reviewing
on
paper
records
in
washington.
in
legal
theory,
the
decision
is
the
board's,
but
there
is
certainly
a
reality
that
the
initial
decisional
power
is
delegated
to
a
hearing
officer
and
they
sit
all
over
the
country
and
they
can
go
into
plants
and
they
do
go
into
plants
and
they
have
full
process
over
parties
and
over
evidence
which
an
arbitrator
does
not.
this
contract
arbitrator
does
not
have
full
process
powers
over
evidence
let
alone
other
parties
and
witnesses.
so
it's
the
board
hearing
examiner
that
the
arbitrator
is
competing
with
here,
not
the
board
itself
and
the
board
hearing
examiner
is
certainly
expert
with
the
same
kind
of
problem
of
job
classification.
he
is
an
expert
on
the
board's
section
9
criteria,
and
they
must
be
involved
here
because
all
these
rights
and
relations
depend
on
propriety
of
unit,
an
issue
which
can
only
be
decided
under
section
9
criteria.
now
if
my
adversaries
are
right,
there
is
no
exception
to
arbitrability
here.
they
talk
about
the
one
or
two
employee
case,
but
i
could
talk
about
a
case
that
came
out
of
arbitration
after
my
brief
was
filed,
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
case
to
consider
here.
it
is
reported
at
this
year's
daily
labor
reports,
number
155
at
page
d1
that's
the
october
7th.
dlr
195
page
d1
involves
the
univac
division
of
remington
rand.
the
employer
had
a
plan
in
utica
for
which
iue,
petitioner
here,
was
a
certified
representative
of
production
and
maintenance
workers.
it
had
another
plant
at
a
fairly
close
by
town
called
ilion
at
which
iam
machinist
union
is.
it
was
a
certified
representative
of
production
and
maintenance
workers.
it
unilaterally
closed
down
the
utica
plant
and
consolidated
operations
at
ilion.
it
offered
all
the
utica
employees
jobs
at
ilion,
but
continued
to
recognize
the
machinist
at
ilion
in
respect
of
all
employees
and
putting
those
transferred
from
the
iue
jurisdiction
at
the
utica
plant.
iue
sought
arbitration
and
the
employer
there
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
steel
workers,
this
court
said
in
steel
workers,
unless
you
bargain
away
your
right
to
a
judicial
determination,
you
have
it,
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
letting
the
arbitrator
decide
arbitrability.
that's
also,
that
would
be
subject
to
review
on
this
award,
but
it's
the
difference
in
procedure
here.
but
that
went
to
the
arbitrator,
but
the
employer
contested
on
the
grounds
of
arbitrability,
not
on
the
merits
as
we
did
in
the
301
action
involved.
now
here
he
concluded
that
the
grievance
was
not
arbitrable
and
he
did
not
do
so
on
the
basis
of
legal
precedent
and
feel
bound
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
decision
here.
he
didn't
feel
himself
bound
by
precedent.
he
said
that
it
was
non-arbitrable
in
his
view,
because
of
the
simple
fact
that
in
utica,
there
is
a
legally
certified
union
with
the
exclusive
right
to
represent
all
production
and
maintenance
of
employees
of
the
utica
plant.
he
said
that
any
reasonable
person
would
have
to
conclude
that
a
verdict
favoring
iue
would
constitute
an
attack
on
the
certification
scope
of
the
utica
iam
unit.
once
this
simple
fact
is
acknowledged,
it
places
the
issue
on
proper
perspective
namely,
which
union
is
entitled
to
represent
the
transferees
and
under
whose
agreement
all
the
rights
and
responsibilities
be
determined.
this
is
clearly
a
representation
question
and
one
for
the
nlrb.
i
can
appreciate
the
hardship
involved
here,
but
i
note
that
in
denying
arbitrability
of
the
grievance
nothing
in
this
opinion
should
be
construed
as
prejudicial
to
whatever
rights
the
union
may
have
in
the
proper
arena.
so
he
just
made
an
arbitrability
determination,
and
he
said
that
his
view
as
matter
of
logic
and
common
sense,
this
was
not
an
arbitrable
grievance.
now
he
is
not
bound
by
301.
i
don't
have
significant
values,
but
arbitrators
are,
they
are
powered
to
rise
under
301,
but
they
are
not
bound
by
301,
but
i
think
we
have
to
have
a
common
standard
of
arbitrability
between
arbitrators
and
the
courts.
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
who
determines
arbitrability.
if
you
look
at
the
utica-ilion
situation,
if
you,
as
the
contract
matter
said,
iue
has
the
continued
right
to
represent
former
utica
employees
at
ilion
in
this
merged
production
and
maintenance
unit.
it
just
couldn't
work,
it
is
just
chaotic.
you
can't
have
two
bargaining
representatives
for
the
same
group
of
employees.
it
is
a
fundamental
breakdown
on
the
whole
concept
of
collective
bargaining.
i
mean
mine
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
act.
there's
got
to
be
an
election
district,
an
appropriate
election,
an
election
of
a
bargaining
representative,
and
then
the
employer
deals
with
the
bargaining
representative.
and
you
just
can't
have
it
unclear
who
represents
whom
in
the
shop.
now
that
case
is
more
dramatic
than
my
case
because
we're
not
dealing
with
an
entire
plan;
we're
dealing
with
the
engineering
laboratory.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
a
question
of
degree;
i
think
it's
a
question
of
principle.
if
the
thrust
of
a
grievance
is
the
enlargement
of
representational
jurisdiction,
no
matter
what
other
labels
you've
put
on,
it
should
not
be
arbitrable.
now,
it
has
been
said
that
everybody
in
this
case
agrees,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
than
what
you
call
a
grievance,
and
i
agree
with
that
too.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you
call
this
grievance,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
i'm
taking
the
position
that
any
work
assignment
grievance
is
arguable,
as
solicitor
general
cox
gave
the
example
of
a
run
of
a
mill
dispute
in
which
the
employer
threw
in
the
proposition,
well
this
fellow
is
a
supervisor
anyway.
now
that
doesn't
deter
arbitrability
in
that
case.
if
the
issue
truly
is
whether
he
is
a
supervisor,
it
is
a
status
determination,
which
i
would
think
would
have
to
be
made
on
the
act,
but
i
don't
have
to
go
so
far
in
this
case.
i
say
that
the
status
of
collective
bargaining
representative
has
to
be
determined
by
the
board.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
your
honor,
binding
the
federation
under
301
would
be
helpful
here.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
it
would
be,
but
it
couldn't
solve
all
the
problem.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
did
both
unions
agree?
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
if
we
entered
into
such
an
agreement,
most
of
the
problems
i
referred
to
would
not
occur,
but
the
employees
will
disagree
with
it,
not
the
union.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
enforceable
in
the
courts
under
301.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
your
honor,
i
need
to
say
that
if
one
of
the
three
parties
to
that
tripartite
agreement
wants
to
welsh,
i
think
maybe
the
public
interest
requires
that
he
be
permitted
to
welsh.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
301
impose
that
risk
on;
we
don't
voluntarily
assume
it.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
oh,
yes,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
if
the
federation
would
have
lasted
our
arbitration
agreement,
why
should
they
give
up
jobs,
because
of
somebody
says
the
iue
contract
means
that
the
federation
has
no
rights
here.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
circularity
in
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
well,
the
employees,
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
union's
three-way
agreement,
wouldn't
be
welshing
if
they
went
to
the
board
or
a
completely
separate
unit
that
says
aha,
there
are
no
longer
certified
units
here
and
under
8
(b)
(4)
(c),
i
can
go
after
the
groups
over
there.
we
lose
our
8
(b)
(4)
(c)
protection
and
we
haven't
bargained
away
that.
now
if
an
employer
has
bargained
it
away
as
against
unrepresented
from
a
group
of
employees,
maybe
the
same,
all
the
same
considerations
don't
apply,
but
as
against
another
certified
union,
i
just
can't
believe
that
we
should
have
those
risks
imposed
upon
us
because
of
the
principles
of
steel
workers
favoring
arbitrability
where
there
were
no
countervailing
policy
considerations,
but
here
there
are
just
so
many
countervailing
policy
considerations
but
i
think
the
best
construction
of
301
that
maybe
made
realistically,
this
is
a
real
problem,
arbitrators
have
recognized
it,
mr.
cox
recognized
it,
this
is
a
real
problem
and
i
would
shape
301
and
you
have
a
blank
check
really
on
301
on
this
issue
so
far,
i
would
shape
301
and
not
to
follow
the
hornbook
rule
that
contracts
are
enforceable
unless
against
public
policy,
because
arbitration,
obviously,
isn't
against
public
policy,
but
shape
the
rule
and
in
this
peculiar
area
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it's
a
unique
agreement,
you
can't
go
to
courtroom
to
get
much
information
on
collective
bargaining
agreements,
but
we
are
going
to
have
to
have
some
special
rules.
maybe
we're
going
to
have
to
have
awhile
to
work
out
the
lines
here,
but
i
say
we
are
on
the
non-arbitrable
side
of
the
line
or
if
301
should
be
so
construed,
basically,
i
do
not
think
congress
intended
that
bilateral
industrial
arbitration
was
a
felicitous
means
for
resolving
controversies
of
this
type
because
there
is
only
one
forum
that
can
bind
all
parties
and
employees
and
implement
the
public
interest
reflected
in
various
sections
of
the
act
and
that
forum
is
the
board
and
the
controversy
of
this
type,
one
way
or
the
other,
are
going
to
get
to
the
board.
now
if
you
have
an
arbitrator's
award,
mr.
cox
has
said,
well,
there
is
a
problem
in
segregating
out
arbitrable
relations.
if
you
let
them
both
go
forward
in
tandem,
you're
going
to
have
that
same
problem
of
segregating
out
arbitrable
aspects
from
non-arbitrable
aspects
at
the
award
stage
instead
of
at
the
threshold
stage.
and
it's
just
not
an
orderly
procedure
to
have
all
these
proceedings
marching
down
and
have
the
conflict
come
at
the
end
of
the
road.
the
simplest
thing
is
let
the
board
say
who
represents
whom
and
then
the
particular
arbitration;
if
iue
wins
in
the
board,
then
the
arbitrator
is
usefully
employed
to
say,
well,
what
to
we
do
about
job
presentations
now?
there's
a
higher
skill
level
in
this
laboratory.
we're
going
to
have
to
get
the
iue
agreement
and
contemplate
these
job
classifications.
we're
going
to
have
to
adjust
the
agreement
into
the
new
situation.
that's
what
an
arbitrator
can
do
here,
but
he
will
be
doing
this
in
vain
if
it
isn't
the
representational
jurisdiction
to
begin
with.
so
let
the
board
first
say
what
the
unit
is
and
who
represents
whom
and
then
let
arbitrators
straighten
out
the
ad
hoc
problems
that
flow
from
status
determination,
but
don't
let
him
make
the
status
determination.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hunt,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
contract
bar
rule
here,
there
are
two
contracts
barring
each
other;
the
contact
bar
rule
nullifies
each
other.
now
board
differed
to
arbitration
in
reilys
and
more
recently
in
installation
and
specialties,
a
new
case,
to
say
what
the
contract
barred.
this
is
an
interpretation
of
a
contract
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
that
contract
precluded
another
union
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
well,
the
construction
on
that
contract
put
by
an
arbitrator
is
an
elaboration
which
helps
the
board
say
whether
the
contract
bar
rule
applies,
but
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
board
in
this
context
has
said
that
we're
going
to
hold
federation
bound
by
what
the
iue
arbitrator
said
the
iue
agreement
meant.
it
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
federation's
rights.
thank
you.
