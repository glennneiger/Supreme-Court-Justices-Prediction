mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
at
the
court's
invitation
and
i
sought
time
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
because
in
some
respects,
this
seems
to
us
to
be
a
complicated
case.
our
position
basically
reaches
the
same
result
as
the
petitioners.
we
think
that
the
courts
below
did
have
power
to
order
the
claim
to
arbitration,
that
therefore
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
at
the
outset,
it
seems
to
me
essential
that
have
a
clear
understanding
of
the
issue
that
the
union
sought
to
have
referred
to
arbitration,
not
because
the
court
needs
to
decide
it,
indeed
of
course
it
won't
decide
it,
but
because
that
characterizes
and
affects
the
whole
case.
in
our
view,
the
dispute
does
relate
to
the
representation
of
employee.
the
claim
as
it
was
setout
in
the
original
petition
which
is
the
procedure
in
new
york
for
securing
a
mandatory
--
mandate
to
arbitrate,
sets
forth
at
the
back
bottom
of
page
12
that
the
union
is
protesting
the
refusal
of
the
company
to
apply
the
national
agreement
to
related
supplement,
to
its
production
and
maintenance
employees
at
its
baltimore
plant.
then
it
goes
on
and
describes
the
work
their
engaged
in.
the
applicable
contract
provision
according
to
the
petition
is
the
recognition
clause
over
on
page
13
at
the
top,
where
the
company
agrees
to
recognize
the
union,
where
the
union
or
its
locals
through
a
lawful
national
labor
relations
board
certification,
has
been
lawfully
designated
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
and
then
there's
a
reference
later
in
the
paragraph,
two-board
certifications
that
are
made
a
part
of
the
agreement.
and
the
particular
certification
in
question
appears
at
the
bottom
of
that
page.
so
that
the
complaint
in
essence
is
that
the
company
violated
the
recognition
clause
by
not
recognizing
the
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
a
unit
described
in
the
contract
and
also
a
unit
which
had
been
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
think
that
it
follows
simply
from
this
statement
of
claim
that
the
company
is
right
in
saying
that
the
dispute
is
over
the
extent
of
the
union's
bargaining
rights.
it
is,
thus,
the
union
represents,
thus
the
contract
cover
the
employees
in
question.
that
is
not,
which
i
shall
explain
later,
what
we
say
is
a
work
assignment
dispute.
the
union
has
a
remedy
here
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
if
the
company
is
indeed
failing
to
bargain
with
it
as
the
representative
of
employees
within
the
unit
described
in
the
certification
and
in
the
contract,
then
that
is
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively,
a
charge
could
be
filed
and
presumably
a
complaint
would
issue.
equally,
the
union
and
also
the
employer
for
that
matter
could
file
a
motion
with
the
board
seeking
to
clarify
the
certification
and
thus
resolve
the
very
point
issue.
one
of
the
little
ironies
perhaps
irrelevant
of
this
case
is
that
the
company
is
talking
--
has
been
talking
for
three
and
a
half
years
about
the
need
for
a
national
labor
relations
board
determination
but
they've
never
taken
the
case
there
which
they
perfectly
well
could've
done
without
i
believe
abandoning
their
locality.
thus,
our
position
differs
a
little
from
part
of
mr.
sigal,
and
that
we
say
that
the
underlying
dispute
should
be
referred
to
arbitration
in
accordance
with
the
contract
even
though
there
is
a
remedy
before
the
board.
on
the
law,
two
really
settled
principles
or
policies,
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
starting
point.
the
first
is
that
it's
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
labor
management
reporting
act
to
encourage
the
arbitration
of
disputes
arising
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
of
where
the
parties
have
entered
into
a
consensual
agreement
for
arbitration.
and
the
second
is,
as
held
in
smith
against
the
evening
news
association,
neither
a
court
nor
an
arbitrator
loses
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
for
breach
of
contract
merely
because
the
labor
board
might
have
jurisdiction
over
the
same
person
so
that
here,
the
company
that
prevailed
has
the
burden
of
establishing
some
kind
of
an
exception
to
well-settled
principles.
we
can
lay
aside
at
once,
i
think,
the
--
the
company's
argument
and
exception
should
be
made
because
the
objective
of
the
iue
grievances
they
say
is
totally
repugnant
to
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
iue
says
that
what
maybe
greater
truth,
that
the
company's
conduct
is
totally
repugnant
to
the
act.
the
fact
is
of
course
that
at
this
stage,
both
of
those
assertions
assumedly
answered
to
the
underlying
dispute
of
which
is
still
unsettled.
there
are
just
four
things
that
i
think
can
be
said
at
this
stage.
first,
there
is
a
dispute
over
the
scope
of
the
bargaining
unit
as
to
which
either
the
petitioner
or
the
company
is
wrong
and
none
of
us
note
that
knows
which.
second,
the
dispute
could
be
settled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
third,
if
the
dispute
goes
to
an
arbitrator,
he
may
make
the
very
same
ruling
that
the
board
would
make
if
it
had
the
case
or
he
may
reach
a
different
conclusion
not
richer
than
the
willful
sense,
but
because
his
judgment
of
what
the
board
would
do
is
different
than
the
board's
own
judgment
of
what
it
would
do.
at
fourth,
an
award
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
would
not
bind
the
rival
union
which
could
thereafter
institute
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
against
the
employer
for
honoring
the
arbitrator's
award,
hoping
to
get
a
contrary
decision.
the
real
question,
therefore,
is
whether
arbitration
of
the
question
of
contract
interpretation
involving
representation
under
these
circumstances
threatens
such
interference
with
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
of
the
act
or
such
unfairness
to
employees
or
the
company
as
to
justify
an
exception
from
the
rule
laid
down
in
smith
against
the
evening
news
association.
submitting
the
dispute
over
the
precise
scope
of
the
bargaining
unit
to
arbitration
would
carry
no
real
threat
we
submit,
of
interference
with
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
with
the
operations
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
arbitrator,
when
he
interprets
the
contract,
will
be
following
the
language
of
a
board
certification.
presumably,
he
will
guide
himself
as
best
as
he
can
by
the
board
policies,
the
precedents
and
the
chance
that
he
will
reach
a
different
conclusion
than
the
--
the
board
would
reach
is
perhaps
not
very
great.
but
even
if
his
conclusions
were
different,
even
if
we
take
the
other
heart
of
the
dilemma,
there
would
be
no
significant
interference
with
the
policies
of
the
act.
this
dispute
and
the
thousands
of
disputes
like
it
are
concerned
with
the
classification
of
relatively
small
peripheral
groups
of
employees
who
could
probably
be
classified
in
one
unit
just
as
well
as
in
the
other
and
i've
often
wondered
why
the
flipping
of
coin
wouldn't
reach
just
as
sensible
result
as
the
mountains
of
papers
that
are
gone
through
in
representation
proceeding.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
its
interpretation
it's
--
i
suppose
that
it's
a
matter
of
application.
the
underlying
question
as
i
understand
it
is,
are
these
employees
in
the
laboratory
doing
what
may
properly
be
described
as
production
work
or
are
they
doing
what
they
properly
be
described
as
research
or
experimental
way?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
point
as
an
engineer
is
that
--
that
i
would
think
was
a
real
question
of
interpretation
if
that's
the
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
i
would
make
the
same
argument
if
anybody
was
fussing
about
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
wouldn't
be
absolutely
clear.
i
don't
think
that
a
court
should
say,
"or
we
are
satisfied
that
there's
no
doubt
about
the
board's
--
the
meaning
of
the
contract
or
the
meaning
of
the
certification
as
a
same
thing
and
therefore,
the
case
will
go
to
arbitration."
no,
i
would
most
empathically
argue
that
it
is
not
to
the
court
to
say
that
there
is
no
real
merit
to
the
claim
here
and
i
think
this
question
was
in
effect,
decided
by
the
enterprise
case
and
the
other
steel
workers
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
maybe.
they
may
well
be.
i'm
assuming
that
they
are
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
haven't
chosen
to
come
in
yet
and
protest,
though
whether
that
is
because
they
prefer
not
to
get
involved
in
this
or
whether
that's
--
they
prefer
to
let
the
company
carry
the
ball
for
them
or
whether
they're
not
interested
is
all
hypothetical
insofar
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
they
could
resolve
that
dispute
as
between
themselves.
the
other
union,
as
i
indicated,
would
not
be
bound
by
their
resolution.
it
would
have
on
such
other
remedies
before
the
board
or
possibly
elsewhere
as
might
be
available
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
but
i
suggest
that
that
is
not
advantage
enough
to
warrant
departing
from
what
is
the
settled
policy.
i
can't
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
are
deposing
considerations
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
there
are
some
disadvantages
either
way.
i
and
i
--i
do
plan
to
deal
with
those
things
specifically
and
one
of
my
assumptions
is
that
this
award
will
not
bind
--
will
not
certainly
bind
the
other
union.
there
are
some
things
that
tamper
that
without
attempt
to
an
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
doesn't.
no,
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
has
to
be
acknowledged
and
wrestled
with.
i
was
trying
to
suggest
that
in
terms
of
interference
with
policies
of
the
act,
then
i
come
to
the
matter
of
affecting
the
other
union
link.
that
in
terms
of
interference
with
the
policies
of
the
act,
there
is
no
real
chance
of
interference
because
this
is,
as
i
said,
a
very
small
peripheral
group
of
employees,
the
typical
dispute
of
this
kind.
we
cited
a
number
in
our
brief.
one
for
example
is
whether
a
man
classified
as
an
announcer-technician
belongs
in
the
unit
of
announcers
or
in
the
unit
of
technicians.
another
--
another
illustration
is
whether
a
man
who
is
doing
maintenance
work
and
powerhouse
equipment
outside
the
powerhouse
belongs
in
the
plant-wide
maintenance
unit
or
in
the
inside
the
powerhouse
unit.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
not
--
their
agreement
would
not
bind
the
--
would
not
either
exempt
them
from
unfair
labor
practice
judges
or
bind
them
--
or
bind
the
other
union
in
a
proceeding
before
the
court.
but
i
would
still
say
that
if
they
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
the
contract
question
as
between
themselves
that
then
there
is
an
obligation
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
can
enter
into
such
an
agreement
and
then
it
--
when
if
they
--
if
the
company
--
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
company
now
from
treating
these
people
as
if
they
were
in
the
iue
unit.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
problem
that
has
cribbled
you
come
to
realize,
but
there
are
great
many
other
more
vexing
problems
that
any
statural
would
immediately
create.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
may
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
accurate
to
say
there
is
a
clear
certification
here.
this
is
uncertain
and
the
employer
whichever
he
does
is
doing
--
he's
running
the
risk
of
violating
somebody's
right.
the
things
that
you
are
supposing
may
all
have
been
done
now.
in
fact,
the
iue
says
they
all
have
been
done
now.
if
the
company
is
violating
a
clear
certification,
disregarding
the
iue's
right
and
getting
together
with
the
federation,
the
other
union,
in
this
regard
of
the
act.
i
don't
say
it's
doing
that.
i
say
it
is
uncertain.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not.
i
think
the
court
has
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
uncertain.
i
kind
of
make
the
point
that
there
is
no
interference
with
the
board
policies
in
going
to
arbitration.
the
work
of
the
board,
the
essential
policies
of
the
act,
large
questions
in
freedom
of
choice,
elections
and
things
like
that
simply
aren't
involved
in
the
allocation
of
these
small
peripheral
groups
of
employees
and
it's
the
board's
conviction
as
expressed
in
the
brief
which
i
whole-heartedly
joined
that
having
this
disputes
go
to
arbitration
facilitates
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
i
turn
to
the
question
whether
there
is
unfairness
to
the
employer
or
a
possibility
of
utility
in
having
the
case
go
to
arbitration,
in
range
of
questions
that
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
have
been
suggesting.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
both,
but
the
board
you
will
observe
as
on
the
brief,
there's
no
--
i
don't
--
there
was
no
conscious
decision
mr.
justice
to
make
it
united
states
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
rather
than
the
board
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
question
at
all.
and
the
policy
views
--
are
the
policies
of
the
board.
there's
not
--
not
the
slightest,
they're
very
judicatory.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
effectuation
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
board
--
would
--
the
board
did
--
the
board's
lawyers
did
sign
and
therefore
i
take
it
that
they
concur
in
their
statement
that
the
chances
are
that
an
arbitrator
will
do
a
better
job
of
resolving
this
kind
of
question
than
the
board
will.
now,
after
all
this
--
this
is
a
matter
justice
brennan
as
i'm
--
as
i'm
sure
you'll
recall
of
getting
down
there
and
seeing
what
the
work
is,
what
the
relations
between
these
employees
and
the
flow
of
production
through
the
plaintiff.
arbitrators
with
job
classification
cases,
sobriety
cases,
work
assignment
cases
come
especially
where
there's
a
permanent
empire
or
a
big
company
like
westinghouse
to
be
very
close
to
these
things.
they
get
their
hands
dirty
with
them
from
time-to-time.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
--
well,
even
the
little
guys
get
arbitrative
for
quite
a
number
of
them.
once
arbitrated,
when
where
they
said,
“if
i
could
make
the
rate,
it
was
fair
and
if
i
couldn't
make
the
rate
out
of
piece
of
work
then
it
wouldn't
be
fair
and
i
was
put
to
work.”
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
but
the
--
the
people
who
do
it
still
do
this
sort
of
thing
over
and
over
again.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
more
of
it
then.
the
--
let
me
turn
if
i
may
to
the
claim
of
unfairness
to
the
employer.
the
argument
of
course
is
that
if
the
arbitrator
sustains
the
company's
position
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
he
sustains
the
union's
position
in
the
arbitration,
then
the
company
says,
“this
won't
bind
the
other
union.”
there's
a
chance
that
it
will
run
to
the
board
and
claim
that
there's
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
board
may
find
that
the
award
did
require
the
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
we
will
be
required
to
stop
bargaining
with
iue
and
possibly,
we
will
even
have
to
pay
back
pay.
that
possibility
is
inherent
in
the
situation
if
iue
wins,
i
take
it
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
a
lot
of
back
pay
so
that
--
that
unfortunately
is
hardly
inescapable
either
way.
now,
granted
that
arbitration
does
create
some
risks
prejudice
to
the
company
because
it
get
carries
no
guarantee
of
absolute
finality.
i
wanted
to
suggest
two
general
things.
first,
there
are
good,
many
considerations
that
tamper
that
risk,
also
they
don't
destroy
it.
and
second,
that
there
are
good
many
considerations
on
the
other
side
that
i
varied
to
a
moment
ago
that
would
make
an
extremely
unfortunate
to
create
this
kind
of
exception
to
the
role
of
the
smith
case.
the
temperate
considerations
are
these.
in
the
first
place,
one
can't
forget
that
the
company
did
unequivocally
promise
to
arbitrate
this.
if
they've
got
themselves
in
an
inconsistent
position,
they
are
a
little
bit
like
the
fellow
who
was
--
sold
his
house
twice.
again,
it
is
entirely
speculative
whether
the
rival
union
would
carry
the
case
to
the
board.
i
can't
say
it
wouldn't,
but
it
isn't
here,
wasn't
in
the
court
below.
if
an
arbitrary
award
--
went
against
it,
it
might
well
stop
there.
third,
even
so
the
arbitration
award
would
not
be
legally
binding
upon
the
rival
union,
it
would
undoubtedly
carry
the
weight
of
an
expert's
determination
in
the
board
proceeding.
he
would
have
been
a
man
on
the
spot,
and
i
do
urge
that
is
a
very
great
advantage
over
cold
record
in
washington
for
four
or
five
men
dealing
with
words.
fourth,
either
the
court
below
or
the
arbitrator
himself
might
offer
the
rival
union
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
be
heard
in
this
proceeding.
it's
even
conceivable
if
the
court
below
might
order
the
case
to
arbitration
only
if
the
rival
union
were
given
an
opportunity
to
come
in.
i
don't
say
it
would
do
that.
i
have
no
precedents
that
i
can
cite
but
it's
at
least
the
possibility.
fifth,
i
submit
most
urgently
that
experience
was
a
very
large
number
of
cases
both
in
the
railway
labor
world
and
in
industry
generally,
shows
that
this
kind
of
arbitration
does
result
in
a
goodly
proportion
of
the
cases
in
the
settlement
of
the
dispute,
even
though
both
unions
aren't
the
parties
to
it.
now
again,
it's
not
an
assurance.
i'm
just
talking
about
tempering
considerations.
and
finally
i
point
out,
there's
nothing
extraordinary
at
all
about
an
arbitrators
being
called
upon
the
to
decide
a
question
which
if
he
errs
may
result
in
his
requiring
the
company
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
violates
some
other
statute.
some
of
you
will
remember
that
immediately
after
the
(inaudible),
there
was
a
considerable
conflict
between
arbitrators
and
the
views
of
general
hershey
by
administering
the
selective
service
act
about
seniority.
the
unions
for
a
time,
took
the
position
that
the
returned
soldier
went
back
on
the
escalator
that
just
where
he
got
off.
he
got
credit
for
his
work
service.
but
if
layoffs
were
deepened
up
to
reach
his
service,
he
was
laid
off.
general
hershey
took
the
position
that
the
soldier
was
entitled
to
stay
on
the
payroll
as
long
as
there
was
anyone
there
for
a
year.
but
now,
arbitrators
have
to
decide
this
is
best
they
could
whenever
they
have
a
seniority
cases
settlement.
but,
they
have
to
make
similar
decisions
today
where
the
unions
demand
this
that
somebody
be
discharged
under
a
union
shop
clause
and
if
the
--
he
has
to
do
the
best
he
can,
there's
always
the
risk
that
sat
that
in
award
will
call
for
some
violation
of
the
surrounding
legal
structure.
if
arbitrations
to
go
forward,
that
is
inevitable
i
think,
inescapable.
now,
all
that
is
that
this
need
just
it
might
be,
it
involves
risks
of
duplication
of
inconsistency,
but
labor
relations
doesn't
always
flourish
under
the
tidiest
conceptual
formulas
and
a
more
tentative
process
something
that
gets
closer
to
the
practice
and
the
human
problems
often
is
the
more
effective.
against
any
remaining
unfairness
or
disadvantage
that
i
don't
think
it
can
be
talked
entirely
out
of
the
case,
i'm
greatly
exaggerated,
when
does
have
to
balance
the
affirmative
advantages
of
adhering
to
the
settled
policy
of
allowing
courts
and
especially
arbitrators
to
exercise
their
usual
jurisdiction
over
claims
for
breach
of
contract.
and
i
--
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
general
policy.
that's
clear
enough.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
advantages
of
arbitration
in
this
specific
kind
of
case
and
the
disadvantages
of
trying
to
draw
isn't
no
exception.
in
the
first
place
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
the
decision
can
be
made
in
arbitration
by
a
man
personally
familiar
with
the
flatwork.
it
can
be
made
far
more
quickly
and
in
expensively
than
in
a
board
proceeding,
to
hold
that
an
arbitrator
may
not
proceed
whenever
either
party
raises
a
question
of
representation,
would
fragment,
impede
and
delay
the
arbitration
of
grievances.
let
me
put
a
simple
example
to
illustrate
that
part.
suppose
that
a
company
in
the
time
of
layoffs,
lays
off
a
who's
worked
to
the
company
10
years
and
keeps
b
who
has
worked,
let's
say,
seven
years.
the
union
says
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
seniority
clause.
the
company
replies
that
though
a
had
a
break
in
his
seniority
so,
he
really
has
only
five
years
seniority.
in
addition,
a
can't
do
the
work
anyway
and
b
can
and
finally
throws
in
for
good
measure
without
putting
any
real
stock
in
it.
anyway,
a
is
a
supervisor
and
he's
not
within
the
bargaining
unit.
now,
this
would
mean
under
the
respondent's
view,
the
whole
arbitration
has
got
to
seize,
that
everybody
has
got
to
wait
until
the
matter
goes
to
the
board
to
find
out
whether
a
is
or
isn't
outside
the
bargaining
unit,
whereas,
if
it
could
go
to
arbitration,
the
whole
thing
will
be
decided
then
and
there.
in
other
words,
that
up
--
opens
opportunities
for
delay
at
best
for
stalling
at
words.
again,
i
think
the
respondents
will
--
would
introduce
horribly
confusing
distinctions.
in
many
cases
justice
brennan,
the
unit
is
not
defined
by
a
certification
as
you
know
but
is
defined
by
contract
between
the
parties.
now,
what
would
we
to
say?
that
whenever
the
unit
is
defined
by
contract,
it
can
--
the
case
can
go
to
arbitration,
the
alternative
to
that
is
to
say
that
whenever
a
company
agrees
voluntarily
to
setup
a
bargaining
unit,
it
has
the
right
to
back
out
whenever
it
sees
fit
and
get
a
board
determination.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
even
--
even
that
won't
do
altogether
because
it
frequently
happens
that
the
original
unit
will
be
defined
by
the
board
and
then
additional
groups
are
added
by
contract,
frequently
were
accepted.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
unless
that
union
--
not
unless
that
union
that
had
gone
out
of
existence.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
if
we
may,
would
probably
do
but
we
don't
know
for
sure
but
then
i
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suggest
they
could
go
to
an
award.
i
should
suppose
that
a
court
in
deciding
whether
to
enforce
it,
would
at
least
to
some
extent,
consider
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
i
should
doubt
that
it
would
go
back
in
the
question
to
fact.
i
would
think
that
it
would
leave
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
question
to
be
tried
out
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
the
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
if
the
order
said
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
some
many
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
think
that
a
court
would
make
an
order
directing
them
to
do
it
and
that
the
opposing
union's
remedy
would
be
to
go
before
the
board.
and
the
board
orders
subsequently,
directing
it
to
bargain
with
it
if
it
entered
one,
would
of
course
control
over
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
problems
you'd
now
mentioned
that
so
far
as
i
see
arise.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
no
question
on
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
to
call
over
any
inconsistent
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but,
the
court
--
if
the
board
has
made
an
order
to
bargain
with
the
federation,
the
other
union,
the
court
would
not
order
the
employer
to
disregard
the
board's
command
that
would
take
proceedings.
but
until
the
board
has
made
such
a
command,
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
open
for
the
arbitration
matter
to
go
ahead
in
accordance
with
the
contract
that
everybody
promised.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
--
i
would
have
to
quarrel
with
your
honor's
statement.
i
don't
think
when
sees
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
one
saw
in
advance
that
the
order
would
require
the
company
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
nevertheless
you
would
go
to
arbitration
and
make
such
an
order.
it's
uncertain
what
the
order
will
be.
it's
uncertain
what
the
labor
board
would
hold.
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
obstruction,
an
interference
with
the
normal
processes
of
industrial
relation
for
somebody
to
come
in
and
say
there's
one
chance
in
50,
maybe
one
in
100
or
one
in
two,
that
this
will
result
in
an
order
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
chance
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
award
tells
him
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
the
court
can't
know
what
the
board
would
decide
unless
it
uses
words
that
tell
him
to
do
something
that
is
an
unfair
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
if
the
order
tells
him
to
coerce
employees
in
the
choice
of
their
union
under
such
circumstances
that
that
would
be
clearly
an
unfair
labor
practice
then
the
court
should
not
have
to
enforce
it
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
suggest
justice
black,
is
that
here,
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
not,
none
at
all
literally,
that
what
the
arbitrator's
decision
either
way
would
require
the
company
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
you
don't
know
that
complying
with
the
award
involves
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
may
not
involve
an
unfair
labor
practice.
because
the
union
maybe
entirely
right
that
there's
no
--
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
involves
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
basically
it
is
the
same.
there
are
--
i
have
to
confess
certain
differences.
one
difference
that
pressed
is
that
this
is
a
representation
case,
and
those
involved
unfair
labor
practice.
i
was
--
it's
speaking
about
the
character
of
the
--
who
can
decide
this
best.
i
was
really
addressing
myself
to
that.
now,
the
other
difference
is
that
in
the
smith
case
and
in
most
to
the
cases
that
one
thinks
about
in
connection
with
the
smith
problem,
the
board
would
treat
the
arbitration
award
as
binding.
here,
i
am
confident
that
it
would
give
it
weight
if
the
federation
were
given
a
chance
to
come
in
and
didn't,
i'm
confident
that
it
would
regarded
practically
as
controlling
and
that
might
happen.
but
i
cannot
say
in
all
honesty
that
the
board
would
hold
it
as
binding
on
the
federation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
of
course
it
does
seem
to
me
that
anybody
can
say
on
these
facts
that
it
does
look
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
one
can
imagine
one
but
the
cases
that
come
up
where
the
ones
on
these
--
on
these
facts.
and
the
other
point
that
i
would
suggest
that
this
has
in
common
with
the
smith
problem
that
i
would
have
devoted
time
to
--
if
i
have
to
spend
so
much
time
on
question
is
that
this
case,
well
i
think
in
all
fairness,
it
has
to
do
with
a
question
of
representation,
is
as
a
practical
matter,
indistinguishable
from
the
work
assignment
problem.
and
if
there
is
anything
that
is
clear
about
this
case,
it
is
that
the
company
is
altogether
wrong
in
saying
that
work
assignment
problems
can
be
settled
between
two
unions
under
section
9.
indeed,
it's
that
more
than
anything
else
that
led
me
to
be
here
because
that
would
upset
more
other
important
enter
union
arrangements,
and
board
distinction
worked
out
that
--
argues
than
--
than
almost
any
other
case
of
this
kind.
and
my
point
is
i
don't
think
those
cases
hand
in
the
practical
day-to-day
working
out.
they
made
to
be
held
up
while
somebody
decides,
is
this
a
representation
dispute
or
is
this
work
assignment
dispute.
they've
been
going
to
arbitrators
for
years.
they
have
a
great
bulk
of
them
that
satisfactorily
resolved
over
that
period
and
it's
our
view
that
the
arbitrators
should
be
permitted
to
continue.
