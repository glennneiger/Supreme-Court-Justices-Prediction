justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that
--
do
i
understand
you
saying
that
when
you
see
in
advance,
submitting
to
arbitration
will
bring
about
an
order
against
the
company
or
union,
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
they
have
to
wait
until
this
arbitration
occurs
and
then
go
to
the
labor
board
in
connection
with
it,
if
not,
if
that's
true,
i
wouldn't
be
better
to
go
there
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
not
have
understood
what
you
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
do
order
him
to
try
the
court,
it
his
people
say
he's
got
to
do
that
under
the
arbitration
of
the
board
that,
would
the
court
have
to
inform
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
use
those
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
my
words
were,
tell
him
that
he's
got
to
go
and
compel
these
people
not
to
join
this
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
question
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
not
production
and
maintenance
workers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
not
production
and
maintenance
workers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
who
else
is?
then
what
would
they
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
contract
would
they
be
under?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
contract
would
they
be
under?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
a
different
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
you
have
it
seems
to
me,
i
am
asking
what
i'd
like
to
say,
what
you
have
here
is
dispute
between
two
unions
as
to
whether
certain
workers
come
under
the
contract
of
their
union,
each
of
those
unions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
arbitrators
bind
the
other
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
settle
the
dispute,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
settle
the
dispute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
plain
order
in
everyday
jurisdictional
dispute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
union
claims
that
they
ought
to
be
on
its
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
their
private
opinion
in
this
arbitration
because
they
haven't.
they
have
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
wouldn't
the
arbitrators
get
through
and
finished,
and
when
still
be
left,
question
which
had
to
be
decided
by
somebody
as
to
which
one
of
these
units,
we
call
it
units,
i
guess,
unions,
these
people
who
are
entitled
work
under
their
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
might
never
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
he
decides
that
there
is
though?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
usually,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
effect
would
the
arbitration
have
if
it
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
have
any
effect;
the
arbitration--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
might
influence
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it
here,
they
agreed
to
arbitrate
anything
whether
their
arbitration
accept
it
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
even
if
there's
still
that
same
old
perplexing
problem
left
for
the
board
or
as
court
as
somebody
else
to
decide
--
