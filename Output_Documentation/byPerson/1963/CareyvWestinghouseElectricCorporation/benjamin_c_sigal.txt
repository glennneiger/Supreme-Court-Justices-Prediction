mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
a
suit
to
compel
arbitration
of
a
grievance
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york
refused
to
compel
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
matter.
the
material
facts
of
the
case
are
simple.
as
a
result
of
an
n.l.r.b.
election,
the
petitioner
was
certified
as
the
bargaining
representative
for
a
unit
of
production
and
maintenance
of
employees
at
the
respondents
baltimore
works.
on
--
pursuant
--
after
having
a
national
agreement
was
executed
between
the
party
and
the
respondent
agreed
to
recognize
the
petitioner
on
behalf
of
and
in
conjuncture
with
this
local
130
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
these
employees
among
others.
the
national
agreement
provide
among
other
things
for
arbitration
of
grievances
which
involve
the
interpretation,
application
and
--
or
claim
violation
of
the
agreement.
on
march
5th,
1958,
the
petitioner
filed
a
grievance
protesting
the
respondent's
refusal
to
apply
the
agreement
to
the
performance
of
certain
work
which
has
been
assigned
to
employees
who
were
in
the
engineering
laboratory
of
the
respondent
outside
of
the
unit
of
--
of
the
petitioner
but
in
the
same
plant.
the
union
can
tender
that
the
work
was
production
and
maintenance
work
and
that
the
assignment
of
this
work
outside
the
bargaining
unit
was
a
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
--
and
the
assignment
that
to
this
engineering
laboratory
which
was
in
a
bargaining
unit
represented
by
another
union,
the
federation
as
so-called,
which
represented
the
salary
technical,
clerical
and
professional
employees
but
excluding
the
production
and
maintenance
workers
and
they
had
an
agreement
for
recognition
on
this
basis.
so,
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
units
of
either
of
the
unions,
no
conflicts
in
the
agreement
of
recognition.
now,
in
support
of
its
grievance,
the
petitioner
contended
that
the
respondent
had
moved
production
and
maintenance
work
to
the
engineering
laboratory
as
well
as
employees
from
the
petitioner's
unit
into
this
laboratory
and
had
thereby
violated
the
agreement.
when
the
company
rejected
the
union's
grievance,
the
union
requested
arbitration
and
sought
enforcement
of
its
--
and
when
--
and
the
company
rejected
it,
thereupon
the
union
sought
enforcement
in
the
new
york
state
court.
during
this
entire
period,
from
the
beginning
to
the
filing
of
the
grievance
to
the
very
end,
the
federation
did
not
events
any
interest
whatsoever
in
this
dispute.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
any
interest
on
the
part
of
the
federation.
now,
although
filed
in
a
state
court
is
of
course
clear
that
there's
no
question
that
the
outcome
of
this
suit
is
governed
by
the
federal
law
applicable
to
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
pursuant
to
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
now,
the
respondent's
resistance
to
arbitration
is
not
based
on
a
clean
limitation
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
it
rather
contends
that
the
matter
to
be
arbitrated
falls
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
at
the
outset,
we
pleaded
as
clear
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
an
error.
the
court
there
relied
on
the
marine
engineer
beneficial
association
decision
which
holds
that
in
the
relation
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
the
state
court
injunction
is
preempted
whenever
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute
is
arguably
within
the
area
which
congress
regulated
in
the
labor
management
relations
act.
however,
the
line
of
decisions
in
smith
versus
evening
news
association
by
which
this
is
--
this
case
is
a
part,
make
it
clear
that
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
this
federally
created
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
the
federally
created
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
under
section
301
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
entirely
a
different
question
from
the
one
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
marine
engineer
beneficial
association.
in
the
former
line
of
cases
that
is
in
the
smith
line
of
cases,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
is
not
displaced
by
section
301
and
neither
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
under
section
301
displaced
by
that
of
the
board.
i
don't
wish
to
dwell
further
really
on
this
question
so
far
because
it
appears
to
us
that
the
respondent
does
not
really
contend
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
correct.
but
may
we
just
--
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
45,
the
respondent
asserts
fully
whether
or
not
strictly
speaking,
the
result
below
should
be
expressed
in
terms
of
preemption.
the
preemption
cases
provide
a
forceful
analogy
of
--
supporting
affirmance
without
reliance
on
any
doctrine,
there
were
doctrine
enclosed.
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
overall
scheme
of
the
act
requires
that
the
instant
dispute
be
resolved
by
the
n.l.r.b.
to
the
exclusion
of
an
arbitrator
under
the
iue
agreement.
now,
the
respondents
and
of
course
this
argument,
asserts
that
this
case
falls
within
the
exception
suggested
in
smith
that
this
is
--
that
this
is
a
serious
problem
which
was
not
dealt
within
the
smith
and
that
there
is
no
fair
and
orderly
solution
available
otherwise
and
through
the
n.l.r.b.
and
this
is
a
serious
problem
which
must
now
be
resolved.
now,
in
smith,
the
court
--
this
court
rejected
the
--
as
a
general
matter,
the
contention
of
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
n.l.r.b.
under
sections
8,
9
and
10
of
the
act
with
that
of
course
under
section
301,
precludes
enforcement
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
respect
to
matters
which
give
rise
to
the
overlapping
jurisdiction.
now,
the
court
also
stated
there
that
if
there
are
situations
in
which
serious
problems
might
arise
out
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
acts
which
are
mount
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
the
courts
will
--
the
court
will
face
those
problems
when
they
arise.
but
the
court
did
not
find
such
a
problem
to
exist
in
smith
and
we
submit
there
is
no
such
problem
here.
and
just
recently,
the
--
this
court
of
appeals,
the
second
circuit
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here,
likewise
found
there
was
no
such
serious
problem
as
the
court
suggested
in
smith
and
resolved
the
matter
in
favor
of
enforcing
the
arbitration
agreement,
that
case
is
now
pending
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
now
here,
unlike
smith,
the
court
is
not
asked
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
contract
grievance
and
enter
a
final
judgment
of
it.
all
we
have
here
is
the
question
of
enforcement
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
the
grievance
and
that
therefore,
there
are
even
less
possibility
of
any
serious
problem
than
there
was
in
smith.
the
precise
scope
of
such
problem
as
may
arise
will
only
be
known
after
the
arbitration
when
the
nature
of
the
grievance
will
be
precisely
known,
when
the
fact
will
be
determined,
when
the
merits
of
the
dispute
had
been
established
and
the
remedy
chosen
by
the
arbitrator
has
been
stated
and
given.
no
problems
arise
from
the
mere
fact
of
ordering
arbitration.
should
the
union
lose
its
grievance
that
would
dispel
all
the
specters
which
have
been
suggested?
if
the
union
wins
the
arbitration,
it
is
not
possible
to
state
now
that
there
will
be
any
serious
problem.
the
resolution
which
the
arbitrator
might
determine
upon
might
be
satisfactory
to
all
parties
and
there
will
be
no
further
problem.
now,
this
court
had
occasion
to
deal
with
a
case
very
closely
resembling
the
one
here
in
the
white
--
whitehouse
versus
illinois
central
railway
company.
now,
that
was
--
and
arose
under
the
--
rail
national
--
the
railway
labor
act
and
also
concerned
a
two-union
work
assignment
dispute.
one
union
took
the
case
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
which
refused
the
request
of
the
employer
that
the
other
union
be
notified
that
it
had
a
right
to
participate
in
the
case.
the
employers
if
there
would
be
serious
problems
of
that
union
were
not
present
or
not
participating
in
the
proceeding.
this
court
there
held
that
the
injuries
feared
by
the
employer
were
too
speculative
to
warrant
judicial
relief
because
an
award
it
said,
â€œboth
maybe
rendered
which
could
occasion
no
possible
injury
to
it."
now,
while
the
problems
arising
out
of
the
enforcements
of
the
arbitration
agreement
are
entirely
speculative.
the
harms
that
would
flow
from
the
denial
of
arbitration
in
this
case
are
very
concrete
and
substantial.
contrary
to
the
company's
assertion,
no
relief
can
be
obtained
by
the
petitioner
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
the
violation
of
its
contract.
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
such.
this
grievance
may
go
far
beyond
the
matter
of
the
question
of
the
work
assignment
or
--
or
representation.
they
are
in
this
case
serious
problems
of
seniority
involved.
now,
if
in
--
the
respondent
asserts
this
is
a
representation
matter
which
it
should
go
to
the
board.
now,
we're
--
it
cannot
be
set
at
the
outset,
the
board
would
even
take
it
if
a
petition
for
clarification
were
submitted,
the
board
might
decide
this
isn't
the
case
for
clarification.
now
let
us
assume
the
--
a
representation
petition
were
filed,
where
in
this
case
even
though
there's
great
doubt
that
it
would
be
accepted
because
of
a
contract
bar.
the
result
--
the
board
--
the
board
would
presume
the
correctness
of
the
work
assignment
by
the
employer,
that
is
not
one
of
the
criteria
used
by
the
board
in
determining
the
appropriate
bargaining
--
bargaining
unit.
the
board
will
decide
the
question
solely
on
the
principles
that
has
established
for
the
--
determining
the
proper
--
the
composition
of
bargaining
units
and
not
on
the
basis
of
the
petitioner's
contract
right.
thus,
assuming
the
board
could
petition
the
--
the
petitioner
could
go
to
the
board,
the
--
such
a
proceeding
would
not
be
equivalent
to
the
enforcement
of
the
petitioner's
collective
bargaining
agreement
through
arbitration
and
certainly
could
not
dispose
of
all
of
the
matters
which
had
been
raised
by
the
grievance.
if
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
not
a
representation
dispute
but
it
is
a
work
assignment
dispute
as
the
petitioner
believed.
any
authority
of
the
board
to
resolve
this
matter
would
be
dependent
on
section
10
(k),
flowing
from
the
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
act.
the
board's
authority
to
determine
work
assignment
disputes
under
section
10
(k),
comes
into
play
only
when
the
--
when
the
union
unlawfully
engages
in
a
strike
or
a
threat
of
a
strike
and
then
a
charge
is
filed
against
it.
only
then
may
the
board
take
up
the
question
of
the
work
assignment
and
resolve
it
to
the
extent
that
it
can.
now,
it
appears
to
us
that
certainly
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
an
actual
or
a
threatened
obstruction
of
commerce
a
condition
precedent
to
the
availability
of
a
forum
for
the
resolution
of
such
a
dispute.
now,
furthermore,
in
violating
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
if
the
petitioner
were
to
determine
upon
that,
the
union
would
subject
itself
to
damages
for
violation
of
its
--
under
section
303
of
the
act.
a
grant
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
to
hoard
tort
damages
for
conduct
which
is
also
an
unfair
labor
practice,
further
confirms
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
established
under
section
--
entitled
3
of
the
act,
was
to
be
ousted
by
the
authority
given
to
the
board
under
section
10
(k),
from
title
1.
and
this
of
course
decides
in
the
fact
that
that
--
that
authority
couldn't
be
exercised
to
resolve
a
contract
right
of
the
petitioner.
now,
i've
mentioned
that
this
might
be
either
a
representation
dispute
or
work
assignment
dispute.
there
are
some
difference
between
the
parties
as
to
what
it
is,
but
the
parties
are
agreeing,
however,
that
is
immaterial
that
the
result
of
this
case
whether
is
a
--
a
one
or
the
other.
now,
the
denial
of
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
agreement
in
this
case
or
at
any
case
would
mean
that
whatever
that
party
asserts
a
grievance
which
raises
a
question
which
arguably
falls
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
n.l.r.b.
,
it
will
find
that
it
has
no
remedy
for
the
enforcement
of
its
contract.
and
i
submit
that
most
grievances
can
in
one
flash
or
another,
arguably
be
shown
to
the
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
now,
such
a
holding
would
certainly
invite
parties
--
reluctant
parties
to
arbitration
agreements
to
raise
--
to
refuse
arbitration
and
the
hope
that
they
could
flash
in
a
matter
somehow
into
a
question
which
falls
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
and
this,
i
submit
would
create
a
burden
on
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
arbitration
agreements
comparable
to
what
the
--
this
court
found,
the
american
manufacturing
case
and
this
would
certainly
be
a
very
highly
crippling
influence
or
factor
on
arbitration
matters.
now,
the
respondent
lay
stress
on
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
it
maybe
confronted
with
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
impromptu
agreements,
covering
the
same
matter
and
therefore,
it
might
be
confronted
with
inconsistence
of
warrants
with
one
of
which
should
--
could
not
comply.
now,
the
sure
answer
to
that
contention
is
that
this
is
at
this
point
highly
speculated.
furthermore,
this
asserted
dilemma
falls
outside
the
scope
of
the
preemption
cases.
to
the
extent
that
such
a
problem
may
arise
in
the
future,
it
is
certainly
not
in
our
view
that
be
resolved
by
weighing
the
congressional
intent
as
to
the
balance
of
any
could
be
struck
by
between
section
301
and
section
10
(k)
of
the
act.
respondent's
remedy
to
bar
enforcement
of
arbitration
does
not
resolve
the
conflict
but
would
force
both
unions
to
accept
the
respondent's
determination
of
its
own
--
of
its
obligations
as
final.
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
other
union
has
any
interest
in
this
matter.
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
two
unions
so
far
as
this
record
reflects.
the
respondent
would
have
the
court
believe
that
there
is
such
a
dispute
and
that
the
employer
is
just
an
impartial
neutral.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
dispute
didn't
arise
until
after
both
agreements
were
executed
and
arose
by
the
unilateral
act
of
the
employer
in
making
the
changes
in
these
transfers
of
employees
and
changes
of
work
assignment.
this
is
a
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
the
employer
and
it
falls
within
an
area
which
--
matters
which
are
the
critical
issues
in
bargaining
at
this
time.
the
real
question's
relating
to
the
performance
of
new
work,
the
consequences
of
technological
change,
the
introduction
of
new
processes
and
equipment
and
the
effect
of
the
--
and
the
impact
of
the
relocation
of
plants,
these
are
all
matters
which
are
of
vital
importance
in
bargaining
today
and
they
are
vital
importance
in
the
administration
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
these
are
the
grist
in
--
of
the
grievance
mill,
frequently
they
involved
erosions
of
the
bargaining
units.
they
are
highly
inflammable
issues
and
they
should
be
disposed
off
expeditiously,
and
the
parties
have
agreed
on
a
procedure
for
disposing
of
these
matters
of
another
contract
violations
expeditiously.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
government.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
no.
our
position
is
that
on
the
fact,
this
is
closer
to
our
work
assignment
dispute
into
a
representation
dispute,
but
we
don't
deny
that
this
is
a
difficult
area.
it's
difficult
to
decide
frequently
whether
it's
one
or
the
other
but
we
have
said
it
makes
no
difference.
we
say
at
the
work
assignment
dispute
because
the
work
was
taken
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
unit
represented
by
the
petitioner
and
transferred
to
the
unit
represented
by
this
--
the
other
union,
and
employees
that
were
in
the
unit
of
the
petitioner
were
taken
out
and
put
in
the
unit
of
the
other
union.
now,
we
say
this
has
most
of
the
indicia
of
a
work
assignment
dispute
but
we
say
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
one
or
the
other.
the
government
has
argued
both
questions,
and
the
respondent
has
specifically
stated
that
it
makes
no
difference.
i
call
your
attention
to
--
i
think
at
page
13
of
the
respondent's
brief
or
specifically
a
search
that
under
either
of
those
characterizations
that
has
work
assignment
dispute
or
representation
dispute
or
any
other
characterization,
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
grievance
as
such
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed,
so
that
none
of
the
parties
here
as
really
--
a
critical
rise
on
that
place
--
on
a
difference.
now,
in
our
view
that,
if
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
affirmed,
it
will
unsettle
countless
collective
bargaining
relationship
which
seriously
interfere
with
the
expeditious
settlement
of
disputes
by
the
machinery
contemplated
by
the
parties.
and
what
emasculate
section
301
of
the
act
insofar
as
that
act
makes
--
that
section
makes
possible
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements.
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
--
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
speculation
about
what
the
end
product
of
a
number
of
postulated
alternatives
maybe
and
i'm
afraid
the
facts
in
this
case
have
been
lost
in
this
cloud
of
speculation.
now
it
has
been
assumed
that
this
is
a
representation
case
in
which
the
union
is
seeking
to
its
largest
unit
that
is
not
the
fact
and
it
is
not
in
our
view
of
representation
case
in
any
respect,
but
let
us
recall
your
attention,
your
honors,
to
the
statements
of
the
issue
as
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
the
petitioner
at
page
36
of
the
record.
now
there
it
is
pointed
out
and
nowhere
denied
in
the
answering
affidavit
of
the
company
that
what
happened
here
was
that
after
the
contract,
after
the
certification,
after
the
contract
was
signed,
the
company
for
the
first
time
moved
the
work,
moved
production
and
maintenance
work
out
of
the
unit
represented
by
the
petitioner
into
the
engineering
laboratory
and
it
is
also
asserted
that
they
moved
employees
represented
by
the
petitioner
over
into
the
engineering
laboratory.
so
you
have
here
asserted
and
nowhere
denied
in
the
answering
affidavits
that
there
was
a
transfer
of
work,
there
was
a
work
assignment
which
was
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
the
agreement,
that
is
nowhere
denied
so
that
must
be
considered
to
be
the
fact.
therefore,
there
is,
as
we
see
it,
unquestionably
a
work
assignment
dispute
here
and
there
may
or
may
not
be
some
questions
as
to
whether
the
employees,
who
were
transferred,
were
actually
production
and
maintenance
workers.
now
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
units.
the
record
is
clear.
the
unit
represented
by
the
petitioner
is
the
production
and
maintenance
unit
excluding
salaried,
clerical
and
technical
employees.
the
unit
represented
by
the
federation
as
the
salaried
technical
and
clerical
employees
excluding
all
production
and
maintenance
workers.
so
all
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
employees
a,
b,
c,
and
d
are
production
and
maintenance
workers.
there
is
no
question
of
the
unit.
the
unit
has
been
determined
and
nobody
is
seemed
to
be
changing
the
unit.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
am
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
they
are
not
production
and
maintenance
workers,
then
the
grievance
falls.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh,
they
maybe
technicians,
they
maybe
engineers,
they
maybe
something
other
than
production.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
am
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they
would
be
presumably
represented
by
the
federation
because
they
are
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
a
different
union.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but,
your
honor,
this
doesn't
flow
from
any
question
or
doubt
as
to
what
the
certification
is;
it's
only
a
question
with
respect
to
whether
the
specific
employees
do
certain
work.
your
honor,
it's
just
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
the
arbitrator
would
not
bind
the
other
union
if
it
wasn't
the
party,
but
the
point
is,
so
far
as
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
pardon?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
may
settle
it.
if
the
arbitrator
says
you
have
no
grievance
that
settles
it.
that
settles
it.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
an
ordinary
jurisdictional
dispute
because
in
our
view,
there
is
no
question
about
the
--
in
this
situation,
we
have
a
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
company.
now
let
us
assume
that
there
is
a
jurisdiction
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
other
union
in
this
case
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
in
this
case,
the
other
union
hasn't
claimed
anything;
they
have
been
silent,
and
we
do
not
know,
and
we
cannot
speculate,
we
should
not
speculate
that
the
answer
of
the
arbitrator
would
be
improper
or
would
violate
the
law
or
would
extend
the
unit.
these
things
are
speculated,
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
confidence
of
arbitrators
in
labor
disputes.
for
example,
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
case,
when
it
advised
to
board
to
go
to
arbitrators
to
learn
how
work
assignment
disputes
are
disposed
off.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
that's
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor,
there
might
be
no
question.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
the
arbitrator
might
decide
that
there
is
no
valid
grievance
and
dismiss
the
grievance.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
he
decides
that
the
employee
should
be
transferred,
well,
now
in
that
case,
if
the
arbitrator
decides
that
the
work
should
be
transferred,
then
if
this
is
not
acceptable
to
the
other
union
and
it
may
well
be
acceptable,
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
we
don't
know
that
as
per
to
the
merits
of
this
grievance,
we're
not
supposed
to
enter
into
the
merits
of
the
grievance,
your
honor,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
at
this
stage,
the
undenied
assertion
of
the
petitioner
should
be
accepted.
now
in
the
event
that
the
employer
can
in
some
fashion
create
an
unfair
labor
practice
out
of
this,
then
anxiously
the
other
union
does
object,
it
can,
of
course,
file
a
charge.
now,
the
fact
that
there
is
this
outside
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
then
the
board
would
consider
it,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
it
might
have
a
substantial
effect
â€“
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
insofar
as
the
board's
own
action
is
concerned.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
of
course,
and
this
is
what
the
parties
agreed
upon.
they
agreed
upon
the
procedure
to
have
an
arbitrator
decide
these
issues
for
them,
all
the
issues.
there
is
no
exception
in
this
agreement,
your
honor.
so
far
as
this
problem
is
concerned,
it's
an
unqualified
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
there
was
any
limitation
on
that
right
to
arbitrate
including
that
section
on
repetition.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
absolutely.
even
if
it
wouldn't
settle
it
that's
what
they
agreed
upon.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
don't
know
that
that
problem
would
exist,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
what
the
company
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
to
do
is
to
emasculate
the
whole
line
of
decisions
of
the
steel
workers
trilogy
and
all
our
cases
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
the
employee
of
the
union
to
bargain
its
opportunities
under
section
7
to
bargain.
if
we
set
aside
the
ryan
retail
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
it
would
not
â€“
that
section
9
does
not
quantify
section
301.
it
would
set
aside
the
arkansas
(inaudible)
case
in
which
the
court
said
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
to
the
board
to
get
certification
that
the
parties
can
agree
themselves
on
the
certification.
and
in
that
respect,
the
respondent's
case
is
even
weaker
than
in
the
case
as
unfair
labor
practice
because
only
the
board
can
decide
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
occurred,
but
the
parties
under
section
9
can
themselves
determine
what
the
union
is
and
the
board
will
accept
the
party's
determination
even
if
that
determination
nullifies
the
board's
own
decertification.
thank
you.
