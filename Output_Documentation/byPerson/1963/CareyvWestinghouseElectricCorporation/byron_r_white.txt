justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
really
a
question
of
what
the
board
meant
in
the
certification
here?
is
it
--
is
there
--
is
there
any
real
doubt
about
what
--
what
the
unit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
they're
engineers
or
whatever
they
--
whatever
the
exclusion
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you're
--
you're
arguing
for
this
result
only
on
the
assumption
that
there's
some
doubt
and
ambiguity
in
the
labor
board's
certification,
you
wouldn't
make
the
same
argument
as
--
what's
absolutely
clear
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
represented
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
--
you're
just
suggesting
the
employer
may
--
may
--
in
the
face
of
a
clear
certification
by
the
board
disregarded
and
agree
otherwise
as
one
of
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
--
you
and
suggest
that
if
the
other
union
did
take
the
company
to
the
board
and
the
board
found
that
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
that
would
control
over
the
arbitrator
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
meanwhile.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
what
if
the
union
doesn't
agree
with
the
board
of
course
and
if
it
goes
in
the
court
once
the
arbitrator's
award
for
it
anyways,
so
what
does
a
court
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
don't
we
have
these
same
problems
under
smith
anyway
or
other
areas,
don't
we
have
it
precisely
the
same
--
these
same
problems
assuming
that
the
--
assuming
that
the
question
dismisses
an
arbitrable
and
the
question,
is
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
base
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
contract,
which
is
right
on
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
especially,
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
--
looks
like
it's
contrary
to
its
own
outstanding
order,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
these
facts
the
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
might
you
have
taken
this
for
the
board
mr.
hunt?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there's
no
necessity
from
interfere
as
yet
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
the
board
with
any
in
a
situation
like
this
would
defer
and
see
what
they're
arbitrating?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
take
it
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
the
arbitrator
decided
it,
that
you
could
go
to
the
board
--
that
--
and
you
--
you
would
free
to
go
to
the
board
and
have
them
decided
differently
or
--
or
at
least
try
to
get
the
board
to
decide
it
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
this
outcome
violating
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
the
major
of
the
burden
on
you
simply
if
you
want
to
avoid
arbitration
and
go
to
the
board
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
is
--
i'm
just
to
ask
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
isn't
this
really
the
major
burden
of
--
if
--
if
--
that
your
choice
is
either
arbitrative,
go
to
the
board?
now,
you
could
--
you
avoid,
you
say,
he
would
be
here
today
if
you
did
not
go
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
this
really
the
major
of
the
burden
which
the
suggested
rule
is
holding
--
which
the
board's
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
--
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
--
you've
said
that
the
smith
were
rational,
this
one
of
the
cases
where
serious
problems
created.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think,
are
no
more
serious
than
it
is
serious
to
require
either
you
or
mr.
sigal
will
go
to
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
they
say
that
they
don't
see
why
they
should
have
to
go
the
board
and
when
you
promise
to
arbitrate,
is
that
this
kind
of
a
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
think
they
can
get
from
the
arbitrators?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
301
(inaudible)
arbitration
is
kind
of
dispute.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
certification
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hunt,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
you
couldn't
have
a
three-quartered
agreement
in
a
private
resolution
of
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
that
your
collective
bargaining
agreement
explicitly
excluded
these
kinds
of
disputes,
from
your
obligation
to
arbitrate.
now
this
problem
comes
up
and
then
you
and
the
two
unions
get
together
and
you
have
a
private
resolution
of
the
matter,
agree
to
how
to
dispose
this
case,
it
happens
to
vary
from
the
unit,
the
resulting
units
happen
to
vary
from
those
certified
by
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
no
question
then,
and
if
you
resolve
this
matter
that
it
would
be
an
enforceable
arrangement,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
go
to
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
similarly,
assume
your
contract
specifically
excluded
this
kind
of
a
dispute
from
your
obligation
to
arbitrate,
and
the
same
situation
comes
up
and
these
are
same
union
asked
you
to
submit
it
to
an
arbitration,
and
you
might
think
that
well,
i'll
arbitrate,
i
suppose
you
could
do
it,
you'd
still
be
subject
to
be
taken
to
the
board
by
the
other
union.
now
you
apparently
disagree
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
apparently
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
arbitration
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
is
usually
successful
in
producing
some
kind
of
an
agreement
from
the
other
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
take
the
approach
that
assuming
that
the
arbitration
doesn't
bind
anybody
that
anybody
can
go
to
the
board
and
have
the
board's
final
say,
you
can
still
think
that
going
through
the
procedure
that
is
catalyst
to
try
that
resolution
of
the
matter
and
just
avoid
all
official
--
which
is
the
solicitor
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
circular,
this
means
that
your
only
answer
is
that
you
eventually
get
to
the
board
anyway,
if
somebody
wants
to
welsh,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
many
times
the
people
welsh
when
all
three
people
had
a
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
there
is
any
chance
that
the
board
acting
on
an
arbitrator's
decision
on
that
question
like
this
would
refuse
to
entertain?
justice
byron
r.
white
different
from
an
unfairly
practical
situation?
