justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
would
you
make
in
this
argument
that
this
group
were
represented
by
another
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
with
the
protest
of
others?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
protested
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
suggest
so,
that
would
be
immaterial
and
i
think
it
--
the
employer
in
this
union
could
by
agreement
without
arbitration,
resolve
risking
to
prove
these
people
even
though
the
protest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
well,
if
--
if
the
result
will
require
to
the
board
remedy,
i
take
it
all
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
oppose
this
litigation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor,
(inaudible)
this
can
be
resolved
by
definition
of
the
unit
and
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
(inaudible)
where
these
kind
of
problems
that
helped
the
union
before
a
consideration
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
that
the
policy
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
in
fact
is
the
work
(inaudible)
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
they've
obtained
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
can
see
this
difference
that
if
there's
been
a
contested
determination
of
the
unit,
it
might
be
rather
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
appreciate
that.
can
additional
groups
be
added
by
contract
when
some
other
union
already
represents
an
additional
group
perhaps
itself
where
the
board
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
in
fact
what
we
felt
we
have
some
aspect
to
that
problem
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
you're
--
you're
suggesting
are
you?
that
this
is
an
arbitration
which
results
in
a
determination
requiring
westinghouse
to
do
something
which
may
in
fact
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
this
nevertheless
is
an
enforceable
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
cases
mr.
solicitor,
they
could
go
back
on
the
front
--
behind
the
fact,
that
is
if
the
arbitrator's
examination,
assuming
you
don't
have
(inaudible)
what
does
bother
me
is
though
as
the
westinghouse
says,
“well,
i
can't
do
this.
if
i
obey
this,
i'm
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice.”
everyone
agrees
that
they
are.
nevertheless,
may
this
union
go
back
to
the
court
and
say,
that's
immaterial,
we
want
an
order
and
upon
westinghouse
officials
to
comply
with
this
award
or
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
all
it
says
is
comply
with
the
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
again,
may
i
comeback
to
the
question
i
ask
you
originally?
if
--
if
the
alternative
--
rather
is
that
this
kind
of
thing
has
to
go
to
the
board,
the
problems
that
concern,
they
couldn't
arise,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
solicitor
i
--
i'm
rather
confident
that
an
order
of
enforcement
would
almost
literally
read,
go
comply
with
award.
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
that
we
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
it
mr.
hunt
there
was
no
--
no
contestant
unit
determination
herewith?
