mr.
owne
j.
ooms
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices.
before
going
into
the
argument
of
specifically
answering
petitioner's
statements,
i
would
like
to
correct
the
record
in
two
principal
areas.
counsel
has
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
respondent
herein
has
driven
competitors
out
of
business.
has
used
this
as
some
sort
of
sword
for
a
number
of
years.
let
me
say,
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
any
such
statement.
respondent
never
drove
anyone
out
of
business.
it,
acting
under
its
rights
of
any
patentee,
wrote
letters
to
those
who
they
deemed
infringed.
two
suits
were
filed.
consent
judgments
were
entered.
seven
other
companies
ceased
to
manufacture.
the
other
area
i
would
like
to
correct
is
that
we
do
not
have
here
just
some
functional
reflector.
there
are
specific
findings
in
the
district
court
with
respect
to
this.
it
is
true
the
court
found
that
the
designed
patent
did
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
invention,
as
laid
down
by
this
court
and
especially
the
amp
case.
but,
the
court
did
stay,
and
i
read
from
finding
of
fact
13,
that
this
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
i
am
reading
from
the
record
299,
your
honor.
the
design
of
the
various
elements,
and
this
is
where
the
court
found
there
was
functionality,
namely
in
opening
a
writ.
the
design
of
the
element
per
se
of
plaintiff's
reflector
is
functional
and
it
is
only
in
the
number,
size,
and
specific
placement
of
those
elements
that
there
are
nonfunctional
features.
so
we
do
have
nonfunctional
features
present.
this
is
very
important
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
unfair
competition.
furthermore,
in
finding
17,
the
district
court
specifically
found,
and
i
read
from
finding
17
at
page
300
of
the
record,
"neither
the
addition
of
reinforcing
ribs
nor
the
extension
of
ribs
disclosed
in
the
prior
art
is
invention,
although
the
result
in
overall
appearance
of
the
design
of
plaintiff's
patent
is
distinctive."
now,
what
we
have
here
is
and
has
been
growing
up
since
probably
world
war
ii.
that
is
manufacturers
of
utilitarian
products,
one
of
which
this
court
had
under
the
guise
of
the
copyright
protection
in
the
mazer
versus
stein
case
in
1954.
there
has
grown
up
in
the
industrial
world
what
we
call,
dress
or
product
identification.
normally
in
--
merely
a
chair,
as
justice
black
points
out,
or
a
reflector,
the
manufacturer
wants
to
have
his
product
identifying
him
as
a
source.
now,
there's
only
one
way
he
can
do
it
and
that
is
by
putting
in
features,
whether
it
might
be
the
chair
or
it
maybe
a
reflector
or
whatever
article
of
manufacturer.
he
desires
to
put
features
in
there
so
that
when
the
buying
public
has
seen
it
sufficiently,
they
will
say
that
is
the
manufacturer
of,
in
this
case,
the
respondent.
that
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
you
do
have
the
problem,
as
justice
goldberg
inquired
about,
these
are
reflectors
hanging
from
a
ceiling
and
i
--
if
i,
anyone
to
read
a
small
label
saying
its
day-brite
besides
that,
the
person
who
used
it
does
not
want
to
be
advertising
the
products
of
others.
so,
what
--
the
only
thing
you
have
left
is
to
build
identification
into
the
product
per
se.
that
was
the
purpose
behind
this
reflector,
as
testified
to,
as
put
in
the
record.
it
is
also
cited
in
our
brief
precisely.
this
is
what
the
respondent
did.
the
court
found
that
it
did
possess
nonfunctional
features,
that
it
was
distinctive.
the
court
also
made
one
very,
very
salient
finding,
finding
24
at
the
record
301.
it
stated
that
this
particular
fixture
had
the
capacity
to
identify
the
respondent
and
in
fact,
it
did
so
identify
the
respondent.
there
were
witnesses
who
testified
to
the
same
fact.
now
counsel
here
has
stated
and
had
agreed,
and
rightly
so,
that
they
copied
--
they
wanted
to
copy
the
best.
that
meant
they
wanted
to
copy
the
functional,
the
nonfunctional,
the
distinctive,
the
thing
that
sold
this
particular
type
of
fixture.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
not
the
law,
your
honor.
even
though
a
patent,
whether
it
be
design
or
mechanical
is
not
present,
this
does
not
permit
a
competitor
to
slavishly
copy
it
if
that
particular
item
does
possess
what
we
call
"secondary
meaning."
now,
what
do
we
mean
by
"secondary
meaning"?
the
courts
have
laid
down
the
rules
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief
that
you
may
copy
the
functional
features.
no
one
can
get
a
monopoly
on
that.
i
wholeheartedly
agree.
the
law
has
been
in
that
posture
for
years.
the
function
means
that,
in
this
particular
case,
the
rib
right
here
functions
to
strengthen
it.
that's
the
only
function
of
it.
however,
you
can
do
certain
things
to
an
element
that
functions
in
a
particular
way
to
make
it
distinctive.
here,
it
was
run
all
the
way
down.
again
remembering,
you
have
to
look
at
this
from
the
side.
it
would
have
no
identification
and
there's
nothing
in
the
prior
art
heretofore
that
ran
beyond
just
the
bare
sides
of
this.
there's
--
was
conflicting
testimony
that
it
did
add
strength.
we
agree
that
it
did
add
strength
but
it
also
served
as
a
means
of
identification
when
you
look
up
at
a
ceiling.
similarly,
by
arranging
functional
elements
in
a
particular
manner,
just
as
--
just
as
we
have
in
everything.
you
can
put
four
legs
on
a
chair,
as
your
honor
has
used
as
an
illustration,
but
you
can
put
various
scrollings
and
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
pardon?
you
can
put
five
on
them.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
certainly
not.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
certainly
not.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that's
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
if
it
is
nonfunctional
and
it
has
acquired
a
secondary
meaning,
yes,
your
honor.
that
has
been
the
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
pardon?
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
it's
wholly
functional,
your
honor
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
part
nonfunctional,
aesthetic
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
identification
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
--
if
he
copies
the
nonfunctional
characteristics
and
here
the
district
court
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
--
specifically
found
this.
that
in
the
arrangement
of
the
sides,
the
spacing,
the
configuration
that
it
has
the
capacity
to
identify
a
particular
manufacturer,
then
it
is
nonfunctional.
that
it
has
become
distinctive.
this
is
where
the
law
of
unfair
competition
is
not
in
any
conflict
whatsoever
with
the
federal
supremacy
laws
of
patent
which
was
the
primary
basis
of
the
petition
herein.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes,
sir?
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
no
sir,
there's
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
there
is
--
there
is
not
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
they
palmed
it
off.
but
i
might
add
further
your
honor,
that
palming
off
is
no
longer
required
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
illinois
as
it
is
in
practically
every
other
state.
that
is,
applying
the
erie
versus
tompkins
doctrine.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
it
is
not
required.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
palming
off
is
not
required.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
oh,
majority
by
far,
your
honor.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
and
even
in
the
new
lanham
act
which
applies
to
trademarks,
all
that
is
required
is
that
there
be
likelihood
of
confusions.
our
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
had
reiterated
this
in
the
independent
nail
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
has
had
occasion
to
reiterate
it
time
and
time
again.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
usually,
it
goes
through
a
how
--
wholesale
outlet
and
by
contractors
who
take
a
look
at
this.
they
walk
into
a
showroom,
and
there
they
are
hanging
and
say
"i
like
that."
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
right.
and
they
don't
know
if
it's
whose
manufacture.
a,
y,
x,
they
don't
know.
they
say,
"i
like
that
feature."
so
if
you
have
a
particular
fixture,
a
reflector
in
this
case,
which
is
the
only
source
of
identification,
not
this
housing,
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
this
lawsuit.
if
they
like
it
and
it
has
been
a
good
seller,
then
obviously
your
competition
comes
in.
now
this
they
can
copy,
your
honor,
if
it
is
wholly
functional.
but
if
that
reflector
has
built
into
it,
which
this
district
court
has
found,
has
built
into
it
product
identification
so
that
these
people
who
are
skilled
buyers,
insofar
as
they
recognize
the
feature
say,
"i
like
that
feature
--
fixture.
i
want
that
fixture."
now,
this
makes
it
very
easy
for
him
to
say,
"i've
got
the
same
fixture
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
--
for
$10
less.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes,
sir.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
that
follows
after
the
initial
introduction
of
a
product.
before
you
--
you
can
say
that
it
--
i
--
particularly
identifies
a
particular
source,
what
you
are
saying
is
three
or
four
years
after
depending
upon
the
success
and
let
us
admit,
the
advertising
and
promotion
of
this,
particularly
one
said,
"i
recognize
that
as
the
respondent's
fixture.
that's
what
i
want."
or
he
sees
it
in
an
ad.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
now,
that's
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
i
wouldn't
counsel
my
client
to
try
it
for
a
copyright,
although
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
might
say,
said
that
that
it
acts,
because
of
this
trade
identification,
acts
somewhat
as
a
trademark
because
it
is
a
badge
of
origin.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
law
has
provided
a
number
of
ways.
this
court
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes,
sir.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that's
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
it
has
acquired
identification
as
capable
of
identification
and
has
acquired
a
secondary
meaning.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
certainly,
we
put
our
name
on
it.
certainly,
we
put
our
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
without
our
name
on
it,
no
one
can,
your
honor.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct,
under
the
law
of
unfair
competition.
there's
nothing
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes
sir.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
--
monopoly,
i
would
accept
that
word.
i
mean
it
has
a
odious
connotation
but
yes,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
purpose.
we
are
trying
to
identify
our
fixtures
so
that
when
people
purchase
this
fixture,
they
can
rely
on
the
source
of
manufacturer.
now
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
yes,
sir.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
that
is
correct.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
i
think
there
we're
getting
to
the
meat
of
why
we're
right
here
before
this
court
right
now.
there
seems
to
be
some
inference
here
that
because
you
have
obtained
a
design
patent
that
you
cannot
also
have
unfair
competition.
this
is
a
simple
complaint.
in
two
counts,
it
follows
section
1338,
28
u.s.c.
1338
(b),
it
follows
forum
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
it
accepts
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
mazer
versus
stein
in
1954,
namely,
one
count
for
design
patent
infringement,
one
count
for
unfair
competition,
each
standing
alone.
now,
these
counts
arise
differently.
the
count
for
design
patent
infringement
arises
when
the
design
patent
issues.
that
gives
us
our
right
under
that
count
against
any
one
we
claim
to
be
an
infringer.
under
unfair
competition,
that
count
arises
after
our
product
has
been
put
on
the
market
and
after
it
has
been
exposed
to
the
public
a
sufficient
time
so
that
it
becomes
identifiable
to
have
a
significant
meaning
of
source
to
the
public.
now,
there
--
they
rely
sometimes
on
the
same
facts,
sometimes
they
rely
in
different
facts.
as
long
as
it
has
the
capacity
to
identify
and
in
fact
does
so
identify,
it
has
acquired
this
secondary
meaning.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
let's
be
very
frank.
that
--
that's
his
position
but
i
don't
agree
with
it.
i
--
i
think
the
design
patent
was
a
crutch
in
the
aid
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
cause
of
action
for
unfair
competition
whatsoever.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
(voice
overlap)
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
well,
there
are
many
decisions
that
says
secondary
meaning
can
be
acquired
in
a
matter
of
two
months,
two
years,
or
five
years.
that
depends
upon
the
success
of
the
product
and
how
he
has
or
whether
he
has
sufficiently
identified
it
to
the
public.
now,
there's
no
design
patent
on
the
coca
cola
bottle,
yet,
i
daresay
they
--
they
would
have
no
problem,
without
it,
of
stopping
anyone
from
copying
it
id
--
exactly
as
it
is.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
the
coca
cola
bottle.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
i
think
we're
quite
familiar.
and
i
think
the
same
thing
will
be
true
with
regard
to
the
new
michelob
bottle
of
beer
which
is
very,
very
distinctive.
and
i'm
certain
there's
no
design
patent
on
that.
the
very
fact
that
a
design
patent,
that
the
practitioner
to
whom
this
manufacture
went
to
and
said,
"now,
how
can
i
protect
my
product?"
he
says,
"you
can
go
under
the
patent
statute
or
you
can
do
nothing
because
the
patent
is
fraught
with
this
question
of
what
is
invention?"
and
as
justice
jackson
said
in
this
court
in
the
ausby
case,
"only
--
the
only
valid
patent
is
a
patent
that
the
supreme
court
can't
get
its
hands
on."
so,
he
has
to
counsel
his
manufacturing
client
and
he
said,
"let's
go
for
a
secondary
meaning."
now,
this
is
running
pretty
rampant
through
the
bar
as
to
what
they
should
do.
it
is
a
very
serious
question.
this
court
never
had
quite
that
problem
in
mazer
versus
stein
but
it
had
no
hesitancy
in
stating
that
even
though
the
lamp
which
was
before
it,
which
was
utilitarian,
which
was
ornamental,
had
both.
it
had
the
functional
and
the
nonfunctional
features.
it
had
no
hesitancy
in
saying
that
even
though
you
could've
patent
it,
the
fact
that
he
proceeded
under
the
copyright
law
and
obtained
his
protection,
we're
not
going
to
say
that,
because
he
went
under
one
heading
or
one
federal
statute
in
lieu
of
another,
that
that
is
wrong.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
just
recently
after
the
mazer
versus
stein
decision
here
and
the
benarous
case,
a
court
in
new
york
stated
that
counsel
ought
to
be
complemented
upon
seeking
any
type
of
protection
he
can
on
the
theory
that
a
court
may
knock
down
one
and
uphold
the
other.
now,
in
patents,
we
have
this
question
of
always
overcoming
what
is
patentability,
what
is
invention.
we
do
not
have
that
in
the
copyright
law.
all
it
has
to
do
is
be
original.
in
the
area
of
unfair
competition,
we've
got
to
show
that
it
acquired
a
secondary
meaning,
which
we
have
here.
now,
there's
one
other
point.
most
of
the
cases
in
petitioner's
brief
deal
only
with
the
fact
of
expired
patents.
that
is,
after
the
patentee
has
had
his
full
monopoly
under
the
patent,
in
this
case
14
years.
we
have
never
had
that
in
this
particular
case.
we
haven't
had
the
14
years
or
anything.
the
constitution
says
it
shall
secure,
not
devest.
in
this
case,
and
as
far
as
our
legal
research
has
been
able
to
ascertain,
there
has
been
only
one
case
which
has
dealt
with
the
difference
between
the
expiration
of
a
patent
and
a
patent
which
has
been
judiciously
declared
invalid.
now,
i
might
say
that
this
patent
is
not
a
dead
letter
right
today.
it's
only
invalid
insofar
as
the
petitioner
here
is
concerned.
and
all
that
the
court
below
--
it
didn't
say
anything
else
as
to
anyone
else,
all
that
the
court
below
has
enjoined
him
from
unfair
competition.
now,
the
government
--
the
government
had
no
problem
saying
that
there
was
--
the
federal
patent
supremacy
law
as
contrast
to
the
unfair
competition
because
they
said,
in
this
particular
case,
although
we
have
a
companion
case
which
follows
immediately
after,
we
were
entitled
under
the
findings
of
fact,
in
the
court
below,
we
are
entitled
to
relief.
they
only
stated
that
we
don't
believe
the
relief
should
be
as
strong,
though
it
should
be
less
stringent.
now,
in
that
regard,
i
don't
have
to
remind
the
court
that
the
court
here
does
not
sit
in
function
to
review
findings
of
fact
or
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
in
support
of
the
findings
and
that's
in
southern
power
company
versus
north
carolina
public
service
company.
the
government
has
suggested
to
this
court
that
it
remand
it
so
that
this
particular
defendant-petitioner
can
sufficiently
market
so
that
the
public
will
know
what
is
the
source
of
the
product.
to
that,
we
answer,
although
we
agree
with
the
governm
--
the
government's
petition
in
many
respects,
we
do
not
believe
with
the
relief
or
the
remand
that
it
suggests
for
this
reason.
that
he
has,
that
is,
the
petitioner
enjoyed
for
eight
years
his
acts
of
unfair
competition
as
found
by
the
district
court
and
the
three
courts
of
appeal.
we
do
not
believe
that
by
merely
labeling
now
in
a
proper
manner,
that
he
can
dissipate
the
effects
of
the
unfair
competition.
the
law
is
repeat
with
--
replete
with
cases
that
say
a
wrongdoer
is
under
a
greater
obligation
than
the
third
party.
now,
i
believe
i
mentioned
to
the
court
very
briefly
that
there
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
that
deals
with
the
particular
matter
of
an
expired
patent
versus
an
unexpired
patent.
and
that
is
the
lucien
lelong
case
at
164
f.2d
395,
cited
at
our
--
only
in
respondent's
brief
in
opposition
at
pages
7
and
8
where
the
court
said,
"if
in
return
for
the
statutory
monopoly
or
a
term
the
patentee
has
held
thereafter
to
dedicate
his
invention
to
the
public,
it
would
naturally
follow
that
where
he
had
never
had
this
monopoly,
he
has
nothing
to
give
up.
the
situation
is
one
where
no
patent
has
ever
existed."
that
is
the
only
pronouncement
i
can
find
as
the
difference
between
an
expired
patent.
that
is,
one
that
has
run
its
full
patent
monopoly,
its
term
17
years
with
regard
to
a
mechanical
patent
and
14
years
with
regard
to
a
design
patent.
now,
i
suggest
that
what
respondent
has
done
here
is
merely
follow
the
teaching
that
this
court
laid
down
in
mazer
versus
stein,
a
decision
in
1954.
namely,
that
we
have
elected
two
causes
of
action
to
protect
our
client's
rights,
namely,
design
patent
infringement
and
unfair
competition.
now,
in
the
case
of
mazer
versus
stein,
the
court
had
no
problem
of
a
monopoly,
although
it
upheld
the
copyright
there
which
is
good
for
28
years
plus
a
renewal
of
28
years
versus
a
design
patent
of
a
maximum
of
14
years.
so
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld,
in
effect,
a
monopoly
for
56
years
versus
the
fact
that
he
could've
proceeded
under
another
federal
statute
for
a
period
of
14
years.
we
are
doing
the
same
thing
here
only,
instead
of
applying
the
copyright,
we
are
applying
unfair
competition
as
pronounced
by
our
court
of
appeals
and
the
illinois
court.
we
can
see
that,
in
this
respect,
we
are
merely
following
the
teaching
what
this
court
has
laid
down
and
what
i
have
cited
from
the
benarous
case.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
although
the
petitioner
has
raised
the
question
that
this
violates
the
antitrust
law,
i
submit,
i
--
i
can't
find
nothing
in
the
record
to
--
to
so
label
this.
it
is
a
mere
case
of
unfair
competition.
this
gentleman
decided
to
copy
a
product
that
had
identification
built
into
it.
a
product
which
the
court
found
as
such
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
and
the
fact
that
we
did
have
a
design
patent
momentarily
and
never
enjoyed
its
full
term
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
count
under
unfair
competition.
we
say
we
are
following
the
teach
--
teaching
in
mazer
versus
stein
and
that
there
is
no
conflict.
accordingly,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
in
view
of
this
court's
pronouncement
that
it
does
not
seek
to
set
aside
findings
of
fact
where
they
have
been
concurred
in.
thank
you,
your

you

you

your

the

have
acquired

as
that

as
i
read
from

the

the
court
of

said
if

wanted
to

if
he
wanted
to
follow
the

there
were
many
ways
that
he
could've
made

obtained

this
is
one
other
thing
to
a
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
stated.
this
petitioner
had
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
the
same
function
by
just
making
it
a
little
bit
different,
but
he
chose
to
exactly

that

he
could've
put

there

and
we
even
had

mr.

so
much,
i
would

would
be
in
the
area
of
a
question
of
fact,
your

there
are
certainly
ribs
and
--
and
these,
what
we
call
uplights
or
openings
put
out
by

they
have

mr.

why
wouldn't
it,
your

mr.

because
they
are
immediately
capitalizing
upon
identification.
now,
in
this
particular
one
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
--
if
i
may
answer
my
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
i
--
i
will
show
how.
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
company
of
one
of
the
purchasers
of
their
reflectors
had
a
whole
bunch
of
them
and
they
had
been
designated
to
purchase
the
respondent's
reflectors.
something
went
wrong
with
several
of
them
and
they
called
the
respondent
and
when
they
got
on
a
ladder
and
found
out
that
they
were
the
--
that
of
the
petitioner's.
so
even
though,
initially,
the
sale
might
have
been
in
all
good
faith
and
honesty,
you
have
subsequent
problems
with
this
particular
matter.
and
this
makes
it
very
easy
for
them
to
come
in
and
say,
"i've
got
the
same
product.
i
don't
have
the
advertising
or
the
research
cost
that
our
competitor
has
or
who's
the
leader.
you
can
buy
mine
therefore
for
$2
cheaper."
this
isn't
the
problem,
your
honor
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
--
with
your
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
--
question.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
he
--
if
he
can
fit
within
the
particular
principles
that
i
have
said
with
respect
to
identification
and
the
secondary
meaning.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
no.
if
they
are
strictly
functional
features,
your
honor,
then
--
then
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
he
can't
ever
do
this.
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
you
--
mr.
owne
j.
ooms
if
you
build
in
dress
or
product
design
into
the
thing
so
that
it
has
product
identification,
then
i
would
agree
100%
with
your
honor.
thank
you.
