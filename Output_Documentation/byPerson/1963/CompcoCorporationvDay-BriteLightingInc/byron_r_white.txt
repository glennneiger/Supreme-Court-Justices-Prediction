in
your
example
of
the
contractor
coming
into
the
showroom
--
justice

he
looks
up
at
the
ceiling
and
he
doesn't
--
you
said,
he
doesn't
know
who
manufactures
it
at
all.
if
it
had
a
--
if
it
actually
had
acquired
identification
in
his
mind,
he
would
say
--
he
would
say,
"i
want
so-and-so's
fixtures."

to
avoid
being
in
trouble
with
the
--
justice
byron

white
yes,
but
you
say
that
the
functional
features
is
what
has
acquired
some
identifications.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
we
have
to
--
in
each
case,
we
would
have
to
--
have
to
say
what
it
was
that
--
about
your
product
that
it
become
identified
with
the
--
in
the
minds
of
potential
customers?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
it
maybe,
of
course,
that
this
changing
that
spacing
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
dispel
the
--
in
the
mind
of
a
customer
the
--
this
identification.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it'd
still
be
the
same
--
look
--
look
like,
let's
just
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
he
has
--
that
he
has
to
do
so
much
that
--
that
no
customer
could
--
or
potential
customer
could
confuse
your
product
to
his.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
that
any
amount
of
precautions
at
the
point
of
sale
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
will
--
will
suffice?
justice
byron

let's
assume
that
this
--
let's
assume
that
this
test
of
--
that
this
--
by
this
opponent
of
yours
had
--
had
sold
only
through
its
own
retail
outlets,
through
its
own
employees
and
when
anybody
who
went
into
the
place
knew
exactly
what
they
were
getting,
knew
precisely
what
they
were
getting.
your
name
was
over
the
door
and
every
salesman
said,
"remember,
now,
you're
buying
x
and
not
y."
that
wouldn't
be
enough
from
your
approach.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
it,
for
heaven's
sake?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
will
you
do
it
as
capitalization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
--
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
sounds
like
then
that
--
that
really,
if
someone
develops
a
market
for
a
product,
he
ought
to
have
it
--
have
it
for
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that's
just
saying
the
same
thing
in
a
million
other
words.
it's
simply
the
product
was
identified
in
the
customer's
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
that
leaves
the
rest
and
what
i
say
is
true
about
the
nonfunctional.
oh,
you
just
make
a
--
then
make
a
product
and
--
and
spend
enough
money
on
it
and
you're
going
to
get
it
identified
in
the
--
in
the
public
mind,
that's
for
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
develop
a
market
for
it.
