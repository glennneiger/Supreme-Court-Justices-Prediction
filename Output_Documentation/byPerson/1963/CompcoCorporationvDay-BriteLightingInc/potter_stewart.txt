justice

mr.
fallon.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
from
what
you've
told
us
so
far
and
particularly
right
now,
that
you're
whole
case
depends
upon
the
fact,
and
it
is
a
fact,
that
the
respondent
had
a
design
patent
which
protected
it
for
some
five
years
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
never
applied
for
a
design
patent
and
--
and
nonetheless
sued
you
in
the
district
court
and
let's
assume,
diversity
jurisdiction
for
unfair
competition
and
hadn't
prevailed
under
the
law
of
unfair
competition
of
illinois.
justice
potter
stewart
you'd
have
quite
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
the
respondent
did
prevail,
of
course,
in
his
unfair
competition
claim
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
court
purport
to
be
applying
an
illinois
law
or
a
federal
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
just
some
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
illinois
law.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
when
you
say,
he
would've
been
hard
put
to
prevail,
that's
contrary
to
what
happened
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
here,
he
prevailed
despite
the
fact
that
the
patent
--
he
had
had
a
patent
which
was
declared
invalid.
the
case
i
gave
you
was
--
on
the
hypothesis
there'd
never
been
a
patent.
so,
i
suppose
a
fortiori,
in
this
particular
court
at
least,
he
would've
prevailed.
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
so
that
brings
us
back,
i
suppose,
to
my
original
question.
the
answer
is,
as
i
--
as
you
gave
originally
that
your
case
largely
depends
upon
the
fact
that
the
respondent
did
have
a
design
patent.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
he
--
he
could
put
his
name
on
it
and
--
and
do
his
best
to
make
his
product
a
very
good
one.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
its
part
functional,
and
part
--
part
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
it
is
required
or
--
in
a
--
in
nearly
every
other
state?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
required
in
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
required
in
illinois.
now,
is
that
--
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
minority
rule,
do
you
say,
or
the
majority
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
the
petitioner's
point
is,
as
i
get
it,
that
your
product
would
never
have
acquired
this
capacity
to
identify
had
it
not
been
for
the
protection
of
the
design
patent
which
was
subsequently
held
invalid.
because
from
the
very
beginning,
there
could've
been
very
free
copying
and
your
client
would
not
have
had
the
protection
during
that
five-year
period
of
a
design
patent,
later
found
to
be
invalid,
which
gave
the
time
and
the
opportunity
for
this
particular
design
to
be
identified
exclusively
with
your
client
as
its
manufacturer.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
assuming,
assuming
there
had
been
no
design
patent,
then
the
very
moments
your
prior
--
product
went
on
the
market,
anybody
could've
freely
copied
it,
isn't
that
true,
because
at
that
very
moment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
wouldn't
have
acquired
any
identification
with
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
was
not
a
design
patent?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
i
could
sell
eau
de
cologne
in
--
in
coke
bottles,
couldn't
i?
it
has
to
be
competitive
then,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
some
relation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
evidence
doesn't
help
you,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
--
who
was
then,
presumably,
a
sophisticated
expert
in
his
--
in
this
limited
area?
