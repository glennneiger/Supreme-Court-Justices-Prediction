justice

suppose
there
had
been
no
patent.
your
question,
i
suppose,
would
have
been
whether
the
state
can
by
naming
something
unfair
competition,
give
the
same
advantage
to
a
particular
chair,
we'll
say,
that's
manufactured
as
though
it
had
a
patent.
i
don't
see
why
you're
dependent
on
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
get
a
patent.
you
may
be
--
maybe
wrong
to
say
that
a
state
can't
do
that
but
i
suppose
a
state
could
do
it
the
same
whether
they
had
applied
for
a
patent
or
haven't
applied
for
a
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
get
is
--
what's
--
what
i'm
talking
about
is
this.
we
must
assume,
as
i
understand
what
mr.
justice
stewart
was
asking,
in
illinois
law,
they
say
that
it's
illegal
and
you'd
get
damages.
companies
that
have
been
manufacturing
a
certain
kind
of
a
--
well,
anything,
say,
if
you
said
chair,
something
else.
i
call
it
a
chair.
they've
advertised
it
as
theirs.
must
we
not
assume
that
under
illinois
law
that
if
a
man
came
along
and
copied
that
chair
he'd
--
he'd
violate
what
they
call
the
fair
trade
law
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unfair
competition,
what
he
was
doing.
isn't
that
what
we
find
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
that
your
petition
for
certiorari
may
be
stated
a
little
better
than
you
have.
i
thought
that
when
you
asked
us
to
take
it
up,
the
question
you
asked
was
whether
they
can
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
patent
under
the
label
--
by
labeling
it
"unfair
competition."
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
shows
--
it
shows
very
clearly
that
they
couldn't
get
a
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
shows
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
very
clearly
that
they
couldn't
get
the
benefit
of
a
monopoly
through
a
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
it
shows
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
show
--
that
doesn't
--
certainly
it
does,
does
it,
whether
they
can
get
a
monopoly
under
the
states?
it
might
have
just
as
well
been
called
a
patent
law
that
covered
it,
appeals
why
the
government
doesn't
give
it.
the
government
doesn't
give
a
patent,
let's
say,
for
a
thing
like
this.
therefore,
illinois
can
give
a
patent.
they
do
it
under
the
name
of
unfair
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
finding?
how
can
a
confusion
result
except
for
one
thing,
that
it
can
be
held
that
there'll
be
a
confusion
among
purchasers?
if
one
manufacturer
of
a
piece
of
furniture
has
been
manufacturing
it
for
several
years
and
somebody
else
manufactures
precisely
the
same
piece
of
furniture,
is
that
--
was
there
any
evidence
of
confusion,
except
to
that
extent?
was
there
any
evidence
of
--
of
any
deceit
practiced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
what
you
have
is
a
step
to
the
so-called
furniture
whether
illinois
law
can
make
it
illegal
so
as
to
subject
you
for
damages
for
selling
a
piece
of
furniture
made
precisely
like
a
piece
of
furniture
sold
by
another
company
for
some
years
and
whether
illinois
can,
by
saying
that
confuses
the
public,
give
it
the
benefit
of
a
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
i
thought
that
unless
an
article,
commodity
like
a
piece
of
furniture
was
patented,
anybody
had
a
right
to
copy
it
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
you
can
put
five.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
made
chairs
with
five
legs.
would
everybody
else
be
barred
from
making
chairs
with
five
legs
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
like
yours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
put
lines
here
on
the
side
of
that.
that
would
identify
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand,
what
you
are
arguing
here,
if
you'd
put
lines
here
on
the
side
of
that,
which
you
know
is
not
a
part
of
its
function,
somebody
else
copied
that
with
the
lines
here
that
without
a
patent,
they
could
be
held
liable
in
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand,
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
(inaudible)
article,
would
it
--
would
you
have
any
copyright
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
copy
--
copyright
or
a
trademark?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
cases
had
been
along
that
line,
but
what
about
a
trademark?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
the
law
has
provided
a
trademark.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
--
you
could
get
a
monopoly
by
a
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
by
trademark
or
by
copyright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
argued
here
is
that
you
can
get
a
monopoly
on
a
product,
not
because
somebody's
deceived
by
buying
it
but
you
can
get
a
monopoly
simply
because
a
man
copies
it
and
you've
been
making
it
and
selling
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
your
products?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
product.
well,
do
you
put
your
name
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
claim
that
if
you
put
--
with
your
name
on
it,
nobody
can
copy
it
as
it
is
now
and
sell
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
a
--
without
a
patent,
without
a
copyright,
and
without
a
trademark.
