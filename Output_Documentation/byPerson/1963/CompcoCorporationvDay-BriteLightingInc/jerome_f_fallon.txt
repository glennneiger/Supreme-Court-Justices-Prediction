mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
this
is
an
unfair
competition
case
wherein
the
petitioner,
compco,
was
permanently
enjoined
from
selling
this
particular
fixture,
to
sell
fluorescent
light
fixture
and
all
others
that
are
confusingly
similar.
this
particular
fixture
is
not
often
seen
by
the
average
person
because
it's
an
industrial
fixture.
it's
mounted
near
the
ceiling,
not
quite
at
the
ceiling,
of
factories.
it's
arranged
for
end-to-end
installation
and
it's
not
unusual
for
50
or
100
of
these
things
to
be
installed
in
a
long
line.
they
come
in
standard
sizes.
this
is
the
48-inch
size,
the
smallest
size.
it's
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
sir,
except
for
this.
we
have
these
elongated
slots
which
cast
light
upwards.
so,
ordinarily
these
would
be
bolted
to
the
trusses,
which
are
the
cross
a-shaped
members
that
are
in
a
factory
so
that
there
maybe
05
or
10
feet
between
the
actual
roof
and
the
top
of
this
housing.
the
components
of
the
fixture
include
the
housing,
this
rectangular
shape
portion
which
includes
all
of
the
wiring
and
the
ballasts
which
are
heavy
transformers
needed
to
spark
the
light
tubes
that
are
included
down
below.
the
light
tubes
are
supported
from
socket
portions
which
hang
down
from
the
housing
and
then
sandwiched
in
between
is
the
reflector
portion.
and
it
is
this
with
which
we
are
concerned
primarily
because
all
of
the
other
elements
are
old
or
there
are
substantial
differences
between
what
compco
puts
out
and
what
the
plaintiff
below,
the
respondent
here,
day-brite
has
in
their
fixture.
now,
the
up-lighting
fixtures
of
this
type,
having
these
slots
became
popular
in
the
early
1950s.
shortly
after
that,
they
faced
a
problem
in
this
art
because
the
porcelain
coating,
this
is
like
we
find
on
sinks
and
bathtubs,
this
porcelain
enamel,
tended
to
chip
and
it
was
determined
that
the
chipping
occurred
because
of
--
because
the
metal,
the
steel
of
this
reflector,
when
it
was
heated
during
this
enameling
operation
up
to
about
1600
degrees,
tended
to
warp
and
twist
so
as
to
get
out
of
alignment.
and
therefore,
there
were
inbred
strains,
you
might
say,
so
that
this
fixture,
when
it
was
handled
later
on,
would
tend
to
chip,
the
porcelain
enamel
would
pop
off.
this
was
solved
by
the
respondent
here,
day-brite,
by
elongating
these
ribs
so
that
they
came
down
here
to
provide
additional
stiffness
for
this
size,
to
make
this
--
to
make
the
side
stiff.
in
all
other
respects,
the
reflector
is
like
the
prior
art
that
which
preceded
it.
the
prior
art
had
the
elongated
slots.
it
had
the
ribs
about
this
far.
but
in
order
to
overcome
this
problem
of
porcelain
chipping,
especially
along
the
sides,
like
these
ribs,
i
beg
your
pardon,
they
look
like
grooves
here.
they're
ribs
when
you
look
at
them
from
the
underside.
these
--
these
ribs
were
extended.
now,
this
gave
the
reflector
the
resistance
that
it
needed
and
this
point
was
very
heavily
emphasized
by
day-brite,
the
initiator
of
the
elongated
ribs.
we
point
out,
in
our
brief,
the
feature
of
strength
that
was
emphasized
by
day-brite.
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
we
have
this
little
folded
in
advertisement
of
day-brite
where
they
show
a
358-pound
man
seated
on
one
of
these,
showing
how
stiff
and
how
strong
they
really
are,
emphasizing
in
bold
letters
the
strength.
quite
rightly,
day-brite
filed
a
mechanical
patent
application
on
this
because
this
is
a
functional
or
a
mechanical
improvement.
they
filed
this
application.
it
went
all
the
way
to
the
patent
office
and
to
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals
and
it
was
turned
down
because
the
patent
office
held
that
this
was
an
obvious
expedient,
the
normal
thing
someone
would
do
if
they
wanted
to
increase
the
strength
of
a
reflector.
a
common
place
example
of
the
use
of
ribs
is
in
corrugated
paperboard.
it's
very
easy
to
fold
paperboard
that
way,
parallel
with
the
length
of
the
corrugations
or
ribs,
but
you
have
to
practically
crack
it
in
order
to
fold
it
the
other
way.
so,
that
was
what
was
attempted
to
be
done
here.
there's
one
type
of
stiffness
afforded
by
the
slip
and
then
the
other
type
of
stiffness
can
keep
these
sides
from
warping
was
provided
by
elongating
these
ribs
from
this
point
down
to
there.
however,
day-brite
was
successful
in
the
patent
office.
they
got
a
design
patent.
a
design
patent
in
contrast
to
a
mechanical
patent
has
to
do
with
the
ornamental
aspect,
the
beauty,
the
aesthetics,
the
flow
of
curves
and
lines.
this
has
to
do
with
any
industrial
or
commercial
article.
any
article
of
manufacture
can
be
design
patented.
that
includes
a
lighting
fixture,
a
dress,
a
concrete
mixer,
anything
that's
got
an
aesthetic
appearance,
you
--
you
can
design
a
patent,
the
nonfunctional
or
aesthetic
features.
and
they
were
successful
in
convincing
the
patent
office
that
the
reflector
portion
had
this
requisite
ornamentation
or
distinctiveness
as
far
as
design
is
concerned.
now,
this
is
precisely
--
this
same
aspect
of
ornamentation
or
distinctiveness
in
the
aesthetic
sense
is
precisely
the
same
thing
that's
involved
in
unfair
competition.
in
this
case,
that
people
have
always
been
believed
to
or
permitted
to
copy
the
functional
aspects.
the
unfair
competition
law
in
the
past
said,
"well,
there
may
be
something
wrong
if
you
copy
the
nonfunctional
or
the
aesthetic
aspects
because
they
serve
to
identify
it.
you
don't
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
get
a
better
article."
however,
the
design
patent
was
held
invalid
for
two
--
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
was
held
non-inventive
over
what
had
gone
before.
the
court
said
merely
extending
these
ribs
didn't
add
anything
really
inventive
as
far
as
design
is
concerned
and
here
we
should
appreciate
that
a
design
patent
has
to
meet
the
same
standards
of
invention
as
a
mechanical
patent.
they're
all
in
the
same
statute,
both
covered
by
the
same
statute.
there's
a
difference
that
the
maximum
term
of
a
design
patent
is
14
years,
whereas,
the
term
of
a
mechanical
patent
is
automatically
17.
so,
they
said
that
the
patent
office
didn't
have
the
best
prior
art
before
it.
it
didn't
have
anything
that
showed
slots
and
ribs,
at
least
coming
across
this
far.
so,
when
the
court
saw
this
better
prior
art,
it
said
the
design
patent
was
invalid
because
the
patent
office
hadn't
seen
the
best
prior
art.
the
court
also
said
that,
clearly,
the
ribs
are
functional.
therefore,
you
can't
have
a
design
patent
on
that
basis.
now
day-brite,
during
the
time
that
this
patent
was
in
effect,
some
five
years
or
so,
used
this
as
a
very
effective
sword.
they
made
at
least
nine
rather
modest
sized
competitors,
either
change
their
construction
or
go
out
of
the
business
entirely,
these
competitors
ranging
from
long
island
out
to
los
angeles.
and,
about
the
only
thing
that
was
common
are
these
competitors
had
variations
in
this
design.
the
one
feature
in
common
with
all
of
them
was
the
fact
that
they
made
use
of
this
longer
rib
which
was
put
in
there
for
then
purpose
of
strengthening.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
fact
that
they
carried
on
this
extensive
litigation
program
certainly
confirms
the
fact
that
day-brite
elected
to
get
its
coverage,
its
protection,
its
monopoly
on
this,
if
you
please,
through
the
patent
laws.
and
the
law,
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
when
a
patent
expires,
either
prematurely
by
virtue
of
invalidation
or
by
virtue
of
running
its
term,
that
particular
construction
goes
into
the
public
domain.
that
is
the
condition
under
which
the
patent
is
granted.
the
patent
law
specifies
that
there
must
be
a
complete
disclosure,
a
full
disclosure,
just
for
the
purpose
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
term,
whether
it's
14
years
for
a
design
patent
or
17
years
for
a
mechanical
patent,
that
then
the
public
who
has
given
up
this
or
given
an
individual
this
monopoly
that
then
they
could
have
the
benefit
of
it
and
copy
this.
and
the
design
patent
shows
exactly
what
we
have
here,
give
or
take
some
changes
in
dimensions
and
sizes
of
curves
and
the
like.
we
also
see
that
this
matter
of
patents
is
exclusely
--
exclusively
within
the
federal
domain,
and
it's
set
down
right
in
the
constitution.
so,
what
we
have
here
is,
where
a
person
who
has
a
meritorious
invention,
where
the
patent
has
been
able
to
run
the
full
length,
the
most
he
can
get
is
17
years.
here
was
an
improvement
not
rising
to
the
dignity
of
invention,
yet,
these
people
have
a
monopoly
in
perpetuity.
so,
it
seems
that
the
--
the
lesser
improvement
merits
the
greater
protection.
day-brite
is
attempting
to
recapture
this
monopoly
that
they
lost
with
the
district
court's
invalidating
this
design
patent
under
the
guise
of
unfair
competition
and
to
stop
compco
from
making
the
precise
thing
that
was
dedicated
to
the
public
by
virtue
of
the
premature
expiration
of
the
design
patent.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
no
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
i
--
i'd
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes.
this
goes
back
quite
a
ways.
we
find,
however,
that
many
people
have
copied
this
particular
fixture,
at
least
nine
as
we
pointed
out.
the
idea
of
having
three
slots
was
quite
popular.
it
seems
that
it
gives
the
best
arrangement
of
uplighting
and
strength
especially
when
you
incorporate
the
ribs
down.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
copying,
we
submit,
can
be
good
or
bad.
it's
sort
of
a
loaded
word.
if
we
wanted
to,
we
could
talk
about
duplication,
product
duplication.
copying,
if
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
copying,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
is
thought
of,
say,
cribbing
from
somebody
else's
examination
paper
in
the
classroom.
now,
that's
--
that's
evil.
that's
bad
as
we
see
it
because
it
permits
the
copyist
to
pass
himself
off
as
something
that
he
really
isn't.
i
mean,
he
represents
to
the
public
that
he's
attained
a
standard
that
he
really
hasn't.
so,
that's
bad.
on
the
other
hand,
a
few
years
ago,
we
had
the
advent
of
the
hula-hoops.
when
they
first
came
out,
they
were
$2
or
$3
a
piece
and
only
children
of
families
of
some
means
could
--
could
afford
them.
but
there
were
a
bunch
of
me-too
items
that
came
out
and
pretty
soon
the
price
was
reduced
to
39
cents,
29
cents.
soon
they
were
given
away
as
premiums
so
that
no
child,
irrespective
of
the
means
of
his
family
was
denied
the
pleasure
of
hula-hooping.
so,
it
depends
upon
the
attitude
that
you
take.
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public,
who
are
interested
in
getting
a
superior
product
at
a
lower
price,
copying
of
a
product
can
be
a
positive
good.
so,
in
that
sense,
we
can
unload
the
word
a
little
bit.
but
what
day-brite
did
here
in
--
oh,
as
far
as
this
unfair
competition
aspect
is
concerned,
it
was
based
--
the
courts
below
based
it
on
the
fact
that
there
was
some
trade
identity
or
identity
to
the
trade
of
this
particular
fixture,
especially
the
reflector
portion
of
it,
that
when
they
saw
that,
they
--
they
thought
of
day-brite
and
it
was
unfair
then
for
somebody
to
trade
on
that
so-called
reputation.
we
would
point
out,
however,
that
they
could
not
have
attained
any
such
reputation
if
there'd
be
such
without
the
help
of
the
patent
because
they
were
constantly
harassing
people
and
driving
them
out
of
the
business.
that
if
they
had
no
patent
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
achieve
whatever
semblance
of
trade
identification
through
this
structure
which
they
say
they
have
and
which
the
courts
below
relied
upon.
they
say
that
these
ribs
function
sort
of
in
the
nature
of
a
trademark.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes
sir?
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
i
would
hate
to
argue
the
case
without
that.
that
--
i
see
that
the
question
that
was
phrased
in
the
outline
does
not
bring
in
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
patent.
in
other
words,
the
question
was,
to
what
extent
did
federal
patent
laws
preclude
manufacture
of
unpatented
product
from
obtaining,
under
states
law
of
unfair
competition,
relief
against
copying
of
the
product?
and
i'd
say
that
the
answer
to
that
must
be
completely
because
this
is
an
area
of
federal
domination.
arguing
it
this
way
even
though
this
is
not
found
in
the
constitution,
the
constitution
says
that
the
congress
shall
reward
inventors.
now,
if
somebody
has
come
along
with
something
that's
less
than
an
invention,
by
virtue
of
answering
this
question
some
other
way,
he
is
then
able
to
get
a
permanent
monopoly
whereas
somebody
who's
come
up
with
something
worthy
is
entitled
to
no
more
than
17
years.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
sir.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
he'd
been
very
hard
put
because
there
were
no
cases
in
illinois
that
have
anything
to
do
with
this.
the
cases
of
all
had
to
do
with
trademarks,
actual
names
such
as
lady
esther,
or
maybe
packages
whether
the
--
they
have
a
particular
stripe
design.
the
law
of
unfair
competition
heretofore
has
had
a
distinct
line
of
demarcation
between
it
and
the
patent
laws
that
when
we
get
down
to
things
or
the
actual
economic
good,
why,
that's
been
something
that's
been
dominated
by
the
--
by
the
federal
laws.
and
i
think
that's
justified
under
the
antitrust
basic
principles
that
we
have
that
we
fear
any
kind
of
a
monopoly
in
a
thing
as
contrasted
to
a
monopoly
in
a
trademark,
a
monopoly
in
the
package
design.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
illinois.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
illinois
law.
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
except
that
the
telling
testimony,
i
don't
think,
could
have
been
adduced
because,
without
a
patent,
if
this
had
been
the
superior
product
that
we
admit
that
it
was,
a
superior
just
to
a
certain
extent,
not
enough
to
enjoy
the
patent
status,
he
could
not
have
kept
others
out
of
the
field.
that
here
was
a
period
of
five
years
or
so
wherein
the
patent
was
used
as
sword
so
as
to
develop
something
that
the
courts
could
rely
upon
as
a
way
of
identifying
the
product
with
a
particular
source.
they
had
in
semi-exclusive
on
this
by
virtue
of
the
patent.
there
were
some
people
who
did
defy
the
patent
and
so
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
let's
see
if
i
get
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
that
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that
would
be
the
law
of
unfair
competition.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
aggravate
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
but,
in
my
presentation
here
i
was
relying
upon
the
aggravated
situation
of
the
fact
that
the
patent
had
been
in
effect.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
but
the
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
but
they
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
well
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
in
--
in
that
respect
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that
to
me
is
clearly
improper
as
far
as
illinois
is
concerned.
and
i
pointed
out
that
illinois
--
the
illinois
courts
speaking
--
the
illinois
law
spoken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
based
that
on
the
fact
that
illinois
courts
thought
that
confusion
of
purchasers
was
the
greatest
evil.
that
if
we
had
two
things,
irrespective
of
patent
coverage,
two
things
that
were
substantially
identical,
why,
the
public
might
be
confused
or
defrauded
thinking
that
they
were
buying
one
when
they
should
have
been
getting
the
other.
and
that
was
the
basis
that
the
illinois
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
decided
this
case
without
considering
at
all
the
patent
aspect.
we
presented
the
question
saying
that
it
was
really
a
question
of
balance
between
two
freedoms,
the
freedom
from
confusion
versus
the
freedom
of
competition
that
the
public
is
interested
--
vitally
interested
in
competition
because
that
tends
to
keep
the
quality
high
while
driving
the
price
down.
in
a
case
like
this
--
and
we
said
that
by
virtue
of
ignoring
that
balance
of
interest,
the
court
arrived
at
the
wrong
conclusion
looking
only
to
the
illinois
law
that
said
that,
"we
don't
we
feel
that
any
of
our
customers
or
any
of
our
citizens
should
be
confused
customers."
that
--
really,
all
that
a
patentee
or
a
former
patentee
in
this
situation
or
for
that
matter,
somebody
in
illinois
who
doesn't
have
a
patent,
should
be
free
against
is
somebody
else
is
making
a
product
and
then
passing
it
off
as
his
own.
in
this
case,
we've
tried
to
avoid
that
because
the
carton
that
it
comes
in
is
prominently
labeled
and
the
fixture
itself
bares
labels
so
that
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
yes,
there
was
that.
that
--
that
they
said,
not
exactly
confusion
of
source,
they
said
that
there
was
actual
confusion.
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
that's
right.
they
--
they
said
in
effect,
that
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
it.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
because
those
findings
do
trouble
us
and
they
trouble
the
solicitor
general
because
he
said
that's
the
difference
these
two
cases.
there's
that
one
finding
in
there
that
i
don't
like.
and
we
say,
the
very
effectiveness
with
which
day-brite
uses
this
patent
permitted
the
court
to
make
that
finding.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
there
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
i
have
about
six
minutes
or
so,
i'd
like
to
reserve
that
for
the
rebuttal.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
excuse
me.
first,
relative
to
the
case
of
mazer
versus
stein
which
had
to
do
with
the
copyright
on
the
lamp-based
statuette
decided
back
in
1953,
mr.
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
copyright.
i
beg
your
--
if
i
didn't
--
if
i
didn't
say
copyright,
i
was
wrong.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
not
a
design
patent.
and
at
page
206,
mr.
justice
reed
in
speaking
for
the
majority
says,
"no
unfair
competition
question
is
presented."
so,
that
has
no
bearing
on
this
case.
they'd
--
the
case
did
say
that
there
maybe
some
conflict
between
design
patents
and
copyrights,
both
of
them
--
both
species
of
industrial
property
going
to
the
ornamental
aspect
but
they
didn't
--
the
court
just
didn't
decide
it
at
that
particular
time.
this
business
of
secondary
meaning
has
been
discussed
at
some
length.
secondary
meaning
has
a
historical
background
relative
to
trademarks.
it
comes
into
focus
primarily
with
word
marks
of
geographical
origin
or
surnames.
60
years
ago,
any
company
in
texas
who
was
drilling
for
oil
could
call
itself
"the
texas
company."
through
long
and
exclusive
identification
with
one
company,
the
outfit
that
makes
the
texaco
products
is
known
as
the
texas
company.
in
the
sphere
of
automobile
manufacturing,
the
surname
ford
has
come
to
mean
a
single
source.
therefore,
there
is
a
secondary
meaning
outside
of
the
usual
surname,
meaning,
for
the
name
ford.
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
as
far
as
secondary
meaning
is
concerned.
it's
something
that's
been
built
up
by
long
and
exclusive
use.
it
has
to
be
exclusive.
mr.
ooms'
point
about
the
coke
bottle,
i
think,
is
well
taken.
that
has
achieved
secondary
meaning,
but
it
is
not
a
thing
that
is
purchased
for
its
own
sake.
you're
buying
the
drink,
the
coca
cola
that's
inside.
so,
therefore,
it's
a
package
dress,
the
same
as
the
trademark.
it
serves
to
identify.
it
isn't
the
--
the
thing
that
you're
buying
as
such
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
statement
that
what
is
being
counseled
here
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
no,
we
say
it's
out
of
step
with
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
says
that
monopolies
in
things
or
goods
are
intolerable
--
i
beg
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
but
here
we're
talking
--
let's
get
back
to
the
coke
bottle
in
contrast
to
this.
there
is
a
shape
on
the
bottle
that
is
distinct
that
we
can
see
or
the
haig
and
haig
pinch
bottle.
i
mean,
we
can
see
that
at
a
glance
but
we're
not
buying
that
product
for
the
bottle.
we're
not
going
to
use
the
bottle
ordinarily.
we're
going
to
use
the
--
the
contents
of
it.
here,
we
are
actually
using
this
reflector
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
identifying
feature.
this
is
the
thing.
this
is
not
something
that's
been
added
as
an
overlay
or
a
stamping
on
it
just
to
identify
it
with
a
--
with
a
certain
producer.
so
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that's
a
difficult
question
to
ask
in
view
of
the
holding
in
illinois
because
certain
states
still
say
that
there
has
to
be
direct
competition.
in
this
lady
esther
case
in
illinois,
probably
coca
cola
would
be
able
to
restrain
you
under
that
basis
because,
here,
the
cosmetician,
the
maker
of
cosmetics,
was
able
to
restrain
a
person
who
was
selling
corsets
under
the
name
lady
esther.
they
said
there
were
some
relationship
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
that
--
may
--
maybe
yours
is
far
enough
away
that
we
wouldn't
do
that.
mr.
ooms
brought
up
the
point
of
the
owner
of
the
factory
going
into
the
store
and
seeing
one
of
these
fixtures.
the
thing
that's
complained
of,
of
course,
is
the
activity
of
our
people
that
we
make
it
possible
for
some
hanky
panky
to
be
carried
out.
so,
we
refer
to
the
testimony
of
the
person
who's
in
charge
of
the
selling
of
the
compco
fixtures
and
he
says,
the
--
this
is
at
page
206
of
the
record,
"the
contractor
would
purchase
these
the
same
way.
he
would
look
at
samples.
he
would
examine
them.
he
would
look
at
catalog
sheets.
of
course,
first,
he
might
--
he
would
look
at
the
catalog
sheet
to
determine
which
samples
he
would
like
to
examine."
so,
this
is
a
discriminating
class
of
purchasers,
people
who
buy
in
quantity.
the
one
case
of
actual
confusion
that
was
talked
about,
there
were
573
compco
fixtures
mounted
in
the
factory
ceiling
at
about
$20
a
piece,
that's
well
over
a
$10,000
sale
that,
in
a
case
like
that,
people
are
going
to
look
at
the
product
pretty
carefully
so,
finding
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
because
some
workman
decided
that
he
should
call
up
day-brite
rather
than
compco
to
come
and
repair
these
fixtures.
he
--
that's
true.
he
didn't
climb
up
on
a
ladder
and
look
to
see
which
these
were
because
there
were
some
day-brite
fixtures
in
the
cafeteria
which
were
8-feet
high
and
which
he
could
see,
whereas,
these
were
15
to
20
feet
high.
so,
we
don't
know
just
the
reason
for
--
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
jerome
f.
fallon
but,
on
the
other
hand,
that
is
the
only
instance
of
confusion.
it
wasn't
purchaser
confusing.
it
was
the
confusion
of
somebody
who
was
delegated
with
maintaining
these
in
proper
working
order.
