justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
the
question
please?
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
matter
of
the
usefulness
of
the
informant's
name
for
purposes
of
the
trial,
i'm
talking
only
about
the
probable
cause
matter.
i
take
that
your
position
is
that
if
you
--
what
the
--
if
the
defendant
suggests
that
the
officer
who
gave
the
affidavit
was
not
in
good
faith
or
was
lying
that
in
--
in
any
situation
like
that,
you're
entitled
to
the
informant's
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
i
take
in
it
that
that
--
what
this
may
--
you're
suggesting
and
there
should
be
no
informant's
privilege
in
connection
with
a
--
a
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
you
have
to
do
in
any
case,
to
say,
we
suggest
that
the
officer
really
presented
a
phony
affidavit
and
that's
all
you
have
to
suggest
and
you're
entitled
to
the
informant's
name
to
prove
that
he
wasn't
--
to
prove
that
he
--
was
or
was
not
lying.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
on
the
part
of
the
--
not
on
the
part
of
the
officer
who
gave
the
affidavit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
well,
then
you
don't
suggest
that
just
the
--
what
you
say
is
that
you
must
first
demonstrate
some
factual
inaccuracies
in
the
affidavit
before
you're
entitled
to
the
informant's
name
as
a
matter
of
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
should
be
no
informant's
privilege
in
fourth
amendment
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand.
but
now,
how
about
the
trial?
aren't
--
isn't
your
position
about
to
say
and
about
the
trial
in
any
case
where
the
government
says
a
confidential
informant
says,
"he
saw
something
or
did
something,
or
heard
something,
you
could
make
--
a
defendant
could
make
precisely
the
claim
you're
making
here,
that
we
don't
know
who
he
was
and
consequently
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
a
participant
in
the
crime
or
not
and
consequently
he
may,
very
well
may
know
facts
about
this
case
pertinent
to
our
defense."
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
just
about
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
until
you
know
the
name
--
until
you
know
the
name,
you
don't
know
whether
he
was
a
confederate
or
--
or
not,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
relevant
to
your
--
to
your
use
of
the
trial
points.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
it's
true
that
the
--
that
the
confidential
informant
whoever
he
might
be,
his
information
might
be
completely
irrelevant
to
your
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it
were
either
--
there
are
very
--
let's
assume
that
the
neighbor
lady
--
assume
the
informant
was
the
neighbor
who
had
a
key
to
the
house
while
rugendorfs
were
away
and
she
just
said,
"i
was
a
little
nosey
and
--
and
looked
on
his
closet,
in
the
basement."
now
if
that's
what
you
found
out
when
you
--
when
you
were
given
the
informant's
name,
it
probably
wouldn't
be
very
useful
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
possibility,
i
should
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
would
be
true
--
this
would
be
true
in
every
informant's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
be
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
think
of
a
case
where
there's
a
confidential
informant
has
--
has
resulted
in
the
arrest
of
a
man
that
--
that
you
couldn't
say
exactly
what
you're
saying
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
in
--
in
connection
with
the
preparation
for
trial
in
any
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
need
the
name
of
the
informant.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
purport
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
one
case
and
another
insofar
as
--
as
when
you
need
a
confidential
informant
or
not?
in
all
of
cases,
you
would
--
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
need
to
know
the
name
at
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
mr.
acheson,
if
there's
an
evidence
of
the
hearings
to
suppress
that
the
agent
said
that
an
informer
had
told
him
something
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
informant
had
not
told
him
something.
it's
not
whether
the
facts
of
the
informant
said
they're
true
or
false.
the
fact
is
that
the
agent
misstated
what
the
informant
told
him.
that's
what's
wrong
--
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
it's
not
only
that
there
are
factual
inaccuracies
but
the
--
that
the
affiant
said
that
an
informant
had
told
him
something
that
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
--
the
affidavit
is
inaccurate
and
that
--
and
that
the
agent
said,
he
had
learned
it
from
a
certain
source
and
that
he
had
not
learned
it
from
a
certain
sources.
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
a
matter
over
and
above
where
there's
a
factual
inaccuracy
and
what
the
--
what
--
what
the
--
what
an
informant
might
have
said
that
i
think
would
be
recurring.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't.
that
isn't
what
happened.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
--
the
question
is
--
when
you
answer
mr.
justice
black
that
you
--
that
you
stand
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit,
certainly
as
it
regards
the
--
if
this
petitioner
had
--
had
been
able
to
show
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
agent
lied,
knowingly
lied
substantially
in
the
affidavit,
i
suppose
the
--
you
would
conceive
that
they
might
be
entitled
to
the
name
of
the
informant.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
defendant
has
to
make
when
there's
been
a
confidential
information
used
for
a
search
warrant.
what
kind
of
a
showing
does
he
have
to
make
before
he's
entitled
to
that
name
because
it
would
be
useful
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
on
this
particular
case,
you
can
--
you
can
imagine
that
--
that
if
that
--
the
confidential
informant
was
a
participant
in
the
crime
or
was
a
colleague
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
the
thieves
or
one
of
those
thieves
themselves
that
--
that
the
defendant
might
very
easily
had
used
that
confidential
informant
to
show
that
the
defendant
wasn't
involved
in
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
first
a
--
why
in
this
case
wouldn't
the
name
--
wouldn't
the
informant
be
useful
to
the
defendant
in
his
--
in
connection
with
his
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
--
is
to
say
that
the
affiant
was
lying
and
then
you're
entitled
to
the
confidential
informant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
prove
it
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
independent
evidence.
