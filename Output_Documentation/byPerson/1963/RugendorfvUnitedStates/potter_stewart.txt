justice
potter
stewart
so
what
are
you
addressing
this
discussion
to,
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
bothers
me
a
little
bit
is
this
and
it's
maybe
that
i
don't
fully
understand
the
scope
and
thrust
of
your
argument.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
basic
and
separate
points
here,
one
is
the
--
one
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
and
a
valid
warrant
to
conduct
the
search
and
the
search
was
made
and
did
in
fact
disclose
that
there
were
81
stolen
fur
coats
in
this
man's
house.
that
--
that
face
of
the
case
involves
a
set
of
issues.
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
the
question
of
probable
cause
and
--
and
also
the
basic
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
identity
of
the
informant
should
have
been
disclosed.
but
then
quite
a
different
and
separate
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
probative
value
of
the
facts
that
these
fur
coats
had
been
found
in
this
man's
house
in
his
prosecution
at
the
criminal
trial
and
as
--
i
have
difficulty
when
you
mix
them
all
up
because
it
seem
--
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
discrete
issues.
justice
potter
stewart
actually
mr.
acheson
and
i
guess
that's
just
what
you
just
now
suggested,
that
the
--
the
last
two
paragraphs
of
the
affidavit
are
--
would
be
sufficient
to
support
a
search
warrant,
wouldn't
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
had
this
detail
in
the
earlier
part.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
last
two
paragraphs
would
be
sufficient
to
support
a
valid
search
warrant
and
if
the
inaccuracies
in
the
earlier
paragraphs
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
then
those
inaccuracy
just
drop
out
of
the
case,
don't
they?
