not
at
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
now
that
the
--
there
was
an
independent
proceeding
on
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
conclusion
of
that
proceeding
of
the
trial
judge
denied
the
application
for
names
of
the
informant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
the
very
question
if
the
affiant
as
to
the
earlier
statements,
you'd
know
they
dropped
out
of
the
state
out
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
those
statements
are
proved
unreliable
then
at
least
doesn't
the
question
raised
whether
the
last
two
paragraphs
may
not
also
be
unreliable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
it
hasn't
--
i
agree
it
hasn't
but
if
he
was
not,
my
suggestion
is,
may
it
not
go
to
the
credibility
of
the
last
two
paragraphs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
least
justify
an
insistence
that
since
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
two
are
not
to
be
credited,
that
the
informant
ought
to
be
produced.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
reasonable
and
a
good
answer.
that's
to
say
that
there's
nothing
enough
--
enough
here
to
question
the
credibility
to
be
given
the
last
two
paragraphs
in
the
circumstances
but
i
should
be
thinking
it
follow
that
maybe
because
there
is
a
paragraph
standing
alone
that
if
credited,
would
support
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
--
i
thought
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
didn't
kelleher
testified
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
had
not
told
somebody
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
so
to
that
extent,
when
the
affiant
says
that
kelleher
told
you
that's
not
true,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
go
on
this
part
as
to
say
is
that
--
as
to
say
that
what
would
put
this
burden
on
the
government
or
destroy
underlying
--
probable
cause,
would
not
be
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
things
allegedly
said
by
the
informant,
but
whether
in
fact
the
informant
had
said
those
things
to
the
affiant,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
that
the
affiant
lied
when
he
said
that
keller
--
kelleher
told
him
the
story,
whatever
the
story.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
does
not
involve
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
thing
said
to
have
been
told
him,
namely,
that
he
saw
somebody
in
the
meat
market.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
would
not
take
the
act,
you
would
take
the
situation
as
mr.
justice
black
is
suggesting
that
some
states
do
but
you
can't
go
behind
the
affidavit
that
the
magistrate
acted
upon
but
if
the
affiant
lied
in
anything
he
said,
you
prosecute
him
for
perjury.
but
you
go
beyond
that
you've
--
you've
said
it,
that
if
you
had
proved
that
the
affiant
lied,
that
maybe
a
basis
for
find
--
a
holding
that
probable
cause
collapsed.
