justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
sufficiency
of
the
probable
cause
is
to
be
determined
by
other
evidence
taken
later
that
you
go
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit
of
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
try
out
the
truthfulness
of
the
facts
sworn
to
and
warrant
affidavit,
you
try
out
the
truthfulness
of
those
facts
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
warrant
was
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
see
that
that
justifies
on
separate
court
trial
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statements
was
made
in
an
affidavit
were
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
pearce,
you
just
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
control
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
the
principle
of
law
stated
and
as
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
that.
i
was
talking
about
whether
you
can
try
out
the
facts,
disputed
facts
to
see
whether
or
not
the
facts
alleged
upon
which
an
affiant
based
his
conclusions
were
true
or
false.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
get
--
so
as
i'm
not
to
get
fairly
--
yet
fairly
understand
what
concession
the
government
is
making.
of
course,
when
there
is
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
taken
before
magistrate,
the
judge
has
to
hear
the
facts,
listen
to
testimony
and
get
the
facts
and
get
evidence.
constitutional
provision,
however,
is
that
it
shall
not
be
made
without
a
warrant
by
magistrate.
now,
when
costello,
we
held
that
you
could
not
go
behind
the
facts
in
indictment
to
try
out
the
issues
to
where
the
grand
jury
should
have
indicted.
are
you
conceding
here
that
when
a
warrant
is
issued
by
a
magistrate
upon
facts
that
are
alleged
that
the
defendant
can
go
behind
that
reviewed
to
see
whether
or
not
the
magistrate
had
the
power
to
do
that
are
and
on
the
other
hand,
here
evidenced,
new
evidence?
a
motion
is
challenge
--
challenging
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
in
here,
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
man
who
made
the
affidavit
testified
truthfully
or
falsely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
based
on
an
affidavit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
let's
suppose
he
did.
let's
suppose
--
let's
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
will
the
government
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose,
i'm
talking
about
the
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
it
rest
upon
probably
cause
on
affidavit
of
probable
cause
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
satisfactory
to
the
magistrate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
this
court
ever
held,
it
maybe
it
has,
i
was
looking
into
brief.
had
this
court
ever
held
that
you
can
try
out
anew
to
determine
differently
to
the
magistrate
on
the
affidavit
given
there
that
in
reality
there
was
no
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
disclosing
with
that
informant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
conceding
from
that
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
trial
in
advance
of
the
trial,
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
magistrate
should've
denied
that
on
the
ground
that
he
has
more
facts,
he
would've
known
that
the
man
was
testifying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
i'm
asking
you
this
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
general
rule
is,
in
most
of
states
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
i
don't
know
that
we've
passed
on
it
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
warrant
issued
by
the
magistrate
is
determined
not
be
what
the
actual
truth
is
with
reference
to
it,
but
whether
taking
that
as
true
which
the
magistrate
accepted
as
true,
that
name
of
the
affidavit,
that
was
probable
cause
to
issue
the
warrant.
otherwise,
you'd
have
two-trial
such
as
we
said
in
costello
would
not
be
committed
--
permitted
in
connection
with
the
attacking
an
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
different
kinds
of
motion
to
suppress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
their
motions
to
suppress,
where
there
has
been
no
warrant
issued,
no
affidavit
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
their
motions
to
suppress
everyday.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
inquiry
that
i
have
in
mind.
that's
why
i
was
trying
to
find
if
the
government
thought
it
was
answered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
this
court
held
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
necessary
suggested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
very
important
statement
you're
making
with
reference
to
the
law.
maybe
the
courts
held
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
under
which
for
this
preliminary
part
of
the
prosecution,
the
search
warrant
shall
not
be
issued
and
that
arrest
shall
not
be
made.
it
--
it
then
go
to
the
merits
of
the
trial.
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
you
can
--
you
can
charge
him
with
an
offense
and
arrest
him
or
have
a
search
warrant.
and
that
it
might
--
it
has
been
argued
and
as
i
think,
the
rule
is
the
motion
of
state.
if
the
constitutional
provision
authorizes
that,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
action
of
the
magistrate
so
far
as
that
preliminary
conduct
is
concerned,
is
final.
and
you
are
saying
it
on
the
basis
that
you
think
that's
unconscionable,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
could
be
challenged
but
where
are
you
cases?
do
we
have
any
cases
that
have
said
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
has
been
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
try
to
safeguard
against
the
risk
and
system
has
been
provided,
whereby
affidavit
--
upon
affidavit,
a
magistrate
will
have
the
authority
to
decide
that
question.
that's
--
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
and
if
he's
decided
it
and
it
maybe
true
that
i'm
not
--
i
have
not
said
that
i
would
not
so
hold,
it
maybe
true
that
you
can
by
reason
of
making
it
to
this
degree
or
that
degree
wrong,
i
doubted
it,
that's
right
if
we
should
draw
degree
then
i
think
that
it's
open
challenge,
it
ought
to
be
open
to
challenge
and
let
it
be
tried
over,
but
it
--
that's
a
lot
of
delay
but
that's
alright,
if
that's
what
the
--
what
--
what
the
law
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
not
--
i
can't
draw
that
distinction
about
confidential
informant
myself.
the
--
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
the
protection
offered
by
the
fifth
amendment
--
by
--
by
the
amendment
which
provide
to
get
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
intended
to
provide
the
system
whereby
the
magistrate
has
a
duty,
expressed
duty,
the
--
have
something
proven
to
his
--
that
it
did
give
probable
cause.
that's
a
preliminary
step
in
a
prosecution.
and
whether
that's
to
be
thrown
off,
to
be
tried
in
every
--
to
--
to
challenge
every
search
warrant
and
every
warrant
on
the
ground,
well
if
this
man
didn't
testify
the
truth
to
the
magistrate
or
whether
his
judgment
about
that
is
final
so
far
as
the
issues
of
the
warrant
is
concerned.
you
see,
when
you
get
them
that
--
that
--
that's
required
as
we
said,
costello
would
be
to
challenge
the
indictment,
open
up
warrant
of
arrest
in
order
to
have
a
trial
on
that
issue
again
or
you'll
never
positively
get
to
the
trial
of
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
one
which
you
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
have
just
read
it
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
it
quite
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
find
any,
would
you
send
them
in
too.
