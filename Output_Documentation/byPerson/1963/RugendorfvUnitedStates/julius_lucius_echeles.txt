mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
mr.
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
this
court.
your
honors
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
--
an
affirmance
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
held
first
that
the
name
of
a
confidential
informant
in
a
--
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
need
never
be
disclosed
in
a
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
requires
disclosure
because
he
is
asserting
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
second,
said
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
"in
any
event,
such
disclosure
need
never
be
made
unless
the
defendant
can
show
that
the
informant
was
present
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
and
indeed
that
he
was
the
moving
party
in
the
commission
of
the
offense.
those
are
difficult
and
disturbing
questions
here
for
the
--
this
court
to
decide.
it
is
as
disturbing
the
conviction
as
i
have
ever
encountered.
for
not
only
is
the
continuing
viability
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
at
state
here
in
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
but
the
petitioner
himself
stands
burdened
by
a
conviction
for
which
he
has
received
a
sentence
of
10
years
imprisonment.
on
the
product
of
conjecture
which
is
a
word
used
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
conjecture
as
to
whether
or
not
the
informant
might
have
helped
him
to
exonerate
himself
from
the
accusation
of
the
government.
a
third
issue
is
at
state
here
because
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
not
limited
to
the
points
raised
in
the
petition
and
that
is
under
the
circumstances
here,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
upon
which
to
predicate
the
conviction,
a
conviction
of
possession
of
stolen
property
moving
in
interstate
commerce,
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
the
grant
was
limited
to
the
questions
in
the
petition
that
these
are
the
three
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
these
are
the
three
questions.
one
of
the
questions
was
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
coming
to
the
last
point
first,
whether
or
not,
under
circumstances
such
as
here,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
connection.
the
facts
are
rather
simple
and
essentially
are
not
in
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
petitioner.
petitioner
was
55
years
of
age,
married,
lived
with
his
wife
in
a
family
owned
home.
he
and
his
wife
owned
a
home
on
the
north
side
of
chicago.
he
owned
a
grocery
store
and
a
meat
market
and
his
hours
of
activity
were
from
5:30
in
the
morning
when
he
got
up
until
about
7:30
or
8:30
at
night
when
he
came
home.
on
a
day
in
question,
march
22,
1962,
the
fbi
agents
in
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant
previously
obtained
from
a
commissioner
in
chicago,
executing
a
search
warrant,
went
to
the
basement
of
the
home
of
the
rugendorfs
and
in
closets
in
the
basement,
found
81
furs
which
were
subsequently
identified
as
having
been
stolen
in
two
burglaries.
one
in
shreveport,
louisiana
in
december
of
1961
and
the
other
in
mountain
brook,
alabama
in
january
of
1961.
based
on
those
facts
and
those
facts
alone,
rugendorf
was
convicted
because
furs
were
found
in
his
home,
in
the
basement
in
his
home.
there
was
no
evidence
that
rugendorf
himself
knew
of
the
existence
of
furs.
there
was
no
evidence
by
the
government
that
he
as
much
suspicioned
the
existence
of
the
stolen
furs
in
his
basement.
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant
obtained
by
an
fbi
affiant
revealed
that
sam
rugendorf,
petitioner
here,
had
a
brother,
leo
rugendorf.
and
that
from
the
facts
as
brought
out
both
in
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
in
the
affidavit
itself
that
leo
rugendorf,
brother
of
sam,
was
a
known
fence,
receiver
of
stolen
property
and
that
he,
leo,
was
associated
with
certain
known
thieves
identified
in
the
affidavit.
and
that
these
thieves
were
the
ones,
according
to
the
confidential
informants,
who
had
committed
the
burglaries
in
alabama
and
in
mountain
brook,
but
not
a
word
either
in
the
affidavit
or
during
the
trial
or
during
the
hearing
on
the
motions
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
sam
rugendorf
had
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
furs.
therefore,
the
government's
theory
was
that
rugendorf
was
guilty
because
he
was
in
constructive
possession
of
the
furs.
but
even
if
one
is
in
constructive
possession
of
stolen
property,
the
next
fact
has
to
be
decided
from
naked
constructive
possession
of
stolen
property
thus,
knowledge
of
the
stolen
content
of
those
items
become
chargeable
to
the
constructive
possessor
by
inference.
there
is
no
single
case
decided
by
this
court
which
decides
that
constructive
possession
gives
rise
to
a
further
inference
that
the
possessor
posses
them
knowing
the
same
to
have
been
stolen.
there
is
one
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
russo,
which
we
cite,
which
states
that
under
circumstances
such
as
this,
he
cannot
pile
the
inference
upon
the
inference
and
the
presumption
upon
the
presumption,
and
that
conclude
guilty
knowledge.
with
respect
to
the
other
matters
raised
in
the
petition,
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
some
dicta
in
roviaro
case,
in
this
court's
roviaro
case,
which
apparently
is
interpreted
differently
by
different
circuits,
the
ninth
circuit
in
costello,
interpreted
roviaro
as
requiring
disclosure
of
confidential
informant
were
unnecessary
in
a
proceeding
attacking
the
search
warrant.
the
fourth
circuit,
the
winding
case
followed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case,
decided
that
in
the
proceeding
where
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
issue,
where
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
under
the
fourth
amendment
are
at
stake
that
he
may
not
obtain
the
benefit
of
disclosure
even
where
disclosure
would
be
helpful
and
relevant
to
the
defense
and
even
where
the
disclosure
is
essential
to
a
fair
determination
of
the
cause.
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case,
that
is
a
case
and
that
is
a
point,
a
first
impression
before
this
court,
roviaro
did
not
decide
that
point
at
all
and
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
gone
off
on
dicta
in
the
case.
roviaro
was
a
factual
situation
in
which
a
--
in
a
narcotic
case,
the
so-called
informant
was
with,
according
to
the
government,
was
with
the
seller
of
narcotics
to
a
police
officer.
there
was
no
issue
in
the
roviaro
case
of
search
warrant,
of
demand
in
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
there
is
no
case
decided
by
this
court
previous
to
roviaro
which
has
it.
and
as
i
say,
the
several
circuits
have
a
different
play.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
is
less
important
when
one
asserts
his
right
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
then
according
to
the
seventh
circuit
--
according
to
the
fourth
circuit,
cannot
get
information
helpful
in
showing
the
invalidity
of
the
search
warrant
than
it
--
then
it
is,
if
he
needs
that
information
which
is
essential
to
his
case
in
chief.
because
then
the
courts
of
appeals
are
downgrading
the
viability,
the
effectiveness
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
what
they
are
saying
is
that
you
may
not
try
to
show
invalidity
in
a
search
warrant
because
the
government's
privilege
to
secrete
the
name
of
the
informer
is
more
important.
well,
that
poses
a
difficult
question
and
a
difficult
situation
for
a
defendant
who
as
in
the
--
in
this
instance
claimed
at
the
trial,
claimed
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
claimed
at
the
trial,
claimed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
complete
innocence,
complete
absence
of
any
connection
with
any
of
the
details
of
the
crime.
he
only
owned
a
house
in
which
there
were
furs
found
in
the
basement.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
he
was
at
his
store,
working
in
his
store
on
the
south
side
of
chicago.
the
raid
was
made,
that
is
the
entry
into
the
house,
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant
was
made
around
5:00
or
5:15
p.m.
on
march
22,
1962.
by
some
telephone
calls
and
some
signals,
the
fbi
raiders
called
their
office
who
contacted
agents
in
the
field
who
were
then
on
their
automobiles
and
then
the
two
agents
went
to
--
not
the
place
where
sam
rugendorf
owned
his
store,
but
went
to
another
store,
rugendorf
brothers
meat
market,
which
in
the
affidavit
was
alleged
to
have
been
managed
by
sam.
that
information
was
false,
we
demonstrated
and
that
information
allegedly
came
from
a
confidential
informant
previously
known
to
have
been
informed.
the
agents
did
not
find
sam
rugendorf
at
the
rugendorf
brothers
meat
market
where
it
was
alleged
in
the
affidavit.
he
was
the
manager,
excuse
me,
but
ascertained
that
he
owned
the
store
some
miles
distance
about
two
or
two
and
a
half
miles
away,
they
went
to
the
store
and
they
arrested
sam
rugendorf
at
about
6:00
or
6:15
p.m.
on
that
night.
he
was
at
work.
he
denied
any
knowledge,
acquaintanceship
or
connection
with
the
furs.
he
expressed
surprise,
indignant
surprise.
the
--
and
that
is
the
only
connection
that
the
government
has
made
with
sam
rugendorf
that
he
had
a
consanguinary
relationship
with
his
brother,
and
that
the
old
law
of
blood
tincture,
the
old
english
law
of
blood
tincture,
has
now
come
to
play
in
this
case
because
sam
is
hoist
in
this
conviction
only
because
he
was
leo's
brother.
how
did
the
furs
come
to
be
in
the
basement?
that
is
conjectural.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
wanted
to
have
the
identity
of
the
confidential
informant.
the
evidence
shows
without
contradiction
by
the
government
that
sam
and
his
wife,
belle,
went
to
florida
on
a
vacation
on
february
the
17th,
1962.
they
lived
in
the
house
alone.
they
gave
their
key,
that
is
sam
gave
his
key,
to
a
neighbor
two
doors
down
a
pharmacist
by
the
name
of
rosen,
he
gave
the
key
to
this
house
to
his
sister,
he
gave
the
key
to
his
house
to
his
son
and
gave
the
key
to
his
house
upon
request
to
leo
rugendorf,
his
brother,
for
the
purpose
of
watching
the
house
in
their
absence,
cleaning
the
walk
from
snow,
observing
that
the
house
is
taken
cared
of,
keeping
the
heat
up
in
the
two
weeks
absence.
sam
rugendorf
and
his
wife
returned
to
chicago
on
march
the
4,
1962,
came
to
the
house.
he
testified
that
he'd
never
went
into
the
basement
during
--
between
the
time
of
march
4,
1962,
they
returned
to
chicago
and
the
time
of
his
arrest
on
march
22,
1962
because
he
had
no
reason
to
go
into
the
basement.
he
testified
without
contradiction
that
the
house
was
heated
by
gas,
that
the
thermostats
controlling
the
gas
heat
was
in
the
living
room
and
he
had
no
reason
to
go
into
the
basement
that
is
hours
in
taking
care
of
the
store,
consumed
seven
days
of
his
week.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
well,
i
have
finished
that
phase
of
it
to
the
necessity.
i
now
address
myself
to
your
honors,
to
the
necessity
and
requirement
that
sam
had
in
obtaining
some
information
from
the
informant
in
order
to
aid
him
in
presenting
to
the
jury,
facts
to
show
his
innocence
or
facts
to
show
reasonable
doubt
or
facts
to
show
the
seeds
of
innocence,
facts
to
show
seeds
of
substantial
doubt
and
we
even
challenged
the
trial
courts,
mr.
justice,
that
if
the
informant
came
forward,
it
might
even
aid
the
government
in
proof
of
guilt
against
sam,
but
sam
was
now
worried
about,
he
having
consummate
belief
in
his
innocence.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
relating
only
then
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
search
warrant
and
to
the
requirement
and
the
necessity
for
the
informant
to
disprove
the
efficacy
of
the
search
warrant,
the
following
where
the
facts
disclosed
in
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
there
were
in
the
affidavit
a
number
of
items
set
out
by
the
agent
affiant
as
attending
to
disclose
to
the
commissioner
issuing
the
warrant
that
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
upon
hearing,
it
was
demonstrated
that
facts
which
the
agent
affiant
allegedly
got
from
his
confidential
informant
previously
known
to
have
been
reliable
to
him,
were
false
in
some
respects.
it
was
shown
to
have
been
false
that
when
the
agent
informant
said
that
he
received
information
that
sam
rugendorf
was
the
manager
of
rugendorf
brothers
meat
market
that
that
information
was
false.
it
was
false
in
another
and
even
more
important
respect.
agent
moore,
the
affiant
agent,
stated
that
he
received
information
from
agent
mccormick
naming
his
informant
this
time
that
agent
mccormick
told
him
that
a
chicago
police
officer,
kelleher,
told
him
that
sam
rugendorf
managed
--
that
sam
rugendorf
managed
the
rugendorf
brothers
meat
market.
that
was
false
because
officer
kelleher
took
the
stand,
if
this
court
please
and
said
that
he
did
not
tell
agent
mccormick
that
sam
rugendorf
managed
the
--
the
store.
well,
if
those
facts
were
false
and
there
were
no
other
facts
of
which
sam
rugendorf
could
dispose
were
false,
that
is,
he
did
not
contend
that
there
was
no
burglary
in
alabama
or
louisiana.
he
had
no
knowledge
of
that.
he
did
not
contend
that
the
furs
were
not
transported.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
alleged
corroboration
within
the
agent
affiant's
knowledge
that
he
said
he
had,
was
proven
to
be
weakened
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he,
the
agent
affiant
said,
within
the
last
six
months
prior
to
the
--
he's
making
the
affidavit,
all
burglaries
of
furs
in
the
united
states
over
the
amount
of
$5000
are
reported
to
the
fbi
and
he
reviewed
the
files
of
the
fbi
and
he
discovered
that
there
was
only
one
burglary
in
the
united
states
fitting
the
description
of
furs.
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
trial,
there
were
two
such
burglaries
fitting
the
description,
the
one
in
shreveport,
louisiana
and
the
one
in
mountain
brook,
alabama.
however,
your
honor,
the
informer
issue
is
not
limited
to
the
search
warrant
issue
alone.
that
is,
your
honor,
is
right.
i'm
sort
of
arguing
and
the
arguments
do
overlap
into
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
informant
identity
and
information
that
we
might
have
obtained
from
the
informant
was
necessary
in
the
defense
in
chief
because
information
from
the
informant
certainly
would
have
been
helpful,
relevant.
it
certainly
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
a
fair
determination
of
the
issues
in
this
cause.
the
language
used
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
we
first
demanded
knowledge
of
the
identity
with
the
opening
of
the
trial
before
any
evidence
was
presented.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
this
was
the
--
this
was
the
manner
by
which
the
court
decided
the
motion
to
suppress
should
be
heard.
before
--
we
presented
the
written
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
advance
of
the
trial
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
preliminary
to
any
decision
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
when
we
should
have
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
demand
was
made
for
the
informant.
that's
on
page
13
of
the
transcript,
mr.
justice
brennan.
at
--
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
in
advance
of
the
prosecution
presenting
any
evidence,
we
made
a
demand
upon
the
government
for
the
names
of
the
informers.
and
we
stated
that
the
names
of
the
informants
are
necessary
to
a
proper
defense
or
a
proper
presentation
of
the
defendant's
case
in
attacking
the
search
warrant.
then
followed
the
long
colloquy
between
the
court
and
defense
counsel
with
respect
to
the
necessity
for
the
revelation
of
the
confidential
informant
and
the
only
reason,
the
only
reason
advanced
by
the
government
in
the
trial
was
not
that
revelation
of
identity
was
not
necessary
or
relevant,
that
was
not
the
reason
that
they
gave.
the
reason
that
the
government
gave
and
the
only
reason
articulated
throughout
the
trial
was
that,
revelation
of
the
informant
might
possibly
lead
to
the
informant's
demise.
the
trial
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
the
trial
--
no,
your
honor,
he
did
it
in
advance
of
the
trial
when
demand
was
made,
he
denied,
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
he
did
it
again
--
yes,
your
honor.
he
did
it
during
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
he
denied
the
demands.
he
did
it
in
both
instances.
the
procedure
by
which
the
trial
judge
adapted,
he
decided
to
hear
the
evidence
in
chief
first
and
to
withhold
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
until
the
government
presented
the
evidence.
so
after
the
jury
was
selected,
agent
moore
testified
without
too
much
cross-examination
or
any,
that
he
executed
the
search
warrant,
that
he
found
the
furs.
then
the
government
made
its
offer
into
evidence
of
the
81
furs.
there
was
an
objection
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
illegally
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
then
the
hearing
was
held
on
the
motion
to
suppress
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
it
was
during
that
motion
that
demand
for
the
informants
was
renewed
and
renewed
repeatedly,
renewed
as
vigorously
as
a
defense
counsel
can
until
the
judge
foreclosed
any
further
questioning
and
stated
that
he
foreclosed
further
questioning.
now,
why
was
it
necessary
to
have
the
--
the
informant?
because
under
circumstances
such
as
these,
where
sam
rugendorf
was
innocent
or
claimed
innocence
and
has
no
knowledge
of
the
activities
of
an
informant,
it
becomes
more
difficult,
it
becomes
practically
an
impossible
task
to
require
him
to
demonstrate
as
the
court
of
appeals
opined
that
he
must
demonstrate
that
the
informants
--
thank
you.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
may
it
please
the
court.
the
dicta
that
i
referred
to
in
roviaro
was
really
unwritten,
unspoken
dicta.
i
do
not
mean
by
another
dicta
in
language
of
roviaro
because
roviaro
only
had,
for
consideration,
the
determination
of
whether
or
not,
disclosure
of
informant
is
required
under
those
factual
situations.
search
warrant
was
not
involved.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
off
because
search
warrant
was
not
involved
to
determine
that
only
when
it
is
necessary
and
relevant
to
the
defense
in
the
case
was
disclosure
compelled
and
that
is
what
i
meant
to
say
although
i
stated
it
rather
badly.
the
government
in
this
case
has
shifted
its
position
with
respect
to
the
demand
for
the
relevant
information
of
the
informant
at
every
level
of
this
case.
in
the
trial
court,
the
only
reason
the
government
came
for
failure
to
disclose
is
not
that
the
information
would
not
be
either
relevant
or
helpful
or
necessary
for
a
fair
consideration
of
the
case,
but
because
the
information
might
possibly
lead
to
the
death
of
the
informant.
on
the
court
of
appeals'
level,
the
brief
written
by
the
government
stated
that,
"it
is
only
where
it
is
essential
to
the
individual's
right
to
prepare
his
defense
that
we're
entitled
to
the
information."
they
abandoned
their
early
position.
before
this
court,
in
its
brief,
the
government
has
taken
a
third
position
shifting
again,
stating
that
it
abandoned
its
earlier
contention
that
disclosure
is
appropriate
only
where
the
--
the
--
the
informant
is
first
proven
to
have
been
the
moving
party
in
the
commission
of
offense
and
participated
in
the
offense.
they
abandoned
the
--
the
contention
that
information
may
not
be
disclosed
only
where
it
is
relevant
to
an
impeachment
of
the
search
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
they
now
say
that
the
defendant
must
demonstrate
fraud
in
the
warrant.
they
don't
say
they
we're
not
entitled
to
it
at
all
but
we
--
but
if
we
demonstrate
fraud,
we
might
possibly
get
the
information.
they,
then
in
this
court,
suggest
that
no
fraud
was
committed
upon
the
magistrate
because
the
magistrate
heard
from
policeman
a
who
said
he
got
it
from
policeman
b
and
if
even
policeman
b
was
lying,
that
didn't
make
policeman
a
affiant
agent
of
the
liar
necessarily
and
with
respect
to
the
final
contention
of
the
government,
they
state
that
--
and
they
abandoned
all
of
the
positions
and
they
state
that
under
roviaro,
the
defendant
rugendorf,
might
have
been
entitled
to
relevant
information
about
the
informant
had
we
presented
that
information
properly
in
the
trial
court.
well,
we
presented
it
as
repeatedly
and
as
vigorously
and
as
forcefully
as
we
could
until
we
were
foreclosed
from
the
trial
court
because
we
said
if
we
have
the
name
of
the
informant,
we
suggested
that
the
trial
court,
it
will
probably
prove
rugendorf's
innocence.
what
better
demand
the
demonstration
we
can
make
where
rugendorf
was
not
shown
anywhere
to
have
any
connection
with
the
crime,
anywhere
along
the
line,
i
do
not
know.
i
would
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
they
do
not
abandon
that.
they
include
that
and
they
add
others.
they
shift
position
because
part
of
their
brief
states
that
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
government
is
to
protect
its
informant
from
possible
harm.
but
i
think
that
--
in
our
brief
we
answer
in
the
piemonte
case
where
the
government
insisted
on
information
from
an
individual
from
the
penitentiary
who
said,
"my
life
is
in
danger.
the
lives
of
my
children
are
in
danger.
the
life
of
my
wife
is
in
danger.
i
cannot
give
you
the
information."
the
government
nonetheless
put
him
in
jail
for
18
months
because
he
wouldn't
give
information
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
there
and
this
court
held
that
it
is
a
citizen's
right
and
duty
to
come
forward
where
the
--
where
the
government
needed
it.
well,
equal
standing
under
the
law,
the
defendant
needed,
in
this
case,
he
didn't
get
it.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
we
--
yes,
your
honor.
we
were
entitled
to
the
informant's
name
to
determine
whether
one,
a
confidential
informant
even
existed,
whether
that
confidential
informant
was
a
confidential
informant
previously
known
to
have
been
reliable.
we
have
no
tests.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
but
mr.
justice
white,
in
this
case,
we
demonstrated
factual
falsities
upon
the
hearing.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
your
honor.
he
said
that
he
got
the
information
--
he
said
that
he
got
the
information
from
a
confidential
informant
who
gave
it
to
an
fbi
man
who
said
to
him,
the
affiant
that
sam
rugendorf
for
example
was
the
manager,
the
government
trivializes
that
and
says
it's
a
peripheral
fact
but
it's
upon
those
facts
that
the
government
relies
for
corroboration.
they
say
that
these
are
the
corroborative
facts
that
the
affiant
had
which
takes
them
into
jones
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
i
think
this
court
might
well
consider
that
informant's
identity
should
be
revealed
if
an
issue
was
raised
in
fourth
amendment
cases
because
otherwise,
what
protection
does
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
i
--
it's
difficult
to
answer
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
do
a
way
and
i
don't
--
and
we
don't
propose
that
this
court
do
a
way
necessarily
with
the
informer's
privilege.
the
government
may
choose
not
to
prosecute.
the
government
has
chosen
in
other
cases
but
not
prosecute.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
not
precisely
your
honor
because
in
this
case,
the
government
presented
an
--
an
affidavit
in
which
they
said
that
the
informant
was
in
the
home
of
the
defendant.
wouldn't
it
be
relevant
and
helpful
to
the
defendant
to
know
how
he
got
into
his
home
by
trespass?
that
is
the
government's
position
was
that
this
informant
has
intimate
detailed
knowledge
of
this
alleged
crime.
he
was
in
the
defendant's
basement,
he
said
on
a
certain
date,
within
a
week
prior
to
march
16th,
somewhere
between
that
time.
doesn't
that
fact
then
suggest
the
necessity
for
the
revelation
of
that
informant
under
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
we
don't
know
whether
he
even
existed,
your
honor.
and
i
--
and
i
respectfully
refer,
your
honor
in
the
court
to
united
states
versus
pearce
where
the
affiant
agent
gave
an
identical
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
that
would
not
be
relevant
to
use
at
trial.
that
would
be
relevant
on
--
on
the
suppression
of
the
search
warrant.
but
for
use
on
trial,
where
--
where
the
government
moves
forward
and
said
under
oath
that
this
informant
was
in
the
basement,
it
would
be
helpful
for
sam
to
know
if
the
informant
would
say,
"i
didn't
get
in
with
sam,
i
got
in
with
leo
or
somebody
else
or
maybe
i
got
in
with
the
connivance
of
the
fbi.
maybe
i
violated
your
rights
by
trespassing
at
the
time
when
you
were
not
there."
we
don't
know.
it's
conjectural
as
the
government
suggests.
but
it's
upon
this
conjecture
that
we
are
left
in
the
dark
and
it's
upon
this
conjecture
that
we
need.
a
cross-examiner
is
never
able
to
determine
what
facts
he
can
get
from
and
adverse
witness
until
he
cross-examines.
we
need
the
informant
for
the
defense.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
but
not
under
the
posture
of
this
case
wherein
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
it
might
be,
your
honor.
it
might
be
useful
to
learn
when
she
came
into
the
house
and
with
whom
and
where
was
sam
at
the
time.
it
might
be
helpful
to
develop
facts
to
show
to
the
jury
that
sam
was
not
involved
in
the
case,
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
whether
or
not
he
possessed
them
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
because
all
the
government
relied
upon
this
case,
your
honor,
was
constructive
possession
not
actual
possession
and
not
actual
knowledge.
and
what
if
these
were
a
wiretap
case?
what
if
the
information
came
to
the
government
by
means
of
wiretap
and
that's
a
potentiality
and
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
but
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
until
we
get
the
identity
of
the
informant,
subpoena
the
informant
and
ask
questions
of
the
informant.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
respectfully,
i
would
say
no
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
i
can
envision
many
cases.
and
let
us
say
a
man
is
going
to
rob
a
bank
and
tells
somebody
he's
going
to
rob
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
very
simply.
let
us
say
someone
tells
me
there,
yes
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes
sir.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
your
honor.
supposing
somebody
tells
me
that
he's
going
to
rob
a
bank
tomorrow
at
8
p.m.
and
i
advise
the
authorities
and
the
authorities
are
there
with
police
and
they
wait
until
this
man
goes
in
to
rob
a
bank.
essential
to
his
defense
is
not
the
name
or
the
identity
of
the
informant
because
he
is
caught
in
the
act.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
your
honor.
i
thought
i
just
demonstrated
a
very
short
factual
situation
whereby
the
name
of
the
informant
would
not
be
immaterial
to
the
defense
of
an
individual
who
is
going
to
rob
a
bank
and
is
caught
in
the
act
of
robbing
a
bank
and
that
information
that
he's
going
to
commit
the
act
comes
from
a
confidential
informant.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
i'll
try
to
do
it
within
five
minutes.
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question,
was
there
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
which
this
court
determined
that
a
hearing
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
a
warrant
was
proper
at
a
hearing,
we
refer
your
honor
to
giordenello
versus
united
states,
357
u.s.
480.
and
it
is
my
belief
in
that
case
that
your
honors
held
that
a
hearing
on
the
truth
of
--
on
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
warrant
is
appropriate
after
arrest.
with
respect
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
whether
or
not
anyone
was
prosecuted,
i
did
not
in
my
original
argument,
make
any
comment
on
--
on
it
because
it
was
--
it
holds
the
record,
but
i
state
to
this
court
without
further
contradiction
that
nobody
else
to
this
date
was
arrested
or
prosecuted
whether
somebody
will
be
or
not,
it's
something
which
i
have
no
knowledge.
may
i
come
to
pearce,
that's
a
seventh
circuit
case
from
which
this
case
arises,
that's
275
f.2d,
in
that
case,
the
affiant
to
get
a
search
warrant
was
an
fbi
agent,
he
said
under
oath,
“i
received
information
from
a
confidential
informant
previously
known
to
me
to
be
reliable.”
he
didn't
even
say
that
he
got
it
second
hand
removed
as
the
agent
said
of
this
case.
the
trial
judge
there
in
the
district
court
of
chicago,
as
distinguished
from
the
trial
judge
here
in
the
district
of
chicago,
permitted
under
giordenello,
a
hearing
on
the
validity
of
the
search
warrants.
the
following
facts
occurred.
the
affiant
agent
revealed
that
he
did
not
get
the
information
from
a
confidential
informant
previously
known
to
him
to
--
previously
known
to
him
to
have
been
reliable.
he
got
it
from
his
superior
in
chicago.
his
superior
in
chicago
got
it
from
a
parallel
individual,
a
comparable
fbi
agent
in
portland,
oregon
or
seattle,
washington
i
forget.
and
that
that
individual
got
it
from
an
agent
who
got
it
from
the
confidential
inform
--
informant
who
was
named
john
pearce,
the
brother
of
the
defendant
in
that
case.
john
pearce
was
then
brought
to
court,
the
confidential
informant,
and
he
testified
under
oath
that
he
did
not
speak
to
any
agent
until
september
9
of
the
particular
year
in
question,
but
the
affidavit
asserted
facts
known
to
the
affiant
on
september
7,
two
days
before
the
affiant
agent
was
alleged
under
oath,
to
have
spoken
to
a
series
of
agents
who
got
their
information
from
an
informant.
the
confidential
informant
in
that
case,
was
not
a
confidential
informant.
he
did
not
exist
according
to
the
affidavit
and
he
never
before
in
his
life
gave
information
to
the
agent
and
the
information
alleged
by
the
affiant
that
he
gave
was
incorrect
in
the
affiant.
now,
how
would
pearce
be
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
unless
the
trial
judge
there
permitted
what
the
trial
judge
here
did
not
permit?
where
is
the
defendant
going
to
go?
what
can
he
do
to
demonstrate
the
falsity
of
the
affidavit?
his
abilities,
his
powers
nowhere
equal,
we
don't
come
close
to
the
power
and
the
magnitude
that
the
government
has
to
protect
an
informant,
for
example
or
to
reveal
information.
all
we
can
do
is
do
our
best
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
that
we
had
and
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
that
we
had
in
this
case,
we
demonstrated
within
those
areas
within
our
power
falsity
of
an
importance.
the
government
has
attempted
to
trivialize
it
in
every
brief
they
have
said,
when
the
affiant
gave
information
so-called,
to
the
affiant
agent,
the
confidential
informant
said
that
he
saw
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
burglars
swish
in
the
meat
market
managed
by
rugendorf.
the
government
now
asserts
to
this
court,
that's
trivial.
presumably,
the
government
prepared
that
affidavit
in
the
hopes
that
that
is
corroborative
--
that
is
corroborative
of
the
final
conclusion
to
issue
the
search
warrant
against
sam
rugendorf.
and
as
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
first,
of
the
--
of
the
affiant,
stated
that
--
that
an
informant
has
advised
him
that
sam
rugendorf
was
the
manager
of
rugendorf
brothers
meat
market.
that
was
not
so.
the
affiant
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
--
that
sam
rugendorf
managed
the
meat
market
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
respectfully
no,
your
honor.
if
we
can
show
that
--
if
we
can
show
that
the
affiant
is
putting
into
the
information
incorrect
information,
supposing
your
honor
--
supposing,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
were
no
affiant.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
i'm
sorry,
confidential
informant.
supposing
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
--
we
can't
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
well,
we
demonstrated
that
agent
mccormick,
who
is
alleged
by
the
affiant
to
have
told
policeman
kelleher
that
sam
rugendorf
managed
the
meat
market,
was
incorrect.
now,
we're
accused
of
not
bring
again
agent
mccormick
who
i
advised
the
court,
we
were
told
the
day
before
is
in
the
hospital
for
an
operation
from
which
i
may
now
advice
the
court
that
this
is
the
course
of
the
record
too,
he
never
recovered.
he
died
of
cancer.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
the
giordenello?
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
assume
that
that
might
have
answered
your
honor's
question.
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
julius
lucius
echeles
yes,
your
honor.
yes
sir,
i
thank
the
court.
