mr.
acheson
to
--
to
determine
what
is
probable
cause,
what
isn't
and
whether
there
should
be
a
search
warrant
rather
than
to
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
follow
--
would
that
follow
in
all
cases?
for
instance,
a
--
a
common
knowledge,
let's
say
that
there's
a
bootlegging
joint
in
existence
and
people
generally
speak
about
it
and
i
suppose
it
be
nine
chances
out
of
10
that
a
man
would
be
right
if
--
if
he
made
an
affidavit
that
--
that
he
knew
that
there
was
liquor
in
there.
would
that
justify
an
officer
and
just
--
just
saying,
“well,
i
have
information
and
along
the
search
warrant,
you
get
a
search
warrant
on
that
thing
without
disclosing
who
it
is
or
whether
he
had
purchased
there
or
not
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
is
--
that
would
be
a
very
common
one,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
guess
i'll
--
i
guess
i
was
a
prosecutor
in
a
different
day
when
that
was
a
common
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
prohibition
days.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
here
you
--
here
you,
let
them
use
a
second
and
third
hand
--
a
second
and
third
hand
hearsay
and
the
commissioner
doesn't
see
any
of
these
--
any
of
these
people.
all
he
gets
is
this
affidavit
from
the
police
officer
and
second
and
third
hand
hearsay
and
he
issues
--
issues
a
warrant.
and
there
is
no
informant
name
to
talk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
--
how
does
that
connect
up
with
--
with
these
particular
garments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
--
is
that
a
corroboration
of
the
fact
that
these
furs
are
to
be
found
in
the
--
in
the
home
of
this
man?
i
don't
see
their
corroborative
value
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
but
at
the
time
he
made
this
affidavit,
they
hadn't
--
they
didn't
know
what
was
in
that
basement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
i
--
i
still
don't
see
how
the
--
the
investigation
of
the
reports
of
the
federal
investigation
would
tie
that
particular
robbery
to
this
particular
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
your
point,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
case
that
counsel
cited
though,
isn't
somewhat
apropos.
it
is
not
decisive
but
apropos.
but
the
one
where
--
where
a
man
who
is
known
to
--
who
had
been
convicted
with
a
narcotic
offense
is
being
a
part
of
a
large
conspiracy
was
in
the
penitentiary
and
under
sentence.
and
the
government
called
him
to
the
witness
stand
and
he
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
the
government
says,
“well,
we
grant
you
immunity."
and
he
said,
"well,
if
i
squeal
being
in
this
penitentiary,
my
life
isn't
worth
anything.
and
the
judge
said,
"well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you're
a
citizen
and
as
a
duty
of
a
citizen
to
come
through
in
--
in
the
courtroom
and
--
and
give
all
the
evidence
that
he
has
to
bring
about
the
justice."
and
he
sentenced
him
to
jail
for
i
think,
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years
and
this
court
held,
“yes,
that's
right,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
do
that.
you
have
to
testify
because
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
testify."
now,
why
isn't
that
incumbent
on
the
government
also,
to
do
that
with
an
informer
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
his
testimony
might
clear
this
man
of
this
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
--
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
had
kept
his
mouth
shut
and
had
gone
to
the
penitentiary
for
15
or
20
years.
perhaps,
in
order
to
avoid
being
killed
and
then
government
said,
“you
must
testify
now
and
take
the
chance
of
getting
--
getting
killed
because
that's
the
responsibility
of
every
good
citizen.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
realize
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
two
cases
that
i
--
i
said
so,
but,
some
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
she
pick
it
up,
you
mean
after
the
search
or
at
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
time
of
the
search,
yes.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
who
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
his
--
suppose
it
was
his
brother
who
--
who
was
inlaid
with
the
burglars
and
--
and
who
did
what
those
first
in
that
house
while
he
was
away
--
the
petitioner
was
away
in
--
in
florida.
and
suppose
the
brother
was
a
man
who
--
who
is
the
informant,
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
great
importance
to
this
petitioner
to
know
that
his
brother
was
the
one
who
had
made
the
--
had
made
the
affidavit
or
given
the
information
for
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
that
have
helped
him
to
get
an
acquittal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
ever
in
that
basement
from
the
time
he
came
back
from
florida?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
circumstantial
evidence
that
he
was
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
the
chief
charge
--
why
would
the
chief
charge
them
with
--
would
it
if
she
was
the
one
who
--
who
had
the
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
if
you're
going
--
if
you're
not
going
to
do
that,
don't
you
have
to
tie
it
up
to
him
in
some
personal
way?
can
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
his
wife
knew
it
therefore,
he
must
know
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
was
that
evidence
that
shook
his
credibility?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
echeles.
