mr.
david
c.
acheson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner's
attack
on
the
probable
cause
in
the
affidavit
underlying
the
warrant
has
narrowed,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
very
particular
allegation
that
falsity
was
discovered
in
the
affidavit,
in
the
representation
that
an
officer,
kelleher,
told
the
affiant
that
the
petitioner
in
the
case
was
the
manager
of
a
meat
market
going
by
the
name
of
rugendorf
brothers.
i
think
we
can
pass
quickly
over
the
point
that
the
information
was
quite
immaterial
to
probable
cause.
indeed,
10
years
earlier,
the
information
had
been
accurate.
petitioner
had,
in
fact,
been
the
manager
of
the
meat
market
with
his
brother
some
10
years
earlier,
and
it's
understandable
that
this
reputation
might
still
exist
among
confidential
sources
in
chicago.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
would.
at
page
17
of
the
record,
in
the
testimony
of
officer
kelleher,
it
appears
that
he
did
in
fact
tell
mccormick
that
he
saw
schweihs
at
the
meat
market.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
at
least
not
in
this
case,
it
was
a
proceeding
against
a
single
defendant
and
whether
at
a
later
or
earlier
time,
there
had
been
a
prosecution
or
might
still
be
one,
i
--
i
can't
say.but
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
case,
there
was
this
sole
defendant.
now
the
affidavit,
if
the
court
please,
at
page
7
of
the
record,
is
quite
ambiguous
on
the
point
whether
the
agent
mccormick
originated
the
statement
that
petitioner
had
been
the
manager
of
the
meat
market
or
whether
mccormick
merely
relayed
the
information
from
officer
kelleher.
the
affidavit
doesn't
make
it
at
all
clear
which
was
the
case.
the
sources
of
clarification
of
that,
of
course,
would
have
been
the
officer
kelleher,
who
did
testify
on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
officer
mccormick,
who
is
either
the
originator
or
the
channel
of
that
information.
now,
it's
noteworthy
that
officer
mccormick
did
not
testify,
special
agent
mccormick
did
not
testify.
he
was,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
in
the
hospital
as
the
record
shows
at
page
18,
but
the
court
might
note
that
from
june
4th
when
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
was
filed
until
the
first
week
in
july
when
the
trial
began,
there
was
an
opportunity,
a
month's
opportunity
to
take
the
deposition
of
mccormick,
confront
him
with
the
fact
and
obtain
clarification
of
the
fact
that
appears
in
the
affidavit.
i
think
it's
further
significant
that
when
of
--
agent
moore
was
on
the
witness
stand,
agent
moore
was
not
asked
on
examination
by
petitioner
whether
mccormick
originated
the
information
or
whether
mccormick
truly
said
that
the
information
came
from
kelleher
and
therefore,
it
can't
be
said
that
officer
moore
lied
in
the
affidavit.
there
are
two
hypotheses
which
were
left
entirely
open
by
petitioner
which
are
as
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
affidavit
as
the
notion
that
officer
kelleher
originated
this
information
himself.
now,
the
extremely
insubstantial
claim
that
this
type
of
inaccurate
information
perhaps
shown
after
the
fact
to
be
incorrect
in
a
minor
respect,
the
claim
at
that
time
of
a
--
an
error
in
an
affidavit,
is
ground
for
disclosure
of
a
confidential
informant.
raises
in
the
most
serious
way,
we
submit,
the
question
what
is
the
weight
of
the
quality
of
the
public
policy
behind
the
confidentiality
of
an
informant.
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
would
dispute.
certainly,
i
think
it
lies
within
the
common
knowledge
of
all
of
us
that
professional
criminals
operate
in
secrecy.
certainly,
the
narcotic
rings
and
stolen
property
rings,
gamblers,
the
more
serious
type
of
organized
professional
crime
that
we're
familiar
--
we're
familiar
with,
not
only
requires
secrecy
but
secrecy
indeed
is
characteristic
of
their
operations.
and
the
law
can't
effectively
check
these
operations
without
penetrating
in
some
way,
this
cloak
of
secrecy
that
they
wrapped
themselves
in.
it
is
here
of
course,
that
the
function
of
the
confidential
source
becomes
important.
the
very
great
weight
placed
on
these
sources
by
former
attorney
general
jackson.
the
discussion
of
the
uses
of
confidential
informants
and
they're
necessity
in
obtaining
confidential
information
from
inside
a
criminal
conspiracy
fully
discussed
in
harney
and
cross,
the
book
cited
in
our
brief,
make
it
clear
that
indeed
the
--
the
rather
modern
and
impressive
laboratory
methods
of
crime
detection
don't
hold
a
great
deal
of
weight
in
comparison
with
the
value
of
confidential
source.
the
information
that
comes
from
inside
of
the
conspiracy
is
of
course
much
more
timely,
much
more
important
than
the
information
that
comes
from
examining
a
human
hair
under
a
microscope.
if
--
if
these
facts
are
accepted
and
i
think
our
common
knowledge
has
to
reinforce
them,
it
follows
that
confidentiality
is
important
to
the
continuity
of
the
confidential
source
is
a
channel
of
information.
it
isn't
just
a
matter
if
the
court
please,
of
the
safety
and
the
life
of
a
confidential
informant.
the
more
cold-blooded
and
perhaps
more
serious
aspect,
the
continuity
of
the
information
that
comes
from
this
source
is
a
matter
of
the
most
urgent
importance.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
examination
in
camera,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
particularly
risky
type
of
compromise
of
the
problem.
i
think
on
the
surface,
it's
a
--
it's
a
pleasing
and
perhaps
seemingly
acceptable
compromise.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh
i
quite
understand
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
i
--
as
i
don't
have
to
tell
you,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
u.s.
courthouse
and
--
and
--
and
the
bailiffs,
the
marshals,
the
secretaries,
the
elevator
operators
are
not
all
screened
for
their,
what
you
might
call
"top
secret
security."
i
think
it's
quite
improbable
that
a
confidential
informant
could
come
to
the
office
of
the
u.s.
commissioner
in
a
u.s.
courthouse,
there
be
examined
and
leave
the
courthouse
without
a
functionary
or
newspaper
reporter
or
a
defense
counsel
perhaps
in
another
case,
seeing
him,
knowing
who
he
was
and
--
and
being
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
there.
quite
able,
i
would
judge,
to
guess
the
purpose
for
his
being
there.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
my
position
mr.
justice
harlan
would
be
that
if
the
public
policy
behind
confidentiality
is
to
have
any
weight
at
all,
there
must
be
some
preliminary
factual
showing
of
the
bad
faith
of
the
affiant
or
some
reason
perhaps
outside
of
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit.
some
reason
to
think
that
he
is
lying
in
the
affidavit.
preliminary
showings
are
--
are
not
unknown
to
the
criminal
procedure.
they're
required
before
a
--
for
example
a
motion
to
require
pre-trial
inspection
of
documents
is
granted
under
rule
17
before
a
grand
jury
transcript
is
available
under
rule
6.
there
are
many
instances
where
preliminary
showings
are
precondition
of
--
of
the
relief
that
the
defendant
asks.
it
seems
to
me
this
could
easily
be
such
a
case.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
not
in
the
case
of
a
search
warrant,
a
search
with
a
warrant
mr.
chief
justice,
search
such
as
this
was.
the
police
officer
must
specify
the
property
that
he
is
searching
for,
specify
very
precisely,
its
whereabouts
in
terms
that
would
make
impossible
for
him
to
invent
facts
on
a
hunch
and
hope
that
the
property
that
he
found
would
confirm
his
hunch.
the
united
states
commissioner's
manual
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
of
course
a
case
can
be
imagined
such
as
that?
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
--
i
should
think
it
--
it
would
not
be
common
respectfully
that
the
agent
would
knowingly
falsify
a
fact.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
should
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
should
think
that
the
value
of
the
preliminary
screening
of
a
warrant
which
is
accomplished
by
a
u.s.
commissioner
is
a
very
valuable
protection
of
the
person
whose
premises
are
being
searched.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
circumstances
such
as
this,
there
is
and
of
course,
this
court
has
said,
there
must
be
present
reason
to
credit
the
hearsay.
now,
where
there
is
reason
to
credit
the
hearsay
as
--
as
here
for
example,
the
statement
on
page
8
of
the
record,
that
the
affiant
had
personally
examined
the
records.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
at
the
bottom
of
page
8
of
the
printed
transcript.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that
he
had
examined
the
records
in
the
fbi
files
regarding
fur
robberies
for
the
past
six
months.
now,
this
is
indeed
a
kind
of
personal
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
affiant.
he
has
surely
some
reason
to
credit
the
information
he
finds
in
the
fbi
files
and
here,
he's
done
a
personal
investigation
of
the
records.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
it
connects
in
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
description
contained
in
the
files
according
to
this
affidavit,
is
the
only
description
that
he
can
find
in
the
files
which
matches
the
description
of
the
first
seen
by
the
confidential
informant
in
the
premises
that
they
searched.
now,
that's
a
--
that's
a
pretty
reliable
corroboration
of
the
hearsay
unless
one
assumes
that
the
agent
will
be
lying
whenever
he
set
forth
such
a
fact.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
but
now,
the
--
he
says
that
the
only
burglary
totaling
over
$5000,
containing
a
similar
description
of
the
first
described
by
the
informant,
which
were
the
first
scene
of
the
house
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh,
the
informant
had
indeed
reported
prior
to
the
making
of
this
affidavit.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
furs
in
the
petitioner's
house
were
seen
on
--
between
march
9th
and
march
15th.
this
affidavit
was
executed
on
march
22nd.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
reference
to
the
first
described
by
the
informant
is
of
course,
to
the
first
scene
some
ten
days
earlier
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
--
by
the
informant
in
the
petitioner's
home.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
before
we
leave
this
point,
if
the
court
please
and
in
partial
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
as
recently
as
january
28th,
the
new
york
daily
news
carried
a
rather
shocking
story
of
an
informant
who
--
who
left
the
courthouse
in
chicago
where
he
was
giving
information
in
a
state
jurisdiction
on
an
insurance
fraud.
and
as
he
stepped
in
his
car
to
drive
away,
there
was
an
explosion
under
the
hood
which
hurled
him
out
of
the
car
and
there
is
a
photograph
and
quite
a
story
about
his
informer
role,
the
injury
he
suffered
and
the
probable
source
of
the
bombing.
this
is
illustrative,
i
think,
of
the
fact
that
the
confidential
source
leads
a
rather
hazardous
life.
he
parts
with
information
only
on
the
condition
that
the
government
will
preserve
his
confidentiality.
the
very
trial
judge
in
this
case
at
page
129
of
the
original
trial
transcript
referred
to
the
common
occurrence
of
retaliation
and
violence
against
witnesses
in
chicago
at
or
about
the
time
of
this
trial.
and
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
case
you
described,
the
piemonte
case
i
believe.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
convict
was
known.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
convict,
piemonte,
was
known.
that
is,
he
had
been
through
a
trial,
people
knew
who
he
was,
people
knew
what
bracket
he
was
connected
with.
people
indeed
with
whom
he
had
worked,
his
confederates,
prior
confederates
undoubtedly
knew
what
he
knew.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
so
he
wasn't
constitutionally
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
--
the
question
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
whether
an
informant
who
is
known,
who
was
already
been
disclosed,
must
come
to
court
and
tell
what
he
knows.
the
question
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
an
informant
who
is
not
disclosed.
the
underworld
doesn't
know
who
he
is.
they
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
he
knows
whether
he
must
reveal
his
identity.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that's
a
partial
answer
mr.
justice
douglas
but
the
petitioner
was
not
in
a
petition
--
the
position,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
of
casting
about
helplessly
to
find
some
way
of
proving
his
innocence,
as
petitioner's
counsel
would
have
you
believe.
the
evidence
show,
the
record
at
page
30,
that
there
were
four
people
who
had
keys
to
the
petitioner's
home.
now,
if
a
plant
or
if
a
perjurious
government
agent
had
entered
the
house
through
any
of
those
who
had
keys
to
plant
the
furs
in
the
basement,
putting
aside
the
possibility
that
petitioner
or
petitioner's
wife
would
let
--
let
them
in.
presumably,
one
of
these
four
people
who
had
keys
would've
been
the
ones
to
admit
a
stranger.
now,
none
of
those
people
who
had
keys,
not
one
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
by
the
petitioner
except
the
neighbor,
mr.
roskin
and
he
wasn't
asked
whether
he
admitted
anybody
to
the
house.
he
was
only
asked
whether
he
put
the
furs
there
himself,
which
of
course,
he
denied.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
here
where
the
three
relatives
who
had
keys.
if
his
hypothesis
is
--
is
correct,
presumably
one
of
those
three
or
four,
counting
mr.
roskin,
would
be
called
to
the
stand
and
he
might
say,
“yes,
i
remember
about
two
weeks
ago,
thursday,
i
admitted
someone
and
it
looks
like
that
man
in
the
courtroom
back
there
and
he
had
a
lot
of
big
white
bags
with
him.”
now,
perhaps
a
wild
guess,
but
no
effort
was
made
to
defend
himself
by
the
petitioner
through
any
of
these
witnesses
who
would've
been
in
the
best
position
of
anybody
to
have
admitted
a
third
party.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh,
not
necessarily,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
quite
understandable
that
one
would
open
a
door
to
let
in
what
the
seemingly
a
laundryman,
who
would
carry
four
white
bags
to
the
basement
and
not
pry,
not
examine
them,
not
open
them,
not
of
any
way
of
knowing
that
their
contents
were
furs.
now
on
the
road,
the
arrow
point
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
justice
harlan,
our
position
is
that
there
must
be
a
careful
balance
based
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
it's
a
three-way
balance,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
which
--
which
office,
mr.
justice?
mr.
david
c.
acheson
in
this
--
in
this
district?
oh
i
would
assume
two
a
week.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
it
is
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
--
almost
in
narcotics
cases,
it's
almost
the
unexceptionable
rule,
in
other
types
of
cases,
it
varies.
now,
the
balance
i
speak
of,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
three-way
balance.
society
has
need
of
the
confidential
information.
the
informant
surely
has
need
of
his
life.
the
defendant
of
course,
may
--
may
need
in
a
particular
case
the
information
to
attack
the
veracity
of
the
affiant.
but
the
only
way
to
make
this
balance
without
erasing
the
public
interest
and
confidentiality
or
without
erasing
the
defendant's
interest
in
making
his
claim
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
is
to
require
some
reason
to
suspect
or
to
attack
the
veracity
of
the
affiant
beyond
merely,
the
claim
that,
man
is
presumably
wicked
and
the
only
way
one
can
make
a
defense
on
a
motion
to
suppress
is
to
call
him
a
liar,
call
the
affiant
a
liar
and
expose
the
informant
to
prove
it.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
10
years
make
a
difference
but,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it's
vital
to
emphasize
that
this
was
not
a
warrant
of
arrest
which
might
have
made
the
identity
of
leo
rugendorf
pertinent
to
the
guilt
of
the
petitioner.
this
was
not
a
warrant
of
arrest.
the
likely
guilt
or
innocence
of
petitioner
was
absolutely
immaterial
to
a
search
warrant.
the
only
question
in
the
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
was
whether
what
appeared
to
be
stolen
property,
was
located
in
petitioner's
home.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
only
pertinence
of
the
meat
market
information
was
relative
to
--
to
the
question
of
where
they
might
find
him
that
the
time
came
to
arrest
him.
it
was
information
that,
in
effect,
provided
a
business
address
for
the
petitioner
and
nothing
more.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
on
a
search
warrant
now,
just
the
search
warrant,
it
is
immaterial
whether
it's
a
plant
or
not.
you
get
a
search
warrant
out
to
go
to
the
premises
and
recover
the
property.
now
at
the
trial,
the
evidence
is
to
whether
it's
a
plant
should
come
out
and
would
be
timely
and
there,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
absolutely
incomprehensible
by
the
four
people
with
keys,
the
three
relatives
with
keys,
were
not
called
to
testify
if
petitioner's
hypothesis
is
true
to
make
the
plant
story
out.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
if
you
credit
the
information
that
the
furs
were
seen
there
that
everything
else
is
immaterial.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
--
the
remainder
was
an
attempt
to
have
out
of
excessive
caution,
corroborating
information.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
right,
absolutely.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
just
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
in
the
jones
case,
the
reason
to
credit
to
hearsay
is
advanced
in
this
affidavit.
the
fact
that
other
informants
tie
the
suspects
in
the
robbery,
the
fact
that
the
first
were,
indeed,
seen
in
petitioner's
house,
the
--
whether
or
not
petitioner
was
manager
of
the
meat
market,
doesn't
go
to
the
last
--
the
crucial
paragraph.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
it
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
justice,
i
think
what
you
say
would
--
would
be
precisely
right
except
for
the
fact,
and
this
is
important,
that
it
is
--
the
--
the
--
the
affidavit
seems
to
say
either
--
on
page
7,
either
that
kelleher
provided
the
manager
information
or
that
mccormick
provided,
quite
ambiguous.
now,
there's
no
basis
to
suspect
this
part
of
the
affidavit
until
you
exhaust
what
mccormick
knows.
mccormick
might
have
been
the
one
who
provide
this
information.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
he
was
never
--
he
was
never
examined.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh,
we
don't
claim
that
at
all,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
we
go
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit,
of
course.
it
--
it
can't
be
justified
by
evidence,
the
property
later
recovered.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
as
regards
the
meat
market
information,
it
did
not
come
from
an
informant
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
--
but
according
to
the
affidavit
from
kelleher,
a
police
officer
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
--
and
through
mccormick.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
now,
the
agent
didn't
say
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
he
said
he
did
not
originally
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
but
if
mccormick
had
testified
and
had
said,
"i
told
moore
that
petitioner
was
the
manager
of
this
meat
market,
then
his
affidavit
would
be
substantially
correct.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
fairly.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
think
if
the
affiant
had
been
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
had
the
bad
faith
of
the
affiant
been
shown,
mr.
justice
black,
as
in
the
pearce
case,
i
think
the
government
would
have
to
concede
that
the
underlying
probable
cause
was
demolished.
but
that
isn't
what
happened.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
yes,
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
affiant
did
lie
then
we
--
i
--
i
would
agree
that
that
in
question
can
be
explored
on
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
but
there
has
to
be
some
preliminary
factual
basis
to
think
that
that
happened.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
--
the
--
we
claim
that
what
would
demol
--
the
only
thing
that
would
demolish
the
probable
cause
would
be
a
showing
of
bad
faith,
subjective
lying
by
the
affiant.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
if
that
had
been
preliminarily
shown
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
--
then
of
course
a
full
expo
--
exploration
of
that
on
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
because
he
has
to
go
by
the
best
information
it
gets,
whatever
that
sorts.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
pearce,
united
states
against
pearce
in
sixth
circuit.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
cited
in
our
brief.
it
doesn't
control
us,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i
say
that
had
there
been
a
showing
of
a
lie
by
the
affiant,
then
we
would
agree
as
the
dicta
indicate
in
the
--
in
the
pearce
case
that
the
probable
cause
would
collapse.
but
of
course
the
pearce
case
doesn't
hold
that
there
should
be
a
disclosure
of
the
informer
because
that
question
was
never
presented.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
you
can
try
out
whether
the
affiant
believe
they
were
true
or
false
because
the
probable
cause
relates
only
to
what
is
the
--
the
subjective
accuracy
and
good
faith
of
his
affidavit.
i
--
i
don't
think
you
can
shake
the
probable
cause
by
showing
after
the
fact
that
the
information
that
came
to
him
was
inaccurate.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
furs
were
found
or
proven
to
have
been
hanging
on
individual
wire
of
hangers
unconcealed
behind
closet
doors
that
were
not
locked
to
double
door
closet
in
the
petitioner's
basement.
bags,
large
white
bags
were
found
both
in
the
closet
and
on
the
floor
outside
the
closet.
petitioner's
wife
picked
the
fur
out
from
among
those
hanging
in
the
closet,
claimed
it
as
her
own.
there
was
evidence
that
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
at
--
at
the
time
of
the
search,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
the
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that's
right
but
her
first
statement
was
that
it
belonged
to
her.
the
brother,
leo,
returned
the
key.
some
--
some
evidence
showed,
although
there's
dispute
about
that,
some
week
or
10
days
before
the
search
took
place,
it
was
evidenced
that
petitioner's
wife
used
the
basement
after
they're
returned
from
their
vacation
on
march
4th.
from
then
to
a
time
of
the
search,
used
it
by
doing
laundry
there,
consumable
goods
were
stored
on
closet
shelves
there,
the
basement
showed
the
signs
of
--
of
use.
the
reliability,
the
--
the
credibility
of
both
petitioner
and
petitioner's
wife
when
they
denied
knowledge
of
the
furs
hanging
there,
was
severely
shaken
we
submit
by
the
testimony
of
agent
lee,
agent
moore,
and
u.s.
--
assistant
u.s.
attorney
monahan,
a
large
volume
of
conflicts
of
evidence
were
developed
in
their
testimonies
--
between
their
testimony
and
petitioner
and
petitioner's
wife,
which
went
that
certainly
to
the
credibility
of
petitioner
and
of
petitioner's
wife.
the
instructions
to
the
jury
are
very
clear
that
this
is
a
case
involving
circumstantial
evidence,
that
the
jury
may
consider
circumstantial
evidence,
the
usual
instruction,
this
appears
at
page
575
of
the
original
trial
transcript.
that
a
--
an
inference
of
knowledge,
of
the
stolen
character
of
goods
is
permissible
from
proof
of
their
possession,
another
instruction
going
to
what
is
possession
and
joint
possession
between
petitioner
and
petitioner's
wife
of
the
premises
where
the
furs
were
found.
all
constructing
the
basis
for
permissible
jury
inference
that
possession
was
in
fact
had
by
petitioner
of
the
stolen
goods
and
of
course
since
he
had
it
and
there
is
no
explanation
of
how
he
had
it,
by
him,
a
number
of
uncapped
channels
of
--
of
witnesses
that
he
must
have
known
they
were
stolen.
that
was
the
case,
certainly
lying
well
within
the
cases
under
section
2315.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
yes,
he
did
at
some
length,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
if
i
may
suggest
one
or
two
types
of
showings,
the
showing
that
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
because
the
indictment,
mr.
justice
white,
charges
possessions
on
or
about
march
22nd.
that
was
the
day
of
the
search.
the
informant's
only
knowledge,
we
all
agree,
was
knowledge
between
march
9th
and
march
15th,
some
10
days
prior.
no
testimony
at
the
trial
suggested
any
transaction,
conversation,
interview,
physical
presence
or
anything
else
at
the
time
of
the
crime
between
the
petitioner
and
the
confidential
informant.
now,
all
of
these
cases
were
used
at
the
trial,
justifies
disclosure
or
in
cases
where
the
government
agents
get
on
the
stand.
and
they
say,
"we
saw
defendant
go
into
a
house
with
in
the
informant
x.
when
informant
x
came
out
of
the
house,
we
searched
him
and
found
narcotics
in
his
pocket.
who
is
informant
x?
so
we
can't
carry
it
to
say
and
that
the
philosophy
is
that
if
the
government
puts
into
evidence
transactions
with
the
informant
to
convict
the
petitioner
and
by
gully,
they
have
to
put
the
petition
--
the
--
the
informant
on
the
stand,
so
the
petitioner
can
defend
himself.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
hint
of
any
incriminating
transaction,
conversation
or
as
i
say,
even
physical
juxta
position
between
the
petitioner
and
the
informant
in
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
none
that
would
go
to
the
crime
of
possession
charged
on
or
about
march
22nd.
the
informant
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
if
the
issue
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
honestly
don't
think
so
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
this,
petitioner
was
not
charged
with
receiving
stolen
goods
or
stealing
goods.
actually
the
--
i
think,
the
term
receiving
is
in
the
statute
but
the
--
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
was
that
he
had
criminal
possession
of
stolen
goods.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
only
the
--
no
direct
evidence.
there
are
circumstantial
evidences.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
none
that
he
was
there
himself.
circumstantial
evidence
that
he
must
have
known
was
there
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
because
he
came
through
--
his
wife's
use
of
the
basement's
articles,
jointly
--
jointly
owned
by
both
of
them.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
--
i
don't
know
that
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
the
fact
that
his
wife
used
the
basement
the
fact
that
the
information
that
she
must've
had
about
the
bags
and
about
furs
would,
in
all
probability
have
come
to
him
and
the
fact
that
his
testimony
was
shaken
by
a
tax
on
his
credibility
on
rebuttal
have
all
laid
the
basis
for
a
permissible
jury
inference.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
he
testified
to
--
i
think
the
best
condensation
is
abusive
conduct
by
the
fbi
agents
who
arrested
him.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
he
testified
to
abusive
conduct
by
the
fbi
agents
who
arrested
him.
two
of
the
agents,
particularly
the
one
arresting
agent,
denied
all
of
those.
his
wife
similarly
made
charges
of
--
of
statements,
concessions
and
conduct
against
other
agents
and
those
agents
denied
that
in
terms
that
collaborated
each
other
rather
persuasively.
i
think
clearly
the
question
of
their
incredibility
as
witnesses,
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
there
--
there
is
a
warrant
mr.
justice
black
and
a
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
and
on
the
hearing,
a
witness
comes
forth
and
he
testifies
to
facts
which
make
it
probable
or
at
least,
reasonably
inferable
that
the
affiant
lied
let
us
say
or
had
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
--
was
inaccurate
on
the
substantial
way.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
now,
another
circumstances
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i
don't
think
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
nevertheless
the
--
the
probable
cause
will
stand
although
they
can
see
the
affiant
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
of
course
it
rests
upon
probably
cause.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
in
the
jones
case
certainly,
the
court
suggested
that
if
a
serious
attack
were
made
on
a
good
faith
of
the
affiant,
there
would
be
a
basis
there
to
disclose
the
informant.
now,
disclosing
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well
on
--
but
the
next
--
the
next
step
is
what
you're
talking
about
mr.
justice
black,
there's
no
point
in
disclosing
the
informant
unless
the
informant
is
then
permitted
to
do
contradict
the
facts
stated
by
the
affiant.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
we're
--
we're
saying
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
yes.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
there
are
hearings
on
motions
to
suppress
everyday.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
now,
all
we're
saying
is
that
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
we
--
we
wouldn't
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
right.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
on
--
on
a
hearing
--
in
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
we
would
certainly
not
take
the
position
that
evidence
is
barred
from
the
hearing
going
to
the
subjective
good
faith
and
truthfulness
of
the
affiant.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
unless
i
say,
i
think
the
necessary
suggested,
jones
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
in
which
it's
been
squarely
held.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
yes,
that's
it
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
an
unconscionable
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
that's
right
and
as
a
matter
of
the
self-respect
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
yes,
i
think
another
way
of
putting
it
is
that
we
can't
--
there
can't
be
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
commissioner
is
the
guarantor
of
the
good
faith
and
the
truthfulness
of
all
affiants.
mr.
david
c.
acheson
oh
no
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
no,
no.
well,
when
you
talk
about
--
mr.
david
c.
acheson
disclosing
the
informant,
you
then
introduce
a
brand
new
public
policy
that
has
to
be
weighed
against
the
interest
in
disclosing,
