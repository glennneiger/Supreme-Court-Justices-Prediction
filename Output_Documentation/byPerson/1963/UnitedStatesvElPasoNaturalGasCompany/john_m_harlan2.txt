aren't
you
what
--
what
you
really
quarrelling
with
here
is
not
standard,
is
it?
isn't
it
the
finding
of
fact
which
--
that
you're
--
were
trying
to
return.
you
said
at
the
beginning
there
was
a
standard,
a
wrong
standard
and
as
i've
been
listening
to
you,
it
seems
to
me
everything
that
you
said
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
findings
drawn
from
these
undisputed
subsidiary
effects
as
they're
largely
are,
were
correct.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
that's
the
wrong
conclusion,
that's
the
wrong
facts.

between
you
and
the
government
on
the
legal
standard?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
solicitor
general
says
that
he
is
not
trying,
except
for
the
minor
exception
or
two
as
i
understand
the
argument,
to
overturn
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
lower
court
but
he
claims
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
based
on
an
erroneous
legal
standard.
now,
is
this
what
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
all
of
these
to
me,
at
the
moment
means
that
you
draw
different
conclusions
from
common
legal
standard.
i
cannot
understand
what
the
legal
standard
is
that
differs
but
that
you
differ
with
the
(voice
