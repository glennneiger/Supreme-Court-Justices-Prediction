mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
before
commencing
the
argument
in
this
matter,
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
references
to
a
map
that
is
distributed
to
the
members
of
the
court
yesterday.
the
map
that
was
used
at
the
trial
showing
the
pipeline
system
of
the
country
is
at
page
894.
i
wish
to
make
a
few
comments
because
well,
i'm
sure
not
intentionally,
certain
misapprehensions
might
arise
from
the
additions
to
this
map
that
was
distributed.
let
me
call
attention
first
to
the
heavy
red
lines
at
the
bottom
portraying
the
pipeline
system
of
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
in
the
first
place,
it
will
be
noted
that
that
stops
at
the
state
line.
but
the
main
transmission
system
is
picked
up
there
however.
and
all
of
the
supplies
that
enter
california
are
carried
by
the
main
transmission
lines
either
of
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
or
the
southern
companies
to
the
centers
of
production
either
at
antioch
or
los
angeles
and
so
the
main
transmission
lines
should
be
drawn
to
their
conclusion.
yesterday,
a
mention
was
made
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
colored
line
portraying
the
transwestern
pipeline
system
which
counsel
called
attention
to
but
dismissed
with
the
comment
that
it
perhaps
did
not
amount
too
much
of
a
pipeline.
it's
a
pipeline
with
a
minimum
capacity
of
600
cubic
million
feet
per
day.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
well,
it
--
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
yes,
that's
97.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
now
to
the
pipeline
system
of
the
pacific
gas
transmission
company
and
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
which
enters
the
united
states
at
kingsport
on
the
canadian
border.
that
is
not
portrayed
in
any
color.
it
is
the
largest
pipeline
system
that
enters
the
state
of
california.
it
is
a
30-inch
pipeline
and
it
is
capable
of
carrying
as
much
as
one
million
cubic
feet
per
day,
the
largest
pipeline
in
the
state
too
and
in
the
state
of
california.
furthermore,
that
pipeline
system
--
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
number
68.
that
begins
at
kingsport
on
the
canadian
border
and
goes
to
antioch
in
california.
that
same
line,
the
pacific
gas
transmission
line
picks
up
all
of
the
supplies
which
el
paso
receives
at
the
canadian
border
and
transmits
it
to
spokane
and
from
spokane
to
klamath
falls.
and
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
takes
supplies
from
that
line
and
distributes
it
to
its
markets
in
those
two
states.
so
it
would
seem
that
this
is
indeed
an
important
pipeline
system
in
this
case.
the
next
thing
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
is
a
heavy
dotted
line
running
from
the
border
of
california
near
las
vegas
to
rock
springs.
again,
it
would
seem
that
if
we
are
to
portray
that
pipeline
system,
it
should
be
all
portrayed.
the
pipeline
system
not
only
runs
to
the
center
of
the
areas
of
production
in
los
angeles
if
it
had
ever
been
built
but
it
would
also
have
run
all
the
way
down
through
the
system
of
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company
to
the
sources
of
supply
in
the
panhandle
area
of
production.
so
that
instead
of
being
a
pipeline
simply
from
rock
springs
to
the
boarder
of
california,
it
would
be
a
pipeline
system
from
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
texas.
since
the
solicitor
general
has
outlined
the
history
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
mention
some
of
the
changes
that
have
occurred
since
the
suit
was
filed.
when
the
suit
was
filed,
it
was
charged
that
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
was
to
permanently
exclude
all
competitors
from
the
sale
and
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
the
several
western
states.
that
charge
is
no
longer
made.
it
is
not
claimed
now
that
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
had
any
reasonable
prospect
of
ever
competing
with
the
pacific
northwest
in
its
northwest
territory.
it
is
not
now
charged
that
there
was
any
prospect
of
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
as
a
separate
entity
competing
with
el
paso
in
any
of
the
southwest
states
or
in
texas.
the
question
of
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
acquisition
in
the
fields
of
production
has
been
--
have
been
abandoned.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
of
dominance
of
any
market
or
a
control
of
any
market
by
el
paso.
the
case
appeared
when
it
came
here
in
the
brief
form
to
be
limited
to
the
state
of
california,
to
the
natural
gas
market
in
the
state
of
california.
and
even
then
it
is
not
claimed
that
el
paso
had
the
power
to
exclude
entry
into
the
state
of
california
with
any
pipeline
project.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
have
already
noted
in
discussing
the
map,
since
the
commencement
of
this
action,
two
major
pipeline
systems
have
entered
the
state
of
california
and
there
is
one
already
proposed
and
--
before
the
federal
power
commission
for
action.
it
does
not,
i
believe
--
it
is
not,
i
believe,
claimed
that
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
there
was
any
active
competition
going
on
the
state
of
california
between
el
paso
and
pacific
northwest
or
any
other
company.
there
was
no
demand
at
that
time
to
be
satisfied.
and
there
was
no
opportunity
for
competition
at
that
time.
we
have
come
down
then
to
this
question,
as
i
understand
it
in
this
case
and
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
argue
it
yesterday.
was
the
result
of
this
acquisition
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
the
natural
gas
market
of
california
in
the
form
of
new
major
projects
of
the
magnitude
of
not
less
than
300
million
cubic
feet
a
day
over
a
period
of
say
20
years.
in
the
discussion
yesterday,
the
solicitor
general
did
not
analyze
the
present
state
of
the
california
market.
the
california
market
for
natural
gas
at
the
present
time
consist
or
its
consumptive
needs,
let
us
say,
and
its
consumption
of
gas
at
the
present
time,
consist
of
a
use
of
four
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day,
the
figures
which
i
give
are
approximate
but
they're
fairly
close.
two
billion
seven
hundred
and
fifty
million
cubic
feet
per
day
are
received
through
interstate
pipeline
systems.
the
balance
of
some
one
billion
three
hundred
million
cubic
feet
per
day
are
purchased
from
local
sources.
as
to
those
deliveries
which
are
interstate,
they
are
certificated,
deliveries
of
certificated
sales
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
are
we
--
agree
removed
from
the
area
of
competition
for
the
future.
nevertheless,
that
is
the
present
state
of
the
market.
and
we
therefore
looked
to
the
future,
if
we
look
at
all
for
any
further
competition.
the
important
thing
is
here
that
number
one,
it
is
incumbent,
if
the
government
is
to
prove
its
charge,
that
an
opportunity
will
arise
in
the
future
for
the
pacific
northwest
to
compete
had
it
remain
separate.
and
that
had
it
remain
separate,
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
could
have
afforded
effective
competition
with
respect
to
that
opportunity.
now,
our
answer
to
the
argument
of
the
government
in
summary
is
that
being
true
that,
in
the
first
place,
el
paso
natural
gas
company
did
not
dominate
the
california
market
at
anytime
in
view
of
the
fact
that
other
companies
have
entered
the
state
with
major
systems
since
the
suit
was
filed.
the
government
claims
on
the
one
hand
that
this
demonstrates
that
opportunities
were
opened
to
others
including
the
pacific
northwest
to
likewise
attempt
to
enter.
if
it
is
true
that
the
market
was
thus
open
to
concerns
generally
to
enter
into
a
competition
for
these
projects
present
or
future
then
it
is
certainly
true
that
anyone
of
a
score
or
more
of
willing
competitors
named
in
this
record
would
be
equally
qualified
so
to
do.
and
perhaps
anyone
of
the
owners
of
some
100
pipelines
that
are
described
in
the
federal
power
commission
exhibit
might
be
just
as
well
qualified
and
just
as
willing.
and
in
that
event,
the
entry
into
the
market
is
entirely
free.
and
the
elimination
of
pacific
northwest
could
have
no
possible
effect.
secondly,
we
argue
that
upon
the
record
in
this
case,
not
only
did
the
government
fail
to
bring
forth
evidence
of
any
reasonable
probability
of
entering
into
such
a
future
market
for
a
major
pipeline
enterprise
but
that
the
affirmative
evidence
shows
that
by
reason
of
the
financial
condition
of
the
pacific
northwest
company
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
by
reason
of
the
burdens
and
problems
which
confronted
it,
in
attending
to
its
own
market
in
the
northwest,
that
it
was
in
no
condition
to
undertake
such
an
enterprise.
and
third,
the
government
finally
retreats
to
the
position
covering
its
failure
of
proof
by
speculating
as
to
mere
possibilities
in
the
unidentified
future.
and
in
the
course
of
so
doing,
attempts
to
reverse
the
burden
of
proof.
the
natural
gas
is
a
wasting
natural
resource
and
an
important
source
of
energy.
it
is
divided
into
two
general
classifications
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
first,
there
is
residue
gas
which
is
produced
in
conjunction
with
the
production
of
oil
and
is
key
to
the
production
of
oil.
and
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
dry
gas
which
is
produced
independent
of
oil.
the
areas
of
production
of
natural
gas,
as
the
map
shows,
extend
in
a
general
way
from
louisiana
and
it
goes
through
texas,
oklahoma,
south
kansas,
through
the
rocky
mountains
to
canada
and
in
canada
through
alberta
and
british
columbia.
in
all
of
--
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
large
production
in
california
which
is
increasing
at
the
present
time.
all
of
the
owners
of
the
production
in
that
area
can
seek
their
own
markets
in
any
direction.
they
adopt
a
--
area
of
production
serves
the
principle
population
centers
of
the
united
states,
east
and
west.
and
the
producers,
85%
of
which
are
some
140
companies
and
consists
principally
the
major
oil
companies
of
the
country,
are
free
to
select
their
markets
just
as
the
markets
in
the
various
population
centers
are
free
to
compete
for
the
sources
of
production.
and
so,
one
of
the
facts
which
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
in
its
charge
in
this
case
was,
that
the
pacific
northwest
would
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
acquiring
the
character
of
undedicated
resources
necessary
to
serve
a
future
major
project.
and
the
minimum
described
by
counsel
would
require
undedicated
reserves
in
the
order
of
two
and
two
tenths
trillion
cubic
feet
in
the
ground.
and
as
we
would
later
point
out,
the
government
failed
to
make
that
proof
and
the
finding
of
the
court
was
against
it,
the
second
important
fact
with
respect
to
the
california
market
of
the
two
buyers.
there
were
only
two
buyers
of
interstate
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
california,
one
of
them,
the
great
utility,
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
in
northern
and
central
california
and
in
the
south
the
southern
companies.
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
is
the
exclusive
distributor
of
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
in
northern
and
central
california,
being
authorized
so
to
--
so
to
do
by
virtue
of
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
by
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california.
and
so
there
is
no
other
distributor
in
that
other
--
area
and
all
of
the
natural
gas,
whether
it
be
local
gas
or
interstate
gas,
is
purchased
by
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
and
it
is
the
only
buyer.
much
the
same
situation
prevails
in
the
southern
california.
there,
the
southern
companies
are
the
sole
distributors
of
natural
gas
with
minor
exceptions,
which
do
not
affect
the
general
statement.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
the
distributive
industrial
gas
to
the
two
principal
distributors
of
electric
energy
in
southern
california
to
witness
southern
california
edison
company
and
the
water
and
power
department
of
the
city
of
los
angeles.
the
result
of
that
is
that
all
interstate
gas
is
purchased
in
southern
california
by
the
southern
company
and
there
is
no
other
buyer
so
that
the
purchasers
of
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
california
exercise
or
can
exercise
complete
market
control,
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
in
the
north
and
the
southern
companies
in
the
south.
we
now
come
to
the
genesis
of
the
interstate
market
for
natural
gas
in
the
state
of
california.
before
1947,
there
were
no
sales
of
interstate
natural
gas
in
california.
up
to
that
time,
these
two
buyers
of
natural
gas
bought
all
of
their
supplies
within
the
borders
of
the
state
of
california.
however,
with
the
advent
of
world
war
ii
--
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
1947,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
the
advent
of
world
war
ii,
as
the
war
went
on
there
was
a
phenomenal
change
in
the
demand
for
natural
gas
in
california.
war
industry's
enormous
industrial
development
and
a
growth
in
population
estimated
by
the
united
states
census
bureau
has
42%
of
the
six
years
between
1942
and
1948
with
a
declining
supply
of
local
gas
at
that
time,
found
the
two
buyers
of
natural
gas
short
of
their
necessary
supplies.
and
so,
they
looked
beyond
the
borders
of
the
state
to
find
a
supply.
at
that
time,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
was
distributing
natural
gas
in
new
mexico
and
arizona.
these
two
buyers
in
california
approached
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
and
discussions
were
carried
on
over
a
period
of
two
years.
in
the
course
of
that
time,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
went
out
and
bought
enormous
quantities
of
wet
or
residue
gas,
which
at
that
time
was
for
the
greater
part,
being
wasted
in
the
air.
as
a
result,
they
were
able
to
get
together
a
project
and
entered
into
a
contract
in
1945
with
the
southern
companies
to
deliver
305
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
through
a
pipeline
system
to
be
built
from
lea
county
in
new
mexico
to
blythe
on
the
border
of
california.
within
two
years
thereafter,
a
similar
contract
was
made
with
the
pg
&
e
for
the
delivery
of
400
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
for
delivery
at
topock
on
the
border
of
california.
in
both
instances,
the
california
companies
took
delivery
at
the
border
and
transported
to
their
own
bank
transmission
systems,
all
of
that
natural
gas
to
the
centers
of
distribution.
the
result
was
that
by
1946,
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
had
committed
itself
to
deliver,
in
the
order
of
2
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day,
to
these
two
companies,
one-half
to
the
north
and
one-half
in
the
south.
up
to
this
time,
there
had
been
nothing
--
having
the
appearance
of
competition
does
not
appear
that
there
are
many
other
offerors
to
supply
the
gas
and
it
doesn't
appear
that
the
california
company
sought
anybody
else
to
provide
the
gas.
at
this
point,
i
would
think
it
appropriate
to
make
some
mention
of
the
effect
of
regulation
upon
the
market.
the
natural
gas
act,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
regulates
the
interstate
natural
gas
industry
in
many
aspects
including
the
regulation
of
rates.
but
the
important
aspect
to
which
we
wish
--
which
we
wish
to
mention
this
morning
is
the
regulation
under
section
7.
in
pursuance
of
which,
no
interstate
sales
of
natural
gas
for
resale
and
no
interstate
facilities
for
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
may
be
installed
or
constructed
without
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
federal
power
commission
upon
a
finding
that
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
such
a
finding
must
be
predicated
upon
evidence
showing
that
there
is
a
market
demand,
that
there's
and
adequate
supply
available,
that
the
project
is
feasible
and
that
the
applicant
is
financially
capable
of
carrying
it
to
a
conclusion.
in
addition
to
that,
the
other
provision
of
the
act
which
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
is
that
provision
which
provide
--
that
provision
which
restricts
the
operations
of
the
interstate
natural
gas
companies.
so
that
it
may
not
discontinue
the
use
of
any
facility,
the
giving
of
any
service
or
the
selling
of
any
gas
on
the
contract
without
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
federal
power
commission
holding
that
action
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
the
result
is
that
once
the
certificates
have
been
issued
and
the
installations
made
and
the
supply
contracts
initiated,
the
duty
is
upon
the
pipeline
company,
if
it's
a
pipeline
company,
to
continue
service
until
permitted
to
abandon
or
discontinue.
it
is
captive
to
its
market
and
the
market
buyer
is
captive
to
its
obligations
to
take
the
gas.
in
addition
to
that,
i
might
mention
that
since
1954,
the
hinshaw
amendment,
all
interstate
sales
in
california
must
likewise
be
approved
by
the
public
utilities
commission
because
the
main
transmission
lines
which
carry
all
of
the
natural
gas
from
the
border
to
the
centers
of
distribution
are
within
the
state
of
california.
i
--
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
all
of
the
supplies
that
were
delivered
to
california
in
pursuance
of
these
certificated
market
contracts
are
removed
from
the
area
of
effective
competition.
however,
this
--
as
another
aspect
to
wit
in
this
case
and
that
is
this,
once
or
more
times
in
the
brief
and
once
or
more
times
yesterday,
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
the
corporate
size
of
el
paso
natural
gas
company,
don't
he
mean
that
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
assets
in
the
order
of
a
billion
dollars.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
investment
was
necessary
in
order
to
acquire
the
supplies
which
were
dedicated
to
its
public
service.
they
were
necessary
in
order
to
build
and
to
maintain
the
installations
which
it
was
required
to
do
under
its
certificates.
and
that
that
investment
is
a
mere
incident
to
its
public
service
duty
and
the
certificated
contracts.
nor
is
that
size
too
notable
when
one
realizes
that
the
pacific
gas
&
electric,
its
northern
california
customer
has
assets
of
$2.5
billion
and
net
revenues
two
and
a
half
times
the
net
revenues
of
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
and
that
the
supplies
which
it
has
brought
from
many
of
the
major
oil
companies
are
from
oil
companies
which
have
a
corporate
size,
i
think
we
can
truly
agree,
for
an
excess
of
that
of
el
paso.
so
much
for
vagueness.
in
the
mean
time
before
1956,
the
northwest
pipeline
company
had
procured
a
certificate
to
serve
the
northwest
markets.
it
had
had
dedicated
to
it
gas
supplies
in
the
san
juan
basin
or
i
might
say
that
are
gas
leases
principally
dedicated
by
the
phillips
petroleum,
the
skelly
oil,
the
stanolind
oil
company
under
leases
which
required
it
to
develop
and
prove
the
reserves
in
the
ground
or
to
lose
their
rights
in
the
leases.
subsequently,
it
entered
into
a
contract
on
december
11th,
1954
for
the
purchase
of
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
of
canadian
gas
from
the
westcoast
transmission
company
and
that
supply
contract
was
certified.
and
that
supply
was
to
be
taken
at
sumas,
on
the
border
of
canada
and
the
state
of
washington.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
at
this
time,
the
pacific
northwest
was
confronted
with
an
undeveloped
market
and
with
sources
of
gas
supply
which
had
not
been
proven
and
it
had
all
of
the
problems
confronting
that
there
were
incident
to
that
situation.
suit
was
filed
in
1957
and
was
founded
principally
on
the
events
that
occurred
in
1956.
i
might
say
entirely,
and
because
of
much
that
what
said
yesterday
in
the
brief
about
the
edison
problem,
negotiations
of
pacific
northwest
with
edison,
i
would
like
to
review
that
story
briefly.
the
supply
of
gas
which
the
southern
companies
provide
to
the
southern
california
edison
company
are
limited
in
respect
to
the
right
of
the
southern
companies
to
discontinue
service
when
peak
load
demands
of
domestic
customers
require
it.
in
all
other
respects,
the
southern
companies
stand
ready
to
and
have
always
provided
all
of
the
gas
supplies
needed
by
the
southern
california
edison
company.
the
southern
california
edison
company
was
dissatisfied
with
the
intermittent
provision
of
its
gas
contracts
and
it
importuned
the
southern
companies
to
provide
them
with
the
firm
supply
and
it
importuned
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
in
proceedings
before
it
to
alter
the
situation
and
assure
it
supplies
which
will
not
subject
to
being
cutoff.
all
of
these
efforts
failed
and
so,
in
the
beginning
of
1956,
mr.
quentin,
the
president
of
the
edison
company
decided
to
go
out
and
seek
a
firm
supply
of
gas
out-of-state.
he
first
called
mr.
kayser,
the
president
of
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
and
mr.
kayser
told
him
that
he
was
very
loath
to
make
any
contract
for
a
direct
supply
of
gas
to
edison.
that
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
was
committed
to
furnish
a
billion
cubic
feet
a
day
to
the
southern
companies,
that
any
supply
which
he
might
sell
direct
to
edison
would
necessarily
be
taken
from
the
demand
of
the
southern
companies
which
was
then
supplying
the
edison
company.
and
this
would
result
in
either
facilities'
increased
costs
and
higher
rates
to
the
domestic
consumers.
sub
--
subsequently,
mr.
kayser,
as
it's
recited
in
the
letter
which
the
counsel
referred
to
yesterday
written
on
august
the
24th,
1956
to
the
edison
company,
procured
additional
supply
of
gas
in
louisiana
but
that
was
not
fruitful
because
the
gas
was
too
expensive
and
that
went
nowhere.
in
the
meantime,
after
having
discussed
prospects
for
bringing
interstate
gas
to
edison,
mr.
quentin
met
mr.
fish.
and
mr.
fish
undertook
to
put
together
a
plan
to
bring
the
out-of-state
gas
to
edison.
the
plan
that
was
involved
was
that
there
were
--
there
was
to
be
procured
from
canadian
sources
by
contract,
a
minimum
supply
of
300
million
cubic
feet
per
day
to
be
transported
by
the
westcoast
transmission
company
to
the
canadian
border,
to
be
transmitted
by
pacific
northwest
pipeline
from
the
canadian
border
to
klamath
falls
in
california
and
to
be
transported
by
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
to
its
center
of
distribution
at
antioch
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
to
supply
the
southern
companies
by
displacement.
on
july
the
30th,
1956,
a
tentative
memorandum
was
signed
by
mr.
fish
and
mr.
quentin.
one
that
was
termed
mr.
--
by
mr.
fish
a
"humping
license",
so
that
mr.
fish
could
hump
the
gas
in
canada
and
so
that
the
edison
company
could
hump
the
customers
in
california.
on
july
--
on
august
the
9th,
within
10
days
after
that,
mr.
sutherland,
the
president
of
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
advised
mr.
quentin
that
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
had
no
interest
in
the
project
whatever
because
it
intended
to
go
to
canada
for
its
own
supply
and
would
have
no
interest
in
the
project.
and
within
10
days
later,
the
southern
companies
likewise
indicated
that
they
had
no
interest
in
the
route
and
would
not
participate.
the
result
was
that
the
project
collapsed
completely
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
southern
california
edison
could
only
take
50
to
75
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
a
day
and
it
took
300
to
make
the
project
possible
so
there
were
no
buyers.
in
the
second
place,
it
required
the
use
of
pacific
gas
&
electric
facilities
to
bring
the
gas
from
northern
california
to
antioch
and
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
wouldn't
provide
the
transportation.
now,
it
would've
failed
inevitably
for
two
other
reasons.
it
was
contemplated
that
pacific
northwest
would
bring
canadian
gas
down.
but
the
canadian
gas
that
he
would've
--
would
have
brought
in
--
brought
down
never
materialized
and
does
not
materialize
to
this
date.
the
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
which
it
was
agreed
would
be
delivered
to
pacific
northwest
at
sumas
only
reach
250
million
cubic
feet
a
day
at
the
time
of
trial.
other
--
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
yes,
judge
goldberg.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
that
is
correct.
the
fact
is
that
to
the
present
day
not
only
has
--
have
the
canadians
suppliers
failed
to
come
up
to
their
original
commitment
of
300
million
cubic
feet
a
day
if
under
the
original
1954
contract
from
nine
years
ago.
but
when
the
el
paso
company
later,
to
support
a
twin
falls
project
entered
into
a
contract
to
purchase
400
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
to
be
delivered
at
kingsport,
it
was
not
forthcoming
for
a
long
time
and
finally
only
150
billion
cubic
feet
were
delivered.
and
that
is
being
delivered
into
the
northwest
markets
through
the
pgt
system
as
i've
mentioned
in
discussing
the
map.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
the
resources
in
canada
have
not
been
--
hap
--
unhappily
what
they
were
expected
to
be.
i
have
no
doubt
that
mr.
fish
believed
that
there
was
gas
in
canada
and
plenty
of
it.
i
have
no
doubt
the
el
paso
thought
there
was
a
great
deal
or
more
gas
in
canada
than
has
developed
and
simply
a
disappointing
result
of
canadian
reserves
which
i
suppose
is
coupled
with
three
elections
to
issue
export
permits.
point
--
the
point
of
this
whole
story
is
that
--
well,
pardon
me,
we
--
we
were
down
to
august
the
9th
and
august
the
20th.
now,
this
juncture
in
the
meantime,
mr.
kayser
had
discussed
for
the
southern
companies
some
proposal
by
which
the
edison
company
could
be
satisfied
by
cooperative
arrangement.
and
on
the
middle
of
august
of
1956,
the
southern
companies
advised
mr.
kayser
that
they
would
be
willing
to
cooperate
in
some
cooperative
enterprise
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
this
gas
to
market.
he
so
advised
to
mr.
quentin
by
letter
dated
august
the
24th,
1956
referred
to
by
counsel
and
i
would
be
happy
if
the
court
would
have
time
to
read
it
because
it
tells
the
story
i'm
now
telling
you.
he
met
with
mr.
quentin
and
as
a
result
of
that
on
october
2nd,
after
mr.
kayser
had
been
told
that
the
whole
pacific
northwest
proposal
had
collapsed
and
was
nonexistent,
proposed
a
tripartite
arrangement
by
which
100
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
would
be
sold
to
edison
to
be
brought
in
through
the
existing
facilities
of
el
paso
to
be
transported
to
the
edison
boilers,
to
the
facilities
of
the
southern
companies
with
a
reservation
to
the
southern
companies
of
a
minimum
need
for
peak
load
requirements.
that
ripened
into
a
contract.
that
contract
was
entered
into
before
the
acquisition
and
thus,
the
demand
of
edison
at
that
time
disappeared
from
the
picture.
but
as
we
pursue
the
story
further,
when
that
contract
of
el
paso
to
serve
edison
with
100
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
came
before
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
docket
12580,
the
commission
rejected
the
contract
upon
the
ground
that
to
serve
edison
directly
for
the
boiler
fuel
purposes
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
and
so,
that
100
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
again
was
relayed
to
the
southern
companies
and
it
was
left
to
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
to
decide
to
what
extent
the
supplies
of
the
edison
companies
should
be
intermittent.
furthermore,
after
the
case
in
docket
12580
was
decided,
the
edison
company
appealed.
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
it
went
to
texas
and
it
bought
its
own
source
of
supply
from
the
humble
oil
company
in
texas.
and
that
commitment
of
the
humble
oil
company
continues
to
this
day.
and
with
the
purchase
of
its
own
supply
from
the
humble
oil
company
in
texas,
the
edison
company
disappeared
completely
from
the
market.
and
we
return
to
the
proposition
that
--
that
there
always
have
been
and
still
are
and
will
continue
to
be
on
the
two
buyers
of
interstate
gas
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
the
future
growing
needs
of
california
for
gas?
counsel
estimates
and
spaced
upon
evidence
that
the
growing
need
for
natural
gas
in
california
is
at
the
rate
of
200
million
cubic
feet
a
day,
100
million
in
southern
california
and
100
million
in
--
in
northern
central
california.
that
is
the
estimate
at
the
time
of
trial
of
the
total
growth
but
i'm
afraid
that
counsel
is
under
the
misapprehension
that
that
total
growth
is
growth
and
demand
for
interstate
natural
gas
which
of
course
is
not
so,
that
is
the
estimated
total
growth.
and
is
the
estimated
total
growth
without
res
--
consideration
or
evaluation
of
the
undisputed
testimony
at
the
trial
that
there
are
enormous
increases
in
the
production
of
intrastate
gas
by
recently
very
large
discoveries
on
the
valleys
and
along
the
coast.
and
until
that,
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
consumed,
there's
no
out-of-state
of
demand
because
that
--
the
policy
of
both
companies
comes
first.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
outstanding,
a
capacity
of
not
less
than
1
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
through
existing
excess
facility
capacity,
600
million
through
the
enormous
line
of
the
pg
&
e
in
the
north
and
300
and
odd
million
through
the
excess
facilities
of
transwestern
in
the
south.
not
to
mention
one
additional
supplies
may
be
generated
by
looping
and
compression
on
the
el
paso
system.
and
concededly,
there
will
be
no
demand
for
a
new
project
to
california,
a
new
major
project
to
california
until
all
of
the
gas
available
at
the
incremental
cost
which
can
be
fixed
through
existing
capacities
are
satisfied.
it
is
said
by
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
rock
springs
case
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
any
need
for
an
out-of-state
project
in
california
at
least
until
after
1968.
and
when
we
tie
into
that,
the
fact
that
we
have
all
of
this
excess
capacity,
when
we
have
its
growing
development
in
the
production
of
natural
gas,
it
is
very
difficult
to
say.
when
the
time
will
come,
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
bring
to
california
a
new
major
interstate
gas
project.
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
that
the
undisputedly
evidences
record
is
that
the
competition
of
fuel
oil
is
rapidly
invading
the
industrial
markets
of
the
pg
&
e
and
the
southern
companies
to
such
an
extent
that
on
the
eve
before
the
trial,
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
lost
as
much
as
$5
million
in
revenue
to
industrial
use
of
fuel
oil
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
reduced
their
rate
at
the
expense
of
the
stockholders
to
try
to
hold
the
market.
so
from
such
sources
as
this,
it
is
clear
to
me,
then
one
cannot
say,
when
the
increasing
population
of
california,
when
the
increasing
demand
in
california
will
justify
economically
a
new
interstate
natural
gas
project.
have
i
answered
your
questions?
resuming
where
i
was
and
passing
docket
12580,
i
would
like
to
pass
now
to
the
purpose
of
the
--
in
effect
of
the
acquisition.
el
paso's
purpose
in
acquiring
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
stock
was
to
add
to
its
existing
gas
resources.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
again
to
the
difference
between
residue
gas
and
dry
gas.
as
i
have
pointed
out,
in
the
very
beginning,
el
paso
made
a
specialty
of
acquiring
large
quantities
of
residue
gas.
however,
residue
gas
then
was
very
cheap.
most
of
it
was
being
wasted.
and
el
paso
was
able
at
that
time
to
get
very
good
rates
on
the
purchase
of
this
wasting
gas.
what
--
the
use
of
this
residue
gas
involves
very
difficult
operating
problems
because
the
production
of
the
gas
in
the
oil
field
is
key
to
the
--
key
to
the
production
of
oil
and
not
to
the
need
for
gas.
i
don't
know
of
states
where
there
is
rationing
of
production
is
also
keyed
to
the
rationing
of
the
production
of
oil.
this
results
in
enormous
fluctuations
in
the
daily
availability
of
residue
gas
to
a
point
where
it
has
gone
as
far
as
a
variation
of
500
million
cubic
feet
in
a
single
day.
and
the
only
way
to
balance
this
problem
was
to
attempt
to
procure
a
dry
gas.
and
so,
el
paso
was
seeking
the
best
of
its
ability
to
acquire
dry
gas
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition.
in
addition
to
that,
the
federal
power
commission
had,
on
several
occasions,
questioned
the
sufficiency
of
the
supply
of
gas
generally
in
its
reserve
to
resupply
the
market
commitments
which
it
had
made.
it
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
decisions
of
the
commission
that
el
paso
was
expending
gas
at
the
rate
of
a
trillion
cubic
feet
a
year.
and
that
if
it
was
to
maintain
its
position
and
unable
it
to
thoroughly
go
through
with
its
obligations,
it
would
be
necessary
for
it
to
acquire
additional
supplies.
on
the
other
hand,
the
pacific
northwest
had
these
leases
which
had
been
committed
to
it
by
the
oil
companies,
principally
the
phillips
petroleum
company
in
the
san
juan
area.
it
was
believed
that
there
were
promising
prospects
of
procuring
additional
gas
in
canada
and
there
was
hope
that
by
opening
up
the
areas
in
the
rocky
mountain
districts,
that
for
the
gas
supplies
would
be
found.
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
el
paso
in
acquiring
stock
of
pacific
northwest
was
to
acquire
these
supplies
and
the
reserves.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
sufficiently
successful
in
that
regard
so
that
ultimately
in
the
final
disposal
of
docket
number
12580,
the
commission
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
had
accomplished
its
purpose.
and
mr.
laurence,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
southern
--
one
of
the
southern
companies
testified
that
a
review
by
various
companies
indicated
that
el
paso
had
acquired
sufficient
reserves
if
no
more
than
necessary
to
carry
through
its
service
contracts.
now,
i
did
not
understand
at
all
that
there
was
any
question
about
this
being
the
purpose
of
the
acquisition.
the
court
so
found
no
other
purpose
has
ever
been
suggested
that
i
know
except
the
reference
yesterday
to
the
subject
of
southern
california
edison
and
that
we
have
disposed
of.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
disposes
also
the
question
of
vagueness
if
vagueness
has
a
place
because
the
purpose
was
to
serve
the
contracts
which
the
pacific
northwest
that
had
in
this
market
to
protect
the
reserves
which
el
paso
had
in
this
market.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
--
has
no
anticompetitive
objective.
i
might
say
that
it
served
its
purpose.
they
might
say
that
not
only
did
they
acquire
these
reserves
but
they
acquire
the
flexibility
of
operation
which
maximize
the
use
of
those
reserves
by
enabling
them
to
use
southern
supplies
of
gas
to
meet
peak
demands
of
the
north
and
northern
supplies
of
gas
to
meet
peak
demands
in
the
south.
they
were
able
to
firm
up
their
dry
gas
to
point
where
they
have
50%
dry
gas
as
against
50%
residue
gas,
then
have
been
able
to
maintain
rates
in
their
markets
in
california
far
below
the
price
of
any
other
gas
sold
in
california,
whether
it'd
be
intrastate
or
interstate
and
far
below
the
price
of
any
gas
that's
ever
been
offered
to
the
state
of
california.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
no,
there
was
practically
no
reference
made
to
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
trial
in
the
district
court,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
did
not
appear
there.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
no,
they
have
not.
i
--
you
will
recall
that
they
passed
upon
these
questions
once
before.
but
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
hardly
seemed
appropriate
to
introduce
any
of
the
matters
before
the
federal
power
commission
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
what
has
happened
now
since
1957?
in
the
first
place,
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
went
to
canada
and
acquired
its
supplies,
created
its
corporate
agent,
the
pacific
gas
transmission
company
and
is
now
bringing
and
has
been
bringing
400
million,
15
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
to
its
market
with
an
excess
capacity
of
some
600
million
cubic
feet.
thereby,
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
passed
out
of
the
market
and
the
market
in
northern
and
central
california
disappeared
as
a
market
for
any
future
project
of
an
independent
company
to
bring
interstate
gas
to
northern
california.
in
that
connection,
it
will
be
noted
not
merely
that
it
went
to
canada.
what
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
established
the
firm
policy
in
1956
that
it
would
find
its
own
supplies,
whether
it'd
be
in
the
gulf,
in
texas
or
in
canada
or
elsewhere.
and
so,
there
is
no
future
market
or
an
interstate
project
to
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
or
to
northern
california
by
any
independent
company.
in
the
meantime,
the
southern
companies
had
gone
out
to
get
additional
gas,
had
selected
supplies
of
principally
the
gulf
oil
company
in
texas
and
new
mexico,
entered
into
contracts
to
buy
supplies
of
gas
from
them
without
so
far
as
the
record
indicates,
any
offer
to
others
or
any
invitation
for
others
to
bid.
and
the
result
was
that
the
gulf
oil
and
warren
oil
interest
created
their
own
corporate
instrumentality
to
transwestern
pipeline
company
which
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
not
less
than
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
to
the
southern
companies.
and
it
built
its
--
and
sold
its
facilities
with
an
excess
capacity
--
of
an
excess
of
300
million
cubic
feet
per
day.
in
the
meantime,
the
southern
companies
decided
to
explore
for
their
own
sources
of
gas.
and
they
have
now
acquired
substantial
acreage
in
the
rocky
mountain
areas
with
promising
indications
that
they
will
be
able
to
develop
their
own
independent
supply.
in
which
event,
there
will
be
no
future
market
in
california
for
any
independent
project.
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
company
has
become
a
vertically
integrated
gas
company
from
production
of
gas
to
the
consumer
tip.
and
if
the
southern
companies
follow
the
same
procedure,
the
same
thing
will
happen.
and
so,
notwithstanding
the
growing
need
of
california
for
gas
in
the
future,
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
there
will
be
any
market
for
the
pacific
northwest,
el
paso
or
any
other
independent
company.
and
if
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
of
a
market
for
the
gas
as
some
reasonably
certain
future
date,
i
submit,
the
--
the
charge
of
the
government
must
fall.
there
are
other
people
who
sought
to
enter
the
market
here.
and
if
the
government
takes
the
position
which
it
took
at
one
point
yesterday,
that
not
only
pacific
northwest
but
some
other
concern
could
come
forward
and
obtain
gas
and
seek
to
enter
the
market,
may
we
point
out
that
other
reasonably
well
qualified
companies
have
made
the
same
offers.
the
southern
union
gas
company
which
has
pipeline
installations
and
resources
in
the
san
juan
basin
has
offered
to
supply
california.
the
westcoast
transmission
company,
which
provides
all
of
the
canadian
supplies
of
the
pacific
northwest,
have
offered
sale
to
california.
the
colorado
interstate
company,
in
connection
with
the
project
at
rock
springs,
offered
to
sell
200
million
cubic
feet
from
the
panhandle
and
permian
basin
to
california.
these
are
all
pipeline
companies.
they're
all
just
as
close
to
california
as
pnw.
what
if
beyond
that?
there
are
--
and
we
do
not
agree
by
the
way
that
this
is
the
proper
test
of
competition.
we
do
not
agree
that
the
mere
willingness
to
come
in
and
attempt
to
serve
--
constitutes
genuine
competition.
we
insist
that
the
proper
rule
is
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
probability
of
becoming
an
effective
competitor
or
the
charge
of
the
government
is
not
established.
but
there
are
large
number
of
other
companies
who
are
perfectly
willing
to
sell,
a
score
of
them
in
the
record.
and
any
number
could
be
selected
among
the
other
pipeline
companies
in
the
country
who
perhaps
would
be
only
too
willing
to
propose.
but
pacific
northwest
in
contrast
to
the
others
were
under
--
was
under
a
great
stability.
in
the
first
place,
it
found
itself
with
leases
to
drill
and
to
protect
as
mr.
fish
put
it.
it
required
immediately
money
in
the
nature
of
$30
or
$40
or
$50
million
at
once
and
they
had
no
place
to
get
it.
they
had
no
gas
to
supply
their
market
with,
had
it
not
been
that
el
paso
furnished
them
with
a
supply
for
the
first
five
years
of
their
activities
to
be
returned
to
el
paso
beginning
the
seventh
year.
they
had
no
supplies
in
canada
or
the
san
juan
basin
to
offer
to
edison.
their
financial
condition
was
such
that
they
lost
substantial
moneys
in
the
first
year,
1957
and
over
a
three-year
period.
out
of
an
estimated
earnings
of
$23.5
million,
they
earned
$22
--
they
--
they
failed
to
earn
22.
the
testimony
was
that
the
financial
condition
of
that
company
was
such
but
there
was
no
expectation
that
it
could
launch
a
major
product
--
project
for
as
far
down
the
line
as
one
could
see.
and
this
was
the
testimony
of
its
then
president
or
the
president
at
the
time
that
this
occurred,
mr.
silloway.
now,
some
reference
is
made
yesterday
to
the
proximity
of
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline
in
california
so
that
were
some
advantage.
we
find
it
a
little
bit
difficult
to
understand
that
contention
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
did
said
that
the
pipeline
of
el
paso
entering
california
is
no
advantage.
the
pipeline
of
pacific
northwest
was
just
truly
dedicated
to
the
northwest
as
the
pipeline
of
el
paso
was
dedicated
to
california.
and
the
proximity
of
the
pipeline
has
no
particular
relevancy
to
the
problem.
it's
not
the
proximity
of
the
pipeline.
it's
the
availability
of
undedicated
adequate
supplies
within
the
economic
reach
of
the
market.
and
thus,
it
was
held
in
the
rock
springs
case
that
the
200
million
cubic
feet
a
day
and
the
colorado
interstate
were
too
far
from
the
market.
although,
those
supplies
were
to
take
off
from
rock
springs
on
the
old
pacific
northwest
line.
and
facilities
of
the
westcoast
transmission
are
just
as
close
to
california
as
those
of
the
pacific
northwest.
the
fact
is
that
--
there
was
certain
furtherance
which
the
government
assumed
when
it
brought
its
charge
here.
it
was
its
burden
as
we
see
it
to
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
of
competition
to
the
state
of
california.
i
do
not
know
from
the
argument
yesterday
whether
counsel
has
changed
his
market
from
california
to
southern
california
because
he
didn't
mention
northern
california
in
the
cause
of
his
remarks.
but
the
burden
which
they
had
to
establish
was,
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
acquisition
and
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
competition
either
in
california
or
in
southern
california.
in
order
to
accomplish
that,
there
were
certain
very
definite
matters
of
proof
which
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
establish.
first,
that
the
pacific
northwest
would
be
interested
in
going
to
california.
now,
we
submit
that's
a
purely
conjectural
matter
to
say
that
the
pacific
northwest
because
it
made
one
futile
effort
in
1956,
completely
frustrated,
would
10
or
15
years
later,
decide
again
to
attempt
to
go
to
california
is
pure
surmised.
what
they
would
decide
to
do
15
or
20
years
or
30
years
hence
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
as
they
then
presented
themselves
to
the
management.
among
other
things,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
they
could
obtain
the
necessary
undedicated
supplies.
it
would
depend
upon
whether
they
care
to
invest
in
those
supplies
and
in
the
project
and
why
--
why
the
california
market?
why
not
the
chicago
market?
pacific
northwest
tried
to
go
in
chicago
market
once
and
failed
just
as
it
failed
in
california.
why
not
any
other
market
within
the
economic
reach
or
whatever
supply
it
could
find?
so
much
for
the
conjecture,
we'd
try
to
go
to
california.
next,
it
would
be
necessary
to
establish
that
some
california
distributor,
one
or
two,
either
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
or
the
southern
companies
could
be
interested
in
the
project
to
be
put
forward.
and
we
submit
there
was
no
evidence
to
indicate
any
such
consideration
and
the
record
as
it
in
the
past,
it
had
been
rejected
completely
by
both
companies,
not
only
the
route
but
the
company.
next,
it
would
be
necessary
to
establish
the
pacific
northwest
had
a
reasonable
probability
of
procuring
the
necessary
undedicated
supplies
and
reserves.
as
i
have
already
said,
the
supplies
and
reserves
which
it
attempted
to
procure
never
did
materialize.
is
it
necessary
to
establish
that
the
pacific
northwest
would
have
the
financial
ability
to
be
a
serious
competitor?
and
in
that
respect
to
have
overcome
all
of
its
financial
difficulties
and
obstacles.
but
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
it
would
every
have
overcome
them.
and
finally
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
pacific
northwest
pipeline,
as
a
separate
entity,
could,
at
some
future
date,
put
together
a
project
having
some
reasonable
prospect
of
favorable
consideration
by
the
buyer
and
by
each
of
the
two
regularity
bodies.
we
do
not
say
and
the
court
did
not
say,
it
did
not
attempt
to
pass
upon
the
question
whether
in
the
last
analysis
any
particular
project
of
any
particular
entrepreneur-promoter
would
or
would
not
be
approved
by
any
promoter.
but
the
burden
was
not
upon
us
to
prove
that
it
could
not
be
obtained.
it
was
not
upon
us
to
prove
that
the
project
must
fail.
it
was
not
upon
us
to
prove
that
they
couldn't
compete.
it
was
upon
the
plaintiff
who
made
the
charge
of
violation
of
section
7
to
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
of
these
things
occurring
in
the
future.
and
it's
at
this
point
that
the
government
changes
its
position
and
attempts
to
rescue
a
case
in
which
it
has
introduced
virtually
no
evidence.
it
is
here
i
think
that
the
government
states
that
it
is
hardly
proper
to
consider
matters
of
this
kind
in
the
frame
of
reference
of
the
early
future.
implicitly,
the
government
yields
to
the
argument
that
competition
would
not
have
occurred
in
the
past.
that
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
that
would've
occurred
in
the
years
up
to
this
date,
if
you
please,
or
even
in
the
few
years
that
lie
ahead.
but
while
implicitly
conceding
that,
the
united
states
then
receives
into
the
prediction
that
the
longer
we
look
ahead,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
substantial
competition
will
arise.
that
pacific
northwest
would
somehow,
in
the
long
years
to
come,
acquire
the
financial
ability,
have
the
opportunity
and
become
an
effective
competitor.
what
they
attempt
to
do
here
is
to
say
we
cannot
prove
anything
as
of
now
or
as
of
the
early
future
what
--
by
--
by
projecting
the
whole
problem
into
the
unforeseeable
future,
we
are
--
we're
to
leave
the
necessity
of
proof.
and
it
is
then
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
produce
proof
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
yes,
but
--
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
yes,
that's
right.
i
think
i
am.
mr.
gregory
a.
harrison
i
can
only
say
that
as
we
understand
the
argument
of
the
government
that
it
seems
to
us
to
be
reduced
to
the
area
of
surmise
and
conjecture
and
nothing
else.
counsel
said
yesterday,
as
i
recall
it,
that
there
was
something
between
probability
and
conjecture.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
all
conjecture
and
no
probability
because
there
was
no
evidence
to
sustain
any
probability
or
any
finding
of
probability
in
this
case.
may
i
point
out
also
what
counsel
said
yesterday
when
he
was
interrogated
on
that
very
question,
that
it
was
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
question
should
be
left
to
the
test
of
the
marketplace
in
the
future.
now,
that
would
mean,
may
it
please
the
court,
which
should
be
left
to
the
market,
test
to
the
marketplace
in
the
future,
the
decree
of
divestiture
must
automatically
be
entered
without
evidence
so
that
the
pacific
northwest
will
remain
separate
and
the
--
the
test
of
the
marketplace
of
the
future
read
the
guide
and
that
eliminates
all
necessity
for
evidence.
and
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
brought
a
suit
and
asked
the
trial
court,
if
you
please,
to
make
a
finding
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
this
effective
competition
would
arise
in
the
future.
and
how
he
can
say
on
the
one
hand,
i'm
asking
the
court
to
find
that
there's
a
reasonable
probability
of
substantial
competition,
the
natural
gas
market
in
california
and
say
we
must
leave
it
to
the
future
market
to
test
it.
i
simply
do
not
understand.
all
that
happened
was
that
the
trial
court
made
an
entirely
different
finding
than
that
which
the
government
asked.
it
may
define
and
there
was
no
such
probability
at
the
present,
in
the
earlier
future
or
at
anytime
at
all.
and
if
one
will
look
at
the
last
page
of
the
brief
of
the
government
here,
it
would
be
seen
that
the
questions
are
cast
in
the
negative.
it
is
not
a
question
as
these
questions
are
posed
on
the
last
page
of
the
brief
whether
the
government
has
proved
something
or
failed
to
prove
something,
the
question
is
whether,
if
you
please.
the
court
or
the
defendants
can't
speculate
that
competition
will
not
arise
in
the
future.
whereas
as
i,
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
speculation
is
all
on
the
part
of
the
government.
it
is
the
government
which
speculates
and
then
reverses
the
whole
procedure
by
saying
that
we
speculate
and
the
court
speculates
when
it
finds
against
the
plaintiff.
