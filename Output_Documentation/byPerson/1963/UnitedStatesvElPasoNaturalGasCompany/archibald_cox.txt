mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
major
antitrust
case
in
which
the
government
attacks
the
merger
of
two
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
acquiring
company
is
el
paso
natural
gas
company,
which
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
was
one
of
the
two
largest
natural
gas
companies
in
the
country
and
which
was
then
the
only
company
actually
supplying
natural
gas
--
interstate
natural
gas
to
california.
the
acquired
company
is
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company,
then
the
only
large
interstate
natural
gas
company
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
a
company
which
was
seeking
to
enter
the
california
market.
another
aspect
of
the
litigation
growing
out
of
this
merger
was
here
two
years
ago
when
the
court
held
that
set
aside
in
order
of
the
federal
power
commission,
on
the
ground
that
it
should
not
have
preceded
to
approve
the
merger
while
an
antitrust
complaint
was
being
prosecuted
by
the
department
of
justice
in
the
district
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
acquisition
itself
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
because
it
was
an
acquisition
which
may
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
the
--
in
promoting
projects
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
to
california.
the
essential
facts,
at
least
the
outline
of
the
facts
is
really
quite
simple.
we
start
with
the
california
market
for
natural
gas
which
was
an
--
an
immense
and
very
rapidly
expanding
market.
in
1950
for
example,
six
years
before
the
merger,
the
consumption
was
684
million
cubic
feet
daily.
in
1955,
it
was
one
billion
cubic
feet
daily.
in
1960,
1.3
billion,
in
1965,
it's
estimated
it'll
be
1.6
billion
and
in
1970,
two
billion
cubic
feet
daily.
it's
increasing
in
other
words
at
an
annual
rate
of
approximately
200
million
cubic
feet
a
day,
much
the
most
dynamic
as
i
understand
it
in
the
country.
more
than
half
of
california's
consumption
comes
from
out-of-state.
it's
been
50%,
61%
and
it
can
be
expected
in
all
probability,
but
with
no
certainty
to
continue
to
be
more
than
half.
natural
gas
is
a
principal
source
of
energy,
it
being
dependent
on
interstate
pipelines.
california's
concern
that
it
should
not
receive
all
its
gas
from
one
company
or
that
it
should
be
dependent
even
on
one
or
two
suppliers,
is
a
very
natural
one.
it's
one
that's
been
often
expressed,
the
federal
power
commission
and
expressed
here
before
this
court.
el
paso,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
was,
as
i
have
said,
one
of
the
largest
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
in
the
country
in
--at
assets
of
just
under
a
billion
dollars,
903
million.
its
pipelines
are
shown
on
this
separate
map
that
i
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
only
because
it
was
a
convenient
way
of
showing
where
these
two
companies
run.
i
think,
if
anyone
started
looking
in
some
of
the
details,
he
might
be
misled,
and
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
show
the
main
outlines.
el
paso,
you'll
see,
is
marked
in
red.
its
pipelines
run
from
the
san
juan
basin,
a
natural
gas
basin
in
southwest
in
colorado
and
northwest
in
new
mexico,
the
texas
panhandle
and
the
permian
basin
in
west
texas,
out
to
the
california
border.
at
the
california
border,
the
gas
is
picked
up
either
by
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
which
is
a
distribution
company
that
has
virtually
a
monopoly
of
the
distribution
of
gas
in
northern
california
or
by
what
are
known
as
the
southern
companies,
two
affiliated
companies
which
have
virtually
a
monopoly
of
the
distribution
of
gas
in
southern
california.
pacific
northwest
was
incorporated
in
1959
and
was
certificated
in
1954,
initially
with
a
view
to
serving
the
northwestern
states,
washington,
oregon,
idaho,
utah.
its
pipeline,
you
will
see,
is
marked
in
blue.
it
runs
from
a
connection
with
canadian
companies
at
the
border
at
sumas,
washington
down
paralleling
the
western
edge
of
the
rocky
mountains,
down
to
the
san
juan
basin.
pacific
northwest
had
four
assets
or
advantages
that
are
worthy
of
note.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
unique,
i
think,
and
that
it
had
access
both
to
the
canadian
gas
which
was
becoming
of
increasing
importance
and
to
the
san
juan
basin,
another
important
source
of
gas.
it
lay
adjacent
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
therefore
adjacent
to
important
future
reserves
of
gas,
which
were
then
beginning
to
be
developed.
having
gas
fields
in
either
end,
this
was
a
flexible
line,
the
line
could
be
--
the
gas
could
be
made
to
flow
in
either
direction
or
from
the
two
ends
to
some
point
in
the
center
where
it
might
be
carried
off
by
a
bridge
line.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
as
these
things
go,
while
pacific
northwest
had
no
line
to
california,
it
was
not
far
from
the
california
market.
i
should
say
in
that
connection,
to
avoid
any
possible
confusion
that
these
two
little
orange
lines
going
off
from
pacific
northwest,
one
running
south
through
oregon
and
the
other
running
across
to
nevada,
ought
to
be
disregarded.
they
are
little
bitsy
pipelines
and
they
have
no
earthly
importance
in
this
proceeding
or
is
a
possible
bridges
from
pacific
to
california.
and
if
we'd
had
some
convenient
way
to
eliminate
them,
i'd
have
stricken
them
right
off
the
map.
almost
from
the
time
of
its
incorporation
and
certainly
from
the
time
of
its
certification,
pacific
had
a
very
real
interest
in
the
california
market.
in
1954,
it
engaged
in
discussions
with
pacific
gas
and
electric,
with
the
view
to
bring
down
a
supply
of
gas
from
canada.
later
that
year,
those
preliminary
conversations
gave
way
to
an
agreement
between
pacific,
el
paso,
and
the
canadian
company,
westcoast
transmission
company,
to
impart
300
million
cubic
feet
a
day
through
mountain
home,
idaho
which
would
be
a
point
about
halfway
on
pacific's
line
through
idaho
and
then
to
bring
that
gas
down
probably
through
reno
to
california.
again
i
say
the
orange
line
has
nothing
to
do
that
--
with
that
although
it's
about
the
location.
that
agreement
was
described
by
one
of
pacific's
officers
in
a
report
to
a
stockholder
as
having
this
effect.
el
paso's
california
market
will
be
protected
against
future
competition.
and
if
the
agreement
results
in
all
parties
now
working
together
for
a
common
end
rather
than
fighting
each
other.
this
was
only
a
plan.
the
agreement
had
been
signed
but
it
was
felt
through
because
the
distribution
companies
refused
to
take
the
gas
at
the
point
at
which
the
transmission
companies
wanted
to
lever
--
to
deliver
it
to
california.
then
in
1956,
as
i
shall
describe
in
more
detail
later,
pacific
negotiated
with
southern
california
edison,
a
large
user
of
gas
and
reached
a
tentative
agreement
on
july
30,
1956
to
impart
gas
to
california,
building
a
pipeline,
provided
that
a
--
another
purchaser
along
with
edison
could
be
found.
mr.
archibald
cox
1954
--
there
was
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
very
preliminary
discussions
in
1954,
then
there's
1954,
a
three-way
deal.
i
think
it
fell
through
during
1954.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
fell
through
because
the
southern
companies
wouldn't
take
it
at
the
point
of
delivery
that
el
paso
wanted
to
deliver
it,
having
brought
it
down
through
westcoast
transmission
in
part
of
pacific's
line.
they
wanted
to
deliver
it
farther
north
than
they
would
take
it.
it
fell
through
in
1955.
it
would've
been
before
these
discussions
with
edison.
as
i
say,
i
shall
refer
to
the
discussions
with
edison
at
more
length
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
it's
worth
noting
that
when
the
president
of
el
paso
learned
of
the
negotiations
between
the
pacific
and
edison,
he
went
to
edison,
told
edison
that
he
knew
about
the
negotiations,
that
he
wanted
to
hold
the
market
there
in
southern
california
which
he
had
all
up
at
that
time,
and
was
prepared
to
supply
it,
and
that
he
would
resist
the
efforts
of
anybody
else
to
come
in.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
i
haven't
mentioned
that
yet.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
still
another
proposal
that
involved
the
perspective
use
of
canadian
gas.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
in
fact
all
that
i
have
mentioned
would
have
required
the
construction
of
a
line
taking
off
somewhere
from
pacific's
line
to
california.
i'll
explain
that
more
length
in
a
few
minutes.
el
paso's
interest
in
acquiring
pacific
and
indeed
its
negotiations
to
acquire
pacific
commenced
almost
as
soon
as
pacific
had
a
certificate
to
build
this
pipeline.
el
paso
made
studies
in
1955
and
in
december
1955,
it
made
an
offer
to
acquire
all
of
pacific's
stock,
giving
five
of
each
share
for
every
nine
of
pacific's.
that
offer
was
rejected.
in
1956,
while
pacific
was
negotiating
with
edison,
el
paso
picked
up
and
pacific
picked
up
the
previous
negotiations
for
a
merger.
on
november
8,
1956,
an
agreement
was
closed
whereby
el
paso
was
to
surrender
seven
of
each
gift
--
seven
of
each
shares
for
every
eight
shares
of
pacific.
that
agreement
was
complete
--
well,
it
was
completed
on
that
date.
it
was
carried
out
during
the
ensuing
months.
by
may
1957,
el
paso
had
acquired
99
and
a
fraction
percent
of
the
stock
of
pacific.
in
july
1957,
the
department
of
justice
started
this
suit
against
el
paso,
complaining
that
the
merger
violated
section
7
and
seeking
ultimately
an
order
requiring
el
paso
to
divest
itself
from
the
stock.
el
paso
then
decided
to
acquire
all
the
assets
of
pacific.
the
theory,
i
take
it,
was
that
while
the
stock
acquisition
did
not
require
the
approval
of
a
--
the
federal
power
commission,
an
asset
acquisition
would
require
its
approval
and
then
approval
in
turn,
the
lawyer's
thought,
would
result
in
immunizing
the
acquisition
under
the
clayton
act.
the
federal
power
commission
did
approve
the
acquisition.
the
order
was
then
brought
here
by
the
state
of
california
and
this
court
set
--
assigned
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
holding
first
that
the
federal
power
commission
should
not
have
proceeded
while
the
antitrust
case
was
pending.
and
also
holding
squarely,
that
federal
power
commission
approval
of
an
asset
acquisition
does
not
give
any
immunity
under
the
antitrust
laws,
so
that
the
order
was
wiped
out
and
the
way
was
cleared
for
trial
in
the
district
court
in
this
case.
now,
the
two
or
three
events
that
occurred
after
the
merger,
that
i
think
it
would
be
convenient
to
explain
at
this
point
because
we
will
be
referring
to
them
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
one,
mr.
justice
brennan,
relates
to
this
dotted
line
that
you
mentioned
earlier.
that
represents
what
was
known
as
the
rock
springs
project.
that
was
a
project
developed
by
el
paso
after
the
merger
for
bringing
gas
from
a
number
of
sources
into
california
to
meet
an
expected
increment
in
the
california
demand.
some
of
the
gas
that
would
have
been
used
in
that
project
would
have
come
from
canada
through
pacific's
pipelines,
but
not
all
of
it.
some
of
it
was
clearly
dependent
upon
that
gas
that
el
paso
would
have
provided
from
sources
not
available
to
pacific,
but
some
of
it
was
also
canadian
gas
and
i
shall
argue
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
hadn't,
i
was
going
to
say
it
in
the
next
sentence.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
question
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
--
i'm
just
saying
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
these
are
mostly
planned.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
question
about
that.
this
has
never
been
--
has
been
disapproved.
it's
in
a
sense
perhaps
openness
and
alternative
because
it
was
held
over
to
be
considered
if
el
paso
cared
to
resubmit
it,
along
with
several
other
alternate
applications
for
certifications,
but
it's
not
been
built.
the
other
events
that
i
want
to
mention
are
the
entry
of
one
pipeline
into
california
and
an
effort
by
another
to
get
in.
transwestern
pipeline
company,
since
the
merger
has
built
a
line.
if
you
look
at
the
northern
division
of
el
paso
and
find
the
little
black
number
97,
you
will
see
its
line
which
roughly
parallels
el
paso's
normal
division.
that
is
a
line
that
carries
gas
to
the
southern
companies
at
the
california
boarder
and
indeed
it
has
a
good
deal
of
excess
capacity.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that's
not
an
el
paso
company.
that's
an
independent
company
and
one
which
mr.
harrison
will
argue,
introduces
no
end
of
competition
into
the
market.
we
have
our
doubts
but
it's
there
as
a
company
and
it's
an
independent
company.
in
addition,
there
has
been
proposed
and
will
be
ruled
upon
by
the
federal
power
commission
some
time
in
the
not
too
distant
future,
justice
stewart,
another
application
by
gulf
pacific,
which
wishes
to
build
a
pipeline
across
the
southwest,
the
exact
route
is
immaterial,
carrying
gas
to
southern
california.
so
that
those
are
events
that
occurred
after
the
merging
that
were
entered,
that
it
was
--
were
proved
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court.
after
the
case
went
back,
the
district
court
received
evidence,
some
oral,
parts
of
it
from
the
record
in
these
previous
proceedings.
and
after
hearing
argument
announced
for
the
bench
that
he
would
rule
against
the
prosecution
that
there
was
no
violation
of
section
7,
directed
the
defendant
to
prepare
findings
of
fact
of
conclusion
which
i
understand
were
submitted
--
were
signed
as
the
defendant
submitted
them
and
then
we
brought
the
case
here.
the
question
presented
as
we
see
it
is
solely
one
of
law.
we
do
not
attack
any
i
think,
certainly
not
more
than
one
of
the
findings
as
unsupported
by
the
evidence.
we
argue
that
a
number
of
the
conclusions
rest
on
a
misconception
of
the
principles
governing
the
application
of
section
7.
we
argue
that
a
number
of
the
other
findings
as
i
shall
explain
are
irrelevant
because
they
missed
the
essential
point
because
of
an
error
of
law.
but
we
do
not
seek
to
go
back
of
what
is
undisputed
evidence.
our
case
rests
essentially
on
two
propositions.
first,
we
say
that
competition
in
the
pipeline
industry
consists
of
rivalry
in
promoting
future
projects
to
transport
and
deliver
large
quantities
of
gas
for
a
long
period,
20
years
or
more
on
the
average
often
through
facilities
to
be
constructed
and
beginning
some
time
in
the
future,
two,
three
and
perhaps
as
far
away
as
five
years.
in
other
words,
this
isn't
simply
the
sale
of
units
of
gas
today
to
be
delivered
tomorrow.
it
looks
to
long-term
projects
to
bring
gas
to
a
market.
second,
bearing
in
mind
the
nature
of
competition,
we
submit
that
el
paso's
acquisition
of
what
was
then
the
only
major
pipeline
company
west
of
the
rocky
and
seeking
to
enter
the
california
market,
a
company
which
was
actively
seeking
to
enter
the
california
market
made
such
a
change
in
the
structure
of
the
market,
as
to
require
as
a
matter
of
law
the
conclusion
that
it
would
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
let
me
first
say
just
a
word
more
about
the
nature
of
competition
in
this
industry.
as
i
say,
what
we
think
it
consist
of
and
i
don't
think
that
the
defendants,
the
appellees
disagree,
is
the
promotion
of
rival
projects
among
producers,
one
end
of
the
bridge
and
among
users
or
distributing
companies
at
the
other
ends
of
the
bridge,
to
put
together
links
bringing
the
necessary
gas
to
the
market,
and
then
to
secure
the
approval
of
the
federal
power
commission.
it's
quite
different
from
competition
in
the
sale
of
shoes
to
shoe
stores
located
in
the
same
neighborhood
are
engaged
in
selling
shoes
that
they
have
in
stock,
the
costumers
now
for
delivering
either
immediately
or
in
a
very
short
time
in
the
future.
even
shoe
manufacturers,
while
they
are
selling
next
season's
supply
to
the
retailer
still
are
selling
shoes
which
are
either
manufactured
or
very
shortly
to
be
manufactured,
they're
to
be
delivered,
a
few
lots.
they're
not
engaged
in
competition
that
constructs
and
operate
shoe
factories
over
a
long
period
of
years.
here,
the
gas
sold
today
is
not
sold
in
competition.
it
wouldn't
be
sold
in
competition
even
if
there
were
10
pipelines
leading
into
california.
the
gas
that
el
paso
is
delivering
today
is
earmarked
by
federal
power
commission
certificate
to
come
from
a
particular
source.
it
will
go
through
a
certificated
pipeline
that
will
be
delivered
to
a
particular
distributor
or
possibly
a
user,
and
its
use
will
frequently
have
been
marked
by
the
certificate
itself.
the
rivalry
therefore
comes
in
these
vast
projects
for
the
future,
things
like
the
rock
springs
project
where
there
was
real
rivalry
even
though
it
was
ultimately
disapproved.
the
rivalry
is
in
buying
or
acquiring
large
quantities
of
gas
in
the
producing
areas.
rivalry
in
selling
is
in
selling
long
term
arrangements
to
the
distribution
companies
or
possibly
to
the
users.
there's
rivalry
in
planning
alternate
transmission
lines,
it
--
but
it
bring
linking
different
sources
of
supply
with
different
markets.
the
long
range
impact
of
that
may
have
considerable
significance
to
the
purchaser.
nor
thus
a
competition
end
as
we
visualize
it
when
the
contract
is
signed
because
there
is
still
rivalry
in
submitting
the
proposals
to
the
regulatory
agencies.
indeed,
one
of
the
things
that
seems
to
us
in
--
of
critical
importance
in
applying
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
this
kind
of
industry
is
that
the
regulatory
agencies
should
have
a
number
of
alternatives
available
so
that
they
can
choose
between
project
a
and
project
b
or
project
a,
b,
c
and
d
and
should
not
be
limited
only
to
what
one
company
puts
forward.
and
it's
that
fillings
i
suggested
before
i
think
that
indicates
the
interest
to
the
state
of
california
in
this
case.
the
nature
of
competition
in
this
industry
has
--
carries
three
important
consequences.
in
the
first
place,
it
means
that
competition
is
likely
to
be
episodic.
as
the
market
builds
up
an
additional
increment
of
unfilled
demand
large
enough
to
warrant
the
expansion
of
pipeline
facilities
or
in
a
dynamic
market
like
this
usually
the
construction
of
new
facilities,
then
there
will
be
a
period
of
competition.
there
was
such
a
flurry
in
1955
and
1956.
today,
there
is
intense
rivalry
looking
to
the
increment
of
demand
which
will
have
to
be
satisfied
beginning
after
1968.
and
it's
saying
that
i
suggest
the
second
consequence
and
that
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
long
term
future,
not
with
tomorrow,
next
week,
even
next
year.
but
we're
dealing
with
20-year
contracts
to
be
executed
in
the
future.
we're
concerned
with
the
structure
of
the
market
in
the
1970s,
1980s,
and
beyond.
and
the
third
consequence
is
that
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
but
certainly
it
is
not
decisive
whether
a
pipeline
company
is
currently
selling
gas
or
has
an
existing
pipeline
into
the
market.
as
i
say
that,
we
submit,
is
clearly
not
decisive
and
i
can
best
illustrate
this
by
referring
to
the
situation
that
has
developed
since
the
merger
in
the
southwest.
today,
there
is
intense
rivalry
between
el
paso,
transwestern,
and
gulf
pacific.
the
el
paso
and
the
two
new
companies
i
mentioned
earlier,
for
the
increment
of
demand
expected
after
1968.
transwestern
is
the
only
one
who
has
any
substantial
unused
capacity
in
its
pipeline.
gulf
pacific
would
build
a
new
line.
el
paso
would
have
to
build
a
new
line
or
greatly
add
to
it's
--
the
capacity
of
its
existing
facility
but
yet
there's
no
question
but
that
those
three
concerns
are
now
competing
for
that
next
increment
of
gas.
i
don't
want
to
exaggerate
this
point.
obviously
algonquin
that
carries
gas
into
boston
is
not
a
competitive
factor
in
the
california
market.
the
location
of
the
company,
its
resources,
its
access
to
supply,
its
relation
to
the
market
are
all
do
--
all
are
important
in
determining
whether
it's
a
competitive
factor.
the
only
point
i'm
seeking
to
emphasize
is
that
the
fact
there
is
no
bridge
from
pacific's
line
to
california
and
that
pacific
has
never
actually
delivered
any
gas
in
california,
does
not
show
that
it
is
not
a
competitive
factor.
now
against
that
background,
i
come
to
the
critical
question,
was
pacific
such
an
independent
competitive
factor
for
future
projects
to
the
california
market
that
its
acquisition
by
el
paso
may
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition?
here,
we're
concerned,
i
think,
primarily
with
the
structure
of
the
market
as
the
court
emphasized
in
brown
shoe
and
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case.
the
legislative
history
shows
beyond
the
doubt
of
what
congress
was
concerned
within
section
7
was
barring
chip
--
was
to
nip
in
the
bud
monopoly
and
other
restraints
of
competition
by
barring
those
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
market
that
generally
result
in
a
lessening
of
competition.
taking
this
case
then
in
its
simplest
terms
what
it
seems
to
come
down
to
is
this.
the
largest
pipeline
company
in
the
country,
the
only
actual
supplier
of
gas
to
california
has
acquired
the
only
other
company
which
was
a
pipeline
in
being
west
of
the
rockies
and
which
was
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
seeking
to
enter
the
california
market.
pacific
was
a
going
enterprise.
it
was
interested
in
the
market.
it
tapped
areas
of
production
which
would
be
increasingly
important
to
california
on
the
face
of
it.
swallowing
up
by
el
paso,
one
of
its
few
natural
rivals
would
seem
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
now,
while
those
seem
to
be
the
essential
elements,
our
case
of
course
goes
far
beyond
that.
first,
the
undisputed
evidence
shows,
we
think,
that
just
prior
to
the
merger,
pacific
was
engaged
in
active
competition
with
el
paso.
and
remember
that
pacific's
life
was
short
so
that
even
one
instance
of
rivalry
in
this
business
would
be
very
important.
let
me
describe
it
in
a
little
detail.
in
1955
and
1956,
one
of
the
major
new
increments
of
demand
in
southern
california
was
the
need
of
southern
california
edison
for
a
permanent
supply
of
natural
gas
with
which
to
fire
its
steam
boilers
for
generating
electricity
in
place
of
oil
which
was
under
much
criticism
as
a
matter
of
smog
control.
up
to
that
point,
edison
had
secured
an
interruptible
supply
from
the
southern
company.
interruptible
because
whenever
the
southern
companies
needed
the
gas
to
--
for
domestic
users
or
others,
they'd
take
it
away
from
edison
and
edison
would
have
to
convert
it
over
to
firing
its
boilers
with
oil.
the
southern
companies
had
been
unwilling
to
commit
a
--
to
make
a
commitment
for
furnishing
edison
a
steady
supply
for
a
long
term
for
a
block
of
gas.
in
january
1956,
edison
which
apparently
felt
this
problem
increasingly
keenly
went
to
edi
--
went
to
el
paso
and
as
to
el
paso,
to
make
a
direct
sale
of
gas
to
it.
and
el
paso
refused
to
make
the
direct
sale
saying
that,
"you
are
a
customer
of
our
customer,
the
southern
companies
and
therefore,
we
won't
deal
with
you,
go
and
speak
to
them."
in
may
therefore,
edison
turn
to
pacific
northwest
and
they
began
to
talk
about
a
plan
for
bringing
in
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
daily.
in
june,
that's
only
a
month
later,
either
because
they
were
cause
in
effect
or
by
coincidence,
and
i
cannot
say
which,
the
southern
companies
suddenly
did
offer
a
firm
supply
of
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
to
edison.
but
that
offer
have
to
be
withdrawn
because
southern
found
that
the
gas
wasn't
available
at
the
time
edison
began
to
press
the
negotiation.
by
july
30,
edison
and
pacific
northwest
had
entered
into
a
tentative
agreement
under
which
edison
--
under
which
pacific
would
bring
in
from
canada
300
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
daily
which
edison
would
take
100
and
up
to
150
million
cubic
feet
a
days
--
of
gas
daily.
now
this
agreement
was
--
was
tentative,
necessarily
so
because
you
have
to
have
some
market
for
the
whole
300
million
in
order
to
make
it
a
financial
--
financially
feasible
to
build
the
pipelines.
but
edison
and
pacific
were
pushing
ahead
with
their
plan.
pacific
was
to
deal
with
getting
the
supply
and
edison
was
to
approach
the
local
distribution
companies
with
a
view
to
getting
them
to
agree
to
take
some
of
it.
pg&e
brushed
it
off
very
quickly
but
the
southern
companies
expressed
interest
and
asked
for
further
details.
on
august
24,
let's
just
say
it
was
about
three
weeks
after
the
tentative
agreement
was
signed,
kayser,
the
president
of
el
paso,
went
to
call
on
quentin
who
is
the
officer
of
edison
handling
this
promotion
or
deal
or
the
transaction,
if
you
will.
kayser
told
quentin
that
he
wanted
to
hold
the
market
there
in
southern
california.
in
fact,
in
a
memorandum,
quentin
said
that
kayser
had
said
he
was
prepared
to
fight
for
the
last
--
to
the
last
ditch.
but
quentin
testified
that
kayser
said,
he
wanted
to
hold
the
market
there
in
southern
california
and
was
prepared
to
supply
it
and
that
he
would
resist
the
efforts
of
anybody
else,
and
he
was
referring
to
pacific
to
come
in
there.
and
then
kayser
made
an
oral
offer
of
a
direct
sale
of
150
million
cubic
feet
from
el
paso
to
edison
with
the
southern
companies
to
get
a
fee
for
transporting.
and
my
friend
says
in
his
brief
that
that
statement
is
contrary
to
the
record.
but
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
the
letter
which
mr.
keyser
thereafter
wrote
to
quentin,
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it
now
but
we
refer
to
it
in
our
brief
that
he
describes
how
he
had
formerly
refused
to
make
a
direct
sale,
how
the
southern
companies
have
changed
their
policy
and
how
he
was
now
offering
a
direct
sale.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
clear
that
he
was
aware
of
the
competition
and
by
inference
that
the
rivalry
brought
about
a
change
in
southern
companies'
conduct
and
el
paso's
conduct.
now
in
the
end,
this
proposal
failed
through
because
the
southern
companies
decided
that
they
could
bring
in
gas
more
economically
through
what
they
called
their
existing
pattern
of
supply,
in
other
words,
through
el
paso.
but
i
submit
that
the
failure
cannot
obscure
either
the
fact
of
competition
at
that
time
or
the
likelihood
that
an
independent
pacific
would
resume
or
continue
this
kind
of
effort.
indeed,
if
one
thinks
suppose
the
acquisition
had
come
on
august
26
while
the
dickering
was
still
going
forward
before
the
southern
companies
had
said
no,
would
seem
to
me
no
one
would
say
that
substantial
competition,
the
chance
of
substantial
competition
haven't
been
less.
well,
in
terms
of
this
market
in
the
long
term
future,
the
dif
--
the
difference
between
an
acquisition
in
october
and
an
acquisition
in
august
surely
is
immaterial.
in
addition,
we
submit
that
the
undisputed
facts
show
a
probability
that
edison's
competitive
activity
wouldve
continued
and
that
we're
not
left
simply
to
draw
an
inference
from
the
instance
that
i
have
described.
i've
already
mentioned
california
is
insatiable
market,
growing
at
the
rate
of
200
million
cubic
feet
a
day.
it's
quite
apparent
that
the
canadian
and
rocky
mountain
supplies
would
in
the
long
term
future
become
more
and
more
impartment
to
california
as
the
gas
--
texas
gas
and
the
permian
basin
gas
was
either
used
or
committed
to
other
areas.
it
seems
inevitable
that
pacific
would
have
continued
its
effort
to
link
them.
there,
it
was
hooked
to
both
those
fields
very
favorably
located
with
only
the
need
of
a
bridge
in
the
california
and
with
pacific
under
the
pressure
of
finding
new
markets
because
it's
very
badly
needed
new
markets.
the
opportunity,
i
think,
is
further
approved
by
the
fact
that
four
major
projects,
while
never
completed,
were
seriously
talked
about
in
this
short
five-year
period.
there
was
the
agree
--
there
was
a
series
of
agreements
that
i
mentioned
earlier
in
1954
and
1955
involving
westcoast
transmission.
there
was
the
agreement
with
edison
that
i
just
finished
talking
about.
el
paso
after
it
acquired
pacific
northwest
had
two
projects
that
involved
bringing
down
some
canadian
gas
that
in
one
instance
mixing
it
with
very
substantial
quantities
of
other
gas
and
so
taking
it
to
the
california
market.
one
of
those
--
one
of
run
for
twin
falls,
idaho
down
to
las
vegas,
the
other
was
the
rock
springs
project
that
we
mentioned
earlier.
so
there
are
four
things
that
people
seriously
considered
investing
time
and
money
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
they
show
that
the
likelihood
of
this
kind
of
promotional
activity
was
a
reality.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
el
paso
wanted
gas
to
serve
its
own
market
unquestionably.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
instead
of
the
gas
coming
from
el
paso
and
el
paso
deciding
where
to
bring
it
from
that
there
would
have
been
an
independent
presence
also
seeking
to
fill
that
market.
and
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
is
based
upon
something
between
conjectures
and
probabilities.
it
--
it's
certainly
is
not
--
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
in
fairness
that
any
of
these
things
wouldve
happened
and
indeed
the
district
court
found
that
they
wouldn't.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
what
i
do
say,
mr.
justice,
essentially
is
that
it
is
improper
in
applying
section
7
to
speculate
about
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
competition.
if
two
horses
are
matched
in
a
steeplechase
and
one
of
them
is
scratched,
you
don't
say,
"oh,
there
would
have
been
no
competition
because
i
find
that
the
remaining
horse
would
have
won
the
race
anyway."
and
that
i
think
is
essentially
our
proposition
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
never
--
i
think
the
court
had
never
found
that
pacific
would
not
have
tried
to
promote
projects
to
california.
it
did
find
of
course
that
it
would
not
have
succeeded.
it
finds
if
i
might
address
myself
to
the
findings
in
a
little
more
detail.
and
i
think
it's
easiest
to
work
back
through
them
on
page
66
in
findings
of
100
to
103,
of
course
the
court
recites
the
ultimate
conclusions
that
pacific
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
pacific
had
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prevailing
and
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
providing
any
substantial
competition.
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
next
three
findings
saying
the
same
thing.
now,
those
we
think
are
simply
legal
conclusions
that
the
real
meaning
of
that
finding
is
to
be
found
in
the
preceding
of
half
dozen
findings
beginning
with
finding
94
and
running
through
99.
in
94th,
take
it
as
an
example,
the
court
--
the
court
found
that
financial
condition
of
pacific
northwest
through
a
such
that
it
is
improbable
that
it
could
have
succeeded
in
selling
natural
gas
at
that
time
in
the
california
market.
but
there's
a
prediction
of
what
would've
happened
in
the
horse
race,
not
a
prediction
of
whether
pacific
would've
run
a
good
race.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
don't
think
i'm
--
i'm
not
making
any
prediction.
i'm
arguing
that
we
should
not
engage
in
making
this
prediction.
that
the
basic
theory
of
the
antitrust
law
is
that
who
gets
the
deal,
who
is
successful,
who
wins
the
race
is
to
be
determined
through
the
competitive
process.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
very
--
a
very
important
and
sound
principle,
the
implicit
in
all
our
antitrust
policy
for
at
least
two
reasons.
the
first
one
is
that
this
is
not
something
that
lends
itself
to
a
judicial
inquiry
as
to
which
company
will
be
the
more
successful.
you
could
take
evidence
on
it
back
and
forth
and
still
never
know
for
sure.
the
second
reason
and
perhaps
the
more
important
reason
is
that
the
presence
of
an
independent
rival,
even
if
the
rival
isn't
going
to
win,
sets
very
definite
limits
on
the
conduct
of
the
other
firm.

mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
hoping
you
would
say
(inaudible).
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
the
proper
interpretation
of
it.
if
it
is,
then
i
would
simply
--
then
i
would
have
to
say
that
we
attack
the
findings
and
--
and
say
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
undisputed
evidence.
but
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
findings.
take
94
for
an
example.
all
he
says
is
the
financial
condition
of
pacific
northwest
was
such
that
it
was
improbable
that
it
could
have
succeeded
in
selling
natural
gas
at
any
time
in
the
california
market.
that
surely
is
a
guess
as
to
whether
it
could
have
finished
the
race
and
not
anything
more.
and
take
--
take
over
on
page
66
as
another
illustration
finding
99.
there,
the
court
finds
there
is
no
evidence
to
pacific
northwest
that
it
remained
as
a
separate
and
independent
entity,
could
have
put
together
an
interstate
natural
gas
project
to
serve
california
acceptable
to
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
california
public
utilities
commission.
now,
clearly
the
function
of
the
court
in
dealing
with
a
business
like
this
is
not
to
predict
what
the
regulatory
agency
will
do
or
what
it
will
approve
or
won't
approve.
indeed,
the
importance
of
competition
here
is
that
there'd
be
alternatives
open
to
the
regulatory
agency
so
that
they
aren't
dependent
on
just
one
company.
i
think
i
can
illustrate
that
point
very
clearly
by
taking
the
situation
in
california
since
the
merger.
first,
we
had
el
paso
put
forward
the
rock
springs
project
and
pressed
it
very
hard
for
a
number
of
years,
i
guess,
it
came
close
to
getting
approval.
the
other
companies,
transwestern
and
the
gulf
pacific
interest
were
opposing
rock
springs,
because
it
rivaled
them.
now,
there's
to
be
a
comparative
proceeding
between
el
paso,
a
somewhat
different
project,
gulf
pacific,
and
transwestern.
only
one
of
those
will
succeed,
but
surely
one
couldn't
find
at
this
stage
that
el
paso
will
not
succeed
in
getting
the
approval
of
the
federal
power
commission
therefore,
it
isn't
substantial
competitive
factor
in
the
future
market
in
california.
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
now,
if
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
no,
it's
not,
it's
not
proof
of
that
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
pacific
can't
put
forward
a
variety
of
project
in
the
past
that
it
had
been
trying
to
do
it.
we
know
in
addition
that
that
line
there
runs
off
pacific,
that
it
involved
using
some
canadian
gas
although,
it
couldn't
have
taken
the
same
form,
el
paso
had
some
other
gas
in
on
it.
furthermore,
we
know
mr.
justice,
that
pacific
both
is
in
a
inherent
position
where
it
was
under
a
necessity
of
seeking
this
market
and
where
it's
forming
this
bridge,
it
almost
seems
inevitable
in
the
logic
of
the
situation
that
some
independent
company,
that
pacific
if
it
had
fell
independent
remained
independent.
one
had
continued
to
try
the
link
the
important
new
canadian
reserves
and
the
important
rocky
mountain
gas
field
with
this
enormous
california
market.
now,
we
know
that
what
it
did
in
the
past
was
something
to
be
taken
seriously.
pacific
was
pushing
ahead
vigorously
all
through
its
existence.
we
know
that
edison
took
it
seriously
enough
so
that
when
mr.
kayser
first
went
to
it
and
said
he
knew
of
the
competition
and
he
wanted
to
make
a
sale.
pacific
said
it
was
not
in
a
position
to
entertain
any
other
offers.
so
it
must
have
thought
that
this
at
least
was
something
that
might
go
through.
we
note
the
southern
companies
as
preferred
the
figures.
we
know
that
el
paso
took
it
pretty
seriously.
its
ball
went
to
pacific
--
went
to
edison
and
spoke
of
its
intent
to
fight
to
the
last
ditch.
the
first
offer
of
a
direct
sale
was
made
by
el
paso,
which
it
had
never
done
before.
the
terms
of
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
suggests
that
pacific
can
hardly
have
been
thought
of
as
having
no
potential,
no
value.
el
--
had
the
market
value
of
the
stock
that
el
paso
surrendered
was
four
times,
the
book
value
of
the
pacific
stock.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
says
there
is
no
--
it
says
in
substance,
there's
no
evidence
that
the
buyers
would
have
agreed
to
buy
from
pacific,
but
i
don't
think
that
we're
called
upon
to
prove
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
skipped.
well
certainly,
the
--
there
was
a
failure
to
develop
some
of
the
canadian
supplies
that
pacific
had
hoped
to
use.
they
didn't
come
in
to
be
anything
like
what
had
been
anticipated.
but
if
that
is
meant
to
be
a
prediction
that
because
that
supply
failed,
pacific
never
could
be
a
substantial
factor
in
this
market
then
i
guess
i
would
--
i
don't
think
it
is
meant
to
be
that,
but
if
it
is,
then
i
would
have
to
say
that
it's
plainly
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
there's
a
great
deal
of
other
gas
in
canada.
it
was
out
of
gas
in
the
rocky
mountain
areas.
well,
pacific
had
at
least
the
opportunity
to
get
some
of
it.
i
think
the
real
point
here
is
that
unless
one
has
something
like
a
failing
company
that
to
take
a
competitive
situation
like
this,
to
take
the
largest
company,
the
one
which
has
been
dominant
in
the
market,
the
only
supplier,
and
to
allow
it
to
snuff-out
the
serious
promotional
enterprise
of
another
company
which
has
advantages
and
disadvantages,
where
they
balance
out,
one
can't
say.
but
which
is
certainly
a
going
concern
and
which
is
certainly
in
there
pushing
ahead
to
get
some
of
the
market
is
the
antithesis
especially
in
dealing
with
a
source
of
energy
of
what
the
clayton
act
was
intended
to
accomplish.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
i
--
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
then
because
i
misspoke
myself
if
that's
what
i
have
said.
in
the
certain
--
first
place,
i
would
most
emphatically
deny
that
pacific
was
not
in
the
market
for
selling
gas
--
projects
of
gas
to
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
this
--
but
this
is
what
people
are
engaged
in
selling.
they're
not
--
it's
not
the
gas
laid
down
through
the
pipeline
being
delivered
today.
it's
the
--
they
are
engaged
in
rival
promotions,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
one
doesn't
have
in
the
case
of
sales
of
shoes
or
of
steel
that
the
product
being
sold
now
isn't
earmarked
for
the
next
x
years
and
the
rivalry
comes
in
seeking
to
sell
a
future
increment.
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
if
their
merging
negotiations
is
to
fill
a
demand,
say
in
the
third
part
of
the
company
--
country
which
is
not
now
filled
in
which
they
might
enter
as
independent
competitors.
i
shall
be
here
arguing
not
in
the
case
of
steel
companies,
but
in
the
case
of
other
companies
in
april
that
that
is
clearly
a
violation
of
section
7.
and
i
don't
mean
by
saying
that
i
disagree
with
your
honor's
statement
earlier
to
say
that
i
accept
the
view
that
that
is
--
in
accordance
with
section
7.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
stress
is
that
a
company
which
was
admirably
situated
when
you
look
at
the
logic
of
--
look
at
the
logic
of
the
situation
which
had
its
difficulties
but
which
was
going
concern
which
nobody
suggest
to
a
failing
company,
which
was
selling
the
thing
these
people
have
to
sell
in
the
market
at
which
was
offered
a
rivalry
in
a
market
which
is
exceedingly
thin
at
best.
that
taking
those
circumstances
into
account
and
the
fact
that
it
had
competed
that
this
does
tend
to
substantially
left
the
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
--
well,
what
i
think
of
the
reason
i
said
what
i
did
was
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
judge
as
i've
suggested
undertook
to
find
whether
pacific
would
have
succeeded
and
that
is
what
i
mean
is
the
wrong
standard.
now,
if
you
read
the
findings
the
way
it
seems
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
right
question.
i
think
that's
an
utterly
irrelevant
question.
i
think
that
if
el
paso
--
if
pacific
was
in
the
market
seeking
to
sell
that
it
could
and
then
exert
pressure
on
el
paso.
and
even
if
el
paso
was
the
one
that
came
out
ahead
before
the
federal
power
commission
every
time,
still
pacific
northwest
would
be
at
least
for
a
number
of
years,
an
important
competitive
factor.
that's
why
i
think
it
was
the
wrong
question.
now,
if
you
read
the
findings
as
meaning
that
pacific
was
such
applied
by
night
that
it
couldn't
exert
any
pressure
--
couldn't
ever
exert
any
pressure
on
el
paso
at
all
which
i
think
is
wrong.
but
if
you
read
them
that
way,
then
i
do
say
that
they
are
unsupported
by
the
--
the
conclusion
that's
contrary
to
what
the
evidence
requires.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
first
to
address
myself
to
the
changes
in
the
competitive
picture,
the
structure
of
the
market
that
have
developed
since
the
merger,
which
i
had
no
time
to
speak
to
yesterday.
and
then
second,
i
will
try
to
explain
more
clearly
than
perhaps
i
did
yesterday,
what
we
think
the
question
of
the
legal
standing
here
is.
and
i'll
take
them
up
in
that
order.
el
paso
argues,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
changes
since
the
merger
show
that
the
merger
or
acquisition,
more
accurately,
will
not
substantially
lessen
competition.
first,
because
pg
&
e
has
build
a
very
large
pipeline
to
carry
--
to
california
to
canada.
and
second,
because
of
developments
in
the
southwest.
now,
it's
quite
true
that
in
the
near
future,
for
10
years,
perhaps
15
years,
the
pg
&
e
pipeline,
the
pacific
gas
transmission
will
satisfy
all
the
demands
of
that
company.
and
that
for
the
immediate
future,
changes
the
picture
indisputably,
i
can't
argue
otherwise.
the
fact
remains
however
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
very
long
range
problems.
we
are
dealing
with
the
economic
future
in
the
sense
of
this
whole
area.
and
el
paso's
current
contract
to
supply
pg
&
e
will
run
out.
we
think
this
still,
the
pacific,
as
an
independent
company,
would
still
offer
and
might
offer
an
alternative.
down
the
southwest,
the
argument
is
that
the
development
of
transwestern
which
has
a
pipeline
and
the
effort
of
gulf
pacific
to
get
in,
which
are
the
most
real
things,
supplies
sufficient
competition.
it
seems
to
us
assuming
that
the
events
after
the
merger
are
relevant
that
there
are
three
comments
that
should
be
made
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
pg
and
--
edison's
acquisition
of
its
own
source?
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
that
hasn't
been
approved
yet.
that's
one
of
the
rivals
here
that
i
referred
to
as
the
gulf
pacific,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not.
no,
no,
couldn't
have?
if
it
--
it
--
the
--
i'm
not.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
that
as
my
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
expression
perhaps
shows
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
but
i
don't
think
it
preceded
the
merit.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
in
--
in
essence,
there's
a
comparative
proceeding
before
the
--
the
fpc
at
the
present
time
to
serve
this
expected
increment
of
demand.
transwestern
has
supplied
gulf
pacific
which
it
will
bring
in
this
king
ranch
gas
that
you
just
spoke
of,
the
humble
gas
and
el
paso,
they
are
rivals.
one
may
win,
or
perhaps
two
will
get
certificates.
one
can't
tell.
our
position
essentially
is
that
if
pacific
were
an
independent
company,
it
would
be
there
as
a
fourth
or
might
be
there
as
a
fourth
concern.
and
that
it
would
be
offering
a
quite
different
alternative.
these
all
relate
to
gas
coming
from
the
southwest
from
the
older
region.
pacific's
alternative
in
all
probability
would
be
one
of
this
to
bring
gas
from
canada
or
possibly
some
from
the
rocky
mountain
sources.
now,
of
course,
el
paso
is
in
a
position
to
offer
that.
but
if
el
paso
offers
it,
it's
a
decision
made
by
a
company
which
has
very
heavy
commitments
in
the
southwest.
if
it
was
specific
as
an
independent
and
if
we're
able
to
put
one
together,
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
opportunity.
and
the
pressure
of
this
competing
rivals
even
though
only
of
them
get
it
before
the
federal
power
commission,
we
think
is
very
important.
i
would
also
point
out
that
three
company
--
one
company
--
two
companies
with
pipelines
to
a
market
like
los
angeles
and
another
company
trying
to
get
in
is
very
thin
rivalry
indeed
compared
to
what
exist
elsewhere
in
the
country.
in
new
york
city,
there
are
four
interstate
pipelines
carrying
gas
to
that
area.
in
detroit,
much
smaller,
four.
in
pittsburgh,
there
are
seven.
in
chicago,
there
are
four.
and
the
chicago
interstate
market
is
much
smaller
than
the
los
angeles
interstate
market.
in
saint
louis,
there
are
four
there,
and
three
trying
to
get
in.
so
that
the
amount
of
competition
that
exists
even
since
the
merger
is,
we
think,
is
simply
not
enough
but
it's
small
in
comparison
with
others.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
longer
one
projects
into
the
future
and
i
do
submit
that
we're
concerned
with
the
long
range
future,
not
1968,
that's
almost
nothing
in
terms
of
this
merger.
it's
the
1970s,
1980s,
and
beyond
that
we're
concerned
with,
that
the
longer
the
perspective,
the
more
important
this
rocky
mountain
gas
and
the
canadian
gas
and
pacific's
opportunities
would
come.
now,
i
turn
to
the
other
question.
and
i
think
the
two
ways
of
putting
it,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
our
position
here,
essentially,
is
this.
that
one
should
--
that
the
clayton
act,
section
7
and
the
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
require
one
to
focus
on
the
number
of
companies
seeking
to
serve
the
--
a
market,
their
size,
their
number,
their
comparative
size
and
things
to
that
kind.
and
that
if
we
show
that
pacific
is
a
going
concern,
interested
in
the
market,
one
that
is
tried
to
sell
in
the
market
has
offered
some
rivalry
and
that
there
are
not
other
companies
so
that
the
withdrawal
of
this
one
has
no
effect
on
that
of
competitive
picture,
then
we
have
proved
our
case.
now,
there
are
--
there
are
two
dangers
on
either
side.
of
course,
if
we
all
we
show
is
that
pacific
is
a
pipeline
company,
there
are,
as
mr.
harrison
said,
great
many
pipeline
companies
that
wouldn't
do.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
have
to
show,
if
we
have
to
prove
that
pacific
would
get
some
of
this
contract,
which
is
what
i
think
the
district
court
erroneously
inquired
into,
if
we
have
to
speculate
as
to
what
would
happen
in
the
future
and
offer
all
kinds
of
factors
to
--
how
successful
pacific
would
be,
then
i
suppose,
we
have
failed
to
prove
our
case.
but
we
think
essentially
when
we've
shown
a
--
a
going
concern,
a
company
that
has
offered
some
rivalry,
a
company
that
has
an
interest
in
the
market,
not
only
because
of
the
logic
of
its
situation
but
one
expressed
on
several
occasions
in
the
past,
then
that
is
all
that
the
statute
required
us
to
prove.
and
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
estimating
the
probabilities
as
to
what
would
happen
if
the
structure
of
the
market
had
not
been
impaired.
and
we
say
that
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
since
the
sportswriter
is
known
very
well
this
morning,
it's
very
difficult
to
predict
the
future
and
it's
even
more
difficult
to
predict
the
business
future.
and
the
second
one
is
that
the
presence
of
this
--
of
a
rival,
or
one
seeking
to
be
a
rival,
who
at
least
had
something
to
offer,
was
a
going
concern,
it
was
fighting
to
overcome
its
difficulties,
does
affect
the
conduct
of
the
other
firms
in
the
market.
and
that's
why
we
think
it's
that
--
those
elemental
facts
of
the
structure
that
are
decisive.
