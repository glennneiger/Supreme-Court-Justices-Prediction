justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
find
that
(inaudible)
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
the
apportionment
accord
to
the
provisions
of
new
york
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you're
claiming
that
the
constitution
agrees
with
itself
that
that
would
be
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
section?
what
portion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
where
do
you
assume
that
that
referendum
had
no
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
what
you're
going
to
say
now,
i
take
it.
that
all
terms
of
the
proposition
of
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
a
state
to
apportion
or
approach
apportionment
in
that
way
of
approach
apportionment
from
a
population
basis,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
before
you
can
measure
anything
though,
the
exact
measure
becomes
outstanding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
would
agree
with
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
think
before
you
get
into
the
question
of
the
apportionment,
you
are
to
address
yourself
as
to
what
the
constitutional
standard
is,
if
any
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
federal
constitutional
standard.
you
have
got
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
order
to
make
your
argument
based
on
statistical
figures,
what
you
thought
malapportionment
meaningful
to
the
standpoint
of
this
court,
you
have
got
to
address
yourself
to
the
question
of
what
the
federal
constitutional
standard
is
against
which
the
apportionment
is
actually
judged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
this
is
a
question
of
the
distribution
of
power
on
the
question
of
--
of
restriction,
not
individual
voting
power.
this
is
a
question
of
the
distribution
of
power,
governmental
power
in
the
state.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand,
but
my
--
my
question
(inaudible)
what
is
there
in
the
federal
constitution
that
says
that
a
state
cannot
apportion
its
senate
in
the
same
way
if
it
chooses
to
that
the
united
states
apportionment
senators
are
on
the
various
states.
now,
i
don't
--
don't
recognize
the
arguments
that
are
made
as
to
the
federal
analogy,
not
being
an
analogy,
but
what
is
there
in
the
federal
constitution
that
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
specifically,
that
says
that
a
state
cannot
allow
senators
on
the
basis
of
geographic
community
who
distinguish
population?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
worried
--
tell
me
where
it
is
that
you
find
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
agree
that
baker
and
carr
furnishes
no
guidance,
no
light
whatever
to
the
question
that
you're
debating
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
in
new
york
said
that
we
think
(inaudible)
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
(inaudible)
or
both,
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
putting
the
question
to
you,
supposing
the
state
of
new
york
had
said
explicitly,
"we'll
have
one
--
we'll
have
one
member
of
the
senate,
allot
to
the
so-called
business
centers
in
the
state
and
another
member
allotted
to
the
so-called
labor
industries.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
--
by
hypothesis
i
am
assuming
that
neither
of
those
--
neither
of
those
forms
would
have
taken
into
account
the
population
figure
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
might
agree
with
what
you
pose
in
the
new
york
legislature
but
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
would
come
back
to
that
that
prevents
that
kind
of
a
debate
going
on
in
new
york
legislature?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
theory
is
that
that
kind
of
a
debate
would
be
beside
the
point
because
anything
other
than
the
side
of
the
debate
that
you're
arguing
before
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
crazy
quilt
theory
presupposes
the
basic
population
standard
defined
as
you
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
it
was
impressible
even
the
(inaudible)
urban
--
urban-rural.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
--
it
--
it
--
that's
impermissible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
there's
also
another
question
to
address
yourself
to
is
to
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
anything
to
do
whatever
with
apportionment,
as
distinguished
from
the
racial
discrimination
cases
of
exercising
civil
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
argument
and
your
brief,
as
i
read
it,
all
proceed
in
the
premise
that
the
measure,
the
constitutional
standard
against
which
these
conflicting
views
have
got
be
judged,
are
from
the
equal
protection
clause
that
working
from
that.
do
you
accept
that
proposition,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
of
course
there
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
room
for
baker
to
operate
even
though
you
rejected
that
proposition.
you
recognize
that,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
say,
you
didn't
--
you
recognize
that
there
is
room
for
baker
to
operate
without
your
--
without
accepting
that
proposition
if
one
rejects
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
that's
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
whether
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
field
of
apportionment,
the
abstract
notion
of
equal
protection
as
embodied
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
apportionment
as
distinguished
--
as
the
distribution
of
governmental
power
within
the
state
as
distinguished
from
its
obvious
application
in
relation
to
racial
discrimination
as
it
bears
upon
individual
voting
rights.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
alright.
i
just
want
to
get
the
premises
of
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
read
the
debates
of
the
constitutional
convention
in
new
york
of
1894?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
quite
a
group
of
distinguished
lawyers
who
were
delegates
of
that
convention,
are
they
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
roehr
is
one
of
them
i
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
others.
do
you
find
anything
in
those
debates
that
indicated
that
any
of
those
men
entertained
any
doubts
that
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
was
concerned,
they
were
free
to
device
an
apportionment
plan
that
they
thought
best
needed
--
would
be
needed
in
the
new
york
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
liable
debate,
wasn't
there
as
to
different
measures?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
of
course
of
those
debates
which
were
in
the
subject
to
differences
of
view
and
having
to
notice
these
problems
can
be
presented
--
they're
subject
of
differences
of
view,
was
it
--
did
anybody
suggest
that
a
proposal
that
somebody
put
forward
that
he
disagree
with
was
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
system
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
political
pole
is
democratic
in
the
public
parties
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
propriety,
which
is
important?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
live
in
new
york?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
define
them
in
the
constitution
and
to
that
effect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
population
exactly
have
to
do
although
they've
not
in
particular
to
do
with
it,
where
is
the
lack
of
equal
protection,
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
that
that
situation
hereby
everybody
has
agreed
with.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
said
that
population
(inaudible)
didn't
have
really
anything
to
do
with
it
as
controlling,
they
could
do
it
as
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact,
you
take
population
out,
you
still
--
what
--
what's
left
to
the
equal
protection
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
1957
election
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
was
there
an
apportionment
question
on
the
ballot
itself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
governor
harriman's
recommendation
that
you
referred
to,
that
did
not
appear
as
separate
question
on
the
ballot?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
accept
the
propagation
that
equality
of
individual
political
rights
is
the
same
thing
as
equality
of
representation
in
a
state
legislature?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
cast
your
ballot,
the
right
to
have
your
--
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
ballot,
yeah
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
you
don't
do
that
in
the
senate.
the
senate
has
deliberately
refused
to
recognize
that
principle
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
got
--
you
got
to
recognize
that
if
your
case
stands
or
fall
on
the
question
of
numbers,
the
arithmetic
of
this
problem,
you're
in
a
very
difficult
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
keep
on
arguing
numbers
all
the
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
keep
arguing
numbers
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
you
can't
get
away
from
it.
