(inaudible)
the
initial
statements
in
applying
the
equal
protection
clause,
if
there's
unequal
treatment,
you
normally
should
have
a
reason
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
difference
between
the
treatments
you
accord,
the
cities
with
6%
or
more
of
the
population
and
those
counties
with
less
and
what's
the
reason
for
that?
you
say
that
this
is
an
urban,
rural
thing
at
all,
if
the
parties
had
abandoned
this
whole
argument
and
you
say
--
it's
because
these
counties
are
so
heavily
urbanized,
but
you
do
distinguish
between
one
kind
of
urbanized
county
and
another,
namely,
the
ones
with
more
than
6%
and
the
one
with
less.
and
what's
your
--
what's
the
justification
for
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
discrimination,
which
you
admit
it
is
a
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
it
has
been
in
terms
of
--
of
access
to
the
legislature
or
anything
like
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
these
are
urbanized
counties.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
a
measurable
--
isn't
there
a
measurable
difference
between
the
representation
for
1000
people
say
in
nassau
than
--
as
compared
with
new
york
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
suffolk?
justice
byron
r.
white
suffolk.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
suffolk?
you
called
suffolk
as
one
of
the
urbanized
counties?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
a
--
it
has
a
measurable
difference
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
per
capita
representation
substitutes
compared
to
new
york
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what's
the
reason
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
district
--
districting
a
state
at
all,
even
if
where
districting
completely
on
the
population
basis,
has
the
effect
of
a
--
of
a
diffusion
of
political
power,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
assume,
you
just
--
assume
you
just
--
you
divide
a
state
into
districts,
just
the
very
act
of
doing
that
as
compared
to
as
having
an
election
that
were
announced
to
a
diffusion
of
political
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
isn't
that
so
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
view
the
same
results
in
your
legislature,
if
your
legislature
was
elected
at
large
or
you'd
have
the
--
you
may
have
a
rather
different
result
than
a
--
than
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
not
sure
why
--
what's
your
--
what's
your
justification
is
for
distinguishing
between
--
between
a
1000
people
in
new
york
county
compared
with
a
1000
people
in
suffolk
county.
i
have
no
idea
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
talk
about
--
let's
just
talk
about
--
assume
as
is
true
in
your
case,
a
county
with
--
in
a
--
an
urban
county
with
less
than
6%
of
the
population
has
more
representatives
per
thousand
and
some
county
with
more
than
6%.
now,
certainly,
that's
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
per
thousand.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
true,
that's
true
and
i
also
would
like
to
know
of
what's
your
justification
for
discriminating
between
these
two
kinds
of
cities
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
keeping
down
the
size
of
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
threat
of
the
concentration
of
power
in
the
--
in
the
areas
with
only
a
minority
of
the
population.
now
which
would
you
prefer,
the
tyranny
of
the
minority
or
the
tyranny
of
the
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there's
going
to
be
control
by
either
the
majority
or
the
minority,
now
which
would
you
prefer?
you
apparently
would
prefer
that
control
by
the
minority?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
--
like
in
suffolk
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
can
pick
anyone
and
several
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
galt,
would
you
contend
that
if
they
--
if
--
if
they
did
have
--
the
people
did
have
an
opportunity
to
vote,
to
have
a
choice
between
the
present
system
and
one
based
on
state
population
and
they
chose
the
present
system,
that
would
be
the
end
of
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all
--
in
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all
probability,
it
would
be
your
view
that
such
a
vote
would
--
should
end
the
court
inquiry
into
the
matter.
