justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
have
you
put
it
in
your
brief
anywhere
the
population
in
your
largest
county
as
compared
to
the
population
of
your
smallest
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
--
do
they
have
a
representative?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
deny
that
the
--
compared
to
population
has
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
fairly
straight
question,
what's
the
population
of
new
york
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
population
of
new
york
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
chamber
of
commerce
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
--
what's
the
population
of
the
rest
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
does
a
test
of
figures.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
decided
to
give
new
york
city
one
senator
and
one
representative
and
give
the
rest
of
the
state
a
hundred
each
--
a
hundred
for
the
rest
of
the
state,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
those
--
what
are
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
well-defined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
the
question
because
--
i
asked
you
the
question
because
i
gather
that
your
argument
is
in
line
with
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
many
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
in
trying
to
determine
whether
a
particular
situation
is
a
violation
of
it,
the
court
has
not
attempted
to
capture
a
formula
or
to
set
out
certain
precise
standards.
it
has
recognized
that
imprecise
standards
and
had
said
that
you
look
at
the
circumstances
to
determine
whether
it
does
in
fact
amount
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
in
that
respect,
the
court
has
treated
that
the
general
imprecise
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
quite
differently
to
those
places
where
the
constitution
has
its
self-prescribed
the
fixed
statute
such
as
not
only
county
rate
or
(inaudible).
i
gather
that
you
are
arguing
on
the
basis,
the
court
does
have
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
see
whether
or
not
in
effect
in
the
end
there
has
been
an
invidious
discrimination
against
individual
holders,
which
is
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
do
you
go
far
enough
to
say
some
that
would
to
reject
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
go
far
enough
to
say
some
that
would
also
reject
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
when
you
say
--
that
you're
saying
that
something
that
could
be
thought
out
that
would
support.
yes,
something
is
all
through,
how
would
you
say
it
that
the
--
would
you
say
that
it
was
not
support
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
reading
it
from
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
are
reading
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood,
i
had
simply
â€“
if
you
were
reading
it
from
the
brief,
i
want
to
see
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
bother
that.
