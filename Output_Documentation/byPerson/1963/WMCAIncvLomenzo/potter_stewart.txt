justice
potter
stewart
so
you
talk
about
one
house,
in
both
houses
as
though
there
is
something
constitutionally
inevitable
about
a
state
having
a
bicameral
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
one?
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
--
is
there
anything
--
any
reason
why
they
couldn't
have
a
tricameral
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that
any
state
--
that
every
state
couldn't
have
a
unicameral
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
--
any
reason
why
a
state
couldn't
--
need
to
have
any
legislature
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
some
--
somebody
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
make
the
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
could
be
--
could
a
state
have
a
legislative
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
then
that
it
would
be
completely
unconstitutional
for
any
legislative
power
to
exist
in
a
governor's
counsel
appointed
by
the
governor
and
not
elected
by
the
people?
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
inevitably
true
to
the
full
extent
of
--
in
the
full
sweep
of
what
you
say?
it
may
or
may
not
be
true
in
new
york
state,
i
don't
know.
i
have
the
impression
that
new
york
city
has
a
very
great
deal
of
home
rule
power
as
contrasted
to
other
areas
in
the
state.
i
do
know
that
--
i
think
i
know
at
least
that
in
many
states,
many
municipalities
have
a
great
deal
of
home
rule
powers
contrasted
to
the
unincorporated
areas
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
let's
--
let's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
assume
--
let's
assume
a
case,
and
i'm
--
i'm
sure
this
is
a
hypothetical
case
because
i
don't
know
of
any
state
where
this
exists,
but
let's
take
a
--
a
case
where
a
--
a
city
has
a
complete
home
rule
power
and
the
legislature
has
no
power
over
it.
well,
then
in
that
case,
it
would
obviously
be
wrong
to
have
the
city
have
any
representation
at
all
within
legislature,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
so
now
that
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
and
to
the
extent,
to
the
degree
that
a
large
urban
municipality
interstate
has
home
rule
power,
couldn't
it
be
argued
that
there
was
some
rationality
about
having
it
--
have
less
representation
in
a
state
legislature
which
might
have
complete
100%
power
over
the
other
areas
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
the
existence
of
such
a
power
in
the
people
might
be
irrelevant
to
the
substantive
question
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
system
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
but
it
might
be
quite
relevant,
might
it
not,
to
the
question
of
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
do
something
about
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
elsewhere
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
there's
any
court
of
equity
might
well
stay
its
hand
under
accepted
principles,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
62.
and
at
the
present,
57
senators
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
1960
census.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
57.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
very
unusual
about
that.
let's
say
you
had
a
simple
system
of
one
senator
from
each
county
which
some
states
have,
one
senator
from
each
county.
well,
then,
exactly
the
same
thing
would
happen
as
you
say
this
ironical
amazing,
surprising
things
happening
in
new
york.
the
larger
--
the
larger
counties
become,
there
--
the
more
so-called
"malapportionment"
there
would
be.
justice
potter
stewart
those
states
(voice
overlap)
less
populous
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
haven't
said
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
let
me
--
mr.
justice
harlan
has
asked
you
this
unsuccessfully
and
maybe
the
answer
is
--
nobody
can
successfully
answer,
but
where
does
this
rule
of
law
come
from
that
you've
just
enunciated?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
(inaudible)
are
--
are
you
assuming
majority
--
majority
rule
in
each
legislative
district
that
this
is
constitutionally
required
for
example?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
take
--
let's
take
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
let's
just
take
a
senatorial
district
in
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
and
let's
say
that
the
candidates
are
a
and
b
of
the
--
red
party
and
the
green
party.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
a
gets
55%
of
the
vote
and
b
gets
45%
of
the
vote.
so
the
green
party
all
--
those
thousands
and
thousands
of
green
voters
are
not
represented
by
mr.
a
in
the
state
legislature,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
--
what
now
–
(inaudible)
--
you
keep
talking
about
majority
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rule,
what
happens
to
this?
and
then
now,
let's
say
in
the
very
next
legislative
district,
the
other
party
wins,
the
green
party
wins
by
55%.
now,
those
45%
in
the
contiguous
districts
of
--
red
party
voters
are
not
represented
by
mr.
b
from
that
district
in
the
legislature,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
some
political
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
there
some
political
reality
in
having
--
is
there
some
political
and
subtle
reality
in
having
the
disenfranchised
a
voters
in
district
one
be
more
or
less
represented
by
the
a
voters
who
prevailed
in
district
two?
i'm
only
suggesting,
mr.
sand,
and
it's
simply
a
suggestion
that
the
problems
we
have
before
us
in
these
cases
this
week
are
somewhat
more
complicated
and
subtle
than
has
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
and
--
in
that
they
not
--
cannot
necessarily
be
solved
by
simple
eighth
grade
arithmetic.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
just
go
back
and
--
and
peruse
my
other
question.
well,
let's
say
a
state
required
that
–
let's
say
a
state
decided
to
put
in
some
variant
of
the
(inaudible)
system
of
proportional
representation,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
well,
cambridge,
massachusetts
have
that
such
as
--
such
a
variant.
now,
would
this
be
constitutional
or
--
or
would
it
violate
the
equal
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
it
decide
–
a
state
decided
to
experiment
with
something
like
the
list
system
which
was
used
under
the
weimar
republic
and
their
republican
trans
and
in
belgium
today,
would
this
be
--
would
--
would
this
involve
a
violation
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
wouldn't
they
--
wouldn't
the
45%
of
the
red
party
in
that
district
who
didn't
have
representative
in
the
legislature,
couldn't
pay
--
say
that
they're
unrepresented
entirely
in
that
legislature
under
your
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
there
were
quid
pro
quo
for
that?
let's
say
that
the
people
from
new
york
city,
met
with
the
people
from
the
representatives
of
the
people
from
and
fair
--
fairly
representatives
of
the
people
from
the
other
parts
of
the
state.
and
new
york
city
said,
"we
will
give
up
some
of
our
--
what
--
what
otherwise
be
our
representation,
full
representation
in
the
state
legislature,
if
you
will
give
us
a
considerable
amount
of
--
of
local
autonomous
self
government"
and
if
that
kind
of
a
bargain
was
struck
as
a
deliberate
thing,
would
that
--
would
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
i'm
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
same
thing,
the
citizens
and
the
voters
of
new
york
city,
who
said,
"if
you
--
if
you
will
give
us
autonomy
in
this
area
and
that
area
and
the
other
areas,
so
we're
completely
immune
from
any
action
of
the
legislature
whatsoever
in
this,
that
and
the
other
area
and
we
will
have
100%
self-government
over
that,
we
will
give
up
certain
representation
in
the
state
legislature,
which
has
full
power
over
the
rest
of
the
state."
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
truly
autonomous
but
not
completely
autonomous,
that's
my
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
truly
and
completely
autonomous
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
it
should
have
no
representation
of
the
state
legislature
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
any
more
than
new
jersey
citizens
should
have
any
representation
of
the
new
york
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
you're
--
we're
not
talking
about
counting
a
vote
equally.
within
each
one
of
these
districts,
there's
no
claim
that
anyone
of
these
people
has
not
had
his
vote
counted
at
the
ballot
box,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
quite
a
different
concept,
that's
gray
against
sanders
and
that's
entirely
a
different
concept.
justice
potter
stewart
representative
body.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right
and
it
depends
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
are
50
states,
are
there
not?
you're
arguing
the
case
in
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
asking
us,
i
suppose
to
enunciate
a
--
some
guidelines
or
boundaries
here
that
would
apply
it
in
each
of
the
50
states,
necessarily
if
--
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
each
of
the
50
states,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
see
and
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me
about
your
argument,
as
i
suggested
at
the
beginning
is
all
these
assumptions,
the
assumption
that
it
was
one
exception
every
state
has
a
bicameral
legislature
or
does
in
fact
now,
but
there's
no
reason
to
unearth
that
it
--
i
can't
imagine
why
a
state
couldn't
have
a
tricameral
or
an
--
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
argument
is
talking
--
i'm
talking
about
one
house
but
you
talk
about
the
--
basically
about
both
houses
but
let's
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
state
had
a
dozen
houses
in
its
legislature,
would
it
--
would
six
be
enough
to
represent
population
or
would
11
have
to
or
would
only
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
state
had
only
two
counties
in
the
whole
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you're
asking
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
a
total
of
two?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
though.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
applicable
to
49
other
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case,
i
don't
understand
it.
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
numbers
of
voters
or
numbers
of
people.
justice
potter
stewart
because
you're
--
the
(inaudible)
the
preceding
counsel
talked
only
about
population,
i
(inaudible)
voters.
justice
potter
stewart
not
--
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
children?
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
either
one
would
be
rational?
justice
potter
stewart
citizen
population
or
registered
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you
when
you
talk
about
apportioned
per
capita.
are
you
talking
about
total
citizen
population
or
are
you
talking
about
total
eligible
voters
or
are
you
talking
about
total
registered
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
or
you're
about
--
are
you
talking
about
any
(inaudible)
principally?
justice
potter
stewart
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
--
let's
say,
the
state
of
new
york
that,
historically,
over
the
years,
up
in
st.
lawrence
county,
it's
cold,
snowy
in
november
and
--
and
just
historically,
you
can
show
that
only
10%
of
the
eligible
voters
have
voted
up
there
ever.
and
in
buffalo
county,
let's
say,
you
can
show
that
60%
of
the
eligible
voters
have
always
voted
there
within
a
percentage
point
or
two,
could
new
york
say,
"we're
going
to
measure
our
legislative
districts
by
registered
voters
or
those
who
voted
the
last
election
and
give
six
times
as
much
per
capita
representation
at
buffalo
county
as
they
do
to
st.
lawrence
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
true
about
st.
lawrence
country
and
buffalo
county,
i
just
invented
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that'll
reverse
my
case,
could
--
could
they
give
six
times
the
per
capita
representation
to
st.
lawrence
as
they
do
to
buffalo
county?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
kind
of
socially
desirable
to
encourage
people
to
vote
and
the
more
voters
you
got,
the
more
representation
you
get?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suggest
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
six
times
the
per
capita
representation
in
one
districts
that
that
you
do
on
the
other,
it's
inconsistent
with
what
you're
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
you
better
change
per
capita
to
some
other
phrase
because
per
capita
means
per
person,
per
head.
justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
four
propositions-wise
that
you
had
to
have
--
that
you
began
with
the
assumption
of
rough
equality
per
capita.
justice
potter
stewart
a
little
too
fast
for
me
here.
[luaghter]
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
case
you've
just
talked
about
was
new
york,
no?
justice
potter
stewart
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
none
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
new
york,
just
so
i
can
be
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
there
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
been
a
periodic
--
a
periodic
reapportionment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
constitution
every
10
years,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
going
to
be
another
one
under
the
present
constitution
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
1966?
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
theory,
would
this
have
to
be
a
--
an
explanation
of
the
--
of
just
any
conceivable
rational
recent
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
has
to
be
a
--
had
to
be
proved
of
what
actually
motivated
the
--
the
apportionment?
justice
potter
stewart
for
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
bothers
me,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
in
--
it's
bothered
me
all
morning.
you
say,
if
a
state
can
do
this,
if
a
state
can
give
more
heavier
representational
weight
to
a
seaport
than
to
other
places
and
so
on,
well,
now,
isn't
it
conceivable
that
perhaps
one
state
in
the
particular
context
of
the
social,
economic
and
political
conditions
of
that
state
might
and
another
state
might
not
be
able
to
constitutionally
--
i
mean,
what
is
north
dakota
got
in
common
with
new
york,
what
does
new
mexico
have
in
common
with
maine,
i
don't
know
the
answer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
would
suggest
this
court
may
not
know
the
answer
and
that
you
may
not
know
the
answer
with
--
of
all
the
local
problems
in
these
various
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suggest
that
some
states,
maryland
is
one,
virginia
is
another,
new
jersey
is
another,
have
large
areas
which
are
dormitory
counties
whose
population,
most
of
whose
social,
economic,
occupational
life
is
--
lived
in
another
jurisdiction,
other
states
don't
have
such
counties
at
all.
i
don't
know
about
the
--
about
iowa
but
i
would
presume
it
doesn't
have
much
of
the
--
in
that
way
of
counties
and
that
various
of
--
of
--
quite
different
factors
might
be
applicable
in
the
--
in
the
differing
states
in
that
you
--
you
can't
just
say
in
the
vacuum,
in
the
air,
may
a
state
do
this?
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
tie
it
down
to
the
particular
facts
in
a
particular
state.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
say
we
had
to
have
them,
i
didn't
say
we
had
to
have
them.
i
suggested
that
they
may
not
be
possible
to
--
to
formulate.
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
your
--
in
here,
your
enemy,
i
don't
see
why
necessarily
measuring
your
per
capita
test
by
the
number
of
men
would
be
--
would
violate
the
constitution
at
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
it
were
shown
that
the
number
of
men
and
the
number
of
women
were
roughly
equal,
50%
to
each.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
it
wouldn't
violate
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
any
of
the
counties
get
the
same
number.
justice
potter
stewart
every
county
will
get
the
same
--
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
jumping
from
one
thing
to
another
it
seems
to
me
mr.
solicitor
general.
your
first
principle
gray
against
sanders
would
say
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
in
the
montgomery
county
district
for
example,
to
give
two
votes
to
the
farmers
in
that
district
and
only,
one
vote
to
the
people
who
lived
in
rockville
or
in
--
or
in
the
suburban
communities.
that's
--
that's
one
principle.
that's
one
principle
that
was
decided
in
gray
against
sanders.
but
now,
you're
jumping
to
something
else,
when
you're
talking
about
representation
of
an
electorate,
all
of
those
voters
counted
fully
and
fairly
in
the
election
in
a
--
in
a
representative
legislative
assembly
in
the
state
capital,
these
are
two
different
subjects.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
apples
and
oranges.
justice
potter
stewart
would
follow
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
you've
just
said
--
what
you've
just
said,
would
make
anything
except
a
--
assuming
you
have
a
--
at
large
election
within
a
state,
then
it
would
have
to
--
it
would
have
to
be
majority
of
the
votes
cast,
all
of
them
being
weighed
equally.
you
couldn't
have
a
proportional
representation
in
one
of
its
forms.
you
couldn't
have
list
system
--
system.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that
it's
in
cambridge,
massachusetts,
a
variant
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you've
--
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
this
weights
votes
taking
in
to
an
extraordinary
degree.
did
that
fit
in
the
heir
system,
i
am
now
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
by
class.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
--
assuming
people
vote
by
class,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
--
assuming
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
generally
speaking,
assuming
generally
speaking,
labor
union
people,
generally
speaking
both
are
the
same
kind
of
a
candidate,
yes
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is,
if
you
read
professor
harris'
book
is
to
do
it
precisely
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
all
the
bankers
in
one
state
were
in
a
given
senatorial
district
and
the
bankers
and
their
friends
and
their
families
added
up
to
40%
of
the
voters
in
that
district
and
everybody
else
and
their
friends,
their
families
hated
those
bankers?
by
just
by
the
creation
of
that
district,
the
state
would
completely
disenfranchise
the
bankers
and
their
friends,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
just
assume
this
was
a
fact
and
that
you
couldn't
show
that
that
there
was
any
purpose
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
it's
also
true
that
it's
a
--
but
it's
a
fact
of
life,
isn't
it
mr.
galt
that
they're
otherwise
being
represented
in
a
legislature
ways
other
than
being
represented
by
a
senator
or
an
assemblyman
to
see?
in
other
words,
what
i
have
in
mind
is
that
there
is
a
bill
in
albany
of
particular
interest
to
new
york
city.
i
suppose
representatives
of
the
city
as
entity,
as
an
institution
up
here
before
the
rep
--
committees
and
the
legislature,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
mayor
and
his
representatives
in
new
york
city.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
now
about
the
representation
of
the
--
of
the
city
of
new
york
as
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
a
way
--
had
the
way,
which
it
carries
as
an
institution
more
rapidly.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
well,
i've
interrupted
you.
i'm
--
i
am
interested
in
the
--
this
business
of
home
rule
from
the
point
of
view
of
legislative
power
possessed
by
the
city
of
new
york
--
new
york
city
or
others,
do
they
have
it?
they
have
it,
some
of
them
may
have
considerable
(inaudible),
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
the
municipalities
in
new
york
have
a
considerable
amount
of
home
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
suppose
following
clearly
your
thought
into
the
question
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
true
representation
and
suppose
it
--
at
least
possible
to
argue
that
a
republican
voter
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
better
represented
by
a
republican
representative
from
rochester
than
he
is
by
the
representative
--
the
democratic
representative
from
his
own
district,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
suggest
some
of
the
complexities
of
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
the
solicitor
general
says
in
the
sentences
is
that
your
system
discriminates
against
the
voters
living
in
counties
which
contain
more
than
6%
of
the
population
and
in
terms
of
per
capita
representation,
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
when
you're
talking
about
the
most
populous
counties,
you're
--
this
--
this
has
been
given
in
a
technical
definition
in
the
briefs
and
we're
now
talking
about
counties
which
have
more
than
6
per
6
--
6%
of
the
total
population
of
the
state.
it's
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
there
frame
or
that's
there
definition
of
most
populous
counties.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it's
of
those
five
or
six
counties,
which
have
more,
each
of
them
has
more
than
6%
of
the
population
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
inevitable
consequence
mentioned
by
mr.
sand,
and
refuted
now
by
the
chief
justice
would
be
true,
would
it
not,
until
it
at
least
you
reach
another
full
ratio
in
one
of
these
counties
with
more
than
6%
of
the
state
and
that
would
go
back
again,
wouldn't
it,
to
a
--
a
more
equitable
representation
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
just
this
full
ratio
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
have
to
have
--
you
have
to
have
a
full
fraction
in
order
to
get
another
senator.
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
get
another
senator.
justice
potter
stewart
in
full
in
order
to
get
another
senator.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
in
order
--
and
if
you
do
have
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
less
and
not
--
and
no
more,
then
you
do
get
another
senator?
justice
potter
stewart
that
attempt
doesn't
--
then
tend
to
equalize
itself
back
or
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
you
divide
the
total
citizen
population
of
the
state
by
50.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
generally,
that's
step
one,
isn't
it?
and
that
--
and
that
gives
you
--
you're
--
and
then
you
allocate
a
senator
to
each
one
of
those
that
they
called
ratios?
justice
potter
stewart
ratio,
and
then
you
give
up
--
one
district
has
--
has
more
than
a
full
ratio,
you'd
give
him
up
to
three
senators,
don't
you,
depending
upon
how
much
they
have?
how
many
is
much
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
except
on
a
full
ratio.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
go
over
three
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
except
on
a
full
ratio.
justice
potter
stewart
and
by
--
and
then
the
6%
you
arrive
at
by
it's
--
it's
the
relationship
of
three
senators
to
50,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
additional
senator
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
additional
senators
which
the
counties
might
get,
by
having
another
full
ratio,
are
allocated
then
to
the
less
populous
counties,
is
that
right?
that
is
the
additional
over
50.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
add
to
the
total
number
of
50?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
you
have
58
and
then
the
--
the
apportionment,
you
have
57.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
in
the
ferguson
against
skrupa
case,
the
--
that
the
justice
there
could've
argued
that
the
right
--
the
freedom
to
go
into
the
business,
then
adjusting
the
civil
right,
couldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
could
have
argued
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
--
if
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anyway
to
hold
a
constitutional
convention
in
the
interval
between
these
20-year
automatic
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
at
any
time?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
is
then,
there's
no
way
to
change
the
existing
legislative
apportionment
formula
except
by
constitutional
amendment
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
in
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
political
history,
is
it
true
that
the
governor
of
the
state,
do
you
tell
us
has
a
considerable
amount
of
legislative
power
that
has
come
from
new
york
city
in
recent
years
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
us
that
the
governor
of
the
state
has
a
good
deal
of
legislative
power.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
political
history,
is
it
true
or
is
it
not
that
in
recent
years
the
governor
of
the
state
has
come
from
the
city
of
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
predecessor
--
and
his
predecessors,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
governor
dewey?
justice
potter
stewart
governor
harriman?
governor
rockefeller,
governor
leeman?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
answer
to
this
whole
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sand,
as
i
understand
that
you
got
roughly
in
your
argument
in
illustrating
the
--
the
report
of
inequity,
constitutional
violations
you've
equated,
have
you
not
pretty
much
in
nassau
county
and
suffolk
county
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
noticed
there
the
representatives
of
those
different
counties
take
these
adverse
positions
in
this
litigation
which
suggest
to
me
that
there
maybe
a
--
a
factors
or
some
suddenly
here,
quite
apart
from
what
it
characterized
yesterday
as
a
sixth
grade
arithmetic
or
even
eight
grade
arithmetic.
i
noticed
that
the
--
the
representatives
of
suffolk
county
says
at
his
--
the
difference
in
the
--
in
the
form
of
his
county's
governments,
he
points
that
out
between
his
county
and
nassau
county,
these
are
things
that
haven't
been
briefed
at
all
and
only
suggestively.
