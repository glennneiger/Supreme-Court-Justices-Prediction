mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
loose
no
time
in
coming
down
directly
if
i
may
to
what
it
is
to
be
a
basic
difference
of
opinion
as
to
an
issue
which
is
cardinal
i
think
to
the
determination
of
this
case.
i
recall
mr.
sand
saying
on
oral
argument,
pointing
to
certain
pages
of
our
brief
that
we
express
criteria,
that
we
use
arguments
which
actually
support
his
views.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
crystal
clear
that
on
the
matter
of
what
constitutes
equality
of
representation,
we
take
sharp,
very,
very
sharp
issue
with
the
appellants.
there
is
a
basic
difference.
i
think
it's
beyond
argument
listening
to
the
appellants,
reading
their
briefs
that
they
equate
per
capita
representation
with
equality
of
representation
and
here,
we
disagree
emphatically.
we
only
agree
to
the
extent
that
we
believe
there
should
be
equality
of
representation
but
what
does
that
term
connote?
we
see
no
necessary
co-relationship
between
per
capita
representation
and
the
equality
of
ac
--
access
to
the
legislative
process.
we
don't
regard
per
capita
representation
as
the
test,
as
the
only
test,
or
as
the
starting
point.
basically,
i
think
that
difficulty
lies
in
the
question
of
the
conception
of
a
constituency
and
the
--
the
functions
and
purposes
of
a
single
member
district
system.
obviously,
it's
one
thing
to
deal
as
this
court
did
deal
only
during
the
last
term
with
a
--
a
statewide
constituency
in
gray
against
sanders,
and
the
court
laid
down
the
rule
while
being
careful
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
to
leave
open
the
question
of
state
apportionments,
the
court
did
very
definitely
lay
down
the
rule
that
insofar
as
a
single
constituency
is
concerned,
a
statewide
election,
there
can
be
but
one
constitutional
standard
that
they
must
raise
one
man,
one
vote.
and
there,
the
law
has
done
everything
it
conceivably
can
do
to
guarantee
to
the
20
voters
within
the
single
constituency
system
the
equality
of
access
to
the
legislative
process
with
every
other
citizen,
but
i
submit
that
it's
an
entirely
different
matter
when
it
comes
to
a
single
member
district
system
with
its
series
of
constituencies
leading
to
the
election
of
representatives
in
a
state
legislature.
it's
much
more
complex.
it's
much
more
of
a
problem
because
you
have
--
in
the
very
nature
of
this
system,
you
have
residents
of
different
districts
and
indeed
residents
of
the
same
district
vying
with
each
other
for
their
legislator's
attention
and
it's
a
matter
which
comes
down
to
something
like
this.
isn't
that
a
problem
in
reality
of
assuring
that
--
the
man
let's
say
in
schuyler
county,
the
county
with
a
citizen
population
of
but
about
15,000
has
as
much
influence
on
his
legislative
representative
as
the
man
in
new
york
or
kings
county.
let's
see
how
the
question
of
physical
size
of
the
geographical
area
--
mr.
irving
galt
we
and
--
of
necessity
in
view
of
the
baker
decision,
of
course,
accept
for
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
is
applicable
to
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
the
question.
mr.
irving
galt
without
accepting
the
proposition
of
the
equal
protection
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
clause
applies
to
apportionment
cases?
well,
i
think
the
baker
case
made
it
expressly
applicable
to
apportionment
cases.
the
question
is
whether
an
apportionment
case
will
fit
into
the
condemnation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
here,
we
say
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
we
say
--
mr.
irving
galt
it
certainly,
i
think,
can
apply
and
the
question
then
will
be
whether
the
--
whether
the
well-recognized,
well-developed
standards
under
the
equal
protection
clause
condemn
the
apportionment
system
but
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
but
assuredly,
we
--
we
contend
most
vigorously
that
the
equal
protection
clause,
when
viewed
against
the
rational
that
we
will
be
discussing
certainly
will
not
and
should
not
strike
down
new
york's
apportionment
system
in
any
respect
and
i
was
making
some
of
these
references
to
problems
which
exist
irrespective
of
whether
it's
new
york
or
another
state.
these
may
exist
and
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
for
example,
the
physical
size
of
the
district
to
which
so
much
reference
was
made
in
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
in
the
appellant's
argument,
this
matter
of
physical
size
of
the
district
in
reality
is
very
important.
you
can
take
for
example
a
citizen,
let's
call
him
a,
who
lives
in
a
district
of
5000
square
miles
and
we
have
such
a
senatorial
district
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
a
citizen
b
who
lives
in
a
district
of
one
square
mile.
now,
even
if
the
populations
were
the
same
or
they
were
dissimilar
or
anything
else,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
man
living
in
the
5000
square
mile
county
has
equality
of
that
access
to
his
representative
in
comparison
with
the
man
living
in
the
closely
concentrated
county
with
its
much
greater
cohesion
of
interest.
it's
much
more
ready
accessibility
to
the
legislative
representative,
to
the
legislature
itself
and
its
ability
to
make
its
interest
felt.
i
can
take
for
instance
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
you
have
high-rise
apartment
houses.
you
can
walk
into
the
local
movie
house
and
you
maybe
in
one
or
two
assembly
districts.
people
may
be
coming
one
or
two
assembly
in
senate
districts.
it's
very
easy
for
the
people
meeting
in
a
pta
meeting
to
make
their
legislature
know
that
they
want
a
traffic
light
on
the
corner
and
they
have
no
difficulty
at
all
going
to
the
very
door
of
their
legislature
representative
to
tell
him
so.
but
it's
quite
a
different
thing
when
you
take,
for
instance,
st.
lawrence
county
up
in
the
40th
senatorial
district,
up
at
the
northeast
part
of
the
state.
that
county
alone
is
larger
than
the
state
of
delaware.
i
think
it's
something
like
2700
square
miles
and
the
state
of
delaware
itself
will
be
here
on
its
own
apportionment
case,
come
the
first
week
of
december
or
so
and
yet,
that
has
one
assemblyman
and
it
is
part
of
a
multi-county
senatorial
district,
the
three
county-senatorial
districts
that
expands
an
area
larger
than
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
what
is
important
to
a
resident
of
st.
lawrence
county
for
instance,
who
lives
near
the
seaway,
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
or
who's
interested
in
the
--
in
the
smelting
operations
that
occur
in
one
part
of
the
county,
is
of
no
interest
whatever
to
the
fellow
who
lives
on
the
other
edge
of
that
same
county
or
elsewhere
in
that
county
or
maybe
a
farmer
or
something
else.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
mr.
irving
galt
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
corollary
which
flows
from
the
argument
because
what
we
are
pointing
out
is
that
there
are
instances
in
new
york
with
all
the
features
that
are
taken
into
consideration
that
still
present
problems.
here,
we
hear
discussions
and
we
hear
arguments
from
the
appellants
and
from
the
solicitor
general
about
the
size
of
districts
and
we
know
that
this
still
occurs.
they
say
that
we
enlarge
the
senate,
let's
say.
well,
obviously
the
enlargement
of
the
senate
rule
is
--
is
intended
to
keep
the
size
of
districts
down
and
with
what
new
york
has,
we
still
have
an
occasional
district
which
is
that
large
and
which
does
present
the
problem.
and
of
course
your
honor
can
see
that
there
will
be
several
alternatives
if
we
carry
this
idea
of
enlarging
to
a
great
extent
that
we
add
so
many
people
to
our
house
for
example
that
there
can
be
no
room
for
--
for
compact
discussion
or
on
the
other
hand,
we
enlarge
districts
and
we
have
more
enlarged
districts
such
as
the
40th
senatorial
district,
we
have
a
real
problem
on
our
hand.
how
then
does
new
york
or
any
state
to
that
matter
guarantee
to
each
voters
so
far
as
it
reasonably
and
possibly
can
and
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
equality
of
access
to
the
councils
of
government?
certainly,
the
state
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
must
think
in
those
terms
and
when
you
consider
new
york
especially
with
its
extremely
or
regular
population
density,
you
can
see
the
kind
of
problems
with
which
that
state
must
conjure.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
i
did
when
we
had
the
case
right
on
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes
(inaudible)
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
galt
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
found
nothing
in
the
debates
that
so
indicate
and
now
your
honors,
i
wanted
to
say
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
at
the
--
what
--
what
that
aspect
of
the
constitutional
convention,
not
that
i
recall.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
anything
in
the
record
other
than
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
itself.
the
reference
is
made
to
the
proceedings
of
the
convention
itself,
but
taking
up
that
particular
aspect
of
it,
there's
negative
concept
that
they
did
not
go
into
it.
i
suppose
the
assumption
is
that
they
didn't
think
that
the
problem
even
applied
and
i
would
certainly
agree
with
them
wholeheartedly
if
that
was
their
assumption.
certainly,
no
one
thought
as
far
as
i
can
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
there
were
debates,
there
were
--
there
were
enumerable
debates
as
to
different
measures
mostly
on
the
matter
of
wisdom
of
doing
it
one
way
or
another,
but
that's
a
legislative
function
to
debate
the
wisdom
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
don't
recall
it.
this
doesn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
was
--
that
somebody
might
have
said
it.
my
memory
is
not
that
infallible
but
i
just
do
not
recall
it
nor
do
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
likely
to
have
been
raised
at
that
time
and
i
don't
think
that
that
was
a
problem
in
the
convention
to
the
best
--
to
the
very
best
of
my
recollection.
mr.
irving
galt
oh
yes
and
now
with
constitution.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
it's
quite
true
that
there
is
a
question
of
an
offer
of
proof
here
and
what
was
tried
to
be
done
down
there
in
that
connection
was
to
--
was
to
introduce
proof
and
offer.
our
proof
was
made
and
of
course
rejected
by
the
(inaudible)
court
to
show
the
intention
of
the
legislators
in
1894.
now
of
course,
taking
your
honor
your
own
mcgowan
against
maryland
opinion,
of
course
you
don't
ascribe
a
sort
of
legislative
mens
rea
to
a
large
deliberate
of
body
of
that
kind.
the
test
obviously
is
not
what
personal
preferences
if
any
one
way
or
the
other
may
have
motivated
legislators.
the
act
itself
is
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
constitutional
standards
and
it's
immaterial,
plainly
immaterial
what
the
legislate
--
what
the
legislators
or
the
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
may
or
may
not
have
entertained
as
personal
opinions.
the
act
must
be
judged
on
its
own
merits.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
well
i
--
i,
i
merely
attempted
to
answer
justice
harlan's
question
as
to
whether
this
or
--
this
circumstance
did
or
did
not
appear
in
the
record
of
those
proceedings
and
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
it
did
not.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
that's
putting
it
much
more
flatly
than
we
would
put
it.
we
say
that
a
state
and
we
--
in
these
general
principles
i've
been
alluding
to,
i
have
not
yet
reached
that
point.
but
as
to
new
york,
we
will
show
that
the
state
had
a
perfect
right
consistent
with
every
concept
of
--
of
federal
constitutionality
to
take
into
consideration
a
number
of
factors
and
not
to
be
limited
by
per
capita
representation
either
at
this
whole
standard
or
to
the
starting
point
of
inquiry.
now,
what
we
do
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
there
are
other
factors.
for
example,
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
i'm
talking
now
not
so
much
about
new
york
in
particular
but
the
foundation
for
this
entire
problem
which
may
have
varying
application
among
different
states,
depending
on
their
particular
situations
and
problems.
but
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
many
states,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
county
government
is
of
great
importance
and
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general,
a
few
moments
ago
very
graciously
acknowledged
that
as
a
matter
of
--
of
argument.
it's
true
that
in
new
york,
county
government
is
becoming
more
and
more
important,
increasingly
important,
increasingly
useful.
and
there
is
a
certain
analogy
to
--
for
instance
the
question
of
federal
aid
to
the
states
just
as
the
states
look
to
the
national
government,
for
federal
aid
so
in
new
york
and
many
other
states
does
the
--
does
the
county
look
to
its
state
legislature
--
state
legislature
for
state
aid.
now,
of
course
the
county
also
is
instrumental
in
initiating
legislation
in
the
legislature
and
suggesting
legislation
for
the
state
legislature,
but
let's
come
back
to
the
example
that
i
was
giving
your
honors
of
the
new
york
county
voter
for
example.
he's
represented
by
a
senator,
a
state
senator
whose
entire
constituency
is
in
new
york
county.
not
only
that,
there
are
other
senators
in
new
york
county
and
he
obviously
had
easy
access
to
the
legislature,
no
particular
problem
there.
but
come
back
again
to
the
st.
lawrence
voter
where
the
senator
represents
this
vast
area
including
these
other
two
counties
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
any
voter
in
st.
lawrence
county
would
rightly
say
under
those
circumstances
that
he's
not
equally
represented
with
his
counterpart
in
new
york
county.
in
fact,
he
has
a
situation
in
the
senatorial
district
where
two
other
counties
are
competing
for
state
a
for
the
attention
of
the
state
senators.
now,
i
say
all
of
this
to
indicate
to
some
extent
what
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
during
the
appellant's
argument
as
some
of
the
complexities
and
nuances
in
the
question
of
securing
and
achieving
equality
of
representation
in
a
single
member
district
system.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
goes
further
than
that.
new
york
county
senator
to
project
further
the
example
is
in
reality,
in
a
delegation
of
senators
from
new
york
county,
senators
and
assemblymen
and
they
very
frequently
vote
in
a
block,
not
only
in
the
county
but
in
the
city.
this
is
common
knowledge
and
it's
a
perfectly
natural
and
expected
thing
and
the
concept
of
neighborhood
in
new
york
county
for
example
would
be
such
that
a
so-called
neighborhood
might
well
encompass
several
assembly
districts
and
possibly
more
than
one
senate
district
and
it's
difficult
to
say
that
equality
of
representation
is
achieved
when
one
small,
physically
small
area
for
instance
of
that
time
has
such
solid
control
of
the
legislature
has
such
a
--
an
influential
voice
in
the
legislature
through
its
block,
through
its
delegation,
through
its
solidity,
through
its
institutional
power
that
the
interest
of
other
areas
may
very,
very
easily
be
ignored.
and
yet
--
mr.
irving
galt
well
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
undoubtedly
the
mayor
has
a
legislative
representative
up
there
in
albany.
but
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
you
mean
institution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
oh,
obviously
carries
a
tremendous
institutional
weight
right
there
which
goes
--
goes
beyond
any
question
of
its
per
capita
allocation.
i
think
and
further
on,
if
time
will
permit
and
if
your
honors
will
permit
me
too,
i
think
i
might
be
able
to
develop
that
toward
along
certain
other
lines
which
may
serve
even
more
fully
to
answer
your
honor's
questions.
mr.
irving
galt
someone
had
what?
mr.
irving
galt
very
definitely
in
the
city
of
new
york.
there
is
--
there
are
some
developments
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
with
respect
to
home
rules,
something
is
on
the
ballot
a
few
weeks
ago.
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
all
the
details
at
this
time
to
be
able
to
enlighten
your
honors
to
any
--
to
any
specific
degree
would
be
the
light
that
was
requested
to
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
that.
i
am
not
sufficiently
well
versed
in
all
of
the
details
of
that
to
equip
your
honor
with
the
information
of
this
thinking,
but
i
can
certainly
subscribe
to
the
statement
that
home
rule
is
a
very
important
ingredient
of
governmental
concept
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
galt
the
political
opposition
of
the
democratic
and
republican
parties,
if
your
honor,
i
honestly
can't
answer
that.
in
a
full
sense,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
i
live
in
new
york
state,
i
live
in
nassau
county.
there
are
certain
--
there
are
certain
attitudes
described
and
all
that.
when
you
look
at
a
--
a
governmental
process
resulting
in
an
apportionment
system,
there
are
a
variety
of
factors
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
one
of
them
is
the
natural
competing
interest
of
the
two
parties
in
our
two-party
system,
but
whether
that's
responsible
for
the
apportionment,
i
--
i
know
of
nothing
to
say
that
it
is
--
that
the
party
factor
itself
is
responsible
for
the
apportionment.
mr.
irving
galt
well
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
there
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
correct
to
say
that
the
apportionment
has
not
had
a
--
has
not
had
a
political
impact.
the
--
there
has
been
--
there
certainly
has
been
as
the
city
points
out
a
--
a
series
of
representation
like
this
but
we
have
answered
that
in
fact,
i
think
in
our
briefs
by
pointing
out
this
because
the
argument
has
been
made
in
a
broader
sense.
the
argument
is
made
by
the
appellant
and
the
city
that
the
minority
party
viewed
from
a
per
capita
representation
vote
has
the
ascendancy
in
the
legislature
but
isn't
this
your
honor
simply
misconceiving
the
purpose
and
function
of
a
single-member
constituency
system.
if,
and
we
show
this
in
our
brief,
we
have
undertaken
to
marshal
the
figures
in
that
respect.
in
our
brief,
we
show
that
if
you
look
at
the
notion
of
a
single-member
of
the
district
system,
you
will
find
that
if
you
treat
any
given
district
by
the
winning
party
in
the
district,
in
other
words,
district
x
elects
an
assembly
--
a
republican
assemblymen,
district
y
elects
a
democratic
assemblymen
and
regardless
of
the
split
of
the
vote,
it
can
be
55,
45,
90,
10
or
just
a
various
fraction,
you
must
when
you
look
into
the
workings
and
operations
of
a
system
of
this
sort,
you
must
treat
the
county
in
which
the
ultimate
representative
is
a
democrat
or
a
republican
as
the
case
maybe
as
to
all
--
all
practical
purposes
a
democratic
vote
in
that
county
or
a
republican
vote
in
the
county
electing
republican.
on
that
basis,
we
have
shown
going
back
a
number
of
years
through
the
last
four
or
five
elections.
i
think
at
page
53
and
54
of
our
brief,
we
have
shown
that
viewed
in
that
correct
perspective,
understanding
the
nature
of
this
system
that
the
percentage
is
not
that
of
a
minority
party
in
the
legislature,
actually
the
percentages
range
from
56.9%
to
as
high
as
65.5%
on
the
basis
of
the
correctly
applied
formula
for
--
for
judging
that
which
we
think
must
be
applied
here.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
those
involved
so
many
concepts
that
i
can't
say
that
i
can
answer
that
category.
but
i
would
think
--
mr.
irving
galt
and
just
--
has
just
answered
the
complexities,
but
going
beyond
that,
i
think
also
that
when
we
go
back
to
the
simple
traffic
light
situation,
when
ptas
gather,
republicans,
democrats,
minority
parties
or
anyone
else
irrespective
of
party
down
there
in
these
concentrated
districts,
they
all
can
and
do
get
the
assemblymen's
or
the
state
senators
here
and
make
known.
in
no
uncertain
time
--
terms,
just
what
are
their
desires
in
the
way
of
legislation
to
rectify
this
situation.
so,
from
that
standpoint,
the
constituency
is
represented.
mr.
irving
galt
make
no
--
mr.
irving
galt
and
he
may
not
get
the
vote.
but
the
point
is
the
important
and
the
cardinal
point
is
that
they
can
register
--
register
their
views
effectively.
and
all
of
these
things
that
i
have
been
mentioning
occur
and
yet
a
feature
of
representative
democratic
government
must
be
i
should
think
that,
so
far
as
can
be
done
or
desirable
goal
would
be
that,
the
problems
of
all
areas
and
of
all
voters
are
meet
for
consideration.
and
it's
for
that
reason,
and
the
reasons
of
that
kind
that
we
think
it's
suspicious
to
equate
the
per
capita
standard
as
the
appellants
have
done
with
equality
of
representation.
in
short,
people
who
cannot
be
heard
or
whose
voice
is
varying
people,
are
people
who
are
not
equally
represented.
and
so
we
say
that
we
can
think
of
at
least
four
factors
which
might
well
be
taken
into
consideration
in
any
apportionment
system.
there
are
maybe
others,
if
we
had
a
year
to
think
about
them,
we'd
probably
find
more
but
four
that
we
can
think
of.
first
and
foremost
obviously,
the
one
with
so
much
reference
has
been
made.
it's
an
obvious
one
of
the
per
capita
representation
idea.
and
if
the
kind
of
problems
we
have
been
discussing
a
few
moments
ago
were
not
present,
there
might
be
little
justification
for
departure
from
it,
but
these
problems
assuredly
all
present,
they
can't
be
ignored,
certainly
not
new
york.
they
do
exist
and
although
new
york
adheres
quite
closely
to
a
per
capita
standard,
there
are
other
ingredients
that
it
takes
into
account;
for
instance,
the
guarantee
of
one
representative
to
one
county,
the
minimum
guarantee
that
each
county
should
have
a
representative,
which
is
the
system
used
in
our
state
assembly,
in
one
of
the
two
chambers.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
all
debatable,
but
that,
in
the
light
of
the
close
relationship
that
exists
between
county
and
state
governments
and
the
problems
such
as
i
have
mentioned
them
and
that
they
must
be
infinitely
more
of
access
to
the
state
legislature
especially
where
the
county
governments
are
concerned
makes
this
very
often
a
vital
feature
and
a
few
moments
ago,
we
heard
the
solicitor
general
very
frankly
concede
as
much
and
incidentally,
his
fire
was
directed
virtually
not
at
all
against
the
assembly
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
we
--
we
can
give
it
to
you
on
the
brief
your
honor
or
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
galt
oh,
we
can
get
that
way
very
quickly
but
the
smallest
county
would
be
--
the
smallest
county
excluding
hamilton
which
by
the
way
your
honor
a
county
of
only
4000
or
5000
is
joined
with
hamilton
county
--
mr.
irving
galt
no.
they
are
joined
with
their
neighbor
fulton
county.
they
have
only
4000
or
5000,
but
the
smallest
citizen
population
in
the
state
until
the
record
reference
is
found
would
be
approximately
15,000
give
or
take
a
few
hundred.
i
think
it
maybe
a
little
under
15,000
as
of
the
1960
census
for
the
counties
of
schuyler
and
--
mr.
irving
galt
and
yates,
i
believe
for
another
somewhere
around
that
figure
and
our
largest
would
be
kings
county,
the
exact
--
that
runs
into
several
millions,
2,518,510
in
the
county
of
kings.
now,
of
course,
we're
talking
now
about
new
york
state
your
honor
in
which
nine
counties
are
over
500,000
in
population.
out
of
64
in
the
united
states,
a
tenth
onondaga
county
is
very
close
to
that
figure
of
500,000
so
this
merely
points
up
the
extremely
irregular
population
density
which
we
have
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
only
indicates
the
complexity
of
the
problems
with
which
we
deal
and
which
i
submit
we
will
show
have
been
dealt
with
fairly
and
adequately
from
the
standpoint
of
the
constitution.
mr.
irving
galt
now,
what
--
we
--
we
thought
--
mr.
irving
galt
we
don't
deny
that
that
could
be
taken
as
a
candidate,
yeah.
mr.
irving
galt
new
york
city's
present
population
would
be
about
8,000,000.
i
don't
know
the
exact
figures
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
maybe
9,000,000.
maybe
i'm
--
someone
over
here
who
maybe
in
that
category
for
the
moment
has
suggested
a
higher
figure,
but
it's
well
(inaudible)
mr.
irving
galt
population
of
the
entire
state,
the
citizen
population
and
as
of
the
1960
census
is
somewhere
around
16,200,000
as
compared
to
about
14,000,000
and
some
hundred
thousand
in
1950.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
--
first
of
all,
i
wouldn't
say
that
there's
a
categorical
answer
to
that.
i
would
say
that
that
might
very
well
not
mr.
justice
black
be
unconstitutional.
it
would
depend
on
how
you
would
view
the
situation
in
light
of
the
standards,
the
well-defined
judicially
manageable
standard
to
the
development
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
of
course
you
can
have
the
situation.
mr.
irving
galt
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
--
the
ones
referred
to
in
the
baker
opinion,
i
have
reference
of
course
to
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
--
they
of
course
are
the
result
of
decision
on
development
but
the
--
the
standards
expressed
--
which
were
expressly
made
applicable
for
legislative
apportionment
cases
of
course
and
baker
is,
whether
a
legislate
--
whether
a
legislative
act
or
apportionment
rests
upon
no
reasonable
bases
and
either
because
--
either
because
it's
a
crazy
quilt
and
therefore
irrational
or
implements,
some
invidious
corpus
or
state
policy
not
permissible.
but
to
come
back
to
your
specific
example
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
answer
to
it
might
be
that
in
any
constitutional
area,
a
point
is
sometimes
reached
which
becomes
a
point
of
absurdity.
and
this
court
has
never
had
any
difficulty
in
stepping
in
under
such
circumstances.
it
depends
on
the
extreme
to
which
you
carry
it.
for
instance,
we
are
told
in
some
of
our
advisory's
briefs
or
rather
some
of
those
who
have
aligned
themselves
with
the
appellants,
we've
been
--
we're
told
about
example
of
a
county
with
one
resident,
one
voter
or
one
resident
in
it,
but
this
is
pretty
absurd
long
before
it
got
to
that
point
and
nothing
illustrates
better
than
hamilton
county
with
its
4000
or
so
population
join
fulton,
long
before
it
got
to
that
point
i'm
sure,
the
state
of
new
york
would've
stepped
in
and
if
it
did
not,
there
would
be
a
point
of
absurdity
reached.
i
think
perhaps
this
is
illustrated
by
something
like
this
court's
decision
in
the
--
was
it
thompson
against
louisville,
the
situation
where
an
elderly
negro
was
prosecuted
for
no
apparent
reason,
no
proof.
now,
this
court
does
not
sit
normally
and
review
on
criminal
proceedings
of
state
courts
under
normal
circumstances,
yet,
in
that
case,
this
court
did
intervene
where
it
necessary
until
you
get
to
that
breaking
point
when
you
carry
it
to
that
extreme,
of
course
the
situation
becomes
different.
but,
new
york
system
in
any
event
will
present
no
such
problem.
as
we
proposed
to
show
to
this
court
because
i
think
this
court
will
agree,
new
york
accommodates
and
adheres
quite
closely
to
a
per
capita
representation
standard
at
the
same
time
accommodating
other
very
valuable
ingredients
for
an
apportionment
system.
and
the
fact
that
it
can
do
so
in
a
state
with
such
irregularity
of
population
of
such
size,
of
such
extreme
problems,
of
such
extreme
comparisons
of
population,
and
do
these
and
would
still
maintain
its
12th
ranking
on
a
per
capita
stand
at
the
united
states.
ahead
of
that
of
three
quarters
of
the
state
of
the
union,
i
think
if
anything
is
a
tribute
to
the
validity
of
its
system.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
test
would
have
to
be
applied
as
to
the
rationality.
we
are
going
to
show
and
we
have
started
to
show
that
there
are
rational
factors.
we
will
show
that
there
are
many,
many
states
of
fact
which
could
be
conceived
taking
the
--
taking
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
which
would
support
the
action
of
the
state
a
lot
in
the
mcgowan
decision
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
some
what
that
would
also
reject
it.
i
don't
follow
you.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
i
do
not
say
that.
i
say
that
the
only
things
that
can
properly
be
concede
about
things,
which
do
support
it.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
mcgowan
case,
that's
certainly
enough,
but
we
go
further
than
that.
your
honor
touched
upon
something
which
i
think
is
reflected
in
your
own
opinion
your
honor
in
ferguson
against
skrupa
only
last
term,
the
kansas
debt
adjustment
statute
which
if
your
honor
--
your
honor
discussed
the
question
of
exception
of
lawyers.
and
if
there
was
any
vestige
left
of
the
doctrine
which
at
the
turn
of
the
century
following
the
lochner
case
and
all
the
way
down
through
late
in
the
1930s,
if
there
was
any
vestige
left
of
the
idea
that
this
court
will
apply
economic
or
social
or
rather
purely
subjective
concepts
to
such
a
thing
as
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
think
that
last
vestige
was
certainly
removed
in
your
honor's
opinion
in
ferguson
against
skrupa,
and
that
exactly
what
we
say
is
the
case
here.
if
we
were
to
subscribe
to
appellant's
notions
of
using
these
subjective
tests
than
the
court
of
necessity
would
be
doing
the
very
thing
which
it
proscribed
in
skrupa
or
in
ferguson.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
first
of
all
there
is
a
necessary
and
quite
understandable,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
erroneous
assumption
of
fact
because
one
of
the
things
we're
going
to
show
as
we
did
in
the
statutory
court,
is
that
quite
contrary
to
what
the
appellants
came
into
court
saying
as
their
central
allegation
in
their
complaint
that
the
new
york
formula
when
applied
to
new
york
state
must
necessarily
result
in
a
grossly
unfair
weighting
of
both
houses
in
favor
of
the
rural
interest
against
the
urban
interest.
when
we
come
to
the
statistics
and
we
came
to
them
in
that
--
in
the
statutory
court
below
and
it's
reflected
in
mr.
justice
--
judge
leavitt's
opinion,
we
show
that
the
urban
counties
predominate
by
far.
new
york
is
a
state
which
is
85
point
something
urbanized
and
it
has
some
of
the
most
heavily
urbanized
counties
one
can
think
of.
the
six
plaintiff
counties
alone
and
i
select
them
because
they
are
the
six
plaintiff
county
with
individuals
from
those
six
counties,
have
in
themselves
a
majority
of
the
population
of
the
state
and
they
have,
percentage
wise,
i
think
we
have
it
here
exactly,
just
the
six
counties
alone,
without
reference
to
the
new
york
metropolitan
statistical
area
of
nine
counties
are
the
ten
heaviest
urbanized
counties.
but
those
are
six
counties
alone,
have
a
population,
a
total
citizen
population
of
over
nine
million,
56.2%
of
the
state's
total
citizen
population,
under
the
53
apportionment,
the
one
before
the
court.
60
apportionment
has
not
yet
been
made,
it's
only
a
projected
apportionment.
they
have
a
total
of
72
assemblymen,
48%
of
the
present
assembly,
a
total
--
they
have
28
of
58
senators
who
are
48.3%
of
the
assembly.
but
when
you
go
to
the
other
urbanized
counties
and
it's
beyond
doubt
that
we
have
many
other
urbanized
counties,
eerie
which
is
not
reflected
among
the
plaintiffs
and
all
the
plaintiffs.
most
of
the
plaintiffs
were
a
100,
most
counties,
a
100%
urbanized,
good,
many
of
them
90%
and
one,
suffolk
about
72%
urbanized.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
not
reading
it
from
the
brief,
but
we
do
have
that
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
not
giving
the
court
anything
which
is
either
not
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief.
mr.
irving
galt
oh,
i
--
i'm
--
very
sorry
your
honor,
we'd
get
to
that
point.
mr.
irving
galt
we
have
that
at
several
places.
we
have
it,
to
begin
with
early
in
the
brief,
the
first
reference
to
that
is
made
at
pages
8
to
9,
where
we
--
where
we
list
a
series
of
counties,
a
combination
of
counties.
we
have
taken
the
six
plaintiff
counties
which
i
have
just
given
to
you
and
then
your
honor,
at
page
9
of
our
brief,
the
ten
most
heavily
populated
counties,
all
but
one
of
which
are
over
a
half
million
in
population
and
these
--
these
are
very
substantial
counties,
very
heavily
urbanized.
we
have
shown
that
they
have
a
clear
control
of
the
state
legislature,
65.5%
of
the
senate
and
62%
of
the
assembly,
that's
under
the
current
apportionment.
they
will
still
have
under
the
projected
apportionment
which
is
not
now
before
the
court,
a
clear
majority.
they
have
a
population
of
73.5%
of
the
total
citizen
population.
i
could
go
on
with
these
enumerations,
particularly
the
nine-county,
new
york
city
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
takes
in
the
five
counties
of
the
city
of
new
york.
nassau,
suffolk,
westchester
and
rockland
and
they
have
a
citizen
population
of
10
million,
over
10
million,
10,260,000,
under
the
1960
census,
63.2%
of
the
total
citizen
population
of
the
state.
they're
represented
by
54%
of
the
assemblymen
and
55.2%
of
the
senate
under
the
projected
reapportionment.
they
will
still
have
a
clear
majority
52%
to
52.6%.
but
i
say,
all
of
this
only
to
emphasize
that
there
is
no
basis
whatever
to
what
was
the
central
allegation
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
what
we
will
brought
them
into
court
to
answer
because
the
shoe
is
precisely
on
the
other
foot.
there
is
an
urban
majority
in
the
state
of
new
york
reflected
as
a
majority,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
counsels
of
the
legislative
government.
they
have
the
majority
representatives.
and
that's
important
for
a
number
of
reasons,
first
of
all
is,
i
suppose,
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
seen
a
reversed
twist
in
this
court.
the
appellants
apparently
have
abandoned
their
theory
and
i
would
emphasize
that
mr.
justice
goldberg,
of
urban
--
of
urban
subjection
to
rural
domination
because
the
figures
simply
won't
support
it.
they
now,
speak
in
euphemisms
of
more
populous
and
most
populous
and
less
populous
counties.
mr.
irving
galt
i
--
i
--
what
i
do
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
and
here
is
something
which
i
think
indicates
some
of
the
pitfalls
and
dangers
i
suppose
of
statistics
and
i
admit
my
own
mathematical
shortcomings,
but
i
would
say
to
this
court
that
what
i
think
your
honor
has
reference
to,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
are
the
figures
of
the
theoretical
majority,
which
would
be
required
to
elect
a
majority
in
the
respective
houses.
that's
quite
a
different
thing
and
in
that
connection,
we
referred
i
think,
at
pages
35
or
36
or
37
of
our
brief,
page
51
of
our
brief,
to
certain
figures
which
compared
new
york
in
this
respect
with
all
of
the
states.
we
took
the
david
maizenberg
study,
which
was
made
in
1955
and
reflected
that
an
existing
apportionment,
which
is
still
the
apportionment
1950
--
under
the
1950
census
and
it
was
found
in
this
figure
as
accurate
that
new
york
ranks
12th
in
the
nation.
but
then
there
were
figures
that
we
used
which
might
be
somewhat
misleading
and
i
think
i
owe
it
to
the
court,
to
tell
them
about
it.
not
that
the
--
not
that
the
errors
are
matters
which
would
affect
us
adversely,
but
in
order
for
the
sake
of
accuracy,
i
might
mention
it.
at
those
points
in
the
brief,
we
had
also
been
referring
to
the
1961
national
municipal
league
compendium,
and
it
wasn't
until
after
the
brief
was
written
and
one
of
our
very
--
someone
who
wrote
it,
called
it
to
our
attention
that
we
discovered
that
the
national
municipal
league
figures
were
on
the
1961
basis
and
ran
into
three
different
categories.
first
of
all,
it
took
new
york
as
though,
we
had
reapportioned
in
1960
or
after
1960.
it
took
virginia
and
maryland
and
alabama
without
that
concept
and
it
took
other
states
as
though
it
may
have
actually
been
reapportioned
prior
to
(inaudible)
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
your
--
your
honor
was
quite
correct
there
but
i
am
making
further
point
not
only
that
the
theoretical
majority
necessary
--
new
theoretical
percentage
necessarily
to
elect
the
majority,
and
now,
you
do
that
by
going
to
the
very
bottom,
going
from
the
least
populous
states
up
until
you
reach
that
figure
which
theoretically
can
elect
the
majority.
that's
quite
different
situation,
but
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
there
were
certain
possibly
misleading
figures
not
the
12th
ranking
of
new
york
but
the
percentages
because
of
the
discrepancies
of
date
and
the
different
applications
of
the
national
municipal
league
compendium
and
to
that,
i
want
to
add
that
instead
of
new
york
ranking
second
among
the
four
states,
in
the
point
only
of
direct
relation
to
the
per
capita
representation,
ranking
behind
virginia,
i
think,
although
i
don't
subscribe
to
this
with
the
necessarily
accurate
figure
but
the
best
i
can
determine
virginia,
unless
it
has
reapportioned
since
1960
or
1961,
would
rank
under
those
figures,
14th
behind
new
york
state.
however,
the
important
point
is
that
we
do
not
say
that
this
should
be
measured
from
a
criterion
of
--
of
the
population
standard.
we
have
had
--
mr.
irving
galt
to
--
important
to?
mr.
irving
galt
oh,
well,
now
that
involves
a
question,
which
i
think
would
certainly
--
would
have
to
come
up
in
any
event,
in
the
question
of
--
of
the
exercise
of
this
court's
equity
power
and
the
standards
to
be
applied.
we
say
that,
you
cannot
give
--
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
these
shipping
concepts
that
we
have
from
the
appellants.
first,
they
say
and
i
can't
make
out
precisely
what
their
argument
is
in
this
respect,
first
they
say,
you
must
have
a
per
capita
standard.
then
they
say,
it's
alright
to
have
deviations
in
one
house,
although
you
can't
do
it
here
in
new
york
for
reasons
which
we'll
explore
later
they
--
they
have
said
that
and
--
and
this
immediately,
once
you
accommodate
other
ingredients,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
viable
decree
which
a
state
legislature
for
instance
can
understand
without
running
the
parallel
apportioning
and
reapportioning
and
--
and
getting
the
whole
political
system
of
the
state
into
a
hopeless
tangle,
you
would
have
to
be
able
if
you
follow
the
--
the
appellants
and
even
the
solicitor
general's
theory
in
this
respect,
to
give
weight
to
them,
but
who
is
to
say
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
any
of
these
factors?
this
is
the
reason
why
we
have
advocated
for
this
court
in
connection
with
its
measuring
of
the
situation,
not
the
starting
point
of
per
capita
representation,
espoused
by
both
the
appellants
and
to
some
extent
by
the
solicitor
general,
but
we
have
advocated
that
the
starting
point
in
the
highest
traditions
of
this
court
and
in
accordance
with
the
best
concepts
to
develop
decisional
law
under
the
equal
protection
clause
would
be
to
see
that
the
degree
of
responsiveness
to
the
popular
will,
the
degree
to
which
citizens
have
access
to
the
legislative
process.
we
think
they've
for
instance,
in
applying
that,
the
application
i
think,
is
--
is
very
clear.
if
you
take
a
state
like
tennessee,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
baker
case,
where
it
had
a
constitutional
formula
written
many
years
ago,
a
formula
which
as
i
best
desire
--
i
--
i
can
recall
it
at
the
moment,
was
more
on
an
equal
population
standard
basis,
on
a
per
capita
basis
would
something
like
an
apportionment
of
delegates
to
counties
having
two-thirds
of
the
prescribed
number
and
60
years
went
by
--
70s
--
almost
70
years
went
by
and
the
state
of
tennessee
did
not
even
reapportioned.
it
didn't
conform
to
the
mandates
of
its
own
state
constitution
and
there
was
as
the
opinion
pointed
out
as
the
--
as
the
majority
opinion
pointed
out
and
i
recall
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
speaking
very
emphatically
about
the
lack
of
any
such
thing
as
initiative
or
referendum.
the
people
had
no
remedy
in
tennessee.
they're
the
legislature
that
locked
itself
into
power
as
a
self-perpetuating
oligarchy,
never
mind
the
will
of
the
people,
and
the
people
had
no
remedy,
that's
one
kind
of
situation.
then
very
well,
the
state
certainly
would
have
to
come
along
and
justify
the
reasons
behind
the
seemingly
inexplicable
situation
and
that
i
think,
would
be
the
baker
case,
but
new
york
is
not
tennessee
and
the
facts
of
the
baker
case
are
not
the
facts
of
the
wmca
case.
here,
we
have
a
principal
formula
written
into
our
constitution.
mr.
irving
galt
there's
no
particular
weight,
as
such
can
be
ascribed
to
population
or
any
other
factor,
nor
is
it
necessary
not
to
use
any
of
the
specific
factors
we
have
mentioned.
the
question
is,
these
factors
being
available,
these
factors
being
useful
to
accomplishing
the
legitimate
purposes
of
a
single-member
district
system,
whether
they
are
used
in
such
--
whether
or
not,
they
use
or
lack
of
uses
--
is
isn't
--
are
done
in
such
a
way
as
to
offend
under
the
standards
of
this
court's
requirements
of
equal
protection
as
explicitly
made
applicable
to
apportionment
case.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
lack
of
equal
protection
come
in,
taking
again
mr.
justice
brennan's
majority
opinion,
if
there
is
a
legislature
which
had
done
what
tennessee
has
done
in
60
or
70
years,
go
by,
the
--
and
they
do
not
reapportion,
they
do
not
stick
to
their
constitution
--
mr.
irving
galt
then
they're
likely
to
have
--
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
mr.
irving
galt
we
sought
it,
it's
not
--
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
galt
the
question
was
what
weight
had
to
be
attached
to
it
and
i
merely
suggested
that
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
attaching
any
preconceived
notion
of
so
much
weight
to
--
to
the
per
capita
standards,
so
much
weight
to
the
question
of
one
representative
per
county.
it's
not
a
question
of
that
at
all,
where
the
--
where
population
might
under
certain
circumstances,
enter
into
the
picture
is
as
the
--
a
case
like
tennessee,
for
example,
where
because
of
all
these
developments,
it
has
become
a
crazy
quilt
without
rhyme
or
reason.
it's
that
kind
of
failure
to
observe
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
state
constitution.
that
kind
of
--
of
situation
where
the
--
where
the
legislature
locks
itself
into
power
and
the
people
literally
can
do
nothing,
which
is
not
new
york,
it's
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
that
you
may
very
well
find
that
you
will
--
are
led
to
the
situation
where
there
is
no
policy,
but
arbitrary
in
capricious
action,
paraphrasing
of
course,
mr.
justice
brennan's
language
in
baker.
we
have
a
crazy
quilt
with
outlined
or
reason
following
mr.
justice
clark's
language.
mr.
irving
galt
but
there
is
no
particular
weight
to
be
scribed
to
any
of
these
ingredients.
any
or
all
of
them
may
well
belong
in
any
well-balanced
apportionment
system
and
certainly,
the
states
have
a
right
to
use
if
--
if
they
so
desire,
criteria
other
than
population,
as
the
--
as
the
prime
standard
or
one
from
which
certain
deviations
are
permitted.
incidentally,
i
--
i
do
wish
to
state
that
solicitor
general
has
been
very
commendably
candid.
he
has
said
that
new
york's
apportionment
system
does
not
represent
a
crazy
quilt.
it's
not
without
rhyme
or
reason,
it's
consistently
applied,
but
i
--
i
want
to
point
out
in
that
connection
of
--
in
making
that
concession,
he
--
he
does
not
--
he
--
he
relies
on
something
entirely
different,
the
so-called
third
premise,
which
is
not
what
i'm
considering
for
the
moment,
but
the
fact
of
matter
is
that
there's
no
question
that
we
don't
have
a
crazy
quilt.
we
don't
have
something
which
is
irrational
or
inexplicable.
we
have
something
which
makes
sense
and
particularly
makes
sense
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
problems
with
which
it
must
deal.
we
--
mr.
irving
galt
he
contends
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
what
--
what
the
solicitor
general
contends
in
his
attack
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
be
centered
on
the
assembly
at
all,
but
the
solicitor
general
apparently
contends
that
we
discriminate
against
certain
classes
of
people
in
invidious
fashion
in
some
--
in
some
way
related
to
an
impermissible
objective
of
state
policy.
and
i
submit
that
simply
cannot
be
demonstrated
because
when
the
solicitor
general
speaks
of
farmers,
of
doctors
and
lawyers,
of
other
interest
groups,
first
of
all,
we
don't
have
representation
according
to
interest
groups.
any
group,
whether
they'd
be
doctors,
farmers
or
anything
else,
new
york
system
is
so
constituted
that
any
of
them
can
have
access
to
the
legislative
system
to
the
best
that
we
can
provide
it
for
them,
but
the
--
the
--
he
does
not
relate
that
back.
there's
no
cross-reference
back
to
the
other
things
that
he
mentioned.
he
says,
political
subdivisions
are
alright,
one
county
is
alright.
he
doesn't
relate
that
back.
if
that
argument
is
to
have
any
force
or
validity,
it
can
only
have
force
or
validity
if
it
relates
back
to
the
things
on
which
the
new
york
apportionment
system
relies
and
rightfully
relies.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
if
in
that
sense,
yes,
but
no
cases
of
this
court,
no
concepts
of
equal
protection
rule
out
discrimination.
what
they
rule
out
is
the
invidious
discrimination,
the
discrimination
which
cannot
be
justified
on
any
legitimately
conceivable
set
of
facts.
mr.
irving
galt
but
the
fact
that
there
maybe
discrimination
does
not
mean
that
there's
unconstitutionality
from
the
standpoint
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that's
exactly
this
case.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
yes,
if
it's
arbitrary.
mr.
irving
galt
do
we
not
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
answer
to
that
i
believe,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
no.
mr.
irving
galt
the
--
the
answer
to
that
is
i
assume
your
honor,
speaking
to
the
full
ratios
of
suffolk,
full
ratio
rule
in
the
senate
applicable
to
counties
of
6%
or
more,
there
--
mr.
irving
galt
there
was
a
rationale
behind
that.
mr.
irving
galt
as
compared
with
new
york
county?
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
suppose
there
is.
i
don't
know
the
exact
figures
off
hand
that
would
--
though
the
--
the
--
no,
there
would
not
be
--
mr.
irving
galt
nassau
and
new
york
county
about
--
mr.
irving
galt
suffolk,
yes.
nassau,
itself,
during
the
present
apportionment
is
in
the
situation
where
it
is
not
being
treated
as
a
full
ratio
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
it's
72%
urbanized.
mr.
irving
galt
and
it's
growing
rapidly
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes
and
the
reason
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
this
--
the
full
ratio
rule
was
designed
in
the
first
instance,
to
--
to
ensure
that
there'd
be
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
power.
that
institutional
power
in
any
single
county
or
any
small
group
of
counties
would
not
grow
so
great,
the
voice
of
small
counties
would
not
be
heard.
now,
insofar
as
these
arguments
would
be
made
about
the
counties
of
6%
or
more,
the
6%
--
the
question
of
6%
is
a
question
where
a
line
should
be
drawn
and
you
can
argue
if
i
assume
until
doomsday,
people
can
argue
all
day
long
on
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
but
i'm
drawing
the
line
itself,
constitutionality
can
hardly
earn.
now,
there
has
to
be
a
line
drawn
somewhere.
there
has
to
be
a
measuring
point
of
that
kind
and
they
draw
that
at
6%
county,
the
theory
being
that
these
are
the
counties
which
have
grown
so
populous
that
the
question
of
diffusion
of
political
power
and
the
--
the
case
which
--
which
exemplifies
that
is
still
the
rule
in
this
court,
the
macdougal
case.
this
is
an
instance
--
this
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
new
york
meets
that
problem.
this
isn't
a
question
of
just
drawing
a
line
arbitrarily
and
saying
that,
all
fellows
on
this
side
of
the
line,
all
fellows
on
that
side
of
the
line,
ought
to
be
treated
differently.
these
counties
have
reached
a
certain
stature,
a
certain
size
a
--
and
they
have
a
certain
significance
where
they
--
where
their
institutional
weight
will
take
the
city
of
new
york,
for
example.
i
don't
think
anyone
can
argue
but
that
the
city
of
new
york
has
a
weight
which
is
out
of
proportion
to
even
its
numbers
on
a
part
--
on
a
direct
per
capita
representation
basis.
the
counties
in
new
york
city
for
instance
and
these,
four
of
them
are
in
the
6%
bracket,
are
crucial
to
a
gubernatorial
election.
no
governor
can
possibly
hope
or
no
aspirant
for
the
governorship
can
possibly
hope
to
be
elected
for
example,
unless
he
can
carry
a
substantial
vote
in
the
city
of
new
york,
whoever
he
might
be.
and
it's
this
kind
of
institutional
power,
this
kind
of
concentrated
power,
which
this
rule
was
designed
to
prevent,
of
course,
when
you
look
--
mr.
irving
galt
it
might
have
some
of
the
most
unfortunate
effects
in
the
world.
for
instance,
if
you
had
just
a
single
--
just
a
single
stand
of
--
mr.
irving
galt
there
are
all
kinds
of
diffusion
--
mr.
irving
galt
are
you
asking
that
my
--
mr.
irving
galt
you
might
have
one
party
control,
you
might
have
a
splintering
of
a
great
number
of
parties,
you
might
do
--
there
are
certain
conditions
under
which
the
equal
population
stand,
it
might
if
applied
in
full
force
without
reference
to
such
of
these
other
factors
as
we
have
mentioned,
actually
militates
severely
against
a
proper
concept
of
equal
access
to
the
legislative
process
and
these
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
it
isn't
a
question
of
--
of
discriminating
them
be
--
against
them
because
they're
in
one
county
or
another.
one
county
like
nassau
maybe
in
the
50
decade
and
under
the
50
apportionment,
not
--
mr.
irving
galt
that
--
that
counties
with
less
than
6%
of
the
representation
--
6%
of
the
population
have
more
representation?
mr.
irving
galt
they're
not
--
oh,
per
thousand,
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
the
second
ratio
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
you
have
--
you
have
these
two
rules,
the
enlightenment
for
the
senate
rule
and
the
full
ratio
rule,
designed
for
the
purposes
among
others,
of
keeping
down
the
size
of
districts
and
a
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
the
physical
size,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
population
size.
keeping
down
the
physical
size
of
districts,
avoiding
as
much
as
possible,
multicounty
districts
including
multicounty
senatorial
districts,
some
of
which,
we
still
do
have.
and
the
--
the
threat
of
concentrated
power
in
a
single
county
--
the
--
the
great
institutional
power
which
it
can
will.
these
are
the
reasons
where
i
might
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
would
prefer
no
tyranny
at
all
but
i
see
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
see
that
there
is
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
made
the
point
very
emphatically
in
our
brief
that
the
only
majority
identified
by
the
appellants
here,
the
urban
majority
does
in
fact,
have
the
actual
control
of
the
new
york
state
legislature,
and
on
a
per
capita
basis.
in
a
vote
on
a
constitutional
convention
and
i
think,
you
will
find
it
admitted
at
the
very
last
page
or
next
to
the
last
page
of
the
appellants'
brief.
actually,
they
have
the
--
the
power
electing
not
only
delegates
under
the
formula
--
under
the
allocation
of
senatorial
representatives,
what
was
15
representatives-at-large,
they
could
change
that.
so,
i
don't
understand
what
concept
of
majority
rule
or
minority
rule
would
be
at
play
here,
but
this
isn't
the
question
of
--
of
entrenching
any
particular
minority.
this
is
a
question
of
being
able
to
give
to
the
people
in
the
less
populous
counties,
a
sufficient
ability
to
make
their
voice
heard,
rule
their
legislators
on
these
problems
that
are
so
important
to
any
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
suffolk
county
--
your
honor
mentioned
suffolk
county,
suffolk
county
is
going
to
get
--
mr.
irving
galt
suffolk
county
is
going
to
get
two
additional
senators
under
the
next
apportionment,
as
it
happens.
these
are
not
going
to
any
of
the
less
populous
counties.
they
are
going
for
this
county,
suffolk
county,
the
one
that
your
honor
mentioned.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
irving
galt
not
--
mr.
irving
galt
not
--
mr.
irving
galt
sure,
it
does
not.
mr.
irving
galt
in
--
in
that
sense,
yes.
it
may
not
work
out
that
they
have
the
actual
numerical
majority,
but
the
point
is
that
a
--
a
system
must
and
should
be
used
in
the
state
and
properly
may
be
used
which
does
give
them
a
--
a
--
the
ability
to
have
their
interests
expressed.
that's
the
purpose
of
--
of
a
representation
system.
they
must
be
heard
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
was
done.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
but
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
but
the
point
is
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
any
--
any
departure
that
you
might
have
from
a
--
per
capita
standard
could
be
said,
to
have
a
less
populous
dominate
and
that's
49%
or
48%
or
something
like
that,
elect
the
majority.
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
dominance.
that
recalls
something
that
the
solicitor
general
said
earlier
today.
he
spoke
of
the
difference
between
a
theoretical
majority
of
41%
in
1906,
electing
a
majority
and
under
the
projected
1960
apportionment
of
something
like
38%
or
37
point
something,
just
about
30%
--
37%
or
38%,
let's
say
37%,
but
overlooked
in
that
and
the
--
and
the
statement
appears
i
think
at
page
35,
page
23
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
is
the
fact
that
the
1950
apportionment,
the
one
now,
before
the
court,
the
figure
was
40.9%
for
the
senate.
now,
obviously,
one-tenth
of
1%
is
not
going
to
cross
the
twilight
zone
and
enter
into
the
field
of
unconstitutionality
and
if
what
was
a
de
minimis
in
1906
with
41%,
you
have
40.9%
in
1950
and
1953,
surely
no
assault
can
be
made
from
that
standpoint.
and
what
great
difference
does
38%
make?
this
is
what
i
mean
by
the
factor
of
population,
not
necessarily
being
crucial
and
determinative.
the
difference
of
37%
and
41%
is
not
so
terribly
great.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
unless
i
misunderstood
in
my
--
i
don't
think
he
used
the
terms
of
urban
and
rural
but
in
terms
of
most
populous
and
least
populous
counties
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
think
he
has
to
use
that
frame
of
reference
and
get
back
to
relying
solely
on
per
capita
standard,
precisely
because
the
urban,
rural
argument,
the
carbon
copy
of
tennessee's
complaint,
is
for
purposes
apparently
in
this
court,
not
--
not
in
the
case
anymore.
but
he
says,
what
he's
--
what
he
was
--
had
reference
to
i
think,
was
the
question
of
when
--
when
the
so-called
full
ratio
rule
is
applied
in
the
senate,
for
a
county
having
6%
of
the
population
in
order
to
gain
additional
senators
over
the
three
to
which
it
is
then
entitled,
it
has
to
have
a
full
ratio
which
is
measured
by
the
--
dividing
50,
the
basic
number
of
senators
and
to
the
citizen
population
of
the
state.
manifestly
then,
in
order
to
give
after
you've
enlarged
the
senate
by
the
numbers
of
additional
senators
over
1894,
now
had
by
the
6%
counties,
you
must
then
take
a
--
you
must
then
have
another
ratio,
obviously,
you
have
to
have
another
ratio
in
order
to
distribute
the
30
or
31
or
so
senators
to
the
other
counties,
but
this
only
points
up
what
we
were
discussing
before.
this
is
not
done
for
any
arbitrary
reason
but
to
make
sure
that
the
necessary
access
is
there.
mr.
irving
galt
on
per
capital
standard,
yes,
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
and
i
would
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
yes.
i
would
--
and
i
would
remind
your
honor,
too
that
although
we
are
not
--
we
dispute
the
reliance,
sole
reliance
on
a
per
capita
standard,
nevertheless,
we
remind
the
court
that
even
if
we
had
to
be
judged
in
that
light,
we
--
we
certainly
rank
very
high
in
the
nation
on
that
basis,
ahead
of
three-quarters
of
the
states.
but
--
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
that's
their
frame
of
reference.
mr.
irving
galt
not
my
definition.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
if
you
--
i
--
i
didn't
follow
that
last
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
full
ratio.
mr.
irving
galt
the
ratio
of
let's
say
a
100,000,
150,000,
whatever
it
might
be,
you
have
to
have
that
in
full.
mr.
irving
galt
get
--
getting
over
three
senators,
not
all
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
i
don't
know
on
what
frame
of
reference
you're
saying,
hence
to
equalize
itself
back.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
ratio
(inaudible)
mr.
irving
galt
that
it
has
three
full
ratio
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
against
three
senators
or
it
might
even
get
three
senators
if
it
has
three
second
ratios,
but
it
cannot
get
more
than
three
senators
except
on
full
ratio.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
and
that
leaves
a
remainder
when
the
enlargement
rule
was
applied,
additional
senate
is
gained
by
counting
in
the
three-ratio
class
over
what
they
had
in
1894,
that's
added
to
the
total
number
of
senate
--
senators,
that
leaves
the
remainder
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
(voice
overlap)
was
divided
into
the
remaining
population
to
give
you
the
so-called,
second
ratio.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
they
--
they
are
used
as
the
--
as
the
divisor
to
--
to
get
the
second
ratio.
actually,
what
i
think,
it
amounts
to
in
reality
and
in
essence
is
that,
in
order
to
increase
the
--
the
senate
representation
of
the
heavily
populous
counties,
the
idea
is
not
to
do
so
at
the
expense
of
the
less
populous
counties
and
not
to
take
away
representative
senators
which
otherwise
would
have
to
go
to
the
more
populous
county.
mr.
irving
galt
right,
exactly.
mr.
irving
galt
--
this
apportionment
is
58,
and
then
the
next
it
will
be
57.
mr.
irving
galt
i
understand.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
in
addition
to
the
--
to
the
illustrations
which
at
the
outset
of
the
argument
your
honor,
may
recall,
would
give
--
mr.
irving
galt
to
get
it
--
this
is
on
the
accessibility
may
be
--
mr.
irving
galt
not
merely
close
at
hand,
although
that
will
of
course,
bear
on
the
ability
of
someone
to
make
his
views
heard
and
to
make
his
--
to
register
his
views
with
the
state
senator
or
assemblyman.
but
i
was
thinking
of
ultimately
having
no
views
reached
the
legislature,
rural
representatives.
this
is
the
sense
in
which
i
use
accents
--
access,
which
is
not
mere
physical
access
although
of
course,
the
question
of
physical
access
may
very
well
bear,
when
you
have
a
very
large
(inaudible),
it
would
be
a
very
important
thing.
that
--
that
was
why
they
use
the
teeming
tenement
house
or
high-rise
apartment
house,
section
comparison
with
a
county
for
instance,
like
st.
lawrence
or
the
senatorial
district,
like
the
40th
with
st.
lawrence,
clinton
and
franklin
county.
there
is
a
manifest
difference,
very
obvious
difference,
but
the
--
the
frame
of
reference
in
which
i
was
using
access
was
in
the
ability
of
interests
to
be
heard,
people,
voters,
can
--
voters,
citizens
can
be
heard,
can
have
their
problems
considered
without
being
ignored
and
when
you
have
such
things
as
tremendous
physical
size,
these
do
make
a
difference
and
ways
and
means
must
be
found
to
permit
that
voice
to
be
heard.
now,
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
--
the
three
additional
criteria
that
we've
mentioned,
yes,
the
county
relationship
of
the
government.
most
of
these,
without
re-enumerating
them
and
virtually
they
were
conceded
by
the
solicitor
general
to
be
appropriate
and
it
was
these
--
these
were
the
things
to
which
he
did
not
check
back
however.
he
made
no
cross-reference
back
to
these
when
he
spoke
about
farmers
and
doctors
and
such.
well,
what
we
say
is
that
the
way
these
cases
are
to
be
judged
is
to
use
the
standards
set
down
by
the
equal
protection
clause
cases.
it's
not
a
matter
of
mathematical
(inaudible).
the
court
has
iterated
and
reiterated
that
time
and
again,
but
whether
the
legislative
act
rests
upon
no
reasonable
basis.
mr.
irving
galt
political
questions
in
the
sense,
for
instance,
of
the
republican
guarantee
clause
--
mr.
irving
galt
you
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
yes,
the
--
there
are,
but
i
would
say
that
mcgowan
against
maryland
certainly
dealt
with
what
you
call
--
with
what
your
honor
called,
the
civil
rights
aspects
and
--
and
that
type
of
aspect
and
yet
the
--
the
result
was
made
very
plain
and
very
clear
in
that
case
that
you
did
apply
the
equal
protection
standards.
you
did
apply
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
the
mcgowan
case
in
that
sense
is
no
different
than
this.
we
are
on
the
same
footing.
certainly,
it
makes
no
difference
to
burden
a
proof
or
anything
else,
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
mr.
irving
galt
if
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
went
that
far
enough.
mr.
irving
galt
possibly,
they
could
have.
but
the
--
but
the
--
they
might
very
well
have
argued
that
and
certainly,
i
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
ferguson
case
is
perfect
application
to
a
situation
like
this,
there's
no
more
reason
to
use
subjective
standards
here,
than
there
is
in
a
case
like
skrupa
and
i
think
that
--
in
--
in
all
respects,
in
that
respect
as
a
part
of
that.
now,
i
have
spoken
before
of
what
our
starting
point
would
be,
our
starting
point
would
be
to
look
to
the
responsiveness.
it
would
be
to
look
to
whether
a
state
legislature
has
done
something
which
was
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
supplemented
by
all
these
familiar
rules.
i
want
to
now
turn
more
specifically
to
the
new
york
formula
itself.
let
me
talk
of
what
was
evidently
a
--
a
subject
of
some
concern
to
many
of
the
--
to
those
of
the
justices
who
asked
questions.
what
are
these
three
criteria
that
we
use?
one
is
the
guarantee
of
one
assemblyman
per
county.
i
take
it
especially
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general's
concession
that
there
is
no
need
to
labor
that
at
any
length.
it
--
but
the
senate
full
ratio
rule
and
the
senate
enlargement
rule
were
the
two
that
--
the
court
focused
with
it
particular
attention
on.
and
i
gave
you
as
the
reason
for
that
was
that
it
meets
all
three
needs,
the
rules
made
all
three
needs
of
the
state,
confusion
of
representation,
giving
more
seats
to
the
less
populous
counties,
promotes
the
possibility
of
single
county,
rather
than
multicounty
districts
and
constituencies
and
it
also
restricts
the
tendency
to
overlord
sprawling
districts
and
in
the
essence
of
the
provisions
for
enlarging
the
senate,
do
very
much
the
same.
and
these
three
rules
represent
the
only
departure,
the
only
significant
departures
from
per
capita
representation
in
new
york
state.
now,
we
haven't
argued
from
the
federal
analogy,
but
there's
an
interesting
twist
that
has
been
given
to
that
by
the
appellants
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
for
a
moment.
they
talk
about
the
one-house
situation.
they
say,
after
first
saying
that
it
might
be
alright
to
have
one
house
on
a
per
capita
standard
and
another
using
some
deviations
without
expressly
indicating
what
those
deviations
maybe.
they,
first
of
all,
make
an
assumption
which
is
erroneous.
i
think
they
are
assuming
that
when
they
talk
about
the
federal
analogy
in
that
respect,
they
are
assuming
that
the
house
of
representatives
which
structurally
is
the
model
for
our
assembly
is
based
on
a
per
capita
standard.
and
as
your
honors
well
know,
every
state
is
guaranteed
at
least
one
representative,
whether
it'd
be
alaska
or
any
other
state,
just
as
each
county
in
new
york
is
guaranteed
one
representative
of
the
assembly
and
oddly
enough,
the
greatest
source
of
disparity
in
--
in
extremes,
in
disparity
--
in
extreme
disparity
occurs
in
the
assembly
rather
than
in
the
new
york
senate
and
--
which
has
as
i
say,
the
same
guarantee.
but
the
senate,
where
the
attack
has
been
sent
at
somewhat
more
great
is
actually
much
closer
to
a
per
capita
standard
than
the
assembly
which
is
modeled
after
the
--
after
the
house
of
representatives
in
that
respect.
and
we
think
it's
relevant
to
note
that
the
residence
of
the
6%
counties
who
are
the
alleged
victims
of
the
urban
discrimination
do
constitute
a
clear
numerical
majority
capable
of
affecting
a
--
a
change
of
constitutional
formula.
mr.
irving
galt
it's
based
on
population
but
it
ties
that
in
with
the
guarantee
of
one
assemblyman
per
county
and
this
is
what
accounts
for
the
disparity
but
otherwise
its
--
it's
very
well
population-oriented.
however,
it's
this
--
it's
only
this
--
primarily
this
one
assemblyman
per
county
standard
which
--
which
takes
it
away
to
any
extent
from
a
population
standard,
to
any
significant
extent.
there
are
other
rules
like
districting
rules
which
may
play
some
less
significant
part,
but
primarily
that
is
the
reason.
with
reference
to
the
question
of
conventions
and
of
the
opportunity
of
the
people
and
this
may
have
particular
bearing
upon
the
question
of
remedy,
of
any
standard
to
be
applied,
we
had
a
constitutional
convention
in
a
vote
back
in
1894,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg,
had
occasion
to
discuss
with
the
appellants'
counsel.
in
1915
and
in
1916,
votes
were
had
one
on
say,
constitutional
convention,
one
on
a
proposal
as
i
recall
it,
to
amend
the
constitutional
formula.
we
had
it
again
in
1938,
a
constitutional
convention
had
been
voted
on,
had
been
called
into
a
conclave
and
did
put
before
the
people
a
--
a
formula,
a
new
apportionment
formula
which
was
rejected
and
to
come
back
to
a
question
which
was
raised
earlier
by
one
of
the
justices.
at
that
time,
the
democrats
were
in
control,
in
1938,
of
the
state
legislature
and
yet
the
1938
convention,
the
election
of
delegates
were
mostly
republicans
and
the
people
rejected
that
proposal
for
a
--
a
--
an
alteration
of
the
constitutional
formula
and
i
come
down
to
1957.
mr.
sand
said
that
the
people
won't
have
an
opportunity
unless
the
legislature
intervenes
to
vote
upon
the
question
of
a
constitutional
convention
until
19
--
1977.
we
had
one
only
as
recently
as
1957,
a
vote
put
before
the
people.
governor
harriman
made
as
one
of
the
issues
on
which
that
vote
should
be
determined,
he
stressed
it
and
we
have
indicated
it
in
our
brief.
he
emphasized
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
have
a
constitutional
convention
in
order
among
other
things
to
alter
the
apportionment
formula.
he
was
very
emphatic
about
that.
so
the
people
do
and
the
majority,
using
a
pure
majoritarian
theory,
the
majority
voting
in
a
single-member
constituency,
whether
or
not,
to
hold
a
constitutional
convention,
have
got
the
power
if
they
so
desire,
to
have
a
constitutional
convention
and
thus
far,
they
have
never
exercised
it
to
the
end
that
new
york's
apportionment
formula,
presently
existing
apportionment
formula
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
galt
1957,
no,
i
think
only
the
question
of
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
irving
galt
that
wasn't
as
the
court.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
i
don't
believe
it
did
appear.
i
--
i
think
just
the
question
of
a
constitutional
convention
but
no
doubt
--
mr.
irving
galt
through
the
--
if
the
legislature
wishes
to
do
so,
it
can
do
so
between
the
20-year
period.
mr.
irving
galt
the
20
--
the
20-year
--
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
so
far
as
i
know
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
question
is
put
whether
they
shall
be
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
irving
galt
i
think
that's
so.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
not
certain
so
but
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
constitutional
convention,
itself.
mr.
irving
galt
and
of
course,
if
the
issue
as
of
1957,
if
they
were
elected,
following
emphasis,
extreme
emphasis
or
any
--
any
emphasis
on
an
issue
like
that
that
naturally
that
would
be
--
mr.
irving
galt
plus
15
delegates
at
large
and
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
the
end
of
appellants'
brief,
it's
before
their
appendix,
i
think
your
honor
will
find
a
concession
that
they
do
have
the
power.
i
can
get
it
for
you
explicitly
out
your
brief.
i
think
its
page
71
of
the
brief.
can
i
borrow
yours,
mr.
sand,
for
a
moment,
thank
you?
mr.
irving
galt
the
end
of
the
--
no,
i
say
that
that's
a
--
a
very
relevant
test
that
might
well
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
i
know
other
question
on
the
question
of
remedy,
the
court
of
equity
would
have
a
very
difficult
time.
the
court
of
equity
does
not
want
certainly,
normally
to
be
doing
the
work
of
apportionment
than
reapportionment.
certainly,
this
would
be
a
very
important
consideration
but
it's
a
--
a
very
relevant
consideration
to
that
whole
question
we
have
been
discussing
of
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
legislature
being
responsive
to
the
people.
mr.
irving
galt
it
might
very
well
end
the
court
inquiry,
yes,
but
--
but
it
would
certainly
--
certainly
dispose
of
any
question
of
application
of
an
equitable
remedy.
now,
talking
about
remedy,
there
are
a
great
many
reasons
why
we
feel
that
there
is
no
possible
basis,
no
possible
standard
on
which
this
court
could,
if
it
ever
came
to
that
point
or
on
which
a
court
could
fashion
it
proper
and
effective
remedy.
first
of
all,
there
are
no
compelling
circumstances
to
warrant
the
intervention
of
equity
and
of
course,
the
compelling
circumstance
in
doctrine
is
the
one
which
was
spoken
about
so
much
in
colegrove
and
the
situation
of
the
four
out
of
seven
justice
votes,
where
mr.
justice
rutledge
made
that
the
basis
of
refusal
in
this
particular
instance
to
accord
relief
and
that
factor
is
very,
very
applicable
here.
new
york
as
i
have
said,
is
close
to
the
per
capita
standard
and
the
dominance
of
the
urban
counties,
the
built-in
opportunities
for
urban
change,
the
adherence
to
our
principal
standard
in
a
state
constitution,
all
of
these
i
think,
adds
up
to
a
situation
where
there's
nothing
to
suggest
the
existence
of
compelling
circumstances.
mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
when
court
adjourned,
i
had
been
pointing
out
at
least
four
factors
which
we
were
able
to
discern
relative
to
the
problem
of
securing
equal
representation
among
residence
of
different
constituency
and
i
want
to
touch
on
them
just
rapidly
for
a
moment.
first
of
course
and
the
most
obvious
is
the
much
discussed
per
capita
representation,
which
is
an
important
factor
although
by
no
means
they
seen
a
--
well,
none
nor
to
the
starting
point
of
inquiry.
but
there
is
a
second,
third,
and
fourth
--
there
are
second,
third,
and
fourth
factors.
there
should
be
some
kind
of
minimum
representation
for
voters
of
each
county,
that's
an
important
ingredient.
i
suggest
that
also
that
it
might
be
relevant
in
securing
equal
representation
to
impose
some
limit
on
the
physical
size
of
districts
to
prevent
all
the
large
sprawling
districts,
that's
important.
and
finally,
that
it
was
important
to
ensure
proper
diffusion
of
political
power,
so
that
no
one
small
group
of
counties
can
ignore
the
needs
of
voters
in
the
other
counties.
and
i
had
started
to
suggest
at
the
time
of
yesterday's
recess
that
each
of
these
is
an
important
component
in
any
concept
of
a
truly
viable
apportionment
system
but
---
mr.
irving
galt
equality
of
political
rights?
mr.
irving
galt
if
i
understand
the
sense
in
which
your
honor
had
used
in
political
rights
--
in
the
broader
sense
of
political
rights
that
that
ties
in
exactly
with
the
argument
we
were
stressing
yesterday
of
--
of
the
equality
of
access
for
this
--
this
matter
of
equalizing
the
rights
of
voters
in
different
districts,
of
different
nature,
of
different
population,
in
this
sense,
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
placing
a
premium
in
the
sense
of
giving
a
specific
weight
to
any
factor.
and
as
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
say
this,
that
if
we
take
anyone
of
these
components,
we
have
been
discussing,
anyone
of
them
conceivably,
a
constitutional
standpoint
might
be
selected
as
the
basis
upon
which
a
state,
in
exercise
of
it's
own
discretion
as
to
what
it
state
requires
may
use
as
a
sole
standard
if
it
desires
to
do
so.
that
would
not
necessarily
and
probably
would
--
that
would
not
render
it
unconstitutional
per
se.
but
i
would
say
that
it's
specious
to
suggest
that
any
one
factor
should
be
used
to
the
exclusion
of
others
or
be
given
a
specific
weight
or
you'd
be
used
a
starting
point.
i
would
think
that
on
the
most
circumstances,
a
state
would
have
regard
to
a
combination
possibly,
all
of
the
factors
which
i
have
mentioned.
but
no
one
stands
out
predominant,
no
one
subordinates
another.
it
might
for
example
be,
you
might
have
a
situation
of
the
state
relying
solely
on
the
population
standard,
that
in
itself
would
not
be
unconstitutional
nor
would
it
be
unconstitutional
if
a
state
relied
let's
say
on
the
minimum
guarantee
of
one
--
of
one
representative
for
the
voters
of
each
county.
mr.
irving
galt
i
had
not
carried
it
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
that
extreme
as
i
recall
that
i
think
it
was
at
that
point
in
the
argument
that
i
pointed
out
that
there
are
situations
in
which
concepts
reach
a
breaking
point
where
you
can
carry
a
notion
to
such
an
extreme
that
you
--
you
carry
it
to
almost
an
absurd
indeed
to
an
absurd
extent.
and
while
--
we
would
not
go
that
far,
there
are
these
situations
of
extremes.
this
breaking
point
is
an
important
concept
but
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
not
carried
to
that
extreme
length
which
is
used
for
purposes
of
illustration,
i
suppose,
along
those
lines,
yes,
but
not
to
the
extreme
where
rationality
disappears.
mr.

quality

right.

mr.
irving

i'm
sure
mr.
justice
harlan
that
i
fully
understand
your
use
of
that
term
if
it
has
reference
to
equating
the
ray
against
standards
concept,
single
constituency
concept
of
one
man
one
vote,
then
i
don't
equate
it
if
that
was
--
would
be
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
points
i
was
making
yesterday.
if
that
is
what
you
meant,
then
i
would
say
that
this
is
not
the
equivalent.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
too
that
i
see
no
warrant
whatever
for
an
argument
such
as
the
appellants
and
the
solicitor
general
made
yesterday
in
their
briefs
to
the
effect
that
per
capita
representation
should
be
the
starting
point
of
inquiry
and
the
burden
of
justifying
any
variations
from
per
capita
representation
should
evolved
on
the
state
whenever
the
plaintiffs
are
able
to
show
some
disparity
from
a
per
capita
standing
and
no
more
warrant
for
that
approach
than
for
making
any
--
any
other
ingredient,
minimum
guarantee
of
one
representative
per
county
for
instance,
the
touchstone
starting
point
of
inquiry
for
determining
whether
an
--
any
--
whether
an
apportionment
furnishes
equal
representation.
now,
in
most
states
beyond
any
doubt,
certainly
in
the
fairly
large
and
fairly
populous
--
heavily
populous
states,
even
apportionment
in
those
states
where
to
rely
solely
on
per
capita
representation.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
anything,
it
might
be
reason
to
suspect
its
efficiency
as
a
vehicle
for
equal
representation
because
of
the
problems
of
equality
which
were
suggested
in
the
argument
yesterday.
and
the
state
experience,
in
this
field
furnishes
any
guide,
i
think
it
would
be
most
unusual
or
certainly
more
unusual
to
find
sole
adherence
to
per
capita
representation
that
defined
for
example,
a
guarantee
of
one
representative
per
county.
and
the
critical
thing
is
this,
a
very
plain
fact
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
if
the
appellants
are
correct
that
the
starting
point
of
inquiry
is
per
capita
representation,
then
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
would
succeed
in
making
a
prima
facie
case
against
virtually
every
state
of
the
union
simply
on
filing
a
complaint
with
statistic
showing
the
disparities
which
inevitably
are
there,
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
can
possibly
accord
with
any
known
concept
that
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case.
take
the
case
of
new
york
for
instance.
if
simply
to
tear
a
sheep
out
of
some
political
scientist's
textbook
or
to
take
a
page
from
the
legislative
manual
of
new
york
with
its
recitation
of
figures
will
show
that
this
state,
12th
in
the
order
of
ranking
on
a
per
capita
basis
in
the
united
states
is
prima
facie
and
unconstitutional
apportionment
then
indeed
it
squares
with
no
concepts
either
of
them
as
it
come
across
--
mr.
irving
galt
in
a
single
constituency,
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
certainly
with
the
--
with
the
underscoring
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
there
are
sharp
clashes
of
opinion
minimized
in
this
case
is
to
what
constitutes
equality?
mr.
irving
galt
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
statistics.
mr.
irving
galt
i
--
i
can't
say
that
i
was
able
to
examine
it
with
sufficient
care
to
recall
it.
mr.
irving
galt
i
--
i
did
read
that.
i
recall
it
now
mr.
justice
goldberg,
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
we
--
we
have
given
our
analysis
beginning
in
yesterday's
argument
on
the
premise
that
there
must
be
equality
and
we
have
shown
that
these
four
factors
achieve
very
well
that
equality.
if
you
go
to
new
york
state
for
example,
the
second,
third,
and
fourth
factors
which
i
mentioned
are
shown
by
our
one
assemblyman
per
county
which
guarantees
representation
to
the
citizens
of
each
county
that
certainly
tends
to
achieve
equality
and
real
political
equality,
the
provisions
for
enlarging
the
senate
which
was
to
prevent
the
more
populous
districts
from
securing
so
larger
representation
that
you
would
have
to
have
oversized
sprawling
districts
elsewhere
and
prevent
multi-county
districts.
and
in
that
connection
yesterday,
i
might
note
that
i
failed
to
stress
one
thing.
i
talked
yesterday
of
the
need
for
accessibility
between
constituent
and
representative,
and
i
did
not
stress
at
all
that
which
is
equally
important
and
that
is
the
converse
situation
of
representative
to
constituent
that
is
just
as
necessary
for
a
representative
in
order
to
be
adequately
informed
to
go
to
the
constituents
of
his
district
and
ascertain
what
maybe
their
needs.
and
very
obviously
that's
a
great
difference
in
doing
that
in
new
york
county
and
doing
that
in
a
place
like
st.
lawrence
county
or
the
40th
senatorial
district
which
is
larger
than
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
finally
because
it
leads
to
something
which
i
--
mr.
irving
galt
as
of
--
as
sufficient
for
what
mr.
justice
clark?
to
sustain
an
apportionment?
mr.
irving
galt
no,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
that.
there
is
no
one
factor
alone
which
is
required
to
make
it
constitutional.
i
--
i
say
that
the
factor
of
accessibility
enters
into
the
picture
in
determining
whether
you
have
representation
in
the
legislature,
whether
the
voters
of
the
state
are
equally
represented
taking
into
consideration
all
of
these
problems
of
which
we
spoke
yesterday.
accessibility
is
one
of
the
things
in
a
state
like
new
york
certainly
which
bears
upon
those
problems.
mr.
irving
galt
perhaps.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
we
try
in
new
york
so
much
as
possible
with
all
this
tremendous
variety
of
situations,
with
all
these
differences,
with
all
these
complications
to
secure
that
accessibility
to
the
greatest
possible
degree.
and
that
is
why
we
say
we
have
in
this
apportionment
formula
of
ours,
tended
very
reasonably
to
equalize
voters,
these
are
the
one
district
and
another
considering
the
differences
of
the
problems.
now,
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
say
--
oh
i'm
sorry.
i
say
that
our
--
our
case
does
not
at
all
stand
on
numbers,
numerical
nice
that
if
he
is
not
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
no,
i'm
not
arguing
numbers.
mr.
irving
galt
i
--
i
suggest
mr.
justice
harlan
that
when
i
point
up
an
example
like
st.
lawrence
county
and
the
larger
40th
senatorial
district,
i
--
i
do
so
to
show
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
indicated
yesterday
that
we're
trying
to
prevent
posing
greater
problems
that
already
necessarily
exist
with
all
the
well-directed
efforts
towards
achieving
equally.
we
do
not
want
to
have
this
characterize
our
system.
now,
there
is
a
third
respect
in
which
new
york
deviates
somewhat
from
a
per
capita
standard
and
that's
the
senate
full-ratio
rule
which
has
the
obvious
purpose
of
ensuring
proper
diffusion
of
political
power.
and
i
mentioned
that
specifically
because
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
answer
more
fully
a
question
which
you
imposed
yesterday
and
that
was
the
question
of
"why
new
york
draws
a
line
at
a
6%
figure?"
and
i
want
to
say
to
begin
with,
that
there
is
no
magic
whatever
in
a
figure
of
6%
itself.
in
fact
and
this
is
very
important,
i
think
in
answering
that
question,
no
such
figure
appears
in
our
state
constitution.
what
our
state
constitution
does
say
and
does
provide
is
that
any
county
having
more
than
three
senators
shall
obtain
an
additional
senator
only
on
a
full
ratio.
now,
since
a
full
ratio
obviously
is
--
is
1/50th
of
the
citizen
population,
50
being
the
basic
number
of
senators
and
of
course
a
county
with
more
than
three
senators
has
more
than
3/50th,
so
it's
over
6%
of
the
state's
citizen
population.
and
getting
back
then
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white,
"why
draw
the
line
at
counties
having
more
than
three
senators?"
i
suppose
that
when
it
comes
to
a
drawing
line
to
--
to
a
drawing
of
lines,
there
is
no
fixed
answer.
but
if
we
are
correct
in
saying
that
it's
permissible
to
place
some
limitation
on
per
capita
representation
for
the
sake
of
other
value,
it
does
become
necessary
to
draw
a
line.
and
i
say
that
it
is
surely
as
reasonable
to
draw
a
line
at
three
senators
as
it
would
be
the
draw
line
at
four
or
to
draw
a
line
at
two.
or
as
it
is
as
it
surely
is,
the
tax
income
at
$600
or
to
tax
it
at
$700
or
to
tax
it
at
$500.
now,
if
i
may
turn,
there's
one
thing
i
want
to
try
rapidly
to
do
in
the
time
remaining.
we
spoke
yesterday
of
a
constitutional
convention
and
i
just
want
to
bring
out
one
of
two
specifics
on
that.
every
20
years,
there
are
put
--
there
is
put
to
the
people
a
specific
question,
"shall
there
be
a
convention
to
revise
the
constitution?"
and
if
a
majority
vote
is
cast
in
favor
of
holding
a
constitutional
convention
later,
delegates
or
elected
at
a
separate
election,
they
are
elected
on
the
basis,
number
one,
of
three
delegates
per
--
on
the
basis
of
senatorial
districts,
three
times
the
amount
of
the
senators
from
each
district.
in
other
words,
each
district
has
one
senator,
so
there
are
three
delegates.
that
would
be
three
times
58
in
the
present
apportionment,
174.
plus
15
delegates
elected
at
large,
statewide
which
makes
i
think
a
total
of
189.
now,
this
189
under
the
current
apportionment,
81
would
be
elected
from
districts,
from
legislative
districts
contained
within
the
five
so-called
full
ratio
counties
and
then
of
course
the
15
at
large
delegates
by
the
entire
state
and
that
would
mean
this.
if
the
five
full-ratio
counties
elect,
they
can
control
81
plus
the
15
at
large
because
they
are
a
majority
of
the
voters
of
the
state
and
they
have
a
majority
of
the
total
of
189.
that
is
why
i
cannot
understand
what
i
regard
as
the
erroneous
contention
made
yesterday
by
the
appellants
that
the
counties
pictured
as
the
victims
of
discrimination
were
powerless
to
change
the
constitutional
formula.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
the
legislature
itself
can
initiate
it.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
because
we
must
comply
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
with
the
constitution,
state
constitution
and
whatever
formula
we
have.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
emphasize
this
because
very
recently,
let's
not
think
of
1977.
let's
think
of
what
is
more
contemporaneous,
the
1957
situation
in
which
such
a
vote
was
had
and
in
which
governor
harriman
indubitably
made
that
an
issue.
we
emphasize
that.
we
had
referred
to
it
in
our
brief.
he
very
vigorously
urged
it.
mr.
irving
galt
there
may
have
been.
i
don't
know
--
i'm
not
going
to
weigh
the
degree
to
which
they
had
been
involved,
but
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
to
you
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
governor
harriman
did
make
an
emphatic
point
of
this
and
that
a
majority
of
the
citizens
voting
in
a
statewide
vote
rejected
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
irving
galt
i
--
i
suppose,
though
i
can't
answer
you
with
certainty
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
the
natural
cause
of
events,
i
would
assume
so.
but
very
decidedly,
this
was
an
emphasized
issue,
very
clearly
so.
now,
i'd
like
to
advert
in
the
short
time
remaining
to
one
or
two
other
things.
we
were
talking
yesterday.
i
started
to
talk
yesterday
about
the
reasons
why
federal
equity
power
should
not
be
used
to
intervene
and
no
compelling
circumstances,
and
the
very
same
factors
which
in
our
view
bear
on
the
validity
of
the
new
york
formula
on
its
merits.
i've
also
suggested,
there's
no
reason
for
intervention
of
federal
equity
power
without
repeating
them
in
detail,
close
adherence
to
per
capita
representation,
the
clear
control
of
the
legislature
by
urban
counties,
a
built-in
opportunity
for
the
majority
to
change,
to
convene
a
constitutional
convention
and
the
consistent
adherence
by
the
legislature
to
principle
standards
embodied
in
its
constitution.
all
of
these
suggested,
there's
absolutely
no
warranty
here
for
federal
equity
intervention,
and
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
governmental
processes
of
new
york
as
a
whole
since
the
question
of
legislative
apportionment
after
all
is
only
one
facet
of
the
problem
of
giving
citizens
of
the
state
an
adequate
voice
in
state
government.
and
i'll
touch
only
on
one
aspect
of
this.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
new
york,
not
only
as
a
chief
executive
as
an
--
the
chief
executive
and
administrative
officer
to
the
head
of
the
state,
but
i
would
say
without
exaggeration,
he
is
probably
the
most
important
element
in
the
state
legislative
process
and
that's
obvious
because
he
prepares
the
budget.
he
recommends
legislation.
he
has
veto
power
which
i
cannot
recall
having
been
overwritten
in
new
york.
it's
very
rare.
and
he's
elected
in
the
--
and
of
course
on
a
statewide
per
capita
basis
where
the
majority
have
the
opportunity
to
express
their
voice
and
concern
on
matters
affecting
state
government
and
i
--
mr.
irving
galt
considerable
amount
of
legislative
power
that
has
what?
mr.
irving
galt
correct.
mr.
irving
galt
has
come
from
the
city
of
new
york
in
many
instances,
yes
certainly.
the
present
governor
comes
--
mr.
irving
galt
his
predecessor,
i
think
was
a
residence
and
certainly
governor
leeman
was
a
resident
--
mr.
irving
galt
governor
dewey
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
believe
governor
harriman,
governor
rockefeller
is
--
lives
on
fifth
avenue,
that's
right
but
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
but
at
any
rate
--
mr.
irving
galt
if
the
--
if
it
worked
out
so
that
new
york
city
--
mr.
irving
galt
it
might
be.
it
would
not
necessarily
--
it
would
by
no
means
render
it
unconstitutional
because
the
constitutional
touchstone
is
not
going
to
be
a
question
of
purely
applied
mathematics.
there
would
very
probably
be
other
statute
ingredients
involved
there,
but
of
course
new
york
does
not
present
that
picture.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
--
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
we
discuss
it
in
the
abstract
this
way
without
regard
to
all
the
surrounding
facts
and
circumstances,
there
maybe
other
elements
appropriately
to
be
considered
there
which
would
tend
to
give
that
equality
that
is
required
and
that
would
be
the
important
consideration.
the
--
the
responsiveness
to
the
popular
will
is
not
to
be
measured
by
giving
anyone
element,
any
particular
specific
weight.
it's
to
be
measured
by
the
realities
of
the
situation
with
regard
to
all
the
factors
or
with
regards
to
all
of
the
factors
which
we
do
have
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired
and
unfortunately
i
must
leave
the
rest
of
my
remarks.
