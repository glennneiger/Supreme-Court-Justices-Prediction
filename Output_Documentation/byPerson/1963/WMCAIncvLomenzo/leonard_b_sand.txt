mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
the
specific
details
of
this,
the
new
york
legislative
apportionment
case,
a
word
or
two
might
be
appropriate
of
concerning
the
relationship
which
this
case
bares
to
the
body
of
cases
decided
by
lower
federal
courts
and
by
the
state
courts
since
this
court's
decision
in
baker
against
carr.
it
is
fitting
that
the
court
today
begins
its
review
of
some
of
these
cases
with
the
new
york
apportionment
case
because
the
new
york
case
reflects
one
extreme
of
judicial
reaction
to
baker
v.
carr.
in
this
case,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
apportionment
of
a
state
legislature
in
which
challenge
was
directed
to
both
houses
of
that
legislature.
and
in
which
both
houses
of
the
legislature
were
seriously
malapportioned.
following
baker
against
carr,
with
surprising
speed
and
near
unanimity,
a
consensus
appears
to
have
been
reached
by
the
lower
federal
district
courts
and
by
the
state
courts
and
that
consensus
is,
that
regardless
of
what
rule
may
apply
to
the
second
house
of
a
legislature,
surely
one
house
must
be
apportioned
primarily
on
the
basis
of
population.
12
federal
and
6
state
cases
are
cited
for
the
proposition
that
this
consensus
exists
in
the
joint
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
the
american
jewish
congress,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
new
york
case
is
apparently
the
only
case
in
which
challenge
was
directed
to
both
houses
of
the
legislature.
both
houses
are
malapportioned
and
all
forms
of
relief
were
denied.
some
evidence
of
the
extent
to
which
the
consensus
that
one
house
must
be
based
on
population
exist
is
found
in
another
amicus
curiae
brief.
that's
filed
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
the
attorneys
general
of
some
14
other
states,
this
brief
in
support
of
the
appellees
in
the
maryland
case.
there,
the
argument
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that,
of
course,
the
apportionment
of
one
house
must
be
based
on
population.
appellants
take
the
position
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
both
houses
must
be
apportioned
primarily
on
the
basis
of
population,
but
although
we
take
this
position
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
every
state
except
nebraska
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
has
a
bicameral
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
know
of
no
such
reason,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
every
state
could
have
a
--
a
legislature
consisting
of
as
many
houses
as
it
saw
fit.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
the
state
must
have
--
must
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
somebody
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
somebody
to
make
the
laws
and
some
--
somebody
to
make
the
laws
who
is
representative
of
the
people.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
could
--
it
could
have
a
--
any
form
of
body
to
enact
the
laws
provided
that
that
body
was
representative
of
the
people
and
if
it
be
a
unicameral
legislature,
a
bicameral
legislature,
a
tricameral
legislature.
the
--
the
legislature
as
i
hope
must
be
a
body
which
represents
the
people
of
that
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
--
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
there
is
in
--
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
arise
there.
i
think
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
enforceable
under
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
provisions.
i
would
like,
with
reference
to
the
relationship
which
this
case
bears
to
baker
against
carr
and
its
descendants,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
differs
from
the
tennessee
case
in
one
--
in
one
respect.
in
the
tennessee
case,
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
in
which
the
non-representative
nature
of
the
legislature
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
legislature
had
not
acted
--
had
not
reapportioned
during
a
period
of
radical
population
changes.
there,
the
discrimination,
the
malapportionment
resulted
not
from
design
but
from
accident.
in
the
new
york
case,
one
finds
a
different
circumstance.
one
finds
that
the
--
the
discriminations
which
exist,
the
disparities
which
exist
between
population
and
representation
do
not
arise
from
accident
but
it
arises
from
a
deliberate
plan,
a
purposeful
and
systematic
scheme
and
we
submit
that
that
circumstance
calls
even
more
impellingly
for
judicial
intervention
and
thus,
the
case
where
the
discrimination
is
the
product
of
accident
not
the
zone.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
it
does,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
our
--
our
challenge
is
directed
to
those
provisions
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
which
prescribes
the
formula
pursuant
to
which
every
10
years,
the
state
is
--
is
apportioned.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
people
of
the
state
ratified
that
constitutional
provision
in
1894
by
a
small
majority
and
all
efforts
to
change
that
formula
and
change
that
constitution
have
been
to
no
avail.
there
is
no
initiative
and
referendum
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
only
mechanism
which
exists
for
amending
the
constitution
without
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
is
by
a
constitutional
convention.
no
such
convention
could
be
called
the
new
york
state
without
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
until
1977.
the
delegates
to
such
a
constitutional
convention
are
elected
on
the
basis
of
senate
districts
and
the
malapportionment
which
affects
the
senate
would
affect
such
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
were
elected
on
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
then
--
of
the
then
districts.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
new
york
state
has
never
been
malapportioned
to
the
extent
to
which
it
is
now
malapportioned.
once
the
formula
was
adopted
in
every
succeeding
apportionment,
the
--
the
extent
of
disparity
between
population
and
representation
increased
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
what
--
what
occurred
in
1894
was
a
constitutional
convention
which
viewed
with
along
the
rapid
population
growth
which
certain
areas
of
the
state
were
then
experiencing,
adopted
a
formula.
the
consequence
of
that
formula
has
been
to
consistently
diminish
the
representation
accorded
to
the
most
populous
areas
of
the
state
and
--
and
there
exists
in
new
york
state
no
effective
political
remedy,
no
way
by
which
the
majority
of
the
people
can
--
can
realistically
alter
that
formula
short
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
--
i
think
that
relates
to
the
nature
of
the
restraint.
of
course,
we
--
constitutions
are
constitutional
and
--
and
restraints
may
be
placed
upon
majorities
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
lies
within
the
power
of
a
state
to
select
any
minority
within
that
state
and
to
confer
upon
that
minority,
majority
status
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
find
that
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
provision
which
says
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
citizen
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
i
find
it
also
by
strong
implication
in
this
court's
decision
in
gray
against
sanders.
i
recognize,
the
court
drew
a
distinction
in
that
case
between
the
circumstance
which
was
then
before
it
which
was
a
--
a
statewide
election
and
--
and
the
court
explicitly
indicated
that
that
was
a
different
circumstance
but
the
court
also,
in
that
case,
said
that
it
does
not
lie
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
--
to
create
preferred
classes
of
voters.
the
difference
between
gray
against
sanders
and
the
legislative
apportionment
case,
it
seems
to
appellants
is
--
is
this.
where
one
is
dealing
with
a
statewide
election,
no
districting
is
--
no
districting
is
possible.
the
consequent
--
a
county
unit
system
is
a
form
of
districting
and
when
this
court
noted
that
the
consequence
of
a
county
unit
system
was
that
those
who
voted
within
a
particular
unit
for
the
minority
candidate,
the
candidate
receiving
the
minority
of
the
votes,
had
their
votes
entirely
disregarded
and
therefore,
it
was
bad.
the
court
was
saying,
"by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
this
election,
a
statewide
election,
there
can
be
no
districting.
"
a
state
legislature
is
a
different
body.
there,
the
members
are
intended
to
come
from
subdivisions
of
the
state,
but
the
state
legislature,
as
a
whole,
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
state,
although
elected
from
a
particular
district,
the
legislature
has
power
over
the
entire
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
have
some
home
rules,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
under
--
under
that
hypothetical,
the
--
the
city
would
be
functioning
as
an
entirely
independent
governmental
unit.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
no
--
no
governmental
nexus
with
the
state.
it
would
be
in
--
in
essence,
a
separate
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
think
only
if
the
extent
of
that
home
rule
was
really
to
make
the
city
independent
of
the
state
and
that
certainly
is
not
the
circumstance
in
new
york
in
which
the
--
the
city
is
very
much
dependent
upon
the
state
for
revenue,
for
aid,
and
where
in
fact
the
city
is
very
much
shortchanged
by
the
state
in
--
in
the
distribution
of
such
things
over
which
the
legislature
has
power.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
is
the
latter,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
into
that
election
are
injected
many,
many
issues
having
no
relationship
to
apportionment
whatsoever
and
it
is
impossible
on
the
basis
of
the
results
of
such
a
--
an
election
to
determine
whether
the
voters
rejected
a
--
a
constitutional
convention
because
they
approved
to
the
existing
apportionment
or
because
they
did
not
want
other
changes
to
be
made
in
the
constitution
having
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
apportionment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
had
no
significance
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
this
case,
mr.
justice
harlan.
they
were
submitted
to
the
--
to
the
vote.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
1894
referendum
was
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
--
of
the
people
of
the
state
at
that
time.
i
think
that
--
i
think,
however,
we're
dealing
with
--
with
rights
of
individuals
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution
and
i
do
not
believe
that
a
majority
can
vote
away
the
constitutional
rights
of
--
of
any
individuals.
certainly,
if
a
state
were
to
hold
an
election
and
by
initiative
and
referendum
adopt
a
provision
which
is
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
this
court
would
--
would
not
long
hesitate
in
saying
that
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
people
approved
it
and
embodiment
in
the
constitution
was
irrelevant,
the
federal
constitution
would
--
would
go
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
might
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
might,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
for
that
reason,
we
emphasize
the
following.
there
will
be
no
opportunity
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
the
voters
to
cause
a
constitution
--
constitutional
convention
to
be
convened
without
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
until
1977.
on
the
basis
of
the
present
population
trends,
the
--
discriminated
against
citizens
come
from
counties
which
will
have
a
minority
of
the
delegates
to
that
convention.
the
delegates
to
that
convention
are
elected
on
the
basis
of
senate
districts
and
the
senate
districts
reflect
a
discrimination
against
the
voters
in
the
most
populous
counties.
they
were
submitted
to
the
voters
in
1957
the
question
whether
or
not
a
constitutional
convention
should
be
convened.
it
was
submitted
in
an
off
year
and
the
--
and
the
voting
returns
were
light.
more
--
more
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
the
--
the
state
constitution
requires
that
every
20
years,
there'll
be
submitted
to
the
people
a
question,
"shall
there
be
a
constitutional
convention?"
and
that
is
the
question
as
it
appeared
upon
the
ballot.
a
majority
of
the
voters
voting
rejected
that.
they
were
--
they
were
injected
into
that
election
issue,
many
other
issues
totally
unrelated
to
apportionment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
issue
was
whether
there
should
be
a
revision
of
the
entire
constitution.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
aspects
of
that
constitution
is
apportionment.
one
--
one
prominent
government
official
urged
that
the
voters
reject
the
constitutional
convention
because
it
was
an
inefficient
method
of
amending
the
constitution
and
suggested
that
it
could
be
more
effectively
done
by
a
commission.
a
commission
was
subsequently
convened.
it
was
originally
headed
by
governor
rockefeller
and
then
subsequently
by
--
by
judge
peck.
when
the
commission
proceeded,
when
it
disposed
of
technical
revisions
of
the
constitution
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
question
of
revision
of
the
apportionment
provisions,
its
term
expired
and
it
was
not
renewed,
which
--
which
was
an
unusual
circumstance
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
would
like
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
its
life,
there
was
a
--
a
report
made
to
it
in
which
there
was
a
complete
analysis
of
the
new
york
apportionment
and
suggested
revisions.
its
life,
its
tenure
ended
prior
to
formal
action
on
that
recommendation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
believe
there
was
one
constitutional
convention
since
that
--
since
that
time.
i
believe
there
has
been
one.
there
have
--
i
was
advised
there
have
been
two.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i've
been
advised
there
have
been
two
since
1894.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
apportionment
itself,
to
the
formula
which
we
challenge
and
the
challenge
is
directed
to
the
formula
itself.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
requires
something
less
than
that,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
our
--
our
position
is
that
the
beginning
point,
the
starting
point
to
measure
the
validity
of
a
particular
apportionment
is
the
extent
to
which
it
bears
a
relationship
to
the
population
of
the
--
of
the
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
let
me
--
let
me
say
that
in
new
york
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
an
i
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
that
federal
standard
prohibits
a
state
from
selecting
a
minority
group
within
that
state
regardless
of
the
nature
of
that
minority
whether
it
be
based
on
race
or
--
or
any
other
basis.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
--
this,
as
appellant
see
it,
this
is
a
question
of
whether
an
individual
who
is
a
member
of
a
class
whose
votes
are
discounted
because
the
legislature
has
selected
some
other
group
and
has
given
to
that
other
group
a
preferred
position,
an
additional
power,
where
the
member
of
such
a
class
has
--
has
individual
rights
enforceable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
concept
of
--
of
equality
of
all
people
within
a
state
and
we're
dealing
here
with
the
most
basic
civil
liberty
which
those
--
which
those
people
have.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
find
that
in
the
implications
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
--
as
suggested
by
this
court
in
baker
against
carr
and
as
exists
by
--
by
analogy
in
the
decision
and
language
of
this
court
in
gray
v.
sanders.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
except,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
applicability
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
questions
of
legislative
apportionment
and
--
and
from
that
flows
everything
else
that
--
that
i've
urged
upon
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
turn
to
the
senate
formula
because
it
becomes
apparent
from
that
formula
that
precisely
what
the
state
has
done
is
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
criteria
which
are
irrelevant
to
any
function
of
the
state,
any
purpose
of
the
state
other
than
to
diminish
the
voting
rights
of
certain
members
of
the
state.
the
senate
is
apportioned
by
what
amounts
to
two
entirely
different
formulae.
one
of
which
applies
to
those
counties
having
6%
or
more
of
the
population,
just
we
referred
to
as
the
most
populous
counties,
the
other
which
applies
to
the
balance
of
the
counties.
the
senators
are
apportioned
to
the
most
populous
counties
on
the
assumption
that
the
total
size
of
the
senate
is
to
be
50
and
one
senator
is
apportioned
for
each
2%
of
the
population.
next,
the
number
of
seats
which
are
given
to
the
populous
counties
are
compared
with
the
number
of
seats
which
were
apportioned
to
those
counties
in
1894
and
the
total
senate
membership
is
increased
by
the
extent
to
which
there
has
been
any
increase
in
the
allotment
of
senators
to
those
counties
as
compared
to
1894.
for
example,
if
one
of
the
most
populous
counties
had
seven
senators
under
the
new
apportionment
and
had
only
two
in
1894,
the
total
size
of
the
senate
is
increased
by
five.
after
this
was
done,
the
balance
of
the
original
50
senate
seats
and
all
of
the
added
seats,
all
of
the
added
seats
are
apportioned
to
the
less
populous
counties.
the
less
populous
counties
receive
senators
on
the
basis
of
the
actual
size
of
the
senate,
not
the
--
not
the
50.
the
consequence
of
which
is,
senators
are
apportioned
to
the
less
populous
counties
on
the
basis
of
an
entirely
different
smaller
ratio.
i
like
to
emphasize
what
this
rule
for
senate
expansion
does
and
does
not
do.
there
is
not
now
and
there
has
never
been
in
new
york,
a
rule
that
each
county
will
have
one
senator.
counties
are
combined
for
the
purposes
of
forming
senate
districts.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
are
62
counties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
are,
at
present,
57
senators.
on
the
basis
of
the
1960
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
census,
there
will
be
58
senators.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
if
it's
the
other
--
there
are
now
58
there
will
be
57.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
rule
goes
far
beyond,
this
rule
for
senate
expansion
goes
far
beyond
anything
which
would
be
necessary
to
assure
to
the
less
populous
counties,
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
representation
for
a
certain
absolute
representation.
this
could
be
accomplished
by
saying
the
less
populous
county
shall
never
have
less
than
x
senators.
and
then
when
there
is
an
increase
in
the
size
of
the
most
populous
counties
--
increase
the
--
the
size
of
the
senate
and
distribute
that
increase
proportionately
among
both
--
between
both
groups
of
counties.
what
happens
as
a
result
of
this
formula
is
that
the
larger,
the
most
populous
counties
become,
the
larger
the
senate
becomes.
the
larger
the
senate
becomes,
the
greater
becomes
the
disparity
between
the
ratio
upon
which
senators
are
assigned
to
the
most
populous
counties
and
the
ratio
upon
which
they
are
assigned
to
the
less
populous
counties.
there
is
somewhat
startling
and
paradoxical
operation
of
this
formula
as
such,
that
the
larger,
the
most
populous
counties
become,
the
more
underrepresented
they
become.
the
larger
the
most
populous
counties
become,
the
more
overrepresented
the
less
populous
counties
become.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
mathematical
operation
of
this
formula
is
such
that
the
proportion
of
the
disparity
becomes
greater
which
--
which
does
not
usually
happen.
the
proportion
of
disparity
becomes
greater
because
they
increase
in
the
size
of
the
most
populous
counties
causes
an
increase
in
the
total
size
of
the
senate
and
that
increase
is
not
reflect
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
goes
--
goes
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
entirely
to
the
less
populous
counties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
are
other
arbitrary
provisions
with
respect
to
the
senate
formula
which
--
which
are
also
irrelevant
to
any
purpose
other
than
to
discriminate
which
aggravate
the
situation.
for
example,
when
one
of
the
most
populous
counties
loses
seats,
that
reduction
in
size
is
entirely
disregarded
in
this
formula.
in
other
words
--
to
take
an
actual
example,
new
york
and
bronx
county
had
12
senate
seats
in
1894.
on
the
basis
of
the
present
census
figures,
they
will
be
entitled
to
only
eight
senate
seats,
a
reduction
of
four.
the
other
foremost
populous
counties
in
the
same
category
have
seven
more
seats
than
in
1894.
there
is
a
net
increase
of
three,
but
since
the
increases
are
taken
into
account
while
the
decreases
are
totally
disregarded,
seven
additional
seats
rather
than
then
the
net
of
three
will
be
assigned
to
the
less
populous
counties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
believe
it
would,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
–
i
would
say
this
at
a
minimum.
when
the
net
result
of
applying
whatever
formula
the
state
devises
is
to
produce
a
legislature,
the
members
of
which
are
--
are
elected
on
the
basis,
which
is
radically
disproportionate
to
population,
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
state
and
the
state
must
then
come
in
and
say,
"we
have
adopted
this
method
of
apportioning
our
legislature
because
we
feel
it
more
effectively
represents
the
people.
i
don't
think
this
court
need
forever
close
the
door
upon
experimentation
by
states
in
--
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
if
--
and
if
the
net
result
of
that
was
to
cause
there
to
be
a
legislature,
the
members
of
which
did
not
represent
population,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
what
--
what
i
mean
to
suggest
by
the
form
of
my
reply,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
nobody
is
--
is
saying
that
because
the
legislature
must
be
proportioned
to
population,
we
throw
out
the
--
the
map
of
the
state.
we
disregard
natural
boundaries,
we
disregard
political
subdivisions.
the
legislature
may
consider
all
of
this
and
may
consider
more,
but
in
apportioning
representatives
on
the
basis
of
these
criteria,
the
net
result
must
be
a
legislature
which
proportionately
represents
population.
and
where
it
does
not,
when
it
does
not,
then
at
a
minimum,
the
burden
is
upon
the
state
to
come
forth
and
to
say,
"we
have
adopted
this
method
because
this
method
achieves
greater
representativeness
of
the
legislature.
"
now,
that
is
not
what
new

state
had

mr.

i

i

that's
true,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
--
i
think
particularly
with
regard
to
new
york
state
the
most
significant
consequence
of
the
malapportionment
doesn't
exist
in
--
in
any
of
these
statistics
to
which
i've
had
reference.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'm
familiar
with
proportionate
representation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
confess
that
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
that
--
with
that
form
of
--
with
that
form
of
(inaudible).
i
think
the
state
can
devise
whatever
election
techniques
it
will,
provided
that
there
are
--
that
there
are
certain
--
there
are
certain
essential
ingredients
to
it.
one
of
which
must
be
that
it
does
not
represent
a
conscious
discrimination
by
the
state
against
any
particular
class
or
group
within
the
state
and
--
and
none
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
--
no,
they
could
not,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
for
one
thing
there
would
not
be
a
purposeful
systematic
discrimination
against
--
against
that
minority.
it
would
not
be
the
inevitable
consequence
that
in
every
election,
they
would
be
the
minority.
what
new
york
state
has
done
is
adopted
a
rule
pursuant
to
which
in
every
apportionment,
the
same
citizens
are
discriminated
against
in
both
the
senate
and
the
assembly
and
--
and
whatever
theories
may
exist
as
to
the
nature
of
representation,
no
theory
that
we
know
of
is
constitutionally
permissible
which
would
enable
a
state
to
say,
"we
do
not
think
that
this
group
of
people,
that
these
voters
should
have
as
much
power
as
much
influence
in
the
state
as
some
other
group
of
voters."
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.

stewart,
because
we're
dealing
with
the
rights
of
individual
citizens

with
what
you

mr.

i

i
think
it

read

the
45%

the

is
a

body.
mr.

it
is

it
is
a

body

it
doesn't

it
--
it
is
two
things.
it
both
represents
the
particular
areas
and
it
has
comprehensive
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
state.
we're
not
talking
about
election
for
mayor.
nobody
would
care
then
what
the
size
of
the
particular
city
would
be
because
the
mayor
would
have
jurisdiction
over
that
city.
to
the
extent
under
your
hypothetical,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
the
extent
to
which
the
political
subdivision
was
--
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
and
power
of
the
state
legislature,
to
that
extent,
as
long
as
there
is
a
meaningful
jurisdiction
in
this
--
in
the
state
body
over
that
subdivision,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
there
cannot
be
a
discrimination
against
any
--
any
particular
one
of
those
subdivisions
in
the
election
of
the
--
of
the
statewide
body.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
--
would
make
meaningless
a
debate
over
the
--
the
question
whether
the
state
should
adopt
an
apportionment
formula
which
discriminates
against
any
group
with
--
within
the
--
within
the
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
that
is
exactly
the
position,
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
--
and
interestingly
enough,
the
state
itself
apparently
agrees
in
its
reading
of
the
federal
constitution
with
the
appellants
that
the
state
asserts
at
page
13
of
the
--
of
the
state's
brief,
"to
be
sure
our
democratic
tradition
demands
that
all
men
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
councils
of
government"
and
the
state
repeats
this.
this
--
its
reading
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution,
at
page
24
of
its
brief
and
it
--
it
states,
"we
share
appellants'
concern
that
all
men
should
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
counsels
of
government.
our
democratic
tradition
demands
no
less
of
us,
cf.
gray
v.
sanders.
"
this
is
the
way
the
state
reads
the
mandate
of
the
federal
constitution
and
one
final
reference
to
the
state's
interpretation
of
what
the
federal
constitution
requires,
state
asserts
at
--
at
page
32
of
its
brief,
"the
important
value
is
that
each
citizen,
no
matter
whether
he
lives
in
the
district
spanning
a
large
area
or
one
that
is
relatively
compact,
whether
he
lives
in
a
highly
populous
county
or
in
a
county
with
a
small
electorate,
whether
he
lives
in
a
thickly
populated
area
or
a
thinly
populated
area
should
have
equal
access
to
the
legislative
process,
so
that
the
legislature
maybe
responsive
to
his
needs.
"
i
--
i
emphasize
that
this
comes
from
the
brief
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
state
of
new
york
construes
the
federal
constitution
to
require
that
each
citizen
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
government,
but
the
state
says,
"in
measuring
that
equal
voice,
we
--
we
don't
even
begin
with
a
population
basis.
"
the
state
says,
"to
achieve
equality,
we
--
we
create
disparities.
"
what
--
what
the
state
says
in
essence
is
that
in
new
york,
all
--
all
citizens
are
equal
but
some
citizens
are
more
equal
than
others.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
can
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
if
the
consequence
of
not
doing
that
is
to
cause
the
legislature
to
be
grossly
disproportionate
to
population,
then
it
cannot,
but
it
is
--
it
is
certainly
possible
for
the
state
to
apportion
with
respect
to
political
subdivisions
and
giving
minimum
representation
to
political
subdivisions
and
--
and
still
have,
as
a
net
result,
a
legislature
which
is
proportionate
to
population.
i
--
i
would
like
--
mr.
leonard
b.

it
--
it
would
but
it
could
not
impose
a
size
limitation
and
then
also
impose
other
rules
such
as
a
one
per
county
rule,
which
would
--
the
net
effect
of

of
both
rules
being
to
produce
a

a
legislature
which
can
be
elected
by
a
--
by
a
small
minority.

depending
on
the

the

of

and
the

of

of
the

body.
mr.

yes,
yes.

mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
nor
is
there
anything
which
appellants
have
been
suggesting
which
would
--
which
would
preclude
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
those
are
questions
which
would
have
to
be
resolved
after
there
were
created
such
a
legislature.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
then
such
a
legislature
would
have
to
be
measured
and
--
and
judged
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
it
was
represented
above
the
people.
i
--
if
i
might
pursue
for
a
moment
about
the
significance,
as
we
see
it,
of
the
--
of
the
state's
position
because
the
state
or
states
that
other
criteria
maybe
considered
only
insofar
as
they
achieve
greater
equality.
the
state
does
not
purport
to
say
that
we
can
have
a
--
a
waiting
system
or
we
can
have
a
preferred
class.
the
state
agrees
that
under
the
federal
constitution,
each
citizen
must
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
legislature
and
any
other
criteria
must
be
justified
by
the
state.
we
say
then,
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
it
--
it
achieves
that
criteria,
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
emphasize
one
--
one
other
fact
with
respect
to
the
necessary
scope
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
case.
because
both
houses
are
malapportioned
and
because
challenge
is
directed
to
both
houses
and
--
if
the
rule
adopted
by
this
court
is
an
acceptance
of
the
consensus
which
has
been
reached
by
the
lower
courts
that
at
least
one
house
must
be
proportionate
to
population,
that
is
all
that
need
be
decided
in
this
case
for
a
determination
that
one
house
must
be
proportionate
to
population,
in
new
york,
would
lead
to
an
invalidation
of
the
apportionment
of
both
houses.
the
state
--
it
is
impossible
in
new
york
to
determine
which
house
would
be
selected
as
the
body
to
represent
population
if
the
rule
enunciated
by
this
court
is
that
at
least
one
house
must
--
must
represent
population
or
that
there
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
one
house
must
be
proportionate
to
population.

dealing
with
the
specific
facts
in
the
new
york
case
and
--
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
sir.
my
--
my
--
the
thrust
of
my
argument
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
it
is
unnecessary
in
the
--
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
that
the
apportionment
of
both
houses
be
based
on
population
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
for
the
state
has
conceded
at
--
at
page
61
of
its
brief
that
it
is
impossible
in
new
york
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
the
senate
or
whether
it
would
be
the
assembly
which
would
be
the
house
which
must
be
proportionate
to
population.
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
structure
of
the
state
government
which
would
lead
to
a
choice
as
to
either
the
senate
or
the
assembly,
since
both
provisions,
the
apportionment
provisions
with
respect
to
both
houses,
are
contained
in
the
state
constitution,
the
only
way
in
which
the
legislature
can
choose
which
of
its
houses
would
be
proportionate
to
population
would
be
if
this
--
if
the
court
were
to
declare
that
the
apportionment
provisions
with
respect
to
both
are
invalid.
otherwise,
the
legislature
could
proceed
by
a
statute
with
respect
to
one
house
but
could
proceed
only
by
constitutional
amendment
with
respect
to
the
other
house
and
that
would
--
that
would
take
many,
many
years.
therefore,
a
conclusion
reached
by
this
court
that
the
consensus
of
the
state
court
decisions
and
of
the
lower
federal
court
decisions
that
at
a
minimum
one
house
must
be
proportionate
to
population
if
accepted
by
this
court,
would
lead
to
the
result
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
decision
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
declare
the
apportionments
of
both
the
new
york
senate
and
assembly,
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
with
the
leave
of
the
court,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
--
we
have
appeared
before
the
court
on
behalf,
not
only
of
the
appellants,
but
also
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
county
of
nassau
at
the
least
in
this
case
but
who
have
supported
the
--
the
positions
of
the
appellants
and
we
file
briefs
in
that
support
and
are
represented
by
--
by
counsel
together
with
my
co-counsel,
mr.
max
gross.
the
principal
point
which
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
make
in
the
brief
time
remaining
is
that,
even
if
it
be
assumed
solely
for
purposes
of
argument
that
accessibility
is
a
valid
criterion,
the
senate
rule
was
not
designed
with
that
criterion
in
mind.
the
operation
of
the
senate
rule
is
not
such
as
to
limit
the
geographical
size
of
the
senate
districts.
the
state's
own
examples
of
the
large
senate
districts
which
exist
under
the
formula
indicate
that
fact
in
comparison
of
present
senate
districts
with
those
in
1894
will
show
that
in
fact
geography
has
been
disregarded.
what
the
senate
rule
does
is
precisely
what
it
was
designed
and
intended
to
do
to
discriminate
against
the
residence
of
the
most
populous
areas
with
respect
to
their
representation
in
the
legislature.
the
formula
operates
in
such
a
way
as
i
--
as
i
urged
yesterday
as
to
cause
a
disproportionate
increase
in
the
extent
of
overrepresentation
of
the
rural
areas
as
the
most
populous
areas
increase
in
size.
there
are
two
rules
with
respect
to
the
senate
formula.
one
is
the
full
--
the
senate
expansion
rule
to
which
i
have
referenced
yesterday.
there
is
another
totally
independent
rule
which
is
the
full
ratio
rule
which
also
discriminates
against
the
residence
of
the
most
populous
counties.
it
was
suggested
yesterday
in
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
--
that
the
inequities
caused
by
the
full
ratio
rule
are
corrected
when
a
particular
county
achieves
a
full
ratio.
that
maybe
true
but
the
basic
inequity
which
causes
the
growing
disproportion
arises
by
virtue
of
a
solely
independent
rule,
the
senate
expansion
rule.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
a
comparison
has
been
made
between
nassau
and
suffolk
county.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
may
i
--
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
the
difference
between
suffolk
county
and
nassau
county
is
--
is
very
significant
here.
nassau
county
is
a
--
is
a
6%
county.
it
is
discriminated
against
by
virtue
of
the
senate
apportionment
rule.
suffolk
county
is
not
a
6%
county.
it
is
not
discriminated
against.
and
therefore,
although
they
are
contiguous
and
although
their
circumstances
are
very
similar,
they
are
treated
very
differently
by
the
legislature
simply
because
one
falls
in
for
the
category
of
counties
discriminated
against
and
the
other
is
not
within
that
county
--
not
within
that
category.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
