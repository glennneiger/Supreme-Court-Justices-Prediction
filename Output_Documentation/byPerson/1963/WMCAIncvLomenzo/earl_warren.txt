chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand,
may
i
inquire
about
the
constitutional
convention
that's
provided
for
every
20
years,
that
is
the
opportunity
of
the
people
to
vote
on
it?
is
there
any
opportunity
for
them
to
vote
on
the
question
of
whether
they
will
have
reapportionment,
a
new
reapportionment
under
the
constitution
or
is
the
whole
constitution
subject
to
amendment
than
revision
if
they
do
have
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand,
may
i
ask
one
more
question
about
that?
how
many
times
have
the
people
exercised
their
right
to
have
a
constitutional
revision
since
1894
under
this
20-year
provision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice

warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
galt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
go
into
that
of
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
go
into
that
at
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
thought
in
the
court
below
that
counsel
tried
to
show
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
constitution
makers
and
they
were
denied
that
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
was
your
position
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
you
answered
mr.
justice
harlan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
--
to
what
extent
this
population
important
in
this
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
--
in
reapportionment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
learned
about
that
formula
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
part
should
population
play?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
contends
it's
arbitrary,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
arbitrary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
galt,
i
understood
mr.
sand's
(inaudible)
that
the
importance
of
the
rural
or
the
urban
counties
grew
and
unless
the
rural
counties
grew
a
greater
disparity
there
became
between
the
urban
representation
and
the
rural
representation
in
favor
of
the
rural
representation,
is
that
true,
of
necessity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
well,
let's
put
it
that
way,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
does
it
lead
to
less
proportionate
representation
for
the
most
populous
communities
and
greater
representation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
a
matter
of
necessity
under
the
formula.
it
just
has
to
go
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
always.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
your
--
is
your
apportionment
of
your
assembly
based
on
population?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
put
--
can
you
put
an
individual
measure
like
that
on
the
ballot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
connection
with
the
constitutional
convention,
can
it
submit
the
one
issue
of
apportionment
calls
the
other,
as
to
the
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
what
i
understood
counsel
in
the
other
side
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

appellants,
versus
caroline
k.
simon,
secretary
of

of
the
state
of

york,
et
al.
mr.
galt,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
galt,
may
i
ask
you
this
--
this
question
if
--
if
using
this
formula,
that
is
used
by
new
york
and
using
the
criteria
that
you
have
raised
here.
if
the
result
was
to
give
25%
to
the
people
from
new
york
control
the
both
houses
of
the
legislature,
would
you
say
it
was
constitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
no.
if
it
worked
out
instead
of
being
for
40
in
one
house
and
41
point
something
in
the
other
house,
it
was
reduced
to
25%
in
each
house,
would
you
say
it
was
still
constitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand?
