mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
one
of
four
arising
from
new
york,
alabama,
maryland
and
virginia
that
require
the
court
to
rule
for
the
first
time
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
apportionment
of
seats
in
a
state
legislature.
the
ultimate
question
to
which
all
four
of
cases
point
is
what
is
the
meaning,
in
the
field
of
legislative
apportionment,
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
to
put
in
a
little
differently,
by
what
standards,
by
what
criteria
giving
meaning
to
the
phrase
"equal
protection"
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
apportionment
to
be
judged.
neither
these
cases
nor
any
other
single
case
or
group
of
cases
can
supply
the
complete
answers
to
the
ultimate
question.
we
need
to
keep
the
ultimate
question
in
mind,
however,
because
whatever
is
decided
here
must
fit
a
coherent
analysis,
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
argument,
and
must
be
susceptible
of
being
reduced
to
generalizations
that
are
good
across
the
board.
but
at
the
same
time,
this
can
be
made
a
manageable
problem,
i
think,
only
by
adhering
to
the
traditional
process
of
deciding
the
cases
before
the
court
and
leaving
other
questions
that
logically
don't
have
to
be
decided
to
the
future,
provided
they
can
genuinely
be
left
open
and
nothing
is
said
that
necessarily
determines
it.
in
an
effort
to
steer
that
kind
of
little
course,
i
shall
not
confine
myself
to
the
present
new
york
case,
but
will
try
to
give
an
answer
that
is
comprehensive
enough
to
cover
these
four
cases
and
to
make
a
start
on
the
problem
as
one
might
put
it
of
implementing
baker
and
carr,
but
i
shall
go
no
farther.
there
are
clearly
some
questions
that
i
leave
to
the
future.
we
propose
four
general
principles
which
i
would
like
to
state
first
summarily
then
i'm
going
to
come
back
to
each
in
an
effort
to
clarify
its
meaning
and
indicate
the
reasoning
that
lies
behind
it.
first,
we
say
that
the
starting
point
and
this
hardly
says
anything,
that
the
starting
point
in
adjudicating
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
apportionment
is
the
representation
accorded
qualified
voters'
per
capita.
i'm
simply
asserting
a
measuring
stick.
i'm
not
asserting
anything
about
its
constitutional
validity
or
invalidity
in
that
proposition.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
two
voters
are
treated
alike
or
whether
they're
treated
differently
or
whether
the
voters
in
cayuga
county
are
treated
differently
from
the
voters
in
new
york
county,
that
one
must
use
numbers.
now,
whether
their
constitution
requires
them
to
be
treated
alike
or
differently,
i
come
to
in
a
subsequent
proposition.
mr.
archibald
cox
either
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
actually,
it's
--
what
--
when
i
say
voters,
i
mean
eligible
voters,
citizen
population
which
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
what
he
must
be
talking
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
citizen
--
citizen
population.
i'm
not
sure
which
way
they
define
it
in
new
york
for
purposes
of
my
argument
or
if
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
so.
at
--
in
any
event,
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
citizen
population.
our
second
general
proposition
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
by
an
apportionment
that
is
crazy
quilt
because
it
creates
substantial
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation
without
any
rhyme
or
reason.
this
principle
in
our
view,
as
i'll
--
when
--
i
can't
say
when
i
come
to
explain
it,
invalidates
the
virginia
and
maryland
apportionments.
it's
unimportant
on
one
aspect
of
the
alabama
case.
it
does
not
apply
to
new
york,
at
least
in
the
apportionment
of
the
seats
between
the
counties.
our
third
proposition
is
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not.
i'm
going
to
deal
with
your
honor's
problem
when
i
come
to
explain
each
of
these
and
i
think
i
know
what
you're
thinking
and
i'm
planning
to
meet
it
head
on.
the
third
proposition,
we
assert,
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
by
an
apportionment
that
does
have
some
systematic,
some
intelligible
rule
if
the
criteria
incorporated
in
the
rules
are
either
one
contrary
to
express
constitutional
limitations,
two,
invidious
under
our
traditional
standards
or
three,
irrelevant
to
any
permissible
purpose
of
legislative
apportionment.
specifically,
i
will
argue
that
this
standard
forbids
the
singling
out
of
some
groups
of
voters,
rural
voters,
labor
union
members,
management
or
others
for
preferred
treatment
and
the
others
for
oppressive
treatment.
this
is
the
principle,
we
think,
which
invalidates
the
new
york
apportionment
as
applied
to
the
senate.
and
our
fourth
proposition,
and
we
think
it
has
some
relevance
too
in
the
maryland
and
alabama
cases,
our
fourth
proposition
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
by
an
apportionment
which
subordinates
the
principle
of
popular
representation
to
the
representation
of
political
subdivisions
or
some
other
principle
or
objective
of
representation
to
such
a
degree
as
to
create
gross
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation
and
give
control
of
the
legislature
to
small
minorities
of
the
people.
the
maryland
apportionment,
we
think,
and
two
of
the
apportionments
under
discussion
in
the
alabama
case
are
invalidated
or
invalid
under
that
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
shall.
i'm
going
to
try
to
define
the
obviously
vague
phrase
that
legitimate
or
permissible
purposes
of
a
legislative
apportionment
on
the
principles
(inaudible)
important
as
something
that
tack
all
these
problems
into
it
and
clearly,
each
of
the
things
i've
said
requires
a
great
deal
of
explanation
or
definition.
may
i
note
two
specific
questions
that
we
lay
aside
because
none
of
the
present
cases
raised
them?
none
of
our
four
propositions
espouses
the
view
that
the
concept
of
equal
protection
always
requires
equal
representation
per
capita.
in
other
words,
our
analysis
does
not
assert,
although
it
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
leaves
some
room
for
sacrifice
of
equal
representation
per
capita
in
order
to
achieve
what
i
have
called
to
have
a
short
phrase,
permissible
objectives
of
legislative
apportionment.
indeed,
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
consistency
of
that,
i
may
seem
at
times
to
be
arguing
in
favor
of
these
other
permissible
objectives.
i
do
it
only
arguendo
so
as
to
show
that
it's
genuinely
a
different
problem
and
to
leave
it
for
the
future,
rather
than
have
it
decided
here.
similarly,
though
we
may
want
to
apply
our
generalizations
to
it,
there's
no
question
here
as
to
whether
a
state
may
follow
the
analogy
of
the
federal
government
and
have
one
house
apportioned
by
area
or
political
subdivision
or
provided
the
other
is
apportioned
equally
per
capita
because
none
of
these
cases
involves
a
legislature
in
which
is
of
either
house
is
apportioned
per
capita.
as
i
said
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
talking
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
them
loosely
altogether.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
distinguishing
between
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
if
such
evidence
were
forthcoming,
i
would
think,
requested
here,
but
i
would
think
that
perhaps
one
--
that
was
one
of
the
permissible
purposes
of
legislative
apportionment.
in
fact,
mr.
justice,
all
the
studies
indicate
that
that
is
not
true.
i
--
i
don't
about
new
york.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
i
didn't
mean
--
nor
did
i
mean
to
address
myself
specifically
to
that.
i
meant
that
all
the
information
i
have
been
able
to
get
and
i
have
had
some,
indicates
that
the
rural
voters
voted
larger
numbers
than
the
urban
voters.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
say,
i
would
think
that
if
such
a
consistent
pattern
were
to
be
established,
that
there
would
be
room
for
arguing
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
this
was
a
way
of
getting
the
number
of
representatives
proportionate
to
the
number
of
people
whose
interest
were
to
be
represented,
but
we
don't
have
any
such
a
case.
i
think
that
the
answer
either
way
is
consistent
with
anything
i'm
saying.
it
violates
(inaudible).
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
--
alright,
i
submit
not,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
haven't
yet
asserted
that
you
may
not
have
six
times
the
representation
in
one
district
per
capita
that
you
have
in
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
have
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
indeed,
this
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
all
--
no,
i
literally
meant.
there's
nothing
cut
two-way
in
my
first
proposition.
i
simply
mean
to
say
and
perhaps,
it's
so
simple
that
i
should've
left
it
out,
sometimes
i
think
i
should.
i
simply
mean
to
say
that
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
that
individual
people
or
groups
of
people
shall
be
treated
equally,
unless
there
is
something
to
explain
the
differentiation
that
the
way
you
would
determine
the
first
part
of
that
is
by
per
capita
representation.
then
you
go
on
to
the
unless
part,
is
there
some
justification
for
this
differentiation
and
there
may
be
a
lot
of
them.
that's
what
i
try
to
take
up
in
the
next
three
propositions
of
what
and
i
do
it
by
stating
not
what
differentiations
are
permissible
but
which
ones
are
forbidden,
so
as
to
leave
the
rest
to
the
universe
undecided,
but
i
think
my
standards
are
susceptible
of
general
application.
mr.
archibald
cox
might
--
might
i
postpone
--
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
deal
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that.
might
i
postpone,
i
am
going
to
dealing
with
that,
might
i
just
postpone
in
dealing
with
that
for
just
a
moment.
i'd
--
i'd
--
i
think
that
if
i
can
do
it
with
my
slow
way,
which
it
maybe
a
little
bit
clearer.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
be
flipped,
as
i
say
it,
i
think
my
first
proposition
perhaps,
could
be
skipped
entirely
and
since
we've
only
gone
through
it,
you
won't
be
left
behind.
our
second
proposition
and
the
one
with
which
we
do
come
to
define
when
differentiation
is
impermissible,
is
that
an
apportionment
that
results
in
substantial
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation,
without
rhyme
or
reason,
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
i
think,
is
nothing
more
than
a
--
than
an
application
of
the
long
established
and
familiar
principle
that
equal
protection
clause
precludes
irrational
discrimination
as
between
persons
or
groups
of
persons,
the
application
of
the
law
and
as
the
court
said
in
baker
and
carr,
it's
long
been
open
to
courts
to
invalidate
discriminations
that
are
based
on
no
policy.
that's
the
only
kind
of
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
i'm
addressing
myself
to
now.
by
each
of
these
propositions,
it's
really
quite
limited
by
a
crazy
quilt
or
substantial
inequalities
with
neither
rhyme
nor
reason,
i
apparently
mean
something
different
than
a
number
of
the
appellants
or
appellees
in
these
cases.
if
a
state
has
one
senator
for
each
county,
as
proposed
in
alabama's
67th
senator
amendment
or
one
representative
from
each
town
and
the
lower
houses
in
vermont,
there
are
gross
inequalities
in
the
per
capita
representation,
but
as
i
use
the
words,
those
could
not
be
called
a
crazy
quilt.
they
do
lend
themselves
to
some
intelligible
reason.
similarly,
new
york's
apportionment
of
the
assemblymen
here
is
based
upon
a
combination
of
two
coherent
policies.
one,
that
each
county
should
be
represented,
the
other,
that
the
rest
should
be
distributed
according
to
population.
in
the
senate,
too,
there
is
a
rule.
we
think
it's
more
discriminatory
as
well
as
more
complicated,
but
it
cannot,
the
apportionment
of
senators
among
counties,
cannot
under
our
sense
of
the
term,
be
attacked
as
a
crazy
quilt.
what
do
we
mean
by
a
crazy
quilt?
the
best
example
of
an
apportionment,
lacking
any
intelligible
foundation,
is,
of
course,
baker
and
carr.
among
the
cases
here,
the
prize
example
is
the
apportionment,
in
effect,
in
alabama
at
the
time
the
alabama
case
was
instituted
because
there,
the
seats
were
apportioned
according
to
a
rule
like
new
york's
in
the
1901.
during
the
ensuing
60
years,
there
were
tremendous
changes
in
population
and
one
finds
today
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation
that
no
one
attempts
to
explain,
much
less
to
justify.
you
find
counties
--
the
smaller
county
having
three
senators
and
the
bigger
county
having
two
and
this
sort
of
differentiation
all
over
the
state.
the
virginia
case,
we
submit
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
alabama.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
apportionment
in
effect
in
alabama
when
the
suit
was
started.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
virginia
--
mr.
archibald
cox
new
york
has
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
correct,
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
condemned
by
the
crazy
quilt
rule.
we
do
say
that
alabama
is,
we
say
that
the
virginia
case
is
condemned
by
the
crazy
quilt
rule,
but
it
does
raise
another
question
or
another
problem
in
the
application
of
the
crazy
quilt
rule
to
with
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
want
to
advert
to
that
for
just
a
moment.
the
virginia
senate
is
apportioned
pretty
much
according
to
population,
although
the
state
constitution
doesn't
supply
any
rule.
arlington,
however,
has
only
one
senator
instead
of
the
two
to
which
people
would
be
entitled
under
per
capita
apportionment.
fairfax
and
norfolk
have
only
two
for
the
three
to
which
they
would
be
entitled.
and
in
the
house
of
delegates,
there
is
even
worst
discrimination
measured
by
per
capita
equality
against
those
counties.
so
far
as
we
could
see,
there's
no
explanation
for
this.
no
--
none
of
the
normal
basis
of
apportionment
apply
to
it,
none
other
that
we
can
deserve.
virginia
came
in
and
we
would
say
at
that
state
that
the
plaintiffs
had
carried
their
burden
unless
the
defendants
came
in
and
showed
some
reason,
some
explanation
for
the
apportionment.
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
so
far
as
the
rule
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
you
can
think
of
it
after
the
event,
just
as
--
to
answer
you
more
completely,
all
i'm
saying
now
is
that
if
they
come
in
with
a
reason,
and
i
think
it's
up
to
them
to
come
in
with
the
extraordinary
reason,
that
you're
not
required
to
make
your
case
to
disprove
every
possible
explanation
however
fantastic.
the
courts
never
required
that
even
in
economic
cases.
if
they
do
come
in
and
i
think
they
can
come
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
suppose
--
i
should
suppose
that
if
that's
a
good
reason
and
all
i
said
was
this
--
that
it
might
be
a
good
reason,
we
didn't
have
the
case,
if
they
could
come
in
and
show
that
and
it
would
fit
the
facts,
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
have
that
policy
considered,
yes.
just
as
virginia
comes
in
here
and
says,
"why,
our
policy
is
to
discriminate
in
representation
against
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
their
families,
we
don't
think
they're
worthy
of
being
counted
when
you're
apportioning
a
seat.
"
i
doubt
very
much
whether
that
was
in
the
virginia
legislature's
mind
but
i
suppose
if
they
can
show
that
it
fits
the
fact,
we
can't
psychoanalyze
the
legislature
and
find
out
whether
it
had
it
mind
or
not.
what
we
will
seek
to
show
when
we
come
to
that
case,
is
that
it
doesn't
fit
the
facts
and
it
wouldn't
fit
the
facts,
mr.
justice,
in
your
assumption
about
the
new
york
rural
counties
because
i've
had
a
checkmate.
so
rough,
it's
a
sample
check
and
i
believe
that
it
indicates
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
but
he
was
talking
about
the
number
of
people
who
voted,
not
the
urban-rural.
i
would
say
urban-rural
was
impermissible.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
impermissible.
i've
counted
our
gifts,
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
one
breath
more
and
i
will
be
to
the
determination
of
what's
permissible
and
impermissible.
the
maryland
case
really
introduces
that
problem.
the
maryland
apportionment,
it
seems
to
us,
to
be
a
crazy
quilt
because
there,
the
state
has
given
less
representation
per
capita
to
the
people
of
three
suburban
counties
than
it
gives
to
the
people
of
baltimore
city,
the
urban
center,
or
to
the
rural
counties
and
we
--
we
say
that
there's,
on
the
face
of
it,
no
justification
for
that.
now,
the
state
authorities
come
in
and
say,
"oh,
yes,
there
is
a
justification.
"
they
say
that
baltimore
is
a
port
city
with
shipping
interest.
it's
got
a
steel-making
industry,
iron,
steel
working
industries
and
it's
a
financial
center.
and
we
think
that
the
financial
center
and
the
shipping
industry
and
the
steel
industry
and
the
people
in
connection
with
them
are
more
important
and
so
are
the
farmers
more
important
than
the
people
that
live
in
the
rural
suburbs
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
give
each
of
them
greater
representation.
now,
obviously,
our
case
is
not
complete
unless
we
go
ahead
and
apply
something
in
addition
to
the
crazy
quilt
test.
to
answer
them,
we
have
to
show
that
this
basis
of
differentiation
is
not
permissible.
indeed,
and
i
come
--
i
have
to
direct
myself
to
that
and
i
will
in
just
a
moment,
but
i
want
to
go
just
a
step
further.
indeed,
the
crazy
quilt
test
of
necessity
requires
some
other
test
to
go
with
it,
i
think,
either
by
implication
or
explicitly
because
if
there
is
no
limit
to
the
things
that
a
state
can
take
into
account
in
apportioning
seats
in
the
legislature,
if
it
may
prefer
farmers
over
storekeepers,
bankers
over
wage
earners,
port
cities
over
manufacturing
establishment,
cities
with
a
population,
say,
between
20,000
to
35,000,
over
bigger
cities
or
littler
towns
and
so
forth
and
if
the
rationalization
can
be
supplied
after
the
event,
then
i
suppose
anyone
with
sufficient
time
and
sufficient
imagination
could
supply
some
rule
that
would
explain
the
crazy
quilt.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quite
true,
but
all
i
was
attempting
to
say,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
crazy
quilt
rule
won't
supply
a
complete
answer
to
the
cases
unless
there
are
some
limits
on
what
interest
the
state
may
prefer
over
other
interest.
now,
it's
perfectly
free
so
far
as
anything
i've
yet
said
goes
to
say,
well,
that's
the
trouble
with
the
crazy
quilt
test.
that's
what
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
the
same
thing
in
baker
and
carr
and
all
i
was
saying,
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
disagreement
between
us
at
this
point.
i'm
afraid
my
mind
is
operating
too
slowly
but
i
think
the
foundation
is
important.
i
--
the
next
thing
i
have
to
go
on
and
do,
as
you
suggest,
is
to
deal
with
the
problem,
may
maryland
--
may
maryland,
quite
apart
from
the
other
states,
may
maryland
prefer
the
shipping
interest
over
the
banking
interest,
the
labor
unions
over
management
or
the
reverse
in
manner's
representation?
does
the
constitution
permit
it?
it's
the
critical
question,
isn't
it?
and
it's
that
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
was
attempting
to
direct
myself
to
the
point
that
you
emphasized
earlier
and
that
was
that
we
have
to
have
some
general
rules
here
and
that
we
couldn't
direct
ourselves
just
to
the
particular
case.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
so.
let
me
--
let
me
come
to
my
third
proposition,
let's
see
if
we
can,
in
addition
to
the
crazy
quilt
rule,
formulate
some
others
that
will
answer
the
problem
that
i
used
maryland
to
epitomize.
our
third
proposition
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated
by
discriminatory
apportionment,
and
i
simply
mean
per
capita
differentiation,
based
upon
criteria
that
are
contrary
to
express
constitutional
limitations
or
otherwise
invidious
or
irrelevant
to
any
permissible
purpose
of
legislative
apportionment.
i
have
addressed
myself
to
each
of
those
three,
taking
to
--
beginning
with
the
easiest
case.
certainly,
an
apportionment
based
upon
the
number
of
white
voters
or
white
citizens
in
a
district
or
the
number
of
women
or
the
number
of
men
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it's
contrary
to
the
express
policy
of
the
fifteenth
and
eighteenth
amendments.
similarly,
i
should
suppose
it
was
clear
that
equal
protection
bars
differentiation
and
per
capita
representation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then,
it
doesn't
match.
then
there
would
be
no
inequality.
you
would
apply
my
first
judge
stick,
you
would
find
there
was
no
inequality
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
--
no,
i'm
assuming
when
i
refer
to
women
that
there
is,
for
some
reason,
made
big
difference
between
the
counties,
the
number
of
women
in
one
county
relatively
and
the
number
in
another.
in
that
event,
i
would
think
that
it
violated
the
postulate
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
which
is
that
when
it
comes
to
voting,
that
men
and
women
are
to
be
treated
equally.
and
i
would
think
that
was
a
postulate
that
carried
over
from
voting
to
waiting
their
votes
and
counting
for
--
electing
a
governor
to
apportioning
representatives.
i
suggest
that
invidious
discriminations
were
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
an
apportionment
that
was
based
on
population,
for
example,
but
excluded
roman
catholics
or
persons
of
italian
descent
or
second
generation
immigrants
would
seem
to
me
plainly
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
introducing
a
differentiation
between
people
or
groups
of
people
that
is
quite
contrary
to
our
traditional
heritage
of
equality
in
matters
of
voting.
again,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
purely
whimsical
criteria
will
not
furnish
a
rational
basis
for
differentiation.
for
example,
if
a
state
were
to
apportion
to
each
county
the
number
of
senators
that
there
were
letters
in
the
name
of
the
state
would,
i
think,
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
myself,
in
the
name
of
the
county.
a
long
named
county
would
get
a
lot,
a
short
named
county
would
get
a
few.
excuse
me,
i
--
it
was
simply
a
slip
of
the
tongue
or
suppose
that
the
state
gave
people
who
lived
in
the
western
counties
twice
the
representatives
per
capita
of
those
in
the
east
because
they
lived
nearer
the
setting
sun.
i
take
it
that
that
would
be
a
differentiation
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
exclude
that
and
i
--
these
extreme
examples
i
put
only
because
they
seem
to
me
to
suggest
one
seeks
to
generalize
from
them
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
they
are
impermissible
is
that
they
are
not
relevant
to
any
proper
purpose
of
legislative
apportionment.
in
the
maryland
case,
for
example,
we
say
that
an
apportionment
which
discriminates
against
the
bedroom
towns,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
called
them,
in
favor
of
the
cities
or
in
favor
of
the
rural
areas
is
an
impermissible
apportionment.
in
new
york,
we
say
that
a
discrimination
in
the
senate
against
the
people
who
live
in
counties
having
more
than
6%
of
state's
population,
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
any
county
having
less,
is
based
on
an
impermissible
step.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
well,
i'd
--
and
i'd
say
that
they're
just
as
impermissible
as
discriminating
or
betraying
naturalized
citizens,
other
citizens,
roman
catholics
or
protestants
and
the
like.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
may
do
that
in
some
--
by
some
means
and
not
others.
in
other
words,
mr.
justice,
i
fully
recognize
that
in
enacting
tax
laws
and
regulatory
laws,
granting
appropriations
or
other
benefits
that
a
state
may
encourage
one
industry
or
discourage
another
or
protect
the
wage
earner
or
the
management
and
so
forth.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'd
--
i've
--
i
would
--
i'd
exclude
that.
i
would
say
that
it's
--
and
coming
again
quite
slowly,
that
there's
nothing
novel
in
my
suggestion,
the
basis
of
classification
that
will
do
in
one
area
of
state
action
maybe
impermissible
in
another.
for
example
--
let
me
come
back
to
your
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
address
myself
to.
i
want,
first,
if
i
may,
to
come
to
your
honor's
question
about
encouraging
movement
to
the
west.
i
replied
that
a
state
could
not
give
them
more
representatives
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
move
out
there.
also
it's
quite
clear
that
tax
advantages
and
regulatory
laws
might
be
directed
in
that
direction.
now,
if
i
may,
before
i
come
to
defy,
may
i
simply
suggest
that
there's
nothing
novel
in
the
suggestion
that
discriminations
that
are
permissible
in
one
context
maybe
impermissible
in
another.
i
suppose,
for
example,
that
if
a
state
wished
to
encourage
people
to
go
into
the
steel
industry
that
the
various
tax
benefits
and
other
things
might
do,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
permissible
way
to
encourage
them
to
say
that
no
one
outside
the
steel
industry
may
have
trial
by
jury,
that
only
those
in
the
steel
industry
may
have
trial
by
a
jury.
nor
do
i
think
if
the
aim
is
to
encourage
the
farming
regions
that
a
state
should
say
or
could
constitutionally
say,
"we
won't
supply
education
to
farmers'
children
because
then
they
must
stay
on
the
land
but
we
will
supply
an
education
to
bankers'
children,"
and
there
are
other
cases
which
suggest
that
there
is
room
for
differences
of
this
kind.
in
the
matters
of
apportionment,
i
suggest
that
the
critical
difference
is
between
rules
which
serve
the
purpose
of
making
representative
government
work
better,
the
operation
of
which
may
have
collateral
consequence
of
creating
discriminations
per
capita
and
rules
whose
only
function
is
to
create
classes
of
voters
with
preferred
political
rights,
disproportionate
to
their
number,
which
we
say
is
impermissible.
now,
let
me
explain
first
what
i
mean
by
making
the
legislature
more
representative
and
then
go
to
the
question,
where
do
i
find
the
rule
that
prohibits
creating
the
preferred
classes
of
voters,
just
to
give
one
more
political
right
than
the
other?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
will
--
i
will
try
to
--
by
making
representative
government
work
better,
the
kind
of
thing
to
which
i
suggest
maybe
a
permissible
purpose
of
apportionment.
i
have
it
in
mind
that
a
legislature
is
not
simply
a
mirror
to
public
opinion
like
a
(inaudible).
it's
a
deliberative
body
and
deliberation
requires
knowledge.
for
that
reason,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
might
be
thought
desirable
to
take
steps
to
ensure
that
the
representatives
in
one
house
of
the
legislature
came
from
geographical
districts
small
enough,
so
that
the
--
there
would
be
no
part
of
the
state
which
didn't
have
someone
there
who
knew
its
people
and
their
needs
and
the
individual
conditions
in
the
individual
locality.
an
admirable
example,
i
think
certainly
in
the
past,
would've
been
martha's
vineyard
and
nantucket
gulf
in
massachusetts
coast
where
their
problems
where
distinct
and
they're
ought
to
be
--
could
be
thought
there'd
be
--
ought
to
be
somebody
in
the
legislature
to
know
that.
i've
told
the
red
lake
area
in
minnesota
way
up
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
is
another,
separate
in
area
of
this
kind.
again,
geographically,
small
districts
might
be
sought
to
enable
people
to
know
their
representative
better
and
him
to
know
all
the
people
in
the
district.
it
might
be
thought
that
a
legislature
was
better
informed
and
more
representative
if
it
--
it
this
government
recognized
--
the
apportionment
recognized
the
political
subdivisions
that
have
a
historic
coherence
and
identity
of
their
own.
indeed,
anyone
who's
participated
in
town
or
county
government
knows
that
the
town
hall
or
the
county
courthouse
is
in
a
sense,
say,
nerve
center
for
political
organism
and
that
it
is
more
in
tune
with
the
all
the
county,
all
the
people
in
the
county
than
the
sheer
numbers
might
indicate.
again,
i
suppose
a
measure
of
continuity
or
stability
or
maybe
thought
a
desirable
purpose
in
the
workings
of
the
legislature
or
it
might
be
thought
desirable
to
minimize
the
number
of
political
organizations
that
had
to
be
created
for
representative
districts
so
as
to
have
effective
organization.
this
is
what
i
mean
by
the
permissible
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
indicate
without
defining
precisely
what
i
meant
by
permissive
--
permissible
objectives
of
legislative
apportionment.
and
i
was
suggesting
that
if
--
if
a
state
drew
a
line,
in
a
way
rationally
related
to
one
of
those
permissible
objectives,
then
the
apportionment
would
not
run
afoul
of
either
my
first,
second
or
third
general
principle.
whether
it
runs
afoul
of
the
fourth
principle,
the
one
introducing
a
question
of
degree,
remains
to
be
covered,
but
up
to
this
point,
my
argument
would
not
condemn
any
apportionment
aimed
in
such
a
direction,
having
such
a
function.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
those
rules
are
fundamentally
different
from
differentiations
or
classifications
among
voters
whose
function
is
to
give
the
farmer
more
representation
than
the
city
dweller,
the
shipping
interest,
more
representation
than
the
wage
earner,
the
city
dweller,
more
or
less
than
the
suburbanite
and
so
forth,
or
the
protestant
or
the
jew.
the
latter
kind
--
that
whole
latter
class
when
applied
to
political
rights,
including
representation,
we
say
is
the
very
antithesis
of
the
ideal
of
equality
before
the
law.
now,
i
find
support
for
that
proposition
that
it's
the
antithesis
of
equality
before
the
law,
in
four
places.
in
the
first
place,
i
suggest
that
the
principle
that
their
polity,
the
people
as
a
whole,
knows
no
distinction
in
the
political
worth
of
one
man
as
opposed
to
another,
is
just
as
fundamental
a
strain
in
our
constitutional
parity
as
the
principle
that
it
knows
no
distinction
in
political
matters
between
the
naturalized
citizen
and
the
natural
born
citizen,
according
to
religion
or
according
to
the
red-headed
man
and
the
dark-headed
man
or
the
bald-headed
man.
we
filed
an
elaborate
appendix
to
our
brief
in
the
maryland
case,
in
which
we
show
the
extent
to
which
the
ideas
of
equal
representation
per
capita
was
accepted
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
1789
and
in
the
ratifying
conventions,
as
a
principle
applicable
to
any
government,
dealing
directly
with
its
own
citizens
and
drawing
its
authority
directly
from
the
citizens
in
the
18th
century
philosophy,
as
distinguished
from
a
legislative
body
representing
sovereign
states.
the
practice
in
later
years
fell
somewhat
short
of
the
theory.
indeed,
it
was
short
of
the
professed
ideal
and
at
that
time.
but
nevertheless,
each
stage
in
our
history
has
brought
us
closer
to
wiping
out
the
distinctions
between
one
man
and
another
in
matters
of
his
political
worth.
as
justice
douglas
said,
in
gray
and
sanders,
the
conception
of
a
politically
equality
from
the
declaration
of
independence
to
lincoln's
gettysburg
address
to
the
fifteenth,
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
amendments
can
mean
only
one
thing
and
one
man
--
mr.
archibald
cox
one
vote,
nineteenth,
mr.
justice,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
occasionally,
one
finds
a
political
figure,
praising
the
unique
virtue
of
the
rural
voter
or
defending
the
preferred
power
of
some
special
interest,
but
i
know
of
no
eminent
statesman
or
political
philosopher
who
has
avowed
to
view
that
it
is
proper
to
wait
the
legislature,
so
as
to
assign
to
the
farm
interest,
the
wage
earning
interest,
the
urban
interest
or
any
other
class
or
interest,
a
political
power
disproportioned
to
its
numbers.
that
may
have
done
in
other
countries
but
i
think
no
one
has
ever
urged
that
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
recognize
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recognize
they
are
two
different
subjects,
one
of
my
four
sources,
i'd
be
glad
to
deal
with
now,
is
gray
and
sanders
and
i
submit
that
on
this
point,
gray
and
sanders
is
logically
decisive.
i
see
no
rate
--
if
it
is
impermissible,
if
it
is
contrary
to
our
fundamental
ideal
of
authority
to
give
one
man
more
weight
than
another
or
one
group
more
weight
than
another,
in
choosing
a
governor,
it
would
seem
to
me
it
was
equally
contrary
to
the
notion
of
fundamental
political
authority
to
deliberately
give
one
group
more
weight
than
another
in
choosing
a
legislature.
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
harlan
in
this
respect
was
quite
right
when
he
said
that
there
was
no
difference.
now,
this
does
not,
mr.
justice
stewart,
argue
that
gray
and
sanders
is
decisive
of
this
whole
problem.
it
clearly
isn't
because
legislative
apportionment
serves
functions
that
elections
within
a
single
constituency
do
not
serve,
and
i
was
trying
to
indicate
those
at
the
latter
part
of
my
argument
this
morning,
but
in
terms
of
valuing
a
man
who's
a
wage
earner
more
than
a
man
who's
a
lawyer
or
vice
versa
or
according
to
his
religion
or
anything
else,
in
that
field,
i
see
no
difference.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
holding
that
you
can't
differentiate
between
them
when
it
comes
to
weighting
their
votes,
is
exactly
the
same
that
you
can't
differentiate
between
them
or
exactly
the
same
reason
in
selecting
the
legislature.
now
suppose
for
example,
a
legislature
was
elected
at
large?
now
surely
no
one
would
say
that
you
can
weight
the
votes
giving
wage
earners,
10
votes,
lawyers,
seven
votes,
bankers,
one
vote,
clergymen,
no
votes,
in
electing
the
members
of
the
legislature
at
large.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
now
why,
shouldn't
make
any
sense
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know
the
list
system,
proportional
representation.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
live
out
a
little
town
where
we
just
voted
by
counting
noses.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
you
could
have
proportional
representation,
yes.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
anything
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
an
effort
to
give
some
representation
to
those
who
are
outvoted,
but
not
by
class.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
by
laborers?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
they
vote
by
class,
but
the
legislature
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
may
or
may
not,
but
isn't
phrased
in
terms
of
class.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would've
thought
that
the
rules
applied
when
people
didn't
vote
by
class
just
as
some
of
the
rules
for
permissive
--
some
of
apportionments
for
permissive
purposes,
as
i've
defined
them,
permissible
purposes,
may
result
of
course,
collaterally
in
giving
more
weight
to
the
people
who
live
in
the
rural
areas
than
to
the
people
who
live
in
the
urban
areas.
but
it's
not
phrased
in
those
terms
as
i
understand
it,
the
system
of
proportional
representation
is
not
phrased
in
those
terms
and
it
operates
where
the
people
happen
to
vote
by
class
or
don't
vote
by
class.
it
is
blind
to
classes
of
people
that
we
say
that
fourteenth
amendment,
in
matters
of
representation,
requires
blindness
to
classes
of
people.
now,
i've
mentioned
two
of
the
four
legs
on
which
i
put
this
proposition.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
history
of
the
practice
in
making
state
constitutions
conforms
to
this
proposition.
if
you
examine
the
state
constitutions
of
the
early
ones
and
as
they
are
today,
you
will
find
that
the
central
principle,
the
chief
one,
is
to
base
representation
primarily
on
population,
their
qualifications
and
limitations,
but
if
you
examine
them,
you
will
find
that
they
are
virtually
all
consistent
with
the
basic
distinction
that
i've
been
seeking
to
draw
between
permissible
purposes
as
i
have
defined
them.
the
limitations
are
addressed
with
rare
exceptions,
there
are
some,
new
york
is
one,
to
making
the
legislature
more
representative
in
the
sense
by
avoiding
the
creation
of
excessively
large
district,
by
recognizing
the
coherence
and
independent
identity
and
nerve
center
quality
of
independent
political
subdivision,
by
preserving
a
measure
of
stability
and
things
like
that.
no
state
constitution
so
far
as
i
know
has
ever
espoused
the
view
that
it
is
a
proper
function
of
representation
to
allocate
political
power
to
different
social
economic
classes
out
of
proportion
to
their
number.
very
few
have
provided
for
a
discrimination
against
populous
areas
merely
because
they
are
populous.
there
are
a
few
of
those
and
that
classification,
unless
it
can
be
related
to
something
else,
would
fall
under
my
test.
the
practice
has
been
somewhat
different,
but
i've
never
supposed
that
our
shortcomings
were
the
measure
of
our
constitutional
guarantees.
the
fourth
support
for
my
argument
is
that
it
is
already
claimed
that
in
closely
related
areas,
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
our
third
principle
would
condemn.
no
one
would
argue
that
the
state
may
deny
the
vote
to
bankers
or
wage
earners,
or
lawyers,
or
farmers
on
the
ground
that
it
wants
to
encourage
one
class
or
discourage
another,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
each
must
be
permitted
the
same
opportunity
to
vote.
it
seems
equally
clear
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
to
justice
stewart
that
at
choosing
a
legislature;
you
couldn't
give
10
votes
to
the
banker,
nine
to
the
lawyer,
and
so
on
in
different
proportions
to
different
people
according
to
your
conception
of
their
work.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
that
if
it
could
be
shown
as
in
gamelion
and
(inaudible),
that
the
differentiation
--
that
the
districting
was
drawn
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
bankers,
(voice
overlap)
that
was
the
only
function
it
served,
and
that
was
the
only
function
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
--
i
have
not
yet
suggested
that
any
--
that
a
discrimination
and
per
capita
representation,
it
results
from
the
states
pursuing
some
permissible
practice
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
i'm
coming
--
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
but
i
--
up
to
this
point
have
simply
said
that
you
may
not
create
preferred
classes
of
voters
for
the
sake
of
having
preferred
classes
of
voters
in
those
terms.
now,
if
you're
acting
for
some
other
function,
some
of
these
things
that
i've
suggested
are
permissible,
then
you
have
another
promise
to
which
i
--
i
may
get
today
but
if
not,
i
will
come
to
it
in
the
alabama
case
where
this
is
far
more
squarely
raised.
that's
the
problem
that
by
analysis
this
far
leaves
on
unsolved
which
every
way
one
thinks
it
should
be
solved.
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
gray
and
sanders
in
our
view
was
dispositive
of
this
question
that
it
is
different
from
the
ultimate
question
because
you
may
have
an
apportionment
of
which
is
aimed
at
achieving
some
permissible
function
of
apportionment
whereas
when
you're
conducting
an
election,
you
can't
have
that
kind
of
per
capita
discrimination
result
because
those
functions
don't
apply
to
elections.
let
me
try
to
make
that
point
a
little
clearer
again
by
resorting
to
what
may
seem
a
silly
illustration,
but
i
think
these
silly
illustrations
do
help
us
to
get
general
rules
without
getting
lost
in
numbers.
suppose
that
--
well,
let
me
backup.
it
would
--
the
utterly
whimsical
i
take
it,
at
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
give
the
voters
in
the
western
half
of
the
state
twice
the
representation
per
capita
of
voters
in
the
eastern
half
of
the
state
simply
because
they
live
nearer
the
setting
sun.
it
would
be
equally
impermissible
in
order
to
encourage
the
economic
growth
of
that
half
of
the
state
because
that
is
not
a
proper
function
of
legislative
apportionment.
now,
it
might
be
so
far
as
what
i
have
been
saying
goes
entirely
permissible
for
a
state
to
give
each
county
two
senators
because
her
policy
was
to
represent
counties
and
this
one
might
conclude
and
i
assume
for
the
moment,
it
goes
to
make
the
legislature
work
better
as
a
--
as
a
representative
body.
if
it
happened
that
all
the
counties
with
--
that
were
sparsely
populated
were
in
the
western
half
of
the
state
proving
that
that
was
arithmetically
true
--
proving
that
arithmetically
the
people
who
live
there
had
doubled
the
representation
of
the
people
of
the
eastern
half
being
simply
a
collateral
result
and
not
the
criteria
for
the
differentiation
would
be
in
that
they
didn't
violate
this
third
principle
as
i
have
tried
the
statement.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
if
i
may
to
press
it
with
justice
harlan
asked
just
before
the
recess
and
that
is,
"what
has
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
do
with
this
problem
at
all?
"
it
would
seem
to
me,
first,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
burden
is
on
anyone
who
says
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
apply
because
it
is
general
in
its
language.
it
doesn't
say
everybody's
entitled
to
equal
protection
of
the
law
except
in
voting
or
equal
protection
of
the
law
except
and
that
is
a
representation.
it
says
that
everyone
is
entitled
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
i
don't
suggest
that's
conclusive
but
i
think
it
bears
heavily
and
throws
the
honesty
of
the
word.
second,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
was
implicit
in
the
decision
in
baker
and
carr,
that
the
point
has
really
been
adjudicated
and
i
note
that
connection
that
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
page
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
subsequent
--
which
speaks
for
itself,
i
was
stating
it
conservatively.
i
would
assume
that
it
was
adjudicated.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
happy
--
happy
to
find
your
honor.
the
lower
courts
have
all
thought
that
it
was
clearly
indicated
by
baker
and
carr.
i
know
too
that
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion
assumed
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
--
or
stated
that
it
has
some
application
to
some
of
the
silly
examples
that
i
have
put
earlier.
i
have
put
them
because
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
all
agree
that
the
equal
protection
clause
has
some
application
in
this
field
and
they
really
were
directed
to
that
point
and
finally,
for
reasons
that
i've
stated
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
gray
and
sanders
squarely
resolves
that
proposition.
i
would
like
to
take
the
remaining
moment
to
apply
my
third
principle
to
the
new
york
case.
we
submit
that
the
apportionment
of
the
new
york
legislature
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
the
rule
of
apportionment
in
the
constitution
discriminates
between
the
favored
and
disfavored
classes
of
voters.
on
the
basis
of
criterion
having
--
criteria
having
no
relevance
to
any
permissible
purpose
of
legislative
apportionment.
the
constitution
itself
provides
that
the
per
capita
representation
of
voters
living
in
any
county
was
more
than
6%
of
the
population
shall
be
limited
to
a
fraction,
now
about
60%,
of
the
per
capita
representation
accorded
to
people
who
live
in
a
county
with
less
than
6%
of
the
state's
population.
the
sole
function
of
the
formula,
i
think
it
could
be
shown
without
any
question,
is
to
create
politically
favored,
politically
disfavored
classes
of
voters
classifying
them
according
to
the
number
of
their
neighbors
that
it
lives
here.
now,
the
state
makes
three
arguments
in
this
respect.
first,
they
say
that
there
are
many
matters
of
legislative
concern
that
are
having
importance
to
the
counties
that
are
handled
through
the
counties
and
this
i
am
sure
is
true,
but
this
doesn't
justify
the
rule
in
the
senate.
that's
taken
care
of
by
the
one
representative
from
each
county
in
the
house.
there
is
no
such
purpose
in
the
senate.
there
are
counties
who
don't
have
a
representative.
second,
the
counsel
says
that
the
apportionment
formula
would
limit
the
physical
size
of
a
district
--
the
physical
size
of
the
districts
because
physical
size
may
have
a
significant
bearing
on
a
voter's
capacity
that
influenced
the
legislature.
well,
i
put
it
a
little
differently
but
nevertheless,
i
acknowledged
earlier
that
physical
size
might
be
a
permissible
purpose.
but
the
fault
in
new
york's
argument
is
that
the
formula
for
apportioning
the
senate
has
no
rational
relationship
to
the
goal
of
keeping
down
the
size
of
the
district.
there's
nothing
in
the
formula
that
limits
the
geographical
size
of
any
district.
there
are
states
that
do
that
and
i
couldn't
make
this
argument
with
respect
to
them.
california
is
one,
kentucky
is
another
and
perhaps
there
are
more.
the
purpose
of
having
somebody
from
every
area
is
again
served
by
the
apportionment
of
the
assembly.
in
addition,
it
can
be
shown
that
the
rule
that
says
that
once
a
county
grows
and
what's
that
first
ratio
county
has
more
representatives
than
in
1894,
those
seats
are
assigned
to
the
less
populous
or
second
ratio
of
counties
is
permanent
even
though
the
total
number
of
first
ratio
seats
diminishes.
so
that
you
have
a
point
of
fact,
a
greater
number
of
second
ratio
seats
available
today
than
you
had
in
1894
and
if
my
calculations
are
right,
they're
available
for
a
smaller
area,
so
that
this
really
can't
be
a
direct.
it
doesn't
have
any
tendency
to
keep
down
the
geographical
size
of
district.
in
addition,
if
one
examines
the
workings
of
this,
he
will
find
that
what
has
been
happening
is
that
as
the
constitution
would
permit,
the
geographical
size
of
districts
in
new
york
has
in
fact
been
increased.
the
people
who
have
benefited
are
the
counties
that
are
getting
two
or
more
senators,
but
not
enough
to
put
them
into
first
ratio
the
more
populous
county
category.
the
rural
areas
are
getting
bigger.
the
top
three
counties
is
now
one
senatorial
district.
in
1894,
it
was
two.
it
is
now
a
senatorial
district
that
reaches
from
the
lake
down
to
the
pennsylvania
line.
that
used
to
be
divided.
i
got
a
list
of
the
others
that
can
be
made
out.
so
that
this
rule,
we
say,
does
not
tend
to
achieve
either
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
geographical
size
of

small
or
any
other
permissible
purpose.
it
is
simply
a
classifying
legislation
aimed
to
give
the
rural
voter
more
votes
and
our
second
principle,

think
forbids
that.
the
third
argument
is
that
new
york
must
take
into
account,
the
unique
concentration
of
population
of
political
power
in
a
few
localities
in
order
to
assure
that
the
wishes
and
needs
of
the
rest
of
the
state
will
not
be
ignored.
