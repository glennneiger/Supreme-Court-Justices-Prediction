justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
madison,
do
you
see
--
you
suggested
that
there
is
nothing
here
on
the
merits
at
all
that
the
--
this
case
would
dispose
up
on
a
procedural
matter
below
and
so
there's
nothing
here
to
be
decided
on
the
merits.
i
wish
you
had
look
at
--
at
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
your
court,
the
supreme
court
if
it
said,
that's
on
page
6a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
says
that
assignments
of
error
2,
3,
4,
8
and
17
are
argued
together
but
then
it
says
numbers
2,
3
and
4
carrier
--
charge
error
in
that
the
judgment
and
decree
are
contrary
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
contrary
to
law
and
contrary
to
the
evidence.
and
they
say,
"we
have
held
that
this
type
of
assignment
is
without
merit
and
presents
nothing
for
review."
now,
is
that
a
statement
that
--
that
we
just
don't
review
evidentiary
matters
in
this
court,
we
only
review
matters
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
was
wrong
with
those
assignments
of
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
some
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
said
that
we
will
not
review
any
evidentiary
matters
in
this
court,
is
that
right?
that's
why
what
that
--
what's
wrong
with
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what's
wrong
with
an
assignment
which
says
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence?
now,
what's
wrong
--
why
won't
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
accept
that
assignment
and
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
time
which
they
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
consider.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
that
--
so
the
matters
as
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
are
not
reviewable
in
that
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
wrong
with
the
raising
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
this
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
and
they
say
it's
improper
or
they
won't
consider
it.
this
is
one
of
the
errors
which
supposedly
is
--
was
--
is
improperly
stated
and
it
--
and
therefore,
it
infects
all
the
rest
of
there
that
is
argued
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
--
what
was
wrong
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
says
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
this
type
of
assignment
of
error
is
without
merit
and
presents
nothing
for
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
am
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'm
going
to
get
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
review
something
on
--
review
the
evidence
and
certainly,
it
has
the
evidence
support
of
verdict
or
support
the
judgment
and
i
make
that
assignment,
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
apparently
--
i
--
i
can
get
no
farther
with
it,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
that's
the
matter
for
the
trial
court.
we
don't
review
assignments
of
error
like
that,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
--
court
doesn't
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
they
say.
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
passed
on
a
--
on
a
matter
which
--
which
the
petitioners
have
now
brought
here
for
review,
namely,
they
are
saying
that
there
--
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
support
the
--
to
support
the
judgment
below.
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
"well,
we
just
won't
even
go
into
that
because
we
don't
consider
things
like
that
in
this
court.
we
just
don't
consider
value
and
matters
like
that."
at
least
it
--
it
disposed
to
this
assignment
of
error.
the
assignment
of
error
was
that
the
decree
is
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
contrary
to
the
evidence
in
the
law
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
says
this
--
this
assignment
is
without
merit.
now,
what's
more
--
how
much
more
ruling
can
you
have
under
the
time
of
the
merit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
disposed
of
the
assignment
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
the
evidence
can
be
(inaudible)
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has,
by
disposing
the
assignment
of
error,
given
no
consideration
whatsoever
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
have
to
--
all
we
have
to
--
there's
no
--
even
if
you
--
even
if
it
were
accepted
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
doesn't
need
to
consider
assignment
3
because
assignment
2
is
no
good.
if,
nevertheless,
the
plaintiffs'
assignment
2
is
no
good
has
passed
upon
it,
that
is
something
that
has
been
passed
upon
and
that
happens
to
be
the
precise
issue,
one
of
the
concise
issue
that's
brought
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
my
point
was
--
didn't
go
to
the
saying
at
all
with
taking
any
judgment
because
all
the
merits
were
here.
i
was
trying
to
find
out
if
any
of
the
merits
were
here
and
one
of
the
point
is
that
--
is
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
judgment.
it
seems
to
me
that
either
that
issue
was
here
either
because
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
passed
on
it
or
because
they
refused
to
pass
on
it
and
therefore,
we
review
that
issue
as
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
circuit
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
one
of
the
issues
i
must
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
would
--
i
certainly
would
welcome
any
other
explanation
for
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
meant,
when
it
said
that
--
that
these
assignments
of
error
2,
3
and
4
are
without
merit
and
are
not
proper
assignments
of
error,
what
did
it
mean
by
--
by
that?
this
was
--
this
was
his
excuse,
for
example,
for
--
for
not
going
on
to
consider
error
17
because
they
found
2,
3
and
4,
with
which
17
was
argued.
they
found
2,
3
and
4
were
without
merits,
and
therefore,
they
shouldn't
consider
17.
now,
what
did
it
mean
by
2,
3
and
4
without
merits?
that
--
that's
certainly
a
judgment
upon
the
--
upon
the
assignment
of
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that's
--
the
argument
was
that
2,
3
and
4
are
no
good
and
therefore,
they
can't
consider
17.
that's
what
they
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
face
--
on
the
face
of
it,
it
would
seem
they're
saying
that
although
the
--
the
--
an
assignment
is
made
if
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient.
we
either
say
it
was
or
we
won't
even
consider
it
and
saying
one
of
the
two
things
that
have
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
carter,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
alabama
rule
at
the
court
below
ap
--
applied,
was
it
valid,
acceptable
--
acceptable
state
grounds
for
doing
what
it
is,
then
what
matters
are
here
on
the
merits?
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
fully
the
--
the
proposition
that
the
--
that
the
rule
below
that
--
quite
a
proper
rule
and
insulates
something
anyway
from
review
here.is
there
anything
left
there
for
review
here
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
trouble
is
--
of
course
the
trouble
with
my
point
on
the
specific
ones
i
raised
was
it
--
was
it
within
those
assignments
of
error,
no
federal
question
was
raised.
it's
true
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
assignment
didn't
say
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
--
and
the
supreme
court
perhaps
passed
on
the
merits
of
that
--
that
point.
but
it
didn't
have
to
construe
them
in
federal
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
reviewable
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
that
--
it
just
doesn't
have
to
be
worded
that
way.that's
all,
that
assignment
of
error.
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
certainly
--
there
was
another
assignment
of
error
raised
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
normally,
you
don't
raise
thompson
--
the
thompson
point
by
saying
that
he
--
the
judgment
is
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
well,
let's
assume
that
--
assume
then
that
the
thompson
point
is
here
because
they
passed
on
the
--
on
the
merits
of
those
particular
times.
what
other
point
is
here,
assuming
that
the
alabama
rule
is
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
mean
to
really
take
up
your
time
mr.
carter,
you
got
--
you
go
ahead,
i
mean.
