mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
this
cause
is
here
for
the
fourth
time
and
what
petitioner
hopes
at
the
final
time.
on
this
occasion,
the
petitioner
seeks
to
have
a
review
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
refused
to
decide
on
the
merits,
the
validity
of
an
injunction,
a
permanent
injunction
issued
against
the
petitioner
which
in
effect
ousted
it
from
the
state.
we're
also
seeking
and
asking
this
court
to
decide
this
controversy
on
the
merits
because
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
--
the
claims
that
petitioner
is
making
and
the
protracted
nature
of
the
cause
itself,
we
think
that
the
issue
ought
to
be
settled
and
settled
final.
the
cause
began
in
june
1,
1956
with
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
injunction
by
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
in
alabama
which
barred
the
petitioner
from
operating,
functioning
or
soliciting
memberships
in
the
state
on
--
on
--
by
virtue
of
a
complaint
which
had
been
filed
by
the
attorney
general.
the
injunction
was
issued
without
notice
and
without
hearing,
as
far
as
petitioner
was
concerned.
and
the
injunction
not
only
barred
and
ousted
the
petitioner
from
the
state
but
barred
it
from
attempting
to
comply
with
the
statutes
of
alabama
which
purportedly
were
the
basis
upon
which
the
complaint
had
been
issued.
the
burden
of
the
complaint,
the
original
complaint
which
was
filed,
was
that
petitioner
was
doing
business
and
operating
in
alabama
without
--
as
a
foreign
corporation
without
registering.
and
that
--
in
essence,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
complaint
really
alleged
that
petitioner
was
in
the
business
of
--
of
doing
things
for
--
in
the
field
of
race
relations,
two
of
which
were
named,
one,
the
support
of
the
admission
of
authurine
lucy
to
the
university
of
alabama
and
the
other,
the
support
of
a
boycott
of
the
buses
in
--
by
negroes
in
montgomery
on
the
--
to
attempt
to
have
equal
treatment
for
negroes.
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
business
of
race
relations
and
that
this
was
--
was
constituting
irreparable
injury
to
alabama
because
it
had
not
registered.
the
first
occasion
on
which
this
cause
reached
here
was
on
a
collateral
matter,
on
the
issue
of
--
of
a
contempt.
at
that
point,
the
state
ordered
the
petitioner
to
produce
various
things
including
the
--
the
names
and
addresses
of
its
members,
petitioner
refused
with
the
judge
in
contempt,
the
cause
reached
here,
this
court
reversed
in
a
decision
which
was
handed
down
in
june
of
1958.
cause
came
here
a
second
time.
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
june
of
1959,
when
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
reaffirmed
the
judgment
below,
the
judgment
of
contempt
on
the
grounds
that
although
petitioner
could
not
be
held
to
be
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
produce
his
membership
list,
it
had
not
complied
with
other
portions
of
the
order.
this
court
held
that
the
matter
had
been
adjudicated
and
presented
here
as
if
the
only
question
before
the
court
was
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
petitioner's
refusal
to
give
up
its
membership
list
and
that
having
considered
that,
that
the
question,
the
alabama
court
could
not,
therefore,
affirm
on
the
grounds
that
there
were
other
portions
of
the
order
which
had
not
been
complied
with.
the
alabama
supreme
court
on
the
second
remand
of
this
cause,
held
the
cause
without
sending
it
down
to
the
lower
court
for
trial.
so
the
petitioner
was
frustrated
in
its
attempt
to
secure
a
trial.
and
in
june
of
1960,
petitioner's
sought
to
have
a
trial
of
the
issue
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
that
cause
reached
here
in
the
october
term
1961
and
that
time
the
--
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
writ
certiorari
and
ordered
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
instruct
the
district
court
to
proceed
with
the
trial
of
this
cause
unless
a
trial
on
the
merits
have
been
accorded
by
the
petitioner
by
june
--
january
the
2nd,
1962.
the
circuit
court,
thereupon,
granted
petitioner
a
hearing
on
the
merits
in
december
1961.
when
the
hearing
was
concluded
on
december
the
29th,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
made
permanent.
in
fact,
there
are
some
minor
deviations
but
the
substance
was
the
same.
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
supreme
court
of
alabama
took
the
view
that
petitioner
had
not
complied
with
one
of
its
rules
of
procedure
that
its
argument
section
of
its
brief
--
brief
was
so
at
variance
with
alabama's
procedure
that
it
could
not
review
the
matter
on
the
merits
because
various
assignments
of
errors
which
were
not
related
had
been
argued
together
and
therefore,
under
--
under
the
alabama
rules,
that
they
argued
together
and
one
is
without
merit.
the
supreme
court
indicated
that
it
would
not
consider
any
of
the
assignments
of
error
alleged
and
therefore,
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
circuit
court
nearly
issued
a
decree.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
indicated
that
it
would
write
an
opinion
later
but
it
never
--
never
took
that
opportunity.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
only
finding
that
i
would
think
that
the
court
could
say
was
made
was
that
it
indicated
that
the
--
that
the
charges
had
been
proved
by
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
now,
we
take
the
view
here
that
the
alabama's
procedural
ground
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
mistaken.
one,
we
think
that
the
deviations
from
the
procedure
that
it
now
seeks
to
bar
review
on
the
merits
of
the
petitioner,
but
deviations
are
such
in
alabama
procedure
that
we
think
that
we
can
say
to
the
court
with
confidence
that
the
parties
from
this
are
really
a
regular
part
of
alabama
procedure.
in
other
words,
that
all
the
alabama
says
that
rule
9
must
be
complied
with
which
it
relied
on
here
to
dismiss
the
--
the
brief
without
cause,
without
breaching
the
merits.
it
has
held
in
case
after
case,
that
even
though
the
rules
are
not
complied
with,
that
the
rules
are
merely
directory,
that
they
are
not
jurisdictional
and
that
the
court
will
go
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
and
we
have
cited
both
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
a
large
number
of
cases
which
--
in
which
alabama
has
done
this
--
this
--
it
has
followed
this
practice
in
many,
many
cases,
so
that
our
--
our
first
point
that
this
can't
obtain
is
the
fact
that
we
think
the
regular
procedure
of
alabama
is
in
fact
to
go
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
even
--
even
assuming
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
rules.
we
also
urge
the
court
that
the
--
the
basis
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
refused
to
go
to
the
merits
of
this
cause
is
a
really
a
triviality.
it's
at
best
a
practice
which
is
outmoded
and
a
ritual.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
with
all
of
the
many
times
that
this
case
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
that
the
brief
and
the
cause
itself,
the
court
was
--
was
reasonably
familiar
with
what
the
issues
were
and
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
it
did
not
know
what
petitioner
was
attempting
to
press.
so
the
--
our
theory
is
that
under
the
rules
of
this
court
that
the
basis
upon
which
alabama
sought
to
bar
review
by
this
court
cannot
be
sustained.
we
think,
therefore,
that
the
cause
is
here
on
the
merits.
and
we
will
now
address
our
--
we'll
now
address
myself
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
which
i
think
--
we
think
is
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
the
basis
upon
which
it
--
it
dismissed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
the
state
in
the
--
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
state
did
not
raise
the
issue
that
we
had
not
complied
with
the
rules
and
in
the
argument
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
no
question
was
raised
by
--
by
that
court
in
the
oral
argument,
that
there
had
been
a
departure
from
the
rules
of
the
court.
it
was
only
in
the
opinion,
when
the
written
opinion
that
they
came
down
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
we,
insofar
as
petitioner's
contention
is
in
--
in
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
cause,
we
think
that
there
is
no
evidentiary
basis
in
this
record
upon
which
the
judgment
and
decree
ousting
petitioner
from
the
state
of
alabama
could
--
could
possibly
be
sustained.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
or
three
grounds
which
the
--
which
had
been
alleged,
which
may
arguably
have
a
basis.
the
first
ground
is
that
we
did
not
comply
with
the
foreign
registration
statute.
we
concede
that
we
did
not.
the
other
grounds
are
that
--
that
they
have
alleged
and
the
only
allegations
that
have
been
made
is
one
that
petitioner
assisted
an
individual,
authurine
lucy,
in
legal
counsel
to
attempt
to
secure
her
admission
to
the
university
of
alabama,
we
would
think
that
that
would
be
foreclosed
as
a
basis
for
ouster
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
naacp
versus
button.
the
question
of
our
assistance
to
martin
luther
king
and
the
negroes
in
--
in
montgomery,
alabama
in
their
attempt
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
the
bus
company
to
secure
the
end
of
discrimination
in
the
seating
and
arrangements
on
the
buses,
we
think
that
one,
that
this
court
has
held
in
browder
versus
gayle
on
--
on
the
same
issue
that
segregation
in
intrastate
commerce
assort
to
--
to
a
state
law
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we
think
that
even
assuming,
that
the
--
there
is
any
basis
in
that.
the
--
dr.
king
was
convicted
of
the
charge
under
state
law
and
the
--
his
conviction
was
affirmed.
but
our
contention
is
that
the
giving
of
moral
support,
legal
counsel
cannot
be
a
basis
upon
which
the
--
the
state
of
alabama
can
justify
an
ouster.
in
their
amended
complaint,
which
i
think
is
on
pages
14
and
15,
the
state
sets
forth
a
number
of
grounds
alleging
that
petitioner
made
various
false
charges
against
state
officials
including
the
judiciary.
and
whatever
arguable
merit
that
might
have,
we
think
that
has
been
stripped
away
by
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
times
company
versus
sullivan.
so
that
some
of
the
charges
that
the
--
that
were
alleged,
there
was
no
or
even
attempt
to
introduce
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
approve
them.
the
two
basic
charges
i
suppose,
which
are
left
and
the
two
basic
grounds
are
that
the
petitioner
violated
the
injunction,
that
is
that
the
--
there
is
no
injunction.
and
although
i
don't
even
see
how
that,
a
proof
which
we
contend
has
not
been
proved
but
even
proof
of
a
violation
of
the
original
injunction,
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
utilized
to
support
the
validity
of
the
original
injunction
in
the
first
instance.
the
second
ground
is,
of
course,
as
we
say
are
--
are
our
failure
to
register.
now,
let
me
take
the
first
one.
the
state,
in
the
course
of
the
testimony,
its
theory
apparently
was
that
the
petitioner
was
operating
in
alabama
under
another
name.
there
was
another
organization
with
the
name
association
in
it
and
the
--
the
state
took
the
view
that
we
were
operating
in
alabama
that
we
were
the
same
as
this
organization.
but
i
think
the
court
will
agree
that
in
each
and
every
instance
and
all
the
witnesses
that
were
brought,
that
this
charge
was
completely
refuted
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
brought
by
the
--
by
the
--
the
state
on
its
own
of
any
kind
which
indicates
that
this
is
so.
all
the
evidence,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
to
the
contrary.
every
witness
testified
that,
with
the
injunction
issued
as
of
june
1,
1956,
that
petitioner
ceased
operation
and
closed
its
--
its
offices
and
disbanded
its
branches
and
was
no
longer
functioning
in
the
state
that
the
people
who
are
in
its
paid
staff
were
--
were
put
on
terminal
pay,
were
either
transferred
or
--
or
placed
in
some
other
functioned.
and
there
is
no
evidence
here
to
show
that
we
have
violated
the
injunction
in
any
--
any
degree.
now,
we
contend
that
the
registration
statute,
which
we
concede
that
we
did
not
follow,
is
a
venue
on
service
of
process
statute
only.
we
think
that,
as
we
attempt
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
and
the
purpose
under
the
law
of
--
of
alabama,
is
to
make
foreign
corporations
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
state.
so
that
in
any
controversy
which
occurs
between
the
foreign
corporation
and
alabama
citizens,
that
the
alabama
citizens
will
not
be
without
a
remedy.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
--
i,
under
ordinary
circumstances,
i
would
say,
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
after
looking
at
the
--
the
history
of
this
case
and
the
erection
of
procedural
barriers
to
reaching
the
merits
of
this
cause,
it
seems
to
me
that
since
alabama
--
since
there
is
no
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
reading
the
record,
there
was
no
attempt
in
the
record
to
show
--
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
need,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
show
that
we
have
not
complied
with
the
registration
statute
because
of
the
--
we
--
we
have
--
we
admitted
that
in
june
of
1956.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
there
has
been
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
by
the
--
by
the
lower
court
and
this
--
then
supreme
court
of
alabama,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
that
by
virtue
of
its
past
history
in
this
will
never
have
been
reached
adjudication
on
the
merits,
it
always
sought
to
avoid
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
principally,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
for
the
reason
that
there
is
nothing
on
the
merits
upon
which
this
--
the
validity
of
this
injunction
can
be
sustained.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
--
can
say
on
this
is
that
the
only
basis
upon
which
alabama
--
alabama
--
that
this
complaint
can
be
utilized
or
sustained
is
the
fact
that
we
have
not
complied
with
the
statute.
we're
suggesting,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
in
the
statute,
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
authorizing
ouster
that
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
of
which
has
been
setout
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
accords
to
the
solicitor
general
a
--
to
solicitor
of
the
various
counties,
the
right
to
proceed
against
persons
who
don't
comply
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
the
statute
does
do
is
to
--
for
persons
who
do
not
comply
or
organizations
who
do
not
comply,
it
sets
forth
a
specific
penalty
of
$1000
and
it
seems
to
that
sort.
we
do
think
that
having
come
into
this
case,
having
used
equity,
utilizing
an
injunction
under
the
circumstances
of
the
--
of
this
case,
in
the
use
of
this
to
--
to
oust
us
from
the
state
that
this
--
this
does
rise,
in
itself,
a
due
process
question
which
we
think
has
been
violated.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
remedy
available
to
alabama
if
--
if
alabama
wants
to
utilize
it.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
it
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
bar
the
petitioner
from
coming
into
the
state
and
i
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
this
has
really
amounted
to
in
effect,
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
and
his
members'
rights
the
freedom
of
association
and
rights
of
--
other
rights
of
the
first
amendment
which
have
been
protected.
we
think
that
what
alabama
is
doing
or
has
attempted
to
do
with
this
injunction
is
the
very
thing
that
this
court
has
held
that
could
not
be
done
by
virginia
in
--
in
a
construction
of
a
barrier
statute
that
the
court
had
held
could
not
be
done
by
florida
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
an
investigation
of
--
by
legislative
committee
that
the
court
has
held
could
not
be
done
on
the
grounds
of
attempting
to
raise
a
revenue
in
arkansas
in
bates
versus
little
rock
or
the
application
of
a
statute
which
had
been
passed
to
suppress
the
illegal
organizations
in
louisiana
versus
naacp.
we
think
that
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
court
--
that
the
--
alabama
is
--
is
attempting
to
do
indirectly
what
it
cannot
do
directly
and
that
what
it
also
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
bar
a
review
by
this
court
on
the
merits,
by
reaching
decisions
on
procedural
grounds.
in
our
view
of,
and
i
would
indicate
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
this
state
action
that
the
injunction
has
no
validity,
that
it
does
--
it
is
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights
that
the
use
of
this
procedure
is
a
violation
of
due
process
insofar
as
petitioner
is
concerned
and
that
unless
this
court
in
this
case
is
prepared,
if
the
court
agrees
that
the
injunction
on
this
record
has
no
validity,
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
issue
a
detailed
decree
which
will
afford
petitioner
relief
in
the
right
to
operate
in
the
state
of
alabama,
to
resume
operation
in
the
state
of
alabama
without
the
necessity
of
the
implementation
of
that
decree
by
the
alabama
court,
we
think
that
we
are
not
mistaken
to
suggest
that
on
the
basis
of
the
history
of
this
case,
that
this
cause
will
be
here
for
the
fifth
time
without
its
final
resolution.
it's
for
that
reason
we
are
urging
the
court
to
review
the
record,
the
evidence
and
make
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
to
issue
a
detailed
decree
which
would
give
support
and
protection
to
the
right
of
petitioner
to
function
and
operate
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
it
reversed
and
remanded
this
cause
with
--
with
the
direction
to
--
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
i
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
this
would
be
sufficient
to
give
the
--
the
petitioner
protection
and
to
allow
petitioner
to
operate
in
the
state.
for
example,
the
first
time
the
cause
was
here,
it
was
reversed
and
sent
back.
we
urged
at
that
time
that
the
--
for
the
court
to
reach
the
merits,
the
court
said
the
merits
were
not
here
within
a
collateral
matter
but
now
having
settled
the
collateral
matter,
the
court
said,
"we
think
that
the
alabama
will
proceed
to
grant
you
a
hearing
on
the
merits."
alabama
did
not
do
that.
the
alabama
held
the
decree
and
it's
attempted
to
erect
another
barrier
which
this
court
--
it
does
for
the
second
time
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
--
let
me
merely
say
this
that
if
--
if
maybe
the
word
is
--
the
better
word
is
explicit
because
what
i
really
am
trying
to
say
to
the
court
is
that
merely
a
--
if
we
have
to
move
and
operate
on
the
mandate
of
this
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
dissented
mandate
down
based
upon
this
--
this
court's
decision
that
we
will,
in
terms
of
it
being
effectuated
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
not
send
its
mandate
down
from
this
court
from
--
from
--
some
--
from
august
1
of
1958
until
after
we
had
gone
into
the
federal
court
at
the
--
in
july
of
1960
--
1961.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
want
--
i
would
suggest
that
the
decree
would
say
that
--
that
the
--
to
vacate
the
injunction
--
that
the
injunction
has
been
issued
and
it's
--
and
it's
void
and
that
pursuant
to
the
decision
of
this
court
that
the
petitioner
--
that
there
is
no
authority
to
bar
petitioner
from
functioning
in
alabama
and
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
file
papers,
registration
papers
with
the
supreme
--
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
alabama
and
to
proceed
operations
and
function
--
and
functioning
in
the
state
without
barriers
by
the
--
by
the
state
authorities.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i
don't
recall
in
any
situation
where
the
court
has
done
this
specifically
but
i'm
requesting
this
extraordinary,
what
i
think
would
be
an
extraordinary
relief
because
of
the
nature
of
the
problem.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
--
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
i
--
i
am
--
i
--
i
know
--
i'm
suggesting
this
form
of
relief,
if
the
court
please,
because
i
--
this
will
be
in
june
of
this
year
that's
--
well,
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
for
eight
years
and
i
--
i
think
that
unless
the
court
acts
to
this
extent
or
to
some
extent
that
we
will
--
it
will
not
come
to
a
final
conclusion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
when
the
case
was
up
here
last
time,
this
court
ordered
the
--
a
hearing
by
the
state
court.
and
if
there
were
no
hearing
by
the
state
courts
by
no
later
than
january
2nd,
the
federal
court
want
to
proceed
plus
the
fact
that
the
federal
court
was
ordered
to
maintain
supervision
to
keep
in
touch
with
what
was
going
on.
when
the
hearing
was
granted
in
the
state
court,
we
proceeded
to
give
to
the
federal
court
a
monthly,
at
its
request,
monthly
reports
of
the
status
of
the
case.
when
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
refused
to
--
to
hear
this
case
on
the
merits
or
dismiss
the
case
without
going
to
the
merits,
we
then
went
before
the
district
court
with
a
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
under
the
--
under
the
order
of
this
court
and
in
view
of
the
manner
in
which
the
case
had
gone,
that
the
district
court
now
should
proceed
to
a
hearing
and
to
a
disposition
of
the
cause.
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
what
it
would
be
doing
with
the
reviewing
the
--
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
we
filed
--
and
that
the
only
court
that
could
do
this
was
this
court.we
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
we
filed
an
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
with
a
--
with
a
request
that
it
stay
proceeding.
they're
appending
the
decision
by
this
court
on
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
all
of
these
--
we
recited
all
of
these
facts,
if
i'm
not
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
our
brief.
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
are
now
--
now
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we've
asked
that
that
be
done.
yes,
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
let
me
--
yes,
i
--
i
--
what
we
--
we
didn't
know
whether
we
--
in
terms
of
our
own
way
to
go
we
didn't
know
which
way
to
go
and
we
--
we
thought
that
we
had
to
go
before
the
--
the
united
states
district
court
prior
to
the,
you
know,
in
terms
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
whether
it
would
grant
the
petition.
and
when
it
dismissed
without
it,
we,
therefore,
had
to
file
our
notice
of
appeal
in
order
to
keep
the
action
alive.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
so
that
what
we
--
yes,
sir.
so
that
what
we
--
the
answer
is
yes
that
the
--
the
proceedings
are
--
are
still
alive
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
have
just
a
few
remarks
if
i
may
and
i'd
like
to
say
this
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
question
about
title
10.
but
i
should
have
in
answer
to
your
question
about
its
construction
indicated
to
you
that
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
alabama
has
already
construed
the
statute
in
the
way
that
we
suggest.
this
is
in
(inaudible)
versus
cleveland
motor
company
case
which
it
has
given
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
is
merely
a
genuine
--
at
least
genuine
service
of
process
statute.
the
motion
for
rehearing
which
is
set
out
on
page
213
as
all
of
the
assignment
of
errors
really
or
assignments
of
errors
are
in
fact
the
restatement
of
the
--
all
the
allegations
which
have
set
--
set
or
which
have
been
set
out
there.
and
the
question
to
mr.
justice
black
asked
about
the
application
of
the
rules
as
to
whether
they
were
discretionary.
we
have
set
out
in
--
in
our
main
brief
at
page
29,
a
list
of
cases
which
we
think
will
support
our
--
our
contention
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
these
rules
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
does
indicate
that
that
the
rules
have
not
been
complied
with
--
that
they
will
go
through
the
merits
anyway.
one
point
i'll
finally
--
the
record
of
--
the
entire
record
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
clerk's
office
and
that
insofar
as
the
attorney
general's
office
is
concerned
that
in
our
brief,
we
argue,
our
brief
was
devoted
almost
entirely
to
the
merits
of
this
cause.
we
filed
our
brief
here
first
and
we
would
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
if
there
was
concern
in
the
attorney
general
about
meeting
the
argument
on
--
on
the
merits,
that
they
had
the
opportunity
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that
the
--
all
of
the
--
i
would
say
first
that
all
of
the
assignment
of
errors,
we
have
filed
the
assignments
of
error,
we
made
them
a
part
of
our
motion
for
rehearing
and
therefore
presented
them
to
the
court
below
and
the
court
below
disposed
of
them
in
trial
court.
we
made
and
put
them
in
a
form
of
assignments
of
error
and
presented
them
to
the
--
to
the
court
of
--
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
the
--
now,
i
would
say
that
all
of
them
--
but
certainly,
where
the
court
indicates
that
the
assignment
that
we
have
made
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
which
is
the
questions
that
you
were
addressing
to
mr.
madison
and
indicates
that
these
are
without
merits.
i
think
that
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
those
have
to
be
here
because
merit
must
mean
merit.
i
don't
know
what
it
means
other
than
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
think
your
--
your
honor
that
--
doesn't
that
bring
us
into
the
case
of
thompson
versus
louisville?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
--
but
if
we
argue
--
we
say
that
the
decree
below
is
--
is
not
accorded
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
and
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
you
find
that
it's
not.
it
seems
to
--
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
--
under
the
doctrine
of
thompson
versus
louisville
and
wright
versus
georgia,
i
think
this
court
--
this
--
this
is
a
due
process
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
ground
upon
which
the
decree
could
be
sustained.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
what
we
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
no.
that
--
that's
true
but
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
we
raised
it,
the
court
held
and
--
and
apparently
indicated
that
--
that
by
denying
it
on
the
merits
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence.
now,
i
would
think
that
under
the
long
standing
doctrine
here
where
the
court
is
able
to
make
its
own
independent
examination
of
the
error
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
just
give
me
one
--
about
two
minutes
and
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
i
would
think
in
my
own
open
argument
in
regard
to
it
is
that
--
is
that
as
a
matter
of
--
of
fact,
i
would
think
that
all
of
the
assignments
would
be
here
even
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
decree
is
--
that
the
rule
of
--
of
alabama
is
valid.
because
as
a
--
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
did
discuss
in
our
--
in
our
brief
on
the
merit,
each
and
every
one
of
the
assignments
except
one.
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
alabama
has
said
because
you
have
argued
this
--
you
have
argued
one
together
--
ones
without
the
merit
and
therefore,
we
won't
--
we
won't
consider
any
of
them.
but
i
suppose
what
i'm
really
doing
is,
i'm
going
now
to
attack
the
rule
which
is
not
really
the
question
that
you
asked.
the
problem
of
course
that
we
have
with
this
is
that
apparently,
we
raised
23
assignments
of
errors
and
as
we
made
23
points,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
would've
held
that
we
were
within
the
rules.
we
thought
that
we
were
giving
assistance
and
help
to
the
court
by
arguing
the
--
the
cases
as
we
did.
i
would
say
also
that
if
the
questions
that
were
raised
to
mr.
madison
indicate
the
difficulties,
madison
is
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama.
the
difficulty
of
interpreting
the
rules
of
the
alabama
court
and,
although
alabama
has
said
the
rules
are
not
traps.
mr.
madison
seems
to
have
difficulty
in
telling
the
court
how
the
rules
are
applied
or
even
what
the
rules
are.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
attorney
general
seems
to
have
that
difficulty
then
certainly
an
ordinary
practitioner
would
also.
and
finally,
the
cash
bond
issue
which
was
raised.
i
want
to
say
that
on
this
cash
bond,
that
in
the
argument
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
i
think
i'm
quoting
mr.
madison
correctly
“indicated
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
this
was
a
question
but
it
was
not
being
pressed
by
him.”
now,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
knew
this
and
yet
passed
upon
--
dismissed
the
case
or
dispose
of
it
on
the
grounds
that
are
now
before
this
court.
on
the
ordinary
rules
and
procedure,
i
would
assume
that
having
had

before
--
before
it
that
the
court
has
therefore
disposed
of
it.
but
by
mr.
madison
raising
this
point
in
this
court
at
this

seeking
to
preserve
it
and
reinject
it
into
the
case,
it's
--
i
think
it
--
it
is
clear
that
the
difficulty
in
the
preca
--
precarious
procedural
difficulty
in
which
petitioner
would
find
itself
is

this
court
finally
settles
this
cause.

there's
been
no
questions
about
it
up
to
now.

had

mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
had
the
brief
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
filed
it,
printed
it
as
a
part
of
our
petition
up
to
this
point.
there's
been
no
question
raised
about
its
--
its
exactness
and
accuracy
and
it
to
be
(inaudible).
we
certainly
indicate
to
the
court
that
it
is
an
exact
copy
of
our
brief.
