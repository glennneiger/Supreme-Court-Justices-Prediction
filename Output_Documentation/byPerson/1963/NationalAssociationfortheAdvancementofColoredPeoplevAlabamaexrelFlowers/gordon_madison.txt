mr.
gordon
madison
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
the
court.
it's
been
a
number
of
different
attorneys
from
attorney
general's
office
and
the
various
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
other
courts.
but
my
rule
here
shows
a
need
to
attempt
to
the
state
--
to
the
court
what
the
state
now
conceives
to
be
involved
in
this
litigation
that's
here.
first
place,
the
state
of
alabama
doesn't
consider
that
the
merits
of
this
case
are
presented
to
this
court
this
time.
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
petitioner
is
that
its
activity
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
not
such
that
brings
it
within
the
purview
of
the
qualification
statutes
for
foreign
corporations.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
inquired
about
a
while
ago,
i
have
here
the
short
notes
that
i
made
on
the
back
of
the
little
brief
that
there
had
been
no
state
supreme
court
determination
that
petitioner
corporation
is
subject
to
the
foreign
corporation
qualifying
statutes.
i
was
moved
to
have
put
that
in
there
because
it
seldom
allot
to
handle
the
case
of
the
cio
of
american
state
and
federal
employees
organizing
committee
versus
windsor
in
which
the
state
statutes
which
required,
not
required
but
did
not
allow
state
employees
to
belong
to
labor
unions.
the
labor
union
contended
in
that
case
which
came
to
this
court
and
was
decided
that
it
was
not
a
union
within
the
meaning
of
those
statutes.
and
there,
it
was
held
in
effect
that
state
court
had
to
make
a
determination
of
that
matter
if
didn't
come
within
the
statute
where
no
federal
constitutional
questions
were
involved
or
provided.
now,
the
second
reason
that
i
have
here
is
that
the
case
seems
to
me
to
present
from
a
state
standpoint
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
reasonably
and
not
arbitrarily
applied
to
each
supreme
court
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
to
the
appellant
in
this
case.
if
it
has
so
applied
them,
and
i
think
this
court
has
a
right
to
determine
whether
it
has
or
not,
if
it
has
so
applied
those
rules
reasonably,
then
we
do
not
concede
that
the
court
have
purport
a
federal
question
for
decision.
and
the
result
would
be
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
stands
as
it
now,
is
affirming
the
lower
court
decision.
if
the
court
in
this
investigation
should
find
that
the
rules
and
procedure
and
practices
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
have
not
been
applied
reasonably
to
petitioner
in
this
case,
then
i
assume
that
the
court
--
i
say,
assume
--
i
--
i
presume,
i
put
it
that
way,
that
the
court
would
reverse
and
remand
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
and
if
it
thought
it
was
necessary,
although
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
it
has
been
done
at
that
level,
might
direct
that
court
to
proceed
with
the
consideration
of
all
the
questions
involved
on
the
merits
of
the
case
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
as
it
did
the
law
of
state
court
below.
now,
that
i
do
not
know
because
i
am
hoping
that
we
will
not
reach
that
question
and
that
the
court
will
find
that
there
has
been
no
unreasonable
application
of
the
rules
and
practices
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
now,
what
rule
and
practice
did
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
applied
the
petition
in
this
case?
in
the
first
place,
it
considered
petitioner's
brief
in
that
court.
it
didn't
strike
its
brief.
it
didn't
dismiss
the
case.
it
didn't
affirm
the
case
because
it
wasn't
a
brief
that
was
sufficient
to
the
rule
and
practices
of
that
court.
it
considered
the
brief
but
it
got
to
the
point
where
that
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
that
you
have
placed
five
subdivisions
in
your
brief
and
on
the
each,
you
have
made
joint
assignments
of
error.
and
if
anyone
of
those
joint
assignments
of
error
is
bad,
is
not
good
on
our
practice
and
all
other
state,
now
as
far
as
i
know,
certainly
and
that's
a
good
--
good
time
back
from
our
law
schools
some
40
years
ago
or
maybe
39
to
40,
we
--
we
learned
that
there
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
been
the
practice
ever
since
i've
been
practicing
law
in
the
ever
distinguished
member
of
this
court
who
probably
knows
--
still
knows
more
about
alabama
practice
and
i
do
it
could
say
one
way
or
the
other
buried
himself.
but
i
know
that
we,
in
our
actual
practice,
we're
careful
not
to
group
together
a
number
of
assignments
of
error
we
had
impart
a
point.
we
put
it
all
there
by
itself.
the
court
erred
in
a
certain
particular
and
argued
that
in
detail
rather
than
in
group.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
the
rule
itself
does
not
say
that,
not
specifically
but
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
interpreting
the
rule,
i
guess
your
honor,
they
have
held
it
at
least
--
i
believe
i
think
it's
for
a
period
of
60
years
and
that
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
think
what
the
--
what
the
practice
is
that,
as
i
just
stated,
where
you
have
an
assignment
urged
you
want
to
insist
upon,
you
set
that
assignment
out
of
specifically
and
separated
from
the
rest
of
them
and
argued
in
brief.
and
now,
when
you
begin
to
put
several
of
them
together,
you
run
into
the
court's
interpretation
and
i
think
it's
based
possibly
on
convenience
or
necessity
to
the
court
or
the
--
whether
the
judge
in
this
case
said
--
justice
in
this
case
said
not
to
have
to
search
the
entire
record
to
find
out
the
different
types
of
rules
that
might
apply.
he
gave
--
mr.
gordon
madison
do
you
mean
what
do
--
what
the
justice
put
in
his
opinion?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
may
i
answer
that
this
way,
your
honor,
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
said,
it
does
make
a
difference
and
has
given
its
reason
as
to
why
it
makes
it
different.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
think
it
states
in
the
opinion
here,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
madison
you
mean
does
the
rule
require
that,
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
madison
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
don't
put
my
finger
right
on
it
there.
i
cannot
--
i
believe
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
to
either
his
or
my
satisfaction
this
time
and
before
my
time
is
up,
i
will
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
assignments
of
error?
mr.
gordon
madison
oh,
they're
typewritten.
mr.
gordon
madison
they
can
be
written
both
ways.
you
can
write
them
in
the
longhand
and
assign
them
on
the
back
of
--
of
the
record
or
you
can
put
them
in
with
the
typewriter.
mr.
gordon
madison
oh,
yes,
you
required
to
set
out
a
page
in
your
argument
while
you
--
your
assignments
of
error
where
it
occurred.
mr.
gordon
madison
where
the
rule
in
the
period.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
part
of
your
assignments
of
error
as
i
understand
your
point.
mr.
gordon
madison
of
the
record.
mr.
gordon
madison
if
it
finds
one
to
be
bad.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
does
not
consider
the
rest
of
the
group
assignments
of
error
unless
they're
related.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
clearly
understand.
there
maybe
an
assignment
of
error
which
is
not
a
proper
assignment
of
error.
there
maybe
an
--
mr.
gordon
madison
alright.
mr.
gordon
madison
you
have
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
10
errors,
all
of
which
have
been
properly
assigned
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
and
then
they
are
grouped
together
for
argument
and
if
anyone
of
the
ten
are
bad,
the
court
does
not
consider
the
other.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
i
don't
know
of
instance
which
it
has
not
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
--
i'd
say
the
--
about
150
cases
in
the
brief
which
i
have
applied
it
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
guess
you
could
change
its
opinion
just
like
this
court
could.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
know
of
no
such
rule.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
only
that
i
would
say
in
reply
to
that,
your
honor,
or
not
in
reply
to
it
but
the
--
in
--
i've
just
simply
say
that
it
would
--
if
it
says
that
the
10
assignments
of
error
are
grouped
together
and
that
we
find
this
one's
bad
but
we
now
changed
the
previous
decisions
and
rules
of
this
court
over
a
period
of
some
60
or
70,
75
years
and
now
say
that
we
will
consider
the
others
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
to
take
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
it.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
i
haven't
found
one.
i
haven't
looked
one.
i
don't
believe
you
will
find
one
that
would
say
that.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
think
it
has
more
dignity
in
the
standing
and
if
the
--
you
call
it
a
rule
of
thumb
in
--
in
our
(inaudible).
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
any
supreme
court
--
the
state
supreme
court
within
its
proper
level
or
this
court
within
its
--
can
--
can
be
so
bound.
it
wouldn't
be
supreme
if
it
bound
it
with.
mr.
gordon
madison
what
page
is
it
on,
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
madison
page
--
page
what?
mr.
gordon
madison
38.
mr.
gordon
madison
oh,
i
think
it's
16th
--
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
on
top
of
page
33a,
appellant
submits
an
assignment
of
error
number
5
that
this
denial
was
--
mr.
gordon
madison
from
the
second?
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
the
--
mr.
gordon
madison
number
3.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
42a.
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
my
understanding
of
what
is
referred
--
mr.
gordon
madison
your
honor,
that's
bring
back
to
the
question
of
whether
they're
argued
in
bulk
or
whether
they're
argued
separately.
the
court
from
the
way
they
are
assigned
in
this
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
determined
that
it
--
they
have
been
argued
in
bulk.
now,
your
honors,
in
looking
that,
it
may
determine
that
they
have
not.
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
i
--
i
couldn't
say
what's
that
and
in
the
court's
decision
whether
it
is
number
or
what
not.
it
may
be
a
separate
argument
in
a
separate
paragraph.
we
all
might
so
determine.
i
--
i
wouldn't
know
but
--
mr.
gordon
madison
i
--
i
put
assignment
of
error
number
1
either
as
follows
and
that
the
court
erred
in
certain
respect
and
i
wouldn't
cover
anything
else
up
with
it
until
i'd
given
out
over
my
main
point.
and
when
i've
given
out
the
things
i
really
ordered
and
insist
on,
i
might
through
four
or
five
together
and
argue
one
of
it
to
deal
into
my
brief
itself.
that's
the
way
i
do
it.
mr.
gordon
madison
separate
headings.
and
i
usually
--
in
the
state
practice
when
i
--
i
was
practicing
there,
i
recited
the
assignment
of
error
number
1
and
quoted
in
the
brief
and
then
followed
an
argument
said
this
argument
relates
to
assignment
of
error
number
1.
well,
i
don't
set
that
up
as
it's
motivating
anybody
to
follow
but
that's
the
way
i
did
and
i
manage
to
keep
in
court
some
error.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
direction
which
the
supreme
court
gave
to
the
--
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
case
and
tried
it,
unless
the
state
court
finish
and
tried
it
by
january
the
2nd.
again
on
the
merits
that
i
was
not
certain
and
not
sure
just
where
that
supervision
began
and
where
it
ended
the
district
court's
supervision
over
the
handling
of
that
case.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
delay
or
relaxity
that
i
didn't
want
to
raise
any
questions
about
the
brief
and
at
this
point,
your
honor,
if
you'll
permit
me,
i'll
--
i'll
show
one
other
thing
for
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
waiving
it,
the
petition
in
this
case
gave
a
cash
bond
on
appeal
from
the
--
from
the
circuit
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
your
honors,
specific
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
a
cash
bond
is
not
sufficient.
the
court
can
give
petitioner
time
to
perfect
it
before
submission
of
the
case
and
have
a
proper
bond.
i
did
not
raise
any
either.
i
call
the
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
that
cash
bond
had
been
given
that
i
knew
what
their
requirements
were
and
left
it
at
that
point.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
--
if
your
honor,
it
maybe
in
the
collection
when
you
run
the
judgment
against
the
principle
assures
it
on
a
bond,
maybe
one
thing
but
how
you'd
run
the
judgment
against
the
money,
i
don't
know
but
i
do
not
hope
to
justify
to
this
court
all
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
all
questions
before
it.
i'll
just
do
the
best
that
i
can
but
some
of
them
or
some
have
been
(inaudible)
on
the
merit.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
state
court
under
the
state
statute
which
required
the
giving
of
a
bond
as
a
condition
preceded
to
appeal
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
while
the
principle
assures
it
on
that
bond,
they
gave
cash
bonds
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
--
i
do
--
i
don't
assume.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
did
not
raise
it
below.
now,
well,
i
can
waive
or
give
consent
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court,
does
nothing
else.
mr.
gordon
madison
i'm
not
waiving
it
because
we
had
one
decision
to
go
back
for
the
attorney
general
and
whoever
is
with
him
at
that
time,
failed
to
present
in
this
court
what
the
one
question
of
whether
to
produce
a
membership
list.
now,
it
doesn't
matter
to
me
one
way
or
another
about
that
cash
bond
business.
it
may
be
trivial.
it
maybe
--
i'm
concerned
only
in
doing
my
job.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so
and
i
think
you
take
on
the
law
side.
mr.
gordon
madison
on
that
--
all
side
of
the
court,
those
types
of
matters
are
raised
on
motion
for
new
trial
and
i
assume
by
an
application
for
rehearing
in
the
--
on
every
side
of
the
court.
but
they
are
not
matters
which
our
state
practice
concedes
to
be
appealable
below
with
some
other
methods.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they
will
review
it
if
it's
properly
assigned
as
an
error.
it
reviews
error.
it
reviews
error
which
occurred
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
some
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
introduction
of
evidence,
some
matter
of
that
nature.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
will
not
accept
it
because
it's
not
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
that
court
and
--
and
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
it's
not
an
assignment
of
--
of
error
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
appealable
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
to
be
considered
for
that
court.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
i
will
not
say
that,
your
honor,
because
they
are
--
if
they
are
properly
raised
in
the
court
below.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
that
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
that
time,
what
you're
speaking
about
that,
has
been
--
one
of
the
assignments
of
error.
mr.
gordon
madison
let
me
see
if
i
can
--
let's
jump
on
one
of
the
law
side
of
the
court
for
instance.
if
you
had
a
question
of
the
verdict
being
contrary
to
evidence,
you
raised
that
by
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
gordon
madison
the
lower
court
rules
on
that
then
it
is
reviewable
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
gordon
madison
i'm
trying
to
say
that
that
type
of
assignment
of
error
is
not
originally
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
don't
think
--
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
means
by
merit.
it
is
not
--
it
hadn't
been
assigned
in
such
manners
as
to
be
considered
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
suppose,
your
honor,
that
practice
which
he
does
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
alabama,
generally,
require
for
a
consideration
of
that
question
which
you
just
asked
me
about
that
you
have
to
raise
it
by
an
application
for
rehearing
in
the
lower
court
or
you
have
to
raise
it
by
a
motion
for
new
trial
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
in
the
lower
court
and
if
you
do
not,
you
cannot
present
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
the
first
time
only.
mr.
gordon
madison
on
the
rehearing
in
--
itself
for
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well
--
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
but
don't
they
go
further
and
say
that
the
application
read
--
what
does
it
review
under
that
but
--
mr.
gordon
madison
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
of
alabama
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
try
to
point
out
again,
it's
without
merit
as
being
an
assignment
of
error.
i
don't
think
he
has
passed
on
the
merits
of
what
is
contained
in
the
assignments,
if
i
may
say
it
that
way.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
that
--
that
would
--
would
be
a
big
difference
i
think,
your
honor,
in
the
passing
on
whether
the
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
madison
that's
where
the
case
was
disposed
of.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
way
in
which
that
particular
point
could
have
been
properly
raised
and
it
was
not
done,
would
you
have
the
same
question
on
that
if
--
if
--
mr.
gordon
madison
the
--
the
court
of
--
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
--
i
certainly
cannot
answer
that
for
simple
reason,
i
don't
know.
i
say
this
that
i
was
on
the
impression
and
still
on
the
impression
and
as
you
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
applied
some
of
its
rules
or
procedures
and
practice
which
it
should
not
have
that
it
did
on
it
in
an
arbitrary
or
in
a
reasonable
manner
to
this
petitioner
that
you
--
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
let
me
say
this.
if
the
--
if
this
court
is
going
to
pass
upon
the
merits
of
this
entire
litigation
here
without
--
it
never
have
been
passed
on
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
i
--
it
doesn't
matter
as
far
--
so
far
as
i'm
concern
but
there
were
three
volume
and
1347
pages
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
filed
that.
in
this
brief
here,
i
mean
in
this
record
here,
there
are
only
231.
i
wish
the
court
would
have
before
it
the
entire
record
which
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
with
considerations.
mr.
gordon
madison
yes,
sir,
it
can
be
brought
here.
and
then
i
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
or
the
--
the
attorney
general
would
also
like
to
have
an
opportunity
to
know
specific,
if
he
can
do
so.
mr.
gordon
madison
to
know
specifically,
if
you
will
take
in
the
case
on
the
merits
so
we
can
brief
the
merits
specifically
for
you
and
submit
our
brief
on
those
forms.
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i
--
mr.
gordon
madison
even
if
that
would
be
the
correct,
your
honor
--
mr.
gordon
madison
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
correct
position
of
the
court
even
if
it
is
then
it
should
have
the
entire
with
those
--
before
the
court
attempt
to
pass
on
itself.
there
have
been
--
if
there
are
any
(inaudible)
have
any
argument
left
have
been
rather
have
been
put
away
or
shut
away
but
if
any
question
that
i
might
be
able
to
answer
which
the
court
wishes
to
ask
me,
i
will
be
glad
to
endeavor
to
do
it.
mr.
gordon
madison
it
means,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it
that
the
--
without
merit
--
2,
3
and
4
without
merit
because
one
of
the
joint
assignments
of
error
has
been
proven
to
be
bad.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
mr.
gordon
madison
what
--
which
are
you
--
mr.
gordon
madison
and
at
which
page
are
you
now?
mr.
gordon
madison
now
--
yes,
sir,
i
see
and
object
to
what
you're
speaking
about
and
say
that
we
have
repeatedly
held
this
type
of
assignment
of
error
without
the
merit
presents
nothing
for
review.
i
assume
that
those
cases
they
cite
there
will
give
some
reason
why
the
appellate
court
considered
them
to
be
without
--
and
i
haven't
read
those
cases
recently
to
--
to
be
able
to
explain
to
your
honors'
satisfaction
what
the
whole
--
if
they've
given
the
explanation
and
i
don't
want
to
attempt
to
do
it.
i
--
i'd
be
glad
for
an
opportunity
to
analyze
the
brief
--
mr.
gordon
madison
now,
your
honor
asked
me
a
question
way
back
there.
i
--
we
--
we've
all
lost
it
in
the
discussion.
it
may
have
been
--
you've
been
satisfied
to
other
discussion
but
i
don't
know
what
that
--
your
honor
--
mr.
gordon
madison
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
madison
well,
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
your
honor's
question
this
way
with
the
--
with
the
deepest
respect
for
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
too.
it
is
most
difficult
sometimes
for
me
out
here
to
give
an
explanation
as
to
why
a
court
did
a
certain
thing
on
its
reasons
for.
sometimes
i
know
and
sometimes
i
do
not.
thank
you.
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
i
make
no
point
--
mr.
gordon
madison
--
presented
his
brief.
mr.
gordon
madison
i
would
like
to
call
it
--
mr.
gordon
madison
no,
sir.
i
don't
make
no
point
on
it.
i
also
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
these
assignments
of
error
are
not
in
the
record
either.
they
ought
to
be
before
the
court
in
some
way,
i
think.
