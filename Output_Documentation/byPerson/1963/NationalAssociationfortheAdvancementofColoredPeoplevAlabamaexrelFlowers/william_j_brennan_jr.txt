justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
understand
your
reasoning
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
my
question
is
that
--
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
detailed
decree,
which
one
is
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
would
our
decree
say?
i'm
still
puzzled.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
recall
if
the
court
said
--
had
done
anything
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
something
like
that
may
have
been
done
(inaudible)
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
something
like
that
may
have
been
done,
it
will
continue
the
decision
was
it
not,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
long
time
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
what
was
posted
does
not
satisfy
a
state
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
suggested
that
this
would
have
go
back?
there
maybe
that
basis
for
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
i
think
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
not
waiving
it,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
at
page
7a
i
suggest
is
the
matter,
applying
the
same
rule
of
2
to
4
or
5
(voice

page

of
the
cert

i'm
sorry,
or
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
7a.
that
first
full
paragraph.
applying
the
same
rule
is
heretofore
by
in
the
previous
subsections,
none
of
the
assignments
of
error
will
be
considered.
that
goes
back
to
the
joinder
of
2,
3,
4,
8
and
17
having
held
in
2,
3
and
4
without
merit
and
that
being
a
deficient
assignment.
they,
therefore,
say
the
8
and
17
joined
that
2,
3
and
4
cannot
be
considered.
am
i
correct
in
reading
it
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
madison,
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
question
that
--
the
copy
of
the
briefs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
debate
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
is
the
copy
that
--
the
copy
of
what
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
was
filed
with
the
alabama
supreme
court?
