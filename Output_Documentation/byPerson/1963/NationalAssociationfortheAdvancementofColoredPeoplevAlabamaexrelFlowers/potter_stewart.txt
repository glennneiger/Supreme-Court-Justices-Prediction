justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
--
isn't
that
question
one
for
alabama
on
the
merits
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
registration
statute,
its
construction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
something
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
never
--
has
never
expressed
its
views
on,
as
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
this
case,
it
--
it
decided
your
appeal
for
on
--
procedural
on
a
--
for
procedural
reasons
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
admitted
that
you
had
not
and
you
expressed
your
willingness
to
do
so
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
it
applied,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
never
been
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
addressing
yourself
now
to
the
construction
of
the
alabama
registration
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
that
question,
that
question
is
purely
and
solely
exclusively
a
matter
of
state
law.
now,
you
also
present
--
presented
here
in
your
briefs
that
federal
constitutional
questions
which
are
very
properly
the
business
of
this
court
assuming
that
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
quite
understand
how
this
rule
has
anything
to
do
with
searching
the
entire
record.
i
didn't
understand
that
part
at
all,
that
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
he
said
that
if
we
didn't
enforce
this
rule
over
their
powers
to
search
the
entire
record,
i'm
not
trying
to
quote
him
but
i
--
the
opinion
and
--
and
that
we
just
don't
have
the
time
to
do
that
really.
i
don't
see
what
this
rule
has
to
do
with
the
--
the
time
to
search
the
entire
record.
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
arguments
are
made,
what
difference
does
it
make,
how
they
are
grouped?
so
far
as
the
---
whether
or
not
the
court's
going
to
be
required
to
search
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
--
what
are
--
what
is
the
reason,
what
are
the
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand.
what's
--
what's
considered,
that
is
in
cash
in
alabama,
more
value?
justice
potter
stewart
that
question,
i
think,
had
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
connection
between
this
rule
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
i.e.
that
if
various
assignment
of
--
assignments
of
error
are
grouped
together
and
if
its
found
that
one
is
not
validly
--
is
not
a
valid
one
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
will
not
consider
any
of
the
others
under
that
group,
that
is
this
basic
rule,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
now,
my
question
was
what
--
why
--
why
does
that
--
why
would
--
why
would
this
regard
of
that
rule
require
the
supreme
court
to
do
all
their
searching
of
the
record
that
they
talk
about
in
this
opinion.
that's
--
that's
the
only
thing
i
didn't
understand.
i
didn't
understand
the
connection
between
the
--
between
that
rule
and
the
--
and
the
undesirability
for
requiring
them
to
search
the
record
in
every
case.
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
i
understand
why
--
why
a
reviewing
court
can't
be
asked
to
--
shouldn't
be
required
to
in
every
case
without
any
help
from
counsel
to
get
out
of
the
record
and
go
to
it
alone
on
their
own
motion
but
i
don't
see
what
this
rule
has
to
do
with
preventing
that
verdict.
that
--
that
was
my
only
question.
i
didn't
understand
the
chain
of
reasoning
of
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
