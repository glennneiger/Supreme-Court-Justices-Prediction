may
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice

do
they
have
to

or
can
they

written

the

justice

are
they
written

justice

you're
not
required
to
give
the
--
the

assignment

certain
evidence
being
introduced
or
not
required
to
assign

set
out
the

on
which
that
can
be
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
(voice

part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
part
of
the
assignment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
to
give
the
page
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
court
has
construed
the
rules
as
a
whole
as
i
gather
it.
it
means
that
if
you
argued
ten
assignments
under
one
heading,
the
court
does
not
consider
anyone
of
those
assignments
or
else
it
consider
one
and
need
consider
no
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
finds
one
to
be
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
finds
one
to
be
bad
then
what
does
it
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
if
--
if
it
finds
the
assignment
of
error
is
not
valid,
it's
not
meritorious,
finds
one,
it
doesn't
consider
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
bunched
together,
court
looks
and
finds
that
one
of
them
--
they'd
overruled
it.
is
it
--
what
you're
saying,
if
the
court
then
is
not
required
to
look
at
any
of
the
other
nine
assignments
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
grouped
together?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
of
course,
that's
a
rule
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
follow,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
wouldn't
--
it
would
not
bind
itself
so
that
it
--
no
statute
requires
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
look
by
the
brief,
you
have
cited
cases
in
which
the
court
has
given
that
as
its
reason
for
deciding
that
particular
case
but
has
it
ever
said
that
there's
any
rule
that
it
can
violate
if
it
desires
to
that
affect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
changing
its
opinions,
i'm
talking
about
whether
it
has
--
they
have
written
out
no
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
that
bars
the
court
in
considering
each
of
the
assignments,
although
10
are
argued
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
--
no
such
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
--
that's
the
question
i'm
asking
you.
they
may
have
said
50
or
60
--
you
may
find
50
or
60
years
that
the
case
has
been
affirmed
on
that
date
or
reversed
on
that
date,
which
ever
it
is
affirmed,
but
have
you
found
in
it
that
says
the
court
cannot,
if
it
wants
to
look
at
each
one
separately,
even
though
they're
argued
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
cause
--
caused
it.
it's
jusyt
a
rule
of
thumb
that
uses,
is
it
not,
in
connection
with
the
particular
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
the
reference
i've
made
to
meet
various
crew
of
the
court,
all
of
the
assignments
of
error,
very
well
indeed.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
if
there's
anything
in
any
of
the
opinion
which
a
man
can
say
the
court
considered
itself
helpless
to
rule
differently
if
it
sees
fit
in
that
particular
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
arrange
that.
they
said
the
judgment
decree
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
or
the
questions
by
assessing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
motion
for
rehearing

court

in
this
case
on

justice
hugo
l.
black
this
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
same
way
--
there
is
the
same
way
of
both
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
did
not
pass
by
reason
of
error
and
cannot
pass
on
it
by
reason
of
error
then
it's
before
us
that
we
have
to
consider
it
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
on

supposed
it's
wrong,
wholly
wrong
and
it
was
not
suppose
--
it
wasn't
the
evidence
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decides
to
rule
on
in
the
highest
court
in
the
state
passed
on
that
by
the
court
of
--
by
the
circuit
court
so
that
it
will
bring
the
record
around,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it
was
raised
in
both
places.
i
can
imagine
if
--
if
it
was
the
case
on
the
rule
of
every
court
in
the
united
states
if
it's
not.
you
don't
raise
the
question
as
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
by
saying
it's
(inaudible)
what
is
supported
by
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
can
imagine
that
there's
been
some
rules
adopted
but
that's
not
a
sufficient
rule
but
if
it
is
and
the
court
found
it
in
the
--
the
supreme
court
then
that's
all
of
those
facts
on
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
to
pass
on
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
circuit
court,
judge
jones.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
told
him
that
he
did
--
that
he
was
wrong
in
the
motion
for
rehearing
because
it's
contrary
to
the
right
weight
of
the
evidence.
he
overruled
a
motion
for
rehearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
passed
it.
now,
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
has
not
passed
on
it
you
say
as
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
in
response
to
justice
white,
suppose
they
haven't
then
we
must
look
to
the
judgment
from
that
point
if
the
court
--
circuit
court
is
being
the
highest
court
in
which
the
question
could
be
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
accessible,
isn't
it?
it
can
be
brought
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
your
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
state
court
for
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
your
record,
it's
not
in
the
appendix?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
agreed
by
the
other
party
that
it's
correct
as
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
important
in
connection
of
what
you
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
that
the
charges
the
supreme
court
seems
to
have
held
in
--
in
arguments
involving
their
practice
and
is
it
agreed
that
that
is
a
correct
copy
of
the
brief
you
filed
with
the
supreme
court,
if
not,
we
need
to
--
we
need
a
record
of
it.
