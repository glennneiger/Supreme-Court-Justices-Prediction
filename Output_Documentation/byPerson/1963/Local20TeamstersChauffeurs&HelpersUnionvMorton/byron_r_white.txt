that

across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
the
court
below
must
not
have
agreed
with
you
that
following
trucks
was
lawful
under
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
federal
law
that
makes
it
lawful
in
the
power
structure?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
at
least
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
recent
--
the
recent
--
the
most
recent
amendments
of
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
the
most
recent
amendments
never
--
had
never
--
at
least
since
that,
it
hasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
most
recent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
most
recent
amendments
of
the
secondary
boycott.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
303
is
the
total
and
exclusive
major
source
of
damages
in
the
context
set
forth.
justice
byron
r.

non-violent,
non-violent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
a
--
a
question
of
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
really
of
--
of
jurisdiction
over
the
suit.
i
don't
suppose
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
really
just
talking
about
your
--
what
you
call
jurisdiction
to
give
a
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
that
mean
that
--
would
that
mean
that
it
--
that
picketing
in
the
primary
site,
outside
the
plant
if
some
employee
decides
to
stay
away
from
work
because
he
--
he's
afraid
that
if
he
tried
to
cross
the
picket
line,
he'll
be
hurt
that
this
following
was
a
violence
category
and
be
enjoinable
state
law
--
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
on
your
theory
--
on
your
theory,
all
he
--
all
the
employee
would
have
to
do
is
to
take
a
look
at
the
picket
line
and
that
be
fearful.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
happened
in
your
situation?
you
just
thought
--
he
just
knew
that
trucks
were
being
followed
or
thought
they
were
and
became
fearful.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
your
--
in
--
in
the
one
case
of
being
fearful
in
crossing
a
picket
line
and
his
--
his
fear
is
then
preceded
by
an
event
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
being
rebuffed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
what
event
--
what
--
what
event
occurred
here
which
you
might
reasonably
give
rise
to
fear
of
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
following
--
following,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
indication
that
they
said
anything
or
did
anything
to
any
truck
driver
they
followed.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
is
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
--
even
if
you
--
even
if
you
thought
he's
fear
was
reasonable,
why
should
it
be
--
why
should
we
assume
that
other
people
said
the
same
--
other
people
had
--
the
other
drivers
had
the
same
fear
when,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
others
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
others,
i
take
it
that
--
i
take
it,
the
employer
always
had
some
drivers
who
--
who
didn't
honor
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
35,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
ultimately
there
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
35
out
of
50.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
--
why
should
it
be
inferred
that
anybody
but
--
but
this
one
man
had
the
--
had
the
fear?
why
should
it
be
inferred
that
anyone
--
anyone
but
--
but
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lower
court
did
this,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
how
else
did
they
get
a
connection
between
--
between
illegal
act
--
how
could
they
attribute
to
illegal
activity
all
the
damages
at
--
at
wilson
in
determination
of
wilson
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
the
only
--
the
only
reason
that
he
couldn't
complete
a
contract
with
wilson
or
thought
he
couldn't
was
where
--
there
weren't
any
drivers
--
there
weren't
going
to
be
any
drivers.
now,
the
only
suggested
illegal
act
causing
there'd
being
no
drivers
is
this
one
man,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
are
worried
about
the
ones
who
went
to
work,
we're
worried
about
the
ones
who
stayed
away.
