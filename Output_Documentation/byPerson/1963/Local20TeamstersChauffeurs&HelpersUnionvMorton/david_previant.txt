mr.
david
previant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
--
excuse
me,
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
involves
the
question
of
the
scope
and
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
preemption
as
applied
to
section
303
damage
cases
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
court
below
has
sustained
a
judgment
against
petitioner
here
for
actual
and
punitive
damages
which
is
based
upon
ohio
common
law
for
actual
compensatory
damages
based
upon
section
303
and
for
what
is
known
as
a
totality
of
effort
rule
damages,
also
under
303.
in
other
words,
we
are
confronted
here
with,
actually,
the
application
of
four
different
measures
of
damages
to
the
dispute
which
arose
in
this
case.
the
facts
are
relatively
free
from
controversy.
i
think,
the
--
there's
--
mr.
david
previant
a
--
a
measure
of
damages
which
is
known
now
as
totality
of
effort
damages
and
which
the
court
below
said
that
as
long
as
they
were
both
unlawful,
as
well
as
lawful
act,
it
would
total
up
all
damages
even
though
the
lawful
act
--
the
damages
flowing
from
the
lawful
acts
could
be
readily
ascertained
as
well
as
the
damages
flowing
from
the
unlawful
act.
the
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
it
is
a
new
concept
here.
some
of
the
circuits
appeared
to
be
following
it,
but
i
think
there's
even
some
question
as
to
what
the
circuits
mean
when
they
say
totality
of
effort.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
this
--
this
has
been
applied
under
section
303
without
any
reference
to
the
state
common
law.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
say,
the
facts
are
relatively
free
from
dispute
but
there
are
some
question
raised
here
in
this
court
as
to
the
significance
of
some
of
these
facts
in
connection
with
the
application
of
the
damage
rule
below.
the
petitioner,
local
is
a
labor
union
in
cleo,
ohio
and
the
respondent,
lester
morton,
conducts
a
trucking
business
in
tiffin,
ohio
and
services
principally
the
construction
trades.
he
operates
principally,
dump
trucks
on
a
contract
hauler
basis
with
various
customers
and
suppliers.
there
is
no
problem
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
activities
involve
interstate
commerce.
the
local
union
had
represented
employees
of
morton
for
a
number
of
years,
but
it
never
had
a
written
contract.
in
the
latter
part
of
1956,
request
was
made
upon
morton
for
a
written
contract
and
upon
morton's
refusal
because
he
said
his
competitors
were
not
organized,
the
union
went
on
strike.
the
strike
lasted
some
five
or
six
weeks.
the
strike
was,
in
all
respects,
conducted
peaceably.
there
was
peaceful
picketing
at
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer,
mr.
morton.
there
was
no
interference
with
the
ingress
or
egress
at
anytime
at
the
morton
premises.
there
was
no
violence
or
threat
of
violence
at
the
morton
premises.
there
was
no
physical
injury
to
person
or
property
at
the
morton
premises
or
other
places
nor
was
there,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
any
violence
or
threat
of
violence
at
secondary
sites
as
well
as
at
mr.
morton's
site.
not
all
of
the
employees
went
out
on
strike
from
a
force
of
some
50
driving
employees,
i
think
probably
some
20
or
--
or
more
returned
to
work,
did
not
recognize
the
strike
call
and
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
other
strikers
returned
and
the
record
will
show
here
that
the
employer
eventually
wound
up
with
30
to
35
drivers
out
of
a
total
complement
of
50
when
the
strike
started.
the
--
the
section
303
violations
arose
at
three
different
places
which
morton
serviced.
one
was
a
quarry,
striking
employees
followed
trucks
as
they
left
the
morton
premises
and
went
to
the
quarry
and
there
picketed.
the
court
below
found
that
this
was
a
violation
of
section
303
as
well
as
a
violation
of
the
ohio
common
law,
but
in
as
much
as
no
employees
were
actually
induced
by
the
picketing,
as
--
and
as
much
as
there
was
no
actual
--
excuse
me
--
as
long
as
there
was
no
actual
termination
of
work,
there
were
no
damages
assessed
at
that
particular
account,
that's
france
account.
some
trucks
were
followed
from
the
quarry
to
a
schoen
place
of
business.
thereto,
there
was
a
temporary
refusal
to
load
and
unload,
there
was
picketing
at
schoen
but
there
to
the
court
did
not
find
any
damages
although,
it
did
find
that
this
type
of
picketing
was
in
violation
of
section
302
--
3
and
in
violation
of
the
ohio
common
law
related
to
secondary
boycotts.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
think
that
we
can.
there
maybe
some
question
not
having
found
a
common
law
violation
even
if
there
were
no
damages
because
the
court
below
assessed
punitive
damages
but
punitive
damages
is
in
--
is
in
the
case
in
any
event,
the
question
of
punitive
damages
under
ohio
common
law.
at
the
third
place
called
o'connel's,
the
union
had
advised
the
steward
that
there
was
a
strike.
it
had
not
attempted
in
anyway
to
persuade
or
to
urge
or
to
induce
any
other
employees
to
stop
work
or
even
to
induce
the
steward
to
stop
work.
the
steward
in
turn
informed
his
employer
and
his
employer
then
determined
voluntarily
to
stop
doing
business
with
morton
while
the
strike
was
on.
in
this
instance,
the
court
found
that
because
of
the
termination
of
o'connel's
contract
with
morton,
there
were
$1600
damages
and
again
hereto,
this
was
assessed
as
being
both
in
violation
of
section
303
and
in
violation
of
the
ohio
state
common
law.
there
was
another
customer
of
morton,
which
was
called
the
wilson
account
and
mr.
wilson
had
entered
into
a
contract
with
mr.
morton
for
mr.
morton
to
deliver
certain
building
materials
to
a
highway
construction
project.
the
record
is
clear
that
at
no
time
did
the
union
ever
approach
mr.
wilson
directly
or
indirectly.
at
no
time
was
mr.
wilson
aware
of
any
secondary
or
other
activities
at
any
place.
but
mr.
wilson
was
informed
of
the
strike
by
mr.
morton,
who
advised
mr.
morton
that
--
who
advised
mr.
wilson
that
because
of
the
strike,
there
would
be
some
problem
in
furnishing
to
mr.
wilson
all
of
the
tucks
which
mr.
wilson
might
require
in
order
to
supply
the
job
in
which
he
was
going
to
embark.
the
court
here,
finding
that
this
was
lawful,
nevertheless
in
assessing
damages,
assessed
some
$9300
in
damages
on
the
wilson
account
and
this
is
the
totality
of
effort
theory,
that
even
though
the
damages
at
wilson
could
be
clearly
segregated,
even
though
there
wasn't
the
slightest
suggestion
of
any
kind
of
unlawful
activity
at
wilson,
in
fact,
not
even
a
telephone
call
to
mr.
wilson,
the
court
nevertheless
said
that
as
--
because
of
the
result
of
a
combination
of
a
lawful
strike
at
morton's
premises
and
other
unlawful
activity
which
took
place
at
the
other
premises
which
we
have
described
here,
the
--
the
court
had
a
right
under
this
totality
of
effort
theory
to
add
up
to
the
actual
direct
damages
provable
at
the
secondary
sites,
with
the
actual
damages
not
direct
provable
at
wilson
and
therefore,
under
this
totality
of
effort
theory,
assessed
an
additional
$9300
in
damages.
the
fifth
account
is
the
account
that's
known
as
the
launder
account.
mr.
david
previant
well,
it
--
it
wasn't
just
that
clear.
the
court
did
say
that
it
was
unlawful
and
lawful.
there
--
there's
a
peculiar
line
of
reasoning
that
occurred
here
and
--
and
it
was
this,
and
perhaps
we
could
discuss
it
right
now.
there
was
one
witness
out
of
some
23
who
took
the
stand.
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
union
and
he
inadvertently
blurted
out
that
he
had
voted
against
the
strike,
there
had
been
a
secret
ballot
strike
vote,
but
he
did
not
return
to
work
and
he
was
asked
by
counsel
for
the
employer
why
he
did
it.
mr.
david
previant
that's
taulve,
that's
right,
i
--
i
must
confess
that
there
are
some
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
the
spelling
of
that
man's
name.
i
think,
we
refer
to
him
as
t-a-u-l-v-e
and
he's
--
sometimes,
we
refer
to
him
to
the
record
as
t-a-l-l-v-e.
now,
he
did
not
return
to
work
and
when
put
on
the
stand,
he
was
asked,
"why?"
and
over
objection,
he
testified
that
number
one,
he
was
told
that
his
union
card
would
be
pulled
if
he
went
through
the
picket
line
and
then
upon
urging
and
prompting,
he
said,
“well,
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
trucks
were
followed
and
i
was
afraid
that
maybe
someone
would
get
hurt.”
on
cross-examination,
and
we
have
set
forth
at
--
this,
i
think,
in
considerable
length
in
our
principal
brief,
on
cross-examination,
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
of
no
violence,
that
there
was
no
violence,
that
he
had
heard
of
no
problems
in
following
the
truck,
that
there
had
been
no
problems
at
the
premises,
that
he
had
never
been
threatened
with
violence,
had
he
--
that
he
had
seen,
i
guess
in
his
own
words,
“i
have
seen
no
troubles,
there
was
no
trouble.”
now,
the
court,
on
this
single
incident,
engaged
in
reasoning
which
it
had
earlier
described
as
fairly
fantastic
when
asked
to
make
the
rule
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
that
since
mr.
taulve
had
this
subjective
and
obviously
unsupportable,
indemonstrable
fear
that
something
would
happen
to
him
if
his
truck
were
followed,
that
must
mean
that
other
striking
drivers
or
other
people
who
would
seek
employment
might
similarly
have
this
subjective
conjectural
fear.
and
therefore,
if
he
had
and
if
others
might
have
it,
therefore,
we
might
say
then
that
mr.
morton
did
not
have
a
full
proof
because
not
only
did
some
strikers
stay
out
as
a
result
of
the
strike,
but
some
must
have
stayed
out
because
they
were
afraid
to
return.
counsel
here
argues
that
the
burden
would
have
been
on
the
union
in
that
instance
to
parade
all
of
the
strikers
to
the
stand
and
to
disavow
any
fear
and
to
say,
we're
on
strike
because
we're
on
strike.
and
of
course,
it
is
our
position
that
the
incident
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
even
begin
to
meet
any
kind
of
a
--
the
minutest
kind
of
a
burden
that
a
court
might
place
upon
an
employer
in
that
circumstance
as
to
the
fact
that
a
subjective
attitude,
not
based
upon
any
fact
at
all
in
the
record,
except
truck
following
which
is
permissible
under
federal
law.
based
upon
that
single
instance,
the
court
then
did
try
to
say
that
this
might
have
infected
the
relationship
between
morton
and
wilson
in
that
this
may
have
meant
--
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
why
morton
did
not
have
enough
drivers
to
service
wilson.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
the
court
below
thought
that
this
was
not
lawful
under
--
under
ohio
common
law.
i
--
i
don't
know
that
there
was
ever
a
finding
that
it
was
unlawful.
mr.
david
previant
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
held
a
number
of
times
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief
that
following
a
truck
per
se
and
even
truck
--
picketing
the
truck
at
the
time
it
arrives
at
its
destination
does
not
violate
any
provision
of
the
federal
law.
of
course,
if
the
following
is
attended
by
other
incidence
which
might
tend
to
detract
from
the
peaceful
aspect
of
this
kind
of
procedure,
then
there
would
be
another
problem.
but
the
board
has
held,
court
says
so,
that
following
a
truck
in
and
of
itself,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
particular
place
to
which
that
driver
is
going,
so
that
the
union
may,
at
that
place,
has
a
--
has
a
right
under
the
law,
either
make
a
direct,
personal,
peaceful
appeal
to
the
customer
which
this
truck
is
servicing
or
it
even
may
picket
that
truck
while
it
is
there
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
public
and
the
people
on
those
premises
that
this
particular
truck
is
operated
by
a
strikebreaker
or
a
non-union
man.
there's
--
there's
--
therefore,
nothing
in
the
record,
unlawful
or
improper
which
would
support
any
finding
that
there
was
some
element
of
illegality
at
morton
or
in
the
following
of
the
truck
which
gave
to
this
single
man
a
fear
that
there
maybe
trouble
and
this
is
the
only
nexus,
the
only
kind
of
a
relationship
that
can
be
pointed
to
in
this
record
as
being
the
basis
for
the
court's
flat
holding
that
it
would
total
the
damages
which
flowed
from
the
unlawful
activity
and
the
damages
which
flowed
from
the
clearly
lawful
activity
and
assessed
all
of
those
damages
against
the
union.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
doubt
that
it
--
it
may
have
been
lurking
in
some
record
here
but
i
--
i
could
not
say
specifically
that
it
has
been
brought
here.
at
this
point,
i
could
not
say
that
it
has.
it
--
it
may
had
been
an
element
in
other
cases
which
have
been
brought
here
but
it
was
never
an
element
--
mr.
david
previant
--
which
was
called
directly
to
the
attention
of
this
court
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
david
previant
the
recent
amendments
said
--
mr.
david
previant
no,
no
and
there
--
the
recent
amendments
did
not
change
that
law
in
that
respect
--
mr.
david
previant
--
insofar
as
the
board
and
the
lower
courts
are
concerned.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
there's
been
no
suggestion
as
far
as
i
know
by
either
the
board
or
the
lower
courts
that
those
recent
amendments,
in
anyway,
would
inhibit
a
following
of
a
truck
for
the
purpose
of
determining
where
the
--
this
truck
employer
is
doing
business.
i
think
this
is
considered
as
a
--
as
a
wholly
peaceful
and
legitimate
activity,
as
i
say,
where
it
attended
as
in
some
cases
in
the
lower
courts
you
have
a
close
following
of
trucks,
a
--
some
traffic
hazard
involved
and
maybe
some
attempt
by
the
use
of
a
truck
to
cause
an
incident,
i
would
think
then
that
it
would
be
within
the
competence
of
the
states
to
handle
that
matter
as
they
do
all
violence
or
matters
relating
to
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
--
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
previant
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
this
is
a
--
we
believe
this
has
been
a
policy
which
has
been
followed
rather
consistently
by
the
sixth
circuit,
although
most
of
the
sixth
circuit
cases
were
violence
cases.
it
says
in
this
case,
if
there
is
state
illegality,
whether
it
is
violence
or
not,
we
see
no
reason
why
there
should
not
be
an
independent
assessment
of
damages
based
upon
that
state
illegality.
mr.
david
previant
there
is
that
affirmative
finding
that
--
that
--
as
i
say
for,
in
this
court,
there
is
a
suggestion
for
the
first
time,
going
beyond
this
one
instance
of
a
fear
of
violence,
there
is
a
suggestion
in
this
court
that
there
was
some
mass
picketing
initially
before
the
state
court
issued
its
temporary
restraining
order.
the
record,
and
we
have
set
it
forth
again
in
our
reply
brief
here,
is
only
that
while
there
may
have
been
some
25
strikers
in
the
area
of
the
primary
place,
the
striking
was
--
the
picketing
was
carried
on
only
by
or
two
or
three
strikers
at
a
time
and
after
a
court
temporary
restraining
order
issued
by
the
ohio
court,
the
--
the
number
of
pickets
was
kept
to
those
--
to
those
which
has
been
abolished
by
the
ohio
court
and
that
is
the
two
at
--
at
each
inference.
the
lower
court
nor
the
circuit
court
made
any
suggestion
that
mass
picketing
constituted
that
violence
or
threat
to
public
order
which
would've
justified
assessing
on
the
basis
of
ohio
law.
the
other
account
that's
involved
here,
the
so-called
launder
account,
does
--
was
not
--
the
activities
there
were
not
found
to
be
in
violation
of
section
303
at
all.
this
poses
again
a
major
question
before
this
court.
we
believe
--
we
don't
believe
it's
for
the
first
time
however.
in
the
launder
account,
a
direct
request
was
made
by
the
union
to
mr.
launder
to
stop
doing
business
with
morton
during
the
strike.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
would
be
--
i'd
be
willing
to
concede
for
this
purpose
that
he
is.
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
unlawful
that
if
this
might
be
termed
as
threat,
is
a
threat
which
a
union
might
make
to
a
man
who
is
going
to
go
through
a
union
picket
line.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
that
element
of
the
case
entered
into
the
court's
finding
of
--
of
illegality
in
the
conduct
of
the
union.
mr.
david
previant
no,
no,
i
think
--
i
--
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
court's
findings
that
--
that
they
were
concerned
with
this
fear
at
least
--
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
they
--
as
i
read
the
record,
they
attribute
the
damages
that
wilson,
that
this
man
had
the
fear
that
if
he
went
to
work,
he
maybe
followed
and
if
he
is
followed,
there
maybe
trouble,
therefore,
he
wont
go
to
work.
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
that
were
the
theory,
it
would
be
more
remote
and
even
the
--
the
one
we
are
discussing
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
previant
oh,
he
didn't
say
a
personal
injury.
he
said,
“i
feared
my
card
would
be
pulled.”
now,
this
is
a
--
is
the
vernacular
that
if
you
are
a
union
man
and
you
do
something
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
union
standards,
they
would
revoke
your
membership
in
the
union.
that's
what's
known
as
pulling
the
card.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
suggestion
that
this
mr.
kennedy
threatened
him
with
violence.
they
just
said
that
what
will
happen
to
you,
will
happen
to
any
strikebreaker
who's
a
member
of
the
union.
you
will
be
tried
within
the
union
for
conduct
unbecoming
a
union
officer
and
undoubtedly
your
membership
card
will
be
revoked.
today,
this
is
no
longer
a
serious
threat
because
of
the
federal
law
which
says,
“card
or
not,
you
cannot
be
removed
from
your
job.”
mr.
david
previant
well,
again,
i
--
i
would
say
this
would
make
no
difference
at
all
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
illegal
conduct
or
whether
it
was
an
illegal
threat.
or
that
it
suggested
that
anything
which
is
contrary
to
either
state
or
federal
law
would
follow
that
kind
of
action.
well,
this
launder
account,
total
$8700,
that
again
as
i
say,
it
is
clear
that
it
has
--
has
not
alleged
either
below
or
here
that
mr.
launder
cancelled
his
contract
with
mr.
morton
for
any
reason
other
than
he
was
advised
by
the
union
that
there
was
a
strike
and
he
did
not
do
business
with
mr.
morton
during
the
strike.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
is
a
303
violation
but
it
is
urged
here
that
this
mere
request
to
the
employer
is
a
violation
of
the
state
secondary
boycott
law,
common
law.
we
challenge
that
but
we
have
not
made
any
issue
of
it
because
as
we
read
the
cases
cited
by
counsel,
a
mere
request
to
an
employer
does
not
violate
the
ohio
case
law.
we
think
that
the
ohio
case
law
talks
about
coercive
activities
directed
to
the
so-called
neutral.
in
this
case,
however,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
request
to
mr.
launder
was
a
violation
of
the
ohio
common
law
and
therefore,
the
damages
in
that
instance
could
also
be
attributed
to
the
union
and
the
union
would
have
to
pay
that.
now,
in
addition
to
all
of
these,
the
court,
the
trial
court
assessed
punitive
damages
having
found
that
at
least
three
of
these
instances
violated
state
law,
as
well
as
federal
law.
it
applied
the
law
of
punitive
damages
in
ohio
which
rose
out
of
activities
which
are
malicious
or
tortuous.
having
found
that
the
launder
account,
even
though
not
a
violation
of
section
303,
resulted
from
a
violation
of
ohio
law,
it
opposed
this
total
$15,000
punitive
damages.
so
your
total
damages
here
are
some
$34,000
and
if
we
were
to
give
to
the
record
the
fullest
weight
which
may
have
to
do,
there
was
actually
$1600
in
damages
as
a
violation
of
section
303.
all
other
elements
of
damages
grow
either
out
of
this
totality
of
effort
rule
or
out
of
the
alleged
violation
of
ohio
law.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
precisely,
true.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
would
--
would
had
then
$1600
at
a
maximum.
in
this
instance,
if
we
were
to
assume
that
the
schoen
account
upon
which
--
the
o'connel
account
upon
which
the
$1600
was
assessed
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
303.
mr.
david
previant
that
is
our
position
here.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
in
the
context
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
non-violent,
peaceful
activity
which
comes
either
within
the
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
rule
or
within
that
area
which
may
not
be
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
but
when
--
within
the
area
which
the
--
the
congress
has
obviously
occupied
to
the
exclusion
of
state
action.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
--
i
think
the
problem
i
would
have
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
the
enmeshed,
the
use
of
the
term
"enmeshed".
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
think
that
whatever
can
be
segregated
out
as
violence
under
state
laws
relating
to
the
breach
of
the
peace,
the
union
would
have
to
pay
for
understate
standards.
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
that's
right.
now,
whether
it's
a
--
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
pendent
jurisdiction
or
whether
the
action
is
brought
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
david
previant
it
would
not
be
the
basis
of
a
damage
award
under
303.
there
would
have
to
be
the
federal
action
under
303
to
which
is
attached
a
state
action
involving
violence
or
in
that
area
which
this
court
has
said,
the
states
are
still
free
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction
but
if
there
is
no
303
involvement,
this
then
becomes
purely
a
state
matter
under
state
law
and
would
never
reach
even
the
federal
courts
unless
there
was
a
diversity
case.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
--
well
--
unless
--
mr.
david
previant
303
maybe
brought
in
the
state
of
federal
court
but
for
--
mr.
david
previant
a
power
--
a
powerful
remedy.
i
--
i
think
that
is
probably
so.
i
--
this
is
a
--
i
must
confess
that
i'm
as
confused
of
the
--
i
think
most
--
mr.
david
previant
--
law
professors
are
--
mr.
david
previant
--
in
--
on
what
is
jurisdiction
and
what
is
power.
there
was
state
court
litigation
in
this
case
and
it
has
this
significance
that
ultimately,
a
damage
action
in
the
state
court
based
upon
state
common
law
was
dismissed
on
motion
by
the
state
court.
the
state
court
acknowledging
that
under
garmon,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
pursue
and
to
afford
a
remedy
in
the
state
court.
this
--
this
makes
it
--
makes
it
very
interesting
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
now
that
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
state
court
has
itself,
withdrawn
from
the
case,
saying
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
if
we're
here
on
pendent
jurisdiction,
we
may
give
the
remedy
which
the
federal
law
precluded
the
state
court
from
giving.
i
don't
know
how
seriously
that's
argued,
i
--
and
i
don't
know
that
we
would
ever
have
to
get
to
that
point
in
this
case
if
we
are
right
on
some
of
the
preliminary
points.
the
--
mr.
david
previant
i
think
this
--
this
court
has
held,
i
think,
in
a
vigorously
contested
opinion
that
laburnum
was
a
violence
case.
mr.
david
previant
oh,
you
mean
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
but
the
question
arose
in
garmon
after
303,
i
believe
and
in
that
case,
i
believe,
the
majority
of
the
court
felt
very
clearly
that
the
original
decision
of
this
court
was
based
upon
violence
while
i
believe
that
dissenter's
thought
that
there
were
other
elements
in
the
laburnum
case
which
did
not
make
it
fairly
stated
a
violence
case.
but
i
--
i
think
that
since
that
time,
this
court
has
consistently
treated
laburnum
as
russell
and
others,
as
cases
involving
local
disorders
and
local
breaches
on
the
please
--
of
the
peace
which
the
congress
never
intended
to
interfere
with,
if
there
was
some
state
vindication
of
--
of
such
wrongs.
the
court's
–
of
course
our
starting
point
is
garmon
and
we
think
garmon
and
subsequently,
found
garner
rule
of
this
case.
garmon,
for
the
--
after
the
--
this
court's
rule
that
injunctive
relief
would
not
lie
in
the
state
court
for
picketing
activities
directed
to
an
employer
from
whom
the
union
was
seeking
recognition,
damage
would
not
--
damage
action
which
--
would
not
lie
either
because
as
was
i
think
obvious
to
this
court
that
you
could
not
do
by
indirection
through
(inaudible)
in
damages
that
which
the
court
has
held
was
within
the
exclusive
competence
of
the
labor
board
and
that
this
would
be
merely
a
way
of
getting
around
that
particular
rule
of
the
court
in
the
first
garmon
case.
but
if
we
start
at
launder
now,
we
--
we
have
a
case
which
admittedly
did
not
fall
within
section
303,
i
think
that
is
conceded.
at
the
time
that
this
happened
and
i
believe
today,
a
request
to
an
employer
for
his
cooperation
in
connection
with
the
dispute
which
the
requesting
union
is
having
with
that
employer's
supplier
or
customer
is
not
a
violation
of
section
303.
this
was
so
stated
in
the
carpenters
case
and
was
so
stated
last
week
by
this
court
in
servette
when
the
problem
came
before
this
case
as
to
the
extent
of
the
new
amendments
as
they
deal
with
requests
made
to
managerial
employees.
and
this
court
said
at
that
time,
that
neither
before
1959
nor
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
since
1959,
since
the
new
amendments,
this
kind
of
appeal
was
not
intended
to
be
made
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
would
read
that
this
court
has
really
said
that
it
is
a
protected
activity.
the
argument
is
made
here
for
the
first
time,
it
was
never
raised
below,
that
when
you
make
a
direct
appeal
to
an
employer,
since
we
concede
that
it
is
not
prohibited
under
303,
the
respondent
would
urge
that
it
is
not
protected
under
section
7
and
that
therefore,
it
falls
within
that
area
which
is
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
and
therefore,
it
is
at
large
as
far
the
states
are
concerned.
now,
this
is
the
argument,
i
say,
that
is
made
here
for
the
first
time.
we
think
the
very
obvious
answer
is
that
if
it
isn't
protected,
it
is
certainly
arguably
protected
that
this
is
a
concerted
activity
in
support
of
the
primary
strike
and
that
it
would
come
under
the
right
to
mutual
aid
and
protection
which
is
found
in
section
7.
we
read
the
carpenters
case
as
saying
that,
although
respondent
reads
the
carpenters
case
as
saying
it
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
in
the
carpenters
case,
of
course,
it
was
not
a
problem
of
whether
it
was
an
unfair
labor
--
it
was
problem
whether
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
not
a
problem
whether
it
was
a
protected
right.
the
--
and
we
believe
that
this
court's
statement
in
servette
just
referred
to
and
the
cases
which
we
have
referred
to
in
the
--
in
our
brief.
they
make
it
clear
that
it
falls
within
the
area
of
arguable
protection.
i
would
say
it
falls
in
the
area
of
protection
that
it
--
that
arguably
is
even
necessary
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions.
i
would
call
the
attention
that
even
in
the
garmon
case,
although
the
court
was
divided
on
the
full
extent
of
the
prohibited
protected
rule,
the
facts
in
garmon
were
that
there
was
truck
following,
unless,
perhaps,
i'm
going
to
have
to
amend
the
statement
i
made
earlier
that
i
didn't
recall
a
particular
case,
that
there
was
some
truck
following
in
garmon.
and
i
believe
that
the
dissenting
opinion
in
garmon,
said,
nevertheless,
while
it
disagreed
with
the
majority
on
the
application
of
the
preemption
rule
stated
by
the
majority,
it
concurred
in
the
result
in
garmon
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
minority,
that
action
was,
at
least,
arguably
protected.
the
action
was
--
took
place
in
garmon.
so
we
think
that
actually,
and
again,
as
i
would
like
to
amend
my
earlier
statement,
i
--
i
did
forget
that
there
was
--
it
was
not
raised,
it
was
not
an
element
again
as
i
--
as
i
say,
i
think,
i
have
to
be
honest
to
say
that
this
court
didn't
consciously
say,
“we
believe
that
following
a
truck
is
lawful.”
but
that
element
was
in
the
garmon
case
in
the
lower
court
and
this
court
in
garmon,
applying
the
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
rule,
said
that
the
state
could
not
assess
damages
and
the
minority
--
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
surely.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
in
--
in
servette
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
as
--
as
the
court
will
surely
recall
in
servette,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
inducement
to
managerial
help
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
was
covered
by
the
secondary
boycott
provision
which
inhibited
inducement
to
employees
to
stop
working.
this
court
said
that
this
wasn't
inducement
to
exercise
a
managerial
judgment
and
therefore,
it
did
not
come
within
the
amended
law.
but
in
saying
so,
this
court
said
and
--
and
this
is
at
page
4,
that's
the
opinion,
"such
an
appeal
would
not
had
been
a
violation
of
paragraph
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
before
1959,"
which
is
when
this
case
occurred.
mr.
david
previant
oh!
excuse
me,
a
direct
request
by
a
union
representative
to
mr.
launder,
the
opening
of
the
--
the
owner
of
the
company,
not
to
continue
to
do
business
with
mr.
morton
while
the
strike
was
on.
mr.
david
previant
that
is
the
fact.
now,
i
will
say
that
on
two
occasions,
respondent
tried
to
show
that
a
company,
in
that
fact,
was
a
threat
of
picketing.
this
was
ruled
out
incompetent
and
is
not
in
their
record
for
any
purpose
in
this
case,
but
i
would
think
that
there,
you
would
clearly
have
then
a
303
question
at
least
under
present
law.
you
would
not
have
had
it
even
then
under
19
--
before
the
1959
amendments
because
again,
as
this
court
has
recently
reviewed,
before
1959,
you
could
both
persuade
and
threaten
a
neutral.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
well
--
mr.
david
previant
there
--
there
is
no
threat.
yes.
i
--
i
say
the
record
and
i
--
and
i
say
this
because
i
would
hope
that
--
that
when
the
record
is
reviewed,
it
is
--
it
is
more
than
mine
that
although
there
two
suggestions
that
there
was
going
to
be
picketing
at
mr.
launder's.
the
proper
testimony
was
rejected
and
neither
the
lower
court
nor
the
appellate
court
referred
in
anyway
to
any
threat
of
that
kind
to
mr.
launder
as
supporting
any
judgment
which
it
entered
which
embraced
damages
at
the
launder's
establishment.
they
--
they
admit
that
this
is
a
clear
simple
request
to
mr.
launder
to
stop
doing
business.
they
acknowledged
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
section
303.
they've
urged
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
ohio
secondary
boycott
law
and
therefore,
it
is
subject
to
damages
because
it's
within
an
area
which
is
neither
protected
nor
prohibited.
we
also
argue
in
our
brief
that
--
and
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
that
far
that
whether
it
is
protected,
that
even
if
it
were
not
protected
or
prohibited,
it
still
falls
within
that
very
narrow
band
of
cases
which
are
within
the
field
which
congress
occupied
because
this
activity
is
so
close
and
so
necessary
to
the
entire
process
of
collective
bargaining
and
that
even
if
you
could
not
point
to
a
specific
case
saying
it's
protected
nor
to
a
specific
case
saying
it's
prohibited,
nor
the
ones
saying
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited,
it
is,
nevertheless,
within
that
large
area
of
labor
management
relations
which
has
been,
we
believe,
completely
occupied
by
the
congress
that
to
permit
the
states
to
operate
in
this
area
would
be
to
(inaudible)
that
which
congress
has
done
in
this
area.
the
--
i
think
i've
already
covered
principally
the
--
the
wilson
account.
that
was
the
launder
account
which
was
based
wholly
on
ohio
law
--
oh,
there
--
there
is
also
in
--
in
connection
with
the
launder
account,
the
suggestion
of
--
of
violence
that
might
support
even
though
it
is
not
a
303
but
might
be
--
make
it
a
--
a
state
but
as
i
pointed
out,
neither
the
one
witness
who
testified
with
respect
to
truck
following
nor
the
record
with
respect
to
the
number
of
pickets,
nor
even
findings
below
with
respect
to
the
number
of
pickets
would
justify
any
finding
that
launder
was
in
anyway
attended
by
any
act
of
violence
or
a
threat
of
violence
which
would
justify
state
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
damages.
and
of
course,
i've
already
pointed
out
that
if
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction,
it
couldn't
possibly
be
that
a
federal
court,
under
a
theory
of
pendent
jurisdiction,
can
do
that
which
federal
law
would
prohibit
the
state
from
doing.
the
totality
of
conduct
rule
is
probably
the
next
one
that
should
engage
our
attention
and
i
think
i've
already
pointed
it
out
that
this
cisco
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
been
generally
cited
as
a
case
which
hold
that
where
you
have
both
the
legal,
the
lawful
and
the
unlawful,
you
may
then
assess
damages
for
both.
i
think
the
cisco
case
can
be
read
that
way
or
it
can
be
read
as
saying
that
the
court
found
that
because
of
all
of
the
secondary
activities
away
from
the
jobsite,
we
had
a
right
to
assume
that
even
the
activities
at
the
jobsite
were
directed
towards
secondary
objectives
and
therefore,
we're
assessing
total
damages,
but
which
ever
way
it
can
be
read,
we
believe
that
the
court
below
certainly
has
no
basis
in
federal
law
or
state
law
in
holding
that
you
--
you
look
at
the
total
picture
if
it's
lawful
plus
unlawful,
there's
a
totality
of
effort
by
the
union
here,
we'll
take
the
--
the
effort
in
the
legal
field,
we'll
take
the
effort
in
the
unlawful
field
and
we'll
lump
those
damages
together.
this
would,
of
course,
place
a
--
a
possible
burden
upon
the
exercise
of
--
of
--
mr.
david
previant
right.
mr.
david
previant
i
--
i
believe
that
is
the
--
the
case
that
is
generally
considered,
the
source
of
the
rules.
some
courts
have
not
followed
it.
we
think
that
the
sixth
circuit
is
following
it,
except
that
in
this
case,
the
sixth
circuit
never
referred
to
it
specifically.
they
referred
to
the
old
--
to
the
story
parchment
case,
which
i
think
is
the
confusion
between
a
--
a
lumping
of
damages
and
a
question
of
how
do
you
ascertain
damages.
now,
story
parchment
didn't
say
that
if
there
is
a
tortfeasor,
you're
going
to
lump
all
of
the
damages.
it
--
all
it
said
was
if
you
cannot
separate
out
the
damages
which
the
tortfeasor
caused
from
other
damages,
the
tortfeasor
cannot
be
heard
to
complain
that
he
is
being
mistreated
because
he
is
the
one
who
started
it
in
the
first
place.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
problem.
there's
no
problem
of
separating
out
damages,
there's
no
question
about
what
happened
at
wilson.
there's
no
question
about
the
primary
strike
at
morton
and
therefore,
under
any
reading
of
the
story
parchment
case,
there
should
be
no
problem
in
the
lower
courts
to
--
to
attribute
damages
to
those
activities
which
are
unlawful.
unless,
i
say,
by
this
amazing
(inaudible)
of
this
one
fellow
who
might
be
followed,
who
then
might
have
something,
now
has
a
subjective
fear
and
therefore,
he
--
mr.
david
previant
i
will
--
mr.
david
previant
no,
i
would
--
i
would
not
accept
any
reading
of
the
cisco
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
i
--
mr.
david
previant
--
i
think
it's
bad
law.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
considered
by
--
mr.
david
previant
--
by
the
board
and
by
the
courts.
mr.
david
previant
well,
i
would
hope
so.
but
actually,
the
--
the
rationale
of
the
board
initially
in
--
in
the
truck
following,
very,
very
early
in
the
board's
history,
it
was
a
refrigerated
truck
that
came
over
from
--
from
brooklyn
to
new
york
and
they
said
that
these
people
are
actually
doing
business
on
their
truck,
that
is
the
primary
site.
and
it
is
our
position
that
anybody
in
the
trucking
business
can't
do
business
anyplace
else
but
on
his
truck
and
therefore,
we
may
follow
that
truck,
we
may
see
where
it's
going,
we
may
then
picket
when
we
find
it
and
i
don't
think
that
the
board
holds
to
the
contrary.
i
think
for
a
while
under
washington
portfolio,
there
were
some
question
but
the
board
reversed
that
rule
itself
and
the
board
now
adheres
to
what
i
believe,
i
have
fairly
stated
here
to
be
the
rule.
the
only
other
problem,
which
i
don't
think
should
be
a
problem,
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court,
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
can
now
tax
lawful
activities
with
state
punitive
damages.
now,
the
law
is
clear,
section
303
is
clear
that
it
is
only
for
damages
sustained
by
the
injured
party
as
a
result
of
303
violations.
punitive
damages,
historically,
are
not
damages
in
that
sense,
they
are
penalties,
they
are
punishments,
it's
marked
money.
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
what
you
get
for
being
a
bad
boy
sort
of
an
idea.
it
is
not
damages
and
we
can't
conceive
of
any
--
of
any
theory
where
you
have
activities
which
are
arguably
within
the
303
area
that
punitive
damages
maybe
assessed
by
a
state
court.
again,
we
say
that
this
would
be
merely
another
not
so
indirect
method
of
destroying
or
at
least
limiting
federal
rights
which
have
been
given
to
working
men
by
the
federal
laws.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
few
minutes
i
left,
thank
you.
mr.
david
previant
if
the
court
please,
i'd
just
like
to
take
a
--
a
moment
to
direct
myself
to
the
point
as
to
whether
or
not
the
picketing
threat
is
in
this
record.
it
is
true
that
at
page
111
when
the
objection
was
first
made,
the
court
sustained
only
part
of
the
objection.
at
page
114
--
well,
at
page
113,
the
objection
has
then
again
made
that
there
was
no
identification
of
the
person
who
had
made
the
telephone
call
mentioning
picketing
and
at
page
114,
counsel
for
the
union
again
says,
“may
we
have
a
motion
to
strike
that
testimony
on
the
grounds
stated,"
and
the
court
says
that
objection
will
be
sustained.
then
you
get
to
page
161
at
which
point
again
it
has
stated
that
there
was
some
talk
about
a
strike
at
a
service
morton's
truck.
again,
counsel
for
the
union
objects,
again,
the
court
sustains
the
objection.
we
get
to
both
the
--
to
the
findings
of
fact,
which
were
drafted
by
counsel,
at
the
direction
of
the
lower
court
at
page
273
in
which
the
launder
problem
is
discussed
and
all
that
is
found
by
the
court
at
that
point,
this
is
finding
of
fact
8
(d)
--
8
(b),
excuse
me,
that
during
the
course
of
the
strike
and
in
violation
of
the
restraining
order,
defendant
contacted
the
management
of
launder
&
son,
inc.
and
asked
that
plaintiff's
truck
not
be
permitted
to
work
on
such
job
during
the
strike.
i
think
the
record
is
very
clear
that
any
such
testimony
is
not
in
the
record,
have
further
urged
that
if
it
is,
that
is
but
one
isolated
remote
incident
which
would
never
support
any
finding
here
that
under
ohio
common
law,
this
union
is
to
be
taxed
for
the
total
damages
there.
one
further
point
with
respect
to
this
wilson
thing,
the
lower
court
strangely
enough
says,
"how
can
you
connect
it
up,
speaking
of
wilson,
with
a
situation
like
that,
where
there
are
no
illegal
acts
performed,
there
have
any
direct
connection
with
his
contract
with
wilson
for
his
inability
to
fulfill
it?
i
think,"
court
is
continuing,
"i
think
it
is
so
remote
that
it
requires
some
mental
gymnastics
to
connect
the
matter
up.
you
may
proceed
with
it
subject
to
striking."
i
think
it's
tribute
to
counsel
here
that
ultimately,
the
court
did
consider
it
as
an
element
of
damages
but
i'm
sure
that
it
could
not
have
been
on
the
basis
suggested
here
of
mr.
taulve
subject
to
fear.
i
think
that
ultimately,
it
had
to
be
connected
up.
it
was
not
connected
up.
the
court
at
the
time
it
came
in
did
not
believe
that
it
was
all
connected
and
the
court,
certainly,
in
our
opinion,
had
to
apply
a
totality
rule
there.
i
will
deal
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
clerk,
who
i
understand
has
a
problem.
thank
you.
