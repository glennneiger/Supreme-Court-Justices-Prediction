mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
approach
this
case
from
a
standpoint
of
analyzing
the
various
damage
awards
and
their
various
parts
and
discuss
them
with
respect
to
those
that
were
awarded
under
the
federal
law
and
then
under
the
state
law.
as
mr.
previant
has
said,
one
element
of
damages
was
awarded
as
a
result
of
morton's
damages
at
the
o'connel
customer's
plant.
o'connel
was
a
ready
mixed
concrete
manufacturer
and
morton
for
many
years,
had
been
supplying
the
sand
for
that
operation.
now,
a
few
days
after
the
strike
and
when
the
primary
picket
line
at
morton's
premises
proved
ineffective
to
accomplish
the
desired
result,
the
teamsters
union
embarked
upon
a
program
of
secondary
activity
and
here,
we
find
that
a
teamster
business
agent
went
to
the
o'connel
premises
and
talked
to
an
employee.
who
did
he
talk
to?
he
talked
to
a
union
steward,
who
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
same
union,
as
we
are
here
concerned
with.
the
teamsters
union
local
20
represented
the
employees
of
that
secondary
employer
and
the
business
agent
said
to
the
steward,
“we
don't
want
you
to
use
morton's
trucks,
we
don't
want
you
on
--
to,”
he
said
in
effect,
“we
don't
want
you
to
unload
morton's
trucks
until
the
strike
is
settled.”
now,
we
contend
that
was
a
proscribed
inducement
under
section
303.
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act
said
at
that
time
that
it's
unlawful
for
a
labor
union
to
encourage
or
induce
the
employees,
plural,
of
a
secondary
employer
to
refuse
to
handle
goods
or
perform
services
for
the
purpose
of
causing
that
secondary
employer
to
stop
doing
business
with
this
truck
employer.
so
this
union
steward,
the
employee
of
our
customer,
reported
this
immediately
to
his
supervisor,
the
management
of
the
customer.
the
manager
then
testified
that
upon
hearing
this,
he
terminated
morton
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
because
--
because
he
did
not
want
labor
trouble
for
his
company
and
it's
conceded
that
if
damages
were
properly
awarded,
the
damages
were
$1600.
now,
the
teamsters
union
has
said
two
things
here
as
to
why
this
was
not
a
303
violation.
on
one
occasion,
it
has
been
suggested,
i
don't
think
in
this
argument
but
in
the
brief,
that
there
was
an
encouragement
of
but
one
employee,
the
union
steward,
whereas
the
act
itself,
required,
at
that
time,
inducement
or
encouragement
of
employees,
plural.
we
--
we
cited
in
our
brief
two
circuit
court
decisions
which
reasoned
that
if
the
particular
employee,
if
the
only
employee
that
is
contacted
is
the
steward
of
the
employees
of
the
customer
who
can
recently
be
expected
to
convey
the
request
or
demand
to
his
fellow
employees
that
this
is,
in
fact,
an
inducement
of
employees
and
we
so
argue
here.
secondly,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
employer,
o'connel,
the
customer,
terminated
morton
of
his
own
volition,
that
no
concerted
work
stoppage
by
the
customers'
employees
actually
took
place.
we
point
to
the
statute
which
proscribes
an
inducement
or
encouragement.
and
we
--
we
say
the
record
is
clear
that
there
was
this
inducement,
this
encouragement
and
that
it
was
effective
even
without
the
actual
work
stoppage,
it
had
its
intended
effect.
so
we
say,
therefore,
that
it's
clear
that
this
constitute
a
303
violation
for
which
damages
were
properly
awarded.
now,
we
come
then
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
if
this
case
were
decided
under
the
amended
provisions,
which
it
is
not,
of
course,
we
would
find
here
an
inducement
of
the
union
steward
employee
of
o'connel
who
did
not
have
any
managerial
capacity.
therefore,
as
i
read
servette,
it
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
therefore,
the
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
think
very
much
different,
sir.
here
we
had
--
here
--
here
we,
in
fact,
do
have
an
inducement
of
a
person
who
does
not
have
managerial
capacities.
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
accomplish
the
desired
result
by
going
to
management
rather
than
causing
picketing
there,
i
think
makes
no
difference.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
punitive
damages,
i
think,
was
overall
and
was
specified
separately,
of
course.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
the
punitive
damage
award
was
specified
separately.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that
was
not
stated
in
--
in
those
words
that
clearly
but
i
think
from
the
overall
testimony
of
the
manager,
he
understood
that
was
the
danger.
he
did
not
--
the
manager
of
o'connel,
after
listening
to
his
employee,
testified
that
he
did
not
want
labor
trouble
for
his
company,
the
--
the
customers'
company.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
definitely,
because
the
teamster
business
agent
had
said
to
his
employee,
"we
don't
want
you
to
unload
this
sand."
that
--
that
has
a
real
meaning,
real
significance
and
i
think
it
was
pretty
clear.
now,
we
proceed
to
the
element
of
damage
that
was
awarded
because
of
the
totality
of
efforts
rule.
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
demonstrate
later
that
there's
nothing
at
all
new
about
this
but
let
us
explain
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
totality
of
the
effort
and
the
word
"effort"
refers
to
the
legal
efforts
and
the
illegal
efforts.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
think
mr.
previant
is
correct
that
the
ninth
circuit
coined
that
phrase
but
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
show
that
there's
nothing
new
about
it.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
about
the
phrase,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
think
so.
it's
a
new
name
for
an
old
practice.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
there's
nothing
new
under
the
sun.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
alright
let's
--
let's
go
into
that
for
a
moment.
let's
--
let's
assume
that
we
have
a
situation
where
damages
have
been
caused
as
--
as
the
courts
found
damages
have
been
caused
by
a
combination,
by
a
combination
of
lawful
and
unlawful
activity.
that
was
--
that
was
the
finding
here.
morton
lost
the
wilson
job
as
a
result
of
a
combination
of
two
things,
the
primary
picket
line
and
the
unlawful
secondary
activity.
now,
an
old
principle
of
damages
that
is
where
it's
impossible
to
ascertain
the
amount
of
actual
damages
because
of
something
that
the
wrong
doer
has
done,
courts
will
award
the
total
damages.
this
--
this
has
occurred
in
several
situations,
so
let
me
refer
to
two.
let's
suppose
that
--
that
i
make
a
--
a
product.
let's
suppose
it's
a
mousetrap.
i
--
i
put
my
own
material
and
my
own
labor
into
it
and
then
i
give
it
a
name
which
happens
to
be
protected
by
a
trademark
and
let's
suppose
that
i
am
--
that
i
am
sued
for
my
profits.
now,
this
--
this
court
has
had
before
that
type
of
situation.
the
story
parchment
case
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon,
in
turn
relied
upon
the
hamilton
shoe
case
which
is
240
u.s.
and
referred
to
on
page
19
of
my
brief.
and
there
the
--
it
was
said
that
the
inherent
impossibility
of
an
--
of
an
apportionment
between
the
profits
attributable
to
the
use
of
a
simulated
trademark
and
those
attributable
to
the
intrinsic
merit
of
the
infringer's
product
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
not
charging
the
owner
of
a
trademark
when
suing
the
infringer
with
the
burden
of
showing
what
part
of
the
latter's
profits
were
attributable
to
the
use
of
the
infringing
mark,
especially
where
the
infringement
was
not
innocent.
and
the
court
in
that
case,
in
turn,
referred
to
a
situation
involving
a
wrongful
confusion
of
goods.
and
at
page
262
of
the
hamilton
brown
shoe
case,
the
court
said
that
this
is
the
same
principle
which
is
applicable
to
a
confusion
of
goods.
if
one
wrongfully
mixes
his
own
goods
with
those
of
another,
so
that
they
cannot
be
distinguished
and
separated,
he
shall
loose
the
whole
for
the
reason
that
the
fault
is
his
and
it
is
but
just
that
he
should
suffer
the
loss
rather
than
an
innocent
party.
so
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
truck
drivers
fail
to
report
to
work.
morton
was
damaged
because
he
did
not
have
enough
truck
drivers
report
to
work
and
why
didn't
they
report
to
work,
partially
because
of
the
lawful
activity
and
partially,
because
of
the
unlawful
activity.
a
particular
truck
driver
who
failed
to
report
to
work
probably
knew
about
both
activities
and
perhaps,
they
both
played
the
part
in
his
deciding
not
to
work.
how
is
the
respondent
to
show
the
actual
damages?
now,
i
--
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that
--
that
last
part
is
--
is
not
correct,
sir.
the
only
element
of
damage
that
was
awarded
under
this
rule
was
the
wilson
account
which
was
suffered
as
result
of
not
having
enough
truck
drivers.
now,
on
the
same
point,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
damages
were
not
awarded
as
a
result
of
the
strike
as
a
whole
which
--
which
might
--
which
might
be
an
extension
of
the
totality
of
efforts
rule.
let's
look
at
a
couple
of
situations.
one
element
of
damages
admittedly
suffered
by
morton
as
a
result
of
the
strike,
but
not
awarded
at
all
here,
was
damages
flowing
from
a
loss
of
a
job
for
the
seneca
county
engineering
department.
there,
the
engineering
department
of
seneca
county
learned
about
the
strike
and
terminated
morton.
now,
here,
of
course,
morton
suffered
these
damages
because
of
the
strike,
he
would
have
had
the
work,
he
would
have
made
the
profit,
had
it
not
been
for
the
strike,
but
of
course,
the
--
the
court
--
the
court
did
not
award
this
element
of
damages
to
the
respondent
because
he
did
not
lose
this
element
of
damages
as
a
result
of
not
having
truck
drivers
and
not
having
truck
drivers
because
of
the
combination
of
illegal
and
legal
activities
is
why
the
wilson
award
was
made.
so
with
respect
to
the
seneca
county
matter,
that
was
lost
simply
because
the
customer
learned
about
the
strike
and
terminated
morton.
now,
that
was
properly
not
awarded,
of
course.
now,
with
respect
to
launder,
we're
going
to
come
to
launder
in
a
greater
detail
in
a
moment,
but
let's
look
at
the
totality
rule
as
applies
to
launder.
in
the
launder
situation,
the
record
shows
that
these
profits
were
lost
because
of
an
approach
by
the
union
to
the
customer,
launder.
this
element
of
damages
was
not
lost
as
a
result
of
not
having
enough
trucks
available.
trucks
were,
in
fact,
on
the
job.
damages
there
were
awarded
for
a
different
reason
which
we
shall
come
to.
so
the
point
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that
this
old
concept
of
damage
law
was
applied
only
to
the
one
situation
where
damages
flowed
directly
from
a
--
from
not
having
enough
trucks
available
and
it
was
the
question
of
why
were
there
not
enough
trucks
available
that
the
court
addressed
itself
to
and
--
and
applied
the
story
parchment,
the
hamilton
shoe,
old
line
of
damage
cases
as
well
as
referring,
of
course,
to
the
ninth
circuit
cisco
case.
now,
we
submit,
therefore,
that
these
two
elements
of
damages
maybe
affirmed
under
section
303.
there
were
section
303
violations.
what
were
the
damages?
there's
one
element
for
o'connel
where
there
was
an
approach
to
the
secondary
employee
and
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
think
it
is
a
--
a
narrow
reading
of
the
record.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes.
i
think,
mr.
justice
goldberg
would
agree
with
me
that
--
that
the
keyword
is
the
word
"use"
on
page
122.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
--
i
interpret
that
word
to
mean
what
it
--
what
it
had
been
meaning
in
the
context
of
the
o'connel-morton
situation.
that
context
was
that
morton
was
hauling
the
sand
into
o'connel's
and
o'connel
was
using
morton's
trucks
to
receive
sand
by
and
the
union
did
not
want
o'connel
to
continue
to
use
morton's
trucks
in
that
sense.
of
course,
o'connel's
employees
had
not
driven
morton's
trucks.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
i
--
no,
i
--
i
think
not,
but
the
union
steward
was
seeking
a
situation
whereby
the
employees
of
o'connel
would
stop
working
with
the
sand
that
was
brought
in.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
i
--
i'm
certain
that
the
lower
courts
agreed.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir
and
further,
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
didn't
have
to.
he
immediately
told
his
supervisor
as
he
said
and
that's
all
it
took.
and
--
and
as
i
previously
said,
it's
the
inducement,
the
encouragement
of
such
--
of
--
of
concerted
refusal
to
work
with
the
sand
that
is
proscribed.
it
--
it
is
not
required
that
it
actually
take
place
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
well,
no
one
is
threatened
to
strike
him
direct
but
i
--
i
think
he
was
reasonable
in
interpreting
the
communication
to
the
union
steward
as
a
warning
of
possible
trouble.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
that's
correct.
i
believe,
mr.
majors,
the
supervisor
at
--
of
o'connel
also
testified
that
he
did
not
want
any
trouble
at
his
plant
and
that
followed
by
the
contact
to
his
employee
steward
was
--
was
effective.
now,
we
will
proceed
to
the
common
law
elements
here,
one
of
compensatory
damages
and
one
of
punitive
damages.
several
questions
were
asked
by
the
court.
i
like
to
refer
to
one
of
them
now.
the
court,
with
good
reason,
i
think,
has
inquired
about
violence
here
and
threats
of
violence
and
what
part
that
played
in
the
lower
courts.
i
think
it'd
be
helpful
to
keep
in
mind
that
four
or
five
or
six
cases
had
previously
been
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
involving
similar
situations
with
one
admittedly
important
difference.
that
was
the
meadow
creek
and
other
cases,
i
believe,
cited
on
page
30
of
the
brief.
meadow
creek
was
the
first
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
where
the
--
where
state
law
was
applied
to
grant
punitive
damages
and
also
compensatory
damages.
in
those
cases
of
actual
violence
what
--
was
certainly
involved,
but
i've
indicated
in
my
brief
by
page
citations
to
each
of
those
cases
in
the
sixth
circuit
where
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
punitive
--
punitive
damages
did
not
depend
upon
violence
rather
punitive
damages
could
be
awarded
as
a
result
of
a
malicious
civil
conspiracy
and
so,
this
case,
in
the
district
court,
follow
that
case.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
that
actual
violence
or
violence
or
threats
of
violence
were
necessary
to
support
the
application
of
state
law
nor
the
award
of
punitive
damages
and
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court,
of
course,
says
the
same
thing.
however,
we
must
--
we
must
look
to
garmon.
mr.
justice
goldberg
inquired
about
garmon
and
the
effect
of
it
upon
laburnum
and
this
comes
directly
to
our
argument
for
the
support
of
state
common
law
here.
in
--
in
garmon,
at
page
247
of
359
u.s.,
the
court
said,
"it
is
true
that
we
have
allowed
the
states
to
grant
compensation
for
the
consequences
as
defined
by
the
traditional
law
of
torts
of
conduct
marked
by
violence
and
imminent
threats
to
the
public
order,"
citing
russell,
laburnum
and
youndahl.
the
court
continued,
“state
jurisdiction
has
prevailed
in
these
situations
because
of
the
compelling
state
interest
in
the
scheme
of
our
federalism
in
the
maintenance
of
domestic
peace”
and
this
is
now
overridden
in
the
absence
of
clearly
express
congressional
direction.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
go
to
what
i
contend
are
threats
to
the
public
order
in
this
case.
there
were
--
there
was
no
actual
violence
that
is
conceded
but
i
say
that
if
there
were
threats
to
the
public
order
that
that
is
sufficient.
now,
when
the
primary
picket
line
was
not
sufficient
to
accomplish
the
desired
results,
the
teamsters
union
engaged
in
a
program
of
following
morton
truck
drivers
who
did
go
to
work.
let's
--
let's
look
at
that
activity.
the
work
involved
required
an
employee
to
alone
drive
a
dump
truck
from
morton's
premises
at
the
edge
of
tiffin,
ohio
to
various
gravel
pits
located
some
distances
out
in
the
country,
of
course,
along
rural
country
roads.
so
the
record
shows
that
these
truck
drivers
would
go
out
to
these
--
along
the
gravel
pits
be
loaded
with
sand
and
then
get
back
on
the
heavily
traveled
highways
and
go
on
to
the
customer's
construction
site
or
where
he
was
stock
piling
the
material.
now,
these
load
of
truck
drivers
were
occasionally
followed
by
carloads
as
many
as
five
men
in
a
--
in
a
truck
or
--
or
in
a
car
following
the
truck.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
that
following
per
se
is
not
illegal
and
i
would
not
quarrel
with
that.
i
--
i
say
it's
a
question
of
fact.
the
--
the
employee
--
the
--
the
union
has
a
right
to
know
under
certain
circumstances
where
the
--
this
truck
employer
is
working
and
--
so
that
he
can
picket
there
under
rather
narrowly
proscribed
rules.
but
it
certainly
does
not
take
a
carload
of
pickets
following
one
truck
to
find
out
where
the
truck
is
going.
i
say
it's
a
question
of
fact.
if
the
--
if
the
striking
union
wants
to
know
where
the
employer
is
working,
of
course,
in
the
first
case,
he
--
he
could
ask
him
and
if
information
were
refused,
alright,
let
him
follow
him,
perhaps,
in
--
in
one
car
with
--
with
one
driver
or
two,
but
there's
certainly
no
need
for
whole
carload
of
it
on
these
various
occasions.
now,
what
was
the
effect
of
this
following?
the
union,
of
course,
derides
this
witness
who
testified
that
he
had
fear
for
his
personal
safety,
but
this
one
witness
had
the
courage
to
say
that
he
was
fearful
for
his
personal
safety
and
that
was
not
discredited.
it
was
definitely
credited
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
observed
this
witness
and
observed
the
cross-examination
and
made
specific
reference
in
the
finding
of
facts
and
in
his
opinion
to
the
fact
that
this
particular
employee
was
fearful
for
his
personal
safety.
now,
i
--
now,
i
think
we
must
contrast
that
type
of
threat
to
the
activity
that
occurred
in
the
russell
case
and
the
youngdahl
case
which
this
court
in
the
garmon
case
specifically
said
involved
the
types
of
threats,
not
violence,
threats
to
the
public
order
that
would
justify
application
of
state
law.
now,
in
russell,
i
referred
to
on
page
33
of
our
brief
and
the
citation
for
which
is
356
u.s.
634.
it
appeared
that
a
state
court
had
awarded
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
in
a
total
amount
of
$10,000
for
the
union,
by
intimidation
but
not
by
actual
physical
violence,
denied
a
worker
access
to
a
plant
during
a
strike.
there,
there
was
a
primary
picket
line,
an
employee
who
was
not
striking
wanted
to
go
to
work,
he
was
confronted
by
some
pickets
who
said
that
if
he
was
a
salaried
worker,
he
could
go
in,
if
he
was
a
non-salaried
worker,
he
could
not.
he
was
in
his
automobile.
he
was
satisfied
that
he
couldn't
get
through
peaceably
and
so
backed
off
and
returned
home
and
eventually,
lost
about
$500
in
wages,
the
brief
shows
and
the
state
court
awarded
a
total
of
$10,000
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
and
this
court
said
that
punitive
damages
that
constitute
a
well
settled
form
of
relief
under
the
law
of
the
state
here
in
alabama,
where
there
is
a
willful
and
malicious
wrong
and
to
the
extent
that
such
relief
is
penal
in
nature,
it
is
all
the
more
clearly
not
granted
to
the
board
by
the
federal
acts.
the
power
to
impose
punitive
sanctions
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
but
not
within
that
of
the
board.
and
then
in
--
in
youngdahl,
which
was
also
approved
in
garmon,
that
case
approved
an
issuance
of
a
state
court
injunction
and
for
our
purposes
here,
if
it's
proper
to
apply
state
law
to
grant
an
injunction,
it
is
to
award
damages.
there,
at
355
u.s.
131,
this
court
approved
issuance
of
a
state
court
injunction
to
the
extent
that
it
enjoined
a
striking
union
that
had
not
engaged
in
actual
violence
against
conduct
consisting
of
verbal
insults
and
name
calling,
that
was
calculated
to
provoke
violence.
there,
there
was
a
primary
picket
line
and
name
calling
was
--
was
engaged
in.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
comparison
of
the
activities
in
russell
and
youngdahl
with
this
--
with
the
situation
in
our
case.
in
russell
and
youngdahl,
the
activity
took
place
on
the
primary
picket
line.
the
individual
in
each
case
directly
involved
did
not
testify
that
he
was
concerned
for
his
personal
safety
and
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
suggested
that
there
was
any
reason
for
such
a
concern
and
contrast
that
with
our
situation,
where
the
courts
below
have
credited
taulve's
testimony,
had
found
that
he
did
harbor
a
genuine
fear
for
his
personal
safety.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
i
think
that
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
that
the
lower
courts
found
that
this
resulted
in
this
truck
driver
being
fearful
for
his
safety
and
therefore,
not
returning
to
work.
if
he
--
if
he
had
fear
for
his
safety,
i
think
he
was
menaced.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
there
was
a
specific
finding
that
the
following
of
the
trucks
caused
this
driver
to
be
fearful
for
his
safety.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
well,
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
white,
would
have
to
be
decided
within
the
framework
of
the
russell
case.
that
is
the
case
where
there
was
a
primary
picket
line
and
the
employee
who
was
not
striking
tried
to
go
in
and
it
was
rebuffed.
and
there
--
there,
this
court
did
award
compensatory.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
citing
russell
by
way
of
comparison.
i'm
saying
that
our
situation
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
but
not
--
but
not
fearful
of
crossing
the
primary
picket
line,
which
i
understood
your
question
to
be
directed
at.
not
at
--
he
was
not
fearful
of
simply
crossing
the
primary
picket
line,
but
being
followed
miles
and
miles
into
the
countryside
and
i'm
saying
that
if
a
--
if
a
state
law
can
be
applied
to
a
situation
where
a
person
is
merely
fearful
of
crossing
the
primary
picket
line,
surely,
it
can
be
applied
to
a
situation
that
involves
what
is
expected
to
happen
after
he
crosses
and
leaves.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
what
event?
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
being
rebuffed
--
being
rebuffed
in
a
sense
of
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
alright.
in
the
russell
case
the
rebuff
was
that
he
was
told
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
enter.
i
think
that
was
it.
in
the
morton
case,
the
fact
is
that
he
actually
saw
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
but
he
knew
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
but
taulve
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir.
but
he
knew
to
what
distances
they
were
followed.
he
knew
under
what
circumstances
they
were
followed
by
how
many
and
where,
and
he
knew
what
his
situation
would
be.
i
think
actions
here
again
speak
louder
than
mere
words.
he
knew
what
--
what
the
action
would
likely
be
and
he
was
fearful
of
the
consequences.
so
i
think
the
comparison
of
--
of
this
type
of
activity
justifiably,
his
foundation
for
finding
here
of
an
imminent
threat
to
the
public
order
which
would
be
within
the
exception
of
garmon.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
others
did
not?
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
he
had
a
few
but
he
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes.
he
--
he
had
those
not
all
at
once.
that
--
that
was
the
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
ultimate
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
--
ultimately,
yes.
this
fear,
i
think,
was
not
at
that
time
but
--
but
earlier.
it's
true
that
all
did
not
harbor
this
fear
--
this
fear
but
others
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
well,
perhaps,
it
should
not
be
and
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
it
should
not
be
but
the
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
i
don't
believe
so.
i
--
and
i
could
answer
that
definitely
not.
the
lower
court
carefully
used
the
word
"employee",
in
the
singular.
now,
this
caused
one
employee
to
be
fearful
for
his
safety.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
the
wilson
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no.
the
--
the
court
considered
these
things.
it
considered
this
following,
this
fear
of
this
one
person.
it
also
considered
the
fact
that
there
was
secondary
picketing
going
on
at
other
customer's
plants
which
the
drivers
who
went
to
work
would
observe.
the
court
also
considered
the
fact
that
the
secondary
activity
must
have
had
something
to
do
--
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
yes,
sir.
but
the
ones
that
stayed
away
knew
what
was
going
on.
they
knew
that
those
who
did
go
to
work
were
followed
that
they
encountered
secondary
pickets
at
--
at
these
stockpiles
way
up
in
the
country,
ohio
highway
construction
products
--
ohio
highway
construction
projects.
and
the
court,
i
think,
properly
took
into
consideration
that
the
primary
picket
line
must
not
have
been
sufficient
and
that
the
secondary
activity
must
have
taken
a
part
because
of
the
fact
that
the
secondary
activity
was
engaged
in.
now,
a
second
reason
for
the
propriety
of
applying
state
law
here
is
totally
self-sufficient
unto
itself
without
regard
to
the
youngdahl,
russell
line
of
cases
where
it
threats
the
public
order
but
not
actual
violence
is
involved.
here,
we
say
that
the
particular
activity
complained
of
was
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
by
the
act.
now,
let's
demonstrate
what
the
activity
complained
of
was.
here,
i
am
only
speaking
about
the
activity
whereby
launder
was
pressured
into
terminating
morton's
trucks.
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
correct
a
--
a
statement,
which
i
believe
needs
correcting,
as
to
the
pressure
that
was
applied
to
launder.
mr.
previant
suggested
that,
and
i'm
referring
to
page
111
of
the
record,
that
when
the
manager
or
supervisor
of
customer,
launder,
was
testifying,
he
testified
that
there
had
been
some
threat
of
a
picket
line
and
at
that
reference
to
the
--
a
threat
of
a
picket
line
was
ordered
out
of
the
testimony.
now,
on
page
111,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
launder
supervisor
is
being
questioned
about
the
contact
by
teamster
agent,
larry
evans
and
the
question
was,
"what
did
he
ask
you?"
and
the
answer
was,
"if
there
were
morton
trucks
on
the
job."
"what
did
you
tell
him?"
"yes."
"what
did
he
say
to
you
then?"
"well,
he
asked
just
a
minute.
there
was
something
about
a
picket
line
he
mentioned
if
we
continued
to
use
them."
now,
i
want
to
make
the
point
here
that
this
answer
was
allowed
to
stand.
literal
went
on
to
say
something
about
a
restraining
order,
then
the
objection
was
made
to
the
restraining
order
and
the
court
said
the
answer
pertaining
to
the
restraining
order
may
go
out.
now,
i
--
i
trust
that
is
a
proper
correction.
mr.
previant
can
refresh
my
recollection.
mr.
m.
j.
stauffer
no,
sir,
page
111.
it's
our
position
here
that
there
was
a
threat
to
this
customer
of
picketing
at
his
premises
and
that
that
was
the
reason
that
he
terminated
morton
resulting
in
these
damages
here.
now,
i
would
look
particularly
at
that
activity
which
is
complained
of
here
because
we
have
taken
great
pains
in
--
in
our
brief
to
analyze
the
many
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
the
labor
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
point
out
that
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
activity,
the
specific
activity
complained
of
there
was
protected
or
prohibited
or
at
least
arguably
so.
here,
the
activity
complained
of,
the
threatening
of
a
customer
with
the
picket
line
in
his
premises
was
not
prohibited
by
the
act
in
1956.
i
think
as
a
result
of
the
tree
fruits
case,
then
it
would
be
prohibited
now
because
as
i
read
that
case,
that
was
decided
last
week,
now
proscribed
as
pressure
which
is
designed
to
bring
pressure
on
a
secondary
employers
business
generally,
not
just
on
the
primary
employers
product.
here,
the
threat
was
against
the
secondary
employers
business
generally.
other
suppliers,
other
truckers
would
not
come
in
an
order.
now,
of
course,
the
specific
activity
complained
of
was
not
prohibited.
of
course,
if
it
were,
we
could
recover
these
damages
under
303
itself,
so
that
takes
care
of
the
prohibited
part.
now,
was
it
protected?
we
want
to
refer
to
section
7
for
after
all
if
this
activity
was
protected,
it
was
protected,
as
mr.
previant
submits,
under
section
7,
but
we
say
that
the
history
of
that
section,
as
--
as
this
court
had
said,
was
to
prevent
states
from
treating
otherwise
the
lawful
activity
as
an
illegal
conspiracy
when
--
where
undertaken
by
several
persons
to
aid
unionization.
in
other
words,
prior
to
1947,
union
activity,
otherwise
lawful,
was
sometimes
held
to
be
unlawful
simply
because
it
was
undertaken
in
concert
and
section
7
had
the
effect
of
removing
that
concerted
weapon
from
the
states.
but
this
court
has
said
in
the
briggs-stratton
case,
336
u.s.,
"but
because
legal
conduct
may
not
be
made
illegal
by
concert,
it
does
not
mean
that
otherwise
illegal
action
is
made
legal
by
concert."
we
say
that
this
type
of
activity
was
unlawful
under
the
common
law
long
before
section
7
was
adopted.
our
cases
in
common
law
(inaudible)
go
back
more
than
50
years
and
because
it
was
unlawful
when
section
7
was
adopted
and
because
section
7
did
not
have
a
purpose
of
making
unlawful
activity
lawful,
this
activity
was
not
protected.
further,
we
say
that
this
activity
was
not
protected
because
of
the
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
this
type
of
activity
in
1947
was
intended
to
be
prohibited.
we're
talking
about
the
difference
between
a
failure
to
prohibit
and
an
affirmative
protection.
senator
taft's
off
quoted
statement
is
that,
"our
committee
heard
evidence
for
weeks
and
never
succeeded
in
having
anyone
tell
us
any
difference
between
different
kinds
of
secondary
boycotts.
so
we
have
so
broadened
the
provision
dealing
with
secondary
boycotts
as
to
make
them
an
unfair
practice."
now,
we
say
that
it's
clear
that
section
7
was
intended,
intended
i
say,
to
prohibit
this
but
it
is
clear,
of
course,
that
inept
language
was
used
to
do
so
and
since
then,
the
courts
have
continually
referred
to
the
loopholes
in
section
7.
that
was
referred
to
in
1959
by
then
senator
john
kennedy
when
he
said
that
the
chief
effect
of
the
conference
agreement,
therefore,
with
respect
to
landrum-griffin,
will
be
to
plug
loopholes
in
the
secondary
boycott
provisions.
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
about
the
desirability
of
plugging
these
artificial
loopholes.
so
our
argument
here
is
that
activity
which
the
congress
failed
to
outlaw,
that
failure
to
outlaw
cannot
reasonably
be
turned
into
an
affirmative
protection.
the
--
the
question
is
whether
state
law
can
properly
be
applied.
if
it
can
be,
it
doesn't
appear
the
much
serious
argument
but
that
the
launder
award
and
the
punitive
damage
award
based
upon
the
state
common
law
were
correct
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
award
below
should
be
affirmed.
