justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
this
question
of
following
the
trucks
ever
been
brought
here
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
previant,
may
i
ask,
on
--
on
this
chapter,
you
said
that
before
this
union
court
might
impose,
attributed
the
belief
that
something
said
to
him
by
what's
happening
with
kennedy,
who
you
said
he
thought
was
one
of
the
union
representatives,
was
kennedy
a
union
representative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
it's
been
imposed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
probably
mean
that
he
feared
personal
injury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
position,
i
gather,
is
the
ohio
law
violations
can
have
not
--
at
least
these
violations,
may
not
--
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
within
the
liability
in
the
303.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
if
there
is
any
liability
in
the
303
at
all,
it
has
to
be
limited
to
those
violations
of
303
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
permits
the
assessment
of
damages
which
in
this
instance,
you
suggest
was
seeking
16
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
--
but
your
--
your
position
also
is
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
that
no
damages
would
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
--
may
i
ask
mr.
previant,
this
--
as
for
this
record,
i
understand
your
position,
is
this
have
to
be
a
pure
hypothetical,
but
if
any
of
these
ohio
law
violations
had
been
enmeshed
with
violence,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
take
that
away.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
the
offensive
--
in
the
joiner
sense
of
violence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
--
in
a
303
suit,
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
--
that's
really
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
would
even
that,
in
your
view,
be
the
basis
for
a
damage
award
under
303.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
so
if
the
state
of
the
law
the
time
was,
then
nlrb
decisions
although
we'd
never
dealt
with
it
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would've
made
it
arguably,
i
--
i
haven't
read
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nlrb
cases
you
cite,
but
apparently
they
had
said
that
following
a
truck
on
itself
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
thing,
mr.
previant,
you
referred
to
servette.
i
--
i
gather
that
--
is
the
303
language
--
it
is
the
--
it
almost,
in
terms,
the
same
as
what
we
dealt
with
in
servette?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
such
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
what
is
it
that
you
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
facts
here
as
comparable
to
what
we
dealt
with
in
servette?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
speaking
of
the
facts
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
had
authority
to
exercise
that
discretion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
what
is
the
fact
circumstance
here
which
is
comparable
to
a
fact
situation
we
had
in
servette?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
--
the
--
that
is
one
of
the
facts
here,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
remember
in
servette,
the
threat
did
not
result
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
only
because
of
the
proviso,
the
8
(b)
(4).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
telling
us
now,
the
threat,
if
there
was
a
threat
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
not
part
of
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
--
mr.
previant,
are
you
arguing
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
cisco
case
rather
than
the
primary
picketing
site
by
reason
of
the
outside
activity
becoming
secondary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
indeed
that
the
following
is
itself
merely
an
extension
of
the
primary
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
asking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
asking
if
you're
arguing
that
following
the
trucks
is
really
no
different
from
the
extension
of
the
primary
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
get
some
--
you
might
get
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
some
of
the
things
we
said
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stauffer,
did
--
is
there
evidence
that
the
union
--
o'connel
union
steward
told
his
supervisor
that
he,
the
steward,
would
see
to
it
that
o'connel
employees
did
not
handle
goods
delivered
in
morton's
truck?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
you
say,
suggests
that
he
thought
that
if
he
didn't
cut
off
morton,
his
own
employees
would
not
handle
goods
delivered
on
morton's
truck.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
coined
that?
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
old.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
