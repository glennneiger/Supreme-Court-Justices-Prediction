justice
hugo
l.

why?
why
do
say
we
could
hold
it
applicable
to
the
state
of
texas
and
not
the
other
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
a
state
law
however.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
little
different
with
the
other
argument
because
(inaudible)
as
i
understood
it,
we
must
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
and
the
fourteenth
requires

of
the
state
of
texas
which
does
not
require
many
other
states,
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
fourth
and
fourteenth
or
whatever
it
consist
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black

that's
a
state
law

hugo
l.

to
enforce
the
state
statute,
different
than
the
way
the
supreme
court
says
it
should
be
enforced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
was
that?
