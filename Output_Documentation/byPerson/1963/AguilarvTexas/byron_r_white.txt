mr.

let's
assume
that's
an

have
received
information
from
an

now,
that

that
--
that's
(inaudible)
isn't
it,
of

(inaudible)
justice

well,
that's
a
quite
a
bit
different
when
he
says
he
had
seen
it.
that's
--
that's
a
personal

personal
knowledge
or
personal
information.
and
what
if
the

what

the

did
said,
"i

he's
given
a

information

he
doesn't
say
whether
the
informant
saw
it
or
heard
it
or
what.
justice

but
he
would
agree
that
if
he
had
said
in

based
upon
personal

i
believe
that.
justice

but
what

what
kind
of

i
see
in
the
record
here
that
some,
it's
on
page

there
is
some
indication
that
the
office
setup
is
available

what
was

that
was
inquired
into

any
further

what
kind
of
surveillance
is
that?
justice

well,
the
state
seems
to
rely
to
some
extent
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
surveillance,
what
if
there
must

so
this
is
all
there
is
about
