mr.
clyde
w.
woody
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
application
of
the
mapp,
giordenello
and
ker
decision
from
this
court,
the
application
of
the
fourth,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
they
apply
in
criminal
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
facts
briefly
are
this.
nick
aguilar
was
arrested
by
virtue
of
a
combination
of
search
and
arrest
warrant
on
january
the
8th,
1960.
this
was
a
combined
federal
and
state
undertaking.
there
were
two
federal
officers
present
and
participated
in
the
search
and
the
arrest.
there
were
also
about
six
state
officers
who
also
participated
in
the
arrest
and
search.
according
to
the
state's
evidence,
the
two
police
officers,
on
or
about
january
the
8th,
1960,
received
what
they
described
in
court
as
reliable
information
from
a
credible
source,
that
nick
aguilar
would
have
some
heroin
in
his
possession
at
his
--
at
his
home.
they
went
to
judge
regan
who
was
justice
of
harris
county.
they
piped
out
a
--
an
affidavit
and
a
search
warrant
prior
to
going
to
judge
--
justice
regan.
justice
regan
executed
the
affidavit.
he
took
the
affidavit
and
executed
the
--
or
gave
them
the
search
warrant.
they
proceeded
to
aguilar's
home
out
in
houston.
there,
they
knocked
on
the
door.
there
was
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
they
said
they
were
police
officers.
they
did,
however,
--
one
--
one
of
the
officers
said,
"we
knocked
on
the
door.
we
heard
some
activity
inside."
they
made
a
forced
entry
and
acting
pursuant
to
the
arrest
portion
of
the
warrant.
they
run
through
the
home
and
collared,
and
the
defendant
took
him
into
custody
in
the
bathroom
where
they
said
they
found
that
he
was
attempting
to
flush
the
contraband
down
the
commode.
they
recovered
it.
this
was
the
extent
of
the
evidence
introduced
in
the
case.
the
defendant
was
tried
the
first
time
in
february
of
1960.
the
case
was
reversed
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
he
was
tried
the
second
time
in
1962,
i
believe
it
was,
in
the
state
court
in
june
of
1962.
a
motion
for
rehearing
was
filed
latter.
then
in
july
the
3rd,
a
second
motion
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
november
of
1962
or
rather
it
was
overruled
in
november
of
1962.
in
the
meantime,
the
federal
authorities
had
also
indicted
him.
and
in
january
of
1962,
he
was
put
to
trial
for
the
same
offense
in
federal
court.
however,
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
he
was
acquitted
in
the
federal
court
but
he
was
not
sentenced.
he
was
convicted
in
september,
if
i
--
my
recollection
serve
me
correctly,
and
he
was
not
sentenced
until
the
following
january.
in
the
meantime,
the
federal
prosecution
was
about
to
begin
on
january
the
22nd.
our
main
complaint
here
and
we
--
we
complained
in
the
trial
court
that
this
particular
affidavit
and
warrant
wherein
derogation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
did
not
to
get
any
real
consideration
from
the
trial
court.
his
remarks
concerning
the
federal
standard
are
on
page
21
of
the
record.
he
--
i
apprised
him
of
the
decision
of
mapp
versus
ohio
from
this
court
and
he
said,
"counsel,
will
you
give
me
some
cases
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
this
matter?"
and
this
was
the
extent
of
his
concern
over
these
federal
issues.
now,
we
--
he
--
the
court
indicated
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
mapp
and
i
tendered
the
decision
to
him
and
i
was
summarily
overruled.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
it's
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
page
21
of
the
record.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor.
the
federal
issue
was
raised
also
when
the
defendant
was
attempt
--
when
the
state
attempted
or
the
judge
attempted
to
sentence
him.
and
again,
at
great
length,
we
went
into
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
affidavit
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
federal
standard
and
whether
or
not,
this
was,
in
fact,
a
writ
of
assistance.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is,
in
fact,
a
writ
of
assistance
that
was
condemned
as
far
back
as
entick
versus
carrington.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
search
warrant
and
particularly
the
arrest
warrant,
and
i'd
like
to,
if
i
may,
read
the
arrest
portion
of
it.
now,
this
is
a
combined
arrest
--
search
arrest
warrant.
and
that
the
arrest
warrant
says
this,
"and
you
are
hereby
further
commanded
to
arrest
the
said
nick
alford
aguilar,
a
mexican
male,
and
others
unknown
to
the
affiants,
the
persons
accused
of
the
unlawful
sale
and
equipment."
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
search
warrant.
it's
on
page
24,
i
believe,
in
the
record,
your
honor,
page
24
to
26,
the
affidavit
and
the
search
warrant.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
the
arrest
warrant
is
on
page
24
of
the
record.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
the
--
it
is
in
the
--
it
is
in
the
search
warrant,
your
honor,
on
page
26.
this
is
a
combined
--
texas
has
a
rather
unusual
procedure
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
--
mr.
justice
goldberg.
they
have
a
combined
document
and
the
first
part
of
it
is
denominated
as
an
affidavit
and
the
second
part
in
the
--
a
search
and
arrest
warrant.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
26
is
the
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
it
is
our
position
that
the
affidavit
here
does
not
comply
and
does
not
conform
to
giordenello
versus
united
states
that
this
court
considered
in
1958
and
the
--
there
is
no
statement
of
the
essential
facts
in
the
affidavit
and
in
the
search
warrant
to
give
the
justice
of
the
peace
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
warrant
in
question.
now,
the
--
the
extent
of
the
probable
cause
and
the
facts
alleged
are
these,
and
this
is
on
page
24
of
the
record,
that
after
the
formal
portions
of
the
affidavit,
it
--
this
is
the
building
house
or
place
of
nick
alford
aguilar,
a
mexican
male,
and
other
person
or
persons
unknown
to
the
affiants
by
name
but
then
they
are
descriptions.
now,
the
--
this
portion
here
that
give
the
name,
your
full
name
or
describe
the
person
accurately
or
state
if
unknown,
is
just
a
--
another
part
of
the
printed
affidavit
that
is
used
in
texas,
is
a
place
where
we
have
reason
to
believe
and
do
believe
that
said
party
so
occupying
and
using
as
a
private
residence,
he
said
building
house
or
place,
has
it
--
in
his
possession
therein
narcotic
drugs
as
that
term
is
defined
below.
and
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
law
and
for
the
purpose
on
the
--
of
the
unlawful
sale
thereof
and
where
said
narcotic
drugs
are
unlawfully
sold,
that
on
or
about
the
8th
day
of
january,
1960.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
printed
portion
of
all
of
the
affidavits.
now,
starting
here
is
the
particular
facts
that
are
alleged
where
the
state
contends
it's
--
that
it
satisfies
the
federal
standard.
the
--
the
affiants
have
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person
and
do
believe
that
heroin,
marijuana,
barbiturates
and
other
narcotics
and
narcotic
paraphernalia
are
being
kept
at
the
above
described
premises
for
this
purpose
of
sale
and
use
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
law.
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
particularly,
this
is
a
general
affidavit.
the
search
warrant
and
the
arrest
warrant
incorporate
the
affidavit
by
reference.
this
gives
the
citizens
no
protection.
it
does
not
protect
the
right
of
privacy
and
incidentally
in
texas,
we
must
by
statute
follow
the
federal
constitution,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
in
the
opinion,
judge
morrison
in
--
on
rehearing,
candidly
admits
this.
he
says,
"yes,
we
are
bound
by
statute
to
follow
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
texas
is
unique
in
this
respect.
we
have
the
greatest
protection
so
far
as
the
statutes
are
concerned
but
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
we
have
any
real
protection
when
it
comes
to
the
right
of
privacy
because
we
are
not
even
allowed
under
our
procedure
to
inquire
as
to
who
these
nameless,
faceless,
unidentified
informers
are.
we
--
the
officer
himself
makes
the
determination
of
probable
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not.
he
would
not
comply
with
the
federal
standard.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
that's
what
the
state
contends,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
well,
your
honor,
they
must
judge
it
by
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit
and
they
might
have
had
other
reasons
but
we
were
not
allowed
to
go
into
it
to
develop
it
because
in
texas,
you
are
not
allowed
to
go
in
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
unlike
the
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
under
the
--
under
the
state's
--
under
the
state's
argument,
it
would
be.
but
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
i
don't
--
under
the
--
under
article
725b
which
is
the
--
which
is
a
modification
of
uniform
narcotic
drug
act,
it
possibly
might
be
sufficient.
certainly,
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
not
hold
it
so
because
they
held
back
in
1927
in
chapman
versus
the
state
that
a
--
an
affidavit
on
information
and
belief
alone
is
insufficient
to
justify
the
issuance
of
the
search
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
do
it.
the
main
reason
that
they
don't
do
it,
i
submit,
is
because
they
don't
have
any
such
personal
knowledge.
and
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
chapman
versus
the
state
your
honor.
it's
in
--
it
isn't
cited
in
my
brief.
it's
296
southwest
at
page
1095.
it
is
the
case
that
--
and
there's
another
one
but
its
way
back.
it's
a
1912
case
landa
versus
obert.
i
don't
--
i've
forgotten
the
style
of
that
one
however,
your
honor.
but
here,
we
--
we
have
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
absolutely
agreeing
with
us
and
agreeing
with
this
court
that
they
must
follow
the
dictates
of
this
court.
they
must
follow
--
they
must
follow
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
article
727a
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
and
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
the
court
because
it
is
unique,
but
it
is
not
followed
probably
at
least,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
been
mistaken
as
to
what
probable
cause
and
statement
of
facts
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
or
under
the
federal
standard.
here
is
the
statute.
no
evidence
obtained
by
an
officer
or
other
person,
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
or
of
this
state,
shall
be
admitted
in
evidence
against
the
accused
on
the
trial
of
any
criminal
case.
surely,
and
the
last
time
this
was
amended
was
in
1953
as
a
result
of
the
case
of
schwartz
versus
texas
where
it
--
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
it
was
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
for
interception
--
wired
intercept
on
the
telephone.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
the
--
the
only
thing
--
the
only
construction
of
this
statute
is
this.
that
almost
immediately
after
this
court
decided
jones
versus
united
states.
that
was
only
28th
of
march,
1961.on
the
27th
of
april,
1961,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
a
unanimous
decision
held
that
jones
was
not
controlling
in
texas.
so
you
cannot
reconcile
the
decisions
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
this
procedural
article
other
than
to
say,
"well,
they're
overlooking."
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
oh,
you
are
--
i
submit
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
you
may
well
be
--
you
may
be
precluded
so
far
as
this
particular
article
is
concerned,
although
they
--
they
say
in
this
very
opinion
here
that
they
are
bound
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
they
readily
admit
that
they
are
bound
by
the
--
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
they're
bound
to
follow
them.
but
they
don't
follow
them.
they
don't
follow
them
because
they
--
because
they
do
not
give
a
realistic
consideration
of
the
substantive
and
procedural
aspects
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
it
may
have
--
they
--
they
have
given
the
same
construction
for
years
and
i
submit
until
this
court
does
something
about
it,
they
will
continue.
now,
this
--
the
way
our
procedure
is
in
texas.
this
particular
procedure
here
where
you
allow
the
state
to
give
a
mere
conclusion
that
they
have
received
from
a
unnamed
and
unidentified
person
information
of
what,
it
doesn't
--
they
don't
have
to
tell
you.
you
go
into
court
and
you
--
you
may
not
go
into
the
affidavit.
you
may
not
go
behind
the
affidavit.
you
may
not
show
there
have
been
such
cases
as
the
hernandez
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
the
court
of
criminal
appeal
have
before
them
the
facts
that
the
--
the
affiants
have
sworn
falsely
to
the
affidavit
and
they
say,
"no,
you
may
not
go
behind
the
affidavit
to
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
you
are
precluded
under
our
statutes
from
doing
that."
now,
i
submit
that
under
giordenello
and
mapp
and
ker
that
we
certainly
should
--
the
court
should
take
a
very
close
look
at
these
affidavits
and
require
the
states
to
follow
them
religiously
due
to
the
fact
that
the
procedural
obstacles
involved
by
the
particular
states
preclude
the
individual
defendants
or
the
people
aggrieved,
the
persons
aggrieved
by
the
execution
of
this
process
of
raising
the
federal
questions
at
all
or
litigating
the
federal
questions
and
this
court
should
take
a
very
careful
look
at
this
affidavit
and
search
warrant
and
declare
them
to
be
wholly
inadequate
when
measured
by
the
federal
standard.
you
cannot
distinguish
this
affidavit
and
this
search
warrant
from
giordenello.
and
there
is
only
one
member
of
the
court,
i
believe,
present
who
dissented
and
that's
mr.
justice
clark
in
giordenello
and
the
remainder
of
the
present
court,
i
submit,
who
were
on
the
bench
at
that
time,
i
submit
that
they
are
--
if
you
will
look
at
this,
you
will
find
that
this
affidavit
is
identical
with
giordenello.
i
know
--
i'm
pretty
familiar
with
giordenello.
i
tried
giordenello
in
the
trial
court
in
the
circuit.
one
of
my
associates
tried
it
here.
but
you
cannot
distinguish
this
case,
this
affidavit
from
giordenello.
there
are
many
other
cases
that
you
can't
distinguish
this
from
either.
many
federal
cases
--
many
cases
from
this
court
that
you
cannot
distinguish
it
from.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
well,
your
honor,
it
--
it's
giordenello
--
actually
they
--
there
was
--
you
--
the
court
alluded
to
rule
3
and
4
and
actually
was
discussed
rule
4
more
than
anything
else.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
but
he
said
--
the
court
said
in
giordenello,
that
it
was
based
on
the
implementing
statutes,
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
which
certainly
implement
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
i
don't
think
we
can
separate
those
two.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
--
i
submit
that
without
the
procedural
devices
of
rule
3
and
4,
the
substance
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
could
not
be
effected
and
that
is
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
has
been
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
rules
and
the
federal
rules
are
federal
statutes.
so
where
this
court
might
have
some
--
might
have
to
pass
on
that
issue
in
other
states.
you
will
not
have
to
pass
on
it
where
texas
is
concerned
because
as
--
as
many
of
the
courts
have
held,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
are
not
mere
procedural
statutes.
these
are
or
these
are
statutes.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
there
are
any
cases
that
--
that
would
suggest
that
rule
3
or
4
go
beyond
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
if
there
are,
i
am
not
familiar
with
them.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
rule
3
and
4
only
is
a
vehicle,
a
device
whereby
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
maybe
realized.
they
do
not
go
beyond
that.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
end
result
of
them
are
applicable
to
all
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
some
similar
--
or
something
similar.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
not
only
3
and
4,
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
it
but
i
--
5
also,
the
prompt
arraignment
thing.
i
think
--
but
i
--
i
think
that
they
are
applicable
to
the
states
or
some
--
the
states
must
--
the
states
must
have
some
provision
whereby
the
--
the
federally
guaranteed
rights
maybe
--
must
be
protected.
and
we
don't
have
it
in
texas.
on
the
--
in
the
--
and
i
submit
that
under
this
decision
from
this
--
from
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
considering
the
procedural
statute
of
the
state
of
texas,
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
must
apply
them
to
all
the
states
but
so
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
surely,
then
it
is
applicable
to
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
because,
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
the
state
legislature
of
texas
has
seemed
fit
to
incorporate
by
reference
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
that
is
a
state
law
and
the
--
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
says
"we
are
bound
to
follow
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states,"
however,
they
say
--
however,
we
disagree,
we
disagree
that
the
--
the
state
--
the
statement
of
facts
in
this
--
in
the
search
warrant
or
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant,
we
disagree
that
this
does
not
satisfy
the
federal
standard.
they
do
not
say
that
they
do
not
--
that
they
would
not
apply
it,
they
just
say
that
they
have
erroneously,
it's
my
position,
that
they
have
erroneously
construed
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
--
i'm
sorry.
if
--
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
it
isn't
the
fourth
amendment
that
requires
it,
it
is
the
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
it
is
the
procedural
statute
of
the
state
of
texas
that
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
--
that
you
--
that
you
enforce
this
particular
procedural
statute
because
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
basis
though
of
whether
or
not
rule
3
and
4
are
absolutely
required
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
although
i
submit
that
they
are.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
you
are
getting
--
there
--
there
are
some
cases
that
are
very,
very
close
to
that
and
i
submit
that
it
is
distinguishable.
the
rugendorf
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
316
f.2d.
this
is
just
about
the
extreme
that
any
court
has
held
where
the
conclusions
are
sufficient
and
in
that
case,
it
was
decided
in
april
1963
by
the
seventh
circuit.
paraphrasing
the
affidavit
is
this.
agent
moore
of
the
fbi
swore
that
in
--
an
informer
had
furnished
reliable
information
in
the
past,
reported
to
the
affiant
that
he
had
seen
80
fur
garments
in
the
defendant's
base
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
you
are
doing
precisely
what
this
court
would
as
since
time
one
--
since
boyd
versus
united
states
said
that
you
could
--
should
not
do
and
that
is
that
the
officer
--
the
affidavit
should
state
sufficient
facts
in
order
for
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
make
his
determination
of
probable
cause.
now,
if
the
officer
tell
--
tells
the
magistrate,
"now,
i
have
information
which
i
believe,"
and
incidentally,
that's
exactly
what
happened
if
you
will
look
at
the
offense
report
in
this
case.
that's
exactly
the
information
that
he
had
in
this
case.
he
said
his
offense,
it's
contrary
to
his
sworn
testimony
but
in
this
case,
the
--
the
officer's
information,
and
it's
on
page
10
and
11
and
61
and
62
of
the
record,
and
it
says
exactly
that."
i
receive
information
from
a
person,"
and
he
believed
that
this
man
had
heroin
in
his
house.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
--
and
based
on
that,
i
went
and
obtained
a
search
warrant
from
the
jp.
this
is
insufficient.
this
does
not
state
facts.
this
only
states
conclusions.
this
does
not
give
the
magistrate
a
sufficient
statement
of
facts
upon
which
he
may
predicate
a
finding
of
probable
cause
to
issue
the
search
warrant
in
question.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
under
these
circumstances,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
distinguishable
incidentally
from
--
from
ker.
this
is
distinguishable
from
draper
because
in
--
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
--
in
--
in
ker,
the
court
will
recall
that
the
--
the
informant
told
them
that
--
or
rather
the
--
the
individual
had
both
heroin
and
also
in
ker,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evidence
introduced
without
any
objection.
now,
in
--
in
mapp
--
oh,
excuse
me,
in
draper,
another
case
of
the
search
--
arrest
without
a
warrant,
there
--
it
was
corroborated.
this
was
not
the
breaking
in
of
his
home.
this
was
not
going
there
in
--
at
night
time
or
in
the
late
evening
and
ransacking
his
house
and
making
a
search.
they
had
some
information
which
had
proven
to
be
credible
and
reliable
in
the
past.
they
went
there.
they
corroborated
it.
in
this
case,
they
didn't
have
anything
except
a
person
who
told
them,
"i
believe
that
this
man
has
heroin
in
his
house."
now,
that
is
insufficient.
if
--
if
we
are
to
--
if
we
are
to
delegate
this
nondelegatable
duty
to
the
police
to
determine
probable
cause,
then
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
has
no
--
has
no
meaning
today.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
i
submit
that
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
--
it's
the
same
and
i
--
i'm
familiar
with
the
cases
that
suggest
that
the
test
for
a
search
warrant
and
arrest
warrant
should
be
identical,
but
i
submit
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
arresting
a
man
on
the
street,
out
in
the
open
and
going
into
his
home
and
invading
his
right
of
privacy,
of
course,
the
other
side
of
that
argument
is
well,
in
the
one
hand,
you
invade
his
goods
in
--
in
his
home
and
the
other,
you
take
away
his
liberty.
but
notwithstanding
that,
i
think
the
greater
--
there
should
be
a
greater
showing
of
probable
cause
to
search
a
man's
home
and
merely
to
--
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
proper
decisions
so
far
as
the
search
of
a
man's
home
is
concerned,
absent
some
extreme
emergency
should
be
a
search
warrant
only.
and
that
is
the
only
probable
cause
absent
some
very
extreme
emergency
that
would
justify
the
search
of
his
home.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
he
would
have
--
i
think
he
would
have
to
state
the
facts.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
if
he
went
to
the
justice
of
peace
and
said,
"i
saw
the
heroin
there,"
then
surely
that's
--
that
is
sufficient.
so
long
as
he
states
facts
in
his
affidavit,
so
that
the
--
so
that
you
have
the
magistrate
between
the
police
and
the
citizens
and
so
that
the
magistrate
may
make
his
own
determination
of
probable
cause
then
surely,
but
not,
let
it
be
own
facts
not
conclusions
and
particularly
where
you
can't
question
that
conclusion.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
your
honor,
that
was
on
my
bill
of
exception.
i
was
attempt
in
--
i
was
attempting
to
go
into
this
proposition
of
the
search
warrant
or
the
--
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
and
the
information
that
he
had.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
no,
your
honor,
i
--
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
they
relied
at
all
on
surveillance
because
the
--
they
must
judge
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
from
the
affidavit
itself.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
this
is
all.
and
this
was
on
my
bill
of
exception.
you
said
the
court
would
--
did
not
even
consider
this.
in
--
rather
than
have
a
--
an
offer
of
proof
in
texas,
you
have
your
bill
of
exception
and
develop
your
--
your
statement
of
--
of
--
under
your
bill.
and
it
was
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
we
may
not
go
into
this
and
it
was
with
an
idea
that
preservation
of
my
federal
questions
that
i
went
into
it
to
the
extent
that
i
did.
the
bill
of
exception
as
such
is
not
considered
by
the
trial
court.
it
is
only
an
--
it
is
only
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
trial
court
may
--
committed
an
error.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
clyde
w.
woody
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thing
that
i
would
like
the
court
to
be
cognizant
of
is
my
position
so
far
as
the
hearsay
is
concerned.
on
page
11
of
my
brief,
i'm
not
--
i
am
not
attacking
this
proposition,
this
affidavit
on
the
constitutionality
of
an
affidavit
based
on
hearsay.
that's
not
my
major
contention.
it
is
that
it
does
not
state
sufficient
facts.
now
the
eisner
case
and
the
rugendorf
case
that
counsel
has
referred
to
do
state
facts
distinguished
from
conclusions.
and
this
honorable
court
in
nathanson
versus
united
states,
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
which
was
reaffirmed
in
jones
versus
united
states,
the
case
that
he
relies
on
here.
and
in
the
nathanson
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
here
is
the
affidavit
which
this
court
held
inadequate
and
insufficient
so
far
as
this
position
is
concerned.
and
here
is
the
affidavit.
whereas,
he
said
francis
b.
laughlin,
has
stated
under
his
oath
that
he
has
cause
to
suspect
and
thus
believe
that
certain
merchandise
to
wit,
certain
liquors
of
foreign
origin
and
more
particular
description
of
which
cannot
be
given
upon
which
is
otherwise
been
bought
into
the
united
states
contrary
to
law.
and
that
said
merchandise
is
now
deposited
and
contained
within
the
premises
of
jj
nathanson,
said
premises
being
described
as
a
two-storey
framed
building
at
117
north
bartram
avenue.
and
the
court
said
this
about
that
particular
affidavit.
it
--
it
went
upon
a
mere
affirmation
of
suspicion
and
belief
without
any
statement
of
adequate
supporting
facts.
the
--
the
court
went
further
to
say
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
officer
may
not
properly
use
a
warrant
to
search
a
dwelling
unless
the
--
it
has
been
issued
upon
probable
cause.
now
the
eisner
case,
there
is
not
--
i
submit
--
is
not
employed
in
the
rugendorf
case
likewise.
now
the
rugendorf
case
which
counsel
has
cited,
the
affidavit
is
thusly.
agent
moore
of
the
fbi
swore
that
an
informer
who
had
furnished
reliable
information
in
the
past,
reported
to
the
affiant
that
he
had
seen
80
fur
garments
on
the
defendant's
basement
a
few
days
previously,
describing
them
as
mink,
otter
and
beaver
jackets
with
labels
removed.and
that
the
informer
had
been
told
the
fur
was
stolen.
now
in
that
particular
affidavit,
the
court
indicated
that
they
did
not
discuss
this
proposition
of
facts,
the
court
merely
said
the
appellant
was
urging
in
the
rugendorf
that
the
affidavit
was
based
on
hearsay
information
and
therefore
was
insufficient.
and
the
same
proposition
was
before
the
court
in
eisner.
now
these
are
of
course
two
different
propositions,
one,
hearsay
and
the
court
has
already
dispose
of
that
proposition
that
under
some
circumstances
possibly,
an
affidavit
may
properly
be
based
on
hearsay.
however,
it
must
state
facts
as
distinguished
from
conclusions
of
law
as
the
--
if
the
giordenello
case
is
still
the
law
of
this
court
and
still
the
law
of
this
land.
and
if
mapp
and
ker
mean
what
they
say
they
mean
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
enforceable
against
the
state
with
the
same
degree
and
to
the
same
extent
that
they
are
enforceable
against
the
federal
courts
then
this
affid
--
instant
affidavit
is
insufficient.
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
to
believe
that
if
a
federal
agent
or
if
the
federal
government
brought
into
this
court,
an
affidavit
and
which
ordered
the
arrest
of
an
individual
and
other
person
or
persons
unknown
and
that
such
process
was
issued
and
executed
and
was
relied
upon
and
that
a
blanket
warrant
such
as
we
have
here
was
utilized.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
almost
--
this
is
very,
very
close
to
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
that
jus
--
that
the
court
considered
in
marcus
that
was
decided
the
same
day
as
mapp.
and
two,
the
justice
--
two
of
the
justices
agreed
without
the
--
without
it
really
being
urged
that
this
was
a
general
warrant.
and
i
submit
that
we
have
before
us
here
a
general
warrant.
it
matters
not
i
submit
that
the
court
has
spoken
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
enforceable
against
the
states
if
you
allow
the
states
the
right
to
say
by
their
legislation,
"yes,
we
will
follow
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
but
interpret
them
in
such
a
manner
that
they
do
not
do
so."
that
is
what
we
have
here
and
i
submit
that
the
proper
procedure
here
would
be
to
reverse
this
cause
and
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
to
spell
out
with
great
particularity
of
certainty
just
what
is
required
in
an
affidavit
and
search
warrant.
counsel
has
suggested
throughout
that
while
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
should
not
be
--
should
not
controlling
on
the
states.
well
as
far
back
as
1926
in
the
olmstead
case
and
in
1915
in
the
weeks
versus
united
states.
long
before
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
were
promulgated,
we
had
the
very
same
application
of
rule
41
which
is
now
rule
41.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
held
in
olmstead
that
it
is
a
--
this
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
fourth
amendment
the
--
a
motion
to
suppress.
now
i
--
i
don't
see
--
i've
failed
to
appreciate
how
imposing
upon
the
states
the
requirement
that
they
follow
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
manner
works
any
hardship
and
this
--
this
argument
of
federalism,
i
submit,
has
no
merit
to
indicate
just
the
--
just
precisely
how
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
confused
the
issues
in
a
very
--
in
one
of
the
cases
that
counsel
cites
in
giacona.
a
dissenting
opinion
there
and
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
read
what
--
one
of
the
judges
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said,
a
man
who's
been
on
that
court
judge
morrison
for
a
very
long
time.
what
we
overlooked
originally
and
what
they
failed
to
give
application
to
on
rehearing
is
the
basic
concept
of
the
right
of
privacy
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
he
underlines
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court,
together
with
the
fact
that
the
opinion
in
mapp,
the
guarantees
of
that
--
of
that
amendment
as
so
interpreted
have
been
extended
to
those
who
are
tried
in
state
court.
now,
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
recognizes
the
fact
that
they
have
not
been
following
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
as
it
is
interpreted
by
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
in
reality,
they
have
not
been
following
a
period.
and
if
the
court
does
not
now
find
that
such
an
affidavit
and
search
warrant
to
be
void
then
mapp
versus
ohio,
ker
versus
california
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
so
far
as
the
states
are
concerned
because
the
states
that
want
to
circumvent
these
particular
statutes
--
these
particular
holdings
will
merely
enact
the
statutes
such
as
texas
has
and
interpret
it
accordingly
and
there
will
be
no
real
protection
and
there
will
be
no
effective
right
of
privacy
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
and
as
has
been
interpreted
by
this
honorable
court.
thank
you
very
much.
