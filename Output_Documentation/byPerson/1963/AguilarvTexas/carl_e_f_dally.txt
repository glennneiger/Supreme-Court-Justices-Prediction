mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
on
many
occasions
as
stated
in
many
of
the
cases
in
search
and
seizure
that
it
is
better
to
place
the
magistrate
between
the
citizens
and
the
officers
who
go
out
to
make
a
search.
of
course,
obviously
in
this
case,
that
is
precisely
what
was
done.
here,
the
officers,
when
they
received
the
information,
they
did
not
embark
upon
a
search
of
their
own
into
a
private
residence.
they
did
not
go
roughshod
through
a
man's
house
as
it
was
done
in
the
case
of
mapp.
but
what
they
did
was
to
seek
out
a
magistrate,
the
justice
of
the
peace
of
harris
county,
texas
and
there,
presented
him
the
affidavit,
which
is
in
the
record,
and
upon
the
binding
of
probable
cause
by
him
and
referred
to
page
26
of
the
record,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
justice
in
--
in
the
warrant
says
that,
"i
am
satisfied
that
the
grant
exist
and
the
probable
cause
is
shown,
and
i
believe
in
its
existence,
i
do
hereby
find."
so
we
come
to
--
the
court
in
this
case,
where
--
is
not
--
it
wasn't
an
unbridled
search,
it
was
made
with
process.
now,
then
the
question,
as
i
see
it,
is
simply
presented
in
this
case.
the
issue
is,
was
a
search
warrant
upon
probable
cause
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
provisions?
and
that
alone
is
what
is
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
speak
of
the
facts
briefly.
after
the
officers
received
the
search
warrant
in
this
case,
they
went
immediately
as
it
will
be
shown
from
the
record,
they
went
immediately
to
the
premises
of
the
petitioner.
and
there,
going
to
the
front
door,
they
knocked
on
the
door
--
someone
answered
from
within,
"who
is
there?"
and
the
officers
told
him
that
they
were
police
officers
and
that
they
had
a
search
warrant
in
their
possession.
no
one
answered
the
door
and
they
heard
some
scuffling
sounds
within
the
house
and
sounded
as
if
someone
was
starting
to
run.
one
of
the
officers
at
that
time
pulled
and
opened
the
screen
door
and
opened
the
inner
door
and
two
of
the
officers
pursued
the
petitioner
through
two
or
three
rooms
of
the
house
into
the
bathroom.
and
there
he
threw
a
cellophane
package
into
the
commode
and
was
flushing
it.
one
of
the
officers
grappled
with
the
man.
the
other
retrieved
the
cellophane
package
from
which
they
took
six
packages
of
white
powder
which
was
later
determined
to
be
a
high
grade
of
heroin.
the
petitioner
was
then
indicted
to
harris
county
grand
jury
and
was
soon
brought
to
trial.
the
first
trial,
he
entered
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere.
in
that
case,
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
reversed
and
the
reason
would
be
that
the
plea
of
nolo
contendere
was
one
which
had
been
made
available
to
defendants
very
recently
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried
and
the
court
had
not
admonished
the
petitioner
of
his
rights
under
that
plea
and
that
was
the
reason
for
its
first
reversal.
he
received
20
years
sentence
in
that
case.
coming
back
to
the
trial
court,
it
soon
tried
again
and
their
plea
of
not
guilty
--
on
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
punishment
of
20
years
was
assessed.
the
case
was
duly
appealed
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
and
although
the
case
was
not
briefed
and
argued
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
its
original
submission,
the
court
did
consider
the
point
which
is
an
issue
here.
judge
belcher,
writing
the
opinion
for
the
court,
found
that
there
were
sufficient
facts
stated
within
the
affidavit
upon
which
--
which
would
show
probable
cause.
the
appellant
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
in
much
more
detailed
discussion
of
this
problem
of
probable
search
or
probable
cause
and
the
unlawful
search,
which
was
asserted
by
the
appellant,
was
made
by
judge
morrison.
there,
judge
morrison
discussed,
and
in
light
of
mapp
versus
ohio,
acknowledged
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
certainly,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
but
he
said
there
wasn't
any
hesitancy
of
the
duty
to
follow
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
citing
cases
there.
and
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
rule
727a
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
texas
in
what
it
means
and
how
it
affects
this
case.
it'd
be
my
position
here
that
it
would
--
would
not
affect
this
case.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
--
it
is
a
procedural
statute.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
determined
its
application
in
texas
and
i
believe
that
this
court
would
be
precluded
for
making
a
different
determination
insofar
as
that
article
is
concerned.
furthermore,
there
would
be
nothing
--
should
this
case
be
decided
upon
the
basis
of
727a
which
mr.
woody
has
indicated
that
he
thinks
could
be
done
and
then
would
make
it
applicable
to
texas
only
perhaps.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
legislature
from
changing
that
rule,
should
this
court
decide
to
decide
it
on
that
basis.
and
furthermore,
as
we've
said,
i
doubt
that
--
that
any
different
construction
could
be
made
even
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
that
particular
statute.
now,
the
petitioner
here
relies
mainly
upon
the
case
of
giordenello
versus
united
states
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1958.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
case
that
it
was
decided
upon
the
basis
of
rules
3
and
4
of
the
code
of
criminal
--
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
question
has
been
asked
as
--
and
there
has
been
some
discussion
as
to
whether
they
include
more
than
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
would
submit
that
there
was
no
reason
to
have
these
rules
if
they
did
not
add
something
to
those
constitutional
provisions.
and
certainly,
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
argued
that
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
have
any
application
to
the
state
courts
in
their
cases.
now,
this
argument,
of
course,
is
made
by
analogy
because
i
believe
it
would
be
rule
41
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
would
apply
where
a
search
warrant
is
obtained
rather
than
an
arrest
warrant,
as
it's
provided
for
in
articles
--
in
--
in
rules
3
and
4.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
they
specifically
held
that.
it's
on
page
87,
i
believe.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
they
did
so
hold.
i
have
to
turn
to
the
page
24,
i
believe
it
is,
where
the
search
--
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
is
located.
there
maybe
some
difficulty
i
think,
it's
been
partially
explained
here
that
this
is
printed
form
or
portions
of
it
are
printed
forms
in
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
appear
upon
the
same
page.
we
would
say
as
it
has
been
suggested
already
that
what
we
said
here
that
the
affiants
have
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person
and
do
believe
that
heroin,
marijuana,
barbiturates
and
other
narcotics,
narcotic
paraphernalia
are
being
kept,
the
above
described
premises
for
the
purpose
of
sale
and
use
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
law
that
it's
a
shorthand
rendition
for
saying
that
they
--
when
they
say
reliable
information,
that
means
from
a
reliable
source
or
reliable
person.
the
term
"credible
person"
means
the
same
thing.
it
would
be
--
i
do
not
know
how
they
could
detail
it.
if
they
did
detail
it
and
describe
the
person,
i
do
not
know
how
it
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference.
and
as
i've
indicated,
there
is
a
disagreement
between
petitioner
and
the
state
in
this
case
as
to
the
application
of
the
rules
--
of
federal
rules
and
criminal
procedure.
we
think
that
the
rules
place
a
higher
standard
on
federal
prosecutions
than
would
the
constitutional
provisions
in
and
of
themselves.
and
as
i've
stated,
i
do
not
know
why
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
rules
if
they
did
not
do
so.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
yes,
your
honor,
they
specifically
considered
that
particular
federal
rule
in
that
portion
that
is
41
(c).
after
a
careful
analysis
of
the
cases
from
this
honorable
court,
i
have
concluded
that
there's
actually
no
case
upon
which
the
petitioner
may
rely
or
upon
which
would
decide
the
precise
issue
that
is
before
this
court.
and
i
think
that,
actually,
that
there
is
an
area
which
this
court
has
not
--
up
to
this
time,
has
not
actually
covered
because
the
giordenello
case,
as
i
tried
to
indicate,
i
believe,
does
not
cover
this
area.
it's
specifically
was
a
federal
prosecution
from
the
beginning.
so
i
think
that
--
that
what
this
court
will
find
necessary
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
actually
go
into
some
new
territory.
now,
the
petitioners
said
here
that
hearsay
is
not
sufficient
to
--
to
establish
probable
cause.
we
know
that
this
contention
has
been
held
against
him
by
the
case
of
draper
and
jones
and
perhaps
other
cases
which
have
held
that
hearsay
is
enough
to
establish
probably
cause.
another
question
that
has
arisen,
what
is
a
standard?
should
there
be
any
different
standard
between
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
one
with
a
warrant,
insofar
as
probable
cause
is
concerned?
if
anything
it
should
require
less
to
obtain
search
warrant
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
indicated,
i
believe,
in
the
case
of
wong
sun,
which
was
quite
recently
decided,
that
we
cannot
be
more
stringent
with
the
requirements
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
than
to
embark
upon
a
search
on
probable
cause
alone
to
--
so
hold
would
be
to
encourage
officers
then
not
to
obtain
search
warrants
but
to
go
ahead
and
embark
upon
their
search
and
run
rough
--
roughshod
over
the
citizen
area
immediately.
now,
there
are
many
practical
problems,
i
think,
that
will
be
involved
in
--
in
the
decision
of
this
case,
as
it's
been
said
that
probable
cause,
as
the
name
implies,
you're
dealing
with
probabilities.
they
are
factual.
practical
considerations
are
involved
and
people
in
their
everyday
work
or
officers
in
their
everyday
work
have
to
make
very
rapid
decisions
and
their
decisions
that
a
reasonably
proved
man
should
make
and
not
as
legal
technicians.
that
wording
has
been
used
in
many
of
the
cases
from
this
court.
now,
i'm
going
to
say
something
that
question
whether
probable
cause
in
such
case
as
this
must
be
shown
from
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit
in
a
state
case.
i
agree
that
this
court
has
so
held
there
and
i
think
it's
been
uniformly
held
in
all
of
the
federal
cases
that
it
must
be
so
shown
in
the
federal
cases
but
that
is
because
of
the
federal
rule
which
requires
that
at
least
stated
in
the
affidavit.
i
know
--
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
there
again,
your
honor,
to
clarify
a
little
bit,
we
do
not
have
motions
to
suppress
in
texas
and
they're
not
recognized
the
--
i
think,
we
both
cited
the
case
but
there
are
many
cases,
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
the
way
that
this
raised
is
an
objection
at
the
time
of
the
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
i
think
that
mr.
woody
has
stated
it
correctly,
as
i
understand,
while
we
have
number
of
cases.
there
has
been
some
divergence
of
opinion
but
there
are
a
number
of
cases
and
the
most
recent
ones
and
i
think
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
now
follow
that
rule
that
you
cannot
go
behind
the
search
warrant.
it
further
answered
your
question.
it's
my
understanding
that
when
a
search
warrant
is
issued
by
a
magistrate
--
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
i'd
--
i
preface
my
remarks
that
i
would
probably
draw
a
number
of
questions
on
this,
your
honor.
and
one
of
the
things
i
would
like
to
say
is
this,
that
when
a
magistrate
issues
a
search
warrant,
it's
my
understanding
that
he
is
actually
making
a
judicial
determination
at
that
time.
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
these
--
the
magistrate,
many
times,
i
think
it's
common
knowledge
that
they
know
the
officers
who
applied
for
these
search
warrants.
i
think
its
everyday
commonsense
to
say
if
i
were
a
magistrate
and
a
man
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
search
warrant,
an
officer,
some
officers
are
more
believable
than
others,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
magistrate
has
the
right
when
the
affidavit
is
brought
to
him
to
ask
additional
questions
and
make
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
--
there
would
be
sufficient
probable
cause
in
addition
to
what
is
stated
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
but
to
--
to
be
completely
candid
with
--
with,
your
honor,
mr.
woody,
i
believe
in
--
in
the
trial
court,
brought
out
the
fact
that
there
had
been
some
time
laps
from
the
time
that
they
received
part
of
the
information.
the
officer
said
the
first
information
that
we
received
is
on
the
1st
of
january.
he
had
then,
of
course,
asked
him
why
they
did
not
obtain
search
warrant
immediately
and
he
said
that
they
wanted
time
to
set
up
a
surveillance
and
they
did
not
obtain
the
search
warrant
until
the
8th
of
january,
one
week
later.
in
my
brief,
i
--
i
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
whatever
that
would
be
and
honestly,
i
think
that
there
is
no
more
than
what
is
stated
there
in
the
reference
in
the
--
in
the
record
where
you
were
reading
when
mr.
woody
was
making
his
argument,
i
think
it's
the
only
place
that
that
appears.
unfortunately,
it's
not
in
the
record
if
there
was
any
surveillance
and
if
there
were
any
other
facts
that
might
help
with
this
problem
but
they
are
not
there.
and
to
be
perfectly
fair,
i
don't
--
the
trial
court
did
follow
the
state
law
while
in
that
regard.
just
before
closing,
i
do
want
to
correct
one
impression
that
may
have
been
made.
the
trial
court
did
not
arbitrarily.
he
said
that
he
hadn't
read
the
case
of
mapp
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried.
but
i
believe
on
page
22,
it
indicates
there
that
counsel
did
give
him
the
case
and
they
did
read
it
and
did
consider
it
before
making
his
ruling.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
before
leaving
and
concluding
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
state
of
texas
relies
upon
the
affidavit
opinion
sale
for
stating
probable
cause
in
this
case.
we
stated
in
our
brief
and
we
still
would
contend
that
actually
the
affidavit
would
be
sufficient
even
under
the
federal
standards.
and
in
support
of
that
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
eisner
versus
united
states
found
in
297
federal
reporter.
in
that
case
a
federal
court
has
upheld
an
affidavit
which
read
as
follows."
information
has
been
obtained
by
sa
clifford
anderson,
fbi,
cincinnati,
ohio
which
he
believes
to
be
reliable
to
the
effect
that
sam
eisner
received
first
which
were
a
part
of
the
loot
from
the
davidson
indiana
fur
company
in
kentucky
after
they
have
been
transported
from
indianapolis
and
had
knowledge
that
they
have
been
stolen."
this
particular
affidavit
certainly
is
no
stronger
than
the
one
that
we
have
in
the
present
case.
certiorari
was
denied
in
this
case
and
we
would
offer
that
in
support
of
the
fact
that
the
affidavit
found
in
the
present
case
may
even
be
of
such
standard
that
it
would
meet
the
federal
requirement.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
that
was
the
case
of
eisner
versus
united
states,
your
honor
and
its
297,
federal
reporter
2d,
page
595
and
i
believe
decided
--
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
it's
cited
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
e.
f.
dally
we
would
also
say
that
the
--
that
this
honorable
court
in
their
opinion
of
ker
versus
california,
as
used
much
of
the
language
that
would
be
applicable
in
this
present
case
and
that
is
that
federally
that
the
mapp
decision
did
not
ring
the
bell
for
federalism
that
the
states
and
the
united
states
would
still
operate
side
by
side,
that
the
same
standards
would
not
be
applied.
we
would
say
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas
in
approving
this
affidavit
applied
the
fundamental
criteria
from
the
fourth,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
respectfully
submit
that
the
case
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
