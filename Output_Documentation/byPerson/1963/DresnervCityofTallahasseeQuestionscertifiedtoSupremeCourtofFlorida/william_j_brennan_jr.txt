justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
dixon,
perhaps,
i
--
i
must
say
you're
a
part
of
practice,
it
just
completely
be
funny
you
made
in
the
last
couple
of
years
in
many
cases
that
have
come
from
your
state.
and
i
--
do
i
read
your
law
correctly
as
providing
nearly
two
certiorari
forms,
a
certiorari
to
your
supreme
court.
isn't
there
some
form
called
certiorari
which
is
a
discretionary
review
in
the
supreme
court
provided
for
by
your
constitution
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
only
form
of
certiorari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
some
certiorari
in
--
in
the
couple
of
our
own
which
is
appellate
in
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
speaking
only
of
how
you
get
to
your
supreme
court
from
your
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
your
intermediate
courts
of
appeals
have
only
been
existing
a
few
years,
have
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
maybe
you
can
tell
me,
is
there
one
or
more
forms
of
certiorari
review
in
your
supreme
court,
common
law
form
and
an
appellate
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
one
common
law
form.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
an
original
writ
or
is
that
a
--
a
step
in
the
--
in
the
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
is
a
way
of
getting
to
your
supreme
court
by
appeal,
is
this
some
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
so
sure
you
wouldn't
if
--
you
may
get
a
review
on
your
federal
questions
on
a
discretionary
writ
in
your
supreme
court,
why
would
you
have
to
pursue
that
before
coming
here
to
us?
at
least
exhaust
that
advocate.
why
would
you
have
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it
doesn't
give
--
you
couldn't
get
your
federal
questions
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
get
reviewed
what?
only
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
persons
and
subjects
matter,
is
that
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
it
can't
be
such
as
mr.
justice
black
just
suggested
to
the
alabama
files,
where
you
can
get
a
review
whether
the
decision
below
is
contrary
to
state
law
has
state
as
the
supreme
court
has
announced
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
told
as
you
went
to
the
state
court
and
they
said
what
you
had
involved
here,
this
tallahassee
ordinance,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
not
a
state
statute
for
the
purposes
of
that
basis
of
review
in
the
supreme
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
did
you
go
--
didn't
you,
at
one
stage,
you
--
these
proceedings
go
into
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
certiorari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
had
--
and
you
were
there
--
do
you
--
you
lost
your
appeal
there,
didn't
you?
no,
sir,
we
lost
our
appeal
in
the
circuit
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
did
you
think
you
had
to
go
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
certiorari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
because
you
were
a
day
late
there,
your
application
was
not
entertained
and
then
you
came
directly
to
us
in
the
circuit
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
you
never
did
try
to
go
to
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
dixon,
if
--
are
you
familiar
with,
should
that's
give
it
i'm
sure,
robinson
versus
state,
decision
i
forgot
and
i
think
of
your
supreme
court
132
so.2d
3.
and
if
you
are,
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
language
means
that
on
common
law
of
certiorari,
that
court
can
consider
jurisdictional
questions
and
deviations
from
"the
essential
requirements
of
law",
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
were
the
issues
you
wanted
to
raise
on
your
application
for
certiorari
to
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unconstitutional
under
florida
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
prevailed
on
that
ground,
then
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
for
anybody
to
consider
the
federal
constitutional
claims,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
didn't
get
a
hearing
on
that
state
ground
contention
because
you
filed
a
day
late?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
under
ordinary
rules
that's
--
that
far
you
can
come
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
there
any
more
essential
requirements
of
law
than
federal
constitutional
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
mean
offhanded.
just
seems
to
me
you
could've
had
the
--
had
you
been
timely
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
as
i
read
that
robinson
case,
you
could
have
had
a
review
of
these
federal
questions
at
least
there
whether
or
not
you
could've
gather
review
on
the
supreme
court.
that's
--
i'm
just
saying
offhand,
that's
the
way
robinson
seems
to
me
to
read.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
only
goes
--
that
only
means
that
we
and
the
board
had
always
speak
the
same
language,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
appeals
of
right
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
from
the
district
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it?
are
there
some
appeals
of
rights
from
the
court's
first
instance
to
the
supreme
court
bypassing
the
court
of
--
intermediate
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
--
bypass
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
those
instances
where
you
can't
bypass
the
district
court,
you
get
there
by
right
or
is
it
on
writ
of
certiorari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
your
--
your
point
is
that
he,
might
on
writ
of
certiorari,
had
gotten
the
district
court
of
appeal
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
a
decision
adverse
to
him
there,
he
could
have
again
gone
at
the
supreme
court
again
on
discretionary
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
certainly
you've
introduce
(inaudible)
certification
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
this
from
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
something
different
from
certiorari?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
before
decisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
a
certification
by
the
district
court
of
appeal
which
does
not
require
any
application
and
--
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
might
suggest
that
in
my
(inaudible)
there
has
some
good
reason
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
all
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
domestic
tranquility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
these
ministers
and
rabbis,
in
others
words,
were
they
acting
in
a
way
that
appeared
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
really
the
crux
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
that
i
thought
fay
and
noia
tried
carefully
to
draw
the
line
between
jurisdiction
on
direct
review
and
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
habeas
corpus
put
on
--
on
collateral.
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
i
--
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case
at
all
on
direct
review
of
the
florida
courts
when
the
avenues
of
appeal
and
suggestion
is
at
least
these
had
not
been
exhausted
that
they
should
have
been
in
the
florida
court.
