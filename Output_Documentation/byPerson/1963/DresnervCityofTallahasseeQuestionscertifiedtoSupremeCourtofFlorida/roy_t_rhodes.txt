mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen.
if
i
might
address
myself
an
issue
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
black,
dealing
with
the
edward
decision
from
carolina
in
distinguish,
if
i
may,
the
application
of
the
theory
expressed
by
justice
clark,
not
denied
by
the
majority
of
this
court
in
the
different
set
of
factual
situation
that
we
have
in
this
instance.
in
the
edward
decision,
you
say
that
under
the
circumstances
that
this
group
of
demonstrator
were
arrested
that
they
were
denied
the
exercise
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
now,
those
demonstrators
had
arrived
at
a
place
before
the
building
the
house
of
legislation
of
that
state
and
it
had
been
there
from
all
late
that
morning
for
a
period
of
maybe
an
hour,
the
best
i
could
determine
from
the
record.
during
that
period
of
time,
the
temperature
within
which
they
found
themselves
had
changed
to
some
degree.
but
nonetheless,
they
had
continued
to
exercise
what
you
recognize
is
their
right
of
free
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly.
then,
the
officer
in
charge
or
the
responsible
person
charge
with
the
preservation
of
peace
to
that
community
determined
that
they
continue
exercise
of
that
right
that
you
recognized
constituted
a
breach
of
the
peace,
the
majority
of
this
court
said
no.
that
--
that
did
not
constitute
a
breach
of
the
peace
that
it
constituted
the
continued
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
which
you
recognized
and
therefore,
reversed
the
decisions.
our
position
is
that
in
the
language
expressed
by
justice
clark
in
the
dissent
in
that
case
that
he
recognized
something
that
this
court
has
not
declined
to
recognize,
that
is
a
corresponding
responsibility
and
a
corresponding
constitutional
duty
on
the
part
of
those
charged
with
the
preservation
of
peace
and
tranquility
within
a
community
irrespective
of
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
of
an
individual.
under
the
ordinance
in
question
in
the
city
of
tallahassee,
the
ordinance
provided
that
within
the
opinion
of
those
charged
under
the
ordinance
with
carrying
in
to
force
in
effect,
they
work
of
the
opinion
and
concerned
with
the
breach
of
the
peace
that
is
the
assembly
of
the
such
person
would
tend
to
create
a
disturbance.
that
mean
the
language
of
the
statute.
that's
not
fraud,
nebulous
language
but
rather
specific
language
that
somebody
under
the
terms
of
the
ordinance
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
carrying
out.
now,
when,
under
those
circumstances,
that
law
enforcement
officer
determines
that
the
continued
assemblage
of
persons
would
tend
to
create
a
disturbance
or
to
incite
a
riot
or
other
disorderly
conduct
and
so
forth,
that
it
becomes
an
unlawful
assembly.
that's
a
very
specific
charge.
and
factually
in
the
instance
before
the
court,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
petitions
exercised
this
right,
not
for
a
matter
of
an
hour
or
hour
and
a
half
or
half
a
day
but
from
about
the
middle
of
day
on
thursday
when
they
got
to
tallahassee
until
the
back
in
the
middle
of
the
following
day
when
they
were
ultimately
arrested.
you
have
a
record
which
reflects
the
change
during
that
period
of
time
of
some
24
hours
of
the
temperature
and
atmosphere
within
which
they
had,
24-hour
period,
been
exercising
that
right.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
are
the
continued
pursuit
of
what
is
initially
a
lawful
pursuit
can
become
an
unlawful
pursuit
or
can
become
the
abuse
of
a
constitutional
right
in
light
of
a
specific
ordinance
or
a
corresponding
constitutional
duty
placed
upon
those
charges
of
responsibility
of
preserving
the
peace
and
tranquility
within
the
community.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
sir?
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
why
was
it
disturbing
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
well,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
as
to
why
it
was
disturbing
the
community.
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
this
was
an
unusual
course
of
conduct
and
actions
to
be
carried
on
within
tallahassee,
florida
for
a
period
of
24
hours.
now,
that's
just
the
factual
truth
in
the
circumstances.
and
if
that
be
so,
then
the
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
sir?
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
was
it
tending
to
do
that,
sir?
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
that
was
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
officers
that
made
the
arrest,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
no,
sir,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
sir.
in
that
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
--
situation
--
in
that
situation,
you
had
people
that
were
present
there
for
a
period
of
--
of
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
in
our
situation,
you
have
an
hour
(voice
overlap)
present
for
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
--
24
hours
and
i
think
there's
a
substantial
difference.
i
think
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
or
a
lawful
right
can
become
unlawful
with
its
continued
exercise
in
circumstances
that
are
changing
from
the
inception
of
the
exercise
of
that
right.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
no,
sir.
i'm
attempting
to
differentiate
factually
with
the
situation
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court
in
the
edwards
case.
in
that
case,
the
facts
involved
are
short
span
of
time
and
the
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
it
foreseeably
could,
your
honor,
yes.
saying
--
saying
things
at
the
beginning
of
a
--
of
a
sermon,
for
instance
a
four-hour
sermon
in
a
situation
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
--
in
a
situation
in
which
we'll
say
nine
people
were
present
and
saying
things
four
hours
later
when
500
people
maybe
present
and
there
maybe
all
other
kinds
of
activity
going
on
could
constitute
the
unlawful
exercise
of
that
which
we
lawfully
(inaudible)
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
t.
rhodes
yes,
sir.
and
accordingly,
we
feel
that
for
the
preservation
of
peace
in
any
community
that
it's
necessary
that
this
court
recognize
the
corresponding
responsibility
in
those
that
are
charged
with
the
preservation
of
peace
in
the
community
to
recognize
the
rights
of
individuals
within
that
community.
but
in
so
doing
to
recognize
those
individual
rights
in
such
manner
that
the
rights
of
the
other
members
constituted
in
that
community
are
likewise
recognized
so
that
violence
is
not
performed
to
the
rights
of
either,
the
court
of
appeal
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
