mr.
howard
dixon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
1961
had
begun
a
new
phase
in
the
struggle
to
obtain
integration
in
the
south
and
to
arrive
at
a
new
level
of
dignity
of
mankind
as
we
would
further
have
it
under
our
democracy.
on
june
15th,
1961,
the
petitioners'
news
case
as
part
of
a
"freedom
ride"
arrived
in
the
respondent
city,
the
city
of
tallahassee
as
part
of
a
test.
they
testified
that
they
wanted
to
bear
witnesses
as
--
as
ministers,
rabbis
and
clergymen
to
the
struggle
to
obtain
those
rights
guaranteed
them
by
the
constitution.
but
first,
in
order
to
bear
witness,
they
wanted
to
test
transportation
facilities
to
determine
if
there
were
facilities
available
on
an
integrated
basis.
what
is
a
test?
legally,
a
test
to
this
kind
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
what
we
mean
by
a
legal
test.
we
would
define
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
as
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
availability
of
one's
constitutional
rights
and
to
do
so
peaceably
until
that
right
is
made
available.
their
first
test
in
tallahassee
came
when
they
arrived
in
a
clearway
to
a
bus
terminal.
they
were
met
by
some
citizens
who
obviously
hostile
and
menacing
to
a
certain
degree.
they
were
also
met
by
what
the
police
department
and
into
the
police
termed
"adequate
police
protection".
some
of
them
tested
the
facilities
of
the
bus
terminal
by
eating
in
the
coffee
shop,
testing
the
restroom
and
the
waiting
room.
mr.
howard
dixon
these
petitioners
are
clergymen
of
the
white
and
negro
race,
ministers
and
rabbis.
mr.
howard
dixon
and
--
they
could
test
that
because
the
south
literally
objects
to
the
mixture
of
the
races
in
any
social
situations
as
well
as
to
the
injection
of
any
negroes
into
a
social
situation
or
into
a
situation
that
legally
--
that
we
--
we
legally
we
maintain
is
their
--
by
rights
under
the
constitution.
in
short,
by
the
--
in
--
by
their
mixing,
it
is
a
violation
with
the
morals
and
customs
of
the
south.
mr.
howard
dixon
the
bus
terminal
at
this
time.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
but
however,
the
citizens
of
tallahassee,
if
i
may
describe
tallahassee,
it's
a
city
shorts
--
short
distance
from
the
alabama
border
and
its
settlements
are
more
of
those
of
montgomery,
alabama
than
say,
miami.
it
is
the
city
that
is
475
miles
distance
from
the
most
metropolitan
area
and
retains
the
flavor
and
color
of
the
old
competitor.
in
the
process
of
testing,
they
--
they
had
arrived
at
the
terminal's
point,
the
city
of
tallahassee
and
they
proceeded
to
go
to
the
tallahassee
terminal
to
take
air
transportation
back
to
their
homes
in
the
north.
some
of
the
passengers,
when
arriving,
confirmed
their
reservations
and
proceeded
to
take
the
plane
out
that
was
due
at
the
airport
at
about
3:25
on
june
the
15th,
1961.
mr.
howard
dixon
another
thing
your
honor,
they
have
been
allowed
to
test
and
they
--
mr.
howard
dixon
allowed
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
to
test
the
facilities
and
they
have
now
moved
on
to
the
airport.
they
had
no
--
there's
no
--
as
we've
just
said,
that
was
the
purpose
of
coming
to
tallahassee.
they
now
have
moved
on
to
the
airport
to
return
to
their
homes
in
new
york
and
washington
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes
--
no,
sir,
the
same
day.
mr.
howard
dixon
within
an
hour.
they
arrived
at
the
airport
terminal
about
1:30
p.m.
they
were
there
at
the
bus
terminal
about
12:30.
mr.
howard
dixon
they
were
served
at
the
bus
terminal.
however,
went
--
when
they
--
they
were
eight
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
at
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
two
point
they
got
to
the
airport.
the
petitioners
decided
that
as
they
had
been
adequately
served
so
they
went
to
the
airport
terminal
restaurant.
and
the
airport
terminal
restaurant
is
an
integral
part
of
the
terminal.
in
that,
there
was
only
a
glass
wall
separating
it
from
the
waiting
room
itself.
as
they
approached
the
door
to
the
restaurant,
they
saw
on
the
door
an
informally
lettered
sign
reading
"close".
upon
being
--
inquiries
being
made
by
the
spokesman,
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
advised
them
that
they
were
closed
for
mapping
up
and
they
would
reopen
at
4:30.
at
that
point,
they
determined
by
a
vote
among
themselves
that
they
would
cancel
their
reservation
to
enjoy
a
cup
of
coffee
when
the
restaurant
reopened
at
4:30.
mr.
howard
dixon
ten
petitioners.
mr.
howard
dixon
they
found
in
this
terminal
restaurant
that
there
were
segregated
facilities,
that
is
to
say
there
was
a
room
for
the
negroes
and
negro
--
room
for
the
whites
and
separate
restrooms
facilities
and
a
separate
eating
facilities
for
negroes
as
opposed
to
whites.
however,
the
place
in
which
they
wished
to
eat
was
obviously
the
white
restaurant
because
as
they
looked
into
the
glass
wall
with
the
sign
reading
"close"
on
the
door,
they
saw
white
people
eating
inside
the
restaurant.
and
in
--
later
in
the
testimony,
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
testified
that
the
restaurant
was
usually
open
from
6
a.m.
until
11:45
in
the
evening.
so
they
waited
until
4:30
and
when
the
restaurant
did
not
open,
they
sat
in
the
waiting
room
until
the
terminal
close
that
evening,
until
11:45
p.m.
now,
during
that
time,
they
were
adequately
guarded
by
the
police,
the
city
testified
to
that
effect.
they
were
a
number
of
people
outside
or
perhaps
were
just
curious
to
see
them
and
some
of
them
who
were
hostile
to
the
point
of
violence.
the
city
manager
of
tallahassee
testified
that
there
were
never
anymore
to
three
or
four
cars
or
perhaps
four
or
five
people
in
each
of
the
cars
outside
of
the
terminal.
they
--
at
the
end
of
the
close
of
the
day
when
the
terminal
restaurant
close
down,
they
obtained
transportation
back
to
the
city
of
tallahassee
and
lodging
and
in
--
of
course,
in
the
meantime,
they
had
made
reservations
on
the
plane
to
leave
the
following
morning
at
8:30
a.m.
and
the
next
morning,
they
were
back
there
at
8
a.m.
and
again
they
approached
the
restaurant
and
again
the
sign
"close"
was
on
the
door.
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir.
they
spent
the
night
at
sympathizers
and
negroes
of
the
community
who
were
supporting
core
and
these
activities.
so
when
they
were
back
the
night
--
the
following
morning,
they
saw
the
restaurant
signs
still
there.
they
cancelled
their
reservations
and
made
tentative
reservations
for
1:30
or
1:45
that
afternoon.
they,
again,
sat
in
the
restaurant
and
again,
they
had
adequate
police
protection,
and
again
there
were
some
people
who
were
outside
who
were
hostile
to
them
and
do
exhibit
some
feelings
of
violence.
along
towards
noon,
they
saw
that
again,
the
sign
was
not
going
to
come
down.
the
walls
of
jericho
were
not
going
to
fall.
they
cancelled
their
third
reservation.
now,
the
city
makes
a
great
deal
to
do
about
the
cancellation
of
these
reservations
but
we
maintain
that
it's
between
a
private
corporation
in
the
airlines
and
these
individuals
and
there's
no
concern
of
the
city
how
many
cancellations
of
reservations
they
had
made.
and
upon
that
happening
in
--
within
half
an
hour,
they
were
approached
by
the
city
attorney
for
the
city
of
tallahassee
who
identified
himself
as
the
special
police
officer
of
the
city
and
said,
"i
am
advised
that
your
assembly
here
was
tend
to
create
a
disturbance
or
incite
a
riot
or
disorderly
conduct
within
the
city
of
tallahassee.
and
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
florida
and
the
city
of
tallahassee,
i
command
all
of
you
who
are
here,
assemble
immediately
and
peaceably
to
disperse.
if
you
do
not
immediately
and
peaceably
disperse,
i
shall
arrest
you
or
charge
to
be
arrested
for
unlawful
assembly."
reverend
collier,
the
spokesman
for
the
group
stated
simply
that
"it's
lawfully
we're
here
under
the
protection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act"
and
he
sat
down.
the
city
attorney
messer
immediately
ordered
the
officers
to
arrest
the
10
petitioners
and
they
were
taken
to
the
jail
and
booked.
the
following
morning,
several
of
the
petitioners
out
on
bond
and
in
haste
to
return
to
the
various
portions,
they
did
it
because
it
was
saturday
and
they
had
to
get
back
to
preach,
went
by
the
terminal
restaurant
and
again,
the
sign
was
close
but
again,
there
were
white
people
inside
the
restaurant.
but
again,
in
--
with
regard
to
this
restaurant,
it
had
opened
up
saturday
morning
and
was
only
closed
apparently
when
the
petitioners
came
by
to
board
their
plane
after
they
were
released
from
jail.
the
trial
proceeded
on
the
following
week
on
june
22nd
and
petitioners'
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
quash
which
raised
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
first
amendment
rights
to
equal
protection
of
laws
and
the
protection
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
the
trial,
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
--
as
to
any
unlawful
rioters
or
to
move
to
its
conduct.
however
--
and
in
addition
thereto,
the
testimony
adequately
discloses
that
there
was
complete
police
protection
provided
for
the
petitioners
at
all
times.
now,
the
florida
statute
provided
that
in
order
for
that
to
be
unlawful
assembly,
there
had
to
be
of
any
persons
or
persons
whether
armed
or
not
unlawfully,
riotously
or
tumultuously
assembled
within
the
city
of
tallahassee.
the
mayor
or
any
officer
specified
in
the
statute
within
the
opinion
of
the
said
mayor
or
any
officers,
there
is
--
the
assembly
of
such
persons
shall
tend
to
create
a
disturbance
or
incite
a
riot
or
disorderly
conduct.
the
mayor
may
go
among
the
persons
or
the
duly
delegated
officer
and
advised
them
to
disperse
and
if
they
failed
to
do
so,
they
will
be
considered
guilty
of
the
crime
--
charge
of
the
crime.
the
evidence
failed
to
disclose
that
these
facilities
were
not
integrated,
that
is
to
say,
every
--
every
witness
who
has
something
to
do
with
the
facility
testified
that
these
were
a
segregated
facilities
from
the
--
actually,
the
white
waiting
room
and
separate
negro
waiting
room
to
the
restroom
and
into
the
restaurant
themselves.
mr.
howard
dixon
never
opened
during
the
period
these
people
were
there.
there
were
people
eating
in
the
restaurant
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
and
one
of
the
petitioners,
i
presumed
they
got
hungry
at
sometime
of
the
day,
went
around
to
the
kitchen
and
found
that
they
were
preparing
meals
for
the
airplanes
and
that
the
chief
of
the
detectives
was
eating
in
the
kitchen
but
i
don't
think
my
petitioner
felt
that
he
could
necessary
do
the
same
thing.
the
record
is
bearing
that
the
--
that
the
petitioners
had
any
notice
that
the
restaurant
was
closed
was
a
reason
given
by
the
restaurant
manager
in
his
testimony.
he
testified
that
they
closed
the
restaurant
because
they
were
under
repair.
upon
close
requesting
he
admitted
they
had
two
reasons,
the
one
thing
that
they
want
that
heard
about
this
"freedom
ride"
in
alabama
and
other
states
and
that
they
wanted
to
avoid
violence
so
they
took
this
opportunity
to
close
to
make
the
repair.
but
there
is
a
(inaudible)
testimony
to
the
effect
that
before
and
after
the
restaurant
was
open
and
providing
service
for
white
customers.
the
--
at
the
close
of
our
case,
we
also
introduced
--
reintroduce
some
motion
to
quash
on
the
same
constitutional
grounds.but
petitioners
were
found
guilty
and
fined
$500
each
or
in
default
thereof
they
were
given
a
60-day
sentence.
an
appeal
was
taken
directions
to
the
florida
supreme
court
on
the
basis
that
the
tallahassee
statute
was
taken
directly
from
the
state
statutes
and
was
--
was
adopted
in
direct
reference
thereto
but
the
florida
supreme
court
under
its
jurisdiction,
which
allowed
them
to
construe
a
state
statute,
said
this
was
not
a
state
statute
and
claimed
that
we
had
improvidently
lodged
our
appeal
in
that
court
and
referred
it
back
to
the
circuit
court
of
leon
county.
the
circuit
court
of
leon
county,
we
pursued
our
appeal
and
the
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
under
the
state
constitution,
article
5
section
6
paragraph
3,
the
state
court
is
the
highest
appellate
court
from
cases
arising
in
the
municipal
court.
we
therefore
have
brought
these
petitioners
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
common
--
mr.
howard
dixon
your
honor,
we
find
that
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
is
discretionary
and
is
the
old
common
law
form
that
is
to
say
is
very
limited
and
restricted
in
a
scope.
it's
limited
to
the
jurisdiction
and
to
determining
what
are
the
essential
requirements
of
law.
certainly,
in
--
this
court
has
considered
the
cases
arising
from
texas
in
largent
versus
texas
and
tucker
versus
texas
where
it
was
a
question
of
jehovah's
witnesses
and
so
forth
where
there
was
a
highest
court,
appellate
court
that
the
petitioner
could
go.
and
so,
from
the
county
court
in
texas,
they
went
directly
to
the
supreme
court
on
an
appeal.
well,
of
course,
perhaps,
you
could
consider
our
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
ground
--
actual
basis
as
being
an
appeal
but
we
feel
that
we
could
not
get
a
full
review
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
therefore,
we
could
come
here
because
it
would
present
to
the
federal
questions
which
under
magnum
--
(inaudible)
you
--
you
--
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
you're
mostly
concerned
with
important
questions
of
public
interest
which
we
think
is
this.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
case
in
--
in
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
states
versus
katz.
mr.
howard
dixon
state
versus
katz.
mr.
howard
dixon
k-a-t-z
and
state
versus
smith.
mr.
howard
dixon
that's
108
so.2d
60
which
outlines
completely
the
--
the
limited
scope
of
calling
all
writ
of
certiorari
in
court.
mr.
howard
dixon
oh,
i'm
sorry,
sir.
state
versus
smith
is
118
so.2d
792.
mr.
howard
dixon
something
like
that,
your
honor,
i'm
not
--
mr.
howard
dixon
well
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
we
are
not
allowed
a
--
a
right
of
review
as
a
matter
of
right
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
to
a
supreme
court.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
but
it
will
not
present
the
federal
questions.it
will
not
present
a
full
review.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
i
think
it
said
that
under
the
statute
that
is
the
common
law
of
writ
of
certiorari
but
as
far
as
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
that's
the
only
--
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
we
have
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
is
granted
in
--
from
administrative
decisions
to
higher
courts.
but
that
--
that
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
(voice
overlap)
few
years.
mr.
howard
dixon
just
the
one
common
law
form.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
it's
--
it's
an
original
writ
because
if
you
take
in
--
if
you
can
take
a
writ
of
certiorari
say
from
my
circuit
court
to
a
circuit
district
court
of
appeals,
then
from
that
decision,
if
you
want
appeal
for
district
court
of
appeals,
you
must
take
an
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
after
you
--
after
you
got
into
the
district
court
which,
of
course,
is
discretionary,
that
would
seem
to
me
that
you
could
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
yes,
sir.
but
you're
getting
there
will
be
discretionary
under
the
common
law
writ.
in
other
words,
we
would
not
have
to
follow
that
in
order
to
apply
here
for
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
because
it
doesn't
give
a
full
review
and
in
addition,
we
--
we
would
feel
--
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir,
we
do
not
plead
and
we
get
our
federal
question
reviewed.
mr.
howard
dixon
jurisdiction
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir,
an
essential
requirement.
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
could
be
that.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir,
that
is
passing
directly
from
the
--
construing
a
--
controlling
position
of
the
florida
or
federal
constitution
if
it
was
involved
in
--
in
any
state
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
the
validity
of
the
state
statute
or
federal
statute
or
treaty
or
construing
or
controlling
provision
of
the
florida
federal
constitution.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
and
they
send
us
back
to
the
circuit
court
because
they
said
this
is
where
our
appeal
lies.
and
of
course,
according
to
the
constitution,
it
says
that
the
circuit
court
is
the
highest
appellate
court
for
cases
arising
from
the
municipal
court.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
when
--
not
in
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case,
it's
in
the
statute,
it's
article
5.
it
will
be
in
article
5
section
6
paragraph
3,
it
will
be
in
the
appendix
--
well,
well,
(inaudible)
at
the
moment,
your
honor,
but
i'm
sure
it's
in
here
several
times.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
that
was
after
we
had
taken
our
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
leon
county.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes.
but
when
we
took
our
petitioner
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
we
were
a
day
late
in
filing.
now,
a
--
mr.
howard
dixon
we
thought
that
--
we
didn't
have
to
go
there.
we
thought
that
it
was
discretionary
if
we
have
filed
within
the
period
of
time
and
still
would've
been
a
manner
for
--
by
discretion,
whether
we
went
there
or
we
applied
here.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir,
not
again.
we
went
there
once
and
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
(inaudible).
mr.
howard
dixon
not
a
full
review.
it
couldn't
have
given
us
a
full
review.
i
--
and
i
don't
think
that
they
would
have
passed
on
the
federal
questions
which
we
think
are
prime
importance
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
it
would
be
one
determining
possibly
the
application
of
the
statute
under
the
florida
constitution,
which
we
do
not
feel
that
if
they
--
after
it
was
applied,
would
not
bring
into
scope.
the
federal
questions
involved,
mainly,
a
right
to
be
in
speech
assembly
and
so
forth.
mr.
howard
dixon
i
don't
think
i
can,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
the
court
would
like
the
supplemental
memorandum
brief
with
the
adjective
provided.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
the
essential
requirements
of
law
are
defined
in
one
case
and
here
as
due
process.
but
i
don't
think
they
mean
due
process
in
the
times
which
we
have
explored
in
this
case
that
is
to
say
on
thompson
versus
louisville.
i
think
it
means
more
than
procedural
due
process
whether
there's
a
louisville
counsel
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
howard
dixon
what
we
want
to
raise
basically
that
the
statutes
as
applied
was
unconstitutional
and,
of
course
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
because
we
feel
that
--
that
writ
was
merely
discretionary
and
--
and
we
--
as
that
day
we
could
have
filed
before
time
and
if
we
didn't
get
a
decision,
we
can
still
come
here
because
we
were
applying
under
the
federal
code
from
the
highest
appellate
court
in
our
state.
mr.
howard
dixon
oh,
it
seems
to
me
yes,
that
they
could.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
that
we
could
go
to
use
the
district
court
of
appeals
or
supreme
court
under
a
restrictive
right
of
review.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
under
an
opportunity
to
have
for
review,
the
--
the
common
law
writ
in
florida
does
not
provide
for
a
full
review
of
the
case
below.
and
under
the
circumstances,
it
will
be
the
same
as
if
in
largent
versus
texas,
we
had
filed
an
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
decision
and
ask
this
court
to
hear
our
appeal.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
i
think
that
we
will
--
we
are
gone
there
once.
we
would
probably
have
filed
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
we
tried
that
and
we
were
late.
mr.
howard
dixon
not
if
we
already
had
our
appeal
filed
in
the
district
court
and
after
they
accepted
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
could
have.
mr.
howard
dixon
well,
yes,
but
i
think
we
could
come
up
here
because
as
--
under
the
--
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
we've
maintained
that
they
could
not
have
reviewed
the
federal
questions
because
it
would
not
have
come
within
the
purview
of
the
jurisdictional
questions
or
the
essential
--
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
that
impression,
i
was
wrong.
i
would
correct
that.
they
would
not
--
either
the
district
or
the
state
supreme
court
been
able
to
give
you
full
review
on
the
federal
questions.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
i
don't
know
but
i
--
it
feels
that's
the
highest
appellate
court
we
have
insofar
as
the
full
review
is
concern.
mr.
howard
dixon
quite
possibly
--
mr.
howard
dixon
--
under
our
essential
requirement
of
law,
some
federal
questions
may
be
reviewed.
but
we
--
the
state
--
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
you're
right.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir.
the
petitioners
press
there
--
claims
under
the
motion
to
quash
under
the
grounds
of
the
thompson
versus
louisville
decision
which
stated
that
the
lack
of
evidence
or
the
lack
of
any
evidence
of
a
crime
being
committed
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
that
also
was
a
claim
that
we
pursued
in
this
court
together
with
the
question
concerning
the
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
which
even
assuming
argumendo
that
the
petitioners
were
found
guilty
of
violating
the
unlawful
assembly
law
of
city
of
tallahassee.
they
went
under
any
circumstances
under
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
assembly,
then
permitted
their
rights
to
assemble
because
the
conflict
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
first
amendment.
there
were
no
words
of
incitement
and
at
all
times,
the
petitioners
were
peacable
and
displayed
no
harshness
or
any
type
performed
to
misconduct
whatsoever.
this
line
of
cases,
of
course,
is
--
it's
been
highlighted
in
the
past
year
by
edwards
verus
south
carolina
and
garner
versus
louisiana
and
so
forth.
and
the
third
and
chief
ground
was
that
the
denial
of
the
facilities
on
--
at
the
terminal
that
is
the
restaurant
facility
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
under
the
boynton
verus
virginia
case.
and
as
such,
this
was
a
denial
to
them
of
rights
amended
under
the
constitution.
that
way
--
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir.
mr.
howard
dixon
yes,
sir,
clergymen
or
rabbis.
we
did
make
a
claim,
however,
on
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
as
you
may
recall
in
wright
versus
georgia,
this
court
said
that
when
the
police
officer
ordered
the
basketball
players
to
disperse,
they
said
that
their
order
was
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
is
the
importance
public
issue
of
this
particular
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
south
has
for
years
been
proving
for
legal
tools
in
which
to
maintain
the
status
quo
that
these
cases
of
such
importance
that
you
will
consider
the
petitioners'
petition.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
dixon
no,
sir,
i
think
that
was
on
--
we
should
have
one
but
hindsight
is
better
than
foresight
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
dixon
your
honor,
what
if
we
could
extend
that
to
one
--
10
days?
