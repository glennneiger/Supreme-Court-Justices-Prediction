the
validity
of
this
statutory
or
constitutional
interpretation
validity
question
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
the
--
could
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
considered
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
byron

white
and
you
--
and
you
would
have
taken
to
them
both
your
federal

both
your
florida

constitutional
question
if

writ
of
certiorari
to

and
you
were
a
day
late?
justice

and
that's
why
it
was
dismissed?

(inaudible)
as
soon
as
the
circuit
court

as
your
circuit
court
acts
on
an
appeal
from
a
municipal
court's
judgment
that
you

to
this
court
without
even
attempting
to
get
in
to
the
district
court
of
appeals

any
of
your
supreme

that's
what
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
told
me
how
those,
the
district
court
of
appeals
could
have
handled
both
federal
and
state
constitutional
questions
in
any
of
your
supreme
court
that
you
would
have
gotten
the
restrictive
review
of
this?

on
your

on
your
state
constitutional
question.
justice
byron

do
you
--
you
mean
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case
that
the
circuit
court
is
the
only
court
in
your
--
is
the
highest
court
in
your
state
in
which
you
may
have
a
review
of
your
federal
constitutional
question?
justice

well,
that's
what
i
--
justice
byron

white
--
that's
what
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you.
is
this
a
--
is
there
some
place
in
the
florida
appellate
court
system
that
a
litigant
can
have
a
--
have
a
circuit
court's
decision
on
his
federal
constitutional
question
reviewed?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
--
it's
your
position
that
there
is
a
higher
court
to
which
federal
constitutional
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
are
two,
even
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
if
the
--
even
if
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
acted
--
had
taken
its
case
and
had
rule
against
the
--
he
could
go
to
your
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
a
common
law
writ?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
--
do
you
have
any
instances
or
any
citations
where
the
supreme
court
or
any
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has,
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
district
court
and
--
your
intermediate
appellate
court
where
the
writ
of
certiorari,
it
had
dealt
with
a
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
usual
route
--
what
is
the
usual
route
for
an
intermediate
court
to
the
supreme
court?
only
certiorari
or
is
there
an
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
do
to
do
that?
