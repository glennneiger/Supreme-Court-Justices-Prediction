justice
hugo
l.
black
but
may
i
ask
you,
what
case
we
thought
that
we
can
look
to
see
that
the
review
is
such
a
limited
nature
that
doesn't
amount
to
--
in
a
review?
there
was
a
case
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state
versus
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
you
spell
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
other
one
beside
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
that
because,
alabama,
your
neighboring
state
has
a
system
of
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals
while
it
was
originally
thought,
as
i
recall
it.
if
there
--
that
went
in
to
review
the
supreme
court
held
differently,
instead,
held
that
they
had
a
common
law
right
a
rule
of
right
to
bring
a
full
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
court
would
therein
decide
whether
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
rarely
been
against
the
law
of
the
state
as
announced
by
the
supreme
court,
is
that
about
what's
done
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
wouldn't
--
that
has
turned
out
to
be
a
--
a
right
to
practice
a
plenary
review
in
the
court
of
--
supreme
court
of
alabama?
and
i
don't
know
just
--
what
your
state
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
get
there
by
a
discretionary
writ.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
said
in
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
one
thing
that
i
have
been
quite
(inaudible)
you
said
that
--
that's
--
after
you
were
tried,
you
thought
you
have
a
discretionary
right
either
to
go
to
court
of
appeals
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
which
supreme
court
of
florida
are
to
come
here.
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
we
had
a
discretion
to
do
that
or
you
could
come
on
(inaudible)
directly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
supposed
you
had
gone
exercised
what
you
think
was
your
discretion
to
go
into
the
court
of
appeals
of
florida
or
the
--
in
the
supreme
court
i
understood
you
to
say
you'll
have
a
right
of
appeal
directly,
do
you,
if
you
had
gone
there,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
and
--
and
suppose
you
had
not
been
late,
do
you
think
you
could
have
brought
it
on
up
here
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
they
acted
on
it.
suppose
they
had
acted,
decided
against
you,
could
you
have
come
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
is
--
were
those
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
i'm
sorry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
reported
or
now
reported?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
report
(voice

reporting
there?
we
didn't
say
what
the
ground
we
denied
them
or
did
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
same
cases?
is
that
the
same
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
other
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
356
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
wait
a
minute,
may
i
ask
you
if
there's
been
any
labor
decision,
and
that
is
the
state
versus
smith,
which
your
adversary
cited
to
us
in
which
i
now
have
before,
citing
out
what
kind
of
rights
can
be
taken
up
as
of
1960.
and
it
very
much
follows
the
rule
in
alabama
to
which
i
refer
in
which
it
says,
"and
we
resist
the
rule
wherein
they
have
--
they
can
bring
(inaudible)
with
the
issue
with
the
court's
discretion
to
correct
the
procedural
court
wherein
they
have
not
observed,"
as
justice
brennan
read,
"those
requirements
of
the
law
which
are
deem
to
be
essential
to
the
administration
of
justice."
then
he
says,
â€œfailure
to
observe
the
essential
requirements
of
the
law
means
failure
to
accord
due
process
of
law
within
the
contemplation
of
the
constitution
are
the
commission
of
--
and
error
so
fundamental
in
character
is
to
fatally
infect
the
judgment
and
render
it
void."
then
he
says,
"it
seems
to
be
the
southern
law
of
the
state
that
the
duty
of
a
court
to
apply,
to
admitted
facts
a
correct
principle
of
law,
correct
principle
of
law
is
such
a
fundamental
and
essential
element
of
the
judicial
process
that
a
litigant
cannot
be
said
to
have
the
remedy
and
by
due
process
of
law
guaranteed
by
section
4
of
the
declaration
of
rights."
and
the
--
the
alabama
ground
was
that
you
had
to
have
decisions
of
law
in
order
to
keep
the
law
uniform
throughout
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
the
federal
law
has
applied
in
a
given
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
seems
to
me
that
they
can
bring
it
up
--
bring
it
up
as
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
matter
of
discretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
--
is
that
pretty
fairly
expressed
the
rule
as
you
understand
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
give
us
any
later
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
hold
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
court
hold
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
reading
from
the
dissent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
appeal
your
argument
doesn't
amount
to
this.maybe
it's
good
because
of
the
difference
of
opinion
on
this
and
has
been
and
so
expressed
by
judges.
you
say
that
even
though
a
person
is
exercising
an
undoubted
constitutional
right,
if
the
police
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
exercise
of
that
undoubted
constitutional
right
may
obtain
people
who
disagree
with
disputes
and
so
that
it
might
make
them
wanted
to
hit
it
or
create
some
vows
that
men,
he
can
be
denied
the
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
can
be
convicted
for
exercising.
justice
hugo
l.
black
continue
to
exercise
of
undoubted
constitutional
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
somebody
who
is
uphold
to
his
views
might
want
to
create
disturbance,
in
other
words,
that
even
though
the
disturbance
has
brought
them
out
because
some
person
disagrees
with
another
fellow's
exercise
of
his
constitution
right,
then
he
can
be
convicted
for
exercising
its
constitutional
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
it?
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
thought
it
was,
it
is
--
many
spokesmen
for
that
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we've
had
it
in
connection
with
some
of
religious
activities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
do
anything
in
your
judgment
that
they
didn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did.
suppose
it's
a
constitutional
right
to
do
it
this
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
--
to
violate
a
law
but
did
you
have
any
law
against
their
being
there?
that's
in
special
term
that
fits
this
case.
did
you
have
any
law
that
says
that
people
should
not
gather,
which
applied
to
everybody
without
the
--
what
--
what
they
were
there
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
is
this
the
law
that
you
referred
to
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
one
that
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
pointed
out.
it
finally
get
down
to
the
point
that
the
only
trouble
that
was
because
would
be
by
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
under
that
(inaudible)
law
just
that
--
suppose
--
suppose
a
man
which
in
the
end,
he
belong
to
a
sect
and
the
others
didn't
like
it,
they
were
so
much
against
it
as
frequently
the
case
that
they
fight
about
it
if
somebody's
there
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
created
a
disturbance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what's
the
difference
in
that
case
and
this
one
then
if
these
people
had
a
constitutional
right
to
do
what
they
would
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
domestic
tranquility.
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
also
some
other
things
that
it
says
people
shall
have
the
right
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
of
--
do
you
have
any
law
--
do
you
have
any
law
that
specifically
and
pointedly
find
that
everybody
without
regards
to
race
or
color
tries
to
regulate
your
streets
or
tries
to
regulate
your
places
so
that
not
more
than
eight
people
should
be
gather
there
to
place
might
congest
to
--
for
some
purposes
of
that
kind
(inaudible)
special
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
that
says
you
must
(inaudible)
now,
that
doesn't
come
in
here
because
you
say
they
were
not
there.
what
you
say
is
that
they
come
under
the
brief
by
even
though
they
are
exercising
a
constitutional
right,
they
can
be
all
in
a
way
because
somebody
else
might
object
to
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
right
so
strongly
that
they
might
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
maybe
that
you
are
right
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
amounts
to
this.
that
amounts
to
this.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
and
it
seems
to
me
is
the
issue
you
have
to
meet.
that
if
an
exercise
of
a
plain
constitutional
right,
then
they
earn
people
who
have
their
feet
on
the
ground
as
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
afraid
that
somebody
else
in
the
community
will
so
hardly
disagree
with
them
that
they
may
get
into
fight
and
create
a
disturbance
that
then
the
officers
can
arrest
the
people
who
exercise
their
constitutional
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

constitution
says
something
about
the
right
of
peaceful
assembly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
if
the
assembly
itself
--
do
you
charge
here
that
the
assembly
itself
became
non-peaceable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
do
you
contend
that
there
was
any
attendant
in
the
world
on
the
part
of
the
assembly
itself
to
become
non-peaceable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
mill
around?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
against
--
do
you
have
any
specific
special
statute
aimed
at
people
milling
around
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
were
not
violating
any
law
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
law
against
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
it
--
maybe
that
you
should
pass
a
law
which
says,
i'm
not
sure,
that
people
should
not
cancel
their
reservations
but
you
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
if
officer
thinks
somebody
else
may
get
disturbed
by
it
and
might
get
belligerent
then
you
can
arrest
the
people
who
do
it.
is
that
it?
even
though
they're
exercising
their
constitutional
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
had
a
case
somewhat
like
that
in
connecticut
where
one
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
was
using
--
for
the
strong
language
against
the
religion
and
the
argument
was
that
people
with
that
faith
were
allowed
to
come
up
and
have
a
fight
with
them.
at
that
poll,
they
could
arrest
the
people
for
advocating
their
religion
and
the
(inaudible)
can
do
that
suddenly
on
the
broad
over
all
statute.
sometimes
it
--
it
might
be
wise
in
trying
to
curve
conduct,
try
to
curve
the
conduct
except
specifically
on
reasonable
grounds
rather
than
by
big
statutes.
it
might
be
more
effective.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
it
was
unlawful
before
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
--
is
it
your
idea
that
it
was
unlawful
before
the
policemen
ordered
them
to
disperse
or
after
which
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
it
disturbing
here
if
it
didn't
disturb
--
if
they
were

justice
hugo

why
was
it
disturbing
here
if
they
were
peaceable
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
afraid
to
disturb
people
to
anger
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
create
unrests
among
the
people,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
afraid
that
what
it
would
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
your
own
--
that
your
basis
for
your
statute
on
that
that
edwards
says
that
you
can't
do
that.
it
said,
if
south
carolina
had
made
a
defense,
they
made
a
conviction
of
them
that
that
peace
there
disturb
people
to
anger,
invited
public
dispute
have
brought
about
other
condition
of
unrest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
are
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
then
(voice

here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
two
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
pointed
out
that
the
statute
brought
the
name
that
preventing
congestion
of
the
streets.
it
was
a
name
that
saying
you
can't
do
certain
things
at
certain
time.
but
it
was
simply
has,
your
statute
seems
to
be,
appear
that
what
they
were
saying
whether
they
said
that
an
hour
or
two
days
would
disturb
people
to
anger,
create
disputes
and
make
them
mad
because
of
the
views
that
they
expressed.
you
say
if
it's
done
an
--
a
day,
it's
constitutional,
you
can
stop
it
but
if
it's
an
hour,
it
can't
be
stopped?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
man
preaches
four
hours
instead
of
an
hour,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
might
not
like
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
--
i
don't
want
you
to
get
misunderstand
what
i'm
saying
i
think
that
you
have
presented
the
issue
as
it
is
--
justice

--
but
--
with
reference
to
your
case.
