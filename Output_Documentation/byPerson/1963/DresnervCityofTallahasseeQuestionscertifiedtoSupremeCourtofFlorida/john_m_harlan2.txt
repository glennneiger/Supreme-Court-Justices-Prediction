justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
have
understood
there
was
alleged
state
ground
for
this
case
(inaudible)
writ
of
certiorari
(inaudible)
namely,
that
under
your
state
constitution,
state
procedure,
there
was
available
to
you
as
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
if
so,
you
just
make
it
--
make
that
application
and
therefore,
we
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
any
--
i
thought
they
were
responsible
to
exchange
back
and
forth
on
this
thing
before
the
advantage
of
writ,
then
i
find
no
argument
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
noticed
in
your
reply
brief
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
narrow
question
is
simply
this,
your
statements
in
(inaudible)
this
discretionary
review
in
this
type
of
situation
will
have
any
jurisdictional
questions
(inaudible)
if
that's
true,
then
what
you
say
the
court
was
correct.
you
don't
get
a
full
review.
on
the
other
hand,
i
understood
the
state
to
say
in
its
petition
in
its
(inaudible)
done
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
that
limited
review
of
the
phrase
jurisdiction
within
the
state
department
under
florida
law
jurisdiction
be
used
in
a
broad
sense
that
would've
permitted
you
to
test
the
federal
questions
under
these
discretionary
applications
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
that's
the
issue
that's
in
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
made
no
argument
(inaudible)
on
the
brief
based
on
the
possible
vagrancy
of
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
order
for
certiorari
says
specifically
that
the
part
with
our
requested
to
brief
the
jurisdictional
question
(inaudible)
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
circuit
court
in
the
state
of
florida
was
granted.
counsel
or
--
counsel
or
directly
to
brief
and
argue
the
petition
to
the
merit,
the
question
whether
the
judgment
was
supported
by
adequate
state
ground.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
that
mean?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
granting
everything
you
say
that
the
statute
is
so
vague
that
these
petitioners
correct
me
if
i
understood,
to
reasonably
understood
raising
a
kind
of
conduct
which
would
show
in
that
case.
