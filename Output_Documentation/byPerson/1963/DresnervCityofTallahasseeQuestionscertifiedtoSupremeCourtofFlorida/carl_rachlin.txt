mr.
carl
rachlin
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
honorable
court.
i
wish
to
thank
the
court
for
the
privilege
of
submitting
a
supplemental
memorandum.
as
a
non-member
of
the
florida
bar,
i
must
confess
to
the
difficulties
of
trying
to
understand
the
vagaries
of
the
florida
appellate
procedure
appeared
in
this
case
at
about
a
late
date
but
i
have
great
concern
for
the
petitioners
here
in
this
general
counsel
for
the
organization
which
sponsored
their
trip
where
there's
one
that
may
be
known
to
some
of
you
the
congress
of
racial
equality.
in
any
event,
i
would
like
to
suggest
one-forth
which
we
will
brief
in
this
--
in
this
memorandum
to
permit
me
to
draw
the
analogy
of
fay
against
noia.
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
with
this
court,
there
was
no
other
place
they
could
go.
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
was
timely
filed
in
that
limited
sense.
the
time
to
file
such
a
petition
had
already
expired
in
the
florida
court.
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
remedy
in
the
florida
court.
and
if
i
understand,
the
reasonable
inferences
of
fay
against
noia
and
i
say
--
suggest
you
expand
this
argument
perhaps
in
a
--
of
memorandum.despite
the
laps
of
some
20
years
in
that
case,
this
court
undertook
to
entertain
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
even
though
all
the
remedies
that
may
have
been
available
to
the
petitioner
in
fay
against
noia
had
not
been
exhausted
in
the
state
of
new
york.
but
as
i
suggest,
we
will
try
to
develop
this
argument
at
some
greater
length.
now,
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
your
honor,
i
recognize
there
is
that
distinction
and
this
is
something
we
will
have
to
attempt
to
persuade
you
in
this
memorandum,
not
we
are
going
to
have
--
we
would
in
10
days.
with
regard
to
the
few
comments
i
would
like
to
make
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
this
proceeding.
it
is
our
--
adopted
--
it
is
our
position
to
(inaudible)
if
it
should
have
been
read
at
all,
it's
read
to
the
wrong
people.
this
case
and
the
similar
ones
that
have
appeared
before
this
court,
and
once
that
i
have
tried
in
some
of
the
other
states
in
the
united
states,
always
seem
to
turn
on
a
kind
of
blackmail
theory
of
law.
if
i
don't
like
what
you
have
to
say,
i
get
up
a
crowd,
i
make
noise
and
then
i'm
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
or
as
in
the
case
here
for
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
so
called
riot
act.
this
--
we
--
we
suggest
that
this
approach
is
really
part
of
the
discriminatory
segregation
attitude
of
the
community.
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
refer
this
court
to
--
to
page
18
of
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
court
because
while
the
comments
are
entirely
irrelevant
to
a
legal
proceeding,
they
illustrate
perfectly
the
state
of
mind
that
was
gathering
together
against
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
and
i
read
from
the
top
of
the
page,
part
of
this
brief
is
written
on
august
28th,
1963.
as
one
of
the
riders
was
reading
the
morning
papers
under
a
byline
of
a
national
news
syndicate,
the
main
headlines
refer
to
the
mass
march
of
certain
persons,
predominantly
negro
who
are
marching
in
groups
of
thousands
of
persons
on
washington
d.c.,
the
capital
of
this
country,
in
protest
and
to
demonstrate.
certainly,
but
no
orderly
purpose
other
than
to
show
some
type
of
brute
or
political
strength.
respondent
urges
that
such
a
demonstration
and
protest
is
an
unlawful
assembly.
now,
this,
of
course,
is
quite
irrelevant
to
this
proceeding.
but
i
think
it
shows
the
state
of
mind
of
the
public
officials
of
tallahassee.
they
were
--
it
is
clear
that
anything
that
the
petitioners
did
in
this
case,
anything
they
did
at
all,
their
mere
presence
in
an
integrated
group
would
have
--
would
have
been
flamed
the
community
and
they
were
going
to
arrest
them.
the
same
thing
happened
in
our
--
one
of
our
previous
cases,
taylor
against
louisiana,
where
the
negroes
in
the
bus
station
at
shreveport
--
i
think
the
only
other
freedom
right
case
that
has
come
to
this
court
on
the
merits,
the
same
type
of
situation
arose.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
spoken
in
garner
against
louisiana
on
a
similar
type
situation
where
the
guinea
pig
becomes
the
crime
--
the
committer
of
the
crime
because
he
is
roasted.
this
is
really
what
have
comes
down
to.
mr.
rhodes
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
was
his
view
that
when
in
the
opinion
of
those
carrying
out
the
ordinance,
the
assemblage
would
tend
to
create
a
disturbance
that
becomes
unlawful.
we
suggest,
and
i
suggest
in
closing,
that
if
these
were
the
law,
we
would
have
a
literal
police
state
in
the
united
states.
i
think
the
cases
of
this
court,
as
well
as
in
many
other
higher
courts,
have
previously
decided
that
there
is
a
right
upon
the
part
of
the
citizen
to
refuse
to
obey
an
illegal
order
of
a
police
official.
since
no
acts
of
any
kind
are
shown
in
this
record
of
any
illegal
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
petitioners,
i
think
based
upon
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
that
the
petitioners
had
the
right
to
refuse,
to
obey
the
illegal
order
of
the
policemen.
if
they
do
not
have
that
right,
then
we
have
a
police
state.
with
that,
i
trust
the
court
will
forgive
if
i
don't
use
all
the
time
that
is
available
to
us
but
we
will
perhaps
exercise
that
right
by
the
supplementary
memorandum.
i
wish
to
thank
the
court
for
the
opportunity
herein.
