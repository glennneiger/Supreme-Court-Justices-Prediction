has
that
been
authorized
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words
you
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
your
point
here,
i
think,
is
that
even
if
there's
room
for
material
to
be
filed
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
arbitrator
will
hear
your
argument

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
is
your
argument
(inaudible)
involve
collective
bargaining
and
suppose
they
didn't
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

well,
from
the
application
--
justice
arthur
j.

application
form.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
scanlan,
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
to
come
and
to
see
if
they
didn't
have
a
bargain
and
you're
now
bargaining
your
rights
to
present
it
and
that's
going
to
be
entered
by
the
conditional
(inaudible)
you
did
argue
here
the
right
to
have
him
(inaudible)
separately.
you
had
progression
from
(inaudible)
and
the
question
is
whether
they
didn't
want
to
view
and,
when
the
dispute
is
over,
the
application
at
that
time
for
arbitration
as
a
bargaining
agreement.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
assume
you
likely
will
not
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
scanlan,
isn't
this
--
doesn't
this
place
the
argument
of
getting
a
lot
of
strong
men,
aren't
there
two
separate
disparate
issues
involved
here,
a
lawsuit
here?
for
example,
no-strike
clause,
look
at
page
8.
there
may
be
some
various
relationships
on
that.
the
issues
are
tribal
in
different
forms
and
on
different
languages.
they
take
the
no-strike
clause.
in
the
no-strike
clause,
the
union
shall
not
call
or
sanction
any
slowdown,
work
stoppage,
or
strike.
now,
the
issue
on
your
counterclaim
would
then
be
that
if
the
union
called
or
sanctioned.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
in
the
arbitration,
even
if
the
union
didn't
call
or
sanction
the
strike,
even
if
the
union
did
not
call
the
strike,
you
would
still
reach
your
case
suppose
the
arbitrator
assumes
the
employee
walked
out,
if
the
employee
walked
out.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
the
court
explains
that,
under
this
provision,
an
employee
who
walks
out,
whether
the
union
sanctioned
it
or
not,
the
employee
walks
out
under
--
without
the
--
under
this
provision,
he
commits
a
violation
of
the
contract
and
could
not
make
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
the
(inaudible)
now.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
lawsuit
stands
on
a
different
box
from
their
grievances
and
your
winning
the
lawsuit
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
or
may
not
have
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
you
have
maintained
the
theory
of
why
judgment
against
the
union
if
one
employee
walked
out
without
the
union's
permission.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
is
a
problem
(inaudible)
every
labor
contract,
we
know
by
practical
experience
and
results
of
arbitration,
that
no
finding
