mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
the
court
please.
this
comes
to
this
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
that
court
affirmed
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court,
circuit
court
of
woodbury
county,
iowa,
to
the
effect
that
the
union's
participation
or
the
employees'
participation
in
a
walkout
can
be
effect
of
waiving
the
right
of
the
union
to
require
the
employer
to
arbitrate
discharges
which
arose
in
the
context
of
the
walkout.
as
the
matter
came
to
the
iowa
supreme
court,
it
came
there
by
way
of
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court
under
a
rule
of
the
iowa
rules
of
civil
procedure,
rule
105,
which
is
a
rule
that
appears
to
be
designed
to
make
it
possible
for
rulings
of
law,
final
determinations
of
law
to
be
made
in
advance
of
disposition
of
the
entire
case
where
the
facts
which
raise
the
issue
of
law
are
not
contraverted.
as
the
case
commenced,
it
was
a
proceeding
by
the
union
to
require
the
employer
to
arbitrate
grievances
which
the
union
had
presented
under
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
were
two
grievances.
one
was
the
discharge
of
one
employee
and
the
second
grievance
had
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
approximately
190
other
employees.
insofar
as
the
record
discloses
the
facts
from
which
these
disputes
arose,
it
discloses
a
set
of
facts
very
similar
to
the
facts
in
the
enterprise
wheel
case
which
was
before
this
court
in
1960.
there
seems
to
have
been
a
dispute
between
an
employee
and
someone
in
management.
that
employee
was
discharged
and
then
a
significant
number
of
other
employees
walked
off
the
job,
presumably
in
sympathy
in
protest.
so
that,
the
question
that
is
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
employees,
and
possibly
of
the
union
as
well,
precludes
the
union
from
requiring
the
employer
to
arbitrate
the
disputes
under
the
provisions
of
an
arbitration
clause
which
is
certainly
as
broad
as
the
arbitration
clauses
that
were
before
this
court
in
the
steel
workers
cases.
the
arbitration
clause
contains
the
language
"disputes
with
reference
to
the
proper
interpretation
or
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract."
it's
our
contention
that,
notwithstanding
what
appears
to
have
been
possibly
illegal
conduct
under
the
contract
by
the
employees
and
the
union,
that
the
question
of
the
discharges,
whether
they
were
for
just
cause,
is
a
question
which
should
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
say,
in
the
factual
situation
that
you
put,
justice
goldberg,
that
the
employees
would
be
required
through
their
union
to
submit
that
matter
to
arbitration.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
don't
think
they
could
strike
without
running
a
serious
risk
of
violating
the
no-strike
clause
unless,
first,
they
had
endeavored,
rather
diligently,
to
have
the
matter
determined
by
an
arbitrator.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
say
that
there
is
room
but
i
think
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
and
very
exceptional
case.
the
only
decision
that
i
think
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with,
which
represents
an
instance
in
which
the
relationships
between
the
parties
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
it
was
probably
proper
to
say
that
no
contract
remained,
was
judge
nordbye's
opinion
in
the
minnesota
joint
board
case.
i
don't
think
that
situation
is
presented
here,
nor
do
i
think
that
that
situation
is
the
situation
that
post
in
your
hypothetical
question.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
don't
think
that
there
was,
no.
that
would
be
my
point,
yes.i
think
perhaps
the
problem
is
created
for
the
courts
by
the
somewhat
ambiguous
meaning
of
the
term
"arbitrability".
i'm
sure
that
there
is
no
question
but
what
initially
the
term
"arbitrability"
is
a
--
an
issue
which
has
to
be
considered
by
the
court.
but,
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
has
instructed
the
lower
courts
that
they
are
simply
to
concern
themselves
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
dispute
presented
appears
to
be
one
on
the
face
of
the
contract
and
the
face
of
the
arbitration
clause
that
the
parties
bargain
should
go
to
the
arbitrator.
here,
however,
we
have
an
additional
reason
urged,
not
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
an
additional
reason
urged
why
these
grievances
should
not
go
to
arbitration,
the
reason
being
the
claim
to
misconduct
of
the
union.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
something
in
the
nature
of
an
affirmative
assertion
or
allegation,
perhaps
even
an
affirmative
defense,
which
for
a
court
to
decide
would
necessitate
the
hearing
of
evidence,
a
consideration
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
strike,
the
consideration
to
what
extent
the
officials
of
the
union
participated
in
the
walkout,
either
encouraged
it
or
stood
by
and
did
nothing
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
contract,
in
its
wording,
in
the
arbitration
clause
appears
to
be
such
that
the
dispute
hear
a
discharge
should
go
to
arbitration,
that
that
issue
of
arbitrability,
properly
a
judicial
question,
can
be
determined
without
the
hearing
of
any
evidence
which
may
bare
upon
what
i've
described
as
in
the
nature
of
an
affirmative
defense
to
it.i
would
say
that
when
the
matter
goes
to
the
arbitrator,
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
at
that
point
for
the
employer
to
assert
that,
by
reason
of
the
wrongful
misconduct
of
the
union,
it
should
not
have
the
benefits
of
arbitration
in
that
particular
case.
or,
another
type
of
affirmative
assertion
that
might
be
made
is
that,
notwithstanding
what
appears
to
be
the
language
of
the
arbitration
clause,
the
history
of
bargaining
over
the
years
indicates
quite
clearly
that
the
particular
kind
of
dispute
which
has
arisen
is
one
that
the
parties
previously
had
come
to
an
understanding,
although
not
expressed
in
writing,
should
not
be
heard
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
the
arbitrator
could
hear
and
pass
upon
the
very
argument
which
the
respondent
is
making
in
this
court
and
wants
the
courts
to
pass
upon,
and
i
think
it
would
require
--
before
the
issue
could
be
decided,
it
would
require
a
full
hearing
of
the
evidence
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
events
which
lead
to
the
discharges.
the
difficulty,
it
seems
to
us,
in
having
a
court
pass
on
these
issues,
as
the
iowa
courts
did,
without
hearing
evidence
but
simply
on
the
face
of
the
pleading
is
it's
extremely
difficult
for
a
court
to
consider
as
a
defense
to
the
question
of
arbitrability
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
strike
without
coming
perilously
close
to
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
just
cause
for
discharge.
i
believe,
conceptually,
you
can
separate
the
two
issues.
you
can
say
that
one
issue
is
simply
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
conduct
is
of
such
a
nature
that
the
contract
relationship
has
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
the
employer
is
no
longer
bound
to
arbitrate
the
dispute.
i
think
that
is
an
issue
which
could
be
posed
and,
apart
from
the
evidentiary
problems,
probably
could
be
passed
on
by
a
court,
but
what
appears
to
us
to
be
the
inherent
difficulty
of
the
question
is
that
once
a
court
enters
upon
that,
i
think
it
is
extraordinarily
hard
for
it
not
virtually
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
just
cause
for
the
discharge.
i
say
questions
conceptually
are
separate,
but
the
evidence
and
the
arguments
which
would
go
to
the
decision
of
the
two
questions
are
so
closely
related
that
once
a
court
determines
that
it
may
properly
decide
whether
this
particular
affirmative
defense
to
the
petition
to
seeking
arbitration
is
a
good
one
or
not,
it
almost
inevitably
is
going
to
be
entrenching
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
discharges
which
are
the
heart
of
grievances
were
for
proper
cause
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
because,
obviously,
in
some
situations,
arbitrators
will
hold
that
employees
walking
off
the
job
without
proper
justification
may
be
discharged
and
that
that
action
of
employees
constitutes
just
cause.
but,
that
question
is
so
closely
related
to
the
question
which
is
here
urged
as
a
defense
to
arbitration
at
all.
is
so
closely
related
--
these
two
questions
are
so
closely
related
that
i
do
not
see
how
a
court,
mindful
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
the
limited
function
that
the
court
is
to
engage
in,
can
decide
one
question
with
almo
--
out
almost
inevitably
deciding
the
other.
so
that,
it
seems
to
me,
that
perhaps
the
problem
can
be
helped
some
and
the
issue
clarified
some
for
the
guidance
of
lower
courts.
if
it
is
recognized
that,
initially,
arbitrability
is
for
the
court
to
decide
on
the
face
of
the
contract
and
the
language
which
the
parties
have
used
but
that,
once
the
matter
goes
to
the
arbitrator,
there
may
be
much
more
detailed
considerations
which
the
arbitrator
may
consider
and
which
may
lead
the
arbitrator
to
conclude
that,
in
this
particular
circumstance,
the
conduct
of
one
party
or
the
other
precludes
it
from
having
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
grievance
finally
determined
by
way
of
arbitration,
so
that
there
may
be
two
levels
of
the
issue
of
abitrability.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
because,
i
think,
there
is
--
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
of
which,
obviously,
would
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board,
namely,
whether
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
nowe,
the
second
question
might
well
be
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
contract.
and,
i
think
those
two
questions
are
separate
even
though
the
facts
and
circumstances
bearing
on
the
two
questions
may
be
very,
very
similar,
if
not
identical.
as
i
understand
respondent's
argument
here,
it
is
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
comparable
to
that
in
drake
bakeries
because
the
arbitration
clause
here
is
narrower
and,
conceitedly,
it
is.
in
drake
bakeries,
of
course,
the
arbitration
clause
was
so
broad
that
this
court
held
that
the
employer
had
agreed
by
the
provisions
of
that
arbitration
clause
to
have
to
go
to
arbitration
even
the
question
as
to
whether
the
union
should
be
required
to
pay
damages
for
breach
of
contract
by
engaging
in
a
strike.
there's
no
question
that
the
arbitration
clause
here
does
not
go
nearly
so
far.
the
arbitration
clause
here,
first
of
all,
is
concerned
with
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
and
the
only
kind
of
issues
which
can
go
to
it
are
those
which
the
union
asks
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
--
i
think
it
would
if
the
issue
arose
in
the
context
of
a
grievance.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
which
this
did.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that's
correct.
if
it
arose
in
a
different
context,
it
might
be
an
issue
which
would
not
probably
be
one
to
go
to
the
arbitrator.
but,
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
quite
clear,
since
the
employers
filed
a
counterclaim
and
since
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
employer
has
a
right
to
have
that
counterclaim
heard
by
the
court
and
determined,
that
the
employer
retains
his
judicial
remedy
for
any
breach
of
contract
by
the
union
and
he
has
a
right
to
sue,
under
section
301,
and
pursue
that
remedy.
and,
he
has
not
given
up
that
remedy
by
virtue
of
this
particular
contract,
whereas,
in
the
drake
bakeries
case,
he
had
agreed
to
give
up
a
court
remedy
for
that
type
of
violation.
consequently,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasoning
applicable
in
the
drake
bakeries
case
is
just
as
strongly
in
favor
of
having
this
issue
go
to
arbitration,
the
grievances
here,
as
in
the
drake
bakeries
case,
not
withstanding
the
difference
in
the
two
arbitration
clauses
and
for
this
reason.
in
this
case,
the
employer
retains
his
remedy.
he
has
filed
a
counter
claim
asking
for
damages
in
the
court.
that
counter
claim
is
not
proceeding
at
the
present
time
because
all
proceedings
in
the
iowa
court
have
been
stayed,
pending
the
determination
of
these
issues,
so
that
he
has
not
restricted
himself
to
have
questions
as
to
the
violation
of
contract
by
the
union
which
may
lead
to
his
right
to
damages.
he
still
has
his
court
remedy
and
is
not
compelled
to
have
that
question
heard
by
the
arbitrator.
so
that,
when
the
respondent
indicates
that,
by
reason
of
the
narrower
arbitration
clause
here,
it
is
not
broad
enough
to
concern
itself
for
the
question
of
walkouts
and
strikes
amounting
to
substantial
breach,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
clarify
that
assertion
and
indicate
that,
in
part,
what
the
respondent
says
is
correct
but,
impart,
what
he
says
is
incorrect.
he
is
correct
insofar
as
he
is
interpreting
this
contract
and
this
arbitration
clause
as
not
requiring
the
employer
to
arbitrate
any
claim
for
damages
he
may
have
by
reason
of
the
conduct
to
the
union.
but,
it
seems
to
us,
he
is
incorrect
insofar
as
he
indicates
that
this
arbitration
clause
would
not
permit
the
arbitrator
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
strike,
action
or
walkout
action
by
the
union,
precluded
the
type
of
remedy
which
the
union
seeks
to
arbitration.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
consider
in
what
context
the
issue
was
to
be
decided
and,
if
it's
in
the
context
to
have
a
claim
for
damages,
then,
obviously,
that
should
be
heard
by
the
court.
if
it's
in
the
context
of
a
claim
that
employees
were
improperly
discharged,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
the
issue
is
properly
one
here
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
on
the
pleadings,
the
union
denied
that
there
was
a
strike,
admitted
that
there
was
a
walkout.
i
think,
there
--
there
may
be
a
rough
and
ready
distinction
between
the
two
in
this
respect.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
it
called
or
authorized
or
encouraged
the
strike.
that
is
correct.
it
admits
that
a
substantial
number
of
employees
walked
off.
there
are
two
questions
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
a
rough
and
ready
distinction
between
them.
i
thought
i
had
touched
upon
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
a
walkout,
as
admitted
by
the
union,
would
simply
be
the
factual
situation
in
which
a
number
of
employees
left
their
places
of
work
and
went
out
on
the
street
and
left
the
plant.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
it
called
or
authorized
that
walkout.
that's
correct.
and,
i
would
say
that
if
the
union
had
called
or
authorized
it,
that
it
would
be
more
proper
to
use
the
term
"strike"
and
that's
why
--
what
i
meant
by
saying
there's
a
rough
and
ready
distinction.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
concede,
your
honor,
that
there
were
might
be
a
stronger
argument
against
arbitration,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that
even
if
there
were
a
strike
here,
given
the
period
of
time
covered
by
the
events
as
disclosed
by
the
record,
the
policy
of
the
federal
labor
laws,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
would
be
better
served
by
having
the
question
of
the
discharges
go
to
the
arbitrator
and
let
him
decide
whether
there
was
any
justification
in
the
context
to
the
situation
here
for
what
the
employees
did
rather
than
to
have
it
be
decided
as
a
kind
of
threshold
question
when
the
issue
of
arbitrability
comes
out.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
say
that
it's
enough
to
require
arbitration
but
i
would
not
want
to
be
placed
in
the
position
of
saying
that,
even
if
that
had
engaged
in
what
could
more
properly
be
called
a
strike
and
had
authorized
some
such
action,
that
there
should
be
no
arbitration
because
i
think
that,
in
the
context
and
the
actual
conditions
which
prevail
in
the
industry
today,
there
are
many
situations,
very
short-lived
strikes,
and
the
issues
which
developed
in
those
strikes
and
around
those
strikes
are
probably
better
solved
through
arbitration
than
they
are
through
court
proceeds.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
agree
with
that,
except,
as
i
indicated,
i
think
there
may
be
some
few
extreme
cases
in
which
--
such
as
the
one
i
would
suspect
that
judge
nordbye
was
concerned
with
in
minnesota
in
which
the
relationship
had
completely
collapsed
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
it's
ever
coming
back
together
again.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
notice
is
what
you
are
referring
to,
has
to
do
with
the
communication
that
was
sent
about
four
days
after
the
walkout,
and
i
believe
that
that
is,
the
employer
does
interpret
that
as
an
indication
that
he
is,
regarding
the
activity
of
the
union
as
such,
that
he
is
justified
in
completely
terminating
all
obligations
under
the
contract,
and
that
occurred
four
days
after
the
walkout.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
yes,
i
believe
they
are
and
our
answer
to
that
would
be
that,
notwithstanding
the
position
taken
by
the
company,
whether
it
had
the
right
to
this
so
as
to
cut
off
all
rights
of
the
employees
is
a
matter
that
should
go
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
of
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
correct.
that
would
be
our
position.
now,
preliminarily,
there
are
two
issues
which
have
been
raised
which
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on.
the
respondent
contends
that
the
judgment
of
the
iowa
court
is
not
a
final
judgment
and,
therefore,
is
not
reviewable
by
this
court
under
section
1257.
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
the
practical
terms
and
using
the
practical
test
which
this
court
has
employed
in
many
cases,
the
judgment
below
is
final.
the
only
thing
that
remains
undisposed
off
is
the
respondent's
counter
claim
for
damages.
now,
admittedly,
that
counter
claim
for
damages,
if
and
when
it
goes
to
trial,
will
involve
a
lot
of
questions
that
are
very
similar
to
the
questions
that
would
be
involved
before
an
arbitrator
in
connection
with
these
grievances
but,
so
far
as
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
obtain
arbitration
is
concerned,
the
judgment
of
the
iowa
court
puts
an
end
to
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
except
in
the
remote
circumstance
that
respondents
--
respondent
suggests,
namely,
after
a
trial
of
a
counterclaim.
if
they
were
determined
that
the
petitioner
had
not
violated
the
no-strike
clause,
then
the
petitioner
could
ask
the
iowa
court
to
change
its
and
reopen
its
decision
and,
at
that
point,
perhaps
order
arbitration.
i
agree
that
that
is
a
hypothetical
possibility
but
it's
so
remote
as
a
practical
matter
and
it's
so
remote
in
time
that,
if
arbitration
were
to
be
ordered
some-two
or
three
years
from
now,
after
a
trial
of
counterclaim,
it
seems
to
me,
would
have
no
work
whatsoever.
and,
furthermore,
as
far
as
any
further
proceedings
in
the
iowa
courts
are
concerned,
we
took
the
matter
to
the
iowa
supreme
court.
there's
no
place
else
in
iowa
to
go,
so
that
it
is
a
determination
of
an
issue
in
this
case,
finally,
by
the
highest
court
in
iowa
that
can
pass
on
the
matter.
secondly,
there
is,
urged
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
contention
that
there
are
certain
undenied
allegations
in
an
amendment
that
--
or
an
answer
that
respondent
filed
to
an
amendment
to
the
petition.
i
endeavor
to
cover
that
matter
in
the
brief.
under
iowa
law,
where
the
issues
are
properly
framed
by
a
complaint
or
a
petition
and
an
answer,
a
reply
is
not
necessary.
a
reply
or
a
responsive
pleading
following
an
answer
under
iowa
law
is
necessary
only
if
the
answer
raises
new
issues.
and,
in
connection
with
the
strike,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
alleged
strike,
the
number
of
people
who
left
their
jobs,
the
matter
of
the
picket
line,
and
so
on,
those
issues
were
all
properly
raised
and
fully
raised
by
the
pleadings
prior
to
the
amendment
which
respondent
asserts
we
did
not
respond
to
or
did
not
answer.
so
that
it
would
be
our
contention
that,
on
the
pleadings,
no
further
pleading
was
necessary
and
that
this
court
could
not
properly
take
as
undenied
the
allegations
that
were
contained
in
the
amendment
to
the
answer
which
the
respondent
filed.
there
is
a
--
the
iowa
supreme
court
never
dealt
with
that
because
the
matter
was
not
raised
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
prior
to
the
brief
filed
by
respondent
in
this
court.
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
i
have
just
a
minute
left,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
i
wanted
to
address
myself
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
that's
the
question
which
has
not
yet
been
determined.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
certainly
been
suggested,
there's
a
real
problem
there.
on
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
i
think
it's
a
tossup
as
to
whether
a
state
court
could
issue
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
right,
or
whether
it
couldn't.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
question
is
directly
been
posed
by
recognized
as
a
real
problem,
but
it
was
not
attempted
here.
i
want
to
address
myself,
if
i
might,
briefly
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
black
raised
as
to
the
fact
that
there
would
be
apparently
two
separate
procedures
followed
and
they
might
proceed
simultaneously
or
one
might
go
ahead
first
and
wait
on
the
other.
i
see
no
reason
why
the
arbitration
could
not
proceed
simultaneously
with
the
counterclaim
which
the
respondent
has
for
damages
pending
in
the
iowa
courts.
and,
i
see
nothing
inherent
in
the
situation
to
make
it
impossible
to
have
a
judgment
awarded
to
respondent
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract
and,
at
the
same
time,
have
an
arbitrator
conclude
that
discharge
was
perhaps
too
extreme
a
penalty
to
impose
on
certain
of
the
employees.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think,
although
the
factual
circumstances
upon
which
the
arbitrator
and
the
court
would
base
a
decision
are
substantially
the
same,
the
precise
issue
which
each
must
decide
is
different.
the
arbitrator
must
decide
whether,
under
the
circumstances,
there
was
just
cause
for
discharge.
the
court
must
decide
whether
the
union
violated
the
contract
by
participating
in,
sanctioning,
or
calling
the
strike.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
the
court
could
make
a
different
decision.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
but
i
think
the
arbitrator
decides
it
in
a
context
in
which
it
is
not
bound
to
nearly
the
same
extent
by
traditional
notions
as
to
evidence
and
as
to
just
what
could
be
introduced
in
the
court
of
law.
i
think
there
are
many
things
the
arbitrator
might
take
into
account
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
such
as
the
context
of
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
it
might,
in
a
given
situation,
lead
to
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
but
i
don't
think
the
way
the
law
and
the
procedures
now
exist
that
there's
any
reason
why
both
the
arbitration
and
the
court
proceeding
should
not
proceed
as
it
were
on
parallel
rails.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
in
this
situation,
that
could
not
arise,
mr.
justice
black,
because,
here,
all
we
are
seeking
is
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
reinstatement.
now,
i
suppose
that
came
with
the
damages.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
don't
think
we'll
deprive
them
of
the
right.
