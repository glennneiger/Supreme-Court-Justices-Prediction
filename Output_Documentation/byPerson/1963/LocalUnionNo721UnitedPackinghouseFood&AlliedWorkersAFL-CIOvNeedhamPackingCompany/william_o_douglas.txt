justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
scanlan,
look
at
the
other
side.
suppose
the
iowa
court,
on
the
trial
of
the
counterclaim,
decides
that
there
was
--
the
union
did
not
authorize
a
strike
or
a
walkout.
it
had
no
part
in
it.
just
assume
that.
then,
would
the
union
--
then,
could
the
union
go
to
arbitration?
