justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
what,
in
your
judgment,
would
happen
if
it's
held
that
this
has
to
go
to
arbitration
with
reference
to
your
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
read
their
brief
and
i
can't
understand
exactly
what
they
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
this
man
should
embark
on
the
field
that
we
have
in
interstate
commerce
commission
other
agencies
in
dividing
a
lawsuit
into
two
parts,
one
in
which
the
courts
can
decide
and
one
which
the
arbitrators
can
decide,
so
that
that
can
be
sent
back
to
the
court
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
the
contention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
--
what
other
way
would
it
be?
how
can
you
preserve
your
right
to
sue
unless
that's
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
scanlan,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
evidently
departed
considerably
from
what
i
had
in
mind.
the
question
i
ask
is
this.
some
years
ago,
i
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
which
a
matter
had
been
referred
to
the
icc
while
a
case
was
pending.
it
took
about
eight
years
for
that
thing
to
be
decided
because
you
had
to
wait
for
the
icc
to
decide
that
part
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
law
that
it
had
to
decide,
and
then
the
rest
had
to
come
back
to
us.
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
on
this.
i
understand
they
say
you
have
your
lawsuit
still.
if
you
have
your
lawsuit
still,
does
that
mean
that
you
--
the
case
can
wait
there
until
the
arbitrator
decides
these
questions
given
to
his
jurisdiction
then
it
comes
back
to
the
court
for
it
to
decide
the
lawsuit?
what
happens
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
happens
if
they
win
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
to
your
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
counterclaim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
do
that,
you'd
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
wait.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
the
case,
you'd
have
to
wait.
if
--
if
they're
part
of
the
thing
that
the
arbitrator
can
decide
but
initially
after
you'd
approve
your
case,
and
i
don't
know
whether
that's
the
case
or
not,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
would
have
to
wait.
but,
suppose
the
court
holds
that
there
are
some
other
things
that
are
--
that
the
arbitrator
must
decide
and
it
turns
out
that
they
are
essential
for
the
court
to
determine
in
some
way
in
your
case.
does
the
court
wait
for
the
arbitrator
to
exercise
his
judgment
in
that
matter
or
does
he
go
along
and
render
judgment
which
is
quite
different
as
to
what
is
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
it.
now,
suppose
the
arbitrator
is
the
only
one
who
can
determine
under
this
contract
whether
that's
a
strike,
and
that's
an
element
to
be
a
proof
in
your
case.
does
the
court
have
to
wait
until
the
arbitrator
makes
that
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
suit
began.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
it
--
of
course
it
should,
if
the
arbitrator
has
the
right
to
decide
some
things
that
are
of
necessary
importance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
enters
into
the
--
my
consideration
of
the
problem
is
to
how
far
arbitration
can
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
enforcing
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
just
because
i
just
don't
understand
quite
from
the
facts
here.
assume
that
you
are
asking
to
have
arbitrated
something
with
reference
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
as
applied
to
the
conduct
involved
where
you
ask
the
ar
--
for
arbitration
of
that
and
the
final
decision
on
it,
and
you
get
it
in
your
favor,
and
suppose
that
same
issue
has
to
be
solved
by
the
court.
it's
trying
the
suit
for
damages.
which
governs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
but,
suppose
in
--
suppose
the
union's
claim
of
the
grievance
claim
was
under
contract
where
he
could
not
recover
if
the
strike
was
unjustified,
and
that
was
decided
there,
and
the
court
had
a
case
damage
suit
pending
where
the
continuous
claiming
damage
is
on
the
ground
that
the
strike
was
unjustified.
would
the
arbitrator's
decision
be
final
or
could
the
court
make
a
different
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
little
contrary
to
the
rule
we've
had
with
reference
to
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
various
agencies,
and
i
don't
say
that
it
should
apply
but
it's
the
problem
that
worry
me
in
connection
with
the
arbitrator
deciding
some
of
the
same
things
that
would
be
involved
in
the
right
to
sue
which
congress
has
given
for
bridge
of
the
contract,
whether
rightful
or
wrongful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
just
a
pretty
bad
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
be
a
pretty
bad
situation,
and
i
think
that's
a
great
responsibility
for
the
rule
that's
involved
of
that
agency,
to
have
one
agency
which
the
government
has
selected
decide
the
thing
one
way
and
award
damages
to
one
group
on
the
basis
that
it
means
this
and
the
court
come
in
and
award
damages
to
the
other
side
for
exactly
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
that
be
a
pretty
bad
governmental
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
asking
then,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
not
asking
the
court
to
say
that
the
employer
loses
his
full
right
to
sue
under
301.
he
can
prove
his
facts
satisfactory
to
the
judge
even
though
an
arbitrator
may
have
awarded
damages
to
the
other
side
by
a
precisely
arbitrated
interpretation
of
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
lacking
in
this
case.
it's
lacking
in
this
case
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
in
it
or
not.
i've
just
read
the
pleading.
it
seems
to
me
like
your
right
of
recovery
under
your
grievance
depends,
to
a
large
extent,
on
proof
of
facts
which
would
deprive
the
other
people
of
a
right
to
recover
under
that
301
proceeding.
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
that.
