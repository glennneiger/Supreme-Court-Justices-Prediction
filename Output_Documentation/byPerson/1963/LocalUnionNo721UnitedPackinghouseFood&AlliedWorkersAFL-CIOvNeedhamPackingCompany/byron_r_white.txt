justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
argument
broad
enough
to
cover
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
strike
--
whether
or
not
the
contract
allows
the
employer
to
repudiate
for
an
unauthorized
strike?
it's
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
which
this
one
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
be
different
--
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
this
employer
were
--
had
brought
a
suit
for
damages
and
the
union
countered
and
asked
a
stay
in
order
to
send
the
--
to
put
the
damage
claim
on
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
had
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
called
or
authorized.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
or
don't
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
fact
that
the
union
denies
having
called
or
authorized
the
strike
is,
of
itself,
enough
to
require
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
assume
then
this
is
the
non-arbitrable
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
scanlan,
(inaudible)
don't
you
think
that
this
matter
had
been
dealt
with
in
atkinson?
it's
the
very
question
we
were
having
discussion
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
as
i
understood,
you've
got
the
counterclaim
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
that
this
is
the
same
question
as
i
think
justice
goldberg
asked
you
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
(inaudible)
the
arbitrator
manage
to
award?
it
makes
no
reference
on
what
he
should
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
if
that
could
be
interpreted
as
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
scanlan,
if
he
was
(inaudible)
why
is
no
one's
arbitration
taken?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
turned
arbitration
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
union
did
have
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
proceedings
pretty
much
covers
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
proceedings
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
for
the
arbitrators
agreed
that
he
should
stop.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
employer
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
arbitrating.
arbitrating
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
not
what
an
arbitrator
really
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
just
about
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
