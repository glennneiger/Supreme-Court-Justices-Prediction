mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
before
addressing
myself
to
the
three
points
that
are
involved
this
case,
namely,
the
jurisdictional
issue,
then
the
merits,
and
then
the
final
question
touched
upon
by
mr.
watt
whether
the
record
in
this
case
permits
a
factual
basis
for
the
legal
conclusions
reached
by
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
i
would
like
briefly
just
to
touch
on
some
points
that
had
been
covered
in
part
but
perhaps
not
fully
illuminated
by
mr.
watt's
presentation.
first,
and
there's
no
argument
here,
the
union
has
conceded
below,
concedes
here,
and
mr.
watt
again
has
conceded
in
argument
the
employer's
right
to
sue
over
the
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause.
that
in
a
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
as
a
concept,
at
least
as
he
put
it,
is
a
non-arbitrable
matter.
thus,
from
the
beginning,
we
don't
have
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
drake
and
in
atkinson.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
that's
--
the
claim
for
damages,
mr.
justice
white,
for
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
is
a
non-arbitrable
matter.
therefore,
we
don't
have
the
problem
this
court
had
to
wrestle
within
drake
and
in
atkinson,
for
that
matter,
to
determine
whether
the
breach
was
included
under
or
out
of
the
arbitrational
clause.
also,
as
in
atkinson,
and
unlike
drake,
only
the
union
could
petition
for
a
grievance.
and,
finally,
the
--
and
this
point
i
don't
think
has
been
touched
upon,
the
no-strike
clause
in
this
case
is
much
broader
than
the
no-strike
clause
in
atkinson.
in
atkinson,
actually,
the
union
had
a
right
to
strike
over
matters
that
were
not
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure,
provided
they
gave
notice.
here,
on
the
record
at
pages
8
and
9
where
the
no-strike
clause
is
set
forth,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
bars
all
strikes
and
walkouts
and
work
stoppages.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
no-strike
clause,
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
light
of
the
shaky
denials
that
the
union
persists
in
that
they
didn't
call,
sanctioned,
or
support
the
strike,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
this
court's
determination
of
this
case
because
the
no-strike
clause
finds
both
the
employees
and
the
union,
it
says
it
has
agreed
that,
during
the
period
of
the
agreement,
the
employee
shall
not
engage
in
and
the
union
shall
not
call
or
sanction
any
slowdown,
work
stoppage,
or
strike.
and,
we're
talking
here
about
the
reinstatement
of
the
employees
who
walked
out,
so
whether
or
not
the
iowa
court
went
beyond
the
permissible
realm
of
judicial
notice
and
pierce
the
pleadings
to
find
that
the
union
was
supporting
the
strike,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we'll
deal
with
it
as
a
walkout
by
these
191
employees.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
in
the
production
gang?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
--
i
believe,
your
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
think
it
was
205.
i
think,
the
first
day,
they
all
walked
out
but
a
few
came
back.
now,
there's
no
question
here
that
the
walkout
was
over
an
economic
dispute,
a
matter
that
was
subject
to
grievance.
their
own
pleadings,
their
application
for
appeal
tell
you
what
it
is.
it
was
an
assigning
supervisory
employees
to
the
production
gang,
to
the
production
line.
it's
clearly
a
matter
that
was
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
that's
what
the
initial
walkout
was
all
about
--
i
mean,
the
initial
discharge
or
walkout
by
the
first
employee,
stamoulis.
now,
unlike
atkinson,
when
we
filed
the
counterclaim
in
the
iowa
court,
they
did
not
move
to
stay
the
counterclaim
and,
i
think
it's
fairly
conceded
right
along
that
the
issues
involved
at
the
trial
of
the
counterclaim
are
inextricably
bound
up
with
they're
--
i
forget
the
exact
phrase
used
by
the
appellant,
but
they're
practically
inseparable
and
they
are,
they're
basically,
whether
the
walkout
was
justified.
i
assume
if
the
walkout
was
unjustified,
the
management
wasn't
perhaps
justified
in
treating
the
no-strike
clause
as
breached
but
the
issues
are
there
back
in
iowa
in
the
counterclaim,
the
same
issues
that
mr.
watt
would
send
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
it.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
--
i'm
not
clear
on
that,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
watt
agrees
that
we
have
the
right
to
sue
for
the
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
but,
since
the
issues
raised
there
are
also
raised
by
their
grievance,
these
are
economic
matters
for
--
as
to
which
an
arbitrator
is
more
qualified
and
more
experienced
to
decide.
they
involve
a
great
deal
of
detailed
pros
and
cons,
and
he
should
decide
them
first.
and,
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well
i
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
characterize
his
contention,
but
i
can
see
it
being
evaluated
that
way.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
agree
with
you.
they
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
--
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
claim
that
atkinson
settled
this
case
in
our
favor,
but
i
don't
think
we
can
read
atkinson
that
way.
our
adversary
circumvent
atkinson
and
the
ruling
there
by
conceding
that
we
can
sue
for
breach
but
they
turn
out
to
be
indian
gurus
because,
after
making
the
concession,
they
come
around
and
say
"but
if
a
grievance
is
alleged,
following
the
walkout
or
the
discharge
which
raises
the
same
issues
as
the
walkout
--
i
mean,
as
the
alleged
breach,
then
this
must
go
to
the
arbitrator."
in
effect,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
know
you
have
justifiable
pride
of
authorship,
his
argument
would
render
--
would
render
drake
bakeries
meaningless.
i
see
the
luncheon
recess
has
arrived
and
i'll
sit
down.
well,
one,
if
the
arbitrator
is
privileged
to
determine
these
questions,
questions
which
have
been
traditionally
determined
by
courts,
too,
the
question
will
be
presented
then,
as
we
come
into
our
--
for
our
counterclaim,
would
the
matter
be
res
adjudicata
in
that
case.
i
would
contend,
no,
they
are
two
different
and
unrelated
causes
of
action,
but
the
problem
exists.
but,
there's
another
aspect
to
the
point
i
think
justice
black
raised.
if
we're
going
to
take
what
are
admittedly
traditional
causes
of
action
for
breach
of
contract,
for
instance,
and
there
are
other
areas,
raising
issue
that
courts
have
traditionally
determined,
under
conditions
of
a
jury
trial,
swearing
of
the
witness,
full
judicial
protections,
and
pass
them
over
on
the
grounds
of
some
alleged
expertise
in
a
situation,
where
i
think
it's
fairly
arguable
the
employer
didn't
bargain
for,
where
the
union
concedes
that
he
attempted
to
preserve
his
right
to
sue.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i'll
say
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
if
his
analysis
is
signed,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
an
employer
never
can
protect
himself
against
avoiding
arbitration
when
there's
been
a
material
breach.
the
suggestion
in
your
earlier
question
that
were
presented
in
this
case,
with
the
possibility
there's
nothing
left
of
the
material
breach
doctrine,
then
will
be
a
fact
and
i
think
that
result
would
be
a
disservice
to
arbitration.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
no,
i
don't
think
you
could.
the
way
i
see
it,
you
--
suppose
this
was
an
expressed
no-strike
clause.
“breach
of
this
no-strike
clause
shall
in
no
way
give
rise
to
issues
that
are
subject
to
arbitration,”
suppose
that
was
written
in
there
very
carefully
by
lawyers.
he
could
still
come
in
here
because,
once
there's
a
walkout
or
striker
--
in
most
cases
where
there's
a
walkout
or
strike
in
violation
of
the
"no-walkout
or
no-strike
clause,"
it's
followed
by
discharges.
the
employer
is
mad.
he
tells
them
“comeback
or
i'll
fire
you.”
he
fires
them.
so,
the
union
then
will
be
able
to
use
arbitration
when
it
wants
to
and
layoff
when
it
does.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
weak
grievance
strike,
maybe
the
employer
will
capitulate.
if
he
doesn't
capitulate
like
he
did
in
here
or
if
the
strike
fizzles,
“alright,
now,
let's
arbitrate.”
it
seems
to
me,
arbitration
then,
your
honor,
will
not
only
be
a
one-way
street.
it
will
be
a
dead-end
for
an
employer.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
it
may
be
possible
that
language
that
i
can't
visualize
that
would
be
acceptable
to
unions
without
bitter
bargaining
could
protect
them.
but,
short
of
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
employer
who
thinks
that
he's
free
from
the
duty
to
arbitrate
because
he
has
a
pretty
firm
no-strike
clause
and
it's
excluded
even
expressly
from
the
arbi
--
the
coverage
of
the
arbitration
clause
can
still
find
himself
subject
to
arbitration
by
the
mere
filing
of
a
grievance
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
that
it
so,
then
the
effort
that
this
court
made,
and
i
think
very
carefully
made,
to
spell
out
the
circumstances
in
drake
bakeries
under
which
a
matter
would
be
held
arbitrable
and
non-arbitrable
and
to
spell
out
the
circumstances
when
a
court
might
legitimately
hold
that
a
union
had
repudiated
its
contract
and
an
employer
was
tra
--
was
entitled
to
treat
it
as
such
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
would
be
meaningless.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
if
i
understand
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
if
i
understand
my
opponent's
argument
correctly,
we
can
proceed
with
our
lawsuit
when
this
matter
gets
back
to
the
iowa
courts,
our
counterclaim,
and
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
our
counterclaim,
our
lawsuit
is
inv
--
is
in
the
cast
in
the
form
of
a
counterclaim,
mr.
justice
black.
we
didn't
start
an
independent
lawsuit.
we
answered
and
then
counterclaimed.
i
would
assume
that,
if
i
read
his
argument
correctly,
we
could
get
judgment
on
our
counterclaim,
although
he
may
then
argue
that
we
would
be
bound
by
the
findings
or
the
award
of
the
arbitrator
on
this
issue
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
--
which
is
the
identi
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
pardon?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
we
maintain
that
it's
not.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
would
say,
if
this
were
a
case
where
the
particular
issue
was
one
of
the
economic
questions,
say,
for
instance,
the
one
that
gave
rise
to
the
dispute
initially,
whether
using
production
--
supervisory
employees
in
the
production
line,
the
court
should
wait
for
a
proceeding
to
comeback
to
it.
but,
if
the
issues
are
the
same
and
the
issues
on
the
court-side
are
the
question
of
whether
they
breached
the
contract
by
a
strike
that
was
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
--
well,
i
may
be
--
that
isn't
the
question
in
our
case.
that
the
issue
that
the
court
has
to
decide
back
in
iowa
is
not
something
peculiar
to
the
expertise
of
an
arbitrator,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
strike
and
whether
or
not
it
was
in
violation
of
a
contractual
provision,
then
i
would
say,
in
our
case,
certainly,
the
court
shouldn't
wait.
it
should
proceed.
actually,
they
didn't
ask
to
stay
the
counterclaim
and
i
suppose
the
courts
could've
moved
ahead
if
we
hadn't
got
down
--
i
would
say
blocked
down,
involved
in
the
appeal
that
is
now
before
your
honors
today.
but,
i
--
very
frankly,
if
it
were
--
if
this
were
a
matter
involving
a
peculiar
economic
issue
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
under
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
--
grievance
procedure.
yes,
if
the
suit
did
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
if
the
suit
did,
i
can
see
the
argument
is
in
favor
of
having
the
court
to
wait
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
pushed
to
the
extent
that
our
opponent's
theory
would
push
it
here,
that
the
mere
allegation
of
a
grievance
concerning
a
walkout,
at
that
moment,
cuts
off
further
court
consideration
of
it
in
a
situation
where
they
concede
that
we
have
a
cause
of
action
that
we
can
pursue
in
the
court.
as
i
say,
they
can
make
this
concession
and
then
they
take
it
back
by
the
argument
they
advance
about
the
grievance.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
makes
the
drake
bakery
opinion,
which
we
think
is
a
sound
opinion
and
a
controlling
opinion,
would
rarely
have
a
set
of
facts
to
which
anyone
could
apply
it
in
following
a
wake
out
--
a
walkout
because
the
grievance
would
be
asserted
and
the
argument
would
be
made.
grievances
are
things
that
arbitrators
are
procurely
equipped
to
determine.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
perhaps
i
cast
it
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
you
there,
justice
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
we're
faced
with
the
one
problem,
whether
the
court
--
suppose
the
arbitrator
comes
up
with
the
finding
that
these
walkouts
were
justified
and
these
men
should
be
taken
back
and
be
p
--
back-wages
paid
to
the
date
of
the
walkout
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
pulls
a
trial
court
or
a
jury
finding
perhaps
that
the
employer
suffered
a
150,000
damages
because
of
the
shrinkage
of
the
cattle
in
the
yards
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
same
set
of
facts,
two
directly
opposing
the
decisions.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
that's
another
difficulty
with
arbitration,
and
i
think
it
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
can't
--
we
can't
be
sure
what
trouble
an
arbitrator's
award
in
this
proceeding
would
have
or
would
--
what
impact
it
would
have
on
our
lawsuit,
but
we're
certain
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
they
could.
i
think,
your
honor,
this
would
happen.
if,
on
the
trial
of
the
counterclaim,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
union
didn't
advocate
the
strike
and
the
men
did
not
walkout,
i
mean,
that's
the
problem
here.
even
if
the
union
didn't
advocate
support
or
sanction
the
strike,
we
still
have
the
case
because
the
employees
walked
out.
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
and
the
clause
--
the
no-strike
clause
applies
to
walkouts
by
the
employees,
as
well
as
strikes
called
by
the
union.
but,
just
to
rephrase
your
question,
if
i
may,
if
the
trial
court
found
that
the
men
were
justified
in
walking
out
on
the
trial
of
a
counterclaim,
our
argument
then
would
be
that,
certainly,
the
union
would
be
free
to
reopen
it
under
appropriate
iowa
procedure
and,
if
that
was
denied,
they
could
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
because,
then,
the
order
would
be
final.
the
whole
controversy
would
be
finished
and,
if
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
denied
that,
they
would
be
back
here.
that
i
think
the
argument
there
is
related
to
the
prematurity
that
we
feel
exists
here.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
question
whether
a
judgment
is
final
is
a
practical
judgment
but
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
and
--
and
the
employees
engaged
in.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
would
hope
so.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh,
i
--
i
agree.
i
think
we'd
have
an
excellent
case.
i
think
we'd
win
arbitration
but
i
think
that
the
law
is
that
there's
a
bit
of
material
breach,
that
there's
certainly
a
circumstance.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it's
possible.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
but
the
fundamental
issue
in
both
of
them,
of
course,
is
whether
the
walkouts
were
justified
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
time
but
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh,
no.
no,
i'm
treating
this
in
the
terms
of
the
191-walkout.
i
--
i
think
the
question
of
whether
the
union
did
or
did
not
sanction
the
strike
is
arguable
under
the
state
of
the
pleadings.
i
think
the
trial
court
of
iowa
and
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
more
familiar
perhaps
with
the
controversy,
were
entitled
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
union,
if
it
didn't
call
it,
it
sanctioned
it.
but,
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
may
i
--
may
i
answer
that,
if
i
can,
mr.
justice
goldberg?
i
agree
that
the
mutually
dependent
covenant
doctrine
is
not
applicable
as
such
to
labor
union
contracts.
i
agree
that
--
i
won't
say
they're
sui
generis
but
they're
certainly
different
than
many
of
the
commercial
contracts
with
which
courts
are
familiar.
but,
they
are
not
that
different
and
the
clauses
that
are
important
to
the
various
parties
are
many,
and
i
don't
argue
that,
in
every
negotiation,
the
no-strike
clause
is
given
in
exchange
for
the
arbitration
clause.
but,
certainly,
the
negotiating
parties
regard
them
as
having
some
correlation.
i
noticed
our
opponents,
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
i
think
at
least
the
two
clauses
have
this
in
common.
both
aim
at
labor
peace,
both
aim
at
continued
production
and
employment,
and
both
of
them
the
no-strike
clause
on
the
one
hand
and
the
arbitration
clause
on
the
other,
represent
a
very
valuable
concession
by
the
respective
party.
for
the
employer,
on
the
arbitration
clause,
he
has
given
up
the
right,
in
effect,
to
manage
his
business
in
a
certain
area.
for
the
union,
by
giving
the
no-strike
no-walkout
clause,
they
surrendered
a
very
valuable
economic
right.
so,
while
they
may
not
be
quid
pro
quo,
and
i
don't
argue
that
they
are
and
i
agree
that
there's
a
difference,
nevertheless,
they
are
important
to
the
parties
and
they
have
some
relation.
now,
our
adversary
say,
in
the
reply
brief,
they
rather
minimize
the
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause
to
the
--
to
the
employer.
at
page
13
of
their
reply
brief,
they
said,
"no
one
pretends
that
a
no-strike
clause
guarantees
an
employer
against
strikes."
well,
i
don't
know
where
and
on
what
basis
they
make
that
point,
and
--
but
i
suggest
that
the
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause
of
the
employers
of
this
nation
may
be
found
in
the
statistics
given
us
by
a
very
--
a
writer
in
a
very
recent
note
in
the
new
york
university
law
journal,
38
nyu
at
page
1009,
were
he
says,
"absolute
no-strike
clauses
are
found
in
48%,
conditional
no-strike
clauses
in
46%
of
all
collective
bargaining
contracts."
but,
i
will
agree
that
maybe
the
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause,
which
is
the
employer's
guarantee
of
industrial
peace
during
the
period
of
agreement.
i
will
agree
maybe
its
importance
varies
from
industry
from
industry.
perhaps,
in
the
steel
industry,
for
instance,
it
isn't
--
it's
important
but
not
so
bad
as
a
strike,
but
as
merely
cessation
of
production
and
you
stop
sales
at
a
profit.
but,
in
an
industry
like
the
meat
packing
industry
where
you
have
perishable
cattle
out
in
the
yards,
3,000
or
4,000
of
them,
shrinking
in
the
sun
at
the
rate
of
4%
a
day,
the
guarantee
of
continued
prosuc
--
production
and
the
immunization
of
the
employer
from
even
quickie
strikes,
and
this
was
no
quickie
strike,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear.
it
begun
on
may
the
11th
and
they
filed
their
grievances
on
july
the
--
on
july
the
15th.
this
was
no
quickie
strike.
you
can
see
the
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause
to
an
employer
and
if
it's
going
to
turn
out
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
they're
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
can
i
put
it
from
the
general
and
then
specifically
our
case?
i
mean,
we're
talking
now
about
the
importance
of
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
arbitration.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
we
want
to
arbitrate
that.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
we
want
to
arbitrate
that.
they
--
they
refused
the
offer.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
we
--
we
offered
to
arbitrate
it
at
the
time.
there's
also
a
question
in
this
case,
not
raised
here,
of
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
--
timeliness.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
no.
stamoulis
either
was
walked
--
was
fired.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
maybe
i
don't
follow
you.
stamoulis
walked
--
the
first
employee
walked
off.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
the
--
the
company
offered
to
arbitrate
his
discharge.
i'm
sorry,
his
discharge.
they
offered
to
arbitrate
his
discharge.
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
but
the
others
--
that's
right.
but
then
the
--
the
191
walked
off.
the
employer
then
said,
“comeback
and
we'll
arbitrate
stamoulis'
case
as
a
grievance
but,
if
you
don't
comeback,
you're
finished,"
and
they
didn't
comeback.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
at
that
point,
the
employer
took
the
position
that,
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
contract
was
terminated
and
they
warned
them
that
they've
hired
replacements
and
they
began
to
do
that
and
they
broke
the
strike.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i'm
saying,
from
the
general
proposition,
if
it
turns
out
that
no-strike
clauses
can
--
an
arbitration
clause
can
be
used
by
the
union
in
two
ways
one,
when
they
have
a
legitimate
grievance
and
they
seek
arbitration,
fine.
on
the
other
hand,
they
have
a
weak
grievance,
they're
still
permitted
to
resort
to
the
test
of
their
economic
strength.
they
strike.
when
the
strike
fizzles
or
the
employer
proves
stronger
than
they
thought,
then
they
claim
--
then
they
assert
the
grievance.
they
want
to
arbitrate
the
discharge,
which
is
exactly
what
they
did
here
on
july
the
5th,
after
the
strike
was
finished
in
effect.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
achieving
its
objective.
they
wanted
to
arbitrate.
now,
that's
--
if
arbitration
is
going
to
mean
that
to
employers,
i
suggest
that
employers
will
be
reluctant
to
enter
into
that
type
of
agreement.
now,
if
that's
true,
i
don't
think
we
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
arbitrating
is
an
act
--
fine
remedy
but
if
it's
going
to
be
used
--
if
one
party
is
to
have
a
preferred
advantage
in
invoking
its
terms
when
it
sees
fit
and
ignoring
them
when
it
sees
fit,
the
other
party,
very
understandably,
is
going
to
be
reluctant
to
enter
into
those
agreements
and,
although
justice
goldberg
indicated
you
could
draft
a
clause
that
will
protect
you
and
maybe
you
could,
it
seems
to
me,
it
will
intensify
the
difficulty
and
the
bitterness
sometimes
of
collective
bargaining
negotiations.
it
doesn't
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
your
paraphrasing
of
it.
i
--
i
would
say
that,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
--
that
the
--
after
having
offered
to
arbitrate
and
being
refused
by
the
union
and
have
it
--
having
this
developed
into
a
strike
or
walkout,
if
you
would,
the
paralyzed
production
caused
the
employer
a
great
damage.
he
was
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
material
breach
had
occurred
and
i
think,
under
drake
bakery,
there
is
room
left
for
a
material
breach
that
can
be
determined
by
a
court
and
does
not
have
to
be
referred
to
an
arbitrator
who
has
no
special
expertise
in
that
field.
and,
we
think
that
this
is
such
a
case.
i
would
like
to,
just
at
the
end
here
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
the
--
and
the
circumstances
of
the
repudiation,
as
your
honor
referred
to
in
his
opinion
in
drake
bakeries
and,
here,
we
think
the
circumstances
of
the
repudiation,
the
length
and
duration
of
the
strike
justified
the
employer
in
doing
what
he
did
and
made
it
a
matter
that
a
court
could
determine
and
a
matter
that
did
not
have
to
wait
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
we
did.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it's
in
the
record
in
a
footnote
but
i
agree.
it's
beyond
the
record
as
such.
yes,
we
did
enjoin
it,
the
violence
--
we
didn't
enjoin
the
strike.
we
enjoined
mass
picketing
in
violence
of
a
strike
that
they
didn't
sanction
at
all.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
believe
not.
i
--
i
really
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
doubt
that
we
could've
enjoined
the
strike
itself.
i
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
under
iowa
law
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
must
confess
on
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
quite
sure
but
i
--
sort
of
against
my
instincts
to
say
that
you
could
enjoin
a
strike.
i
--
we
enjoined
the
excesses
of
the
strike
but,
i
confess,
my
local
colleague
here
says
that
federal
law
would
preempt
in
this
situation
and
we
could
not
have
enjoined
the
strike.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
it
was
an
interstate
commerce
situation
here.
well,
i
must
say,
i
don't
know
the
answer
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
don't
know
whether
we
could
have
enjoined
this
strike.
i
would
doubt
it
because
i
would've
think
the
careful
preparation
that
went
into
the
advice
management
got
below,
would've
led
them
to
find
out
that
they
could've
tried
to
enjoin
the
strike,
but
they
didn't.
they
didn't
get
an
injunction
against
mass
picketing
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
