started
to
say
there
was
a
rough
--
justice
potter

--
and
ready
distinction
between

but
the

could
you
--
justice

excuse
me.
could
you
have
enjoined
the

stewart
you
did?
justice

could
you
have
gotten
an

relying
on
the
collective

agreement?
justice

stewart
alright.
justice

by
its
terms,
applies

to
federal
courts.

potter
stewart
and
