what
question
do
you
raise
in
the
second
case,
is
it
balmer
which
we
dismissed
this
--
the
one
of
the
substantial
federal
question
that
is
not
in
here?

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
when
you
say
a
sham
hearing,
supposing
that
there
is
a
hearing
and
the
professor
goes
before
the
present
committee
and
he
says,
"i
don't
want
to
sign
this
oath
because
i
don't
believe
in
oaths.
that's
my
reason
for
not
signing
it."
what
would
happen?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
--
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
--
what
authorities
would
i
have
been
to
these
proceedings,
what
the
hearing
really
means
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
that
was
all
there
was,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
university
were
required
to
discharge
him
automatically
under
the
terms
of
the
statute?
justice

mr.

justice
john
m.

what
questions
are
being
presented
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
--
let
me
answer
my
question
--
ask
my
question
to
you.
what
question
was
being
presented
now
in
this
appeal
that
were
not
raised
in
the,
what
i
call,
the
second
nostrand
case
which
we
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
all?
that
--
is
that
the
only
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
it
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
substantive
constitutional
questions
which
are
tendering
here,
all
the
exceptions
that
you
indicated
as
to
non-tenure
employees
and
aliens
that
the
question
is
---
were
before
us
then
or
the
one
that
you
are
tendering
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
questions
that
you
put
to
this
court,
not
to
the
state
supreme
court,
the
questions
that
you
put
to
this
court
in
the
second
nostrand
case,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
which
we
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
