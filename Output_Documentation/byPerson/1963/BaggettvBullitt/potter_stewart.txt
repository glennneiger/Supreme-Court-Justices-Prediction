this
isn't
necessary
to
be
viewed
as
an
effort
by
the
state
of
washington
to
protect
the
united
states
against
subversion
but
rather,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
exercise
in
washington's
rights
to
establish
what
qualifications
it
may
want
to
establish
for
its
--
the
people
who
teaches
in
the
state
university.
and
if
he
wants
to
establish
that
we
don't
want
to
hire
anybody
who
has
a
graduate
degree
for
instance,
that
maybe
a
very
foolish
policy
in
your
opinion
or
in
mind
but
why
--
why
aren't
they
authorized
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
the
person
has
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
school
and
go
to
college
and
become
a
phd.
but
if
he
wants
to
work
in
a
--
in
a
university
where
the
state
says,
"we
don't
want
anybody
here
who
has
anything
beyond
the
bachelor's
degree,"
then,
do
you
think
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
work
there
nonetheless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
he
has
a
phd?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitution
would
be
one
of
the
institutions
of
united
states,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
do
you
suppose
that
it
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
include
the
state
liquor
stores,
washington
state
liquor
stores,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
private
corporations
out
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
institutions
of
marriage?
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
dissent,
isn't
that
one
of
our
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
how
you
get
that
because
of
--
of
course,
you
can
--
i
can
argue
it.
i
couldn't
understand
how
you
can
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
institutions
it
says
not
limited
to
institutions,
it
doesn't
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
which
i
should
assume
would
be
our
constitutional
traditions.
justice
potter
stewart
including
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
i
--
would
--
wouldn't
it
be
within
the
competence
of
a
state
to
want
to
have
and
were
therefore
require
its
students
to
teach,
since
these
are
schools
in
the
united
states
of
america,
to
teach
generally
within
the
broad
confines
of
our
culture
rather
than
to
teach
what
might
have
been
taught
in
the
jungle
in
africa,
some
about
the
tribal
organization
and
that
the
way
to
--
and
that
the
way
to
if
you're
sick,
you
go
a
witch
doctor
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
basic
framework
of
--
of
our
society
rather
than,
as
i
say,
some
tribal
society
in
--
in
the
jungles
of
africa.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
think
it
would
be
competent
to
a
state
to
say,
"well,
you
can
make
and
teach
all
you
want
about
the
way
other
societies
are
organized
but
if
you're
going
to
teach
here
in
the
university
of
washington
in
the
united
states
of
america,
we'd
rather
have
you
devoted,
primarily,
to
our
institutions
of
--
including
all
our
institutions
rather
than
devoted
to
a
tribal
organization
and
society
where
--
where
the
witch
doctor
is
the
answer
to
all
of
everybody's
problem."
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
the
law,
i
suppose,
is
the
law
that
permits
or
changes
in
repeals
and
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
reverence
for
that
process?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
ability
of
changing,
otherwise,
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wouldn't
--
if
you
get
to
look
at
that
phrase
literally
as
you
do
and
--
and
as
your
colleague
does,
nobody
could
qualify
because
nobody,
i
suppose,
no
--
no
rational
human
being
has
an
undivided
allegiance
for
his
--
for
his
country.
in
other
words,
no
matter
how
loyal
a
citizen
he
may
be,
he
also
has
an
allegiance
to
his
parents,
to
his
wife,
to
his
children,
to
his
friends,
to
his
church,
to
his
school,
to
his
clubs.
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
no
human
being
could
sign
that
oath
if
it's
to
be
taken
as
you
literally
have
construed
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
the
language
couldn't
rationally
be
construed
the
way
you
construe
it.
justice
potter
stewart
at
what
stage
is
this
oath
required
to
be
signed
as
you
understand
it?
before
a
person
is
employed
or
on
his
application
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
nobody
signed
yet.
you
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
all
present
members
of
the
faculty?
justice
potter
stewart
with
or
without
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
were
asked
to
sign?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
it's
a
one
shot
thing,
you
sign
it
once
under
the
provisions
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
annual
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
promissory
one.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
other
two
are
just
one
--
one
shot.
