what
do
you
mean
by
undivided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
read
that
as
requiring
that
a
man
does
not
belong
to
the
united
nations,
does
not
belong
to
something
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
you
believe
that
he
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
you
believe
that
their
oath
would
prohibit
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
undivided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
again
comes
under
the
word
"undivided".
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i'm
asking
about
it
is
because
i
don't
know
exactly
what
it
means
by
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
you
mean
that
you
--
you
construe
that
as
meaning
that
a
man
can't
like
something
else
if
he
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
paramount.
you
say
that
the
government
couldn't
require
paramount
allegiance
to
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
obey
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
a
valid
law,
do
you
say
that
because
a
man
thinks
it's
bad
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
has
a
right
to
try
to
break
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
did
anybody
else
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
pointing
out
seemingly
that
the
word
"support"
is
susceptible
of
a
number
of
meanings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
some
of
them
that
--
do
you
argue
that
the
state
can't
require
you
to
swear
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
one
meaning
of
the
word
"support"
as
you
say
it
--
see
it,
is
that
it
means
you
would
be
far
and
advocate
and
not
recommend
the
change
of
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
takes
away
that
freedom
and
then
you
say
that
because
you
think
"support"
means
that
in
this
sense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
--
does
any
of
your
argument,
i
have
listened
to
it,
i
don't
understand
it
though,
is
any
of
your
argument
based
on
the
idea
that
in
this
country,
a
man
is
not
required
to
obey
either
the
constitution
or
the
laws
if
he
doesn't
like
them
and
thinks
they
are
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rest
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
the
difficulty
with
your
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
the
difficulty
with
your
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
very
definitely
differ
with
him.
we
have
no
illusions
about
the
1931
oath.
that's
not
backed
up
by
the
sanction
of
perjury.
the
statute
he
just
cited
there
had
used
the
word
"oath"
but
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"promissory".
