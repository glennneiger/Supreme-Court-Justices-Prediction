i
don't
quite
get
your
basic
argument.
you
say
these
strikes
at
the
part
of
the
teaching
profession
and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
might
--
and
we
might
agree
with
you
that
--
but
isn't
up
to
a
state
to
--
to
prescribe
the
kind
of
qualifications
its
--
it
wants
for
its
teachers
as
teachers?
in
others
words,
if
a
state
were
benighted
enough
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
your
views
of
right
policy
or
mind
to
say
that,
"i
promise
if
i
take
a
job
in
this
university,
i
won't
take
no
more
graduate
courses."
is
--
isn't
that
up
to
a
state
to
do
--
to
prescribe
such
qualifications
as
that?

a

i
tell
him
to
do
a

a

way
and
the

thinks
it's
entirely
wrong
but
if
he
wants
to
work
as
my
mechanic,
that's
the
way
he's
got
to
do
the
job.

mr.
morris,
would
you
say
that
(inaudible)
an
example
of
the
fact
is
(inaudible)
right
or
wrong?
justice
william
j.

where
--
where
do
you
find
that?

(voice

justice
william

mr.
morris,
getting
back
to
promoting
institution,
i
notice
that
one
of
your
witnesses
at
197
testified,
"if
i
were
to
sign
the
oath,
i
would
feel
that
i
had
forced
--
declared
falsely
that
i
hold
a
number
of
important
beliefs
to
which,
in
fact,
i
do
not
strike."
for
example,
although
i
support
the
general
concept
of
the
law
as
part
of
our
social
system,
there
are
many
specific
laws
which
i
do
not
support
any
sense,
this
include
the
mccarran
act,
the
smith
act,
the
stricter
immigration
and
passport
laws,
the
landrum-griffin
act
and
other
labor
laws
and
most
legal
provisions
which
outlawed
gambling,
prostitution,
abortion,
contraception
and
the
use
of
certain
narcotics.
now,
is
it
your
view
that
if
he
signed
this
oath
and
taught
those
beliefs
to
washington
university
students,
he'd
risk
prosecution
for
having
falsely
stated
that
he
would,
by
a
precept
and
example,
promote
the
institutions
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
only
to
say
then
if
he
did
teach
them
that
he
would
--
that
his
reluctance
of
teaching
would
be
because
he
thought
that
they
did
promote,
not
respect
for
but
disrespect
for
the
institutions
of
the
united
states?

justice
william

you
say,
there
had
been
hearings
or
--
justice
william
j.

no.
justice
william

it
is
a
ruling

professors
aren't
entitled
to
this.
justice
william

but
in
fact,
nothing
like
that
has
just
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fuller,
may
i
ask,
i
was
wondering
if
i
correctly
sensed
this,
some
of
the
things
that
you've
been
saying,
an
argument
that
none
of
this
really
is
wide
yet
far
consideration
to
the
constitutional
questions
anyway.
are
you
suggesting
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
--
much
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
much
better
if
we
waited
an
actual
demand
and
the
refusal
by
someone
on
some
basis
either
at
the
hearing
or
otherwise
and
--
and
that
we
reach
this
after
your
courts
submits
to
them
an
application
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
telling
this,
i
--
i
think
i
heard
mr.
morris
said
at
the
outset
of
his
argument
that
you
differed
with
him
whether
--
if
one
made
a
mistake
just
to
--
just
business
of
institution,
he
might
be
prosecuted
criminally
if
he
signed
this
on
the
--
and
then
will
prosecute
--
will
be
prosecuted
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
what's
the
meaning
of
--
i
don't
know.
is
this
a
--
the
text
is
as
followed
that
says,
"teaching
faculty
oath"
and
that
--
what
--
if
this
is
it
as
we
reproduced
at
page
15
encloses
with,
i
understand
that
this
statement
in
oath
are
made
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
didn't
know
anything
about
1931
and
1955
and
i
were
a
faculty
member,
would
i
read
this
reasonably
as
meaning
of
that
last
sentence
but
if
i
were
wrong
about
something
i
said
as
to
the
first
paragraph,
i
might
be
prosecuted
for
perjury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
looks
to
me
or
i
must
suppose
the
vagueness,
the
very
form
of
the
oath
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
speaking
it
now
with
the
non-signee,
they
might
say
that
they
were
also
entitled
with
a
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
they
don't
take
--
those
folks
don't
take
the
first
paragraph
or
do
they?(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

justice
william

have
discretion?
