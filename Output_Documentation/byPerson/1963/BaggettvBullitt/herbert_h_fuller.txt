mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
distinguished
counsel.
it's
true
that
we
must
safeguard
our
constitutionally
guaranteed
liberties.
it
is
also
true
that
we
must
protect
ourselves
against
the
dangers
of
subversion.
now,
having
said
this,
we've
said
very
little
toward
assisting
the
court
in
determining
case
before
it
because
what
is
needed
is
not
generalities,
however,
true
these
generalities
maybe.
but
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
statutes,
a
consideration
of
the
context
out
of
which
they
overruled
and
an
understanding
of
the
statutes
and
how
they've
been
applied
and
interpreted
by
the
courts
in
our
state.
now,
the
course
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
deal
first
with
the
subversive
activities
act,
passed
in
1951
as
amended
in
1955
and
devote
the
latter
part
of
the
argument
to
the
1931
oath
requirement.
well,
i
don't
purport
to
go
into
detail
in
the
1951
act.
i
would
like
to
very
quickly
present
a
bird's
eye
view
of
what
it
requires.
as
the
court
knows,
the
washington
legislature
did
not
simply
shoot
an
arrow
into
the
blue
when
it
passed
the
subversive
activities
act
of
1951.
prior
to
this
act,
the
governor
of
the
state
had
requested
that
it
be
passed.
prior
to
the
governor's
request,
extensive
hearings
had
been
held
by
a
state
investigating
committee.
now,
when
the
act
was
finally
passed,
it
was
patterned
in
large
part
after
the
so-called
"ober
act"
in
the
state
of
maryland,
consisted
of
some
22
sections.
the
first
section
is,
perhaps,
the
most
important
in
the
entire
act,
it's
the
definitional
section.
and
in
a
few
minutes,
because
if
the
importance
of
this
section,
i
would
like
to
drawback
to
it.
the
next
three
sections
relate
to
criminal
sanctions
and
they
are
not
before
the
court.
the
following
five
sections
relate
to
the
appointment
of
a
special
assistant
attorney
general.
now,
these
are
not
before
the
court
because
four
out
the
five
have
been
vetoed
by
the
governor.
the
one
remaining
of
these
five
sections
merely
requires
that
the
attorney
general
report
biannually
to
the
legislature
on
subversive
affairs.
this
brings
us
then
to
section
11
which
is
one
of
the
key
sections
as
far
as
the
state
loyalty
program
is
concerned.
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
quote
directly
from
the
statutes
but
only
to
paraphrase
them.
section
11
lays
down
the
base
rule
that
no
subversive
person
shall
be
eligible
for
public
employment
in
the
state
of
washington.
section
12
establishes
an
administrative
program
which
places
a
certain
amount
of
power
in
the
hands
of
agency
officials
to
determine
whether
those
and
their
employee
are
subversive
persons
within
the
meaning
of
the
1951
act,
as
amended
--
later
as
amended.
now,
section
12
is
one
of
two
sections,
which
was
amended
by
the
1955
act.
section
13
provides
that
this
requirement
as
to
those
who
are
employed,
as
opposed
to
applicants,
shall
not
be
applicable
to
non-sensitive
areas
of
state
government.
now,
at
this
point,
i
should
advise
the
court
that
in
the
entire
state
of
washington,
i
know
of
not
one
area
which
has
been
declared
non-sensitive.
i
think
we
should
be
frank
about
that.
we
say
that
this
is
evidence
of
the
very
poor
level
of
enforcement
which
the
act
has
received.
section
14
requires
a,
what
we
will
call,
a
one-shoot
affidavit
requirement,
a
disclaimer
as
of
--
for
all
employees
who
are
employed
as
of
june
1,
1951.
in
section
15,
sets
up
a
rather
elaborate
hearing
procedure
for
those
who
have
been
accused
of
being
subversive
persons
under
the
act.
again,
i
should
be
frank
with
the
court
and
tell
the
court
that
i
know
of
not
one
instance
on
section
15
has
ever
been
employed.
the
next
section
requires
an
affidavit
from
a
candidate
for
election.
the
last
section
which
i
would
like
to
mention
is
section
19
of
the
act.
this
is
a
key
section
because
it
is
a
mandate.
as
we
see
it,
it
is
a
mandate
by
the
legislature
that
the
act
be
strictly
construed
with
an
idea
of
not
infringing
upon
a
person's
constitutionally
guaranteed
liberties.
this
section
is
very
short.
i'd
like
to
read
it.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
section
19,
page
82,
your
honor,
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
or
any
alternative
to
affirm.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
page
82,
your
honor,
section
19,
"nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
authorize,
require
or
establish
any
military
or
civilian
censorship
or
in
anyway
to
limit
or
infringe
upon
freedom
of
the
press
or
freedom
of
speech
or
assembly
within
the
meaning,
in
the
manner
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
washington
and
no
regulation
shall
be
promulgated
hereunder
having
that
effect."
as
it
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
by
this
litigation,
do
you
refer,
your
honor,
to
nostrand
against
little,
nostrand
against
balmer?
your
honor,
it
has
never
been
before
our
supreme
courtm,
except
for
that
litigation
to
which
you've
refer,
which
is
really
all
one
series
of
litigation.
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
again,
i
can
say,
being
frank
with
the
court,
that
in
the
entire
state
of
washington,
i
do
not
know
of
one
instance
when
an
individual
has
refused
to
sign
the
oath.
there
may
well
be
instances,
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
weren't,
but
i
know
of
no
instance.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no,
your
honor,
not
a
single
one
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
university
of
washington
has
been
protected
from
the
operation
of
the
1955
amendatory
act
which
requires
the
disclaimer
requirement
almost
from
the
time
that
the
act
came
into
force.
before
the
oaths
could
actually
be
distributed
and
--
and
--
in
other
words,
before
a
person
had
a
chance
to
make
an
operative
refusal,
there
was
an
injunction
and
there's
been
an
injunction
--
prohibiting
the
university
from
demanding
the
oath.
now,
there's
been
an
injunction
in
effect
from
that
time
until
the
present
day
or
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
prohibiting
the
university
of
washington
from
demanding
the
oath
required
by
the
1955
act.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
there's
been
an
injunction
by
the
--
first
by
the
--
by
the
state
supreme
court.
now,
after
the
case
was
sent
here,
remanded
back,
again
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
dismissed
for
one
of
the
substantial
federal
question,
there
was
no
injunction
for
a
short
time.
now,
during
that
short
time,
the
mechanics
were
started
to
demand
the
oath
of
the
--of
the
university
professors
and
the
other
employees
but
it
was
such
that
the
they
couldn't
demand
the
oath
until
october,
a
number
of
them
were
away
and
the
mechanics
were
such
that
it
would've
required
four
or
five
months
to
demand
that
the
oath
be
signed.
so
what
the
university
said
in
effect,
and
here
i'm
paraphrasing
it,
they
said,
"you
shall
sign
the
oath
by
october
1st,
demand
is
hereby
made
that
you
sign
the
oath
by
october
1st."
and
i
believe
it
was
june,
possibly
july,
but
i
believe
it
was
june,
injunction
was
issued
by
the
three-judge
court
stating
the
hand
of
the
university
from
demanding
that
they
sign
the
oath.
it's
true
there
are
many
statements
of
intentions
where
some
of
the
appellants,
in
this
case,
state
that
they
certainly
have
no
intention
of
signing
the
oath
but
there's
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
changing
their
mind.
there
has
been
no
refusal
on
which
a
hearing
could
be
predicated.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
that
was
nostrand
against
little.
the
first
case
was
nostrand
against
balmer.
mr.
balmer
passed
away
and
the
title
of
the
case
was
changed.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
second
time
that
it
came
before
this
court,
it
was
called
nostrand
against
little.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
at
that
time
a
number
of
issues
were
raised
in
the
--
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
that
case.
there
were
first
amendment
arguments,
there
were
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
arguments,
bill
of
attainder
arguments
and
i'm
not
sure
about
some
of
the
other
arguments.
but
they
were
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
substantially,
the
same
as
the
arguments
in
this
case.
there
maybe
some
others
which
is
religious
aspect,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
were
substantially
the
same
as
the
arguments
in
this
case.
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
university
of
washington
has
had
a
judicial
umbrella
in
the
form
of
an
injunction
virtually
from
the
time
that
the
1955
act
has
been
passed.
the
result
of
this
is
that
the
university
of
washington
provides
a
test
tube
example
on
how
a
state
agency
might
operate
under
the
1951
act
without
the
1955
act.
we
submit
that
the
level
of
enforcement
has
been
sufficiently
low.
that
checks
as
to
an
individual's
loyalty
have
been
sufficiently
desultory
to
justify
the
legislature.
in
passing
the
1955
act,
i'd
like
to
quote
a
couple
of
examples
to
that
effect.
turning
to
the
record,
i
would
like
to
quote
part
of
a
statement
by
professor
reed
who
is
one
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
on
page
200.
now,
professor
reed,
the
court
will
recall
was
a
visiting
professor
from
australia,
who
decided
to
burn
his
bridges
behind
him
and
teach
at
the
university
of
washington.
was
he
informed
of
the
oath
requirement
prior
to
his
coming
to
the
university
of
washington?
on
page
200,
before
the
bottom
of
the
page
he
says,
"when
i
accepted
this
visiting
appointment,
i
was
not
informed
that
an
oath
of
any
nature
might
be
required
to
me."
less
--
thus,
would
seem
to
be
a
mistake
on
page
201
about
three-quarters
of
the
way
down
the
page,
he
says,
"i
was
at
no
time
informed
that
an
oath
of
any
nature
might
be
required
at
me
as
a
condition
of
my
employment
by
the
university."
i
now
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
statement
by
professor
birnbaum
during
the
course
of
his
deposition.
the
court
will
recall
that
professor
birnbaum
was
a
member
of
the
personnel
committee
of
the
mathematics
department.
now,
a
duty
of
the
personnel
committee
is
to
--
is
to
recruit
new
members
for
that
particular
department.
what
sort
of
checks
do
we
have
as
far
as
loyalty
or
membership
in
a
subversive
organization?
well,
on
page
62
of
the
record,
in
response
to
counsel
--
question
from
counsel
as
to
the
activities
of
the
committee
and
more
particularly
professor
birnbaum's
rule,
counsel
for
professor
birnbaum
asked
the
following
question,
question,
almost
to
the
bottom
of
that
page,
"do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
any
instance
in
which
there
has
been
an
exploration
of
a
candidate's
loyalty
to
the
state
of
washington?
answer:
"no."
question:
"do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
any
instance
in
which
there
has
been
an
exploration
of
a
candidate's
loyalty
to
the
united
states
of
america?"
answer:
"i
don't
know
of
any
preliminary
exploration
of
that
kind."
question:
"were
you
directed
by
anyone
at
the
university
of
washington
to
apply
such
standard?"
answer:
"a
matter
of
clarification,
before
the
loyalty
oath
issue
or
after."
question:
"well,
have
you
been
directed
by
anyone
at
the
university
of
washington
at
anytime
to
apply
any
such
standard?"
answer:
"i've
not
been
expressly
asked,
no."
now
certainly
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
your
honor,
i
agree
that
a
--
an
alien
cannot
agree
to,
by
precept
and
example,
promote
undivided
allegiance
to
the
united
states
of
america
by
flag,
essentially
to
mean
united
states
of
america.
the
question
is
not
before
us
whether
if
any
university
or
state
was
so
foolish
as
to
not
allow
aliens
to
be
in
its
faculty.
the
--
we
say
that
there
has
been
no
time
at
which
an
alien
has
been
excluded
from
employment
because
he's
been
required
to
take
this
oath.
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
this
is
one
of
those
old
interpretations
and
nobody
can
find
the
source
of
it
but
the
oath
has
been
applied
in
such
a
way
and
interpreted
it
in
such
a
way
as
long
as
we
know,
perhaps,
from
the
time
it
was
first
passed
so
that
it
would
not
apply
to
aliens.
now,
it
is
true
that
a
similar
oath
is
requested
of
aliens.
but
in
the
similar
oath
as
the
record
will
show,
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
point
to
the
exact
page,
but
there's
an
example
by
professor
aldenderfer
in
which
professor
aldenderfer
in
a
memo
to
the
people
in
this
department
or
that
one
particular
alien
said,
"i
will
support
allegiance
--
undivided
allegiance
to
the
united
states
insofar
as
this
is
consistent
with
my
citizenship
blank
country,"
or
something
to
that
effect.
at
no
time
have
we
ever
asked
an
alien,
to
my
knowledge,
to
sign
an
oath
that
he
will
provide
undivided
loyalty
to
the
united
states.
it
is
not
done
now.
we
do
not
know
that
it
will
be
done
in
the
future."
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
is
without
power
or
authority
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
questions.
i
do
say
that
it
--
it
would
be
much
better
if
we
have
this
factual
bedrock
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
with
actual
hearing.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
there
were
an
actual
hearing,
if
they
were
an
actual,
there
were
actual
interpretations
of
the
particular
constitutional
provisions
set
forth
in
the
hearing,
there
was
an
actual
factual
bedrock
of
refusal
by
somebody,
i
would
say
that
the
posture
for
decision
by
this
court
would
be
much
better.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
not
sure
but
i
--
as
recall
in
numbers
three
or
four,
counsel
may
correct
me
on
this,
but
a
very
small
number
that
there
are
a
number
employed
by
the
university
of
washington
and
this
is
not
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
in
the
record
but
by
other
universities
of
the
state
as
well.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
do
not
think
we
are,
your
honor,
because
there
is
no
demand
that
they
take
the
oath.
there
has
never
been
a
demand
that
they
take
the
--
my
oath,
i'm
referring
to
the
--
to
the
1931
of
oaths.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
whole
difficulty
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
--
there's
a
lot
to
be
said
for
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
action.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think,
one
of
the
difficulties
where
this
entire
litigation
is
a
fact
that
because
of
very
declaratory
nature
of
the
case
as
the
decisions
of
the
washington
states
supreme
court
indicate
is
just
about
impossible
to
tell
the
difference
between
dicta
and
holding
of
the
case
because
it
doesn't
have
that
factual
bedrock.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
that's
correct.
we
do
have
an
oath
form
before
us.
now,
i
grant
you
that
this
court
does
have
the
--
the
power
and
the
authority
to
find
something
void
on
its
phase.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
state
high
court
should
be
permitted
in
an
actual
case
to
pass
upon
the
definitional
sections
when
there's
an
actual
case
before
it.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
1931
oath,
as
i'll
try
to
explain
in
a
few
minutes.
we
say
that
a
state
high
court
should
be
able
to
pass
on
those
definitional
sections.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
there
should
be
an
actual
refusal
by
some
individual
before
this
matter
is
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
you're
referring
to
the
1955
oath.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
with
regard
to
the
1931
oath,
a
form
is
prescribed
by
the
statute.
with
regard
to
the
1955
oath,
no
form
is
prescribed
by
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
page
15
of
the
record,
your
honor?
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
15,
page
15.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
that
is
correct.
however,
the
--
the
pretrial
order
must
be
read
as
a
whole
and
certain
portions
of
the
pretrial
order
explain
that
this
oath
is
not,
as
of
aliens,
in
this
exact
form.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
i'd
be
happy
to,
your
honor,
and
i
had
reserved
that
for
latter
part
of
my
argument
but
i
would
like
to
come
to
it
or
i
rather
come
to
it
right
now,
your
honor,
as
long
as
your
honor
has
mentioned
it.
let
me
say
first
of
all
that
i'm
the
first
to
admit
that
these
words
are
susceptible
of
different
interpretations.
i
think
that
the
word
"institutions"
is
particularly
susceptible
with
the
number
of
--
of
interpretations.
we
feel
--
let
me
start
with
the
word
"flag"
we
feel
that
word
"flag"
really
means
the
united
states
of
america.
after
all,
the
flag
is
nothing
but
a
cloth
--
piece
of
cloth
with
the
insignia
of
country
on
it.
as
far
as
institutions
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
flag
is
--
is
a
definite
term.
it's
one
way
the
legislature
had
of
referring
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
to
the
state
of
washington.
far
as
institution
is
concern,
we
feel
that
it
refers
to
that
which
has
been
instituted,
in
other
words,
the
foundation,
in
other
words,
our
basic
constitutional
republican
form
of
government.
that
is
our
interpretation
of
the
word
"institutions".
we
do
not
think
that
it
includes
everything
that
has
been
mentioned
by
counsel
and
by
some
members
of
the
court.
that
is
our
interpretation
of
the
word
"institution".
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
our
interpretation
has
been
made
known
to
those
assistants
who
work
for
the
university.i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
written
interpretation.
there
may
well
have
been
oral
opinions
from
time-to-time.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
no,
your
--
no,
your
honor.
that
is
something
that
has
existed
for
years
and
years.
now,
i
have
searched
the
files
and
i
found
no
communication
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
has
never
been
any.
after
all,
this
was
passed
in
1931.
i'm
only
saying
that
i
know
of
none.
all
we
can
say
is
as
long
as
we
know
or
as
far
as
we
know,
there
has
never
been
a
request
that
an
alien
signed
the
oath
and
the
statutory
form
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i'm
the
deputy
attorney
general
for
the
seattle
area.
now,
part
of
my
responsibility
in
the
seattle
area
is
with
the
university
of
washington.
however,
other
attorneys
are
assigned
more
particularly
to
the
university
to
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
represent
them.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
does
provide
legal
assistance
to
the
university
of
washington
and
to
the
other
state
universities.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
we
would
advice
them
as
i've
just
stated
and
part
of
our
advice
will
the
based
upon
the
long
practice.
we
think
that
our
court
would
give
considerable
weight
to
the
fact
that
for
a
third
of
a
century
as
far
as
we
know
it's
been
done
this
way.
now,
the
point
is
that
whether
it
were
right
or
wrong,
it's
not
the
important
thing.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
washington
state
supreme
court
is
not
passed
upon
it.
now,
it's
done
this
way,
our
office
would
advice
that
it
be
done
this
way
and
we
know
of
--
there
is
no
indication
that
it
will
be
done
in
another
way
in
the
future.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
yes.
i
wasn't
really
reading
anything.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
was
just
saying
what
my
views
aren't
are
and
my
views
are
that
the
institution
means
our
basic
republican
form
of
government.
now,
i
know
that
this
is
rubber
tied
things
susceptible
to
a
certain
amount
of
stretch
and
there
could
be
a
lot
of
questions,
does
that
include
the
secret
ballot?
i
would
answer
yes.
the
next
question
--
the
next
statement
could
be,
"well,
we
didn't
have
a
secret
form
of
ballot
when
america
became
a
country."
i
know
that
there
are
number
of
questions
that
can
be
asked
regarding
institutions.
but
i
say
that
is
our
--
its
a
little
like
due
process.
it's
our
basic
republican
form
of
government.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
now,
of
course
the
term
has
a
particular
connotation
that's
present.
and
it's
a
little
difficult
for
me
just,
all
at
once,
to
give
a
definition
of
the
term
"establishment"
but
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
pick
that
pick
that
definition.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
well,
it
maybe
the
leading
one
but
i
submit
there
are
number
of
other
definitions
of
the
word
"institutions".
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
difficulties
here
as
we
have
so
many
different
definitions
and
the
--
the
court
that
should
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
might
well
be,
your
honor.
but
we
submit
that
if
that
is
the
difficulty,
at
least,
our
state
high
court
should
have
the
first
opportunity
to
apply
a
statutory
of
laws
and
perhaps
make
at
least
definite.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
now,
the
problem
is
that
mechanical
difficulty
of
having
the
two
oaths
combined.
and
then
mechanically,
the
university
has
combined
the
1931
oath
with
the
1955
oath.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
it's
got
to
be
conceded
that
mechanically
the
way
the
oaths
are
mechanically
put
together,
that
a
person
may
get
the
wrong
idea
and
think
that
the
first
part
would
have
a
sanction
of
perjury.
we
submit
that
the
first
part
does
not
have
a
sanction
of
perjury.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
because,
your
honor,
the
first
part
of
the
oath,
i'm
talking
strictly
about
the
1931
oath,
is
promissory
in
form.
and
traditionally,
there's
no
case
in
our
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
i
admit,
but
traditionally,
promissory
oaths
absent
some
particular
statutory
mandate
have
not
been
held
to
be
the
basis
for
the
prosecution
for
perjury,
at
least
in
my
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
think
that
is
correct.
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is
--
there
is
no
sanction.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
criminal
sanction.
now
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
there
are
number
of
objections
with
regard
to
vagueness
in
the
oaths.
our
point
is
that
the
washington
high
court
should
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
upon
this
vagueness
point.
four
years
ago,
almost
to
the
day,
i
came
before
this
court
when
i
was
representing
the
state
of
washington
in
an
action,
nostrand
against
balmer,
it
recalled
nostrand
against
savelle,
stated
to
this
court
that
the
two
professors,
professors
nostrand
and
professor
savelle,
would
very
probably
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
which
they
could
explain
or
defend
their
refusal
to
take
the
oaths
required
by
the
1955
act.
now,
four
years
later,
i
come
before
this
court
and
i
say
that
as
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
state
of
washington
for
determination
of
that
very
question
and
when
the
case
was
argued
before
the
washington
court,
the
office
of
attorney
general
argued
that
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
washington
would
seem
to
allow
such
a
hearing
counsel
for
professors
nostrand
and
savelle
argued
that
the
statutes
would
allow
and
no
such
hearing.
now,
the
washington
court
held
that
the
professors
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
we,
very
strenuously,
disagree
that
it
will
be
a
sham
hearing.
we
say
at
the
very
least
try
us,
let
us
see.
we
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
would
not
sanction
a
sham
hearing.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
can't
guess
the
disposition
of
the
particular
committee.
i
don't
know
what
the
hearing
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
--
officer
would
decide
on
all
the
evidence.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
the
precise
question
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
i
don't
think
that
--
that
university
in
every
case
is
required
to
discharge
an
individual
if
he
refuses
to
sign
the
oath.
i
can't
answer
your
question
because
of
the
particular
factual
basis
of
it
but
let
me
take
another
example.
let
me
take
an
example
of
whether
an
individual
belong
to
the
communist
party,
say
several
years
ago.
and
the
individual
attempted
to
resign
from
the
communist
party
but
a
number
of
years
had
gone
by,
he
no
longer
had
contact
with
those
individuals
that
he
had
once
known,
he
did
write
a
letter
to
somebody
and
yet
he
wasn't
sure
whether
he
could
sign
the
oath
or
not.
we
say
that
such
an
individual
came
forward,
demanded
a
hearing
and
at
this
hearing,
stated
that
he
had
written
a
letter
to
the
last
person
he
knew,
he
did
knew
whether
he
was
still
mailed
back
his
membership
card.
he
didn't
know
whether
he
was
still
carried
on
the
membership
rules.
we
say
that
if
such
a
person
would
kept
for
employment
that
it
might
well
be
affirmed
by
the
washington
state
supreme
court
that
ever
came
before
it.
we
say,
in
other
words,
that
would
not
be
a
sham
hearing.
it
would
be
a
hearing
with
a
very
real
meaning.
now,
there
are
two
other
categories.
not
only
those
of
academic
tenure
but
those
with
civil
service
tenure
and
those
who,
for
one
reason
or
another,
have
no
tenure
at
all.
the
real
significance
of
the
court's
decision
in
nostrand
against
little,
the
real
significance
was
the
fact
that
the
washington
court
held
that
they
could
not
interpret
the
1955
act
without
reference
to
any
other
act.
they
took
the
1955
act
on
the
hand
and
interpret
it
along
side
of
the
act
which
gave
the
board
of
regent
certain
powers.
they
read
them
together
and
came
out
with
the
hearing
requirement.
we
say
if
the
court
did
this
with
that
particular
statute,
they
might
well
compare
it
with
another
statute
such
as
the
civil
service
statute
passed
in
1951
or
the
administrative
procedures
act
passed
in
1959.
they
compared
it
with
one
statute.
they
might
well
compare
it
with
another.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
let
me
take
them
one
at
a
time,
your
honor.
let
me
take
first
of
all,
those
who
are
not
teachers
at
all,
those
who
are
non-academic
personnel
and
who
would
be
covered
by,
let
us
assume,
this
classified
service
of
the
state
civil
service
act,
section
5
--
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
h.
fuller
that
is
correct.
they
would
only
--
the
non-academic
personnel
would
only
take
the
1955
or
if
not,
the
1951
oath.
the
section
5
of
the
state
civil
service
act
authorize
the
various
institutions
of
higher
learning
to
set
up
the
personnel
committee.
this
was
done
at
the
university
of
washington.
the
personnel
committee
met
and
it
passed
rule
--
rule
14,
which
actually
adapted
rules
and
procedure
which
are
set
forth
in
the
civil
service
act,
so
this
would
prepare
the
hearing
for
those.
now,
the
key
question
is,
what
about
those
individuals
that
have
neither
civil
service
tenure
nor
academic
tenure,
would
they
be
afforded
a
hearing?
now,
the
going
gets
rough.
we
say
that
they
would
be
by
virtue
of
the
state
administrative
procedures
act
passed
in
1959.
state
administrative
procedures
act,
in
section
9,
provides
that
in
any
contested
case,
all
parties
shall
be
afforded
an
opportunity
for
hearing
after
reasonable
notice.
now,
what
did
they
mean
by
contested
case?
well,
section
1
defines
a
contested
case
as
a
proceeding
before
an
agency
in
which
the
legal
rights,
duties
or
privileges
of
specific
parties
are
required
by
law
or
constitutional
right
to
be
determined
after
an
agency
hearing.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing?
we
don't
know.
we
say
it
would
be
better
to
err
on
the
side
of
allowing
too
much
due
process
rather
than
allowing
too
little
due
process.
we
propose
to
grant
them
a
hearing
and
i
don't
know
who
can
raise
the
question
of
a
hearing
would
be
improper.
i'd
like
to
add
that
the
office
of
attorney
general
is
very
much
aware
of
the
serious
nature
to
an
individual
who
has
been
discharged
on
security
reasons.
i
don't
know
that
this
has
ever
been
done
but
we
recognized
that
it
is
serious.
for
that
reason,
along
with
the
mandate
contained
in
section
19
of
the
act,
we
propose
to
construe
the
definitional
sections
very
strictly.
we
propose
whenever
there
is
a
doubt
or
a
question
to
allow
a
person
a
hearing
and
a
fair
hearing.
we
cannot
meet
the
objections
to
those
who
feel
that
the
loyalty
act
such
as
this
is
unwise.
we
can
meet
the
objections
of
those
who
claim
that
there
is
a
procedural
deprivation.
we
can
meet
the
objections
of
those
who
claim
that
we
are
interpreting
the
act
in
too
broader
fashion.
next,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
those
definitional
sections
very
briefly.
but
before
i
do,
i've
already
discussed
the
1951
act.
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
in
1953,
the
washington
legislature
amended
the
definition
of
subversive
person
to
make
the
element
of
scienter
even
more
explicit.
in
1955,
we
say
because
it
may
be
had
been
dissatisfied
with
the
level
of
enforcement,
the
washington
legislature
amended
the
act
in
two
places
and
added
two
new
sections.
section
12,
if
the
court
will
recall,
set
up
an
administrative
program.
as
the
court
knows,
the
first
section
of
the
1955
act
added
to
disclaimer
requirement
that
a
person
must
disclaim
his
present
membership.
i
emphasized
the
word
"present
membership"
in
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization.
the
second
section
brought
us
into
conformity
with
the
non-sensitive
provision
which
was
section
13
of
the
original
act.
now,
the
third
section
was
a
very
harsh
section.
it
required
that
those
organizations
which
were
on
the
united
states
attorney
general's
list
be
deemed
subversive
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
the
washington
act.
i
hasten
to
add
that
this
section
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
washington
states
supreme
court.
the
last
section
simply
states
that
communist
party
is
declared
to
be
a
subversive
organization
and
membership
is
a
subversive
activity
thereunder.
as
far
as
the
oath
form
itself
is
concerned,
i've
already
stated
in
response
to
a
question
that
the
oath,
so
far
as
the
1955
portion
of
the
oath
is
concerned,
is
made
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
it
is,
by
and
large,
followed
by
state
agencies
even
though
there
is
no
absolute
requirement
that
they
do
so.
a
city
or
a
county
may
choose
to
follow
the
--
an
oath
of
their
own
choosing.
we
have
supplied
them
with
an
oath
and
i
can
say
that
by
and
large,
they
have
adapted
our
oath
form.
now,
an
examination
of
the
oath
itself
shows
that
not
all
of
the
oaths
comes
from
the
1955
act
because
the
mandatory
portion
of
the
1955
act
only
requires
that
a
person
state
whether
he
is
a
member
of
a
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization
while,
in
fact,
more
is
asked
in
the
oath.
a
person
is
asked,
for
example,
whether
he
is
a
subversive
person.
this
stems
from
the
1951
act.
i'll
also
hasten
to
add
that
this
is
a
request
for
information.
this
is
not
a
--
a
particular
requirement
of
future
behavior.
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
request
this
information.
it
is
true
that
under
section
12
of
the
1951
act,
the
state
may,
in
the
future,
request
more
information.
now,
i
come
to
the
key
part
of
the
1951
act,
which
are
the
definitional
sections.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
is
apparent
when
we
consider
the
definitional
sections
is
the
fact
that
each
definition
must
perform
a
double
duty.
on
the
one
hand,
it
defines
a
subversive
organization,
membership
of
which
maybe
a
crime.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
defines
a
subversive
organization
membership
in
which
it
cause
one
to
lose
his
public
employment.
now,
of
course,
it's
actually
a
mandate
that
criminal
statutes
are
strictly
construed,
although
the
criminal
portions
of
the
statutes
are
not
before
the
court.
we
say
that
these
strict
constructions,
since
there's
only
one
definition
of
subversive
organization,
since
there's
only
one
definition
of
subversive
person,
since
there's
only
one
definition
of
foreign
subversive
organization,
we
say
that
this
strict
criminal
construction
benefits
those
who
come
under
the
loyalty
portion
of
the
act.
the
strict
construction
is,
of
course,
buttress
by
section
19
which
i
read
to
the
court
earlier,
the
mandate
by
the
legislature
that
the
act
be
strictly
construed.
what
is
a
subversive
organization
under
the
act?
we
did
not
claim
if
these
terms
are
self-defining,
since
they
are
defined
in
the
act.
this
is
one
of
the
difficult
areas
of
this
case
but
i
think
that
it
is
better
to
discuss
it.
i
will
paraphrase
the
definition
of
"subversive
organization"
rather
than
read
the
expressed
statutory
definition.
subversive
organization
is
any
organization,
purpose
of
which
is
to,
to
do
what?
to
engage
in
a
type
of
activities
or
to
advocate,
abet
or
advise
a
type
of
activities.
what
type
of
activities?
activities
intended
to
assist
in
the
overthrow,
distraction
or
alteration.
alteration
of
what?
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
united
states,
of
the
state
of
washington
or
of
any
political
subdivision
of
either
of
them.
now,
the
definition
of
subversive
person
is
a
little
more
involved.
who's
a
subversive
person?
according
to
the
statute,
any
person
who
aids
in
the
commission
or
advocates,
abets,
advises
or
teaches
by
any
means,
any
person
to
aid
in
the
commission.
commission
of
what?
any
act
intended
to
assist
in
the
overthrow,
distraction
or
alteration.
answer
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
washington
or
any
political
subdivision
or
either
of
them.
how?
by
revolution,
force
or
violence.
in
addition,
according
to
our
statute,
one
is
defined
for
purposes
of
the
act
as
a
subversive
person
who
with
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
an
organization
as
defined
on
the
section
relating
to
foreign
subversive
organization,
as
relating
to
a
subversive
organization
becomes
or
remains
a
member
of
such
an
organization.
perhaps
the
most
controversial
is
the
definition
of
"foreign
subversive
organization".
this
is
quite
similar
to
subversive
organization
except
that
it's
further
defined
as
an
organization
directed,
dominated
or
controlled
directly
or
indirectly
by
a
foreign
government.
further,
although
the
section
does
speak
in
terms
of
overthrow,
distraction
or
alteration,
we've
got
to
face
the
fact
that
it
does
not
have
the
qualifying
words
by
revolution,
force
or
violence.
now,
we
interpret
this
to,
nevertheless,
mean
by
revolution,
force
or
violence.
and
by
revolution,
we're
not
talking
about
a
peaceful
revolution
such
as
the
industrial
revolution.
we
understand
revolution
to
be
a
popular
armed
insurrection
in
the
sense
in
which
it's
popularly
used.
where
do
we
base
this
on?
we
based
it
on
the
fact
that,
on
the
one
hand,
it
is
a
foreign
organization.
in
other
words,
being
a
foreign
organization,
it
maybe
less
likely
to
rely
upon
normal
democratic
processes.
it
may
be
more
likely
to
rely
upon
an
army
which
maybe
the
fist
or
the
spirit
of
the
foreign
organization.
when
the
foreign
niche
of
the
organization
and
the
fact
that
it
may
be
relying
upon
a
foreign
army
is
combined
with
the
words
"overthrow,
distraction
or
alteration",
we
feel
that
it
is
clear
enough
that
this
means
by
revolution,
force
or
violence.
now,
this
court
has
often
held
that
if
will
uphold
the
statute
if
it
can
be
given
a
constitutional
construction.
this
portion
was
given
a
constitutional
construction,
we
submit,
by
the
state
of
maryland
with
the
ober
act,
which
as
far
as
the
definitional
provisions
are
concerned,
are
identical
to
those
in
this
case.
in
the
case
of
shub
against
simpson,
maryland
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
referring
to
the
ober
act,
was
to
prevent
infiltration
in
our
state,
referring
to
the
state
of
maryland,
county
or
municipal
government
by
persons
who
are
engaged
in
one
way
or
another,
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
now,
when
the
gerende
case
came
before
this
court,
attorney
general
hammond,
i
believe
it
was,
gave
the
act
such
an
interpretation
and
seem
to
require
change
by
violent
means.
we
say
if
it
was
done
in
the
state
of
maryland,
it
could
be
done
on
the
state
of
washington.
again,
our
interpretation
is
buttressed
by
section
19
of
the
act
asking
that
it
be
given
a
constitutional
interpretation.
now,
my
final
point
is
this,
with
regard
to
the
1931
act,
it
maybe
true
that
as
the
(inaudible)
said,
most
questions
eventually
come
before
this
court.
this
is
also
applicable
to
the
1955
act.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
legal
questions
are
involved,
we
submit
that
the
real
questions
involved
are
not
so
much
constitutional
questions
as
there
are
questions
of
wisdom.
and
we
say
that
the
solution
for
the
appellants
is
with
the
washington
state
legislature,
just
as
a
solution
for
those
who've
just
like
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
was
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
we
say
that
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
washington
is
the
proper
area
in
which
the
appellants
should
seek
their
remedy.
thank
you.
