may
it
please

mr.

sorry.

mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
court.
this
case,
baggett
against
bullitt,
number
220,
is
a
loyalty
oath
case
involving
test
oaths
as
a
condition
of
academic
employment
at
a
state
university
in
united
states,
the
university
of
washington.
this
case
presents
many
issues
but
one
of
them
which
is
of
paramount
significance
and
one
to
which
i
wish
to
attract
my
attention
and
one
to
which
i
shall
confine
the
bulk
of
my
argument
is
whether
or
not
these
test
oaths
function
as
a
prior
restraint
on
academic
freedom
,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
association
and
freedom
of
conscience.
specifically,
does
the
state
have
constitutional
power
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
require
that
all
professors
give
up
certain
of
their
rights
for
academic
freedom,
free
speech,
association
and
conscience
as
a
condition
of
academic
employment
at
a
state
university?
the
facts
of
the
case
can
easily
be
stated.
as
to
the
class
action
brought
by
64
people
who
are
intimately
connected
with
the
university
of
washington,
64
of
the
--
of
the
64
appellants,
56
of
them
are
professors
and
members
of
the
academic
faculty
having
teaching
and/or
research
duties.
this
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
pages
151
to
156.
thirty-one
of
the
professors
have
tenure
at
the
university
of
washington
and
25
of
the
professors
have
academic
appointments
usually
for
a
three-year
duration.
now,
these
25
professors
do
not
have
tenure
but
they
are
not
probationary
employees
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
but
instead
they
have
a
three-year
appointment
that
is
renewable
for
another
three
years
at
the
end
of
which
they
will
acquire
tenure
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
294.
many
of
the
professors
have
security
clearances
from
such
agencies
of
the
united
states
atomic
energy
commission,
the
united
states
air
force,
the
navy
and
the
boeing
company.
of
the
eight
remaining
appellants
who
are
not
members
of
the
academic
faculty,
four
of
them
are
students
of
the
university
of
washington,
two
are
secretary
typists,
one
is
a
micro-meteorologist
and
another
is
an
assistant
editor
of
the
university
of
washington
press.
many
of
the
professors
at
the
university
of
washington,
three
of
whom
are
before
this
court
today,
professor
usinger,
professor
kenneth
reed
and
professor
paul
didrickson
are
aliens.
as
set
forth
at
page
102
of
appellants'
briefs,
these
oaths
have
been
demanded
of
the
aliens
who
were
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
say
as
set
forth
at
page
102
of
the
appellants'
brief,
the
aliens
have
been
demanded
that
they
execute
the
oaths
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that's
also
supported
by
the
record
at
pages
159,
page
303
and
page
176.
the
context
within
which
the
professors
assert
their
rights
is,
of
course,
the
university
of
washington.
it
was
--
it
was
early
founded
in
our
nation
in
1861.
it
is
now
in
its
2nd
century
of
academic
endeavor.
it
is
older
than
the
state
of
washington
having
been
found
prior
to
that.
at
the
present
time
on
its
seattle
campus,
it
has
the
faculty
of
over
1500
professors,
a
physical
plan
of
about
100
permanent
buildings
located
in
area
of
about
600
acres.
beyond
its
seattle
campus,
it
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
they're
--
the
educational
research
activities
of
university
of
washington
are
fully
described
in
the
record
on
pages
89
to
150.
i
should
only
point
out
that
the
size
of
the
university,
although
it
has
a
total
of
32,000
students
that
the
size
alone
is
not
a
measure
of
its
quality
but
rather
the
measure
of
its
quality
tends
to
be
in
the
quality
of
its
graduate
students,
the
quality
of
its
professorial
staff
and,
of
course,
in
the
physical
plant.
it
is
the
14th
largest
at
the
present
time.
it
is
one
of
the
three
on
the
west
coast
that
happened
to
be
members
of
the
american
association
universities
and
only
40
universities
in
the
nation
can
claim
this
membership.
before
turning
directly
to
the
materials
with
respect
to
prior
restraint,
i
should
like
to
clarify
two
points,
one,
raised
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
reply
to
our
brief,
namely,
that
the
definitional
sections
of
this
oath
are
not
an
issue.
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
160
of
the
record.
the
attorney
general's
brief
at
page
26
argues
that
the
definitional
sections
of
the
oath
are
not
before
this
court.
in
fact
and
i
quote,
he
says,
"one
search
is
the
pleadings
and
pretrial
order
in
vying
for
a
clear
request
that
the
definitional
sections
be
declared
unconstitutional."
now,
agreed
fact
12
on
page
160
states,
"the
other
statutes
material
to
this
cause
and
whose
constitutionality
are
contested
here
require
the
oath."
these
statutes
are
here
and
after
referred
to
as
requiring
the
1955
oath
and
it
was
agreed
that
this
would
be
a
shorthand
way
of
expressing
what
follows.
and
our
part
of
the
subversive
activities
act
of
the
state
of
washington
being
chapter
377,
laws
of
1955,
amending
chapter
254,
laws
of
1951.
and
then
following,
as
reproduced
there,
a
--
the
definitional
sections
so
that
it
appears
very
clearly
at
agreed
fact
12
that
the
definitional
sections
are
before
this
court
and
this
court
will
not
search
in
vain
in
order
to
find
a
request.
also,
this
was
supported
by
paragraph
(66)
of
the
complaint
as
that
paragraph
is
buttressed
by
the
appendix
b
of
the
--
appended
to
the
complaint
found
on
page
15
and
also
as
buttressed
by
page
165
of
the
record
and
the
district
court
opinion
on
page
239
where
the
district
court
says
that
these
statutes
are
in
issue.
the
second
point
i
should
like
to
make
is
the
general
one
with
respect
to
be
these
oaths
and
that
is
that
these
oaths
are
current
and
prospective.
at
page
245
of
the
record,
there
is
a
paragraph
from
the
district
court's
opinion.
i
shall
quote
it,
"these
plaintiffs
here
are
simply
required
to
state
that
they
do
not
now
and
will
not,
in
the
future,
engaged
in
the
proscribe
subversive
conduct
nor
become
a
remaining
members
of
a
subversive
organization
as
defined
in
the
statute."
that
means
that
a
professor
then
must
swear
that
he
now
and
for
the
future,
he
will
restrict
his
activities
to
what's
required
by
the
statute.
and
that
which
is
required
by
the
statute
strikes
directly
at
the
teaching
functions
strikes
to
the
heart
of
the
classroom
because
these
also
are
not
a
search
for
data,
they
are
not
a
request
by
the
legislator
--
pardon
me,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
asking
the
professors
whether
or
not
they
might
be
members
of
the
subversive
organizations,
but
what
these
oaths
do
in
fact
is
to
require
that
each
professors
give
the
right
answer,
only
one
answer,
namely,
that
they
are
not
members
of
a
subversive
organization
or
they
are
not
a
subversive
person.
and
then
and
then
only
will
they
qualify
for
the
possibility
of
hiring
so
long
as
they
are
further
substantively
qualified
in
their
disciplines.
so
that
the
point
i
should
like
to
make
here
is
that
distinguishing
all
of
the
congressional
investigation
cases,
the
committee
cases
and
the
state
committee
investigation
cases,
these
statutes
do
not
present
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
may
search
for
data
and
it's
not
before
the
court
and
our
position
is,
of
course,
the
state
has
large
powers,
strong
powers
to
search
for
data
in
a
committee
inquiry.
what
these
statutes
do
is
to
strike
at
the
very
heart
of
the
teaching
function.
now,
if
i
may
direct
to
the
court's
attention
at
page
15
of
the
record,
i
should
point
out
what
it
is
that
was
circulated
to
the
members
of
the
faculty
at
the
university
of
washington,
that
is
the
oath
in
question
here,
oath
form
a.
there
are
basically
two
oaths,
one
is
the
1931
oath,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
first
paragraph,
and
the
other
one
is
the
disclaimer
oath
in
the
second
paragraph.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
page
15,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
we
do
not
object
to
taking
an
oath
that
the
professors
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
repeatedly
some
professors
have
hyphenated
that
answer
--
and
specifically
included
the
bill
of
rights.
there
is
no
objection
there.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
the
first
oath
requires
that
a
professor
by
precept
and
example
will
do
certain
things,
that
is
by
doctrine,
by
his
speech,
by
his
classroom
lectures.
and
this
was
--
this
oath
applies
only
to
teachers.
it
does
not
apply
to
any
other
state
employee.
it's
aimed
right
up
the
teaching
function.
it
says
that,
"i
will
by
precept
and
example
promote
respect
to
the
flag,
the
institutions
of
the
united
states
of
america,
state
of
washington,
reverence
for
law
and
order,
and
undivided
allegiance
to
the
government
of
the
united
states."
mr.
arval
a.
morris
specifically,
it
requires
that
a
professor
must
teach
certain
things
irrespective
of
the
truth
of
those
things.
well,
as
set
forth
on
page
195
of
the
record,
professor
stull
holt
who
is
a
professor
of
american
foreign
policy,
requires
--
states
that
this
requires
that
he
must
teach
certain
probable
untruth
with
respect
to
united
states
conduct
in
the
mexican
war
and
with
respect
to
the
united
states
conduct
in
acquiring
the
danish
west
indies
and
with
respect
to
united
states
conduct
on
the
occasion
of
the
revolution
in
hawaii
in
1893.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
perhaps
i
can
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor.
underlying
that
notion
is
the
idea
of
an
employer-employee
relationship,
the
master-servant
relationship,
that
the
master
hires
a
servant,
the
servant
shall
do
exactly
what
the
master
says.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
i
believe
it's
undeniable
that
the
claims
of
academic
freedom,
which
are
recognized
by
this
court
in
sweezy,
run
counter
the
usual
prerogatives
of
an
employer
in
the
master-servant
relationship.
outstanding
example
of
that
is
that
this
court
is
hired
by
the
united
states
by
--
by
congress
in
that
sense.
congress
doesn't
direct
this
court
how
to
decide
a
case.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
--
to
you
that
the
freedom
of
universities
is
just
as
important
as
the
freedom
of
judges.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
there
is
--
not
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
the
usual
master-servant
relationship
here.
in
fact
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no.
the
analogy
doesn't
hold
to
the
--
this
court
but
it
would
certainly
hold
to
certain
courts
of
inferior
status
than
this
court
that
is
to
the
district
courts.
and
congress
might
very
well
argue
that
it
had
that
power.
the
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
claims
of
academic
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
we
do
say
that.
we
say
that
in
essence.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
what
it
--
what
this
oath
requires
is
that
by
precept
and
example,
the
teacher
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
shall
teach
undivided
allegiance
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
we
do.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
because
we
don't
believe
that,
first
of
all,
that
any
state
agency
has
power
to
promote
undivided
allegiance
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
when
many
appellants
in
this
case,
professors
are
members
of
religious
orders
who
believe
that
their
undivided
allegiance
belong
to
god,
other
members
believe
that
their
undivided
allegiance
belongs
to
united
nations,
other
members
of
the
faculty
believe
their
undivided
allegiance
belong
to
mankind
generally
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
any
state
that
power.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
allegiance
to
no
one
other
than
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
we
believe
that
he
can.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
belong
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
if
he
were
to
promote
by
example
and
undivided
allegiance
to
an
agency
other
than
united
states
government
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
pardon
me.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
yes,
it
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
the
undivided
allegiance
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no.
that
--
that's
not
our
argument.
our
argument
is
that
the
allegiance
that
is
undivided
means
the
paramount
allegiance,
the
whole
allegiance.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
else
why
with
the
state
of
washington
enact
this
measure.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
it
would
seem
that
that
would
be
stricken
at
least
by
pennsylvania
against
nelson
where
this
court
held
that
a
state
did
not
have
power
to
protect
the
united
states
government
from
subversion.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
seeking
to
promote
under
by
allegiance
the
united
states
government.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
in
fact,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
history
of
this
country
sometimes
could
easily
be
construed
as
teaching
disrespect
to
the
flag,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
well,
the
basic
point
here
is
that
not
only
is
the
congressional
policy
at
stake
with
respect
to
fostering
cultural
exchanges
because
aliens
have
assigned
their
selves.
so
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
congressional
policy
is
at
stake.
and
so
that
the
basic
factors
behind
pennsylvania
against
nelson
would
be
offered
to
them.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no.
he
was
convicted
felon.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
i
would
agree
that
the
state
of
washington
has
a
wide
latitude
to
--
in
its
hiring
policy.
however,
it
cannot
condition
its
policy
on
the
basis
of
unconstitutional
factors
and
unconstitutional
condition.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
think
you
put
the
clear
case.
but
suppose
they
said,
"you
cannot
work
here
because
you're
a
catholic."
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
know
of
no
occasion
which
the
nineteenth
amendment
been
incorporated.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
if
this
court
were
to
incorporate
the
nineteenth
amendment
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states,
there
might
be
an
argument
but
that's
a
very
far
appeal
decision.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
maybe
i
would
think
that
the
--
the
state
power
would
maybe
question
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
then
it
have
to
find
some
rational
basis
for
that
classification
in
relation
to
the
teaching
function
and
i'm
not
really
sure
if
there
is
one.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
mr.
--
professor
gordon
orians
and
professor
william
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
we
argue
that
the
member
of
the
quaker
faith,
for
example,
cannot
sign
this.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
your
honor.
tyhis
case
--
this
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
there
has
been
none
before
our
supreme
court.
the
1931
oath,
which
is
the
first
paragraph,
has
not
been
construed
by
the
state
supreme
court
state
of
washington.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that
is
--
that
is
not
true.
the
district
court
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
the
district
court
dismissed
with
prejudice
having
passed
on
part
of
the
1931
oath.
i
can
direct
this
court's
attention
to
where
the
district
court
passed
on
part
of
the
1931
oath,
page
252.
the
district
court
opinion
is
divided
first
of
all
dealing
with
the
disclaimer
oath
and
then
dealing
with
the
oath
of
allegiance
statute.
the
last
paragraph
that
runs
over
from
page
252
to
253
says,
"insofar
as
the
arguments
heretofore
considered,
with
respect
to
the
loyalty
oath,
are
advanced
also
in
connection
with
the
attack
on
the
validity
of
the
oath
of
allegiance
statute,
the
preceding
discussion
of
the
points
raised
is
applicable."
it
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
the
attorney
general
has
argued
to
the
contrary
but
the
statutes,
the
perjury
statutes
of
the
state
of
washington
are
clear.
revise
code
od
washington
5.28.060
states,
"a
false
affirmation
of
an
oath
is
to
be
deemed
perjury
equally
with
the
false
oath."
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
this
court
has
not
enlightened
as
to
the
exact
definition
of
the
term
"institutions".
there
are
other
words,
however,
that
we
believe
are
quite
clear.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
i
would
assume
that
since
the
first
part
of
the
oath
deals
with
a
promotion
by
precept
and
example
--
pardon
me,
the
first
part
of
the
oath
requires
that
the
person
will
support
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
i
would
assume
that
the
institutions
are
not
the
legal
institutions
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
i
should
think
that
the
first
part
of
the
oath
would
already
take
care
of
that
and
that
when
construing
the
term
"institutions"
that
it
would
not
necessarily
include
legal
institutions
because
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
seemed
to
be
first
in
that
oath,
a
remainder
part
would
come
in
underneath
the
term
"institution".
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
i
should
imagine
it
means
the
american
way
of
life.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
it
does
and
it
may
very
well
include
that
as
an
institution.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
should
imagine
that
this
could
be
all
encompassing.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
may
--
it
may
well
include
marriage,
it
may
well
include
--
to
the
extent
that
we're
talking
about
the
institutions
in
the
united
states,
de
facto
segregation
in
the
north
and
not
so
de
facto
segregation
in
the
south.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
would
appear
that
the
purpose
of
this
oath
is
to
require
a
conformity
rather
than
the
right
to
dissent.
if
they
--
the
right
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well
when
someone
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
it's
limited
to
the
institutions
of
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
the
traditional
aspects,
i
would
imagine.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
should
hope
so
but
we
don't
really
know
that.
the
purpose
in
enacting
this
oath,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
promote
a
conformity
of
opinion,
a
--
an
assuredness
that
professors
who
are
lecturing
before
classes
will
have
a
particular
point
of
view
else
why
requiring.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
absolutely
forbidden
to
the
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
would
agree
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
prescribe
the
substantive
content
of
the
curriculum.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
should
think
that
to
an
anthropologist
and
teaching
anthropology
at
the
university
of
washington,
as
professor
valentine
does
at
page
198
in
the
record,
that
the
institutions
of
the
africans
are
quite
relevant
and
they
may
very
well
be
relevant
to
his
discipline.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
believe
the
first
amendment
goes
far
enough
to
enable
a
man
to
have
the
right
to
teach
that
the
institutions
to
this
country
are
wrong.
and
i
should
imagine
that
a
professor
would
have
the
right
underneath
the
first
amendment
to
teach
that
the
institutions
in
this
country
are
wrong
and
that
they
should
not
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
again,
we
come
back
to
the
employment
relationship
underlying
the
state's
case
as
the
notion
that
this
is
a
master-servant
relationship
and
this
court
need
not
consider
the
context
within
which
the
rights
are
exhibited.
and
the
counsel
admits
that
the
claim
of
academic
freedom
runs
contrary
to
the
usual
prerogatives
of
an
--
of
an
employer
but
that
the
claim
of
academic
freedom
and
freedom
of
speech
being
embodied
within
the
first
amendment,
limits
the
state
as
an
employer.
if
these
were
a
private
school
not
subject
to
state
action,
then
we
wouldn't
see
the
problem.
but
being
a
public
school
subject
to
state
action,
it
appears
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporating
the
first
is
a
limitation,
denying
the
state's
power.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it's
subversive.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
would
think
that
this
would
control
that.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
person
can
be
dismissed
for
insubordination
such
as
beilan
or
lerner
against
casey.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
initial
screen
is
an
attempt
to
produce
a
group
of
people
who
will
be
then
qualified
to
teach
at
the
university
of
washington.
that
initial
screen
requires
that
by
precept
and
example,
they
teach
certain
doctrines
and
then
that
they
will
not
teach
by
any
means
to
certain
other
doctrines.
so
that
we
really
have
two
groups,
we
have
the
large
group
from
which
people
may
very
well
be
selected
but
the
state,
using
the
condition
of
freedom
of
speech,
of
association,
says
that
on
the
basis
of
these
conditions,
you
have
to
agree
that
you
will
do
certain
things
and
that
you
will
not
teach
other
things,
that
you
will
associate
in
a
certain
way
and
that
you
will
not
associate
in
a
certain
way,
then
you
will
be
able
to
teach
at
the
university
of
washington.
now,
it
seems
that
that
is
our
point
because
it
requires
that
the
faculty
member
have
a
preordained
conception
of
mind
that
he
has
to
agree
with
the
--
what
might
very
well
be
a
transit
whim
of
the
majority
of
those
legislatures
of
the
state
of
washington
as
to
what
is
proper
and
preceptive.
now
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
believe
that
he
wouldn't
--
if
he
signed
this
oath,
he
wouldn't
teach
those
things
for
fear
of
a
possible
prosecution
or
dismissal.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
was
very
careful
in
answering
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
not
to
say
that
that
second
part
is
not
an
issue.
the
fact,
they
will
swear
to
support
the
constitution
of
united
states.
there
are
some
things
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
--
i
can't
say
that
mr.
valentine
would
swear
to
support
the
laws.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
said,
i
only
did
not
object
to
supporting
of
the
constitution.
i'd
be
very
specific
in
restricting
myself
and
not
saying
that
the
--
would
support
the
laws.
now,
the
only
thing
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
as
counsel,
i
have
to
represent
mr.
valentine.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
as
counsel,
i
have
to
represent
mr.
valentine.
he
object
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
as
counsel,
i
must
represent
mr.
valentine
and
he
objects.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
the
fact
that
he
did
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
not.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
oh.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
would
think
that
the
sit-in
demonstrations
and
the
passive
resistance
movement
that
we
have
in
our
country
demonstrate
that
when
need
not
or
could
not
necessarily
be
called
upon
to
support
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
"law".
mr.
arval
a.
morris
if
it
is
law,
i
believe
they
should
obey.
i'm
--
and
i
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it's
a
valid
law,
he
should
--
he
should
follow
it.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
support
by
precept
and
example,
i
take
it
means
support
by
word
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that's
not
what
the
oath
says,
your
honor,
it
says
by
word
and
example.
example
is
to
obey
the
law
but
here
we
are
coercing
speech.
he
may
very
well
object
to
the
law.
in
fact,
you
may
want
to
speak
against
the
constitutional
validity
or
against
the
law
by
way
of
repeal
but
by
precept
and
example,
he
has
to
support
it
in
the
sense
of
coercing
his
word.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
i
know
of
no
objection
to
that
or
made
by
any
person.
i
should
think
that
be
a
silly
objection.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
position
i
have
to
maintain
here,
with
respect
to
professor
valentine,
is
that
he
will
take
the
oath
and
support
the
constitution.
he
will
not
support
the
laws
of
the
united
states
if
they
require
him
actively
to
speak
in
favor
of
because
there
are
many
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
that
he
likes
to
speak
against.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
however,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
are
not
saying
that
he
has
any
constitutional
right
to
disobey.
he
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
disobey.
he
must
obey
the
laws
of
this
republic
as
i
see
it
and
then
rely
on
the
orderly
processes
of
government
to
reverse
them.
but
when
the
statute
says
by
precept,
he
shall
support
those
laws.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
legislature,
he
couldn't
speak
for
reversal.
pardon
me,
i
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
repeal.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
and
peaceful
speech
binds
itself
in
the
university
campus.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that
is
our
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
word
were,
"i
will
obey
the
--
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states,"
we
would
have
no
objection.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
may
very
well
be.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
district
court
passed
on
the
prior
restrain
argument.
i
assume
that
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
--
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
passed
on
the
prior
restrain
argument
with
respect
to
this
statute.
and
i
would
assume
that
in
the
argument
made
there
may
here
as
the
same.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
we
would
--
that
is
not
our
argument
in
any
sense
of
the
term.
in
fact,
i
would
argue
to
the
contrary.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
should
see
no
difficulty
there
but
restricted
to
support
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
this
reads
to
the
support
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
and
also
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
an
undivided
allegiance
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
if
support
means
obey,
then
i
would
see
--
and
i
think
your
arguments
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
we're
in
a
neverland
but
the
term
"support"
in
the
united
states
constitution
i
take
it
would
mean
that
a
member
of
congress
couldn't
advocate
that
amendment
would
be
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
then
i
would
accept
the
interpretation
completely
wherein
any
members
of
the
state
university.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
basically,
i
don't
believe
any
professor
does
with
the
exception
of
professor
valentine
and
he
is
the
only
one
that
i
know
of,
of
all
the
professors
at
university
of
washington,
some
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
he
is
--
he's
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
he
is
before
this
court.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
with
reference
to
professor
valentine,
maintained
his
integrity
of
his
position.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he's
the
only
one.
the
rest
object
to
the
rest
of
the
--
from
beginning
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
that
i
will
by
precept
and
example,
they
all
object
to
the
remaining
part.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
of
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
support
for
reverence
for
law
and
order.
as
a
law
professor
is
sometimes
hard
to
maintain
in
the
sense
that
you're
going
to
promote
a
reverence
or
all
or
inspirational
quality
for
law
and
frequently
is
the
--
subjected
to
the
dissecting
rationale
of
the
--
the
reason.
it
seems
that
this
consistent
impulse
starts.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
would
think
that
the
word
"reverence"
means
are
inspiring,
sort
of
a
--
a
religious
intonation.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
would
be
first
to
argue,
the
first
amendment
is
law
but
i
believe
that
is
an
attempt
to
obviate
the
broad
diversity
of
dissent
that
first
amendment
protects.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
in
terms
of
obeying
the
law,
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
fine.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
professor
did
not
object
to
that
statement
for
that
is
not
necessarily
the
construction
of
the
--
these
terms.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
shouldn't
--
i
should
like
to
know
what
a
professor
of
physics
or
a
professor
of
mathematics
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
comply.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
although,
it
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
oh,
well,
yes.
i
didn't
get
to
the
disclaimer
oath
and
i
notice
that
time
has
passed
for
rebuttal.
but
the
subversive
person
section
catches
up
the
assistant
to
the
assistant
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
sweezy.
it
also
makes
the
professor
the
captive
of
his
student
in
the
sense
that
it
says
a
subversive
person
is
any
professor
who
teaches
by
any
means,
any
person
to
aid
in
the
commission
of
any
act
intended
to
assist
in
the
alteration
of
government
by
revolution,
force
or
violence.
the
foreign
subversive
organization
--
organization
section
is
not
qualified
by
the
terms
"revolution,
force
or
violence"
and
any
student
who
should
listen
to
a
professor
teach
by
any
means
and
then
commit
an
act
intended
to
overthrow,
it
can
basically
makes
the
professor
a
captive
of
his
student.

sir.
mr.

thank
you,
your
honor.
the

has
argued
several
points.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
one
or
two.
the
first,
as
the
state
correctly
argues,
the
subversive
person
section
of
the
disclaimer
oath
does
not
originate
in
the
1955
legislation
but
it
originates
in
the
1951
legislation.
i
have
it
before
me.
it
states,
"every
person
who
shall
be
in
the
employ
of
the
state
of
washington
shall
be
required
to
make
a
written
statement
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
that
he
or
she
is
not
a
subversive
person."
then
it
goes
on
to
state,
"any
such
person
failing
or
refusing
to
execute
such
a
statement
or
who
admits
he
has
a
subversive
person,
as
defined
in
this
act,
shall
immediately
be
discharged."
it
does
not
afford
the
opportunity
of
a
hearing.
this
is
further
corroborated
by
the
agreed
fact
on
page
169
of
the
record
where
the
--
the
counsels
have
agreed
that
execution
of
the
required
oaths
on
forms
a
and
b,
described
in
the
paragraph
immediately
above
as
"oath
form
a",
is
made
by
statute
and
action
of
the
defendant
regents
a
condition
precedent
to
any
and
all
employment
at
the
university
of
washington.
that
means
that
if
a
tenure
professor
should
ask
for
a
hearing,
he
should
be
granted
a
hearing.
the
only
question
is
who
is
--
did
he
signed
the
oath?
if
he
failed
to
sign
and
if
this
is,
as
stated
here
as
it
is,
an
absolute
requirement
work
--
employment,
then
it
is
clear
that
it's
a
sham
hearing.
there
simply
is
no
hearing
for
the
tenured
professor.
there
are
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
what
happened,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute
was
passed
in
1955.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
was
immediately
enjoined
by
the
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
lower
court
in
the
state
of
washington.
that
was
appealed
to
the
washington
state
supreme
court
that
reversed
but
they
maintained
the
injunction
pending
appeal
to
this
court.
this
court
heard
argument,
had
briefs
and
then
sent
back
the
case
for
decision
on
the
hearing
question.
the
lower
court
--
pardon
me,
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
wrote
a
very
broad
and
discursive
opinion
in
which
the
section
19
was
argued
and
what
have
you
--
and
that
the
lower
--
the
state
supreme
court
refuse
to
take
that
into
account.
and
then
they
came
back
here
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
net
result
is
that
this
oath
and
the
statute
have
been
enjoined
for
the
last
nine
years.
consequently,
there
would
be
a
low
level
enforcement.
consequently,
what
would
necessarily
in
suit
except
for
the
time
when
the
injunction
in
nostrand
against
little
was
dissolved.
now,
that
point,
then
a
new
demand
was
made
on
all
faculty
on
may
28th,
1962,
that
they
execute
oath
form
a
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
at
page
304
in
the
record
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
the
1931
oath
is
an
annual
oath.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
this
is
an
annual.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
the
--
the
oath
itself
is
a
one
shot
arrangement
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
yes,
sir.
now
--
but
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
the
question
i'd
like
to
speak
to
is
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
non-tenured
member
of
the
faculty
before
this
court
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
aliens
are
also
before
this
court
quite
contrary
what
the
state
says.
on
page
304,
there's
an
actual
demand
that
alien,
professor
didrickson
signed
the
oath.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
state
supreme
court
has
passed
on
all
of
the
substantive
first
amendment
issues
that
we
raised
would
depend
and
it
--
including
other
issues
as
well,
the
bill
of
attainder
issue
and
self-incrimination
issue.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
i
wasn't
here
in
that
case.
i
believe
that
this
court,
in
that
second
case,
had
before
it
the
argument
of
bill
of
attainder,
the
argument
that
underneath
the
balancing
test,
vagueness
was
not
raised,
preemption
was
raised.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
was
--
was
not
raised
in
the
second
--
nostrand
against
little
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
--
case
on
appeal
here.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
was
raised
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
the
vagueness
question
had
been
argued
in
the
state
supreme
court
but
i
don't
believe
counsel
pressed
that
here.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
it
depends
whether
it's
true,
if
it's
true
faith
and
allegiance
to
a
particular
government
of
the
united
states,
i
would
--
mr.
arval
a.
morris
oh,
well,
that's
an
excellent
oath
and
i
would
assume
that
no
member
of
the
faculty
would
be
adverse
to
swearing
that,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
well,
true
faith
and
allegiance
to
the
constitution
of
united
states
would
include
the
first
amendment
when
--
i
think
that
would
be.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
now
is
who
has
to
sign
the
1931
oath?
the
section
of
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
by
definition
it
says,
"every
professor,
instructor
or
teacher
must
execute
the
oath."
it
uses
the
term
"professor".
secondly,
on
page
303
and
304,
there
was
an
actual
demand
and
refusal
made
upon
professor
didrickson,
an
alien,
a
citizen
of
norway.
the
--
the
president
of
the
university
of
washington,
his
testimony
was
introduced
by
the
state,
has
stated
that
the
demand
of
may
28th
was
a
demand
that
all
members
of
the
faculty
execute
the
oath.
and
what
actually
occurred
was
that
we
have
a
new
president
as
of
1958.
i
take
it
that
he
made
the
decision
not
to
continue
the
old
policy
but
this
was
unknown
to
professor
aldenderfer.
mr.
arval
a.
morris
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
discretion
here.
it's
a
statutory
oath
prescribed
by
the
legislature
that
the
second
section
says
that
it
will
apply
to
every
professor,
every
instructor.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
new
president,
president
(inaudible)
came
in
1958.
he
simply
stated
that
everyone
has
to
sign.
i
don't
know
whether
he
planned
to
continue
the
old
practice
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
it
would
be
misfeasance
of
office
to
have
him
scratching
out
the
statutory
wording
of
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
