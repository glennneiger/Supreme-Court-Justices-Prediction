appellants,
versus

et
al.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
wait
a
moment
until
counsel
gets
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
morris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
last
sentence?
i
didn't
get
what
you
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
read
this,
this
--
this
requirement
as
--
as
a
meaning
that
a
religionist
could
not
conscientiously
sign
it
because
--
because
it
says
here
that
it
must
be
undivided
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states,
do
you
interpret
it
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
don't
care
about
professor
jordan.
i'm
asking
you,
you're
arguing
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
your
--
has
your
supreme
court
so
interpreted
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
interpretation
has
your
supreme
court
put
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
we
put
that
interpretation
on
the
second
part
of
the
--
of
the
first
oath,
why
wouldn't
he
be
liable
in
the
same
way
under
the
first
part
of
it
where
he
says,
"i
will
support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america"?
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
laws.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
--
i'm
not
asking
for
mr.
valentine.
i'm
asking
you
about
--
about
your
legal
theory
and
principle.
what
is
the
difference
between
those,
in
that
perspective,
between
those
two
parts
of
that
one
--
of
that
one
oath
because
he
does
say
in
the
first
part,
"i,
the
undersigned,
do
solemnly
swear
that
i
will
support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america"?
now,
you
--
you
told
us
in
the
beginning
that
you
didn't
object
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
you
do
object
to
that
part
of
the
--
of
the
first
sentence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
"support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
support
that
--
do
you
support
that
in
--
in
legal
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
support
that
as
a
lawyer
here
before
this
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
what
your
client
objects
to
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
now,
we're
getting
right
back
to
what
i
asked
you.
you
said
--
i
understood
you
to
say
to
justice
clark
that
--
that
no
one
would
object
to
say
that's
--
support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that
you
didn't
agree
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
you
are
supporting
legally
his
position
that
he
does
not
have
to
say
that
he
will
support
the
laws
as
well
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
--
you
also
argue
do
you
not
that
--
that
if
the
oath
said
this
and
no
more,
that
you
would
still
object
to
it,
"i,
the
undersigned,
do
solemnly
swear
that
i
will
support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america."
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
the
word
of
--
"support"
is
the
word
used.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
the
only
one
out
of
these
64
that
takes
that
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fuller.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
record
--
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
doesn't
it
have
the
sanction
of
perjury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
who's
going
to
pose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
morris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
a
little
louder
please?
