mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
yes,
your
honor.
honorable
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
i
should
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
religious
aspects,
which
several
of
you
have
already
inquired
about,
that
is
--
is
--
either
of
these
oaths,
the
1931
oath,
which
you
have
been
talking
about
mostly
or
the
1955
disclaimer
oath,
in
any
way
invade
the
free
exercise
of
religion
of
these
plaintiffs
or
indeed
invade
their
conscience,
which
i
believe
is
also
protected
by
the
--
the
first
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
several
cases
of
this
court
point
that
way,
that
is
first,
barnette,
it
seems
to
me
which
is
cast
somewhat
in
the
complexion
of
this
case
where
there
was
a
compulsory
oath
of
allegiance
or
a
compulsory
act
whereby
these
children
were
sought
to
be
patriotic
or
to
be
nationalistic
and
the
court
struck
this
down
as
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
of,
of
course,
the
religion,
the
jehovah's
witness
religion,
of
these
children.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
concept
has
been
carried
forth
recently
here,
in
this
court,
in
the
case
of
sherbert
against
verner,
which
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief,
although
we
did
cite
schempp,
which
i
think
also
carries
forth
this
concept.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
herein,
the
present
context
of
this
case,
we
have
conditioned
of
employment
that
the
professor
will
give
an
undivided
allegiance
to
the
united
states
from
oath
respect
for
reverent
--
in
reverence
of
law
and
order,
etcetera,
that
we
have
talked
about
earlier.
in
addition,
under
the
disclaimer
oath,
these
professors
are
asked
to
say
that
they
are
not
subversive
persons
or
have
not
knowingly
joined
a
subversive
organization
or
a
foreign
subversive
organization,
which
we
believed,
and
the
professors
have
stated
this
on
pages
188
and
189
of
the
record
in
an
agreed
statement
of
fact,
on
agreed
fact,
first,
that
they
believe
all
of
the
professors,
i'm
now
talking
about
all
of
the
professors
rather
than
two,
to
whom
i
will
address
myself
in
a
moment,
that
all
of
the
professors
feel
that
the
oaths
are
a
violation
of
their
conscience.
the
preceding
finding
of
fact
on
page
188
relates
solely
to
two
professors
who
are
quakers,
one
of
whom
professor
matchett
is
tenured,
one
of
whom
professor
orians
who
is
non-tenured.
they
have
asserted
that
in
an
agreed
statement
--
in
an
agreed
fact
that
the
oath
violates
their
religion
specifically,
the
quaker
religion.
now,
quakers,
as
i
understand
it,
don't
have
an
undivided
allegiance
to
temporal
power.
these
gentlemen
have
an
allegiance
if
we
use
that
word
of
that
strength
or
they
have
a
feeling
or
a
devotion
or
a
sympathy
for
people,
for
human
beings,
for
human
needs.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
this
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
true.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
problems
of
the
oath,
if
your
honor
please,
that
no
human
being
can
and
if
this
is
true,
why
should
the
state,
as
a
condition
of
employment,
suggests
that
human
beings
do
something
which
is
in
fact
untrue
which
leads
to
hypocrisy
and
particularly
when
this
is
based
in
the
framework
of
teaching
young
people.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
if
your
honor
please,
i
suggest
that
barnette,
a
simple
flag
salute,
which
i
think
most
of
us
would
agree
with
accepting
for
the
religious
overtones
that
people
would
be
able
to
salute
the
flag
in
that
case.
these
youngsters
and
their
parents
stated
that
it
was
against
their
religion
that
they
not
have
a
graven
image.
now,
this
case
as
in
barnette,
if
these
gentlemen
assert
that
they
cannot
sign
because
of
reasons
of
conscience,
their
assertions
of
first
amendment
freedoms
is
not
running
into
or
colliding
with
the
assertions
of
anybody
else.
everybody
else,
if
they
wish,
can
take
this
oath.
the
only
persons
who
would
not
be
taking
it
would
be
as
in
barnette,
those
people
who
felt
that
it
was
contrary
to
their
religion.
now,
secondly,
i
think
that
the
extension,
if
you
--
if
i
may
so
call
it,
of
the
free
exercise
in
sherbert
takes
up
this
case,
that
is
if
the
seventh
day
adventist
in
north
or
south
carolina,
i
--
feels
that
her
free
exercise
of
religion
has
in
anyway
been
prohibited
by
reason
of
her
losing
her
employment
and
not
under
state
statute
being
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
then
i
suggest
that
the
condition
imposed
upon
these
professors
is
precisely
the
same
type
of
condition
and
is
indeed
a
prohibition
of
the
free
exercise.
now,
question,
of
course,
is
what
is
religion?
does
religion
run
over
into
conscience
and
is
conscience
protected?
i
suggest
that
both
under
barnette,
under
speiser
against
randall,
certainly
under
cantwell
against
connecticut
that
a
person's
free
conscience
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
applicable
to
the
states.
and
i
suggest
that
if
this
is,
if
it
is
indeed,
a
violation
or
an
intrusion
upon
the
rights
of
these
professors,
then
i
think
that
the
mandate
of
the
first
amendment
should
takeover
even
though
this
court
might
think
that
this
is
but
a
limited
invasion.
the
court
has
spoken.
justice
madison
has
spoken
in
the
past
of
the
dangers
of
what
is
now
a
limited
invasion
and
later
maybe
a
torrent.
now,
i
feel
that
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment,
and
i
regarded
as
a
charter
of
our
government,
is
applicable
to
this
case
that
we
are
faced
with
state
action
and
that
the
rights
of
conscience
of
all
of
the
professors
as
opposed
to
the
--
were
limited,
i
may
call
them,
religious
rights
of
two
of
the
professors
have,
in
fact,
been
affected
as
by
what
we
call
an
unconstitutional
condition
of
employment.
now,
we
are
not
asking,
i
am
not
asking
that
the
oaths
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
as
to
all
persons,
only
as
to
those
persons
who
seek
to
raise
the
issue
of
conscience.
i
mentioned
to
justice
--
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
on
the
question
of
what
difference
does
it
make
and
i
think
that
it
makes
some
difference
in
the
environment
in
which
we're
acting
again
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
i
am
arguing
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
yes,
i
am
arguing
--
i
am
arguing
that.
and
i
am
arguing,
i
believe
something
further
which
would
be
implicit
and
it
is
this
that
there
is
no
hearing
that
we
can
see
under
the
statute.
this
has
come
up
before
this
court,
has
been
sent
back
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
hearing
under
the
disclaimer
oath
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
said,
"no."
when
your
remand
went
down,
it
asks
the
court
there
to
act
--
to
assert
if
there
was
a
hearing
at
which
these
professors
could
explain
or
defend.
the
answer
was
no.
although
the
court
said,
as
mr.
fuller
will
advise
you
that
there
was
a
hearing
for
tenured
professors
under
the
university
of
washington
tenure
program.
however,
we
have
asserted
in
our
brief
what
--
that
this
is
--
in
essence
a
sham
hearing
because
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
washington
acting
under
their
delegated
authorities,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
white,
have
said,
if
the
answer
is
that
such
a
hearing
that
i
will
not
sign
then
that
the
state,
through
its
regents,
will
follow
the
law
and
will
discharge
these
professors.
now,
i
would
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
even
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
no.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
there
are
--
that
--
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
yes.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
is
that
tenured
professors
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
consistent,
however,
with
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
and
if
the
answer
is
that
the
professor
has
not
signed
the
oath,
then
he
shall
be
discharged.
mr.
kenneth
a.
macdonald
in
fact,
no
hearing
has
been
held
at
this
time,
as
of
--
of
--
at
this
time.
now,
i
feel,
moreover,
if
your
honor
please,
that
if
such
a
hearing,
even
if
it
were
to
be
held,
even
if
it
were
allowable
under
state
law,
an
interpretation
has
been
to
the
contrary,
i
think
that
under
the
free
exercise
cases
and
even
under
the
establishment
cases,
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
first
amendment
to
have
these
professors
go
before
that
hearing
and
explain
their
reason
or
what
is
their
conscience
based
upon
and
what
is
their
religion
based
upon,
which
i
think
is
an
added
defect
of
the
present
situation.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time,
if
the
court
please,
for
mr.
morris
on
rebuttal.
