mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
may
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commission
believes
that
the
existence
of
an
effective
private
remedy
for
violation
of
the
proxy
rules
is
important
to
the
congressional
purpose
of
making
proxy
regulation
reasonably
complete
and
effective.
we
here
have
only
the
question
of
whether
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
to
grant
adequate
rel
--
relief
and
not
as
to
what
relief
should
be
granted
in
the
particular
case
or
even
whether
plaintiff
has
pleaded
the
case
or
will
be
able
to
prove
one.
it
has
been
said
that
the
proxy
rules
are
the
most
effective
disclosure
device
in
the
sec
scheme
of
things.
on
the
other
hand,
they
are
among
the
more
difficult
to
enforce
because
of
the
volume
of
worked,
there
are
2000
or
so
every
year.
they
usually
have
to
be
cleared
in
10
days
and
the
sanctions
available
to
the
commission
under
the
statute
are
somewhat
limited.
there
are
no
administrative
sanctions,
only
injunctive
actions
and
criminal
prosecutions.
the
problem
of
remedies
becomes
more
acute
in
a
case
such
as
this,
is
alleged
to
be
where
the
deficiencies
and
the
proxy
statement
or
at
least
many
of
them
could
not
be
discovered
until
some
time
after
the
trans
--
the
meeting
in
view
of
the
facts
which
later
came
to
light.
in
such
a
situation,
we
would
have
some
trouble
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
equity
to
enjoin
a
proxy
solicitation
where
the
proxies
had
already
been
solicited,
the
meeting
had
been
had
and
the
transaction
had
been
completed.
it
might
well
be
that
the
district
court
would
say,
"we
no
longer
had
equity
to
enjoin
the
proxy
solicitation."
if
so,
the
only
remedy
open
to
us
is
criminal
prosecution
and
that's
rather
heavy
artillery.
according
to
mr.
lassers'
definitive
text,
there
had
been
only
three
or
four
indictments
in
which
proxy's
violations
were
included
among
the
charges
and
none
before
1960.
i
next
going
to
point
out
that
contrary
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
at
length
by
the
petitioners,
respondent's
right
of
action
does
not
depend
upon
a
--
an
affirmative
finding
that
congress
intended
in
the
exchange
act
to
create
this
particular
right.
the
foundation
of
respondent's
rights
is
really
based
upon
the
common
law.
in
comyns'
digest,
quoted
by
this
court
in
texas
&
pacific
versus
rigsby,
it
was
said,
"so
in
every
case
where
a
statute
enacts
or
prohibits
a
thing
for
the
benefit
of
a
person,
he
shall
have
a
remedy
upon
the
same
statute
for
the
thing
enacted
for
his
advantage
or
for
the
recompense
of
a
wrong
done
to
him
contrary
to
the
said
law."
it
is
upon
that
common
law
basis
that
this
court
has
created
private
rights
of
action
in
many
situations.
and
it
is
upon
that
common
law
basis
that
the
lower
courts
have
created
private
rights
of
action
under
the
securities
exchange
act.
this
is
expressly
stated
in
the
early
cases,
kardon
versus
national
gypsum,
the
first
case
under
rule
10
(b)
(5),
brown
versus
bullock,
approximately
the
first
case
of
importance
under
the
investment
company
act
and
in
dann
versus
studebaker-packard
which
petitioners
rely
on
here.
section
27
of
the
exchange
act,
it
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners,
merely
grants
jurisdiction
over
actions
created
by
the
act,
causes
of
action.
that
is
not
what
it
says.
it
says
that
it
gives
jurisdiction
over
actions
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duty
created
by
the
act.
it
is
the
liability
or
duty
which
there
is
jurisdiction
to
enforce,
not
merely
a
cause
of
action
created
by
the
act.
professor
lassers
summarized
the
nature
of
the
private
rights
as
follows."
in
short,
the
private
action
under
the
proxy
rules
is
an
action
created
by
the
federal
common
law
and
brought
to
enforce
a
duty
or
liability
created
by
the
commission's
rules
under
section
14
of
the
exchange
act."
that's
73
--
harvard
law
review
1273.
of
course,
we
would
not
say
an
action
should
be
implied
if
congress
affirmatively
did
not
intend
one,
that
there
is
no
showing
of
any
affirmative
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
that
there
should
be
no
remedy
for
violation
of
the
proxy
rules.
petitioners
do
not
suggest
that
there
is
--
was
such
an
intent.
they
merely
think
that
congress
should
have
had
such
an
intention
at
the
most.
there
isn't
--
since
the
purpose
of
proxy
rules
is
to
protect
the
stockholders'
right
of
suffrage
in
view
of
the
problems
of
enforcement
above
mentioned.
no
congressional
intent
to
withhold
private
rights
completely
can
be
--
be
assumed
--
presumed.
secondly,
we
believe
in
the
petitioners'
consent
--
contention
in
the
holding
in
dann
versus
studebaker-packard,
that
stockholders'
rights
under
the
proxy
rules,
in
a
consummated
transaction,
are
limited
to
a
declaratory
judgment,
is
in
--
and
any
other
remedy
must
be
found
under
the
state
law
is
incorrect
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
federal
courts
will
afford
inadequate
remedy
for
breach
of
the
federal
right
and
not
an
inadequate
one.
secondly,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
right
of
action
in
the
federal
courts
for
a
violation
of
a
federally
created
right
is
governed
by
federal
and
not
state
law.
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
effective
state
remedy
or
a
proxy
violation
to
which
the
petitioners
can
appropriately
be
remitted.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
--
aspects
of
that.
first,
the
state
courts
themselves
are
split
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
complete
remedy
or
whether
a
stockholder
may
nevertheless
go
into
court
and
seek
that
to
upset
the
transaction
on
the
ground
of
unfairness.
as
the
--
the
juries
of
the
court
put
that
matter
in
bingham
versus
savings
and
trust
company,
138
atlantic
639,
the
plan
must
be
free
from
unfairness
before
the
complainants
can
be
put
to
dereliction
of
joining
their
associates
in
the
merger
or
taking
compensation
in
lieu
thereof.
in
the
second
place,
the
--
this
remedy
of
appraisal
can
be
invoked
only
if
notice
is
given
to
the
corporation
48
hours
before
the
meeting
that
the
stockholder
objects.
at
that
point,
the
only
information
the
stockholder
has
about
the
merger
is
what
is
in
the
proxy
statement.
and
if
it
turns
out
the
--
the
proxy
statement
is
wrong,
he
is
deceived
not
only
in
the
--
his
voting
but
in
this
decision
whether
or
not
to
invoke
his
appraisal
right.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
this
stockholder
did
not,
as
i
understand
it,
invoked
his
appraisal
rights
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
he
did?
i
didn't
know
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
as
to
the
adequate
--
as
to
the
adequacy
of
remedy,
bell
versus
hood
expressly
held
that
the
federal
courts
would
grant
all
necessary
relief,
deckert
versus
independent
share
cited
in
our
brief
said
much
the
same
thing
and
the
line
of
cases
which
follow,
texaco
workers
versus
lincoln
mills,
also
indicate
that
the
federal
courts
under
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
such
as
is
found
at
section
27,
will
frame
adequate
remedies.
secondly,
this
--
the
court
--
federal
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
remedy
to
be
granted
to
enforce
a
federal
right
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
it
was
so
stated
expressly
in
lincoln
mills,
in
sola
electric
cited
in
our
brief,
and
in
tunstall
versus
brotherhood
where
the
court
said,
"the
nature
and
extent
of
the
legal
consequences
of
this
condemnation,
i.e.,
that
a
certain
conduct
is
unlawful,
though
left
by
the
statute
to
judicial
determination
are
nevertheless
to
be
derive
from
it
and
the
federal
policy
which
it
has
adopted."
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
the
union
pacific
versus
--
railroad
versus
chicago
&
northwestern
railway
company,
likewise
involving
an
alleged
proxy
violation
in
relation
to
a
merger
reported
at
326
federal
supplement
400,
we
cited
in
our
brief
by
its
case
number
but
it
has
since
been
reported.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
326
federal
supplement
400.
that
case
is
a
very
instructive
example
of
a
district
court
determining
these
problems,
who
has
standing
to
sue
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
a
proxy
rule,
whether
the
violation
with
the
cause
of
the
injury
complained
of,
what
remedy
was
appropriate.
and
i
must
say
that
the
decision
there
--
there
is
no
resemblance
of
all
--
at
all
to
the
chamber
of
horrors
into
which
mr.
whyte
attempted
to
leave
this
court
earlier.
union
pacific
railroad
company
versus
chicago
&
northwester
railway
co.,
it
is
not
a
point
on
the
question
of
upsetting
a
merger
because
the
merger
has
not
been
--
been
consummated.
but
it
does
show
how
a
court
goes
about
this
when
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
this
--
the
court
in
chicago
had
jurisdiction,
it
thought
because
it
believed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
controlling
in
that
circuit.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
there,
i
would
say,
they
were
somewhat
doubtful
because
it
is
expressly
said
that
we
can
sue
for
an
injunction
and
as
respondent
stated
earlier
in
order
to
go
further,
we
would
have
to,
in
effect,
invoke
an
implied
remedy
too.
i
would
like
in
closing
point
out
that
there
is
virtually
no
state
law
of
proxy
solicitation.
state
statutes
merely
say
that
stockholders
can
vote
by
proxy
and
may
regulate
the
authority
in
the
creation
of
the
proxy
holders'
of
authority.
that
is
all.
consequently,
dann
gives
petitioners
--
i
mean
plaintiffs
any
remedy
which
maybe
totally
illusory.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
situation
in
delaware
which
is
of
course
of
very
important
corporate
state.
but
delaware
--
the
court
of
chancery
held
that
it
would
not
consider
alleged
violations
of
the
proxy
rules
because
the
jurisdiction
to
do
so
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts.
and
therefore,
it
would
grant
only
such
relief
on
account
of
a
proxy
violation
as
it
would
give
if
the
securities
exchange
acts
had
never
been
adopted.
that
is
--
the
decision
is
found
at
48
atlantic
2d
501,
the
investment
associates
versus
standard
power
and
light.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
affirmed,
that
decision
is
found
at
51
atlantic
2d
572
on
the
ground
that
to
grant
any
relief
for
violation
of
the
proxy
rules
would
trespass
upon
the
province
of
the
federal
courts
and
that
even
though
a
serious
violation
soliciting
the
proxy
without
furnishing
any
proxy
statement
appeared
to
have
occurred
that
no
objection
could
be
sustained
because
this
was
not
a
ground
to
challenge
a
proxy
under
the
general
corporation
law
of
delaware.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
holdings
would
leave
--
would
mean
that
a
dann
type
declaratory
judgment
would
afford
rather
scant
comfort
to
a
stockholder
in
a
delaware
corporation.
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
this
action
is
derivative
or
not
and
what
our
view.
our
view
essentially
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
classified
for
state
purposes
as
derivative
or
direct.
that
seems
to
depend
on
which
end
of
the
case
you
approach.
if
you
look
at
the
stockholders'
right
to
have
a
proper
proxy
and
to
cast
and
inform
the
vote,
that
is
clearly
a
direct
right.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
the
only
remedy
that
he
can
obtain
is
through
the
corporation
which
has
been
injured
as
a
result
of
the
violation.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
the
case
in
this
situation
in
this
case.
but
since
we
deal
only
with
federal
jurisdiction,
it
isn't
really
necessary
yet
to
determine
what
remedy
and
whether
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
well
the
--
because
i
believe
that
the
main
we
--
we
are
really
here
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
to
grant
an
effective
remedy
because
as
the
case
came
up,
the
district
court
held
that
it
would
not
apply
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes,
i'm
talking
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
fed
--
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
i
would
think
it
is
in
the
sense
that
if
this
is
not
a
federal
right
that
is
being
invoked
and
assuming
the
action
is
derivative
as
i
think
the
courts
below
thought
then
maybe
the
wisconsin
statute
would
apply.
this
all
came
up
peculiarly
enough
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
--
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
wisconsin
statute
does
not
apply
and
the
courts
below
thought
that
if
this
was
not
a
federal
cause
of
action,
the
wisconsin
statute
would
apply.
and
consequently,
this
case
has
been
considered
all
the
way
on
the
assumption
of,
"is
this
right,
a
federal
one
which
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
diversity
to
uphold.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
as
i
understand
that
the
wisconsin
statute
provides
that
any
stockholder
who
does
not
own
above
5%
of
the
stock
must
put
up
security
if
this
is
demanded
by
the
defendants.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
a
motion
was
made
that
security
must
be
put
up
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
in
a
derivative
action,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
and
--
that's
--
excuse
me
for
omitting
that.
a
motion
--
mr.
philip
a.
loomis,
jr.
yes,
but
cohen
was
a
diversity
case
and
this
court
--
the
courts
below
here
concluded
that
the
state
statute
would
not
apply
to
federal
question
jurisdiction
as
in
borne,
it
was
held
in
mcclure
versus
borne
chemical
and
thus
the
question
of
whether
it
be
classified
as
federal
question
or
diversity
and
that
which
rule
would
apply
here.
the
courts
below
held
that
the
--
that
the
security
had
to
be
posted
as
to
all
parts
of
the
cause
of
action
which
they
found
to
be
based
on
state
law
but
not
as
to
any
part
of
it
which
they
found
to
be
based
on
federal
law.
