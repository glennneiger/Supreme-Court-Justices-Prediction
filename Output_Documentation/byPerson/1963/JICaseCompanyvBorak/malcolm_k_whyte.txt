mr.
malcolm
k.
whyte
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
suppose
it's
not
a
unusual
or
--
or
original
remark
to
say
that
this
case
is
of
considerable
importance.
as
i
conceive
it,
it
does
--
may
have
far
reaching
effects
as
to
the
extent
to
which
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
are
--
will
replace
the
corporation
law
of
the
various
states.
over
the
years,
the
question
of
corporation
law
has
been
left
substantially
entirely
to
this
--
to
the
states.
i
can
recall
i
think
to
--
a
few
times
from
the
last
15
years
where
there
had
been
proposals
in
congress
to
have
a
federal
corporation
law
and
i
don't
think
it
ever
got
out
of
the
committee.
congress
believed
corporation
law
in
general
should
stay
with
the
states.
the
state
laws
spell
out
the
basic
organization
of
a
corporation.
it
base
--
it
spells
out
how
you
could
get
your
stock
subscription,
the
incorporators,
how
you
in
--
amend
it.
how
you
amend
the
certificates,
how
you
elect
directors,
how
you
hold
corporate
meetings
and
how
you
--
that
you
indemnify
for
instance
at
the
present
time
most
of
them,
the
directors
against
suits
that
--
where
they
are
sued
unjustly.
and
the
merger
laws
are
spelled
out
very
carefully
in
the
state
laws.
this
merger
was
under
the
law
of
new
york,
under
the
law
of
wisconsin.
there
was
--
surviving
corporation
was
wisconsin.
to
merge,
you
had
to
comply
with
both
of
the
laws
for
the
american
tractor
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
surviving
company,
the
j.
i.
case
company
whom
i
represent,
on
the
other.
and
it
was
all
--
it's
all
spelled
out
in
the
statutes.
now,
to
what
degree
is
state
law
to
be
test
out
and
pushed
aside
for
federal
law
brought
in
by
implication
and
not
with
specific
act
of
congress.
it's
pretty
much
the
basic
question
we
have
here.
now,
in
the
merger
laws
over
the
years,
i
checked
up
the
other
day
and
my
young
man
reported
to
me
that
in
48
states,
there
is
an
appraisal
statute.
that
is
if
you're
not
satisfied
in
48
of
the
50,
if
you're
not
satisfied
with
your
stockholder,
with
the
merger
as
it
went
through,
you
can
file
a
proceeding
in
your
state
court,
in
the
place
where
the
merger
went
through,
the
state
where
the
merger
was
completed,
and
ask
to
have
your
stock
appraised
as
of
the
day
before
the
merger
and
afterwards.
and
if
the
merger
hasn't
flipped
out
to
your
advantage
according
to
the
determination
of
the
judge
in
that
very
simple
lawsuit,
you
can
take
your
stock
and
hand
it
to
the
company
and
they
have
to
give
you
the
price
that
the
judge
determined.
it's
simple,
it's
efficacious.
i've
never
heard
anyone
say
it
was
unfair
or
cumbersome.
48
states
have
enacted
it
and
they've
done
it
for
two
purposes.
one,
they
give
the
stockholder
a
very
easy
quick
remedy
if
he
doesn't
like
this
merger
which
may
involve
thousands
and
thousands
of
other
stockholders.
he
can
get
a
clean
cut
remedy
on
this
basic
question.
the
other
one
is,
it
prevents
strike
suits
because
if
a
man
doesn't
use
that
efficacious
remedy,
what
right
has
he
got
in
to
come
in
later
and
say,
"i
want
to
upset
the
whole
merger
because
i
don't
like
it.
i
claim
this
was
wrong.
i
claim
that
was
wrong."
if
he
doesn't
use
his
simple
way
of
giving
his
money
back,
48
of
50
states
have
it.
about
half
the
states,
i
think,
have
put
in
provisions
for
undertaking
for
expenses,
not
quite
but
pretty
nearly.
and
that's
an
efficacious
remedy
that
--
and
it
--
an
intentional
thing
that
the
states
have
setup
to
prevent
strike
cases.
they
don't
want
every
individual
stockholder
coming
in
and
suing
to
have
the
merger
--
j.
i.
case,
i
think
they
had
8500
stockholders
when
this
transaction
took
place
and
now
has
15,000
or
20,000.
nobody
--
to
prevent
them
coming
in
with
strike
cases,
they
put
in
this
supervision
for
undertaking
for
cause.
if
you're
attempting
to
upset
the
whole
corporate
structure,
you
should
give
some
protection
to
the
defending
corporation
and
its
stockholders.
now,
should
there
be
a
national
policy
subordinating
and
throwing
out
all
of
these
things
that
had
been
put
in
by
the
state,
in
order
that
by
implication
--
now,
let's
spend
a
moment
or
two,
i
think
the
implication
that
they've
asked
for
here
is
pretty
flinching.
in
the
appendix
of
our
main
brief
for
the
j.
i.
case
company
on
page
1
of
the
appendix,
we
set
out
the
various
statutes
and
i
want
to
refer
to
a
few
of
them.
section
9
has
a
provision
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
that
if
there
is
a
manipulation
of
security
prices
to
--
by
false
purchases
and
sales
on
the
market
and
so
forth,
a
person
who
is
injured
can
sue
but
provided
he
puts
up
an
undertaking
for
cause.
also,
provided
that
he
can
get,
if
he
hurt
someone,
he
gets
judgment.
that
man
can
get
contribution
from
others
who
were
related
with
them.
they
give
him
contribution
as
to
defense
or
partial
help
to
him.
and
number
three,
they
put
in
the
statute
of
limitations
to
protect
the
man
who's
being
sued.
one
year
from
the
time
of
knowledge,
three
years
complete.
so
that's
the
federal
law
on
the
manipulation
of
security
prices.
then
on
--
let
me
spend
one
moment
on
section
16,
the
use
and
abuse
of
confidential
information
by
officers,
directors,
stockholders
who
own
more
than
10%
of
the
stock
and
so
forth.
anyone
injured
by
unfair
use
of
this
information
is
given
by
the
statute
a
specific
federal
remedy
and
it
runs
in
favor
of
the
issuer
only,
and
--
but
to
protect
the
defendant,
a
statute
limitations
are
put
in.
two
years
in
this
case
only,
not
longer.
the
other
--
the
other
was
one
in
three.
section
18,
is
a
very
elaborately
drawn
statute
imposing
liability
for
making
misleading
statements
in
registration
statements
and
the
like.
now,
that
gives
the
defendant
there
a
number
of
defenses.
number
one,
the
person
sued
has
a
defense
if
he
can
prove
he
acted
in
good
faith.
that's
in
the
federal
statute
where
they
provided
the
special
remedy.
number
two,
the
plaintiff
asked
to
put
up
an
undertaking
for
cause.
number
three,
the
defendant
liable
--
who
was
made
liable
can
recover
contribution,
and
number
four
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
again.
one
year
from
the
time
of
finding
out,
three
years
in
any
event.
now,
that's
what
the
congress
put
in
when
you
have
special
remedies.
now,
we're
in
a
situation
with
section
14
and
they
say,
"let's
imply
special
remedies
here."
section
14
hasn't
--
gives
no
remedy
at
all.
it
states
in
essence
that
it's
unlawful
for
any
person
to
solicit
a
proxy
for
securities
register
in
an
--
on
a
national
exchange
in
contravention
of
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe
as
necessary.
on
pages
18
to
28
of
the
appendix,
i've
--
we've
copied
the
proxy
rules
that
they
have,
the
commission
has
thus
far
prescribed.
those
proxy
rules
now
take
20
pages.
i
understand
10
years
ago,
there
were
about
10
pages.
i
have
no
doubt
that
20
years
from
now,
there
will
be
50
pages
if
they
expand
as
the
normal
progression
of
our
--
the
world
develops.
and
you'll
notice
that
isn't
just
contravention
of
proxy
rules
relating
to
fraud
or
amounting
to
something
vicious
or
something.
its
violation
of
any
proxy
rule
that
they
may
make
hereafter
is
unlawful.
now,
the
basic
contention
of
the
plaintiff
here
is
that
that
language
gives
him
a
personal
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court
to
upset
any
merger
if
he
can
claim
a
violation
of
any
proxy
rule
at
all
and
it
can
be
proved.
under
section
29
of
the
act,
there's
a
very
sweeping
language
that
he
wants
to
bring
in
with
him.
it
says
under
--
in
section
29,
that
any
contract
made
in
violation
of
any
provision
of
this
chapter
or
any
rule
or
regulation
made
thereunder.
it
really
goes
all
the
way,
is
void.
so
he
says,
by
ipso
facto
if
there
is
something
wrong
about
the
proxy
anywhere
at
all,
then
the
merger
agreement
is
void
and
then
under
the
plain
language
of
section
29,
the
whole
mergers
is
void,
and
let's
start
over.
i
think
that's
going
pretty
far.
now,
i
want
to
suggest
why
congress
didn't
put
a
remedy
in
for
section
14,
and
it
is
that
just
because
it's
too
broad
to
let
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
spell
out
page
after
page,
50
pages
of
rule.
we'll
say,
with
hundreds
--
with
a
100
do's
and
50
don'ts
or
something.
and
every
one
of
those,
if
you're
violating
the
law
and
in
every
one
under
section
29,
an
individual
can
come
in
later
and
say,
"never
mind
the
state
law
on
a
claim
there's
a
violation
of
the
proxy
rules
and
let's
set
the
--
let's
set
the
merger
aside
and
start
all
over."
mr.
malcolm
k.
whyte
yes.
mr.
malcolm
k.
whyte
yes.
i'm
--
that's
the
point
i'm
getting
to.
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
this
type
of
relief
is
just
impossible
for
practical
administration.
the
idea
is,
as
i
gather,
and
as
professor
lowe
(ph)
said
so
and
i
realized
that.
let's
leave
it
all
to
the
court.
the
district
courts
will
handle
this
just
rightly,
they'll
do
it
beautifully.
now,
our
first
question
when
we
get
to
the
district
court
is,
the
violation
of
the
proxy
rule,
they
probably
claim
as
you
omitted
something
that
was
--
that
made
something
else
misleading.
now,
every
proxy
i've
had
--
every
proxy
statement
i've
ever
had
anything
to
do
with,
you
of
course
put
in
the
history
of
the
company.
and
it's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
with
hindsight
to
say
you
omitted
something
in
the
history
of
the
company.
certainly,
it's
not
obvious
to
the
trial
judge
when
we
get
there
whether
there
was
something
misleading.
it's
a
question
in
context
of
economic
and
financial
facts
whether
the
thing
omitted
was
material.
you
have
to
put
in,
in
your
good
proxy
statement,
of
course,
a
statement
about
your
competition,
where
you
are.
and
isn't
--
the
one
that
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
say
while
you
left
out
an
important
thing,
you're
an
electrical
company
and
you
left
out
this
very
important
new
passage
of
general
electric
had
been
announced
to
have
taken
or
something
of
that
kind.
you
left
something
out
and
that's
going
to
be
the
first
issue
of
trial
with
experts
on
both
sides
in
the
federal
court,
was
there
something
misleading
omitted?
and
it's
to
be
tried
by
an
individual
who
claims
he
represents
stockholders
and
the
whole
thing
maybe
greatly
to
the
financial
detriment
of
the
company
that's
doing
the
best
it
can
to
keep
operating
and
to
confront
--
confront
the
world
as
it
is
in
the
financial
situation
that
it's
in.
and
he's
going
to
take
the
burden
on
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
lawsuit,
then
we're
really
going
to
have
a
real
triumph
because
they
say,
let's
readjust
the
securities.
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
brief
says.
that's
the
security
and
exchange
commission
says.
and
they
really
make
to
my
mind,
one
of
the
most
remarkable
statements
that
i
would
almost
brand
as
naïve.
and
i
wonder
if
i'm
making
it
too
strongly.
in
page
27,
he
says
--
the
solicitor
general,
this
sec
brief.
they
say,
"after
all,
there's
very
little
difference
between
delaying,
by
the
security
and
exchange
commission,
a
corporate
stockholders'
meeting
and
requiring
a
new
republication."
this
is
subordinated
in
the
footnote.
they
say
there's
very
little
difference
in
that
and
readjusting
the
securities
of
the
whole
thing
afterwards.
there's
no
difference
between
delaying
a
stockholders'
meeting
and
in
opening
up,
he
says,
in
principle,
the
merger
years
later,
and
having
it
all
rechecked.
well,
i
think
there
is
a
--
that
it's
a
good
deal,
like
saying
there's
little
difference
in
principle
between
a
parking
fine
and
capital
punishment
by
boiling
an
oil.
i
can't
conceive
of
things
that
are
more
different
than
reopening
these
mergers
year
after
the
--
a
few
years
after
they
have
taken
place.
but
let's
say
we
get
in
this
case
to
a
reopening
of
the
merger
at
the
instance
of
an
individual.
we're
going
to
then
have
battles.
we're
going
to
have,
number
one,
experts
on
both
sides,
and
the
first
question
the
court
is
going
to
--
could
be
confronted
with.
how
should
the
merger
have
been
properly
done
if
there
hadn't
been
this
omission
of
some
important
material
fact
or
something
which
in
the
light
of
hindsight
now
seems
quite
important?
how
will
we
--
how
should
it
have
been
done
of
january,
in
our
case
1957.
and
we're
going
to
marshal
experts.
and
those
experts
have
to
be
financial.
they
have
to
be
economic.
they
have
to
know
all
about
the
industry
certainly
and
the
plaintiff
will
have
his
row
of
experts
and
the
company
will
have
ours.
and
the
court
will
have
to
decide
what
would've
been
a
good
merger
in
january,
1957.
what
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be
unrealistic.
that's
only
(inaudible).
there'd
been
and
let's
say
this
comes
on
in
1965.
now,
he's
got
eight
or
nine
years
have
gone.
then
this
--
the
district
court
--
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
will
then
probably
say,
"while
we
must
also
take
into
account
the
economic
changes
since."
and
so
i
guess,
you
bring
in
an
economist
and
experts
on
the
question
since
and
say,
"now,
what
should
we
do
to
make
this
merger
a
nice
merger
now,
because
a
lot
of
time
has
gone
over
the
dam."
then
i
don't
want
to
be
too
fictitious
about
it
but
then
the
court
should
be
realistic
enough
to
say,
"well
if
i
do
put
in
a
decree
in
june,
1965,
readjusting
this
merger
like
i
think
now
after
all
this
expert
advise,
it
should
have
been
done
eight
years
ago."
then
i
must
be
realistic
to
know
it
won't
go
into
effect
for
a
year
or
two
because
they're
going
to
be
appeals.
and
i
should
project
the
future
economic
and
financial
situation
of
this
company
in
order
to
have
to
a
realistic
decree.
and
perhaps
the
financial
world
will
be
much
obliged
for
the
judges'
opinion
on
what's
going
to
happen
but
i'm
not
sure.
anyhow
to
me,
it
seems
a
farfetched
affair.
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
take
much
more
time
now
on
this.
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
6,
we
have
--
i
wrote
out
longhand
the
other
day
as
an
intellectual
exercise,
what
i
conceive
the
amendment
they're
asking
the
court
to
make
to
section
14.
the
amendment
that
they
asked
to
have
put
in
by
a
--
an
implication

so

section
14
(c),
this
is
what
they
want
the
court
to
decide
by
implication.
and
that
is,
any
stockholder
who
alleges,
that's
all
he
has
to
do,
within
a
merger
proceeding
involving
his
company,
a
proxy
was
used
in
contravention
of
the
rules
and
regulation
of
the
commission
as
provided
in
the
above,
shall
be
entitled
to
bring
an
action
under
section
27
of
this
title.
in
such
action,
provisions
of
state
law,
such
as
the
requirements
for
securities
for
cause,
statutes
of
limitation
or
appraisal
statutes.
even
though
part
of
the
state
merger
law
in
which
the
merger
was
--
under
which
the
merger
was
consummated
shall
not
apply
to
a
plaintiff,
nor
shall
the
court
require
a
security
for
cause
to
be
posted
by
any
plaintiff
unless
expressly
provided
for
by
federal
statute
here
and
after
enacted.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
they're
asking
this
court
to
hold.
then,
this
is
what
their
whole
asking,
i
think.
if
after
a
trial,
the
court
shall
find
that
any
proxies
were
utilized,
pursuant
to
a
proxy
statement
which
was
in
any
respect
in
violation
of
the
rules
and
regulations
specified
above,
such
as
by
omission
whether
intentional
or
inadvertent.
certainly,
they're
not
going
to
conceive
to
us
that
good
faith
is
a
defense.
state
of
material
fact
then
such
proxies
shall
be
declared
void
as
is
provided
in
section
29.
and
the
agreement
for
merger
and
the
merger
consummated
thereby
shall
likewise
be
declared
void.
all
he's
got
to
show,
there
was
a
mistake
inadvertent
or
not,
that
somebody
now
is
convinced
with
the
material.
next,
in
the
event
of
such
finding
as
set
forth
in
the
above,
the
court
shall
be
empowered
after
due
hearing
to
award
money
damages
against
the
corporations
concerned,
its
defendant
directors
or
other
defendant
persons
payable
to
the
plaintiff.
and
to
such
other
member
of
his
class
as
the
court
may
attach
and
shall
impose
cost
as
the
court
may
deem
equitable.
next,
the
court
may
also
there
require
the
corporation
to
issue
a
new
or
additional
security
--
that's
--
asked
for
by
the
sec
here
to
the
plaintiff
and
to
members
of
his
class
as
the
court
may
deem
just.and
in
general,
now
i'm
quoting,
"the
court
may
make
such
other
readjustments
of
the
terms
of
the
merger
as
the
court
may
determine
to
be
just
and
equitable."
now,
as
they
say,
when
we
get
through
with
all
that
and
it's
reopened
and
this
is
before
the
trial
judge
in
milwaukee,
perhaps
who
was
not
in
that
--
he
passed
then
to
familiar
in
the
financial
field,
he's
going
wrestle
with
the
relief.
i
think
that
if
the
sec
wants
amendments
like
that,
but
they
shouldn't
ask
the
court
to
put
it
in
by
implication.
they
should
go
to
congress
and
say,
"let's
have
an
amendment
that
will
throw
out
securities
for
cost
or
throw
out
the
appraisal
business,
throw
out
all
these
things
that
the
state
court
have
setup,
all
the
remedies
that
they
put
in
and
let's
give
everybody
a
free
ride
to
do
it
and
we'll
have
a
great
cluster
of
strike
cases
but
we
think
that's
good."
personally,
i
think
it's
bad.
i
don't
think
to
make
strike
cases
easy
and
let
everybody
attack
every
merger
and
there
will
be
an
attack
i
would
predict
if
the
court
does
it
by
implication
on
every
merger
that
comes
through.
strike
cases
are
something
like
homosexuality.
ordinarily
you're
not
supposed
to
refer
to
them.
but
there
are
growing
vice
now.
we
have
three
in
our
office
now.
if
we
--
so
that
everybody
come
in
and
attack
every
merger
that's
claiming
there
was
something
of
series
omitted
in
the
proxy
statement
of
a
material
nature
and
he's
got
full
scope
of
a
free
attack
on
mergers,
where
are
we
going
to
be
with
it.
are
we
going
to
get
to
a
point
where
we
can't
have
a
merger
completed
and
put
away
without
having
some
kind
of
a
--
developing
some
kind
of
an
in
rem
proceeding
like
you
have
an
action
acquired
title
about
real
estates?
do
we
have
to
wait
for
the
state
court
here
state
statute?
we
have
six
years
of
limitation.
in
the
state
statute
in
wisconsin
on
some
things
for
fraud,
is
there
a
federal
statute?
i
would
like
to
hear
and
i'm
going
to
listen
attentively
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
they
are
asking
the
court
to
write
in
here?
which
one
is
it?
is
it
federal?
is
it
state?
if
we're
going
to
write
the
state,
well
then
why
don't
we
read
it
in
the
rest
of
the
state
law
or
is
it
all
out?
is
there
no
statute
of
limitations
to
attack
mergers?
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
suggest
if
the
sec
wants
the
law
modified
in
this
elaborate
way,
they
should
take
it
to
congress
but
i
would
also
suggest
not
to
be
over
optimistic
that
the
congressional
committee
would
go
that
far.
thank
you.
