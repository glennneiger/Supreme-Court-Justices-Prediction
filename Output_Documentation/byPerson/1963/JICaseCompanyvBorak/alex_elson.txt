mr.
alex
elson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
and
properly
before
this
court
is
the
scope
of
relief
which
a
federal
court
may
grant
an
action
brought
under
section
27
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
for
violations
of
section
14
(a).
counsel
yesterday
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
facts
in
this
case
was
set
forth
in
the
complaint
and
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
should
be
assumed
to
be
true.
however,
those
facts
were
not
given
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issues
before
this
court
should
be
considered
in
the
context
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
counsel
has
stated,
the
original
complaint
here
have
two
counts.
the
first
count
is
not
before
this
court.
no
appeal
haven't
been
taken
from
the
court
of
appeals
reversing
the
district
court
as
to
that
count.
as
to
count
2,
count
2
incorporates
a
substantial
part
of
count
1.
briefly,
the
facts
which
come
out
from
the
complaint
as
a
whole,
the
plaintiff
here
owns
and
has
held
for
many
years
some
2000
shares
of
a
common
stock
of
the
case
company.
the
action
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
shareholders
of
case
similarly
situated.
it
was
brought
to
vindicate
the
preemptive
rights
of
those
shareholders.
the
jurisdiction
is
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
and
--
and
also
on
federal
question
jurisdiction
both
under
sections
1331
and
1337
of
judicial
code,
as
well
as
on
--
on
section
20
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
the
facts
are
that
on
october
15th
of
1956,
the
petitioners
solicited
proxies
of
case
stockholders
for
use
at
a
stockholders'
meeting
to
be
held
in
november
15th,
1956.
at
which
time
an
oath
was
to
be
taken
on
proposed
merger
with
the
american
tractor
company
which
i'll
hereafter
refer
to
as
atc.
the
proxy
solicitation
material
was
false
and
misleading
in
a
material
way.
it
was
in
violation
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
rule
1489
thereunder.
the
merger
was
approved
by
small
margin
of
votes
and
wisconsin
made
it
shortly
thereafter.
the
merger
would
not
have
been
approved
but
for
the
materially
false
and
misleading
statements
or
omissions
in
the
proxy
solicitation
material.
i'm
just
going
to
discuss
a
few
of
the
false
and
misleading
aspects
in
this
proxy
material.
the
first
relates
to
the
manner
of
manipulation
of
the
price
--
market
pricings
of
american
tractor
company
stock.
the
stock
market
price
of
atc
was
used
to
their
basis
for
justifying
the
exchange.
this
market
price
was
--
was
the
result
of
manipulation
in
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
regulations
issued
thereunder.
manipulation
goes
back
to
1954.
it
began
with
the
acquisition
of
a
block
of
170,000
shares
of
atc
stock
at
51
cents
a
share
by
edward
l.
eliot.
he
was
the
defendant
in
this
case
who
died
on
the
course
of
the
proceedings
and
for
whom
his
executor
has
been
substituted.
eliot
bypassed
the
registration
requirements
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
he
made
a
misleading
offering
circular.
he
filed
a
misleading
offering
a
circular
with
the
commission,
and
sold
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sold
all
his
shares
even
prior
to
the
filing
or
approval
of
that
circular.
with
a
small
amount
of
stock
in
the
hands
of
the
public,
trading
was
relatively
light,
prices
changed
narrowly
under
--
changed
rather
fluctuated
widely
on
narrow
trading
with
the
aid
of
stock
splits,
with
the
aid
of
special
manipulative
tactics.
the
stock
rose
to
a
high
of
$15
even
though
at
all
times,
atc
was
in
very
bad
financial
condition,
never
paid
any
dividends,
and
during
most
of
the
years
of
its
business,
suffered
losses.
now,
the
negotiators
on
both
sides
of
this
transaction,
both
for
case
and
for
atc,
who
were
named
as
defendants
in
this
case,
knew
prior
to
the
merger
that
the
market
price
of
atc
was
achieved
both
illegally
and
artificially.
since
the
merger,
there's
been
a
conviction
on
the
plea
of
guilty
by
the
new
york
broker
for
unlawful
manipulation
of
atc
stock
during
the
period
from
may,
1955
to
february,
1956
which
was
almost
a
year
prior
to
the
merger
in
this
case.
the
securities
exchange
commission
in
a
preliminary
report
for
the
--
made
with
relation
to
the
american
stock
exchange
was
filed
recently
in
january
of
1962,
noted
that
gilligan,
will
&
company,
a
specialist
in
the
american
stock
exchange
for
the
atc
common
stock,
acquired
the
stock
prior
to
the
listing
of
atc
stock
on
the
exchange
and
otherwise,
engaged
in
various
other
improper
and
illegal
activities
with
respect
to
atc
stock.
eliot,
during
the
course
of
his
deposition,
admitted
that
he
knew
there
had
been
manipulation
of
atc
stock.
eliot,
and
this
is
in
the
record,
was
also
a
close
friend
and
an
associate
of
members
of
the
firm
of
gilligan,
will
&
company,
so
much
for
the
manipulative
aspects.
secondly,
i
come
to
self
dealing
and
this
self
dealing
is
very
carefully
concealed
in
this
--
in
this
proxy
statement.
this
self
dealing
included
first
of
all
the
promotion
of
a
merger
by
the
management
group
in
order
to
perpetuate
themselves
in
office
by
shifting
the
voting
control
of
the
case
to
certain
defendants.
second,
the
promotion
of
a
plan
--
mr.
alex
elson
your,
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
alex
elson
i'm
going
on
the
basis
that
since
the
only
--
that
this
comes
up
on
motion
as
counsel
for
petitioners
stated
yesterday.
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
amended
complaint
must
be
assumed
to
be
true
for
purposes
of
this
hearing.
that
had
--
there
had
been
no
findings.
mr.
alex
elson
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alex
elson
that's
correct.
the
second
aspect
of
self
dealing
was
a
promotion
of
a
plan
by
certain
defendants
in
order
to
obtain
a
market
for
their
large
holdings
of
american
tractor
company's
stock.
this
was
accomplished
by
obtaining
the
full
current
stock
market
price
of
at
stock
--
atc
stock.
the
third
was
the
securing
of
valuable
stock
options
for
several
of
the
defendants
as
one,
the
terms
of
the
merger.
and
finally,
the
securing
by
one
of
the
negotiators
for
case
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee
who
was
responsible
for
the
actual
making
of
the
transaction
of
a
substantial
amount
of
business
for
his
own
company,
a
supplier
of
case.
third
aspect
of
this
proxy
statement
which
is
significant
and
which
was
not
revealed
was
the
excessive
price
which
was
paid
for
case,
grossly
excessive
price,
a
sum
of
$70
million
for
a
company
with
assets
of
worth
approximately
a
million.
case
gave
an
exchange
for
each
share
of
atc
stock,
a
half
share
of
case
common
and
one
share
of
$7,
6.5%
preferred
stock.
on
the
basis
of
this
exchange
--
of
this
price,
the
price
paid
was
218
times
the
average
earnings
for
atc
during
the
years
1952
and
192
--
1956.
it
was
more
than
50
times
the
--
the
earnings
for
the
best
year
of
atc.
the
book
value
of
--
of
case
was
$36
a
share
at
the
time
where
atc
was
$1
and
15
cents.
you
had
a
ratio
here
of
17:1.
finally,
the
proxy
statement
failed
to
disclose
the
capital
requirements
and
the
competitive
factors
which
were
involved
in
entering
the
road
building
and
heavy
construction
business
which
was
one
of
the
prime
justifications
offered
by
the
management
for
the
merger.
these
factors
were
in
important
way
responsible
for
the
serious
financial
problems
which
later
confronted
case.
by
december
of
1961,
its
indebtedness
had
increased
to
$162
million.
at
a
series
of
years
of
very
severe
losses
and
were
it
not
for
the
agreement
of
a
group
of
banks
to
extend
this
indebtedness
and
increased
it
substantially,
case
would
have
been
in
bankruptcy
or
reorganization.
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
there
was
$42
million
in
the
treasury
of
case
company.
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
1961,
they
had
all
been
virtually
used
up.
mr.
alex
elson
that's
right,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
alex
elson
well,
it
was
my
thought,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
court
should
have
before
it
at
least
the
factual
context
to
--
to
consider
the
legal
issues
and
i'm
coming
to
them
very
shortly.
the
complaint
asked
the
court
to
declare
the
proxy
solicitation
materially
false
and
misleading.
the
proxy
solicited
illegal
and
that
the
merger
and
all
agreements
entered
pursuant
thereto
are
void.
damages
are
requested
for
the
injury
sustained
by
the
plaintiff
and
all
other
stockholders,
similarly
situated
and
such
other
in
further
relief
as
equity
shall
require.
now,
i
come
to
the
--
back
to
the
issue.
i
think
that
the
defendants
here
have
--
petitioners
have
wavered
considerably
in
deciding
what
the
issue
was
and
what
relief
they
believe
the
federal
court
could
give.
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
14
(a)
that
limited
relief
to
declaratory
relief.
in
fact
that
it
--
it
said
the
week
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
--
could
get
a
--
were
--
could
--
could
obtain
of
the
facts
warranted.
a
declaration
that
the
proxy
statement
was
false
and
misleading,
that
the
proxies
were
illegally
employed
and
that
the
merger
and
the
agreements
made
pursuant
thereto
were
void.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioners
and
--
and
i
might
say
that
the
petitioners
rep
--
were
represented
by
the
same
counsel
in
this
case
all
the
way
through
until
after
the
grant
of
certiorari.
and
for
the
first
time,
case
corporation
had
separate
counsel
after
the
petition
for
a
cert
--
certiorari
was
granted.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioners
asked
for
an
affirmance
of
the
district
court
order
and
argued
that
relief
be
limited
to
declaratory
relief.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
stated
the
issues
at
--
as
i
see
it
solely
in
terms
of
the
scope
of
relief
and
in
part,
they
relied
on
the
conflict
between
the
dann
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below.
now,
in
the
case
--
in
the
briefs
filed
in
this
court,
in
the
first
brief
filed
by
case
company,
case
claimed
that
relief
was
limited
to
the
relief
--
relief
that
could
be
given
was
limited
to
injunction
departing
from
the
district
court
ruling,
the
declaratory
relief
could
also
be
given.
nevertheless,
the
brief
concludes
with
a
request,
the
district
court
order
be
reinstated
to
give
declaratory
relief.
individual
briefs
similarly
state
the
issue
as
though
only
the
scope
of
relief
is
involved.
now,
in
the
reply
brief
when
--
when
the
--
for
the
--
only
one
reply
brief
was
filed
and
this
was
for
the
company
and
in
oral
argument,
as
i
understand
mr.
whyte's
argument,
case
company
in
fact
reverses
itself.
and
without
having
taken
a
cross
appeal
from
the
district
court's
judgment,
asked
this
court
to
reverse
that
this
--
not
only
the
court
of
appeals
but
also
the
district
court
because
it
asked
in
its
conclusion
that
all
of
count
2
be
stricken
in
its
entirety.
i
might
say
that
that
position
of
course
is
--
at
variance
with
the
position
expressed
by
mr.
davis
speaking
for
the
individual
petitioners.
he
acknowledged
that
he
believed
that
there
wasn't
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
14
(a)
but
that
relief
should
be
limited
to
declaratory
relief.
as
i
understand
the
company's
position
now,
it
is
that
there
is
no
remedy
under
section
27
for
violations
of
section
14
(a)
and
that
count
2
should
be
stricken
in
its
entirety.
i
might
say
that
the
reply
brief
does
not
discuss
or
answer
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
and
the
commission
in
their
briefs.
i
submit
that
the
change
of
position
of
the
case
company
was
due
to
the
realization
that
once
the
implied
remedy
--
the
existence
of
the
implied
remedy
has
conceded,
there
is
no
sound
basis
for
drawing
a
line
as
to
relief
given.
the
relief
must
rest
on
the
discretion
of
the
court.
it
does
not
--
there's
no
issue
of
jurisdiction
involved.
now,
in
taking
the
position
that
the
case
company
now
takes
and
of
course
it
has
departed
from
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
and
also
it
--
it's
confronted
with
the
rule
that
no
cross
appeal
having
been
taken.
it
may
not
ask
for
a
modification
of
the
district
court
order
which
is
more
favorable
to
it
or
less
favorable
to
the
respondents.
this
rule
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
cardozo,
very
succinctly
in
the
morley
construction
company
case
which
he
says,
"the
rule
isn't
better
and
uncertain
in
the
absence
of
cross
appeal,
appellee
may
not
attack
a
decree
with
a
view
of
enlarging
his
own
rights
thereunder
or
lessening
the
rights
of
his
adversary."
now,
we'll
put
these
questions
aside
and
meet
the
issue
framed
by
the
petitioners
head
on.
petitioners
make
in
the
reply
brief
two
arguments
to
which
i
should
make
brief
reference
for
the
purpose
only
of
indicating
the
full
scope
of
the
petitioner's
position.
the
first
is
that
the
--
the
application
of
the
expressio
unius
principles
since
it
--
as
it
--
that
the
argument
being
and
since
there
are
three
sections
in
which
there
are
expressed
remedies
hence
it
follows
that
there
cannot
be
any
implied
remedies.
the
second
is
the
claim
that
section
27
of
the
act
is
a
limited
and
not
a
general
ground
of
jurisdiction.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
the
expressio
unius
argument
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
this
--
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
sec
versus
c.
m.
joiner
leasing
corporation
case
which
is
discussed
at
our
brief
at
page
34.
and
this
court
construed
section
22
(a)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
which
is
almost
identical
in
wording
to
section
27
as
a
general
ground
of
jurisdiction
in
the
deckert
case
to
which
we
refer
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
the
arguments
--
these
two
arguments
of
the
petitioner
would
also
compel
the
conclusion
that
no
remedy
is
created
under
section
27
for
violation
of
other
sections
of
the
act
including
sections
10
(b),
the
--
the
antifraud
section,
section
6
(b)
requiring
stock
exchanges
to
adapt
disciplinary
procedures,
section
7,
margin
requirement
provisions,
section
29
(b)
which
authorizes
the
voiding
of
contracts
in
violation
of
the
act.
and
moreover,
it
would
prevent
the
securities
exchange
commission
itself
from
seeking
relief
under
section
27
which
was
not
specifically
provided
for
in
the
act.
in
effect,
what
this
court
is
being
asked
by
the
petitioner
case
to
do,
is
to
overturn
a
substantial
body
of
law
developed
over
20
years
recognizing
and
implementing
implied
remedies
under
securities
exchange
act,
important
part
of
the
federal
securities
regulation
of
this
country.
actions
have
been
implied
on
behalf
of
the
shareholders.
under
section
27
for
violations
of
various
provisions
of
the
act
by
the
courts
of
appeal
from
the
sixth
circuits
then
rejected
by
none
insofar
as
shareholders
are
concerned,
the
howard
versus
first
case
being
a
case
involved
in
the
derivative
action.
in
many
of
those
cases,
certiorari
was
applied
for
and
denied.
and
many
--
many
of
those
cases
have
been
cited
by
this
court
in
other
--
in
context
of
other
statutes
where
the
question
of
implied
remedies
have
--
have
come
up.
now,
so
far
as
section
14
(a)
is
concerned,
the
actions
have
been
implied
by
the
sixth
and
seventh
court
--
courts
of
appeal
and
as
to
derivative
actions
by
the
third
court
of
appeals.
as
to
violations
of
section
10
(b),
there
had
been
decisions
by
the
second,
third,
fifth,
and
sixth,
and
ninth
circuits.
as
to
violations
of
section
6
(b),
7
(c),
and
29
(b),
remedies
of
an
implied
both
by
the
federal
courts
of
appeal
and
district
courts.
and
remedies
have
been
implied
for
the
securities
exchange
commission
itself
under
section
14
(a)
for
violations
of
the
--
under
--
under
section
27
for
violation
of
section
14
(a)
to
the
third
and
ninth
circuits.
now,
this
well-established
body
of
law
is
grounded
on
sound
analysis
with
the
securities
exchange
act
and
upon
principles
long
articulated
by
this
court.
the
general
rule
which
has
been
articulated
by
this
court
many
times
is
that
where
you
have
a
statute
which
is
designed
to
protect
a
class
of
persons.
and
one
of
that
class
of
persons
is
injured,
the
right
of
such
person
to
sue
to
remedy
the
--
that
injury
will
be
implied.
this
was
the
basic
of
the
holding
and
the
steel
and
transtar
cases,
and
in
numerous
other
cases
which
this
court
is
familiar
with.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
dealing
as
we
do
with
the
securities
exchange
act,
we
have
language
in
that
act
which
buttresses
this
special
principle.
this
is
a
remedial
statute.
the
act
itself,
section
2,
declares
and
i'm
quoting,
"transactions
and
securities
as
commonly
conducted
upon
securities
exchanges
and
over
the
counter
markets
are
affected
with
the
national
public
interest
which
makes
it
necessary
to
provide
for
regulation
and
control
of
such
transactions
and
the
practices
and
matters
related
thereto.
and
section
2
also
declares
and
this
is
important,
that
one
of
its
purposes
is
to
make,
"regulation
and
control
of
security
transactions
reasonably
complete
and
effective."
now,
under
a
broadly
based
regulatory
statute
such
as
a
securities
exchange
act,
there
are
many
reasons
for
implying
a
remedy.
this
includes
the
following.
first,
the
fact
that
the
act
and
particularly
the
proxy
that
provisions
are
designed
to
protect
shareholders
and
publicly
held
corporations
as
a
class.
the
remedial
purpose
of
section
14
(a)
was
referred
to
in
the
--
in
the
legislative
history
as
being
to
control
the
conditions
under
which
proxies
maybe
solicited,
prevent
the
recurrence
of
abuses
which
frustrated
the
voting
rights
of
shareholders."
as
stated
in
a
--
i
think
one
of
the
most
definitive
decisions
discussing
section
10
(b)
in
this
case
by
mr.
--
by
chief
judge
biggs
of
the
second
circuit,
the
case
of
mcclure
versus
borne
chemical
company.
the
act
creates
a
new
federal
law
of
management
stockholder
relationships
and
provides
stockholders
with
a
potent
weapon
for
enforcement
of
many
fiduciary
duties.
in
that
case,
i
might
say
incidentally
that
the
court
held
that
the
state
security
for
statute
--
for
expense
statute
was
inapplicable
to
an
action
brought
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
the
second
reason
for
implying
the
cause
of
action
as
well
as
providing
complete
relief
is
the
essential
need
for
private
actions
when
the
task
of
securing
compliance
is
of
great
magnitude.
the
private
action
secures
additional
compliance
and
its
existence
also
acts
as
a
deterrent
to
noncompliance.
as
the
commission
brief
points
out,
in
this
case,
with
relation
to
the
matter
of
manipulation.
the
commission
would
not
have
been
--
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
the
commission
in
the
short
time
that
it
had
to
examine
this
proxy
statement,
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
price
of
atc
stock
had
been
artificially
maintained
--
legally
maintained.
the
third
reason
for
implying
the
remedy
is
the
need
--
the
need
exists
where
the
regulation
creates
new
duties
which
are
unknown
or
rare
in
the
states.
now,
i
might
say
in
passing
that
with
reference
to
the
point
made
by
mr.
whyte,
there
are
very
few
states
that
have
statutes
of
this
character.
for
the
fact
that
public
utility
the
--
that
corporate
transactions
are
interstate
in
character,
requires
you
to
form
remedies.
you
--
in
--
in
most
of
these
cases,
you
have
numerous
individuals
involved.
they
reside
in
various
states.
there
is
need
for
clear
provisions
as
to
venue.
there
is
need
for
securing
service
over
them
which
would
be
impossible
if
these
matters
were
relegated
to
the
states.
there
also,
it's
the
practical
problems
which
we
point
out
in
much
greater
detail
in
our
brief
and
i
refer
the
court
to
that.
finally
there's
--
these
various
--
the
absence
of
any
formal
administrative
procedure
under
the
act
for
shareholders.
there's
no
way
in
which
shareholders
maybe
heard
with
relation
to
the
violation
of
their
rights.
in
addition
to
these
facts,
you
--
you
--
we
do
have
a
recognition
by
congress
of
the
implied
remedy
with
relation
to
section
29
(b)
of
the
act.
that
act
was
amended
in
1938
and
congress,
by
the
amendment,
excluded
certain
contracts
from
being
considered
void
in
actions
brought
under
section
29
(a)
recognizing
that
actions
could
be
brought
under
that
section.
and
i
might
say
that
the
lower
court
here
held
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction
to
declare
these
contracts
invalid
under
section
29
(b).
there
should
be
out
of
the
consideration
that
the
--
that
the
commission
itself,
the
agency
which
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
act
should
not
be
denied
remedies
essential
to
its
task,
a
result
which
would
follow
the
arguments
of
the
case
corporation
itself.
the
reports,
for
example,
have
it
--
to
request
the
commission
appointed
receivers
of
the
1934
act
or
this
particular
form
of
relief
is
not
expressed
and
provided
for
in
the
act.
now,
all
of
the
considerations
which
i
haven't
--
had
listed
which
compelled
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action,
also
sustained
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
jurisdiction
extends
to
grant
whatever
relief
the
merits
of
the
controversy
may
require
and
requires
a
rejection
of
the
--
it's
better,
a
piecemeal
litigation
approach
which
was
--
which
was
the
approach
of
the
dann
case.
any
--
in
fact
except
for
dann,
no
court
has
ever
--
do
not
have
the
right
to
--
a
plaintiff
to
appropriate
relief
has
never
been
denied
by
any
court.
there's
never
been
any
question
raised
as
to
the
scope
of
relief
except
for
that
one
case.
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
holding
is
sourly
based
under
broad
grant
of
jurisdiction
in
section
27.
i
won't'
take
time
to
read
that
section,
i
think
the
cursory
reading
will
indicate
its
breath.
i
think
the
court's
holding
is
--
is
based
certainly
on
use
--
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to
bell
versus
hood.
i
think
is
on
the
sound
ground.
in
that
case
the
court
stated,
"that's
been
the
rule
from
the
beginning."
there
were
federally
protected
rights
have
been
invaded,
courts
will
be
alert
to
adjust
their
remedies
so
as
to
grant
the
necessary
relief.
mr.
alex
elson
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
alex
elson
well
the
--
the
howard
versus
first
case,
i
should
say
it
first,
tried
out
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
action
brought
in
behalf
of
shareholders
that
was
--
could
be
brought
under
section
14.
it
states
expressly
--
so
it
does
not
pass
on
that
question.
it
does
pass
on
the
question
of
the
derivative
aspect.
i
don't
see
--
i
--
i
don't'
follow
the
logic
of
that
case
and
i
don't
see
why
if
a
corporation
is
damaged,
it
should
not
have
the
same
rights
as
the
individuals
to
secure
relief
under
section
14
(a).
the
case
has
been
severely
criticized.
in
fact
in
one
recent
opinion
prior
to
his
death,
would
--
surely
before
his
death,
the
late
judge
clark
said
he
thought
that
the
case
should've
been
overruled.
and
in
fact,
overturned
is
the
word
he
used.
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
at
some
point
--
mr.
alex
elson
well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there
aren't
situations
that
there
are
--
mr.
alex
elson
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
alex
elson
that
--
that's
--
but
there
--
there
may
be
situations,
your
honor,
where
the
corporation
--
where
you
have
a
management
group
that
takes
action
or
a
particular
group
within
the
management
--
which
maybe
very
prejudicial
to
the
corporation.
mr.
alex
elson
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
alex
elson
well,
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
vindication
of
preemptive
rights
was
a
right,
personal
to
shareholders
in
count
1.
count
2
similarly
asked
for
the
vindication
of
--
of
personal
rights.
we
--
we
say
also,
that
--
that
in
addition
to
that,
that
this
is
a
federally
based
action.and
as
such,
the
application
of
the
state
statute
would
not
apply.
i
--
mr.
alex
elson
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
--
mr.
alex
elson
mr.
justice
stewart
but
that
--
but
what
was
injured
in
the
process
was
the
right
of
the
shareholders,
the
--
their
preemptive
rights
stopped
because
stock
was
being
issued
here
in
violation
of
the
preemptive
rights.
mr.
alex
elson
well,
if
--
if
there
is
a
recovery
of
--
of
damages,
the
court
will
of
course
have
to
determine
that
--
when
we
--
i
--
i
would
assume
that
the
--
that
there'd
be
a
fund
created
and
which
will
be
distributed
by
direction
of
the
court
to
the
shareholders.
mr.
alex
elson
i
do
not
believe
so.
we're
not
asking
of
the
turnover
to
the
corporation.
this
is
a
--
an
individual
action.
and
there
--
if
--
if
you
--
if
the
--
if
the
entire
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
read
in
context
or
appear
that
this
is
a
--
a
--
an
action
brought
in
behalf
of
the
shareholders.
now,
i
realized
that
the
commission
has
said
that
that
in
its
opinion,
you
look
at
the
damages
that
are
being
asked.
there
are
two
ways
of
determining,
you
look
either
--
you
can
either
look
at
the
injury
that
the
--
to
the
group
--
to
--
to
the
quality
of
the
injury
complained
of
or
to
the
damages.
now,
we
do
not
ask
for
a
rescission.
and
so
this
is
a
state
and
i
want
to
correctly
--
we
ask
that
the
merger
be
declared
void
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
the
court
will
rescind
or
needs
to
rescind
whatever
relief
would
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstance,
the
court
can
give.
the
court
may
--
mr.
alex
elson
not
automatically,
mr.
justice
white.
i
suppose
the
court
would
still
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
it
should
declare
them
or
not.
mr.
alex
elson
i
think
that
would
be
a
part
of
our
case.
although,
i
would
assume
that
it
--
we
show
that
this
--
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
merger
is
approved
by
a
close
margin
and
we
show
that
the
proxy
statement
was
in
fact
false
and
misleading,
it
would
follow
that
the
merger
would
be
set
aside.
