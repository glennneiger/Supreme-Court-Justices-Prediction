mr.
walter
s.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
this
action
was
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
respondent's
complaint
on
november
13,
1956.
in
that
complaint
and
with
an
attendant
order
to
show
cause,
the
plaintiff
respondent
sought
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
corporation
and
that
--
and
the
then
five
individual
defendant
directors
from
taking
further
action
to
or
towards
the
consummation
of
a
merger
of
the
american
tractor
corporation
into
j.
i.
case
company.
he
also
sought
to
have
any
merger
declared
void.
the
application
for
the
temporary
injunction
was
denied
by
the
trial
court,
namely
dis
--
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
and
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
denial.
the
defendants
at
that
point,
petitioners
before
this
court,
sought
to
have
this
case
moved
ahead
for
trial.
the
respondent
resisted
having
the
case
brought
on,
pleading
that
he
had
to
engage
in
discovery.
and
that
if
any
damages
were
inflicted
upon
the
company
by
delaying
the
consummation
of
the
merger,
that
those
damages
would
be
self-inflicted.
accordingly,
the
corporation
proceeded
to
consummate
the
merger
of
atc
into
the
j.
i.
case
company.
now,
the
respondent,
it
proceed
with
extensive
discovery,
and
eventually
filed
a
--
an
amended
and
supplemental
complaint.
the
trial
court
at
that
point,
upon
motion
of
the
de
--
defendant
--
the
corporate
defendant,
j.
i.
case
company,
ordered
that
the
respondent
post
$75,000
as
security
for
expenses,
as
a
condition
to
the
proceeding
with
the
lawsuit.
what
the
trial
court
did
was
apply
the
statute
of
wisconsin,
a
security
for
expense
statute
which
was
considered
at
length
by
this
court
in
cohen
versus
the
beneficial
industrial
loan
corporation
in
337
u.s.
the
respondent
did
not
post
the
security.
the
--
the
orders
gave
him
alternatives
to
join
other
plaintiffs,
do
other
things,
and
the
matter
laid
at
rest
at
that
point
until
the
respondent
filed
a
second
amended
and
supplemental
complaint
and
then
a
third
amended
and
supplemental
complaint
which
he
filed
with
the
consent
of
the
court
on
the
representation
that
he
would
turn
the
action
into
one
to
solely
vindicate
his
preemptive
rights.
in
other
words,
that
he
would
turn
the
case
from
a
derivative
lawsuit
to
which
the
statute,
the
wisconsin
statute
applies,
he
would
turn
it
from
a
derivative
lawsuit
into
a
primary
claim
of
the
stockholder.
now,
it
will
be
noted
that
the
third
amended
complaint
which
is
before
this
court
in
--
at
this
time
is
before
the
court
almost
as
if
there
had
been
a
demurrer
to
the
complaint.
no
answer
has
been
filed
to
this
complaint.
there
has
been
no
testimony,
no
evidence,
there's
been
no
findings.
we
take
this
complaint
as
a
verity
for
the
purposes
of
--
of
this
discussion.
the
complaint
is
in
two
counts
-
count
one
is
a
count
which
alleges
a
violation
of
the
stockholders
of
the
case
company's
preemptive
rights.
the
trial
court,
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
reviewed
that
count
one,
said
that
the
amendment
was
insufficient
to
disguise
it
or
turn
it
from
a
derivative
cause
of
action
and
ordered
the
respondent
to
post
security
for
a
cost.
this
ruling
on
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit
was
overturned
and
we
may
move
count
one
aside
for
the
purposes
of
discussion
before
this
court
because
no
appeal
was
taken
or
no
question
was
raised
about
the
seventh
circuit
reversing
the
trial
court
on
count
one.
count
two
on
the
other
hand
attempts
to
touch
a
federal
question
and
that
is
the
face
of
the
case
that
is
here
on
certiorari
today.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
no
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
that
point
two
in
our
brief
was
raised
on
the
petition.
it
is
fairly
comprised
within
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
petition
and
in
fact
it
is
the
heart
of
what
this
case
is
all
about,
point
two.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
we
do,
your
honor,
but
we
--
in
the
--
mr.
walter
s.
davis
i
believe
that
the
reply
be
--
brief
filed
by
the
corporate
--
petitioner,
j.
i.
case
company
answers
that
point
and
specifically
points
out
where
we
made
the
references
in
the
petition.
i
will
--
mr.
walter
s.
davis
we
--
mr.
walter
s.
davis
mr.
justice
goldberg,
our
position
has
been
that
we
tried
to
whittle
down
this
petition
so
that
we
said
as
little
as
was
necessary
to
fairly
present
to
the
court
everything
that
was
involved
in
our
claim.
and
that
has
been
our
position
that
the
question
of
--
of
what
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
count
two
states,
also
carries
with
it
the
question
of
--
as
what
are
the
limits
of
that
case
and
whether
it
is
strictly
a
federal
question
or
not.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
closed
yesterday
afternoon,
the
question
had
arisen
as
to
whether
we've
--
had
attempted
as
our
opposing
counsel
has
suggested
to
sneak
a
question
in
on
this
petition
for
the
writ.
i
would
refer
to
the
--
the
corporate
--
petitioner's
reply
brief,
pages
10
through
15
which
i
reread
last
night.
i
think
it
is
a
complete
answer
to
the
assertion
and
i
--
i
subscribed
to
it.
as
i
proceed
with
my
argument
and
get
to
the
statement
of
the
question
presented
here,
i
think
it
will
become
obvious
why
the
applicability
of
the
state
statute
pertaining
to
security
for
expenses
is
inextricably
entwined
in
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
on
this
grant
of
the
petition.
now,
as
i
had
said
yesterday,
count
1
of
the
complaint
is
not
before
the
court.
count
2,
which
our
trial
court,
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
is
before
the
court.
count
2
was
held
by
the
trial
court
to
sufficiently
state
a
federal
question
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
validity
of
proxies.
our
trial
court
held
that
the
reference
to
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
was
sufficient
to
give
it
jurisdiction
to
give
if
requested
a
declaratory
relief
pertaining
to
the
proxies
that
were
solicited
for
the
stockholders'
meeting
authorizing
the
merger.
with
respect
to
the
balance
of
the
claim
of
count
2
and
--
and
here
is
the
important
distinction
with
respect
to
the
claim
for
rescission
and
damages,
our
trial
court
said
that
that
did
not
lie
within
federal
law,
that
that
claim
was
essentially
a
state
claim,
a
claim
for
a
common
law,
de
--
derivative
type
relief.
and
accordingly,
since
it
was
a
state
case
of
the
state
security
for
expense
statute
applied.
upon
the
respondent's
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit,
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
they
reversed
the
holding
of
count
1
and
that
is
not
before
the
court.
but
as
to
count
2,
the
circuit
court
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
claimed
violation
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
was
sufficient
to
make
the
cause
of
action
uniquely
grounded
in
the
federal
law.
the
court
further
held
that
howard
versus
first,
a
decision
in
the
second
circuit
was
wrong.the
opinion
cites
howard
versus
first,
as
being
contrary
to
its
own.
the
seventh
circuit
also
held
that
dann
versus
studebaker
corporation
in
the
sixth
circuit
was
unnecessarily
limited
and
would
not
be
the
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
accordingly,
upon
our
petition,
the
--
this
court
granted
the
writ
for
certiorari
to
review
the
question
as
stated
in
the
petition
whether
section
27
of
the
act
grants
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
rescission
or
damages
to
a
corporate
stockholder
in
respect
of
a
consummated
merger
which
was
authorized
pursuant
to
the
use
of
a
proxy
statement,
alleged
to
have
contained
misleading
statements
violative
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
act.
i
would
like
to
make
about
three
points
to
the
court
if
i
may
before
i
turn
this
(inaudible)
over
to
mr.
whyte
who
is
representing
the
corporate
petitioner.
first
of
all,
we
would
start
with
what
we
believe
is
a
general
agreement
among
all
party
here
--
all
parties
here.
the
petitioners,
corporate
and
individual,
are
of
the
view
that
count
2
of
this
complaint
states
a
derivative
cause
of
action.
that
is
an
action
that
is
brought
in
the
right
of
the
corporation,
that
it's
really
the
corporation's
cause
of
action
that
the
corporation
is
not
enforcing,
so
a
stockholder
has
appointed
himself
as
champion
of
the
stockholders
and
is
bringing
it
for
the
corporation.
the
securities
exchange
commission,
amicus
before
this
court
at
pages
16
and
17
of
their
brief,
i
believe
agree
with
us.
where
at
the
top
of
page
17
of
their
brief,
they
state,
"we
do
not
dispute
the
characterization
of
the
action
as
derivative
at
least
insofar
as
it
seeks
damages
and
rescission."
and
that
certainly
is
in
accord
with
our
view
of
the
case.
the
respondent,
carl
borak,
the
stockholder,
has
not
conceived
that
it
is
derivative
except
for
the
purposes
of
extended
argument.
i
certainly
not
going
to
accuse
counsel
of
having
a
--
reached
an
agreement
with
us
but
i
think
it
is
significant
that
counsel
recognizes
that
this
is
an
important
point
and
an
important
feature
of
the
entire
case
because
they
very
readily
assumed
and
admit
that
count
2
maybe
derivative
for
the
purposes
of
extended
argument.
now,
our
position
is
this,
that
if
count
2
is
derivative
then
under
the
rule
of
howard
versus
first,
we
must
look
to
the
statutory
history
of
the
securities
exchange
act
and
determine
whether
the
securities
exchange
act
is
intended
to
create
any
substantive
rights
in
a
corporate
issuer.
the
second
circuit
in
going
through
this,
processed
--
found
there
was
no
such
legislative
history.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
was
to
the
contrary.
the
general
statement
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
that
as
far
as
proxy
solicitation
is
concerned,
the
purpose
is
to
bring
about
the
broad
public
need
for
full
disclosure
and
as
the
second
circuit
related
in
its
opinion,
this
is
a
not
a
right
--
a
substantive
right
in
the
corporate
issuer
who
ordinarily
issues
the
proxy
statements.
and
that
the
securities
exchange
act
was
to
protect
investors
and
not
the
corporate
issuers.
other
cases,
the
brout
(ph)
case
which
we
have
cited
goes
--
traces
much
of
the
same
history
and
reaches,
in
general,
the
same
conclusion.
now,
this
being
the
case,
the
second
circuit,
finding
no
legislative
history
to
support
a
right
in
the
corporation,
held
that
in
a
derivative
action,
a
federal
cause
of
action
was
not
stated
by
the
mere
reference
to
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
and
we
submit
that
this
decision
of
howard
versus
first
is
well
reasoned,
it's
consistent
and
logical.
we
have
also
cited
a
case
called
lapchak
versus
sisto,
judge
dimock
in
the
district
court
in
new
york
in
which
he,
to
our
way
of
mind,
succinctly
states
the
situation
with
respect
to
proxy
solicitation.
in
this
lapchak
case,
we
had
a
fact
situation
very
similar
to
the
one
in
the
case
at
bar,
where
there
was
a
claim
that
director's
had
--
have
profited
by
a
sale
of
assets
of
a
corporation.
judge
dimock
states
it
very
succinctly
this
way.
he
says,
"if
the
proxy
statement
which
is
alleged
to
be
bad
under
section
14
(a)
of
the
act
were
followed
by
a
fair
exchange,
the
directors
would
not
be
liable
to
the
corporation.
also,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
had
the
proxy
statement
been
perfectly
lawful
but
followed
by
an
unfair
exchange,
the
directors
would
be
liable.
since
liability,
asserted
by
plaintiffs
and
maybe
approved
without
regard
to
the
proxy
statements
and
cannot
be
proved
without
regard
to
the
alleged
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
the
plaintiffs
are
asserting
a
right
under
or
created
by
federal
law.
we
believe
the
logic
and
the
consistency
of
that
statement
is
irrefutable.
in
--
in
fact,
we
don't
believe
that
opposing
counsel
has
sufficiently
distinguished
the
case
or
made
a
real
comment
on
it.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
that
is
true.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
well,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
where
you
--
where
you've
come
to
court
and
ask
for
broad
retrospective
relief
like
rescission
and
damages,
that
the
reference
to
a
violation
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
is
not
the
nexus
of
the
complaint.
that
really
what
you
are
seeking
when
you're
bringing
a
derivative
action
is
a
--
a
common
law
claim
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
and
that
is
what's
--
mr.
walter
s.
davis
in
the
merger
itself.
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
provisions
in
the
securities
exchange
act
which
cover
penalties
and
regulation
of
people
that
issue
bad
proxy
statements.
but
the
point
is
that
the
--
that
proxy
statement
and
the
solicitation
of
proxies
is
only
a
collateral
function
in
the
whole
of
merger
--
corporate
merger
process.
if
all
of
the
stockholders
came
to
the
corporate
meeting,
of
course
you
--
you
wouldn't
have
the
--
any
problem
with
proxy
solicitation
but
you
still
have
the
question
as
to
whether
the
directors
discharge
their
fiduciary
duty
and
made
a
honest
transaction
and
that
is
the
point
that
the
--
the
proxy
statement
is
--
is
not
within
the
main
thrust
of
the
complaint
and
therefore
--
mr.
walter
s.
davis
like
a
full
disclosure.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
right.
mr.
walter
s.
davis
exactly,
as
judge
dimock
said.
the
proxy
statement
may
be
good,
the
bargain
proposed
may
be
so
grossly
inadequate
as
to
constitute
constructive
fraud
but
if
the
proxy
statement
is
good,
you
still
have
the
cause
of
action
of
whether
the
directors
breached
their
fiduciary
duty.
and
that
the
one
does
not
make
the
other
one
moot
and
that
is
our
contention
here.
now
secondly,
the
seventh
circuit
held
with
respect
to
count
2
that
if
the
stockholder
plaintiff
sought
a
vindication
of
the
--
the
federal
right
to
full
disclosure
which
plainly
the
act
requires,
that
he
could
have
such.
in
fact,
this
respondent
here
asks
for
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
the
proxies
meet
or
do
not
meet
the
standards
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
act
and
the
rules
and
regulations
thereunder.
but
in
accordance
with
dann
versus
studebaker
which
was
the
case
applied
to
this
situation
by
our
trial
court
that
would
be
all
that
the
stockholder
would
be
entitled
to
because
that
is
the
only
right
that
the
federal
law
creates,
is
the
duty
of
full
disclosure
and
the
right
that
the
investor
be
form
--
informed.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
addition
point.
we
believe
that
the
howard
versus
first
decision
and
dann
versus
studebaker,
are
correct.
that
is
we,
the
individual
petitioners
here.
we
say
they're
logical
and
consistent
and
they
do
not
create
a
lot
of
damage
and
strained
construction
of
the
statutes.
i
would
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
being
logical
isn't
the
whole
answer,
that
there
is
a
question
of
what
are
the
policy
considerations
here.
and
we
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
court
should
not
feel
free
to
allow
the
state
statute
for
security,
for
expenses
to
be
applied
here
because
in
the
securities
exchange
act
itself,
under
the
--
under
sections
9
(e),
section
18
(a),
both
of
which
creates
specific
causes
