justice
potter
stewart
so
supposed
a
vice
and
proxy
statement
has
its
failure
to
make
a
--
a
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
what
the
exchange
is
going
to
be.
and
i
suppose
if
the
proxy
statement
did
make
a
full
and
complete
and
fair
disclosure
of
whatever
the
merger
was
going
to
be,
even
though
the
conditions
of
the
merger
in
the
opinion
of
some
stockholders
would
be
unfair.
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
proxy
statement
if
it
fully
describe
with
what
the
--
those
conditions
were
going
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
judge
dimock's
--
reading
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
basically,
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
all
their
proxy
statement
needs
to
be
as
to
be
honest,
isn't
that
right?
to
make
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
what's
--
what
is
proposed.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
what
is
proposed
may
in
the
opinion
of
some
--
some
shareholders
be
terribly
unfair.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
personal
right
in
count
2,
their
--
their
right
to
be
fully
informed
of
the
--
of
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
merger,
isn't
that
right?
that's
the
federal
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
kind
of
a
personal
right.
justice
potter
stewart
why
isn't
the
remedy
provided
by
the
state,
a
--
an
appraisal
or
to
the
ordinary
dissenter's
remedy
of
a
--
of
an
appraisal
on
attached
payment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened
in
this
case?
this
is
wisconsin.
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
--
did
he
invoke
his
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
we
have
the
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
a
--
a
derivative
action.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
