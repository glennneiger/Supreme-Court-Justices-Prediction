you
would
say
that
was
true
whether
the
fifth
applied
to
the
states
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
it
really
then
what
you
got
--
you
just
get
to
knapp
against
schweitzer
rather
than
the
fifth
amendment
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
feldman
rule
the
other
way
though?
let's
assume
that
feldman
is
overruled
by
the
court
now,
let's
assume
that
it
had.
what
would
be
the
situation
for
you
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
given
a
--
did
give
a
testimony

would
be
the

what
would
have
been
the
situation
here
then?

byron
r.
white

easy
to
get
to
knapp?
