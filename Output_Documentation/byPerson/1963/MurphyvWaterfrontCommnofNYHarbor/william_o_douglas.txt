william
o.
douglas
doesn't
the
matter
of
inquiry,
you
said
the
commission
was
not
a
federal
agency.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
doesn't
the
commission
deal
almost
exclusively
with
federal
questions,
interstate
questions?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
you
owed
your
existence
to
federal
compact.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
enough.
i
think
you're
in
the
inter-state
field
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
a
federal
compact.
