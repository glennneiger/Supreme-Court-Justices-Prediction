mr.
william
p.
sirignano
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
state
to
this
court
that
the
waterfront
commission
is
a
state
agency
pure
and
simple,
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
cooperates
with
law
enforcement
officers
on
some
occasions
does
not
make
it
a
federal
agency.
there
are
some
questions
in
this
case
that
are
peculiar
to
this
particular
case.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
can
reach
a
decision
in
this
case
on
the
particular
factual
situation
here
without
arriving
at
the
general
policy
consideration
of
knapp
v.
schweitzer
and
the
feldman
case,
and
those
are
the
questions
of
waiver,
estoppel
and
the
claim
of
the
incrimination
being
a
reasonable
one
in
this
particular
case.
when
these
petitioners,
first
appeared
before
the
commission
pursuant
to
a
subpoena,
which
at
that
time
was
investigating
whether
a
work
stoppage
that
was
occurring
at
the
hoboken
piers,
contained
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
participants
any
violation
on
the
waterfront
commission
act.
they
took
the
position
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
conduct
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
any
violations
of
the
waterfront
commission
compact
were
being
committed
on
the
part
of
any
licensed
personnel
or
any
other
persons.
they
were
specifically
asked,
do
you
claim
that
your
refusal
to
answer
questions
is
based
on
your
possible
incrimination
and
the
answer
was
no.
we
refuse
to
answer
questions
because
this
is
a
federal
matter,
it
involves
interstate
commerce,
it's
a
matter
that
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government
and
the
waterfront
commission
is
a
(inaudible)
local
in
this
area.
certainly,
there
is
no
question
that
matters
that
do
involve
work
stoppages,
labor
problems
may
also
be
violations
of
state
law.
for
instance
simply
the
matter
we
are
looking
here
as
to
whether
there
was
any
coercion
in
these
particular
facts
work
stoppage.
this
matter
was
taken
up.
they
refused
to
answer.
we
bought
a
proceeding
to
cite
the
petitioners
in
contempt.
even
at
the
first
contempt
proceeding,
the
petitioners
maintained
that
there
were
no
crimes
or
possible
crimes
involved
here
and
that
we
were
just
out
of
our
scope
in
bringing
this
proceeding.
the
court
did
not
recognize
any
such
crime
grounds
and
they
were
held
in
contempt.
they
went
on
to
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
affirmed.
they
were
brought
back
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
that
was
continuing
in
this
investigation
and
it's
the
same
proceeding,
and
upon
their
reappearance
after
a
lot
of
talk,
much
of
which
i
was
unable
to
understand
what
their
position
really
was,
they
finally
said,
we
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
it
will
incriminate
us,
a
complete
reversal
of
their
first
position.
now
if
that
particular
proceeding,
the
subpoena
was
adjourned
and
it
was
specifically
told
that
the
subpoena
was
being
adjourned
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
commission
wished
to
grant
immunity
in
this
case.
after
a
discussion
with
the
commission,
the
commission
decided
to
grant
such
immunity
and
unnecessary
pre-requites
under
our
immunity
statue
which
is
similar
to
the
immunity
statue
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
it's
copied
exactly
after
that
one,
was
given
to
the
various
district
attorneys
and
the
attorney
generals
involved.
on
october
the
27th,
the
witnesses
were
called
back.
they
were
questioned
and
again
they
took
the
position
that
they
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
incrimination.
at
this
point
in
a
pop-up
proceeding
complying
with
all
requirements
of
the
statute
and
by
direction
of
the
commission
or
the
commission
designees,
they
were
directed
to
answer,
and
under
the
statute
that
direction
confers
immunity.
now
for
the
first
time
they
raise
the
question
of
federal
incrimination
and
specifically
in
that
proceeding
they
were
told
that
there
was
no
law
that
required
a
state
to
grant
the
immunity,
nor
could
state
grant
such
federal
immunity
that
would
protect
them
in
their
refusal
to
answer
and
they
persisted
in
that
refusal.
at
that
very
proceeding
counsel
was
directed
to
institute
contempt
proceedings
for
their
refusal.
again
it
went
right
through
another
series
of
litigations.
they
were
convicted
of
civil
and
criminal
contempt
in
a
superior
court.
it
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court,
the
civil
contempt
was
affirmed,
the
criminal
attempt
was
remanded
for
new
trial
on
the
basis
that
they
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
and
to
their
mottos
and
refusal
to
testify.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
right
sir.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
the
rationale
is
that
you
cannot
and
the
supreme
court
has
so
said,
continue
a
litigation
one
step
at
a
time,
that
you
must
make
your
position
clear,
so
that
if
there
is
a
determination
on
the
position,
then
the
question
will
be
resolved
rather
than
take
it
step
wise,
first
to
claim
no
jurisdiction,
you
come
back
and
then
you
claim
another
ground
and
then
you
come
back
and
claim
the
third
ground
and
it
goes
on
ad
infinitum.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
yes
and
they
did
so
on
two
grounds,
one
was
that
it
became
unnecessary
to
determine
that
and
decided
on
that
ground
because
they
were
doing
on
the
broader
ground
that
they
didn't
have
any
federal
incrimination
anyway.
and
then
number
two
ground
was
that
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
court
below
and
we
submit
that
we
did
raise
it
because
we
argued
to
the
court
that
these
--
the
petitions
were
playing
fast
and
lose
with
the
court
by
taking
inconsistent
positions
that
did
not
claim
it
before.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
yes,
i
think
so
because
if
that
federal
right
is
involved
here
that
we
could
urge
any
ground
in
a
record
concerning
that
a
federal
right
and
if
there
was
a
waiver
i
think
this
court
should
consider
the
waiver.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
right,
and
i
think
they've
waived
that
federal
right.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
correct
sir,
that's
my
argument.
now,
besides
the
waiver
we
also
argue
that
they
are
estopped,
that
they
can
take
inconsistent
positions
with
the
court
and
finding
out
that
they
are
not
successful
in
one
position
make
a
complete
search
--
switch
and
then
take
another
position
which
is
directly
contrary
and
the
third
position
is
that
we
come
from
the
ground
of
the
reasonableness
of
their
claim.
in
the
first
context,
the
thrust
of
their
whole
argument
was
there
were
no
crimes
at
all
committed
here
and
therefore
we
could
not
enquire.
therefore
they
must
have
believed
that
there
could
have
been
no
possible
incrimination,
when
that
was
not
held
to
be
successful
they
then
switched
and
say,
now
we
are
concerned
about
crimes
and
when
they
took
the
stand
in
a
superior
court
to
pinpoint
the
area
of
their
crimes,
the
records
show
there
is
lot
of
mumbo-jumbo
and
the
only
thing
that
appears
to
be
that
they
are
claiming
is
first
from
interstate
commerce.
now
i
think
it
takes
an
awful
lot
of
gullibility
to
believe
that
a
work
stoppage
involving
400
or
500
people
takes
places
and
ensues
for
the
purpose
of
committing
some
thefts
and
then
all
that
context
of
this
record,
their
claim
is
not
reasonable
that
they
are
fearing
federal
incrimination.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
only
in
the
briefs,
never
--
in
the
briefs
in
this
particular
case
in
this
court,
never
before.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
before
the
court?
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
we
took
the
position
there
might
have
been
a
possible
violation
of
the
state
law
530
cohesion
of
the
penal
law
of
state
of
new
york,
section
530.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
a
misdemeanor,
it's
a
misdemeanor
to
coerce
a
person
to
do
something
he
has
right
not
to
do
and
that
was
the
area
of
the
investigation.
now,
on
all
these
grounds,
i
think
that
this
honorable
court,
could
decide
this
case
without
reaching
the
main
problem
or
the
main
concern
of
the
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
the
feldman
case.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
no.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
then
my
position
is
before
this
court
is
that
the
petitioners
have
no
right
to
give
you
the
answer
on
the
basis
of
federal
incrimination.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
mills
versus
louisiana,
jack
versus
knapp.
and
that
the
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
we
are
not
concerned
whether
this
court
determined
that
the
fifth
does
apply
to
the
states
or
doesn't
apply
to
the
states
because
i
think
this
question
stands
alone,
it
is
entirely
independent
of
that.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
if
your
honor
pleases,
i'd
base
that
statement
on
the
hard
decisions
of
this
court.
that
even
though
the
federal
government
requires
that
a
man
be
protected,
the
constitution
requires
a
man
to
be
protected
against
federal
incrimination
or
federal
proceeding,
the
cases
this
court
holds
they
he
need
not
be
given
protection
in
a
state
proceeding.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
no
that's
not
--
as
i
see
it
your
honor,
justice
harlan
in
the
(inaudible)
case
felt
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
the
states,
but
yet
when
it
came
to
the
murdoch
case
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
right,
he
was
in
dissent,
right,
but
when
it
came
into
murdoch
case
â€“-
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
in
the
jack
v.
kansas
case,
he
felt
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
required
that
the
states
honor
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
pardon?
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
i
don't
think
that
the
feldman
case
is
reached
in
my
argument
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
pardon?
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
because
this
case
is
not
right
for
the
determination
as
to
whether
feldman
should
stand
or
not.
there
is
no
threat
or
there
is
no
prosecution
pending
in
this
case
against,
the
federal
prosecution
pending
against
these
defendants.
it's
been
four
years
since
you've
come
to
act,
and
there
hasn't
been
the
slightest
interest
on
the
part
of
any
federal
prosecutor
and
the
remoteness
of
it
being
one
is
obvious
in
the
facts
itself.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
by
that
do
you
mean
sir
that
the
man
could
not
be
incriminated
for
felony
had
he
given
testimony
in
the
state
proceeding?
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
right.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
he
should
have
been
held
in
contempt
and
this
court
should
sustain
it.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
on
that
theory,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
yes.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
on
the
contrary
your
honor,
very
rarely
do
we
deal
with
the
federal
questions.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
no
to
a
compact
between
states.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
and
the
only
federal
participation
is
an
approval
by
congress.
there
is
no
federal
member
to
the
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
only
so
far
as
the
constitution
requires
that
a
compact
between
states
--
get
congressional
approval,
but
strictly
in
state
activities
and
the
licensing
of
the,
watchman,
longshoreman,
stevedore
doing
business
in
the
conducting
of
hiring
calls,
employment
centers,
we
are,
we
are
not
in
interstate
commerce,
in
anyway
concerned
with
it.
we
say
that
the
dualism
that's
opened
up
in
the
knapp
versus
schweitzer
case
concerning
the
respective
fields
of
the
state
and
the
federal
government
should
be
preserved
because
it
is
recognized,
the
state
have
the
primary
responsibility
of
enforcement
of
criminal
law
into
our
system
of
government.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
they
could
never
confer
federal
immunity
your
honor.
the
only
possibility
is
that
the
federal
government
makes
the
determination
in
connection
with
a
federal
case,
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
that
testimony
adduced
by
the
compelling
state
statute
be
excluded.
it's
not
the
state
that
excludes
it
is
the
federal
government
and
the
statute
and
federal
court
that
will
exclude
it.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
no
more
than
that
a
police
officer,
well
those
(inaudible)
what
coerces
a
confession
of
someone
in
the
state
court
and
that
could,
the
court
will
not
admit
that
that's
why
giving
federal
immunity,
he
is
not
referring
to
federal
immunity
the
courts
will
just
admit
into
evidence
because
the
fifth
amendment
protects
that
person.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
certainly
is,
it's
a
much
dependant
and
much
more
drastic
proposition
because
in
order
to
do
that
the
court
will
have
to
decide
with
greater
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
a
criminal
justice,
was
liable
enforcing
that
particular
proposition
you
suggest
against
the
enforceability
of
the
law
and
the
effectiveness
of
law
enforcement
in
the
states
and
it's
our
position
in
this
case,
that
the
mills
versus
louisiana
and
knapp
versus
schweitzer
rule
should
preserve
that
dualism
and
that
if
this
court
feels
that
they
must
be
given
some
protection
in
advance
to
a
state
witness
then,
the
way
to
deal
with
that
is
to
not
upset
knapp
versus
schweitzer
but
take
another
look
at
ullmann.
and
taking
another
look
at
ullmann,
you
can't
consider
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
role
that
this
court
has
taken
in
the
search
and
seizure
cases.
now
this
is
the
first
case
that
it
comes
to
this
court
since
the
elkin
case,
where
the
supervisory
rule
was
overturned
and
if
the
court
feels
that
in
the
light
of
the
elkin
case
they
must
reconsider
ullmann
and
exclude
this
testimony,
but
still
preserve
the
right
to
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
if
they
receive
entirely
independent
evidence
not
at
all
connected
with
the
coerced
testimony
or
not
the
fruits
of
that
testimony
then
that
will
still
preserve
the
contempt,
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
have
some
contentions
here
in
which
they
claim
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
this
is
a
civil
contempt
and
i
know
of
no
case
either
state
or
federal
that
requires
that
there
be
a
jury
trial
in
a
civil
contempt
case.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
pardon.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
yes,
there
was.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
correct,
but
he
did
not
remain
committed
until
he
paid
that
fine.
knowing
he
may
commit
until
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
that's
right,
$50
fine
which
is
permissible
under
the
civil
contempt
statute
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
he
also
claims
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
trial
--
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
to
remain
incarcerated
until
he
confines
with
the
court
order
to
purge
himself.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
i
think
that's
the
maximum
fine
your
honor,
i
think
so.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
in
principle
until
you
testify.
no
stated
imprisonment.
mr.
william
p.
sirignano
right.
in
this
case
there
was
also
conviction
for
criminal
conviction
and
which
was
reversed,
which
carried
a
state
imprisonment
of
30
days.
there
is
also
claim
that
he
was
â€“
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
good
faith.
in
mccomb
versus
jacksonville
paper,
336
u.s.
187,
says
that
in
a
civil
contempt
case,
that
the
motives
are
material
as
a
defense.
in
fact
they
are
even
material
in
the
criminal
contempt
sinclair
versus
united
states
and
again
they
may
purge
themselves
by
testifying
at
any
time.
they
also
claim
that
they
were
asked
for
discovery
and
they
were
not
given
discovery
and
they
claimed
they
were
forced
to
take
the
privilege
of
self
incrimination
as
the
doc.
again
this
is
an
inconsistent
position
of
the
petitioners.
first
they
say
they
fear
self-incrimination,
and
then
they
say
they
are
in
the
dark
and
they
don't
know
what's
going
on.
but
at
any
rate
this
court
had
held
in
hannah
versus
larche
363
u.s,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
make
a
complete
disclosure
of
what
the
investigating
body
is
looking
into
in
order
to
compel
them
to
answer
because
in
effect
it
would
destroy
the
efficacy
of
the
investigation
in
many
instances
if
that
were
done.
and
as
to
the
argument
about
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
there
is
no
question
here,
this
is
an
immunity
statue
of
general
application
to
anyone
who
comes
before
the
waterfront
commission
in
the
inquiry
if
he
is
granted
immunity
the
statue
applies
to
him.
it's
just
like
special
immunity
statues
and
special
cases
and
special
crimes,
and
that
certainly
is
not
(inaudible)
by
this
court,
an
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
for
the
reasons
stated
i
urge
this
court
to
reaffirm
the
conviction
of
civil
contempt
in
this
case.
