mr.
harold
krieger
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
might
say
i
just
want
to
refer
to
the
facts
very
briefly
although
we
have
gone
to
them
in
detail
in
our
brief.
in
may
of
1960,
both
of
these
petitioners
were
subpoenaed
before
the
waterfront
commission
of
the
new
york
harbor,
which
is
a
bistate
commission
having
been
set
up
by
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
a
compact
that
was
approved
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
waterfront
crime
or
crime
in
new
york
harbor
involving
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
among
other
things
liasioning
the
individuals
to
work
on
the
peers.
at
the
time
both
of
these
petitioners
were
subpoenaed
to
testify
in
may
of
1960,
they
were
--
the
commission
was
asked
for
appraisal
as
to
the
purpose
and
they
were
advised
that
they
were
investigating
a
strike
or
stoppage.
counsels
for
both
of
these
petitioners
at
that
time
urged
that
the
commission
was
without
jurisdiction
in
that
preemption
applied
and
the
field
had
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
the
commission
at
that
time
then
proceeded
to
secure
an
order
of
show
cause
in
our
state
court,
superior
court
why
they
shouldn't
be
held
of
contempt
and
in
the
application
and
in
the
order
of
show
cause
they
then
alleged
and
gave
the
background
of
the
waterfront
commission,
why
it
had
been
set
up
and
the
various
investigations
that
had
taken
place
in
new
york
and
in
new
jersey
prior
to
the
setting
up
of
this
commission
and
the
passage
of
the
statute
showing
that
there
had
been
crimes
committed
in
the
state
and
foreign
commerce
and
there
were
racketeering
and
things
of
that
nature,
thefts,
pilferage,
and
so
forth,
and
that
they
had
a
right
to
investigate
of
this
particular
stoppage
in
strike
because
it
involved
a
chief
security
officer
that
was
employed
by
the
american
export
line.
that
was
the
first
general
appraisal
that
these
petitioners
had
that
the
commission
was
then
seeking
to
investigate
a
crime
or
crimes.
because
prior
to
that
time
they
were
asked
by
counsels
specifically
whether
or
not
they
were
investigating
a
crime,
the
answer
was
they
didn't
know
or
whether
it
was
purely
a
labor
dispute.
the
petitioners
were
found
guilty
by
the
superior
court
in
new
jersey
and
the
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
had
held
in
that
case
that
the
field
had
not
been
preempted
and
that
the
as
far
as
the
appraisal
was
concerned,
they
were
apprised
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
a
superior
court
of
the
decision
of
the
waterfront
commission.
we
then
sought
to
appeal
and
apply
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
petition,
or
petition
of
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
had
been
denied.
fact
is
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
new
jersey
held
that
the
devo
case
was
dispositive
on
the
issue.
the
petitioners
were
then
called
back,
were
then
proceeded
to
go
back
into
the
superior
court
to
comply
with
the
order
and
might
i
say
in
that
contempt
they
were
sentenced
to
jail
until
they
answered
the
questions
and
to
pay
a
$50
fine.
they
then
proceeded
and
paid
the
$50
fine
and
were
directed
by
the
court
to
appear
before
the
waterfront
commission
to
respond.
they
did
appear
on
october
3rd
and
at
that
time
when
they
were
interrogated,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
i
represented
them
there
at
that
time
as
one
of
a
counsels,
we
asked
specifically
for
an
appraisal,
pertinence
and
we
were
advised
that
we
were
sufficiently
apprised
in
the
previous
proceedings
and
that
the
purpose
was
the
same
purpose
as
heretofore
as
alleged
in
the
moving
papers
in
the
state
courts
that
they
were
investigating
and
these
papers
indicated
investigation
of
crime
and
racketeering.
the
petitioners
then
asserted
their
constitutional
rights
and
statutory
rights,
and
the
hearing
officer
then
stated
for
the
purpose
of
record,
some
25
times
it
appears
on
that
october
3rd
date,
that
he
recognized
their
rights
to
assert
the
constitutional
privilege
and
the
statutory
privilege
and
the
next
morning
petitioners
appeared
before
the
superior
court
and
they
were
purged
of
the
contempt.
the
court
had
held
that
they
had
satisfied
the
order
and
upon
the
payment
of
the
fine,
which
still
remained,
they
were
released.
the
waterfront
commission
at
that
time
said
they
didn't
want
the
case
to
close
up
because
they
contended
that
they
wanted
to
consider
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to
then
grant
immunity.
this
is
also
said
at
the
end
of
the
interrogation
on
october
3rd,
so
up
until
that
point
we
had
no
thought
that
there
was
any
intention
to
try
to
confer
some
sort
of
an
immunity
in
this
case
because
of
the
period
clearly
in
the
interrogation
on
october
3rd,
that
the
waterfront
commission
recognized
the
use
of
the
constitutional
provision
here
and
the
statutory
provision
and
fact
the
fifth
amendment
had
been
used
and
also
due
process
was
argued
at
the
time
on
october
3rd.
when
it
appeared
on
october
4th
--
mr.
harold
krieger
new
jersey
statute
evidence
act
of
1960
and
might
i
say
at
this
moment
that
new
jersey
evidence
act
of
1960
--
your
honor
new
jersey
evidence
act
of
1960
specifically
provides
and
is
broad.
“a
witness
may
refuse
to
testify
to
any
matter
that
can
incriminate
him
as
far
as
the
state
and
the
other
state
or
the
federal
government”
and
the
history
of
the
statute
as
far
as
the
legislation
is
concerned,
was
an
indication
by
the
legislature
that
they
were
taking
into
consideration
the
hoffman
case
and
they
were
making
the
rule
as
broad
as
it
was
intended
in
the
hoffman
case.
when
we
appeared
in
--
on
october
4th
the
court
had
held
that
these
--
as
i
indicated
before
that
these
witnesses
had
purged
themselves
of
contempt
and
when
the
waterfront
commission
has
said
well
we
would
like
to
consider
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
grant
immunity
here,
the
court
said
specifically
i
am
not
concerned
with
what
you
may
do
that
maybe
another
matter,
these
people
have
met
the
order
of
the
court
and
they
are
discharged.
we
read
in
the
papers
shortly
thereafter
that
they
were
going
to
grant
some
sort
of
immunity
and
then
we
proceeded
to
apply
for
a
quashing
of
the
subpoena,
well
we
read
this
in
the
paper
because
we
felt
at
that
time
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
immunity
under
these
circumstances.
before
the
return,
they
have
notice
to
motion
for
the
quashing
of
the
subpoena
that
waterfront
commission
had
ordered
the
petitioner
to
appear.
well,
they
found
themselves
to
be
twitched
in
between,
so
we
appeared,
petitioners
appeared
and
then
they
had
some
sort
of
a
new
form
of
hearing,
it
was
a
public
hearing.
they
called
that
a
public
meeting
in
which
the
commissioners
--the
designees
rather
sat
in
open
hearing,
an
open
meeting,
and
proceeded
to
this
hearing
by
indicating
that
they
were
now
going
to
question
both
these
petitioners
on
a
matter
that
they
had
heretofore,
questioned
them
on
october
3rd
they
were
asked
for
an
appraisal.
and
the
decision
of
the
commission
was
well
you
have
been
sufficiently
apprised
in
the
proceedings
that
have
taken
place
heretofore
and
were
resting
on
that.
they
were
asked
specifically
this
question,
will
you
please
produce
an
order
so
that
we
would
know
the
scope
of
this
investigation
by
this
commission,
how
far,
where
you
are
going
into,
what
appeals,
and
they
refused.
there
was
no
indication
whether
that
such
an
order
existed,
or
didn't
exist,
or
whether
wasn't,
until
this
day
we
don't
know
or
whether
or
not
there
was
such
an
order
by
the
commission
for
this
investigation.
the
petitioners
were
then
–
then
objection
was
made
on
the
ground
of
due
process,
the
failure
of
proper
appraisal.
however,
they
continued
and
the
petitioners
asserted
the
privilege
of
–
and
specifically
stated
that
they
were
stating
the
fifth
amendment
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
application
and
directly
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
this
was
a
bistate
agency
engaged
in
the
investigate
--
crime
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
counsel
then
indicated
for
the
commission
or
might
i
say
one
of
the
designees
was
also
counsel
for
commission,
my
--
mr.
sirignano
was
sitting
then
in
place
of
the
commissioner,
indicated
that
they
were
going
to
grant
the
immunity
--
mr.
harold
krieger
pardon
me,
fifth,
fifth
amendment,
i
am
sorry
fifth
amendment,
i
said
fifteenth,
pardon
me,
well
fifteenth
i'm
sorry,
that
was
specifically
said
for
and
in
fact
the
counsel
for
the
commission
mr.
piagra
who
appeared
at
that
time
interrogating
said
specifically
we
understand
that
you
are
alleging
the
fifth
amendment.
then
counsel
said,
we
are
now
giving
you
this
form
of
immunity
having
given
notices
to
prosecutors
in
hudson
county
and
new
jersey
and
in
new
york
county
and
the
attorney
generals
of
both
states
which
is
a
from
the
statute
itself
provides
some
form
of
immunity
on
such
notice.
whether
or
not
that
is
proper
or
i'm
not
going
into
but
it
seems
so
much
fast,
it's
not
a
self
executionary
statute
of
immunity,
it's
one
that
the
commission
can
decide
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
give
or
not
give.
however,
we
objected
to
it
and
we
also
then
objected
that
the
immunity
was
not
broad
enough.
the
immunity
was
not
as
broad
as
the
privilege
and
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
because
the
state's
evidence
that
we
typically
provides
and
this
is
one
state
that
thought
ahead
and
said
that
a
privilege
maybe
asserted
if
it
involves
any
federal
incrimination
on
1960
act
and
then
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
counsel
then
indicated
to
the
petitioners
that
they
would
not
be
charged
or
they
could
not
be
charged
with
any
crime
that
they
were
testifying
as
to
and
they
were
immune
from
prosecution.
counsel
was
then
asked
specifically
are
you
advising
these
petitioners
that
they
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
any
federal
offense
in
this
matter
and
then
they
took
a
position
for
the
first
time,
oh
no,
we
don't
have
to
do
that,
it's
not
necessary
that
we
do
that,
the
immunity
doesn't
have
to
go
to
any
federal
offense.
the
petitioners
was
then
directed
further
to
answer
and
this
interrogation
continued
on
insofar
and
continued
to
a
point
where
petitioners
were
interrogated
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
still
engaged
in
this
type
of
crime.
it
probably
appeared
that
during
this
--
during
this
investigation
the
same
waterfront
commission
had
filed
in
one
of
their
own
proceedings,
a
charge
against
the
some
them
in
which
they
named
both
of
these
petitioners
as
coconspirators
in
that
matter
involved
in
this
illegal
act.
they
then
proceeded
immediately
to
go
ahead
with
a
note
of
show-cause
for
contempt
allover
again
and
directed
the
counsel
to
do
so,
we
then
proceeded
in
court
and
there,
there
was
an
argument
in
court.
at
the
time
of
the
argument,
we,
prior
there
too
had
served
this
motion
to
quash
subpoena
which
was
retainable
on
the
same
date
as
the
order
show-cause
for
contempt
and
we
also
served
upon
them
a
demand
for
bill
of
particulars
and
we
served
upon
them
a
demand
for
interrogatory
and
a
demand
for
jury
trial,
reserving
the
right
for
admissions
triage
and
so
forth.
the
order
of
show-cause
merely
maybe
turned
upon
whether
or
not
they
should
or
should
not
be
held
for
contempt,
but
the
petitions
filed
said,
requested
and
prayed
that
they
be
held
the
both
civil
and
criminal
contempt,
but
the
order
to
show-cause
did
not.
on
the
returning
date
of
this
order
to
show-cause,
we
first
proceeded
to
argue
the
question
of
law,
because
it
was
our
contention
and
we
also
joined
the
motion
to
quash
that
the
immunity
was
not
as
broad
as
a
privilege
and
therefore
there
should
a
disposition
on
the
motion
and
if
the
motion
is
disposed
off
in
our
favor
that
would
end
the
case.
we
continued
to
argue
at
length
on
the
questions
of
law
and
during
the
argument
some
questions
came
up
as
this
taking
of
testimony
and
through
out
the
record
it
appears
that
i
argued
that
matter
in
which
i
stated
to
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial
we
will
develop
certain
factors
and
the
court
for
the
first
time
and
during
this
argument
said,
oh
there
will
be
no
trial
and
there
will
be
no
testimony
taken.
we
are
going
to
dispose
over
this
now.
we
had
gotten
to
the
point
where
and
to
avoid
any
question
because
in
the
briefs
to
the
waterfront
commission
they
had
indicated
that
we
haven't
pinpointed
any
particular
federal
offenses
and
we
have
one
case
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
vaitauer,
in
which
there
have
been
some
question
by
the
supreme
court
that
a
witness
must
pinpoint
the
area
in
which
he
could
incriminate
himself.
and
i
had
offered
proof
on
that
question
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
about
that
so
that
there
could
be
no
argument
later
on,
there
was
no
proof
of
it
and
finally
the
next
day
the
court
said
well
i
will
hear
you
on
one
question
only
and
from
which
i've
put
in
some
proof
on
the
one
the
one
question
so
far
as
incrimination
is
concerned,
a
federal
incrimination
and
then
we
offered
a
various
proofs
insofar
as
(inaudible)
interstate
commerce
had
to
be
involved.
we
submitted
a
brief
which
was
incorporated
part
of
the
record
involving
conspiracy
interstate
commerce,
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
civil
rights
and
things
of
that
nature
and
persons
right
to
hold
the
job
and
things
of
that
nature.
the
court
then
disposed
off
the
case
by
holding
the
defendants
guilty
--
or
petitioners
guilty
of
both
criminal
and
civil
contempt
and
sentenced
them
to
30
days
in
the
county
jail,
$50
fine
and
to
remain
confined
until
they
answered
these
specific
questions
that
was
set
forth
in
the
order.
we
appealed
to
the
supreme
--
we
appealed
appellate
division
and
the
supreme
court
listed
the
case.
and
at
the
time
of
the
argument
before
the
supreme
court
in
this
opinion
various
questions
were
raised
and
the
supreme
court
first
held
that
as
far
as
privilege
is
concerned,
as
far
as
the
waiver
is
concerned,
as
far
as
immunity
(inaudible)
that
the
immunity
didn't
have
to
be
as
broad
as
to
cover
federal
incrimination.
in
(inaudible)
there
was
this
positive
of
the
issue
and
the
argument
insofar
as
preemption
is
concerned
they
held
that
that
had
been
disposed
of
the
previous
case
and
it
was
no
longer
before
the
court.
as
far
as
jury
trial
is
concerned
the
court
held
as
far
as
that
was
concerned,
that
was
discretionary
with
the
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
be.
what
became
so
obvious
and
the
court
in
it's
opinion
will
indicate
that
we
had
no
trial
that
they
reversed
the
criminal
contempt
sent
that
back,
made
the
judgment
to
read
that
the
petitioners
would
be
confined
to
jail
and
pay
the
fine
of
$50
until
they
had
purged
themselves
but
the
fine
would
remain
however.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
if
your
honors
please,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
we
have
an
agency
here
and
this
is
somewhat
different
poppy
in
many
of
the
cases
that
came
before
this
court
heretofore,
we
have
an
agency
that's
engaged
in
investigating
crime
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
no
question
about
that,
that's
the
job,
both
states
gave
them
to
do
and
that's
what
they
were
doing.
now
it's
some
form
of
agency
i
don't,
would
say
an
interstate
commerce
(inaudible)
federal
agency
if
you
want
to
call
it
such,
if
possible,
because
in
that
statute
they
have
a
right
to
get
federal
funds
and
if
they
get
federal
funds
they
have
certain
duties
there
in,
and
we
respectfully
submit
in
this
case
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
because
it
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
engaged
in
crime
--
engage
in
investigation
of
crime
in
interstate
commerce,
the
fifth
amendment
applied
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
they
have
just
considered
an
agency
only
at
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
new
york.
we
further
contend
that
there
was
a
failure
to
give
due
process
here,
there
was
failure
to
have
a
trial
on
the
contempt
now
that
has
been
called
civil
contempt,
frankly
i
can
say
it
the
civil
contempt
because
it
seems
somewhat
confused.
i
don't
know
of
a
civil
contempt
that
puts
a
penalty
on
a
man
as
well
as
sends
him
to
jail.
in
fact
there
is,
that
we've
(inaudible)
but
someday
we've
got
to
face
this
other
criminal
contempt
unless
there
is
a
reversal
by
this
court
on
a
principle
issue
but
they
have
a
penalty
to
pay
$50,
they
must
remain
in
jail
and
i
especially
contend
that
this
is
a
criminal
contempt
call
it
by
any
name
you
want
to
call
it,
any
man
is
fined,
any
man
has
a
penalty
to
pay
that's
a
criminal
contempt
on
the
(inaudible)
because
he
stays
in
jail
until
he
pays
his
penalty,
as
well
as
answering
the
questions.
however,
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
is
not
before
this
court.
we
respectfully
contend
that
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
applies
here.
now
i
know
this
court
will
not
consider
a
determination
made
by
a
state
court
insofar
as
interpretation
of
it's
own
statutes.
in
this
case
and
here
is
how
the
supreme
court
got
around
this
case
insofar
is
that
privilege
act
of
1960,
they
said
the
privilege
act
of
1960
didn't
repeal
immunity,
didn't
repealed
the
immunity
statute
of
the
waterfront
commission.
now
we
got
this
moved,
immunity
statute
of
waterfront
commission
is
limited
to
the
waterfront
commission
nobody
else,
we
have
no
general
immunity
statute
in
new
jersey.
then
this
1960
evidence
act
didn't
repeal
that,
because
if
they
haven't
said
that
they
would
have
had
to
say
that
the
evidence
act
applies.
now
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
here,
because
this
is
the
only
class
and
group
of
people
that
haven't
got
the
advantage
of
that
evidence
act,
because
of
the
waterfront
commission,
now
there
is
nothing
in
a
waterfront
commission
act
that
recognizes
the
right
of
privilege.
i
respectfully
submit
that
when
the
evidence
act
of
1960
was
passed,
they
repealed
the
previous
privilege
act,
specifically
repealed
the
previous
privilege
act.
now
if
and
that
is
so
the
statute
of
1960
repeals
the
previous
privilege
act
and
if
1960
act
of
privilege
doesn't
apply
to
these
people
then
there
is
no
privilege
act
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
that
applies
to
these
petitioners
who
are
connected
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
waterfront
commission
already
investigation
by
the
waterfront
commission,
there
is
no
privilege
act
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
applying
to
this
class
of
people.
as
a
class
they
are
eliminated
from
a
privilege
act
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
we
have
no
constitution
provision
in
new
jersey.
mr.
harold
krieger
no,
i'm
not
making
an
argument
that
for
state
to
give
immunity
must
give
it
to
everybody,
but
i'm
arguing
that
under
due
process
and
i
think
we
accept
it
as
such,
that
immunity
statute
--
privilege
statute
exists
in
every
state
either
statute
or
constitution
provision
then
this
would
be
the
only
state
that
they
doesn't
have
a
privilege
statute
as
far
as
group
of
people.
now
can
you
eliminate
a
group
of
people
and
say
this
group
of
people
shall
never
have
the
right
to
exercise
a
privilege?
that's
what
it
would
mean.
mr.
harold
krieger
i
believe
sir
that
you
can
grant
immunity
to
certain
people
under
certain
circumstances.
i
think
that's
clear,
that's
been
established
by
--
in
other
cases,
but
i
don't
go
along
and
don't
feel
like
you
can
deny
a
privilege
to
only
a
class.
privilege
and
immunity
are
two
different
things;
one
is
separate
apart
from
the
other.
of
course
the
courts
have
tried
to
get
around
by
saying
the
privilege
is
substituted
by
giving
immunity
in
some
situation
that
constitutes
the
use
of
the
privilege,
but
even
in
a
statute,
the
statute
says
that
the
privilege
--
that
the
immunity
doesn't
apply
unless
they
have
a
privilege
so
that
it's
recognized
that
there
must
be
some
privilege,
now
which
privileges
can
be
applied
here?
the
privilege
of
the
1960
evidence
act
or
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
reason
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process.
now
i
respectfully
submit,
that
where
we
have
a
commission
that's
engaged
specifically
in
the
investigation
of
crime
and
inter-state
and
foreign
commerce,
that
all
a
crime
could
be
involved,
that
they
could
possibly
investigate
would
be
in
that
area,
where
we
have
a
commission
that
works
in
close
cooperation
with
federal
authorities,
i
see
no
difference
between
this
commission
or
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
as
this
court
said
in
the
claire
case.
in
a
majority
opinion
it
said,
this
commission
cooperates
with
the
customs,
authorities,
and
what's
imposed
connection,
a
cooperation
with
him.
now
i
respectfully
submit
also
my
state
to
the
court
that
that
--
i'm
just
going
over
--
that
in
this
instance
they
had
failed
to
grant
any
immunity
that
would
be
cognizant
with
the
crime,
that
could
possibly
be
involved,
a
direct
recognition
of
them.
i
might
say
further
that
that
the
courts
have
denied
these
people
equal
protection
of
laws.
i
might
say
further
that
and
they
failed
to
give
them
discovery,
because
we
tried
very
hard
in
this
case
and
i
don't
know
if
anybody
would
have
tried
harder
to
get
an
appraisal,
pertinence
during
the
investigation,
during
examination
in
the
courts
and
denied
in
every
instance,
in
fact
there
the
supreme
court
said,
well
we're
not
going
to
pass
upon
the
question
of
discovery
here
because
it's
unnecessary,
we
dispose
of
that
by
reason
of
that
mapp
case
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
are
working
together
with
the
federal
authorities.
now
there
is
something
said
in
that
brief
they
know
of
no
inquiry
being
made,
but
nothing
by
federal
authorities,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
affect
at
all.
might
i
reserve
the
rest
of
time,
i
have
i
have
one
other
question
and
waiver
of
estoppel
and
i'd
like
to
use
that
if
i
may,
that's
asserted
by
my
adversaries
in
my
rebuttal
argument,
and
some
of
the
others
i'd
like
to
rest
on
my
brief
on
the
other
points
raised.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
krieger
yes,
i
feel
this
case
should
overrule
that.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
escape
why
they
should
be
sir.
i
think
we've
got
to
meet
the
question
head
on
once
and
for
all.
the
court
did
it
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
i
think
they
should
do
it
here
and
be
consistent.
i
think
it
calls
for
consistency.
i
think
the
feldman
case,
even
the
majority
opinion
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
that
the
fourth
and
fifth
intertwined
with
each
other.
he
said
it
doesn't
apply,
but
he
said
they
work
together
in
his
majority
opinion
and
might
i
save
--
i'll
save
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
specific
questions
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
krieger
your
honor
may
i
--
mr.
harold
krieger
thank
you
sir.
i
am
so
much
confused
frankly.
i
don't
think
my
learned
brother
sirignano
intended
to
mislead
this
court,
but
i
think
in
stating
some
of
the
facts,
he
is
error.
number
one,
the
first
time
that
these
people,
the
petitioners
were
faced
with
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
may
incriminate
themselves,
they
asserted
it
definitely
and
may
i
read
from
the
record.
at
page
30,
in
fact
it's
38,
at
the
first
hearing
on
october
3rd
after
when
they
came
back
to
purge
themselves
of
contempt
when
they
appeared
they
said
specifically
and
this
appears
some
25
times
and
i'm
not
going
burden
the
court
in
that
respect,
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
the
number
of
times
and
they
said
we
stand
on
our
constitutional
right
and
in
other
instances
they
say
the
statutory
rights
as
well
as
constitutional
rights.
and
this
is
the
interesting
part
of
this.
mr.
veigra
who
represented
the
commission
said
you
are
standing
on
your
rights
and
they
said,
yes.
mr.
cree,
you
recognize
the
right
of
the
use
of
his
privilege
of
the
constitution?
mr.
veigra
i
did
recognize
that.
mr.
morseman
who
is
sitting
to
my
right
here
next
to
mr.
sirignano
says
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
probably
waived,
they
continued
to
recognize
it.
then
when
we
got
into
court,
the
judge
on
the
purging
of
the
contempt
said
specifically
on
page
45
of
the
record,
that
court
is
satisfied
that
they
have
purged
themselves
of
that
contempt,
they
have
obeyed
the
subpoena,
appeared
for
examination,
they
have
been
examined
by
the
commission
and
the
record
of
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
as
read
to
this
court,
which
is
part
of
this
record
in
the
case
that
their
refusal
to
answer
was
recognized
as
a
proper
ground
and
legal
basis
for
their
so
refusing
to
answer
those
particular
questions.
as
the
record
then
stood,
namely,
on
the
basis
of
their
constitutional
right
that
it
may
tend
to
incriminate
them.
the
examiner
so
states
many,
many
times
in
the
record
that
had
been
presented
to
me.
the
fine
has
been
paid.
now
when
counsel
says
the
fine
had
been
paid
so
there
is
no
misunderstanding,
the
fine
had
been
paid
had
been
in
the
first
contempt
at
the
time
of
the
purging
in
may
of
1960,
in
this
instance
that
stills
stand
open
and
on
our
law
that
person
will
stand
confined
to
jail,
an
allowance
made
for
each
day
of
the
$50
until
the
$50
is
paid,
at
the
penalty
there
is
no
question
about
that.
now
insofar
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
the
incrimination
is
concerned
our
supreme
court
very
clearly
indicated
that
when
in
their
opinion
they
said
this
on
page
230
i
believe
it
is,
the
opinion,
page
230.
in
short,
the
waterfront
commission
when
acting
within
the
orbit
of
a
governmental
responsibility
which
the
states
have
expressed
or
by
fair
implication
agreed
to
vest
in
it
was
intended
to
be
free
for
many
unilateral
restraint
by
either
state
which
might
coerce
the
commission
in
its
effort
to
eliminate
evil
conditions
in
an
area
where
there
is
an
extensive
activity
in
international
and
inter-state
commerce,
and
it
goes
on
in
following
paragraph,
“if
at
defendant's
content
a
witness
may
claim
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
with
respect
to
federal
clients
notwithstanding
a
conferral
of
bi-state
immunity
by
the
commission,
it
would
follow
that
there
could
no
effective
investigation
not
only
of
the
state
aspects
of
such
crimes,
but
even
of
the
non
criminal
aspects
of
waterfront
commission
since
possible
federal
criminal
overturned
are
frequently
present.
this
is
so
because
of
the
nature
of
the
waterfront
activity
and
its
consistent
involvement
with
interstate
commerce
and
other
such
areas
of
federal
jurisdiction.
since
the
commission
cannot
grant
immunity
as
to
the
federal
crimes,
it
will
remain
helpless.”
then
the
court
goes
in
a
footnote
and
this
is
most
interesting,
the
court
recognizes,
our
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
recognized
that
there
was
incrimination
here,
as
far
as
federal
verdict.
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
whether
or
not
the
hobbs
act
was
urged
and
the
hobbs
act
was
set
forth
as
one
of
the
crimes,
in
fact
it
appears
in
our
papers.
every
one
of
the
events
that
appears
in
our
brief
in
this
court
were
cited
in
the
trial
court
as
the
reasons
of
throwing
incrimination,
not
alone
the
testimony
but
a
record
was
given
to
the
court
and
made
part
of
the
record,
the
setting
forth,
the
various
crimes
that
could
be
involved.
now
here
is
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
their
opinion.
of
course
recognizing
the
situation
of
federal
incrimination
here,
supreme
court
recognized
that
clearly,
in
fact
it
refused
to
give
us
discovery
before
isn't
it,
upheld
the
refusal
and
then
went
on
to
say,
of
course
it
is
not
for
us
to
say
whether
the
conditions
grant
of
immunity
would
be
honored
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding
in
feldman
versus
united
states.
it
was
held
by
a
four
to
three
vote,
that
testimony
defendant
previously
compelled
on
the
sanctions
of
a
state
immunity
statute,
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
federal
prosecution.
if
feldman
were
overruled
as
they
compelled
testimony
held
inadmissible
in
the
federal
court,
a
witness
would
be
free
to
testify
under
the
state
immunity
grant
and
so
forth.
now
might
i
say
this
to
this
court?
in
examining
the
briefs
as
submitted
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
what
they
have
said
in
their
brief
and
may
i
quote
them
from
page
45,
“thus
this
court
believes
that
the
petitioners
must
by
protected
against
federal
incrimination.”
there
is
a
recognition.
there
was
a
recognition
from
the
day
it
appeared
on
october
3rd,
at
the
time
there
were
fresh
from
contempt
--
of
contempt
on
october
4th.
on
october
27th
when
they
again
report
back,
there
was
a
constant
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
could
be
and
would
probably
be
and
i
use
in
this
instance
probability,
not
possibility,
probability,
because
in
this
instance
because
of
the
crime
that
was
being
investigated
and
the
thing
that
was
going
on
at
that
particular
moment,
that
they
were
investigating
and
they
say
in
their
brief
that
testimony
maybe
compelled
and
the
court
should
hold
in
this
case
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits,
here
is
what
the
respondent
says,
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
directly
or
indirectly
of
petitioner's
testimony
in
any
federal
proceeding,
such
a
decision
involves
of
course
overruling
of
feldman
and
then
they
go
on
to
indicate
that
the
feldman
should
be
overruled
that's
why
my
opponent's
arguments
today
shocks
me
a
little
bit,
and
use
that
brief
in
which
they
recognize
and
say
that
feldman
should
be
overruled.
now
we
respectfully
submit
in
our
reply
brief
here,
based
upon
their
brief
that
they
submitted,
where
they
contend
that
the
fifth
amendment
probably
applies
and
the
feldman
should
be
overruled.
we
say
if
that
is
solved
taking
their
argument
as
given
to
this
court,
and
this
court
only
goes
to
the
extent
--
however
we
say
that
this
court
should
based
on
overrule
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
but
if
they
say,
in
their
argument
that
sufficient
if
you
overrule
feldman
versus
united
states,
that
will
take
care
of
the
situation,
that
will
complete
it
and
protect
these
people,
then
we
say
we
should
a
reversal
in
this
case,
no
question
about
that,
due
process
requires
that,
when
we
were
faced
with
the
obligation
of
making
a
determination
we
were
faced
with
the
law
as
it
stood.
the
