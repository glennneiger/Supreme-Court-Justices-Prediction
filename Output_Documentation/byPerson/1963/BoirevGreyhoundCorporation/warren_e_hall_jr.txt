mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
respond
to
a
few
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
posed
to
counsel
for
the
government
to
explain
a
little
bit
further
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
the
first
instance,
the
inquiry,
mr.
justice,
with
reference
to
the
record
before
the
court,
there
was
no
point
in
there
being
a
record
before
the
court
because
this
was
not
an
action
to
review
a
finding
of
the
board.
this
was
an
action
to
vacate
an
--
an
act
unlawfully
taken
by
the
national
labor
relation
board.
i
will
elucidate
on
that
in
a
minute.
but
in
this
case
the
petition
--
the
direction
of
election
which
was
attached
to
the
complaint
which
was
the
only
thing
before
the
court
besides
certain
affidavits
and
other
attachments
to
the
complaint,
showed
on
its
face
that
the
board
had
made
finding
of
fact
which
as
a
matter
of
law
required
under
the
expressed
congressional
intent
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947.
the
board
had
made
a
finding
which
it
was
prohibited
from
making
as
expressly
as
did
the
board
make
in
its
error
of
statutory
construction
in
the
kyne
case.
the
history
of
the
case
goes
a
little
bit
further
than
behind
the
date
of
the
petition
for
an
election
in
this
case.
attached
to
--
and
also
attached
to
the
complaint
and
made
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
is
also
a
finding
--
a
set
of
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
judge
for
the
then
southern
district
of
florida,
now
middle
district
of
florida,
wherein
when
this
contract
came
up
in
1954,
not
just
1960
when
the
petition
for
election
was
filed,
in
1954,
the
--
the
employer
told
the
union
that
it
was
going
to
format
this
work
to
an
independent
contract.
the
union
said
that
if
you
do
--
and
this
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
union
said,
"if
you
do,
we
will
have
a
system-wide
strike
which
will
continue
until
you
breach
your
contract
with
the
pro
--
proposed
independent
contract."
therefore,
rather
than
experiencing
that,
the
union
and
the
employer
agreed
to
forbade
either
putting
the
contract
into
effect
or
to
instigating
a
strike
until
a
declaratory
judgment
complaint
was
filed
with
the
district
court
and
resolved.
such
declaratory
judgment
complaint
was
filed
with
judge
simpson.
he
made
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law,
including
that
this
was
a
contract
established
in
an
independent
contract
to
employee-employment
relationship
rather
than
an
employer-employee
relationship,
insofar
as
greyhound
and
floors
were
concerned,
and
that
the
company
was
not
violating
this
contract
by
forming
this
workout.
so
those
matters,
mr.
justice
goldberg
would
--
were
determined
some
five
years
prior
to
the
initiation
of
the
petition
for
--
for
election
in
this
case.
now,
we
have
much
of
and
we
live
much
with
legislative
histories,
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
call
the
court's
attention
what
the
legislative
hence
--
history
as
of
the
time
of
this
case,
as
of
the
present
time,
really
is.
the
early
legislative
history,
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
pointed
out
quite
correctly,
arose
in
the
enactment
--
the
preparation
for
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act
in
1935
because
of
this
court's
declaring
the
section
(7)
(a)
of
the
industrial
recovery
act
and
public
resolution
44
implementing
that
act
unconstitutional.
in
the
history
of
that
act,
the
legislative
history
the
--
of
the
wagner
act,
it
was
pointed
out
and
quite
correctly,
that
the
--
that
resolution
44
under
which
the
government
had
theretofore
proceed,
had
permitted
anyone
aggrieved
by
any
order
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
to
go
to
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
united
states
and
obtain
relief.
and
that
the
history
had
been
up
to
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act
that
employers
did
frequently
go,
more
often
than
not,
take
a
direct
review
prior
to
any
further
administrative
proceedings
and
that
that
was
bad,
that
the
national
labor
policy
was
not
properly
being
implemented.
so
to
correct
that
situation,
the
legislative
history
is
full
of
language
referring
to
employers
and
employers
seeking
an
injunction
but
not
one
bit
of
all
that
legislative
history
refers
to
employers
as
distinguished
from
--
from
unions
only
because
it
was
not
until
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
that
unions
and
employers
had
comparable
responsibilities
and
duties
under
the
act.
therefore,
their
effort
to
distinguish
between
the
right
of
an
employer,
on
the
one
hand,
to
go
to
a
district
court,
if
there'd
be
such
a
right
in
anyone,
as
against
that
of
a
union
is
not
a
valid
distinction.
there
is
no
legislative
history,
let
me
say,
that
establishes
that
as
a
valid
distinction.
the
early
cases
which
came
before
this
court
on
this
subject
matter
and
with
regard
to
which
this
court
withheld
jurisdiction
to
act,
withheld
the
question
until
the
leedom
v.
kyne
case.
did
not
decide
this
question
nor
did
any
decision
of
this
court
at
any
time
ever
hold
that
action
of
an
administrative
agency,
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
administrative
authority,
that
is
within
the
confines
of
the
authority
and
powers
vested
in
any
such
agency
by
congress.
at
no
time
had
this
court
ever
held
that
that
was
not
judicial
--
judicially
subject
to
a
complaint
of
petition
to
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
under
the
judicial
code
on
its
general
powers
of
equity
to
review
an
act
taken
up
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
and
to
obtain
relief
if
that
were
contrary
to
a
statute.
now,
when
we
got
into
the
actual
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947,
and
you,
legislative
history,
may
it
please
the
court,
began
to
take
place.
we
began
for
the
first
time
to
subject
unions
to
the
same
sort
of
responsibility
in
their
acts
as
employers
that
they
have
theretofore
been
subjected
to
under
the
wagner
act,
did
more
than
that.
a
lot
of
this
--
a
lot
of
this
legislative
history
that
predates
the
taft-hartley
act
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
wagner
act
said
that
the
authority
to
enforce
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
was
exclusively
within
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that's
in
10
(a)
of
the
wagner
act
and
10
(a)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
effective
august
23,
1947.
the
language
was
intentionally
stricken
by
the
congress
to
remove
the
implication
that
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now,
the
court
--
the
taft-hartley
act
did
two
of
the
very
important
things
which
as
i
say,
do
violence,
if
not
destroy
a
lot
of
the
previous
legislative
history
with
regard
to
judicial
review.
first,
the
only
--
the
early
cases,
including
the
myers
case,
the
first
one
in
1938,
myers
versus
bethlehem
shipbuilding
corporation,
expressly
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
--
whoever
was
involved,
be
it
an
employer
or
a
union,
had
adequate
judicial
recourse
by
commitment
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
going
through
the
entire
tortures
proceeding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
then
having
the
case
reviewed
prior
to
being
made
to
do
anything.
now
the
taft-hartley
act
stopped
that.
the
taft-hartley
act
included
a
new
section
known
as
section
10
(j).
and
section
10
(j)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
says
--
says,
"prior
to
a
hearing,
at
any
time
when
the
board
has
issued
a
complaint
that
a
--
an
employer
or
a
union
has
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
board
may
go
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
obtain
an
injunction."
and
the
court
--
and
the
board
and
the
courts
have
repeatedly
granted
injunctions,
compelling
both
unions
and
employers
to
bargain
before
any
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
ever
had
a
shot
at
that
--
to
review
such
an
action.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
making
that
contention.
to
the
contrary,
i'd
say
that
this
would
apply
to
only
the
most
exceptional
case
where
on
the
face
of
the
direction
of
election,
it
showed
that
the
board
had
acted
beyond
its
authority
and
without
statutory
power.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
the
board
found
facts
which
compel
a
legal
conclusion
that
these
employees
were
not
the
employees
of
the
respondent
here
but
the
employees
of
someone
else.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
understand,
mr.
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice,
it
does
not.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
--
i
--
i
disagree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
because
there's
a
contrary
finding
which
does
--
that
--
that
does
not
offset
earlier
in
the
opinion
and
direction
of
election.
first,
whatever
control
that
the
board
finds,
and
they
only
find
by
way
of
conclusion
that
there
was
control
in
greyhound
over
these
employees
of
floors,
they
first
found
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
agree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
agree,
mr.
justice,
with
each
of
the
findings
there
as
being
even
more
than
conclusions.
but
that
as
the
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
--
i
mean
of
congressional
proscription
against
the
board,
that
one
cannot
be
an
employer
of
employees
with
regard
to
whom
he
cannot
have,
pay,
discipline,
transfer,
promote,
discharge,
etcetera,
which
the
board
made
a
specific
finding
with
regard
to
floors,
inc.
and
not
to
greyhound.
these
other
elements
are
quo
--
are
controlled
--
are
elements
of
control
which
are
insufficient
to
establish
the
control
necessary
to
be
an
employer
with
regard
to
employees
over
whom
someone
else
exercises
these
basic
controls
without
--
without
for
instance
the
power
to
discharge,
one
cannot
bargain
with
regards
to
those
things
which
are
covered
by
section
9
(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
as
a
---
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
do,
mr.
justice.
and
i
say
that
not
just
because
of
the
general
law
with
regard
to
what
constitutes
an
employer-employee
relationship.
i
say
it
with
specific
regard
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
--
to
the
enactment
or
adoption
of
section
2
and
3
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
that
legislative
history
is
set
forth
in
pages
10
and
11
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
that
legislative
history
says
it
believes
that
the
national
labor
board
and
this
court,
in
the
herz
case
way
back
in
222
u.s.,
had
this
court
relying
upon
the
board's
alleged
expertise,
had
defined
an
employee
to
be
someone
who
was
not
in
fact
an
employee.
what
the
board
had
done
and
what
it
has
done
for
sometime
before
was
to
consider
economic
and
social
purposes
as
governing
the
question
of
the
employment
relationship
for
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
congress
changed
the
act
in
1947
and
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it's
expressly
intended
and
directed
to
congress
--
the
board
to
not
thereafter
call
someone
who
is
an
employee
--
who
was
not
an
employee
within
the
concepts
described
in
the
very
legislative
history,
namely
that
one
who
works
for
another
for
hire.
together
with
the
elements
of
control
which
show
an
employment
relationship,
not
an
employment
relationship
for
general
purposes
necessarily
but
the
employment
relationship
necessary
to
bargain,
which
is
the
ultimate,
to
bargain
with
regard
to
wages,
working
conditions,
hours
of
employment,
etcetera.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
and
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
in
a
number
of
ways,
mr.
justice.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
say
the
record
reflects
in
this
case
that
if
the
--
if
a
--
my
client
were
not
protected
by
an
order
of
the
court
that
says
he
is
not
the
employer
in
the
case,
he
would
be
the
employer.
and
his
right
to
not
be
an
employer
came
into
being
the
instant
that
the
board
granted
this
decision
of
direction
of
election.
therefore,
he
went
to
the
court
the
very
earliest
time
that
right
came
into
being.
he
destroys
--
destroyed
that
right.
the
history
in
the
record
of
this
case
shows
that
the
union
would
probably
more
than
--
probably,
rather
than
probably
not
because
of
their
threats
existing
when
the
employee
--
when
the
court
held
that
the
employer
was
not
the
employer.
that
they
would
then
go
into
a
system-wide
strike
and
shut
him
down.
now,
i
would
like
to
buttress
that
with
one
further
argument
along
that
line
and
that
is
the
simple
fact
that
what
does
happen,
we
have
all
of
these
legislative
--
legislative
history
and
all
these
rules
of
probability
and
possibility.
what
happened
in
this
case
for
instance?
there
certainly
no
labor
strife
that
arose
from
the
granting
of
this
injunction.
that
was
the
thing
that
has
caused
this
court
to
act
very
cautiously
in
this
field
of
jurisdiction.
secondly,
and
adverting
again
to
jurisdiction,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
from
its
very
inception,
including
the
old
ria.
the
legislative
history
was
related
to
the
congress'
desire
that
these
actions
of
the
administrative
agency
not
be
reviewed,
where?
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals.
not
one
bit
of
it
is
addressed
to
the
right
of
the
united
states
district
court
acting
under
the
authority
and
the
only
authority
they
have
and
that
is
that
which
is
granted
to
them
by
the
congress
to
vacate
any
order
which
is
found
--
has
been
made
in
excess
of
legislative
power,
which
is
precisely
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case.
there
were
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
if
the
union
had
struck,
mr.
justice,
in
this
case,
in
a
case
where
the
--
where
greyhound
was
not
the
employer,
the
union
would
have
been
violating
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
act
automatically.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
they
had
a
right
to
strike
the
contract.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
they
could
still
strike
the
contract.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
the
--
the
union
which
did
not
represent
them
would've
respected
their
picket
line
or
not.
that's
speculative.
but
one
further
characterization
of
the
relationship
here
which
i
think
is
extremely
important.
what
is
the
nature
of
floors
incorporated,
the
independent
contractor
in
this
case?
as
the
briefs
pointed
out,
as
the
records
point
out,
this
is
an
organization,
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
cleanup
and
related
types
of
business
including
the
repair
of
vehicles
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it's
engaged
generally
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
actually
engaged
in
the
cleanup
under
a
contract
in
the
federal
building
both
in
--
in
jacksonville
and
in
--
in
tampa,
where
we
tried
this
case
once
before
the
fifth
circuit
and
once
before
the
district
court.
these
--
these
people
rotate
these
employees.
that's
why
it's
most
important
that
there
is
a
finding
by
the
board
that
they
transfer
them.
that
means
they
transfer
them
to
work
all
over
everywhere.
these
people
do
not
work
just
for
greyhound.
these
people
are
transferred.
these
people
represented
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
less
than
6%
of
the
total
employment
of
floors'
employees
in
each
of
the
four
areas
described
without
regard
to
any
other
areas.
therefore,
we
get
to
the
real
point
is
that,
why
was
greyhound
ever
named
in
this
case
as
an
employer?
no.
it
was
named
as
a
practical
problem.
first
--
first,
the
union
filed
a
petition
for
election
in
which
it
named
floors,
inc.
as
its
employee
--
employer
and
setup
the
same
proposed
unit,
jacksonville,
miami,
st.
petersburg,
and
tampa.
those
--
those
employees
of
floors
working
at
greyhound's
terminal
but
they
named
floors
as
the
employer.
well,
of
course,
it
was
not
an
appropriate
unit.
they
could
never
have
gotten
any.
mr.
justice
berg
--
goldberg
will
understand
that
completely.
it
was
an
inappropriate
unit.
they
could
not
have
gotten
an
election
order
under
those
circumstances.
therefore,
in
order
to
get
an
election
or
attempt
to
get
an
election
over
employees
whom
they
could
not
otherwise
represent,
they
brought
in
greyhound,
called
greyhound
a
joint
employer.
and
greyhound,
on
the
very
face
of
the
board's
decision
and
directly
i
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
not
an
employer.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
was
stopped
because
of
the
light,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
i
will
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
this
is
about
--
of
what
--
of
how
this
case
fits
into
the
theory
of
the
doctrine
of
the
case
of
leedom
versus
kyne
is
most
important.
we
say
that
without
the
leedom
--
with
the
kyne
case,
without
that,
because
of
general
principles
of
equity
in
--
in
the
united
states
district
courts,
as
recognized,
this
court
--
by
this
court
all
the
way
back
and
i'll
do
as
one
of
the
earlier
counts
that
did
refer
back
all
the
way
to
marbury
versus
madison.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
in
my
brief.
but
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
the
current
case
was
predicated
upon
at
least
six
of
the
identical
facts
which
--
or
situations
which
exist
here.
first,
the
board's
action
was
contrary
to
statute,
and
it
was
just
as
contrary
to
statute
as
it
was
in
kyne
case,
and
in
direct
conflict
with
an
expressed
statutory
prohibition
which
the
legislature
had
reflected
in
amending
the
definitive
section
of
employee.
it
was
not
an
action
for
review,
as
was
the
case
in
--
neither
in
kyne
or
in
this
case
wasn't
an
action
for
a
rule
--
a
review.
it
was
an
action
set
aside
acts
taken
by
an
agency
in
excess
of
statutory
authority.
in
both
cases,
the
board
exercised
powers
which
the
congress
had
specifically
withheld.
and
that's
reflected
in
the
legislative
history.
in
both
cases,
the
rights
of
the
parties
were
adversely
affected
by
the
act
of
the
government.
and
if
one
is
deprived
of
a
right
granted
by
a
statute,
he
is
per
se,
may
it
please
the
court,
damaged,
and
this
court
so
held
in
leedom
versus
kyne.
this
employer
had
no
more
and
no
less
recourse
to
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
and
the
section
9
review
proceedings
then
did
the
union
in
kind.
they
both
had
exactly
the
same
rights
and
they
both
have
exactly
the
same
rights.
there
is
no
basis,
whatsoever,
upon
which
to
distinguish
between
the
status
of
an
employer
and
the
status
of
a
union
in
this
case.
you
--
probability
is
merely
probability.
the
fact
is
that
the
union,
and
as
the
board
contended
in
its
brief
in
kind,
which
we've
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
the
board
contended
there,
and
they
contended
strongly,
that
the
union
had
recourse
elsewhere,
but
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
they
had
recourse
on
the
unfair
labor
act
proceeding.
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
the
respondent
here,
what
i'm
doing,
my
client
is
doing
here,
is
not
to
try
to
enlarge
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
the
kyne
case.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
mr.
justice,
nor,
as
a
matter
of
the
legislative
history
as
to
what
employment
is.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
violation
right
on
the
face
of
this
order
which
is
a
violation
of
an
expressed
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
may
--
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
e.
hall,
jr.
may
--
may
i,
mr.
justice
brennan,
simply
say
this,
and
my
contention
why
it
is
directly
in
violation
of
the
statute.
when
read
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history,
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
in
taking
everything
that
the
board
said,
both
pros
and
cons,
there
is
not
an
employment
relationship
between
greyhound
and
the
employees
of
floors,
either
joint
or
otherwise.
thank
you
for
your
indulgence.
