mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
sustained
an
injunction
issued
against
a
representation
election
directed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
federal
district
court,
under
its
general
equity
power
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
board
representation
election
at
the
suit
of
an
employer
who
challenges
its
validity.
now
the
underlying
facts
are
briefly
these.
in
april
of
1961,
the
amalgamated
association
of
street,
electric
railway
and
motor
coach
employees
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
pursuant
to
section
9
(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
requesting
a
representation
election
among
the
porters,
janitors,
and
maids
working
at
four
bus
terminals
in
florida
operated
by
respondent
greyhound.
the
employees
were
on
the
payroll
of
floors,
a
cleaning
and
maintenance
service
company
which
was
under
contract
with
greyhound
to
provide
such
service
at
the
four
greyhound
terminals.
the
union
contented
that
greyhound
was
a
joint
employer
of
the
employees,
along
with
floors
and
requested
a
single
bargaining
unit
composed
of
the
employees
at
the
four
terminals.
greyhound
and
floors
on
the
other
hand,
contented
that
floors
was
the
sole
employer
of
the
employees.
after
hearing,
the
board
found
that
while
floors
hires,
pays,
disciplines,
transfers,
and
promotes
the
porters,
janitors,
and
maids,
greyhound
exercised
sufficient
common
control
over
their
working
conditions
as
to
be
their
joint
employer
along
with
floors.
it
further
found
that
a
single
unit
consisting
of
all
the
employees
under
the
joint
employer
relationship
was
appropriate.
accordingly,
it
directed
that
an
election
be
held
in
this
unit
to
determine
whether
the
employees
desired
to
be
represented
by
the
union
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
greyhound,
contending
that
it
was
not
the
employer
of
the
employees
concerned
and
thus,
that
it
had
illegally
been
made
a
party
to
the
representation
proceeding,
brought
this
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
to
enjoin
the
election.
the
district
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
after
hearing
was
converted
into
a
permanent
injunction.
it
predicated
this
action
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
leedom
versus
kyne
which
recognized
district
court
jurisdiction
in
what
i
shall
try
to
show
later
is
a
very
limited
situation,
totally
distinguishable
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
the
board
appealed
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
we
submit,
briefly
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
erroneous,
that
the
statutory
review
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
submit
a
--
provides
an
adequate
way
by
which
greyhound
could
have
had
its
contentions
reviewed
and
it
was
congress'
intention
that
that
would
be
the
exclusive
procedure
by
which
those
contentions
could
be
reviewed.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
the
exception
recognized
in
leedom
against
kyne
is
not
applicable
here.
now
let
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
district
court,
your
honor,
did
not
have
before
it
the
record
of
the
board
proceeding.
it
went
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
filed
by
greyhound
which,
attached
to
it,
the
board's
decision
without
the
underlying
evidentiary
basis
for
the
board
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
we
submit
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
as
i
will
try
to
the
--
try
to
develop,
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
review,
at
the
suit
of
an
employer,
a
board
direction
of
election
no
matter
what
the
allegation
is
as
to
the
basis
of
what
are
the
board's
action.
furthermore,
there
is
no
--
since
an
election
is
involved
which
imposes
no
irreparable
injury,
there
isn't
a
case
for
equitable
relief
apart
from
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
now,
kyne
versus
leedom
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
a
labor
union
which
was
challenging
not
an
election
but
a
certification
and
which
did
not
have
the
adequate
remedy
that
the
employer
has
opened
to
it
that
there
was
jurisdiction
where
it
appeared
that
the
board
violated
a
clear
provision
of
the
statute.
now,
we
don't
think
that
you
reached
that
exception
with
respect
to
a
situation
where
you
have,
first
of
all,
a
challenge
to
an
election
and,
secondly,
a
person
like
an
employer
that
has
an
adequate
remedy
under
the
statute.
but,
our
third
ground
for
distinguishing
kyne
against
leedom,
if
it
is
necessary
to
reach
it
is
that
unlike
kyne
against
leedom,
this
is
not
a
case
where
it
is
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
and
the
exhibits
attached
to
it
which
includes
the
board's
decision
and
order
that
the
board
has
acted
plainly
contrary
to
the
statute.
and
therefore
to
that
limited
extent,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
look
at
the
basis
for
the
board's
action,
but
the
merits
are
not
here
in
the
sense
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
review
the
entire
evidentiary
basis
for
the
board's
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
not
too
much
argument.
i
think
that
the
board
record
develops
them
in
much
greater
details
than
the
board
has
set
them
out
in
its
--
in
its
decision.
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
same
employees
that
floors
are
using
used
to
be
greyhound's
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
so,
that
this
is
what
--
at
--
at
best,
one
of
these
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
where
--
in
order
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
board's
decision,
you
got
to
look
at
the
full
record.
it
isn't
a
case
like
kyne
against
leedom
where
it
was
open
and
shot
that
you
had
a
specific
statutory
provision
involved
that
the
board
had
been
violating.
i
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
statutory
scheme
which
this
court
is
familiar
with.
sections
10
(e)
and
(f)
of
the
act
provide
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
a
final
order
of
the
board
which
this
court
has
interpreted
to
mean
an
order
entered
at
the
culmination
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
under
section
10.
section
9
(d)
of
the
act
provides
for
review
of
a
representation
case
only
when
it
forms
the
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
order
and
that
order
is
itself
before
the
court
for
review
under
section
10
(e)
and
(f).
now,
what
does
this
mean
in
terms
of
this
case?
it
means
this.
that
greyhound
could
have
had
its
contentions
respecting
the
invalidity
of
the
election
reviewed
under
the
statutory
procedure.
what
it
could
have
done
is
it
could
have
proceeded
to
an
election.
if
the
union
lost
the
election,
there's
no
injury
to
greyhound.
if
the
union
won
and
were
certified,
greyhound
could
have
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
ground
that
the
certification
was
invalid
because
greyhound
was
not
an
employer
of
the
employees
involved.
this
would
have
subjected
greyhound
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
alleging
that
it
had
refused
the
bargain
in
violation
of
the
section
8
(a)
(5).
and
were
the
charge
sustained
in
an
order
compelling
bargaining
issued,
greyhound
could
have
obtained
review
of
the
bargaining
order
and
the
underlying
certification
under
sections
10
(e)
or
(f)
of
the
act.
now,
it
couldn't
be
plainer,
we
submit,
that
congress
intended
that
this
would
be
the
exclusive
means
by
which
an
employer
like
greyhound
could
obtain
review
of
a
board
direction
of
a
representation
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
think,
yes,
your
honor.
however,
this
is
not
such
a
case,
as
i've
indicated
before.
public
resolution
44
which
created
the
first
national
labor
relations
board
to
administer
section
7
(a)
of
the
nra
provided
for
immediate
judicial
review
of
board
orders
and
representation
proceedings
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
experience
showed
that
the
employers
took
advantage
of
such
a
broad
review
provision
that
contest
orders
directing
elections
and
virtually
every
case
in
which
the
board
had
directed
one,
thereby
delaying
the
commencement
of
collective
bargaining.
the
senate
report
on
the
wagner
act
well-aware
of
the
experience
under
the
nra
pointed
out,
and
i'm
quoting
from
a
passage
that's
in
our
brief,
that
after
almost
a
year,
not
a
single
case
in
which
a
company
has
chosen
to
contest
an
election
order
of
the
board
has
reached
decision
in
any
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
in
the
house
report
further
pointed
out
that
the
abilities
of
employers
to
block
elections
had
been
productive
of
a
large
major
of
industrial
strike.
what
had
happened
was
that
the
union
had
build
up
employee
support
and
with
the
delay
in
proceeding
to
an
election,
that
strength
had
been
worn
away
and
the
result
was
that
they
had
to
strike
in
order
to
try
to
maintain
their
position.
now,
in
the
wagner
act,
congress
sought
to
avoid
this
problem
by
providing
in
section
9
(d)
for
this
indirect
review
of
representation
proceedings
that
i
had
outlined
before.
and,
a
senate
memorandum,
which
is
in
our
brief,
comparing
the
previous
arrangement
with
the
wagner
act
provision,
pointed
out
that
section
9
(d)
is
a
new
provision
intended
to
make
it
clearer
that
when
the
board
orders
an
election,
persons
affected
by
that
order
cannot
come
into
court
until
after
the
election
has
been
held.
and
this
is
where
a
theme
is
repeated
time
and
time
again
in
the
legislative
debates,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
full
in
our
brief.
and
the
history
doesn't
stop
there
because,
in
1947,
when
congress
was
enacting
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
the
hartley
bill
contained
a
provision
which
would
have
permitted
direct
review
of
representation
determinations,
not
at
an
election
stage
as
here,
but
at
least
at
the
certification
stage.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
was
that
the
employer,
and
these
are
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
here
relies
on
for
finding
an
exception
for
district
court
review,
could
obtain
review
under
the
statutory
procedure
only
by
cumbersome
proceedings
that
always
involve
the
risk
of
a
strike
and
a
--
and
a
finding
that
the
employer
by
following
the
statutory
course
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
notwithstanding
that,
congress,
in
conference,
deleted
this
provision,
keeping
9
(d)
as
it
was
under
the
wagner
act
and
senator
taft,
explaining
the
deletion,
pointed
out
that
other
--
that
the
house
provision
would
have
permitted
dilatory
tactics
in
representation
proceedings.
the
nub
of
this
is,
we
submit,
that
to
permit
greyhound
to
obtain
district
court
review
in
the
situation
here
is
the
sanction
precisely
what
congress
sought
to
avoid.
now,
what
has
come
to
kyne
against
leedom,
which
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
recognized
an
exception
to
the
general
preclusion
of
district
court
review
of
board
representation
proceedings
and
the
case
last
term,
sociedad,
which
recognized
a
further
situation
for
district
court
review.
although
the
court
took
great
pains,
we
submit
to
emphasize
that
it
was
not
impending
thereby
to
open
up
the
very
limited
exception
that
kyne
had
--
had
created.
the
situation
in
kyne
was
this.
the
union
won
a
board
election
in
a
unit
consisting
of
233
professional
and
9
non-professional
employees,
and
was
certified
as
the
representative
in
that
unit.
you
had
the
election,
you
had
the
certification.
after
the
certification
issue,
the
union
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
certification
on
the
ground
that
the
nine
professionals
had
been
included
in
the
unit
without
the
professionals
first
having
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
separately
on
the
question
of
whether
they
wanted
them
in
unit.
it
was
alleged
that
this
was
contrary
to
section
9
(b)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
professional
and
non-professional
employees
shall
not
be
included
in
the
same
unit
unless
the
majority
of
the
professionals'
vote
were
such
included.
in
other
words,
you
had
a
very
narrow
provision
that
seemed
to
be
very
specific
and
it
seemed
like
the
board
had
very
clearly
violated
it.
this
court
found
that
the
board's
action
was
plainly
in
excess
of
its
delegated
powers
and
contrary
to
a
specific
prohibition
in
the
act.
but
the
court
didn't
stop
there,
we
submit,
as
we
read
its
opinion.
it
further
pointed
out
that
such
unlawful
action
had
inflicted
an
injury
on
the
professional
employees
because
the
election
had
already
been
held
and
the
certification
it
issued.
and
that
this
we
believe
is
significant,
at
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
would
mean,
and
now
i'm
quoting
from
the
opinion,
"a
sacrifice
or
obliteration
of
a
right
to
which
congress
has
given
professional
employees
where
there
is
no
other
means
within
their
control
to
protect
and
enforce
that
right."
the
court
held
that,
in
those
circumstances,
it
could
not
be
inferred
that
congress
had
intended
to
foreclose
a
judicial
remedy.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
this
court
only
last
term
in
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
was
who,
your
honor?
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union
representing
them
was
seeking
this
pure
unit
that
would
be
restricted
only
to
professional
employees.
now,
there
was
no
dependable
way
on
which
they
could
have
gotten
their
contention
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
unit
reviewed
under
the
statutory
review
proceeding
for
this
reason.
though
they
were
certified,
they,
unlike
the
typical
union
that
is
aggrieved
by
a
representation
determination
and
loses
an
election,
were
in
a
position
where
theoretically
they
could
have
insisted
that
the
employer
that
they
would
bargain
only
for
the
233
professionals
and
they
wouldn't
bargain
for
the
9
professionals.
but,
in
that
situation
unlike
the
case
that
--
the
traditional
case
of
the
employer,
the
chances
of
a
charge
being
filed
against
the
professional
union
for
refusing
the
bargain
were
slim,
if
not
indeed,
largely
academic
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
kyne
case,
we
made
the
argument
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
we
thought
that
the
union
in
kyne
was
in
a
position
where
it
could
have
availed
itself
of
the
statutory
review
procedure
because
theoretically
possible,
it
was
possible
that
a
refusal
of
bargain
charge
could
have
been
filed
against
that
union.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
kyne
case
found
and
we
believe
that
this
court
accepted
that
finding
in
affirming
the
court
of
appeals,
that
in
the
circumstances
presented
in
kyne,
the
statutory
review
procedure
was
not
as
dependable
and
as
reliable
as
is
the
statutory
review
procedure
for
the
case
of
the
employer
in
the
situation
here
for
the
reason
that,
if
the
professional
union
refuse
to
bargain
except
in
a
union
--
in
a
unit
which
was
different
from
the
unit
certified
by
the
board,
it
was
most
unlikely
that
the
employer
would
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
that
union.
it
was
much
more
likely,
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
the
employer
would
be
content
or
just
not
bargain
at
all
as
he
was
free
to
do
prior
to
the
board
certification
because
the
employer
could
hardly
be
subjected
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
his
part
for
refusing
the
bargain
in
the
unit
other
than
the
one
that
the
board
had
certified.
secondly,
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
nine
non-professionals
could
have
filed
a
charge
against
the
professional
union
for
refusing
to
bargain
on
their
behalf,
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
that
was
very
remote
and
unlikely
in
view
of
the
fact
that
these
nine
represented
such
a
minority
in
the
total
picture
that
they
would
not
be
wanting
to
jeopardize
the
already
bad
relations
that
they
had
with
the
professional
union.
now,
the
case
of
the
employer,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
is
totally
different.
it's
not
only
different
analytically,
but
experience
has
shown
that
it's
different.
namely,
a
union
is
in
the
business
of
--
of
representing
employees
of
that
union
is
certified
for
a
particular
group
of
employees
and
the
employer
refuses
to
bargain,
it
is
virtually
inevitable
that
that
union
will
file
a
charge
with
the
board
alleging
a
refusal
of
bargain
and
experien
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
union
could
--
the
union
could
strike,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that,
in
the
first
place,
if
it
strikes,
it's
virtually
as
likely
as
it
was
in
the
case
that
i
heard
earlier
today
that
the
union
is
going
to
couple
that
up
with
a
refusal
to
bargain
charge
because
if
it
doesn't
do
that,
it's
going
to
jeopardize
the
status
of
these
strikers.
they
would
be
only
economic
strikers
who
would
be
subject
to
replacement.
furthermore,
the
union
might
get
into
some
problems
under
8
(b)
(7)
which
limits
the
time
that
you
can
strike-picket
for
recognition
if
you
haven't
gotten
an
unfair
labor
practice
writing.
secondly,
the
fact
--
whether
or
not
the
union
gets
review
at
the
district
--
or
whether
not
the
employer
gets
a
review
at
the
district
court
or
not
of
the
board's
representation
determination
is
not
going
to
avoid
the
likelihood
of
a
strike
because
the
setting
aside
of
the
representation
determination
is
not
going
to
preclude
the
union
from
striking.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
congress'
judgment
that
the
chances
of
getting
a
strike
were
much
more
likely
if
you
bottled
up
the
representation
proceeding
at
the
election
stage
and
let
things
drag
for
two
to
three
years
before
you
get
that
resolved
and
then
look
at
the
situation
that
you
have.
if
ultimately,
the
board
is
to
prevail,
the
employer
gets
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
because
he
still
cannot
be
ordered
to
do
anything
until
the
board
issues
a
bargaining
order
and
then
we
got
to
go
back
up
to
the
statutory
procedure.
and
i
leave
on
this
note.
senator
wagner,
in
the
course
of
the
debates
in
the
wagner
act,
pointed
out
that
the
act
here
does
not
stoop
to
the
following
of
having
the
board
fall
in
the
court
twice,
once
before
the
election
and
then
a
second
time
after
the
election.
and
that
is
precisely
what
would
happen
under
the
situation
that
we
have
in
--
in
this
case.
and
for
the
reasons
indicated,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
norton
j.
come
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
don't
have
anything
further
to
add.
