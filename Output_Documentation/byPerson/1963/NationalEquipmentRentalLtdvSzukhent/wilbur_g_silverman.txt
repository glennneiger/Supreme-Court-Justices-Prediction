mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
on
certiorari
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
the
second
circuit
affirming
an
order
of
the
district
court
quashing
the
service
of
process
upon
the
respondents,
the
defendants
in
the
court
below.
the
facts
are
--
i
think
without
dispute,
petitioner
is
a
delaware
corporation
whose
principal
place
of
business
is
located
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
whose
principal
business
is
that
of
purchasing
industrial
equipment
pursuant
to
its
costumer's
orders
in
order
that
it
may
lease
that
equipment
over
a
term
of
months
or
years
to
that
lessee.
in
accordance
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no
sir.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
it's
a
straight
lease.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well
the
terms
vary
in
accordance
with
the
desires
of
the
lessee.
in
this
instance,
i
believe
it
was
for
36
months.
the
lease
is
written
on
a
printed
form,
the
last
paragraph
of
which
provided
that
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
were
applicable
and
that
the
contract
was
deemed
to
have
been
executed
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
it
contained
the
name
of
the
designated
individual
as
a
process
agent
upon
whom
the
lessee
may
be
served
within
the
state
of
new
york.
i
might
say
that
this
paragraph
was
drafted
primarily
to
conform
with
the
provisions
of
rule
4,
subdivision
d,
subdivision
1
which
provides
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
provides
for
the
service
upon
such
a
designated
agent.
service
was
affected
on
such
agent
by
the
united
states
marshall
and
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
mrs.
weinberg.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
not
correct
judge.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
she
was
not
the
wife
of
any
of
the
principals.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
she
was
related
to
one
of
the
officers
but
not
as
a
wife.
i
think
she's
the
assistant
of
one
of
the
vice
presidents.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
lessor,
yes
sir.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no
sir.
as
the
record
discloses,
she
received
no
compensation
from
any
source.
immediately
upon
service
having
been
affected,
the
process
agent
forwarded
the
summons
of
complaint
to
the
two
defendants
and
a
register
--
a
letter
--
by
register
--
a
certified
mail
was
served
or
sent
by
the
petitioner
here
to
the
defendants
notifying
them
that
process
had
been
served
on
that
date.
a
motion
was
then
made
by
the
respondent
here
to
quash
the
service
primarily
on
the
ground
that
the
designation
of
agent
was
buried
in
fine
print
in
the
lease
and
secondarily,
on
the
ground
that
the
agent
name
was
unknown
to
these
defendants.
the
district
court
found
that
this
designation
of
agent
was
not
in
fact
a
very
fine
print
clause.
it
was
readily
apparent
and
that
prompt
and
punctilios
notice
was
given
to
the
defendants,
it
quashed
the
service
nevertheless
on
the
ground
that
that
court
felt
and
will
sustain
by
divided
court
by
the
circuit
court
that
there
should
have
been
an
inherent
provision
or
notice
to
be
given.
and
that
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
that
prompt
and
punctilios
notice
was
given
the
failure
for
--
of
the
contract
to
have
had
included
in
it
a
provision
for
a
notice,
rendered
that
portion
of
the
contract
providing
for
the
designation
of
agent
unenforceable.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no
sir.
it
was
conceded
in
the
opposing
affidavit
rather
--
rather
in
the
moving
affidavit.
now,
the
parallel
drawn
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
of
wuchter
against
pizzutti,
a
decision
of
this
court
which
rendered
invalid
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
involving
the
service
upon
the
secretary
of
state
as
an
agent
of
motorists
using
the
highways
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
wherein
no
provision
was
made
or
noticed
by
the
secretary
of
state
upon
the
proposed
defendant.
and
this
court
struck
down
that
statute
as
being
violative
of
due
process
clause
on
the
ground
that
not
withstanding
in
that
case
the
secretary
of
state
did
in
fact
notify
the
defendant
of
the
service
that
since
the
state
was
imposing
an
agency
upon
perspective
defendants
using
their
highways
it
was
incumbent
upon
that
state
to
provide
for
due
notice.
and
while
the
courts
below
recognized
the
fact
that
this
is
a
private
contract
not
inhibited
by
the
statute
or
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
with
respect
to
statutes.
they
nevertheless
drew
a
parallel
and
struck
down
this
provisional
contract.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
on
times
of
the
contract,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
were
applicable.
and
these
provisions
have
been
sustained
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
gilbert
against
burnstine
referred
to
in
my
brief,
and
has
been
followed
by
the
federal
courts.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
one
case
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
where
in
a
private
contract,
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
was
designated
as
such
process
agent
and
in
another
case
in
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
vermont
where
the
secretary
of
state
--
of
that
state
was
designated
as
a
process
agent.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
have
no
such
case
judge
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
--
because
the
leasing
industry,
if
your
honor
pleases,
is
relatively
(inaudible),
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
oddly
enough
said
they
would
have
accepted
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
says
that
no
service
or
process
need
be
made.
now
to
me
this
seems
an
enormous
anomaly
because
if
they
say
you
could
have
provided
that
no
process
need
be
served
then
why
do
they
strike
down
a
provision
which
says,
"we
designate
mrs.weinberg
or
anybody
else."
now
i
--
i
submit
if
there
were
many
instances
in
--
in
commerce
where
the
agent
designated,
and
i
say
the
word
agent
is
a
semantic
term
because
it's
merely
used
as
a
device
by
which
someone
is
named.
i
don't
think
it's
intended
to
be
used
in
the
generic
sense
of
agency
to
carry
out
large
details.
provisions
of
this
contract
specifically
provided
it
was
a
process
agent,
nothing
more.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes.
as
i
say
that's
--
i
say
that's
exactly
in
conformity
your
honor
with
the
cognovit
notes
for
example
where
it
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
confession
of
judgment,
the
right
in
the
note,
(inaudible)
permits
any
attorney
to
confess
judgment
in
any
court
in
the
united
states
that's
recognized
in
many
of
our
states,
illinois,
ohio,
the
two
that
i
can
name.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well,
we
--
we
are
not
discussing
defenses.we
have
no
objection
to
their
coming
in
and
defending
the
suit.
as
i
--
and
as
i've
indicated,
they've
--
and
the
courts
below
have
reiterated,
there
was
prompt
and
punctilious
service
in
this
notification
in
this
so
that
counsel
could
come
in
and
challenge
jurisdiction.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
correct
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
he
could
--
could
very
well
of
them.
he
could
--
it
is
my
theory
judge.
i
--
i
have
not
raised
that
as
the
question
in
this
case.
i've
tried
to
limit
the
appeal
here
to
the
facts
before
the
court
but
of
course
this
court
can
go
even
broader
than
the
question
raised
by
the
petitioner
herein.
so
that
the
courts
of
new
york
under
which
were
--
the
parties
had
to
agree.
this
case
would
be
decided
as
authorizing
this
type
of
service
and
private
contracts,
privately
negotiated
are
not
bound
by
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendments
with
respect
to
due
process.
those
inhibitions
imposed
by
the
constitution.
the
court
below,
in
an
attempt
to
arrive
or
to
come
to
the
conclusion
which
it
did,
used
the
expression
that
it
was
construing
a
contract.
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
construction
can
in
nowise
change
the
terms
of
a
contract.
i
might
point
out
that
the
contract
was
first
signed
by
the
respondents
here.
they
made
no
challenge
to
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
contract.
they
signed
it
and
acknowledged
it,
returned
it
for
execution
by
the
petitioners.
it
was
only
after
they
were
in
the
(inaudible)
under
the
contract
where
--
and
incidentally
at
no
time
have
they
ever
returned
the
equipment
leased
and
are
still
in
possession
of
it,
seek
to
modify
or
excise
from
the
contract
that
portion
of
it
which
it
finds
distasteful.
now
i
--
i
would
suggest
that
these
respondents
should
be
stopped
from
challenging
this
provision
particularly
under
the
circumstances
where
they
still
retain
the
fruits
of
the
contract
but
don't
want
to
submit
to
that
portion
which
they
find
is
difficult.
now,
the
court
below,
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals,
made
a
passing
reference
to
contracts
of
adhesion
with
respect
to
this
and
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion
at
all.
as
i
understand
the
time
it
refers
to,
opprobrious
provisions
usually
imposed
by
those
having
greater
economic
power
over
those
who
having
lesser
economic
power
and
had
been
invoked,
as
i
understand
it,
primarily
in
insurance
cases.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
who
has
the
greater
economic
power,
the
petitioner
or
the
respondents.
and
the
reference
to
contracts
of
adhesion
must
only
go
to
the
fact
that
is
a
printed
contract
insofar
as
i'm
able
to
ascertain
and
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
beg
you
pardon
sir?
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
a
small
part.
that's
--
that's
what
were
said
although
that
both
courts
below
said
it
was
not
small.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
--
i
don't
have
a
copy
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
--
but
my
adversary
happens
to
have
it.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
think
it
is
a
photo
sir.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
so
that
no
objection
was
made
as
i
said
before
to
the
designation
of
the
person
named,
nor
was
any
attempt
made
to
substitute
someone
else.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes
it
does
sir,
based
upon
affidavit
duly
acknowledged.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no
--
no
sir,
that's
not
the
same.
new
york
does
not
recognize
a
confession
of
judgment
as
part
of
another.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes.
new
york
will
authorize
a
confession
of
judgment
separately
from
a
note
either
for
past
due
consideration
or
future
consideration.
so
that
a
prospective
debt
for
example,
if
i
would
loan
--
a
would
loan
b
some
money,
a
could
take
back
a
confession
of
judgment
from
b
and
enter
it,
and
we
are
providing
the
affidavit
set
forth,
what
the
consideration
was.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
yes.
in
other
words,
true
or
not
--
and
not
done
to
practice
a
fraud
on
other
creditors.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
don't
believe
it's
permitted
as
part
of
the
note
itself.
i
might
also
indicate
another
example
instead
of
a
cognovit
note,
and
as
to
agreement,
a
third
party
has
no
obligations
to
anybody.
and
they
made
a
fact
that
the
--
the
--
or
--
or
you
might
--
the
escrow
might
be
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties,
that's
frequently
done
in
new
york.
that
doesn't
make
the
escrow
agreement
invalid
and
none
--
none
are
unenforceable
by
--
by
that
reason.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
is
a
--
a
question
of
whether
private
persons
entering
into
arm's
length
contracts
can
have
portions
of
them
set
aside.
and
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
cases
in
this
court
and
circuit
courts
of
appeal
in
the
highest
states
of
new
york,
the
effect
of
it
--
a
contract
is
the
highest
form
or
evidence
of
the
terms
of
an
agreement
between
parties.
and
where
one
party
relies
on
the
terms
of
that
contract,
the
other
party
should
not
be
permitted
to
weasel
out
from
under
it
or
that
portion
of
it
which
he
finds
opprobrious,
simply
because
(a)
he
hasn't
read
it
or
(b)
he
didn't
understand
it
or
(c)
any
another
reason.
his
--
his
opportunity
to
challenge
the
terms
of
the
contract
comes
prior
to
execution
not
subsequent
thereto
and
particularly
not
after
he
has
breached
it.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well
that
--
that's
something
else
again
judge.
one
--
that
the
--
the
cases
are
uniformed
that
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
then
jurisdiction
over
the
person
maybe
consented
too.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
obviously
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
would
say
to
your
honor
that
no
contract
in
--
that
can
grant
jurisdiction
to
that
court
which
that
court
doesn't
have
to
start
with.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
think
it
is.
if
it's
between
two
individuals
and
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
indicated
that
that
is
permitted
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
i
--
my
research
indicates
that
it
is
permitted
in
the
state
of
illinois
subject
to
be
opened
if
there
was
no
contract.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
except
--
except
if
it
offends
the
public
policy.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
what
your
honor
has
just
stated
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
unless
it's
a
violation
of
the
public
policy
of
the
area
in
which
this
contract
is
negotiated
or
consummated.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i'm
on
(inaudible)
of
any
decision
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
but
i
do
know
that
my
research
did
disclose
that
in
ohio
and
in
illinois
that
that
was
authorized.
i
hope
to
put
--
i
understood
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
say
that
he
understood
it
that
way
in
illinois
too.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
so
there
is
one
last
thing
i
wanted
to
bring
out.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
have
cited
no
such
cases
in
my
brief
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well,
i
--
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
black
that
unless
the
public
policy
is
offended
thereby,
what
your
honor
has
stated
i
think
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law
and
that
is
the
basis
i
think
of
our
government,
the
free
people
may
freely
bargain
and
contract.
and
those
who
do
contract
have
the
power.
they
have
the
freedom
to
do
so
and
to
waive
whatever
rights,
privileges
they
may
have.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well,
i
--
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
comes
within
the
area
where
the
public
policy
was
offended
and
that
was
the
exception
to
which
i
advert
it.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well
i
say,
the
constitution
protects
all
citizens
and
i'm
saying
simply
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
i
--
and
i
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
would
say,
i
would
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
valid
contract
because
there's
no
one
forcing
the
other
contracting
party
to
execute
that
contract.
there's
a
--
there's
no
compulsion
upon
any
individual
to
sign
a
contract.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that
--
that
would
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no.
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
i
said,
then,
that
would
be
a
true
contract
of
adhesion.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
of
adhesion.
that
was
the
expression
used
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
so
it's
a
contract
of
adhesion.
but
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
establish
that
either
of
these
parties
had
a
greater
power
over
the
other,
nothing
at
all,
for
all
we
know,
for
all
i
know,
for
all
any
members
of
this
court
knows.
the
greater
bargaining
power
might
have
been
with
the
respondents.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
they
were
--
they
were
leasing
some
of
equipment,
i
don't
even
know
the
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
it
was
a
farm
equipment
mr.
--
i
--
i
--
i
honestly
couldn't
say
what
the
nature
of
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
think
that
even
if
(inaudible).
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
i
--
i
do
know
that
i
read
the
newspapers
that
many
farmers'
economic
powers
take
this
as
a
result
of
a
--
of
required
storing
of
grain
and
things
of
that
kind
have
accumulated
far
greater
wealth
than
other
individuals.
so
that
the
--
the
mere
--
the
fact
that
there
was
a
farmer
using
or
a
renting
farm
equipment
or
--
and
had
this
tax
or
anything
else
would
indicate
who
had
a
--
a
greater
bargaining
power.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
depending
upon
which
farm,
what
farmer
it
is.
i
wouldn't
say
that
each
farmer
have
the
same
bargaining
powers
than
other
farmers.each
must
stand
on
his
own.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
--
i
think
your
honor
expressed
that
very
well.
i
come
to
the
last
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
and
that
is
the
argument
raised
that
the
agency
so-called
was
not
an
agent
and
i
refer
my
brief
to
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency
and
a
fact
that
--
designation
of
agent
as
i
said
before
as
a
semantic
rather
than
a
true
turn
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
supreme
court,
that's
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i'm
not
certain
whether
the
gilbert-burnstine
case
which
is
a
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
highest
court
of
new
york
has
any
--
had
any
such
provision
in
it,
i'm
not
aware.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
--
i'm
fairly
familiar
with
the
opinion
in
the
gilbert
case
and
this
--
with
due
respect,
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
in
that
case
which
would
warrant
the
courts
coming
to
that
conclusion
except
that
in
that
case,
there
is
quoted
and
it's
quoted
in
my
brief
as
well
on
page
6
and
is
quoted
with
approval
--
a
quotation
from
scott
on
fundamentals
of
procedures.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
exactly
what
--
what
--
i
think
that
that
--
that's
the
reference
to
which
--
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
question
was
--
was
raised,
i
don't
think
it's
been
raised
in
a
--
in
an
appellate
court
prior
to
this.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
correct
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
ascertain.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
i'm
asking
you
to
reverse
them
not
only
on
new
york
law
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
one
of
the
terms,
yes.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well,
i
say
number
one,
they're
wrong
on
new
york
law.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no.
i
would
say
that
they
should
be
reversed
nevertheless.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
because
this
is
--
their
--
their
basis
was
not
based
upon
new
york
law.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
well,
if
it
solely
on
new
york
law,
then
they
have
to
be
right.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
right.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
that's
right.
i
see
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
wilbur
g.
silverman
no.
i
just
wanted
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
an
agency
set
up
for
the
purpose
solely
of
--
of
accepting
service.
service
was
affected,
notice
was
in
fact
given
and
the
whole
basis
upon
which
the
court
below,
both
courts
below
predicated
it
--
each
of
the
decisions
was
the
fact
that
inherently,
in
the
contract,
there
should've
been
a
provision
for
notice
and
i
say
that's
academic
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
there
because
ample
and
punctilious
notice
was
given.
nowhere
does
--
do
the
respondents
themselves
submit
anything
in
the
record
to
say
that
they
were
imposed
upon,
only
their
attorneys'
affidavit
that
this
was
a
fine
print
clause.
thank
you
very
much.
