mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
if
it
please
the
court.
first,
by
the
--
with
permission
of
the
court,
i
like
to
hand
up
the
particular
article
which
we
are
concerned
with
since
mr.
justice
black
mentioned
something
about
what
it
was
and
i
have
an
ad
here
which
gives
a
picture
of
it.
so
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
could
hand
it
up
so
it
can
be
looked
at.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
now
on
this
particular
case,
the
defendants,
of
father
and
son,
two
very
small
farmers
in
some
town
in
michigan
signed
this
lease
on
a
printed
form
which
i've
handed
up
to
the
court
and
something
has
been
said
about
the
economic
status
or
equality
of
the
of
contending
parties
and
the
--
the
law
as
it
had
been
said,
this
particular
petitioner
is
listed
on
the
american
stock
exchange,
does
business
all
over
the
country.
as
a
printed
form
of
contract,
evidently
does
a
tremendous
amount
of
business
and
to
compare
what
these
two
little
farmers
out
there
and
talk
about
economic
equality,
i
think
just
isn't
so.
now
the
type
of
product
here,
i
think
what
--
give
the
court
some
idea
to
what's
involved,
it
appears
that
these
farmers
were
sold
something
on
the
idea
where
if
they
purchased
this
article,
it
will
produce
grass,
some
kind
of
grass,
i'm
not
a
farmer,
which
will
contain
the
nutrients
that
would
be
similar
in
quality
so
the
nutrients
that
would
be
produced
in
the
summer
time
and
thereby
enable
their
cows
to
give
the
same,
if
not
greater
quantity
and
quality
of
milk
in
the
winter
times
with
the
summer
time
and
thereby
by
purchasing
this
expensive
equipment,
why
they
would
make
money
of
it.
well,
and
that
was
term
and
not
to
be
the
fact,
payment
was
just
not
made.
and
we
find
now
that
in
order
to
defend
this
lawsuit,
they
would
have
to
travel
a
distance
of
about
2000
miles
in
a
strange
part
of
the
country,
to
them
strange,
whereas
the
plaintiff
who
sought
them
out
and
sought
that
--
sent
this
representative
there
to
do
business
could
very
easily
come
out
there.
they
don't
have
to
produce
any
witnesses.
they've
got
their
contract
and
institute
an
action
there.
i
--
i'm
sort
of
coming
into
this
backwards
because
this
is
what
had
end
to
--
the
argument
ended
on
and
i
maintain
that
this
is
strictly
a
contract
of
inherence
and
not
a
freely
entered
into
contract
at
arm's
length.
the
defendant,
rather
the
petitioner
have
prepared
this
contract
over
god
knows
how
many
weeks
and
months
checking,
god
knows
what
law
and
with
how
many
attorneys
and
finally
handed
to
these
people
without
any
attorney
and
they
just
signed
it.
and
then
they
come
here
and
they
start
to
sue.
and
therefore,
when
i
first
saw
this,
it
was
the
inequity
that
struck
me.
and
i
made
this
motion
towards
the
service
and
i
find
that
there
is
a
rule.
i
like
to
speak
about
the
rule
because
i
do
not
know
what
may
influence
the
court.
and
as
long
as
it
has
mentioned,
i
will
speak
about
it.
i
say
that
this
rule
--
what
it
refers
to
an
agent
means
just
that,
an
agent.
i
maintained
that
this
reported
agent
is
not
an
agent
that
had
misstated
that
she's
the
wife
--
pardon
me,
the
sister
of
the
vice
president,
was
my
recollection
at
the
time
of
the
argument
for
this
motion
in
the
lower
court
that
it
was
stated,
she
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
officers.
and
i
so
set
forth
and
my
affidavit
had
never
been
challenged
until
now.
so
the
farmer
never
in
that
regard
was
not
willful,
but
still
the
relationship
was
close
enough
and
i
maintain
that
the
type
of
an
agent
referred
to
is
an
agent
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word.
an
individual
appoints
an
agent
and
i
think
we
all
know
what
that
means
without
my
going
into
great
detail,
someone
had
somebody
give
that
kind
of
control
or
at
least
acts
on
his
behalf.
there's
been
another
brief
submitted
here
why,
i
understand
the
representatives
of
the
american
bankers
association.
i
understand
they
will
not
argue
here
this
morning.
what
the
--
they
might
mention
of
a
--
cite
references
to
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency.
and
they
just
plot
words
and
then
they
applied
the
general
statements
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
the
illustrations
refer
to
in
the
restatement
of
their
agency
are
read,
it
becomes
very
obvious
that
the
reference
made
to
those
sections
as
quoted
by
the
petitioners
are
not
so.
the
illustrations
refer
to
something
entirely
different
and
if
i
may
just
quote
one.
for
example,
they
point
to
section
15
(b)
of
the
restatement
of
agency
and
if
this
setting
forth
while
it
states,
at
least
they
will
--
we
comply
with
it
in
our
case.
but
when
one
reads
the
illustration
is
brought
to,
one
finds
the
following,
(1)
p
writes
a,
whose
business
is
purchasing
for
others
telling
him
to
select
described
goods
and
ship
them
at
once
to
p.
before
answering
p's
letter,
a
does
as
directed
charging
goods
to
p.
a
is
authorized
to
do
this.
in
all
of
these
illustrations
it
becomes
very
obvious
that
the
type
of
an
agent
that's
referred
to
is
the
type
of
agent
we
all
have
in
mind
in
everyday
life.
now,
to
get
to
this
contract,
i
had
quoted
the
case
of
wuchter
against
pizzutti,
276
united
states
13
in
which
this
court
held
statute
of
new
jersey
unconstitutional
because
the
statute
did
not
direct
that
notice
be
sent
to
the
non-resident.
and
it
has
now
stated
that
that
rule
of
law
would
not
apply
for
this
case
because
that's
the
state
and
we're
individuals.
well
on
the
contrary,
i
think
if
it
applies
to
a
situation
of
that
type,
all
the
more
reason
why
it
should
apply
to
a
situation
of
our
type
because
the
secretary
of
a
state
to
serve
a
process,
it's
more
reasonable
to
assume
that
such
an
official
with
(inaudible)
process
to
the
defendant.
and
where
an
individual
is
involved,
especially
in
a
situation
of
this
type
whereas
the
person
relationship
--
all
the
more
reason
why
the
court
should
hold
that
such
a
--
in
such
a
contract
that
it
should
be
a
specific
provision
requiring
that
process
be
forwarded
to
the
defendant
because
such
an
individual
is
less
likely
and
is
less
responsible
than
an
individual
who
hold
an
official
office.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
so
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
i
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
i
would
like
to
use
the
same
argument
that's
been
used
by
a
supreme
court
in
that
case.
on
page
24,
what
it
has
said
"that
the
defendant
here
had
actual
notice
by
service
out
of
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania."
it's
on
my
brief
page
4,
i'm
sorry
i
was
quoting
from
page
24
of
the
--
of
the
decision,
on
page
4
on
my
brief.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
what
it
has
said
about
the
defendant
here
had
actual
notice
by
service
out
of
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania.
he
did
not
however
appear
in
the
courts
and
such
notice
was
not
required
by
the
statute.
not
having
been
directed
by
the
statute,
it
cannot
therefore
supply
constitutional
validity
to
the
statute
or
to
service
under
it
deciding
various
cases.
i
therefore
maintain
that
to
leave
it
up
to
an
individual
who
was
not
our
agent
has
no
connection
with
us
and
whose
interest
is
diametrically
opposed
to
ours
would
make
that
law.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
the
lease
of
course
speaks
for
itself.
counsel
has
admitted
that
she's
the
assistant
of
the
vice
president
of
the
petitioner.
we
don't
know
her.
we
never
heard
of
her,
never
had
any
correspondence,
no
obligation
on
her
part
to
act
for
us.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
when
i
--
i
would
but
not
under
that
point.
i'd
make
it
out
of
another
point.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
right.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
pardon
me.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
no.
i
think
on
several
grounds
and
i
make
it
on
several
grounds.
on
page
25,
before
the
first
paragraph
to
a
lot
--
the
sentence
before
the
first
paragraph
the
court
stated,
"we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
no
valid
agency
of
weinberg
for
defendants
was
created
by
the
instrument
in
the
suit
and
affirmed
the
order.
it
is
my
contention
that
the
mere
fact
that
she
would
be
required
to
serve
or
other
that
there
was
that
provision
that
she
would
be
required
to
serve
running
would
still
not
make
her
an
agent
and
the
court
so
held
there."
that
court
further
stated
in
the
first
paragraph,
"the
lease
constructed
here
was
in
a
printed
from
provided
by
plaintiff."
and
although
the
next
sentence
does
not
apply,
we
skip
down
to
"lack
of
such
a
provision
on
a
contract
of
adhesion
here
involved
may
however
be
considered
in
determining
the
meaning
and
effect
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract."
there
is
no
provision
on
the
lease
for
any
undertaking
by
the
purported
agent
to
act
for
or
give
notice
to
help
purport
a
principle.
so
that
if
we
want
to
assume
that
there
was
a
provision
that
she
was
to
--
for
this
process,
we
will
still
be
faced
with
the
question,
she
impose,
suppose
she
didn't,
what
remedy
--
what
the
defendants
have?
what
protection
would
they
have?
she
maybe
some
kind
of
non-entity
and
we
would
still
be
faced
with
a
greater
problem
which
is
a
question
of
due
process
under
the
constitution.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
i
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
that's
if
--
and
i
--
and
i
--
and
i
agree
with
you
and
i
would've
normally
stopped
there.
but
the
reason
i
don't
is
because
there
are
nine
judges
seating
and
i
don't
know
whether
--
that
is
your
concept
and
whether
all
nine
judges
would
agree,
so
therefore
i
have
to
go
further.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
i'll
--
i
first
attacked
it
on
the
question
that
this
rule
was
not
followed
because
she
is
no
agent.
i
--
i
think
i
argued
that
she
was
no
agent.
thought
her
interest
were
opposed
to
ours
and
she's
not
considered
an
agent
under
that
section.
and
the
--
that
supreme
court
decision
of
wuchter
applies
on
the
question
of
due
process.
and
then
i
carry
to
step
further
or
i
come
now
with
this
question
of
the
adhesion
contract
and
i
maintain
that
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion.
i
maintain
that
to
require
these
farmers
to
travel
2000
miles
to
defend
this
lawsuit.
is
it
not
inequitable
and
unjust
and
deprives
them
of
the
right
to
a
trial
in
any
court
because
by
placing
an
undue
burden
upon
them
and
compel
them
to
travel
such
a
great
distance
under
the
circumstances
is
an
effect
depriving
him
to
a
right
to
a
court
hearing,
and
thus
it
deprives
him
of
due
process
under
the
law.
some
questions
were
passed
about
cognovit
judgments
and
although
i
didn't
make
note
of
the
cases
that
hold
them
invalid,
i
remember
in
this
article
which
i'd
not
quote,
it's
not
in
the
brief
and
i
--
i
didn't
mention
it
because
i
started
clearly
--
clearly
for
the
question
at
hand.
and
this
is
an
article
by
hobson
entitled
"cognovit
judgments"
and
ignored
problem
of
due
process
and
full
faith
in
credit,
29
university
of
chicago
law
review
111,
1961.
and
in
that
article,
he
conducted
a
survey
amongst
many
of
the
lending
companies
throughout
the
country
asking
them
this
question
as
to
whether
to
use
to
it,
how
far
they
use
it
and
what
effect
is.
and
there
are
many
states
that
declared
it
was
invalid
and
i
think
only
three
or
four
states
hold
it
valid
of
which
illinois
was
one.
and
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
frankly,
i
didn't
check
into
the
law
of
new
york
on
the
cases
except
that
as
counsel
stated,
in
order
to
enter
judgment
by
confession,
one
would
set
forth
the
facts
upon
which
that
judgment
is
based.
and
if
one
attempts
to
enter
a
judgment
just
by
means
of
an
agreement
or
a
note,
that
is
invalid,
one
cannot
do
that.
therefore
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
do
you
mean
this
question
here?
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
no,
i
don't
think
it
depends
exactly
on
state
law.
i
think
the
broader
question
is
the
federal
law
and
then
the
smaller
question
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
federal
standards
and
then
--
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
applies
in
this
case.
what
i
--
what
i
--
what
i
say
is
that
if
he
attempted
to
commit
under
4
(b)
1
or
whatever
the
rule
might
be,
i
don't
know.
there's
nothing
set
forth
specifically
one
way
or
the
other.
but
if
he
came
under
that
section
and
if
that's
--
for
determining
issue,
i
say
it
doesn't
apply
in
this
particular
case.
i
--
i
say
the
new
york
law
as
cognavit
judgments
--
frankly,
i
don't
see
how
it
applies
here
because
i'm
not
asking
for
a
judgment
here.
although
indirectly,
it
may
have
that
effect
because
of
the
fact
that
we
would
not
be
in
the
position
to
defend
and
therefore
it
couldn't
affect
and
take
a
judgment
against
us.
but
the
specific
fact,
the
specific
issue
on
that
question
to
my
mind
is
not
before
us
because
it's
--
they're
not
seeking
to
enter
a
judgment
based
on
our
confession.
it
is
for
that
reason
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
new
york
law.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
well,
i
think
that's
governed
by
federal
law
because
they're
in
the
federal
court,
they
say
that
--
that
the
process
as
they
claimed
pursuant
to
a
federal
section
and
they
mailed
it
out
to
michigan,
if
anything
it
may
be
a
question
whether
michigan
law
applies,
where
the
service
is
affected.
mr.
harry
r.
schwartz
well,
the
action
is
here
but
where
--
if
it's
a
question
of
service
as
such,
where
did
the
service
take
place?
well,
of
course
they
contend
--
they
serve
the
so-called
agent
here.
it
is
their
contention
then
and
of
course
that
it
probably
took
place
here
but
it's
a
--
a
federal
service
question
as
i
see
it,
not
a
new
york
service
question.
that
is
just
on
the
question
of
service.
now,
a
lot
was
said
about
the
question
of
--
or
freedom
of
contract
but
if
we
were
to
take
this
question
of
freedom
of
contract
just
by
itself,
yes.
a
--
a
person
should
have
a
right
to
make
a
contract
but
i
maintain
there's
a
limit.
there's
a
difference
between
a
freedom
to
contract
and
so-called
freedom
to
adhere.
if
a
person
adheres
to
a
contract
that's
already
sent
before
them
in
fine
print
with
no
discussion
of
any
terms,
then
that's
not
a
freedom
of
contract,
there's
been
no
discussion
of
anything.
these
are
just
something
that's
been
handed
to
them
to
take
it
or
leave
it.
and
so,
it's
not
a
question
of
a
freedom
of
contract
but
all
involved
in
this
case.
if
the
terms
were
discussed
and
arrived
at
--
at
arm's
length,
that's
one
question.
or
where
something
is
submitted
to
someone
in
a
fine
printed
form
on
the
circumstance
of
this
case
then
i
say
this
is
not
a
question
of
freedom
of
contract
at
all.
in
fact,
it's
an
abuse
of
the
freedom
of
contract
because
if
we
continue
this
concept,
what
effect
we
will
have
will
eventually
be
legislation
by
contract,
if
we
don't
have
it
already
in
many
cases
by
the
so-called
large
companies.
so
if
we
want
to
keep
freedom
of
contract,
we
should
really
keep
it
in
its
broad
sense
where
two
people
sit
down
and
eye
now
a
contract
and
agree
upon
the
terms
and
the
terms
are
discussed,
not
on
the
so-called
form
of
a
contract
by
adhesion.
thank
you.
