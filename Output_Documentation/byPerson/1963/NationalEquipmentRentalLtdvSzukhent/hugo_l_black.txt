justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
agreed
a
court
to
have
jurisdiction
that
couldn't
possibly
have
jurisdiction
in
the
subject
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
uniformed
to
the
effect
if
that
can
be
done
by
an
original
contract
before
any
lawsuit
arrives?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
was
talking
about
the
merits.
i
have
in
mind
this
situation,
i
happen
to
know
it
but
formally
the
practice
somewhere
to
your
--
he
will
lend
money,
take
notes,
they
promise
to
pay
within
a
certain
length
of
time.
they
agreed
that
if
they
do
not
pay
at
that
length
of
time,
a
suit
can
be
filed.
that
the
money
lender
can
accept
service
for
the
lender
that
he
can
go
into
court
and
confess
judgment
not
merely
for
the
amount
of
the
judgment
but
for
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
would
your
argument
say
that
that's
valid
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
goes
on
the
theory
as
i
understand
your
philosophy
of
debate.
the
basic
philosophy
on
which
you
rest,
that
is
within
this
country,
people
who
deal
at
arm's
length
have
their
contracts
made
as
it
please,
nobody
can
--
they
can
never,
as
you
say
we've
allowed
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
any
states
held
that
that
is
not
adequate
notice
simply
to
give
it
to
the
money
lender
who
has
bought
or
owned
the
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
any
cases
cited
where
it
has
been
challenged
and
the
supreme
courts
have
sustained
it
where
the
situation
is
such
as
i've
stated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
someone
said
a
long
time
ago
that
equality
of
bargaining,
how
it
sometimes
ends.
and
you
are
saying
that
whether
the
deal
at
arm's
length
with
the
equality
of
bargaining
power
which
would
be
allowed
to
make
any
economy
contract
they
were
achieving
if
they
would
consent
that
they'll
never
be
notified
of
a
lawsuit
and
they
would
have
a
chance
to
defend
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than
some
cases,
i
think
it
has
drawn
distinctions
in
waiving
their
rights
to
go
to
court.
i
think
this
court's
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
the
right
to
come
in
the
federal
court
is
a
right
which
is
pretty
a
sacred
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hear
you
are
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
offend
both
public
policy,
any
code
of
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
they
cannot
be
elevated
to
a
constitutional
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
when
any
purchase
was
made,
in
one
part
of
the
country,
a
mail
order
(inaudible)
or
anybody
else.
that
--
that
they
make
the
contract,
one
of
these
contracts,
it
says
that
we
have
--
i
waive
jurisdiction
and
agreed
for
this
to
be
tried
3000
miles
away
for
the
--
person
from
whom
--
with
whom
he
made
a
contract
to
accept
service
on
our
behalf
and
pay
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
and
let
that
be
fixed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
--
that
would
be
a
valid
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
considerable
compulsion
in
many
instances
where
the
--
the
bargaining
power
is
wholly
unequal.
one
person
is
compelled
by
the
force
of
circumstances
and
they
feel
generally
to
buy
here
or
borrow
here
or
need
not
buy
or
borrow
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
makes
no
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
buying
farm
equipments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
equipment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
i
could
farm
or
buy
(inaudible)
flowers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
a
sewing
machines
from
singer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
indicate
that
an
individual
farmer
at
nebraska,
alabama,
mississippi
had
an
equal
bargaining
power
with
companies
that
manufacturers
(inaudible)
themselves?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
omnipotence
of
contracts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
asking
us
to
reverse
them
on
new
york
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
that
one
of
the
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
are
right
on
new
york
law
then
they
should
not
be
reversed,
could
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
suppose
they
are
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
should
accept
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we've
got
to
say
they
were
not
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whose
agent
she
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
seeking
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
service
of
process,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
say
that's
not
governed
by
new
york
law?
or
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
service
wasn't
in
michigan,
was
it?
