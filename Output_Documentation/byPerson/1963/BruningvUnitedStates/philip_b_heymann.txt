mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
bankruptcy
case
is
unfortunately
almost
invariably
somewhat
complicated,
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
two
things.
one,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
suggest,
the
government
is
not
claiming
anything
here
for
taxes
that
we
don't
believe
is
true
of
ethics
categories
of
debts
that
congress
felt
were
particularly
important
and
therefore,
should
not
be
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
now,
in
other
words,
this
case
has
no
special
aspect
for
taxes.
we
treat
it
as
a
bankruptcy
case
primarily.
i
may
now
and
then
go
out
from
this,
into
saying
that
there's
special
reasons
in
the
internal
revenue
code
why
the
government
should
win
this
case
but
almost
entirely,
i'll
treat
it
as
a
bankruptcy
case.
the
second
thing
i'd
like
to
say
by
way
of
preliminary
is
i'd
like
to
emphasize
a
distinction
that
mr.
mortenson
made
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
there
are
two
sorts
of
claims
which
can
be
relevant
which
a
creditor
may
have
in
bankruptcy.
he
may
have
a
claim
against
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt
which
have
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
now,
sometimes
called
as
the
"bankruptcy
estate",
and
he
may
have
a
claim
against
the
debtor.
he
started
with
a
claim
against
the
debtor
and
the
heart
of
our
position
is
he
continues
to
have
a
claim
against
the
debtor
unless
the
bankruptcy
act
discharges
it.
but
the
distinction
between
these
two
types
of
claim,
a
claim
against
the
party
which
is
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee
and
a
claim
against
the
debtor
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
act,
of
course,
has
two
primary
functions.
one,
to
muster
the
assets
of
the
bankrupt,
most
of
the
assets,
the
nonexempt
ones,
into
a
pot
or
fund
which
should
be
equitably
distributed
among
the
creditors,
and
two,
to
discharge
the
bankrupt
from
most
of
his
debts.
the
effect
of
these
two
purposes
on
creditors
is
carried
out
largely
by
section
63
and
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
creditors
who
are
--
who
have
claims
against
the
party,
which
are
almost
all
creditors
under
section
63,
generally
can
recover
only
against
the
pot.
section
17
says
that
the
liability
of
the
bankrupt
for
provable
claims,
that
means
the
claim
that
can
be
realized
out
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
shall
be
discharged
with
certain
exceptions,
limited
exceptions.
a
handful
of
creditors
received
no
claim
against
the
bankruptcy
estate
against
the
party.
certain
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh,
there
--
there
maybe
many
reasons
why
debt
maybe
provable
but
not
allowable.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
interest,
i
would
say,
would
be
one
that
--
that
i
--
i
--
my
contention
on
one
part
of
this
case
is
that
interest
during
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
is
not
provable
at
all.
but
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
acknowledge,
mr.
justice
white,
that
one
possibility,
that
--
that
what
interest
is
in
bankruptcy
is
a
much
mooted,
discussed
question.
it's
very
possible
to
say
that
interest
is
provable,
certain
interest
is
provable
but
not
allowable.
certain
interest
is
certainly
not
provable.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
--
if
i
may
borrow
from
my
boss,
mr.
justice
white,
i'd
like
to
ask
your
indulgence
to
let
me
go
on
to
--
the
--
oh,
i
say
--
i
was
saying
that
tort
creditors
are
creditors
who
don't
have
any
claim
against
the
estate.
they
don't
have
provable
claims
and
so
these
are
generally
not
discharged.
i
assume
--
no,
i
didn't
find
any
cases
on
it
that
it's
taken
for
granted
that
all
of
their
claim
remains
that
they
can
collect
interest
as
well
as
principle.
but
again,
i
didn't
find
any
cases
on
that.
there's
a
third
category
of
creditors
who
get
claims
both
against
--
who
--
who
may
have
claims
against
the
estate
but
whose
claims
are
not
discharged
by
section
17.
technically,
they're
provable
under
section
63
but
not
discharged
under
section
17.
congress
has
made
a
policy
judgment
that
these
claims
are
too
important
to
be
discharged
for
one
reason
or
the
--
for
another.
their
--
this
--
the
six
classes
of
claims
are
set
out
at
page
14
of
our
brief
in
summary
and
again
at
page
26.
examples,
there
seem
to
be
two
reasons
that
--
for
them.
one
is,
in
some
cases,
congress
has
judged
that
--
i
believe
that
the
creditor
needs
the
money
more
than
the
bankrupt.
a
support
allowance
is
not
discharged.
a
wage
earner's
claim
for
recent
wages
is
not
discharged.
the
wage
earner's
deposit
or
an
employee's
deposit
to
assure
that
he'll
complete
the
job
isn't
discharged.
others
are
not
discharged
perhaps
because
of
the
conduct
of
the
debtor
that
lead
to
the
claim
will
fall
in
malicious
injury
to
another
embezzlement,
certain
types
of
fiduciary
frauds.
but
in
any
rate,
there
are
six
categories
of
claims
of
which
taxes
are
one
which
congress
has
said
shall
not
be
discharged,
although
the
claimant
may
have
a
claim
against
the
pot
too.
in
other
words,
as
to
these
six,
they
can
collect
from
the
debtor
personally
or
from
the
trustee
by
going
into
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
now,
that's
the
rather
technical
but
important
framework
of
the
case.
the
reason
it's
important
are
two.
one
is,
that
this
court
and
the
english
courts,
but
let
me
restrict
it
to
this
court,
have
always
exercised
a
rather
considerable
common
law
power
in
deciding
how
the
pie
or
how
the
pot,
which
is
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
should
be
divided.
this
is
a
matter
that
is
traditionally
been
handed
in
the
--
handled
in
the
common
law
way
in
bankruptcy.
there
--
there
are
very
few
provisions
dealing
with
it
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
on
the
other
hand,
discharging
a
debtor
from
his
liability
to
a
creditor
is
an
act
that
only
the
bankruptcy
statute
has
in
general
have
done.
this
is
the
first
importance.
the
second
importance
of
the
matter
is
that
as
a
common
law
rule,
this
court
has
held,
following
english
precedents
that
go
back
to
1740,
that
the
--
some
--
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
make
the
predicate
of
this
sentence
somewhat
different.
this
court
has
followed
english
precedents
going
back
to
1740
in
setting
up
a
rule
for
liquidating
and
distributing
the
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee.
this
rule
which
has
been
one
of
administrative
conveniences,
it's
been
repeatedly
described
as
that
by
this
court,
is
a
rule
that
says,
"in
valuing
the
claims
against
the
bankruptcy
estate,
the
claim
should
be
valued
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy",
that
is
with
interest
only
up
to
the
--
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
now,
it's
perhaps
worthwhile
pointing
out
the
administrative
inconvenience
that
would
result
if
anything
else
were
done.
the
referee
declares
periodic
dividends.
if
interests
were
to
be
valued,
if
interests
at
different
rates
were
to
be
computed
all
the
way
up
through
--
through
the
period
--
to
the
period
of
each
dividend,
different
creditors
would
get
different
shares
of
every
distribution.
it
would
be,
in
short,
a
complete
mess.
this,
plus
the
equitable
argument
that
creditor
should
not
benefit
or
be
harmed
because
of
their
rate
of
interest
during
the
period,
that
the
assets
are
in
the
hands
of
a
court
official,
has
caused
the
court
to
say
that
as
a
rule
of
liquidation
where
the
estate
is
insolvent,
no
interest
shall
be
--
interest
shall
only
be
computed
up
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
the
claim,
in
other
words,
should
be
valued
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
my
--
in
--
in
the
saper
case,
new
york
versus
saper,
this
court
held
for
the
first
time
that
this
rule
for
liquidation
of
the
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee
applied
to
the
united
states.
there
is
no
discussion
in
the
saper
case
of
anything
else
except
the
applicability
of
the
general
rule
that
goes
back
to
the
justice
holmes'
opinion
in
sexton
versus
dreyfus
and
far
beyond
that
which
says
that
in
--
that
this
is
a
rule
of
liquidation.
it
was
just
applied
to
the
united
states
in
saper
versus
new
york.
i
want
to
add
only
one
other
thing
about
to
get
rid
of
the
saper
case
and
get
rid
of
the
line
of
cases
that
deal
with
interest
against
the
bankruptcy
estate
and
that
is
that
an
--
an
important
exception,
which
is
as
old
as
the
rule,
proves
that
the
rule
denying
interest
after
bankruptcy
against
the
trustee
was
never
intended
to
protect
the
debtor.
from
the
beginning
of
the
rule
from
1740,
if
there
any
--
if
the
estate
turns
out
to
be
solvent,
the
creditors
will
enjoy
the
benefit
in
the
form
of
payment
of
interest.
the
debtor
will
not
get
it
back.
there
are
more
over
other
instances
where
interest
runs
after
bankruptcy.
in
fact,
there's
only
one
case
where
interest
doesn't
run
after
bankruptcy
and
that's
where
the
estate
is
insolvent.
these
reasons,
the
reasons
that
justify
the
saper
rule
and
the
prior
cases
obviously
have
little
or
no
application.
i
--
i
would
say
no
application
to
a
case
such
as
this
involving
a
claim
against
the
debtor
personally.
there's
no
administrative
inconvenience.
there
is
no
harm
to
other
creditors.
and
in
general,
the
--
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
saper
principle
applies.
this
leaves
the
case
in
the
posture
of
going
to
the
statute.
i
had
begun
by
saying
that
of
the
two
types
of
claims,
claims
against
the
estate
and
claims
against
the
debtor,
traditionally,
the
court
has
exercised
great
common
law
powers
in
claims
against
the
estate.
it
is
--
it
has
turned
to
the
statute
in
claims
against
the
debtor
in
determining
discharge.
and
since
the
--
it
was
just
another
--
the
saper
rule,
which
i've
just
discussed,
was
a
rule
that
applied
only
as
to
claims
against
the
trustee.
for
this
case,
which
involves
a
claim
against
the
debtor,
we
must
turn
to
section
17.
section
17
says
that
six
classes
of
debts
will
not
be
discharged.
the
primary
position
that
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
is
that
section
17
simply
cannot
operate
to
discharge
interest.
now,
this
is
a
fairly
mechanical,
technical
argument.
before
getting
to
that,
i'd
like
to
argue
that
every
reasonable
implication
when
congress
says
that
a
debt
shall
be
preserved
against
discharge
would
be
that
congress
meant
that
debts,
in
all
its
parts,
principle
and
interest,
would
continue.
we
cited
a
case
in
our
brief
where
the
debtor
was
denied
of
discharge.
the
bankrupt
was
denied
of
discharge.
the
bankruptcy
court
held
and
the
district
court
quickly
affirmed
that
all
creditors
could
receive
interest.
if
the
debt
is
not
discharged,
interest
presumably
is
not
discharged.
beyond
--
beyond
this
there
are,
in
fact,
positive
indications
that
congress
contemplated
interest
continuing
when
the
debt
was
not
discharged.
in
--
i've
printed
--
i'm
afraid
at
the
very
late
date,
a
--
a
supplemental
appendix
in
this
brief.
it
refers
to
a
very
particular
problem
that
congress
was
dealing
with.
it's
not
controlling
of
this
case.
it's
on
page
3
of
the
supplemental
appendix.
congress
provided
that
there
would
be
interest
on
any
amount
not
paid
in
bankruptcy
running
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
it's
on
page
3,
section
298
of
the
1939
code.
the
provision
disappeared
when
all
the
interest
provisions
of
1939
code,
of
which
there
were
many,
were
merged
into
the
single
interest
provision
which
you
see
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
1954
code.
it's
perhaps
for
these
reasons,
for
the
reasons
of
the
general
assumption
that
when
the
debt
continues,
interest
continues.
interest
after
all
being
--
almost
always
a
con
--
commitment
of
the
debt,
always
--
almost
always
going
along
with
the
debt,
that
the
courts,
and
we
have
set
forth
90
opinions,
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
have
almost
universally
allowed
interest.
mr.
mortenson
is
correct
in
saying,
without
much
discussion,
have
almost
universally
allowed
interest
on
an
undischarged
debt.
the
courts
have
said,
which
is
our
position
here,
that
if
the
statute
does
not
discharge
the
debt,
it
remains
unaffected
by
the
bankruptcy
act.
this
result
is
moreover
confirmed,
and
here
i'm
afraid
i
must
again
become
technical,
by
the
fact
that
section
17
will
not
operate
to
discharge
much
of
the
interest
in
this
case,
and
we
will
contend,
it
doesn't
operate
to
discharge
any
of
it.
mr.
justice
white
asked
about
the
--
whether
interest
might
not
be
provable
but
not
allowable.
it's
that
--
it's
the
distinction
between
provable
and
allowable
that
is
the
technical
argument
as
to
interest
in
this
case.
section
17
discharges
only
provable
debts.
if
interest
or
any
portion
of
interest
is
not
provable,
it's
not
discharged.
i'd
like
to
direct
the
attention
first
to
the
interest
that
arises
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
is
completed
and
all
the
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
trustees
have
been
paid
out
of
the
trustee.
it
appears
clear
that
this
interest
simply
cannot
be
provable.
it's
not
a
debt
that
exist
at
any
time
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
it's
not
--
it
can't
be
valued,
it
can't
be
estimated
in
any
way.
even
if
it
could
otherwise
be
proved,
there's
a
specific
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
says
that
it
shall
be
treated,
that
such
debts
which
can't
be
valued
during
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
should
be
treated
as
nonprovable
for
purpose
of
--
for
purposes
of
preserving
them
against
discharge.
now,
as
to
that
interest,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
within
traditional
categories
it's
not
provable.
a
harder
question
in
the
technical
--
in
the
technical
area
of
whether
it's
a
provable
debt
or
not
is
presented
by
the
interest
that
arises
during
the
proceeding.
now,
the
saper
case
carefully
says
throughout
that
interest
should
not
be
allowed
on
a
tax
claim
after
the
date
of
the
petition.
the
saper
case
never
says
specifically
it's
not
a
provable
claim.
now,
we
believe
that
the
--
the
reasons
saper
gave
established
that
it's
not
a
provable
claim.
saper
said
two
things.
one,
it
turned
back
to
the
historic
rule
which
says
that
provable
claims
must
be
determined
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
and
it
--
and
this
was
the
sexton
rule
and
it
turned
to
that.
its
--
second
of
all,
looked
at
the
statute
which
defines
provable
claims,
and
it
--
this
section
63,
there
are
six
or
eight
categories
of
provable
claims.
two
of
these
specifically
are
listed
as
not
including
interest.
saper
looked
to
that
and
said
therefore,
interest
should
not
be
careful,
regarding
the
word
"allowable"
on
a
tax
claim.
we
believe
that
meant
provable.
now,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
there's
no
question
as
to
whether
interest
arising
during
the
proceeding
could
be
considered
a
provable
claim.
i
suppose
there
--
i
suppose,
perhaps,
it
could
be
considered
a
provable
claim.
i
don't
believe
that
interest
arising
after
the
proceeding
could
be
considered
a
provable
claim.

b.
heymann
mr.
justice
white,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
there
is
proof
and
allowance
in
those
cases.
the
leading
case
which
says
that
interest
is
allowable
out
of
the
surplus
is
an
early
circuit
court
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
they
make
it
a
matter
of
general
equitable
law
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
justice
black
discussed
the
source
of
the
law
at
some
length
in
the
vanston
bondholders
case.
i
think
they
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
general
equities.
when
the
estate
is
solvent,
who
should
--
who
is
more
equitably
entitled
to
the
money,
the
debtor
or
the
creditor,
who
has
not
received
his
interest
and
the
answer
has
been
the
creditor
who
has
not
received
his
interest.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
believe
it
can,
justice
white.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
(inaudible)
--
there
are
--
there
are
two
--
there
are
two
courts.
the
second
circuit
and
ninth
circuit
have
ruled
squarely
on
it
and
have
held
squarely
in
our
favor.
we
believe
that
we
could
forget
about
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
that
all
of
the
assets
go
to
the
other
creditors,
move
against
the
debtor
and
collect
the
full
amount
of
our
debt
including
interest.
now,
the
--
this
isn't
essential
to
this
case
that
we
maintain
this
position
but
this
is
our
position.
i
--
there's
only
one
more
point
i
have
on
the
technical
argument
then
i'll
be
happy
to
leave
that.
mr.
mortenson
referred
to
what
he
called
an
inconsistency
in
our
brief.
we
do
argue
that
to
the
extent
that
taxes
--
to
the
extent
that
interest
is
provable,
it's
provable
as
a
part
of
the
claim
that
it's
not
discharged.
in
other
words,
if
we're
wrong
in
saying
that
saper
says
--
if
we're
wrong
in
our
construction
of
saper,
we
believe
that
saper
says
that
interest
is
not
provable
and
therefore
not
dischargeable.
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that,
and
some
interest
is
provable,
interest
arising
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding,
not
afterwards
but
during
the
pendency
of
it,
then
this
would
be
provable
as
part
of
the
claim.
the
--
i
was
going
to
say
the
leading
earlier
cases,
johnson
against
norris
which
says
just
this.
this
is
what
judge
frank
said
in
a
dissent
in
sword
line,
"no
separate
proof
would
be
required,
would
be
all
part
of
the
same
claim."
and
for
that
reason,
it
wouldn't
be
discharged.
this
would
be
true
of
all
six
categories.
it
would
be
particularly
true
of
tax
claims
where
the
internal
revenue
code
says
that
interest
is
always
part
of
the
tax.
that's
one
of
the
few
places
or
the
part
from
my
principle
of
discussing
on
the
bankruptcy
law.
i'd
like
to
move
on
from
--
what
i've
tried
to
say
so
far
is
that
the
saper
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
claims
against
debtors.
it
only
has
to
do
with
claims
against
the
estate,
it's
a
liquidation
rule.
as
collier
says
very
clearly
before
distributing
the
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
trustee,
i've
tried
to
say
it
on
its
face,
section
17
would
seem
to
leave
the
whole
debt
intact,
principal
as
well
as
interest
and
that
construed
technically
half
of
the
interest
to
the
most
important
part
of
the
interest.
the
interest
that
arises
after
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
can't
be
discharged
by
section
17
and
congress
recognizes
this
in
the
statute
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
i
think
in
fairness
and
perhaps
to
guard
myself,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
equities
of
the
situation.
on
the
surface,
it
appears
that
it's
highly
inequitable
to
allow
interest
to
be
collected
after
bankruptcy
against
the
debtor.
now,
to
that,
we
have
three
responses.
one
is,
the
government
is
one
of
six
classes
of
claimants
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
there's
anyway
that
the
government
can
be
separated
off
from
its
five
neighbors.
many
of
those
classes
or
several
of
those
classes
were
apparently
chosen
because
congress
believed
that
the
creditor
deserved
the
interest
more
than
the
bankrupt
debtor,
needed
the
interest
more.
a
leading
example
would
be
a
case
of
a
wife
with
a
child
who
is
owed
a
support
payment.
now,
the
--
her
husband
goes
through
bankruptcy.
congress
determined
that
she
needed
the
support
payment
more
than
the
bankrupt
needed
the
discharge.
if,
because,
she
didn't
have
the
support
payment,
she
had
to
borrow
money
and
pay
interest.
congress
would
also
want
the
husband
to
be
liable
for
interest
on
the
amount
on
the
--
on
the
length
of
time
he
didn't
pay
it
back.
this
shouldn't
be
her
cost.
it
should
be
the
husband's
cost.
when
congress
decided
that
she
needed
it
more,
congress
presumably
decided
that
she
needed
the
interest
more,
too.
she's
doing
without
money.
in
the
tax
area,
which
i
don't
think
can
be
separated
off,
even
there,
the
equities
are
not
100%
clear.
in
this
case,
mr.
bruning
collected
interest
from
us
for
the
very
period
that
he's
objecting
to
pay
an
interest.
now,
i
just
mean
to
give
this
as
an
example.
i
don't
think
this
is
controlling
in
this
case,
an
example
of
the
fact
that
the
equities
are
never
clear.
as
i
calculate
it,
this
is
--
the
interest
is
referred
to
in
the
record,
as
i
calculate
it,
the
interest
is
very
close
to
the
same
amount
going
both
ways.
now,
this
--
if
there's
any
equity
here,
it's
not,
in
this
particular
case
if
there's
any
equity,
it's
not
in
mr.
bruning's
favor.
finally
on
the
equities,
i
want
to
say
that
it's
very
questionable
policy
to
deny
a
creditor
the
price
he
gets
for
forbearance
in
collecting
his
debt.
now,
anyone
of
the
six
classes
of
creditors
in
this
case,
can
collect
against
the
exempt
assets
of
the
debtor
and
can
collect
against
anything
the
debtor
gets
immediately.
the
government,
in
particular,
has
very
broad
collection
powers.
i
think
the
government
has
heart
and
would
not
collect
against
the
home
or
any
other
exempt
assets
of
the
debtor.
but
the
government
could
and
forbears,
perhaps
in
part,
because
it
receives
interest
for
its
forbearance.
it's
paid
for
its
forbearance
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
interest
is.
it's
very
questionable
policy
to
force
creditors
to
collect
immediately
or
as
soon
as
possible
or
to
encourage
them
to
rather
than
to
forbear.
in
the
very
few
minutes
i
have
remaining,
i'd
like
only
to
say
--
perhaps
a
good
way
of
saying
it
is
explaining
--
is
to
explain
why
i
set
forth
the
first
part
of
the
supplemental
appendix.
mr.
mortenson
hasn't
referred
here
to
a
provision
of
the
1954
internal
revenue
code
which
says
that
the
united
states
can
collect
interest
on
any
--
on
a
portion
of
a
tax
which
is
allowed
but
not
paid
but
he
relied
on
it
in
his
brief.
i
set
forth
the
supplemental
appendix
because
it
--
this
act
came
in
in
1926.
the
function
of
the
act
was
to
permit
the
bankruptcy
court
to
serve
in
place
of
what
is
now
the
tax
court,
the
board
--
board
of
tax
appeals.
the
government
was
permitted,
instead
of
waiting
the
length
of
time
it
would
have
to
in
an
income
tax
case,
to
go
directly
--
assist
the
tax
directly
in
going
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
litigate
it.
the
bankruptcy
court
would
decide
whether
it
was
valid
or
invalid,
that
is
whether
it
was
allowed,
to
be
allowed
or
not
to
be
allowed.
the
government
was
given
in
exchange
by
provision
(b)
which
is
now
the
provision
that
mr.
mortenson
--
the
predecessor
of
provision
mr.
mortenson
relies
on,
the
statute
of
limitations
of
six
years
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
was
over,
after
it
was
determined
whether
the
government
was
entitled
to
its
tax.
the
government
was
also
given
an
interest
on
any
amount
that
was
then
determined
to
be
due
and
not
paid
at
that
time.
nothing
could
be
clearer
than
this
interest
provision
in
rebutting
any
contention
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
cut
off
interest.
finally,
in
the
committee
reports
on
that
very
tax
bill
on
which
it
came
in,
the
house
committee
made
entirely
clear
that
it
believed
interest
was
owing
not
only
for
the
period
after
the
end
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
but
also
for
the
pendency
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
i've
set
that
forth
in
the
little
appendix
2.
it
says
that
there
has
to
be
a
special
rate
of
6%
instead
of
12%
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding.
thank
you.
