mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
before
us
started
out
as
a
tax
case
and
then
got
involved
in
bankruptcy
but
it
ends
up
here
as
a
matter
involving
interest.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
government
on
a
tax
deficiency
can
collect
interest
after
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
is
filed
from
the
debtor's
assets.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
government
seeks
interest
on
a
tax
deficiency
from
the
bankruptcy
estate.
the
government
concedes
that
it
cannot
do
that
because
this
court,
in
city
of
new
york
versus
saper,
has
held
that
the
government
may
not
collect
interest
on
a
tax
deficiency
accruing
after
bankruptcy
out
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
the
case
arose
in
this
manner.
bruning,
the
petitioner,
was
doing
business
as
bruning
construction
company.
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
1951,
he
became
in
arrears
in
withholding
tax
and
social
security
tax
in
the
approximate
amount
of
$4000.
a
delinquent
tax
return
was
filed
and
the
government
assessed
the
tax
in
1952.
it
issued
a
notice
and
demand
in
a
formal
manner
in
1952.
in
june
of
1953,
bruning
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
bankruptcy.
three
years
later,
there
were
assets
in
the
amount
of
$700
applied
to
this
tax
deficiency.
there
was
no
interest
applied
because
the
saper
case,
decided
by
this
court,
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
since,
as
i
shall
explain
later,
taxes
have
a
priority,
the
$700
applied
to
the
tax
deficiency
reduced
that
deficiency
but
the
general
creditors
received
no
dividend.
bruning,
on
his
1953
and
1954
income
tax
returns
had
overpaid
his
tax.
he
had
overpaid
his
tax
on
both
returns.
and
he
was
entitled
to
a
refund
of
about
$3700.
he
filed
the
claim
and
the
claim
was
allowed.
the
government
then
applied
this
$3700
refund
against
the
withholding
taxes
and
social
security
taxes
that
were
owed
for
the
fourth
quarter
of
1951.
there
was
no
notice
and
demand
filed.
the
government
simply
applied
the
money.
when
the
government
did
that,
it
took
$795
and
applied
it
to
interest
on
the
$3700
deficiency
accruing
from
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
in
1953
until
the
payment
or
the
credit
in
1958.
we
do
not
have
in
question
today
interest
on
prebankruptcy
tax
deficiency.
both
the
taxpayer,
petitioner,
and
the
government
concede
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
interest
on
a
tax
deficiency
up
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
at
this
time
the
anomalous
situation
that
the
taxpayer
is
in.
suppose
the
tax
deficiency
is
a
$100,000
and
that
is
not
too
unusual
in
his
bankruptcy
cases.
in
the
mighell
case,
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
bruning
case
below,
the
tax
deficiency
was
$78,000.
but
if
the
tax
is
$100,000,
in
three
years
at
6%
interest,
the
interest
would
be
$18,000.
now,
the
government,
because
of
its
priority,
collects
the
$100,000
but
if
the
payment
--
and
there's
$18,000
available
for
payment,
it
cannot
be
used.
that
$18,000
is
available
to
general
creditors
but
the
government
can't
take
it
up
and
use
it
for
interest
because
this
court
decided
in
the
saper
case
that
it
could
not
be
done.
so
the
taxpayer
has
no
way
of
wiping
out
this
$18,000
in
interest
on
the
tax
deficiency
and
the
government
can
and
will
pursue
that
as
long
as
he
lives.
they
will
pursue
it
and
try
to
take
it
out
of
his
after
bankruptcy
acquired
assets.
now,
the
government
is
using
two
inconsistent
arguments
in
trying
to
get
at
these
after
acquired
assets
of
the
debtor.
section
17
of
the
bankruptcy
code
provides
that
taxes
are
not
discharge
--
that
taxes
are
not
dischargeable.
they
are
provable
debts
but
they
are
not
dischargeable
debts.
as
distinguished
from
a
general
creditor
who
has
a
provable
debt
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is
not
paid
out
of
--
out
of
the
assets
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
it
is
wiped
out.
the
rest
of
it
is
discharged.
not
so
with
taxes
because
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
as
i
said
before,
taxes
are
specifically
accepted
from
discharge.
now,
we
have
another
part
of
the
bankruptcy
code
which
comes
into
play,
as
i
stated
before,
the
government
took
$700
out
of
the
bankrupt's
assets
to
pay
the
deficiency.
that
was
because
the
government,
under
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
has
priority.
it
gets
paid
before
the
general
creditors
get
paid.
now,
that
brings
to
the
inconsistency
--
that
brings
us
to
the
inconsistency
i
mentioned
before.
the
government,
in
trying
to
save
its
interest,
argues
first
that
it's
not
approvable
debt
dischargeable
under
section
17
because
it
says,
the
interest
has
not
become
due
at
any
time
during
the
proceeding.
and
there's
no
way
of
estimating
whether
it
ever
will
be
owing
or
in
what
amounts.
but
then,
it
later
argues,
quoting
from
page
19
of
the
government
brief,
"to
the
extent
that
interest
is
provable
on
a
tax
liability,
it
is
provable
as
part
of
a
single
provable
debt
for
taxes".
but
provable
debts
for
taxes
are
specifically
accepted
from
discharge
by
section
17.
this
is
the
reason
prepetition
interest
is
concededly
not
discharged
in
the
present
case.
the
same
rationale
would
--
would
control
post-petition
interest
if
it
too
were
provable.
now,
why
does
the
government
argue
this?
first,
it
says
interest
is
not
taxes
and
then
it
says
interest
is
taxes.
why
does
it
say
interest
is
taxes?
because
if
it
is
taxes,
then
it
is
not
dischargeable,
and
there's
considerable
argument
here
to
the
effect
that
interest
is
collected
like
taxes,
it's
treated
like
taxes,
it's
assimilated
in
the
tax
but
the
fact
is
that
interest
is
not
tax,
it's
never
has
been
and
never
will
be.
and
as
far
as
being
determinable,
at
any
time,
you
just
take
your
6%
and
apply
it
to
the
principle
and
there
you
have
it.
but
the
--
the
principle
thing
here
is
that
under
the
decision
of
the
saper
case,
we
believe
that
this
issue
was
really
decided.
the
broad
language
of
the
case,
if
you'll
permit
me
to
read
it
because
i
believe
it's
important,
covers
this
case.
the
court
stated,
and
this,
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
the
opinion,
more
than
40
years
ago.
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
for
the
court
that
the
rules
stopping
interest
at
bankruptcy
had
been
--
been
followed
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half.
he
said
the
rule
was
not
a
matter
of
legislative
command
or
statutory
construction
but
rather
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
english
bankruptcy
system
that
we
copied,
citing
sexton
versus
dreyfus
which
was
--
which
was
--
the
opinion
of
which
was
written
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
now,
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
cutting
off
interest
as
far
as
the
bankruptcy
estate
is
concerned
and
then
taking
it
up
as
far
as
the
debtor's
assets
are
concerned.
the
government
already
has
two
advantages.
it
has
a
priority
and
it
has
approvable
debt
that
is
not
dischargeable.
now,
the
government
seeks
a
third
advantage.
it
wants
to
pursue
the
after
bankruptcy
acquired
assets
of
a
debtor
and
pick
up
the
interest
at
that
point
which,
if
it
should
have
been
paid
to
the
government,
ought
to
come
out
of
the
bankruptcy
assets.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
justice
goldberg,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
because,
i
might
have
forgotten.
the
--
the
government
made
quite
a
bit
of
that
by
--
by
adding
cases
--
by
listing
some
90
cases
in
the
appendix.
now,
that
matter,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
never
been
brought
to
this
court.
and
those
cases
--
and
the
government
very
clearly
says
that
interest
was
almost
never
discussed
in
those.
in
other
words,
those
cases
were
just
carried
through
with
the
--
with
the
interest
on
the
--
on
the
liability
carried
along.
and
there
hasn't
been
any
real
adjudication
of
that.
and
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
the
same
principle
should
apply.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
yes,
your
honor,
the
interest
should
stop
when
the
petition
is
filed.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
i
would
take
just
a
--
just
a
few
minute.
as
far
as
the
solvent
estate
is
concerned,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
how
it
handled
proves
anything
because
if
there's
enough
money
to
go
around,
the
whole
thing
is
treated
as
if
there
weren't
any
bankruptcy
in
the
first
place.
but
the
argument
about
different
rates
of
interest
and
inequity
among
creditors
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
application
at
all
to
a
government
claim
for
taxes
because
the
government
has
a
fourth
priority.
the
government
comes
in
before
any
general
creditor
does.
it
has
6%
interest.
if
it's
taken
out,
we
don't
have
any
interest
problem
as
far
as
the
general
creditors
are
concerned.
but
i
just
want
to
call
the
attention
to
one
more
thing.
the
sections
of
the
code,
set
out
in
the
appendix
by
the
government,
do
not
apply
because
they
deal
with
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
notice
and
demand.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
notice
and
demand,
and
that's
a
technical
term
and
it's
a
prerequisite
to
a
collection
of
taxes
except
where
you
get
a
credit.
we
--
in
this
case,
there
was
a
credit
from
1953
and
1954
taxes
on
a
1951
taxes
that
it
don't
apply.
but
here's
something
that
i
consider
very
important.
the
first
section
set
out
from
the
1926
code
is
section
282
(a)
and
calls
for
interest.
that
is
carried
over
into
the
next
section
given
in
the
government
appendix
to
section
298.
and
you
will
note,
it
calls
for
interest
at
the
rate
of
6%.
now,
between
1939
and
the
1954
code,
this
court
decided
saper.
and
after
saper
was
decided,
in
the
1954
code,
as
you
will
find
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
section
6
at
page
29,
petitioner's
brief,
section
6873,
unpaid
claims,
it
does
not
call
for
interest.
under
the
1939
code,
section
298,
if
you
read
it
you'll
see
it
calls
for
interest.
after
the
saper
case,
section
6873
(a)
does
not
call
for
interest.
the
inference
is
that
congress
codified
the
saper
case.
thank
you
very
much.
