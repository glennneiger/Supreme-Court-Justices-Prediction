in
the
previous
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
case
--
i
know
that's
finished
but
that
they
didn't
ask
the
storeowner
to
stop
buying
apples,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
realize
he
has
to
stop
but
they
had
to
stop
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
selling.
but
that
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
a
great
change
before
1959
it
had
to
be
a
concerted
activity
by
two
or
more
people?
justice
potter
stewart
concerted
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
change
isn't
relevant
here.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
substantial
change.
justice
potter
stewart
but
don't
you
--
isn't
it
certainly
clearly
arguable
just
talking
about
the
plain
meaning
of
language,
if
there
is
such
a
thing,
that
this
case
is
within
a
literal
language
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(i)?
wasn't
there
here
an
inducement
of
an
individual
before
and
by
a
person
engaged
in
commerce
to
refuse,
in
the
course
of
his
employment
as
the
manager
of
the
store
to
deal
in
or
handle
the
product
of
the
--
distributed
by
the
primary
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
given
that
that
kind
of
conduct
would
not
be
prohibited
was
that
the
--
in
that
kind
of
conduct
would
not
be
to
threaten,
coerce,
or
restraint,
isn't
that
right?
that
workers
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
merely
be
to
persuade
or
induce
or
encourage
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
difficulty
there
is
that
in
8
(b)
(4)
(i),
you
have
induced
or
encouraged,
you
have
different
language.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
argue
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
argument
in
this
case,
you
said,
produced
by
one
employer,
that
being
servette.
there's
a
big
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
this
does
cover
servette
since
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
servette
is
--
it
doesn't
actually
produce,
it
distributes.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
coming
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
the
--
or
am
i
mistaken,
didn't
the
war
labor
disputes
act
have
a
provision
incorporating,
by
reference,
the
definition
of
"produce"
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
argument
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
all
this
doesn't
bear
at
all
on
the
--
on
the
solicitor
general's
present
argument,
does
he
--
does
it?
and,
that
being
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
argument
being
that
this
section
is
addressed
to
employees
who
withhold
their
services
from
their
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
they
withhold
work
from
their
employer
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
one
in
that
area
or
another.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
four
elements,
at
least
four
elements,
here
and,
i
guess,
we're
referring
now
to
the
third
element.
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
assuming
--
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
what
kind
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
people
are.
justice
potter
stewart
his
argument
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
this
section
is
not
addressed
to
this
kind
of
conduct
but,
rather,
to
conduct
on
the
part
of
employees
which
is
tantamount
to
refusing
to
work
for
their
employer
in
one
area
or
another.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
you're
not
addressing
you
and
--
yourself
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
i
agree
with
you
that
the
--
that
--
as
he
did.
that,
literally,
read
this
could
cover
this
conduct
but
his
argument
was
that,
strictly
in
light
of
the
history
of
this
and
the
development
of
this
section,
that
it
wasn't
addressed
to
this
kind
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
