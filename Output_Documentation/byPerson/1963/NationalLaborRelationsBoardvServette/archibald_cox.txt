mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
another
secondary
boycott
case,
very
similar
to
the
case
just
argued.
here
the
primary
employer,
the
company
with
which
the
union
had
its
dispute.
with
servette,
a
wholesale,
packer,
distributor
of
candy,
holiday
supplies,
salad
oil,
and
similar
specialty
products
sold
in
grocery
stores.
the
secondary
employers
were
chains
of
retail
grocery
stores
that
bought
and
resold
servette
products.
the
union
here,
in
order
to
put
pressure
upon
servette,
the
wholesaler
and
primary
employer,
engaged
in
two
kinds
of
activities
with
respect
to
the
independent
chain
stores.
at
first
the
union
went
to
the
managers
of
the
individual
stores
but
because
these
were
chains,
so
the
manager
didn't
run
a
dog
store,
he
ran
a
store
for
company
like
safeway
or
the
amp
or
something
like
that
and
asked
the
manager
to
cooperate
with
the
union
by
stopping
and
selling
on
the
servette's
products.
it
was
very
like
the
last
case
wherein
they
asked
the
safeway
to
--
in
effect
the
safeway
to
stop
selling
tree
fruit
apples,
and
they
have
had
a
lot
of
salad
oil
on
their
hands
here,
if
they
didn't
have
it,
they'd
have
a
lot
of
rotten
apples
on
their
hands
in
that
case,
i
take
it
if
they
didn't
have
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they
never
said
“stop
buying”,
they
asked
him
to
stop
selling
them.
i
suppose
the
consequence
would
be
that
he
had
a
lot
of
apples
on
him
--
rotten
apples
on
his
hands
and
he
would
therefore,
i
think
he'd
stop
buying.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
in
so
many
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
i
was
trying
to
prepare
the
analogy,
i
will
stick
to
this
case
so
i
didn't
want
to
reargue.
here,
i
think
they
asked
him
to
stop
buying
from
the
servette.
in
any
event
they
certainly
in
effect
asked
them
to
stop
buying
because
they
said,
“don't
sell
servette
goods.”
and
the
consequence
would
be
that
you
inevitably
that
you
didn't
buy
servette
products
unless
you
wanted
to
fill
your
warehouse
with
it.
some
of
the
managers
exceeded
to
the
union's
request,
others
refused.
there
was
no
threat,
coercion
or
restraint
except
by
the
handbill
that
i
will
describe
in
a
moment.
and
the
first
question
presented
here
is
whether
this
request
to
the
managers
not
to
continue
to
deal
in
servette
products
where
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(i),
that's
not
the
one
we've
been
discussing
in
this
case,
but
the
one
i
had
discussed
in
laying
the
background
as
to
the
old
taft-hartley
act.
where
the
manager
didn't
cooperate,
where
he
continued
to
sell
servette
products,
then
the
union
threatened
to
and
then
didn't
did
pass
out
handbills
asking
the
public
not
to
buy
various
servette
products.
some
of
them
listed
the
products
by
trade
name
and
others
spoke
of
servette
as
i
remember
it
specifically.
there
was
no
picketing
of
any
kind.
there
was
no
strike,
no
stoppage
of
deliveries.
and
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
threats
to
handbill
and
the
handbilling
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
(ii),
the
section
we
were
talking
about
in
the
last
case.
i'll
discuss
the
two
questions
in
the
order
that
i
stated
them.
the
board's
order
can
--
finding
that
there
were
no
unfair
labor
practices,
can
stand
only
if
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
under
either
section,
so
we
have
to
make
out
two
points
to
succeed
here.
once
again
coming
to
the
first
of
those
questions
that
the
request
to
the
store
manager,
i
think
it's
most
helpful
to
go
back
and
note
the
evolution
of
the
sections
of
the
statute.
may
i
ask
the
court
to
turn
therefore
to
the
same
comparative
print
once
more
that
is
labeled
at
numbers
88
and
111,
and
look
at
page
2
where
with
the
typography,
we've
shown
what
happened
to
the
statute.
as
it
originally
stood
taking
the
roman
type,
the
statute
made
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents,
to
engage
in
or
induce
or
encourage
the
employees
of
any
employer
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
a
concerted
refusal
in
the
course
of
their
employment
to
do
certain
things.
to
use
manufacture,
process,
transport
or
otherwise
handle
or
work
on
any
goods
and
so
forth,
or
to
perform
any
services,
and
then
it
goes
on
for
one
of
the
prohibited
objectives.
here
the
objective
of
inducing
the
secondary
employer
not
to
sell
the
primary
employer's
goods
or
not
deal
with
the
primary
employer.
the
time
the
statute
as
it
stood
after
1947,
you'll
note
that
there
were
four
requirements
which
one
had
to
prove
to
make
out
the
unfair
labor
practice,
but
first
there
had
to
be
inducement
or
encouragement.
there
had
to
be
second
inducement
or
encouragement
of
employees
of
any
employer.
and
then
they
had
to
be
induced
to
engage
in
a
certain
kind
of
conduct
to
strike
or
to,
for
a
shorthand
i'd
say,
withhold
employment
services
to
work
on
goods
and
so
and
so
forth
that
withhold
services,
and
then
forth
when
that
proved
that
the
union
has
an
objective
forbidden
by
the
statute.
then
the
change
was
made
in
1959,
the
only
change
that
congress
made
was
in
this
respect,
was
to
strike
out
the
phrase
the
employees
of
any
employer
and
put
in
any
individual
employed
by
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
or
any
industry
affecting
commerce.
that
change
was
made
to
cover
what
almost
everyone
agreed
with
loopholes
in
the
original
version.
the
terms
employees
and
employer
had
technical
definitions
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
they
excluded
a
number
of
kinds
of
persons,
excluded
all
railway
employees
so
that
you
could
induce
railway
employees
not
to
carry
that
goods
of
any
primary
employee.
they
excluded
public
employees,
the
school
district
employees,
and
the
like.
they
also,
and
the
important
here,
excluded
supervisors,
alright.
it
meant,
for
example,
that
you
could
induce
the
foreman
on
a
loading
dock
of
a
trucking
company
to
refuse
to
do
their
work,
or
the
working
foreman
out
of
construction
job
to
refuse
to
do
their
work
because
they
were
supervisors
and
not
included
within
the
statute.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
change,
this
is
shown
by
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief,
was
to
cause
those
loopholes.
it
read
any
individual
employed
by
any
person,
the
use
of
the
word
“employ”
may
have
been
a
little
unfortunate
but
employ
wasn't
defined
in
considering
that
the
change
was
made,
the
congress
apparently
thought
there
wasn't
too
much
danger
that
the
border
the
court
would
miss
the
point.
but
the
only
change
i
submit
was
made
in
this
second
of
the
four
requirements
to
whom
the
inducement
or
encouragement
was
to
be
addressed.
and
there
was
not
any
change
in
the
third
of
the
four
requirements
i
mentioned
as
to
the
kinds
of
things
that
they
were
to
be
induced
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
relevant
here
but
i
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
your
honor
is
entirely
correct
but
that
perhaps
you
should
say
another
word,
alright.
in
connection
with
that
and
this
comes
up
in
the
next
case,
after
this
case.
in
connection
with
that
there
is
a
proviso
on
page
3
that
has
to
do
--
provided
that
nothing
in
this
clause
would
be
construed
to
make
unlawful,
were
not
otherwise
unlawful
in
a
primary
strike
to
primary
picket.
this
has
to
do
with
the
truck
drivers
coming
to
the
primary
location
and
the
fear
that
striking
out
concerted
might
mean
that
you
couldn't
induce
one
truck
driver
not
to
go
into
the
primary
location.
but
this
is
not
relevant
here
basically,
i'm
sorry
if
i
mislead
--
if
i
slipped
over
it,
because
it
doesn't
matter
here.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
while
there
was
a
change
as
to
who
and
the
broadening,
as
to
whom
it
was
an
illegal
to
induce.
there
was
no
change
with
respect
to
what
you
couldn't
induce
them
to
do,
and
therefore
what
you
were
left
free
to
induce
them
to
do.
that
made
because
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
this
case
to
put
to
simple,
or
perhaps
childishly
simple
examples.
suppose
that
they
--
the
garment
workers
union
were
in
dispute
with
a
contractor
that
live
chiefly
on
borrowed
capital,
went
to
the
bank,
the
finance
keeper,
and
said,
“we
want
you
to
cut
off
his
line
of
credit
as
long
as
he
employs
people
at
substandard
wages
under
filthy
working
conditions”
and
so
forth.
and
if
the
bank
refused
to
cut
off
his
credit,
the
union
then
induced
the
17
vice-presidents
to
go
on
strike.
under
the
earlier
statute,
the
vice-presidents
would
have
been
the
supervisory
capacity,
the
statute
clearly
would
not
apply
to
them.
the
board
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
and
some
of
its
other
opinions,
they
suggested
that
maybe
the
statute
wouldn't
apply
to
them
at
all.
but
i
concede
with
the
board's
full
approval
for
the
purposely
argument
of
this
case
that
the
change
in
putting
individual
employed
by,
would
cover
the
vice-presidents
and
that
inducing
the
17
of
them
to
go
on
strike
would
be
a
violation
of
the
8
(b)
(4)
(i).
but
suppose
now
the
union,
in
a
dispute
again
with
my
garment
employer,
went
to
the
vice-president
who
handled
the
line
of
credits
for
the
clothing
industry
and
said,
“if
the
garment
union
had
done
to
as
i
suggested
yesterday
to
retailers
buying
the
products
of
some
of
these
sweatshops,
that
we
think
you
should
finance
this
kind
of
enterprise.
and
we
wish
to
persuade
you
not
to
do
it.”
the
vice-president
thought
it
over
and
said,
“well,
i
agree
with
you.
it's
bad
for
the
community.
it's
bad
for
the
bank
to
be
financing
such
an
enterprise.
i
will
exercise
the
discretion
vested
in
me
by
this
corporation
and
not
to
extend
any
more
credit.”
that
we
say
and
we
think
it's
quite
clear,
would
not
be
an
inducement
to
engage
even
though
you
leave
out
concerted,
mr.
justice
stewart,
would
not
be
an
inducement
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
a
refusal
to
use,
manufacture,
process,
transport,
or
otherwise
handle
their
work
and
any
goods,
or
to
perform
any
services.
he'd
be
performing
these
services.
he'd
be
doing
what
the
employer
had
set
him
up
there
to
do
and
even
if
he
simply
made
a
recommendation
to
the
committee
on
loans
instead
of
deciding
it
for
himself,
he
would
still
be
performing
his
job.
and
we
think
that
it
would
fail,
the
case
against
the
bank
would
fail
not
because
of
the
second
requirement
but
because
of
the
third,
that
it'd
be
an
inducement
to
do
this
kind
of
thing.
now,
i
say
that
by
a
second
bank
case
is
this
very
case
that
the
inducement
to
the
managers
here
was
not
to
withhold
their
employment
services,
it
was
to
do
their
job
to
decide
from
whom
these
grocery
stores
would
buy
and
whose
products
they
would
sell.
and
that
if
they
didn't
have
the
sole
discretion
to
make
that
decision
of
sales
then
it
was
a
request
to
them
to
go
to
their
boss
and
give
him
a
recommendation
and
they're
urging
what
was
better
for
the
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
--
i
think
that
it
permits
that
reading
literally
but
i
think
that
the
whole
sense
of
it
having
in
mind
of
the
string
of
words
that's
beginning
with
strike
or
a
concerted
refusal
and
that
concerted
being
talking
out
solely
because
of
the
problem
of
inducing
one
various
skill
the
employee
not
to
do
his
job
and
the
concluding
expression,
or
to
perform
any
services,
and
this
being
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
all
suggest
that
it
means
the
refusal
to
do
your
job,
the
job
for
which
the
employer
hired
you
rather
than
to
exercise
a
managerial
discretion.
now,
if
there's
any
doubt,
that
i
would
submit
or
induce
(inaudible),
that
this
issue
would
have
to
be
resolved
the
way
we
urge
mr.
justice
by
the
history
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
that
i
discussed
yesterday.
you
will
remember
that
when
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
was
first
proposed
as
it
was
by
the
eisenhower
administration
then
came
up
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
one
of
the
questions
that
was
raised
is
will
this
prohibit
a
union
from
going
to
a
secondary
employment
and
seeking
to
persuade
him
for
his
own
good,
but
i
don't
mean
that
with
any
kind
of
threatened
implication
of
reprisal,
for
his
good
and
the
good
of
the
community
and
as
a
decent
human
being,
that
he
shouldn't
continue
to
do
business
with
the
employer,
with
whom
the
union
has
its
dispute.
and
everybody
agreed
that
there
was
no
intentions
in
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
to
block
that
kind
of
approach
to
the
secondary
employer.
and
there
were
notable
instances,
i
think
i
mentioned
one
yesterday,
in
labor
history
where
that
has
been
done.
i
would
think
that
this
isn't
the
fact.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
would
have
been
--
the
premise
of
that
whole
discussion
must
have
been
that
8
(b)
(4)
(i)
didn't
reach
this.
it
would
have
been
--
and
of
course
remember,
there
had
been
experience
under
8
(b)
(4)
(i).
the
words
to
which
you
called
attention
were
in
its
earlier
version
and
i
don't
pitch
my
case
on
the
word
“induce
or
encourage”,
but
on
what
they
were
induced
or
encouraged
to
do.
it's
with
conduct
not
the
word,
“induce
or
encourage”,
they
have
been
given
the
very
broadest
interpretation
that
i'm
not
quarrelling
with
that.
now,
it
would
mean
that
this
whole
discussion
over
the
right
to
try
to
persuade
an
employer
to
cut
off
a
customer
or
not
to
deal
with
the
particular
source
of
supply
was
meaningless
if
this
was
covered
by
8
(b)
(4)
(i),
not
quite
meaningless,
i
overstated
just
a
little
bit.
it
would
mean
that
you
could
apply
it
to
an
individual,
then
an
individual
entrepreneur,
provided
he
was
small
enough,
so
the
request
was
made
to
the
fellows
who
run
the
business.
but
it
seems
to
me
very
hard
to
see
how
you
could
apply
it
to
anyone
else
and
surely
everybody
assumed
knowing
the
way
modern
business
is
conducted
that
the
approach
would
be
made
to
a
sales
manager
or
to
a
manager
who
apply
it
to.
to
whoever
may
be
the
fellow
had
authority
to
make
these
decisions
and
that
if
you
got
the
person
who
didn't
have
authority
to
make
the
decision,
that
he
at
least
could
put
it
up
to
someone
else,
to
tell
his
boss
what
had
happened
and
urge
them
to
do
it.
now,
of
course,
i
still
have
a
problem
under
8
(b)
(4)
(ii).
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
was
no
necessarily
--
that
there
isn't
a
problem
under
that
section.
but
i
think
under
this
section,
the
simple
fact
is
that
it
wasn't
an
inducement
or
encouragement
to
withhold
employment
services,
that
it
wasn't
a
--
and
request
as
to
how
those
services
should
be
performed.
now,
as
i
understand
the
respondent's
brief,
they
don't
quarrel
very
much
with
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
indeed,
i
wouldn't
think
one
could
or
wouldn't
have
thought
that
could,
alright.
what
they
say
is
that
well
the
managers
didn't
have
any
authority
to
decide
that
the
stores
wouldn't
handle
this
product.
the
two
very
short
answers
to
that
contention,
one
is
that
the
finding
to
the
board
are
squarely
against
the
respondents
on
that
very
point
of
the
trial
examiner
at
page
27
and
over
on
28
of
this
record
found
the
managers
of
mcdaniel's
markets,
that's
one
of
the
chains,
were
authorized
to
decide
as
they
best
could
whether
they'd
continue
doing
business
with
servette
in
the
face
of
threatened
or
actual
hand
on.
this
policy
decision
was
one
for
them
to
make.
the
evidence
is
persuasive,
the
same
authority
was
best
in
the
managers
of
kory.
none
of
these
managers
i
find
that
was
in
any
respect
refusing
to
perform
services
for
his
respective
employer.
the
agency
was
empowered
to
do
and
decided
what
course
of
action
would
best
solve
the
dilemma
with
which
he
was
faced.
i
see
no
way
of
getting
around
that
finding.
and
second,
even
if
the
finding
were
there
--
weren't
there,
i
think
i
would
argue
that
the
request
here
even
if
it
was
made
to
the
wrong
person,
was
still
a
request
to
make
a
business
decision
and
not
a
request
not
to
do
your
job
as
an
employee.
i
think
one
way
of
testing
that
is
to
suppose
how
the
conversation
might
have
gone
as
so
far
as
we
know
it
didn't,
but
might
have
gone,
and
probably
would
have
gone
but
if
the
store
manager,
one
of
the
kory's
markets
had
said,
“well
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
have
any
authority
to
stop
handling
the
servette
products.
the
boss
has
told
me
to
sell
all
the
servette
products,
i
can.
i've
got
to
do
what
he
said.”
it
seems
to
me
that
on
this
record,
it's
inconceivable
if
the
reply
would
have
been,
“well
we
want
you
to
stop
anyway,
disobey
your
boss,
don't
do
your
job.”
that
isn't
what
the
union
was
getting
at.
the
reply
would
have
been,
“alright
then,
we're
going
to
handbill
the
store.”
and
the
pressure
would
have
fallen
on
the
employer
not
on
the
store
manager.
or
the
reply
might
have
been,
“well
you
better
tell
your
boss
because
if
you
keep
on
selling
them,
we're
going
to
handbill
the
store.”
but
i
can't
see
any
evidence
that
there
was
an
inducement
to
do
something
that
would
be
in
a
sense
a
breach
of
loyal
--
the
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
boss
or
being
disobedient
of
the
boss'
instruction,
or
be
a
refusal
to
perform
the
service
issue
owed
him,
and
that
surely
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
8
(b)
(4)
(i)
has
always
been
supposed
to
deal
with.
alright,
so
we
think
that
the
heart
of
this
case
is
really
under
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
that
the
question
is
whether
the
handbilling
or
the
threats
to
handbill
come
under
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
by
8
(b)
(4)
(ii)
that
that's
where
it
fits
in,
in
terms
of
the
discussion
of
the
legislative
history
with
the
previous
history
of
8
(b)
(4)
(i)
and
this
is
the
one
which
the
language
most
naturally
covers.
the
board,
in
its
treatment
of
the
case,
assumed
they
did
not
decide
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
has
never
ruled
on
the
question,
but
it
assumed
that
the
handbilling
or
the
threat
to
handbill
would
constitute
a
threat,
coercion,
or
a
restraint
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
part
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(ii).
in
other
words,
the
board
did
assume
in
its
decision
of
the
case
that
absent
of
proviso,
there
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
subsequently,
when
the
case
--
when
its
order
have
been
set
aside
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
board
has
to
have
the
case
remanded
so
that
it
might
consider
whether
the
handbilling
was
a
violation
of
the
8
(b)
(4)
(ii).
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
through
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
said
that
the
question
wasn't
raised
in
the
proceedings
before
the
board
and
that
it
was
therefore
too
late
to
raise
it
after
the
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
we
didn't
bring
that
question
here,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
i
have
planned
to
treat
it
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
this
particular
case
of
the
handbilling
constituted
coercion
or
restraint
and
that
saying
“we'll
handbill”
was
to
threat.
after
all
it
is
a
threat
that
you
have
a
lot
of
spoiled
products
on
your
hands
and
if
you
said,
“we'll
destroy
all
your
servette
product,
we'll
blow
them
up,”
i
suppose
that
would
certainly
be
a
threat
and
if
they
rot,
it
would
stand
to
be
a
threat
too.
so
the
case
really
turns
this
aspect
to
the
case
on
this
proviso
on
page
4
of
the
comparative
print.
provided
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
paragraph
4,
nothing
contained
in
such
paragraph
should
be
construed
to
prohibit
publicity
other
than
picketing.
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public
--
i
see
that
the
red
light
is
on.
i'll
finish
the
sentence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
discussing
the
second
of
the
two
issues
in
this
case,
i'd
come
to
the
point,
just
before
the
recess,
of
calling
attention
on
our
comparative
print
to
the
long
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
which
appears
on
page
4
of
the
little
pamphlet.
it
provides
that,
for
the
purposes
of
paragraph
4,
nothing
contained
in
the
paragraph
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
publicity,
other
than
picketing,
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public,
including
consumers
and
members
of
the
labor
organization,
that
a
product
or
products
are
produced
by
an
employer
with
whom
the
labor
organization
has
a
primary
dispute,
that
here
would
of
course
be
servette,
and
are
distributed
by
another
employer,
that
here
would
be
the
chain
stores,
as
long
as
the
picketing
doesn't
have
certain
effects,
and
no
one
suggests
that
it
has
those
effects
in
this
case.
so,
the
question
is
whether
picketing
at
the
retail
stores
falls
within
the
language
of
covering
p
--
i
said
the
picketing,
i'm
getting
confused.
the
handbilling
at
the
retail
stores
falls
within
the
language
“publicity
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
public
that
a
product
or
products
are
produced
by
one
employer
and
distributed
by
a
secondary
employer.”
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
--
yes,
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
and
i'm
coming
to
that.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i'm
sorry.
i
just
meant
to
get
the
relationship.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
concerned,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
there
have
been
three
views
advanced
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
proviso.
one
view
is
that
advanced
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
case,
but
most
notably
in
a
case
known
as
the
great
western
broadcasting
company
case
which
was
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
before
this
case
in
an
authority
of
--
which
case,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case.
the
board
there
suggested
that
the
proviso
should
be
read
so
broadly
that
it
covered
virtually
all
publicity.
i
can
state
its
interpretation
best
by
giving
a
concrete
illustration
based
on
the
great
western
broadcasting
case.
there,
the
labor
union
was
in
a
dispute
with
the
broadcasting
station.
the
station
advertised
a
number
of
products.
one
of
them,
i'm
imagining,
but
one
of
the
products
was
sunoco
gasoline.
the
union,
getting
nowhere
in
its
dispute
with
the
television
or
broadcasting
station,
picketed
the
sunoco
stores
or
the
downtown
department
store,
if
you
will,
who's
--
which
advertised
over
the
radio
station.
the
board
took
the
view
that
the
radio
station
was
engaged,
in
an
economic
sense,
in
helping
to
produce
sunoco
gasoline
and
that
sunoco
gasoline
was
being
distributed
by
the
sunoco
filling
stations
and,
therefore,
it
came
within
the
proviso.
in
this
case,
while
the
board
does
not
give
up
that
meaning,
it
agrees
with
me
that
the
case
doesn't
require
so
broad
an
interpretation.
but
personally,
i
find
that
interpretation
extremely
difficult
and
we
think
it
can
go
on
a
narrower
ground
but,
it
should
be
understood,
that
is
one
of
the
meanings
of
the
statute
that
has
been
put
forward
but
i'm
not
arguing
it
here.
now,
the
other
extreme
is
the
interpretation
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
says
that
produce
--
product
or
products
produced
by
an
employer
means
the
manufacturer
who
makes
it
or
perhaps
who
processes
it.
he
would
be
the
manufacturer
or
processor
and
carries
it
no
farther.
the
interpretation
that
we
advocate
in
this
case
lies
midway
between.
we
urge
that
the
word
"produced"
should
be
given
the
same
meaning
in
this
statute
that
it
has
been
given
in
other
labor
legislation,
most
notably
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
have
specific
definitions
of
these
terms
and
differs
from
this
statute
in
that
respect.
it
defines
“produce
or
production”
to
include
producing,
manufacturing,
mining,
handling,
transporting
or,
in
any
other
manner,
working
on
any
goods.
and,
it
has
been
held
many,
many
times
that
a
wholesaler
of
goods
who
packages
and
repackages,
sometimes
he
labels,
sometimes
he
doesn't,
and
sometimes
he
puts
in
smaller
lots
what
he
receives
in
large
lots,
who
certainly
handles
the
goods
as
well
as
stores
them
and
distributes
them
is
engaged
in
producing
within
the
meaning
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and,
we
say
that
the
word
must
be
taken
in
that
sense
here
so
that
there
is,
under
our
view
as
we
urge
it,
some
following
of
the
physical
product.
it
doesn't
involve
this
virtually
any
economic
relationship
that
contributes
to
the
ultimate
sale
of
the
product,
but
says
that
the
union
comes
within
the
proviso
if
the
person
with
whom
it
had
its
dispute
produced
it
in
this
sense
and
if
the
person
who
is
selling
it
and
whom
it
is
handbilling
is
distributing
it
in
the
sense
of
getting
it
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
we
think
there
are
essentially
four
reasons
for
construing
the
proviso,
at
least
that
broadly.
the
first
and,
in
a
sense,
the
second
i've
already
inverted
to.
"produced"
was
a
word
that
had
a
well-known
meaning
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
men
who
participated
in
the
drafting
of
this
statute
were,
well,
must
have
been
well-aware
of
its
meaning
and
the
definition
in
the
act
and
the
interpretation
put
upon
it.
we
think
where
there
are
two
statutes
in
the
same
general
field,
the
labor
area,
there's
a
strong
presumption
that
congress
used
the
word
in
the
same
senses.
we
feel
strength
in
that
by
the
fact--
by
the
case
united
states
against
montgomery
ward
and
company
which,
some
of
you
may
recall,
grew
out
of
the
seizure
by
the
president
during
world
war
ii
of
the
wholesaling
and
mail
order
business
in
montgomery
ward.
there
was
no
authority
for
that
seizure
under
the
war
labor
disputes
act,
unless
it
could
be
said
that
montgomery
ward
was
engaged
in
producing
war
materials,
but
they
were
a
mail
order
house
or
a
wholesaler
and
had
some
retail
stores,
too.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
meaning
of
“produced”
in
the
war
labor
disputes
act,
also
it
contained
no
artificial
definition,
must
be
taken
to
be
the
same
as
the
meaning
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
answer
is
partly,
your
honor.
let
me
explicate
what
i
mean.
i
would
say,
no,
it
did
not
incorporate
the
definition
by
reference.
it
did
--
the
provision
you're
thinking
of
is
a
provision
which
directed
the
war
labor
board
in
rendering
its
recommendations
on
labor
disputes,
decisions
in
the
substantive
sense,
to
be
guided
by
the
provisions
of
various
laws,
including
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
this,
certainly,
tended
to
bring
the
two
statutes
together
and
i
think,
in
that
sense,
perhaps
made
that
a
somewhat
easier
case,
so
far
as
the
words
are
concerned,
than
this
one.
but,
the
court
went
upon
the
theory
that
they
--
statutes
were
in
pari
materia.
i
think
there
was
no
ex
--
i
don't
think
there
can
be
said
to
be
any
fair
incorporation
by
reference
of
the
definitions
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
case
rests
on
their
being
in
pari
materia
more
than
on
that
section
to
which
your
honor
refers.
now,
there
is
another
thing
about
that
opinion,
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
in
that
case,
said
quite
apart
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
definition
of
“produced”
which
still
find
this
was
produced
within
the
meaning
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
so,
that,
i
think
is
--
again
tends
to
cut
in
my
--
in
my
favor.
with
that
background,
we
think
there
is
a
--
the
words
would
be
a
very
strong
inference
that
the
word
“produced”
was
used
in
the
technical
sense
that
had
been
used
elsewhere
in
the
labor
law.
but,
i
certainly
can't
say
that
that
mere
background
excludes
necessarily
the
other
interpretation.
the
additional
facts
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
important
is
that
there
were
a
number
of
rather
well-known
common
law
decisions
holding
that
a
union
may
follow
a
product
through
--
to
the
various
stages
of
distribution
and
that
the
employers
injured
along
the
way,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
were
not
truly
neutrals.
we've
sited
some
of
those
in
our
brief,
and
some
of
those
cases
dealt
with
situations
where
the
primary
employer
was
not
a
manufacturer
alone
and
we
think
that,
remembering
that
this
legislation
was,
to
a
considerable
extent,
a
battle
of
experts,
that
common
law
theory
ties
in
with
the
meaning
that
we
would
give
the
words
here.
finally,
i
would
stress
this
is
a
proper
interpretation
because
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
there
are
perhaps
or
are
at
worst,
from
our
point
of
view,
two
possible
meanings
of
the
words.
one
would
be
to
read
“produced”
as
a
word
of
art,
such
as
it
had
become
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
same
meaning
in
the
sense
of
art
that
was
given
in
montgomery
ward,
and
the
other
perhaps
is
to
take
it
more
narrowly
because
there
is
legislation
where
it
has
been
read
more
narrowly.
but,
given
those
two
interpretations
and
given
the
fact
that
if
--
that
this
statute,
absent
the
proviso,
would
be
a
restriction
upon
all
forms
of
communication
of
the
fact
of
the
dispute,
not
only
handbilling
but
radio
advertising,
newspaper
publicity,
and
so
forth,
that
the
proviso
should
be
construed
broadly
in
order
to
avoid
curtailing
a
method
--
methods
of
expression,
of
publicity,
of
communication,
all
be
an
expression
and
communication
in
a
context
of
an
economic
dispute.
and,
that
desire,
which
appears
quite
clearly
in
the
legislative
history,
and
the
importance
of
preserving
that
right
seemed
to
us
to
be
enough
to
resolve
any
doubt
that
the
words
and
the
other
materials
i
mentioned
leave
about
the
meaning
of
"produced"
and
to
require
giving
it
at
least
as
broad
an
interpretation
as
it
has
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
issues
had
been
made
clear.
thank
you,
your
honor.
unless
the
court
wishes
a
reply,
i've
taken
enough
time
today.
