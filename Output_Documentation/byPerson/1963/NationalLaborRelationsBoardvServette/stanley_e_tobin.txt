mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
does
not
have
any
major
differences
with
the
board's
general
analysis,
overall
construction,
or
statutory
scheme
of
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
1959
amendments.
indeed,
on
major
points,
responded
was
fully
--
in
full
agreement
with
the
board's
position,
particularly
as
expressed
in
the
tree
fruits
case.
i
might
add
here
at
the
beginning
that
even
if
this
court
should
not
decide
that
coercion
per
se
is
proper
and
the
proper
interpretation
in
the
tree
fruits
case,
as
i
will
later
expand
upon,
there
was
coercion
in
fact
in
the
servette
case.
and,
the
record
so
points
out.
a
significant
difference,
in
our
respective
positions,
in
the
fact
situation
before
this
court
is
that
the
board,
without
any
justification,
we
submit
-
one,
sharply
restricted
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term
"any
individual"
as
it
appear
in
8
(b)(4)(i)
and,
two,
has
greatly
brought
in
the
phrase
“a
product
or
products
that
are
produced
by
an
employer
with
whom
the
labor
organization
has
a
primary
dispute
and
are
distributed
by
another
employer,”
as
it
appears
in
the
second
exception
proviso
for
section
8
(b)(4)(ii).
by
such
an
exercise
of
statutory
construction,
the
board
has
not
only
macerated
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
language
but
has
nullified
congressional
intent.
like
the
procrustean
bed,
the
board
has
adopted
the
technique
in
this
case
that
if
the
traveler
is
too
long,
you
cut
him
down
to
fit
the
bed
and,
if
he
is
too
short,
like
in
producer,
you
stretch
him
to
fit
the
bed's
dimensions.
in
the
first
issue
before
this
court,
the
question
involved
is
whether
individuals,
store
managers,
and
supervisors
of
the
chain
store
supermarkets
who
are
approached
by
the
union
agents
and
were
induced
and
encouraged
not
to
handle
or
sell
products
distributed
by
a
respondent
or
to
do
business
with
respondent
or
individuals
with
the
meaning
of
the
act.
i
submit
the
issue
between
myself
and
my
client
and,
on
one
hand,
and
the
solicitor
general
and
the
board,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
very
narrow
one.
the
board
would
set,
initially,
that
“any
individual”
does
not
mean
any
individual,
but
only
include
certain
individuals.
from
the
outset,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
statute
is
not
always
open
to
construction
but
only
where
the
language
used
in
the
statute
requires
interpretation.
where
the
statute
is
ambiguous
or
as
of
such
doubtful
or
obscure
meaning
that
reasonable
minds
can
--
might
be
uncertain
or
disagree
as
to
its
meaning.
where
the
language
of
a
statute
is
plain
and
non-ambiguous
and
conveys
a
clear
and
definite
meaning,
there
is
no
occasion
resorting
to
the
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
and
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
--
court
gen
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and
i'm
getting--
i'm
getting
to
that.i
mean,
in
this
instance,
we're
first
starting
out
that
if
we
are
to
make
exceptions
to
the
word
“individual,”
we
ought
to
make
those
very
limited
exceptions.
now,
the
1950
--
prior
to
the
1959
amendments,
8
(b)(4)(a),
the
antecedent
of
(i),
prohibit
a
law--
labor
organization,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
from
encouraging
the
employees
of
any
employer.
and
a
big
--
and,
of
course,
because
supervisors,
among
others,
were
not
within
that
statutory
term
definition,
it
was
felt
that
this
was
a
major
loophole.
the
solicitor
general,
in
this
article
he
has
written,
readily
admitted
that
supervisors
“obviously”
are
now
included
within
the
act.
he,
nor
no
other
commentator,
made
any
distinction
between
high
level
supervisors
and
low
level
supervisors,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
board's
original
decision
and
opinion
in
this
matter.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
they
switched.
they
have
now
begun
to
switch
and
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear,
justice
stewart,
if
i
might.
the
congressional
debates
point
out
quite
clearly
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
here
was
to
protect
an
employer,
a
secondary
employer
particularly,
from
having
his
employees,
meaning
in
the
broad
sense
now,
not
in
a
statutory
definition
sense,
be
subject
to
this
type
of
inducement
and
encouragement.
the
reason
being
that
these
type
of
employees,
including
supervisors,
and
the
legislative
debates
go
into
this
at
some
length,
found
that
these
supervisors
were
subject
to,
either
because
they
were
members
of
the
union,
subject
to
union
discipline
or,
as
ex-members,
were
sympathetic
with
it
or
who,
because
they
work
with
the
rank-and-file
employees,
have
the
same
economic
ideals
and
outlook
and
philosophy
as
a
normal
employee.
thus,
they
sought
to
close
this
loophole.
now,
i
would
agree.
in
fact,
i
would,
first,
agree
right
of
the
start
that
the
solicitor
general
is
probably
correct
when
he
says
that
the
statutory
scheme
would
be
destroyed
by
including
all
individuals
within
that
position.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
that's
correct.
in
that
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
in
that
sense,
but
i'm
trying
to
explain
here
now
what
a
trial
examiner
did
on
this
minneapolis
furnishing
case
which
was
the
basis
of
what
he
had.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
that
is
correct.
i
can
see
that
we
will
go,
in
order
to
make
sense
of
it,
beyond
the
statute.
the
trial
examiner
in
the
minneapolis
case,
cited
i
believe
on
page
19
of
my
brief,
pointed
out
that
when
you
speak
of
corporate
officers
and
directors,
the
analogy
given
by
the
solicitor
general,
you're
actually
talking
about
the
employer
and
you
don't
even
have
to
think
in
the
terms
of
agency
in
that
regard.
including
corporate
officers
who
act
as
the
employer
in
the
full
sense
in
understanding
of
common
powers,
to
include
them
with
an
individual
does
not
thwart
congressional
intent
and
does
not
really
strain
the
statute
to
its
outer
limits.
if
you
do
include
corporate
officers,
the
scheme
which
the
solicitor
general
and
the
board
wishes
to
maintain
is
held
entirely
intact.on
the
other
hand,
store
managers
of
large
retail
chain
supermarkets
who
work
together
with
other
store
employees
are
certainly
supervisors.
now,
i
think
that
the
board
recognized
this
halfway
up
in
this
litigation
because
they
abandoned
that
idea
that
store
managers
beca
--
the
idea
of
high
level
and
low
level
supervisors
per
se
and,
before
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
they
now
argue
that
these
store
managers,
all
of
them
presumably,
had
the
delegated
authority
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
do
business
with
servette.
and,
i
suggest
and
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
case
here
can
be
narrowly
decided
on
that
very
question.
the
evidence
shows
overwhelmingly
that
this
is
not
a
fact.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
if
it
were,
i
would
suggest
this,
your
honor.
i
think
that
congressional
intent
may
be
thwarted
because,
again,
we
have
the
same
old
story
of
employees
or
people
not
--
not
having
the
outlook
of
the
employers
are
going
to
be
subject
to
this.
but,
for
this
case,
i
would
concede.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right.
now
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
should
like
to
mention
that,
justice
goldberg.
the
trial
examiner
made
a
finding
that
the
managers
of
mcdaniels
and
kory
had
such
authority.
where
he
got
that
fact,
no
one
knows.
the
general
counsel
vigorously
opposed
it
in
his
exceptions
and,
when
it
went
up
on
appeal,
the
issue
was
not
raised
at
that
time
because
the
circuit
court
did
not
reach
it.
now,
the
record
is
a
very
short
one.
the
record
is
entirely
uncontradicted.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
there
were
--
the
evidence
was
not
taken
in
this
--
upon
this
evidence,
was
not
taken
by
witnesses
but
was
taken
by
stipulation.
so,
therefore,
at
the
very
least,
the
universal
camera
would
dictate
that
the
--
that
the
findings
of
a
trial
examiner
are
subject
to
review
and,
on
that
short
record
of
uncontradicted
evidence,
it
shows,
one,
the
manager
of
one
kory's
department,
when
approached
by
the
agents
of
the
union
to
take
the
products
off
the
shelves,
said
“i'll
have
to
speak
to
my
supervisor.”
this
is
the
man
that
they're
now
calling
a
high
level
supervisor
saying,
“i'll
have
to
speak
to
my
supervisor
to
find
out
what
to
do.”
another
manager
said,
“when
approached
similarly,
i'll
have
to
find
out
from
the
front
office.”
a
third
one
said,
“i
will
have
to
speak
to
my
superior.”
that
is
exactly
the
position
that
the
board
here
now
says
that
these
type
of
people
should
not
be
--
should
be
included
in
the
definition
of
“individual.”
but,
they
have
swung
away
from
that
now
and
they
did
it
on
one
simple
statement
in
the
file
of
the
trial
examiner's
findings
which,
incidentally,
the
board
did
not
go
into
but
just
have
simply
--
based
its
decision
on
the
carolina
products
case
which
spoke
of
high
level
and
low
level
supervisors.
and,
when
the
board
was
respondent
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
again
argued
the
high
and
low
level
thing
as
though
they
were
status.
it's
won
gold
from
here
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
that
one.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
that
one
was
enough
and
you
have
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and,
in
so
doing
and
so
--
and
in
so
twisting,
i
believe
the
record
in
using
the
“phrase
delegated
authority
to
make
this
decision.”
they
took
one
instance
where
one
store
manager
was
approached
by
the
union,
asked
to
take
the
products
off
the
shelf,
and
the
store
manager
said,
“no,
i'll
have
to
speak
to
my
superiors
before
i
do
anything.”
a
week
later,
the
various
store
managers
had
a
meeting
of
some
kind
with
the
“company
officials,”
and
the
company
officials
told
them,
which
is
probably
what
happens
in
many
instances,
“we
don't
want
to
do,
do
whatever
you
wish.”
this,
the
trial
examiner
and
now
the
board
says,
shows
that
this
store
--
this
--
all
store
managers
had
the
authority
to
make
decisions.
well,
first
of
all,
it
only
applied
to
one
store
manager
of
a
numerous
ones
in
the
state
of
facts.
and,
secondly,
it
does
--
it
does
not
support
the
petitioner
here.
it
undermines
his
argument
because
it
shows,
at
the
time
that
the
union
officials
came,
the
time
they
committed
the
proscribed
activity,
this
particular
store
manager
had
no
such
authority.
on
that
ground,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
8
(b)(4)(i)
and
the
board's
decision
below
is
fully
supported.
the
second
issue
--
the
second
major
issue
before
this
court
is
that
involving
8
(b)(4)(ii).
both,
the
board
throughout
these
proceedings
and
the
respondent,
agree
that
the
union's
activities
in
distributing
handbills
outside
of
supermarkets
requesting
potential
customers
not
to
purchase
the
goods
purportedly
distributed
by
servette
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(b)(4)(ii)
in
as
much
as
the
union
coerced
and
restrained
the
market
employers
with
the
object
of
forcing
them
to
cease
doing
business
with
servette.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
well,
i
think
it's
quite
important
to
this
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
well,
you
can
--
the
board
can
--
the
court,
i'm
sure,
can
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
based
upon--
based
upon
a
small
(i),
but
there
were
additional
unfair
labor
practices
which
--
and
the
board
has
taken
the
position
in
regard
to
fiduciary
product,
which
i
think
is
before
this
court.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary.
the
board
add
--
but,
the
board
add
the
second
proviso
to
8
(b)(4),
protects
the
threats
of
handbilling
and
handbilling
of
the
union
in
this
case.
respondent
agrees
with
the
position
rather
of
the
dissenting
member
of
the
board
to
the
effect
that
the
proviso
in
the
fact
situation,
the
instant
case,
does
not
protect
this
otherwise
conceited
illegal
activities.
initially,
we
must
recognize
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
exemption,
not
with
the
statutor--
statute's
primary
coverage.
ordinarily,
exemptions
are
not
fatal.
if
the
exemption
is
dubious,
it
is
not
given
effect.
if
ambiguous,
it
is
resolved
strictly
in
favor
of
the
statute's
application.
here,
the
crux
of
the
difference
is
the
phrase,
“a
product
of
products
produced
by
an
employer
with
whom
a
labor
organization
has
a
primary
dispute
and
is
distributed
by
another
employer.”
so,
that
is
a
distributor
of
products
produced
by
other
employers
and
is
not
itself
a
producer
of
anything.
the
board,
in
adopting
an
uncommon
and
far-reaching
definition
of
the
term,
appears
to
speculate
that
if
congress
really
had
considered
this,
they
would
have
included
a
broader
term.
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
mcboyle
case,
283
u.s.
25,27,
when
a
rule
of
conduct
is
laid
down
in
words
that
evoke,
in
the
common
mind,
only
the
picture
of
vehicles
moving
on
land,
the
statute
should
not
be
extended
to
aircraft
simply
because
it
may
seem
to
us
that
a
similar
policy
applies
or
upon
the
speculation
that
if
the
legislature
had
thought
of
it,
very
likely,
broader
words
would
have
been
used.
in
fact,
the
court
took
the
same
similar
position
in
western
union
telegraph
v.
lenroot.
as
an
analysis
of
the
exception
proviso
and
its
history
indicates
clearly,
we
submit,
that
congress
meant
to
limit
the
exemption
to
producers
of
products
as
that
term
is
commonly
understood.
to
begin
we
--
begin
with,
it
is
well
known
that
the
original
bill
which
passed
the
senate
contain
no
further
restrictions
than
then
existing
upon
the
union's
right
to
engage
in
secondary
boycott
activity.
the
house
bill
on
the
other
hand,
precluded
any
kind
of
secondary
boycott
activity.
at
the
conference
stage,
virtual
agreement
was
reached
except
for
the
secondary
boycott
provisions.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
written,
the
house
stood
immovably
upon
its
position.
the
senate
conferees
were
only
able
to
obtain
the
proviso,
permitting
publicity
other
than
picketing
in
a
very
narrow
and
limited
situations.
the
final
compromise
between
the
senate
and
house
bill
--
and
the
house
bill
did
not
merely
relate
to
publicity
other
than
picketing.
it
also
--
it
also
limited
permissible
secondary
boycotts
to
those
involved
in
the
distribution
of
products
produced
by
a
producer
with
whom
the
labor
organization
has
a
dispute.
i
believe
the
legislative
history,
pointed
out
by
the
board
and
in
my
brief,
supports
that
position.
at
the
time
the
senate
and
the
house
conferees
were
attempting
to
resolve
the
difference
between
their
respective
bills,
senator
kennedy
introduced
to
and
had
placed
upon
the
calendar
of
the
senate
a
resolution
which
instructed
the
senate
conferees
to
insist
upon
the
inclusion
of
certain
provisions
in
the
conference
agreement.
included
in
the
provisions
dealing
with
the
amendments
to
8
(b)(4)
was
the
following
proviso,
“provided
that
nothing
contained
in
this
subsection
(b)
shall
be
construed
to
prohibit
publicity
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public,
including
consumers,
that
an
establishment
is
operated
or
goods
are
produced
or
distributed
by
an
employer
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute.
significantly,
this
language
was
not
adopted
by
the
congress,
though
senator
kennedy
himself
asked
it
to
be
in
the
senate
resolution
which
was
--
came
before
the
final
conference
committee
meeting
which
made
the
decision
as
to
what
the
lang--
which
language
shall
be
used.
this
cannot
be
dismissed,
as
the
board
would
urge.
this
legislative
history,
not
only
shows
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
exception
to
produce
as
a
product
which
are
distributed
by
another,
but
further
exemplifies
the
fact
that
congress
considered
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
words
"produced"
and
"distribute."
furthermore,
the
board
asked
the
court
to
read
the
statutory
language
as
though
it
contained
a
phrase
originally
presented
to
but
later
elimined--
eliminated
by
congress
in
the
cause
of
an
act.
this,
it
is
submitted,
the
--
this
court
has
often
said
it
cannot
do,
and
i
cite
the
board
of
pipeline
case
which
is
a
circuit
case
and
the
absence
to
picketing
case
on
page
17
in
footnote
of
my
brief.
a
further
analysis
of
the
language
of
8
(b)(4)
in
the
proviso
underscores
the
fact
that
the
limiting
language
of
the
proviso
was
intended
by
congress.
to
begin
with,
congress
not
only
limited
the
coverage
of
the
proviso
to
situations
with
a
labor
organization
has
a
dispute
which
producers
of
product
but
by
the
additional
language
in
the
proviso
that
these
products
are
distributed
by
another
employer.
it
is
obvious
that
congress
meant
that
the
product
must
be
capable
of
distribution.
the
services
of
servette
are
not
capable
of
distribution
unless
the
board
would
have
this
court,
not
only
broaden
the
term
"producer
of
products,"
but
ignore
the
qualifying
additional
language
in
regard
to
the
fact
that
product
should
be
capable
of
distribution.
at
the
very
least,
the
board's
unduly
broad
definition
of
the
term
"producer
of
products"
would
necessitate
that
the
additional
qualifying
phrase
"distributed
by
another
employer"
should
be
treated
as
surplusage.
thus,
it
is
submitted,
this
it
is
submitted,
would
be
improper.
moreover,
the
inconsistency
between
the
position
of
the
board
in
tree
--
in
the
tree
fruits
case
on
statutory
construction
and
the
position
it
takes
here
is
glaring.
in
its
argument,
to
show
that
congress
intended
its
secondary
boycott
activity
of
this
nature
constitutes
threat,
coercion,
and
restraint
with
the
meaning
of
8
(b)(4)(ii)
in
the
tree
fruits
case,
it
properly
note
that
a
subsequent
qualification
to
the
existing
proviso
shows
that
when
cong
--
that
congress,
when
it
was
intent
--
when
it
intended
to
condition
and
proscribe
against
secondary
activity
upon
proof
of
its
effect,
said
so
explicitly
and
cited
on
this
point
the
fact
that
congress
added
in
the
proviso
the
publicity
--
that
publicity
activity
will
not
be
permitted
if
it
has
the
effect
of
inducing
an
individual
employed
by
any
other
person
other
than
the
primary
employer
in
the
course
of
his
employment
to
refuse
to
pick
up,
deliver,
or
transport
any
goods,
or
not
to
perform
any
services.
we
certainly
agree
with
that
logic
but
say
it
should
be
carried
on
further.
surely,
by
the
same
reasoning,
it
follows
-
one,
that
within
the
very
same
proviso,
second
proviso,
congress
could
and
did
make
a
limitation
in
regard
to
producer
of
products
that
it
considered
proper
and
that
the
language
used
by
congress
expressing
the
further
limitation
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
inducement
fortifies
respondent's
position
that
producer
of
products
is
to
be
given
its
ordinary
commonsense
meaning.
for
both
in
the
proviso,
as
well
in
8
(b)(4),
congress
spelled
out
in
detail
the
proscription.
thus,
it
stated
in
8
(b)(4)(i)
that
inducing
an
individual
to
refuse
to,
and
you
can
follow
this
in
the
act,
"use,
manufacture,
process,
transport,
or
otherwise
handle
or
work
on
goods,
articles,
materials
or
commodities
or
to
perform
any
services,
was
violative
of
its
purpose."
well,
the
act,
if
its
purpose
was
to
force
or
require
any
person
to
cease
using,
selling,
handling,
transporting,
or
otherwise
dealing
in
the
products
of
any
producer,
processor,
or
manufacturer
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
person.
now,
this
is
all
in
the
act
and
statutory
language,
not
only
in
the
act
itself
but
in
the
proviso
itself.
surely,
therefore,
had
congress
desired
to
adopt
an
exception
as
broad
as
the
board
would
argue,
it
could
well
have
taken
language
from
the
statute
and
the
very
proviso
which
is
in
question.
it
could
have
easily
used
the
phraseology
of
something
like
this,
that
such
publicity
shall
not
be
prohibited
when
a
labor
organization
has
a
dispute
with
the
employer
who
uses,
handles,
transports,
or
otherwise
deals
in
products
of
any
producer,
processor,
or
manufacturer
or
otherwise
does
business
with
the
primary
employer.
this
is
the
very
language
which
this
board
is
now
urging
upon
us.
it
exists
in
the
statute.
it
exists
in
the
proviso,
but
when
we're
speaking
of
a
producer
of
products,
we
have
something
different.
thus,
congress
not
only
failed
to
adopt
existing
language
under
the
statute
and
the
proviso
which
would
accomplish
the
end
the
board
urges
but,
as
pointed
out
before,
specifically
refuse
to
adopt
broader
terminology
covering
respondent.
instead
it
chose
to
limit
its
terminology
and
its
scope.
if
this
court
extends
the
terminology
“producer
of
products”
as
it
exists
in
the
proviso,
it
would
be,
it
is
submitted,
differentially
expanding
congressional
intent.
it
is
submitted,
as
urged
before,
the
congressional
intent
has
been
made
quite
clear
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
by
its
legislative
history.
certainly,
congress
has
a
right
to
limit
the
scope
of
an
exception
and
congress
was
justified
in
doing
so
insofar
as
its
intent
was
a
proper
one,
one
admitted
by
the
board
to
restrict
the
spread
of
labor
disputes
throughout
the
community
and
to
limit
the
power
to
put
pressure
upon
neutral
parties
having
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
union's
grievances.
given
the
broad
interpretation
of
the
proviso
that
the
board
urges,
which
spread
the
conflict
far
beyond
the
concept
of
"following
an
annuity
of
product,"
this
doctrine
of
lec
--
limiting
secondary
boycotts
to
unfair
product
situations
has
been
advanced
and
improved
and
approved
of
in
at
least
one
supreme
court
opinion.
in
duplex
v.
deering,
justice
holmes'
dissent,
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
recognized
the
distinction
between
following
an
unfair
product
of
a
manufacturer,
with
whom
a
labor
organization
has
a
dispute,
and
secondary
boycott
activities
against
those
who
only
deal
in
the
product
or
in
some
lesser
fashion,
have
a
relationship
to
the
product.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
principal
case
the
board
seems
to
distinguish
auburn
draying,
cited
in
its
brief
on
pages
18
--
of
--
i
think
its
page
18,
was
cited
by
justice
holmes
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
duplex
to
support
the
position
he
took
there,
rather
than
aiding
the
boards
position.
it
submitted
that
this
case
undermines
it.
for,
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
similar
type
of
boycott
as
exists
in
the
present
instance.
their
truck
drivers
had
a
dispute
with
a
trucking
company
in
the
same
way
as
the
drivers
in
the
instant
case
had
a
dispute
with
servette.
in
auburn,
the
union
used
its
influence
on
customers,
or
potential
customers,
or
the
trucking
company
in
an
effort
to
have
these
neutral
employers
cease
doing
business
with
the
trucking
company.
the
situation
is
clearly
comparable
and
the
court,
in
the
auburn
case,
clearly
stated
that
this
constituted
coercion
which
was
unlawful.
it
is
submitted
that
that
case
is
directly
comparable
to
the
instant
one
and,
rather
than
supporting
the
board's
position,
it
undermines
it.
in
addition,
the
board
cites
other
cases
in
its
brief
purportedly
standing
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
proper
for
the
a
labor
union
to
follow
down
to
the
retail
level
products
which
are
handled
at
any
stage
of
manufacture
or
distribution
by
an
employer
with
whom
it
has
a
dispute.
the
goldfinger
case,
which
it
most
relies
upon,
does
not
support
that
proposition.
for,
there,
the
dispute
was
against
the
manufacturer
of
delicate
testing
products.
he
cured
them,
he
vindicated
them,
he
added
to
them,
he
was
a
manufacturer.
in
the
bossert
case,
cited
by
the
petitioner,
dispute
was
also
against
a
manufacturer,
in
that
case
the
case,
the
--
in
that
case,
non-union
manufactured
doors.
only
one
case
seemingly
supports
their
position
which
they
cite
and
that's
a
pennsylvania
case,
lyons
auto
case,
and
that
case
is
clearly
distinguishable.
there,
the
court
refused
under
pennsylvania
--
under
the
pennsylvania
anti-injunction
statute
to
enjoin
picketing
against
products
distributed
by
a
distributor
with
whom
the
union
had
a
dispute.
the
court
in
that
case,
however,
specifically
stated
and
emphasized
that,
"in
order
that
there'd
be
no
misconception
of
the
scope
of
this
decision,
one,
that
under
the
anti-injunction
acts,
acts
committed
can
be
enjoined
in
pennsylvania
whether
or
not
they
are
legal
or
illegal."
furthermore,
while
the
point
has
not
been
argued,
respondent
raised
it
--
did
raised
in
its
brief,
at
footnote
19
on
page
23,
the
fact
as
to
whether
the
proviso
applies
at
all
and
this
directs
itself
to
the
questions
of
justice
stewart
and
other
justices
who
have
spoken
out
here.
it
is
noted
that
the
handbilling
activities
in
the
locus
in
quo
in
front
of
the
stores
under
the
circumstances
of
an
admitted
boycott
of
dealers
which
had
all
the
meaningful
indicia
of
picketing
can
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
this
latter
type
of
picketing.
as
indicated
in
the
brief,
the
restatement
of
tort's
definition
of
picketing
includes
this
type
of
handbilling
in
locus
in
quo
for
the
purposes
sought.
other
cases
so
included.
and
this
court
in
the
boyd
and
gossom
case
indicated
that
the
essential
element
is
on
the
spot
holding
up
something
or
walking
something
but,
in
any
way,
on
the
spot
pressure.
and
that's
what
exists
in
the
handbilling
and
i'm
sure
this
court
would
not
clearly
make
a
distinction
between
that
which
is
on
a
stick
and
that
which
is
on
the
hand.
it
might
also
add
in
regard
to
the
montgomery
ward
case
which
the
solicitor
general
has
cited
that,
first
of
all,
the
case
specifically
said
it
was
relying
upon
the
statute,
the
war
labors
dispute
has
--
the
war
labors
act
statute
which
said
that
we
will
apply
the
fair
labor
standards'
provisions
and
definitions.
the
court
admittedly
did
go
on
and
decide
on
other
grounds
but,
in
and
so
looking
at
the
citing
on
the
grounds,
first,
it
said,
since
manufacturer
and
producer,
adjoined
together,
unless
we
give
a
broad
interpretation
to
the
word
"producer,"
it
will
all
be
covered
by
the
word
"manufacturer."
in
this
case,
in
this
proviso,
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
we
only
have
the
word
"producer."
thirdly,
the
board
--
the
court
--
circuit
court
in
montgomery
ward
stated
that
we
have
to
give
this
act
a
very
broad
interpretation
because
it
was
involved
under
the
war
situation
and
a
liberal
interpretation
was
called
for.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
was
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
submit,
justice
goldberg,
that
any
ordinary
employee,
still
in
that
position,
does
business
with
someone
else
and
refers
to
it,
in
a
colloquial
sense,
as
doing
business.
i
don't
believe
that
is
evidence
and,
certainly,
may
i
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
think
the
a
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
think
--
i
think
the
average
worker,
employee,
who
works
in
the
retail
agency,
who
works
with
sellers
and
buyers
constantly
is
maybe
a
supervisor
and
we
--
the
supervisor
would
be
included
but
that
does
not
make
him
the
type
of
individual
who
has
the
authority
to
decide
whether
we'll
buy
washington
apples
this
year
and
not
buy
on
this
year,
or
whether
we'll
serve
old
london
products.
i
don't
believe
that
does
it,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
well,
the
board
of
--
the
board,
in
urging
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
the
trial
examiner
didn't
support,
didn't
show
what
evidence
he
was
drawing
it
from
and
further,
the
detroit
evidence
--
detroit
edison
case
cited
on
page
--
on
footnote
11
of
my
brief
which
indicates
the
board
has
taken
the
position
in
an
analogous
situation
when--
under
8
(b)(4)(a)
when
someone
claimed
that
a
man
was
a
supervisor.
the
board
said
the
respondent,
meaning
the
union
on
this
instance,
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
presenting
evidence
showing
that
he
was
indeed
a
supervisor.
carrying
that
direct
logic
over
to
the
present,
your
honor,
it
would
say
that
if
the
respondent
states
that
such
and
such
an
individual
was
not
an
individual,
that
i
--
you'd
think
he
would
have
to
come
up
with
the
evidence
to
show
that.
and,
i
don't
believe
the
possible
inferences
that
are
being
drawn
here
now
support
the
overwhelming
facts
of
the
record
that
these
people
had
to
get
the
--
had
to
find
out
what
to
do
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
there
was
a
subsequent
meeting,
after
he
was
approached.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
well,
i'd
say
that,
your
honor,
that
all
the
solid
evidence,
not
inferences,
bearing
upon
this
case
and
to
exclude
them
with
the
burden
of
proof,
which
is
obviously
there
for
the
respondent
to
come
forward,
shows,
particularly
in
light
of
universal
camera,
that
there
is
just
not
enough
evidence
to
sustain
that
finding.
and,
the
evidence
would
go
the
other
way,
particularly
in
this
context,
when
we're
trying
to
determine
whether
an
individual
is
a
high
level,
colloquially,
or
a
low
level
or
has
the
specific
authority
to
do
the
--
to
make
these
decisions.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
it
does
now.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
yes,
and
that's
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
well,
who
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
don't
think
that
the
withholding
the
services
from
the
employer
is
a
necessary
thing.i
think
the
inducement
itself
is.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
as
a
solicitor
general,
there's
four.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
yes.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right,
that's
for
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
right.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
or
to
perform
services
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
--
or
handle
goods
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
--
or
sell.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
and,
that
is
exactly
what
these
particular
store
managers
did.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
believe
--
i
would
disagree
with
that
point
of
view.
i
would
say
that
the
language
is
clear
enough
and
the
fact
certain
employees,
used
in
its
broadest
context
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
--
would
not
do
specific
things
put
the
pressure
upon
both
the
primary
and
secondary
employer,
the
primary
employer
indirectly,
so
as
to
cause
the
end
which
congress,
i
--
i
suggest,
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
your
honor,
i
honestly
believe
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
sought
to
get
all
types
of
supervisors
now
within
the
phrase
“employees.”
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
upon
that
and
i
believe
that
because
these
sup
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
alright.
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
to
it
that
these
type
of
supervisors,
employees
--
a
supervisor
or
managerial
employees,
were
not
put
under
the
influence
of
a
union's
purpose
or
unlawful
objective.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
it
may
if
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
my
answer
to
that
would
be
two-folds,
justice
goldberg.
i
think
that
it
pose
an
interesting
question.
first
of
all,
it
may
not
be
considered
by
the
board
as
being
inducement,
particularly
directed
to
a
particular
employer,
a
group
of
employees
who
goes
over
television
to
the
public
generally,
so
i'm
not
certain
it
would
fall
into
that
category.
secondly,
is
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
in
that
instance,
yes,
it
might
well
be
inducement
and,
in
which
case,
it
might
well
be
unconstitutional,
one
of
the
two.
this
--
that
point
hasn't
been
raised
before.
i
would
suggest
that
if
he
specifically
went
over
the
television,
directed
his
attention
to
x-manager
or
xyz-managers
and
told
them
not
to,
i
would
suggest
that
would
probably
be
the
type
of
inducement
that
the
court
upheld
in
the
ibew
case.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
i
believe
--
i
believe,
justice
black,
that
that
type
of
inducement
would
be
violative
of
the
act
if
he
did
put
it
on
a
television
program
or
a
radio
program.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
constitutionally,
i
believe
--
i
believe
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
i
--
the
distinction
i
drew
was
a
general
appeal
to
the
public
in
general.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
if
it
did
include
the
man,
then
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
an
inducement.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
if
it
was
directed
to
particular
individuals,
i
believe
i
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
it
--
that
it
was
an
inducement
which
was
constitutionally
permitted
by
the
--
by
the
ibew
case,
as
i
--
as
i
read
it,
attached
upon
with
the
hughes
case
and
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
the
what
case,
your
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
thornhill.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
think
in
the
boyd
case,
the
court
clearly
went
through
all
the
cases
subsequent
to
thornhill
and
indicated
that,
particularly
under
a
secondary
boycott
provision,
it
would
not
be
violative
of
the
first
amendment
to
so
limit
inducement,
encouragement,
and
coercion,
and
so
forth.
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
not
fully
agree
with
that.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
think,
as
a
general
proposition
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
you're
correct,
justice
black.
but,
as
the
court
has
pointed
in
subsequent
decisions,
each
case
would
have
to
be
decided
in
the
particular
facts
itself
and
look
into
the
entire
integral
process
or
facts
surrounding
it.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
yes,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
resolve
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
--
the
question.
i
think
it
just
raises
it.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
it
just
possibly
raises
it.
i
don't
think
it's
raised
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
by
the
amici
brief
which,
as
i
indicated
before,
a
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
it
was
raised
in
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
yes,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that,
again,
that
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court
and
this
court
frowns
upon
amicus
raising
new
issues,
particularly
constitutional
issues,
but,
certainly,
it
has
not
been
raised
in
the
lower
courts
or
by
--
in
front
of
the
board
in
this
particular
matter.
however,
i
realize
that
--
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
i
believe
so,
justice
black,
to
be
candid.
now,
i
only
have
a
few
more
minutes.
i'd
like
to
just
touch
upon
two
other
issues.
one
is,
i
think,
there's
an
additional
reason
for
the
unfair
labor
practice
finding
or
should
be,
is
that
the
proviso
should
be
read
very
closely.
in
the
proviso,
it
says,
in
effect,
that
if
the
union's
actions,
as
a
publicity,
has
the
effect
of
making
any
individual
refuse
to
perform
services,
the
proviso
does
not
apply.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
these
particular
store
managers
are
individuals
under
the
act,
i
submit,
and
they
did
refuse
to
perform
their
services
of
selling,
handling,
and
all
the
rest
of
these
particular
products.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
no,
justice
goldberg.
i
don't
believe
that
necessarily
follows
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
in
the
first
instance,
you
had
--
you
had
the
union
agents
going
to
these
supervisors
and
asking
them
not
to
do
such
and
such.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
and
they
didn't
make
the
decision.
mr.
stanley
e.
tobin
they
didn't
make
a
decision.
what
they
did
--
they
did
make
a
decision
for
the
employer.
they
did
an
act
which
does
not
necessarily
equate
with
the
decision
for
the
employer.
it
may
not
be
the
same
if
an
employee
decides
to
do
something
on
his
own.
that
doesn't
mean
he
had
the
authority
or
right
or
he
was
--
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
to
so
do
it.
it
means
that--
it
probably
means,
justice
goldberg,
that
he
was
a
union
adherent
and
he
said
“to
heck
with
the
boss.”
i
believe
that
based
upon
that
concept,
the
individuals
who
failed
to
perform
their
services
were
these
store
managers
and,
therefore,
their
actions
remove
the
protection
that
might
conceivably
otherwise
be
given
to
the
union's
activity.
there's
a
final
point.
there
is
a
fervent
provision
within
the
proviso
and
that
said
and
states
that
any
publicity
must
be
truthful.
now,
in
this
case,
the
union
signs
--
i
mean,
the
union's
handbills
say
--
stated
that
old
london
products,
rocks
candy,
etcetera
were
products
distributed
to
this
store
by
servette.
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
only
some
of
these
products
were
distributed
by
servette
to
some
of
the
stores,
that
some
of
these
products
were
distributed
to
some
of
these
stores
by
another
distributor,
certified
grocers
of
california.
now,
the
board
says,
in
saying
this
is
still
truthful,
says
you
don't
have
to
be
100%
truthful.
but,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
who
is
being
hurt
by
this?
this
other
distributor,
certified
grocers,
who
i'm
sure
congress
was
also
trying
to
protect,
having
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
dispute,
was
having
its
products
not
bought
or
sold
because
of
these
signs.
secondly,
a
manufacturer,
who
might
not
even
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
servette,
was
having
his
products
not
bought
or
sold
because
of
the
union's
activity.
any
individual
store,
a
particular
store
was
being,
in
effect,
literally
picketed
or
boycotted,
having
products
of
it
not
sold
because
of
the
union's
activity.
i
submit
that
the
truthful
qualification
that
exists
in
the
proviso
certainly
has
not
been
met
in
this
case,
and
that
every
person
possible
that
congress
sought
to
protect
was
harmed
and,
therefore,
the
proviso
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
