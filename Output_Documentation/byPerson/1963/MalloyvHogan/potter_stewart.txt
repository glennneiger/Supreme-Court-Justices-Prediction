you
mean
the
underlying
the
investigation
by
judge
inglis.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
grand
jury.
i
thought
it
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
judge
inglis.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
grand
jury,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
was
the
equivalent,
but
there
wasn't
a
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
a
statute.

54-47,
which
appears
on
page
a4
of
the
appendix
to
the
--
of
page
three,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
remaining
amendments?
justice
potter
stewart
what
remaining
amendments
there
have
been
now
what
23,
24
amendments.
justice
potter
stewart
first
eight
eh.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
eight
amendments?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
to
that,
i
would
--
i
just
reread
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of,
where
was
it,
connecticut,
justice
king's
opinion,
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
he
cites
good
many
more
federal
cases
and
he
does
state
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
he
cites
the
hoffman
case
four,
five
times,
that's
the
one
you're
relying
on.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
seems
to
equate
the
privilege
that
you've
guaranteed
under
the
connecticut
constitution
to
the
privilege
which
is
guaranteed
under
federal
constitution,
he
seems
to
be
applying
a
federal
test
all
the
way
through
here.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
incorrectly
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
really
see,
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
--
this
big
question
to
which
you
are
addressing
yourself
is
before
us
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
he
cites
cases
in
this
court
and
cases
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeal,
all
the
way
through
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
and
text
be
questioned
which
this
witness
refused
to
answer,
under
those
federal
tests
all
the
way
through
the
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
don't
quarrel
that,
do
you?
do
you
quarrel
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
fifth
amendment
applies
to
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
read
the
next
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
different
reason;
that's
an
entirely
different
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
your
supreme
court
of
errors
is
required
to
do
so,
don't
you
read
their
opinion
as
having
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
having
--
having
tried
to
follow
federal
standards?
i've
just
counted
it
up
and
they
cited
the
hoffman
case
in
that
opinion
more
often
than
any
other
single
case.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
you'd
follow
it
at
least
they
seem
to
be
feel
--
bound
by
those
precedents
or
at
least
divided
by
them.
