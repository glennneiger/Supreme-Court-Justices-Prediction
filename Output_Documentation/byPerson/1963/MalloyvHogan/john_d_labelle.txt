mr.
john
d.
labelle
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
facts
for
just
a
moment
before
we
get
on
with
some
of
these
other
issues.
chief
justice,
former
chief
justice
inglis,
was
appointed
what
we
call
a
one
man
grand
jury
for
purposes
of
conducting
this
investigation.
that's
under
the
statute
54-47.
he
is
an
experienced
judge,
trial
judge
for
many
years,
a
former
chief
justice
who
had
just
been
retired
and
was
then
state
referee,
a
man
of
extreme
and
very
wide
experience.
this
investigation
with
respect
to
this
case
involved
a
booking
operation.
when
the
petitioner
was
arrested
along
with
two
others,
they
were
in
an
apartment
house
in
hartford
operating
what
is
known
in
the
bookie
business
as
an
office.
and
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
booking
operation
in
the
office,
and
in
this
office
they
keep
the
records.
they
have
to
have
a
writer.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
this
instance
malloy
was
one
of
the
writers
along
with
the
two
others.
they
were
simply
employees
of
this
bookie
operations.
that's
the
extent
of
their
involvement.
and
when
they
were
arrested
all
of
the
records
of
the
office
were
there.
he
was
convicted,
malloy
was,
and
after
his
conviction
and
after
the
statute
of
limitations
of
one
year
had
run,
he
was
called
before
this
grant
jury
and
asked
these
questions.
now
malloy
had
no
prior
criminal
record
of
any
extent,
one
or
two
misdemeanor
charges
involving
motor
vehicles
and
one
or
two
involving
intoxication.
other
than
that,
no
record.
he
was
an
old
racketeer,
he
wasn't
a
gambler
in
the
sense
that
he
was
the
object
of
this
investigation.
he
wasn't
known
as
a
racketeer
or
had
a
reputation
as
such.
he
was
simply
an
employee
of
this
operation
that
was
running
the
booking
game.
now
when
he
got
before
this
judge
inglis,
he
refused
to
answer
the
questions
put
in
the
record.
now
when
he
asserted
his
privilege,
the
first
thing
that
he
did
here
was
not
tell
judge
inglis,
why
he
thought
he
would
be
incriminated.
and
to
this
day,
there
has
not
been
any
indication
of
what
fear
of
incrimination
he
had.
there
has
been
vague
talk
here
about
conspiracies
or
conspiracy
to
commit
some
felony,
but
not
once
either
in
this
court
or
in
the
lower
court
or
in
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
and
in
argument
this
morning
has
anyone
said
what
crimes
he
was
concerned
about
incriminating
himself
with.
now
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
counsel
at
least
or
somebody
should
have
informed
the
court
in
some
manner
and
if
they
worrying
about
a
link
in
the
chain
of
circumstances
counsel
could
have
done
it.
they
could
have
told
judge
inglis
or
had
his
man
tell
judge
inglis
and
the
grand
jury,
or
he
himself
in
the
court
when
the
contempt
was
brought
had
notified
the
court
what
crime
that
they
were
concerned
about
or
given
the
court
some
inkling
of
why
he
had
some
fear
of
incrimination.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
would
had
to
do
the
same
thing
under
the
hoffman
rule,
of
course
he
would,
of
course
he
would.
there
isn't
any
court
that's
held
yet
that
i
know
of,
that
says
that
he
can
simply
say,
i
will
not
answer
because
i
fear
incrimination
and
that's
it.
that's
what's
happened
here.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
rule
that
i
know
of
been
annunciated
that
says
that
he
doesn't
have
to
give
the
court
at
least
some
inkling.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
some
years
ago,
he
must
given
him
at
least
a
sense.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
the
word
was
good
though
[laughing
attempt].
he
must
at
least
give
the
court
some
sense
of
what
he
fears.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
factually.
now
the
questions
are
not
questions
that
we're
trying
to
snare
this
man,
it's
obvious
from
the
questions
that
we
were
trying
to
find
out,
who
ran
this
booking
operation
and
who
was
the
one
behind
this
office.
who
was
he
working
for,
whom
he
was
working
for?
now
malloy
was
not
anyone
that
we
needed
or
wanted
or
had
any
reason
to
try
to
snare
him
and
his
record
doesn't
indicate
any
such
thing.
so
that
he
simply,
after
he
has
--
his
incrimination
had
been
expurgated
by
conviction,
by
the
statute
of
limitations
running,
said
i'm
going
to
answer.
and
the
first
time
he
went
into
the
grant
jury,
by
the
way
he
didn't
answer
anything,
he
didn't
answer
any
questions.
then
judge
inglis,
in
his
wisdom,
said
you
go
out
and
discuss
this
with
counsel
and
he
continued
the
case
for
ten
days,
and
he
came
back
in
the
second
time
and
he
did
answer
a
couple
of
questions,
but
other
than
that
he
took
the
same
position
with
respect
to
these
basic
questions
that
were
presented
the
second
time.
now
counsel
had
suggested
that
this
court
apply
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states
in
all
its
suite,
and
i
don't
concede
that
that
is
the
issue.
in
our
brief,
we
have
said
that
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
make
us
realize
that
no
state
is
free
to
compel
incrimination
under
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
40
--
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it's
said
in
your
confession
cases,
it's
said
in
i
think
all
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
they
are
fourteenth
amendment
cases
and
we're
talking
about
fourteenth
amendment
today,
i
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
states
not
to
incriminate.
that
doesn't
mean
necessarily
that
the
court
has
to
incorporate
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
due
process,
as
required
by
the
states,
means
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
state
cannot
do
any
longer,
if
they
ever
could,
is
compel
a
witness
to
criminate
himself.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
either
accept
the
--
well
in
rogers
and
richmond
case
for
example
where
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
correct
i
think
that
the
coerced
confession
cases
are
fourteenth
amendment
cases
where
the
court
has
been
involved
in
a
fiction.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i'm
not
saying
your
honor
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
the
states.
i
am
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
states
not
to
incriminate
witnesses.
and
i
say
that
because
all
of
us,
48
states
have
got
constitutional
provisions
with
respect
to
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
also,
with
respect
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
my
position
is
that
that's
procedural
due
process
which
this
court
can
look
at.
i
don't
claim
that
this
court
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction
here
to
look
at
this
question.
i
think
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
has
the
right
to
examine
what
we
did,
with
respect
to
incrimination
and
to
see
whether
or
not
due
process
was
given.
now
that
is
the
position
i
take,
and
i
think
that
basically
due
process
prohibits
states
to
compel
a
witness
to
criminate
himself.
now
we
have
applied
all
of
those
requirements
of
due
process
in
this
case,
every
one
of
them.
we've
followed
even,
if
you
will,
the
federal
standards
as
set
froth
in
hoffman,
but
we're
not
required
to
do
that
as
long
as
we
have
pro--
as
long
as
we
have
complied
with
what
is
i
can
consider
or
what
has
been
called
procedural
due
process
that
is
due
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
states
are
charged
with
in
and
off
itself.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
certainly
do
and
our
brief
certainly
covers
that.
i
think
that
we
did
follow
the
hoffman
rule.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
judge
king
in
the
reference
your
honor
made
to
the
last
page
of
the
opinion,
the
last
paragraph
i
believe
it
is
where
he
said
that
the
question
could
be
looked
at
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
a
fair
trial.
again,
procedural
due
process,
and
in
this
case
our
court
did
follow
this
procedural
due
process.
now
i
don't
say
that
this
is
an
incorporation
of
the
fifth
amendment
into
the
fourteenth.
you
start
off
with
the
states
being
bound
by
the
fourteenth
to
give
due
process
in
criminal
proceedings,
and
in
this
instance,
the
state
has
done
just
that.
i
see
no
basis
for
the
claim
that
whatever
standard
has
to
be
applied
that
the
standard
that
this
connecticut
court
applied
was
any
different
or
lesser
than
the
standards
that
federal
court
would
have
applied
under
the
hoffman
rule.
i
think
that
we
have
complied
with
that,
take
it
that.
i
would
have
the
rest
of
my
time
after
the
luncheon
recess.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
all
right.
the
petitioner
has
suggested
that
all
of
this
court's
many
cases
be
overruled
because
the
fifth
amendment
automatically
applies
to
the
states,
i
of
course
do
not
agree
with
that
whatsoever,
and
i
see
no
reason
in
this
case
for
instance
to
have
anything
to
do
with
twining
and
new
jersey
or
the
adamson
case.
the
only
thing
that
in
those
cases
that
this
court
might
need
to
consider
at
all
is
some
of
the
sweeping
language
which
seems
say
that
a
state
can
compel
incrimination.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
overruling
them,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this,
whether
or
not
the
fifth
amendment
is
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth.
insofar
states
are
concerned,
the
only
thing
that's
in
there
that
could
be
question
whatsoever
and
that
--
by
any
structure,
the
imagination
might
need
clarifying
is
the
question
of
this
broad
language
that
a
state
might
compel
incrimination.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
so
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
there
is
no
reason
to
overrule
any
of
those
decisions.
now
with
respect
to
adamson
and
twining,
for
example,
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
issues
raised
in
those
cases
were
issues
--
never
had
to
decide
those
issues
because
it
isn't
--
the
question
has
never
come
up.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
was
raised
earlier
as
to
what
kind
of
a
contempt
this
was,
and
i
meant
to
say
that
in
my
initial
remarks
about
the
facts
that
this
was
a
civil
contempt.
they
are
held
as
a
civil
prisoner
and,
as
your
honor
has
remarked,
they
hold
the
key
to
getting
out,
so
that
it
is
not
a
criminal
contempt.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
he
brought
a
habeas
corpus
action
here,
you
see
what
happened
was
the
judge
inglis,
the
investigating
grand
juror,
didn't
have
any
right
to
hold
him
in
contempt.
it
required
the
state's
attorney
to
bring
a
proceeding
in
the
superior
court,
a
complaint
asking
that
he'd
be
held
in
contempt.
he
then
was
brought
into
the
superior
court
where
a
hearing
was
held
on
these
questions.
then
he
was
held
in
contempt,
put
in
jail,
and
he
brought
a
habeas
corpus
that
afternoon.
then
on
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
on
the
civil
side
of
the
court,
the
same
question
was
gone
over
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
being
properly
held
as
a
civil
prisoner.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
habeas
corpus
is
still
a
proceeding
in
our
state.
it's
handled
on
the
civil
side
of
the
court.
the
presentment
by
the
state's
attorney
for
failure
to
answer
the
questions
was
a
proceeding
in
the
criminal
side
of
the
superior
court,
who
was
the
superior
--
criminal
side
is
the
one
who
appointed
chief,
ex
chief
justice
inglis
as
the
grand
juror.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
from
the
habeas
corpus,
that's
correct.
so
it
comes
up
under
the
civil
side.
but
again
in
the
habeas
corpus
and
in
the
contempt
proceedings
themselves
the
same
questions
were
gone
into
so
that
he
had
an
opportunity
here
before
judge
inglis
to
state
why
he
was
--
what
his
fear
of
incrimination
was.
he
had
the
opportunity
before
the
criminal
side
of
the
court
on
the
complaint
for
contempt,
and
he
had
the
opportunity
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
and
yet
to
this
day
we
haven't
found
out
what
he
was
fearing.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
instance
it
is
not
a
question
here
as
to
the
nature
of
a
state
being
free
to
compel
incrimination
that
is.
i
think
all
of
the
states
must
abide
by
their
own
constitutional
requirements
and
with
respect
to
self-incrimination.
the
question
here
is
the
dimension
of
that
privilege.
that
is
what
is
involved
here.
and
so
far
as
states
are
concerned
that
dimension
only
applies
to
their
own
jurisdiction.
in
the
next
case
that's
going
to
follow,
that
issue
will
be
expanded
because
you
get
into
the
question
of
the
immunity
that's
granted
in
these
different
states.
i
might
say
right
here
that
in
connecticut
we
haven't
any
general
immunity
statute.
we
have
some
immunity
statutes
that
apply
to
some
administrative
agencies
but
insofar
as
the
criminal
side
the
court
is
concerned,
we
don't
have
a
general
immunity
statute.
therefore
the
test
that
our
court
applied
here
with
respect
to
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
to
tell
the
court
something
about
his
fear
is
certainly
understandable,
because
we
haven't
any
way
of
getting
any
place
in
connecticut
in
an
investigating
nature,
if
all
he
can
do
is
say
i
assert
my
privilege
and
that's
it.
now
that's
conceivable
--
it
is
conceivable
for
instance
in
another
state
where
the
immunity
is
granted
and
granted
freely,
all
they
have
to
do
is
if
he
asserts
his
privilege
to
grant
him
the
immunity,
then
i
--
how
they
do
it
in
these
other
states
i'm
not
certain,
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
not
concerned
so
much
with
any
explanation
under
those
circumstances
as
we
might
be
in
connecticut.
but
in
connecticut
at
least
we
ought
to
be
told
certainly
by
argument
at
least
of
counsel
because
that
doesn't
incriminate
anyone,
what
the
fear
is
and
what
crimes
that
he
is
worried
about
being
prosecuted
for.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
doesn't
have
to
tell
what
the
offence
is,
but
i
think
that
there
is
some
burden
here
on
the
petitioner
to
say
to
the
court,
i
fear
incrimination
because
and
give
us
something
that,
well,
the
court
in
its
judgment
and
its
wisdom
can
apply.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
he
should
not
of
course
not,
but
he
cannot
remain
silent
and
simply
say,
i
assert
the
privilege.
it
requires
more
than
that,
and
in
this
instance
nothing
has
been
done
about
that
except
to
say,
i
fear
incrimination
and
i
refuse
to
answer.
and
in
this
case
he
refused
to
answer
all
questions
the
first
time
he
was
there,
and
then
the
ones
he
did
answer
were
very
innocuous
questions
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
investigation
particularly.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no
your
honor,
our
conspiracy
statute
requires
us
--
of
course,
you
have
to
conspire
to
do
something,
and
in
this
conspiracy,
his
conspiracy
would
have
been
pool
selling
conspiracy,
at
least
that's
all
we
can
find
from
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well,
if
it
was
any
other
conspiracy
certainly
some
inclination
ought
to
have
been
given,
but
under
the
studying
of
the
case
all
of
the
facts
before
the
court,
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
any
involvement
in
anything
other
than
this
pool
selling
employment.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
under
those
circumstances
if
your
honor
please,
and
this
is
one
of
the
questions
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
raised
that
he
made
the
argument
and
has
made
it
of
this
date
conspiracy
that
he
was
concerned
with,
but
this
--
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
all
of
the
facts
before
the
court,
this
man
was
not
involved
in
anything
only
pool
selling.
now
if
the
conspiracy
was
to
violate
the
pool
selling
statute,
that
--
statute
of
limitations
for
that
conspiracy
is
a
misdemeanor
also.
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
anyplace
to
give
the
court
any
inkling
that
this
conspiracy
he
has
been
talking
about
is
any
conspiracy
other
than
involves
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
pool
selling
statute
and
that
is
a
misdemeanor
under
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
correct.
i
recognize
that
in
that
type
of
an
investigation
that
there
is
more
leeway
that
has
to
be
given
to
a
witness.
insofar
as
this
witness
was
concerned,
he
was
not
interrogated
about
anything
other
than
this
one
pool
selling
operation.
in
other
words
this
--
the
mandate
to
the
grand
juror
to
investigate
crime
covered
a
lot
of
areas,
but
with
respect
to
this
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
he
was
only
questioned
and
only
involved
in
this
one
pool
selling
matter.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
have
a
waiver
doctrine
and
i
would
say
that
our
doctrine
of
waiver
isn't
one
that
that
you
can
insert
at
anytime
that
you
want.
if
you
open
the
door,
then
you
are
subject
to
answering
the
questions.
in
this
instance,
the
waiver
never
came
into
effect
and
he
--
again,
if
he
had
ever
told
the
court
what
he
feared,
any
inkling
of
it,
the
court
would
have
certainly
taken
that
into
consideration
under
the
circumstances.
but
here
was
a
man
who
had
absolutely
no
background
of
any
criminality
whatsoever.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
other
than
this
one
instance
that
we
were
questioning
him
about.
in
other
words
he
hadn't
had
any
prior
pool
selling
record,
he
didn't
have
any
prior
felony
convictions,
he
was
not
known
to
be
involved
in
any
syndicate
or
any
operation
of
a
bookie
nature
other
than
this
one
for
which
he
had
just
been
convicted.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
was
on
probation
at
that
time
and
had
been
convicted,
it
was
a
little
over
a
year,
he
had
served
his
sentence.
but
we
never
went
outside
that
one
conviction
and
the
questions
were
limited
to
the
day
that
was
arrested.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
because
we
were
looking
to
see
who
he
was
employed
--
whom
he
was
employed
by.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
might
have
been,
but
again
for
information
purposes,
we
might
have
been
glad
to
know
it.
well
they
may
have
still
been
in
operation
too.
we
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
was
on
probation
at
the
time.
presumably
not
involved
in
any
other
illegal
activities.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
i
don't
claim
that.
this
question
was
asked
about
the
single
day
of
his
arrest.
that's,
on
the
day
of
his
arrest
for
whom
was
he
working.
that's
what
we
wanted
to
know.
and
here
he
was
using
his
privilege
to
protect
a
third
party.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
they
all
had
to
do
with
the
same
arrest,
the
same
day,
and
i
happen
to
be
the
one
asking
the
questions
and
i
tried
to
hold
him
to
the
same
day
for
which
he
had
been
arrested.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
it's
in
the
record
on
page
20.
i
ask
you
again
mr.
malloy
now,
so
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding
of
what
i
want
to
know,
when
you
were
arrested
on
september
11,
1959
at
600,
asylum
street
in
hartford,
and
the
same
arrest
for
which
you
were
convicted
in
superior
court
on
november
5,
1959
for
whom
were
you
working.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
think
so
specifically
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
would
say
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
would
say
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
i
only
asked
him
about
a
half
a
dozen,
i
wasn't
getting
any
place.
i
asked
him
all
--
there
are
perhaps
10
or
12
questions
here
and
the
second
time
he
answered
one
or
two.
for
instance,
i
asked
him
while
he
was
serving
his
sentence
in
jail
did
he
continue
to
receive
his
salary
or
get
paid
by
his
employer.
he
said
no,
and
i
asked
him
if
his
family
had
received
any
help
from
his
employer
or
anyone
while
he
was
in
jail.
this
is
on
his
sentence
now
for
the
pool
selling
conviction
we
were
talking
about,
and
he
said
no
to
that.
but
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no
i
never
claimed
that.
that
isn't
in
this
case.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
i
never
claim
that
in
this
case
and
i
don't
know;
it
isn't
in
the
case,
the
waiver
is
not
in.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
asked
these
questions
that
are
set
forth
in
the
record.
this
is
all
--
by
the
way
this
is
all
of
the
testimony
with
respect
to
this
witness,
it's
all
right
here.
there
wasn't
any
other
and
everything
is
right
there.
this
is
the
complete
transcript
of
what
went
on
when
he
was
in
the
--
before
judge
inglis
both
times.
so
that
we
weren't
away
from
this
particular
one
issue,
we
stayed
right
on
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no
i
do
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that
was
simply
your
honor
to
show
that
in
the
setting
which
judge
inglis
was
hearing,
this
man
was
not
a
man
that
there
was
any
publicity
about
of
being
in
the
rackets
or
being
a
gambler,
there
was
no
information
before
the
court
or
the
grand
jury
that
this
man
was
involved
in
anything
other
than
his
employment
as
a
writer
in
the
office.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
i
don't
care
to
put
it
in
quite
that
--
from
that
point
of
view,
but
i
think
it's
a
fact
that
the
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it's
a
circumstance
that
the
court
can
take
into
consideration
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
a
man
has
any
less
privilege
because
he
has
been
a
good
citizen.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no
i
simply
--
my
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
just
wanted
to
say
to
the
court
that
it
appears
from
this
record
that
this
man
was
refusing
to
answer
because
he
was
trying
to
protect
third
parties,
and
that
is
not
a
matter
that
the
privilege
can
be
used
for.
