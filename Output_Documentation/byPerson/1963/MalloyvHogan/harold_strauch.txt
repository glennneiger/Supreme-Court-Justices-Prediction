mr.
harold
strauch
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harold
strauch
you
think
of
grouch,
it's
easy
strauch.
mr.
harold
strauch
this
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
i
believe
is
an
uncomplicated
case,
which
modestly
requests
of
this
court
a
ruling
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
the
individual
states.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
the
case,
which
are
very
brief,
should
be
annunciated.
in
september
of
1959,
in
the
state
and
local
police
officials
in
concert
conducted
a
raid
throughout
the
hartford
county
community
and
caught
a
number
of
individuals
including
the
petitioner
and
two
others.
incidentally,
the
case
that
will
be
decided
here,
the
decision
of
this
court
will
be
binding
upon
the
other
two
as
well
as
on
the
particular
petitioner
that's
mentioned
in
this
case.
these
three
gentlemen
were
caught
in
an
apartment,
in
one
of
the
large
apartment
houses
in
hartford,
where
presumably
they
were
manning
telephones,
collecting
bets
and
relaying
the
bets
to
a
central
source.
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
pool
selling.
mr.
harold
strauch
pool
selling
it's
what
is
known
as
--
mr.
harold
strauch
pool
selling,
it's
a
misdemeanor,
it's
a
gambling.
it's
booking.
he
was
--
the
petitioner
was
found
guilty
of
pool
selling,
which
is
a
misdemeanor
in
connecticut,
given
a
one
year
sentence
in
the
county
jail,
which
was
audit
suspended
after
90
days
but
then
he
was
put
on
probation
for
a
period
of
two
years.
subsequently,
in
january
of
1961,
a
special
--
the
equivalent
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
was
brought
about
and
the
former
chief
justice
of
state
of
connecticut
was
the
grand
juror.
and
the
--
these
three
people
were
called
before
the
grand
jury
and
malloy,
in
particular,
was
asked
a
series
of
six
questions,
which
he
refused
to
answer,
basing
his
refusal
upon
the
fifth
amendment
as
supplemented
by
the
fourteenth.
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
the
petitioner
were
as
follows
for
whom
he
worked
on
september
11,
1959,
which
happened
to
be
the
day
of
the
raid?
who
selected
and
paid
his
counsel
in
connection
with
his
arrest
on
september
11,
1959
and
paid
for
his
subsequent
appearances
in
court
due
to
that
arrest?
who
selected
and
paid
his
bondsman,
who
paid
his
fine,
the
name
of
the
tenant
of
the
apartment
in
which
he
was
arrested,
and
whether
or
not
he
knew
one
john
bergoti?
as
a
result
of
his
refusal
to
answer
these
questions,
he
was
found
guilty
of
contempt,
which
was
confirmed
by
our
supreme
court
of
errors,
and
as
a
result
of
that
we
are
before
this
court.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
would
think
it's
criminal
contempt
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
he
was
fined
--
he
was
sent
to
the
county
jail
until
he
purges
himself
of
his
contempt
or
until
the
court
releases
him.
in
other
words,
the
threat
that
was
over
him
was
that
he
remains
incarcerated
until
he
releases
himself
from
prison
by
confessing
or
answering
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
him
and
that
could
possibly
incriminate
him.
mr.
harold
strauch
no,
he
is
out
on
bail.
a
habeas
corpus
action
was
brought
and
he
was
out
--
and
he
is
out
on
bail.
mr.
harold
strauch
no
there
was
no
fine
sir.
well
--
mr.
harold
strauch
that
would
be
by
interpretation
of
it
under
what
i
think
is
the
jackson
case
that
we
have
in
connecticut.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
maybe
wrong
about
that,
but
in
any
event
this
sort
of
action
is
considered
a
criminal
proceeding.
cases
have
held
--
cases
have
held
that
--
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right.
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right.
mr.
harold
strauch
oh,
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
--
let
me
see,
i'd
like
to
get
that
specifically.
it
was
to
investigate
--
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
was
to
investigate
crimes
in
hartford
county
including
gambling
activities.
so
that
--
mr.
harold
strauch
well,
it
was
a
special
investigation.
mr.
harold
strauch
judge
inglis
sat
as
a
special
investigator
in
a
grand
jury
atmosphere.
mr.
harold
strauch
other
than
he
was
the
equivalent
of
a
grand
jury
in
my
opinion
because
--
mr.
harold
strauch
no,
no
but
he
was
acting
as
the
equivalent
of
a
grand
jury.
counsel
was
not
permitted
to
be
there.
only
the
state's
attorney,
the
stenographer,
and
the
witnesses
as
they
were
called
in,
one
at
a
time.
mr.
harold
strauch
he
was
appointed
i
believe
by
the
courts.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes,
i
believe
that
was
true,
under
a
statute
--
under
a
statute,
which
permits
that
to
be
done.
mr.
harold
strauch
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
harold
strauch
he
filed
it
with
the
superior
court,
which
has
jurisdiction
of
this
sort
of
matter.
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
information.
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
right,
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
a
state
statute.
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right.
mr.
harold
strauch
absolutely,
that's
right.
i
think
that
a
reasonable
point
to
start
this
case
is
to
go
back
to
that
famous
case
of
barron
versus
baltimore,
where
chief
justice
marshall
held
for
the
first
time
that
the
parastate
amendments
apply
to
the
federal
courts
only.
of
course
thereafter
in
1866
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
applied
or
was
adopted,
we
believe
a
different
situation
was
created.
and
as
a
result
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
series
of
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
taken
over
or
incorporated
as
part
of
the
fundamental
law
of
the
land.
and
those
amendments
were
the
first
amendment,
the
holding
of
free
speech,
freedom
of
religion
and
so
forth;
the
sixteenth
amendment
giving
the
accused
the
right
to
counsel
in
powell
as
decided
in
powell
versus
alabama
and
recently
in
gideon
versus
wainwright;
the
eighth
amendment,
relating
to
the
banning
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
as
set
forth
in
the
robinson
and
california
case,
also
a
portion
of
the
fifth
amendment
relating
to
the
taking
of
property
for
public
purposes
without
just
compensation,
as
set
forth
in
the
chicago,
baltimore
&
q.
railroad
versus
the
city
of
chicago
case.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right.
mr.
harold
strauch
yeah.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes.
under
the
--
first
of
all
we
deny
that
at
least
that
the
petitioner
had
limited
himself
only
to
the
commission
of
misdemeanors
for
which
there
was
only
a
one
year
statute
of
limitations
and
which
statute
had
told
by
the
time
that
judge
inglis
(ph)
had
entered
the
picture.
secondly,
we
assert
that
he
could
have
been
readily
involved
in
a
series
of
felonies
for
which
there
is
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
he
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
commit
felonies,
there
is
a
15-year
statute
of
limitations.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
court
erred,
our
state
court
erred,
when
it
said
that
he
could
not
possibly
incriminate
himself
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
intervened.
it
hadn't
in
our
judgment.
further
that
this
being
a
constitutional
question
that
if
the
fifth
--
sort
of
the
fourteenth
is
held
to
apply
so
that
our
court
--
so
that
the
state
court
had
to
conform
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth,
then
the
standard
of
constitutionality
had
to
be
the
federal
standards,
as
set
forth
in
the
ker
case
and
also
perhaps
in
the
fahy
versus
connecticut
case,
which
was
heard
last
december
it's
the
federal
standards
when
you
reach
a
constitutional
question
that
apply
and
those
federal
standards
as
they
are
demonstrated
through
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
connecticut,
the
court
used
a
standard
that
the
judge
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
questions
were
harmful
could
exercise
reasonable
judgment
and
that
--
and
he
had
to
act
as
a
reasonable
person
and
reasonably
conclude
that
the
questions
would
be
damaging
to
the
witness.
whereas
in
the
federal
cases
such
as
in
the
hoffman
case,
the
singleton
case,
the
iupa
case
and
mathy
case
and
so
forth,
it's
held
that
the
standard
that
must
be
used
is
not
the
heavy
strong
standard
of
reasonableness,
as
whether
or
not
in
the
context
of
the
situation
the
width
that
can
be
concluded
that
the
witness
would
incriminate
himself
by
his
testimony.
there
is
a
substantially
lesser
standard
that
was
to
demonstrated
that
i
think
is
early
as
in
the
burt
trials.
when
chief
justice
marshall
said
in
effect
that
if
the
witness
testifies,
swears
under
oath,
that
the
questions
are
incriminating,
that
is
enough.
and
it's
also
in
cases
--
in
the
hoffman
case.
it
says
that
if
the
witness
is
to
try
to
explain
why
the
questions
will
be
damaging
to
him,
he
is
exposing
himself
to
the
hazard
that
he
is
seeking
to
avoid,
and
that
has
been
repeated,
i
think
even
in
the
mathy
case,
which
i
think
said
that
even
the
mere
possibility
that
the
questions,
the
answers
to
the
questions
will
be
incriminating,
is
sufficient
to
permit
the
witness
the
immunity
of
silence.
there
is
also
of
course,
which
i
hadn't
mentioned
up
to
this
point,
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
to
the
states
through
the
wolf
case,
and
mapp
case
and
the
ker
case.
this
is
a
case
upon
which,
to
be
perfectly
candid,
we
hope
the
premise
our
hope
for
a
reversal
of
what
is
the
common
practice
of
the
(inaudible)
with
reference
to
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states.
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
various
aspects
of
the
bill
of
rights
do
become
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
various
formulas
were
devised
and
cited
saying
that
the
constitutional
question
that
--
amendment
that
is
in
question
applies
to
the
states
if
it
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
if
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
a
scheme
of
ordered
liberty,
if
it
is
a
principle
of
justice
so
rooted
in
the
tradition
and
conscience
of
our
people
as
to
be
ranked
to
be
fundamental,
if
it
is
--
and
it
applied
this
amendment
in
the
palko
case
or
it
mentioned
this
amendment,
this
formula
in
the
palko
case
as
a
policy
of
absorption
that
has
its
source
and
the
belief
that
neither
liberty
nor
justice
could
exist
if
they
were
sacrificed.
another
formula
was
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
liberty
and
justice
which
lie
at
the
base
of
our
civil
and
political
institutions.
it
is
fundamental
and
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
it
is
natural
law
or
a
natural
right
and
also
it
is
an
absolute
right,
the
latter
however
has
not
got
beyond
the
stage
of
a
descending
opinion.
now
--
mr.
harold
strauch
that
would
not
be
to
--
that
is
something
that
--
mr.
harold
strauch
well,
it
isn't
that
the
supreme
court
has
never
reversed
itself;
sometimes
it
does
it
at
a
slower
pace
and
sometimes
at
a
faster
pace.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right,
but
now
unless
there
comes
a
point
when
there
must
be
a
determination
so
that
there
will
be
one
uniform
set
of
laws,
it
seems
to
me,
throughout
the
country.
if
these
formulas
are
valid,
and
i
assume
that
they
are,
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
why
the
members
of
the
court,
which
have
ruled
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
states,
have
conceived
that
the
--
that
the
right
not
to
incriminate
oneself
is
not
as
basic
and
as
fundamental
and
as
essential
to
justice
in
a
fair
trail,
and
is
as
firmly
rooted
in
our
traditions
as
say
the
right
to
counsel
as
in
the
sixth
amendment,
or
the
right
to
be
protected
against
illegal
searches
and
seizures
as
in
the
fourth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
have
--
the
right
to
be
protected
against
this
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
is
an
indirect
way
perhaps
of
self-incrimination.
the
court
has
been
willing
to
say
that
one
need
not
incriminate
oneself
indirectly
in
the
case
of
search
–
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
if
that
is
true,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
should
be
equally
willing
to
say
that
one
should
not
directly
incriminate
oneself
by
the
words
from
his
own
mouth.
it
strikes
me
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
as
essential
in
all
of
these
formulae
as
were
the
basis
for
permitting
other
sections
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
be
made
applicable
to
the
states.
now
if,
as
i
say,
searches
and
seizures
are
considered
to
be
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
applying
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
--
through
the
fourteenth
to
the
states,
there
is
no
valid
logical
reason
why
the
fifth
amendment
can't
be
equally
applied.
now
in
trying
to
read
the
history
--
mr.
harold
strauch
well,
that
reminds
of
fairman
and
morrison
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
who
i
think
are
in
opposition
to
justice
black.
in
the
two
stanford
law
reviews
--
professor
fairman
has
his
historical
record
of
what
happened
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
incidentally
is
refuted
somewhat
by
flack
in
1908
on
his
interpretation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
morrison
who
was
also
a
professor
at
the
stanford
law
university
has
a
supplementary
article
and
oddly
enough
he
says
in
that
article
in
effect
that
once
the
court
ruled
that
the
first
amendment
became
applicable
to
the
states,
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
the
remaining
amendments
shouldn't
be
applied
to
the
states,
and
i'm
willing
on
that
point
to
take
him
as
an
authority.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
strauch
no
i'm
talking
up
to
the
bill
of
rights.
i
mentioned
the
eight
amendments
to
the
bill
of
right.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes
sir.
and
that
is
what
professor
morrison
said.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
want
you
to
go
as
far
as
my
particular
case
is
concerned
and
worry
about
the
other
cases
in
the
future
as
they
come
up
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
ben
your
pardon.
i'm
not
willing
to
be
a
pioneer
beyond
reasonable
grounds,
distances.
now
if
i
may
refer
to
the
respondent's
brief
--
mr.
harold
strauch
oh
yes.
mr.
harold
strauch
but
i
think
incorrectly
sir.
mr.
harold
strauch
no
i
just
--
mr.
harold
strauch
the
court
said
--
mr.
harold
strauch
well
--
mr.
harold
strauch
i
am
reasonable.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
am
reasonable
sure
that
every
time
a
state
court
is,
most
of
the
times
the
state
court
is
reversed
by
this
court,
the
state
court
has
cited
federal
decisions
and
nevertheless
been
overruled.
i
don't
think
that's
binding
on
this
court.
my
impression
of
that
decision
is
that
it's
erroneous
that
it
applied
rigid
state
standards
which
were
far
greater
than
the
standards
that
are
required
in
connection
with
the
application
of
constitutional
provisions
as
set
forth
in
the
ker
case,
and
i
think
the
ker
case
is
binding
more
so
than
the
supreme
court
decision
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
you
are
referring
to
at
the
moment.
mr.
harold
strauch
it
said
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth.
it
says
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
as
such
to
state
court.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
say
it
does,
that's
--
mr.
harold
strauch
--
through
the
fourteenth
that's
my
whole
point
--
mr.
harold
strauch
however,
the
fourteenth
amendment
probably,
probably
does
prohibit
a
state
court
from
so
ruling.
but
they
say
they
are
applying
constitutional
standards
and
the
constitutional
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
applying
constitutional
standards.
and
i
don't
agree
with
that,
because
as
i
said
before,
and
this
is
my
whole
point,
they
--
they
applied
a
rigid
high
standard
as
to
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
was
required
to
testify
because
on
the
ground
that
the
testimony
couldn't
be
incriminatory.
we
say
that
testimony
could
be
incriminatory
and
the
court
should
have
applied
the
federal
standards
in
hoffman
and
so
forth,
mainly
that
if
it's
merely
possible
that
it
will
be
incriminatory
that's
sufficient
to
exclude
the
answers.
mr.
harold
strauch
well
i
differ
where
--
i
differ
where
it
says
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply.
i
think
it
applies
through
the
fourteenth.
now
the
fourteenth,
in
its
guarantee
of
due
process,
does
prohibit
from
so
ruling
on
the
claim
as
to
violate
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
justice.
i
agree
with
it.
i
merely
say
it
wasn't
applied.
mr.
harold
strauch
right,
yes
and
i
also
--
mr.
harold
strauch
that's
right,
and
i
also
say
that
this
court
has
the
power
under
ker
again,
in
determining
whether
or
not
constitutional
standards
were
properly
applied
to
review
the
entire
case
and
make
its
decision
based
upon
its
review.
mr.
harold
strauch
yes,
but
again
as
i
say
i
disagree
with
the
court
because
it
had
no
basis
at
all
for
concluding
that
this
party
was
involved
purely
in
this
particular
misdemeanor
and
is
limiting
himself
to
this
particular
misdemeanor.
he
might
have
committed
a
misdemeanor
up
until
the
day
that
he
was
heard
before
judge
inglis,
at
which
point
the
statute
of
limitation
had
not
told.
if
i
can
get
in
a
few
minutes
i
have
left
to
the
respondent's
brief
and
if
i
read
it
correctly
and
despite
--
was
that
to
stop
me
sir?
no,
and
despite
what,
might
be
said
by
--
here
this
morning,
it
seems
to
acknowledge
the
probability
that
this
court
will
concede
or
conclude
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth.
and
this
fear
was
sensed
in
the
amicus
brief
from
the
state
of
california
where
on
page
2
in
the
first
paragraph,
it
sort
of
criticized
the
connecticut
brief
for
making
this
seeming
concession.
basically,
i
think
that
the,
the
state
of
the
respondent
will
argue
that
if
the
fifth
amendment
should
be
held
to
apply
to
the
states,
the
state
courts
apply
the
constitutional
standards
in
its
findings
of
contempt,
and
that's
the
question
that
you
raised
mr.
justice
on
the
ground
that
the
questions
were
harmless
and
couldn't
incriminate
and
in
any
event
that
he
had
paid
his
penalty
couldn't
be
put
in
double
jeopardy
and
the
statute
of
limitations
had
to
intervene.
we
don't,
we
don't
concede
that
the
questions
were
harmless.
the
investigation
was
not
limited
to
gambling.
it
was
an
investigation
of
the
crime
in
general.
we
don't
know
what
crimes
the
petitioner
is
less
engaged
in
or
whether
or
not
he
was
engaged
in
crime
at
the
time
the
judge
inglis
was
taking
(inaudible)
the
fact
is
he
was
a
convicted
criminal.
he
was
probably
like
the
shoemaker
sticking
to
his
last.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
to
the
contrary,
and
there
was
no
obligation
upon
us
to
explain
whether
or
not
he
was
involved
in
any
such,
in
any
crime.
and
i
think
that
the
cases
that
hold
--
we
don't
have
to
give
any
--
explain
why
we
don't
have
to
testify
as
set
forth,
as
i
said
in
the
burt
case,
in
the
mathy
case,
and
in
the
iupa
case,
it
says,
where
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
witness
alone
would
know
whether
an
answer
to
a
particular
question
might
or
might
not
incriminate
him
and
accordingly
if
the
witness
should
say
under
oath
that
his
answer
would
incriminate
him,
the
court
can
command
no
other
testimonies
to
the
facts.
that's
a
federal
standard,
that's
a
standard
that
should
have
been
applied
it
seems
to
me
in
connecticut.
now
if
i
have
a
few
minutes
left
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
a
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
strauch
i
think
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
and
i
have
several
--
i
think
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
and
i
have
several
points
i
would
like
to
get
over
very
rapidly.
in
connection
with
the
question
that
was
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
criminal
or
a
civil
contempt,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
boyd
versus
us
case,
the
phrase
--
it
said
that
the
phrase
in
the
fifth
amendment,
"in
any
criminal
case",
includes
civil
matters
and
i
think
that's
implied
also
in
the
mapp
case.
in
connection,
one
thing
i
would
like
to
emphasize
as
an
important
point
of
our
case
is
that
the
lower
court,
the
state
court
did
not
use
the
federal
standards
and
perhaps
this
might
help
in
explaining
why
i
say
that.
the
lower
court
which
heard
the
case
before
it
went
to
supreme
court
said
that
the
questions
propounded
to
the
petitioner
do
not
indicate
a
danger
to
the
petitioner
of
criminal
liability,
which
is
real
and
appreciable.
that
is
the
test
in
the
mccarthy
case
in
connecticut,
in
110
connecticut
482.
and
our
supreme
court
on
page
21
i
think
it
is
of
the
record.
no,
our
supreme
court
in
its
decision
upheld
the
lower
court
and
it
upheld
the
lower
court
on
the
basis
of
the
mccarthy
case,
and
the
mccarthy
case
is
predicated
upon
an
old
english
case
known
as
regina
versus
boyes,
regina
versus
boyes
in
b.
&
s.
311
of
350,
that
the
danger
to
the
witness
must
be
"real
and
appreciable",
and
the
regina
and
boyes
test
was
disavowed
in
emspak
versus
united
states
case
in
349
u.s.
190.
so
that
the
state
court
was
not
applying
the
federal
constitutional
standards
as
set
forth
in
the
hoffman
case
and
the
cases
that
follow
the
hoffman
which
set
up
what
the
federal
standards
are
in
instances
of
this
sort.
with
respect
to
malloy,
i
can't
help
saying
that
insofar
as
his
activity
is
concerned,
the
only
thing
that
appears
in
the
record
is
that
it
was
a
criminal.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
legitimate
enterprise
of
any
sort,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
he
did
except
that
he
was
convicted
of
crime
on
one
occasion.
and
the
other
point
that
--
oh
and
in
connection
with
the
hoffman
case,
i
would
also
like
to
cite
the
singleton
case,
which
came
at
about
that
year
or
shortly
after
it.
in
the
singleton
case,
there
was
no
showing
by
either
the
defendant
or
the
counsel
as
to
what
the
crimes
are,
to
which
the
petitioner
was
objecting
revealing
any
information
about.
the
defendant
remained
quiet
and
the
supreme
court
held
he
was
entitled
to
do
so,
that
was
within
his
privilege.
and
as
to
whether
or
not
a
witness
should
say
anything
at
all,
is
a
matter
of
judgment.
you
can
take
the
case
of
rogers
versus
u.s.
in
340
u.s.
367
decided
1951,
where
a
woman
secretary
i
think
of
some
communist
group
did
reveal
that
she
was
the
secretary
and
that
she
had
certain
records,
and
i
think
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
that
she
had
waived
her
immunity.
so
that
malloy
was
faced
with
very
a
real
problem,
and
the
matter
of
judgment
was
that
you
don't
say
anything
because
we
don't
know
when
we
cross
the
threshold,
when
answering
questions
become
very
dangerous.
and
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
i
forgot
in
my
original
argument
was
the
basis
for
my
hope
that
the
mapp
and
the
ker
cases,
which
applied
the
fourth
to
the
state,
is
a
reason
for
us
to
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
also
be
applied,
is
that
in
connection
with
the
boyd
case,
the
bram
case,
the
weeks
case,
and
even
the
feldman
case,
there
was
language
which
said,
and
in
the
ker
case,
the
mapp
cases,
there
was
language
which
said
that
the
fourth
and
fifth
are
so
intertwined.
they
supplement
one
another,
that
it's
utterly
illogical
to
say
that
the
fourth
applies
and
the
fifth
does
not
apply.
so
that
our
argument
basically
is
twofold,
one
the
fifth
applies
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth,
and
secondly
that
even
though
the
state
of
connecticut
recognizes
that
fact,
the
state
of
connecticut
did
not
apply
the
constitutional
standards
that
it
was
obliged
to
apply
under
the
cases
of
this
court.
