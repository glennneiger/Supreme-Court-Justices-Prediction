unknown
speaker
what
is
that,
is
that
a
potential
crime?
unknown
speaker
pool?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
a
civil
contempt,
criminal
contempt
--
unknown
speaker
does
it
get
a
sentence
of
which
term?
unknown
speaker
is
he
still
in
prison?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
there
was
a
fine
too?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
it
adequate?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
when
the
fellow
has
the
keys,
who
was
on
release,
it's
a
civil
contempt
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
they
treated
it
for
the
purposes
of
habeas
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
as
a
criminal
procedure.
unknown
speaker
what
it
is
that
you
--
unknown
speaker
by
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
this
one
man
grand
jury
procedure,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well
with
whom
does
he
file
--
with
whom
does
he
file
his
report?
unknown
speaker
and
they
found
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
then
they
have
to
go
through
the
ordinary
formalities,
do
they,
or
how
do
you
prosecute
for
information
or
indictment?
unknown
speaker
so
there
might
be
a
prosecution
for
information
--
unknown
speaker
--
that's
on
the
report,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
you
are
putting
a
very
large
question
to
the
court
obviously.
now,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
question
as
to
whether
we
have
to
reach
this
question
in
this
case?
my
understanding
is
that
the
decision
of
the
connecticut
court
went
on
two
grounds,
number
one
that
without
giving
some
explanation
as
to
how
testifying
about
bet
holds
might
affect
this
man.
they
couldn't
say
that
he
had
a
valid
plea
of
self-incrimination.
number
two
that
as
far
as
his
prior
conviction
was
concerned,
there
was
no
ground
for
asserting
his
privilege,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run.
and
the
question
i
am
putting
to
you
is
assuming
the
broader
premises
that
you
are
now
arguing
to
the
court,
which
present
us
with
frankly
with
overruling
a
host
of
decisions
from
this
court.
unknown
speaker
assuming
your
premises,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
would
this
be
a
--
would
this
be
an
invalid
conviction
--
unknown
speaker
--
to
the
federal
stand.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
adamson,
snyder
against
massachusetts
and
--
unknown
speaker
a
couple
of
those
and
other
cases.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
start
with
four
members
of
this
court
have
already
indicated
those
cases
that
have
ruled.

you
just
want
to
clear.
