justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
(inaudible)
obligation
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
collection
agent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
must
--
you
would
probably
also
argue
the
executive
then
has
no
business
questioning
the
act
of
a
foreign
sovereignty.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
may
need
to
break
international
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
recognized
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
judge
made
rule
in
any
of
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
what
do
you
base
this
positive
rule
of
law,
is
it
based
on
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rabinowitz,
did
the
--
were
these
issues
raised
and
litigated
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
was
raised
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
made
this
argument
to
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
that
court's
--
what
was
that
court's
disposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
solicitor
general,
i
gather
that
you
are
in
the
court
asserting
clearly
and
equivocally
that
--
to
the
extent
there
isn't
an
act
of
state
doctrine
we
want
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
any
ambiguity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
previous
to
the
time
as,
hereby,
eliminated
as
far
as
the
views
of
the
executive
branch.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
some
court
somewhere
comes
to
silent
from
the
record
it
sent,
the
state
department
should
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
understand
the
court
below
to
have
held
that
there
would
be
an
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
that
they
would
have
adjudicated
this
matter
or
inquired
to
the
act
of
the
government
of
cuba
if
the
department
of
state
had
issued
a
--
an
explicit
request
to
apply
the
doctrine?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
there
are
only
two
alternatives.
you're
either
going
to
state
something
about
a
case
or
you're
not,
after
you've
had
some
notice
about
it.
and,
you
would
suggest
that
if
you
--
that
if
you
request
the
court
to
apply
the
doctrine,
that
the
court
should
apply
the
doctrine
and
you
also
suggest
that
you're
silent
if
the
doctrine
applies
also.
so
that
--
and
it's
only
when
you're
not
silent
and,
say,
disregard
the
doctrine
that
the
court
should
then
make
an
inquiry
into
the
validity
of
the
--
of
the
title.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
would
be
occasions
on
which
--
on
which
the
department
might
not
object
and
might
want
to
say
that
it
is
in
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hasn't,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
does
happen
that
the
department
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
hasn't
been
decided
here,
but
it's
been
decided
below,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you're
--
justice
byron
r.
white
attorney
general,
i
supposed
that,
as
you
state
this
doctrine,
it
would
also
apply
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
were
a
party
to
the
litigation
and
wanted
to
question
the
title,
and
you
would
apply
the
doctrine
rigidly
enough
to
prohibit
the
executive
himself,
whose
conduct
to
foreign
relations
supposedly
is
to
be
protected
from
also
questioning
the
title
of
this
in
the
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
sovereign
immunity,
cuban
--
therefore,
cuba
should
be
able
to
get
an
adjudication
in
our
courts
and
all
the
frozen
assets
are
really
cuban
assets
if
they
arose
out
of
confiscatory
--
well,
regardless
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
sovereign
immunity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
these
very
proceeds
are
the
perfect
example
and,
i
suppose,
if
these
proceeds
are
judged
to
be
the
property
of
cuba,
they
will
fall
within
the
freeze
order
or
whatever
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
standing
and
i
would
think
then
that
united
states
would
be
in
no
position
whatsoever
to
question
the
government
--
the
cuban
government's
title.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
only
protection
would
be
of
sovereign
immunity,
i
suppose,
in
a
suit
by
the
--
by
cuba
to
recover
$175,000.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
one
should
be
able
though
to
question
the
cuban
government's
title
to
that
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
get
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
quite
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
quite
follow,
but
nobody
can
question
the
title
of
the
cuban
government
as
far
as
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
any
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
way
to
get
it
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
until
and
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
and
unless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
property
of
the
cuban
government,
it
is
a
frozen
by
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
with
your
--
on
your
freeze
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams,
what's
your
view
of
this
case
if
there
has
been
an
unequivocal
assertion
in
the
district
court
by
the
state
department
of
the
so-called
act
of
state
doctrine?
i
take
it,
you
would
say
the
court
should
disregard
the
doctrine
question
entirely.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
have
touched
upon
the
matter
that
the
foreign
sovereign
can't
use
the
courts
here
and,
thereby,
enforce
something
that
may
be
illegal
under
international
law
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
you
would
assert
that
said
--
same
thing
even
though
the
state
department
requested
the
courts
not
to
adjudicate
the
legality,
or
not,
of
the
--
of
the
foreign
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest,
this
one
time,
that
you
can't
be
very
social
to
enforce
the
contract
that
they
made
with
an
american
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just
at
this
point
that
the
united
states
might
come
in
and
say,
"please
don't
adjudicate
that
matter
--
that
matter
of
our
foreign
policy."
you
just
accept
it.
you
would
say
the
court
should
not
accept
it
until
the
search
is
complete.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
just
reject
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
just
reject
the
previous
cases
in
this
court,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
didn't
involved
a
foreign
sovereign?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
an
adversity
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
seymour.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in
connection
with
what
i
asked
a
while
ago.
if
this
case
had
come
up
in
the
state
courts,
the
state
and
the
state
department
had
asserted
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
and
the
new
york
courts
had
said
"run
along.
we'll
apply
an
ordinary
conflicts
rule
and
we
shall
not
enforce
something
contrary
to
local
public
policy‚Äù
and
gave
judgment
against
the
cuban
government,
and
the
case
was
brought
here.
what
would
be
the
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
yours?
wouldn't
you
have
to
get
to
the
constitution?
wouldn't
it
have
to
become
then
a
matter
of
separation
ofpower?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
isn't
that
exactly
the
position
you're
in
here
when
--
since
it's
a
diversity
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
act
of
state
doctrine
that
you
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
--
what's
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rabinowitz,
assuming
it's
a
new
york
law,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
--
assuming
that
it
was
clear
under
new
york
law
that,
in
a
new
york
court,
judgment
would
be
against
your
client.
what
authority
would
the
federal
courts
have
and
this
court
to
override
that
--
not
to
follow
the
new
york
law?
where
do
you
latch
into
the
federal
system
with
international
law
or
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
act
of
state
doctrine?
is
there
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
without
--
well,
at
least
without
getting
into
the
federal
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
--
you
would
urge
that
if
it
--
that
if
the
new
york
law
governed,
you
would
urge
that
new
york
law
has
an
act
of
state
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
business
have
we
got
in
applying
our
act
of
state
doctrine,
if
we
had
one
that
you
find
in
the
federal
cases,
unless
you
can
find
it
in
a
new
york
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
and
mr.
seymour
obviously
have
a
serious
disagreement
on
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
says
it's
an
act
of
state
doctrine,
but
it
would
not
override
a
--
it
would
not
apply
in
a
case
where
there's
a
violation
of
international
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
--
no,
the
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
the
new
york
law,
then
it's
just
silent
on
what
would
--
