did
you
regard
it
to

was?
justice

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

if
i
read

does
it
indicate

(inaudible)
justice

the

it

(inaudible)
unless

says
“okay.”
that's
the
(inaudible).
justice

whether
the

was
involved
in

goldberg
and,
you're
here
to
find
a
resolution
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
--
it
certainly
doesn't
reverse
the

state
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
something
happened
as
merely
a

exists,
you
have
to

suppose
you
would
have
it
been
seizure
in

you
weren't
there.
how
long
(inaudible)
if
you
were
confronted
with
(inaudible)
this
ship,
your
production
would
be
this
crop.
justice

and
you
could
have
just
left
it
and
plead
the
(inaudible)
contract
with
a
purchaser
to
go
ahead,
but
you
have
to
win
the

if
you
get
the

out
of

and
commended
suit
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
with
record
in
view,
my
question
is
if
your
view
confirms
it
would
probably
be
encompassed
or
your
view
confirms
that
the
property
(inaudible)
commission
is
confirmed.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
goes
out
in
past
decision
--
justice
arthur

but
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
give
the
sugar
to
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
your
commissions
(inaudible)
concerns
the

of
that
facility?
justice
arthur
j.

this
is
not
in
the

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
embargo
would
complicate
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
you
have
it
sectioned
in
that
brief
about
this?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying
that
this
government
holds
corporations
if
any
government
would
only
hear
the
ambassador
of
that
government
in
their
courts?
if
the
french
take
the
statute
over
the
french
government,
must
there
be
a
reciprocity
(inaudible)
they're
suing.
we'd
sue,
and
our
courts
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
you're
distinguishing
your
own
--
by
your
last
statement
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
seymour,
is
new
york
consummately
part
of
international
law?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then,
i
suppose
that
the
question
of
international
law
will
be
explored
and
the
state
policy
will
controvert
international
law.
what
should
this
court
do
with
international
law?
