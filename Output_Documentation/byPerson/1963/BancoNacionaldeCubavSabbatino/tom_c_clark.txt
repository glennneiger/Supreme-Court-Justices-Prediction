justice
tom
c.
clark
what
has
been
suggested
is
the
court
presents
--
the
court
should
stick
its
hands
off,
i
think
you
said.
perhaps
the
better
thing
to
do
is
to
vacate
all
of
the
orders
below
and
direct
it
to
simply
dismiss.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
know
you
didn't,
but
i
think,
one
of
the
reasons
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
you
used
the
phrase
“the
courts
should
keep
their
hands
off,”
i
believe
you
said.
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
we
don't
have
any
authority,
why
shouldn't
we
make
the
decision?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
wish
to
interrupt
the
train
of
your
argument
but
i
wish
you
would
cover
somewhere
the
matter
that
i've
raised
before
in
which
you
suggested,
i
believe,
in
one
of
the
briefs,
that
we
might
--
in
order
not
to
enforce,
as
you
tell
it,
the
claim
of
the
rogue
elephant
that
we
vacate
and
direct
the
suit
to
be
dismissed.
