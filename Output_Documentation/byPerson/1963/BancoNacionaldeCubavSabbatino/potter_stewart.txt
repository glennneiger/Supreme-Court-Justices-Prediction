justice
potter
stewart
societe
general,
if
i
got
it
right,
is
the
instrument
of
the
government
of
cuba?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
how
did
banco
nacional
de
cuba
come
into
the
picture?
justice
potter
stewart
of
societe?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
the
ultimate
effect,
it
doesn't
really
make
much
difference
what
the
courts
of
england
think
about
it.
this
is
a--
justice
potter
stewart
question
of
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
law
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
united
states
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
united
states
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
well,
i've
--
since
i've
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
--
or
not
this
doctrine
applies
in
case
the
foreign
government
has
not
been
recognized
diplomatically
by
our
nation?
justice
potter
stewart
throughout
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
series
of
transactions
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
implicit
in
what
you
just
said,
mr.
rabinowitz,
that,
50
years
ago,
this
would
have
been
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
--
it's
an
ingredient
of
the
substantive
rule
of
law,
so
to
speak?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
by
enlarged,
has
been
given
a
great
deal
of
power
and
discretion
in
the
field
of
international
relations.
justice
potter
stewart
most
foreseeable
cases,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
would
be
--
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
be
a
defense
in
your
code,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
decided
cases,
the
precedence,
it
was
a
defense
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
come
up
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
take
any
position,
do
you
--
or
do
you,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
potter
stewart
that
isn't
the
position
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
take
it
in
this
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
is
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
i
hadn't
--
i
understood
mr.
katzenbach
to
be
arguing
that
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
something
that's
been
executed
--
that's
been
executed,
not
something
executory.
we're
dealing
with
a
--
with
a
feta
compli,
if
you
will,
that
the
court
of
the
--
here,
the
united
states
was
not
being
asked
to
effectuate
the
seizure
of
this
sugar
but
simply
that
the
sugar
was
seized
and
that
the
court
didn't
have
power
to
go
beyond
the
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
not
even
force
--
not
to
enforce
the
foreign
law
seeking
to
appropriate
this
but
simply
to
recognize
that
it
had
been
appropriated,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
was
seized
was
the
sugar
itself,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
ground
alone,
would
it
be
a
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
you
referred
to
the
meeting
in
athens.
wasn't
there
a
--
some
difference
of
opinion
at
that
very
meeting
as
to
whether
or
not
confiscation
without
compensation
would
be
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
want
to,
that
was
conceivable.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
state
court
made
an
error
in
its
understanding
of
international
law,
would
this
court
have
jurisdiction
to
review
it?
would
that
be
a
federal
question?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
seymour,
was
that
ship,
the
bahia
de
nipe,
owned
by
the
cuban
government?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
cuban
registry
but
was
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
fourth
--
in
the
fourth
circuit
or
in
the
district
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
issue
there
was
not
sovereign
immunity,
was
it?
the
issue
was
act
of
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
that
suggest
that
--
i
don't
know
if
that
argument
helps
you
here
very
much.
doesn't
that
suggest
that,
perhaps,
that's
the
area
in
which
these
things
ought
to
be
worked
out?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
tomorrow
or
the
next
day,
there
may
be
a
couple
more
hijacked
american
airlines.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
given
to
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
seymour,
get
to
this
in
your
own
good
course,
but
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
if
c.a.v.
is
the
bona
fide
of
cuban
national,
then
international
law
is
not
involved
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
we
know
the
lower
court
upheld
it
and
the
honorable
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
language
pointed
out
by
my
brother,
goldberg,
yesterday.
justice
potter
stewart
in
suggesting
--
just
so
i
can
follow
up
as
to
--
you're
suggesting
that,
under
the
given
circumstances,
a
dismissal
would
be
proper,
a
dismissal
of
this
petition
for
certiorari
or
a
remand
with
directions
to
the
trial
court
to
dismiss
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
direct
the
trial
court
to
dismiss
it.
