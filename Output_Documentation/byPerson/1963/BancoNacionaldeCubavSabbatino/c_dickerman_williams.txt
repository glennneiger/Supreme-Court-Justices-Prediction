mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
respondent,
farr,
whitlock
&
company
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
briefly
and
summarily,
the
situation
before
the
court
is
this.
cuba
is
an
unfriendly
power.
cuba
has
a
power
into
its
courts
neither
the
united
states
nor
its
nationals
can
obtain
justice.
cuba
adopted
a
confiscatory
decree
directed
exclusively
at
nationals
of
the
united
states,
a
decree
which
was
denounced
at
the
time
by
our
government
as
a
violation
of
international
law.
cuba
now
comes
into
our
courts
and
asks
to
use
the
processes
of
these
courts
to
enforce
that
decree
against
nationals
of
the
united
states.
i
submit
that
cuba
must
fail.
mr.
seymour
appears
here
on
behalf
of
c.a.v.
he
and
i
have
divided
our
presentation
to
this
court
in
order
to
avoid
repetition.
after
a
brief
discussion
of
the
facts,
i
shall
maintain
these
propositions.
first,
that
cuba
has
no
standing
to
sue
in
our
courts
because
cuba
is
a
foreign
sovereign
not
entitled
to
comity.
secondly,
that
whether
or
not
cuba
is
entitled
to
comity,
cuba
is
not
entitled
to
prosecute
this
action
in
our
courts
because
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
a
public
law
and
no
sovereign
may
enforce
its
public
laws
in
the
courts
of
another
sovereign.
mr.
seymour
will
show
that
the
nationalization
decree
of
august
6,
1960
was
in
breach
of
international
law,
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
apply
and
the
decision
here,
favorable
to
cuba,
will
violate
public
policy
of
the
forum.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear
that
our
position
here
is
that
of
a
stakeholder.
at
the
time
we
got
the
proceeds
of
the
bill
of
lading,
we
were
confronted
with
a
claim
by
c.a.v.
to
be
the
owner
of
the
sugar
here
involved.
that
claim
was
a
substantial
claim.
it
has
been
upheld
by
both
lower
courts.
under
the
circumstances,
we
did
what
any
other
stock
--
stakeholder
would
do.
we
held
on
to
the
money
awaiting
an
orderly
determination
of
the
rights
of
the
parties.
we
have
not
concealed
that
money.
we
have
not
removed
it
from
the
jurisdiction.
we
have
not
used
it
for
our
own
purposes,
as
it
has
been
brought
out
in
questions
directly
to
mr.
rabinowitz
and
mr.
katzenbach.
that
money
is
now
in
a
special
account
at
lehman
brothers
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court.
now
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
simply,
if
the
action
were
dismissed
on
the
merit,
certainly,
it
would
be
returned
to
c.a.v.
but,
my
answer
would
be
that
if
the
action
is
dismissed,
the
money
will
be
--
is
payable
to
c.a.v.
i
--
i
think
that's
quite
clear
under
the
terms
of
the
escrow
agreement.
i
haven't
got
it
before
me,
but
i
participated
in
its
drafting
and
that's
my
recollection
of
it.
now
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
no,
i
don't
think
so.
that's
simply
not
my
interpretation
of
the
freeze
order.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
c.a.v.
is
a
cuban
corporation.
i
don't
--
i
don't
i'm
not
fully
acquainted
with
the
--
with
the
application
of
the
freeze
order,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
c.a.v.,
since
the
freeze
order,
has
been
freely
able
to
draw
on
its
funds.
mr.
seymour,
as
counsel
to
c.a.v.,
can
answer
that
question
better
than
i.
now,
let
me
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
contracts
here
at
issue
were
made.
these
contracts
were
not
entered
into
freely,
as
the
government
brief
suggests.
we
were
compelled
to
make
these
contracts.
in
substance,
these
contracts
were
confiscated
by
the
cuban
government
by
means
of
a
nationalization
decree.
that
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
what?
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
we
--
we
were
not
in
cuba.
we
were
not
subject
to
arbitrary
force,
but
we
were
committed
on
many
long-term
contracts
involving
millions
of
dollars.
to
fulfill
those
contracts,
we
had
to
have
those
sugar
--
have
those
quantities
of
sugar.
unless,
we
can
get
sugar
out
of
cuba,
we
were
ruined.
farr,
whitlock
has
been
referred
to
here
as
a
broker.
that
is
a
common
expression
in
the
sugar
trade
but
it
is
not
strictly
accurate
from
a
legal
point
of
view.
from
the
legal
point
of
view,
a
sugar
broker
functions
more
as
a
dealer.
in
other
words,
we
had
bought
this
sugar
as
principal.
we
had
sold
the
same
sugar.
we
had
sold
the
sugar
here
involved
to
a
customer
in
morocco.
we
were
bound
not
only
to
that
customer
in
morocco,
but
to
many
other
con
--
customers.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
farr,
whitlock
would
have
been
subjected
to
suit
on
many
contracts
involving
millions
of
dollars,
as
i
say,
if
we
could
not
have
gotten
the
sugar
out
of
cuba.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
at
that
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
i
--
i
doubt
that,
your
honor,
the
reason
being
that
--
i
think
that,
perhaps,
c.a.v.
would've
had
a
valid
defense
because
it
was
the
sugar
of
c.a.v.
that
was
seized.
at
that
time,
it
wasn't
our
sugar.
actually,
it
was
being
loaded
to
supply
us
under
our
contracts
with
c.a.v.
the
--
the
steamer
hornfels
which
carried
the
sugar
to
morocco
was,
at
that
time,
being
loaded
off
the
port
of
santa
maria
and
the
loading
was
in
process
and
was
completed
shortly
after
the
decree
was
issued.
we
needed
that
sugar
to
fulfill
our
contracts,
as
i
say,
unless
we
could
fulfill
these
forward
commitments,
we
were
certainly
confronted
with,
as
it
seemed
to
us,
claims
which
we
could
not
readily
meet.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
our
commission
--
the
commissions
involved,
although
we
function
as
a
--
as
a
dealer,
our
commissions
are
relatively
small.
we
would
--
this
case
involves
far
more.
i
think
the
commission
involved
here
was
only
$1,500
and
the
commissions
in
these
other
cases
were
relatively
negligible.
if
we
could
have
gotten
out
of
these
contracts
on
the
basis
of
commissions,
we
would
have
been
very
happy
to
do
so.
it
was
to
fulfill
the
commitments
that
we
had
that
we
were
forced
by
the
nationalization
decree.
what
--
what
happened
was
that
the
cuban
authorities
would
not
let
the
steamer
hornfels
sail,
unless
we
entered
into
contacts
with
banco
para
el
comercio
exterior.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
that's
right.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
yes.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
your
honor,
our
commissions
were
negligible,
compared
to
the
amounts
involved
here.we
would
have
been
happy
to
get
out
of
these
situations
on
the
basis
of
the
commissions.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
yes,
because
it
wasn't
our
sugar.
we
were
bound
to
get,
from
some
source,
sugar.
in
other
words,
we
had
sold
sugar,
cuban
sugar,
to
a
series
of
customers
throughout
the
world.
and,
the
nationalization
decree,
the
refusal
of
the
cuban
authorities
to
permit
the
steam
--
hornfels
to
sail
and
similar
refusals
involving
other
ships
and
the
holding
up
of
sugar
deliveries
which
under
contracts
which
we
had
made
with
the
cuban
--
with
the
united
states-owned
cuban
planters,
confronted
us
with
the
inability
to
get
the
sugar
to
fulfill
our
contracts.
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
we
desire
to
get
commissions.
the
commissions
were
nominal.
as
i
say,
we
were
liable
on
these
forward
contracts
of
principles
and
we
felt
rightly
or
wrongly
that
we
would
be
sued
on
these
contracts,
that
we
would
have
a
weak
defense
because
it
was
not
our
sugar
that
had
been
confiscated.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
yes.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
you
mean
on
the
united
states
imposed
embargo?
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
the
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
--
that
--
that
was
applicable
only
to
the
importation
of
sugar
into
the
united
states.
this
particular
sugar
was
going
to
morocco.
the
embargo
in
the
united
states
would
have
not
applied
to
this
cargo.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
we're
not
anymore
because,
since
the
events
of
1960,
the
united
states
has
prohibited
all
commercial
intercourse
with
cuba.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
that's
true.
i
mean,
as
of
the
present
time,
we
could
not
do
this,
but
the
embargo
was
not
put
on
until
a
couple
of
years
later.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
we
did
not.
no,
your
honor.
now,
these
contracts
which
we
made
with
banco
exterior,
as
a
result
of
the
national
decree
and
the
procedure
of
the
cuban
authorities
under
it
in
refusing
to
permit
the
hornfels
to
sail,
were
to
be
performed
in
new
york.
in
other
words,
the
purchase
price
was
payable
in
new
york,
in
new
york
funds.
the
contracts
are
in
the
record.
section
7
deals
with
payment,
and
i
think
there's
no
question
of
that.
now,
i
submit
that
what
has
happened
here
is
that,
in
substance,
cuba
confiscated
the
contracts.
that
the
contracts
where
new
york
shows
as
an
action
enforceable
in
c
--
in
new
york
--
in
new
york
only
and
that
the
substance
of
what
has
happened
here
is
that
cuba
is
now
attempting
an
extra
territorial
application
of
the
confiscation
decree.
in
other
words,
the
net
result
of
all
that
happened
was
that
the
banco
exterior,
as
the
foreign
trade
agency
of
cuba,
acquired
--
new
york
shows
as
an
action
which
cuba
is
now
coming
into
the
new
york
courts
or
into
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
new
york
in
order
to
enforce.
now,
i
come
to
the
first
legal
proposition
which
i
shall
advocate
that
cuba
has
no
standing
to
sue
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
in
any
kind
of
case
because
cuba
is
not
entitled
to
comity.
a
foreign
sovereign
may
sue
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
only
by
virtue
of
comity.
this
court
has
so
held
on
a
number
of
occasions,
and
i
do
not
understand
that
my
learned
friend
questions
that
proposition.
now,
comity
has
two
elements
-
first,
friendliness
and,
second,
reciprocity.
neither
of
those
elements
exists
here.
in
my
brief,
i
cite
a
number
of
barely
hostile
statements
and
actions
taken
by
cuba
and
the
united
states
against
each
other.
i
put
most
of
them
in
the
appendix
because
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
anyone
could
seriously
challenge
the
fact
that
cuba
and
the
united
states
are
unfriendly
today.
however,
on
receiving
mr.
rabinowitz's
reply
brief
last
thursday,
i
find
that
he
does
maintain
that,
for
purposes
of
comity,
cuba
and
the
united
states
are
friendly
powers,
and
he
says
that
the
only
cases
in
which
the
privilege
to
sue
--
privilege
of
suit
was
denied
because
of
unfriendliness
are
cases
in
which
the
countries
involved
were
either
at
war
or
did
not
recognize
each
other.
and,
he
points
out
that,
in
this
situation,
cuba
and
the
united
states
are
not
at
war
and
that
cuba
and
the
united
states
do
recognize
each
other.
i
suggest,
however,
that
there
is
a
third
type
of
situation
which
is
inconsistent
with
friendliness,
which
affirmatively
establishes
unfriendliness,
and
that
type
of
situation
is
when
there
has
been
a
severance
of
diplomatic
relations
and
a
prohibition
of
all
commercial
intercourse.
and,
here,
i
have
to
go
outside
my
main
brief
because
i
am
dealing
with
arguments
that
i
only
learned
of
on
thursday
when
i
received
mr.
rabinowitz's
reply
brief.
now,
i
want
to
refer
--
and
mr.
rabinowitz
makes
a
persuasive
argument,
or
a
plausible
argument
perhaps,
that
the
courts
cannot
sit
on
statements
issued
by
governments
about
each
other
that,
in
the
last
four
or
five
months,
we
have
issued
critical
statements
about
france,
south
vietnam,
haiti,
and
so
on.
and,
he
argues
that
there
must
be
some
tangible
event,
and
the
only
tangible
events
that
he
says
exists
are
nonrecognition
and
war.
and,
in
answer
to
that,
i
suggest
that
there
is
a
third
type
of
tangible
situation,
namely,
as
i
say,
the
severance
of
diplomatic
relations
and
the
prohibition
of
commercial
intercourse.
now,
let
me
recite
events
--
concrete
events
which
cannot
possibly
dis
--
be
dismissed
as
mere
statements,
as
when,
for
instance,
assistant
secretary
of
state
martin
says
“our
policy
towards
cuba
is
not
coexistence.
we
want
to
get
rid
of
castro
and
communist
influence
in
cuba.”
these
are
definite
specific
actions
as
concrete
as
war
or
as
nonrecognition.
now,
on
october
19
--
and
all
these
events
had
occurred,
some
events
referred
to
in
my
brief
occurred
before
the
nationalization
decree,
others
have
occurred
since.
on
october
19,
1960,
the
united
states
prohibited
all
exports
to
cuba
with
a
few
exceptions.
january
3,
1961,
the
united
states
terminated
diplomatic
relations
and
it
terminated
those
relations
under
these
circumstances.
at
1:20
a.m.,
on
the
morning
of
january
3,
1961,
that
is
to
say,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
the
cuba
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
presented
a
note
at
the
united
states
embassy
in
havana,
instructing
the
embassy
to
reduce
its
personnel
to
11
people
within
48
hours.
the
president
of
the
united
states
regarded
that
as
insulting
and
terminated
diplomatic
relations
on
the
same
day.
on
september
7,
1961,
the
united
states
prohibited
assistance
to
any
country
which
assists
cuba,
unless
the
president
shall
otherwise
determine.
on
february
3,
1962,
the
united
states
proclaimed
a
complete
embargo
on
all
trade
with
cuba.
on
march
4,
1962,
the
united
states
prohibited
the
import
of
merchandise
from
anywhere,
made
or
arrived
in
whole
or
in
part
of
products
of
cuban
origin.
on
july
8,
1963,
they
were
issued
the
freezing
orders
to
which
reference
had
been
made
here.
the
united
states
blocked
all
assets
of
cuba
and
residents
of
cuba,
prohibited
all
persons
subject
to
the
united
states
jurisdiction
from
the
unlicensed
transfer
of
dollars
to
cuba,
and
prohibited
all
unlicensed
transactions
of
any
kind
with
cuba
or
residents
of
cuba.
now,
this,
i
submit,
your
honors,
are
measures
of
war.
they
are
tangible
events.
they
do
not
require
a
weighing
by
a
court
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
statement
is
so
unfriendly
that
it
amounts
to
unfriendliness
in
the
sense
of
comity.
these
statements
--
these
actions
cannot
possibly
be
reconciled
with
friendliness.
now,
if
we
--
if
the
court
now
--
i
will
say
--
i
think
i
can
s
--
concede
it
that
mr.
rabinowitz
is
correct
that
the
only
case
is
not
finding
friendliness
in
the
sense
of
comity
are
cases
in
which
there
was
either
war
or
nonrecognition.
however,
there
is
no
case
in
which
friendliness
in
the
sense
of
comity
was
found
to
exist
where
diplomatic
--
relations
had
been
terminated
or
where
commercial
intercourse
had
been
prohibited.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
an
open
one
and
i
submit
that
in
the
sense
in
which
comity
is
used
in
the
various
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
my
brief,
and
as
i
believe
these
statements
are
all
admitted
by
the
other
side,
i
submit
that
these
are
effective
ways
of
establishing
that
unfriendliness.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
i
don't
understand.
the
department
of
state
is
a
--
has
appeared
in
the
case.
it's
only
the
department
of
justice.
i
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
have
--
i
don't
--
frankly,
i
don't
understand
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice
and
i
don't
feel
that
i'm
in
the
position
to
interpret
it.
however,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
legal
decisions
on
the
case,
the
legal
decisions
on
comity,
the
legal
decisions
--
the
court
decisions
are
entirely
clear
that
friendliness
must
exist
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
these
statements,
actions,
prohibitions,
severance
of
diplomatic
relations
establish
that
the
friendliness
does
not
exist.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
i
--
i
agree
that
the
courts
cannot
enter
into
whether
or
not
relations
are
platonic
or
otherwise,
but
when
there
are
specific
events
susceptible
to
only
one
interpretation,
i
submit
that
the
courts
could
act
accordingly.
i
don't
--
i
do
not
see
that
the
courts
are
dependent
upon
the
executive
in
applying
the
law.
the
--
i
do
not
understand
the
theory
of
bernstein
which
is
--
has
been
referred
to
here,
namely,
that
the
courts
must
have
the
permission
of
the
executive
branch
before
deciding
any
question
which
is
presented
to
them.
i
--
i
submit
here
that
there
are
specific
events
which
fall
within
the
rule
which
has
been
laid
down
by
the
courts
and
there's
no
suggestion
in
any
of
those
decisions
or
any
of
those
opinions
that
it
is
necessary
to
get
any
particular
finding
from
the
executive
branch.
the
executive
branch
has
performed
its
function
when
it
severed
diplomatic
relations,
when
it
prohibited
commercial
intercourse.
now,
the
consequences
of
those
actions
by
the
executive
branch
is
not
what
the
executive
branch
says
about
them,
but
what
interpretation
this
court
puts
on
them.
certainly,
although
my
learned
friends
had
my
brief
for
some
time
now,
they
have
not
--
they
do
not
affirmatively
say
here
that
comity
exists.
they
have
not
said
that
cuba
is
a
friendly
power.
they
have
not
repudiated,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
any
of
the
--
in
any
statements
by
the
executive
branch
or
any
of
the
actions
by
the
executive
branch
showing
that
there
is
no
friendliness
between
the
united
states
and
cuba.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
the
case
has
entirely
established
that
proposition.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
it
ended
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
i
don't
think
they
could,
your
honor.
i
think
are
--
the
independent
--
the
juris
--
judiciary
is
entirely
independent
branch
of
our
government.
of
course
that
has
not
happened
here
but,
even
if
they
did,
i
would
submit
that,
after
such
events,
as
i
have
described,
have
taken
place,
the
executive
branch
could
not
come
in
and
say
“oh,
we
didn't
mean
it”
or
there
is
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
your
honor,
i
certainly
think
it's
up
to
the
executive
branch
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
terminate
diplomatic
relations
and
whether
or
not
to
prohibit
commercial
intercourse.
obviously,
the
judiciary
cannot
attempt
to
do
that
kind
of
thing,
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
what
application
shall
be
made
in
a
lawsuit
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
that,
i
think
is
a
judicial
question
and
not
an
executive
question.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well
i
would
submit
that
there
is
another
feature
which
is
persuasive
of
the
rule
that
i
advocate
and,
that
is,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ex
parte
muir
in
which
the
court
said,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
that's
254
united
states
522,
that
a
foreign
government
could
litigate
in
our
courts
only
through
official
channels,
only
through
an
accredited
representative,
and
that
an
appearance
by
private
counsel
was
not
enough.
now,
because
--
well,
for
what
reason,
i
don't
know.
certainly,
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
appearance
by
an
accredited
representative.
i'd
--
i
certainly
don't
challenge
mr.
rabinowitz's
authority
to
appear,
but
he
appears
as
private
counsel,
not
as
a
--
not
as
an
ambassador
of
cuba
and,
in
fact,
i
understand
that,
in
some
related
litigation,
he
insists
very
clearly,
a
litigation
in
which
this
court
only
the
last
week
granted
certiorari,
that
he
is
only
a
private
counsel.
now
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
as
i
read
ex
parte
muir,
there
must
be
an
accredited
representative.
of
course,
in
this
particular
instance,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
the
sugar
belongs
to
cuba.
it
was
cuba
which
confiscated
the
sugar
for
its
own
benefit
and,
my
recollection
--
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
the
complaint
says
that
banco
nacional
is
suing
here
as
financial
agent
of
the
government
of
cuba.
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that
this
is
something
that
happened
in
the
regular
activity
of
a
public
corporation.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
i'm
only
saying
that
i
think
it's
unnecessary
to
this
particular
case
but,
as
i
read
ex
parte
muir
and
the
cases
cited
in
ex
parte
muir,
for
instance,
one
of
those
cases
is
the
anne.
in
the
anne,
the
court
refused
to
entertain
a
claim
made
on
behalf
of
spain
by
the
spanish
consul
because
the
court
regarded
the
claim
as
not
being
commercial
but
is
diplomatic
and
it
regarded
an
appearance
by
someone
with
diplomatic
status
as
necessary
to
the
presentation
of
the
claim
of
spain.
and,
i
suggest
also
that
this
requirement
of
the
appearance
by
an
accredited
representative,
as
distinguished
from
private
counsel,
has
a
real
application
to
litigation
by
cuba
in
our
courts,
and
that
that
is
shown
by
the
case
of
rich
against
naviera
vacuba,
a
case
which
is
cited
with
great
enthusiasm
by
my
learned
friend.
in
that
case,
it
appears
that
cuba
was
entitled
--
was
held
entitled
to
repudiate
a
formal
court
stipulation
entered
into
under
the
most
solemn
circumstances,
by
which,
cuba
waived
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
the
execution
of
the
judgment
which
was
entered
into
in
that
case.
and,
yet,
because
that
stipulation
was
entered
into
by
private
counsel
and
the
court
opinion
indicates
that
private
counsel
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
that
he
was
duly
authorized
to
do
so,
there
was
no
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
behavior
of
private
counsel.
but,
because
he
was
only
a
private
counsel
and
not
an
accredited
representative,
therefore,
cuba
was
permitted
to
repudiate
that
stipulation.
i
--
i
might
say
that
rich
against
naviera
vacuba
is
the
case
involving
the
buoyed
need
which
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
rabinowitz
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
now,
another
essential
element
of
comity
is
reciprocity,
and
this
essential
element
exists
wholly
apart
from
friendliness.
the
leading
case
laying
down
the
law
on
reciprocity
as
the
essential
element
of
comity
is
hilton
against
guyot,
a
case
in
which
the
question
before
the
court
was
the
effect
to
be
given
to
a
judgment
of
the
courts
of
france.
at
the
time
of
that
decision,
there
was
on
question
of
unfriendliness
between
the
united
states
and
france.
the
decision
came
down
in
1895,
when
the
two
countries
were
entirely
friendly.
the
--
this
court,
however,
went
into
a
most
detailed
examination
of
the
requirements
of
re
--
of
comity,
insofar
as
reciprocity
was
concerned,
and
established
that
our
courts
would
function
--
would
accord
the
nationals
of
foreign
sovereigns
only
the
rights
that
those
foreign
sovereigns
accorded
our
nationals.
and,
in
that
case,
because
the
judgment
of
the
courts
of
france
--
in
that
case,
because
it
appeared
that
the
law
of
france
was
that
the
courts
of
france
could
revise
--
could
examine
and
revise
court
judgments
of
other
countries,
therefore,
our
courts
could
reexamine
judgments
of
the
courts
of
france.
now,
there
has
been
a
very
recent
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit,
p&e
shipping
corporation
against
banco
exterior,
another
cuban
litigation,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals,
of
its
own
motion,
raised
this
question
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
judge
to
make
findings
as
to
whether
or
not
nationals
of
the
united
states
could
get
justice
in
cuba.
and,
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
court,
in
fact,
the
court
instructed
the
district
judge
to
inquire
from
the
department
of
state,
which
he
did,
and
the
department
of
state
wrote
a
letter
to
the
district
judge,
which
is
appendix
b
to
my
main
brief.
and,
in
that
letter
from
the
department
of
state
to
the
district
judge,
the
department
said
that
there
had
been
a
breakdown
in
the
cuban
judiciary
as
an
independent
branch
of
the
cuban
government.
but
the
cuban
judiciary
was
now
subservient
to
the
present
political
policies
of
the
cuban
executive
and
that
the
department
had
concluded
that
even
if
legal
remedies
theoretically
existed
under
cuban
law,
recourse
by
a
united
states
national
to
those
remedies
would
be
futile.
now,
i
learned
for
the
first
time
when
i
received
mr.
rabinowitz's
reply
brief
on
thursday
that,
in
this
proceeding,
mr.
rabinowitz,
on
behalf
of
cuba,
had
submitted
affidavits
that
claimed
to
show
that
united
states
nationals
could
have
recourse
and
could
receive
fair
treatment
in
the
cuban
courts.
i
have
examined
those
affidavits
and,
all
i
can
say
--
they
are
too
detailed
to
review
here.
all
i
can
say
is,
after
examining
those
affidavits,
that
i
profoundly
disagree
with
mr.
rabinowitz's
characterization
of
that,
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
court
is
not
satisfied
with
the
report
of
the
department
of
state
as
to
judicial
conditions
in
cuba,
that
it
do
what
the,
and
it
regards
this
issue
as
determinative
of
the
question
of
comity,
that
it
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
for
findings
in
that
respect.
now,
i
come
to
my
secondly
proposition
and
that
is
this,
that
whether
or
not
cuba
is
entitled
to
comity,
cuba
may
not
prosecute
this
action
because
known
foreign
sovereign
may
enforce
its
public
laws
in
the
course
of
the
united
states.
in
fact,
the
rule
is
universal.
no
--
the
courts
of
no
sovereign
will
entertain
suits
by
other
sovereigns
for
enforcement
of
their
public
laws.
now,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
reference
here
to
the
so-called
act
the
state
doctrine.
there
is
an
equally
well-settled
act
of
state
doctrine
which
i
invoke
and,
that
is,
that
although
the
courts
will
not
undue
the
acts
of
state
in
a
foreign
power,
neither
will
they
enforce
those
acts
of
state.
now,
as
i
understand
mr.
katzenbach's
distinction
of
this
rule,
which
he
seems
to
admit
thoroughly,
in
fact,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
he
used
the
expression
“hundreds
of
times”
the
courts
have
laid
down
this
rule,
his
dis
--
his
--
he
distinguishes
it.
he
distinguishes
this
case
on
the
ground
that,
as
in
a
general
way
or
they
--
more
often,
it's
more
frequent
that
the
question
of
the
act
of
state
comes
up
the
other
way
around.
that
is
to
say,
it
comes
up
as
a
defensive
matter
between
private
parties,
so
to
speak,
rather
than
as
a
suit
by
the
foreign
sovereign
to
enforce
that
act
of
state.
well,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
argument
is
not
applicable.
of
course
the
court
here
is
dealing
with
this
case,
not
some
theoretical
case
or
not
some
usual
case.
it's
dealing
with
what
happens
here
and
my
learned
friends
have
sug
--
cited
no
case
whatsoever
in
which
a
foreign
sovereign
was
held
entitled
to
enforce
an
act
of
state,
directly
or
indirectly,
in
the
courts
of
another
sovereign.
i
won't
--
i
won't
go
through
the
--
through
the
cases.
apparently,
they
--
it
is
conceded
that
they
are
applicable
and,
the
only
distinction
is
made,
that
it
is
more
likely
that
the
question
arise
because
a
man
is
defending
on
the
ground.
it's
putting
up
the
defendant
who
is
pleading
the
act
of
state
rather
than
the
foreign
sovereign
involved.
of
course,
as
i
say
here,
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
where
the
foreign
sovereign
is
asserting
the
act
of
state.
and
this
court,
in
guaranty
trust
company
against
the
united
states,
was
most
emphatic
in
drawing
a
distinction
between
those
cases
in
which
the
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign
might
come
up
in
the
course
of
a
litigation,
let
us
say,
between
private
parties
and
a
case
in
which
that
foreign
sovereign,
itself,
was
seeking
to
enforce
its
public
laws.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
--
that
the
posture
of
the
case
shows
that
the
foreign
sovereign
is
trying
to
enforce
its
law.
the
--
the
new
york
cases
are
quite
clear
that,
when
there
is
a
contract
between
the
parties
and
property
is
turned
over
to
one
of
those
parties
pursuant
to
the
contract,
his
failure
to
make
use
of
that
property
according
to
the
terms
of
the
contract
presents
a
case
of
breach
of
contract
as
distinguished
from
conversion.
now,
here,
we
were
forced
or
we
were
subjected
to
pressure
which
lead
us
to
make
these
contracts.
those
contracts
would
be
to
perform
in
new
york.
cuba
is
now
coming
into
the
new
york
courts,
as
i
see
it,
to
enforce
those
contracts.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
actually,
it
really
wasn't
seized.
it
was
onboard
the
hornfels.
it
was
in
cuban
territorial
waters
or
is
said
to
be
--
said
to
have
been
in
cuban
territorial
waters.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that
any
officer
of
the
cuban
government
ever
went
onboard.
i
mean,
the
possession
is
a
--
such
a
purely
theoretical
legal
possession.
it
was
never
reduced
to
actual
possession,
as
i
read
the
record.
what
did
happen,
and
what
i
tried
to
emphasize,
is
that,
by
virtue
of
these
--
of
this
decree
and
cuba's
procedure
under
it,
we've
made
this
contract
to
be
performed
in
new
york.
and,
in
substance,
cuba
is
trying
to
enforce
that
contract
now.
it's
trying
to
get
the
money.
of
course,
cuba
is
interested
in
sugar
only
partly
for
purposes
of
consumption.
primarily,
it
is
interested
in
sugar
from
the
point
of
view
of
foreign
exchange.
what
cuba
wanted
was
foreign
exchange.
it
made
a
contract
by
which
it
was
to
get
that
foreign
exchange
in
new
york.
now,
it
has
come
into
the
new
york
courts
or
the
federal
court
sitting
in
new
york
in
order
to
enforce
that
contract
and
get
that
foreign
exchange.
i
--
i
trust
i've
answer
you
question,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
want
to
get
into
act
of
state,
because
--
myself,
because
mr.
seymour
is
going
to
deal
with
that
subject
and
i
don't
want
to
answer
it
in
anyway
which
might
embarrass
him
or
be
inconsistent.
we
--
as
i
say,
we've
divided
the
argument
so
that
he
will
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
i
--
i
have
said
that
it
isn't
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
yes,
i
would.
mr.
seymour
is
going
to
deal
with
that
subject
more
fully,
but
that's
certainly
my
own
position.
furthermore,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
this,
that
is,
that
foreign
sovereigns
are
not
entitled
to
enforce
any
public
law,
even
if
it's
a
desirable,
commendable
public
law.
many
of
the
cases
involve
taxes.
tax
revenue
laws
are,
of
course,
public
laws
and
the
courts
have
been
forbidden
to
enforce
the
--
the
courts
have
refused
to
entertain
the
claims
of
foreign
sovereigns
when
directly
or
indirectly
based
upon
a
revenue
law.
there
wasn't
any
question
of
the
violation
of
the
--
the
revenue
law
was
a
perfectly
proper
exercise
of
domestic
jurisdiction.
it's
not
suggested
that
the
revenue
law,
in
some
of
these
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
my
brief,
such
as
peter
buchanan
ltd.
against
mcvey,
was
an
improper
law.
the
court
conceded
that
it
was.
it
simply
held
that
no
act
of
state,
whether
or
not
it
was
valid
under
international
law,
could
be
enforced
to
a
subject
to
enforcement
in
the
courts
of
the
other
sovereign.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
no,
but
i
--
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
if
i
did.
i
--
i
say
that
when
a
foreign
sovereign
seeks
to
enforce
a
contract
and
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
is
subject
to
the
public
policy
of
the
forum,
and
it's
quite
clear,
both
from
cases
which
i
cite
in
my
brief
and
which
mr.
seymour
cites
in
his
brief,
that
a
contract
of
this
type,
rested
on
confiscation,
violation
of
the
public
policy
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
no,
i
--
i
we
have
an
independent
judiciary
here,
as
i
understand
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that
the
judiciary
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
of
the
united
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
no,
i
don't
think
those
cases
are
involved.
those
--
those
previous
case
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
because
they
didn't
involve
sover
--
foreign
sovereign
seeking
to
enforce
acts
of
state.
those
were
cases
--
and
this
is
an
interesting
distinction
made
by
a
number
of
the
cases,
in
particular,
an
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
in
moore
against
mitchell
and
a
very
persuasive
and,
indeed,
eloquent
opinion
by
justice
kingsmill
moore
in
peter
buchanan
ltd.
against
mcvey.
the
reason
given
for
refusing
to
entertain
efforts
by
foreign
sovereigns
to
enforce
their
public
laws
in
these
two
opinions
is
this,
that
always
there
is
open
to
the
court
of
the
forum
the
consideration
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
or
law,
whatever
it
may
be,
is
consistent
with
the
public
policy
of
the
forum.
now,
in
private
litigation,
a
court
can
determine
that
a
particular
act
of
state
of
a
foreign
sovereign
is
not
consistent
with
a
public
policy
or
a
particular
law
of
the
foreign
sovereign
is
not
consistent
with
its
public
policy.
but,
in
litigation
brought
up
by
a
foreign
sovereign,
it
is
embarrassing
to
international
relations
for
a
court
to
have
to
say
"we
don't
like
this
law."
and,
justice
moore
points
out
that
many
of
the
laws
of
today
may
be
shocking
to
the
conscience
of
the
forum.
the
party
says,
such
laws
meaning
public
laws,
have
been
used
for
racial
and
religious
discriminations,
for
the
furtherance
of
social
policies
and
ideals
dangerous
to
the
security
of
adjacent
countries,
and
for
the
direct
furtherance
of
economic
warfare.
now,
it
says
the
forum
must
always
reserve
the
right
to
declare
a
particular
law
or
act
contrary
to
its
public
policy
and
it
embarrasses
--
it
is
embarrassing
to
make
that
finding
in
a
case
in
which
the
foreign
government,
itself,
sues.
now,
in
other
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
surely.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
well,
of
course
i'm
arguing
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
dickerman
williams
that
is
true.
but,
i
--
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
continue
with
justice
white's
question.
my
learned
friends,
in
their
briefs,
seem
to
take
the
position
that
the
courts,
in
order
to
keep
foreign
relations
in
a
friendly
way,
must
always
enforce
their
acts
of
state.
what
was
held
in
moore
against
mitchell,
and
peter
buchanan
ltd.,
and
similar
cases,
is
that
because
policy
is
involved,
therefore,
the
court
should
never
entertain
actions
by
foreign
sovereigns
involving
public
laws.
your
honor,
i've
completed
my
argument.
i
received,
as
i
think
i
have
said,
mr.
rabinowitz's
learned
reply
brief
on
thursday.
as
a
result
of
which,
i
revised
to
some
extent
my
position,
my
views,
on
the
subject
of
friendliness
and
comity.
i
have
a
rebuttal
brief
here
already
printed.
it's
only
five
pages
long
and
i've
given
copies
of
it
to
mr.
rabinowitz,
mr.
katzenbach,
and
mr.
seymour.
and,
i
would
respectfully
request
leave
to
file
it
in
the
court.
