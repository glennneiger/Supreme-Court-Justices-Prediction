mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
today
as
amicus
in
this
litigation
to
argue
only
the
act
of
state
question.
that
question
is
phrased
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
“whether
a
court
of
the
united
states
is
free
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
decree
of
a
recognized
foreign
government
affecting
title
to
property
within
its
territorial
jurisdiction.
now,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
raised
the
question,
it
was
answered
by
mr.
rabinowitz,
i'd
like,
at
the
outset,
to
say
that
i
agree
that
this
case
is
not
a
moot
case
for
the
reasons
essentially
expressed
by
mr.
rabinowitz
that
the
treasury
department
regulations
do
prevent
the
transfer,
and
so
forth,
of
any
assets
except
under
a
license
and
that
those
assets
are
presently
frozen.
however,
a
judgment
is
not
prohibited
and
there
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
in
this
court
that
says
that
a
--
where
a
judgment
can
be
rendered
to
clarify
title
to
something
or
the
rights
of
someone,
even
if
those
proceeds
are
frozen
at
that
point,
that
that
case
is
not
a
moot
case.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
fact
of
that
regulation
has
some
relevance
to
matters,
which
i'll
make
later
in
my
argument,
because
it
demonstrates,
to
a
degree,
a
--
an
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
problems
of
this
kind.
that
is
to
say,
again
mr.
rabinowitz
had
paid
some
note
of
it,
often,
these
claims
for
property
which
is
confiscated
by
a
foreign
government
can
be
paid
from
such
frozen
assets
and,
in
any
event,
the
fact
of
the
frozen
assets
is
sometimes
an
inducement
to
a
foreign
government
to
discuss
the
problem
of
compensation.
i
think
there's
no
need
for
me
to
go
over
the
essential
facts
again,
but
i
would
like
to
give
emphasis
to
the
two
facts
in
this
case.
one
is
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
sugar
involved
in
this
case
was
in
cuba
at
the
time
of
the
relevant
decree.
and,
the
second
fact
that
i
would
like
to
give
emphasis
to
is
that
possession
of
that
sugar
was
taken
on
behalf
of
the
cuban
government
and
that
the
title
of
the
cuban
government
at
that
time
was
recognized
by
farr,
whitlock,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
releasing
the
sugar
to
get
it
on
to
the
ultimate
purchaser,
so
they
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
decree
which
simply
was
sort
of
a
bruiting
omnipresence.
we're
dealing
with
a
decree
which
was
in
fact,
where
measures
--
inappropriate
measures
by
those
standards
were
taken
by
the
cuban
government
to
reduce
that
sugar
to
its
possession
in
cuba.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
--
i
think
not.
the
--
the
facts
are
described
in
an
affidavit
from
farr,
whitlock
to
the
effect
that
the
ship
was
not
permitted
to
move
until
the
purchasers
of
these
sugar
put
aside
their
other
contracts
and
entered
into
identical
contracts
with
the
agency
of
the
--
of
the
cuban
government.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
your
honor,
as
i
understand.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful,
again
at
the
outset,
if
i
indicate
some
of
the
points
that
the
government
is
not
arguing.
we
feel
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
one
of
judicial
creation,
that
this
court
is
entirely
free
to
abandon
it
or
to
modify
it
if
persuasive
reasons
exist
for
this
court
taking
that
action.
the
government
does
not
believe
that
such
reasons
exist.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
there's
no
question
of
judicial
power,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
i
think
this,
that
there
are
overtones
of
foreign
relations
to
it
and
while,
again,
the
government
would
not
argue
any
constitutional
allocation
or
separation
in
this
case,
we
do
believe
that
considering
the
proper
allocations
of
governmental
functions
is
something
which
might
lead
to
this
court's
believing
it
wise
to
adhere
to
its
prior
precedence.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
i
wish
to
make
it
clear.
we
were
not
arguing
that.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
it
is
--
some
of
the
reasons
for
the
substantive
rule
of
law
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
exect
--
in
fact
that
the
executive
branch
can,
by
enlarged,
deal
better
with
this
problem.
if
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
--
that's
absolutely
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
could
mean
that,
your
honor.
the
--
the
so-called
bernstein
exception
is
not,
i
believe,
before
this
court.
while
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
correspondence
in
this
case,
which
was,
we
believe,
informal
and
unofficial,
and
construed
that
as
a
bernstein
type
of
letter
and,
therefore,
placed
its
decision
on
those
grounds.
that
point,
since
the
solicitor
general
in
his
memorandum
made
note
that
the
government
did
not
so
intend
it,
has
not
been
pressed
by
any
of
the
parties
here
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
that
question
and,
unless
the
court
wishes
otherwise,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
this
case
is
un
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
case
is
inappropriate.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
believe
that
there
has
been
any
ambiguity
prior
to
this
time
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
in
the
decisions
of
other
courts
which
have
followed
those
decisions.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
suppose
that
--
again,
you're
phrasing
the
bernstein
question
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
your
honor
--
and
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
this
a
positive
rule
of
law
and
the
question
is,
as
you
put
it,
whether
this
positive
rule
of
law
changes
if
the
department
of
state
should
say,
in
so
far
is
the
foreign
relations
of
united
states
are
concerned,
“we
have
no
objection
to
a
court's
inquiring
this
far.”
i
think
this
court
would
be
free
to
adopt
that
modification
as
it
would
be
free
to
adopt
any
other
modification.
i
don't
urge
the
bernstein
exception
upon
this
court
at
this
time
and
i
don't
urge
that
it
not
remain
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
since
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
i
was
not
going
to
urge
it
and,
by
not
urging
it,
i
do
not
be
wish
to
understood
as
representing
the
views
of
the
government
that
it
is
opposed
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
to
that.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
be
opposed
to
that.
if
there
is
bernstein
exception,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
made
by
clear
and
unequivocal
and
formal
letter
from
an
appropriate
official
of
the
government.
i
think
it
perhaps
should,
and
this
may
be
my
parochial
views
on
the
department
of
justice,
be
one
that
would
be
submitted
through
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
would
be
unique,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
it
would
peculiar.
if
the
reason
for
the
rule
--
if
the
reason
for
the
rule
were
that,
in
general,
this
would
interfere
with
international
relations,
then
an
assurance
from
the
appropriate
branch
of
the
government
that,
in
this
case,
it
would
not
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
perfectly
sensible
and
intelligent
rule.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
mean
that
the
court
would
then
go
ahead
and
do
it.
it
would
merely
--
be
merely
stating
to
the
court
that,
insofar
as
that
consideration
would
govern
them,
in
this
case,
it
did
not,
in
fact,
in
the
judgment
of
those
charges
in
conducting
foreign
relations,
appear
to
be
applicable.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
see
why,
your
honor,
that
would
follow.
if
this
is,
as
it
was
called
by
this
court
in
the
ricaud
case,
a
rule
of
decision,
if
this
is
what
i
would
call
an
ironclad
complex
rule
which
can
appropriately
be
laid
down
by
this
court
and
binding
upon
all.
because
of
the
reasons
for
the
rule,
i
don't
see
why
the
fact
that
you
have
a
--
whether
it's
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant,
should
make
any
difference.
indeed,
that
point
is
pressed
repeatedly
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondents
in
this
who
would
seem
to
make
it
appear
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
a
court
of
the
united
states
will
enforce
a
foreign
decree
of
this
kind,
and
they
repeatedly
use
the
word
"enforce."
well,
it
is
perfectly
true
that
there's
a
whole
line
of
decisions
and
authority
with
this
respect
to
such
decrees
which
says
that
courts
in
the
united
states
will
not
enforce
confiscatory
decrees,
will
not
enforce
decrees
which
are
penal
in
their
nature,
which
will
not
enforce
decrees
which
have
public
policy
exceptions.
there's
a
whole
--
just
hundreds
of
cases
to
this
effect,
but
this
case
is
not
a
case
of
that
kind.
this
case
is
not
a
case
of
that
kind
because,
here,
the
property
was
reduced
to
the
possession
of
the
cuban
government
while
in
cuba.
and,
it's
a
mere
accident
that
the
case
appears
in
the
way
in
which
it
does.
as
to
say,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
accident
of
some
negotiable
paper
being
in
the
hands
of
farr,
whitlock
in
this
case,
then
the
only
thing
that
c.a.v.
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
have
attempted
to
enjoin
that
payment
or
to
have
sought
the
money
from
the
--
in
the
hands
of
the
agent
of
the
cuban
government.
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
would
have
been
blocked
either
--
be
it
by
sovereign
immunity
if
this
case
was
directly
against
an
agent
of
the
cuban
government
or
the
cuban
government,
or
it
would
have
been
blocked
by
the
act
of
state
doctrine
if
in
the
hands
of
somebody
else.
there,
it
would
have
been
used
as
a
matter
of
defense.
so,
i
cannot
attach
any
great
significance
to
the
rather
odd
fact
here
in
the
rather
unique
circumstances
that
this
happens
to
be
an
argument
made
by
a
plaintiff
in
defense
of
his
title
because
the
money
seems
to
have
--
or
what
represent
of
the
money
slipped
out
of
his
hands.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
wise
for
this
court
or
for
any
court
to
make
that
kind
of
distinction.
to
say
you
contest
the
title
if
you
are
able
to
get
hold
of
the
property,
however
you
get
hold
of
it
but,
otherwise,
it's
barred
because
it
makes
a
difference
whether
you
appear
as
plaintiff
or
as
defendant.
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
a
wise
route.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
most
foreseeable
circumstance
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct
because
this
is
the
way
it
would
ordinarily
come
up
in
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
the
--
in
the
property
cases
or,
indeed,
to
go
to
the
earlier
precedent,
in
the
cases
where
tort
was
being
claimed.
indeed,
the
origin
of
the
act
of
state,
whatever
its
origin,
it
may
be
old,
say
that
it
is,
whether
it
is
or
not,
had
its
first
expression
in
this
country
in
underhill
against
hernandez
which
was
a
suit
in
tort
brought
against
mr.
hernandez
after
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
government
official
for
acts
that
he
had
committed
in
venezuela
in
terms
of
what
was
called
unlawful
imprisonment,
assault.
and,
in
that
case,
this
court
first
pronounced
that
doctrine
and
said
that,
and
the
quote
which
is
so
often
quoted
in
the
cases,
“that
every
sovereign
state
is
bound
to
respect
the
independence
of
every
other
sovereign
state
and
the
courts
of
one
country
will
not
sit
in
judgment
on
the
acts
of
the
government
of
another
done
within
its
own
territory.”
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
you
can
a
--
it
can
be
argued
that
there
is
and
that
this
is
derived
in
part
from
sovereign
immunity.
in
the
case
such
as
underhill
against
hernandez,
it
would
seem
look
like
a
part
of
a
sovereign
immunity.
and,
the
same
argument
can
be
made
that
if
the
state
takes
property
and
then
gives
it
to
a
third
person,
since
you
couldn't
sue
the
foreign
state
for
it,
you
can't
sue
that
person.
but,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
distinct
from
sovereign
immunity
because
sovereign
immunity
can
only
come
to
play
when
the
sovereign
is
in
court.
it's
a
--
it's
a
jurisdictional
matter.
the
act
of
state
is
not
and,
in
addition
to
that,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
main
motivation
of
those
who
are
arguing
this,
derived
from
sovereign
immunity,
is
to
take
the
next
jump
and
say
“we
don't
like
sovereign
immunity
anymore,
so
we
don't
like
act
of
state
anymore.”
now
the
reasons
that
sovereign
immunity
has
been
cut
down
in
some
ways
has
been
because
of
the
extent
to
which
governments
were
involved
in
commercial
activities
rather
than
in
what
we
regarded
as
more
purely
governmental
activities
and,
perhaps,
the
same
exception
could
be
made
here,
but
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
do
it
because,
clearly,
when
the
government
of
cuba
takes
this
sugar
there,
it's
not
acting
in
a
commercial
way,
even
though
the
product
may
be
commercial.
it's
acting
--
affecting
in
a
pretty
sovereign
way,
perhaps,
too
sovereign
a
way.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and
that's
the
good
reason
for
cutting
down
on
sovereign
immunity
where
it's
engaged
in
commercial
operations.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
applies
to
the
acts
done
in
its
sovereign
capacity
and,
certainly,
expropriation
is
not
an
act
done
in
a
commercial
capacity.
i
can't
think
of
a
more
sovereign
act
than
that
kind
of
seizure.
now,
it's
been
argued
that
these
cases,
the
--
primarily,
the
underhill
case
and
the
oetjen
case
and
the
ricaud
case
which
are
the
clearer
statements
of
this
--
by
this
court,
it
has
been
argued
by
scholars
for
some
time
that
perhaps
this
doctrine
should
be
changed
and
perhaps
it's
no
longer
applicable
today.
there
has
been
some
efforts
to
distinguish
those
cases
and,
to
a
degree,
they
can
be
distinguished.
that
is
to
say,
it
can
be
said
this
point
was
never
made
to
the
court.
it's
never
argued
to
the
court
forcibly
in
those
cases
or,
in
at
least
oetjen,
it
couldn't
have
been
international
violation.
there
was
--
a
mexican
was
involved
and,
in
underhill,
they
doubted
that
it
was
a
violation
of
international
law
anyhow
and
so
forth.
these
arguments
are
made
in
the
respondent's
briefs.
they're
good
arguments.
they've
been
made
by
scholars.
i
think
they're
respectable
arguments,
but
i
think
that
this
court
ought
to
face
the
fact
quite
candidly
that
what,
as
i
think,
the
respondents
do,
that
they
are
asking
for
a
change
in
this
doctrine
when
they
ask
that
an
exception
for
alleged
violations
of
international
law
be
made
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
because
it
is
quite
clear
from
those
cases
and
from
the
way
in
which
the
court
spoke
in
those
cases
that
it
had
considered
this
fact.
at
least
it
was
aware
of
this
fact,
because,
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
is
a
statement
that
the
remedy,
if
it
exists,
lie
through
diplomatic
channel,
which
is
certainly
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
international
matters
were
involved.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
take
any
position.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
department
of
state
has
said
that
it
was.
if
my
argument
required
me
to
take
a
position,
i'm
acting
on
the
assumption
that
it
was,
mr.
justice,
and
i
believe
very
firmly
that
it
was
on
the
facts
that
i
know,
but
that's
not
a
position
that's
necessary
for
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
our
argument
and
i
will
assume
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
would
assume,
for
the
purposes
of
the
--
my
argument
would
be
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
transaction
is
made
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
it
is
a
clear-cut
violation
of
international
law.
i
think
that
the
point
that
i've
been
making
is
that
the
precedent,
as
it
exist,
would
very
clearly
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
now,
let
me
use
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may,
to
deal
with
what
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
important
matter
before
this
court,
and
that
is
whether,
today,
it
would
be
a
wise
policy
to
create
the
exception
to
this
doctrine
which
respondents
have
urged
so
vigorously
and
which
was
adopted
quite
clearly
by
the
district
court
and
a
little
more
equivocally,
i
think,
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
gone
ahead
to
further
bernstein
letter
exception.
and,
that
is
that,
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
a
--
an
exception
exists
wherever
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
acts
of
a
foreign
state
were
in
violation
of
international
law
and
the
court
is
then
free
to
check
at
least
that
much
and
to
investigate
international
law
for
itself.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that,
for
the
court
to
examine
into
a
foreign
act
of
state
on
those
grounds,
could
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
and,
indeed,
both
of
the
courts
below
acknowledged
this
because
both
of
them
give
emphasis
to
the
fact
that,
in
this
case,
it
could
not.
the
district
court,
because
they
said
that
the
foreign
state
had
already
said
this
was
in
violation
of
international
law
so,
therefore,
it
couldn't
defend
the
cubans
anymore
than
they
were
already
offended
and,
the
court
of
appeals,
because
it
said
we
have
a
bernstein
letter
coupled
with
the
other.
so,
both
courts
below,
at
least
accept
the
fact
that
this
court
interfere
with
--
with
the
foreign
relations.
now,
why
is
this
true?
well,
one
thing
that's
true
about
it
is,
because
the
--
this
kind
of
pronouncement
can
become
a
problem
of
time,
as
far
as
the
department
of
state
is
concerned,
they
have
other
fish
to
fry
than
this
particular
expropriation
or
this
particular
act.
and,
it
may
be
that
the
timing
of
a
protest
is
important
to
them,
whereas,
the
timing
of
a
judicial
pronouncement
could
not
take
into
account
the
same
factors.
and,
there
is
the
problem
of
phrasing
it.
if,
after
all,
the
effort
here
is
it
to
--
is
to
get
compensation
for
the
people
involved
whose
property
has
been
taken,
if
it
is
to
resolve
those
relations
so
the
future
foreign
freight
can
go
on,
the
very
serious
problems
of
phrasing
of
a
protest
can
come
up,
can
exist.
for
example,
if
the
protest
that
you
made,
the
reasons
why
it
was
in
violation
of
law,
were
phrased
in
one
way,
you
might
be
able
to
secure
similar
notes
from
other
governments
which
did
not
agree
with
everything
that
you
felt
was
true
of
international
law,
then
this
situation
would
agree
with
some
of
them
and
it
might
be
the
better
part
of
wisdom
to
give
emphasis
to
those
points
so
as
to
secure
similar
protests
from
other
governments.
and,
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
the
problem
here
of
--
as
a
problem
of
phrasing
in
an
area
of
developing
a
law
which
isn't
entirely
clear.
what
international
law
is,
with
respect
to
its
appropriations
is,
i
assure
this
court,
not
a
crystal
clear
proposition,
however
clear
it
may
be
on
these
facts.
and,
different
states
do
have
different
views
on
this
matter.
for
the
courts
of
this
country
to
pronounce,
with
respect
to
what
international
law
presently
is,
in
their
view,
in
this
area
is,
i
think,
seriously
to
affect
the
conduct
of
our
foreign
policy
for
this
reason.
the
department
of
state
is,
of
course,
when
it
invokes
international
law
in
these
situations,
playing
the
role
of
an
advocate
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
the
united
states
would
like
international
law
to
be
within
this
area
because
we
would
like
to
a
have
international
law
which
would,
in
our
judgment,
protect
foreign
investment
which
would
encourage
development,
which
would
create
a
climate
of
investment
of
that
kind.
now,
already,
in
this
case,
by
the
expressions
of
doubt
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether,
for
example,
compensation
was
really
required,
already,
the
negotiating
position
of
the
department
of
state,
in
this
respect,
to
position
it
as
an
advocate,
as
urging
in
an
external
arena,
is
already,
to
an
extent,
hurt
by
the
pronouncement
here
by
the
court
below
as
to
how
it
looked
at
international
law
because,
now,
every
time
that
the
department
of
state
is
to
urge
a
position
with
respect
to
expropriation,
it
is
going
to
have
that
opinion
and,
should
this
court
reverse
the
prior
precedent
or
modify
it,
it's
going
to
have
every
opinion
by
every
court
state
and
federal
in
the
united
states,
by
50
state
jurisdictions,
by
a
number
of
federal
jurisdictions.
it's
going
to
have
to
cope
with
all
those
expressions
of
what
international
law
is.
is
this
really
--
i
would
this
court,
is
this
really
the
way
in
which
international
law
can
develop?
isn't
--
in
this
development,
don't
we
have
certain
policy
values
that
we
wish
to
promote
and
aren't
these
better
promoted
in
an
external
arena
than
by
the
pronouncement
of
courts
sitting
in
this
country,
pronouncements
which
have
to
be
and
should
be
and
properly
should
be
objective
decisions,
objective
views
as
to
what
international
law
is
when,
really,
your
arguing
what
it
is
as
a
policy
argument
in
hope
that
it
will
become
that
or
something
approximately
like
it?
but,
really,
is
what
the
department
of
state
is
doing,
attempting
to
get
others
to
take
their
views,
it
seems
to
me
that
rather
than
promote
international
law,
judicial
decisions
of
this
kind
would
really
be
a
deadening
weight
upon
its
development
and,
at
least
upon
its
developments
in
lines
which
i
think
that
--
we
would
wish
to
do.
and,
if
they
follow
the
department
of
state
in
their
pronouncements,
then
all
they
would
have
done
would
have
been
to
impugn
their
own
reputation
for
objectivity
in
courts
abroad
and
the
decisions
would
be
reviewed
not
as
good
decisions
with
respect
to
international
law,
but
merely
as
the
expression
of
parochial
and
nationalistic
views.
the
second
major
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
this
is
not
a
deterrent
to
foreign
expropriations.
if
indeed
the
--
all
of
the
powers
given
to
the
executive
branch
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
if
we
can
freeze
all
the
funds,
if
we
can
cut
off
all
aid
and
assistance,
if
we
can
prevent
the
importation
of
any
of
the
property,
if
we
can
exercise
all
of
our
not
inconsiderable
persuasive
powers
around
the
world
in
this
respect
it
--
and
this
does
not
deter
the
foreign
government
from
a
violation
of
international
law
with
respect
to
the
seizure
of
property,
why
on
earth
is
a
decision
by
the
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
going
to
have
that
momentous
effect
upon
a
foreign
government?
in
fact
that
the
courts
in
the
united
states
been
widely
separated
incidental,
not
very
frequent
occasions,
would
declare
it
to
be
in
violation
of
international
law,
as
to
act
as
a
deterrent?
i'm
simply
unpersuaded.
and,
i'd
like
to
add
to
the
final
point,
this
court
to
think
very
seriously,
what
it
would
be
doing
because
i
think
it
would
be
opening
the
doors
of
this
court
to
a
flood
of
litigation,
and
let
me
suggest
at
least
one
way
in
which
this
might
be
true.
at
the
present
moment
under
the
law,
this
court
and
others
courts
of
the
united
states
will
examine
foreign
judgments
which
are
unexecuted
on
certain
limited
grounds.
and,
normally,
we
get
a
summary
judgment
using
that
foreign
judgment
to
support
it,
but
no
court
in
the
united
states
has
ever
looked
behind
an
executed
foreign
judgment,
a
foreign
judgment
into
which
a
--
which
a
foreign
court
said
a
owes
b
so
much
money
besides
that,
and
then
a
pays
b
that
money.
now,
do
you
--
that
would
be,
it
seems
to
me,
perfectly
appropriately
and
has
been
suggested
by
the
commentators
to
be
the
act
of
a
foreign
government,
a
foreign
act
of
state
if,
now,
on
that
judgment,
a
man
is
to
come
into
court,
mr.
b
is
to
co
--
or
mr.
a
is
going
to
come
into
court
and
say
“b
really
owes
me
$25
because
i
didn't
get
an
international
due
process
in
the
trial
of
that
case,
wherever
it
may
have
been.”
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
acts
of
a
foreign
government,
made
effective
within
their
own
territory,
completely
carried
out
within
their
own
territory
are,
nonetheless,
subject
to
reexamination
if
they're
in
violation
of
international
law,
that
you
buy
the
whole
package
when
you
do
it.
you
buy
everything
which
has
been
called
or
claimed
to
be
a
denial
of
justice
under
international
law
when
you
take
that
and
you
open
up
the
doors
of
american
courts
to
review
all
of
the
judgments
of
foreign
courts,
executed
and
unexecuted,
where
a
plaintiff
can
make
an
allegation
that
his
rights,
under
international
law,
had
in
some
way
been
deprived.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
have
in
that
situation
because
the
court
put
some
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that,
here,
there
already
been
a
protest
by
the
state
department.
it
has
been
proposed
by
some
of
the
commentators
and,
i
think,
suggested
in
the
respondent's
briefs
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
only
be
used
where
the
department
of
state
says
that
it
should
be
invoked.
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
quite
obvious
problems.
for
one
thing,
you'd
have
to
review
a
tremendous
number
of
cases
in
the
department
of
state
and,
in
second
place,
the
very
fact
of
saying
use
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
unavoidably
carry
an
implication
that
you
did
think
that
international
law
had
been
violated
by
the
--
by
the
foreign
government
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
because
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well
mr.
--
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
express
my
views
a
little
differently
than
that.
i
think
it
would
perhaps
clarify
them.
i
urge
that
this
court
adopt
--
affirm
what
has
always
been
the
rule
in
this
situation
and,
that
is,
that,
as
a
positive
rule
of
decisions,
conflict
of
laws
and
rules
proscribed
for
reasons
of
foreign
problems,
the
court
will
not
inquire
into
the
acts
of
a
foreign
government
which
are
taken
within
its
own
territory,
and
that
is
not
the
matter
which
the
court
will
inquire
into.
i
would
say
that,
if
that
were
the
rule,
there
would
be
no
reason
at
all
for
the
department
of
state
to
constantly
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
that
rule
since,
i
think,
it
would
be
done
by
counsel.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
possible,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
haven't
taken
--
i
have
taken
no
position
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
that
is
desirable.
if
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
case
could
be
decided
when
it
happen.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it's
not
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
hasn't
really
been
decided
below,
your
honor,
because
the
first
bernstein
case,
judge
hand
gave
a
very
broad
hint
that
the
situation
might,
indeed,
be
different
if
the
department
of
state
waive
this.
and,
the
second
bernstein
case,
such
a
letter
did
appear
and
there
was
a
judgment,
as
i
recollect,
in
the
district
court
and
the
appeal
was
mooted
and
the
case
was
settled.
so,
it
has
never
been
spoken
on
by
any
appellate
court,
except
as
a
suggestion
by
judge
hand
that,
perhaps,
the
situation
would
be
different
if
such
an
informal
letter
came
from
the
department
of
state.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
that
statement
is
obviously
a
very
broad
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
statement.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think,
as
it
has
been
interpreted
and
as
it
has
been
understood,
i
would
--
that
would
be
the
--
our
position
and
not
a
literal
application
perhaps
of
that
language.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct,
justice
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
has
to
be
done
in
the
sense
that
that
doctrine
would
require
that
you
not
--
it
doesn't
--
if
that's
the
result,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
you
don't
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
say
whether
they
do
or
not.
you
say
a
court
will
not
inquire
beyond
that
title.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
what
it
means
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
what
it
means
is
that,
in
the
courts
of
this
country
--
in
the
courts
of
this
country,
that
title
will
not
be
questioned.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but
it
can
be
questioned
in
any
international
tribunal.
it
can
be
questioned
in
any
diplomatic
negotiations.
it
can
be
questioned
by
any
other
branch
of
the
government.
it
simply
cannot
be
questioned
by
courts
within
united
states.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
you
have
to
--
that's
--
i
think
it
would
be
correct
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
to
say
that
you
have
to
decide
it
on
that
basis,
whether
true
or
not.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think,
your
honor,
the
effect
of
saying
“we're
not
going
to
decide”
would
in
almost
all
cases
have
the
effect
of
treating
that
title
that
was
vested
through
this
act
of
state
as
being
a
good
title.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
because,
normally,
this
is
the
person
that
has
possession.
now,
concretely
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
that's
correct
but
this
case
is
unique
and,
to
make
this
doctrine
--
let
me
repeat
it.
to
make
this
doctrine
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
get
possession
of
some
negotiable
papers
for
inspection
or
for
whatever
the
purpose
was,
and
that's
what
it's
turning
on,
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
proper
basis
for
decision.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
--
that's
--
that's
correct
your
honor,
unless
there
is
a
bernstein
exception,
which
i
have
not
urged
upon
this
court
and
which
i
have
said
could
remain
for
the
case
where
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
first
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
know.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
don't
think
that
follows,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
think
that
follows
at
all
because
i'm
not
suggesting
that
these
cuban
decrees
can
be
or
should
be
enforced
within
these
countries
to
assets
that
the
cuban
government
doesn't
have
and
didn't
take
possession
of
in
cuba.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
cuba,
itself,
that's
right
and
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
so,
i
don't
know
how.
i
don't
know
what.
i
can't
envisage
the
situation
that
you
pose
of
the
cuban
government
going
around
and
collecting
lots
of
things
because
i
would
suppose
that
these
were
things
which
were
not
located
within
cuba
at
the
time
of
this
decree
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
and,
if
located
within
cuba
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
courts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but,
they're
certainly
free
to
question
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
title
anywhere
else.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
from
us,
from
the
united
--
but
it's
not
in
our
possession
when
it's
frozen.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
well,
it's
just
in
the
possession
where
it
is
and
nobody
can
deal
with
it
or
transfer
it
or
use
it
or
anything
else.
they
can
remain
right
in
the
bank.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
think
nobody
can
question
the
cuban
government's
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
title
to
that
money
in
the
courts.
now,
it
may
be
that,
at
subsequent
time,
on
an
arrangement
such
as
all
of
the
arrangement
cited,
i
think,
on
pages
30
to
32
of
our
brief,
then
the
--
justice
white,
they
agree
to
give
up
all
of
these
various
assets
in
this
country
in
return
for
something,
perhaps
providing
more
money.
at
which
point,
you
allocate
it
among
all
of
the
people
who
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
cuban
decree.
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
decree
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
i
suppose,
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
would
not
have
prevailed
here,
he
would
not
prevail
there.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
so
he
could
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
the
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
he
can't.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
but,
he
can't
because
that's
frozen
anyhow.
it
can't
be
transferred.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
can't
be
--
nothing
can
happen
to
it
under
that
license
without
permission
from
the
treasury
--
i
mean
--
under
the
regulation.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
literally,
nothing.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it's
a
very
broad
order.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it's
not
a
question,
mr.
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
justice
white.
it's
questioning
the
title
of
the
cuban
government.
in
this
instance,
what
would
be
there
would
not
be
the
title
of
the
cuban
government,
it
would
be
the
ability
of
the
--
of
the
cuban
government
or
of
anybody
else
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
these
transferred
funds.
we
wouldn't
have
to
question
their
title
in
order
to
say,
under
the
treasury
regulations,
pursuant
to
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
this
simply
can't
be
dealt
with.
and,
in
fact,
the
easy
answer
to
your
question
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
(voice
overlap)
as
you
can't
even
have
a
judgment.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
can't
even
get
a
judgment
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
without
permission.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
right.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
it
has
this
much
to
do
if
they
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
--
justice
black,
it
shows
that
this
can
be
dealt
with
effectively.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
by
the
executive
--
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
in
so
far
as
the
courts
of
this
country
are
concerned,
that
will
be
the
property
of
cuba.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
we
would
deal
with
it
as
such,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
deb.
katzenbach
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
although
it's
difficult
for
a
man
to
conceive
a
broader
act
than
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
