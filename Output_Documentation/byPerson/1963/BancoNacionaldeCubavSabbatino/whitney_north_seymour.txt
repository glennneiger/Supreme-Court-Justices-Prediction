mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
only
a
couple
of
minutes,
i
will,
first,
say
a
word
about
the
motion
for
substitution.
there
is,
pending
before
the
court,
a
motion
by
c.a.v.,
my
client,
to
be
substituted
for
sabbatino,
the
discharged
state
court
receiver.
sabbatino
was
appointed
in
1960
as
the
state
court
receiver
of
the
assets
of
c.a.v.
he
received
the
funds
which
is
in
question
here.
at
the
end
of
1962,
he
was
discharged
as
state
court
receiver
and
that
fund
was
placed
in
escrow
abiding
the
event
of
this
suit.
therefore,
sabbatino
has
no
further
interest
in
the
litigation.
mr.
williams
filed
as
an
indemnity,
which
is
reflected
in
the
record,
and
c.a.v.
is
the
only
party
really
in
a
position
to
assert
an
economic
interest
in
the
fund
and,
under
the
general
power
of
the
court
to
grant
substitutions
in
such
cases,
we
would
hope
that
the
court
would
do
it.
the
only
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
these
were
an
application
on
this
rule
24
(c),
which
it
isn't,
and
if
it
were
made
in
a
different
court,
which
it's
not,
there
would
be
problems
but
it
isn't
that
kind
of
an
application.
it
isn't
made
in
a
court
to
which
the
rules
apply
and,
therefore,
we
would
your
honors
would
grant
the
relief.
now,
on
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
proposition,
first,
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
ought
not
to
be
applied
where
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
international
law,
and
i
recognize
that
there
are
dicta,
which
i
shall
have
to
work
my
way
around,
which
would
be
interposed
to
such
a
proposition.
but,
those
dicta
originated
at
a
period
when
international
law
did
not
bulk
as
large
in
the
views
of
the
american
government
or
the
people
of
the
world
or
the
lawyers
or
judges
of
the
world
as
they
do
now,
and
i
would
hope
that
international
law
now
occupied
a
place
where
weighing
the
complications,
some
of
which,
i
think
are
rather
exaggerated,
suggested
by
my
distinguished
friend,
the
deputy
attorney
general,
against
the
importance
of
building
support
for
international
law,
case
by
case,
by
courts
like
the
united
states
courts
that
are
followed
all
over
the
world,
is
far
more
important.
and,
i
shall
address
myself,
first,
to
that
tomorrow,
and
then,
at
the
end,
i
shall
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
public
policy
of
new
york
which
is
involved
here
because
this
is
a
diversity
case
and,
although
the
district
court
didn't
seem
to
take
the
point,
there
is
a
strong
point
on
the
public
policy
of
new
york
which
i'd
like
to
present
to
the
court.
but,
my
main
emphasis
will
be
on
the
international
law
point,
that
i
think
the
significance
of
that
point
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
your
honors
have
before
you
briefs
presented
with
great
spirit
and
earnestness
on
behalf
of
the
association
of
the
bar,
and
the
american
bar
association,
and
the
international
law
association,
and
the
dean
of
the
american
bar,
mr.
john
lord
o'brian,
and
his
partner.
and,
these
all
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
international
law
aspect
of
this
and,
weighing
that
against
what
is
admitted
to
be
a
judge-made
rule
which
the
court
can
administer
as
it
thinks
wisest
in
the
long-range
interest
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
judicial
administration
of
the
united
states,
these
indicate
that
international
law
should
give
--
be
given
great
weight
in
the
balance.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
argue
today
that
the
judgment
below
was
right
because
the
confiscatory
decree
of
cuba
was
plainly
a
violation
of
international
law
and
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
violations
of
international
law
and
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
violations
of
international
law.
and,
second,
i
will
argue
that
the
confiscatory
decree
which
was
sought
to
be
enforced
in
new
york,
to
some
extent,
violated
new
york
public
policy
and
that
the
judgment
is
correct
on
that
ground
as
well.
and,
first,
i
must
follow
some
beaten
past
but
i'll
follow
those
very
fast.
of
course
i
don't
need
to
argue
that,
since
the
constitution
was
adopted,
international
law
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
stated
eloquently
in
the
paquete
habana
and
lola
and
in
the
eel
case
and
many
other
cases.
and,
the
law
of
the
land
is
no
more
obscure
in
the
international
law
field
than
in
any
other
field.
the
importance
of
upholding
international
law
was
certainly
never
more
important
than
it
is
today.
the
movements
with
which
your
honors
are
familiar,
the
international
commission
of
jurists,
the
world
peace
through
law
movement,
both
recognized
the
great
importance
of
establishing
and
maintaining
the
rule
of
law
including
the
rule
of
international
law.
mr.
rabinowitz,
yesterday,
suggested
that
there
were
a
lot
of
new
countries
in
asia
and
africa
who
would
think
that
if
the
american
courts
adhere
to
international
law
and
enforced
it
in
connection
with
the
acts
of
foreign
states
that
they
would
be
thought
to
be
pursuing
a
local
policy,
but
international
law
is
not
of
that
character.
the
great
meetings
of
lawyers
around
the
world
in
asia
and
africa,
many
of
the
lawyers
from
these
new
countries
have
shown
their
adherence
and
devotion
to
these
same
principles.
at
page
42
and
43
of
our
brief,
we
quote
in
part
from
the
declaration
adopted
at
the
final
conference
in
athens
which
the
chief
justice
attended
and
which
declare
the
devotion
of
the
lawyers
of
the
world
to
the
cause
of
the
rule
of
law
and
to
international
law.
and
that
devotion
was
never
more
eloquently
stated,
i
think,
by
the
solicitor
general
here,
a
day
before
yesterday,
in
the
barnett
case.
so,
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
the
internation
law
is
a
part
of
our
law,
and
then
i
want
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
question
of
whether
the
cuban
action
didn't
clearly
violate
international
law.
and,
here,
the
deputy
attorney
general
very
properly
conceded
that
it
did.
the
united
states
had
taken
the
position
that
it
did.
the
courts
below
were
clearly
correct
in
concluding
that
it
did.
the
cuban
decree
was,
on
its
face,
adopted
in
retaliation
against
the
action
in
reducing
the
cuban
sugar
quota.
it
was
aimed
squarely
at
american
interest
on
its
face.
it
was,
thus,
retaliatory
and
discriminatory
and,
on
those
grounds,
violated
international
law.
but,
it
also
represented
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
aliens
without
compensation
and,
on
that
ground
as
well,
was
a
violation
of
international
law.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
on
that
ground
alone,
mr.
justice,
in
my
view,
we
do
not
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
have
to
attempt
to
reconstruct
that
meeting,
and
i
have
referred
to
it
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
on
page
42.
mr.
rabinowitz's
proof,
i
think,
incorrectly
describes
the
action
at
athens
as
one
where
there
was
grave
dissension
on
this
point.
i
think
the
fact
was
that
there
was
a
resolution
adopted
toward
the
close
of
the
meeting,
and
then
some
of
the
representatives
or
some
of
the
newer
countries
thought
that
the
american
had
unduly
dominated
the
deliberations
and
asked
that
this
matter
be
put
over
for
a
study
by
the
world
law
center,
which
was
to
be
created
afterwards.
but,
this
came
almost
on
the
heels
of
the
almost
unanimous
determination
by
the
un
that
confiscation
without
reasonable
compensation
was
a
violation
of
international
law
and
i
don't
think
the
athens
action
can
fairly
be
regarded
as
casting
any
doubt
on
that
question.
now,
let
me
just
touch
on
the
nature
of
this
confiscation
without
compensation
so
that
there
won't
be
any
doubt
that
the
courts
below
were
quite
right
in
re
--
in
regarding
the
--
the
provision
for
compensation
which
was
suggested
in
a
kind
of
a
casual
way
in
argument
as
being
real
compensation.
it
was
provided,
in
effect,
that
those
whose
property
was
con
--
was
confiscated
might
be
compensated
in
the
form
of
30-year-cuban
bonds
to
be
issued
after
appraisal
of
the
value
of
the
property
by
cuban
appraisers.
and,
these
bonds
were
to
be
taken
care
of
out
a
sinking
fund,
the
payments
into
which
were
entirely
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
cuban
authorities,
and
the
sinking
fund
was
to
be
made
up
in
this
fashion
25%
of
the
amounts
received
for
cuba
sold
to
the
united
states
were
to
be
deposited
in
that
sinking
fund
over
a
period
of
years,
but
only
25%
of
the
sales
to
the
united
states
over
3
million
european
long
tons
at
a
price
higher
than
had
ever
been
paid
for
a
cuban
sugar
in
the
10
years
before
the
decree.
and,
in
only
one
year,
had
as
much
as
3
million
long
tons
been
sold
to
the
united
states.so,
it's
perfectly
evident
that
this
was
an
illusory
provision
and
made
no
provision
for
compensation
in
effect.
now,
my
learned
friend,
mr.
rabinowitz,
in
his
reply
brief,
quotes
from
a
television
interview
with
mr.
castro
in
which
he
says
he
might
be
willing
to
negotiate
with
americans
on
proper
terms,
a
--
an
interview
three
years
after
the
event,
surely,
no
possible
support
for
their
view
that
this
was
prompt
and
adequate
compensation.
and
so,
we
have
a
decree
which
was
confiscatory,
retaliatory,
and
discriminatory
and
it's
settled
by
repeated
declarations
of
the
authorities
to
which
the
court
looks
for
international
law
that
such
decrees
violate
international
law.
now,
the
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals
had,
or
at
least
expressed,
in
trying
to
break
down
the
decree
is
one
that
need
not
concern
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
at
all.
it's
evident
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
this
decree
to
violate
international
law.
it
was
a
little
in
doubt
whether
a
decree
which
merely
confiscated
would
violate
international
law
if
adequate
compensation
or
if
some
compensation
were
provided.
in
the
first
place,
we're
not
dealing
with
such
a
decree.
in
the
second
place,
my
learned
friend
suggested
yesterday,
the
deputy
attorney
general,
that
one
of
the
concerns
about
--
of
the
government
about
our
contention
here
was
that
maybe
a
court
would
sometimes
make
an
error
about
international
law,
and
i
submit
that
an
error
of
a
lower
court
is
to
be
corrected
here,
if
there
was
any
error
in
connection
with
its
conception
of
international
law,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it's
conceivable
but
it's
sufficiently
rare,
so
that
i
think
we
would
all
chance
it.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
know
it's
been
suggested
that
international
law
is
so
delicate
a
plan
that
it
should
not
be
subjected
to
scrutiny
except
by
those
in
the
state
department.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
usual
rule
was
that
the
--
in
a
diversity
suit,
one
would
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
or
the
forum,
but
the
general
principle
which
has
been
followed
in
the
federal
courts,
in
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
has
been
followed
in
various
cases
in
the
federal
courts,
and
the
state
of
new
york
follows
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
too.
and,
therefore,
there
isn't
any
substantial
difference
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
forum
and
in
the
federal
rule.
now,
let
me
just
go
back
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
mean
to
pass
over
to
your
question
at
all,
but
i
think
the
law
of
new
york
and
the
federal
rule
would
be
the
same
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
examination
of
questions
of
international
law
by
a
federal
court
or
a
state
court
is
any
more
difficult
than
the
examination
of
lots
of
other
question
that
they
have
to
examine.
some
questions
which
affect
the
life
and
liberties
of
the
people
and
the
appellate
courts
sit
to
review
those
questions
and,
on
the
whole,
keep
the
lower
courts
from
committing
egregious
errors,
and
i'm
going
to
come
a
little
later
on
to
the
question
of
whether
that
concern
expressed
by
the
deputy
attorney
general
ought
to
keep
the
court
from
applying
the
law
of
the
land
in
act
of
state
cases.
i
don't
want
to
get
ahead
of
myself
on
that
if
i
could
--
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me
a
moment
more.
now,
here,
we
have
not
a
question
of
the
security
of
titles
but
an
action
by
the
cuban
government
to
enforce,
in
effect,
the
cuban
decree,
get
the
avails
of
the
effect
of
the
cuman
--
cuban
decree,
and
then
use
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
shield
its
activity
so
that
no
inquiry
can
be
made
by
the
court
about
the
nature
of
the
decree
and
its
violation
of
international
law.
and,
i
submit
that
no
authority
requires
this
court
to
permit
such
an
action
without
that
inquiry
and,
indeed,
what
the
cuban
government
seeks
here
is
very
much
like
what
the
chinese
government
sought
in
the
national
city
bank
case.
it
seeks
to
use
our
law
by
any
other
litigant
but
it
wants
our
law
free
from
the
claims
of
justice,
and
i
submit
that
that
principle
which
was
there
applied
in
connection
with
the
question
of
a
counterclaim
is
equally
applicable
where
the
foreign
government
is,
in
effect,
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
briefs
here
examine
the
authorities,
our
brief
and
briefs
of
amicae,
beginning
with
underhill
and
going
through
the
shapleigh
case,
and
they
undertake
to
try
to
satisfy
the
court
that
those
cases
really
didn't
decide
this
question.
that
underhill,
at
least,
is
really
a
sovereign
immunity
case
despite
the
breath
of
some
of
the
language
in
the
opinion
that
the
other
cases
did
not
involve
violations
of
international
law
because
they
involve,
in
the
case
of
oetjen,
a
mexican
citizen,
and
in
the
case
of
ricaud,
an
action
of
a
revolutionary
force
which
might
very
well
be
regarded
as
not
a
violation
of
international
law,
and
i'm
going
to
--
instead
of
taking
your
honors'
time
with
the
review
of
those
cases
in
detail,
i'd
like
to
rest
on
the
briefs
on
that
proposition.
i
say
they
do
not
control
the
decision
here.
they
do
not
require
the
court
to
say
that,
where
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law,
the
courts
of
the
united
states
will
not
review
that
violation
because
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
any
dicta
which
may
be
thought
to
go
beyond
that
could
be
appropriately
limited.
your
honors,
in
baker
against
carr,
certainly,
limited
the
sweeping
language
of
oetjen
to
the
extent
that
it
suggest
that
all
foreign
relations
matters
were
beyond
judicial
competency
because
they
were
political
questions
and
i
see
no
reason
why,
if
there
is
anything
in
underhill
or
the
other
cases
that
requires
limitation,
the
court
cannot
--
can't
do
it.
those
cases
were
all
decided
before
the
present
development
of
international
law
had
reached
anything
like
its
present
state
or
before
the
countries
of
the
world
was
concerned
with
it
as
they
are
or
before
the
international
agencies
like
the
un
and
the
world
court
were
in
existence.
and,
i
submit
that,
today,
the
concept
of
international
law,
the
importance
of
international
law
justifies
a
fresh
look
at
those
questions.
now,
there's
one
case
that
my
friend
mr.
rabinowitz
referred
to
that
i
don't
want
to
wholly
omit
reference
to
and
that
was
the
bahia
case
in
which,
right
after
an
american
had
hijacked
an
american
plane
which
was
returned
by
the
cuban
government,
a
cuban
hijacked
a
cuban
freighter
and
it
was
kept
in
the
custody
of
the
coastguard
off
of
norfolk.
it
kept
it
so
in
their
custody
that
the
us
marshall
from
the
district
court
was
not
allowed
to
border
and
file
s
--
and
file
a
libel.
a
suggestion
of
sovereign
immunity
was
filed
by
the
state
department
and
there
was,
pretty
clearly,
an
executive
understanding
that,
in
view
of
the
return
of
the
hijacked
airliner,
the
hijacked
ship
would
be
allowed
to
proceed.
and,
in
that
case,
in
opposing
a
stay
that
the
government
cited
here,
the
underhill
case
and
the
cour
--
and
the
chief
justice,
in
his
memorandum
denying
a
stay,
referred
to
the
underhill
case.
and,
i
think
they're
perhaps
quite
appropriately
because
there
was
a
sovereign
immunity
case
basically
and
the
case
in
which,
in
effect,
the
executive
department
had
undertaken
to
deal
with
this
matter
and,
no
doubt,
the
courts
would
give
effect
to
executive
agreements
as
they
did
in
pink,
in
belmont,
and
many
other
cases
and
i
think
this
was,
in
substance,
a
case
of
that
kind.
now,
we
don't
need
to
argue
any
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
it
was
treated
as
a
cuban
vessel,
yes.
it
had
been
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
my
impression
is
that
it
had
been
--
that
it
was
owned
by
the
cuban
government.
the
claim
was
principally
by
the
united
fruit
company.
they're
part
of
its
cargo
which
was
this
sugar.
but,
in
any
event,
it
was
treated
--
the
state
department,
through
the
attorney
general,
filed
a
suggestion
of
immunity.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and,
on
that
basis,
the
ship
was
ultimately
released.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
their
issue
was
act
of
state
but
it
was
a
sovereign
immunity
case,
and
i
think
that
cannot
be
overlooked
in
trying
to
interpret
the
case.
the
act
of
state
argument
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
united
fruit
company
and,
yet,
here
was
a
--
here
was
an
emergency
situation
in
which
a
hijacked
airliner
had
just
been
returned.
here
was
a
hijacked
ship
and
with
a
very
difficult
case,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
made
battle
or
not,
but
it
was
a
very
difficult
case.
but,
it
was
within
the
area,
i
submit,
of
executive
understanding
or
agreement.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
it
doesn't
suggest
that
to
me.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
and
there
may
be
some
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
there
may
be
some
litvinov
agreements.
and
when
there
are
litvinov
agreements
and
when
there
are
understandings
about
hijacked
planes,
then
i
suppose
the
courts
will
respect
them
but,
in
the
mean
time,
the
law
of
the
land,
the
international
law,
is
being
obtruded
through
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
every
case,
and
i
s
--
i
want
to
come
to
this
point
in
a
little
more
general
way
in
a
moment.
i
don't
mean
to
try
to
winso
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
winsome
away
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
--
from
the
question.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
the
rule
of
international
law
is
just
and
prompt
compensation
for
expropriated
property
and
then,
when
you
get
less
than
full
compensation,
there
must
be
a
point
at
which
it's
illusory
as
it
was
here,
and
that
violates
international
law.
now,
i'm
not
--
i
no
--
don't
have
to
argue
because
of
my
friend's
concession
yesterday
in
the
colloquy
with
the
court
that
this
is
a
constitutional
matter,
that
there's
any
constitutional
inhibition
on
the
courts
requiring
that
they
defer
to
the
executive
all
the
time
in
this
matter
because
it's
clear
that
it
isn't
full
of
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes?
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
would
have
to
rely
on
your
ingenuity
to
discover
that.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
suppose
it
would
be
argued
by
those
who
try
to
bring
the
case
here
that,
somehow,
the
separation
of
powers,
while
not
a
constitutional
matter,
was
so
established
that
there
was
a
basic
question
of
federal
policy
involved.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
deal
with
that
as
i
go
along
and
if
don't
deal
with
it
to
your
honor's
satisfaction,
i
will
try
to
come
back
to
it.
well,
now,
i
want
to
pass,
if
i
may,
to
an
attempt
to
deal
with
mr.
katzenbach's
policy
argument,
and
i'll
hope
to
pick
up
some
of
the
answers
to
some
of
the
questions
that
i've
deferred
there.
with
the
greatest
respect
to
the
--
to
the
government,
to
government
counsel
and
to
those
who
purport
to
speak
for
the
state
department
on
this
matter,
i
submit
that
this
argument
really,
when
your
honors
come
to
consider
it
in
prospective,
exaggerates
the
importance
of
the
executive
as
the
upholder
of
international
law
and
minimizes
too
much
the
role
of
the
courts
as
the
upholder
and
definer
and
enforcer
of
international
law.
that
it,
naturally,
and
i
naturally
expect,
the
executive
department
to
defend
every
possible
prerogative
that
may
exist.
it
naturally
tends
to
suggest
that
it's
only
through
the
declarations
of
the
state
department
about
international
law
that
international
law
can
be
advanced
and
it
doesn't
do
any
good
for
courts
to
make
decisions
about
international
law
or
to
enforce
international
law.
that
they
may
only
just
get
in
the
way
of
the
state
department
in
this
regard
and
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
them
to
continue
the
self-denying
practice
of
the
past
and
just
keep
out
of
this
and
let
the
rogue
elephants
that
may
be
loose
in
the
family
of
nations
and
may
be
violating
international
law
come
into
our
courts
and
enforce
their
decrees
and
let
the
state
department
protest.
not
all
was
effective
with
rogue
elephants.
it
would
be
the
one
voice
of
the
united
states
in
support
of
international
law.
now,
i
submit
that
this
view
takes
too
poor
a
view
of
the
contribution
that
could
be
made
by
the
judiciary
in
this
field.
i
think
it
stems
from
a
kind
of
a
mystique
about
foreign
relations,
a
kind
of
a
feeling
that,
in
this
field,
you
have
to
leave
it
to
the
experts
and
i
submit
that,
in
a
day
when
it
is
part
of
defined
and
declared
american
policy
and
has
been
for
a
long
time,
not
a
policy
of
the
moment
but
a
policy
of
the
united
states
that
international
law
is
to
be
upheld,
that
the
rule
of
law
is
to
be
upheld,
that
it's
too
important
a
matter
to
be
left
solely
to
non-lawyers
and
that
courts
and
lawyers
can
make
some
contribution
to
it.
now,
i'm
going
to
just
go
over
it
quickly
because
my
time
is
very
short,
some
of
the
main
points
that
were
made
by
mr.
katzenbach
in
this
field
because
many
others
will
occur
to
your
honors
if
you
come
to
think
about
this.
and,
first,
let
me
lay
aside
one
suggestion
that
mr.
rabinowitz
makes
in
his
reply
brief.
he
says
that
when
the
lawyers,
the
amicae
curae,
and
the
others,
undertake
--
try
to
deal
with
these
policy
questions,
they
are
confusing
themselves
with
judges
of
this
court
and
with
the
secretary
of
state.
i
hope
we're
not
committing
that
transgression.
i
would've
supposed
that
on
argument
as
to
the
proper
role
of
the
various
divisions
of
the
government
was
open
as
a
natural
part
of
the
advocacy
in
the
case.
now,
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief,
and
mr.
katzenbach
may
have
alighted
some
of
these
points
yesterday.
first,
it
suggested
that
the
courts
ought
not
to
concern
themselves
with
violations
of
international
law
in
this
field
but
simply
let
the
act
of
state
doctrine
operate
to
let
confiscatory
decrees
have
their
way
in
the
united
states
because
you
can't
establish
a
world
rule
of
law
by
occasional
judicial
decisions.
well,
of
course
that's
true,
but
every
brick
in
the
wall
of
international
law
placed
there
by
an
authoritative
court
respected
around
the
world
is
better
than
another
hole
in
the
wall
which
is
created
when
a
confiscatory
decree
in
violation
of
international
law
is
permitted
to
have
its
way.
it
suggested
that
if
the
court
looks
at
international
law
in
connection
with
such
a
decree,
it
may
cast
out
upon
international
titles
and
i
submit
that,
first,
we
don't
have
any
such
problem
here
because
this
isn't
a
question
of
a
third
party
title.
we
don't
the
problem
of
what
you
do
about
purchases,
with
or
without
notice,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but,
i
don't
really
see
why
it
should
be
clear
that
the
united
states
could
be
--
should
become
the
natural
thieves
market
for
the
sale
of
goods
confiscated
in
violation
of
international
law
around
the
world
and
why
this
should
be
one
of
the
countries
where
the
courts
feel
that
they
must
not
interfere
with
titles
so
obtained.
now,
it
suggested
that,
somehow,
cuba
would
react
adversely,
cuba
and
other
countries
similarly
situated
to
a
decision
of
an
american
court
that
they
were
in
violation
of
international
law,
whereas,
they
would
naturally
acquiesce
gracefully
in
any
claim
on
behalf
of
the
state
department
to
that
effect.
i
submit
just
the
opposite
is
the
case.
as
mr.
rabinowitz
never
more
clearly
shown
--
showed
than
he
did
in
his
statement
to
the
court
yesterday
that,
of
course,
the
state
department
could
say
anything
they
wanted
to
about
international
law.
that
didn't
make
any
difference,
but
courts
shouldn't
do
it.
it's
just
this
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
to
your
honors.
when
courts
deliberately
declare
that
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
family
of
nations
has
been
violated
by
this
decree,
the
impact
of
that
action
is
not
only
on
the
country
involved
but
on
the
rest
of
the
judges
and
lawyers
of
the
world.
and,
i
submit
that
the
court
should
not
downgrade
its
contribution
in
this
field
or
assume
that
it's
only
the
executive
department's
declarations
that
will
be
given
weight.
now,
it
suggested
that
this
might
interfere
somehow
with
diplomacy.
i
submit
that
that's
a
much
exaggerated
claim.
i
suppose
there
are
two
possible
sets
of
facts.
you
can
imagine
any
--
any
number.
there
is
one
set
of
facts
in
which
the
court
decides
if
there's
a
violation
of
international
law
and
the
state
department
is
in
negotiations
with
the
country
to
try
to
work
out
arrangements
on
the
basis
that
the
country
has
violated
international
law.
now,
in
such
a
situation,
how
can
a
declaration
by
a
court
possibly
adversely
affect
those
negotiations?
and,
if
you
assume
the
opposite
that
a
court
decide
there
has
been
no
violation
of
internal
law,
isn't
it
perfectly
plain
that
if
the
state
department
has
taken
another
view
since
international
law
and
whether
or
not
it's
been
violated
is
a
matter
that
scholars
and
lawyers
generally
can
determine,
that
they'll
see
through
at
once
the
claim
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
international
law?
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
courts
ought
to
take
up
the
diplomatic
post.
i'm
suggesting
that,
as
they
contrid
--
contribute
the
bricks
to
the
wall
of
international
law,
they
parallel
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
activities
of
the
executive
department.
and,
any
concern
to
the
contrary
is
simply
an
excessive
confidence
in
the
activities
of
non-lawyers
and
an
excessive
doubt
about
the
contributions
of
judges
and
lawyers
to
this
field.
now,
one
final
thing,
mr.
katzenback
said
yesterday
that
if
you
--
if
you
took
this
view,
the
courts
would
be
involved
in
reexamining
foreign
judgments
on
the
ground
that
they
might
involve
violations
of
foreign
law
--
of
international
law.
well,
my
understanding
of
the
rule
is
that
the
court
now
examines
foreign
judgments
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
for
fraud,
perhaps
for
lack
of
procedural
due
process.
surely,
the
fact
that
a
principle
of
american
law,
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land,
gave
an
additional
subject
on
which
foreign
judgments
might
exam
--
be
examined
would
not
unduly
burden
the
courts.
and,
i
submit,
taking
this
in
its
most
authoritative
form,
this
really
expresses
an
exaggerated
concern
and
that
the
courts,
by
passing
on
these
cases
as
they
arrive
--
arise,
applying
international
law
to
the
applause
and
enthusiasm
of
the
countries
of
the
world
who
live
by
international
law,
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
american
courts
are
the
guiding
lights
for
most
of
the
new
countries
who
are
trying
to
work
out
the
principles
of
their
law
and,
to
have
our
courts
showing
their
devotion
to
international
law
rather
than
their
willingness
to
wink
at
violations
of
international
because
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
be
useful.
and,
i
do
not
see
the
possibility
that,
occasionally,
a
lower
court
decision
might
need
correction
should
stand
in
the
way
in
--
to
any
degree.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
if
--
maybe
i
can
dispose
of
this
whole
point
right
now.
i
was
going
to
mention
it
in
a
moment.
the
incorporation
of
c.a.v.
in
cuba
with
90%
of
its
stockholders
--
american
stockholders
would
put
it
in
the
category
where,
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
based
upon
the
views
of
commentators
and
many
of
these
things
before
your
honor,
the
question
of
violation
of
international
law
would
be
considered
and
would
be
involved,
and
i
submit
the
fact
that
cuba
picked
it
out
for
confiscatory,
discriminatory,
retaliatory
attention
shows
that
it
would
be
in
the
position
to
raise
the
question.
now,
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
it's
a
cuban
national
under
those
circumstances
would
stand
in
the
way
of
consideration
of
its
claim
of
violation
of
international
law
and
so
the
lower
courts
upheld.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
your
honor
will
see
in
our
brief
extremely
respectable
authority
for
that
decision,
and
any
contention
to
the
contrary
just
disregards
the
estoppel
which
is
really
worked
by
this
decree.
and,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
further
because
i
think
the
decree
itself
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
proper
disposition
of
the
matter
if
the
court
felt
that
it
could
not
consider
the
international
law
issue
and
i
think,
since
the
international
law
issue
is
a
critical
factor
here,
that
the
court
should
dismiss
the
case
and
the
net
result
of
that
might
be
dubious
under
the
escrow
agreement,
but
that's
something
the
parties
would
just
have
to
figure
out
for
themselves.
but,
the
argument
that
mr.
laylin
makes
in
his
brief
amicus
and
mr.
brown
make
that,
where
the
court
is
unable
to
consider
all
issues,
the
court
shouldn't
consider
part
of
it
and
dispose
of
it
on
that
basis.
it
seems
to
me,
they
have
a
good
deal
of
american.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
is
an
affirmance.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
if
your
honors
do
not
affirm
then
there
are
two
possible
dispositions
that
would
be
proper
in
my
view.
one
would
be
to
remand
to
the
lower
court
to
try
the
issues
which
are
raised
as
to
when
the
cuban
decree
became
effective,
when
title
passed,
if
it
passed,
and
so
on.
and,
the
other
disposition,
which
is
the
one
rather
intimated
in
mr.
justice
clark's
question,
would
be
the
direct
dismissal
upon
the
ground
that,
since
the
court,
if
your
honors
adhere
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
teeth
of
a
violation
of
international
law,
upon
the
ground
that
all
the
issues
can't
be
considered.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes.yes.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
now,
let
me
just
come
to
--
i
just
got
a
couple
of
minutes
more
and
i'm
going
to
hurry
over
two
points,
one,
the
so-called
bernstein
letter
question.
in
this
case,
the
state
department
wrote
letters
which,
amicae
thought
in
the
court
below
and
the
court
below
thought,
indicated
that
the
state
department
did
not
object
to
the
court
considering
the
questions
here.
mr.
katzenbach
and
the
government
brief
take
the
view
that
that
is
a
misinterpretation
of
those
letters
and
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
quarrel
with
them,
although
the
letters
seem
to
me
to
go
a
little
beyond
ordinary
amenities.
but,
my
view
of
the
proper
rule
here
is
this.
since
there's
no
constitutional
inhibition
on
the
consideration
of
these
matters
by
the
courts,
the
courts
saw
it
not
as
a
matter
of
course
to
consider
that
they
have
to
ask
the
state
department
before
they
can
consider
cases
or
controversies
which
are
committed
to
them
by
the
constitution.
they're
performing
a
constitutional
function
in
dealing
with
the
case
or
controversy
and
they
ought
to
consider
the
state
department's
views
only
if
a
matter
of
paramount
national
interest
may
be
involved.
i
would
recognize,
although
it's
not
involved
in
this
case,
that
if
there
were
a
situation
where
the
dec
--
the
momentary
decision
by
a
court
jeopardize
the
national
interest
to
the
point
where
everybody
would
recognize
it,
the
court
might
decide
to
defer
briefly
or
at
length
to
the
request
by
the
state
department.
i
think
that's
a
far
different
thing
from
just
saying
“we
won't
move
unless
the
state
department
says
we
can.”
in
the
bernstein
case,
it
said
it
could
because
there
was
no
violation
of
international
law
involved.
and
so,
the
bernstein
case
is
not
in
point
here
at
all
anyhow.
now,
finally,
let
me
come
to
the
new
york
policy
question
and,
mr.
justice
white,
i
hope
this
doesn't
--
i
hope
this
may
answer
your
question.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
new
york's
policy
is
clear,
established
by
cases
on
our
brief,
that
where
a
--
an
expropriation
decree
is
sought
to
be
given
any
effect
in
new
york,
the
new
york
courts
will
not
enforce
it.
a
long
line
of
authorities
established
that
proposition
and
i
think
it's
not
disputable.
now,
in
this
case,
what
happened
was
that
c.a.v.
had
a
contract
with
farr.
the
cuban
government
expropriated.
it
purported
to
expropriate
the
sugar
but,
in
order
to
make
it
effective,
must
have
appropriated
some
interest
under
that
contract.
and
then,
it
proceeded
under
duress
to
force
farr
to
make
a
new
contract
with
a
representative
of
the
cuban
government
and
then
presented
the
documents
pursuant
to
that
new
contract
to
farr
in
new
york
and
demanded
payment.
now,
in
substance
and
effect,
that
was
nothing
but
a
subrogation
to
the
rights
of
c.a.v.
c.a.v.
had
a
claim
with
c
--
with
farr.
the
cuban
government
made
an
identical
contract,
dated
it
back
to
the
same
day
as
in
the
original
contract
showing
that
they
were
simply
trying
to
affect
the
same
rights,
and
then
they
made
the
demand
in
new
york.
now,
to
disregard
the
form
and
consider
the
substance
of
that
transaction
is
a
step
which
i
think
is
quite
consistent
with
judicial
action.
and,
i
think
that
the
substance
of
that
transaction
was
that
cuba
sought
to
reach
into
new
york
to
get
payment.
and,
whether
you
say
that
it
was
direct
or
indirect
doesn't
make
much
difference
because
payment
could
not
be
made
except
by
enforcing
the
shows
in
action
in
new
york,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
these
cases
where
new
york
would
not
enforce
the
foreign
decree
because
the
foreign
decree
sought
to
deal
with
assets
in
new
york,
and
this
was
the
substance
of
that.
now,
section
977
(b)
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act,
under
which
sabbatino
was
appointed
receiver,
was
passed
to
enforce
the
new
york
public
policy,
as
cases
on
our
brief
show.
and,
the
policy
was
against
expropriation
in
decrees
being
made
effective
in
new
york
and
these
assets,
in
the
hands
of
farr,
taken
under
custody
by
the
receiver
were
taken
under
custody
in
connection
with
that
transaction.
finally,
although
no
new
york
case
deals
with
this
directly,
the
policy
of
new
york
against
expropriation
and
against
permitting
extraterritorial
enforcement
of
expropriation
decrees
ought
to
be
plainly
more
strong
in
opposing
the
enforcement
of
a
decree
which
was
retaliatory
against
the
united
states
and
which
is
sought
to
be
enforced
in
the
new
york
courts
when
it
was
adopted
against
the
very
sovereignty
which
is
--
which
has
established
the
courts.
and,
so,
on
broad
grounds
of
new
york
policy,
i
submit
that
this
judgment
might
correctively
be
affirmed.
now,
judge
dimmick
did
not
deal
with
the
policy
question,
rejected
an
argument
about
policy,
but
i
don't
think
he
dealt
with
it
in
these
terms.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
and
--
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
think
the
new
york
policy
would
recognize
an
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
where
extraterritorial
effect
was
sought
to
be
given.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
yes,
they're
--
the
cases
on
our
brief
to
that
effect.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
i
would've
thought
that
the
federal
court
might
very
well
have
dismissed
on
that
ground
but
it
didn't
do
so.
i
want
to
show
you
that
you
can
as
--
affirm
the
gr
--
the
judgment
on
that
ground,
as
well
as
others.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
the
--
let
me
take
it
in
two
steps.
first,
it's
clear
that
the
act
of
state
policy
which
is
followed
by
this
court
is
not
a
part
of
international
law.
it
is
clear
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
an
american
doctrine,
perhaps,
also
followed
in
england
but
not
followed
generally.
therefore,
that
doctrine,
not
being
a
part
of
international
law,
i
doubt
if
new
york
--
in
new
york,
which
must
be
only
a
fragment
of
that
doctrine,
is
a
part
of
international
law.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
well,
you
--
i
would've
supposed
that
the
law
of
the
land
was
international
law
and
if
--
and
that
it
would
probably
override
a
state
policy,
but
that
involves
a
terribly
difficult
and
elaborate
question
which
i
wouldn't
like
to
try
to
deal
with
right
now.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
yes,
sir.
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
although
--
and
it's
also
clear,
however,
that,
in
various
arbitrations
and
other
cases
which
are
cited
on
our
brief
involving
english
interests,
there's
been
an
effect
by
decisions
from
amelioration
of
the
ct
of
state
doctrine
but,
in
the
decided
cases
in
the
courts,
i
think
sagor
is
probably
still
good
law.
