mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
notice
that,
although
the
court
does
supply
quill
pens
to
counsel,
it
does
not
supply
inkwells
as
well.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir.
it's
just
a
reference
to
the
last
case.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
that
court's
affirmance
of
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
district
court
had
entered
an
order
dismissing
the
complaint
on
a
motion
by
plaintiff
for
summary
judgment.
we
think
both
of
the
courts
below
were
in
error
and
that
summary
judgment
should
have
been
entered
in
favor
of
plaintiff
against
the
defendant,
farr
whitlock.
the
facts
are
somewhat
complex,
but
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
sketching
them
in
rather
quickly
and
only
in
broad
outline
because
the
details
are
really
not
necessary
for
a
full
understanding
of
the
critical
issue
that
confronts
the
court
on
this
record.
some
time
prior
to
19--
to
july
of
1960
and
about
april
or
may,
a
sugar
brokerage
firm
in
new
york
by
the
name
of
farr
whitlock
entered
into
two
contracts
with
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
a
cuban
corporation,
compania
azucarera
vertientes-ca
aguey,
which
is
referred
to
in
this
proceeding
by
the
initials
c.a.v.
although
farr
whitlock
was
a
sugar
broker,
it
was
buying
this
sugar
on
its
own
account.
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
sugar
was
to
be
shipped
to
morocco,
but
payment
was
to
be
made
in
new
york
upon
presentation
of
the
bill
of
ladings
and
other
shipping
documents
accompanied
by
a
sight
draft
for
the
purchase
price
of
the
sugar
in
accordance
with
normal
commercial
practice.
the
price
of
the
sugar
was
approximately
$175,000.
the
record
shows
that
c.a.v.
was
incorporated
in
cuba
and
that
about
90%
or
in
excess
of
90%
of
its
stockholders
are
said
to
be
residents
of
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
into
the
--
in
the
record
as
to
the
nationality
of
those
stockholders.
on
july
6,
the
republic
of
cuba
adopted
a
decree
authorizing
the
nationalization
of
property
owned
by
nationals
of
the
united
states
or
properties
in
which
the
united
states
nationals
had
an
interest.
under
the
terms
of
the
decree,
compensation
was
to
be
paid
by
the
issuance
of
20-year-bonds
and
the
funds
behind
the
bonds
were
to
come
from
the
proceeds
of
sales
of
sugar
to
the
united
states.
on
that
very
same
day,
the
president
of
the
united
states
signed
the
sugar
act
of
1960,
which
sharply
curtailed
the
purchases
of
sugar
by
the
united
states
from
cuba,
although
the
act,
of
course,
had
been
passed
by
congress
a
few
days
previously.
one
month
later,
on
august
6,
by
a
resolution
made
pursuant
to
the
decree
that
i
have
mentioned,
the
property
of
c.a.v.
and
25
other
corporations
were
nationalized.
this
was
one
of
a
long
series
of
decrees,
which
are
--
some
of
which
are
referred
to
in
a
footnote
at
page
39
of
petitioner's
brief,
which
began
in
may
of
1959
and
which,
in
the
end,
transformed
cuba
from
a
capitalist
to
a
socialist
economy.
on
the
day
of
the
decree,
the
sugar
was
being
loaded
on
a
freighter
which
was
anchored
in
territorial
waters
of
cuba.
actually,
the
loading
was
not
completed
until
august
9.
the
ship
remained
in
territorial
waters
until
august
11
and,
on
that
day,
new
contracts
were
signed
by
farr
whitlock
with
a
cuban
governmental
bank.
these
contracts
were
identical
in
terms,
even
as
to
the
date,
with
the
original
contract
signed
between
farr
whitlock
and
c.a.v.
and
we
contend
that
this
contract
recognized
the
ownership
of
the
cuban
government
in
this
sugar.
a
day
or
two
later,
the
sugar
went
off
to
morocco.
the
bills
of
lading
were
assigned
to
the
petitioner
which
is
the
national
bank
of
cuba
and
they
were
sent
to
societe
general,
a
french
bank
which
acted
as
the
new
york
agent
of
the
petitioner,
together
with
a
sight
draft
in
the
sum
of
$175,000.
while
the
bills
of
lading
were
in
transit
and,
on
august
16,
1960,
in
a
proceeding
commenced
in
the
new
york
state
supreme
court,
a
receiver
was
appointed
over
the
new
york
assets
of
c.a.v.
pursuant
to
section
977
(b)
of
the
civil
practice
act.
as
a
result
of
subsequent
proceedings,
that
receivership
was
set
aside
and
vacated.
that
happened
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
case,
the
court--
supreme
court
in
kings
county
new
york
holding
that
the
receivership
was
improper
in
the
first
place.
on
august
26,
farr
whitlock
and
c.a.v.
entered
into
a
contract.
by
the
terms
of
which,
farr
whitlock
agreed
that
if
it
could
get
possession
of
the
sugar
or
of
the
proceeds,
it
would
hold
those
proceeds
for
c.a.v.,
instead
of
turning
them
over
to
societe
general.
in
return,
c.a.v.
agreed
to
hold
farr
whitlock
harmless
for
any
loss
it
might
suffer
as
a
result
of
this
transaction
and
also
agreed
to
pay
it
10%
of
the
proceeds
so
that,
although
farr
whitlock
has
been
referred
to
in
this
proceeding
on
a
number
of
occasions
as
only
as
stakeholder,
actually,
it
stands
to
gain
some
of
the
sum
of
$17,500
if
it
should
prevail
in
this
lawsuit.
on
august
29,
by
means
of
a
trick
which
we
think
equaled
fraud,
it
certainly
resembles
fraud,
farr
whitlock
managed
to
get
possession
of
the
bills
of
lading
without
actually
honoring
the
sight
draft.
using
the
bills
of
lading,
it
negotiated
them,
sold
the
sugar,
and
received
$175,000
for
it.
it
refused
to
pay
that
$175,000
over
to
societe
general
and
this
lawsuit,
which
alleges
a
conversion
of
the
bills
of
lading
and
the
sugar
that
they
represented,
was
commenced.
a
day
or
two
later,
the
money
was
turned
over
to
the
receiver
and,
upon
determination
of
the
receivership,
the
money
which,
together
with
interest
in
course,
now
amounts
to
something
over
$200,000
was
turned
up
to
a--
over
to
an
escrow
agent
who
now
holds
those
funds
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
it's
a
french
bank.
it's
a
private
bank
which
is
owned
by
french
interest.
it
has
an
agency
in
new
york
and
it
engages
in
normal
commercial
business
and
it
was
acting
as
an
agent
here,
not
an
agency
of,
but
a
commercial
agent
for
the
government
of
cuba
in
the
transaction
of
these
businesses.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
banco
nacional
was
the
assignee--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
of
the
cuban
government
or
the
cuban
bank
which
entered
into
the
contract
in
the
first
place.
societe
generale
was
merely
an
agent
of
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
sued
here.
societe
generale
was
perhaps
liable
to
banco
nacional
for
negligence
in
handing
over
the
bills
of
lading
without
getting
the
draft,
but
banco
nacional
chose
not
to
sue
societe
generale,
its
agent,
but
rather
sue
directly
for
its--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
there
was
no
negotiation--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
was
purely
a
collection
agent.
there
seem
to
be
no
question
of
fact
in
this
case
and,
accordingly,
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment.
farr
whitlock
defended
on
two
grounds.
first,
it
claimed
that
the
federal
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
of
the
pendency
of
the
new
york
state
receivership
and,
second,
it
raised
the
series
of
issues
of
fact.
neither
of
those
grounds
is
raised
in
this
court
and
we
assume
that
they
have
been
abandoned.
the
district
court
first
considered
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
it
then
considered
the
factual
questions
and
decided
those
in
favor
of
petitioner,
holding
that
there
were
no
triable
issues
of
fact.
we
would
have
thought
that,
under
these
circumstances,
summary
judgment
would
have
resulted
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
that
the
court
then
went
on
to
decide
the
case
on
a
ground
that
had
not
been
urged
before
it,
that
had
not
been
argued
before
it,
that
had
not
been
briefed
before
it,
and
that
i
don't
think
that
any
counsel
had
even
thought
about
it
because,
to
us
at
least,
the
law
seemed
so
clear
that
there
was
no
point
in
arguing
the
matter.
despite
a
long
line
of
cases
of
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
known
generally
as
the
act
of
state
cases,
and
i
shall
of
course
refer
to
them
again
later
in
my
argument,
it
held
that
there
was
an
exception
to
the
act
of
state
case,
namely
that
they
did
not
apply
where
the
decree
of
a
foreign
government
violated
international
law.
it
then
examined
the
decree
of
the
cuban
government
in
this
case
and
it
found
that
violation
of
international
law
had
indeed
existed
in
three
respects.
first,
that
the
cuban
decree
was
discriminatory
against
citizens
of
the
united
states;
second,
that
it
was
retaliatory
and
third,
that
it
confiscated
a
property
without
adequate
compensation.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
somewhat
different
ground.
it
held
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
subject
to
another
exception.
this
was
the
exception
which
it,
the
same
court,
had
found,
in
about
1947
i
think,
in
the
second
bernstein
case,
and
that's
reported
in
210
f.2d
375.
i
shall
refer
to
that
again
later,
although
i
think
that
the
major
burden
of
the
argument,
at
least
the
major
burden
of
the
brief
on
this
subject,
will
probably
be
carried
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
any
event,
the
court
found
that
the
bernstein
exception
was
present
here,
relying
on
fragments
of
correspondents
which
were
submitted
to
it,
not
by
us
of
course
and
not
by
farr
whitlock,
but
by
an
amicus
which
had
sought
and
received
leave
to
file
an
amicus
brief.
and,
these
fragments
of
correspondents
were
handed
up
to
the
court
and
the
court
relied
on
these
to
hold
that
the
bernstein
exception
applied
in
this
case.
it
then
went
on
to
decide
that
the
cuban
decree
had
violated
international
law
and,
while
it
didn't
find
the
same
three
violations
of
international
law
that
the
district
court
had
find,
it
sort
of
grouped
all
of
them
together
and,
to
use
its
language,
it
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
international
law
for
a
company
to
fail
to
pay
adequate
compensation
for
the
property
it
seizes
from
a
particular
class
of
aliens
when
the
purpose
for
the
seizure
of
the
property
is
to
retaliate
against
the
homeland
of
those
aliens
and
when
the
result
of
such
seizure
is
to
discriminate
against
them
only.
in
another
words,
it
took
the
three
grounds
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
had
found
and
locked
them
all
together
to
make
one
single
ground.
in
our
opinion,
the
basic
question
before
the
court
here
is
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
both
our
brief
and,
to
an
even
greater
extent,
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
enters
into
a
rather
extensive
consideration
of
the
history
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
both
of
us
say
that
this
doctrine
really
dates
from
1674
in
an
english
case.
but,
in
modern
times,
it
may
be
said
to
date
from
underhill
against
hernandez,
although
there's
some
language
in
the
schooner
exchange
which
does
seem
to
foreshadow
this
same
doctrine.
now,
there
are
many,
many
formulations
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
decision
for
this
court.
in
oetjen
against
central
leather
company,
for
example,
this
court
said
the
conduct
of
one
independent
government
cannot
be
successfully
questioned
in
the
course
of
another.
mr.
justice
holmes
earlier,
in
the
american
banana
company
case,
had
said
“the
general
and
almost
universal
rule
is
that
the
character
of
an
act
as
lawful
or
unlawful
must
be
determined
wholly
by
the
law
of
the
country
in
which
the
act
is
done.
”there
is
similar
language
in
shapleigh
against
mier,
in
the
belmont
case,
in
the
pink
case,
all
of
them
in
this
court
and,
most
recently,
in
the
case
of
pons
against
the
republic
of
cuba
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court,
i
believe,
in
1961
and
it
presents
a
cuba
situation.
the
others,
of
course,
represented
either
latin
american
nationalizations
or
russian
nationalizations.
the
new
york
courts
hold
to
the
same
effect,
and
this
is
of
some
significance
because
there
are
some
suggestion
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
decisions
of
the
--
in
the
briefs
of
--
the
many
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
in
opposition
to
the
petitioner,
that
perhaps,
under
the
erie
against
tompkins
case,
the
new
york
law
applies,
but
it
really
doesn't
matter
because
the
new
york
cases
are
in
complete
agreement.
salimoff
against
standard
oil,
in
1933,
is
perhaps
typical.
it
says
“the
courts
of
one
independent
government
will
not
sit
in
judgment
upon
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
another
done
within
its
own
territory,
even
when
such
government
seizes
and
sells
the
property
of
an
american
citizen
within
its
boundaries
and,
to
the
same
effect,
the
dougherty
case
and
holzer
against
deutsche
reichsbahn,
the
last
one
being
a
case
involving
actions
by
the
nazi
government
of
germany.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'll
be
glad
to
come
to
that,
your
honor.
i
hope
i
remember
it,
and
if
i
don't--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
boudin
will
remind
me
if
i
forget.
i
certainly
shall.
we,
and
the
solicitor
general,
say
that
this
doctrine,
the
act
of
states
doctrine
is
generally
accepted
throughout
the
world
by
the
courts
of
most
other
countries.
there's
no
doubt
that
it's
accepted
it
in
england
in
luther
against
sagor.
c.a.v.
disagrees
and
so
do
some
of
the
other
amicus
briefs.
and,
frankly,
i
see
no
particular
point
in
spending
the
time
of
this
court
in
discussing
decisions
in
bremen,
turin,
singapore,
nuremberg,
venice,
aden,
and
many
other
cases
throu--
many
other
similar
points
throughout
the
world.
all
of
them
are
discussed
in
the
brief
and
to
be
honest,
i
really
don't
see
why
they
make
very
much
difference
because
the
law
in
the
united
states
and
england
is
identical
and
i
have
just
stated
it,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
should
make
very
much
difference
what
the
court
of
venice
thinks
about
this
question.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
except
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
except
that
we
are
in
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
anglo-american
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
system
of
law
and
i
just
want
to
get
the
anglo
in.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
so,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
there
is
some
suggestion
that
the
doctrine
does
apply
even
where
the
foreign
government
has
not
been
recognized
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
before
us
because
the
foreign
government
has
been
recognized
in
this
case.
there
are
no
diplomatic
relations,
but
the
foreign
government
has
been
recognized
and
there
is
material,
i
think
it's
in
this
record,
but
certainly
in
ricoeur
and
many
other
cases
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
has
written
letters
to
various
courts
throughout
the
country
saying
“the
cuba
--
the
cuban
government
has
been
recognized
by
the
united
states.”
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
still
is.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
throughout
the
period
of
transactions
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
including
today.
the
c.a.v.
brief
says
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
supported
by
commentators
and
decisions
of
courts
in
other
countries
and
that
may
be
true,
but
i
don't
consider
it
to
be
decisive.
not
only
is
there
no
legal
authority
to
support
the
respondent
here,
but
i
submit
that
there
are
no
policy
considerations
either.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
extensively
because
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
handles
this
matter
rather
fully
and
is
--
i'm
sure,
plans
to
consider
these
policy
considerations.
i
would
like
just
to
mention
two
points,
however,
which
are
relevant.
c.a.v.
and
many
of
the
amicus
briefs
make
quite
a
point
of
an
argument
which
we
don't
make.
they
make
quite
a
point
in
answering
an
argument
that
we
don't
make
and
that,
i
believe,
the
solicitor
general
makes
either
and
they
say
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
decide
cases
even
though
they
affect
foreign
relations
and
it
quotes
cases
like
the
familiar
ground
against
canal
and
other
similar
cases.
now,
i
certainly
would
not
argue
that
this
court
doesn't
have
any
power
to
decide
cases
which
involve
foreign
relations.
the
court
has
done
so
many
times,
and
i
would
not
argue
for
any
such
broad
proposition.
for
example,
there
is
a
citation
--
there
is
a
reference
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
decision
in
baker
against
carr
in
which
the
opinion
makes
some
reference
to
the
language
in
the
ricoeur
case,
i
believe,
and
says
that
this
language
is
too
broad
that
the
court
frequently
does
handle
problems
involving
foreign
relations.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
that
question.
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
all
we
are
saying,
so
far
as
this
case
in
concerned,
that
our
court
should
recognize
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
other
states
disposing
of
title
to
property
within
their
territorial
jurisdiction.
that's
all
i
have
to
say
in
this
case
and
that's
all
that
i
am
asking
the
court
to
rule
on.
if
we
have
other
problems
in
other
cases,
we
will
consider
them
in
due
course.
to
hold
otherwise
is
to
challenge
or
to
question
the
sovereignty
of
other
nations,
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said
“what
is
sovereignty,
but
the
right
to
make
decisions
as
to
property
within
your
own
territory.”
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
it's
a
rule
of
international
law,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
whether
it
is
or
not.
i
think
it's
a
rule
of
this
court
and
i'm
willing
to
rely
on
this
court.
i
think
that
most
courts
hold
that
way.
you
see,
the
difficulty
with
the
whole
feel
of
international
law,
and
we'll
come
to
this
a
little
later,
is
that
there
is
a
general
tendency
on
the
part
of
our
courts,
and
it's
natural
enough,
under
the
circumstances,
to
regard
international
law
as
being
something
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
western
europe
hold.
now,
the
fact
is
that
most
of
the
people
in
the
world
don't
live
in
united
states
or
western
europe.
they
live
in
africa
and
they
live
in
asia
and
they
live
in
latin
america
and
we
do
not
have
from
those
courts
a
body
of
opinion
of
judicial
decisions
which
enable
us
to
tell
at
this
time
what
indonesia
or
pakistan
or
india
or
china
think
about
these
issues.
most
of
the
people
in
the
world
live
in
those
countries,
not
in
the
united
states
and
great
britain
and
germany
and
so
the
whole
question
of
international
law
on
issues
like
this
is
really
a
matter
which
is
of
very,
very
great
value.
so,
i
can't
say
“the
court
say
international
law
is
the
practice
of
most
civilized
nations.
”i
don't
know
and
i
don't
believe
that
anybody
knows
what
international
law
is
in
this
rapidly
expanding
world
of
today
with
so
many
new
nations
being
created
almost
everyday.
so,
it's
a
pretty
hard
thing
to
tell.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
have
never
considered
this
to
be
a
rule
of
abstention,
your
honor.
i
have
always
considered
this
to
be
a
rule
of
positive
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it's
our
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
say
that
with
one
qualification.
i
am
now
talking
about
nationalization
of
property
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
nationalizing
country.
now,
there
are
other
cases
where
property
in
new
york
is
nationalized,
and
there
are
other
cuban
cases
raising
tat
issue,
but
we
haven't
reached
those
yet.
we
may
someday,
but
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
extending
myself
to
that
question
at
the
moment
because
this
property
was
in
cuba.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
should
think
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
solicitor
general
says
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
not
justiciable
in
that
sense.
i
think
it's
not
justiciable
for
other
reasons,
but
not
in
that
sense.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
whether
the
executive
may
do
it
is
a
diplomatic
matter.
the
executive
frequently
questions
the
validity
of
acts
of
foreign
countries.
this
is
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
question
of
breaking
international
law.
the
executive
frequently
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
signs
a
note
saying
that
this
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
this
is
all
on
the
give
and
take
of
diplomacy
and
speeches
are
made
and
arguments
are
made
and,
in
diplomatic
negotiations.
i
think
the
executive
is
entitled
to
a
freehand
in
this
and
i
certainly
would
not
limit
the
or
--
seek
to
limit
the
executive,
even
if
i
could,
in
any
question
as
to
what
kind
of
position
the
executive
is
going
to
take
in
the
give
and
take
of
the
politics
of
the
modern
world.
i
think
this
is
for
the
executive
to
determine
and
i
think
that
the
executive
has
a
freehand,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
any
role
in
determining
what
this
court
will
decide.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
connection
with
this
problem
of
the
policy
behind
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
an
illustration
that
i
would
like
to
present
to
your
honors
which
is
not
a
hypothetical
illustration,
but
is
an
actual
one
and
which
i
think
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
why
the
court
ought
to
stay
out
of
this
area
and
why
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
sound
one
and
it
arose
under
these
circumstances.
on
july
24,
1961,
an
eastern
airline
plane
was
hijacked
by
an
armed
passenger
who
took
the
plane
from
miami
to
havana
together
with
all
of
the
passengers.
the
passengers
came
back
the
next
day
but,
on
august
16th,
the
plane
was
returned
by
the
cuban
government
after
a
great
deal
of
diplomatic
negotiation
between
the
swiss
and
czech
as
these
things
are
handled
now.
on
the
very
next
day,
august
17th,
a
cuban
freighter
was
hijacked
and
was
brought
into
norfolk
harbor.
this
presented
a
political
situation
of,
i
think,
considerable
importance
and
it
was
made
even
more
critical
by
the
fact
that,
on
board
that
freighter,
there
was
a
cargo
of
sugar
and
it
was
owned
by
united
fruit
company
or
at
least
united
fruit
company
claimed
to
own
it.
it
was
a
cargo
of
sugar
that
had
been
nationalized
by
the
very
same
decree
that
we
are
here
considering,
and
united
fruit
came
in
and
said
“we
don't
care
about
the
freighter,
but
the
sugar
belongs
to
us.
”
now,
the
case
of
united
fruit
was
just
as
strong
and
just
as
weak
as
the
case
of
c.a.v.
in
this
re
--
in
this
circumstance.
every
single
word
of
the
c.a.
brief
--
c.a.v.
brief,
between
page
12
and
page
58,
could
have
been
written
by
united
fruit
merely
with
a
substitution
of
the
name
united
fruit
for
c.a.v.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
money
is
held
by
an
escrowee,
i
believe,
it's
lehman
brothers.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
by
an
escrowee,
under
an
escrow
agreement
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
among
c.a.v.,
farr,
whitlock,
and
ourselves.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
subject
to
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
don't
have
the
escrow
agreement
in
front
of
me
and
i'm
not
sure
about
what
would
happen
in
that
case,
except
i'm
pretty
sure
lehman
brothers
wouldn't
keep
it.
i
believe
the
escrow
agreement
provides
that,
in
the
event
of
the
final
order
in
our
favor,
the
money
is
to
be
paid
over
to
us.
under
what
circumstances
to
be
paid
over
to
farr,
whitlock,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
never
suggested,
your
honor,
that
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
some
of
the
other
people
suggested
that,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
i
said
it,
what
--
i
didn't
mean
it
in
the
way
your
honor
does.
what
i
meant
was
that
the
courts
should
recognize
the
validity
of
the
decrees
of
a
foreign
government
and
should
keep
hands
off
in
the
sense
that
they
should
not
inquire
into
the
validity
of
the
decree.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me.
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
your
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
title.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
should
think
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
so
argue.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
because
the
courts
haven't
thrown
the
whole
case
out
in
similar
situations
in
united
states
against
pink,
in
united
states
against
belmont,
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
pons
case.
the
court
proceeded,
made
no
distinction
between
whether
the
expropriating
government
for
the
nationalizing
government
was
a
plaintiff
for
the
defendant,
and
i
think
that
the
brief
of
the
united
states
handles
this
question
quite
well,
that
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
accident
in
how
the
case
happens
to
come
before
the
court.
it
really
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
situation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
there
is
any
authority,
aside
from
the
briefs
that
had
been
submitted
here,
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
rule
of
abstention
in
the
sense
that
the
court
will
abstain
from
considering
the
whole
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
the
judge
made
rule
in
any
event,
but
it's
supported
by
a
long
line
of
authority.
i
was
discussing
the
bahia
de
nipe
case,
that
being
the
name
of
the
freighter
that
was
brought
into
the
court
in
norfolk
and,
as
i
said,
the
arguments
there
made
by
united
fruit
were
identical
with
the
arguments
that
were
made
here
by
c.a.v.
now,
the
state
department
moved
in
that
case
with
the
greatest
rapidity
and,
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
don't
know
what
happened
before
the
district
court
because
i
wasn't
there.
but,
in
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
united
states
attorney
pointed
out
the
very
great
importance
in
political
term
that
the
united
states
could
hardly
refuse
to
do
what
cuba
had
done
the
day
before
in
returning
property
which
had
been
hijacked,
and
it
urged
great
speed
upon
the
court
and
the
court
did,
in
fact,
act
with
great
speed.
altogether,
three
weeks,
i
think,
elapsed
between
the
dis
--
between
the
day
that
the
ship
came
into
the
harbor
and
the
denial
of
the
state,
pending
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
the
chief
justice
here.
and,
united
fruit
argued,
relying
on
the
sabbatino
case,
this
case,
that
the
property,
the
sugar,
belonged
to
it.
and,
the
government
argued,
as
it
does
here,
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
meant
that
the
property
belonged
to
the
cuban
government
and
the
chief
judge
denied
a
stay,
citing
as
authority,
therefore,
the
underhill
and,
i
think,
ricaud
cases.
c.a.v.
apparently
agrees
with
that
decision
and
it
says
in
a
footnote
that
the
decision
was
“compelled
by
urgent
considerations.”
i
think
that's
pretty
important.
there's
a
question
as
to
who
is
to
decide
what
the
urge
and
considerations
are.
are
they
the
litigants
to
a
lawsuit?
are
they
the
court
or
is
it
state
department?
who
knows
what
the
urge
and
considerations
are
in
this
case?
who
is
it
that
decides
what
is
urgent
and
what
is
not
urgent?
are
we
to
read
the
new
york
times
and,
on
the
basis
of
that,
decide
that
initial
issue
is
an
important
political
issue
and
that
the
courts
ought
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other
or
are
the
urgent
considerations
more
properly
within
the
cognizance
and
the
sole
--
i
suggest
in
this
situation,
sole
cognizance
of
the
executive
department.
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
a
court
ought
to
get
into.
not
because
it,
in
broad
general
terms,
affects
foreign
affairs,
but
because,
in
a
much
more
narrow
sense,
it
affects
the
problem
of
the
sovereignty
of
other
nations
and,
in
this
case,
it
affects
the
rights,
as
i
shall
come
to
in
a
few
minutes
in
discussing
the
problem
of
the
freeze,
if
i
get
the
time,
the
very
mo
--
very
important
question
of
the
rights
of
other
american
property
holders
and
the
entire
problem
of
settlement
with
foreign
countries
for
a
na
--
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
compensation
for
nationalized
property.
and,
this
isn't
the
first
time
this
problem
has
arisen
of
course.
it's
arisen
dozens
of
times
before.
now,
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
relied
on
the
bernstein
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
i'm
not
going
to
discuss
it,
except
to
say
that
we
don't
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
bernstein
exception
and
that,
even
if
there
were,
the
respondent
doesn't
come
into
it
and
i'll
leave
that
to
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly,
that's
why
i
don't
think
there
is
any
exception.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
constitutional
question.
i
base
it
on
this
long
line
of
cases
which
i
have
cited,
which
speak
of
this
in
terms
of
a
positive
rule
of
law,
namely,
that
the
courts
of
united
states
have
no
authority
or
should
not
test
upon
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
a
foreign
government.
and,
i
don't
believe
the
single
exception
of
the
bernstein
case,
which
was
never
reviewed
by
this
court.
i
don't
believe
any
of
those
cases
talk
in
terms
of
judicial
abstention.
they
just
say
“this
is
not
a
subject
for
us
to
decide,”
and
i
think
that
it
will
become
clear
when
we
examine
the
international
law
problems
that
are
raised
here
as
to
why
it's
not
a
subject
that
a
court
should
decide.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
your
honor
has
authority
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
said
your
honor
has
no
auth
--
what
i
meant,
whatever
i
may
have
said,
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
the
court
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
the
court
has
no
authority
to
look
into
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
a
foreign
government
done
with
respect
to
property
within
its
territory,
and
that's
all
that
i'm
arguing
in
this
case.
i'm
not
arguing
anything
further,
that
you
might
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir,
on
that
count.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states,
before
the
court
of
international
justice
and
elsewhere,
has
claimed
the
same
thing
for
itself.
it
has
claimed,
as
it
did
in
the
general
aniline
case,
that
its
disposition
of
stock
of
the
general
aniline
company,
that
stock
being
located
in
the
united
states,
was
exclusively
a
matter
of
domestic
jurisdiction
and
that
the
department
of
court
of
international
justice
had
no
right
to
look
into
the
question
as
to
whether
the
united
states
decree,
seizing
property
of
general
aniline
corporation,
was
proper
or
not,
whether
it
belonged
to
switzerland
or
whether
it
belonged
to
swiss
nationals
or
it
belonged
to
german
nationals,
that
--
and
the
united
states
so
argued
and
the
matter
is
cited
in
my
brief.
so,
we
have
also
taken
advantage
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
when
it
suited
our
purpose.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
has
the
freeze
regulation
that
has
the
effect
of
a
seizure.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
know.
they
haven't,
as
far
as
i
know,
but
whether
they
would
claim
the
right
to
or
not,
i
don't
know.
of
course,
there
isn't
really
a
seizure,
and
i'll
get
to
it
later
if
i
can,
it's
a
sort
of
conditional
seizure
because
the
seizure
is
subject
to
administrative
license
and
it
may
be
released
by
in
--
either
immediately
or
in
due
course.
i
assume
the
treasury
department
will
have
to
decide
that
for
extensions.
assuming,
however,
that
the
act
of
state
doesn't
mean
what
i
think
it
means
and
assuming
that
there
is
a
bernstein
exception
so
that
we
do
get
to
the
question
on
which
the
courts
below
decided
the
case,
we
now
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
decree
of
the
government
of
cuba
was
in
fact
a
violation
of
international
law.
now,
everybody
agrees
that
the
--
there
is
no
issue
of
international
law
unless
c.a.v.
is
to
be
treated
as
an
american
national
because,
otherwise,
it's
just
a
controversy
between
cuba
and
a
cuban
national
and
there's
no
international
law
involved
in
the
situation.
c.a.v.
contends
that
it's
to
be
treated
as
an
american
national
and
it
relies
on
this
from
the
fact
that
the
--
there's
something
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
90%
or
over
90%
of
the
shareholders
of
c.a.v.
are
residents
of
the
united
states.
now,
in
this
day
of
extensive
migration
from
cuba
to
the
united
states,
i
don't
know
what
that
means
in
terms
of
nationals
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
law
said
property
owned
by
nationals
or
in
which
national
--
nationals
of
the
united
states
or
in
which
nationals
of
the
united
states
have
an
interest.
now,
how
big
an
interest,
i
really
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
that
really
makes
any
difference.
the
fact
is
that
c.a.v.
was
incorporated
in
cuba
and
the
law,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
pretty
much
without
exception,
says
that
a
corpo
--
the
nationality
of
a
corporation
is
the
nationality
of
its
incor
--
of
the
state
of
its
incorporation.
and,
the
pedro
case
is
perhaps
the
leading
authority
on
it
in
which
the
court
pointed
out
that,
after
all,
if
a
ship
owner
decides
that
he
wants
the
advantages
of
the
spanish
flag
by
registering
his
ship
under
the
spanish
flag
and
by
incorporating
in
spain,
he
cannot
later
claim
the
protection
of
some
other
flag.
i
believe,
in
this
case,
it
was
the
british
flag.
c.a.v.
chose
to
incorporate
in
cuba,
presumably
it
got
tax
advantages
and
other
legal
advantages
from
its
incorporation
in
cuba
and,
now,
at
this
moment,
to
come
in
and
claim
the
protection
of
the
american
flag,
it
seems
to
me,
is
somewhat
belated.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
of
course
not
because
no
one
thought
of
this
whole
problem
below,
as
i've
said.
no
one
ever
raised
this
issue
at
all
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
because
the
whole
problem,
no
one
discussed
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
act
of
state
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
it
was
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
court
merely
said,
inaccurately,
that
90%
of
the
--
of
the
stockholders
of
c.a.v.
are
american
nationals.
now,
they
equated
the
word
“nationals”
and
“residents”
which,
of
course,
are
not
equal
at
all.
but,
the
record
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
nationality
of
the
stockholders.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
did
say
that
they
were
nationals.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
is
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
hadn't
heard
it
suggested
before
the
--
this
court
or
the
courts
of
the
united
states
were
to
be
their
issue
--
their
view
of
legal
issues
is
to
be
determined
by
what
the
cuban
law
says.
it's
true
that
the
cuban
law
did
refer
to
the
properties
or
enterprises
owned
by
physical
and
corporate
persons
who
are
nationals
of
the
united
states
or
the
enterprises
in
which
such
physical
and
corporate
persons
have
an
interest.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
68
of
what,
your
honor?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
there
is
one
--
the
law
contains
this
formulation
in
three
places,
i
think,
and,
once,
it
refers
to
predominant
and,
the
other
cases,
it
refers
to
just
an
interest.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
yes.
i
think
that's
true.
but,
i
must
disagree
with
your
honor
because
it
seems
to
me
that
this
raises
a
series
of
problems
that
are
really
very
difficult
if
we
are
to
determine
the
nationality
of
a
--
of
a
corporation
incorporated
in
cuba
by
what
the
nationality
of
its
shareholders
even
though
cuba
may
choose
to
do
so.
i
don't
believe
that
our
courts
have
ever
done
so,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
extensive
problems
which
are
raised
in
my
brief
which
are
covered
--
which
make
this
a
problem
which
would
be
extremely
awkward
to
administer
in
the
courtroom.
for
example,
it's
suggested
that
the
court
will
have
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
corporation
was
owned
by
cubans
and
what
percentage
by
american
citizens,
and
i
don't
even
know
how
the
court
will
go
about
that.
let
me
turn,
however,
to
the
question
of
whether,
assuming
that
it
was
an
american
corporation,
whether
there
has
been
any
violation
of
international
law
here,
and
this
is
the
last,
assuming
everything
else
is
against
me.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
violation
of
international
law
which
here
been
shown.
and,
i
would
like
just
to
point
out
that
the
world
of
today
is
not
the
world
of
50
years
ago
and
that
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
world
today,
speaking
in
international
terms,
is
a
revolutionary
search
which
has
created
scores
of
new
countries
and
has
brought
about
sweeping
changes
in
the
economic
systems
of
many
old
ones.
no
longer
can
we
look
to
the
law
of
the
united
states
in
western
europe
and,
on
the
basis
of
that
research,
discover
what
is
international
law.
if
international
law
is
the
practice
of
civilized
nations,
and
so
the
courts
so
text
write
it
at
least
and
i
guess
the
courts
have
also
held
the
decision
by
chief
judge
marshall
in
the
antelope,
i
think
is
a
very
good
example,
we
have
to
look
not
only
to
our
law
but
to
the
law
of
eastern
europe,
the
law
of
africa,
the
law
of
asia,
the
law
of
latin
america,
to
ceylon,
to
indonesia,
to
egypt,
to
cuba,
to
china,
to
name
only
a
few.
and,
we
can't
just
look
at
american
presidents,
and
german
presidents,
and
french
presidents.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
international
law,
namely
the
practice
of
civilized
nations,
makes
what
cuba
did
here
a
violation
of
any
law.
on
the
contrary,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
nations
of
the
world,
perhaps
representing
a
substantial
majority
of
the
population
of
the
world,
have
done
exactly
what
cuba
has
done
here.
it
certainly
has
been
done
in
indonesia.
it
has
been
done
in
china.
it
has
been
done
in
all
of
eastern
europe.
and,
it
has
been
done
in
many
parts
of
latin
america,
in
ceylon,
and
many
other
places.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
might
very
well
be.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i'm
not
certain.
i
think
that
nationalizations
of
property
go
back
to
the
nationalization
of
the
properties
of
the
church
of
rome
by
henry
viii
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
15
--
i
don't
know
when
it
was
but,
certainly,
no
compensation
was
ever
made
for
that
nationalization.
so,
i'm
not
sure
about
what
the
situation
would
have
been
50
years
or
500
years
ago.
but,
today,
it
may
be
hard
for
us
to
take,
but
private
property
doesn't
quite
hold
the
status
in
other
countries
in
other
parts
of
the
world
that
it
does
here.
an
international
law
cited
by
the
respondent
and
c.a.v.
and
most
commentators
are
almost
all
from
the
older
nations
of
the
world.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
that's
a
hard
case
and
it's
a
hard
case
that
--
one
of
those
hard
cases
that
make
bad
law
and
i
think
that
i
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
bernstein
--
first
bernstein
case
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
did
in
the
holzer
case,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
my
brief,
and
i
would
have
done
it
with
a
great
deal
of
regret
and
i
suppose
it
would've
been
one
of
those
times
when
i
would
have
regretted
being
a
judge,
had
i
been
one
at
the
time,
but
i
think
that
that's
what
the
law
did.
and,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
a
case
that
i
cited
before,
namely,
the
decision
of
judge
marshall
in
the
antelope
in
which
he
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
whether
slave
trade
was
a
violation
of
international
law.
and,
after
excoriating
slave
trade
and
pointing
to
all
of
the
terrible
miseries
that
result
into
slave
trade
which
was
illegal
in
the
united
states,
he
said,
“how
can
we
call
this
a
violation
of
international
law
when
two
of
the
greatest
countries
in
the
world,
spain
and
portugal,
still
find
it
legal?
it's
a
terrible
thing.
it's
immoral.
it's
a
very,
very
despicable
thing
but
it
is
not
a
violation
of
international
law."
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
said
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
said
the
law
of
civilized
nations,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
whether
a
nation
is
civilized
is
a
justiciable
question
and
i
certainly
think
that,
for
the
united
states
to
hold
that
ceylon,
for
example,
which
has
just
appropriated
large
amounts
of
american
property,
or
indonesia
which
has
just
--
which
has
recently
appropriated
all
of
the
dutch
tobacco
plantations,
i
don't
believe
that,
in
political
terms,
for
this
court
to
hold
that
those
countries
are
not
civilized
would
be
helpful.
now,
we
have
here
an
act
which
is
trying
to
be
statutory,
retaliatory,
and
no
compensation.
now,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
really
don't
have
time
to
consider
all
of
these
things.
they're
fully
discussed
in
the
brief.
i
might
say
that,
so
far
as
the
discrimination
is
concerned,
this
is
was
one
of
a
series
of
decrees
which
nationalized
united
states
property,
cuban
property,
english
property,
canadian
property,
taiwan
property,
and
lots
of
other
property
that
was
located
in
cuba
and,
while
this
particular
decree
was
directed
to
a
particular
group
of
companies,
other
decrees
were
related
to
other
ones
and
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
difference
of
treatment.
all
of
them
were
rela
--
were
expropriated
in
exactly
the
same
way.
also,
there's
been
no
determination
anywhere,
no
facts
have
been
taken
to
determine
whether
this
was
a
discrimination
and
what
the
--
whether
the
discrimination
was
a
proper
one,
that
is,
equal
treatment
is
not
always
the
same
as
discrimination
because,
sometimes,
equal
treatment
is
not
appropriate
where
the
parties
are
unequal.
the
government
has
al
--
or
the
respondent
has
also
claimed
that
this
was
retaliatory.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
well,
this
was
a
retaliation
for
the
sugar
act
of
1960
and,
whether
the
sugar
act
was
fair
or
unfair,
nevertheless,
cuba
had
no
right
to
retaliate.
well,
whether
it's
fair
or
unfair,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
own
opinion,
is
a
rather
important
thing
and
i
don't
think
we
can
brush
off
the
standard
of
fairness
just
because
it's
a
matter
that
it
is
applied
to
the
law
of
the
united
states.
if
the
standard
of
fairness
is
to
be
applied
and
that's
a
reason
for
a
court's
decision,
then
it
should
be
applied
to
all
of
it
and
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
of
fairness
can
be
applied
only
to
the
cuban
decrees
and
not
to
american
law.
and,
finally,
i
would
like
to
get
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
compensation.
the
court
of
appeals
says
there
is
no
international
law
on
the
subject
of
compensation.
the
respondent
and
c.a.v.
don't
accept
that
at
all.
i
suspect
that's
the
issue
that
they
are
mostly
interested
in.
if
they
could
get
compensation,
i
don't
think
they'd
be
worried
too
much
about
the
discriminatory
or
retaliatory
aspect
of
this.
there
are
extensive
citations
in
my
brief.
i
think
most
of
the
extensive
nationalizations
of
the
world
in
the
past,
well,
since
1917
and
perhaps
before
that,
were
without
compensation.
now,
it's
true
that
in
many
cases,
compensation
was
worked
out
ultimately,
but
it
was
worked
out
by
diplomatic
methods
and,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests
here,
perhaps,
someday,
compensation
would
be
worked
out
by
diplomatic
methods
now.
and,
now,
i'd
want
to
get
to
your
honor's
question
on
the
freeze
because
i
think
it
ties
in
with
it.
in
the
first
place,
the
freeze
is
not
an
absolute
freeze.
it's
a
freeze
subject
to
license.
if
we
worked
to
secure
a
judgment
in
this
case,
we
would
applied
to
the
treasury
department
and
we
would
seek
to
get
a
license.
and,
the
treasury
department
would
decide
in
determining,
in
the
light
of
its
then
existing
policy,
whatever
it
happened
to
be,
whether
it
would
give
us
a
license
on
that
or
not,
and
that
would
be
handled
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
was
the
policy
the
day
was
--
the
day
the
letter
was
written.
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
be
the
policy
the
day
that
this
court
hands
down
a
judgment
in
our
favor
or
whether
it
will
be
the
policy
2
years
from
now,
5
years
from
now,
10
years
from
now,
or
whenever
an
application
for
a
license
is
made,
because
it
is
a
policy
question
the
treasury
department
will
have
to
determine
policy
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
exist
at
that
time.
the
second
answer
is
that
our
previous
experience
has
been,
in
the
case
of
blocked
funds,
that
when
blocked
funds
are
accumulated,
and
this
would
be
the
beginning
or
at
least
part
of
the
beginning
of
an
accumulation,
it
has
been
the
experience
in
the
past
that
those
blocked
funds
have
frequently
been
used
in
the
future,
5
years,
10
years,
in
the
case
of
the
soviet
union,
25
years
later,
to
work
out
some
sort
of
a
diplomatic
settlement,
whereby,
all
american
property
owners
receive
that
--
receive
some
sort
of
a
share
of
the
funds
--
the
blocked
funds
that
had
accumulated.
perhaps
that
will
happen
in
this
case
if
we
prevail
but,
if
we
don't
prevail,
it
means
that
those
funds
presumably
will
belong
to
farr,
whitlock
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
there
are
many,
many
aspects
of
the
freeze
which
could
be
discussed
and
which,
if
it
ever
becomes
appropriate,
will
be
discussed
but
i
don't
think
that
the
freeze
makes
the
matter
moot.
it
may
raise
some
question
as
to
how
soon,
if
ever,
we
will
realize
the
fruits
of
a
victory
we
may
win
here
and
it
may
take
a
long
time
and
it
may
be
hard
for
us
to
get
the
fruits
of
those
victory
--
of
that
victory.
but,
the
alternative
is
to
hand
the
money
over
to
farr,
whitlock
and,
that,
we
believe,
is
not
justified
on
the
record
here
and
it
is
not
going
to
be
affected
by
the
freeze
one
way
or
the
other.
those
frozen
funds
may
someday
come
in
handy
and,
as
i
say,
in
connection
with
the
diplomatic
settlement
or
some
other
kind
of
settlement.
i
really
don't
know.
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
should
like,
in
the
few
minutes
i
have,
to
discuss
some
of
the
points
raised
by
mr.
seymour
and,
particularly,
this
very
troublesome
problem
of
what
is
international
law.
it
is
true
that
the
--
this
court
held
in
paquete
habana
that
international
law
is
part
of
the
law
of
this
land
but,
of
course,
we
must
recognize
a
very
essential
difference.
in
determining
what
is
the
law
of
this
land,
this
court
has
the
final
word
and
what
this
court
says
is
the
law
of
the
united
states.
but,
unfortunately,
this
court
cannot
make
the
same
pronouncements
as
to
what
is
international
law
and,
therefore,
a
decision
by
this
court
saying
that
compensation,
for
example,
is
required
by
international
law
doesn't
make
it
international
law,
with
all
due
respect
to
this
court,
because
international
law,
as
almost
universally
defined,
is
the
practice
of
nations.
and,
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
to
mr.
seymour
and
with
all
due
respect
to
all
of
the
very
voluminous
and
scholarly
briefs
that
have
been
written
here,
there
is
nothing
in
those
briefs
to
justify
any
conclusion
that
these
decrees
were
a
violation
of
the
established
practice
of
nations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
look
at
history,
we
find
that,
at
least
since
1917,
the
established
practice
of
nations
has
been
--
have
been
to
confiscate
and
to
nationalize
the
property
both
of
citizens
and
of
aliens
without
paying
compensation
for
it
and,
frequently,
in
a
retaliatory
and
discriminatory
fashion.
now,
this
may
be
very
sad
and
it
may
be
very
unfortunate
and
we
may
all
regret
it,
and
it
may
be
that
all
of
the
commentators
say
this
ought
not
to
be
allowed,
but
if
we
look
at
practice,
it
is
what
happens.
and,
we
cannot
change
the
practice
and
we
cannot
change
the
law
merely
by
saying
that
the
law
is
otherwise.
in
the
paquete
habana,
which
mr.
seymour
cites,
the
court
warned
against
this
and
it
said,
in
looking
at
international
law,
we
must
be
careful
about
the
views
of
learned
commentators
who
tell
us
what
they
think
the
law
ought
to
be
because
that
does
not
make
international
law.
we
have,
today,
i
think
112
nations
in
the
united
nations.
when
grotius
wrote,
i
suppose
there
were
10
or
15
or
20
nations
which
might
have
a
sufficiently
high
degree
of
civilization
so
that
they
had
a
judicial
system.
today,
we
have
10
times
as
many.
i
look
forward,
as
much
as
mr.
seymour
does
and
as
much
as
everybody
else
does,
to
the
day
when
we
can
say
that
there
is
an
established
body
of
international
law
with
respect
to
these
very
troublesome
questions
but
we
haven't
got
to
that
point.
i
hope
we
will,
but
we
aren't
there.
and,
the
established
practice
of
nations
give
no
support
and
none
of
the
authorities
--
none
of
the
briefs
that
had
been
submitted
in
this
case
show
any
support
for
the
doctrines
that
mr.
seymour
has
so
eloquently
argued
here
for
today.
i
would
agree
with
him,
perhaps,
on
the
question
of
policy,
but
i
cannot
agree
with
him
that
there
is
any
such
law
and
all
of
the
law
review
articles
and
all
of
the
resolutions
by
the
american
law
institute
and
all
of
the
articles
and
comments
by
learned
scholars,
for
whom
i
have
the
greatest
respect,
do
not
make
international
law
in
the
face
of
a
well-established
practice
to
the
contrary.
now,
what
do
we
have
here?
i
disagree.
i
wasn't
fortunate
enough
to
be
at
athens
but,
from
what
i
read
in
the
papers
and
from
what
mr.
ryan
wrote
to
me,
and
it's
cited
in
my
brief,
what
happened
was
that,
on
one
day,
the
conference
of
lawyers,
which
of
course
was
not
a
legislative
body
and
had
no
power
to
make
law
anyhow,
said
that
there
should
be
compensation
for
confiscated
property
and,
the
next
day,
they
revoked
it
and
said
this
requires
further
res
--
further
discussion.
that
isn't
the
recognition
of
a
rule
of
law,
even
if
it
were
a
legislative
body.
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
the
united
nations
confronted
with
the
very
problem,
that
also
is
not
a
legislative
body
incidentally,
confronted
with
the
very
problem
of
making
compensation
for
a
nationalized
property
split
30
nations
voting
one
way,
30
nations
voting
another
way,
and
33
nations
abstaining.
does
this
--
and
some
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
it
would've
made
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same,
sir.
it
would
not
have
established
a
fairly
uniform
practice
among
the
nations.
now,
what
the
percentage
point
is,
i
don't
know.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
suppose
that
if
we
got
to
90,
and
it
would
then
--
i
would
then
have
to
look
and
see
what
the
nations
were.
and,
if
the
dissenting
nations
were
chad
--
i
don't
want
to
mention
any
nations.
i
don't
want
to
make
anybody
angry.
if
the
dissenting
nations
had
a
total
population
of
5%
of
the
population
of
the
world
and
the
other
nations
had
95%,
i
suppose
we
could
call
something
the
established
practice.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
cert
--
no
resolution
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
resolution
by
the
united
nations
could
make
international
law
in
any
event
because
it
is
not
a
legislative
body.
but,
if
this
court
holds
that
international
law
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
our
country
and
if
there
is
some
subject
on
which
there
is
a
well
established
principle
of
international
law,
and,
these
days,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
can
find
very
many
of
them,
even
free
passage
of
the
sea
is,
apparently,
not
as
well-established
as
it
was
50
years
ago,
then
i
suppose
that,
under
the
paquete
habana,
this
court
is
as
much
bound
by
international
law
as
it
is
by
any
other
domestic
law,
at
least
that's
what
the
--
what
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
it
didn't
want
to
be
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
obviously,
this
law
could
not
--
this
court
could
not
make
the
law
for
the
world.
this
law
could
--
this
--
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
this
court
could
not
decide
what
is
international
law
and,
if
this
court
decided
that
it
tha
--
did
not
wish
to
be
bound
by
international
law,
then,
presumably,
it
would
not
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
quite
possible
also.
i
sup
--
well,
i
don't
know
whether
congress
and
the
executive
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
this
court,
i
am
sure,
could
not
establish
international
law.
i'd
suppose
if
there
is
to
be,
at
least
in
the
present
state
of
our
civilization,
any
international
law
at
all,
it
must
be
an
international
common
law
because
we
don't
have
any
legislatures
that
can
determine
these
things.
certainly,
the
legislature
of
the
united
states
would
not
be
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
there
was,
but
we
passed
that
and
i
think,
in
many
respects
at
least,
we
have
it.
my
time
is
up,
but
i
would
just
like
to
repeat
what
i
said
that
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
justification,
however
vigorously
and
with
whatever
great
sincerity
and
without
--
however
many
footnotes
there
are.
there
is
no
justification
for
any
finding
that
there
is
any
international
law
on
this
subject.
the
nations
of
the
world
are
split
wide-open
and
most
of
the
nations,
or
at
least
most
of
the
people
in
most
of
the
nations
of
the
world,
engage
in
wide-spread
nationalizations
frequently,
i
regret
to
say,
without
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it's
a
very
difficult
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it's
a
very
difficult
and
baffling
question
and
it's
treated
in
the
last
footnote
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
as
i
say,
the
last
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
raises
this
question
and
it
raises
a
--
really
a
horrifying
prospect.
if
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
to
be
dropped
and
if
this,
then,
is
determined
by
erie
against
tompkins
and
the
klaxon
case
so
that
every
state
is
going
to
decide
for
itself
what
is
international
law
and
determining
the
effect
of
foreign
decrees,
we
are
likely
to
have
50
doctrines,
or
at
least
the
possibility
of
50
doctrines,
plus
one,
namely,
the
federal
system
in
cases
arising
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
one
of
the
cuba
cases
of
course
did
arise.
and,
the
possibility
of
that,
i
think,
probably
was
what
caused
this
last
footnote.
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
suggest
that,
and
i
read
from
that
last
footnote,
on
the
other
hand
--
after
quoting
erie
against
tompkins
and
klaxon,
it
said
“on
the
other
hand,
certain
cases
have
indicated
that
internation
law
is
part
of
the
body
of
federal
law."
for
our
purpose
here,
we
don't
have
to
resolve
these
questions
because
it
appears
that
the
new
york
law
is
the
same
as
the
federal
law
and,
in
that,
i
agree
and
i
think
mr.
seymour
agrees
also
but
we
just
disagree
on
what
that
law
is.
now,
i
think
it's
a
very
troublesome
problem
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
new
york
law
clearly
has
an
act
of
state
doctrine.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
specifically
refused
to
follow
this
decision.
in
mann
against
petrolera,
which
is
quoted
in
my
brief,
and
it
said
that
if
there
--
they
were
discussing,
at
that
point,
property
which
was
located
in
new
york
and,
therefore,
under
new
york
--
well-established
new
york
law,
it
was
not
affected
by
the
expropriation
decree.
but,
the
court
said
"if
this
property
had
ever
been
in
cuba,
it
would
have
been
nationalized
even
though,
later,
were
brought
to
the
united
states"
and
it
said
the
usual
formulation
is
here,
sabbatino.
and
--
so,
the
court
--
courts
in
new
york,
at
least
insofar
as
we
have
any
decisions
in
new
york
on
this
question,
disapprove
of
the
sabbatino
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
difficult.
i
might
say
that,
in
drawing
my
complaint
here,
i
alleged
not
only
diversity
but
also
the
executive
power
of
the
president
over
--
of
the
--
that
is,
the
power
of
the
executive
branch
over
foreign
affairs
because
i
was
--
that,
as
i
alleged,
separation
of
powers
as
a
--
is
a
--
an
additional
ground
of
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
we
never
got
into
that
and
i'd
make
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
see
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
rests
on
constitutional
grounds
in
the
normal
sense.
now,
if
mr.
katzenbach's
position
is
a
correct
one,
and
of
course
i
agree
with
it,
then
it
may
well
be
that
we
will
ultimately
reach
the
decision,
which
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
in
this
case,
that
because,
as
i
say,
new
york
and
federal
law
are
the
same,
we
will
reach
the
decision
that
this
is
a
matter
which
is
within
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and,
therefore,
it
does
come
within
the
constitution
insofar
as
the
separation
of
powers
can
be
said
to
be,
in
any
event
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
well,
i
would
go
--
i
would
stop
before
that.
i
would
say,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
don't
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
get
there
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
put
it
the
other
way,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
if
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applies,
then
we
don't
ever
--
ever
have
to
get
to
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
an
issue
of
(inaudible)
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it's
easier
that
way,
your
honor.
it's
much
easier
because
the
act
of
state
doctrine
--
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
lot
clearer
than
international
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
but
it
is
in
the
new
york
law.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
suggestion
to
the
contrary
in
the
new
york
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
seymour
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
he
says
so
but
there's
no
authority
to
support
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
there
are
only
three
cases
and,
i
--
in
the
salimoff
case,
the
court
says,
and
i
find
it
hard
to
find
language
that
--
that's
clearer,
that
says
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
this
is
silent,
your
honor.
may
i
just
have
--
i
know
my
time
is
long
up
but,
at
page
12
of
my
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
the
courts
of
our
--
of
one
independent
government
will
not
sit
in
judgment
upon
the
validity
of
the
acts
of
another
done
within
its
territory,
even
when
such
government
seizes
and
sells
the
property
of
an
american
citizen
