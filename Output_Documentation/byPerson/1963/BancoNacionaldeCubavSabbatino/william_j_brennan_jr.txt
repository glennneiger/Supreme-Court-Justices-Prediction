justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
bear
on
this
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
rabinowitz.
you're
not
arguing
either,
are
you
that
this
is
the
kind
of
subject
matter
which
the
constitution
commits
to
the
executive
and,
in
that
sense,
is
nonjusticiable?
in
other
words,
you're
not
arguing
that
this
is
a
matter
of
lack
of
power
in
the
judiciary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
where
is
this
money
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
an
escrow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
among?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
to
say,
to
accept
the
plaintiff's
title
and
decide
on
the
issue
of
conversion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
accept
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
plaintiff's
title
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
then
automatically
means,
i
expect,
that
the
plaintiff
wins
on
the
issue
of
conversion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
justice
clark
has
been
suggesting
is
if
we
can't
reach
the
defense,
why
shouldn't
the
court
throw
the
case
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
suppose
it
depends
on
the
theory.
if
as
you
--
i
understand
you
to
suggest
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
rule
of
positive
law,
then
i
expect
that
you'd
be
right.
we
--
the
plaintiff
would
be
entitled
to
a
judgment.
but
if
it's
merely
a
rule
of
abstention,
it
might
be
more
american
a
suggestion
that
if
we
can't
--
we're
going
to
abstain
from
deciding
the
defense,
then
we
ought
to
also
abstain
from
deciding
the
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
do
take
it
though,
you
would
say,
because
you
deny
the
existence
of
an
exception,
that
if
the
doctrine
is
one
of
a
positive
rule
of
law
then
it's
utterly
immaterial
whether
the
executive
tells
us
that
it's
like
or
not
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
it's
not
really
relevant
here
but,
just
out
of
curiosity,
mr.
rabinowitz,
the
united
states
has
seized
a
lot
of
property
of
cubans
in
the
united
states,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder,
do
the
cuban
courts
inquire
into
the
validity
of
that
seizure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
eliminates,
at
least
from
your
standpoint,
any
argument
that
this
is
a
political
question
in
the
sense
of
one
non-justiciable
because
without
judicial
power
to
deal
with?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
the
court
has
no
power
to
deal
with
this
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
attorney,
may
i
--
i'm
just
a
little
bothered
about
this
though.
i
appreciate
that,
in
this
case,
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
not
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
indeed,
you're
urging
that
we
do
apply
it.
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
decide
that,
in
any
instance
where
the
of
act
of
state
doctrine
is
applicable
that,
as
a
positive
rule
of
law,
the
judiciary
shall
not
deal
with
that
or
is
there
a
qualification
that,
on
some
occasions,
the
state
may
say
to
the
judiciary,
“we're
not
concerned.
if
the
court
wants
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
question,
the
court
may
do
it?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
may
be,
but
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
really
see
how
we
can
fail
the
deal
with
what's
suggested
by
bernstein
in
deciding
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
it's
a
judged-made
rule,
in
any
event,
we
may
shape
it
is
what
you're
telling
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
gather
--
would
you
go
this
far,
mr.
attorney
general,
in
an
appropriate
case,
maybe
this
is
one,
if
we
are
to
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
the
defense,
we
ought
then
to
say,
since
it
is
a
judge-fashioned
rule,
“well,
we
wouldn't
deal
with
half
a
case
and
so
we'll
complain
about
it,
too?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
in,
your
opinion,
mr.
katzenbach,
a
relationship
between
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
the
doctrine
sovereign
immunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
to
mean
that
here
if
judgment
and
conversion
is
to
go
for
the
plaintiff,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
cuba,
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose,
after
the
petitioner
prevails
here,
if
it
does,
on
your
ground,
then
the
petitioner
brings
an
action
against
whatever
bank
or
escrow
agreement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
get
the
money,
what
happens
then?
it
brings
us
a
brand
new
action
for
the
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
assuming
now
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
petitioner
here
prevails
and
gets
a
judgment
in
conversion.
as
i
understand
it,
the
$175,000
is
now
in
the
hands
of
an
escrowee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
suppose
the
escrowee
would
then
turn
it
over
to
the
plaintiff,
although,
under
the
terms
of
the
escrow
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
agreement,
it
belongs
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can't
even
get
a
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not
be
subject,
in
the
hands
of
c.a.v.,
to
the
freeze
order
wouldn't
it
--
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it's
a
cuban
corporation?
is
the
c.a.v.
a
cuban
corporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
williams?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
did
not
have
the
plaintiff
we
do
have
or
the
petitioner
here,
but
some
bona
fide
purchaser
of
these
papers,
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
draft
and
so
forth,
i
gather,
you'd
be
making
neither
of
the
arguments
you've
been
giving.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say,
but
if
--
my
point
is
your
argument
is
based
on
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
particular
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rabinowitz,
on
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical,
how
short
of
making
the
act
of
state
doctrine
a
question
of
separation
of
powers
and,
therefore,
the
question
of
federal
constitutional
law?
can
the
federal
courts
reach
the
decision
in
the
new
york
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
though
in
your
argument
yesterday,
in
the
colloquy
you
and
i
had,
that
you
disclaimed
that
basis
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
your
argument
really
adds
up
to
this,
doesn't
it,
that,
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
the
narrowest
possible
ground
of
decision
is
that,
indeed,
no
international
rule
of
law
has
been
proved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
if
that's
the
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
the
fact,
we
don't
have
to
reach
act
of
state
or
anything
else,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
assuming
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
it
so
easy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rabinowitz,
i
still
don't
understand
why,
if
you
are
right
that
there
is
no
international
rule
of
law
requiring
--
no
established
rule
of
law
requiring
compens
--
compensation
upon
such
confiscation,
if
that
is
so,
why
that
wouldn't
dispose
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
