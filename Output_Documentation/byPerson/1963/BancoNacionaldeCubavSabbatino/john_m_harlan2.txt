is
banco
an
instrumentality
of
the
cuban
government?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
eighth
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
dispute
about
the
effectiveness
of
that
appropriation
as
such,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
this
has
not
been
a
contested
issue
anywhere
in
the
litigation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
effective
appropriation
within
the
territorial
limits
of
cuba
on
these
sugar.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
the
consent
or
non-consent
of
the
--
or
assertion
or
non-assertion
by
the
executive
as
to
whether
this
should
be
--
this
case
should
be
justi
--
adjudicated
or
not
as
an
immaterial
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
rather
academic
anyway
because,
even
if
the
bernstein
exception
is
an
exception
here,
the
government,
in
this
court,
is
saying
that
they
do
assert.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
we
--
we've
been
told
that
cuba
has
setup
a
socialist
economy
and
i
suppose
this,
by
definition,
implies
it
could
a
good
deal
of
involvement
of
the
state
in
--
but,
in
a
capitalist
economy,
are
thought
to
be
private
enterprise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
significance,
if
any,
do
you
credit
to
the
fact
that
the
state
department,
itself,
has
not
questioned
the
right
of
this
plaintiff
pursuant
to
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
assume
that
the
attorney
general
was
speaking
for
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
court
should
be
concluded
on
that
issue
by
the
attitude
of
the
state
department
or
by
the
attitude
of
the
executive.
we
--
the
courts
are
not
going
to
pause
in
the
negative
inquiries
to
the
degree
of
platonic
relationship
between
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
english
courts
do
not
enumerate
to
get
the
statement
from
