justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
just
dismiss
the
decision,
if
the
court
says
“dismissed.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
we
don't
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
while
certainly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
--
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
cuba,
under
cuban
law,
this
property
went
to
a
certain
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
got
to
de
--
follow
that
as
the
law
governing
that
ownership
of
that
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
we
still
have
a
duty,
under
the
law,
to
decide
the
lawsuit
on
that
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
and
verify
my
assertion
is
wholly
as
your
position?
do
i
understand
that
you
adopt
and
say
that
a
positive
rule
of
law,
the
one
that
has
been
and
should
be
followed,
is
the
statement
made
by
chief
justice
fuller
in
the
underhill
and
hernandez
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
that's
the
reason
that,
if
you
do
have
any
distinction
in
your
definition
of
what
you
say
this
positive
rule
of
law
is,
i'd
like
to
know
it
because
i
understand
it
to
be
this,
what
you're
saying.
when
a
case
comes
in
the
court
by
a
government
recognized
by
this
country
has
it
not
acted
some
kind
of
a
law
and
taking
some
kind
of
administrative
action
that
reposes
title
to
property
and
somebody,
even
itself,
that
the
courts
shall
not
look
behind
that
act
and
shall
act
in
that
case
on
the
premise
that
the
property
belong
to
that
person
in
whom
the
title
has
been
reposed
by
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
being
the
case
here,
as
i
understand,
your
argument
is
if
we
should
decide
this
case,
whether
we
decide
it
one
question
or
another,
or
dismiss
it,
whatever
is
done
has
to
be
done
on
the
basis
that
the
government
of
cuba
owned
this
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
can't
--
using
non-legal
word,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
this
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
that
not
mean
that,
here,
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
cuba
owned
this
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
as
i
understand
it,
you
also
say
that
we
have
no
--
under
the
rule
it
has
been
and
is
here,
that
you
think
it
should
remain.
it's
not
up
to
us
to
say
“we're
not
going
to
decide
it
--
the
case
because
we
don't
like
the
way
the
title
came
into
this
people's
hands.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
concretely,
this
is
being
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
any
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
answer
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
congress
has
acted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
even
though
it
was
cuban
property
or
whoever
property
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
that's
opposing
it
has
to
wait
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
other
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
would
result,
would
it
not,
to
a
record
saying
that
the
judicial
department
is
the
department
of
government
that
has
the
power
to
determine
whether
a
foreign
nation
shall
be
allowed
to
file
a
suit
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
department
--
the
executive
department,
legislative
department,
state
department,
and
all
of
the
others
thought
(inaudible)
would
be
contrary
for
them
to
policies.
would
--
could
the
court
still
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
--
it
might
say
that
it
meant
to
go
only
this
far,
but
it
did
not
want
to
add
what
it
might
say
was
additional
international
insults,
one
would
say,
and
the
other
say
they
couldn't
come
into
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
may
be
right.
it's
just
a
rather
eloquent
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
60
--
suppose
60%
had
voted
one
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
40%
in
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
75
had
voted
one
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
90.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that'd
be
an
international
law
that
bounds
us
whether
we
wanted
to
be
bound
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
an
international
law
if
it
didn't
bind
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
didn't
want
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
this
court
make
it
so
as
it
didn't
want
to
be
in,
and
that
becomes
so,
by
joining
in
some
kind
of
a
union
that
meant
that
you
did
have
the
power
to
make
laws
that
are
binding
on
the
world?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
correct?
this
court
might
decide
it,
but
congress
and
the
executive
might
decide
otherwise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
saying,
even
as
far
as
--
are
you
going
far
enough
to
show
this
court
has
a
right
to
establish
an
international
common
law
that
binds
all
the
nations
of
the
world?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
finding
something
--
by
finding
something
other
than
that
the
government,
itself,
has
a
duty
to
accept
mandates
as
binding
on
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
there
was
a
rather
vigorous
opposition
in
this
country
to
having
even
a
national
common
law.
