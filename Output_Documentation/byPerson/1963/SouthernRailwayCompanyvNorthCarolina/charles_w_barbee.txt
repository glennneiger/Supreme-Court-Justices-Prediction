mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first,
if
i
may,
to
clarify
what
is
possibly
some
misunderstanding
on
the
factual
matter
concerning
the
sleeper.
mr.
ginnane
yesterday
in
outlining
that
referred
to
it
as
being
a
sleeper
between
raleigh
and
washington
which
it
is.
however,
the
--
as
the
situation
existed
at
the
time
of
hearing
and
at
the
time
of
hearing
in
the
court
below
and
before
the
commission
below,
it
was
a
new
york
sleeper.
it
was
taken
off
for
a
short
while
and
before
the
court's
the
decision
came
down
and
then
was
put
back
upon,
but
no
longer
taken
to
new
york,
it
stops
in
washington
d.c.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
known
as
the
raleigh
new
york
car,
you
could
board
in
raleigh
or
durham
or
any
point
between
raleigh
and
north,
and
stay
on
that
very
same
car
until
you
got
to
new
york
city
or
any
place
in
between.
that
is
one
of
the
principles
if
not
the
principle
public
convenience
and
necessity
afforded
by
the
service
of
these
trains
between
goldsboro
and
greensboro
and
i
was
happy
to
hear
colonel
joyner,
as
i
understood
him
to
concede
that,
because
the
question,
it
had
been
contested
in
brief
that
the
court
below
made
a
finding
which
was
beyond
it's
function
and
that
that's
the
type
of
finding
that
the
commission
should
make,
but
i
think
the
record
when
viewed
as
a
whole
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
that
is
the
principle
public
convenience
and
necessity.
as
testified
to
by
a
great
may
witnesses,
we
referred
to
some
30
places
in
the
record
where
that
is
one
of
the
principle
conveniences.
it
is
very
convenient
and
especially
in
--
for
those
people
who
won't
have
a
days
work
in
new
york
as
many
of
the
professors
at
duke
university
and
members
of
the
office
of
ordnance
research
located
at
duke,
testified
they
frequently
having
meetings
in
washington
or
in
new
york,
they
find
it
convenient
the
board
the
train
there
in
durham
on
the
afternoon
around
5:30
or
6
o'clock
and
without
having
to
move
they
can
get
off
the
car
in
new
york
the
next
morning
around,
8
o'clock
i
believe
it
is
and
complete
their
day's
work
and
board
the
train
that
afternoon,
after
the
workday
is
completed
and
return,
arrive
back
in
the
raleigh
or
durham
the
next
morning
around
7
o'
clock.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
i
believe
it
does
mr.
justice.
--
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
from
raleigh,
to
get
on
that
of
course
from
durham
you
have
to
go
by
car
or
bus.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
it's
about
25
miles.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
it's
about
a
35
minute
bus
ride
i
believe.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
i
believe
there
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
yes
sir
there
is.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
that
very
same
train
that
affords
that
service
--
well
this
raleigh
new
york
sleeper
to
raleigh.
to
washington
--
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
yes
sir,
a
great
many.
incidentally
it's
also
important
and
borders
on
the
necessity,
absolute
necessity
for
this
rail
travel
in
times
of
extreme
weather.
as
testified
to
by
a
good
many
people
in
the
record,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
they
find
it
necessary
and
when
we
refer
to
public
convenience
and
the
necessity
we
don't
--
it
doesn't
mean
absolutely
imperative,
the
definition
is
given
in
seaboard
air
line
railway
company
versus
commonwealth,
a
virginia
case
reported
in
71,
southeast
second,
page
146
and
refer
to
page
on
27
of
our
brief.
it
is
necessary
if
it
appears
reasonably
requisite,
“is
suited
and
tends
to
promote
the
accommodation
of
the
party”
and
many
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
testify
that
it
was
much
more
convenient.
for
example
patients
at
duke
hospital
who
had
to
come
by
some
stretcher
service
and
others
who
had
been
advised
by
their
doctors
not
to
fly
and
others
who
didn't
like
or
didn't
want
to
ride
automobiles
or
for
some
reason
could
not.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
it
is
part
of
the
university
and
it
is
some
kind
of
a
special
hospital
in
some
respects.
they
have
a
good
many
people
who
come
to
duke
to
take
the
rice
diet
and
they
have
a
lot
of
the
specialized
treatments
there,
like
most
hospitals
do
i
guess,
but
it
is
a
big
hospital
and
there
are
a
lot
of
patients
there
from
the
north
and
the
west.
there
mr.
battle
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
several
instances
in
which
the
southern
had
been
permitted
in
the
past
to
discontinue
passenger
trains
on
this
line
when
requested
and
the
state
has
permitted
them
to
do
that,
everyone
accept
this
last
one.
and
the
state
has
asked
them,
as
in
this
case,
has
not
permitted
them
to
or
did
not.
they
entered
their
order,
that
in
this
case
in
its
early
days
referring
to
the
fact
that
this
was
the
very
last
passenger,
rail
passenger
service
between
these
two
points
and
would
leave
some
of
the
communities
without
any
rail
passenger
service
of
any
kind.
and
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
southern
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
could
not
recall,
but
five
cities
in
the
entire
united
states
that
did
not
have
some
form
of
a
rail
passenger
service
and
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
yes
sir,
70,000
people.
the
north
carolina
commission
has
gone
further
than
just
allowing
them
to
discontinue
all
of
their
trains
but
one.
there
have
been
in
the
past
ten
years
six
freight
rate
increases
allowed
by
the
north
carolina
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
every
single
one
of
which
the
deficit
resulting
from
passenger
train
operations
was
taken
into
consideration
as
a
factor
in
allowing
the
freight
rates
to
be
increased,
but
that
is
a
fact
which
was
stipulated
to
in
the
record,
page
361
i
believe
it
is.
the
13
a
(2)
requires
two
things.
it
requires
that
there
be
not
only
a
finding
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
at
present
or
future
permit
of
the
discontinuance,
but
it
also
requires
that
the
finding
based
on
substantial
evidence
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
train
would
result
in
a
burden
which
is
undue
and
unjust.
now
this
operation
between
greensboro
and
goldsboro,
the
passenger
operation,
the
$630,000
figure
was
referred
to
by
mr.
ginnane
yesterday
as
having
been
arrived
at
by
a
felicitous
computation
made
by
the
court
below.
in
that
regard
and
in
reply
to
that
i
am
referring
to
page
or
in
volume
number
two
of
the
record,
on
page
374,
and
i
won't
--
the
testimony
of
mr.
gleeson
who
is
the
chief
statistician
for
the
southern
railroad
and
who
himself
by
his
testimony
at
that
point
on
cross
examination
establishes
that
the
$630,000
figure
would
be
a
good
estimate
of
the
freight
profits,
net
freight
profits
after
taxes
for
the
year
1960
and
that
the
method
of
estimating
that
income
gives
them
a
good
estimate.
it
was
not
--
in
fact
the
court
below
did
not
even
purport
to
make
a
calculation,
it
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
calculation
currently
was
made
from
a
comparison
of
the
average
density
on
this
line
with
that
of
the
overall
southern
railway
operations.
so
we
submit
the
$630,000
figure
is
not
one
that
was
computed
by
the
court
below
but
was
established
by
southern
own
witness
and
the
fact
that
the
hearing
examiner
below
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
failed
to
take
that
into
consideration,
was
the
type
of
gross
error
that
entitled
the
court
below
to
set
aside
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
order.
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
the
railroad
contended
that
their
loss
on
this
line
per
year
was
$117,000.
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
the
loss
was
$90,000
per
year.
the
company
wide
net
operations
net
railway
operations
in
1960,
after
taxes
were
$36
million.
after
paying
all
fixed
charges,
their
net
income
from
all
operations
was
$30
million.
they
paid
of
that
in
dividends
$21
million.
they
put
the
rest
in
surplus
which
brought
their
surplus
as
of
1960
to
$343
million
over
a
third
of
$1
billion,
as
compared
with
a
loss,
all
these
figures
are
a
bit
after
taxes
and
the
$90,000
figure
found
the
examiner
reveals
i
think
clearly
and
the
results
inescapably
an
absolute,
should
be
an
absolute
finding
that
this
--
if
it
is
a
burden
could
not
under
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
said
to
be
unjust
or
undue.
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
i
believe
that's
true,
i
believe
--
mr.
charles
w.
barbee,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
believe
that's
true.
as
i
understand
the
statements
by
the
courts,
they
have
to
balance
one
against
the
other
and
that's
what
we
think
that
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
case
failed
to
do
proper
because
as
the
court
has
said
in
many
cases
where
a
regulation
which
is
principally
traditionally
of
that
of
the
state
and
has
come
to
be
authorized
by
the
congress
for
the
federal
government
to
do
so,
it
should
be
exercised
only.
if
the
justification
for
it
clearly
appears,
and
we
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
whole
record,
taken
as
a
whole
that,
that
justification
does
not
clearly
appear
and
that
in
this
case
the
court
below
was
correct
in
setting
aside
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
