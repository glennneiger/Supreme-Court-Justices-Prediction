mr.
william
t.
joyner
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
expect
to
discuss
the
substantial
quality
of
the
evidence,
which
supports
the
judgment
conclusion
of
the
commission,
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
the
discontinuance
of
the
trains
in
question.
the
commission
below,
a
court
and
each
party
filing
a
brief
has
i
think
cited
the
case
in
colorado
against
the
united
states
as
stating
clearly
the
basic
law
applicable
here.
that
was
a
case
involving
the
discontinuance
of
a
line,
intrastate
line
of
railroad
under
section
18
of
the
transportation
act,
but
the
court
there
said
in
substance
that
the
substantial
problem
was
the
balancing
of
the
needs
of
the
community
and
individuals
in
a
community
against
the
burden
on
commerce
and
the
commission
is
to
balance
those
needs.
the
commission
in
this
case
has
balanced
the
needs
and
has
made
its
decision.
i
think
we'll
also
agree
that
the
point
then
presented
is
the
question
as
to
whether
the
evidence,
the
relevant
evidence
is
such
that
a
reasonable
mind
might
accept
it
as
adequate
to
support
the
conclusion.
that's
a
consolidated
edison
case
which
they
cite
and
i
accept
that
as
a
governing
principle.
on
the
question
of
the
burden,
the
facts
are
undisputed,
that
is
the
question
of
the
loss
mr.
ginnane
has
stated
that,
there
is
a
burden
which
the
commission
found
exceeded
$90,000
per
year,
but
that
would
be
saved
by
taking
the
trains
off.
may
i
comment
here
that
the
figures
which
are
recited
and
the
figures
which
we
quote
as
to
money
and
losses,
expenses
are
computed
on
the
out
of
pocket
expenses,
not
the
way
the
expenses
for
the
national
figures,
passenger
figures
are
computed,
there
is
nothing
in
there
for
maintenance
of
right
of
way,
nothing
for
overhead.
it's
wages
of
train
crew,
cost
of
fuel,
oiling
and
grease,
the
money
that
it
costs
to
turn
the
wheels
over.
and
as
mr.
ginnane
said
yesterday,
the
total
passenger
receipts
are
less
than
one-forth
of
the
wages
of
the
train
crew.
but
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument,
i
emphasize
the
number
of
passengers
and
the
diminishing
passenger
travel,
because
it
indicates
that
the
passengers
are
leaving
the
railroad,
and
that
indicates
that
there
are
available
other
adequate
means
of
transportation
and
that
people
deliberately
choose
those
means
rather
than
the
railroad,
and
that
is
in
itself
substantial
evidence
of
the
lack
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
of
the
lack
of
the
need
for
the
travel.
i
think
a
most
significant
figure
with
respect
to
my
portion
of
the
argument
is
the
breakdown
of
the
figure
given
yesterday
that
the
passengers
had
diminished
in
12
years
from
an
average
of
77
per
trip
to
an
average
of
20,
but
the
breakdown
of
the
20
or
stating
another
average
is
very
important.
i
suggest
that
one
of
the
most
significant
things
in
this
case
is
the
undisputed
fact
that
the
average
passenger
per
train
mile,
the
average
of
passengers
per
train
mile
is
just
seven.
that
this
train
which
has
a
combination
coach,
a
day
coach
and
all
the
time
a
pullman
most
of
the
time,
on
the
average
mile
of
haul
has
an
average
of
seven
passengers.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
on
the
two
parts,
it
takes
merely
four
hours.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
129
miles,
but
as
i'm
going
to
get
to
next
in
my
argument,
the
real
point
in
controversy
is
the
point
of
durham,
because
when
we
begin
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
d-u-r-h-a-m,
the
city
of
durham
north
carolina.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
because
when
we
begin
to
analyze
and
get
ready
to
balance
the
convenience
and
necessity,
i
suggest
that
we
look
at
the
passengers
and
how
they
evidenced
the
need
what
their
travel
is
and
what
would
be
their
situation
if
the
train
is
taken
off.
now
that
is
stated
very
clearly
indeed
in
the
brief
of
appellees
and
they
say
on
page
22
of
that
brief,
the
principal
public
convenience
presently
affected
by
the
trains
arises
from
the
interconnecting
service
at
greensboro
with
the
north-south
trains
on
southern's
main
line,
so
as
to
furnish
convenient
overnight
sleeper
service
to
new
york
and
other
east
coast
cities
is
inescapable
if
consideration
is
given
to
the
entire
record.
the
evidence
on
this
part
is
clear.
it
is
undisputed
and
it
is
shown
at
no
less
than
30
places
in
the
record.
we
concede
that.
i
think
at
this
time
it
might
be
well
for
me
to
refer
again
to
the
map
that
was
before
the
court
yesterday,
it's
in
volume
one
of
the
transcript,
page
79.
i
think
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
have
that
map
as
i
discussed
the
convenience
and
necessity.
i
will
argue
that
the
convenience
and
the
necessity
is
almost
demonstrated
by
the
map
itself.
from
greensboro
to
goldsboro,
and
that
is
the
line
in
question,
greensboro
is
on
the
main
line
of
the
southern
and
it's
129
miles
to
goldsboro.
it's
approximately
55
miles
to
durham
as
you
go
east
from
greensboro
and
durham
is
--
well
north
carolina,
one
of
it's
largest
cities,
it's
a
large
educational
center,
it's
a
thriving
community.
from
durham
it's
26
miles
to
raleigh
making
81
miles,
raleigh
is
the
capital
of
the
state,
and
to
goldsboro
it's
129
miles.
now
in
this
proceeding
there
was
no
passenger
who
complained
of
service,
who
said
that
he
desired
service
east
of
raleigh.
i
take
it,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
and
i
think
it
is,
there
was
no
complaint
by
any
passenger
from
raleigh
and
there
was
no
complaint
by
any
person
seeking
to
use
the
service
east
of
durham.
i
will
comment
in
a
few
minutes
on
why
that's
true.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
complaint
for
durham.
it
is
true
that
the
pullman
is
put
on
in
raleigh,
but
the
durham
passengers
are
the
only
ones
that
testified
as
to
their
use
or
need.
if
you
look
at
that
map
i
think
it
will
become
reasonably
apparent
why
that
is
true.
at
raleigh
there
is
a
train
connection
with
the
mainline
of
the
seaboard
air
line
railway.
the
seaboard
runs
from
new
york
to
miami
and
the
schedules
in
the
record
show
fast
and
very
adequate
service.
they
have
six
trains
each
way
each
day.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
the
seaboard
at
raleigh.
now
the
seaboard
at
raleigh,
raleigh
is
exactly
26
miles
from
durham,
there
are
two
paved
highways
leading
from
raleigh
to
durham
as
is
shown
by
another
map.
one
of
those
paved
highways
is
a
four-lane
highway.
there
are
frequent
bus
schedules.
the
record
shows
there
are
15
buses
each
way,
each
day
between
raleigh
and
durham
and
the
record
also
shows
that
those
buses
have
a
running
time
of
approximately
35
minutes,
it's
a
35
minutes
bus
ride
from
durham
to
raleigh.
it
would
be
a
little
less
than
that
by
private
automobile.
so
any
passenger
in
durham
is
within
35
minutes
from
service
that
raleigh
has
found
adequate,
because
there
is
no
protest
from
raleigh,
any
raleigh
passengers
and
time
wise
they
are
no
further
from
raleigh
than
is
the
average
one
in
any
city
in
the
united
states.
but
we
go
to
durham,
now
if
you'll
follow
the
map
up
to
durham,
one
significant
thing
about
durham,
and
i
hope
to
be
get
this
in
my
argument,
durham
is
served
by
a
five
railroads
as
is
shown
by
that
map,
the
durham
and
southern,
the
norfolk
and
southern,
the
norfolk
and
western,
the
seaboard
air
line
and
by
the
southern.
none
of
the
five
has
passenger
train
except
the
southern.
durham
has
a
plentitude
of
great
service,
a
great
deal
of
freight
service.
it
has
little
railroad
passenger
service
and
witnesses
testified
that
they
use
the
pullman.
i'll
comment
on
that,
that
every
witness
who
complained
about
lack
of
transportation
was
a
pullman
passenger,
was
a
pullman
passenger
destined
for
points
north,
was
a
pullman
passenger,
making
the
connection
at
greensboro
is
the
train
38
to
go
to
washington
and
points
north
of
washington.
now
between
durham
and
greensboro,
if
you
follow
that
map,
there
is
ample
bus
service.
there
are
15
buses
each
way,
each
day
between
durham
and
greensboro.
the
running
time
of
those
buses
is
from
two
hours
and
five
minutes
for
local
buses
to
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
for
through
buses.
again
there
are
two
paved
highways
paralleling
that
road.
there
is
an
original
paved
highway
that
followed
the
railroad
and
there
are
four
lines,
there's
a
four-lane
highway
from
durham
to
greensboro,
an
hour
twenty
minutes
by
express
bus.
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a
bus
leaving
durham
at
precisely
the
same
time
that
this
pullman
leaves
durham,
and
it
gets
to
greensboro
and
has
thirty
eight
minutes
in
which
to
connect
with
the
same
train
that
this
pullman
is
now
put
on,
taken
off,
the
bus
can
be
taken.
another
significant
thing
about
the
testimony
of
those
passengers,
because
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
no
sir,
your
honor,
four
hours
i
meant
from
goldsboro
to
greensboro.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
but
as
i
say
there
is
no
complaint
beyond
durham
and
i
think
we
can
simplify
that
durham
is
the
contesting
point.
now
from
durham
to
greensboro
by
train
takes
approximately
an
hour,
i
think
it's
an
hour
and
55
minutes
for
one
train
and
an
hour
and
45
for
another.
there
are
two
flag
stops,
one
stop
that
they
may
go
in
one
direction
that
they
don't
make
in
the
other.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
yes
sir
i
think
--
i'm
sure
that
is
something
of
that,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
facts
and
i
expect
the
court
will
hear
about
that
from
the
other
side.
the
permission
--
mr.
william
t.
joyner
yes
sir,
there
was
testimony
on
that.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
the
nature
of
the
testimony
and
the
commission
found
that,
that
testimony
is
supporting
it,
that
the
railroad
had
made
efforts
to
get
the
passengers,
that
it
had
made
numerous
efforts,
that
its
equipment
was
air-
conditioned,
it
was
clean,
it
was
modern
equipment,
and
that
in-spite
of
that
the
passengers
had
continued
to
leave
the
line.
there
was
compliant
that
the
new
dining
service
on
it,
but
with
seven
passengers
or
with
an
average
of
20
passengers
in
all,
the
railroad
couldn't
continue
that
dining
service,
there
was
testimony
that
there
had
been
dining
service
on
that,
it
had
been
forced
to
be
dropped,
because
of
lack
of
patronage.
there
was
testimony
for
example
that
there
had
been
either
a
restaurant
or
a
news
van
from
which
food
could
be
purchased
in
durham
and
that,
that
had
to
be
abandoned
because
of
lack
of
passengers.
there
was
no
specific
testimony
as
to
neglect,
rather
than
some
painting
that
had
not
been
done,
and
i
think
there
was
testimony
that
on
one
or
more
occasions
in
a
period
of
years,
the
cars
had
not
been
pre-cooled
and
were
hot
when
the
passengers
got
on.
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
cars
are
air-
conditioned
and
the
service
is
substantially
adequate.
to
get
to
time,
your
honor
referred
to
the
time,
the
railroad
schedule
is
from
an
hour
and
45
minutes
for
one
train
an
hour
and
f55
for
another.
i'm
speaking
now
from
durham
to
greensboro.
that
is
going
west
to
make
connection
with
the
main
line
of
the
southern.
the
bus
schedule
is
from
two
hours
and
five
minutes
for
local
buses
to
an
hour
and
20
minutes
for
the
expresses
buses.
now
to
raleigh,
the
train
schedule
is
from
an
hour
--
from
45
minutes
to
an
hour,
the
bus
schedule
is
35
minutes.
as
i
say
there
has
been
this
great
diminution.
the
great
diminution
has
been
primarily
due
to
the
adequacy
of
other
transportation,
may
i
address
myself
to
that
for
just
a
moment?
there
is
an
airport,
raleigh-durham
airport,
which
serves
practically
all
of
eastern
north
carolina.
it's
12
miles
from
durham,
it's
14
miles
from
raleigh,
it's
between
the
two.
there
are
numerous
flights.
i
believe
it's
nine
flights
to
new
york
and
eight
flights
to
washington
and
flights
to
atlanta.
that
airport
is
very
heavily
patronized.
the
figures
were
that,
that
airport
had
an
annual
take
of
passengers
of
134,000
as
compared
to
14,000
for
the
railroad,
approximately
10
to
1.
another
significant
fact
to
give
at
this
part,
mr.
watts
hill
who
was
chairman
of
a
number
of
things
in
durham,
a
very
prominent
citizen,
but
who
is
also
chairman
of
the
research
triangle
institute,
which
is
a
party
to
this.
it's
a
very
fine
and
very
laudable
research
project
in
which
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
interested,
which
is
located,
it's
called
the
research
triangle
because
it's
located
in
the
triangle
formed
by
state
college
at
raleigh,
duke
university
at
durham
and
university
of
north
carolina
at
chapel
hill.
and
mr.
hill
testified
against
us,
he
testified
against
the
taking
off
of
the
trains,
and
he
gave
specific
figures.
he
said
that
for
the
eight
months
from
january
the
1st
1959
until
august
of
31st,
1959
the
research
triangle
institute
of
which
he
was
chairman
of
the
board
had
expended
$13,211
for
air
transport
and
$361.62
for
rail
travel.
on
cross
examination
he
was
asked
to
break
down
that
rail
travel
to
find
out
how
much
of
it
was
southern
railroad
trains
and
how
much
of
it
was
for
other
trains
and
he
said
that
he
would
bring
that
evidence
in
the
next
day,
he
did
not
do.
but
at
any
rate
that's
36
to
1
air
travel
over
rail
travel.
there
are
a
few
other
significant
things
i
would
call
to
your
honor's
attention
about
the
airport
and
air
travel.
it's
in
the
record
that
burlington
industries
man
testified
that
30
to
40
employees
of
durham
industries
are
regular
users
of
that
transportation.
on
cross
examination
he
changed
that
estimate
to
five,
and
the
court
below
uses
that
30
to
40.
the
court
below
referred
to
some
army
witnesses
that
testified
as
to
their
use
of
the
train
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
a
quotation
on
cross
examination
where
one
of
the
army
officers
says,
the
normal
individual
with
whom
i
am
associated
would
probably
travel
by
air.
the
figures
support
that.
as
i
say
from
durham
to
greensboro
there
are
15
buses
each
way,
each
day
and
this
passenger
travel
has
diminished
because
the
passengers
have
--
the
potential
passengers
have
exercised
their
privilege
of
using
other
transportation.
they
are
just
a
few
left,
just
a
very
few
left.
just
one
or
two
other
things
that
i
want
to
say,
because
i
like
to
leave
sometime
for
reply.
the
court
below
said
practically
nothing
about
other
means
of
transportation.
the
witnesses
said
practically
nothing.
the
brief
of
the
state
says
practically
nothing.
the
state
referred
to
some
witnesses
and
the
only
witness
who
testified
was
a
mr.
george
klux
i
believe
and
he
testified
that
the
buses
were
dirty
and
inconvenient
and
hot.
he
didn't
testify
that
he
had
ever
enquired
about
a
schedule.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
for
the
witnesses
against
the
railroad
testified
as
to
any
knowledge
of
the
bus
schedules,
of
the
use
of
the
buses.
there
were
people
evidently
who
did
not
care
to
use
buses
and
hadn't
used
buses.
as
matter
of
a
fact
there
was
testimony
in
the
case,
that
testimony
was
in
1960,
1961
that
the
modern
buses
were
air
conditioned,
that
they
were
all
general
motors
buses,
they
were
air
conditioned
and
furnished
with
rest
rooms.
the
state
also
referred
to
the
necessity
of
a
railroad
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
referred
to
weather
conditions
and
the
necessity
of
the
railroad
as
a
standby
service.
well
that's
about
what
it
has
resolved
itself
into,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
proper
and
it
is
not
supported
for
the
court
and
commissioner
was
proper
in
saying
that
the
standby
service
was
a
service
that
railroads
should
not
be
called
on
to
use.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
bus
service
is
not
completely
adequate.
there
are
15
buses
each
way
each
day,
between
raleigh
and
greensboro
and
raleigh
and
durham.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
there
is
nothing
the
opinions
to
indicate
that
the
bus
service
isn't
adequate
and
it
is
certainly
service
that
most
of
the
people
must
have
taken,
because
we,
the
railroad
now
has
a
very
minimum
of
passengers.
the
only
passengers
it
has
to
speak
of
are
the
intrastate
passengers
who
are
bound
for
the
connection
at
greensboro
and
points
north.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
yes
sir,
there
is
very,
very
adequate
service
at
raleigh.
there
are
six
trains,
i
think
that
it's
in
the
record
there
are
six
trains
each
way,
each
day.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
yes
sir,
that's
north
and
south.
mr.
william
t.
joyner
there
is
pullman
service
to
washington
and
new
york
from
raleigh.
that
is
the
most
convenient
part.
the
coast
line,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
coast
line
i
think
has
only
two
--
it
is
on
the
main
line
of
coastline
goes
through
selma
which
is
between
raleigh
and
goldsboro,
but
that
is
not
a
point
of
great
interest
to
us
here
because
there
are
no
complaints
below
of
raleigh.
evidently
the
people
there
do
take
the
coast
line
train
at
selma,
but
there
are
no
complaints
they
have
and
there
is
frequent
service
on
the
seaboard.
there
is
evidenced
for
the
fact
that
there
are
no
passengers
on
this
train
from
raleigh,
although
the
pullman
begins
at
raleigh,
passengers
get
on
it
at
durham.
now
by
taking
a
ride,
a
very
short
ride
of
some
30
minutes,
35
minutes,
they
can
get
from
durham
to
raleigh,
that's
less
than
if
you
were
to
get
to
a
station
in
the
ordinary
city,
in
the
fact
that
the
service
there
is
very
active.
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
can
leave
washington,
that's
shown
on
the
record,
you
can
leave
washington
at
2:18
or
2:15
i
think
it
this
afternoon,
get
into
raleigh,
at
7:13
and
you
can
be
in
durham
by
8:30,
you
spend
the
night
at
home
rather
than
waiting
to
take
the
pullman
out
of
raleigh.
there
is
ample
service
over
the
seaboard
to
raleigh.
it's
a
very,
very
short
distance.
there
is
frequent
bus
service
between
durham
and
raleigh
and
approximately
35
minutes
of
travel.
i
would
save
the
rest
of
the
time.
