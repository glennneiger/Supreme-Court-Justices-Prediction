(inaudible)
mr.

as
i
computed
the
figures
you
gave
us,
it
takes
the
buses
an
hour
and
55
minutes
to
go
the
length
of
this
distance,
35
minutes
for
one
leg
of
it,
then
an
hour
and
20
minutes
for
the
rest
of
it.
it
takes
an
hour
and
55
minutes
for
the
bus,
but
it
takes
four
hours
for
the
railroad.
chief

oh
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
that
i
asked
it
was
there
was
something
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
to
the
effect
that
the
railroad
had
made
no
effort
to
get
this
passenger
traffic,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl

what
is
your
viewpoint?
was
there
testimony

that?
chief

earl

of
it?
