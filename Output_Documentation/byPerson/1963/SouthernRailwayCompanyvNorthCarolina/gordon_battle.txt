mr.
gordon
battle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
purpose
is
to
discuss
the
appellee's
contention
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
13
a
(2),
as
it
applies
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
remainder
of
our
argument
will
be
by
mr.
barbee,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
north
carolina.
it
is
our
position
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
continued
operation
of
these
last
two
passenger
trains
imposes
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
the
language
of
the
court
below.
all
material
factors
bearing
on
the
question
must
be
taken
into
account.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
consider
a
fair
picture.
our
argument
on
this
is
bottomed
on
two
cases
that
this
court
decided
in
1958,
first
of
those
is
the
chicago,
milwaukee,
st.
p.
&
p
railroad
company
versus
illinois,
355
u.s.
300.
in
that
case
interstate
commerce
commission
acting
under
section
13
(4),
the
act
as
it
was
written
then,
had
authorized
an
increase
in
the
railroads
intrastate
passenger
rates
on
the
trains
commuter
service
to
make
up
for
an
annual
deficit
of
$306,000.
under
the
statue
the
icc
was
authorized
to
do
this
upon
a
finding
that
the
existing
intrastate
rate
“causes
any
undue
unreasonable
or
unjust
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.”
this
court
in
considering
that
case
pointed
out
that
the
intrastate
rates
were
primarily
the
concern
of
individual
states
involved.
that
the
justification
for
the
exercise
of
federal
power
must
clearly
appear
and
this
court
held,
“we
do
not
think
that
the
deficit
from
this
single
commuter
operation
can
fairly
be
adjudged
to
work
an
undue
discrimination
against
the
milwaukee
road's
interstate
operations
without
findings
which
take
into
account,
the
deficit
in
the
light
of
the
carrier's
other
intrastate
revenues
from
illinois'
traffic,
freight
and
passenger.”
now
following
that
case
in
may
of
1958,
this
court
also
decided
the
case
of
public
service
commission
of
utah
versus
the
united
states,
356
u.s.
421.
in
the
utah
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
authorized
an
intrastate
freight
increase
and
this
court
in
a
five
to
four
decision
held
among
other
things
that
it
was
error
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
not
to
have
considered
the
revenues
and
conditions
incident
to
intrastate
passenger
operations.
in
other
words,
this
court
was
taking
the
position
that
in
determining
whether
the
state
rates
posed
an
unjust,
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
the
icc
was
required
to
look
at
more
than
just
the
loss
from
the
particular
operation
involved.
they
had
to
look
at
the
total
intrastate
situation
as
it
existed.
now
following
those
two
decisions,
in
1958
the
congress
enacted
section
13
a
(2)
and
we
say
that
in
looking
at
the
language
of
section
13
a
(2),
we
see
that
among
other
things
after
a
full
hearing
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
required
to
find
that
the
continued
operation
of
such
train
without
discontinuance
will
constitute
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
upon
the
interstate
operations
of
such
carrier
or
upon
interstate
commerce.
now
we
feel
that
the
language
there
is
similar
to
the
language
that
was
in
section
13
(4)
that
was
passed
upon
by
this
court.
we
feel
that
taking
off
a
passenger
train
is
obviously
more
serious
matter
to
a
state
than
fixing
the
rate
or
the
charge
that
is
going
to
be
made
for
the
service.
therefore,
it's
a
matter
of
more
concern
and
stricter
requirements
must
be
met
and
we
say
that
congress
would
not
have
used
that
language
unless
they
expected
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
considering
whether
or
not
to
allow
a
passenger
train
to
be
discontinued.
to
look
at
more
than
just
the
loss
resulting
from
the
operation
of
that
one
train
there
must
be
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
how
do
you
determine
whether
a
burden
is
just
or
unjust
when
you
fail
to
take
into
consideration,
the
profit
made
by
the
railroad
on
its
freight
operations
on
the
same
line
of
track,
without
looking
at
the
profit
made
by
the
railroad
from
its
intrastate
service
in
north
carolina?
now
our
opponents
say
that
this
is
not
so,
that
we
should
look
at
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
enactment
of
the
statute
and
they
say
they
find
there
an
interpretation
contrary
to
what
i
have
given.
we
are
delighted
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
enactment
of
this
statue
and
contend
that
the
legislative
history
very
much
supports
our
position.
when
these
two
decisions
were
handed
down
congress
was
considering
the
transportation
act
of
1958
as
originally
reported
by
the
house
committee,
the
proposal
that
ended
up
as
section
13,
would
not
have
applied
at
all
to
intrastate
trains.
therefore,
we
say
that
quotations
from
that
house
report
in
southern's,
in
the
icc
brief,
do
not
show
the
legislative
intent
regarding
something
that
was
not
even
proposed
at
that
time.
now
--
the
house
by
amendment
also
deleted
what
has
been
referred
to
by
the
interstate
commerce
attorney
as
the
net
loss
provision
that
had
been
of
concern
in
the
senate,
particularly
by
senator
javits.
the
opponents
of
the
net
loss
provision,
senator
javits
and
others
were
afraid
it
would
become
the
sole
controlling
factor.
whereas
the
members
of
congress
who
were
in
favor
of
the
legislation
has
originally
proposed,
argued
that
as
it
was
worded
then
it
would
be
only
one
factor
to
be
considered.
at
any
rate
as
originally
reported,
the
senate
bill
provided
the
same
criteria
for
the
discontinuance
of
an
interstate
or
an
intrastate
train.
senator
russell
called
this
a
“direct
and
drastic
blow
to
the
authority
of
the
state
regulatory
bodies”
and
the
bill
was
amended
to
limit
the
icc's
discontinuance
authority
to
interstate
trains.
in
the
conference
committee
the
bill
was
divided
into
section
13
a
(1)
pertaining
to
interstate
trains
and
section
13
a
(2)
pertaining
to
totally
intrastate
trains.
section
13
a
(1)
gave
rather
broad
powers
to
the
icc
involving
the
discountenance
of
interstate
trains
while
13
a
(2)
gave
the
icc
limited
appellate
control
over
totally
intrastate
trains.
contrary
to
the
contention
of
the
appellants,
we
say
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
section
13
a
(1)
and
section
13
a
(2)
and
invite
the
court's
comparison
of
the
two
statutes.
now,
at
the
same
time
that
section
13
a
(1)
and
(2)
was
enacted,
congress
amended
section
13
(4),
the
section
of
the
statute
of
which
had
been
construed
by
the
court
in
the
chicago
and
utah
cases.
and
the
court,
but
the
congress
added
to
section
13
(4)
a
parenthetical
provision
after
saying
that
the
rate
to
be
changed
are
upon
the
finding
of
the
unreasonable
or
undue
burden
and
the
parenthetical
expression
was
which
the
commission
may
find
without
a
separation
of
interstate
and
intrastate
property,
revenues
and
expenses
and
without
considering
in
totality
the
operations
or
results
thereof
of
any
carrier
or
group
of
carriers,
wholly
within
any
state.
now
that
amendment
may
it
please
the
court
was
prompted
by
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
utah
case.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opening
had
expressed
grave
concern
that
this
requirement
of
considering
the
total
intrastate
operations
imposed
an
impossible
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
look
into
all
of
this
and
have
all
of
these
accounting
procedures
every
time
they
wanted
to
change
it
right.
now
we
say
that
if
congress
which,
look
flip
this
amendment
in
section
13
(4)
at
the
same
time
section
13
a
(2)
was
enacted,
and
while
the
chicago
and
utah
cases
were
ripe
in
the
mind
of
the
congressmen
and
the
senators
that
the
very
least
that
congress
would
have
done
had
they
not
--
had
they
wanted
the
icc
to
only
look
at
the
loss
from
the
particular
train
involved,
the
very
least
they
would
have
done
was
put
this
same
language
in
section
13
a
(2)
that
they
added
to
section
13
(4).
this
wasn't
done
and
i
argue
to
you
that
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
done
is
because
congress
knew
that
this
was
the
most
serious
thing
that
could
be
done
to
the
states,
that
this
was
the
real
area
where
the
state
regulatory
commissions
were
primarily
concerned.
now
in
addition
to
that
point,
when
section
--
when
the
housing
senate
conference
committee
reported
back
to
the
senate,
senator
smathers
who
had
been
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
the
interstate
commerce
committee
that
proposed
these
amendments
to
section
13
a
made
the
following
comment.
now
this
was
in
regards
to
compromised
version
and
this
is
in
regards
to
the
statute
as
it
was
finally
enacted.
he
said
with
respect
to
the
discontinuance
of
service
we
have
given
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
first
time
the
right
to
discontinue
service
where
the
service
crosses
a
state
line.
that
was
section
13
a
(1).
however,
we
protected
the
right
of
the
states
so
ably
explained
by
the
distinguished
senator
from
georgia
and
those
are
those
concerned
about
states'
rights,
by
leaving
to
the
state
regulatory
agencies,
the
right
to
regulate
and
have
a
final
decision
with
respect
to
the
discontinuance
of
train
service
which
originated
and
ended
within
one
particular
state
except
when
it
could
be
a
established
that
intrastate
service
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
intrastate
service
in
north
carolina
is
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
southern
makes
a
profit
on
its
intrastate
operations
in
north
carolina,
not
a
loss.
mr.
gordon
battle
yes.
mr.
gordon
battle
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
battle
as
a
matter
of
theory,
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
battle
yes
sir,
the,
we
argue
more
the
630,000
in
the
30
million,
but
certainly
it's
of
interest
whether
this
is
a
distressed
railroad
or
not.
we
think
the
$630,000
is
something
that
has
to
be
put
on
the
scales
not
just
left
off
and
forgot
about.
mr.
gordon
battle
no
your
honor,
no
your
honor.
we
the
record
in
this
case
for
example
shows
that
the
passengers
are
increasing
for
the
years
shown
by
record,
not
decreasing.
we
say
that
taking
the
record
as
a
whole
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
could
lead
a
reasonable
man
to
believe
that
these
trains
are
imposing
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
or
that
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
a
necessity,
as
require
them.
mr.
gordon
battle
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
battle
yes
sir,
but
i
believe
five
months
in
1961,
but
i
believe
also
the
1960
showed
a
slight
increase
over
1959
and
of
course
the
record,
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
record
about
the
type
of
areas
served
by
these
trains,
durham,
orange
and
alamance
counties.
the
durham
has
a
population
in
excess
of
70,000
people.
southern's
witness
could
recall
only
five
cities
in
the
united
states
of
that
size
that
didn't
have
passenger
service,
the
need
of
duke
university,
the
university
of
north
carolina
basically
mr.
barbee
has
argued.
now
i
quoted
what
senator
smathers
had
to
say.
southern
railway
in
its
brief
on
page
13
quotes
a
statement
by
senator
javits.
we
think
that
statement
is
very
much
in
support
of
our
position.
the
total,
this
comment
by
senator
javits
came
when
senator
bricker
was
explaining
to
senate
about
the
conference
committee
version
of
the
section
13
a
(1)
and
(2),
and
senator
javits
interrupted
senator
bricker
and
said,
the
point
i
raised
in
which
the
senator
from
connecticut
was
so
deeply
concerned
was
the
question
of
discountenance
if
a
net
loss
was
shown,
that
being
in
effect
the
sole
ground.
as
i
understand
the
conference
report
eliminates
the
net
loss
test
and
the
new
test
which
is
now
the
test
provided
by
the
bill
as
to
the
discontinuance
of
any
commuter
service,
because
that
was
what
troubled
us
particularly,
is
that
it
would
constitute
an
undue
burden
upon
the
operation
of
such
carrier
or
carriers
or
upon
interstate
commerce.
as
i
construe
that
provision,
the
commission
would
have
to
look
at
the
overall
situation
of
the
entire
railroad
in
order
to
determine
the
inequity
of
requiring
it
to
continue
a
particular
commuter
branch
and
senator
bricker
replied
to
that
said
the
question
involves
the
relation
between
the
commuter
income
and
income
from
the
other
services
which
the
railroad
renders.
so
we
say
that
there
is
no
question
but
what
any
and
all
relevant
factors
should
be
concerned.
it's
interesting
that
the
utah
case
involving
section
13
(4)
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute
that
case
went
back
to
the
lower
court
and
the
lower
court
construed
the
addition
to
13
(4)
as
meaning
not
that
as
being
a
matter
of
procedure
rather
than
of
substantive
change
of
the
law
and
said
that
unless
that
were
so
they
would
be
serious
constitutional
and
conception
question
involved
and
said
that
still
the
interstate
commerce
commission
what
when
there
was
evidence
presented
should
consider
any
and
all
relevant
factors.
now
may
i
please
the
court,
southern
railway
when
it
filed
this
petition
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
accused
the
state
of
north
carolina
her
utilities
commission
and
her
courts
of
imposing
an
unjust,
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
this
was
the
state
may
it
please
the
court
that
until
1954
it
had
three
pairs
of
passenger
trains
running
on
this
line
of
track.
in
1954,
the
state
of
north
carolina
authorized
one
of
them
to
be
removed.
in
april
of
1958,
the
state
of
north
carolina
authorized
two
more
to
be
removed,
leaving
this
one
last
train.
in
february
of
1959,
the
state
of
north
carolina
authorized
the
discontinuance
of
a
sleeper
car
that
went
from
raleigh
to
asheville
on
this
line.
between
1951
and
1956,
of
the
44
requests
for
discontinuance
filed
with
the
state
of
north
carolina
42
were
approved.
mr.
gordon
battle
i
do
not
know
some
of
them
were.
shortly
after
the
february
1959,
decision
allowing
the
sleeper
to
be
taken
off,
in
july
of
1959,
southern
filed
this
petition
for
discontinuing
these
last
three
passenger
trains
and
when
north
carolina
refused
to
let
the
last
ones
come
off.
on
this
line
of
track
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
itself
had
build
in
the
1800s
to
provide
railroad
service
for
it's
people
and
leases
to
southern
railway,
when
north
carolina
refused
to
let
the
last
passenger
trains
taken
off,
they
were
accused
of
imposing
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
north
carolina
pleaded
not
guilty
and
we
plead
not
guilty
now.
we
say
that
we
have
not
imposed
any
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
southern
railway
or
any
other
railroad.
what
we
have
done
is
ask
for
minimal
service
for
the
people
of
north
carolina,
that
the
railroad
makes
a
profit
and
that
north
carolina
pays
its
fair
share.
thank
you
very
much.
