mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
appeals,
one
by
the
united
states
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
number
93
and
the
other
by
the
southern
railroad
company,
in
number
74,
are
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
north
carolina.
i
am
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i'm
sharing
the
appellant's
time
with
colonel
joyner,
counsel
for
the
southern
railroad
company.
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
did
two
things.
it
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
13a
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
authorized
the
southern
railroad
company
to
discontinue
the
operation
of
two
passenger
trains
between
greensboro
and
goldsboro,
both
points
in
north
carolina.
and
secondly,
the
judgment
below,
prominently
and
perpetually,
enjoined
southern
from
discontinuing
the
operation
of
these
two
trains.
section
13a
was
enacted
in
1958,
as
a
part
of
the
transportation
act
of
1958.
for
the
first
time,
it
authorized
the
commission
to
permit
the
discontinuance
of
particular
train
services
as
distinguished
--
as
distinguished
from
the
total
abandonment
of
a
line
of
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
line
of
--
this
line
of
railroad,
greensboro
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
129
miles.
paragraph
(1)
of
section
13a
deals
with
the
discontinuance
of
trains
operated
from
a
point
in
one
state
to
a
point
in
another
state
that
is,
which
i
would
refer
to
as
interstate.
now,
paragraph
(2)
here
involved
the
deals
with
discontinuance
of
trains
operated
wholly
within
the
boundaries
of
a
single
state.
last
term
this
court
in
new
jersey
v.
new
york,
susquehanna
&
western
railroad,
had
occasion
to
interpret
and
apply
that
dichotomy
as
between
paragraph
(1)
and
paragraph
(2).
paragraph
(2)
provides
that
where
a
state
authority
has
denied
a
railroad
application
for
permission
to
discontinue
an
interstate
train
or
where
the
local
commission
has
failed
to
act
upon
such
an
application,
for
120
days,
then
the
railroad
is
authorized
to
petition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
permission
to
discontinue
the
service
of
the
train.
and
13a
(2)
further
provides
that
the
commission
may
grant
such
authority,
only
after
full
hearing
and
upon
findings
by
it
that
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
as
such
discontinuance
and
that
the
continued
operation
of
such
train
will
constitute
an
unjust
and
undue
burden
on
the
interstate
operations
of
the
carrier
or
upon
interstate
commerce.
in
this
case,
the
north
carolina
commission
had
previously
denied
an
application
by
southern
under
state
law
for
authority
to
discontinue
the
trains.
and
the
action
of
the
state
commission
was
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
after
that,
southern
filed
a
petition
with
the
--
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
13a
(2).
after
a
hearing
at
which
the
state
and
other
protestants
appeared
and
participated,
the
commission
hearing
examiner
issued
a
detailed
report,
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
25,
in
which
he
recommended
that
southern
be
authorized
to
discontinue
these
two
trains.
following
exceptions
of
the
examiner's
report,
division
3
of
the
commission,
consisting
of
three
commissioners,
issued
its
report
and
in
which
had
adopted
the
examiner's
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
and
stated
its
views
on
certain
of
the
issues
presented
by
the
parties.
according
to
the
precise
operating
facts,
these
two
trains
operate.
actually,
it's
the
same
set
of
equipment
operating
once
a
day
in
each
direction.
they
operate
between
greensboro
and
goldsboro
which
they
--
i
say,
both
points
in
north
carolina,
with
intermediate
stops,
including
raleigh
and
durham.
the
distance
--
the
total
distance
is
about
129
miles.
there's
a
map
at
page
79
of
the
record
which
your
honors
may
find
of
assistance
in
visualizing
the
physical
problem
involved,
page
79
in
--
in
volume
1
of
the
printed
record.
the
green
line
represents
part
of
the
southern
railway
system.
the
branch
here
involved
from
greensboro
over
to
goldsboro
has
been
underlined
in
red.this
is
southern's
main
line,
going
up
through
greensboro.
the
blue
line
is
the
main
line
of
the
seaboard
moving
through
raleigh,
approximately
midpoint
on
this
branch
line.
and
this
yellow
line
moving
through
selma
is
the
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad.
these
two
trains
constitute
the
only
rail
passenger
service
remaining
on
this
greensboro-goldsboro
branch.
they
consist
of
a
locomotive,
a
passenger
car,
a
combination
of
passenger
baggage
express
car.
also,
they
include
a
pullman
sleeper,
which
operates
only
between
raleigh
and
greensboro.
the
sleeper
is
switched
into
other
southern
railroad
trains
at
greensboro
so
as
to
provide
through
sleeping
car
service
to
washington.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
appellees
state
in
their
brief
that
this
through
pullman
sleeper
car
service
is
the
principal
public
convenience
still
served
by
these
two
trains.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
be
from
raleigh
over
to
greensboro
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
on
this
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
then
--
then
the
car
would
be
switched
in
the
northbound
trains
on
southern's
main
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
so
they
have
two
sleeper
services
via
greensboro
to
raleigh,
north
--
both
northbound
and
southbound.
both
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
commission
found
that
the
operation
of
these
trains
results
in
a
net
loss
to
southern.
and
that
their
discontinuance
would
result
in
actual
annual
savings
considerably
in
excess
of
$90,000
a
year.
it
found
that
the
public
use
of
the
trains
had
declined
sharply
since
1948.
for
example
in
1948,
both
trains
carried
56,700
passengers,
an
average
of
77
per
train
--
per
trip.
while
in
1950,
they
carried
14,700
passengers,
an
average
of
20
per
trip.
during
the
same
period,
the
passenger
revenues
per
trip
declined
from
$82
to
$28.
now,
both
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
commission
noted
the
fact
that
on
the
five
months
--
first
five
months
of
1961,
the
latest
figures
in
the
record,
that
there
had
been
an
increase
in
the
average
number
of
passengers
from
20
to
29
and
on
the
passenger
revenue
per
trip
from
$28
to
$35,
but
it
noted
that
this
increase
was
largely
due
to
movements
of
school
children.
and
even
assuming
that
such
an
increase
was
neither
temporary
nor
seasonal,
the
commission
found
that
during
those
first
five
months
of
1961,
there
were
total
passenger
revenues
for
the
two
trains
of
$10,600
and
that
that
was
less
than
one-third
of
merely
the
train
and
engine
crew
wages
of
$36,000
to
--
for
getting
fuel
every
station
expense
and
everything
else.
the
revenues
were
less
than
one-third
of
the
direct
crew
and
engine
wages.
the
examiner
made
detailed
findings,
adopted
by
the
commission,
as
the
alternative
transportation
service
which
would
be
available
upon
the
discontinuance
of
these
two
trains.
and
that
will
be
discussed
in
some
detail,
if
the
court
please,
by
colonel
joyner,
with
whom
i'm
sharing
the
argument.
the
commission
found
that
the
cost
to
the
carrier
of
operating
the
trains
greatly
exceeds
the
benefit
derived
by
the
traveling
public
and
that
the
public
would
not
be
materially
inconvenienced
by
the
discontinuance
of
the
trains.
thereupon,
it
made
the
basic
findings
required
by
the
statute
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
the
discontinuance.
and
that
their
continued
operation
would
impose
unjust
and
undue
burden
upon
southern's
interstate
operations
and
upon
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
court
below
based
its
judgment
on
two
grounds.
it
said,
"as
a
matter
of
law,
we
think
that
the
icc
cannot
be
said
to
have
made
a
proper
finding
unless
it
takes
into
account
the
profits
that
southern
railway
makes
in
its
freight
operations
on
the
same
intrastate
line,"
that
is
on
this
greensboro-goldsboro
segment.
and
the
court
went
on
to
compute
by
a
method
which
we
will
show
to
be
fallacious,
that
in
1960,
this
greensboro-goldsboro
segment
made
a
net
freight
operating
profit
of
$630,000
as
compared
with
the
direct
passenger
loss
of
$90,000.
and
the
court
made
its
own
finding
that
taking
into
account,
total
operation
of
this
line,
again,
meaning
the
greensboro-goldsboro
line.
there
is
a
profit,
not
a
loss,
a
benefit,
not
a
burden.
and
then
it
went
on,
having
found
that
there
was
no
burden,
to
make
its
own
independent
determination
that
convenience
on
this
public
convenience
necessity
required
maintenance
of
the
service.
we
think
the
court
erred
in
both
respects.
we
submit
that
the
court
erred
in
holding
that
under
section
13a
(2),
the
commission
could
not
authorize
the
southern
to
discontinue
these
two
trains
without
considering
whether
freight
operations,
over
this
particular
branch
line,
produce
sufficient
earnings
as
a
whole
so
that
the
whole
branch
operation
made
a
fair
contribution
to
southern's
overall
financial
condition.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
erred
in
making
its
own
independent
evaluation
of
the
facts
as
to
burden
and
as
to
public
use
and
need
of
the
service.
if
the
court
please,
i
shall
devote
my
share
of
the
argument
largely
to
our
contention
as
to
the
proper
construction
of
13a
(2).
but
first,
i
think
it
maybe
necessary
to
clarify
what
that
question
is.
i
say
that
because
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
railway
labor
executives'
association,
as
amicus
curiae,
they
state
that
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
error
for
the
commission
to
conclude
that
their
was
an
undue
burden
without
taking
into
account
the
total
financial
results
of
operation
of
the
trackage
involved
and
the
overall
prosperity
of
southern,
that
is
this
southern
system-wide
operations.
and
a
similar
suggestion
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
north
carolina
interest.
now,
it's
true
that
at
page
640,
the
court
of
the
--
the
lower
court
does
appear
to
be
saying
that.
but
after
a
detailed
discussion
and
analysis,
the
court
makes
itself
clear
as
follows
--what
page
did
you
say?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
640,
the
record
at
640.
the
lower
court
uses
language
which
seems
to
support
our
allies'
statement
of
issue.
but
thereafter,
after
detailed
analysis
and
discussion
and
at
page
654,
the
court
makes
clear
what
it's
holding
in
these
terms
at
page
654.
the
court
says,
"but
it
is
unfair
to
compare
the
loss
from
a
particular
segment
of
a
passenger
rail
line
to
the
total
profit
of
the
company
nor
is
this
the
test.”
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
segment,
which
they
meant
goldsboro
--
greensboro
here.
the
test
is
whether
the
particular
segment
of
the
railway
involved
is
contributing
its
fair
share
to
the
overall
company
operations.
so
we
submit
that
the
question
--
that
the
real
question
of
statutory
construction,
presented
by
the
decision
below,
and
certainly
the
one
we
thought
we
will
bring
into
the
court,
was
whether
under
section
13a
(2),
the
commission
may
authorize
the
discontinuance
of
passenger
trains
operated
over
a
particular
branch
or
segment
of
track,
without
determining
whether
freight
operations
over
that
particular
branch
or
segment,
produce
a
profit
or
a
deficit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
to
begin
with
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
--
the
standards
are
the
same
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
in
both
paragraph
(1)
and
paragraph
(2).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
theoretically,
except
that
the
commission
is
required
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
as
--
as
on
the
abandonment
statute
to
--
to
bounce
the
burden
against
the
public's
need
for
service
and
it
does
so.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
theoretically.
i
can
give
you
--
i
can
give
you
one
brief
figure
to
show
what
actually
happens
in
the
last
fiscal
year
for
which
i
have
figures,
1962
and
in
proceedings
under
the
--
this
13a
(2),
intrastate
trains.
the
commission
authorized
the
discontinuance
of
15
trains
and
required
the
continued
operation
of
51.
so
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
well,
the
quantum
of
passenger
service
is
diminishing
in
this
country,
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
disappearing
overnight
and
will
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
balance
between
the
use
and
need
for
the
service
and
--
and
the
burden
of
providing.
turning
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
think
that
alone
is
dispositive
here.
under
13a
(2),
the
commission
was
find
that
the
continued
operation
of
such
train
will
produce
the
unjust
or
undue
burden.
the
burden
is
to
be
measured
by
the
operating
results
of
the
train,
not
by
a
branch
line.
but
the
economic
and
legislative
history
we
think,
make
this
even
clearer.
when
congress
enacted
section
13a
in
1958,
it
was
dealing
with
the
specific
and
relatively
recent
form
of
ways
to
transportation
resources.
it
was
dealing
with
the
revolution
in
passenger
transportation.
by
1957,
intercity
passenger
traffic
in
the
united
states,
which
was
just
before
13a
was
enacted,
had
the
following
concestor,
rail,
3.7%,
motorbus,
3.5%,
air,
3.9%,
private
automobile,
88%.
and
with
this
decline
in
public
patronage,
that
service
began
to
produce
substantial
deficits
which
were
interrupted
only
briefly
in
world
war
ii
years.
according
to
the
commission
studies,
by
1956,
the
annual
aggregate
railroad
passenger
deficit
amounted
to
about
$700
million.
so
when
congress
turned
the
railroad
problems
in
1958,
one
of
its
primary
concerns
was
to
reduce
--
to
alleviate
this
huge
debilitating
financial
drain
on
the
railroad
system.
as
the
house
committee
put
it
a
major
cause
of
the
worsening
railroad
situation
is
the
unsatisfactory
passenger
situation.
not
only
is
the
passenger
end
of
the
business
not
making
money,
it
is
losing
a
substantial
portion
of
that
produce
by
freight
operations,
where
this
passenger
service
cannot
be
made
to
pay
its
own
way
because
of
lack
of
patronage
at
reasonable
rates,
abandonment
seems
called
for.
the
senate
committee
put
it
that
the
maintenance
and
operation
of
such
outmoded
services
and
facilities
constitutes
a
heavy
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
we
think
that
supports
the
little
(inaudible)
of
section
13a
(1).
but
congress
was
concerned
--
the
congress
itself
found
that
the
operation
of
passenger
trains,
not
much
patronage
and
of
a
heavy
deficit,
by
itself,
creates
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
that
has
not
be
operation
--
the
total
operations
of
a
branch
line
you'll
look
at
to
--
to
find
the
burden,
you'll
look
to
the
operation
of
the
particular
services.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
real
issue
before
congress,
the
real
fighting
issue,
was
not
whether
the
commission
should
be
empowered
to
authorize
the
discontinuance
of
losing
passenger
services
but
whether
it
should
be
required
to
do
so.
that
issue
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
as
the
bill,
which
contained
13a
(2),
was
reported
from
both
the
senate
and
house
committee
--
commerce
committees.
it
provided
that
the
commission
could
not
require
the
continued
operation
of
a
train,
unless
it
found
that
service
was
required
by
public
convenience
necessity
and
that
such
operation
will
not
result
in
a
net
loss
therefrom
to
the
carrier.
at
that
point,
once
the
carrier
showed
a
net
loss,
as
the
carrier
did
here
in
the
operation
of
a
particular
train,
it
have
the
unfettered
right
to
take
it
off.
now,
this
net
loss
standard
was
objected
to
particularly
by
senator
javits
from
a
great
commuter
state,
who
feared
and
he
was
right
just
among
face
of
the
language
that
it
would
leave
the
commission
powerless
to
prevent
the
discontinuance
of
deficit
commuter
trains
on
which
some
large
cities
heavily
depend.
and
he
unsuccessfully,
that
is
in
the
senate,
proposed
deletion
of
the
net
loss
standard
in
favor
of,
to
use
his
words,
giving
icc
a
balanced
authority
to
deal
with
the
situation,
both
in
respect
of
losses
and
in
respect
to
the
public
in
way
of
convenience
necessity.
eventually,
in
the
conference
committee,
the
net
loss
standard
was
deleted
in
favor
of
the
present
standard
to
section
13a.
and
in
the
senate
debate
approving
the
conference
bill,
senator
javits
remarked
that
now,
the
commission
would
have
to
look
at
the
overall
situation
of
the
entire
railroad
in
order
to
determine
the
inequity
of
requiring
it
to
continue
a
particular
commuter
branch.
but
there
was
not
a
word
in
all
of
this
debate.
there
was
not
a
word
to
suggest
that
in
determining
whether
a
particular
passenger
service
constitutes
a
loss.
the
commission
must
also
look
to
freight
operations
on
that
particular
branch
or
segment
of
traffic,
not
a
word.
now,
we
submit
there
are
also
practical
reasons
which
precluded
the
interpretation
of
the
lower
court.
and
that's
this,
whether
or
not
southern's
freight
operations
between
greensboro
and
goldsboro
produce
a
profit
is
quite
fortuitous
that
has
no
necessary
relationship
to
the
--
to
the
public's
need
for
--
for
passenger
service.
there
might
--
it
--
it
might
be
losing
money
on
freight
service.
but
--
concede
with
them
--
it
could
be
an
overwhelming
public
need
for
the
passenger
service.
so
we
think
our
--
that
the
commission's
power
to
require
the
continuance
of
passenger
services,
for
which
there's
a
substantial
need,
should
not
be
made
to
hinge
on
it
but
purely
fortuitous
factor
of
how
profitable
freight
--
how
freight
--
how
profitable
freight
operations
happen
to
be
on
that
particular
branch.
the
court
below,
in
arriving
at
its
interpretation
of
section
13a
(2),
relied
very
heavily
upon
a
transfer
to
section
13a
(2)
of
this
court's
construction
of
the
somewhat
different
standards
in
section
13
(4),
which
deals
with
the
commission's
powers
to
prescribe
the
intrastate
freight
rates
and
particularly
with
the
interpretation
prior
to
the
amendment
of
section
13
(4)
in
1958.
the
lower
court's
reasoning
is
extensive
and
somewhat
complicated
but
i
would
summarize
it,
and
i
hope
fairly,
this
way.
prior
to
1958,
in
the
milwaukee
case
in
355
u.s.
and
the
utah
case
in
356
u.s.,
this
court
held
that
under
section
13
(4),
the
commission
must
make
findings
with
respect
to
the
results
of
all
of
a
railroad's
intrastate
operations,
all
commodities,
freight,
passenger,
before
it
may
conclude
that
a
particular
intrastate
rate
creates
unfair
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
thereupon,
the
court
below
concluded
that
this
passenger
train
discontinue
its
cases
under
13a
(2),
standing
in
a
fortiori
relationship
to
section
13
(4)
cases
which
are
described
as
the
existing
law
applicable
to
discontinuance
matters.
well,
at
this
point,
the
court
had
to
recognize
that
in
1958,
following
this
court's
milwaukee
and
utah
decisions,
congress
amended
section
13
(4)
extensively.
but
the
language
which
we
contend
makes
unnecessary
in
intrastate
rate
cases,
any
findings
by
the
commission
as
to
the
results
of
the
railroad's
total
intrastate
operations.
so
the
court
below
found
decisive
significance
in
the
--
in
the
fact
that
in
enacting
section
13a
(2),
in
the
same
transportation
act
of
1958,
congress
had
not
there
provided
with
equal
specificity
that
an
intrastate
train
discontinue
its
cases.
the
commission
need
not
consider
the
results
of
all
of
the
railroad's
intrastate
operations
within
the
particular
state.
we
discussed
this
leg
of
the
court's
opinion
in
some
detail
on
our
brief.
but
i
like
to
make
two
points
with
respect
to
that
rational
now.
there
was
no
icc
power
with
respect
to
train
discontinuance
as
distinguished
from
total
abandonment
prior
to
1958.
secondly,
even
consuming
the
validity
and
we
don't.
now,
the
court's
analysis
of
section
13
(4)
and
its
treatment
by
this
court
and
its
amendment
by
congress,
it
simply
doesn't
support
the
result
the
lower
court
arrived
at
because
no
principle
of
looking
to
all
of
the
results
of
a
--
of
a
carrier's
intrastate
operations,
ties
in
with
the
lower
court's
principle
that
you
must
look
to
all
the
carriers
in
operations
on
a
particular
branch
line.
they're
just
entirely
different
things.
so
we
submit
that
both
the
language
of
section
13a
(2),
its
literal
language,
perhaps
more
important,
its
obvious
economic
regulatory
purpose,
its
specific
legislative
history
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
commission
in
passing
upon
applications
for
train
discontinuance
and
this
would
be
the
same
where
there
was
an
interstate
train
or
intrastate
train
and
the
standards
are
the
same,
is
to
look
at
two
things,
the
burden
that
--
upon
the
carrier
of
--
of
providing
the
particular
deficit
passenger
service
versus
the
public's
need
and
use
of
that
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
has
indicated,
it
was
in
a
commuter
case
involving
alabama's
commuter
services
to
new
orleans
that
when
it
is
dealing
with
a
passenger
service
for
which
there's
a
substantial
demand
and
where
alternative
--
alternative
methods
of
transportation
are
not
readily
apparent,
that
it
will
--
that
it
will
look
to
the
carrier's
overall
financial
position.
and
i
--what
--
if
that
is
so,
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
will
be
the
--
i
understood
him
to
refer
to
the
overall
--
to
the
profitability
of
the
carrier's
total
system
operations.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
that
wasn't
a
test.
they
said
that
you
--
you'll
look
to
the
total
operations
on
the
particular
branch
line
or
segment
and
for
that,
we
respectfully
submit
there
is
no
basis
in
--
in
the
statute
or
its
history.
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
some
collateral
matters.
at
page
17
of
the
north
carolina
brief,
it
is
contended
that
southern
leases
the
goldsboro-greensboro
branch
from
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
that
the
lease
requires
continuance
of
passenger
service,
as
the
court
below
held
that
the
law
is
settled
that
any
such
lease
is
subordinate
to
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
and
critically
to
the
lower
court's
method
of
computing
a
freight
profit
of
$630,000
on
--
under
this
branch
line.
it
was
done
by
multiplying
southern's
system-wide
average
freight
earnings
per
mile
by
a
figure
of
61%
because
it
was
--
it
was
said
that
the
average
traffic
density
on
that
branch
was
60%
of
southern's
system-wide
average
density.
it
was
such
a
computation
wholly
ignores
the
effect
of
traffic
volume
on
profits
in
an
industry
with
high
fixed
cost.
and
worse
view
--
worse
yet,
the
computation
of
profits
included
both
interstate
and
intrastate
freight
movements.
a
theory
which
we
don't
believe
can
be
supported
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
appellee's
argument
that
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
circumstance
that
58%
of
southern's
losses
on
these
trains
is
offset
by
income
tax
reductions.
as
to
this,
we
think
the
court
below
correctly
and
pungently
dispose
of
it
by
noting
that
uneconomical
transportation
is
not
rendered
less
so
by
passing
a
portion
of
the
burden
to
federal
and
state
governments
in
the
form
of
reduced
income
taxes.
and
citing
forth
very
pertinently
we
think
this
court's
purcell
decision
in
315
u.s.
i'm
yielding
the
time
to
mr.
joyner.
