suppose
california
law
undoubtedly
had
attempted
to
provide
that
in
that
state
hotel
manager
would
have
the
right
to
go
into
the
rooms
of
their
guests,
they
suspected
that
they
are
guilty
of
a
crime,
had
something
that
--
evidence
of
the
crime,
you
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
first
amendment
--
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
forbade
such
a
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
be
contrarily
to
jeffers
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
state
property
law
was
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
your
basis
if
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
stems
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
common
law
you
mean
of
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
right
go
in
at
any
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
california
law
permits
him
to
do
that
of
course,
you
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
reasonable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
carried
on
his
person?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
trying
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
california
has
a
right
by
its
law
to
determine
who
can
search
a
room,
hotel
room
and
seize
the
stuff
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
argue
--
that's
your
first
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
innkeepers'
right
and
you
said
at
another
point
agreement,
those
are
two
different
things
as
i
understand
it
and
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
though
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
you
pose
is
rather
serious
or
rather
serious
constitutional
question
if
you
are
right,
that
the
law
of
california
permits
searches
to
be
made,
which
under
the
law
of
federal
government
would
be
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
except
for
the
fact
that
california
law
says
they
are
not
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
wouldn't
that
go
directly
contrary
to
what
we
held
in
mapp?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
fact,
i'm
talking
about
that
principle
by
which
you
are
arguing.
mapp
held
that
the
state
of
california
is
bound
by
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
saying
that
california
can
have
a
property
law
that
exempts
people
in
california,
or
denies
them
the
benefit
of
that
constitutional
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
but
you
are
saying
that
a
innkeeper
under
your
law
has
the
right
to
do
it
and
therefore
he
can
let
policemen
do
it
for
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
amount
in
the
end
to
a
search
which
might,
we
assume
that,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
which
let's
assume
that
it
was
a
direct
unequivocal
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection,
but
for
the
california
law
saying
that
the
man
had
a
right
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
between
the
two,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
different
--
now
that's
the
question
of
whether
it
is
unreasonable
within
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
get
that
but
--
and
maybe
you
are
not
arguing
the
other,
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
arguing
the
fourth
amendment
can't
control
there
if
california
cannot
because
it
has
property
laws
which
permits
searches
and
seizures
of
a
man's
room
without
a
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
technical,
would
it,
if
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
good
faith
violation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
good
faith
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
