mr.
arlo
e.
smith
your
honors,
facts
--
pardon
me,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
quite
simple.
however,
the
application
of
those
facts
to
the
law
and
the
effect
of
that
law
upon
our
federal
system
is
very
complex.
there
are
three
questions
presented
here;
first,
whether
or
not
the
search
of
this
hotel
room
was
reasonable;
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
items
seized
in
that
search
come
within
the
prohibition
of
the
so
called
means
and
instrumentalities
rule;
and
finally,
whether
or
not
if
the
search
were
improper,
the
seizure
were
improper,
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
into
the
case
resulted
in
error,
whether
or
not
that
error
was
prejudicial,
whether
or
not
the
states
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
bound
not
only
to
exclude
unreasonably
obtained
evidence,
but
to
automatically
reverse
every
case
in
which
such
an
error
occurred.
the
search
here
was
conducted
of
a
hotel
room
in
pomona.
the
defendant
was
then
in
las
vegas.
he
was
arrested
two
days
later
in
las
vegas,
approximately
200
miles
away
from
the
hotel
room.
we
do
not
hear
nor
did
we
below
argue
that
this
search
can
be
justified
as
an
incident
to
the
arrest
of
stoner
in
las
vegas.
we
contend
here,
as
we
urged
below,
that
the
officers
entered
that
room
with
a
proper
consent
of
the
management,
that
they
entered
believing
in
good
faith
that
the
manager
had
the
right
to
give
them
that
consent.
california
law
on
this
question,
we
feel,
is
quite
clear.
counsel
for
petitioner
seems
to
feel
that
it
is
quite
unclear.
we
have
cited
to
you
general
cases
safe
--
referring
to
the
authority
of
an
innkeeper
over
the
--
all
of
the
premises,
including
the
room.
this
apparently
is
not
uncommon.
last
sunday
while
reviewing
this
case
without
announcing
himself
a
member
of
the
--
an
employee
came
upon
me;
luckily
i
was
properly
attired
to
meet
both
guests
and
agents
of
the
innkeeper.
this
is
a
matter
of
implied
contract,
implied
understanding
between
the
parties.
we
feel
that
the
california
law
is
quite
clear.
we
have
cited
to
you
the
case
of
people
versus
ambrose.
we
think
it
covers
the
application
of
these
rules
in
the
criminal
case.
petitioner's
counsel
suggests
to
you
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
another
california
case,
the
case
of
people
versus
burke,
which
we
cited
to
you
also.
the
burke
case,
however,
is
--
goes
off
in
an
entirely
different
point
the
holding
of
that
case
is
that
the
search
of
the
hotel
room
was
proper
because
the
officers
had
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
defendant.
they
held
that
it
was
inconsequential
if
the
officers
had
entered
the
room
on
prior
occasions
because
it
had
no
bearing
upon
their
reasonable
and
probable
cause.
that
there
was
independent
ground
for
the
officers
to
believe
that
there
was
probable
cause,
the
language
of
burke
is
pure
dictum.
not
only
is
it
dictum,
it
has
no
application
to
the
present
case.
it
relies
on
another
california
supreme
court
case,
case
of
people
versus
roberts,
which
evolves
an
apartment.
now
let
me
quote
to
you
from
the
california
case.
in
roberts,
the
california
supreme
court
points
out
that
the
manager
testified
that
she
had
neither
authority
nor
permission
for
mrs.
higgins
to
enter
her
apartment.
there
was
no
claim
that
the
manger
had
authority
to
enter
the
roberts
apartment.
likewise
in
burke
itself
the
court
points
out
that
mere
fact
that
a
hotel
manager
does
not
import
an
authority
to
permit
the
police
to
enter
and
search
--
does
not
import
an
authority
to
permit
the
police
to
enter
and
search
the
rooms
of
her
guests.
therefore,
proof
that
the
police
were
let
in
by
the
manager
without
law
cannot
satisfy
the
burden
upon
the
prosecution
to
show
that
the
officers
reasonably
believed
in
good
faith
that
they
had
the
consent
of
an
authorized
person.
that
question
your
honors
is
not
really
before
this
court.
the
law
of
burke
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
position
we
take
here.
we
feel
california
law
is
quite
clear
that
the
facts
establish
that
the
hotel
or
innkeeper
had
authority
or
if
the
facts
establish
that
the
officers
in
good
faith
and
upon
good
reason
believed
that
the
hotel
keeper
had
such
authority,
then
the
search
is
proper.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
say
it
stems
from
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
stems
from
the
fact
that
under
california
law
the
innkeeper
has
control
of
all
of
the
premises.
he
has
control
over
the
hallways,
the
storerooms,
and
the
hotel
room.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
general
california
law.
we
cited
the
cases,
yes
dealing
with
the
–
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
the
general
common
law
applicable
to
innkeeper's
rights.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
sir,
but
i
think
we
need
not
argue
that
here.
i
think
that
we
can
argue
as
we
had
that
on
these
facts
the
permission
granted
was
reasonable.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
officers
searched
the
room.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
was
there.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
said
i
give
you
my
permission
to
search,
his
exact
language
mr.
justice
clark,
in
that
case
i
give
you
my
permission.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
we
say
that
it
may
--
we
also
say
that
in
this
case
the
conduct
of
the
innkeeper
was
indeed
itself
reasonable.
he
had
been
informed
on
very
good
cause
by
the
officers
that
a
guest
in
his
hotel,
an
ex-felon
had
a
weapon,
a
45.
i
think
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
into
that
room
for
the
protection
of
the
other
guests
to
search
for
that
45.
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
delegates
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
we
had
reasonable
cause
for
believing
that
he
possessed
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
fact
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
stoner
committed
the
robbery
with
a
45,
that
he
had
it
in
his
possession.
presumably
he
kept
that
weapon
and
i
think
experience
teaches
that
that
weapon
would
either
be
discarded
or
kept
in
the
place
where
he
was
then
staying.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
or
carried
on
his
person.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
to
defend
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
don't
think
we
have
to
defend
on
that,
i
think
we
can
defend
on
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
our
first
point
is
that
the
property
--
the
property
law
in
california
is
such
that
this
is
a
permissible
agreement
that
this
is
part
of
the
innkeeper's
rights,
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
don't
believe
they
fall
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
do
not
say
that
california
could
pass
a
law
stating
that
any
police
officer
could
search
a
hotel
room,
that
plainly
wouldn't
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right.
we
say
he
can
delegate
it
to
anyone.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
we
don't
believe
that,
that--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it's
correct.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
unreasonable.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
within
the
meaning
of
–
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
under
the
fourth,
and
under
the
fourteenth.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
do
not
contend
that
you
cannot
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
control
it,
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
we
need
not
go
that
far
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
i
would
be
compelled
to
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
now
–
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
has
not.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
case
of
people
versus
ambrose,
the
case
of
fox
versus
windemere,
which
we
have
cited?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
ambrose
really
goes
off
on
an
apparent
authority
doctrine.
it
says
that
the
permission
to
enter
the
hotel
room
granted
by
the
innkeeper
was
proper
because
the
officers
had
right
in
good
faith
to
rely
upon
their
belief
they
had
this
authority,
which
is
our
second
argument
here.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
criminal
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
other
cases
we
cite
are
not
directly
at
point.
it
is
true,
they
are
concerned
with
the
lien
laws,
with
the
right
of
the
landlord
or
the
innkeeper
to
maintain
certain
types
of
actions
for
removal
of
a
guest.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir,
we
feel
one
that
it
is
dictum;
two
that
it
plainly
states
that
there
are
no
facts
to
warrant
a
contrary
finding.
and
likewise
roberts
is
plainly
based
on
the
fact
that
there
are
no
facts
or
claim
of
authority
by
the
hotel
manager
or
really
the
apartment
manager,
that
was
an
apartment
case,
which
is
another
case.
also
petitioner
here
stated
that
the
case
of
chapman
versus
united
states
disposed
of
our
argument
concerning
good
faith.
let
me
read
you
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
there.
he
said
on
that
test,
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
a
police
officer
may
not
deem
adequate
the
authorization
of
a
landlord
to
enter
his
house
without
a
search
warrant,
where
he
has
solid
ground
for
believing
that
his
lessee
is
utilizing
the
house
as
an
illegal
distillery.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
not
at
all
unreasonable
not
to
charge
a
local
police
officer
with
knowledge
of
the
law
of
georgia
regarding
the
power
of
the
landlord
to
abate
a
nuisance
in
his
house.
apart
from
charging
the
policeman
with
knowledge
of
the
local
law
relating
to
the
landlord
and
tenant,
he
certainly
would
not
acquire
that
knowledge
by
reading
only
the
georgia
case
law.
i
submit
that,
that
very
argument
is
most
plainly
applicable
to
this
case
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
counsel
for
petitioner
and
counsel
for
the
state
as
to
what
the
applicable
state
law
is.
i
submit
that
the
police
officer
could,
in
good
faith,
rely
upon
the
statement
by
the
innkeeper
that
he
had
authority.
he
need
not
resolve
this
very
difficult
and
not
too
clear
question
of
the
hotel
keeper's
authority
and
his
good
faith
action
here
ought
not
result
in
a
technical
reversal
of
a
conviction.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
technical
area
in
the
introduction
of
the
evidence,
which
is
another
point.
the
violation
--
would
be
a
violation,
i
suppose
you
can
characterize
it
as
you
wish,
but
certainly
it
is
not
a
gross
violation
such
as
the
breaking
down
of
a
door
and
exploratory
search
only.
it's
a
good
faith
mistake
at
most.
a
violation,
yes
perhaps,
which
brings
me
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
a
good
faith
violation
yes
your
honor,
which
brings
me
to
what
i
deem
to
be
a
very
crucial
point.
let
me
touch
very
briefly
on
the
instrumentalities
question.
here
i
think
that
is
not
applicable.
you
need
not
reach
it.
number
one,
the
gun,
hat,
and
coat
were
instrumentalities.
they
were
a
disguise.
they
were
proper
subject
of
seizure.
further,
we
feel
that
this
doctrine
has
no
application
to
a
search
by
consent.
it
is
a
doctrine
which
is
applied
to
search
warrants.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
search
or
to
a
incidental
search,
for
example
terrace.
it
should
not
be
applied
to
a
consensual
search.
further,
we
feel
that
this
is
indeed
a
kind
of
technical
nicety.
another
area
of
great
confusion
that
ought
not
be
imported
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
cases
are
not
at
all
clear
as
to
what
is
the
means
in
instrumentality.
further,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
fourth
amendment
for
such
a
rule.
the
fourth
amendment
simply
prohibits
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
it
says
that
a
warrant
must
describe
with
particularity
the
persons,
the
places
to
be
searched
and
the
things
to
be
seized.
it
does
not
prescribe
the
things
to
be
seized.
it
requires
only
that
the
things
to
be
seized
be
described
with
particularity.
finally
let
me
reach
what
i
deem
to
be
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
they
could
have.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir.
i
say
sir
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
record
is
not
clear,
but
the
--
it
is
plain
from
the
sequence
of
events
that
they
were
occurring
very
rapidly,
that
they
discovered
the
notebook,
they
discovered
--
connected
this
man
up
as
a
ex-felon,
they
got
a
mug
shot,
they
went
to
the
clerks,
they
were
identified,
they
then
went
to
the
hotel
room,
but
i
say
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh,
they
did
stay
around
late,
that
is
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right
they
awaited
his
return.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
say
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
first
off
of
course
they
were
not
even
certain
that
he
was
not
perhaps
in
the
room,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
he
was
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
key
was
at
the
desk.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
felt
that
they
were
justified
and
based
on
the
permission
to
search.
now
granted
they
could
have
gotten
the
warrant
for
the
weapon.
however
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
sir,
but
the
law
--
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
every
search
to
be
made
with
a
search
warrant.
it
does
to
prescribe
that
at
all,
it
says
simply
there
shall
not
be
an
unreasonable
search.
it
does
not
preclude
the
practice
that
existed
in
that
day
and
now
that
a
search
maybe
made
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
or
that
a
search
might
be
made
by
consent.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
they
can
probably
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
if
the
arrest
is
proper
they
can
search
properly
as
an
incident
to
consent.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
as
an
incident
to
consent.
now
if
the
consent
had
been
refused,
obviously
they
would
have
two
courses
of
action
remaining,
one
to
await
his
return,
two
to
secure
a
search
warrant,
three
to
if
they
locate
him
in
las
vegas
to
arrest
him,
and
obtain
his
consent.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
we
feel
as
a
second
point,
that
even
if
we
are
incorrect
here,
that
they
had
--
the
officers
had
the
right
in
good
faith
to
rely
upon
the
representations
of
the
innkeeper
that
he
had
right
to
give
them
permission
to
search,
he
said
in
that
case
i
give
you
permission.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
said
in
that
case
i
give
you
permission.
i
think
the
reasonable
inference
for
any
person,
be
he
police
officer,
lawyer
or
judges
that
i
have
the
right
to
give
you
permission,
take
it.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes
your
honor
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
we
felt
that
the
california
law
giving
him
the
right
to
enter
in
that
situation
was
quiet
clear
and
presented
on
that
basis
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
implied
permission
you
are
talking
about
good
faith.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
distinction
is
i
am
sorry
i
--
the
distinction
is
the
distinction
i
have
been
attempting
to
make
here
which
is
a
distinction
in
roberts
california
case
and
in
chapman.
an
apartment
the
right
of
a
landlord
and
tenant,
there
is
no
contention
here
that
these
doctrines
apply
to
an
apartment.
the
law
of
california
is
different
in
reference
to
an
apartment.
to
put
it,
an
apartment
is
a
home,
a
home
is
your
castle,
but
a
hotel
room
is
not
a
home
that's
the
gist
of
our
--
the
distinction
between
our
arguments
here.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
not
that
clear.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
this
is
the
distillation
of
those
cases
your
honor.
there
is
no
case
that
says
it
that
directly.
now
i
would
like
to
put
my
remaining
time
on
what
i
concede
to
be
the
most
important
question
here.
if
you
find
that
this
is
--
that
was
improper
search
whether
or
not
california
in
reviewing
this
case
can
apply
its
rule
of
harmless
error.
now
california
in
1911,
1914
adopted
in
its
constitution
a
rule
requiring
that
the
court
review
all
of
the
evidence,
the
entire
record
and
reverse
the
case
only,
it
would
result
in
miscarriage
of
justice.
now
this
accords
with
the
development
of
the
federal
law,
in
the
same
--
at
the
same
time.
let
me
read
to
you
the
language
of
from
(inaudible)
versus
us
discussing
this
development
which
parallels
the
development
of
article
6
section
4.1/2,
quoting
from
the
trial
judge
this
court
said,
the
courts
of
review
tower
above
the
trials
of
criminal
cases
is
impregnable
powers
said
to
those
of
technicality.
so
great
is
the
threat
of
reversal
that
criminal
trials
became
gains
for
sowing
reversible
errors
in
the
record.
this
court
again
speaking
said,
the
object
of
this
reform
was
simple;
to
substitute
judgment
for
automatic
application
of
rules,
to
preserve
or
review
as
a
check
upon
arbitrary
action
and
essential
unfairness
in
the
trial,
but
at
the
same
time
to
make
the
process
perform
that
function
without
giving
men
fairly
convicted
the
multiplicity
of
loopholes
which
any
highly
rigid
and
minutely
detailed
scheme
of
errors
will
reflect
in
a
printed
record.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
policy
of
mapp
versus
ohio
does
not
require
a
state
to
adopt
the
rule
of
reversible
error.
it's
an
attenuation
at
best
of
an
indirect
enforcement
of
a
very
important
constitutional
right,
well
i
stand
here
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
two
differences.
first
the
theory
of
coerced
confession
cases
is
that
the
constitutional
violation
is
the
introduction
of
that
confession.
it's
not
the
obtaining
of
the
confession,
it's
the
introduction.
the
courts
say
that
this
permeates
the
trial
with
unfairness,
secondly
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
secondly
your
honor
i
think
that
this
is
true
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
you've
stated
that,
and
i
think
that
your
honor
that
in
the
case
of
a
confession
the
very
nature
of
the
evidence
is
such
that,
that
it
would
under
the
test
of
this
court
or
the
test
of
the
state
courts
have
a
that
kind
of
an
impact
upon
the
jury,
which
should
result
in
reversible
error.
now
what
is
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
oh
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
that
it
did,
but
here
let
us
take
--
let's
give
you
an
example
that
could
constructed
from
this
case.
let's
assume
that
the
only
evidence
here
that
was
illegally
obtained
assuming
that
it
was,
was
the
coat.
the
coat
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
here,
the
prosecution
witnesses
testifying
that
it
appeared
to
be
the
coat,
the
co-defendant
who
had
pleaded
guilty
testifying
that
it
was
not
the
coat
used
in
the
robbery.
i
submit
that
this
would
have
no
impact
upon
the
judgment.
i
submit
that
this
would
be
a
reversal
based
upon
a
mere
technicality.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no
it's
held
that
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct
your
honor
sorry,
right.
