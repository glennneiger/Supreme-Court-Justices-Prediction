mr.

mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith,
i
go
to
california
every
opportunity
i
have
and
much
of
the
time
i
stay
in
hotels.
do
you
mean
to
tell
us
the
law
of
--
property
law
of
california
is
such
that
every
time
i
go
to
a
hotel
in
california,
sign
the
register,
and
i'm
assigned
a
room,
that
i
agree
by
doing
that,
that
the
hotel
has
the
right
to
go
in
and
search
my
room
whenever
it
wants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
just
ask
you
that
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
affirmative.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
tell
me
if
that
has
ever
been
decided
directly
by
the
state
of
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
nearest
case
you
have
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
ambrose
hold?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
a
case
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
other
case
besides
ambrose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you're
of
the
opinion
that
burke
does
not
cut
against
--
cut
across
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
on
that
score,
you
don't
contend
this
is
in
furtherance
of
lawful
arrest,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
why
couldn't
the
police
reasonably
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
search
that
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
do
you
mean
that
it
is
reasonable
for
them
to
get
a
search
warrant
they
can
disregard
it
and
say
we'll
just
search
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
they
get
a
search
warrant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
stayed
in
the
room
for
a
full
day
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
and
around
the
room.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
in
the
room
as
i
understood
it,
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
around
or
in
the
room
they
stayed
for
a
full
day,
and
why
in
that
length
of
time
shouldn't
they
have
gotten
a
search
warrant,
before
they
searched
the
room?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
went
--
they
searched
--
they
looked
in
and
about
the
room
and
he
wasn't
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
why
--
if
they
wanted
to
search
the
room,
why
couldn't
they
have
gotten
the
search
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
justice
wouldn't
have
suffered
at
all
in
the
meantime
they
if
had,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
the
question
of
whether
they
have
the
time
to
get
a
search
warrant,
doesn't
that
goes
to
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
an
immediate
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
wasn't
any
â€“
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
wasn't
an
arrest
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
entire
case
then
rests
upon
consent,
if
that
clerk
didn't
have
the
right
to
give
it
to
you,
you
are
out
of
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
dempsey,
i
want
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
accepted
this
assignment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
if
it
were
not
for
lawyers
who
undertake
these
services
like
yourself,
the
rights
of
indigent
defendants
would
be
a
mere
theory
of
justice
rather
than
justice
itself
and
the
court
is
always
comforted
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
do
what
you
have
done
in
this
particular
case,
and
without
regard
to
the
manner
which
these
cases
are
decided,
we
are
profoundly
grateful
to
lawyers
who
undertake
the
service
you
did
in
this
case.
