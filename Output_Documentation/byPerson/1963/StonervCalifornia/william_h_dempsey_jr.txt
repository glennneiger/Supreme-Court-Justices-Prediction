mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
another
search
and
seizure
case
that
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
the
second
district
of
the
state
of
california.
it
involves
applicability
of
the
decisions
in
mapp
versus
ohio
and
ker
versus
california
to
this
particular
state
prosecution.
the
search
and
seizure
took
place
in
a
hotel
room
that
belonged
to
petitioner.
the
questions
stated
very
generally
are
these.
first
whether
the
search
and
seizure
were
valid
because
incident
to
a
valid
arrest;
second
whether
the
search
and
seizure
are
somehow
validated
by
the
consent
to
the
search
and
seizure
that
were
given
by
the
hotel
clerk;
third
whether
assuming
that
the
search
might
have
been
valid,
the
seizure
was
nonetheless
invalid
because
the
items
that
were
sized
were
neither
means
nor
instrumentalities
for
the
commission
of
crime,
nor
contraband,
nor
the
fruits
of
a
crime
and
finally,
assuming
that
the
search
or
the
seizure
was
invalid,
the
admission
into
evidence
of
the
items
that
were
seized
was
mere
harmless
error
and
then
the
further
question
of
course
whether
if
that
be
so,
the
conviction
should
affirmed
or
reversed.
the
facts
that
bear
upon
these
issues
are
not
particularly
complicated.
they
may
be
summarized
i
think
something
like
this.
the
crime
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
was
a
crime
of
robbery.
the
robbery
was
of
a
grocery
store
in
the
city
of
monrovia,
california.
it
took
place
about
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
of
october
25,
1960.
two
men
committed
the
robbery.
there
were
two
eyewitnesses
to
the
crime,
employees
in
the
grocery
store.
shortly
after
the
police
of
monrovia
started
their
investigation
of
the
crime,
the
manager
of
the
grocery
store
turned
over
to
them
a
check
book
and
a
deposit
book,
a
bank
deposit
book,
which
were
traced
to
the
petitioner.
the
check
book
reveled
that
two
checks
had
very
recently
been
drawn
out
to
a
hotel
called
mayfair
hotel
in
the
city
of
pomona,
california.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
they
had
been
found
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
parking
lot,
adjacent
to
the
grocery
store.
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
the
grocery
store's
parking
lot,
but
in
any
event
a
parking
lot
adjacent
to
the
grocery
store
and
shortly
--
they
have
been
found
shortly
after
the
crime.
that's
about
as
clear
the
record
is
on
that.
the
monrovia
police
contacted
the
pomona
police.
they
got
a
mug
shot
of
petitioner.
they
found
that
he
had
a
prior
record.
he
had
been
convicted
a
murder
and
robbery
before.
they
showed
the
mug
shot
to
the
two
eyewitnesses,
who
said
that
this
looked
like
one
of
the
man
who
had
committed
the
crime,
but
they
wanted
to
see
him
in
person.
so
the
monrovia
police
went
to
pomona,
two
days
after
the
crime
on
the
evening
of
october
27.
they
conferred
with
the
pomona
police
for
a
while
and
then
about
11
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
october
27,
two
members
of
the
pomona
force
and
two
members
of
the
monrovia
force
went
to
the
mayfair
hotel.
now
what
happened
then
is
critically
important
in
this
case
and
so
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
reading
the
pertinent
extracts
verbatim
from
the
record.
this
is
one
of
the
officers
testifying
at
the
trail.
he
said
--
this
is
on
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice,
this
is
one
page
--
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
page
71,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
that
page,
and
i'm
going
to
skip
some
of
the
intervening
material,
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
whole
thing,
i'm
just
picking
out
portions
of
it.
and
i'm
starting
at
about
two-thirds
down
toward
the
end
of
the
line
where
there
is
a
long
answer,
right
at
the
end
the
line
it
starts,
we
approached
the
desk,
the
night
clerk
and
asked
him
if
there
was
party
by
the
name
of
the
joey
l.
stoner
living
at
the
hotel.
he
checked
his
records
and
stated,
yes,
there
is.
and
we
asked
him
what
room
he
was
in.
he
stated
he
was
in
room
404,
but
he
was
out
at
this
time.
we
asked
him
how
he
knew
that
he
was
out.
he
stated
that
the
hotel
regulations
required
that
the
key
to
the
room
would
be
placed
in
the
mail
box
each
time
they
left
the
hotel.
the
key
was
in
the
mail
box,
that
he
therefore
knew
he
was
out
of
the
room.
we
asked
him
if
he
would
give
us
permission
to
enter
the
room,
explaining
our
reasons
for
this.
question
-
what
reasons
did
you
explain
to
the
clerk?
answer
-
we
explained
that
we
were
there
to
make
an
arrest
of
a
man
who
had
possibly
committed
a
robbery
in
the
city
of
monrovia,
and
that
we
were
concerned
about
the
fact
that
he
had
a
weapon.
he
stated,
in
this
case,
i
will
be
more
than
happy
to
give
you
permission
and
i
will
take
you
directly
to
the
room.
then
moving
on
down,
we
left
one
detective
in
the
lobby,
and
detective
oliver,
officer
collins,
and
myself,
along
with
the
night
clerk,
got
on
the
elevator
and
proceeded
to
the
fourth
floor,
and
went
to
room
404.
the
night
clerk
placed
a
key
in
the
lock,
unlocked
the
door,
and
says,
be
my
guest.
what
did
you
do,
question?
answer
-
we
entered
the
room
and
the
first
thing
that
was
observed
was
pair
of
horn-rimmed
glasses
lying
on
a
desk
in
the
northeast
corner
of
the
room.
i
picked
the
glasses
up
and
looked
at
them
and
noted
that
they
answered
the
description
of
the
glasses
described
by
one
of
the
victims
and
then
he
identifies
people's
exhibit
number
three
as
the
glasses,
and
then
continuing
down
at
the
bottom
of
page,
then
what
else
did
you
do,
question?
answer
-
then
begin
a
systematic
search
of
the
room
and
noted
that
certain
clothing
in
the
room
was
along
the
same
description
as
given
by
the
victim
or
the
victims
and
during
the
check
of
the
bureau,
officer
collins
pulled
the
drawers
from
the
bureau
to
check
them.
the
bottom
drawer
when
he
pulled
it
completely
out
we
observed
a
gun
lying
on
the
floor,
which
is
the
gun
which
is
now
that's
--
and
he
identifies
it
as
people's
exhibit
number
one.
and
the
along
side
of
this
gun
was
some
toilet
paper,
white
toilet
paper,
which
we
unwrapped
and
it
showed
a
number
of
cartridges
for
a
45
automatic
and
then
he
identifies
that
as
one
of
the
people's
exhibits.
and
then
down
further
on
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
page,
question
-
was
there
anything
else
discovered
in
the
room?
answer
-
there
were
certain
address
books
and
other
miscellaneous
evidence
that
was
obtained,
yes.
then
he
identifies
the
clip
as
one
of
people's
exhibits
and
then
over
on
page
74
he
testifies
that,
another
one
the
people's
exhibits,
a
coat
was
also
recovered
from
the
room.
then
he
concludes,
well
at
this
time
we
determine
that
this
would
be
the
suspect
in
our
particular
robbery
and
we
maintained
an
observation
of
the
room
or
in
the
room,
my
partner
and
myself
until
approximately
noon
the
following
day
which
was
the
28th
of
october.
then
on
noon
of
the
following
day,
that
is
about
12
or
13
hours
after
the
search
and
seizure,
the
police
left
the
room
because
the
petitioner
had
not
returned.
the
petitioner
was
apprehended
noon
the
next
day,
that
is
noon
on
october
29,
about
37
hours
after
the
search
and
seizure
and
in
a
different
state
in
the
city
of
las
vegas,
nevada,
apparently
by
the
las
vegas
authorities.
the
pomona
police
went
to
las
vegas.
they
brought
the
petitioner
back
and
three
days
roughly
after
the
arrest
and
before
he
had
been
brought
before
a
magistrate
for
preliminary
hearing,
before
he
had
seen
any
attorneys,
or
any
friends,
or
any
relatives;
he
confessed
to
one
of
the
detectives.
now
i
should
note
at
this
point
that
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
that
confess
is
not
before
the
court.
it
was
expressly
excluded
in
this
court's
order
granting
the
writ
of
certiorari.
this
brings
us
then
to
the
trial
and
when
i
describe
what
happen
at
trial
i
would
like
at
the
same
time
to
deal
with
the
question
of
so
called
harmless
error.
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
to
this
question
in
this
case
and
therefore
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
left
open
in
fahy
versus
connecticut,
whether
in
any
event,
even
assuming
that
the
error
was
only
harmless
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed
or
reversed.
now
we
deal
with
that
further
question
in
our
brief,
but
we
don't
add
anything
particularly
to
the
discussion
on
the
fahy
versus
connecticut
case.
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
relied
primarily
upon
the
testimony
of
the
two
eyewitnesses
to
the
crime
who
identified
petitioner
as
one
of
the
robbers.
the
testimony
of
the
alleged
accomplice
who
had
turned
state's
evidence
and
who
had
plead
guilty
and
was
sentenced,
and
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
who
testified
with
respect
to
the
confession
and
the
search
and
seizure.
the
defense
on
the
other
hand
relied
primarily
upon
the
testimony
of
two
men
or
one
woman
and
one
man,
who
said
that
the
petitioner
had
been
with
them
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
they
also
of
course
attempted
to
attack
the
credibility
of
the
alleged
accomplice
on
the
theory
that
he
had
--
he
was
testifying
in
exchange
for
the
light
sentence
which
he
had
admittedly
got,
and
they
tried
to
shake
the
identification
testimony
of
the
eyewitness.
so
that
basically
the
conviction
turned
upon
a
resolution
of
the
problem
of
credibility
by
the
jury
and
in
attempting
to
shore
up
the
credibility
of
the
eyewitnesses,
the
state
relied
very
heavily
upon
these
articles
that
had
been
seized
from
the
room;
that
is
the
gun,
the
coat
and
the
eye
glasses.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
they
were
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
let's
see.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
my
opponent
is
helping
me.
he
tells
me
that
they
were
admitted
on
page
75
of
the
record
and
he
is
quite
accurate
in
that
respect.
the,
what
the
prosecutor
did
was
to,
was
to
show
the
gun
and
the
glasses
and
the
jacket
to
the
eyewitnesses
and
asked
them
whether
this
appeared
to
be
the
gun
that
the
petitioner
had
used
or
that
the
robber
had
used
and
--
the
gun
and
the
eye
glasses
and
the
jacket
that
he
had
worn
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
they
said,
yes
they
appear
to
be.
the
--
shails,
that
is
the
alleged
accomplice
testified
to
the
same
effect
except
i
--
my
collection
is
that
he
testified
that
the
jacket
was
in
fact
was
not
the
jacket
that
the
petitioner
had
been
wearing,
he
did
identify
the
gun
however
and
the
police
then
testified
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
search
and
the
fact
these
items
have
been
obtained
from
petitioner's
room.
now
as
i
understand
the
test
under
fahy,
it
is
simply
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
these
items
into
evidence
contribute,
it
may
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
and
in
these
circumstances
we
submit
that
there
can't
be
any
genuine
doubt
that
they
did.
the
state
suggests,
as
i
understand
it,
first
that
there
was
a
plenty
of
evidence
otherwise
but
we
think
that
that's
been
squarely
put
aside
in
the
fahy
case,
that
kind
of
a
test
and
they
suggest
secondly
that
the
prosecutor
could
have
used
items
which
were
like
these
items
but
not
really
the
genuine
article
that
is
sort
of
mock-ups
and
put
the
same
questions
to
the
witnesses
but
that
misses
the
whole
point.
the
impact
of
this
evidence
lay
in
the
fact
that
as
the
police
testified
it
had
been
taken
petitioner's
hotel
room
thereby
the
state
was
able
to
link
the
petitioner
with
the
crime
by
objective
evidence
that
had
been
seized
from
that
hotel
room.
now
that's
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
question
of
harmless
error
in
this
case.
i
turn
then
to
very
briefly
i
think
unless
the
court
wishes
me
to
pursue
it
to
the
question
of
search
incident
to
arrest.
now
this
was
the
ground
upon
which
the
lower
court
based
its
decision.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
i,
if
i
am,
if
i
am
free
to
rely
entirely
upon
the
concession
of
the
state
it
certainly
isn't
and
of
course
it's
open
to
the
court
to
decide,
but
the
state
now
does
concede
and
they
didn't
argue
in
the
court
below
that
the
search
was
incident
to
arrest,
it
was
37
hours
after
the
arrest
and
in
a
different
state.
this
brings
me
then
to
what
i
take
to
be
the
principle
argument
of
the
state
and
it
turns
upon
the
consent
to
the
search
that
was
given
by
the
hotel
clerk.
now
petitioner
of
course
didn't
consent,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
the
room
clerk
said,
be
my
guest.
i
observe
at
the
outset
what
i
take
to
be
obvious
and
that
is
that
if
the
state's
argument
is
accepted,
it
has
the
most
far
reaching
implications.
now
there
are
two
branches
to
the
argument;
the
first
is
that
the
room
clerk
as
a
matter
of
state
law
had
actual
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
and
the
second
branch
is
that,
assuming
arguendo
he
didn't
have
actual
authority,
he
had
apparent
authority
and
therefore
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
to
rely
upon
this
consent.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that
he
had
checked
out
of
his
room,
oh
no
mr.
justice
harlan,
no
evidence
that
he
had
checked
out
at
all.
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
record
here
that
that
he
was
paid
up
current.
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case,
no.
if
the
actual
authority
argument
is
accepted
it
means
that
every
hotel
in
the
state
of
california
is
open
to
a
search
without
a
warrant,
solely
within
the
discretion
of
a
hotel
clerk.
and
if
the
apparent
authority
argument
is
accepted,
it
means
that
every
hotel
in
the
united
states
to
open
to
that
kind
of
a
search,
at
least
so
for
as
i
can
see.
i
don't
perceive
any
limitations
on
this
argument
in
the
state's
say,
in
the
state's
brief
and
none
occurs
to
me.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
i'll
--
i
do
argue
that
state
law
is
not
bad
with
respect
to
actual
authority.
i
do
argue
that
and
let
me
turn
to
that
immediately.
the
--
now
if
there
were
a
state
statute
that
said
something
like
every
hotel
clerk
in
the
state
of
california
has
this
kind
of
authority
i
would
think
that
that
would
pose
a
very
serious
constitutional
question.
it
would
be
--
it
would
amount
to
frontal
assault
upon
the
protection
that
would
otherwise
be
accorded
by
the
fourth
amendment
of
hotel
rooms.
now
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
it
is.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
you
do,
you
do
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
certainly
do
and
that's
what
this
court
held
or
stated
at
least
in
the
case
of
jeffers,
united
states
versus
jeffers,
which
we
submit
as
controlling
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
very
particularized
state
statute
bearing
on
the
subject
which
as
i
say,
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
question.
now
what
the
court,
what
the
court
said
in
jeffers,
in
circumstances
that
seem
to
me
to
be
entirely
indistinguishable
from
those
here
was
that
as
you
pointed
out,
guests
in
hotels
have
impliedly
consented
to
entry
by
the
hotel
to
service,
to
repair,
and
i
suppose
that
the
court
might
have
gone
further
in
jeffers
and
said
that
if
there
is
a,
if
there
is
a
ruckus
going
on
in
the
room
it
maybe
that
the
hotel
management
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
make
people
be
quite.
but
the
court
held
in
jeffers
that
that
kind
of
implicit
consent
that
arises
out
of
the
nature
of
the
contract
between
the
guest
and
the
hotel
management
does
not
extend
to
authorizing
the
management
to
consent
to
a
search
and
seizure
without
a
warrant
by
the
police.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
now
the
house
detective
mr.
justice
goldberg
it
seems
to
me
is
there
--
now
he
doesn't
--
i
don't
think
he
has
any
authority
different
than
that
of
hotel
management.
he
is
simply
the,
the
person
in
the
hotel
establishment
that
can
take
whatever
action
the
management
can
take.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
a
circumstance
of
a
fight
or
something
like
that
where
peace
is
being
disturbed,
it's
a
hotel
detective
that
exercises
the
right
to
go
into
the
room
and
make
them
be
quiet.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
they
have
someone
on
their
staff
who
is
labeled
house
detective
carries
us
any
further
than
we
would
be
otherwise.
the
jeffers
case
i
suggest
is
controlling
here
at
least
in
the
absence
of
some
unusual
state
law
doctrine
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
after
all
is
a,
at
least
as
i
view
it
is
a
question
of
wavier
of
a
constitutional
right.
now
i
don't
say
that
yes
that
hotels
can't
waiver
their
constitutional
right.
if
a
hotel
wishes
to
retain
to
itself
this
kind
of
authority
i
assume
they
can
put
it
in
a
contract
that
you
sign
when
you
come
in,
or
they
might
put
a
sign
on
the
--
along
side
the
desk
when
you
register
saying
that
this
hotel
reserves
this
kind
of
a
right.
they
might
not
get
as
much
business
as
they
otherwise
did
and
presumably
that's
why
they
don't
do
it,
or
one
of
the
reasons,
but
that
isn't
this
case.
you
have
to
in
some
way
imply
consent
in
circumstances
that
are
not
distinguishable
from
jeffers
and
i
would
add
are
not
distinguishable
from
lustig
either,
although
the
question
was
not,
was
not
discussed
at
any
length
in
lustig,
but
certainly
the
holding
of
lustig
is
that
a
hotel
clerk
does
not
have
this
kind
of
authority.
i
turn
then
to,
to
what
is
asserted
to
be
a
state
law
which
might
overcome
the
barrier
that
the
state
faces
in
view
of
lustig
and
jeffers.
now
this
state
law,
we
have
examined
the
cases
carefully
that
the
state
cites,
this
state
law
doesn't
bear
in
any
respect
it
seems
to
us
upon
the
problem.
not
only
are
the
decisions
that
the
state
cites,
not
search
and
seizure
cases,
but
they
don't
even
go
in
any
respect
to
the
right
of
hotel
management
to
enter
a
room.
they
deal
with
the
relatively
esoteric
questions
or
maybe
that's
the
wrong
word,
but
certainly
unrelated
questions
such
as
whether
hotel
management
has
a
right
to
keep
a
guest's
bags
when
he
leaves
without
paying
his
bill,
whether
they
have
the
right
to
bring
an
unlawful
detainer
action
to
get
him
out
of
the
room
if
he
doesn't
pay.
now
these
are
the
kind
of
state
doctrines
that
the
state
relies
upon
here,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
they
simply
don't
meet
the
problem.
rather
these
are,
these
are
the
kind
of
local
law
doctrines
that
were
involved
in
a
case
like
chapman.
well,
they
don't
even
go
as
far
as
chapman,
but
in
chapman
the
court
will
recall
the
landlord,
the
landlord
went
to
the
lease
premises
on
a
sunday
morning
wanting
to
invite
people
to
go
to
church,
he
had
known
them
before,
he
smelled
mash,
he
thought
that
there
was
a
distillery
operating
which
indeed
there
was.
the
local
police
came,
and
he
said,
well
if
it's
what
i
think
it
is,
you
have
my
authority
to
go
in.
the
police
went
in
through
a
window
there
was
still
operating,
they
seized
and
this
court
struck
down
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
search
and
seizure
had
been
unconstitutional.
now
in
this
court,
the
government
relied
in
part
upon
an
asserted
local
law
or
common
law
doctrine
that
gives
a
landlord
the
right
to
enter
premises
to
view
waste
and
one
of
the
responses
that
this
court
made
to
that
argument
was
that
this
kind
of
local
law
that's
rooted
in
the
property
law
differences
as
respects
the
rights
of
guests
and
licensees
and
invitees
the
kind
of
distinction
that
the
court
had
put
aside
in
the
jones
case
in
dealing
with
problem
of
standards
simply
could
not
be
relied
upon
in
order
to
justify
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
don't
even
have
to
deal
with
a
situation
as
troublesome,
if
it
was
troublesome,
as
the
court
did
in
chapman
because
at
least
in
chapman,
the
local
law
doctrine
that
was
relied
upon
had
to
do
with
the
rights
of
the
property,
the
person
who
had
interest
in
the
property
to
enter
to
premises
and
here
the
local
law
doctrines
don't
even
bear
upon
that.
and
i
should
add
that
the
one
case
that
seems
to
us
to
be
clearly
in
point
in
the
various
cases
cited
by
the
state
is
the
one
called
people
versus
burke.
now
there
the
question
was
whether
a
hotel
clerk
had
or
a
hotel
management
had
apparent
authority
to
consent
to
a
search.
the
court
held
that
it
--
that
hotel
management
did
not
have
that
kind
of
authority
and
certainly
implicit
in
this
holding
was
the
holding
that
they
didn't
have
actual
authority
because
this
is
the
further
problem
if
there
is
no
actual
authority
then
you
go
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
apparent
authority.
so
that
the
one
case
it
seems
to
us
to
be
clearly
in
point
negates
the
kind
of
local
law
doctrine
that's
contended
before
by
the
state
here.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes,
it
is
in
my
reply
brief
mr.
justice
black
yes.
it's
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you.
yes
quoting
from
burke
the
mere
fact
that
a
person
is
a
hotel
manager
does
not
import
an
authority
to
permit
the
police
to
enter
and
search
the
rooms
of
their
guests.
there
is
no
case
cited
by
the
state
that
cuts
across
burke.
there
are
some
state
court
opinions,
one
in
particular
called
ambrose
which
seems
inconsistent
with
burke
with
respect
to
apparent
authority,
but
there
is
none
that
cuts
into
this
burke
holding
with
respect
to
actual
authority.
now
the
apparent
authority
argument,
i
think
i've
dealt
with
it
at
about
the
same
time
as
i
dealt
with
the
actual
authority
argument
because
if
there
was
no
apparent
authority
in
jeffers
and
if
there
was
no
apparent
authority
in
chaplin,
there's
certainly
is
no
apparent
authority
here.
to
a
certain
--
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
well
i
don't
know
that
i'd
be
willing
to
concede
that.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
he
granted
permission
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
california
they
make
a
distinction
here.
they
make
the,
as
i
read
their
cases,
they
make
the
person
who
let
them
into
the
room
get
on
the
stand
and
say
yes
i
thought
i
had
authority
so
that
i
think
i
would
be
cutting
across
california
decisions
even
if
i
went
as
far
as
to
–
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
well
i
think
that
--
of
course
it's
the
state's
argument,
i
am
reluctant
to
paraphrase
it
for
them.
as
i
understand
their
argument
it's
not
really
an
apparent
authority
argument.
that
sounds
like
agency
law
problems
and
i
would
suppose
there
isn't
apparent
authority
here
in
that
sense
because
the
defendant
did
nothing
to
contribute
to
this
so
called
apparent
authority
except
rent
a
room.
so
that
i
should
think
what
they
mean
is
that
when
somebody
like
a
room
clerk
says
all
right
come
on
in,
it's
reasonable
for
the
police
to
go
in
and
assume
that
he
has
authority
even
though
he
doesn't.
now
that's
the
heart
of
the
argument
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
on
this
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
yes
i
would
mr.
justice
black,
i
would.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
would,
i
would.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
that's
correct.
this
as
i
say
this
is
a
not
here
problem
certainly
state
law
bears
upon
the
fourth
amendment,
if
state
law
provides
if
you
lose
your
property
rights
in
a
room,
if
you
don't
pay
the
rent,
well
that
has
a
direct
effect
on
whether
that
room
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
but
a
state
statute
that
would
be
expressly
aimed
at
cutting
back
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
would
challenge
yes,
i
say
the
issue
is
not
here
but
i
certainly
would.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i
am
–
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
oh!
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
think
that
–
i
don't
think
the
state
asserts
that
there
is
a
rule
such
as
the
one
described
by
mr.
justice
black
or
i
would
have
addressed
myself
more
directly
to
the
problem
that
he
raises.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
i,
that
would
be
my
argument,
my
argument
would
be
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
jeffers
and
to
lustig
and
to
chapman.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
not
in
jeffers
or
lustig
mr.
justice
black
it
was
raised
in
chapman
of
course
in
the
context
of
a
tenant
landlord
rather
than
hotel
guest,
but
the
argument
that
i
make
would
be
the
same.
and
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
noting
in
the
connection
mr.
justice
stewart
with
respect
to
the
so
called
apparent
authority
doctrine
that
in
chapman,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
raised
this
argument,
not
in,
not
calling
it
apparent
authority,
but
speaking
in
terms
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
action
of
the
police
officers
and
rejected
it,
so
that
in
that
case
the
matter
was
squarely
put.
now
i
have
got
a
few
minutes
i
would
like
to
touch
just
briefly
on
this
question
of
the
character
of
the
items
that
are
--
that
were
seized
here.
it's
our
position
that
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
search
was
valid
but
the
seizure
was
invalid
because
in
no
circumstances
could
the
glasses
or
the
jacket
be
considered
means
or
instrumentalities
of
committing
a
crime
or
fruits
of
the
crime
at
least
absent
some
question
of
disguise.
now
i
think
the
state
maybe
intimating
that
there
is
a
problem.
i
have
not
cited
in
my
brief
but
i
would
like
to
cite
now
references
to
page
24
of
the
transcript
in
which
one
of
the
witnesses
said
that
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
the
hat.
and
page
20
--
page
30
of
the
transcript
in
which
the
witness
said
that
there
was
nothing
unique
about
the
horn-rimmed
glasses.
now
the
hat
is
not
in
question
i
don't
want
to
misstate
--
overstate
my
case
here,
but
--
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
there
is
anything
about
the
jacket
that
could
have
been
a
disguise
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
about
the
glasses
or
the
hat
and
no
indication
that
there
is
any
about
the
jacket,
there
wasn't
any
disguise
question
in
this
case.
and
in
those
circumstances
i
say
that
this,
these
items
simply
don't
meet
the
test
of
the
boyd
case.
now,
the
state
says
well
even
so
the
boyd
rule
is
one
only
of
evidence
and
not
a
constitutional
law
upon
that
we
rely
on
the
cases.
we
think
that
the
boyd
is
quite
claimed.
this
is
an
important
ingredient
of
fourth
amendment
law.
it's
always
been
regarded
that
way,
we
think
by
the
court
as
late
as
the
able
case
and
if
the
state
thinks
that
there
could
be
a
better
rule,
we
suggest
that
foreclosed
to
that,
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
rule
of
ker
versus
california,
this
doctrine
as
an
important
ingredient
of
fourth
amendment
law
is
to
be
applied
to
the
states.
the
question
of
means
of
instrumentalities
and
contraband
does
have
a
policy
basis.
it's
spelled
out
in
the
boyd
case
i
suppose
with
the
most
clarity.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
it
sheds
light
on
what's
reasonable
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
provisions
yet
the
state
normally
doesn't
have
a
right
to
take
your
property
away
from
you
and
the
boyd
case
said
that
--
and
it
has
been
repeated
in
cases
since
then
that
normally
taking
a
man's
property
from
him
and
using
it
in
evidence
against
him
is
tantamount
to
forcing
him
to
testify
against
himself
so
that
there
must
be
something
over
and
above
this
kind
of
interest
that
gives
the
state
the
right
to
seize
the
items
in
question.
now
historically
contraband
means
instrumentalities
of
committing
a
crime
fruits
of
a
crime
all
of
these
were
subject
to
seizure
not
because
they
would
then
be
used
against
a
man,
but
simply
because
the
man
had
no
possessory
right
in
these
particular
items.
and
in
consequence
that's
the
policy
basis
the
state
as
i
say
may
disagree
with
it,
but
it
--
we
submit
that
it's
a
substantial
one.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
dempsey,
jr.
thank
you.
