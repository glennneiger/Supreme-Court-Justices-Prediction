justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
--
maybe
i
could
understand
that
the
negroes
also
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
the
rule,
what
i
have
in
mind
is,
is
that
the
rule
of
law
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
effect
here?
they
were
completely
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
notice
was
given
to
the
trespasser?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
it
make
then
by
the
time
that
the
act,
they
knew
they
didn't
want?
i
thought
the
crime
was
being
there
or
going
in
as
to
it's
warned
not
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
statute
doesn't
make
that
a
crime,
does
it,
either
--
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
crime
is,
and
i
would
think
those
elements
are
necessary
that
he
goes
on
it
as
he
has
been
warned
not
to
do
so
by
the
owner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
his
desire
that
in
general,
people
not
(inaudible)
there
be
to
certain
group
that
he
might
change
his
mind.
the
statute,
i
must
--
i
must
confess
i'm
impressed
somewhat,
by
my
home
state
statute
like
this,
does
make
clearly
a
crime
going
on
there
if
he
has
been
warned
not
to
do
so.
supposed
he
knew
all
along
that
they
didn't
want
it
but
they
didn't
tell
him
not
to.
can
you
stretch
that
to
make
it
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
acute
issue
in
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question
as
to
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
supreme
court
decided,
considered
that
question
even
thought
it
was
not
raised,
do
they
have
the
power
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
makes
any
difference
on
whether
or
not
we
should
consider
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
point
even
though
they
had
chosen
for
somebody
who's
not
made
clear
to
refuse
to
pass
on
it,
although
they
had
(inaudible)
this
or
under
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
right
in
(inaudible)
if
that
is
the
case,
i
just
got
a
situation
that
if
we
did
consider
then
the
other
case
by
the
court
below,
happen
to
find
this
but
refused
to
pass
it
on
this
because
the
court
did
not
--
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
did
not
pass
on
it
because
for
some
reasons
it
didn't
want
to.
it
has
an
outstanding
of
decision
against
one
and
for
the
other,
on
precisely
the
same
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
have
a
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
there
is
another
case
in
which
your
court
waives
this
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
considered
it
despite
that
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
they
have
considered
it
when
it
was
raised
later?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
if
they
present
that
question
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
present
it
later
on?
as
i
understand,
it's
never
been
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
we've
got
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
are
--
you
say
that
the
--
the
law
of
south
carolina
at
the
time
this
occurred,
but
then
a
restaurant
to
serve
people
or
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
legally
or
unconstitutional,
was
that
alone
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
required
--
made
it
a
criminal
offense
or
imposed
any
kind
of
duty
on
this
restaurant
owner
who
refused
from
serving
these
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
is
it,
could
it
arguably
be
made
that
the
owner
couldn't
be
required
to
try
to
distinguish
between
a
restaurant
that
was
in
--
part
of
the
carrier
that
others
was
not?
in
other
words,
how
did
he
know
that
he
wasn't
violating
that
law
if
he
let
them
into?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
presume
that
if
the
law
did
bar
it,
state
law,
you
would
say
he
is
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
if
it's
unconstitutional
which
is
on
the
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
said
in
peterson
that
--
that
i
recall
it?
we
would
not
try
to
get
in
to
the
middle
ages
of
the
person
who
know
whether
he
was
prompted
by
the
law
or
was
not
and
i
presume
that
by
the
fact
conversely
i
may
say
the
future
go,
but
--
about
the
middle
ages,
but
if
you
did
have
a
statute
there,
which
on
it
face
made
it
illegal
or
crime
to
serve
white
and
colored
people
together
in
some
kinds
of
restaurants,
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
--
an
unfair
about
following
or
(inaudible)
to
say
that
that
was
enough
to
come
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
lawyer
could
read
it
of
course
and
to
say
that
it
doesn't
cover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
this
statute
such
that
we
should
not
pass
in
that
same
kind
of
responsibility
on
the
state
under
writ.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
contract
was
violated
in
the
shelley
v.
kraemer?
and
when
was
the
contract
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
--
what
has
happened
in
the
meantime,
during
the
four
years
period?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
anything
in
those
new
deeds
over
the
years
that
--
that
contained
this
covenant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
had
there
whether
it's
significant
or
not?
while
it's
an
old
contract
made
many
years
before
(inaudible),
it
did
and
i
assume
you
did
at
that
time,
it
could
(inaudible),
what
should
be
done
in
40
years
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
determining
what
could
be
done
to
a
land
with
somebody
else's
home.
it
may
not
be
significant,
but
it's
tied
into
a
pretty
significant
part
of
this
country's
history
in
regards
to
the
ownership
of
land.
