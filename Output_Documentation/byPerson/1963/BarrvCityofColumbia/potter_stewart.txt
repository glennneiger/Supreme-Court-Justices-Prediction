justice

stewart
that's
a
lot
--
does
that
mean
the
state
police?
that's
a
long
way,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
at
this
point,
assuming
–
assuming,
putting
aside
your
--
your
constitutional
argument,
at
this
point
an
offense
had
been
committed,
had
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
putting
aside
the
--
the
vagueness
arguments
and
your
constitutional
argument,
but
at
this
point,
it
was
appropriate
that
--
it's
what
i'm
suggesting
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
take
--
takeover
because
an
offense
had
been
committed
under
the
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
except
stay
there
after
they've
been
told
to
leave.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
say,
i
--
i'm
putting
to
one
side,
the
constitutional
argument
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
an
offense
had
been
then
committed
after
they've
stayed
there,
after
been
--
being
told
to
leave,
had
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
the
convictions
under
both
statues
were
affirmed
(inaudible)
both
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
and
breach
of
peace?
justice
potter
stewart
disorderly
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
disorderly
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
it,
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
these
petitioners
were
convicted
under
both.
justice
potter
stewart
and
convictions
under
both
were
affirmed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
were
concurrent
or
consecutive
sentences
imposed
or
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
played
so
the
rule
(inaudible)
the
redcoats
are
coming
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
--
that's
all
the
record
shows
just
--
just
that
negroes
are
coming.
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
that.
i'm
sorry.
justice
potter
stewart
stokes
was
this
so-called
sled
man?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
say
anything,
did
say
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
significant
is
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
remembering
my
brother
goldberg's
question
in
the
previous
case,
right,
as
to
whether
or
not
if
the
duty
of
the
police
officer
to
arrest
somebody
simply
because
he's
requested
to
do
so
and
the
answer
is
obviously
no
in
any
state
but
certainly
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
that
--
that
it
is
a
duty
of
the
police
officer
to
arrest
somebody
if
a
misdemeanor
is
committed
in
his
presence
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he's
requested
to
do
so,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
contention
is
there
or
is
there
ms.
motley
that
--
that
that
any
statute
or
ordinance
directly
bore
on
this
situation
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
term
of
the
century
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
--
there
was
no
--
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
there
was
no
statute
or
ordinance,
which
compelled
the
--
this
restaurant
--
this
store
proprietor
to
do
as
he
did
to
discriminate.
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
or
--
and
none
which
made
it
an
offense
for
--
for
people
to
eat
together,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
adding
something
very
similar
to
it
is,
be
--
going
to
be
before
us
in
the
next
case,
bell
against
maryland,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
suggest
that
such
proof
be
adduced?
you're
suggesting
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts
get
pretty
deeply
into
the
realm
of
psychology.
each
of
us
is
motivated
by
a
variety
of
factors
inherited
environmental.
each
of
us
is
motivated
by
customs
of
those
of
whom
he
lives.
these
are
all
fairly,
fairly
settled.
psychological
considerations
calling
upon
a
discipline,
which
does
not
deal
in
its
amplitude,
is
that
the
kind
of
evidence
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
after
all
that
--
after
all
that
evidence
was
in
and
maybe
--
maybe
the
defense
could
get
a
psychologist
on
the
stand
to
say
that
everybody
is
motivated
by
a
desire
to
be
respected
by
its
peer
groups
and
so
on
and
that
the
peer
group
was
a
community
still,
held
this
deeply
and
transitive
even
in
subconscious
opinions,
would
that
be
enough
to
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
what
you're
getting
into,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
–
how
does
your
third
point
differ
from
the
first
one?
justice
potter
stewart
the
matter
--
as
a
matter
of
south
carolina
law,
has
this
statute,
i'
talking
now
about
16-386,
which
begins
by
saying
every
entry
upon
the
lands
of
another
where
any
horse,
mule,
cow,
hog
or
any
other
livestock
is
pastured.
has
that
been
consistently
construed
to
apply
the
--
the
places
like
drug
stores?
justice
potter
stewart
presumably
there
aren't
many
horses
or
cows
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
after
these
convictions?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
position
on
the
merits
if
you
reach
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
preliminary
position
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
this
was
never
raised
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
if
any
state
where
there's
not
segregation
in
penal
institution?
