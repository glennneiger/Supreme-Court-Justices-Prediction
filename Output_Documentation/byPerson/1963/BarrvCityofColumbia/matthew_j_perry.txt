mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
case
arose
in
march,
1960
at
which
time
the
sit-in
movement
or
the
movement
which
brings
these
cases
before
the
court
at
this
time,
was
perhaps
at
its
highest
stage.
one
day
before
this
case
arose,
some
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
went
to
the
office
of
the
city
manager
of
the
city
of
columbia
to
discuss
matters
pertaining
to
the
efforts
of
negroes
to
use
lunch
counter
facilities
in
the
city
of
columbia
and
at
that
conference,
the
record
shows
that
the
city
manager
of
the
city
of
columbia
advised
some
of
these
petitioners,
gentlemen,
further
demonstrations
will
not
be
tolerated.
at
that
particular
time,
the
--
most
of
the
stores,
drugstores
and
other
stores
which
had
lunch
counters
in
the
city
of
columbia
followed
the
policy
of
excluding
negroes
or
of
segregating
them
therein.
a
few
days
before
march
15,
1960,
police
officers
working
for
the
city
of
columbia
and
other
officers
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
working
in
cooperation
with
the
city
police
of
the
city
of
columbia,
learned
that
negroes
would
make
an
effort
to
gain
food
service
at
the
taylor
street
pharmacy
located
in
the
city
of
columbia.
agent
carl
stokes
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
testified
that
he
and
other
officers
advised
the
management
of
taylor
street
pharmacy
that
negroes
were
coming.
they
had
some
meeting
among
themselves
and
worked
out
a
plan
whereby
the
action
which
was
thereafter
taken
was
formulated.
this
plan
was
that
among
other
things,
that
officers
would
be
placed
in
the
premises
of
the
taylor
street
pharmacy.
on
march
15,
1960,
agent
carl
stokes
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
and
the
deputy
sheriff
were
on
duty
in
the
taylor
street
pharmacy
premises.
they've
been
waiting
there
throughout
the
morning,
up
until
the
time
the
five
petitioners
here
appeared.
when
the
petitioners
entered
the
store,
they
walked
in
quietly
and
some
of
them
stopped
near
the
front
of
the
store
to
purchase
some
cards.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
they
might
have
known
it,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
the
--
the
solicitor
general's
argument
on
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
here
might
still
have
merit
because
of
course,
the
statute
did
not
give
these
petitioners
any
warning.
they
--
they
may
have
known
but
the
statute
didn't.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they
were
told
this
officially
by
the
city
manager
of
the
city
of
columbia.
however,
petitioner,
david
carter
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
did
not
know
he
would
not
be
served
and
that
in
fact
he
went
there
to
be
served.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
would
say
that
he
was
expressing
some
optimism,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
after
some
of
the
petitioners
stopped
to
buy
postcards
or
other
cards,
they
then
started
walking
to
the
rear
of
the
store.
now
here,
perhaps
i
should
state
the
lay-out
of
the
store.
the
taylor
street
pharmacy
is
a
very
large
drugstore
in
the
city
of
columbia.
in
fact,
it
is
described
by
its
manager
as
a
department
store.
it
also
has
a
restaurant
which
is
located
near
the
rear
or
at
the
rear
of
the
store
premises.
the
petitioners
started
walking
back
there
and
agent
carl
stokes
together
with
the
deputy
sheriff
followed
them
in
close
pursuit
because
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
agent
stokes
and
the
deputy
sheriff
were
waiting
for
and
as
the
petitioners
went
into
the
restaurant
area,
some
of
them
--
all
of
them
took
seats
at
different
points.
the
manager
of
the
store
came
into
the
lunchroom
area
and
stationed
himself
at
a
point
where
he
felt
his
voice
could
be
heard
by
all
and
stated
that
the
negroes
would
not
be
served
and
that
they
would
have
to
leave.
at
this
time,
agent
stokes
was
standing
right
by
the
manager
there
in
close
proximity
to
him
and
after
the
--
the
store
manager
had
made
his
statement
and
petitioners
did
not
move,
agent
stokes
leaned
over
and
said
to
the
manager,
"now,
you
go
over
and
tell
each
one
of
them
in
person
or
--
or
directly
to
leave
in
my
presence."
acting
in
response
to
the
request
of
the
--
the
police
officer,
mr.
terry,
the
manager
went
over
to
each
of
the
petitioners,
all
except
one
of
them
and
told
them
that
they
would
have
to
leave,
with
that
is
with
agent
stokes
still
following
in
close
pursuit.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
agent
stokes
was
an
officer
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division.
after
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
is
the
official
police
force
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
in
edward
versus
south
carolina.
after
the
manager
had
directed
the
negroes
to
leave,
he
then
left
the
area
of
the
lunch
counter
or
the
restaurant.
one
of
the
petitioners
sought
to
have
some
words
with
him
on
the
way
out
but
the
manager
said,
"i
have
nothing
further
to
say"
and
kept
leaving
the
place.
at
this
point
then,
agent
stokes
and
the
deputy
sheriff
took
over
completely
with
petitioners
still
occupying
their
seats
in
the
same
manner
which
had
characterized
their
conduct
before
the
manager
left.
and
at
that
--
at
this
point,
mr.
stokes,
the
--
the
sled
agent
stated
to
the
petitioners,
"now,
i
am
a
state
officer
and
i
am
saying
to
you,
you
will
have
to
leave."
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
in
our
view,
the
--
no
offense
at
that
time
had
been
committed
because
the
petitioners
had
done
nothing
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
and
the
only
reason
for
the
request
which
was
made
to
them
to
leave
was
because
they're
negroes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
an
offense
which
has
been
--
has
been
defined
by
south
carolina
to
constitute
an
offense.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
we
did,
however,
contend
that
the
petitioners
were
--
were
pursuing
their
constitutional
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
expression.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
was
not
specifically
raised
that
the
--
at
the
trial
except
to
the
extent
that
it
might
have
been
raised
in
the
--
the
contention
that
petitioners
were
exercising
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
not
specifically.
when
--
when
agent
stokes
said
to
the
petitioners,
"alright,
now,
i'm
a
police
officer
and
you
will
have
to
leave,"
petitioners
kept
their
seats.
he
there
upon
placed
them
under
arrest
and
told
them
to
follow
me
at
which
time
all
of
the
petitioners
followed
agent
stokes
out
of
the
store
and
got
into
his
police
car.
now,
these
petitioners
were
thereupon
charged
in
warrants
issued
by
the
city
of
columbia
with
trespass
under
section
16-386
of
the
south
carolina
code
of
laws
for
1952
at
that
time,
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
since
that
time,
south
carolina
has
re-codified
under
that
1962
code
and
the
19
-â€“
the
section
to
which
we
refer
as
section
16-386
under
the
1952
code
is
now
codified
by
the
same
numerical
number
in
the
1962
code.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
is
no
change
made.
it's
copied
verbatim.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
however,
shortly
after
these
cases
reached
the
court
in
march
1960,
south
carolina
enacted
a
new
statute
which
was
before
this
court
last
year
in
peterson
versus
city
of
greenville,
now
codified
as
section
16-388.
petitioners
were
also
charged
with
breach
of
peace
under
a
statute
which
is
set-off
in
the
record
of
these
proceedings
as
section
16-509.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it's
set
forth
in
petitioners'
brief
at
page
3.
i
beg
you
pardon.
i
have
misstated
the
numerical
section,
section
15-909.
this
is
the
first
time
that
particular
statute
had
been
invoked.
the
court
will
recall
that
we
were
here
in
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
at
which
time
the
court
convicted
petitioners
of
the
common
law
offense
of
breach
of
peace,
but
throughout
these
proceedings,
the
--
the
convictions
of
petitioners
here
have
been
referred
to
as
violations
of
the
particular
section
to
which
we
refer.
petitioners
were
tried
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
columbia
known
as
the
recorder's
court
and
were
found
guilty
of
the
crimes
of
trespass
and
the
breach
of
peace.
the
richland
county
court
affirmed
as
did
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
later
rejecting
petitioners'
claims
that
their
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
and
rejecting
further
petitioners'
claim
that
the
evidence
presented
against
them
did
not
support
the
charge
made
on
the
ground
that
the
exceptions
which
petitioners
made
were
said
to
have
been
too
general.
however,
this
was
the
first
time
in
these
series
of
cases
that
the
court
had
invoked
such
a
rule
and
in
fact
in
other
cases
decided
about
the
same
time
ruled
upon
exceptions,
identical
to
those
which
were
framed
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
breach
of
peace.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
the
statue
is
entitled
disorderly
conduct
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
but
it
includes
a
multitude
of
offenses
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
including
breach
of
peace.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
were
affirmed,
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
consecutive
sentences
were
---
were
imposed
in
these
cases
with
$24.50
of
each
sentence
being
suspended.
we
do
not
know
what
brought
about
the
particular
formula
the
court
used
except
that
it
represented
some
arbitrary
concept
on
the
part
of
the
court.
this
case
then
involves,
we
think
a
very
clear
cut
illustration
of
the
use
of
state
power
to
enforce
racial
segregation.
the
police
in
this
case
came
into
the
matter
before
petitioners
ever
went
upon
the
premises
of
taylor
street
pharmacy.
they
warned
the
manager
in
fact
that
negroes
were
coming.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
and
they
also
counseled
to
the
manager
in
the
method
in
which
the
criminal
offense
was
to
be
charged
and
the
evidence
secured
in
order
--
in
order
to
later
go
to
court
and
prosecute
because
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
alright
sir.
agent
carl
stokes
testified
that
he
stood
next
to
the
manager
and
after
the
manger
told
the
petitioners,
"i
--
i
will
not
serve
you,
you
will
have
to
leave,"
the
agent
carrying
the
full
colloquy
of
south
carolina
power
stood
next
to
the
manager
and
said
to
him,
"now,
you
go
and
tell
each
one
of
these
petitioners,
each
one
of
these
--
these
persons,
he
will
have
to
leave
in
my
presence."
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
and
the
deputy
sheriff
also
was
on
the
premises
and
standing
close
by.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
deputy
sheriff
said
anything.
i
believe
that
--
that
respect
and
deference
was
given
to
the
agent
from
the
official
police
force
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
i
think
agent
stokes
outranked
the
deputy
sheriff
and
the
record
indicates
that
he
did
most
of
the
active
cooperation
with
the
management
in
this
case.
the
record
also
showed
that
he
counseled
with
him
before
the
negroes
came,
while
the
negroes
were
upon
premises
and
then
in
fact
arrested
the
petitioners
without
having
been
requested
to
do
so
by
the
manager.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
i
think
that
it
is
significant
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
to
this
court,
the
extent
to
which
the
--
the
power
of
the
state
was
--
was
used
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
the
thing
what
happened
here
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
that
may
be
true
sir.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
where,
as
here,
the
--
the
state
had
no
statute
specifically
prohibiting
this
conduct,
the
city
of
columbia
had
no
ordinance
specifically
prohibiting
it
as
well
as
the
case
in
peterson
versus
greenville,
the
state
officer
requested
and
demanded
that
petitioners
leave.
there
--
he
thereby,
made
up
a
crime
for
them
to
they
have
to
remain
and
when
they
refuse
to
immediately
leave,
the
power
of
the
state
further
went
into
operation
by
carrying
forth
an
arrest
which
was
not
requested
by
the
manager
and
we
submit
that
this
is
important
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
the
extent
of
the
--
the
full
power
abused
by
the
police.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
precisely.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
precisely
our
opposition
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
state
court
recognized
the
right
on
the
part
of
management
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
to
exclude
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
negroes
and
thereby
declared
a
state
law
of
policy
which
we
feel
violates
petitioners'
rights
to
both
equal
protection
and
due
process.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes
sir,
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
i
think
that
when
we
examine
that
against
the
--
the
background
of
statutes
in
south
carolina
which
specifically
require
racial
segregation
and
the
custom
which
these
statutes
seemed
to
have
generated.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well
sir,
i
think
that
that
it's
in
the
record
right
from
the
beginning
of
the
first
warning
that
agent
stokes
and
other
officers
conveyed
to
the
manager
that
negroes
were
coming.
i
think
it's
also
apparent
in
the
record
when
agent
stokes
and
the
deputy
sheriff
went
on
duty
on
the
store
premises.
i
think
it
is
also
apparent
that
when
petitioners
were
entering
the
restaurant,
agent
stokes
and
the
deputy
sheriff
followed
them
in
close
pursuit,
this
being
their
primary
purpose
on
the
premises.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
if
you
will
go
back
to
the
first
one
or
the
two
statements
are
made
which
appears
in
the
testimony
of
petitioner,
david
carter.
prior
to
the
entry
and
to
the
taylor
street
drugstore
premises,
these
young
men
had
been
and
to
see
the
city
manager
and
he
had
said
to
them,
"gentlemen,
further
demonstrations
will
not
be
tolerated."
i
believe
we
have
to
begin
there
to
see
exactly
where
the
--
the
statement
on
the
part
of
the
police
of
the
city
of
columbia
came
from
and
where
the
full
power
of
the
government
of
south
carolina
came
from.
