where
do
you
find
that
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
this
record
shows
that
the
state
was
there
not
to
enforce
property
rights
but
to
enforce
segregation.
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
you're
really
saying?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
implicit
at
least
in
these
--
these
records
and
these
cases
come
up
in
various
skimpy
ways,
implicit
in
this
â€“
wouldn't
you
think
it
was
fair
to
say
that
the
state
court
at
least,
rightly
or
wrongly
found
to
the
contrary.
in
other
words,
it
recognized
that
the
state
could
not
do
what
you're
claiming,
it
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
exclude.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or,
little
off
at
least
i
was
trying
to
say,
you're
--
you're
making
a
specific
statement
that
because
of
the
advance
notice
of
this,
of
the
police
of
stokes
who
was
--
the
stokes
that
negroes
are
coming
to
the
restaurant
and
his
action
on
the
premises
in
arresting
without
--
without
requesting
the
owner
and
other
things
you've
said
all
add
up
to
something
that
indicates
that
state
was
really
enforcing
segregation
here
rather
than
enforcing
the
trespass
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
you're
getting
off
again
and
my
brother
said
because
i'm
--
i'm
dealing
with
a
particular
thing
because
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
if
you
can
demonstrate
what
you
show,
you're
entitled
to
a
(inaudible)
of
this
case
because
i
can't
see
in
the
record
yet,
that's
what
i'm
--
