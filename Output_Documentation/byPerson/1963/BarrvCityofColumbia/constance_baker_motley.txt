ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
this
court
for
review
upon
the
granting
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
affirming
the
convictions
of
petitioners
for
trespass.
that
law,
section
16-386,
by
its
terms
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
upon
the
lands
of
another
after
notice
from
the
owner
or
tenant
prohibiting
such
entry.
the
negro
petitioners
in
this
case
are
columbia,
south
carolina
college
students,
who
were
arrested
on
march
16th,
1960
when
they
went
into
eckerds
drug
store,
a
large
multi-department
chain
store,
the
only
department
of
which
--
which
is
restricted
to
whites
is
the
lunch
counter.
the
petitioner
seated
themselves
in
a
booth
in
the
lunch
counter
and
the
owner
asked
them
to
leave
and
the
police
officer
asked
them
to
leave
and
after
a
few
minutes
hesitation,
one
got
up,
the
other
was
attempting
to
get
up
and
he
was
pulled
up
by
the
police
officer,
and
they
were
arrested.
petitioners
were
tried
in
the
recorder's
court
in
the
city
of
columbia
without
a
jury
on
march
25th,
1960.
they
were
convicted
of
trespass
and
sentenced
to
pay
a
fine
of
$100,
$24.50
of
which
was
suspended
or
30
days
in
jail.
their
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
richmond
county
court
criminal
division
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
throughout
the
state
court
proceedings,
petitioners
claimed
that
their
arrest
and
convictions
violated
rights
secured
to
them
by
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
petitioners
urged
that
their
convictions
amounted
to
state
enforcement
of
private
racial
segregation
to
the
use
of
the
state's
judicial
machinery
to
enforce
such
discrimination
in
a
public
place
where
--
where
petitioners
have
been
invited
to
trade
and
where
they
had
the
right
to
be
and
that
this
action
singled
them
out
for
different
treatment
by
the
state
solely
because
of
their
race
and
color.
these
contentions
were
summarily
overruled
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
on
the
ground
that
similar
contentions
have
been
rejected
by
it
in
a
similar
case,
city
of
greenville
against
peterson,
which
was
reversed
here
last
term
on
other
ground.
upon
this
review,
petitioners
contend
first
that
their
rights
have
been
violated
because
here,
the
state's
criminal
law
enforcement
and
judicial
machinery
were
employed
to
sanction
and
enforce
private
racial
discrimination
in
a
place
open
to
the
public.
every
member
of
the
public
could
go
into
this
place
and
every
white
member
of
the
public
could
sit
at
the
lunch
counter.
secondly,
petitioners
claim
that
their
rights
have
been
violated
because
the
state
is
involved
in
this
act
of
racial
discrimination,
because
it's
an
act
performed
by
the
manager
of
eckerds
drug
store
in
obedience
to
a
community
wide
custom
of
racial
segregation
in
public-eating
places,
which
custom
in
turn
is
dictated
in
part
by
a
state
law
and
massively
supported
and
encouraged
by
a
network
of
corresponding
state
laws
clearly
defining
that
state's
long
pursued
policy
of
enforcing
racial
segregation.
not
only
in
the
public
life
of
the
state,
but
in
private
affairs
as
well.
thirdly,
petitioners
claim
that
their
rights
have
been
violated
because,
contrary
to
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
no
state
shall
deny
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
south
carolina
has
denied
the
same
by
a
regime
of
laws,
which
fails
to
furnish
such
protection
to
petitioners
by
subordinating
petitioner's
claim
to
equality
in
the
public
facilities
of
the
community
to
a
narrow
and
technical
property
claim,
which
is
no
more
than
an
assertion
of
their
right
to
deny
equal
treatment
to
negroes
in
one
department
of
a
store
open
to
any
member
of
the
white
public.
now,
the
gravamen
of
this
case
was
put
before
the
arresting
officer
in
a
single
question,
which
appears
on
page
17
of
the
record.
the
arresting
officer
was
the
assistant
chief
of
police
and
he
was
asked
this,
"chief,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
only
reason
you
are
called
in
from
the
police
department
to
arrest
these
two
persons
was
because
they
were
negroes
who
are
asking
for
service
in
the
food
department
of
eckerds
store.
and
the
manager
was
directing
them
out
because
they
were
negroes,
isn't
that
correct?"
and
the
chief
answered,
"why,
certainly,"
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
case.
consequently,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
the
policy
of
eckerds
drug
store
was
to
permit
negroes
to
trade
in
all
of
the
numerous
departments
of
the
store
except
the
lunch
counter.
at
one
point,
the
manager
of
the
drug
store
testified
that
he
did
not
refuse
to
serve
petitioners
because
they
were
negroes,
that's
on
page
26,
but
when
he
realized
that
he's
previously
admitted,
an
obvious
policy
would
not
permit
him
on
the
cross
examination
to
evade
the
crucial
issue
as
to
why
service
was
denied,
he
asserted
all
stores
do
the
same
thing.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
manager's
refusal
to
serve
therefore
was
influenced
by
community
custom,
which
we
claim
amounts
to
unconstitutional
state
action
because
dictated
in
part
by
state
law
and
supported
by
a
massive
state
segregation
policy.
constitutionally
relevant
here,
is
the
fact
that
this
community-wide
custom
of
not
serving
negro
and
white
persons
together
in
public-eating
places
in
south
carolina
is
expressly
dictated
in
part
by
a
state
law.
at
the
turn
of
the
century
when
public-eating
places
were
largely
the
concern
of
people
traveling,
south
carolina
made
it
a
crime
to
furnish
meals
to
white
and
colored
persons
in
the
same
room,
at
the
same
table
or
at
the
same
counter
in
station
restaurants
or
station
eating
houses,
in
times
limited
by
common
carriers
of
such
passengers.
and
then,
in
peterson
versus
city
of
louisville,
the
case
which
was
here
the
last
term,
there
was
a
south
carolina
city
ordinance
in
greenville,
which
expressly
required
segregation
in
restaurants.
in
addition
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
not
this
statute
which
i
just
referred
to
--
referred
to
station
restaurants
and
railroad
stations.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it
did
not
say
a
lunch
counter
in
a
drug
store.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
well,
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
state
policy
and
this,
the
custom
stemmed
or
was
generated
by
this
state
policy
expressed
in
this
statute
and
numerous
other
state
statutes
making
the
action
of
the
owner
state
action
because
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
no
infused
with
the
state
policy.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
there
was
no
ordinance
or
a
state
statute.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
that's
right
and
then
as
i've
said,
this
custom
which
was
dictated
in
part
by
state
law
and
that
it
expressed
the
state's
policy
with
respect
to
public
eating
in
a
certain
area
was
again
massively
supported
and
has
been
for
almost
a
century
by
south
carolina
statutes,
which
created
the
segregated
society
presently
existing
in
that
state
because
the
state
not
only
decreed
segregation
in
the
public
life,
and
facilities
owned
and
operated
by
the
state
but
in
a
facilities
owned
and
operated
by
private
individuals
as
well.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
during
reconstruction,
there
is
historical
evidence
that
negroes
were
able
to
eat
in
public-eating
places
in
columbia,
south
carolina,
the
same
city
involved
here
and
as
way
as
1895
and
1898,
there
was
opposition
in
south
carolina
to
the
enactment
of
racist
legislation.
however,
it
is
obvious
that
the
pro-segregation
forces
prevailed
and
after
a
brief,
desegregated
reconstruction
era,
the
policy
of
south
carolina
changed
and
became
that
of
segregation
of
the
races
as
we've
said
as
evidenced
by
these
numerous
laws,
which
requires
segregation
in
such
places,
in
circuses,
in
traveling
shows,
steamed
ferries,
carrier
stations,
restaurants,
textile
factory.
in
other
words,
the
state
extended
its
policy
beyond
the
public
life
into
private
affairs.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
--
that's
right.
also
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
didn't
get
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
yes.
all
of
these
that
we've
collected
on
page
28
of
our
brief
i
think
footnote
--
it's
page
30
footnote
11.
we've
collected
all
of
the
current
laws
in
south
carolina
bearing
on
segregation.
those
require
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
we
filed
a
joint
brief
in
9,
10
and
12.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it
applies
in
--
yes,
in
9
and
10,
and
12.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
we
have
argued
that
in
our
brief
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
the
vagueness
was
not
raised
as
such
in
the
south
carolina
court.
however,
throughout
the
proceeding,
due
process
was
raised
and
when
the
case
got
to
the
supreme
court
and
a
petition
where
--
for
rehearing
was
expressly
pointed
out
that
free
speech
was
involved
and
one
of
these
petitioners
bouie
had
been
convicted
of
resisting
arrest
and
one
of
the
assignments
of
error
or
two
of
the
assignments
of
error
were
failure
of
the
state
to
prove
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
failure
of
the
state
to
prove
the
corpus
delicti
which
i
understand
in
south
carolina,
means
the
state
proved
no
crime
and
that
was
raised
and
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
they
reversed
bouie's
conviction
for
resisting
arrest
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that.
so
they
did
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
so,
if
here
we're
saying
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
convict
the
petitioners
of
the
crime
defined
by
the
statute.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
now,
also
relevant
here
is
i've
just
mentioned
is
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
perceptible
voluntary
change
in
the
state's
policy.
the
south
carolina
announced
for
example,
just
in
august
that
it
would
close
its
state
parks
rather
than
desegregate
them
as
required
by
a
federal
court.
in
other
words,
south
carolina
is
still
pursuing
and
pushing
a
public
policy
of
segregation
and
this
public
policy
permeates
every
aspect
of
life
in
south
carolina
either
by
direct
legislative
file
as
we've
pointed
out
or
by
public
custom
of
the
nature
described
here.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
after
this
case,
negroes
were
able
to
eat
in
this
particular
drug
store.
some
negroes
have
been
admitted
to
the
state
colleges,
clemson
college
by
a
court
order,
however,
the
university
of
south
carolina
by
court
order
and
negro
students
were
admitted
to
elementary
schools
in
charleston,
south
carolina
in
september
pursuant
to
court
order.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
state's
previous
policy
would
still
be
there
but
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
the
state
would
have
to
certainly
at
least
provide
a
remedy
against
such
discrimination
and
the
state
in
every
case,
thereafter,
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
was
no
state
power
still
infecting
the
private
action
here
and
if
the
state
could
prove
that,
then
the
state
exonerates
itself.
but
i
think
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
to
do
that
before
they
could
start
claiming
that
they
were
no
longer
involved
here
and
--
because
otherwise,
we
claim
that
in
everyone
of
these
cases,
they
would
have
a
heavy
burden
of
proving
that
this
man
acted
without
any
relation
prior
to
state's
policy
in
discriminating
against
a
negro
who
went
into
the
drug
store.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
you
see
the
northern
states
of
all
past
statutes
giving
us
a
remedy
against
such
discrimination,
and
certainly,
in
that
situation,
you
go
in
the
state
court
enforce
that
state
law
so
the
state
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
we
will
cite
30
statutes,
state
statutes
provi
--
prohibiting
discrimination
and
public
accommodations.
now,
they
don't
cover
every
single
public
accommodation
but
there,
the
state
would
not
have
the
same
heavy
burden
that
south
carolina
has
of
showing
that
the
state's
policy
is
not
operating
here.
and
we
say
that
in
all
these
cases,
a
state
could
not
be
heard
to
say
that
its
massive
policy
of
segregation
had
no
effect,
whatsoever
and
that
it
never
intended
to
enforce
segregation
in
this
kind
of
situation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
if
in
south
carolina,
the
moral
they
should
repeal
all
state
laws
on
segregation
and
the
owners
just
reminisce
against
us
the
next
day.
we
say
the
state
still
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
his
action
was
without
any
reference
whatsoever
to
the
state's
previous
policy
or
this
custom
which
we
claim
as
was
generated
and
supported
by
state
law.
and
we
think
that
the
day
after
the
state
passed
--
repeals
all
its
laws
and
south
carolina
would
certainly
be
too
soon
for
us
to
say
there
is
no
state
involvement
at
all
here
because
the
magic
of
repealing
those
statutes
has
wiped
out
all
of
the
influence
which
the
state
policy
previously
had.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
no.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
what
were
--
would
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
no.
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
no.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
yes.
in
maryland,
the
state
has
passed
a
statute.
the
bell,
we
say,
it's
again,
too
soon
for
the
state
to
say
it
was
--
its
policy
did
not
influenced
the
owner
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
owner
said,
"that's
the
only
reason
i'm
segregating.
i
would
love
to
have
you,"
but
the
custom
is
what's
operating
here
and
in
maryland,
they've
had
a
similar
massive
segregation
policy.
it's
only
recently
that
they
began
to
change
that
policy
and
we
say
--
in
that
case
the
burden
is
still
on
the
state
to
show
that
that
policy
has
not
influenced
the
choice
of
the
owner
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
case,
the
owner
said,
"it
does.
it's
the
only
thing
that
influences
my
choice."
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
the
state
would
have
to
begin
with
its
laws
to
--
to
point
out
that
these
segregation
laws,
anything
having
to
do
with
this
particular
facility,
and
then
repeal
by
the
state
are
not
enforced
by
the
state
and
the
state
has
gone
further
and
provided
a
remedy
against
such
discrimination.
and
all
of
these
kinds
of
things
i
think
the
state
would
have
to
prove
and
of
course,
the
state
will
then
have
to
show
that
this
was
--
has
been
many
years
of
the
state
had
any
such
laws,
that
it
couldn't
possibly
have
had
the
effect
which
we
claim.
we
only
ask
that
the
state
be
charged
with
the
normal
and
probable
consequences
of
its
act
as
anyone
else
is.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
no.
i
don't
think
just
a
psychologist
coming
in
and
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
there
is
so
much
evidence
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
state's
policy
that
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden
right
now
in
this
case
with
all
of
these
laws
which
required
segregation
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
get
involved
in
that
kind
of
situation
in
south
carolina
where
we
would
have
difficulty
in
proving
or
the
state
would
have
difficulty
in
proving
no
state
involvement
and
no
effect
to
the
state's
policy
in
this
kind
of
situation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
certainly.
slaves
didn't
have
the
right
to
go
in
anything.
the
slaves
didn't
have
any
rights,
which
the
white
men
or
the
state
was
bound
to
respect
and
then
during
reconstruction
as
i've
pointed
out
briefly
in
south
carolina,
they
did
have
some
rights
and
then
segregation
was
established
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
state
policy,
and
everything
became
segregated.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
that's
the
codification
thing.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
yes.
these
are
old
statutes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
they
were
all
re-codified
in
1962
code
as
far
as
i'm
--
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
just
the
one
that
i
referred
to,
and
that's
in
the
1962
code
which
prohibits
serving
negroes
and
whites
in
a
--
in
a
station
restaurant,
that's
still
in
the
code.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
sir.
in
1906
i
believe,
we
checked
that
and
the
--
you
know,
it
gives
the
history
of
the
legislation
in
the
code
under
the
statute
and
it
indicates
that
it
was
first
enacted
in
1906,
that
particular
statute.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
it
wasn't.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
right
after
the
suit
and
--
in
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
suppose
since
the
drug
store
was
open,
i'm
not
certain
to
that.
i
think
that
in
all
of
these
situations,
the
negroes
have
always
been
permitted
to
buy
at
all
of
the
counters
except
the
eating
counter.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
happened
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
that
the
facilities
in
these
department
stores
are
segregated
like
the
rest
rooms
and
if
they
have
a
lunch
counter,
it
was
some
time
segregated
or
negroes
excluded
all
together,
but
they
could
buy
at
the
merchandise
counters
generally
without
discrimination.
they
might
have
had
to
wait
until
all
the
white
customers
were
waited
on,
something
like
that,
but
the
policy
in
these
department
stores
and
drug
stores
is
to
segregate
only
the
eating.
this,
again,
was
a
part
of
the
custom
not
to
eat
with
negroes
and
as
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
the
owner
said,
"all
stores
do
the
same
thing."
when
we
asked
him
--
oh,
when
he
was
asked,
"did
you
refuse
to
serve
these
petitioners
because
they
were
negroes?"
he
first
said
no,
and
then
he
said,
"well,
all
everybody
does
the
same
thing,"
which
to
me
says,
this
is
a
custom
that
what
i'm
doing
is
what
everybody
does.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
and
of
course
the
other
evidence
is
what
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
and
that's
all
of
these
statutes
of
south
carolina.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
can
ask
the
state,
maybe
they
know
of
other
stores
that
have
been
desegregated.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
they
have
been.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
lunch
counters.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
sir.
they
limited
the
lunch
counter,
as
he
says
not
restaurants
per
se.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
