justice
william
j.
brennan,

we
ran
into
that
i
think
in
edward
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not
raised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
it
argued
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mrs.
motley,
your
argument
in
essence
is
that
just
as
the
store
owner
in
peterson
would
not
be
heard
to
say
that
he
made
a
private
choice,
invited
the
existence
of
an
ordinance
expressly
requiring
segregated
eating
facility?
here,
the
store
owner
ought
not
be
heard
to
say
he
made
a
private
choice
against
the
background
(inaudible)
to
segregation
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
this
argument
apply
in
9
and
12
as
well
as
in
10?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
may
not
be
the
appropriate
place
to
ask
it,
while
i
think
of
it
mrs.
motley,
are
you
also
arguing
the
point
that
this
south
carolina
trespass
statute
does
not
give
fair
warning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
raise
it
in
the
--
i
think
vagueness
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
that
would
embrace
the
fair
warning
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
go
beyond
that
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
me
mrs.
motley.
your
--
your
answer
is
that
no
one
will
be
heard
to
say
that
the
choice
was
a
private
choice
as
long
as
there
exists
in
this
kind
of
massive
body
of
legislation
requirement
segregation,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
--
state
will
be
heard
to
say
but
rather
the
private
individual
will
not
be
heard
to
say
that
when
he
asked
negroes
to
leave,
this
was
a
private
choice
that
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
first
enacted
in
1962,
mrs.
motley?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
motley,
of
this
desegregation
of
eckerds,
is
that
the
only
one
that
has
been
desegregated
at
the
lunch
counters
there
?i
think
you've
told
us
that
presently
that
lunch
counters
desegregated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
generally
in
columbia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
your
--
on
your
first
point,
will
that
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
examine
the
briefs
before
your
supreme
court
as
we
had
to
do
in
wright
versus
georgia,
to
decide
whether
in
fact
the
question
had
been
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
have
to
do
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that
decided?
