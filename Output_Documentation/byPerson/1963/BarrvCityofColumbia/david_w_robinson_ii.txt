mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
an
agreement
with
counsel
that
petitioners
will
argue
in
number
10
and
then
we
will
reply
in
both
9
and
10
if
that
meets
with
the
court's
approval.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
replying
in
behalf
of
the
city
of
columbia
in
both
numbers
9
and
10
and
would
request
that
you
consider
all
of
my
remarks
addressed
to
both
cases
except
when
i
specify
otherwise.
i
would
first
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
problems
of
vagueness
and
the
convictions
on
the
merits
in
these
cases.
it's
our
position
that
these
cases
are
not
defective
for
those
reasons,
for
three
reasons.
first
that
petitioners
failed
to
properly
raise
and
present
the
question
of
whether
they
were
guilty
of
trespass
at
all
before
the
state
supreme
court.
secondly,
that
they
had
actual
notice
of
the
owner's
policy
before
they
enter
these
stores,
therefore,
were
guilty
under
the
statutes
and
thirdly,
that
the
question
of
whether
a
construction
of
refusal
to
leave
after
entry,
whether
that
such
a
construction
would
be
vague
was
never
presented
at
all
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
my
first
point
is
that
--
is
that
they
didn't
properly
brief
and
argued
whether
they
were
guilty
of
anything.
the
--
the
third
point
is
that
they
didn't
raise
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
construction
that
was
rendered
by
the
state
court.
in
connection
with
the
first
point,
our
state
supreme
court
has
rules
that
most
appellate
courts
have
regarding
the
exceptions
and
questions
presented
which
are
designed
to
focus
for
the
court
what
the
question
involved
each.
the
questions
and
the
exceptions
in
these
cases
simply
said
that
the
state
failed
to
prove
of
a
prima
facie
case
and
to
produce
a
corpus
delicti.
there
was
no
spelling
out
what
the
error
of
the
trial
court
was.
in
their
briefs,
which
we
have
attached
as
an
--
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
in
the
barr
case,
the
petitioners
have
fully
argued
the
question
of
state
action,
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
a
conviction
on
the
merits,
they
simply
said
that
the
argument
on
the
question
one,
which
was
a
state
action
argument,
would
simply
take
care
of
question
two,
which
was
the
question
whether
they're
guilty
of
anything
and
our
supreme
court
refused
to
raise
the
question.
they
said
that
under
our
rules,
they
have
improperly
raised
it
and
wouldn't
consider.
now,
in
the
bouie
case
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there
are
no
cases
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there
were
no
cases
involving
drug
stores
until
the
charleston
versus
mitchell
decision,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
a
few
days
before
these
cases
were
decided.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
after
these
convictions,
that's
correct.
now,
there
is
language
in
an
old
1926
decision,
which
indicates
that
a
refusal
to
leave
after
notice
would
be
a
misdemeanor,
but
that's
purely
dictum.
that
case
didn't
involve
a
drugstore.
it
didn't
involve
a
refusal
to
anything.
it
was
simply
a
comment
by
the
court
in
refusal
to
leave.
it
was
simply
a
court
comment
that
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
there
are
no
other
decisions
on
it
and
of
course,
we
--.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
had
been
applied
mostly
in
rural
area
--
in
rural
type
cases,
involving
farmland.
quite
often,
you
get
the
question
of
where
there's
been
a
shooting
on
--
with
question
of
retrieve
as
to
whether
the
trespasser
had
a
duty
to
get
off
the
premises
when
requested
to
do
so.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
in
the
bouie
case,
coming
back
to
our
point
number
one,
the
petitioners
did
brief
fully
the
question
of
whether
or
not
bouie
was
guilty
of
resisting
arrest,
and
our
supreme
court
reversed
on
that,
but
when
it
came
to
this
matter
of
where
he
was
guilty
--
guilty
of
trespass
again,
they
simply
passed
it
over,
and
we
submit
that
the
question
was
not
properly
presented
to
our
court.
now,
if
you
conclude
that
it
was,
then
it's
our
position
that
these
people
had
actual
notice
before
they
entered
these
premises.
our
statute
says
in
part
every
entry
after
notice
from
the
owner
prohibiting
such
entry
shall
be
a
misdemeanor.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
petitioners
testified
they
had
been
in
these
stores
many
times
previously
trading
in
the
other
departments.
one
petitioner
testified
that
he
had
bought
food
at
the
lunch
counter
to
take
out.
also,
these
petitioners
testified
specifically
that
their
purpose,
their
sole
purpose
in
entering
these
stores
was
to
be
served
food
or
not
to
buy
food
to
take
out
or
not
to
use
the
other
departments,
and
the
record
as
a
whole
show
that
their
entry
into
these
stores
was
a
demonstration
to
protest
the
owner's
policy
of
refusing
to
serve
negroes.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
trespass
after
notice.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
requiring
a
notice
is
to
let
him
know
that
he
is
not
warned.
if
he
already
knows
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well
but
it--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
it's
--
it's
our
position
that
by
the
owners
maintaining
of
this
policy,
and
by
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
knew
of
it,
this
notice
had
been
brought
home
to
them
before
they
entered
the
premises.
now,
he
had
(inaudible)
that
he
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
that's
our
position.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
what
our
argument
is
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
point,
that's
correct,
sir.
we
feel
it
by
his
holding
store
out
in
this
manner
for
sufficient
length
of
time
and
these
people
admittedly
know
it,
too
and
have
testified.
they
expected
to
be
arrested,
that
they
had
no
--
because
that's
our
position.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
right.
now,
if
you
conclude
that
it
was
raised
and
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
wrong,
then
you
reach
this
constitutional
question
of
vagueness
as
to
whether
this
is
a
refusal
to
leave
after
which
you
must
find
to
be
proper
entry
is
--
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
felt
you
should
examine.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
we
think
so
and
we
have
printed
them
as
appendix
in
our
brief
so
that
you
can
do
so?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
they
have
the
power.
no
question
about
that.
this
a
supreme
court
rule
which
they
99%
of
time
enforce,
but
as
happened
in
the
bouie
case,
they
have
the
power
to
look
into
it,
because
in
bouie,
on
the
same
exceptions,
they
did
reverse
the
conviction
for
resisting
arrest
and
the
exceptions
were
just
as
vague,
but
it
was
argued
in
the
brief
and
the
court
had
it
before
them.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
if
--
if
you're
going
to
find
error
on
the
--
it's
the
part
of
the
state
court,
we
feel
this
should
be
taken
in
consideration
in
your
decision
as
to
whether
to
review
it.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
vagueness,
this
was
raised
at
all
in
the
briefs,
in
the
exceptions,
in
the
questions,
and
in
particular,
we
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
petitions
for
rehearings
in
our
state
court.
we
have
a
typical
procedure,
whereby
after
the
supreme
court's
decision,
counsel
can
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
these
were
filed
in
this
case.
the
rule,
if
i
may
read
to
you
in
part
says,
"the
petition
must
be
filed
stating
particular
the
point
supposed
to
have
been
overlooked
or
misapprehended
by
the
court."
now
these
petitions
were
--
for
rehearing,
were
not
only
filed
of
course
after
the
decisions
in
these
cases.
they
were
also
filed
after
the
decision
in
the
charleston
against
mitchell,
which
i
believe
is
pending
before
you
now,
in
which
our
court
did
so
construe
the
statute
to
make
it
a
trespass,
to
refuse
to
leave.
so
the
precise
--
and
counsel
were
the
same
in
all
cases.
so
counsel
had
notice
of
this
case
and
a
petition
--
the
--
the
points
raised
in
the
petitions
for
rehearing
which
are
contained
in
the
record
make
absolutely
no
reference
to
this
question
of
vagueness.
and
it's
our
position
that
this
court
under
your
decisions
is
without
jurisdiction
to
reverse
for
--
on
a
ground,
which
whereas
was
not
raised
at
all,
it
would
be
highly
improper
to
do
so.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i'm
afraid
i
lost
--
i
lost
your
honor's
question.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
which
i
--
well,
that
case
is
one
of
the
cases
--
it
waived
it
as
to
the
question
of
resisting
arrest,
but
this
was
--
this
question
maybe
i
--
i
--
i
think
i've
been
confused.
i
have
said
in
--
in
my
first
point
is
it
one
properly
raised.
now,
i
think
when
you
say
a
case
doesn't
prove
or
a
state
doesn't
prove
a
prima
facie
case
that
covers
the
world.
so
in
a
sense,
it
was
raised
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
our
court
could
under
its
rules
go
into
the
matter,
but
this
question
of
vagueness
was
not
raised
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well
of
course,
i
assume
our
court
can
consider
anything.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
--
during
the
petitions
for
rehearing,
they
could.
they
could've
granted
a
rehearing
and
considered
them.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
they
did
not
mention
it
in
the
petition
of
rehearing.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
never
been
presented
until
we
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
--
until
we
got
here.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
it
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
it.
it
was
never
presented.
i
believed
it
first
showed
up
in
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
it
was
the
first
time
that
this
came
up.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
--
it
was
really
a
companion
and
in
this
case,
in
the
barr
case,
they
said,
"we're
not
going
to
consider
it
because
the
exceptions
don't
comply
with
our
rules."
in
the
bouie
case,
they
did
comment
in
one
sentence,
i
believe
in
the
opinion,
that
in
discussing
the
resisting
arrest
question,
they
said
they're
obviously
guilty
of
trespass.
now,
whether
there
was
--
their
theory
was
--
was
a
theory
i'm
proposing
that
they
had
noticed
before
they
went
in,
or
whether
it
was
refusal
to
enter,
it's
impossible
to
tell
on
the
right.
in
short,
it's
our
position
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
would
be
highly
improper
to
--
to
rule
that
the
lower
court
is
an
error
on
a
ground,
which
it
never
had
the
opportunity
to
conserve
it.
and
we
submit
that
that
basis
of
the
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
if
the
court
concluded
that
they
had
actual
notice,
then
of
course
they
would've
been
forewarned.
now,
if
the
court
concluded
that
that
actual
notice
didn't
count.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
did
not
count,
i
mean,
that
you
couldn't
consider
that,
then
you
would
be
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
refusal
to
leave
was
--
or
that
kind
of
construction
was
vague,
but
it's
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
they
did
refuse.
you
mean
that
you
--
you
say
that
--
that
you
will
not
--
that
the
only
way
our
statute
can
be
construed
is
forewarning.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
the
only
evidence
we
have
of
that
is
their
actual
knowledge.
now,
short
of
that
we
have
none.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
that
means,
your
honor.
i
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
none,
none.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
not.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
not,
if
they
put
another
interpretation
on
the
state
statute.
of
course,
they
have
since
construed
that
statute
and
i
believe
their
construction
is
binding
on
your
honors.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
in,
it's
bind
--i
believe
that
the
state
court's
construction
of
the
statute
that
a
refusal
to
leave
does
violate
it
if
binding
upon
this
court
and
in
the
charleston
case,
they
did
make
that
decision,
which
the
charleston
case
really
was
a
companion
case
to
this.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it's
not.
i
understand
it's
on
the
way,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
but
we're
not
involved.
it's
not
here,
but
you
can
only
make
that
finding
if
--
if
you
were
free
to
interpret
the
statute,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say
and
it's
my
point
that
i
believe
the
state
court's
decision
is
binding
upon
this
court
as
to
what
the
statute
meant.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct
and
it's
our
point
that
that
absolutely
was
not
raised,
and
that
the
state
court
should
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
question
before
it
is
held
in
error
in
that
construction.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
charleston
against
mitchell,
230
--
123
s.e.2d
512.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
was
decided
december
14th,
one
day
before
--
one
day
after
barr
and
about
two
months
before
bouie.
they
were
all
decided
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
name
of
it?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
they
construed
our
state
statute
as
making
refusal
to
leave,
after
warning
a
crime
of
trespass.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
it's
possible
to
conclude
that,
but
the
--the
record
--
the
opinion
themselves
don't
say
so
and
if
--
if
i
could--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
but
the
point
was
argued
in
brief.
i
personally
went
and
looked
at
the
briefs
and
it
was
briefed
and
argued
in
the
charleston
case.
they
won't
raise
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
let
me
say
--
to
start,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record,
the
record
itself,
and
our
record
indicates
to
the
contrary.
one
of
these
petitioners
testified
he
had
eaten
in
many
public
places.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
he
testified
he
had
eaten
in
many
public
places.
there
was
--
the
stores
themselves
would
be
segregated
in
all
other
departments.
now,
in
all
frankness
there
was
at
the
time
on
these
cases,
most
of
the
lunch
counters
in
columbia
were
segregated.
it's
my
view
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
state.
the
state
is
completely
apart.
let
me
say
it
first
before
i
get
in
to
it.
it's
my
belief
that
custom
makes
our
law
and
that
under
our
form
of
government,
the
wishes
of
the
people
through
the
vote
and
through
our
system
determines
the
state
law.
it
is
not
vice
versa.
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
the
state
tells
the
people
what
to
do.
under
our
form
of
government,
we
tell
the
state
through
our
vote
and
through
our
choices
and
it's
my
belief
that
custom
makes
the
law
and
many
of
these
statutes
on
the
book
are
still
there,
the
--
the
eight
statutes
and
most
of
them
--
i
think
couple
on
them
this
court's
held
unconstitutional.
there's
no
question
that
--
that
they're
viable,
but
there
are
statutes.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
custom
proves,
it
wouldn't
work,
your
honor.
i
think
it
had
a
party.
if
i
could
try
to
change
the
focus
on
these
cases
a
little
bit,
as
to
what
we're
really
talking
about
in
the
state
action
aspect
of
it.
these
owners
have
taken
their
money
and
invested
their
money
in
a
store.
they
have
--
they're
in
this
business
for
profit.
they
made
a
judgment
that
they
can
serve
both
races
in
all
departments
except
the
lunch
counter
and
make
a
profit,
but
they
have
found
that
they
cannot
make
a
profit
in
that
lunch
counter
if
they
serve
both
races
and
so
they
have
chosen
to
serve
the
white
race
and
exclude
the
negro.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
the
private
owner's
decision,
no
matter
what
else
is
said.
he
wants
profit.
both
of
these
owners
i
believe
testified
that
personally
he
didn't
care
and
i
don't
think
many
of
them
do.
it's
strictly
a
profit
motive
involved
in
these
things.
now,
the
negro
comes
along
and
he
is
protesting
this
judgment.
he's
not
interested
in
the
profit
either,
but
he
has
a
racial
point
to
make
and
he
comes
in
to
the
store
to
protest
this
decision.
now,
the
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it's
derived
from
the
feelings
of
his
customer.
it's
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
your
honor's
comment
earlier
was
that,
if
you
go
all
the
way
back,
it
was
a
source
of
slavery
and
a
source
of
the
--
the
condition
of
the
negro
when
he
was
brought
to
this
country.
he
had
none
of
the
western
culture
or
civilization
behind
him.
his
--
his
manners,
his
morals,
everything
was
different
and
he
was
--
he
was
a
different
person
completely
from
a
white
person
when
he
first
came.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i'm
--well,
i'm
certainly
it
is.
there's
no
--
no
question.
it
comes
from
that
whole
background
has
started,
but
when
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
will
--
i
may
have
been
too
broad.
let
me
answer
you
your
honor
this
way.
i
do
not
think
that
the
slavery
law
created
the
segregation.
i
think
the
condition
of
the
negro
when
he
came
to
this
country
created
it.
i
think
there
is
some
difference.
i
believe
that
he's
--
the
fact
that
he
was
so
different
in
background,
culture,
morals,
sanitation
and
everything
is
what
accounted
for
this
segregation,
whereby
the
white
people
did
not
want
to
share
their
every
--
all
of
their
everyday
lives
with
him.
now,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
slavery
law
is
necessarily
causing
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
our
state
is
--
itself
is
more
and
more
mannered.
well,
first
of
all
let
me
say
in
this
area,
we
think
the
state
has
never
insisted.
well,
it's
true
that
we
may
admit
it
--
let
me
rebut
if
i
may
some
--
some
comments,
if
the
court
please.
we
--one
negro
went
into
clemson
this
year,
in
addition
to
the
one
ordered
in
by
the
courts.
two
neighbors
went
into
the
university
of
south
carolina
this
year,
in
addition
to
the
one
ordered
by
the
courts.
we
are
making
progress.
now,
this
thing
will
not
change
overnight,
but
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
they
did
not,
no
sir.
two
of
them
is
in
the
south
--
south
carolina
--
well,
one
in
the
university
went
in
on
the
court
order.
two
more
went
in.
in
the
sense,
it
was
a
court
order
in
that
it
was
a
class
action,
but
there
was
no
specific
proceeding
brought
for
those
--
those
other
two.
same
thing
was
true
in
clemson.
it's
true
that
was
a
class
action
decision
on
the
books,
but
there
were
no
separate
precedent
for
that.
charleston
has
been
ordered,
desegregated
with
respect
to
the
state
parks.
let
me
add
two,
that
there's
a
legislative
committee
going
about
the
state
now,
holding
hearings
on
the
state
parks
and
the
unanimous
settlement
at
these
hearings
has
been
to
keep
the
parks
open
and
to
open
them
next
year.
the
legislature
will
act
on
the
matter
next
spring.
it
is
not
foreclosed.
that's
what
i'm
--
i
would
like
this
court
to
know.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there
were
some
statements
by
various
politicians,
some
that
we
will
close,
and
i
think
the
parks
did
actually
close.
the
court
order
didn't
order
them
integrated
until
mid-september
after
the
summer
season
and
i
think
at
that
time,
the
parks
were
closed.
now,
the
legislative
committee,
the
problem
has
don't
back
--
has
been
back
and
the
legislative
has
lapped
and
the
--
this
committee
is
going
about
the
state
and
from
all
i
have
read,
the
parks
are
going
to
be
open
again
next
summer
because
the
overwhelming
--
someone
has
been
to
open
by
all
--
all
races
to
here.
now,
i
just
want
--
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
the
matter
--
isn't
an
end,
that
we're
not
state
park
business,
we're
not
necessary.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
the
law
itself
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
that
law
is
still
on
the
books.
yes
sir,
i
think
this
ms.
motley
is
correct
in
her
statement
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
there
is
usually
segregation
in,
for
instance
in
change,
yes
to
me
knowledge.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that
--
that's
correct
and
i
believed
it's
followed.
yes,
sir
i
think
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i'm
not
really
qualified
to
say,
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
--
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
--
i
just
don't
know.
i'm
not
really
familiar
with
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
believe
we
have
any
state
farriers
left
your
honor
but
i'm
not
sure.
i
can't
think
of
any
off
hand.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believed
that
statute
is
on
the
books
but
i
believe
this
court
has
declared
as
un
--
not
necessarily,
the
statute
but
the
purposeful
that
it
stands
of
unconstitutional,
we
do
have
immigration
in
our
carrier
stations
and
statute
is
following
them.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
most
of
the
restaurants
in
columbia
are
still
segregated.
there
are
demonstrations
taking
place
there
now,
which
began
about
month
so
ago,
up
until
that
time,
we
have
had
none.
the
lunch
counters,
most
of
which
were
the
big
chain
stores
like
eckerds
is
a
chain
store,
did
desegregate
over
year
and
a
half
ago.
the
taylor
street
pharmacy
and
the
barr
case
went
out
of
business.
they
shutdown
lunch
counter
altogether
and
put
up
vending
machines,
which
served
coffee
and
so
on.
they
no
longer
have
a
lunch
counter.
coming
back
if
i
may
to
the
point
where
these
demonstrators
or
petitioners
entered
the
store
in
protest
of
the
management's
policy.
they
asked
to
be
served
a
cup
of
coffee
on
one
hand.
the
management
persisted
in
his
policy
of
serving
only
one
race.
that
is
a
discriminatory
act.
at
that
point,
the
discrimination
has
occurred.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
has
been
absolutely
no
state
action
to
that
point.
in
fact,
the
state
is
not
in
the
picture.
it's
simply
a
private
individual
who
refuses
service.
now,
the
problem
comes
when
these
--
these
people
are
asked
to
leave
and
really
the
management
pulls
out
another
right
altogether
when
he
asked
these
people
to
leave.
he
pulls
out
a
property
right
and
that
is
the
right
to
determine
the
people
on
his
premises.
now,
it
can
be
argued
that
the
reason
he
asked
them
to
leave
was
because
they
were
negroes,
but
i
submit
to
you
the
real
reason
he
asked
them
to
leave
was
because
he
wasn't
going
to
serve,
which
is
the
act
of
discrimination
earlier.
in
other
words,
it's
like
a
--
a
boy
who
wants
to
buy
cigarettes
and
the
owner
refuses
to
sell
it
to
him
because
he's
too
young.
and
then
the
boy
stands
there,
well
the
owner
finally
says,
"leave
the
premises."
he's
not
saying
leave
because
the
boy
is
too
young
for
cigarettes,
he's
saying
leave
because
he's
not
on
the
business
with
him
anymore.
it's
the
same
as
the
owner
requesting
any
unwanted
customer
to
leave
and
this
is
the
property
and
at
this
point
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
no.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
--
but
--
but
the
decision
to
refuse
service
it
--
and
he
could
seat
them
until
doomsday
and
we've
got
to
constitutional
problem
before
the
court.
the
real
problem
comes
when
because
he's
not
going
to
refuse
to
--
because
he's
not
going
to
feed
him,
he
then
says
leave
and
that
is
--
he's
--
he's
telling
to
leave
like
he
would
any
unwanted
customer
and
he's
really
in
a
--
in
a
different
standing
at
that
time.
now
when
--
when
the
negro
refuses,
he's
--
he's
now
a
trespasser
as
to
that
owner
and
under
the
law
of
our
state,
the
owner
has
a
choice
of
either
using
self
help
which
he
can
do
in
our
state
or
of
calling
the
police
and
in
these
cases,
the
owner
chose
to
call
the
police
and
we
get
a
constitutional
question.
let
me
ask
you
now,
what
is
the
state's
interest
in
those
trespassers?
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
believe
it's
state
action
of
constitutional,
no,
if
i
may
explain.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
sir
i
don't
think
so.
there
have
been
prior
demonstrations
in
the
store.
the
evidence
shows
that.
the
bouie
case,
which
was
eckerds,
took
place
on
a
monday
and
simon
bouie
testified
--
now
there
was
--
the
police
testified
that
simon
bouie,
when
arrested
clapped
his
hands
and
commented,
"i
wonder
how
many
they'll
get
tomorrow"
and
that
tomorrow
was
a
taylor
street
pharmacy
case.
now,
how
the
police
found
out
for
sure
that
they
were
coming
to
the
taylor
street
pharmacy,
i
don't
know,
but
the
police
notified
the
manager
who
had
had
a
demonstration
in
his
store
the
week
before
and
knew
what
it
amounted
to
and
it
was
simply
a
question
of
the
police
being
there
anytime
knowing
when
they
would
come.
i
don't
believe
that
alone,
it
puts
the
--
the
state
into
the
picture.
it
would
mean
simply
that
if
you
know
a
crime
is
going
to
be
committed,
you
got
to
let
it
be
committed
and
not
have
an
officer
there
to
prevent
it.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
because
of
the
past
history
of
what
happened
on
monday
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
in
another
store.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
and
an
earlier
case
in
this
store.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
sir.
i
think
that
this
manager
in
the
taylor
street
case
had
made
it
clear,
what
his
preferences
were
and
these
were
demonstration,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
that
--
that
--
what
he
means
there
is
he
told
--
he
didn't
ask
the
police
to
arrest
these
people.
we
don't
--
we
can't
say
--
the
record
won't
sustain
it.
what
he
told
the
police
is,
"i
want
them
out."
and
they
were
working
to
a
group
in
the
sense
that
he
and
the
police
had
agreed
that
after
he
told
him
to
leave,
if
they
did
not
leave,
the
police
would
then
arrest
them.
i
think
that
is
that
fact.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct,
but
both
the
police
and
the
management
had
had
experience
with
these
demonstration.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
think
that's
--
they
were
working
as
a
group
to
remove
them
from
the
premises
if
they
refuse
to
leave
when
requested.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
but
i
think
the
decision,
and
as
i
would
like
to
explain,
the
decision
to
--
to
exclude
was
not
that
of
the
police.
the
decision
itself
was
made
by
the
proprietor
to
refuse
them
to
come
in.
now,
he
turns
to
the
police.
under
our
law,
he
could've
told
the
police
to
get
out
and
he
could
have
used
self-help
to
run
these
people
off,
but
he
chose
the
police.
now,
the
police
came,
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
see
--
it's
important
to
see
what
the
state's
interest
in
a
trespasser
is.
one
of
the
state's
interest
is
this
property
right
and
it's
true
that
property
can
be
regulated
and
it's
true
that
public
property
can
be
more
regulated.
what
the
primary
interest
of
the
state
and
a
trespasser
we
submit
is
keeping
the
peace,
because
if
the
owner
goes
to
self-help,
a
breach
of
the
peace
will
occur,
at
least
a
breach
in
the
layman
sense
is
going
to
be
bias
and
the
state's
interest
in
enforcing
a
trespass
law,
is
to
prevent
the
necessity
for
the
owner
having
to
go
to
self-
help
and
to
keep
the
peace
and
those
interests
have
nothing
to
do
with
racial
discrimination.
and
we
submit
that
when
the
state
comes
in,
in
these
cases,
the
discrimination
has
occurred
and
they
are
simply
enforcing
the
criminal
law,
which
itself
is
color
blind
and
applies
to
all
in
removing
these
people
from
the
premises.
if
you
hold
otherwise,
the
effect
is
going
to
be,
it
seems
to
me
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
--
permits
one
to
violate
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
without
being
prosecuted
if
at
the
time
he's
violating
that
law
he
is
being
racially
discriminated
against
by
another
private
individual,
which
we
submit
has
never
been
the
law
until
now.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
it
did
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
no,
your
honor.
the
only
law
on
the
books
that
is
even
in
the
same
field
is
this
statute
talking
about
carriers,
railway
terminals,
restaurants.
there
is
a
statute
cited
in
the
footnote
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
which
deals
with
restaurants
in
public
carrier
facilities.
there
is
no
statute
on
the
books
in
south
carolina
with
regard
to
private
eating
establishment.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
oh,
certainly,
if
the
law
itself
would
unconstitutional
--
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
that
the
law
itself
--
in
the
law,
i
haven't
--
i
frankly
haven't
examined
it,
but
from
the
title
of
it,
i'm
sure
that
it's
limited
to
eating
facilities
and
place,
and
determine,
for
carriers.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
lunch
counters
in
private
stores
i
believe.
now,
i'd
be
frank
with
your
honor,
i
have
not
reviewed
that
statute.
i
felt
it
was
completely
irrelevant
to
this
case.
if
there
was
no
way
to
tell
from
the
statute
where
it
applied,
it
would
be
probably
unconstitutional
and
vague
too,
but
there
were
no
--
there
were
no
ordinances,
there
were
no
statutes
other
than
that
one
that
applied.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
my
answer
would
be
that
in
peterson,
your
--
your
ordinance
was
clearly
and
applicable
to
the
restaurant
in
question
and
here,
i
believe
the
statute
is
not
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
your
finding
should
only
be
such
where
it's
clear,
that
the
owner
was
subject
to
the
statute
and
had
no
choice.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
the
problem
--
i
can't
argue
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
they
did.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
that's
our
position.
let
me,
if
i
may
in
fact
suggest
another
distinction
that
has
been
that
--
that
has
been
suggested
for
shelley.
it's
our
position
that
shelley
does
not
control
your
decision
in
this
case
and
that
it
is
distinguishable
on
a
little
bit
different
ground
than
has
been
suggested
had
you
done.
it
is
our
view
that
the
question
of
what
--
what
is
state
action
and
what
is
not
is
determined
by
--
determined
by
whether
or
not
the
state
makes
the
effective
decision
to
discriminate.
now
in
the
shelley
case,
the
negro
had
taken
title
to
his
property.
he
had
legal
title
to
the
land
in
question.
no
private
individual
by
rightful
conduct
could
deprive
him
of
that
title.
that
title
was
vested
in
the
state
law
and
no
one
could
take
it
away
from
him
except
the
state
and
the
state
was
faced
with
a
question
of
taking
that
negro's
property
away
from
him
because
he
was
a
negro
and
enforcing
a
covenant
or
not
enforcing
a
covenant
and
letting
the
negro
keep
his
property
and
when
the
state
decided
to
take
the
course
which
was
racially
discriminatory,
it
was
an
effective
part
of
the
decision
to
discriminate.
now
in
this
case,
the
decision
to
discriminate
was
made
by
the
private
proprietor
himself.
the
state,
we
submit,
had
no
part
in
that
decision.
the
state,
but
--
neither
is
a
state
enforcing
that
decision
because
the
proprietor
had
the
right
through
his
own
self-help
to
remove
these
people,
because
the
state's
interest
in
keeping
the
peace
with
such
that
it
intervened
to
remove
these
people,
thus,
we
submit
make
it
an
effective
part
of
the
decision.
in
other
words
that
if
the
owner
had
had
no
right
to
self-help,
then,
we
may
have
a
situation
where
the
state
is
becoming
an
effective
part
of
the
decision
in
moving
them
out,
but
where
the
owner
has
that
right
and
the
state's
own
interest
is
solely
out
of
keeping
the
peace,
we
submit
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
the
discriminatory
decision
and
this
we
will
submit
--
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
he
couldn't
convey
legal
title
more
than
he
owned,
i
don't
believe
that.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
well,
it
was
only
valid
if
sustained
by
the
state
court
that
that
covenant
was
only
valid
if
the
state
sustained
them
and
led
its
way
in
depriving
this
negro
of
his
property,
which
his
neighbors
couldn't
come
in
forcibly
and
take
his
title.
it
had
to
be
done
by
the
state.
our
situation,
the
proprietor
can
under
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
refuse
that
service
and
can
under
state
law
evict
this
trespasser
by
self-help.
we
submit
the
state's
participation
in
solely
that
to
keep
the
peace,
to
keep
the
party
from
falling
into
a
fight.
get
him
out
of
the
restaurant,
and
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
the
discriminatory
decision.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
that's
all
suggestion
of
a
difference,
you
might
consider
in
addition
to
those,
which
were
urged
on
you
this
morning.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
that
the
contract
involved
prior
owners
was
made
by
prior
owners
of
the
property
in
question.
of
course,
it
was
a
contractual.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
believe
the
property
had
changed
hands
several
times
as
i
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
i
don't
recall
in
the
record
indicating
any
--
anything
on
that
either
way.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
yes,
sir
and
this
is
some
of
--.
mr.
david
w.
robinson,
ii
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
our
position
that
we
in
this
case,
the
proprietor
has
got
the
right
to
refuse
to
serve.
it's
--
that
is
where
--
that's
our
case
is
what
we
submit
here.
that's
right.
in
conclusion,
it's
--
it's
our
position
that
--
that
there
has
been
no
state
participation
in
the
decision.
the
state's
interest
is
solely
that
of
the
peace
and
if
you
hold
of
that
interest
itself
is
--is
prohibited
state
action,
then
i
believe
you're
--
you're
turning
these
proprietors
loose
on
a
self-help
situation.
they
are
in
the
middle.
they
are
in
this
business
for
profit.
i
think
that's
quite
often
overlooked
and
they
are
bound
by
the
wishes
of
the
public,
by
the
customers
and
of
course,
no
decree
of
this
court
will
change
that
view
overnight.
the
--
the
--
the
proprietor
himself
quite
frequently
has
no
--
doesn't
care,
but
he's
in
this
thing
to
make
money.
that
is
the
problem
he
had.
we
thank
you
for
your
time.
