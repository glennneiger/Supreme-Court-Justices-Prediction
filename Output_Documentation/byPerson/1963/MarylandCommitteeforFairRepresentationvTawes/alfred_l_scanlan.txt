mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned
for
the
afternoon
recess
yesterday,
i
believe
i
was
attempting
to
acquaint
the
court
with
some
of
the
gross
discrepancies
in
the
representation
now
provided
in
the
maryland
state
senate.
for
example,
it
is
now
possible
for
approximately
14%
of
the
people
in
the
less
populous
counties
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
maryland
state
senate.
this
was
not
always
so.
the
careful
research
here
by
the
solicitor
general
and
his
staff
has
revealed
that
in
1790,
for
instance,
it
took
at
least
40%
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
maryland
state
senate.
this
percentage
has
dwindled
steadily
through
the
years.
in
1937,
it's
about
18%.
as
i
said,
it's
now
about
14%.
if
the
population
projections
are
anywhere
near
accurate
by
1970,
it
will
be
12%.
24%
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it's
according
to
no
formula,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
the
--
the
representation
in
the
maryland
senate
is
provided
by
the
constitution,
article
3
section
2,
under
which
each
county
gets
one
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
--
except
baltimore,
which
gets
six.
and
as
the
population
migrations
change,
it
results
in
a
situation
where
counties
that
were
once
rural
have
now
become
suburban
indeed
urban,
yet
their
representation,
except
for
baltimore,
is
frozen
at
one
senate.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh
well,
at
present
time,
it
is.
they
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it's
frozen
into
the
constitution.
i
think
up
until
the
temporary
reapportioning
of
the
house
of
delegates,
it
was
only
delaware
and
maryland
where
the
representation
in
both
houses,
senate
and
house,
were
riveted,
frozen
in
perpetuum
into
the
constitution
with
no
chance,
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute,
of
unhinging
except
the
federal
court
in
sincock
v.
duffy
on
frozen
event.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
that
one
house,
we're
completely
based
on
population,
which
is
not
the
maryland
situation
now
like
they
say
we
have
conceded.
the
new
jersey
attorney
general
says
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
conceded
that
the
house
is
based
on
population.
that
would
be
like
conceding
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
and
sets
in
the
east,
that
jupiter
and
the
moon
are
equidistant
from
the
earth.
the
fact
is
right
now
in
the
house
of
delegates,
the
disparities
were
large,
six
to
one,
and
even
now
36%
of
the
population
could
elect
the
house.
but
assuming
arguendo
that
the
house
of
delegates
of
maryland
were
based
squarely
on
population,
i
would
say
that
we
would
start
out
with
the
standards
that
i
think
should
be
applicable,
equality
of
suffrage,
but
it
might
be
possible
--
it
might
be
possible
in
order
to
recognize
the
county
as
an
instrumentality
to
provide
a
minimum
representation
in
the
state
senate
where
each
county
had
one
provided
that
the
numbers
of
the
senate
were
expanding
so
that
additional
senators
could
be
given
to
the
suburban
counties
like
they
were
given
to
baltimore,
there's
ample
precedents
in
maryland's
history.
they
were
given
to
baltimore.
if
the
suburban
counties
were
treated
as
fairly
as
baltimore
has
been
treated
--
now
baltimore's
population
is
declining
and
they're
almost
fairly
represented
in
the
senate,
not
quite
but
almost,
if
we
were
treated
as
fairly
as
they,
i
would
say
the
argument
would
be
pretty
good
that
the
--
that
the
legislature
had
done
all
that
the
constitution
requires
of
them,
but
we're
a
long
way
from
that.
but
there
is
a
precedent
for
that
sort
of
thing.
i
will
say
speaking
of
the
disparities
in
the
maryland
senate
and
referring
to
what
justice
clark
has
called
the
crazy
quilt
approach
and
what
the
solicitor
general
on
occasion
has
referred
to
without
rhyme
or
reason,
not
only
do
we
have
gross
disparities
between
the
urban
and
suburban
counties,
the
more
populous
counties
and
areas
in
the
city
of
baltimore,
but
we
have
even
within
the
classes
disparities.
for
instance,
baltimore
with
approximately
950,000
people
has
six
senators.
a
baltimore
county
right
next
to
it
with
over
500,000
now,
very
closely
related
to
the
city
of
baltimore,
annapolis
etcetera.
500,000
people,
one
senator.
the
senator
from
baltimore
county
is
elected
by
more
people
than
it
takes
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
maryland
state
senate.
and
i
want
at
this
point
maybe
to
dispose
of
this
nonsense
about
accessibility
as
a
ground
for
deviation.
do
you
really
think
that
the
senator
from
baltimore
county
representing
500,000
people
is
more
accessible
to
its
constituents
than
the
senator
from
calvert
representing
16,000?
i
suggest
that
the
senator
from
calvert
has
much
more
accessibility
to
his
constituents
than
the
senator
from
baltimore
county
or
the
senator
from
los
angeles
county,
five
million.
he's
accessible,
i
suppose.
but
i
guess
i
better
not
press
this
argument
too
far
because
they'll
turn
it
around
and
say
because
the
rural
senators
know
the
interest
of
their
constituents
better,
this
is
a
factor
that
can
be
taken
into
consideration
in
granting
them
more
representation.
they
have
a
cork
for
every
hole.
now,
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
and
i'll
deal
with
the
whole
house
a
little
later,
surely
we
have
what
justice
clark
said
were
incommensurables
of
both
magnitude
and
frequency.
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
justice
stewart
has
referred
to
as
the
simple
arithmetic,
we
are
in
dire
stress.
but
justice
stewart
is
right.
there's
more
to
it
than
that.
there's
more
to
it
than
arithmetic.
and
we
believe
that
malapportionment
on
the
gross
scale,
which
now
exists
in
maryland,
has
very
practical,
adverse
consequences.
it's
not
only
an
exercise
in
abstract
injustice
or
mathematical
inequality.
there's
a
great
deal
more
to
it
than
that.
a
number
of
years
ago,
mr.
lewis
down
there
and
a
pioneer
law
review
article
cataloged
the
adverse
practical
effects
of
long
continued
malapportionment.
since
then,
other
scholars,
other
lawyers
with
briefs
filed
with
this
court,
in
baker
v.
carr,
and
in
some
of
the
cases
before
you
today
have
done
it
on
a
general
basis.
but
i
can
truthfully
say
that
in
maryland,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
adverse,
harmful
effects
flowing
from
the
gross
malapportionment
about
which
we
now
complain.
i
believe
that
was
professor
mckay
and
mr.
pfeiffer
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
filed
on
behalf
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
this
case
that
cataloged
--
there
are
listed
four
categories
of
harm
that
flow
from
gross
malapportionment.
the
first
of
course
and
the
most
paramount
is
the
dilution
of
the
vote,
the
harm
to
the
voter
himself.
certainly
we
have
that
in
maryland
and
then
we
have
it
in
the
second
aspect.
in
maryland,
a
lot
of
money
comes
back
from
the
state
to
the
counties.
especially
important
is
this
in
regard
to
our
education
system.
this
money
is
returned
to
the
local
political
subdivisions
under
various
equalization
formulae.
now
these
formulae
have
been
put
in
the
statutes
by
the
controlling
body,
which
of
course
are
the
representatives
and
the
senators
from
the
less
populous
counties,
and
this
has
resulted
over
the
years
in
a
very
small
--
much
smaller
percentage
of
the
money
coming
back
to
the
big
counties
than
they
should
be
entitled
to.
and
this
is
important
especially
in
education
where
we're
struggling
in
montgomery
county,
and
i'm
sure
the
same
is
true
in
baltimore
county
and
in
prince
george's,
and
perhaps
very
shortly
in
anne
arundel.
and
it
has
that
therefore
a
practical
adverse
effect.
the
second
category
of
harm
which
the
american
civil
liberties'
brief
refers
to
is
the
neglect
of
urban
and
suburban
needs,
and
i
think
i've
touched
upon
that.
i
think
the
record
shows
that.
for
instance,
at
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly,
there
was
a
bill
proposed,
it
passed
the
house
a
substantial
majority.
and
this
bill
whatever
changed
the
return
of
money
for
education,
based
it
on
number
of
pupils
and
would
have
been
a
considerable
benefit
to
the
suburban
counties,
and
all
their
representatives
in
the
house
of
delegates
voted
substantially
for
it
and
passed.
it
was
of
course
a
beating
down
in
the
senate.
the
third
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh,
i'm
sorry,
in
all
four,
your
--
mr.
justice
black.
men
has
tend
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
no
separate
one.
it
--
it's
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
the
general
brief,
that's
right.
the
third
category
of
harm,
i
think
you'll
find
the
summary
of
category
of
harm
in
their
brief
at
pages
12
and
13.
the
third
category
of
harm
to
which
they
refer
is
the
so-called
legislative
stalemate
and
i
think
i
won't
delay
on
that,
but
if
our
brief
at
pages
61
through
64
summarizes
a
classic
example
of
legislative
stalemate
such
as
it
took
place
at
the
last
set
of
the
maryland
general
assembly.
on
the
one
hand,
a
house
of
delegates,
at
least
related
to
population,
at
least
a
substantial
majority
of
the
population
had
bare
majority
control.
it
didn't
have
enough
to
push
through
a
constitutional
amendment
but
at
least
they
had
a
majority.
and
on
the
other
side,
a
senate
completely
dominated
by
the
less
populous
interest.
they
were
logged
against
the
whole
session
and
out
of
ten
important
pieces
of
legislation
that
we
referred
to
in
our
brief,
seven
of
them
broke
down
in
deadlock,
so
we
have
that
category
of
harm
in
this
record.
the
fourth
category
of
harm
is
the
tenancy
if
the
urban
and
suburban
needs
are
left
unmet
of
those
people
that
go
somewhere
and
that
go
to
the
federal
government.
and
while
the
record
here
is
not
precisely
clear
as
to
maryland,
i
think
one
that
we
could
summon
some
of
the
former
mayors
of
baltimore
here,
they
could
tell
you
what
this
has
meant
to
baltimore
in
their
efforts
to
get
the
metropolitan
transport
authority
for
instance.
but
we
do
have
one
classic
example.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
said
baltimore
is
reaching
the
point,
mr.
justice
stewart,
where
it
is
almost
properly
represented.
but
over
the
years,
baltimore
at
one
time,
the
only
urban
center
of
maryland,
has
been
boxed
in
by
the
less
populous
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
that's
not
incorrect.
baltimore
looked
at
in
relation
only
to
the
suburban
counties
is
much
better
off
than
we
are.
but
baltimore
looked
in
relation
to
the
state
as
a
whole
is
still
underrepresented.
it's
reaching
the
point
where
they
really
can't
complain.
but
it
hasn't
reached
that
point
yet.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
if
i
put
it
as
you
put
it,
i
would
have
overstated
it.
i
didn't
say
that
all
the
money
should
come
back
in
absolute
proportion.
obviously,
some
areas
have
a
lower
standard
of
income
and
obviously,
if
government
is
to
go
on,
those
that
happen
to
be
more
affluent,
should
contribute
more.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
but
we
have
a
lot
of
poor
people
there
too,
and
the
school
budget
is
getting
astronomical.
we
contribute
heavily
to
the
state.
we
have
11%
of
the
population.
we
contribute
19%
of
the
income
tax.
i'm
sure
the
automobile
registration
tax
is
(inaudible).
i'm
not
arguing
--
i'm
not
arguing
that
we
shouldn't
contribute
more
than
our
per
capita
share
but
i
am
arguing
that
no
adjustment
in
this
equalization
formula
can
be
made
even
when
the
situation
of
the
suburban
counties
cries
out
for
some
state
assistance.
and
in
the
educational
field,
this
is
a
critical
matter,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
structure
of
government
should
be
rigged
so
that
there
can
never
be
any
change
in
the
formulae.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
in
part,
in
part.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
i
think
now
you
have
overstated
it.
it
is
true
that
montgomery
county
has
--
we'll
take
that
as
an
example,
baltimore
county
perhaps
in
relation
to
baltimore
has
a
similar
situation.
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
people
that
reside
in
montgomery
county
have
their
place
of
employment
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
i
am.
and
not
that
i'm
not
proud
to
be
a
resident
of
montgomery
county
and
a
marylander,
but
they
pay
their
taxes
in
montgomery
county
for
the
state
of
maryland.
their
children
go
to
school
there.
their
life
is
related
to
montgomery
county.
moreover,
as
my
adversary
admits,
there's
much
diffusion
of
interest
in
these
counties.
we
have
our
dairy
farmers.
montgomery
county
has
some
of
the
most
wonderful
agricultural
land
in
the
world.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
possibly
in
some
instances,
in
other
instance
it's
not.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
answer
to
it.
why
should
the
farmer
in
montgomery
county,
when
he
casts
his
vote
for
his
delegate
down
at
annapolis
or
his
senator,
have
his
vote
in
effect
count
20
times
less
than
the
farmer
on
the
eastern
shore
when
he
votes
for
his
delegate?
similarly
in
anne
arundel.
they
have
fishermen
in
anne
arundel,
some
of
the
finest
fishing
in
the
world,
just
as
good
as
in
the
eastern
shore.
why
are
the
fishermen
in
anne
arundel
discounted
compared
to
the
fishermen
on
the
eastern
shore?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
but
as
mr.
mcconnell
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
but
as
mr.
mcconnell
put
it
yesterday,
he
is
a
citizen
of
maryland.
he
is
governed
by
maryland.
maryland
makes
laws
for
the
fishermen
in
anne
arundel
as
well
as
for
the
fishermen
on
the
eastern
shore
and
they
should
be
treated
differently,
not
because
--
i
mean
they
should
be
treated
the
same
not
because
they're
fishermen
but
because
they're
citizens.
they're
people.
we
believe
that
representation
should
be
based
on
people,
persons.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
think
within
the
framework
of
the
american
system,
the
represented
state
self-government
based
on
persons,
not
occupation.
it's
not
what
they
do
but
it
would
be
irrational.
and
i
don't
dispute
that
excellent
theories
have
been
advanced
for
corporate
representation.
i
recall
however
that
our
spanish
and
italian
friends
experimented
along
this
line
in
the
not
too
recent
past
and
while
the
record
has
not
yet
been
fully
written,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
those
experiences,
both
to
the
nation's
concern
and
to
the
world,
have
proved
infelicitous.
and
i
say
whatever
the
rationality
of
corporate
representation
by
occupation,
by
banker,
by
seaport
and
with
all
due
deference
to
your
honors,
hypothetical
in
your
ruling
on
the
state
and
(inaudible)
diamond
mine,
whatever
rational
argument
can
be
made
in
another
context
and
in
another
tradition,
it
doesn't
hold
up
in
the
american
tradition
where
government
is
supposed
to
relate
to
people
and
people
are
supposed
to
be
treated
equally
if
they're
similarly
situated.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
pardon?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
don't
think
so
and
i
think
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
think
--
i
think
the
history
is
the
other
way.
i
think
that
the
original
practice,
the
original
tradition
has
been
deviated
from
in
many,
many,
many
significant
instance.
obviously
that's
true
or
these
states
wouldn't
be
here
today.
but
i
think
the
best
analysis
of
the
constitutional
history
that
lies
in
kindness
was
made
in
the
majority
opinion
in
gray
v.
sanders.
it
started
from
the
--
the
declaration
of
independence.
it
proceeded
through
lincoln's
gettysburg
address.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
all
right,
but
as
part
of
the
american
tradition,
i
thought
we
were
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
all
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
nothing
said
about
in
the
unit
rule
case
prior
to
that
time.
there
was
no
direct
case
authority
except
the
voting
right
cases
for
the
decision
reached
there.
but
the
court
took
into
account
the
broad
general
constitutional
purposes
of
analogous
amendments.
many
years
ago,
chief
justice
stone,
when
he
was
dean
at
columbia,
complained
that
courts
were
quite
willing
to
approach
a
new
situation
and
analogize
from
cases
decided
prior
to
that
time
but
were
very
reluctant
to
do
it
with
respect
to
statutes
and
constitutional
provision.
statutes
and
even
more
so
it
seems
to
me
constitutional
provisions
are
a
declaration
not
only
of
what
is
law
in
the
past
but
they
supply
a
premise
for
analysis
when
a
new
situation
arise.
now
in
the
past,
the
discrepancies
among
the
states
up
until
the
day
of
the
1900's
were
perhaps
not
too
significant.
but
when
they
reach
the
point
of
gross
absurdity
as
they
have
today
and
certainly
in
maryland's
case,
if
maryland's
case
satisfies
the
fourteenth
amendment,
anything
satisfies
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
just
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
a
rational
or
within
the
limitations
that
i
ascribed.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
think
--
say
when
montana
was
admitted
to
the
union,
i
--
i
do
believe
they
had
something
like
a
federal
plan
there.
and
i
think
at
that
time,
the
disbursements
of
population
and
the
very
thin
population
of
montana
would
produce
a
result
where
a
federal
plan
in
the
unitary
state
would
not
be
particularly
offensive,
not
resolve
any
gross
disparity.
as
i
here
i
think
--
oh,
one
point
i'd
like
to
make,
and
it's
made
in
our
briefs
but
i
won't
belabor
it,
we
have
absolutely
no
chance
for
a
relief
at
the
hands
in
the
legislature.
the
whole
history
of
maryland
is
a
proof
of
that.
the
only
time
they
did
reapportion
voluntarily
was
with
respect
to
baltimore
on
three
different
occasions
that
i've
mentioned
yesterday
and
the
other
last
occasion
was
the
special
session
that
took
place
after
judge
duckett
had
struck
down
the
representation
provided
in
the
house
of
delegates.
it
establishes
however
that
when
you
do
have
a
controlling
court
decision,
you
can
be
reasonably
sure
that
the
legislature
will
act
and
i
think
not
only
this
case
but
most
of
what's
happened
since
this
court's
decision
in
baker
v.
carr
is
proof
of
that.
now,
i
want
to
say
in
passing,
maryland
does
not
have
the
initiative,
does
not
have
the
referendum.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
maryland
constitution
for
a
constitutional
convention
every
20
years
and
dutifully
the
vote
has
held.
i
think
a
majority
of
the
voters
approved
it
in
1930
but
a
very
substantial
majority
of
those
voting
under
question
approved
it
in
1950.
well,
no
convention
has
ever
been
called
despite
the
fact
that
over
a
dozen
bills
have
been
introduced
to
the
house
and
--
i
mean
in
the
general
assembly.
many
of
these
bills
have
passed
the
house
incidentally
where
the
least
population
is
given
some
sort
of
a
fair
shake
but
they're
killed
in
the
senate.
of
course,
i
don't
think
there's
any
secret
about
this.
there
are
some
that
i
know,
some
senators
from
the
rural
counties
are
quite
interested
in
constitutional
reform.
we
haven't
had
a
major
overhaul
of
the
maryland
constitution
since
1867.
since
that
time,
we've
had
111
amendments
who
voted
to
it.
it's
a
hodgepodge.
it's
a
very
difficult
constitution
to
deal
with
like
many
state
constitution.
and
there's
only
one
reason
they
don't
call
the
convention.
it's
not
that
they're
particularly
against
constitutional
reform.
they're
afraid
that
the
convention
might
do
something
about
the
reapportionment.
i
don't
think
they
need
to
be
too
afraid
because
if
the
constitution
--
the
constitutional
convention
would
convene,
the
representation
in
it
would
be
the
same
as
now
exist
in
the
general
assembly
and
the
less
populous
areas
would
dominate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
recalls
to
my
new
jersey's
experience,
and
i'm
sure
mr.
justice
brennan
is
familiar
with
that
when
new
jersey
finally
achieved
its
great
constitutional
reform
after
a
hundred
more
years.
it
only
did
so
by
agreeing
in
the
call
to
the
convention
--
for
the
convention
that
the
convention
could
not
meddle
with
change
or
alter
the
representation
provided
in
the
new
jersey
general
assembly.
now,
i
think
that
we
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
representation
that's
provided
in
the
maryland
state
senate
and
for
that
matter
in
the
general
assembly
as
a
whole.
but
before
we
could
say
that
with
any
self-assurance,
i
think
we
ought
to
deal
with
the
burden
of
proof
that's
put
upon
us.
i
agree
and
the
assistant
solicitor
general
from
new
york
yesterday
made
much
of
the
point
that
there's
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
that
kept
coming
back
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
statement
to
that
effect
in
mcgowan
v.
maryland
and
no
one
disputes
that.
but
surely
side
by
side
with
that
elementary
principle
of
how
this
court
decides
constitutional
cases,
there
seem
to
be
another
well-established
doctrine
that
--
where
fundamental
liberties
are
involved,
civil
liberties
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
or
political
liberties,
the
right
of
free
speech,
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
religion,
the
right
to
freedom
of
assembly,
and
i
would
think
the
right
of
suffrage.
the
right
to
be
fairly
and
equally
represented
comes
within
that
line
of
cases
that
began,
i
suppose,
or
maybe
didn't
begin
but
are
referred
to
in
the
famous
footnote
4
by
chief
justice
stone
in
the
carolene
products
case.
it
seems
to
me
if
this
court
is
going
to
view
with
a
dim
light
eye,
legislation
that
attempts
to
impair
the
right
of
free
speech
of
an
extremist
agitator
where
the
right
to
free
exercise
of
dissident,
non-theist
group.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
of
suffrage
when
the
claim
is
made
is
being
denied
thousands
of
citizens
in
the
states.
but
then
the
standard
of
this
court
is
to
apply
is
one
of
the
careful.
i
won't
say
the
presumption
is
reversed.
presumption
of
constitutionality
may
still
be
there,
but
this
court
approaches
those
cases
with
a
slightly
different
point
of
view
that
it
does
with
mere
economic
regulation.
and
as
far
as
the
right
of
suffrage
is
concerned,
one
of
the
most
famous
cases
that
ever
reached
this
court
of
another
matter,
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
which
annunciated
the
principles
of
equal
protection
that
live
in
the
law
to
this
day
and
we
hope
forever,
they're
indicted
as
true.
the
court
remarked
that
the
right
of
suffrage
was
the
most
fundamental
because
it
was
preservative
of
all
the
others.
in
the
end,
no
matter
what
this
court
says
or
does,
in
the
end,
it
is
the
people
in
their
legislative
body,
congress
or
the
states
that
will
decide
the
fate
of
this
nation.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
a
special
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
if
the
people
are
going
to
decide
monumental
questions
of
state
and
federal
affairs
that
the
mechanism
of
government
isn't
perpetually
rigged
in
favor
to
some
and
against
others.
so
i
think
then
as
far
as
the
burden
of
proof
is
concerned,
we
can
say
that
we
have
established
the
prima
facie
case.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i'd
say
this,
justice
warren
--
justice
harlan.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
we
perhaps
would
not
have
a
union
if
the
representatives
from
the
larger
states
hadn't
agreed
to
the
famous
compromise
of
the
constitutional
convention.
i
don't
--
i
don't
dispute
that.
that's
right.
whether
or
not
the
--
whether
or
not
the
--
the
favors
of
the
constitution
would
have
cast
in
their
chips
and
gone
home,
if
they
could
have
foreseen
what
has
now
come
to
pass
in
baker
v.
carr
and
gray
v.
sanders,
i
don't
know.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
frame
of
reference
that
justice
harlan
put
it
to
me.
i
just
think
that
the
--
that's
difficult
to
answer.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
think
if
such
amendment
could
be
submitted
to
a
referendum
of
the
people,
i
would
have
confidence
in
it.
but
if
it
had
to
proceed
to
the
malapportioned
state
legislature,
i'd
have
grave
doubts
about
it.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
did
congress
have
the
power?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
don't
think
we've
perceived
that
far.
i
simply
don't
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
under
that
analysis,
congress
has
the
power
to
reach
down
to
do
many
things
in
the
affairs
of
the
states
when
they
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
i
see
no
--
aside
from
the
invidious
days
of
the
reconstruction
of
congress,
i
don't
see
any
instance
of
congress
so
acting
particularly.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
as
an
abstract
theory,
it
is
probably
sound.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i've
--
baker
v.
carr
is
true,
it
decided
only
that
if
persons
coming
to
this
court
or
of
lower
courts
alleging
gross
disparities
in
their
representation
in
the
legislature
have
stated
the
course
of
action
over
which
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
i
agree
that
the
--
the
court
went
over
than
that.
but
it
seems
implicit
that
in
the
decision,
implicit
in
the
decision
was
the
further
premise
that
if
gross
malapportions
could
be
established
and
no
reasonable
justification
for
them
could
be
advanced,
then
there
was
an
unreasonable
classification
of
the
type
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
you're
right
your
honor.
sometimes
under
questioning
by
certain
justices
--
i
don't
want
to
[laughter]--
i
stand
corrected
by
a
much
more
knowledgeable
authority,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
explicit
in
the
baker
v.
carr.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
hope
he
has
as
many
friends
this
time
as
he
did
last.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
am
--
unlike
the
attorney
general
of
alabama,
i'm
going
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
baker
v.
carr
is
still
the
law.
now,
under
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
though,
congress
--
some
members
of
the
congress
reacted
in
a
different
way.
there
was
a
state
of
the
constitutional
amendments
introduced
that
would
prohibit
--
well,
it
would
provide
that
lower
house
had
to
be
based
on
population
and
if
it
was
and
then
--
then
it
would
be
proper
for
a
state
to
use
other
criteria
in
its
second
house
but
i
don't
think
any
of
those
even
got
to
a
hearing.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
that's
right.
i
would
say
then
that
we
have
met
our
burden
of
presenting
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
burden
then
fell
on
our
learned
adversaries
to
rebut
it
then.
and
they've
attempted
to
do
that
by
two
or
three
lines
of
argument,
one
of
which
at
least
--
or
maybe
both
of
which
were
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
the
first
is
the
so-called
"federal
analogy."
now
i
don't
think
that
really
i
have
to
argue
the
federal
analogy
question.
it
really
isn't
in
our
case.
it
may
be
in
the
new
jersey
case
but
the
new
jersey
attorney
general
is
elected
to
intervene
from
an
amicus
curiae
to
make
the
federal
analogy
argument.
now
maybe
it
does
exist
in
new
jersey.
but
for
the
reasons
that
we
gave
yesterday,
it
doesn't
exist
in
maryland.
it
never
had,
at
least
since
1864.
baltimore
has
six
senators.
the
population
principle
therefore
has
been
taken
into
account
the
upper
house.
there's
no
analogy
to
the
federal
senate.
the
lower
house,
we
have
gross
disparities
of
representation
still,
even
though
much
more
reasonable.
if
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
i
didn't
--
i
said
that
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
oh,
it's
--
yes,
legislation
that
was
considered
at
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly.
the
last
session
of
the
general
assembly
was
the
first
one
where
we
ever
had
an
arrangement
that
the
lower
house
was
at
least
in
the
--
last
in
the
hands
of
a
majority
of
the
voters.
76%
of
the
voters
control
55%
of
the
representation,
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
ever
had
that
situation
along
with
the
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
but
i
must
be
candid
about
that
and
that
was
--
we
could
only
say
that
was
true.
we
took
montgomery
county
away
and
added
it
to
the
rural
--
the
less
populous
areas.
to
be
fair
about
it
and
to
be
consistent
about
it,
the
same
76%
of
the
people
that
live
in
the
populous
areas
can
elect
55%
of
the
representatives.
of
course,
that's
still
short
of
even
a
constitutional
majority.
i
know
--
i
know
the
case
that
our
adversaries
often
rely
on
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
still
is
in
good
law.
i
think
it's
been
severely
described
by
baker
v.
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
not
--
no,
not
in
accordance
with
the
population,
mr.
justice
white.
we
still
have
disparities
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
by
a
bare
majority.
a
substantial
majority
of
the
people
can
elect
the
bare
majority
of
the
house
but
not
enough
even
for
a
constitutional
amendment
in
that
house.
conversely
a
very
small
minority
of
the
people
24
--
well,
24%
can
elect
two-thirds
of
the
senate,
which
is
more
than
necessary
for
a
constitutional
amendment,
and
have
49%
in
the
lower
house.
i
think
that
under
the
various
categories
that
the
solicitor
general
has
referred
to
over
the
last
few
days
by
any
--
by
any
stretch,
by
any
analysis,
we
fall
within
almost
any
of
those
categories.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
within
the
percentage
limitations
that
i
mentioned.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
city
of
baltimore
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
yes.
i
think
looking
at
--
depending
on
how
you
define
metropolis
but
even
in
baltimore
county,
which
is
right
next
to
it,
and
towson
and
wilfred
and
those
places,
they
are
substantial
towns
in
the
city.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes,
there's
one
--
baltimore
is
the
largest
city
in
maryland
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
that's
right.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
silver
spring
were
incorporated
as
a
city,
it
would
be
getting
up
there
i
would
say
with
baltimore
but
on
a
respectable
level,
the
same
way
with
towson
and
baltimore
county.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
they're
close
to
washington
and
many
people
have
their
place
of
employment
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
all
right.
that's
fair
enough
to
say.
i
will
say
however
this
illustrates
our
adversaries
are
worried
that
if
the
minority
--
if
the
minority
rule
--
if
the
majority
rule
is
substituted
with
minority
rule,
we'll
have
a
tyranny
of
the
majority.
and
my
answer
to
that
first
off
is
that
you
have
the
election
between
the
majority
and
the
minority.
lincoln
put
it
rather
simply
a
long
time
ago
when
he
said,
"unanimity
is
impossible.
the
rule
of
a
minority,
as
a
permanent
arrangement,
is
wholly
inadmissible,
so
that
in
rejecting
the
majority
principle,
anarchy
or
despotism
in
some
form
is
all
that
is
left."
aristotle
put
it
a
little
more
simply
when
he
said
a
majority
is
more
likely
to
be
right.
but
they're
concerned
about
a
tyranny
of
the
majority,
yet
in
their
brief
they
admit
that
the
interests
of
all
these
counties
that
we've
lumped
together
as
the
five
most
populous
subdivisions,
the
four
counties
in
the
city
of
baltimore,
are
quite
different
and
they're
right.
if
we
become
a
majority,
i'll
say
this.
i'll
promise
this,
too.
we
will
be
as
nice
to
them
as
they
were
to
us.
so
how
can
they
--
how
can
they
complain
if
they
admit
the
interests
of
these
people
are
different.
immediately
if
we
get
the
representation
that
we
think
the
constitution
entitles
us
to,
we'll
suddenly
turn
around
and
be
a
monstrous
--
turn
us
monster.
i'm
sure
the
suburbanites
--
the
suburbanites
in
montgomery
county
will
have
interests
quite
different
from
the
people
in
anne
arundel
or
the
people
in
baltimore
county.
if
we
get
the
representation
we
think
we're
entitled
to,
we
will
have
to
have
coalitions
just
as
they
have
to
do
it
today.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
latest
statistics
in
this
general
area
show
that
it's
really
become
a
case
of
the
suburban
areas
against
the
big
city
in
many
problems.
but
that
may
be
so,
but
that
doesn't
detract
from
our
basic
premise
that
the
structure
of
government
within
which
the
framework
within
which
you
work
these
problems
out
should
they
base
it
primarily
on
the
concept
of
equal
suffrage.
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
i
think
i
have
a
little
time
left.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
it's
sleeping
late
in
the
working
day
that
maybe
little
time
after
the
alarm
but
i'd
like
to
take
advantage
of
every
minute
of
it.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
one
point
with
respect
to
the
house,
the
solicitor
general
and
i
are
in
complete
agreement
and
he
is
correct
when
he
says
that
the
same
people
that
are
short-changed
on
the
senate
side,
are
short-changed
on
the
house
side,
they
come
from
the
same
counties.
if
the
house
in
maryland
were
based
on
population,
the
less
populous
political
subdivisions,
the
19
counties
would
have
37,
not
63
representatives.
and
the
five
most
populous
subdivisions
would
have
105.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
we're
not
worried
about
the
house,
qua
house.
if
we
had
worried
about
the
time,
to
be
frank
about
it,
we'd
probably
have
to
start
new
litigation
if
we
wanted
to
attack
just
the
house.
but
from
the
beginning
we
have
attacked
the
senate,
we
had
attacked
the
house
and
we
had
attacked
the
general
assembly
as
a
whole.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no,
they
can't
block
quite
the
majority.
they
have
--
they're
--
they're
overweighed
in
the
house
but
they
don't
elect
the
majorities.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
think
he
and
he
spoke
himself.
what
he
meant
was
if
you
took
montgomery
county
away
from
the
five
most
populous
category
and
switched
it
around,
it
would
come
up
with
the
figure
of
36%.
i
was
trying
to
be
a
little
bit
more
consistent
and
not
play
the
numbers
game.
i
stuck
to
the
five
subdivisions
constituting
76%
of
the
population.
and
these
then
are
the
same
people
and
then
this
--
we're
in
complete
agreement,
are
the
same
people
that
are
short-changed
in
both
houses.
now,
one
comment
on
this
virtual
representation
point
that's
come
up
here,
the
idea
that
lawyers
or
businessmen
from
baltimore
county,
would
like
--
wouldn't
mind
being
represented
by
senators
from
baltimore
city.
well,
i
for
myself,
i
would
not
like
to
be
told
by
people
who
don't
represent
me
who
will
and
i
think
that
for
instance
that
the
people
in
westchester
county
in
new
york
ever
had
a
labor
under
a
system
like
that
and
they
were
represented
by
the
senators
from
new
york
city,
they
threw
up
their
hands
and
heart.
this
is
the
old
idea
of
virtual
representation.
i
don't
think
that's
any
representation
at
all.
one
other
comment
about
the
--
a
state's
right
to
prefer
in
interest.
when
we're
talking
about
the
state
doing
that
and
doing
this
and
doing
this,
who
are
we
talking
about?
we're
talking
about
a
locked
in
minority
that's
had
a
lock
on
the
representation
in
the
maryland
general
assembly
since
1866
or
1867th.
and
if
that's
the
state,
they're
correct,
i
say
that's
a
minority
power
locked
in
the
structure
of
the
government
of
the
state
exercising
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
represent
the
state
in
the
sense
that
the
people
of
the
state.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
but
we
haven't
had
--
we
haven't
had
that
opportunity
since
1867
except
to
approve
what
was
done
for
baltimore
but
even
if
we
had,
and
even
if
we
had
turned
it
down,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
we
couldn't
vote
away
the
rights
of
them
--
of
--
of
the
citizens.
even
if
a
majority
said,
"we
don't
care,
let
the
minority
rule."
i
think
equal
protection,
perhaps
due
process
would
prevent
it
but
we
don't'
have
that
in
this
case
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
deal
with
it
directly.
one
final
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
now,
there's
been
a
slight
change.
they
are
--
they
are
--
it's
a
little
short.
there
has
been
an
improvement
and
my
learned
adversary
says,
"if
we
just
wait
a
little
longer,
it'll
improve
a
little
more."
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
no.
i
think
they
have
doubt.
to
be
fair,
they
have
now
45%
of
the
representation
in
the
house.
they
don't
have
a
majority
in
the
house
but
they
have
an
overwhelming
majority
in
the
senate
and
they
can
initiate
constitutional
amendments,
they
can
block
anything
in
the
senate.
all
we
can
do
is,
initiate
and
perhaps
carry
bills
in
the
house.
that's
about
all.
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
well,
i
thought
the
amicus
went
further
your
honor
and
said
that
this
case
--
mr.
alfred
l.
scanlan
yes.
he
said
--
i
--
i
--
i
don't
want
--
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
i
understand
you.
i
thought
the
amicus
said
that
the
maryland
case
presents
a
situation
where
you
have
a
house
based
on
population
and
the
senate
chosen
on
another
basis.
it
does
not
because
the
fact
is
and
i
can
concede
this
away
if
i
wanted
to.
as
i
said
earlier,
if
you
like
conceding
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
--
in
the
west.
the
fact
is
that
the
maryland
house
is
not
based
on
population
and
i
gave
you
the
figures
as
i
started
the
rebuttal
the
way
this
--
if
that
were
the
case,
if
that
--
if
we
had
105
delegates
or
something
close
to
that,
say
100,
then
he
could
make
this
argument
and
then
my
adversary
could
say,
"this
case
involves
the
federal
plan."
i
don't
think
even
if
it
did
involve
the
federal
plans
make
any
difference
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
brief.
but
believe
me,
this
case
does
not
involve
a
federal
plan.
if
this
is
the
federal
plan,
then
any
state
can
avail
--
avoid
the
force
of
baker
v.
carr
by
just
creating
some
sort
of
a
second
house
and
you
might
as
well
have
not
decided
the
baker
v.
carr
but
believe
me,
your
honors,
it
wouldn't
mean
nothing
at
all.
