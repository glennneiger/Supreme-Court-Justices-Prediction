mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
as
i
open
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
development
in
the
state
of
maryland
within
the
last
14
days,
which
conceivably
could
have
some
bearing
on
this
case.
certainly
it's
in
point.
exactly
two
weeks
ago
today,
judge
barnes,
a
judge
of
the
baltimore
city
supreme
bench,
a
bench
which
has
general
equity
power
struck
down
in
baltimore
city,
the
districting
laws
which
had
obtained
there
since
1922,
as
mr.
scanlan
touch
upon
the
subject,
the
baltimore
city
situation
is
there
so
that
it
has
six
districts
and
each
of
which
is
a
state
senator,
a
prior
to
the
1962
so-called
stopgap
legislation
and
had
36
representatives
or
the
members
of
the
house
of
delegates,
six
from
each
district.
following
that
stopgap
legislation,
the
third
district
was
given
two
additional
delegates
and
the
fifth
district
was
given
one
additional
delegate.
and
i'd
like
to,
if
i
might,
because
i'm
probably
buying
some
trouble
by
doing
it,
but
that
i
call
to
the
court
the
population
disparity
which
existed
in
the
baltimore
city
legislative
districts.
the
first
district
had
a
population
of
94,761.
the
second
district
had
a
population
of
84,213.
the
third
district
had
a
population
of
278,759.
fourth
district
had
118,339.
the
fifth
had
223,417.
the
sixth
district
had
139,539.
the
court
struck
the
districting
down
on
the
basis
of
the
same
portion
of
the
constitution
which
is
in
question
here
relating
to
baltimore
city
and
that
specifically
requires
that
the
district
shall
be
set
up
contiguous
and
as
--
as
much
equal
on
population
as
could
be.
when
this
case
was
filed,
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
--
i
didn't
get
in
the
case,
but
the
attorney
general
came
in
and
stipulated
that
the
--
quite
obviously
that
population
disparities
which
existed
in
this
case
were
sufficient
to
violate
the
state
constitutional
provision.
on
that
basis
now,
we
have
--
well,
we
haven't
had
a
decree
in
that
case
and
--
and
i
don't
know
what
the
decree
will
say.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
formless
baltimore
city
in
relation
to
these
legislative
districts.
i
would
certify
to
the
court
in
this
respect
that
the
state
has
no
intention
of
appealing
at
least
on
that
point.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
will
get
into
--
whether
all
of
these
people
must
run
it
large
because
it's
at
least
questionable
whether
they
may
under
the
court
of
appeals'
first
decision
in
the
initial
reapportionment
case
which
is
in
this
record
and
which
followed
baker
versus
carr
and
--
and
annunciated
the
principles
in
baker.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
i
would
simply
say
this
that
40
years
ago,
it
was
districted,
as
i'll
develop
in
showing
how
baltimore
city
picked
up
the
six
senators
that
it
had.
40
years
ago,
two
additional
senators
were
added
to
baltimore
city.
now,
this
had
followed
by
a
few
years
an
annexation
provision
which
took
--
took
territory
from
baltimore
county
and
from
anne
arundel
county
and
added
it
to
baltimore
city.
on
that
basis,
they
then
had
six
senators.
it
was
--
it
was
more
nearly
in
population
equal.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
the
point
is
that
the
legislature
--
it's
a
situation
that
the
legislature
allowed
to
happen
if
you
want
to
put
it
on
that
basis,
that
we
had
a
40-year
situation
where
the
--
where
one
district
grew
while
the
other
didn't
grow
quite
in
proportion
to
that
district.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
were
it
just
happened.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
not
--
not
the
district
being
in
baltimore
city.
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
they
just
--
they
dropped
--
dropped
two
delegates
into
the
fifth
district
then
dropped
one
--
i
mean
two
into
the
third
district
and
one
into
the
fifth
district.
they
didn't
touch
the
boundary
lines.
they
simply
dropped
the
--
dropped
representation
into
the
district.
so
this
is
a
--
this
population
disparity
grew
through
the
years
much
as
--
much
as
it's
grown
in
many
of
these
other
cases,
which
would
be
for
this
court.
it
just
happened.
and
of
course,
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
plaintiffs
come
into
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
--
that's
--
it's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
it's
not
--
it's
neither
been
alleged
nor
do
i
believe
it's
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
the
court
did
comment
in
that
case
while
establishing
no
rationale
or
no
argument.
the
court
did
say
that
this
districting
plan
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
say
--
i
say
it
was
not
--
it
wasn't,
i
don't
think,
argued
at
the
time
that
the
argument
was
head
on
it.
the
court
did,
as
a
number
of
other
courts
have
done,
they
--
they
find
a
state
ground
and
superimpose
a
federal
ground
on
it.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
would
say
that
the
--
the
constitutional
provision
which
--
which
we're
here
to
talk
about
today
specifically
says
in
relation
to
those
legislative
districts
in
baltimore
city
that
they've
got
to
be
as
nearly
so
in
population
as
--
as
might
be.
this
is
not
so
with
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
but
the
constitution
doesn't
--
doesn't
provide
that
in
the
county
situation
with
reference
to
say
the
state
senators,
if
this
should
be
the
case.
in
other
words,
there's
no
mandatory
population
--
equal
population
requirement
on
the
rest
of
the
state
either
in
reference
to
the
senate
or
the
house.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
there's
a
difference
of
course
between
the
districting
of
baltimore
city
and
the
districting
of
--
for
example
the
--
the
county
system
in
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
the
county
system,
as
well
developed,
has
--
has
grown
up
since
the
earliest
times,
since
1637
when
st.
mary's
county
was
formed
in
the
state
of
maryland.
the
baltimore
city
districting
provisions
were
added
too
from
time
to
time
and
as
i
say,
the
--
the
legislature
set
arbitrary
districts
presumably
based
upon
a
general
population
basis
and
so
constituted
the
districts.
now,
with
reference
to
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
certainly
not
under
the
state
constitution.
you
want
to
know
under
the
equal
protection
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
it
may
be
less
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i'd
--
i
would
think
the
criteria,
they
might
be
far
less
justifiable
for
the
--
for
their
own
and
equal
protection
basis,
for
the
legislature
to
set
up
arbitrary
districts
in
baltimore
city
than
in
the
county
system
because
the
--
the
--
to
begin
with,
baltimore
city
has
been
--
really
it's
constituted
as
a
general
constituency
broken
down
into
legislative
districts.
the
counties
are
constituted
far
differently
and
for
different
reasons
and
--
and
on
different
criteria,
that
is
to
say
the
--
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
historical
basis
and
the
geographical
difference
between
these
counties,
baltimore
city,
and
we
have
a
different
--
different
situation.
requirement
--
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
perhaps
may
be
fairly
nearly
coextensive
with
the
requirements
of
the
state
constitution
in
respect
to
baltimore
city
districting
because
perhaps
a
disparity
could
not
be
showing
a
true
disparity
in
baltimore
city.
it's
not
that
large
a
city.
it's
a
large
city
but
say
this
--
this
opens
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
court's
question
but
i'll
--
i'll
try
and
answer
what
i
think
the
question
is.
of
course,
baltimore
city
was
taken
broadly
in
1851
out
of
baltimore
county.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
it
sits
--
squarely
in
it
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
--
and
there
are
many
overlapping
considerations,
population
and
other,
the
industrial
and
--
and
the
economic
considerations.
but
i
do
feel
this
way
that
the
baltimore
county
is
a
county.
it's
traditionally
been
a
county.
it
was
founded
in
1650.
it's
always
had
the
same
general
type
of
representation.
and
since
1837,
it
has
--
it
had
undeviatingly
the
same
representation.
baltimore
city
perhaps
is
in
a
different
posture
because
you
have
to
stop
the
city
limit
somewhere.
in
other
words,
the
state
chose
to
--
to
form
a
city
in
that
--
at
that
point
and
--
and
at
that
point,
the
--
the
criteria
applicable
to
the
city
of
baltimore
perhaps
became
somewhat
different
from
the
criteria
which
might
be
applied
to
the
county
because
the
county
of
baltimore
is
partly
--
i'd
say
partly
heavily
industrial.
we've
got
the
martin
plant
and
the
bethlehem
steel
interest
at
--
at
one
end
of
the
county,
in
the
far
end
of
the
county
(inaudible)
towson.
we've
got
heavy
population
and
we've
got
quite
a
bit
of
rural
country.
so
speaking
of
the
county
as
a
county,
it
--
it
has
--
has
a
diversity
but
it
is
--
these
interests
are
within
the
county,
the
baltimore
city
being
--
of
course
they're
in
the
separate
independent
subdivisions.
what
i
would
like
to
go
into
very
quickly,
if
i
might,
we've
talked
generally
about
the
maryland
situation
but
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
has
a
true
understanding
of
what
--
how
maryland
came
together
and
exactly
how
it's
constituted.
and
as
i
say,
the
county
goes
back.
we've
--
the
--
the
state
goes
back,
we've
got
a
deep
historical
tradition.
it
was
for
the
first
county
that
was
formed
in
1637
and
so
on.
we
have
--
we
have
23
counties
in
the
state
of
maryland
in
the
--
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
by
the
constitutional
convention
of
1776,
of
course
the
state
was
formed
some
short
well
before
the
formation
of
the
federal
union.
at
that
time,
state
senators
for
example
were
elected
by
an
indirect
method.
this
continued
up
until
1837
and
included
within
that
indirect
method
of
election,
votes
were
given
to
the
town
of
baltimore
and
to
the
town
of
annapolis.
now
in
1837,
the
situation
changed
somewhat
and
each
of
these
counties
were
given
directly
a
senator
and
baltimore
town
was
also
given
a
senator.
in
1850,
baltimore
county
became
an
independent
political
subdivision
and
it
was
still
given
the
one-senator
representation.
so
at
that
time,
each
county
had
representation
of
one
senator
in
baltimore
city.
in
the
--
under
the
constitution
of
1864
and
1867,
the
constitutional
conventions,
the
situation
changed
somewhat
with
reference
to
baltimore
city.
baltimore
city
was
given
three
--
rather
two
additional
state
senators.
this
was
right
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war
and
at
that
time,
certain
of
the
southern
maryland
counties
had
sympathized
with
the
confederacy
and
it
was
thought
that
to
give
additional
representation
to
baltimore
city
would,
to
an
extent,
wait
that
situation
which
existed
in
southern
maryland.
in
1900,
an
additional
district
was
created
in
baltimore
city
which
gave
baltimore
city
four
districts
and
four
state
senators.
in
1922,
it
was
added
to
--
to
give
baltimore
city
two
additional
state
senators
so
that
by
1922,
baltimore
city
had
six
state
senators
and
in
the
--
and
it
had
from
six
legislative
districts
and
--
and
of
course
representatives
or
the
members
from
the
house
of
delegates
in
the
city.
now,
appellant
has
made
some
point
that
population
has
always
been
a
consideration
in
the
composition
of
the
maryland
state
senate.
we
dispute
that
if
--
if
only
on
the
statistics
because
in
1920
when
baltimore
city
had
51%
of
the
state's
population,
it
had
4
of
27
state
senators.
it
receded
population,
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
--
and
received
its
representation
despite
its
population.
and
so,
the
balt
--
and
so
the
present
districting
setup
in
the
maryland
state
senate
hasn't
been
touched
since
that
time
in
1922,
so
we
come
to
this
court
with
23
counties,
each
having
one
senator
and
baltimore
city
with
its
six
from
the
districts
up
until
judge
barne's
decision.
now,
i'd
like
very
quickly
to
talk
about
the
geographical
makeup
of
maryland
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes,
sir?
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
indeed
that's
so,
although
as
we
point
out,
we
have
a
deep
county
tradition
in
our
--
in
our
state
government.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
no,
sir.
now,
because
it's
--
because
it's
important
in
the
scheme
of
this
case,
i'd
like
to
talk
very
quickly
about
the
geographical
makeup
of
maryland.
the
solicitor
general
has
--
has
talked
about
maryland
being
a
small
state.
indeed
it
is
small
in
relation
to,
for
example,
the
state
from
you
which
you
come,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
it
has
rightly
and
rightfully
been
called,
we
think,
america
in
miniature.
for
example,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
state
begins
on
the
--
on
the
coast
and
extends
to
the
mountains
of
the
west.
example,
on
the
eastern
shore,
we
have
interests
which
are
far
different
from
the
interest
of
western
maryland.
we
have
basically
a
farming
--
a
community
along
the
chesapeake
bay
area.
we
have
of
course
the
canning
interest
and
--
and
in
the
chesapeake
bay
area,
we
have
the
well-known
seafood
interest.
along
the
coast,
we
have
the
recreation
interest
and
we
have
assateague
island,
which
the
court
is
very
familiar
with.
as
we
go
into
southern
maryland,
we
have
what
is
basically
a
--
an
agrarian
farm
type
community
with
large
dependents
upon
the
tobacco
crop.
as
we
move
into
central
maryland,
we
submit
that
we
have
the
great
population
masses
of
baltimore
city
and
baltimore
county,
the
great
industrial
complex,
the
court
complex.
it
got
a
high
degree
of
--
of
population
concentration.
there's
no
question
about
it,
extending
from
perhaps
glen
burnie
and
through
the
dundalk
area
after
the
towson
area.
it's
just
one
large
metropolitan
unit,
high
concentration
of
--
of
population.
within
that
general
metropolitan
area,
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
one
hip
of
the
state's
population
dwells.
i
think
--
think
this
is
--
won't
be
disputed
by
appellants
or
by
mr.
scanlan.
as
we
move
west
out
of
baltimore
city,
we
--
we
had
frederick
and
washington
counties,
which
are
basically
farming
counties
in
washington
county
and
is
--
is
an
apple-growing
county,
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
for
a
great
period
of
time,
washington
county
and
allegany
county
for
example
were
depressed
areas.
this
resulted
from
the
loss
of
certain
wartime
type
industries.
it
became
highly
depressed.
allegany
county
at
this
time
is
a
depressed
area
and
as
i
say,
washington
county
became
so
depressed
that
it
--
it
had
to
go
to
the
federal
government
of
course
for
help
as
it
did
to
the
state.
it
was
--
it
was
in
bad
shape.
garrett
county
is
--
is
quite
far
out.
it's
on
the
little
boot
of
maryland.
it's
--
it's
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
the
state
and
to
an
extent,
it
is
also
a
depressed
area.
allegany
and
garrett
county
have
strip
mining
interest
with
which
baltimore
citizens
or
even
citizens
of
hagerstown
or
washington
county
couldn't
care
less.
they
--
they
don't
understand
that
they
don't
care
perhaps.
in
addition,
garrett
county
is
trying
to
develop
a
--
a
recreation
type
community
where
--
where
people
can
go
during
the
summer
and
the
winter.
now,
having
set
up
that
--
that
context,
we
say
that
we
have
--
we
have
the
same
representation
unquestionably
from
garrett
county
in
the
state
senate
and
from
kent
county
as
we
do
from
baltimore
county
that
is
the
basic
unit
of
one
senator.
now,
in
getting
into
what
i'd
thought
would
be
my
form
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
basic
questions
which
we
think
are
involved
in
this
case,
actually
the
basic
question.
we
think
the
--
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
the
makeup
of
the
maryland
state
senate
and
--
and
we
say
this
for
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
that
the
stopgap
legislation,
which
was
passed
and
which
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
is
certainly
not
perfect
apportionment
according
to
population
in
the
house.
nonetheless,
it's
the
type
of
apportionment
that
even
appellants
at
the
time
when
they
were
speaking
a
little
more
freely
agreed
would
satisfy
them
for
the
time
being.
it
was
called
stopgap
legislation.
now,
neither
the
lower
court,
that
is
the
court
in
anne
arundel
county,
the
equity
judge
nor
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
point
of
whether
the
whole
legislature
ought
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
we
submit
that
point
is
not
before
this
court
for
a
couple
of
additional
reasons,
that
one
of
which
is
the
so-called
stopgap
legislation
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
it
was
litigated
in
independent
litigation
in
the
calvert
county
circuit
court
and
it
was
sustained.
its
constitutionality
was
sustained
and
it
was
never
appealed
from.
and
further,
we
--
we
have
serious
doubt
whether
--
whether
this
court
at
this
time
should
consider
the
present
population
under
the
stopgap
system
for
this
reason.
the
--
the
trial
court
proceeded
in
--
in
other
words,
a
long
jump
was
taken
forward
in
the
question
of
population
according
--
representation
according
to
population
in
the
house.
if
this
court
intervenes
at
this
point
in
that
--
in
that
item,
we
say
that
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
spirit
of
the
pace
at
which
perhaps
apportioning
matters
ought
to
proceed.
for
example,
in
some
of
the
three-judge
federal
courts,
i
think
alabama
is
a
case,
the
court
--
these
courts
have
been
quite
frank
in
stating
that
the
apportionment
plan
which
was
then
under
consideration
didn't
meet
all
the
criteria
that
they
would
wish
of
apportionment
plans
but
that
it
was
a
step
forward,
that
it
would
do
for
a
time
being,
and
we
say
that
that's
the
kind
of
apportionment
with
--
that
we
now
have
in
the
maryland
house
of
delegates,
far
from
perfect
but
--
but
the
--
the
march
is
on.
we
think
we'll
get
--
i
believe
we'll
get
apportionment
according
to
population,
perhaps
strictly
so
in
the
maryland
house
of
delegates,
although
we
don't
have
it
now.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
would
say
it
will
make
my
argument
la
little
better,
a
little
stronger.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
--
i
--
perhaps
it
is
relevant,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
say
that
--
that
if
--
if
you
take
into
context
the
spirit
of
this
apportioning
move,
it's
apportioned
according
to
population.
and
in
that
context,
the
state
senate
already
so
considered.
now,
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
perhaps
went
to
the
heart
of
this
question
in
his
--
in
his
dissent
in
this
baker
versus
carr,
and
i'm
not
trying
to
reargue
baker
v.
carr
but
he
said
that
before
we
top
off
the
debasement
or
dilution
of
the
right
to
vote,
we
ought
to
talk
about
what
a
man's
vote
is
worth
in
the
context
of
--
of
--
of
our
institutions
and
the
context
of
our
constitution
which
we're
holding
up
as
the
absolute
yardstick.
and
i
would
be
frank
to
say
that
i
know
this
court
wants
help
on
the
question
of
standards
but
i
don't
think
it's
gotten
much
help
to
this
point.
that
standard
is
so
difficult
to
apply
when
looking
at
the
--
at
the
various
institutions,
the
state
institutions
that
--
that
are
called
into
question.
it's
--
it's
an
enormous
job
to
establish
standards
which
--
which
can
be
readily
or
--
or
somewhat
readily
applied
to
all
the
varying
circumstances
in
the
states.
now,
we
say
this
contrary
to
what
appellants
feel.
this
is
not
a
simple
voting
case.
this
is
not
a
simple
civil
rights
case.
not
to
any
of
those
cases
are
simple.
they're
important
rights.
we
say
that
tied
up
with
--
with
this
thing
is
the
basic
question
of
representative
government
and
--
and
i'm
frank
to
--
to
observe
that
i
don't
think
any
of
the
--
especially
the
consensus
of
courts
that
mr.
(inaudible)
cited
here
two
days
ago,
i
don't
think
that
those
courts
have
gotten
into
the
basic
question,
the
basic
problem
of
representative
government.
that
is
to
say
if
--
if
we
have
a
right
here,
which
this
court
has
--
has
--
the
court
has
said
there
is
a
right
that
we
have
to
--
to
consider
in
context
with
that
right,
with
that
right
which
the
plaintiff
must
articulate.
we've
got
to
talk
about
what
we
ought
to
have
in
state
government,
what
we
ought
to
have
in
state
legislatures
in
reference
to
the
vote
because
appellants
--
the
appellants
registered,
appellants
voted,
they
had
their
votes
counted
but
what
they're
complaining
about
is
that
the
time
their
state
senators
stepped
into
the
--
into
the
state
house,
it
became
smaller
in
stature
because
of
this
dilution
of
their
vote.
now,
certainly
it
ought
to
be
observed
that
before
the
--
before
a
comment
can
be
made
upon
the
makeup
of
the
state
representative
system,
and
we're
really
talking
--
when
we
talk
about
the
state,
we're
talking
about
the
state
legislature.
we've
got
to
talk
about
what
makes
the
legislature
go.
when
(inaudible)
goes
to
the
legislature,
what
makes
him
run
when
he's
a
--
a
delegate
or
a
senator?
we
say
that
the
courts
have
not
gone
into
any
of
the
criteria
that
--
that
--
that
are
quite
obviously
there.
for
example,
well,
i've
never
served
in
the
state
legislature.
i've
been
there
many
times.
i've
worked
there
eight
or
nine
sessions
and
i
know
that
there
are
far
more
important
items
in
consideration
of
even
a
single
piece
of
legislation
and
simply
to
--
in
other
words,
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
the
court
can
take
your
fourteenth
amendment
even
as
--
as
flexible
and
--
and
as
lou
says
its
standards
may
be
and
hold
it
against
the
state
--
hold
it
against
the
state
legislature.
but
until
you
talk
about
--
about
the
question
of
compromise,
the
part
that
compromise
plays
in
any
bill,
on
any
legislative
enactment,
for
example
the
--
the
last
bill
that
gave
--
that
created
the
constitutional
memo
to
give
baltimore
city
two
additional
state
senators.
what
--
what
was
the
reason
for
that?
well,
the
appellants
--
the
appellants
have
no
trouble
with
that.
the
solicitor
general
has
no
trouble
with
that.
the
standards
are
there,
easily
--
easily
applied
fourteenth
amendment
standards.
we
submit
that
they're
not
so
easily
applied,
that
this
situation
that
this
court
has
before
it
now
doesn't
lend
itself
readily
to
the
--
to
the
adoption
of
--
of
equal
protection
principles.
for
example,
the
thing
that
--
that
might
have
caused
that
bill
to
pass
the
legislature
which
gave
baltimore
city
two
additional
senators
is
politics,
pure
and
simple,
just
a
simple
play
of
politics.
the
compromise
element
was
--
was
apparent.
the
appellant
say
population
played
a
factor.
they're
just
saying
that.
the
record
is
the
void
of
--
of
this
--
of
this
fact,
that
it's
a
fact.
there's
no
question
baltimore
city
had
population.
so
when
we
get
into
the
representative
system,
when
we
get
into
those
state
legislature,
we're
talking
about
the
politics
that
control
the
situation,
a
party
control
talking
about
the
compromise
that's
quite
evident
in
any
bill,
talking
about
to
use
them
(inaudible)
vote
swapping.
this
happens
everyday.
it
happens
every
hour.
this
is
--
this
is
what
makes
it
turn.
this
is
what
--
these
--
this
is
the
grease
that
--
that
makes
the
squeaky
wheel
of
the
legislature
turn.
these
are
--
these
are
important
criteria.
none
of
the
courts
have
--
have
gone
into
it.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
--
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
--
if
the
court
determines
that
it
will
consider
the
house
of
delegates
under
its
present
composition,
i
would
say
then
indeed
we
should
go
to
the
--
to
the
whole
complex
of
state
government.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
responsiveness,
the
total
responsiveness
of
state
government.
this
depends
on
a
lot
of
factors.
depends
--
i
would
say
primarily
depends
to
a
large
extent
upon
the
strength
of
the
governor.
we
see
there's
an
executive
here
in
washington.
it's
become
more
and
more
the
thing.
the
governor
continues
the
legislatures
out.
the
governor
plans
the
programs
that
he's
a
strong
governor
if
he
rides
his
program
through
the
legislature
and
if
he's
got
a
legislature
which
is
not
opposite
to
him
politically.
this
may
make
a
difference
and
may
make
a
greater
difference.
in
other
words,
a
total
responsiveness
of
state
government
is
--
is
quite
important.
and
as
i
say,
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
understand
it.
in
other
words,
you're
taking
it
to
a
second
degree
in
a
sense.
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
simply
answer
this
by
saying
this.
i
understand
exactly
your
question.
what
we
are
here
to
argue
is
not
what
might
be
but
what
is,
that
is
to
say
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
to
be
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
--
against
that.
we're
--
we're
here
with
a
--
with
a
state.
a
--
a
state
is
called
in
effect
before
this
court
to
--
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
to
justify
what
we've
done
but
i'll
get
to
that
when
i
talk
about
burden
of
proof.
the
question
is
what
--
what
have
they
done
that
is
--
that
is
unreasonable
in
this
situation?
your
--
your
assumption
is
that
if
for
example
perhaps
a
majority
elected
a
majority
in
both
senate
and
the
house,
then
--
then
the
question
of
diffusion
of
political
strength
would
be
one
--
would
be
perhaps
a
bit
different
than
if
you're
talking
about
diffusing
your
political
strength
in
the
maryland
situation
now.
that's
--
that's
your
point
i
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
--
i
--
i
just
don't
know
whether
it
would
make
a
difference.
it
--
the
end
result
might
be
virtually
the
same.
but
i
think
appellants
assume
that
if
--
if
they
had
the
type
of
representation
they
think
they
ought
to
have
in
the
maryland
assembly
that
the
result
would
be
somewhat
different
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
--
and
--
so
most
specifically
when
they
talk
about
the
equalization
formula,
they
get
into
this
situation.
they
say
that
--
that
if
we
had
the
kind
of
representation
we
think
we
should
have
that
it
would
affect
the
--
the
equalization
formula
much
differently.
we
get
back
more
than
we
get
now.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
we
don't
know
whether
that
--
whether
that
can
be
assumed.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
it's
--
it's
entirely
possible
it
might
affect
all
of
these
things.
it
might
--
it
might
make
a
change
in
the
type
of
--
of
results
that
--
that
the
majority
got
out
of
the
legislature.
i
don't
know
whether
that
answers
your
question
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
say
that
it's
--
it's
justifiable
in
context
with
the
type
of
system
which
the
state
has
already
set
up
and
which
is
in
question
now.
again,
we're
--
we're
talking
about
on
the
one
hand
as
we
understand,
a
--
a
hypothesis
and
the
other
a
situation
that
is,
and
it's
the
situation
that
is
with
which
i'm
concerned
and
you're
concerned
of
course,
very
much
so.
there
may
be
a
difference
there.
indeed
there
may
be
a
difference.
i
--
i
would
be
able
--
i
would
concede
that
the
--
that
the
difference
in
the
basis
of
representation
might
make
a
difference
in
the
type
of
results
that
these
appellants
got
at
their
legislature.
it
might
not.
it
might
make
no
difference.
that
is
to
say
if
you
--
if
you
complain
about
the
quality
of
government
in
the
state
house
and
say
that
--
that
better
apportionment
will
better
this
quality
of
government,
it
may
not.
it
may
not.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
we
don't
know
and
--
and
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is,
i
think,
that
no
one
has
--
has
really
devised
a
deep
down
analytical
critique
of
the
system
with
which
this
court
has
got
to
deal
in
these
cases.
and
again,
i
say
you
take
a
--
a
fairly
absolute
standard
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
you
put
it
against
the
legislature
and
you
don't
even
know
--
i'm
not
sure
i
know
in
--
in
it
--
in
its
deepest
sense
what
makes
all
these
factors
go.
well,
what
part
of
politics
play
in
that
bill?
what
part
did
the
compromise
play
in
that?
when
a
bill
dies,
why
did
it
die?
these
appellants
seem
to
suggest
and
it's
quite
contrary
to
--
to
life
as
it
is
at
the
legislature.
if
the
house
doesn't
pass
a
senate
bill,
the
house
apparently
is
unresponsive.
a
great
number
of
factors,
anyone
who's
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
legislature
knows
that
a
great
number
of
factors
come
into
play.
a
bill
dies
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
represent
--
representative
government
in
context
with
a
system
that
the
state
can
validly
establish.
in
other
words,
we
say
representative
government
in
maryland
perhaps
could
be
had
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
thats
--
thats
--
i
say
that.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
and
i'm
sure
the
court
understands
me,
is
that
the
court
has
only
to
look
at
the
spade
of
cases
which
were
decided
early
in
this
--
in
this
reapportionment
thing.
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
virginia
case,
the
(inaudible)
case.
look
at
the
oklahoma
case.
look
at
the
washington
state
case,
the
colorado
case,
look
at
delaware.
these
courts
seem
almost
hypnotized
and
mesmerized
with
this
disparity.
but
the
disparity
standing
by
itself,
we
submit,
may
not
mean
anything.
that
is
to
say
this.
they
take
the
disparity
and
they
say
because
there's
a
disparity
and
various
discrimination
exists
and
they
assume
the
very
thing
that
this
court
must
determine
because
the
disparity
we
say,
standing
by
itself
not
taken
in
context
with
your
state
institution,
with
your
--
with
your
governmental
responsiveness,
with
the
makeup
of
your
legislature,
with
all
the
other
merit
of
factors
means
nothing.
and
yet,
this
burden
of
proof
becomes
important
because
they
take
this
burden
of
proof
and
they
say,
"mr.
state
--
state
of
oklahoma,
you
have
this
--
this
tremendous
burden
to
meet.
we've
shown
that
you've
invidiously
discriminated",
and
in
the
case
of
the
oklahoma
case
they
said,
"we
don't
think
disparity.
this
is
a
way
it
worked
in
our
case."
we
don't
think
a
simple
disparity
means
anything
but
we
do
say
that
10
to
1
is
too
much.
what
does
that
mean?
i
don't
know
what
it
means
because
the
court
justice
readily
could
have
said
8
to
1
or
40
to
1,
could
have
said
33
to
1
in
the
maryland
case
which
chief
judge
brune
said
in
the
dissent.
the
problem
is
where
--
where
do
you
stop?
if
--
if
the
court
is
going
to
--
if
the
court
is
going
to
determine
these
cases
by
an
8
to
1
disparity
or
5
to
1
or
3
to
1,
delaware
got
it
down
to
1
1/2
to
1.
you
can't
get
much
lower
than
that.
some
of
the
other
states,
for
example
we
know
california
has
an
enormous
disparity.
this
will
be
tested
soon
enough.
they
have
one
state
senator
representing
a
county
which
five
million
people
are
located,
has
set
off
against
an
upper
county
in
the
state
of
california,
a
disparity
of
431
to
1.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
think
it
works
out
to
400
and
something
to
1.
vermont
--
vermont
has
a
disparity
which
looks
worst
on
paper
than
california's.
but
vermont
very
well
may
have
the
type
of
system
which
this
court
will
find
rational,
that
is
to
say
representation
in
a
--
in
a
house
which
is
based
on
towns.
who
can
say?
who
can
say
that
this
is
an
improper
form?
so
we
say
the
disparity
question
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
it
very
well
might.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
when
we
--
we
get
to
the
type
of
answer
that
mr.
golf
from
new
york
gave
two
days
ago.
when
--
when
a
situation
gets
to
an
absurd
result,
perhaps
that
the
absurdity
itself
carried
to
an
absurd
conclusion
is
sufficient
there
on
which
to
perhaps
strike
it
down
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
of
course
that's
what
the
appellants
are
saying
here.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
the
question
--
the
question
then
would
be
whether
perhaps
under
the
--
perhaps
the
theory
would
be
of
--
of
someone
from
baltimore
county
who
had
no
representation
that
the
state
had
acted
unreasonably
and
that
while
it
had
given
representation
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
would
say
the
equal
protection
clause
and
under
the
--
under
the
baker
case.
i'm
not
trying
to
--
i'm
not
trying
to
reargue
baker
versus
carr.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
they
very
well
might
not
be
able
to.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
would
say
that
most
probably
under
baker
v.
carr,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
it,
that
the
court
could
then
look
at
the
general
assembly
and
say,
"we
think
that
population
is
a
factor
in
one
of
those
houses,"
or
it
could
say
--
and
--
and
until
the
court
speaks,
we
don't
know
what
you
could
say.
it
--
may
be
it's
going
to
be
a
factor
on
both
houses,
maybe
--
maybe
the
court
is
going
to
say,
"we
think
that
the
house
of
delegates,
which
--
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
population
representing
a
type
of
house,
we
think
that
a
--
that
a
standard
should
be
applied
somewhat
substantially
in
accord
with
population."
the
house
of
the
senate,
the
state
can
set
it
up
on
any
rational,
not
unreasonable
plan
that
they
choose
to
do.
that
is
the
--
and
--
and
this
is
precisely
the
point
that
the
courts
have
arrived
at.
now,
you've
got
to
decide
what
you're
going
to
do
on
these
houses
taking
this
kind
of
a
situation.
you've
got
an
extreme
case
and
i
don't
think
you'd
--
you'd
have
much
trouble
applying
some
kind
of
a
population
standard
maybe
to
the
house.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that
--
that
perhaps
could
be
so
if
the
legislature
would
stop
taxing
them
maybe.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
if
they
tax
them,
yes.
if
they
tax
them,
then
we'd
have
the
boston
tea
party
all
over.
we
say
this.
i
probably
talked
enough
on
the
burden
of
proof,
but
i
--
but
i
--
i
can't
emphasize
in
my
judgment,
kind
of
expiring
the
brain,
sorry.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
this
case
came
in
the
first
instance
before
the
trial
court
on
bill
in
answer
i
think
it's
somewhat
important
to
clarify
the
things
that
have
been
said
in
the
bill
because
this
is
of
some
importance
i
think.
we
say
that
initially
the
appellants
have
alleged
the
gross
disparity.
i
have
already
talked
about
the,
what
i
think
the
implications
of
the
gross
disparity
are.
there
is
no
question,
but
there
is
a
disparity
then
they,
they
--
taking
us
a
bit
further
seem
to
suggest
at
least
in
argument
from
the
brief
and
from
the
bill
that
because
of
the
gross
disparity
that
there
has
been
neglect
of
pressing
problems
of
heavily
populated
urban
and
suburban
areas.
now,
of
course
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
that.on
the
contrary
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
really
all
that
there
is
in
the
record,
the
court
may
find
it
quite
enough,
but
all
that
there
is
in
the
record
is
a
bill
of
complaint
with
some
statistics,
one
of
which
shows
population,
an
analysis
of
the
disparities
between
the
population
of
--
an
analysis
of
how
moneys
are
paid
back
to
the
various
counties
in
relation
to
the
way
the
paid
them
in.
now
secondly
it
seems
to
me
the,
the
appellants
alleged,
alleged
great
number
of
things
which
all
of
which
i
don't
think
can
be
laid
a
malapportionment,
certainly
it
isn't
shown
in
this
case.
they
talk
about
the
decay
of
large
cities,
neglected
expansion
of
suburban
areas,
financial
planning
crisis
in
education,
housing,
transportation,
water,
sewerage,
urban
redevelopment,
and
civil
rights
problems.
i
submit
that
none
of
these,
if
there
facts,
none
of
them
are
established
in
this
case.
it's
very
possible
and
i'd
like
to
go
very
quickly
to
the
cut
as
i
see
in
the
state
of
maryland
how
the
disparity
cuts.
it's
seems
as
if
taking
baltimore
city
versus
the
less
populated
counties
that
there
is
disparity
which
runs
in
favor
of
the
less
populated
counties
and
against
baltimore
city.
taking
a
disparity
between
baltimore
city
and
the
so-called
suburban
counties,
the
four
populous
counties,
the
disparity
seems
to
run
in
favor
of
baltimore
city.
taking
another
disparity,
there
seems
to
be
the
discrepancy
or
disproportion
between
the
more
populated
counties
and
the
less
populated
county.
so
perhaps
it's
too
easy
to
say
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
urban-rural
split.
it
may
have
begun
that
way
but
i
doubt
if
it
it's
all
that
way
now.
and
we
--
in
our
brief
we
tried
to
show
that
the
problems
of
the
suburban
counties
are
the
problems
of
wealth,
they're
the
problems
of
progress.
the
problems
of
baltimore
city
for
example
or
the
problems
of
one,
problems
of
need,
the
problems
of
the
smaller
counties
may
be
said
perhaps
to
be
somewhere
in
the
middle.
so
how
does
this
work
out?
if
apportionment
--
if
apportionment
--
the
struggle
for
apportionment
is
a
struggle
for
power,
and
i
think
it
is,
then
we
got
to
situation
where
the
more
populous
counties
may
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
protect
their
accumulative
wealth
vis-a-vis
baltimore
city,
vis-à-vis
the
smaller
counties
and
we
say
may
not
the
state
take
this
into
consideration
either
in
acting
or
not
acting
in
relation
to
what
the
apportionment
plan
it
wants
to
set
up.
we
think
it
may.
we
think
perhaps
too
little
has
been
emphasized
in
this
court
on
the
question
of
the
burden
which
we
have
running
with
us
as
a
state
in
favor
of
the
system
which
has
been
set
up
not
just
by
the
legislature,
or
by
the
legislature
changing
the
organic
law
of
the
state
voted
upon
by
majority
of
the
people.
in
each
case,
the
apportionment
we're
talking
about
that
is
result
in
for
example
in
the
baltimore
city
situation
and
that's
all
we're
really
talking
about.
this
has
been
attacked
quite
heavily,
it's
been
ridiculed
baltimore
city.
baltimore
city
is
different,
baltimore
city
is
not
a
county
if
it
were
treated
like
a
county
these
plaintiffs
would
be
in
here
still.
they'd
say
you
have
one
state
senator
for
baltimore
city,
this
isn't
enough.
they'd
be
in
here
alleging
disproportion
and
there
would
be
at
least
in
the
figures,
a
disproportion.
so
taking
that
a
little
further,
what
are
we
suppose
to
do?
what
is
the
state
rationally
to
do?
it
--
it
we
think
that
based
on
the
exigencies
of
what
developed
at
the
time
that
these
additional
changes
were
made
governed,
whether
or
not
additional
senators
ought
to
be
allocated
to
baltimore
city.
we
got
six
you
might
ask.
suppose
we
had
a
hundred,
what
we
say
you
don't
have
a
hundred.
i'm
setting
up
a
strong
man,
knocking
it
down.
i
say
that
six
is
reasonable
figure
based
upon
the
situation
as
it
develop
and
as
it's
worked
out
now
perhaps
in
an
overall,
on
the
overall
scales,
baltimore
city
in
relation
to
the
senate,
is
just
about
evenly
populated.
so
we
say
that
they're
very
well
made
now
to
be
a
cut
between
the
urban,
the
so-called,
well
between
baltimore
city
and
your
populated
county,
because
one,
baltimore
city
is
now
losing
its
representation.
it's
losing
its
tax
base,
it's
got
problems
galore.
we
can't
deny
that,
as
we
say
the
problems
they
have
to
solve
cost
money,
the
problems
that
sub
--
that
the
political
subdivisions
in
the
outlying
areas
have
to
solve,
are
problems
of
congress.
they're
problems
of
planning
and
sewage
and
the
appellants
alleged.
i
don't
know
what
they
are
alleging.
they're
alleging
perhaps
that
we
don't
have
enough
sewers
or
maybe
they're
alleging
that
we
don't
have
enough
planning.
but
all
you
have
to
do
in
the
maryland
situation,
at
least
in
these
suburban
counties,
is
to
go
into
those
counties
and
find
out
whether
there
is
enough
planning.
the
park
and
planning
commission
is
one
of
the
most
highly
developed
and
emulated
planning
groups
in
the
country,
whereas
in
suburban
sanitary
commission,
by-county
commission
is
a
highly
developed
sewer
and
water
organization.
they've
never
gone
to
the
legislature,
been
denied
what
they
needed
for
these
counties.
and
appellants
can't
show
that
they
have.
where
do
they
got
their
money
to
do
these
things?
well
they
allocated
tax,
apart
tax,
they
allocate
a
sewer
tax.
the
money
comes
from
these
counties.
in
this
connection,
i
should
like
to
at
least
comment
in
passing
upon
counsel
statement
that
the
crisis
in
education.
this
crisis
in
education,
supposedly
in
planning
and
money
are
due
to
malapportionment.
montgomery
county
from
which
i
come
from
and
from
which
mr.
scanlan
come,
we
live
in
the
same
neighborhood.
the
money
for
montgomery
county
in
the
education
field
can
--
can
it
be
said
that
the
money
that
they
get
back
should
be
in
direct
relation
to
the
way
they
paid
it
in?
the
whole,
the
whole
structure
of
the
school
system
in
maryland,
the
educational
system
is
for
the
more
populous,
more
prosperous
counties
to
help
carry
the
burden
for
the
least
prosperous.
and
i
think
a
study
of
the
system
in
maryland
would
show
that
for
example
garrett
county
can't
carry
a
school
system.
it's
got
problems,
it's
in
most
of
their
--
a
lot
of
their
land
up
there
is
state
land.
a
lot
of
its
land,
it's
un
develop.
people
aren't
living
there
yet,
maybe
50
years
from
now
they
will
be.
montgomery
county
is
a
bit
different,
but
the
appellants
want
money
back
in
direct
relation
to
the
way
apparently
that's
paid
in
and
there
is
no
principle
of
government
that
i
know
of
that
requires
that
you
get
paid
back
in
direct
relation
to
the
way
you
pay
in.
i
submit
it's
not
a
maryland
system
and
certainly
hasn't
been
the
federal
system
it's
just
--
it's
just
--
it's
just
common
sense.
you
say
further,
one
of
the
main
allegations
apparently
if
you
cut
through
the
bare,
the
bare
bones
of
this
thing
is
that
the
state
senate
won't
pass
all
the
bills
that
the
house
sends
it.
we
say
that's
--
that
can't
be,
that
can't
be
standard
by
which
this
court
judges
the
responsiveness
of
the
state
senate.
there
are
all
kinds
as
i
say,
of
other
factors.
the
items
suggested
and
cited
by
appellant
or
not
after
bill,
there's
many
of
them
that,
that
there
are
very
serious
study.
for
example
there
was
one
bill
cited
by
appellants
as
showing
that
the
senate
had
been
unresponsive,
irresponsible.
it
failed
to
pass
a
bill
which
would
have
really
made
it
easier
for
some
people
to
get
small
loans
easier
and
of
course
it
would
have
raised
the
interest
rate
that's
the
reason
the
senate
didn't
pass
it.
it
wasn't
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
cited
as
for
example
of
progressive
legislation.
but
when
we
get
in
this
court
and
start
talking
about
the
merits
of
legislation,
we're
far
field
really
from
somewhat
this
court's
function
would
be.
now,
we
say
this,
in
touching
on
the
federal
system,
i
haven't
got
too
much
time
left.
say
what
you
may
about
the
analogy,
the
so-called
federal
analogy.
the
federal
system
is
not
a
pure
federal
system
even
under
contemporate
political
standards.
say
what
you
want
about
the
federal
system,
can
it
be
denied
that
a
state
which
sets
up
it's
system
generally
in
agreement
with
the
so-called
federal
system
that
this
constitution
which
we're
talking
about
will
find.
one,
irresponsible
and
unreasonable
and
protect
the
other?
we
say
this
is,
the
federal
system
itself
shows
the
general
reasonableness
of
the
plan
in
the
states
where
you
have
consensus
government.
this
is
the
proposition
advanced
by
professor
dickson
of
washington,
george
washington
university,
that
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
consensus
government.
if
you're
going
to
have
one
man
run
--
one
rule
--
one
man,
one
vote,
you're
going
to
have
endless
problems.
one
man,
one
vote
can't
be
applied
in
these
state
cases.
gray
v.
sanders
is
a
case
all
its
own.
you
may
--
the
solicitor
general
may
say
that
it's
dispositive
of
this
case
but
--
but
we
know
it
is
not
because
it
--
it
just
simply
can't
be
implemented.
we'll
have
district
line
running
through
my
backyard
perhaps,
and
we'll
have
endless
litigation
for
years
to
come
on
this
so-called
one
man,
one
vote.
because
all
that
has
to
happen
is
for
the
federal
government
to
take
for
example
a
--
a
federal
installation
and
put
it
in
garrett
county,
which
withdraw
within
three
years,
two
years,
50,000
people
to
garrett
county.
immediately,
the
whole
system's
thrown
into
--
into
an
imbalance
because
population
is
your
standard,
so
we
say
that
--
that
one
man,
one
vote
isn't
helping
this
court
at
all.
when
you
--
when
--
when
appellants
and
the
solicitor
general
come
before
this
court
and
set
a
standard
such
as
that
or
something
that's
almost
next
to
it
or
almost
akin
to
it,
that
haven't
helped
the
court
at
all.
the
court's
still
reaching
out
for
standards.
now,
the
obvious
standard
that
the
court,
i
would
think
is
going
to
--
to
take
into
consideration
is
the
population
standard.
now,
we
say
this,
that
the
--
that
the
maryland
system,
if
it
has
not
arrived
at
a
purely
populated
basis
is
working
its
way
there.
we
can't
say
that
there
are
not
disparities
in
the
present
healthy
delegate
setup.
but
we
say,
based
on
--
based
on
what
happened,
based
on
the
various
court
cases
in
maryland,
the
action
of
a
legislature.
this
is
the
goal
and
that
this
court
ought
to
recognize
that
the
state
is
working
towards
that
and
not
intervene
at
this
point
and
consider
for
example,
a
senate
in
context
with
the
house
which
--
which
is
malapportioned.
we
say
this
malapportioned
in
the
spirit,
in
the
context
of
what
this
court
we
think
ought
to
be
doing
in
this
cases.
if
the
house
of
delegates
is
properly
apportioned
or
nearly
so
or
it
looks
as
if
it
will
be
so
shortly,
then
the
court
can
go
to
this,
squarely
to
the
question
which
this
case
i
think,
presents.
that's
a
question
of
whether
the
state
may
take
its
own
form
of
government,
may
setup
its
own
form
of
government
as
it
has
here,
and
not
deviate
from
it.
how
--
how
reasonable,
how
rationale
must
we
be
to
satisfy
the
solicitor
general?
so
from
the
beginning,
history,
geography
supports
our
position.
we've
never
changed.
each
county
has
had
one
representative.
as
we
say,
the
legislature,
as
the
years
have
gone
through,
can
look
at
this
situation
and
see
this,
this
thing
that's
growing
up.
sure,
there's
a
population
growth
in
the
suburbs,
but
the
state
--
this
is
the
--
this
thing
up
here,
the
state,
we
talked
about
it
but
it's
a
--
it's
really
hard
to
picture
it
really.
the
state
has
looked
through
its
legislature
at
these
developments
and
it
says,
we
--
we'd
like
not
to
have
as
we'd
illustrate
it,
we'd
like
not
to
have
baltimore
city
and
baltimore
county
which
right
now,
have
almost
half
the
population
there
on
the
center
of
maryland,
have
a
rule,
majority
rule
in
both
houses.
may
not
the
state
do
that?
because
if
the
state
doesn't
have
the
right
to
do
that
then
i
suggest
you
talk
about
minority
rights.
minority
rights
will
truly
be
submerged
in
maryland
and
will
submerge
in
any
other
state
where
this
type
of
thing
happens.
because
if
we
go
to
a
population
basis
that
the
appellant
suggest
in
maryland,
we're
going
to
have
a
complete
submerge
of
--
of
the
rights
of
the
majo
--
of
the
minority,
because
even
now,
with
baltimore
counties
progressing
--
progression
in
population,
it
won't
be
very
long
before
as
i
say,
baltimore
city
and
baltimore
county,
they
have
--
they
have
an
identity
in
some
extent
--
to
some
extent
of
interest.
they're
the
logical
ones
to
want
to
see
its
power
and
when
we
say
see
its
power
in
our
argument
of
brief,
and
the
newspapers
took
it
up
as
--
as
indicating
something
more
insidious.
we
don't
mean
that,
this
is
--
this
is
a
question
of
power,
sheer
power
in
the
legislature.
if
you've
got
the
votes,
you
may
want
to
do
something
with
those
votes.
you
may
want
to
vote
in
something
that
isn't
in
the
interest
of
the
state
at
large.
this
is
the
problem;
this
is
what
we're
worried
about.
we
say
that
the
state
may
--
may
look
at
its
own
system
and
may
set
off
these
various
interests
in
its
state
senate
which
it
had
done
here.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
we
say
this
that
in
reference
to
the
state
senate,
if
you
have
a
house
that
looks
to
the,
generally
to
the
population
factor,
that
the
state
may
look
to
other
criteria.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
we
say
simply
that
--
that
what
the
appellants
are
asking
here
is
to
place
the
political
power
in
a
very
close
area
which
is
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
geographical
area,
works
out
that
way
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
it
happens
to
work
out
that
way
but
it's
not
geog
--
geography
would
not
be
the
consideration,
perhaps
economic
interest,
the
power
of
the
purse
in
baltimore
city.
it's
the
central
city
in
the
state,
it
controls
the
--
controls
the
purse
strings,
it
controls
the
money.
really
the
seat
of
government
is
in
baltimore,
the
state
capital's
in
annapolis
but
many
of
the
major
--
major
state
agencies
are
situated
in
baltimore.
so
we've
got
this
type
of
thing,
we
got
the
power
--
the
--
the
economic
power
of
the
state
to
an
extent
--
settled
in
now.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
mr.
justice
black,
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that,
we
have
what
the
state
seems
to
have,
what
would
perhaps
be
the
better
type
of
system
is
a
consensus
form
of
government
which
you
set
off
interest
here
on
one
basis
and
--
and
interest
here
on
another
basis.
perhaps
in
the
house
of
delegates,
the
--
the
area
that
i'm
talking
about
might
be
well
represented
on
a
population
basis
in
one
house
and
be
able
to
control
that
house.
but
the
state
may
look
at
the
entire
system,
take
everything
in
context
and
decide
that
looking
at
the
other
system
in
the
state
senate
that
it
might
choose
to
give
lesser
strength
to
those
areas
which
if
it
we're
on
the
population
basis
would
dominate
the
second
house,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
the
right
of
suffrage
has
several
connotations,
mr.
justice
black,
if
they
were
talking
about
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
mr.
justice
black,
all
i
can
say
and
answer
to
that
is,
one
must
be
impressed
to
an
extent
on
what
the
founding
father
said
that
one
must
also
be
impressed
about
what
they
did
and
what
they
did
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
with
reference
to
the
senate
and
to
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
--
but
as
--
as
i
go
back
to
what
i
--
what
i
said,
there's
a
thing
that
impresses
me
about
the
federal
system,
no
matter
what
was
said
and
the
considerable
was
said,
mr.
madison
has
cited
on
both
sides
of
--
both
sides
of
our
position
and
rightly
so
because
he
said
things
on
both
sides
i
believe
and
that's
the
reason
for
amicus.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
what
i've
tried
to
do
here
today
is
to
say
that
though.
i
believe
that
our
position
is
simply
that
the
county
system
has
always
been
a
system
of
representation
from
the
earliest
times
in
our
government.
the
point,
the
point
really
is
whether
the
state
may
do
that?
and
that's
--
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
thank
you
sir
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
--
i
think
it
does
but
the
reason
i
refine
my
--
there's
a
difference
if
the
court
will
have
noticed
between
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
our
statement
as
setup
in
the
brief.
i
realize
the
rules
are
right
strict
on
that
point
but
i
thought
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
try
and
specify
what
i
thought
was
a
central
question
in
this
case
which
is
the
state
senate.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
to
this
we
say
--
well
we
say
this
that
even
if
the
court
finds
that
the
house
is
not
on
--
setup
on
the
population
basis
at
the
present
time,
that's
in
the
spirit
of
what
this
court
seems
to
have
been
trying
to
do
in
baker
versus
carr,
as
in
the
segregation
cases
not
to
arrive
at
some
point
tomorrow,
acknowledging
that
the
point
of
which
they
were
trying
to
arrive,
might
not
come
until
10
years
from
now.
but
the
point
is
--
is
a
state
working
towards
that
point?
now,
if
it
is
working
towards
that
point
which
we
submit
in
this
present
house
of
delegates
situation
we
have
that,
then
why
should
--
i
think
simply
as
a
matter
of
policy,
why
should
this
court
jump
then
in
and
immediately,
just
simply
jump
in
the
lower
courts
on
your
side
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
they've
moved
ahead
and
they've
setup
--
they've
approved
an
apportionment
plan,
the
house
of
delegates
has
approved
an
apportionment
plan.
i
think
the
house
of
delegates
will
do
better.
i'm
sure
it
will,
but
why
should
this
court
come
in
and
now
take
the
senate
system
and
set
it
up
on
some
basis
which
you
would
not
perhaps
otherwise
do
at
the
house
were
completely
apportioned
according
to
population.
we
say
it's
not
the
spirit
of
--
of
what
i
think
the
court
is
trying
to
do.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i'm
not
sure
i've
analyzed
the
--
the
results
quite
in
that
way.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
solicitor
general
i
think,
was
--
was
incorrect
when
he
said
one,
in
the
house
of
delegates.
i
think,
it's
two,
two
minimum
for
each
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes
sir,
i
mean
that
this
thing
ought
to
be
known.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well
all
i
can
say
in
this,
i
think
if
the
court
will
go
back,
i
think,
again
i'm
looking
to
history
but
i
think
the
history
of
this
thing
is
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
founding
of
the
state,
that
in
so
far
as
population
is
concerned,
that
they
gave
a
minimum
to
each
of
the
counties.
this
--
this
i
think
from
1776,
that
insofar
as
you're
talking
about
a
reasonable
state
policy
of
doing
this,
that
this
complies
at
least,
it's
been
consistent.
this
has
always
been
the
procedure
in
maryland
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
indication
from
early
constitutions
in
maryland
is
that
the
--
that
the
founding
fathers
at
that
time
wanted
the
house
of
delegates
to
be
based
on
population
admittedly
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
said,
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
hadn't
--
i
hadn't
made
that
same
conclusion.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
i
agree
with
that,
i
haven't
sat
down
and
--
and
analyzed
that
in
the
--
or
that
time
of
reference
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
23
sir
in
baltimore
city.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
at
the
present
time,
142.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
yes
sir,
there's
a
quite
an
involved
formula
but
it
is
--
it
is
on
population
basis
and
we
--
mr.
scanlan
set
it
out
to
the
bill
itself
in
the
back
of
the
brief.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
my
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
of
the
19
counties,
other
than
the
populous
counties
which
we're
representing
about
1
million
people.
i
figured
that
they
could
elect
45%
of
the
house,
now
the
--
and
those
are
my
figures,
i
haven't
gone
in
my
own
brief,
i
haven't
sat
down,
i've
got
in
brief
the
complete
analysis,
i'm
not
trying
to
not
answer
your
question,
i
--
i
simply
haven't
done
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
solicitor
general
has.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
statistics,
everybody
is
trying
to
get
statistics
working
for
them
and
some
are
more
successful
than
others
as
mr.
scanlan
has
been
in
talking
about
the
great
disparity.
oh,
this
is
a
problem
that
i've
tried
to
point
up
to
the
court,
the
disparity
in
there
may
not
be
critical
depending
on
the
look
that
the
court
takes
of
all
the
other
institutions
in
our
state.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
no
sir,
there's
no
initiative.
the
only
way
that
a
constitutional
convention
can
be
gotten
is
to
--
is
for
the
house
of
delegates
and
the
senate
to
call
one.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
the
last
constitutional
convention
i
think
was
in
1867.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
oh
yes,
in
1950,
the
question
was
put
to
the
people
whether
a
constitutional
convention
should
be
called
and
the
response
was
that
a
majority
of
those
who
voted,
although
not
a
majority
of
those
who
voted
in
the
general
--
that
is
a
majority
of
those
who
voted
on
the
question
were
in
favor
of
calling
the
constitutional
convention.
but
not
a
majority
of
those
who
voted
for
all
officers
will
be
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
well,
i
tell
you
how
the
legislature
viewed
it,
there
was
an
effort
to
put
through.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
those
were
introduced
which
never
passed
since
that
time,
we
took
the
--
i
think
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
took
the
position
that
since
the
majority
which
voted
for
the
constitutional
amendment
did
not
constitute
a
majority
of
those
voting
in
the
election.
therefore,
under
the
applicable
statute,
under
the
applicable
constitutional
provision,
it
was
questionable
whether
it
was
in
a
so-called
mandate.
this,
the
legislature,
may
had
taken
and
done
what
it
did
with
it.
that
it's
clear
that
the
legislature
has
not
acted
to
call
a
constitutional
convention,
that's
quite
clear.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
think
there
--
there
had
been
earlier
votes
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
i
--
i
believe
so
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
indeed
so
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
correct,
which
gets
me
into
one
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
on
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
you
will
recall
that
in
california
in
1948
and
1962,
they
had
the
same
kind
of
vote
put
to
the
people
in
reference
to
the
state
senate.
in
both
cases,
they
rejected
efforts
to
redo
the
state
senate
on
the
basis
which
would
take
the
senator
from
--
from
los
angeles
county,
perhaps
giving
him
some
company
in
that
county.
mr.

the
people
as
i
understand
who
voted
--
voted
most
strongly
to
--
to
have
this
thing
not
carried
were
the
people
of
los
angeles
county.
so
you
wonder,
it's
--
it's
entirely
i
propose
to
this
case
to
wonder
to
what
effect
the
court
should
give
a
vote
of
the
people.
i'm
not
saying
don't
give
a
vote,
don't
give
effect
to
the
--
to
a
vote
of
the
people
on
whatever
on
constitutional
amendments
or
calls
for
a
convention.
but
i
would
say
this
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
case,
thigpen
v.
meyers
in
the
washington
state
case,
where
they
struck
down
both
congressional
district
and
a
state
legislative
district
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate.
it
was
raised
by
the
defendants
in
that
case,
they
said,
“well
that's
one
of
our
defenses.”
a
man
--
a
question
was
put
to
the
people
just
recently
whether
these
should
be
setup.
these
various
districts
should
be
setup
on
population.
they
turned
it
down
and
the
court
there
said,
well
that's
a
--
that's
of
no
importance
to
us
because
the
rights
of
the
majority
ought
not
to
be
carried
by
a
rule
--
by
a
vote
of
the
majority.
so
i
--
i
don't
know
what
effect
i
give
to
this
except
to
say,
it
may
or
may
not
be
important
in
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
bourbon
no
sir,
we
have
no
initiative
but
i
again
not
to
be
in
any
sense
flip
on
the
inch
i
say,
that
the
question
isn't
whether
the
legislature
wouldn't
apportion
because
quite
--
this
is
self-evident,
the
legislatures
have
not
done
it.
the
question
is
whether
the
system
that's
in
existence.
the
system
that's
in
question
here
is
one
which
this
court
feel
squares
with
the
whatever
requirements
the
court
is
going
to
say
that
the
equal
protection
law
establishes.
