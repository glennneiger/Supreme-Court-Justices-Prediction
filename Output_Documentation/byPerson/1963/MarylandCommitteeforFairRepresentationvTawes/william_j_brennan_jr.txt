justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
is
--
is
the
apportionment
of
the
house
as
revised
now
largely
population
based?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
house
of
delegates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
the
legislative
district
(inaudible)?
it's
not
county,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
house
of
delegates
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
they've
chosen
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bourbon,
may
i
ask,
how
many
--
how
many
are
these
ones?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
many
are
in
the
house
of
delegates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
142,
so
this
46
actually,
above
46,
two-third
count
of
the
difference
go
up
to
196
whatever
that
is.
is
that
on
a
population
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
a
population
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
in
new
jersey
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
21
counties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
senator
for
each
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
60
assemblymen,
i
think.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
assemblyman
guarantees
a
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
really
the
population
and
apportionment
then
only
39
senators.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
fact
is
we
guarantee
one
assemblyman
to
each
of
the
21
counties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
well
as
one
senator.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
actually
apportion
on
a
population
basis.
only
39
assemblymen
out
of
the
--
out
of
60.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
brennan
because
after
the
first
allocation
is
made,
the
balance
are
apportioned
on
the
population
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
39
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
19%
who
elect
the
majority
in
the
senate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
