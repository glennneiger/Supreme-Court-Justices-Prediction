justice
potter
stewart
in
baltimore?
i
thought
you
said
baltimore
was
overrepresented?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
complaint
now
is
that
baltimore
is
certainly
in
contrast
to
montgomery
county
and
the
others
is
overrepresented
and
going
to
be
more
so
as
time
goes
on.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
or
do
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
--
well,
it's
--
now
that
i've
interrupted
you,
i've
been
interested
in
your
argument
that
these
were
all
bad
things
and
it's
a
bad
thing
that
the
state
money
go
to
the
impoverished
areas
of
the
state
for
schools
and
so
on
and
--
and
not
come
back
totally
to
the
richest
county
of
the
state
like
montgomery
county.
are
we
supposed
to
weigh
these
political
issues
here
and
decide
this
is
a
bad
thing
or
a
good
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
montgomery
county
has
what,
has
the
highest
medium
income
of
any
counties
in
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
potter
stewart
now
it's
true,
is
it
not,
that
montgomery
county
or
a
large
part
of
it
and
a
large
part
of
it
where
there's
been
such
a
great
increase
in
the
population
is
a
socially,
economically
identified
with
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
the
idea
is
in
fact
a
dormitory
county,
a
bedroom
county,
and
i
certainly
don't
consider
that
a
pejorative
word.
i
think
it's
a
status
word.
i
think
the
people
in
greenwich,
connecticut
or
far
hills,
new
jersey
are
rather
proud
that
they
are
living
in
dormitory
counties,
but
it
would
certainly
show
that
a
very
large
part
of
the
population,
a
very
great
many
of
the
people
to
which
you've
been
referring
have
their
social
life,
their
economic
life,
their
occupational
life,
their
certainly
five-day
a
week
life
in
the
city
of
washington
and
the
district
of
columbia
under
the
police
protection
and
under
the
--
with
all
the
facilities
offered
by
the
district
of
columbia
and
to
that
extent
are
not
identified
with
the
state
of
maryland.
is
that
fair
to
say?
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
one
of
them,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
would
--
wouldn't
those
interests
be
represented
largely
by
the
representatives
from
the
other
agricultural
areas
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you're
making
an
assumption.
maybe
it
is
a
fair
one
but
i
still
haven't
quite
been
able
to
get
it
that
his
vote
counts
any
more
nor
any
less.
he
votes
for
a
representative
to
send
to
annapolis
within
his
district.
justice
potter
stewart
and
his
vote
counts
fully
within
that
district.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
suggest
that
--
wouldn't
it
be
entirely
irrational
for
the
--
for
maryland
as
a
state
to
realize
that
in
the
smaller
agricultural
counties,
the
people
of
the
state
are
completely
tied
to
the
land
and
to
the
state
in
every
possible
way?
if
they
are
stock
farmers,
they
can't
leave
even
a
day
unless
they
get
somebody
to
milk
the
cows
and
feed
the
horses.
that
these
people,
so
completely
and
intimately
tied
to
the
state,
are
different
--
have
--
have
different
problems
and
completely
and
wholly
identified
to
the
state
of
maryland
as
contrasted
--
as
contrasted
to
the
people
of
montgomery
county
who
leave
every
morning
and
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
where
they
worked
all
day
and
come
back
only
at
night
and
who
make
their
living
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
live
their
working
lives
outside
of
the
state
of
maryland.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
the
word
tradition
implies
history,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
we
talk
about
tradition,
we
talk
about
history.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
certainly
the
history
is
all
against
you,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
history
of
what
has
actually
been
practiced
in
each
of
the
states.
justice
potter
stewart
neither
one
of
those
is
part
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you're
saying
as
i
gather,
putting
to
one
side
these
six
senators
from
the
city
of
baltimore
for
a
moment,
you're
saying
that
if
there
are
these
population
disparities
among
the
counties
of
a
state,
of
the
size,
that
we
find
in
the
state
of
maryland,
then
it
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
a
senate
portioned
on
the
basis
of
one
senator
per
county,
period.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
you
would
concede
i
suppose
that
this
is
a
--
an
intelligible
system,
a
rational
system
within
that
limited
meaning.
justice
potter
stewart
one
senator
per
county,
you
say,
is
automatically
constitutionally
invalid
if
there
are
population
differences
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
this
magnitude.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
you
need
an
amendment?
after
baker
against
carr,
doesn't
congress
have
the
power?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
well,
isn't
it
the
logical
conclusion?
baker
against
carr
said
that
the
state
apportionments
can
run
a
file
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
the
last
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
authorizes
congress
to
enact
legislation
to
carry
out
that
amendment.
why
doesn't
congress
have
the
power
right
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
not
talking
about
the
probabilities,
political
probabilities,
but
tell
me
what's
wrong
about
that
analogy.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
follow
that
congress
after
--
since
baker
--
after
baker
against
carr,
the
congress
has
power
in
this
field
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
rural
and
urban.
it's
rural
and
suburban,
isn't
it?
i
mean
the
urban
that
--
the
big
city,
the
state
of
baltimore,
you
know
much
more
about
it
than
i
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
--
but
it
--
the
state
of
maryland
extends
pretty
far
east
and
west
and
it's
got
a
good
many
towns
and
various
interests,
it's
been
called
in
last
sunday's
paper,
i
think,
a
microcosmo
of
the
united
states.
but
there
is
one
big
metropolis
and
that's
the
city
of
baltimore.
is
that
right?
is
that
correct
factually?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
satellites
to
the
--
to
the
metropolis,
those
particular
ones
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
there
is
one
big
city.
justice
potter
stewart
almost
a
million
people,
is
that
it?
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
not
--
no
other
city
comparable
in
size.
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
these
other
counties
we're
talking
about
are
basically
suburban
in
so
far
as
there's
been
a
--
the
population,
and
then
the
suburban,
they're
the
--
the
--
the
city
to
which
their
satellite
is
the
city
of
washington.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
suburban
washington.
justice
potter
stewart
not
including
this?
justice
potter
stewart
there
might
be
quite
a
different
rational
explanation
for
baltimore
county,
i
suggest.
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
and
county
of
baltimore
have
seven
senators.
i
believe
the
rationalization
might
be
that,
that
area
is
fully
represented
by
those
seven
senators.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
really
know?
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
the
political
realities
and
the
political
forces
that
work
in
the
state
of
maryland.
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
how
much
community
of
interest
and
how
much
diversity
of
interest
there
is
in
fact
between
the
suburban
baltimore
and
the
core
city?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
it's
--
again
i
don't
know
but
i
suppose
that
generally
speaking,
the
county
of
baltimore
wouldn't
have
those
people
there
were
it
not
for
the
core
city.
like
most
of
suburban
counties,
there
wouldn't
be
suburbs
unless
there
were
urban,
unless
they
were
a
city.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
area,
if
there
were
no
city
of
baltimore,
those
people
would
not
be
suburbanized.
they
would
be
farmers
probably.
justice
potter
stewart
a
governor
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
constituency
is
the
entire
state?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
agree
with
that
position
but
i
didn't
think
he
took
--
i
thought
that
he
felt
that
a
very
close
to
a
bare
majority
of
the
population
or
very
close
to
a
majority
of
the
population
could
elect
a
bare
majority
of
the
house.
justice
potter
stewart
36%?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
also
that
the
--
this
is
what
i
don't
quite
understand,
is
between
you
and
him.
your
brief
says
that
the
disparities
favor
the
same
voters
in
both
branches.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
that
could
be
consistent
with
what
he
said,
what
he
described
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
well
then
--
well
then,
make
it
consistent
with
the
practical
effect
of
a
deadlock
between
the
two
houses.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
he
has
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
he
rather
feels
he
has
to
do
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
certainly
is
the
impression
left
with
me
because
of
the
situation
of
the
house,
that
he
was
in
the
house,
that
the
people
he
was
interested
in
they
apparently
could
control
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they've
provided
a
--
they've
--
isn't
this
suit
brought
under
--
under
the
act
of
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
apparently
lets
the
courts
adjudicate
this
sooner.
justice
potter
stewart
for
sure
i
would
in
fact
suggest
that
we
might
think
at
least
twice
before
we
accepted
the
invitation
to
lay
down
the
so-called
guidelines
rather
than
simply
to
decide
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
it
shall
have
enough
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislature
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
provisions
of
this
article.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bourbon,
just
so
i'll
understand
this,
this
case
should
you
just
told
us
about
involved
only
the
districting
within
baltimore
city
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
six
districts,
and
that's
not
before
us
directly
and
(voice
overlap)
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
same
way
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
it
involved
only
the
application
of
the
state
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
you
think
that
in
any
given
state,
mr.
bourbon,
it
might
also
be
relevant
to
inquire
as
to
the
basic
distribution
of
political
power
including
legislative
power
within
the
state
and
that
you're
aware,
i
suppose,
that
there
are
--
there
are
tremendous
variations
as
among
the
state
in
the
distribution
of
legislative
power.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
in
some
states
the
--
the
executive
has
given
a
great
deal
of
legislative
power.
in
other
states,
various
independent
boards
and
commissions
give
a
great
deal
of
the
legislative
power.
in
other
states,
appointees
of
the
executive,
the
governor's
counsel
has
given
a
great
deal
of
legislative
power.
in
some
states,
the
legislature
itself
has
almost
all
the
legislative
power.
wouldn't
it
be
relevant
to
inquire
in
any
given
state
what
the
actual
situation
is
in
that
state?
and
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
who
--
where
does
the
legislation
actually
come
from
and
what
does,
what
power
--
what
political
powers
within
the
state
does
it
represent?
well,
rather
than
just
to
look
at
the
--
in
the
state
and
the
abstract
as
a
state
would
be
at
hawaii,
which
is
a
series
of
islands,
or
north
dakota
or
maine
and
--
and
assume
that
they
--
they
all
have
the
same
makeup.
justice
potter
stewart
431
to
1?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
clearly
under
baker
against
carr
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
wouldn't
it?
why
not
i
just
say
so
and
go
on?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
baltimore
on
the
equal
protection
--
i
mean
maryland
under
the
equal
protection
clause
could
give
baltimore
complete
and
100%
home
rule
and
say
that
"you're
not
going
to
be
represented
in
our
legislature
since
our
legislature
doesn't
have
any
power
over
you
in
baltimore."
that
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
my
assumption
--
