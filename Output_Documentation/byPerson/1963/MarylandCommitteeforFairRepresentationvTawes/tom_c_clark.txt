(inaudible)
everyone
has
dealt
with
the
senate.
justice
tom
c.

there's
no
minimum
in
the
house,
is
there?
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
no
minimum
in
the
house
that
won.
justice
tom
c.
clark
every
county
does
have
one
representative.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
they're
both
anchored
to
the
minimum
of
one
representative
for
one
county.
justice
tom
c.
clark
two
for
each
county?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it's
the
same
principle?
your
senate
is
anchored
to
one
per
county
except
in
both
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
your
house
is
anchored
to
two
to
a
county,
now,
justice
white's
question
is
whether
or
not,
is
that
as
the
solicitor
general
claims,
fails
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
to
the
house,
with
reference
to
it,
being
population
wise
when
it's
anchored
to
two
to
a
county?
