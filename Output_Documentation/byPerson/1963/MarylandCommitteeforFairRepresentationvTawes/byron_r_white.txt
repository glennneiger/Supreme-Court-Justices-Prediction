the
present
house
of
maryland,
can
a
minority
elect
a
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
we
have
here
then
the
situation,
where
one
house
of
the
assembly
is
apportioned
to
the
satisfaction
and
in
accordance
with
the
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
--
do
you
have
at
least
just
one
house
that
is
elected
by
a
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
in
terms
of
rural
and
urban
(inaudible)

justice

general
cox,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
be
(inaudible)
in
the
baltimore
city
everyday.
to
that
extent,
would
it
be
six
senators
in
baltimore
city
who
represent
the
particular
professional
business
interest
of
those
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
so
but
i
would
suppose
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
industries
and
banks
and
professions
are
largely
--
they
were
the
people
who
spend
the
nights
in
baltimore
county
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
senators
of
baltimore
city
would
be
indeed
responsive
to
those
--

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
do
not
disagree
with
the
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
36%
i
take
it
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
to
your
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
states
has
in
the
constitution
that
the
both
houses
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
quite
clear
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
state
chooses
have
it
in
population
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
county
has
25
and
another
county
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
--
oh
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
some
exception
then
to
both
houses
being
equally
disproportionate
to
population?
i
take
it
you
certainly
pick
one
house
maybe
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
other
--
and
the
other
one
is
on
top.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
almost
got
cut.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
justification
for
your
--
for
your
one
house
is
that
there
must
be
some
check
on
the
majority
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
this
is
really
the
justifying
factor,
i
suppose
that
you
could
turn
it
around
and
say
that
you
should
have
some
protection
against
the
rational
minorities
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trouble
i
had
is
that
if
you're
a
--
because
guaranty
clause
argument
and
some
other
here
is
that
it
would
also
justify
both
houses
being
disproportionate.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
states
may
choose.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
states
may
choose
a
form
of
representative
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
if
we
have
a
probably
with
time
to
the
--
that
we
--
in
order
for
them
to
(inaudible)
but
also
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
it
would
be
correct,
