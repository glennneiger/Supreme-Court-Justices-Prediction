mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
devote
myself
to
two,
and
if
i
have
time,
three
subjects
in
this
case.
first,
i
want
to
simply
as
i
can
to
state
the
way
that
our
basic
analysis
applies
to
the
maryland
case.
second,
there
are
some
points
in
our
constitutional
history
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with
briefly,
and
then
third,
if
the
time
does
permit,
i
shall
try
to
deal
with
some
of
the
general
questions
that
have
been
raised
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
days.
it's
our
view
that
the
apportionment
in
the
maryland
legislature
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
two
independently
sufficient
reasons.
first,
we
say
that
apportionment
of
the
senate,
because
of
this
system
of
giving
one
senator
to
each
county
but
six
to
the
city
of
baltimore,
grossly
discriminates
against
baltimore
county
the
areas
surrounding
the
city,
but
not
including
--
mr.
archibald
cox
not
including
this.
that's
correct,
and
against
the
prince
georgia's
and
montgomery
counties
and
if
there
is
no
discoverable
reason
for
this
pattern
of
inequality
so
that
it
falls
on
the
same
ground
that
the
tennessee
apportionment
that
fell
in
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
in
baker
and
carr,
the
same
ground
that
we
argued
that
the
alabama
existing
apportionment
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
have
grave
trouble
with
his
suggestion
assuming
that
it
fits
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
contrary
to
the
whole
nation,
the
whole
system
of
making
us
one
nation
for
commercial,
economic,
business
purposes,
and
enabling
us
to
work
on
both
back
and
fourth
across
state
lines
and
move
on
to
work
on
one
side
and
live
on
another
as
we
see
fit.
as
applied
to
this
case
however,
it
doesn't
explain
baltimore
county,
which
is
one
of
the
worst
of
the
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
state
suggests
then
--
i
have
--
there
may
be.
i
have
thought
of
none,
but
would
fit
as
rational
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
say
that
the
people
elected
by
the
city
of
baltimore
represent
the
people
in
baltimore
county
seems
to
me
a
wholly
unwarranted
assumption.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
it
would
be
--
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
sheer
chance
if
they
represented
the
people
of
the
county
of
baltimore
on
any
substantial
number
of
issues
and
that
that
is
an
assumption
that
the
court
â€“-
that
the
legislature
can't
reasonably
make
without
any
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
would
have
many
people
there.
they're
going
to
live
somewhere.
there
are
local
interests
there,
all
kinds
of
divergent
interests.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
would
have
say
somewhat
different
life
than
they
do.
clearly
it
might
be
that
towson
would
be
the
central
city
if
baltimore
wouldn't
have
been
the
city.
but
i
do
suggest
that
this
notion
which
has
been
expressed
several
times
that
somehow
by
over
representing
one
group
of
people,
you
are
representing
the
people
that
live
somewhere
else
is
a
highly
unlikely
proposition.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know.
they
are
going
to
be
more
responsive
to
the
people
who
elect
them
or
who
on
many
issues
will
not
have
the
same
interest
even
in
the
business
ways.
the
people
who
live
in
the
central
city
for
example,
mr.
justice,
i
take
it
would
not
have
the
same
business
interest
as
the
bankers
and
management
people
who
live
out
in
the
suburbs.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
some
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
on
some
--
mr.
archibald
cox
on
some
questions,
it
would
undoubtedly
be
an
identity
of
interest.
on
other
questions,
it
would
be
a
very
grave
split
of
interest.
and
i
think
to
allow
a
state
without
any
evidence
that
--
of
what
the
committee
or
disparity
is,
especially
to
come
along
as
(inaudible)
and
suggests
that
this
is
the
rationalization,
is
to
allow
it
to
offer
a
wholly
arbitrary
assumption,
and
therefore
something
that
we'll
not
do
as
a
justification
for
inequalities
in
an
area
as
important
as
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
area
of
political
rights.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
tried
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think,
your
honor
will
find
that
i
have
directed
myself
to
this
quite
explicitly
during
my
argument
in
the
new
york
case.
basically,
my
argument
on
that
point
comes
to
this,
that
although
creating
this
kind
of
distinctions
maybe
is
clearly
permissible
in
the
fields
that
you
have
mentioned,
but
it
is
not
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
area
of
political
rights
both.
and
here,
we
take
our
stand
very
squarely
on
the
proposition
as
stated
by
justice
black
and
justice
douglas
in
(inaudible)
peters.
the
creation
by
law
of
favored
groups
or
citizens
and
to
grant
to
them
a
preferred
political
right
is
the
worst
of
all
discriminations
under
a
democratic
system
of
government.
now,
i
would
like
to
also
to
suggest
on
this
point,
mr.
justice,
that
of
that
proposition
which
is
a
limited
proposition
and
doesn't
resolve
all
the
questions
in
the
apportionment
case,
but
on
that
proposition,
i
submit
that
gray
and
sanders
is
clearly
decisive.
and
i
--
a
few
moments
ago,
scribbled
down
a
little
example
that
i
thought
might
illustrate
the
reason
i
think
so.
suppose
we
take
a
very
simple
state
and
assume
it
has
four
counties.
the
counties
are
equal
in
every
respect,
say
that
one
of
them
has
factories
whereas
the
others
are
pastoral.
each
county
has
40,000
people.
the
three
pastoral
counties
are
given
four
units
each
in
selecting
a
governor,
and
the
factory
county
is
given
one
unit
in
selecting
a
governor,
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
governor,
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
the
constituency
is
the
entire
state.
it
was
held
in
gray
and
sanders
that
that
was
impermissible.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
reason
that
that
is
impermissible
is
not
that
it's
a
government.
the
reason
that
it
is
impermissible
is
that
you
may
not,
in
giving
people,
in
waiting
votes
for
governor,
you
may
not
say
we
want
to
favor
the
pastoral
life.
we
want
to
encourage
the
pastoral
life
that
it
rests
on
the
proposition
that
in
this
area,
ours
is
a
society
that
does
not
permit
political
classes.
now
i
come
and
presume
that
we
have
exactly
the
same
figures
in
this
state
with
respect
to
the
number
of
senators,
four
for
each
of
the
three
pastoral
counties
and
one
for
the
factory
area.
and
in
other
words,
the
waiting
exactly
corresponds
to
that
of
governor.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
reason
that
was
applicable
in
the
governor
case
is
equally
applicable
in
the
senate
case.
it
is
this
that
i
had
in
mind
when
i
said
that
i
thought
to
that
extent
and
with
reference
only
to
that
extent
that
mr.
justice
harlan
was
right
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
baker
and
sanders
when
he
said
these
are
the
same
things.
if
you
are
going
to
admit
this
range
of
considerations
to
enter
into
the
rule
of
constitutional
determination,
i
see
no
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
choice
of
the
legislature
and
the
choice
of
the
governor.
it
seems
to
me
it's
just
as
irrelevant
as
it
is
the
attorney
general
argued
that
case
and
i'm
arguing
this
one,
or
that
that
case
came
from
georgia
and
this
present
one
comes
from
maryland,
or
the
same
thing
--
i
won't
go
through
all
the
figures
--
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
choice
of
the
assembly,
of
course.
now
where
the
difference
seems
to
me
to
come,
as
i
said,
i
think
the
case
is
dispositive
on
that
proposition
where
the
difference
seems
to
me
to
come
is
that
there
are
elements
that
may
enter
into
the
choice
of
a
legislature
which
by
hypothesis
don't
come
in
when
you're
selecting
one
man
for
a
single
constituency.
one
of
those
elements
may
be
that
i
think
i
suggested
before
that
you
may
have
an
island
off
the
coast.
this
was
a
case
with
nantucket
and
martha's
vineyard.
and
you
want
to
have
somebody
there
who
knows
something
about
the
needs
of
the
people
on
that
island
or
somebody
from
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
who
knows
something
about
it,
whereas
those
people
would
be
because
of
the
difficulties
of
communication,
transportation,
time
and
so
forth
largely
unrepresented
unless
you
brought
someone
in
to
the
extent
that
one
is
concerned
in
apportionment
with
that
kind
of
question,
there
i
would
agree
that
gray
and
sanders
is
not
logically
dispositive
and
i
take
it,
although
of
course
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
that
it
is
that
kind
of
difference
that
the
court
must
have
had
in
mind
when
it
said
that
the
one
case
didn't
decide
the
other.
i
don't
believe
it
was
saying
while
you
can't
create
preferred
political
classes
in
selecting
a
governor,
you
can
have
preferred
political
classes
in
selecting
a
legislature.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
completely
illogical
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
then,
i
do
and
the
difference
is
this,
justice
white
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
state
of
maryland
does
say
that
we
can
--
i
don't
think
there
is,
but
the
state
of
maryland
says
that
baltimore
is
unique
and
that
if
you
can
get
a
whole
lot
of
these
unique
factors
that
the
state
may
special
--
choose
to
give
them
a
special
advantage
over
the
suburban
path.
so
that
i
think
the
crazy
quilt
formula
and
the
point,
i'm
now
making
frequently
have
to
be
applied
like
two
halves
of
a
pair
of
shears
that
--
and
i
think
the
crazy
quilt
is
enough
for
this,
but
if
they
say,
"well,
baltimore
gets
more
representatives
to
favor
the
shipping
entry",
i
suppose
that
is
intelligible
or
rational
in
the
very
sense
that
i
have
to
deal
with
it
then
on
this
proposition.
that's
why
i
said
i
thought
this
came
into
play.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
the
house
in
maryland
is
--
let
me
take
it
as
i
go
along,
may
i?
it
will
fit
in
with
my
next
point.
i
said
the
maryland
legislature
was
unconstitutionally
apportioned
for
two
reasons.
our
second
reason
is
the
same
one
that
i
pressed
yesterday
in
connection
with
the
alabama
67
senator
amendment.
to
with,
that
the
apportionment
here,
even
though
it'd
be
supposed
to
be
based
on
rhyme
or
reason
and
to
be
based
on
the
desire
to
recognize
counties
and
geographical
problems
so
completely
sacrifices
a
notion
of
popular
will
or
majority
rule
and
create
such
gross
inequalities
that
it
is
a
violation.
it
is
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
it's
--
what
you're
trying
to
secure
is
utterly
inconsequential
in
terms
of
the
harm
it
does.
now,
at
that
point,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
it
becomes
pertinent
to
look
at
both
houses.
in
the
senate,
inequalities
run
as
high
as
50
to
one.
they
are
very
commonly
14
and
15
to
one.
in
the
house,
the
inequalities
run
as
high
as
five
to
one
if
my
memory
is
correct.
in
the
house,
there
are
eight
counties
with
four
times
the
population,
the
per
capita
representation
of
baltimore
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
in
fact,
they've
done
it
this
way.
they
--
although
they
give
arbitrary
numbers,
apparently
what
was
done
was
each
county
was
given
one,
then
the
risk
were
apportioned
regarding
to
population.
but
then
they
went
on
and
said,
"oh,
there
are
some
people
who
will
lose
representatives
and
we
can't
permit
that
to
happen,
so
we
will
give
everybody
at
least
the
representatives
he
had
before."
whether
this
meets
the
definition
of
an
intelligible
rule,
i
don't
know.
i
obviously
can't
state
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
every
county
does
have
one.
the
result
of
that
is
that
counties
with
only
36%
of
the
population
elect
the
majority
of
the
maryland
senate
--
of
the
maryland
house,
whereas
counties
with
only
14%
of
the
population
elect
the
majority
of
the
senate.
put
it
another
way
around,
it
might
take
as
many
as
54%
--
as
many
as
64%
of
the
people
of
maryland
to
get
a
bill
through
the
house
and
as
many
as
86%
to
get
a
bill
through
the
senate.
and
i
think
that
you
can't
simply
say
well,
the
urban
people
can
get
it
through
because
more
than
the
majority
are
urban
because
i
don't
think
their
interests
are
that
uniform.
so
here
we
think
that
whatever
figure,
and
i
want
to
make
a
claim
that
i
suggest
no
figure
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
unreasonable
minority
control
or
unreasonably
gross
inequality,
here
we
think
that
the
maryland
situation
in
both
houses
judging
them
together
is
so
--
so
submerges
the
principle
of
majority
rule
and
creates
such
gross
inequality
that
it
is
arbitrary
that
what
maryland
must
be
said
to
be
doing,
to
use
a
phrase
i
did
yesterday,
was
not
really
take
geography
into
account.
this
isn't
texas
or
california.
it's
a
little
state,
that
it
wasn't
really
taking
geography
into
account
but
was
creating
a
class
society,
a
class
political
society.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
think
he
did
because
he
made
one
point,
which
i'm
sure
we
would
be
in
agreement
on,
and
that
is
he
said
you
really
don't
have
to
consider
the
federal
analogy
here
because
neither
house
is
apportioned
in
accordance
with
the
population,
whereas
of
course
in
the
congress,
the
lower
house
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
--
if
he
did,
i
think
he
misspoke
himself
because
the
figure
is
that
as
counties
having
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
little
as
36%
of
the
population
can
elect
the
majority
of
the
house,
which
would
mean
that
it
might
take
as
much
as
64%
to
elect
a
majority
of
the
house.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
true.
that's
true
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
don't
think
he
would
dispute
that
for
a
minute
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
--
i
think
what
he
meant
by
that
was
that
even
if
the
popular
majority
was
able
to
control
the
senate,
still
this
little
14%
that's
been
elect
--
electing
was
able
to
control
the
house,
(inaudible)
myself,
that
this
--
this
little
14%
would
still
be
able
to
control
the
senate.
in
other
words,
people
who,
if
they
could
amass
54%
--
64%
of
the
house
could
get
a
bill
through
would
have
to
amass
86%
of
the
senate.
well,
you
might
be
able
to
do
one
without
the
other.
indeed
perhaps
it
not
infrequently
works
out
that
way
and
that's
what
would
result
in
the
deadlock.
i
think
the
only
differences
between
mr.
scanlan
and
myself
are
--
if
i
may
just
take
a
minute
to
explain
them
--
are
two,
mr.
justice
white.
one,
he
does
take
the
plunge
that
i
have
said
i
prefer
to
leave
it
to
the
future
and
say
that
the
constitution
requires
per
capita
equality,
substantial
per
capita
equality
in
both
houses
where
i've
said
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
he
does.
i
--
i
would
be
surprised.
the
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
there's
a
--
if
there's
a
difference
on
this,
i
submit
that
i'm
right
and
he's
wrong.
the
other
part
where
we
are
clearly
in
difference,
although
i
suspect
he
will
agree
with
me
now
that
he's
had
an
opportunity
to
reflect,
it's
of
course
true
--
it's
of
course
true
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
congress
has
power
to
lay
down
rules
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
making
an
unconstitutional
apportionment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
under
the
civil
act
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
would
emphasize
that
it
is
not
fair
--
it's
not
fair
in
a
sense,
accurate
in
my
judgment,
to
the
say
that
our
position
amounts
to
saying
that
the
congress
can
apportion
the
state
legislature
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
power
of
congress
went
only
to
deny
to
rules
that
would
prevent
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
and
that
equal
protection
does
not
provide
exactly
how
each
seat
in
a
state
assembly
or
senate
is
to
be
apportioned.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
would
think
so
indeed.
i
would
think
that
indeed
i
have
--
i
think
it's
been
implicit
in
everything
i've
said
that
the
court
should
decide
these
cases,
that
what
guidelines
there
are
should
emerge
from
deciding
the
minimum
required
in
each
of
these
cases
and
that
the
invitation
to
set
forth
general
abstract
rule
is
not
one
that
i'm
pressing
in
front
of
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
meant
only
to
state
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
congress
--
i
intended
only
to
put
in
other
words
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
says.
it
may
enact
--
may
enact
laws
that
are
necessary
and
proper
or
appropriate.
i
forget
what
the
phrase
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
by
appropriate
legislature
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
provisions
of
this
article.
now,
i
would
think
it
would
--
it
could
at
least
be
argued
that
to
set
out
an
exact
apportionment
for
each
of
the
50
states
doing
the
district
thing
and
assigning
the
number
of
seats
was
much
more
than
was
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
therefore
i
thought
it
was
misleading,
not
intentionally
so
but
unfortunate
to
suggest
that
recognizing
that
power
of
congress
was
to
recognize
that
this
congress
can
tell
the
states
how
to
apportion
themselves,
that
i
did
not
intend
to
express
any
opinion
on
how
much
you
can
do
beyond
the
bare
minimum
of
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires.
i
take
it
that
appropriate
legislation
leaves
congress
a
wide
degree
of
discretion
that's
perhaps
related
to
the
particular
subject
matter.
i
wasn't
trying
to
state.
i
apologize
for
being
so
long.
