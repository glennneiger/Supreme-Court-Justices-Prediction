justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
the
american
civil
liberties'
brief
was
filed
in
this
particular
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
separate
one
for
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
referring
to
the
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
state
of
maryland
could
decide
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
of
maryland
should
decide
baltimore
got
a
--
got
a
lot
of
compensating
advantages?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
didn't
need
a
representative
and
would
provide
a
senate
and
legislature
composed
of
people
from
everywhere
except
baltimore
county.
would
that
violate
its
constitutional
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
what
--
what
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
provision
would
you
say
it
violated
because
it
was
absurd?
there's
no
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
that
says
that
the
legislature
will
not
be
absurd
if
it
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
yes.
what
specific
provision
would
you
allow?
you
say
that
baltimore
--
the
county
of
baltimore
would
not
be
denied
its
federal
constitutional
rights
by
having
it
provided
that
the
laws
shall
be
made
by
a
representative
of
other
sections
of
the
state
leaving
baltimore
county
out.
what
provision
of
the
constitution
was
violated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
which
provision
would
you
find
that
in
if
you're
looking
for
a
specific
provision?
which
one
would
you
find
a
provision
if
the
state
shall
not
act
in
a
matter
that
this
court
considers
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
--
you
--
you
say
then
that
the
--
that
they
can't
deny
baltimore
complete
representation
under
the
constitution,
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
look
mainly
to
the
geographical
areas
rather
than
to
individual
to
do
the
voting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
that
large
area
outside
of
these
big
cities,
it
would
be
in
danger
if
you
let
these
individuals
who
live
in
the
big
cities
vote
for
as
many
representatives
as
the
ones
who
live
in
the
biggest
geographical
area.
justice
hugo
l.
black
close
geographically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
ones
to
be
there
more
--
more
human
beings
who
do
the
voting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
--
as
i
gathered
it,
it
maybe
sound
argument,
maybe
perfectly
right
but
your
argument
comes
down
to
exist.
people
in
the
city
of
baltimore
not
merely
because
they're
more
of
them
but
because
of
the
power
that
the
people
in
that
small
area
have
could
smoke
the
rest
of
the
state
to
have
a
much
smaller
population.
that's
--
seemingly
what
you
argue.
you
have
a
right
to
deprive
people
in
a
particular
area
of
their
full
right
of
suffrage
which
i
would
think
that
is,
as
far
as
representation
is
concerned,
that
full
right
of
suffrage
because
you
want
to
strip
them
of
some
of
their
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
arguments
are
not
new,
they
were
made
in
the
original
constitutional
convention
in
connection
with
electing
congressmen
by
the
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than
by
a
limited
number
of
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
arguments
are
very
similar
to
those.
but
--
well
if
it
may
not
be
of
importance,
--
what
was
on
those
debates,
they
certainly
referred
to
right
of
the
individuals
to
vote
is
one
of
the
fundamental
article
in
a
republican
type
of
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
consider
it
that,
wouldn't
you?
the
right
of
suffrage
--
by
the
people,
all
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
using
it
in
the
debates
there,
when
there
was
an
effort
made
to
limit,
an
effort
made
to
do
one
or
two
things.
one
was
to
deprive
the
people
of
the
right
to
vote
for
their
congressmen
at
all.
the
other
one
was
to
limit
the
vote
to
freeholders
who
own
land
and
who
might
have
that
were
suggested
in
the
bench
the
other
day
the
pass
through
a
viewpoint.
and
both
of
those
were
voted
down,
the
--
the
original
and
the
original
constitution
has
specifically
voted
down
the
idea
that
it
is
best
to
have
your
elections
in
such
a
way
that
the
people
who
own
land
and
farms
could
eliminate
the
others
from
unequal
consideration
and
having
their
votes
counted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
a
reference
to
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
the
senate,
they
considered
they
had
it
right
between
them
as
to
whether
you
have
a
confederation
of
states,
each
group
which
had
one
or
whether
you
would
have
one
government.
it
almost
failed,
the
chance
to
have
a
constitution
almost
founded
on
that
point
but
the
--
the
ground
on
which
the
senate
was
given
an
equal
number
of
votes
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
had
to
be
done
to
get
a
compromise
or
is
it,
they
should
be
treated
as
though
each
one
them
was
an
individual
in
having
their
votes
counted
on
the
senate
floor,
that
was
the
basis
there
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
except
for
that,
except
by
some
who
--
who
did
not
believe
on
other
people's
vote.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
you
could
take
away
part
of
the
votes
for
some
where
they
had
an
election
in
order
to
give
others
more
power
to
run
the
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
made
--
their
arguments
been
made
here
by
taxing.
one
man
said
that,
if
the
man's
going
to
have
a
right
of
suffrage,
is
fundamental
and
if
the
--
the
man
who
is
to
pay
taxes
is
denied
the
privilege
of
voting
for
the
people
who
levies
and
collects
the
tax,
he
will
not
be
living
in
a
free
country.
that
was
the
line
of
argument
that
was
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
can't
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
in
is
whether
whatever
may
be
the
force
of
the
argument,
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
possibly
say
that
the
counties
or
district
within
a
state
are
to
be
treated
on
the
basis,
that
there
somehow
in
the
situation
that
the
original
13th
congress
were
by
each
one,
must
be
given
an
individual
vote
to
protect
the
individual
states
from
the
overpowering
influence
of
some
of
the
other
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
that
can
be
said
about
the
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
think
you
presented
your
case
very
well
indeed
if
i
may
say
so.
