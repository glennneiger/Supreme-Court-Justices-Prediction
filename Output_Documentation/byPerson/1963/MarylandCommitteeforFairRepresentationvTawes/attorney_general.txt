mr.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
following
in
the
wake
of
the
bevy
of
appeals
and
cross-appeals
of
the
alabama
reapportion,
the
litigation
as
produced,
i
feel
constrained
to
say
with
respect
to
the
maryland
case,
is
just
one
single
set
of
appellants
and
one
single
set
of
appellee.
i
think
by
learning
(inaudible),
the
attorney
general,
the
assistant
attorney
general
would
agree
on
that
proposition,
i
believe.
i
want
to
say
this
though,
although
i
wasn't
always
able
to
identify
the
appellants
or
the
appellees,
or
the
cross-appellee
or
the
cross-appellants
in
the
alabama
case,
i
did
find
in
the
remarks
that
some
of
their
attorney,
principally
mr.
morgan,
mr.
band
and
especially
mr.
mcconnell,
a
statement
of
the
views
that
we
think
are
controlling
for
the
maryland
case
and
indeed
for
all
the
cases
now
to
bar
this
court.
i
especially
thought
that
mr.
mcconnell
in
his
response
to
the
inquiry
put
to
him
by
justice
harlan
concerning
the
controlling
force
of
the
--
of
gray
versus
sanders,
he
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
thought
that
case
to
control
the
alabama
case
and
the
other
reapportion
cases
now
being
considered
by
this
court.
but
it
did
say,
i
believe,
and
certainly
i
agree
with
him,
that
the
principal
enunciated
there
should
be
determinative
of
the
litigation
now
before
this
court.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
the
court
disclaimed
the
consequences
saying
in
that
case
that
they
were
ruling
on
the
principles
involved
in
the
reapportioned
cases,
(inaudible)
of
course
the
court
decided
only
the
litigation
in
the
case
of
controversy
before
it,
but
i
say
in
the
principle
that
was
enunciated
in
gray
v.
sanders
when
applied
to
the
reapportionment
case,
and
the
maryland
case,
and
the
other
cases
before
the
bar,
in
the
end
should
be
controlled.
before
i
plunge
into
that
argument,
i
think
in
view
of
the
rather
long
course
of
this
litigation
has
taken
in
reaching
this
court,
perhaps
it's
your
procedural
history
of
it
that
might
be
helpful.
i
think
the
two
questions
presented
in
our
view
are
one.
the
question
of
whether
the
residents,
the
eligible
voters,
the
taxpayers,
of
the
five
most
popular
subdivisions
of
maryland
are
being
denied
at
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
a
result
of
the
representation
now
accorded
in
the
maryland
state
senate.
the
second
question
that
i
think
is
presented
here
is
whether
those
same
voters
residing
in
those
same
areas
are
being
denied
equal
protection
as
a
result
of
their
representation
in
the
general
assembly
considered
as
a
whole
body.
the
case
began
with
a
bill
of
complaint
filed
by
taxpayers
and
citizens
of
those
five
most
popular
subdivisions,
and
they
are
the
counties
of
anne
arundel,
baltimore
county,
prince
george's
county,
montgomery
and
the
city
of
baltimore.
the
defendants,
of
course,
were
the
election
officials
of
state
who
would
be
called
upon
to
put
in
operation
the
mechanism
that
governed
the
election
for
senators
and
members
of
our
house
of
delegates.
the
bill
of
complaint
sought
basically
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
alleging
that
the
representation
provided
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house
of
delegates
and
in
the
general
assembly
as
a
whole,
have
violated
certain
provisions
of
the
state
constitution
and
certain
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution,
mainly
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
these
state
issues
are
no
longer
in
the
case.
the
court
below
in
effect
decided
those
against
this,
and
all
pertinent
rulings
of
the
court
below,
both
in
the
prior
case
and
the
case
that
is
now
appealed
here,
rests
on
federal
grounds
fourteenth
amendment
decisions.
there
originally
was
a
demurrer,
of
course,
in
this
bill
of
complaint
of
baker
v.
carr
had
not
yet
to
come
down,
and
it
was
still
thought
by
the
chancellor
that
colegrove
v.
green
was
determinative.
after
the
demurrer
was
sustained,
we
appealed
in
the
fall
of
1961.
the
case
was
argued
and
then
on
the
initiative
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
was
reargued.
we
suspect
that
at
that
time,
i
know
we
were
never
able
to
establish
it,
that
they
were
marking
time
while
waiting
for
this
court
until
it
handed
down
its
capital
decision
in
baker
v.
carr.
and
when
this
court
did
that
within
a
short
month
thereafter,
our
court,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
in
a
decision
report
within
180
a.
2d
656
followed
them,
the
opinion
of
this
court
entailed
that
we
had
studied
the
course
of
action
with
respect
to
the
malapportionment
that
existed
in
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
at
that
time
and
sent
it
back
to
the
chancellor,
judge
duckett,
for
a
determination
whether
there
was
such
a
reasonable
relation
to
population
or
unreasonable
relation
to
population
in
both
houses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
did
or
did
no
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
was
a
further
hearing
before
the
chancellor
--
not
an
evidentiary
hearing.
actually,
all
the
exhibits
were
stipulated.
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
there
were
really
no
contested
issues
of
fact
anywhere
along
the
line.
on
may
the
24th,
he
did
hand
down
a
decision
in
which
he
struck
down
the
house
of
delegate
representation
as
it
then
stood
on
may
the
24th,
1962.
and
within
24
hours,
a
special
session
had
begun.
after
five
days
of
the
special
session,
we
had
added
19
new
delegates
to
the
house
of
delegates,
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
addition
was
pursuant
to
know
a
statutory
formula.
if
you
will
notice
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
set
forth
the
statute
--
the
actual
bill
as
it
went
through
legislature
and
we
did
that
not
to
run
out
printing
expenses
at
the
behalf
--
in
behalf
of
our
clients,
but
to
show
how
a
formula
was
originally
set
out
in
the
bill
and
then
at
the
11th
hour
was
crossed
out
and
the
19
new
delegates
were
just
given
on
a
basis
of
a
--
two
individual
counties,
montgomery
county
has
got
a
four
more,
prince
george
has
got
four
more,
anne
arundel
got
one
more,
one
of
the
legislative
districts
of
the
city
of
baltimore
got
two,
and
another
got
one,
and
for
baltimore
county,
the
largest
county
got
seven.
now,
the
chancellor,
meanwhile,
in
his
original
decision
tried
not
to
pass
on
the
senate
issue
but
we
promptly
appealed
that
the
same
day
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
very
shortly
thereafter
they
directed
the
--
the
chancellor
to
decide
that
issue.
and
when
we
went
back
to
those
federal
argument,
he
decided
it,
decided
against
this
holding
on
the
basis
of
the
so
called
federal
analogy
that
there
was
history
in
maryland's
past
as
to
support
as
a
reasonable
basis
of
representation.
we
took
an
appeal
of
that
decision
also
the
same
day
it
was
handed
down.
and
very
shortly
thereafter
on
july
the
23rd,
1962,
it
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
recurring
the
opinion
was
issued
in
the
afternoon
before
the
three
decision.
and
in
september,
the
written
opinions
were
handed
down
of
judge
brune
writing
the
dissenting
opinion
adjoined
in
by
judge
prescott
and
judge
(inaudible).
the
basic
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
again
with
the
federal
analogy,
maryland's
history,
the
existence
of
counties
for
a
long
time,
their
alleged
importance
and
the
scheme
of
government
of
maryland
towards
the
rational
basis
to
justify
a
finding
that
it
was
not
offensive
--
the
representation
in
the
senate
was
not
offensive
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
said
that
the
issue
of
the
house
reapportionment
was
not
before
them
and
technically
that
was
correct,
but
i
think
in
view
of
some
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
appellees
and
also
endorsed
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
and
as
amicus
curiae
brief,
i
would
like
to
make
a
very
clear
what
we
believe
the
procedural
situation
is.
as
to
the
senate
issue,
there
is
no
doubt
that
is
clearly
before
this
court.
after
the
house
issue,
after
the
special
reapportionment,
we
abandoned
the
claim
that
the
house
--
qua-house
was
reapportioned
in
the
manner
the
defendant
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
we
never
abandon
and
have
pursuit
from
the
beginning
as
our
bill
of
complaint
showed
the
fair
argument
--
the
argument
that
the
legislature
considered
as
a
whole
does
not
provide
the
representation
that
the
--
what
the
minimum
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
but
we
might
as
well
--
i
think
i
might
have
to
clarify
it
now.
no,
the
house
now
is
a
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
house
of
delegates,
the
house
of
delegates.
the
house
of
delegates
has
143
members,
79
of
these,
which
is
55%,
come
from
the
five
most
popular
subdivisions
that
i
have
been
referring
to.
formally,
before
the
special
session
and
the
stop-gap
legislation,
they
had
only
60.
they
only
had
--
had
60,
that
was
an
increased
of
19.
formally,
the
largest
subdivisions
had
49%
of
the
representation
in
the
house.
now,
they
have
55%
of
the
representation
of
the
house,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it
was
done
pursuant
to
know
statutory
formula.
in
effect,
it
held
everybody
at
the
level
they
were
on
may
the
25th,
1962,
that
gave
19
more
and
distributed
it
in
the
manner
that
i
had
mentioned
before.
finally,
i
think
it's
important
to
mention
that
this
stop-gap
legislation
which
took
care
of
the
house
of
delegates
only
expires
by
its
own
terms
on
january
the
1st,
1966.
if
it
is
not
superseded
by
a
constitutional
amendment,
it's
an
interesting
question
of
what
if
--
what
if
it
goes
back
to
the
chancellor
having
struck
down
what
preceded
it
and
what
it
existed
for
almost
100
years.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
would
be,
but
the
law
says
that
if
it
isn't
succeeded
by
a
constitutional
amendment
by
1966,
it
expires
by
its
own
terms
and
representation
then
reverse
to
the
status
it
was
on
the
day
judge
duckett
struck
it
down
after
nearly
two
years
ago.
now,
the
pertinent
facts
of
these,
the
population
fact
show
that
about
now
maryland
has
3,300,000
people,
or
maybe
a
little
more
the
time
of
1960
census
it
had
about
the
3,100,000
people
and
about
70%
--
6%
of
these
people
live
in
these
five
most
popular
subdivisions
that
we've
been
talking
about,
and
these
subdivisions
of
course
have
been
characterized
for
the
most
part,
except
baltimore
city,
by
a
phenomenal
grow
especially
even
before
the
war,
but
especially
since
the
war
in
the
last
20
years
the
counties
of
montgomery
and
prince
george's
and
anne
arundel
and
all
of
the
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes.
the
--
in
the
senate,
it
is
one
senator
for
each
county,
except
the
city
of
baltimore.
it's
divided
into
six
legislative
districts.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
house
of
delegates
is
based
on
county.
in
other
words,
in
19
--
in
1950,
we
grows
into
the
constitution
the
representation
that
the
counties
had
on
the
basis
of
the
1940
census.
for
instance,
north
chester
county
with
23,000
--
maybe
i'm
a
little
low
there,
maybe
28,000
people,
has
formed
hartford
county.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
every
delegate
runs
within
the
county.
we
do
not
have
legislative
or
election
districts
with
the
single
exception
of
the
city
of
baltimore.
there,
you'll
have
one
senator
for
each
one
of
the
legislative
districts
and
it
used
to
be
six
delegates
for
each
one
of
the
legislative
districts
in
the
city
of
baltimore.
now,
one
has
two
more
and
another
has
one.
now
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
come
--
they
tell
us
baltimore
is
unique
and
i
find
it
a
proposition
that
--
that
it's
quite
irrefutable.
i
know
that
--
but
i
know
many
baltimoreans
and
they
agree
it's
unique.
some
people
tell
me
it's
a
seaport
but
i
don't
think
--
annapolis
is
landlocked.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
over
the
generations
with
the
struggle
for
political
power
in
maryland,
the
forces
of
baltimore
while
usually
at
a
great
disadvantage
when
matched
against
their
country
cousin,
nevertheless
on
occasion
could
summon
up
some
strength,
and
those
occasions
occurred
three
times
in
the
history
of
our
state.
the
first
occasion
was
i
believe
in
19
--
1864.
at
that
time,
maryland
was
really
under
the
yolk
of
the
union
army.
it
was
a
state
thorn
of
thunder.
and
at
that
time,
the
more
--
the
pro-federalist
forces
met
and
had
a
convention
and
gave
baltimore
finally
two
more
senators
and
created
their
free
legislative
district,
each
senator
having
one
and
each
district
having
the
same
number
of
re
--
representative
as
the
law
of
the
county.
this
was
confirmed
by
the
convention
of
1867
and
it
was
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
some
attempts
in
the
convention
to
prep
them
back
that
the
feeling
was
that
baltimore's
views
were
pro
quo
slavery
at
that
time
and
it
might
be
just
as
well
have
--
have
them
have
a
few
votes.
so
they
didn't
prep
them
back.
now
in
1900,
again,
there
was
an
addition
of
a
senator.
it's
very
hard
to
say
how
that
came
about
the
--
the
meager
legislative
history
we
have
is
called
from
the
pages
of
the
baltimore
sun,
it
seems
that
they
had
a
fairly
strong
mayor
and
the
political
situation
in
many
event
produced
another
additional
senator
and
another
legislative
district
to
the
city
of
baltimore.
finally
in
1922,
when
by
happy
coincidence
we
had
one
of
the
greatest
and
strongest
governors
of
maryland,
albert
ritchie
who
was
a
baltimorean
and
in
concert
with
the
terrific
journalistic
attack
led
by
h.l
mencken
of
the
baltimore
sun
and
the
day-after-day
barrage
about
the
unfairness
of
the
situation,
baltimore
again
was
able
to
get
two
more
senators
and
two
more
legislative
district
which
is
what
they
have
today,
except
the
slight
addition
in
1962
of
few
more
delegates.
but
i
want
to
emphasize,
the
only
reason
they've
got
it
was
the
--
the
arguments
made
for
them
to
get
it
was
their
population,
not
because
they're
a
seaport.
as
a
matter
fact,
with
the
--
the
--
their
uniqueness
was
the
point
argued
against
them.
it
was
said
that
they
really
didn't
need
this
representation
event
though
they
were
entitled
to
it
by
their
population
because
they
were
so
unique.
they
were
like
business
--
it
was
the
business
center
of
maryland,
the
commercial
center,
and
the
--
the
comment
was
often
made,
“baltimore
can
get
anything
it
wants
out
of
the
legislature,
and
therefore
you
don't
need
the
representation.”
but
it
was
only
because
of
their
population
that
they
got
this
additional
representation.
now,
the
--
the
--
the
representation
as
i
said
before
is
one
senator
for
each
of
the
--
the
county,
and
one
senator
for
each
of
the
legislative
districts.
we
have
23
counties
and
six
legislative
districts
which
makes
29
senators.
now,
under
the
present
system,
76%
population
with
the
maryland
population
elects
only
34%
of
the
senate.
on
the
other
hand,
24%
of
the
population
can
elect
66%,
more
than
enough
for
a
constitutional
amendment.
now,
four
counties
living
aside
baltimore
city
hall
just
like
four
so-called
suburban
county
like
some
of
my
adversaries
sometimes
content
--
contentiously
refer
to
as
the
“bedroom
county”.
they
have
45%,
perhaps
more
today
maybe
46%
to
47%
of
population
of
the
state,
but
they
only
have
14%
of
the
representation
of
the
state
senate
and
these
--
but
these
inequities
not
just
less
populous
area
versus
the
--
i
see
the
light
is
on,
it's
recess
time.
