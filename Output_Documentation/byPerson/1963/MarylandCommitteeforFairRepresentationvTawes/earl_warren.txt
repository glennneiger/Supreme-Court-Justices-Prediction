et

appellants,
versus

et

mr.
scanlan,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
according
to
formula
or
is
that
according
to
the
--
just
the
manner
the
legislature
choose
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
isn't
required
by
your
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is,
yes.
that's
what
i
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
speaking
for
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
scanlan.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
answered
the
questions,
so
alright.
mr.
bourbon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
the
rationale
of
that
apportionment
in
the
city
of
baltimore?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
--
i
understand
that,
but
why
in
one
--
in
one
district
would
the
legislature
put
83,000
people
and
then
another
one
225
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
something
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
thought
they
readjust
it
two
years
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
those
two
that
they
gave
them
two
years
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
the
--
could
the
legislature
anymore
discriminate
within
in
--
as
to
districts
within
the
city
of
baltimore
than
it
could
throughout
the
state
as
far
as
representation
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
they'll
say
that
is
to
all
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
so
far
as
equal
protection
or
the
law
is
concerned,
is
there
any
difference
between
malapportionments
of
districts
within
the
city
of
baltimore
than
within
the
--
the
state
of
maryland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
that's
what
i
want
you
to
point
out,
if
you
can.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is
this.
in
a
--
in
a
city
like
baltimore,
you
have
a
--
a
big
shipping
industry
in
one
part
of
the
city.
you
have
a
--
a
big
industrial
area
in
another
part
of
the
city.
you
have
a
big
residence
district
in
still
another
part.
now,
would
it
be
possible
for
the
--
for
your
legislature
to
wait
--
wait
those
districts
and
say,
"well,
in
the
city,
we
think
that
the
downtown
business
area
is
more
important
than
the
--
than
the
residence
district,
so
we'll
--
we'll
give
them
greater
representation
down
there
than
in
the
residence
district
or
that
we
would
do
the
same
thing
with
the
--
with
the
shipping
industry"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i
--
we're
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
here.
could
they
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
in
the
city
--
could
they
do
that
in
the
city
of
--
of
baltimore
any
more
than
they
could
do
it
throughout
the
state
where
we're
talking
about
suburbanites
and
ruralites
and
urbanites
and
so
forth?
is
--
is
there
any
differentiation
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
situation
would
hold
true
you
think
between
city
and
state
even
in
situations
like
you
have
in
--
in
baltimore
as
between
the
city
of
baltimore
and
the
county
of
baltimore
which
adjoins
it
and
which
is
actually
a
part
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bourbon,
under
our
system,
isn't
it
one
thing
for
the
state
to
diffuse
its
power
through
the
representation
of
its
people
provided
that
representation
is
fair,
where
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
government
to
diffuse
its
power
if
the
ones
who
are
diffusing
that
power
had
not
been
fairly
represented.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
in
other
words,
if
your
legislature
is
fairly
a
representative
of
all
--
all
the
people,
there's
no
question
about
that
and
they
want
to
diffuse
their
power
in
some
way,
that's
representative
government.
but
assume
you
start
with
the
premise
that
your
--
that
your
legislature
is
not
fairly
chosen
according
to
representative
principles,
cannot
then
diffuse
its
power
and
divest
any
part
of
your
people
of
any
power
that
they
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
was
--
i
was
merely
hypothesizing
and
trying
to
differentiate
between
the
situation
where
the
power
was
diffused
under
fair
representation
and
the
diffusion
of
power
where
it
wasn't
fair.
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
say
that
you're
--
you're
unfair
in
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
representation.
i'm
merely
asking
if
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
how
the
state
does
it,
whether
they
do
it
after
or
through
fair
representation
or
whether
they
do
it
through
unfair
representation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
think
you
have,
except
this.
now,
assume
--
take
the
other
one
(inaudible)
and
assume
that
--
that
they
are
not
fairly
represented,
then
would
the
--
would
the
same
action
of
the
legislature
be
justifiable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
why
not
go
on
a
little
farther
than
that
(inaudible)
and
--
and
take
this
that
might
be
--
might
be
a
practical
situation.
suppose
the
state
of
maryland
said,
"we're
--
we're
going
to
divide
our
house
exactly
as
we
divide
our
senate."
and
it
proceeded
to
do
so
and
we
found
that
under
that
situation,
14%
in
each
house
could
determine
the
laws.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bourbon,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bourbon,
may
i
ask
you
this.
is
there
any
political
remedy
for
malapportionment
in
maryland
other
than
through
the
legislature
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
was
the
last
time
they
called
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
has
--
is
the
question
never
been
submitted
to
the
people
before
first,
since
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
control
--
what
control
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
number
that
voted
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i'm
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
there
--
one
there
one
in
1930
also,
the
vote
of
people
on
that
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
they
voted
for
it
clearly
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
legislature
has
declined
ever
since
they
had
a
constitutional
convention?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
they
just
--
the
people's
vote
doesn't
amount
to
anything
in
that
situation
if
a
malapportioned
legislature
doesn't
--
doesn't
choose,
assuming
that
it
is.
if
it
doesn't
choose
to
call
the
election,
there
is
no
remedy
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
about
the
remedy
because
in
some
states,
like
california,
they
have
both
the
initiative
and
the
referendum.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
has
in
california,
for
instance,
it
has
been
exercised
in
this
very
area,
three
or
four
times
since
the
--
since
their
constitutional
amendment
of
one
senator
to
one
county
has
been
in
existence.
in
fact,
two
years
ago,
they
had
a
--
they
had
a
measure
on
there
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
people
did
have
a
remedy
and
i
want
to
know
if
in
maryland
you
had
somewhat
akin
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
--
mr.
botter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
ahead,
just
go
and
finish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
number
69
--
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
scanlan,
i
have
overlooked
your
--
your
rebuttal,
sorry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
you
may.
