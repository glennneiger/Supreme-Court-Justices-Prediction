mr.
theodore
i.
botter
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
the
14
other
states
who
joined
on
our
brief
as
friends
of
the
court.
i
hope
to
use
a
short
amount
of
time
that
we
were
great
--
we
were
graciously
given
by
the
state
of
maryland
to
endeavor
to
analyze
the
problem
and
find
some
solutions
and
standards
so
as
to
help
preserve
not
only
the
form
of
government
chosen
by
the
state
of
maryland,
but
the
forms
of
government
chosen
by
the
15
states
who
have
appeared
here
as
friends
of
the
court
as
well
as
many
other
states
in
the
country.
state
governments
usually
conform
to
three
general
categories,
one,
in
which
a
population
is
used
as
the
basic
or
primary
standard
in
one
house
and
pure
political
subdivisions
are
used
as
the
basis
for
apportionment
in
a
second
house.
the
second
category
is
where
you
have
a
population
standard
in
one
house
and
districts
used
in
the
second
house
by
combining
or
dividing
political
subdivisions
or
using
other
areas.
examples
of
the
first
category
are
new
jersey,
arizona
and
idaho
which
use
counties
and
vermont
which
uses
--
it
uses
towns.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
new
jersey
uses
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
21
counties.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
60
assemblymen.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
there
are
actually
only
five
slightly
under
populated
counties
which
are
overrepresented.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
there
are
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
well,
actually
in
the
equal
proportions
method,
although
they
start
with
that
formula,
you'll
find
that
all
of
the
counties
bear
a
very
substantial
relationship
in
terms
of
population
and
that
it
does
take
practically
50%
to
elect
a
majority
in
the
house.
you
start
with
the
large
counties,
it
takes
counties
with
51%
of
the
population
to
get
31
votes
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
in
the
senate
--
in
the
senate,
yes.
in
the
second
category
of
the
states,
you
have
illinois,
louisiana,
hawaii
and
california.
the
third
category
of
states
have
population
as
the
basis
of
apportionment
in
both
houses,
alabama,
indiana,
oklahoma
are
examples.
but
alabama
and
indiana
by
constitutional
amendments
that
have
been
proposed
are
trying
to
move
into
the
first
category.
now,
we
setup
these
categories
or
i
might
say
that
maryland,
we
consider
a
variant
in
the
first
category
where
the
only
discrepancy
in
the
senate
is
that
baltimore,
the
city
of
baltimore
is
given
especial
treatment
otherwise
it
is
population
basically
in
one
house
and
counties
in
another.
we
setup
these
categories
because
we
feel
that
in
answering
the
validity
and
the
seeking
standards
for
determining
the
validity
of
the
first
category,
it
will
make
answers
to
the
remainder
very
simple.
actually,
there's
no
problem
with
the
third
category,
both
houses
are
on
a
population
basis.
the
second
category
has
some
special
problems
because
you
are
sometimes
or
rather
artificially
dividing
or
combining
counties.
but
the
first
category
presents
the
greatest
disparities
in
per
capita
population
in
one
house.
in
new
jersey,
it's
20
to
1,
smallest
to
the
largest
counties
with
19%
controlling.
and
in
vermont,
it
goes
up
to
900
or
over
900
to
1
because
one
town
only
has
38
people
and
one
other
town
has
over
34,000
in
vermont
and
it
only
takes
11%
to
control
the
vermont
senate.
now,
can
we
justify
the
first
category?
in
looking
for
standards,
we
feel
that
the
first
place
to
look
is
the
guaranty
clause.
it's
amazing
that
there's
been
so
much
argument
in
these
cases
for
three
days
and
solicitor
general
cox
has
never
once
mentioned
the
guaranty
clause,
mr.
(inaudible)
of
alabama
was
kind
enough
to
admit
that
he
thought
there
was
some
--
might
be
some
standards
there
and
we
think,
it's
the
most
appropriate
clause
to
start
with.
it
deals
directly
with
this
problem.
if
you
read
the
clause,
it
tells
us
something
about
our
problem.
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
in
this
union,
a
republican
form
of
government.
now,
we
have
to
ask
what
is
a
permissible
republican
form
of
government?
what
does
the
clause
mean?
well
we
start
with
its
language.
we
think
it
means
what
it
says.
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
government.
now,
we
know
from
the
debates
in
the
constitutional
convention
of
1787,
it
meant
at
least
that
a
state
could
not
adopt
a
monarchy
because
they
said,
if
one
state
did
it,
others
might
and
then
the
whole
union
will
be
jeopardized.
but
we
think
there
is
a
little
bit
more
meaning
to
be
gleamed
from
the
debates
because
madison
proposed
that
the
cause
read
slightly
differently.
he
said
that,
the
constitutions
of
each
state
and
the
existing
laws
of
each
state
should
be
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
and
i
think
it
was,
i'm
not
sure,
it
might
have
been
wilson
of
pennsylvania
who
suggested
the
final
form
of
the
language
but
i
don't
there
was
any
meaning
or
change
of
intent
and
if
we
look
at
what
madison
said
in
the
federalist
no.
42,
it
bears
out
what
he
said
during
the
debates.
the
existing
constitutions
or
the
existing
forms
of
government
the
states
had
were
to
be
guaranteed
and
any
state
can
--
could
choose
another
republican
form
and
claim
for
the
guarantee
of
this
constitutional
provision.
now,
we'll
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment.
we
also
think
there's
room
for
play
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
it
has
application
to
this
problem.
we
think
that
the
two
clauses
should
be
juxtaposed
in
this
fashion.
that
the
guaranty
clause
we
say,
guarantees
a
state
to
choose
a
form
of
government.
it
maybe
category
one,
population
of
one
house
areal
or
rather
political
subdivision,
bases
in
another
house,
it
maybe
category
three,
if
a
state
likes
though
some
have
chosen,
they
can
select
population
as
the
base
of
apportionment
in
both
houses.
in
making
this
choice
of
a
form
of
government,
we
think
the
states
have
complete
sovereignty
and
complete
discretion.
now,
in
the
application
or
implementation
of
the
form
of
government,
we
would
say,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
application.
in
other
words,
when
a
state
says,
we're
going
to
choose
a
county
form
or
political
subdivision
basis
in
one
house,
it
must
be
not
invidious
in
the
application
of
that
form
and
in
that
respect,
it
answers
mr.
justice
black's
question
but
if
a
state
says
by
its
constitution
or
by
its
practice,
that
every
county
shall
get
one
vote,
it
couldn't
say,
cape
may
county
is
to
be
excluded
because
it's
too
far
south,
we
don't
like
them
there.
some
of
them
are
below
the
mason
dixon
line.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
except
to
this
extent,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
application
of
federal
standards,
federal
constitutional
standards,
as
in
the
nashville
case
where
the
court
has
said,
the
state
can
choose
--
the
state
in
practice
can
do
anything
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
a
state
has
chosen
its
constitution,
a
population
standard
for
both
houses,
would
reflect
on
the
rationality
of
any
departure
but
i
would
also
say
that
it
was
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
no,
there's
a
difference,
if
the
first
category
is
constitutionally
permissible
under
federal
standards,
then
a
state
that
applied
the
first
category
wven
though
it's
constitutional,
its
state
constitution
says
it
should,
would
not
violate
federal
standards.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
i
would
say
that
if
--
if
one
house
is
well
apportioned
and
another
house
ignored
population
despite
the
state's
own
constitution,
but
chose
to
apportion
the
second
house
in
a
form
that
is
constitutionally
--
federally
constitutionally
permissible
that
this
court
would
not
intervene
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
and
to
put
“no,
we
don't
enforce
state
constitutional
rights.”
so
that's
so
long
as
the
state
in
practice,
did
not
go
beyond
the
federal
constitutional
standards,
it
would
be
all
right.
in
the
nashville
case,
you
had
a
question
of
discriminatory
taxation.
the
state
constitution
said,
all
property;
real
property,
should
be
assessed
equally
but
they
treated
railroads
unequally
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
writing
the
opinion,
said,
that
doesn't
violate
a
federal
right.
there
are
in
other
examples
of
how
the
implementation
would
have
to
comply
with
the
guaranty
clause.
you
couldn't
arbitrarily
for
example,
take
three
little
--
take
10
men
and
make
counties
out
of
them
in
an
unreal
fashion
and
give
them
votes
because
this
would
not
be
part
of
our
concept
--
fundamental
concept
of
representative
government
or
you
could
form
some
form
of
government
if
you
choose,
that
would
fit
into
the
four
circles
drawn
by
solicitor
general
cox
and
probably
ask
for
the
protection
of
the
guaranty
clause
for
that
form
of
government.
i'd
say
it
might
be
a
different
form.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
i
don't
know
if
that
--
that's
happened
in
any
state
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
i
would
prefer
to
deal
with
it.
i
think
the
court
with
deal
with
it
when
it
--
when
it
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
it
has
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
overpopulated
counties.
i
don't
think
so.
in
my
opinion,
first
of
all,
it
is
an
extreme
case.
i
don't
know
what
one
should
do
with
really
extreme
cases.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
in
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
it
--
it
--
it
might
be
unreasonable.
it
might
be
so
extreme
as
to
be
unreasonable
because
it
departed
from
some
sent
--
fundamental
concept
of
a
representative
government.
it
would
be
unreal
and
unrealistic
to
have
a
county
compose
of
10
people
wielding
an
extreme
amount
of
power
proportionally
in
the
legislature.
but
i
would
--
i
would
prefer
to
deal
with
vermont,
for
example
which
has
a
ratio
of
over
900
to
1,
and
i
think
when
you
get
in
to
specific
cases,
you
can
find
rationality
before
it.
vermont
has
246
towns
represented
in
one
house.
the
senate
is
well-apportioned
on
a
population
basis.
now,
of
the
246
towns,
a
small
--
half
of
them,
only
represent
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
of
vermont.
but
over
200
towns
--
225
towns
to
be
exact
in
vermont
have
less
than
4,000
population
per
town.
and
so,
in
effect,
they
have
a
rule
of
majority
of
towns
voting
and
there
is
a
unanimity
or
--
or
some
general
conformity
of
interest.
and
they
don't
find
this
bad.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
vermont
came
into
the
union
in
1791
with
a
unicameral
legislature
with
50
to
1
ratios
and
it
was
admitted
to
the
union,
no
one
thought
that
was
bad,
22%
of
the
population
ruled
the
one
house
that
made
all
the
legislation
for
vermont
but
it
was
admitted
to
the
union.
and
they
didn't
have
a
senate
until
1830.
and
in
1830,
no
one
knew
the
formula
of
equal
proportions,
no
one
knew
too
much
about
mathematical
equality
and
proportionate
representation.
so
i
say,
that
at
least
historically,
you
can
support
vermont,
and
if
you
support
vermont,
you
can
support
almost
any
of
the
other
states
that
take
the
category
one
form
of
government
and
i
--
yes.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
no,
it
came
in
1791
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
it
was
the
14th
state,
yes
sir.
now,
incidentally,
in
terms
of
look
--
supporting
our
view
that
you
look
to
the
14th
--
to
the
guaranty
clause,
there's
an
excellent
article
by
professor
jerold
israel
in
61
michigan
law
review,
135
--
at
135,
which
holds
the
same
thing.
that's
the
place
you'd
look
when
you're
looking
for
standards
in
the
first
instance.
now,
you
also
look
to
baker
v.
carr
and
there
i
find
a
lot
of
justices
agreed
that
there
was
room
for
play,
room
for
waiting
and
even
in
the
majority
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
only
invidious
discrimination
that's
to
be
struck
down.
only
no
policy,
only
--
a
form
that
has
no
rationality
and
we
say,
there
is
rationality
for
the
forms
of
the
government
we
choose.
now,
the
real
question
that
we
have
tried
to
address
ourselves
principally
to
the
brief,
in
the
brief
is
this,
must
majority
rule
be
the
standard
for
two
houses
in
the
legislature?
we
say,
no.
almost
all
of
those
on
the
other
side
say,
yes,
but
we
don't
know
where
they
get
it
from.
mr.
cox
said
in
his
brief,
that
it
was
--
it
was
the
delegates
to
the
federal
constitutional
convention
were
in
general
agreement
that
the
standard,
whatever
they
had
for
the
federal
government,
the
standard
for
the
states
is
population
for
both
houses
of
legislature.i
don't
find
that
in
the
constitutional
debates
at
all.
in
fact,
i
find
quite
the
contrary.
governor
randolph
in
his
introduction
of
the
resolutions
that
became
the
basis
for
our
federal
constitution
said,
but
we
must
guard
against
ma
--
majority,
the
excesses
of
democracy.
he
said,
we
thought
we
had
a
strong
senate
in
virginia
but
we
found
it
wasn't
strong
enough
and
maryland
too.
i
think
he
said,
found
their
senate
was
just
a
phantom
and
new
york
and
massachusetts
too.
even
madison
who
proposed
proportionate
representation
for
both
of
the
federal
houses
of
legislature,
say
that
the
same
time
and
he
repeated
this
in
the
federalist
no.
10.
he
said
that
the
same
time,
there
is
a
difference
between
democracy
and
republican
government
and
in
for
--
using
representative
forms
of
government,
we
must
divide
our
society
into
so
many
parts
that
the
majority
--
the
major
faction
will
have
difficulty
in
uniting
and
having
their
way
to
the
exclusion
of
the
will
of
the
minority.
so
we
find
no
unanimity
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
like
to
quote
mr.
chie
--
mr.
gorham
of
massachusetts
who
expressly
said,
"there
is
a
need
to
protect
minority
groups
from
oppression
by
the
majority,"
and
he
said,
"this
remark
was
applicable
not
only
to
states
but
to
counties
or
other
districts
of
the
same
state."
and
incidentally,
we
draw
some
comfort
in
using
the
federal
analogy
from
this
language,
it's
at
page
29
of
our
brief.
more
recently,
woodrow
wilson
said,
"the
senate,
the
federal
senate,
says
as
often
from
headlong
popular
attorney."
our
view
is
that
an
intentional
check
upon
the
majority
rule
in
both
houses
is
a
rational
objective
of
state
bicameral
government.
forms
of
representative
government,
commonly
and
historically
employed
by
the
states
should
serve
as
a
guide
to
what
is
permissible.
we
refer
to
vermont,
arizona
came
in
after
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1912
with
two
senators
per
county
and

united
states
commerce
specifically
said
in
their
act
of
admission,
they
comply
with
the
federal
constitution,
their
constitutions
did
and
interestingly
enough
in
1962
for
current
acceptance
of
this
thesis,
the
voters
in
colorado
rejected
a
referendum
which
would
have
provided
proportionate
representation
in
both
houses
and
every
county
in
the
state
including
the
central
areas,
the
east
--
eastern
slopes
which
have
a
--
the
largest
portion
of
population
in
colorado,
even
they
voted
against
equal
representation,
proportioned
at
the
population
of
both
houses
and
the
public
selected
a
principle
which
falls
into
our
second
category.
in
new
jersey
of
course,
we've
had
this
form
of
government
since
1776.
before
the
federal
government
had
it,
we
think
it's
good.
in
illinois,
recently
was
upheld
the
1954
amendment
to
the
illinois
constitution
where
the
court
said,
"the
apportionment
was
on
an
arbitrary,
clearly
political
compromised
motivated
area
of
basis
and
upheld
it."
why?
because
they
said,
"cook
county
and
chicago
can
rule
one
house
but
we
don't
think
illinois
has
to
accept
their
rule
in
both
houses,"
and
they
had
an
--
an
area
principle
to
protect
the
downstate
counties.
i'd
like
to
--
my
time
is
running
out.
i'd
like
to
say
that
equal
protection
means
more
than
mathematical
equality,
it
also
means
protection.
our
argument
is
that
majority
rule
in
both
houses,
does
not
afford
adequate
protection
or
minority
interest.
the
majority
has
the
one
house
that
usually
elects
the
senate
or
the
governor.
it
usually
elects
highway
commissioners
who
decide
where
highways
had
to
go
and
we
think
that
the
minority
in
one
branch
of
the
legislative
government
should
have
some
bargaining
power.
we
also
think
that
there's
some
rejection
of
minority
rule
as
of
--
as
a
governing
principle
in
the
federal
constitution
itself.
for
example,
if
there's
a
tie
in
the
vote
for
the
president,
it
goes
into
the
house
of
representatives
with
each
state
having
just
one
vote,
so
the
population
doesn't
rule
there.
my
time
is
up
and
i'd
like
to
say
in
conclusion
as
we
did
in
our
brief
that
it's
not
irrational
for
a
wagon
driver
when
urging
his
horse
down
a
hill
to
keep
one
hand
on
the
break
and
that's
what
we
think
this
form
of
government
does
that
we're
espousing.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
we
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes.
mr.
justice
white,
i
know
that
question
would
come.
it
happen
to
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
we
we're
on
our
brief
on
the
assumption
that
if
you
had
one
house
that's
good,
you
could
have
wide
discrepancies
in
another
house.
we
did
because
all
the
states
who
joined
our
brief
after
we
wrote
it
incidentally,
happened
to
have
a
house
that's
either
constitutionally
required
to
be
apportioned
that
way
or
it's
actually
apportioned
that
way.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
so
it's
satisfies
the
people
that
i
represent
for
the
moment
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
there
is
as
to
can
--
you
can
find
historical
support
for
that
proposition
that
you
advanced.
and
in
saying
that
we
should
accept
historically
acceptable
forms
of
government
if
one
state
thinks
at
the
right
time,
that
kind
of
a
light,
i
think
we
have
to
accept
somewhat
this
corollary
to
our
rule
but
i
don't
find
perfect
historical
support
for
it.
vermont
is
a
--
is
a
real
exception.
there
was
only
one
--
a
one
house
legislature
with
minority
control.
the
same,
you
can
argue
that
it
was
majority
of
town's
control.
there're
a
lot
of
little
towns
in
the
first
legislature
of
vermont.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
yes.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
we're
satisfied,
we
would
be
satisfied
with
that
rule
and
i
think
there
is
historical
support
for
it
in
the
constitutional
convention
itself.
almost
all
the
delegates
were
in
agreement
that
the
house
of
representatives
should
be
apportioned
on
a
population
basis.
there
was
hardly
any
fight
about
that.
later
on,
madison
started
saying
when
the
going
got
rough,
well
at
least
one
house
ought
to
follow
this
principle
when
he
couldn't
--
couldn't
assert
the
principle
for
both
houses.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
no.
if
you
go
back
to
the
republican,
--
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
--
if
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
theodore
i.
botter
i
think
there
was
some
qualifications.
i
think
that
in
--
as
i
said,
if
you
go
to
the
guaranty
clause,
it's
not
too
much
to
work
with
because
we
don't
know
--
they
didn't
say
too
much
about
the
clause.
we
know
that
a
monarchy
is
no
good.
and
we
also
know
that
that
it
means
that
these
forms
of
government
that
the
states
had
in
1787
were
probably
good
and
most
of
them
were
--
had
at
least
one
house
based
on
population
or
popular
basis.
11
of
the
13
colonies
had
bicameral
legislatures,
and
most
--
and
--
and
a
--
in
all
--
in
seven
of
those,
you
had
only
one
house
based
on
a
non-population
standard.
so
that
you
have
historical
support
for
the
proposition
that
not
only
is
it
acceptable,
but
it
is
probably
what
the
founders
intended
to
protect.
now,
whether
a
state
should
be
able
to
set
up
a
system
of
minority
rule
in
both
houses,
i
think
there
is
room
for
this
court
to
interpret
that
guaranty
clause
to
determine
whether
that's
the
kind
of
representative
government
that
is
protected.
and
if
it's
not,
then
it
would
be
--
we'd
be
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
use
the
equal
protection
clause
to
cut
it
down
if
it
felt
that
this
denied
equal
protection
or
was
invidiously
discriminatory.
but
in
doing
so,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
there
is
wide
latitude,
you
just
can't
--
you
just
can't
take
heads
and
--
and
align
them
all
up
and
--
and
come
to
result.
there
has
to
be
some
play
even
in
both
houses.
thank
you
very
much.
