mr.

mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
an
appeal
or
a
putative
appeal
of
a
criminal
defendant
whom,
through
some
type
of
error
or
negligence,
did
not
get
his
notice
of
appeal
filed
within
10
calendar
days
after
the
judgments
of
conviction
was
pronounced
in
open
court.
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
pronounced
on
april
24
after
2
o'clock
pm
in
the
afternoon.
the
written
judgment
and
commitment
was
signed
and
was
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
same
day.
that
day,
a
postcard
was
sent
to
counsel's
office,
my
office.
we
have
a
notation
on
that
judgment
which
is
in
the
original
record.
the
notation
however,
not
being
transcribed
by
the
printer
of
the
record
that
it
was
docketed
as
a
judgment
the
following
day,
april
25th,
which
was
a
thursday.
that
docketing
relates
only
to
the
civil
aspects
of
this
judgment.
it
--
providing
for
a
fine
as
well
as
a
prison
term
and
the
docketing
which
was
done
the
next
day
in
the
civil
judgment
docket
was
on
a
thursday.
we
do
concede
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
criminal
appeal
here
rather
than
the
civil
appeal.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
was
a
fine
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
well,
that
was
because
it
was
in
the
civil
judgment
docket.
it
was
a
criminal
judgment,
your
honor.
there's
no
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
all
of
the
judgment
was
entered
in
the
file
of
the
criminal
docket
against
this
defendant
on
--
on
or
as
of
april
24.
on
april
25th,
it
was
entered
in
the
docket
of
civil
judgments
as
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
of
america
against
the
defendant
for
$10,000
or
for
the
amount
that
he
was
fined
herein.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
appears
in
the
original
record
here,
your
honor.
now,
if
that
docketing
has
a
judgment
on
april
25th
could
be
considered
effective,
then
the
10
days
from
that
would
have
expired
on
the
sunday
and
by
the
provisions
of
the
roof
of
a
computation
of
time
would
carry
over
to
the
following
monday.
this
is
one
--
one
point
that
can
be
noted
from
that
notation
on
--
on
the
docket.
and
that
is
stamped
by
a
rubberstamp
on
the
original
judgment
and
commitment
dated
april
24th.
and
i
have
checked
the
docket
of
the
u.s.
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
and
in
that
docket
book
of
money
judgments,
that
notation
appears
under
the
date
of
april
25th,
the
following
date.
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
well
it
would
seem
that
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
--
from
the
weight
of
authority
of
this
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
from
the
weight
of
authority
of
this
court
and
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
we
would
have
doubts
as
to
whether
we
could
rely
upon
the
april
25th
docketing
of
the
fine
as
giving
us
a
right
to
appeal.
the
whole
doctrine
of
authority
and
of
this
court
in
the
past,
has
considered
the
sentencing
in
open
court
to
be
the
principle
point.
however,
this
is
a
factor
that
enters
into
this
case
that
may
distinguish
it
from
other
cases
that
there
was
a
separate
docketing
of
this
case
as
a
civil
judgment
the
following
day.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
because
the
--
the
docketing
--
if
the
metaphysical
concept
of
entry
of
judgment
is
to
be
considered,
the
actual
entry
into
the
clerk's
docket
as
of
the
time
when
the
clock
starts
to
run,
then
it
may
well
be
that
if
the
government
or
the
court
chooses
to
enter
the
judgment
as
a
money
judgment
as
well
as
a
criminal
judgment
that
the
fact
that
this
is
effective
the
following
day,
at
least
gives
him
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
money
fine
or
the
judgment
insofar
as
it
is
a
money
fine.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
i
--
i
have
no
authority,
your
honor
--
i
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
--
that
is
an
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
i
would
like
to
withdraw
that.
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
inspection
--
inspecting
books
and
the
docket
that
was
entered
into
was
a
docket
of
civil
judgments
for
money.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
principle
point
is
if
this
appeal
is
to
be
considered
as
a
--
a
matter
of
limitation
upon
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
file
his
notice
of
appeal
as
it
has
been
found
in
previous
cases
that
the
defendant
ought
to
be
accorded,
every
benefit
of
any
possible
doubt
of
interpretation
of
the
rule
in
as
much
as
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
appeal
to
the
extent
that
it
is
to
be
considered
as
a
right
by
this
court,
deserves
protection.
the
defendant's
rights
herein
concern
some
constitutional
points,
points
that
may
not
have
been
appreciated
too
well
by
counsel
that
urged
these
points
upon
the
trial
court
or
by
the
trial
court
itself
that
decided
the
points.
the
point
of
course
being
the
claim
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
contraband
at
premises
where
the
defendant
had
desks
space
that
he
rented
from
an
overall
lessee
of
the
premises
was
to
be
considered,
he
stops
from
raising
an
objection
to
the
search
and
seizure
on
the
ground
that
his
landlord
who
was
the
overall
tenant
of
the
premises
had
consented.
it
was
upon
this
ground
that
the
trial
court
finally
denied
the
motion
of
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court
to
suppress
all
evidence
that
was
raised
and
seized
upon
that
search
including
an
alleged
statement
that
was
given
by
the
petitioner
to
the
arresting
officers
after
the
contraband
was
found.
on
monday
of
this
week,
this
court,
in
stoner
against
california,
indicated
in
very
strong
terms
that
a
person
having
legitimate
claim
to
protection
of
his
right
against
search
and
seizure
has
standing
an
interest
to
complain
of
it
regardless
of
who
else
may
have
consented
to
the
search.
this
decision
certainly
was
presaged
by
this
court's
decision
in
jones
against
united
states
and
in
chapman
against
united
states
as
well
as
the
earlier
case
of
mcdonald
against
united
states
in
1948,
which
--
although
it
is
not
cited
in
my
brief,
i
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
this
is
--
this
is
a
--
another
problem
that
this
court
really
must
consider
because
the
last
case
where
the
principle
point
was
raised,
united
states
against
robinson,
this
court
indicated
that
where
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
were
at
stake,
he
would
always
have
the
right
to
have
a
collateral
attack
brought
against
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
the
infringement
of
his
constitutional
rights
vitiated
it.
this
is
a
statement
in
united
states
against
robinson
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
this
is
not
a
collateral
attack,
your
honor.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
and
certiorari
upon
a
direct
appeal.
however
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
the
second
appeal
herein,
as
you
may
recall
from
the
record
after
the
first
appeal
was
dismissed,
the
--
a
petitioner
brought
a
proceeding
under
rule
35
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
the
district
court
to
modify
and
correct
his
sentence.
this
motion
was
granted
by
the
trial
court
and
judgments
denoted
as
an
amended
judgment
and
commitment
was
entered
on
june
10,
1963.
the
defendant
petitioner
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
the
next
day
from
that
and
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
there
is
an
indication
in
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
there
is
an
indication
in
the
earlier
berman
case
which
of
course
has
no
relation
to
this
particular
petitioner,
in
1937
where
that
particular
procedure
was
attempted
to
be
followed
by
the
petitioner
in
that
case
who
thought
that
his
appeal
was
in
jeopardy
of
being
dismissed
and
hoped
that
he
could
revive
it
by
making
such
a
motion
in
the
lower
court
which
motion
was
granted
and
a
relief
sought
therein
was
granted.
this
court,
in
that
case,
held
that
the
first
appeal
was
still
a
valid
appeal
and
decided
that
first
appeal
on
the
merits
and
held
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
sentence
the
man.
that
question
was
really
left
open
in
the
berman
case.
there
is
a
circuit
court
opinion
cited
in
my
brief,
bridges
against
united
states
wherein
the
circuit
court,
in
reviewing
a
petitioners
--
an
appellant's
claim
of
invalidity
upon
a
remote
collateral
attack
upon
a
judgment,
held
that
the
failure
of
that
appellant
to
have
made
an
appeal
when
the
court
sua
sponte
had
entered
a
corrected
judgment
months
subsequent
to
the
original
judgment
of
conviction
was
thereafter
precluded
or
at
least
prejudiced
by
his
failure
to
have
appealed
from
that
corrected
judgment.
from
the
indications
in
these
cases,
it
is
apparent
to
petitioner
that
where
--
not
only
the
petitioner
asks
that
the
judgment
be
corrected
by
any
reason
but
where
the
court
sees
fit
to
grant
that
application
and
thus
enter
an
amended
judgment
thereon.
and
it
is
noted
in
the
record
on
appeal
herein
that
in
the
oral
argument
that
preceded
the
entry
of
this
corrected
judgment,
that
the
history
of
the
dismissal
of
this
appeal
and
the
desire
of
the
petitioner
to
appeal
claimed
errors
of
the
original
conviction,
was
urged
before
the
trial
court.
and
the
trial
court
in
its
colloquy
or
pronouncements
to
counsel
took
note
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
desired
to
have
such
an
appeal.
it
is
submitted
by
petitioner
that
if
that
second
judgment
did
not
open
up
the
petitioner's
right
to
appeal
from
the
original
conviction
--
it's
--
in
its
entirety
that
the
effect
of
that
second
appeal
should
at
least
be
considered
equivalent
to
a
collateral
attack
upon
that
judgment
rather
than
to
burden
the
petitioner
appellant
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
make
a
motion
under
section
2255
of
--
i
believe,
title
18
to
set
--
assign
the
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
by
the
use
of
illegally
seized
evidence
that
where
he
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
the
remedy
of
2255,
i
have
doubts
about
even
that
your
honor.
all
of
these
things
are
doubtful
to
me.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
if
it
is
available,
it
would
seem
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
to
consider
on
a
direct
appeal
that
which
could
be
treated
upon
a
collateral
attack.
there
must
be
some
effective
meaning
to
the
statement
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
robinson,
that
where
there
is
an
error
of
constitutional
degree
that
the
defendant
is
not
barred
and
precluded
by
the
fact
that
the
10-day
rule
may
serve
to
preclude
his
direct
appeal
because
in
such
an
injustice,
this
court
has
said,
“the
aggrieved
defendant
can
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
collateral
relief.”
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
well
it
would
seem
contrary,
your
honor.
it
would
seem
that
--
that
the
fay
against
noia
case
would
indicate
that
it
is
a
constitutional
--
i'm
sorry,
a
jurisdictional
matter
to
have
this.
but
it
--
what
--
we
really
are
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
to
file
your
appeal
within
the
10-day
period
be
it
as
it
may.
it
is
our
contention
that
in
as
much
as
the
10-day
rule
is
a
rule
and
not
a
statute,
that
the
rule
is
subject
to
interpretation
to
a
greater
degree
than
a
statute
could
be
interpreted,
and
that
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
i
would
certainly
urge
that
point
upon
this
court
and
any
court
where
any
type
of
grave
constitutional
error
occurs,
it
would
seem
that
it
is
within
the
province
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
entertain
a
claim
which
a
defendant
maybe
able
to
substantiate,
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
infringed
either
by
a
coerced
confession
or
by
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
or
by
any
other
infringement
of
any
constitutional
right
of
a
petitioner.
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
well
--
we'll
--
we
--
we'll
we
have
to
concede
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
to
the
extent
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
well,
it's
there.
the
decision
is
on
the
record
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
that
should
be
applied
herein.
we
still
have
the
matter
that
the
court
was
open
only
three
hours
on
a
saturday.
the
sentence
was
admittedly
pronounced
in
the
afternoon.
there
--
if
the
defendant
is
to
have
the
benefit
of
10
full
days,
should
that
be
precluded
by
the
fact
that
the
time
was
not
a
full
10
days
but
even
a
half
hour
or
an
hour
or
less
than
10
full
days.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
a
separate
point.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
there
is
one
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
two
separate
facets
of
my
argument.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
may
add
a
fourth
that
where
the
procedural
steps
are
taken
to
put
a
case
into
an
appeal
court
where
there
is
a
narrower
constitutional
degree
that
is
involved
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
it.
perhaps
contrary-wise
to
the
prior
rulings
of
this
court
as
has
been
mentioned
by
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
i
don't
have
that
in
front
of
me,
your
honor,
the
robinson
case,
the
type
of
case
that
was
involved.
that
appeared
to
be
one
only
on
the
calendar
and
the
issue
there
seemed
to
be
confined
to
a
matter
of
calendar.
it
is
--
i
--
i'm
unable
to
answer
that
question.
but,
it
would
seem
that
if
there
were
any
grave
constitutional
issues
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
possible
to
determine
that
from
the
record
in
that
case.
and
i
regret
that
i'm
unable
to
answer
that
question
of
the
court.
it
would
seem
in
conclusion
that
regardless
of
how
a
petitioner's
right
of
appeal
may
expire
a
normal
cause
that
if
he
is
able
to
demonstrate
some
constitutional
error
involved
in
the
original
proceeding
in
the
trial
and
the
trial
court
therein
is
willing
to
enter
a
corrected
and
amended
judgment
even
though
under
rule
35
on
a
purely
technical
point
of
reduction
of
sentences.
the
fact
that
a
judgment
is
entered
and
it
is
a
judgment
and
a
criminal
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
his
right
to
appeal
therefrom,
even
the
ordinary
right
of
appeal
should
be
permitted
to
the
extent
of
at
least
the
constitutional
questions
that
were
involved
in
the
original
conviction.
it
--
it
seems
that
this
is
what
the
court
--
the
circuit
court
in
bridges
against
united
states
meant
when
it
discarded
the
appellant's
later
collateral
attack
when
he
hadn't
made
no
direct
appeal
from
the
corrected
judgment
that
was
entered
by
that
court.
and
it
would
seem
that
whenever
any
judgment
is
entered
in
the
criminal
docket
in
that
particular
case,
if
the
defendant
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
has
been
aggrieved
by
constitutional
errors
that
have
contributed
to
that
judgment.
it
would
seem
that
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
appeal
to
the
extent
of
urging
those
constitutional
errors.
mr.

there
is
none,
your
honor.
that
is
entirely
my
own
responsibility.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
because
i
left
that
office
at
3
o'clock
that
afternoon
and
went
home.
and
i
had
been
instructed
personally
to
file
it,
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
taken
care
of
other
personnel
in
the
office.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
afternoon,
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
didn't.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that's
right,
i
let
it
go.
i
was
a
new
york
lawyer
and
i
had
not
been
completely
apprised
of
the
interpretation
and
meaning
and
very
terrible
consequences
of
the
10
days
and
what
the
meaning
was
and
i
followed
our
usual
new
york
practice
which
is
if
time
expires
on
a
saturday,
you
can
do
it
on
a
monday
morning.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
immediately
after
the
first
appeal
was
dismissed.
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
first
appeal
was
made
on
or
about
the
same
day
that
it
was
filed
which
was
that
following
monday,
may
6.
on
may
6,
the
appeal
was
filed
and
immediately,
the
united
states
attorney
moved
to
dismiss
it.
for
the
purpose
of
that
motion,
the
court
of
appeals
considered
that
it
had
jurisdiction
at
least
to
decide
to
dismiss
that
appeal.
at
that
point,
immediately,
we
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
moved
to
amend
the
sentence
under
rule
35.
and
as
soon
as
the
judgment
was
entered,
we
appealed
then.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
the
court
did
entertain
that
jurisdiction.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
folios
640
through
646
of
the
printed
transcript
of
record
in
which
the
consideration
of
the
defendant's
desire
to
again
appeal
was
raised
orally
upon
the
return
of
the
motion
and
was
discussed
between
the
court
and
counsel
for
both
sides
to
eliminate
any
doubt
as
to
that
particular
point.
we
did
not
get
it
into
the
motion
papers.the
motion
was
a
several
pronged
motion.
there
were
other
problems
affecting
the
defendant,
namely
the
prospect
of
immediate
surrender
which
would
have
involved
losses
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
his
creditors
and
to
his
family.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
pages
83
and
84.
if
i
may
just
have
a
word,
it
is
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
it
is
our
contention
that
with
the
second
appeal,
that
in
as
much
as
it
is
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
the
defendant
contending
that
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
was
an
element
that
entered
into
judgment
even
though
it
was
a
reduced
sentence
and
a
reduced
fine.
still,
it
was
a
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
defendant
complains
of
constitutional
error
that
entered
to
it
and
therefore,
he
should
be
permitted
to
at
least
raise
the
point
of
constitutional
error
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
--
in
the
opinion.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
it
--
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
it
permits
us
to
raise
the
point
on
one
proceeding,
the
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
to
have
to
go
down
stairs
all
the
way
again
and
start
going
up.
mr.
bernard
b.
polak
that
is
the
only
difference,
a
matter
of
judicial
economy.
