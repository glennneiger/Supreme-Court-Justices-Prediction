justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
other
argument
is
that
the
actual
entry
of
the
fine
under
the
judgment
record,
however
that
was
done
as
justice
goldberg
just
discussed
with
you,
on
the
25th,
starts
--
the
time
running
from
the
25th
so
again,
you're
filing
another
suit
here
on
may
6
for
the
time,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
third
--
and
your
third
deals
with
the
--
the
disposition
of
the
rule
35
motion,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
forgotten,
was
robinson,
was
that
a
constitutional
claim?
in
robinson,
i
forgot
the
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gilinsky,
do
you
--
do
you
recall,
i
noticed
the
opinion
doesn't
indicate,
what
were
the
merits
of
robinson's
claim,
were
they
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
there
is
that
it
was
appealed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
a
murder
case
in
which
he
got
a
manslaughter
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
know
what
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
mr.
gilinsky,
if
that
should
happen,
then
i
take
it
--
and
the
government
interposed
--
well,
he
didn't
take
an
appeal,
then,
the
(inaudible)
problem
would
arise,
wouldn't
it,
this
2255,
whether
or
not
he's
fairly
to
take
an
appeal,
denies
them
as
it
would
not,
perhaps,
in
a
review
of
the
state
proceeding
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
the
review
of
this
constitutional
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
you
never
attempted
to
face
the
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
--
and
i
gather
your
argument,
do
you
suggest
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
we
didn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
rule
35
has
been
treated
as
a
2255
to
whatever
happens
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
when
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
he
didn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
difference,
isn't
it?
