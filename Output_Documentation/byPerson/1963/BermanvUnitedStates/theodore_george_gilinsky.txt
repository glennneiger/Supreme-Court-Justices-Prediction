mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit
to
review
two
separate
dismissals
and
presents
basically
two
questions.
the
first
question
is,
when
the
last
day
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
is
a
saturday,
whether
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
on
monday
will
suffice
because
of
--
of
a
number
of
reasons
either
at
the
new
york
--
certain
courts
in
new
york
have
a
practice
where
they
exclude
saturday
or
because
the
clerk's
office
--
the
federal
clerk's
office
in
new
york
was
open
only
half
a
day
on
saturday.
the
second
appeal
which
was
dismissed
presents
the
second
question
which
in
substance
is
whether
an
appeal
maybe
revived
after
the
time
--
the
10-day
period
has
expired
by
a
nominal
reduction
in
a
sentence.
in
other
words,
may
the
district
judge
deliberately
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal
from
10
days
to
--
such
as
this
case,
a
period
of
a
month
and
a
half?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
could
have
reduced
it
to
zero.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
on
the
--
the
rule
does
not
provide
for
vacation,
your
honor.
the
rule
provides
that
he
may
reduce
a
sentence
within
60
days
of
the
sentence
or
it
may
be
reduced
60
days
after
its
return
from
the
court
of
appeals
or
60
days
after
this
court
would
deny
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that
he
can
do
any
time.
that
60
days
--
if
it's
an
illegal
sentence,
60
days
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
he
can
do
that
--
any
judge
can
eliminate
an
illegal
sentence
on
a
motion
at
anytime
and
that's
the
first
sentence
of
rule
35.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
you
and
i
are
talking
about
the
same
thing.
we
say
vacate
but
i
would
--
i
would
say
this,
i
think
a
judge
has
the
power
within
this
60-day
period,
which
measure
from
different
spaces,
to
reduce
a
sentence
to
zero.
now,
that
may
be
a
vacation
and
put
a
man
on
probation,
let's
say,
or
something
like
that.
there's
no
--
there's
no
indication
in
the
rule
that
would
forbid.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
this
is
part
of
the
purpose
of
the
rule
that
the
judge
can
have
a
second
thought
so
to
speak
on
the
extent
but
it
was
limited
deliberately
as
to
time
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
old
practice
was
that
they
would
extend
the
term
to
hold
it
over
the
head
of
the
defendant
and
the
idea
was
to
get
rid
of
this
and
to
allow
the
district
judge
only
60
days
within
which
to
do
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
it
could
be
done
in
those
terms.
there
--
there
is
a
way
it
could
be
done.
i
mean
this
isn't
a
problem
of
rules.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
something
--
for
instance,
there
is
no
question
that
on
the
collateral
attack,
which
can
be
entered
at
anytime
in
this
--
in
the
course
of
a
--
a
proceeding,
that
if
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
which
have
raised
the
judge
has
a
right
to
vacate
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
once
that's
done,
i
would
assume,
although
i
think
it
--
it
would
take
some
peculiar
and
unique
circumstances
to
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
be
surprised
to
find
a
judge
merely
entering
a
judgment
of
acquittal
except
in
the
case
where
the
indictment,
let's
say,
was
absolutely
invalid
and
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
and
so
that
what
you
would
get
to
eventually
is
that
what
--
what's
happening
in
this
kind
of
a
case
is
that
they
got
an
illegal
--
illegal
sentence
so
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
get
to
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
as
i
say
i
think
that
there
are
ways
that
this
can
be
done.
i
don't
have
any
question.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
have
no
question
about
its
jurisdiction
to
do
it
if
it's
properly
presented
to
him
and
i
--
there's
no
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
that
we've
ever
questioned
this
one.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
don't
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
you
and
i
--
what
--
i'm
not
certain
what
you
mean
when
you
say
a
mistake.
if
you
mean
that
a
--
a
judge
has
looked
at
either
the
sentence
has
decided
that
this
man
--
well,
we're
talking
about
two
things,
i
think.
the
problem
of
sentence,
that
is
whether
a
man
should
be
punished
for
a
crime
is
--
is
something
that
is
separate
apart
from
whether
or
not
he
is
guilty
even.
and
--
and
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i'm
not
sure
but
i
think
it
would
arise
in
the
same
type
of
--
i
--
i
know
of
no
case
like
this
but
i
think
that
what
you
are
talking
about
could
arise
in
a
type
of
proceeding
that
gives
a
judge
jurisdiction
power
to
grant
a
new
trial.
and
in
that
circumstance
--
i
mean
after
all,
once
you
granted
a
new
trial,
you
start
fresh
and
--
and
then
i
go
back
to
my
example
of
an
invalid
indictment
or
for
any
reason
the
judge
enters
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
now,
the
government
may
be
very
unhappy
that
we
haven't
had
a
chance
to
even
prove
it
nor
we're
--
we're
suddenly
thrown
out.
we
have
no
right
to
appeal
and
so
forth
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
district
judge
has
power
in
certain
circumstance.
whether
or
not
in
all
circumstances,
i
think
would
be
questionable
because
i
think
it
depend
on
the
facts.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
--
well,
i
don't
--
i
can't
imagine,
first
of
all,
any
judge
just
doing
it
for
no
reason.
once
you
get
to
some
reasons,
you
see,
you
find
ways
to
do
this.in
other
words,
if
there
is
an
indictment
that's
invalid,
i
can
find
reason
but
i
mean
if
--
if
you
just
have
a
whim,
this
is
difficult
for
me
to
--
to
work
with.
in
any
event,
they
--
the
--
the
second
issue
presented
by
the
second
appeal
in
this
case
really
comes
down
to
whether
the
district
judge
can
purposely
enlarge
the
period
from
10
days
to,
as
in
this
case,
approximately
a
month
and
a
half.
at
the
outset,
i
think
i
should
make
the
--
the
government's
position
clear
about
two
matters.
one
is
the
rules.
we
do
not
say
that
the
rule
should
not
be
changed
or
that
this
rule
is
the
best
rule
that
could
be
devised
and
certainly,
the
rules
committee
have
these
rules
under
consideration
and
that's
why
they're
rules
so
that
they'd
be
--
can
be
continually
looked
at
in
view
of
our
experience
and
possibly
some
changes
made.
the
second
thing
is
that
we
feel
that
in
1960,
when
this
court
decided
united
states
versus
robinson,
that
to
a
great
extent,
the
excuses
that
are
now
offered
in
this
case
are
of
no
different
caliber
or
no
different
substance
than
the
excuses
that
we're
offered
in
robinson
and
at
that
time,
it
was
decided
that
the
period
for
appeal
cannot
be
enlarged,
where
the
failure
to
take
the
appeal
was
due
to
the
neglect
of
counsel
even
though
it
was
excusable
neglect
of
the
counsel.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
were
no
merits
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
case,
your
honor,
because
it
arose
on
a
notice
of
appeal.
no
one
ever
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
--
you
see,
one
of
the
things
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
was
--
it
was
a
manslaughter
case
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
what
he
would
have
raised.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
you
see
about
petitioner's
new
suggestion
of
--
of
collateral
attack.
you
see,
what
really
happens
on
a
notice
of
appeal
is
that
they're
just
a
paper
file.
there's
no
--
one
of
the
things
we
got
away
from
in
the
rules
was
the
--
the
idea
of
setting
forth
why
a
person
has
to
take
an
appeal,
setting
out
the
reasons
and
so
forth.
so
that
all
that
the
petitioner
has
to
file
is
a
paper
saying,
"i
want
to
take
an
appeal."
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
have
to
present
any
issues.
so
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
most
cases
is
merely
a
notice
of
appeal
saying,
"i
want
to
take
an
appeal."
they
get
the
docket
entries
from
below
and
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
the
timeliness
of
the
--
of
taking
the
appeal,
so
that
the
question
of
the
real
issues
which
may
or
may
not
be
involved
in
some
case
are
never
really
truly
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
an
appellate
procedure.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
have
to
make
two
assumptions
but
i
would
say
yes.
but
i'd
like
to
explain.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
explain.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
well,
i
was
going
to
explain
your
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
maybe
the
--
the
rule
should
be
changed
so
that
everybody
has
to
take
appeals
within
10
days
whether
they
got
a
lawyer
or
not.
and
--
and
in
other
words,
if
you
--
if
you
stand
before
the
bench
and
you
have
no
lawyer
and
you
--
and
you
are
sentenced.
the
judge
then
is
required
to
ask
you,
"do
you
want
to
take
an
appeal?"
and
if
you
say
yes
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
he
tells
the
clerk.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
think
it's
--
well,
yes
and
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
we're
--
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing.
we're
talking
about
a
constitutional
question.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
we'd
have
to
--
well,
it's
not
as
plausible
--
possible
but
it
--
it's
--
it's
not
--
i
mean,
i
suppose
in
any
--
any
time
you
say
you
have
a
search
and
seizure
case,
you
have
a
constitutional
question.
i
mean
if
you
want
to
take
this
broad
view,
you
--
you
have
a
question.
but
if
you
go
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
don't
believe
you
have
a
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
no,
i
don't
--
not
only
lose.
i
don't
think
that
--
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
--
comes
even
close
to
being
the
kind
of
fundamental
error
that
the
court
would
consider
even
on
a
collateral
attack.
but
as
i
say,
you
have
to
get
to
the
facts
on
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
you
--
you
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
pose
the
question
--
you
pose
the
question
of
a
--
of
a
clear
violation
of
a
constitution.
i
would
assume
if
you
have
a
clear
violation,
yes,
you
can
always
attack.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
2255
in
title
28
says
that
you
can
raise
--
it
says
in
so
many
words,
constitutional
issue.
i
mean,
we
can't
--
i
can't
argue
that
--
against
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind.
there's
never
been
any
doubt
in
the
government's
mind
in
our
brief
that
we
--
we
suggest
--
we'd
said
this
that
if
that
--
there
are
a
number
of
remedies
for
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
we've
had
--
we've
had
the
problem
of
people
who
have
not
taken
appeals
where
constitutional
issues
are
involved.
actually,
i
--
i
think
the
answer
gets
down
to
this
that
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you've
taken
an
appeal
even.
if
you
really
have
--
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
if
you
really
have
the
issue
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that
--
regardless
of
--
if
you
--
even
if
you'd
taken
an
appeal,
you
could
still
go
back,
that's
what
i'm
saying
and
even
if
it
hadn't
been
raised
on
appeal.
so
certainly,
if
--
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
question
of
whether
the
appeal
was
denied
certainly
can't
change
this
status.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
i
will.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
i
--
well,
this
--
this
is
a
civil
lien.
and
it
--
it
really
isn't
involved
in
this
case
but
--
well,
let's
say,
in
--
in
your
jurisdiction
in
chicago,
for
example,
they
had
a
number
of
places.
you
had
attorn,
titles,
and
you
have
title
companies,
in
some
places
you
have
dockets
for
types
--
other
types
of
title.
those
people
who
have
judgments
of
money
value
against
them,
in
order
to
docket
it
as
a
lien,
it
has
to
be
docketed
in
a
special
book
so
that
it
will
be
picked
by
abstractors
who
--
a
house
or
something
like
that
or
if
somebody
wants
to
check
your
credit
or
something
like
that,
i
suppose
they
could
it.
but
this
has
--
and
this
is
done
usually
and
not
in
a
federal
--
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
federal
clerk's
office
or
anything
else
because
the
problems
of
liens
are
usually
--
are
controlled
by
this
county
or
state
organization.
so
what
happens
is
that
when
you
have
a
--
a
case
where
a
fine
is
entered
or
it
happens
a
number
of
times
in
--
all
liquor
violations
you
get
fines
of
this
type
of
thing,
that's
done
as
a
--
or
tax
cases
is
automatic.
they
do
this
all
the
time.
they
take
the
tax
judgments
over
and
enter
them
as
a
lien.
now,
that
judgment,
that
lien
entry,
judgment
as
a
lien,
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
--
on
the
question
here.
in
other
words,
the
entry
of
a
judgment
somewhere
else
to
perfect
a
civil
lien
and
i
would
assume
that
this
judgment
would
be
good
as
far
as
a
criminal
is
concerned
even
if
this
entry
had
never
been
made,
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
a
question
of
taking
a
criminal
appeal.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it's
on
--
this
is
the
original
one.
and
that's
always
done.
i
mean
that's
where
the
clerk
stands
right
on.
you
can
find
out
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
robinson
flatly
controls
the
first
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
second
issue
which
is
the
question
of
going
back
and
getting
a
new
judgment,
i
think
is
--
is
directly
contrary
to
the
--
the
rule
which
says
that
district
judge
may
not
enlarge
the
time
because
to
allow
this
sort
of
thing
would
as
in
this
case.
he
got
a
--
a
month
and
a
half.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
doubt
that
if
there's
something
wrong
with
the
resentence,
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
that
and
we
say
so
but
that
does
not
open
up,
that
does
not
open
up
the
whole
conviction
on
--
or
the
whole
or
the
original
judgment
for
appellate
review.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
only
--
i
only
concede
he
is
right
if
he
has
a
question
relating
to
the
second
--
to
the
reduction
but
when
you
realize
that
he
asked
for
a
day
or
two
and
he
got
four
months,
he
is
hardly
in
a
position
to
--
to
make
any
serious
argument
about
the
reduction
and
it's
purely
discretionary
with
the
judge.
i
don't
know
what
he
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
the
government
should
have
possibly
because
we
should
have
made
this
kind
of
argument.
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
opens
up
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we've
this
whole
series
of
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
where
people
have
used
all
types
of
devices
to
reenter
something
to
get
started
again
just
because
of
this
type
of
thing.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
this
--
that's
what
this
case
--
this
judge
did.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
--
we've
had
judges
--
we've
cited
cases
where
judges
have
deliberately
reentered
orders
or
reentered
something
in
order
to
give
--
but
i
can't
see
that
that
would
make
any
difference
really
what
you
do.
i
mean
if
the
whole
purpose
--
here,
the
judge
is
deliberately
enlarging
the
man's
time
to
take
an
appeal.
the
rule
--
i
think
in
unmistakable
terms,
says,
that
the
judge
may
not
enlarge
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal
because
otherwise
--
you
see
there're
two
sides
to
the
coin.
and
the
fact
--
and
if
you're
going
to
allow
the
judge
to
enlarge
it,
you
--
you're
also
going
to
allow
him
the
withhold
it.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
we've
tried
to
avoid
in
the
--
in
the
whole
setup
of
criminal
rules
that
--
that
it
shouldn't
be
a
matter
that
you
just
go
in
and
have
to
ask
leave
of
the
judge
to
take
an
appeal.
you
have
10
days
and
you
take
it.
it
isn't
something
he
can
give
you
and
it
isn't
something
he
can
take
away
from
you.
and
in
effect,
that
is
what
petitioner
is
asking
for
in
that
--
in
that
regard.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
i
think
it's
fairly
obvious
what
they
--
what
had
happened.
the
united
states
government
filed
a
motion
--
have
filed
an
affidavit
--
we
had
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
it
doesn't
--
court
of
appeals
doesn't
know
what
happened
unless
we
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
you
see
our
motion
to
dismiss,
you
will
see
that
we
outlined
what
had
happened
previously.
and
immediately,
the
--
and
filed
the
evidence,
second
panel,
a
different
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
could
see
that
what
this
was,
it
was
an
attempt
to
take
a
second
appeal.
if
--
if
--
let
me
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
let
me
put
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it's
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
original
conviction.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
what
you
are
posing
had
been
the
case,
in
other
words,
if
there
was
some
error
in
the
reduction
process
that
could
be
appealed,
certainly,
it
would
have
been
incumbent
upon
the
petitioner
to
say
something
about
that
and
he
didn't
say
anything
about
that
when
he
filed
his
affidavit.
he
just
recited
again
his
excuses
for
not
taking
the
original
appeal.
so
that
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
--
was
well-advised
to
dismiss
the
--
the
second
one.
the
petitioner
argued
that
--
i
should
mention
the
things
it
covered
in
the
brief.
one
is
this
problem
of
saturday
in
new
york
courts.
of
course,
it
depends
upon
which
new
york
court
you
look
to,
i
suppose
because
some
new
york
courts
are
open
all
the
time,
saturdays
and
sundays.
so
that
if
you
--
if
you
start
to
adopt
some
type
of
procedure
related
to
local
practice,
i
think
we
would
have
a
hodgepodge
of
taking
appeals.
the
problem
of
full
days
--
i'd
also
do
not
think
is
in
this
case
because
the
rule
certainly
contemplate
that
even
saturdays
and
sundays
in
the
middle
of
the
period
are
to
be
counted,
he
is
not
merely
entitled
to
10
full
business
days.
the
question
of
half
a
day
was
also
recognized
by
the
rules
because
the
rule
specifically
stated
that
a
half
a
day
should
be
counted
as
a
full
day.
in
any
event,
let
me
say
this
that
if
this
petitioner
had
made
any
real
effort
to
file
this
notice
of
appeal
on
saturday
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
his
lawyer
or
the
petitioner,
that's
not
unusual,
mr.
justice
black.
in
cases
where
defendants
are
out
on
bail
for
them
to
be
constantly
calling
their
lawyer
about
--
about
notices
of
appeal,
this
is
rather
common
and
it's
--
it's
common
all
the
way
through
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
they
did.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
so,
that
have
--
and
i
would
say
something
further
about
saturdays.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
might
be
wise
to
eliminate
saturdays
in
the
proposed
amendments
to
the
criminal
rules
aren't
going
to
eliminate
saturday
from
a
period
of
computation
just
as
it's
been
eliminated
in
the
civil
cases.
but
we
think
that
thing
should
be
handled
--
it's
going
to
be
handled
that
way
of
--
by
the
regular
rule
making
process.
well,
the
second
issue
i
--
as
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
i
think
so.
as
a
--
he
can
raise
it
that
way
or
he
can
raise
it
under
rule
35
if
he
has
grounds
for
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
or
he
can
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we've
never
--
we've
never
felt
he
could
but
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
some
--
sometimes
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
either
way
if
it
comes
up.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
or
even
coram
nobis
if
we
--
if
it
has
to
go
back.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
not
as
yet.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
if
--
no.
what
he
asked
for
in
his
motion
was
a
reduction
of
--
he
asked
for
a
number
of
things
in
relief
to
the
district
judge.
he
asked
that
his
sentence
be
reduced.
he
asked
that
if
that
not
be
so
that
he'd
be
allowed
an
extended
period
of
time
before
he
started
to
serve
his
sentence,
in
other
words,
time
to
adjust
his
affairs.
this
is
the
type
of
relief
that
he
asked
for
at
the
time
of
the
motion
under
rule
35.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
ask
for
a
new
trial
or
something
like
that
in
the
sense
of
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
go
to
the
merits
because
--
well,
some
of
the
merits,
of
course,
are
bound
to
come
out
every
time
you
--
you
start
talking
about
it
but
i
don't
think
that
they
were
primarily
there.
and
certainly,
if
--
if
that's
what
he
meant,
i
think
he
could've
made
himself
a
little
more
clear
as
to
--
that
he
didn't
--
in
other
words,
if
he
--
what
he
really
meant,
instead
of
rule
35
reduction,
was
that
i
want
to
attack
my
conviction
now
collaterally.
i
think,
at
least
saying
something
like
that
would've
alerted
the
--
the
judge
to
the
problem
that
he
was
presenting
but
i
don't
think
you'll
find
that
in
this
motion
at
all
or
in
these
papers
that
he
filed
at
that
time.
so
that
we
feel
that
this
would
fly
in
the
face
of
all
the
rules
of
--
that
--
on
the
time
and
unlike
the
civil
cases
by
the
way
which
this
court
has
had
recently,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
done
here
during
this
period,
so
that
what
--
what
happens
is
you
really
have
to
revive
it.
now,
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
think
this
is
evaluation
for
committee
of
rules
and
the
question
whether
to
extend
times,
whether
to
give
everybody
appeals
maybe
within
10
days,
cut
the
whole
thing
off
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
are
--
yes.
there
is
one
and
there's
no
question
that
this
consideration
of
saturday,
that's
all
that
had
been
printed
by
the
proposed
--
and
we
cite
that
in
our
brief.
the
appellate
rules
are
under
another
advisory
committee
and
their
treating
of
the
whole
may
have
not
published
any
affairs
but
you
can
see
in
the
articles
that
this
problem
is
under
consideration.
in
some,
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
proposing
a
series
of
strained
and
technical
interpretations
to
--
would
create
just
a
hodgepodge
in
--
in
the
manner
of
taking
appeals
which
we
think
are
rather
simple.
and
to
throw
out
these
rules
and
standards,
would
really
turn
us
back
to
where
we
were
over
30
years
ago
when
you
used
to
have
to
ask,
leave
to
appeal
and
when
you
used
to
take
periods
of
time
and
extend
them
beyond.
and
we
think
all
of
this
was
done
away
with
when
they
started
the
new
civil
rules.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
both
dismissals
should
be
affirmed.
