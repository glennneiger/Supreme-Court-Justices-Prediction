suppose
you
did,
would
it
have
any
effect
on
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
argument
or
the
holding
either
or
the
philosophy
of
the
noia
case
has
any
relationship
to
that
question?
justice

jurisdictional
matters
to
do
what?
justice
hugo

black
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
there
was
a
10-day
rule
appeal
in
that
case
and
they
were
delayed
and
if
we
prove
them
that
that
confession
had
been
coerced
as
it
was
in
brown
against
mississippi.
would
you
say
that
that
could
be
in
fact
collaterally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
there
was
much
discussion
of
that
type
of
question
in
fay
against
noia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
philosophy
which
you
have
just
expressed
in
connection
with
appeals.
the
right
not
to
have
your
constitutional
right
cut-off
and
when
it
is
to
be
cut-off,
violated,
by
delay
and
put
into
proceeding,
a
failure
to
raise
it
at
the
proper
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
i
think
you'd
be
very
fortunate
to
concede
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
dispute
about
the
reason
why
this
one
--
this
appeal
was
one
day
late?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
been
instructed
to
file
the
appeal
that
afternoon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
until
monday.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
when
did
you
go
to
the
judge,
that
amending
motion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose,
if
it
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
again,
jurisdiction
whatever
that
would
mean,
how
can
it
have
been
--
had
jurisdiction
or
even
had
print
this?
it
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
man
had
had
no
lawyer
at
all
and
he
had
not
taken
the
appeal
within
10
days,
that's
all
that
occurs,
the
court
sends
him,
he
had
no
lawyer,
could
the
court
have
dismissed
his
appeal
because
he
filed
it
late?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
but
the
reason
i'm
asking
you
is
because
the
rule
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

judge
to
take
the
appeal
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you'd
be
much
better
off
without
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
lawyer
--
but
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
does
have
a
lawyer
and
he
suggests
it,
then
he's
out
of
luck.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
can't
get
his
constitutional
question
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
there
a
constitutional
question
involved
in
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
--
may
be
at
a
lose
if
you
had
a
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
suppose
the
record
shows
clearly
that
he
had
been
denied
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment,
do
you
think
he
could
it
attack
collaterally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
his
lawyer's
mistake
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
hate
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
--
when
we
get
through,
if
we
dismissed
that
then,
i
will
presume,
this
man
could
still
raise
the
2255
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
of
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
rule
certainly
did
try
to
take
some
precaution
to
see
that
a
defendant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
not
lose
his
right
of
appeal
because
of
his
ignorance,
isn't
it?
