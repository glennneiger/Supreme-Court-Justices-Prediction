justice

understanding
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
i
suppose
it's
important
to
know
what
the
theory
of
the
government
was
in
the
district
court.
did
the
government
urge
this
theory,
the
theory
urged
in
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
government's
position
in
the
trial
court
was
what
competition
was
furnished
by
the
--
by
the
joint
venture
is
wholly
irrelevant.
it
shouldn't
even
be
considered
by
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
--
i
mean
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
was
irrelevant
to
compare
that
--
the
competition
between
the
joint
venture
and
what
would've
been
true
without
it,
that
just
the
mere
making
of
a
joint
venture
was
the
--
was
the
point.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
government
even
attempted
to
prove
what
the
situation
would
be
absent
the
joint
venture.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
trouble
is
that
the
line
of
commerce
met,
for
example,
is
an
automobile,
i
suppose
and
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
so
because
they've
been
in
competition
before
this
in
the
--
in
--
in
automobiles.
in
this
case,
neither
olin
nor
pennsalt
have
been
in
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
i
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
would
agree
with
you,
that
would
be
bad
but
here,
neither
party
has
been
--
neither
party
has
been
engaged
in
competition
with
each
other
and
only
one
of
them
has
ever
been
in
the
line
of
commerce
that
--
that
you
admit
is
the
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
never
been
engaged
in
this
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trial
court
so-found.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
so
well
equipped
that
when
they
made
the
joint
venture,
they
left
the
other
company
to
run
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
suppose,
just
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
--
how
much
was
pennsalt
in
position
to
sale
in
the
southeast
just
as
a
matter
of
plant
capacity
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
it
had
to
absorbed
freight
to
sell
what
it
did
in
--
in
the
southeast.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
were
selling
down
there
is
what
they
didn't
need
in
their
profitable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
market
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
had
reached
its
--
the
peak
as
far
as
penetration
of
the
southeastern
marketed.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
probably,
i
suppose,
would
satisfy
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
reference?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
it
that
the
government
actually
said
that,
in
argument
or
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
judge
steele
referred
to
it
in
his
opinion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
was
referring
to
some
statement
made
by
counsel,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
these
two
companies
had
never
been
in
competition
with
one
another
in
this
line
--
line
of
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
argument
doesn't
have
to
--
that
you
make
doesn't
reach
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
suggest,
under
your
argument,
that
--
that
such
a
joint
venture
would
be
legal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
this
case?
assuming
that
mathieson
--
olin
mathieson
had
been
engaged
in
making
this
product,
say,
in
the
midwest
and
the
--
pennsalt
had
been
engaged
in
making
it
and
distributing
it
in
the
farwest,
and
then
they
both
--
both
substan
--
they
were
--
have
both
been
in
this
line
of
commerce
and
then
they
had
--
but
not
in
competition
with
another,
and
then
they
had
both
entered
into
the
southeastern
market.
your
--
your
approach
does
cover
that
situation,
i
would
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
put
that
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
and
you
would
put
aside
where
two
competitors
for
majority
joint
venture
to
develop
new
technology
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
connelly,
i
gather
that
your
argument
would
cover
the
one
or
two
examples
i
chatted
with
your
colleague
about,
where
two
existing
competitors
form
a
new
company
together,
like
penn-olin
to
--
to
enter
a
new
market,
your
argument
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
similarly,
in
--
between
--
in
agreement
between
two
competitors
to
use
such
instrumentality
to
develop
new
technology
in
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
develop
a
new
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
agree
that
having
your
--
if
olin
went
in
just
the
fact
that
pennsalt
is
on
the
sidelines
is
rather
a
neutral
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
characterize
it
in
some
way
that
it
probably
would've
gone
in
or
possibly
would've
gone
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
would've
gone
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
their
ever
readiness
that
you
do
--
you
must
deduce
from
certain
other
facts
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
are
in
the
record,
certain
numbers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
evidence
that
was
addressed
specifically
to
that
issue
is
--
isn't
very
favorable.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
are
these
other
facts
argued.
