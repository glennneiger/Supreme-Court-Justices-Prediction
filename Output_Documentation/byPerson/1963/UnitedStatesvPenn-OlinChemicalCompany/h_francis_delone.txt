mr.
h.
francis
delone
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
please.
i
represent
pennsalt
chemicals
company
and
albert
connelly,
who
represents
olin,
will
divide
the
argument
for
the
appellees
with
me.
i
shall
deal
sincerely,
and
what
might
seem
to
be
somewhat
illogically
at
first,
with
the
facts
and
how
they
relate
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
in
other
words,
assuming,
for
purposes
of
my
discussion,
the
applicability
of
section
7
to
this
type
of
transaction
because
that
discussion
--
the
facts
and
that
question
are
so
intimately
related,
they
don't
lend
themselves
to
any
division
and,
with
the
court's
indulgence,
mr.
connelly
will
then
take
up
the
point
last
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general,
whether
section
7,
in
any
event,
has
any
application
to
a
transaction
such
as
this
and,
if
not,
whether
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
has
been
violated
in
this
case.
prior
to
the
argument
which
i've
just
heard,
i
thought
we
were
all
pretty
much
in
agreement,
both,
the
government,
the
appellees
in
the
court
below
about
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
government
stated
the
issue
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
16,
saying,
"the
district
court
properly
recognized
that
the
lessening
of
competition
standard,"
that
is,
the
lessening
competition
standard
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
"lessening
of
competition
standard
requires
a
comparison
between
the
competitive
situation
brought
about
by
the
chairman
of
transaction
and
the
situation
which,
with
reasonable
probability,
would
have
existed
had
the
transaction
not
occurred.
this
appears
again
in
the
government's
brief
now
at
page
28
and,
in
effect,
the
government,
the
court
below,
and
indeed,
all
of
us
have
thought
up
to
now,
that
what
was
involved
in
order
to
decide
this
case
was
a
comparison
between
the
competitive
situation
which
existed
in
the
southeastern
sodium
chlorate
market
prior
to
penn-olin
and
the
situation
which
existed
or
came
into
being
after
penn-olin.
so
that,
if
penn-olin
brought
about
a
more
competitive
situation,
enhanced
competition
to
a
greater
degree
than
would've
been
the
case
if
the
joint
venture
had
not
been
formed,
then
there's
no
violation
of
section
7
because
competition
has
not
been
lessened.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
ammonium
perchlorate
is
the
product.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
is
a
product
made
from
sodium
chlorate
which
is
used
in
connection
with
--
well,
it
has
various
classified
uses,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sir.
i'm
not
able
to
explain
them
competently
in
any
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
there
is
--
there
may
be
a
higher
profit,
depending
on
what
the
government,
which
is
the
chief
customer,
pays
for
the
profit.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
this
involves
some,
first
of
all,
getting
on
a
phrase
--
just
what
the
profit
might
be.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes.
now,
this
is,
however,
essentially,
i
think
we
all
agree,
a
decision
which
rests
on
undisputed
facts
and
which
must
be
made,
both
sides
agree,
accepting
the
findings
of
the
court
below.
mr.
cox
did
not
devote
too
much
time
to
the
facts
because
on
his
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
the
facts
become
relatively
unimportant.
but
if
one
is
going
to
make
the
type
of
analysis
of
whether
there
really
was
a
lessening
of
competition
in
this
case
because
of
this
joint
venture,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
necessary
to
pause
to
look
at
the
facts,
at
least
briefly.
the
situation
prior
to
the
formation
of
penn-olin,
it
was
formed
by
pennsalt
and
olin
mathieson
in
the
early
part
of
1960.
prior
to
that
time,
in
the
southeastern
sodium
chlorate
market,
which
is
admittedly
the
relevant
market
and
the
relevant
product
in
this
case,
no
dispute
between
us,
the
situation
had
been
that
for
almost
a
decade,
there
had
been
no
new
entrants
into
that
market.
prices
had
been
stable.
there
had
been
no
innovations
and
hooker
chemical
company
and
american
potash,
often
referred
to
in
this
record
as
am-pot,
had
--
they
dominated
the
market.
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned
what
the
figures
were.
they
held
some
91--
a
little
over
91%
of
the
market
in
the
year
1960.
9%
--
to
come
to
--
mr.
justice
clark's
question,
9%
did
--
had
been
shipped
in
that
year,
that
is
1960,
the
year
when
these
statistics
--
to
which
these
statistics
apply,
had
been
shipped
from
tacoma
--
from
pennsalt
tacoma,
washington
plant
into
the
southeast
under
a
temporary
arrangement
between
pennsalt
and
olin
aimed
at
exploring
the
possibility
of
the
joint
venture
which
did,
ultimately,
materialize.
these
sales
have
been
going
on
for
a
period
of
three
years.
prior
to
1960,
only
one-third
as
much
had
been
sold
by
olin,
as
was
sold
in
the
year
1960
when
the
joint
venture
was
announced.
in
other
words,
once
it
was
announced
that
the
joint
venture
was
coming
in,
then,
olin
was
enable
to
sell
more
of
this
product
in
anticipation
of
the
joint
venture
and
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
olin
got
it
for
two
years
prior
to
that
time
in
quantities
of
2000
tons
--
or
a
little
over
1000
tons
a
year
from
pennsalt
company.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
there
are
not
figures
of
the
exact
percentages
in
those
earlier
years
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
as
i
recall
it,
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
well,
virtually,
your
honor.
there
was
one
customer
who
preferred
to
buy
from
pennsalt
because
he
could
--
his
freight
car
could
move
to
the
west
coast
and
back
with
various
allowances
which
made
it
the
desirable
to
him
actually
to
buy
it
from
a
distance,
but
this
was
a
matter
of
400
or
500
tons.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
in
the
year
1960,
the
court
found
that
it
lost
$80,000
on
the
sales
that
it
made
to
the
southeast.
the
freight
differential
--
the
freight,
we
should
have
to
absorb
but
some,
i
think,
was
$25
a
ton.
i'm
not
certain
of
that
figure.
it
is
in
judge
steele's
opinion.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes
and
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
--
by
1960,
they
did
need
it
in
their
west
coast
operation
because
they'd
expanded
in
1957
and,
by
1960,
their
--
their
whole
capacity
was
able
to
be
consumed
in
the
west
coast
so,
obviously,
they
didn't
want
to
continue
to
ship
it
into
the
east,
and
they
did
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that's
correct.
it
really
had
exceeded
it
solely
for
purpose
of
getting
into
the
market
in
the
joint
venture.
it
was
not
a
realistic
transaction
at
9%
in
the
year
1960.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
the
plant
was
built
beginning
in
1961.
production
commenced
in
september
of
1961,
and
this
case
was
tried
in
november
of
1961.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
the
--
the
court
summarized
this
in
its
opinion
at
page
1579
with
a
chart.
if
i
think
i
have
your
honor's
correct
--
question
correctly,
which
lists
the
capacities
of
the
various
southeastern
plants
in
1959
and
then
in
1962.
and
you
will
see
that
hooker,
the
largest,
had
a
capacity
of
29,000
in
1959,
a
capacity
of
32,000
in
1962,
am-pot,
12,000
in
1959,
22,500
in
1962.
pennsalt
--
penn-olin's
plant,
26,500,
it
came
in
with
a
substantial
plant
much
larger
than
the
one
which
either
had
been
considering,
which
put
it
on
more
equal
footing
with
the
existing
competition.
and,
ppg,
by
this
time,
had
also
announced
--
it
announced
in
july
of
1961
and
it
then
comes
into
the
picture
as
a
new
entrant
with
a
15,000-ton
plant.
so,
the
capacity
in
this
market
had
gone
from
41,000
to
96,000
between
the
year
15
--
1959
and
the
year
our
plant
was
in
fact
built,
1961,
the
projection
for
1962
as
i've
just
stated.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
sir?
mr.
h.
francis
delone
the
court
found
that,
by
1960,
judge
steele
found
that
the
southeast
was
no
longer
a
deficit
area.
i
think
this
is
as
close
as
one
can
come
to
what
it
would
absorb.
because
of
the
date
of
trial,
we
do
not
in
fact
have
in
this
record,
figures
as
to
what
each
company
is
today
selling
in
the
market,
although
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
state
them
so
far
as
penn-olin
is
concerned.
it's
not
in
the
record.
in
fact,
we
are
not
selling
at
capacity
today.
as
soon
as
penn-olin
was
announced,
there
was
marked
increased
competitive
activity
on
the
part
of
both
hooker
and
am-pot
in
this
market.
they
went
around
to
their
customers
and
offered
five-year
contracts
with
a
guarantee
of
no
price
increase.
they
took
on
technical
service
and
increased
their
sales
efforts.
the
government
offered
no
evidence
below
from
consumers
or
competitors,
all
of
whom
had
been
interviewed
by
the
government,
as
the
trial
judge
pointed
out.
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
competition
had
been
lessened
by
penn-olin.
the
government
called
the
sales
manager
of
american
potash,
a
mr.
derksen,
and
mr.
derksen
testified
to
the
contrary
that
competition
continued
vigorous
and
had
not
been
lessened
by
penn-olin.
the
court,
therefore,
found
that
the
advent
of
penn-olin
and,
later,
ppg
will
in
all
likelihood
increase
the
competition
which
theretofore
existed
and
will
bring
to
buyers
of
sodium
chlorate
and
to
the
public
the
benefits
which
normally
result
there
from.
now,
the
government,
i
take
it,
doesn't
really
contest
that
there
was
enhancement
of
competition,
but
they
really
are
saying
it
would've
been
even
better
to
keep
these
possibilities
or
probabilities
that
have
been
talked
about.
mr.
cox
indicates
there
were
four
possibilities.
one,
the
possibility
that
but-for
penn-olin,
both
pennsalt
and
olin
would've
entered
the
market.
two,
that
one
would've
entered
and
one
would
have
stayed
in
the
wings.
three;
that
they
would
have
gone
into
a
joint
venture
and
four
that
neither
would
have
entered.
he
overlooks
one
but
which
there
was
discussion
by
the
trial
judge,
the
possibility
that
one
would
have
entered
and,
after
that
one
had
entered,
the
other
would
have
lost
interest.
this
is
really
a
fifth
possibility
which
was
dealt
with
by
the
court
below,
and
the
court
below
pointed
out
with
reference
to
that
possibility
that
at
least
pennsalt,
prior
to
the
time
that
penn-olin
was
formed,
pennsalt
had
formulated
the
judgment
that
the
market
could
stand
only
one
additional
competitor.
so
that,
if
you
assume
that
olin
might,
otherwise,
have
gone
in,
this,
under
that
view,
would've
meant
that
pennsalt
would
have
been
--
been
eliminated,
no
longer
in
the
wings,
if
you
will,
i
think
what
its
purpose.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
he
did
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
he
did
indeed.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
agree
with
you.
he
did
ask
you
to
look
at
the
long
term.
the
difficulty
here
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it's
a
little
hard
to
look
at
and
no
evidence
was
adduced.
he
seems
to
be
urging
now
that
the
kind
of
very
careful
consideration
which
he
concedes
was
given
to
this
case
by
the
court
below
should
not
be
given
in
any
section
7
case.
that,
instead,
you
would
pose
a
general
rule
which
would
automatically
apply
and,
i
think,
in
its
logical
extension,
would
really
outlaw
every
merger
without
the
court
coming
to
grips
with
whether
there
was
any
lessening
of
competition.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
where
his
argument
takes
him.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes,
sir.
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
through
its
chemical
division
known
as
columbia
southern,
entered
the
market
in
july
of
1961.
this
was
over
the
actual
entry
and
announcement
of
it
was
after
penn-olin
had
been
announced
and
shortly
before
our
plant
was
on
stream.
so,
for
practical
purposes,
they
came
into
the
market
with
a
15,000-ton
plant
following
the
formation
and
the
beginning
of
the
construction
of
the
penn-olin
plant.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
would
--
it
would
negate
it
from
--
so
far
as
ppg
is
concerned
perhaps,
but
not
from
the
standpoint
of
the
decision
making
process
of
the
two
companies,
pennsalt
and
olin.
this
was
pennsalt's
conclusion.
if
i
understand
your
honor’s
question,
not
only
one
additional
company
could
come
in.
now,
of
course,
if
two
come
in,
it
makes
the
likelihood
that
pennsalt
at
some
future
date
would
enter
even
more
remote.
it
makes
it
more
an
ephemeral
possibility,
if
you
will,
to
use
the
words
i
think
was
the
brown
shoe
case.
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
the
findings
in
the
court
below,
you
will
see
that
the
pennsalt
management
had
considered
this
problem
beginning
back
as
early
as
1951,
that
they
want
to
this
southeastern
market.
they'd
studied
it
and
restudied
it.
they'd
contemplated
plants
of
various
sizes.
they'd
had
various
projections
made.
each
time
that
they
actually
came
to
grips
with
making
a
decision,
they
decided
against
going
forward.
the
record
at
page
692
appears
the
exhibit
which,
i
think,
most
accurately
reflects
what
was
going
on
within
pennsalt.
this
was
in
1957,
some-six
years
after
they
started
to
think
about
this.
mr.
drake,
the
president
of
pennsalt
asked
the
management
crew,
"do
we
agree
that
it
is
unlikely
in
view
of
the
capital
requirements
and
relatively
low
return
on
investments
that
we
alone
would
approve
construction
of
an
eastern
chlorate
plant?"
second,
"would
olin
mathieson
be
a
logical
partner?"
the
answer
to
both
questions
was
yes.
so
that,
almost
in
the
words
of
the
statute
there,
the
pennsalt
management
faced
the
question
of
whether
it
would
enter
this
market
and
decided
it
was
unlikely
that
it
would.
never
thereafter
was
pennsalt
satisfied
from
a
business
standpoint
with
the
prospects
of
an
adequate
return
on
a
plant
in
the
neighborhood
of
15,000
tons
which
it
was
considering.
olin
turned
to
its
consideration
at
the
management
level
only
in
1958,
really
after
pennsalt
had
crossed
the
bridge
or
--
now,
i
don't
say
that
the
possibility
was
fully
eliminated.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
now.
we
don't
say
that
the
lower
court
found
that
it
wasn't
completely
eliminated.
he
said
we
had
not
found
the
return
attractive
but
he
couldn't
find
it
was
--
we
completely
eliminated
the
chance
of
going
in.
in
any
event,
olin
had
considered
the
matter
first
in
1958
and
then
quite
casually,
except
for
in
the
--
for
laboratory
studies,
for
research
and
development.
and
then
in
1959,
the
chemical
division
of
olin
had
recommended
its
entry
into
the
southeastern
sodium
chlorate
market
with
a
15,000-ton
plant
and
the
management
had,
at
that
time,
rejected
as
not
being
sufficiently
attractive.
again,
we
do
not
contend
that
olin
had
finally
and
forever
crossed
out
the
possibility.
so,
we
concede
there
was
always
a
possibility
that
these
companies,
which
were
able,
could
have
entered
the
market.
but,
this
does
not,
it
seemed
to
--
seems
to
us,
answer
the
question.
the
question
is
would
they
have
entered
the
market,
and
this
is
what
the
lower
court
struggled
with.
it
found
first
that
they
would
not
simultaneously
have
entered
the
market
and
this,
your
honors
will
see
on,
well
reason,
indeed,
that
point
was
not
seriously
contested
by
the
government.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
even
probable,
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
question,
reasoned
by
a
reasonable
probability
to
use
the
correct
language.
but,
the
court
went
beyond
just
determining
whether
both
would've
gone
in
simultaneously.
the
court
said
that
it
had
no
evidence
by
which
to
judge
whether
if
one
had
gone
in,
the
other
would've
continued,
the
other
would've
entered.
this
simply
wasn't
dealt
with.
the
government
didn't
adduce
any
testimony
to
deal
with
that
situation
in
the
court
below.
indeed,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
the
government
agreed
with
the
language
of
the
court
below
that
it
would
be
sheer
speculation
to
decide
what
one
would
have
done
after
the
other
had
entered.
neither
company
had
really
faced
that
situation
and,
the
government
point
--
seems
to
agree,
or
did
at
that
time,
with
judge
steele
who
found
just
that
in
the
court
below.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
reference
is
at
record
page
1576,
so
far
as
the
opinion
is
concerned
sir,
and
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
17
quotes
from
judge
steele's
opinion
at
page
1576.
so
that,
essentially,
i
think
in
fairness
to
judge
steele
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
h.
francis
delone
no,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
at
page
17.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
oh
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
this
was
what
judge
steele
said
"on
the
basis
of
the
evidence,
it
would
be
sheer
speculation
to
try
to
say
what
would've
happened
had
one
of
these
companies
entered,
and
then
--
then
you
had
no
clue
in
the
record"
is
the
language
he
used,
and
"it
would
be
sheer
speculation
to
say
what
the
other
would've
done.
"this
is
not
a
reasonable
probability.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
developed
before
judge
steele
and,
the
government,
before
this
court,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
seemed
to
accept
and
endorse
that
very
language.
the
net
result
then,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
penn-olin
took
two
companies,
neither
of
which
was
at
all
committed
to
going
into
this
market.
indeed,
the
fact
they
had
studied
it
for
some
time
and
rejected
it
suggests
they
never
would.
and,
it
combined
pennsalt's
manufacturing
experience,
which
sold
and
derived
in
the
west
coast,
and
the
fact
that
olin
was
well
equipped
to
make
sales
in
this
market,
it
put
those
two
together
in
order
to
bring
to
this
market
a
third
competitor.
this
was
the
benefit
which
judge
steele
found
flowed
from
this
transaction.
the
government
has
talked
at
considerable
length
about
the
best
postulate
or
that
best
possible
postulate
which
appears
in
judge
steele's
opinion
at
page
1576
and
this
is
the
postulate
that,
at
best,
one
company
might
have
gone
in
while
the
other
continued
to
ponder,
which
is
the
language
of
judge
steele's
opinion.
and
judge
steele,
i
think,
reading
his
opinion
fairly,
finds
that,
on
this
record,
the
government
offered
no
evidence
and
the
court
had
no
basis
by
which
he
could
compare
the
level
of
competition
which
would
have
pertained
under
that
best
postulate,
not
a
finding
but
a
postulate,
but
there's
no
basis
for
the
comparison.
the
very
comparison
which,
initially,
the
government
conceded
should
be
made.
how
do
you
compare
the
before
and
after?
the
"but-for
penn-olin"
situation,
this
is
what
judge
steele
found
lacking
in
this
record
and
he
said
at
page
1576
of
his
opinion,
"the
government
argues
that
any
such
comparison
to--
with
the
comparison
between
competition
before
penn-olin
and
--
i'm
sorry,
the
competition
but
for
penn-olin
and
the
competition
with
them,
any
such
comparison
--
the
government
argues
that
any
such
comparison
is
irrelevant
in
a
determination
that
olin
or
pennsalt
would
have
built
its
own
plant
but
for
penn-olin
automatically
condemns
the
joint
venture.
"such
an
interpretation
would
cut
the
heart
out
of
section
7.
and,
your
honors
will
see
in
the
footnote
at
page
--
to
that
portion
of
the
transcript,
his
opinion
at
page
1576,
judge
steele
copied
in
there
the
transcript
of
the
argument
where
the
government,
in
effect,
told
judge
steele
that
such
a
comparison
should
not
and
would
not
be
made.
therefore,
the
fact
is
that
the
government
didn't
offer
any
evidence
to
permit
a
comparison
of
the
benefits
to
competition
which
flowed
from
the
formation
of
penn-olin
versus
what
the
condition
of
competition
would've
been
but-for
penn-olin.
and,
that
is
essentially
what
brings
the
government
to
the
position
which
has
been
urged
before
your
honors
which
is
that,
automatically,
without
any
careful
determination,
such
as
was
made
here,
without
any
careful
consideration
of
the
evidence,
if
four
conditions
prevail,
any
transaction
such
as
this
should
be
condemned.
indeed,
it's
really
three
conditions,
as
i
understand
mr.
cox's
argument.
first,
he
says
if
there's
an
expanding
market,
and
i've
indicated
the
judge
said
this
was
no
longer
a
deficit
area
in
1960.
second,
each
company
was
in
that
line
of
business,
and
just
what
he
means
by
that
condition,
i'm
not
clear.
olin
had
never
made
this
product
commercially.
pennsalt
was
not
an
effective
competitor
in
this
market,
as
the
lower
court
found.
so
that,
whether
either
was
--
was
in
that
line
is
uncertain
to
me.
that
each
was
fully
equipped,
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
these
companies
had
the
ability
financially
and
resource-wise
to
go
into
the
business.
they
could
have
gone
into
it.
and
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
in
the
limited
sense
of
selling
2000,
but
not
producing.
they
were
not
producing.
this
was
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that's
right.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
to
the
extent
of
some-3000
tons
sold
after
penn-olin
had
been
announced.
previously,
they
had
never
sold
more
than
about
1500
tons
which
is
a
very
drop
in
the
bucket,
maybe
2%,
3%.
i
don't
--
because
we
don't
--
i
don't
have
those
figures
readily
available,
for
those
years,
i
can't
give
you
precise
percentages.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
not
--
not
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
selling
in
the
southeast.
this
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
they
--
well,
they
didn't
have
existing
capacity.
they
had
the
technological
ability
to
either
--
or
they
could've
bought
technology
presumably
with
which
to
construct
their
plant
and
enter
this
business.
they've
never
made
the
product
and
the
record
is
quite
full
of
reservations
on
the
part
of
their
management
as
to
their
ability
to
be
an
efficient
and
effective
producer.
pennsalt
had
no
concern
on
this
score
because
we've
made
the
product
in
the
west
coast.
olin
had
a
concern
as
to
whether
it
could
do
a
good
job.
it
had
not
had
any
manufacturing
experience
and
necessarily,
this
made
projections
for
them,
on
the
manufacturing
side,
much
more
hazardous
than
for
pennsalt.
on
our
side,
the
difficulty
was
how
to
predict
an
ability
to
make
sales
in
sufficient
volume
to
give
an
attractive
return
of
the
company.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
is
fairly
true
and
--
and
i
want
to
make
entirely
clear
also
that
this
little
--
this
small
sale
of
some
thousand
1500
tons
began
only
in
1957.
it
began
after
pennsalt
had
decided
--
i'm
sorry
it
began
at
the
beginning
of
1958,
after
pennsalt's
management
have
decided
they
would
not
go
in
alone
in
the
passage
that
i
read
to
you
earlier
and
then,
it
decided
olin
would
be
a
logical
partner.
in
other
words,
it
was
exploratory
to
what
ultimately
came
about.
it
gave
them
both
the
chance
to
test
the
market
and
it
was
not
a
transaction
that
it
went
into
for
the
--
for
the
profit
which
could
be
derived
in
those
years.
this
was
looking
to
what
ultimately
came
about
in
this
case.
there
are,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
government's
argument,
a
number
of
shadings
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"potential
competitor.
"
this
court
has
recently
considered
potential
competition
in
the
el
paso
case,
although
whether
that
is
properly
regarded
as
potential
competition
or
actual
competition
might
be
a
subject
of
considerable
discussion.
mr.
justice
douglas
recognized,
in
any
event,
that
in
that
case,
pacific
northwest
was
a
substantial
factor
in
the
california
market.
and,
its
--
and
it
referred
to
its
position,
has
a
competitive
factor
in
that
market
and
commented
that
it
actually
had
been
in
the
market
bidding
for
business.
now,
we're
not
confronted
under
the
decision
below,
in
this
case,
with
a
comparable
situation
of
potential
--
potentiality.
we
are
confronted
purely
and
simply
with
capability
plus
some
interest,
but
not
active
participation
in
that
market.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
when
the
government
dwells
on
the
benefit
to
competition
of
having
someone
in
the
wings,
rather
than
on
stage,
as
penn-olin
is,
it's
important
to
note
that,
in
the
10-year-period
prior
to
the
formation
of
this
joint
venture,
there
were
in
the
wings
pennsalt
and
during
some
of
the
time,
olin,
and
allied
chemical
which
was
selling
--
was
a
sales
agent
for
american
potash
and
was
also
one
of
those
rumored
to
be
contemplating
entry
as
the
government
proved
in
the
court
below
or
offered
evidence
in
the
court
below.
also,
wyandotte
chemical,
another
substantial
chemical
company
rumored
to
be
considering
entry,
as
well
as
virginia
chemical
&
smelting.
now,
the
government
in
the
court
below
said,
"all
these
companies
were
cogitating.
"i
forgot
to
mention
ppg,
too,
because
it,
of
course,
was
another
company
in
the
wings
and
yet,
in
this
decade,
as
the
government
complains
in
its
brief,
competition
was
stagnant.
there
were
two
companies
that
had
the
whole
market,
that
dominated
it,
they
were
entrenched.
so,
what
--
where
is
the
value
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
of
a
company
in
the
wings?
no
value
can
be
discerned
from
this
evidence,
so
far
as
those
companies
were
concerned.
they
didn't
contribute.
they
didn't
liven
up
the
market.
they
didn't
have
any
effect
on
the
market
and
yet,
the
court
--
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
strike
down
this
transaction
which
brings
new
competition
into
this
static
market,
strike
this
down
for
this
possibility
which
is,
really,
it
seems
to
me,
all
the
government
urges,
the
possibility
which
it
could
derive
from
the
fact
questionable
here
of
an
expanding
market
from
the
interest
and
the
capability
of
these
companies.
it
says
that,
"given
that
situation,
you
should
look
no
further.
just
apply
the
touchstone
and
trike
--
strike
the
transaction
down.
"this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
not
what
congress
contemplated
when
it
referred
in
section
7
to
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
the
ephemeral
possibilities
of
what
might
have
happened
someday,
sometime.
this
can
become
to
grip
--
we
can
come
to
grips
with
it
as
and
when
it
does
but,
as
of
now,
there
has
been
no
showing
on
this
record,
after
very
careful
consideration
by
the
court
below,
that
competition
has
been
lessened.
it's
--
to
use
an
analogy
that
i
think
was
used
during
the
argument
in
the
el
paso
case,
the
horse
race
analogy.
this
situation
is
one
where
neither
pennsalt
nor
olin
were
entered
in
the
race.
indeed,
they
were
at
a
different
track
and
the
fact
that
they
were
at
a
different
track
didn't
add
any
competition
to
the
race
between
hooker
and
am-pot
in
the
southeastern
track.
the
--
i
suppose
the
simpler
way
to
phrase
it
is
simply
that
the
penn-olin
burden
have
this
word
"competitively"
the
two
in
the
bush.
the
court
below
concluded,
after
careful
review
of
the
evidence,
that
penn-olin
was
the
means
by
which
the
strength
of
two
companies
was
joined,
not
for
the
purpose
of
further
preempting
a
market
which
they
already
occupied,
but
to
break
into
a
market
to
challenge
the
supremacy
of
two
companies
which
were
dominating
it.
congress,
in
amending
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
recognized
that
all
combinations
were
not
anticompetitive
and
that,
in
some
--
some
instances,
combinations
may
have
the
effect
of
stimulating
competition,
citing
of
the
brown
shoe
case
and
one
might
think
of
many
others
that
follow
this
line.
he
concluded
the
probabilities
are
that
penn-olin
will
have
that
effect
to
what
the
effect
of
stimulating
competition.
he
made
the
determination
required
of
him
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
under
that
determination,
there
was,
in
fact,
no
lessening
of
competition
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
the
conclusion
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
is
at
record
1579.
the
earlier
comment
about
joining
the
strength
of
the
two
companies
is
at
page
27
and
28
(a),
i
do
not
have
the
--
of
the
opinion
as
printed
in
jurisdictional
statement.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
don't
have
the
precise
language
elsewhere.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
think
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
yes,
yes.
i
should
like
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
should
like
to
say
about
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
about
el
paso
one
further
point.
that,
in
that
case,
this
court
was
confronted
with
just
one
question.
was
the
lessening
there
involved
a
substantial
lessening?
there
was
no
--
there
could
be
no
suggestion
that
competition
had
been
--
been
enhanced,
as
it
has
been
found
to
have
been
enhanced
here.
there
was
no
new
competition
brought
to
the
california
market.
the
only
question
was
whether
competition
in
that
market
was
substantially
lessened
by
the
elimination
of
a
competitor,
whether
you
treat
it
as
an
actual
or
potential
competitor.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
it
doesn't
reach
el
paso,
no,
sir.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
such
a
joint
venture
would
be.
no,
i
would
not,
under
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
think,
sir,
that
is
quite
a
different
situation
and
one
which
the
court
here
--
mr.
h.
francis
delone
that
--
for
some
later
market
extension
case,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
don't
think
we're
really
faced
at
all
here,
sir,
with
general
motors
and
ford.
mr.
h.
francis
delone
i
think,
for
the
reasons
i
have
endeavored
to
explain,
we
contend
there
was
no
violation
of
section
7
even
were
it
applicable
here
but,
against
the
possibility
that
i
might
not
have
persuaded
your
honors
to
this
effect,
mr.
connelly
will
deal
with
the
fact
that,
in
any
event,
section
7
does
not
apply
to
this
type
of
transaction
and
if
section
7
does
not
apply,
it
could
not
be
condemned
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
