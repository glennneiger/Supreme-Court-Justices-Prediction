mr.
albert
r.
connelly
your
honors,
i
shall
address
myself
to
these
two
points
very
briefly.
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
observation
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
does
not
purport
to
cover
all
acquisitions.
it
does
not
cover,
for
example,
any
non-corporate
acquisitions
and
in
the
case
of
corporate
acquisitions,
its
application
is
limited
to
situations
where
the
acquired
corporation
is
engaged
in
commerce.
with
reference
to
penn-olin,
the
parties
here
are
in
entire
agreement
that
a
new
corporation
is
not
engaged
in
commerce
at
the
moment
of
its
incorporation.
we're
also
in
agreement
that,
therefore,
section
7,
in
this
respect,
is
not
to
be
literally
construed
but
that
provision
must
be
interpreted.
where
we
differ
is
in
the
interpretation.
the
government
would
say
that
the
test
to
be
applied
in
the
case
of
a
new
corporation
is
the
subjective
intent
of
its
incorporators.
if
the
incorporators
desire
or
intend
to
have
it
at
some
point
get
into
interstate
commerce,
that
that
is
sufficient
to
bring
it
within
the
language
of
the
act.
in
my
view,
that
ignores
the
historical
purpose
of
section
7
which
was
aimed
specifically
at
the
elimination
of
existing
enterprises
in
actual
or
potential
competition.
that
is
to
say,
dealing
with
assets
which
were
then
engaged
in
commerce
initially,
of
course,
with
ref
--
by
reference
to
the
acquisition
of
stock
control
and
then
by
the
1950
amendment
dealing
with
the
acquisition
of
the
assets
themselves.
and,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
1950
amendment
of
section
7
was
a
fear
of
what
was
considered
to
be
a
rising
tide
of
economic
concentration
in
the
american
economy.
so
far
as
we
know,
there
has
not
been
any
decision
dealing
with
the
precise
point
that
i
am
now
presenting
to
your
honors.
the
only
cases
which
have
dealt
with
the
acquisition
of
stock
in
a
newly
formed
company
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
view
that
i
have
expressed.
they
each
involved
an
element
of
concentration
by
the
elimination
of
the
independence
of
assets
then
engaged
in
commerce.
as,
for
example,
in
the
alcoa
case
where
a
new
corporation
was
formed
to
takeover
the
existing
business
of
a
competitor,
cleveland
metal
products
company,
a
producer
of
aluminum
sheets
and
in
the
old
new
england
fish
exchange
case,
by
the
formation
of
a
series
of
new
companies
to
takeover
the
existing
wholesale
fish
business
of
companies
then
in
existence.
the
text
writers
have
taken
the
same
view.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
if
i
may,
to
one
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
should've
been
perhaps,
that's
kingman
brewster's
text
on
antitrust
and
american
business
abroad,
published
in
1958.
at
pages
206
and
207,
professor
brewster
dealt
with
the
subject
of
joint
ventures
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
your
honors
just
a
brief
quotation,
if
i
may.
"we
assume
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
will
not
be
applicable
to
most
joint
ventures
since,
prior
to
the
joining,
the
venture
was
not
engaged
in
commerce.
however,
it
should
be
noted
that,
in
form,
financing
of
a
joint
venture
may
involved
the
purchase
by
one
company
of
the
stock
of
a
paper
subsidiary
of
another
which
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
into
being
an
active
industrial
or
extractive
enterprise.
if
jointness
is
achieved
by
partial
acquisition
of
a
preexisting
enterprise,
we
assume
clayton
act
standards
would
apply.
"although
the
argument
is
not
fully
articulated,
there
is
a
suggestion
made
in
the
government's
brief
that,
perhaps,
penn-olin
was
formed
to
takeover
pennsalt's
existing
business.
that,
i
think,
has
been
dealt
with
by
--
dealt
with
already
in
the
argument
today
to
indicate
that,
in
fact,
pennsalt
did
not
have
any
existing
business
and
that
the
only
shipments
that
it
made,
apart
from
the
penn-olin
exploratory
venture,
the
only
shipments
it
made
into
this
territory
were
by
virtue
of
special
customer
relationships.
but,
i
should
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that,
if
it
were
true
that
penn-olin
had
been
formed
to
takeover
an
existing
business
of
pennsalt,
then
that
would
bring
into
play
the
third
paragraph
of
section
7,
under
which,
the
test
of
the
legality
is
not
the
probability
but
the
actuality
of
lessening
competition.
your
honors
have
that
paragraph
in
mind,
the
one
which
deals
with
nothing
shall
prevent
a
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
from
causing
the
formation
of
subsidiary
corporations,
etcetera,
where
the
effect
of
such
formation
is
not
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
the
fact
is
that,
apart
from
these
exploratory
activities
with
olin,
penn-olin
was
not
in
the
market
at
all
and
made
no
attempt
to
sell
there.
it's
a
completely
new
enterprise.
it
was
not
formed
to
take
over
any
existing
facilities
or
assets
that
had
been
devoted
to
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
element
of
concentration
involved
in
penn-olin,
so
far
as
the
chlorate
industry
is
concerned.
on
the
contrary,
it
added
new
production
and
new
sales
to
a
market
up
to
then
dominated
by
hooker
and
american
potash.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
rather
broad
statement
about
developing
new
technology.
if
it's
within
the
line
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
with
--
if
it
were
within
the
existing
--
an
existing
line
of
commerce,
of
course
it
would.
i
can
conceive
of
--
of
some
hypothetical
situation
where
there
might
be
something
so
novel
that
its
attempt
by
two
companies
which
were
actually
engaged
themselves
in
a
related
field
might,
nevertheless,
be
justified.
but,
i
just
don't
want
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
--
too
broadly
on
that.
turning
now
to
the
sherman
act
argument
of
the
government,
first,
your
honors
will
have
in
mind
that
it's
a
very
limited
argument
that
they
make
in
this
connection.
they
say
sherman
act
only
if
section
7
is
held
not
applicable
because
here,
the
acquired
company
was
not
in
fact
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
substance
of
their
argument
involves
two
steps.
first,
a
paraphrase
of
the
statement
made
by
this
court
in
time-picayune
to
the
effect
that
the
specific
standards
of
the
clayton
act
may
be
looked
at
to
illuminate
the
general
policy
of
the
sherman
act.
then,
secondly,
i
should
like
to
put
this
in
appellant's
own
words.
the
fact
that
an
acquisition
would
violate
the
substantive
provisions
of
section
7,
if
the
jurisdictional
prerequisite
had
been
satisfied,
should
be
given
great
weight
in
determining
whether
it
amounts
to
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
there
are
two
fallacies
in
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
the
point
that's
being
made
here
is
not
a
jurisdictional
objection.
there's
no
difficulty,
jurisdictionally
speaking,
from
having
section
7
apply
to
corporations
--
to
the
acquisition
of
assets
not
theretofore
engaged
in
commerce.
it
is
just
as
substantive
as
the
limitation
of
section
7
which
prevents
it
from
applying
to
the
acquisition
of
partnership
assets
by
way
of
illustration,
but
more
importantly,
the
reliance
upon
that
statement
suggests
a
confusion
between
those
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
which
may
properly
be
regarded
as
specifics
relating
to
types
of
practices
specified,
and
those
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
which
relate
to
the
standards
of
illegality.
so
far
as
the
former
is
concerned,
we
have
no
question.
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that,
of
course,
we
can
look
at
the
clayton
act,
its
provisions
with
reference
to
exclusive
dealing
arrangements,
its
provisions
with
reference
to
the
acquisition
of
stock
or
assets
as
a
description
of
practices
that
may
properly
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
sherman
act.
but,
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
provisions
of
the
two
acts
relating
to
the
test
of
illegality,
the
situation
is
entirely
reversed.
there
is
nothing
specific
and,
indeed,
i
can
envisage
nothing
more
general
than
the
test
of
the
clayton
act
where
the
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition,
a
test
which
was
designed
specifically
to
cover
situations
that
had
not
yet
become
restraints
of
trade
reachable
under
the
sherman
act.
and
therefore,
there
cannot
be
a
substitution
of
the
probability
test
of
the
clayton
act
for
the
actuality
test
of
restraints
of
trade
under
the
sherman
act.
so
far
as
i
know,
in
every
case
in
which
an
acquisition
has
been
held
to
be
violative
of
the
sherman
act,
it
involved
a
situation
where
the
acquiring
company
was
then
a
major
factor
in
the
market
and
where
the
acquisition
has
eliminated
a
competitor,
actual
or
potential.
and,
of
course
those
were
recently
reviewed
in
the
bank
cases
and
the
old
railroad
cases.
here,
neither
company
was
a
factor
in
the
market.
the
purpose
and
effect
of
penn-olin
was
not
to
eliminate
any
competition
but
to
provide
new
competition
for
the
two
companies
then
dominating
the
market.
now,
appellant
says
that
the
fact
of
a
joint
venture,
the
fact
of
penn-olin
is
a
joint
venture
doesn't
limit
the
applicability
of
the
sherman
act.
well,
of
course
it
doesn't.
we
don't
make
any
contention
that
it
does,
but
the
fact
that
the
venture
is
joint,
by
the
same
token
doesn't
involve
any
per
se
illegality.
the
joint
venture
took
place
here
only
because
the
parties,
having
considered
separate
entry,
had
decided
or
had
not
reached
the
decision
to
move
forward
and
had
decided
that
the
returns
were
not
sufficiently
attractive.
putting
together
the
two
activities,
taking
the
benefit
of
--
of
pennsalt's
production
experience
in
which
olin
was
deficient,
and
taking
advantage
of
olin's
sales
position
in
the
market
and
other
chemicals
being
sold
to
the
same
paper
producers
created
a
situation
which
did
make
it
sufficiently
attractive
for
the
two
companies
to
move
forward.
the
significant
part
of
the
term
"joint
venture"
in
this
context
is
not
the
word
"joint,"
but
it's
the
word
"venture,"
the
introduction
of
an
entirely
new
competitive
factor
and
taking
away
nothing.
your
honors
will
recall
that,
in
the
du
pont
cellophane
case,
the
du
pont
cellophane
company
was
established
as
a
joint
venture
between
the
du
pont
company
and
the
french
company.
the
government,
here,
argued
with
reference
to
an
agreement
--
an
alleged
agreement
between
the
two
to
divide
markets
that
there
was
illegality
there.
but,
so
far
as
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
neither
the
government
nor
this
court
challenged
that
finding
that
the
joint
venture
itself
was
entirely
lawful,
that
the
organization
of
the
new
company
and
the
continued
ownership
was
lawful,
and
the
court
there
said,
"it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
sherman
act
or
the
common
law
of
restraints
of
trade
to
discourage
establishment
of
a
new
business
in
a
new
territory.
"in
any
view
of
its
case,
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
was
right
and
should
be
affirmed.
