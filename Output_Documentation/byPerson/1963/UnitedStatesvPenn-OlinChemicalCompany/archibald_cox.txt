mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
on
appeal
from
the
district
of
delaware
raises
a
novel
and
an
unusually
interesting
question
under
the
antitrust
laws.
it's
novel
also
in
that
the
facts
are
essentially
very
simple.
two
of
the
appellees,
pennsalt
and
olin
mathieson,
each
a
large
well
equipped
firm,
actively
interested
in
entering
an
important
market
on
its
own,
although
not
fully
committed
to
the
venture,
agreed
to
combine
forces
and
to
enter
the
market
jointly,
thereby,
foreclosing
any
possibility
of
competition
between
the
two
in
that
market,
either
immediately
or
sometime
in
the
longer
run
in
the
future.
the
ultimate
question
here
is
whether
that
combination
violated,
which
was
accomplished
through
a
subsidiary
corporation
whose
stock
they
acquired,
violated
either
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
or
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
question
--
neither
the
question
nor
any
question
like
it
has
been
before
this
court
previously.
the
district
court
prepared
a
careful
and
independent-minded
opinion,
which
not
only
establishes
the
facts,
but
which
i
think
offers
the
best
avenue
for
coming
to
grips
with
the
legal
issues
in
the
case.
the
court
found
that
in
the
southeastern
united
states,
there's
an
important
market
for
sodium
hydrochloride,
a
chemical
that
is
used
in
the
pulp
and
paper
industry
for
the
purposes
of
bleaching.
sodium
hydro
--
hydrochloride
is
the,
agreed
to
be,
the
line
of
commerce
in
the
case
and
the
southeastern
united
states
are
agreed
to
be
the
relevant
section
of
the
country.
in
1959,
there
were
three
suppliers
in
that
market.
hooker
was
a
plant
in
mississippi,
which
sold
49%
of
the
market,
american
potash,
also,
was
a
plant
in
mississippi,
which
sold
41%
and
pennsalt,
which
sold
just
under
9%.
i
should
say
that
pennsalt's
ability
to
compete
in
the
market
with
its
existing
plants
was
distinctly
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
only
plant
in
existence
was
way
out
on
the
west
coast,
so
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
you
had
only
two
suppliers.
during
the
1950s,
the
southeastern
market
for
sodium
hydrochloride
became
more
and
more
attractive
to
new
investors.
olin
mathieson
and
pennsalt,
each
gave
long
and
careful
consideration
to
building
its
own
sodium
hydrochloride
plant
in
the
southeast.
the
district
court
expressly
found
on
page
1574,
that's
in
volume
2
of
the
record,
that
pennsalt
and
olin,
right
at
the
top
of
the
page,
"each
had
had
extensive
background
in
sodium
chloride,"
skipping,
"that
a
suitable
location
for
a
plant
was
available
to
each
company
and
then,
in
short,
that
pennsalt
and
olin,
each
possessed
the
resources
and
general
capability
needed
to
build
its
own
plant
in
the
southeast
and
to
compete
with
hooker
and
am-pot,
american
potash,
in
that
market.
"the
court
also
discussed
the
deliberations
of
each
individual
management
about
individual
entry
and
concluded
back
on
page
1573,
at
the
bottom
of
the
text
and
above
the
footnote,
the
possibility
of
individual
entry
into
the
southeastern
market
had
not
been
completely
rejected
by
either
pennsalt
or
olin
before
they
decided
upon
the
joint
venture.
i
ought
to
pause
here
to
call
attention
to
page
16
of
the
appellees'
brief
where
they
quote
an
excerpt
from
the
testimony
of
olin's
president
intended
to
indicate
that
olin
had
not
--
had
decided
not
to
build
the
plant
on
its
own
even
if
there
were
no
joint
venture.
now,
that
argument
was
made
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
squarely
rejected
it
when
it
found
that
the
possibility
of
individual
entry
had
not
been
completely
rejected
by
either
before
they
decide
it
upon
the
joint
venture.
furthermore,
that
finding,
as
a
footnote
to
the
opinion,
immediately
below
the
quotation,
the
opinion
shows,
was
based
upon
the
statement
of
olin's
own
president
in
his
deposition
which
was
introduced
in
evidence.
the
reference
unhappily
is
not
there
and
we
neglected
to
print
the
deposition
but,
of
course,
it's
here
in
the
court.
the
reference
as
to
plaintiff's
exhibit
402,
unprinted
in
full,
pages
28
and
29
of
the
original
exhibit
and
there,
the
president
stated
as
quoted,
"that
the
question
had
never
reached
the
point
of
final
decision".
furthermore,
the
testimony
quoted
by
counsel,
as
they
also
overlook,
was
qualified
on
cross-examination
and
it
was
substantially
inconsistent
with
testimony
by
one
of
olin's
vice
president,
both
in
his
deposition
and
also
as
given
at
the
trial.
so
that,
i
think
that
the
findings
so
amply
supportive
were
certainly
entitled
to
take
it
as
a
fact
in
this
court
that
olin,
like
pennsalt,
had
not
turned
its
back
on
the
possibility
of
individual
entry.
i
now
come
to
the
crux
of
the
matter,
both
in
the
opinion
and
in
our
analysis
of
the
case.
on
page
1575,
after
finding
at
the
start
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
that
olin
and
pennsalt,
each
had
the
capability
of
building
a
plant
and
competing
individually.
the
district
court
ruled
"that
those
facts
were
important,"skipping
a
few
lines,
"only
--
only
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether,
as
a
matter
of
probability,
both
companies
would
have
entered
the
market
as
individual
competitors
if
penn
and
olin
had
not
been
formed.
only
in
this
event",
the
court
said
"would
potential
competition
between
the
two
companies
have
been
foreclosed
by
the
joint
venture.
"
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
that
there
was
a
probability
that
both
companies
would've
simultaneously
entered
the
bargain
and
he
held
that
if
we
fail
to
prove
that,
we
were
entitled
to
judgment
only
if
we
showed
that
penn-olin,
the
subsidiary
combination,
would
be
a
less
effective
competitor
than
olin
alone
or
pennsalt
alone.
well,
of
course,
we
made
no
such
claim,
could
make
no
such
claim
and
the
district
court,
thereupon,
entered
judgment
for
the
defendants
and
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
now,
our
first
contention
in
this
court
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
united
states,
in
order
to
prove
a
violation
of
section
7,
was
required
to
demonstrate
a
probability
that
both
olin
and
pennsalt
would've
shortly
built
hydrochloride
markets
--
hydrochloride
plants
in
the
absence
of
penn-olin.
our
view
is
that
if
one
company
would've
entered
the
market
and
the
other
would've
remained
in
the
wings
as
a
potential
competitor
available
to
enter,
if
the
commercial
opportunities
became
sufficiently
attractive,
then
the
foreclosure
of
that
future
potential
competition
by
the
combination
rendered
it
one
which
may
substantially
lessen
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
the
defect
in
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
it
took
much
too
short-range
of
view
of
the
matter
and
it,
therefore,
completely
overlooked
the
benefit
to
the
market
of
having
one
firm
in
it
and
an
additional
strong
firm
fully
capable
of
entering
the
market,
sitting
on
the
sidelines,
able
to
become
a
supplier
if
the
price
situation
should
warrant,
if
demand
should
outrun
supply
or
if
there
were
opportunities
for
technical
innovation
or
other
reasons
to
go
in.
there's
no
reason
to
suppose,
of
course,
that
penn-olin
would
be
any
weaker
than
either
of
the
individual
firms
and
indeed,
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
stronger
than
either
of
the
individual
firms.
if
one
looked
only
at
the
immediate
future
and
supposed
that
there
would
be
only
one
entering,
then
it
wouldn't
matter
at
all
whether
it
was
penn-olin
that
went
in,
olin
went
in
or
the
third
one
went
in,
but
the
difference
is
that
you
can't
take
so
short-range
of
view.
the
clayton
act,
like
businessmen,
is
concerned
with
projecting
ahead,
5,
10,
15
years
of
prophylactic
measure
and
the
difference
between
--
if
olin
went
in
alone,
you
would've
still
had
pennsalt
there.
if
pennsalt
went
in
alone,
you
would've
still
had
olin
there,
but
when
you
have
penn-olin
go
in,
you
have
neither
available
as
a
prospective
future
entry.
and
the
existence,
as
i
need
hardly
argue,
of
a
prospective
future
entry,
especially
where
there
is
a
concentration
of
economic
power
as
there
was
in
this
market,
only
two
present
firms,
it's
only
new
--
one
new
and
apparently
going
in,
is
extremely
important
because
it
fixes
a
limit,
not
as
good
as
existing
competitors
but
nevertheless,
some
limit
upon
the
market
power,
the
monopoly
or
oligopolistic
power
of
those
who
are
present.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
you
mean,
what
was
the
state
of
that
market?
there
were
two
firms
in
the
market
before
the
joint
venture
was
embarked
upon.
one
firm
had
49%
and
the
other
firm
had
41%.
pennsalt
was
able
to
ship
a
little
from
the
west
coast
but
i
can't
claim
on
the
findings
that
that
shipment
was
particularly
important.
so,
there
were
only
two
at
the
time
of
the
joint
venture.
the
joint
venture
went
in.
later,
pittsburgh
plate
glass
went
in
but
it
had
not
announced
at
the
time
of
the
joint
venture.
and
indeed,
it's
going
in,
we
think,
confirms
our
view
that
there
were
still
further
opportunities
which
one
of
these
companies
might
have
taken
up.
the
antitrust
laws
have
long
recognized
that
potential
competition
helps
to
set
a
limit
upon
the
market
power
of
the
producers
already
in
the
field.
that
potential
entrants
are
rarely,
perhaps,
never
as
good
as
actual
competitors
there,
still
isn't
a
reason
for
not
preserving
the
protection
to
the
consumer
on
the
public
of
the
prospective
entry.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
--
i
think
we
ultimately
come
to
that,
mr.
justice.
my
argument,
in
a
sense,
has
two
aspects
and
maybe
i
should've
taken
the
time
to
lay
them
out
at
the
start.
the
first
branch
of
it
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
saying
that
we
could
recover
only
if
we
prove
that
both
would
then
and
there
have
gone
in.
when
i
say
would,
i
mean
a
probability
that
both
would
then
and
there
have
gone
in.
now,
we
say
at
the
very
minimum
that
that
was
wrong.
that
if
we
show
the
probability
that
one
would
go
in
while
the
other
remained
a
potential
competitor,
then,
at
least,
we
were
entitled
to
judgment
and
it's
really
to
that
point
that
i'm
addressing
myself
at
the
moment
that
we're
entitled
to
the
chance
to
show
that,
then
we
do
go
on.
we
wouldn't
be
content
with
that,
but
i
wanted
to
make
that
point
first.
after
discussing
that
a
little
farther,
then
i
shall
go
on
and
argue,
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
that
we
were
entitled
to
judgment
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
plus
a
few
other
specific
facts
and
that
what
we
say,
i'll
elaborate
it
later,
but
what
we
say
essentially
is
that
given
the
conditions
that
existed
in
this
case,
and
i
shall
generalize
them
because
we
would
say
given
the
same
conditions
in
any
case,
then
the
probabilities
that
either
would
go
in
or
both
would
go
in
are
high
enough
so
that
the
public
is
better
protected
relying
on
the
free
interplay
of
the
market
than
it
is
by
allowing
these
two
people
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
basic
forces
that
are
the
foundation
of
our
theory
of
a
free
enterprise
economy.
now,
i've
--
i
hope
i've
said
enough
to
carry
us
ahead.
i
shall,
of
course,
have
to
discuss
the
problem
of
probabilities
in
much
more
detail
as
i
go
along,
but
at
the
moment
as
i
say,
i'd
say
that
at
worst,
we
were
at
least
entitled
to
show
that
here,
there
was
a
probability
that
one
would've
gone
in
because
while
that
would've
been
the
same
situation
as
if
olin
--
as
if
penn-olin
went
in,
you
still
would
have
the
additional
advantage
of
the
additional
competitor
--
the
additional
potential
competitor.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
judge
refused
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
perhaps
shouldn't
have
said
allowed
to
show.
there
was
no
finding
upon
the
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i
doubt
that
we're
entitled
to
claim
that
that
was
a
finding
in
our
favor.
if
it
was,
then
i
think
i'm
home,
but
i
take
it
that
what
he
really
was
doing
was
making
an
assumption
and
saying
that
this
is
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that's
all
i
could
--
can
fairly
claim
with
that.
perhaps,
he
would've
found
it.
this
was
an
unusual
opinion
in
one
respect
because
instead
of
deciding
who
was
going
to
win
and
then
finding
all
the
facts
against
the
other
party,
the
judge
seems
really
to
have
faced
the
fact
and
tried
to
apply
the
law
to
them.
it
makes
the
case
a
lot
easier
to
discuss
even
if
he
was
wrong.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
haven't
read
the
briefs.
it
certainly
urged
it
in
essence,
i
think.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
mean
by
--
by
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
any
interference
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
went
that
far,
we
certainly
don't
press
the
position
now
that
any
joint
venture
is
a
violation
of
section
7
or
section
1.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
it
put
in
a
great
deal
of
evidence
on
that
point
because
the
record
is
filled
with
evidence
bearing
upon
the
probability,
we
said,
that
these
companies
would
either
or
both
have
gone
into
this
market.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there's
certainly
some
things
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
suggested
that
but
we
wouldn't
say,
for
example,
that
two
weak
companies
here,
each
unqualified
to
go
in
and
compete
alone
in
this
market
and
demonstrably
so,
would
be
a
violation
of
section
7
and
section
1.
we
think
there
must
be
some
further
examination
than
that.
jumping
--
jumping
ahead
a
little
bit
once
more,
we
suggest
that
where
four
--
barely,
three,
i
suppose,
though
i
list
them
as
four
conditions
are
met,
then
at
least,
i
don't
--
i
say
this
is
a
minimum
standard,
not
the
full
requirement,
then
at
least,
section
7
and
section
1
forbid
the
combination.
i
would
say
first,
an
expanding
attractive
market
in
which
there
are
few
competitors.
second,
that
each
company
will
be
engaged
in
that
line
of
commerce
or
a
closely
related
line
and
that
it'd
be
fully
equipped
in
terms
of
financial
resources,
technological
qualifications,
commercial
context
and
experience
to
go
into
it.
third,
that
if
each
has
demonstrated
some
sign
of
interest
in
going
into
it,
then
the
probabilities
on
the
average
that
either
both
will
go
in
or
that
one
will
go
in
while
the
other
remains
on
the
sideline,
are
sufficiently
great
under
the
ordinary
operation
of
market
forces
that
these
laws
that
are
intended
to
prevent
people
from
interfering
with
the
operation
of
market
forces
come
into
play
and
it
should
be
found
that
the
combination
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
that's
the
full
range
of
our
argument.
as
i
say,
i
was
back
on
the
smaller
point
that
they
--
they
really
both
go
along
together.
let
me
direct
myself
for
a
little
bit
longer
to
the
matter
of
the
importance,
all
other
things
being
equal,
of
insisting
upon
the
arrangement
where
there
is
one
potential
entrant,
olin
or
pennsalt,
still
on
the
sidelines,
if
the
other
goes
in
as
penn-olin
did.
a
few
examples,
i
think,
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
elimination
of
such
potential
competition
is
an
improper
lessening
of
competition.
but
suppose
that
in
this
case,
for
example,
that
olin
had
gone
to
pennsalt
and
said,
“well,
you're
thinking
of
building
in
the
southeast.
we're
thinking
of
building
in
the
southeast.
we
should
both
go
in,"
that
would
be
murder.
"you
go
in
and
build
your
plant.
"olin
goes
to
pennsalt,
“build
your
plant
at
calvert
city
and
we'll
agree
to
stay
out
for
50
years
and
let's
have
an
end
to
the
matter
or
if
you'd
like
it
the
other
way,
we'll
build
our
plant
at
chattanooga
and
you'll
agree
to
stay
out
for
50
years
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
"i
take
it
that
such
an
arrangement,
if
entered
into,
perfectly,
plainly
would
be
one
which
may
lessen
competition
and
which
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
and
i
take
that
nobody
would
say,
"well,
you've
got
to
show
what
are
the
chances
that
both
would
go
in
next
year
or
the
year
after.
"that
that
wouldn't
even
be
a
legitimate
subject
of
inquiry
nor
that
you'd
appraise
the
relative
merits
of
the
two
competing.
well,
here,
the
arrangement
has
exactly
that
same
effect
on
potential
future
competition.
it
eliminates
the
additional
possible
entry,
not
this
year,
but
5
years
ahead,
10
years
ahead,
whenever
it
may
come
about
or
take
a
second
case.
suppose
we
--
we
hear
a
good
deal
of
talk
down
about
the
possibility
of
a
turbine
motor
in
an
automobile.
let's
suppose
that
putting
such
a
car
on
the
market
for
widespread
use
would
involve
the
construction
of
a
new
plant
in
a
radical
redesigning
of
the
chassis
and
body,
can
there
be
any
question
but
that
if
ford
and
general
motors
combine
to
set
up
a
subsidiary
to
enter
that
market,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
section
7
and
also
section
1?
i
think
not.
well,
now,
you
may
say
that's
not
entering
a
geographical
market
but
suppose
that
--
to
take
one
last
illustration,
suppose
that
atlantic
swimming
pool
company
had
a
new
prefabricated
swimming
pool
that
it
started
marketing
in
the
east
and
was
gradually
spreading
to
the
west
but
hadn't
yet
entered
the
mississippi
valley,
and
that
pacific
swimming
pool
company,
an
independent
concern
with
its
own
prefabricated
swimming
pool,
is
doing
the
same
thing
for
the
west
coast.
i
take
it's
perfectly
plain
that
they
couldn't
divide
the
pacific
valley
or
that
one
couldn't
agree
to
go
in
while
the
other
stayed
out
or
that
they
couldn't
set
up
a
joint
subsidiary
to
go
into
that
geographical
matter
as
long
as
each
was,
at
least
one
each,
was
equipped
to
do
it
by
itself
and
had
an
interest
in
doing
it
by
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course,
they
don't
--
they
don't
meet
some
of
the
conditions
i
stated
and
therefore,
i
--
that
would
be
a
harder
case
and
i
take
it
if
neither
is
presently
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
that
the
likelihood
that
they
would
go
in
independently
may
not,
i
hesitate
to
commend
myself
too
categorically
but
may
not
be
sufficient.
i
would
think
it
quite
plain
if
two
much
smaller
steel
companies,
mr.
justice,
got
together
for
the
purpose
of
entering
the
market
and
leaving
out,
i
now
see
good
reason
for
the
caution,
leaving
out
problems
of
vertical
integration
preempting
possible
outlets
for
steel
and
such
that
i
don't
think
anything
i'm
now
saying
would
be
opposed
to
that.
no,
i
think
there
has
to
be
--
we
--
we
say
there
must
be
some
distinctions
here.
we
do
say
that
the
distinctions
should
be
based
on
objective
events.
and
my
argument
with
respect
to
these
narrow
first
objective
conditions,
i
should
say,
rather
than
events,
my
argument
on
this
first
narrow
point,
let
me
conclude
it
and
then
go
on,
is
that
this
case
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
hypothetical
illustrations
that
i
have
put.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
it
seems
to
me,
we
--
we
don't
--
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have,
except
for
my
geographical
one,
at
least
as
narrow
as
if
an
--
if
not
a
narrower
market.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
can
only
have
two
companies
in
the
southeast.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
just
two
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i'd
call
that
a
duopoly.
i
wouldn't
call
that
adequate
company.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
would
say
the
same
thing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
expect
the
court
to
say
the
same
thing,
if
there
were
two
--
if
there
were
two
turbine
motor
manufacturers
in
the
motor,
i
wouldn't
---
mr.
archibald
cox
--
think
would
it
--
i
wouldn't
think
it
would
affect
it
yet.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
know
whether
that
doesn't
make
the
example
less
objectionable
than
this
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there
at
least,
there
would
be
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
would
still,
if
the
line
of
commerce
is
automobiles,
they
would
still
be
in
competition
with
auto
--
in
automobiles.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
if
that
is
objectionable
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
olin
has
been
found
fully
equipped
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
has
never
sold
sodium
chlorate.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
had
been
selling
many
related
lines.
it
had
had
vast
experience.
indeed,
it
had
developed
a
process
for
the
use
of
this
sodium
chlorate.
its
chemical
division
reported
to
management
that
sale
of
sodium
chlorate
is
an
essential
integral
part
of
this
company's
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
had
to
--
they've
decided
that
they
should
divide
it
some
way.
indeed,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
misfortunes
here
is
that
olin
had
been
carrying
on
experimental
work
on
a
new
type
of
electrolytic
cell
which
it
was
expected
would
reduce
the
cost
of
manufacture
below
anything
now
known
and
as
soon
as
the
merger
came
about,
they
issued
instructions
to
drop
that
further
experiment
and
development.
i
think
that
while
it's
true,
they
weren't,
either
to
a
large
extent,
selling
sodium
chlorate
in
the
southeast,
they
both
were
found
on
overwhelming
testimony
to
be
well
equipped
to
do
it
and
it
was
plainly
a
natural
development
of
their
existing
business.
i
don't
think
you
could
just
take
the
line
of
commerce
and
then
say,
"we're
going
to
shut
our
eyes
to
everything
else
that
surrounds
that
line
of
commerce
or
to
everything
else
that
company
is
doing.
"it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
--
be
very
different
from
a
steel
company
coming
in
and
doing
what
olin
did
here.
let
me
go
on
to
the
point
i've
already
mentioned
that
we
think
we're
entitled
to
judgment
on
these
facts
and
try
and
explain
the
reasoning
in
a
little
more
detail.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
findings,
on
the
findings.
we
take
plus
one
or
two
facts
which
aren't
and
can't
be
controverted
but
essentially,
mr.
justice,
on
the
findings.
as
i
suggested,
we
think
that
where
there
is
or
where
there
are
two
firms
available
to
enter
an
expanding
market
in
which
there
are
few
sellers
and
attractive
opportunities
and
where
those
firms
are
both
fully
equipped
to
enter
the
market
interested
in
doing
so
as
an
extension
of
an
existing
line
of
business,
that
then,
any
combination
between
them
violates
section
7
and
section
1
because
it
forecloses
too
good
a
prospect
that
both
might
enter,
then
or
in
the
very
near
future
or
that
one
might
enter
while
the
other
remained
a
potential
or
--
while
the
other
remained
a
potential
and
perhaps,
later,
an
actual
entrant
into
the
field.
now,
the
way
that
i
reasoned
it
out
is
--
is
this.
given
such
a
situation,
as
has
been
suggested
by
several
members
of
the
court,
there
are
several
possibilities.
you
could
add
variations
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
four
main
possibilities.
one
is
that
both
companies
will
enter
the
market
in
the
near
future.
the
second
is
that
one
will
enter
while
the
other
remains
a
potential
entrant
if
conditions
ever
warrant.
the
third
is
that
the
two
may
combine
to
enter
and
the
fourth
is
that
nobody
may
enter
at
all.
now,
obviously,
the
desirability
of
those
possibilities
ranked
in
the
order
in
which
i've
stated
it.
from
the
standpoint
of
a
competitive
economy,
the
best
would
be
the
first.
it
would
be
a
good
deal,
better
than
the
second.
the
second,
as
i
have
been
arguing,
would
be
a
great
deal
better
than
the
third
and
the
third
is
better
than
the
fourth.
indeed,
the
fourth
is
best
only
if
none
of
the
others
will
come
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
would
be
one
waiting
in
the
wings
and
in
this
case,
and
i
mean
to
emphasize
and
carry
through
everything
i
say
in
the
qualifications,
in
this
case,
either
was
fully
equipped
to
go
in
alone.
you
get
an
entirely
different
problem
if
one
or
both
of
the
two
that
combined
isn't
equipped
to
do
it
alone
but
that's
not
the
fact
here.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
yes,
the
record
doesn't
show
much
about
that.
of
course,
that
bears
on
all
these
probabilities
because
if
there
are
others
waiting
in
the
wings,
there's
even
less
to
be
said
for
the
joint
venture
because
you're
not
going
to
be
left
with
this
duopoly.
i
mean,
it
bears
on
that
one
as
well
as
on
the
other.
the
record
doesn't
show
much
about
this.
so
far
as
i
can
judge,
those
actually
in
the
wings
at
the
time
that
this
was
being
considered
were
these
two,
plus
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
which
is
usually
identified
in
the
record
by
its
subsidiary
as
columbia
southern
but
they
are
the
two
--
one
and
the
same,
as
i
understand.
mr.
archibald
cox
which
now
has
built
the
plant
and
then,
there
was
virginia
chemical
or
virginia
something
company
that
i
find
talked
about
in
some
of
the
documents.
there
must
have
been
other
companies
that
could.
we
argued
in
the
district
court
that
there
were
rumors
that
there
were
a
number
of
others
but
we
never
were
able
to
prove
it,
so
that
i
don't
purport
to
be
stating
anything
precise
but
just
as
to
suggest
the
general
outline
of
the
picture.
now,
of
course,
we
can't
always
have
our
(inaudible)
and
nobody
can
control
which
of
these
four
possibilities
will
be
the
one
that
eventuate.
i
suppose
that
ideally
then,
what
one
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
estimate
in
every
case
the
statistical
degree
of
probability,
then
apply
that
statistical
degree
of
probability
to
whatever
value
we
put
on
the
--
each
of
the
various
possibilities
and
strike
a
balance
as
to
which
was
the
wisest
course
to
follow.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
everyday
world,
however,
we
have
to
get
along
with
the
tools
we
have.
there's
no
way
that
you
can
measure
with
statistical
accuracy
the
degree
of
probability
in
each
case
and
there's
no
way
that
you
can
put
a
mathematical
value
on
each
of
the
potentialities
in
order
to
apply
the
mathematical
probability
to
it.
certainly,
testimony
after
the
event
is
not
in
general,
likely
to
be
very
helpful.
for
one
thing,
it
would
obviously
be
self-serving.
there
will
have
been
a
combination
and
with
the
best
of
goodwill,
the
corporate
officials
will
be
testifying
in
defense
of
what
they've
already
done
in
that.
it
would
also
be
highly
speculative
because
the
decision
that
the
corporate
officer
normally
faces
isn't
whether
he
will
go
in
alone
or
stay
out
alone.
he
also
has,
overhanging
all
the
consideration,
the
possibility
of
the
combined
ventures.
this
is
very
clearly
shown
by
the
fact
that
pennsalt
kept
saying,
"well,
it
seems
unlikely
that
we'll
go
in
alone
but
it'll
be
awfully
good
if
we
could
get
olin
to
go
along
with
us.
"and
then
nothing
would
come
into
going
along
together
and
they'd
talk
about
going
back
and
going
it
alone.
the
district
judge
took
note
of
this
and
said
that
in
fact,
the
officer
doesn't
face
the
question,
which
we're
trying
to
estimate
probabilities
on
here,
because
he
considers
all
three
and
he
always
will
in
the
case,
where
one
is
challenging
a
combination.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
under
these
circumstances,
that's
what
is
needed
is
some
statement
of
the
objective
market
conditions
under
which
the
probabilities
that
both
will
go
in
or
either
will
go
in
while
one
remains
on
the
sidelines,
are
good
enough
to
say
that
the
combination
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
and
it's
that
that
brings
me
to
saying
at
least
as
a
minimum
rule,
that
where
you
have
the
conditions
that
i
have
stated,
then
at
least,
section
7
and,
i
think,
section
1
is
violated.
and
those
conditions,
you
will
recall,
are
first,
a
new
or
expanding
market
with
attractive
commercial
opportunity.
second,
that
there'd
be
--
that
the
two
firms
that
ultimately
combine
will
be
engaged
in
that
line
of
business
or
--
and
be
well
equipped
financially,
technologically,
in
terms
of
commercial
experience
and
so
forth
to
enter
the
market.
third,
that
they
have
expressed
some
interest
in
the
market.
and
fourth,
of
course,
one
needs
a
combination
in
order
to
have
anything
to
complain
about
even
though
that
doesn't
bear
on
the
degree
of
probability.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
all
those
conditions
are
indispensable.
it
may
be
that
the
government
would
advocate
a
stricter
rule
but
we
do
--
they're
satisfied
here
quite
plainly
and
we
do
say
that
at
least
when
they
exist,
either
in
this
industry
or
in
any
other,
that
then
there
--
the
combination
destroys
such
a,
i
don't
care
what
they
call
it,
a
probability,
a
likelihood,
a
possibility
but
a
good
enough
prospect
that
you
will
have
competition
between
the
two
firms
or
competition
with
one
--
between
--
with
one
in
the
market
and
the
other
a
potential
competitor
to
warrant
finding
that
they
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
policy
of
the
law
after
all
is
against
the
combination
of
firms
able
to
stand
on
their
own
feet
and
to
compete
with
rivals
including
each
other,
section
7
being
prophylactic
looks
ahead.
it
deals
not
with
the
immediate
present
but
with
the
structure
of
the
market,
so
with
the
review
--
with
respect
to
what
may
happen
in
the
future.
and
i
can't
help
noting
in
this
sequence
of
section
7
cases
that
we've
been
having
that
this
is
the
way
that
companies
look
at
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law,
in
order
to
deal
with
realities,
must
also
be
careful
to
project
itself
and
not
think
--
simply
to
think
today
or
tomorrow
and
it
would
seem
that
where
those
four
conditions
are
met,
then
there
is
a
sufficiently
high
degree
of
probability
that
nobody
cannot
say
just
what
it
is,
that
the
market
wouldn't
get
nothing
and
that,
therefore,
the
combination
may
substantially
lessen
competition.
now,
here,
the
conditions
were
met.
the
southeastern
market
for
sodium
hydrochloride
was
exceedingly
attractive
for
new
investment.
between
1950
and
1960,
the
national
consumption
of
sodium
chloride
had
quadrupled.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
used
primarily
in
the
paper
industry
as
a
bleaching
agent.
it
has
some
agricultural
uses.
pennsalt's
sales
department
or
commercial
development
department
had
been
experimenting
with
the
notion
of
using
it
in
the
--
for
textile
bleaching
and
it's
rather
interesting.
you'll
find
in
our
brief
that
we've
quoted
some
excerpts
from
the
sales
manager
saying,
"well,
let's
not
go
too
fast
on
this
until
we
find
who's
going
to
do
the
selling
here.
if
olin
is
going
to
do
the
selling,
there's
no
use
our
--
docking
ourselves
out
trying
to
develop
it.”
mr.
archibald
cox
i
couldn't
tell
you,
mr.
justice.
when
it
first
entered
the
market,
it
has
become
important
during
the
1950s
and
the
projections
are
for
a
constantly
growing
market.
in
fact,
the
projections
for
the
demand
in
1964
as
projected
in
the
late
1950s
were
9000
tons
in
advance
of
what
the
--
in
excess
of
what
the
capacity
now
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
colleagues
tell
me
that
i
spent
42
minutes
arguing
about
the
wrong
chemical.
the
situation
isn't
quite
as
bad
as
that
sounds.
i
spoke,
apparently,
on
several
occasions
about
sodium
hydrochloride.
the
chemical
we're
concerned
with
is
sodium
chlorate.
whether
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
sodium
hydrochloride,
i
don't
know.
i
couldn't
possibly
tell
them
apart.
i
should
have
said
sodium
chlorate
on
all
those
occasions.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
leave
you
to
interpret
that
observation,
your
honor.[attempt
to
laughter]
second,
i
would
like,
in
an
effort
to
pull
together
what
i've
been
saying
thus
far,
to
stand
off
a
little
and
examine
from
a
distance
this
problem
of
what
should
the
antitrust
rule
be,
what
is
the
application
of
the
statute
where
two
firms
are
thinking
of
entering
a
market
in
which
neither
of
them
has
previously
been
engaged
and
then
they
combine
for
the
purpose
of
entering
it,
and
i'm
thinking
of
two
firms
who
could
clearly
go
it
alone.
now,
one
possibility
is
to
say,
well,
neither
of
them
was
there.
any
entry
is
no
competition
and
we'll
let
them
do
as
they
please.
this
seems
to
me
to
turnover
to
businessmen
the
opportunity
to
determine
for
themselves
how
far
the
normal
economic
laws
governing
a
free
enterprise
economy
will
be
permitted
to
operate
in
new
geographic
or
new
technological
markets
and,
i
suggest
that
it
would
come
very
close
to
meaning
that,
while
we
might
keep
what
competition
we
have
with
respect
to
old
products,
in
old
geographical
areas,
we
really
would
have
very
little
opportunity
of
preserving
a
free
market
in
--
where
new
technologies
develop.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
question
of
the
relief
was
put
to
one
side,
the
ultimate
--
the
first
request
was
for
temporary
injunction
and,
ultimately,
it
would've
been
to
require
some
kind
of
disposal
of
this,
but
there
was
no
evidence
offered.
there
was,
apparently
--
as
i
read
the
record,
there
was,
apparently,
some
kind
of
a
stipulation
that
neither
side
would
put
in
testimony
on
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
there
were
a
number
of
possibilities.
one
would
be
to
require
one
company
to
buy
out
the
other,
leaving
it
to
them
which
did
the
buying.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
justice
stewart
said
what
i
think
were
the
possibilities.
i
said
one
was
to
let
--
require
either
to
buy
out
the
other
or
to
let
them
sell
off
the
property
to
a
third
or,
conceivably,
in
some
other
fashion,
dispose
of
the
shares
of
pennsalt.
mr.
archibald
cox
penn-olin.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
plants
there
and
we
certainly
--
i
assume
we
would
hate
to
see
the
plant
torn
down.
mr.
archibald
cox
but,
it
seems
to
me,
there
are
plenty
of
ways
to
free
at
least
one
of
these
companies
to
come
into
the
market
later
if
it
wishes,
which
is
the
important
thing.
now,
i
was
attempting,
as
i
say,
to
stand
off
and
to
suggest
what
are
the
possibilities
here
but
one
is
to
leave
the
whole
matter
to
private
agreement
wherever
you
have
a
new
geographical
or
technological
area.
the
second,
which
seem
to
me
to
be
--
to
attempt
to
estimate
these
probabilities
in
every
individual
case
and
to
apply
some
general
adjective
deprivable
enough
and
then
tell
district
courts
to
make
a
finding
on
that
because
no
finding
was
made
on
it
here.
the
third,
which
i
was
trying
to
suggest,
was
that
whenever
the
conditions
that
i
stated
exist,
as
they
plainly
do
in
this
case,
although
i
haven't
devoted
myself
much
to
the
fact,
then
the
prospect
that
more
active
competition
will
be
foreclosed
by
the
combination
are
truly
very
real.
i
don't
suggest
that
anybody
can
measure
the
probabilities
accurately.
but,
in
most
cases,
given
an
attractive
market,
given
few
suppliers,
and
i
wouldn't
call
this
a
competitive
market,
it's
just
two
companies,
given
few
suppliers,
that
two
other
companies
engaged
in
substantially
that
kind
of
business,
interested
and
well
equipped
to
enter
then,
you
have
a
significant
chance,
perhaps
not
a
probability,
the
district
judge
found
not
a
probability
here,
but
a
significant
chance
they'll
both
go
in.
after
all,
there
were
two
new
entrants
in
this
market,
one,
the
combination
and,
the
other,
pittsburgh
plate
glass.
mr.
archibald
cox
had
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
was
marketed
--
i
was
somewhat
elliptical.
it
was
--
part
of
that
was
marketed
through
olin.
they
had
a
marketing
agreement.
pennsalt
manufactured
on
the
west
coast
and
olin
marketed,
not
all,
but
i
think
some
of
that
before
--
mr.
archibald
cox
just
prior
to
the
joint
venture,
yes.
and,
of
course,
pennsalt
was
making
this
chemical
on
the
west
coast.
it
had
50%
of
the
west
coast
market.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall
the
figure.
i'm
sorry.
the
market
has
continued
to
expand
and
penn-olin,
i
feel
very
sure
in
saying,
has
some-tens
of
thousands
of
tons,
but
i
don't
really
know.
while
you
have
--
may
have
a
significant
chance
that
both
will
go
in,
that
certainly
shouldn't
be
disregarded,
you
have
a
much
greater
chance,
i
would
think,
that
it
was
merely
always
a
probability
that
one
would
go
in
and
having
a
very
few
companies
in
the
market,
the
potential
competition
is
all
the
more
important.
now,
of
course,
the
argument
that
you
have
in
these
probabilities
rests
upon
the
basic
theory
of
a
competitive
economy
that
potential
suppliers
will
come
forward
to
meet
the
demand
when
the
price,
other
market
conditions
offer
an
opportunity
for
profit,
provided
only
that
combinations
and
restraints
of
trade
are
eliminated.
the
combination
of
two
companies
in
a
condition
such
as
this
interferes
with
the
operation
of
those
normal
market
forces.
the
theory
of
section
7
is
that
the
forces
will
work
out.
here,
given
the
postulated
conditions,
there
is
a
very
great
likelihood
that
they
will
work
out
and
it
follows,
we
submit,
that
any
combination
involving
an
inter-corporate
stock
acquisition
should,
therefore,
be
found
under
those
conditions
to
--
to
be
one
which
may
substantially
lessen
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
the
other
point
that
is
raised
by
way
of
defense,
one
that
the
district
court
didn't
consider,
is
the
argument
that,
since
penn-olin
was
a
brand
new
company
and
since
section
7
applies
to
acquisitions
of
stock
of
companies
engaged
in
commerce,
penn-olin
was
brand
new
and
wasn't
engaged
in
commerce
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
violation.
we've
dealt
with
that
in
our
brief.
we
submit
that
"engaged
in
commerce"
is
simply
an
adjective
intended
to
describe
those
corporations
that
are
subject
to
federal,
as
opposed
to
state
jurisdiction
and
that
any
effort
to
make
this
depend
on
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
with
relation
to
the
exact
moment
of
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
and
the
exact
moment
when
you
make
your
first
shipment
in
any
interstate
commerce
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel,
at
the
beginning
of
their
argument,
stated
that
it
had
been
their
understanding
that
the
issue
is
clearly
drawn
in
the
lower
court
and
in
this
court
up
until
the
oral
argument
today
that,
previously,
they
had
understood
it
to
be
that
what
must
be
compared
was
the
competitive
situation
as
it
existed
before
the
combination
with
the
competitive
situation
as
it
existed
after
the
combination.
now,
we
agree
that
that
is
the
question.
indeed,
i
think
that
i
have
been
addressing
myself
to
that
question
all
along.
the
problem
is
to
be
sure
what
one
means
about
competitive
situation.
by
"competitive
situation,"
the
district
judge
and
mr.
delone
apparently
mean
to
look
only
to
the
companies
who
are
actually
then
in
the
market
selling
the
product.
whereas,
by
"competitive
situation,"
we
mean
not
only
those
facts,
but
also
the
possibility
or
degree
of
probability
or
likelihood,
as
the
case
may
be,
that
other
companies
who
are
interested
in
this
field
and
capable
of
entering
it
may
now
or
in
the
future,
become
competitors
in
the
market.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
very
clearly
an
important
part
of
the
administration
of
both
section
7
and
of
the
sherman
act.
not
that
i'm
right
in
what
i
say
with
respect
to
the
district
court's
view,
it
appears
very
clearly
on
page
1576
of
the
opinion,
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
judge
steele
says
the
most
favorable
assumption
that
could
be
made
from
the
government's
standpoint
is
that
either
pennsalt
or
olin,
but
not
both,
would
have
entered
the
market
as
an
independent
competitor.
but,
even
this
hypothesized
situation
affords
no
basis
for
concluding
that
penn-olin
had
the
effect
of
substantially
lessening
competition.
whether
or
not
it
did,
depends
upon
the
competitive
impact
which
penn-olin
would
have
had
--
will
have
as
against
that
which
might
have
resulted
if
pennsalt
or
olin
had
been
an
individual
market
entrant.
the
government
argues
that
such
comparison,
that
is
the
effectiveness
of
one
of
those
in
the
market
as
against
the
other
party
in
the
market
is
irrelevant.
well,
we
agree
that
that's
irrelevant.
one
is
good
as
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
government
argues
that
any
such
comparison
that
is
between
penn-olin
and
the
market,
or
penn
and
the
market,
or
olin
and
the
market
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
is
irrelevant.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
saying
that
we
haven't
gone
back
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that
we
--
that
we
quite
agree
with
that,
but
that
what
the
judge
left
something
wholly
out
of
a
count.
he
left
it
out
of
a
count
that,
with
olin
in
the
market,
you'd
have
pennsalt
available
to
go
in
at
any
time
and
that
with
pennsalt
and
you'd
have
olin
available
to
go
in
at
any
time,
but
this
way,
you
have,
in
effect,
the
covenant
by
pennsalt
and
by
olin
that
neither
of
them
will
go
in.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
fact
that
they
were
there
--
would
be
there
ever
ready
to
go
in,
in
the
event
that
the
conduct
of
the
limited
number
of
firms
in
a
concentrated
industry
should
ever
raise
prices
or
otherwise
create
traditions
that
made
it
desirable
to
go
in,
gives
them
a
--
puts
a
limiting
factor
on
the
economic
power
of
those
concentrated
firms.
mr.
archibald
cox
partly,
we
do
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
the
--
i
would
disagree
on
that.
i
would
think
that
the
evidence
take
pennsalt
first.
here
is
a
company,
an
established
manufacturer
of
sodium
chlorate.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
are
the
other
facts.
here's
a
company
that,
for
10
years,
has
been
studying
this.
now,
mr.
delone
says
"well,
the
market
had
been
stagnant
for
10
years,
so
apparently,
potential
competition
doesn’t
amount
to
anything."
of
course,
the
market
had
been
stagnant
and
then
there
was
a
sudden
change.
why?
because
there
was
a
great
due
process
suddenly
developed.
there
was
a
demand
quadrupled
in
that
10-year-period.
the
projected
demand
doesn't
project
the
same
rate
of
increase
but
olin,
in
1958,
projected
that
the
market
would
be
77
--
the
--
other
than
captive
market
would
be
77,000
in
1960
and
105,000
in
1964.
that's
a
40%
increase
almost
in
five
years.
what
had
happened
was
this
new
oxidizing
process
for
the
pulp
and
paper
bill.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
a
forecast
all
in
made
in
1957
or
1958.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
so,
but
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
the
record
reference
is
874.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said
that,
in
1960,
it
was
not
a
deficit
market,
but
of
course,
what
he
was
comparing
was
the
added
capacity
of
these
new
firms
without
making
any
of
the
projected
inquiries
and
for
the
projected
inquiries,
we
rely
first
on
the
fact
that
it
had
been
growing
so
and
second,
upon
these
projections
by
olin's
and
others
like
arthur
d.
little
company
who
were
advising
pennsalt
and
olin
on
the
advisability
of
going
in.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
further
point.
it
was
suggested
that
our
argument
results
in
an
automatic
rule
that
would
condemn
all
combinations
to
enter
in
the
market.
i
suggest
that
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot.
i
heard
no
qualifications
in
mr.
delone's
argument.
it
would
indicate
when
firms
couldn't
combine
to
enter
a
market
in
which
neither
had
previously
been
selling.
whereas,
i
think
our
standards
recognized
the
need
for
some
selection
and
that
they
do
require
a
careful
examination
of
the
fact.
true,
not
as
subjective
intention
of
what
was
going
in,
in
somebody's
mind,
but
a
fact
you
can
take
hold
off,
of
the
capabilities
of
these
companies,
of
the
--
of
the
activities
that
they
had
been
engaged
in,
their
size
and
independent
qualification,
and
of
the
degree
of
their
interest.
and
it's
worth
noting
that
pennsalt,
which
had
constantly
been
studying
this,
one
of
the
last
minutes
of
the
corporate
directors'
meeting
recites
that
if
we
don't
go
on
the
joint
venture
then
dr.
somebody
who
was
in
charge
of
projecting
their
new
plant
will
report
again
on
the
possibility.
and
olin,
too,
had
this,
the
chemical
division,
pressing
hard
with
a
new
variant
proposed
of
their
plant.
they
were
going
to
put
in
there
with
the
reports
for
1960
which
never
came
forward
because
the
merger
had
the
combination
that
they
had
agreed
upon.
but,
we
do
look
at
those
four
facts
and
we
do
think
this
permits
a
discrimination
which
would
permit
companies
that
can't
go
in
alone
to
combine
and
enter
a
new
market
but
which
would
prevent
those
who
can
go
in
alone,
at
least
in
these
circumstances,
from
combining
and
thus,
covenanting
that
each
of
them
will
stay
out,
impliedly
covenanting,
so
as
not
to
compete
with
their
subsidiary.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
be
very
suspicious
of
any
such
fixed
corporate
policies.
as
this
record
here,
the
fixed
corporate
policy
of
these
companies
is
not
--
was
not
to
go
in
unless
you
have
a
certain
estimated
rate
of
return.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
never
made
any
exceptions?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
this
might
bear
on
something
akin
to
capability.
i
hear
the
words.
they
said
they
had
some
policies
but
i
also
noted
that
it
was
suggested
by
one
of
the
divisions
that,
well,
maybe
they'll
make
an
exception.
they
weren't
giving
up
upon
the
strength
of
the
policy
here.
i
would
be
a
little
hesitant
to
say
that
any
such
declaration
of
policy,
standing
by
itself,
were
conclusive.
i
think
not.
i
would
think
it
might
bear
on
the
question,
which
won't
always
be
easy,
of
capability
and
that
it
would
bear,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
on
the
question
of
interest.
now
of
course,
here,
we
have
clear
evidence
of
interest.
as
fixed
a
policy
as
you
seem
to
envisage,
might
mean
that
you
excluded
interest
from
the
case
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
different
from
the
case
we
have
at
bar.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
hesitate
to
go
any
farther.
