that's
all

justice

black
all
of
them
adjacent
to
the
river?
justice
hugo

black
they
try
to
reach
it?

(voice

(voice

i
thought
it's
columbus?
justice

south?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
--
was
the
amount
per
acre
given
for
their
land
the
same
as
to
each
plot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
they
using
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
farming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
take
the
fee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
that
because
i
wonder
what
is
the
relevance
of
your
argument
about
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
government
selling
this
information
method?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
know
precisely
how
commissioner
has
proceeded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
appoint
--
you
appoint
three
commissions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
they
agree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
appointed
from
--
from
the
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
when
they
start,
do
they
hear
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
take
witness
evidence
stenographically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
objections
in
the
--
objections
be
made
for
the
introduction
of
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
final
under
the
--
under
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
all
the
evidence
sent
to
the
--
the
court
when
it
finally
got
along
to
review
the
--
the
report
of
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
grounds
generally
does
--
can
the
court
set
aside
or
refuse
to
accept
the
findings
of
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
review,
suppose
they
are
adequate,
suppose
they
give
all
of
the
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
a
rational
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
they
can
--
the
commissioner
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
commissioner
lacks
a
rational
foundation?
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
find
out
just
a
moment
and
satisfaction
in
connection
with
this
because
it
seems
to
call
for
something
more
than
the
mere
interpretation
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
--
can
the
court
set
it
aside
on
the
ground
that
you
think
is
too
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
allowed
to
do
so
or
is
he
denied
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
--
you
mean
increases
or
decreases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
--
you
think
they
do
not
have
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
modify
to
what
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
modify,
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
modify
the
amount?
the
basic
thing
and
this
is
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
all
this
talk
is
about
what
they
actually
find,
can
the
judge
get
the
record
before
him
so
he
can
see
what
the
basis
of
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
the
court
of
appeals
give
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
have
it
in
this
--
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
entire
record
before
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
very
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
subscribe,
are
you
arguing
for
the
principle
that
in
order
to
make
findings
that
are
required,
the
submission
is
--
must
say,
"we
take
this
witnesses'
evidence
and
we
don't
believe
it.
we
don't
believe
this
part
of
(inaudible),
we
do
believe
this
other
part
of
the
witnesses'
evidence
and
after
we
get
all
through,
then
we
have
these
much
evidence
left
that
we
believe
and
on
it
therefore,
we
must
find
this
problem."
are
you
arguing
to
some
kind
of
findings
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
what
i
asked
you?
it's
required,
maybe
it
is.
it's
almost
as
easy
just
to
read
the
record,
wasn't
it?
well,
i
have
findings,
you
got
to
go
into
that
much
detail
but
the
witnesses
sometimes
--
of
course,
the
judges
have
no
judicial
argument
we
know
although
there
was
--
what
was
one
says,
"i
wanted
to
(inaudible)
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit,
there
was
a
judicial
argument
but
what
you're
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
that
--
that
take
of
each
witnesses'
testimony,
say,
"how
much
of
it
you
believe
and
don't
believe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
subsidiary
of
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
findings
of
subsidiary
facts
would
be
--
that
wouldn't
require
this
detailed
statement
about
what
the
witnesses
told,
would
it?
i
understand
by
subsidiary
facts,
there
are
a
number
of
facts
that
they
find
from
the
evidence
generally
and
then
on
those,
i
say,
you
reach
this
conclusion.
but
i
--
i
don't
know
just
how
far
it
seems
to
be
a
rather
difficult
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
decide
how
far
they
must
go
with
reference
to
the
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
never
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
those
words
myself,
as
--
and
holding
the
idea
that
you
had
take
out
the
witnesses
one
by
one,
say,
what
part
of
the
evidence
you
believed
and
didn't
believed.
