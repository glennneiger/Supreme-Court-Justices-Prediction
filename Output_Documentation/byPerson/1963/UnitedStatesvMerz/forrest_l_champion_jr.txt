mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
approach
this
argument
with
a
keenly
felt
sense
of
humility,
recognizing
that
despite
any
exhausting
effort
to
study
the
law
with
respect
to
the
issues
involved
in
this
case,
one
can
never
know
it
all
and
while
i
may
seem
categorical
or
firm
in
my
position,
nevertheless,
i
recognize
the
right
to
a
difference
of
opinion
and
a
difference
in
the
construction
of
the
rules.
i
approach
it
also
with
a
keenly
felt
sense
of
pride
that
this
court
considered
the
issues
involved
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
of
sufficient
import
to
justify
its
consideration.most
cases
are
decided
upon
their
facts
but
this
case
is
different.
it
depends,
we
submit,
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
we
respectfully
submit
the
integrity
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
at
stake
particularly,
rules
46,
51,
52,
53
7
--
and
71a
(h).
the
last
three
rules
are
specifically
involved.
rules
46,
51
and
61,
i
omitted
to
state
that
one,
are
incidentally
involved
if
we
construe
the
rules
together,
following
the
analogy
of
the
doctrine
of
pari
materia.
as
we
see
it,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
--
were
a
tremendous
advance
in
the
promotion
of
the
expeditious
trial
of
cases
upon
their
merits.
and
that's
the
reason
why
we
say
that
rules
46,
51
and
61
are
involved
--
incidentally
involved
because
they
reflect
the
rationale
behind
the
rules.
it
is
a
maxim
of
the
common
law
that
--
that
which
i
can't
quote
for
latin
but
i
can
say
that
it
is
a
maxim
that
is
well-recognized
and
that
is,
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public
that
there'd
be
an
end
to
litigation.
in
other
words,
the
person
is
entitled
to
a
trial
in
court
of
fair
trial
of
his
issues
but
he
is
not
entitled
to
continue
to
carry
on
litigation
when
he
has
an
opportunity
to
make
exceptions
and
apprise
the
trial
court
of
the
position
which
he
takes.
the
law
requires
--
due
process
requires
that
he
let
the
trial
court
know
with
the
first
opportune
time,
what
position
he
takes
with
respect
to
a
particular
matter,
so
that
the
trial
court
can
determine
the
merit
of
his
position
and
that
has
particular
application
here
because
under
rule
53
(e)
(2),
the
objector
to
the
findings
of
fact,
may
file
objections.
and
the
only
difference
in
our
position
between
the
government
and
us
is
this.
we
maintain
that
those
objections
must
be
specific.
the
government
agrees
that
while
rule
53
(e)
(2)
reads
may
and
seems
to
be
permissive
that
it
is
in
fact,
mandatory.
we
think
that
the
better
reason
authority
support
that
means.
our
only
difference
in
opinion
or
position
is
that
they
say,
it
may
--
the
objections
maybe
general,
we
say
they
must
be
specific.
they
must
be
sufficiently
specific
to
apprise
the
trial
court
of
the
position
taken
at
that
time,
so
that
the
trial
court,
if
it
deems
the
findings
of
fact
inadequate
in
any
particular
respect,
can
immediately
remand
it
and
the
commission
can
make
findings
of
fact
and
then
the
trial
court
can
review
the
commission's
findings
in
the
light
of
the
additional
findings
of
fact.
we
say
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
are
so
utterly
general
as
to
raise
no
question
for
review
and
that
question
is
tremendously
important.
that,
however,
is
a
procedural
question
under
rule
53.
the
other
question
that
is
involved
is
what
is
a
fact
under
rule
52?
the
government
takes
the
position
that
it
is
necessary
in
making
a
finding
of
fact
that
a
master
state
what
evidence
he
credited
and
what
evidence
he
dis
--
discredited.
and
the
fifth
circuit
went
along
with
that
position.
indeed,
that
is
the
crux
of
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
even
though
at
the
same
term
of
court,
the
fifth
circuit
rendered
a
--
a
decision
which
reads
to
our
way
of
thinking
that
altogether
differently,
cannot
be
reconciled.
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
cannot
be
reconciled
and
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
inaccurate
in
this
respect
and
i
--
i
therefore,
ask
the
court's
leave
to
quote
it,
in
order
that
i
might
be
accurate.
it's
a
very
short
quotation
and
since
it
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
same
term
of
court
and
is
so
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
position
taken
in
this
decision
appeal
from
that
i
read,
"where
the
only
issue
on
appeal
was
one
of
fact
and
the
reviewing
court
could
not
determine
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
approving
the
findings
of
a
special
master
were
clearly
erroneous,
judgment
would
be
affirmed."
that,
we
submit
to
you
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
decision
in
the
instant
case.
but
yet,
aside
from
that,
there
were
numerous
other
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
already
existent
at
the
time
this
appeal
was
held,
which
decisions
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
opinion,
studiously
avoid,
for
instance,
they
studiously
avoided
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
u.s.
versus
tampa
bay
garden
of
condemnation
case,
wherein
this
--
the
fifth
circuit
had
previously
held,
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
that
we
require,
in
applying
the
clearly
erroneous
doctrine,
a
special
finding
of
fact
with
reference
to
each
evidentiary
conflict
in
the
record.
now,
taking
the
government's
position
to
its
logical
extreme,
it
would
mean
that
a
master
would
have
to
take
each
witness
and
take
each
bit
of
testimony
to
which
he
testified
and
make
a
finding
with
reference
to
that
and
say,
"i
believe
this,
i
disbelieve
this,
i
believe
this
50%."
and
the
logical
extreme,
we
submit,
reduces
rule
53
(e)
(2)
and
rule
71a
(h)
to
an
absurdity,
destroys
the
utility
of
commissions.
and
whether
we
like
the
commissions
or
not,
it
is
a
part
whether
the
court
likes
commissions
or
not,
whether
a
litigant
likes
the
commissions
or
not,
it
is
part
of
our
federal
rule.
and
there
is
in
fact,
no
distinction
between
a
finding
--
a
report
by
a
master,
adopted
by
the
trial
judge
and
a
jury
verdict.
in
a
distinction,
we
submit,
particularly
as
applied
to
this
case,
is
one
without
a
difference
because
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
extensive
instructions
to
the
commission
in
this
case,
commencing
at
page
18,
outlining
all
of
the
basic
principles
of
law
to
the
commission
and
even
instructing
the
commission
that
if
they
desired
any
further
instructions
with
reference
to
any
question
that
might
come
up
before
them,
they
could
apply
for
--
further
instructions.
there
were
no
exceptions
to
these
instructions
by
the
government.
there
were
no
exceptions
to
the
reference
to
a
commission
by
the
government,
in
fact,
both
parties
asked
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance.
and
i
respect
--
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
question
of
reference
to
a
commission
was
not
involved
in
the
case
at
all,
even
though
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
laid
us
tremendously
to
try
to
justify
its
opinion,
referring
to
its
prosecutors
against
the
use
of
a
commission
in
a
condemnation
case
and
it
was
not
involved.
again,
the
opinion
seeks
to
assert,
impliedly
asserts
that
a
master
must
find
qualifications
of
witnesses.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
qualification
of
witnesses
is
not
a
fact.
it
is
a
preliminary
question
addressed
to
the
fact
finder.
one
other
thing
that
we
would
like
to
--
for
this
court
to
clearly
understand
and
that
is
this,
these
--
these
commissions
are
not
just
referred
--
they're
just
not
picked
out
of
thin
air,
they
were
--
they
were
referred
to
as
this
--
the
order
appointing
the
commission
in
this
case,
shows
they
were
referred
to
people
of
--
of
tremendous
ability
that
--
the
--
the
order
of
the
reference
says
that
he
is
an
experienced
attorney
talking
about
the
chairman
of
the
commission.
he
was
in
fact,
a
retired
superior
court
judge,
a
professor
of
law
at
mercy
university.
the
other
man
--
one
of
the
other
men
that
constituted
the
member
of
the
commission
was
a
real
estate
appraiser
from
columbus,
georgia
and
the
other
member
of
the
commission
was
a
gentleman
from
albany,
georgia
that
was
widely
familiar
with
land
values
in
this
particular
vicinity.
so
we
maintain,
respectfully,
that
once
the
trial
court
affirms
the
findings
of
a
master,
that
it
has
the
same
dignity
as
a
jury
verdict.
but
now,
let's
go
further.
look
at
the
reports
of
the
commission
made
in
this
--
this
case,
in
all
three
cases.
indeed,
the
report
of
the
commissioners
in
the
lindsay
case
is
found
at
page
32.
what
findings
were
made?
they
first
determined
the
highest
and
best
use
of
the
land.
they
next
determined
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
severance
damage
to
his
home
place
which
was
located
some
5
miles
from
the
property
that
was
condemned.
they
determined
the
value
of
the
land
taken
in
fee.
they
determined
the
value
of
the
(inaudible)
upon
the
land
not
taken.
they
determined
severance
damage
to
the
land
not
taken
and
then
they
concluded
that
the
landowner
was
entitled
to
the
sum
total
of
those
specific
items
and
they
concluded
in
that
conclusion
of
law
that
the
fair
market
value
of
land
governed
them.
now,
what
else
could
they
have
found,
unless
they
took
each
witness
and
said,
"i
believe
this
witness,
i
disbelieve
this
witness"
now,
there
maybe
some
complaint
and
in
all
candor,
i
must
take
to
the
court
that
there
were
some
comparable
sales
introduced
but
they
were
introduced
for
different
purposes.
the
government
into
introducing
comparable
sales,
introduced
sales
not
as
independent
evidence
of
value
but
as
a
means
of
buttressing
that
expert's
opinion
and
the
distinction
between
introducing
evidence
as
a
basis
for
an
expert's
opinion
using
hearsay
and
--
introducing
evidence
of
comparable
sales
as
independent
evidence
of
value
has
been
recognized
as
vital
because
one
stands
on
his
own,
the
other
one
is
only
as
a
basis
of
the
expert's
opinion.
looking
at
the
end
result,
in
all
three
of
these
cases,
as
the
ninth
circuit
stated
in
u.s.
versus
lewis
upon
which
the
fifth
circuit
placed
his
reliance
but
we
submit
very
improperly
so,
looking
at
the
end
result
in
this
case,
you
can
only
conclude
one
thing
and
that
is
that
the
commission
rejected
the
government's
witnesses.
they
did
not
answer
it
except
any
particular
witness.
they
arrived
at
their
own
independent
impression
of
value.
they
had
a
right
to
do
so
under
the
instructions
given
to
them
by
the
court
because
the
court
specifically
instructed
them,
"you
are
not
bound
by
any
particular
witness
nor
any
bit
of
evidence".
yes,
sir.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
were
submitted
to
us
immediately
after
they
were
given
to
the
commission
with
instructions
to
make
suggestions
to
the
court.
and
i
--?
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
sir?
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
were.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
did.
i
particularly
inquired
as
to
the
provision
of
the
instructions
casting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
--
on
the
landowner
because
the
rule
had
been
different
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rule
--
the
federal
rules
--
in
applying
the
federal
rules
to
the
condemnation
cases.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
no,
sir.
no
exceptions,
no
suggestion.
and
the
only
exceptions
made
after
the
awards
were
rendered,
were
these
general
objections
that
the
awards
do
not
show
the
basis
--
the
reports
do
not
show
the
basis
of
the
award,
do
not
show
how
the
conflicts
in
the
evidence
were
resolved.
for
the
rule
of
law
is
--
is
accepted
almost
universally.
moore's
federal
practice
cites
it
to
this
effect
that
if
from
the
facts
found,
an
inference
maybe
drawn
which
will
support
the
judgment,
they
will
be
so
drawn.
prior
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
had
accepted
that
readily.
but
this
decision
completely
ignores
it.
applying
that
principle
of
law
to
these
cases
and
looking
at
the
actual
findings
and
if
the
court
will
allow
me,
i
will
go
into
the
actual
testimony
in
each
of
the
cases
and
what
the
commission
found.
in
the
gavin
case,
the
range
of
testimony
as
to
the
865
acres
of
upland
was
$60
to
$85.
as
to
the
435
acres
of
river
land,
it
was
$83
to
$100.
the
government's
testimony
as
to
each
of
these
was
$35
per
acre
and
$50
respectively.
the
commission
returned
an
average
of
$81
per
acre.
the
commission
awarded
$4480
severance
damage
to
200
acres
which
had
been
split
up
into
four
tracks
by
which
of
the
taking
which
was
well
within
the
range
of
the
testimony.
we
introduced
five
comparable
sales
as
independent
evidence
of
value
ranging
between
$75
and
$111
or
an
average
of
86.
the
commission's
finding
recall
was
81.
now,
if
we
apply
the
rule
of
an
inference,
if
inferences
maybe
drawn
from
the
facts
found,
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
commission
gave
credit
to
the
--
all
of
that
--
testimony
including
the
comparable
sales
which
were
introduced
as
independent
evidence
of
value
making
adjustments.
now,
the
comparable
sales
are
not
ultimate
facts.
they
are
evidentiary
facts.
they
are
introduced
to
persuade
the
fact
finder
that
this
land
is
worth
so
much
because
this
particular
track
of
land
which
was
similar
to
this
instant
track
sold
within
an
approximate
time
for
a
certain
amount.
but
can
the
replies
that
we
recognize
that
sales
of
land,
no
two
pieces
of
land
are
alike.
and
it
is
up
to
the
fact
finder
in
much
the
same
fashion
that
he
weighs
opinion
evidence
to
make
the
numerous
adjustments.
now,
if
we
--
if
we
infer
from
the
facts
found
or
the
end
result
as
found
in
this
case,
we
will
conclude,
one,
that
they
rejected
the
government's
witnesses
because
instead
of
returning
an
average
of
$43,
they
returned
$81
per
acre.
we
will
conclude
also
that
they
gave
credence
to
the
evidentiary
comparable
sales
introduced
because
they
returned
$81
per
acre
and
the
average
of
the
comparable
sales
introduced
was
$86
per
acre.
you
can
follow
that
same
reasoning
as
applied
to
each
one
of
these
cases
and
conclude
if
we
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
u.s.
versus
lewis
that
the
commission
arrived
at
its
own
independent
examination
of
value
in
the
light
of
their
visit
to
the
land.
and
the
visit,
the
light
of
their
visit
to
the
land
is
something
that
is
given
tremendous
significance
by
the
appellate
court.
i
have
been
interested
in
following
the
cases
since
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
case
which
went
to
this
extreme
of
saying
that
you
must
state
what
evidence
in
words,
what
evidence
you
believe
and
what
evidence
you
disbelieve
in
order
to
comply
with
rule
52
and
53.
i
have
found
no
case
to
go
that
far.
i
have
found
several
cases
aside
from
u.s.
versus
lewis
stating
that
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
and
it
was
very
interesting
to
note
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
just
recently
published
in
lange
versus
liberty
national
324
f.2d
237
wherein
the
ninth
circuit
said
this
that
not
only
is
that
not
required
under
the
amended
of
rule
52
(a)
requiring
findings
of
fact
but
that
it
would
have
been
improper
to
have
so
found.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
just
plain
sensitivity
to
propriety
does
prohibits
the
requirement
that
a
fact
finder
stated
in
his
findings
of
fact.
i
didn't
believe
this
witness
because
i
thought
he
lied.
mr.

didn't

lange
versus
liberty
national
insurance
company
324
f.2d
237
and
particularly
at
241.
now,
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
"it
would
have
been
improper
for
the
trial
court
to
recite
the
evidence
which
had
led
it
to
the
conclusion,"
referring
to
the
petterson
lighterage
&
towing
corporation
case
which
is
the
chief
case
referred
to
in
the
advisory
committee
note
under
rule
52.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
so
earnestly
submit
that
it
is
not
just
a
matter
whether
this
court
affirms
or
reverses
this
judgment.
it
is
a
question
of
the
eroding
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
upon
the
--
the
uniform
application
and
interpretation
of
these
rules.
and
i
submit
to
you
--
the
court
that
if
it
will
read
as
we
have
sought
to
our
brief,
each
of
the
cases
referred
to
in
the
advisory
committee
note
under
rule
52
(a)
that
it
will
find
no
case
that
goes
to
this
extreme.
indeed,
the
emphasis
is
on
conciseness
ultimate
facts
rather
than
on
the
evidence.
and
also
it
seems
to
us
that
the
law
does
not
require
a
useless
thing
where
you
can
determine
from
the
in
result
as
found
what
was
credited.
a
court
does
not
have
to
come
out
and
say,
"i
didn't
believe
this
witness
because
he
was
evasive
on
the
stand."
now,
recall
this
too,
when
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
reviewed
this
matter,
he
had
not
only
the
detailed
findings
of
the
fact
and
the
recital
in
the
findings
of
fact
that
we
determined
the
value
to
be
from
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
they
stated
it
in
words.
now,
if
they
determine
this
to
be
value
from
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
they
--
the
only
logical
inference
that
you
can
draw
from
that
finding
is
that
they
didn't
particularly
discredit
or
any
particular
witness,
they
didn't
conclude
that
any
particular
witness
was
lying
because
after
all
really,
only
opinion
evidence
is
involved
and
everyone
is
entitled
to
an
opinion
particularly
and
there
--
there
is
very
little
required
in
--
very
little
that
is
necessary
to
qualify
a
witness
to
testify
the
value.
indeed,
the
law
recognizes
that
a
farmer
is
an
expert
as
to
farmland.
and
of
course,
in
these
cases,
these
awards
did
exceed
the
expert
witnesses'
opinion.
but
it
is
also
remarkable
that
the
fifth
circuit,
since
this
decision
was
rendered,
stated
categorically
that
not
only
is
it
not
error
and
it
--
no
deprivation
of
due
process
but
that
the
failure
to
follow
advice
of
experts
is
neither
perceived
denial
of
constitutional
rights
nor
even
error
which
maybe
corrected
on
direct
review
and
neither
military
or
civil
case.

had
no

there's
nothing
new
in
there.
but
it
is
a
positive
statement
of
a
universally
accepted
rule.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
yes,
sir.
323
f.2d

had
no
fault.
i
--
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
length
of
our
briefs.
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
the
seeming
elementary
nature
of
the
argument.
but
we
so
strongly
feel
that
the
integrity
of
these
rules
are
at
stake
in
this
case
and
we
also
strongly
feel
that
the
government's
request
that
a
new
trial
be
granted
is
a
very
unconscionable
request
when
particularly,
on
the
mere
suggestion
that
the
commissioners
may
not
be
available.
we
still
have
the
transcript.
the
commissioners
are
still
available.
the
land
has
been
covered
up.
but
that's
not
what
we
asked
in
this
court
to
do.
we
are
asking
the
court,
this
court
to
set
aside
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
because
we
say
as
a
manner
of
law
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
we
recognize
our
burden
to
prove
it's
clearly
erroneous.
but
we
respectfully
maintain
that
it
is
so
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
rules
that
it
should
be
set
aside
and
the
uniformity
of
the
--
of
the
federal
--
of
their
interpretation
and
application
of
the
federal
rules
maintain.

mr.
forrest

and
--
and
for
good
reasons,
because
in
the
gavin
case,
there
was
a
highway
number
435
(inaudible)
land
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
land
next
to
the
river
was
more
valuable.
the
land
north
of
the
river
was
sandy
and
therefore,
one
worth
as
much.
they
awarded
on
the
average
of
$81
an
acre
of
the
land
taken
there.
that
was
further
south
toward
george
--
toward
fort
gaines.
as
you
go
on
up
toward
georgetown,
we
ran
into
the
lindsay
case
which
had
some
of
the
best
farmland
in
the
country
and
the
transcript
should
--
so
show
because
the
bottom
land
down
there
was
good
to
farmland
as
it
is
in
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
they're
using
it
for
farming.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
grazing,
grazing
and
peanuts.
yes.
and
the
evidence
showed
tremendous
production
on
that
land.
and
the
other
land
was
located
within
the
outskirts,
part
of
it
within
the
city
limits
of
georgetown
and
improved
tremendously.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government's
testimony
was
that
it
was
over
improved
and
one
of
the
experts
for
the
government
said
in
a
--
one
of
the
track
--
the
houses
that
was
bringing
in
$35
an
acre,
i
mean
$35
per
month,
one
worth
anything
because
the
--
the
land
was
over
improved
and
that
therefore,
it
didn't
contribute
anything
to
the
market
value
of
the
land.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
$160
per
acre.
but
that
was
because
it
was
tremendously
improved
with
fences,
with
houses,
with
bonds
and
--
and
it
also
he
had
his
home
located
on
it.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
yes,
sir.
all
except
70
acres
left
--
purely,
it
was
the
poorest
land
left
and
it
only
was
good
as
--
as
they
found
in
the
findings
of
fact
that
it
was
good
only
for
the
growth
of
pine
trees
and
grazing.
and
it
was
multiple
--
little
times
on
it
and
it
was
inaccessible
also.
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i
beg
the
court
to
leave
to
--
to
distinguish
and
that
is
the
reliance
of
the
government
upon
these
appeals
from
administrative
agency.
and
i
say
to
you
--
the
court
that
we
think
we
detect
a
distinction
between
the
review
of
--
of
cases
wherein
injunction
was
granted
because
rule
52
expressly
requires
that
you
state
the
grounds
of
your
decision
where
the
extraordinary
relief
of
injunction
is
granted.
likewise
on
the
rule
8
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
says
not
only
findings
but
the
reason
then
basis
therefore.
and
--
and
there
are
two
--
there
are
good
reasons
for
that.
one
is,
and
it
was
clearly
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
burlington
case
decided
at
the
last
term,
one
is
that
congress
vested
in
the
administrative
agency
that
discretion.
and
in
that
particular
case,
a
choice
between
two
definite
remedies
was
involved
not
a
choice
as
between
believing
two
sets
of
witnesses
as
to
the
same
issue.
so,
naturally
is
--
more
detailed
findings
were
necessary
but
this
court
was
also
jealous
of
the
fact
that
it
did
not
encroach
upon
the
prerogative
of
the
administrative
agency
to
decide
and
exercise
that
discretion
as
vested
in
it
in
congress.
so
you've
got
--
but
there
is
one
other
thing.
due
process
is
inherent
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
due
process
is
not
necessarily
inherent
in
the
administrative
hearings.
and
it
is
the
province
of
this
court
and
this
court
had
jealously
regarded
the
right
to
see
that
due
process
was
done
in
administrative
agencies
so
as
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
our
government
and
to
maintain
the
--
the
object
of
the
congressional
legislations.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
no,
sir.
except
--
i
don't
see
that
due
process
is
involved.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
it
is
involved
is
the
fifth
circuit
was
--
was
wrong
in
stating
that
--
that
the
trial
court
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing
when
it
set
aside
these
detailed
findings.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
well,
this,
that
i
think
i
detect
a
requirement
in
the
decisions
that
findings
be
more
detailed
and
with
quite
a
bit
degree
of
collaboration
in
findings
made
by
administrative
agencies
as
compared
with
a
master.
i
don't
think
that
the
findings
of
a
master
need
to
be
as
detailed
because
rule
8
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
expressly
requires
a
detailing
of
the
reasons
and
bases
therefore
whereas
rule
53
(e)
(2)
says
that
the
finding
shall
be
made
only
if
required
in
the
order
of
reference.
and
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
did
require
findings
but
he
did
not
detail
the
nature
of
the
findings
to
be
required,
to
be
found.
and
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
for
the
government
to
have
state.
now,
you
haven't
made
sufficient
findings
as
to
these
evidentiary
sales
and
the
judge
could
have
referred
the
thing
back
to
the
commission
immediately.
these
findings
could
have
been
made.
we
could
have
had
a
review,
but
it's
not
necessary
that
all
of
this
detail
be
found
in
order
for
the
appellate
court
to
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
doctrine
because
prior
decisions
had
said
that
it
is
only
necessary
that
we
check
the
general
processes
of
the
court
below
in
order
to
determine
if
a
mistake
had
been
made,
if
there
had
been
a
clear
misapprehension
of
the
rule
of
law
applied
or
the
other
usual
rules
that
are
accepted
in
determining
that
a
decision
is
clearly
erroneous.
my
thanks
to
the
court.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we
understand
that
it
is
now
covered
up
because
the
water
had
coming
on
up
toward
columbus
now.
mr.
forrest
l.
champion,
jr.
i
think
we'll
soon
have
a
port
of
columbus.
thank
you,
your
honor.
