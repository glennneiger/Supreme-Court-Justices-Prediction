i
think
that
you
were
on
the
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
supposed
to
do
that
in
every
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
counsel
participate
in
preparation
of
instructions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
the
instructions
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
afforded
an
opportunity
to
make
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suggestion
as
to
the
instructions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
counsel
avail
themselves
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
government
counsel
make
any
suggestion?
justice

(inaudible)
clearly
erroneous,
as
i
understand
it,
so
this
is
treated
this
as
a
master
before
it
could
be.
the
district
court
which
appointed
the
commission
may
set
aside
the
valuation
finding,
may
it
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
it's
clearly
erroneous.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
--
may
it
--
they
discovered
it's
clearly
erroneous.
the
district
judge
take
a
record
and
say,
â€œthe
finding
of
$81
was
clearly
erroneous
but
on
the
record,
i
find
that
it's
$75."
may
the
district
court
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
whether
it
should
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
may
it
do
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
not
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
does
not
indicate
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is,
so
far
as
the
rule
is
concerned,
the
district
judge
could,
just
on
the
record
made
before
the
commissioners,
reduced
the
valuation
from
$81
to
$75.
just
--
just
seems
to
me
that
there
has
--
the
rule
--
rule
fairly
says
so,
otherwise
what
does
it
mean
that
the
district
judge
may
modify?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
the
question
is
whether
under
the
rule,
he
may
nevertheless.
