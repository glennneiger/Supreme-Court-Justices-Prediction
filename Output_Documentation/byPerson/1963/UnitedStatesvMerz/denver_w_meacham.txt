mr.
denver
w.
meacham
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
at
a
decided
disadvantage
as
a
country
lawyer
who's
concerned
with
these
people
in
this
particular
case
and
so
far,
the
discussion
has
had
to
do
with
the
broader
picture.
i
think
it
--
this
case,
of
course,
will
be
decided
according
to
the
rule
the
way
it
is
now
and
i
find
it
helpful
to
review
the
general
principles
just
very
briefly
that
are
involved.
our
mission
in
this
case
is
to
decide
the
just
compensation
to
these
particular
people
for
the
clearance
easements
that
were
taken
on
their
property
eight
years
ago
and
which
have
been
in
litigation
ever
since
that
time.
there's
no
dispute
that
we
arrived
at
that
just
compensation
by
taking
the
fair
cash
market
value
which
is
what
a
man
who
wanted
to
buy
this
property
would
pay
the
landowner
if
he
wanted
to
sell
and
which
is,
let's
face
it,
is
an
informed
estimate.
we
accrued
ourselves
to
some
degree.
it's
just
our
best
guess.
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do.
now,
the
rule
say
71a
(h)
says
that
this
court
authorizes
the
appointment
of
one
of
these
commissions.
the
rule
say
that
that
commission
will
try
the
facts
will
arrive
at
a
judgment
as
to
the
amount
of
what
they
find
and
that
the
appellate
court
will
--
and
that
the
district
court
will
approve
that
report.
if
there
are
no
objections
to
that
report,
if
that
report
is
clear
--
not
clearly
erroneous.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
logically
we're
at
the
point
in
this
case
where
we
determine
whether
the
facts
as
found
by
this
commission
and
the
law
as
found
by
this
commission
are
clearly
erroneous.
now,
another
thing
your
rule
says,
your
rule
says
that
if
an
objection
is
made
to
this
report
that
the
government
must
object
and
tell
the
court
of
what
the
objection
is.
in
this
case,
the
objection
to
the
government
as
to
the
report
which
originally
was
a
report
that
just
found
there
was
so
much.
in
this
report,
these
commissioners
which
were
composed
of
two
lawyers
and
one
real-estate
man
found
that
they
had
tried
this
case,
that
they
had
viewed
the
land
and
they
had
arrived
at
just
compensation
in
these
following
specific
amounts.
the
government
object
to
that
report
and
said
there's
no
specific
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
so,
the
commission
filed
another
report
and
in
this
report.
to
me,
they
--
they
tell
this
court
precisely
what
they
did.
they
said
the
highest
and
best
use
of
this
property
was
for
agriculture
purposes.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
no,
sir.
there
was
--
except
as
to
one
track,
there
was
some
sand
on
one
track
and
they
also
found
as
to
that
particular
track
that
--
that
we
were
wrong
and
that
the
highest
and
best
--
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
that
is
correct,
but
they
were,
justice
stewart,
detailing
the
steps
that
they
were
following,
which
is
just
what
the
government
wants
them
to
do.
there
--
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes
sir.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
that's
right.
they
--
they
gave
the
highest
and
best
use.
they
gave
--
they
said,
“now,
we're
going
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
the
difference
in
the
fair
case
market
value.
we
aren't
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
any
airplane
activity
above
the
ceilings
which
are
placed
on
this
line.”
they
said,
“we
did
not
feel
that
there
was
any
sufficient
proof
of
any
use
as
to
the
sand
on
two
of
the
tracts
involved
in
here.”
now,
the
government
now,
at
this
time,
says
this
in
their
briefs
in
this
court,
they
say,
“we
want
the
court
to
say
what
was
the
market
value
of
the
land
before
the
taking.”
in
their
objections
to
the
report,
here's
what
they
say.
the
reports
wholly
fail
to
make
specific
findings
as
to
the
facts
on
which
the
commission
based
its
evaluation
and
failed
to
show
how
they
applied
applicable
principles
of
law
to
the
facts
in
reaching
their
ultimate
conclusions.
the
reports
wholly
fail
to
show
that
all
comp
--
incompetent
and
inadmissible
testimony
was
disregarded.
the
reports
wholly
fail
to
show
how
controverted
testimony
was
resolved,
if
it
were,
in
arriving
at
evaluations
and
are,
therefore,
deficient
and
inadequate.
the
reports
taken
as
a
whole
amount
to
no
more
than
a
general
verdict
of
a
jury
since
no
specific
findings
of
any
controverted
issues
were
made,
the
only
specific
findings
being
as
to
those
matters
which
were
stipulated
to
by
the
parties
to
this
action.
therefore,
the
reports
are
wholly
inadequate
to
furnish
an
adequate
basis
for
you
by
the
trial
judge
or
an
appellate
court.
now,
our
contention
is
that
the
government
is
inconsistent.
the
government
in
the
report
that
the
commissioners
make
says,
“you
gentlemen
should
be
specific
and
explain
your
arithmetic.
you
should
explain
your
philosophy
as
you
reach
this
result.”
on
the
other
hand,
when
it
comes
to
objecting
to
the
report,
they
say
just
a
broad
objection
is
sufficient
and,
to
me,
that's
inconsistent.
the
notion
of
a
commission,
and
incidentally
the
government
has
always
objected
to
the
enactment
of
this
rule,
the
notion
of
a
commission
is
in
people
like
my
clients
who
live
100
miles
away
from
where
the
district
court
sets
whose
land
is
there,
that
this
commission
can
come
out
and
look
at
the
land
and
get
a
better
notion
of
it
and
thereby
expedite
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
now,
in
this
particularly
case,
the
fact
has
been
just
to
the
contrary.
we
have
people
with
a
total
award
of
$27,183
who'd
been
in
litigation
for
eight
years
when
their
property
was
taken
in
march
of
1956.
if
--
if
the
notion
of
the
rule
is
to
expedite,
then
the
government
at
the
time
it
accepts
to
the
reports
should
say,
“fellows,
why
didn't
you
say
the
before
and
after
market
value?
why
didn't
you
say
these
other
specifics
that
they
now
ask
for
the
first
time
that
go
in
this
report?”
if
they
had
have
asked
for
those
things,
the
commission
would've
supplied
them
and
that
would
all
be
all
there
was
to
this
case.
now
in
the
matter
of
the
report
itself
and
as
justice
goldberg
was
approaching
the
problem
a
minute
ago.
here's
the
picture
i
give.
i'm
a
commissioner.
i
try
this
suit.
the
landowners
testify.
in
this
case,
the
landowners
somehow
made
a
limit
of
their
50
years
and
just
because
they're
party
to
the
suit
doesn't
make
them
lawyers,
it
doesn't
make
them
completely
incompetent,
but
you
do
take
what
they
have
to
say
with
a
grain
of
salt.
the
landowners
testify,
mr.
wilcox
testifies,
the
government
has
an
expert
to
the
kansas
city
of
missouri
who
lives
500
or
600
miles
from
this.
he
testifies,
a
very
expensive
expert.
the
government
has
another
expert
testify.
you
have
these
various
experts
testify.
i
hear
this
testimony.
and
then,
i
get
out
and
i
look
at
this
land.
i
look
at
the
property
that
is
involved
in
comparable
sales
and
i
take
that
into
account.
and
then,
of
my
own
--
i
make
a
decision
as
to
this
value.
maybe
this
landowner,
i
say
he's
--
i'll
take
what
he
says
with
a
grain
of
salt
or
he
didn't
have
the
right
notions
about
it.
i
will
--
i'll
pay
10%
to
him.
i'll
pay
50%
to
him.
i'll
pay
30%
to
the
fact
i
viewed
the
property.
i'll
do
all
these
things.
well,
surely,
it's
not
necessary
for
the
commission
to
give
weight
to
these
various
things
that
entered
into
their
decision.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
felt
that
there
was
sufficient
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
to
enable
him
to
review
the
decision.
judge
phillips
and
judge
picket
and
judge
lewis
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
examined
these
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
they
felt
that
there
were
sufficient
things
that
would
make
it
possible
for
them
to
review
these
findings
as
to
the
amount
of
this
compensation
and
not
have
any
feeling
that
the
commission
grabbed
the
value
out
of
the
sky
or
anything
of
that
sort.
it
is
admitted
by
the
government
that
all
of
these
values
are
well
--
there
is
no
contention
that
these
values
are
excessive.
all
of
these
values
are
well
within
the
range
of
the
testimony.
it's
also
when
you
read
this
very
dull
looking
and
very
tiresome
record
which
is
an
imposition
on
you
gentlemen,
you
find
that
there
is
various
little
references
in
the
government
brief
that
things
that
the
commission
did
that
was
wrong.
for
instance,
they
said
they
took
the
testimony
of
the
authors.
you
find
in
this
record
when
you
read
it
that,
at
pages
74
and
118,
there's
only
two
references
of
authors.
one
of
them,
the
government
--
the
only
thing
involving
authors
was
--
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
if
the
court
please.
at
the
adjournment
yesterday,
we
were
talking
about
specific
items
of
evidence
which
the
government
felt
was
incompetent
that
was
allowed
to
go
before
the
commission
in
which
they
may
have
used
in
their
determination
of
just
compensation.
the
first
of
this
as
mentioned
--
mentioned
in
their
petition
but
not
mentioned
in
their
brief
and
it
has
to
do
with
offers.
the
government
contends
that
offers
were
introduced
in
evidence
and
they
may
have
been
used.
the
situation
with
regard
to
offer
is
at
page
74
of
the
record,
an
effort
was
made
to
prove
that
there
were
no
offers,
and
for
that
reason
there
was
a
depreciation
in
market
value.
there
was
no
longer
any
demand.
at
that
place
in
the
record,
the
court
sustained
the
government's
objection
and
no
evidence
was
entered
in
evidence.
again
at
page
118
with
respect
to
tract
124
(e),
the
witness
there
again
--
an
effort
was
made
to
prove
that
he
did
has
some
offers
prior
to
the
taking
of
the
easement
that
he
had
no
offers
afterwards.
no
dollars
and
cents
were
mentioned.
no
--
no
amount
was
mentioned.
it
was
merely
an
effort
to
show
that
there
had
--
there
was
a
decrease
demand
and
therefore
diminution
in
market
value.
at
that
place,
the
court
did
allow
that
evidence.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
would
in
no
way,
prejudice
the
commission
would
be
nothing.
there
were
no
dollars
and
cents,
nothing
that
would,
in
any
way,
color
the
finding
of
the
commission.
the
other
item
they
mentioned
both
in
their
petition
and
in
their
brief
is
the
managerial
skill.
the
government
felt
that
one
of
the
witnesses
took
into
account
managerial
skill
and
that
this
would
be
a
nontransferable
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
a
proper
item
to
base
just
compensation.
the
evidence
on
that
is
at
page
170
of
the
record
and
here
is
the
evidence
on
that.
the
evidence,
this
witness
testified
that
a
farmer
who
properly
farmed
his
farm
would
have
a
better
looking
farm
and
therefore
it
would
have
better
market
value.
our
used
car
lots
here
and
all
across
the
nation
are
examples
of
the
fact
that
when
you
shine
a
piece
of
property
up
it
does
have
an
increased
market
value.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
incompetent
and
that
in
no
way
colors
the
determination
by
this
commission
of
just
compensation.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry
for
the
misnomer.
he
wasn't
commissioned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
the
chairman
of
the
commission
was
an
attorney,
another
member
of
the
commission
was
an
attorney
and
they
rule
on
evidence
as
they
go.
in
this
instance,
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
two
instances
in
which
they
did
not
rule
on
the
evidence
and
in
their
findings
to
find
that
they
did
along
those
particular
items.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
i
think
the
--
the
objective
party
could
file
any
exception
and
specify
this
particular
specification
and
submit
that
argument
to
the
district
judge
when
he
makes
his
finding.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
sir?
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
no,
sir
and
there's
no
requirement
in
your
rules
that
any
of
them
--
the
attorneys,
i
think
the
practice
is
and
mr.
marquis
of
course
knows
much
more
about
what
the
practices
in
this
particular
case,
two
are
lawyers
and
one
was
a
real
estate
man.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes,
sir,
i
feel
that
the
report
should
be
sufficient
for
the
appellate
court
to
know
what
this
commission
did
but
i
feel
very
strongly
in
this
part
--
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes
sir,
in
this
particular
case,
that
these
reports
do
meet
that
rule.
now,
we
have
the
auxiliary,
the
ancillary
contention
in
this
court
that
the
government
should've
specified
the
particulars
in
which
they
felt
it
was
--
was
not
sufficient.
but
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
rule
that
the
appellate
court
should
know
to
have
sufficient
findings
of
fact
and
conclusion
of
law
to
know
what
this
commission
decided.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
no
sir.
i
think
we
rise
and
fall
unless
they
--
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes,
sir.
your
rules
have
--
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
that
is
correct.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
law.
that's
a
well
established
law
and
i
think
it's
a
very
good
law.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
yes,
sir.
i
do
quarrel
with
the
fifth
circuit
holding
in
the
case
that
follows
with
this.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
i
--
i
think
they
were
too
stringent
in
the
requirements
as
to
the
findings
of
fact.
mr.
denver
w.
meacham
they're
--
they're
general
principles,
i
agree
with.
their
application
of
those
principles
i
disagree
with.
i
--
i
find
no
fault
with
their
general
principles.
that
case
--
in
that
case,
they
relied
heavily
on
united
states
versus
lewis.
and
if
the
court
will
read
that
case,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief,
then
as
mr.
champion
has
stated
in
his
brief,
you'll
find
in
the
lewis
case,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
says,
"we
do
not
feel
it's
necessary
that
the
commission
find
how
they
treated
these
--
these
particular
elements
of
--
of
that
enter
into
the
ultimate
just
compensation
that
we
discussed
here
yesterday
in
our
brief.
you'll
find
that
in
lewis
case,
it
does
not
support
the
conclusion
that
the
fifth
circuit
reaches.
now,
there's
been
some
talk
along
this
line
that
we've
been
just
now
discussing
that
there's
a
great
difference
of
opinion
in
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeal
as
to
this
particular
manner.
now,
i
think
you'll
find,
as
i
did,
when
you
examine
these
cases
that
this
difference
of
opinion
is
more
imaginary
than
real.
their
only
difference
of
opinion
is
between
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
two
cases
that
you
have
before
you
today.
now,
all
of
the
other
cases
are
easily
distinguishable
because
complexities
enter
in
--
for
instance
there
--
there
might
be
a
question
of
severance
damage
which
there
wasn't
in
our
particular
case.
there
maybe
a
question
of
special
benefits
and
in
all
those
cases
was
the
--
upon
which
the
government
relies.
you
will
find
that
in
--
in
each
of
those
cases,
i
think
and
perhaps
all
of
them,
at
least
all
of
them
for
--
with
--
with
one
possible
exception,
the
commission
did
not
find
what
the
highest
and
best
use
was.
the
government
--
the
commission
did
not
find
how
they
treated
severance
damages.
the
commission
did
not
find
how
they
treated
the
problem
of
special
benefits.
now
our
case
is
a
very
simple
case.
it
has
none
of
these
complexities
that
enter
into
it
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
opinion,
as
given
by
the
tenth
circuit,
is
very
concise,
very
precise,
and
very
objective,
and
each
statement
in
that
opinion,
you
will
find,
is
under
guarded
with
a
citation
which
specifically
supports
that
conclusion.
now
on
the
other
hand,
with
all
due
respects
to
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
the
case
that
is
to
follow,
you'll
find
that
the
citations
there
do
not
support
the
position
the
court
takes
in
this
particular
case,
in
that
particular
case.
it's
our
contention
that
there
is
no
conflict
in
any
of
the
circuits
with
--
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
findings
of
fact
except
the
conflict
that
you
have
before
you
today
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
that
is
to
follow.
i
think
the
true
rule
as
justice
white
contented,
i
think
that
the
true
rule
is
that
you
take
each
particular
fact
situation
and
you
determine
it
on
that
basis.
and
you
do
not
lay
down
broad
general
principles
and
then
decide
each
case
on
those
principles.
i
think
each
case
varies
and
for
that
reason,
you
can't
reach
that
result.
i
do
think
as
it
happened
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
as
--
did
not
happen
in
my
case,
that
it
would
be
more
regular
if
the
district
court
when
he
appointed
the
commission,
gave
them
detailed
instructions
as
to
what
they
should
do
and
what
they
should
not
do
after
his
out-o-
pretrial
conference
and
in
that
conference,
determined
the
issues
that
they
will
be
faced
with
and
give
them
instructions.
i
think
that
would
be
the
better
--
better
practice.
but
the
fact
that
that
did
not
happen,
in
my
particular
case,
does
not
mean
that
these
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
are
sufficient
--
are
insufficient.
the
district
judge
was
able,
by
looking
at
our
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
to
satisfy
himself
that
--
that
he
knew
what
they
have
done
and
that
it
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
again,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
able
to
look
at
the
findings
of
fact
and
the
conclusions
of
law
of
this
commission
and
they
were
satisfied.
i
think
those
two
things
enter
into
the
question
and
tend
to
prove
that
these
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
below
were
sufficient.
i
appreciate
greatly
your
courtesy,
your
attention
to
these
cases.
i
sincerely
and
earnestly
urge
this
court
to
put
a
--
an
end
to
this
extended
litigation
that
has
gone
on
since
march
of
1956
for
none
at
all
amounts
of
just
compensation
that
has
been
fixed
for
my
people
has
become
purely
an
academic
matter
at
this
stage
because
of
the
extended
litigation
in
which
they
have
been
forced
to
extend.
i
thank
you
very
much.
