if
there
was
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
suppose
the
commission
and
actually,
the
company
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
normal
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
just
--
they
were
just
decided
that
there's
a
general
rule
that
the
finding
should
be
adequate
for
appellate
review
on
different
facts
and
different
cases
that
of
course
deal
--
it
might
--
might
come
out
of
the
way
to
look
just
(inaudible)
because
the
facts
are
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
master's
rule
doesn't
apply
to
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
may
not
modify
the
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
--
here,
but
the
--
may
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
additional
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
a
master
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
master's
rule
--
report
after
hearing
may
adopt
the
report
or
may
modify
it
or
may
reject
it
in
the
(inaudible)
impart
or
may
hear
and
receive
further
evidence
or
may
recommit
it
to
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
certainly
applies
to
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
in
any
--
it
doesn't
need
to
hear
anymore
evidence
in
order
to
modify
it
either.
he
can
do
it
on
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
mean
by
that
of
the
hearing,
what
do
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
it
isn't
complete?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
say
what's
wrong
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
ground
has
simply
had
been
given
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
go
--
you
didn't
go
that
far,
the
objection.
