chief

did
you
--
did
you
say
the

covered
up?

yes,
yes.

chief

(inaudible)
when
did
you
--
when
did
you
start
to
change
this
policy
of
amending
juries?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
last
two
year,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
that,
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
practically
all
the
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
--
in
a
case
like
the
hanford
--
hanford
condemnation
where
there
were
thousands
of
--
of
items
at
the
case,
government
demanded
the
jury
in
every
one
of
those,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
most
of
the
--
most
of
those
big
ones
are
the
west
that
did
that,
have
thousands
of
pieces
of
land,
parts
of
the
land,
the
government
always
demanded
the
jury,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
the
court
was
so
clogged
that
for
years
and
years,
they
couldn't
get
their
money
after
the
--
after
the
government
had
taken
it
from
them,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
happened
--
it
happened
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
habitually,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
in
the
big
one
like
the
hanford
case
where
you
have
thousands
of
--
of
items
or
thousands
of
partials
rather?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
the
government
hold
up
those
cases
for
years
and
years
and
clog
the
whole
--
the
court
system
up
in
that
part
of
the
country
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
demand
juries
who
wouldn't
try
them
before
the
court
and
wouldn't
try
them
before
a
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
government
has
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
has
challenged
the
whole
system
hasn't
it,
that
repeatedly
have
tried
--
didn't
the
government
--
didn't
the
department
of
justice
try
to
--
to
cut
off
the
appropriation
for
commissioners
for
a
period
of
five
or
six
years
before
the
last
year
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
--
by
the
department
of
justice,
didn't
the
department
of
justice
go
before
the
appropriation
committee
and
ask
him
to
cutoff
the
appropriation
for
commissioners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
it
been
done
--
would've
been
on
the
--
in
the
state
of
--
of
georgia
in
--
in
the
courts,
we
would
not
have
been
able
to
have
any
commissioners
at
any
place
no
matter
--
no
matter
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
necessary
they
might
be
in
the
--
in
the
multiple
condemnation
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)

warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
object
to
these
findings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
where
was
the
first
--
when
was
the
first
opportunity
you
had
to
object
to
the
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
--
were
filed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
in
--
in
those
objections
specified
what
--
what
you
thought
the
--
they
should
contain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
did
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
you
specify
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
respects
if
they
were
wrong
in
--
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
you
--
did
you
comment
on
--
on
wherein
they
lacked
specificity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wasn't
that
done?
you
wanted
to
correct
your
thing
down
there
where
it
should've
been
corrected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
you
make
it
there
as
well
as
you
can
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
could've
required
the
commissioners
to
make
the
findings
if
you
had
pointed
out
the
efficiency
of
those
findings,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
my
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
if
--
if
that
could've
been
done
there,
why
shouldn't
it
been
down
there
instead
of
you
now
pointing
out
the
deficiency
to
us
but
having
failed
to
do
it
with
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
it
sufficiently
done?
