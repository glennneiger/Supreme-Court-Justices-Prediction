mr.
harold
s.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
joined
in
a
request
that
certiorari
be
granted
in
this
case
and
we
did
so
because
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
in
a
valid
conflict
with
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
merz
case.
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
eminently
correct
and
that
it
is
the
merz
decision
that's
erroneous.
these
cases
reflect
that
the
lower
courts
have
founded
the
bet
in
regard
to
the
use
of
federal
rule
71a
(h)
commissioners.
this
is
not
surprising
because
jury
trial
is
the
rule,
albeit,
too
often
ignored
and
the
use
of
the
commission
is
an
exception.
now,
at
the
time
the
rule
was
enacted,
some
46
out
of
the
present
50
states
provided
for
a
jury
trial
either
de
novo
from
the
viewers
or
the
land
commissioners'
report
or
at
some
stage
on
appeal.
but
the
rule
changed
that
and
got
away
from
the
--
that
double
procedure
that
it
had
been
in
effect
even
the
--
the
previous
federal
experience
with
the
tva
where
the
commission
would
render
award
then
either
party
could
have
a
trial
de
novo
by
three
judges
or
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
could
treat
it
de
novo.
but
the
federal
rule
got
away
from
that
and
made
the
commission,
the
judicial
tribunal.
now,
the
fact
that
a
number
of
the
district
courts
have
allowed
the
exception
to
devour
the
rule,
we
think
really
just
points
out
the
need
for
careful
and
full
report
by
the
commission,
to
show
what
it
has
done.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
in
--
in
many
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
districts,
sir,
it's
just
automatic.
they
use
them
entirely
on
some
districts.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
we
have
gotten
away
from
the
routine
demand
of
jury
trial,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
now,
the
government
is
vigorously
pressing
a
program
that's
called
"our
small
track
program"
where
we're
urging
the
courts
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury
or
without
a
commissioner,
the
judge
itself
to
hear
these
cases.
and
in
those
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
oh,
very
much.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
last
few
years,
we
have
cut
the
pending
truckload
down
from
36,000
to
now,
i'm
happy
to
say,
in
the
19,000
pending
cases
and
largely
because
we
have
persuaded
courts
to
hear
these,
particularly
the
small
value
cases.
the
administrative
officer
of
the
united
states
courts
in
its
annual
report
took
a
case
into
command
the
lands
division
for
this
program
and
to
speak
of
the
success
of
it.
but
this
was
big
business,
your
honors.
here,
in
this
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
actually
--
yes,
it
has
since
--
since
this
case,
sorry.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
before
that,
we
would
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
we
would
have
a
routine
demand
for
a
jury
trial
and
as
mr.
marquis
indicated
yesterday,
then
as
the
cases
came
up.
depending
on
the
nature
of
them,
we
frequently
proceed
to
some
other
way
of
trying
out.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
in
many
of
the
early
projects
we
did.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
it
did
before.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
that
happened,
your
honor.
and
it's
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
and
there
--
there
were
number
of
cases
where
we
did
feel
that
a
commission
was
proper.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
you
had
a
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
that
would
be
one
of
the
instances,
i
think,
where
a
commission
--
you
can
consider
using
a
--
a
commission
where
you
have
many
trucks
particularly
if
they
are
small
value
and
out
considerable
distance
where
a
court
sits,
we
concede
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
that
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
that
did
happen.
i'm
happy
to
say
we
have
a
--
a
program
now
that
is
much
more
enlightening
than
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
that
we're
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
we're
going
tremendously
on
it.
i
just
--
it
might
be
interesting
to
the
court
in
this
past
year.
in
the
fiscal
year,
there
were
over
8000
new
condemnation
tracks
that
brought
in
the
condemnation
in
1914
new
cases.
total
cost
last
year,
we
spend
over
$81
million
in
condemnation.
so
this
is
tremendously
big
business.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
sir.
no,
in
this
case
we're
not.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
there
was
opposition
to
it,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
as
what
went
on
but
i
concede
that
there
was
some
debates
and
there
was
a
question,
in
fact,
at
one
time,
they
did
cut
off
an
appropriation
for
commissioners.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
yes,
sir.
in
general,
there
are
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes.
and
there's
no
require
--
there
was
no
requirements
filled
out
as
to
what
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
their
qualifications
need
there
be
--
need
be.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
generally,
yes,
sir.
normally,
though
not
necessarily,
there
is
a
lawyer
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
a
lawyer,
there
was
a
businessman,
there
was
a
real
estate
man.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
there
can
be,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
commission
itself
determines
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
and
frequently,
for
example
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
you
can
make
your
objection
to
it
in
some
--
the
circuit
has
been
indicated
that
the
commission
should
receive
anything
whether
normally
admissible
or
not.
generally,
the
chairman
of
the
commission
was
a
lawyer
and
will
rule
on
it.
but
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
sometimes
yes
and
sometimes
no.
in
this
particular
case
for
example,
we
found
when
we're
going
to
send
up
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
that
the
reporter
apparently
had
not
even
made
the
copy
that
normally
goes
to
the
court
and
one
volume
of
the
transcript.
we
sent
the
original
on
down
to
the
court
so
they'd
have
at
that.
and
the
court,
in
this
instance,
does
not
recite
that
it
looked
up
at
the
transcript
after
all.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
where
they
are
inadequate
for
reviewing,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
where
--
where
they
don't
--
where
they
don't
show
the
grounds
for
decision
using
the
language
of
this
court,
i'd
like
to
get
into
it
at
a
moment,
or
as
mr.
--
as
judge
jerome
frank
said
in
the
westchester
county
case
that
mr.
marquis
has
referred
to
yesterday
said
the
rational
foundation
and
that
is
where
we
are
lacking
in
this
particular
case
here.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
the
rational
foundation,
the
reasons
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
the
basis
and
reasons
for
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--the
award.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
we're
not
given
the
grounds
of
decision.
and
i'd
like
to
go
into
and
show
you
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes.
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
normally
not.
no.
no
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
think
it's
one
of
the
difficulties
when
they
start
talking
in
terms
of
rule
52
(a).
that
isn't
applicable
here
as
i
see
it
except
by
analogy
where
expressly
--
rule
71a
(h)
expressly
adopts
rule
53
(e)
(2)
in
this
respect
but
some
of
the
courts,
i
think,
have
just
taken
upon
themselves
to
change
the
award
where
they
shouldn't
do.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
either.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
either.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir,
i
am.
under
--
they
can
modify,
of
course,
under
rule
53
(e)
(2)
which
is
the
proper
rule.
and
one
of
the
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
sir?
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
the
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir,
it
is.
the
basic
thing
is
the
--
is
the
amount
and
that
is
the
thing
that
--
i
say
there
has
to
be
a
rational
foundation
for.
we
have
--
we
have
to
know
the
--
the
reasons.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
we
think
it
should
not
that
the
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
should
other
proper
construction
of
53
(e)
(2).
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
oh,
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
it
may
modify.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir,
it
may.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
the
--
if
credibility
of
witness
is
involved,
then
no.
and
that
--
to
that,
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
only
recent
opinion
on
condemnation
case
that
has
come
down
since
the
briefs
and
that's
the
rainwater
case
in
the
eighth
circuit.
when
you
get
into
credibility
of
witnesses,
then
we
feel
that
it
is
not
proper
for
the
district
judge
to
just
modify
in
that
manner.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
i
think
he
may
not
it
if
credibility
of
witness
is
involved.
may
i
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir,
he
can.
he
can.
may
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
it
did.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
several
volumes,
your
honor,
yes.
sack
of
transcripts
so
high,
the
district
judge
does
not
say
that
he
read
that,
states
that
he
did
it
on
--
on
the
report.
now,
may
i
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i'm
arguing
that
there
--
there
must
be
sufficient
to
show
the
hows
and
whys.
may
i
use
an
analogy
that
was
used
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
similar
question
was
asked
with
my
colleague
sitting
here?
said
that
for
all
the
world,
the
report
here,
reminded
him
of
a
murder
mystery
that
was
50
pages
long,
with
pages
45
to
49
missing.
the
first
44
pages
had
given
the
cast
of
characters
in
the
situation
and
all
the
suspects.
and
then
you
had
a
gap
and
you
came
to
the
last
page
that
shows
the
murderer
but
the
--
the
why
and
the
how
and
the
reasons
were
all
missing.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
he
allowed
us
how
the
government
had
been
murdered
and
we
wanted
to
know
how.
carrying
that
analogy
a
step
further,
the
court
of
appeals
has
sent
it
back
for
those
missing
pages
to
show
us
how
and
why.
may
i
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
answered
that
well
by
putting
it
this
way,
they
said,
"we
do
not
say
that
every
contested
issue
raised
on
the
record
before
the
commission
must
be
resolved
by
a
separate
finding
of
fact.
we
do
say,
however,
that
there
must
be
sufficient
findings
of
subsidiary
facts
so
that
will
appear
--
so
that
it
will
appear
to
the
reviewing
court
that
the
ultimate
findings
of
value
were
soundly
and
legally
based.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
now,
certainly
that's
--
that's
good
law.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
in
--
in
the
dalehite
opinion,
mr.
justice
black,
this
court
spoke
of
the
preliminary
and
basic
facts.
in
the
florida
v.
united
states,
this
court
spoke
of
basic
or
essential
findings.
in
the
cunningham
case
that
--
that
was
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
court
spoke
of
basic
and
evidentiary
facts.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
this
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
let
me
explain
some
of
the
things
that
are
missing
here
but
i
think
it'll
--
it'll
help
--
help
show
what
we
feel
the
parties
were
entitled
to.
for
example,
normally,
indeed
almost
unbearably,
an
award
in
condemnation
will
be
somewhere
before
the
--
between
the
condemnor's
high
testimony
and
the
condemnee's
low
testimony.
but
not
so
here,
the
award
here
was
in
excess
of
the
landowners'
own
witnesses,
own
expert
witness
rather,
from
the
size
of
the
award,
we're
not
told
why
this
is
the
case
but
from
the
size
of
the
award,
it
would
appear
that
these
commissioners,
for
some
reason,
decided
to
base
their
award
on
the
testimony
of
the
landowner,
himself
and
the
lay
witnesses.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
certainly
--
no,
it's
not
impermissible,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
think
in
this
connection,
id
like
to
quote
a
sentence
used
by
judge
louis
goodman
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
he
characterized
that
type
of
testimony
in
this
way,
"so
--
on
the
other
hand,
the
testimony
of
the
defendants
and
their
respective
appraisal
witnesses,
appear
to
me
to
be
things
with
the
over
enthusiasm
of
owners
and
to
represent
more
of
the
viewpoint
of
one
who
attaches
value
because
of
sentimentality
and
devotion
to
his
or
her
own
property."
now
--
now,
that
was
all
that
was
left
here.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
he
--
yes,
he
affirmed
the
award
but
that's
all.
now
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
they
are
all
--
we
feel
low
that
when
such
a
highly
unusual
result
of
this
is
reached,
certainly,
there
should
be
some
reason.
we
should
know
why.
all
the
experts
were
rejected
and
only
this
type
of
lay
witness
was
accepted.
we
feel
there's
--
there's
many
other
things.
for
example,
the
comparable
sales
data
here,
government
witnesses
relied
heavily
on
comparable
sales
and
recited
many
of
them
and
yet
the
report
doesn't
show
at
all
how
these
were
construed.
the
basic
conflict
was
over
the
--
the
value
to
be
given
these
comparable
sales.
the
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
at
least
that
would
have
given
us
the
reason
we'd
have
known
what
it
did
in
that
respect.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i'm
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
i'm
--
i'm
saying,
we
don't
know
what
they
did.
there's
--
there
are
many
things
for
example
that
might've
been
clear
error
if
we
knew.
for
example,
in
the
matter
of
improvements
to
the
land,
the
government
witnesses
testified
as
to
the
value
of
land
as
enhanced
by
the
improvements
on
it,
which
is
the
proper
way.
and
yet
some
of
the
landowners'
witnesses
valued
the
land
so
much
per
acre
and
then
added
so
many
thousand
dollars
for
this,
of
improvement
and
that
improvement.
now,
if
the
commissioners,
in
arriving
at
this
high
awards,
just
took
a
land
value
and
then
arbitrarily
added
so
much
for
improvements,
that
was
an
erroneous
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
we
don't
know
what
they
did.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
don
think
so,
no,
sir.
there
were
other
aspects
of
conflicting
evidence
that
showed
from
the
report
but
no
way
of
knowing
how
it
resolved.
for
example,
there
was
testimony
about
the
fencing,
now
fencing
is
mentioned
in
the
report
but
there
is
no
finding
as
to
the
fact
that
fencing
was
necessary,
there's
no
finding
as
to
how
much
fencing,
there's
no
finding
as
to
the
type
of
fencing,
all
of
these
would
make
a
difference.
access
road
is
a
similar
thing.
there's
testimony
as
to
access
roads,
the
report
show
it
but
there's
no
showing
how
that
fits
into
the
award.
we
simply
don't
know.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
oh,
yes,
sir.
objection
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
after
the
commission
report
was
received,
your
honor,
and
then
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
--
objections
were
filed.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
oh,
yes.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
with
--
with
the
trial
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
the
objections
appear,
first
set
for
example
on
page
50
to
51
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
50
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
each
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
not
--
not
in
broad
detail
or
not
in
detail,
your
honor.
each
set
did
include
some
particular
evidence
that
we
said
that
were
alone
--
was
erroneously
admitted.
but
the
--
the
objections
were
mainly
on
the
part
--
on
the
point
that
they
weren't
sufficiently
specific
to
know
what
was
done.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
sir
and
that
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
your
honor,
we
think
this
court
answered
that
in
the
kelley
case
by
indicating
that
--
well,
let
me
say
--
say
first
that
a
party
cannot
deal
with
specificity
it
--
to
a
report
that
is
never
seen.
we
think
this
is
where
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
circuit
difference
and
that
the
fifth
is
correct.
in
the
lewis
case,
which
incidentally
rejected
the
overruled
judge
hall's
--
a
case
where
judge
hall
said
that
the
report
only
had
to
be
like
a
jury
verdict.
that
was
overruled
but
the
ninth
circuit
indicated
that
the
--
there
had
to
be
detailed
statements.
i
suppose
in
the
negative
to
show
exactly
what
you
felt
was
wrong.
this
circuit,
in
remanding
the
case,
does
not
place
any
limitation
to
that
nature.
and
we
think
clearly
that
the
parties
cannot
be
expected
to
give
detailed
objections
to
an
incomplete
report,
one,
that
they
don't
know
what
the
inferences
were,
what
the
--
what
the
reasoning
was,
what
the
commission
had
in
mind.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
unless
you
know,
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
it's
where
a
report
is
insufficient,
then
it
goes
back
to
be
completed
and
there
is
--
was
coming
to
the
--
well,
one
of
their
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
think
this
goes
to
a
jurisdictional
matter.
the
circuit
court
was
not
persuaded
by
this
argument
below.
i'm
not
sure
that
anything
under
this
is
specifically
here.
but
even
so,
we
don't
feel
that
the
parties
should
be
put
in
the
position
of
having
to
try
to
be
specific
with
report
--
with
respect
to
a
report
that
does
not
contain
these
hows
and
whys
and
wherefores.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
think,
i
would
do
as
i
do
here
and
explain
the
--
the
things
that
we
feel
are
necessary
that
we
--
we
should've
be
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
it's
--
it's
incomplete,
your
honor,
where
you're
not
given
any
of
these
grounds
of
decision
using
the
words
of
this
case.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
without
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
well,
yes,
you
--
you
can
go
that
far
but
as
far
as
specifics,
this
court
isn't
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
no,
sir,
we
didn't.
we
feel
that
it's
sufficient
here
go
to
object
to
a
report
that
is
--
isn't
sufficient
and
object
to
it
on
that
ground
and
have
it
go
back
to
get
complete.
this
court
in
kelley,
for
example,
said
in
kelley
v.
everglades
district,
it
is
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
search
the
record
and
analyze
the
evidence
in
order
to
supply
findings
which
the
trial
court
failed
to
make.
in
the
florida
case,
there's
also
some
excellent
language
by
this
court
and
in
several
other
cases.
we
think
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
we
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
we
did
do
it,
of
course,
to
some
extent
as
i
say.
each
one
of
the
objections
that
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
i
don't
think
it's
necessary,
your
honor.
the
government's
position
is
that
where
there
is
an
inadequate
report,
it
should
be
sufficient
to
say
it
is
inadequate
and
get
an
adequate
report
before
the
parties
are
in
the
position
of
trying
to
have
to
spell
out
all
the
negatives
of
what
should
or
should
not
have
been
there.
we
think,
the
proper
way,
the
--
the
burden
is
on
the
fact
finding
body
to
file
a
sufficient
report.
may
i
--
may
i
say
this
that
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir,
and
that
--
that's
the
position.
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
all
--
mr.
harold
s.
harrison
yes,
sir.
and
all
the
government
seeking
is
meaningful
participation
by
the
court
in
these
cases.
we
get
it
where
there's
a
jury
and
we
get
in
the
judge-tried
case.
but
unless
you
require
adequate
findings,
you
don't
get
it
in
the
commissioners.
thank
you.
