mr.
roger
p.
marquis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
and
the
case
to
follow
it
are
the
first
to
present
to
this
court
problems
concerning
the
procedural
administration
of
rule
71a
which
was
adopted
in
9
--
it
became
effective
in
1951,
providing
the
federal
condemnation
procedure
and
practice.
the
precise
issue
here
of
both
of
these
cases
is
the
nature
of
the
findings
and
the
report
that
is
required
to
be
made
by
such
a
commission.
it
is
pointed
under
that
rule.
there's
been
a
considerable
diversion
of
opinion
in
the
lower
courts
and
by
attorneys
on
this
subject
and
on
other
subjects
concerning
the
relationship
of
a
commission
under
the
federal
rule
and
the
district
court
and
their
relative
functions.
a
little
bit
later,
i
will
detail
a
little
of
the
history
of
this
rule
and
its
comparison
which
i
think
shows
that
this
is
a
com
--
this
commission
is
a
completely
new
creature
of
condemnation
law
and
is
not
to
be
analogized
or
compared
in
its
legal
terms
with
the
commissioners,
the
board
of
appraisers
or
the
board
of
views
or
whatever
they
might
be
called,
with
which
we
fam
--
were
familiar
before
1951
and
which
prevails
under
state
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
the
--
there
was
a
great
conflict
and
difficulties
about
the
condemnation
rule.
so
that
it
was
postponed.
the
committee
postponed
it
for
almost
20
years
be
--
and
there
was
a
great
controversy
on
this
particular
subject.
it
went
back
and
forth
with
the
committee
a
couple
of
times
before
this
rule
were
ever
adopted,
especially
this
rule
71a
(h)
which
is
the
rule
as
to
method
of
trial.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
was
not
--
we
were
conforming
to
local
law.
we
were
following
the
local
practice
up
to
1951.
the
--
first,
our
position
is
this,
that
the
commission's
report
must
state
what
the
facts,
physical
and
economic
and
that
includes
what
the
evaluation
opinions
are,
what
was
the
basis
for
them,
what
are
the
other
facts
relating
to
evaluation,
the
issues
before
them,
it
must
state
what
the
controversial
issues
are
between
the
parties
and
it
must
state
how
the
commission
resolved
those
controversies,
and
what
was
the
basis
for
its
particular
awards
that
it
made.
that
is
our
basic
position
in
both
of
these
cases.
the
merz
case,
the
one
which
i
am
arguing,
can
be
justified.
the
judgment
below
can
be
affirmed
only
if
you
conclude
that
none
of
the
things
which
i
mentioned
are
necessary
to
be
reported
by
a
commission
and
only
if
you
conclude,
as
the
tenth
circuit
did
in
its
opinion,
that
a
so-called
general
finding,
that
is
simply
a
monetary
award,
is
all
the
commission
need
to
tell
us.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it's
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
necessarily
a
particular
case.
it
maybe
a
particular
project
sometimes
or
in
kansas,
at
the
moment,
we
have
a
group
of
12
standing
commissions.
but
they
are
ad
hoc
in
the
sense
they're
non-professional.
they're
engaged
in
other
activities
and
this
is
a
secondary
activity
of
theirs.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
of
course,
are
no
provisions
in
the
rule
as
to
who
shall
be
a
commission.
the
--
it
varies
considerably
between
the
judges
and
the
district
courts
in
various
places
of
what
they
appoint,
i
would
say,
almost
invariably.
they
will
appoint
at
least
one
lawyer.
and,
they
may
have
--
in
this
case,
we
have
two
lawyers
and
appraiser.
very
often,
you
have
an
appraiser
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
a
real
estate
appraiser
yes.
or
very
often
you
may
have
one
real
estate
man,
real
estate
broker,
a
businessman,
and
a
lawyer.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
are
three.
it
provides
for
three.
the
rule
provides
for
three.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh,
yes.
that's
--
that's
what
our
case
is
because
we
say
we
don't
know
how
you
reach
your
figure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no.
no,
no
this
--
this
commission
is
not
to
go
outside
the
evidence.
in
our
view,
this
is
a
judicial
commission.
this
is
a
judicial
fact-finder.
they
are
not
to
use
their
personal
knowledge
and
go
outside
the
evidence
and
reach
their
result
on
some
basis
whether
this
is
their
own
opinion
as
a
real
estate
appraiser
or
whether
it's
knowledge
they
get
from
other
places.
this
is
the
only
judicial
trial
as
to
compensation.
and
in
our
view,
it
has
to
be
on
the
same
basis
and
i
think
this
is
one
thing,
i
think
that
all
of
the
lower
courts
have
agreed
upon
that
this
is
tested
by
the
ordinary
standards
of
judicial
adjudication.
it
isn't
simply
a
personal
appraisal
and
that's
--
as
i
adverted
to
a
moment
ago,
that's
the
difference
with
--
between
state
law.
but
that
is
the
kind
of
a
commission
that
almost
all
of
these
state
laws
where
there
is
the
dual
first
board
of
commission
or
board
of
appraiser
or
board
of
view
and
then
a
right
to
an
entirely
new
judicial
adjudication
on
a
jury
trial
de
novo.
now
there,
the
informal
non-judicial
type
of
adjudication
was
perfectly
proper
because
it
was
simply
tentative
estimates,
similar
to
our
federal
declaration
of
taking
procedure.
but
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no
--
no,
no
there's
plenty
of
room.
there's
no
--
a
commission
is
not
bound
by
any
of
the
testimony
of
any
particular
expert.
they
can
use
their
matter
of
judgment
within
the
range
of
the
evidence
in
their
record,
and
that's
the
function
which
our
view
has.
but
as
jerome
frank
put
it
in
one
case
where
they
were
saying
that
evaluation
is
just
a
guess,
but
he
says
the
guess
must
have
the
rational
foundation.
it
can't
just
be
a
figure
out
of
the
air
or
it
can't,
as
in
this
case
of
ours
where
we
have
a
formula
used
by
one
of
the
witnesses
mr.
wilcox,
it
can't
be
a
formula
that
is
irrational.
now
here,
we
had
the
landowners
who
--
these
clearance
easements
are
imposed
at
varying
heights
over
various
tracts
of
land.
one
of
them
is
from
105
feet
up
to
165
feet.
it's
quite
high
in
the
air
over
this
farm.
there's
no
interference
with
farming.
yet,
the
landowners
all
in
each
instance
came
in
and
said
--
each
said,
“my
land
is
depreciated
in
value
of
50%
by
impositions
of
those
easements.”
now,
i
think,
if
the
commission
had
said,
“we
agree
with
the
landowners
that
each
of
them
is
depreciated
50%
even
though
it's
100
feet
above
mr.
smith's
property
and
it's
only
13
feet
above
mr.
merz's
property.”
i
think
that
would
be
an
irrational
decision
which
would
appear
from
the
report
when
the
commission
tells
us
what
basis
they
used
to
arrive
at
their
result.
and
that
is
the
obligation
we
say
for
example,
within
reason
and
of
course
i'm
not
saying
they
have
to
go
into
all
of
minutia
of
course
not.
but,
within
reason
we
had
comparable
sales
here
that
were
relied
upon
by
both
parties.
we
had
some.
they
had
a
few.
we
had
much
more
as
we
usually
do,
one
of
them
was
a
sale
of
property
right
next
door
to
the
merz's
property.
we
think
there
should
be
some
indication
whether
the
commission
gave
weight
to
comparable
sales
and
if
so,
just
what
sales
they
did
and
didn't
consider.
so
that
then,
that
evidence
can
be
weighed.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
their
fees
are
set
by
the
courts
and
there
is
a
separate
appropriation
now.
that
was
one
matter
that's
given
us
some
difficulty
in
the
last
two
or
three
congresses
on
the
matter
of
the
appropriation.
there
is
a
separate
fund
that's
appropriated
which
--
in
the
department
of
justice
appropriation
and
they're
paid
from
that
fund.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
an
--
individual
basis
and
they
vary
greatly
throughout
the
country.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
very
often,
they
may
be.
a
great
many
of
them
are
set
on
a
per
diem
at
the
time
of
appointment.
others
are
set
after
the
report
has
been
made.
on
the
basis
of
what
their
services
were,
there
was
one
case
in
the
second
circuit
where,
amongst
other
things
there
was
a
question
on
appeal
as
to
the
amount
of
their
fees
for
the
commissioners'
appeal
because
they
weren't
allowed
to
know
and
the
second
circuit
raised
this.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
there
is
a
range
from
--
for
example
from
--
i
know
i've
seen
a
sum
of
$30
a
day
and,
a
great
many
of
them,
up
to
$100
a
day.
so
that
there
is
a
300%
range.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right,
there's
a
--
it
--
of
course
it
depends
on
region
but
it
also
depends
on
personal
approach
and
so
many
other
factors.
turning
just
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
sure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
district
judges
do
this.
here
again,
we
get
into
practice.
some
of
them
give
instructions,
general
instructions,
at
the
time
they
appoint
the
commission
or
sometime
later
on
general
principles
of
condemnation
law.
others
of
them,
for
example
in
this
record,
there's
no
instructions
at
all
given.
the
difficulty
there
is
of
course,
that
they
are
not
cued
to
the
precise
issues
or
the
precise
evidence
in
the
cases.
they're
simply
generalizations
and
for
example,
we've
had
in
one
of
the
cases
we
cite,
the
muller
case
where
the
commission
itself
recited
these
general
principles
and
said,
"we
filed
them
in
our
report
but
when
after
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
we
got
a
specific
report
as
to
what
we
did,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us
the
second
time
that
they
simply
had
misapplied
the
principles.”
so
that
we
don't
have
--
as
example
in
a
jury
case,
we
don't
have
the
instructions
given
tied
to
and
relating
to
the
special
evidence
in
the
case
because
the
judge
hasn't
been
there
during
the
trial.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
no,
that's
just
like
the
jury
i
think
that
--
and
certainly
that
is
the
concept
of
--
in
jury
cases
and
--
many
times
the
judges
in
judge-tried
cases
too,
we
--
of
which
we
have
quite
a
few.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
difference
of
course
with
the
jury
is
that
you
have
rulings
--
you
have
your
rulings
on
inadmissibility
of
evidence,
which
is
one
of
our
prime
means
of
confining
the
evidence
to
just
what
is
involved.
you
have
your
instructions.
you
have
the
judge's
presence
so
that
his
abil
--
his
authority
to
grant
a
new
trial
to
escape
just
irrational
or
i'll
result
to
that
sort.
and,
you
have
the
fact
which
i
think
is
important
here
too.
the
fact
that
a
jury
trial
commences,
they
remain
together,
and
you
come
in
with
a
verdict
so
that
extraneous
influences
are
at
a
minimum.
these
commissioners
uniformly
even
when
as
here
they
had
a
five-day
hearing,
they
go
off
about
their
business
and
two
months
later
as
in
this
case,
render
their
original
report
and
then,
a
year
later,
that
they
supplemented
it.
so
that,
without
making
any
invidious
charges
that
their
human
nature
in
the
business,
they're
subjected
to
many
influences
and
the
evidence
be
--
tends
to
become
something
that
happened
in
the
past
by
the
time
they
come
to
making
a
report.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh,
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
there
are
this
record
--
this
record
has
the
full
transcript
of
the
testimony
just
as
with
a
jury
trial.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
sometimes,
sometimes
not.
we
have
just
--
we've
--
here
he
did,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
he
simply
said
here
“i've
decided
to
confirm
the
report.”
his
letter
said
no
more
than
that
and
we
have
--
quite
basically,
our
complaint
is
that
even
here
before
this
court,
through
all
the
commission
and
the
courts,
we
have
never
been
affirmably
told
how
did
the
commission
reach
these
figures,
some
of
which
are
down
to
the
odd
dollar.
there's
one
that
is
$33,
another
one
is
507
--
$7,510,
something
like
that.
and
our
point
is
that
we
can't
judicially
review
such
a
thing,
unless
we
know,
unless
we're
told
how
they
arrived
at
that
amount.
they
were
said
--
the
only
one
thing
that
is
said
is
that
they
followed
a
before
and
after
process,
which
is
what
you
do.
you
--
we
value
the
land
before
imposition
of
the
easement,
there
was
great
controversy
on
that
and
the
value
of
the
land
after
imposition
of
the
easement.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
in
an
easement
case.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
that's
the
way
you
must
value
and
that
the
only
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i've
never
seen
a
record
that
had
come
up
with
any
other
thing
except
this
formula
which
this
witness
had.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
other
way
you
value
an
easement
except
to
determine
the
damage
to
the
land
because
of
the
imposition
of
the
easement
by
determining
the
value
before
and
after,
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
hadn't
--
the
terms
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
hadn't
--
i
hadn't
--
specifically
analogized.
i
hadn't
intended
to
analogize
it
to
an
administrative
agency
anymore
than
i
would
analogize
it
to
a
district
judge.
it's
a
fact-finder.
it's
a
judicial
adjudication
of
this
particular
fact.
but
i
do
think
what
we
do
say
is,
because
of
the
differences
in
the
way
that
they
proceed,
the
requirements
they're
applicable
to
district
judges
and
to
all
other
fact-finders
administrative
agencies,
district
judges,
court
of
claims,
and
all
other
fact-finders
other
than
a
jury
for
purposes
of
judicial
review
are
necessary
because
in
the
jury
case,
we
have
our
other
means
which
have
--
may
have
developed
over
our
centuries
of
law
as
to
assuring
of
correct
principles
being
applied.
in
that
connection,
this
matter
of
the
formula
is
very
important.
i
think
it
is
very
illustrative.
you
would
never
in
the
world
get
a
jury
trial
where
the
court
of
appeals
could
say,
“we
conclude
simply
from
the
trial
that
the
jury
ignored
50%
of
the
landowners'
testimony.”
that's
what
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
about
the
wilcox's
formula.
they
said
they
admit
the
--
it's
probably
a
no
good
valuation
but
they
simply
say,
“we
don't
think
the
commission
gave
it
credit.”
the
rule
in
jury
trials
would
be
very
clear
that
this
would
be
reversible
in
a
jury
trial
because
the
rule
is
that
an
error
as
to
admission
of
evidence,
which
goes
to
a
substantiality,
has
to
be
something
substantial,
yes.
but,
an
error
and
particularly
in
condemnation,
case
after
case
we
have
where
the
reversal
in
a
jury
trial
is
because
an
element
of
value
was
allowed
to
be
brought
in
which
shouldn't
have
been
a
claim
of
value
--
a
contention
of
value
which
should've
been
excluded.
and,
presumptively,
we
--
no
one
knows
unless
we
ask
the
jury
whether
it
affected
their
result
or
not.
therefore,
presumptively
it
did
affect
the
verdict
and
it
must
be
reversed.
now,
that's
the
difference
in
the
jury
trial.
we
don't
have
that,
and
that's
why
we
think
to
supply
the
judicial
review
that
would
exist
in
the
other
direction
in
the
jury
trial.
then
we
turn
to
the
requirements
that
have
been
developed
as
to
all
other
fact-finders
and
that
is
the
finding
of
what
facts
and
how
we
got
to
our
result,
not
just
our
ultimate
result.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right
sir.
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
actually
here,
the
record
shows
that
they
had
originally,
in
their
answers
asked
for
a
jury
trial
and
then
later
they
made
the
motion
for
appointment
of
a
commission
that's
right
and
it's
not
infrequent
practice
in
various
places,
although
the
rule
doesn't
specifically
provide
for
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
i
don't
think
so.
there
is
a
docket
entry
that
shows
earlier
at
pretrial
the
judge
had
decided
to
have
a
commission.
now,
just
what
the
landowner's
position
was
at
that
hearing
i
don't
know.
that
isn't
in
this
printed
record
here.
it's
in
the
docket
entries.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
that's
right,
it
was
--
it
was
a
rare
objection
and
the
record
contains
the
landowner's
motion.
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
at
all,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
we
don't
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
and
this
has
lead
to
a
lot
of
misunderstanding.
under
the
rule,
it
says
that
the
objection
must
be
made
within
20
days
of
time
to
answer.
and,
we
had
always
construed
that
when
the
rule
went
into
effect
as
for
purposes
of
the
record
acquire
--
requiring
us
to
object
to
the
point
of
the
commission
on
the
bottom
of
our
complaints,
and
that's
what
we
have
been
doing.
not
that
we
insisted
upon
it
later
on
when
the
--
it
became
clear
to
us
what
the
case
was
and
what
it
was
about
and
what
the
situation
was,
we
have
not
insisted
on
juries
in
every
case
by
any
means.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
devised
--
which
we
think
is
a
substitute
for
this
problem
of
the
commissions
which
many
think
expedite
and
which
we
think
delay
things,
we
have
a
program
whereby
we
submit
to
the
court
without
a
jury
these
smaller
cases
and
we
get
rid
of
them
on
the
calendars
and
we've
reduced
our
standing
workload
one-third
by
doing
it.
so
that
we
do
not
ask
in
every
case
by
any
means
insist
on
commission
--
on
jury
or
dully
object
to
many
instances
to
use
of
commissions.
we
do
think
that,
to
make
it
effective
and
to
make
a
true
judicial
evaluation,
that
we
should
be
told
how
they
reach
their
result.
that's
the
basic
case
that
we
have
here.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it's
--
there
are
various
--
it's
very
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it's
not
too
remote
from
the
opinion
which
starts
out
and
tells
you
what's
involved
in
the
case
and
then
tells
you
what
happens.
as
--
i
don't
think
it
should
be
too
difficult
and
it's
to
the
extent
that
is.
it's
a
discipline
in
putting
down
on
the
paper
what
your
vague
notions
may
be.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
think
that
that's
in
effect
which
you'd
require
of
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
i
think
quite
clearly
in
evaluation
case,
certainly
in
the
court
of
claims
cases.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
for
example
or
in
other
evaluations.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
if
they
give
us
satisfactory
findings
and
conclusion
which
show
what
they
relied
on
to
reach
their
result
and
gives
us
some
assurance
that
they
weren't
going
outside
of
the
record
or
they
weren't
relying
on
matters
that
we
thought
was
objectionable
or
irrational,
that's
what
we
want.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
the
second
case
we
have
tomorrow.
they
did
write,
of
what
we
think
is
perfectly
acceptable,
a
statement
of
what
the
case
is
all
about.
they
did
not
however,
set
it
--
settled
the
controversies
between
the
parties.
and
that
is
the
ground
on
which
we
object
to
that
report
that
they've
got
to
do
the
two
things.
they've
got
to
tell
us
what
the
case
is
about
and
they've
got
to
tell
us
what
the
--
how
they
resolved
what
the
parties
were
controverting
about.
in
a
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
have
to
simply
choose
between
the
--
between
the
two
sides
in
their
expert
opinion.
no,
they
weigh
the
expert's
opinion.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
they
can
very
reasonably
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well
your
honor,
you're
putting
the
case
which
we
have
been
trying
for
20
years
to
eliminate
in
this.
that
may
sound
strange
but
it
is
exactly
the
campaign
we've
been
on
that
merely
an
expert
getting
on
the
stand
a
nd
given
a
figure
is
no
evidence
at
all.
and,
the
appraisers
in
the
--
the
respectable
appraisers
recognize
that.
that
the
worth
of
that
appraisal
depends
upon
the
basis
for
instance,
the
comparable
sales
and
that's
one
thing
we
keep
emphasizing.
we
bring
out
the
sales
that
were
in
the
area.
we
have
a
map
and
we
put
them
on
the
--
we
illustrate
with
the
comparable
sales
and
then
we
have
a
basis
of
judging
that
opinion.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
there,
in
most
of
these
cases,
it
well
--
may
well
be
that
the
courts
will
say,
“well,
we
think
the
government
appraisers
were
a
little
bit
low.
they
didn't
give
quite
enough
weight
to
this
sale
a
half-mile
down
the
road,
but
the
landowners'
appraisers,
they
were
too
high.
they
ignored
these
other
four
sales
that
were
a
mile
in
the
direction.”
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
we
--
we
have
all
sorts
of
cases
that
get
in
the
varying
degrees
of
difficulty.
but
in
these
farmland
sales,
for
instance
if
you're
looking
in
front
of
these
cases
we
--
they're
here
before
us
on
in
this
ap
--
on
these
two
cases.
we
will
find
comparable
sales,
one
of
them
is
next
door
to
the
merz's
property,
and
we
have
several
sales
showing
a
pattern.
that's
what
we're
after.
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
no,
no
we
don't
exclude.
we
say
sure,
they're
going
to
compromise
in
many,
many
cases
but
the
compromise
has
got
be
on
a
rational
basis.
it's
like
you
can't
have
a
quotient
verdict.
you
can't
just
add
them
all
together
and
divide
it
by
two.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
there's
the
possibility
but
i
personally,
in
25
years
of
working
on
this
subject
of
security,
great
competence
in
the
triers
of
fact
in
working
out
rational
and,
at
least,
reasonable
results
if
properly
guided.
i
think
i'm
--
personally,
i
think
it's
a
lot
better
than
a
lot
of
people
--
critics
of
it
think
it
is.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
if
they
said
we
simply
follow
this
appraisal
report,
then,
the
question
would
be
the
validity
of
that
report
and
whether
it
was
irrational
to
reject
everything
else.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
they
would
agree
in
these
normal
cases.
you
could
disagree
that
far.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
that
they
would
--
not
4
and
5
to
1,
i
mean
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
unless
there's
some
element
and
it's
very
debatable
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
think
you
would
get
such
a
spread
but
if
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
if
they
did.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
the
first
thing
we
want
in
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well
--
well
they
could've
--
first
of
all,
they
could've
given
us
the
value
per
acre
of
the
merz's
property
before
we
imposed
the
easement.
there
was
a
great
controversy
on
that.
they
could've
given
us
the
value
of
the
property
after
we
imposed
the
easement.
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but,
we
don't
know
how
they
got
that.
at
least
we'd
know
that.
we
don't
know
whether
they
took
250,000
or
200,000
or
300,000
acre
on
the
merz's
property.
there
was
evidence
of
300,000
acres,
but
we
don't
know
whether
they
took
that
or
whether
they
took
200
and
their
bigger
difference
is
in
their
subtraction.
it's
in
the
diminution.
we
--
we
just
can't
tell
on
these
figures.
we
use
--
we
know
they
must
have
used
some
system
because
they
came
out
to
figures
like,
as
i
say,
one
of
them
is
$5,733.
well
they
got
there
some
place
or
they
took
a
figure
out
of
the
air
which
would
be
wrong
and
unreasonable.
so
that's
what
we'd
want
to
know.
another
thing
we
want
there
are
several
things
in
here
which
we've
mentioned
in
the
record.
we
want
to
know
where
they
relied
on
this
witness,
wilcox.
we
had
a
motion
to
strike
it
on
several
grounds,
both
because
of
the
formula
and
because
he
wasn't
qualified
because
he
didn't
look
at
sales
in
the
area
and,
in
fact,
in
one
place
in
the
record,
he
says
“i
made
my
opinion
and
i
went
out
looking
for
sales
to
support
it.”
all
those
things
we
think
we're
entitled
to
note
and
to
know
whether
the
value
was
arrived
at
fairly
and
with
regard
to
the
law
or
not.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
unless
there
are
other
questions
why
we
submit
that
we
should
be
told
by
somebody
where
these
figures
came
from?
