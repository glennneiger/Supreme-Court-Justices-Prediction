white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
don't
say
then
the
wrong
---
you
don't
question
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
right
standard
in
reviewing
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
louisiana
standard
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
for
example,
does
the
louisiana
have
that
thing
called
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
placed
insufficient
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
the
--and
then
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
may
be
evidence
here
that
--
that
the
defendant
ran
over
somebody
and
that
even
that
he
ran
over
this
person
who
was
killed,
what's
the
evidence
--
what's
the
evidence,
any
evidence
that
meant
that
he
was
negligent
in
so
do
--
that
he
was
negligent
in
so
doing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
he
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
he
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
finding
in
there
doesn't
mean
he
was
hit
there
and
that
he
was
walking
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
that's
just
evidence
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
struck
but
what
about
the
negligence
of
the
driver
of
the
truck?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
evidence
that
--
you
have
this
a
--
is
that
his
wheels
were
off
--
were
over
on
the
shoulder?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
in
louisiana,
you
can
show
somebody
run
over
somebody
else
on
a
--
on
a
deserted
road
that
--
that
evidence
of
negligence.
justice

is
this
a
dirt
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
footprint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
what
the
evidence
shows
is
that
the
--
well,
it
seems
to
show
that
somebody
was
hit
and
if
he
was
hit,
he
must
have
gone
up
on
the
hood.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
must
--
then
he
drove
off
to
the
