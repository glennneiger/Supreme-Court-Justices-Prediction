he
decided
to
not

with
his
coworkers
and
he
would
walk
home,
it's
about
four
miles
to
the
east.
there's
only
one
road
on
grand
isle
being
highway

he
was
found
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the

there
were

there
were
no
eyewitnesses
to
this
accident
that
caused
his
death.he
wore
a
--
a
denim
overalls
of
blue.
the
--
when
he
--
when
his
body
was
found,
the
investigative
officers
were
notified
and
they
came
to
the
scene
and
made
some
pictures
of
the
body
there
on
the
shoulder
of
the
road
which
pictures
are
introduced
into
evidence
and
are
before
the
court
here.
the
officers
also
made
an
--
an
investigation
and
determined
that
there
was
a
man
that
had
been
on
the
island
as
they
would
call
it
down
there,
in
a
bar,
a
fisherman's
bar
wharf
and
drinking
scotch
and
water
all
afternoon.
this
man
was
paris
theriot
and
he
owned
an
automobile
agency
and
he
came
down
there
to
sell,
the
owner
of
the
business
there,
an
automobile
which
he
did
consummate
the
sale
that
afternoon,
drinking
scotch
and
whiskey
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon.
and
he
left
the
bar
at
about
7:30
of
that
night,
7
pm.
it
was
foggy
and
rainy,
drizzly
evening.
immediately,
the
officers
--
he
became
the
suspect
and
the
officers
went
to
his
--
where
he
lived,
he
got
a
home
on
grand
isle
as
well
as
in
golden
meadow,
louisiana.
and
they
went
up
to
golden
meadow
and
found
him
and
asked
him
if
he'd
been
on
the
island
and
he
first
denied
that
he
hadn't
--
hadn't
been
there
at
all
but
then
he
later
admitted
that
he
had
been
there.
and
they
asked
him
where
his
car
was
and
he
pointed
out
to
it
across
the
bar
there.
and
the
officers
got
the
car
and
made
some
pictures
of
it
in
an
investigation,
examination
of
the
automobile
and
found
that
the
right
rim
of
the
headlight
was
missing.
that
the
front
fender
was
dented
on
the
front
and
that
there
was
a
dent
on
the
hood
of
the
automobile,
about
near
the
windshield
and
that
in
this
denture
--
indentations
on
the
automobile,
there
was
a
blue
coloring.
and
so
the
officers
took
scrapings
of
this
coloring
which
was
fabric-like
and
matched
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
officials,
the
--
the
denim
overalls
that
this
deceased
was
wearing.
mr.
theriot
was
then
asked
if
he
had
washed
his
car
and
he
denied
that
he
had,
although
he
---
he
said
that
it
always
been
washed
every
morning
but
this
morning,
it
hadn't
been
washed.
yet
the
officers
found
some
powdery
--
powdery
substance,
one
of
them
described,
it
looked
like
old
dutch
cleanser
on
the
automobile
indicating
that
it
had
been
washed.
the
officers
also
found
a
towel
--
stuff
behind
the
seat
cover
behind
the
back
--
the
front
seat
up
between
the
seat
and
the
seat
cover
of
a
brown
substance
which
appeared
like
blood.
they
put
the
car
on
a
rack
and
found
underneath
the
car
some
hairy
substance
and
--
and
blood
under
the
steering
mechanism,
underneath
the
car.
putting
all
of
those
bits
of
evidence
and
envelops
for
marking,
they
took
it
to
the
courthouse
of
jefferson
parish
for
it
to
be
taken
to
the
laboratory
for
testing.
all
of
these
evidence
disappeared.
the
only
thing
that
remained
was
these
photographs
that
were
made
by
the
investigating
officers
showing
the
deceased
and
the
car
itself.
faced
with
this
evidence
as
to
the
damage
to
his
automobile,
confronted
with
that,
he
was
asked
by
these
officers."
well,
how
did
that
happen?"
his
answer
to
them
was,
"well,
i
hit
a
cow."
and
then
they
kept
pressing
him
about
that
and
then
he
changed
the
story
and
said,
"no,
i
ran
into
a
truck
before
i
went
down
to
grand
isle,
i
was
going
along
the
road
and
ran
into
rear
of
a
stake
body
truck.
and
i
damaged
my
car
that
way
and
a
piece
of
wood
fell
out
of
the
truck
and
hit
my
car
and
i
ran
off
the
road
but
i
came
back
on
the
road."
so
the
officers
took
him
out
there
to
the
scene
where
he
said
he
had
this
wreck
before
he
went
to
grand
isle
and
asked
him
to
point
out
where
it
was.
and
the
officers
testified
that
if
he
had
--
there's
no
marking
there
at
all
of
showing
a
car
going
off
the
road.
he
--
he
estimated
100
--
a
150
feet,
he
went
off
the
road
but
there's
no
tire
marks
at
all
showing
that
the
car
had
--
any
card
had
gone
of
the
road.
and
had
there
been
a
car
that
--
going
off
the
road
at
that
point,
it
was
so
soggy
and
mud
--
muddy
that
the
car
couldn't
have
gotten
out
itself
and
it
would
have
been
pulled
out.
but
yet,
he
stuck
to
that
story.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no.
it
happened
on
--
on
the
way
up
to
the
bar
before
he
started
down
to
the
grand
isle,
it
--
around
noon
that
sunday.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it
wouldn't
--
and
then
he
went
on
to
grand
isle
after
he
had
this
--
bumped
into
the
back
end
of
this
truck.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
to
sell
this
automo
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
that's
right,
sir.
but
on
this
--
on
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
--
the
demeanor,
the
alibis,
the
change
of
story
of
this
--
of
this
suspect,
of
this
defendant
is
all
important
in
this
case
and
--
and
was
a
determinant
factor
of
the
jury
reaching
the
decision
that
it
did
in
my
opinion.
an
additional
factor,
this
man
sold
his
business,
interest
in
--
in
his
partnership
of
this
automobile
agency
to
his
brother.
about
seven
days
after
this
--
mercer,
the
deceased
here
was
found.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it
was
all
--
of
course
it
was
brought
before
the
--
for
the
jury
by
the
--
all
of
the
officers
were
put
on
the
stand
and
they
were
asked,
"where
was
this
evidence?
here
we
can
resolve
this
thing
without
any
question
at
all."
and
--
and
they
all
testified,
of
course
that
it
--
that
it
had
disappeared.
they
didn't
know
what
happened
to
it.
and
the
--
and
the
--
one
of
the
state
of
--
officers
who
investigated
this
was
asked
a
question
on
cross
examination
that
was
there,
a
payoff
and
he
stated
that
he
heard
that
there
was.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
i
asked
that
question
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
on
direct
examination,
i
mean
on
cross
examination
without
any
objection
and
the
--
and
the
attorney
representing
the
defendant
who
is
not
mr.
loeb
here
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
didn't
--
went
into
it
farther
on
these
questions
of
payoff.
and
it
was
just
generally
rumored
that
there
had
been
a
payoff
and
the
rim
never
did
show
up.
and
i
--
i'll
--
i'll
go
into
that
a
little
later
with
regard
to
the
mandate,
try
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
after
the
case
went
up
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
judge,
i
took
the
--
the
depositions
of
all
--
all
of
these
officials
over
again,
even
after
the
trial.
and
one
officer
would
--
would
say,
"i
heard
that
(inaudible)
was
paid
$10,000
to
hide
this
rim
and
destroy
the
evidence."
and
then
take
the
--
(inaudible)
deposition,
he
would
deny
it
and
say,
"no,
i
heard
that
the
officer
dolph
(inaudible)
got
the
$10,000."
so
it
was
just
one
to
the
other,
accusing
each
other
of
getting
the
$10,000
but
all
denying
it.
and
--
and
that
was
what
we
were
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
all
agreeing.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
--
they
all
agreed
that
the
evidence
was
gathered
and
it
had
--
and
it
all
disappeared.
and
the
only
--
and
the
reason
as
i
say
that
the
pictures
didn't
disappear
because
an
officer
had
the
negatives
in
his
home.
and
i
found
out
about
the
pictures
and
got
copies
of
the
prints
made
from
these
negatives
which
prints
are
in
the
evidence
here
before
--
before
the
court.
and
--
and
with
--
with
that,
the
circumstances,
as
i've
outlined
generally
here,
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no
it
didn't,
judge
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
--
our
basic
tort
law
is
in
one
article
of
the
civil
code,
article
2315
which
uses
the
word
"fault"
--
he
--
to
cause
it
by
damage
by
fault
but
is
synonymous
with
the
court's
inter
--
that
is
being
negligence.
and
the
--
and
the
general
principles
of
negligence
of
the
law
is
the
same
in
louisiana
as
all
the
rest
of
the
states.of
course,
we
come
--
we
base
it
on
our
napoleonic
code
but
it
--
rather
than
the
common
law.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
proximate
cause,
all
of
those
terms,
we
have
the
same
there.
we
have
a
comparative
negligence
in
our
code
but
the
--
the
courts
have
adopted
the
common
law
rule
and
of
--
of
contributory
negligence
rather
than
comparative
negligence.
other
than
that,
we
are
pretty
well
in
line,
the
only
--
the
only
difference
we
have
with
regard
to
trying
negligence
cases
down
in
louisiana
is
we
don't
have
a
infective
civil
jury
trial
in
our
state
because
the
appellate
court
can
do
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
did
here
and
that
was,
make
its
own
determinations
of
fact
and
substitute
its
determination
of
fact
for
that
of
the
jury.
and
that's
the
reason
wherein
we
have
the
diversity
of
citizenship.
we
bring
our
cases
in
the
federal
court
in
order
to
get
an
effective
jury
trial.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
but
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
where
the
only
state
in
the
union
that
allows
that.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
the
--
the
appellate
court
to
substitute
its
own
findings
of
fact
for
that
of
the
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it's
the
trial
de
novo
on
appeal,
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
that's
exactly
right
and
that's
the
reason
i
brought
it
here.
but
then
i
was
faced
with
the
--
this
reversal
in
the
--
by
the
fifth
circuit
with
a
--
with
a
mandate
that
is
unparalleled.
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
precedent
for
the
type
of
mandate
that
was
attached
to
the
remand
and
reversal
in
this
case
in
the
--
in
the
entire
jurisprudence
of
this
court
or
any
other
state.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
we
have
the
framework
for
it.
the
procedure
for
it
was
there
are
few,
the
jury
trials
in
the
state
court
in
civil
matters.
and
many
of
the
jurisdictions
--
i've
tried
the
first
jury
trial
for
--
in
a
civil
matter
that's
ever
been
tried
in
the
history
of
the
--
the
whole
district.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
they
just
--
they
just
--
make
its
own
finding
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
from
the
cole
record.
and
that's
the
reason
you
have
so
few
jury
trials
in
the
state
court
in
louisiana.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
brought
it
in
--
in
the
forum
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
in
order
to
get
an
effective
jury
trial.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
that's
the
usual
thing
to
do.
for
example,
we
can
file
a
suit
direct
against
the
insurance
company
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
without
naming
the
insured
and
this
court
has
upheld
in
the
landmark
decisions
insofar
as
we
are
concerned
in
louisiana.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
organ
of
one
of
those
decisions
upholding
the
--
that
statute.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no
--
no,
i
would
--
it
may
have
influenced
it,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
because
of
course
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
sir?
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
and
--
and
it
shouldn't
--
shouldn't
have
been.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
because
we
and
the
--
we
and
the
federal
court
here
and
the
rules
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
laid
down
by
this
court
in
--
in
countless
decisions
that
where
you
have
a
--
a
conflict
in
evidence
and
--
and
inferences
may
be
drawn
by
that
conflicting
evidence
by
a
jury
and
the
jury
makes
that
decision
then
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
in
fact
that
that
jury
verdict
stands.
and
that
it
is
not
permissible
for
the
appellate
court,
the
circuit
court
to
substitute
or
make
a
redertermination
or
to
weigh
the
evidence
in
order
to
--
to
make
a
determination
of
the
facts
itself.
and
often
times,
in
many
decisions
of
this
court,
you
have
upheld
the
jury
verdict
even
though
if
you
were
called
upon
to
make
that
decision
of
finding
the
fact,
you
wouldn't
have
--
have
made
the
same
finding
of
fact.
and
i
think
that
--
that's
true
in
the
diversity
cases
of
mr.
--
either
justice
goldberg
in
one
of
a
case
that
i
found
that
--
that
is
as
close
to
this
as
--
as
any
case
that
--
was
the
dick
case
versus
new
york
life.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
was
the
organ
of
the
court,
a
question
of
--
of
whether
or
not
on
a
--
on
a
policy
it
was
an
accidental
death
or
suicide
and
a
--
the
shot
of
a
gun
going
off
and
--
and
the
jury
found
that
it
was
an
accident,
not
suicide.
in
--
and
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
it
and
this
court
reinstated
that
jury
verdict
by
--
by
stating
that
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
to
--
to
support
that
finding
of
the
jury.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well,
that's
true.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it
--
that's
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
the
federal
standard
when
it
should
be
and
i
know
this
many
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
you
don't
get
that
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
in
the
federal
court.
and
--
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule,
you'd
have
to
use
the
federal
rule
on
that
because
we
just
don't
have
one
in
louisiana,
and
that's
just
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
we
cannot
upset
it.
and
--
and
that
is
the
--
the
position
that
that
we
take
here
and
--
and
when
the
--
and
when
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
remanded
this
case
that
attached
to
it
a
mandate
to
go
out
and
--
and
find
some
--
some
evidence
that
would
support
a
jury
verdict
and
have
a
--
some
sort
of
a
hearing
before
the
trial
judge
and
then
he
would
decide
whether
or
not
that
should
be
at
--
a
trial
by
jury.
i
--
i
just
--
i
was
frustrated
in
--
excuse
me.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
11
minutes,
i
believe
i
have
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
enough
for
rebuttal.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
thank
you
--
thank
you
sir.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
chief
justice,
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
the
--
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
defendant
killed
byrd
(ph)
mercer.
now,
in
--
in
viewing
the
entire
record,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
that
evidence
in
this
record
regardless
of
--
of
the
depositions
and
other
steps
that
were
taken
like
the
report
from
the
accident
analyst
and
the
deposition
of
witnesses
that
didn't
appear
at
the
trial.
irregardless
of
that,
the
evidence
as
educed
on
the
trial
with
the
merits
of
this
case
before
the
jury
was
sufficient
to
--
to
make
a
jury
question
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence.
there
were
denials
by
the
defendant.
there
were
--
there
was
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
there
were
circumstances,
there
were
physical
evidence,
there
were
photographs,
there
was
a
timing,
there
were
all
of
these
--
the
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
draw
inferences
and
wherever
you
have
that
situation
as
i
appreciate
the
countless
decisions
handed
out
by
this
court
that
where
you
have
a
conflict
of
evidence
and
you
--
you
have
it
at
that
stage
where
the
jury
can
draw
inferences
and
arrive
at
a
decision
and
reach
a
decision
as
to
the
fact
then
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
and
as
a
jury
question.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
well
--
well
with
--
with
the
man
walking
down
the
road,
on
the
shoulder
of
the
road,
we
had
a
right
to
be
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
sir?
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
because
his
body
was
found
there
and
he
was
last
seen
alive
at
the
wharf,
he's
going
his
way
home.
he
was
going
to
walk
home
and
not
ride.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
but
with
the
--
with
the
evidence
as
shown
by
the
photographs
of
the
tire
marks,
his
position
as
he
was
lying
there
on
the
shoulder
of
the
road,
the
--
the
blue
coloring
on
the
car
that
struck
him
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
now
--
now,
the
negligence
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
over
on
the
shoulder
of
the
road
and
you
have
the
deceased
there.
that
it
--
that
if
you
prove
that,
say
that
you
had
a
witness
that
was
out
there
in
that
swamp
and
saw
theriot
drove
--
drive
off
onto
the
shoulder
of
the
road
as
mercer
was
walking
along
on
the
shoulder
of
that
road,
that
would
be
direct
proof
of
negligence
under
the
law
of
louisiana.
because
he
wasn't
keeping
a
proper
lookout
and
because
he
had
the
last
clear
chance
if
nothing
else,
even
if
--
if
the
deceased
was
negligent
himself
in
walking
along
on
that
dark
road.
the
duties
is
up
on
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
in
louisiana
to
keep
his
car
on
a
proper
control
to
see
what
he
should've
seen,
to
see
all
--
to
be
able
to
stop
his
car
within
the
range
division
of
his
lights
and
by
not
doing
that
then
that
would
be
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
showing
negligence,
which
negligence
was
approximate
cause
of
his
death.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
if
he
ran
off
of
the
--
off
of
his
lane
of
traffic,
of
the
--
the
asphalt
portion
of
the
highway
and
ran
into
a
pedestrian
on
the
shoulder
of
the
highway
as
his
back
was
to
the
driver
of
the
automobile
that
would
be
absolute
passive
evidence
of
negligence
without
any
question.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
for
negligent
--
homicide?
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir.
the
--
the
inference
of
the
fact
that
he
hit
and
run
is
a
--
is
a
--
is
an
inference
that
can
be
drawn.
and
--
and
of
course
in
a
civil
case
as
your
honor
knows,
he
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
it
beyond
a
--
a
reasonable
doubt
as
it
if
--
it
was
a
criminal
case.
but
here,
you
--
you're
not
bound
with
that
just
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
i
--
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
oh,
there
was
uncontradicted
evidence,
he
--
the
defendant
admitted
himself
that
he
had
been
drinking
all
afternoon.
he
--
he
didn't
admit
to
the
number
of
--
of
the
drinks
that
he
had
--
that
he
--
that
the
bartender
served
him
but
he
did
admit
that
he
had
been
drinking
there
all
afternoon.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
yes
sir,
under
the
influence
of
liquor,
yes
sir,
that
in
itself.
there's
many
in
the
--
instances
where
the
negligence
is
--
is
presumed.
i'm
making
a
left
hand
turn
and
--
and
passing
a
car
on
a
bridge
is
all
--
all
types
of
situations
where
presumptions
can
be
drawn
and
inferences
where
a
fact
situation
is
produced.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
(inaudible)
off
of
it,
some
about
two
of
three
feet
off
of
the
asphalt
portion
of
the
highway.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
it's
a
grass,
it
was
grass.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
no,
but
the
tire
tracks
are
shown
in
the
grass
itself.
the
grass
was
rather
high
and
they
were
still
there,
went
--
in
the
next
morning
when
the
photograph
of
the
body
was
taken
as
shown
in
these
photographs,
the
--
the
tire
track.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
he
must
have
been.
the
right
--
and
you
see
it
all
fixed
because
he's
walking
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
road
and
the
car
is
coming
from
his
back
and
the
right
fender
and
the
right
headlight
was
what
was
damaged
and
the
right
portion
of
the
hood.
so
when
that
body
hit
the
fender
and
headlight
hit
the
body,
it
slipped
him
apparently
because
when
he
went
right
on
over
the
--
the
--
there's
a
big
dent
in
the
hood
near
the
windshield
as
the
body
was
clipped
--
clipped
over.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
and
then
either
clipped
or
just
flipped
all
away
over,
of
course
you
can't
tell
but
the
--
but
with
the
body
landing,
it
was
right
faced
down
and
the
tracks
are
right
there.
so
when
he
flipped,
he's
riding
the
path.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
he
could
very
well
have
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
he
couldn't
have
stayed
there.
it
knocked
him
off
to
the
end
of
the
ditch
but
it
--
but
apparently
it
just
--
they
flipped
him
over
and
he
landed
right
in
the
tracks
and
the
pool
of
blood
was
there
as
one
of
the
deputies
who
investigated
was
found
right
in
the
--
in
the
truck
itself.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
mr.
justice
black,
he
had
this
overall
zone
with
blue
denim
and
the
--
the
officers
who
took
the
scrapings
of
it,
that
was
in
the
dented
part
of
the
--
of
the
hood,
took
the
scrapings
off,
he
said
there
was
a
poor
slack
like
--
like
it
was
a
fabric.
and
then
--
and
of
course
analysis
of
--
and
a
laboratory
would
have
proved
indefinite
but
his
testimony
was
as
an
investigating
officer
was
that
it
came
from
the
blue
denim
of
his
overalls
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
--
question
about
that.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
and
that
was
what
was
destroyed
and
we
had
the
skulduggeries
as
judge
reeves
call
it
in
the
--
in
the
destruction
of
this
evidence
which
brought
all
of
this
invalid
but
--
but
i
--
that
--
this
pinpoints
to
me
the
--
the
greatness
of
a
jury
trial
and
--
and
where
the
determination
of
the
facts
where
you
have
sufficient
evidence
produced,
where
the
circumstance,
physical
or
by
eyewitness
to
have
that
determinative
facts,
be
a
judge
or
jury
to
see
these
witnesses
and
hear
them
and
not
make
a
determination
of
fact
from
a
cold
record.
because
it's
--
it's
just
not
the
same
and
--
and
just
like
judge
wright
said,
when
he
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
this
case
after
the
verdict
came
in
from
the
jury,
he
says
no
one
who
sat
through
this
case
and
heard
these
witnesses
could
come
to
no
other
conclusion
but
that
what
the
jury
did.
and
then
when
he
came
back
down
and
after
it
was
remanded
with
his
mandate
and
after
it
went
through
these
other
depositions
trying
to
find
some
evidence
that
had
been
destroyed
by
this
someone
--
one
pointing
to
the
other.
judge
wright
made
this
statement
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
read
it
for
you
because
to
me
that
--
even
if
he
had
tried
this
case
without
a
jury,
there
had
been
no
--
no
question
of
what
decision
he
would
have
rendered
because
here's
what
he
said.
there
isn't
any
question
in
my
mind
that
that
there
was
a
denial
of
justice
in
this
case.
there
isn't
any
question
in
my
mind
either
that
paris
theriot
killed
this
man.
now,
how
can
you
have
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
the
state
court
before
a
jury
and
a
judge
and
still
have
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
for
the
defendant.
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
had
he
changed
his
mind
and
he
--
mr.
h.
alva
brumfield
right
judge
and
i
--
i
beg
judge
wright,
has
said,
i
--
he
--
he
was
on
the
impression
that
--
that
the
mandate
provided
that
--
that
the
plaintiff
had
defined
additional
evidence.
and
of
course
judge
wisdom
in
his
decision
says
that
that's
the
only
interpretation
of
it.
but
--
but
if
the
case
had
been
retried
and
resubmitted
on
the
exact
evidence,
there
was
educed
at
the
first
trial,
the
decision
would
still
have
been
the
same.
and
that's
the
reason
we
are
here
now
and
asking
this
court
to
reverse
this
case
and
render
and
that
is
restore
the
jury
of
verdict
as
there
is
no
need
for
a
new
trial
in
this
case.the
evidence
has
been
educed.
thank
you
very
much.
