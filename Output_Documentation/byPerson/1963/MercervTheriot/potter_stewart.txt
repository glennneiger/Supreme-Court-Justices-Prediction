justice
potter
stewart
his
story
was
that
he
had
had
this
--
this
had
happened
on
his
way
from
golden
meadow
after
grand
isle,
back
there?
justice
potter
stewart
that
sunday,
that
same
day.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
his
story
before
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
--
on
his
--
and
--
and
then
later,
he
went
over
to
grand
isle
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
about
selling
the
automobile.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
brought
before
the
jury
that
some
of
his
evidence
had
disappeared
that
they've
been
collected
by
the
officers?
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
who
asked
that
question,
defence
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
you
asked
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
except
for
the
general
rumor
of
a
payoff
that
was
testified
to?
and
except
for
the
testimony
that
the
evidence
had
disappeared,
was
there
anything
more
specific
as
to
how
or
where
or
to
whom
it
had
been
--
the
evidence
had
disappeared?
justice
potter
stewart
all
agreeing
that
there
had
been
evidence
which
had
disappeared.
justice
potter
stewart
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
go
ahead.
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
allows
what?
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
it's
in
effect
the
trial
de
novo
of
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
state
system.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
get
it,
do
you?
going
to
the
--
and
the
reason
you
--
you've
--
if
you
have
diversity
of
citizenship
that
a
plaintiff
will
go
on
to
the
federal
court
as
to
avoid
that
in
the
federal
system.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
--
the
usual
thing
to
do,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
you're
saying
that
so
far
as
the
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
a
court
of
appeals
goes,
that's
been
settled
(inaudible)
--
that
if
--
once
you're
in
the
federal
courts,
you
don't
get
that.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
--
what
--
what
piece
of
evidence
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
what
he
himself
had
seen.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
loeb
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
doesn't
it
remain
true
in
louisiana
and
as
i
understand
it
uniquely
in
louisiana
that
an
appellate
court,
even
if
it
might
find
that
the
evidence
were
sufficient
to
support
a
particular
finding
of
fact
could
--
would
still
have
the
power
to
say,
nonetheless,
we
think
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shows
the
facts
to
be
just
the
opposite
and
we
therefore
are
so
find.
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
that
extent,
you
don't
--
you're
not
limited
by
efficiency
of
the
evidence
standard
as
are
the
federal
courts
and
are
--
as
are
the
courts
of
all
the
other
states
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
be
unfair.
i'm
really
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rephrased
my
question
anyway.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
may
i
interrupt
to
ask
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
do
they
have
that
power
even
if
it's
assumed
that
there
might
be
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
triers
of
findings.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
it
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
--
because
that's
a
--
you
rephrase
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
i
suppose
if
--
if
the
federal
rule
were
to
be
found
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases,
for
instance
and
that
is
--
it
might
differ
somewhat
at
least
from
the
--
the
rule
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
standards
and
--
and
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
that's
ever
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
verbalized
that
way.
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree
with
you
that
