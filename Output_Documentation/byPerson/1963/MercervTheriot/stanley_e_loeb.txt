mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
brumfield
has
stated
the
facts
of
the
case
and
i
would
like
to
pick
up
in
the
discussion
of
the
dick
versus
new
york
life
insurance
company
decision,
which
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
has
left
open
the
question
of
whether
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
is
--
could
be
measured
by
state
law
or
by
federal
law.
that
might
be
an
open
question
but
in
the
same
decision,
there
is
found
the
falsity
of
statement
that
under
the
area
rule,
presumptions
and
burden
of
proof
in
the
diversity
case
are
substantive
in
the
matters
of
state
law.
and
the
law
of
louisiana,
the
substantive
law
of
louisiana
presumes
that
a
motorist
or
everybody
else
obeys
the
law.
there
is
no
presumption
of
negligence,
presumption
as
it
--
just
to
the
contrary.
and
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court
are
clear
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
predicated
on
article
2315
of
our
civil
code
which
is
cited
on
the
first
page
of
respondent's
brief
in
a
footnote
puts
upon
the
plaintiff
the
burden
of
proof
of
all
the
elements
necessary
to
establish
liability.
in
a
case
like
this
where
there
was
no
witness
to
the
accident,
the
first
element
of
proof
is
that
this
--
the
defendant
was
a
party
to
the
accident.
and
the
second
element,
which
had
--
the
defendant
was
negligent.
now,
this
case,
after
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiff
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
chief
judge
--
then
chief
judge
hutcheson
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court.
and
he
carefully
avoided
reference
to
any
state
decision
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict,
number
one.
and
second,
that
the
record
was
literally
thought
with
reversible
error.
apparently,
the
reversible
error
question
is
not
before
your
honors.
it
was
not
raised
in
petitioner's
brief
and
i
comment
it
in
respondent's
brief,
that
such
was
the
case
on
page
14.
i
--
the
comment
is
made
that
petitioner
has
not
discussed
in
her
brief
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
appeal
that
there
was
reversible
error.
but
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
believe
so.
i
believe
it's
before
you.
perhaps
i
used
the
wrong
word
mr.
justice
black.
it's
before
you,
the
whole
case
is
before
you
but
i
meant
that
the
issue
hasn't
been
raised
in
petitioner's
--
either
petition
or
in
their
brief
in
this
particular
case.
the
problem
now
seems
to
be
directed
toward
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
appeal.
and
it
is
as
mr.
brumfield
has
pointed
out
a
most
unusual
mandate.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
attention
was
attracted
by
the
mandate
in
its
respect
to
the
seventh
amendment.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
will
read
the
mandate."
because
however,
evidence
as
distinguished
from
rumor
and
speculation
as
to
the
why
and
how
of
the
death
of
plaintiff-decedent
and
as
to
the
responsibility
of
the
defendant
for
it,
may
have
been
or
maybe
discovered.
we
order
the
judgment
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
with
directions
to
enter
a
judgment
for
defendant.
unless
plaintiff,
within
a
time
and
under
considerations
to
be
fixed
by
the
district
judge,
makes
a
satisfactory
showing
that
on
another
trial,
evidence
of
sufficient
probative
force
to
justify
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
will
be
open.
in
which
case,
the
judgment
shall
be
for
a
new
trial."
so
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
allow
the
plaintiff
to
make
out
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
district
judge,
with
judge
wright,
that
on
another
trial
she
could
produce
evidence
of
sufficient
probative
force
--
force
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury.
now,
what
happened
was,
plaintiff
timely
filed
an
appropriate
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
in
support
of
that
motion
and
on
the
order
of
the
district
court,
some
nine
or
10
depositions
were
taken
including
the
depositions
of
some
of
the
witnesses
who
had
testified
on
the
trial.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
an
ex
parte
report
from
an
accident
technician
or
purported
accident
technician
which
was
all
submitted
to
judge
wright.
judge
wright
considered
the
motion
and
the
evidence
submitted
in
support
of
the
motion
in
light
of
the
mandate
and
ruled
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
evidence
submitted
in
support
of
the
mandate
to
--
to
support
the
conclusion
that
on
another
trial
there
would
be
probative
evidence
that
could
go
to
the
jury.
therefore,
he
refused
the
new
trial.
plaintiff
asked
for
a
rehearing
and
the
rehearing
was
granted.
the
argument
was
heard.
and
if
the
court
please,
that
was
when
i
came
into
the
case.
my
predecessor,
who
is
mr.
robert
g.
hughes,
was
elected
to
the
bench
after
the
case
was
tried
and
after
the
case
was
argued
and
after
the
fifth
circuit
had
ruled
on
it.
and
i
came
into
the
case
when
he
was
elevated
to
the
state
bench
and
picked
it
up
at
the
second
--
at
the
first
rehearing,
the
second
argument
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
before
judge
wright.
judge
wright
again
considered
and
refused
a
new
trial.
thereupon,
plaintiff
appealed
again
to
the
court
of
appeals
seeking
review
and
getting
review
of
judge
wright's
rulings.
that
case
was
argued
to
a
panel
of
the
court
and
a
few
weeks
thereafter,
counsel
were
notified
that
the
panel
would
submit
it
to
the
whole
court
en
banc
and
additional
briefs
could
be
submitted,
that
was
done
and
the
whole
court
considered
the
matter
and
rendered
the
opinion
in
the
second
appeal
affirming
judge
wright's
refusal
of
a
new
trial
by
a
divided
court,
five-to-four
with
chief
judge
reeves
filing
a
dissent.
in
his
dissent,
it's
leveled
with
the
seventh
amendment
and
that
raises
in
my
mind
the
notion
that
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case
whether
the
mandate,
the
original
mandate,
has
done
violence
to
the
seventh
amendment,
because
i
know
this
court
is
busy
and
has
not
concerned
itself
with
the
particular
facts
of
a
particular
diversity
suit.
but
the
--
the
seventh
amendment
feature
of
the
case
is
the
important
one
as
i
see
it.
now,
in
the
slocum
case,
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
van
devanter
said
in
19
--
i
think
1930
that,
"everything
of
a
phiso
--
philosophical
nature
concerning
the
seventh
amendment
which
could
be
said
at
that
time
had
been
said.
and
there
was
little
to
be
added
to
it.
that
the
seventh
amendment
restricted
the
scope
of
appellate
review
to
the
--
that
is
in
--
in
federal
court,
to
the
common
law
as
it
existed
in
1791,
which
interpreted
means
that
where
the
suf
--
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
grounds
for
a
reversal.
the
court
could
grant
a
new
trial
and
nothing
more."
that
was
the
rule
of
common
law
in
effect
in
1791.
now,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
mandate
which
i
just
read
does
not
order
a
new
trial,
nor
does
it
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
seventh
amendment
because
in
the
case
of
gasoline
--
and
it's
cited
in
my
brief,
products
company
versus
champlin
which
is
380
--
283
u.s.
494.
this
court
held
that
the
seventh
amendment
guarantee
did
not
restrict
the
appellate
courts
to
the
procedure
of
the
common
law
of
1791.
and
the
opinion
says,
"we're
not
concerned
with
form,
we're
concerned
with
the
substance
of
the
amendment."
and
the
modern
practice
even
then,
was
not
to
be
circumscribed
because
of
just
blind
adherence
to
the
old
forms.
now,
in
1960,
when
this
case
was
remanded,
it
was
remanded
with
--
and
thought
in
mind
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
provided
the
mechanics,
the
tools
whereby
the
district
court
could
ascertain
in
advance
of
another
trial
whether
the
judge
would
be
constrained
to
direct
the
verdict
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
testimony.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened.
the
plaintiff
had
unrestricted
opportunity
and
did
produce
all
of
the
witnesses
he
could
possibly
find.
those
witnesses,
as
counsel
told
you
in
his
argument,
testified
--
well
officer
prudom
(ph)
said
it.
and
officer
prudom
(ph)
testified
that
officer
gidrey
(ph)
said
it
and
it
was
a
hodge-podge
of
conflicting
rumor,
speculation
and
guess
work.
the
whole
record
is
here,
the
original
depositions
of
those
witnesses
are
in
the
record.
and
on
the
second
appeal,
the
--
which
even
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
reeves
pointed
out
that
it
was
just
a
conglomerate
mass
of
hearsay
which
would
be
inadmissible.
however,
judge
reeves
thought
that
there
was
one
piece
of
evidence
there
that
was
sufficient
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury.
and
that
was
apparently
the
reason
for
his
dissent.
but
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it
was
a
two
--
a
statement
by
one
of
the
policemen
concerning
what
he
saw
at
the
scene
and
what
he
said
he
saw
at
the
scene
of
the
accident.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
he
himself,
concerning
some
track
--
track
marks.
but
of
course
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
vehicle
made
the
track
marks.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
but
except
for
that
one
piece
of
evidence
which
this
--
the
patrolman
said
he
saw.
the
rest
of
it
is
merely
speculation.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
well
sir,
that
had
been
an
open
question
since
the
dick
decision
and
i
believe
that
i'm
not
going
to
evade
your
question,
mr.
justice,
but
i
believe
whatever
standard
that
might
be
applied
in
this
case,
be
it
state
or
federal,
and
reading
of
the
record
and
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
opinion,
will
immediately
show
that
a
remand
was
necessary.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
to
support
the
verdict.
and
beyond
that,
there
were
many
instances
of
reversible
error.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
oh,
they
did.
they
did
sir.
they
used
the
right
standard.
and
whatever
standard
they
might
have
used,
it
would
have
been
the
same.
i
doubt
that
the
federal
standard
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
--
if
there'd
be
one.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
think
there
is
and
i
would
differ
with
the
counsel
there.
there
is
because
whereas
all
appellate
courts
have
the
power,
the
constitutional
power
in
our
state
constitution
to
review
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
--
by
--
by
the
finders
of
fact,
judge
or
jury.
there
still
is
a
standard
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
fact,
be
it
a
verdict
or
finding
of
fact
by
a
judge.
and
it's
a
very
real
standard.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
no
difference.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
no
different
from
the
standard
in
any
other
state
because
counsel
properly
told
you
that
our
state
law
of
torts
is
the
general
--
it
has
no
gimmicks
in
it.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
what
the
federal
standard
of
review
is.
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
separate
standard.
in
the
dick
case,
mr.
chief
justice
left
the
question
open
and
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
no.
i
would
say
no.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
sufficient
evidence.
evidence
of
such
property
force
as
would
cause
man
of
intelligence
do
differ.
that
seems
to
be
the
standard
in
louisiana
and
if
there
be
a
federal
standard,
mr.
justice
white
i
suggest
that
that
would
apparently
be
it.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
--
i'm
afraid
that
that
is
stated
in
such
a
way
mr.
justice
that
it
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it's
difficult
to
answer.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
well,
as
the
--
the
appellate
courts
do
have
the
power
to
find
facts
different
from
the
--
that
--
those
facts
found
by
the
trier
of
fact.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
didn't
get
that.
that
they
have
the
power
regardless,
they
have
the
power.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
but,
there
is
the
uniform
rule
established
by
the
jurisprudent
that
the
power
will
never
be
exercised
except
in
case
of
palpable
error.
now,
if
there's
no
error
shown
by
the
record,
the
--
the
appellate
courts
under
the
jurisprudence
and
the
recent
jurisprudence
of
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
--
under
that
rule,
which
is
firmly
established,
the
appellate
courts
shall
not
interfere
with
the
finding
of
fact
unless
there
is
apparent
error
on
the
part
of
the
trier
of
fact.
so
you
do
have
a
rule,
a
very
real
rule,
which
is
adhered
to.
now,
of
course,
in
louisiana
we
have
four
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
the
intermediary
courts
and
one
supreme
court.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
tell
you
that
every
case
where
one
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
might
undertake
to
reverse
a
jury
or
--
or
a
judge
--
trial
judge.
that
in
every
case
there
is
palpable
error
that
the
court
thinks
so
because
they
are
--
they
are
bound,
they
did
--
the
courts
of
appeal
are
bound
by
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court
on
the
circuit.
so
we
do
have
a
rule
and
i
doubt
as
i
say
it
again,
except
for
the
scintilla
rule
which
i
don't
know
whether
that
constitutes
a
federal
rule
or
not.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it
might
and
it
would
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it
might
at
a
workmen's
compensation
situation.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it
certainly
would.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
it
certainly
would.
and
if
--
of
course
we
were
trying
in
the
state
court
a
jones
act
suit.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
an
fela
case.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
the
scintilla
rule
would
apply.
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
don't
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
don't
know.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
but
certainly
the
--
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
the
burden
--
the
extent
of
proof
necessary
would
not
be
as
great
and
that
--
incidentally,
that
is
apparent
in
this
record
and
in
the
briefs
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner,
their
mostly
fela
cases.
but
even
this
court
in
an
fela
case
and
the
moore
case,
moore
versus
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
railroad,
reviewed
the
effect
--
justice
--
fifth
circuit
did
here
and
found
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
--
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
not
only
of
a
--
they
exposed
to,
they
are
bound
to
by
--
by
our
civil
code
and
by
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
i
would
--
oh
yes.
except
--
except
for
that
instance
which
was
very
important
because
the
correction
didn't
occur
until
long
after.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
correct,
judge
wright
correctly
stated
the
law
of
louisiana
on
--
on
negligence.
mr.
stanley
e.
loeb
please
--
mr.
stanley
e.
