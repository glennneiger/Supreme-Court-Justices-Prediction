justice

did
the

did
the
speeches
urged
entering
the

justice

(inaudible)
who
are
urging
a
boycott
and
urging
people
to
enter
classrooms
and
that
to
have
people
leave
their
classes.
justice
byron
r.
white
convicted
for
both
of
that?
justice
byron

white
given
one
--
what
was
it?
a
fine
or
jail
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
a
fine
or
a
jail
--
justice
byron
r.
white
both
and
given
one
--
one
sentence
anyway
for
both
sentences.
you
see
something
fundamentally
wrong
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

let's
assume
there'd
been
two
counts
in
the
information.
one
charging
6,
one
charging
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
convictions
on
both
concurrent
sentences
on
both
and
7
was
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
--
why
is
it
different
from
what
we
have
here,
assuming
--
assuming
for
the
moment
--
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there
was
a
--
that
this
information
charged
defenses
under
both
6
and
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
trial
judge
ever
--
did
the
trial
judge
ever
say
to
himself
that
he
was
convicting
under
6?
justice
byron

white
page

of
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
indictment
or
information
charged
to
violation
of
5,
6
and
7.
you're
saying
that
the
--
that
the
charge
was
conjunctive
and
that
if
the
judge
found
him
guilty
beyond
reasonable
doubt
and
he's
finding
them
guilty
of
each
and
everyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
--
and
this
is
as
though
and
--
and
your
position
is
that
it
is
as
though
they
were
set
out
in
separate
counts
and
he
found
them
guilty
on
all
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
it's
illegal
to
make
a
speech
urging
students
to
enter
classrooms.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
that
--
that
it
seems
to
me
only
if
that
the
judge
didn't
find
them
guilty
of
both
and
you
can't
tell,
what
he
found
them
guilty
of.
what
if
he
found
guilty
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
he
found
guilty
of
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
found
them
guilty
of
both
two
offenses
(voice
overlap)
one
valid
and
one
invalid,
but
he
did
find
them
guilty
of
both
and
gave
them
one
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
states
point
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
states
point
is
of
course,
that
when
you
--
when
you
get
two
matters
charged
conjunctively
and
information
like
this
and
the
judge
finds
him
guilty,
it
means
he
did
find
him
guilty
on
both.
that's
their
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
--
but
he
did
--
assuming
he
found
them
guilty
of
exhorting
people
to
march
as
well
as
they're
guilty
of
something
else
that
perhaps
couldn't
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
even
if
the
trial
judge
did
find
that
your
client
is
guilty
of
two
different
offenses
charged
in
the
single
count.
he
found
them
guilty
of
both
--
absolutely
both,
it
was
clear
that
he
did.
if
one
is
valid
and
one
invalid,
why
wouldn't
you
argue
that
this
--
that
the
--
which
you
do
but
--
but
for
a
different
reason,
why
wouldn't
argue
that
it's
bad
because
of
--
because
a
fine
might
have
been
half
that.
if
--
or
that
the
sentence
or
the
jail
sentence
might've
half
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
--
which
is
a
different
that
it
had
been
--
they
had
been
charged
in
separate
counts
then
he
had
assessed
it,
the
same
penalty
for
each
count
concurrently.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
number
6
does
not
--
does
not
fairly
give
you
notice
that
--
that
going
through
classrooms
at
a
university
is
illegal.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
warrant
and
how
about
one
speech,
one
speech
that
urges
people
to
go
through
classrooms
and
pull
the
students
out
of
it?
now,
does
number
6
give
you
adequate
notice
if
that
is
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
stipulate
with
that
you
did
made
one
speech
urging
students
to
go
the
classroom
and
pull
students
out.
number
6,
section
6
would've
been
ample
notice
if
that
was
an
--
an
acceptable
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron

it's

other
states
