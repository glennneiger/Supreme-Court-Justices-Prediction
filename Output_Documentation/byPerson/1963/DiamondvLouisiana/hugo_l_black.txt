(inaudible)
filed
february
13,
is
that
in
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
goes
for
another
one
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
did
it
take
the
place
of
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
one
on
which
he
was
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
amendments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
ever
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
i
thought
you
agreed
that
he
was
tried
on
the
one
on
page
1.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
against
the
law
to
urge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
someone
to
urge
students
to
leave
school
and
disturbed
the
school
against
the
law
of
the
state,
are
you
saying
that,
not
what
you're
charging
here
or
are
saying
that
the
constitution
forbids
you
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
defend
themselves,
you
--
you're
not
defending
that
clause
of
your
law,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
first
by
telling
me
which
section
of
the
statute
are
you
depending
on,
which
subdivision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
5
and
6.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
charge
him
withholding
an
unlawful
assembly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
holding
of
an
unlawful
assembly
and
you're
charging
him
with
interruption
of
a
lawful
assembly
of
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
statute
say
that
the
interruption
has
to
be
against
the
consent
of
the
assembly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
statute
say
that
the
interruption
has
to
be
against
--
get
over
the
objection
of
the
assembly
itself?
suppose
that
it's
an
assembly
of
people
gathered
together
and
they
want
the
man
to
interrupt
and
make
a
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact
--
in
fact,
i
was
asking
though
when
--
what
part
of
your
statute
adds
to
these
words,
interruption
of
any
lawful
assembly
of
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
is
on
the
such
as
--
would
foresee
them
and
disturb
or
alarm
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
that
over
the
consent
of
the
assembly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
you
have
here
is
yes,
when
i
think,
you
have
something
very
much
like
it.
if
a
man
--
you
--
you've
made
it
a
crime,
a
man
to
go
in
to
an
assembly
and
if
you
say
interrupt
them
as
i
see
exactly
what
you
mean
by
it,
if
that
might
disturb,
foreseeably
disturb
or
alarm
somebody,
that's
your
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
unlawfully
to
--
and
over
the
consent
of
an
assembly
or
group
to
interfere
with
their
meetings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
one
drawn?
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
--
on
--
in
all
of
these
broad
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
that
it
if
could
be
sustained,
you'd
have
to
have
enough
evidence
and
they
didn't
separate
that,
basis
of
admission
and
has
to
be
showing,
wouldn't
it,
that
there
was
another
evidence
to
convict
on
all
of
them?
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
it.
do
i
understand
you
to
say,
you
charged
a
man
with
ten
different
offenses
and
an
information
that
he's
convicted
generally
that
the
court
would
then
have
a
right
to
sustain
it
without
showing
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
convict
on
all
the
ten
offenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
if
they're
separate
offenses,
might
you
not
then
be
subjecting
a
man
to
punishment
when
he
has
been
convicted
of
one
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
was
asking
you
because
i'm
--
i've
been
trying
to
think
maybe
you
didn't
understand
my
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
can't
--
i
can't
believe
that
let's
take
that
charge
ten
offenses
in
one
count.
let's
conceive
that
all
nine
of
them
could've
been
convicted
and
that
they
were
to
turn
the
blues.
so
on
the
10th,
it's
the
bad
charge
and
you
couldn't
convict
him
because
of
invalid
law.
would
you
--
are
you
still
saying
that
they
could
sustain
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
didn't
think
you
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
that
the
main
charges
--
offenses
made
here,
i
do
not
understand
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
maybe
had,
has
attempted
to
defend
the
conduct
what
you
have
charged
him
here.
maybe
he
did
but
i
didn't
hear
that,
that
he's
defending
a
charge
and
the
man
would
go
to
a
public
school
and
either
himself
drag
out
or
ask
others
to
drag
people
out
of
the
school
and
that
the
state
with
--
without
power
to
protect
itself
against
such
conduct
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
understand
that
these
are
the
procedural
matters
that
your
charges
in
the
first
place
are
too
vague
in
your
statute.
second
place
that
one
of
them
is
bad
and
that
you've
got
two
charges
with
one
offense
and
he
can't
tell
that
you
convict
him
on
the
right
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that,
as
i
understand
it,
the
issue
that's
put
up
to
us,
is
not
to
approve
as
constitutionally
protected
conduct
which
is
charged
here
in
this
case
but
that
you
can't
tell
whether
that's
what
is
convicted
for.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
it's
a
procedural
matter
with
reference
to
the
type
of
charges
that
you've
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
general
statute
against
trespassing
in
your
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
statue
anymore
definite
than
this?
what
about
religious
worship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
same
thing
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
stated
to
the
counsel
for
the
state
that
i
did
not
understand
you
to
argue
to
us
that
the
state
was
without
power
to
protect
its
school
from
having
people
come
in,
who
are
not
students
and
go
through
the
classrooms
or
interrupt
the
meetings
or
advice
others
to
do
so,
am
i
correct
in
that
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
shotgun
nature
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
understand
of
course,
the
difference
between
the
collins
statute,
the
ordinates,
in
which
he's
convicted,
where
he's
speakingly,
he
had
a
right
to
leave
where
the
charges
here
that
he
came
to
a
place
that
was
unlawful,
it
seemed
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
on
the
constitutional
level,
collins
case
related
the
speeches
made
where
a
man
had
a
right
to
be
and
the
state
couldn't
stop
him
from
making
those
speeches,
but
assuming
that
this
is
a
school
where
dedicated
to
the
purpose
of
educating
children,
not
to
having
speeches
made
during
school
hours,
you
would
see
the
difference,
would
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you're
saying
is
the
fact
that's
layered
upon
to
cover
the
situation.
