the
allegation
in
fact
very
sufficient,

you
cannot
tell
from
this
record
whether
the
--
this
man
was
convicted
under
section
6,
assuming
that
section
6
conviction
would
stand
for
a
moment
or
section
7.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
that
as
being
consistent
in
neither
with
the
conviction
under
subsection
7
or
a
conviction
under
section
6?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
reference
to
justice
black's
question
to
your
opponent?
assuming
this
record
is
read
as
indicating
that
the
trial
judge
intended
to
basic
conviction
on
section
6
as
well
as
section
7,
with
the
concurrent
sentence
invoked,
what
would
your
position
be
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
one
count
that
--
that
could
be
a
valid
count
and
there's
evidence
to
support
that
count
namely
section
6
by
hypothesis
for
a
moment.
and
he
finds
him
guilty
on
that
one
episode
and
then
guilty
on
the
other
episodes
which
are
maybe
vulnerable
and
he
poses
the
concurrent
sentence
and
the
concurrent
sentence
is
no
greater
than
that
which
would've
--
could've
been
imposed
on
the
valid
section
6
conviction.
