mr.
ralph
l.
roy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
louisiana
law
article
227
provides
in
effect
that
a
bill
of
information
shall
contain
the
essential
facts
or
averments
of
the
offense
charged.
that
same
act
provides
that
it
is
not
necessary
nor
required
that
the
identical
words
of
the
statute
involved,
be
set
forth
in
the
bill
of
information.
under
253
of
our
criminal
code
or
procedure,
an
accused
may,
if
he
so
desires,
apply
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
of
course,
i
recognize
the
fact
that
a
bill
of
particulars
will
not
hear
a
--
any
otherwise
stable
information.
i
meantion
the
bill
of
particular
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
understand
the
authority
of
this
court
in
criminal
state
cases
on
review
to
be
limited
to
federal
or
constitutional
questions
if
you
will,
which
have
been
presented
to
you
and
passed
upon
by
the
trial
court,
by
the
state
district
court
and
by
the
state
high
court.
this
particular
section
or
sections
that
petitioner
alleges
he
was
or
was
not
charged
with,
was
information
that
he
could
have
obtained,
had
he
asked
for
it,
however,
he
would
have
not
been
entitled
to
it.
i'm
sure
the
trial
judge
would've
given
it
to
him.
i
think
as
to
which
section
this
--
or
sections
this
bill
of
information
covers,
i
think
this
question
can
readily
be
ascertained
by
merely
reading
the
bill
of
information
in
view
of
and
in
the
light
of
the
law
allegedly
violated
103.
and
it
is
true
103
has
several
sections,
seven
sections
to
be
exact
and
they
are,
disjunctively
set
forth
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
he
did,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
he
did
ask
for
it
but
the
information
that
he
sought
was
information
with
reference
to
the
witnesses
who
were
involved
in
our
case.
he
wanted
to
know
in
effect
who
the
witnesses
were,
who
allegedly
encouraged
to
enter
these
classroom
buildings
and
their
names,
etcetera.
he
did
not
ask
for
any
information
that
he
complains
of
here
today.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
at
page
--
application
--
page
14.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
you
will
note
in
--
generally
in
article
1,
he
wants
to
know
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
students
of
southern
university
that
the
accused
allegedly
encouraged
the
whole
unruly
and
non-authorized
demonstrations,
the
names,
addresses
of
students,
etcetera,
names
and
addresses,
name
and
addresses.
he
does
not
ask
which
section
was
being
charged
on
him.
therefore,
that
question
was
not
presented
to
the
district
court.
the
trial
court
was
not
presented
nor
reviewed
by
the
state
supreme
court
on
writ
of
certiorari.
and
therefore,
was
not
passed
upon
our
lower
courts.
as
i've
said,
the
reading
of
the
bill
of
information
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
question
as
to
what
section
he
was
charged
on,
or
sections.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
he
--
he
filed
motions
to
quash.
it
was
generally
--
in
general
language
urged
the
unconstitutionality
of
--
of
the
proceedings
on
based
on
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
he
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
would
not
think,
your
honor.
on
our
law
as
this
court
undoubtedly
knows,
in
criminal
cases,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
limited
to
questions
of
fact,
of
--
of
law
rather.
the
court
--
the
state
supreme
court
does
not
pass
some
questions
of
--
of
--
of
fact
or
evidence.
in
order
to
properly
present
a
question
of
law
to
the
state
supreme
court,
it
is
necessary
that
in
the
trial
court,
what
we
call
a
bill
of
exceptions
must
be
perfected,
must
be
taken
and
perfected.
now,
this
is
done
for
example
if
a
witness
is
being
--
is
testifying
and
accused,
he
wants
to
object
to
a
question,
he
makes
his
objection
at
the
time.
he
states
his
specific
reasons
upon
which
the
objection
is
based.
the
ruling
of
the
court
has
made
a
part
of
this
bill
of
exception
and
the
acceptor
makes
the
testimony
of
the
--
the
witness
or
any
other
evidence
that
he
wishes
to
make
a
part
of
this
so
called
bill
of
exception,
which
is
signed
by
the
judge
and
a
per
curiam
written,
the
connection
that
we
--
the
explanation
therefore
and
this
constitutes
what
is
known
as
a
bill
of
exception
and
this
is
the
only
thing
that
constitutes
the
record
in
a
criminal
case
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
transcript
of
the
witnesses,
the
--
the
evidence
in
the
case,
on
a
criminal
case,
is
not
subject
to
review
by
the
state
supreme
court
unless
that
transcript
of
evidence
is
specifically
attached
to
and
made
a
part
of
a
bill
of
exceptions,
which
incidentally,
was
not
done
in
this
case.
the
trial
judge
points
this
out
in
all
of
his
per
curiams.
therefore,
when
--
when
applicant
--
when
petitioner
filed
his
applications
for
writs
to
the
state
supreme
court,
i
would
think,
following
the
law
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
no
record
other
than
the
bill
of
informations
and
the
minutes
of
the
court
would
have
no
transcript
or
testimony.
getting
back
to
the
affirmance
in
this
case,
generally
speaking,
i
submit
that
the
accused
is
charged
with
the
violations
specifically,
clearly
of
6,
interruption
of
any
law
--
lawful
assembly
of
people.
it
is
true
as
contented
by
petitioner
that
the
word,
interruption
is
not
used
in
the
bill
of
information
but
as
--
as
stated
on
the
article
227,
it
is
not
necessary
to
categorically
and
literally
file
the
wording
or
the
words
of
the
offense
allegedly
violated.
we
submit
that,
and
i
quote,
"unlawfully
did
violate
ls
--
louisiana
revised
statutes
14:103
and
that
he
not
a
student
of
southern
university,
did
enter
upon
the
premises
of
southern
university
and
that
engaged
in
and
encouraged
students
of
southern
university
to
hold
unruly,
unauthorized
demonstration
on
the
campus
and
did
lead
and
encouraged
their
students
to
march
through
the
university
buildings
were
our
classes
were
being
conducted
and
did
encourage
etcetera.
now,
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'm
reading
from
the
bill
of
information,
your
honor
and
i
say,
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
page
4
and
i
say
it
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'm
sorry,
i
was
reading
from
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'm
reading
from
--
from
petitioners
brief
on
page
4.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
as
page
1.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
so
they
plead
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
this
is
number
one.
if
i
might
explain
a
little
later
your
honor,
what
i
was
saying
was
that
the
wording
did
lead
and
encouraged
such
students
to
march
through
the
university
buildings
is
a
descriptive
factual
averment
of
an
interruption.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they
were
made
as
part
of
a
bill
of
exception
by
--
by
a
counsel
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
the
petitioner.
no
sir,
they're
a
separate
bill.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
they
were
filed
and
they
are
pending.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
we
say
that
the
factual
averment
did
lead
and
encouraged
such
students
to
march
through
the
university
buildings
while
classes
were
being
conducted.
we
say
this
is
a
factual
averment
of
the
interruption
of
a
lawful
assembly,
which
are
the
ultimate
of
facts
that
the
trial
court
must
determine.
as
also
contained
in
this
bill
of
information,
as
was
noted
by
counsel
and
--
and
i
quote
further,
"and
did
encourage
such
students
to
boycott
and
leave
the
classes
in
such
manner
as
would
foreseeably
disturbed
and
alarmed
the
public.
well
of
course,
the
state
is
not
--
is
not
contending
here
that
it
is
against
the
law
to
urge
a
boycott.
as
we
have
said
that
reasonably,
there
were
several
bills
of
information
filed
in
this
case
and
subsequently,
one
bill
of
information
was
filed
which
is
the
one
we
are
concerned
with
here
today.
the
bill
of
information
which
was
filed
and
upon
which
this
accused
petitioner
was
tried,
contains
a
combination
of
two
subparagraphs
of
subsections
if
you
will,
of
this
103.
it
contains
five
holding
of
an
unlawful
assembly
and
it
contains
six
interruption
of
any
lawful
assembly
of
people.
now,
in
our
law
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i'm
saying
that,
although
we
have
averted
--
averred
that
statement
in
the
bill
of
information
that
we
are
not
--
we
did
not
aver
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
averred
it
on
the
question
of
intent.
now,
disturbing
the
peace
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
perhaps
if
i'll
start
from
here.
disturbing
the
peace
is
the
doing
of
any
of
the
following
in
such
a
man
etcetera.
in
order
to
violate
this
offense,
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
voluntarily
and
willfully
done,
intentionally
done.
for
example
engaging
in
a
fistic
encounter,
a
--
a
person
who
would
be
assailed,
may
use
force
to
protect
himself
against
his
assailant.
in
such
an
encounter,
that
particular
person
would
not
be
guilty
of
disturbing
the
peace
by
engaging
in
the
fistic
encounter
because
it
has
to
be
a
willful,
intentional
thing.
now,
sets
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
what
i'm
saying
is,
your
honor,
under
--
under
section
222,
by
our
criminal
court
procedure,
that
is
a
proviso
and
i
quote,
"several
distinct
offenses
are
the
--
are
the
intent
necessary
to
constitute
such
offenses
disjunctively
enumerated
in
the
same
law
or
in
the
same
section
of
a
criminal
statute
may
be
accumulated
in
the
same
count
when
it
appears
that
they
are
connected
with
the
same
transaction
and
constitute
but
one
act,
but
in
that
event,
they
must
be
charged
conjunctively."
now,
this
is
the
authority
whereby
we
filed
the
bill
of
information
which
we
are
presently
concerned
with.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
you
will
note
and
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honor,
on
--
on
page
9
of
brief
for
respondent,
this
particular
--
this
particular
section
is
set
forth
and
you
will
note
the
words
or
the
intent
necessary
to
constitute
such
offense.
this
is
where
the
averment
in
the
bill
of
information
with
reference
to
boycotting
comes
in.
it
was
set
forth
as
an
averment
to
show
that
this
--
to
buy
up
on
the
question
of
the
intent
of
this
accused
to
commit
the
offense
of
that
is
left
violated.
the
fact
that
he
--
he
was
preaching
boycotting,
he
didn't'
want
the
members
to
go
to
class.
it's
not
against
the
laws
of
criminal
violation
but
it
does
have
some
prohibitive
vie
on
the
question
of
whether
he
voluntarily
did
that
or
expected
them
to
do
what
we
say
he
did
when
he
said,
go
out
and
pull
them
out
of
the
classroom.
so
in
that
respect,
it
is
averred
as
being
of
some
prohibitive
weight
on
the
question
of
intent.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
5
or
6,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
we
have
5
and
6
and
then
we
have
the
averment
which
is
made
for
the
purposes
of
the
intent.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
now
if
i
may
proceed
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
might
be
able
to
connect
it.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
here,
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
beg
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well
then
we
wouldn't
have
--
we
wouldn't
have
any
problem
your
honor,
at
all.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
the
first
part
disturbing
the
peace
is
the
doing
of
any
of
the
following
in
such
manner
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir
and
--
and
i
might
say
that
foreseeability
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
foreseeability
has
been
or
is
identified,
defined
according
to
our
law
section
24
rather
section
2
of
our
criminal
code
and
i
quote,
"foreseeability
refers
to
that
which
ordinarily
would
be
anticipated
by
a
human
being
of
average
reasonable
intelligence
and
perception."
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i
know
--
i
know
of
no
other.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it's
--
it's
been
--
i
would
know
to
the
day
but
it's
been
quite
--
it's
been
on
the
books
for
quite
--
quite
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir,
quite
a
few
years.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
the
--
the
trial
court
in
--
in
all
of
these
per
curiam
exceptions
make
mention
to
it.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
didn't
--
well,
it's
--
it's
in
the
brief
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
in
our
criminal
code,
section
24
as
most
states
do,
i
imagine,
under
the
category
of
parties.
we
have
this
article
and
i
quote,
"all
persons
concerned
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
where
the
present
or
absent
and
whether
they
directly
commit
their
act
to
constitute
in
the
offense,
aid
and
abet
in
this
commission
or
directly
or
indirectly
counsel
or
procure
another
to
commit
the
crime
or
principles."
in
other
words,
this
is
the
codification
of
what
was
an
accessory
before
the
fact
that
common
law
makes
an
extra
--
type
of
party
a
principle
on
our
law.
and
it
is
under
this
crime
which
is
applicable
to
all
of
the
basic
offenses
murder,
rape,
robbery,
disturbing
the
peace,
if
you
will,
because
this
article
in
effect
says,
"any
person
who
is
concerned
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
whether
he
is
directly
present
or
not,
who
aids
or
abet
all
who
procures
or
counsels
directly
or
indirectly
another
to
commit
a
crime,
is
the
principle."
and
it
is
upon
this
particular
law
in
connection
with
what
the
evidence
showed
some
100
students
to
do
that
is
go
through
these
classrooms
and
completely
interrupt
them,
immediately
after
this
petitioner
had
urged
them
to
do
so,
it
is
upon
that
evidence
that
the
state
contends
for
his
conviction.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
the
--
the
nearest
answer
that
i
can
give
for
that
argument
is
it
contained
in
his
own
brief.
in
a
footnote
at
page
11
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
the
trial
judge
in
one
of
his
per
curiam
bill
of
exceptions
number
7,
this
--
this
was
at
a
--at
a
point
when
the
state
had
rested
in
chief
and
counsel
for
defendant,
for
petitioner
herein,
made
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
based
upon
the
inadequacy
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
presented
by
the
state,
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
--
this
being
a
misdemeanor
case,
being
triable
without
a
jury.
here's
what
the
judge
said,
"the
court
overrules
the
motion
for
the
reason
that
the
state
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
had
sustained
its
burden
approving
the
guilt
into
defendant
beyond
reasonable
doubt."
reliable
confident
evidence
offered
by
the
state
show
that
the
defendant,
a
non-student
was
present
on
the
campus
of
southern
university
on
the
dates
alleged
in
the
bill
of
information
and
while
that
did
in
speeches
made
by
him,
in
meetings
not
authorized
by
those
in
charge
of
these
matters,
encourage
and
exhort
southern
university
students
to
boycott
classes
and
to
march
into
the
classroom
while
classes
were
in
session
and
to
disrupt
the
classes
even
to
the
extent
of
pulling
the
students
from
the
classrooms
in
such
a
manner
as
would
--
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public.
now,
on
our
law,
the
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
read
that
as
being
a
conviction
on
the
subsection
6
and
7
--
i
mean
5
and
6.
as
i
said,
the
averment
with
reference
to
urging
the
students
to
boycott
classes
is
an
averment
that
was
placed
in
the
bill
of
information
in
order
to
show
the
intent
involved
or
the
willingness
involved
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
this
case.
now,
actually
when
--
when
an
accused
person
commits
several
crimes
in
one
transaction,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
two
means
by
which
it
may
proceed.
it
may
separately
by
separate
bill
of
information
or
indictment,
charge
his
violation,
as
it
initially
did
in
this
case
against
petitioner.
or
it
makes
in
one
count,
accumulates
conjunctively
all
of
these
alleged
violations
and
only
penalty
involved
is
one
conviction.
so
actually,
it
--
it
--
it
really
works
in
favor
of
an
--
of
an
accused
person.
he's
subjected
to
one
trial,
one
penalty.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
exactly
what
the
judge
said
in
--
in
--
in
his
motion
for
directed
verdict.
our
louisiana
law
has
no
provision
whereby
a
judge
or
a
jury.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
your
honors
have
--have
said
on
numerous
occasions
and
you
did
it
recently
in
the
--
in
the
garner
case
that
you
can
make
an
independent
search
of
the
record
and
if
it
is
devoid
of
any
evidentiary
nature
or
foundation,
why
--
you
--
you
can
reverse
and
--
and
you've
done
it.
now,
if
you
look
at
this
record
and
with
reference
to
the
specific
charges
and
you
find
that
the
record
is
not
devoid
with
reference
to
an
interruption
of
a
lawful
assembly
and
you
find
that
the
reference
that
the
record
is
not
devoid
of
evidential
foundation
of
--
unauthorized
assembly
and
you
find
a
record
not
to
be
devoid
evidentiary
wise
in
any
particular
phase
of
this
case,
well
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
anything
but
affirm.
in
--
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
in
order
for
the
higher
court
to
overrule
a
criminal
court
--
a
criminal
case,
not
only
must
error
be
shown
but
prejudicial
error
must
be
shown.
and
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
difference.
we
have
errors
all
the
time.
i
dare
say
that
you
can
pick
up
this
record
and
find
plenty
errors,
counsel
pointed
one
of
mouth.
he
says,
the
trial
judge
was
talking
as
if
he
was
--
he
was
--
he
was
thinking
under
the
provisions
of
number
7
and
as
he
said
that,
i
found
some
--
some
language
used
by
the
trial
judge
early
in
the
case,
in
some
informal
conversation
between
the
trial
judge
and
--
and
one
of
counsel
for
petitioner.
at
page
35
whereby
he
says
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
trial
judge
said,
"the
accused
is
being
tried
for
disturbing
the
peace
by
urging
them
to
do
an
unlawful
claim,
break
up
the
classes."
so,
direct
is
not
perfect
but
i
submit
that
just
because
the
judge
may
have
made
an
error
on
some
incidental
question
during
the
proceedings
that
this
should
not
warrant
this
court
in
--
in
giving
the
reversal
and
i'm
sure
it
would.
i
like
to
say
one
other
thing,
counsel
is
relying
plenty
on
freedom
of
speech,
vague
and
general
academia
involved
etcetera.
now,
this
court,
of
course,
has
recognized
it
--
although
freedom
of
speech
is
important
that
it
is
not
an
absolute
thing
and
it
is
subject
to
limitation
and
restriction.
this
court
has
held
that
slanderous
statements
do
not
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
first
and
fourteenth.
statements
that
incite
to
immediate
right
or
--
or
statements
that
this
court
has
called
fighting
words
do
not
enjoy
the
shield
of
protection
of
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
say
likewise,
that
the
language
by
our
petitioner
to
the
effect,
let's
go
into
the
classes
and
pull
them
out
if
necessary.
i
say
this
is
not
language
that
has
any
probative
social
intercourse.
this
is
not
language
that
this
court
should
be
interested
in
protecting.
this
is
--
this
is
language
that
--
that
calls
us
disorder
and
disruption
in
society.
and
certainly,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
--
in
maintaining
good
order
in
society.
i
might
say
one
more
thing
before
i
close
and
it
simply
this.
as
was
indicated
earlier,
this
is
an
all-negro
university,
staffed
by
an
all-negro
faculty
and
administered
and
run
by
all-negro
personnel.
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
dean
harvey,
said
with
reference
to
this
last
speech
made
by
diamond,
he
asked,
"what
do
you
think
about
--
what
do
you
think
about
this
dean?"
dean
says,
"i
agree
with
him
100%,
on
his
talk
about
freedom
and
of
good
citizenship."
but
he
said,
"i
didn't
agree
with
the
way
he
wanted
to
do
it."
and
as
soon
dion
diamond
said
this,
"let's
go
out
into
classrooms
and
get
them,"
one
of
the
security
officers
immediately
and
this
in
the
record,
ran
to
the
--
to
get
some
of
his
men
so
he
can
station
them
out
around
the
classrooms,
that
were
--
around
the
buildings
that
housed
the
classrooms.
and
immediately
thereafter,
counsel
said
about
an
hour,
somebody
in
the
records
said,
about
half
an
hour.
immediately
that
after
these
students,
some
100
carrying
these
signs
and
the
signs
at
page
34,
carrying
these
signs
through
classrooms,
stomping
their
feet
and
i
say
that
the
record
shows
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
complete
disruption
and
interruption
of
a
lawful
assembly.
that
they
--
they
were
violating
their
way
in
trenching
upon
the
rights
of
these
students,
who
also
have
rights.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
sir.
that's
all
i
have
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
however,
there
are
all
qualifications
to
--
to
the
applicability
of
this
particular
section.
the
offenses
must
be
connected
in
one
continuous
transaction.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
sir,
i
wanted
say
that
also
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
i
didn't
cover
that
but
for
example,
this
accused
could
not
regardless
to
the
outcome
of
this
case,
we
could
not
file
this
accuse
on
his
separate
bills.
he
could
plead
double
jeopardy
but
he
has
been
exposed
in
--
in
these
counts,
in
--
in
these
violations.
in
this
one
count,
he
has
been
exposed
to
do
these
things
and
whatever
he's
been
exposed
to,
whether
he's
convicted
or
acquitted,
he
will
--
he
will
enjoy
the
right
if
and
when
an
attempt
is
ever
made
to
prosecute
them
again
on
the
same
claim.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
i
understood
it.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that,
i
believe
what
you
--
that
could
be
sustained.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
--
if
they're
two
--
two
factual
averments
constituting
the
offense
--
and
it's
really
just
one
offense
here
but
it's
--
it's
charged
in
two
different
ways
in
the
same
account
--
count.
now,
if
the
evidence
would
support
one
and
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
on
the
other,
then
i
say
that
under
louisiana
law
that
the
trial
judge
can
find
him
guilty
of
the
offense
charged.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
his
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well
i
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
he's
relying
on
--
on
--
on
both
of
those
contentions.
he
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i
--
they
--
they
don't
prescribe
against
school.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
we
--
we
rely
to
disturbing
the
peace.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
thank
you.
