mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
brought
by
the
petitioner,
dion
diamond,
who
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
disturbing
the
peace
in
violation
of
louisiana
revised
statute
14:103
and
was
sentenced
to
jail
and
to
pay
a
fine.
petitioner
contends
generally
and
has
throughout
the
proceedings
that
his
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
his
conviction
for
making
a
series
of
speeches
under
a
vague
and
indefinite
criminal
law.
now,
the
statute
involved
is
setout
on
the
second
page
of
petitioner's
brief,
it
is
that
may
be
remembered
as
the
law
which
was
before
this
court
in
garner
against
louisiana
two
years
or
three
years
ago.
the
part
a
of
the
statute
with
--
which
we're
concerned,
contains
seven
subsections
prohibiting
a
number
of
different
acts.
the
--
for
example,
the
first
describes
as
engaging
--
as
disturbing
the
peace,
engaging
in
a
fistic
encounter,
the
second
relates
to
unnecessary
--
unnecessarily
loud,
offensive
or
insulting
language.
the
third,
appearing
in
an
intoxicated
condition,
the
fourth,
engaging
in
any
act
in
a
violent
and
tumultuous
manner.
and
now
we
come
to
the
last
three
sections.
section
5,
holding
of
an
unlawful
assembly,
6,
interruption
of
any
lawful
assembly
of
people
and
7,
relate
--
the
catch
or
clause
relates
to
the
commission
of
any
other
act
in
such
a
manner
as
to
unreasonably
disturb
or
alarm
the
public.
now,
the
parties
are
in
dispute
in
this
case
as
to
which
part
of
this
law
was
used
to
convict
the
petitioner
and
indeed,
the
state
has
shifted
its
ground
in
successive
briefs
filed
in
this
court.
the
state
now
contends
that
subsections
5
and
6
were
the
ones
used
to
convict
the
petitioner.
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari,
they
argued
only
that
subsection
6
was
in
the
law.
now
before
--
but
--
but
before
describing
the
facts
in
the
proceedings,
i'd
like
to
briefly
state
just
--
just
state
without
argument,
the
principal
arguments
that
we
will
make.
first,
we
contend
that
this
case
is
like
stromberg
against
california.
and
that,
there
is
no
way
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
trial
judge
relied
upon
the
most
sweeping
and
general
and
indefinite
part
of
the
statute,
subsection
7
to
convict
the
petition
and
that
this
provision
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
and
secondly,
we
urge
that
in
another
aspect,
for
cases
like
thomas
against
collins
because
whatever
part
of
the
law,
it
was
used
to
convict
diamond,
he
was
convicted
and
given
a
single
penalty
for
making
a
number
of
speeches
and
saying
a
number
of
different
things
including
the
charge
that
he
encouraged
a
group
of
college
students
to
stay
away
from
classes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
they
took
--
finished
that
second
thought.
there
--
no
part
of
the
statute
is
sufficiently
precise
and
definite
to
punish
this
type
of
--
this
particular
type
of
speech.
and
the
applical
--
applicable
principle
of
thomas
against
collins
being
that
as
for
a
single
conviction
rest
on
more
than
one
state
and
one
of
the
statesmen
cannot
validly
be
punished
here
for
want
a
fair
warning.
the
entire
conviction
must
be
reversed.
now,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
one
of
them
did,
your
honor,
one
of
the
speeches
for
which
he
was
convicted.
i'm
going
to
attempt
right
now
to
describe
the
--
the
evidence
which
concerned
a
series
of
speeches
made
by
diamond
on
the
campus
of
southern
university
near
--
in
east
baton
rouge
parish,
louisiana.
the
time
of
his
first
speech,
which
was
on
january
20th
or
30th
of
1962,
some
of
the
southern
university
students
had
been
engaged
on
a
boycott
of
classes
for
several
days
and
their
protest
related
to
the
school's
treatment
of
some
students
who
had
been
arrested
in
anti-segregation
demonstration.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
it
is
your
honor,
the
school
established
in
the
state
constitution
and
the
statutes
provide
for
its
administration
by
state
department
of
education.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
has
been
and
is
still
operated
only
for
negroes.
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
--
in
the
state
constitution
or
--
or
the
statute
which
specifically
limits
it
to
negroes.
however,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
well
--
well,
on
the
morning
of
january
30th
when
diamond
came
on
to
make
his
first
speech,
he
was
not
a
student
in
that
university,
when
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
he
had
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
he's
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
record
does
not
indicate
how
--
how
or
why
he
--
he
came
on
the
--
on
the
campus.
on
this
--
on
this
morning,
diamond
was
seen
at
about
9:30
in
the
morning
by
the
dean
of
students,
speaking
to
a
group
of
students
in
a
quadrangle
outdoors
in
the
campus.
the
dean
listened
to
diamond's
speech
for
10
or
15
minutes
and
his
testimony
is
the
only
description
of
this
first
speech.
he
--
he
said
only
that
diamond
was
talking
about
the
importance
of
demonstrating
and
staying
out
quest,
it's
a
quote,
that's
the
only
description
of
the
first
speech
on
the
morning
of
the
30th.
the
meeting
lasted
--
the
speech
lasted
about
15
minutes
and
the
students
then
dispersed
on
about
their
business.
the
second
speech
occurred
the
next
morning
on
the
31st,
i
might
interject
at
this
point
that
the
information
charges
that
diamond
committed
this
crime
on
the
two
days.
on
the
second
morning,
and
again
about
the
same
time
and
place,
diamond
was
again
seen
by
the
dean,
speaking
to
a
group
of
several
hundred
students
on
the
campus.
and
he's
--
and
the
dean's
only
description
of
the
second
speech
was
that
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
previous
day.
the
speech
was
also
heard
by
a
man
named,
(inaudible),
it
was
the
campus
guard
or
security
guard.
and
he
--
he
said
that
diamond
told
the
students
listening
to
him
not
to
go
classes.
the
faculty
had
signed
some
sort
of
a
petition
to
supporting
them
and
that
they
should
show
their
gratitude
by
staying
out
of
classes
during
this
dispute.
again,
the
meeting
lasted
about
15
to
20
minutes,
that's
all
it
had.
now,
the
dean
said
that
he
didn't
authorize
diamond
to
make
these
speeches.
and
for
listening
to
him
for
15
to
20
minutes,
he
started
toward
him
to
tell
him,
he
didn't
have
permission,
but
then
the
meeting
broke
up
so
he
never
talked.
now,
the
third
speech
occurred
during
the
noon
hour
of
the
second
day.
and
the
estimates
of
the
number
of
students
listening
--
there
varied
from
200
to
600
and
three
witnesses
testified
about
this
third
speech.
again,
with
respect
to
the
third
speech,
the
dean
who
heard
it
said
it
--
"it
concerned
principally
the
boycotting
of
classes."
that's
the
only
description
of
it.
however,
the
two
campus
security
guards
gave
and
said
more.
they
said
that
--
officer
(inaudible)
that
he
heard
diamond
tell
the
students,
we
will
go
through
the
classrooms
and
if
necessary,
we
will
put
them
out
of
their
classrooms.
and
his
assistant
harris
said
he
heard
diamond
urging
the
students
to
say
--
stay
out
of
classes
and
to
say,
"let's
go
through
the
classrooms
and
to
go
from
classroom
to
classroom."
now
this
speech
ended
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
these
are
the
--
the
only
--
only
descriptions
of
this
third
speech
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
were
--
there
were
two
people
who
described
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
harris,
the
second
one
said
that
diamond
urged
the
students
and
a
--
diamond
was
pleading
for
more
followers
from
the
student
body.
that
he
urged
them
to
stay
out
of
classes
and
that
diamond
told
the
students
and
this
is
reported,
"let's
go
through
the
classrooms,"
and
also
at
another
place
to
go
from
classroom
to
classroom,
all
of
this
appears
between
pages
107
and
111
of
the
record.
but
those
are
the
only
reported
quotes.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
i
--
i've
--
i
had
read
that
just
a
moment
before,
that
was
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
was
the
first
witness
your
--
mr.
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
chief
justice
and
--
and
that
quote
was
at
page
63
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
we
will
go
through
the
classrooms
and
if
necessary,
we
will
put
them
out
of
the
classrooms.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
these
were
the
two
descriptions
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
of
the
speech.
now,
about
an
hour
after,
this
third
speech,
a
group
of
students
began
marching
around
the
campus
carrying
signs,
singing,
walking
through
the
classroom
buildings,
making
noise
and
in
general,
according
to
the
testimony,
disturbing
the
people
in
the
buildings
wherein
somebody's
classes
will
be
conducted.
this
lasted
for
at
least
over
a
half
an
hour.
there
was
no
testimony
that
anyone
was
actually
pulled
from
a
classroom.
there
were
no
fights
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
diamond
was
in
any
of
the
buildings
or
carrying
the
sign.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
was
no
--
well,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
the
first
question
and
what
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
was
it
about?
the
students
were
protesting
the
university's
treatment
of
some
--
of
some
students
who
had
previously
been
arrested
for
participating
in
anti-segregation
demonstrations.
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
in
baton
rouge
--
in
the
area,
somewhere.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
some
of
them
apparently
had
been
ousted
from
school.
that's
all
of
the
description
with
controversy
that
appears
in
this
record.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
four
signs
were
put
in
evidence.
they
were
not
specifically
identified
as
the
signs
carry
that
day
or
one
witness
said,
there
were
--
there
were
similar
to
the
signs.
i
can't
locate
that
description
out
of
the
--
at
the
moment.
it's
in
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
(inaudible).
in
any
event,
diamond
was
not
seen
participating
in
this
march
or
carrying
the
signs.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
made
the
sign
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
been
told
not
to
come
on
the
camp
or
so
not
to
make
a
speech
or
to
leave.
now,
about
6:00
that
evening,
there
was
an
official
meeting
of
the
student
government
organization
where
the
dean
spoke
and
the
president
of
the
student
body
spoke.
diamond
was
in
the
audience
and
he
asked
permission
to
speak,
when
permitted
to
and
he
left
without
causing
a
disturbance,
it's
uncontradicted.
and
later,
diamond
and
a
group
of
people
who
--
who
left
the
meeting,
several
people
made
impromptu
speeches
and
at
--
this
occasion
that
evening,
diamond
is
supposed
to
have
criticized
the
people
who
staged
this
march
through
the
classroom
early
in
the
day,
announced
them.
this
was
a
testimony
by
defense
witness
and
there
was
no
description
of
that
speech
by
the
prosecution
witnesses.
and
diamond
was
arrested
the
following
morning
when
he
arrived
on
the
campus
in
a
taxi
cab.
no
claim
that
he
did
anything
but
just
appear
the
following
morning.
now,
our
first
argument,
if
there
are
number
of
things
occurred
in
the
trial
which
make
it
impossible
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
trial
judge
relied
on
subsection
7
to
convict
diamond.
in
fact,
we
think
it's
very
probable
that
he
did.
the
first
of
this
was
the
circumstance
that
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
they
were
already
pending
against
diamond.
five
other
charges,
two
of
them
were
under
the
same
statute,
section
14:103
and
they
happened
to
--
to
appear
in
this
record.
there
were
tests
to
a
motion
to
quash
at
pages
10
and
12
of
the
charges
which
track
the
language
of
subsections
5
and
6.
they
charged
him
with
interrupting
a
lawful
assembly
and
with
prohibiting
and
--
and
withholding
an
unlawful
assembly.
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial,
this
trial,
the
prosecutor
sought
and
obtained
the
stipulation
that
when
this
other
cases
--
if
and
when
this
other
cases
were
brought
to
trial,
he
could
use
the
testimony
of
one
of
these
witnesses
in
these
future
trials.
beyond
this,
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
they
were
never
brought
to
trial
but
what
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
the
--
they
contained
no
detail
as
to
the
facts,
except
the
dates
which
were
from
january
29th
through
february
1st,
the
period
including
the
same
period
of
these
charges.
in
any
event,
the
prosecutor
at
the
beginning
of
this
trial
got
a
stipulation,
the
first
witness'
testimony
that
could
be
used
if
tried
these
--
both
these
other
cases
at
trial.
and
secondly
when
diamond
filed
a
motion
to
quash
in
which
he
asserted
that
section
--
that
the
whole
statute
was
vague,
the
trial
judge
ruled
and
specifically
ruled
on
the
--
that
subsection
7
was
valid
and
devoted
most
of
the
discussion
and
the
only
case
decided
pertained
to
--
to
this
catch
all
clause.
the
only
cases
cited
were
the
state
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
garner
case
and
two
companion
cases
and
an
earlier
case,
which
is
called
ponchatoula
versus
bates
which
had
upheld
a
generalized
disturbing
of
peace
--
prohibition,
so
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
this
appears
at
page
28
of
the
record
and
at
the
top
of
page
29
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
the
paragraph
is
starting
at
the
bottom
of
28.
all
it
is
said
is,
the
statute
sets
forth
six
different
specific
acts
disjunctively,
anyone
of
which
have
done
in
such
a
manner
as
perceivably
would
disturb
along
the
public,
constitutes
the
crime.
it's
the
only
reference
to
the
first
six
statutes.
and
any,
begins
to
talk
about
subsection
7
and
--
and
cite
the
--
and
cite
the
cases
which
he
believed
to
uphold
the
right
the
state
to
have
a
generalized
disturbing
of
peace
statute.
fairly,
when
--
when
diamond
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial,
in
which
he
made
explicit
what
he
assumed
throughout
that
he
was
charged
under
subsection
7.
the
court's
--
the
opinion
overruling
this
didn't
contradict
him
in
any
way.
it
just
said
that
the
statute
denouncing
the
crime
is
constitutional.
and
the
court
believed
there
was
--
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
in
the
--
similarly,
the
petitioner
urged
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
that
he
was
convicted
under
subsection
7,
but
that
court
affirmed
without
discussion.
it
was
only
until
we
get
to
this
court
and
when
the
state
filed
its
brief
in
our
position
to
certiorari
that
the
state
contends
that
diamond
was
charged
with
interrupting
a
lawful
assembly.
the
state
didn't
stick
to
that
very
long
because
just
a
few
months
later,
when
they
filed
a
brief
on
the
merits
here,
they
now
shifted
ground
in
our
arguing
that
diamond
was
convicted
of
holding
an
unlawful
assembly
and
interrupting
a
lawful
assembly.
so
that,
that
plus
an
examination
of
the
charge
against
diamond,
it
appears
on
the
first
page
of
the
record,
tends
to
confirm
that
section
--
subsection
7
may
have
been
involved.
that
the
information
alleges
is
a
--
a
variety
of
conduct
which
is
not
expressly
mentioned
in
the
statute.
it
--
it
includes
this
charge
of
encouraging
students
to
boycott
or
it
did
not
the
use
the
words
of
any
of
the
subsections,
did
not
track
the
language
of
any
of
the
seven
subsections.
and
we
submit
that
an
information
sufficiently
imprecise
to
permit
the
--
this
--
this
type
of
shifting
theory
as
to
what
the
charge
is
by
the
state
is
at
least
sufficiently
unclear
to
seem
to
invoke
this
general
and
sweeping
catch-all
clause,
subsection
7.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
under
section
6?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
--
and
--
and
this
relates
really
to
our
--
the
second
argument
that
if
a
charge
of
--
if
a
charge
that
students
--
that
--
that
it's
a
--
if
a
charge
of
encouraging
students
to
boycott
and
leave
classes
is
embraced
by
6,
then
we
would
submit
that
--
that
--
that
6
doesn't
give
any
fair
warning
if
that's
included.
let
--
let
me
explain
that
a
little.
the
--
part
of
the
charge
against
diamond,
quite
clearly
was
that
he
encouraged
students
to
boycott
classes,
he
was
not
convicted
simply
for
making
one
speech.
the
--
the
trial
judge
made
clear
that
diamond
was
convicted
for
making
a
series
of
speeches.
his
--
to
judges
some
of
the
evidence,
he
thought
sufficient
to
convict
refers
to
speeches
in
the
plural
and
then
--
and
this
appears
two
or
three
of
--
two
or
three
times
in
the
record.
now,
there
was
only
one
speech
which
related
to
the
march,
the
first
two
speeches
that
had
--
dealt
only
with
encouraging
students
to
stay
out
of
classes
so
that
if
--
if
it
seems
clear
that
--
the
part
of
the
affairs
which
diamond
was
convicted,
was
simply
urging
that
the
students
stay
away
from
classes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
both
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
just
like
thomas
against
collins
where
thomas
was
charged
with
making
one
--
one
speech
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
if
you
have
separate
adjudications
of
guilt
on
each
count
determination
that
--
that
--
that
would
be
different
from
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
--
because
the
--
the
determination
of
guilt
was
a
general
one.
the
determination
of
guilt
didn't
differentiate
between
the
--
the
two
charges
so
it's
not
possible
to
know.
in
other
words,
in
--
in
thomas
against
collins,
thomas
made
a
speech
in
which
he
urged
that
the
--
his
audience
generally
joined
the
union
and
that
specific
person
in
the
audience
joined
the
union
and
there
was
a
--
a
single
penalty
imposed
for
these
two
acts
and
this
court
held
that
where
one
of
them
could
not
constitutionally
be
punished,
the
whole
conviction
had
to
fall
and
it
had
to
be
sustained
as
to
both
or
as
to
neither.
it
was
in
light
--
as
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
now,
the
trial
judge
never
said
what
he
was
convicting
at.
he
said,
"diamond
is
guilty
as
charged
in
the
whole
statute."
it's
quite
--
they
never
say.
we
never
heard
anything
about
6
until
in
this
court.
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
there
were
--
there
were
--
there
were
five
charges
--
these
five,
we
refer
to
in
this
record
filed
before
this
one.
the
one
--
one
under
section
6,
one
under
section
5,
another
one
charging
vagrancy,
another
one
charging
--
that
were
all
summarized
in
a
footnote,
from
my
brief
i
think
and
perhaps
i'd
better
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
evidence
tends
to
confirm
my
theory
--
my
interpretation
of
this
--
of
the
information.
the
--
the
--
the
evidence
and
the
judge's
finding,
however,
the
judge
relied
on
more
than
one
speech
--
at
page
40
of
the
record.
he
refers
to
speeches,
the
--
now,
the
phrase
as
would
foreseeably
disturb
and
alarm
the
public,
which
appears
at
the
end
--
near
the
end
of
the
information.
this
is
the
prefatory
phrase
which
applies
that
all
sub
--
all
subsections
of
the
statute
and
presumably,
was
intended
in
the
information
to
--
to
apply
although
there's
no
punctuation
there,
to
all
of
the
three
acts
alleged
before
it
and
--
and
not
just
the
last
one
concerning
boycott.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
first
time
during
these
proceedings,
the
state
has
attempted
to
raise
on
the
procedural
objection
and
that
the
way
the
issues
were
raised.
so
i
would
submit
that
the
free
speech
and
vagueness
issues
were
properly
raised
the
right
way,
the
earliest
possible
time,
the
motion
is
quashed
before
the
trial.
they
were
ruled
on
adversely
to
the
petitioner's
contention.
they
were
reiterated
in
the
motion
for
new
trial
in
the
court
--
in
the
trial
court,
again
rejected
them
and
that
they
were
properly
before
the
state
supreme
court.
now,
counsel
made
some
sort
of
--
sort
of
an
argument
about
the
bill
of
exceptions
and
the
references
and
the
trial
judges'
opinions
to
irregularity,
in
the
way
the
petitioner
preserved
his
bill
of
exceptions.
first,
i
should
point
out
that
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
under
the
state
law
in
this
case
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
just
like
the
procedure
described
in
--
in
this
court's
opinion
in
--
in
garner
against
louisiana.
it
was
no
right
of
appeals
because
the
fine
and
the
jail
sentence
were
too
small.
the
only
way
petitioner
could
get
review
of
this
conviction
in
the
state
supreme
court,
was
pipelined
to
these
extraordinary
reefs
attempting
to
evoke
the
state
supreme
court's
supervisory
jurisdiction.
now,
louisiana
supreme
court
held
as
long
ago
as
1926
that
in
the
case
called
state
versus
mullen
at
160
louisiana
916
107
southern
698,
that
where
--
that
the
supervisory
jurisdiction
is
involved,
it
suffices
that
the
errors
complained
of
are
paid
into
on
the
face
of
the
record.
and
it
does
not
matter
at
all
that
in
that
case,
that
the
bill
of
particulars
weren't
even
signed
by
the
trial
judge.
so
the
ordinary
procedures
for
appeal
are
not
applicable
in
the
state
supreme
court
presumably
held
at.
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
any
of
the
state
court
rulings
that
it
was
not
ruling
on
the
federal
questions
presented,
though
the
trial
judge
noted
this
certain
mistakes
of
counseling
nevertheless,
when
he
had
ruled
on
the
merits.
now
in
addition,
the
--
the
discussion
of
a
bill
of
particulars,
we
submit
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
objection
is
not
--
made
by
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
way
they
make
the
objection
about
to
an
information
is
by
a
motion
to
quash
and
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
in
the
case
involving
its
very
statute
which
is
cited
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief
and
it's
called
state
against
morgan
in
which
also
mr.
justice
black,
gives
the
history
of
this
statute
and
whether
there
is
parts
that
it
came
from,
the
statue
or
part
(a)
of
in
any
event
was
passed
in
1942.
and
it
--
as
that
morgan
case
describes
was
an
attempt
to
gather
together
offenses
from
various
different
parts
of
the
code.
i
might
add
that
there
has
been
no
state
court
litigation
which
in
anyway
illuminates
any
of
this
subsections.
no
construction
of
what
interruption
of
a
lawful
assembly
of
people
means.
as
to
subsection
5,
holding
of
an
unlawful
assembly.
that
was
based
on
an
earlier
law
which
the
--
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
invalid
in
1932,
so
10
years
--
held
invalid
in
--
in
1932.
the
case
was
cited
in
the
state's
brief
on
opposition
to
certiorari.
it's
called
state
against
bula
(ph).
now,
the
several
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
i
think
the
conviction
would
have
to
be
reversed
because
it
would
seem
clear
to
me
that
no
part
of
the
statute
neither
6
nor
7
or
5,
no
part
of
the
statute
warns
against
one
of
the
acts
which
--
this
is
my
argument
based
on
thomas
against
collins.
no
further
statute
warrants
that
it's
criminal
to
make
a
speech
urging
a
boycott.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
subsection
6
might
be
thought
to
warn
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
that
--
but
--
but
it's
quite
clear
your
honor
that
the
trial
judge
relied
not
on
the
one
speech,
the
third
speech
--
the
trial
judge
talked
in
--
in
the
finding
that
mr.
roy
read
a
moment
ago
from
page
4
of
the
record.
the
trial
judge
talked
about
speeches.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
the
trial
judge
talked
about
the
fact
that
diamond
encouraged
the
boycott.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
not
my
confession.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
the
charge
--
if
the
charges
found
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh
well
--
well,
there
is
--
there
is
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
is
no
way
to
know
that
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
this
argument
would
not
at
all
cut
against
the
fact
that
--
that
the
trial
judge
might
have
found
him
guilty
for
an
act
which
neither
6
nor
7
warned.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
perfectly
playing
that
--
that
the
trial
judge
found
diamond
guilty
on
the
basis
of
a
--
a
number
of
speeches
mr.
justice
white,
which
--
which
only
one
which
involved
any
exhortation
to
march.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
but
--
but
the
single
penalty
rests
on
--
inevitably
on
by
--
by
that
--
that
statement
on
the
conviction
on
the
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
--
that
brings
on
another
problem
and
this
is
that
a
man
on
trial
accused
of
a
crime,
seems
to
me
has
a
right
to
know
to
some
notice
under
due
process
clause
what
the
charge
against
him
is.
and
how
can
diamond
know
what
the
charge
against
him
is,
if
two
years
later
the
district
attorney
who
drilled
the
information
is
still
shifting
from
one
part
of
the
statute
to
another.
even
--
he
asserted
positively
in
five
different
places
in
the
brief
and
our
position
to
certiorari
that
this
charge
was
based
on
6
and
no
other.
today,
the
argument
is
that
it's
based
on
5
and
6.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
--
i
assume
they
agree
with
that,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
the
--
the
trial
judge
himself,
said
on
--
on
in
this
opinion
on
--
appears
on
page
28,
that
he
considered
this
one
count.
so
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
your
--
your
statement
during
the
conflict
with
mr.
roy,
i
think,
accurately
described
my
position.
we'd
object
to
the
use
of
a
--
of
--
of
vague
and
general
statutes
which
--
in
applying,
we
have
the
speech
statutes
which
have
a
--
a
deterrent
effect
on
free
speech.
and
which
are
as
easily
like
the
--
well
known
language
in
thornhill
case.
these
are
statutes
which
could
just
as
easily
be
applied
to
other
types
of
speech
not
in
--
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
yes
your
honor
but
i
--
i
would
comment
upon
that,
that
nowhere
i
understand
--
i
do
understand
that
the
difference
and
i
think
my
--
my
argument
it
says,
to
reflect
it
look
your
remark
--
you
--
your
remark
indicates
that
there's
some
claim
that
diamond
had
no
right
to
be
here.
the
testimony
of
the
university
registrar
was
that
this
was
a
public
institution,
anyone
who
could
--
could
come
there
who
wanted.
nowhere
was
diamond
told
not
to
make
speeches
or
that
he
--
or
to
go
or
to
leave.
only
were
they
were
out
are
(voice

the
charges
against
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
indeed,
but
--
but
would
add
that
the
state
can't
draw
their
line
by
--
by
a
statute
which
unaddressed
itself
to
this
issue.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
precisely.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
might
very
well,
but
it
does
not
fairly
give
you
notice
that
it's
a
crime
to
make
this
a
series
of
speeches
and
(voice

--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
--
it
very
well
--
it
very
well
might
however
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
it
doesn't
have
to
draw
a
line.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
alright
if
you
--
if
you
had
a
different
charge
against
him,
a
different
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
information
against
him,
but
indicated
that
statute
and
you
have
different
evidence,
otherwise,
a
different
judgment.
the
trial
judge
didn't
rely
on
this
other
speech.
it
turned
to
be
--
it
seemed
to
me
be
a
different
case.
however,
i
--
i
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
but
wonder
whether
or
not,
a
statute
like
6
even
in
the
situation
you
oppose,
wouldn't
involve
a
fairly
substantial
vagueness
problem
because
it
doesn't
attempt
to
--
the
statute
doesn't
attempt
to
draw
any
line
between
constitutionally
protected
speech
and
unprotected
speech.
so
that
that
line
would
have
to
be
drawn
on
an
outmost
basis
but
the
trial
judge
after
you
--
you
heard
the
evidence
as
to
why
--
subsection
6
does
--
doesn't
represent
the
legislature's
attempt
to
draw
that
line.
but
--
but
--
but,
i
--
i
submit
that
our
entire
conversation
as
about
another
case
not
this
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
--
that
--
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
--
i
quite
agree,
i
--
i
--
i
attempted
to
indicate
my
agreement
with
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
would
be
different
also.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
in
--
indeed
mr.
justice
goldberg,
subsections
2
and
4
have
gone
unnoticed
but
by
imagine
--
with
the
