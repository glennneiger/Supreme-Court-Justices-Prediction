mr.
paschal
c.
reese
may
it
please
the
court.
this
time
i
would
like
to
request
that
mr.
james
t.
carlisle,
assistant
attorney
general,
state
of
florida
and
the
member
of
the
florida
court,
but
not
a
member
of
this
court
be
allowed
to
represent
the
honorable
james
w.
kynes,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
as
amicus
curiae
and
that
he
be
allowed
10
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
second
time
that
this
case
has
been
before
this
honorable
body
on
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit.
on
the
first
occasion,
the
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
questions
involved
had
not
been
answered
by
the
supreme
court,
by
--
and
state
in
the
state
of
florida
--
any
court
in
the
state
of
florida.
the
question
that
was
outlined
by
this
court
were
propounded
to
the
state
--
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
and
after
quite
an
argument
with
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
under
section
25.013
of
the
florida
statutes
19
and
at
that
time
it
was
57
of
florida
statutes
whether
or
not
the
court
had
constitutional
authority
to
answer
questions
propounded
by
federal
courts.
the
court
finally
held
that
it
did
have
such
constitutional
authority
and
thereafter
changed
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
rules,
the
appellate
courts
of
florida
rather,
so
that
it
could
accept
questions
propounded
by
federal
courts.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
then
answered
both
questions
propounded
to
it
in
the
affirmative.
it
said
in
effect
that
under
section
95.03
of
the
florida
statutes
now
19.63
that
state
of
florida
had
sufficient
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
since
mr.
clay
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
florida
and
all
of
his
property
was
located
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
had
been
so
located
since
about
one
month
after
this
contract
had
been
entered
to
in
illinois
and
that
further
more
the
loss
took
place
in
state
of
florida,
investigation
of
the
loss
was
made
by
the
insurance
company
within
the
state
of
florida
and
the
insurance
company
was
authorized
to
transact
business
in
state
of
florida.
at
this
personal
property
floater
policy
was
a
policy
that
guaranteed
against
loss
in
any
part
of
the
world,
it
was
termed
the
world
wide
policy,
and
that
therefore
the
paramount
interests
of
any
state
in
this
matter
was
with
the
state
of
florida.
the
matter
was
then
referred
of
course
back
to
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
again
basing
its
opinion
upon
home
insurance
company
versus
dick,
hartford
and
delta
pine
land
company
reiterated
the
opinion
that
it
had
previously
handed
down
whereas
in
the
first
opinion
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
believed
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
would
take
such
and
such
position.
when
the
state
of
florida,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
did
not
take
such
a
position,
then
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
since
the
supreme
court
of
florida
under
the
(inaudible)
arrangement
that
we
have
of
court
of
appeals
had
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
in
state
of
florida
did
not
call
questions
of
this
sort.
in
other
words,
it
should
have
been
according
to
the
as
i
read
the
opinion
the
question
should
have
been
propounded
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
district
courts
of
appeal.
now
it
so
happens
that
soon
after
the
supreme
court
handed
down
its
decision,
the
same
question
came
before
the
second,
the
district
court
of
appeals
to
the
second
district,
and
following
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
they
affirmed
that
decision.
i
cannot
--
in
every
case,
even
in
the
dick
case
and
in
delta
and
pine
land
case
and
most
particularly
in
the
watson
case,
which
is
the
latest
on
the
subject
dealing
with
the
laws
of
one
state
being
applicable
in
another
state,
conflict
of
laws,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
where
the
interest
of
the
state
was
paramount
then
the
laws
of
the
state
would
control.
we
have
repeated
many
times
and
sometimes
it
seemed
rather
few
were
repeated
again,
but
the
only
connection
(inaudible)
the
state
of
illinois
had
with
this
contract
was
the
fact
that
john
clay,
then
a
resident
of
illinois
took
out
a
three-year
insurance
policy
and
paid
the
premium
in
cash
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
contract
of
course
was
handed
to
him
in
the
state
of
illinois.
less
than
two
months
thereafter
according
to
the
records,
the
transcript
of
record,
clay
his
wife,
and
any
connections
that
he
had
in
chicago
who
depended
upon
him
moved
to
state
of
florida
and
became
permanent
residents.
they
first
took
up
residence
in
palm
beach,
then
in
miami
and
finally
when
this
loss
occurred
they
were
occupying
a
ranch
near
clewiston
ward
where
they
had
made
according
to
evidence,
had
made
tremendous
investments.
they
had
no
intentions
of
ever
returning
to
the
state
of
illinois.
all
of
the
damage
was
done
to
the
property
was
done
in
florida.
according
to
the
laws
of
state
of
florida,
a
man
can
steal
from
his
wife
and
the
wife
can
steal
from
the
husband.
consequently
the
acts
by
which
these
damages
were
claimed
--
constituted
a
breech
of
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
of
florida.
therefore,
they
could
not
have
been
justified
in
the
state
of
illinois.
now
the
fact
that
no
criminal
action
took
place
--
nevertheless
the
second
question
which
is
not
a
constitutional
question
and
therefore
it
is
not
answered
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
a
criminal
act
and
the
state
of
florida
had
the
interest
of
that
criminal
act
as
part
of
its
public
policy.
now
the
appellee
claims
(inaudible)
on
the
insurance
statute
state
of
florida
showing
that
in
certain
instances
the
insurance
commission
as
constituted
by
the
statutes
of
state
of
florida,
by
the
legislature
that
they
have
changed
the
policy
of
the
state
in
reference
to
numerous
insurance
policies.
however,
nowhere
in
this
laws
of
state
of
florida
and
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
florida
answered
that
because
the
insurance
code
existed
and
the
same
argument
was
made
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
realized
that
the
legislature
cannot
delegate
to
a
board
in
florida
the
right
to
legislate
and
in
no
instance
have
they
done
it.
they
have
set
up
a
code.
they
have
by
a
statutory
act
allowed
this
court
to
handle
certain
types
of
policies,
but
it
so
happened
that
this
personal
property
floater
policy
is
nowhere
mentioned
in
the
insurance
code.
florida
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
states
in
the
union.
it
is
most
important
if
31
other
states
have
the
same
laws
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
people
coming
into
the
state
of
florida
depend
upon
this
sovereign
state
to
protect
their
interests.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
florida
many
years
ago
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
sir,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
right
they
would
if
it
was
necessary
under
the
florida
--
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
well
i
think
the
insurance
commission
--
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
that
sir,
but
i
think
the
insurance
commission
--
it
requires
all
insurance
companies
qualify
to
do
business
to
retain
a
certain
--
to
have
a
certain
reserve
–
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
measured
by
the
report
that's
made
to
the
insurance
commissioner
at
the
time
that
the
company
is
qualified
to
do
business
in
florida
and
the
insurance
commissioner
probably
knows
the
amount
of
business
being
done,
but
nevertheless
i
realize
at
the
objection
of
the
insurance
company
of
the
appellee
to
this,
is
the
fact
that
when
the
loss
is
reported,
i
think
when
the
loss
is
reported
to
them,
i
am
sure
that
they
must
set
up
i
think
out
of
their
funds
sufficient
money
to
cover
the
loss
until
it
needs
to
pay
or
some
court
decides
it
is
not
a
legitimate
loss
and
i
presume
that,
that's
the
purpose
of
the
one
year
clause
in
policy
is
to
give
any
possibility
of
a
--
for
a
five
year
a
five
year
statute
limitation.
appellee
says
that,
that
is
an
old
fashioned
law.
well
maybe
it
is,
i
don't
know
but
the
state
of
florida
is
growing
legislature
maybe
inclined
it,
sometime
to
change
the
law,
but
insofar
as
the
constitution
of
state
of
florida
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
the
statutory
law
of
the
state
of
florida
is
concerned
that
is
the
law.
and
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
florida
has
said
if
this
--
that
the
statute
limitations
to
set
out
–
under
the
laws
of
the
florida
--
well
in
the
case
and
under
93,
95.03
the
courts
of
the
state
of
florida
are
required
to
recognize
that
as
the
law
of
the
state.
mr.
paschal
c.
reese
may
it
please
the
court
in
reply
to
the
mr.
cotton,
the
--
this
last
case
the
circuit
court,
the
last
case
he
referred
to
the
circuit
court
granted
the
insurance
company
a
decree
and
the
matter
was
reversed
after
the
clay
case
had
gone
to
the
court
of
law,
to
supreme
court
and
was
reversed
by
the
district
court.
as
far
as
the
policy
of
the
state
of
florida
is
concerned,
the
policy
of
the
state
of
florida
is
it
on
a
contract
such
as
this
that
the
statute
of
limitation
is
five
years
for
the
protection
of
the
citizen
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
had
never
been
changed,
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
is
the
public
policy
of
florida,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
takes
position
that
it
is
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
florida
where
sufficient
contact
exists
to
warrant
the
state
of
florida
applying
its
public
policy
and
its
laws
and
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
because
by
its
own
admission
in
its
--
and
both
of
its
opinion,
it
had
accepted
the
theory
before
a
state
has
sufficient
interest
to
protect
its
citizens,
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
forum
should
apply.
thank
you.
