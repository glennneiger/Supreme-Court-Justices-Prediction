mr.
bert
cotton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
of
all
industries
which
have
been
subject
to
the
regulations,
insurance
is
probably
the
leader
in
the
sense
that
every
state
has
an
intricate
set
of
regulations
applicable
to
the
insurance
industry
and
to
insurance
policies.
when
this
court
decided
the
south
eastern
underwriters'
case
and
held
that
the
business
of
insurance
constituted
interstate
commerce,
congress
passed
the
mccarran
act
for
the
purpose
of
leaving
the
regulation
and
control
of
the
insurance
business
with
the
several
states.
mr.
bert
cotton
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
bert
cotton
i
believe
they
were.
now
it
has
been
said
primarily
by
the
attorney
general
of
florida
that
this
was
a
contract
forced
upon
mr.
clay
in
illinois.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
form
of
contract
which
was
issued
to
mr.
clay
in
illinois
at
the
time
that
he
was
a
resident
of
illinois
was
required
by
the
law
of
illinois,
the
insurance
company
was
required
to
file
the
policy,
the
form
of
the
policy,
it
would
have
been
illegal
to
issue
to
him
any
other
form
of
policy.
the
rates
had
to
be
filed
and
were
controlled
so
that
it
would
have
been
illegal
to
have
charged
him
more
or
less
than
the
filed
rates.
the
company
was
required
by
the
law
of
illinois
to
issue
the
policy
through
a
resident
local
illinois
agent
and
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
about
reserves,
the
illinois
statute
requires
that
on
all
policies
issued
and
delivered
in
illinois
that
reserves
be
carried
in
the
event
of
loss.
and
under
the
one
yeah
suit
clause
which
is
legal
as
been
conceded
under
the
law
of
illinois,
the
reserve
on
this
loss
could
be
marked
off
at
the
end
of
one
year.
and
if
this
policy
subject
to
a
one
year
suit
clause
valid
under
the
law
of
illinois
is
to
be
subject
to
statutes
in
other
states,
which
increase
the
amount
of
time
for
which
the
reserve
must
be
maintained
then
you
have
the
mushrooming
effect
of
five
years
of
losses
which
can
have
a
very
serious
effect
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
company
and
because
of
the
states'
interest
in
the
solvency
of
insurance
companies'
premiums
can
be
very
seriously
affected.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bert
cotton
yes,
your
honor,
had
the
insurance
company
known
that
he
went
to
florida.
mr.
bert
cotton
no
sir.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
having
to
do
with
that
question
is
a
question
was
put
to
mr.
clay,
“after
you
moved
to
florida
were
you
in
contact
with
the
agent
in
illinois”
and
he
said,
“yes,”
it
does
not
appear
whether
that
contact
was
after
the
loss
occurred,
because
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
it
is
the
fact
that
mr.
clay
sent
notice
of
this
loss
directly
to
(inaudible)
and
clarkton,
in
chicago,
illinois
and
consequently
i
would
not
say
to
your
honor
that
this
one
sentence
in
the
record
tells
us
whether
the
notification
was
before
or
after
the
loss,
but
the
only
contact
that
the
record
tells
us
about
is
the
contact
after
the
loss
and
the
reportable.
mr.
bert
cotton
certainly
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
no
sir.
now
i
believe
before
we
get
to
what
is
really
the
crux
of
the
issue
and
that
is
the
study
of
the
contacts
of
florida
in
relation
to
the
contacts
elsewhere
and
the
study
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
strong
and
well
pronounced
public
policy
in
florida
sufficient
to
warrant
imposing
its
restrictive
statute
on
a
contract
made
elsewhere,
we
ought
to
consider
what
is
this
evil
that
is
said
to
be
in
here
and
in
this
clause
in
the
contract.
we
don't
have
a
watson
situation
here,
where
mrs.
watson,
a
resident
of
illinois,
uses
a
toni
home
permanent
and
is
injured
and
were
it
not
for
a
declaration
of
very
strong
interest
on
the
part
of
louisiana
that
mrs.
watson
should
have
her
remedy
in
louisiana,
she
would
have
to
go
to
massachusetts
or
illinois
or
wherever
she
could
serve
the
toni
company
or
the
gillette
company
in
order
to
recover.
they
created
not
a
new
liability
in
louisiana.
they
created
a
method
by
which
mrs.
watson
could
sue
where
she
lived
instead
of
going
elsewhere.
they
didn't
impose
on
the
insurance
company
anymore
liability
than
it
already
had.
they
simply
made
it
possible
for
mrs.
watson
to
sue
them
because
she
couldn't
sue
the
toni
company.
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
limitation
on
the
time
to
sue,
mr.
clay
was
not
the
deprived
of
any
remedy,
there
is
merely
a
limitation
on
the
time
to
sue
and
we
study
for
moment
if
your
honors
will
permit
me,
the
question
of
what
is
the
evil
have
–
have
the
legislators
concern
themselves
about
this,
had
they
considered
this
to
be
an
evil.
in
the
federal
field
we
find
that
in
various
areas
on
which
congress
has
acted,
it
has
itself
imposed
or
expressly
permitted
short
periods
of
suit.
in
the
maritime
field,
one
year
of
(inaudible)
and
in
another
statute
having
to
do
a
limited
liability,
in
the
railroad
field
they
permitted
a
two
year
period;
pipeline,
two
years;
motor
carriers,
two
years;
actions
for
charges
--
returnable
overcharges,
two
years;
sec
violations,
civil
actions
for
sec
wrongs,
one
year.
we
take
the
various
states,
the
blue
sky
laws,
two
years;
the
uniform
commercial
code
for
various
times
of
actions,
one
year.
we
take
the
insurance
field,
the
1943
new
york
standard
fire
insurance
policy
which
was
adopted
by
42
states,
contains
as
one
of
it's
provisions,
a
section
requiring
a
suit
be
instituted
within
one
year
of
the
inception
of
the
law,
so
may
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
clause
involved
in
this
case
is
one
year
from
discovery
and
not
from
inception.
and
may
i
also
call
your
honors'
attention
to
something
i
overlooked
emphasizing
before
that
within
the
suit
clause
itself
in
this
policy,
it
says
“provided
however
that
if
by
the
laws
of
the
state
within
which
this
policy
is
issued
such
limitation
is
invalid,
then
the
suit
must
be
commenced
within
the
shortest
possible
period
of
time
committed
by
the
state
in
which
the
policy
was
issued.”
now
we
turn
to
the
state
of
florida
before
we
examine
in
to
their
interest
to
see
whether
or
not
florida
really
has
a
strong
abhorrence
to
limited
periods
for
suit,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
statute
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
a
1913
statute
passed
not
as
a
specific
remedy
for
an
evil,
but
part
of
its
general
statute
of
limitations
1913
and
automatically
reenacted
every
two
years
i
think
all
the
statutes
are
reenacted,
but
let's
look
at
the
florida
insurance
law.
disability
and
accidental
death
policies,
two
year
mandatory,
florida
insurance
law,
two
year
limit,
it
permits
--
florida
insurance
law
permits
a
two
year
suit
clause
in
a
life
policy
issued
by
a
fraternal
benefit
society.
when
the
florida
insurance
commissioner
pursuant
to
the
authority
vested
in
him
by
the
florida
legislature
adopted
the
new
york
standard
fire
policy
in
43
or
44.
he
adopted
it
as-is
including
the
one
year
suit
clause.
now
i
don't
claim,
because
counsel
has
said
well
now,
the
commissioner
–
florida
insurance
commissioner
can't
overrule
the
legislature,
of
course
he
can.
my
point
is
that
we're
looking
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
strong
compelling
policy,
strong
compelling
abhorrence
of
limited
periods
for
suit
in
the
state
of
florida
and
i
point
out
that
the
insurance
commissioner
didn't
think
so
because
he
made
no
amendment
in
the
policy
when
it
was
adopted
and
made
required
in
florida.
now
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
that
florida
is
fully
aware
of
how
to
express
a
strong
public
policy
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so.
this
court
upheld
in
the
--
mr.
bert
cotton
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
according
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
said
about
this
statute,
florida
has
enough
contact
--
with
the
contract
if
you
can
bring
suit
on
the
contract
in
florida.
now
as
this
court
well
knows
practically
every
large
insurance
company
is
licensed
to
do
business
in
every
state
of
the
union.
and
i
can
have
a
loss
in
south
dakota
and
i
can
sue
the
home
insurance
company
in
florida
and
florida
has
the
–
the
florida
court
has
jurisdiction
and
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
applies
and
requires
the
one
year
suit
clause
to
be
stricken
down.
now
your
honors
will
observe
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
had
great
difficulty
applying
the
rule
or
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
because
it
was
argued
on
behalf
of
the
insurer
that
it
just
can't
be
that
the
legislature
of
florida
when
it
passed
this
1913
statute,
what
it
did
to
apply
to
every
contract
it
made
anywhere
--
mr.
bert
cotton
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
has
the
power
to
invalidate
this
provision
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
bert
cotton
i
will
think
they
would
have
to
be
two
things
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
strong
overwriting
public
interest
or
public
policy
to
start
with
and
in
addition,
i
think
it's
another
thing
that
in
addition
it
must
have
enough
contacts
because
it
may
have
the
strongest
public
policy
in
the
world
but
if
it
doesn't
have
sufficient
contact,
you
can't
apply
its
policy.
and
conversely
it
may
have
plenty
of
contacts
but
if
there
is
no
strong
public
policy
to
apply,
then
--
mr.
bert
cotton
your
honor
consider
delta
&
pine
and
the
contacts
there
which
were
held
in
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well
the
insurance
company
was
doing
business
there
and
in
many
other
states,
it's
true.
mr.
bert
cotton
but
your
honor
the
reason
that
i
mentioned
delta
&
pine
is
that
rather
than
have
my
own
characterization
of
the
importance
or
significance
of
the
contact
i
would
rather
use
this
court's
characterization
because
in
delta
&
pine,
i
can
list
many
more
contacts
that
mississippi
had
with
the
insurance
contract
than
florida
had
with
the
clay
contract,
may
i
for
just
one
moment.
mr.
bert
cotton
delta
&
pine.
and
in
watson,
the
court
the
recognized
the
delta
&
pine
rule
within
its
limits
and
pointed
out
that
was
deciding
a
different
issue
in
the
watson
case,
the
creating
of
a
remedy
to
the
citizens
of
louisiana,
we
had
a
contract
--
at
the
time
it
was
issued,
it
affected
people
in
all
--
people
all
over
the
country,
because
when
the
insurance
company
issued
a
policy
to
toni
or
as
the
gillette
company
as
i
recall
it,
that
sells
the
toni
home
permanent
preparation
in
perhaps
at
that
time
48
states
in
the
union,
the
transaction
commences,
as
a
multi
state
transaction.
ladies
in
48
states
can
be
heard
by
toni
home
permanent.
mr.
bert
cotton
i
don't
know
about
or
i
suppose
not
maybe
(inaudible)
mr.
bert
cotton
under
the
terms
of
this
policy,
it
would
have
to
be
the
five
years,
because
--
mr.
bert
cotton
yes
sir.
mr.
bert
cotton
i
would
be
certain
that
the
rate
is
not
the
same,
but
i
would
not
undertake
to
make
even
a
guess
as
to
how
they
come
here
because
--
mr.
bert
cotton
well
here
is
why
i
would
not
even
want
to
guess
because
in
the
city
of
chicago
the
risks
of
fire
are
greater,
burglary.
mr.
bert
cotton
it
might
be
i
just
don't
know
and
i
would
not
want
to
answer
that.
it
might
be,
but
by
the
same
token
i
can't
imagine
how
much
more
it
would
be.
if
you
had
to
mushroom
your
reserves
for
five
years
instead
of
one,
the
to
question
whether
or
not
premium
is
low
--
in
new
york
city
for
example,
the
premiums
on
this
type
of
policy
are
fantastic
and
i'm
sure
in
a
rural
community
in
florida
far
lower,
but
that's
because
of
the
nature
of
the
risks.
mr.
bert
cotton
now
one
more
point
that
i
would
like
to
stress,
there
has
been
consideration
of
how
the
courts
of
florida
deal
with
this
decision
of
their
supreme
court
which
now
says
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction,
i.e.
if
you
can
get
the
defendant
in
florida
then
the
statute
applies.
they
are
apparently
not
interested
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
party
protected
the
plaintiff
is
a
resident
or
not
because
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
came
shortly
after
the
supreme
court
of
florida
issued
its
ruling
in
the
clay
case,
they
applied
it
in
favor
of
a
non
resident
who
sustained
a
loss
on
a
boat
in
the
offshore
waters
having
i
think
made
this
contract
in
new
york
or
new
jersey.
and
so
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
as
long
as
the
defendant
can
be
sued
in
florida,
the
statute
applies.
