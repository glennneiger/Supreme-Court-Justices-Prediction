mr.
james
t.
carlisle
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
first
of
all
to
thank
this
honorable
body
for
granting
me
the
honor,
the
privilege
of
the
presenting
the
interest
of
the
state
of
florida.
in
watson
versus
employers
liability,
this
court
held
that
based
on
states'
duty
to
protect
its
citizens,
the
state
may
seize
hold
of
local
activity
of
multi
state
transactions
and
regulate
to
protect
its
own
people.
in
carroll
v.
lanza,
based
upon
the
holding
in
the
watson
case,
this
court
held
to
the
state
could,
supplement
or
dispose
of
another
states'
workmen's
compensation
law
if
the
former
state's
interest
were
sufficient.
florida
does
not
wish
to
disregard
another
states
law
as
in
carroll
v.
lanza.
florida
merely
wishes
to
disregard
a
suit
clause
in
a
contract
which
is
admittedly
valid
in
the
state
of
illinois.
we
may
do
so,
according
to
the
holdings
of
this
court,
if
our
interest
is
sufficient.
now
on
speaking
of
the
interest
of
a
court
or
of
the
interest
of
the
state
rather,
we
often
speak
of
contacts.
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
black
in
the
times
that
the
court
previously
had
occasion
to
consider
this
same
case,
said
that
shortly
after
the
contract
was
made,
mr.
clay
moved
to
the
state
of
florida.
his
insured
property
was
there
all
that
time
meaning
from
the
time
that
he
moved.
the
company
knew
this
fact
particularly
since
the
company
was
licensed
to
do
business
in
florida,
it
must
have
known
that
it
might
be
sued
there
and
that
the
florida
courts
would
feel
bound
by
florida
law.
mr.
reeves
has
gone
through
a
great
many
other
contacts
that
the
florida
courts
would
have
had
with
the
case.
also
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
only
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
mr.
clay
paid
his
premium
in
a
lump
sum
for
this
three-year
policy
that
left
that
contact
of
payment
in
illinois
rather
than
in
florida.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
when
we
say
significant
contacts
we
are
only
saying
in
another,
we
are
using
another
language
to
say
whether
a
state
has
sufficient
interest
or
not.
and
so
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
florida
to
show
what
the
interest
of
the
state
is.
now
i
am
advised
by
the
development
commission
of
the
state
of
florida
based
upon
figures
from
the
bureau
of
census
that
170,000
persons
migrate
from
other
states
to
the
state
of
florida
to
become
residents,
permanent
residents
of
the
state
of
florida
per
year.
this
is
a
tremendous
growth.
the
florida
is
numbered
three
in
the
rate
of
growth
in
the
united
states.
many
of
these
people
who
moved
to
the
state
of
florida
have
entered
into
contracts
of
insurance
outside
of
the
state.
these
contracts
undertake
to
protect
our
citizens'
lives
and
their
property.
now
in
the
watson
case
great
emphasis
was
placed
upon
louisiana's
interest
in
protecting
its
citizens
and
seeing
through
that
they
did
not
become
wards
of
the
states
because
they
were
destitute.
admittedly
in
the
watson
we
were
concerned
with
injuries.
florida
in
this
case
occupies
a
similar
position,
where
a
merely
technical
escape
clause
in
an
insurance
contract
which
is
violative
of
florida
law
and
florida's
public
policy,
permitted
to
stand
florida
residence
could
also
become
destitute
while
not
through
injuries
this
time
but
because
their
assets
had
been
destroyed
through
one
means
or
another
or
because
their
providers
have
died
and
an
insurance
company
would
not
pay
because
of
this
escape
clause.
one
other
point
i
think
is
relevant
here
is
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
contract
which
is
made
in
an
arms
length
basis,
we
are
dealing
with
a
forum
contract,
an
insurance
company
and
many
of
the
people
who
come
to
florida
are
not
--
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
an
insurance
company
when
they
enter
into
this
contract
in
that
one
it
is
a
forum
contract
and
even
if
they
have
the
opportunity
to
bargain,
their
educational
background
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
do
so.
no
more
cogent
reason
exist
for
a
state
to
reach
out
and
lay
hold
of
local
activities
of
multistate
transactions
then
a
states'
interest
and
responsibility
to
enforce
its
laws
for
the
protection
of
its
residence
and
their
property.
thank
you.
