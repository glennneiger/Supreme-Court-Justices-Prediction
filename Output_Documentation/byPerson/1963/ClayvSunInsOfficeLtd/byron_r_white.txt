who

who
was
(inaudible)
justice

which
state
--
would
florida
require
this
insurance
company
to
maintain
a
reserve
to
cover
this
kind
of
a
loss,
where
the
loss
were
covered
by
a
policy
issued
in
another
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
ever
--
how
would
they
ever
know
--
how
would
they
ever
know
that
this
policy
had
issued?
i
mean
illinois
has
certainly
included
this
policy
on
what
reserves
this
company
was
require
to
maintain,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
measured
by
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
comes
to
us
with
the
state
interpretation,
florida
really
didn't
intend
this
to
apply
this
particular
time
of
a
situation
which
is
just
as
though
--
were
written
in
the
insurance
code.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
a
â€“
this
just
isn't
a
question
of
choice
of
law
or
purposes
of
conflict
of
law
at
all
of
determining
whether
state
has
got
enough
contacts
to
apply
its
law
to
a
case,
the
question
of
invalidating
the
provision
of
the
contracts.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
there
has
to
be
you
think
some
overwriting
state
interest
expressed
other
than
just
some
contact.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
think
there
is
--
you
certainly
would
admit
there
are
quite
a
few
contacts
there
that
the
state
of
florida
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
forget
delta
&
pine,
what
the
legal
significance
of
the
contacts
are,
but
there
are
significant
contacts
here.
i
mean
the
property
was
there,
the
insured
was
there,
the
insurance
company
was
doing
business
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
still
there.
