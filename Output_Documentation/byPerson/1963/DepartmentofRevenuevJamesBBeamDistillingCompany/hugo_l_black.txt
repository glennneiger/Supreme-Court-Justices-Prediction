oh,
if
kentucky
would
decide
that
it
doesn't
want
any
type
of
whisky
coming
in
that,
it
wants
to
sell
only
bourbon
made
in
kentucky,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
permit
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
before
twenty-first
amendment,
of
course,
they
took
a
webb-kenyon
act
to
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
it
not?
but
when
the
--
this
amendment
came
on,
in
fact,
they
codified
the
webb-kenyon
act,
did
it
not,
in
that
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
understanding,
was
it
not,
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
the
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
permitted
to
be
brought
in
or
not
brought
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
it
all
made
in
the
states
if
it
has
to
have
complete
control
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
liquor
transaction
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
lot
is
moving?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
the
debates
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
that
amendment
by
the
senate
and
the
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
enlighten
to
your
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
that
necessarily
follow?
it
might
have
prevented.
it
might
have
left
the
state
free
control
of
liquor,
coming
and
stopping
in
its
borders,
staying
there,
being
so
aware
or
anything
else
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
until
have
left
the
--
the
commerce
free
to
flow
through
the
state.
so
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.

what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
could
prohibit
any
from
coming
in
there,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
contributed
it
from
--
it
could
prevent
its
being
stored
there,
couldn't
it,
in
that
state
of
kentucky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
the
way
you
understand
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that's
the
way
we
held
it
in
the
young's
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
young
and
steiner
and
--
didn't
they
hold
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
hold
that
the
state
was
given
complete
control
of
the
regulation?
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
state
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state's
power
to
control
liquor
that
comes
from
abroad
and
state
power
to
control
liquor
that
comes
from
another
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
the
history
of
the
debate
and
so
forth
in
connection
with
this
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
you
have
cited
any
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
a
permission
or
repealing
the
prohibition
law,
national
prohibition
law,
i
think
you
will
find
on

condition
that
left

whether
the
liquor
should
come
in
there,
whether
it
should
stay
there
or
what
could
happen
with
it
after
it
got
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not.
did
you
look
at
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
any
indication
from
any
of
the
debates
or
reports
that
indicates
that
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
were
you
reading
from
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
state
of
kentucky
can
prevent
it,
could
require
a
license
by
importing
liquor
from
abroad,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
importing
it
into
the
state
of
kentucky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
about
a
100
years
before
the
passage
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
oil
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
did
you
say
that's
the
history
of
the
--
history
of
the
amendment
shows
that?
why
did
they
put
in
there?
what
they
did?
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
the
amendment
which
prohibits
the
transportation
or
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
abrogated
the
right
to
import
free,
so
far
as
concerned,
the
intoxicating
liquors.
has
anyone
that
hadn't
said,
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
limitation
of
the
broad
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
sanctioned
by
history
and
by
the
decision
of
this
court
on
the
wilson
act,
the
webb-kenyon
act
and
the
(inaudible)
amendment
that
you
could
have

we
think
the
language
of
the
amendment
is
clear,
we
do
not
discuss
these
matters.
it
prohibits
--
it's
allowed
them
to
handle
the
importers,
handling
intoxicating
liquors
in
their
state?
justice
hugo

doesn't
it
--
justice
hugo

--
but
it
was
intoxicating
liquors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
two
by
mr.
justice
brandeis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
wholly
free
as
the
court
said
they
did
in
young,
with
reference
to
liquor
that's
imported
from
abroad
--
justice
hugo

but
it
did
intend
to
give
them
that
freedom?
