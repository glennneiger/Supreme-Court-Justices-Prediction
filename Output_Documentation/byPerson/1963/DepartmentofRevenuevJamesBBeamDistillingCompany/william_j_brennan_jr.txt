(inaudible)
and
you've
emphasized
--
sufficed,
i
think,
that
whatever
the
packages
may
be
in
which
the
liquor
is
and
when
the
stock
arrives
in
that
form
when
it
gets
to
the
border
of
kentucky,
kentucky
says,
"no
further
unless
you
pay
10
cents
a
gallon
--
justice

j.
brennan,

there's
no
break
up
of
the
package
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
let's
see.
you
don't
--
it's
not
your
position
that
kentucky
couldn't
say,
"you
can't
bring
up
liquor
in
the
state."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
only
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
"you
cannot
stay
because
of
import-export
imposed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
why
you
can't
impose
the
tariff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
can't
say
you
can't
bring
it
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
it
was
suggested
by
mr.
cox
in
--
on
his
view
of
the
brief.
but
are
you
saying
something
like
this
that
this
is
no
different
than
the
kentucky
said,
"it
cost
us
$10
to
process
these
papers
and
if
you
are
coming
into
our
state,
you
have
to
pay
$10
to
help
us
cover
the
cost
of
processing
the
papers,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
10
cents
per
gallon
is
exactly
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
real
reason
in
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
anything
like
my
$10
