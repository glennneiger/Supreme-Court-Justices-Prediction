mr.
william
s.
riley
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
s.
riley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
our
case
is
fairly
simple.
can
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
levy
an
occupational
or
a
license
control
tax
on
the
business
of
respondent
that
bid
is
being
the
bringing
of
scotch
whisky
into
the
commonwealth
which
is
complementary
to
a
like
tax
on
the
business
of
distilling
or
manufacturing
whisky
in
the
commonwealth
without
violating
the
import-export
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
now,
by
regulation,
this
tax
is
made
payable
at
the
time
the
import
permits
are
obtained
from
the
commonwealth.
but
the
statute
provides
that
the
tax
could
be
paid
as
late
as
15
days
after
the
whisky
had
reached
the
respondent's
bonded
warehouse,
his
private
bonded
warehouse.
but
as
a
matter
of
control,
it's
made
payable
at
the
time
of
entry.
as
briefly
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
the
respondent
had
contracted
with
a
scotch
distiller
to
purchase
several
thousand
gallons
of
scotch
whisky
in
the
original
casks
and
some
in
bottles,
already
cased
for
the
consumer
market,
shipped
from
the
port
of
glasgow,
scotland
moved
to
ports
of
chicago
and
new
orleans.
there
it
was
unloaded
in
customs
bond,
placed
on
an
approved
bonded
carrier
and
transported
to
louisville,
kentucky.
from
there,
it
was
picked
up
by
another
approved
bonded
carrier
and
moved
to
the
respondent's
place
of
business
in
clermont,
kentucky,
his
private
bonded
warehouse.
now,
some
of
this
whisky
was
in
about
185%
proof,
it's
not
drinkable
until
it's
removed
from
the
cask,
distilled
water
is
added,
in
other
word,
is
cut.
some
of
it
of
course
was
already
bottled.
as
early
as
1890,
in
the
wilson
act
in
1913
and
in
the
webb-kenyon
act,
congress
gave
its
consent
to
state
regulation
of
liquor
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
original
package.
and
this
court
affirmed
that
grant
of
power
in
1913,
de
bary
against
louisiana.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
we
believe
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
treated
this
type
of
product
of
--
as
a
unique
type
of
product
and
has
reserved
to
the
states
the
absolute
control
up
to
the
point
of
prohibiting
it.
and
as
your
honors
know
in
many
states,
there
is
local
option
which
absolutely
prohibits
liquor
in
many
counties
and
that's
true
in
kentucky.
the
only
thing
that
kentucky
is
doing
here
is
attempting
to
control
the
entry
of
this
whisky
into
the
state,
as
this
court
permitted
in
gordon
against
texas.
in
fact,
the
gordon
case
is
absolute
on
all
force
with
what
kentucky
is
trying
to
do
here.
there,
the
state
of
texas
was
permitted
to
collect
its
import
tax
on
several
gallons
of
rum
in
an
individual's
car
which
he
was
carrying
across
the
state
of
texas
into
his
home
in
north
carolina.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no,
sir,
it
was
not
in
bond
but
that
the
principle
is
the
same,
if
your
honor
please.
the
individual
was
arrested
and
required
to
pay
a
fine
and
pay
the
tax
as
a
matter
of
control.
that's
what
kentucky
is
trying
to
do
here
and
of
course,
this
court
affirmed
the
case
per
curiam,
citing
carter
against
virginia,
where
this
court
permitted
that
very
same
thing
to
take
place.
the
state
of
virginia
to
seize
whisky
moving
across
that
state
from
a
point
outside
of
virginia
to
a
point
in
north
carolina
because
the
bonding
and
moving
requirements
had
not
been
met
with
and
it
cited,
of
course,
the
carter
case
cites
ziffrin
against
reeves
which
arose
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
where
kentucky
was
permitted
to
seize
whisky
that
was
moving
on
routes
in
the
state
which
had
been
approved
by
kentucky's
alcoholic
beverage
control
board.
mr.
william
s.
riley
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
well,
it
maybe
withdrawn
from
bond
and
sold.
mr.
william
s.
riley
in
kentucky,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no,
we're
dealing
only
with
that
that
is
being
brought
into
kentucky
in
bond
and
put
in
the
private
bonded
warehouse.
mr.
william
s.
riley
yes,
from
a
--
from
a
foreign
country.
mr.
william
s.
riley
and
as
a
matter
of
control,
as
a
revenue
measure,
it
is
kentucky's
position
that
in
conformity
with
the
gordon
case,
that
kentucky
has
the
absolute
right
to
or
to
apply
the
tax,
its
regulatory
tax,
its
license
tax
on
the
business
of
bringing
this
whisky
into
the
state.
now,
as
your
honors
know,
kentucky
is
a
large
producer
of
bourbon
whisky.
this
tax
is
a
complementary
tax
which
is
required
to
be
paid
by
the
bourbon
distillers
on
whisky
that
is
produced
in
the
tax
--
in
the
state.
it
is
the
commonwealth's
position
therefore
that
the
state
should
not
be
--
that
scotch
whisky
should
not
be
given
a
tax
advantage
over
kentucky
whisky,
kentucky
bourbon
whisky.
and
as
a
matter
of
control,
as
a
matter
of
keeping
under
regulation
this
unique
type
of
property
that
the
imported
whisky
should
be
held
liable
to
this
tax,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
the
state
the
absolute
power
to
do
so
and
that
gordon
against
texas
is
an
expression
of
this
court
in
giving
the
state
that
power.
mr.
william
s.
riley
it
comes
in
through
new
orleans
or
chicago.
mr.
william
s.
riley
it's
unloaded
with
water.
it
went
under
the
dock
and
placed
on
--
in
a
through
customs-bonded
transporter.
mr.
william
s.
riley
it's
bonded
all
the
way.
it's
covered
by
--
it's
in
federal
bond
all
the
way.
mr.
william
s.
riley
to
my
understanding,
the
respondent
has
title
to
the
whisky.
mr.
william
s.
riley
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
it
is
my
contention,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
--
would
permit
that.
mr.
william
s.
riley
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
in
that
respect.
mr.
william
s.
riley
that
is
my
understanding,
if
the
court
please.
now,
of
course,
as
mr.
goff
(ph)
pointed
out
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
in
his
--
in
the
opinion
--
in
the
concurring
opinion,
he
has
pointed
out
that
the
state
could
levy
any
tax
or
any
regulatory
measure
that
it
so
desires
under
the
--
mr.
william
s.
riley
are
brought
--
are
not
brought
in.
mr.
william
s.
riley
absolute
control.
mr.
william
s.
riley
in
the
state.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no.
it
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
--
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
board
must
be
advised
of
all
whisky
that
moves
in
kentucky
in
any
fashion
through
the
state
or
to
warehouses
in
the
state.
and
it
must
determine
--
it
must
--
a
route
must
be
given
and
the
exact
movement
of
that
whisky
must
be
known
at
all
times.
mr.
william
s.
riley
i
believe
under
the
gordon
case,
yes,
we
could.
mr.
william
s.
riley
under
the
gordon
case,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no,
if
it
comes
--
well,
it's
in
the
possession
of
the
individual
in
kentucky.
mr.
william
s.
riley
well,
whether
we
could
tax
it
or
not
as
a
matter
of
control,
probably,
not
but
we
can
control
its
movement,
absolutely,
yes,
i
believe
we
could.
now,
whether
this
is
a
tax
on
the
possession
of
the
whisky,
first
possession
of
the
whisky
in
kentucky,
if
your
honor
please,
not
on
the
movement
over
--
to
the
state.
mr.
william
s.
riley
that's
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no,
i
have
not.
mr.
william
s.
riley
thank
you.
mr.
william
s.
riley
i
have
one
or
two
things,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
like
to
bring
out.
first
of
all,
i
believe
the
federal
alcoholic
administration
tax
itself
recognizes
the
states'
power
to
control
the
commerce
and
alcoholic
beverages,
it's
27
u.s.c.
204
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
of
treasury
--
mr.
william
s.
riley
well,
no,
that
the
state
itself
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
catch
that
up.
i
thought
he
was
maintaining
here
that
the
federal
government
could
absolutely
control
it
by
the
--
the
act.
mr.
william
s.
riley
that's
right.
mr.
william
s.
riley
package.
mr.
william
s.
riley
i
understand
it.
mr.
william
s.
riley
the
issue
is
both
regulation
and
taxations.
mr.
william
s.
riley
the
--
the
act
requires
that
the
permit
be
obtained
by
the
importer.
mr.
william
s.
riley
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
s.
riley
and
as
a
--
as
a
revenue
and
control
measure
then
there
is
a
10-cent
fee
for
the
permit
for
proof
gallon
at
the
time
the
permit
is
purchased
before
the
liquor
is
brought
into
the
state.
mr.
william
s.
riley
both
a
regulatory
and
revenue
measure.
mr.
william
s.
riley
i
believe
that
that
is,
if
your
--
if
the
court
please,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
immaterial
here
because
it's
both
regulatory
and
revenue
and
it
is
a
complementary.
it
is
a
tax
which
is
complementary
to
the
tax
on
the
distilling
or
manufacturing.
it's
to
make
it
competitive
with
bourbon
whisky
manufactured
in
the
state.
and
it
is
not
on
the
whisky
directly
but
it's
on
the
business
of
bringing
the
whisky
into
the
state
and
the
business
of
manufacturing
or
distilling
it.
mr.
william
s.
riley
to
make
it
competitive,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
even
though
it's
in
the
original
package
and
it's
being
brought
into
the
state.
mr.
william
s.
riley
twenty-first
amendment,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
not
exactly,
because
there
is
also
a
10-cent
tax
on
distilling
bourbon
whisky
for
proof
gallon
in
kentucky.
and
to
make
it
competitive
and
for
the
permit
--
mr.
william
s.
riley
that's
the
real
reason,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
riley
no.
mr.
william
s.
riley
it
--
the
--
the
state
court
construed
it
in
its
very
opinion
--
mr.
william
s.
riley
there's
an
--
as
a
tax
on
the
act
of
bringing
the
whisky
into
the
state
as
it
had
been
construed
by
the
state
court
over
50
years
ago
and
this
court
agreed
to
it.
thank
you.
