mr.
millard
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
question
involved
in
this
case,
as
i
see
it,
is
whether
or
not
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
repealed
pro
tanto
the
import-export
clause
of
the
constitution
being
article
i,
section
10,
clause
2.
now,
if
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
done
that
and
i
have
no
standing
in
court.
but
i
insist
that
isn't
so,
as
the
authorities
would
bear
me
out.
i
would
like
to
trace
very
briefly,
as
suggested
by
justice
stewart
a
while
ago,
the
movement
of
this
liquor.
the
james
b.
beam
distilling
company
owns
and
operates
a
bourbon
distillery
at
clermont,
kentucky,
which
is
near
bardstown,
about
50
miles
from
louisville.
it
also
has
a
contract
with
the
gilbey
company
of
london
--
england,
william
e.
gilbey
&
son
by
which
the
beam
company
has
become
the
sole
distributor
of
a
brand
of
scotch
whisky
known
as
"gilbey's
spey
royal"
in
the
united
states.
beam
places
an
order
by
mail
or
telegraph
or
telephone
with
gilbey
in
london.
the
whisky
is
loaded
on
shipboard
in
glasgow,
scotland,
proceeds
across
the
atlantic
either
through
the
port
of
new
orleans
but
generally,
more
often
through
the
port
of
chicago
that
is
through
the
saint
lawrence
seaway
down
through
lake
michigan
to
the
port
of
chicago.
now,
under
custom's
regulations,
that
whisky
is
traveling
in
bond.
the
mast
of
the
ship
must
present
to
the
customs
officer
in
chicago
a
manifest
showing
just
what
whisky
is
on
board,
what
do
imported
whisky
is
on
board,
to
whom
it
is
consigned
and
the
quantity
in
gallons
or
cases,
whatever
it
happens
to
be.
at
the
dock
in
chicago
has
received
in
customs
bond.
then
the
next
step
on
the
treasury
regulations,
a
carrier
who
has
received
a
permit
from
the
customs
official,
picks
up
that
liquor,
he
receives
an
inventory
of
it
and
hauls
it
down
through
the
state
of
indiana
under
his
carrier's
permit
and
with
the
bill
of
lading
in
customs
bond,
the
seal
of
the
government
on
the
truck
to
louisville.
the
river
--
at
the
--at
the
river,
the
ohio
river,
the
boundary
between
indiana
and
kentucky,
kentucky
says,
“stop.
you
cannot
bring
this
liquor
into
the
state
of
kentucky
until
you
obtain
from
our
department
of
revenue
a
permit
for
which
you
have
to
pay
in
advance
of
bringing
it
into
the
state
the
sum
of
10
cents
a
proof
gallon.”
now,
in
the
record
--
mr.
millard
cox
the
proof
gallon
is
a
--
is
a
gallon
of
liquor
at
a
100
degrees
proof,
the
proof
being
50%
of
alcohol
per
volume.
mr.
millard
cox
10
cents.
now,
if
it's
86
proof,
it
would
be,
let's
see,
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
millard
cox
13
--
yes,
13.5
cents
less.
these
permits,
if
the
court
please,
all
appear
in
the
record
as
beginning
at
--
on
page
8
and
i
think
my
friend,
mr.
riley
said
that
some
of
this
liquor
comes
in
to
185
proof
which
should
be
almost
pure
alcohol
a
dozen.
it
comes
in,
i
think
the
highest
proof
you
buy
is
a
120
proof
and
a
great
deal
of
it
is
in
cases.
all
bottled.
well,
the
beam
distilling
company,
before
it
can
bring
that
liquor
across
the
river
in
to
kentucky,
must
apply
to
the
department
of
revenue
at
frankfort
for
a
permit,
designated
as
an
import
permit,
and
must
describe
the
number
of
gallons
to
be
imported
and
must
pay
the
tax
at
the
rate
of
10
cents
a
gallon.
all
of
which
appear
on
the
photostats
of
the
permits
in
the
record.
this
permit
is
issued
in
triplicate.
one
copy
of
it
goes
to
the
carrier
who
is
going
to
bring
this
liquor
from
the
customs
depot
in
louisville
to
the
distillery
of
clermont,
kentucky.
and
he
presents
two
--
two
documents.
he
presents
to
the
customs
official
his
permit
to
carry
the
liquor
as
a
registered
customs
carrier.
and
number
two,
the
kentucky
permit
which
was
approved,
as
this
court
will
recall
in
ziffrin
against
reeves,
and
that's
a
$10
annual
permit
which
the
carrier
must
have
in
his
possession
so
that
if
a
kentucky
inspector
should
come
along
and
say,
"by
what
authority
you're
hauling
this
liquor,"
he
can
exhibit
his
permit.
and
the
permit,
i
brought
a
copy
of
it
here,
is
a
simple
document,
$10
a
year.
and
this
one
is
issued
to
the
one
who
brought
the
liquor
from
the
port
in
louisville
to
clermont,
kentucky
known
as
the
robert
rice
incorporated
trucking
line
of
shepherdsville,
kentucky
and
the
permit
number
is
ts-249.
well,
the
--
the
whisky
finally
arrives
at
the
distillery
in
kentucky.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
it's
been
upheld
by
the
court
here.
we
--
we
think
it's
a
reasonable
--
reasonable
regulation
and
to
prevent
diversion
even
though
the
federal
government
is,
even
though
this
whisky
is
traveling
in
customs
bond,
we
think
the
cooperation
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
is
perfectly
proper
to
see
that
this
liquor
is
not
diverted
to
illegal
channel.
the
whisky
arrives
in
at
shepherdsville
at
the
beam
distilling
company
--
i
mean
at
clermont,
kentucky,
at
the
beam
distilling
company
and
it's
immediately
put
into
their
class
2
or
class
8
customs-bonded
warehouse.
all
of
which
are
--
are
provided
for
in
the
treasury
regulations.
the
number
2
house
being
an
import
customs
bond
and
the
number
8
being
an
import
customs-bonded
warehouse,
wherein
the
manufacture
--
the
further
manufacture
may
take
place,
which
means
in
this
case,
and
it's
been
defined
as
manufacture
by
the
simply
reduction
in
proof.
if
the
whisky
is
101
proof,
sufficient
distilled
water
is
added
to
bring
it
down
to
86.6
proof
which
is
the
customary
proof
at
which
scotch
whisky
is
sold
in
the
consumer
market
in
the
united
states.
well,
when
beam
wants
to
withdraw
this
whisky
from
customs
bond,
he
must
pay
two
types
of
taxes.
he
must
pay
the
internal
revenue
tax
of
$10.50
proof
gallon.
he
must
also
pay
the
import
tax
of
$1.27
a
gallon,
the
customs
officer
collecting
that
tax,
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division
collecting
the
other
one.
that,
in
brief,
your
honors,
is
the
method
in
which
this
whisky
is
received
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
taxing
point
is
at
the
state
line.
they
say
you
--
kentucky
says,
“you
cannot
bring
this
whisky
into
the
state
until
you
pay
the
10-cent
tax.”
mr.
millard
cox
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
millard
cox
i
might
add,
however,
that
once
it
goes
out
of
the
warehouse,
it
is
distributed
all
over
the
united
states,
some
of
it
finds
its
way
to
wholesalers
in
the
state
of
kentucky.
and
there,
it
becomes,
under
the
decision
of
brown
against
maryland,
it
becomes
subject
to
the
kentucky
excise
tax
of
$1.28
a
gallon.
and
it's
taxed
in
the
hands
of
the
--
the
first
--
at
the
time
of
the
first
sale.
and
then
if
it's
in
the
warehouse,
after
the
first
sale
in
a
wholesaler's
warehouse
or
retailer's
warehouse
on
the
ad
valorem
assessment
date,
the
first
of
january
in
kentucky,
it's
subject
to
ad
valorem
tax.
but
the
only
tax
that
we
contend
it
is
not
subject
to
is
the
import
tax
and
we
say
it
cannot
be
subjected
to
that
tax
unless
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
had
the
effect
of
repealing
pro
tanto
the
import-export
clause.
mr.
millard
cox
it
can
--
mr.
millard
cox
no,
kentucky
can
prohibit
it
entirely
as
could
prohibit
all
liquor.
mr.
millard
cox
kentucky
could
--
could
have
prohibition
if
it
wanted
to.
mr.
millard
cox
it
could
prohibit
any
from
coming
in.
yes.
mr.
millard
cox
it
could
prohibit
it
absolutely.
yes.
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
that
--
that's
correct.
well,
no,
the
young
case
--
no,
the
--
the
young's
marketing
case.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
millard
cox
that
was
in
--
under
the
interstate
--
under
the
interstate
--
under
--
in
--interstate
commerce,
not
--
not
to
imports.
and
i
might
--
i'd
like
to
read
--
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
it
does.
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference.
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
yes,
indeed.
yes,
indeed,
it
does.
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
i
have.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
difference
at
this
point.
the
--
the
import-export
clause
prohibits
absolutely
a
state
from
levying
any
imports
or
exports
on
--
except
what
may
absolutely
be
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
inspection
laws.
it's
--
it's
a
prohibition
against
the
state
levying
any
sort
of
tax.
mr.
millard
cox
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
i
do
not
and
i
--
and
the
reason
i
--
mr.
millard
cox
well,
i
can
--
the
only
and
the
best
indication
is
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
millard
cox
that
was
the
case
of
william
jameson
&
company
against
morgenthau.
now,
immediately
after
the
repeal
of
prohibition,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
enacted
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act.
now,
that
gives
the
--
it
--
at
that
time,
it
was
an
independent
agency
of
the
federal
government.
since
then
it
has
been
covered
into
the
internal
revenue
department
and
there's
a
branch
of
the
internal
revenue
service
known
as
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division.
now,
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
gave
the
federal
government
broad
authority
over
the
labeling
of
alcoholic
liquors.
there,
you
--
it
have
to
be
labeled
in
a
certain
way.
they
--
every
--
everybody
dealing
in
alcoholic
liquors,
except
retailers,
must
have
a
basic
permit.
before
you
can
import
alcoholic
liquors,
you
have
to
have
a
basic
permit
from
the
federal
government.
and
jameson
contended
that
they
did
not
have
to
have
this
permit
because
this
matter
had
been
taken
entirely
out
of
the
hands
of
congress
and
if
it
turned
over,
carte
blanche
to
the
states.
and
that
case
came
to
the
court
here
and
the
--
the
jameson
people
had
contended
that
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
twenty-first
amendment.
well,
the
court,
this
court
made
short
shrift
to
that
contention
and
is
reported
the
william
jameson
case,
it's
in
307
u.s.
171.
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
substance
to
the
contention
that
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act,
that's
at
27
u.s.
code
201,
section
211
was
unconstitutional
because
the
twenty-first
amendment
gave
the
states
complete
and
exclusive
control
over
commerce
in
intoxicating
liquors.
in
other
words,
they
--
this
court
said
the
--
the
states
do
not
have
complete
control
over
intoxicating
liquors.
this
act
is
constitutional.
now,
i
like
to
point
one
further
matter
--
mr.
millard
cox
oh,
that
was
the
--
mr.
millard
cox
william
jameson
&
company
against
morgenthau.
it's
cited
in
my
brief
and
appears
in
the
lengthy
opinion
on
the
california
court
which
i
quote
rather
fully
in
my
brief,
the
parrott
case.
now,
in
the
manner
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
import-export
clause,
i
think
we've
got
to
recognize
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
two.
the
commerce
clause
gives
congress
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
between
the
states
and
the
import-export
clause
is
cast
in
an
entirely
different
thing.
it
simply
prohibits
the
states
from
levying
any
tax
on
imports
or
exports
and
congress
doesn't
have
anything
to
say
about
it.
mr.
millard
cox
come
into
it
but
not
through
it.
mr.
millard
cox
yes.
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
millard
cox
--
i
don't
agree
with
it.
mr.
millard
cox
no.
mr.
millard
cox
well
--
mr.
millard
cox
well,
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
import-export
clause,
it
cannot
tax
it.
it
could
prohibit
it
entirely
but
it
cannot
tax
it
because
the
import-export
clause
stands
as
a
barrier
against
taxation.
that's
--
that's
the
whole
clause.
that's
the
whole
import
of
the
clause.
i'd
like
to
read
just
briefly
--
mr.
millard
cox
require
an
import
license?
mr.
millard
cox
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
millard
cox
no,
sir,
because
that's
the
brown
against
maryland
case.
that's
exactly
what
was
held
in
--
in
brown
against
maryland
which
is
137
years
ago.
the
--
the
state
of
maryland
levied
an
annual
license
tax
of
$50
on
importers.
mr.
millard
cox
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
as
to
commerce,
as
to
the
regulation
of
commerce,
i
think
the
distinction
between
that
and
the
clause
we're
dealing
with,
the
import-export
clause
is
very
lucidly
pointed
out
in
the
richfield
oil
company
case
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
spoke
for
the
majority.
mr.
millard
cox
that
was
oil,
yes,
but
i
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
difference
between
the
commerce
clause
and
the
--
and
the
import-export
clause
which
are
cast
in
an
entirely
different
terms.
one
gives
congress
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
and
the
other
is
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
state
levying
any
tax
on
an
import.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
this,
“the
law,
under
the
commerce
clause,
has
been
fashioned
by
the
court
in
an
effort
to
reconcile
competing
constitutional
demands
that
commerce
between
the
states
shall
not
be
unduly
impeded
by
state
action
and
that
the
power
to
lay
taxes
for
the
support
of
state
government
shall
not
be
unduly
curtailed.
that
accommodation
has
been
made
by
upholding
taxes
designed
to
make
interstate
commerce
bear
a
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
local
government
from
which
it
receives
benefits.
and
by
invalidating
those
which
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
which
impose
a
levy
for
the
privilege
of
doing
it,
which
place
an
undue
burden
on
it.
it
seems
clear
that
we
cannot
write
any
such
qualification
into
the
import-export
clause.
it
prohibits
every
state
from
laying
any
tax
on
imports
or
exports
without
the
consent
of
congress.
it
would
entail
a
substantial
revision
of
the
import-export
clause
to
substitute
for
the
prohibition
against
any
tax,
a
prohibition
against
any
discriminatory
tax.
the
two
clauses,
though
complimentary,
serve
different
ends.
and
the
limitation
of
one
cannot
be
read
into
the
other."
now,
getting
back
to
the
--
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
there
was
no
indication
when
that
amendment
was
passed
that
it
was
intended
to
repeal
and
the
other
amendment
of
the
constitution
except
the
eighteenth.
and
we
know
that
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored.
mr.
millard
cox
mr.
justice
black,
they
were
dealing
there
with
interstate
commerce.
they
--
mr.
millard
cox
yes.
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
but
the
interstate
commerce
has
related
the
interstate
commerce,
not
--
not
foreign
commerce,
not
imports.
now,
i
will
grant
you
that
there's
some
very
broad
language
in
those
early
decisions
and
particularly
in
--
in
justice
mcreynolds'
opinion
on
the
ziffrin
case
which
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
the
states
can
do
anything
they
want
to
with
intoxicating
liquor
and
that
the
federal
government
has
no
right
to
do
anything
about
it
at
all.
mr.
millard
cox
well,
i
--
i
say
the
--
the
language
in
there
is
very
broad.
but
if
you'll
read
my
brief,
the
--
the
decision
i
quoted
in
there
from
the
california
court,
they
distinguished
--
they
--
they
--
that
was
dicta
in
those
--
in
those
case.
they
were
not
dealing
with
this
question
we
have
here,
this
question
has
never
been
before
you.
this
is
the
first
time
it's
been
here.
mr.
millard
cox
that's
right.
mr.
millard
cox
after
it
had
been
put
to
use,
well,
that
--
which
--
mr.
millard
cox
well,
i'd
say
this.
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court,
this
--
this
is
the
exemption
from
taxation.
in
the
first
place,
the
liquor
--
the
product
will
say
must
come,
have
come
from
a
foreign
country.
it
must
be
still
in
their
original
packages.
mr.
millard
cox
prior
to
sale
and
prior
to
use
by
the
original
importer.
now,
once
it
gets
to
the
channels
of
trade,
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
taxable
property
in
the
state
and
it's
subject
to
all
the
taxes.
mr.
millard
cox
are
you
--
you're
suggesting
that
it
might
have
come
to
rest
in
the
state
and
become
a
mass
of
the
general
property
in
that
way?
mr.
millard
cox
well,
i'll
say
this
--
mr.
millard
cox
no,
beam
brings
his
whisky
here,
of
course,
for
sale
and
distribution.
and
in
order
to
sell
it,
in
order
to
get
it
out
from
possession
of
the
federal
government,
he's
got
to
do
two
things,
he
has
to
pay
the
--
the
import
tax,
the
tariff.
he
also
must
pay
the
internal
revenue
tax.
now,
once
those
taxes
are
paid,
then
they,
probably,
becomes
subject
to
taxation.
mr.
millard
cox
that's
right.
mr.
millard
cox
none
whatever,
your
honor.
and
now,
there
are
three
--
there
are
three
--
mr.
millard
cox
yes,
sir
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
millard
cox
yes.
that's
my
position.
and
--
mr.
millard
cox
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
millard
cox
it
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
millard
cox
i
say
--
mr.
millard
cox
i
say
that
kentucky
cannot
levy
a
tariff
on
--
on
liquor
coming
into
this
country
from
abroad.
mr.
millard
cox
yes.
now,
there
--
there
are
three
states
that
have
passed
on
this
question,
california,
kentucky
and
wisconsin.
and
they've
all
held
in
unanimous
opinions
against
their
own
department
of
revenues
who
sought
to
tax
whisky
under
the
same
circumstances
as
the
facts
in
the
beam
case.
in
addition
to
that,
the
editorial
writers
of
american
jurisprudence,
and
i
quote
that
on
page
23
of
my
brief,
have
this
to
say
about
the
matter,
i
have
to
study
all
the
cases
including
justice
black,
the
cases
that
you
referred
to,
"well,
as
a
general
rule,
the
regulation
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
is
a
matter
exclusively
of
federal
regulation.
the
federal
government
has,
by
the
twenty-first
amendment,
yielded
some
of
its
powers
with
reference
to
intoxicating
liquors.
the
twenty-first
amendment
circumscribes
the
power
of
congress
by
prohibiting
the
transportation
or
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
into
any
state
or
territory
for
delivery
or
use
in
violation
of
the
local
law.
but
it
does
not
deprive
the
congress
of
authority
to
control
the
importation
of
liquors
into
the
united
states.
moreover,
congress
possesses
the
power
to
levy
import
duties
on
intoxicating
liquors
imported
in
foreign
trade
or
commerce.
and
the
several
states,
without
the
consent
of
congress,
are
forbidden
to
lay
duties
on
imports
other
than
as
maybe
necessary
for
executing
their
inspection
laws."
now,
that's
the
--
the
editorial
writers
of
american
jurisprudence,
cited
on
page
23
of
my
brief.
mr.
millard
cox
justice
black,
i
don't
have
that
quote,
a
quotation
from
those
pages
here
but
everyone
of
--
that
i
cited
has
been
--
that
had
been
--
that
come
before
this
court.
mr.
millard
cox
now,
i
--
it
may
--
i
don't
know
that
this
comment
is
necessary,
it's
never
been
contented
by
kentucky
that
this
was
an
inspection
law,
it's
a
revenue
measure.
we
know
that
under
the
import-export
clause,
a
state
has
the
right
to
--
to
impose
reasonable
regulation
for
--
to
protect
the
state
from
diversion
of
alcoholic
beverages
to
illegal
channels.
but
as
i
have
pointed
out,
kentucky's
got
the
--
the
transportation
permit,
there's
been
no
objection
to
that
on
the
part
of
the
state
nor
the
part
of
the
distillers.
and
--
i
think
up
to
the
case,
this
--
this
question
has
been
so
carefully
reviewed
by
three
state
courts.
it's
rather
coincidental
that
they
all
came
with
the
same
conclusion
deciding
against
their
own
revenue
department
that
that
passage
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
repeal
pro
tanto
the
import-export
clause
of
the
constitution.
