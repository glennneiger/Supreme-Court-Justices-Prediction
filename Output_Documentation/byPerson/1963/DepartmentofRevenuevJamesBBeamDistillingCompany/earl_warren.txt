beam
distilling
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
riley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
in
bond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
liquor
leaves
the
private
bonding
warehouse
of
the
respondent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
leave
in
bond
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
kentucky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
whether
you
can
levy
a
tax
on
that
amount
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
then
are
we
dealing
here
only
with
that
which
will
be
--
be
transported
from
the
bonded
warehouse
in
bond
through
kentucky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
only
--
only
that
comes
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
difference
between
transporting
it
through
the
state
in
bonded
trucks
and
--
and
on
the
other
hand,
having
it
remain
in
bonded
warehouses
in
kentucky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
you
tax
it.
that's
the
question
we
got
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
if
--
if
it's
an
in
bond
going
from
--
from
new
york,
port
of
new
york
to
--
to
illinois,
passes
through
kentucky,
you
can
tax
it
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
while
it's
traveling
in
bond
through
--
through
kentucky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
question
how
this
liquor
is
disposed
of
after
it
is
in
the
warehouse
is
not
an
issue
here
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
jameson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
riley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
--
does
mr.
--
does
mr.
cox
concede
that
--
that
they
have
the
right
to
control
the
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
understood
--
i
understood
mr.
cox
to
say
that
the
state
of
kentucky
could
keep
even
imported
liquor
entirely
out
of
the
state
if
it
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
the
commerce
clause
because
the
twenty-first
amendment
had
given
the
states
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
in
liquor.
but
says
he,
it
did
not
confer
the
right
on
the
states
to
tax
liquor
that
was
in
its
original
packages
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
coming
from
other
places.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
he
says
it
is
in
regulation
this
taxation
that
we're
dealing
with
now,
is
that
the
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
in
the
act
that
has
to
do
with
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
--
they
did
supply
--
they
did
take
out
the
permit
and
he
says
there
is
no
objection
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
says
it's
a
tax
that
they
are
objecting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
that
10
cents
is
regulatory
as
well
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
much
of
it
is
regulatory,
because
i
am
telling
him
to
maintain
that
under
the
--
the
import-export
law.
you
can
only
exact
from
them
for
regulation
that
which
is
necessary
for
you
to
regulate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
then
that
you
could
--
you
could
levy
a
tax
high
enough
to
make
the
difference
between
the
differential
between
foreign
liquor
and
the
liquor
you
--
you
produce
in
kentucky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
even
though
it's
in
the
original
package.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
believe
that's
a
part
of
the
twenty-one
--
twenty-first
amendment.
