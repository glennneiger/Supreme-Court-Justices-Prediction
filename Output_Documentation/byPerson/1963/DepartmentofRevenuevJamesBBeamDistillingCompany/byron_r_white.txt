the
end
result
of
this,
i
suppose,
is
that
all
of
the
states
in
the
united
states
passed
a
law
there
--
that
they're
--
no
one
may
have
possession
or
sell
any
imported
liquors
within
the
borders
of
the
state
that
you
would
say
that
each
state
could
do
that
and
the
fact
was
all
over
and
there
are
being
no
foreign
liquors
whatsoever
in
the
united
states,
that's
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
the
(inaudible)
the
import
clause
anyway
because
this
liquor
remained
in
its
original
packages.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
would
have
--
would
you
have
any
objection
to
this
tax
if
this
whisky,
while
it
was
in
bonded
warehouse,
was
repackaged
and
then
kentucky
put
this
tax
upon
all
the
whiskies
that
were
sold
out
of
that
warehouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i'm
not
--
if
all
--
all
that
happen
was
that
it
was
taken
out
of
one
package
and
put
in
another,
remained
in
the
bonded
warehouse
and
all
the
sales
were
for
delivery
outside
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
my
example,
it
wasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
remember
--
even
though
it's
been
--
it's
changed
packages,
it's
still
in
bond
and
there
is
no
chance
for
diversion
within
the
state,
let's
just
assume
that.
and
that
all
they're
doing
is
repackaging
within
the
state
and
movement
out
of
the
state
in
the
bond.
now,
--
apparently
under
the
rules
that
has
been
established,
the
import
clause
would
no
longer
be
of
any
significance,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
--
i'm
asking,
i'm
not
suggesting.
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
relying
solely
on
the
import
clause,
then
if
that
--
and
if
the
clause
is
--
is
lifted
or
is
not
applicable,
where
the
original
packages
have
been
changed,
then
you
--
you
have
no
other
argument
other
than
the
import
clause,
doesn't
it?
