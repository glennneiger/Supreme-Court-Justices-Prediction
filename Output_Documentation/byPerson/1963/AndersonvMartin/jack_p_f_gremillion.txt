mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
honorable
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court,
i'm
here
representing
the
louisiana
secretary
of
state
who
is
charged
under
this
particular
act
with
preparing
the
ballots.
and
as
a
chief
election
officer
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
all
of
the
ballots
are
prepared
by
him.
then
they
go
to
the
printer.
and
then
they
are
placed
on
the
voting
machines.
now,
we
have
voting
machines
in
every
precinct
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
we
have
had
for
about
--
had
for
about
10
years
now.
they
proved
very
effective
and
very
beneficial
on
the
ballot
which
is
prepared
by
the
secretary
of
state,
are
three
things,
the
man
--
the
candidate's
name,
his
race
and
at
first,
when
it
--
legislature
first
prepared
ballots
who
instructed
the
secretary
of
state
to
prepare
these
ballots,
we
found
that
we
had
a
lot
of
illiterate
people
in
louisiana.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
were
registered
to
vote
who
couldn't
read
and
write.
and
so
later
on,
they
put
the
number
on
the
voting
machine.
so,
we
have
three
things
that
appear
on
the
ballot,
a
number,
a
name
and
a
race
and
that
is
all
that
is
on
the
voting
machine
other
than
the
instruction
that
you
got
to
push
this
button
and
switch
this
switch
and
so
forth.
now,
we
have
in
a
democratic
primary
--
well,
a
republican
primary,
too,
but
there's
very
few
republicans
in
louisiana,
i
apologize
for
that.
but
we're
having
a
primary
election
on
december
the
7th
in
louisiana.
and
of
course,
i
am
a
candidate
for
a
reelection.
and
i
reemphasize
that
in
my
case,
number
20
is
my
ballot
number,
my
race
and
my
name
and
that's
all
that
appears
on
the
ballot.
now,
that
information,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
is
given
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
a
form
of
a
qualification
paper
that
the
candidate
himself
must
fill
out.
on
that
qualification
paper,
approximately
six
things,
he
signs
an
affidavit.
he
says
that
i'm
a
qualified
voter,
that
i
possess
all
the
qualifications
under
louisiana
law,
that
i'm
a
registered
voter
in
a
certain
ward,
in
a
certain
precinct.
he
says,
"i
herewith
pay
the
fee
which
is
required
by
the
committee
involved.
he
also
says
that
i
am
not
a
dummy
candidate.
he
also
says
that
i
am
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
under
the
appropriate
section
of
louisiana
law.
and
he
also
says
that
i
am
a
member
of
blank
and
that
candidate
fills
in
his
race
and
it
is
from
that
qualification
paper
that
the
committee
passes
on
the
--
and
accepts
and
they're
given
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
from
there,
he
prepares
the
ballot.
i
give
you
that
information
so
you
can
understand
the
--
the
louisiana
legal
machinery
on
just
how
the
ballot
is
prepared.
the
question
in
this
case,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
i
hope
the
court,
is
really
a
simple
one.
it
comes
down
to
this.
can
a
state
require
information
on
a
ballot,
such
as
race,
for
the
purpose
of
informing
the
electorate?
can
it
do
that
when
it
treats
all
of
the
candidates
alike?
now,
is
that
unconstitutional?
does
it
violate
any
section
of
the
united
states
constitution?
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
is
involved
here
because
there's
no
freedom
of
speech
being
denied
to
anyone.
i
don't
think
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
involved
here
because
no
one
is
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
the
only
thing
that
we
are
concerned
with
and
can
be
concerned
with
as
a
result
of
this
complaint
is
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
state
is,
of
course,
charged
with
the
qualification
of
voters.
it
can
pass
laws
regulating
voting.
it
can
pass
laws
regulating
qualified.
it's
within
its
own
spill
when
it
does
that.
and
it
commits
no
offense
to
anyone
or
to
the
federal
constitution
as
long
as
those
laws
treat
all
alike
and
there
is
no
discrimination.
now,
there's
no
discrimination
in
this
statute.
we're
not
involved
with
a
segregation
case
here.
we're
not
involved
with
any
reprisals
in
this
matter.
we're
not
involved
with
the
interest
of
an
individual
ballot
as
against
the
--
the
interest
of
the
state.
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
or
says
in
the
law
that
a
candidate
has
got
to
have
--
has
got
to
have
complete
anonymity
when
he
places
his
name
on
the
ballot
box.
the
state
does
not
go
into
the
election
box
and
vote.
it's
done
entirely
secret.
and
the
right
to
vote
is
a
cherished
privilege
and
should
be
enjoyed
by
everyone.
but
we
must
remember
and
we
must
appreciate
that
when
a
person
goes
into
the
ballot
box
and
votes,
he
has
the
privilege
of
discriminating.
he
can
vote
against
the
candidate
because
of
his
race.
he
can
vote
against
him
because
he
doesn't
like
a
number.
he
can
vote
against
him
because
he
don't
like
the
way
he
talks
or
walks
or
he
can
vote
against
him
because
he's
--
it
is
the
incumbent,
there's
a
lot
of
people
that
work
with
everybody
on
the
office.
i
hope
that's
not
true
on
december
the
7th
of
course.
but
when
a
man
goes
into
--
a
lady
goes
into
the
voting
booth,
if
there's
none
running
for
office,
he
necessarily
must
vote
for
one.
when
he
does
that,
he
actually
discriminates
against
the
other
eight.
so
that
is
a
privilege
of
voting.
that
is
one
of
the
cherished
principles
of
voting.
so
i
reemphasize
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
if
the
state
would
pass
a
law
attempting
to
exercise
prejudices,
it's
my
opinion,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
would
be
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
purely
to
let
people
know
who
they
are
voting
for.
now,
we
had
a
--
a
governor
in
1940
by
the
name
of
sam
jones
who
ran
for
office.
now,
can
you
imagine
how
many
sam
jones
is
of
the
different
races
there
are
in
the
state
of
louisiana?
suppose
that
ike
smith
wanted
to
run
for
office,
how
many
would
we
have?
that's
the
only
question
involved
purely
having
an
informed
electorate
and
that
is
absolutely
all.
we
have
some
61
negroes
running
for
office
in
louisiana
in
the
primary
coming
up
on
december
the
7th.
we
even
had,
in
one
parish
and
it
may
be
interesting
to
note,
we
had
one
justice
apiece
and
a
constable
who
were
negroes,
who
qualified
and
it
didn't
even
have
any
opposition
and
they're
going
back
into
office
without
any
opposition.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
and
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
they
would
be
doing
offense
to
the
first
amendment
if
they
did
so.
now,
of
course,
the
government
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
points
out
that
if
a
state
want
to
aid
the
voters
that
it
could
publish
a
biographical
sketch
which,
of
course,
would
show
you
a
religious
affiliation,
your
clubs
that
you
belong
to,
where
you
live
and
what
your
college
education
or
your
high
school
education
would
be.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government's
position,
i
--
i
think
that
if
they
say
that's
alright,
then
their
brief
is
completely
in
our
favor
and
should
be
treated
that
way
because
i
personally
think,
in
all
sincerity,
that
if
the
state
did
that,
as
the
government
want
--
would
have
us
do,
then
we
would
definitely
be
aiding
candidates
and
we
will
be
practicing
discrimination
and
we
would
be
fostering
prejudices.
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
and
i
think
that
that
would
definitely
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
this
case
should
not
be
embellished
with
platonic
ideas,
this
is
strictly
a
legal
question.
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
court
of
law.
and
the
question
here
and
sole
question
here
is
can
a
state
pass
such
a
regulation
without
doing
offense
to
the
federal
constitution?
many
states,
as
also
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
require
you
to
say
where
your
residence
is.
and
in
massachusetts,
they
want
you
to
know
whether
you're
an
incumbent
or
not.
well,
if
--
if
that's
--and
those
--
those
who've
never
charged,
i
see
no
difference
between
stating
what
your
race
is
and
stating
that
you
live
at
such
and
such
an
address.
because
it's
--
many
of
the
voters,
for
instance,
in
louisiana
if
you'd
have
one
of
the
candidates
here
before
they
finish,
rather
mr.
belton,
whom
i
know
real
well,
i
know
where
he
lives,
he
lives
in
scotlandville
which
is
a
very
heavily
populated
negro
community
near
southern
university
and
if
he
would
put
his
residence
down
there,
everyone
would
know
his
race.
i'm
saying
if
we
didn't
have
race
against
and
it
had
residence
the
way
the
other
states
did.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now
--
now
if
the
state
would've
done
as
in
the
mcdonald
case,
where
it
selected
one
particular
race,
i
think
that
that
mcdonald
decision
is
correct.
i
agree
with
it
that
it's
completely
in
--
in
apposite
here
because
the
facts
in
this
case
are
entirely
different.
but
i
do
not
think
so
because
you
are
giving
the
voter
information
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
--
and
the
state
is
in
no
way
taking
part
in
that
election.
no
more
than
it
is
by
providing
the
--
the
number.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
--
i
don't
of
course
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
if
--
if
--
if
you
say
that
that
is
correct,
well,
then
i'm
out
of
court,
of
course.
and
that's
the
question
that
we
are
here
to
decide.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
as
long
as
the
state
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
am
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
correct.
the
voters
are
entitled
to
this
information
because
he
is
entitled
to
know
the
identity
of
the
candidate
and
who
he's
voting
for.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that's
the
justification
for
it.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
on
--
on
the
basis
of
race
because
certainly,
all
people
have
to
be
of
some
different
race.
and
they
certainly
should
be
proud
of
it.
and
that
--
i
don't
see
where
that's
doing
any
--
any
offense
fostering
prejudices
of
any
nature
or
kind.
the
question
was
asked
here
yesterday,
what
about
sex?
i
think
that
a
state
could
require
sex.
we
have
several
ladies
running
for
office
in
louisiana
today.
they
are
--
they
are
listed
as
mrs.
so
and
so.
but
we
don't
require
sex
because
people
generally
know
that
if
your
name
is
lillian,
you're
certainly
going
to
be
a
female.
i
will
admit
that
there
are
some
coincidences
where
their
names
have
similarity
but
they
are
so
minute
that
it
--
it
would
be
probably
one
of
no
consequence
whatsoever.
now,
when
this
law
was
passed
in
1960,
saying
that
the
race
had
to
be
spelled
out
by
the
candidate
and
put
on
the
ballot,
there
was
considerable
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
photograph
should
be
put
on
the
ballot,
as
justice
harlan
asked
yesterday.
now,
suppose
--
it
was
determined,
however,
that
a
photograph
would
be
too
cumbersome.
and
i
suppose
that
the
candidates
for
office
or
the
members
of
the
legislature
probably
had
themselves
in
mind
and
they
said,
"no,
we're
not
going
to
fool
with
photographs
if
we
just
put
race
on
the
ballot
and
that
would
sufficient
identity."
now,
the
--
the
whole
question
here,
as
i
repeat,
is
not
a
question
of
morals,
it's
not
a
question
of
policy,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
wrong
risk
legislation
or
right
legislation,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
as
long
as
all
candidates
are
treated
alike,
a
state
may
require
a
designation
of
race
on
the
ballot.
now
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
don't
think
we
have
a
statute
as
such.
but
as
you
well
know
in
this
court,
well
knows
that
that
has
been
the
policy.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
struck
down
quite
a
few
of
our
statutes
and
i'm
sure
that
you
probably
strike
down
some
more.
we've
had
as
to
more
file
recently
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
justice
douglas
went
into
that
quite
thoroughly
in
one
of
the
cases,
i
think
(inaudible)
cases
something
like
that.
i
don't
know
which
one
it
was.
but
i
come
back
to
the
same
question
that
it
--
it's
immaterial.
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here
is
inform
its
electorate
and
that
is
the
legal
question
that
is
before
us.
none
of
us
can
change
our
race.
i'm
sure
as
i've
said
before
that
all
of
us
are
proud
of
it.
every
time
we've
had
a
case
involving
segregation,
the
complainants
have
always
identified
them
or
complained
of
a
wrong
was
done.
they've
identified
themselves
as
negroes.
and
i
think
that
this
court
not
to
come
up
and
say
that
it's
wrong
to
identify
a
candidate
on
a
ballot
would
have
the
reverse
effect
of
putting
a
stigma
on
a
particular
race,
which
i
don't
think
it
would
be
proper
to
do.
now,
of
course,
opposing
counsel
said
that
we
had
all
kind
of
laws
passed
to
this
particular
session
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
we're
only
involved
here
with
one
particular
statute.
and
the
question,
as
i
repeat,
is
whether
or
not
a
state
can
legally
provide
this
information
to
the
voter.
now,
it
maybe
that
you
might
be
constrained
to
say
that
the
state
would
be
discriminating
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
large,
large
number
of
negroes
in
our
state,
but
that
isn't
the
controlling
point,
gentlemen.
and
justice,
i
believe
justice
stewart
asked
yesterday,
"would
this
law
be
legal
in
south
dakota
where
there
are
very,
very
few?"
i
certainly
think
it
would
be
legal
in
south
dakota.
it
would
be
legal
in
south
dakota.
it
would
be
just
as
legal
in
louisiana.
in
other
words,
the
number
of
people
or
the
number
of
the
races
is
not
the
question.
we
have
very
few
chinamen
or
mongols
in
louisiana
but
--
and
--
and
that
they've
had
several
of
them
run
for
office
and
they've
had
to
state
their
race.
is
this
proper,
a
proper
exercise
of
state
government,
as
long
as
everyone
is
treated
alike?
i
emphasize
that
in
this
particular
law,
all
of
the
candidates
are
treated
alike.
there
is
no
discrimination
according
to
race.
and
i
humbly
ask
you
to
sustain
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
sir?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
how
is
that
judge
--
justice,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
whatever
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
what
--
whatever
--
whatever
the
candidate
would
put
down
if
you
had
--
if
you
had,
let's
--
let's
say
there's
caucasians,
i
think
in
the
three
general
breakdowns
as
caucasians,
as
negroids
and
there's
mongoloids.
but
of
course,
there
are
other
races
within
those
races
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
have
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
have
--
how
is
that
judge?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i've
seen
chinaman.
we
had
a
chinaman
running
in
louisiana
and
he
put
down
mongol.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
don't
use
the
name
of
"white".
we
use
the
name
of
"caucasians".
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
so
that
that
would
take
care
of
the
irish,
the
frenchman,
jewish
and
so
forth.
we
--
we
don't
use
the
name
of
"white"
at
all,
it's
caucasian.
caucasian,
negro,
mongol.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
if
it
got
--
if
got
by
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
if
got
by
this
committee,
it
would
certainly
get
on
the
ballot
and
that
--
the
committee
or
the
republican
committee
or
the
democratic
committee
could
challenge
it
or
someone
could
challenge
it.
do
you
understand?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
didn't
go
in
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
there
is
no
punishment.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
there's
no
punishment,
mr.
justice.
but
i
didn't
go
into
all
of
the
details
of
qualifying,
i
just
stated
those
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
generally.
now,
let
me
--
after
a
candidate
fills
out
his
qualification
papers
and
he
states
his
race,
those
qualifying
papers,
as
i
stated,
go
back
to
the
committee.
the
committee
reviews
them.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
--
well,
in
this
case,
the
democratic
committee
reviews
them.
you
see,
the
democratic
committee,
the
party
committee,
sends
the
names
to
the
secretary
of
state.
that's
where
the
secretary
of
state
gets
them
from.
now,
there
is
a
provision
in
louisiana
law
that
provides
that
any
candidate,
who
has
filed
qualification
papers,
can
be
challenged
before
the
committee
and
the
whole
committee
can
meet
and
hear
that
particular
challenge.
suppose
that
--
say
in
the
case
of
attorney
general
adopt
to
try
to
qualify
and
someone
found
it
out
and
he
--
he
has,
i
think,
48
hours
within
which
to
challenge,
he's
got
to
send
his
protest
in
a
form
of
a
registered
letter.
the
committee's
got
to
meet
within
48
hours
and
render
this
decision
within
24.
but
if
a
doctor
say
would
try
to
run
for
attorney
general
because
our
constitution
says
you
got
to
be
a
lawyer
with
so
many
years
of
service.
if
the
committee
said,
"well,
we're
not
going
to
accept
your
qualification
papers
because
you're
not
qualified",
well
then,
the
only
thing
would
happen,
there'd
be
no
reprisal,
there'd
be
no
punishment,
there's
no
crime
committed.
the
only
thing
would
happen
was
the
committee
would
fail
to
certify
him
to
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
absolutely
not.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
he's
not.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
if
a
negro
wrote
down
caucasian
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
it
could
possibly
go
through
the
committee
and
be
printed
on
the
ballot
that
way.
there'd
be
nothing
to
stop
that
unless
someone
challenged
it
or
the
committee
found
it
out
itself.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
he
has
to
have
his
address
on
the
qualification
papers
too,
of
certain
wards,
the
precinct,
you
see
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
he
would
have
to
state
one
of
the
three
--
one
of
the
--
the
three
branches,
caucasian,
negro
or
mongol.
now,
he
wouldn't
--
now
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
suppose
that
he
would
be
classified
as
a
mongoloid
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
indians
have
mongoloid
traces
and
they
are
classified,
as
i
understand
it,
ethnically
as
mongoloids.
and
we
do
have
some
indians
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
we
have
quite
a
few.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
a
school
down
in
--
and
i'm
not
trying
to
get
into
brown
versus
topeka
but
i
do
want
to
tell
you
this.
we
have
a
indian
tribe
down
in
homer,
louisiana
near
the
gulf.
they
maintained
their
own
school
which
is
state-supported
which
is
completely
segregated
and
they
won't
let
anybody
come
in
that
school
regardless
of
whether
they're
caucasians,
as
negroes,
they
want
it
for
themselves.
and
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
the
indian
is
the
true
original
american,
but
they
have
certainly
been
discriminated
against
an
awful,
awful
lot.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
sir?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
no,
no,
we
--
we
don't
--
it's
a
matter
of
choice
so
far
as
they
are
concerned.
well,
i've
certainly
enjoyed
my
discussion
which
you
--
with
you
gentlemen
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
may
i
say
one
thing?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
one
--
may
i
say
one
more
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
let
me
say
this.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
there
could
be
no
punishment
for
perjury
in
this
particular
instance,
but
even
though
it
is
required
to
be
under
oath,
because
perjury
in
louisiana
can
only
be
committed
before
a
court
of
record
or
before
a
grand
jury
so
there
would
be
no
perjury
whatsoever.
there
would
be
no
punishment
for
filling
out
this
form
erroneously,
none
whatsoever.
and
there's
no
dispute
about
the
facts
in
this
case
and
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
form
that
was
used.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
form
was
in
the
record
was
it
mr.
greenberg?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it
was
not
in
the
record.
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i'm
sure
that
opposing
counsel
didn't
mean
to
give
the
court
the
idea
that
he
could
be
punished
for
perjury
because
perjury
can
only
be
committed
in
a
court
of
record.
a
witness
has
taken
an
oath,
testifying
either
before
a
grand
jury
or
in
a
court
of
records
so
there
can
be
no
punishment
for
an
erroneous
filling
out
of
that
application.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
we
do
have
a
false
swearing
statute.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
could
--
i
can't
answer
you
whether
that
would
constitute
false
swearing
or
not
because
i
don't
remember
the
details
of
the
false
swearing
statute.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
perjury
is
a
capital
offence
in
louisiana.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
--
i
don't
mean
but
punishment
at
hard
labor
not
capital
as
a
felony
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
that
was
what
i
meant
to
say.
and
false
swearing
is
a
misdemeanor.
but
we've
never
had
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
would
your
honor
care
for
me
to
give
that
to
you
in
the
form
of
a
letter
or
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
alright.
we'll
certainly
do
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
statute
that
says
what
a
negro
is
specifically.
we
have
no
statute
that
specifically
says
what
a
caucasian
is.
we've
had
several
court
decisions
that
have
defined
a
negro.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
those
court
decisions
are
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
--
i
mean
the
complainants'
brief
at
page
14.
it
says,
"neither
the
statute
challenged
in
this
case
by
any
other
louisiana
statute
defines
the
term
"negro"
or
any
similar
to
it."
in
this
case,
citing
here
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
defined
the
word
"color"
as
a
term
specifically
applied
in
the
united
states
to
negroes
or
persons
having
an
admixture
of
negro
blood.
the
same
word
is
often
applied
to
black
people,
africans
or
that
(inaudible)
mixed
or
unmixed
and
to
persons
who
have
any
appreciable
mixture
of
african
blood.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
yes.
