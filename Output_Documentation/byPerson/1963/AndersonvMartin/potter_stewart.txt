under
what
circum
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
our
whole
constitutional
concept
is
based
upon
the
assumption
of
an
informed
electorate
and
i
suppose
you
would
not
disagree
with
that,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
missed
what
you
just
said
mr.
greenberg.
what
requires
a
higher
standard
of
proof?
justice

stewart
as

stewart
no,
i
don't
understand.
i
--
i
wanted

as
--
as
you
explained
it
to
us
in
argument,
you
said
that
the
blank
that
the
candidate
draws
in
is
controlling
it
and
that
goes
on
the
ballot
and
i
wondered
what,
if
any,
sanctions
or
penalties
or
punishments

justice
potter
stewart
--
in
other
words,
to
prevent
him
from

committee
is
this?

potter
stewart
couldn't
it
happen
in

nothing
here
that
says
that
a
negro
is
not
qualified
to
be
a
candidate,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
what
would
