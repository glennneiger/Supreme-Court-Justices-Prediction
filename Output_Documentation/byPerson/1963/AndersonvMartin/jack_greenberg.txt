mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
which
denied
preliminary
and
permanent
injunctions
sought
by
the
appellants.
this
was
a
statutory
three-judge
court
because
the
appellants
sought
an
injunction
against
state
officers
seeking
to
enjoin
them
from
enforcing
a
state
statute.
the
opinion
below
--
the
decision
below
was
2-to-1.
the
majority
opinion
by
judges
west
and
ellis
voting
for
denial
of
the
injunction
and
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
john
minor
wisdom
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
for
granting
the
injunction.
judge
wisdom
also
dissented
on
the
denial
of
the
permanent
injunction.
the
statute
which
the
appellants
sought
to
enjoin
is
louisiana
revised
statutes
section
18-1174.1,
which
was
enacted
in
1960
along
with
35
other
laws
bearing
on
interracial
relations
which
are
set
forth
and
discussed
in
a
law
review
article
in
the
louisiana
law
review
by
professor
wollett.
and
this
statute
essentially
requires
that
in
every
application
or
notification
for
candidacy
in
state
or
local
elections
or
any
certification
of
a
candidate
for
office
and
on
the
ballot,
the
race
of
the
candidate
be
set
forth,
whatever
that
race
may
be.
and
the
race
must
be
set
forth
in
type
the
same
size
as
the
type
of
a
candidate's
name.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
at
all
in
dispute,
they
are
derived
from
the
complaint
and
the
answer
in
a
brief
stipulation,
all
of
which
appear
in
the
record.
the
majority
opinion
rests
on
two
principle
grounds.
first,
appears
on
page
32
of
the
record
and
that
is
that
negro
candidates
were
treated
on
the
same
basis
as
white
candidates
that
is,
all
candidates
had
to
set
forth
their
race
following
their
name
on
the
ballot.
and
in
so
holding,
the
majority
below
distinguished
the
case
from
the
only
other
case
that
deals
with
such
a
statute.
in
mcdonald
against
key,
a
tenth
circuit
decision
and
the
court
held
that
in
mcdonald
against
key,
it
was
required
only
that
negro
candidates
state
their
race
following
their
name
on
the
ballot
whereas
in
this
case,
all
candidates
are
required
to
do
so.
and
then
secondly,
on
page
31
of
the
record
and
also
elsewhere
in
the
opinion,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
disposed
to
create
a
shield
against
the
brightest
light
of
public
examination
of
candidates
for
public
office.
now,
the
appellants
submit
that
the
majority
below
was
wrong
and
that
judge
wisdom
was
right
and
that
judge
wisdom
was
right
for
the
very
reasons
that
he
set
forth
in
the
first
two
brief
paragraphs
of
his
opinion
which
appear
on
page
34
of
the
record,
i
think
adequately
summarized
his
position.
that
is
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
constitution,
a
man
is
a
man,
he
is
not
a
white
man,
he's
not
an
indian,
he's
not
a
negro.
if
private
persons
identify
a
candidate
for
public
office
as
a
negro,
they
have
a
right
to
do
so
but
it
is
no
part
of
the
business
of
the
state
to
put
a
racial
stamp
on
the
ballot.
it
is
too
close
to
a
religious
stand
that
has
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
electoral
processes.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
reasonable
relationship
that
would
have
to
a
qualification
for
office.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
deals
with
questions
of
sex
or
questions
of
--
of
the
classic
case
of
whether
one
is
a
redhead
and
so
forth
in
the
same
way
it
deals
with
questions
of
race.
race
is,
i
think,
narrow,
well-established
to
be
an
impermissible
standard
for
government
action.
in
fact,
that's
just
the
point
we're
getting
to
as
the
principal
reason
why
we
would
urge
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
the
only
reason
why
this
possibly
could
be
put
on
the
ballot.
in
fact,
the
only
conceivable
reason
is
so
that
people
go
into
the
polling
booth
can
act
upon
it
so
that
they
can
make
a
racial
determination
or
discrimination.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
i
think
it's
a
relevant
fact?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
--
it
possibly
might
be.
i
--
at
the
moment,
i
can't
think
of
why
it
must
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
i
think
its
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
i
think
it
might
be
relevant
to
put
the
sex
of
a
candidate
on
the
ballot.
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
race
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
under
some
circumstances,
it
might
be.
i
--
i
imagine
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
it
would
make
a
difference
if
a
candidate
was
so
terribly
old
that
he
could
not
carry
out
the
--
the
obligations
of
his
office.
i'm
--
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
but
again,
i
think
all
these
various
standards
that
possibly
might
be
reasonable
or
rather
different
than
race
which
i
believe
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
point
that
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
is
that
the
only
reason
the
race
is
put
upon
the
ballot
is
presumably
so
that
the
voter
can
act
upon
it
and
while
voters
may
make
racial
discriminations
in
candidates
to
whom
they
vote
and
while
we
may
think
that's
unfortunate,
there's
really
nothing
that
can
be
done
about
it.
but
that
the
state
as
in
the
alabama
case,
naacp
versus
alabama,
the
state
has
no
business
in
participating
in
this
determination
in
playing
a
part
in
it
just
as
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion,
i
believe
it
was
held
that
while
members
of
the
general
public
might
discriminate
against
members
of
the
association,
certainly
the
state
had
no
business
in
exposing
them
or
in
facilitating
this
discrimination
or
encouraging
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
feel
that
the
state
has
no
business
in
intruding
itself
into
this
process.
that
was
in
--
barrows
against
jackson,
it
was
held
the
state
has
no
business
in
encouraging
racial
discrimination,
that
this
is
a
facilitation
of
it
that
it
makes
it
--
it
makes
it
simpler
and
it's
something
that
makes
it
possible.
the
state
doesn't
have
something
--
no
business
and
no
--
no
business
doing
it.
and
moreover,
this
facilitation
of
making
a
racial
distinction
has
to
be
seen
in
a
context
of
louisiana
law.
there
are
great
body
of
statutes
in
louisiana
requiring
racial
segregation
and
racial
distinction.
this
very
statute
was
enacted
as
1
of
35
in
the
1960
legislature
for
that
great
purpose
of
the
state's
public
policy
and
described
as
such
as
it
appears
in
the
resolution
set
forth
on
page
11
of
our
brief
where
louisiana
has
always
maintained
the
policy
of
segregation
of
the
races,
aware
that
the
intention
of
the
citizens
of
this
sovereign
state
that
such
a
policy
be
continued.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
first,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
i
would
look
to
that
as
not
the
same
thing
particularly
in
a
state
such
as
louisiana
where
there's
a
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
who
is
a
negro
and
who
is
a
white
person.
a
great
deal
of
louisiana
litigation
on
this
reported
cases
we
deferred
to.
i
would
say
that
in
the
abstract
that
might
be
alright,
if
we
were
to
follow
a
stat
--
if
we're
to
follow
a
statute
such
as
this,
i
think
it
would
obviously
be
intended
to
achieve
the
same
result
and
not
perform
the
same
basis.
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
it
isn't
in
the
case
here,
one
of
the
reasons
we
have
this
statute
is
because
it
isn't
the
case
here,
because
we
have
this
great
body
of
case
law
in
louisiana
as
to
who
is
a
negro
and
who
is
a
white
person.
it
--
it
is
the
obvious
premise
of
louisiana
law
that
negroes
are
inferior
to
white
people.
it
is
a
defamation
in
the
state
of
louisiana
to
call
a
white
man
a
negro
and
it's
actionable
no
matter
how
slight
the
injury,
how
innocent
the
mistake
in
cases
set
forth
demonstrating
that.
to
call
--
to
call
one,
they
would
--
to
denominate
one,
a
negro
under
louisiana
law
calls
for
a
higher
standard
of
proof
than
its
necessary
to
convict
one
of
crime.
in
other
words,
a
higher
standard
of
proof
and
is
necessary
to
send
somebody
to
the
electric
chair
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
there
is
an
issue
as
in
some
of
the
cases
we
have
cited
here
as
to
whether
one
is
colored
or
white,
as
in
the
--
the
adjudication
whether
a
death
certificate
is
correct
which
is
the
particular
case
that
we
have
cited.
the
louisiana
courts
have
held
that
a
far
higher
standard
of
proof
is
necessary
in
this
--
i
just
for
a
moment,
like
to
read
the
--
the
language
that
they
used.
that
whereas
in
a
criminal
case,
one
must
be
convicted
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
in
a
case
involving
status
of
the
race,
it
has
to
be
established
"beyond
any
doubt".
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
one
is
a
negro.
mr.
jack
greenberg
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
in
this
--
the
particular
case
that
i
have
in
mind
is
cited
in
the
brief
on
page
13.
there's
a
number
of
cases
set
forth
in
the
footnote.
this
case
is
state
ex
rel.
rodi
versus
city
of
new
orleans.
and
the
question
was
whether
a
--
the
state
registrar
of
vital
statistics
had
improperly
changed
the
death
certificate
from
white
to
negro.
and
the
family
brought
an
action
to
establish
that
the
deceased
was
really
white
and
not
colored
and
the
courts
held
that
he
was
indeed
colored
and
that
the
registrar
of
vital
statistics
had
not
made
an
error
and
they
said
that
this
was
established
"beyond
any
doubt"
but
if
it
had
been
established
on
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
wouldn't
have
been
good
enough.
and
we
submit
that
in
a
--
in
a
state
where
race
is
treated
in
this
way,
where
negroes
are
treated
in
such
a
way
in
terms
of
the
segregation
laws
and
the
resolution
of
the
state
and
so
forth
to
require
someone
to
put
his
race
on
the
ballot.
and
to
state
whether
he's
colored
or
white
is
an
invitation
to
the
public
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
way
the
state
is
encouraging
it
to
act
with
the
law
of
defamation,
the
law
of
racial
status,
the
segregation
laws
and
so
forth
throughout
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
think,
it
would
--
it
--
it
would
be
equally
bad
in
--
in
any
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
point
of
this
argument
is
really
an
a
fortiori
argument
to
show
that
not
only
are
they
--
not
only
are
they
--
they
intruded
race
since
the
electoral
process
but
it's
not
a
neutral
decision
as
they're
claiming
it
is.
but
it's
a
--
it's
an
intrusion
into
the
electoral
process
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
the
public
policy
of
the
state
denominating
negroes
as
inferior.
in
fact,
as
north
dakota
doesn't
do
it
and
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
suggested
that
it
would
or
that
anyone
there
was
slightly
interested
in
it.
moreover,
we
--
we
submit
that
the
case
calls
for
the
application
of
the
rule
that
was
declared
in
bolling
against
sharpe,
the
district
of
columbia
school
segregation
case
which
reiterated
the
hirabayashi
and
korematsu
cases
that
classification
based
solely
only
upon
race
must
be
scrutinized
with
particular
care
since
it
is
contrary
to
our
traditions
and
hence,
constitutionally
suspect.
and
louisiana
has
offered
no
explanation
to
allay
the
suspicions.
the
only
reason
offered
by
the
state
and
the
court
below
is
that
this
will
inform
the
people
but
they
have
not
set
forth
any
reason
as
to
why
the
people
should
be
informed
as
to
race.
in
other
words,
they
have
just
restated
what
is
that
they
have
done.
and
so
we
would
submit
that
the
state
has
first
of
all
facilitated
and
encouraged
citizens
of
louisiana
to
make
a
racial
distinction
in
the
polling
booth
that
it
has
exerted
its
effort
--
exerted
a
great
deal
of
effort.
in
fact,
in
this
term
of
the
legislature
passed
35
laws
to
establish
what
that
discrimination
should
be.
and
that
it
is
offered
to
no
justification
except
for
the
fact
that
it
has
done
this
to
inform
the
people
as
to
why
it
has
passed
such
a
law
and
that
for
all
of
these
reasons,
the
statute
involved
is
unconstitutional
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
all
the
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
all
state
and
local
officers.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
these
were
candidates
i
neglected
to
state
for
the
school
board
in
their
particular
parish
each
one
in
a
separate
district.
mr.
jack
greenberg
please
the
court,
the
appellant
has
nothing
further
to
add
unless
the
court
had
some
questions.
i
do
have
this
qualifying
form
here
which
indicates
that
it
must
subscribed
to
under
oath
and
i
assume
the
sanction
would
be
perjury
if
someone
had
stated
that
he
was
member
of
some
race
and
it
was
held
he
was
not
a
member.
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
this,
i
can
hand
it
up
but
we
have
no
additional
argument
as
i've
stated
unless
the
court
have
some
questions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't
believe
it
was.
