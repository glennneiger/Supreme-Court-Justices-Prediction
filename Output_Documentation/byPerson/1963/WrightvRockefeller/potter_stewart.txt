excuse
me,
as
i
see
the
twentieth
there
is
a
gulf
behind
the
bronx
there
is
the
harlem
river?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
used
to
--
the
new
territories
today,
i
always
thought
the
harlem
river
was
the
boundary
of
new
york
county.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
per
se
you're
not
attacking
here.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
part
of
the
whole
picture.
justice
potter
stewart
those
disparities
in
numbers
per
se
you're
not
--
you're
--
you
would
say
--
you're
--
you're
not
claiming
or
wouldn't
otherwise
be
constitutionally
invalid
if
there
were
no
racial
limit.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
my
understanding.
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
my
(inaudible)
--
my
(inaudible)
if
it's
right
there
was
a
--
an
absolute
gain
in
numbers
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
negroes
and
non-whites
and
puerto
ricans.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
actually
the
number
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
did
increase
when
they
--
when
they
withdrew
the
boundaries.
justice
potter
stewart
out
in
the
southern
there,
there
you
get
into
mott
street
and
so
and
chinatown,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
instead
of
going
down
to
the
south
on
the
--
in
the
western
half
reading
vertically.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right
in
your
basic
hypothesis,
that
would
be
equally
unconstitutional,
wouldn't
it?
no
matter
how
beneficent
the
purpose
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
classification
based
on
race
and
race
alone?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
you
don't
say
it's
constitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
--
they
have
to
show
that
race,
i
don't
mean
i
show
by
evidence,
so
and
so
which
could
of
course
be
an
inference
of
circumstantial
evidence
but
didn't
they
have
to
show
that
under
your
view
that
race
was
the
only
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
under
their
view.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood,
as
i
understood
mr.
sandifer's
argument
is
--
it
was
this
that
that
if
it
were
shown
indisputably
or
by
proof
that
--
that
this
--
that
new
york
state
had
divided
its
congressional
districts
on
--
on
racial
--
on
racial
lines
and
he
--
and
he
disagreed
with
mr.
galt
to
think
that
that
was
unconstitutional
state
action,
but
he
further
went
on
to
say
first
that
he
didn't
think
there
was
any
proof
of
that
in
this
case
and
later
in
his
argument
he
pointed
out
that
there
is
in
fact
de
facto,
segregation
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
certainly
concentration
of
these
negro
and
puerto
rican
groups
in
harlem
as
all
the
world
knows.
certainly,
everybody
in
new
york
knows
that.
justice
potter
stewart
who's
the
candidate?
