mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
presentation,
we
shall
proceed
principally
along
two
lines.
first
and
this
in
a
great
degree
will
be
responsive
to
what
mr.
feldman
had
been
doing
and
saying
using
a
visual
method
as
well,
we
will
cover
some
of
the
principal
aspects
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
which
was
before
the
district
court
and
second,
we
will
go
to
the
legal
proposition.
the
question
of
the
legal
insufficiency
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
and
if
some
time
remains,
and
if
i
may,
that
second
argument
will
be
tied
in
if
the
responsibility
is
there
with
references
to
the
somewhat
related
subjects
of
justiciability
and
lack
of
equity.
i
think
it
might
be
well
if
i
were
to
proceed
first
your
honors
to
the
question
of
proof
and
the
burden
of
proof.
and
i
must
say
i
was
quite
intrigued
by
some
of
the
theories
of
burden
of
proof
that
were
expected
--
that
were
expounded
here
a
moment
ago
and
of
some
of
the
concepts
of
when
it
is
and
under
what
circumstances
the
state
must
proceed
with
proof
in
order
to
defend
what
we
will
show
in
this
perfectly
common
place,
redistricting;
something
which
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment,
raises
no
suspicion
of
unconstitutionality
whatsoever.
but
first,
in
order
to
address
myself
to
that
issue,
i
would
like
to
dispel,
if
i
can,
two
notions
which
have
been
fomented
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
your
honors
undoubtedly
in
the
course
of
mr.
feldman's
arguments
that
it
was
unclear
to
say
the
least
just
what
the
theory
of
appellant's
proof
and
burden
of
proof
might
be.
but
as
we
--
best
we've
been
able
to
gather
it
from
a
reading
of
the
briefs
and
from
listening
to
mr.
feldman
a
few
moments
ago,
it
ranges
all
the
way
from
doing
nothing
at
all
but
making
a
statistical
showing
of
disparity
to,
if
i
may
recall,
mr.
feldman's
phrase,
"twisting
the
legislature,
twisting
and
turning
deliberately
to
create
on
the
one
hand
as
lily
white
a
district
as
possible
and
on
the
other
hand,
as
thoroughly
saturated
the
negro
and
puerto
rican
district
as
possible."
so
i
presume
that
first,
i
must
dispose
if
i
can
of
the
argument
that
even
unintentional
segregation
is
constitutionally
prohibited
in
--
in
a
congressional
districting
situation
of
this
kind
and
for
that
reason
that
i
mere
showing
of
considerable
disparity
and
of
course
we're
assuming
arguendo
for
the
purpose
of
the
discussion
of
the
fact
and
the
proof.
we're
assuming
arguendo
under
this
section
of
our
argument
that
they
have
stated
a
colorable
claim
under
the
constitution.
but
they
--
they
feel
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
show
this
mere
disparity
in
ethnic
composition
and
that
will
be
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
state
and
there
are
many,
many
reasons
why
this
undoubtedly
must
be
wrong.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
this
court
well
knows
from
experience
that
there's
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
people
in
certain
ethnic
groups
to
settle
in
large
cities
in
certain
areas
and
these
reasons
have
a
great
variety,
a
great
range
of
reasons
for
this.
it
may
range
all
the
way
from
the
desire
to
live
amongst
the
other
members
of
the
same
ethnic
group
and
it
can
go
all
the
way
to
such
things
as
discrimination
and
housing
but
whatever
the
reasons
and
whatever
the
degree
of
those
reasons,
the
fact
is
and
it's
a
real
fact
of
life
and
certainly
a
fact
of
life
in
the
island
of
manhattan
as
it
is
in
many
other
cities
of
the
united
states
that
people
tend
to
create
to
--
to
gather
very
often
and
reside
very
often
in
certain
ethnic
concentrations
in
the
neighborhood
if
you
will.
and
in
this
particular
case,
what
we're
dealing
with
mostly
was
citing
eastside
of
manhattan,
what
counsel
has
been
pleased
to
refer
to
as
the
lily
white
district.
we
were
also
dealing
with
that
well-known
area
called
harlem
with
approximately
a
quarter
of
the
island's
1,700,000
population,
one
of
the
greatest
ethnic
concentrations
and
even
in
new
york
city
area
and
in
the
united
states.
now,
this
as
i
say
only
reflects
a
common
place,
this
congressional
districting
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
ironic
that
the
appellants
have
relied
and
that
judge
murphy,
the
dissenting
judge
below,
went
right
along
reading
the
case
the
same
way.
the
hernandez
case
apparently
is
that
on
which
appellants
relied
for
the
first
part
of
this
curious
theory
of
burden
of
proof.
and
your
honors
well
remember
how
totally
different
the
hernandez
case
was.
there
was
a
case
where
over
a
period
of
i
think
25
years
or
generation
or
so,
mexicans
were
not
able
--
those
of
mexican
descent
and
origin
rather,
i
don't
mean
mexican
citizens.
american
citizens
of
mexican
descent
were
never
to
be
found
on
any
jury
panel
in
the
state
of
texas
and
this
of
course
is
a
very
unique
situation.
could
one
say
that
there
are
no
people
of
mexican
heritage
who
would
be
qualified
for
jury
service
in
the
state
of
texas
or
any
other
state?
this
was
so
unique,
so
uncommon,
so
extraordinary
situation
but
of
course
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
state
to
go
forward
and
explain
this
tremendous
anomaly.
that's
an
entirely
different
case.
here
you
had
a
case
which
if
it's
akin
to
anything
in
that
respect
might
much
more
be
akin
to
the
case,
for
example,
of
a
negro
tried
in
a
criminal
case
let's
say
a
capital
case
and
not
a
negro
on
that
particular
jury.
well
now,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
label
the
point
that
nobody
in
the
united
states,
white,
negro
or
otherwise
can
claim
that
he
is
entitled
in
a
particular
jury
under
particular
circumstances
to
have
a
juryman
of
his
own
ethnic
background
or
jurymen
of
his
own
ethnic
background
on
the
particular
panel
or
on
--
in
the
particular
case.
that's
quite
a
far
cry
from
hernandez
but
certainly,
hernandez
which
was
relied
upon
by
mr.
feldman
so
heavily
and
by
judge
murphy
as
his
opinion
will
show
offers
anything
but
support
for
the
curious
theory
that
mr.
feldman
advances.
now,
isn't
it
a
logical
culmination
of
a
theory
such
as
suggested
by
mr.
feldman,
isn't
it
inevitable
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
that
theory,
wouldn't
we
be
lead
in
the
direction
of
having
to
mix
the
races
in
certain
proportions
in
congressional
districts?
for
instance,
there
are
37.5%,
maybe
it's
38%
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
residents
in
the
island
of
manhattan.
and
if
were
to
carry
out
logically
the
--
the
--
the
theories
that
are
being
expounded
here
a
few
moments
ago
by
mr.
feldman,
we
would
have
to
think
in
terms
of
--
of
--
of
equalizing
the
racial
in
all
four
of
them
--
this
shows
only
two
of
the
districts
but
on
all
four
of
manhattan's
districts,
we'd
have
districts
vis-à-vis
one
another
which
are
roughly
37
--
38%
negro,
puerto
rican
if
we
were
to
follow
that
its
logical
culmination.
and
although
it
may
not
be
strictly
relevant
to
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
i
think
this
might
be
a
good
point
at
which
to
get
into
the
subject
of
--
and
i
mention
as
is
this,
"a
fallacy
of
speaking
of
segregation
in
the
context
of
congressional
districting."
now,
there
are
no
cases
extent
and
i
think
that
will
be
agreed
to
that
say,
"that
this
is
an
angle
in
a
congressional
districting
case.
it's
necessary
in
congressional
districting
to
classify
every
time
a
districting
is
going
to
be
made
and
i
don't
care
what
the
motive,
what
the
criteria,
no
matter
what
the
reason.
whenever
a
congressional
districting
is
done,
the
result
inevitably
is
going
to
be
either
where
you
have
a
law
at
neighborhood
by
column
with
a
tremendous
concentration
of
one
ethnic
--
or
one
or
two
ethnic
groups.
the
result
inevitably
will
be
either
to
concentrate
them
at
one
district
or
to
divide
and
disperse
them
among
two
or
more
districts,
it
can't
happen
any
other
way.
and
no
matter
what
lines
is
drawn,
this
is
the
inevitably
and
variable
result.
now,
school
cases
in
which
the
term
"segregation"
is
used
so
extensibly.
of
course,
in
the
root
case,
in
the
original
cases
under
the
school
segregation
situation
going
back
10
years
of
whereabouts
to
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
brown
case.
in
that
case,
you
had
state
action
exemplified
by
statutes
simply
setting
up
segregated
negroes
schools
and
segregated
white
schools
and
this
was
struck
down
of
course
in
the
brown
case
and
there,
the
state
statutes
had
made
segregation
mandatory
on
the
brown
integration
was
made
mandatory
and
the
central
constitutional
fact
there
of
course
was
the
inadequacy
of
segregated
education,
a
touchstone,
if
you
please,
by
which
you
can
measure
a
standard
--
a
constitutional
standard
to
be
applied
in
a
situation
of
that
sort
and
to
understand
the
proper
use
of
the
word
“segregation”
in
the
context
of
that
kind
of
a
district.
because
a
school
district
is
a
districting
situation
just
as
is
a
congressional
district
situation
in
the
sense
that
lines
must
be
drawn.
mr.
irving
galt
which
one
was
that,
your
honor?
mr.
irving
galt
with
a
district
so
that
in
each
instance,
the
concentration
of
8th
became
a
separate
district
though
8th
--
i
mis
--
mr.
irving
galt
from
a
constitutional
standpoint?
mr.
irving
galt
i
would
say
yes.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
such
situation
ever
likely
or
imminent
in
the
state
of
new
york
but
if
we're
talking
constitutionally,
yes
because
we
do
not
have
the
same
constitutional
or
--
or
the
same
standards
that
we
can
readily
apply
it
here
as
we
do
in
school
cases.
now,
i
wanted
to
show
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
i
might,
that
there's
all
--
a
world
of
difference
in
the
case.
now,
these
were
impermissible
objectives,
these
ideas
of
having
white
schools,
and
negro
schools,
what
in
congressional
districting,
i
submit
and
i
think
it's
beyond
any
argument
that
there
is
no
such
set
of
fact
as
the
inadequacy
for
instance
of
segregated
education.
this
may
be
in
the
sense
anticipating
the
argument
that
i
hope
later
to
make
on
the
law
but
i
touched
on
it
briefly
because
of
the
inappropriate
use
of
the
word
"segregation"
here.
but
after
the
brown
case,
we
began
to
have
some
new
phenomenon,
when
--
when
segregation
was
caused
for
instance
by
school
district
lines
in
the
context
of
existing
neighborhoods
and
we
--
existing
racial
neighborhood.
and
schools
persisted
in
their
segregation
not
because
of
any
plan
and
deliberate
design
but
because
of
the
neighborhood
concept,
problems
arose
just
the
same.
and
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief
at
several
places
a
very
interesting
decision
which
was
made
by
judge
dooling
of
the
eastern
district
court
of
new
york
in
the
branche
case,
rather
recently.
in
fact,
mr.
sandifer
was
a
counsel,
one
of
the
counsels
in
that
case.
and
there,
mr.
--
there,
judge
dooling
held
at
the
mere
existence
of
de
facto
segregation
was
unconstitutional
and
there's
a
good
reason
that
the
term
“segregation”
can
be
applied
in
that
sort
of
case
because
there,
it's
possible
to
isolate
what
is
constitutionally
desirable.
mr.
irving
galt
political?
mr.
irving
galt
well
now,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
when
we're
dealing
with
congressional
districting,
we're
certainly
dealing
with
large
groups
of
people.
we're
not
dealing
with
individuals
as
we
are
at
jury
box
cases
or
in
seating
in
a
court
or
in
bus
transportation,
things
of
that
sort.
we're
not
dealing
with
individuals.
we
are
dealing
with
a
large
group
of
people
and
it
may
be
true
that
i
forget
the
plaintiff's
name,
mrs.
wright,
i
think
is
the
first
plaintiff.
mrs.
wright
or
ms.
wright
as
the
case
might
be.
ms.
wright
may
have
some
sort
of
a
desire
along
the
lines
that
your
honor
mentioned.
but
the
fact
is
that
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
when
it's
necessary
for
a
legislature
to
deal
with
these
large
numbers
of
people,
we're
not
impinging
on
individual
rights
and
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
in
his
questioning
of
mr.
feldman
a
few
moments
back,
there
is
here
an
entirely
different
situation
and
that
is
the
question
if
--
if
need
be,
who
is
to
determine
whether
from
a
--
from
a
judicial
standpoint,
who
is
to
determine
whether
a
minority
group,
negroes,
puerto
ricans
or
any
other
minority
groups
for
that
matter
are
better
off
when
they
concentrated
one
district
or
dispersed?
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
black
began
to
suggest
in
his
questions.
several
very
good
reasons
that
easily
could
be
elaborated
upon
why
it
might
be
a
very
excellent
idea
for
power
to
be
concentrated
for
the
political
power
of
a
minority
group
in
congressional
districting
and
considering
the
functions
of
a
single
method
district
system,
it
might
very
well
be
a
very
idea
if
it
concentrates
that
political
power
there.
but
we
are
not
weighing
the
relative
merits
of
these
two
opposite
concepts.
what
we
are
doing
instead,
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
first,
before
even
getting
in
to
all
the
specifics
of
the
district
to
show
the
great
difference,
for
instance,
between
school
districting
cases
which
are
after
all
in
a
sense
districting
cases
and
congressional
districting
cases,
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
this
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
constitutional
result
and
in
the
burden
of
proof
and
in
everything
else.
but
there
in
the
school
case
as
you
can
apply
the
term
“segregation”
because
certainly,
it's
possible
as
i
was
saying
just
before
to
isolate
what
is
constitutionally
desirable.
and
the
only
direction
in
which
you
can
move
and
have
to
touch
on
that,
you
have
the
desideratum,
is
in
the
direction
of
integration,
that's
clear
in
the
school
cases
but
--
mr.
irving
galt
right.
very
much
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
exactly
so.
but
first,
we're
going
to
establish
if
we
can
and
i
think
that
this
record
does
establish
it
and
all
the
applicable
principles
will
show
it
that
even
under
any
theory
of
their
own
purely
from
a
standpoint
of
quantum
of
proof,
all
that
sort
of
thing,
they've
made
no
case
in
any
event.
not
only
as
a
matter
of
law
but
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
irving
galt
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
they're
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
yes.
but
i
would
not
--
i
--
as
i
say,
this
is
such
a
farfetched
example.
i
see
no
--
i
see
no
practical
possibilities
of
that.
however,
i
would
say
that
if
such
a
thing
were
conceivable
in
the
state
of
new
york,
i
would
say
that
from
a
constitutional
standpoint,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
now,
in
--
in
congressional
districting,
the
term
"segregation"
means
what?
it
can
only
mean
one
thing,
it
means
you
--
they
must
disperse
them
and
are
the
--
or
you
must
concentrate
them
among
several
districts
and
without
elaborating
on
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
another
singular
argument
of
the
appellants
as
i
see
it
and
this
is
an
extremely
intriguing
too,
they
suggest
that
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
contrary
to
the
normal
principles
applicable
in
cases
because
this
is
a
civil
liberties
rather
than
an
economic
regulation
case.
now,
i
submit
that
that's
plainly
wrong.
one
cannot
read
for
instance
the
mcgowan
case
without
realizing
that
this
is
just
bad
law,
that
is
not
so.
the
mcgowan
case
illustrates
it
very
clearly
and
another
interesting
aspect
of
this
is
that
if
it
were
true
that
the
burden
would
shift
on
a
showing,
such
as
they
have
made,
the
--
we
would
be
moving
in
the
direction
of
requiring
a
proper
proportionate
mixture
of
the
races
in
the
various
districts
as
i've
noticed
be
--
as
i've
noted
before,
and
any
district
would
be
suspect,
constitutionally
suspect
when
it
didn't
have
the
same
racial
proportions
as
its
neighbor,
and
therefore,
the
state
would
have
to
move,
as
i
said,
in
this
direction
of
a
proper
mix,
and
i
think
that
this
can
be
summed
up
very
quickly.
the
point
is
they
had
to
show
at
the
very,
very
least
an
absence
of
other
--
any
other
substantial
purpose
for
the
redistricting.
in
other
words,
they
had
to
show
that
race
was
a
more
likely
basis
for
the
district
lines
than
the
other
and
much
more
usual
basis
of
districting,
and
i
would
suppose
--
mr.
irving
galt
oh
yes,
under
their
view.
mr.
irving
galt
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
say
that
the
--
but
the
point
is
that
they
did
not
even
show
and
we'll
establish
this
even
further
as
we
refer
to
the
specifics.
they
didn't
even
show
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
they
fell
far
short
of
showing
that
race
was
the
basis
for
this
districting.
and
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
the
only
way
they
could
show
what
i've
just
alluded
to,
that
is
that
race
was
a
more
likely
basis,
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
state
went
about
this
in
such
a
determined,
persistent
way
to
borrow
mr.
feldman's
own
phrase,
twisting
and
turning
in
and
out,
a
ferreting
out
of
a
cluster
of
a
minority
here,
a
block
of
the
minority
there
in
a
--
in
what
might
enormous
be
called
a
paranoid
tendency
to
see
to
it
that
these
two
sharply
contrasting
districts,
lily
white
and
all
negro
puerto
rican,
are
setup
side
by
side.
and
i
--
i
will
show
that
they
are
far,
far
from
presenting
anything
of
a
case
in
that
regard.
now,
i
say
they
failed
to
present
the
prima
facie
case
on
the
facts
here
and
they
relied
on
four
particular
avenues
of
proof
and
they
were
illustrating
that
in
a
sense
when
mr.
feldman
was
pointing
to
the
map
and
going
around
boundary
lines
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
the
first
of
the
four
things
that
they
relied
on
and
they
failed
and
failed
utterly
in
all
four,
the
first
of
these
four,
and
we'd
gone
over
to
--
gone
over
to
some
extent
and
i
won't
dwell
upon
it,
is
the
sharp
disparity
between
the
districts
in
the
way
of
a
racial
concentration
and
all
that
this
does
as
i
pointed
out
before
to
reflect
the
tendency
of
minorities.
they
live
together
and
only
one
thing
in
this
connection
might
be
of
special
interest
and
that
is
the
hypotheticals
to
which
the
appellants
referred
both
of
the
trials
below
and
to
some
extent
here.
first,
they
had
in
their
proof
before
the
statutory
court.
they
were
allowed
to
testify
the
hypothetical
expansions
of
the
17th
district
and
one
of
these
expansions
which
involved
locking
stuyvesant
town,
that
would
be
this
end
so
that's
all
right.
the
stuyvesant
town
would
be
the
area
in
here
your
honors.
i
think
this
map
is
the
one
which
you
can
most
easily
see,
i
think
it
will
suffice
for
our
purposes.
the
stuyvesant
town
additionally
in
over
here,
this
was
one
expansion,
if
this
would
drop
from
the
district,
the
western
border
strait
and
if
the
districts
were
expanded
north
in
behala,
this
was
one
of
the
hypotheticals,
and
interestingly
enough,
what
did
the
17th
district
come
up
with
in
the
way
of
a
percentage
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans?
8.
--
13.8
in
comparison
to
the
present
5.1.
and
again,
on
another
--
on
another
change
of
boundaries
to
enlarge
the
17th
district,
what
is
the
percentage
this
time?
8.5.
merely
driving
home
harder
and
harder,
the
fact
that
any
way
you
do
it,
it
still
comes
out
that
if
you're
anywhere
in
this
neighborhood
and
you're
concentrating
in
--
more
or
less
in
concentrating
the
group
that
remains
in
it,
these
are
the
kind
of
percentages
with
some
variation
that
you're
going
to
have.
and
then
there
are
other
hypotheses
and
i
won't
--
i
won't
show
you
the
hypothetical
--
the
three
hypotheses
which
the
plaintiff
was
referring
to
and
pointing
to
earlier,
your
honors
will
recollect
them
various
ways
of
dividing
the
county
north
and
south,
east
and
west
in
four
or
five
permutations
or
combinations
in
this
sort
of
second
guessing
the
legislature
game.
i
submit
that
we
could
easily
in
a
county
like
new
york
give
your
honors
a
thousand
of
them.
i
don't
see
the
point
to
it,
but
i
do
see
one
point
which
i
think
in
the
appellant's
own
hypothesis
will
be
of
interest
to
your
honors
and
that
is
again,
using
all
these
criteria
which
of
course,
as
your
honors
pointed
out
during
mr.
feldman's
own
argument
are
not
legal
criteria
sense
of
track
which
are
purely
arbitrary.
in
the
record,
you
will
define
them
as
arbitrary
things.
you
will
find
that
a
enumeration
districts
were
arbitrarily
done
is
not
the
senses.
it's
not
the
united
states
senses
what
does
congressional
redistricting,
it's
the
new
york
state
legislature
but
coming
back
to
these
hypothetical
districts,
it's
very
interesting
that
in
one
of
the
hypothetical
districting
--
districts,
i
think
its
--
exhibits
6
(b).
they
have
a
percentage
of
9.5,
a
little
less
than
twice
the
present
percentage
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans,
a
very
negligible
percentage
when
we're
viewing
it
in
that
context
and
even
though
mr.
feldman
may
say
that
this
end
result
doesn't
matter,
i
simply
must
wonder
and
i
confess
that
i
do
but
what
all
the
shooting
is
about
because
if
this
were
to
be
an
exercise
in
futility,
if
by
some
peculiar
formula,
the
new
york
legislature
could
go
about
it
or
were
to
go
about
at
mr.
feldman's
way
that
came
up
the
same
way,
evidently
he'd
be
perfectly
satisfied
and
i
don't
know
what
we're
doing
in
court
if
that
be
the
case.
however,
the
interesting
thing
is
that
even
their
hypotheticals
are
pretty
close
to
the
existing
situation
in
some
cases.
now,
they
said
in
their
argument
and
this
is
where
mr.
feldman
was
performing
surgery,
he
was
talking
about
the
scalpel
that
the
new
york
legislature
uses
and
i
submit
that
i've
got
only
one
thing
out
of
that,
and
that
is
that
the
new
york
legislature
even
surgically
speaking,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
could
well
have
done
a
much,
much
better
job
but
let's
take
the
flat
statement
that
they
make.
the
17th
district
could
not
possibly
be
expanded
or
straightened
without
altering
its
racial
homogeneity.
well,
that's
not
even
borne
out
by
the
record.
for
instance,
let
me
point
out
this
to
your
honors,
if
i
may,
and
if
there's
any
slight
inaccuracy
of
my
recollection
of
my
figures,
i'm
sure
i'll
be
swiftly
corrected.
but,
mr.
feldman
pointed
to
this
section
because
this
was
a
--
this
section
just
(inaudible)
of
the
new
17th
district
line,
the
1961
newly
created
line,
and
anticipating
our
argument
and
recalling
of
course
some
of
the
skirmishing
in
the
court
below,
mr.
feldman
was
quick
to
point
out
that
even
though
this
has
a
very
low
concentration
of
negroes
in
this
--
in
this
particular
portion
outside
of
the
17th
district.
and
even
though
it's
a
highly
concentrated
wide
area,
it
was
not
included
in
the
17th
district
and
why
said
mr.
feldman
when
it
would
so
obvious
if
he
used
his
own
expression,
the
new
york
legislature
were
twisting
and
turning
and
using
the
scope
of
the
such
devastating
effect,
why
then
would
they
leave
this
area
here,
and
i
submit
that
mr.
feldman
hasn't
answered.
in
the
first
place,
the
reference
to
a
housing
project;
to
begin
with,
the
housing
project
is
only
in
this
track,
the
smaller
track
here
between
93rd
and
95th
street
east
of
first
avenue
at
--
in
this
direction
but
this
other
track
alone
without
reference
to
what's
left
over
in
this
track
has
something
like
7,500
people.
the
entire
track
i
believe
is
10,000
in
sum
--
10,000
to
11
in
that
neighborhood
and
then
mr.
feldman
managed
and
produced
a
letter
in
the
court
below
while
we're
in
the
process
of
the
closing
arguments,
he
got
a
letter
from
the
board
of
estimate
which
is
in
the
record.
i
think
it's
in
exhibit
7,
but
this
letter
said
that
in
1959,
a
resolution
for
a
housing
project
was
passed
between
93rd
and
95th
street.
and
that
at
some
date,
not
specified
in
the
letter,
and
this
letter
was
written
in
august
of
1962,
the
end
of
the
month
when
we
were
concluding
the
trial
of
this
very
case,
at
some
unspecified
date
a
tentative
expansion
of
two
blocks
and
the
93rd
to
91st
but
still
in
the
same
area
it
was
planted.
now,
i
submit,
that
beyond
any
and
all
possibility,
the
legislature
very
easily
if
it
were
bent
on
what
mr.
feldman
has
pictured
as
the
senator's
purpose
very
easily
could
and
would
have
put
this
in.
if
it
were
exhibiting
this
paranoid
tendency
to
ferret
out
here
and
ferret
out
there,
to
include
here
and
to
exclude
there,
this
is
the
most
obvious
thing
that
they
could
have
done.
now,
in
stuyvesant
town;
stuyvesant
town
was
added;
of
course
the
district
has
to
be
enlarged.
the
only
districts
in
manhattan
had
to
be
enlarged.
they
were
to
be
43
districts
--
41
districts
instead
of
43.
new
york
county
had
to
have
four
districts
instead
of
six
and
this
was
one
single
project
right
down
here
at
the
southern
--
southeastern
portion
which
--
and
right
up
here
is
peter
cooper,
already
in
the
district.
when
mr.
feldman
mentioned
it,
i
don't
think
that
was
made
clear
to
the
court
but
peter
cooper
and
i
think
most
of
your
honors
may
--
maybe
familiar,
have
seen
physically
this
thing
peter
cooper
and
stuyvesant
town
are
almost
indistinguishable
to
the
eye
when
one
goes
by
even
a
native
of
new
yorker
like
myself.
i
doubt
i'd
like
to
tell
when
i
left
peter
cooper
and
when
i've
arrived
at
stuyvesant
town.
when
i
go
buy
in
a
car,
i
do
not
know
the
difference
and
that
was
added
on.
now,
let's
take
some
of
these
--
these
border
track
situations,
the
southern
border.
there
are
many
tracks
fall
around,
i
won't
be
able
to
get
them
all
and
time
won't
permit
it
but
i
think
by
a
few
illustrations,
it
should
be
fairly
simple
and
clear
to
show
that
by
no
means
that
the
new
york
legislature
do
the
efficient
surgery
which
mr.
feldman
was
so
picturesquely
describing
to
the
court
not
to
many
in
its
regard.
but
over
here,
this
area
right
here,
mr.
feldman
dismissed
this
area
rather
summarily
i
thought
and
the
actual
figures
are
6,862
with
a
percentage
of
12.2
negro
and
puerto
rican,
making
a
total
of
about
i
think,
837.
and
the
evidence
shows
at
page
88
of
the
record,
this
would
have
been
added
and
the
white
population
would
have
been
increased
and
even
me
i
could
tell
going
around
this
district.
for
instance,
let's
take
south
of
west
four
and
west
third
of
this
area
which
again,
mr.
feldman
rather
lightly
dismissed.
in
the
area
are
3,000
--
there
are
1,062,
no.
below
this
area,
3,000
to
3,500
people
according
to
the
testimony
which
was
at
the
--
at
page
69
of
the
record
and
there
is
10
to
15%
concentration
in
the
area,
it's
another
area
which
we
went
at.
and
what
explained
this
little
triangular
area
if
the
chairman
of
new
york
state
legislature
with
this
paranoid
bent
of
mind
so
were
destructively
set
on
creating
purely
equal
districts
of
an
opposite
racial
characteristics.
why
leave
this
pocket?
the
figures
for
this
pocket
are
1,062
people
of
which
approximately
375,
35.9%
and
maybe
380
--
365
but
approximately
that
number
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
this
area
and
we
can
see
that
going
all
around.
some
of
these
western
border
situations
are
also
interesting.
one
can
look
visually
at
this
presentation
of
mr.
feldman
on
this
exhibit
and
see
nearly
from
the
coloring
on
the
track
--
on
the
census
tracks
of
what
the
situation
was
that
mr.
feldman
found
it
necessary
to
go
with
the
such
shades
of
differences
at
the
--
percentage
difference
in
the
same
overall
percentage
tracks
on
one
side
of
the
other.
we
can
reverse
that
if
we
want
to
go
up
to,
for
instance,
62nd
to
66th
street.
i
don't
know
exactly
where
that
is
here
but
it's
somewhere
--
must
be
somewhere
along
here.
mr.
mahoney
points
through
that
this
is
it.
you
can
tell
by
the
coloration
of
the
tracks.
in
this
area,
you
will
find
149
on
a
16.6
percentage
inside,
a
149
inside
the
district
and
only
seven
on
a
7.8
percentage
outside
the
district.
so
what
do
mr.
feldman's
elaborate
travelogue
and
elaborate
trips
around
the
borders
of
the
district
show?
it
only
shows
that
if
you
hold
it
up,
the
more
careful
analytical
inspection,
you
are
much
more
likely
to
find
the
opposite
than
in
any
other
way.
now,
and
i
just
want
to
add
one
more
thing
to
this
matter
of
expansion.
this
--
this
whole
thing
is
absurd.
it
seems
to
me
the
17th
is
not
underpopulated.
let
me
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
new
york
voluntary
and
without
any
requirement
of
law,
voluntarily
adhered
to
withstand
it
in
its
congressional
districts
and
i
will
say,
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
among
the
large
states
at
least
that
is
the
best
in
that
regard
that
maybe
in
the
ban
among
all
states,
it
certainly
close
to
it
among
all
50,
but
new
york
voluntarily
adheres
to
a
population
variation
of
15%
from
the
average
district,
and
these
manhattan
districts,
the
largest,
has
a
variation
of
9%
from
the
state
average
and
the
smallest,
the
17th
which
we've
been
discussing
so
much
a
variation
of
about
7%.
and
i
can't
understand
the
context
in
which
mr.
feldman
uses
it,
unless
he's
suggesting
and
this
is
a
very
interesting
theory
too
in
itself,
unless
he's
suggesting
that
somehow
there's
a
constitutional
standard
by
which
if
you're
going
to
have
more
population
in
one
district
than
on
another,
the
one
district
being
negro
or
puerto
rican
or
some
other
minority
group
and
the
other
being
white
that
constitutionally
one
race
must
be
in
the
lower
population
district
so
that
there
be
not
overrepresentation
with
respect
to
the
other
race.
this
is
all
i
can
gather
from
the
argument
because
otherwise,
what
significance
these
populations
have?
new
york
surely
is
not
being
assailed
because
of
its
deviation
from
a
population
standard
and
the
creation
of
its
congressional
districts
and
i
can
see
no
other
relevance
to
mr.
feldman's
argument
but
that.
now
–
mr.
irving
galt
how
many
districts
in
new
york?
41.
there
we're
43
prior
to
the
redistricting.
mr.
irving
galt
i'd
--
i
would
assume
that
there
maybe
some
that
are
county
lines,
but
as
far
as
i
know,
that
hasn't
been
the
primary
basis.
certainly,
in
the
metropolitan
area,
the
county
lines
have
not
been
the
basis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
see
today's
four
districts
wholly
contained
within
manhattan
island,
that's
the
county
of
new
york,
and
there
was
a
time
and
this
ties
into
the
history
of
congressional
districting
in
new
york
county
and
that
we'll
show
again
the
fallacy
of
all
of
mr.
feldman's
assertion.
but
there
was
a
time
until
about
1941
when
we
have
in
the
records
the
maps
of
the
1911
redistricting,
the
1917
and
some
other
dates,
1920
something
--
i
think
it
was
1922,
1941,
1951
and
the
present
1961.
but
there
was
a
time
until
at
least
the
1941
districting
and
i'm
not
sure
from
my
own
recollection
what
but
that
this
maybe
--
and
may
have
been
true
likewise
of
1941,
but
there
was
a
time
when
new
york
county
congressional
districts
spread
over
the
waters
to
staten
island,
on
to
the
bronx
and
all
that.
i
may
not
remember
the
detail
but
they
are
in
the
record
and
that
the
county
lines
were
disregarded,
so
i
would
assume
mr.
justice
black
that
congressional
--
as
far
--
from
the
standpoint
of
congressional
districts,
i
think
i'm
correct
in
saying
that
county
lines
are
not
the
critical
thing.
unlike
–
mr.
irving
galt
in
new
york?
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
yes.
this
will
do
--
this
usually
will
follow
the
street.
in
fact,
i
think
they
do
and
here
again,
let
me
--
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
ordinarily
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
here
again,
let
me
make
--
pardon?
mr.
irving
galt
yes
and
here
again,
let
me
make
some
references.
mr.
feldman
spoke
very
eloquently
about
physical
boundaries.
well
we
know,
of
course
that
new
york
county
does
not
have
a
lot
of
rivers
running
through
it,
no
mountains
or
anything
like
that.
we
have
central
park.
we
have
other
parks,
but
obviously
and
i
think
every
justice
of
this
court
must
know
it,
these
are
not
the
important
boundaries
in
new
york.
if
we
want
to
look
into
boundaries
and
criteria
like
boundaries,
anyone
of
the
justices
and
i'm
sure
some
of
the
justices
of
this
court
may
have
done
it
if
we
stand
up
here,
i
can't
quite
reach
it,
at
98th
street,
96th
street
here,
and
park
avenue,
i
think
this
is
the
juncture
here
up
around
the
end
of
the
boundary
line
there
and
one
can
look
to
the
northeast
and
see
right
across
the
street
from
he's
standing
on
park
avenue
of
all
the
squaller
in
the
world.
all
the
poor
neighborhood
that
you
want
and
just
turn
slowly
around
in
the
other
direction
and
look
south
and
southeast
and
you'll
see
a
neighborhood
of
luxury
apartments
of,
apartments
of
great
magnificent
--
magnificence.
these
are
differences
that
you
might
see
but
what
significance
traffic
lights
or
crossway
through
fares
or
anything
like
that
i
can't
possibly
see.
now,
they
have
relied
on
the
history
of
the
17th
and
18th
districts.
they
have
said
two
blocks
were
prodded
up
here.
and
--
and
then
in
rearranging
the
district,
there
wasn't
much
difference
in
the
step
configuration
but
you'll
notice
this
little
portion
from
the
red
line
to
the
green
line.
simple
explanation,
that's
mount
sinai
hospital.
mount
sinai
hospital
now
expands
this
entire
distance
and
the
streets,
100th
street
that's
in
the
record,
one
of
the
plaintiff's
own
witnesses
testified
to
that.
now,
the
street
is
closed
and
it's
a
physical
fact,
no
one
will
dispute
it,
though
it
makes
sense
to
put
the
hospital
in
one
district
than
the
other.
the
total
of
people
in
it
and
i
suppose
they
were
mostly
residents
in
terms
of
people
(inaudible)
only
800.
the
percentage
i
don't
recall
it
correctly.
mr.
feldman
will
correct
me
if
it's
much
over
50%
negro
or
puerto
rican,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is,
and
that
fact
holds
the
unit
as
far
as
mount
sinai
hospital
up
there
and
that
border
is
concerned.
now,
the
stuyvesant
town
addition
i
mentioned
before,
there
was
that
need
for
expansion
and
that
--
and
i
also
mentioned
that
the
areas
around
here,
the
only
significant
change
is
the
red
line
will
show
us
taking
in
district
and
why
is
mr.
feldman's
suspicions
about
the
new
york
legislature
were
correct,
it
didn't
go
up
here
and
no
one
will
ever
be
able
and
successfully
to
explain,
like
they
put
in
this
and
that's
the
change.
they
built
on
the
lines
that
existed.
here
is
the
1951
line,
the
green
line.
and
essentially
the
district
added
present
configuration.
i
think
too
it
did
very
largely
in
1941,
but
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
build
on
the
same
congressional
district
lines?
after
all,
what
does
a
congressman
do?
he
represents
people
and
people
in
a
certain
area
have
political
clubs
built.
you
have
all
of
these
things.
it
will
--
will
a
legislature
in
its
right
mind
tamper
with
the
existing
politics
of
the
people
in
that
sense?
there's
reason
for
it
and
what
the
legislature
did
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
green
--
the
green
is
41
or
51.
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon,
51,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
to
prior
for
it.
mr.
irving
galt
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
but
this
was
the
existing
border.
there
were
six
districts
in
new
york
at
the
time.
i
--
i
will
say
this,
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
you'll
notice
that
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
is
that
historically,
these
districts
were
bad
in
the
same
way.
repeated
efforts
were
made
to
do
something
about
it.
new
york
legislature
never
did
anything
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
appellants
or
the
plaintiffs
never
came
forward
with
an
iota
of
proof
about
it.
and
the
record
is
bare
of
any
suggestion
of
anything
sinister
there.
if
--
if
mr.
feldman
wants
to
take
the
position
that
it's
unnecessary
to
prove
it,
fine.
we
think
it's
unnecessary
to
prove
it
because
there
isn't
anything
things
to
prove
anyway
but
if
it's
unnecessary
to
prove
it
then
we
can't
expect
to
find
in
the
record
any
explanation
of
this
particular
configuration.
the
only
thing
it
does
suggest
that
is
perfectly
logical
to
me
is
that
the
legislature
did
a
magnifying
job
in
improving
the
physical
contours
of
the
lines.
they
now
are
much
more
regular
than
they
were
before.
mr.
justice
white's
question
implicitly
suggests
that
and
the
only
thing
i
could
tell
you
is
that
if
a
legislature
did
anything,
they
did
quite
a
nice
job
of
regularizing
the
district
now
that
we
only
had
four
instead
of
six.
now,
i
think
i
can
sum
up
the
evidence
to
say
--
well,
perhaps
i
better
not
sum
up
any
evidence.
my
time
remaining
is
less
than
three
minutes.
i
don't
believe
i'll
even
be
able
to
argue
a
lot
and
some
of
the
time
mr.
sander
will
have
--
i
only
regret
that
i
cannot.
i
think
rather
than
start
upon
a
new
course
of
argument
which
i
won't
have
time
to
develop,
i
will
simply
say
that
i'm
very
appreciative
of
the
court's
indulgence
and
consideration
in
this
and
in
the
prior
wmca
case
and
turn
over
the
argument
to
mr.
sandifer.
