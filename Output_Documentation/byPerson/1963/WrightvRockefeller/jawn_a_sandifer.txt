mr.
jawn
a.
sandifer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
intervenors
in
this
action.
the
intervenors
consist
of
congressman
adam
clayton
powell
of
the
18th
congressional
district
together
with
all
of
the
district
leaders
who
are
also
comprised
within
the
18th
congressional
district,
all
of
them
are
negroes
with
exception
of
one
puerto
rican
district
leader
in
the
14th
assembly
district.
all
of
the
intervenors
are
members
of
the
democratic
party
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are
all
members
of
the
county
executive
committee.
now,
we
take
the
very
limited
position
here
before
this
court
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
lines
under
attack
were
drawn
based
upon
a
racial
consideration.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
that
position
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
was
taken
by
the
intervenors
in
the
court
below.
we
do
not
feel
further
that
this
particular
case
falls
within
the
mainstream
of
the
civil
rights
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
i
would
only
refer
your
honors
to
pages
121
and
122
of
the
record
that
is
before
you.
you
will
note
in
the
opening
part
of
my
argument
in
the
court
below,
i
specifically
stated
to
the
court
that
if
i
personally
believed
for
a
moment
that
the
basis
for
redrawing
the
lines
in
the
17th
congressional
district
were
based
upon
race
or
place
of
origin,
i
would
be
the
first
to
join
the
plaintiffs
in
the
relief
which
they
were
seeking
here.
and
on
page
122,
in
response
to
the
question
that
was
put
to
me
by
judge
feinberg,
when
he
said,
"is
it
your
position
that
if
they
were
drawn
on
a
racial
basis,
you
would
agree
with
the
plaintiffs
that
that
was
unconstitutional?"
and
my
answer
unequivocally
was,
“i
would
wholeheartedly
say
yes.”
now,
i
want
to
take
this
opportunity
your
honors
to
specifically
disagree
with
the
position
that
mr.
galt
took
in
response
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
and
in
further
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
i
take
the
position
completely
and
unequivocally
that
if
the
state
legislature
used
race
as
a
consideration
in
drawing
of
these
district
lines
that
the
lines
would
be
absolutely
unconstitutional
and
the
court
would
have
to
so
decide.
that's
the
position
that
i
take.
i
do
not
associate
myself
with
that
position.
i
want
to
say
further
that
there's
some
reference
in
the
record
here
before
the
court
and
i
think
there's
some
reference
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
that
we
are
arguing
for
what
we
consider
and
deemed
to
be
good
segregation.
i
think
that
judge
feinberg
uses
--
makes
that
remark.
i
say
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
before
this
court
for
that
particular
statement.
we
do
not
argue
that.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
thing
as
good
segregation.
i
think
judge
feinberg
probably
drew
that
inference
from
the
affirmative
defenses
that
were
originally
raised
by
the
intervenors
in
the
original
action
but
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
affirmative
actions
were
dismissed
by
the
court
below
at
the
conclusion
of
the
entire
case
that
those
affirmative
defenses
are
not
a
part
of
the
record
before
this
court,
that
the
only
on
record
before
this
court
is
the
position
that
we
took
below
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
is
the
position
that
we
have
here.
now
we
do
however,
and
i
want
to
make
our
position
perfectly
clear,
we
do
however
reserve
the
right
to
utilize
our
voting
strength
and
power
to
what
we
deem
to
be
our
best
advantage
as
we
find
large
segments
of
our
negro
population
concentrated
in
one
particular
area.
for
that
we
do
feel
that
we
have
a
right
to
utilize
that
voting
strength
to
the
best
of
our
ability.
we
have
very
little
control
over
the
situations
that
exists
as
far
as
harlem
is
concerned
because
of
the
housing
situation
that
we
are
confronted
with
in
the
state
--
in
city
of
new
york.
but
so
long
as
a
negro,
as
a
race
of
people,
are
not
free
to
participate
and
move
freely
in
an
open
society,
we
will
find
the
harlems
throughout
the
united
states,
not
only
in
new
york
but
throughout
the
united
states,
and
so
long
as
these
harlems
do
exist
such
as
the
18th
congressional
district
in
harlem
then
we'll
feel
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
single
out
the
negroes
and
to
phenomenally
disperse
them
into
other
congressional
districts
on
mr.
feldman’s
theory
that
they
can
be
more
effective
if
that
is
done
or
that
the
efforts
and
desire
on
the
part
of
mr.
feldman
here
is
to
deprive
the
negroes
that
what
has
happened
here
that
negroes
has
been
deprived
of
their
influence
in
the
other
three
congressional
districts
because
i
might
only
remind
mr.
feldman
of
the
situation
as
far
as
the
stuyvesant
section
of
brooklyn
for
an
example
where
we
have
far
more
negroes
concentrated
than
we
do
right
in
harlem
in
the
18th
congressional
district.
some
450,000
negroes
in
stuyvesant
and
i
would
ask
mr.
feldman
or
anyone
else
whether
or
not
a
negro
has
ever
successfully
run
for
congress
and
has
been
elected
in
that
particular
congressional
district.
we
might
also
refer
to
bronx
county
particularly
in
southern
--
the
south
--
southern
part
of
bronx
where
the
big
figures
are
equally
substantial
or
to
queens
where
negroes
in
these
large
concentrated
areas
for
the
very
reason
to
the
fact
that
congressional
district
is
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
the
negroes
are
not
to
be
elected
from
those
particular
districts.
the
intervenors
that
are
here
in
this
particular
case
before
the
court
today,
every
single
negro
that's
in
the
state
legislature
in
the
manhattan
county
that
we
are
talking
about,
every
single
negro
that
is
a
district
leader
that
in
the
state
assembly
are
in
the
city
council
all
comes
out
of
the
18th
congressional
district
and
not
single
negro
district
leader
would
you
find
in
any
of
the
other
three
congressional
districts.
now,
if
there
was
any
proof
and
i
will
make
this
position
clear
also,
that
if
the
lines
were
drawn
on
a
racial
basis
as
has
been
suggested
by
mr.
galt
here
are
raised
in
what's
in
consideration,
i
don't
think
and
i
made
the
statement
of
judge
feinberg
below
that
i
don't
think
that
negro
that
you
would
even
have
to
go
so
far
as
the
show
that
there
was
any
advantage
or
disadvantage
that
flowed
as
result
of
the
lines
having
been
drawn
on
a
race
basis.
i
think
if
you
found
race
involved
regardless
of
whether
it
was
an
advantage
or
disadvantage,
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
hold
that
that
statute
was
unconstitutional.
but
since
mr.
feldman
has
advanced
this
argument
that
negroes
would
be
better
off
if
they
were
dispersed
among
the
other
three
congressional
districts,
i
would
have
to
post
--
pose
that
particular
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
a
negro
who
has
been
boxed
out
of
the
17th
congressional
district
or
--
or
puerto
rican
has
been
boxed
out,
whether
or
not
if
that
line
was
redrawn
to
include
that
particular
negro
or
that
puerto
rican,
whether
or
not
that
negro
or
puerto
rican
would
find
himself
any
better
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
remained
in
the
18th
congressional
district.
i
suggest
that
when
that
negro
woke
up
that
next
morning
or
the
puerto
rican
woke
up
and
found
that
he
was
still
in
the
slum,
that
he
still
economically
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder,
that
he
still
was
without
a
job
or
was
gainfully
employed,
that
his
children
still
were
going
to
the
work
schools
in
the
community,
that
there
was
the
very
little
difference
in
far
as
he
was
concerned
politically
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
any
better
off
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
remained
within
the
18th
congressional
district.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
go
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
the
two
lines
of
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiffs.
first
all,
the
gomillion
cases,
i
think
it
was
judge
--
mr.
justice
black
who
pointed
out
almost
in
the
very
outset
of
mr.
feldman's
argument.
the
gomillion
case
is
so
obviously
distinguishable
from
the
issue
that
involved
in
this
case
that
it
doesn't
need
to
be
belabored
at
all.
obviously,
in
the
gomillion
cases,
where
400
negroes
has
been
cut
out
or
boxed
out
of
macon
county,
that
not
only
were
these
negroes
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
but
they
were
deprived
to
many
other
municipal
facilities
which
they
had
previously
enjoyed.
there's
no
such
showing
in
this
case
at
all.
i
would
even
submit
to
the
court
that
but
for
injection
of
the
issue
of
race
in
this
case
that
this
case
would
have
been
no
different
from
baker
versus
carr
and
the
very
fact
that
they
have
cited
this
particular
gomillion
and
relied
upon
it
together
with
de
facto
school
cases
does
not
bring
this
case
within
the
purview
of
either
one
of
those
cases.
now,
throughout
mr.
feldman's
brief,
he
relied
heavily
upon
branche
versus
board
of
education
of
hempstead.
it
so
happens
that
i
personally
handled
that
case
for
the
new
york
state
conference
and
the
national
association
for
advancement
of
colored
people
and
argued
that
case
before
judge
dooling
and
the
whole
program
or
the
whole
thrust
of
our
arguments
and
all
of
the
de
facto
school
cases
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
court
has
found
that
negro
children
were
educationally
disadvantaged
as
a
result
of
the
segregated
schools
that
they
have
been
going
to
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
and
i
submit
that
even
the
findings
of
the
commissioner
of
education
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
this
de
facto
field,
takes
these
cases
completely
outside
of
the
purview
of
the
argument
that
is
advanced
here,
that
the
negroes
are
being
politically
deprived
to
some
right
and
some
enjoyment
by
being
placed
in
one
congressional
district
as
opposed
to
another.
i
don't
think
that
that
argument
is
sound.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
whole
theory
of
the
de
facto
school
cases
at
all.
