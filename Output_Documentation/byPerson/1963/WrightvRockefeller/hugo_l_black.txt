(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
anybody
been
knocked
out
of
voting
by
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
--
then
you
are
raising
the
question
of
numbers,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
ambiguousness
of
the
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all?
what
--
how
does
it
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
mean
classifying
voters
in
a
particular
area
because
they
are
with
certain
color
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
abstractly
injures
them
by
depriving
them
of
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
in
an
area
where
they're
put
there
because
of
their
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
anytime
as
to
how
there
could
be
any
injury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
that's
all
numbers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
mean
that
you
can
never
put
--
create
a
district?
that
a
--
no
one
there
but
colored
people
if
they
happen
to
live
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
neutrally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
exactly
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
law
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
party
controlled
the
legislature
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
had
been
the
votes
in
this
section.
i'm
asking
this
because
i've
had
some
experience
with
this
and
i've
never
seen
any
year
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
politics
didn't
have
something
to
do
where
one
of
the
parties
with
more
in
getting
advantage
either
by
concentrating
voters
of
one
group
in
a
section
to
keep
them
out
of
other
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
have
--
vice
versa.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
--
cannot
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
time,
the
politics
have
nothing
to
do
with
gomillion.
what
we
found
there
was
and
i
think
properly
that
this
city
was
cut
off
that
way
to
keep
colored
people
from
voting
in
the
city
and
depriving
them
the
right
to
vote
entirely.
it
wasn't
because
of
two-party
fight.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you'd
--
you
say
the
purpose
now
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
rely
on
buchanan
against
warley
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
case
where
the
headed
law
--
law
passed
which
prohibited
colored
people
from
owning
a
property
of
certain
section.
it
was
an
invidious
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
credo.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
wasn't
talking
about
benign,
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
does
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
another
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
for
more
districts,
isn't
it,
instead
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
talking
(voice
overlap)
passed
the
law,
which
was
brought
and
delivered
in
a
certain
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
the
really
crooked
lines
and
reapportionments.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
may
i
suggest
that
there
happen
to
be
some
places
in
this
country
where
nothing
could
happen
better
for
the
colored
people
into
the
district
where
they
could
their
strength
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
in
some
places.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
your
argument
was,
it
seem
to
me
to
set
down
to
be
such
a
terrible
thing
to
have
their
influence
that
concentrates
in
one
district
and
i
happen
to
think
of
some,
where
that
would
be
wonderful
thing
for
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
might
be,
i
didn't
say
that.
