mr.
justin
n.
feldman
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
differs
from
the
state
apportionment
cases
and
from
the
georgia
congressional
district
case,
congressional
districting
case,
because
this
case
involves
racial
gerrymandering.
it
presents
the
question
may
a
state
segregate
voter
by
race
in
the
drawing
of
congressional
district
lines?
at
the
same
time,
it
presents
another
question,
may
a
state
by
its
silence,
by
its
refusal
to
introduce
any
proof
whatsoever
justify
such
segregation
as
a
matter
of
law?
i
have
phrased
this
latter
question
in
this
way
because
the
appellants
contend
that
in
creating
new
york
counties,
manhattan
islands,
if
you
will,
four
congressional
districts
in
1961
when
the
legislature
cut
down
the
number
of
districts
previously
apportioned
to
manhattan
at
6-to-4.
the
legislature
created
two
of
those
four
districts
that
were
racially
gerrymandered.
one,
a
virtually
all
white
district,
and
one,
a
virtually
all
negro
and
for
the
puerto
rican
district,
and
not
only
were
these
districts
racially
gerrymandered
but
as
we
prove
below
and
as
i
shall
review
for
this
court
momentarily,
they
were
racially
gerrymandered
by
the
legislature
in
a
way
which
presented
the
maximum
so
to
speak
and
that
the
legislature
could
not
possibly
have
created
districts
in
this
particular
urban
area
which
would
have
been
any
more
segregated.
the
state
has
been
absolutely
silent
as
to
the
background
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
legislative
history.
the
districting
statute
was
enacted
in
1961
in
an
extraordinary
or
special
session
of
the
legislature
convened
one
day
when
the
bill
was
laid
on
the
desks
of
the
legislators
or
one
evening
i
should
say
and
enacted
the
next
morning
and
signed
by
the
governor
that
day.
no
hearings,
no
debate,
there
was
a
vote
but
that
was
all,
so
that
that
sheds
no
light.
therefore,
we
had
to
prove
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
portion
of
the
statute
we
challenge,
namely
the
portion
directed
toward
the
districting
of
manhattan
island,
we
had
purpose
and
effect
of
apportion
we
challenge.
we
had
to
prove
the
purpose
and
effect
i
should
say
by
analysis
and
inference.
and
we
submit
that
if
our
proof,
if
the
totality
of
our
proof,
if
you
will,
to
use
the
language
of
johnson
against
virginia.
if
the
totality
of
our
proof
is
not
deemed
sufficient
for
this
purpose,
it
would
mean
in
our
judgment
that
no
one
could
ever
prove
unconstitutional
racial
districting
in
any
urban
area
of
the
united
states.
and
we
also
submit
that
if
this
proof
that
i'm
about
to
discuss
does
not
prove
racial
districting,
in
the
case
of
manhattan
island,
then
it
proves
that
there
was
no
rational
basis.
it
proves
to
use
the
language
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
last
week
"crazy
quilt
districting",
no
rhyme
or
reason
districting,
because
i
submit
there
is
no
other
discernable
basis
for
this
districting
other
than
race.
now,
what
is
it
the
legislature
did
and
how
did
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i'm
suggesting
sir,
that
we
prove
the
racial
inference.
no
one
has
come
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
in
this
record.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes
sir,
i
eliminate
a
political
reason
and
i
think
we
could
--
we
could
also
demonstrate
and
perhaps
even
did
demonstrate
below
the
elimination
of
that
but
let's
come
back
to
that
mr.
justice
white
if
you
like
to
later.
the
question
is,
what
if
they
do
and
how
did
they
do
it?
well,
what
did
they
start
with?
they
started
that
the
will
where
they
only
contained
political
subdivision,
an
island,
new
york
county.
it's
not
a
very
complicated
configuration
really.
there
were
no
other
county
lines
or
rivers
or
boundaries
that
they
had
to
give
consideration
to
and
they
had
to
cut
it
into
four
parts
and
they
started
with
the
population
of
1,698,241
people.
a
quarter
--
a
quarter
of
that
would
be
approximately
424,000
and
cutting
it
into
four
parts,
they
were
confronted
of
course
with
one
fact
which
was
unusual,
and
that
is
that
approximately
40%
of
that
1,698,000
people
were
negroes
and
puerto
ricans.
now,
in
doing
the
carving
of
this
corpus,
they
took
a
very
delicate
scalpel
and
made
their
first
incision,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
in
the
creation
of
the
seventeenth
congressional
district
right
at
the
point
where
the
east
river
meets
14th
street.
this
is
the
point
of
the
first
incision.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
there
are
previous
operations,
yes
sir.
but
this
particular
seventeenth
district
was
never
started
at
that
point
before.
this
was
a
point
immediately
south
of
an
area
we
call
stuyvesant
town
and
peter
cooper
which
interestingly
enough
by
decision
of
our
court
of
appeals
in
1949
in
the
case
of
dorsey
against
stuyvesant
town
was
maintained
as
a
non-integrated
housing
project,
the
project
built
by
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
and
which
according
to
the
proof
in
the
record
obtained
23,000
people
of
whom
they're
only
105
non-whites
and
puerto
ricans.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
will
sir.
i
will
get
to
that.
i
have
overlays
which
will
show
the
--
the
--
the
lines,
the
additions,
collisions
and
changes.
they
then
went
along
here
and
twisted
and
turned
and
wind
and
wove
leaving
out
a
portion
here,
leaving
out
a
portion
here,
i
think
you
can
see
exactly
how
they
went
around
to
create
the
seventeenth
district
and
we
will
show
what
everyone
of
these
turns
and
twists
and
we
did
then
the
record
means
in
racial
terms.
until
they
ended
up
at
a
hundred
and
--
well
at
central
park,
the
line
here
and
those
that
the
justices,
if
it
please
the
court,
would
know
manhattan.
this
line
along
central
park,
between
72nd
street
and
110th,
is
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
park
so
it
contains
no
people,
it
merely
contained
the
park.
and
they
ran
it
up
along
that
eastern
boarder
of
the
park
until
110th
street.
the
east
--
well
the
western
border
of
the
park,
excuse
me,
the
eastern
border
of
central
park
west.
yes
mr.
justice
white,
the
eastern
border
of
central
park
west
to
110th
street,
where
they
ran
along
the
southern
border
of
110th
street
the
northern
border
in
the
park
against
obtaining
no
people.
now,
down
along
the
and
not
straight
across,
mind
you,
no.
but
down
along
the
eastern
border
of
the
park,
the
--
well
the
western,
it's
the
eastern
border
of
the
park,
the
west
side
of
5th
avenue
until
they
got
to
98th
street
and
then
started
this
step-like
configuration
and
bringing
back
into
the
river
and
back
to
the
point
of
place
of
beginning,
the
next
point
of
a
decision
with
a
scalpel
in
the
18th
congressional
district.
here
they
start
at
the
east
river
and
165th
street.
again,
not
in
the
northern
tip
or
any
place
else
but
they
cut
right
in
here,
twist
and
turn
around,
make
their
little
excised
here
for
washington
heights
and
st.
nicholas
terrace.
come
down
along
again
to
morningside
heights
but
now
down
behind
the
morningside
park,
if
you
will,
back
down
on
110th
and
conforming
to
the
border
of
the
seventeenth
as
it
was
originally
cut.
that
gave
them
two
congressional
districts.
there
were
two
left,
two
--
two
remaining,
they
drew
a
straight
line
across
86th
street
and
cut
the
two
remaining
districts
in
--
in
half.
not
quite
in
half
in
terms
of
population
but
86th
street
was
the
convenient
cross
town
street.
that's
the
way
manhattan
island
was
carved.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
these
two
around
all
around
the
westside
of
the
island
except
for
the
20th
and
also
above
165th
is
on
the
eastside
of
the
island.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
right.
and
of
course
the
seventeenth
goes
also
over
to
the
westside
for
certain
portions
although
the
bulk
of
it
is
on
the
eastside.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
the
wall
street
district
is
the
nineteenth,
this
area
below.
now,
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
oh
this
is
the
point
of
dispute,
the
attorney
general
and
i
had
for
quite
a
while.
this
i
maintain
is
the
harlem
ship
canal.
the
harlem
river
runs
around
here
and
the
harlem
ship
canal
was
dug
here.
the
attorney
general
says
that
despite
the
dive
of
creek
that
runs
around
here
and
that
was
not
the
harlem
river
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
this
is
manhattan
and
it
is
new
york
county,
that
little
tip
north
of
the
harlem
ship
canal.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
and
there's
no
part
of
the
bronx,
it
doesn't
go
outside
of
new
york
county.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
many
people
feel
that
the
harlem
ship
canal
above
baker
field
is
the
boundary
of
new
york
county.
it's
not
this
area
above
marble
hill.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
marble
hill.
now,
what
it
does
--
what
it
does
accomplish
by
the
creation
of
this
jagged
seventeenth?
they
excluded
from
the
seventeenth
97
%
of
the
negro
and
puerto
rican
population
of
manhattan
county,
and
gave
this
--
made
the
seventeenth
a
95%
all-white
district,
in
other
words,
the
population
of
the
seventeenth
that
is
negro
and
puerto
rican
this
approximately
5%
of
the
total.
the
eighteenth,
they
excluded
99.5%
of
the
island's
whites
and
this
district
is
86%
--
86.3%
negro
and
puerto
ricans.
interestingly
enough,
as
we'll
show
later,
the
population
as
i
said
before
of
one
quarter
of
the
island
would
be
a
million
--
it
would
be
424,000.
but
the
seventeenth
is
only
382,000,
43,000
short
of
the
average
of
one
quarter
from
the
district.
judge
moore
below
compared
it
with
the
statewide
average
but
when
we're
looking
for
the
inference
for
a
racial
discrimination
as
opposed
to
underrepresentation
and
overrepresentation;
i
submit
the
comparison
as
to
the
other
districts
on
the
island.
so
that
it
is
12%
smaller
than
the
18th.
it's
14%
smaller
than
the
20th
and
15.4%
smaller
in
population
than
the
19th.
as
a
result,
the
whites
in
here
have
their
vote
count
12-15%
more
than
the
votes
of
97%
of
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
those
other
three
districts.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
sir,
seventeenth
district
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
--
which
excludes
all
but
3%
of
the
island's
negroes
and
puerto
ricans,
is
12%
smaller
than
the
18th.
it
is
14%
smaller
than
the
20th
and
15.4%
smaller
than
the
19th
hence,
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i'm
not
attacking
here
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
it's
only
as
part
of
a
whole
picture
as
to
its
evidentiary
value
with
respect
to
--
to
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
statue
and
not
making
it
principally
and
underrepresentation
and
overrepresentation.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
if
there
were
no
racial
--
if
there
were
no
racial
considerations
here
sir,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
in
terms
of
population,
382,000
against
445,000.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
i
say
that
as
i
develop
the
racial
considerations
in
these
turns
and
twists,
i
suggest
that
when
i'm
finished
if
it's
not
raised,
what
is
it?
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
correct
sir.
the
disproportion
in
numbers
is
more
evidentiary
than
anything
else
although
it
--
it
does
exist.
if
this
court
were
to
find
at
some
future
date
that
there
must
be
a
closer
relationship
than
x%
for
purposes
of
equal
protection,
this
might
--
well
might
not
fall
within
it,
i
don't
know.
anyway,
this
is
what
they
did.
now,
of
course
it's
also
interesting
to
know
that
the
district,
the
old
seventeenth
had
had
only
260,000
people.
the
new
seventeenth,
182,000.
the
old
seventeenth
had
6.6%
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
and
now
by
the
addition
of
122,000
people,
the
percentage
dropped
16%
from
6.6
to
5.1
but
at
my
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
there
was
an
absolute
gain
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
--
of
1000
people
in
that
when
they
had
260,000
in
the
district,
there
were
9000
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
when
there
are
382,000
people,
there
are
10,000
negroes.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes.
that
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
add
122,000
people
in
this
island
where
40%
of
them
are
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
unless
you
added
them
the
way
they
did
with
that
as
to
increase
--
not
to
increase
at
all,
just
would've
been
and
physically
arithmetically
impossible.
now,
as
i
say
sir,
how
did
they
do
this?
first
of
all,
they
did
it
by
jigsawing
the
lines
and
ending
up
with
an
undersized
district
because
as
our
proof
show,
had
they
expanded
this
to
the
north
so
as
to
bring
it
up
to
the
average
for
the
island
of
approximately
425,000
people,
they
would've
tripled
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
the
district.
and
had
they
expanded
it
to
the
south,
they
would've
doubled
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
chinatown
is
--
is
much
south
of
that
sir.
they
would've
reached
--
they
would've
not
have
gone
as
far
as
chinatown
before
they
would
have
had
425,000.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
turn
now
here
to
a
chart
which
is
exhibit
4a
in
the
record
and
i
reprinted
in
the
--
in
the
record
which
was
prepared
for
apportion
of
the
island
and
was
prepared
on
the
basis
of
the
census
tracts.
the
census
tracts
having
been
obviously
available
to
the
legislature
because
this
is
the
only
way
on
which
you
can
compute
population
and
the
population
is
--
of
each
district
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
statute.
and
which
had
the
census
tracts
here
as
indicated
by
the
key
on
the
map.
and
you
can
quickly
see
sir
that
--
if
the
court
please,
that
was
75
to
100%
negro
and
puerto
rican
areas
up
for
along
110th
street.
what
would've
happened
had
they
expanded
it?
had
they
expanded
it
to
the
point
of
425,000
people
to
the
north?
as
i
say,
the
record
shows
they
would've
tripled
the
number
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
the
district
and
had
they
done
the
same
to
the
south?
they
would've
approximately
doubled
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
the
district.
and
had
they
expanded
it
on
the
west,
you
can
see
what
the
population
composition,
there
is.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
the
attorney
general
has
made
a
point
of
variability
to
come
down
to
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
there
are
two
problems
with
that
coming
down
to
--
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
added
any
people
because
it's
a
warehouse
an
area
with
no
population
and
the
other
is,
it
would've
created
a
dainty
paradox
through
the
--
through
the
19th
which
comes
around
below.
yes,
they
might've
taken
in
one
or
two
blocks
but
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
in
terms
of
--
of
total
population
but
still
would've
been
an
undersized
district.
the
attorney
general,
interestingly
enough,
has
made
his
brief
much
of
the
fact
than
he
did
in
the
trial
court
that
they
didn't
take
in
this
little
area
here
which
is
predominantly
white.
this
sort
of
what
we
have
called
the
"buffer
zone"
because
all
the
pressure
has
been
south
from
the
north
and
not
the
other
way
ethnically
but
on
further
investigation,
we
found
that
by
a
resolution
of
the
board
of
estimate
of
the
city
of
new
york
adopted
in
1959,
most
of
these
areas
was
to
be
condensed
for
a
federally
assisted
public
housing
project.
i
think
exhibit
7
of
the
record
shows
approximately
five
or
six
square
blocks
per
public
housing
project
of
the
type
which
traditionally
is
74
to
75%
negro
and
puerto
ricans,
so
they
were
aware
of
what
was
going
to
happen
to
this
area,
they
knew
that.
similarly,
in
preparing
this,
they
cut
some
census
--
they
cut
through
census
tracts.
they
cut
through
approximately
12
census
tracts
in
going
through
these
borders
rather
than
follow
the
outline
to
the
census
tracts.
and
on
the
analysis
of
the
areas
they
cut,
we
tried
that
on
the
border
between
the
17th
and
the
18th,
there
are
two
cut
census
tracts
and
the
percentage
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
the
excluded
portion
is
22.6%.
and
the
percentage
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
the
included
portion
is
4.5%
and
that
absolute
numbers
approximately
4
to
1
excluded
as
against
included
within
the
particular
census
tracts.
on
the
--
they
had
to
go
quite
a
bit
of
trouble
with
cuts
--
figures
computed
census
tracts.
somebody
did,
i
don't
know
who
in
the
legislature
did
but
someone
did.
and
similarly,
on
the
southern
border
between
the
--
or
the
border
between
the
17th
and
the
19th,
they
cut
10
census
tracts
and
in
that
instance,
the
percentage
inside
the
17th
is
approximately
11%
negroes
and
puerto
ricans,
outside
the
17th
approximately
20%
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
and
almost
3-to-1
or
two
--
two
and
a
half
to
one
in
absolute
numbers.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
the
census
tract
here
is
merely
an
arbitrary
counting
unit
determined
by
the
--
for
the
convenience
by
the
census
bureau.
but
anything
--
the
only
way
one
--
it's
the
only
way
they
count
and
when
you
want
the
population
figures,
you
quick
--
and
quickly
you
go
to
the
census
tracts.
when
you
want
to
refine
them,
you
can
go
to
the
enumeration
districts
and
get
the
breakdowns
of
the
census
tracts
but
if
you're
breaking
up
the
island's
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
it's
artificial.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
it's
artificial
but
since
the
--
the
legislature
did
say
in
joint
legislative
committee
document
print
--
reprinted
in
exhibit
b
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
--
that
the
census
figures
for
1960
were
used.
that
the
decennial
census
figures
were
used,
this
is
the
way
that
the
decennial
census
figures
are
expressed
and
i
think
we
can
assume
that
the
legislature
had
all
appropriated
information
before.
but
the
fact
is
on
these
cut
census
tracts,
what
we
--
the
refinements
end
up
showing
that
70%
of
the
non-white
population
in
the
cut
tracts
was
excluded
in
the
process
of
cutting
the
tracts,
only
30%
was
included.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
not
at
all
sir.
merely
that
the
population
is
the
--
is
the
basis.
this
is
how
you
determine
the
population
of
where
you
--
you
will
wiggle
and
squiggle
around
by
use
of
a
census
tract,
there's
no
other
way
you
can
do
it.
similarly,
on
the
whole
tracts,
they
are
generally
--
well,
i
think
in
every
instance
except
one.
the
number
or
the
percentage
is
higher
on
the
outside
than
it
is
on
the
inside.
the
only
place
where
that
is
not
true
was
in
the
two
census
tracts
of
34th
street
to
42nd
street
and
the
6th
and
8th
avenue
where
the
percentage
inside
is
higher
than
the
percentage
outside
--
but
this
is
a
very
sparsely
populated
area.
and
the
total
number
inside
as
against
outside
is
about
8-to-1
outside.
i
think
there
are
191
inside
and
about
a
thousand
or
so
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
outside.
the
only
one
place
where
they
left
was
only
very
little
explanation,
they
left
the
second
tract
to
the
high
--
negro
and
puerto
rican
census
tracts
inside
that
little
triangle
down
here
around
peter
coop
--
cooper,
i
guess
it
is
of
cooper
union,
excuse
me.
but
there
are
only
a
thousand
people
in
the
area
so
there're
only
300
negroes
and
puerto
ricans.
tract
c,
t-r-a-c-t.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
the
geographical
unit
determined
arbitrarily
by
the
bureau
of
the
census
for
purposes
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes,
they
differ
in
size.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
don't
know
what
the
census
bureau's
criteria
in
this
sir.
in
most
instances
as
you
can
see
in
the
city
of
new
york,
they
are
either
six
or
eight
square
blocks.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
substantially,
it's
the
same
size
of
area,
yes
sir.
now,
so
we
see
what
they
did
with
the
cut
tracts
and
so
forth.
we
also
look
and
see
what
they
did
on
these
--
in
its
portable
loops
and
you
take
this
with
the
stuyvesant
county,
for
instance
this
one's
interesting.
here
we
have
a
district
with
only
382,000
people,
well
undersized.
here
is
an
area
adjacent
containing
and
--
and
logically
contiguous
to
it,
containing
6800
people
with
only
of
what
the
district
is
up
to
39
--
390,000
but
this
area
is
12.2%
negro
and
puerto
rican
and
this
area
is
excluded
for
this
little
--
otherwise,
inexplicable
loop.
and
in
every
one
of
these
loops
as
i
said,
you'll
find
that
the
percentage
and
number
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
outside
is
much
higher
that
it
is
inside.
now
sir,
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
--
i
have
--
have
found
that
absolutely
impossible
mr.
justice
harlan
to
come
up
with
more
stark
percentages.
we
tried
several
neutral
ways
and
we
also
tried
several
discriminatory
ways
and
it
is
absolutely
impossible.
first
of
all
--
you
could
do
it
--
excuse
me.
you
could
do
it
if
you
made
the
seventeenth
smaller
numerically
than
it
is
now.
yes,
if
you
--
if
you
made
the
disparity
even
greater
so
that
you
reduced
the
size
of
the
seventeenth
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
--
to
300,000,
you
clearly
could
do
it.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
and
may
i
say
sir
a
little
further.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
sir
one
might
--
one
might
thinks
so
except
for
some
of
the
decisions
that
were
made.
the
court
below
was
obviously
troubled
by
that.
after
the
silence
of
the
appellees
and
the
failure
to
introduce
evidence,
they
asked
whether
we
would
stipulate
as
to
the
political
figures
and
we
submitted
a
memorandum
in
--
to
the
court
in
response
which
is
not
reprinted
in
the
record
here
but
as
part
of
the
clerk's
original
record
filed
in
this
court.
original
record
page
numbers
516
to
530,
which
is
in
the
clerk's
office,
if
any
of
you
are
interested,
in
which
we
maintain
first
that
it
was
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
our
case
that
the
burden,
if
it
were
political
districting,
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
come
forward
and
say
so
and
to
sustain
it.
and
in
the
face
of
the
proof
that
we
submitted
as
to
racial
classification,
the
strongest
possible
burden
should
be
placed
upon
the
state
to
come
in
and
explain
it
whether
it's
political
or
economic
or
whatever
it
may
be,
that
there
is
no
way
for
plaintiffs
to
show
segregation
and
racial
classification
except
by
these
numbers
and
figures.
we
can't
get
behind
the
heads
of
the
--
the
200
legislators
to
find
what
they
had
in
mind
but
they
had
available
to
them,
the
legislative
clerks
and
the
committee
clerks
who
drew
these
maps.
if
they
were
willing
to
come
in
and
testify
was
drawn
on
political
grounds,
i
--
it
may
--
we
may
still
argue
was
unconstitutional
but
we
would
have
a
right
to
test
that
hypothesis.
why
is
the
state
of
new
york
entitled
to
an
assumption
of
constitutionality
because
it's
political
whereas
if
i
presented
these
figures
from
the
state
of
mississippi
or
some
other
place,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
would
arise?
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes
sir
and
i
think
on
the
totality
of
proof,
i'd
proved
it
and
if
they
want
to
come
in
and
show
that
there
was
some
constitutional
basis
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
think
i'd
proved
the
case
sir
and
a
way
with
no
--
there
was
no
defense
on
that
basis.
i
think
i
proved
the
case.
but
interestingly
enough,
getting
back
to
that
request
of
stipulation,
we
furnished
there,
we
said
the
voting
figures
--
told
the
court
we
thought
the
voting
figures
were
irrelevant
because
voting
figures
vary
from
year
to
year
based
upon
the
personalities
of
the
candidates
and
the
issues
and
also
some
other
factors.
but
we
did
furnished
enrollment
figures,
party
affiliation
figures
and
they're
on
filing
the
clerk's
office
and
the
stuyvesant
town
area
is
better
than
2-to-1
democratic
by
enrollment
and
it's
higher
percentage
of
a
democratic
as
against
republican
enrollment
than
the
adjacent
area.
the
only
difference
i
can
find
between
those
two
areas
is
the
percentage
--
is
the
percentage
variation
and
race.
and
it
similarly,
you
check
a
lot
of
these
areas
where
there
are
exclusions
and
inclusions.
there's
no
basis
on
political
affiliation,
on
political
enrollment
which
is
the
only
true
test
of
political
affiliation
but
i'd
submit
sir
that
those
are
irrelevant
to
the
purposes
of
this
case
because
the
state
is
unwilling
to
come
forward
and
say
that
was
the
basis.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
no
one's
been
knocked
out
of
voting
and
that
you
can't
go
into
a
voting
booth
but
if
i'm
a
--
a
negro
living
in
--
in
this
district,
the
nineteenth,
it
takes
a
lot
more
votes
to
elect
the
congressman
than
it's
done
for
the
right
fellow
living
in
the
seventeenth.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
numbers
in
a
fifteenth
amendment
sense,
sir.
i
think
there's
an
abridgment
here.
i'm
raising
the
question
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
racial
classification.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
think
that
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
is
harm,
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
and
in
this
instance,
i
think
--
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
douglas'
statement
in
baker
against
carr
sir
that
racial
classification
of
voters
is
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
if
that's
what
gomillion
against
lightfoot
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
correct,
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
the
other
is
the
fact
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
the
other
is
in
this
instance,
the
fact
that
they've
been
excluded
from
an
area
in
which
the
--
the
voting
power
of
a
person
is
15%
higher
than
it
is
in
this
area.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that's
on
numbers
but
that's
an
abridgment
i
maintain
of
--
of
--
of
voting
power.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
--
that
is
correct
sir
and
if
i
may
go
on
with
my
proof
sir,
i
think
i'll
also
show
that
they
were
jammed-in
the
way
which
deprive
them
of
--
of
representation
in
other
ways
as
well
because
we
also
tested,
we
also
tested
this
statute
by
referring
to
see
how
it
could
be
drawn.
if
you
follow
from
the
start
of
the
northern
tip
of
the
island
and
it's
worked
this
way
down
until
he
got
the
425,000
and
did
that
again
and
drew
a
line
--
and
did
that
again
and
drew
a
line
and
those
are
contained
in
exhibits
6a
b
and
c
of
the
record
in
which
we
did
it
in
three
different
ways
and
there
was
--
interestingly
enough,
in
every
single
way,
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
would
constitute
a
majority
approximately
60%
of
at
least
one
district.
in
one
of
the
ways,
they
would
constitute
a
majority
in
at
least
two
districts
and
in
the
other
way
while
they
would
constitute
a
majority
in
only
one
district,
they
would
have
five
to
six
times
the
voting
strength
in
representation
in
all
of
the
other
districts.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
correct
sir.
and
destroyed
their
influence
in
the
other
districts
in
the
process.
and
i
might
say
also
is
tiny,
the
possibilities
of
rival
leadership
developing.
the
possibilities
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
negro
congressman
or
more
than
one
spokesman
for
the
negro
community
and
i
submit
that
may
be
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
have
some
interveners
in
the
case.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no
sir.
i
have
--
i
advocate
neutral
lines.
i
have
not
advocated
anything
but
neutral
lines
and
i
say
if
the
lines
are
drawn
neutrally
and
that's
the
way
it
falls
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
for
instance,
if
using
criteria
such
as
geographical
boundaries,
equal
population,
geometrical
lines,
you
ended
up
with
a
district
that
was
almost
all
colored,
i
would
not
say
that
this
had
had
violated
the
constitution.
but
where
you
make
their
district
larger
than
the
white
district
in
terms
of
numbers
where
you
go
out
of
your
way
to
--
to
--
to
weave
and
turn
so
that
you
jam
the
bulk
of
them
into
a
district
and
where
you
--
you
deliberately
draw
lines
or
purposefully
draw
a
line,
then
i
say
you
--
you've
violated
the
constitution.
when
i
talk
about
neutral
lines
sir,
what
we
did
as
i've
said
here
for
instance
exhibit
6a,
we
started
with
the
tip
of
the
island
and
we
counted
down
and
we
reached
the
census
tracts
with
approximately
425,000
people.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
point
is
out
the
--
at
125th
street
and
that
district
--
that
district
turns
out
to
be
59.1%
negro
and
puerto
rican
and
then
for
the
--
we
just
drew
a
--
did
the
same
thing
up
from
the
south
and
we
ended
up
with
the
district
that
was
22.3%
negro
and
puerto
ricans.
and
then
we
drew
a
line
down
here
to
preserve
the
concept
of
eastside
and
westside
to
some
extent
that
you
have
in
the
present
district
and
while
this
district
turned
out
to
be
only
9.5%
negro
and
puerto
rican,
approximately
twice
what
it
is
in
the
present
17th.
this
district
turned
out
to
be
--
excuse
me,
i'm
on
the
wrong
map
here.
this
district
--
yes,
this
district
turned
out
to
be
58.9%
negro
and
puerto
rican
so
that
you
had
two
districts
with
an
excess
of
one
--
one
with
59%
negro
and
puerto
rican,
the
other
58.9%
negro
and
puerto
rican
and
still
the
3rd
--
the
4th
district
within
quantum
was
twice
the
percentage
of
that
--
the
present
17th.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
1961
sir,
november
of
1961.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
the
republican
parties
control
the
legislature
in
new
york's
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
let
me
tell
you
sir,
politics
had
something
to
do
with
it
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot
too,
because
where
you
--
where
you
have
competing
interests.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
where
you
have
competing
interests,
you
have
different
votes.
but
let
me
tell
you,
sure
maybe
there's
--
there's
a
--
there's
a
racial
characteristic
that
i
think
anybody
knowing
new
york
politics
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
don't
think
this
is
because
of
a
two-party
fight
sir.
we're
attacking
a
district
here
that's
the
18th
that
is
democratic
as
well
as
attacking
the
17th
which
is
republican.
we
say
both
those
lines
were
drawn
wrong
because
one
is
an
all-negro
district
and
is
an
all-white
district.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
is
jamming
in
the
race
into
one
--
jamming
the
negro
race
into
the
18th
so
as
to
provide
the
maximum
number
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
one
district
and
to
deprive
them
of
influence
in
the
rest
of
the
county;
that
was
the
purpose.
now,
we
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
sir
this
benign
code
of
concept
has
been
--
has
been
raised
here
by
the
--
the
interveners
and
their
--
and
their
answer
when
they
said
that
that
--
this
is
the
reason
they
wanted
to
intervene
because
we're
--
well
destroy
their
control
of
the
district
and
it's
been
raised
by
the
--
by
the
state.
first
of
all,
i
think
this
concept
of
--
of
benefit
to
the
community
was
first
eliminated
by
the
court
as
a
defense
to
the
constitution
--
unconstitutionality
in
buchanan
against
warley,
as
far
back
as
1917.
and
i've
here
this
--
this
concept
of
benefit
to
the
negroes
argued
in
every
single
racial
classification
case
that's
come
before
this
court
since.
i
don't
think
that
this
represents
a
constitutional
theory
upon
which
we
can
rely
at
this
stage
of
development
of
the
--
of
the
law
in
this
field.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
i'm
relying
only
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i'm
relying
on
the
--
i'm
relying
sir
on
--
on
that
--
well
i
think
this
hurt
them
too
and
i'll
tell
you,
i
think
this
hurt
them
too.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
say,
not
only
is
the
benign
or
benevolent
approach
not
--
in
my
judgment,
not
a
good
defense.
it's
one
which
the
state
did
deny
the
plea
to
approve
but
they've
now
come
into
this
court
contending
but
it's
against
the
fact.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
it
hurts
them
sir
because
it
puts
all
of
their
influence
in
one
district.
it
takes
90
--
it
takes
the
both
of
the
--
of
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
manhattan
and
it
puts
them
in
the
18th
congressional
district.
it
destroyed
their
ability
to
influence
the
election
of
a
congressman
or
what
he
may
do
in
the
17th
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
right
and
it
dilutes
their
ability
to
influence
congressmen
in
the
two
other
districts.
if
those
lines
had
not
been
drawn
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no
sir.
my
argument
--
my
argument
is
to
permit
the
natural
result
of
whatever
population
dispersal
there
may
be
on
that
island
to
come
about
without
drawing
the
lines
so
as
to
herd
the
both
of
the
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
into
one
district
and
to
exclude
them
in
another.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
they
haven't
passed
a
law
that
requires
them
to
live
in
certain
district.
they've
passed
a
law
which
requires
them
to
vote
in
a
certain
district
by
drawing
the
--
these
crooked
lines.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
that's
true
sir
but
where
the
--
where
the
purpose
and
effect
of
these
crooked
lines
is
to
create
a
racial
classification,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional
in
the
lines
of
cases
that
this
court
has
developed.
and
i
--
i
think
that
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
--
the
--
the
state
has
come
in
with
this
benign
quote
of
theory
which
is
i
say
is
contrary
to
the
fact.
they've
also
come
in
with
a
--
with
a
--
an
interesting
theory
on
the
standard
of
proof
that's
required.
they
say
they
came
in
with
commendable
candor
of
course,
although
no
defense
below.
they
came
in
with
commendable
candor
to
this
court
in
its
brief
and
they
said
that,
number
one,
they're
entitled
to
--
to
district
on
a
racial
basis.
they're
entitled
to
do
so.
and
number
two
they
said,
"you
can't
avoid
doing
so."
and
number
three
they
said,
"even
if
this
court
doesn't
agree
with
those
concepts,
all
we
found
is
the
corpse,
the
footprints
and
the
fingerprints.
we
don't
have
an
eyewitness,
we
don't
have
anybody
to
say
this
is
what
they
deliberately
did."
and
although
mr.
galt
argued
very
persuasively
that
motive
was
irrelevant
in
the
wnca
case,
he
argues
that
motive
is
--
is
necessary
as
per
element
of
proof.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
sir
i
--
i
--
i
think
that
if
--
if
the
state
did
it
for
that
reason,
then
they
should
have
the
burden
of
proof.
in
other
words,
if
we
have
proved
that
it
was
done
on
a
racial
basis
and
the
state
says,
"yes,
it
was
done
on
a
racial
basis
but
it
was
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
minority
race."
then
where
racial
classifications
are
going
to
creep
into
the
law,
the
burden
of
proof
should
shift
to
them
and
the
strongest
standard
possible
should
be
imposed
upon
them
to
show
that
this
was
in
fact
the
case.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
think
it
would
be
sir
but
mr.
justice
black
said
he
though
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
useful
notion.
i
don't
know
--
maybe
he
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
i
don't
know
where
there
was
his
intention
to
say
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
do
not
say
it's
constitutional.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
it
might
well
be
sir,
i
still
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
they've
--
they
have
--
they
have
come
in
where
they
said,
"we
don't
have
the
eyewitnesses,"
as
i
said.
and
this
is
sort
of
more
or
less
the
vice
of
decisive
opinion
below.
we
feel
that
judge
murphy
in
his
dissent
below
is
absolutely
right
when
he
said,
"having
proved
all
of
the
things
we
proved,
what
more
need
plaintiffs
prove?"
that
we
have
proved
the
prima
facie
case
and
we
had
proved
subtle
discrimination
in
an
urban
area.
but
judge
feinberg
in
the
controlling
opinion
said
that
"the
burden
of
proof
on
plaintiffs
in
a
racial
case
is
a
very
difficult
burden
because
we
might
--
must
not
only
show
that
the
--
a
reasonable
inference
of
racial
classification.
and
we
must
show
that
it's
the
only
available
inference."
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
could
infer
from
looking
at
these
maps
that
the
classification
was
made
on
economic
and
social
grounds."
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
testify
to
the
existence
of
economic
and
social
differences
dictating
the
--
the
lines
of
these
districts.
and
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
know
of
no
racial
classification
situation
where
you
won't
find
economic
and
social
differences.
if
economic
and
social
difference
that
would
justify
racial
--
racial
classification,
i
think
we
would
be
walking
all
the
way
back
not
until
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
plessy
against
ferguson
but
to
the
majority
opinion.
now,
with
the
permission
of
the
court
here,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
interested
in
this
dissent
of
this
argument.
i
won't
devote
much
time
to
it
because
as
i
read
--
heard
this
argument,
what
he
said
was,
"if
segregation
had
been
proved
here
to
the
point
where
i
couldn't
deny
it,
i
wouldn't
be
here,"
but
under
the
circumstances,
i'm
here
to
tell
you
that
i
like
segregation
in
the
18th
congressional
district
because
that's
how
--
the
way
we
become
leaders
in
the
18th
congressional
district.
that's
the
way
we
became
--
we
as
intervenors
became
leaders.
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
the
rest
of
the
community
or
the
individual
rights
or
the
rights
of
the
rest
of
the
group
and
that's
the
whole
theory
of
this
--
the
whole
problem
with
this
benign
code
of
concept.
whom
does
it
advantage
and
whom
does
it
disadvantage?
and
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
is
correct
sir,
but
as
we
also
showed
by
the
use
of
the
neutral
lines,
this
fact
means
that
there
will
always
be
a
majority
of
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
in
one
congressional
district.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
--
that
is
correct
sir.
but
no
matter
how
this
population
shifts,
i
submit,
that
with
the
40%
of
the
population
of
manhattan
being
negro
and
puerto
rican,
if
we
have
four
congressional
districts,
it
becomes
well
nigh
impossible
not
to
have
very
substantial
influence
and
the
proof
of
their
influence
sir
without
this
benign
need
to
--
to
gerrymander
is
the
fact
that
since
1953,
the
one
single
constituency
officer
in
the
city
of
--
in
new
york
county,
manhattan
has
been
a
negro.
the
negro
borough
president
of
manhattan
who's
elected
since
1953
because
of
this
40%
situation
so
that
you
don't
need
the
jam
negroes
into
one
area
in
order
to
make
this
advantage,
give
them
this
disadvantage.
i
submit
further
that
this
is
an
unimaginable
standard
and
one
which
if
the
courts
were
ever
to
get
into
would
become
complete
--
make
a
complete
morass
of
the
judicial
--
install
complete
morass
in
the
judicial
system.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
right.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
have
no
problem.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
have
no
problem
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
could
look
at
those
lines
and
say
these
are
what
i
called
neutral
colorblind
lines
and
this
is
the
way
it
works
out
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
to
be.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well
sir,
i
think
in
a
racial
classification
case,
it's
no
more
necessary
that
i
vitiate
those
theories
than
i
vitiate
them
that
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
plaintiffs
in
johnson
against
virginia
to
come
in
and
prove
that
the
distinctions
in
that
courtroom
were
not
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
people
on
the
left
side
are
less
than
a
$1,000
a
year
and
the
people
on
the
right
are
--
side
earn
more
than
a
$1,000
a
year.
there
are
many
possibilities.
am
i
supposed
to
vitiate
the
fact
that
maybe
there
are
more
gasoline
stations
in
one
district
than
another
or
more
green
houses
or
blue
houses
or
yellow
houses.
i
don't
know
there
are
a
lot
of
other
available
inferences
theoretically
and
once
i've
shown
the
racial
classification,
i
say
this
burden
shifts
and
the
state
must
come
forward
to
explain
what
the
real
reason
was.
now,
mr.
justice
white
asked
about
the
former
jagged
lines.
there
are
explanations
to
that.
i
think
anybody
in
those
new
york,
those
at
this
particular
area
has
changed,
the
long
east
river
drive
and
eastern
avenue.
this
was
jagged
at
one
point,
it's
not
jagged
now.
the
racial
composition
is
good.
i
might
point
out
that
mr.
galt
benefits
that
--
i
may
point
out
that
for
the
benefits
of
the
court,
excuse
me,
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
this
area
that
was
dropped
is,
as
he
said,
50%
negro
and
puerto
rican,
the
relevance
of
it
being
a
mount
sinai
hospital
was
nil
because
it
was
mount
sinai
hospital
before.
and
as
far
as
the
history
of
the
county
is
concerned,
these
districts
were
cut
in
parallel
lines
as
you'll
see
from
defendant's
exhibit
c,
i
believe
it
is.
in
1911,
when
the
population
of
the
county
was
2,300,000
and
there
were
only
600
--
or
excuse
me
60,000
negroes,
and
in
1921,
when
the
population
of
the
negroes
was
small,
parallel
lines,
no
need
for
it.
these
kinds
of
line
started
to
develop
in
1941
when
the
population
of
the
county
was
1,900,000
and
we
had
300,000
negroes.
we
don't
have
a
separate
figure
for
puerto
ricans
because
they
didn't
take
separate
figures
for
the
census
at
that
time,
that's
when
jagged
lines
developed.
and
if
they
were
going
to
build
on
historical
basis,
why
was
it
that
instead
of
adding
this
area,
they
didn't
add
the
area
that
used
to
be
in
the
17th.
you
know,
it
used
to
go
up
along
between
central
park
and
western
columbus
avenue
all
the
way
to
97th
street
up
to
1941,
when
they
dropped
that
out,
because
as
you
can
see
the
composition
of
the
map,
this
was
a
much
more
preferable
area.
wherever
they
had
the
choice,
they
made
that
kind
of
choice.
if
they
were
straightening
lines,
why
not
straighten
it
along
with
the
northern
border
or
along
the
park
in
110th
street
and
equalize
the
size
of
the
district,
why
not?
they
must
tell
us.
we
can't
be
expected
to
rebut
every
available
inference.
there
are
a
myriad
of
inferences
and
this
kind
of
burden
cannot
be
placed
upon
plaintiffs
in
a
segregation
case.
it
would
mean
that
you
would
just
never
could
prove
segregation
because
you
are
never
going
to
catch
the
eyewitness
from
the
legislature.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
that's
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
well,
in
the
--
in
terms
of
these
steps
sir,
as
i
said
in
the
old
district,
the
steps
were
contrived
because
this
area
has
negroes
and
puerto
ricans.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes
they
basically
drew
across
here
but
they
still
have
steps
up
here
and
it's
assonantly
this
step
mister
--
or
justice
white
maybe
interesting
to
you
because
this
one
that
this
two
block
area
that
was
draft
that
mr.
irving
galt
refers
to
as
mount
sinai
hospital
was
two
to
one
republican
in
enrollment
so
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't
have
included
that
one
in
the
district
if
the
motivation
was
political.
but
the
point
is
this
is
the
difficulty
with
all
of
these
so-called
available
inferences.
why
is
new
york
entitled
to
have
us
rebut
such
inferences?
it
wouldn't
be
available
at
--
to
them
in
other
states.
this
question
wouldn't
arise
on
this
proof
and
i
said
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
yes
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
sir,
in
the
segregated
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
in
a
segregated
--
in
a
segregated
situation,
vested
rights
develop
in
leadership
groups.
and
it
is
sometimes
convenient
for
a
white
group
to
service
the
negro
leadership
and
vice-versa
and
that
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
mr.
sandifer's
argument
in
this
benign
coded
theory
and
it
was
very
easy
to
make
this
arrangement
on
(inaudible)
the
negroes
into
the
18th
and
giving
at
all
white
district
to
somebody
else,
perhaps
not
the
course
enough
lack
of
political
difficulty
for
someone,
i
don't
know
but
nevertheless,
i
don't
know
what
their
purpose
was.
they
classified
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
don't
know
the
motives
sir.
i
am
unable
to
determine
motives
and
i
don't
know
that
motive
is
constitutionally
relevant
in
this
instance.
certainly,
as
mr.
galt
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
let
me
say
one
other
thing
sir,
as
i
showed
from
our
--
if
you
find
exhibit
6
(a)
or
6
(b)
and
incidentally
mr.
galt
makes
the
point
about
that
that
one
of
the
districts
would
have
had
only
9.5
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
instead
of
the
5%,
in
that
situation
where
one
district
had
9.5
almost
twice
as
many
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
percentage
wise
as
we
have
in
the
17th,
you
would
have
two
districts
with
almost
60%
negroes
and
puerto
ricans
and
that
both
may
well
have
been
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
make
certain
that
there
was
only
one
negro
and
puerto
--
or
puerto
rican
congressman
from
manhattan.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no,
,my
suggestion
is
that
what
they
produced
was
something
that
they
wanted
to,
no
negro
influence
in
the
17th
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
--
and
only
one
negro
congressman
in
manhattan.
because
by
arranging
at
that
way
sir,
there
would
only
be
one
negro
congressman
from
manhattan
where
is
if
you
drew
the
line
across
in
parallels
with
equal
size
districts,
you
would
have
two
districts
at
60%
negro
and
puerto
rican.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
it
wouldn't
get
to
the
17th
but
it
would
--
but
it
would
mean
if
i
get
to
somebody
else,
i
don't
know
sir
that's
the
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
it's
political,
it's
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
they
want
to
avoid
two
negro
congressmen
instead
of
one,
yes
sir
you
might
say
it's
political
because
they
are
talking
about
congressmen
instead
of
visitors
to
a
courtroom
or
a
golf
course
but
they
are
avoiding
two
negroes
instead
and
having
one
instead
and
i
don't
see
that
that
makes
any
difference
between
the
courtroom
and
the
golf
course,
excuse
me
sir
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
alright
sir
that's
traditional.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
there's
probably
one
--
one
problem
with
that.
the
percentage
of
democrats,
they
were
all
democrats,
in
this
new
17th
that
they
created
is
much
higher
than
it
was
in
the
old
17th.
not
just
numerically
higher
because
they
added
voters;
they
added
more
people,
but
it's
percentage
wise
higher.
this
stuyvesant
town
area
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
we'll
go
--
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no
sir,
we'll
give
you
those
figures
too.
they
wouldn't
have
you
see
because
you
don't
have
as
much
--
that
the
higher
--
as
higher
percentage
necessarily
in
your
--
in
your
enrollment,
but
the
point
is
that
had
gone
in
my
direction,
they
would
have
not
picked
up
proportionately
anymore
democrats.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
going
straight
north.
they
would
not
have
picked
up
proportionately
more
democrats
than
they
did
in
stuyvesant
town,
in
terms
of
enrollment,
in
terms
of
enrollment.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
in
terms
of
votes.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so
and
certainly
not
well
but
i
don't
know
or
were
no
findings
of
fact
in
the
court
below.
mr.
justin
n.
feldman
sir
the
--
in
order
that
you'll
agree
with
me,
i
think
if
you
would,
would
you
disagree
with
judge
feinberg's
only
available
inference
test
and
the
inference
of
the
economic
and
social
classification
that
he
made
which
was
unsupported
by
the
record
which
i
think
you
can
re
--
review
de
novo.
it
would,
it
would
require
a
reversal.
thank
you
very
much.
