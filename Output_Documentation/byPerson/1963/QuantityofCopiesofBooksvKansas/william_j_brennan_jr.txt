justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
fleishman,
what
went
to
the
judge
before
the
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
and
did
the
judge
read
the
seven?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
think
he
had
to
do,
in
other
words,
find
actual
obscenity
by
reading
the
whole
book
before
he
issued
a
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
nothing
related
to
probable
cause
with
the
five?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
speaking
only
the
seven.
i
happen
to
think
you
have
a
quite
a
case
on
the
rest
of
it,
so
on
the
seven.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
we
said
anything
anywhere,
particularly
in
marcus,
would
support
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
of
course
in
marcus
the
judge
hadn't
seen
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
clearly
enough
in
this
case
there
is
before
us
three
questions,
where
the
only
purpose
of
the
copies,
if
you
will,
of
the
book,
is
this
court,
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
got
to
say
do
we
not,
whether
anything
left
in
reading
the
whole
book
and
making
a
constitutional
judgment
final?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
there
has
to
be
a
whole
trial
before
the
search
warrant
can
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
you
don't
know
whether
it
be
a
whole
trial,
how
far
we
have
to
go
with
this
in
the
united
states
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
the
issue
of
the
warrant
and
then
that
has
to
be
followed
with
another
adversary,
full
trial,
would
it
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
forgotten
(inaudible)
procedures
this
is
the
–
whether
it
is
or
not
i'm
not
sure,
a
withdrawal
from
circulation
completely
for
some
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
thinking
about
the
statue,
the
new
york
statue,
i
forgot
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
marcus
statute
was
within
5
or
20,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
not
less
than
10.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
fleishman
would
you
say
that
to
those
24
titles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
have
gone
through
all
the
so
called
hearing
on
the
merits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
you
still
be
here
attacking
the
validity
of
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
in
24
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
was
that
31
and
7,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
it
was
24
and
seven.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
31,
whatever
it
is,
whatever
it
was,
the
judge
had
not
read,
but
looked
at
it
fully,
whatever
was
it
he
did,
before
he
granted
the
warrant.
as
to
those,
no
matter
what
did
happen
on
the
hearing
on
the
merits
wouldn't
you
be
here
contending
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
order
had
to
be
quashed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
he
would
be
here
with
the
20
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
some
of
the
arguments
here
suggested
that
at
least
these
judges,
setting
behind
this
bench
are
going
to
have
further
business
reading
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
31
books
here
by
the
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
where
the
distributor
got
25
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fleishman
i
am
still
confused
on
figures,
you
keep
up
with
that
31
books.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
31
independent
of
the
seven
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
six.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
total
number
is
31,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
found
only
31.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
–
i
just
want
to
get
this
much
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
31,
the
point
you're
not
making
is
31,
include
the
six
the
judge
read.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
on
the
premise,
you
might
be
wrong
as
the
–
on
your
market
point
that
the
six
the
judge
read,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
even
if
you're
wrong,
if
the
warrant
that's
sustainable
as
to
the
six,
you
would
still
make
the
warrant
point
as
to
the
24.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
don't,
but
if
you
are
wrong
on
six,
you
still
make
the
same
arguments
on
and
the
warrant
point
on
25.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
it
develop
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
it
develop
and
see
there
is
an
nterchangeability?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
identical?
titles
of
books
he
didn't
see?
isn't
there
an
issue
here
for
us
to
decide,
we
have
to
decide
whether
even
as
to
those
six
there
is
an
unconstitutional
prior
restraint
in
taking
those
six
out
of
circulation
before
there
has
been
an
adversary
determination
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
have
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
don't
we
have
to
decide
here
maybe
you
are
right,
one
it
is
not
required,
but
even
as
to
those
six,
isn't
the
issue
before
us
whether
without
an
advisory
determination
of
obscenity,
taking
these
books
those
six
out
of
circulation
was
a,
an
unconstitutional
prior
restrain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
we
find
that
it
is
as
to
the
sex,
then
of
course
there
is
the
others
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
that
case
mr.
fleishman,
you
showed
it
yesterday
that
new
york
has
said
that
you
cannot
under
their
kingsley
statute
take
a
book
out
of
the
bookseller's
window
until
there
has
first
been
an
adversary
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
27?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
of
them
you
know
follow
that
new
york
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
attorney
general
in
this
very
--
well
how
did
you
get
hold
of
those
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
you
get
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
but
those
that
you
presented
to
the
judge,
the
six
titles,
where
did
you
get
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
--
having
the
two
either
by
information
or
indictment
you
could
have
properly
proceeded
against
the
distributor
of
those
things
and
prosecuted
them,
could
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
this,
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
i
could
have
gotten
--
who
publishes
the
--
is
that
grove
press?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say
it's
grove
press,
i
suppose
grove
press
has
a
fly
leaf
for
a
number
of
titles
at
the
back
of
it
there,
some
state
courts
have
held
at
least
that
tropic
of
cancer
is
obscene.
if
that
came
into
your
state
could
you
go
in
and
just
showing
the
judge
tropic
of
cancer
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordered
to
seize
all
the
other
titles
of
grove
press?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
they
are.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
the
attorneys
general
of
those
states
where
they
held
it
is,
florida,
new
york
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
similar
fact
is
that
in
a
fly
leaf
with
tropic
of
cancer
appear
a
number
of
titles
published
by
grove
press,
lady
chatterley's
lover
and
a
couple
of
other
things.
now
merely
by
presenting
your
magistrate
tropic
of
cancer
and
maybe
whether
he
purses
it
or
read
it,
you
are
supposing
you
could
then
get
a
warrant
to
seize
all
grove
press
titles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
every
title
of
nightstand
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
perhaps
you
would
do
it
against
grove
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
long
was,
this
attorney
general
before
they
--
the
hearing
of
the
16th
day
after
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it's
your
statute
in
effect
prohibits
the
hearing
earlier
than
ten
days.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
ten
days
from
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
the
time
of
the
seizure
and
then
the,
all
the
proceedings
resulting
in
the
adjudication
of
obscenity
as
to
all
53
titles
or
whatever
number
we
are
dealing
with
here,
had
been
completed
within
six
days
after
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sixteen
days
from
the
date
of
seizure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
pretty
clear
mr.
attorney
general
that
your
argument
is
really
for
the
proposition
that
one
way
of
coping
with
this
filth
is
to
get
it
out
of
circulation
rather
than
just
to
prosecute
people,
prosecute
the
purveyors
of
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
maybe
one
thing
to
do
you
may
want
to
do
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
really
after
is,
they
follow
the
state
to
get
this
stuff
out
of
circulation
so
they
can't
sell
it
to
another,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
prosecute
perhaps
afterwards
but
you
surely
aren't
your
up
against
the
case
we
are
as
a
problem
of
whether
not
your
procedure
constitutes
prior
restraint?
we
can't
avoid
it,
can
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
need
to
scare
them
off
to
books
by
prosecuting
the
people
and
sending
them
to
jail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fleishman
before
you
begin,
did
you
find
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down
on
the
question,
i
just
ask
this
one
question.
i
take
it,
that
had
kansas
done
only
this,
had
they
taken
these
six
books,
given
you
an
adversary
hearing
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
and
then
had
--
without
taking
the
six
books
out
of
circulation
in
advance
of
you
getting
that
hearing,
and
you
then
got
a
hearing
and
there
had
been
a
determination
of
obscenity,
that
an
order
which
then
seized
--
directed
their
seizure
as
contraband,
on
that
point,
you
have
no
constitutional
objection.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right
i
know,
but
the
important
thing
is
on
the
prior
restraint
order
this
--
the
key
to
that
as
you
see
it
is
taking
these
books
out
of
circulation
before
there's
been
an
advisory
judicial
determination
of
obscenity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
as
to
the
other
24
whatever
--
53,
figures
confuse
me,
but
in
any
event
it
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
these
books,
i
take
it
that
if
they
had
got
a
warrant,
just
to
seize
one
copy
of
those
that
they
didn't
have,
to
bring
back
for
an
adversary
judicial
determination
without
taking
them
out
of
circulation,
you'd
give
me
the
same
answer,
that
constitutionally,
procedurally
perhaps
you
wouldn't
have
a
constitutional
objection.
