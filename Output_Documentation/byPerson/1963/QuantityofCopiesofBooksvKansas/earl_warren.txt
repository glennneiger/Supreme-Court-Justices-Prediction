appellants
versus
kansas.
you
have
--
you
are
reserving
the
remainder
of
your
time,
mr.
fleishman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
ferguson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
your
statute
adopted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
other
26
states,
were
they
recent
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mentioned
that
this
court
has
never
questioned
those
statutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
because
those
statutes
haven't
had
the
time
even
to
come
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general
was
the
dealer
in
this
case
prosecuted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
it's
easier
to
burn
books
than
it
is
to
prosecute
a
man
for
practicing
obscenity
in
the
selling
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that
the
danger
that
we
face
in
proceedings
of
this
kind?
wouldn't
you
avoid
your
constitutional
questions
if
you
prosecuted
this
man
for
practicing
obscenity,
and
tried
him
as
americans
are
tried
in
the
courts
rather
than
to
take
the
shortcut
of
naming
59
books
and
going
before
a
judge
ex-parte
and
getting
a
decree
permitting
you
to
burn
the
books
as
your
own
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
use
the
words
book
burning,
that
is
my
appellation,
but
to
yours
and
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
the
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fact
is
that
the
judge
didn't
peruse
them,
he
didn't
read
them,
he
saw
a
few
of
them,
saw
six
of
them
and
then
you
just
jumped
from
that
to
the
fact
that
well
everything
that's
published
by
these
same
people
must
be
of
the
same
nature,
therefore
we
can
proscribe
everything
these
people
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
the
judge
--
the
judge
who
permitted
you
to
go
and
take
the
59
books,
had
no
knowledge
of
what
was
in
those
books,
not
a
bit
of
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
how
about
the
other
53
that
he
didn't
see?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
did
he
know,
how
did
he
know
they
were
that
mirror
like?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
heard
some
arguments
in
this
court
on
this
same
subject,
that
at
least
one
of
shakespeare's
books
has
some
phases
in
it
that
might
be
considered
obscene.
do
you
mean
because
someone
might
come
to
that
conclusion
after
reading
one
volume
of
shakespeare
that
he
could
proscribe
everything
that
shakespeare
ever
wrote?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
concede
that
those
six
books
do,
how
about
the
other
53?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
get
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
--
have
you
prosecuted
anyone
in
kansas
for
violating
the
statute
of
obscenity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
prosecuted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
prosecuted
any
individual
in
kansas
for
obscenity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
$2
billion
business
around
this
country
i
suppose
a
sizable
portion
of
it
can
be
attributed
to
kansas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
if
that
is
true
why,
why
in
order
to
avoid
these
constitutional
questions
can't
you
prosecute
the
people
who
are
indulging
in
obscenity?
why
--
those
people
don't
want
to
go
to
jail
anymore
than
anyone
else
if
they
have
adequate
law
enforcement,
if
they
have
--
if
they
are
prosecuted
for
doing
this
thing,
can't
we,
can't
we
believe
that
that
can
be
stamped
out
or
almost
stamped
out
like
burglary,
and
robbery
and
other
crimes
are,
rather
than
to
take
shortcut
that
involves
all
these
constitutional
questions,
book
burning
and
all
the
rest
of
things
that
go
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
we
talk
about,
when
we
talk
about
suppressing
obscenity,
why
don't
the
law
enforcement
officers
do
their
job
and
prosecute
those
who
were
purveying
filth
throughout
the
country
instead
of
coming
on
to
this
court
continuously
on
cases
of
this
kind.
we've
had
practically
no
cases
in
this
court,
where
there
had
been
actual
prosecutions
for
obscenity
and
there
isn't
a
city
in
this
country
in
which
it
isn't
practiced
almost
with
impunity.
why
is
that
in
kansas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
several
means
of
law
enforcement
and
one
of
them
involves
very
serious
constitutional
questions
and
another
involves
none.
is
it
unreasonable
for
the
courts
to
ask
you
to
combine
with
the
one
that
does
involve
constitutional
questions,
the
one
that
does
not
in
order
to
protect
against
the
constitutional
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
sees
to
me
that
it's
just
so
simple,
if
you
really
want
to
put
obscenity
out
of
business,
it
seems
to
me
so
simple
to
do
what
mr.
justice
clark
said.
you
can
get
a
search
warrant
and
an
arrest
warrant
against
the
man
who
is
purveying
this
filth
and
you
can
prosecute
him
and
put
him
in
the
jail
at
the
same
time
that
your
--
you've
got
an
injunction
suit
pending
against
him
and
that
if
you
convict
him,
you
have
no
problem
at
all
with
your
injunction
and
the
suit.
you
can
take
all
the
volumes
out
of
circulation,
that
way
that
you
could
take
under
this
simple
short
cutting
system
which
you
use
i
suggest
because
it's
easy
and
the
other
is
a
little
more
difficult.
is
it
wrong
for
the
courts
to
hold
you
up
to
that
standard
in
order
to
avoid
this
kind
of
problems
that
you
bring
to
us
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i'm
being
pragmatic.
there
is
so
much
discussion
about
the
courts
not
fulfilling
their
obligations
in
protecting
against
obscenity.
i
wonder
if
that's
where
the
fault
lies.
here
in
the
great
state
of
kansas
you
had
one
case,
one
case
against
all
of
filth
that's
been
in
your
space,
where
every
prosecutor
in
the
state
could
prosecute
these
people
for
this,
you
could
have
any
number
of
injunction
proceedings
if
you
merely
put
those
people
in
jail
for
purveying
the
filth
and
proceeded
with
your
injunction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fleishman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
i
can
understand
mr.
fleishman
that
of
the
two
you
are
clients
would
rather
lose
their
books
and
go
to
jail
and
that's
exactly
the
point
that
i
was
making
that
from
a
standpoint
of
law
enforcement,
if
there
was
honest
law
enforcement
they
would
prosecute
these
people,
but
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
mere
fact
that
that
is
a
possibility
under
the
law
that
all
the
book
shops
are
going
to
close
anymore
than
all
--
than
the
stock
market
is
going
to
close
because
there
is
regulation
of
securities
and
anyone
who
sells
a
fraudulent
security
may
go
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
any
more
difficult
to
define
obscenity
legally
than
it
is
to
define
negligence
according
to
the
standards
of
what
a
reasonable
man
might
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
people
would
have
had
some
experience
with
sex
too
throughout
the
ages.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
jury
says
something
it
constitutes
negligence,
another
one
says
that
it
does
not
in
exactly
the
same
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we'll
have
to
get
the
rest
of
it
from
your
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
