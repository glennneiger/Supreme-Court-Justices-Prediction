justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
you
may
not
take
the
book
out
of
circulation
until
and
unless
there
has
been
a
full
constitutional
judgment
on
a
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
at
that
time
circulation
must
be
permitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you're
saying
that
you
can't
take
the
book
out
of
circulation
until
there
has
been
a
hearing,
but
you
can
take
a
person
out
of
circulation
before
he
has
had
a
hearing.
i
suppose
you
would
say
that's
a
difference
between
a,
i
believe
the
first
and
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
a
person
could
be
taken
out
of
circulation
on
an
ex
parte
on
a
warrant
that
is
secured
ex
parte.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
be
taken
out
of
circulation
for
a
moment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
there
is
any
really
a
real
substantial
question
about
the
structure
of
evidence?
let's
assume
that
the
court
held
that
it
could
seize,
it
couldn't
take
any
book
out
of
circulation.
there
is
an
adversary
hearing
and
a
judicial
determination
of
obscenity.
you
suggest
that
perhaps
you
might
not
have
the
evidence
in
such
cases
because
purveyors
would
have
notice,
would
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
way
into
the
evidence,
but
in
case
of
books
of
these
that
there
is
no
problem
you
can
buy
the
books,
you
can
have
them
and
there
is
no
question
about
that,
isn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
could
you
live
with
it,
wouldn't
there
be
some
kind
of
obscenity
that
you
can't
buy
and
take
home
with
you
that
you
might
never
be
able
to
prove
in
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
buy
the
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
buy,
you
could
have
the
evidence,
to
think
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
things
that,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
see,
but
not
buy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
you
are
not
going
to
avoid
the
problem
of
acquisition
of
some
of
them
anyway
because
even
under
your
rule
you
are
going
to
have
to
as
a
rule
of
you
would
like
if
you
are
going
to
have
to
present
the
evidence
to
the
judge,
you
know,
some
kind
of
a
evidence
to
the
judge
to
get
a
warrant,
but
you
can't
just
go
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
you
are
going
to
have
to
have
something
to
show
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
prior,
prior
restraint
an
attempt
to
prior
to
a
judicial
determination
after
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
the
question,
prior
to
publication.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think,
were
on
sale,
they
were
being
circulated?
justice
byron
r.
