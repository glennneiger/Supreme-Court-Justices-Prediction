mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment,
ordering
the
destruction
by
burning
or
otherwise
of
1715
books
on
the
ground
that
they're
allegedly
obscene.
the
action
was
instituted
by
mr.
ferguson,
the
attorney
general,
on
july
25th
1961
after
he
had
read
seven
nightstand
books.
having
read
these
seven
books,
he
decided
read
59
other
nightstand
books
or
59
and
all
nightstand
books
were
obscene.
he
filed
an
information,
on
belief
only,
asking
for
a
search
warrant
for
the
seizure
and
the
burning
of
the
59
nightstand
books.
the
information
was
duly
filed
in
geary
county.
the
seven
books
that
mr.
ferguson
had
read
were
given
to
judge
fletcher
to
read.
these
were
appropriately
underlined
and
noted
for
their
sexual
passages.
the
books
were
taken
to
judge
fletcher's
home
at
5
o'clock.
judge
fletcher
held
an
ex
parte
hearing
at
8
o'clock
or
8:30
at
the
court
house.
at
this
hearing,
he
previewed
one
or
more
books
as
the
record
states,
decided
that
the
seven
books
were
probably
obscene
and
that
therefore,
the
other
59
books
or
the
other
52
books
were
also
probably
obscene.
he,
therefore,
ordered
the
sheriff
to
seize
all
copies
of
these
59
books
that
he
could
find
that
the
p-k
news
company
and
the
sheriff
appropriately
went
out
with
the
warrant,
seized
31
different
titles,
constituting
the
1715
books,
left
the
warrant
with
the
notice
of
hearing
at
the
p-k
news
company.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
sir,
he
had
seven
books
and
only
six
of
them
were
in
the
59.
there
was
one
book
that
mr.
ferguson
had
read,
but
he
didn't
name,
so
he
had
only
before
him
6
of
the
59,
and
though
it's
conceded,
he
did
not
read
in
their
entirety
at
the
hearing.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
the
information
mr.
ferguson
named
59
books
as
the
dependence,
but
mr.
ferguson
himself
hadn't
read
the
59.
mr.
ferguson
read
seven
books.
based
upon
the
reading
of
these
seven
books,
somebody
must
have
given
him
the
list
that
nightstand
also
put
out
52
other
books.
concededly
mr.
ferguson
did
not
read
these
other
52
books,
he
read
seven
books
only.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
seven,
seven
books.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
previewed
as
to
seven,
he
did
not
read
them.
he
says
in
the
record
he
did
not
read
them.
he
looked
at
portions
of
them
and
he
looked
at
portions
that
had
been
identified,
they
were
marked.
so
that
he
used
hicklin
test
clearly
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
read
the
books
in
their
entity,
he
went
directly
to
the
sexual
passages
of
the
books.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
shall
hope
so
judge,
i
think
that's,
as
a
minimum
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
under
a
statute
such
as
we
have
here
mr.
justice
brennan,
where
books
are
seized,
and
particularly
where
we
have
1,715
books.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
even
on
the
seven,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
this
that
you
would
have
to
read
the
books
in
their
entity
before
you
suppress
a
book
for
a
moment,
because
what's
being
done
is
the
seizure
of
books
and
all
copies,
they
were
different,
just
that
seven,
we're
still
talking
about
all
copies
of
these
seven
books.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
and
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
prior
restraint
of
communication
to
take
all
copies
of
a
particular
book
without
a
judge
reading
the
book
in
the
entirety
and
giving
it
a
constitutional
judgment,
and
that
cannot
be
done
when
you
go
to
underlined
portions
only.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
do
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
whole
argument
there
in
terms
of
having
to
give
careful
constitutional
judgment
to
the
work.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
judge
hadn't
seen
anything
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
too
much
difference,
if
a
judge
hasn't
seen
anything,
or
if
he
only
sees
those
portions
of
a
book
that
the
attorney
general
calls
to
his
attention
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
think
that
would
be
insufficient
in
my
own
judgment.
i
think
that
even
a
reading
of
the
book
by
the
judge
himself
without
any
adversary
proceeding
–-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
trial.
i
do
believe
that
it
would
be
a
denial
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
you
could
do
it
without
some
hearing
by
the
party
you
want
to
defend
the
book,
and
it
comes
wholly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
how
much?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
my
own
judgment
would
be
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
full
adversary
proceeding
before
you
could
have
any
kind
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
would
be
two
things.
perhaps
it
would
be
less
mr.
justice
brennan
if
they
were
going
after
one
book
alone,
but
whereas
here,
they're
going
after
all
copies
of
a
particular
book,
where
you
have
prior
restraint
in
totality.
you
cannot
have
that
in
my
opinion
without
of
adversary
proceeding.
that
would
be
different
than
an
attempt
to
seize
one
copy
of
a
particular
book
perhaps
for
a
criminal
proceeding.
that
would
raise
a
different
question,
but
here
you
have
suppression,
total
suppression
when
you
say
take
all
copies
of
this
particular
book
before
you
can
do
that,
it
is
my
view
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
full
adversary
proceeding,
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
i
think
the
person
demands
nothing
less.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
that
--
in
the
kingsley
case
your
honor,
there
was
an
agreement
by
the
parties
that
they
would
be
an
ex
parte
injunction
prior
to
determination.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
there
was
some
ambiguity
in
this
statue.
i
believe
that
it's
been
interpreted
by
new
york
is
not
permitting
that.
i
believe
that
new
york
requires
some
kind
of
an
adversary
proceeding
before
--
i
am
not
--
i
don't
want
to
say
dispositive
because
it
wasn't
in
the
kingsley
case,
it
wasn't
clear
that,
but
in
a
subsequent
case
in
the
larkin
case
that
matter
was
raised
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
appellate
court
there,
not
the
court
of
the
appeals,
but
the
intermediate
court
ruled
that
there
could
not
be
a
restraint
prior
to
the
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
larkin.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
am
sorry
your
honor
i
do
not,
but
i
will
try
to
finish
it
by
letter
to
the
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
permit
the
taking
of
a
book
out
of
circulation
on
a
ex
parte
determination
by
anyone.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
like
to
think
that
the
bail
works
effectively
enough
and
fairly
enough
so
that
the
person
is
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
if
this
was
for
perhaps
a
few
hours
that
would
be
a
different
case
perhaps,
but
here
we
take
it
for
at
least
10
days,
because
under
the
kansas
statue
once
these
books
are
seized
under
the
warrant,
there
may
not
be
a
hearing
in
less
than
10
days.
the
statute
so
provides
that
the
first
time
a
hearing
could
be
had
would
be
after
10
days,
so
we
know
that
under
the
kansas
statute
the
books
and
all
copies
of
the
books
are
taken
first
and
held
or
at
least
10
days
before
there
is
any
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
right
your
honor,
not
less
than
5
no
more
than
20.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
and
not
less
then
10
and
there
is
no
outside
limited,
so
the
version
is
just
on
10
days.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
search
warrant
provides
for
a
hearing
on
the
7th
day
of
august
which
is
about
12
days
after
the
seizure.
on
the
7th
day
of
august,
we
filed
a
motion
to
quash.
we
attacked
the
statute
on
its
face,
and
as
construed
and
applied,
and
a
hearing
was
held,
pursuant
to
the,
just
on
the
search
warrant
on
the
validity
of
a
search
warrant
and
on
the
validity
of
the
statute.
this
was
promptly
heard
and
decided
by
judge
fletcher.
thereupon,
we
made
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
the
matter
was
set
down
for
an
earlier
hearing
and
mr.
shermaghan
asked
for
additional
time
within
which
to
prepare
because
there
were
there
were
31
different
titles
which
he
had
not
read.
so
that
he
was
caught
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
he
wanted
speed
on
the
one
hand,
and
he
wanted
to
prepare
on
the
other.
the
matter
came
on
for
hearing,
september
14th
on
the
merits,
prior
to
that
time
–-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
on
the
issue
of
obscenity,
that's
i
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
was
a
trial
if
you
want
to
call
it
a
trial.
actually
there
was
not
much
more
of
a
trial
around
the
september
14th
than
there
would
be
by
the
mere
reading,
because
the
prosecution
took
the
31
books,
put
them
into
evidence
and
then
rested
and
in
that
way
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well
the
defendant
demurred.
the
defendant
said
that
the
prosecution
had
not
made
out
a
case
that
as
a
minimum,
that
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
started
off
with
the
premise
that
books
are
constitutionally
protected
and
if
they
were
to
be
found
obscene
under
the
rob
albert's
test
annunciated
by
this
court
that
a
minimum
requirement
placed
upon
the
prosecution
was
to
prove
by
evidence
that
the
books
did
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor,
that
is
to
say,
taking
the
31
books
we
had
here.
they
could
have
shown
if
they
had
a
mind
to,
that
the
language
used
in
these
31
books
went
far
beyond
the
language
to
be
found
in
tropic
of
cancer,
beyond
what
was
to
be
found
in
tropic
of
capricorn
and
lady
chatterley's
lover,
but
the
sexual
detections
and
the
condor
with
which
these
matters
were
done,
had
never
before
been
put
down
on
paper.
if
they
had
done
that,
then
at
least,
they
might
have
made
out
some
kind
of
prime
faice
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
i
didn't
tell
them
any
–-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
surely
would.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we're
talking
now
about
only
31,
all
of
those
that
were
not--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
all
right.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
and
i
would
also
be
here
as
with
regard
to
the
other
seven
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
i
won
on
the
merits
your
honor
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
books
would
have
been
returned.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
the
books
would
have
been
returned
if
we
had
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no
sir.
and
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
we
had
such
a
trial
theoretically.
we
had
two
proceedings
before
the
judge
fletcher
your
honor.
the
first
one
was
whether
the
search
warrant
was
any
good
and
whether
the
statute
was
valid
on
its
face.
judge
fletcher
held
that
the
statute
was
valid
on
its
face
and
as
applied
and
that
the
search
warrant
was
good.
then
thereafter
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
obscenity
or
non-obscenity
of
the
books
themselves,
the
31
books
and
it
was
at
this
hearing
as
i
say
that
the
state
put
in
the
books
and
rested.
thereafter
we
demurred
as
i
pointed
out
saying
that
they
hadn't
proved
the
essential
ingredient
to
be
offence
that
if,
if
a
book
can
be
suppressed
only
if
it
goes
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
in
description
or
representation,
if
matter
is
pertaining
to
sex,
then
the
prosecution
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
books
did
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
your
honor
and
i
think
this
is
important
because
the
matter
has
come
up
before.
as
i
understood
there
was
one
important
addition
made
to
the
law
of
obscenity
made
by
the
roth
alberts'
case.
up
until
roth
alberts,
it
was
thought
that
obscenity
was
inutility
determined
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
consider
outside
of
the
fours
corners
of
the
book.
you
read
the
book,
you
like
it
or
you
don't
like
it.
if
you
don't
like
it,
it's
obscene,
if
you
like
it,
it's
protected.
that's
what
hicklin
was
and
that's
what
the
law
was
prior
to
roth
alberts.
the
one
thing
that
was
added
in
roth
alberts
that
was
useful
in
defending
books
was
this
notion
that
the
books
had
additionally,
the
charged
books
had
to
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor.
that
meant
for
the
first
time
as
you
defend
these
cases
that
you
can
go
into
court
and
bring
before
a
jury
that
doesn't
read,
because
i've
tried
many
of
these
cases
and
for
the
most
part,
you
will
find
10
of
the
12
jurists
saying
that
they
have
not
read
a
novel
in
the
last
five
years
or
so.
so
that
and
for
the
first
time
you
were
able
to
bring
before
a
jury,
works
which
are
freely
circulating
in
society
and
show
them
that
language
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
outside
the
record
i
had
requested
the
books
like
that
judge,
but
that's
only
after
there's
been
a
conviction
and
a
hearty
condemnation,
and
i
think
this
double
standard
is
kind
of
an
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
should
hope
not
judge.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes,
yes
your
honor.
these
books
are
here
[laughter]
and
we
have
an
extra
set
in
addition.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
i
can
say
this
that
i
trust
that
if
censorship
is
to
continue
and
i
hope
it
will
not
that,
and
that
you
will
read
them
because
somebody
has
to
do
some
protecting,
but
it
goes
down
below,
leaves
us
with
a
mighty
little
(inaudible)
mr.
stanley
fleishman
there
is
no
question
about
it.
it
puts
at
large
the
whole
issue
to
either
to
a
judge
or
a
jury
depending
on
who
the
try
over
fact
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
book
deeply
offends,
and
that's
all
it
comes
to.
you
can
see
it
here
in
this
kansas
statute
what
is
it
that
mr.
ferguson
comes
to
wasn't
said.
he
says,
the
work
is
obscene,
if
it
deals
with
sex
in
a
manner
which
is
generally
offensive
to
decency.
well,
if
that's
not
censorship,
i
don't
know
what
censorship
is?
how
can
anybody
know
in
advance
whether
or
not
a
book
is
good
or
bad
under
such
a
stand?
you
know
under
the
kansas
statute
as
interpreted
by
judge
fletcher,
which
is
equally
bad.
he
said
whether
the
book
aroused
sexual
thoughts?
well,
any
book
worth
itself
that
a
novel
is
going
to
arouse
some
sexual
thoughts
in
some
persons
under
some
circumstances,
so
that
the
rule
is
so
big
that
you
find
the
whole
rule
of
obscenity
in
the
exceptions
and
we
don't
know
what
the
exceptions
are.
there
is
no
question
but
that
roth
alberts
as
is
being
ripped
under
right
now
is
a
failure,
if
it
was
meant
to
protect
literature
generally
and
to
protect
the
freedom
of
speech
or
press.
it
is
not
doing
that,
that's
i
have
tried
enough
cases
to
assure
your
honors
of
that
and
i'd
like
to
address
one
moment
to
mr.
justice
black
in
terms
of
the
criminal
prosecutions.
within
the
last
four
months,
i
had
a
case
where
a
man
was
sent
to
jail
for
25
years
for
the
distribution
of
one
book,
so
that
the
terror
that
is
going
on
under
this
standard
is
a
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
it
was
a
book
called
the
‘sex
life
of
a
cop'
and
i
guess
if
had
been
called
the
sex
life
of
shoe
salesman,
there
would
have
been
no
prosecution
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
the
one
where
a
distributor
got
25
years
for
the
distribution
of
one
book.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
no,
sir.
no,
that's
another
case
and
i
was
addressing
myself
only
to
what
mr.
justice
black
had
asked
whether
there
kind
of
penitentiary
terms
being
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
trust
not.
i've
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
i
have
every
confidence
that
we
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that's
pending
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
was
a
jury
trial
and
a
forum
selected
by
the
government.
it
was
a
california
firm
that
was
brought
to
grand
rapids,
michigan
because
the
government
had
thought
that
they
would
find
a
happy
jury
there,
but
that's
not
our
case.
coming
back
to
the
proceedings
that
we
had
on
the
merits
so
called,
whether
these
31
books
were
or
were
not
obscene,
after
we
demurred
to
the
evidence
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case
the
defendants
did
two
things.
first
of
all
we
introduced
31
other
books.
we
said,
you
have
31
books,
we
will
put
on
31,
29
of
these
other
books
were
in
the
library
in
junction
city.
two,
the
librarian
said,
she
would
have
liked
to
buy
them,
but
they
were
too
expensive.
in
addition,
we
called
three
persons
who
have
qualified
as
experts,
experts
in
the
sense
that
they
read
a
great
deal.
they
said
that
they
were
familiar
with
the
literature
that
generally
circulates
in
america
and
in
junction
city
particularly
and
that
they
were
able
to
state
affirmatively
that
talking
about
language
first,
the
so
called
four
letter
words
while
they
were
entirely
absent
in
the
31
books
before
your
honors
now,
they
were
very
prevalent
in
books
that
were
to
be
found
in
hardcover
nationally
circulated
such
as
‘lady
chatterley's
lover,'
such
as
tropic
of
cancer.
themes
such
as
the
sexual
relationships
between
an
adult
man
44,
and
a
14
year
old
girl
would
be
found
in
books
like
‘lolita'.
from
all
of
this,
the
three
experts,
comparing
these
31
books
and
the
31
books
that
had
been
introduced
as
being
in
the
library
and
generally
circulating,
the
experts
said
that
the
31
books
here
did
not
go
beyond
customary
limits
of
candor
and
the
language
used,
they
were
calmer,
they
were
muted.
in
the
kinds
of
sexual
scenes
that
were
depicted,
these
were
muted,
compared
to
lady
chatterley's
lover
and
the
other
books
that
were
introduced,
that
in
the
variety
of
situations,
these
books
did
not
go
beyond.
in
total,
the
three
experts
said
that
assuming
the
test
of
obscenity
is,
do
these
books
go
beyond
other
books
which
are
generally
circulating,
the
answer
is
no.
thereafter,
judge
fletcher
wrote
his
opinion
and
he
said,
well,
the
big
difference
between
these
31
paperback
books
and
the
31
books
that
were
introduced
by
the
defendants
is
this,
that
in
the
paperback
books,
in
the
books
before
the
court,
the
dominant
thing
of
the
books
was
sex
with
plot
scenes
of
servings,
whereas
in
lady
chatterley's
lover
and
the
other
books,
the
dominant
theme
was
not
sex,
they
had
a
plot
independently
and
sex
was
merely
subservient.
in
that
way,
he
said
there
was
a
distinction
and
then
he
applied
this
test.
he
said,
if
he
found
that
the
books
had
the
purpose
and
effect
and
defect
of
inciting
sexual
desires,
on
the
average
person
in
this
community
--
this
community
was
what
he
used,
then
the
book
was
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
it
could
be
suppressed.
kansas
supreme
court
affirmed.
kansas
supreme
court
used
a
variety
of
tests
in
determining
that
these
books
were
obscene?
first
of
all,
they
went
to
the
statute,
and
the
statute
is
different
from
the
test
that
was
used
by
judge
fletcher.
then,
the
supreme
court
approved
of
judge
fletcher's
test.
then
the
court
said,
by
looking
at
the
excerpts,
because
they
apparently
hadn't
read
the
31
books,
looking
at
the
excerpts
of
the
books
that
were
in
the
back
of
mr.
ferguson's
brief,
they
checked
it
out.
the
page
references
were
correct
and
based
upon
that
these
books
surely
came
within
the
roth
alberts'
test
also
and
finally
to
make
it
good
measure,
they
said
any
offenders,
hardcore
pornography
is
bad
by
any
test
we
know,
including
the
test
that
was
promulgated
by
the
wit,
irvin
s.
cobb
who
said,
that
his
test
of
obscenity
was
this
"if
the
depth
of
the
dirt
exceeded
the
breadth
of
the
wit,
then
a
work
was
obscene.”
now
i
dare
say
that
judge
cobb
has
not
to
been
elevated
to
the
bench
yet
and
his
definition
is
probably
one
that
would
be
one
to
protect
the
freedom
of
speech
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
well,
actually
of
the
31,
judge
fletcher
had
read
six
of
them.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
he
read
six.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
31
is
what
was
seized.
the
warrant
called
for
the
seizure
of
59,
but
they
went
to
the
news
company
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
they
only
found
the
31.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
make
the
warrant
point
on
all
31.
i
don't
think
even
for
the
seven
the
warranty
is
right
either.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
mr.
justice
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
was
wrong
on
the
name
it's
tenney.
tenney
against
liberty
news
13
a.d.2d
770
and
perhaps
i
can
read
for
a
moment
the
applicable
portion.
the
appellants
point
out
and
protest
the
fact
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
contained
in
the
show
cause
order
issued
originally.
while
it
may
be
as
the
respondent
contends
that
the
propriety
of
validity
of
that
stay
had
become
moot
having
being
superseded
by
the
temporary
injunction,
we
are
of
the
view
that
section
22a
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
does
not
authorize
the
issuance
of
an
ex
parte
injunction.
that
section
provides
for
expeditious
determination
of
the
issues
and
even
a
temporary
injunction
under
section
22a
should
issue
only
after
both
sides
have
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
i'd
like
address
myself
to
two
things.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
surly
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would
agree
that
they
(inaudible)
great
literature,
but
they
are
not
--
no
worse
your
honor
that
most
of
the
novels
in
the
field
of
detective
stories
and
westerns
and
the
like,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
literature
around
which
is
not
great
literature
and
we've
only
one
shakespeare
since
he
died
--
before
he
died.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
i
would.
i
would
say
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
in
several
sentences
and
first
of
all
i
don't
want
say
it
has
high
social
value,
but
i
think
that
any
book
that
communicates
ideas
has
some
value
in
it
to
begin
with.
they
have
entertainment
value,
for
those
people
who
cannot
read
tropic
of
cancer
or
cannot
read
lady
chatterley's
lover
because
they
have
a
limited
educational
background,
its
serves
for
them
something
like
the
same
function
that
literature
serves
for
the
more
educated,
and
there
is
class
basis
that's
going
on
here
your
honor
that
i
think
is
invidious
and
ought
to
be
dealt
with
seriously,
and
that
is
apparently
if
you
are
educated
you
could
have
a
certain
amount
of
sexual
titillation,
but
you
may
not
if
you
are
a
truck
driver.
that
seems
to
be
the
thrust
that
is
going
on
here
that
there
was
no
shakespeare
is
true,
but
there
--
as
i
say
if
you
look
at
the
news
stands
generally,
you
will
find
that
there
is
not
much
of
great
value,
of
all
of
the
books
that
are
published
in
the
course
of
the
year
i
doubt
that
1%
will
survive
for
a
five
year
period,
and
that
cannot
be
the
test
for
first
amendment
protection.
moreover
physiologists
tell
us
that
there
is
(inaudible)
value,
that
people
do
live
under
a
great
deal
of
pressure
and
one
of
the
pressure
are
is
the
sexual
repression
that
they
are
living
under
and
there
is
an
importance
in
being
able
to
read
about
matters
that
people
are
thinking
about
anyhow,
and
i
do
believe
that
this
court
make
a
serious
error
in
the
constant
use
of
the
word
filth
and
dirt
for
books
which
do
nothing
more
then
arouse
sexual
desires,
because
that's
all
the
claim
is
here.
kansas
doesn't
anything
else
except
that
these
books
arouse
sexual
desires.
now
if
the
arousing
of
sexual
desires
is
such
an
evil,
i
think
we're
in
a
pretty
bad
way.
i
think
that
we
make
a
mistake
in
categorizing
books,
if
we
take
the
attorney
general's
statement.
he
says
it's
a
business
of
$2
billion.
that
means
that
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
this
country
is
spending
$20,
$20
a
year.
if
you
take
a
family
of
five
that's
a
$100
a
year,
now
it
can't
be.
it
can't
be
that
there
is
that
many
people
who
are
so
corrupt
and
if
we're
taking
as
a
standard
that
if
a
work
does
not
go
beyond
what
society
tolerates,
i
think
that
with
learning
that
society
tolerates
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
sex
and
rightly
so.
and
i
think
that
the
notion
that
the
problem
is
easily
solved
by
the
prosecution
mr.
chief
justice
is
and
with
serious
criminal
penalties
like
25
years
and
the
like,
is
to
invade
the
first
amendment
rights
even
more
seriously
if
i
may
say
so
in
this
proceeding
because
people
will
be
so
afraid
to
distribute
books
that
deal
with
sex,
that
they
will
stay
away
from
the
whole
field.
i
know
if
i'm
advising
a
book
publisher
and
i
know
that
he
is
going
to
go
jail
for
25
years
or
some
such
number
of
years,
i
would
tell
him
to
publish
a
cook
book
and
that's
all.
and
i'll
say
this,
and
it's
a
deterrent
because
mr.
henry
miller
who
is
the
author
as
your
honors
know
of
a
tropic
of
cancer
has
been
indicted
in
new
york
and
there
are
attempts
being
made
now
to
extradite
him
from
california
to
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
standing
trial.
there
is
enormous
amount
of
terror
that
is
going
on
with
these
prosecutions.
kansas
happens
to
be
more
concerned
as
i
would
see
with
civil
rights
now
through
these
proceedings
as
evil
as
they
are,
than
some
of
the
other
states
that
go
on
with
the
criminal
prosecutions,
that
are
wrongly
brought.
by
that
i
mean
that
there
are
states
which
will
go
after
book
after
book
criminally,
throwing
people
in
jail
and
denying
them
bail
and
this
happens
regularly
on
books
that
we
know
are
constitutionally
protected
and
finally
we
do
get
a
vindication
in
the
appellate
courts
and
then
the
courts
are
criticized
as
your
honor
says,
but
wrongly
criticized
because
the
courts
are
only
doing
their
constitutional
duty
in
giving
some
protection,
but
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
look
there
is
this
difference
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
that
is
that
there
is
really
a
very
serious
constitutional
difficulty
in
the
sense
that
nobody
does
know
what
obscenity
is.
your
honors
have
sat
here
now
for
two
days
and
in
the
facts
that
your
honors
really
don't
know.
now,
if
your
honors
don't
know
what
obscenity
is,
then
the
burden
has
shifted
back
to
the
intermediate
appellate
courts,
you
hope
that
they
are
going
to
know,
but
how
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court
going
to
know
if
your
honors
don't
know?
so
they
shifted
back
to
the
trial
court.
they
say,
well
the
trail
court
is
going
to
know,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
when
there
was
a
determination
that
a
word
is
obscene,
whether
that
be
in
a
proceeding
such
as
we
have
here
now,
which
is
a
civil
proceeding
or
whether
it's
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
the
truth
is
that
it
is
always
an
ex
parte
determination,
not
ex
parte,
it
is
ex
post
facto,
you
have
what
mr.
justice
hand
said,
ad
hoc
legislation,
a
trier
of
fact
for
reasons
that
are
never
explained
besides
that
the
particular
book
or
the
particular
books
should
not
circulate,
and
because
there
are
so
many
subjective
factors
that
go
in
there,
there's
very
little
room
for
any
effective
appellate
review
because
the
appellate
court
say
as
your
honors
have
said,
how
do
we
know
one
way
or
the
other.
so
you
come
down
to
really
sending
people
to
jail
under
no
law
at
all,
expect
the
old
law
that
they
had
in
germany,
which
is,
if
it's
bad
for
the
society
at
large,
that's
all
it
is,
how
does
that
differ
from
what
mr.
ferguson
says
here
that
if
the
defense
generally
--
if
it
generally
offends
notions
of
decency.
now
we
couldn't
have
a
political
test
that
would
say
that
if
a
book
was
politically
offensive
to
the
majority
of
the
people,
that
it
is
to
be
suppressed.
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
problem
that
we
have
here
can
be
solved
and
should
be
solved
by
saying
that
speech
which
deals
with
sex
should
be
treated
exactly
the
same
as
we
treat
speech
that
deals
with
other
troublesome
areas,
politics,
religion,
economics,
and
have
the
same
test
applicable
if
there
is
some
link
between
conduct
and
the
books
then
and
only
then
can
there
be
suppression,
but
to
say
that
you
can
suppress
a
work
because
it
arouses
a
sexual
thought,
kansas
doesn't
even
say
it's
a
bad
sexual
thought,
just
that
it
arouses
sexual
thoughts,
that
i
submit
your
honor
is
a
deep
intrusion
into
first
amendment
and
cannot
stand.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
i
believe
there
is
mr.
chief
justice
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
when
we
say
negligence,
people
have
had
some
considerable
experience
in
terms
of
knowing
that
if
you
for
example
drive
down
a
highway
that's
crowded
70
miles
an
hour,
that
an
accident
is
likely
to
occur.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
not
--
they've
had
experience
your
honor
but
there
isn't
any
experience
with
regard
to
what
effect
the
reading
of
a
book
is
going
to
have
on
the
average
person.
many
people
reading
these
31
books
that
mr.
ferguson
had
would
be
boring
to
tears.
now
we
are
going
to
send
a
man
to
jail
for
writing
a
book
or
publishing
a
book
that
bores
people.
i
mean
we
don't
know.
we
simply
do
not
know
what
effect
it
will
have
on
people
and
the
only
thing
we
know
is
that
it
may
arouse
some
sexual
desires
in
some
people
under
some
circumstances,
that's
knowing
very
little.
it
really
is,
we
don't
have
a
body
of
knowledge
with
regard
to
the
impact
of
works.
there
is
room
for
a
lot
of
thinking
about
it,
but
i
honestly
believe
that
you
can
read
this
book
and
(inaudible)
to
all
over
the
--
take
tropic
of
cancer,
a
good
example.
there
mr.
ferguson
from
kansas
says
he
knows
the
book
is
not
obscene,
the
enlightened
state
of
new
york
says
it
is
obscene,
they
say
it's
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
ferguson
says
it's
protected
by
freedom
of
speech,
how
is
this
a
sensible
text?
mr.
stanley
fleishman
but
there
is
a
difference
your
honor,
because
first
of
all
it
has
an
impact
only
for
a
particular
case.
i
mean
either
win
or
lose
my
case
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
we're
in
the
area
of
freedom
of
speech
now.
if
a
mistake
is
made
all
society
suffers.
if
tropic
of
cancer
is
found
by
a
jury
in
new
york
to
be
obscene
that
means
nobody
in
new
york
can
read
that
book.
now
a
mistake
there
is
enormously
more
serious
than
a
mistake
which
denies
me
a
rightful
claim.
i
think
i'd
be
unhappy
if
i
didn't
get
the
money
i
was
entitled
to,
but
the
significance
is
different
but
--
more
than
that
we
don't
have
the
body
of
knowledge,
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
a
lot
about
accidents
and
how
they
happen
from
our
ordinary
experience,
we
do
not
know
the
effect
of
books
on
people
and
i
take
it
that
no
one
would
say
here
that
it's
a
social
evil
to
arouse
sexual
desires,
that's
all
kansas
says,
can
that
be
sufficient
to
throw
people
in
jail?
and
it's
only
by
saying
strongly
that
it's
filth,
it's
dirt
that
we
start
saying
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
it.
why
shouldn't
there
be
books
that
arouse
sexual
desires,
very
much
like
there
are
books
that
arouse
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
procedurally
i
would
say
these
books
are
not
obscene
and
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
fleishman
assuming
they
are
and
if
there
was
adequate
procedure
and
i
--
in
this
i
include
a
jury
trial
and
i
include
–-
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
if
i
had,
it
would
be
a
very
small
one,
yes.
mr.
stanley
fleishman
thank
you.
