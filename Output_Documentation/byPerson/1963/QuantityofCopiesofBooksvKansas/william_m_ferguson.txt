mr.
william
m.
ferguson
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
was
designed
to
comply
with
the
mandates
of
this
court
and
it
was
filed
in
1961,
with
roth
and
in
particular
with
respect
to
marcus.
we
prepared
the
litigation
in
my
office
with
the
anticipation
in
that
it
might
well
be
before
this
court
as
is
the
case
of
so
many
of
these
obscenity
cases.
the
statute
in
kansas,
the
language
is
taken
exactly
from
the
approved
charge
in
the
roth
case,
charge
to
the
jury.
the
forum
was
a
capable,
young
judge.
it
had
been
suggested
here
yesterday
that
this
was
sort
of
a
kangaroo
proceeding
in
kansas,
this
was
not
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
overruling
the
demurrer
to
the
evidence
the
judge,
judge
fletcher
said
that
his
personal
views
coincided
exactly
with
those
of
mr.
justice
black
as
suggested
in
the
smith
case.
the
judge
was
handed
a
copy
of
marcus
at
the
time
he
was
presented
with
the
information
and
if
the
court
will
consider
the
transcripts
in
this
proceeding,
the
court
will
find
that
all
the
constitutional
questions
that
are
here
before
this
court
were
litigated
at
the
trial
level
and
then
re-litigated
at
the
state
level
and
that
the
trial
court
meticulously
answered
the
objections
raised
by
counsel
throughout
the
trial.
the
purpose
of
filing
this
action
was
to
reach
the
evil
that
50
states
have
considered
to
be
an
evil
in
the
federal
government,
namely
that
matter
of
obscenity
and
this
case
involves
that
the
business
of
purveying
of
obscenity.
it's
now
a
part
of
a
$2
billion
business.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
--
it's
my
feeling
that
this
is
really
as
much
a
ferguson
versus
skrupa
proposition
as
it
is
a
first
amendment
proposition.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it
is
recently
reported
in
the
kansas
city
star,
your
honor,
a
$2
billion
business.
it
was
--
in
1955,
it
was
a
half-a-billion
dollar
business,
by
1964
it
has
become
a
$2
billion
business.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
suspect
your
honor
that
is
a
newspaper
estimate.
no
way
to
tell
of
course
that
half-a-billion
dollar
estimate
came
from
the
congressional
committee
that
investigated
juvenile
delinquency
in
1955.
what
the
state
here
is
trying
to
do
is
to
make
roth
workable
and
what
we
hope
to
accomplish
by
having
this
court
affirm
the
procedure
in
that
case,
in
this
case
at
bar,
so
that
the
prosecutors
will
have
some
definite
or
delicate
tools
with
which
to
work
in
this
area.
it's
a
concern
to
me
as
attorney
general
and
i
am
sure
it
is
my
colleagues
who
are
prosecutors
that
the
business
of
smut
peddling
has
reached
such
propositions.
the
question
that's
considered
yesterday
with
respect
to
the
procedure,
considered
the
question
as
to
probable
cause
as
to
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
trial
judge
could
have
found
from
his
consideration
of
these
six
books
that
these
additional
books
were
obscene.
it's
been
suggested
that
the
attorney
general
had
them
properly
marked.
we
submit
to
the
court,
this
isn't
necessary.
any
book,
any
of
these
books
can
be
opened
to
any
page
and
a
sexual
description
will
be
following
within
a
few
paragraphs.
it
doesn't
take
a
directory
to
find
the
sexual
passages
in
these
little
books.
now
these
books
were
presented,
the
six,
to
the
trial
judge
and
here
is
one
of
them,
‘the
wife
swappers,'
on
the
first
page
it
says,
‘the
wife
swappers.”
in
bold
print
it
says,
“members
of
this
lust
club
had
a
different
woman
every
night.”
you
turn
to
the
fly
leaf
and
it
says,
‘lust
sated
couples'
and
in
big
letters,
‘these
eight
couples
are
members
of
a
wife-swapping,
mate-switching
sex
club,
so
vile
it
will
stun
you.'
on
the
next
page
it
says,
the
wife
swappers,
‘this
is
an
original
night
stand
book.”
on
the
next
page,
‘printed
and
bound
in
united
states
of
america.'
on
the
back,
‘problems
in
bed
game
of
wife
swappers'
and
on
the
inside
cover,
‘our
list
of
other
night
stand
books.
‘sex
circus,'
the
same,
this
was
handed
to
the
judge,
‘sinful
world
of
the
big
top'
on
the
fly
leaf,
‘four
passionate
women,
desperate
passions,
sin
is
the
star
act.'
on
the
back,
‘passion
freaks
on
a
sin
midway'
and
then
also
a
list
of
other
nightstand
books.
now
each
of
these
books
are
almost
exactly
same
length,
16,
190
pages,
11,
191,
two,
192,
one,
189.
by
considering
each
of
these
six,
it's
our
contention
that
they
were
so
much
alike
as
piece
and
a
part,
it's
interchangeable,
as
the
parts
on
them
both
way
and
the
judge
in
considering
these
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
they
are
identical.
this
was,
our
problem
here
is
whether
or
not
the
judge
could
find
probable
cause
for
ordering
the
seizure
of
59
when
he
had
only
seen
six.
they
are
formats
are
same.
their
authors
are
substantially
the
same,
the
sex
passages
occur
about
every
ten
pages.
so
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
they
are
the
same
--
the
titles
are
different,
the
plot
is
somewhat
different.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
they
are
not
precisely
the
same.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
say
that
their
format
is
the
same.
they
are
basically
the
same,
they
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
same
subject
matter,
that
the
judge
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
substantially
that's
correct
your
honor
and
that
the
judge
was
compelled
in
considering
these
six
to
determine
that
the
others
listed
if
these
were
obscene,
that
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
others
were
obscene.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
within
the,
in
the
back
of
the
ones
that
he
--
that
were
presented
to
him.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
this
is
a
form
of
prior
restraint,
we
don't
deny
that.
but
it's
our
concern,
it's
our
conception
of
this
thing,
your
honor
that
by
seeing
six,
he,
these
six,
of
course
each
case
has
to
stand
on
its
facts,
obviously
he
couldn't
pick
six
books
at
random
and
say
that
another
31
books
were
the
same,
but
these
are
so
identical
in
their
format.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
we
had
a
judicial
determination
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it
was
ex-parte.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that
is
one
of
the
questions
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
would
say
that's
true.
of
course
27
states
have
a
seizure
provision
similar
to
ours
and
this
court
has
never
up
to
this
point
said
that
there
must
be
a
full
adversary
proceeding
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
the
matter
of
practice
having
to
have
a
full
adversary
proceeding
in
a
business
like
this,
it
would
be
most
difficult.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
and
some
of
the
cases
have
so
indicated,
others
have
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
27
states.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
have
a
seizure
provision
of
one
time.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
1961.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
can't
determine
that,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
your
honor
some
of
them
are
recent
statutes,
but
i
can't
tell
you
which
ones
that
are,
but
27
of
them.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
this
is
--
i
assume
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
come
to
you
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
--
which
squarely
presents
this
question
of
whether
or
not
books
maybe
seized
without
a
full
adversary
proceeding,
you
have
said
of
course
that
there
must
be
a
judicial
proceeding
and
this
we
attempted
to
follow.
we
attempted
to
follow
marcus
as
nearly
as
we
could.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
i
say
--
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
probable
to
cause,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
right.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
this
kind
of
a
business
where
so
many
titles
are
involved
and
they
are
so
much
alike
are
somewhat
akin
to
contraband,
gambling,
liquor
and
so
on.
if
--
the
point
is
that
if
the
purveyor
of
this
pornography,
the
seller
is
advised
in
advance
what
you're
going
to
be
looking
for
it
may
not
be
there,
that's
in
essence,
it's
a
matter
for
the
prosecution
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
this
is
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
book?
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
why
not?
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
in
designing
this
case
your
honor,
it
was
our
feeling
when
you
deal
with
this
business
of
purveying
of
obscenity,
it's
more
practicable
to
reach
the
books
themselves
than
to
try
to
convict
a
seller
who
maybe
innocent
as
of
the
nature
of
these
books,
it
just
seemed
that
as
a
matter
of
mechanics
that
the
states
ought
to
have
the
right
to
choose
their
remedy.
we
chose
the
in
rem
remedy.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
don't
know
that
i'd
agree
with
that.
actually
it
would
have
been
i
think
equally
as
easy
to
prosecute
the
seller
of
these
books.
frankly
i
felt
that
this
would
reach
a
greater
number
of
books.
we
could
have
had
a
proceeding
in
each
one
of
these
books,
but
there
is
something
what
your
honor
says,
it
could
be
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
it's
so
far
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
of
course
i
might
make
two
answers
to
that
question.
first
that
to
call
these
books
as
kind
of
a
travesty
on
the
concept
of
freedom
of
speech
and
of
books,
secondly
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
sir
they
look
like
books,
but
your
honor
if
you
will
peruse
them
all
--
you
had
announced
from
the
bench
yesterday
that
you
didn't
intend
to,
if
you'd
peruse
them
you
would
--
i
think
my
point
would
be
borne
out.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
of
course
we
had
specifically
named
in
the
complaint
the
titles
that
were
taken.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
one
of
these
books
can
be
read
from
cover-to-cover
in
about
40
minutes
and
they
can
be
quickly
perused
as
to
their
contents
in
much
less.
so
the
judge
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
these
six
and
this
is
what
we
discussed
before
whether
or
not
the
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
we
feel
that
they
are
so
substantially
identical
that
he
had
--
at
least
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
others
were
obscene
and
he
so
found.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
if
he
had
a
basket
of
peas
and
he
was
given
six
peas
and
he
cracked
six
of
them
and
found
that
each
one
of
them
had
within
the
peas
within
the
pods
peas,
couldn't
he
as
a
matter
of
probable
cause
say
the
rest
of
these
in
the
basket
are
peas,
this
is
what
he
did.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
certainly
not,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
court
adopted
roth
and
hicklin
was
struck
down,
that
kind
of
an
approach
was
eliminated.
he
can
--
the
judge
could
tell
as
this
court
can
tell
that
when
considered
as
a
whole
these
little
books
meet
the
test
in
roth
and
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
sole
question
is
whether
in
looking
at
these,
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
others
who
are
also
listed
in
the
back,
whose
names
are
also
equally
suggested
and
they
were
on
the
complaint
whether
or
not
he
could
find
that
these
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
were
obscene
if
these
were.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
he
didn't
read
trailer
trollop,
the
lecher,
miami
call
girl,
no
longer
a
virgin,
the
sex
spy,
lover,
the
lustful
ones,
the
sex
jungle,
the
sinful
ones,
flesh
is
my
undoing,
the
seeds
of
sin,
sex
model,
$20
lust,
sin
cruise,
sin
camp,
love
nest,
sin
girls,
convention
girl
and
some
others.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
we
didn't
find
any
shakespeare
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
this
is
a
--
or
if
anything
this
is
a
fact
question
and
this
is
our
whole
point
that
based
upon
these
books
he
had
probable
cause.
of
course
he
would
have
no
probable
cause
to
seize
books
by
the
same
author
or
the
same
publisher,
unless
that
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
part
of
the
same
format
as
this
is.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
mr.
justice
goldberg
if
i
might
make
this
point?
it
is
the
tendency
of
the
providers
of
obscenity
to
prick
for
soft
spots
in
the
procedure.
this
court
will
set
up
a
--
an
improved
procedure
and
then
a
objection
will
be
suggested
with
respect
to
it
in
order
to
fragmentize
whatever
kind
of
procedure
there
is,
raise
the
question,
jury
trials
here,
prior
restrain.
so
long
as
another
question
can
be
presented
and
considered,
it
makes
it
virtually
impossible
to
carry
out
the
concept
of
roth
which
says
that
obscenity
can
be
prevented
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
had
some
complaints
that
were
sent
to
me.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
where
did
we
get
these?
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
we
seized
them
in
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
received
two
of
them
in
the
mail
saying,
general
did
you
realize
that
this
kind
of
stuff
was
being
sold
in
the
state
of
kansas?
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
of
course
we
could
and
this
court
have
suggested,
some
of
the
members
at
any
rate
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
get
at
them
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
mr.
henry
miller's
book,
but
i
cannot
tell
you
the
publisher.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
first
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
firstly
i
don't
believe
either
cancer
or
capricorn
are
obscene.
they
don't
meet
the
test
as
i
do.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
if
--
it
have
to
be
grounded
upon
a
similar
factual
situation.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
don't
think
we
could
have
done
it
on
sex
circus
alone.
i
don't
suppose
we
could
have
done
it
on
sex
circus
and
wife
swappers
alone,
but
i
feel
we
can
do
it
on
sex
circus,
wife
swappers,
sinning
season,
sin
song,
lesbian
love,
and
backstage
sinner
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
if
we
felt
that
we
had
enough
there
that
would
indicate
that
this
is
the
only
kind
of
business
that
they
were
in.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
since
i
began
this
case
there
has
only
been
one
other
case
filed
in
kansas
by
one
of
the
county
attorney's.
we
have
been
waiting
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yeah.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
we
could
do
it
that
way.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
it
is
our
view
in
kansas
that
this
is
a
more
expeditious
method
of
doing
it
and
we
feel
that
the
states
have
a
right
to
select
their
remedy
and
we
shouldn't
be
proscribed
by
the
constitution
from
using
this
technique
of
stopping
this
business
of
smut
peddling.
i
would
like
to
get
to
one
more
point
before
my
time
is
up
and
that
has
to
do
with
community
standards
and
what
constitutes
the
community.
it's
our
position
and
was
our
position
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
community
standard
is
properly
setout
in
roth.
it
doesn't
need
to
be
expanded
and
that
that
the
community
standards
and
what
constitutes
community
are
so
inextricably
interwoven
that
you
can't
consider
one
as
opposed
to
another
and
it's
our
position
that
the
way
to
handle
this
problem
is
to
do
it
in
a
way
similar
to
the
way
we
handled
a
problem
in
standard
of
care,
instruct
the
trier
of
fact,
if
it's
a
jury
or
a
judge
if
he
is
the
trier
of
fact
to
measure
the
average
person
in
the
community,
measure
the
thing
to
be
considered
against
the
attitudes,
the
summary
of
the
attitudes
of
the
average
person
in
community.
this
is
the,
this
is
the
method
we
use.
we
don't
think
it
can
be
a
geographic
concept
whether
it's
the
local
community,
the
state,
or
the
nation
because
the
result
will
be
substantially
the
same.
if
we
suggested
that
really
the
test
is
to
whether
or
not
obscenity
deals
with
sex
it
must
deal
with
sex,
and
whether
or
not
it
offends
the
generally
accepted
standards
of
candor
of
the
community
or
we
suggest
the
standards
of
decency.
now
this
court
in
roth
has
suggested
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
of
what
the
actual
test
is.
what
we
have
been
getting
into
recently
is
something
like
medieval
scholasticism,
how
many
angels
can
stand
on
the
head
of
a
pin.
really
all
these
test
means
substantially
the
same
thing.
the
trier
of
the
fact
is
going
to
measure
the
suggested
obscenity
against
a
community
standard
and
this
isn't
too
difficult.
i
think
the
court
did
an
excellent
job
in
roth.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
states
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
roth
work
rather
than
each
time
something
comes
before
this
court
to
give
us
a
negative
standard.
if
this
court
affirms
this
case
on
the
facts
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
states
will
have
some
opportunity
to
get
at
the
evil
that's
been
proscribed
by
each
of
the
legislatures.
the
standard
in
our
view
is
the
same,
whether
it's
state
or
national,
it's
the
same
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
trier
of
fact
should
determine
the
standard.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
not
less
than
10
days.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
not
less
than
10,
in
this
case
the
total
time
attributable
to
the
state
was
16
days.
the
court
in
the
record
says
that
time
is
the
essence
of
this
case
and
it
was
handled
with
dispatch.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no
outside
limit.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
oh!
there
is
only
been
one
case.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
certainly,
of
course
our
court,
the
supreme
court
approved
the
lower
court's
function
in
this
case
and
our
position
in
respect
to
this
is
that
the
court
should
be
assumed
to
carry
out
their
functions
with
diligence
as
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
sixteen
days
were
attributable
to
the
state
from
the
time
of
the
seizure
to
the
time
of
decision.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
ten
days
from
the
time
of
the
seizure.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
sixteen
days.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
want
to
make
this
point
that
the
sixteen
days
were
not
based
on
the
calendar
because
the
interveners
asked
for
an
extension
of
time,
a
continuance
which
was
granted,
but
there
were
16
actual
days
attributed
to
the
state
from
the
time
of
the
seizure
until
the
times
that
the
judge
made
his
decision.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
we
could
live
with
that
sort
of
a
rule
whether
or
not
this
court
wants
to
say
that
the
constitution
requires
it,
this
is
where
i
would
disagree.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
quite
right,
dirty
pictures.
the
hardcore
under
counter
type
this
would
be
the
situation
of
course
and
i
am
not
so
sure
there
wouldn't
be
a
situation
in
this
type.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
but
for
this
court
to
say
as
your
honors
suggested
that
for
us
to
say
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
that
the
states
may
not
seize
the
evidence
prior
to
a
full
hearing
on
merit
would
very
seriously
shackle
the
prosecution
in
connection
with
the
ones
that
are
not
so
readily
available
as
you
suggested.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
the
pictures.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
well
i
have
to
buy
more
surreptitiously
perhaps
than
these.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
oh!
markus,
it
so
indicates
there
must
be
a
judicial
hearing
and
this
we
followed.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
this
was
the
point
made
by
the
chief
justice,
we
could
have.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
we
could
of
course
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
this
is
a
regular
portion
of
the
criminal
procedure.
it's
only
the
fact
that
we
have
in
the
first
amendment
problem,
but
we
don't
do
that
here.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
hope
this
could
be
done
and
number
of
states
use
this
type
of
device.
the
question
here
i
think
is,
whether
or
not
the
states
are
going
to
be
given
a
some
latitude
within
the
first
amendment
to
deal
with
the
evil
that
their
legislatures
have
conceded
and
as
i
pointed
out
to,
the
difficulty
is
that
that
the
court
has
said
that
obscenity
maybe
prescribed
and
yet
in
case
after
case
it
appears
to
us
that
there
is
there
is
no
actual
way
to
do
it,
because
of
the
procedural
infirmities
and
this
is
the
technique
used
by
the
purveyors
of
obscenity
is
to
keep
pricking
away
at
the
infirmities
that
exist
in
the
procedure
without
ever
getting
to
the
merits
of
the
obscenity
itself.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
exactly
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
exactly
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
of
course
prior
restraints
per
se
as
--
hasn't
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional
by
the
court.
i
know
that
you
don't
look
with
great
favor
on
it
and
neither
do
i.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
a
factor
of
the
case.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
we
could
--
these
are
on
sale.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
a
number
of
cases
made
points
this,
made
this
point
that
if
you
have
to
pick
each
one
and
bring
an
action
on
it
is
not
nearly
so
effective
as
to
be
able
to
prescribe
all
those
that
fit
within
the
category
of
obscenity.
again,
i
say
yes
if
we
could
use
this
technique,
i
say
that
as
a
matter
of
practicality
if
the
states
can
be
given
the
authority
within
the
framework
of
the
first
amendment
to
suppress
obscenity,
it
should
be
given
the
authority
to
do
so,
otherwise
if
it's
impossible
to
do
it
procedurally
well,
then
we
should
follow
mr.
justice
black's
view
and
make
it
impossible
to
proceed
against
speech
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
oh!
that's
a
difficult
question
to
answer
your
honor.
it
will
take
generally
speaking
county
attorneys
would
estimate
90
days
is
about
an
average,
can
we
say
that
mr.
county
attorney.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
but
if
the
court
approves
this
procedure
by
affirming
this
case,
then
we'll
have
some
tools
which
if
delicately
used
i
think
we
can
make
some
progress
in
stemming
this
tide.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
mr.
chief
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
there
is
no
question
that
what
this
court,
if
it
wishes
to
make
that
determination
can,
if
it
wishes
to
make,
so
circumscribe
the
procedure
rules
it
may.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
as
such
has
only
brought
one
case.
i
think
many
cases
have
been
brought
by
the
county
attorneys.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
oh!
i
can't
tell
your
honor,
but
it's
fairly
common.
in
kansas
i
would
say
i
know
of
two
or
three
in
the
last
year.
the
only
thing
is
that
this
court
has
gone
so
far
to
protect
erotic
literature
we
don't
feel
that
girlie
magazines
for
instance
are
subject
to
any
seizure
and
destruction.
so
this
leaves
only
the
under
counter
and
this
paper
bag
pornography
which
is
the
under
counter
dressed
up
in
a
new
form
with
the
four
letter
words,
these
have
only
come
into
our
state
quite
recently
at
the
time,
we
filed
the
action.
the
cases
involving
the
under
counter
are
not
so
common
in
kansas
and
these
are
not
common
in
kansas
either,
these
books.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
there
are
on
open
shelves
of
the
book
stores
and
i
assume
they
come
through
mail,
i
can't
answer
that,
but
they
of
course
--
point
is
that
they
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
our
point
is
that
they
are
not.
thank
you.
