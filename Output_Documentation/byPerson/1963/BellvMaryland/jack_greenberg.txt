mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
petitioners
have
been
convicted
of
violating
article
27,
section
577
of
the
public
general
laws
of
maryland,
the
trespass
statute
which
is
the
same
statute
that
--
that
was
read
to
you
by
mr.
rauh
and
was
the
statute
that
was
involved
in
the
glen
echo
case.
they
were
indicted
on
a
two
count
indictment,
which
appears
on
page
6
of
the
record
stating
that
the
petitioner
unlawfully
did
enter
upon
and
cross
over
the
land
premises
and
private
property
of
a
certain
corporation
in
the
state
to
with
hooper
food
company,
inc.,
a
corporation,
after
having
been
dully
notified
by
albert
warfel,
an
agent,
not
to
do
so.
second
count
of
the
indictment
charges
that
they
entered
this
property
which
was
then
and
they
are
posted
against
trespassers.
they
were
found
guilty
on
count
one,
fine
$10
and
caused
the
fine
being
suspended.
they
were
acquitted
on
count
two.
petitioners
claim
that
their
convictions
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
criminal
proceedings
and
judgment
enforced
racial
segregation
against
them.
they
also
claim
that
the
judgments
below
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
under
the
indictment
and
statute
which
have
just
been
read.
or
if
it
were
to
be
held
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence,
the
indictment
statute
did
not
give
them
fair
notice
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
raised,
i
believe,
sufficiently
to
present
it
here
particularly
in
terms
of
the
free
speech
argument
and
i
think
vagueness
argument
and
free
speech
argument
are
really
different
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
not
raised
in
terms
but
i
think
it
was
raised
sufficiently
to
be
here
as
in
wright
against
georgia
and
other
cases
where
free
speech
and
vagueness
in
a
case
such
these
are
intimately
linked.
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
--
i
go
along
with
that.
i
think
we
argued
it
first.
i
don't
want
to
be
said
that
we're
adopting
it.
it
appears
at
length
in
our
certiorari
petition
and
in
our
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
let
him
characterize
it.
but
it
--
it
is
an
argument
upon
which
we
rely.
however,
we
will
not
argue
it
orally
because
this
is
the
only
argument
the
solicitor
makes
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
one
that
he
will
be
arguing
orally.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
in
many
respects
similar
to
the
facts
of
the
other
cases
which
have
just
been
argued.
june
17th,
1960,
a
group
of
15
to
18
negro
students
among
whom
where
the
petitioners
who
numbered
a
dozen,
entered
the
lobby
of
hooper's
restaurant
in
baltimore,
they
were
met
by
the
hostess
at
the
door
or
rather
within
the
restaurant,
beyond
the
door
and
she
stated,
"i
am
sorry
but
we
haven't
integrated
as
yet."
the
restaurant
manager,
mr.
warfel,
whose
name
appears
in
the
indictment,
came
up
at
this
point
and
began
to
talk
to
the
petitioners.
he
testified
that
he
told
them
it
was
company
policy
that
we
haven't
integrated
the
restaurant.
and
then
he
said
in
the
process
of
translating
the
company
policy,
the
group
broke.
they've
brushed
by
us
and
sat
at
various
tables
in
the
restaurant
and
after
they
were
seated,
they
proceeded
to
hedge
(inaudible)
which
is
explained
as
then
spreading
out
and
sitting
at
various
other
tables
in
the
restaurant.
the
owner
of
the
corporation
operating
the
restaurant
arrived
and
instructed
warfel
to
call
the
police.
when
the
police
arrived,
the
petitioners
were
seated
at
various
tables,
some
upstairs,
which
was
a
restaurant,
and
downstairs,
which
was
a
cafeteria
and
grill.
warfel
read
the
maryland
code
to
the
petitioners.
clerks
and
waitresses
took
down
their
names
and
then
mr.
hooper
went
to
the
magistrate
to
obtain
warrants.
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
refused
service
and
an
effort
was
made
to
eject
them
from
the
restaurant
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
color.
hooper
made
it
clear
that
he
agreed
with
the
petitioners'
objective.
he
testified
that,
"i
go
on
record
as
i
favor
what
you
people
are
trying
to
do."
he
also
said,
"i
told
mr.
(inaudible),
who
was
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
that
i
felt
personally
that
it
was
an
insult
to
human
dignity.
i
sympathize
with
it
and
also
told
them
that
my
customers
govern
my
policy."
petitioners'
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case
is
presented
in
three
parts
and
it's
essentially
the
same,
the
petitioners
have
made
in
the
--
in
the
cases
preceding
this
one
that
is
that
we
submit
that
the
arrest
and
conviction
here
served
only
to
enforce
the
racially
discriminatory
decision
of
the
owner
and
then
consequently,
under
shelley
against
kraemer,
which
was
argued
at
length
by
mr.
rauh
and
other
cases
holding
similarly.
the
state
has
participated
to
some
significant
--
significant
extent
in
enforcing
and
encouraging
racial
segregation
and
that
such
state
action
is
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
wholly
urge
such
an
argument
upon
the
court
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
has
been
argued
at
length
previously,
we
will
prefer
to
concentrate
in
this
oral
argument
upon
other
aspects
of
the
question.
petitioners
submit
--
submit
also
as
in
the
other
cases
that
the
choice
of
the
proprietor
was
not
an
authentically
private
decision
but
as
--
is
abundantly
demonstrated
by
the
record
was
influenced
by
the
custom
of
the
community.
in
fact,
this
--
in
this
case,
it
is
more
clear
that
in
any
other
because
mr.
hooper
said
that,
"i
wholly
believe
in
what
you're
trying
to
do.
i
completely
agree
with
you
and
sympathize
you
but
my
choice
is
influenced
by
the
community."
this
choice
of
the
community
in
turn,
we
submit,
was
to
some
significant
extent
and
that
is
the
terms
of
burden
to
a
significant
degree.
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
significant
has
been
influenced
by
historic
pattern
of
maryland
laws
which
had
the
purpose
of
sustaining
a
segregated
society.
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
upon
these
convictions
occurred,
maryland
had
not,
in
the
sense
that
has
been
suggested
here,
turned
the
corner
and
started
enacting
public
accommodations,
legislations
and
so
forth.
at
this
time,
the
maryland
was
a
state
without
laws
of
that
sort.
and
we
say
that
under
such
circumstances,
the
very
least,
state
action
should
be
held
to
have
a
role
in
state
custom
unless
something
to
the
contrary,
something
contrary
to
common
experience
to
show.
we
say
that
it
is
beyond
belief
that
a
state
such
as
maryland,
which
although
its
policy
is
now
in
the
process
of
change,
has
not
helped
to
create
and
shape
the
existing
state,
what,
segregation
custom.
well,
for
many
years,
it
has
had
a
statutory
policy
of
requiring
racial
segregation
in
many
institutions
of
public
life.
this
is
not
the
charge,
the
present
regime
in
the
state
with
wrong
doing
but
rather
simply
to
recognize
that
state
responsibility
for
a
custom
having
once
attached,
continuous
to
play
a
role
in
what
occurs
in
life.
and
to
this
extent,
we
submit,
the
state
continuous
or
at
least
at
the
time
of
this
conviction
certainly
did
continue
to
be
involved
to
a
significant
degree
in
the
manifestation
of
the
custom
which
it
had
helped
to
create,
shape
and
perpetuate.
it
maybe
that
--
that
a
simple
analogy
would
--
the
--
instructive
or
descriptive
it's
--
as
if
one
has
poisoned
the
well
and
then
later
repented
and
sought
to
cleans
it.
nevertheless,
some
of
the
residue
of
the
poison
remains
and
members
of
the
public
drink
it.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
man
who
poisoned
the
well
is,
to
some
significant
degree,
involved
in
the
owners
that
has
before
and
those
who
drank
the
water
even
though
he
has
repented
and
made
efforts
to
undo
what
he
did.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
both
occur
obviously.
customs
produce
laws
and
laws
produce
customs
but
to
the
extent
that
laws
produced
or
shaped
customs,
the
state
is
significantly
involved
in
them.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
sometimes
they
do,
sometimes
they
represent
either
the
enlightened
or
unenlightened
views
of
the
community
leaders
who
are
either
ahead
or
behind
of
the
community.
i
--
i
think
it
depends
on
the
law
and
the
situation.
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
the
other
but
i
think
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
the
--
once
the
law
is
on
the
books,
it
then
plays
a
role
in
influencing
and
--
and
educating,
encouraging
and
shaping
figure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
not
in
the
segregation
sense,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
on
page
30
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
covering
some
of
the
county
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
baltimore
has
an
ordinance
also,
this
has
happened
since
these
convictions.
in
addition
to
the
custom
argument
already
argued,
petitioners
would
urge
upon
the
court
other
fundamental
considerations
that
is
that
in
this
case,
as
in
the
other
cases
at
bar,
the
state
has
upheld
the
claim
of
the
proprietor,
in
this
case,
called
the
property
right
against
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
for
equal
treatment.
the
criminal
court
of
the
city
of
baltimore
has
held
as
a
matter
of
maryland
law,
in
the
absence
of
appropriate
legislation
forbidding
racial
discrimination,
the
operators
of
privately
owned
restaurants,
even
though
generally
open
to
the
public,
may
discriminate
against
persons
of
another
color
or
race
however
if
you're
unjust
such
a
policy
maybe
deemed
to
be.
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
held
in
the
context
of
the
racial
issue
in
this
case
that
private
citizens
retained
the
right
to
choose
their
guests
or
customers
and
furthermore,
that
this
and
maybe
enforced
by
the
criminal
law
of
the
state.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
the
neutral
declaration
of
a
common
law
that
always
was
and
emanated
from
nowhere
but
rather
the
expression
of
a
ranking
of
values
on
behalf
of
the
state
which
in
the
terms
of
erie,
we
quoted
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
transcendental
body
of
law
outside
of
any
particular
state
but
obligatory
within
it
unless
and
until
changed
by
statute.
and
justice
holmes,
as
a
number
of
times
written
in
the
same
effect
as
quoted
in
erie
and
--
and
in
our
brief.
but
the
law
of
property
of
a
state
and
its
ranking
of
property
claims
as
again
--
against
others
is,
we
submit,
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
held
in
marsh
against
alabama
and
shelley
against
kraemer,
that
property
rights
must
be
created
and
for
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
values
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
nature
of
their
constitutional
position
are
dominant.
the
state
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
when
it
ranks
above
these
values,
the
claim
of
a
proprietor
open
to
the
public
and
licensed
by
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
being
open
to
the
public,
the
right
to
exclude
some
persons
from
his
establishment
so
in
the
grounds
of
race.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
mapp
against
ohio,
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
poe
against
ullman
and
other
cases
indicate
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
which
in
the
--
the
case
of
a
private
home,
i
would
submit
,
would
be
dominate
against
something
of
this
sort.
i
think
the
public
place
can
make
no
such
claim
and
in
fact
is
so
thoroughly
regulated
that
--
that
it's
not
the
same
sort
of
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
if
it
were
a
genuinely
private
club,
yes.
it
--
it
would
partake
of
the
privacy
protection
if
it
were
a
--
a
sham,
a
--
a
place
open
to
the
public
under
the
name
of
the
club
and
there
have
been
cases
under
public
accommodations
statutes
to
this
effect
and
when
it's
been
found
to
be
a
club
it
has
been
held
to
would
have
the
right
to
make
choices
of
this
sort
no
matter
how
reprehensible.
and
when
it's
been
found
to
be
a
place
that's
going
under
the
name
of
a
club
just
to
be
able
to
discriminate
the
state
commission
that
you
said
you
can't
do
that.
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
result.
mr.
jack
greenberg
a
bind
cooperative?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
think
--
again,
i
--
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
operation
of
--
of
that
type
of
--
of
an
operation.
i
just
wouldn't
know.
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
how
genuinely
public
or
private
it
was.
i
just
don't
know.
i
once
belonged
to
a
cooperative
grocery
store
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
like
any
other
grocery
store
and
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
discriminate.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
were
some
element
of
privacy
in
it,
it
might
be
different.
the
church
case
we
discussed
early
this
morning
would
involve
considerations
of
first
amendment
rights
of
religion.
and
again,
i
don't
feel
that
it's
--
it's
necessary
to
argue
how
something
like
that
would
come
out
at
the
time
like
this.
i
think
that
the
values
to
the
--
the
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
are
--
are
fairly
clear.
it
is
the
position
of
petitioners
that
the
extent
that
this
ranking
is
in
the
form
of
the
application
of
state
power
or
refusal
to
act
to
protect
the
negro
citizen
in
this
claim
of
equal
service.
the
state
has
as
much
responsibility
as
if
it
has
affirmatively
sanctioned
the
exclusion
in
terms
of
--
of
positive
legislation.
state
inaction
in
various
circumstances
has
been
held
to
deny
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
burden
the
failure
of
the
state
to
insist
upon
a
non-discrimination
clause
and
at
least
would
play
a
role
in
the
decision
was
held
to
--
was
so
characterized.
terry
against
adams,
of
course,
was
a
case
in
which
in
most
views,
the
state
did
nothing
and
thereby,
state
action
in
the
constitutional
sense
appeared.
various
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
catlett
and
the
lynch
case
cited
in
our
briefs
take
the
issue
and
deem
the
civil
rights
cases
themselves.
this
court
assumed
that
the
states
were
living
up
to
their
responsibilities
in
taking
the
affirmative
action
necessary
to
protect
the
negro
citizens
and
only
in
view
of
this,
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
rendered
as
it
was.
the
form
that
the
state
protection
would
have
to
take
is
not
an
issue
at
this
point.
the
only
thing
petitioners
submit
is
that
a
fortiori,
certainly,
a
criminal
conviction
cannot
be
imposed
under
these
circumstances.
the
principle
argument
made
against
this
type
of
position
is
that
the
logic
leads
too
far
that
--
that
there
is
no
state
responsibility
here
because
it
would
lead
to
an
absurd
result
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
club
or
a
church
or
a
home.
i
notice
no
one
--
everybody
gives
the
case
in
terms
of
little
boy
asking
for
cigarettes
or
somebody
been
thrown
out
of
a
home
or
somebody
being
thrown
out
of
the
church
was
the
case
we
have
here.
it's
a
case
of
a
place
fully
opened
to
the
public,
fully
subject
to
regulation.
indeed,
due
process
of
law
is
not
taken
away
from
such
a
property
owner
when
a
state
requires
to
serve
negroes.
i
would
submit
due
process
of
law
would
be
taken
away
from
a
home
owner
if
he
were
required
to
have
a
guest
in
his
home
no
matter
what
the
race.
and
we
submit
that
these
reductio
ad
absurdum
arguments
are
self-defeating
because
by
being
so
far
removed
from
the
type
of
case
that
we
have
at
hand
here.
they
indicate
type
of
case
we
have
at
hand
is
one
surely
within
the
protections
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
would
not.
in
fact,
i
have
--
that's
my
case.
i
have
a
case
involving
not
a
lunch
counter
but
a
restaurant,
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
say
the
state
has
an
affirmative
responsibility
to
protect
and
form
that
would
take
is
--
involves
other
questions
but
certainly,
a
fortiori,
we
can't
have
an
arrest
and
a
conviction
and
--
and
we
would
submit
that
for
these
reasons,
the
conviction
in
this
case
should
be
reversed.
