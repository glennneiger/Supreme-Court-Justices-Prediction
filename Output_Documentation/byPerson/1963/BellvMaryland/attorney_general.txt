mr.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
certainly
different,
we
believe,
and
--
from
the
other
cases
presented
here
particularly
on
the
application
of
the
trespass
statute.
for
here,
there
was
a
warning
given.
the
petitioners
have
perhaps
crossed
over
the
manner
giving
the
warning
but
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
testimony
of
the
leader
of
the
group
(inaudible)
in
the
record
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
seek
themselves
in
the
restaurant
due
to
the
statement
of
the
hostess
that
they
had
not
integrated
yet.
and
the
trial
court
took
this
into
consideration,
if
you
will
note
the
opinion
of
judge
burns
in
the
court
below
where
he
noted
that
they
were
refused
seats
in
this
restaurant.
the
physical
layout
of
the
restaurant
is
perhaps
important
to
the
court's
decision
here
in
that
there
was
a
lobby.
the
petitioners
entered
the
restaurant
through
a
revolving
door
and
came
into
a
room
known
or
referred
to
in
the
record
as
the
lobby.
at
the
end
of
the
lobby,
arms
of
the
door
there
are
four
steps.
at
the
top
of
these
steps,
the
hostess
was
stationed.
and
it
is
the
common
practice
in
this
restaurant
for
the
hostess
to
see
all
customers
coming
into
the
dinning
area.
there
is
a
fence
separating
the
dining
room
and
the
lobby
in
this
restaurant.
now,
the
maryland
trespass
statute
not
only
prohibits
entry
but
it
prohibits
crossing
over.
these
petitioners
crossed
over
a
portion
of
the
premises
--
of
the
restaurant
premises
after
being
warned
not
to
do
so.
not
only
did
they
enter
the
dining
area
and
go
downstairs
after
warning,
they
crossed
over
a
portion
of
the
premises.
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
maryland
statute
prohibits.
the
--
there's
another
element
in
this
case
which
is
of
significance,
we
believe,
and
that
is
that
the
police
refused
to
arrest
the
petitioners.
the
polices
were
called
by
the
owner
some
time
after
the
petitioners
had
entered
the
restaurant
and
after
the
owner
and
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
had,
at
length,
conversed
with
the
leader
of
the
group
to
try
to
persuade
them
to
leave
peaceably.
he
explained
his
policy
to
them.
he
stated
that
he
was
segregating,
refusing
service
simply
because
his
customers
did
not
want
to
eat
with
negroes.
that
is
the
only
reason
he
gave.
the
police
were
called
by
the
owner
after
he
could
not
persuade
these
persons
to
leave
and
when
the
police
arrived,
they
refused
to
even
read
the
trespass
statute.
this
was
done
by
the
restaurant
manager
himself.
the
police
took
no
part
whatsoever
in
the
goings
on
in
the
restaurant
itself.
the
owner
had
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
police
station
to
swear
out
warrants.
he
went
down
to
police
station
and
the
--
the
magistrate
apparently
called
or
was
called,
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
which
by
the
petitioners
and
they
made
arrangements
to
voluntarily
come
down
to
the
court
the
following
monday
on
their
own
recognizance.
there
was
no
custody
taken.
there
was
no
arrest.
the
state
in
this
situation
is
certainly
a
neutral
party.
now,
we
feel
that
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
that
this
court
is
faced
with
a
square
decision
on
whether
state
criminal
trespass
conviction
of
negroes
protesting
racial
segregation
policy
in
a
private
restaurant,
in
a
private
building
constitutes
state
action
proscribed
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
where
neither
local
laws
nor
custom
requires
segregation.
now,
the
mere
recitation
of
--
did
statutes
does
not,
in
our
view,
constitute
any
state
custom
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
maryland.
as
far
back
as
1960,
chief
judge
thompson
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
district
of
maryland
in
a
case
in
which
custom
was
a
factual
matter
before
the
court
decided
in
slack
versus
atlantic
white
tower.
that
as
far
back
as
1957,
there
was
no
custom
of
segregation
in
--
in
maryland.
furthermore,
there
is
no
evidence
before
the
court
in
support
of
the
petitioners'
contention
that
there
was
such
a
custom.
on
the
other
hand,
the
petitioners'
leader
admitted
that
on
a
previous
occasion
or
on
several
previous
occasions,
in
the
same
general
area,
in
the
same
community,
they
had
sat
and
had
been
served
in
restaurants.
this
is
certainly
very
damaging
admission
on
the
part
of
the
chief
witness
for
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
says
in
this
case
if
they
had
been
served
in
other
restaurants
in
the
community.
certainly,
this
negates
any
community
custom
of
segregation.
there's
no
other
evidence
to
the
contrary
either.
the
owner
in
this
case
would
not
be
penalized
in
anyway
because
he
admitted
negroes.
there
would
be
no
state
action
that
could
be
taken
to
forcing
to
admit
negroes.
he
had
no
contract
with
any
other
restaurant
owners.
he
--
the
--
there
was
no
state
law,
there
was
no
state
policy,
there
was
no
state
action
on
any
--
in
any
respect
that
could
compel
the
restaurant
owner
here
to
segregate
his
facility.
on
the
question
of
licensing,
in
maryland,
there's
no
difference
between
the
licensing
of
a
club
in
which
persons
are
excluded
and
a
restaurant
except
where
the
facility,
no
matter
what
it
maybe,
is
operated
without
profit
to
the
operators.
and
this
is
the
only
distinction
made
in
the
licensing
statute
which
is
section
8
(a)
of
article
56
of
the
maryland
code.
the
health
statute
which
involves
the
regulation
by
the
state
on
the
grounds
of
sanitation
etcetera,
applies
to
all
facilities
whether
they'd
be
country
clubs,
private
eating
clubs,
whatever
they
may
be.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
in
that
case
there
was
a
--
a
rat
infestation
in
the
home
and
the
--
this
court
ruled
that
where
there
was
evidence
outside
the
home
that
there
was
such
a
rat
infestation
but
a
health
inspector
could
enter
the
house.
now,
the
maryland
statute
certainly
isn't
directed
at
sit-in
demonstrations
or
segregated
facilities
or
neither
this
sort
of
thing.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
prior
case
in
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
statute
was
tried
to
be
applied.
it
was
--
it
was
overruled
by
the
court
but
in
krause
versus
maryland,
the
court
stated
that
the
statute
at
the
least
would've
been
applicable
if
notice
had
been
given
in
a
case
where
there's
a
repossession
of
an
automobile
in
a
man's
property.
the
only
question
involved
there
was
that
whether
there
was
a
notice
given
and
the
court
there
found
there
was
no
such
notice.
the
owner
wasn't
there
at
the
time
and
that
the
people
went
on
the
property
and
the
only
forewarning
they
had
was
that
he
had
leaned
on
the
car.
the
--
all
trespassers,
regardless
of
their
race,
color,
sex,
color
of
hair
or
what
--
whatever
manner
that
they
--
or
whatever
characteristics
they
have
that
the
owner
of
private
property
in
maryland
that
wishes
to
call
into
play
to
forbid
their
entry
are
equally
guilty
under
the
maryland
trespass
statute.
if
a
woman
wants
to
go
into
a
stag
bar
and
the
owner
doesn't
wish
to
let
her
enter,
i
don't
think
that
she
could
call
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
situation.
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
nothing
about
race
or
color.
it
merely
says
a
state
shall
not
deny
equal
protection.
in
fact
this
court,
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
said
that
after
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
debates
in
congress
and
other
materials
available
at
the
time
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed,
the
time
the
civil
rights
bills
were
enacted
that
this
court
could
not
determine
with
any
certainty
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
aiming
at.
that
was
stated
in
the
--
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.so
i
think
that
the
remarks
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
this
regard
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
thirteenth
amendment
must
be
read
together
is
not
quite
the
meaning
which
was
given
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
this
court
on
that
occasion
nor
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
they
--
they
certainly
had
something
to
do
with
negro
rights
but
that
is
not
the
only
thing
that
they
had
to
do
--
deal
with.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
not
saying
that
they
are
not
applicable
and
in
fact,
it's
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they're
applicable
to
the
negro
situation
that
the
example
that
was
cited
by
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
believe
was
the
civil
rights
cases
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
there
as
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases
was
on
the
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
fifteenth
amendment,
again
in
your
theory
in
smith
versus
allwright,
does
state
that
the
--
the
right
to
vote
shall
not
be
denied
on
the
grounds
of
race
or
color
and
that's
clearly
such
case.
the
fourteenth
amendment
includes
a
--
a
whole
bundle
of
rights.
this
court
has
used
it
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
first
amendment
--
fifth
amendment
and
other
amendments
of
the
constitution.
it's
not
simply
a
protection
due
to
the
expression
that's
been
used
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
badge
of
slavery.
the
amendment
just
hasn't
been
determined
to
be
that
in
all
the
cases.
now,
it
can
hardly
be
said
here
than
that
the
state
compelled
or
coerced
or
mandated
or
commanded
the
discrimination.
if
the
court
to
--
the
state
here
had
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
decision
of
this
owner
to
segregate
his
particular
restaurant
nor
were
rights
that
are
constitutionally
protected
denied
to
the
petitioners.
now,
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
it
was
made
clear
that
there
must
be
an
abrogation
or
denial
of
rights
for
which
the
state
alone
could
be
held
responsible.
this
was
a
fundamental
wrong
that
was
intended
to
be
a
remedy.
the
distinction
that
can
be
applied
to
shelley
versus
kraemer
here,
i
think,
should
be
looked
down
in
the
light
of
some
other
situations.
for
instance,
where
there
is
a
--
a
will
in
which
there
is
a
testamentary
clause
which
prohibits
the
--
a
share
of
the
state
can
go
to
one
of
my
sons
who
marries
out
of
the
hebrew
faith,
such
was
the
case
in
gordon
versus
gordon
which
came
up
to
this
court
after
massachusetts
had
stated
that
such
a
discriminatory
clause
in
the
will
which
was
given
effect
by
the
courts
of
the
massachusetts
was
perfectly
valid.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case
and
another
situation,
the
girard
trustees
case
which
came
up
to
this
court
from
the
courts
of
pennsylvania.
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
prohibited
state
action
when
the
provisions
and
the
testamentary
instrument,
there,
the
will
of
girard,
set
up
a
trust
to
be
exercised
in
the
first
instance
when
the
case
came
up
before
this
court
by
the
city
of
philadelphia.
thrown
out
on
those
grounds
kept
--
court
in
pennsylvania
then
appointed
individual
trustees
which
continued
the
discriminatory
policy
of
this
girard
college
which
was
set
up
under
the
trust.
when
the
case
again
came
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
the
court
denied
certiorari.
now,
it's
hard
to
--
to
look
at
those
cases
or
it's
hard
to
justify
the
results
in
those
cases
with
the
result
sought
by
the
petitioners
here
on
the
grounds
of
state
action.
another
case
is
the
black
versus
cutter
lab
in
which
there
was
a
discriminatory
provision
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
actually
was
decided
in
this
court
not
to
be
a
grounds
of
state
action.
there
are
other
examples
that
perhaps
could
be
raised.
now,
several
cases
have
been
mentioned
to
this
court
as
--
today,
which
i
think
deserve
a
little
comment,
and
one
is
marsh
versus
alabama
that
--
and
comparing
that
with
terry,
for
instance,
to
find
that
some
positive
action
on
the
part
of
the
stage
called
for.
first,
it
should
be
born
in
mind
that
these
cases
involve
rights
that
were
reserved
by
other
amendments
of
constitution.
in
the
terry
case,
it
was
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
certainly
has
a
--
a
definite
connection
with
the
racial
issue
to
the
words
of
amendment
itself
and
perhaps
calls
for
a
stronger
state
action.
the
other
involves
the
first
amendment.
and
here,
we
don't
have
any
such
thing
that
here,
the
--
the
parties
that
came
on
to
the
property
and
--
were
refused
service
didn't
have
any
rights
to
be
there.
now,
the
mere
denial
of
the
rights
by
the
failure
to
give
them
redress,
certainly,
shouldn't
amount
to
state
action.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
gone
that
far.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that's
a
question
--
yes,
i
believe
that's
so.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
were
inside
the
--
they
were
inside
the
door.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
at
the
steps
where
the
hostess
was
located.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
what
did
who
say?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
were
told
weren't
segregate
--
weren't
integrated
yet.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
they
were
refused
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
were
refused
to
be
seated
at
that
time.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they're
--
they
were
not
permitted
to
be
seated.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
but
the
question
is
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
but
they
disregarded
what
the
hostess
said
and
they
crossed
over
to
where
the
seats
were.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
all
came
in
the
same
door.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
according
to
the
record,
they
were
cross
testimony
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
your
--
your
honor,
probably,
you're
speaking
of
the
testimony
of
the
owner
about
a
previous
incident
in
the
restaurant
where
some
of
the
people
went
into
the
bar.
in
this
case,
they
all
came
in
the
same
door
into
the
lobby.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
all
came
in
the
same
door
and
they
congregated
in
the
--
in
the
lobby.
after
the
refusal
to
let
them
be
seated,
part
of
them
pushed
by
the
hostess
and
reseated
in
the
dining
room
at
various
tables
and
the
others
went
down
the
steps
to
a
grill
which
is
in
the
basement
but
they
had
been
warned
prior
to
doing
this.
and
this
is
evident
from
the
--
their
own
leaders'
testimony,
pages
42
and
43.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
both
the
hostess
and
the
manager
had
warned
them.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
it
was
understood
to
me
in
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
and
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
petitioners,
if
--
if
i
remember
correctly
in
the
record,
says
that
they
were
refused
seats.
and
another
point,
he
says
that
they
knew
that
they're
going
to
be
arrested.
this
is
part
of
their
technique
of
demonstrating
in
this
restaurant.
it
could
be
said
that
they
had
actual
intent
to
be
arrested
in
this
case
as
part
of
their
technique
for
--
for
the
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
in
this
case,
it
would
your
crossing
over,
it
could
be
entry
too,
either
one.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
they
weren't.
there
was
another
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
very
definitely.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
simply
because
--
there's
another
maryland
statute,
section
576,
i
believe
it
is,
which
says
there
were
signs
are
posted
and
there
is
entry.
then
that's
the
crime.
now,
it
would
be
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
there
were
no
signs,
no,
sir.
but
whether
the
--
the
actual
crime
took
place
at
the
street
or
at
the
--
inside
the
lobby
doesn't
particularly
matter
here
as
long
as
the
facts
show
that
there
was
a
crime
committed,
and
merely
moving
out
to
the
street
doesn't
help
i
think.
on
the
question
of
vagueness,
certainly,
this
court's
decision
in
alford
versus
united
states
is
far
more
difficult
to
understand
than
what
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
now,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
crime
committed
if
a
statute
was
violated
whereas
in
--
in
alford
and
this
is
the
first
instance
that
anyone
had
come
up
under
this
situation,
in
alford,
there
was
a
statute
which
prevented
the
construction
or
the
building
of
a
fire
near
a
forest
in
the
public
domain,
that's
all
the
statute
said
and
the
man
was
convicted
for
building
a
fires
--
a
fire
near
the
forest.
now,
he
was
the
first
one
to
come
before
this
court
or
any
court
in
which
the
--
an
appellate
court
anyway,
determined
what
that
statute
meant.
and
the
court
upheld
the
conviction.
now,
certainly
maryland
statute
is
not
only
clear,
words
are
easy
to
understand
but
there
was
without
a
doubt
a
--
a
warning
not
to
enter
the
particular
parts
of
the
restaurant
where
the
petitioners
went
after
which
they
entered
and
crossed
over
of
those
portions.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
not
aware
of
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that
perhaps
in
that
case,
you
have
a
--
a
little
bit
different
construction
of
--
of
the
wording.
isn't
that
a
case
where
there
--
there
was
a
--
an
agency
which
determined
what
the
words
were.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
see.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
appreciate
your
suggestion.
well,
in
--
in
summary,
i
would
say
that
if
the
basis
of
constitutionality
of
such
conviction
is
neutrality
part
of
the
states
which,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
the
past
hundred
years,
appears
to
be
the
standard,
then
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
this
conviction.
if
anything
this
--
the
officers
of
the
state
here
discouraged
the
owner
from
bringing
the
case
even
in
the
court,
they
required
him
to
go
down
the
police
station
which
in
a
number
of
cases,
i
wouldn't
even
do.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
police
said
any
forewarning
of
the
--
the
incident
that
took
place
or
there
was
any
state
encouragement
of
the
--
the
segregation
policies
of
the
restaurant.
they
had
no
ownership
rights
in
the
building
or
the
--
or
the
--
of
the
restaurant
itself.
there
was
no
one
in
this
--
in
the
state
employee
that
was
working
there.
all
the
mitigating
factors
that
--
that
seem
to
valid
this
court
in
--
in
rendering
its
decisions
in
this
field
are
absent
in
this
case.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
easy
way
to
--
to
reach
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
primary
constitutional
issue
raised.
therefore,
the
state
of
maryland
respectfully
submits
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
