(inaudible)
questions
--
i
gather
you
--
you
indicate
that
--
that
is
proper
to
diffuse
political
power
into
the
thinly
populated
districts,
to
prevent
them
from
being
entirely
overridden
by
the
more
heavily
populated
districts.
and
at
the
same
time,
you
seem
to
indicate
that
the
heavily
populated
districts
retain
the
ability
to
take
care
of
themselves,
how
does
that
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they're
40%
in
the
--
40%
in
the
thiny
--
thinly
populated
districts
but
you
give
them
60%
of
the
votes
so
they
could
control
the
legislature.
the
60%
of
the
population
that
has
40%
in
the
legislature
can
take
care
of
themselves
for
the
governor,
this
is
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
take
to
override
a
veto
in
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
so
you
--
your
proposition
really
is
that
the
--
the
state
may
decide
--
divest
legislative
control
in
a
--
in
a
minority
portion
of
the
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
actually
the
way
your
legislature
operates
also
that
this
large
minority
does
control,
i
mean
are
there
really
bona
fide
issues
in
your
legislature
between
a
--
between
a
so-called
majority
and
the
minority
or
this
is
just
on
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
between
the
--
the
heavily
populated
and
the
thinly
populated
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
concurring
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
is
--
if
--
if
it's
an
actuality,
that
there
are
issues
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
and
this
is
the
way
they
vote
and
the
minority
controls
the
legislature
and
the
majority,
the
governor,
how
in
fact
this
have
the
--
the
heavily
populated
districts
taking
care
of
themselves?
i
mean
you
should
have
some
history
now,
you
say
they
--
they
really
aren't
badly
open
to
this
system,
the
--
the
--
they
take
care
of
themselves
through
their
large
share
of
both
houses
plus
the
help
from
the
--
from
the
chief
executive,
have
they
--
justice
byron

white
but
