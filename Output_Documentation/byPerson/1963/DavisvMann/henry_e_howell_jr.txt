mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
the
supreme
court.
there
is
no
locality
and
no
state
that
has
greater
need
for
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
norfolk
in
the
state
of
virginia.
in
the
short
time
that
i
have,
i
intend
to
direct
my
attention
to
reemphasize
the
rank
raw
discrimination
that
was
perpetrated
upon
the
people
of
norfolk
by
the
statutes
under
attack.
and
to
eliminate
once
and
for
all,
i
hope,
the
mirage
of
rationalization,
any
mirage
in
rationalization
that
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
of
virginian
may
have
created
with
reference
to
eliminating
from
consideration
any
right
of
representation
on
behalf
of
citizens
who
have
the
military
for
an
occupation
and
who
have
always
constituted
an
important
part
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
norfolk.
i'll
go
to
a
fundamental
that
we
are
here
with
an
affirmative
opinion
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
written
by
judge
albert
v.
bryan
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
who
has
been
bred
and
born
in
the
tradition
of
virginia,
who
has
served
as
commonwealth's
attorney
of
the
city
of
alexander
for
well
over
a
decade,
who
has
appeared
on
constitutional
questions
before
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
who
is
specially
appointed
to
counsel
and
who,
as
i
say,
was
learned
in
the
traditions
of
virginia.
and
i
think
that
we
should
go
to
some
of
the
facts
on
which
the
lower
court
relied
in
handing
down
that
opinion,
namely
that
insofar
as
norfolk
is
concerned,
when
the
legislature
refused
to
constitute
a
sturdy
commission
of
its
own
body
after
it
adjourned,
governor
allman
(ph)
had
to
appoint
a
special
study
commission
so
that
they
might
have
time
to
consider
the
complexities
of
reapportioning
and
re
--
redistricting
the
state
of
virginia.
that
was
composed
of
learned
lay
people
and
learned
legislators
from
all
over
virginia
from
representative
sections
throughout
the
wheat
and
bread
for
the
state.
they
in
turn
permission
the
bureau
of
public
administration
of
the
university
of
virginia
to
give
impartial
consideration
to
these
problems
and
the
bureau
of
public
administration
came
up
with
two
plans
for
the
senate,
senate
plan
a
and
b
and
both
of
those
plans
awarded
norfolk
a
third
senator.
it
came
up
with
three
alternative
plans
for
the
house
of
delegates,
plans
a,
b
and
c
for
the
house.
and
in
each
of
those
plans,
norfolk
was
awarded
an
additional
delegate
to
raise
us
to
seven
based
upon
an
increase
in
population
of
a
little
in
excess
of
90,000
during
the
10-year
period
from
1950
to
1960
when
the
hoover
commission,
the
name
of
the
delegate
who
headed
the
commission
was
mr.
lawrence
hoover.
when
the
hoover
commission
went
over
these
plans
of
the
bureau
of
public
administration,
they
took
a
little
of
assault,
took
political
realities
and
they
(inaudible)
down
the
per
capita
representation
but
even
with
that
political
assaulting
out
of
the
hoover
commission,
came
a
recommendation
firm
and
clear
that
norfolk
was
entitled
to
a
third
senator
and
a
seventh
delegate.
those
overpowering
facts
from
considered
members
of
both
the
lay
and
the
legislature
cannot
be
blinked
at
on
appeal
by
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
i
submit.
now
i
want
to
get
swiftly
and
quickly
to
the
rankness
and
the
rawness,
i
submit,
of
the
discrimination
perpetrated
upon
the
city
of
norfolk.
each
of
norfolk's
two
senators
represent
roughly
152,000
people
and
the
adjacent
city
of
chesapeake,
only
73,000
people
are
necessary
to
give
them
an
additional
senator.
now
the
--
for
example
a
norfolk
delegate
represents
50,000
people
and
a
delegate
from
shenandoah
represents
only
21,000
people.
this
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
people
of
norfolk
is
underlined
by
the
fact
that
a
community
which
has
twice
the
influence
in
the
state
senate
is
immediately
adjacent
to
the
city
of
norfolk.
how
more
invidious
can
discrimination
be
than
where
a
neighbor
jones
residing
in
norfolk
realizes
that
the
common
fence
he
shares
with
his
neighbor
in
the
city
of
chesapeake
marks
a
line
of
demarcation
for
political
influence
which
exceeds
his
by
more
than
100%.
bringing
it
down
even
clearer,
if
we
could
conceive
that
congress
would
decree
that
justice
harlan
should
be
paid
$40,000
a
year
and
justice
stewart
$20,000
a
year
merely
because
of
the
seats
that
they
occupy
before
this
honored
court.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
unfortunately,
that
cannot
be
done
in
legislative
seats.
for
example,
it
has
been
suggested
perhaps
by
justice
stewart
that
--
that
the
people
in
chesapeake
would
look
out
for
the
people
in
norfolk
and
the
people
now,
was
a
county
of
princess
anne
and
now
the
city
of
virginia
beach
would
look
out
for
the
people
of
norfolk.
two
weeks
ago,
our
city
council
had
to
go
to
the
bank
and
borrow
money
to
run
our
public
school
system
waiting
for
the
taxes
to
be
raised
because
virginia
governmental-wise
has
withered
to
a
philosophy
known
as
pay-as-you-go
and
the
state's
out
of
debt
but
the
cities
are
in
debt
over
their
head.
we
wanted
to
have
a
payroll
tax
in
norfolk
so
that
the
people
living
in
chesapeake
and
working
in
norfolk
would
have
to
pay
a
portion
of
our
tax
and
so
that
the
people
living
in
princess
anne
on
the
city
of
virginia
beach
and
working
in
norfolk
would
have
to
pay
a
part
of
that
tax.
we
had
to
get
that
through
the
legislature
in
order
to
have
payroll
tax
in
the
league
of
--
the
league
of
counties
which
only
includes
two
cities,
that's
chesapeake
and
virginia
beach,
they're
only
two
cities
allowed
in
that
league
and
that
league
says,
"no,
we
won't
vote
for
any
payroll
tax."
that's
the
protection
of
the
economic
selfishness
of
each
individual
but
it
just
shows
you
that
we've
got
to
go
at
alone
and
we
badly
need
every
green
button
that
we
can
get
in
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
and
i
--
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we're
talking
about
our
very
real
thing
and
that
each
year
that
it
goes
by,
that
we
are
out-weighted
2-to-1
and
our
representation
means
this,
that
tomorrow,
a
special
session
of
virginia
general
assembly
convenes
for
the
people
that
i
represent
in
norfolk
with
great
majority
or
against
a
poll
tax
which
is
locked
in
political
control
in
virginia
for
over
half
a
century
where
only
30%
of
the
adults
bothered
to
go
to
the
polls
tomorrow
when
--
to
--
wednesday,
i
think
the
governor
expects
to
have
the
public
hearings
and
everything
ready
for
it
to
roll
and
we
need
desperately
to
have
a
green
button
added
to
our
delegates
so
that
seven
buttons
will
show
in
the
house
of
delegates
and
three
buttons
will
show
in
the
senate
as
we
try
to
do
away
with
the
--
with
the
poll
tax.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes,
the
green
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
and
red
is
--
red
is
no
and
we
watch
that
panoramas,
it
goes
up
and
--
and
that
is
the
stuff
for
government
in
virginia.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
and
we've
been
struggling
hard
in
norfolk
to
--
to
get
equal
representation
and
it
has
been
somewhat
difficult.
if
your
honor
please,
now
getting
to
this
military
mirage,
i
say,
this
case
is
unique.
we
have
had
--
some
people
suggested,
it's
alright
to
have
20-to-1
discrimination
but
this
is
the
only
state
attorney
general
who
stood
up
and
say,
"give
no
representation
to
110,000
individuals
on
a
community.
they
want
to
excise
and
exclude
from
any
representation
and
these
people
are
just
not
on
ships,
they're
with
us
for
three
years
or
longer
as
they
take
their
shore
leaves
and
many
of
them
leave
their
families
with
us
because
there're
only
three
or
four
ports
that
you're
going
to
live
with
--
in
the
--
in
the
united
states
and
they're
back
with
us."
and
furthermore,
i
want
to
bring
out
to
the
court
the
fact
that
no
evidence
was
produced
before
the
three-judge
court
on
this
military
idea
except
the
vast
census
in
--
in
the
bluebook
of
the
census
and
judge
bryan
said,
"furthermore,
it
was
hardly
helpful
talking
about
these
census
statistics
for
it
was
conceded
that
servicemen
and
women
could
and
many
of
them
do
qualify
to
--
to
vote."
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
roughly
304,000
people.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
we
estimate
40
some
thousand.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
head
of
the
family
and
that's
a
man.
they
take
a
theoretical
figure
of
two
and
a
half
and
multiply
that.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
could
not
stand
here
with
reliability
but
it's
been
fairly
stable
since
the
--
since
the
conclusion
of
world
war
ii
and
the
temporary
people
returned
to
their
homes.
the
navy
does
not
draft,
you
have
to
volunteer
to
be
in
the
navy
and
so
we
don't
have
any
draftees,
we
more
or
less
have
people
that
have
selected
that
for
a
tenure
of
period
--
a
certain
period
of
time.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
and
--
and
the
great
percentage
of
them
get
shore
duty
at
--
you
have
shore
duty
for
a
certain
period
of
time
and
you're
on
a
ship
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
exactly
in
their
tax
sir,
they
have
to
pay
automobile
taxes
when
they
park
their
trailers.
they
have
to
pay
a
tax
for
that.
they
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
the
homes
that
they're
buying
under
the
fha
and
the
veterans
administration
financing
facilities.
they
pay
--
they
pay
taxes
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
as
to
--
after
they
have
been
there
one
year
and
they
may
vote
if
they
will
say
that
we
have
no
present
intention
of
abandoning
virginia
as
our
home,
we
--
we
like
it
here
and
we're
going
to
stay
here
as
long
as
we
can.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
--
none
whatsoever
in
the
record
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there
should
have
been
any
mention
of
the
state
court
suit
which
was
bought
to
enjoin
the
democratic
primary
and
to
enjoin
the
general
election
we
just
held
and
hopes
that
we
could
get
this
third
senator
and
seventh
delegate
for
the
tomorrow's
special
session
or
certainly,
next
week's
general
session.
we
thought
we
had
a
federal
right
that
the
state
court
would
reverse
but
in
that
the
--
they
--
they
slipped
this
state
court
testimony
in
there
but
they
do
not
hope
mrs.
(inaudible),
our
deputy
of
registrar,
when
she
asked
and
has
--
and
there
is
no
way
of
telling
how
many
of
the
63,923
people
that
were
registered
in
the
city
of
norfolk
as
of
april
1,
1963
went
to
military
service,
answer,
no
sir.
she
had
no
way
of
telling
her,
she
could
tell
us
how
many
may
have
voted
but
she
couldn't
tell
us
how
many
of
them
over
the
period
of
years,
have
registered.
but
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
extraneous
and
--
and
strange
record
which
i
feel
is
not
exactly
an
order
from
my
friends
to
have
slipped
in
--
in
harshly,
we
might
say.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
unless
they
select
another
state
as
--
as
their
state,
they
are
amenable
to
the
state
income
tax,
if
your
honor
please.
but
here
is
a
very
significant
fact
that
in
the
lower
court,
not
a
single
legislator
was
produced,
not
a
single
state
employee
was
produced
to
offer
any
testimony
concerning
the
lack
of
rhyme
or
reason
or
the
presence
of
rhyme
or
reason
of
a
rationale.
if
before
the
lower
court,
they
had
suggested
that
our
increase
in
90,000
people
was
due
to
an
increase
in
the
military
forces
in
virginia,
we
would
have
countered
with
the
judicially
established
fact
that
in
1952
thereabouts,
we
annexed
a
portion
of
the
city
of
chesapeake,
then
norfolk
county
and
took
in
55,000
people
living
in
--
who
moves
there
in
that
area.
and
we
would
have
shown
them
that
by
judicial
decree,
we
were
permitted
to
annex
a
portion
of
princess
anne
county
and
took
in
38,000
people
and
they
are
the
90,000
people
that
we
need
to
represent.
people
that
we
have
annexed
from
our
adjacent
territories
in
order
to
give
us
oddly
room
in
which
to
grow
as
a
large
municipal
--
municipality
there.
and
then
i
would
hastily
move
on,
if
your
honor
please,
to
show
you
that
our
entire
history
and
tradition
has
been
to
count
the
military
and
it
appalls
me
to
--
to
hear
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
suggest
that
we
haven't
--
in
9th
--
traditionally
and
historically,
virginia
responding
to
the
roots
of
thomas
jefferson
and
those
early
founding
fathers
have
used
population
as
the
keystone.
all
those
legislators
in
recent
years,
population
was
not
so
stable
as
it
was
and
they're
becoming
more
reluctant
to
hue
to
those
well
established
historic
principles
but
in
1922,
norfolk
got
an
additional
delegate
based
upon
our
total
population
established
by
the
united
states
and
its
census
including
military
population.
in
1950,
the
legislature
refused
to
reapportion
it
all.
they
went
home
and
governor
battle,
had
to
call
a
special
session
because
the
people
of
the
state
rows
up
and
say,
"you
cannot
blink
at
this
mandate."
they
came
back
and
our
now
present
governor,
albertis
harrison,
was
then
a
state
senator
who
had
served
on
the
redistricting
the
committee
and
he
recommended
that
norfolk
receive
an
additional
delegate
in
1952,
30
years
since
we've
gotten
anything
in
1922
and
he
cited
as
the
figure
to
justify
this
increase,
the
total
population
census
is
established
by
the
united
states
census
and
in
that
special
session,
we
got
an
additional
delegate
based
upon
our
total
population.
and
now,
it
seems
somewhat
contradictory
that
his
attorney
general
is
saying
that
we
shouldn't
have
now
what
we
have
had
in
1922
and
--
and
1952.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
100,000
piece
of
the
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
they
took
away
a
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
it
--
it
compares
relatively
good
--
relatively
good,
if
your
honor
please
but
as
we've
said,
the
--
the
--
we
cannot
condemn
because
a
boy
or
a
girl's
father
has
chosen
the
military
as
an
occupation
and
they
move
into
to
norfolk
to
stay
for
an
average
period
of
three
years,
who
are
going
to
our
schools.
the
federal
government
under
public
law
115,
pays
an
increment
to
norfolk
for
their
schools
and
they
should
have
a
say
in
the
legislature
to
see
how
that
federal
money
that
the
government
sends
down
as
to
be
apportioned.
they're
using
the
roles
and
all
of
the
stuff
of
government
which
is
the
only
justification
for
a
state
government.
they
need
as
bad
as
anyone
else.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
you
take
away
100,000
people
from
us
because
they
are
militarily
connected,
we
could
not
complain.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
oh.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no
--
no
--
no
ground
--
the
only
urban
--
the
urban
rule
argument
is
the
only
argument
that
mr.
mcilwaine
suggested.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
if
your
honor
please.
on
that
score,
i
wrote
out
here,
"virginia
is
a
crazy
quilt
when
measured
by
the
legal
criteria
but
it
is
a
skillfully,
closely
woven
and
almost
invisible
net
when
measured
by
the
intent
of
a
political
machine
bought
half
a
century
ago
to
maintain
power.
those
communities
there
can
be
found
rhyme
or
reason
for
this
crazy
quilt.
those
communities
that
are
politically
manageable
in
virginia
were
favored
and
those
who
had
shown
some
sort
of
independence
were
disfavored
and
the
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
no
sir,
that's
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
we
--
we
--
we
--
you
cannot
read
the
minds,
it's
too
finely
woven,
too
invisible.
all
we
can
say,
it's
a
crazy
quilt,
they
cannot
be
rationalized.
why
should
shenandoah
have
22,000?
why
should
culpeper
outweigh
us
2-to-3-to-1?
why
should
princess
anne
county,
with
the
same
type
of
transit
population
as
we
have,
they
have
30%
military
connected
personnel,
we
have
30%.
they
give
them
an
additional
delegate
in
the
last
legislature
and
they
give
us
none.
why
shouldn't
chesapeake
be
joined
with
(inaudible)
county
as
recommended
by
the
hoover
commission,
so
that
they
would
roughly
have
one
senator
for
a
100,000
--
110,000
people,
rather
than
one
senator
for
70
some
thousand
people.
it's
a
crazy
quilt,
we
go
no
further
but
we
say
that
if
--
if
it
had
been
any
justification,
they
would
have
put
on
an
able
legislator
on
able
state
employee.
they'd
put
on
--
put
on
none.
i
want
to
say
that
if
were
to
extend
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
of
what
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
there's
no
rhyme
or
reason.
there's
no
rationale
to
the
discrimination
that
we
have
proven
by
their
use
of
per
capita
population.
i
would
want
to
show
that
in
my
brief
or
maybe
it's
not
in
the
brief
but
in
1867,
they
convened
a
convention
and
there
was
an
effort
to
make
registered
voters
the
criteria
for
reapportionment.
and
on
january
11,
1868,
it
was
disregarded,
it
was
lost
and
there
never
has
been
an
attempt
in
virginia
since
then
to
use
registered
voters
and
a
natural
extension
of
--
of
that
argument
of
excising
military
would
be
to
excise
young
people
and
excise
anyone
who
is
not
qualified
to
vote
in
historic
that
we
abandon
that
in
--
in
virginia
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i
--
i
do
sir
--
i
do
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
you
can
--
you
can
meet
the
--
the
demands
of
a
republican
form
of
government
with
respect
to
state
governments
without
giving
each
inhabitant
of
that
locality,
young,
old
or
middle-aged
a
--
a
weight
in
the
legislature
through
his
delegate.
he
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
even
though
they're
not
qualified
because
there's
only
one
justification
for
a
state
government,
to
furnish
services
that
the
individual
cannot
furnish
him
for
himself.
to
furnish
roads,
to
furnish
schools,
to
regulate
power
and
light
rates
and
so
forth
and
its
people
that
create
these
problems.
the
legislature
is
merely
a
mirror
reflecting
the
people
behind
him
when
he
goes
to
the
legislature
and
we
must
--
in
order
to
have
influence
and
impact
for
these
people
who
create
the
problems
for
which
state
got
--
government
is
the
only
justification
we
must
adhere
closely
to
a
per
capita
of
approach
for
representing
--
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
the
very
able
and
imminent
solicitor
general
made
that
suggestion,
if
your
honor
please,
but
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it,
i
hope
its
not
over
simplification,
we're
not
talking
about
a
federal
government
involved
with
international
policy
or
anything
else.
we
just
talk
about
the
bread
and
butter
of
existence
which
is
the
only
justification
for
a
state
government,
not
--
not
for
high
philosophical
policies
or
anything.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
exactly
head
for
head.
mr.
henry
e.
howell,
jr.
yes.
but
substantially,
it
must
be
per
capita
for
us
to
have
a
healthy
state
government
that
is
keeping
up
with
the
times
and
keeping
in
the
mainstream
of
the
demands
of
human
beings
and
this
the
latter
half
of
the
20th
century.
otherwise,
we're
going
to
get
disgruntled
people,
we're
going
to
get
people
who
--
who's
problems
cannot
be
solved,
and
i
close
if
your
honor
please,
by
submitting
that
the
law
will
not
permit
latter
day
virginia
politicians
to
bankrupt
virginia
state
in
a
republican
form
of
government,
that
it
is
--
that
is
equally
responsive
to
all
people
of
virginia,
the
labor,
the
doctor,
the
lawyer,
the
merchant
chief,
the
soldier,
sailor
and
airman,
the
little-old
lady
and
the
brand
new
baby.
people
are
people,
all
people
are
people.
thank
you.
