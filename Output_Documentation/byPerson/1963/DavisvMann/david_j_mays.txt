mr.
david
j.
mays
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
pleases.
it
is
my
purpose
to
briefly
give
the
frame
of
government
we
have
in
virginia
insofar
as
our
legislature
is
concerned
and
then
take
up
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
which
i
think
has
not
been
referred
to
in
any
of
the
other
cases
and
carry
it
beyond,
at
least
one
step
beyond,
the
normal
presentation
of
that
doctrine
because
i
believe
it
leads
us
to
where
baker
should
ultimately
go.
and
my
colleague,
the
assistant
attorney
general,
mr.
mcilwaine
will
deal
with
the
precise
figures
which
have
been
used
in
the
various
districts,
both
senate
and
house
in
virginia.
at
the
outset,
i
should
say
that
we
have
a
bicameral
legislature.
we
have
a
senate
which
by
our
constitution
must
consist
of
33
to
40
numbers
and
a
house
of
90
to
100
members
in
actual
practice
they
don’t
exist
in
statues
and
for
a
long
time
it
is
always
meant
the
maximum
allowed
so
that
we
have
in
virginia
40
senators
and
100
members
of
the
house.
the
members
of
the
house
are
elected
for
2-year
terms
and
the
senate
before.
the
elections
were
held
tuesday
of
last
week.
there
will
be
no
more
general
elections
for
two
years.
in
order
to
give,
however,
my
adversaries
the
full
advantage
of
time,
we
do,
although
we
have
our
elections
in
november,
one
must
give
notice
in
april
for
the
primaries,
but
even
with
that,
we
are
one
year
and
a
half
away
so
far
as
the
house
is
concerned
and
three
years
and
a
half
away
so
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned.
i
might
say
that
our
regular
sessions
are
in
even
years,
beginning
early
january
had
limited
to
60
days
by
our
constitution.
there
has
not
been
yet
a
meeting
of
our
general
assembly
since
the
instant
case
was
instituted.
now,
we
have
one
constitutional
provision
dealing
with
the
matter
of
apportionment.
section
43
provides
and
i
quote
it
in
full,
"the
present
apportionment
of
the
commonwealth
in
the
senatorial
and
house
districts
shall
continue,
but
a
reapportionment
shall
be
made
in
the
year
1932
and
every
10
years
thereafter.”
i
might
say
there
that
this
was
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
in
1928
when
a
number
of
amendments
were
made,
but
it
is
the
same
language
except
for
bringing
it
--
up
to
date
as
in
the
convention
of
1901
and
1902
which
was
the
last
constitutional
convention
we
had
in
virginia
except
for
limited
purposes.
mr.
david
j.
mays
1902.
mr.
david
j.
mays
1902.
mr.
david
j.
mays
the
convention
began
in
1901.
there
was
a
long
adjournment
and
the
constitution
was
finally
promulgated
in
1902.
now,
pursuant
to
that
requirement
of
the
constitution,
our
general
assembly
of
virginia,
beginning
immediately
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
itself,
not
merely
this
amendment
has
regularly
ever
dissenting,
reapportioned
the
state
of
virginia
both
senate
and
the
house
and
there'd
been
some
occasions
on
which
it
acted
more
frequently,
so
there's
been
no
failure
here
ever
as
in
the
case
of
baker.
now,
the
current
statutes,
sections
24-14
and
24-12
are
those
which
deal
with
the
matter
of
apportionment
and
as
you
will
see,
if
under
that
that
the
general
assembly
determines
the
composition
that
is
by
districts
of
both
house
and
senate.
now,
virginia
had
at
the
time
of
the
last
apportionment
98
counties
and
34
cities.
that's
been
changed
slightly
since,
but
you
can
appreciate
from
that
and
i
don't
want
to
trespass
on
my
colleague's
presentation
but
i'll
merely
mention
this
thing,
you
will
see
from
that
that
it
is
not
possible
to
avoid
grouping
counties
or
grouping
counties
and
cities
or
possibly
having
more
than
one
representative
from
a
large
community.
and
so
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes.
mr.
david
j.
mays
entirely
independent
in
every
instance,
yes
and
the
cities
that
i
referred
to
are
all
independent
of
the
counties.
now,
we
have
towns
which
are
part
of
the
county,
but
the
cities
themselves
have
a
complete
separate
political
identity.
mr.
david
j.
mays
not
at
all.
they
have
no
connection
with
the
county
government
in
any
fashion.
now,
we
also
have
traditionally
and
we
have
felt
it
wise
not
to
divide
cities
and
not
to
divide
counties
when
we
work
out
our
legislative
apportionment.
and
the
result,
of
course,
is
that
we
do
have
sometimes
several
counties,
represented
by
one
delegate
or
one
senator
and
sometimes,
as
i
said,
we
will
have
more
than
one
senator
and
more
than
one
delegate
for
a
large
city
and
in
the
end
we
wind
up
with
36
senatorial
districts
and
40
house
districts.
our
population
now
is
barely
under
4,000,000,
probably
it's
little
more
now
but
it
was
that
when
we
had
the
last
census
and
at
that
time
having
100
members
of
the
senate.
each
one
of
them
represented
99,174
persons
if
we
simply
use
mathematics,
in
other
words,
100,000
and
in
the
house,
39,669
using
exact
mathematics
or
roughly
40,000.
the
extreme
disparities
taking
everybody
mentioned
in
the
census
taking
every
sailor
who
happened
to
be
on-board
ship
and
move
it
in
the
harbor
of
norfolk
on
the
5th
of
april
1960,
the
--
the
extreme
disparity
in
the
house
is
4.36-to-1.
the
extreme
disparity
in
the
senate
is
2.65-to-1,
those
are
the
extremes.
i
should
add
to
this
picture
that
virginia,
now
calling
to
the
exhibit
prepared
by
the
people
in
political
science
in
the
university
of
virginia
and
which
is
a
part
of
our
record
here,
i
think
about
265,
indicates
that
virginia's
stands
eighth
of
the
50
states
in
its
degree
of
what
they
call
representativeness,
that's
for
the
whole
country.
it's
true
they
did
not
have
the
figures
for
maryland
and
i
think
two
other
states
at
the
time
that
was
computed,
but
i
don't
think
it
will
change
the
picture
in
the
slightest
and
so
we
stand
as
i
say
in
eighth
place
in
the
entire
nation.
mr.
david
j.
mays
it
has
--
it
does
not
express
any
particular
standard.
mr.
david
j.
mays
well
the
best
answer
i
can
give
is
there
is
no
limitation
how
that
would
be
construed
by
our
supreme
court,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
it
has
never
been
done,
but
there
is
no
standard
that
is
prescribed
in
the
constitution
itself.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes
sir.
now,
since
this
suit
was
instituted,
i
better
go
back,
i
should
say
this
as
a
concession,
that
to
be
one,
that
our
constitution
cannot
be
amended
by
any
direct
action
of
the
people.
there
is
no
initiative,
there
is
no
referendum
in
virginia
and
the
only
method
of
amending
our
constitution
or
calling
a
constitutional
convention
is
through
the
general
assembly
itself.
we
feel,
and
this
may
be
gratuitous,
that
our
general
assembly
has
been
for
all
these
many
decades
responsive
to
the
people
and
we
haven't
had
no
great
problem
in
having
things
initiated
because
we
do
not
have
a
wide
disparity.
and
while
i'm
on
that,
although
it
takes
40-some
percent
of
the
people
of
virginia
and
no
more
than
that
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
senate
and
only
40
some
percent
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
house,
there
is
no
state,
may
i
repeat,
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
according
to
this
compilation
made
by
the
political
science
of
the
university
of
virginia
which
elects
its
senate
or
its
house
by
a
majority
of
its
citizens,
not
one.
it
never
reaches
50%.
it
is
always
a
minority
and
when
we
talk
about
majorities
therefore,
we're
dealing
with
a
theory
which
has
not
been
reached
in
fact
anyway.
now,
when
this
case
was
brought
before
the
three-judge
court,
norfolk
came
in
and
intervened,
some
norfolk
voters,
and
the
same
counsel
who
represented
intervenors
there
is
now
representing
two
new
plaintiffs
in
one
of
the
trial
courts
in
richmond.
i
come
to
that
because
it
deals
initially
with
this
subject
of
abstention.
may
i
say
that
again,
the
general
assembly
has
not
met
since
this
case
was
brought
--
since
the
instant
case
was
brought.
the
courts
have
not
been
availed
out
except
in
one
instance,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
story
now,
we
do
not
have
the
tennessee
situation
at
all.
they
are
not
locked
up
in
the
general
assembly.
they
are
not
locked
up
in
the
courts.
they
are
free
to
come
to
its
open
doors.
let
me
go
back
to
the
case,
this
case
in
the
three-judge
court.
there
we
have
the
voters
from
two
--
two
political
entities
in
northern
virginia
just
outside
of
washington
who
came
in
asking
relief
and
norfolk
through
the
present
counsel
here,
intervened.
they
sought
protection
and
they
were
a
bit
[inaudible]
when
they
found
that
there
was
a
stay.
and
when
this
court
granted
a
stay,
then
counsel
for
the
intervenors
from
norfolk
began
an
independent
suit
which
obviously,
he
knew
he
could
have
done
all
along
in
norfolk
and
made
party
as
defendant
state
election
officials.
it
so
happens
that
in
virginia,
if
you
are
suing
an
official
of
the
state,
i
don't
mean
suing
the
state,
i
mean
suing
an
official,
you
have
to
bring
that
suit
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
those
officers
and
so
the
cause
which
transferred
there
but
except
for
bringing
that
about,
we
who
defended
him
did
not
anything
at
all
to
slow
down
the
presentation
of
that
case
in
the
court.
we
filed
our
answer
promptly.
we
not
only
filed
it
without
any
dilatory
pleas,
we
not
only
filed
our
answer
promptly
but
we
went
a
step
beyond
the
injunctive
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiff
and
said,
"let's
bring
it
all
on
now
and
get
it
finished."
and
we
answered
and
then
in
the
cross
bill
asked
with
this
--
the
whole
question
be
determined
under
declaratory
judgment
act
of
virginia.
the
other
side
came
in
and
joined
in
that
in
our
answer
and
we
came
before
that
court.
the
court
had
him
a
prompt
hearing
and
rendered
an
opinion
which
was
against
them
and
an
honor
was
made
and
that
was
a
month
or
more
ago.
that
court
is
a
trial
court
but
there
is
no
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
virginia.
you
go
from
that
court
straight
to
our
court
of
appeals.
that
court
docket
is
--
is
current,
they
can
go
there
now.
no
step
has
been
taken
unless
it's
been
in
the
last
few
days
and
i
suppose
it
won't
be
until
we
leave
here.
what
they're
offering
now
to
go
to
a
court
which
can
give
them
relief.
now
it
was
--
forbid
obtaining
and
naïve,
i
thought
in
the
appellees
brief
when
they
said
yes
but
they
didn't
do
what
we
wanted
them
to
do.
well,
that
happens
to
lawyers.
occasionally,
courts
don't
do
what
we
want
them
to
do.
the
point
is
though,
the
court
heard
them.
they
gave
them
their
day
and
they
are
free
now
to
appeal
and
come
on
up
to
our
state
court
in
order
to
have
a
final
determination
insofar
as
our
own
state
system
is
concerned.
i
don't
mean
to
label
that.
i
do
say
though
that
they
haven't
done
with
the
general
assembly
and
they
are
on
the
threshold
or
having
their
appeal
heard
by
a
court
which
i
think
has
done
its
duty
pretty
well
and
i
think
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
record
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
which
has
disappointed
some
of
us
from
time
to
time
too,
but
the
remedies
there,
the
door
stands
open
and
they
can
have
their
judicial
remedy
there
in
virginia.
now,
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
it
does
not
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
it
does
not.
it's
concurrent
mr.
justice
goldberg
but
in
a
moment
i
will
be
there
unless
you
wish
me
to
--
to
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes,
i'll
be
there,
there's
no
doubt
of
your
power,
not
any.
now,
it
might
be
said
that
well
why
bother
by
state
court?
we
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
the
whole
thing
is
so
plain
anyway.
you
--
you
take
a
look
at
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
that
looks
like
it's
pretty
plain.
you
take
a
look
at
the
statute
and
that
looks
pretty
plain.
then
you
take
a
look
though
at
the
virginia
bill
of
rights
and
you'll
find
that
judge
mason
wrote
something
in
there
that
on
their
face
are
pretty
plain
and
on
we
go
and
we
--
i
will
not
recite
all
that's
in
our
brief
on
that
but
again
and
again
and
again,
there
are
references
here
that
have
to
be
construed
and
you
can
take
one
document
here
which
seems
perfectly
plain
and
you
can
take
another
there
that
seems
perfectly
plain
but
when
you
lay
them
side
by
side,
they
need
construction
and
they
need
construction
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
that
state
which
is
known
to
its
judiciary
better
than
anyone
else.
now,
i
may
have
mentioned
also
on
the
subject
of
how
plain
the
statute
of
one
state
may
be
to
one
who's
not
there,
i
don't
mean
to
misquote
him,
but
i
think
the
solicitor
general
only
two
days
ago
said
the
law
of
alabama
was
so
and
so.
and
i
believe
yesterday
up
here,
he
said
he
wasn't
quite
secure.
anyway,
in
his
brief
at
the
top
of
page
22,
he
said,
"there
is
no
apparent
ground
on
which
the
apportionment
could
be
held
invalid
under
the
virginia
constitution."
section
43
merely
provides
for
reapportioning
every
10
years
in
marked
contrast
to
the
constitution
of
1864
which
required
the
legislature
to
reapportion
every
10
years
on
the
basis
of
enumeration
of
population.
that's
what
he
says
in
his
brief,
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
record
on
page
65,
judge
albert
bryan
who
presided
over
the
three-judge
court
had
a
different
view
and
he
said,
"there's
little
doubt
that
in
virginia,
population
is
the
overriding
consideration
in
any
distribution
of
represent
--
to
representatives."
i
mentioned
that
the
show
that
the
thing
that
looks
so
simple
and
easy
on
its
face
sometimes
proves
not
to
be
when
we
put
all
these
things
side
by
side
then
it
is
we
must
construe.
so
we
do
not
know
what
our
court
will
say
about
section
43
of
the
constitution,
we
do
not
know.
it
has
never
been
called
on
to
comment
on
it
up
to
now.
now,
we
do
know,
however,
that
that
court
has
acted
and
it
has
not
hesitated
at
all
to
strike
down
our
constitutional
provisions
when
they
thought
they
were
invalid.
they
did
that
some
years
ago
in
the
case
of
brown
against
saunders,
i
think
it
was.
there
back
in
1932
when
that
decision
was
rendered
we
had
had
a
change
in
our
constitution
back
in
1928
and
there
was
some
malapportionment
--
it
was
thought
to
be
malapportionment
in
the
--
in
that
change
of
the
constitution.
suit
was
brought
before
the
--
the
court.
they
had
no
trouble
at
all
in
finding
that
--
that
that
was
malapportionment
and
they
required
a
election
at
large
for
the
general
--
for
the
congress
from
virginia.
and
i
say
therefore,
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
court
here
which
is
supine.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
supreme
court
that
goes
its
way,
a
certain
way
politically.
it
calls
the
shots
and
there
in
that
instance,
we
saw
by
its
action
that
it
will
take
action
if
it
feels
that
there
is
a
--
that
unconstitutional
provision.
now,
i
want
to
meet
at
this
time,
i
want
to
come
to
the
heart
of
what
i
really
want
to
say.
when
you
deal
with
the
matter
of
personal
and
individual
rights,
they
come
in
different
categories.
that’s
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
if
a
man
is
condemned
to
death
and
he
goes
to
the
court
for
redress,
that
court
can
save
his
life
and
it
must
act
now,
it's
then
and
now
and
when
it
does
that,
it's
not
laying
its
hand
on
the
machinery
of
the
government
of
the
state
in
such
a
way
as
it
changes
whole
operation,
it
is
simply
freeing
a
man.
if
somebody
is
in
prison
then
he
needs
to
be
got
out
--
he
needs
to
get
out.
it's
then
and
it's
--
its
here
and
now
as
we
so
often
say
for
him.
and
we
can
release
that
man
from
prison
without
stepping
inside
of
the
state
and
changing
its
actual
machinery
of
government.
if
the
chinese,
who
was
a
laundry
man
and
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
if
he
needs
a
license
to
do
business,
his
livelihood
depends
upon
it,
it's
--
it's
here
and
now
and
by
granting
a
man
a
license,
you
haven't
done
anything
to
change
the
machinery
of
the
government
of
a
state
and
the
habitual
criminal
who
faced
sterilization
and
sought
the
aid
of
the
court
and
received
it,
again
here
and
now.
and
we
again
did
not
lay
our
hands
on
the
machinery
of
the
state
itself
and
change
its
form,
but
another
case
came
and
i
speak
now
merely
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
in
any
sense
of
criticism
because
i
realize
the
impact
of
this,
but
a
case
came
a
few
years
ago
when
a
colored
girl
wanted
to
go
into
a
white
school
and
this
court
decided
that
that
was
her
constitutional
right.
i
say
to
you
that
education
is
also
here
and
now,
not
some
other
day,
it's
here
and
now,
but
the
impact
on
the
whole
social
structure
of
the
country
was
so
great.
this
court
did
the
only
thing
it
could
do
in
recognizing
that
impact
and
using
the
term
“all
deliberate
speed.”
there's
a
vast
difference
when
we
talk
about
human
rights.
those
that
can
be
exercised
right
away
without
making
a
profound
disturbance
and
those
that
can,
that
brings
me
to
the
order.
when
a
man
is
denied
the
suffrage
and
he
comes
to
the
court
and
say,
"they
won't
let
me
vote"
and
you
take
him
by
the
hand
of
the
door
of
the
state
and
say,
"vote
this
man,"
voting,
and
the
state
does.
and
they
count
that
vote
exactly
the
same
as
they
do
for
any
other
citizen
of
the
immediate
neighborhood,
his
own
community,
it
counts
just
the
same.
but
when
the
court
goes
not
the
door
of
the
state
leading
him
by
the
hand,
but
says,
"now,
we
want
to
know
how
you're
going
to
count
it.
none
of
you
--
none
of
you
going
to
count
it
like
the
neighbor,
we're
not
interested
in
the
neighbor.
we
have
come
in,
we
go
to
take
a
look
at
wind
of
the
state
of
the
other
and
find
out
what
you
are
doing.
we
are
going
to
deal
with
the
ratios;
we're
going
to
deal
with
the
relatives,
we're
going
to
deal
indeed
in
fractions."
now
mr.
state,
we
want
to
file
you
a
count
towards
how
you
do
it.
that's
difficult.
that's
vastly
difficult.
i
don't
say
you
cannot.
you
didn't
say
to
baker
that
you
can
and
i'm
not
here
seeking
a
review
of
baker,
i
don't.
but
i
do
say
that
you're
putting
your
hand
on
one
of
the
most
vital
things
in
government
and
we're
in
grave
danger
in
breaking
down
the
state
government
when
you
can
do
this
because
when
you
change
apportionment,
you
haven't
just
changed
that.
you
have
put
your
hand
on
the
whole
system
of
legislation
which
to
my
mind
is
the
very
heart
of
a
state
government.
that
is
what
i'm
speaking
about,
if
your
honor
please
when
i
talk
about
abstention.
it's
not
the
narrow
sense
in
which
we
normally
see
it,
but
in
the
big
sense
in
which
we
must
deal
with
it.
and
i
will
say
to
you
with
all
deference
but
with
all
sincerity,
i
will
say
to
you
that
you
have
in
your
hands
the
whip
of
baker
against
carr
--
oh
maybe
not
whip
but
you
have
that
power.
but
i
think
it
should
be
exercised
most
sparingly
and
i
think
when
you
go
to
the
door
of
that
state
and
look
in
and
find
so
many
equities
here
or
there
if
there
be
in
your
mind.
but
you
also
see
that
the
people
who
complain
have
a
remedy
within
the
state
that
they
haven't
exhausted
at
all
when
they
can
still
go
to
the
general
assembly
which
hasn't
denied
them,
“oh
we
didn't
do
it
the
way
they
wanted
last
time
but
it
has
the
denied
there
was
--
in
the
next
trial."
and
when
the
courts
are
there
available
to
them
and
they
haven't
availed
themselves
with
the
courts
then
i
say,
"this
court,
despite
all
of
its
legitimate
power
should
hold
its
own
arm
and
not
move
in
and
not
disturb
that
delicate
machinery
until
everything
had
been
done
within
the
state
that
is
possible
to
do.
this
is
not
tennessee;
this
is
a
different
deal
and
title.
i
was
privileged
to
stand
here
i
think
four
years
or
so
ago
and
argue
abstention
on
a
narrow
way
in
--
in
harrison
against
naacp.
and
the
court
went
along
with
that,
this
is
a
bigger
problem
and
the
court
there
by
the
way
did
act.
the
gentlemen
who
were
complaining
here
did
go
back.
they
brought
a
suit
in
the
lower
court,
we
had
filed
statues
involving
the
lower
court
itself
and
the
three
of
them
and
save
your
great
deal
of
your
work.
but
that
is
not
what
you're
considering,
you
don't
mind
the
way
but
i
say
to
you
--
i
say
to
you
again
that
the
only
way
that
baker
can
be
used
here
properly
in
my
view
is
to
let
it
be
known
that
the
powers
in
your
hand
and
the
power
will
be
exercised
if
you
must
but
it
will
not
be
exercised
if
the
parties
fail
unless
the
parties
fail
to
find
redress
at
home.
i'm
constrained
to
mention
one
other
thing
while
i'm
on
my
feet
because
it's
come
up
several
times
and
i
think
hasn't
been
properly
gone
into
and
that
is
the
fact
that
under
article
iv
--
section
4
of
the
federal
constitution,
we
are
guaranteed
a
republican
form
of
government
and
i
think
there's
a
misconception
as
to
what
that
is.
i
--
i
hope
i
know
the
answer.
every
revolutionary
government
on
earth
as
soon
as
it
is
in
power
puts
up
road
blocks
to
protect
itself
against
anybody
else's
revolution.
it's
always
been
so
and
in
1787
when
these
gentlemen
wrote
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
piece
of
power
was
only
four
years
old.
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
that
had
come
out
from
the
revolutionary
assemblies
and
conventions
and
from
the
bloody
battlefields
and
they
wanted
to
protect
their
gains
as
all
revolutionists
do
and
all
they
were
doing
in
guaranteeing
a
republican
form
of
government,
all
they
were
doing
was
to
be
sure
that
they
were
a
writ
of
chains
and
that
provision
did
not
only
deal
with
guaranteeing
republican
form
of
government,
but
you
will
recall
that
it
guaranteed
the
states
against
invasion
and
it
guaranteed
them
against
local
commotion
and
if
the
general
assembly
could
--
could
not
meet
then
at
the
--
at
the
call
of
the
governor,
the
united
states
would
come
in
so
that
we
are
dealing
here
--
we
--
we
--
we
shouldn't
take
that
as
a
starting
point,
i
have
to
disagree
with
or
two
of
the
arguments
out
there.
it's
not
a
grant
of
power,
it
is
stating
--
it
is
preventing
counter
revolution
and
in
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
it
has
got
a
dictionary
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
precisely
so
and
not
a
democratic
government
and
if
you
will
look
--
i
won't
take
my
colleague's
time,
if
you
will
take
a
look
at
the
madison’s
43,
you
will
find
what
he
says
there,
"that
any
form
of
republican
government
will
meet
that
requirement."
and
if
you
will
take
the
united
states
supreme
court,
the
volume
annotated
under
article
iv
--
section
4,
you
will
find
that
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
courts,
it
is
a
matter
for
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
enforce.
this
court,
not
as
a
court,
can
rise
to
the
sea
side
to
repel
attack.
this
court
cannot
as
a
court
go
into
a
state
and
establish
order
and
this
court
not
as
a
court
can
guarantee
republican
form
of
government.
i'm
taking
too
much
time
and
i
beg
your
honors.
mr.
david
j.
mays
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
pleases.
i
believe
i
have
15
minutes
which
is
lunch
time
and
if
i
find
i
have
another
segment
to
--
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
give
that
up
and
--
in
virginia's
case
with
the
luncheon
bell.
mr.
david
j.
mays
it
is.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mays
no
sir,
it
simply
says,
in
the
middle
of
page
267
that
double
asterisk,
based
on
the
1962
redistricting
acts
and
calculated
by
bureau
of
public
and
information
staff,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
i
can't
contribute
more.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes,
sir.
we've
never
had
our
state
fairly
proportioned
on
--
on
population.
mr.
david
j.
mays
well,
the
census
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
well
--
i'm
sure
that
that's
been
taken
into
consideration
but
i
can't
tell
what
goes
on
in
the
heads
of
140
members
of
that
general
assembly
and
it
may
well
be
that
many
of
them
had
taken
citizenship
as
a
test
rather
than
population.
mr.
david
j.
mays
our
difficulty
is
getting
in
the
back
of
the
skulls
of
all
these
people
as
to
what
influenced
them
and
we
don't
know.
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mays
i
can't
--
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
inform
you
more.
of
course
we'd
take
into
consideration
geography
and
many
other
factors
but
i
realized
what
you
getting
--
getting
at.
mr.
david
j.
mays
it's
--
it's
on
the
basis
of
inclusion
of
military
of
sorts,
i
know.
it
was
the
outside
figure
on
population.
now
if
i
may
take
a
moment
or
two
further
on
abstention,
i
--
i
brought
that
to
--
to
your
honors'
attention
in
two
aspects,
one,
a
rather
narrow
one
and
one,
a
much
broader.
the
narrow
one
was
that
you
can
take
virginia
constitution
which
may
seem
perfectly
plain
and
you
make
take
the
sections
24
in
which
seem
perfectly
plain
but
you
have
to
lay
them
beside
other
things
in
the
constitution
too.
now,
in
saving
time,
i
made
a
general
reference
to
our
brief
but
i
call
your
attentions
specifically
now
to
two
provisions
of
our
constitution.
when
george
mason
wrote
it
and
has
been
copied
all
over
the
world
and
the
bill
of
rights
of
our
constitution
became
the
first
10
amendments
in
different
language
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
we
ratified
it.
we
didn't
want
to
lose
the
union.
we
ratified
it
in
order
to
have
a
union
but
we
have
gentlemen's
agreement
to
put
the
amendments
in
as
the
first
10
amendments
of
the
constitution.
that
was
agreed
by
both
sides.
and
mason
said,
"that
all
men
are
by
nature
equally
free
and
independent
and
have
certain
inherent
rights."
what
does
that
mean
when
we
put
it
beside
section
43?
i
don't
know
what
our
court
would
say.
again,
section
63,
subsection
18
of
our
constitution
provides
and,
"the
general
assembly
shall
not
enact
any
local
special
or
private
law
granting
to
any
individual
any
special
right,
privilege
or
immunity."
how
will
they
construe
that
against
43?
i
don't
know
and
i
say
that
should
be
given
a
chance.
but
it
was
beyond
that
that
i
went
in
saying
that
--
that
here,
we
have
a
peculiar
case
for
abstention
because
at
this
instance,
we
are
not
simply
giving
a
right
to
an
individual
or
rather
not
giving
a
right
but
we
are
--
we
are
seeing
that
he
gets
it.
but
we
are
going
inside
of
the
state
and
changing
its
very
machinery
of
government
in
order
to
accomplish
a
result
and
i
say
therefore,
that
we
--
when
we
apply
baker
to
that
state
of
facts,
we
have
to
do
it
with
the
greatest
caution.
now
i
know
that
mcneese
has
been
cited
here
and
when
i
first
saw
it,
i
was
troubled
by
it
but
when
i
analyzed
it,
i
wasn't.
mcnesse
was
a
case
in
which
you
had
an
integration
situation
in
illinois
of
all
places
and
not
the
south.
and
you
had
waited
nine
years
to
get
that
thing
of
a
(inaudible)
and
you
still
haven't
done
it
in
the
north.
and
you
went
after
them.
i
have
no
(inaudible)
about
that.
what
i'm
talking
about
here
is,
we
have
a
case
of
first
impression
dealing
with
the
voting
situation
in
which
you
are
laying
your
hand
on
the
internal
machinery
of
government
and
i
think
there,
the
court
should
show
restraint
when
it
comes
to
a
state
like
virginia
which
has
come
close,
not
perfect
and
i
appreciated
mr.
justice
goldberg's
observation,
"why
aren't
you
perfect
virginia?"
you
didn't
ask
that
question
of
anybody
else
and
i
was
very
flattered
that
he
had
asked
it
at
all.
so
i
think
it
mcneese
here
is
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
well,
i
think
you
get
it
sir
but
of
course
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
democracy,
we're
dealing
with
the
republic
and
they
are
two
different
things.
so
much
of
that,
if
i
--
i
may,
i
--
before
i
leave
that
observation
the
attorney
general
though,
i
--
i
want
to
point
and
i
don't
think
it
unfair
to
him
for
me
to
do
that
his
views
on
that
had
been
very
interesting
during
the
course
of
this
summer.
i
think
it's
not
improper
to
make
this
reference.
on
july
the
first,
he
appeared
in
seattle
before
the
attorneys
general
and
all
the
attorneys
general
present
familiar
with
the
language
he
had
used
and
i
quote
it
now.
he
had
just
said,
"that
in
the
view
of
the
purest,
in
the
purest
view,
it
ought
to
be
one
vote
for
one
--
one
man,
one
vote",
but
there
he
said,
and
i
quote
exactly."
nevertheless
there
is
much
to
be
said
against
the
purest
view.
it
seems
wholly
inconsistent
with
our
history
and
practice
is
almost
in
so
founding
of
the
colonies."
it
would
assert
that
well
over
half
the
states
have
been
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
continuously
since
its
enactment.
it
would
require
the
total
reconstitution
of
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
state
legislatures.
it
would
leave
no
room
for
local
autonomy
and
matters
of
representation.
perhaps
--
perhaps,
i
shall
later
find
myself
arguing
for
the
principle
but
time
was
(inaudible)
that
at
least
today,
i
wonder
whether
in
the
face
of
his
considerations
--
mr.
david
j.
mays
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
j.
mays
yes
sir,
but
they
will
make
them
and
to
use
them,
cleared
before
they
make
them
too.
at
least
today,
i
wonder
whether
in
the
face
of
these
considerations,
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
fairly
be
held
to
lay
down
so
rigid
a
rule.
and
again,
we
will
say
we
couldn't
agree
with
him
more
than
when
he
made
that
particular
observation.
and
i
recall
too
that
he
said
on
page
44
of
the
brief
in
alabama
case,
"any
reapportionment
honored
by
a
court
is
a
poor
substitute
for
one
of
the
people's
own
making."
now,
what
the
solicitor
general,
i
don't
need
to
bow
down
on
him
entirely
i'll
get
to
the
others
if
i
have
time
but
the
solicitor
general
here
has
held
that,
in
the
maryland
brief.
he
has
held
out
to
you
that
there
should
be
one
man
one
vote.
he
said
that's
the
general
principle
to
keep
in
mind
but
what
he
says
to
you
after
that
is
your
honors.
one
man,
one
vote
is
really
the
real
thing,
that's
the
principle.
i
don't
ask
you
to
--
to
enunciate
it,
no
--
no,
don't
leave
them.
just
keep
it
in
the
back
oh
your
head
some
place
and
keeping
it
there,
declare
all
of
these
states
violative
of
the
federal
constitution.
what
he
is
suggesting
to
you
is
that
you
have
in
the
back
of
your
heads
a
system
of
rules.
he
has
named
one,
this
is
one.
and
that
you
would
just
keep
them
in
mind
and
knock
these
states
out
without
having
any
guidelines
set
forth
to
all
of
them.
that's
exactly
what
it
amounts
to
in
the
simplest
kind
of
lay
english.
there
of
course,
he
couldn't
ask
it
to
having
a
fixed
rule.
no
political
side
has
--
can
say
25%
is
right,
why
not
26,
why
not
30,
why
not
18,
why
not
16
and
two-thirds?
you
can't
do
it
like
that
and
if
this
court,
may
i
say,
if
this
court
would
attempt
it
and
say
"we
will
allow
this
much
permissibility."
it
would
not
be
a
judicial
function,
it
will
be
a
legislative
function
and
assume
as
you
do
that
to
the
extent
that
you
do
it,
you
are
denying
republican
government
the
form
of
government
under
article
iv,
section
4
of
the
constitution,
the
very
thing
that
we
assured
we
must
have
and
you
can't
legislate.
i
have
so
little
time
for
the
rest
but
i
must
hit
a
few
things.
mr.
jefferson
is
true
with
all
the
soldiers
that
we
are
now
but
all
the
soldiers
in
jefferson's
day
in
virginia
were
virginia
soldiers
called
from
the
(inaudible)
in
connecticut
when
there
was
talks
in
the
sound
of
a
revolution
and
they
all
went
back
to
the
(inaudible)
to
harvest
the
crops.
we
didn't
have
any
outsiders
so
the
company
of
a
100
north
carolinians
came
in,
in
the
french
and
indian
wall
and
we
didn't
see
any
others
until
the
eve
of
(inaudible).
well,
we
are
talking
here
about
an
entirely
different
thing
when
we
speak
of
enormous
numbers
of
very
fine
young
men
who
come
into
our
community
for
limited
time
and
go.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
how
many
registered
but
it
is
notorious
in
our
state
that
very
few
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
had
a
situation
in
it
too
in
the
history
of
this
country
where
a
man
never
did
vote
until
he
was
running
for
the
president
itself.
now,
i
was
--
a
question
was
asked,
"what
about
shenandoah
county?"
i
don't
know
whether
that
question
was
rhetorical
or
not.
it
has
a
small
vote.
why
so
small?
now,
just
to
point
out
to
you
that
virginia
is
not
gerrymandering,
shenandoah
county
has
a
republican
there
who
comes
to
our
general
assembly
or
regularly
in
votes
to
republican
view
and
we
have
not
attempted
to
gerrymander
him
out
of
his
representation.
and
if
you
look
below
richmond
of
the
county
of
chesterfield,
you
will
find
that
that
is
probably
has
--
has
much
malapportionment
as
any
and
that's
a
good
loyal
democratic
county
and
we
haven't
tried
to
do
anything
especially
for
them.
and
we
of
course
have
a
--
a
democratic
state.
now,
reference
was
made
to
the
richmond
situation
and
we
say
you
got
eight
representatives
here
for
richmond
and
--
and
chesapeake
and
henrico
county
which
surrounds
it
in
one
voter.
the
reason
for
that
is
simply
this.
you
see,
you
can't
sit
here
and
not
know
50
states
thoroughly
and
pass
on
this,
you
can't.
in
richmond
and
henrico
county,
we
are
now
in
the
process
we
hope
of
annexing
a
good
part
of
henrico
county
to
the
city
of
richmond.
and
the
general
assembly
which
made
that
possible
--
which
made
that
possible
anticipated
this
by
setting
up
the
new
representation
to
that
fashion
and
that
same
general
assembly
found
--
that
same
general
assembly
found
that
there
was
underrepresentation
in
the
counties
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
and
it
is
overlooked.
that
1962
--
has
overlooked
it
at
1962,
virginia
gave
fairfax
a
new
senator
and
it
gave
fairfax
a
new
delegate.
so
the
argument
that
these
people
would
never
give
any
of
their
power
vanishes
in
the
light
of
what
they
actually
did.
we
did
in
apportion
--
gave
both
of
them
more
representation
in
both
house.
now,
it
maybe
from
the
map,
some
may
say
that
the
crazy
quilt
--
sorry
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
