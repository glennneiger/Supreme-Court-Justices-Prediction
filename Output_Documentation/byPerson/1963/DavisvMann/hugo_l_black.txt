would
you
mind
interpreting
that
to
me?
just
what
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
of
initiating
diffusion
of
political,
what
would
you
understand
that
to
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
it
can
legislate
so
as
to
give
the
votes
in
the
rural
section
more
effect
than
the
votes
in
the
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
is
that
what
it
means
in
the
past?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
give
them
more
weight.
you
let
them
vote
count
for
more
in
the
election
of
representatives
and
no
one
in
the
city.
justice

black
i'm
not
sure
that
i
--
may
i
--
may
i
--
just
see
if
it
can
get
it
clear
because
i
appreciate
your
argument,
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
you,
but
do
you
mean
by
that
that
if
you
have
a
county,
a
rural
county,
where
there
are
50,000
voters,
have
another
city
county
where
there's
500,000
voters
that
the
legislature
is
free
without
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
to
take
such
steps
and
pass
the
apportionment
legislation
that
it
will
give
the
rural
people
because
they
are
rural
and
diffused,
one
representative
for
each
50,000
and
the
other
in
the
city
district,
one
representative
to
every
500,000,
is
that
what
you
mean?
i
don't
mean
to
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
(voice

--
in
principle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
consider
that
the
rural
voters
can
have
more
representatives
per
person
or
per
persons
than
those
in
the
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
there's
some
history
for
that
view
in
virginia.

allowing

in

justice

mr.
campbell
may
i
ask
you
a
--
something
about
your
table
along
page
5
and
6
of
your
brief.
one
alleged
to
the
--
illustrates
to
what
you
considered
the
most
(inaudible)
inequities
of
the
1962
act
with
reference
to
the
house
and
one
with
reference
to
the
senate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
from
those
that
the
chief
inequities
as
you
see
them
are
--
have
been
in
--
inflicted
on
arlington,
fairfax
and
norfolk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
taking
page
5,
there
is
nothing
except
that
arlington,
fairfax
and
norfolk
and
the
counties
they
are
under
stated,
they
range
--
those
counties
range
a
population
for
delegate
some
21,000
to
29,000.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
forgetting
--
leaving
out
arlington,
fairfax
and
norfolk.
suppose
that
arlington,
fairfax
and
norfolk
has
been
given
population
for
delegate
of
something
like
25,000
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
each
25,000
people,
what
would
you
say
about
your
figures
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
looking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
looking
at
your
--
at
your
figures
on
page
5,
and
that
10
counties
there
i
presume
have
only
one
delegate
and
that's
because
their
population
ranges
from
21,000
to
29,000.
suppose
those
were
the
only
nine,
the
point
i'm
asking
you
is
this,
would
you
think
that
in
order
to
give
one
representative
to
each
county
rather
than
split
them
up
that
you
would
challenge
that
as
a
fair
allocation
according
to
proportion
if
he
--
if
those
were
the
only
counties
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
arguing
as
i
understand
it
that
there
is
a
(inaudible)
for
precise
equality
in
connection
with
counties
that
range
along
the
lines
that
we
have
mentioned
on
page
5.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
you
would
say
that
was
perfectly
a
legitimate
thing
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
designed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
reason
given
by
the
--
this
great
discrepancy
among
the
number
of
people
to
have
representatives
in
arlington,
fair
--
in
fairfax
county
and
these
other
little
counties,
what's
the
reason
given
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
reason
has
been
given
here
in
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
people
who
are
just
temporarily
located
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
reason
can
you
suggest
as
to
why
that
was
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
the
counties
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
observed
in
the
represented
bodies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
these
military
people
pay
taxes,
do
they
pay
the
state
income
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
--
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
had
a
100,000
military
people
and
you
took
them
all
out?
take
that
away
from
the
total
population
of
norfolk
and
what
would
be
the
population
percentage
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
100,000,
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
--
how
do
that
compare
with
these
other
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
not
accepted
as
a
valid
rational
ground,
what
other
ground
as
suggested
for
the
discrepancy
of
the
figure
to
any
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
--
suppose
however,
that
should
not
be
accepted
as
a
valid
ground
for
doing
it,
rational
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
other
grounds
have
been
suggested
to
justify
this
discrepancy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
do
you
point
to
is
the
reason
why
this
discrepancy
was
put
in
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
record?
does
the
record
show
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
could
be
inferred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
of
the
--
the
crazy
quilt
has
been
used
a
lot
but
what
--
in
what
sense
do
you
mean
use
it
in
what
you
are
saying
practically
speaking?
what
sense
do
you
use
it
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it's
a
crazy
quilt,
in
what
sense
do
you
sense
that
then?
