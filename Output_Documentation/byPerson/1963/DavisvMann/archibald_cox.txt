mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
in
this
virginia
case
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
i
want
to
devote
myself
very
briefly
if
i
can
to
two
or
three
of
the
points
that
have
been
raised
with
particular
reference
to
this
case.
first,
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
question
of
abstention.
this
is
the
only
case
in
which
it
has
been
argued
and
indeed
the
only
case
in
which
it
could
be
argued
that
--
equitable
doctrine
of
abstention
applies
and
that
the
court
below
should
not
have
preceded
to
an
adjudication
of
merits.
it
could
not
have
been
argued
in
the
other
cases,
in
the
maryland
case
because
it
was
in
the
state
court,
the
best
reason
of
all.
in
the
new
york
case
because
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
could
be
any
remedy
under
new
york
law
for
a
violation
of
new
york's
constitution
because
it
was
new
york's
constitution
that
was
involved
and
in
the
alabama
case,
it
could
not
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there
could
have
been
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
and
i
--
i
suppose
--
used
unfortunate
words.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
there
could
have
been.
now,
the
plaintiffs
could
have
had
no
recourse
to
a
cause
of
action
founded
upon
state
law
to
secure
the
kind
of
redress
that
they
were
seeking.
i
think
that's
really
what
i
meant
when
i
said
there
was
no
state
remedy.
in
the
alabama
case,
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
apparently
held
on
several
occasions
that
it
could
do
nothing
about
this
and
therefore,
there
was
no
chance
of
obtaining
a
remedy
in
the
alabama
courts.
also
that
case
that
perhaps
above
all,
in
view
of
the
issues
raised
about
the
interpretation
of
the
alabama
constitution
would
be
one
where
the
argument
might
have
been
appropriate
whereas
not
for
those
persons.
we
submit
that
in
this
instance,
the
district
court
was
plainly
right
in
adjudicating
the
case
of
the
merits
because
no
ground
of
abstention
that
was
made
out.
as
we
read
the
cases,
there
are
two
grounds
on
which
a
federal
court
of
equity
may
properly
abstain
from
passing
upon
a
claim
raised
under
the
federal
constitution
or
under
other
federal
law.
the
first
is
where
a
question
involving
the
construction
of
the
state
law
is
bound
up
with
or
perhaps
antecedent
to
the
federal
question.
in
such
a
case
of
course,
for
the
federal
court
to
go
ahead,
it
may
be
deciding
a
hypothetical
case
because
it
may
adopt
the
construction
of
the
state
law
that
that
state
courts
will
not
adopt.
it
maybe
deciding
a
constitutional
question
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
decide
if
the
state
court
can
speak
first
and
for
both
reasons,
this
court
has
held
and
the
lower
courts
followed
the
view
that
they
should
abstain
unless
some
reason
of
contrary
appears.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
principle
but
no
such
question
is
involved
here.
the
state
law
under
which
the
election
officials
would
proceed
unless
enjoined
is
perfectly
clear,
there
is
no
dispute
about
its
meaning.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
any
provision
of
the
virginia
constitution
because
there
is
none
that
bears
even
arguably
upon
this
question.
and
consequently,
but
one
word
more,
the
reference
in
judge
bryan's
opinion
where
he
says
that
in
virginia,
population
is
undoubtedly
debased
is
not
a
reference
to
any
requirement
of
the
virginia
constitution.
it's
a
reference
to
what
in
fact
has
undoubtedly
happened
over
the
year.
and
there
again,
everything
he
said
seems
to
me
consistent
with
the
view
that
i've
expressed.
there
is
no
antecedent
question
of
state
law
involved.
now
the
second
ground
on
which
this
court
has
held
to
the
lower
court
and
this
court
might
abstain
from
deciding
a
federal
question,
a
federal
constitutional
question,
is
that
there
is
a
state
remedy
based
upon
state
law
which
makes
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
federal
constitutional
question.
we've
suggested
in
our
brief
that
that
doctrine
is
not
applicable
where
the
suit
is
founded
upon
the
civil
rights
act.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
decisions
in
the
monroe
and
pape
and
in
the
mcneese
case
sustained
that
proposition
and
with
it,
we
would
argue
that
they
were
right,
that
the
aim
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
to
give
one
who
alleged
the
deprivation
of
federal
constitutional
rights
a
--
and
a
remedy
in
the
federal
court
because
it
was
believed
that
the
federal
remedy
would
be
more
effective
or
at
least
might
be
more
effective
than
some
alternative
state
remedy
even
though
very
possibly
they're
based
upon
the
state
law
but
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here.
here
there
is
no
suggestion
that
there
is
any
remedy
based
upon
the
state
constitution
but
no
one
has
suggested
any
provision
of
the
state
constitution
that
this
apportionment
violates
but
not
even
by
the
wildest
stretch
of
the
imagination.
any
remedy
that
exists
is
a
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
and
certainly
there
is
no
occasion
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
a
federal
court
should
defer
to
a
state
court
in
enforcing
a
--
if
in
a
suit
to
enforce
a
federal
constitutional
right.
the
plea
for
abstention
let
this
go
to
the
state
legislature,
let's
see
what
the
state
courts
will
do.
it
seems
to
me
simply
a
plea
that
the
federal
court
not
adjudicate
whether
the
plaintiff's
have
constitutional
rights.
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
or
any
consideration
that
would
support
that
position.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
just
can't
--
i
just
can't
find
anything
in
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
would
lead
one
to
--
to
think
that
was
a
possibility
if
the
--
in
the
case
i
think
would
be
quite
different
if
there
were
something
there
that
made
at
least
a
--
a
substantial
possibility.
but
we've
seen
nothing
there
and
we
see
nothing
suggested
by
any
of
the
parties
that
would
sustain
that
view.
coming
now
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
sir
there's
nothing
in
the
state
constitution.
of
course
it
found
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
coming
--
coming
now
to
the
merits.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
i
--
i
just
don't
--
i
just
don't
see
the
foundation
for
it
in
the
language.
all
the
language
says
is
that
there
shall
be
periodic
reapportionment.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
was
an
exceedingly
free
construction
of
the
language.
and
also
one
which
while
it
has
been
based
in
many
apportionments
in
virginia,
certainly
it
is
something
that
over
the
years
has
not
been
done
with
any
effort
in
equal
population.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
seems
to
me
that
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
--
there
is
none
in
the
virginia
constitution.
i
--
it
does
have
a
more
specific
meaning
as
applied
here
and
as
applied
to
the
distinctions
that
some
of
these
apportionments
have
tried
to
make
between
people
then
a
constitution
that
has
no
substantive
guarantees
that
are
applicable
to
these
problem
at
all.
coming
to
the
merits,
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
the
nature
of
the
claim
made
here
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
claim
is
not
so
loose
as
that
virginia
has
an
unrepresentative
legislature.
it's
a
claim
that
there
is
discrimination
against
three
specific
areas,
a
city,
a
county
on
the
city
and
the
county
that
is
either
capricious
in
the
sense
that
those
areas
have
been
discriminated
against
for
no
reason
whatever
or
that
its
invidious
in
the
sense
that
they
have
been
singled
out
for
adverse
treatment
because
something
in
the
character
of
their
population.
there
is
no
question
i
take
it
on
the
facts
that
there
is
this
kind
of
discrimination
against
arlington,
norfolk
and
fairfax.
to
mention
just
one
figure,
fairfax
has
only
three
delegates
in
the
virginia
house
of
representative
of
where
on
any
population
base,
it
would
be
entitled
to
seven,
more
than
twice
as
many
and
in
the
senate
too
which
underrepresented,
it
has
only
two
but
it
would
be
entitled
to
three.
and
while
i
think
the
most
extreme
case,
it's
equally
clear
that
there
is
this
kind
of
discrimination
against
arlington
and
the
city
of
norfolk.
now
i
stress
that
this
is
a
capricious
or
invidious
discrimination
against
the
people
of
those
specific
areas
because
that,
it
seems
to
me
is
the
answer
to
counsel's
argument
that
virginia's
legislature
on
the
whole
is
pretty
representative
much
more
so
than
in
many
state.
where
the
claim
is
that
there
is
capricious
or
invidious
discrimination
against
a
substantial
group
of
people
then
it's
no
answer
to
say,
"well,
we
come
out
pretty
well
in
terms
of
the
number
of
--
in
terms
of
the
population
base
required
to
elect
the
minimum
number
of
the
majority
of
the
legislature."
in
this
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
campbell
was
absolutely
right.
one
can
illustrate
the
point,
and
i
think
so
that
it's
clear
beyond
dispute
by
a
very
simple
example.
suppose
if
one
can
--
imagines
a
state
of
a
150,000
people
with
15
counties,
all
of
which
are
equal
again
in
every
respect.
10
of
them
have
two
representative
districts,
i'm
imagining
a
unicameral
legislature
with
5000
people
in
each
and
five
have
only
one
district
with
10,000
people
in
it,
the
whole
county.
so
that
those
people
have
half
the
representation
on
per
capita
basis
of
the
other
counties
unless
my
arithmetic
is
badly
wrong,
it
would
take
representatives
elected
by
half
the
people
of
my
imaginary
county,
exactly
half,
to
constitute
a
majority
in
my
imagine
--
unicameral
legislature
if
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
--
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
people
of
the
five
counties.
and
so
here,
the
fact
that
it
takes
about
40%
in
each
house
of
the
virginia
--
of
the
population
of
virginia
to
elect
the
majority
in
each
house
seems
to
me
to
be
irrelevant.
that
put
this
in
the
general
terms
and
in
terms
of
the
basic
propositions
that
i've
argued
to
the
court
in
these
cases.
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
how
high
or
low
a
state
ranks
on
the
list
of
the
smallest
major
--
smallest
percentage
of
the
population
needed
to
elect
the
majority
of
the
legislature
so
long
as
one
is
talking
in
terms
of
either
by
our
second
or
a
third
proposition.
that
is
to
say
when
you're
talking
about
a
capricious
discrimination
or
an
invidious
discrimination,
one
not
directed
at
a
permissible
legislative
purpose
in
terms
of
apportionment.
then
i
think
that
it's
immaterial
of
what
is
the
balance
of
power
in
a
state
legislature
of
those
people
are
being
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
when
one
comes
to
our
fourth
proposition
and
says
that
the
inequalities
are
so
gross
and
the
sub
--
submerging
of
principle
of
majority
rule
or
popular
will
is
so
great
that
even
though
the
legislature
--
that
even
though
the
law
has
a
permissible
function
and
unreasonable
balance
has
been
strung,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
considerations
such
as
this
do
come
into
play
because
in
determining
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law,
our
proposition
refers
one
to
the
overall
situation.
i
would
say
the
same
thing
is
true
and
this
is
one
reason
i
mentioned
it,
about
such
considerations
as
whether
there
is
--
that
constitution
may
be
changed
by
initiative
and
referendum
or
whether
it
was
recently
adopted
by
popular
vote.
if
the
basic
proposition
to
which
one
refers,
to
determine
whether
there's
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
in
terms
of
the
degree
that
there's
a
permissible
purpose
but
an
impermissible
balance
has
been
strung
but
then
i
think
those
factors
may
come
into
operation
but
not
in
terms,
as
i
say
of
our
second
and
third
proposition.
then
may
i
address
myself
very
briefly
in
the
two
or
three
minutes
remaining
to
macdougall
against
green.
in
macdougall
and
green,
the
court
said,
and
half
way
out,
misplaced
the
brief
i
was
--
here
it
is."
that
a
state
may
assure
to
measure
it
--
to
assure
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
initiative
as
between
its
thinly
populated
counties
and
those
county
having
concentrated
masses
that
this
was
something
permissible
for
the
state
to
do."
i
would
emphasize
here
something
which
i
think
has
been
overlooked.
macdougall
and
green
was
talking
about
how
you
nominate
candidates
for
a
statewide
office
by
a
petition,
nominating
petition
and
the
language
that
is
so
often
quoted
speaks
in
terms
of
assuring
a
diffusion
of
political
initiative.
i
take
it,
it
was
talking
the
business
of
getting
signatures
on
a
nominating
petition
and
what
was
said
that
is
that
you
may
require
signatures
from
all
around
the
state
and
not
just
from
cook
county.
well,
if
you're
talking
about
candidates
for
statewide
office,
that
is
a
--
it's
--
and
you're
talking
about
people
not
running
from
one
of
the
recognized
parties
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
ballot
isn't
just
being
clattered
up
by
a
lot
of
very
popular
local,
people
who
were
popular
locally.
it
would
be
calculated
to
assure
fairness
in
the
election
to
see
that
there
were
some
strength
all
through
the
state.
and
i
think
that
that
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence,
the
court
referred
to
the
practical
opportunities
for
exerting
their
political
weight
which
it
possessed
by
people
in
the
cities.
that's
much
easier
to
collect
signatures
in
the
city
than
it
is
to
collect
signatures
out
in
the
rural
areas
just
because
that
more
people
there
and
there
closer
together.
i
cannot
believe
that
macdougall
and
green
was
meant
to
say
or
that
it
does
say
that
it
is
proper
to
weigh
the
importance
to
be
given
in
the
votes,
the
votes
of
one
area
against
the
importance
to
be
given
the
votes
in
some
other
areas.
certainly,
no
such
question
was
before
the
court.
certainly,
the
reference
to
political
initiative
is
not
appropriate
for
that
purpose
and
i
would
say
as
i
argued
last
week
that
certainly
to
this
extent,
the
decision
--
the
argument
is
contrary
to
gray
and
sanders
that
i
think
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
confess,
i
hadn't
thought
of
the
point
but
i'm
glad
to
it
a
thousand.
i
do
think
that
what
may
be
comparable
to
the
thought
in
macdougall
and
green
is
the
suggestion
that
i
made
last
week
that
there
might
be
some
purposes
which
were
relevant
to
apportionment
like
the
desire
to
have
somebody
from
each
separate
reason
--
region
of
the
state
that
it
--
that
that
is
the
meaning
that
macdougall
and
green
may
be
given
here.
one
final
point,
very
briefly,
with
respect
to
the
military
population
or
military-related
population
in
the
counties.
without
going
into
the
figures
or
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
very
well
presented,
i
simply
want
to
emphasize
that
the
contention
that
we
stressed
the
most
and
i
think
the
appellees
do
too,
is
that
these
figures
about
military
related
population
simply
will
not
explain
the
inequalities
of
the
discrimination
against
these
three
areas.
