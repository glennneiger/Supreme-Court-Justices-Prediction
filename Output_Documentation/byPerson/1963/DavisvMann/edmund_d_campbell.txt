mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
complaint
of
virginia
citizens
against
invidious
discrimination
now
before
this
court
is
--
is
not
a
new
one
for
the
state.
thomas
jefferson
in
1781,
in
his
notes
on
virginia,
federally
complained
about
the
apportionment
of
the
legislature.
even
at
that
time
he
said,
"the
county
of
warwick
with
only
100
fighting
men
has
an
equal
representation
with
the
county
of
lawton
which
has
1746."
and
then
he
said,
"it
will
appear
that
19,000
men
living
below
the
falls
of
the
river
that
is
in
tidewater
possessed
eighth
of
the
senate
and
want
four
members
only
of
possessing
the
majority
of
the
house
of
delegates."
this
19,000
therefore,
living
in
one
part
of
the
country
give
a
lot
of
up
rates
of
30,000
living
in
another.
mr.
jefferson
didn't
like
malapportionment.
he
didn't
also
--
he
also
did
not
like
the
exclusion
of
fighting
men.
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
--
at
this
point
to
rush
in
where
the
solicitor
general
has
--
has
feared
to
thread.
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
accept
four
propositions
which
i
believe
will
be
of
great
assistance
to
the
district
courts
in
solving
this
--
not
a
problem,
this
political
thicket
that
--
it
does
now
exist
and
which
i
believe
this
court
might
properly
accept.
the
first
preposition
is
one
which
i
believe
the
court
has
already
accepted
and
that
is
that
a
citizen's
right
to
be
protected
from
arbitrary
or
capricious
debasement
of
his
votes,
a
vote
is
one
which
is
secured
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whether
it's
implicit
or
explicit
in
baker
or
--
and
in
gray
against
sanders,
i
--
i
believe
it
is
a
--
a
ruling
of
the
court.
the
second
proposition
that
i
wish
to
--
to
make
and
this
one
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
obviously
explicit
mister
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
was
--
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
--
i
assert
and
this
is
a
--
this
will
be
a
--
a
definite
statement
that
i
ask
this
court
to
take
that
the
equal
protection
means
the
equal
weighting
of
votes
in
legislative
representation
unless
modified
by
a
valid
legislative
classification.
that
is
that
we
must
start
with
the
proposition
which
mr.
jefferson
again
stated
in
a
letter
to
general
william
king,
the
first
governor
of
maine
in
1819
on
the
occasion
of
the
admission
of
maine
to
the
union,
that
equal
representation
is
so
fundamental
a
principle
in
a
two
republic
that
no
prejudice
can
justify
its
violation
because
it
prejudices
themselves
cannot
be
justified.
i
--
i
would
ask
the
court
to
--
to
adopt
the
principle
set
forth
in
this
magnificent
classic
brief
of
mr.
john
mcconnell
filed
in
alabama
on
a
subject
of
the
fundamental
principle
of
equal
representation
in
a
republic.
it
is
--
it's
an
outstanding
document,
i
never
saw
it
and
never
met
mr.
mcconnell
until
we
came
to
this
--
this
court
but
it
is
--
is
well
worth
the
--
the
careful
consideration
of
the
court.
in
a
principal
here
that
in
a
democracy,
affirmative
government
must
be
government
by
all
majority,
that
the
minority
is
protected
by
the
--
by
the
bill
of
rights
and
by
such
other
restrictions
as
the
court
may
impose
but
that
if
you
haven't
and
this
is
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
of
the
other
day,
if
you
have
a
choice
between
tyranny
by
a
majority
and
tyranny
by
a
minority,
we
must
always
take
tyranny
by
a
majority
because
the
minority
has
in
its
power
at
any
moment
the
power
to
overthrow
the
majority
and
become
itself
a
majority,
and
if
the
protections
of
the
minority
are
protections
not
in
the
range
of
affirmative
government.
we
should
not
give
minorities
in
either
house
affirmative
government.
we
should
give
them
the
protections
--
restrictions
against
abuse
by
a
majority.
i
--
i
submit
that
that
is
a
--
a
--
a
fundamental
principle
that
if
--
that
fundamentally,
government
must
function
and
that
government
may
properly
function
only
by
a
majority
vote.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
certainly
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
think
that
if
you
give
for
example
the
voters
in
one
house
of
a
bicameral
legislature,
give
the
minority
what
--
regardless
of
what
minority
it
may
be,
the
right
to
exercise
affirmative
government
by
classifying
it
other
than
on
the
basis
of
population,
you
have
destroyed
to
that
extent
the
republic
and
i'll
give
your
--
give
your
honor
a
specific
example.
if
we
prefer
the
thinly
populated
areas
as
mr.
mcilwaine
has
suggested
that
virginia
has
done
but
which
i
will
show
to
your
honors
it
has
not
done.
if
we
prefer
the
thinly
populated
areas,
we
are
giving
a
preference
to
voters
in
a
pastoral
community
one
way,
one
reason
or
another.
we
are
--
if
we
prefer
--
if
we
make
a
property
qualification,
we
are
giving
a
--
an
--
additional,
i
mean
a
--
a
separate
kind
of
classification
whatever
kind
of
minority
you
choose
for
this
--
of
a
house
if
it
be
--
if
one
house
be
on
population
and
the
other
one
be
on
some
other
basis.
what
other
--
whatever
kind
of
minority
you
choose,
you
are
choosing
it
on
the
basis
of
sex,
on
the
basis
of
property,
on
the
basis
of
wealth,
on
the
basis
of
occupation,
on
the
basis
of
residents,
on
the
basis
of
place
of
business
or
some
other
kind
of
--
of
--
of
basis.
but
whatever
basis
that
is,
it
--
it
gives
to
minority
a
special
class
of
minority
and
affirmative
government
right
in
its
minority
should
not
have,
i
submit
that
affirmative
government
right
but
only
a
check
upon
the
majority.
now,
if
i
am
correct
in
that
principle
and
--
and
i
submit
that
this
is
fundamental
in
a
republic
and
mr.
jefferson
again
said
it
was
fundamental
in
a
republic
and
to
the
extent
that
a
government
departed
from
it
in
any
frame
--
in
any
phase
of
its
--
of
its
operations
to
that
extent,
it
is
no
longer
a
true
republic
and
my
colleague
mr.
howell
has
cited
that
in
his
brief.
the
third
proposition
is
that
the
right
of
undiluted
political
franchise
is
a
transcendent
right
using
a
footnote,
they
were
the
language
in
a
footnote
in
gray
against
sanders
somewhat
akin
to
the
right
of
free
speech.somewhat
akin
to
the
right
of
citizen
to
be
secure
against
physical
mutilation
as
in
the
skinner
against
oklahoma
case.
and
if
we
once
proved
or
if
--
if
there
is
a
substantial
variation
from
equality
in
population
then
the
burden,
contrary
to
the
usual
situation
in
classifications
then
the
burden
shifts
upon
the
state
to
show
a
rational
basis
for
that
classification.
i
--
i
urge
this
court
to
adopt
that
--
that
proposition
that
the
right
of
political
franchise
is
a
--
in
a
sense
a
transcendent
right
closely
akin
to
the
right
of
free
speech
and
that
if
we
depart
from
equality
of
population
and
representation
then
the
burden
is
upon
those
who
assert
the
rationality
of
it
to
give
a
rational
basis
and
the
reason
for
that
your
honors
is
this.
they
are
--
they
are
cases
as
your
honors
know
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
country
on
this
proposition.
the
minimum
standards
which
this
court
lays
down
for
reapportionment
are
up
to
be
the
maximum
standards
followed
by
the
states
who
are
requested
or
required
to
make
reapportionment.
it
is
--
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
--
that
this
court
lay
down
a
standard
and
i
trust
it
would
of
equal
population
with
a
burden
upon
this
state
to
show
a
rational
basis
for
a
departure.
judge
bryan
in
his
masterful
opinion
in
the
district
court
said,
"plaintiffs
have
proved
the
inequity
of
the
allotment
of
representatives
on
the
basis
of
population.
they
are
upon
the
burden
to
adduce
evidence
of
the
presence
of
other
factors
which
might
explain
this
disproportion
passed
to
the
defendants.
i
--
i
submit
that
is
a
--
that
is
an
appropriate
position
for
the
court
to
take.
and
lastly,
the
fourth
proposition
i
ask
this
court
to
accept
is
that
a
legislative
classification
must
be
rational.
if
there
be
any
classification
against
the
--
the
equal
population
factor,
it
must
be
rational,
it
must
be
based
on
--
it
must
not
be
designed
to
favor
any
group
of
persons
by
a
reason
of
their
residence,
their
occupation,
their
color,
their
sex,
their
wealth
or
their
place
of
employment.
that
would
--
that
would
do
away
the
classifications
of
farmers
against
city
dwellers.
it
would
do
away
the
--
of
the
classification
of
people
in
the
--
in
industry
or
people
who
are
not
in
industry
or
people
in
professions
who
are
not
in
professions
or
classifications
based
on
civilian
against
military
or
classifications
based
on
large
geographical
areas
or
smaller
geographical
areas
because
area
--
acres
don't
vote,
it's
on
the
persons
that
vote.
or
classifications
that
are
based
purely
on
governmental
units
as
such
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
governmental
units
within
a
state
have
no
sovereignty
but
are
purely
preachers
of
the
state.
the
--
particularly
is
that
true
in
the
state
of
virginia
where
the
counties
and
the
cities
are
purely
preachers
of
the
legislature
and
where
the
legislature
of
virginia
can
do
as
it
did
to
arlington
when
arlington
stated
that
it
would
comply
with
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
brown
against
board
of
education
and
desegregated
schools,
the
legislature
within
30
days
took
away
the
elective
school
board
that
arlington
was
very
proud
of
and
--
and
required
that
school
board
to
be
appointed
by
other
means.
it
--
it
is
a
--
it's
a
great
importance
to
--
to
any
community
in
a
state
such
as
virginia.
now
within
this
framework,
as
judge
bryan
again
said
and
i
--
i
suggest
that
this
might
a
--
a
proper
holding
for
this
court
that
the
state
may
consider
compactness
and
conti
--
contiguity
of
territory,
community
of
interest
of
the
people,
observance
of
natural
lines
and
conformity
to
historic
provisions
such
as
county
lines.
there
again
though
the
burden
is
on
the
state
when
judge
bryan
said,
"additionally,
of
course
we
must
accept
this
to
establish
such
reasons
for
the
redistricting
as
a
fairly
conceivable
or
impairable
from
the
result.
if
the
court
would
accept
--
would
adopt
those
standards,
it
could
give
to
the
district
courts
a
basis
on
which
they
could
proceed
to
what
themselves
out
of
this
political
thicket
and
by
which
this
court
could
then
proceed
to
hear
cases
when
necessary
on
the
merits
on
a
basis
of
acceptance
to
the
--
to
the
general
principles.
this,
i
take
it
would
also
--
if
--
if
the
court
should
accept
this,
it
would
also
take
care
of
mr.
mays'
argument
which
he
made
to
this
court
on
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
if
a
--
if
the
right
to
vote
is
a
transcendent
vote,
it
is
or
in
any
event
it
is
protected
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
should
--
and
mr.
mays'
argument
i
--
i
trust
should
be
disposed
of
by
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
mcneese
against
the
board
of
education
just
a
few
months
ago.
here
in
virginia,
there
are
no
strands
of
local
law
woven
into
this
case
which
could
possibly
move
to
federal
question.
there's
no
question,
for
instance,
of
the
boundary
between
alexandria
and
arlington
or
the
boundaries
between
one
community
and
another
which
might
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
issue
is
purely
one
of
equal
protection
under
the
federal
constitution
and
the
fact
that
these
plaintiffs
may
or
may
not
have
a
remedy
in
a
state
court
under
mcneese
is
completely
immaterial.
mr.
mays
suggested
and
sought
to
distinguish
between
the
voting
right
cases
or
distinguish
these
voting
right
cases
from
the
segregation
cases
by
saying
that
in
segregation
cases
involved
only
plucking
out
an
individual
child
and
not
the
state
governments
as
such
whereas
the
voting
right
cases
interfere
with
state
governments.
mr.
mays
has
forgotten,
(inaudible)
has
forgotten,
jackson,
he
has
forgotten,
cooper
against
aaron,
he
has
forgotten
the
--
the
--
he
--
he
does
not
know
what
he
says
when
he
says
that
because
the
voting
right
cases
i
suggest
to
your
honors,
do
not
involve
great
social
customs.
it
involves
a
--
a
--
decision
in
the
voting
right
case,
this
involves
only
a
single
surgical
operation
if
you
please,
because
once
this
legislature
is
correctly
apportioned,
once
the
matter
is
taken
cared
of
by
the
judiciary
or
by
the
legislature
as
i
hope
the
legislatures
would
in
most
instances
take
care
of
it,
the
people
themselves
are
grateful
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
effect
of
reapportionment
in
state
cases
--
in
state
legislatures
will
be
not
to
take
away
state
rights
or
state
powers
but
rather
to
restore
the
states
to
their
primary
functions
because
it
will
permit
the
states
to
conduct
affirmative
government
sought
by
the
majority
and
not
simply
to
conduct
negative
government
at
the
will
of
rural
minorities
or
other
minorities
who
do
not
wish
services
or
other
actions
taken
by
our
services
given
or
other
actions
taken
by
the
state.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
i
--
i
--
i
would
like
a
little
more
firm
than
judge
bryan
has
made
sir
but
we
are
very
happy
with
mr.
judge
bryan's
decision,
yes
sir.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
correct
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
it
certainly
is
mr.
justice
goldberg.
the
other
argument
which
mr.
mays
made
on
the
question
of
abstention,
he
said
that
--
that
a
voting
--
that
segregation
cases
involve
the
question
of
an
education
of
a
child
here
and
now.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
voting
right
cases
--
if
the
voting
rights
are
--
what
we
assert
they
are,
if
the
voting
right
of
a
citizen
is
equally
a
matter
here
and
now,
and
that
if
once
lost,
it
is
lost
forever
in
this
particular
premise,
in
this
particular
situation
in
which
the
--
in
which
the
citizen
is
called
upon
to
cast
his
ballot.
it's
not
like
for
a
suit
for
recovery
of
taxes.
it's
not
like
a
suit
to
a
--
on
a
question
of
getting
just
compensation
for
condemnation.
it's
not
like
a
dozen
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
this
is
a
--
an
--
as
appropriate
as
this
as
the
segregation
cases
for
direct
action
at
all
times
by
this
court.
the
court
could
also
almost
take
judicial
notice
to
the
fact
that
in
certain
of
the
states
there
have
been
almost
massive
resistance
to
--
to
reapportionment
and
that
the
only
way
that
we
can
get
actual
relief
is
through
the
federal
courts.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
mr.
mcilwaine's
proposition
that
--
that
virginia
does
not
have
an
irrational
system,
that
it
is
simply
a
--
a
method
of
taking
care
of
the
thinly
populated
areas
at
the
expense
of
the
thickly
populated
areas,
whatever
is
that,
may
it
please.
i
was
--
can
assure
your
honors,
i
--
i
trust
in
a
few
very
brief
instances
that
virginia
is
--
is
the
most
crazy
quilt
of
crazy
--
crazy

for
example,
the
city
of

a
citizen
of

has
one
delegate
for
95
or
91,000
people.
his
neighbor
in
loudoun
county,
leesburg,
dulles

his
vote
counts
for
four
times

much
as
the
vote
of

these
immediately
closely

they

mr.

generally

not
as
quite
as
fairly

as
this

but
judge
bryan
said
in
his
opinion
"that
a
citizen
of
arlington,

has
representation
in

this
is

adjacent
com
--
adjacent
counties
would
be
very
simple
to
--
to
rearrange
them.
the
--
the
bureau
of
public
administration
which
was
consulted
by
the
commission
appointed
by
the
governor
to
consider
reapportionment
had
suggested
rearrangements
which
made
a
variation
of
only
17%
in
the
--
in
the
--
for
mathematical
equality
if
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
leave
this
--
this
crazy
quilt.
and
leave
manassas
and
prince
william
county,
the
suburban
county
packed
on
to
this
rural
or
district
extending
for
a
110-120
miles
down
the
--
down
the
--
in
the
northern
neck
as
to
virginia
and
say.
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
the
other
day,
virginia
or
might
be
or
suppose
a
state
is
--
is
fairly
reapportioned
but
leaves
out
one
county.
my
friends
take
the
position
that
virginia
ranks
8th
among
the
union
in
reapportionment
and
therefore
it
is
not
badly
apportioned.
a
crazy
quilt
may
work
out
that
way
but
let's
assume
that
virginia
were
exactly
mathematically
proportioned
in
every
one
of
the
97
counties
except
--
of
the
98
counties
except
the
county
of
loudoun
which
holds
less
than
1%
of
the
population.
the
effect
of
that
would
be
that
virginia
was
99%
correctly
apportioned
or
49
--
it
would
take
49%
of
the
people
to
--
to
elect
the
majorities
of
the
legislature
and
yet
could
anyone
say
that
such
an
act
would
be
--
it
would
grant
to
the
citizens
of
loudoun
county
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
and
so
we
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
citizens
of
arlington
and
fairfax
if
the
proposition
is
not
one
of
whether
the
state
of
how
--
how
many
voters
it
takes
to
elect
the
majority
but
whether
any
substantial
groups
of
persons
are
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
any
substantial
group
such
as
any
county
or
community
such
as
--
as
fairfax
or
arlington
or
norfolk
or
hampton
or
chesterfield
county
or
district
28
involving
manassas
and
--
and
prince
william.
i
--
i
--
i'm
about
ready
to
stop.
now
if
the
court
please,
the
--
i
--
i
would
like
simply
to
--
to
--
to
conclude
by
saying
by
reiterating
that
if
representative
government
is
to
--
is
to
be
maintained,
majorities
have
to
have
the
affirmative
power
of
government
subject
to
the
self-restrictions
as
may
appropriately
be
imposed
upon
the
minority.
that
if
a
minority
is
in
control
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
it
is
so
in
control
that
there
is
a
lot
in
oligarchy,
a
lot
in
control
by
a
--
by
a
minority
which
cannot
be
changed
except
by
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
or
the
--
or
the
force
of
the
judicial
power
to
suggest
to
the
judicial
power
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
in
virginia
as
mr.
mays
pointed
out,
the
people
do
not
have
the
right
to
initiate
a
constitutional
convention
or
to
initiate
an
amendment
to
their
constitution.
in
virginia,
the
only
persons
who
can
do
it
are
the
very
legislative
minorities
which
would
assume
that
control.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
they
have
reapportioned
every
10
years
mr.
justice
stewart
but
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
in
1962
is
the
re
--
is
the
last
reapportionment
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
and
it
is
that
one
which
is
under
attack.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
or
it
--
it
has
been
done
every
10
years
though
as
we
assert
completely
inadequately.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
you
see
--
in
--
in
--
in
fairness
to
virginia
and
i
am
a
virginian
and
i
--
i
too
love
the
state.
in
fairness
to
virginia,
virginia
has
made
some
sort
of
gesture
toward
reapportionment
or
every
decennial.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
that
is
--
that
is
correct
though.
that
are
those
are
not
the
only
inequities
with
this
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
the
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
mr.
justice
black,
here
--
mean
the
variation
between
21
and
29?
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
i
would
say
that
is
not
--
not
greatly
substantial.
i
mean
the
--
the
way
that
it
--
the
average
population
for
delegates
should
be
39,000
in
virginia
based
on
a
population
--
population
of
based
on
upon
100
delegates
and
a
population
of
3,900,000
as
virginia
has.
they
--
the
--
all
of
this
group
of
counties
are
substantially
overrepresented
on
a
basis
of
39,000
which
is
the
appropriate
basis.
i
--
i'm
positive
this
would
answer
mr.
--
your
question
mr.
justice
black,
the
commission
which
--
of
the
bureau
of
public
administration
which
made
proposed
redistricting
for
virginia,
suggested
that
it
would
be
difficult
under
any
circumstances
to
justify
a
variation
of
more
than
25%.
its
proposals
came
within
17%
variation.
a
25%
variation
would
mean
really
a
50%
difference
that
is
25%
of
above
and
25%
below
the
line
would
mean
if
--
there
might
be
as
much
as
50%
variation
between
certain
districts.
i
sug
--
suggest
in,
if
possible
this
is
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question
that
that
would
be
the
maximum
under
any
circumstances
which
--
which
ought
to
be
allowed.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
and
certainly,
a
2-to-1
basis
on
the
basis
of
--
of
your
honor's
own
opinion
in
macdougall
against
green
would
--
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
i
think
that
might
well
come
within
the
range
of
--
of
permissible
variation
from
a
--
a
strict
population
standard
having
in
mind
the
governmental
subdivisions
as
a
subsidiary
basis
of
classification.
it
is
on
page
100
that
--
of
the
record
that
the
bureau
of
public
administration
of
the
university
of
virginia
makes
its
recommendation
that
direct
that
the
deviation
from
the
ideal
size
be
as
little
as
possible
with
most
deviation
within
15%
of
ideal
size
and
acceptance
in
the
most
difficult
situations
within
25%.
it
is
difficult
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
that
would
be
50%
variation
really.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
want
it?
yes.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
would
hope
that
--
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
justified
on
some
basis
of
--
of
--
that
you
can't
do
it
any
better.
they
obviously
must
be
some
play
in
the
joints
or
as
--
as
this
court
has
said
but
--
but
the
burden
needs
to
be
on
--
on
those
who
would
justify
a
variation.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
no,
no
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
but
--
yes,
i
--
yes
mr.
justice.
if
--
if
the
deviation
is
not
done.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
is
or
--
or
is
not.
yes
so
it's
not
excessive
or
if
the
deviation
shown
in
maryland
by
counties
or
in
certain
area
--
by
counties
or
in
virginia
by
counties
would
be
stupendous
if
you
have
one
for
each
county.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
what
reason
has
been
given
by
the
legislature?
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
the
legislature
has
given
no
reason
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
the
only
reason
i
know
is
--
is
i
did
--
there
are
two
reasons
that
--
that
conceivably
have
been
given
by
opposition
here.
one
of
them
--
i
understood
that
--
that
arlington
and
fairfax
have
more
military
personnel
and
--
and
the
other
reason
is
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
though
in
taking
the
solicitor
general's
brief
on
page
39,
third
--
the
solicitor
general
points
out
and
he
has
a
--
a
complete
--
complete
statement
of
--
of
the
military
population
in
each
community.
in
37
and
39,
in
39
this
--
this
with
the
house
of
delegates
are
even
using
civilian
population
alone.
the
solicitor
general
points
out
that
the
two
most
overrepresented
districts
have
over
four
times
the
representation
of
fairfax.
the
17th
of
the
70
districts
have
over
three
times
the
representation
and
its,
40
out
of
the
70
districts
have
over
twice
the
representation
to
fairfax
taking
civilian
population
alone,
i
mean
excluding
the
military.
the
other
argument
which
mr.
mcilwaine
gave
are
as
the
justification
whereas
the
justification
of
the
rural
against
the
urban.
but
i
trust
i
have
shown
that
it
is
in
the
briefs
that
that
simply
were
not
(inaudible),
that
the
discrimination
is
a
patchwork,
crazy
quilt
discrimination
which
wholly
departs
from
any
such
formula.
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
arlington
and
fairfax
are
rapidly
growing
communities.
they're
almost
doubling
in
population
every
10
years.
the
legislature
in
attempting
to
reapportion
and
give
arlington
and
fairfax
it's
proper
--
to
their
proper
representation,
has
to
as
a
practical
matter,
take
delegates
away
from
some
other
district
or
combine
some
other
districts
because
of
--
of
the
present
maximum
of
100
if
you're
going
to
enforce
that.
i
would
say
that
it
was
human
reluctance
of
legislators
to
vote
themselves
right
out
--
out
of
arms.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
edmund
d.
campbell
there
is
a
constitutional
maximum
in
virginia
of
100
members
of
the
house
of
delegates.
i
--
i
--
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
however
that
that
--
that
if
--
if
the
only
way
arlington
and
fairfax
could
be
properly
represented
would
be
to
give
them
a
additional
delegates
in
the
present
general
assembly
that
--
that
maximum
would
not
stand
as
against
the
fourteenth
amendment.
my
colleague
mr.
howell,
would
like
to
use
a
balance
of
our
time.
