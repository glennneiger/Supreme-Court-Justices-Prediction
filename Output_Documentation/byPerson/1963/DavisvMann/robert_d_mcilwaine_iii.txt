mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
indicated
by
my
colleague,
the
legislative
power
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
vested
in
a
general
assembly
comprising
a
senate
and
a
house
of
delegates.
the
senate
is
composed
of
40
members;
the
house
of
delegates
is
composed
of
100
members,
each
figure
representing
the
maximum
that
is
allowed
under
the
virginia
constitution.
section
43
of
the
virginia
constitution
provides
that
there
shall
be
reapportionment
in
the
year
1932
and
every
10
years
thereafter.
this
constitutional
mandate
has
been
faithfully
performed.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
goldberg
but
i
say
that's
been
faithfully
performed,
i
meant
that
there
was
an
apportionment
every
10
years
within
the
framework
of
what
the
general
assembly
thought
was
appropriate.
what
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
state
officials,
your
honor,
that
the
apportionment
is
proper.
however,
there
is
--
there
are
numerous
information
which
is
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
state
officials
that
their
law
is
constitutional
in
any
other
field
only
to
find
out
that
they
have
misread
the
constitution
or
the
organic
law
of
the
state
and
be
affirmed
by
a
state
supreme
court
that
is
not
so.
mr.
justice
--
i
mean
judge
bryan
in
the
lower
court
seem
to
indicate
that
the
fact
that
the
virginia
apportionment
must
follow
the
decennial
federal
census
plus
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
"apportion"
might
lead
a
court
to
the
conclusion
that
not
only
is
population
one
of
the
important
factors,
but
is
a
factor
so
predominant
that
the
population
variance
ratios
which
exist
under
the
virginia
reapportionment,
slight
as
they
are,
may
still
exceed
the
constitutional
standard
prescribed
for
apportionment
under
section
43.
we
do
not
believe
so,
but
the
possibility
exists.
this,
of
course,
is
the
slender
side
of
the
argument
being
made
by
my
colleague.
in
the
case
at
bar,
no
assertion
is
made
that
the
virginia
reapportionment
discriminates
against
any
group
or
any
individuals,
upon
the
basis
of
race,
creed,
national
origin,
political
persuasion
or
in
the
rural-urban
control
of
the
general
assembly.
on
the
contrary,
the
attack
upon
the
virginia
reapportionment
system
is
based
exclusively
upon
certain
numerical
disparities
which
admittedly
exist
between
the
populations
embraced
in
certain
of
a
house
and
senate
districts
as
created
by
the
general
assembly
in
its
1962
reapportionment
act.
in
virginia
insofar
as
the
house
concerned,
the
maximum
population
variance
ratio
which
exists
between
districts
is
4.36-to-1.
so
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
the
maximum
population
variance
ratio
is
2.65-to-1.
these
ratios
are
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
total
population
figures
which
include
military-related
personnel
and
as
suggested
by
my
colleague
which
is
unquestionably
true,
include
all
the
personnel
who
happen
to
be
on
board
united
states
naval
vessels
or
vessels
of
the
united
states
merchant
marine
berthed
in
virginia
ports
at
that
time
regardless
of
where
--
what
citizenship
the
individuals
on
those
vessels
might
profess.
as
an
additional
statistic,
the
4.36-to-1
ratio,
that
is
the
ratio
which
exceeds
4%.
this
occurs
in
virginia
in
only
two
instances.
there
are
70
house
districts
and
36
senate
districts
for
a
total
of
106
legislative
districts.
in
only
two
instances
in
a
106
districts
does
the
population
variance
ratio
exceed
4-to-1.
in
only
two
more
instances,
does
the
population
variance
ratio
exceed
3-to-1
and
in
a
total
of
only
25
instances
including
the
four
that
i've
already
mentioned,
in
only
25
instances
out
of
106
does
the
population
variance
ratio
even
exceed
2-to-1.
now,
these
comparatively
minor
population
variance
ratios
are
due
to
two
features
of
the
virginia
reapportionment
system
and
they
are
negative
features.
the
first
is
that
the
virginia
reapportionment
system
does
not
use
the
federal
analog.
it
does
not
undertake
to
structure
one
house
on
the
basis
of
population,
and
another
house,
on
the
basis
of
area
or
geographical
districts.
moreover,
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
virginia
constitution
similar
to
the
ohio
constitution
or
to
the
new
york
constitution
or
to
the
new
jersey
constitution
as
i
understand
it
with
respect
to
the
house
that
guarantees
one
member
of
our
house
of
delegates
or
more
populous
branch
of
our
legislature
guarantees
one
delegate
to
each
political
subdivision
because
we
do
not
have
those
requirements.
our
population
variance
ratios
are
extremely,
greatly
diminished
compared
to
those
states
which
do
have
the
requirement
of
one
representative
for
each
particular
political
subdivision.
moreover,
the
importance
which
virginia
has
placed
upon
population
not
as
the
predominant
factor,
but
as
one
of
the
principal
factors
in
reapportionment
has
caused
us
to
achieve
the
rank
of
eight
on
the
index
of
representativeness
of
the
entire
50
states
in
the
union.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
are
on
a
per
capita
basis.
the
importance
which
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
attaches
to
being
sure
that
less
populous
counties,
or
less
populous
areas
whether
they
be
counties
or
cities
or
thinly
populated
areas
as
used
in
the
mcdougall
case
in
this
court
are
not
overborne
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
but
do
have
an
effective
voice
in
the
general
assembly
which
the
--
which
the
general
assembly
feels
would
not
be
true
if
a
straight
per
capita
basis
were
laid
down.
we
fell
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
and
this
is
where
we
clash
head
on
with
the
solicitor
general
and
we
are
not
loath
to
do
so.
we
feel
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
is
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
which
forbids
a
state
to
assure
a
proper
diffusion
of
its
political
initiative
as
between
its
thinly
populated
areas
on
the
one
hand
and
those
having
concentrated
masses
on
the
other.
this,
we
say,
is
the
law.
we
can
understand
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
appreciate
and
he
takes
the
position
that
the
mcdougall
principle
which
was
re-enunciated
in
this
court
in
baker
versus
carr.
mr.
justice
clark
said,
“i
take
the
law
of
this
case,”
from
mcdougall
versus
green.
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
mcdougall
versus
green
as
a
settled
precedent.
mr.
justice
harlan
cited
“in
--
in
support
of
a
proposition
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
choose
a
method
of
apportionment
which
satisfied
its
political
institutions
and
best
represented
its
people
were
settled
by
the
law
as
stated
in
mcdougal
versus
green.
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
to
assure
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
initiative
between
its
thinly
populated
counties
and
those
having
concentrated
masses."
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
by
the
phrase
from
mcdougall
that
i
just
quoted?
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
would
understand
it
your
honor,
to
be
--
the
same
way
that
text
writers
have
interpreted
to
mean
this,
"that
there
is
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
forbids
a
state
to
achieve
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
power
as
between
rural
and
urban
areas?
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
it
can
depart
from
the
straight
per
capita
of
principle
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
but
if
you
are
assuming
your
honor
that
the
vote
would
count
for
more
if
they
voted
on
a
one
man-one
vote
principle
within
their
own
particular
district.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
assume
that
the
fact
that
districts
are
not
equal,
weights,
the
vote
of
the
individual
in
that
district
has
the
necessary
effect
of
weighting
the
vote
of
the
individual
in
the
underrepresented
district
more
so
then
that
of
a
--
a
district
which
has
less
than
the
populous
ratio.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
in
--
in
principle
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
--
that
is
what
i
mean.
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
in
principle
that
is
what
i
mean.
now,
i
think
at
sometime
your
honor
on
the
scale,
taking
the
ultimate
example
of
where
you
give
baltimore
city
no
representatives
and
give
all
the
rest
of
the
representatives
to
the
outlying
areas,
you
reach
a
point
where
the
departure
from
the
per
capita
principle
may
be
so
great
as
to
overbear.
the
equally
important
point
that
i
am
making
that
there
must
be
some
accommodation
for
the
thinly
populated
areas.
i
agree
that
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
can
be
extreme
that
that
can
be
true.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
your
honor
--
those
in
the
heavily
populated
areas
is
the
language
of
the
court's
opinion
in
mcdougall,
whether
you
call
them
cities
or
urban
county
or
suburban
counties.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
if
--
if
there's
history
i
think
for
in
every
stage
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
is
well
known
a
version
for
cities
--
this
city
life
i
suppose
the
rural
life
would
do
so
and
yet
we
feel
that
in
virginia,
a
practical
accommodation
has
been
made
between
two
competing
principles
of
equal
importance.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
richmond
is
also
underrepresented,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well
we've
--
insofar
as
the
--
the
ratios
are
concerned
your
honor
with
the
exclusion
of
military
population
or
military-related
population,
the
ratio
is
not
that
large
and
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
think
it
does
your
honor,
i
think
it
reduces
the
amount
of
areas
between
how
much
richmond
is
under
represented
and
how
much
arlington
is
underrepresented.
both
of
them
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
think
we
can
your
honor
because
we
achieved
in
the
virginia
a
practically
perfect
balance
between
those
representatives
in
our
senate
which
represent
thinly
populated
or
rural
or
agrarian
areas,
if
you
will,
and
those
which
represent
heavily
populated
or
metropolitan
or
areas
having
concentrated
masses,
again
we
use
the
language
of
mcdougall
versus
green.
we
achieved
a
practically
perfect
balance
in
our
senate
and
in
our
house.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
would
be
some
deviation
but
i
submit
that
if
the
--
the
population
in
arlington
and
richmond
were
reversed,
it
would
make
no
change
--
there
would
have
been
no
change
in
the
amount
of
representatives
that
called
at
each.
it
is
simply
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
to
some
extent
a
diminution
of
the
per
capita
representation
in
those
areas
which
have
heavily
concentrated
masses
in
favor
of
those
that
have
less
--
which
are
more
thinly
populated,
there
is
going
to
work
out
within
the
class
of
the
heavily
populated
areas
certain
differences.
you
cannot
reach
mathematical
perfection.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
you
remove
the
military-related
population,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no
sir.
the
military-related
population
has
this
effect
for
us.
with
the
removal
of
the
military-related
population,
you
substantially
diminish
the
maximum
population
variance
ratios
which
exists
on
a
state-wide
basis
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
without
any
classification
at
all.
removal
of
military-related
populations
substantially
diminishes
the
population
variance
ratios
in
our
state
from
over
4-to-1,
4.36-to-1
to
less
than
4
down
to
3.7
in
our
senate
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
in
general,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
very
well,
we
have
attempted
to
do
it
with
respect
to
these
particular
areas
on
the
table
a
and
b
of
pages
16
and
17
of
our
reply
brief
and
we
have
undertaken
to
show
what
the
variance
ratios
would
be
with
respect
to
area
--
to
these
particular
areas
which
are
with
one
exception,
a
portion
of
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
as
that
figure
is
used
by
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
bureau
of
census.
the
first
district
there,
the

with
a
population
removed,
it
has
a
total
population
for
a
senator,
table

of

it
is,
as
you
will
see,
against
the
standard
of
90,000
and
underrepresented
area
in
the
senate
but
it
is
also
a
portion
of
a
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
we
are
assuming
that
it
is
appropriate
to
depart
from
a
per
capita
principle
in
order
to
assure
an
effective
voice
into
legislature
for
those
areas
having
less
population
or
for
those
areas
which
are
thinly
populated
to
use
the
language
of
what
we
understand
to
be
the
law.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
norfolk

mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,

i
was
just
going
to

mr.

have

91,

109
and
you
will
find
that
most
of
the
variance
ratios
in

are
within
an
area
of
40%
on
either
side
of
the
theoretic
ideal
for
population.
mr.

it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert

mcilwaine,
iii
i
--
i
would
like
to
try
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
solicitor
general
on
this
point,
we
feel
was
less
than
kind,
less
than
objective
and
less
than
accurate
when
he
said
ascribe
to
virginia
this
proposition,
"virginia
includes
the
military
because
we
take
the
position
that
the
military
aren't
worthy
of
representation
in
our
general
assembly.
that
is
not
the
reason
they
are
excluded
and
in
our
brief,
we
pointed
our
brief,
which
the
solicitor
general
had
in
his
hands
when
he
wrote
his
reply
brief
and
when
he
made
that
statement,
they
are
excluded
because
of
non-citizenship
in
virginia,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
excluded
because
the
military
population
in
virginia
is
not
a
population
made
up
of
virginia
citizens,
we
pointed
out.
it
is
well
known
that
the
military
population
is
highly
transient
that
it
has
a
high
mobility
rate
and
that
it
is
fundamentally
non-soliciting
in
character.
we
thought
we
would
not
have
to
prove
that
that
it
would
be
universally
recognized
and
the
court
will
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
in
the
federal
suit.
when
we
got
into
the
state
court
suit,
we
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
we
might
be
called
upon
to
prove
the
obvious
and
so
in
the
state
court
suit,
we
did
prove
it.
the
research
associates
of
the
department
of
population
and
economic
research
of
the
university
of
virginia,
taking
the
government's
tables
as
provided
by
the
bureau
of
census,
estimated
that
two
and
two-tenths
percent
of
the
military
population
in
virginia
would
be
virginia
citizens
and
that's
all.
no
one
is
excluded
in
virginia
because
he
is
in
the
military
per
se.
the
military
are
excluded
on
a
basis
which
even
the
solicitor
general
accepts
as
a
proper
method,
that
is
to
say
citizenship.
when
he
opened
his
argument
here,
in
the
new
york
case,
he
started
out
with
the
first
principle
of
saying
the
starting
point
of
all
representation
is
per
capita
representation
and
mr.
justice
stewart
leaned
forward
and
said,
"per
capita
what
mr.
solicitor
general,
per
capita
population,
per
capita
inhabitants,
per
capita
citizens,
per
capita
registered
voters,
per
capita
actual
voters
or
eligible
voters,
per
capita
of
what"
and
the
solicitor
general
said,
"citizenship."
now
in
virginia,
we
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
to
remove
the
military-related
population
not
because
they
are
in
the
military.
virginia
has
a
military
tradition
second
to
none
and
if
our
citizens
are
in
the
military
as
least
pointed
out
by
the
government's
brief,
we
do
everything
possible
to
enable
our
virginia
citizens
to
vote
in
virginia.
and
even
if
they're
in
the
military
by
waiving
registration,
waiving
the
full
taxes,
bringing
them
in
under
the
absentee
ballot
and
our
the
citizens
are
permitted
to
vote
with
less
restrictions
if
they
are
in
the
military
than
our
actual
civilian
citizens.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
do
not,
your
honor,
this
category
do
not
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
do
not
include
the
aliens.
we
do
not
understand
that
there
is
in
virginia
a
substantial
alien
population
as
there
would
be
in
new
york
which
does
expressly
exclude
aliens
under
their
constitutional
formula.
now,
this
--
this
can
run
to
three
categories,
your
honor.
you
could
exclude
the
military
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
non-citizens.
you
can
also
exclude
aliens
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
non-citizens.
you
could
include
--
exclude
inmates
of
institutions,
penitentiaries
and
mental
institutions
perhaps
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
non-citizens
but
regardless
of
the
classification,
the
ground
for
exclusion
is
non-citizenship.
now,
if
there
is
not
a
substantial
alien
population
as
we
do
not
feel
there
is
in
virginia,
if
there
is
not
a
substantial
institutional
population,
the
legislature
may
just
include
this
as
being
de
minimis,
but
where
you
have
a
substantial
military
population,
and
where
that
military
population
is
concentrated
in
one
particular
area
or
in
two
or
three
particular
areas
in
our
instance,
the
tidewater
area,
norfolk,
hampton,
newport
news,
fort
worth,
around
hampton
roads
and
in
the
northern
part
of
virginia
around
the
state
of
washington,
arlington,
alexandria,
fairfax.
we
think
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
to
ensure
that
the
less
populous
areas
around
the
county
are
not
overwritten
by
a
sheer
rate
of
numbers
when
the
sheer
rate
of
numbers
has
been
grossly
inflated
with
people
who
are
not
even
citizens
of
virginia.
why
should
norfolk
have
an
additional
delegate
because
on
a
particular
day,
there
happen
to
be
40,000
non-citizens
of
virginia's
on
shipboard
who
might
have
been
in
the
port
of
norfolk
at
that
time?
may
i
suggest
one
other
thing?
the
figure
of
two
and
two-tenths
percent,
i
say
is
in
fact
in
the
state
case,
it
is
not
a
fact
of
record
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
principles
formulated
in
the
brief
and
advocated
at
the
bar
of
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
undertakes
to
condemn
the
virginia
reapportionment
system
as
violative
of
the
second
postulate
he
lays
down
in
that
the
virginia
system
allegedly
departs
from
the
per
capita
standard
without
rhyme
or
reason.
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
deny
that
the
virginia
system
may
be
criticized
upon
this
ground
but
we
believe
it
is
clear
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
relatively
minor
departures
which
exist
in
the
virginia
system
are
occasioned
by
a
legislative
attempt
to
assure
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
initiative
as
between
thinly
populated
areas
of
the
state
and
those
having
concentrated
masses
in
conformity
with
the
law
laid
down
by
this
court
in
macdougall
and
recently
reapproved
in
--
reaffirmed
in
baker
against
carr.
as
we
attempted
to
point
out
last
thursday,
the
macdougall
principles
were
stated
by
this
court
in
baker
to
constitute
several
princ
--
precedents
and
to
constitute
below
of
the
case.
as
we
understand
it,
advancement
of
this
reason
effectively
removes
us
from
the
--
without
rhyme
or
reason
category
of
the
solicitor
general
but
presumably
impales
us
upon
the
opposite
form
of
the
dilemma
erected
by
his
third
postulate
that
is
that
the
reason
advanced
does
not
constitute
a
permissible
purpose
of
state
legislative
apportionment.
as
we
understand
it,
the
solicitor
general
likened
operation
of
these
two
principles
to
the
opposing
action
of
a
pair
of
shears,
either
we
do
not
have
a
reason
or
if
we
do
have
a
reason,
it
is
a
legally
impermissible
one.
in
response
to
this,
we
assert
that
the
assurance
of
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
initiative
between
thinly
populated
areas
and
those
having
concentrated
masses
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
permissible
purpose
of
state
apportionment,
one
expressly
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
macdougall.
such
differ
--
since
which
occur
as
a
result
of
the
diffusion
effectively
causes
the
minority
or
thinly
populated
areas
of
the
state
to
be
represented
in
the
counsels
of
government
to
prevent
such
areas
from
being
completely
overridden
by
the
sheer
weight
of
numbers
while
still
living
to
the
areas
having
concentrated
masses,
the
practical
opportunity
for
asserting
their
weight
at
the
polls
which
is
not
available
to
the
thinly
populated
areas.
two
aspects
of
the
presentation
of
the
case
at
bar
stand
out
in
connection
with
this
reason.
the
first
is,
we
believe
that
in
none
of
his
briefs
which
he
has
filed
in
the
various
reapportionment
cases
now
under
consideration,
has
the
solicitor
general
attempted
to
meet
the
argument
predicated
upon
macdougall.
in
his
brief
in
the
new
york
case,
he
brushes
the
macdougall
principle
aside
as
a
generality.
in
his
compendious
brief
in
the
maryland
case,
he
asserts
that
macdougall,
despite
its
citation
by
various
members
of
this
court
in
baker
has
no
application
to
state
reapportionment
cases.
and
in
his
brief
filed
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
solicitor
general
does
not
make
any
reference
to
the
macdougall
case
or
even
cite
it
in
his
brief.
and
this
absence
of
any
reference
or
citation
is
highlighted
we
believe
by
the
fact
that
in
our
brief,
we
advanced
the
macdougall
principle
as
being
foremost
among
the
principles
which
are
applicable
to
cases
of
this
character.
the
second
aspect
we
believe
is
that
in
reliance
upon
--
in
defense
of
his
position,
the
solicitor
general
relies
upon
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
macdougall
case.
we
therefore
think
it
is
unarguably
clear
that
acceptance
of
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
necessarily
entails
a
flat
rejection
of
the
macdougall
principle
and
overruling
of
the
holding
of
that
case
and
the
elevation
of
the
minority
view
to
the
position
of
the
majority
view.
the
solicitor
general's
arguments,
we
feel
cannot
be
countenance
under
the
existing
law
as
to
what
may
be
deemed
a
proper
diffusion
of
political
power
between
thinly
populated
and
heavily
populated
areas,
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
lack
the
ability
to
state
dispositively
where
the
outer
limits
of
propriety
lie
in
this
field
or
to
articulate
the
criteria
by
which
these
outer
limits
shall
be
ascertained.
fortunately,
we
feel
that
in
the
case
at
bar
is
it
--
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
do
so.
we
take
this
position
only
that
where
a
state
has
so
structured
its
legislature
as
to
achieve
a
balance,
an
almost
perfect
balance
between
the
representation
of
thinly
populated
and
heavily
populated
areas,
has
achieved
this
balance
without
giving
rise
to
any
population-variance
ratio
which
exceeds
that
of
the
electoral
college
of
the
united
states
and
has
achieved
this
balance
in
a
method
which
causes
its
state
to
rank
eighth
in
fairness
of
representation
based
solely
on
population
in
the
united
states
that
such
a
reapportionment
as
this
clearly
constitutes
a
proper
diffusion
as
to
what
more
or
what
less
may
also
constitute
a
proper
diffusion,
we
need
not
say.
we
do
point
out
however
that
the
reapportionment
systems
of
at
least
nine
states
which
could
not
possibly
pass
most
under
the
rigorous
standard
that
i
had
just
laid
down
have
already
been
approved
in
federal
district
courts
and
in
the
supreme
courts
of
the
various
states,
the
states
of
florida,
georgia,
idaho,
illinois,
louisiana,
maryland,
new
jersey,
new
york,
and
ohio.
in
these
states,
the
population-variance
ratios
range
from
8-to-1
to
62-to-1
and
all
of
these
states
are
beneath
virginia
on
the
index
of
representativeness
or
fairness
of
representation
computed
solely
on
the
basis
of
per
capita
principles.
we
therefore
submit
that
if
the
virginia
reapportionment
system
is
annulled,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
reapportionment
systems
of
these
nine
states
which
rank
less
fair
than
virginia
must
also
be
annulled
as
well
are
the
--
as
well
as
the
reapportionment
systems
of
the
other
33
states
which
also
have
reapportionment
systems
which
are
not
as
fair
on
a
per
capita
basis
as
virginia's.
we
also
state
that
if
the
virginia
apportionment
system
is
annulled
and
those
are
the
other
nine
states
is
approved,
is
it
not
incontestably
true
that
the
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
in
these
cases
will
themselves
become
a
topsy-turvical
of
gigantic
proportions
and
will
not
these
opinions
form
a
pattern
or
a
crazy
quilt
without
rational
basis
laid
down
by
the
judiciary
rather
than
by
the
legislature.
we
have
one
other
suggestion
in
connection
with
our
observations
and
that
is
that
if
the
principles
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
are
so
fundamental
and
pervasive
as
he
suggested
they
are,
is
it
not
more
than
passing
strange
that
judges
waterman,
levet
and
ryan
of
new
york,
judge
weick,
weinmann
and
peck
of
ohio,
judges
wisdom,
west
and
ellis
of
louisiana,
judge
schnackenberg
and
campbell
of
illinois,
the
entire
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
idaho
and
judges
jones,
mccree
and
dyer
of
florida
did
not
only
fail
to
apply
these
principles
but
did
not
even
recognize
their
existence.
with
respect
to
the
two
technical
points,
we
would
like
to
stress
that
if
the
military
related
population
may
effectively
be
removed
or
excluded
in
determining
the
inhabitants
of
a
particular
area
for
the
purposes
of
representation
then
even
under
the
figures
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general,
all
foundation
for
any
claim
by
the
city
of
norfolk
that
it
has
been
discriminated
against
by
the
challenged
statutes
disappears.
for
under
those
figure,
norfolk
is
only
slightly
underrepresented
in
the
senate
and
is
indeed
actually
overrepresented
in
the
house
of
delegates
of
virginia.
we
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
we
believe
to
be
fundamental
deficiencies
in
the
majority
opinion,
in
that
at
no
point
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
below,
is
any
reference
made
to
any
evidence
whatever
put
in
by
the
defendants
in
defense
of
the
virginia
reapportionment
system.
your
honors
have
seen
the
record
in
this
case,
the
latter
half
of
which
--
is
in
--
involves
the
11
exhibits
which
we
introduced
in
support
of
the
virginia
reapportionment
system.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
the
exclusion
of
the
military
personnel
in
those
cases
substantially
reduces
the
population-variance
ratios
but
they
would
be
as
is
also
true
of
a
number
of
other
metropolitan
areas,
underrepresented
on
a
straight
per
capita
basis,
viewed
only
from
the
per
capita
basis
but
the
removal
of
the
military
personnel
from
norfolk
would
leave
norfolk
not
even
underrepresented
on
a
straight
per
capita
basis.
i
should
like
to
conclude,
if
i
may,
the
opening
argument
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
by
alluding
to
two
observations
of
the
solicitor
general
in
which
we
very
definitely
concur.
the
first
of
this
is
on
page
45
of
his
compendious
brief
in
the
maryland
case
which
we
have
cited
on
page
21
of
our
reply
brief.
in
this
connection,
the
solicitor
general
uses
a
following
language,
"the
court
is
not
to
exercise
the
legislative
function
of
choosing
between
alternatives.
still
greater
deference
may
be
due
the
people
of
a
state
when
exercising
the
sovereign
function
of
shaping
their
own
governmental
institutions.
the
postulates
of
federalism
also
argue
that
in
this
area,
the
national
judiciary
must
take
care
to
allow
full
scope
for
local
self-government."
we
could
not
agree
more
but
we
suspect
that
the
solicitor
general,
despite
these
words
attempts
to
leave
virginia
very
little
room
for
local
self-government.
in
his
brief
in
this
particular
case,
the
attorney
general
has
--
the
solicitor
general
has
commented
upon
the
results
of
the
virginia
system
in
the
following
language
which
we
have
set
out
on
page
22
of
our
reply
brief.
in
this
connection,
he
says,
"the
evidence
also
show
that
measured
simply
by
the
percentage
of
population
required
to
elect
a
majority
in
each
house
of
the
legislature,
virginia
ranks
well
up
on
the
list
of
well-apportioned
states,"
and
so
virginia
does
if
your
honors
please
and
so
virginia
does.
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice,
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
will
retain
the
balance
of
their
allotted
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
to
me,
the
chief
example
mr.
justice
white
is
in
the
election
of
the
chief
executive
magistrate
of
the
state
that
is
the
government.
the
majority
can
elect
the
governor
on
a
statewide
basis
under
the
one-man
one-vote
rule
which
is
always
obtained
in
--
in
virginia
that
being
no
way
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
your
honor.
especially
is
this
true
in
a
state
where
the
governor
has
great
weight
in
the
legislative
process
as
making
reports
to
the
general
assembly
as
is
required
by
our
constitution
as
in
recommending
a
legislative
program,
as
in
preparing
the
budget,
exercising
the
veto
in
our
state
so
far
as
the
appropriations
act
is
concerned,
it
is
an
item
veto
which
is
vested
in
the
--
in
the
governor
under
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
two-thirds
of
--
that
both
house
is
present
your
honor,
the
two-thirds
both
having
necessarily
to
constitute
a
majority
of
all
votes,
of
the
full
membership.
consequently
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
to
keep
the
majority
from
controlling
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branch.
and
we
say
that
if
the
majority
is
a
large
--
if
the
minority
control
requires
a
large
minority
to
control
then
what
you
have
is
a
check
of
the
minority
and
not
a
tyranny
of
the
minority
which
would
arise
at
10%,
it
can
override
90%.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
they
are
definitely
bona
fide
issue
between
the
majority
view
and
the
minority
view
in
virginia.
of
course
so
far
as
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes
sir,
but
what
--
we
do
not
suggest
that
they
naturally
or
inevitably
fall
in
every
case
along
a
60
or
40%
basis?
these
--
these
are
theoretical
figures
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
we
--
we
feel
your
honor
that
they
very
--
definitely
have
in
view
of
the
policy
which
is
being
adopted
by
our
chief
executive
in
this
particular
area
and
in
the
past
governor's
--
during
his
tenure
of
office
in
attempting
to
aid
the
heavily
populated
areas
of
the
state
by
program
--
vast
programs
of
industrialization
and
by
the
creation
of
departments
designed
particularly
to
deal
with
urban
problems.
these
has
come
into
being
in
the
tenure
of
the
last
two
governors
as
an
indication
of
the
