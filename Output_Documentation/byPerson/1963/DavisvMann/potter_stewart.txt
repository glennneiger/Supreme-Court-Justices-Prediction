are
the
counties

well
are
the
cities
separate
from
the
counties
like
baltimore
city?
justice

and
are
not
at

governed
by

the
republican
form
of
government,
by

justice

stewart
by
a
dictionary
definition
means
representative
government.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
in
any
state
is
more
than
its
legislative
assembly
and
what
if
a
state
is
through
the
historical
working
out
of
an
equilibrium
of
political
forces
in
the
various
aspects
of
its
government
has
worked
out
a
system
where
there's
no
possibility
of
tyranny
by
anybody,
isn't
that
a
--
isn't
that
preferable,
the
tyranny
by
a
majority
or
a
minority?
justice

how
recently
have
they
done
it
in
virginia?
how
recently
have
they
reapportioned
your
legislature?
justice

in
which
year
it?
then
you're
actively

six

justice

(inaudible)
and
it's
been
done
every
10
years,
after
each
--
after
each
census.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand.
but
is
it
--
it
--
affirmative
action
actually
has
been
taken.
they
haven't
in
any
--
in
at
any
time
just
said
we'll
just
stick
with
the
same
section
we've
had

justice

what's
a

what's
a
green
button?
is
that
a
yes
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
i
see
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
your
--
i
appreciate
your
argument.
the
virginia
case
but
do
you
suggest
that
it
would
be
--
that
it
would
be
an
irrational
and
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
instead
of
raw
population
figures,
a
state
should
use
registered
voters
figures
or
people
over
21?
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
those
people
are
not
qualified
to
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there's
no
right
in
saying
that
that's
--
that's
a
--
that's
a
brand
new
claim
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
last
week
as
i
understood
it
from
the
phrase
per
capita
was
used
quite
frequently
but
i
think
it
was
conceded
by
everybody
who
--
who
argued
the
favor
of
that
per
capita
rule
that
it
could
equally
name
registered
voters
or
people
over
21
years
old.
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
you
say,
then
let
--
let's
assume
a
district
which
for
one
reason
or
another,
all
the
families
there
had
lots
of
children
and
they
were
--
1000
people
but
800
of
them
were
children,
there
are
only
200
voters
and
you
think
a
--
a
district
like
that
under
the
constitution,
would
be
required
to
have
--
of
those
200
voters
exactly
the
same
representation
with
tiny
variations
in
the
legislature
as
--
as
1000
voters
within
the
next
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you're
not
saying
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
there
could
have
been
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
state
court
action
in
new
york
for
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
couldn't
it?
