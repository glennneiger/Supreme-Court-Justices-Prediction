justice

white
and
he
just
isn't
filling
orders
that
the
people
he
bought
the
sugar
from
had.
justice
byron

white
but
isn't
a
private
carriage
that
isn't
engaged
in
bona
fide
private
carriage?
what
is
this?
it
may
--
the
act
may
say
he
can't
do
it
but
he
isn't
a
contract
carrier
of
sugar.
he
isn't
a
common
carrier
of
sugar.
justice
byron

white
for
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
whom?
who
hired
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
203
(c)
just
says
that
--
it
says
you're
not
supposed
to
do
this.
it
didn't
say
what
he
was,
still
doesn't
say
who
hired
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
still
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
still
in
the
cases,
what
it's
prohibiting
is
for-hire
carriage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
is
the
for-hire
carriage
in
this
case?
who
hired
him
and
who
paid
him
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
still
isn't
a
--
you
--
you
must
concede
he
is
not
--
he
isn't
--
he
is
not
hiring
--
nobody
paid
him
anything,
nobody
hired
him,
you
concede
to
all
the
facts
referred
to
it
which
would
eliminate
--
which
would
--
all
of
things
you
concede
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
his
having
been
hired.
you
must
say
that
--
that
what
congress
did
is
just
--
it
did
create
a
no
man's
land,
it
just
said,
"the
people
can't
do
this."
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was
--
he
was
--
really
wasn't
neither,
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
excuse
me
brother.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
it
--
under
this
last
clauses,
under
the
crucial
clause,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he's
in
for-hire
transportation
or
not.
congress
just
says,
nor
shall
any
--
other
person
engaged
in
this
kind
of
transportation
that
that
--
that
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
would
that
--
he
may
not
be
able
to
get
a
--
this
is
just
the
kind
of
transportations
nobody
so
engaged
in
whether
he's
for-hire
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
if
he
hadn't
been
in
the
--
engaged
in
the
livestock
business
at
all
that
he
would
be
in
trouble
here
for
transporting
property
for-hire?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
he
might
be
--
he
might
be
hauling
--
you're
just
saying
that
what
--
what
was
--
what
he
was
really
doing
was
hauling
for-hire
for
his
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
--
that
doesn't
depended
at
all
on
putting
in
the
livestock
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
you
put
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
depend
on
203
(c).
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
here
does
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
set
this
out
more
fully.
i
would
like
to
save
just
a
few
minutes
for
reply
argument.
we
have
set
these
--
our
arguments
out
more
fully
in
our
briefs
but
as
--
as
a
general
position,
we
stated
that
in
an
answer
to
your
last
question,
yes,
that
transfer
--
that
transaction
is
forbidden
by
250,
1958
amendment.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
what
is
sugar
used
for
in
the
feed
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
other
items
didn't
have
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
sugar
was.
sugar
was
and
it
wasn't
involved
in
the
feed
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
sold
it
--
you
sold
it
to
dealers
of
sugar.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
question
was
what
if
sugar
was
connected
with
either
one
of
your
other
primary
businesses
and
they
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
livestock
business
or
the
feed
business,
sugar
wasn't
related
to
either
one
of
them,
they
have
still
made
their
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
you
have
to
--
the
--
the
commission
found
against
you
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
mean
you
have
to
upset
some
findings
of
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
trouble
with
that
is
that
the
sugar
merchant
--
the
other
sugar
merchant
had
already
paid
his
--
the
--
the
transportation
is
already
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
35
cents
--
your
35
cents
--
you
made
35
cents
over
the
price
--
price
you
paid
to
louisiana,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
leaves
--
is
that
accounted
for
what
it
cost
you
to
bring
the
sugar
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for-hire,
for-hire.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
in
fact
you're
a
for-hire
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wolff
what
would
have
happen
to
your
livestock
business
if
you
hadn't
had
this
backhaul
business?
i
suppose
the
livestock
business
would
have
been
either
less
profitable
or
you'd
had
to
raise
your
prices,
you'd
have
less
business.
i
mean
there's
a
--
certainly
there's
an
interrelationship
between
livestock
and
sugar
in
the
sense
that
--
in
--
in
the
sense
that
if
you'd
had
to
bring
these
trucks
back
empty,
you're
going
to
have
to
take
less
profit
on
your
--
on
your
livestock
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
you
would
argue
that
there
was
a
--
and
that
that
there's
a
--
there's
a
--
certainly,
a
supporting
role
of
what
--
to
that
hauling
a
sugar
performs
for
the
livestock
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
noticed
that
the
house
committee's
report
was
headed
up
pseudo
carriage,
like
pseudo
carriage
for
hire,
is
this
(inaudible)
you
submitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
pseudo,
(inaudible).
