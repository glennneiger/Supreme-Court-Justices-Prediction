justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
he
have
orders
for
the
sugar
before
he
deposit
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
from
the
markup
over
(inaudible)
unless
he
sell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
authorize
that
market.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
--
i
was
wondering
how
--
what
he
sells
for
sells
with
the
going
market.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
a
going
market.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
ginnane,
i
gather
you'd
had
a
long
history
of
developing
the
primary
business
test
in
commission
decisions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
am
i
correct
in
reading
those
as
in
effect
saying
that
if
you
don't
satisfy
the
--
in
the
circumstances
like
this,
the
primary
business
test,
then
that
establishes
that
you're
in
for-hire
transportation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
without
giving
for-hire
transportation
any
other
special
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
as
--
as
i
understood
it,
when
a
private
carrier
--
this
is
neither
contact
or
common
carrier
of
course,
that
when
a
private
carrier
which
is
what
this
test
was,
did
this
kind
of
thing
and
what
he
hold
was
not
in
his
primary
business.
then
that
automatically
established
it
factually
as
a
for-hire
transportation,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean,
would
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
mathews,
is
it
as
simple
as
this,
speaking
only
of
the
1958
amendment.
apparently,
the
first
element
is
that
the
person
involved
must
not
be
involve
--
engaged
in
the
transportation
business.
he
must
be
engaged
in
some
business
but
not
in
transportation
business.
that's
the
first
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
requirement
is
that
he
can't
hold
on
anything
for
a
business
purpose
for
any
business
purpose
unless
that
business
purpose
is
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
in
which
he's
engaged,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
make
him
a
--
that
doesn't
put
him
in
the
transportation
business.
it
merely
says
that
as
i
read
it,
if
he's
in
some
business
other
than
transportation
and
he
holds
something
for
a
business
purpose,
that
which
he
holds
must
be
for
a
primary
business
purpose
of
his
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
other
than
trans
--
that
doesn't
put
him
in
the
transportation
business.
this
fellow
is
not
in
the
transportation
business,
is
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
that
(voice
overlap)
feed
business
of
the
live
--
livestock
business,
that
you're
in
a
general
mercantile
business
and
that
is
your
primary
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
that
happens
to
include
among
other
things
that
sugar
and
salt
as
well
as
grain
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
you
would
say
that
within
this
1958
amendment,
you
don't
have
any
primary
business,
you'd
have
only
a
single
primary
business
enterprise
namely
a
general
mer
--
mercantile
business
enterprise
and
if
this
hauling
of
sugar
was
incident
to
that
single
primary
business
of
general
mercantile,
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
the
three-judge
court
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wolff,
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
question
before
you
do
that,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
a
moment
or
so
ago
or
suggest
when
you
asked
us
to
do
--
listen
to
you
with
what
followed
what
mr.
ginnane
had
read
from
the
legislative
history.
he
said
--
suggested
something
that
--
about
prearrangement,
do
you
read
the
1958
amendment
as
proscribing
only
that
kind
of
thing
which,
in
effect,
would
be
a
prearrangement
between
your
client
and
the
purchasers
of
the
sugar,
in
effect,
by
this
device
to
act
as
carrier
for
them
of
this
sugar
with
(inaudible)
consignees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
the
essential
thing
has
to
be
that
in
--
in
actual
facts,
you're
doing
something
in
the
way
of
transportation
for
somebody
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
here
that
there
isn't
any
evidence,
sufficient
evidence
support
any
findings
that
in
that
sense,
there
was
any
prearrangement
between
you
and
the
ultimate
purchasers
of
the
sugar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
right
there
mr.
wolff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
gets
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
before.
if
you
interpret
the
1958
amendment
as
saying
a
private
carrier
can't
do
this.
you
might
be
in
trouble
but
if
you
interpret
the
1958
amendment
as
saying,
a
private
carrier,
who
went
on
a
particular
transaction
is
not
in
fact
so
--
to
use
my
own
words
from
--
from
drum,
although
i
don't
know
where
i
got
it,
or
i
got
it
from
the
legislative
history,
not
a
pseudo
private
carrier,
meaning
thereby
that
you're
not
in
fact
a
private
carrier
but
you're
really
one
for-hire.
if
it
works
that
way
then
i
gather
you
say
on
this
record,
you're
free
and
clear.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
--
if
this
--
if
this
is
a
prohibition
against
the
bona
fide
private
carrier
doing
precisely
this,
if
that's
what
the
1958
amendment
is,
then
aren't
you
in
trouble?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
--
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
is
a
prohibition
against
a
bona
fide
private
carrier
doing
something,
that's
one
thing.
when
there's
--
there's
a
prohibition
only
when
the
private
carrier
accessed
a
pseudo-private
carrier
and
is
actually
acting
as
a
contract
for-hire
that
might
--
what
might
bring
about
a
very
different
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly,
that
wasn't
transportation
to
what
suggests
being
a
fully
private
carrier,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mostly,
you're
only
permitted.
