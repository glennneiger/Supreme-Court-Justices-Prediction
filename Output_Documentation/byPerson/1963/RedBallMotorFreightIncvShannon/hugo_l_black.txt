i
do
not
quite
understand
(inaudible),
suppose
a
new
york
fruit
broker
decide
that
he
wanted
to
buy
his
fruits
in
florida,
he
gets
trucks,
cars,
and
those
in
florida
buys
it.
he
comes
back
to
new

and
sell
it.
what
would
he
be?
that's
all
that
he's
been,
buying
and
selling
oranges.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
--
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
his
whole
business
and
he
has
no
capacity,
he
just
sells
it,
buys
it,
puts
it
in
his
truck,
comes
to
washington
and
new

and
there
sells
it
from
his
trucks,
that's
his
business.
justice

black
(voice

--
didn't
he
use
their
own
trucks
by
203
(c)?
as
a
man
who
wants
to
engage
in
a
business
of
that
kind,
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
this
extent
of
the
argument.
a
man
who
wants
to
engage
in
the
business
of
that
kind,
they
used
to
do
it
a
good
deal,
go
from
one
place
to
another
and
buy
stuff,
take
it
to
another
place
and
sell
it.
is
he
violating
203
(c)?
justice

l.

a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
let
--
let's
say
that's
his
own
haul
then,
if
he
could
make
a
little
(inaudible)
certainly,
some
people
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
couldn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
makes
his
living
wholly
out
of
that?
that
he
makes
his
living
by
selling
this
at
a
profit
that
in
order
to
sell
it
easier
to
get
more
profit,
he
holds
it
for
himself,
is
that
forbidden
by
203
(c)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
and
those
are
words
i
don't
quite
understand.
that's
what
the
wording
is.
if
his
whole
business,
he
engages
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
oranges
or
something
else
and
he
utilize
that
a
part
of
the
business,
the
fact
that
he
could
make
a
better
profit
by
going
and
getting
and
bring
it
back
to
somewhere.
and
do
--
and
do
i
understand
that
this
203
(c)
makes
that
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
unless
it's
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
assuming
here
that
he
makes
his
living
by
the
profit
he
makes
out
of
the
fruit
he
buys
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
he
sold
and
effort
to
sell
--
selling
buy
and
sell
a
commodity
and
--
and
he
make
no
profit
out
of
it
by
buying
it
from
one
place
selling
--
moving
it
to
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
--
maybe
i
--
maybe
i
have
misunderstood.
i
--
i
gather
now
that
what
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
my
mythical
man,
although
the
(inaudible)
buys
it,
goes
in
and
buys
it,
sells
it.
but
after
he
sells
it,
he
doesn't
take
anything
back
on
a
backhaul
when
he
goes
to
buy
more
oranges,
then
that's
forbidden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
all
depends
on
whether
the
man
who's
into
--
been,
unless
he's
doing
in
that
way,
carries
stuff
on
the
backhaul
after
he's
really,
legitimately
and
even
if
he's
illegit
--
legitimately
engaged
in
the
other
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
--
that
is
your
point,
of
doing
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
reply
brief,
as
i
think
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
in
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
4
and
5.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
have
to
if
that's
correct?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
that's
a
sham.
it's
really
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he's
really
a
carrying
goods
for-hire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
he's
not
really
engaged
in
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
it
aimed
at
--
before
his
primary
--
his
bona
fide,
what
you
call
entrepreneur
engaged
in
a
small
business,
discovering
that
he
can
buy
and
sell
sugar
for
profits
and
that
he
can
make
more
profit
if
he
carries
it
for
himself,
bona
fide,
no
shams,
would
you
say
he's
forbidden
by
law
to
do
it,
by
208
(c)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
because
it's
a
sham?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not.
you
admit
then
that
he's
a
bona
fide
broker?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
he
a
sham?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
sham?
justice

i'm
not
talking

and
its

of,
i've
known

yet
over
50
years
ago
and
people

they

and
do
something
and
then
buy
something
at
a
profit
and
bring
it
back
and
sell
it,
buy
something
and
make
it
--
sell
it
for
profit
and
bring
it
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
make
him
--
is
that
what's
intended
to
be
covered
here?
maybe
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
man
i'm
talking
about
wasn't
engaged
in
transportation,
he
was
a
merchant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
his
own
vehicle.
he
used
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
the
language
be
cleared,
did
your
association
have
this
--
get
--
urged
this
to
be
passed
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
well,
why
didn't
they
put
a
language
that
had
fit
it
better,
so
we
wouldn't
be
troubled
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
intended
to
make
it
illegal?
maybe
it
is.
it's
quite
a
waste
but
maybe
it
is.
congress
has
the
right
to
do
it
if
he
intended
to
make
it
illegal
for
a
man
who
sees
when
he's
--
has
something,
he's
at
a
place
where
the
truck
doing
his
own
business
for
him
to
go
in
an
additional
business
of
buying
something
and
selling
it
when
he
gets
back
in
order
to
make
an
additional
profit,
is
that
what
you're
saying
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
precisely,
your
honor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that
--
if
that's
right,
then
it
undoubtedly,
you're
--
you're
correct.
but
it
seems
to
me
like
they
use
very
inept
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
phrased
in
general
language,
and
that
it
has
been
left
to
the
commission
to
deal
case
by
case
with
situations
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
--
in
some
language
they
had
authorized
him
to
do
something
in
a
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
they
had
shown
--
you
had
to
agree
with
its
own
that
your
claiming
to
be
in
the
mercantile
business
as
a
local
--
local
(inaudible)
but
in
reality,
a
sham
and
you're
utilizing
--
practically
as
running
a
transportation
business
and
making
your
profit
by
altogether
out
of
the
fact
that
you
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
they
pay
you
what
your
transportations
were.
what
would
you
say
if
they
had
those
facts
and
those
were
the
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
that
if
it
is
a
sham
--
if
it's
a
sham,
if
they
found
it
and
found
on
certain
facts,
then
you
would
be
covered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
they
did
intend
to
put
a
man
out
of
business
because
he
--
he
was
buying
and
selling
different
things
simply
because
he
transported
them
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
deny
that
the
act
of
your
--
guilt
in
violation
of
this
depends
on
how
much
you
bought
and
sold
of
one
product
and
how
much
you
bought
and
sold
of
another.
as
justice
brennan
said,
if
your
primary
business
was
to
buy
and
sell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
--
do
these
figures
show
that
you
got
a
--
made
it
private
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
efforts
in
the
--
was
there
any
effort
to
show
that
the
profit
you
made
was
amounted
in
--
in
the
long
run
or
any
other
time
to
the
equivalent
only
of
the
--
what
it
cost
to
transport
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
not
only
claimed
he's
been
a
merchant,
but
was
successful
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
however
as
i
understand
it
that
if
they
had
shown,
made
findings
on
the
facts
substantial
evidence
that
in
reality,
the
profits
you
made
was
the
equivalent
only
of
the
--
what
the
regular
transporters
got
then
they
would
have
the
case
against
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
i'm
talking
about
if
they
found
on
substantial
facts
that
that
was
it,
that
you're
really
just
making
money
out
of
transportation
rather
than
buying
and
selling
and
stuff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
beforehand,
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
--
and
the
statute
says
what
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
any
statute
that
substitutes
the
words
he
substituted.
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
here
desired
to
make
it
unlawful
for
men
to
engage
in
a
general
mercantile
business,
by
saying,
"well,
we're
going
to
pick
out
one
of
them,
if
you
engage
in
two
--
since
we're
engaged
in
buying
two
or
three
things,
then
you
will
execute
your
primary
business
as
the
one
we
select
and
you'll
be
a
criminal."
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.

on
that
issue
--
on
that
issue,
what
app
--
what
application
do
you
think
that
universal
camera
ruled
last
year
into
this
--
what
the
courts
got
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall,
i'm
--
i
maybe
--
maybe
wrong,
universal
camera
case
indicated
that
we
were
compelled
now
to
give
more
weight
to
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
judge
to
whom
these
cases
had
been
somewhat
turned
over
to
decide.
and
we
previously
had
because
we
had
been
simply
saying
that
if
there's
a
dispute
in
the
evidence,
that
entry
but
as
i
recall
it
in
the
universal
camera,
we
said
that
was
no
longer
the
rule
because
congress
had
said
that
we
should
not
follow
such
a
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
name
do
they
do
business?
i
haven't
seen
that.
justice
hugo

where
was
his
home
place
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
san
antonio,
texas.
justice
hugo

black
do
you
say
that
the
determination
of
whether
you
are
--
or
saying
in
your
private
or
primary
business
does
not
depend
on
the
commodities
you
carry
measuring
between
them
to
see
which
one
you
can
carry
the
most
of,
but
depends
on
whether
or
not
your
primary
business
is
buying
and
selling
commodities
out
of
which
you
can
make
a
profit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
you
would
carry
90%
of
wheat
and
other
things
that
you
can
buy
10%.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
say
is
that
you
would
be
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
for
a
profit
and
you
wouldn't
--
your
primary
business
wouldn't
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
you
carried
more
wheat
than
anything
else
--
that
you
bought
more
wheat
than
anything
else.
justice

you've

excuse

excuse
me.
(inaudible)
justice

may
i
ask
you
if

if
there
have
been
efforts
made
since
the

first

passed
to
require
people

share

have
the

what

you
think
was
meant
by
the
heading
of
the
house
report
"pseudo-private

justice

in
other
words,
it
can.
justice
hugo

well,
that's
the
impression
you've
been
exposing
part
of
the
brief
of
the
association
here,
pseudo
carriers,
pseudo
carriers
was
unlawful,
pseudo
carriers,
that's
the
closing
paragraph

i
recall
it
of
their
brief.
