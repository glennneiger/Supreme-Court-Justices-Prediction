mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
--
in
the
brief
time
we
have
remaining,
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
a
--
expand
the
facts
a
little
bit
discussing
a
--
in
a
little
more
detail
as
applied
to
this
case,
because
--
because
after
all,
it
was
the
facts
of
this
case
upon
which
the
commission's
order
is
based.
and
while
numerous
variations
can
be
--
could
be
considered,
as
the
commission
remarked
in
its
report,
each
one
of
these
transactions
will
have
to
be
determined
upon
its
own
particular
facts
under
the
1958
amendment
to
section
203
(c).
now,
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
set
out
in
convenient
form
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
reply
brief
in
406.
it
this
--
this
colored
document,
on
pages
4
and
5,
we
have
set
out
exhibit
1.
the
reason
i
particularly
refer
to
that
is
because
i
believe
the
--
it's
a
little
bit
easier
to
refer
to
than
the
exhibit
as
it
is
in
the
record
because
in
the
record,
the
parts
of
the
exhibit
are
printed
on
opposite
sides
of
the
same
sheet
and
a
little
bit
difficult
to
follow.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
4
and
5.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
now
--
oh,
i
shouldn't
say
that
we
have
added
to
the
exhibit.
the
only
change
we
have
made
in
the
exhibit
is
to
add
column
13.
column
13
is
an
arithmetical
computation
by
which
we
derive
the
number
of
100-pound
bags
of
sugar
on
each
load.
so
by
reading
column
13
on
page
5,
you
can
determine
the
amount
of
load
in
each
of
the
shipments.
now,
exhibit
1,
the
record
shows,
is
a
representation
of
shannon's,
the
appellees'
principal
sugar
receivers.
it
is
not
exclusive
but
these
are
the
principal
receivers
and
this
is
a
representative
showing
of
the
sugar
--
proscribed
sugar
transactions
over
a
period
of
three
months.
this
shows
a
number
of
things
but
i
think
the
most
important
is
this.
if
you
scan
this
exhibit
1,
it
shows
a
very
--
i
think
the
word
remarkable
is
a
fair
word,
remarkable
sequence
in
that
--
in
these
representative
transactions.
shannon
knew
that
he
could
load
a
truck
at
supreme,
louisiana,
525
miles
away
from
san
antonio
with
something
between
31,000
and
37,500
pounds
of
sugar
in
100-pound
sacks
and
carry
it
to
san
antonio
and
there
deliver
it
to
the
receivers
of
the
sugar
and
be
paid
for
it.
that
shows
a
complete
understanding
between
shannon
and
the
receivers
of
the
sugar
that
shannon
could
perform
a
purely
transportation
operation
on
the
backhaul,
contribute
nothing
whatsoever
to
the
sugar
but
as
the
economist
would
phrase
it,
a
change
of
place,
utility
and
do
it
regularly
and
smoothly,
and
methodically
over
a
period
of
months
to
basically
the
same
customers.
now,
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
repetition
of
the
same
customers.
lawlor
seven
loads
and
norton
(ph),
five,
barks
(ph),
three.
now,
what
was
shannon
contributing
to
that
movement?
shannon
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
if
he
hadn't
been
engaged
in
the
livestock
business
at
all,
he
wouldn't
be
hauling
sugar
back
because
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh
no,
no.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
the
livestock
business
is
incident
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh
yes,
indeed.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
--
the
phrasing
was
this."
whether
or
not
we
consider
the
1958
amendment,
shannon
is
engaged
in
transportation
for-hire."
the
--
the
commission
found
that
either
under
the
--
the
so-called
primary
business
test
of
the
lenoir
chair
case
or
under
203
(c),
under
the
1958
amendment.
shannon
was
engaged
in
transportation
for-hire
but
our
point
is
that
you
don't
need
to
go
back
to
the
primary
business
test
of
lenoir
chair
case
that
preceded
the
1958
amendment.
you
can
rely
only
on
the
1958
amendment
because
the
1958
amendment
to
use
a
--
a
shorthand
phrase
nailed
it
down.
the
1958
amendment
was
clearly
directed
at
precisely
this
sort
of
thing.
and
so
you
don't
need
to
go
back
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
he
is
forbidden
by
law
to
do
it
in
the
way
it
is
done
here.
here
--
here
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
no.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir.
i
--
i
think
if
we
use
--
if
we
use
those
all
inclusive
phrases
--
phrases
that
whether
he's
a
sham
or
whether
he's
a
broker.
well,
in
the
first
place,
he
isn't
a
broker.
well,
to
clear
up
one
thing,
he
could
not
be
a
broker
of
transportation
without
a
permit
to
be
a
broker
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
under
interstate
commerce
act.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
getting
at
--
getting
at
the
--
getting
at
broker
of
sugar,
he
is
not
a
broker
of
sugar
because
there
is
--
he
--
he
handles
sugar
in
no
other
way.
in
other
words,
a
broker
sits
in
an
office
and
sells
sugar
over
the
telephone
or
buy
perhaps
by
personal
calls.
but
here's
what
happens
with
shannon.
he
sends
a
load
of
livestock
or
some
other
materials
in
which
he
needs,
prepared
feed
or
that
sort
of
thing
to
southern
louisiana.
and
not
every
time
--
he
doesn't
do
this
every
time
but
on
the
occasions
because
some
other
time
he
brings
back
grain
and
feed
and
things
like
that
in
his
own
trucks
that
have
carried
the
outbound
load.
but
when
he
finds
himself
with
an
empty
truck
more
than
500
miles
away
from
san
antonio,
it
is
then
he
goes
around
to
the
refinery
and
buys
the
sugar
and
one
or
two
days
later,
sells
that
in
san
antonio.
and
we
say,
and
the
committees
of
congress
said
in
reporting
and
recommending
the
1958
amendment
of
203
(c)
for
passage
said
that
that
kind
of
thing
is
a
transportation
business.
now,
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
that
shannon
was
in
two
kinds
of
business.
he
was
in
a
warehousing
business
at
san
antonio
where
he
handles
feed,
and
salt,
and
livestock
and
a
--
some
--
had
it
maintained
a
very
small
inventory
of
sugar
that
mr.
ginnane
referred
to,
that
is
one
business.
then
the
commission
found
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
transportation
business
in
the
backhaul,
in
bringing
the
sugar
back
because
this
sugar
that
is
represented
in
exhibit
1
does
not
stop
at
the
warehouse.
in
fact,
on
the
only
identifiable
occasion
in
the
record,
when
one
of
the
receivers
of
the
sugar
for
some
reason
that
is
not
revealed,
refused
to
take
it,
one
of
the
person
he
thought
was
going
to
take
it
didn't
take
it.
shannon
did
not
have
enough
room
in
the
warehouse
to
store
the
sugar
so
he
had
to
put
it
in
a
public
warehouse.
in
other
words,
his
business,
his
--
his
primary
business
in
san
antonio
is
not
adapted
to
handling
truck
load
sugar.
he
had
to
put
it
in
a
public
warehouse
and
his
testimony
is
in
the
record
that
he
simply
couldn't
make
any
money
that
way
on
this
transaction
because
of
the
loading
and
unloading
charges
and
the
public
warehouse
cost.
the
--
the
charges
he
had
to
pay
for
public
warehousing.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
sugar
transportation
from
--
by
truck
load
from
louisiana
to
san
antonio
is
a
pure
transportation
business.
it's
a
separate
business
the
commission
found
on
the
facts
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
buy
and
sell
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
it
is.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
i
might
--
i
might
remind
you
of
this,
that
50
years
ago,
anybody
could
go
out
and
buy
a
truck
and
engage
in
transportation
for-hire.
but
that
was
ended
in
1935.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
alright
and
in
the
1958
amendment
to
section
203
(c),
congress
has
said
in
the
reports
of
the
committee
make
it
entirely
clear
that
that
was
their
purpose
and
the
language
is
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
transportation
association
of
america
whom
i
do
not
represent
urged
that
it'd
be
enacted
for
this
purpose.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
if
you
--
if
you
read
it
--
if
you
read
the
--
the
--
they're
the
language
that's
in
parenthesis,
no
person
shall
engage
in
transportation
in
a
--
in
a
business
other
than
transportation
--
in
--
the
--
the
business
to
be
exempt,
must
be
a
business
other
than
transportation.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
other
than
that
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
other
than
transportation.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
he
is
when
he
--
he
is
when
he
takes
a
truck
under
the
1958
amendment.
he
is
when
he
takes
an
empty
truck
and
picks
up
a
load
of
sugar.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
if
the
court
please.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
want
to
catch
on
just
three
or
four
points.
one
of
them
is
to
haul
particular
attention
to
the
church
point
wholesale
beverage
case
that
is
cited
in
our
--
all
of
our
briefs.
that
case
analyzes
the
legislative
history
and
gives
a
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
and
it
points
out
very
clear
analysis
that
if
the
statute
of
the
1958
amendment
is
not
given
the
application
that
the
commission
and
the
other
appellants
here
contend
for,
that
there
will
be
a
very
serious
breakdown
in
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
and
it
explains
why,
because
of
the
device
of
buy
and
sell.
and
it
also
points
out
that
it
present
possible
breakdown
in
the
enforcement
of
the
motor
carrier
act
toward
which
the
--
which
the
1958
was
directed.
now,
i
want
to
also
mention
briefly
that
we
do
not
believe
the
universal
camera
case
is
applicable
here
because
here
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
facts.
i
mean
the
facts
are
--
there's
no
--
the
--
they
are
just
a
certain
set
of
facts
that
are
not
disputed
and
--
and
there's
no
--
the
only
inferences
are
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts.
now,
if
you
will
examine
exhibit
1
which
as
i
say
was
reproduced
in
pages
4
and
5
of
our
reply
brief
and
omits
the
last
line
which
is
a
transfer
--
which
is
a
load
to
laredo
cases
all
of
the
rest
are
san
antonio
and
compute
the
average
return
or
profits
so-called
for
100
pounds
of
sugar,
it
figures
to
42
cents.
the
evidence
of
a
--
an
expert
witness
is
that
the
average
profit
in
sugar
in
san
antonio
at
that
time
was
25
cents
to
35
cents.
the
carload
rail
rate
at
that
time
was
69
cents
so
the
profit
realized
by
shannon
from
each
--
from
average
profit
was
about
midway
between
what
wholesale
dealers
were
making
and
what
the
freight
rate
was.
in
other
words,
he
was
rendering
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost.
now,
there's
been
some
--
been
some
exchange
of
questions
about
whether
there
was
an
understanding
between
shannon
and
the
receivers
of
the
sugar.
it
seems
perfectly
clear
that
there
must
have
been
a
clear
understanding
that
the
receivers
would
accept
the
sugar
when
it
arrived
in
san
antonio
that
is
exhibit
--
that
is
shown
by
exhibit
1
because
exhibit
1
shows
a
very
successful
enterprise.
purchase
of
sugar,
and
delivery,
and
every
transaction
was
a
profit.
so
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
--
it
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
could
--
it
could
indeed
show
a
ready
market,
but
it
--
if
--
but
if
--
if
it
does
show
--
it
just
show
a
--
a
de
facto
of
a
very
successful
operation
in
the
transportation.
now,
reference
was
also
--
some
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
amendment
of
1958
applies.
we
cite
the
ziffrin
case,
ziffrin
against
united
states
in
our
briefs
and
it
seems
very
clear
to
us
that
the
--
under
the
clear
holding
of
that
case,
the
1958
amendment
does
apply.
i
also
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
point
that
is
readily
apparent
in
the
briefs
that
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellee
were
decided
before
the
1958
amendment.
now,
the
legislative
history
or
the
--
or
the
--
the
excerpts
from
the
committee
reports
are
--
are
attached
to
the
commission's
report.
of
course,
they're
readily
available
but
a
scanning
of
those
will
make
it
evident
that
pseudo
--
so-called
"pseudo-private"
carriage
was
not
the
only
target
of
the
1958
amendment.
it
is
perfectly
clear
--
i
--
i
don't
have
--
certainly
don't
have
time
to
go
into
that,
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
were
three
things
at
which
the
amendment
was
aimed
and
a
straight
forward
buy
and
sell
arrangement
was
proscribed
as
here.
thank
you.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
that's
just
a
--
an
error
in
somebody's
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
the
--
i
--
i
think
it's
a
very
fair
statement
to
say
that
the
amendment
was
aimed
at
buy
and
sells,
straight
forward
as
here.
it
was
aimed
at
pseudo
carriage
also.
