mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellees
understand
the
problems
of
the
appellant
carriers
in
this
case.
they
are
regulated
and
argued
to
protect
all
of
their
rights
which
is
certainly
what
they
should
do.
however,
the
appellees
believe
that
the
small
businessman
should
not
be
made
to
sacrifice
any
of
his
rights
just
because
or
that
the
--
there
should
be
any
further
granting
of
rights
to
the
appellant
carriers
by
taking
them
away
from
the
small
businessman.
the
appellees
believe
that
they
are
in
a
general
mercantile
business
and
that
certainly,
they
should
be
allowed
and
able
to
buy
and
sell
their
own
products,
transport
those
products
in
their
own
trucks
and
cannot
imagine
that
congress
would
have
intended
otherwise.
a
very
important
case,
as
far
as
the
appellees
are
concerned
in
this
particular
field
is
the
taylor
versus
interstate
commerce
commission
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
in
that
particular
case,
a
carrier
bought
some
lumber,
finished
lumber
in
one
state
and
transported
it
to
retailers
in
another
state.
the
retailers
purchased
an
fov
of
that
particular
state.
they
didn't
know
where
the
lumber
came
from,
who
owned
it.
the
carriers
actually
purchased
the
lumber
under
preexisting
contracts.
in
other
words,
they
wouldn't
go
out
and
buy
the
lumber
until
they
had
a
sale
for
it.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
carriage
was
private.
but
the
reason
that
i
mentioned
that
particular
case
at
this
particular
time
is
that
the
court
discussed
the
congressional
intention
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
the
transportation
act
in
that
particular
case.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
case
argued
that
it
was
a
policy
of
congress
to
require
a
liberal
interpretation
of
the
act
in
favor
of
holding
taylor
to
be
a
contract
carrier
as
opposed
to
a
private
carrier.
the
court
says
that
the
word
liberal
in
that
connection
was
--
and
the
word
it
used
was
a
weasel
word.
that
the
court
then
quoted
from
the
policy
of
the
act
that
it
was
the
national
transportation
policy
to
provide
impartial
regulation
of
all
modes
of
transportation
to
protect
and
to
serve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each.
and
one
of
those
modes
of
transportation
that
congress
evidently
felt
had
inherent
advantages
is
private
carriage
and
that
there
should
be
no
rule
of
interpretation
more
liberal
for
contract
or
common
carriage
on
the
one
hand
as
for
private
carriage.
the
court
even
mentioned
that
the
congress
has
always
desired
to
protect
the
smaller
businessmen
and
for
that
purpose
has
even
set
up
committees
to
study
legislation
therein.
so
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
private
carriage
deserves
at
least
as
much
protection
by
the
courts
as
other
forms
of
transportation,
what
are
the
particular
facts
in
this
case?
the
record
clearly
shows
that
as
a
result
of
the
routine
investigation,
the
hearing
was
held
and
ordered
and
the
facts
disclosed
that
the
appellees
were
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
many
products,
livestock
in
the
feed
mill
business.
they
bought
and
sold
corn,
oats,
wheat,
bran,
molasses,
sugar,
salt,
fertilizers
and
everything
in
the
feed
line.
it
didn't
say
everything
else
in
the
feed
line
but
everything
in
the
feed
line
so
that
we
quarrel
that
the
attempted
division
of
everything
else
in
one
category
such
as
feed
and
sugar,
separate
in
apart
in
another
category
because
it
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
it
is
not.
however,
there
is
--
under
the
testimony,
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
other
of
these
items
are
necessarily
used
in
the
feed
line.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no
sir,
however,
the
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
however,
in
the
argument
of
the
appellants,
they
attempt
to
show
that
we
have
one
mercantile
business
on
the
one
hand
which
is
only
feed
and
related
products
and
that
sugar
in
an
entirely
different
type
of
business
on
the
other
hand
so
that
we're
not
really
in
a
general
mercantile
business
of
all
the
products
but
only
a
general
mercantile
business
of
all
but
sugar
which
is
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
to
--
proceeding
along
that
line,
actually,
insofar
as
many
other
products
are
concerned
for
example
salt,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
salt
a
--
that
particular
salt
involved
had
anything
to
do
with
feed.
however,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
--
the
appellees
have
been
hauling
salt
exactly
the
same
way
that
they
were
hauling
sugar.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
and
further
that
the
--
for
example
salt
which
is
not
in
the
record
shown
to
--
to
be
the
particular
type
of
salt
that's
used
in
feed,
the
--
they
purchased
prior
to
pur
--
purchasing
sugar
and
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
--
in
the
record,
the
salt
in
the
same
manner
as
a
purchased
sugar
without
any
question.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
--
but
however,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
eventually
no
substantial
evidence
upon
which
to
base
the
findings
that
the
commission
made
concerning
the
fact
that
we
are
not
private
carriers.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
the
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
the
entire
point
of
the
whole
case.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
sham
or
a
subterfuge
or
whether
or
not
we
are
a
bona
fide
a
--
a
merchant.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
i
believe
that
is
what
the
--
the
congressional
amendment
meant
and
in
--
at
a
later
point,
i'll
discuss
some
of
the
congressional
hearings
that
were
attached
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
report
concerning
the
intention
of
the
act.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir
but
that
--
it's
necessary
to
show
that
there
are
some
sort
of
prearranged
plans,
some
sort
of
sham,
prearranged
plans
to
--
between
the
--
the
transporter
and
the
ultimate
purchaser,
so
to
enable
that
purchaser
to
receive
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost,
and
that
is
the
exact
language
that
the
committee
--
the
congressional
committee
has
used
when
the
--
they
were
discussing
the
passage
in
the
amendment
of
--
of
the
acts
pertaining
to
section
203
(c).
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
we
also
believe
that
the
evidence
shows
that
we
do
a
considerable
sugar
business
in
comparison
with
other
businesses,
is
not
a
large
concern
but
the
--
if
sugar
operations
are
on
a
parity
with
their
other
operations.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
showed
--
we
made
a
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
we
showed
that
what
the
going
market
profit
was
in
san
antonio
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
for
a
sugar
merchant
which
was
25
to
35
cents
per
100
pounds
and
according
to
the
exhibit
which
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
own
selection
of
what
they
consider
representative
sales,
it
shows
that
we
made
about
35.7400
cents
per
100
pounds
for
those
particular
sale.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
that
we
were
--
we
were
making
what
the
--
that
on
the
high
range
of
what
the
merchants,
sugar
merchants
in
the
san
antonio
area
were
making
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
of
course
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
how
other
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
that's
the
reason
we're
probably
on
the
high
side
but
there
are
certainly
other
factors
that
are
involved
such
as
bookkeeping
expense,
administrative
salaries,
unloading
cost,
loading
cost,
bad
debts,
the
risk
of
physical
loss,
the
things
of
that
nature
which
may
bring
us
down
to
the
middle
or
the
low
side
but
there
of
course,
there's
no
specific
evidence
on
that
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
i
would
say
that
would
be
an
important
factor
of
course
along
with
many
other
factors.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
if
they
found
that
our
dealings
were
really
a
--
a
sham
and
a
subterfuge
then
there
were
some
sort
of
agreements
preexisting
either
implied
or
in
fact
that
we
were
really
permitting
the
purchasers
to
receive
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost
that
that
we
would
then
be
in
violation
of
section
203
(c).
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
have
it
here.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
the
--
the
statute
certainly
does
but
the
--
the
question
is,
what
is
a
--
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise.
and
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well
the
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
of
course
all
--
all
we
have
on
it
other
than
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
the
--
or
the
hearings
before
the
committees
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
act.
and
if
i
may
quote
a
portion
of
it,
it
was
--
it
was
quoted
from
--
by
mr.
ginnane
with
a
statement,
there
is
more
but
it's
in
our
brief,
but
the
--
the
more
part
that's
in
the
brief
i
feel
is
very,
very
important
for
a
consideration
of
this
particular
fact
situation
in
--
in
the
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant
by
the
act.
this
is
from
the
house
report
and
this
is
attached
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
their
opinion
in
the
case
and
is
found
in
the
record.
in
addition,
business
which
use
their
own
trucks
to
deliver
their
own
merchandize
or
purchasing
goods
at
or
near
the
final
point
of
delivery
of
their
own
merchandize
and
transporting
such
goods
to
places
near
their
own
establishments
for
sale
to
others.
such
transportation
is
usually
performed
solely
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
compensation
for
the
otherwise
empty
return
of
their
trucks.
and
that's
where
mr.
ginnane
stopped.
now,
the
next
sentence
is,
"sometimes,
the
purchase
and
sale
is
a
bona
fide
merchandizing
venture.
in
other
instances,
prearranged
plans
are
setup
in
order
that
the
real
consignee
may
receive
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost.
so
that
i
feel
that
--
that
this
whole
case
are
--
a
major
portion
of
it
is
an
interpretation
of
what
congress
meant
in
the
passage
of
this
act,
what
do
this
language
mean
and
is
not
shannon
under
the
facts
a
--
in
the
primary
business
of
buying
and
selling
many
items
including
sugar
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
so
because
actually,
there
is
--
there's
really
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
they
did
find
but
not
based
on
substantial
evidence.
the
examiner
found
all
facts
in
favor
of
the
individual.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir,
however,
i
might
mention
this
to
the
court.
the
--
all
the
factors
that
are
involved
in
the
particular
case,
in
an
interpretation
of
203
(c)
are
mentioned
by
the
court
in
its
findings.
just
the
specific
designation
of
the
statute
is
not
mentioned
and
the
same
judge
that
passed
on
this
case,
one
of
the
three
judges
in
the
three-judge
court,
judge
brown
who
was
the
circuit
judge
on
the
court,
prior
to
that
time,
would
be
the
two
cases
were
argued
at
the
same
time
but
the
other
case
was
decided
first
which
is
the
church
point
case,
its
cited
in
the
brief,
found
for-hire
carriage
in
a
different
fact
situation
with
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
primary
business
test.
so
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
we
--
may
it
please
the
court,
we
--
the
universal
camera
case,
as
i
understand
it,
states
that
in
a
situation
where
there
a
hearing
examiner
has
--
who
has
lived
with
the
case
and
heard
the
--
the
evidence
has
made
certain
findings
that
a
commission's
finding
to
the
contrary
is
really
less
substantial.
and
further,
it
is
a
--
a
case
where
simply
because
there
is
some
evidence
or
scintilla
of
evidence
to
support
one
finding
that
that
should
be
weighed
and
considered
by
the
court
even
to
a
greater
degree
in
a
situation
where
a
hearing
examiner
who's
heard
the
evidence
and
this
is
a
fact
case
based
upon
a
factual
situation,
and
the
hearing
examiner
who
has
heard
those
facts
and
has
found
that
the
facts
were
believed
by
the
witnesses
that
--
as
they
testified
to
them
and
we
have
a
fact
situation
that
is
more
or
less
established
or
at
least,
the
court
should
give
considerable
weight
to
the
situation,
in
a
situation
where
the
question
is,
was
there
a
sham
or
a
fraud
or
a
subterfuge
insofar
as
the
facts
are
concerned.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
cited
in
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
--
the
language
that
i
--
i
just
paraphrased
it
in
my
notes
here
but
i
believe
it
states
that
evidence
supporting
a
conclusion
maybe
less
substantial
when
an
impartial
experienced
examiner
who
has
observed
the
witnesses
and
lived
with
the
case
has
drawn
different
conclusions
from
the
boards.
if
i
might
get
into
the
--
the
particular
facts
insofar
as
--
as
this
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
a
--
a
--
with
this
qualification,
that
possibly
it's
not
only
some
specific
prearranged
plan
but
some
type
of
sham
or
device
used
whereby
it
is
evident
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
sir?
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
believe
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
believe
that
--
the
reason
i
wanted
to
get
into
the
facts
is
that
i
want
to
--
to
try
to
show
that
this
is
not
a
situation
where
mr.
shannon
has
a
big
driving
business
on
one
hand
and
then
just
hauls
a
little
sugar
back.
that
--
that's
not
the
facts
at
all
that
the
examiner
in
making
his
findings
and
the
evidence
clearly
reflects
that
the
major
portion
of
the
assets
of
this
company
are
not
tied
up
at
any
transportation
facilities
which
in
other
cases
has
been
held
to
be
a
very
important
factor
in
which
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case
comments
upon.
the
major
portion
of
the
salaries
of
the
company
are
not
tied
up
or
paid
to
truck
drivers.
he
has
never
held
himself
out
to
the
general
public
to
haul
for-hire,
has
never
been
engaged
in
any
major
truck
operations.
all
these
were
findings
made
by
the
examiner
that
were
substantiated
clearly
in
the
record
that
there
were
no
identifiable
transportation
charges
made
by
shannon
to
the
purchasers
of
the
sugar
or
any
formula
to
asses
those
transportation
charges
but
instead,
his
sales
are
governed
solely
by
the
market
price
of
sugar
in
the
san
antonio
area
that
he
purchases
the
sugar,
taking
title
in
his
own
name,
bears
all
the
losses
that
maybe
involved
on
the
same
and
attempts
to
sell
the
sugar
as
quickly
as
possible
since
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
price
on
--
in
sugar
breaks
very
rapidly.
the
margin
of
profit
is
very,
very
narrow
and
the
commodity
deteriorates
very
quickly.
as
mr.
ginnane
had
said
it's
--
it's
like
cash
money
except
that
the
--
the
dollar
possibly
doesn't
deteriorate
so
fast
in
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
e.
&
r.
shannon
company.
it's
--
actually,
the
reason
i
speak
of
shannon
only
is
that
this
was
a
company
that
a
father
and
son
rented,
r.
shannon
is
--
was
the
son
and
e.
shannon
was
the
father.
and
when
he
died,
his
mother
--
richard
shannon's
mother
inherited
a
portion
of
the
company
and
they
continued
to
do
business
under
the
name
of
e.
&
r.
shannon
and
they
just
substituted
the
name
emma
(ph)
shannon.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
san
antonio,
texas.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
that
it
was
not
the
appellees'
practice
to
take
orders
for
the
sugar
and
then
to
purchase
it,
that
they
sell
the
sugar
for
the
going
market
profit
in
the
san
antonio
area.
i
might
mention
in
response
to
a
question
that
was
asked
mr.
ginnane.
it's
clearly
developed
in
the
record
that
the
word
consignee
that
is
used
on
exhibit
1
that
was
referred
to
was
merely
the
word
that
was
selected
by
the
representative
of
the
bureau
of
inquiry
and
compliance
and
the
record
clearly
shows
that
it
was
an
error
and
that
the
word
that
should
have
been
used
was
the
word
purchaser.
the
exhibit
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
toward
the
end
of
our
brief,
i
think
are
the
last
section.
we
referred
to
that
that
the
appellants
argued
that
the
ziffrin
case
is
in
point,
insofar
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned
but
we
contend
that
that
the
ziffrin
case
was
not
in
point
because
that
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
an
affirmative
request
by
an
individual
to
have
a
permit
granted.
and
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
a
charge
that
has
been
made
under
a
section
of
actual
findings
that
were
made
that
there
was
a
violation
of
one
or
the
other
of
two
mutually
exclusive
sections
without
ever
determining
which
one
was
involved,
and
that
at
least
we
should
be
entitled
to
be
charged
with
the
particular
section
that
--
that
they
claim
that
we
have
violated.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
mentioned
but
i
don't
--
it
wasn't
actually
argued
in
the
oral
argument
and
i
doubt
seriously
if
that
is
the
basis
of
the
opinion
because
the
court
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir,
except
that
it's
not
really
the
appellees'
fault
because
the
situation
was
that
the
--
the
action
was
brought
against
us
under
section
206
--
306
(a)
or
in
309
(a),
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
we
have
raised
that
--
that
point
but
certainly
that's
not
our
--
our
only
contention
because
we
believe
that
--
that
that
is
a
--
a
technical
defense,
at
least
that's
what
we've
called
it
but
that
from
the
facts,
there
has
--
we
have
a
primary
business
of
buying
and
selling
many
items
including
sugar.
and
further,
in
the
first
place,
there
are
two
possible
ways
to
interpret
the
act
-
one
a
broad
way,
one
a
more
narrow
interpretation.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
we
believe
of
course
that
it
depends
upon
the
interpolate
--
interpretation
of
what
is
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
--
a
primary
business
enterprise.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
and
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir,
although
our
position
is
that
when
the
language
and
--
unless
such
transportation
is
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation
of
such
persons
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
the
question
boils
down
to
--
well,
actually
two
things.
first,
we
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
--
the
test
of
this
primary
business
enterprise
should
be
so
narrowed
and
restricted
so
that
we
must
show
that
we
are
a
primary
business
only
insofar
as
sugar
is
concerned
but
it
is
--
the
court
should
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole
and
the
business
as
a
whole
and
our
operation
as
a
whole.
that's
the
first
point.
the
second
point
is
we
feel
that
we
have
--
can
show
and
the
facts
do
show
that
we
are
really
in
the
primary
business
of
buying
and
selling
sugar.
and
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
definitely
do
because
under
the
language
of
all
the
briefs
in
this
case,
insofar
as
the
appellant
is
concerned
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
their
opinion
specifically
state
that
203
(c)
didn't
change
the
law
in
any
way
but
merely
codified
what
was
being
interpreted
by
the
courts
and
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
prior
to
the
amendment,
has
made
specifically
a
portion
of
the
act.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
but
we
feel,
of
course,
that
in
their
opinion,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
reads
something
more
into
the
amendment
that
is
really
there.
they
see
--
seem
to
read
into
the
amendment
a
further
requirements
and
then
really
the
--
the
primary
business
test
was
designed
to
--
to
prevent
it.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
at
least
that
those
are
all
factors
going
into
the
entire
picture
just
like
in
all
the
cases,
it's
necessary
to
--
to
scrutinize
the
entire
operation
to
determine
--
is
this
man
a
bona
fide
carrier,
a
private
carrier
of
his
own
materials
or
is
this
a
situation
where
there
is
either
some
implied
or
actual
fraud
or
subterfuge
or
an
intention
to
get
around
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act
and
to
evade
the
principles
of
the
act.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir.
in
--
specifically
the
act
says
a
primary
business,
not
the
primary
business
enterprise
which
would
mean
that
an
--
an
individual
can
evidently
have
more
than
one
primary
business.
and
i
might
mention
at
this
point
that
--
that
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
might
mention
that
actually
the
congress
did
not
go
as
far
as
the
recommended
committee
reports
that
were
appended
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
report
because
the
senate
committee
requested
the
use
of
the
word
solely
in
the
act
that
solely
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
and
the
act
was
not
passed
without
a
word
in
it
which
would
indicate
to
some
extent,
the
intention
of
congress
when
the
act
was
passed.
also,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
this
is
in
the
record
in
the
case,
argued
to
change
the
definition
of
private
carrier
which
was
not
done
and
the
committee
reports
specifically
state
that
there
was
no
intention
to
unsettle
the
primary
business
test
which
indicates
to
me
that
there
was
certainly
no
desire
to
change
the
law
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
that
it
was
but
to
try
to
codify
it.
now,
whether
it's
made
it
clear
or
a
more
confusing
of
course
is
--
is
another
matter.
i
might
mention
this,
may
it
please
the
court
and
that
is
that
when
we're
talking
about
volume,
the
evidence
shows
that
there
were
517
bags
or
51,700
pounds
of
sugar
in
shannon's
inventory
at
the
last
inventory
taking
date
immediately
prior
to
this
particular
hearing
which
maybe
considered
a
small
amount
or
maybe
considered
a
large
amount
but
it's
our
position
that
that
is
a
large
amount
of
sugar
considering
the
type
of
material
and
merchandises
involved.
the
only
other
reference
to
any
number
of
pounds
that
is
found
in
the
record
that
i
could
find
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
whitehead
(ph)
who
was
the
representative
of
the
bureau
of
inquiry
and
compliance,
the
investigator
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it's
found
on
page
75
of
the
--
of
the
record
where
he
states,
"from
my
observation
i
went
by
the
warehouse
one
time
and
the
gentleman
in
charge
was
not
there
so
i
did
not
invade
the
premises.
however,
i
did
look
in
the
front
door
and
there
were
several
thousand
pounds
of
feed
stuffs
stored
in
that
warehouse."
that's
the
only
comparison
we
have
as
to
the
amount
of
feed
stuffs
that
he
may
have
had
as
opposed
to
the
amount
of
sugar.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
the
specific
amount
is
--
it's
certainly
a
factor
but
it's
not
important
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
record
has
shown
that
we
have
a
considerable
amount
of
sugar
in
the
inventory
and
the
record
further
discloses
that
frequent
sales
and
less
than
carload
lots
are
made.
and
by
examining
the
representative
sales
that
are
set
out
on
exhibit
number
1
that
was
prepared
by
the
bureau
of
inquiry
and
compliance
and
introduced
into
evidence
in
this
particular
case
from
looking
at
the
sales
slips'
numbers.
it
is
obvious
that
less
than
a
third
of
the
sales
that
the
--
shannon
made
during
this
representative
period
of
time
were
actually
included
in
the
exhibit
and
even
these
particular
sales
show
that
shannon
was
selling
or
obtaining
approximately
the
market
price
for
sugar
in
the
san
antonio
area.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
we
have
--
have
assumed
that
we
would
probably
not
be
able
to
but
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
--
of
course
that's
a
problematic
thing.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
necessity
that
we
could
show
before
that.
of
course
that's
a
matter
we
haven't
gone
into.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
not
specifically.
i'm
afraid
we'd
have
to
either
get
a
common
carrier
certificate
or
a
--
or
a
permit
common
carrier
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
--
contract
carrier.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
of
course,
i
--
i
agree
with
--
with
what
the
court
has
said
in
that
regard.
if
we
are
prohibited
by
this
court
and
are
called
something
other
than
private
carriers,
although
we
believe
that
we
are,
then
we
approach
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
say,
"what
are
we?
are
we
common
--
are
we
contract
carriers
or
common
carriers?"
and
that
is
a
--
a
matter
that
we
raised
and
what
we
call
our
technical
defense
to
this
matter.
the
commission
found
we're
either
a
common
carrier
or
a
contract
carrier,
of
course,
made
no
findings
to
support
that
--
because
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
and
without
telling
us
which
or
without
giving
us
a
chance
to
know
in
case
we
want
to
change
our
operations,
do
we
cease
holding
ourselves
out
to
the
public
which
a
common
carrier
would
have
to
--
would
do
or
cease
the
continuing
contracts
that
we're
suppose
to
have
if
we
were
contract
carriers.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
because
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
except
that
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
yes,
correct.
correct.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
the
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
was
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of,
at
least
insofar
as
i'm
concerned
to
my
clients
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
i
--
i
--
not
in
the
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
the
reports
that
i
have
read,
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
case
that
i
can
recall.
the
only
question
--
the
only
matters
that
were
appended
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
opinion
were
the
discussions
concerning
what
the
act
--
why
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
amendment
and
what
should
actually
be
included
in
it
but
i
don't
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
--
it
is
meant
some
sort
of
a
prearrangement
of
plan,
some
plan
whereby
the
consignee
is
receiving
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost
and
if
that
is
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
--
when
it
passed
the
act.
the
appellants
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
state
that
the
court
below
exceeded
its
permissible
limits
of
authority
in
deciding
the
case
in
the
court
below
as
it
did.
the
appellees
believe
that
the
trial
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
trial
court
improperly
substituted
its
own
judgment
for
the
administrative
judgment
but
instead,
the
facts
in
the
case
are
virtually
undisputed.
the
--
it
is
really
a
law
question
involved
as
to
whether
or
not
the
primary
business
test
as
codified
by
section
203
(c)
is
to
be
extended
to
a
fact
situation
such
as
this
particular
case.
and
if
the
--
it
is
not
to
be
so
extended,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
or
at
least
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
conclusion
and
the
conclusion
that
was
reached
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
appellees
have
said
before
and
have
said
in
their
brief
and
will
say
it
again
that
they
certainly
do
not
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
done
a
--
an
excellent
job
in
this
particular
field,
in
the
--
in
the
field
of
commerce
nor
that
they
do
not
always
have
the
best
of
intentions
in
the
filing
of
particular
actions
which
they,
under
the
law,
are
required
to
bring
and
file.
but
no
institution
or
agency
is
of
course
perfect
and
in
a
situation
where
with
the
best
of
intentions,
an
agency
tries
or
attempts
to
regulate
an
individual
and
interfere
with
the
--
a
bona
fide
business.
we
feel
that
it
is
a
duty
of
the
courts
to
scrutinize
the
situation
and
with
--
that
is
what
the
trial
court
did
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
appellants
have
cited
several
cases
in
their
briefs
in
support
of
their
position
and
the
appellees
have
--
in
their
briefs
have
replied
to
those
and
will
not
go
to
the
court
now
by
going
into
the
various
fact
situations
but
there
is
one
case,
the
cahaba
steel
case
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
ginnane
that
was
not
referred
to
by
the
appellees
in
their
brief
mainly
because
we
didn't
have
access
to
the
loosely
volume
that
it
appeared
in
at
the
time
that
we
wrote
our
brief.
it
is
--
there's
only
a
memorandum
of
opinion
in
the
district
court
and
the
only
opinion
that
was
printed
in
was
the
interstate
commerce
commission
opinion
and
we
just
obtained
access
to
it.
but
that
was
an
entirely
different
situation
from
the
facts
insofar
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned.
it
involved
the
transportation
of
salt
and
in
the
first
place,
the
examiner
in
that
case
found
against
cahaba.
the
second
place,
it
was
a
situation
where
cahaba
had
his
offices
in
alabama
and
sold
steel
joist
products
in
the
texas
and
louisiana
area
and
while
there,
purchased
salt.
the
invoices
on
the
purchasers
themselves
showed
that
the
seller
of
the
salt
in
the
texas
and
louisiana
area
gave
a
discount
for
the
transport
--
their
normal
transportation
charge
back
to
alabama.
and
further,
there
was
a
--
an
evidence,
a
letter
from
the
president
of
cahaba
where
he
admits
that
the
profits
from
the
sale
of
a
salt
haul
back
enabled
it
to
compete
with
steel
joist
fabricators
at
the
point
of
delivery
in
the
steel
products
and
the
purchase
of
salt
and
admitted
that
the
salt
sales
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
their
trucks
and
the
delivering
of
their
steel
products.
and
there
--
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
case
at
bar
that
the
purchase
of
the
sugar
is
essential
for
the
appellees
to
make
a
profit
from
the
sale
of
cattle
or
grain
or
their
many
other
items.
the
only
evidence
is
that
they
buy
the
sugar
to
make
a
profit
which
is
of
course
is
--
is
just
a
statement
of
a
common
sense
since
they
wouldn't
be
a
business
to
--
to
buy
it,
to
make
a
loss
or
at
least
they
wouldn't
intend
to
do
that
for
very
long.
the
evidence
does
show
that
on
occasion,
shannon
has
sent
over
empty
trucks
to
supreme,
louisiana
and
brought
back
sugar
at
a
profit
but
that
he
--
at
a
particular
time
of
the
hearing,
he
was
unable
to
do
that
because
beet
sugar
from
canada
and
california
was
highly
competitive
in
the
area
and
depressing
the
market
and
he
was
unable
to
have
made
a
profit
insofar
as
the
particular
time
of
the
hearing
was
concerned
but
that
he
had
done
it
in
the
past.
but
certainly,
it
would
not
seem
unreasonable
for
him
to
attempt
to
coordinate
his
transportation
movements
from
the
texas
area
to
the
louisiana
area
and
back
so
as
to
obtain
the
maximum
efficiency
from
the
operation
of
his
trucks.
the
appellees
believe
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
for
individual
such
as
in
the
case
at
bar
to
be
unable
to
buy
and
sell
products
including
sugar
when
they
are
and
have
been
for
many
years
in
the
general
mercantile
business
with
sugar
being
one
of
several
commodities
that
they
buy
and
sold
nor
is
there
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
prearranged
plans
setup
so
that
the
real
consignee
may
receive
transportation
at
a
reduced
cost.
one
case
that
was
--
is
relied
on
by
the
appellants
very
strongly
is
the
stickle
case
which
was
decided
by
two
of
the
same
three
judges
who
decided
the
clayton
case,
both
these
cases
being
cited
in
all
the
briefs
in
the
--
in
the
--
before
the
court.
the
clayton
case
had
held
private
carriage.
the
stickle
case
held
something
other
than
private
carriage.
but
in
the
stickle
case
the
freight
rates
were
the
same
as
a
profit
that
stickle
obtained
for
his
sale
of
the
lumber.
and
lumber
was
the
only
item
that
was
handled.
so
that
all
that
stickle
was
really
doing
was
buying
freight
under
the
guise
of
being
in
the
lumber
business.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
freight
rate
is
entirely
different
and
the
only
amount
that
the
appellees
received
for
their
purchase
and
sale
of
sugar
is
the
going
of
market
profit
in
the
san
antonio
area.
the
appellees
don't
raise
sugar
so
naturally,
the
cost
of
hauling
it
is
an
important
factor
to
determine
its
margin
of
profit
since
they
buy
and
sell
but
also
important
are
storage
cost,
bookkeeping
cost,
bad
debt
expenses,
inventory
losses,
loading,
unloading
--
unloading
cost,
and
so
forth.
as
previously
stated
to
the
court,
it
would
seem
to
boil
down
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
appellees'
operations
are
really
a
subterfuge
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
this
is
the
case.
all
the
evidence
shows
is
legitimate
purchasing
and
sale
of
sugar
and
the
examiner's
finding
would
certainly
seem
to
have
great
weight
insofar
as
this
is
concerned.
if
--
it
would
appear
that
unless
all
the
evidence
of
the
appellees
is
to
be
disbelieved
that
they
are
in
the
sugar
business.
how
else
could
they
buy
and
sell
sugar
when
they
don't
raise
it?
they
buy
from
the
manufacturer,
haul
it
to
their
place
of
business,
take
title
in
their
own
name,
bear
all
the
losses
in
connection
with
it,
sell
it
on
credit
with
bad
--
with
the
attendant
possible
bad
debt
losses
and
in
the
interim
period,
they
store
the
sugar.
must
they
haul
by
rail
and
pay
those
cost
when
they
have
their
own
trucks
available
for
hauling
and
have
had
them
available
over
the
years
for
their
complete
operations
starting
with
livestock
and
expanding
to
feedstock,
grain,
corn,
molasses,
salt,
and
now
sugar.
nor
are
the
appellees
arguing
that
because
they
made
no
attempt
to
hide
their
operation
that
therefore
there's
no
subterfuge.
instead
that
when
the
congressional
committees
speak
of
bona
fide
merchandising
ventures
as
opposed
to
prearranged
plans
being
setup
to
enable
the
real
consignee
to
receive
transportation
cheaper.
that
more
is
meant
than
simply
backhauling
is
not
private
carriage
unless
the
particular
party
brings
back
goods
with
other
means
of
transportation
over
and
above
his
own
trucks
which
is
in
effect
what
the
appellants
are
arguing
in
this
particular
case.
instead,
we
submit
that
the
entire
record
should
be
scrutinized
and
considered
to
determine
if
there
is
some
prearranged
plan
between
the
real
consignee
and
the
hauler
whereby
the
real
consignee
is
only
paying
the
hauler
for
the
hauling
itself.
the
type
of
plan
of
course
can
be
either
expressed
or
implied
from
all
the
facts.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
type
of
pseudo
carriage
or
subterfuge
that
the
appellees,
submit
is
necessary
to
be
found
for
the
entire
record
to
show
something
other
than
private
carriage,
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
raise
any
of
these
questions
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
their
brief
and
our
position
to
the
appellees
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
or
to
affirm,
the
appellants
in
response
to
a
question
asked
by
the
appellee
concerning
what
more
was
necessary
in
order
for
a
bona
fide
sugar
merchant
to
be
one.
and
in
reply
to
that,
the
appellants
listed
certain
things
that
they
felt
should
have
been
done
in
order
for
the
appellees
to
have
been
bona
fide
sugar
merchants.
these
included
employing,
commission
salesmen
or
brokers
to
develop
an
expanded
territory,
to
make
large
scale
purchases
of
sugar,
to
deal
in
futures
or
engage
in
hedging
operations
or
to
deal
in
beet
sugar.
in
the
first
place,
it
would
not
seem
necessary
for
a
firm
to
do
any
of
these
particular
things
in
order
to
be
a
bona
fide
sugar
merchant
nor
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
what
shannon
does
on
his
other
lines
that
he
carries
where
there's
no
question
but
that
he's
a
bona
fide
merchant.
in
the
second
place,
they
do
deal
through
a
broker
which
is
shown
in
the
record
of
the
case
and
they
have
a
number
of
sugar
customers.
also,
they
purchase
a
considerable
quantity
of
sugar
considering
the
fact
that
it
deteriorates
very
quickly.
it
has
a
very
small
margin
of
profit
and
a
very
flexible
price
market.
in
the
third
place,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
appellees
failed
to
have
done
any
of
these
things.
and
even
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule,
when
a
governmental
agency
wants
to
enjoin
an
individual
from
operating
a
place
of
business,
it
would
seem
that
it
would
have
the
burden
of
getting
into
the
record
the
certain
things
that
it
believes
that
either
the
individual
does
or
fails
to
do
that
would
indicate
something
other
than
private
carriage.
nor
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
because
the
record
is
silent
that
that
would
mean
that
the
individual
has
either
done
or
failed
to
do
something
that
is
consistent
with
something
other
than
private
carriage.
the
record
shows
that
the
appellees
are
in
a
general
mercantile
business
selling
many
items
including
sugar
that
they
sell
it
for
the
going
market
profit
to
a
reasonably
large
number
of
customers.
there's
no
evidence
that
there
are
any
other
sugar
purchasers
in
san
antonio
other
than
the
--
who
shannon
sells
to.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
but
that
there's
no
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
other
--
how
other
people
made
to
sell
sugar
in
the
san
antonio
area
whether
they
bring
the
sugar
in
by
trucks,
by
common
carriage,
or
whatever
other
method
maybe
available
to
them.
the
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
the
price
sugar
was
selling
in
san
antonio,
at
the
particular
time
of
the
hearing
that
nobody
could
have
afforded
to
have
brought
sugar
over
from
supreme,
louisiana
and
made
a
profit
because
there's
no
evidence
that
--
that
shannon
was
either
buying
the
sugar
cheaper
at
a
great
discount
in
the
louisiana
area
or
that
he
was
getting
a
higher
profit
in
the
san
antonio
area
and
since
the
average
profit
is
only
25
cents
to
35
cents
and
the
average
freight
rate
is
68
cents
or
69
cents
for
one
mode
of
transportation
at
over
a
dollar
for
the
other,
evidently
no
one
could
have
made
a
profit
in
the
san
antonio
area
at
that
particular
time
because
of
the
market
price
of
sugar.
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
of
course,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
effect
of
returning
empty
would
have
been.
the
--
there
is
a
--
mr.
walter
c.
wolff,
jr.
well,
certainly
all
businesses
to
some
extent
are
interrelated
where
the
--
that
is
our
position
that
hauling
is
just
one
of
many
items
that
go
into
the
cost
of
a
product,
bookkeeping
expenses,
administrative
salaries,
salesmen's
commissions
or
salesmen's
cost
and
that
those
various
factors
all
add
together,
bring
out
what
an
individual
is
doing.
certainly,
if
they
return
empty
that
--
let's
assume
that
they
do
make
some
profit
on
the
purchase
and
sale
of
sugar.
on
the
other
hand,
assuming
the
other
way,
suppose
they
buy
sugar
at
x
number
of
dollars
when
they
get
back
to
san
antonio,
it
is
worth
only
x-1
that
they
can
sell
it
for.
then
they
would
have
been
better
off
to
probably
not
to
have
brought
--
not
to
have
bring
the
sugar
back
because
they
don't
get
paid
for
the
transportation
as
such
in
any
event.
they
get
paid
only
--
if
they
paid
extra
only
if
they
make
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
sugar
when
they
bring
it
back.
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
the
appellees'
are
in
a
general
mercantile
business
and
that
they
sell
at
the
going
market
profit
to
a
reasonably
large
number
of
customers.
how
they
obtain
those
customers
either
by
advertising
and
appointing
commission
salesmen
or
some
other
method
is
not
controlling
unless
the
appellant
believes
that
that
is
material
to
the
case
in
which
event,
it
should
have
been
developed
into
the
record.
the
other
differences
between
the
stickle
case
and
the
case
at
bar
are
--
that
it
was
--
that
there
was
practically
no
lumber
in
stickle's
inventory
as
opposed
to
the
appellee's
sugar
business
which
has
a
reasonably
large
amount
of
inventory
considering
the
nature
of
the
product.
the
principle
assets
of
the
company
in
the
stickle
case
and
the
payrolls
of
the
company
were
tied
up
in
transportation
facilities.
most
of
stickles
lumber
purchases
and
sales
were
to
fill
preexisting
orders
which
is
not
the
case
at
bar.
stickle
sold
only
one
item
which
was
lumber
and
he
had
a
freight
bill
with
his
name
on
it
and
the
location
and
the
name
of
the
consignee
on
it
and
actually
the
word
consignee
was
used
and
the
consignee
had
to
deliver
to
stickle's
driver
a
check
for
the
amount
of
transportation
charge
which
was
shown
on
the
freight
bill.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
appellees
have
a
general
mercantile
business
and
sugar
is
only
one
line
of
the
business.
there's
no
consignee
but
a
purchaser,
no
item
or
freight
connected
with
the
sales
price
in
anyway.
the
appellants
attached
much
importance
to
the
fact
that
the
appellees
testified
to
the
present
market
price
of
sugar
in
san
antonio,
they
couldn't
properly
at
least
send
an
empty
truck
for
sugar
and
make
a
profit
on
the
transaction.
it's
the
appellees'
position
that
such
a
statement
is
not
controlling
even
under
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
the
evidence
show
that
the
cost
of
the
beet
sugar's
being
brought
to
the
san
antonio
area
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
that
the
market
was
highly
competitive.
and
that
the
appellees'
couldn't
profitably
send
an
empty
truck
to
louisiana
and
bring
back
sugar,
but
that
they
had
done
so
on
other
occasions.
and
certainly,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
any
general
mercantile
business
to
attempt
to
coordinate
their
trucks
so
as
to
obtain
maximum
efficiency.
the
appellants
contend
in
mr.
mathews
--
in
his
argument
that
the
appellees,
mr.
ginnane,
i
believe
it
was,
that
the
appellees
contribute
nothing
to
the
sugar
other
than
its
transportation.
in
the
first
place,
they
store
some
of
the
sugar,
they
load
it,
they
unload
it,
they
bear
all
the
risk
of
loss
and
damage,
they
bear
the
risk
of
a
declining
market,
they
sell
on
credit
and
bear
the
risk
of
a
bad
debt
loss,
what
other
service
is
a
sugar
merchant
supposed
to
perform.
the
appellee
does
not
argue
that
the
primary
business
doctrine
is
so
broad
that
anything
that
it
does
in
order
to
make
it
overall
business
less
expensive
to
operate
would
be
in
furtherance
to
that
overall
business.
but
they
do
argue
that
the
doctrine
goes
further
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
in
the
case
at
bar.
as
in
the
case
of
most
fields
of
the
laws,
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts
and
merits
and
those
facts
and
by
applying
them
to
the
law
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
appellee
submit
that
they
are
a
private
carrier
of
sugar
under
either
of
the
--
a
limited
or
a
broader
definition
of
primary
business.
they
certainly
haul
sugar
in
furtherance
of
their
general
mercantile
business
and
because
of
the
various
factors
that
were
found
by
the
district
court
in
the
case
at
bar,
such
as
the
relationship
of
transportation
and
non-transportation
products,
no
preexisting
orders,
buying
on
the
--
on
the
market
price,
selling
for
the
going
market
price,
and
other
factors
that
are
previously
have
been
mentioned
in
the
argument.
they
feel
that
they
are
in
the
primary
business
of
buying
and
selling
sugar
under
the
narrow
interpretation
of
the
primary
business
test.
thank
you.
