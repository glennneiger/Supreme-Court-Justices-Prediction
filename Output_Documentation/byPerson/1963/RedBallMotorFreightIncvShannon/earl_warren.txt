oh,
mr.

you're

yes.
chief

earl

mr.
ginnane,
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question
referring
to
pages
117
and
118
in
these
various
items
that
you
--
that
you
spoke
to
us
about
a
little
while
ago.
suppose
that
this
man,
instead
of
buying
each
one
of
these
orders
whenever
he
could
fill
it
was
to
--
was
to
buy
the
total
number
of
bags
that
represented
here
and
have
them
in
his
warehouse
and
then
--
and
then
would
deliver
them
as
--
as
he
got
these
orders.
would
he
then
be
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
just
trying
--
trying
to
differentiate
between
two
men
who
are
doing
the
same
thing.
take
one
man
who
lives
practically
across
the
street
from
the
--
from
the
sugar
refiner
and
he
always
has
access
to
their
warehouses
and
can
--
and
can
fill
his
orders
each
day
and
he
goes
over
there
to
get
his
sugar
and
then
transports
it.
he
would
apparently
become
liable
under
your
theory
but
the
fellow
across
the
street
who
have
more
money
and
had
a
little
--
and
had
a
little
warehouse
could
buy
a
few
thousand
sacks
and
fill
each
one
of
these
small
orders
with
what
you
call
his
inventory
and
he
would
not
be
covered,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
no,
they're
both
--
they're
both
going
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
only
one
of
them,
by
reason
of
his
proximity
to
the
refinery
doesn't
have
to
have
a
warehouse.
he
can
go
there
and
get
it
anytime
he
wants
from
a
sugar
refinery
but
the
other
fellow
perhaps
isn't
so
close
to
the
refinery
and
in
order
to
fill
his
--
his
orders,
he
has
to
have
a
warehouse
and
has
to
have
something
of
an
inventory.
now,
are
those
--
those
two
men
in
a
different
position
under
the
act?
