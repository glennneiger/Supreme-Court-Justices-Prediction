justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
beet
sugar
from
the
west
and
north.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ginnane,
i
noticed
in
the
chart
on
page
118
of
the
record,
the
person,
whom
the
sugar
delivered
on
these
dates
is
lawlor,
judson,
melvin
and
so
on
are
--
is
indicated
consignee,
actually,
it
wasn't
the
cons
--
those
people
were
not
consignees
whether
--
they
were
purchasers,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
actual
purchasers,
they
weren't
his
agents,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
your
answer
is
that
the
offense
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wolff,
the
--
section
203
(c)
was
passed
long
after
the
--
these
proceedings
ever
started.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
fact
just
a
few
months
before
the
commission
made
its
decision,
do
--
do
you
make
any
argument
that
if
that
that
statute
is
not
applicable
with
these
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
that's
the
reason
that
the
district
court
didn't
even
mention
203
(c)?
justice
potter
stewart
did
your
--
did
--
was
it
argued
to
the
district
court
that
203
(c)
could
not
be
applied
to
this
case
because
it
was
not
enacted
until
long
after
these
proceedings
were
initiated?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
if
i
can
just
say
this.
my
--
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
it
says
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
went
hay
--
haywire
in
saying
that
these
people
were
either
common
or
contract
carriers.
they
were
operating
without
appropriate
authority
in
violation
of
206
(a)
or
209
(a).
and
i,
myself,
would
--
could
quite
understand
why
the
court
so
held
because
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
these
people
as
either
contract
carriers
or
--
or
public
carriers.
but
203
(c)
doesn't
require
any
such
finding
that
they're
contract
carriers
or
carriers
for-hire
or
common
carriers.
it
simply
prohibits
certain
--
that
carriage
bypass
a
--
by
person
who
fill
the
certain
description.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
understand,
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
you
--
it
is
your
claim
now
or
--
or
has
been
ever
drawn
in
these
proceedings
that
203
(c)
is
not
applicable
to
you
because
it
was
not
enacted
until
long
after
these
proceedings
were
initiated.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
be
a
--
i'm
sorry
if
you're
still
answering
justice
brennan.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon,
you
--
you
think
that
the
district
court
applied
the
statute
--
the
standard
which
the
1958
amendment
of
203
(c)
requires
it
to
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
what
did
the
commission
said
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
here
your
whole
argument
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
whole
argument
depends
upon
the
--
the
proposition
that
you
couldn't
get
a
certificate
from
the
commission
because
you're
not
on
the
business
of
carriage.
justice
potter
stewart
or
transportation
for-hire
--
so
then
your
answer
or
your
--
your
position
is
a
resounding
no,
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
is
the
suggestion
--
the
question
i
was
asking
you
earlier
was,
if
203
(c)
as
amended
in
1958,
does
not
require
any
finding
that
you're
either
a
contract
carrier
or
a
common
carrier
and
simply
forbid
--
prove
--
forbids
your
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
of
articles
if
you
come
under
the
--
the
description
in
that
very
section.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
change
made
in
the
--
in
that
1958
amendment
as
i
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
change
in
the
standards
in
primary
business.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
change
in
the
--
words
that
you
--
you
don't
need
anymore
to
be
found
--
to
be
either
a
contract
carrier
or
a
common
carrier.
it
simply
have
come
under
that
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
show
any
preexisting
arrangement
though,
does
it?
it
might
just
show
a
very
ready
market.
i
suppose
people
like
soft
drink
manufacturers
and
candy
manufacturer
are
always
been
--
in
the
market
for
sugar
at
the
right
price
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
any
--
in
any
city.
