mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(voice
overlap)
with
the
court.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
the
appellant's
time
with
mr.
amos
mathews,
counsel
for
the
appellant,
motor
carriers
and
rail
carriers
in
number
421.
these
two
consolidated
appeals
are
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
which
set
aside
an
order
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
commission's
order
directed
the
appellee
shannon
to
cease
and
desist
from
engaging
in
for-hire
transportation
of
sugar
in
interstate
commerce
without
appropriate
operating
authority
from
the
commission.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
importance
for
the
entire
transportation
industry.
that
is
how
to
draw
a
practical
line
between
for-hire
motor
transportation
whether
common
or
contract
and
bona
fide
private
carriage
on
the
other
hand.
by
way
of
background,
this
question
is
one
aspect
about
an
important
aspect
of
what
congress,
the
commission
and
the
transportation
industry
had
been
referring
to
as
gray
area
of
transportation
for
some
years.
gray
area
of
transportation
is
a
shorthand
phrase
which
covers
a
variety
of
devices
by
which
what
is
in
substance
for-hire
transportation
is
carried
on
by
motor
carriers
without
a
common
carrier
certificate
and/or
without
a
contract
carrier
from
it,
thereby
eroding
the
traffic
available
to
the
regulated
public
carriers.
two
years
ago,
we
presented
one
important
aspect
of
the
gray
area
problem
to
this
court,
in
united
states
v.
drum
in
368
u.s.
in
drum,
this
court
upheld
the
commission's
view
that
where
a
shipment
leased
--
that
where
a
shipper
leased
the
services
and
the
equipment
of
owner
operators
of
trucks
without
assuming
the
real
financial
risks
of
engaging
in
a
transportation
service.
then,
though
the
court
held
with
this,
a
shipper
was
not
engaged
in
bona
fide
private
carriage
and
the
owner
operators
were
engaged
in
for-hire
transportation
as
contract
carriers
because
on
that
record,
in
the
drum
case,
they
were
assuming
the
real
risks.
now,
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
frequent
type
of
situation
and
--
and
for
the
commission
a
number
of
times,
in
a
number
of
times
from
the
past
and
currently
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
when
a
person
who
is
engaged
and
admittedly
bona
fide
a
private
transportation
in
the
outbound
transportation
of
his
goods,
from
his
place
of
business,
seeks
to
obtain
some
kind
of
freight
for
the
other
--
other
--
for
the
otherwise
empty
return
trip
or
backhaul
movement
of
his
trucks.
now,
what
do
we
mean
by
private
carriage?
now,
briefly,
section
203
(c)
of
interstate
commerce
act,
which
appears
at
page
36
of
our
brief,
says
in
effect
that
a
private
carrier
is
a
person
who
has
transportation
of
his
own
property
is
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation
of
such
person.
and
the
typical
example
of
admittedly
bona
fide
private
transportation
and
this
happened
all
over
the
country
without
a
question,
is
for
a
manufacturer
or
distributor
uses
his
own
trucks
to
transport
his
finished
product,
to
distributing
or
retail
outlets.
and
on
his
return
trip
or
backhaul,
he
brings
back
raw
materials
or
supplies
to
be
used
in
his
business.
now,
the
basic
fact
of
life
for
all
carriers,
either
for-hire
carriers
or
private
carriers,
is
that
empty
return
trip
movements
increase
the
cost
of
moving
a
given
unit
of
freight.
in
its
extreme
form
that
this
means
that
any
kind
of
carrier,
public
or
private,
figures
that
it
is
better
off,
if
it
can
obtain
some
freight
for
the
return
trip,
if
it
only
covers
the
fuel
cost
or
part
of
the
fuel
cost.
and
so
it
is
that
private
carriers
are
naturally
tempted
to
try
to
get
some
kind
of
paying
cargo
on
their
otherwise
empty
return
trip
or
backhaul
movements.
now,
turning
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
shannon
has
a
partnership
in
san
antonio,
texas
and
since
1934,
it
engaged
in
buying
and
selling
livestock.
in
1951,
it
broadened
its
business
to
include
the
handling
of
fertilizer,
grain,
molasses,
salt,
and
other
items
in
the
feed
line.
in
1954,
shannon
began
to
engage
in
the
sugar
transactions
which
are
initially
here.
as
we
see
it,
the
crucial
facts,
mr.
shannon's
sugar
transactions
are
these.
first,
shannon
buys
and
takes
title
to
the
sugar
at
a
sugar
refinery
at
supreme,
louisiana.
it's
about
40
miles
west
of
new
orleans
and
its
525
miles
from
san
antonio.
shannon
buys
sugar
only
when
it
can
be
carried
and
the
return
trip
or
backhaul
movement
of
one
of
its
trucks
which
is
stated
an
outbound
delivery
in
the
direction
of
louisiana.
at
no
time
has
shannon
purchased
sugar
to
be
transported
otherwise
than
in
its
own
trucks.
in
other
words,
shannon's
purchases
of
sugar
had
been
measured
solely
by
the
otherwise
empty
backhaul
capacity
of
its
trucks.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
on
this
record,
he
takes
the
title.
we
have
had
other
cases
in
which
the
taking
of
title
was
a
sham.
on
this
record,
we
do
not
contend
that
it's
a
sham,
we
assume
he
is
taking
the
title
in
a
--
in
a
valid
section.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
found
that,
generally
speaking,
he
did
not.
that
he
was
successful
in
obtaining
orders
for
either
--
while
the
sugar
was
en
route
back
from
the
refinery
to
san
antonio
or
very
shortly
after
arriving
in
san
antonio.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so
--
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
no.
he
has
this
--
he
--
he
finds
his
own
customers.
now,
most
of
the
sugars
handled
in
truckload
lots
is
bought
and
sold
in
the
truckload
lots
and
is
delivered
from
the
trucks
right
off
the
tailgate
at
the
places
of
business
of
shannon's
customers
in
san
antonio.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
from
--
from
supreme,
louisiana,
yes.
other
sugar
gets
--
gets
into
san
antonio,
cane
sugar
from
the
west
and
north
but
--
but
shannon
is
handling
only
this
louisiana
cane
sugar
which
he
picks
up
at
supreme,
louisiana.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
and
his
customers
are
candy
companies,
soft
drink
bottlers,
wholesale
groceries
and
dairies
in
san
antonio.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
shannon
does
not
make
substantial
sales
out
of
a
substantial
warehouse
inventory
of
sugar.
and
i
emphasize
that
because
the
district
court
found
that
shannon
maintained
a
reasonable
inventory
of
sugar.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
court
meant
by
reasonable
but
in
fact,
it's
a
small
one.
now,
the
hearing
on
this
case
took
place
in
1957.
in
december
1,
1956,
shannon
had
inventory
of
a
123
100-pound
bags.
on
january
31,
1957,
209
bags,
and
so
on.
now,
we'll
concede
the
following
facts
which
the
--
which
the
court
below
found
and
which
shannon
is
still
urging
here.
we'll
concede
that
he
takes
title
of
it
at
--
when
he
picks
up
the
sugar
at
supreme
and
that
as
the
owner,
he
takes
the
risks
which
we
say
are
minor,
price
fluctuations,
and
damage
and
transfer.
we
admit
that
he
makes
sales
on
credit,
10
days
credit.
we
admit
that
he
is
--
does
not
collect
any
identifiable
or
earmarked
transportation
charge
from
his
customers.
he
sells
them
at
so
much
per
100
pounds
with
no
earmark
transportation
charge.
and
we
conceive
that
he
usually
has
no
orders
in
advance
of
the
purchase
and
transportation
of
the
sugar.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
in
exhibit
1
at
pages
117
and
118
of
the
record.
and
that
shows
--
that
exhibit
shows
what
really
happens
here.
on
page
117,
the
first
transaction,
the
shipment
date
of
may
15,
1956,
deals
with
the
same
shipment
of
sugar,
the
same
lot
of
sugar
that
has
dealt
with
at
the
--
as
the
first
item
on
page
118.
so
following
it
through
between
the
two
pages,
we
have
a
transaction
in
which
shannon
is
buying
sugar
on
may
15
at
supreme,
louisiana.
turning
on
the
other
page,
he
sells
it
in
san
antonio
on
may
16
to
lawlor
and
lawlor
according
to
the
record,
is
a
wholesale
grocer.
and
similarly,
the
second
transaction
which
on
--
on
page
117,
shows
shipment
on
may
27,
sale
on
may
29
in
san
antonio
to
judson.
judson
is
a
candy
manufacturer.
now,
going
through
the
--
that
list
of
transactions,
representative
transactions,
we
find
that
shannon
is
selling
the
sugar
to
--
to
a
purchaser
in
substantial
quantities
within
48
hours
after
he
purchases
and
takes
delivery
in
supreme.
and
he
is
selling
the
sugar
obviously
just
from
those
dates.
purchase,
transportations,
and
sale
within
24
or
--
within
24
or
48
hours.
it
makes
a
perfect
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
record
indicates
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
sales
price
is
large
in
--
in
san
antonio
is
largely
determined
by
the
competition
of
beet
sugar
from
the
west
to
north.
but
his
markup
appears
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
sells
at
the
going
market,
according
to
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
going
market
which
is
largely
determined
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
by
the
competitive
influence
of
beet
sugar
from
the
west
to
north.
but
these
dates,
and
as
shown
by
the
exhibit
1,
purchase,
transportation,
sale
and
delivery
to
ultimate
user,
all
within
48
hours.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
record
does
not
show.
those
dates
show
that
he
must
--
be
finding
and
must
be
selling
the
sugar
while
it's
on
route
from
supreme
to
san
antonio
or
very
shortly
after
it
arrives
in
san
antonio.
in
brief,
shannon's
sugar
operation
is
measured
by
the
available
backhaul
capacity
of
its
trucks.
and
he
never
uses
for-hire
carriers
to
move
sugar
as
it
does
with
respect
to
grain
and
other
commodities
which
it
handles,
sugar
is
different
in
the
way
it's
handled
by
--
by
shannon.
it's
the
one
commodity
which
he
never
uses
of
any
other
carrier
for.
it's
limited
by
his
backhaul
capacity.
so
that
all
he
really
invest
in
a
sugar
operation
is
the
backhaul
transport
space
of
his
trucks.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
--
they
are
shannon's
customers
in
san
antonio.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
weren't
his
agents.
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
they
were
his
customers,
use
--
users
of
sugar,
buying
sugar
from
shannon.
significantly,
the
commodity
most
frequently
involved
in
cases
such
as
this
is
sugar.
and
that's
because
sugar,
in
the
community
of
any
size
such
as
san
antonio,
can
be
sold
readily
to
such
constant
users
of
sugar
as
wholesale
grocers
and
the
canning,
baking,
and
soft
drink
industries,
just
the
kind
of
--
of
customers
that
shannon
has
here
and
we
see
the
same
pattern
on
other
cases.
in
other
words,
the
sugar
is
so
fungible
and
so
salable
in
the
community
of
any
size.
it's
practically
the
same
as
cash
on
the
truck,
subject
only
to
minor
price
fluctuations.
now,
on
find
--
the
commission
in
finding
that
shannon
was
engaged
in
for-hire
transportation,
rather
than
bona
fide
a
private
carriage,
took
into
account
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
transaction.
and
it
weighed
those
circumstances
in
the
light
of
section
203
(c)
which
congress
enacted
in
1957
and
amended
in
1958
to
deal
with
just
this
type
of
transportation
practice.
the
three-judge
court,
in
setting
aside
the
commission
to
order,
as
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
erred,
we
contend,
in
two
respects.
first,
it
wholly
failed
to
take
into
account
that
shannon's
sugar
dealings
are
measured
by
its
otherwise
empty
backhaul
capacity
and
that
it
was
not
making
substantial
sales
out
of
inventory.
and
secondly,
the
court
below
did
not
even
mention
section
203
(c)
which
we
believe
is
the
crucial
provision
of
the
act
here
involved.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
know,
sir.
in
a
somewhat
similar
case,
in
which
--
in
which
the
commission's
order
was
sustained,
the
church
point
beverage
case
which
is
referred
to
in
our
--
in
all
of
the
briefs
that
that
court
didn't
just
instinctively
recognize
203
(c)
as
controlling.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
--
yes,
indeed
sir.
and
we
contend
that
shannon's
backhaul
operation
of
sugar
is
exactly
what
congress
sought
to
eliminate
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
--
he's
a
for-hire
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
19
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
i
--
may
i
answer
your
question
this
way.
that
question
arose
be
--
arose
in
prior
cases.
and
commission
orders
were
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
just
the
question
you've
raised.
and
that
was
what
--
and
--
and
that
was
what
congress
accomplished
by
the
1957
amendment
of
that
--
that
the
enactment
of
203
(c)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
1957,
203
(c)
was
added
to
expressly
prohibit
any
person
for
engaging
in
any
for-hire
transportation
business
by
motor
vehicle
in
interstate
commerce
without
a
certificate
or
a
permit
authorizing
such
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
committee
reports
make
it
very
clear
that
congress
regarded
this
new
prohibition
as
necessary
to
prevent
the
creation
of
just
such
a
no
man's
land.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for-hire
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
for-hire
carriage
under
section
203
(c)
unless
the
transportation
is
within
the
scope
of
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
we
say
that
you
can't
have
--
we
contend
that
you
can't
have
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation
so
that
your
transportation
is
--
is
bona
fide
private
carriage.
if
the
only
thing
you
contribute
to
your
dealings
in
a
particular
commodity
is
transportation,
the
use
of
otherwise
empty
backhaul
space
to
get
something
for
that
backhaul.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
its
no
--
and
they
also
said,
"it's
no
answer
to
it",
to
what
he
is
doing
that
--
be
--
he
can't
readily
be
cont
--
be
classified
as
a
common
carrier
or
a
contract
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that
may
well
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that
may
well
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
it
was
to
answer
just
that
dichotomy
which
you
present
and
which
we
had
encountered
in
other
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
this
original
section
203
(c)
was
added
in
1957
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
before
that
no
man's
land
in
which
it
would
be
hard
to
say
he
was
a
common
carrier
because
he
wasn't
holding
himself
out
to
the
general
public.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
almost
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
you're
in
for-hire
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
without
breaking
it
down
--
without
having
to
break
it
down
as
between
common
and
contract
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
common
or
contract
carriage.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir
and
that's
the
one
which
we
rely
primarily.
but
that
was
not
added
until
the
1958
amendment.
and
i
was
saying
to
--
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
white
that
the
first
clause,
i
had
it
in
the
asterisk,
it
was
added
in
1957
to
answer
just
the
difficulty
which
he
had
raised.
but
congress
was
not
satisfied
to
that.
it
came
back
further
on
the
subject
and
with
the
--
with
the
1958
amendment
which
is
the
material
you
referred
to
following
the
asterisk.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
that
has
to
be
for-hire
in
--
in
one
of
them
--
in
--
in
one
sense
or
another.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
business
purposes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
--
in
other
words,
it
would
--
he
would
have
to
be
an
engagement
for
some
business
benefit
of
some
kind.
now,
whether
or
not
that
amount
for
for-hire
transportation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
it
depends
upon
whether
it
--
it
is
or
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
--
for
business
--
for
business
purposes
--
for
business
purposes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
i
continue
with
it's
--
whether
that
--
for
further
developments
of
section
203
(c)
particularly
the
legislative
development
in
1958,
what
congress
was
directed
at.
i
think
--
i
think
that
will
be
helpful
because
it
was
in
the
transportation
act
of
19
--
1958
that
congress
really
focused
on
this
particular
problem.
the
language
which
--
which
is
the
second
clause
of
203
(c)
was
sponsored
in
almost
verbatim,
its
present
form
by
the
transportation
association
of
america
which
is
a
distinguished
organization
of
representatives
of
all
modes
of
transportation,
shippers,
and
academic
world
and
so
on.
we
put
this
forward
as
their
approach
to
what
they
referred
to
as
the
problem
for-hire
transportation
services
performed
by
private
carrier
--
carriers
through
use
of
the
so-called
buy-and-sell
technique.
since
this
taa
proposal
was
almost
verbatim,
the
amendment
which
congress
made
the
section
203
(c),
we
think
it's
significant
to
see
what
taa
told
congress,
through
its
amendment,
would
accomplish.
and
then
the
senate
subcommittee
hearings
in
1957,
ta
--
taa
stated
that
our
suggested
alternative
is
aimed
at
the
buy-and-sell
practice
employed
by
some
pseudo-private
carriers
as
an
outright
subterfuge
to
avoid
regulation
or
as
a
means
of
making
otherwise
legal
transportation
service
more
profitable.
and
taa
said,
"our
proposal
for
not
affecting
legitimate
private
carriers
would
affect
the
operations
of
the
following
types
of
carriers",
and
the
third
type,
they
listed
was,
"a
third
type
would
be
the
carrier
who
delivers
his
own
goods
in
one
direction
as
a
legal
private
carrier
but
then
resorts
to
the
buy-and-sell
practice
to
get
a
return
load."
and
we
say
that
that
taa
third
type
fits
shannon
like
a
hat.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
taa
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
court
urging
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
and
on
the
senate
and
house,
the
reports
of
the
senate
and
the
house
committees
focused
with
unusual
specificity
in
this
rather
particularized
problem.
thus,
the
house
committee
found
that
the
erosion
of
the
traffic
of
regulated
carriers
has
also
then
caused
to
a
considerable
extent
by
the
growth
of
pseudo-private
carriage
by
truck.
and
zeroing
in
on
this
case,
the
house
committee
said,
"businesses
which
use
their
own
trucks
to
deliver
their
own
merchandize
are
purchasing
goods
at
or
near
the
final
point
of
delivery
of
their
own
merchandize
in
transporting
such
goods
to
places
near
their
own
establishments
for
sales
to
others.
such
transportation
is
usually
performed
solely
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
compensation
for
the
otherwise
empty
return
of
the
trucks."
there's
more
but
it's
in
our
briefs.
the
senate
report
was
in
exactly
the
same
specific
(inaudible).
and
so
those
are
the
reasons
detailed
on
the
senate
and
house
reports
as
to
why
the
last
clause
was
added
to
203
(c)
in
1958.
that
is,
"nor
shall
any
person
engaged
in
any
other
business
enterprise
transport
property
by
motor
vehicle
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
for
business
purposes
unless
such
transportation
is
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation
of
such
person."
so
the
question
here
is
whether
shannon's
use
of
its
backhaul
capacity,
the
transportation
of
sugar
is
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation.
stated
otherwise,
how
do
we
give
a
practical
content
to
what
congress
was
clearly
trying
to
accomplish.
how
do
we
give
a
practical
content
to
this
standard?
and
at
the
same
time,
respectfully,
equally
clear
congressional
purpose
of
continuing
to
exempt
a
bona
fide
private
carriage
from
federal
economic
regulation.
we
say
that
as
a
practical
and
real
--
in
a
practical
and
realistic
sense,
shannon's
transportation
of
sugar
is
not
in
the
scope
in
furtherance
of
a
non-transportation
enterprise.
the
economic
way
or
ideas,
that
is
dealings
in
sugar
are
measured
solely
by
his
available
backhaul
capacity.
he
never
utilizes
the
services
of
for-hire
carriers.
the
economic
reality
is
that
his
rapid
resales
during
or
immediately
following
the
transportation
of
the
sugar
by
eliminating
all
real
market
or
warehousing
risks
or
cost
means
that
is
only
real
investment
in
or
contribution
to
a
sugar
enterprise
is
the
otherwise
empty
backhaul
capacity
of
these
trucks.
of
course,
it
cost
him
a
little
bit
to
extend
credit
for
10
days
but
that's
the
sort
of
noncontrolling
indicia
that
this
court
brushed
aside
in
drum.
this
court
in
drum
said
the
fact
that
drum
paid
social
security
for
the
owner
operators
was
not
enough
to
--
to
change
the
--
the
basic
economic
reality
of
what
was
going
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
court
referred
to
it
--
the
court
referred
to
it
generally
particularly
as
the
original
203
(c)
enacted
in
1957.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
also
the
court
referred
to
the
1958
amendment
in
a
footnote.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
court
wasn't
applying
the
1958
amendment
as
such
in
brown.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
if
he
were
acquiring
the
sugar
and
moving
it
solely
by
utilizing
the
backhaul
capacity
of
these
trucks
and
selling
off
the
trucks
with
practically
no
warehousing,
no
inventory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
would
have
to
know
how
he
acquired
his
beet
sugar.
if
he
--
if
he's
getting
it
in
the
same
way
that
he
acquires
the
cane
sugar
from
supreme
and
an
operation
measured
only
by
the
backhaul
capacity
of
his
trucks
and
selling
it
primarily
in
truckloads
right
off
the
tailgate
and
without
performing
an
inventory
service,
i
would
say
no,
that
is
not
of
a
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
are
non-transportation
in
fact.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
say
only
if
the
--
his
sales
were
made
predominantly
out
of
a
substantial
inventory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
if
his
sales
were
made
predominantly
out
of
inventory
--
out
of
warehousing.
because
otherwise,
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
give
a
practical
working
content
to
the
congressional
standard
for
1958.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
when
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
can't
--
he
can't
do
it
under
203
(c).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
and
all
he's
doing
is
--
is
connecting
quick
purchases
and
sales
without
inventory
and
measured
only
by
his
backhaul
capacity
taking
advantage
of
other
--
otherwise
backhaul
capacity,
either
to
make
a
money
transfer
and
--
and
transporting
it
or
in
reducing
the
transportation
cost
of
his
admittedly
private
carriage
outbound
movements.
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
with.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
and
shannon
here
has
a
--
has
a
bona
fide
business
buying
and
selling
livestock
and
feedstocks
and
grain.
but
it
is
a
--
it
is
not
measured
merely
by
what
he
can
bring
in
to
his
place
of
business
utilizing
the
backhaul
capacity
of
his
trucks.
shannon
--
shannon
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
in
his
non-sugar
business
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
--
there
are
lots
of
sugar
brokers
who
will
sell
without
warehousing
but
they
are
not
using
their
own
trucks.
they're
using
--
they're
using
the
services
of
for-hire
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
unless
he
contributes
something
to
the
business
other
than
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
substantial
contribution,
a
substantial
investment
of
something
other
than
transportation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
moving
the
stuff
from
one
place
to
another.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
--
not
--
not
under
203
(c).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
congress
was
dealing
with
a
situation
which
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
shippers,
like
the
cabana
case
which
we
had
in
court
for
a
steel
shipper.
the
steel
shipper
is
--
is
using
his
backhaul
capacity
to
transports
salt
available
--
for
almost
mythical
story,
the
piano
manufacturer
who
was
alleged
to
have
acquired
a
--
a
fleet
of
refrigerated
trucks
to
deliver
his
pianos
and
--
and
handle
frozen
fruits
and
vegetables
on
the
backhaul.
now,
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
with
and
to
avoid
that
congressional
prohibition,
a
man
can't
do
business
contributing
only
the
backhaul
capacity
of
--
of
his
trucks.
he's
got
to
make
an
--
make
a
substantial
contribution
of
something
else
to
it,
say
as
by
maintaining
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
significant
inventories.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
unless
he's
contributing
something
other
than
transportation
to
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
got
to
be
--
it's
not
legal
unless
it's
--
unless
it's
within
the
scope
and
in
furtherance.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
a
--
in
furtherance
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
say
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
in
similar
cases,
what
he's
making
a
profit
out
of
is
transportation
because
he's
taking
a
--
a
readily
salable
commodity
like
sugar
which
is
almost
like
money
and
he
moves
it
from
one
place
to
another.
he
can
dispose
of
it
without
risk
and
quickly
upon
arrival.
and
we
say
that
congress
intended
that
that
be
treated
as
for-hire
transportation
which
he
may
not
engage
in
without
getting
a
certificate
or
a
permit
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
history
of
203
(c)
that
congress
regarded
as
something
a
bit
different
than
buying,
transporting,
and
selling.
in
an
operation
measured
only
by
your
backhaul
capacity
where
the
--
and
where
the
only
real
investment
is
of
that
backhaul
capacity,
where
no
other
real
function
is
being
performed
such
as
the
--
the
inventory
--
performing
the
inventory
function
of
--
of
a
warehouse
to
its
owner.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
i
understand
your
question
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
with.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
what
congress
was
concerned
with.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
i
don't
think
he
would.
that
--
that
because
with
that,
he'd
be
doing,
making
predominantly
--
his
predominant
sales
would
be
--
be
made
out
of
inventory
in
a
warehouse.
and
he
would
be
con
--
making
a
substantial
contribution
of
something
--
investment
of
something
other
than
transportation.
he'd
be
investing
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
burdens
and
the
risks
of
maintaining
an
inventory
and
selling
out
of
that
inventory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understood
your
question,
the
fellow
who
lives
--
who
lives
near
the
refinery,
he's
buying
it
for
his
use
in
his
business
to
--
making
candy
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
--
if
the
first
and
the
second
man
was
maintaining
an
inventory
as
we
see
it.
if
he
is
doing
the
predominance
of
his
business
sales
out
of
the
inventory
which
he
maintains,
then
he
is
--
then
he
is
not
engaged
in
for-hire
transportation.
he
is
--
he
is
--
his
transportation
is
merely
incident
in
furtherance
of
a
--
of
a
primary
business
enterprise
other
than
transportation
that
is
sugar
brokerage.
and
because
he's
contributed
more
than
transportation,
he's
maintaining
an
inventory.
he's
taking
the
risks
of
price
fluctuation
and
so
on.
but
we
say
in
a
--
in
a
situation
that
congress
was
concerned
with
and
which
we
think
is
illustrated
here
is
where
the
economic
reality,
considering
that
this
is
a
readily
salable
commodity
is
what
shannon
is
investing
--
is
the
transport
capacity
in
--
in
the
backhaul
of
his
trucks.
thank
you
very
much.
