mr.
h.
neil
garson
if
it
please
the
court.
the
time
for
the
appellees
has
been
divided
between
myself
and
mr.
murphy
who
represents
the
new
york
central
railroad.
for
my
portion
of
the
time,
i
intended
to
discuss
the
rate
situation
as
it
occurred
before
the
commission,
the
procedure
followed
by
the
commission
and
also
the
issues
presented
to
the
commission
by
the
4
section
application
and
the
reasons
why
the
commission
did
not
rule
on
the
alleged
violations
of
other
sections
of
the
act
such
as
section
3
(1)
and
3
(4)
in
the
4
section
application
proceeding.
now,
in
the
interest
of
clarifying
our
position,
i
desire
to
restate
to
the
court
the
rate
situation
as
it
developed
before
the
commission,
both
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
chicago
broad
of
trade
and
mechling
barge
line
before
the
commission
and
thereafter.
to
begin
with,
let
us
go
back
to
december
15,
1956.on
that
date,
the
new
york
central
made
effect
of
a
proportional
rate
of
5.5
cents,
minimum
100,000
pounds
on
corn
and
corn
products
when
milled
in
transit
from
17
points
in
illinois
which
are
located
on
the
kankakee
belt
line
to
kankakee
over
its
line
direct
and
restricted
to
apply
on
traffic
destined
to
points
in
new
york,
pennsylvania,
virginia,
west
virginia,
delaware,
the
district
of
columbia
and
to
points
in
new
england.
now,
this
diagram
illustrates
the
--
the
points
that
we
are
concerned
with
are
on
kankakee
belt
line
which
is
this
portion
of
the
new
york
central's
railroad.
the
destinations
were
approximately
here,
all
points
east
in
new
england
and
on
the
eastern
seaboard.
now,
for
the
sake
of
definitions,
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
a
proportional
rate
is
one
restricted
so
as
to
the
applicable
only
on
traffic
having
prior
or
subsequent
transportation
and
is
only
a
portion
of
the
total
through
transportation
charge.
this
proportional
rate
factor
became
effective
in
accordance
with
this
30-day
statutory
period
of
notice
without
any
protests,
objections
or
any
representations,
that
the
total
transportation
through
charges
resulting
from
the
use
of
a
new
proportional
rate
created
section
4
long-
and
short-haul
violations
at
the
intermediate
points
or
any
other
violations
of
law.
now,
on
occasion,
i
may
refer
to
violations
of
the
long-
and
short-haul
clause
of
the
section
4
as
section
4
departures.
now,
when
the
december
15,
1956
rate
adjustment
was
filed
with
the
commission,
the
new
york
central
did
not
apply
for
relief
from
the
long
and
short-haul
provisions
of
section
4
because
it
was
thought
that
existing
4
section
relief,
which
had
been
previously
granted
by
the
commission
in
conjunction
with
the
rail
through
rate
via
chicago
and
kankakee,
was
sufficient
to
cover
any
4
section
departures
which
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
5.5-cent
proportional
rate.
the
relief
relied
upon
by
the
new
york
central
is
applicable
to
the
existing
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
to
the
east
which
was
54
cents.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
the
diagram
between
pages
4
and
5
of
the
brief
of
the
new
york
central,
it's
the
green
brief,
green
cover,
you
can
see
that
the
reshipping
rate
from
chicago,
you
can
see
that
the
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
to
the
east
before
december
15,
1956,
that
is
before
the
competitive
period,
was
54
cents.
this
proportional
reshipping
rate
was
changed
after
december
15,
1956
to
59.5
cents
as
a
result
of
general
rate
increases.
this
proportional
reshipping
rate
is
applicable
from
kankakee
as
well
as
chicago
and
it
was
to
be
used
in
conjunction
with
the
new
5.5-cent
proportional
rate.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
in
other
words,
as
was
pointed
out
before,
you
could
go
use
this
rate,
a
54
--
59.5-cent
from
chicago
directly
east
or
come
down
to
kankakee
and
then
go
east.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
it's
not
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
but
my
point
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
perhaps
this
might
be
a
little
bit
clearer.
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
150
of
the
record,
there
is
a
map
of
the
--
of
the
route
involved.
the
red
line
indicates
the
direct
route
of
the
new
york
central
to
the
east.
now,
i
want
to
make
this
point
that
the
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
has
been
in
the
existence
as
the
rate
from
chicago,
which
is
also
applicable
by
way
of
kankakee,
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time.
and
also,
4
section
relief
applied
on
this
rate
for
many
years
on
these
routes
rather.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
assume
that
there
are
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
reshipping
rate
would
be
used
in
connection
with
those
railroads
as
well.
the
--
the
reshipping
rate
at
chicago
is
applicable
both
the
ex-barge
as
well
as
ex-rail
traffic.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
same
thing
would
apply.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
the
rate
that
was
filed
at
that
time
was
a
5.5-cent
rate
which
was
to
be
applied
in
connection
with
a
through
movement
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
--
through
kankakee.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
it
can
go
up
through
chicago.
that
same
rate
would
apply
through
chicago.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
it
has
to
go
through
kankakee
up
to
chicago
through
the
east.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
they
get
the
benefit
of
the
reshipping
rate.
the
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
remains
the
same.
the
only
change
that
has
occurred
is
in
this
rate,
in
fact
they're
here
to
be
used
in
connection
with
determining
what
the
through
movement
would
be
and
the
event
of
a
shipment
originating
on
the
kankakee
belt
line
destined
to
points
in
the
east.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
if
i
try
to
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right,
it
doesn't.
it
would
go
through
chicago.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
the
same
rate
applies
out
of
chicago.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
we
don't
know
what's
the
rate
is
to
chicago.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
to
make
this
clearer,
the
--
the
5.5-cent
rate
that
we're
talking
about
only
applies
in
connection
with
the
movement
from
this
line
here,
from
this
railroad
line
between
moronts
and
kankakee.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
if
there
are
other
railroads
who
would
be
--
who
will
concur
in
this
tariff,
in
connection
with
this
5.5-cent
rate
from
this
line
i
presumed
that
they
would
be
able
to
charge
it.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that
they
would
be
able
to
use
this
5.5-cent
rate
if
there
are
other
railroads
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
movement
is
through
--
is
to
go
through.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
they're
getting
the
benefit
of
this
rate.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
other
farmers
are
getting
on
--
on
the
other
rates.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right,
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
now,
this
proportion
--
as
i
indicated
the
proportional
rate
became
effective
without
any
objections.
now,
the
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
if
i
can
develop
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
perhaps
it'll
become
a
little
clearer.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
yes.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
the
argument
and
--
and
is
developed
as
i
go
along
to
illustrate
the
procedure
followed
by
the
commission
which
is
important
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
other
mechling
case
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
presume
you're
referring
to
the
one
on
which
the
commission
grant
a
temporary
relief
and
there
were
no
hearings
apply.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
we're
not
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
yes.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
yes,
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
the
same.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
based
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
there
is
a
difference
here
and
i
should
like
to
explain
it
as
i
go
along.
now,
in
order
to
give
effects
to
the
5.5-cent
proportional
rate,
the
tariff
contains
provision
which
provided
that
the
single
factor
rates
from
the
origin
points
on
the
kankakee
belt
line
to
final
destination
as
well
as
the
flat
rate
from
kankakee
to
final
destination
which
will
previously
observed
as
the
minimum
rates
were
restricted
so
as
not
to
apply
when
the
combination
of
the
proposed
proportional
rates
to
and
from
kankakee
to
final
destination
is
lower.
the
effect
of
this
restriction
also
enabled
compliance
with
the
aggregate
of
intermediate
provisions
of
section
4.
and
this
provision
provide
--
which
is
a
facet
of
the
long-
and
short-haul
prohibitions
of
section
4
declares
that
it
is
unlawful
for
rail
carrier
or
water
carrier
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
commission
to
charge
any
greater
compensation
as
a
through
rate
than
the
aggregate
of
intermediate
rates.
now,
however,
it
was
subsequently
discovered
that
by
limiting
the
application
of
the
combination
proportional
rates
to
the
destination
territory,
as
i
have
just
noted
in
this
area
here,
long-
and
short-haul
violations
were
created
at
intermediate
destination
that
is
in
this
area
here.
and
these
were
created
in
central
territory
and
there
are
also
at
origin
points.
for
an
example,
the
first
type
of
violation
using
dwight,
illinois
which
is
on
the
kankakee
belt
line,
about
here,
as
a
representative
origin
point
and
philadelphia,
as
a
representative
more
distant
destination
point
and
akron,
ohio,
as
a
representative
intermediate
destination
in
central
territory.
on
december
14th,
1956,
the
combination
rate
from
dwight
to
akron,
ohio
was
composed
of
the
rate
factors,
dwight
to
kankakee,
kankakee
to
akron.
and
it's
amounted
to
54
cents.
this
compared
to
65.5
cents
dwight
to
kankakee,
kankakee
to
philadelphia.
in
other
words,
there
were
no
4
section
departures.
the
rate
to
philadelphia
was
higher
than
the
rates
of
the
intermediate
point
of
akron,
ohio.
after
december
15,
1956,
when
the
rate
adjustment
became
effective,
the
rate
from
dwight
to
philadelphia
became
56.5
cents
which
was
2
cents
lower
than
the
rate
of
58.5
cents
from
dwight
to
akron
so
that
the
reversed
situation
occurred.
now,
as
an
example
of
the
origin
departures,
this
can
be
illustrated
by
the
following,
from
moronts,
illinois
to
new
york
city,
the
combination
rate
was
59.5
cents.
this
compared
to
72
cents
from
kankakee
which
is
the
first
higher
rated
intermediate
point.
in
other
words,
the
reduction
occurs
from
here
to
here.
but
as
you
begin
going
east
from
kankakee,
the
higher
rates
begin
to
apply.
and
then
61
cents
from
hamilton,
indiana,
which
is
the
last
higher
rated
point
about
here.
some
of
the
origin
4
section
departures
are
simply
tactical
in
nature.
for
example,
the
combination
of
proportional
from
moronts,
illinois
to
new
york
is
based
upon
100,000-pound
minimum.
whereas,
the
rate
from
kankakee
and
hamilton
was
based
upon
a
40,000-pound
minimum
thus,
a
shipper
at
the
intermediate
origin
point
would
have
to
move
at
least
100,000
pounds
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
a
lower
rate
before
he
could
complain
of
the
higher
charge
at
intermediate
points.
that
should
be
noted
that
the
departures
at
the
intermediate
origins
are
of
the
same
nature
as
those
previously
authorized
in
connection
with
the
reshipping
rate
from
chicago
and
kankakee.
now,
to
alleviate
the
situation
and
to
bring
its
rates
into
compliance
with
the
4
section
of
new
york
central
for
two
steps,
it
published
the
tariff
which
broaden
the
destination
territory
to
include
points
in
central
territory.
in
other
words,
it
extended
westward
the
destination
points
which
could
be
used
--
which
could
use
this
rate.
getting
back
to
our
example,
the
rate
to
akron,
ohio
from
dwight,
illinois
was
reduced
to
44
cents
whereas
the
rate
to
philadelphia
remained
on
the
higher
level
at
56.5
cents.
this
eliminates
violations
from
the
long-
and
short-haul
provision
of
section
4
destinations.
this
tariff
was
published
to
become
effective
originally
on
july
30th,
1957
and
the
effective
date
was
postponed
voluntarily
until
august
29th,
1957.
although
the
new
york
central
could
have
broaden
the
rate
adjustment
of
august
29th,
1957
to
eliminate
the
origin
departures,
it
elected
instead
to
maintain
its
revenues
at
the
intermediate
origin
points
because
they
were
not
subjected
to
barge
competition.
consequently,
it
filed
an
application
on
june
27th,
1957
in
which
it
sought
authority
to
continue
the
higher
rates
applicable
from
the
intermediate
origin
points.
that
is
between
kankakee
and
hamilton,
indiana.
it
was
at
this
time,
more
than
six
months
after
the
5.5-cent
proportional
rate
became
effective.
and
when
the
new
york
central
was
attempting
to
bring
its
rates
into
compliance
with
the
4
section
that
the
appellants,
mechling
barge
line
and
the
chicago
board
of
trade,
first
entered
the
picture.
now,
they
file
protest
against
the
4
section
application
urging
that
the
relief
be
denied.
in
addition
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
15
(7)
of
the
act,
they
protested
the
rate
adjustment
scheduled
to
become
effective
august
29th,
1957.
they
contented
that
this
rate
revision
resolved
resulted
in
violations
of
sections
1
and
3
of
the
act.
and
they
requested
that
the
commission
invoked
its
discretionary
authority
under
section
15
(7)
of
the
act
to
suspend
the
rate
revision
for
the
seven
months
suspension
period
and
to
institute
a
general
investigation
for
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
proposed
to
become
effective
august
29th,
1957.
now,
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
long
standing
rate
procedure,
the
matter
of
the
4
section
application
and
the
pleadings
filed
in
connection
with
the
4
section
applications
were
given
initial
consideration
by
the
4
section
board.
the
request
for
suspension
and
investigation
were
considered
by
the
board
of
suspension.
both
of
these
boards
are
composed
of
employees
of
the
commission
who
are
authorized
to
take
initial
action
on
the
rate
issues.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
proportional
rate
which
became
effective
on
december
15th,
1956
were
not
before
the
boards.
the
december
15,
1956
adjustment
could
not
be
suspended
because
it
had
become
effective
by
operation
of
law.
the
suspension
board
acted
first
on
august
26th,
1957.
and
it
decided
not
to
institute
an
investigation
and
not
to
suspend
the
rate
revision
which
was
scheduled
to
become
effective
august
29,
1957.
the
notice
of
the
board
of
suspensions
specifically
stated
that
its
action
was
not
a
final
determination
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
but
that
they
could
be
made
subject
to
investigation
by
a
formal
complaint.
the
4
section
board,
after
its
investigation
decided
on
august
27,
1957
to
grant
relief
pending
a
hearing
on
the
4
section
application.
these
boards
order
also
indicated
that
it
--
that
it
did
not
approve
any
rates
that
may
be
filed
under
the
order
and
that
the
rates
could
be
made
subject
to
complaint
and
investigation.
now,
appeals
were
taken
from
the
action
of
the
boards.
and
the
commission
division
2,
acting
as
an
appellate
division
on
august
27th
and
28th,
1957,
upheld
the
actions
of
the
boards.
the
appellate
division
noted
that
its
action
did
not
constitute
a
final
determination
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
the
commission's
determination
not
to
invoke
its
discretionary
power
to
suspend
the
rates
and
not
to
institute
a
general
rate
investigation
pursuant
to
section
57
--
15
(7)
placed
the
appellants
unnoticed
that
any
further
challenge
regarding
the
general
lawfulness
of
the
rates
would
have
to
be
initiated
by
the
appellants
by
filing
a
formal
complaint
under
section
13
(1)
of
the
act.
of
course,
the
appellants
were
aware
of
the
provisions
of
section
1.42
of
the
commission's
general
rules
of
practice
which
applies
to
initial
rate
proceedings
under
section
15
(7).
this
rule
specifically
provides
that
no
protest
shall
include
a
prayer
that
it
is
also
be
considered
a
formal
complaint.
should
a
protested
desire
to
proceed
further
against
the
tariff
which
is
not
suspended,
a
separate
later
formal
complaint
should
be
filed.
now,
it
is
apparent
that
the
pleadings
filed
by
the
appellants
before
the
commission
attacking
the
rates
scheduled
to
become
effective
august
29th,
1957
were
insufficient
to
want
the
commission
exercising
its
discretionary
authority
to
suspend
those
rates.
significantly,
if
the
commission
had
exceeded
to
the
appellants'
request
for
suspension,
it
would
have
resulted
in
the
continuation
of
section
4
destination
violations
which
the
august
29th,
1957
rate
revision
was
intended
to
eliminate.
also,
the
refusal
to
grant
any
4
section
relief
pending
a
hearing
would
have
prevented
the
maintenance
of
origin
departures
which
were
similar
to
those
previously
authorized
by
the
commission
over
the
rail
routes
from
chicago
and
kankakee.
thus,
when
the
commission
set
the
4
section
application
down
for
hearing,
the
issue
to
be
determined
was
whether
the
new
york
central
should
be
authorized
to
continue
to
maintain
over
its
direct
routes
to
the
east,
higher
rates
at
the
intermediate
points
between
kankakee,
illinois
and
hamilton,
indiana
and
the
lower
rates
from
points
on
the
kankakee
belt
line
such
as
dwight,
illinois
to
destination
points
in
the
east.
now,
getting
to
the
4
section
proceedings,
in
4
section
proceedings
generally,
the
principal
burden
resting
upon
the
applicant
carrier
is
twofold.
first
to
show
that
the
lower
through
rate
to
the
more
distant
point
is
reasonably
compensatory
and
secondly,
to
justify
the
charging
of
a
lower
rate
at
the
more
distant
point
than
the
corresponding
rates
at
the
higher
rated
intermediate
points
such
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
now,
such
justification
must
be
based
upon
transportation
standard
as
distinguished
from
industrial
or
trade
practices.
that
is
to
say
that
the
justification
for
the
variation
in
the
rates
or
rate
levels
which
result
in
violations
of
section
4
between
the
more
distant
and
intermediate
points
must
be
based
upon
a
dissimilarity
of
material
transportation
circumstances
and
conditions
surrounding
the
respective
movements
such
as
carrier
or
market
competition
at
a
more
distant
point
and
the
absence
of
such
competition
at
the
higher
rated
intermediate
stations.
stated
in
other
way,
such
a
showing
is
necessary
to
establish
a
special
case.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
commission
will
not
grant
4
section
relief
when
the
through
rates
authorized
at
either
the
more
distant
or
intermediate
points
violates
any
other
section
of
the
act.
and
such
a
situation
may
arise
whether
or
not
the
complaining
point
or
shipping
interest
is
located
on
the
route
which
relief
is
authorized.
the
matter
to
be
emphasized
is
that
the
alleged
rate
damage
must
be
caused
by
the
through
rate
authorized
at
either
the
lower
rated
--
to
lower
rated
more
distant
stations
or
the
higher
rated
intermediate
stations.
in
actual
practice,
the
rates
involved
in
a
4
section
case
may
be
and
they
frequently
are
combination
through
rates
composed
of
individual
rate
factors
covering
different
segments
of
the
through
hauls
to
the
more
distant
or
higher
rated
intermediate
point.
such
individual
rate
factors
embraced
in
the
combination
through
rate
may
be
lack
rates
which
have
separate
or
independent
application
on
a
shipment
moving
between
the
points
covered
by
such
a
rate
factor
or
proportional
rates
as
in
this
case,
which
have
no
independent
application
and
consequently
may
be
used
only
in
constructing
the
through
rates.
when
as
in
the
present
situation,
the
through
rates
involved
in
the
4
section
departures
are
combination
rates,
whether
composed
of
flat
or
proportional
rates,
no
burden
rest
upon
the
applicants
to
justify
the
individual
rate
factors
embraced
in
the
through
combination
rates.
consequently,
the
problems
in
such
a
situation
center
around
the
lawfulness
of
the
through
combination
rates
within
the
meaning
of
the
prohibition
in
section
4
(1).
and
additionally,
any
claim
of
unlawfulness
under
any
other
section
of
the
act
that
would
result
from
the
application
of
the
through
rates
for
which
relief
from
section
4
sought,
both
the
chicago
shipper
protest
under
section
3
(1)
and
the
mechling
protest
under
section
3
(4)
and
the
allegation
of
unfair
destructive
competitive
practices
are
directed
primarily,
if
not
entirely,
against
only
one
rate
factor
embraced
in
the
through
rates
considered
in
the
4
section
case.
and
as
previously
explained,
no
burden
whatever,
rested
upon
the
applicant
carriers
to
justify
a
single
factor
embraced
in
the
considered
combination
through
rates
for
which
relief
was
granted.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
the
commission
is
not
afraid.
however
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
however,
this
assumes
that
the
allegation
is
properly
directed
or
results
from
the
allegation
of
violations
actually
result
from
the
through
rates
and
the
through
routes
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
situation.
now
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
essentially,
i
believed
the
position
of
the
board
of
trade
and
as
well
as
the
government
comes
down
to
simply
a
question
of
procedure.
and
the
questions
simply
is,
should
the
commission
had
considered
the
allegation
raised
by
the
chicago
board
of
trade?
and
the
answer
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
allegation
was
made
in
relation
to
a
group
of
shippers
at
chicago
who
are
not
affected
directly
by
the
transportation
rate
involved.
what
they're
affected
by
is
a
trade
practice.
they
bought
this
whole
corn
but
they
didn't
know
what
price
to
quote
for
the
sale
of
it
because
they
didn't
know
where
it
was
going
to
be
milled.
they
didn't
know
where
in
this
area
between
kankakee
and
ultimate
destination,
they
were
going
to
have
a
buyer
who
was
going
to
be
able
to
mill
it
in
transit.
now,
one
thing
is
clear
from
this
record
that
the
--
that
the
corn
product
shipper
and
the
corn
--
and
that
is
--
as
between
the
corn
product
shipper
at
kankakee.
and
those
located
in
chicago
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
in
the
rates
or
the
rate
treatments
there.
they
had
treated
alike
as
between
whole
corn
shipper
of
kankakee
and
chicago.
they
have
the
same
situation.
they
are
treated
alike.
the
only
one
--
the
only
--
the
only
complaint
that
we
have
had
is
in
relation
to
some
whole
corn
speculators
who
don't
happen
to
know
who
the
final
processor
is
going
to
be
when
they
buy
the
corn.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
they
may
have
a
right
to
challenge
the
law
but
they've
got
to
come
in
and
point
out
to
where
the
transportation
rate
and
the
transportation
conditions
actually
affect
them.
now,
what
affects
them
here
is
not
that,
but
the
fact
that
they
don't
know
who
they're
going
to
sell
to.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
question
of
destructive
competition
that
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
commission
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that
was
part
of
the
case.
well,
this
is
the
case
of
the
barge
line.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
but
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
let
me
explain.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
i
think
the
important
point,
mr.
justice
black,
is
this,
that
what
the
commission
had
reported
in
this
case
wouldn't
have
permitted
it
to
go
further
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
--
i
will
--
i
will
try
to
develop
it
in
my
argument
to
point
out
why
section
--
why
--
if
--
even
the
commission
had
denied
the
4
section
application
here,
it
wouldn't
have
helped
the
situation
that
chicago
undid.
the
three,
four
violations
would
have
continued.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
let
me
make
this
point.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
as
--
as
the
--
the
appellant
here
stated,
and
that's
why
i
pointed
out,
the
rate
from
chicago,
the
reshipping
rate,
this
had
been
in
effect
for
many
years.
it's
out
of
the
reshipping
rate
that
any
cut-back
comes
and
that
rate
as
a
separate
rate
had
not
--
was
not
before
the
commission.
its
lawfulness
was
not
being
challenged.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
this
is
their
argument.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
this
is
their
argument.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
this
is
their
argument.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
not
that
they
should've
brought
up
in
another
way,
but
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
that
was
before
the
commission.
and
if
in
fact,
they
felt
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
commission
could
have
if
it
had
wanted
to.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
and
this
(voice
overlap)
different
proceeding.
they
could
--
the
commission
could
have
instituted
a
different
proceeding
and
other
investigation.
but
that
was
no
reason
to
holdup
any
action
on
this
4
section
application
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
situation.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
not
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
this
was
brought
up
previously
when
the
section
15
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
was
amended
and
there
has
been
a
case
on
that
point.
and
i
might
add
that
my
colleague
has
prepared
to
discuss
that.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
don't
know
of
any
recommendations
of
such
a
thing.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
your
honor,
a
great
--
many
of
these
cases
depend
upon
the
parties
primarily.
the
commission,
in
the
normal
course
of
its
proceedings,
will
move
this
thing
along
as
rapidly
as
possible.
it
all
depends
upon
when
the
parties
are
prepared
to
present
their
case
--
when
and
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
--
and
to
bring
--
in
the
normal
course
of
due
process.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
now
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
don't
think
there
would
be
too
much
difference.
i
think
probably
many
of
these
cases
run
between
a
year
and
two
years
depending
upon
the
evidence,
depending
upon
whether
the
parties
are
prepared
to
go
to
hearing.
these
are
imponderables
which
make
it
difficult
to
come
up
with
any
definite
time
limitation.
but
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
evidence
is
here,
but
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
if
this
is
what
they're
going
to
rely
upon,
my
feeling
is
that
the
commission
could
not
come
out
with
any
other
decision
than
it
has.
i
might
say
this
that
the
commission
has
found
in
this
record
that
could
--
based
upon
the
records,
based
upon
the
evidence,
the
commission
didn't
ignored
the
evidence
entirely
now.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
the
commission
in
its
report,
and
this
is
at
page
27
of
the
record,
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
indication
of
undue
damage
to
chicago.
now,
i
want
to
make
this
point
that
if
the
commission
--
if
the
commission
had
said
simply
undue
prejudice
or
any
undue
preference
relationship
here,
it's
simply
a
choice
of
words,
and
if
it
constitutes,
i'd
rather
simply
say
undue
damage,
i
would
say
that
there
was
no
prejudicial
area
shown
in
the
use
of
such
language.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
yes.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
a
section
4
proceeding.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
this
was
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
the
purpose
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
purpose
of
the
application
and
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
that
for
one
moment
was
this.
the
new
york
central
insofar
as
the
4
section
is
concerned,
now,
we
only
have
the
4
section
matter
before
us.
that's
all
the
commission
had
before
it.
had
cleared
all
of
the
4
section
except
as
to
some
origin
departures
which
existed
between
kankakee
and
hamilton,
indiana.
as
to
this
--
as
to
this
portion,
that's
all
the
application
was
concerned
with
is
--
was
to
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
it
would've
permitted
--
it
would've
permitted
continuing
the
reduced
through
rates
from
points
on
the
kankakee
belt
line,
movements
of
traffic
through
kankakee
to
ultimate
destination
in
this
area.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
they
had
another
alternative.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
other
alternative
would
have
been
precisely
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
the
19
--
with
the
1957
rate
revision
and
that
would
have
been
to
clear
the
4
section
departures
that
is
grade
the
rate
all
the
way
through,
and
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
4
section
case
at
all.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
exactly
what
happens
and
what
the
supreme
court
has
--
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
4
section
case
--
in
the
other
4
section
cases
in
the
past,
that
the
railroads
have
the
alternatives
of
adjusting
this
situation,
raising
or
lowering,
upgrading
the
rate
all
the
way
through
to
remove
any
prejudice
to
the
undue
prejudice
to
the
intermediate
point.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that
--
that
was
not
done
but
they
could
have
this
alternative
if
the
4
section
application
had
been
denied.
my
time
is
up.
i
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
higher
rated
points,
the
points
of
the
--
that
the
intermediate
points
--
the
points
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that
is
between
kankakee
and
hamilton,
indiana.
these
were
points
that
were
going
to
be
maintained
at
a
higher
rate
level.
and
as
to
them
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
the
barge
line
wasn't
competing
there
at
all.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
precisely
--
that's
precisely
our
point,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
what
they're
trying
to
do
here,
by
in
direction,
is
to
get
a
cancellation
of
rates
which
they
should
have
done
and
which
they
could
have
done
a
long
time
ago
by
going
into
a
section
13
(1)
proceeding.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
they
have
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
they
have
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
this
is
--
this
is
an
important
point.
they
would
have
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
--
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
rates
became
effective
on
december
15th,
1956,
the
reductions
along
this
line
of
railroad
for
use
in
connection
with
movements
all
the
way
through
to
new
york.
they
became
effective
six
months
before
they
even
came
into
the
picture.
and
at
that
time,
would
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
and
of
course
those
rates
have
been
filed
with
the
commission,
the
tariffs
had
been
filed
with
the
commission
under
the
proper
statutes,
section
6
(3)
which
says
that
they
have
gave
the
--
everybody
three
days
notice.
everyone
had
notice
of
these
rates.
they
could
have
come
in
and
protested.
they
could
have
come
in
and
ask
for
a
suspension.
no
one
did.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
true
but
they
had
eight
years
in
which
to
rest
toward
the
proceeding.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
i
appeal
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
appeal
this
that
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
type
of
allegations
which
they
had
raised,
it
was
discretionary
with
the
commission
as
to
whether
or
not
to
combine
the
two
or
at
--
enlarge
the
--
the
proceeding
or
to
simply
hold
it
down
to
the
application
which
was
before
it.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
doubt
that
it
would.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
as
i
--
i
say
this,
the
hearing
in
this
case
didn't
take
eight
years,
not
that
they
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
--
i
don't
disagree
with
that
one
but
--
