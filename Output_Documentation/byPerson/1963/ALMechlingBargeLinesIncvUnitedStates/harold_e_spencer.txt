mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
appellant
in
number
59,
the
board
of
trade
of
the
city
of
chicago.
our
appeal
presents
but
a
single
issue
and
that
issue
was
separate
and
distinct
from
the
issues
which
are
presented
by
the
mechling
appeal.
we
did
allege
several
grounds
for
invalidity
of
the
order
in
the
court
below.
and
when
and
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
commission,
we
certainly
will
not
give
up
those
grounds.
but
we
are
arguing
only
one
in
this
court
and
the
--
that
issue
is
this,
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
enter
an
order
granting
the
railroad's
relief
from
the
long-
and
short-haul
requirement
of
section
4
of
the
act
without
considering
and
making
findings
of
the
board
of
trade's
contention
that
the
rates
for
which
authority
is
sought
would
cause
unjust
discrimination
and
undue
prejudice
against
chicago
corn
merchants
and
against
chicago
as
a
locality
in
violation
of
section
3,
paragraph
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
our
position
is
that
the
commission
cannot
grant
such
fourth-section
relief
without
passing
on
the
merits
of
the
board
of
trade's
contention.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
united
states
generally
supports
our
position.
i
of
course,
will
leave
to
mr.
goodman
the
statement
of
the
position
of
the
united
states
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
our
position
is
that
the
commission
has
no
discretion
in
the
matter
and
that
it
must
consider
and
determine
questions
raised
under
section
3
of
the
act
by
shippers
and
localities
who
would
be
hurt
by
rates
which
are
authorized
under
section
4.
and
the
relief
which
we
ask
is
that
the
order
be
set
aside
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
commission.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no,
sir.
i
do
not
at
all
admit
that.
we
--
we
oppose
the
fourth-section
relief
on
other
grounds
also.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
well,
i
--
it's
really
a
--
an
argument
over
semantics
when
you
put
it
that
way,
i
think,
because
we
--
we
argue
that
under
section
4,
the
standards
of
section
3
are
also
written
into
section
4.
in
other
words,
the
only
argument
that
we're
presenting
here
is
the
discrimination
issue.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
before
coming
to
the
legal
issue
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
we'll
open
up
no
more
reasons
and
we
opened
up
in
the
first
place.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
there
are
others
which
we
argued
in
the
district
court.
there
are
others
which
we
argued
in
our
briefs
and
petitions
to
the
commission
and
of
course
we
will
not
waive
those.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
but
--
but
they
raised
--
for
the
most
part,
they
raised
the
same
legal
issue
as
the
--
as
the
issue
which
we're
arguing
here.
in
other
words,
the
commission
didn't
consider
them
properly.
now,
before
coming
to
the
legal
issues,
i
would
like
to
explain
briefly
some
of
the
facts
which
have
a
bearing
on
our
particular
issue.
and
to
do
that,
i
go
back
to
the
situation
as
it
existed
prior
to
december
the
15th,
1956
and
look
at
some
of
the
important
features
of
the
grain
rate
adjustment.
first,
it
is
essential
that
the
court
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
transit.
and
what
that
essentially
means
is
that
you
take
two
separate
movements,
you
tie
them
together
with
a
transit
privilege
and
you
treat
them
as
if
they
were
one
single
movement.
now,
that
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
--
your
honor.
and
the
two
types
of
transit
privileges
--
the
two
general
types
are
storage
and
transit
privileges
and
milling
or
processing
in
transit.
now,
the
three
examples
which
i
will
use
are
based
upon
the
example
which
we
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief
of
the
movement
of
--
of
corn
non-corn
products
from
union
hill,
illinois
to
new
york.
and
union
hill
is
located
just
west
of
kankakee
on
the
kankakee
belt
line.
now,
suppose
that
a
--
a
shipper
or
a
corn
merchant
at
chicago,
and
i'm
speaking
now,
i
--
when
i
speak
of
corn
merchants,
people
who
buy
and
sells
grain.
they
range
all
the
way
from
the
big
corn
merchants
like
the
continental
grain
company,
cargill,
down
to
a
very
small
corn
merchants
and
--
and
of
all
sizes.
but
i'm
speaking
of
a
merchant
as
distinguished
from
a
processor.
a
merchant
who
buys
corn
in
chicago
and
here
again,
corn
is
bought
in
a
number
of
ways.
but
generally
speaking,
this
will
--
is
a
typical
illustration
of
what
happened.
he
will
post
to
bid
and
say,
“i
will
pay
so
much
for
corn
delivered
to
chicago
tomorrow.”
the
elevator
at
union
hill,
knowing
prior
to
december
15th,
1956
that
its
rate
to
chicago
was
19
cents
a
hundred
pounds,
will
look
at
the
chicago
bid
and
see
how
much
he
will
net
at
his
elevator
in
union
hill.
if
he
accepts
the
bid
and
ships
the
corn
to
chicago,
the
chicago
buyer
will
be
the
one
who
actually
pays
the
freight
but
he
will
--
he
will
deduct
it
from
the
invoice
price
so
that
the
union
hill
elevator
man
will
get
what
the
chicago
price
less
the
freight
to
chicago.
now,
the
chicago
merchant,
say,
puts
that
in
his
elevator,
he
stores
it
in
an
elevator
and
he
ships
it
to
new
york.
and
six
months
later,
the
applicable
rate
at
that
time
was
a
through
single
factor
rate
on
corn
of
68
cents.
now
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
from
union
hill
to
new
york,
a
single
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
you
consider
it
as
if
it
had
moved
direct
from
union
hill
to
new
york
on
a
rate
of
68
cents.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
all
rail.
and
as
--
and
since
19
cents
has
been
paid
in,
what
he
pays
out
is
49
cents.
now,
let's
assume
that
a
chicago
processor
buys
that
corn,
it
is
essentially
the
same
transaction
as
in
the
case
of
the
merchant
except
that
he
processes
it
instead
of
storing
it
in
transit.
and
when
he
ships
it
out,
it's
a
single
factor
rate
of
68.5
cents,
.5-cent
higher
than
the
rate
on
corn.
again,
it
was
a
single
factor
rate
from
union
hill
to
new
york.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
this
is
all
prior
to
december
the
15th,
1956
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
--
when
this
case
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
--
started.
now,
in
--
the
main
thing
to
remember
about
that
is
that
the
grain
products
rate
was
.5-cent
higher
than
the
grain
rate.
the
corn
products
were
.5-cent
higher
than
corn
and
that
has
been
the
feature
of
the
eastern
rate
structure
from
illinois
to
the
east
ever
since
1918.
now,
the
kankakee
processor,
essentially,
the
same
thing
happened
to
him.
if
he
processed
it
and
send
it
to
the
east,
he
also
had
a
through
rate
of
68.5
cents.
now,
this
brings
us
to
another
basic
feature
of
the
grain
rate
adjustment
which
was
this,
that
this
is
a
group
adjustment
and
that
means
that
you
don't
take
individual
points
necessarily.
the
rate
applies
from
point-to-point
but
within
a
--
an
origin
group
which
branch
again
from
small
origin
groups
to
extremely
large
origin
groups,
the
rate
is
the
same
from
that
group
to
new
york
via
a
number
of
routes.
it
can
go
via
chicago,
it
can
go
via
kankakee,
it
could
go
via
danville,
which
is
south
of
kankakee
and
it
could
via
paris
which
is
south
of
danville.
all
of
those
points
have
large
corn
processors
located
at
them.
so
no
matter
who
got
the
corn,
the
merchant
or
the
processor,
the
rates
were
all
equal
with
the
exception
that
the
product's
rates
were
always
.5-cent
higher
than
the
whole
grain
rates.
so
everybody
had
a
chance
to
buy
the
corn.
now,
i
will
not
go
into
the
mechanics
of
handling
barge
corn
except
to
say
this,
that
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
mechling
case
in
330
u.s.,
barge
corn
--
barge-arrived
corn
at
chicago
moves
to
the
east
on
the
same
reshipping
rates
as
rail-arrived
corn.
so
at
this
time,
the
rate
was
49
cents
on
corn
and
4.5
cents
on
corn
products.
and
if
a
merchant
bought
the
--
the
corn
and
went
to
the
east,
he
paid
49
cents
which
was
the
same
balance
as
he
paid
out
of
the
single
factor
rate
from
union
hill
and
if
a
processor
bought
the
corn,
he
paid
49.5
cents
and
that
again,
the
processor
at
kankakee,
the
processor
at
danville,
the
processor
at
paris
could
all
buy
that
corn.
now,
we
come
to
what
happened
on
december
the
15th,
1956.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
if
he
bought
it
that
way.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
but
that
--
that
if
he
bought
it
that
way.
now,
i
was
explaining
the
operation
of
the
rail
rates.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
and
what
they
say
is
true,
there
was
very
little
corn
moving
on
the
kankakee.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
oh,
there
was
some
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no,
no.
there
was
--
it
was
a
small
movement,
that
is
true.
but
you'll
notice
in
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
what?
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
a
few
carloads
a
year
but
in
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
but
for
example,
they
contest
the
movement
to
chicago
before
and
after
the
change
in
rate.
and
in
10
months,
i
think
the
10
months
after
their
movement
to
chicago
was
45
cars
compared
with
270,
the
previous
10
months.
so,
there
was
some
movement.
but
of
course,
that
corn
--
because
of
the
high
rail
rate
which
got
high
because
the
new
york
central
kept
putting
on
the
--
the
general
increase
as
in
--
in
the
rates,
it
was
they
who
--
who
increased
their
own
rate.
nobody
kept
them
from
putting
in
a
competitive
rate
at
that
time.
and
--
so
that
was
the
situation
at
that
time.
now,
if
you
will
turn
to
page
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
he
wouldn't
--
he
would
if
he
bought
it
that
way
but
he
wouldn't
do
it
that
way.
the
way
he
would
buy
it
at
that
time
is
he
would
buy
corn
in
chicago
on,
say,
barge-arrived
corn
at
chicago.
he's
not
going
to
buy
corn
at
--
at
moronts'
and
pay
a
lot
more.
you
just
don't
do
that
in
the
grain
business.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
to
the
extent
--
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
moved
on
the
kankakee
belt,
it
would
be
moving
on
the
kankakee
belt.
but
otherwise,
it
would
go
to
the
river.
now
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
--
that
is
correct.
they
--
they
show
--
they
give
to
the
elevator
operator
and
the
elevator
operator,
if
he
has
a
better
bid
at
the
river,
will
send
it
to
the
river.
now,
i
--
i
would
like
to
explain
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
no,
no,
no,
no.
they
--
no,
they
sell
their
corn
at
the
same
price
as
--
as
all
the
other
farmers
around
there.
they're
meeting
the
competition
of
everybody
around
them.
now,
to
answer
the
question
that
you
asked
to
previous
counsel,
this
is
perhaps
a
little
too
early,
they
answered
this
question
but
--
but
--
yes,
when
you
put
it
in
a
lower
rail
rate,
it
does
increase
the
bid
to
the
farmer.
but
if
you
let
us
compete
for
the
corn,
it'll
probably
increase
at
a
little
bit
more,
too,
on
the
same
--
you
see,
they
won't
let
us
compete
for
this
on
the
--
on
this
new
rate.
and
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
yes,
sir.
they
have
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
did
that.
at
--
in
reply
to
our
protest,
they
said
they
were
going
to
remove
the
milling-in-transit
restriction
and
they
said
it
again
at
the
hearing
and
they
still
haven't
done
it.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
against
the
barge
lines.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
well
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
we
would
certainly
expect
to
get
increase
business
on
the
rate,
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
it
would
remove
this
discrimination.
now,
there
are
other
discriminations
in
which
we
contend
but
this
is
the
principal
one
against
chicago.
this
is
the
one
we
want
removed
now.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
where
the
milling-in-transit
limitation
occurs
in
the
record
so
that
you
can
take
a
look
at
it
and
its
on
page
212
of
the
record.
and
if
you
will
look
at
that
tariff
publication
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
there's
an
underscored
portion.
and
it
reads,
"rate
applies
only
on
corn
and
corn
products
when
milled
in
transit."
it's
those
four
words,
there
milling
--
that
are
the
milling-in-transit
limitation
and
that
those
are
taken
out
of
the
tariff.
as
you
will
see,
the
rate
applies
both
on
corn
and
corn
products.
now,
that
milling-in-transit
limitation
applied
only
to
this
part
of
the
rate
up
to
kankakee.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
rate
from
kankakee.
those
rates
are
--
are
published
in
a
different
tariff.
and
if
that
limitation
is
taken
out,
the
rates
apply
both
on
corn
and
corn
products.
now,
we
put
--
set
forth
in
our
brief
why
that
affects
chicago
merchants,
and
i'm
not
going
into
that
question
here
because
i
simply
don't
have
time
to
discuss
that.
but
what
is
presented
here
then
by
that
milling-in-transit
limitation
is
a
straight
question
of
law.
whether
or
not
the
commission
does
have
to
consider
and
make
findings
on
the
discrimination
against
chicago
in
this
case.
now,
section
4
of
the
act
gives
the
commission
the
power
to
grant
relief
from
the
long-
and
short-haul
clause
in
special
cases
after
investigation.
this
provision
was
in
the
original
act
to
regulate
commerce
in
1887.
neither
in
the
original
act
nor
in
any
subsequent
amendment
thereof
has
congress
ever
set
forth
any
affirmative
criteria
as
to
what
constitutes
a
special
case.
now,
this
court
said,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
18
in
my
brief
in
the
intermountain
rate
cases,
one
of
the
early
cases
dealing
with
the
commission's
power
to
grant
relief
from
the
long-
and
short-haul
clause,
“that
the
commission's
power
is
made
by
the
statute
to
depend
upon
the
facts
established
and
the
judgment
of
that
body
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
legal
discretion
as
to
whether
the
request
should
be
granted
compatibly
with
a
due
consideration
of
the
private
and
public
interests
concerned
and
in
view
of
the
preference
and
discrimination
clauses
of
the
second
and
third
sections.”
our
argument
is
that
the
commission
cannot
find
that
there
is
a
special
case
which
justifies
relief
from
section
4
if
the
rates
which
are
proposed
would
violate
section
3
of
the
act.
the
commission
itself
has
held
that
in
a
long
line
of
cases.
we
have
collected
in
appendix
a
to
our
brief
15
cases
ranging
from
1911
to
1960
in
which
the
commission
has
held
that
and
in
a
couple
of
those
cases,
they've
actually
said
they
cannot
find
a
special
case
if
the
rates
would
violate
other
sections
of
the
act.
our
case
was
the
only
aberration
in
that
whole
line
of
cases.
and
after
they
decided
our
case,
they
went
back
to
the
other
--
went
back
to
the
historical
position
and
then
two
weeks
--
about
two
months
ago,
they
went
back
to
the
position
that
they
took
in
our
case
in
the
seatrain
case,
the
aftermath
of
the
seatrain
case
and
that
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
but
they've
now
made
up
their
mind
definitively,
apparently
that
they're
not
going
to
consider
section
3
cases
in
--
in
section
4
investigation
unless
this
court
tells
them
to
do
so.
now,
if
there
were
any
doubt
--
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
they
went
back
to
their
old
position
and
they
changed
their
mind
again.
mr.
harold
e.
spencer
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
our
interpretation
of
the
act
being
correct,
that
is
settled
by
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
the
national
transportation
policy
says
that
it's
the
policy
of
congress
to
encourage
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
reasonable
charges
for
transportation
services
without
unjust
discrimination,
undue
preferences
or
advantages
or
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices.
and
the
national
transportation
policy
provides
that
all
provisions
of
the
act
shall
be
administered
and
enforced
with
a
view
to
carrying
out
that
declaration
of
policy.
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
it,
that
determines
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
speak
for
just
a
moment
about
two
of
the
points
which
are
raised
by
the
appellees.
they
say
that
the
only
material
issues
in
a
section
4
case
are
whether
the
rates
are
compensatory
and
whether
the
competition
is
actual.
the
statute
does
not
read
that
way.
they
are
negative
criteria.
the
commission
cannot
grant
relief
if
the
rates
are
not
compensatory
and
it
cannot
grant
relief
if
the
competition
is
not
actual.
it
is
true
that
the
commission
can
grant
relief
if
there
is
a
compensatory
rate
and
the
competition
is
actual
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
they
must
not
consider
other
things
and
in
--
in
our
argument
is
that
they
must
consider
section
3.
i
have
promised
to
leave
time
for
the
solicitor
general
to
argue
the
position
of
the
united
states
so
i
will
not
be
able
to
comment
on
the
rest
of
my
--
the
rest
of
our
comment
upon
the
arguments
made
by
the
appellees
but
they
are
covered
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief.
and
i
asked
this
court
to
require
the
commission
to
make
findings
on
that
issue
and
to
set
aside
the
commission's
order
and
return
the
case
to
the
commission.
