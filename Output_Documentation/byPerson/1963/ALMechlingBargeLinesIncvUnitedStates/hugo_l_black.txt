are
both
rates
apply
to
anything
except
corn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
the
effect
of
it?
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
because
i
don't
understand.
what's
the
difference
in
the
effect
if
they
had
simply
said,
"we're
going
to
reduce
our
rate
on
corn
which
is
carried
by
--
because
it's
carried
by
barge
line
and
we
want
to
get
that
business?"
does
this
apply
to
anything,
this
reduced
rate,
benefit
anybody
at
all
except
those
who
now
can
get
their
--
could
get
their
corn
carried
and
--
on
barges?
who's
benefited
by
the
rate
expect
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
corn
is
the
only
commodity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
that
there
was
a
cut
through
--
there
were
rates
reduced
in
the
railroads,
which
could
be
--
puts
somebody
out
of
business
and
if
it
just
run
in
short
time
and
they
could
reduce
those
rates
and
into
that
time,
the
farmers
and
the
other
shippers
will
get
an
advantage.
but
then
later
on,
when
they
put
them
out
of
business,
the
rates
went
back
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
creation
of
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
could
this
(inaudible)
bring
in
corn
from
the
west,
wisconsin
(inaudible)
go
to
chicago
to
the
east.
there
are
some,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
do
not
go
to
kankakee?
suppose
--
suppose
the
corn
comes
in
chicago
then
go
to
kankakee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
in
that
--
i
thought
you've
said
that
the
rate
tariff
they
put
on
in
1956
applies
only
if
the
transportation
of
corn
which
went
through
kankakee
and
chicago,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
suppose
the
through
movement
doesn't
go
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wait,
i'm
not
done,
i
suppose
that
the
through
movement
doesn't
go
through
kankakee
becomes
--
goes
up
north
of
that
line.
justice

do
you
mean
if
--
if
the
rate
is
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
corn
coming
from
out
through
chicago
and
goes
on
to
new
york,
did
they
get
the
benefit
of
this
reduced
rate
so
that
the
part
of
it
goes
at
the
5.5
cents
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
do
any
--
does
anybody
get
the
benefit
of
that
rate,
unless,
in
railroad,
unless
they
go
through
down
in
that
section
where
they
could
get
barge
line
shipment?
suppose
they
don't
go
through
that
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
corn
from
the
west
doesn't
--
doesn't
go
through
kankakee,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
doesn't
go
through
kankakee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
chicago
--
to
chicago
--
i'm
talking
about,
to
chicago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
has
the
icc
approved
that
kind
of
rate
or
any
railroad
that
doesn't
compete
for
the
barge
line?
i
just
--
i'll
just
--
at
this
credit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they'd
be
able
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
don't
--
suppose
it
don't
go
through
kankakee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
this
fits
only
the
--
only
the
line
where
they
compete
with
the
barge
line
down
there
at
kankakee,
doesn't
it?
doesn't
fit
any
other
railroad
transportation
in
the
united
states,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it's
just
the
same
as
though
you
had
written
by
reason,
isn't
it?
by
reason
that
the
fact
that
this
barge
transportation,
we're
going
to
give
those
railroad
shippers
who
happen
to
go
through
kankakee
and
might
be
able
to
get
the
barge
line,
we're
going
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
this
rate
that's
cheaper
than
any
other
farmers
in
the
west
could
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
do
know
don't
you
that
this
applies
only
to
that
place
that
goes
to
kankakee
whether
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
competes
with
the
barge
line
and
that's
the
purpose
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
we
reject
that
argument
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
mechling
case
that
was
here
before.
they
--
they
insisted
then,
didn't
they,
that
they
could
proceed
under
another
section
rather
the
one
they
did
on
these
--
on
these
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
were
accomplishing
there,
getting
a
high
rate
in
--
from
or
the
railroad
for
--
for
the
shipments
that
came
in
over
the
barge
line
in
the
--
where
the
railroads
went
through.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
the
facts
--
as
the
--
the
proceeding
should
--
but
the
result
is
the
same,
isn't
it?
justice

isn't
it
the
same?
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
they
are
ignoring,
the
commission
is
willfully
ignoring
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
congress
passed
seeing
that
each
type
of
transportation
should
be
given
in
view
of
the
advantage.
is
that
the
central
--
the
heart
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
i
read
those
--
i'm
not
interested
in
names.
if
the
commission
is
not
required
by
law
to
adopt
(inaudible)
rigid
rules
of
practices,
is
it?
didn't
the
commission
have
ample
authority
here
if
it
wanted
to
do
so
to
consider
this
question
which
was
raised,
namely,
that
you
are
violating
the
commission
with
deliberately
doing
that
which
this
court
is
telling
them
they
couldn't
do,
denying
that
--
whether
right
or
wrong,
wasn't
what
they
were
charging?
justice
hugo
l.
black
violating
the
principle
of
the
law
that
they
must
not
deprive
the
barge
line
of
the
inherent
advantages
they
have
by
reason
of
being
barge
line.
wasn't
that
fight?
justice
hugo

black
but
--
but
you
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
have
to
start
that
under
any
--
you
have
to

does
commission
reached
the
point
in
its
--
in
its
--

limitation
of
old-fashioned
law

you're
about
to
say
it's
under
3
(4),
under
3
(6)
or
under
3
(18)
(a)?
justice

you
mean
the

from

not
barge
them
from
considering
that
the
whole
thing
(voice

justice

what
about
the
--
what
about
the
situation
--
what
about
the
situation
of
the
barge
line?
it's
not
any
doubt,
is
it?
i
thought
you
told
me
a
while
ago,
that
undoubtedly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
undoubtedly,
this
rate
was
fixed
so
it
did
nothing,
except
change
the
rate
for
the
railroad
at
the
place
where
barge
lines
competed
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
forget
--
forget
shipping
rates
and
everything
else.
isn't
it
true?
the
main
center
of
that
thrust
so
far
as
the
barge
lines
were
concern
was
if
you
would
deliberately
setting
up
a
contrivance
of
railroad
rates,
calling
them
by
any
name
you
see
fit,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
put
barge
lines
out
of
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
argument,
and
that's
what
--
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
involved
in
the
whole
thing,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
they
should
have
brought
it
up
in
another
way,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
the
commission
had
no
power
to
consider
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
agree
to
that.
how
we
(voice

wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
think.
has
the
commission
asked
congress
to
change
this
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
made
any
report
to
congress
from
year
to
year
in
which
they
suggested
that
this
was
a
bad
law
that
that
--
with
reference
to
--
in
view
of
the
advantage
of
the
barge
lines,
in
views
to
the
railroad,
it
is
all
that
could
be
changed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
--
has
the
commission
recommended
such
a
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
relieve
the
intermediate
prejudice,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
intermediate
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
where
barge
line
was
competing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
not
interested
in
the
barge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
you
have
come
out
is
all
--
with
the
consequences.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record
indicates
that
it
has
been
pretty
difficult
to
get
obtain
that
barge
rates
and
railroad
rates
(voice

--
justice

as
if
--
justice

they
did
and
that's

eight

doesn't
it?
justice
hugo

black
they
did
come
in
and
that's
been
eight
years
since
they
came
in,
doesn't
it?
justice

black
what
--
what
reason
have
we
to
think
if
the
commission
divides
it
up
into
parts.
it
wouldn't
take
eight
years
for
the
next
one
--

to
have
a
new
one.

we

we?

you
don't

it
would
take
how
many
years
(voice

justice

take
eight

to
get
here.
justice

and
they
all
have
a
right
to
come
here,
don't
they?
justice
hugo

at
the
barge.
the
proper
object
was
that
for
the
judgment,
that's
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
proper
judgment
business
objective,
if
it's
lawful.
the
object
was
to
take
away
the
barge
lines
business
as
much
as
you
could
by
getting
a
rate
there
and
where
you
could
meet
that
barge
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
challenging
the
intention.
that's
--
that's
business.
when
it's
lawful,
that's
the
question.
now,
suppose,
do
you
think
that
if
the
railroad
was
doing
and
actually
was
losing
11
cents
for
the
time
being
ordered
it
was
on
--
on
out-of-pocket
expenses
that
it
could
be
justified
in
light
of
the
provision
that
the
barge
lines
should
be
given
its
undue
advantages
on
the
basis
that
the
railroad
wanted
to
increase
its
business?
bear
in
mind
the
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
did
not
any
doubt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
did
not
any
doubt
it
was
that
the
barge
line
is
cheaper,
it's
lower.
and
i
am
saying
this
was
a
perfect
realization
that
there's
a
big
public
policy
problem
connect
with
the
barge
lines
have
this
business
when
the
--
when
the
government
has
developed
the
streams
from
the
use
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
policy
the
congress
has
adopted.
and
do
you
believe
that
this
was
not
present
so
that
the
--
do
you
support
the
commission
in
its
idea
that
with
that
policy
staring
them
in
the
face
and
that
issue
being
raised
as
it
was
that
they
should
use
a
type
of
pleading
and
say
that
although
we
have
discretion
to
do
it,
we've
sent
them
off
in
rigid
compartment
or
niches
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
start
a
new
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
talking
about
the
argument
of
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
asked
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
the
other
issue.
i
didn't
understand
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
premise
is
what
bothers
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
argue
the
necessary
to
compete,
unless
i'm
mistaken
what
congress
said
was
that
the
--
the
commission
shall
not
have
power
to
reduce
railroad
rates
in
order
them
--
for
them
to
get
down
to
where
they
can
get
barge
line
business,
if
the
barge
line
can
carry
it
cheaper.
and
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
say
that
if
you
can
prove
that
it's
necessary
to
reduce
your
rates
far
the
little
cost
or
anything
else,
of
course,
you
can't
compete
for
them
at
that
charge.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
say
that
that
wouldn't
violate
the
policy
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
a
different
issue.
that's
quite
a
different
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
--
you
do
not
argue,
do
you?
i
haven't
noticed
in
--
this
argument
in
your
brief
that
in
order
--
you
should
be
allowed
to
get
your
rates
down
even
below
this
barge
rate
or
to
this,
unless
(inaudible)
your
business
offer
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
in
a
doubt
what
goes
is
destructive
competition
cares
at
it
purposes.
i'm
not
talking
about
illegal
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
you
hope
it
would
be
necessary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
to
--
to
meet
competition
of
barge
line
and
has
in
the
congress
fixed
what
is
--
what
--
what
you
cannot
do
to
meet
competition
with
a
barge
line
if
you
can
carry
it
cheaper?
if
they
can
carry
it
cheaper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
--
does
that
fact
they
were
finding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
railroads
are
--
that's
a
rate
that
they
are
entitled
to
under
their
--
and
--
and
he
would
cost
to
carry
that
transportation
to
you.
and
it
means
that
this
3.5-cent
rate
they
had
before
was
outrageously
high
because
they
could
have
done
it
all
the
time
at
6
or
7
cents,
18
or
10
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant,
the
former
rate
was
23
cents,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
was
it
cut
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
the
barge
line
should
run
in
the
business,
as
i
understand,
the
railroad
rate
structure,
the
railroads
could
raise
their
rate
the
next
day,
couldn't
they
but
filing
a
rate
like
they
did
here.

show?

that's
involved
is
that
part
there
where
you
try
to
compete
with

that
the

anything
to
reduce
its

in
any
way
and
justify
this

i
believe
i've
been
led
to
believe
through
the
years
that
the
railroads
were
having
a
pretty
hard
time
and
as
i
understand
you
now,
you
are
saying
that
they've
been
charging
23
cents
carrying
freight
where
they
carried
to
make
a
profit
for
5.5-cent.

you
can
tell
a
nominal
rate
up
there
of
23
and
put
a
rate
in,
if
you
could
get
some
freight,
reduce
it
to
five.
justice
hugo
l.

pretty
good
reduction.
