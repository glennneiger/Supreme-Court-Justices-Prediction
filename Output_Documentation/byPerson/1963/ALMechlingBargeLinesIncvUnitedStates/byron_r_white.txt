(inaudible)
justice

white
(voice

could
be
in
the
record
but
whose
evidence
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
put
it
--
you
put
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
put
it
in,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission
just
referred
to
your
evidence
have
them,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
mechanically,
what
was
the
--
was
the
rate
to
chicago
before
they
changed,
23
cents
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mechanically,
have
the
new
tariff
worked?
didn't
that
--
didn't
they
--
if
you're
going
to
ship
--
take
advantage
of
it,
you
would
say
--
say
you're
going
to
ship
to
chicago
and
you
--
cost
23
cents
to
get
to
chicago
but
then
they
allot
a
credit.
they
allotted
19
cents
credit
or
something
like
that
against
the
49
cents
that
--
to
get
to
new
york.
is
that
--
is
that
mechanically
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
the
ultimate
rate
to
--
to
new
york
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
the
--
from
--
if
you
were
shipping
from
west
of
kankakee
grain
in
transit
--
to
be
milled
in
transit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
they
just
put
it
--
they
just
put
a
new
rate
of
this
--
anywhere
west
of
kankakee
54
cents
or
whatever
it
was,
would
you
still
be
making
the
same
argument
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goodman,
the
rate
only
applied
--
will
keep
the
rate
only
applies
for
traffic
that's
going
to
go
on
to
the
east.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
against
that
background,
the
shipments
in
the
kankakee
are
increased,
the
shipments
east
of
kankakee
are
going
increased
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
the
rate
won't
apply
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rate
only
applies
on
shipments
that
are
going
to
be
--
that's
going
to
--
going
to
east.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
--
you
--
you
just
said
that
--
you
just
said
that
the
inbound
traffic
of
kankakee
would
increase.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
this
--
because
of
this
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
true,
how
--
why
--
why
must
not
traffic
east
of
kankakee
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
very
clearly
i
must
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
aren't
we
talking
--
we're
talking
about
the
new
york
central.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
isn't
part
of
the
argument
here
that
--
that
this
--
the
way
this
tariff
is
constructed
there
how
to
be
more
processing
in
kankakee
than
there
was
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
not
have
move
east
on
new
york
central?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
