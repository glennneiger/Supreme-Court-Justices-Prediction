mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
the
united
states
is
nominally
an
appellee
in
this
action,
we
agree
substantially
with
all
of
the
contentions
advanced
by
the
appellants,
mechling
and
the
board
of
trade.
with
the
appellants,
we
believe
that
the
district
court's
judgment
should
be
reversed,
the
commission's
order
set
aside
and
the
cause
remanded
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings.
in
our
view,
the
commission
urged
in
two
principle
respects.
first,
in
refusing
to
past
upon
the
board
of
trade's
contentions
that
the
proposed
rates,
because
of
a
milling-in-transit
restriction,
discriminated
against
chicago
shippers
of
wholegrain
and
thereby
violated
section
3
paragraph
1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
secondly,
the
commission
urged
in
that
--
its
conclusion
that
the
proposed
rate
reduction
did
not
constitute
a
destructive
competitive
practice
and
did
not
impair
the
barge
lines
inherent
advantage
as
the
low
cost
mode
of
transportation.
that
--
that
conclusion
by
the
commission
was
not
supported
either
by
adequate
findings
or
by
the
evidence.
now,
first,
as
to
the
board
of
trade's
contention,
mr.
spencer
has
argued
in
his
brief,
and
in
the
time
available
to
him
to
some
extent
in
his
oral
argument,
that
the
commission
is
under
an
absolute
statutory
duty
to
withhold
its
approval
from
rates
under
section
4
which
would
violate
other
sections
of
the
act.
while
we
do
not
disagree
with
mr.
spencer's
position,
we
don't
think
it
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
that
far.
to
us,
the
dispositive
consideration
is
the
fact
that
the
commission
itself,
whether
or
not
it
was
bound
to
do
so,
is
that
an
original
statutory
matter
has
consistently
taken
the
position
for
more
than
40
years,
both
before
and
after
the
present
case,
that
it
would
not,
and
indeed
under
the
statute,
could
not
approve
any
application
for
4
section
relief
where
the
resulting
rate
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
under
section
1
or
would
be
unduly
discriminatory
under
sections
2
or
3.
assuming
that
the
commission
has
some
latitude
now
to
depart
from
that
policy
or
to
make
exceptions
to
it,
nonetheless,
we
think
it
was
foreclosed
from
doing
so
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
if
the
commission
was
to
depart
from
that
policy,
it
could
do
so,
we
submit,
only
after
giving
the
parties
adequate
notice
in
advance
so
that
they
could
take
steps
to
protect
their
interest
at
a
time
when
its
still
might
do
them
some
good.
now
in
this
case,
the
rates
were
originally
filed
in
december
of
1956
under
a
misapprehension
that
no
4
section
relief
was
necessary.
seven
months
later,
in
june
of
1957,
the
application
for
4
section
relief
was
filed.
in
july,
the
barge
lines
and
the
board
of
trade
filed
their
protest.
and
it
was
made
crystal
clear
in
that
protest
that
the
board
of
trade's
contention
rested
upon
section
3.
no
--
no
objection
was
made
at
that
time
by
the
railroad
that
this
contention
was
out
of
order
or
in
anyway
immaterial
to
the
4
section
proceeding.
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
commenced
in
january
of
1958,
now
more
than
a
year
after
the
rates
had
been
in
effect,
the
very
outset
of
the
hearing,
the
board
of
trade,
board
of
trade's
counsel
again
made
it
clear
that
he
would
raise
contentions
under
section
3.
and
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding,
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
board
of
trade's
counsel
and
witnesses
which
bore
on
the
section
3
issue.
at
no
point
during
this
hearing,
with
any
objection
raised
as
to
the
materiality
of
that
evidence
by
the
railroads,
the
evidence
was
not
excluded
by
the
examiner,
the
examiner
did
not
so
much
as
intimate
that
this
evidence
was
somehow
not
germane
to
the
4
section
proceeding.
the
examiner's
opinion
came
down
in
march
of
1959
that
was
now
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
rate
originally
went
into
effect.
and
in
the
examiner's
proposed
order,
it
was
stated
that
the
section
3
issue
raised
by
the
board
of
trade
was
not
directly
germane
to
the
4
section
issue.
but
in
any
event,
there
was
no
question
to
discuss
those
issues
because
he
was
finding
--
he
was
finding
the
rate
improper
on
strictly
4
section
ground.
finally,
in
june
of
1960,
three
and
a
half
years
after
the
rates
went
into
effect,
three
years
after
the
protest
was
filed,
the
commission,
in
its
opinion,
stated
that
it
would
not
consider
these
section
3
objections
because
they
were
not
directly
relevant
to
the
4
section
proceeding.
at
that
point,
the
commission
told
to
board
of
trade
what
it
should've
told
them
in
the
first
place,
namely,
that
if
they
wanted
these
objections
to
be
considered,
they
should
go
out
and
file
a
complain
under
section
13
of
the
act
or
ask
for
a
commission
investigation
under
section
15
of
the
act,
three
and
a
half
years
later.
and
the
commission
so
notified
the
board
of
trade
at
the
outset
and
if
the
board
of
trade
had
followed
that
procedure,
it
would
almost
certainly
have
had
a
simultaneous
adjudication
of
all
of
these
issues.
and
if
the
commission
found
merit
in
its
position,
the
rate
would
almost
certainly
never
have
been
approved.
we
don't
think
the
board
of
trade
should
suffer
as
a
result
of
the
commission's
want
of
equity
in
that
respect.
now,
there's
still
another
reason,
we
think,
why
the
commission
was
bound
to
consider
the
board
of
trade's
objection
in
this
case.
this
was
not
an
extraneous
consideration,
an
extraneous
issue
to
the
4
section
issues
per
se.
the
fact
is
that,
without
considering
the
board
of
trade's
contention,
the
commission
could
reach
no
meaningful
conclusion
as
to
the
degree
of
injury
which
was
inflected
upon
the
barge
lines
by
this
rate
or
as
to
whether
the
proposed
rate
was
compensatory.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
that
is
--
that
is
the
objection
to
which
i've
been
referring,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
board
of
trade
in
its
protest
did
make
other
contentions
of
discrimination
against
chicago.
those
are
rather
complex
and
it
does
not
press
them
in
its
brief
in
this
court
though
it
hasn't
abandoned
the
belt.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
it
is.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
may
i
expand
upon
that?
well,
briefly
in
two
sentences,
it's
--
it's
interrelated
in
this
way.
if
the
milling-in-transit
restrictions
were
removed
so
that
chicago
--
chicago
shippers
of
whole
corn
were
free
to
use
the
5.5-cent
rate,
which
they
now
are
not
then
presumably,
a
substantial
amount
of
the
corn
which
is
now
being
shipped
over
the
belt
way
would
--
would
not
stop
in
kankakee
the
proper
thing
but
would
go
via
kankakee
to
chicago.
and
from
chicago
be
reshipped
to
the
east.
and
if
--
yet
the
commission's
whole
conclusion
that
the
5.5-cent
rate
was
compensatory
rested
upon
the
assumption
that
substantially
all
of
that
grain
would
be
going
to
kankakee.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
concluded,
and
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
55-cent
rate
all
the
way
to
the
east
was
compensatory.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
is
one
thing
that
it
concluded.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
concluded
also
that
the
proposed
rate
change
would
increase
the
railroads'
net
revenues.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
every
carload
of
corn
which
is
being
brought
over
the
belt
line
to
kankakee
would
be
displacing
another
carload
of
corn,
which
prior
to
1957,
the
kankakee
processor
would've
bought
on
the
chicago
grain
market.
after
having
reached
chicago
either
by
barge
or
by
some
other
railroad
and
which
would
then
have
been
carried
by
the
new
york
central
from
chicago
to
kankakee
at
a
rate
which
would
later
have
been
credited
against
the
49.5-cent
reshipping
rate.
now,
that
means
that
under
the
prior
practice,
the
railroad
would
realize
no
net
revenue
whatever
from
each
chicago
to
kankakee
operation
over
and
above
the
49.5-cent
reshipping
rate.
so
the
commission
says
at
the
very
least,
the
railroad
is
better
off
now
to
the
extent
of
the
5.5
cents
it
gets
for
shipping
that
same
corn
over
the
belt
way
--
belt
line.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it's
also
better
off
by
another
2
cents
because
on
the
chicago
to
kankakee
operation,
the
railroad
incurred
a
2-cent
switching
charge
in
the
chicago
railroad
yards
which
it
does
not
incur
in
the
belt
way
operation.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
and
--
and
we
think
that's
a
reductio
ad
absurdum.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
but
i
might
--
making
it
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
and
i'm
going
to
address
myself
to
that
contention,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
did
want
to
make
it
clear
that
in
addition
to
the
argument
we
made
in
our
brief,
we're
making
in
--
a
further
argument
now.
and
that
is
that
the
whole
contention,
the
whole
basic
for
the
commission's
conclusion
that
the
5.5-cent
rate
would
increase
the
railroad's
net
revenues
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
corn
moving
on
the
belt
line
would
displace
corn
or
otherwise
it
moved
from
chicago
to
kankakee.
and
if
the
milling-in-transit
restrictions
were
removed
so
that
chicago
shippers
could
use
that
rate
as
well
as
kankakee
shippers,
then
presumably
a
substantial
amount
of
the
corn
would
be
moving
to
chicago
and
not
to
kankakee.
and
those
shipments
to
chicago
would
be
noncompensatory
and
non
revenue
increasing
on
any
theory
because
--
first
of
all,
they
will
involve
additional
out-of-pocket
cost
in
addition
to
the
8.5
cents
out-of-pocket
cost
to
the
moronts
or
from
the
belt
line
to
kankakee
trip.
and
secondly,
they
would
not
be
displacing
even
more
unremunerative
shipments
that
the
railroad
had
been
obliged
to
make
prior
to
1957
to
kankakee.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
just
to
corn
products,
corn
which
is
milled
in
transit,
not
to
any
other
kind
of
grain.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
any
shipper?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
only
shippers
who
are
benefited
by
the
rate
are
the
shippers
along
the
belt
line
here
who
might
otherwise
be
shipping
by
the
barge
line.
i
think
that's
substantially
true.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
corn
is
the
only
commodity.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
if
the
barge
line
that
driven
out
of
business
as
a
result
of
this
rate
reduction,
then
obviously
the
farmers
won't
be
benefited
in
the
long
run
because
a
railroad
will
then
be
in
a
position
to
raise
the
rate
right
back
up
again.
for
the
short
run,
while
the
barge
lines
are
still
in
--
in
business,
let
me
say
that
on
this
record,
dealing
with
the
single
year
1957,
it's
true
that
there's
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
substantial
reduction
on
the
barge
lines
business.
but
as
mr.
hayes
pointed
out,
the
more
recent
figures
for
1963
shall
that
the
barge
lines
business
had
been
very
severely
damaged.
and
the
barge
lines
presented
on
the
record
of
this
case,
many
considerations
which
explained
why
the
1957
year
was
not
a
representative
year.
if
the
barge
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
entirely
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
believe
that's
right,
mr.
justice
black,
and
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
the
national
transportation
act
in
1920
which
amended
section
4
in
which
put
in
at
some
of
the
provisions
that
are
relevant
here.
now,
if
i
may
just
to
address
myself
now
to
the
question
which
was
raised
earlier
by
mr.
justice
white,
and
more
recently
by
mr.
justice
stewart
about
the
commission's
conclusion
that
it's
the
whole
55-cent
rate
that
has
to
be
compensatory
and
not
be
5.5-cent
component
of
it.
let's
just
suppose
that
the
--
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
the
authorities
are
all
to
the
contrary.
there
are
many
commission
cases
and
there
is
one
case
by
this
court,
the
santa
fe
case,
all
of
which
is
cited
on
page
27
of
the
mechling
brief,
which
hold
that
the
commission
must
consider
every
separately
published
rate
whether
it's
a
proportional
rate
and
it's
part,
let
us
say
a
part
of
a
through
rate
or
whether
it's
a
separate
flat
rate
at
one
time
or
the
other.
but
beyond
the
authorities,
let
me
point
this
out,
this
55
--
this
55-cent
through
rate
from
origins
to
eastern
destinations
includes
the
5.5-cent
factor
and
the
49.5-cent
factor.
the
commission
could
not
lawfully
reduce
that
49.5-cent
factor
because
that
rate,
the
49.5-cent
reshipping
rate
from
kankakee
or
from
chicago
to
new
york,
continue
to
apply
to
all
ex-barge
corn
arriving
in
chicago
or
all
corn
carried
to
--
that
is
chicago
or
kankakee,
and
to
all
corn
which
was
carried
by
any
other
rail
carrier
to
chicago
and
kankakee.
and
it's
well-settled
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
new
york
central
could
not
charge
a
lower
reshipping
rate
for
corn
which
was
brought
to
the
reshipping
point
by
its
own
belt
line,
then
it
could
for
corn
which
was
brought
to
the
reshipping
point
by
corn
competing
carrier.
well,
that
means
that
not
less
than
49.5
cents
must
be
attributed
to
the
eastern
portion
of
the
route
and
therefore
not
more
than
5.5
cents
must
be
attributed
to
the
western
part
of
the
route.
in
other
words,
the
55-cent
rate
has
to
be
not
only
above
the
railroad's
fully
distributed
cost
but
it
has
to
be
at
least
as
high
as
the
sum
of
the
49.5-cent
reshipping
rate
plus
the
out-of-pocket
cost
for
the
inbound
proportional
part
of
the
route
over
the
belt
line.
because
if
that's
not
true,
then
one
of
two
things
must
be
happening,
either
the
railroad
is
charging
a
discriminatively
low
rate
for
the
reshipping
part
or
its
charging
an
unremuneratively
low
rate
for
the
inbound
proportional
part.
now,
conceivably,
if
the
railroad
had
been
able
to
show
in
this
case
that
by
charging
a
5.5-cent
rate
over
the
belt
line,
it
was
greatly
increasing
its
traffic
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
route.
and
if
that
eastern
traffic
was
sufficiently
profitable
so
that
it
generated
additional
revenues
which
would
more
than
offset,
the
loss
is
incurred
on
the
belt
line,
then
conceivably,
it
might
have
avoided
our
contention
about
being
a
destructive
competitive
practice.
but
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
there's
no
finding
of
that
and
there's
been
no
contention
by
the
railroads
that
they
increased
their
business
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
route.
in
fact,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
sole
purpose
of
putting
this
rate
reduction
into
effect
and
probably
the
sole
effect
of
it
was
to
increase
traffic
over
the
belt
line
portion
of
the
rate
--
of
the
route
by
diverting
traffic
from
the
barge
lines.
and
in
no
circumstances,
we
think
it
clear
that
the
rate
increases
the
revenues
--
of
the
railroad's
net
revenues
and
its
compensatory
and
is
not
a
destructive
competitive
practice
if
but
only
if
that
additional
traffic
on
the
barge
line
pays
its
own
way.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
that's
not
the
case,
mr.
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no.
that
the
shipment
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
realized
that,
but
the
railroads
theory,
in
the
first
place,
is
that
every
carload
that
moves
over
the
belt
line
of
kankakee
and
then
goes
east
from
kankakee,
is
the
carload
which
would
otherwise
have
been
moved
from
chicago
to
kankakee
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
previously
and
then
reshipped
into
the
east
from
kankakee.
those
carloads
would've
been
reshipped
to
the
east
in
any
event.
the
only
change
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
i
was
just
explaining
that.
because
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
if
every
carload
appoints
of
additional
corn
that
goes
to
kankakee
because
of
the
5.5-cent
rate
and
then
is
reshipped
from
kankakee
to
the
east
would
otherwise
and
formerly
had
been
moving
from
chicago
to
kankakee
for
processing
there
and
then
ship
to
the
east
from
kankakee.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
number
of
cars
don't
increase,
the
amount
of
grain
doesn't
increase
because
that
grain
would
be
additional
grain
which
is
now
moving
on
the
belt
line
and
which
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
would've
gone
even
under
the
former
method
to
the
east.
it's
just
would
have
got
to
kankakee
by
a
different
route.
and
i
think
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
contention.
if
there's
more
--
would
be
more
processing
in
kankakee,
the
contention
is
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
one
thing
that
the
commission
found
explicitly
that
the
business
of
the
elevator
operators,
the
country
elevator
operators
on
the
belt
line,
the
total
business
had
not
increased.
the
commission
found
that
the
only
difference
was
that
previously,
they
had
not
been
performing
--
that
the
only
difference
is
that
whereas
previously,
they
have
not
been
performing
an
elevation
operation
by
putting
things
on
the
--
on
the
railcars
along
the
belt
line
because
there
had
been
any
movement
on
the
belt
line.
they
had
instead
been
performing
the
function
of
merchandisers
by
carrying
this
corn
to
--
to
the
river
or
by
acting
its
middleman
for
corn
which
would
carry
through
the
river.
and
nowadays,
they're
able
to
perform
that
elevating
function
on
the
railroad
because
of
the
reduced
rate.
but
the
implication
of
that
is
that
all
of
the
corn
which
is
now
moving
over
this
line
to
kankakee
would
otherwise
upon
by
barge
to
chicago
that
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
on
the
record.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
if
it
went
to
kankakee,
which
is
one
of
the
principal
arguments
that's
made
by
the
railroad
in
order
to
show
that
they
were
savings
of
that
because
of
not
having
to
make
its
--
secured
as
route.
if
it
is
true
that
the
kankakee
process
has
not
increase
its
business
any
yet
but
it
is
merely
getting
strange
from
here
now
instead
of
buying
in
chicago,
then
the
arguments,
which
i
made,
were
that
difficult
now.
suppose
that
the
grain
is
now
moving
up
to
chicago
and
not
to
kankakee
that
may
or
may
not
show
east
on
the
new
york
central
just
as
before
when
it
came
by
barge
to
chicago,
it
may
or
may
not
have
gone
east
from
the
new
york
central.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
new
york
central
is
getting
any
greater
proportion
of
the
grain
moving
from
chicago
to
the
east
directly
than
it
did
before.
and
that
contention
has
not
been
made
anywhere
even
if
it
were
possible
to
infer
it
from
the
record
by
some
sort
of
deductive
logic
which
i
submit
that
it
isn't.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
was
the
case
or
by
how
much
it
was
the
case
or
whether
that
additional
grain
was
profitable
if
there
was
any.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
has
not
done
so.
i
didn't
know
that
it
is
formerly
declined
in
any
way.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
may
be,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
thank
you.
