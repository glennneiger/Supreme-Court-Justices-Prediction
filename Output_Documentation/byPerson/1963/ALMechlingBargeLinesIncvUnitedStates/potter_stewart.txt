justice
potter
stewart
but
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
follow
that
point
you
just
mentioned.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
which
the
railroads,
at
one
point,
indicated
they
plan
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
--
i
don't
--
i
still
don't
understand
your
underlying
point.
the
overall
rate
barge
and
rail
from
moronts
to
new
york
is
--
is
what
its
does
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
54
and
50.
justice
potter
stewart
55
cents
and
the
overall
rail
rate
under
--
from
moronts
to
new
york
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
overall
barge
and
rail
from
moronts
to
new
york
is
55
cents,
is
that
it?
you
tell
me
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
the
barge
goes
to
moronts
to
chicago
and
the
train
goes
from
chicago
to
new
york
and
what's
the
overall
existing
rate
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
overall
rate
from
moronts
to
new
york,
barge
and
rail?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
no,
but
not
--
let's
stick
to
one
thing
at
a
time.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
getting
back
to
the
point
that
you
made,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
if
the
railroad
expanded
this
rate
to
include
unmilled
corn
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
barges
would
be
driven
out
of
business?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
for
a
moment
any
--
any
division?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
that
before
these
tariffs
are
filed,
the
barges
had
a
--
or
amounted
to
a
monopoly
of
the
free
grain,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
railroad
charges
--
continues
to
charge
25
cents,
has
it
not,
from
moronts
to
kankakee
if
the
grain
stops
from
kankakee?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
we're
not
--
the
--
i
said
the
terminus
of
the
--
the
terminus
of
the
shipment
was
kankakee.
justice
potter
stewart
25
cents.
justice
potter
stewart
20
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
--
isn't
it
true
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
surely.
excuse
me.
you
--
you
go
ahead.
but
this
--
let
me
ask
this
as
a
matter
of
information,
isn't
it
true
that
the
--
that
the
applicable
overseas
rate
is
even
low
--
is
considerably
lower
than
this,
that
is
from
moronts
to
new
york
for
shipment
overseas?
justice
potter
stewart
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
for
those
rates
to
be
legal,
they
would
have
to
be
compensatory,
would
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they're
lower
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
transit
--
transit
privilege
means
the
right
of
the
shipper
to
interrupt
the
journey
of
the
commodity
and
have
it
milled
or
do
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
all
rail.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
all
prior
to
1956.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
that
i
maybe
--
maybe
mixed
out,
i
think
and
i
think
it
has
lost
the
--
the
processor
in
kankakee,
more
to
buy,
pre-1956,
more
to
buy
--
more
of
corn
than
it
would
cost
the
processor
in
chicago
to
buy
moronts'
corn
because
the
rail
rate
was
so
much
higher
than
the
barge
rate.
is
that
correct?
that
is
the
unassumingly
double
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
doubled
in
a
shipment
fee.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
although
it's
none
--
no
(voice
overlap)
commodity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
commodity
credit
corn?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
very
few
carloads
a
year
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wasn't
that
it?
just
a
very
few
carloads
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
be
right
about
that
that
the
processor
in
kankakee,
buying
moronts'
corn,
it
would
have
to
pay
much
more
for
it
than
the
processor
in
chicago
would
--
would
buy
moronts'
corn.
justice
potter
stewart
he
buy
it
--
buy
in
chicago
where
it
would've
been
subject
to
the
lower
barge
rate.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
the
grain
dealers
in
chicago?
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
--
didn't
the
--
didn't
it
show
in
the
record
that
the
railroad,
somewhere
along
the
line,
expressed
their
intention
to
broaden
this
rate
to
cover
whole
grain
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
milled
in
transit?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
barge
lines
said
that
if
they
did
that,
this
would
be
even
a
more
discriminatory
case.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
--
against
the
barge
lines,
as
i
understood
it,
that
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
counsel's
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you've
said
they
went
back
to
their
old
position
that
they
are
going
to.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
board
of
trade's
objection
limited
to
the
points
that
the
rate
is
restricted
to
grain
milled
in
transit
rather
than
grain
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
but
here,
the
objection
is
based
upon
the
rates
restriction
to
grain
milled
in
transit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
telling
us
that
this
is
--
this
objection
is
interrelated
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
understand
that
the
commission
concluded
that
the
5.5-cent
rate
was
compensatory.
i
thought
its
conclusion
was
that
the
overall
rate
from
the
belt
line
station
to
west
of
kankakee
to
the
east
was
compensatory.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
i
thought
that
was
what
the
--
concluded
about.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
you
point
out
in
your
brief,
that
reasoning
would
also
support
a
rate
of
zero
between
the
west
of
kankakee.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
course
it
is.
but
am
i
not
right
that
the
commission
didn't
think
that
this
--
that
the
--
i
couldn't
remember
the
terms
of
ours,
but
the
term
--
but
the
part
of
the
rate
between
west
of
kankakee
and
kankakee
was
what
have
to
be
considered
but
rather
the
overall
rate.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
by
this,
isn't
it?
it's
uncontroverted
in
the
record,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
the
elevator
operators
or
the
processes
along
the
belt
line
are
--
don't
have
any
advantage
out
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
applicable
for
chicago
via
kankakee
as
well
as
for
chicago
back
to
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
and
from
--
it's
also
54
now
59.5-cent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rate
from
kankakee
so
that
could
be
via
chicago
or
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
there
--
is
there
east-west
line
going
--
i
suppose
there
is,
it
shows
that
there
is
in
the
(inaudible)to
kankakee.
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
make
it
a
--
a
special
case
as
the
statute
says.
