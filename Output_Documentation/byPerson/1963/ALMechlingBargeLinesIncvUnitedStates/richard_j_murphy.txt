mr.
richard
j.
murphy
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
this
court.
i
represent
the
new
york
central
railroad
company,
the
appellant
in
this
proceeding.
in
the
argument
and
in
the
briefs,
the
mechling
barge
lines
asserts
that
our
rates
are
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition
and
they
raised
the
question
that
the
commission
carried
in
so
finding.
this
question
is
one
of
the
two
principal
questions
presented
under
the
4
section.
mr.
justice
black
suggested
that
this
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rates
are
lower
than
necessary
to
compete
was
a
pivotal
question
and
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
the
competitive
issue
raised
by
mechling
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
having
dominated
the
hearing
before
the
commission.
with
the
appellant
mechling
and
others
suggesting
that
the
rates
should
be
as
much
as
13
cents,
100
pounds
higher
than
our
present
rates.
35
witnesses
testified
at
the
hearing.
31
of
which
testified
in
respect
to
the
competitive
issue.
and
with
this
emphasis
placed
on
the
case,
it's
not
surprising
that
a
major
portion
of
the
commission's
report
here
deals
with
the
competitive
aspect
of
the
case
and
deals
with
the
subsidiary
findings
and
discussion
of
facts
that
led
to
the
commission's
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
rates
are
not
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
the
competition.
the
line
of
the
new
york
central,
west
of
kankakee,
and
the
barge
line
in
the
illinois
river
serve
a
common
territory.
this
area
is
one,
which
insofar
as
deserved
by
the
new
york
central,
is
an
area
that
we
can
only
handle
corn
or
grain
out
of
it.
the
commission
made
a
finding
that
our
principal
business
at
those
stations
is
grain,
preponderantly
corn,
that's
at
record
13.
now,
while
this
origin
territory
is
reached
by
and
served
by
both
the
barge
lines
and
the
railroad,
there
was
no
competition
between
the
two
routes.
the
all-rail
route
from
moronts,
for
example,
to
the
east
via
kankakee
versus
the
barge
rail
route
to
chicago
and
then
east
by
rail.
the
commission
did
find
that
at
one
time,
all
of
the
corn
move
via
the
all-rail
route
but
with
the
development
of
the
illinois
river,
the
corn
left
the
rails
and
move
via
this
barge
route.
mr.
spencer
referred
to
a
figure
of
270
carloads
of
corn
as
having
moved
in
1956
and
45
carloads
of
corn
has
--
is
having
moved
in
57.
the
record
doesn't
explain
the
unusual
figure
for
1956
but
it
was
the
1955
previous
are
record
--
are
of
record
and
the
movement
was
less
than
a
hundred
carloads
during
the
entire
year
from
those
17
stations.
when
the
all-rail
routes
lost
the
business
to
the
barge
lines,
the
small
businesses
along
the
new
york
central
on
this
line
from
kankakee
to
moronts
were
affected.
the
commission
found
that
they
ceased
the
commercial
elevation
of
corn
and
were
relegated
to
the
milling
of
corn
--
elevation
of
corn
from
milling
and
resale
locally.
there's
testimony
to
support
that
from
country
elevator
operators
who
are
located
and
have
their
businesses
along
the
line
of
the
new
york
central
which
has
testified
in
our
support.
it
was
to
correct
this
situation
and
to
put
some
business
back
in
our
railroad,
to
put
our
small
business
people
into
--
back
into
business
that
we
published
these
rates,
and
i
might
mention
that
the
record
also
shows
that
our
business
situation
down
there
was
so
serious
that
we
gave
consideration
to
abandonment
of
a
portion
of
that
line.
again,
referring
to
this
important
issue
before
the
commission,
the
commission's
ultimate
finding
that
the
rates
are
no
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition
is
based
on
three
different
types
of
proofs
to
that
fact.
first
of
these
is
the
effect
of
the
rates
in
the
movement
of
traffic.
as
these
rates
were
in
effect
before
the
year
prior
to
the
commission
hearing,
the
commission
had
evidence
based
on
the
traffic
experience
under
the
actual
competitive
conditions
created
by
these
rates,
which
mechling
contends
are
so
low
its
to
be
distractive.
on
that
--
fortunately
and
admittedly,
the
1957
corn
crop
was
a
good
one.
the
barge
business
increased
in
chicago
to
an
excess
of
34
million
tons
in
total
into
approximately
27
million
tons
--
excuse
me,
bushels,
from
these
ten
competitive
ports
to
chicago.
the
rail
movement
from
these
17
stations
between
moronts
and
kankakee
in
total
was
5,362,000
bushels
on
which
more
than
20%
or
more
than
a
million
bushels
moved
for
export
on
rates
that
were
five
to
seven
cents
lower
than
those
that
are
a
sale
is
being
destructive
and
non-compensatory.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
it's
been
pointed
out.
this
record
has
been
closed
a
long
time.
the
figure
of
some
16
million
tons
that
was
mentioned
by
mr.
hayes
this
morning
was
also
mentioned
in
the
reply
brief
which
was
filed
yesterday.
that
was
the
first
time
that
i
saw
those
figures.
i
have
no
access
to
them,
i've
never
seen
or
heard
them
before
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
whether
or
not
they
are
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
also,
i'm
not
prepared
to
--
to
say
what
the
rail
movement
was
during
1963
either.
it
may
be
that
all
of
our
business
went
to
part.
maybe
that
there
was
some
tremendous
change
that
i'm
not
aware
of
and
i
--
i
don't
say
that
i
don't
believe
mr.
hayes
but
i
have
no
way
of
arguing
against
the
fact
that
i
don't
know
anything
about.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
a
three
year
period
is
about
this
representative
as
we're
aware
of,
your
honor.
the
figures
--
we
have
--
the
figure
for
1956
was
26
million
bushels
of
corn
to
chicago.
1957,
as
i
stated,
was
a
good
year.
there
were
34
million
bushels
of
corn
to
chicago.
the
record
does
show
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
on
the
barges,
yes.
in
1956,
the
new
--
the
rail
movement
from
these
stations
was
less
than
a
million
bushels
and
that
was
almost
all
government
corn
for
export
that
moved
on
lower
rates
than
those
involved
here.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
the
only
figures
that
i
have
--
any
knowledge
i
have,
your
honor,
are
the
figures
of
record.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
the
rail
movement
during
1957
on
the
rates
involved
here
was
approximately
4
million
bushels.
contrasted
which
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
the
object
of
our
asking
for
the
decreased
rate
was
to
permit
us
to
meet
the
competition
at
the
barge
lines.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
--
i
say
maybe
with
good
intentions,
i'd
say
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
it
was.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
if
it
were
demonstrated
on
the
record
that
the
barge
rail
route
with
a
low
cost
route,
lower
cost
in
the
all-rail
route.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
and
that
the
new
york
central
was
going
to
lose
money
as
a
result
of
this
rate
publication,
my
answer
is
no,
we
should
not
be
permitted
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
but
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
your
honor,
i
get
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
i
might
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
i
might
--
might
say,
your
honor,
that
on
this
question
of
destructive
competition
as
raised
by
the
barge
line,
i
think
that
the
whole
report
or
the
--
the
most
of
this
report
deals
with
this
competitive
question.
i
don't
think
that
mr.
hayes
has
really
much
of
an
argument
about
the
compartmentalization
of
the
pleading
argument
that's
raised
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
the
argument
of
the
commission,
as
i
understand
it,
was
in
response
to
an
argument
of
the
board
of
trade
and
an
argument
of
the
department
of
justice
which
supports
the
board
of
trade.
mr.
hayes,
he
had
his
day
in
court
in
full.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes.
well,
mr.
hayes,
when
he
argued
here,
he
was
not
only
arguing
in
support
of
the
barge
line,
he
was
raising
an
issue
of
some
grain
merchants
which
are
--
are
represented
very
ably
by
mr.
spencer.
in
that
case,
mr.
hayes
was
presenting
two
arguments
but
i
--
i
think
it
should
be
clear
here
that
the
barge
line
had
its
full
day
before
the
commission.
the
commission
in
determining
that
these
rates
were
no
lower
than
necessary
to
compete
with
the
barge
rail
route
a
full
consideration
to
mr.
--
both
in
the
evidence
and
procedurally,
to
mr.
hayes'
contentions.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
we
also
prove
that
this
was
compensatory
to
the
railroads.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
we
did
prove
that
as
well
as
proving
that
the
rates
are
not
lower
than
necessary
to
compete.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
what
i
do
--
no,
i
do
not
make
the
argument
in
those
words.
i'd
like
to
state
to
myself
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
what
we
argue
is
that
under
the
decision
in
new
haven
verse
or
interstate
commerce
commission
versus
new
haven
decided
by
this
court
last
term
in
which
you
construed
section
15
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
and
define
destructive
competition.
you
--
this
court
said
that
a
carrier
cannot
put
in
a
rate
if
by
so
doing,
it's
going
to
destroy
the
business
and
the
rate
structure
of
a
lower
cost
carrier
who
would
thereby
be
forced
to
reduce
its
rate
and
possibly
be
seriously
injured.
that
was
the,
as
i
understand
it,
rough
understanding
of
the
definition
of
destructive
competition.
in
that
case,
this
court
also
said
that
the
burden
of
establishing
and
proving
destructive
competition
rest
on
the
party
who
claims
to
have
that
inherent
advantage.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
we
could
be
permitted
to
put
in
a
rate
that
was
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition.
now,
when
we
just
go
down
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
the
congress'
regulation
is
almost
all
embraced
upon
this
subject.
but
i
might
say
this,
your
honor,
when
the
commission
found
that
our
rate
was
no
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition,
implicit
in
that
is
a
finding
that
it
isn't
too
low
to
meet
the
competition
and
thereby,
that
it
won't
--
could
the
barge
lines
out
of
business.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
the
facts
they
raised
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
it
was
cut
to
5.5
cents,
the
--
the
rate
to
take
the
mass
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
so
that
we're
not
concerned
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
--
about
the
change.
if
the
rate
from
moronts
to
kankakee
was
25
cents
a
100
pounds,
the
rate
from
--
the
proportional
rate
from
kankakee
to
new
york
was
54
cents.
the
proportional
rate
that
was
established
which
applies
only
on
corn
that
moves
to
destination
beyond
kankakee
and
is
milled
in
transit
in
a
destination
at
a
point
prior
to
that
destination
is
5.5
cents
making
the
through
combination
charge
from
moronts
to
new
york,
59.5
cents,
as
distinguished
from
a
rate
of
72
cents
from
kankakee
to
new
york.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
not
under
section
4
of
interstate
commerce
act
which
prevents
this
from
raising
the
rate
if
we
manage
to
put
barge
line
out
of
business
but
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
--
from
my
knowledge
of
history,
we'd
never
been
--
we'd
never
done
that.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
your
honor,
the
only
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
that
--
that
was
mr.
goodman's
argument.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
he
is
correct
in
that.
we
--
we
do
not
state
that
we're
generating
any
greater
demand
for
corn
in
the
east.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
we
--
we
--
that
is
our
purpose
and
that
is
our
intention
and
that's
--
that
was
our
experience
under
this
rate.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
both,
your
honor.
we
--
we
were
handling
partially
none
from
moronts
to
kankakee.
we
got
some
business
there.
we
also
increase
their
movement,
our
total
through
movement
too.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
it
went
from
--
from
chicago.
it
went
from
chicago
when
the
barge
lines
brought
it
to
chicago.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
we
have
rail
competition
and
i
think
competition
is
quite
pervasive
in
the
whole
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
--
i
don't
understand
that
it's
--
it's
really
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
there
are
also
millers
in
indianapolis
where
we
are
getting
some
this
way
too
so
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
that
is
the
thing.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
they
can
get
it
and
process
it.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
no,
your
honor,
they
can
process
it
in
chicago
with
no
rate
disadvantage
whatsoever.
they
have
the
same
rights
as
kankakee.
the
fact
is
that
chicago
is
a
grain
terminal
with
large
merchant
elevators,
there's
not
much
milling
done
there.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
what
mr.
spencer
is
concerned
about
is
this
competition
between
the
chicago
merchants
and
the
people
who
actually
use
the
corn.
it's
--
he's
arguing
for
the
middleman
on
the
board
of
trade
which
is
perfectly
proper.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
the
commission
--
i
--
i
disagree
with
the
suggestion
that
the
commission
found
what
this
cost
worth.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
present
evidence
on
that
proposition.
the
only
one
that
presented
evidence
on
that
proposition
with
mr.
hayes'
file
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
we
could
have.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
he
cross-examine
his
witness
and
we
disagree
with
him
but
we
did
not
try
to
rebut
or
prove
this
because
we
didn't
consider
that
that
was
an
issue
in
this
particular
case
for
the
reason
that
it's
the
through
charges
that
were
involved.
now,
in
that
connection,
there
was
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
--
that's
the
part
of
the
rail
route
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
--
that's
competitive
with
the
barge
route.
i've
readily
concede
that.
but
there's
no
finding
by
the
commission,
i
submit,
that
this
--
that
the
rail
cost
from
moronts
to
kankakee
exceed
the
5.5-cent
rate.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
what
the
commission
held.
and
when
--
when
mr.
hayes
presented
his
evidence
on
that
point,
we
cross-examined
his
witness
but
we
didn't
go
into
it.
we
didn't
feel
that
it
was
substantial
evidence
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
we
think
we
make
money
on
the
rate
by
itself
west
of
kankakee
and
in
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
--
what?
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
we
--
we
think
our
costs
are
less
than
5.5
cents
that
they're
talking
about
but
we
didn't
put
in
a
cost
study
to
rebut
what
they
put
in
two
pages.
our
two
sheets
of
paper,
each
one
of
them
label
is
a
separate
exhibit
which
purport
to
be
a
cost
study.
the
witness,
i
asked
him,
he'd
never
been
to
kankakee,
he'd
never
been
in
that
territory,
he'd
never
studied
the
operations,
he
made
some
assumptions
and
applied
some
average
statistics
to
them
and
said,
“this
is
the
cost.”
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
your
honor.
i
think
they
recited
the
evidence.
the
examiner
found
it
and
the
commission
struck
from
this
report,
the
finding
and
conclusion
of
the
examiner
and
merely
left
the
recitation
of
what
the
evidence
showed
in
and
the
full
paragraph
includes
the
statement
that
protest
to
this
witness
submitted
thus
and
so.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
correct
but
i
--
i
submit
that
the
--
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
that
the
rate
was
--
as
to
what
the
cost
worth.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
i
--
i
take
a
little
stronger
position
than
--
than
the
commission
takes
on
--
on
that.
section
4
says
that
the
commission
may,
in
a
special
case
and
if
the
rates
are
compensatory,
grant
relief
from
what
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
discrimination
i.e.
the
charging
of
a
higher
rate
for
a
--
shorter
than
a
longer
included
hall.
that's
all
of
the
statute
requires.
it
was
that
relief
that
we
asked
and
it
was
that
--
our
application
that
was
set
down
for
hearing.
now,
while
the
commission
may
have
discretion
to
enlarge
its
hearing,
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
they
don't
have
it,
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
that
requires
them
to
enlarge
the
hearing
and
consider
other
issues.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
i
--
i
disagree
with
the
analysis
of
those.
i
think
there
were
16
cases
that
mr.
spencer
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well,
there
were
more
than
enough
as
far
as
i
was
concern
but
we
analyzed
those
cases.
a
large
number
of
those
cases
were
investigation
cases
instituted
under
section
15,
which
are
generally
investigations
in
which,
admittedly,
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates
under
all
aspects
are
--
at
issue.
a
number
of
them
were
complaint
cases.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
a
number
of
them
were
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
there
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
there
was
--
a
substantial
number
of
them
were
4
section
cases,
your
honor,
but
they
were
not
necessarily
just
terminated
by
this
issue
because
a
lot
of
them,
the
relief
was
granted
and
the
commission's
recitation
of
what
it
might
do
if
some
violation
occurred,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
particularly
meaningful.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
would
characterize
it
as
dicta.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
the
section
4
relief
was
granted.
and
in
that
--
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
relief
was
denied
but
the
unlawfulness
or
prejudice
occurred
at
the
intermediate
origin
because
the
competitive
conditions
existing
at
the
more
distant
point
were
also
present
at
the
intermediate
origin
therefore,
there
was
no
special
case.
but
i
--
think
they
were
about
three
cases,
and
mr.
spencer
correctly
states
that
in
his
reply
brief
where
there
were
violations
an
--
other
than
the
direct
routes.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
no,
i
say
the
--
well,
they
have
a
right
to
consider
and
i
would
not
say
that
they
have
no
right
to
consider.
but
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
consider
it
or
discretion
to
consider
it.
i
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
real
well
entrenched
administrative
practice
that
says
they
will
in
all
instances
consider
it.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
well
first,
on
reducing
the
rate
from
23
to
5.5,
we
might
as
well
reduce
it
from
$1
to
5.5
cents
because
we
weren't
getting
the
business
from
the
23,
it
was
virtually
a
noncompetitive
paper
rate.
we
did
establish
that
we
--
all
this
--
the
distance
from
here
to
here
is
an
average
of
38
miles.
the
distance
from
chicago
to
kankakee
is
75
miles.
over
and
a
half
holds
a
little
shorter
distance.
also,
this
is
a
rural
area
and
we
had
a
witness,
mr.
reynolds
who
testified
in
respect
the
operating
conditions
here
and
here.
he
testified
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
expensive
--
expensive
operation
here.
also,
we
had
the
absorption
of
switching
charges
in
the
congested
chicago
terminal.
so
we
cut
off
about
2
cents
of
the
expense
that
we
had
to
pay
out
to
get
5.5
cents
more
money
for
handling
it
from
here
to
here
and
then
to
new
york
and
we
did
it
from
here
to
here
and
then
to
new
york.
we
avoided
a
2-cent
loss
or
a
pay
out
that
put
a
7.5
cents
ahead,
shorter
distance
less
expensive
operation.
we
think
that
we
test
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
unfortunately,
we
have
not
been
carrying
the
rate
under
23-cent
rate
because
we
were
noncompetitive,
your
honors.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
we
had
the
rate
--
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
45
cars
in
an
entire
year
from
17
stations
which
is
virtually
no
business.
they
--
i
don't
know
why
they
came
--
you're
always
going
to
get
a
little
bit
so
--
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
it's
a
--
it's
a
good
reduction.
i
might
say
that
if
the
railroads
can't
make
practical
reductions
in
what
are
otherwise
noncompetitive
rates,
we
will
be
having
a
very
serious
time.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
i
--
i
do.
and
i
--
i
do
stand
or
fall
under
the
4
section
on
that
proposition
and
the
destructive
competition.
i
think
you'd
have
to
consider
these
other
factors.
but
in
considering
the
compensativeness
of
the
rates
under
section
4,
i
think
you
must
necessarily
look
at
the
true
charges
and
i
noticed
that
the
department
of
justice
agrees
with
us
on
that
proposition.
mr.
richard
j.
murphy
yes,
your
honor.
oh,
no,
no,
not
on
the
destructive
competition.
i
think
on
the
destructive
competition,
you
have
to
look
at
about
10
different
points.
and
in
--
look
at
these
cost
saving
effects
that
we
have
in
here.
you've
got
to
--
to
look
at
the
fact
that
the
commission
found
that
these
rates
are
no
lower
than
necessary
to
compete.
again,
look
at
the
fact
that
the
barge
line
increased
its
rate
a
year
after
these
reductions
became
effective.
and
i
think
that
when
the
barge
line
claiming
before
the
commission
that
it's
going
to
be
destroyed,
goes
ahead
and
in
the
face
of
our
competitive
rate,
increases
its
rate,
it's
something
that
argues
against
a
factor
of
destructive
competition.
i
might
mention
that
very
little
of
our
corn
from
kankakee
to
moronts
goes
through
cincinnati,
although
it's
a
work
of
a
route.
i
believe
that's
--
i
believe
that
just
about,
it
concludes
all
i
can
cover.
thank
you,
your
honors.
