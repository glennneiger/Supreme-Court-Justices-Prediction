mr.
edward
b.
hayes
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
these
are
appeals
in
order
of
the
district
court
sustaining
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
order
grants
permanent
authorization
to
the
eastern
railroads
upon
their
joint
application
as
a
group
to
charge
less
for
a
longer
hauls
of
corn.
corn
from
this
northeastern
illinois
producing
area,
west
of
chicago
and
kankakee
to
the
east,
less
for
that
longer
haul,
then
they
charged
contemporaneously
for
the
shorter
rail
hauls
of
light
corn
from
origins
east
of
chicago
and
kankakee
in
a
four-state
area.
this
green
line
represents
a
waterway
used
by
barges.
this
short
red
line
here
is
the
competitive
rail
haul,
the
so-called
"belt
line"
of
the
new
york
central
which
is
one
of
the
eastern
railroad
applicants.
east
of
chicago
and
kankakee,
the
eastern
railroads
have
no
barge
line
competition.
all
those
rate,
defining
from
the
four-section,
applies
only
to
corn
milled
in
transit,
that
is
to
say
only
to
corn
which
is
milled
into
products
at
some
stock
off
point
before
delivering
to
its
final
eastern
destination.
it
is
separately
published
reshipping
rate
on
this
milled
in
transit
corn
east
of
kankakee
and
east
of
chicago
was
not
affected.
there
is
no
change
in
that
under
this
order.
that
rate
is
the
same
whether
the
corn
be
milled
--
to
be
milled
in
transit
and
goes
east
from
chicago
or
east
from
kankakee.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
that
reshipping
rate
to
all
eastern
destinations
is
based
on
the
shipping
rate
from
chicago
and
kankakee
to
new
york.
as
you
point
out,
it
was
49
cents
a
hundred
rate
originally.
while
the
proceeding
was
pending
under
uniform
general
countrywide
rail
rate
increases
on
most
products,
it
became
a
higher
sum
--
i
forgotten
what
this,
i
think
around
54
cents.
in
the
record
and
briefs,
it
is
sometimes
identified
as
the
49.5-cent
rate
sometimes
is
the
--
at
the
other
figure.
there
is
no
change
in
that
rate
under
the
railroads
proposal
and
under
the
order
here
in
question.
however,
speaking
of
it,
i
should
say
for
clarity
that
it
is
the
same
reshipping
rate
all
the
way
through
new
york,
whether
the
corn
milled
in
transit
goes
directly
to
new
york
by
one
of
the
direct
lines
of
other
railroads
schematically
indicated
by
this
blue
or
by
some
indirect
route,
this
red
is
new
york
central.
the
blue
is
other
railroads.
it's
always
--
just
that
sum
all
the
way
through
to
new
york,
no
matter
how
it
goes
there.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
this
is
on
corn
milled
in
transit,
your
honor,
so
it
has
to
have
a
stop
off
point
and
one
of
the
primary
stop
off
points
is
kankakee.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
there
is
another
one
in
chicago
but
in
chicago,
the
demand
for
grain
is
quite
largely
for
whole
corn
because
there,
there
are
marketers
of
whole
corn
and
this
is
a
processor
down
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
oh,
yes,
it
stops
off
and
--
in
the
east
also,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
--
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
it
can
be
stopped
off
from
mechling,
sir,
at
any
point
in
the
whole
route
at
any
point
provided
it
is
milled
into
products
before
it
gets
to
final
destination.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
it
always
has
to
be,
your
honor,
in
order
--
in
order
to
take
this
rate.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
as
i
say,
from
kankakee
and
chicago,
it's
the
49.5-cent
rate
all
the
way
to
new
york
no
matter
how
it
gets
there.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
oh,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
this
very
indirect
route
that
a
very
large
part
of
this
corn
went
on
and
under
the
findings
rather
than
on
the
direct
route
through.
now,
as
i've
said
in
this
application
and
orderly
that
eastern
reshipping
rate
unchanged
the
new
rate
that
the
railroads
published
and
the
commission
authorized
was
a
new
rail
rate
from
moronts
to
kankakee
on
the
barge
competitive
inbound
haul.
it
was
also
a
rate
where
the
same
sum
of
5.5-cent
that
would
apply
in
kankakee
and
for
that
also
go
through
the
chicago.
but
the
chicago
grain
marketers
can't
use
it
because
it's
confined
to
whole
corn
except
in
various
small
parts.
there
are
about
45
cars
hereafter
the
--
with
--
went
into
effect
did
go
via
chicago.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
oh,
forgive
me.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
barge
rate
was
about
4.7
cents,
a
little
less.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
that's
true.
however,
it
is
necessary
in
order
for
any
carrier
of
grain
to
operate
to
draw
grain
from
the
country
markets.
and
i
will
come
to
that
point
if
i
may.
the
rate
had
been,
prior
to
this,
23.5
cents
from
moronts
to
kankakee
and
18
cents
from
the
closest
point
to
kankakee.
and
the
--
the
new
rate
for
the
service
performed
up
to
kankakee
was
a
flat
rate,
as
i
said,
of
5.5
cents,
originally
5
cents
--
5.5
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
was
generated
increasing.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
the
evidence
showed,
as
the
commission
found,
that
the
average
for
a
distributed
cost
of
the
railroad
for
the
service
performed
up
to
kankakee
and
even
for
the
service
performed
and
it
went
all
the
way
to
chicago.
but
the
cost
they're
talking
about
is
the
service
only
up
to
kankakee
that
if
that
other
route
--
where
it's
not
5.5
cents
but
the
further
distributed
rail
cost
for
the
service
from
moronts
to
kankakee
was
14,
33,
100
cents
at
that
time
for
loadings
of
50
tons
a
car
and
still
13.5
cents
if
they
got
another
5
tons
on
the
cars,
they
claimed
they
often
did.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
record.
that's
--
that's
on
page
26
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
only
evidence
on
that
was
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
the
evidence
which
we
produced.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
the
only
evidence.
they
made
no
cost.
they
presented
no
evidence
on
cost,
that
the
whole
evidence
on
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
the
commission
said,
and
let
--
let's
--
as
to
what's
the
commission
said
is
in
the
record
if
i
may
read
it
at
record,
i
think
that's
26,
yes.
we
--
as
i
--
as
i've
said,
we
put
in
the
evidence.
that's
the
whole
evidence.
for
1956,
mechling's
operating
ratio
is
91
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
it's
at
page
26
of
the
record,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
for
1956,
mechling's
operation
was
91.9%,
its
average
fully
distributed
cost
for
the
transportation
of
car
from
the
six
most
competitive
points
to
chicago
was
so
many
mills
or
4.4
cents
per
100
pounds
which
is
the
comparable
figure.
these
expenses
are
about
10
cents
less
than
the
new
york
central's
average
fully
distributed
cost
of
14.33
and
13.57
per
100
pounds
on
50-ton
and
55-ton
loads
respectively
for
46.4
miles
computed
by
the
protesters.
according
to
mechling,
this
difference
of
approximately
10
cents
represents
its
inherent
low
cost
advantage
which
must
be
preserved.
now,
the
commission
didn't
dispute
that
evidence.
this
is
what
it
said,
"the
barge
carrier
is
not
entitled
under
the
transfer
--
under
the
act
to
have
its
rates
protected
from
a
competing
mode
of
transportation
whereas
in
this
instance,
the
railroad's
efforts
to
secure
traffic
do
not
amount
to
a
destructive
competitive
practice."
i
submit
that
was
the
finding.
it
is
the
only
finding
the
commission
could
make
because
that
was
the
whole
evidence,
mr.
justice
white.
all
the
fact
of
the
railroad's
fully
distributed
cost
compared
to
the
barge
line's
fully
distributed
cost.
even
as
to
bare
out-of-pocket
railroad
cost
for
the
service
performed
this
--
when
this
5.5
cent
charge
is
published.
the
simple
average
cost
of
the
50-ton
loads,
the
commission
says
on
the
preceding
page
with
the
same
qualification
that
we
put
in
the
evidence
and
that
was
all
the
evidence
that
was,
a
50
to
a
range
up
to
9.66
cents
instead
of
5.5.
and
on
the
weighted
average
with
the
extra
5
tons
was
between
8.56
and
8.57.
that's
on
page
25
of
the
record.
now,
this
evidence
in
the
commission's
findings
that
it
is
the
evidence
that
is
flat
finding
that
there
is
the
fact
so
far
as
the
fully
distributed
cost
are
concerned
which
i
first
read,
completely
exploded
the
claim
on
which
the
railroads
relied
at
the
hearing
that
new
5.5
cent
rail
rate
was
a
reasonably
compensative
charge
for
the
service
performed.
these
below
cost
what
a
competitive
rail
rate
produced
a
heavy
diversion
of
corn
from
the
barge
of
the
rail
whose
earlier
stages
are
described
that,
in
our
brief,
diversion
has
continued
so
that
from
over
34
million
bushels
to
chicago
by
barge
in
1957,
the
first
year,
the
new
rail
rate
was
in
effect.
the
barge
go
on
traffic
to
chicago
had
flown
by
1963
to
only
16
million
to
54
pounds
are
less
than
half
according
to
the
1963
statistics
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade.
but
we
brought
in
mind
that
the
below-cost
5.5-cent
rail
charge
applied
only
to
that
part
of
the
traffic
that
is
milled
in
transit.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i'm
reading
from
my
notes.
my
notes
are
--
reflect
the
decision
of
the
--
the
form
of
the
tariff
which
restricts
this
rate
to
corn
milled
in
transit
as
i
earlier
described.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
rate
to
moronts
was
--
from
moronts
to
kankakee
was
23
cents.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
mechanics
of
this
rate
are
explained
in
our
briefs.
they
are
complicated.
i
will
make
them
just
as
short
and
simple
as
i
possibly
can.
that's
the
trouble
with
these
rate
cases.
the
tariffs
are
so
complicated.
this
is
the
effect
that
i've
stated.
what
they
did
when
this
grain
started
out
from
moronts
was
charged
the
ordinary
23-cent
rate
and
collect
it
whether
it
went
to
kankakee
or
chicago.
and
then
they
would
charge
when
it
went
on
the
full
rate
but
in
the
end,
when
you
came
to
settle
with
the
railroad,
you
would
receive
from
the
railroad,
i'm
talking
about
the
shipper
now,
a
credit
because
it
was
corn
milled
in
transit
and
the
ultimate
settlement
reflected
these
charges
which
i
have
described.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
49.5
cents.
the
rate
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
5.5
cents
plus
the
reshipping
rate
which
the
latter
being
unchanged.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
well,
i
would
be
making
an
argument
which
i
will
come
to
if
i
may
because
of
the
deficients
involved
under
the
aero
transportation
case.
in
other
words,
it's
not
merely
the
published
right
even
if
it
is
a
single
factor
rate
such
as
your
honor
suggests
that
is
decisive
with
respect
to
the
proportional
right
--
rates
that
are
to
be
regarded
when
you
have
these
inter
--
carrier
forms
of
competition.
it
is
the
actual
get
of
the
railroads
which
is
not
to
publish
rate
but
which
is
the
division.
and
so
far
as
we
know,
the
published
--
the
division
up
--
occurred
only
up
here
at
chicago
when
they
took
it
from
moronts
to
kankakee
to
chicago.
then
the
new
york's
--
then
the
line,
if
it
was
another
line
in
the
new
york
central,
they
took
it
on
east
as
they
says
--
and
did
happen.
the
eastern
line
--
eastern
carrier
picked
back
to
new
york
central
without
any
published
tariff
on
it,
13
cents
out
of
that
rate.
look
at
the
consequence
of
that.
the
consequence
is
that
the
actual
remuneration
of
the
eastern
carrier
when
it
took
this
rail-arrived
grain
to
chicago
was
--
then
got
29
cents
for
that
service,
less
13
cents,
only
the
difference,
what
is
--
26
--
36.5-cent.
but
when
it
was
barge-arrived
grain
in
chicago,
the
eastern
carrier
got
the
full
49.5
cents.
the
consequence
of
which
is
that
the
--
under
this
rate,
the
eastern
carrier
is
moving
rail-arrived
grain
to
the
east
for
13
cents
less.
then
it
gets
--
when
it
moves
barge-arrived
grain
to
chicago
to
the
east
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
condemn
in
the
first
mechling
case.
i
hope
--
other
diversion
from
the
barge
lines
to
the
rails
has
continued
as
i
said
that
we
bear
in
mind
that
so
far
as
the
only
milling
in
transit
under
a
tariff.
and
in
the
companion
--
if
this
rate
were
extended
so
as
to
apply
to
the
whole
traffic,
goes
that
which
moves
by
--
moves
from
milling
in
transit
that
which
doesn't,
well,
then
the
barge
lines
wouldn't
be
competitive
for
any
of
it
for
this
origin.
and
the
examiner
found
that
that
would
mean
the
extinction
of
barge-rail
transportation.record
50
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
this
new
rate
applies
only
to
that
part
of
the
traffic
which
is
milled
in
transit.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
because
if
this
rate
were
now
extended
so
as
to
apply
to
whole
corn
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
correct.
then
the
barge
--
this
new
below-cost
rate
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
would
apply
to
the
whole
traffic
and
not
just
part
of
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
the
railroads
would
cease
to
be
competitive
as
to
the
whole
traffic.
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
large
signs
would
cease
to
be
competitive
as
to
the
whole
traffic
instead
of
just
the
milled
in
transit
part
which
would
spell
the
extinction
of
the
barge
carry,
as
the
examiner
found
at
record
50.
and
as
the
commission
ignored
on
the
proposition
that
it
didn't
have
to
determine
the
board
of
trade's
point
which
is
precisely
that
for
this
rate
to
continue
in
existence
legally,
without
a
discrimination
against
the
whole
corn
marketers
in
chicago,
it
has
to
be
made
applicable
to
whole
corn.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
5.5
cents
plus
49.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
55
cents.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
you've
just
stated
it.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
there
is
no
single
factor
rate.
the
sellers
are
entirely
on
this
combination.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
you
see
the
barge
doesn't
go
to
kankakee.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
overall
rate
of
the
barge
lines
is
slightly
less.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
barge
from
--
from
moronts
to
new
york,
like
that?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
it
is
the
barge
rate
of,
i
think,
4.7
plus
49.5
whereas,
as
i
just
pointed
out
in
connection
with
justice
white's
question,
the
actual
receipts
of
the
railroad
from
chicago
to
new
york
in
view
of
the
division,
which
is
what
they
really
got
and
counts
on
the
transportation
rates,
is
only
36.5
cents
when
the
corn
comes
in
like
this.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
i
thought
i
was.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
examiner's
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
because
--
that's
the
point
that
was
earlier
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
which
i
asked
permission
to
come
to,
i'll
come
to
it
now.
the
reason
is
that
in
order
to
maintain
barge
traffic,
you
can't
live
on
the
grain
that
is
grown
right
next
to
the
elevator
within
one
mile
of
the
elevator
as
one
of
the
witnesses
said
was
what
the
barge
was
getting
under
this
new
rate.
a
barge
is
a
big
thing,
not
like
a
box
cart.
you
need
large
scale
transportation
to
realize
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
of
water
transportation.
and
when
you
dilute
the
traffic
of
the
barge
line,
the
unit
cost
go
up
with
the
consequence
that
you
are
to
that
degree
sacrificing
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
of
water
transportation
and
if
you
don't
let
the
barge
lines
draw
for
their
necessarily
large
movement,
these
are
sub-terminal
elevators
on
the
river,
draw
enough
to
support
a
vessel
movement
as
compared
to
a
movement
a
car
at
a
time.
barges
can't
live.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
sir,
the
traffic
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
has
dropped
from
34
million
bushels
to
chicago
in
1957
to
only
a
little
over
16
million
in
1963.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
pardon?
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
we're
still
--
we're
still
competitive
as
to
whole
corn.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
let
me
come
straight.
i
understand
your
question.
that's
the
same
question
you
asked
before.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
is,
and
i'm
glad
i'm
i
have
another
opportunity
to
answer
if
i
didn't
satisfy
you,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
it
must
be
allowed
to
this
barge
rate
to
draw
traffic
from
an
area
which
reflects
the
difference
determined
by
its
inherent
low
cost
advantage
if
it
is
to
continue
to
survive.
it
cannot
survive
on
the
grain
that
is
drawn
within
a
mile
of
the
elevator.
its
inherent
low
cost
advantage
is
10
cents.
and
if
the
railroad
by
a
non-compensatory
below
cost
charge
can
reduce
that
advantage
impartially,
it
can,
to
that
extent,
take
business
away
from
the
barge
lines
and
when
the
reduction
is
so
great,
because
these
5.5
cents
was
only
about
half
the
difference
in
low
cost
advantage,
in
favor
of
the
barge
lines,
it
was
only
a
fraction
of
the
railroads
actual
cost
cut
way
into
the
inherent
advantage
and
the
volume
necessary
to
support
a
barge
movement
can't
move
to
the
barges
unless
it
has
its
low
cost
advantage.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
before
these
tariffs
were
filled,
the
free
grain
went
almost
entirely
by
barge
just
as
now
after
these
tariffs
are
filed,
the
grain
is
going
progressively
by
railroad
and
that
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
was
because
of
what?
that
was
because
of
the
--
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
of
the
barge
line
was
reflected
in
the
difference
between
the
barge
rate
and
the
rail
rate.
now,
when
you
sacrifice
that
inherent
low
cost
advantage
following
the
railroad
charge
of
below-cost
rate,
then
you
reverse
the
process.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
the
railroad
charges
5.5
cents
plus
49.5
cents.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
oh,
oh,
beg
--
i
--
i'm
so
terribly
sorry.
yes,
this
rate
does
not
apply
to
low
cost.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
that's
right
--
23,
sir.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
23.5.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
the
farmer
got
a
very
slight
increase
in
price
for
his
products,
nowhere
like
--
nothing
like
the
difference
in
the
rate
and
nothing
like
the
--
the
figures
discussed.
but
the
thing
that
congress
was
aiming
at,
when
in
1920,
it
amended
section
4
so
as
to
say
that
the
commission,
in
exercising
its
authority
to
permit
departures
from
the
long-haul,
short-haul
clause,
shall
not
permit
the
establishment
of
any
charge
from
the
more
distant
point
that
is
not
compensatory
for
the
service
performed.
that
language
was
added
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
not
the
protected
immediate
shippers
who
were
fully
protected
by
the
previous
provisions
under
which
the
fourth-section
dealt
only
with
the
relationship
between
the
aggregate
intermediate
and
long-haul.
that
section
was
added
not
to
protect
intermediate
shippers
but
to
protect
water
carriers.
to
protect
water
carriers
against
what?
to
protect
water
carriers
against
exactly
the
classic
monopoly
device
by
which
competitive
below-cost
rates
are
subsidized
by
non-competitive
rates.
the
railroads
can
do
that
from
their
vast
volume
of
non-competitive
traffic,
they
can
destroy
water
traffic
and
the
thing
that
congress
pointed
out
was
what
it
was
aiming
at
was
to
keep
the
water
carriers
going
because
when
the
railroads,
by
the
employment
of
that
classic
monopoly
device,
had
destroyed
or
crippled
the
water
transportation,
then
the
rates
went
up
against
the
rail
rates
to
higher,
even
higher
points
and
this
farmer
was
not
better
off,
he
was
worse
off
than
before.
that
is
the
exact
purpose
of
that
language.
that
is
its
exact
effect.
and
to
contend,
as
my
opponents
do,
that
the
addition
of
that
new
language
with
that
precise
grammatical
meaning
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940
for
that
precise
purpose
didn't
make
any
change
in
the
previous
law
by
which
the
only
significant
thing
had
been
the
relationship
between
the
longer
and
shorter-hauls
is
to
defy
both
the
language
of
section
4
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
as
to
the
purpose
of
that
language.
i
have
only
five
minutes
left.
this
is
what
the
railroad
--
the
commission
on
the
point
that
you
raised
on
the
overall
cost.
says
--
it
says
that
the
railroads
on
this
realized
50
and
51
cents
per
--
per
car
mile
allows
this
court,
it
isn't
drivel,
it
goes
in
a
hopper
car
without
special
doors
and
so
on,
it
has
high
cost.
the
commission
also
said
that
the
per
car
mile
return
of
the
railroads
on
corn
was
from
73
to
95
cents.
now,
that
doesn't
prove
that
a
per
car
mile
return,
overall,
of
50
to
51
cents
pays
even
the
out-of-pocket
costs
for
the
whole
moment
and
if
the
commission
thought
it
then
--
it
was
its
duty
to
make
findings
that
showed
the
man
who
had
ordinary
sense,
hired
then
because
it
doesn't
on
its
face.
and
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
make
its
conclusions
plain
by
findings.
certainly
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
may
i
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
the
reason
is
that
you
have
very
different
cost
considerations,
your
honor,
which
i
could
go
into
at
length
but
which
are
not
developed
on
this
record.
and
the
commission
made
no
finding
with
respect
to
them.
the
commission
made
no
finding
whatever
as
to
the
causes
of
this
movement.
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
and
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
yes.
and
why
did
the
commission
say
--
mr.
edward
b.
hayes
--
they're
compensatory
because
the
ton
mile
earnings,
first,
the
ton
mile
earnings
are
50
--
51
cents
where
on
all
corn,
the
ton
mile
earnings
are
75
to
--
73
to
95.
that
doesn't
prove
it.
the
next
thing
they've
said
is
a
reason
for
it,
was
that
by
getting
the
most
of
the
cars
could
go
this
way,
they
avoided
going
up
here
to
chicago
for
the
marketers
and
telling
that
to
say
--
to
supply
this
shipper
or
this
one
or
this
one.
now,
i
submit,
the
fact
that
a
non-compensatory
rate
or
a
rate
whose
compensatoriness
is
in
issue
avoids
a
fairness
which
is
still
more
under
compensatory,
does
not
represent
a
reason
for
saying
that
the
new
rate
is
compensatory.
i
submit
further
that
if,
as
in
when,
this
discrimination
against
chicago
must
be
removed,
which
the
commission
refused
to
do
in
this
case
thereby
avoiding
--
facing
this,
although
the
movement
by
chicago
is
applied
for
it,
if
that
discrimination
is
removed,
then
all
these
train
will
again
go
applying
the
whole
corns.
and
they
won't
have
the
alleged
savings.
i
will
reserve
such
time
as
i
have,
i
hope
it's
at
least
three
minutes,
for
reply.
