mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
lieb,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
thank
you.
if
the
court
please,
this
is
a
section
301
action
to
compel
wiley
to
submit
to
arbitration
under
the
union's
contract
with
interscience
publishers.
interscience
and
wiley
were
technical
and
scientific
publishers.
interscience,
for
bona
fide
reasons,
had
some
--
had
merged
into
wiley
four
months
before
the
expiration
of
interscience's
contract
with
the
union.
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
the
business
of
interscience
was
combined
with
wiley,
and
the
interscience
stockholders,
under
the
merger
and
consolidation
agreement,
received
a
20%
stock
interest
in
the
wiley
company.
interscience
was
a
small
company,
and
its
clerical
workers
were
unionized.
wiley
was
a
large
much
over
company,
had
never
been
and
was
not
and
is
not
unionized.
the
interscience
contract,
which
is
sued
under,
contained
no
successor
cause,
and
the
contract,
specifically,
was
not
assumed
by
wiley
at
the
time
in
the
merger.
the
merger
took
place
on
october
2nd,
1961.
the
interscience
contract
by
its
terms
expired
on
january
31,
1962.
the
process
of
combining
the
two
businesses
was
commenced
immediately,
and
all
of
this
is
contested,
apparently,
by
the
union
in
its
brief
to
this
court
and
by
amicus.
it
was
completed
before
the
contract
expired.
and
the
record
so
indicates
if
you
look
hard
enough
for
it.
neither
at
the
time
of
the
merger
nor
thereafter,
was
any
interscience
employee
discharged,
disciplined
nor
did
any
interscience
employee
ever
asserted
nor
has
an
interscience
employee
ever
asserted
a
grievance
against
wiley.
to
this
day,
some
two
years
after
the
event,
since
this
suit
was
commenced,
we
have
no
notion.
we
have
no
idea
whether,
in
fact,
the
union
in
prosecuting
this
suit,
does,
in
fact,
represent
any
of
the
former
interscience
employees
who
are
now
members
of
the
wiley
enterprise.
this
action
was
commenced
on
january
23rd,
1962,
a
week
before
the
contract
expired,
about
four
months
after
the
merger.
the
action
was
commenced
under
our
section
90
of
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law.
the
allegation
being
that
under
the
provisions
of
section
90,
wiley,
as
a
constituent
company
to
a
merger,
was
responsible
for
the
obligations
of
the
merged
company.
the
complaint,
and
i'll
read
from
page
5,
alleges,
i'm
reading
from
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
5,
alleges
that
notwithstanding
the
merger
on
the
provisions
of
section
90
of
the
stock
corporation
law,
the
company,
since
the
consolidation,
has
failed
and
refused
to
recognize
the
validity
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
currently,
that
is
january
23rd,
a
week
before
the
contract
expired,
a
moot
question
because
no
controversies
have
arisen
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
and
beyond
january
30,
that's
an
error
in
printing,
and
beyond
january
31,
1962,
which
is
the
date
of
the
expiration
of
the
interscience
contract,
and
it's
further
alleged
that
wiley
has
failed
and
refused
to
recognize
the
property
rights
of
the
former
interscience
employees
thereunder,
that
is
under
the
contract
expiring
january
31,
a
week
hence,
and
otherwise,
beyond
january
31,
1962.
and
the
relief
that
is
demanded,
and
i
read
from
page
10
in
the
record,
is
that
the
union
asks
that
wiley,
with
whom
it
has
no
contract,
submit
to
arbitration
with
the
union
to
arbitrate
the
following
five
questions,
whether
the
seniority
rights
build
up
by
the
interscience
employees
must
be
accorded
to
the
employees
now,
that's
january
23rd,
a
week
before
the
contract
expired
and
after
january
31,
1962,
that's
after
the
contract
expired.
i
should
add
that
in
the
briefs
to
this
court,
the
position
has
taken
that
not
only
do
seniority
rights
build
up
as
of
january
31,
1962,
not
only
are
they
claimed
to
carryover
into
the
separate
wiley
enterprise,
but
it's
claimed
that
the
employees
continue
to
have
the
rights
to
build
up
additional
seniority
rights
after
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
the
second
demand
is
whether,
as
part
of
the
wage
structure
of
the
employees,
the
company,
that
is
wiley,
is
under
an
obligation
to
continue
to
make
contributions
to
the
district
65
security
and
welfare
plan
now,
january
23rd,
and
after
january
31,
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it
should
be
january
31.
that's
--
that's
our
respondents'
error
in
printing,
no
issue
on
that.
i
should
say
that
although
the
demand
is
that
the
company
continued
to
make
contributions,
wiley
never
made
contributions.
and
because
the
contributions
were
closed
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
no
further
contributions
made
following
october
2nd,
1961.
third,
whether
the
job
security
and
the
grievance
provisions
of
the
contract
between
the
parties
shall
continue
in
full
force
in
effect
and
the
briefs
make
very
clear
that
they're
talking
not
only
of
up
to
january
31,
which
of
course
is
moot,
but
thereafter,
indefinitely
and
forever
presumably.
and
finally,
dne
whether
the
company
must
obligate
itself
to
continue
liable
now
and
after
january
31,
1962,
to
severance
pay
and
to
vacation
pay.
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
briefs
that
the
claim
is
made
that
they
are
talking
of
an
accrual
of
additional
severance
pay
and
certainly
additional
vacation
pay
because
all
vacation
pay
that
had
been
earned
under
the
contract
has
always
been
paid.
with
the
exception
of
the
claim
for
the
welfare
plan
contributions
for
the
four-month
period
between
the
date
of
the
merger,
october
2nd,
1961
and
january
31,
all
of
the
now
issues,
now
and
hereafter,
are
moot.
no
controversies
have
ever
risen.
what
the
union
really
wants
to
arbitrate
is
whether
the
interscience
employees
carryover
to
the
wiley
enterprise
and
retain
permanently
wiley
work
in
the
wiley
enterprise
the
working
conditions
which
the
interscience
company
granted,
under
the
terms
of
the
expired
interscience
contract
and
which
contract,
of
course,
governed
the
interscience
enterprise.
the
case
got
into
court
and
gets
here
not
after
trial
but
on
a
sort
of
mixed
proceeding
on
the
union
moving
off
under
the
arbitration
act
and
under
section
301.
we've
assumed
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
this
is
a
section
301
action
and
therefore,
i
think
the
arbitration
act
questions
are
--are
not
in
the
case.
but
the
point
is
that
no
answer
was
filed.
the
time
to
extend
an
answer
has
been
extended
--
time
to
file
an
answer
has
been
extended
until
after
a
final
order
in
this
action.
there
was
no
trial,
case
was
heard
on
the
complaint
in
order
to
show
cause
in
the
petition
and
opposing
affidavits.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
there
was
never
a
demand
made
for
arbitration.
there
was
never
an
issue
claiming
for
arbitration.
this
complaint
was
filed
on
january
23rd
without
a
prior
filing
--
without
the
prior
service
or
making
of
a
demand
for
arbitration.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
even
had
a
--
a
demand
for
arbitration
have
been
made,
we
undoubtedly
would've
urged
that
the
claims
asserted
were
not
within
the
scope
of
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
the
contract
and
not
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
would
have
urged
that
this
is
the
decision
that
most
preliminary
have
been
made
by
the
court
because
we
would
have
urged
that
this
involves
a
question
of
the
construction
of
the
contract
but
none
of
that
happens.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
what
page
are
you
reading
from,
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
the
record
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
let
me
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
explained
myself
clearly,
sir.
the
complaint
was
filed
on
january
23rd
with
no
prior
demand
for
arbitration
having
been
made.
the
first
demand
was
contained
in
the
complaint.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
correct,
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
motion.
it
dismissed
the
application
on
two
grounds.
it
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
its
decision
that
the
wiley
--
that
the
interscience
obligation
to
arbitrate
carried
over
under
section
90,
didn't
decide
that
question.
but
it
said,
“we
deny
arbitration,
first,
because
in
our
opinion,
the
claims
that
are
sought
to
be
arbitrated
are
not
arbitrable
within
the
scope
of
the
contract.
and
secondly,
it
said,
“we
find
that
none
of
the,”
--
“i
find”,
the
judge
said,
“none
of
the
conditions
precedent
to
arbitration
have
been
complied
with.
they
have
been
totally
ignored.
there
has
been
an
abandonment
of
the
procedure.”
and
for
that
reason,
the
implication
was
dismissed.
the
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
directed
arbitration,
and
it
directed
arbitration
in
this
manner.
it
said,
"we
note
your
questions,
and
we'll
pass
them
all
off
to
the
arbitrator.
let
the
arbitrator
determine
whether
or
not
wiley
is
required
to
arbitrate
the
substantive
terms
of
the
contract.
let
the
arbitrator
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
conditions
precedent
to
arbitration
and
if
so,
whether
those
conditions
have
been
complied
with,
and
if
not,
whether
they
have
been
waived,
and
let
the
arbitrator
determine
whether
they
are
all
in
fact
vested
rights,”
so-called
living
rights
that
the
union
claims
here,
“and
let
the
arbitrator
determine
the
merits
of
that.”
consequently,
we
are
here
now
where
in
and
of
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
beg
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
your
pardon.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
think
the
--
the
agreement
--
the
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
at
least
the
majority
opinion
by
judge
medina,
is,
in
my
opinion
and
with
due
respect,
a
very
turgid
and
--
and
difficult
opinion
to
read.
on
page
90
in
the
record,
he
says,
judge
medina
says
for
the
majority
that
the
terms
of
the
agreement
contemplated
the
arbitration
of
just
such
a
dispute
or
controversy
as
the
one
before
us.
i
must
assume,
your
honors,
that
what
he
was
saying
was,
and
i
interpolate
the
form,
i
don't
find
it
on
this
page,
i
think
that
he's
saying
is
--
what
he
is
saying
is,
had
there
not
been
a
merger
and
had
this
claim
been
made
against
interscience,
where
interscience
still
an
active
company
doing
business,
we
would
find
that
these
claims
fall
within
the
scope.
i
must
come
to
that
conclusion
because
i
turn
over
to
pages
94
and
95
of
the
majority
opinion,
where
the
court
disposes
of
this
aspect
of
the
case.
and
the
court
says,
in
the
paragraph
in
--
starting
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
down
toward
the
end
of
the
fourth
line,
“we
think
and
hold
in
the
exercise
of
our
duty
to
fashion
a
rule
that
it
is
not
too
much
to
expect
and
require
this
employer
proceed
to
arbitration,
with
the
union,
to
determine
whether
the
obligation
to
arbitrate,
regarding
the
substantive
terms
of
the
contract,
survived
the
consolidation.
and
if
so,
just
what
rights
survived?”
and
so
on.
if
you'll
turn
over
to
judge
kaufman's
concurring
opinion
on
pages
110
and
111,
he
states
it
much
more
subsequently.
he
says,
and
i'm
reading
from
110,
“we
hold
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
clearly
removed
from
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
the
following
questions,
one,
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
whole,
survived
the
consolidation
of
interscience
and
wiley.
two,
if
the
agreement
did
survive,
thereby
imposing
upon
wiley
an
obligation
to
arbitrate
etcetera,
then
whether
the
union
had
to
comport
with
the
conditions
precedent.
and
three,
whether,
in
fact,
there
are
rights
to
carryover.”
and
to
make
more
certain,
what
is
certain
in
the
next
paragraph
of
his
short
opinion,
he
says,
and
i'm
reading
from
that
first
full
paragraph
at
probably
on
131,
"our
decision
today,
although
there's
no
successor
cause,
permits
the
arbitrator
to
imply
their
successor
cause,
if
under
the
circumstances,
he
thinks
the
implication
is
proper."
and
he
continues,
"it
is
this
power
to
read
the
successor
cause
into
the
collective
agreement
which
makes
wiley
a
proper
party
defendant.”
and
he
goes
on
and
says
in
which
makes
the
union
a
proper
party
plaintiff.
and
he
says
that
if
the
arbitrator
finds
that
the
contract
did
not,
in
fact,
carryover,
then
of
course,
wiley
shouldn't
have
been
sued
and
the
union
shouldn't
have
sued.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
have
no
doubt
of
it,
sir.
i
think
that
--
i
think
my
own
feeling
is
that
the
earlier
pages
in
judge
medina's
opinion
were
unclear
because
i
think
that
he
was
talking
of
an
obligation
that
he
was
finding
in
the
interscience
contract.
but
then
at
pages
94
and
95
which
i
read
from,
i
think
he
then
tries
to
take
the
interscience
contract
and
decide
whether
or
not
wiley,
a
stranger,
not
a
party
to
the
contract,
can
be
made
a
respondent
in
and
of
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
think,
and
this
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
argument,
we
think
that
where
what
is
not
clear
is
whether
a
respondent
is
--
is
committed
to
a
contract
obligation,
we
think
that
where
the
question
is,
has
the
respondent,
the
party
sought
to
be
charged,
made
an
agreement
to
arbitrate?
we
think
that
under
the
rules
that
this
court
has
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
laid
down
and
elaborated
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
white,
that
we
think
that
you
laid
down
two
rules
in
the
steelworkers
cases,
we
think
that
you
laid
down
a
clear
demonstration
rule
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
court
is
to
be
relieved
of
its
duty
to
determine
whether
the
party
sought
to
be
charged,
has,
in
fact,
made
an
agreement,
and
then
you
establish
the
second
rule
for
the
one
who
is
to
make
the
decision,
whether
it's
the
court
of
the
arbitrator,
as
to
whether
the
claim
that
is
made
is
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
aren't
talking,
sir,
of
an
arbitration
clause,
we're
talking
here
of
an
obligation
to
arbitrate.
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
arbitration
clause.
how
do
you
get
wiley
before
this
court?
wiley
is
a
107-year
old
company.
wiley
--
wiley
does
a
$15,000,000
volume
of
business.
wiley
has
400
employees.
interscience
was
a
company
having
40
unionized
people
and
according
to
the
record
doing
$1,000,000
worth
of
business.
that
was
an
error,
it
should've
been
$3,000,000.
but
--
but
interscience
has
been
absorbed
by
wiley.
interscience
isn't
findable
in
wiley.
interscience
business,
the
industrial
enterprise,
what
my
friend,
mr.
feller
terms
in
what
we
call
the
continuing
employing
enterprise
and
the
--
and
the
separate
collective
bargaining
unit
disappeared
as
a
result
of
the
absorption
of
the
interscience
business
into
wiley.
and
we
say
this
is
really
no
different
than
if
wiley
had,
in
fact,
purchased
the
interscience
business
as
it
could
have
with
the
--
exactly
the
same
results
incidentally,
under
the
internal
revenue
code
because
in
either
of
that,
it
would
have
been
a
deferred
recognition
of
(inaudible)
case.
had
they
purchased
it
and
given
for
the
assets,
given
to
the
stockholders
20%
of
the
wiley
stock
even
under
amicus'
brief,
they
concede.and
in
that
case,
they
would
have
no
claim
against
wiley.
now,
you've
found
me
into
the
heart
of
my
case,
and
i
--
i
welcome
it
because
my
first
point
is
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
obviously,
erroneously
gave
away
it's
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
wiley
made
a
contract.
and
obviously
and
clearly,
it
should
not
have
referred
back
to
the
arbitrator
to
determine.
how
do
the
union
in
amicus
treat
that?
well,
the
union
where
the
kind
of
shutting
its
eyes
hard
in
fervent
belief
says
that
the
court
did
decide.
well,
of
course,
that's
flying
into
the
face
of
the
language,
it
didn't.
amicus
looks
the
other
way.
amicus
doesn't
like
the
question
so
it,
in
substance,
says
to
this
court,
“you
decide.”
and
we
join
with
amicus.
and
we
asked
you
to
decide
it
because
we
think
the
record
is
sufficient
for
you
to
decide
it,
which
then
brings
me
to
the
four
questions,
which
i
think,
this
case
presents,
four
open
questions
we
--
we
present
them
at
page
3
of
our
reply
brief.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
interscience
obligation
to
arbitrate
is
binding
on
wiley,
whereas
a
proximate
result
of
the
merger
of
interscience
into
wiley,
the
business
and
workforce
of
interscience,
was
absorbed
by
wiley's
business,
and
the
interscience
industrial
community
was
dissolved.
my
view
of
the
question
is
not
the
broad
question
that
amicus
says,
does
the
contract
as
a
whole
carryover
it.
it's
a
much
narrower
one,
where
the
business
has
been
absorbed,
where
the
interscience
industrial
enterprise
has
been
terminated
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
merger,
does
the
contract
obligation
to
arbitrate
carry
on?
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
obliquely
if
i
may.
that
was
not
a
question
that
was
ever
before
this
court.
we
asserted
in
our
answering
papers
that
the
interscience
enterprise
was
dissolved
at
the
time
of
the
merger.
we
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
but
we
stated
as
a
fact
to
the
court
in
our
papers
and
our
position
and
it
was
never
denied
that
the
interscience
workforce
was
merged
into
and
was
integrated
into
the
wiley
workforce
on
october
2nd,
the
date
of
the
merger.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i'll
answer
that
question.
if
and
i
--
we
say
it
in
our
briefs,
we
don't
--
we
don't
try
to
deduct
that.
if
wiley
had
acquired
interscience
and
had
kept
interscience
as
a
separate
division,
separate
division,
i
have
no
doubt.
and
we
volunteer
the
rule,
although
there's
much
authority
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
board
against
it,
we
volunteer
the
rule
and
suggest
the
rule
then
in
that
case,
what
amicus,
and
we
call
the
rule
of
the
continuing
employing
enterprise
or
industrial
community,
would
have
required
wiley
to
recognize
the
union.
but
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
case
here
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
because
we
put
an
issue
that
fact.
we
took
the
position
before
the
trial
court.
before
this
complaint
was
served,
before
this
action
was
dreamt
of,
we
wrote
to
the
union
before
the
merger
and
at
the
date
of
the
merger
that
the
workforces
had
been
integrated.
i
refer
you
to
--
to
the
letters
appearing
on
pages
78
to
80.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
think
that's
--
that's
an
iffy
question
and
i
would
like
to
answer
differently.
i
say
to
you,
sir,
what
is
the
fact,
that
the
integration
was
commenced
according
to
plan,
pre-planning
and
plan
was
commenced
on
october
2nd
at
9
o'clock
the
date
of
the
merger
and
was
carried
through
over
a
period
of
four
months
until
the
first
week
in
january
when
the
interscience
offices
were
actually
closed
and
the
employees
who
were
still
remaining
in
interscience,
some
of
them
are
already
having
been
moved
over
to
wiley,
those
remaining
were
finally
moved
over
to
wiley.
but,
were
we
given
the
chance
to
offer
proof,
and
none
of
this
is
in
the
record
because
this
was
never
an
issue,
were
we
given
the
chance
to
offer
proof
on
this
in
addition
to
the
correspondents
that
we
have
in
this
record,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
would
say
in
substance
that
there
is
a
new
enterprise.
and
the
complaint
was
filed
before
the
contract
was
finished.
but
in
addition
to
that,
we
would
show
the
plan
of
integration,
which
actually
was
put
into
effect
and
was
accomplished
as
per
plan,
commencing
with
the
date
of
the
merger.
amicus
argues
that
unless
all
of
this
happens
on
the
precise
date
of
the
merger,
then
the
contract
goes
over.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
the
fact
--
the
fact
is
as
i've
told
you,
the
integration
was
commenced
on
the
date
of
the
merger
and
was
concluded
as
per
plan
in
the
first
week
of
january.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
the
contract
expired
--
correct,
the
contract
expired
on
january
31.
the
move,
the
physical
move
was
made,
this
does
not
appear
on
the
record
but
we
can
find
it
for
you
in
footnote,
the
date,
the
move
was
made
in
the
first
week
of
january,
three
weeks
before
the
contract
terminated.
now,
we
say
that
there
are
four
questions
that
this
case
presents.
the
first
one
is
the
one
that
we've
been
talking
about
which
is
whether
where,
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
merger,
not
on
the
date
of
the
merger
but
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
merger,
the
interscience
enterprise
is
discontinued,
can
there
be
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
successor
wiley
to
arbitrate
under
the
interscience
contract?
the
second
question
we
add,
is
whether
in
any
event,
even
assuming
that
there
might
be
some
carryover
of
employees'
rights,
can
the
union,
who
at
the
time
it
filed
it
suit,
was
no
longer
the
employees'
collective
bargaining
representative
because
these
40
people
had
been
merged
into
a
workforce
of
400
or
doing
similar
work,
can
the
union
arbitrate
claims
in
their
behalf
when
those
claims
relate
as
they
do
here,
not
to
liquidated
claims
but
to
working
conditions
in
the
wiley
enterprise?
different
question,
there
maybe
carryover
rights,
possibly,
none
is
yet
been
decided,
in
hearing
an
employees
following
the
termination
of
a
contract
and
before
a
new
contract
is
negotiated,
but
if
the
union
in
the
meantime
is
no
longer
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees,
can
it
commence
an
action
in
their
behalf?
and
we
think,
as
we
argue
at
length
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief
under
the
cases
montgomery
ward,
keenan,
modal,
glendale,
we
think
that
it
obviously
cannot.
the
third
question
is,
and
here,
we
come
to
your
steelworkers
cases,
whether
these
claims
to
permanent
working
conditions
in
the
interscience
enterprise
spelled
out
by
faith
from
an
interscience
contract
although
without
pointing
to
any
specific
provisions
in
the
contract,
whether
it's
conceivable
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
claim
to
a
carryover
of
these
permanent
working
conditions
to
a
different
employee
enterprise
can
be
a
claim
made
under
the
interscience
contract.
and
if
it's
not,
it's
obviously
not
made
within
the
scope
of
the
contract
and
obviously,
therefore,
it's
not
arbitrable.
and
the
fourth
question
that
we
present
to
your
honors,
is
a
question
that
you
have
now
as
yet
decided
on
what
the
union
calls
“procedural
arbitrability”
and
who
is
to
decide
it.
but
we
suggest
that
perhaps
you
don't
have
to
get
to
that
question
because
we
think
apart
from
arguments
pro
and
contrary
and
they're
argued
in
full
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
union's
and
amicus',
we
don't
think
this
is
really
a
procedural
arbit
--
arbritrability
case.
we
think
this
is
a
case
clearly
where
arbitration
was
abandoned
as
a
remedy
and
where
clearly
the
union
elected
to
bargain
with
the
company.
the
company
performance
talking
to
the
union
on
a
--
without
prejudice
basis,
without
prejudice
to
explain
that
the
contract
was
then
at
an
end,
and
it
recognized
no
rights
under
the
contract.
and
that
whereas
here,
after
four
months
of
such
without
prejudice
bargaining,
the
union
got
what
it
wanted.
we
think
that
now,
a
week
before
the
contract
when
it
files
it
suit
to
compel
arbitration,
never
having
demanding
it,
we
think
this
is
not
a
case
of
procedural
arbitrability.
we
think
this
is
just
clear
as
i
said
before,
abandoned.
this
is
a
wide
territory
that
--
that
we
cover
in
this
case.
and
each
one
of
these
points
really
makes
a
case
by
itself.
but
if
it's
agreeable
to
the
court,
i'll
choose
to
argue
at
--
at
length
from
the
question
that,
this
was
the
subject
of
a
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
white
and
me
because
i
think
this
is
a
--
the
four
new
questions,
this
is
probably
the
newest
and
that
is,
how
do
you
reach
wiley?
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
--
that's
--
that's
right,
sir.
how
do
you
reach
wiley?
the
union
says,
and
i
distinguish
district
65,
mr.
livingston
from
amicus,
the
union
says,
very
simple,
“we
sue
under
section
90.”
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“well,
that
doesn't
make
sense
in
a
labor
case.”
and
amicus
says,
“it
doesn't
make
sense
in
a
labor
case.”
now,
i
think
that
this
court
must
agree
that
the
--
this
difficult
question
involving
all
of
these
facets
of
relationships
between
company,
successor
company,
successor
company
and
employees
and
successor
company
and
collective
bargaining
agent
can't
be
decided
by
a
--
of
the
merger
and
consolidation
statute.
one
of
the
several
states
obviously
have
to
look
to
more
than
that.
so
i
think
the
fact
is
--
is
clearly
wrong.
i
think
clearly,
the
question
that
we
have
here
is
not
one
of
corporate
or
commercial
law
but
it's
a
question
of
labor
law.
that
does
not
depend
on
tactical
niceties
of
a
consolidation
statute
nor
we
suggest
upon
the
manner,
upon
the
manner
by
which
one
company
acquires
another.
and
here,
although
i
argue
for
the
company,
here
perhaps,
we
break
ground
and
argue
what
many
other
companies
might
know
or
assert
what
many
other
companies,
counsel
for
companies
might
not
be
willing
to
grant.
i
want
to
say
first,
there
are
four
possibilities
as
i've
seen
them
of
how
you
can
reach
wiley.
first
is
merger
and
consolidation
statute,
i
think
that's
clearly
wrong.
second,
you
can
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
which
is
to
say,
“well,
court
won't
pass
on
the
question
that
the
arbitrator
decide
everything.”
i
think
that
also
is
clearly
wrong,
and
i
think
so
does
amicus
say
it's
clearly
wrong.
the
court
must
decide
it.
the
arbitrator
can't
decide
whether
a
party
is
to
be
bound
to
a
contract.
and
the
fact
that
wiley
is
charged
here,
not
as
the
signing
party
but
as
a
successor
of
the
signing
party,
doesn't
author
the
question.
if
interscience
were
doing
business,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
did
interscience
make
the
contract.
interscience
is
no
more,
wiley
is
being
sued,
the
court
must
therefore
have
to
decide,
is
wiley
bound
by
express
assumption
of
contract,
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
or
by
operation
of
law?
this
is
the
threshold
finding
which
obviously
is
a
judicial
one
and
not
an
arbitral
one.
the
third
possibility
of
holding
wiley
is,
if
you
adapt
the
rule
presently
in
effect,
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
board,
and
that
is
that
absent
a
case
of
alter
ego,
and
this
clearly
is
a
good
faith
merger,
except
in
the
case
of
an
alter
ego,
a
purchaser
of
assets
is
never
to
be
held
to
the
contract
of
the
predecessor.
now,
it's
true
that
those
are
contract
bar
cases.
those
cases
were
decided
in
the
framework
of
whether
or
not
the
purchaser
company,
reinstating
the
operations
of
the
old
company,
could
claim
the
benefit
of
the
contract
that
the
seller
had
made
with
the
union
or
whether
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir,
and
we
suggest
that
you
can
fairly
equate
a
merger
such
as
here,
of
a
company
where
the
stockholders
of
the
merging
company
acquire
a
20%
stock
interest
in
the
surviving
company,
we
think
that
you
can
fairly
equate
that
to
an
asset's
purchase,
but
we
don't
argue
it.
we
don't
argue
that.
we
choose
instead
to
place
our
opposition
on
the
broader
rule
which
we
would
suggest
that
you
adopt.
and
i
think
in
this,
we
and
amicus
are
in
basic
agreement
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
which
is
that,
wiley
could
be
held
to
the
interscience
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
our
--
yes,
sir,
that's
the
first
question,
but
the
second
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
the
first
part
of
the
first
question.
the
second
part
of
the
first
question
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
because
amicus
and
we
are
suggesting
that
this
court
on
the
record
can
decide
the
question.
we
sugge
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
whether
wiley
is
bound
and
that
you
can
find
on
this
record
that
wiley
cannot
be
bound.
we're
asking
--
we're
asking
you
not
only
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
we're
suggesting
that
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
remand
at
the
trial.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
perhaps
i'd
better
not
speak
too
freely
for
amicus.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it's
my
understanding
that
we
are
in
agreement.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
the
union
says
that
section
90
of
the
consolidation
statute
imposes
as
a
matter
of
law
the
obligation
on
wiley.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
they
said
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
sir,
they
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
differently
than
we
do
and
they
construe
it
differently,
then
--
then
judge
kaufman
in
his
concurring
opinion
construed
it.
they
say
that
the
court
did
decide
it.
and
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
are
you
--
you
have
to
let
them
speak
for
themselves
because
they
are
the
ones
who
--
who
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
sir,
they
--
they
say
that
--
that
judge
medina
in
his
opinion
held
that,
we,
the
respondent,
are
required
by
contract
assumption
to
arbitrate
the
questions.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
but
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
well,
he
just
didn't
say
it.
this
is
what
the
union
says
he
said.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it
--
it
could
only
have
been
based
on
section
90.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
of
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law,
the
merger
and
consolidation
statute.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
but
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
but
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes
but
judge
medina
didn't
say
that.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that
is
exactly
the
union's
position.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
don't
think
that
anybody
disputes
that
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don't
just
don't
see
how
you
can
reach
that
point
because
in
your
steelworkers
cases,
and
just
last
--
this
week,
in
humphrey-moore
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
you
said
you
have
to
find
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
in
contract,
i'll
add
to
that,
in
contract
all
by
operation
of
law.
but
the
court
has
defined
it.
you
can't
leave
it
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
that
was
ever
intimated
in
your
opinion.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
no.
i
would
think
that
you
must
--
that
the
court
must
decide
it
first
because
otherwise,
you're
throwing
--
then
you
have
the
classic
case
of
bootstrap
jurisdiction,
then
you
are
throwing
everything
to
the
arbitrator
and
saying
“comeback
and
appeal
it
to
the
courts”.
they're
much
more
salutary
rule,
the
one
that
i
think
most
members
at
the
bar
read
the
steelworkers
cases
to
provide
and
that
is
the
court
must
decide
whether
the
party
is
required
to
arbitrate.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
you
came
pretty
close
to
it
in
humphrey-moore,
i
thought.
maybe
i
won't.
in
any
event,
the
rule
that
we're
talking
of,
the
rule
that
we're
suggesting
is
that,
if
following
the
merger,
the
separate
enterprise,
they're
separately
continued
and
the
collective
bargaining
unit
is
continued
as
a
separate
unit,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
hold
the
successor
whether
he's
a
successor
by
merger
or
purchase
or
reorganizational
whatever,
bound
to
that
contract.
but
we're
suggesting
that
where,
as
a
proximate
result
of
the
merger
or
the
purchase,
the
acquired
enterprise
is
dissolved
and
--
and
absorbed
completely.
and
the
collective
bargaining
unit
looses
its
identity,
then
we're
saying
there
can
be
no
carryover.
and
the
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
between
my
friend,
mr.
feller
and
me,
is
not
as
to
that
rule
but
as
to
its
application.
he
says
that
if
at
9
o'clock
on
october
2nd,
when
you
file,
and
i'm
exaggerating
a
little,
he
says
that
if
on
the
date
of
the
merger,
october
2nd,
you
terminated
the
interscience
enterprise
by
moving
the
40
people
over
to
the
wiley
offices
right
then,
9
o'clock
that
day,
and
the
court
has
to
dismiss
it.
but
he
says,
“if
you
didn't
move
them
over
that
day,
then
wiley
has
become
bound
by
the
contract
and
when
wiley
moves
them
over
the
next
day,
it
has
to
arbitrate
all
the
questions,
which
would
not
have
had
to
arbitrate,
had
it
moved
in
at
the
day
of
the
merger.
we
say
this
can't
be
the
rule.
the
rule
has
to
be
that
if
this
rule
of
the
continuing
employing
enterprise
or
an
industrial
community
is
to
be
adapted
and
we
think
it
a
logical
rule,
you
must
give
--
you
must
examine
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances,
as
mr.
feller
suggest,
and
you
must
examine
them
over
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
not
just
at
the
precise
moment
of
the
filing
of
the
merger
papers.
and
you,
is
the
court,
the
trial
court
and
obviously
and
not
the
arbitrator
because
it's
a
juridical
question
involving
whether
or
not
party
is
legally
bound
to
arbitrate.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
oh,
no
we
don't.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
we
don't.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
--
i
would
like
to
touch
on
that
but
let
me
add
just
two
minutes
to
what
i've
just
said.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
when
we
come
to
the
application
of
the
facts
to
this
case,
this
is
not
here,
as
i
said
before
after
trial.
amicus
is
--
doesn't
sustain
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
if
there's
--
even
if
we're
wrong
in
saying
that
the
record
shows
that
there
was
integration
at
the
date
of
the
merger,
all
we
have
to
show
is
an
issue
because
the
union,
having
gotten
the
benefit
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
has
to
support
it
and
has
to
support
it
by
showing
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
integration.
and
this
obviously,
it
can't
do.
and
i
would
like
to
add
the
second
comment
that
the
burden
to
do
this,
obviously,
must
be
on
the
union,
not
only
because
of
moves
for
summary
judgment
but
more
importantly
because
it
must
be
its
burden
to
establish
the
nexus
between
the
union
contract
and
wiley,
a
stranger
to
the
contract.
and
if
it
can't
rely
on
section
90
to
do
--
do
that,
it
must
support
the
burden
of
showing
a
continuing
enterprise
or
showing
that
wiley
has
carried
on
separate
or
at
least
separate
interscience
enterprise
as
--
as
it
separate
and
apart
thing
from
the
wiley
business.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
sir,
but
we're
--
but
we're
the
people
who
were
licked
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
no.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
because
i
would
pref
--
i
--
because
i
would
prefer
for
you
take
the
record
as
you
find
it
and
if
you
do,
i
think
that
you
would
find
that
we
are
not
only
entitled
to
reversal
but
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
dismissal.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
the
record
indicates
concededly,
a
physical
consolidation
prior
to
the
time
that
this
suit
was
commenced.
even
on
amicus'
own
rule,
if
at
that
time,
there
was
a
physical
consolidation,
and
if
the
intervening
time
between
the
merger
and
the
physical
consolidation
was
a
reasonable
theory
at
that
time
to
accomplish
the
absorption
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
interscience
enterprise
was
discontinued,
did
not
carryover,
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
wiley
company
and
therefore,
wiley
cannot
be
sued.
we
have
two
other
questions.
we
have
the
question
of
arbitrability.
we
claim
that
--
that
these
so-called
“glidden
type
questions”
are
not
arbitrable,
that
they're
really
not
glidden
type
questions.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
the
court
merely
decided,
at
page
100,
that
the
interscience
contract
in
an
action
against
interscience
would
have
supported
--
would
have
supported
these
claims.
but
if
you
turn
back
to
pages
94
and
95
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
if
it
were
an
action
as
against
interscience
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
yes.
judge
medina
so
held.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
he
did
it
as
against
interscience.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes,
but
if
you
look
at
--
at
what
judge
kaufman
said.
and
he
says
at
a
little
bit
more
concisely
on
page
110,
he
says
“we
hold
that
the
bargaining
agreement
does
not
clearly
remove
from
the
scope
of
arbitration
the
following
questions,
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
as
a
whole,
survived
the
consolidation.”
and
if
it
did,
thereby
imposing
on
wiley,
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
at
that
behest
of
the
union,
the
disputes
arising
before
its
natural
termination,
did
the
union
have
to
comport
with
the
three-step
grievance
procedures?
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
it
is
possible
to
answer
these
questions
separately,
and
we
tried
to
touch
on
this
in
our
main
brief.
i
think
this
has
sort
of
a
gasthof
thing
effect.
i
think
the
trouble
here
is
that
these
are
really
not
claims
as
claims
are
commonly
known
“vested
claims”.
i
think
this
is
a
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
don't
think
that
there
is
--
the
claim
--
it
is
asserted
that
there
are
claims
made
to
vested
rights.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
but
i'm
even
going
further
than
that.
i'm
saying
that
if
you
analyze
what
they're
saying
that
wiley,
after
the
contract
expiration
date,
must
pay
the
9%
of
wages
into
the
union
plan,
that
wiley
must
install
a
seniority
plan
and
must
install
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
following
the
date
of
the
contract
because
they
were
provided
for
in
an
expired
contract.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
--
this
is
what
they're
complaining
--
asking
for,
exactly
that.
what
they're
really
saying,
i
think
is
this,
this
does
not
appear
in
their
briefs,
they
are
saying
there
had
--
interscience
never
merged
and
had
the
interscience
contract
expired.
and
had
there
been
that
hiatus
between
the
expiration
of
the
interscience
contract
and
the
--
and
the
negotiation
and
signature
to
a
new
contract,
that
during
that
hiatus,
because
the
inter
--
interscience
enterprise
had
continued
and
because
the
employees
continued
to
work
as
a
separate
bargaining
unit
and
because
the
union
continued
to
represent
the
employees
even
though
the
contract
had
expired,
they
are
asserting
some
sort
of
right
of
a
carryover.
but
by
the
--
on
the
very
face
of
that
claim,
these
claims
cannot
carryover
to
a
different
enterprise.
so
that
i'm
saying
on
the
face
of
the
claim,
on
the
very
face
of
the
claim,
it
is
premised
on
a
continuation
of
the
interscience
enterprise
and
when
it
appears
as
it
does
appear
here,
that
the
interscience
enterprise
is
no
more,
it
must
then
appear
that
the
claim
is
not
the
within
the
scope
of
the
interscience
contract.
they
could
just
as
well
be
making
a
claim
against
the
united
states
steel
corporation,
because
if
the
interscience
enterprise
has
not
carried
over
to
wiley,
then
there
is
no
nexus,
there's
no
connection,
you'll
never
reach
wiley.
and
because
they
are
claiming
to
arbitrate
under
the
interscience
contract,
then
they're
asserting
the
claim
against
united
states
steel
or
wiley,
the
claim
obviously
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
contract.
i
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
remains
unless
the
court
has
any
additional
questions.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
thank
you.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please.
it
seems
to
me
that
mr.
harris
in
his
argument,
he
mentioned
essential
point
here.
he
suggests
that
even
though
the
union
lost
its
representative
rights
at
the
time
when
the
interscience
employees
were
merged
into
a
much
larger
wiley
group
that
nevertheless
those
employees
might
continue
to
have
individual
contract
rights.
they
may,
but
that
is
not
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
not
what
rights
due
the
employees
coming
over
from
the
interscience
and
being
put
into
the
wiley
establishment.
the
question
is
not
here
as
to
what
rights
if
any
of
those
employees
may
have.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
union
which
formally
represented
those
employees
and
upon
the
collective
--
in
a
collective
bargaining
group
and
which
now
no
longer
represents
them
may
arbitrate,
not
may
sue
for
them.
it's
conceivable
that
these
employees
having
rights
hypothetically
had
given
powers
of
attorney
to
--
to
the
union
to
sue
in
behalf
of
john
jones
and
john
smith
to
vindicate
personal
rights.
it's
conceivable
that
such
a
lawsuit
might
have
been
commenced
not
by
the
union
in
a
representative
capacity
but
by
the
union
as
an
attorney
for
a
particular
individual.
this
proceeding,
however,
is
an
application
to
compel
wiley
to
arbitrate
with
the
union
under
a
contract
which
is
no
longer
effective
in
which
became
ineffective
when
the
interscience
industrial
community
was
dissolved
and
terminated.
at
that
time,
whatever
i
say,
i
say
again.
at
that
time
whatever
the
individual
rights
may
have
been,
certainly
the
arbitral
right
disappeared
because
this
was
a
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
say
that
the
right
to
arbitrate
disappeared
on
october
2nd.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
because
pursuant
to
a
plan
announced
to
the
union
in
advance
of
the
merger
actually
put
into
operation
on
the
date
of
the
merger
and
actually
completed
pursuant
to
plan
within
two
months
plus
following
the
merger,
the
interscience
industrial
community
was
physically
broken
up.
it
was
moved
per
plant,
block,
stock
and
barrel
over
into
a
much
larger
plant.
the
interscience
employees
were
relieved
from
the
work
that
they
formally
were
doing.
there
was
no
longer
interscience
work
to
be
done.
they
were
put
on
wiley
jobs.
they
were
no
longer
represented
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
by
this
union
because
this
union
represented
a
group
of
40
clericals
working
in
an
interscience
establishment
and
not
40
out
of
400
employees
doing
similar
work
in
the
similar
unit
working
in
the
wiley
establishment.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
--
that
as
of
the
date
when
the
--
when
the
dissolution
of
the
interscience
enterprise
was
commenced,
the
interscience
collective
bargaining
contract
was
no
longer
appropriate.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
we
have
another
--
we've
been
--
we've
been
misquoted
by
the
union
on
amicus.
we
never
took
the
position
at
the
time
of
the
merger
that
the
merger
as
such
terminated
the
contract
or
prevented
the
obligation
that
interscience
had
from
flowing
over
to
wiley.
we
took
the
position
before
the
merger
and
at
the
time
of
the
merger
that
the
contract
would
no
longer
be
effective
because
the
work
force
of
interscience
was
being
integrated
into
the
wiley
work
force.
now,
i
should
say
that
we
never
had
the
opportunity
to
present
proof
on
this.
this
record
is
--
is
--
in
thin
state
over
this
because
the
union
moved
for
summary
judgment.
we
stated
the
ultimate
type
that
the
interscience
enterprise
had
been
integrated
into
the
wiley
enterprise.
the
union
didn't
think
that
it
was
relevant
or
important.
we
suggested
that
if
the
union
was
to
proceed
in
court
under
section
301
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
proceeding
under
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act
that
we
should
be
given
as
a
defendant
in
a
plenary
action,
pretrial,
advantages
of
development
of
proof.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
that
is
our
position
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
--
sir,
yes.
and
the
facts
to
support
that,
we
think
are
adequately
stated
in
the
record.
if
you
take
the
--
the
fact
that
phy
--
the
physical
consolidation
according
to
the
union's
own
position
took
place
in
january
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
to
see
the
announced
plan
of
wiley
on
and
before
october
2.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
think
it's
essential
to
establish
that
--
that
the
court
must
decide
whether
or
not
wiley
is
responsible
to
arbitrate.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
would
think
that
under
that
rule,
your
honor,
wiley
would
be
relieved
from
arbitrating
with
the
union.
because
we
take
the
position
that
the
--
what
--
we
--
if
given
the
opportunity
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
the
fact
--
the
fact
is
there's
no
--
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
this?
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
but
we
would
show
that
on
the
day
of
the
merger,
interscience
employees
were
brought
over
the
wiley.
if
given
the
opportunity
to
present
fact
here,
we
would
show
that
on
the
very
date
of
the
merger
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
oh
yes.
we
--
we
make
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
we
presented
a
number
of
other
defendants.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
--
that
the
union
lost
its
right
to
arbitration
and
abandoned
the
arbitration.
they
elected
not
to
arbitrate.
they've
elected
to
bargain
with
us.
it
talked
with
us
for
four
months
when
we
said
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
so
called
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
so
called.
we
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
we
have
--
we
have
two
others.
another
defense
that
we
have
is
that
the
claims,
as
of
them
is
by
themselves,
are
not
arbitrable.
that
they're
not
arbitrable
because
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
not
--
not
within
the
scope
of
the
contract
at
all.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
and
the
third
reason
why
we
say
that
--
that
we
have
a
full
and
complete
defense
is
that
we
say
that
in
any
event,
the
union
has
lost
its
right
to
arbitrate
for
this
people.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
i
--
i
would
sir,
except
that
i
put
that
under
my
nonarbitrable
point
because
it
seems
to
me,
if
only
for
the
reason
that
the
contract
says
that
the
company
shall
make
contributions
to
the
union
welfare
plan
for
two
years
ending
january
31,
that
any
claim
that
the
union
makes
that
the
company,
whether
interscience
or
wiley,
should
make
contributions
for
succeeding
years,
obviously
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
contract.
we
think
that
a
point
is
reached
notwithstanding
the
--
the
--
your
decisions
in
the
steel
workers
cases.
we
think
a
point
is
reached
where
as
professor
cox
had
occasioned
to
say,
you
can
have
a
frivolous
assertion.
our
claim
was
distinguished
from
a
fri
--frivolous
claim.
and
we
haven't
had
the
time
to
--
to
argue
or
discuss
these
questions,
and
the
fact
that
i
haven't
argued
them,
doesn't
mean
that
i
don't
feel
very
strongly
about
that.
we
--
we
think
that
--
i
see
my
light
is
over.
my
--
my
light
is
off.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it
is
in
the
record
but
not
printed
but
i
should
like
to
hand
it
up
if
i
may.
it
--
it's
exhibit
2
(a).
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it
provided
nothing.
i
drew
the
agreements.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
it
provided
nothing
about
assumption
of
existing
contracts.
it
said
nothing.
we
relied
to
protect
the
--
the
creditors
of
interscience.
we
relied
on
the
section
90
of
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law.
i'd
like
to
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
assumption
has
been
made,
i
think
too
glibly,
that
section
90,
if
it
were
held
to
apply,
would
apply
to
this.
section
90
as
i
read
it,
refers
to
rights
of
creditors.
that's
the
way
the
section
is
titled.
i
don't
consider
that
the
right
of
a
collective
bargaining
representative
to
demand
arbitration
is
a
creditor's
right
which
even
if
section
90
did
apply
would
carry
over
under
that
section.
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
there's
nothing
in
the
act,
sir
--
mr.
charles
h.
lieb
no,
sir.
as
--
as
we
said
on
thursday,
the
lower
courts
and
the
board
have
held
on
contract
board
questions
that
the
successor
is
never
been
there,
unless
he's
an
(inaudible)
under
the
old
contract.
thank
you
very
much.
