i
want
to
see
if
i
can
get
this
clears
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
held
was
that
where
a
company
has
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
a
union,
that
company
is
bought
out
or
absorbed
by
a
company
that
has
no
such
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
the
federal
rule
from
now
on
is
that
the
company
that
bought
it
out
and
absorbed
it,
becomes
liable
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that's
the
federal
rule
that
we
find.
justice

the
merger
agreement

what
did
it
provide
if
anything
about
the
assumption
of
the
existing
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
nothing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
national
labor
that's
expressly
--
which
refers
at
all,
what
happened
to
the
company
owning
a
factory,
or
a
person
owning
a
factory
to
have
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
unions
to
sell
that
factory
to
another
company
or
another
person?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
its
expressed
or
referred
to?
