mr.
thomas
e.
harris
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
as
counsel
for
the
amicus,
the
afl-cio
by
courtesy
of
counsel
for
the
respondent
here.
i
wish
to
address
myself
principally
to
the
question
whether
wiley
is
bound
by
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
between
the
union
and
interscience.
now,
viewing
this
question
simply
as
one
of
private
contract
law,
section
90
of
the
new
york
stock
corporation
law
with
control
and
wiley
quite
clearly,
under
that
state
statute,
would
be
bound
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
at
least
up
until
the
point
that
it
expire.
however,
we
agree
with
counsel
for
petitioner
and
with
the
court
below
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
of
federal
labor
relations
policy
which
is
controlled
by
federal
doctrine
derived
from
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
decisions
of
the
board,
and
other
sources.
while
the
state
law
might
be
taken
over
as
a
part
of
federal
law,
if
it
were
given
any
effect,
it
would
be
by
that
sort
of
adoption
rather
than
simply
by
its
own
standing.
in
general,
we
think
that
the
relations
between
an
employer,
a
union,
and
the
employees
are
not
controlled
either
by
state
law
nor
yet
by
a
private
contract
or
agency
law,
but
rather
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
principles
derived
therefrom.
for
this
reason,
a
collective
bargaining
contract
is
quite
different
from
an
ordinary
contract.
the
union
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
is
by
federal
statute
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
all
of
the
employees.
it
can
bind
dissenting
employees,
employees
not
yet
fired
and
the
employee
here
must
deal
with
it
whether
the
employer
wishes
to
or
not.
if
the
employer
in
the
union
reached
agreement,
they
must
embody
that
agreement
in
a
written
contract.
this
contract
in
turn
is
binding
on
all
employees
including
dissenters
and
people
hired
thereafter.
the
opportunity
of
the
employees
to
dispense
for
the
one
union
as
their
collective
bargaining
representative
and
to
supplant
it
with
another
is
quite
limited
by
a
federal
law.
the
contract
itself
is
not
a
simple
private
contract
but
a
code
for
the
industrial
community.
as
this
court
said
in
warrior
&
gulf
navigation,
it
is
an
effort
to
erect
a
system
of
industrial
self
government.
now,
the
national
labor
relations
act
likewise
regulates
and
in
some
detail,
the
rights
of
parties
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
terminate
or
modify
them.
that
regulation
will
be
found
in
part
in
section
8
(d).
finally,
the
national
labor
relations
board
doctrine
likewise
controls
whether
an
employer
must
continue
to
deal
with
the
union
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
notwithstanding
changes
and
the
methods
of
an
employer
doing
business
as
when
the
business
is
sold
or
when
the
method
of
operation
has
otherwise
changed.
now,
the
petitioner
suggests
that
this
body
of
board
doctrine
as
to
when
an
employer
or
in
what
circumstances
an
employer
must
or
need
not
continue
to
bargain
with
the
union
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
should
also
control
whether
an
outstanding
and
unexpired
collective
bargaining
agreement
continues
in
effect.
we
agree
with
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
in
general,
this
body
of
doctrine
should
control
for
this
purpose.
now,
what
is
this
body
of
doctrine?
in
general
it
is
that
if
the
operation
of
the
enterprise
is
so
drastically
changed
that
the
old
industrial
community
is
dissolved.
the
old
bargaining
unit
then
becomes
inappropriate.
the
employer
has
no
further
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
in
that
unit.
now,
this
--
this
salute
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no,
your
honor
and
i
will
come
to
that.
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
did
not
come
about
for
several
months
whether
it
ever
came
about,
we
don't
know,
but
i
will
come
to
that
in
more
detail.
now,
the
petitioner
quotes
and
for
the
decision
of
the
board
in
cruse
motors
which
summarizes
the
board
doctrine
as
to
the
obligation
of
the
employer
to
continue
the
deal.
a
mere
change
--
and
this
is
a
quotation
from
the
board.
"a
mere
change
in
ownership
of
the
employment
enterprise
is
not
so
unusual
a
circumstance
as
to
affect
the
certification.
where
the
enterprise
remains
essentially
the
same,
the
obligation
to
bargain
of
a
prior
employer
devolves
upon
his
successor
and
title."
the
form
that
the
change
of
ownership
takes
is
immaterial.
that
is
whether
it's
a
sale
of
assets,
a
merger,
or
consolidation,
or
a
stock
purchase.
it's
the
continued
existence
or
lack
of
it
of
the
industrial
community
that
is
decisive.
indeed,
transfer
of
ownership
is
by
itself
irrelevant
for
this
purpose.
an
employer
may,
without
any
change
in
ownership,
so
hold
to
his
operations
that
a
bargaining
unit
that
was
formally
appropriate
is
dissolved
or
submerged
in
a
larger
unit
or
that
a
new
unit
is
created.
if
that
happens,
he
is
no
longer
obligated
to
bargain
with
the
union
certified
for
the
whole
unit.
of
course
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
inhibit
the
employer
in
making
changes
that
will
destroy
the
collective
bargaining
unit
but
if
it
does
not,
this
problem
can't
arise
even
without
any
sort
of
change
of
ownership.
now,
if
by
reason
of
the
changes
and
operation,
the
old
industrial
community
disappears
and
a
new
appropriate
bargaining
unit
comes
into
existence
in
which
the
union
represents
only
a
minority
and
that
is
what
the
petitioner
says
happens
here.
then
we
would
agree
that
it's
probably
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
for
the
employer
to
continue
to
bargain
with
the
union
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
for
all
of
the
employees.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
say
that
--
that
the
employer
here
contends,
the
petitioner,
and
this
is
what
they
contended
from
even
before
the
merger
took
place.
that
where
one
--
where
the
method
of
operation
is
so
changed
that
the
industrial
community
is
dissolved,
and
the
old
group
of
employees
is
merged
into
a
different
and
larger
group
of
employees
so
that
the
union
now
represents
only
a
minority
and
what
is
now
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
they
say
that
the
employer
is
under
no
obligation
to
continue
to
bargain
with
the
union
as
the
representative
of
the
unit.
and
indeed
we
agree
with
that,
we
think
that
given
that
set
of
facts.
indeed,
it
is
probably
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
too.
this
court
has
held
for
example
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
make
a
contract
with
a
minority
union
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
for
all
of
the
employees.
that
was
the
holding
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
international
ladies
garment
workers,
the
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
our
answer
to
that
in
this
case
is
that
that
is
not
this
case.
the
record
here
quite
clearly
shows
that
the
wiley
employees,
the
interscience
employees,
continued
to
work
at
the
old
interscience
plant
for
some
months
after
the
merger.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
when
they
were
finally,
physically
moved
to
the
wiley
plant.
i
believe
counsel
for
the
petitioner
stated
that
it
was
early
in
january
of
1962.
but
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
no
such
change
took
place
immediately
upon
the
legal
merger
which
was
october
2nd,
1961.
that
for
some
months
thereafter,
the
old
interscience
employees
continued
to
work
for
wiley
at
the
old
interscience
plant
just
as
before
presumably
under
new
management.
presumably
there
was
a
change
in
the
top
personnel
other
than
mr.
lieb
who
survived,
as
we
say
the
industrial
community,
did
for
some
months.
now,
as
to
what
happened
around
the
end
of
the
year,
at
that
point,
the
employees
were
moved
physically
to
the
old
wiley
plant.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
the
intention
--
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
was
that
the
contract
would
automatically
expire
at
that
point.
the
contention
of
the
union
was
that
it
did
not
expire.
the
very
point
which
is
here
at
issue
before
the
court
was
debated
between
the
parties
through
the
summer
of
1961
preceding
the
merger
and
they
reached
no
agreement
upon
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
would
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
would
not
have
any
significance
on
our
position
that
the
old
unit
survived
and
that
the
union
retained
its
status
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
and
that
the
contract
continued
in
full
force
in
effect
unless
and
until
that
physical
shift
took
place.
the
fact
that
the
employer
announced
that
it
was
going
to
take
place
sometime
could
not,
in
our
view,
affect
the
status
of
the
union
as
bargaining
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
representative
or
the
continued
validity
of
the
contract.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
would
make
some
difference
because
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
arbitrator
could
well
find
that
the
employer's
responsibilities
under
the
contract
differed
after
the
physical
merger
of
the
two
work
staff.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
now,
let
me
say
first
that
even
after
the
physical
--
even
after
the
interscience
(inaudible)
employees
were
transferred
physically
to
wiley
that
we
do
not
know
that
the
old
interscience
union
disappeared
at
that
point.
these
employees
were
a
unit
of
clerical
and
shipping
employees.
now,
if
for
example
they
were
shifted
to
wiley
and
that
wiley
they
continued
to
handle
the
shipping
function
which
they
had
handled
theretofore
and
remained
a
desperate
and
unidentifiable
group
of
employees,
quite
conceivably
the
bargaining
unit
could
have
survived
even
when
--
after
they
moved
their
place
of
work
a
few
blocks.
but
the
record
is
silent
on
what
happened
to
these
employees
at
that
point.
if
on
the
other
hand
they
were
scattered
out,
interspersed
inextricably
among
the
wiley
employees,
then
presumably
the
bargaining
unit
disappeared.
but
the
record
doesn't
answer
that.
all
it
shows
is
that
it
survived
for
some
months.
what
happened
after
that,
we
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
yes.
now,
i
think
that
that
question
whether
there
is
any
obligation
to
arbitrate
at
all,
is
answered
very
simply
by
the
fact
that
the
unit
and
the
contract
did
survive
for
some
period
after
october
2nd.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
even
though
it
planned
--
it
survived
pending
in
plan
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
because
under
the
doctrine
argued
urged
both
by
petitioner
and
us,
as
long
as
the
old
industrial
community
survives
as
an
identifiable
community
and
it's
not
submerged
in
a
new
one,
the
union
retains
its
bargaining
status
and
retains
its
--
and
that
we
--
we
think
that
the
contract
should
continue
on
effect.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
now
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
now,
the
petitioner's
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
if
the
old
unit
survived
and
the
contract
survived
for
some
period
of
time
after
october
2,
then
the
union
is
entitled
to
arbitrate
as
to
what
its
rights
under
that
contract
or
what
the
rights
of
the
employees
under
that
contract
are.
that
would
be
true
even
if
the
arbitration
had
not
been
brought
and
then
after
the
contract
run
out
which
was
indeed
the
situation
in
american
manufacturer.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
but
the
union
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
the
union
never
did
ask
arbitration.
what
happened
was
that
there
were
long
negotiations
between
the
union
and
the
company.
the
union,
interscience,
and
wiley
in
the
course
of
which
interscience
and
wiley
flatly
took
the
position
that
the
contract
would
automatically
terminate
on
october
2
when
the
legal
merger
went
into
effect.
the
company
did
agree
to
pay
certain
benefits
to
the
employees
under
the
contract
but
it
took
the
position
that
it
was
doing
this
voluntarily,
that
the
contract
was
automatically
out
of
existence.
finally,
when
these
negotiations
were
at
an
end
and
the
company
adhered
to
its
position
that
it
would
not
recognize
the
contract
for
any
period
after
october
2
or
recognize
the
union
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
then
the
union
brought
suit.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
your
honor.
and
let
me
go
on
now
and
tell
you
what
i
think
would
be
the
difference
after
the
--
assuming
that
the
interscience
industrial
community
was
at
some
point
submerged.
let
me
tell
you
what
effect
i
think
the
contract
might
have
been.
and
you
will
see
that
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
it
does
not
depend
on
that
but
that
the
employer's
liability
under
the
contract
would
be
broader
for
the
period
that
the
old
industrial
community
survived.
now,
these
questions
which
i
will
come
to
now,
i
think
are
questions
for
the
arbitrator,
not
questions
for
the
court.
but
i
will
indicate
what
i
think
the
arbitrator
might
decide
by
way
of
indicating
what
difference
i
think
the
submergence
of
the
community
would
make.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
that
the
only
responsibility
of
the
court
is
to
decide
whether
wiley
was
bound
for
any
period
by
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
i
think
that
is
a
question
for
the
court.
now,
assuming
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
do.
i
say
that
by
reason
of
that,
i
say
if
the
contract
continued
in
full
effect
until
the
industrial
community
was
submerged
assuming
that
it
eventually
was
which
the
record
is
silent
on.
but
i
would
say
that
the
contract
has
some
effect
even
after
the
--
even
assuming
the
disappearance
of
the
indust
--
the
old
interscience
industrial
community.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
that
--
that
is
what
i
want
to
come
to
now,
and
it
will
be
in
terms,
i
think,
of
what
the
arbitrator
might
decide.
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well
--
well,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it's
an
easy
case
for
you.
i
think
that
all
that
you
have
to
dec
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
all
that
you
have
to
decide
is
that
wiley
is
bound
by
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
that
that
could
be
decided
simply
on
the
fact
that
the
old
industrial
community
continued
in
existence
for
sometime
after
october
2.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
--
i
don't
think
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
don't
think
the
court
need
decide
what
the
rights
under
the
contracts
are
or
which
provisions
of
it
continued
in
effect,
under
which
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
for
some
period
after
october
2.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no,
because
your
honor
--
because
even
if
the
contract
had
expired,
you
can
ask
arbitration
under
an
expired
contract.
if
the
substantive
rights
you
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
seek
to
vindicate
arose
under
the
contract.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well
--
well,
let's
look
at
what
the
--
let's
look
at
what
the
arbitrator
might
decide.
assuming
that
at
some
point,
the
old
industrial
community
and
the
old
collective
bargaining
unit
disappeared.
first,
i
think
the
arbitrator
and
i
am
talking
only
about
the
latter
part
of
the
period
and
upon
petitioner's
assumption
that
the
old
interscience
employees
were
submerged
in
the
body
of
wiley
employees.
now,
up
until
that
happened,
i
think
the
arbitrator
can
enforce
the
full
contract.but
after
it
happened,
i
think
there
are
some
parts
of
the
contract
that
he
could
enforce
and
some
that
he
couldn't.
for
example,
the
exclusive
bargaining
clause
could
not
be
applicable
assuming
a
new
unit
at
wiley
where
this
union
is
not
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
the
recognition
clause
of
the
contract,
article
1,
section
1,
couldn't
be
enforced.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
as
to
the
union
shop
provisions.
the
old
contract
could
be
expired
only
to
the
old
interscience
employees
obviously,
not
to
new
hires.
however,
even
assuming
the
submergence
of
the
old
community,
what
reason
is
there
why
the
contract
should
not
be
applied
to
the
old
interscience
employees
as
respects
such
matters
as
severance
pay
and
accrued
vacation
pay.
now,
the
petitioner
actually
did
pay
the
severance
employee
pay
provided
by
the
old
contract
to
11
employees
who
quit
when
they
were
moved
over
to
wiley.
petitioner
has
searched
in
its
brief
that
if
they
accrued
vacation
pay
through
the
end
of
the
contract.
though
the
record
is
silent
on
that,
the
payments
to
the
welfare
and
pension
plan
under
the
old
contract
or
in
exactly
the
same
status,
these
are
accrued
financial
rights.
why
should
not
those
rights
be
enforced
under
the
contract?
whatever
happened
to
the
old
industrial
community?
now,
when
you
come
to
seniority
rights,
the
question
for
the
arbitrator
would
be,
whether
the
contract
conferred
rights
surviving
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
in
zdanok
v.
glidden,
the
second
circuit
held
for
example
that
that
particular
contract
did
contain
seniority
rights,
rights
as
to
rehire
and
recall
which
survived
the
expiration
of
the
contract
and
the
shutting
down
of
the
plant
and
its
movable
to
a
new
location
some
hundreds
of
miles
away.
if
the
arbitrator
found
that
the
contract
was
intended
to
confer
seniority
rights
which
survived
its
expiration,
the
further
question
would
be,
"how
are
these
rights
to
be
applied
in
the
chain
circumstances?"
that
is
how
can
--
assuming
that
there
are
seniority
rights
under
the
expired
contract,
how
can
this
be
given
to
the
old
interscience
employees
in
the
new
work
--
framework
at
wiley.
now,
the
petitioner
argues
that
once
the
operation
is
so
changed
that
the
bargaining
unit
disappears
which
it
asserts
happened
in
early
january
of
1962
and
that
they
had
in
mind
all
the
time.
they
assert
that
once
that
happens,
the
employer
is
no
longer
bound
to
deal
with
the
union.
indeed,
that
it
can
no
longer
properly
deal
with
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
labor
relations
policy.
however,
there
is
no
federal
labor
relations
policy
against
the
enforcement
of
contracts
of
a
minority
union,
assuming
that
it's
a
valid
contract,
when
there
is
no
majority
union
in
the
plant.
in
retail
clerks
international
union
v.
lion
dry
goods,
369
u.s.
17,
this
court
held
that
a
contract
entered
into
by
a
union
which
had
lost
its
majority
during
the
strike,
this
was
a
contract
dealing
with
the
settlement
of
the
strike
providing
for
reinstatement
of
the
strikers
covering
certain
other
points.
this
court
held
that
that
contract
was
enforceable
by
the
union
under
section
301
even
though
a
union
had
admittedly
lost
its
majority
in
the
plant.
indeed,
as
long
as
there
is
no
exclusive
bargaining
representative
in
the
plant,
and
no
exclusive
bargaining
contract
covering
the
plant,
there
is
no
federal
policy
against
individual
employment
contracts.
an
individual
worker
can
enter
into
an
employment
contract
with
the
employer
and
that
contract
will
be
enforced
so
long
as
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
representative
and
no
contract
which
undertakes
to
supersede
that
individual
contract.
if
the
contract
is
in
--
is
for
the
purpose
of
forwarding
collective
bargaining
or
if
the
employer
refuses
to
bargain
because
of
the
individual
contracts,
then
the
contracts
should
be
void
under
this
court's
decision
in
j.i.
case.
but
there
is
no
federal
policy
in
general
against
either
individual
contracts
or
minority
union
contracts.
now,
if
another
union
were
certified
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
at
wiley,
then
perhaps
this
union
could
no
longer
enforce
the
contract.
perhaps
the
new
union
would
become
the
agent
even
to
enforce
rights
which
survived
under
the
old
contract.
and
of
course,
the
new
union
could
enter
into
a
new
contract
which
might
change
the
rights
under
the
old
contract
with
the
exception
of
such
individual
rights
as
it
indivisibly
vested.but
that
is
not
the
situation.
there
is
no
new
union
here.
there
is
no
new
contract.
and
simply
as
the
holder
of
the
contract,
though
not
perhaps
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
the
union
surely
still
has
status
to
enforce
whatever
rights
survived
under
the
old
contract.
we
believe
that
--
that
the
federal
policy
should
favor
enforcement
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
protection
of
rights
accruing
under
it
notwithstanding
such
matters
as
changes
of
ownership
as
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
felt.
the
labor
management
relations
act
is
concerned
with
promoting
industrial
piece
not
with
such
technicalities
as
whether
a
plant
is
required
by
stock
purchase,
merger,
asset
purge
--
merger.
here,
actually
these
technicalities
support
the
union's
position
and
it
could
prevail
under
the
new
york
law
if
that
were
applicable.
but
we
think
that
that
is
not
the
main
point.
the
national
labor
relations
policy
favors
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
a
means
of
promoting
industrial
harmony.
it
so
states
in
numerous
pace
--
places.
it
provides
a
special
forum,
the
federal
courts
under
3012
enforcement.
and
as
i
said,
there
is
no
federal
policy
against
enforcement
even
after
a
union
loses
its
majority
status.
finally,
the
denial
of
enforcement,
would
this
involve
--
manifest
injustice?
these
employees
would
be
denied
their
bargain
for
quid
pro
quo
and
they
would
be
denied
whatever
they
gave
up
to
get
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
when
it
was
negotiated.
finally,
let
me
state
again
that
while
i
have
discussed
these
questions
as
to
what
an
arbitrator
might
hold
the
liabilities
to
be
under
the
contract.
one,
before
the
physical
consolidation
to
even
assuming
a
physical
consolidation,
that
i
don't
think
that
any
of
these
questions
are
for
the
court.
i
think
that
all
that
is
for
it
now
is
the
question
whether
wiley
was
bound
for
some
period
of
time
to
arbitrate
on
the
old
agreement.
and
we
submit
that
it
clearly
was.
now,
what
i
have
said
--
again,
i
would
like
to
repeat
that
under
the
labor
board
doctrine
which
is
applicable
here,
it
wouldn't
matter
really
whether
any
merger
of
companies
or
any
change
of
ownership
at
all
had
taken
place.
as
i
have
said,
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
single
employer
with
no
change
of
operation
to
so
change
his
method
of
operation
as
to
destroy
the
bargaining
unit
and
as
to
undercut
the
statutory
duty
to
bargain
with
a
union
for
that
unit.
even
there,
we
would
take
the
position
as
we
do
here
that
the
employer
continues
bound
under
the
old
contract.
and
that
the
union
has
standing
to
enforce
it,
unless
and
until
there
is
some
new
union
that
negotiates
a
new
contract
that
supersedes
it.
thank
you.
