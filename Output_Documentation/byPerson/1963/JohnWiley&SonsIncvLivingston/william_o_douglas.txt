does
anything
occur
in
the
arbitration,
in
their
proposed
arbitration?
was
there
an
arbiter?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
didn't
rule
on
this
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that
there
had
been
arbitration
that
the
issue
that
you
now
litigate
could
have
been
making
to
the
court
as
result
of
the
outcome
--
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
arbitration,
is
it
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
was
that
--
is
that
--
whatever
the
arbiter
would
decide
would
be
reviewable,
i
suppose,
by
courts
or
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
that
would
--
that
short
circuits
another
question
whether
or
not
it
should
not
be
preliminary
question
for
the
arbiter
to
come
if
--
if
probably
as
agreed
to
a
court
for
review
after
the
arbitration.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
in
our
steelworkers
formula
--
formula
of
our
steelworkers
case
will
--
what
is
left
for
judicial
review
whether
that
would
be
one
of
those
questions.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
question
is
when
does
the
court
do
it?
does
the
court
do
it
now
or
does
the
court
do
it
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
part
of
--
for
arbitration,
that's
another
alternative.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
we
have
never
decided
it
yet.
