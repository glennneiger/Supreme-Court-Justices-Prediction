you

i'm
not
sure
and
do
you
think
that

had
the

of
the

justice

white
what
do
you
think
--
what
do
you
think
the
rule
has
been,
as
laid
down
in
this
court,
that
when
--
that
when
the
contract
does
not
clearly
put
outside
the
scope
of
arbitration
and
that
is
in
dispute,
you
order
arbitration
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
when
you
read
--
when
you
read
an
arbitration
clause
and
you
have
some
real
doubt
about
which
way
would
its
arbitrable
or
not
and
that's
about
an
even
question,
what
do
you
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
when
without
much
doubt
about
an
arbitration
clause
is
to
be
this
way
or
another,
the
court
has
to
resolve
with
this,
does
it
order
of
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
(inaudible)
that
the
dissolution
of
the
bargaining
unit
took
place,
at
the
time
of
the
merger
or
when
it
actually
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
holding
was
the
collective
bargaining
contract
in
this
case
survived
the
merger.
i
mean
if
that
all
or
was
to
it
--
let's
assume
that
the
holding
was
that
the
--
that
it
survived
the
merger.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
--
when
--
then
was
there
a
(inaudible)
between
them
and
the
--
and
the
dissolution
of
the
bargaining
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
but
we're
talking
about
the
bargaining
unit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
that
(inaudible)
--
is
that
--
that
(voice

on
the
date
of
the
merger
i
think,
did
you
--
did
you
keep
the
--
the
(inaudible)
clause
in
this
contract
and
wiley
had
taken
over
interscience's
plant
to
keep
the
plant
separate
and
the
bargaining
unit
intact,
this
probably
would've
been
dealing
with
this
union
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
of
course,
i
wonder
either
the
union
or
amicus
says
that
the
integration
of
the
unit
took
place
at
a
date
after
the
merger.
i'm
not
--
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
did
take
place
after
the
merger
but
did
it
--
would
it
had
taken
place
as
much
after
the
merger
--
as
after
the
terminate
--
expiration
date
have
come
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
(inaudible)
about
that,
i'm
just
interested
in
the
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
before
the
contract
was
scheduled
to
expire.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
as
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
wiley
is
bound
(inaudible)
don't
make
the
arbitration
clause
reaches
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
these
kinds
of
issues
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
survival,
the
questions
of
surviving
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
is
to
be
answered
to
his
question
that
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
held
that
the
arbitration
clause
reached
this
--
this
kind
of
an
--
these
kinds
of
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
but
he
--
but
justice
brennan
said
assuming
wiley
is
the
step
of
the
arbitration
clause
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
decided
that
wiley
have
to
arbitrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
it
--
that
they
--
you
don't
think
it
left
to
the
--
one
of
the
arbitrator's
questions
whether
--
whether
wiley
is
bound
to
this
arbitration
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assuming
interscience
will
have
two
plants,
there
was
no
merger
and
one
was
organized
and
one
wasn't
and
it
discontinued
to
organize
the
plant,
took
the
employees
together
in
one
plant
and
--
and
there
was
no
--
and
the
union
no
longer
had
a
majority,
what
is
the
consequence
upon
a
labor
contract
if
it
has
still
had
a
year
to
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
position
is
even
though
the
union
has
no
majority
of
the
--
of
the
employees
in
that
plant
which
is
now
--
all
the
employees
are
in
one
plant
and
the
union
has
no
majority,
does
the
contract
goes
on
and
the
company
continues
to
be
bound
by
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
interscience
had
only
one
plant
and
it
didn't
merge,
does
the
contract
has
to
be
expired
in
accordance
with
its
term
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
--
is
interscience
bound
the
next
day
after
the
expiration
of
the
contract
to
arbitrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
--
not
of
the
--
not
down
to
arbitrate
the
events
that
took
place
the
day
after
the
contract
is
terminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
that
--
that
you
might
have
the
--
the
company
might
have
the
obligation
to
pay
the
pension
plan
but
might
not
have
the
obligation
to
arbitrate.
and
then
it
might
be
--
the
company
might
be
able
to
recover
the
money
from
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
the
arbitration
clause
has
expired.
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
pay
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
any
item
--
would
any
--
would
any
matter
survive
the
contract
then
arbitration
--
the
arbitration
clause
automatically
survive,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
the
contract
didn't
terminate
in
that
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
that
event
or
that
set
of
fact
never
came
about
at
any
point
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
was
true
here.
by
the
time
you
asked
--
have
you
asked
arbitration
before
the
contract
expired
but
after
on
mr.
justice
brennan's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
hypothesis
there
was
a
dissolution
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
precisely
the
arbitration
clause
continued
into
effect
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
been
decided,
it
lasted
up
until
the
time
you
asked
that
you
requested
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
arose
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
exactly,
but
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
very
bootstrap
argument,
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
lieb,
do
you
--
do
you
feel
that
it's
absolutely
essential
for
you
to
establish
that
wiley
never
became
bound
that
all
who
knew
the
contract?
as
i
understand
the
union's
position
as
it
once
--
once
or
the
amicus
once
wiley
becomes
bound
to
the
contract
for
any
period
of
time.
then
it's
only
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
contract
as
to
whether
it
was
intended
in
any
part
to
survive
expiration
whether
by
virtue
with
its
own
terms
or
by
the
dissolution
of
a
--
of
a
bargaining
unit.
and
it's
only
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
to
say,
if
these
parties
intend,
for
example,
the
obligations,
or
vacation
pay,
or
seniority,
or
pension
rights
to
survive
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
that
is
what
i
gather,
they
are
the
same.
it's
only
a
matter
of
the
meaning
of
the
agreements.
certainly,
the
parties
could
aid
--
just
expressly
say
that
regardless
of
the
termination
of
the
contract,
certain
obligations
are
going
to
continue,
but
infinitive
in
perpetuity.
they
could
say
that.
the
union
claims
that
that's
what
the
contract
means.
and
that
--
that
the
arbitrator
is
the
one
who
should
interpret
it.
and
once
wiley
gets
on
the
line,
it
can't
get
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
if
it
--
what
if
the
court
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
the
law,
the
merger
does
not
automatically
terminate
an
agreement.
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
acquiring
company
is
bound
by
the
contract
if
there
is
no
dissolution
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
industrial
community
on
the
date
of
merger.
now,
what
if
the
--
assuming
the
court
decided
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
day
after
a
merger,
if
the
court
decided
that
the
merger
did
not
automatically
terminate,
the
day
after
merger,
wiley
would
be
bound
to
--
under
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
is
that
right
--
i
mean,
that
--
i'm
--
i'm
close,
i'm
consummating
that
the
court
did
decide
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
it
did
decide
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
i
--
i
grant
you
that
you
might
have
quite
facts
with
these
two,
but
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment,
just
assume
for
the
moment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
no
--
that
--
that
the
industrial
community
did
not
dissolve
on
that
day.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
didn't.
that
it
was
two
months
before
you
moved
any
employee.
you
left
them
right
in
that
plant.
now,
just
assume
that
for
the
moment,
then
wiley
does
become
bound
or
let's
assume
the
court
decides
that
it
did
--
if
we
made
that
wiley
became
bound
on
the
contract.
now,
is
there
--
is
there
any
other
way
out
for
you
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
out
of
the
cons
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
are
--
what
is
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
procedural
arbitrability
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
refused
a
procedural
arbitrability.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
another
way
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
include
in
your
--
in
your
other
ways
out
the
fact
that
once
wiley
became
bound,
it
cease
to
be
bound
because
the
contract
expired
or
because
the
bargaining
unit,
it
was
dissolved
in
a
later
date.
