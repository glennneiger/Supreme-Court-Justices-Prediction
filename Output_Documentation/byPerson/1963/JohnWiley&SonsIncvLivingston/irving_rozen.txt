mr.
irving
rozen
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
irving
rozen
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
first
of
all,
this
is
an
action
under
section
301
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
an
action
to
compel
arbitration
by
the
defendant.
mr.
irving
rozen
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
all
we
are
asking
here,
your
honors,
is
for
an
opportunity
to
go
before
the
arbitrator
and
have
the
arbitrator
tell
us
what
rights
passed
over
and
what
rights
continue
and
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for.
in
the
verdict
part
of
his
argument,
mr.
lieb
was
talking
about
rights
and
other
matters
as
if
we
were
here
now
before
an
arbitrator.
as
if
we
are
here
now
trying
to
pass
upon
what
these
rights
are.
we
aren't
asking
your
honors
to
tell
us
what
these
rights
are.
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
trilogy
cases,
steelworkers
cases,
that
is
not
part
of
this
court's
job.
if
that
--
that
is
for
the
arbitrator
to
determine.
mr.
irving
rozen
of
course,
not,
your
honor.
and
we
--
and
we
have
argued
in
that
brief
that
that
was
the
question
which
was
passed
upon
by
judge
medina
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
cite
numerous
and
copious
quotations
from
his
opinion,
where
he
specifically
held
that
the
matter
of
substantive
arbitrability,
whether
there
is
a
contract,
where
there
is
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
is
for
the
court.
and
he
held
that
this
court
finds
and
holds
that
there
is
such
a
promise
and
that
--
and
that
arbitration
should
proceed
therefore
on
the
question
of
what
the
rights
are.
the
only
question
that
he
left
open,
this
is
one
of
the
question
you
have
to
decide
here
by
your
honors,
is
the
question
of
procedural
arbitrability,
whether
or
not,
the
union
complied
with
conditions
of
the
contract
respect
the
grievance
procedure,
with
respect
to
grievance
steps
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
i
think
he
said
that
in
many
places
--
mr.
irving
rozen
i
do
not
think
so,
sir.
and
i
think
it's
clearly
set
forth
in
his
opinion
to
that
affect
in
many
places.
he
--
judge
medina
recognized
the
--
the
substantive
arbitrability
and
procedure
arbitrability.
our
--
our
action
was
against
wiley
and
wiley
alone
because
of
course
that
was
the
legal
entity
that
we
could
sue.
and
the
action
was
direct
to
proceed
against
wiley,
the
arbitrate
is
to
proceed
against
wiley.
the
only
thing
that's
left
open
is
the
question
of
what
the
rights
are
and
how
shall
those
rights
be
implemented.
i
think
that's
pretty
clear
from
the
opinion,
sir.
i
can
read
you
many
places
from
it
whereas
--
whereas
so
held.
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
understand
judge
kaufman's
opinion
in
that
respect.
but
i
must
be
frank,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
think
that
when
you
read
it
together
with
the
majority
opinion
and
where
you
read
the
fact
that
he
enthusiastically
agrees
with
it,
i
think
you
have
to
come
to
conclusion
that
the
majority
opinion
on
the
finding
that
there
is
an
obligation
by
wiley
to
arbitrate,
that
--
that
was
passed
upon
and
it
was
not
reserved
or
send
over
to
the
arbitrator.
we
all
agree
upon
that
question,
i
believe
that
--
that
it
is
the
court's
duty
to
determine
where
there's
a
promise
to
arbitrate.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
judge
in
the
lower
court
held
that
the
--
wiley
does
have
that
obligation
and
we
should
be
given
the
opportunity
--
mr.
irving
rozen
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
irving
rozen
we
urged
upon
him
your
honor
that
to
large
extent,
he
should
rely
upon
section
90
of
the
stock
corporation
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
because
the
stock
corporation
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
cases
of
merging
and
consolidations,
specifically
states
that
the
new
corporation
has
imposed
upon
it
all
the
obligations
of
the
old
corporation.
and
we
thought
that
was
a
very
persuasive
argument
but
mr.
justice
--
judge
medina
disagree.
he
said,
"no,
section
90
does
not
control
us.
under
lincoln
mills
case,
we
have
the
right
and
the
duty
to
fashion
our
own
federal
common
law
on
--
in
arbitration.
and
we
will,
as
a
matter
of
brand
new
burgeoning
federal
law
on
arbitration,
we
will
decide
ourselves
as
a
matter
of
common
law
what
the
obligation
is.”
and
he
went
through
--
they
took
into
consideration
section
90
and
--
and
replied
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
i
think
he
did,
sir.
i
think
new
york
cases
and
lincoln
mills
and
the
trilogy
cases
specifically
give
the
--
the
courts
the
duty
to
do
that,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
a
fashion
of
rule
of
--
of
labor
law,
of
common
law
in
arbitrations
as
to
what
the
limit
should
be
of
arbritatibility
and
arbitration
processes.
this
is
i
think
that
constitution
and
the
charter
and
the
by-laws
which
were
laid
down
by
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
case
and
the
trilogy
cases
as
to
what
the
federal
courts
must
do.
they
must
--
mr.
irving
rozen
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
sir,
that
that
is
the
fact.
you
--
you
must
bear
in
mind,
your
honor
--
mr.
irving
rozen
even
though,
they
haven't
specifically
agreed
to
arbitrate
in
writing
in
a
--
in
a
specifically
written
document,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes
--
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
rozen
exactly
so.
mr.
irving
rozen
exactly,
so.
mr.
irving
rozen
that
--
mr.
irving
rozen
--
states
it
exactly
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
if
you
read
the
whole
opinion
and
just
not
that
one
portion
--
mr.
irving
rozen
--
of
judgment
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
i
--
i
submit
sir
that
you
--
you
just
--
mr.
irving
rozen
--
can't
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
say.
thank
you
for
saying
it.
but
i
--
in
my
brief,
i
--
i
quote
from
several
places
of
judge
medina's
opinion
where
he
clearly
shows
that
he
understands
what
the
substantive
arbitrability
is.
he
clearly
understands
that
he
is,
in
fact,
holding
that
--
wiley's
obligation
to
arbitrate.
he
is
being
passed
upon
and
he
does,
in
fact,
direct
that.
and
i
think
that
the
whole
opinion
does
convey
that
distinct
and
definite
finding
and
holding,
sir.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
to
the
statements
made
mr.
lieb
about
when
the
physical
change
overtook
place.
but
this
does
not
appear
in
the
printed
transcript
of
record
but
it
does
appear
in
the
typewritten
record.
and
there
was
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals'
brief
by
mr.
lieb,
i'm
reading
from
page
5
of
his
court
of
appeals
brief.
i'm
reading
from
a
letter
that
wiley
sent
on
september
21,
1961
to
the
employees.
and
our
letter
clearly
shows
that
was
impossible
for
there
to
be
any
integration,
any
accretion,
any
disappearance
of
the
interscience
units,
until
long,
long
after
october
2nd,
1961
which
is
the
date
of
the
actual
technical
merger
in
the
secretary
of
state's
office
up
in
albany.
they
tell
the
employees
that
the
--
it
needs
to
be
for
long
when
suitable
quarters
have
been
arranged,
you
will
change
your
place
of
work.
until
the
move,
work
will
continue
as
now
at
these
offices,
meaning
the
interscience
offices
at
the
old
stand.
then
they
go
on
to
last
paragraph
and
say,
“plans
for
the
move
should
be
completed
within
a
few
months,
plans
for
the
move
should
be
completed
with
a
few
months.”
mr.
irving
rozen
we
don't
actually
know
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
fact.
i've
searched
the
record
carefully.
i've
looked
at
the
references
to
the
record
made
by
mr.
lieb
and
i
can't
find
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
i
would
say
it
may
depend
upon
where
the
labor
contract
is
being
tested.
i
would
say
that
if
it
was
being
tested
as
we've
tried
to
test
it,
that
the
--
the
contract
would
continue.
judge
medina
in
his
opinion
says
the
essence
of
this
case
--
mr.
irving
rozen
yes
sir,
it
does
because
the
contract
is
a
contract.
i
say
it's
a
sacred
document
that
has
to
be
observed
and
followed
and
--
and
until
it
reaches
its
end
either
by
operation
of
law
or
otherwise.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
it
is
bound,
sir,
to
arbitrate
rights
which
created
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
mr.
irving
rozen
if
--
if
those
events
which
took
place
the
day
after
the
termination
of
the
contract
have
no
relationship,
have
no
root
of
foundation
in
the
--
those
matters
which
grew
--
grew
up
or
accrued
or
became
vested
during
the
life
of
the
contract,
then
of
course,
arbitration
--
mr.
irving
rozen
--
could
not
be
held.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
rozen
this
is
really
a
question
which
should
not
be
asked
in
this
proceeding,
your
honor.
we
are
--
that
is
one
of
the
questions
we
are
asking
the
arbitrator
to
pass
upon.
this
is
what
judge
medina
says,
tempting
as
it
is
for
me
to
do
something
and
say
something
about
this.
i
must
resist
that
temptation
because
this
is
an
action
to
compel
arbitration,
an
action
to
go
the
arbitrator
to
give
the
arbitrator
a
chance
to
tell
us
what
those
answers
are.
mr.
irving
rozen
but
i
have
an
answer
for
you
if
you
want
it.
mr.
irving
rozen
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
we
would
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
there
might
--
possibly,
there
might
be
a
distinction.
mr.
irving
rozen
there
might
a
distinction
but
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
say,
no.
i
would
say,
even
though
the
arbitration
clause
has
expired
because
that's
the
end
of
the
contract,
i
would
say
that
the
obligation
to
make
contributions
to
the
pension
plan
were
--
were
vested,
were
created
--
were
--
a
right
that
during
the
life
of
--
of
the
contract.
let
us
a
take
a
case
for
example,
where
a
union's
been
in
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
company
for
let's
say,
25
years.
and
during
that
period
of
time,
there's
been
pension
plans
and
pension
contributions
enforced.
mr.
irving
rozen
and
each
year
they've
had
two
years,
each
two
years
have
had
negotia
--
did
you
ask
question,
sir?
mr.
irving
rozen
i
would
think
so.
yes,
your
honor
because
the
--
the
grievance
arises
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
their
vested
right
to
--
created
were
a
right
during
the
life
of
the
contract.
each
two
years
have,
in
the
example
i
was
about
to
propose
to
your
honor,
there's
been
negotiations
for
wages
and
other
things
and
the
--
the
most
important
attributes
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
is
a
pension
plan,
is
the
fact
that
when
i
get
to
be
65
or
more,
i'll
have
something
to
--
to
protect
me
in
my
old
age.
so
we
give
up
rights
for
--
for
increased
wages.
we
give
up
rights
for
vacation
pay.
we
give
up
rights
for
a
number
of
other
things
so
as
to
get
that
pension
plan,
to
get
those
pension
plan
contributions.
and
--
and
we
--
and
we
get
those
rights
in
that
way.
after
25
years
of
service,
the
company,
lets
say,
says
“no,
i'm
not
going
--
i'm
not
going
to
bargain
with
you
anymore.
we're
all
through,
we're
not
going
to
make
the
more
contributions
to
your
pension
plan”,
as
--
as
emphasized
in
this
case.
exactly
--
that's
what
exactly
happened.
and
as
--
as
the
employee
to
left
high
and
dry,
are
all
the
--
the
rights
which
has
been
created,
all
the
promises
that
were
made
from
all
the
years
of
--
of
bargaining,
all
to
go
for
north,
we
say
there
was
a
consideration
on
actual
legal
consideration,
a
quid
pro
quo,
every
two
years
for
that
pension
plan
contribution.
and
now,
there's
a
mere
fact
that
the
plan
--
that
the
company's
contract
has
terminated
according
to
a
termination
clause
in
the
contract,
does
that
mean
that
were
--
were
employees
go
through?
we
--
mr.
irving
rozen
we
say
did
not
terminate
in
that
respect.
we
say
that
this
arbitration
right
to
the
union
to
find
out
what
it
--
what
--
what
should
go
on
there?
what
should
happen
there?
and
this
is
what
we're
asking.
this
is
all
what
we're
asking.
we
really
shouldn't
be
engaged
in
this
discussion
at
all
because
this
is
the
ultimate
--
this
is
--
this
is
the
kind
of
discussion
i
expect
to
be
arguing
and
talking
to
when
i
get
before
the
arbiter,
if
i
had
to
get
to
there
with
your
honors
permission
of
course.
so
i
--
i
say
that
--
in
addition
to
our
letter,
i'd
like
to
read
you
or
mr.
lieb's
affidavit
at
page
58
of
the
record,
this
is
again
in
connection
with
the
physical
transfer.
and
he
here
is,
on
september
19,
1961
talking
to
me
and
to
my
associates
and
here's
--
here's
what
he
said,
“i
said
that
although
the
physical
transfer
for
me
to
sign
to
wiley
premises,
would
not
be
made
until
later
of
the
year.
it
was
wiley's
position
that
on
october
2nd,
automatically,
without
anything
more,
on
october
2nd
when
the
merger
became
effective,
the
collective
bargaining
unit
would
disappear
at
interscience
and
be
merged
and
be
absorbed
by
the
larger
wiley.
so
here,
i've
read
your
honors
two
statements
by
the
company
itself
telling
us
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
disintegration,
desecration
as
of
the
date
of
the
merger.
and
that
is
why
judge
medina
in
his
opinion
states
that
the
position,
on
page
89,
he
states
that
the
position
of
the
company
was
that
the
agreement
automatically,
this
is
an
exact
quotation,
"automatically
terminate
for
all
purposes,
the
agreement
by
the
consolidation."
so
i
say
to
you
--
your
honors
that
that
has
been
the
legal
question
of
law
that
judge
medina
passed
upon.
there's
no
factual
issues
before
him
because
the
company's,
as
he
finds
and
as
their
letter
shows,
took
that
position
and
on
october
2nd,
there
was
an
automatic
termination,
union
was
through,
the
employees
are
through,
no
more
rights,
nothing.
and
the
fact
is
that
nobody
knows.
the
record
does
not
show
when
it
did
take
place.
now,
i'd
like
your
honors
to
bear
with
me
while
i
explain
mr.
lieb's
statement
that
there's
no
prior
demand
for
arbitration.
i
concede
that
there
was
no
formal
document
asking
for
arbitration.
that
is
true
and
that
possibly
what
he
refers
to,
although
i
don't
think
so.
the
fact
is
from
june
27th
of
1961,
when
i
addressed
my
first
letter
to
mr.
lieb
advising
him
that
there
were
knowledge
of
the
impending
merger
and
our
insistence
upon
the
continuation
of
the
contract,
upon
our
insistence
upon
the
continuation
of
the
rights
of
the
employees
until
down
to
the
very
commence
of
the
action,
we
were
engaged
in
almost
one
long
continuous
process
of
--
of
talking,
of
negotiations,
of
trying
to
work
this
problem
out,
of
--
of
advancing
into
each
other's
arguments
and
issues
as
to
what
the
rights
of
employees
were
informed
to
do
something
about
it.
and
this
was
not
held
at
the
level
of
the
shop
steward
or
the
union
employee
in
the
shop.
of
course,
it
would
be
slightly
ridiculous
to
think
that
such
a
problem
could
be
handled
in
that
way.
this
was
handled
at
top
level.
mr.
lieb,
myself,
mr.
livingston,
the
president
of
our
union,
mr.
robinson,
the
secretary-treasurer
of
the
union
and
mr.
lobdell,
who
was
vice
president
and
treasurer,
i
believe,
of
wiley.
mr.
irving
rozen
exactly,
so.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
thought
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
irving
rozen
you
don't
reach
the
merits,
your
honors,
no.
but
i
wanted
--
i
wanted
to
talk
about
that
because
i
wanted
to
go
into
the
question
which
i
think
impelled
your
honors
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
procedural
arbitrability.
mr.
irving
rozen
there's
the
conflict
in
issue
in
the
various
circuits.
and
that's
the
question
you
have
to
decide.
but
i
wanted
to
lay
that
question
in
its
proper
background
because
otherwise,
wrong
impression
might
be
gotten
his
--
this
all
of
a
sudden,
out
of
the
blue,
we
start
an
action
without
any
prior
talks.
here
we
had
talk
after
talk
after
talk,
meeting
after
meeting,
conference
and
conference,
response
and
telephone
conversations,
all
discussing
these
issues
and
these
problems
and
trying
to
work
something
out.
and
we
told
them
time
and
again,
is
--
is
set
forth
in
our
affidavits
in
the
record,
we
told
them
time
and
again
that
if
we
couldn't
resolve
them,
we
would
have
to
go
arbitration,
we'd
had
to
go
to
litigation
and
they
--
could
--
we
couldn't
get
together
so
we
had
to
start
this
suit
as
--
as
--
which
is
now
here
pending.
mr.
irving
rozen
i
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
merits
of
that
issue,
i
do
think
so
because
i
think
that,
as
this
court
itself
held
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
the
only
question
is
--
i
think
you
do
have
to
reach
it,
your
honors,
because
it's
a
question
of
procedural
arbitrability
and
not
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
yes
they
are.
mr.
irving
rozen
oh,
yes.
mr.
irving
rozen
oh,
yes,
all
in
the
record,
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
what
we
--
we
were
advanced
in
--
in
our
motion
papers
in
the
district
court
in
our
affidavits,
it's
all
in
the
record.
but
i
think
if
--
i
think
you
have
to
decide
the
question
of
procedural
arbitrability
because
you
may
not
want
to
get
into
this
question
of
whether
or
not
this
constitutes
compliance
with
the
conditions
of
grievance
machinery.
i
mean,
i
want
to
get
into
whether
--
whether
there
was
a
waiver
by
the
defendant
by
them.
you
mean
i
want
to
get
into
the
question
whether
when
they
came
into
our
office
or
we
came
to
their
office
and
we
said
to
them
--
and
they
said
to
us,
“look,
there's
no
contract,
there's
no
union,
we're
just
sitting
down
here
without
prejudice,”
and
this
is
what
they
said
each
time,
“we
won't
never,
never
in
a
million
years,”
they
kept
saying
to
us,
"consent
to
your
theory
that
you
represent
these
employees,
that
these
employees
have
rights
as
we
can
do
something
for
you."
that
was
their
position
all
the
way
through
and
we
tried
to
argue
them
out
of
it,
we
try
to
work
something
out
with
them,
we
couldn't
do
it.
i
--
we
think
that
the
arbitrator
when
--
if
your
honors
agree
with
my
position
that
procedural
arbitrability
is
for
him,
we
think
the
arbitrator
will
ultimately
decide
that
issue
that
this
was
substantial
compliance,
that
there
was
a
waiver
that
the
--
that
the
arbitration
clause
does
not
call
for
this
--
for
step
by
step
adherence.
it's
at
page
--
i
think
you
should
read
the
arbitration
clause
at
page
27
of
the
record,
your
honor.
and
this
leaves
me
to
my
--
my
question
that
i'm
trying
to
discuss
now
as
to
whether
procedural
arbitrability
is
for
the
arbitrator
for
the
court.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
that
there
is
a
conflict
and
i
think
that
was
the
big
issue
in
this
case
as
to
why
this
court
was
kind
of
guess
as
to
why
this
court
grant
a
certiorari.
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
irving
rozen
well,
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
substantive
arbitrability
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
right
in
holding
that
wiley
--
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
rozen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
rozen
that's
right.
and
i'd
like
to
add
onto
that,
your
honor,
that
traditionally
--
mr.
irving
rozen
thank
you
very
much.
traditionally,
there's
been
a
distinction
between
an
"assets
deal"
so-called
and
a
"stock
deal"
so-called.
the
courts
have
held
that
where
you
buy
the
stock
of
a
corporation,
of
course,
the
corporate
entity
continues
and
the
--
and
the
corporate
--
corporation
continues
liable
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
where
you
have
an
assets
deal,
where
you
buy
merely
the
physical
assets,
then
possibly,
the
contract
does
not
continue
to
the
--
to
the
new
purchaser.
but
we
say
this
was
a
stock
deal.
that
was
one
of
our
arguments
to
judge
medina.
this
was
a
stock
deal.
a
merger
is
nothing
more
than
a
purchase
of
the
stock
of
one
corporation
and
--
and
giving
a
stock
the
other
corporation
exchange.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
