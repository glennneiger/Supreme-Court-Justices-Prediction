(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice

does
that
refer
to
these
five
or
six
issues
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
when
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
they
construe
the
agreement
as
requiring
of
those
questions
by
the
arbiters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
least
--
what
i'm
--
what
we
--
i
ask
you
a
question
is,
how
--
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
reach
the
question
whether
these
are
arbitrable
questions,
if
that
you
say
that
was
not
an
issue
made
in
the
--
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
complaint
asked
an
order
to
--
of
arbitration,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
still
puzzled.
if
that's
all
they
did,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
mean
when
it
construes
the
agreement
and
saying
that
these
issues
tendered
by
the
union
are
indeed
arbitrable
under
the
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
question
number
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
a
matter
of
--
of
one
of
the
effects
of
the
merger
under
that
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
it
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
an
assumption
then
that's
an
imposition
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
he
did
or
not,
you're
suggesting
that
the
union's
position
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
section
of
the
statute
imposed
the
obligation.
not
that
they
volun
--
that
wiley
voluntarily
assumed
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
is
(inaudible)
half
hour
ago
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
at
page
100,
at
least
that
much,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
did
not
obtain
that
under
the
court
of
appeals
decides
that
if
you
are
suable,
wiley,
then
the
issues
hounded
by
the
union
are
arbitrable
under
the
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
believe
you
suggest
that
you
had
to
rely
on
section
90.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you'd
now
said,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
position
is
this,
you
still
think
that
maybe
section
90
saddles
wallace
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
wiley?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
section
90.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
old
fashion
made
a
rule,
a
federal
law
which
will
govern
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
that
newly
fashioned
rule,
wiley
is
saddled
with
the
obligation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
you
tell
me
this.
would
you
mind
looking
at
page
94
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
judge
medina's
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
he
says,
“we
merely
hold
that
as
we
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
(inaudible)
we
cannot
say
that
it
was
intended
that
this
consolidation
should
preclude
this
union
from
proceeding
to
arbitration.
now,
for
proceeding
to
arbitration
to
what?
to
determine
the
effect
of
the
consolidation
on
the
contract,
as
well
as
on
the
rights
of
the
employees.
now,
why
isn't
that
what
judge
kaufman
said
it
was
at
page
110,
his
first
question,
“we
hold
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
clearly
a
rule
from
the
scope
of
arbitration
to
question
one,
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
a
whole
provide
the
consolidation
of
interscience
and
wiley?”
why
aren't
they
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
whole
opinion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
whole
opinion
just
utterly
confuses
me,
i
just
said
but
i
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
wonder
if
that
--
after
all
that's
in
the
language
of
holding
that
--
that
says
to
me
frankly,
mr.
rozen,
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
decide
whether
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
whole
survived
the
consolidation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
rozen
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
what
about
the
undertaking
the
pay
into
the
pension
plan?
suppose
interscience
or
whatever
the
--
this
company
is,
had
not
been
merged,
the
contract
ran
out,
weren't
able
to
negotiate
a
new
agreement,
three
months
after
the
expiration
date
and
not
a
payment
is
demanded
on
the
part
of
the
union,
would
interscience
had
to
pay
or
go
to
arbitration
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
answer
to
me
would
be
whether
or
not
the
company's
obligation
survive
the
termination
of
the
contract,
would
be
an
arbitrative
--
arbitrable
question
on
the
contract
itself.
justice
william
j.

well,
not
only
that

what

the
things
you
just
said
to
us
were
not

you
mean
about
all
these
conversations
with

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
mr.
lieb's
are
all
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

as
i
understand
mr.
lieb
to
say
that
the
program
by
which
the
change
over
from
the
old
interscience
to
the
wiley
building
and
the
--
and
the
intermeshing
of
--
both
the
workforces
and
everything
else
had
been
planned
to
the
union
knowledge
as
a
process
which
would
take
several
months
and
that
i
think
he
told
us
and
in
fact
that
from
about
october
2
to
about
january
1956
or
something
like
that.
now,
would
that
have
any
significance
on
--
on
your
position?
justice
william

brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

suppose
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
suppose
the
employer
had
announced
before
october
2,
a
shift
would
take
place
over
the
period
from
october
2
to
january
2,
and
it
did
in
fact
take
place
between
october
2
and
january
2.
does
that
make
any
difference
in
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

did
you
say
that
--
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
premise
that
they
were
dispersed
in
the
wiley
organization
when
according
to
a
plan
announced
to
the
union
on
--
that
would
be
made
effective
on
october
2
and
the
union
was
told
about
it
before
october
2,
and
in
fact
was
completed
by
january
2
according
to
plan
on
all
those
premises.
what
is
your
position
as
to
arbitration?
you
said
that
arbitrator
might
find
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
it
--
is
it
the
very
issue
here
whether
there's
any
obligation
to
arbitrate
at
all?
justice

j.
brennan,

even
though,
it
survived
only
according
to
this
plan

why
do
you
say

why
do
you
say

i
don't
follow
that.
justice
william

but
--
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
try
to
force
arbitration
until
after
january
2
as
i
understand
it,
and
you
brought
this
action
in
january
23
and
by
that
time,
on
a
hypothesis
i've
given
you,
the
bargain
unit
had
disappeared.
now,
why
--
what
--
what
about
the
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
is
that
merely
because
it
took
--
as
i
would
suppose
in
any
--
any
basis
of
common
sense
it
might
have
to
take,
a
little
while
to
complete
the
intermeshing
of
the
two
organizations.
by
the
time
you
got
around
the
seeking
arbitration,
the
old
unit
was
gone
on
my
hypothesis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
harris,
your
whole
case
depends
upon
this
set
of
facts
as
establishing
the
continued
existence
of
the
industrial
community,
does
it?
after
the
effective
official
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
which
is
to
say
then,
he
--
you
say
wiley
had
that
obligation
and
the
courts
so
hold.
as
i
understand
it,
by
reason
of
the
events
after
october
2
and
before
january
2
on
my
hypothesis,
you
say
it
doesn't
actually
so
in
taking
that
hypothesis.
you
say
that
wiley
is
bound
by
reason
of
the
events
between
october
2
and
january
2,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
effect
does
that
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.

that
doesn't
help
me
mr.

frankly.
i
thought

what
do
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.

you
may

i
don't
find

what

justice
william

(inaudible)
would
commence

it
has
been
announced

october

what
they're
now
asking,
reinstatement
(inaudible)
justice
william

and
this
on
the
ground,
as
i
now
understand
you,
i've
had
so
much
difficulty
with
mr.
harris.
don't
make
it
difficult
with
you
too.
as
i
understand
it,
what
your
--
your
position
is
that
wiley
--
no
obligation
of
wiley
to
go
to
arbitration
(inaudible)
that
on
october
2,
the
bargaining
unit
was
dead
finished
and
therefore
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
any
obligation
should
be
imposed
on
wiley
under
federal
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

alright.
