mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
if
the
court
please?
this
case
arises
out
of
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
of
the
nonsigner
clause
of
the
1936
ohio
fair
trade
law.
in
january
of
1958,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
--
rather,
of
the
state
of
ohio,
in
the
bargain
fair
case,
declared
the
nonsigner
clause
as
null
and
void
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law,
it
was
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
authority,
it
was
unrelated
to
the
police
power
of
the
state.
the
court,
however,
left
unprepared
the
doctrine
that
a
contract,
a
resale
price
maintenance
contract,
directly
between
a
manufacturer
or
other
authorized
person
and
a
vendor,
would
continue
to
be
lawful.
hudson
established
its
business
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
downtown
cleveland
in
the
summer
of
1958.
hudson
is
on
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
trademark
and
other
commodities
at
a
price
which
renders
it
a
profit,
however,
below
the
fair
traded
prices.
hudson
acquires
all
of
its
merchandise
from
a
wholesaler
in
the
state
of
michigan,
on
the
other
side
of
lake
erie,
so
that,
for
example,
upjohn
products
would
first
be
bought
by
the
wholesaler,
then
resold
to
hudson,
then
resold
to
the
consuming
public.
in
the
summer
of
1959,
the
state
of
ohio
passed
a
new
fair
trade
law,
june
29th,
1959,
to
take
effect
on
october
22nd,
1959
and
on
july
31st,
1959,
hudson
got
a
letter
from
upjohn
calling
attention
to
the
new
law
and
stating
that
upjohn
was
in
light
of
its
passage,
calling
attention
of
contracts
that
had
been
made
under
it
and
hudson
came
to
our
firm
and
asked
what
was
the
situation
and
so
we
checked
this
new
statute.
in
this
new
statute,
your
honors,
defines
a
contract
as
a
contract
arising
either
by
agreement
or
by
the
act
of
the
parties.
and
the
act
of
the
parties
which
brings
this
contract
into
effect
is
the
acquisition
of
a
trademarked
item
with
notice.
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
we've
never
seen
anything
quite
like
that
in
any
other
fair
trade
law.
we
subsequently
found
something
like
it
in
the
virginia
statute
but
prior
to
that
time,
there
was
nothing
like
it.
and
then
we
looked
at
that
statute
a
little
further
and
we
found
it
did
other
odd
things.
it,
for
example,
provided
that
a
proprietor
might
also
fair
trade
at
the
wholesale
level,
although
it
competed
with
its
wholesalers,
provided
that
the
proprietor
did
not
sell
at
a
price
different
or
other
than
the
wholesaler.
we
also
found
that
there
are
various
provisions
that
a
buyer
could
be
required
to
sell
only
to
persons
with
whom
it
made
a
resale
price
agreement
and
demand
to
the
buyer
that
it
too
get
a
comparable
contract
from
its
sub-vendee.
we
found
another
provision
that
the
seller
could
agree
to
bind
itself
on
making
a
sale
to
--
that
it
would
demand
of
the
next
buyer
that
it,
too,
observed
the
resale
price
maintenance
agreement
and
make
a
contract
of
a
sub-vendee.
we
also
found
a
provision
for
the
first
time
in
any
state
fair
trade
law
that
it
was
a
full
defense
to
the
action,
that
on
the
removal
of
a
trademark,
this
would
be
a
defense
to
the
resale
price
maintenance
contract.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
raised
these
constitutional
questions.
the
questions
must
have
been
passed
upon
in
accordance
with
the
ohio
statute
which
requires
the
appellate
courts
to
pass
upon
all
questions
raised
either
by
assignments
of
their
--
or
by
brief.
what
--
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
was
to
apply
the
premise
in
a
minority
--
in
a
minority
ruling,
in
a
3-to-4
ruling
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
sorry,
mr.
justice.
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
in
its
minority
ruling,
a
3-to-4
decision,
was
to
apply
the
premise
that
such
a
statute
achieved
validity
and
authenticity
solely
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
--
the
court
also
noted
the
completely
novel
nature
of
the
statute,
that
for
the
first
time,
the
conception
of
proprietary
interest
was
established.
in
other
words,
that
a
trademark
holder
or
trade
name
owner
must,
as
the
statute
says,
retain
a
proprietary
interest
in
his
product
and
that
upon
giving
notice,
a
contract
eventually,
the
doctrine
of
implied
contract,
therefore,
once
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
started
with
the
premise
that
this
was
wholly
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
must
necessarily,
by
the
statute
of
ohio,
have
overruled
our
contentions
and
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
judgment
which
was
put
on
the
books
by
the
minority
of
the
court
could
not
have
been
arrived
at
unless
the
very
clear
arguments
as
to
conflict
with
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
have
been
overruled
by
the
minority.
so,
not
to
leave
your
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
there
had
been
a
construction,
my
answer
is
that
there
was
an
overruling
of
the
contentions
that
we've
made
concerning
the
statute.
so,
your
honor,
then
we
looked
a
little
further
and
we
found
that
the
only
comparable
statute,
length
and
breadth
that
we
could
find
was
the
harris
bill,
the
first
harris
bill
of
1958
which
had
been
proposed
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
where
the
ohio
statute
followed
most
of
the
provisions
of
the
harris
act
in
the
conception
of
proprietary
interest,
in
the
conception
of
notice,
in
the
conception
of
the
abnegation
of
the
mckesson
&
robbins
doctrine,
in
the
conception
that
a
good
merchandizing
practice
at
all
levels
of
commerce
required
the
overruling
of
section
5
(a)
(5)
of
the
mcguire
act
and
in
the
conception
that
a
cooperative
enforcement
to
avoid
intra-brand
competition
was
most
desirable
because
i
think
that
some
of
the
literature
has
shown
that
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
mckesson
&
robbins
in
1956,
wholesalers
were
discounting
goods
in
commerce,
particularly
to
change
which
thereby
achieved
a
competitive
advantage
over
the
individual
retailer.
and
so,
with
these
propositions,
we
advised
the
client
that
we
should
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
accordance
with
a
time-honored
practice
that
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
injunctions
might
be
obtained
pursuant
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
client
might
well
be
put
out
of
business
before
it
constitutionality
could
be
determined,
this
action
was
so
filed.
the
action
specified
both
state
grounds
of
unconstitutionality,
federal
grounds
of
unconstitutionality
and
your
honors,
in
the
spring
in
1958,
on
the
second
amended
petition,
followed
by
an
answer
in
cross-petition
by
upjohn
in
which
enforcement
was
sought
and
where
the
upjohn
answer
admitted
and
the
policy
and
the
practice
of
establishing
and
enforcing
fair
trade,
the
matter
came
on
by
motion
for
immediate
trial
into
a
courtroom
with
upjohn
having
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
accompanied
by
18
affidavits
and
judge
mcneil
in
that
courtroom
said,
“now,
gentlemen,
we
have
had
one
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
judge
gusweiler
in
cincinnati,
we've
had
the
bargain
fair
case.
my
suggestion
is
that
you'll
sever
this
litigation
so
that
you
determine
constitutionality
on
the
petition
and
the
responsive
pleadings
and
leave
the
cross-petition
for
one
side"
and,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
also
have
another
peculiar
quirk
in
ohio
practice
whereby
we
have
no
mandatory
counterclaim
procedure
whatsoever.
there
is
nothing
like
federal
rule
13
of
the
frcp.
in
fact,
the
ohio
statute
say
that
at
any
time
prior
to
trial,
a
defendant
may
move
to
either
discontinue
his
cross-petition
or
cross-claim
when
there
is
no
difference
under
the
ohio
practice,
he
may,
thereby,
achieve
a
separate
docketing
if
the
trial
court
so
directs.
he
may,
upon
direction
of
the
trial
court,
thereby
avoid
special
supplementary
service
or
he
may
even
start
the
case
later
on
as
a
separate
proceeding
altogether.
perhaps,
a
very
old-fashioned
sort
of
practice
rule,
but
one
firmly
embedded
in
the
practice
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
so,
your
honors,
the
parties
in
this
proceeding
proceeded
accordingly.
we
did
just
that
and
we
proceeded
to
go
to
trial
upon
a
stipulation
of
evidence,
and
this
stipulation
of
evidence
included
affidavits
filed
by
the
appellant,
a
deposition
filed
by
the
local
manager
of
upjohn,
counter-affidavits
as
to
whether
or
not
the
upjohn
method
of
wholesaling
disclosed
actual
competition
between
the
wholesalers
and
upjohn
and
in
fact,
your
honors,
the
evidence
disclosed
the
del
credere
agency
pursuant
to
which
many
wholesalers
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
northern
ohio
did
actually
go
after
the
business
of
retailers
with
whom
upjohn
sold.
and
we
took
the
position
back
in
1958
and
continuously
down
to
the
present
time
that
within
the
teaching
of
masonite
and
the
more
recent
pronouncements
of
this
honorable
court,
the
del
credere
agency
clearly
can
establish
a
competitive
relationship
between
a
manufacturer
and
an
agent.
now,
within
the
clear
intent
of
the
parties,
your
honors,
every
constitutional
issue
was
thrown
wide
open.
therefore,
the
briefs
--
the
briefs
in
--
from
the
court
of
common
pleas
on
raised
the
issue
of
whether,
within
the
meaning
of
5
(a)
(2)
of
the
mcguire
act,
this
kind
of
contract
could
be
a
“contract
or
agreement”
within
the
sense
which
the
history
of
the
mcguire
act
taught
us,
in
other
words,
that
0it
had
to
be
in
the
nature
of
something
consensual,
something
consensual.
as
this
court
held
in
schwegmann,
contracts
and
agreements
follow
a
congressional
intendment,
not
to
be
decided
by
the
states.
we
checked
very
carefully
the
history
of
that
statute
and
we
found
that
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
whereby
the
term
"contract
and
agreement"
might
be
given
a
different
meaning.
in
fact,
in
the
section-by-section
analysis
of
the
statute,
section
5
(a)
(2)
is
described
as
referring
solely
to
contracts.
the
amendment
of
5
(a)
(2)
describes
a
permissible
vertical
contract
manufacturer
to
wholesaler
to
retailer,
they're
not
in
so
many
words,
but
whereby
the
fair
trade
contract
might
require
the
contractee
to
enter
into
another
contract.
the
section-by-section
analysis
further
made
perfectly
plain
and
clear
that
the
reversal
of
schwegmann
by
the
congress
took
place
in
terms
of
section
5
(a)
(3),
dealing
with
nonsigner
clauses,
nonsigners.
in
other
words,
that
where
a
policy
of
the
state
provided
that
a
remedy
of
unfair
competition
might
be
given
equally
against
both
signers
and
nonsigners
who
are
not
parties
to
the
agreement.
such
policy
might
be
enforced.
well,
now,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
we
no
longer
have
signers
and
nonsigners.
signers
and
--
we
didn't
have
those
at
all.
we
only
had
contractors
and
we
wondered
about
that,
and
so
we
got
the
reading
about
the
harris
bill
and
we
found
that
as
the
state
supreme
courts
continued
to
knock
out
the
nonsigner
clauses.
on
the
suggestion
of
professor
maclachlan
in
the
december
1957
vanderbilt
law
review
on
a
new
method
of
fair
trade,
representative
harris
had
introduced
this
bill
whereby
a
mechanism
would
be
established,
whereby,
upon
giving
notice
of
a
proprietary
interest,
everyone
would
now
be
bound.
there
wouldn't
be
--
there
just
wouldn't
be
anymore
nonsigner
problem.
and
this
proprietary
interest,
by
shifting
the
basis
of
fair
trading
throughout
the
united
states
would
create
a
method,
the
rationale
and
a
new
basis
of
interstate
commerce
for
being
better
able
to
have
an
orderly
marketing
of
goods
within
the
fair
trade
laws
free
of
rulings
like
vessel,
like
the
--
like
the
master
of
discount
house
of
washington
d.c.
cases
which
held
that
goods
might
be
shipped
from
a
nonsigner
state
into
--
rather,
into
an
non
fair
trade
area
into
a
fair
trade
area,
but
if
the
contract
were
closed
outside
the
fair
trade
area,
then
the
discounting
by
means
of
catalogue
shipments
was
perfectly
good.
it
would
also
give
a
rationale
basis
for
overcoming
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
mckesson
&
robbins.
it
would
also
give
a
basis
for
the
cooperative
enforcement
of
fair
trade
where,
if
this
court
please,
any
cooperative
enforcement
of
price
maintenance
in
commerce
would
be
suspect
and
interdicted
as
a
boycott,
none
of
which
the
mcguire
act
permits,
but
which
was
sought
by
the
proponents
of
fair
trade.
all
this
was
in
the
ohio
statute.
this
was
argued,
your
honors,
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
these
issues
were
raised.
these
issues
were
carried
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
judge
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
agreed
with
us.
he
thought
there
was
an
unlawful
delegation
of
the
ohio
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county
reversed.
and
in
its
extended
ruling,
specifically
mentioned
that
there
were
no
federal
issues
with
which
it
found
difficulty.
then,
we
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
i
might
add,
your
honors,
that
we
filed
a
--
an
application
for
rehearing
with
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county
in
which
we
raised
federal
issues.
and
the
upjohn
brief,
a
certified
copy
of
which
has
been
filed
with
this
court,
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county
on
the
ground,
perhaps,
that
court
had
really
now
encompassed
the
federal
issues.
we
were
told
by
upjohn
that
our
position
was
ludicrous
and
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
had
considered
such
issues.
then,
we
filed
our
motion
to
certify
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
on
the
grounds
of
great
and
general
public
interest
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
upjohn,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
no,
upjohn's
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
then
filed
our
motion
to
certify.
our
motion
to
certify
included
a
broad-gauged
statement
of
federal
issues
as
well
as
some
detail
of
the
federal
issues
now
before
the
court
and
upjohn
joined
in
our
motion
to
certify
on
the
ground
that
all
these
issues
should
be
disposed
of
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
your
honors,
our
briefs
in
the
supreme
court
raised
these
issues.
raised
the
issues
which
have
appeared
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
which
have
appeared
in
our
briefs
before
this
honorable
court.
now,
under
the
law
of
ohio,
where
as
stated
the
law
requires
the
appellate
court
to
pass
on
all
errors
and
briefs,
the
minority
of
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
our
state
sustained
the
statute
in
a
4-to-3
decision.
in
other
words,
we
won
the
battle
and
lost
the
war
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
upon
our
notice
to
certify,
rather
our
motion,
our
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court,
we
asked
the
clerk,
please,
to
send
to
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
all
documents
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
passed,
all
briefs
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
were
lodged
in
this
court
by
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
these
briefs
show
all
of
these
contentions.
in
other
words,
we
first
contend,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
contract
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
(a)
(2)
created
by
the
state
of
ohio.
in
other
words,
the
congressional
history
of
the
mcguire
act
must
show
some
sort
of
consensual
agreement.
it
is
not
enough
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
upjohn
gave
hudson
notice
of
a
third
party's
contract.

mr.
myron

krotinger
5
(a)
(3)?
well,
5
(a)
(3),
your
honor,
is
the
nonsigner
clause.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
right.
now,
the
nonsigner
clause
was
meant
to
accommodate
the
nonsigner
provisions
of
state
statutes.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
no,
your
honor.
it
does
so
but
on
the
theory
that
this
was
a
direct
contract
and
there
is
no
state
policy
which
makes
other
than
contractual
obligations
effective,
direct
--
direct
contract.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
it
does
not
apply
it.
in
other
words,
the
basic
policy
of
the
statute
and
may
i
read
from
the
legislative
history,
in
a
colloquy,
it's
the
record
at
page
226,
where
mr.
sweeny
is
talking
to
mr.
james
gorrell,
the
legislative
exponent.
“apparently,
from
your
house
bill
318,
you
have
attempted
to
get
around
the
provision
or
to
write
in
the
law
a
corrective
feature
whereby
notice
to
anyone
by
mail
or
otherwise
or
perhaps
markings
on
the
package
would
be
sufficient
to
bind
a
nonsigner
and
the
very
acceptance
of
his
product
for
sale
by
him
would
be
deemed
to
be
a
contract
with
the
manufacturer.
am
i
correct
on
that?
”
mr.
gorrell:
“that's
our
theory.
”
mr.
sweeny:
“one
or
two
observations,
then
there's
no
need
for
a
formal
written
contract
with
any
distributor
now.
”
mr.
gorrell:
“not
under
this
law,
true.
”
mr.
sweeny:
“and
one
further
thought
arising
from
my
ignorance,
under
what
theory
of
law
would
you
bind
the
third
party
to
a
contract
where
he
had
no
communication
whatsoever
with
the
manufacturer?
perhaps,
some
of
your
implied
warranty
features
are
along
that
theory?
”
mr.
gorrell:
“that
is
correct,
sir.
for
example,
a
recent
supreme
court
decisions
in
our
state
which
have,
in
effect,
knocked
out
the
old
idea
of
privity
of
contract,
we
are
suing
on
a
breach
of
warranty
where
it
is
said
you
had
no
direct
contractual
dealings.
"
the
court
has
said
that
is
a
pretty
adequate,
the
doctrine
has
refused
to
apply
it.
i
think
the
same
thing
would
apply
here.
this
court
knows
the
implied
warranty
theory
is
a
theory
of
tort
recovery.
it's
tort
recovery,
a
means
of
facilitating
recovery
by
an
injured
party.
in
fact,
mr.
gorrell
also
recognized
that
if
this
weren't
recognized
in
contract
theory,
there
would
be
a
constitutional
amendment
required
in
the
state
of
ohio.
and
at
page
269
of
legislative
record,
and
mr.
robinson,
one
of
the
sponsors,
said
to
mr.
gorrell,
“if
the
supreme
court
would
deny
fair
trade,
as
you
set
it
forth
here,
you
have
the
feeling
or
is
it
your
opinion,
we're
dealing
with
opinions
this
afternoon,
in
your
opinion,
there
is
only
one
other
answer
and
that
would
be
to
have
a
fair
trade
amendment
of
the
constitution.
”
mr.
gorrell,
“that's
our
feeling.
i
say,
it's
not
only
my
feeling
but
it
is
the
canvassed
opinion
of
lawyers
far
better
than
i
am
across
the
country.
”
in
other
words,
your
honors,
this
is
the
new
problem
of
fair
trade
arising
out
of
the
--
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
by
now
23
or
24
state
courts
around
the
united
states
of
their
respective
nonsigner
clauses.
now
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
basic
problem
that
now
comes
to
all
of
us
is
here,
we
now
have
a
fundamental
shift
in
the
basis
and
policy
of
fair
trade
law
around
the
united
states,
fundamental
shift.
the
miller-tydings
act
proceeded
on
the
theory
of
contract
or
agreement.
in
the
ruling
by
this
court
in
schwegmann,
the
court
discussed
the
requirements
of
contract
or
agreement.
in
the
1952
mcguire
act,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
discussed
contract
or
agreement,
it
never
--
never
discussed
proprietary
interest
or
another.
not
until
the
harris
bill
and
the
new
and
novel
theory
of
1958
and
professor
maclachlan's
suggestion
was
this
new
basic
notion
of
a
new
method
of
handling
a
fair
trade
broached
before
the
congress
and
the
american
public.
i'm
reserving
10
minutes
of
my
time.
may
i
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
--
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
lay
to
rest
this
ghost
that
the
issues
were
not
raised.
i
am
reading
from
the
brief
of
defendant-appellant
in
opposition
to
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
page
2,
a
certified
copy
of
this
brief
is
in
this
court.
none
of
the
plans
raised
by
the
applicant
for
reconsideration
in
the
instant
case
are
moot.
all
were
treated
far
more
extensively
in
the
original
briefs
submitted
to
the
court.
all
were
argued
orally
by
counsel
for
the
applicant
at
the
hearing
before
this
court.
applicant's
first
contention
was
at
the
court,
does
not
appear
to
have
considered
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
applicant
asserts,
requires
the
observance
by
this
court
of
the
mcguire
act.
applicant's
argument
does
not
include
a
single
authority
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention
initially.
starting
on
page
1
and
continuing
on
page
22
of
applicant's
initial
answer
brief
in
the
upjohn
company
case,
counsel
for
the
applicant
opened
up
the
very
same
attack
he
is
now
asserting.
more
importantly,
the
majority,
in
its
opinion,
clearly
considered
the
question
raised
by
federal
statutes,
so
that
applicant's
assertion
that
this
court
missed
the
“impact
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution”
boarders
on
a
ludicrous.
this
court
in
its
majority
opinion
discussed
the
evolution
of
federal
statutory
law
and
the
significant
federal
decisions
regarding
fair
trade
and
paying
state
in
detail.
the
court
properly
concluded
that
the
implied
contract
provision
of
the
new
act
did
not
offend
constitutional
provisions.
i
might
add,
i
omitted
one
sentence
in
which
the
court's
attention
was
also
pointed
out,
that
in
the
initial
answer
brief
in
the
eli
lilly
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
12
pages
are
devoted
to
development
of
the
same
point,
namely,
the
supremacy
clause.
we
then
go
to
our
brief
in
support
of
motion
to
certify
where
the
broad
gauge
second
issue
is
stated
in
accordance
with
sound
ohio
practice
to
“is
the
ohio
fair
trade
law
inclusive
violative
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
law
of
the
united
states?”
the
court
of
appeals
for
cuyahoga
county
answered,
“no.”
plaintiff-appellant
contends
the
answer
should
be
yes.
page
18
of
our
brief,
brave
questions
exists
as
to
whether
the
new
ohio
fair
trade
act
violates
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
by
exceeding
the
bounds
set
for
fair
trade
legislation
by
the
mcguire
act.
federal
enabling
legislation
requires
there
be
an
actual
contract
under
state
fair
trade
laws
not
mere
contracts
by
notice
and
so
we
go
on.
upjohn
joined
in
this
motion
to
certify
upon
these
grounds.
we
have,
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
in
this
court,
your
honor,
we
have
added
the
table
of
contents
of
each
of
our
briefs
in
each
of
the
courts.
we
also,
again,
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
section
2505.21
of
the
ohio
code
which
commands
appeals
taken
on
questions
of
law
shall
be
heard
upon
assignments
of
(inaudible)
in
the
clause
or
set
out
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellant
before
hearing.
the
suggestion
of
mr.
carson
that
we
have
omitted
part
of
the
statute,
which
would
leave
such
passage
discretionary
with
the
court,
is
i
don't
think
well-taken.
i
have
2505.21
with
sentence
which
was
left
out
and
as
to
which,
afterwards,
were
out.
in
its
decision,
the
reviewing
court
shall
specify
such
reassigned
errors
as
it
finds
or
shown
by
the
record
and
the
reasons
for
the
decision,
this
has
been
construed
as
referring
to
reversal,

settled
ohio
appellate
law,
these
were
contrary.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
a
companion
case
to
the
upjohn
case.
it
has
some
different
aspects.
its
history
and
how
it
arose,
follow
in
many
respects
the
upjohn
litigation
following
the
effectiveness
of
the
ohio
fair
trade
act
or,
rather,
its
passage
in
june
of
1959.
on
october
1st,
1959,
hudson
was
nullified
by
eli
lilly
&
co.
that
eli
lilly
will
continue
to
vigorously
support
fair
trade
and
which
is
to
give
you
notice
of
this
policy.
this
letter
invited
hudson
to
enter
into
a
contract.
this
invitation
was
to
--
was
not
taken
up
and
on
december
10th,
1959,
a
warning
letter
was
sent
from
eli
lilly
to
hudson
informing
of
the
information
that's
come
to
eli
lilly
of
sales
below
fair
trade
prices,
again,
enclosing
duplicate
copies
of
the
fair
trade
agreement,
enclosing
"we
trust
your
future
operations
will
be
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
obligations
imposed
upon
you
under
the
ohio
fair
trade
act
so
there
will
be
no
need
--
occasion
for
any
further
controversy
or
litigation."
the
--
hudson
filed
its
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
22nd
of
october,
1959.
this
was
followed
by
this
warning
letter
and
then
by
a
second
warning
letter
of
january
26th,
1960
in
which
hudson
was
told,
"we
are
prepared
to
file
suits
for
injunctions
where
contract
violations
cannot
be
worked
out
in
a
voluntary
basis
and
we
trust
your
future
operations
will
be
in
accordance
with
your
obligations
under
the
contracts
and
under
the
ohio
fair
trade
act."
in
other
words,
the
demand
was
made
that
hudson
observe
both
the
provisions
of
the
ohio
--
rather,
of
the
lilly
contract,
as
well
as
the
fair
trade
pricing.
as
in
upjohn,
a
cross-petition
was
filed.
responsive
pleadings
were
filed
both
to
the
petition
and
the
cross-petition,
and
the
case
moved
into
a
courtroom.
unlike
upjohn,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
evidence.
again,
like
upjohn,
the
litigation
on
the
hudson
pleading
--
rather,
on
the
complex
of
pleadings
was
limited
solely
to
the
petition,
the
answer
and
the
reply.
the
rulings
made
by
the
courts
below,
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
court
of
ohio
were
all
made
in
the
--
both
cases
as
written
by
the
court.
and
as
stated
to
the
court
yesterday,
the
issues
before
the
courts
were
limited
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
the
state
and
the
federal
constitutions.
now,
your
honors,
as
we
noted
yesterday,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
limited
and
placed
its
ruling
solely
upon
the
issues
of
the
state
of
ohio
constitution.
it's
as
if
the
federal
law
did
not
exist
and
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
was
misled
or,
at
least,
adopted
the
positions
set
forth
both
by
upjohn
and
by
lilly
in
their
briefs,
excuse
me,
namely,
that
the
federal
law
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
legality
of
the
ohio
fair
trade
act.
this
position
was
taken
both
by
lilly
and
by
upjohn
forthrightly
in
the
court
below,
and
net
result
was
that
we
have
a
situation
where,
in
the
brief
of
eli
lilly
&
co.
in
this
court,
the
claim
is
made
that
a
valid
contract
was
instituted
under
the
ohio
fair
trade
act
under
section
5
(a)
(2).
seven
pages
of
the
lilly
brief
in
this
court
are
devoted
to
that
proposition.
in
fact,
your
honors,
at
page
48,
48
or
49
of
the
lilly
brief
in
this
court,
lilly
argues
such
a
contract
is
within
the
common
law
meaning
of
a
contract
that
is,
under
section
1333.31,
an
implied
contract.
williston
states
that
a
contract
may
arise
from
a
“sellers
making
a
general
offer
to
all
the
world
in
this
way
to
be
accepted
by
taking
ownership
on
the
property,
provided
consideration
could
be
found
from
the
promise
of
the
purchaser
and
also,
such
communication
to
the
promisee
as
is
necessary
for
a
contract.”
the
next
sentence
of
this
section
of
williston
which
deals
with
notices
on
merchandise
is
to
the
effect,
if
the
ultimate
purchase
is
not
from
the
offeror
but
from
one
who
has
acquired
from
him
absolute
and
unqualified
ownership,
it
would
seem
impossible
to
treat
the
purchase
of
the
property
as
consideration
for
a
promise
of
the
purchaser
to
the
original
seller,
unless
it
leads
to
the
facts
warranting
the
assumption
that
the
immediate
seller
demanded,
as
part
of
the
consideration
of
the
sale,
a
promise
to
the
original
seller.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
only
if
the
federal
law
so-permits,
your
honor.
under
section
5
(a)
(2),
this
court
has
held
and
has
plainly
held
repeatedly
that
the
words
“contracts
and
agreements”
in
the
mcguire
act
are
to
be
taken
in
their
ordinary
and
usual
meaning.
in
the
ordinary
and
usual
meaning
of
the
term,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
a
notice
is
not
a
contract.
a
notice
of
another
man's
trademark
is
not
a
contract.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
except,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
issue
in
the
case
is
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
exemption.
in
other
words,
where
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
committed,
in
our
opinion,
basic
error,
is
impending
this
case
and
the
validity
of
a
fair
trade
contract
and
price
fixing
in
commerce
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
rather
than
as
a
grant
of
federal
exemption.
the
issue
is
a
federal
one.
indeed,
your
honor,
whenever
a
claim
has
been
made,
either
by
private
party,
administrative
agency
or
government,
that
a
price
fixing
contract
is
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
anyone,
the
federal
court,
as
in
schwegmann,
looked
at
the
statute
and
said,
“are
there
critical
differences
between
the
federal
act
and
the
state
statute?”
in
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
well,
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
by
stating
that
the
question
is
perhaps
stated
over-broadly
in
that
you
would
--
you
would
suggest
by
the
question
that
there
was
a
total
commitment
of
price
fixing
for
the
states
by
the
mcguire
act
without
relevance
to
the
federal
standard.
and
i
would
again
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
rulings
of
the
court,
this
court
foreclosed
that
approach.
contracts
and
agreements,
signers
and
nonsigners
have
been
two
of
the
most
bitterly
litigated
terms
in
american
legal
history
where,
for
example,
the
mcguire
act
was
passed
in
1952
to,
one,
due
to
the
results
of
schwegmann.
this
was
by
means
of
the
nonsigner
concept.
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
that
act,
there
were
45
fair
trade
acts
in
effect,
each
of
which
contained
a
nonsigner
clause
committed
to
the
concept
of
signer
and
nonsigner.
the
congress
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
the
image
and
contour
of
those
statutes.
section
5
(a)
(3)
said,
states,
"we
will
now
allow
you
where
you
have
nonsigner
clauses
to
make
them
operative.”
beyond
that,
the
congress
did
not
go.
it
said
in
section
5
(a)
(2),
“you
may
enter
into
contracts
and
agreements.
the
section-by-section
analysis
of
the
bill
talked
about
contracts.”
the
congress
further
said,
“you
may
enter
into
contracts
by
which
you
may
require
your
contractee
to
enter
into
a
further
contract."
a
statutory
system
was
created
and
with
that
statutory
system
came,
as
professor
mclaughlin
pointed
out,
the
resentment
of
holding
a
man
to
a
contract
he
never
made,
so
that
over
this
basic
nonsigner
clause
came
this
round
of
litigation
through
the
different
states
whereby
24
such
states
have
now
held
that
the
nonsigner
clause
is
ineffectual.
now,
we
find
a
different
solution
upon
a
different
basis
with
a
different
premise
in
commerce
undertaken
by
the
state
of
ohio
based
upon
what
was
originally
a
national
solution
to
a
hotly
contended
economic
issue
but
which
one,
basically,
was
a
matter
of
national
policy
and
as
this
court
pointed
out,
there
has
been
no
subject,
perhaps
in
american
history,
so
closely
patrolled
as
the
price
fixing
agreement.
excuse
me?
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
a
typical
little
four-sectioned
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
--
statute
designed
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
oh,
yes.
lilly
signed
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
what
the
ohio
court
did
was
to
construe
the
statute
as
if
there
were
a
nonsigner
policy
in
the
state
of
ohio
in
violation
of
the
federal
provisions.
section
5
(a)
(2)
permits
the
enforcement
of
contracts
between
lilly
and
those
who
have
signed,
perfectly
valid.
by
section
5
(a)
(3),
the
nonsigner
provisions
might
be
enforced.
a
minority
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
held
that
it
could
not
reverse
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county,
finding
such
statute
to
be
constitutional.
however,
your
honor,
the
basic
issue,
now
occur,
is
the
interpretation
of
contracts
and
agreements
in
federal
law.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
that's
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
that's
right.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor,
it
is
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor,
it
is
not
satisfied
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
it
is
not
satisfied
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
but
it's
not
satisfied
as
to
hudson
because
the
only
way
in
which
hudson
can
be
cabined
in
to
a
price
fixing
agreement
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
it's
a
nonsigner.
therefore,
what
this
statute
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
only
where
the
policy
of
the
state
is
to
permit
such
enforcement
and
the
policy
of
the
state
of
ohio
is
to
abandon
the
nonsigner
technique
and
may
i
quote,
your
honor
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
in
a
state
where
by
definition,
the
state
legislature
has
said,
“we
are
binding
only
signers”
and
may
i
point
out
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
here
by
mr.
gorrell,
the
--
who
was
the
sponsor
in
the
legislature,
in
enacting
the
new
ohio
fair
trade
act,
at
page
32,
the
ohio
legislature
decided
to
shift
the
emphasis
from
the
nonsigner
concept
and
to
develop
contractual
rights
and
obligations
between
the
proprietor
of
a
trademark
or
trade
name
and
the
retailer
desiring
to
use
that
mark
in
the
sale
of
products.
now,
this
provision
in
ohio,
your
honor,
was
gotten
from
virginia,
which
had
a
notice
provision,
after
the
virginia
courts
had
held
a
nonsigner
clause
not
to
be
binding
within
the
state.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
right.
now,
in
the
case
of
zale-norfolk
against
bulova
watch,
a
nonsigner
--
rather,
a
nonsigner
was
before
the
court,
practically
on
all
force
with
the
facts
in
this
case,
where
zale-norfolk
had
proceeded
to
buy
merchandise
from
a
wholesaler
other
than
bulova.
bulova
went
to
court
and
said,
“we
want
to
find
out
where
you
got
that
merchandise
and
we
also
want
to
bind
you,”
and
the
virginia
court
said
a
fair
trade
contract
or
rather,
a
fair
trade
statute,
referring
to
contracts,
means
voluntary
contracts,
“we
are
not
going
to
resurrect
the
nonsigner
clause.”
so,
the
interpretation
of
the
virginia
courts
was
that
the
statute
was
not
binding
upon
a
nonsigner.
now,
may
i
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
no,
upon
state
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes.
now,
the
parity
of
policy
of
a
federal
ground
also
bars
the
enforcement
against
a
nonsigner
in
the
state
because
the
only
ground
in
the
federal
law
is
where
there
is
a
nonsigner
policy
in
a
state,
and
we
see
clearly
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
this
is
now
construed
as
a
contract.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor,
this
--
now.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
well,
except
this,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
now,
may
i
state,
your
honor
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
and
this
denies
the
entire
basic
concept
of
what
the
state
legislature
in
ohio
was
doing.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that,
by
means
of
a
play
upon
words,
signer
or
nonsigner,
a
contract
which
we
have
here
in
court
this
morning
and
a
--
and
a
statute
calls
a
signer,
what
is
a
nonsigner,
contrary
to
the
federal
intent
because
what
this
concept
does
is
to
destroy
any
distinction
between
section
5
(a)
(2)
and
5
(a)
(3).
everybody
is
now
a
contractor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor,
i
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
signatures.
there
is
no
form
as
such
in
the
fair
trade
law,
but
the
term
“signer,”
as
construed
in
schwegmann
case,
in
the
mckesson
case,
in
the
entire
history
of
the
mcguire
act,
means
a
contractor
is
one
who
has
evidence
to
consensual
agreement
in
such
form
--
in
some
form,
where
within
the
valid
conception
of
contractor
agreement,
we
may
find
one.
may
i
further
point
out,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
what
the
implication
is
of
saying
that
there
is
no
longer
any
difference
between
a
signer
and
a
nonsigner.
it
means
that
all
the
states
which
have
been
struggling
with
this
conception
of
signer
and
nonsigner,
the
basic
matrix
of
the
miller-tydings
act
and
the
mcguire
act,
this
suddenly
disappears
in
a
concept
of
everybody
is
a
contractor
on
an
implied
theory
of
notice
where
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
makes
a
notice,
except
by
prior
to
the
legislature,
which,
in
turn,
depends
upon
the
will
of
congress.
the
further
factor
is
that
this
is
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
well
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
your
honor
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
it
--
this
is
what
the
statute
was
intended
to
accomplish.
mr.
gorrell
said
so,
this
is
all
through
the
legislative
hearings,
and
in
fact
the
dialogue
in
the
legislature
was
to
the
effect.
a
mr.
rod
turned
to
mr.
gorrell
and
he
said,
“mr.
gorrell,
why
don't
you
please
get
us
into
a
contract
fill
where
you
--
we
at
least
employ
a
third-party
beneficiary
contract
between
a
wholesaler
who
sells
to
the
defendant
and
the
manufacturer?”
and
mr.
gorrell
said,
“well,
we
can't
find
a
very
much
in
the
way
a
contractual
theory
there
because
suppose
the
wholesaler
never
made
such
a
request
to
the
--
rather,
of
the
retailer.”
and
to
this,
mr.
rod
said,
“well,
then
what
do
we
do?”
and
mr.
gorrell
replied,
“well,
that's
the
reason
we
join
the
crowd,
shuffling
up
on
the
law
of
privity
of
contract
in
the
implied
warranty
cases,”
implied
warranty.
may
i
state
further,
your
honor
that
this
conception
is
found
embedded
in
the
matrix
of
the
statute
where
a
proprietary
interest
is
found,
a
wholly
new
concept
which
is
found
for
the
first
time
in
the
1958
and
1959
congressional
legislation.
in
other
words,
this
concept
in
the
ohio
statute
does
not
stand
alone.
it
is
part
of
a
much
larger
system
designed
to
overturn
the
basis
of
the
mcguire
act.
i
should
like
to
reserve
10
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
pardon
me?
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
of
course,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
an
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
right.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
as
to
which
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
regards
policy
and
i
might
add,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
this
is
the
reason
that
the
court
and
the
proponents
of
the
statute
analogized
this
proprietary
interest
is
novel
theory
to
a
house,
a
candy
bar,
an
apple,
in
other
words,
as
if
our
client,
when
they
bought
the
lilly
trademarked
product
in
michigan,
bought
something
analogous
to
a
(inaudible).
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
it
treats
everybody
as
a
contractor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
within
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
federal
(inaudible),
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time,
your
honors.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
mr.
willis
is
reading
of
the
legislative
history
is
a
reading
after
the
event.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
is
a
reading
after
the
event.
congress
never
so
understood
such
a
legislative
history.
the
legislative
--
the
understanding
of
congress,
as
shown
by
the
harris
bill
report,
house
report
1253
of
june
9th,
1959
when,
for
the
first
time,
a
proposal
appeared
in
congress
to
add
notice
to
the
statute
to
amend
the
mcguire
act,
at
page
18,
states
the
only
change
proposed
in
paragraphs
2,
3
and
4,
that
is
the
mcguire
act,
is
to
where
reference
to
notices
in
the
provisions
referring
to
contracts
and
agreements.
this
change
is
made
so
that
where
a
state
law
permits
a
manufacturer
to
establish
a
stipulated,
a
minimum
resale
price
by
the
giving
of
notice,
the
mcguire
act
provisions
will
apply
to
the
same
extent
they
do
now
in
the
case
of
state
laws
which
permit
the
establishment
of
such
prices
by
contracts
or
agreements
between
manufacturers
and
the
distributors.
your
honors,
there
has
never
been
so
closely
cabined
as
the
piece
of
legislation
as
the
mcguire
act
which
was
subject
to
a
vicious
three-way
fight
through
both
house
of
the
congress.
i
have
here
the
house
release
from
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
--
the
house
report.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
no,
sir.
in
no
sense
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
only
the
mcguire
act
of
1952
and
the
miller-tydings
act
and
may
i
state,
your
honor,
in
the
section-by-section
analysis
of
this
statute
at
page
5
of
the
house
report,
paragraph
2
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
on
--
on
the
hr
5767,
the
1952
house
report,
your
honor.
paragraph
2,
with
the
two
exceptions
referred
to
below,
this
paragraph
contains
substantially
the
same
provisions
as
those
contained
in
the
first
proviso
of
the
miller-tydings
act.
in
substance,
this
paragraph
provides
that
neither
the
federal
trade
commission
act
nor
any
of
the
antitrust
acts
shall
make
unlawful
a
contract
proscribing
minimum
or
stipulated
prices
for
the
resale
of
a
trademarked
commodity
in
open
competition
of
other
commodities.
this
paragraph
differs
from
the
miller-tydings
act
in
two
respects.
first,
it
includes
a
provision
expressly
covering
contracts
which
proscribe
stipulated
prices.
such
contracts
are
not
expressly
covered
by
the
miller-tydings
act.
second,
it
includes
a
provision
expressly
covering
a
contract
which
requires
a
vendee
to
enter
into
another
contract.
in
other
words,
your
honors,
nobody
in
1952
thought
about
notices.
it
wasn't
even
an
issue
before
the
congress.
this
is
all
reading
back
after
the
event.
and
as
mr.
priest,
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee,
as
shown
in
our
brief,
said
to
the
congress,
“our
purpose
is
to
let
the
laws
now,
in
effect,
operate
as
they
operated
from
1937
until
the
date
of
the
schwegmann
relief,
the
laws
then
in
effect.”
now,
your
honors,
the
effect
of
the
broadened
reading
that
mr.
willis
would
like
to
give
us
would
be
to
state
that
the
state
of
ohio
can,
for
example,
take
a
proprietary
interest
concept
in
the
old
dearborn
case
which
was
made
in
1936
in
an
intrastate
transaction,
without
relationship
to
a
federal
enabling
law,
take
a
formula
and
a
standard
which
wasn't
even
mentioned
in
the
miller-tydings
act
and
the
mcguire
act.
and
so,
now,
we
say,
in
1958,
the
notice
was
contemplated
by
the
congress
in
1952,
not
at
all.
the
proprietary
interest
of
1958
was
contemplated
in
1952,
not
at
all,
not
a
word
about
this.
why
do
we
get
both
notice
and
proprietary
interest
in
1958,
because
this
is
the
third
round
of
fair
trade
legislation?
this
is
the
solution,
your
honors,
and
the
answer
to
the
declarations
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
nonsigner
clauses
in
24
states
and
where
the
congress
points
out
in
the
report
on
the
harris
bill
that
unless
we
do
this,
fair
trade
is
dead
in
16
states,
now
24
and
this
is
the
manufacturer's
means
of
giving
notice
of
his
proprietary
interest
and
reestablishing
his
rights.
this
history
you
have
been
hearing,
your
honors,
is
after
the
event,
reading
events
of
1952
backward
in
a
way
which
was
never
contemplated
at
the
time
and
which
any
reasonable
reading
of
a
legislative
history
will
show.
point
2,
your
honors,
we
come
to
the
business
of
the
due
process
issue
and
how
it
was
raised
and
its
reasonable
scope.
your
honors,
due
process
--
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
n.
krotinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron

krotinger
section
5
(a)
(3)
may
not
be
enforced,
your
honor.
section
5
(a)
(3)
turns
upon
state
policy
and
i
reiterate
to
your
honors
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ohio
legislation
was
to
solve
the
problems
of
fair
trade
and
not
as
was
done
in
1952
by
adding
the
nonsigner
clause
but
to
redefine
a
conception
of
contract
so
as
to
eliminate
the
problem
altogether.
the
problem
is
solved
by
killing
it.
there
is
no
longer
a
signer
or
nonsigner
case.
thank
you
(inaudible).
