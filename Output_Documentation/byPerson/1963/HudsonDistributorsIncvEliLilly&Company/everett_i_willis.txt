mr.
everett
i.
willis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
the
notice
question
that
mr.
krotinger
has
been
discussing
and
then
discuss
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir,
it
was
raised,
but,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
it
--
it
is
not
raised
by
the
facts
of
this
case
because
there
were
contracts
and
there's
an
unadjudicated
question
of
interpretation
of
the
ohio
act
as
to
whether
the
contracts
are
only
permitted,
which
they
clearly
are
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
--
for
our
rebuttal.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir,
it
was
raised.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
i
do
not
deny
that.
i
do
not
--
not
deny
that.
i
want
to
discuss
that
and
i
want
to
discuss
one
other
question
which
is
heavily
stressed
on
the
merits
in
--
in
the
brief
of
hudson
and
was
not
raised
in
the
pleadings
of
the
case,
indeed,
until
the
reply
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
but
it's
--
it's
stressed
in
the
brief.
now,
i
want
to
discuss
that.
if
i
have
time,
i
will
make
one
or
two
observations
on
the
jurisdictional
aspect
after
i
discuss
the
merits
but
i
think
it's
important
to
get
to
the
merits
first.
now,
hudson's
argument
does
boil
down
to
this.
oh,
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing.
a
major
difference
between
the
upjohn
case
and
the
lilly
case
is
that
the
mckesson
&
robbins
case
issue
that
was
discussed
yesterday
based
on
the
claim
that
upjohn
has
agreements
with
wholesalers,
although
it
competes
with
them,
is
not
an
issue
in
the
lilly
case.
it
was
stipulated
between
the
parties
as
a
fact
that
lilly
does
not
sell
to
any
retailers
and
therefore,
does
not
compete
with
its
wholesalers
and
that's
--
so,
that's
not
in
the
case.
now,
due
process
has
been
raised.
i
don't
think
i
need
bother
to
discuss
that
beyond
what
is
in
our
brief.
there
can't
be
any
question
about
the
applicability
of
the
old
dearborn
case
here.
there's
a
rather
timorous
suggestion
that
it
ought
to
be
reconsidered.
it's
a
bedrock
decision,
a
30-year
standing.
it
was
a
unanimous
court.
the
due
process
clause
reads
exactly
the
same
now
as
it
did
then.
now,
on
--
on
the
notice
question,
hudson's
argument
just
is
that
the
mcguire
act
sanctions
only
state
statutes
which
require
at
least
one
express
contract
before
you
combine
all
the
rest
of
the
retailers
in
the
state
by
notice.
now
--
and
that
the
ohio
act
exceeds
that
congressional
mandate
because
it
permits
fair
trade
enforcement
by
notice
only.
now,
that
just
is
not
the
meaning
of
these
statutes
or
their
interrelationship.
i
--
i
have
no
hesitation
making
the
flat
statement
that
if
one
reads
the
mcguire
act
with
the
objective
of
giving
effect
to
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
enacting
it,
it's
not
possible
to
conclude
that
it
doesn't
permit
what
ohio
did
here.
congress
intended
it.
i
realize
it
had
to
say
it,
too,
in
the
statute
but
it
did
say
it.
now,
what
was
the
background
of
the
mcguire
act?
in
1937,
congress
had
enacted
the
miller-tydings
act.
it
didn't
mention
nonsigners.
as
we
have
now
been
told
by
the
house
report
on
the
mcguire
act,
congress
intended
in
the
miller-tydings
act
to
permit
fair
trade
to
be
enforced
against
all
alike,
whether
parties
to
a
contract
or
not.
congress
thought,
as
we
have
now
been
told
in
the
house
report
that
there
wasn't
any
sherman
act
violation
anyway
without
a
contract.
and
if
you
--
and
if
congress
said
the
state
law
may
authorize
the
contract,
enforcement
against
--
enforcement
rights
against
nonsigners
would
follow
automatically.
now,
unfortunately,
the
language
that
congress
used
in
the
miller-tydings
act
didn't
reveal
its
intention
with
unmistakable
clarity
and
so,
in
the
schwegmann
case,
this
court
held
the
sherman
act
bans
not
only
expressed
fair
trade
contracts
but
the
implied
obligation
that
arises
when
a
purchaser
with
notice
acquires
goods
and
then
uses
the
trademark
which
has
been
notified
the
subject
to
the
price
restrictions
in
the
resale.
and
the
court
held
congress
didn't
articulate
its
intention
to
accept
from
the
sherman
act
that
implied
obligation.
now,
what
did
congress
do
then?
it
very
promptly
passed
the
mcguire
act
and
this
time,
to
make
sure
nobody
could
misunderstand
its
intention
again,
it
laid
it
out
in
about
10
or
12
different
ways,
both
in
the
house
report
which
explained
and
recommended
the
mcguire
act
in
the
very
form
in
which
it
passed
and
in
the
act
itself.
let
me
just
review
briefly
what
they
did
say.
in
the
house
report,
first,
they
said,
in
substance,
“we
intended
the
miller-tydings
act
to
permit
state
fair
trade
acts
to
be
enforced
with
respect
to
the
implied
obligation
reaching
with
respect
to
the
fellow
who
purchases
with
notice
and
then
uses
the
trademark
and
cuts
the
price.”
then
they
said,
in
the
schwegmann
case,
it
was
held
to
the
contrary.
we
overruled
it,
not
part
of
it,
all
of
it.
they
said,
“we
want
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
congress
means
to
let
these
state
fair
trade
acts
operate
and
be
enforced
in
their
totality”
and
they
didn't
stop
there.
they
said,
“we
want
to
remove
any
federal
obstacle
to
a
broader
interpretation
of
the
state
fair
trade
laws
in
interstate
commerce”
and
lest
anybody
think
that
they
were
only
talking
about
just
the
fair
trade
contracts
that
were
in
--
then
on
the
books,
they
said,
“we
think
the
states
should
be
permitted
to
experiment
further
with
fair
trade
legislation”
and
they
still
didn't
stop.
they
said,
“so
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned,
we
want
to
leave
the
states
free
to
protect
their
trade
against
these
predatory
price
practices
in
the
manner
best
known
to
them.”
now,
that's
the
house
report.
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
their
purpose.
now,
let's
see
whether
this
time,
they
were
able
to
find
the
english
words
to
give
effect
to
--
to
reveal
the
purpose.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
well
--
well,
it's
--
yes,
it
is,
yes,
it
is
in
a
reference
to
the
house
report,
which
is
house
report
no.
1437,
82nd
congress,
second
section
--
second
session,
february
27,
1952.
now
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
the
quotes.
i
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
alright.
well,
it's
all
there.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
all
--
all
that
i've
said
is
in
the
brief,
yes,
sir.
all
that
i've
said
is
in
the
brief.
now
--
now,
let's
look
at
the
--
at
the
act
itself.
we
know
what
the
purpose
was.
let's
see
if
they
were
able
to
say
it.
in
the
first
place,
the
preamble
of
the
act
says
that
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
states
to
regulate
their
internal
affairs
by
adopting
laws
and
policies
authorizing
the
enforcement
of
fair
trade
prices
against
all
alike,
whether
parties
to
a
contract
or
not.
there
are
more
words
than
that.
that's
the
substance.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
oh,
yes,
sir.
under
--
under
the
state
fair
trade
laws
and
under
the
ohio
law,
if
the
owner
of
a
trademark
enters
into
contract
specifying
minimum
prices
for
resale,
these
are
vertical.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir,
minimum
prices
for
resale.
those
--
those
contracts
are
made
lawful.
it
is
also
made
lawful
to
enforce
those
prices
against
one
who
hasn't
signed
any
contract
if
he's
notified
that
“this
is
our
trademark
and
if
you
acquire
the
goods
and
if
you
use
our
trademark
in
the
resale,
you
don't
use
the
trademark,
it
doesn't
matter,
if
you
use
our
trademark
in
the
resale,
this
minimum
price
applies
to
you
even
though
you
are
not
a
party
to
the
contract,”
so
the
preamble
said,
as
i
have
recited.
now,
when
they
got
to
the
main
operative
provision
of
--
in
paragraph
2
of
the
mcguire
act,
they
did
not
just
repeat
the
language
that
this
court
had
regarded
as
applying
only
to
express
contracts.
they
said,
“we
want
any,
any
contracts
or
agreements
that
are
lawful
under
the
state
law
for
resale
price
maintenance
to
be
enforceable
despite
the
sherman
act.”
now,
i
note
in
passing
that
that
phrase
--
that
in
using
that
phrase
“any
contracts”,
they
were
using
a
phrase
that
this
court,
many
years
ago,
had
construed
when
the
phrase
was
included
in
another
federal
statute
to
be
comprehensive
enough
to
include
“not
only
expressed
contracts
but
contracts
which
arise
by
implication.”
now,
to
further
forestall
any
misinterpretation,
they
said
--
they
added
paragraph
3
to
the
act
which
said
that
"the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states
were
not
to
prevent
the
exercise
or
the
enforcement
of
any
right
or
any
right
of
action
created
by
any
state
statute,
state
law
or
state
policy
against
a
person
willfully
failing
to
observe
state
fair
trade
prices,
whether
party
to
a
contract
or
not."
now,
lest
anybody
might
think
that
they
were
putting
the
states
in
a
straight
jacket
of
just
the
fair
trade
laws
they
had
then,
both
in
paragraph
2
about
the
contract
and
in
paragraph
3
about
enforcement
against
parties
not
party
to
a
contract,
they
said,
“we
mean
contracts
and
rights
of
enforcement
recognized
by
state
statutes
now
or
hereafter
in
effect.”
and
in
paragraph
3,
they
said,
"this
nonsigner
enforcement
we're
talking
about
is
the
enforcement
permitted
by
any
state
statute
which,
in
substance,
provides
that
willfully
and
knowingly
disregarding
the
prices
is
actionable.”
and
then,
i
think
this
is
about
number
12
on
the
list.
to
--
to
just
put
an
additional
copper
rivet
in
it,
they
added
paragraph
4,
which
said,
"none
of
these
contracts,
any
contracts
in
2,
none
of
these
enforcement
rights
under
3
shall
constitute
an
unlawful
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
restrain
on
interstate
commerce
or
interference
with
the
interstate
commerce."
now,
this
time,
congress
left
nothing
to
the
imagination.
it
didn't
whisper
its
intention.
it
--
it
roared,
it
repeated
itself
and
it
underscored
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
a
part
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they're
made
by
congress.
and
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
this
time
that
they
meant
to
accommodate
the
right
of
the
states
to
permit
vertical
resale
price
maintenance
as
they
saw
fit.
now,
hudson
has
a
chivilla
for
this.
they
say,
well,
this
ohio
act
permits
fair
trade
enforcement
by
notice
only
and
the
mcguire
act
requires
at
least
one
express
contract
before
you
combine
the
other
2000
by
notice.
now,
among
other
things,
that
assumes
facts
that
are
not
in
this
case.
lilly
established
its
fair
trade
prices
by
express
contracts
with
1400
retailers,
65%
of
the
retailers
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
gave
notice
to
all
the
others
of
the
prices
established
in
those
contracts.
and
furthermore,
the
argument
assumes
an
interpretation
of
the
ohio
statute
that
the
ohio
courts
have
not
made.
the
ohio
statute
can
be
read
to
mean
that
you
establish
your
price
in
the
first
instance
by
an
express
contract
and
control
it
from
thereon
by
contracts
or
notices.
now,
i
don't
say
that's
inevitable
that
it
has
to
be
read
that
way,
but
it
could,
particularly
if
it
was
thought
they
were
a
constitutional
question
if
it
were
interpreted
the
other
way
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
the
ohio
supreme
court
didn't
discuss
the
matter,
if
you
look
at
page
402
of
the
upjohn
record
where
the
court
of
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
yes,
it
says
“establish
and
control
by
contract
or
by
notice”.
now,
just
--
there
isn't
a
comma
after
establish
but
suppose
there
were,
it
would
say
“establish,
and
control
by
contract
or
notice”.
you
see,
it
could
--
it
could
be.
i
don't
say
it's
compelling.
at
page
402
of
the
upjohn
record,
the
court
of
appeals
did
interpret
the
--
the
ohio
statute
that
way.
they
--
after
reciting
that
they
adopted
an
act
which
--
that
ohio
adopted
an
act
somewhat
enlarging
on
the
virginia
act
and
--
and
by
the
way,
on
the
reference
to
the
ball
of
the
case
where
he
said
the
--
that
the
virginia
courts
held
that
remote
parts
wasn't
as
good.
the
virginia
statutes
differ
for
one
thing.
the
ohio
statute
says
and
the
virginia
statute
does
not,
whether
buying
from
the
original
vendor
or
not,
but
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
referring
to
the
ohio
system
of
resale
price
maintenance,
this
is
accomplished
by
fixing
fair
trade
prices
by
contracts
with
other
retailers
with
notice
of
such
prices
to
the
retailer
involved
and
the
retailer
then
purchasing
such
articles
for
resale
on
the
retail
market
with
knowledge
that
under
the
law,
he
has
impliedly
contracted
to
maintain
fair
trade
prices
by
purchase
for
resale
under
such
circumstances.
now,
the
--
the
relationship
of
the
nonsigner,
under
ohio
law,
is
one
of
implied
contract.
that
made
a
difference
in
ohio
because
the
courts
had
held
if
it
wasn't
contractual,
it
wasn't
--
ohio
requirements
weren't
satisfied.
the
ohio
legislature
created
that
as
a
method
of
entering
into
a
contract
by
action
of
the
party
and
the
courts
then
said,
in
this
case,
ohio
requirements
are
satisfied.
now,
i
want
to
mention
one
other
thing
that
mr.
krotinger
--
he
cited
williston
on
common
law
which,
of
course,
ohio
is
not
bound
by
whatsoever,
but
he
quoted
a
provision
that
indicate
that
there
might
not
be
a
contract
if
the
purchaser
was
remote,
in
other
words,
not
the
immediate
purchaser
but
one
further
down.
we
must
always
distinguish
between
the
commodity
and
the
trademark.
nobody
acquires
ownership
of
our
trademark
when
they
buy
the
goods.
now,
i
say,
whether
it
was
an
implied
contract,
it
made
a
difference
in
ohio
but
under
ohio
only.
federally,
it
made
not
slightest
difference
whether
the
state
denominated
this
relationship,
a
contract
or
not.
if
it's
an
implied
--
if
you're
in
a
state
that
calls
it
an
implied
contract,
then
it's
clearly
enforceable
under
paragraph
2
of
the
mcguire
act.
if
it
isn't
a
contract,
but
there
are
contracts
with
others
and
hudson
is
notified
of
the
prices
in
those
contracts,
then
it's
--
it's
--
hudson
is
caught
under
paragraph
3.
and
since
here,
it's
both
an
implied
contract
and
there
are
other
contracts
of
which
it
had
notice,
it's
got
under
both
so
the
only
difference
it
makes
federally
is
which
section
you're
proceeding
under.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
other
question
which,
as
i
say,
is
briefed
but
has
not
been
discussed
by
mr.
krotinger
and
that
is
their
argument
that
section
29
(b)
(2)
of
the
ohio
act
permits
horizontal
agreements
between
competitors
and
horizontal
boycotts
and
therefore,
cannot
apply
in
interstate
commerce
because
of
paragraph
5
of
the
mcguire
act.
now,
the
provision
he
bases
it
on
is
the
provision
in
paragraph
29
(2)
that
says
that
a
fair
trade
contract
may
require
a
vendee
to
obtain
fair
trade
contracts
from
those
to
whom
he
resells
on
resale,
an
exact
counterpart
of
the
same
provision
in
paragraph
2
of
the
mcguire
act.
this
wasn't
in
the
miller-tydings
act
but
congress
is
taking
no
chances
this
time
and
it
put
it
in
and
it's
--
and
it
wasn't
anew.
this
is
not
an
ohio
invention.
every
fair
trade
act
in
the
country
had
such
a
provision
in
it
in
one
form
of
words
or
another
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
mcguire
act.
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
of
hudson
is
that
the
resale
by
the
vendee,
who's
required
to
get
further
contracts,
might
be
a
competitor
and
if
so,
paragraph
5
of
the
mcguire
act
would
prevent
one
retailer
from
getting
a
fair
trade
contract
from
another.
well,
if
that's
so,
and
i
think
there's
a
lot
of
argument
as
to
whether
it
is
so
that
i
won't
go
into,
but
suppose
it
is
so,
well,
then
the
same
is
true
under
section
34
of
the
ohio
act
which
similarly
prevents
contracts
between
retailers,
between
wholesalers
and
between
manufacturers
and
that
provision
of
section
34
limits
every
provision
of
the
ohio
act
unless
specifically
excluded
and
section
29
(b)
(2)
does
not
specifically
exclude
it.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
sir.
oh,
no,
it
did
not.
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
this
--
this
question
wasn't
raised
in
the
pleadings.
it
wasn't
raised
in
hudson's
petition.
the
court
of
common
pleas
was
never
heard
of
until
the
reply
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
not
that
i
know
of.
now,
of
course,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
provision
in
lilly's
expressed
fair
trade
contracts
like
this
that
the
vendees
have
to
get
a
--
a
fair
trade
contract
on
resale.
i've
been
arguing
a
little
bit
hypothetically
because
the
argument
i'm
meeting
is
hypothetical.
hudson's
argument
is,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
expressed
contract
of
lilly
that
requires
the
retailer
not
to
resell
to
fair
trade
violators
and
he
says,
as
i
understand
it,
hudson
says
this
is
enough
like
the
29
(b)
(2)
provision
that
it
may
be
impliedly
authorized
and
--
and
involve
the
horizontal
ban
and
--
and
so
--
and
--
and
therefore,
it's
not
a
good
provision.
now,
i
should
say
that
it's
doubly
hypothetical.
there
is
no
--
not
a
word
in
the
record,
no
claim
that
lilly's
--
has
entered
into
any
horizontal
agreements
with
anybody.
there's
no
suggestion
and
there
couldn't
be
that
lilly
or
anybody
else
had
refused
to
sell
to
hudson.
indeed,
mr.
krotinger's
statement
that
lilly
called
upon
hudson
to
observe
this
paragraph
6,
this
refusal
to
sell,
to
the
provision
is
not
supported
by
the
record
if
you
look
at
the
very
warning
letter
that
he
referred
to,
it's
at
page
17
and
18
of
our
record.
you
will
--
you
will
see
that
the
only
obligation
that
they
referred
to
on
hudson's
part
was
an
obligation,
“you
are
obligated
to
uphold
our
minimum
retail
resale
prices,
whether
you've
signed
the
contract
or
not”
and
in
the
cross-petition
in
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
only
injunctive
relief
they
sought
against
hudson
--
lilly
sought
against
hudson
was
injunction
against
disregarding
the
fair
trade
prices,
no
other,
no
other
provision
of
the
contract.
now,
the
ohio
courts
have
not
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
may
i
just
ask
where
--
where
you
were
reading
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
that's
--
that's
a
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
you
see
--
well,
that
was
a
reference
to
that
provision
of
the
ohio
act
and
then
there
as
a
statement
that
the
mcguire
act
only
permits
enacting
legislation
authorizing
contracts
prescribing
minimum
resale
prices.
there
were
no
--
no
reference
at
all
to
this
paragraph.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
i
believe
so.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
to
that
extent,
yes,
sir.
no
reference
at
all
to
section
5
(a)
(5)
of
the
mcguire
act
or
to
paragraph
6
of
our
--
of
our
contract.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
section
5
(a)
(2)
and
5
(a)
(3)
of
the
mcguire
act,
5
(a)
(5)
is
the
one
that
would
raise
this
question
and
--
that
is
said
to
raise
this
question.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
i
suppose
you
might
say
it
was
handed
out
there.
now,
the
ohio
courts
have
not
said
whether
this
paragraph
seeks
refusal
to
--
to
sell
is
or
is
not
authorized
by
the
ohio
act
by
section
29
(b)
(2).
i
must
say
that
in
most
states,
the
refusal
to
sell
is
a
permissible
method
of
enforcement
because
one
fundamental
aspect
of
fair
trade
is
that
if
you're
going
to
have
a
program,
it's
got
to
be
uniform
against
all
alike,
not
let
some
go
merrily
along
violating
while
the
others
comply,
but
the
ohio
courts
haven't
said.
now,
if
it
is
alright
under
paragraph
29
(b)
(2)
in
the
ohio
court
note,
then
it'
also
alright
under
paragraph
2
of
the
mcguire
act
because
it
has
the
same
provision.
if
it
runs
afoul
of
paragraph
5
of
the
mcguire
act,
it
also
runs
afoul
of
section
34
of
the
ohio
act
and
if
it's
not
a
good
provision,
the
ohio
act
can't
be
tainted
by
it.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
ohio
act.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
lilly
can
enforce
a
particular
contract
provision.
they've
made
no
attempt
to
and
we
don't
know
whether
they
can
or
not,
very
frankly.
now,
let
me
make
one
last
assumption.
let's
suppose
paragraph
6
isn't
authorized
by
either
act
or
although
the
reasoning
by
which
this
might
be
done
eludes
me,
let's
suppose
we
could
find
that
it
is
authorized
by
the
ohio
act
but
not
by
the
mcguire
act,
it
--
it
wouldn't
make
the
slightest
difference.
paragraph
9
of
the
same
lilly
contract,
our
record
at
page
14,
says
this,
“this
contract
shall
be
interpreted
under
and
shall
be
subject
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
fair
trade
act
of
the
state
in
which
the
retailer
does
business.
and
in
the
event
any
provision
of
this
contract
shall
be
held
invalid
under
such
act
or
any
other
statute,
law
or
public
policy
or
to
be
held
inapplicable
with
respect
to
any
given
set
of
facts
or
circumstances,
then
or
in
either
such
events,
this
--
that
provision
is
severed
out
of
the
contract
and
the
rest
of
the
contract
remains.
so
even
if
paragraph
6
were
bad
under
the
ohio
act,
it
just
couldn't
under
this
--
it
would
be
severed
out
and
couldn't
apply
to
intrastate
commerce.
if
it's
good
under
the
ohio
act
but
not
good
under
the
mcguire
act,
well,
paragraph
9
says
you
sever
it
out
in
interstate
commerce.
it
just
doesn't
apply.
now,
i
--
i
believe
--
i
submit
that
if
there
was
ever
a
case
in
which
congress
went
to
unusual
lengths
to
guarantee
that
its
decision
to
turnover
to
the
states
a
particular
area
of
regulation
would
not
be
thwarted.
this
is
that
case.
the
will
of
congress
was
thwarted
once
or
the
intention
of
congress,
i
should
say,
when
the
miller-tydings
act
was
held
not
to
be
enforceable
against
persons
who
hadn't
signed
a
contract
and
to
be
sure
that's
congress'
own
fault,
that
can
be
laid
to
the
fact
they
didn't
use
enough
words
in
the
miller-tydings
act
to
reveal
their
real
intention,
but
this
time,
they
have
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
will
of
congress
should
not
be
thwarted
a
second
time.
now,
i
--
i
believe
i
have
time
to
say
just
a
brief
word
about
the
jurisdictional
aspect
and
i
want
to
refer
particularly
to
a
question
which
was
raised
yesterday
in
the
course
of
the
upjohn
argument.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
the
house
report
on
the
mcguire
act
was
no.
1437.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
1437.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
and
it's
the
82nd
congress,
second
section
--
session
and
is
dated
february
27,
1952.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
it
appears
on
that
page
and
on
other
pages
shown
at
page
ix
of
our
index.
there
are
a
number
of
references
to
it.
now,
on
jurisdiction,
we
have
briefed
fully
that
we
believe,
and
we
do
believe,
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
the
question
was
asked
yesterday,
suppose
these
questions
were
raised
in
the
ohio
courts
but
the
ohio
courts
just
didn't
discuss
them,
does
that
preclude
jurisdiction
in
this
court?
well,
stated
in
that
way,
of
course
not,
of
course
not.
but
there
are
some
pretty
rigid
requirements
to
get
these
questions
properly
raised
and
decided
and
before
this
court
and
it's
the
burden
of
the
appellant
to
show
that
he
has
got
them
here.
the
questions
have
got
to
be
properly
raised
below
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
--
under
ohio
practices,
including
them
both
in
the
assignments
of
error
and
in
the
brief,
and
preserving
them
from
one
court
to
another
and
not
raising
it
here,
skipping
the
intermediate
court
and
then
raising
it
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
it
has
to
be
properly
raised.
furthermore,
it's
got
to
be
either.
actually,
to
bring
the
question
here,
either
actually
decided
by
the
courts
so
you
can
read
it
and
see
it
or
it's
got
necessarily
to
have
been
decided
in
the
sense
that
there
are
no
possible
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
under
which
the
court
could
have
been
concluded
that
the
constitution
was
violated
because
the
statute
is
not
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
raise
it
and
then,
finally,
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
this
case,
must
be
final
and
here
in
our
case,
as
in
the
upjohn
case,
there
has
been
a
remand
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
or
two
other
questions
that
are
being
raised
here
are
--
have
been
raised
in
the
remand
proceedings
and
yet,
they
say
they're
here
and
so,
i
believe
that
the
--
that
this
appeal
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
not,
if
your
honors
retain
jurisdiction,
i
think
it's
as
clear
as
the
english
language
could
make
it,
that
the
mcguire
act
carefully
and
explicitly
and
completely
almost
repetitiously
authorized
what
ohio
has
done
here
and
the
judgment
holding
the
ohio
act
constitutional
should
be
affirmed.
