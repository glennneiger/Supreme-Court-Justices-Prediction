justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
ohio
court
--
that
these
points
had
been
raised
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
before
the
ohio
court
and
they
just
ignored
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
think
that
we
ought
to
send
it
back
to
the
ohio
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
real
question
is,
this
--
if
they
were
raised
in
the
--
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
urged
there
in
briefs
or
otherwise
or
it
--
or
it
consists
with
the
rule
and
then
the
court
said
none
of
the
constitutional
attack
have
merit,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
were
--
were
the
other
federal
points
raised?
do
you
designate
the
points
on
appeal
or
--
or
just
brief
them
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
were
the
federal
questions
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
were
not
raised
in
the
lower
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
agree
that
they
were
presented
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
supreme
court
of
ohio.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
presented.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
never
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
was
never
raised
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
he
even
have
to
say
that
in
the
supreme
court
when
he
hasn't
urged
the
point
on
the
--
upon
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
did
raise
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
presented
it
to
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
have
your
--
i
don't
suppose
ohio
changes
its
law
in
putting
in
this
new
statute
because
of
any
federal
law.
it
did
it
to
--
to
avoid
its
own
state
constitutional
ruling,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
would
suppose
you
would
concede
that
in
a
state
--
that
--
that
ohio's
previous
law
would've
been
fully
constitutional
under
the
mcguire
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
allowed
you
to
--
this
allowed
you
to
get
release
against
nonsigner.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
and
i
also
gather,
you
concede
that
in
this
case,
there
were
many
actual
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
lilly
and
upjohn.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
both
the
evidence
of
these
agreements
were
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
makes
you
think
that
the
ohio
court
construed
its
act
as
though
there
were
no
agreements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
--
it
--
you
--
you
say
that
even
if
you're
right
on
what
the
federal
law
requires,
that
it
requires
actual
consensual
agreement,
not
an
implied
obligation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
if
you're
right,
the
federal
law
is
satisfied
here
because
there
were
some
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
many
of
them
are
actual
agreements.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
true
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
--
both
lilly
and
upjohn
had
several
agreements,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
is
a
nonsigner.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
federal
offer
permits
enforcement
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
federal
law
would
bar
the
state
from
permitting
nonsigners
to
be
--
to
be
proceeded
against
by
--
by
an
implied
contract
rather
than
by
no
contract
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
their
own
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
just
like
--
just
like
the
majority
of
the
--
of
the
court
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
--
on
state
constitutional
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
started
out
talking
about
federal
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
ought
to
keep
talking
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
nonsigner
policy
in
ohio.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
nonsigner
policy.
it's
just
that
--
that
they
justify
proceedings
against
nonsigners
in
a
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
instead
of
saying
that
there's
no
contract
that
will
hold
them
anyway,
we
will
say,
by
law,
there's
an
implied
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
doesn't
make
them
a
non
--
where
anything
else
whether
it's
a
nonsigner.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
krotinger,
you've
got
two
different
points
here.
one
is
that
--
that
you're
saying
that
the
ohio
law
doesn't
require
contracts
at
all.
that's
one
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
point
was
the
one
that
you
and
i
were
discussing,
namely,
that
ohio
has
abandoned,
you
say,
the
so-called
nonsigner
policy
which
is
a
little
different
point,
a
little
different
point.
as
to
the
first
point,
there
were
contracts
in
this
case
and
the
ohio
courts
knew
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
you
could
say
with
confidence
that
the
ohio
courts
construed
their
statute
in
the
absence
as
a
--
as
a
valid
in
the
light
of
the
mcguire
act
even
though
there
were
no
contracts.
that's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
first
point
but
on
the
second
point,
your
--
your
issue
is
--
your
--
your
argument
is
that
--
that
ohio
doesn't
treat
nonsigners
as
non
--
as
non-contracting
parties
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
that
unless
the
state
really
treats
them
as
a
nonsigner,
non-contractually
bound,
it
violates
the
mcguire
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
outset,
do
you
concede
that
the
notice
--
as
to
the
notice
question
that
it
was
raised
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court,
it
was
raised
in
the
appellate
courts
of
ohio.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
depends
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
depends
on
what
you
think
the
scope
of
the
notice
question
is
but
anyway,
the
notice
question,
however
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
probably
raised.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
include
the
ohio
law
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
willis,
in
--
the
complaint
in
this
case,
it
seems
the
--
there's
this
allegation
that
the
ohio
law
provides
that
after
giving
notice,
a
proprietor
may
require
the
distributor
to
sell
it
not
less
than
a
minimum
resale
price
as
stipulated
by
the
proprietor
and
may
further
require
the
distributor
not
to
sell
to
any
other
distributor
without
first
obtaining
an
agreement
from
such
other
distributor.
he
will
not
sell
it
at
price
that's
less
than
the
minimum
resale
prices.
now,
is
this
the
horizontal
argument
that
you've
been
talking
about
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
was
reading
--
well,
actually,
i
was
reading
out
of
the
upjohn
record,
out
of
the
upjohn
record
at
page
12.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
second
amended
petition
for
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
read
you
what
the
--
maybe
you
did
--
was
--was
this
the
same
--
is
the
complaint
the
same
in
the
lilly
and
the
upjohn
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
just
read
out
of
the
--
out
of
his
petition
which
refers
to
the
ohio
acts
permitting
a
distributor
--
forbidding
a
distributor
to
sell
to
other
distributors
without
first
obtaining
an
agreement
to
sell
only
at
these
prices.
this
is
a
horizontal
arrangement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
goes
right
on
and
says
that
it's
contrary
and
inconsistent
with
a
section
of
the
sherman
act
as
admitted
by
the
miller-tydings
act
and
the
mcguire
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
i
--
is
this
the
--
is
this
the
issue
though,
the
--
the
business
about
selling
to
the
other
distributors,
is
this
the
horizontal
issue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you're
talking
about?
