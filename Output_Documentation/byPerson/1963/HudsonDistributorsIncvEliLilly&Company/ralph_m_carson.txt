mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
presenting
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
appellee,
upjohn
company,
i
beg
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
parallel
and,
yet,
slightly
different
position
of
these
two
appellees
in
489
and
490
where
mr.
krotinger
will
argue
for
appellant
in
each
and
mr.
willis
will
follow
me
in
speaking
for
the
appellee,
lilly.
these
cases
are
essentially
similar
and
yet,
there
are
differences
in
details
which
may
be
important
on
the
two
appeals.
i
refer
for
a
definition
of
what
i've
just
said
and
a
definition
of
the
jurisdictional
point,
mr.
krotinger
has
just
talked
about,
to
the
record
and
may
i
say
in
passing
that
what
i've
heard
in
the
appellant's
presentation
is
not
very
familiar
to
me
from
the
record.
at
page
380
of
the
large
brown
record
in
the
upjohn
case,
we
have
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county.
in
the
two
cases,
lilly
and
upjohn,
in
the
fifth
line
of
justice
skeel's
opinion,
both
cases
involved
some
of
the
facts
and
with
the
questions
to
be
determined
by
this
court
the
same
in
each
case,
the
appeals
will
be
considered
together.
the
assignment
of
error
is
identical
in
both
cases.
now,
what
is
that
assignment?
you've
heard
mr.
krotinger
paint
at
large
the
numerous
constitutional
points
he
raised.
the
quotation
by
the
ohio
court
is
“for
its
assignment
of
error,
defendant-appellant
asserts
that
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
trial
court,
of
cuyahoga
county
erred
in
declaring,
i
interpolate
the
statute,
to
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
i,
therefore,
deem
it
our
duty
as
appellees
to
present
to
your
honors
the
facts
of
the
record
bearing
on
the
settled
doctrine
of
this
court,
that
the
court
will
not
act
under
section
--
of
the
section
of
the
code
where
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
to
be
reviewed
lacks
the
requisite
finality
and
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
or
takes
jurisdiction
only
of
federal
questions
passed
on
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
being
reviewed.
i
will
spend
relatively
little
of
my
short
time
on
the
substance
dealing
and
passing
only
with
the
so-called
mckesson
&
robins
point
which
affects
upjohn
peculiarly.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i'd
be
glad
to
do
so.
it's
been
remanded
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
the
trial
court
for
trial
of
the
remaining
issues
which
were
issues
severed
on
may
2,
1960
in
the
trial
court.
i
intended
to
come
to
that
later
and,
on
which,
the
so-called
mckesson
&
robbins
point,
previously
reserved
by
stipulation,
will
be
tried
on
which
other
defenses
of
mr.
krotinger's
client
will
be
tried
and
any
defenses
he
adds
by
amendment,
our
right
to
an
injunction
and
damages
will
be
tried.
therefore,
we
say,
and
i'm
sketching
it
very
rapidly,
that
we
lack
finality
here,
not
that
we,
as
he
implies,
lack
of
confidence
in
the
merits,
mr.
willis
will
deal
with
them,
but
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
degree
of
finality
which
your
honors
have
sketched
in
the
republic
national
gas
case
and
others,
and
they're
all
in
our
brief,
is
not
here
at
all.
the
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
is
back
on
the
trial
court
on
the
severed
questions.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
that's
an
exact
statement
with
two
possible
additions
that,
in
mr.
krotinger's
favor,
i
should
add
to
be
entirely
candid.
there
is
a
possible
inferential
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
the
effect
that
the
so-called
notice
point
in
mr.
krotinger's
appeal
is
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution.
that's
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
ohio
statute
within
the
framework
of
the
congressional
exemptions
in
the
mcguire
act
and
the
miller-tydings
act.
he
says
that's
been
construed
in
our
favor
against
him
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
it's
not
to
be
found
in
the
language
but
that's
an
inferential
construction,
as
they
are
told.
nothing
else,
i
think,
comes
out
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
except
the
final
determination
as
to
the
ohio
constitution
and
its
impact
on
this
new
statute
of
1959.
your
honors
will
appreciate
how
that
is
so.
if
you
gather
from
mr.
krotinger's
history
that
in
ohio,
the
prior
nonsigner
statute
and
the
bargain
fair
case
so-called
of
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
declaring
the
prior
statute
unconstitutional
as
an
undue
delegation
of
legislative
power,
how
those
preempted
the
entire
foreground
of
the
--
of
the
litigation.
therefore,
it
became
important
to
the
parties,
as
i
gather
from
the
record,
and
i
was
not
in
the
ohio
litigation
but
i'm
confined
by
the
record
as
i
take
it
the
court
is,
as
i
gather,
it
was
important
to
the
parties
to
have
a
determination
of
the
ohio
constitutional
point.
now,
since
that
part
is
raised
by
the
question,
may
i
at
once
go
to
that
and
refer
your
honors
to
the
place
in
this
comprehensive
record
where
the
supreme
court
dealt
with
it.
it's
at
page
413,
and
i
skip
any
further
references
to
the
prior
decisions
below.
your
honors
will
find,
beginning
at
414,
the
long
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
starting
with
the
case
i
mentioned,
the
bargain
fair
case,
where
they
declared
that
the
prior
statute
in
ohio
was
unconstitutional.
it
goes
on
to
discuss
the
ohio
constitution.
he
goes
on
to
quote
on
page
416,
from
the
new
1959
statute,
the
definition
of
the
proprietor's
proprietary
interest
in
the
trademarked
commodity
which
is
to
be
fair
traded
and
then
he
goes
on,
on
page
417,
to
say
this
brings
us
to
a
consideration
of
the
second
--
of
the
new
concepts
incorporated
in
the
new
act.
he
quotes
the
definition
of
contract
in
the
new
act.
then,
he
says,
at
page
417,
"this
provision
is
the
core
of
the
act,
the
definition
of
contract.
"
now,
at
that
point,
mr.
krotinger
has
said
and
he's
appealed
the
legislative
history
somewhere
else,
that
is,
in
congress
of
another
bill
which
he
says
is
the
progenitor
of
this
ohio
statute.
mr.
krotinger
has
said
that
those
words
mean
a
consensual
contract.
"contract
means
any
agreement,
written
or
verbal
or
arising
from
the
acts
of
the
parties,"
says
the
ohio
statute
and
mr.
krotinger
says
that
the
--
the
permissive
federal
legislation
contract
or
agreement
is
limited
to
something
consensual.
the
ohio
court
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
that
with
respect
to
the
federal
problem,
although
it
has
construed
the
ohio
statute.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir?
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
raised.
you
will
find
no
discussion
of
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court,
where
mr.
krotinger
says
and
has
filed
the
briefs
that
it
was
also
raised,
you
would
find
the
only
reference
on
page
424,
your
honor,
after
discussing
the
ohio
constitutional
attack
on
the
ohio
statute,
in
the
third
line
of
424,
the
presiding
--
the
prevailing
group
and
the
court
says,
"none
of
the
constitutional
attacks
on
this
new
act
have
merit."
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
assume
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
could
say.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
--
you
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
he
could,
your
honor,
on
two
grounds.
i
think
this
court
ought
to
hear
the
ohio
supreme
court's
ruling
on
the
federal
statutory
point
and
above
all,
in
relation
to
that,
this
--
this
court,
i
think,
would
consider
itself
bound
by
what
the
ohio
court
said
its
statute
meant.
now,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
on
this
record,
in
the
--
both
cases,
i
think,
certainly
in
my
case,
there
are
written
contracts.
the
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
that
upjohn
entered
into
written
fair
trade
price
maintenance
contract
as
permitted
by
the
statute
with
numerous
pharmacists.
it
has
70,000
retail
outlets.
this
appellant
did
not
sign
a
contract
but
he
admits
that
he
had
notice,
and
the
notice
is
in
the
record
at
page
4,
of
the
existence
of
the
contracts
and
of
the
price
maintenance
requirement.
now,
what
is
the
effect
of
those
facts
on
the
construction
of
the
ohio
statute?
i
think
your
honors
would
want
to
hear
from
the
ohio
supreme
court
as
to
what
they
thought,
in
regard
to
mr.
krotinger's
contention,
applied
to
the
ohio
statute
because
they
will
construe
that
statute.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
would,
sir.
i
think
i
would.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honors,
that
--
that
case,
we
want
to
send
it
back.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
believe
that
refers
to
the
statement
on
the
preceding
page,
423,
which
begins
with
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“two
other
matters
are
urged
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
legislation,”
and
he
goes
on
“first,
delegation
of
power
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
second
is
final
contention
is
sale
of
his
own
property.”
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
--
you
certify
questions
and
you
brief
them
both.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
--
yes,
i
believe
they
were,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
also,
and
i
have
not
had
the
time
and
opportunity
since
receiving
the
reply
brief
to
check
the
ohio
practice
but
i
am
told
the
ohio
rules
quoted
by
my
adversary,
with
dots
or
asterisks
at
that
point,
leave
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
ohio
court
whether
to
rule
on
these
points
that
have
been
raised.
now
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
or
because
that
might
be
so.
i
can't
conceive
what
would
move
their
discretion.
they
may
have
something
to
tribute.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
they
where
in
the
briefs.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
they
were
in
the
briefs.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i've
read,
your
honor,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
as
to
the
certification
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
limited
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
the
rehearing
petition
did
--
did
mention.
now
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
394?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
discusses
the
mcguire
act.
this
is
a
part
of
legislative
history.
i
don't
know
whether
it
purports
to
rule
on
mr.
krotinger's
contention.
i
do
want
to
make,
since
i'm
confusing
my
argument
to
answer
the
court's
questions,
i
do
want
to
make
a
clear
exception
to
what
i've
been
saying.
what
mr.
krotinger
calls
to
the
mckesson
&
robbins
point
that
is
the
contention
that
we
sold
to
wholesalers,
with
whom
we
were
in
competition
at
the
resale
level,
was
expressly
carved
out
of
the
case
by
a
stipulation
which
i
can
best
state
to
the
court
by
reading
it
from
mr.
krotinger's
brief
at
page
23
of
the
appellants
brief
and
this
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
10?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i'll
refer
to
page
10
of
our
brief
which
gives
the
substance
of
the
stipulation
as
quoted
by
him
from
the
jurisdictional
statement.
“both
upjohn
and
lilly
filed
answers
and
so
on
in
order
to
narrow
and
thereby,
to
expedite
the
determination
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
the
parties
agreed
the
cases
should
be
heard
by
the
court
of
common
pleas
on
the
issues
raised
by
plaintiff-appellants'
petitions
for
declaratory
judgments
and
defendant-appellees
entered
thereto.
the
litigation
was,
therefore,
narrowed
to
the
basic
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
fair
trade
law.
"
and
we
say
that
means
the
ohio
constitutionality.
"the
parties
reserved
for
future
determination,"
and
thus
relates
to
the
mckesson
&
robbins
point,
the
parties
reserved
for
future
determination.
the
issue
is
raised
by
defendant-appellees'
cross-petitions
and
plaintiff-appellants
replies.
now,
the
essential
thing,
your
honors,
in
the
chronology
here
is
that
this
mckesson
&
robbins
point
came
later
in
the
litigation
and
was,
therefore,
carved
out
in
the
reserved
and
to
refer
to
the
chronology,
your
honors
might
want
to
look
at
the
record.
i
refer
to
the
docket
entries
at
page
--
at
record,
page
367
and
--
to
370.
now,
these
show
that,
as
shown
at
page
--
the
docket
entries
are
into
367
to
370
and
the
amended
answer
of
hudson
in
which
it,
for
the
first
time,
raised
what
i
call
the
mckesson
&
robbins
issue,
was
filed
april
25,
1960,
as
shown
at
page
368
of
the
docket
and
the
substance
containing
the
mckesson
&
robbins
defense
is
at
pages
27
and
29
or
rather
29
of
this
record,
so
that
when
we
talk
about
what
went
to
the
ohio
appellate
courts,
we
must
carve
that
out.
and
when
you
come
to
analyze
out
what
went
to
those
courts,
i
think
you
will
find
that
they
survived
only
for
determination
inferentially
this
so-called
notice
point
in
the
analysis
of
the
mcguire
act.
now,
your
honors
might
want
to
look
in
that
connection,
page
23
of
mr.
krotinger's
brief
and
i
apologize
for
the
confusion
of
the
record,
but
that's
what
we
have
brought
here.
page
23,
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
did
not
discuss
the
permissible
scope
of
either
state
fair
trade
legislation
or
fair
trade
contract
under
the
federal
enabling
legislation.
at
page
27,
the
controlling
of
the
minority
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
never
adverted
to
any
issues
concerning
federal
state
relationships
in
price
fixing
by
private
persons
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
i
believe
that
they
were
adverted
to
in
a
vague
way
in
appellant's
briefs,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
but
not
the
mckesson
&
robbins
point
that
i've
just
mentioned
as
an
exception.
excuse
me,
justice
clark?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
because
they
don't
have
enough
votes,
so
this
refers
to
a
limitation
in
the
ohio
constitution
that
--
which
has
been
accepted
by
a
ruling
in
this
court
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
it
requires
six
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
to
declare.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
it
could
well
be,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
perhaps,
just
to
explain
how
the
4-to-3
vote
operates
for
the
purposes
of
the
public
reading
of
this
decision.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
no,
sir.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
constitution
but
it
--
it
might
well
be,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
an
ohio
constitution.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
supreme
court
didn't
think
so
and
didn't
say
so.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
supreme
court
denied
the
appeal
in
which
mr.
krotinger
says
this
point
was
raised
and
all
i
say,
your
honor,
is
the
supreme
court
did
not
discuss
the
points
that
the
court's
questions
have
been
raising.
and
i
refer
to
the
matter
of
certificate
from
the
court
would
--
which
this
court
frequently,
at
requests,
as
to
what
was
actually
decided
below
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
only
the
jurisdictional
statement
which
is
excessively
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
because
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
if
it's
raised?
i
believe
this
court,
according
to
its
practice,
has
required
an
expression
of
the
--
of
the
opinion
of
the
highest
court
on
all
questions
raised
before
it
will
review
them.
certainly,
i
would
say
that
was
so
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
ohio
statute.
now,
i'm
less
positive
as
to
federal
constitutional
questions.
but
i
do
make
it
clear,
your
honor,
again,
i
trust
that
the
so-called
mckesson
&
robbins
question,
the
competition
with
the
wholesaler
at
the
retail
level
was
reserved
like
other
matters
in
the
case
by
express
stipulation
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
for
trial
in
the
cases
remanded.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
never
raised
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
now
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
notice
was.
now,
i'm
sorry
this
is
so
laborious,
your
honors,
but
mr.
krotinger
has
favored
us
all
by
filing
with
the
court
copies
of
all
the
briefs
below
and
he
has
said
that
we
accepted
or
implied
that
we
accepted
the
argument
that
he
made
that
the
mckesson
&
robbins
case
was
up
on
appeal.
now,
i
have
here
the
--
two
of
the
briefs
of
the
appellee,
upjohn.
one
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
at
page
28,
where
we
say
the
mckesson
&
robbins
argument
is
completely
out
of
place
and
irrelevant
to
the
case
at
bar,
so
we
ask
the
court
not
to
discuss
it.
the
same
--
the
same
argument
is
a
statement
that's
made
by
us
in
the
briefs
in
the
supreme
court
and
in
the
trial
court.
now
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
because
mr.
krotinger
urged
it.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
he
did
raise
it,
yes.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
exactly.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
and
we
call
attention,
again,
the
fact,
as
admitted
by
his
own
briefs,
that
there
was
a
stipulation
taking
out
and
reserving
for
future
trial
this
issue
with
others,
pleading
damages
and
injunction
on
the
remand
which
the
courts
have
now
ordered.
now,
i
had
hoped
to
leave
the
court
in
a
more
orderly
way
through
what
i
apologize
for
as
a
very
confused
record
but
i
trust,
i've
said
enough
with
the
references
in
the
brief
to
show
that
there
is
--
here,
no
finality
of
the
kind
requisite
for
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
and
that
almost
none
of
the
constitutional
questions
asserted
here,
except
perhaps
one,
the
no
–
so
called
notice
question
has
been
passed
on
even
inferentially
by
the
ohio
court.
now,
mr.
krotinger
said
orally
that
there
was
something
about
a
del
credere
agency
in
this
case
and
he
claimed
that
there
--
thus,
involved,
i
think
he
said,
horizontal
price
fixing.
the
del
credere
agency,
which
existed
in
a
very
few
cases,
in
the
case
of
upjohn,
contained
no
provisions
which
authorized
the
distributor
or
required
it
to
make
a
similar
agreement
with
other
distributors.
section
6
of
the
del
credere
agency
agreement,
which
is
in
this
record,
excuse
me,
section
6,
which
is
at
page
107
specifically
says,
“the
agent
shall
not
control
or
attempt
to
control
prices.
”
the
difficulty
one
has
in
presenting
this
cause
in
a
partial
record
is
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
i'm
informed,
but
is
not
in
the
record,
that
the
del
credere
agencies
have
all
been
terminated
as
of
the
date
after
the
first
proceedings
below,
that
is,
as
of
december
1961
but
you
won't
find
that
in
this
record
because
this
point,
with
other
points,
is
going
back
on
the
remand
from
the
supreme
court.
now,
may
i
then
pass
to
the
allegation,
which
is
also
in
mr.
krotinger's
brief,
that
due
process
of
law,
federal
due
process
of
law
--
could
i
have
their
--
their
reply
brief?
federal
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
--
federal
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
yes,
sir?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
the
purpose
of
the
remand
was
for
trial
on
the
remaining
issues
including
the
reserved,
the
severed
cross-petition
of
the
defendant,
upjohn
and
the
amended
reply
of
hudson
thereto,
also
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages.
the
case
is
still
on
trial.
nothing
has
been
done,
as
stated
in
our
brief,
pending
the
hearing
by
this
court
but
it's
now
in
the
lower
courts
of
ohio.
do
i
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
you
asked
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
remand?
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
--
my
--
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
my
submission
had
been
that
this
is
not
ripe
for
decision
here.
my
submission
had
been
that
we
are
now
in
the
middle
of
an
ohio
litigation
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
had
been
decided
and
the
remaining
issues,
including
any
new
ones
that
mr.
krotinger
asserts,
are
to
go
back
to
trial.
mr.
ralph
m.
carson
well,
i
--
i
must
admit
that
the
record
is
not
clear
and
the
allegations
concerning
the
record
are
not
clear.
now,
as
to
remand,
may
i
refer
your
honor
--
your
honors
to
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
did
remand
the
cause
at
page
--
at
page
412.
it
remanded
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
the
cuyahoga
county
to
carry
this
judgment
into
effect
and
for
execution
and
for
further
proceedings.
at
the
end
of
the
court
of
--
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
you'll
find
simply
an
affirmance.
now,
as
to
the
due
process
point,
i'm
going
to
find
their
brief,
as
to
the
possibility
of
federal
due
process
having
been
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court,
i
find
that
in
their
reply
brief
--
in
their
brief
in
the
supreme
court
at
page
30,
they
say
only
state
of
ohio
due
process
is
involved
and
they
discuss
only
that
form
of
due
process.
and
the
reason
they
do
show,
they're
showing
it
elsewhere
in
their
briefs
because
in
ohio,
they
were
confronted
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
old
dearborn
case
that
upheld
the
enforcement
of
a
state
non
--
nonsigner
law.
therefore,
they
discussed,
in
ohio,
only
state
due
process.
going
to
the
notice
point,
which
approaches
the
substance
and
which
i
feel
will
be
further
developed
by
mr.
--
mr.
willis.
i
merely
mentioned
that
we
have
in
this
case,
as
i've
said
before,
series
of
express
contracts
by
the
appellee,
upjohn,
which
as
to
the
appellant
is
conveyed
to
him
by
notice.
now,
the
court
in
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
says
that
this
is
a
valid
application
or
protection
of
trademarked
property,
which
is
all
that's
involved
here,
where
the
producers
are
in
competition
as
they
are
here.
and
it
construes
the
ohio
statute,
we
say,
authoritatively
in
that
regard.
we're
not
confined
to
notice.
we
have
the
concept
of
implied
contract
discussed
in
the
supreme
court
and
as
to
mr.
krotinger's
suggestion
that
this
is
a
mere
fecal
mask,
i
happened
to
have
taken
with
me
jenks'
old
history
of
english
law
from
which
it's
clear
that
implied
contract
is
one
of
the
oldest
hits
of
the
common
law
jurisdiction
in
anglo-american
law.
i
think
that
we
should
say,
therefore,
that
on
the
implied
contract
construction
which
this
ohio
legislature
and
supreme
court
have
(inaudible),
we
are
here
as
regard
to
the
mcguire
act
with
full
authority
of
congress
which
enacted
that
act
to
deal
with
this
special
situation.
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
hasty
manner
which
i've
been
obliged
to
present
a
complicated
record.
