mr.
paul
burks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel
for
respondent.
this
case
is
here
for
a
review
of
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
held
that
support
allowance
payments
to
a
decedent's
widow
did
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
under
the
estate
tax
laws.
the
revenue
act
of
1916
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
modern
estate
tax
law
contained
a
provision
allowing
a
deduction
and
computing
the
net
estate
for
amounts
paid
to
those
dependants
upon
the
decedent
during
the
administration
of
the
estate.
the
wording
was
slightly
changed
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918,
but
it
thereafter
remained
the
same
until
that
deduction
ceased
to
be
allowed
as
a
standard
deduction
by
the
revenue
act
of
1950.
it
appeared
in
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
as
section
812
(b)
(5)
and
it
provided
as
i
recall
it
that
should
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
for
amounts
reasonably
required
and
actually
expended
for
the
support
during
the
administration
of
the
estate
of
those
dependant
upon
the
decedent.
the
revenue
act
of
1948
by
section
811
(e)
introduced
the
marital
deduction
concept
into
the
federal
estate
tax
law.
the
1948
revenue
act
did
not
repeal
section
812
(b)
and
from
then
until
1950,
that
deduction
for
support
payments
continued
to
be
allowed
in
addition
to
the
marital
deduction.
during
that
two
year
period,
it
was
possible
to
channel
more
than
half
of
a
decedent's
estate
to
his
or
her
surviving
spouse
without
payment
of
the
estate
tax
because
the
support
payments
under
section
812
(b)
were
100%
deductible
and
the
marital
deduction
was
limited
to
50%
of
the
decedent's
adjusted
gross
estate.
now,
section
812
(b)
payments
--
812
(b)
(5)
payments
were
deducted
in
computing
the
adjusted
gross
estate,
but
because
section
812
(b)
(5)
payments
were
100%
deductible
and
the
marital
deduction
was
limited
to
50%
of
the
adjusted
gross
estate,
it
was
nevertheless
possible
to
channel
more
than
half
the
decedent's
property
to
his/her
surviving
spouse
free
of
estate
tax
and
in
many
estates
that
made
the
difference
between
the
payment
of
estate
tax
and
no
payment
of
estate
tax.
congress
acted
quickly
and
in
1950,
812
(b)
(5)
was
eliminated
as
a
standard
deduction,
but
at
that
time,
congress
said,
amounts
heretofore
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provision
will
nevertheless
be
allowed
–
congress
said
that
amounts
previously
we
allowed
under
812
(b)
(5)
would
be
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limitations
of
that
section.
now
the
purpose
of
the
marital
deduction
of
course
was
to
equalize
the
state
tax
treatment
between
residents
of
common
law
and
community
property
estates
and
the
substantive
conditions
and
limitations
of
the
marital
deduction
provisions
were
the
condition
that
the
property
be
included
in
the
decedent's
taxable
estate,
the
condition
that
it
go
to
the
surviving
spouse
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
taxed
in
the
estate
of
the
surviving
spouse
if
not
consumed
and
the
limitation
that
the
total
amount
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provision
not
exceed
50%
of
the
decedent's
adjusted
gross
estate.
mr.
paul
burks
i
haven't
come
to
that
sir.
mr.
paul
burks
that
is
one
of
the
provisions
of
section
812
(b),
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
i
did
say
something
related
to
that.
i
said
that
the
property
had
to
go
to
the
surviving
spouse
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
taxed
in
the
surviving
spouse's
estate
and
i
believe
that,
that
was
the
reason
for
the
terminable
interest
rule.
section
812
(b)
(1)
(2)
i
believe
it
is,
is
entitled
life
estates
or
other
terminable
interests
and
that
i
believe
was
designed
to
prevent
an
interest
such
as
a
life
estate
from
qualifying
for
the
marital
deduction
because
it
then
would
not
be
taxed
in
the
estate
of
the
surviving
spouse.
mr.
paul
burks
no
sir.
mr.
paul
burks
it's
taxable
in
the
decedent's
estate.
mr.
paul
burks
yeah,
that's
right.
but,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
surviving
spouse
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
taxed
in
the
estate
of
the
surviving
spouse.
mr.
paul
burks
right,
i
think
that
applies
to
dower
interest
and
other
interest
of
that
type.
now,
if
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
courts
had
given
substantial
effect
or
really
any
effect
to
what
congress
said
in
1950
when
812
(b)
(5)
was
eliminated
as
a
standard
deduction,
the
equality
of
tax
treatment
as
between
taxpayers
and
separate
property
and
community
property
estates
would
have
been
more
nearly
achieved
but
as
it
turned
out
very
few
support
payments
have
been
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provision.
the
first
argument
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
was
that
they
weren't
passing
interest
within
the
meaning
of
section
812
(b),
but
it
is
well
settled
at
this
time
both
by
court
decision
and
by
the
regulations
of
the
commissioner
that
support
payments
are
considered
to
be
passing
interest
within
the
federal
estate
tax
law.
the
objection
that
is
raised
now
to
the
allowance
of
support
payments
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions
is
that
they
are
terminable
and
that
concept
finds
its
greatest
expression
i
believe
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
a
decision
entitled
estate
of
cuna.
now
the
basis
of
that
decision
is
that
because
it
can't
be
known
at
the
instant
of
the
decedent's
death
whether
or
not
the
surviving
spouse
will
get
any
family
allowance
that
it's
a
terminable
interest,
they
say
that
the
property
are
the
assets
of
the
estate
and
not
the
payment.
and
for
that
reason
they
disallowed
in
the
estate
of
cuna
periodic
support
payments
as
a
deduction
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions.
mr.
paul
burks
that's
true
mr.
justice
stewart
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
paul
burks
that's
a
statutory
right,
the
statutory
right.
mr.
paul
burks
that's
right,
and
normally
the
discretion
of
the
probate
judge
under
section
812
(b)
(5)
determined
what
was
reasonably
required
and
actually
expanded,
if
the
surviving
spouse
died,
the
payments
might
stop
and
then
the
deduction
would
be
limited
to
what
was
actually
paid.
now
the
courts
retreated
somewhat
from
that
rule
in
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuits
in
particular,
and
through
decisions
united
states
against
first
national
bank
of
augusta,
and
in
the
e.
o.
bookwalter
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
they
have
held
that
lump
sum
support
allowance
payments
will
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
because
the
award
when
made
best
indefeasibly
in
widow
or
her
estate,
and
should
therefore
be
allowed.
now
in
the
opinion
of
petitioner
that
rule
does
not
go
far
enough,
but
at
least
most
of
the
courts
in
the
country
at
this
time
including
the
tax
court
and
through
decisions
in
which
the
commissioner
has
acquiesced,
recognized
the
lump
sum
support
payments
will
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
if
they
vested
indefeasibly
in
the
surviving
spouse
on
the
date
of
the
order.
now
one
ground
petitioner's
–
excuse
me
petition
to
this
court
is
that
we
have
the
lump
sum
allowance.
the
decedent
g.
a.
richards
died
in
california
on
may
27,
1951.
on
june
30,
1952
more
than
13
months
after
the
date
of
the
decedent's
death,
the
california
court
ordered
an
allowance
of
$3000
a
month
payable
to
mrs.
richards,
and
at
the
time
of
the
order,
on
the
day
the
order
was
made,
the
order
was
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
decedent's
death,
and
on
the
day
the
order
was
made
$42,000
indefeasibly
vested
in
mrs.
richards
and
belonged
to
her
or
her
estate
regardless
of
whether
she
remarried
or
died
after
that
order
was
made.
mr.
paul
burks
she
was
actually
paid
the
money
shortly
thereafter,
but
if
she
hadn't
received
it,
her
executive
could
have
collected
it
from
the
estate
and
we
say
that
is
a
lump
sum
allowance
because
on
the
date
of
the
order
she
or
her
successors
in
interest
had
a
fixed
vested
right
in
the
$42,000.
mr.
paul
burks
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
burks
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
burks
yes,
in
re
lukach
is
the
decision
which
so
holds
--
mr.
paul
burks
no.
mr.
paul
burks
i
don't
believe
so,
but
petitioners
would
like
to
go
further
than
that.
we
would
like
to
think
the
congress
when
it
said
in
1950
should
support
allowance
would
be
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provision
that
is
exactly
what
it
said
an
812
(b)
prior
payments
or
payments
normally
made
soon
to
order
of
the
local
court
during
the
course
of
the
administration
of
the
decedent's
estate.
now
this
is
a
national
law.
in
the
opinion
of
petitioner
should
be
given
uniform
application,
and
the
rights
of
taxpayers
in
common
law
estates,
because
this
no
longer
applies
to
community
property,
but
the
rights
of
taxpayers
and
common
law
estates
should
not
be
made
to
depend
on
little
subtle
differences
in
local
law,
if
a
surviving
spouse
receives
payments
for
her
support,
in
cash,
as
is
the
case
here,
that
is
the
full
interest
in
the
property,
it
is
not
a
life
estate.
it
is
indeterminable
interest,
it's
something
that's
the
full
interest
and
it
should
be
allowed
in
the
opinion
of
petitioners
subject
to
the
50%
of
adjusted
gross
estate
limitation
and
subject
to
courts
it's
having
been
paid
out
a
property
which
is
included
in
the
decedent's
gross
estate
subject
to
tax.
mr.
paul
burks
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
critical.
it's
the
basis
upon
which
all
of
the
courts
have
disagreed.
and
i
think
in
any
estate,
you
have
to
look
at
what
a
decedent
owns
and
what
he
owes
as
of
the
date
of
his
death.
if
a
man
leaves
his
widow
1/3rd
of
his
net
distributable
estate,
it
isn't
known
when
he
dies
whether
she
is
going
to
get
anything.
the
claims
of
creditors
and
other
things
that
might
happen
and
the
estate
might
entirely
destroy,
her
right
to
that
one
third
of
the
distributable
net
estate,
but
when
the
marital
deduction
is
computed,
that
one
third
concept
is
related
back
to
the
date
of
death
and
some
courts
have
been
honest
enough
to
say,
that's
what
they
are
doing
when
they
allow
lump
sum
awards
for
example.
now
the
fifth
circuit
in
united
states
national
bank,
the
bank
of
augusta
case,
us
against
the
first
national
bank
of
augusta,
said
they
would
look
at
the
date
of
the
order,
but
in
determining
the
whole
concept
of
this
payment,
they
necessarily
had
to
look
at
the
date
of
death
to
determine
the
gross
estate,
and
to
do
other
things
in
that
estate.
and
the
sixth
circuit,
in
dourdy,
cited
with
approval
in
respondent's
brief,
the
widow
had
a
dower
right.
she
renounced
under
her
husband's
will
and
said
i
want
to
take
under
the
intestacy
laws,
she
had
a
dower
right,
which
was
a
terminable
interest.
over
13
months
after
the
decedent's
death,
she
elected
to
convert
that
dower
right
into
cash
under
kentucky
law.
the
courts
said
they
would
relate
that
elected
back
to
the
date
of
death
and
that
i
think
what
it
should
be
done
in
all
support
payments.
in
the
fifth
circuit
case,
united
states
against
the
first
national
bank
of
augusta,
the
award
was
not
of
cash,
it
was
59,000
in
bonds,
negotiable
securities.
the
court
there
held
that
the
date
of
the
order
was
controlling,
but
they
had
to
go
back
to
the
date
of
death
for
some
purposes
and
whether
that
widow
had
petitioned
twice
instead
of
once
and
she
had
gotten
$30,000
worth
of
bonds
on
two
separate
occasions,
but
what
if
she
had
petitioned
15
times,
and
gotten
$4000
worth
of
bonds
on
each
occasion,
it
would
be
the
date
of
the
order
and
when
you
have
one
order
that
gives
monthly
right
fruition
as
each
month
goes
by,
shouldn't
that
be
treated
the
same
as
though
it
were
a
over
lump
sum
award.
when
the
right
rests,
it
all
relates
back
to
the
date
of
death,
the
lump
sum
award
cases
necessarily
have
to
relate
the
payment
back
to
the
date
of
death,
but
that
relation
back
shouldn't
be
limited
to
lump
sum
awards.
it's
paid
out
of
the
estate.
if
it's
paid
in
such
form,
if
it's
paid
in
life
estate,
i
don't
think
it
should
qualify.
mr.
paul
burks
that
is
true,
but
the
action
of
the
widow
on
the
sixth
circuit,
the
action
of
the
widow
on
the
fifth
circuit
and
then
the
eighth
circuit,
all
could
have
terminated
the
allowance
or
prevented
if
from
coming
into
being
and
under
the
old
section
812
(b)
concept
–
(b)
(5)
concept,
which
was
in
the
estate
tax
law
for
34
years,
it
was
the
payment,
that
was
the
thing
that
was
important
and
petitioners
feel
that
that
same
rule
should
be
applied
here.
it
doesn't
result
in
any
avoidance
of
tax.
it
is
still
limited
by
the
50%
adjusted
gross
estate
concept,
and
it's
paid
full
interest.
if
it
was
paid
in
cash
or
in
bonds,
it
goes
to
the
surviving
spouse,
thank
you.
mr.
paul
burks
the
court
mentioned,
the
counsel
correspondent
mentioned
the
six
months
provision.
that
is
a
statutory
provision
in
section
812
(e)
(1)
(d).
it
applies
only
to
wills.
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
inherited
right.
if
a
man
dies
without
a
will,
the
six
months
provision
has
no
application
whatsoever
and
the
statutory
right
to
a
widow's
allowance
is
much
more
is
certain
than
any
interest
on
an
estate
which
a
widow
might
take
because
it's
given
preference
to
the
claims
of
certain
creditors
and
that's
a
more
profitable
interest
than
an
inter-state
rightist.
now
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
can
do
anything
about
it,
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
report
of
the
senate
finance
committee
in
1954
“your
committee
rejected
a
special
provision
added
by
the
house
that
allowed
widows'
allowances
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
to
the
extent
paid
within
one
year
of
the
decedent's
death”.
under
the
present
law,
many
widows'
allowances
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
during
deduction
without
regard
to
the
time
of
payment.
it
is
believed
without
regard
to
the
time
of
payment.
it
is
believed
that
the
house
bill
might
raise
some
questions
as
to
the
treatment
under
the
marital
deduction
of
these
widows'
allowances
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
received
within
one
year
of
the
decedent's
death
and
that
is
the
question
that's
here
today
and
here
so
far
as
i
know
for
the
first
time.
the
court
asked
how
many
cases
that
allowed
lump
sum
payments.
they
include
united
states
against
first
national
bank
of
augusta,
candler,
landers,
gale,
rudnick,
patty,
reynolds,
rensenhouse,
phelps
against
bookwalter,
gardner's
estate,
avery,
ken
against
wisener
and
many
others.
unless
there
is
an
isolated
transaction,
the
lump
sum
awards
have
been
allowed
by
many
courts
and
the
commissioner
is
acquiesced
in
some
of
those
cases.
and
more
circuit
courts
have
decided
cases
of
that
nature
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers
and
against
them,
and
in
the
respondent's
brief
it
said,
“a
marital
deduction
is
allowed
for
the
value
of
property
received
under
state
law
where
the
widow
elects
to
take
against
decedent's
will,”
now
that's
a
fairly
a
statutory
right,
“where
under
a
state
law
a
widow
obtains
a
fixed
right
to
claim
a
non-terminable
interest
at
her
husband's
death
the
mere
procedural
requirement
of
the
widow
signified
her
election
or
filed
her
claim
which
she
might
do
immediately,
does
not
make
the
interest
meaningfully
contingent.
her
election
to
take
the
interest
is
therefore
deemed
or
relate
back
to
the
date
of
the
decedent's
death
and
the
marital
deduction
is
permitted
with
respect
to
the
property
actually
passing
and
vesting”
and
that's
what
petitioners
would
like
this
court
to
do.
mr.
paul
burks
the
connecticut
rule
your
honor
was
passed
in
1961,
and
i
submit
that
after
reading
second
national
bank
of
new
haven
against
the
united
states,
which
appears
in
222
federal
supplement
at
page
446,
the
court
will
come
to
no
conclusion
except
that
the
connecticut
law
was
designed
solely
to
take
advantage
of
this
lump
sum
payment
doctrine.
mr.
paul
burks
yes,
your
honor,
but
then
i
think
it
stops
to
be
a
family
allowance
payment,
the
need
becomes
more
of
a
body
for
being
married
rather
than
a
support
payment,
because
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
whether
it
goes
to
the
widow
or
her
estate
under
connecticut
law.
mr.
paul
burks
i
am
arguing
for
both
your
honor,
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
they
should
both
be
allowed
under
the
marital
deduction
provisions.
that
was
the
intent
of
congress,
under
existing
law
amounts
–-
mr.
paul
burks
well,
i
think
the
time
of
payment
as
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
time
of
payment
should
relate
back
to
the
date
of
death,
but
once
paid
in
cash,
there
is
no
terminable
interest.
there
is
no
other
interest
in
cash.
it's
property
that
belongs
permanently
to
the
widow,
more
permanently
than
an
interstate
right
to
a
part
of
the
estate.
mr.
paul
burks
they
have
your
honor,
but
i
have
also
mentioned
these
cases
on
page
15
in
the
respondent's
brief
which
elect
to
statute,
a
statutory
right
and
a
statutory
right
in
all
reality
has
much
greater
value
to
a
widow,
because
it's
referred
to
other
claims
than
an
interstate
right,
and
it's
for
the
property
passing
to
another.
if
the
property
is
the
payment
and
she
has
it
in
her
hand,
it
isn't
going
to
pass
to
anyone
else.
mr.
paul
burks
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
subject
to
the
condition
and
limitations
of
section
812
(e),
and
the
condition
and
limitation
that
is
mentioned
by
counsel
for
respondent
is
section
812
(e)
(1)
(b)
which
is
entitled
life
estates
and
other
terminable
interests,
and
i
say
that
it
isn't
the
terminable
interest.
it
doesn't
come
within
that
rule,
if
the
property
is
regarded
as
being
the
payment
itself
as
in
reality,
it
has
to
be
or
no
widow's
allowances
are
going
to
be
allowed
except
perhaps
under
a
statute
such
as
that
of
connecticut,
which
really
isn't
the
widow's
allowance.
mr.
paul
burks
certainly
or
if
it
would
paid
in
the
life
estate,
i
would
say
it
didn't
qualify
because
it
wouldn't,
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
surviving
spouse
then
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
taxed
in
the
estate
of
the
surviving
spouse.
mr.
paul
burks
conceivably
it
could
be
payment
from
an
annuity
for
life.
it
is
the
way
it
was
paid
in
bonds
in
the
first
national
bank
of
augusta
case.
mr.
paul
burks
i
would
say
here
in
effect
the
court
said,
on
the
date
of
the
order,
you're
entitled
of
$42,000
plus
$3000
a
month
for
10
months.
mr.
paul
burks
yes
sir,
$30,000.
mr.
paul
burks
i
don't
think
i
would
because
–-
mr.
paul
burks
i
think
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
of
section
812
(b)
(5),
which
says
amounts
reasonably
required
and
actually
expended
for
the
support
of
the
decedent
during
the
administration
of
the
estate.
and
the
senate
finance
committee
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
that
was
the
type
of
payment
that
had
been
made
under
section
812
(b)
(5),
and
which
was
to
be
continued
under
the
marital
deduction
provision,
but
an
812
(b)
(5)
payment
would
not
have
been
an
award.
it
normally
would
not
have
been
an
award
other
than
cash
payments.
mr.
paul
burks
i
would,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
support
payments
should
be
for
amounts
reasonably
required
and
actually
expended
during
the
administration
of
the
estate.
i
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
i
think
that
the
taxpayers
and
common
law
estates
have
been
treated
badly
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
by
the
decisions
which
held
that
the
property
is
the
entire
estate.
it
isn't.
the
property
is
what
the
widow
gets
in
her
hand.
thank
you.
