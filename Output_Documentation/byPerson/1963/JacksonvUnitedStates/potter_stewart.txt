and
that
it
not
be
a
terminable
interest
or
have
you
already
mentioned
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
one
of
the
provisions.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
i
follow.
a
life
estate
to
a
surviving
spouse
is
not
qualified
as
a
marital
deduction?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
taxable
i
heard.
justice
potter
stewart
in
decedent's
estate.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
these
support
payments
as
a
matter
of
state
law
are
typically
not
provided
for
by
the
will,
but
rather
are
ordered
by
the
probate
court.
is
that
right?
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
certainly
true
in
this
case
and
i
suppose
it's
typically
true,
isn't
it?
it's
nothing
that
you're
providing
a
will
but
it's
something
that's
allowed
as
a
matter
of
the
state
law
in
the
–-
justice
potter
stewart
the
amount
depending
upon
the
discretion
of
the
probate
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
she
actually
get
the
money?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
clear
as
a
matter
of
california
law
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
order,
she
or
if
she
died,
her
executor
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
argument
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
account
for?
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
those
years,
there
was
deduction
for
it
for
a
widow?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
to
repealed
only
after
a
marital
deduction
was
provided
and
only
after
two
years
of
experience
showed
that
you
could,
with
the
combination
of
the
two,
you
could
get
more
than
half
of
the
adjusted
gross
estate,
exempt
from
state
tax
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
how
long
a
period
was
the
property
previously
tax
provisioned
in
the
estate
tax
law,
it
was
six
years
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
predecessor
to
the
marital
deduction
provision.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that,
those
durations
weren't
defined
to
spouse,
the
spouse
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
involved
a
chronological
limitation
within

justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
really
asking
for
information.
justice
potter
stewart
or
she
was
un-remarried
and
alive
at
the
time
of
the
order.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
tell
us
how
do
you
reconcile
the
commissioner's
acquiescence
in
the
lump
sum.
justice
potter
stewart
so
now
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing,
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you.
if
this
order
had
come
within
six
months,
would
that
have
made
any
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
there's
a
big
difference
in
a
community
property
estates.
you
do
get
the
whole
half.
justice
potter
stewart
here
there's
no
quarrel
about
the
limitation
being
–-
percent
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
holy
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
lump-sum
cases
have
there
been
decided
against
you,
against
your
present
position?
several,
more
than
one?
justice
potter
stewart
and
tax
court
decisions,
three,
four,
five,
and
the
commissioner
has
acquiesced
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
he
first
acquiesce?
justice
potter
stewart
but
she
dies
the
next
day--
justice
potter
stewart
although,
the
amount
would
not
be
ascertainable.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
minima
and
maxima
but
the
amount
wouldn't
be
ascertainable
–-
justice
potter
stewart
well,
half
but
net
taxable
estate
involves
after
you
count
up
the
creditor's
claims
and
the
expenses
of
administration
and
rest
of
it,
and
then
it's
just
a
matter
of
mathematics
but
the
amount
of
a
widow's
allowance
depends
upon
the
discretion
of
a
third-party
i.e.
the
probate
judge.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
the
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
1950?
don't
you
think
they
eliminated
the
longstanding
deduction
and
they
put
it
over
as
part
of
the
marital
deduction,
didn't
they?
and
-–
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
limitations
of
section
812
(e).
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
page
16
of
the
petitioner's
brief
-–
there's
an
excerpt
from
the
finance
committee's
report.
justice
potter
stewart
the
obvious
limitations
--
i
mean
the
most
--
the
way
that
everybody
knows
about
it
as
they
have
one
half
limitation
and
that's
clearly
nobody
is
scrolling
about
but
whether
or
not
something
was
terminable
is
–-
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
how
many
states
would
the
rule
be
such
as
the
one
you
described
in
connecticut?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
contrast
you
say
that
i
guess,
it's
agreed
that
the
law
of
california
is
clear
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
a
widow's
allowance,
you
(a)
have
to
be
living
at
the
time
it's
allowed
and/or
paid
and
(b)
be
unmarried
at
that
time.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
on
the
other
hand
don't
disagree
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
order
in
this
case
since
she
was
alive
and
was
unmarried
she
was
then
--
had
a
vested
right
to
recover
$42,000
to
$42,000
which
would
have
vested
in
her
executives,
do
you
also
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
the
order.
justice
potter
stewart
or
by
her
estate.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
or
not,
she
died
or
get
married
an
hour
later.
justice
potter
stewart
you
distinguish
between
the
amounts
due
after
the
date
of
the
decree,
that
is
between
the
$42,000
and
the
additional
$30,000?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
assume
there
is
a
good
argument
for
the
$42,000.
do
you
think
the
$30,000
goes
with
that
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
all
deductible.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
government,
there
talking
about
this
connecticut
rule
in
(inaudible)
to
the
california
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
so
be
it,
i
can
remember
when
before
the
marital
deduction
when
states
were
considering
by
statute,
turning
themselves
into
community
property
estates
for
the
same
kind
of
a
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
no
such
claim
is
widow's
allowance,
(inaudible)
in
any
state?
