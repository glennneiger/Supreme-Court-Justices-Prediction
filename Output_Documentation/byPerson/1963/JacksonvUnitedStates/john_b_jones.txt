mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
section
812
(b)
(5)
was
repealed
and
is
no
longer
in
the
law.
if
there
is
to
be
a
deduction
in
this
case,
it
has
to
be
under
the
marital
deduction
sections
of
the
code.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there's
no
surviving
vitality
812
(b)
(5),
it
was
wiped
out.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
marital
deduction
and
to
realize
that
there
isn't
any
reason
of
natural
law
or
that
one
could
reach
by
logic,
why
an
estate
tax
must
have
a
martial
deduction
in
it.
estate
tax
existed
for
good
many
years
without
a
marital
deduction.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
quite
true,
but
i'm
talking
here
to
try
and
explain
what
the
marital
deduction
provisions
are.
the
reasons
which
i
assign
to
the
development,
the
marital
deduction
provisions
won't
have
anything
in
particular
to
do
with
the
corresponding
development
of
that
law.
and
i
would
just
like
to
make
sure
we
understand
what
the
marital
deduction
provisions
provide
and
then
if
they
repeal
812
(b)
(5),
causes
a
change
in
marital
deduction,
and
we
can
examine
that
as
to
that
point.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
wasn't
812
(b)
(5).
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yeah,
it
may
be
that
the
martial
deduction
provision
highlighted
a
possibility
of
distortion
that
had
existed
before,
but
as
i
say,
up
until
1948,
our
state
tax
laws
had
no
provision
for
a
marital
deduction
and
the
reason,
as
everyone
agrees,
is
that
in
order
to
equalize
the
burden
between
the
community
property
states
and
the
common
law
states
where
in
the
community
property
estates,
the
wife
is
considered
as
owning
half
of
the
property
all
along
and
that
half
of
the
property
wasn't
included
in
the
husband's
estate.
for
a
while,
there
was
an
attempt
from
that
42
to
48
to
reverse
a
situation
and
try
and
disregard
property
law
in
the
community
property
states
and
say
that
the
wife's
part
still
had
to
go
through
her
husband's
estate,
or
didn't
under
local
law.
that
didn't
work
and
then
congress
was
faced
with
other
alternatives.
now
there
were
lots
of
things
that
congress
could
have
done
to
meet
this.
they
could
have
done
like
credits
against
tax,
different
kinds
of
allowances,
only
special
kinds
of
widows
allowances,
a
whole
field
was
open
to
them.
and
what
they
picked
was
a
very
specialized
marital
deduction
provision
and
you
don't
have
any
natural
right
to
it.
you
either
come
within
what
congress
just
specified
as
a
marital
deduction,
or
there
is
no
marital
deduction.
now
this
doesn't
mean
that
in
interpreting
we
can't
apply
some
balance
and
try
and
work
on
the
purposes
of
the
congress,
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
there
must
be
somewhere
in
the
marital
deduction
provision,
a
license
for
the
construction
which
is
adapted.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
couldn't
answer
that.
i
don't
know
when
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
42
was
when
they
did
this
reversal
and
i
think
the
property
previously
tax
was
in
existence
at
that
time,
but
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no.
no,
not
at
all,
that
could
be
successive
generations
or
brothers
and
sisters
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
right,
right,
but
that
wouldn't
meet
all
the
problems
of
course
of
the
community
property
estate.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
able
to
supply
any
information.
but
when
they
set
up
the
marital
deduction
provision,
there
were
two
problems
with
which
they
could
legitimately
be
concerned
in
trying
to
equalize
community
property
and
common
law
estate.
the
first
was
that
in
--
if
you
give
life
estate
to
the
wife
with
remainder
to
your
children,
that's
something
that
a
man
in
a
community
property
estate
can't
do
because
wife
already
has
a
full
title
to
the
property.
and
furthermore,
that
life
estate
and
the
wife
as
we
have
discussed
earlier
is
not
going
to
be
part
of
her
estate,
being
incumbent,
we
can
presume
that
it'll
be
consumed
and
so
therefore,
it
won't
be
in
her
estate.
but
there's
another
problem
and
which
is
also
to
be
considered
that
in
a
community
property
estate,
the
husband
can't
put
any
other
strings
on
this
property
going
to
wife.
he
can't
wait
and
see
whether
she
is
going
to
survive
two
months,
six
months,
a
year.
he
can't
wait
and
see
whether
she
remarries.
so
he
can't
put
any
conditions
on
at
all.
as
of
the
instant
of
his
death,
that
property
is
hers.
and
if
you're
going
to
equalize
between
the
community
property
estates
and
the
common
law
estates,
you
would
not
want
to
allow
the
common
law
estates
to
have
a
condition
a
second
look
that
wouldn't
exist
in
the
community
property
estate.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
that's
a
necessary
judgment
or
one
that
you'd
have
to
make
or
one
that
you
couldn't
put
some
exceptions
in
it,
but
congress
didn't.
and
the
provision
which
congress
adopted
is
the
one
of
course
we're
concerned
with
here
today,
812
(e)
(1)
(b),
and
it
does
not
provide
as
though
it
covers
the
situation,
it
is
not
phrased
in
terms
of
making
sure
property
is
subject
to
tax
in
the
second
estate.
what
it
says
is
that
where
an
--
this
is
on
our
brief
page
21,
the
statutory
language
is
helpful
to
look
at
though
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
about
it
but
where
an
interest
in
property
may
terminate
or
fail
on
the
occurrence
of
an
event
or
the
failure
or
an
event
to
occur,
this
is
very
broad
language
and
where
another
interest
in
the
same
property
has
passed
from
decedent
to
some
other
person
and
that
person
will
enjoy
the
property
then
you
don't
get
a
marital
deduction.
now
that's
a
lot
more
than
you'd
have
to
say
if
all
you
are
going
to
do
is
say
we
want
to
be
sure
we
get
at
least
one
estate
tax
or
if
what
all
you
wanted
to
do
was
deal
with
the
life
estate
problem
and
it's
a
very
clear
mandate
and
it
is
in
the
section
under
which
the
petitioner's
here
must
claim.
it's
a
strong
arm
rule
with
the
exception
which
i
will
just
discuss,
it
doesn't
permit
of
any
exceptions
and
it
can
come
down
pretty
hard.
now
the
congress
did
say
one
exception.
if
you
want
to
put
in
your
will
a
provision
that
your
wife
will
not
take
under
the
will
by
unless
she
survives
you
by
six
months
or
you
may
permit
that
condition
to
operate
but
it
can't
be
for
more
than
6
months
and
if
you
go
beyond
the
6
months
period
in
you
will
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
operates
or
not.
now
just
to
make
it
clear
that
we
understand
the
way
this
provision
operates
and
it's
been
undisputed
and
accepted
by
the
courts
that
if
a
dying
husband
gives
$10,000
to
his
wife
on
the
condition
that
she
survive
him
by
8
months
and
she
does
survive
8
months
and
gets
a
$10,000
and
it's
going
to
be
in
her
estate
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
avoiding
taxation,
nonetheless
that's
taxable
to
his
estate.
the
congressional
mandate
is
absolutely
clear,
you
can't
beyond
6
months.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
(e)
(1)
(d),
yes
(e)
(1)
(d)
and
that's
clear
and
that's
been
interpreted
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
that
you
can't
–
simply
you
can't
say
i
give
my
wife
$10,000
you
can
say
it
but
you
won't
get
the
marital
deduction
for
passing
there
under.
you
can't
say
in
your
will
i
will
give
my
wife
$10,000
if
she
survives
to
the
date
of
distribution
and
that
won't
qualify
because
you
don't
know
that
the
distribution
will
occur
within
the
6
month
period
and
since
it
can
in
fact
can
occur
later
it
will
not
give
you
the
marital
deduction
if
in
fact
that
she
takes
it
inside
the
6
month
period.
she
still
cannot
get
the
marital
deduction
and
why
is
that,
is
because
it'
being
universally
established
in
all
the
cases
in
the
senate
report,
in
the
regulations
that
the
situation
has
to
be
viewed
at
the
date
of
the
descendant's
death,
you
don't
get
a
second
look.
now
this
is
the
law
of
the
marital
deduction,
as
we
find
it
and
i
don't
really
believe
it
is
disputed
by
petitioners
here
in
a
general
way.
the
question
is
how
are
we
going
to
apply
these
principles
to
the
specific
interest
here
in
question
and
the
question
--
what
we
have
here
and
i
think
was
not
emphasized
on
argument
in
chief
is
that
that
widow's
allowance
here
is
subject
to
two
very
specific
conditions.
this
has
been
found
and
can
be
found
in
state
decisions
interpreting
these
widow's
allowances
where
it
made
a
difference.
the
widow
gets
nothing,
if
she
doesn't
survive
until
the
date
of
the
decree
and
at
that
time
remained
un-remarried.
so
she
must
be
un-remarried
and
alive
on
the
date
of
the
decree
to
get
anything,
but
there
is
a
separate,
completely
separate
condition
which
is
written
in
to
california
law
as
to
each
payment,
no
matter
what
the
time
of
decree
for
the
period
to
which
it
applies,
she
must
also
be
un-remarried
and
alive.
there
are
these
two
conditions.
now
i
offer
to
the
court
–-
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
i
go
right
back
to
the
case
about
my
wife
survives
me
by
8
months.
she
survived
me
by
8
months,
she
got
everything
and
it's
the
condition
as
of
the
date
of
death
which
determines
in
the
8
month
case.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
don't.
if
what
we
are
saying
to
the
court
is
correct
as
we
believe
it
is
that
those
acquiescence
should
be
withdrawn
as
we
noted
in
our
brief
we've
only
not
done
it
because
this
case
is
in
litigation.
the
acquiescence
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no.
i
think
that's
like
the
eight-point
rule.
you
have
to
look
at
things
at
the
date
of
death
and
the
fact
that
the
conditions
do
not
occur,
the
statute
says
or
the
failure
of
the
event
to
occur.
they
don't
care
whether
it
does
or
does
not
occur.
the
only
question
is,
is
there
a
condition
in
there
and
if
there
is
a
condition,
you
don't
get
the
second
look.
this
brings
them
back
to
the
things
stated
in
community
property
estate
but
there's
no
second
look
in
the
community
property
estate.
everything
is
at
the
–
the
entire
half
of
the
property
goes
over
the
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yeah,
but
i
think
we
have
a
whole
half
for
what.
the
whole
half
for
a
complete
untrammeled
wife
--
excuse
me!
untrammeled
right
to
the
--[laughter]
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
what
the
100%,
a
complete
untrammeled
right
to
half
of
the
property.
the
reason
you
get
to
the
full
deduction
is
because
there
are
no
restrictions
on
a
clear
half.
here
we
suggest
that
within
the
language
which
has
been
adopted
by
code,
there
is
a
restriction
on
the
right
if
there
is
a
condition
as
of
the
date
of
death,
you
don't
know
whether
the
surviving
widow
will
get
any
of
this.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
oh!
yes.
there
are,
i
think,
three
in
the
tax
court
on
the
fifth
case
and
the
ransom
house
is
a
lump-sum.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
not
in
all
of
them,
but
in
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
believe
the
date
was
in
1962
in
gale
and
rudnick,
in
those
two
cases.
and
as
i
say,
there's
no
question
the
direct
acquiescence
is
inconsistent
with
the
argument
i
am
making
here,
but
i
think
look
at
a
time
when
we're
presenting
the
case
to
the
supreme
court,
it's
necessary
to
look
and
see
what
the
law
provides
and
you
can't
work
the
whole
future
cost
course
of
the
law
by
an
acquiescence
that
was
perhaps
not
as
thoroughly
thought
out
as
it
should
have
been.
now
i
think
it's
important
when
we
talk
about
these
cases
to
realize
that
if
decedent
in
california
had
made
a
provision
in
his
will
that
i
want
my
wife
to
be
paid
$3,000
a
month,
if
she
survives
me
un-remarried
to
the
date
of
each
payment,
he
doesn't
have
a
prayer
of
getting
the
marital
deduction
and
i
know
this
is
just
isn't
any
argument.
the
law
is
too
clear,
the
statute
is
clear,
and
we
don't
see
here
how
you
can
justify
saying
that
a
different
result
obtained
simply
because
the
state
law
gives
that
to
them.
actually,
the
state
law
should
stand
on
inferior
ground
and
historically
the
development
a
little
bit
to
try
and
pull
state
law
options
back
in
and
give
them
the
same
treatment
as
if
they
were
in
the
will
of
the
decedent.
but
there
isn't
any
suggestion,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rights
that
a
man
gets
by,
or
the
survivor
gets
by
state
law
should
in
any
way
be
superior
to
what
they
would
be
under
a
straight
will
condition.
and
as
i
say,
it
just
couldn't
be
clearer
that
if
this
had
been
in
the
will
of
the
decedent,
there
wouldn't
be
an
argument
for
the
martial
deduction.
it's
always
an
argument.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
we
would
say
that
that
will
turn
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
that's
enforceable
by
her
executors
as
a
right
which
you
can
predict
over
a
fixed
period.
if,
just
take
example,
it
seems
that
in
some
states
that
all
the
widow
had
to
say,
i
want
my
allowance,
thereafter
her
executives
go
into
court
and
get
it.
and
it
that
case
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
even
if
she
dies
the
next
day
or
remarries,
that
that
is
the
law
of
some
states,
the
connecticut
statutes
made
it
explicit
and
the
law
of
other
states
has
been
interpreted
that
way,
in
that
case
she
has
--
the
reason
why
the
martial
deductions
is
allowed
is
not
because
there's
a
difference
to
format,
because
she
has
something
that
she
knows
she
can
get.
now
it
is
true
that
we
have
--
the
regard
of
possibility
they
might
be
in
a
common
accident,
she
be
unconscious
and
couldn't
reach
up
and
scribble,
but
that
seems
to
us
to
be
small.
as
long
as
there
exists
a
right
which
she
can
do
immediately
after
death,
then
we
would
allow
it,
but
if
it
is
subject
to
things
beyond
her
control
and
we
say
that
death,
the
possibility
of
her
dying
before
the
court
gets
around
is
clearly
a
distinction
of
substance.
i
don't
know,
i
have
been
using
word
uncontrolled,
being
remarried
is
not
necessarily
uncontrolled
but
it's
to
avoid
that
condition
you
might
have
to
refrain
from
doing
something
you
wanted
to
do.
so
it's
something
that
the
widow
might
have
to
do
without
regard
to
her
rights
to
an
allowance
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
assimilate
those
two
together.
now,
as
i
say,
under
the
will,
there
is
no
prayer,
why
should
there
be
a
different
result
here?
and
as
we
see
it,
the
petitioners
make
two
main
arguments,
the
first
is
a
broad
one
and
it
appears
in
their,
most
explicitly
in
their
reply
brief
at
pages
1
and
7
and
they
come
out
quite
flat
footedly
and
say,
well,
the
terminable
interest
rule
does
not
apply
to
statutory
widow's
allowances
and
if
i
read
their
argument,
they
say
that
everything
else
in
812
(b)
you've
got
to
apply
but
the
terminable
interest
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
because
it's
going
to
disallow
a
lot
of
it.
well,
that
maybe
that
it
will
disallow
a
large
portion
of
them,
but
it
also
will
allow,
it
has
been
found
to
allow
and
under
the
basic
regulations
and
rulings
adopted
by
the
commission,
will
allow
also
a
substantial
number
and
if
there's
to
be
a
change
in
this,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
ought
to
go
to
congress.
there's
a
somewhat
anomalous
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
we
have
to
face
up
to
here
that
in
1948
when
the
marital
deduction
was
passed
and
this
gets
back
to
justice
stewart's
point
that
1948,
when
it
was
passed,
there
was
a
separate
allowance
and
they
were
rather
clear
that
this
payment
for
the
widow
couldn't
come
in
under
the
marital
deduction.
well,
in
1950
because
of
this
possibility
of
abuse,
they
removed
that
and
they
made
some
statements
about
law
and
at
least
some
of
the
courts
which
have
considered
the
problem
and
found
a
little
awkward
to
say
what
a
1950
report
can
mean
about
congress'
intention
in
1948,
when
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
at
that
time
didn't
intend
it
to
apply
at
all,
so
there
is
a
statutory
construction
problem
there.
but,
it
is
also,
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
1950
report
at
all,
it
is
very
clear
that
and
this
of
course
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
when
you
look
to
the
marital
deduction,
you
have
to
look
to
all
the
conditions
and
limitations
and
there
can't
be
any
warrant
for
taking
all
of
them
except
one.
the
basic
administrative
document
is
the
1953
ruling
which
has
been
cited
throughout
and
that
is
squarely
in
accord
with
our
present
position
that
you
looked
a
local
law
and
if
the
right
is
enforceable
independently
of
the
window's
survival,
then
it
qualifies.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
as
it's
been
pointed
out
for
–-
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
but
that,
you
see
the
point
is
that
–
it
seems
that
you
can
-–
a
reasonable
allowance
is
a
standard
that
you
can
live
with
and
you
can
say
we
can
let

little

always
there
but
nobody
else
can
take
what
is
found
to
be
a
reasonable
allowance
or
support.
she
will
get
whatever
that
is,
what
is
subsequently
found
to
be.
but
that's,
if
you
give
a
half
of
your
net
taxable
estate,
that's
half
of
what
a
subsequently
found
to
be
your
net
taxable
estate
but
there
is
sort
of
a
determination
of
independent
significance.
it
has
to
do
with
other
debts
which
are
recognized
and
so
forth
and
we've
never
held
under
the
estate
tax
but
just
the
dispute
as
to
amount,
the
amount
has
to
be
known
at
the
date
of
death
and
as
a
practical
matter,
you
could
not
so.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
but
he
has
some
experience
within
his
jurisdiction,
there
is
a
standard
of
living
with
the
widow,
i
would
think
that
the
probate
practitioners
in
any
district
could
give
you,
i
guess,
somewhere
in
the
area
where
the
amount
would
be,
what
he
would
allow
per
month,
it's
not
a
wide
open
field.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limitations
there
present.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
there
present
is
my
word.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yeah,
it's
on
page
10
of
the
brief.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
it
is
not
underlined
in
the
original.
the
words
do
say
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limitations
of
812
(e),
and
even
without
that
language
it
would
be
very
hard
to
allow
a
marital
deduction
just
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
those
words
were
in
the
pool
that
you
have
got
to
find
something
else
that's
basic
and
obvious
too.
conditions
and
limitations
maybe
you
have
to
have
four
things.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
at
footnote
on
page
8
of
our
brief
shows
all
the
cases
we
could
find.
they
are
6,
7
and
the
next
footnote
gives
the
ones
that
go
the
other
way.
actually,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court,
some
of
these
cases
in
the
top
footnote
or
where
people
who
have
been
strong
armed
in
defining
that's
a
law
estate
just
because
it
would
help
the
specific
case
for
the
widow's
allowance.
i
think
that
the
federal
court
by
and
large
is
neutral
on
the
point
and
the
last
one
in
bookwalter
and
phelps,
i
think
is
a
really
a
mangling
of
state
statute
in
order
to
allow
the
deduction,
but
that's
been
what
they
felt.
but
the
statute
of
connecticut
at
least
is
explicit
and
michigan
was
found
in
a
relatively
open
and
frank
contamination
of
the
law
to
be
that
way,
and
so
we
haven't
litigated
in
many
of
the
states.
in
fact
there
are
only
five
states
that
have
come
out
this
way
and
five,
the
other
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no
depute
about
it.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
then
there
is
law
of
california.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
this
point
is
unfortunately
clear
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
the
minute
order
was
decreed,
it
would
have
gone
to
her
executor.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
we've
agreed
with
this
all
along,
that
after
the
date
the
order
became
final
that
was
enforceable
by
her
executor.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
or
by
her
estate.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
perfect
clear.
now
that
would
have
affected
the
subsequent
things.
well,
as
i
was
seeing,
there
is
one
broad
argument
here
that
we
shouldn't
look
to
the
terminable
interest
rule.
we
think
that
by
squarely
and
invasively,
senate
report
language
it's
contrary
to
the
regulations,
it's
contrary
to
the
1953
ruling,
no
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
argue
that
you
don't
apply
the
terminable
interest
rule
and
in
fact,
as
we
read
the
briefs
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it
wasn't
even
contended
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
you
didn't
apply
the
terminable
interest
rule,
that
if
you're
going
to
hold
for
the
petitioners,
you
have
to
find
some
way
to
work
them
in
but
you
can't
disregard.
so
that
brings
us
to
the
second
argument.
i
think
that
what
has
to
be
the
main
argument
of
petitioners
and
that
is
when
we
talk
about
looking
at
these
conditions,
do
we
look
to
the
date
of
the
decree
or
do
we
look
to
the
date
of
death?
now,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
situation
in
812
(e)
(1)
(b)
on
the
six
months
rule,
it's
imperative
that
you
look
to
the
date
of
death.
the
whole
statute
is
built
around
looking
to
the
date
of
death.
the
1948
senate
reports
are
absolutely
clear
and
repetitive
on
the
point
that
you
must
look
at
the
date
of
death
and
regulations
have
always
adopted
that
and
in
every
other
context
except
this
widow's
allowance
people
have
agreed
that
it
just
has
to
be
the
date
of
death
and
that
this
has
been
applied
to
the
detriment
of
tax
payers,
and
in
cases
which
are
much
more
important
than
the
widow's
allowance
and
we
insist
that
in
the
terms
of
symmetry
of
the
statute,
you
must
apply
the
same
rule
here
but
we
have
to
admit
as
the
petitioner's
have
stated
that
the
tax
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
have,
after
some
hesitation
and
backing
and
filling,
finally
come
out
and
said
blatantly,
well,
we're
going
to
go
by
the
date
of
the
decree,
and
they
got
to
this,
we
think
by
dealing
with
the
cases
that
had
to
deal
with
election
by
will
and
in
our
earlier
discussions,
we
distinguish
those
because
typically
the
widow
need
only
say,
i
wish
to
elect
against
the
will,
and
then
she
topples
over
that
piece
of
paper
is
saved
and
the
executor
goes
in,
and
it's
enforced.
and
that's
the
typical
rule
on
election
against
the
will
and
we
think
that
the
cases,
the
dower
case
and
that
group
of
cases
which
talk
about
substitution
of
dower
and
so
forth
can
all
be
explained
in
those
terms.
now
there's
two
points,
i
should
mention
in
closing.
first
one,
the
taxpayer
argues
both
in
its
brief
but
before
the
ninth
circuit
really
only
argues
for
the
first
fourteen
months
of
payment.
we
think
that
there's
a
fundamental
fallacy
in
the
taxpayer's
argument
for
the
first
fourteen
months
payment
because
they
say
the
decree
must
be
related
back
for
purposes
of
eliminating
the
condition,
but
they
say,
of
course
you
preserve
the
date
of
the
decree
as
when
the
payment
is
made
and
all
the
conditions
are
fulfilled.
that
seems
to
us
to
be
an
inconsistent
possession.
you
can't
take
the
decree
back
solely
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
conditions
and
then
say
the
amount
paid
fourteen
months
later
can
be
looked
at,
at
that
time
and
having
eliminated
all
the
conditions,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
but
when
you
date
back
the
decree,
what
you're
really
doing
is
saying,
on
the
date
of
death,
a
decree
reads
you
shall
have
a
payment
of
$3,000
each
month
that
you
survive
and
are
un-remarried
and
that
must
fail
on
that
ground
alone.
if
you
date
back
the
decree
you're
given,
essentially
the
will
provision,
we
were
discussing
earlier.
and
then
just
lastly
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
really
no
argument
at
all
for
the
$30,000
and
there's
very
little
argument
for
the
$42,000.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
only
way
you
could
do
it
would
be
to
say
just
by
handling
the
terminable
interest
doesn't
apply.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
terminable
interest
rule
doesn't
apply
to
the
widow's
allowance.
if
you
said
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
all
widow's
allowances
would
be
allowable.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
they
didn't
care
about
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
some
of
the
later
statutory
provisions
have
talked
about
the
date
of
decree,
but
those
have
all
been
rejected
and
now
enacted,
discussed.
just
let
me
close
in
saying
that
judge
chambers
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
judge
blackman
in
the
eighth
circuit,
in
considering
these
opinions
sort
of
say,
that
they're
doing
it
reluctantly.
they
agree
with
their
readings
alone
and
find
it
incapable
and
i
think
they're
right
and
they
somehow
say
that
it's
a
shame
that
it
should
turn
on
state
law
and
that
we
ought
to
have
equality.
well,
i
just
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
nothing
you
can
do
is
going
to
produce
equality.
the
state
of
kansas
has
an
allowance
that's
limited
to
$750.
that's
all
what's
involved
in
the
state
of
kansas,
and
the
four
people
in
kansas
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
make
much
out
of
whatever
this
court
holds.
but
here
we
have
an
allowance
which
is
roughly
a
100
times
higher
than
could
be
permitted
in
the
state
of
kansas.
and
there's
a
case
in
the
court
of
claims
where
the
widow's
allowance
was
$400,000
and
nothing
that
we
could
adopt
as
a
rule
would
put
the
people
in
kansas
on
a
par
with
the
people
in
california.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
statute
what
congress
has
put
in
under
the
marital
deduction
does
not
allow
any
exceptions
for
these
widow's
allowances
and
that
the
treatment
should
follow
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
properly
said
in
the
cunha
case
and
in
this
case.
