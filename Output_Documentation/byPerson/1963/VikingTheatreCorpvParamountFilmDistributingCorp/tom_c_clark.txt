if
mr.
goldman
did
not
have
to
bid,
mr.
nizer,
is
it
true
that
goldman
did
not
have
to
bid
under
your
arrangement?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
only
prevent
those
of
paramount?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
they
invite
the
other
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
exhibitors
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand
that
the
arrangement
was
initiated
by
the
exhibitors?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
they
went
to
the
distributors?
justice
tom
c.
clark
somewhat
along
the
line
of
interstate
circuit
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
what
advantage
would
it
be
to
the
distributor?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
assume
they
asked
for
information.
i
just
wondered
what
is
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
perhaps
how
many
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
they
examined
this
invitation
to
the
remainder
of
the
exhibitors,
if
you
know
how
many
of
them
accepted
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
in
effect,
suppose
all
of
them
accepted,
then
they
would
get
a
--
the
split
would
be
all
the
way
down
the
line
and
get
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
to
bid
on
three
pictures
and
half
of
them
on
the
other
three.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
--
the
effect
of
that
would
be
to
eliminate
the
--
so
far
as
the
distributors
who
are
concerned,
half
of
the
bidders,
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
understand
the
--
if
i'm
on
the
firm
goldman,
i'm
on
this
side
of
the
three,
i'd
bid
on
those
three,
i'm
suppose
to,
is
that
right,
after
the
split?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
then
negotiate
later?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course
i'd
have
to
take
the
bid
wouldn't
i
if
i
knew
the
others
did
not
have
to
bid.
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
everyone
decided
they
wouldn't
bid,
everyone
had
that
option,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
tom
c.
clark
isn't
that
because
of
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
that
because
of
the
insistence
of
goldman
and
warner?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
don't
they
extend
it
to
everyone
then
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
for
two
years.
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
nizer
said
in
1955.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
only
written
on
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
is
in
the
evidence
that
--
it's
not
in
writing
that
it
was
trying
to
show
that
the
same
thing
had
occurred
in
other
pictures?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
was
--
mr.
williams
said
that
goldman
had
a
practice
did
not
bid
at
all.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
he
would
--
after
the
other's
bid,
having
the
advantage
of
their
bid,
would
you
know
what
the
bids
were?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i'll
--
i'll
take
that
back.
did
you
know
what
the
bids
were?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
would
know
that
whatever
the
bids
were,
they
were
not
sufficient.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
offer
was
sufficient,
i'd
suppose
that
the
distributor
would
accept
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
they
wouldn't
have
(voice

--
it
would
not
have
gone
to
goldman
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
say,
it
would
not
go
to
goldman
in
any
event?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
volume
is
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
can
you
give
me
those
two
pages
again,
just
