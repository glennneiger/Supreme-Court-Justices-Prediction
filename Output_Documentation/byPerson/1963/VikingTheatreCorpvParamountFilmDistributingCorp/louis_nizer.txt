mr.
louis
nizer
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
represent
all
of
the
distributors
in
this
case,
seven
of
them
with
the
exception
of
warners
and
fox
companies.
when
this
suit
was
instituted,
the
complaint
charged
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
certain
first
run
quality
motion
pictures.
this
is
not
a
deprivation
of
product
the
case.
in
the
ordinary
sense,
it
is
conceded
that
at
all
times
the
plaintiff
played
first
run
quality
motion
pictures
of
all
the
motion
picture
companies
though
he
entered
the
field
against
11
of
the
first
run
theatres
in
philadelphia.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
sir.
indeed
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
he
didn't
play
them
for
particularly
long
periods.
indeed,
he
complained
--
he
urged
as
an
argument
in
his
favor
that
being
a
small
theatre
of
only
1000
seats
roughly
competing
with
theatres
two
and
three,
and
four
times
this
size,
he
could
make
up
the
gross
because
he
would
play
long
times.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
quality
of
the
picture
determines
the
length
of
its
run
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
and
i
can
only
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
--
i
can
only
answer
it
this
way.
i'm
not
evading
the
question,
sir.
i
say
that
the
--
according
to
the
evidence
in
the
record,
the
quality
of
the
pictures
proven
by
box
office
receipts
determines
the
length
that
will
be
kept
and
there
was
some
evidence
that
in
certain
of
the
goldman
theatres,
they
didn't
have
good
enough
quality,
for
example,
the
midtown
that
was
mentioned
had
20%
less
quality
on
this
basis
and
therefore
played
more
pictures.
on
the
other
hand,
the
randolph
played
less,
so
that
i
can
only
say
that
the
figures
vary
in
each
theatre
depending
upon
the
guests
as
to
the
quality
of
the
picture
based
not
on
artistic
quality
but
production
of
the
box
office.
and
so
there
are
variable
figures
on
those
--
on
--
in
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you.
when
this
suit
was
instituted,
there
were
13
alleged
discriminations
set
forth
in
the
complaint
ranging
from
the
rejection
of
allegedly
superior
offers
by
viking
in
favor
of
inferior
offers
by
competitors
to
the
failure
to
screen
on
days
requested
or
advertising
clauses
that
were
different
from
other
advertising
clauses
but
the
word
"split"
never
appeared
in
the
complaint
as
a
discrimination
or
as
a
charge.
there
were
seven
pretrial
conferences
resulting
in
five
pretrial
orders.
not
only
was
there
no
allegation
that
splits
were
per
se
illegal
but
an
affirmative
order
was
made
by
the
court
on
consent
at
record
30.
the
question
was
whether
stanley-warner-goldman
splits
were
illegal
per
se
and
it
was
held
that
they
were
not,
it's
abandoned,
no
longer
an
issue
in
this
case
haec
verba.
at
the
trial,
the
plaintiff's
executive
realm
was
on
the
stand
for
20
days.
in
all
of
his
specifications
of
discriminations
and
grievances,
the
word
"splits"
never
passed
his
lips.
any
of
the
theories
that
we
now
have
about
--
that
are
now
presented
about
this,
of
course,
could
not
be
cross-examined
because
they
were
never
even
presented.
instead,
for
42
days,
7700
pages
of
the
record,
we
were
involved
in
the
trial
in
which
on
a
blackboard,
we
compare
the
chief
charge
that
superior
offers
by
viking
were
rejected
in
favor
of
inferior
offers
and
that
became
a
shambles,
the
plaintiff
out
of
his
own
mouth,
repeatedly
said,
"i
take
it
back.
now
that
i
see
that
i'm
wrong,
cross
it
off",
and
we
crossed
off
picture
after
picture.
and
all
of
his
other
alleged
discriminations
had
the
same
fate
and
there
was
nothing
left
since
there
was
not
even
a
proper
of
--
fact
of
damage.
there
was
nothing
left
but
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
end
of
42
days
of
trial.
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
there,
for
the
first
time,
although
the
chief
time
was
taken
up
on
all
these
alleged
discriminations,
reviewing
them,
splits
escape
their
anonymity
and
were
mentioned
at
least
as
one
of
the
ways
of
discrimination
from
which
circumstantial
evidence
of
conspiracy
could
be
spelled
out.
judge
biggs
allowed
a
full
day
of
oral
argument,
requested
cross
indexes
so
that
the
court
could
check
every
exhibit
and
every
bit
of
testimony
and
then
the
court
unanimously
wrote
a
31
page
opinion,
which
after
dissecting
the
plaintiff's
testimony
with
microscopic
care,
analyzing
each
of
the
distributors'
conduct
first
separately.
then
referring
to
the
continental
ore
doctrine
by
name
and
saying
we
now
look
upon
the
entire
matter
as
an
integrated
whole
and
giving
every
favorable
inference
to
the
plaintiff,
we
find
there
is
no
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
find
conspiracy.
but
the
court
of
appeals
went
further.
it
analyzed
the
new
argument
that
splits
were
illegal,
all
the
arguments
made
in
this
court.
and
they
found
that
it
was
not
unlawful,
that
splits
were
not
unlawful
and
that
the
evidence
showed
no
injury
to
the
plaintiff
therefrom.
then
came
the
petition
of
certiorari
to
this
court
and
for
the
first
time
that
was
contented
that
the
splits
are
the
conspiracy.
that
all
the
other
discriminations
flow
from
it,
the
phrase
used
is
syllogistically.and
splits
emerged
as
the
doctrine
of
law
upon
which,
indeed,
if
they
had
believed
in
it,
they
could
have
moved
for
summary
judgment
as
a
question
of
law
instead
of
trying
the
case
for
42
days
without
mentioning
it.
and
the
company
in
this
concoction
in
this
court
are
contrived
theories
in
the
brief
of
submarkets
which
do
not
exist
in
the
realistic
economic
life
of
this
industry,
alleged
monopolization
of
submarkets,
these
non-existent
submarkets,
monopoly
becomes
measured
by
computing
theatre
seats
and
incidentally,
manipulated
so
that
they
multiply
the
defendants'
exhibitor
seats
by
three
and
divide
the
plaintiff's
seats
by
three
on
the
theory
that
the
viking
had
to
enter
three
submarkets
therefore
one-third
of
the
seats
were
competing
in
each
market.
the
theory
that
by
storing
up
financial
resources
during
the
split,
the
defendant
exhibitors
were
able
to
give
premium
offers
against
the
viking
and
other
semantic
and
mathematical
legit
domain
about
syllogistic
inevitability.
and
all
these,
your
honor,
in
this
court,
without
any
record
to
support
it,
dismembered
from
all
the
evidence,
floating
in
midair,
detached
from
anything
in
the
record.
now,
when
one
concocts
such
a
verba,
there
are
1000
facts
which
rise
to
be
dealt
with.
the
new
theory
that
there's
--
this
is
a
monopoly
case
of
the
submarket
runs
into
the
fact
that
there
was
an
expressed
concession
cited
in
page
5
of
our
brief,
that
this
case
does
not
involve
monopoly
and
no
charge
of
monopoly
is
made.
that
position
wasn't
even
changed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
section
2,
the
monopoly
statute
wasn't
even
cited
among
the
statutes
involved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
necessarily
treated
with
this
simply
as
a
conspiracy
case.
the
new
theory
that
the
defendants
through
splits,
the
defendant
exhibitors
were
able
to
store
up
finances
to
make
premium
office,
subsequently
runs
into
the
fact
that
in
the
trial,
the
plaintiff's
entire
burden
was
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
the
plaintiff
that
made
the
premium
bids
and
that
they
were
rejected
in
favor
of
non-premium
bids,
lower
bids
or
offers
by
his
competitors.
and
the
new
theory
that
seats
are
the
determining
factor
in
this
so-called
submarket
of
monopoly
runs
into
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff's
insisted
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
in
the
court
below,
that
seats
aren't
even
a
factor
in
determining
an
evaluation
of
an
offer
or
a
bid.
he
was
asked,
supposed
a
600
seat
theatre
competed
against
radio
city
6000
seats,
would
the
difference
in
seats
be
a
factor?
his
answer
was,
"no,
sir."
and
in
the
reply
brief,
after
being
faced
with
these
references
to
the
self-stultification
of
the
plaintiff,
there
is
no
answer
to
these
contentions.
now,
what
are
splits
and
what
are
their
function?
due
to
television
impact
upon
the
industry,
there
was
an
alarming
shrinkage
of
the
number
of
theatres
in
this
country
and
also
an
alarming
shortage
and
reduction
of
motion
pictures.
and
so
there
was
a
shortage
of
products.
and
as
this
court
had
occasions,
to
mr.
justice
douglas,
to
say
that
we
will
not
compel
bidding,
competitive
bidding,
when
the
matter
came
before
you,
there
was
a
search
for
alternative
methods,
than
simply
competitive
biding.
and
one
of
the
alternatives
that
grew
up
in
the
nation
and
as
the
reason
for
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
12,500
theaters
in
this
country
opposing
the
viking's
position,
one
of
the
alternative
methods
was
the
splitting
of
product.
and
as
in
philadelphia
when
there
are
12
first-run
theatres
and
only
eight
companies
to
feed
the
12
mouths,
there
is
a
problem
of
whether
these
theatres
can
exist
and
this
--
this
is
one
of
the
outlets,
the
relief
and
ameliorated
--
amelioratory
process
to
say
particularly
the
little
theatres,
the
grassroots
splitters
throughout
the
country
that
want
the
splitting
arrangements.
now,
how
does
the
split
operate?
i'm
afraid
there
is
some
misunderstanding
from
the
pre
--
presentation.
very
rarely,
indeed,
the
record
shows
never
does
the
distributor
put
all
of
these
pictures
on
a
split.
apparently,
he
has
some
special
productions
and
he
doesn't
wish
to
put
them
on,
he
has
a
special
sales
policy.
the
two
exhibitors
or
there
may
be
more
come
to
the
distributor
and
say,
"would
you
mind
if
we
didn't
compete
against
each
other
on
your
product
coming
out
for
the
next
three
months?"
and
they
make
a
list
of
pictures.
no
terms,
no
financial
terms,
just
names.
and
presumably,
they
divide
this
list
to
have
parody
between
them.
and
the
distributor
is
asked
to
make
the
sacrifice
of
consenting
to
eliminate
the
competition
between
these
two
for
those
particular
pictures.
the
arrangement
is
always
terminable
at
will.
the
distributor
makes
no
commitment
to
the
exhibitor
that
he
will
receive
the
pictures
on
the
split,
not
at
all.
the
evidence
is
conclusive
and
there's
no
contradiction
of
it
that
the
split
is
always
subject
to
the
distributors
having
the
right
as
he
must
insist
to
recoup
his
money
to
offer
that
picture
on
the
split
to
all
other
exhibitors
in
the
territory.
the
exhibitor
makes
no
commitment
that
he'll
buy
that
picture
on
the
split,
neither
does
he.
indeed,
the
exhibitor
very
often
ignores
the
picture
on
his
own
split,
not
only
because
it
may
not
turn
out
to
be
attractive
to
him
for
practical
reasons
he
may
not
have
planned
that.
but
above
all,
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
uniform
testimony
without
contradiction
was
that
no
competitor
in
the
territory
was
affected
by
pictures
being
put
on
the
split.
they
all
had
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
bid
for
those
pictures.
and
indeed,
without
wishing
to
trespass
on
my
colleague
who
will
develop
this
fact,
just
one
statistical
fact,
i
leave
the
rest
to
him.
the
viking
was
interested
in
87
pictures.
of
these
48
were
on
splits.
the
viking
got
17
of
these
48
pictures
from
the
split,
proof
enough
that
the
splits
didn't
affect
it.
and
indeed
as
mr.
wolf
will
demonstrate,
stanley-warner
and
goldman
got
less
pictures
on
this
split
than
the
viking
did
of
those
that
the
viking
went
for.
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
25,
that
also,
i'm
afraid
was
a
misapprehension
here.
25
out
of
the
34
pictures
that
the
viking
got
were
by
negotiations,
your
honor.
25
out
of
34,
the
theory
that
he
was
compelled
to
bid
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
that
--
that's
in
the
record.
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
many
pictures
were
never
put
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
nizer
the
practices
vary
from
company
to
company.
columbia
pictures
for
example
had
what
it
called
competitive
negotiation.
they
never
had
bids
but
they
competed
with
negotiations.
each
companies
was
varied
and
the
plaintiff
who
lumps
all
of
the
distributors
together
here,
he
wasn't
--
you
can
hardly
find
the
name
columbia
pictures
in
his
record
because
he
only
went
for
a
few
pictures
and
got
one
of
columbia
whereas
he
went
for
metro
pictures,
the
first
year,
the
best
product
that
year
and
played,
i
think
11
out
of
18.
that's
how
well
he
did.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
a
fact
and
since
the
petition
for
certiorari
raises
a
legal
point
on
which
plaintiff
succeeded
in
getting
here,
his
attempt
to
review
the
facts
here,
it
seems
to
us
not
in
good
standing.
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
without
it,
they
are
dividing
his
property
either
secretly
or
overtly
and
that
is
--
would
be
a
violation
of
law.
and
mr.
stan
--
stanley
barnes,
the
assistant
attorney
general
made
that
distinction
in
addressing
the
small
business
--
mr.
louis
nizer
but
i
think
your
honor
as
the
goldman
case
held,
if
there
is
--
mr.
louis
nizer
the
practical
--
mr.
louis
nizer
if
--
if
your
honor
is
directing
the
question
to
the
practical
impact,
it
--
it
is
so
precisely
what
your
honor
implies,
namely,
that
it
--
the
record
shows
in
no
instance
that
all
exhibitors
did
or
negotiate
for
a
picture.
mr.
louis
nizer
there
were
always
exhibitors
missing
so
that
the
distributor
wasn't
making
an
enormous
sacrifice
by
consent.
it
merely
meant
in
this
case
he
had
one
less.
mr.
louis
nizer
because
without
it,
i
think
it
would
be
illegal.
one
divides
his
product
stopping
competition
for
his
product
without
his
consent.
mr.
louis
nizer
it
may
--
mr.
louis
nizer
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
nizer
it
gives
it
--
it
gives
it
i
think,
legality
your
honor.
without
it,
i'm
afraid
the
exhibitor
would
be
seizing
the
property
of
another
and
dividing
it
amongst
--
suppose
all
the
exhibitors
in
the
territory
said,
"we
won't
negotiate
a
bid
except
by
arrangement
on
the
following
pictures
each
for
each.
the
distributor
could
be
vitally
hurt.
it
may
not
affect
him
but
it
could
and
it
would
be
illegal.
and
the
--
that
distinction
between
the
consent
of
the
distributor
being
essential
was
made
by
judge
palmieri
who
was
your
honor
knows
deals
with
applications
with
respect
to
united
states
paramount's
decree,
and
he
said
concededly,
this
is
united
states
against
loew's,
quoted
at
page
34
of
our
brief.
concededly
any
arrangement
whereby
exhibitors
agreed
with
each
other
that
they
will
not
compete
in
the
buying
of
the
product
cannot
be
countenanced.
although
it
is
equally
clear
that
splits
of
product
with
the
consent
of
both
distributors
and
exhibitors
are
proper
and
that
same
contention
was
made
by
assistant
attorney
general
stanley
n.
barnes
that
appears
at
the
footnote
on
page
33
of
our
brief
in
which
he
said
and
he's
testifying
with
it
respect
to
the
report
of
the
subcommittee
on
small
business
select
committee.
he
said,
"i
threw
out
the
suggestion
that
in
the
situation
as
outlined
by
him,
it
would
seem
that
one
possible
solution
might
be
splitting
product
and
told
him
that
we
would
regard
an
agreement
between
exhibitors
to
split
product
as
improper.
but
that
we
had
not
taken
the
position
it
was
improper
for
the
distributors
in
such
a
situation
to
advise
the
exhibitors
that
they
were
willing
to
split
their
product,
as
long
it
was
--
as
long
as
it
was
understood
that
it
was
up
to
the
distributors
that
if
they
found
that
it
did
not
work
to
their
best
interest,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
changing
their
policy.
it
is
only
caveat
as
a
solicitude
for
the
distributors'
position.
and
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
took
the
position
in
two
letters
which
appear
in
the
annex
of
mr.
williams'
brief,
that
splits
are
legal.
indeed,
they
requested
--
the
antitrust
division
requested
several
of
our
companies
to
consent
the
splits
in
certain
territories
where
it
might
be
of
aid
to
the
small
theatre
and
we
did
so.
it
is
true
as
mr.
williams
points
out
that
in
those
particular
situations,
it
was
of
a
small
town
and
the
split
was
between
all
of
the
theatres
in
that
town.
but
i
failed
to
see
any
distinction
as
to
whether
there
are
two
or
three
or
four
theatres
and
how
many
are
joined
in
it.
indeed,
if
there
was
any
pernicious
effect
of
the
split,
it
would
be
more
pernicious
if
all
joined
than
if
only
two
or
three
joined.
mr.
louis
nizer
different
legality.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
certainly
not
if
it
were
illegal.
but
it
cannot
hurt
the
other
party
so
long
as
that
every
picture
is
submitted
to
all
exhibitors
in
the
territory
and
that's
why
the
distributor
insists
upon
it
incidentally
for
a
selfish
business
reason.
he
won't
speak
at
the
best
offer
and
bid.
he's
not
going
to
permit
two
people
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
i
say
that
the
evidence
--
where
the
evidence
is
clear
that
all
exhibitors
had
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
bid.it
is
not
only
legal,
it
is
a
beneficent
practice
which
these
12,500
theaters
in
the
united
states
have
joined
to
plead
with
this
court
not
to
declare
illegal.
they
opposed
the
viking
position
vigorously
in
their
amicus
curiae
brief.
i
may
say
in
connection
--
mr.
louis
nizer
he
did
bid
--
let
me
give
your
honor
a
direct
answer
as
--
by
skipping
to
that
point.
the
so-called
schwalberg
agreement
arose
out
of
the
effort
by
one
company
paramount
to
solve
the
problem
with
one
exhibitor
goldman
who
stubbornly
and
on
grounds
of
principle
as
he
felt
refused
to
bid.
he
said
that
bids
up
the
price,
it's
uneconomic.
i
will
not
deal
that
way.
when
paramount
said
this
is
legal
under
the
supreme
court
decree,
goldman
sued
paramount
and
said,
"you
are
only
submitting
pictures
to
me,
certain
pictures
on
bid
and
i
say
it'
illegal”,
and
he
brought
suit.
the
resolution
of
that
suit
was
the
following.
that
if
bids
were
requested
and
not
very,
very
rarely
or
bids
or
requested
on
bad
pictures
or
weak
pictures
but
in
some
certain
pictures,
if
bids
were
requested.
and
the
bid
did
not
bring
in
a
--
an
amount
equal
to
the
national
--
national
film
rental
requirement
which
is
set
in
advance,
the
minimum.
paramount,
as
any
other
company,
could
reject
all
bids
like
an
auctioneer
who
has
a
$10,000
property
and
its
highest
offer
is
$100.
he
rejects
the
bids.
in
that
event,
it
would
either
rebid
or
if
it
negotiated,
it
would
then
give
goldman
the
second
refusal,
he
having
refused
to
bid.
he
still
would
not
bid.
if
goldman
met
the
national
film
terms
or
exceeded
them,
he
requested
that
he
then
not
be
used
as
a
slaking
horse
to
go
across
the
street
and
improve
his
offer
which
was
the
highest
that
had
been
offered
by
anybody
up
to
that
point.
this
is
the
so-called
schwalberg
paramount
agreement.
mr.
louis
nizer
only
paramount
and
your
honor
we
say
it
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
legal
arrangement,
but,
we
needn't
stop
there.
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
this
and
my
time
wouldn't
permit
a
detailed
analysis
that
appears
at
2778
of
the
court
of
appeals'
record.
but
may
i
just
indicate
in
passing
that
the
evidence
contrary
to
what
counsel
advised
you.
the
evidence
shows
that
exhibits
d
(19)
and
d
(30)
which
are
at
2669
of
the
record
and
2677,
that
in
the
very
instances
where
paramount
had
rejected
this,
you
will
find
letters
sent
to
viking
and
all
others
saying,
"we
invite
you
to
negotiate
further
with
us,
to
negotiate
with
each
of
you".
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
on
the
uncontradicted
record
that
actually
--
i'll
read
from
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
after
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
every
picture,
incidentally,
there
were
only
four
pictures
involved
in
this
entire
matter.
and
not
only
did
the
viking
--
was
the
viking
invited
to
negotiate
but
it
actually
got
one
of
those
pictures.
and
that
picture
was
the
gallant
--
lucy
gallant
and
it's
interesting
to
observe
that
the
terms
were
of
such
a
nature
that
paramount
loss
$3000
on
that
picture
by
paying
for
advertising
and
the
viking
made
a
profit.
now
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i'll
have
to
run
only
to
the
conclusion
that
this
--
the
detailed
analysis
on
the
preceding
page.
the
conclusion
is
this.
the
evidence
as
a
whole
failed
to
completely
to
support
the
alleged
uniform
plan
of
distribution
incorporating
terms
such
as
those
embodied
in
the
paramount
agreement.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
a
jury
would
not
be
justified
in
inferring
that
any
distributor
other
than
paramount,
either
new
of,
acquiesced
in,
or
adhered
to
the
agreement.
and
this
is
the
uncontradicted
record
in
this
case,
one
or
two
of
the
instances
of
pictures
which
have
been
cited,
there
are
complete
answers
on
our
brief
too,
they
were
not
--
i
regret
to
say
correctly
analyzed.
now
i
go
back
to
the
indicia
of
the
splits
and
point
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
that
it
is
uncontradicted
that
the
viking
never
requested
to
be
included
in
the
splits
but
more
than
that
your
honor,
the
distributor
executive
testified
that
viking
was
invited
to
go
into
the
split
and
refused.
that
appears
at
record
1924.
and
when
mr.
williams
attempted
to
explain
that
refusal
by
saying
it
was
made
on
the
eve
of
a
certain
lawsuit
that
that
was
an
unfortunate
error.
the
date
as
appears
at
record
1923
is
september,
1955,
that
offer
to
join
the
splits
and
their
refusal,
september
1955,
one
year
before
the
suit
and
before
we
had
any
indication
that
there
would
be
a
suit.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
sir.
the
same
testimony,
that
they
called
everyone
and
then
i
concentrated,
whom
did
you
call
of
the
viking.
and
he
told
the
gentleman
he
spoke
to.
and
the
man
said,
"will
you
put
it
in
writing,
mr.
rim
(ph),
the
executive
of
the
viking.
and
he
said,
"i
certainly
will".
and
he
called
up
after
he
got
that
writing
and
he
said
no,
we'd
rather
not
to
go
in".
and
the
reason
he
would
not
join
the
split
as
all
other
exhibitors
were
invited
to
join,
the
reason
for
it
your
honor
is
this,
as
was
indicated
by
one
of
the
questions
before.
he
was
able
to
compete
for
a
100%
of
the
product
of
any
company
whereas
goldman
and
stanley-warner
could
only
compete
for
50%
by
virtue
of
the
split
arrangement
they
have
made
between
them.
and
it
was
an
advantage
to
him.
the
split,
i'm
sure,
was
not
arranged
to
advantage
him.
but
the
result
of
taking
out
one
competitor
from
the
market
certainly
is
an
advantage
to
another
competitor.
he
cannot
be
heard
to
complain.
and
the
analogy
drawn
with
pooling
arrangements
is
of
course
false.
in
the
pooling
arrangement,
you
merge
the
interest,
the
profits,
the
share
to
control
is
shared,
and
obviously
you
eliminate
competitors
against
the
remaining
competitors.
the
split
works
the
precise
opposite
way.
you
eliminate
an
offer
of
bid
for
a
particular
picture
thus
leaving
the
viking
theatre
with
one
less
competitor
to
compete
with.
how
could
he
possibly
be
hurt
by
that
in
ordinary
common
sense?
and
what
was
the
duty
of
the
distributor
in
that
case?
who
are
we
to
say
to
the
viking,
"we
want
you
to
approve
for
us,
competing
against
one
less
exhibitor
in
the
market."
was
it
necessary
to
do
that?
in
most
industries
there
is
no
auction
bidding
for
profit
and
when
we,
the
distributors
find
that
to
our
advantage
to
have
auction
bidding
in
the
form
of
competitive
bidding,
we're
advised
that
by
some
exhibitors
like
goldman
and
the
12,500
theatres
that
joined
here,
that
they
would
prefer
the
splitting
arrangements.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
district
court,
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
can
only
offer
my
interpretation
of
it.
the
offer
of
damage,
the
fact
of
damage
in
this
case
was
so
vacuous,
a
mere
schedule
without
an
expert
testifying
to
anything
completely
defective
because
what
the
plaintiff
did
was
to
average
the
receipts
of
theatres
two
and
three
and
four
times
his
size.
and
set
it
up
against
his
own
average
as
if
he
would
have
the
same
receipts.
he
included
nondependent
pictures
such
as
oklahoma.
he
included
pictures
in
which
he
never
had
an
interest.
it
was
completely
barren
and
defective
of
any
probative
value.
consequently,
the
lower
court
judge
lloyd
(ph)
said
that
--
and
invited
plaintiff's
counsel.
the
record
shows,
he
said,
"please,
put
in
some
--
some
evidence
of
damage
if
you
have
it."
and
this
is
all
they
could
come
up
with.
and
he
has
now
in
his
reply
brief,
the
plaintiff
virtually
conceded
that
that
wasn't
the
proper
schedule.
he
now
limits
it
to
two
theatres
the
midtown
and
the
viking,
which
are
a
little
more
comparable
and
that's
wholly
defective
for
reasons
--
i
would
rather
save
my
time
for
another
moment
if
your
honor
permits.
now
the
--
after
the
film
rental,
i
will
make
only
this
point.
the
counsel
stated
that
he
paid
higher
film
rental.
the
film
rental
of
the
plaintiff's
viking
theatre
equates
favorably
with
any
of
the
exhibitor
defendants
theatres.
if
one
eliminates
one
grievance,
one
grievous
error
of
judgment
made
by
the
plaintiff,
that
accounts
that
one
picture
for
16%
of
his
total
film
rental,
and
he
conceded
in
the
record
that
he
voluntarily
made
this
bid,
the
picture
was
the
man
with
the
great
rental
suit
and
the
trans-lux
theatre,
another
defendant
theatre
offered
a
100,000
guarantee,
and
then
has
--
his
anxiety
to
get
this
picture
bid
up
not
by
any
defendants
and
not
involved
in
the
split.he
bid
$106,500.
this
resulted
in
the
disaster
to
him
and
he
conceded
in
the
record,
i
would
just
like
to
read
that.
“did
you
make
this
offer
voluntarily?”
“yes.”
“nobody
compelled
you
to
bid
on
great
rental
suit
and
nobody
told
you
not
to
bid
on
any
(inaudible)
story?
that
is
a
matter
of
your
judgment,
right?”
and
he
say,
“yes,
sir.”
“and
if
you
make
a
mistake
in
judgment,
you
don't
expect
subsequently
that
either
your
competitors
or
the
motion
picture
companies
will
give
you
back
the
money
that
you
lost
due
to
your
bad
exercise
of
judgment,
do
you?
you
don't'
claim
that?”
answer:
“no
sir.”
now,
if
one
eliminates
that
one
disastrous
error
of
anticipated
receipts,
you
will
find
not
only
that
the
viking's
film
rentals
compare
favorably,
indeed
they
are
lower
than
most
of
the
comparable
theatres
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
save
if
i
have
any
few
moments
for
rebuttal
if
your
honor
will
permit
me
to
--
or
no?
mr.
louis
nizer
well
then,
if
i
have
a
few
more
moments,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
splitting
arrangements
throughout
the
nation
grew
up
and
in
philadelphia
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
will
stay
within
my
time,
sir.
now,
if
the
three
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
the
splitting
arrangements
in
philadelphia
began
three
years
prior
to
the
viking
coming
into
operation.
therefore,
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
that
the
splitting
arrangement
was
aimed
at
destroying
the
viking
is
of
course
obviously
not
true.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
detail
of
that
fact
in
that
case.
i
know
that
sometimes
in
some
companies,
the
distributor
would
make
the
separation
of
the
list
as
to
values
of
pictures.
most
of
the
time,
the
exhibitors
made
them
but
it
was
always
the
exhibitor
who
sought
the
privilege
of
splitting
and
the
consent
of
the
distributor
because
it
eliminated
their
competitive
bidding
would
state
that
was
an
advantage
to
them.
mr.
louis
nizer
only
from
a
view
point
of
enlightened
self
interest
that
he
would
rather
lose
a
few
dollars
if
he
does
have
to
lose
it
on
a
particular
picture
and
keep
the
theatre
in
business
and
have
a
better
healthy
market.
the
decline
of
theatres
in
this
nation
is
alarming.
and
if
a
distributor
seller
chooses
to
do
something
for
the
economic
health
of
the
nation
such
as
the
antitrust
division
request
them
to
do
in
some
particular
situations,
and
as
attorney
general
barnes
indicated
is
advisable,
i
do
not
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
designed
to
discourage
him
there.
mr.
louis
nizer
if
that's
--
mr.
louis
nizer
he
gave
him
no
advantage.
it's
a
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
distributor
which
he
makes
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
in
the
interest
of
keeping
the
industry
as
healthy
as
possible
to
have
a
longer
--
a
bigger
market
for
the
future.
mr.
louis
nizer
in
philadelphia,
the
--
there
were
some
in
--
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
say
fairly
on
the
record,
there
was
inchoate
evidence
with
respect
to
some
of
this
but
it
never
became
firm.
i
think
i'd
better
say
that
i
don't
know
of
any
they
had
accepted.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
oh,
it
would
eliminate
--
yes
for
any
particular
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
picture.
i
think,
even
pictures.
but
your
honor,
even
in
towns
where
the
split
is
among
three
theatres,
those
are
the
only
three.
they
still
have
to
negotiate
and
bid
for
the
pictures
and
one
theatre
may
get
60%,
the
other
only
20%.
pictures
were
continuously
bought
and
licensed
by
others
who
were
not
party
to
the
splits.
it
is
not
an
allocation
of
product
neither
the
distributor
commits
themselves
nor
the
exhibitor
to
get
that
picture.
mr.
louis
nizer
you
don't
have
to
be.
you
can
ignore
them
if
they
frequently
did.but
if
you
wish
--
mr.
louis
nizer
or
--
or
negotiate
either
way,
you
don't
have
to
negotiate.
but
if
you
do
negotiate,
you
negotiate
only
for
the
pictures
on
your
side
of
the
split
and
not
on
mr.
goldman.
mr.
louis
nizer
no
your
honor
because
you
have
in
this
case
11
other
theatres
that
do
bid.
and
the
trans-lux
for
example,
a
theatre
--
a
non-defendant
theatre
offered
a
$100,000
guarantee
to
get
a
particular
picture
here
and
there
are
many
other

in
short,
you
would
still
be
competing
against
11
other
theatres.
mr.
louis
nizer
then
the
distributor
would
simply
--
it's
true
they
had
that
option,
would
simply
negotiate
and
do
the
best
they
could.
sometimes
he
couldn't
sell
a
picture
at
all.
there
are
some
pictures
that
never
see
distribution.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
they
would
prefer
that
your
honor.
but
the
distributor
has
some
control
over
his
product
and
i
--
i
think
would
be
adverse
to
that
general
rule.
he
makes
too
much
of
a
sacrifice
in
some
instances.
but
i
think
the
exhibitors
would
dearly
prefer
that.
but
i
wish
to
call
your
attention
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
one
of
these
exhibitor
associations,
the
allied
states
association
representing
small
grassroots
theatres,
5000
of
them
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
theatre
owners
of
america,
7500
small
and
large,
and
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
motion
picture
litigation
that
they
have
joined
on
this
point.
mr.
louis
nizer
particularly
--
mr.
louis
nizer
particularly
small
theatres
your
honor.
the
allied,
it
represents
chiefly
the
grassroots
little
theatres.
(inaudible)
to
your
honors.
