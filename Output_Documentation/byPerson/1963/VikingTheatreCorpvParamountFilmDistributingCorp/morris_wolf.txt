mr.
morris
wolf
before
i
address
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
exhibitors,
stanley-warner
and
goldman,
i
beg
your
permission
at
the
request
of
royall,
koegel
&
rogers
who
are
counsel
for
the
fox
distributors
to
make
the
following
statement
which
they
asked
me
to
make.
fox,
philadelphia
and
twentieth
century-fox
will
not
be
heard
by
separate
counsel
because
of
this
court's
ruling
that
only
two
counsels
shall
be
heard
for
all
the
respondents.
they
rest
upon
the
separate
brief
which
they
have
filed
and
the
following
statements
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
were
fully
warranted
by
the
record,
and
i
quote,
“the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
product
of
twentieth
century
was
available
to
all
exhibitors
and
was
licensed
to
own
the
basis
of
open
competitive
bidding.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
become
interested
in
twentieth
century
pictures
until
after
march,
1955.
the
plaintiff
then
submitted
bids
on
15
pictures
and
of
these
licensed
and
exhibited
eight
just
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated.
the
product
of
twentieth
century
was
licensed
picture
by
picture
on
a
competitive
bidding
basis
except
where
no
bids
were
submitted.
its
product
was
not
split
between
stanley-warner
and
goldman
and
was
apparently
made
available
to
all
interested
exhibitors.”
this
is
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
counsel
goes
on
to
say,
"fox,
philadelphia
operated
only
one
theatre
and
was
not
a
party
to
any
split
of
product.
the
viking
does
not
claim
that
at
any
superior
bid
or
offer
by
it
was
rejected
in
favor
of
fox
philadelphia."
that
closes
the
quote.
i
acquiesce
to
the
position
of
the
fox
respondents
and
request
that
there
is
not
time
to
discuss
it
further.
i
pass
on
to
speak
of
the
charges
against
stanley-warner
and
goldman.
although
these
charges
are
in
many
respects
different
as
to
each
of
them
common
to
both
is
the
charge
that
there
are
separate
loose
agreements
with
various
distributors
and
with
each
other
terminable
at
will,
the
so-called
splits
were
illegal
and
injured
sley.
as
presented
to
this
court
by
mr.
williams,
sley's
case
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
case
as
it
was
tried
so
meticulously
for
10
weeks
in
philadelphia
before
mr.
williams
came
into
it.
there,
sley's
position
was
not
that
the
splits
were
illegal,
but
that
the
distributors
sold
stanley-warner
and
goldman
so
many
pictures
for
which
sley
had
made
better
offers
that
these
sales
tended
to
prove
a
conspiracy
to
starve
sley
of
product
and
thus
bring
about
his
ruin.
sley's
efforts
to
prove
this
charge
ended
in
failure
and
the
trial
court
had
no
alternative
to
directing
a
verdict
for
the
defendants
which
the
court
of
appeals
headed
by
chief
judge
biggs
unanimously
affirmed
in
a
careful
opinion
which
analyzed
all
the
evidence.
now,
this
court
is
told
that
although
on
the
surface,
this
case
is
just
another
of
a
hundreds
of
damaged
suits
brought
by
discontented
theatre
operators
to
get
the
courts,
to
give
them
better
pictures,
they're
alert
in
it
heretofore
unsuspected
legal
issues
of
heavy
import,
dominant
market
positions,
division
of
market,
monopoly
power
and
that
awesome
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
of
antitrust
litigation
per
se.
this
heavy
artillery
is
introduced
on
the
theory
that
the
court's
refusal
to
allow
sley
to
go
to
the
jury
seriously
threatens
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
our
country.
for
us
who
have
been
familiar
with
this
case
from
the
beginning,
the
attempt
to
create
an
image
of
harry
sley
as
a
modern
henry
v,
fighting
his
second
battle
of
agincourt
against
the
mighty
motion
picture
industry
makes
to
say
the
least
a
dim
impression.
the
evidence
which
sley
produced
showed
that
there
was
no
restraint
of
trade
or
monopolistic
practice
to
which
he
or
any
other
exhibitor
would
suggest
was
subjected.
no
interference
with
his
getting
all
the
pictures
to
which
he
was
entitled.
mr.
morris
wolf
he
ran
a
small
neighborhood
theatre
on
a
long
back
from
first-run
policy.
this
case
contest
--
concerns
not
sley
splits
in
general,
but
the
particular
split
in
this
case
namely
agreements
between
stanley-warner
and
goldman
consented
to
by
the
distributors
which
not
only
let
sley
free
to
seek
every
film
that
was
released
but
benefited
him
by
reducing
the
competition
he
had
to
meet
on
those
he
did
bid.
the
history
of
the
splits
begins
in
1951.
at
that
time,
stanley
had
six
first-run
houses,
goldman
had
three.
there
was
no
parody
between
the
number
of
houses
they
had
as
mr.
williams
has
suggested.
goldman
had
protested
continuously
by
argument
and
by
lawsuits
that
the
sale
of
pictures
by
bidding
was
pre
--
prejudicial
to
him
and
harmful
to
the
industry.
as
you
have
heard,
12,500
theatre
operators
feel
the
same
way
about
it
as
goldman
did,
and
they
are
asking
you
to
support
the
view
that
splits,
which
are
their
only
remedy
against
bidding
are
not
illegal
provided
in
no
case
do
they
prevent
any
outsider
from
bidding
just
as
generously
as
he
could
have
done
if
there
had
been
no
split
and
with
the
added
benefit
of
having
only
one
competitor
instead
of
two.
as
the
result
of
goldman's
protest,
mgm,
stanley
--
and
stanley-warner
agree
in
1951
that
stanley-warner
and
goldman,
each
would
seek
only
one
half
of
the
pictures
which
mgm
was
willing
to
have
split.
both
stanley-warner
and
goldman
understood
clearly
and
never
questioned
that
the
arrangement
in
no
way
was
to
interfere
with
mgm's
right
to
solicit
any
other
customers
they
had
wanted
or
any
in
the
pictures
it
had,
and
in
no
way
bound
mgm
to
sell
the
pictures
stanley-warner
or
to
goldman
or
bound
them
to
buy
any
of
mgm's
pictures.
by
the
spring
of
1953,
other
distributors
individually
had
consented
in
principle
to
substantially
similar
arrangements
in
every
case
preserving
their
freedom
of
action
with
regard
to
selling
their
pictures.
paramount
agreed
--
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
wolf
the
--
that
they
agreed
to
it?
mr.
morris
wolf
no,
i
think
it
was
because
they
felt
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
run
the
industry
just
as
the
exhibitors
did
and
just
as
mgm
which
was
the
strongest
in
the
industry
at
that
time
did.
mr.
morris
wolf
they
did.
mr.
morris
wolf
they
did.
mr.
morris
wolf
oh!
oh,
you
mean
why
didn't
the
distributors
immediately
go
along?
well
they
went
along
as
they
were
asked
gradually.
i
pray
they'd
probably
would
all
have
gone
along
at
the
same
time
if
they
had
been
asked.
mr.
morris
wolf
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
there
must
have
been
a
slip
up
of
some
clerk
in
one
case
out
of
a
total
of
87
pictures
of
which
you
made
here.
what
it
--
how
it
actually
happened,
nobody
knows.
it
was
just
a
clear
mistake
along
the
dating
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
in
all
the
testimonies
they'd
given.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
but
even
in
the
motion
picture
industry,
you
cannot
avoid
an
occasional
error.
it
was
not
by
any
means
a
matter
of
practice
nor
was
there
any
pattern
of
such
thing
shown
in
the
testimony.
i
think
i
can
show
that
a
little
later
on.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
wolf
no.
with
respect
to
the
schwalberg
agreement,
paramount
agreed
with
goldman
that
if
no
one
else
was
wiling
to
pay
what
paramount
wanted
for
a
particular
picture
on
the
goldman
side
of
this
split
and
goldman
was
willing
to
pay
it,
paramount
with
license
set
to
goldman.
that's
all
there
was
in
the
schwalberg
agreement.
mr.
morris
wolf
that
is
true.
mr.
morris
wolf
well,
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
an
advantage
of
that.
mr.
morris
wolf
no.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
he
did.
probability
is
that
he
wouldn't.
mr.
morris
wolf
so
there'd
would
no
--
there
would
be
no
--
there
was
no
evidence
to
whether
he
would,
whether
he
did
know.
the
probability
is
that
he
didn't,
because
a
distributor
would
state
what
he
wanted
for
his
picture
and
goldman
could
either
pay
it
or
not.
there
was
no
discussion
as
to
what
anybody
else
had
offered
for
the
picture.
mr.
morris
wolf
of
course.
or
else
it
wouldn't
have
--
mr.
morris
wolf
the
presumption
that
--
excuse
me.
mr.
morris
wolf
no.
the
presumption
would
be
if
they
came
to
goldman,
then
nobody
else
had
been
willing
to
offer
what
the
distributor
wanted
for
the
picture.
the
--
all
--
all
of
the
splits
had
been
arranged
as
has
been
said
openly
and
above
board
and
every
one
of
them
before
sley
ever
was
dreamed
of
as
a
theatre
owner
or
operator
in
central
philadelphia.
as
far
as
the
respondents
were
concerned,
sley
wasn't
even
born
when
these
splits
were
arranged.
now,
i'll
tell
you
how
he
came
into
the
picture.
by
1953,
due
to
the
impact
of
radio
and
television
as
mr.
nizer
has
said,
there
were
not
enough
quality
pictures
released
to
supply
all
of
the
theatres
seeking
them
in
central
philadelphia.
goldman
had
given
--
i
mean
stanley-warner
had
given
up
two
of
its
six
theatres
and
it
still
could
not
get
enough
products.
so
it
decided
that
in
order
to
help
the
other
theatres
it
had
--
it
would
sell
the
alden
theatre
which
was
the
poorest
of
its
four
remaining
houses.
for
obvious
reasons,
he
didn't
intend
to
sell
the
property
to
anyone
who
would
use
it
as
a
picture
house.
sley,
a
well
known
garage
and
parking
lot
operator
offered
to
buy
the
property
for
remodeling
as
he
said
into
a
garage.
relying
on
this
expression
of
sley's
purpose,
stanley-warner
sold
the
property
to
him
and
he
carrying
out
what
had
been
his
concealed
purpose
from
the
beginning,
fixed
it
up,
gave
it
a
belligerent
name
of
the
ancient
north
sea
pirates
viking
and
became
one
of
12
city
houses,
seeking
first-run
pictures.
if
sley
charges,
the
respondents
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
sabotage
his
operation
from
the
date
he
opened,
one
would
have
expected
them
to
try
to
choke
him
off
before
he
got
joined.
following
brutus'
advised
to
julius
caesar,
think
him
as
a
serpent's
egg
which
hatched,
would
as
his
kind,
grow
mischievous
and
kill
him
in
his
shell.
when
most
"shakespeare"
in
this
anniversary
week.
if
they
didn't
sell
--
if
they
didn't
kill
sley,
on
the
contrary
for
his
opening,
sley
got
exactly
the
picture
he
wanted.
the
student
prince,
got
it
from
mgm,
the
outstanding
company
in
the
business,
although
in
fact,
the
picture
was
on
goldman's
side
of
the
split.
and
from
that
time
until
this
suit
was
brought,
despite
the
shortage
of
product,
sley
continuously
got
first-run
pictures
from
the
very
distributors
and
now
sues
as
conspirators.
during
that
entire
period,
he
never
complained
to
stanley-warner
or
goldman
and
their
first
knowledge
that
they
too
were
supposed
to
be
conspirators
because
when
they
got
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
history
of
how
well
sley
faired
when
his
path
crossed
theirs
in
seeking
pictures
explains
why
he
hadn't
complained.
during
the
two
and
a
quarter
years
involved
in
the
action,
the
philadelphia
exhibitors
played
468
pictures
of
which
sley
made
some
effort
to
buy
87.
as
to
the
other
381,
any
or
all
of
which,
sley
was
at
perfect
liberty
to
see
--
sley's
counsel
stated
frankly
in
their
brief
and
the
court
of
appeals.
there
were
some
hundreds
of
pictures
on
which
plaintiffs
elected
not
to
bid.
sley
selected
only
87
because
of
the
entire
468,
they
were
the
only
ones
that
he
wanted.
as
to
these,
sley
does
not
deny
that
the
door
was
opened
to
him
at
the
trial
as
far
as
the
door
can
be
opened,
to
put
in
every
particle
of
evidence
which
he
wanted
to
offer.
these
pictures
were
diagnosed,
x-rayed,
psychoanalyzed,
(inaudible)
--
postmortem
and
quartered.
and
this
is
why
they
merged.of
the
87,
sley
got
37
for
the
viking,
stanley-warner
and
goldman
together
got
36
or
six
for
each
of
their
six
houses.
now
if
sley
had
any
complaint
against
stanley-warner
or
goldman,
it
must
be
about
the
36
pictures
they
got.
he
certainly
could
not
complain
to
stanley-warner
or
goldman
about
the
37
pictures
he
himself
got,
nor
could
he
complain
about
the
14
pictures
which
neither
he
or
stanley-warner,
nor
goldman
got.
so
we
now
consider
whether
those
36
pictures
were
sold
to
stanley-warner
and
goldman
in
this
regard
of
sley's
rights.
in
this
case
there
was
no
direct
proof
of
the
conspiracy
not
even
the
conventional
evidence
of
clandestine
meetings,
secret
conversations,
confidential
letters
or
a
loose
talk
in
which
some
blundering
salesmen
at
a
bibulous
party
made
damaging
admissions
about
a
plot
against
sley.
the
only
circumstantial
evidence
which
could
be
of
probative
value
would
be
evidence
that
the
conspirators
frequently
according
to
a
discernible
pattern
of
conduct
sold
pictures
to
the
favorite
exhibitors
on
terms
so
much
less
advantageous
than
sley's
offer.
that
a
reasonable
person
would
think
that
they
had
a
malicious
and
deliberate
purpose
to
deprive
sley
of
pictures
to
which
he
was
entitled.
in
the
brief
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
was
the
claim
that
was
made.viking's
bids
offering
terms
superior
to
those
proposed
by
the
defendant
exhibitors
were
routinely
rejected
if
they
were
the
defendant
exhibitors.
in
support
of
this,
sley
charged
that
25
of
the
36
pictures
which
stanley-warner
and
goldman
got
were
sold
to
them
although
sley
had
made
superior
bids
with
these
25
pictures.
the
fantastic
way
in
which
sley
tried
to
prove
this
case
in
the
lower
court
was
so
much
riddled
on
cross
examination
of
his
witness
that
he
was
compelled
to
admit
the
judge
by
his
results
with
other
pictures,
sley's
bids
were
inferior
to
those
of
stanley-warner
and
goldman
on
these
25
pictures.
sley
does
not
any
longer
argue
here
that
the
licensing
of
these
pictures,
the
stanley-warner
and
goldman
was
dishonest.
his
change
of
front
in
this
court
forced
him
to
this
surrender.
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
sley
had
taken
the
position
that
the
greater
seating
capacity
of
the
stanley-warner
and
goldman
theatres
over
viking
was
not
a
factor
at
all
which
justified
the
distributors
in
deciding
to
sell
their
pictures
to
those
houses
rather
than
the
viking.
sley's
manager,
as
mr.
nizer
has
said,
testified
emphatically
that
the
greater
number
of
seats
was
absolutely
no
factor
in
determining
the
grossing
ability
of
the
theatres
as
proven
he
said,
by
the
fact
that
the
stanley
warner's
4000
seat
may
as
bound
had
to
be
taken
down
because
they
couldn't
fill
the
seats.
in
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
which
i
see
mr.
williams
name,
appears
the
famous
footnote
72
on
page
48
although
the
mastbaum
had
4378
seats
to
the
viking's
1017,
the
extra
seats
were
a
liability
rather
than
an
asset.
stanley-warner's
president
admitted
that
the
mastbaum
was
obsolete
in
1954.
so,
when
mr.
williams
came
up
with
his
new
theory
that
the
great
seating
capacity
of
the
stanley-warner
and
goldman
houses
gave
them
buying
power
amounting
almost
to
monopoly,
he
ran
head
on
into
sley's
prior
contrary
position.
he
then
was
faced
with
the
alternative
of
agree
--
arguing
that
the
sale
of
pictures
to
stanley-warner
and
goldman
were
not
justified
because
as
sley
had
asserted,
their
seating
capacity
was
no
factor
in
calculating
their
gross
ability
or
of
contradicting
sley
and
admitting
that
the
sales
were
justified
because
seating
capacity
was
of
vital
decisive
factor
than
grossing
ability.
he
took
the
latter
view
and
abandoned
sley's
position
that
the
great
seating
capacity
with
stanley-warner
and
goldman
did
not
justify
the
awards
of
pictures
to
them.
but
where
did
this
leave
sley?
if
stanley-warner
and
goldman
got
it
--
the
only
pictures
which
sley
also
wanted
for
legitimate
business
reasons,
what
ground
was
left
for
complaints
by
sley?
none.
thus
left
high
and
dry.
sley
conceded
in
his
brief
in
this
court
frankly
that
if
his
evidence
of
conspiracy
was
limited
to
the
87
pictures
which
he
wanted,
"he
could
not
give
a
coherent
statement
of
the
conspiracy."
in
this
crisis,
sley
made
his
offers
in
the
trial
court
to
include
evidence
about
the
371
pictures
which
he
had
elected
not
to
see.
these
offers
were
considered
carefully
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
found
to
contain
no
matter
of
probative
value.
for
this
finding,
the
court
of
appeals
is
held
up
to
this
court
as
both
ignorant
and
prejudice,
terms
which
sound
to
us
who
are
familiar
with
that
court
as
singularly
inappropriate.
the
first
offer
was
to
show
that
viking
got
a
disproportionately
small
number
of
films
with
high
national
film
rentals
over
$3
million
and
that
this
was
viewed
of
the
dominant,
economic
market
power
of
the
exhibitors.
let
us
see.
during
the
two
and
a
quarter
years,
there
were
55
such
pictures
released.
of
this
55,
20
were
among
the
87
which
vikings
sought.
of
those
20,
viking
got
two.
and
stanley-warner
and
goldman
10
for
their
six
houses
less
than
two
a
piece.
one
of
sley's
by
the
way
was
not
as
a
stranger,
a
very
tough
$6
million
which
was
on
stanley-warner
side
of
the
split,
was
bid
for
by
stanley-warner,
and
nevertheless
was
sold
to
sley.
so,
there
were
35
of
these
pictures
which
sley
did
not
seek.
since
sley
did
not
seek
any
of
them
of
course,
he
didn't
get
any
of
them.
but
nevertheless,
he
claims
that
the
fact
that
stanley-warner
and
goldman
who
did
seek
them,
got
many
of
them,
was
probative
value
of
the
conspiracy
against
him
and
to
benighted
third
circuit
made
an
egregious
error
in
not
considering
it
as
such.
this
raises
interesting
questions
as
to
sley's
mental
processes.
in
order
to
avoid
a
charge
of
conspiracy,
thus
sley
suggests
that
the
distributors
and
stanley-warner
or
goldman
had
to
go
to
see
him
and
inquire
whether
it
would
be
satisfactory
to
him
if
the
distributors
sold
these
pictures
which
he
had
not
sought
to
stanley-warner
or
goldman,
and
whether
the
terms
proposed
were
alright
with
sley,
and
if
sley
did
not
approve
that
in
his
view
that
the
distributor
should
bury
the
pictures
in
the
ground
and
kill
sley,
either
sought
them
for
himself
or
graciously
change
his
mind
and
allow
the
sale
to
be
made
to
stanley-warner
or
goldman.
his
second
offer
was
to
prove
that
stanley-warner
and
goldman
got
many
more
rental
adjustments
than
he
got.
of
these,
an
insignificant
number,
we're
on
the
381,
were
--
were
all
(inaudible)
insignificant
number,
were
on
the
381
in
which
he
was
not
interested.
on
the
87
in
which
he
was
interested,
he
faired
better
than
stanley-warner
or
goldman
did.
why
adjustments
were
granted
in
this
particular
case
would
require
a
separate
trial
as
to
each
picture.
but,
we
come
back
to
the
underlying
inquiry.
did
the
respondents
always
owe
sley
a
duty
to
allow
him
to
decide
when
adjustments
should
be
granted
and
in
what
amounts
even
in
the
case
of
pictures
which
he
didn't
want?
finally,
sley
offered
to
show
and
stanley-warner
and
goldman
played
more
pictures
than
he
did,
that
the
national
film
rental
of
their
pictures
was
more,
that
he
had
to
play
his
pictures
longer,
that
he
had
to
pay
more
for
them,
always
he
had
to.
why
did
he
have
to?
he
--
why
--
with
a
hundred
and
--
with
468
pictures
released,
why
did
he
seek
only
87
of
them?
if
there
were
59
$3
million
pictures
released,
why
did
he
pass
up
39
of
them?
he
deliberately
and
voluntarily
adopted
and
carried
out
as
was
his
right
the
policy
with
respect
to
the
pictures
he
sought,
which
he
considered
best
for
his
theatre.
he
now
thinks
perhaps
he
would've
done
better
to
have
sought
more
pictures,
played
them
in
shorter
time
and
paid
less
for
them.
but
had
he
the
right
not
only
to
set
the
policies
for
his
own
house
but
to
set
the
policies
for
stanley-warner
and
goldman
houses
as
well,
and
tell
them
how
many
pictures
they
should
play,
and
how
long,
and
what
they
should
play
for
them.
in
effect,
sley's
position
with
regard
to
the
381
pictures
which
he
scorned
is
like
that
of
a
girl
who
flatly
turns
down
an
ardent
suitor
for
her
hand,
but
demands
the
right
to
pass
judgment
on
any
other
girls
he
may
want
to
woo.
with
freudian
forgetfulness,
sley,
in
setting
out
the
statutes
involved
in
his
brief,
omitted
any
reference
to
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
on
which
his
entire
right
of
recovery
depends
and
he
now
sees
himself
not
as
a
plaintiff
in
an
ordinary
private
antitrust
case,
but
as
an
ad
hoc
deputy,
protecting
the
attorney
general
and
speaking
on
behalf
of
all
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
whatever
may
be
the
terms
of
others
splits,
the
splits
involved
in
our
case,
violated
no
antitrust
act,
violate
and
injured
no
private
party,
least
of
all
sley
who
was
immeasurably
helped
by
them
in
his
unrestricted
pursuit
of
pictures
which
he
did
want
because
he
did
not
have
to
compete
for
them
with
both
stanley
and
goldman,
with
only
one
of
them.
mr.
morris
wolf
doesn't
--
doesn't
it
sound
solely
to
tell
us
quite
a
--
quite
a
tremendous
economic
power
these
two
theatres
had.
and
then
to
say
that
because
they
could
save
a
few
dollars
possibly,
there's
no
evidence
that
they
did,
by
buying
pictures
on
which
there
was
no
competition
from
distributors
who
are
much
larger
than
they
and
well
able
to
care
of
themselves.
they
were
in
a
position
to
overbid
sley
on
the
pictures
he
wants,
when
the
evidence
is
not
that
he
complained
that
they
overbid
him,
but
that
they
got
the
pictures
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
underbid
him.
the
economic
game,
which
indirectly
might
have
resulted,
if
they
had
been
able
to
get
their
pictures
more
cheaply
as
a
result
of
his
staying
out
of
the
market
and
as
a
result
of
their
split,
is
so
infinitesimal
and
so
unproven
that
it
certainly
amounts
to
no
evidence.
nor
can
sley
complain
of
the
fact
that
these
two
people
did
not
compete
when
he
was
not
in
the
field
himself.
there's
no
law
in
the
world
that
makes
it
essential
that
people
must
compete
against
each
other
if
there
were
some
pictures
which
stanley-warner
did
not
want
or
which
goldman
did
not
want.
there's
no
reason
why
they
should've
competed
against
each
other,
to
get
what
products
they
did
not
want
and
the
split
was
merely
a
question
of
settling
which
was
the
product
they
didn't
want.
if
without
producing
anymore
evidence
of
the
conspiracy
than
sley
did,
--
may
i
finish
my
sentence?
mr.
morris
wolf
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
a
jury
and
gamble
that
the
bewildered
jurors,
floundering
and
foundering
in
mr.
gladstone's
words,
in
the
morass
of
7500
pages
of
names,
states
and
figures,
may
give
him
a
verdict
then
every
entrance
into
the
motion
picture
business
as
a
probable
plaintiff
in
an
antitrust
suit
because
no
exhibitor
ever
got
all
the
pictures
he
wanted.
mr.
morris
wolf
the
courts
what?
mr.
morris
wolf
oh,
no
they
--
they
--
they
did
--
mr.
morris
wolf
--
i
think,
at
least
inferentially,
passed
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
injury
to
him.
mr.
morris
wolf
i
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
conceive
myself,
even
attempting
to
answer
a
question
which
is
based
on
the
--
in
--
on
the
illegality
of
the
split
which
can
--
which
constituted
no
restraint
of
trade.
i
can't
answer
the
question.
