justice

white
but
they
don't
deny
it
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
admitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
urged
the
--
urged
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
williams,
that
issue
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it,
it
was
by
the
court
--
district
court
but
not
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
on
the
question
of
damage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
that
was
passed
on
by
the
district
court
but
not
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
or
illegal
entry
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
antitrust
provision
agrees
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
taken
any
position
of
the
court
anywhere
that
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
these
splits
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
their
position
must
be
hearsay
such
kind
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
in
administering
the
paramount
(inaudible)
are
they
--
are
they
opposed
in
the
split
in
operation
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judge
has,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judge
has
in
that
case,
i
suppose,
the
paramount
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
whether
--
whether
this
one
is
a
series
of
three
party
agreement
or
an
overall
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
each
of
the
distributors
agreed
with
each
other
to
--
on
each
--
each
person's
split
arrangement.
i
don't
suppose
--
i
thought
that
each
distributor
had
his
own
acquiescence
or
agreed
to
the
--
to
his
own
split
arrangement
with
--
with
stanley
and
goldman,
you
had
the
same
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nizer,
you
--
is
there
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
long
runs
plaintiff
made
the
pictures
of
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
deliberate
policy
to
play
pictures
for
long
--
for
long
periods?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
but
--
but
didn't
--
didn't
the
goldman
theatres
play
more
pictures
in
a
year
than
the
viking?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
how
about
just
a
pure
fact
of
--
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
or
something
you
said
that
what
--
what
the
--
this
is
the
distributors'
consent
as
to
a
split
agreement
between
two
--
two
exhibitors.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
a
--
but
--
but
as
a
matter
regardless
of
the
legality,
part
of
it
mr.
nizer,
this
is
a
matter
of
operation.
would
it
make
any
difference
to
--
in
the
operation
of
the
system
whether
distributors
consented?
if
two
--
if
two
chain
exhibitors
agreed
on
a
split
and
all
that
would
mean
as
far
as
the
distributor
is
concerned,
is
it
--
is
it
only
one
or
the
other
would
be
bidding
on
certain
pictures.
the
distributor
can't
make
that
bid,
i
don't
suppose,
he
could
offer
it
to
them
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
--
but
how
about
if
they
--
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
anyone
want
the
exhibitors
--
the
distributor
to
consent
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
no
practical,
i
mean
--
practically,
why
would
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
exhibitors
want
the
distributors'
consent.
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
split
arrangement,
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
any
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
(inaudible)
said
the
--
of
the
distributor,
you
suggest
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
ensure
legality,
that's
because
without
the
consent,
the
distributor
might
be
able
to
sue
for
an
illegal
agreement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
recover
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if
it
so
happened
that
the
split
didn't
include
everybody
and
the
split
hurt
some
other
parties,
other
than
the
--
other
than
the
--
than
the
distributor.
certain
--
would
the
distributors'
consent
insulate
the
otherwise
illegal
agreements?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
seems
to
go
to
--
this
seems
to
me,
they
go
to
the
question
of
legal
injury
or
damage
to
some
third
party
and
say,
that
they
just
couldn't
hurt
them.even
if
it
was
illegal
it
couldn't
hurt
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nizer,
you
say
that
the
viking
couldn't
have
been
hurt
by
this
arrangement?
why
--
why
was
it
--
do
you
suppose
that?
i'm
just
curious,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
get
to
this
question?
that
there
was
a
--
there
they
--
at
the
outset,
there
was
not
an
illegal
arrangement
so
it
didn't
have
to
reach
this
question
at
all.
the
district
court
did,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wolf,
a
good
deal
of
your
argument
again
goes
to
the
--
the
question
of
damage
to
the
--
to
the
plaintiff
here,
now
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
--
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
i
or
anyone
else
thinks
this
that
--
that
the
--
assume
that
you're
wrong
on
the
legality
of
this
--
of
this
split
arrangement
and
you
must
get
to
the
next
issue,
what
would
you
suggest
the
court
do,
to
--
to
decide
it
here
or
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
then
