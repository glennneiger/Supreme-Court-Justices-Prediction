justice
potter
stewart
so
far,
you've
just
referred
to
an
agreement
between
goldman
and
stanley-warner.
justice
potter
stewart
not
involving
the
distributors
at
all,
isn't
that
correct,
up
to
now?
justice
potter
stewart
did
anybody
else
ever
--
did
anybody
else
ever
exhibit
a
fox
picture
during
the
period
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
whose
they?
who
allowed
them?
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
exhibitors
did
show
the
fox
pictures
over
the
period
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
to
show
that
viking
could've
be
it
on
any
fox
pictures
any
time?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
at
least
so
far
we
know
they
--
they
got
at
least
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
probably,
i
guess
the
both,
as
--
as
it
would
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there'd
been
no
such
a
great
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
schwalberg
testimony?
justice
potter
stewart
and
who
is
--
what
title
--
what
position
did
schwalberg
--
justice
potter
stewart
president
of
paramount.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
wait
a
minute.
i
--
you
--
you
went
a
little
fast
at
least
for
me.
if
he
commend
the
philadelphia
with
a
film,
i
--
i
suppose
his
interest
wasn't
getting
the
highest
price,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
--
you
told
us
that
under
this
agreement
that
--
under
the
split
agreement,
goldman,
if
it
--
it
was
a
goldman
--
if
it
was
a
goldman
split,
stanley-warner
couldn't
bid
on
it,
fox
didn't
bid
on
it
and
goldman
wouldn't
bid
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
was
to
prevent
viking
from
bidding
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
be
--
to
the
interest
of
the
distributor
to
get
the
highest
price?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
he
couldn't
go
to
goldman
and
say,
"let's
negotiate
on
it,"
even
on
the
schwalberg
agreement
until
he
had
rejected
all
bids,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
wasn't
--
you're
suggesting
there's
some
phony
about
this?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
contention
that
the
so-called
schwalberg
agreement
was
an
agreement
among
to
what
people?
justice
potter
stewart
whose
product
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
united
artist.
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
a
murder
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
you're
trying
to
make
it,
i
appreciate.
but
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
under
the
agreement,
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
at
least
that
the
--
that
viking
was
free
to
bid
on
every
picture
and
that
the
highest
bidder
will
get
the
picture.
justice
potter
stewart
like
how
--
how
could
this
be
a
conspiracy
against
viking,
the
fact
that
a
couple
of
exhibitors
among
themselves
would
agree
not
to
bid
against
each
other?
justice
potter
stewart
i
follow
your
argument
all
except
the
vital
key
in
it
and
that
is
why
does
he
reject
all
bids.
justice
potter
stewart
he
gets
--
he
gets
a
bid
higher
than
the
national,
whatever
it
is,
national
average
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
--
and
favorable
in
terms
of
--
of
date
and
everything
else,
why
does
he
reject
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
bidding
though,
that
what
be
negotiations.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
still
don't
understand
why
if
the
bid
had
been
satisfactory
to
the
producer
of
the
bid,
viking's
bid
would
not
have
been
accepted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
goldman
won't
bid,
you
told
us
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
if
goldman
had
bid
then
it
offered
the
same
terms
that
under
your
case
he
later
bid
by
negotiation
and
viking
also
would
have
been
refused.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
distributor's
interest
is
in
getting
the
highest
price
and
the
best
conditions
with
the
exhibition
of
his
product,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
are
you
suggesting
it
wasn't
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
how
about
in
dollars?
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
how
about
in
dollars
for
--
what
they
paid
for
film
rental?
because
so
far,
your
figures
may
simply
in
--
indicate
that
the
plaintiff
was
an
inexperienced
in
an
efficient
business.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
so
far,
i've
asked
you
a
question.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
in
dollar?
how
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
the
figure
in
dollars
as
to
what
they
paid?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
okay
if
you
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
specifically
question
the
court
of
appeals'
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
get
15
pictures,
the
fox
pictures
over
the
period
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
got
8
which
would
be
considerably
higher
than
the
--
than
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
what
stage
would
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
first
be
a
bidding?
justice
potter
stewart
they
never
bid.
i
see.
