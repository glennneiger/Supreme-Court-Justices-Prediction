justice
potter
stewart
had
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
only
place
where
--
where
it
deals
with
customers?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
liquor
there,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
arrivals
building.
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably,
there
are
no
customers
there,
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
but
this
isn't
for
coming
--
for
arriving
customers,
this
is
for
departing
customers.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
have
the
impression
from
the
record
that
the
arrivals
building
office
was
where
the
liquor
was
stored.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
place
is
where
they
deal
with
the
customers
are
in
the
twa
building,
the
pan
am
building
and
since
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
record
in
this
case
disclose
to
the
east
side
terminal.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
they're
in
inappropriate
place
for
the
nature
their
business.
justice
potter
stewart
the
department
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
case
of
rosenblum
against
frankel
in
the
appellate
division?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
truly
not
for
us
to
decide,
i
suppose
your
position
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
case
the
way
it's
been
--
being
argued
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
new
york
statute
does,
by
its
terms,
apply
to
this
operation.
and
so
the
issue
here
is
whether
it
can
constitutionally
do
so,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
hadn't
been
that
question,
they
couldn't
have
a
three-judge
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
this
case
all
about.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
in
the
record,
mr.
tuttle?
what
--
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
issue
for
us
to
decide
mr.
tuttle?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
too
but
you,
what
do
you
think,
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
the
point
and
it's
--
it's
for
the
courts
of
new
york
rather
than
for
this
court
to
say
what
the
new
york
statute
means,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
three-judge
court
had
never
held
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
i
mean
that
a
--
no
three-judge
district
court
had
ever
abstained.
and
what
this
court
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
that
the
individual
district
judge
shouldn't
do
that.
he
should
convene
a
three-judge
court
and
then
let
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
let
that
statutory
court
decide
whether
or
not
to
abstain.
