the
court
would
seem
to
be
very
clear
that
this
new
york
statute
did
not
reach
this
operation
at
all.
it
all
but
held
that
as
i
read
its
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
statute
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it's
never
been
construed
by
your
courts,
i
take
it
by
the
new
york
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
not
under
--
in
relation
to
this
enterprise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you
--
excuse
me.
suppose
--
neither
of
you
want
us
to
construe
the
new
york
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
difficulty
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
my
difficulty
is
you're
asking
us
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
on
the
premise.
if
the
new
york
statute
does
cover
this
in
the
lower
court
and
the
strongest
kind
of
term
has
indicated
that
if
it
had
to
decide
the
question,
it
doesn't
think
of
new
york.
it's
a
kind
of
hypothetical
question.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
new
york
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
new
york
could
pass
a
statute
making
it
illegal
for
this
enterprise
or
enterprise
of
this
kind
engage
solely
in
foreign
commerce?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
really
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
really
what
this
case
comes
down
to,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
you
don't
want
to
regulate,
you
want
to
prohibit
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
it
comes
down
to
is
saying
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
repeals
the
commerce
clause
so
far
as
liquor
is
concern?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
why
don't
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
was
--
suppose
--
supposing
the
--
supposing
what
it
--
was
done
here
had
been
done
by
the
federal
government
by
making
the
collector
of
customs,
federal
collector
of
customs
a
purveyor
of
this
liquor,
could
new
york
stop
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
--
leave
out
bon
voyage
entirely
and
as
the
federal
government
just
says,
"we'll
have
our
local
collector
of
customs
to
furnish
this
--
this
facility
to
overseas
passengers."
could
new
york
stop
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
am
suggesting
is
what
your
argument
ultimately
leads
to
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
repeals
the
commerce
clause
so
far
as
liquor
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
concern.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i'm
leaving
out
the
reservation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
the
enclave,
then
you
will
be
out
of
this
one.
