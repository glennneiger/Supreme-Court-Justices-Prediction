mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
defendants,
the
chairman
and
members
of
the
state
liquor
authority
in
the
state
of
new
york
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
judgment
from
which
the
appeal
is
taken
had
among
other
things
declared
that
the
application
to
appellee's
resale
liquor
operations
of
the
licensing
--
liquor
licensing
requirements
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law
impinged
upon
and
were
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
constitution
and
the
court
below
also
issued
an
injunction
permanently
prohibiting
the
state
liquor
authority
from
interfering
in
anywise
with
the
resale
operations
conducted
by
appellee.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
my
understanding,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
galt
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
first,
i
should
say
that
i'm
going
in
the
interest
of
saving
time
since
this
is
on
a
summary
calendar
to
skip
the
procedural
steps
which
resulted
in
this
case
once
before
having
come
before
this
court.
i
think
it's
unnecessary
to
any
of
the
substantive
issues
now
presented
to
discuss
that
in
anywise.
but
what
is
ultimately
at
stake
in
this
litigation
is
no
less
than
the
right
of
the
states
to
license
and
regulation,
the
distribution
and
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors.
and
i
think
i
need
hardly
remind
this
court
that
by
now,
in
the
year
1964,
there
was
no
question
whatever
of
the
unique
and
special
status
of
liquors.
now,
constitutionally
and
from
the
whole
history
of
legislative
and
judicial
decision
and
development,
it's
quite
clear
that
liquor
is
in
a
class
by
itself
and
not
to
be
treated
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
or
otherwise
in
the
same
category
as
such
ordinary
commodities
as
oil,
milk
and
anything
else
that
one
might
think
of.
and
more
specifically,
the
question
here
is
whether
the
state
of
new
york
may
constitutionally
apply
its
liquor
licensing
requirements
to
the
appellee's
resale
liquor
operations.
and
very
briefly,
i'd
like
to
summarize
what
those
operations
are.
the
plaintiff
--
the
appellee
is
a
new
york
corporation
which
maintains
its
office
and
principal
place
of
business
at
what
was
known
as
the
idlewild
and
is
now
the
kennedy
international
airport.
it
maintained
its
private
office
or
shop
--
its
principal
shop
on
the
second
floor
of
the
arrival's
building
at
the
airport.
it
also
has
and
that
the
start
of
this
litigation
had
selling
counters
at
the
pan
american
and
twa
counters
within
the
airport.
but
now
--
mr.
irving
galt
pardon.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
not
now.
since
the
litigation
started,
and
we've
referred
to
this
in
our
briefs
and
i'm
sure
that
counsel
will
not
again
say
the
accuracy
of
my
statement.
since
then,
they
have
already
opened
to
our
knowledge
at
least
one
place
in
the
east
side
airlines
terminal.
that's
over
in
the
borough
of
manhattan.
and
that's
a
place
from
which
conveyances
can
bring
passengers
to
the
airport.
and
that's
very
important,
mr.
justice
stewart
if
i
may
say
so
because
this
is
not
on
federal
territory,
even
that
portion
which
is
in
the
airport
is
not
on
federally
ceded
territory,
but
even
more
important,
since
the
appellee
suggests
that
it
had
some
sort
of
federal
license
or
federal
authorization
from
the
customs
department,
from
the
customs
people.
this
is
a
very
strange
thing.
the
opening
of
this
new
sales
outlet
at
the
east
side
airlines
terminal
points
to
the
fact
that
if
they're
correct
in
their
contention,
what
is
to
stop
this
plaintiff
alone
from
opening
outlets
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
absolutely
unregulated,
unsupervised,
unlicensed
and
untouchable
by
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
--
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
liquor
at
--
at
either
the
two
counters
or
at
the
--
at
the
sales
place,
the
sales
counter
are
now
on
the
east
side
airline
terminal.
there
is,
however,
liquor
stored
at
the
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
at
the
arrivals
building
at
its
principal
office.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
customers
come
in
there.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
also
the
arrival
building.
mr.
irving
galt
so
far
as
we
know,
and
i
believe
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
i
believe
that
the
principle
place
of
selling
is
at
the
arrivals
building.
that's
their
main
office.
mr.
irving
galt
well
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
think
--
i
think
the
whole
business
is
entirely
inappropriate
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
illegal
and
whatever
place
it
would
be
conducted
at
would
be
equally
inappropriate.
however,
it's
--
it's
especially
inappropriate,
i
should
think,
when
this
is
an
arrivals
building.
however,
this
does
not
inhibit
them
in
the
slightest
from
doing
what
has
already
at
the
date
of
the
trial
proved
to
be
a
substantial
business.
now
--
mr.
irving
galt
who
operates
the
warehouse?
the
plaintiff
itself.
and
i
do
not
concede
that
it
is
a
warehouse
but
on
the
contrary,
it
is
not
a
warehouse
at
all.
one
of
the
points
we
will
make
is
that
this
sort
of
three
wheeling
operation
has
an
informality
which
is
to
me,
astounding.
this
is
not,
under
any
known
federal
regulation,
under
any
known
federal
formula
or
any
known
state
statute
for
that
matter
or
warehouse
which
--
which
complies
with
any
definitions
or
any
requirements
of
that
sort.
this
plaintiff
purchases
its
supplies
from
wholesalers
located
in
philadelphia,
washington,
and
i
believe
baltimore,
and
it
has
these
liquors
shipped
by
the
case
from
across
state
lines
to
its
proprietary
place,
private
proprietary
place
here
in
new
york.
and
it's
an
unbonded
operation.
the
plaintiff,
admittedly,
at
the
trial,
carries
no
bond
of
any
kind
whatever.
and
these
liquors
are
sent
to
it
and
are
stored
by
the
case.
however,
they
are
sold
by
the
bottle.
complaint
had
said,
"one
bottle
per
passenger".
it
developed
at
the
trial
that
the
--
the
sales
were
up
to
two
bottles
per
passenger.
mr.
irving
galt
certainly.
mr.
irving
galt
wholesaler.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
now,
mr.
tuttle
is
shaking
his
head.
this
was
a
point
of
violent
disagreement
between
us
at
the
trial.
i
say
absolutely
unbonded.
this
plaintiff
neither
by
any
principle
of
law,
which
i
can
find
nor
by
any
statute,
in
fact,
contrary
to
the
statute
itself
carries
no
bond.
there
is
no
bond
such
as
required
by
1557
(b),
i
think
it's
title
xx
--
title
xix,
known
as
557
(b)
when
a
withdrawal
is
made
from
a
storage
warehouse,
when
a
withdrawal
of
liquor
is
made
to
someone
else
who
was
not
the
exporter
or
the
importer
when
the
transaction
is
not
directly
by
the
party
at
the
warehouse,
a
bond
--
new
bond
is
supposed
to
be
filed,
no
such
bond.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
plaintiff.
mr.
irving
galt
correct.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
that
is
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
mr.
tuttle
will
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
pardon.
mr.
irving
galt
to
--
no.
what
they
do
is
they
deliver
them
to
the
departing
airplanes.
they
--
the
plaintiff
delivers
this
after
a
sale
is
made,
customers
come
in.
departing
airline
passengers
and
i
add
the
word
"presumably"
because
it
would
be
easy
for
me
or
anyone
to
pose
as
a
departing
airline
passenger,
but
departing
airline
passengers
come
into
their
place
of
business,
identify
themselves
as
such
in
some
way.
and
then
the
liquor
is
sent
to
the
plane
from
which
they
are
to
depart
and
presumably
not
delivered
until
the
passenger
reaches
his
destination
overseas.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
very
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
clear
and
emphatic.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
i
must
say
to
your
honor,
first
of
all,
we
haven't
had
the
--
haven't
had
any
investigation
made
of
overseas
planes,
trips
and
anyway.
we
have
been
under
a
stay
both
successive
formal
stays
and
informally
accepted
stays
which
have
prevented
us
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
from
in
anywise
in
investigating
or
conducting
any
activities
with
respect
to
their
operations.
but
i
point
to
the
fact
that
this
court
itself
has
said
many
times,
it
has
noted
many
times,
the
tendency
of
liquor
to
get
out
of
bounds,
language
used
in
cases
like
duckworth
and
the
like.
but
i
think
it's
clear
here
that
many
things
could
and
might
be
done
under
an
operation
of
this
sort.
and
this
is
what
we
not
only
very
strongly
suggested
below
but
what
we
certainly
suggest
here.
however,
we
don't
rest
on
diversion.
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
this
liquor
is
stored
sometimes
for
30
days
or
more
by
acknowledgment
of
the
plaintiff's
precedent
at
the
trial.
he
was
admitted
that
for
a
period
of
30
days
and
more,
this
liquor
is
stored
at
the
plaintiff's
private
premises
before
being
resold
to
departing
airline
passengers.
now,
it
seemed
perfectly
clear
to
me,
the
new
york
statute
is
printed
in
the
appendix
at
pages
42
and
43
of
our
brief.
first,
that
this
plaintiff,
beyond
question,
is
purchasing
from
wholesalers,
causing
the
liquors
to
be
delivered
to
them
in
the
state
of
new
york
across
state
lines,
keeping
the
liquors,
storing
the
liquors,
soliciting
sales
in
new
york
and
selling
in
new
york.
all
of
that
is
plainly
selling
within
the
clear
and
explicit
language
of
section
3,
subdivision
28
of
our
new
york
alcoholic
beverage
control
law.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
court
below,
i
--
i
must
say
this,
the
court
below
took
the
last
phrase
of
the
statute,
which
is
printed
at
page
42
of
our
brief,
and
shall
include
the
delivery
of
any
alcoholic
beverage
in
the
state.
as
though
it
read,
i
must
include
the
delivery
of
any
alcoholic
beverage
in
the
state.
now
actually,
there
is
delivery
to
begin
with.
it's
delivered
from
the
wholesalers
to
these
people.
that's
the
first
point.
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
--
this
is
a
very
broad
statutory
definition.
new
york
is
protecting
itself
in
the
trafficking
in
liquors.
and
therefore,
it's
very
clear
that
this
was
not
meant
to
limit
the
statutory
definition
and
to
so
narrow,
the
ordinary
concept
of
selling
as
to
require
in
every
instance
for
a
sale
delivery
ultimately
to
be
made
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
galt
this
was
the
broaden
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
subdivision
28
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
i'm
sure
it
has
been
on
this
particular
--
mr.
irving
galt
no.
but
i
will
say,
i
will
say
that
there's
a
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
red
hook
case
in
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
case
which
i
argued
some
years
ago,
which
will
show
very
clearly
that
the
new
york
courts
undoubtedly
would
construe
this
and
i
say
this
was
all
due
deference
to
the
court
below,
undoubtedly
would
have
construed
this
operation
is
coming
within
the
sales
definition.
more
important,
mr.
justice
harlan,
note
--
at
no
time
in
the
initial
stages
of
this
litigation
and
during
and
through
the
trial
that
the
plaintiff
suggests
that
it
wasn't
within
the
definition.
what
plaintiff's
suggestion
is
and
was
or
was
at
that
time,
they
may
have
changed
it
by
now.
but
throughout
the
trial,
and
after
they're
going
up
to
this
court
and
then
the
trial
which
followed,
throughout
the
trial,
their
position
was
that
this
was
--
this
application
of
new
york's
laws
to
its
operations
where
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
constitution.
and
it's
only
now
possibly
with
the
--
if
it
is
in
suggestion
from
the
opinion
below
that
counsel
now
elaborates
have
been
on
the
same
sort
of
ideas
and
your
honors
suggest.
but
i
think
it's
very
clear
and
i
don't
doubt
for
a
moment
that
--
that
the
court
will
so
find
it
that
the
new
york
statute
amply
covers,
clearly
and
explicitly
covers
the
appellee's
operation.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
that
was
the
one
i
think
which
followed
during
against
--
during
against
valente
and
there,
i
can
only
say
of
that
case
this.
that's
not
new
york's
highest
court
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
but
it
is
a
pronouncement,
a
broad
pronouncement
as
to
not
dealing
an
international
transaction.
mr.
irving
galt
it
must
be
remembered
that
rosenblum
followed
the
during
case,
during
against
valente.
during
against
valente
was
--
would
concerns
solely
with
the
single
free
trades
on
that
new
york
has,
the
one
in
staten
island.
and
that
whole
case
was
postulated
and
premised
on
that
concept
of
the
exclusivity
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
a
free
trade
zone.
and
when
in
--
in
franklin
--
rosenblum
rather
against
frankel,
the
court
delivered
that
rather
strange
suggestion.
it
was
done
on
the
basis
of
the
during
case
which
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
such
proposition.
i
don't
think
that
that
case,
by
any
manner
of
any
means,
in
anywise
determine
--
is
determinative
of
this
issue,
very
clearly,
i
think
under
any
approach
to
this
case.
they
are
within
the
--
the
physical
functional
requirements
for
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
irving
galt
well,
now,
if
there
are
any
questions
of
--
of
state
interpretations,
and
we
wanted
to
wear
it
include
the
trial
that
there
would
be,
then
we
would
say
we
have
a
defense
of
equitable
abstention
here.
we
were
allowed
to
use
that
defense.
we
are
allowed
to
use
it.
we
feel
that
this
court
need
not
be
impeded
by
any
such
situations
as
your
honor
has
just
suggested
that
they
are
not
truly
dispositive
of
it.
but
if
it
were
a
case
of
new
york
construction,
i
should
very
much
like
the
opportunity
of
going
before
the
new
york
courts
for
that
construction.
we
had
not
thought
it
necessary.
we're
anxious
to
dispose
of
this.
we
feel
this
solicit
operation
is
going
on
check
something
like
three
or
three
and
a
half
years
now.
and
we
feel
that
the
--
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
indeed
throughout
the
states
of
the
country
require
that
this
kind
of
operation
be
stop
in
its
tracks.
mr.
irving
galt
this
is
our
hypothesis
and
more
than
that,
we
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
so
clear.
the
principle
is
so
obviously
applicable
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
they
covered
the
operation.
the
question,
as
your
honors
suggest,
is
the
constitutional
question
which
originally
these
people
raised
in
coming
in
for
declaratory
judgment
and
adjunctive
relief.
mr.
irving
galt
that
is
correct.
there
would
have
been
no
substantial
federal
question
and
i
assume
that
that's
what
this
decided
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
was
this
court
held,
although
i
did
not
argue
it
here
on
that
prior
occasion.
mr.
irving
galt
i
can't
speak
for
mr.
tuttle.
mr.
tuttle
has
very
strong
views
of
his
own
and
i
speak
only
for
myself.
i
would
assume
that
that
should
be
mr.
tuttle's
view
but
i
--
i
would
rather
leave
that
to
mr.
tuttle
himself.
mr.
irving
galt
he
has
three
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
galt
well,
the
lower
court
just
expressed
certain
doubts
based
on
--
on
its
own
reading,
or
if
i
may
differentially
and
i
think
more
accurately
say
so,
misreading
of
that
language
which
i
mentioned
before.
they
did
not
go
so
far
as
do
anything
more
than
expressed
opinions
on
that
one.
they
were
starting
to
talk
about
equitable
abstention.
however,
if
there'd
be
any
question
of
new
york
interpretation,
and
i
think
there
is
none,
i
think
these
operations
are
very
clearly
within
the
new
york
statute,
then
i
would
say
this
case
could
not
have
been
tried
by
a
three-judge
court
and
must
first
go
to
trial
before
the
new
york
courts
on
the
question
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
irving
galt
no,
they
could
not
have
for
the
reason
first,
that
their
premises
were
not
located
in
the
place
which
would
have
been
licensable
under
the
existing
state
of
law.
and
moreover,
under
the
--
under
the
situation
which
existed
in
new
york
under
rule
17
and
section
17
of
the
abc
law
which
have
been
construed
by
the
new
york
courts,
they
--
there
were
no
licenses,
no
resale
licenses
or
retail
licenses
being
issued.
so
they
would
not
have
received
a
--
a
license.
mr.
irving
galt
if
they
complied
with
new
york
requirements,
they
--
they
possibly
could
receive
them.
mr.
irving
galt
they
are
located
on
the
second
floor
of
a
building.
that
premises
must
be
retail
--
liquor
licenses
must
be
for
stores
on
street
level,
among
other
things.so
physically,
they
did
not
meet
the
requirements.
now,
the
contention
here
is
--
is
as
to
the
supremacy
and
commerce
clauses
and
for
the
wedge
in
that
respect.
the
plaintiffs
attempt
to
use
section
311
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930.
now,
your
honors
know
that's
simply
a
tax
exemption
statute.
and
even
assuming
these
plaintiffs
could
comply
with
it,
it
would
have
absolutely
no
bearing
insofar
as
giving
any
affirmative
right
on
the
federal
law.
and
we've
had
this
question
in
the
case
that's
cited
here,
the
american
travelers
club,
a
different
three-judge
statutory
court
in
the
same
southern
district.
we've
cited
it
in
the
briefs.
now,
i
think
that
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
court
below
certainly
overlooked
the
unique
constitutional
status
of
liquors
on
the
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
under
such
acts
as
the
wilson,
webb-kenyon,
federal
alcoholic
administration
act
and
the
like.
those
--
those
statues,
time
doesn't
permit
it,
but
there
at
page
34
of
our
brief,
even
if
we
didn't
have
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
would
think
both
from
the
judicial
history
of
interpretation
of
those
statutes
and
from
the
language
of
the
statutes
themselves
that
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
this
operation
could
be
set
up
as
it
has
been
in
new
york
and
with
the
twenty-first
amendment.
of
course,
the
twenty-first
amendment
absolutely
prohibits
any
operations
in
violation
of
state
law
where
there
is
use
for
delivery
of
liquor
within
the
state.
now,
there
are
undoubtedly
has
been,
if
we
need
to
go
so
far
as
the
twenty-first
amendment.
unquestionably,
there
is
use
in
the
state
of
new
york.
first,
there's
delivery,
the
liquors
were
delivered
to
them
in
the
state
of
new
york,
sold
to
them
as
the
sale
to
them
first
from
the
wholesalers.
then
there
is
use
--
they're
stored
in
new
york,
there
is
solicitation,
there
were
sales.
if
this
be
not
use,
then
i
don't
know
what
this
clear
and
explicit
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
could
possibly
refer
to.
now,
there
are
many
supreme
court
cases
and
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
it
hold
that
under
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
state
power
cannot,
when
it
comes
to
liquor
traffic,
be
limited
by
the
commerce
clause.
and
there
are
many
cases
to
that
effect
beginning
with
the
state
board
against
young's
case
in
1936.
not
long
after
the
amendment,
a
series
of
cases
came
into
this
court.
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
construed
and
construed
no
uncertain
terms.
and
it
--
there
were
cases
later
on
after
these
series
of
cases
that
we've
mentioned
state
boards,
ziffrin,
mahoney
and
the
like.
there
were
cases
such
as
duckworth
and
carter
which
involve
simply
transportation
through
a
state
where
this
court
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
reach
the
twenty-first
amendment.
although
some
concurring
justices,
like
mr.
justice
jackson
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
thought
that
the
twenty-first
should
been
--
should
have
been
reached.
but
i
should
think
that
if
there
was
any
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
situations
of
the
kind
we
have
at
bar,
they
certainly
will
lay
finally
to
rest
by
this
court's
1958
decisions
in
california
against
washington
and
even
more
appropriate,
gordon
against
texas.
it's
true
those
were
first,
two
or
three
line
per
curiam
opinions
but
they
were
--
they
cited
the
twenty-first
amendment
very
significantly
and
they
allowed
that
none
of
their
force
by
the
fact
that
they
were
short
per
curiam
opinions.
i
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
but
the
important
and
decisive
thing,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
they
cited,
under
those
state
of
facts,
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
i
would
say
that
if
need
be,
if
we
were
deprived
of
the
twenty-first
amendment's
applicability
in
this
case,
most
assuredly,
the
other
factors
--
federal
statutes
that
we've
mentioned,
that
we
have
to
show
reasonableness
of
the
regulation,
it
would
be
very
easy
to
show
it
although
it's
impossible
in
the
one
or
two
minutes
i
think
i
have
left.
mr.
irving
galt
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
continue
only
for
a
minute
or
two
because
i
want
to
reserve
five
minutes.
i
simply
want
to
say
first
that
with
reference
to
gordon
against
texas
and
its
citation
both
of
carter
and
the
twenty-first
amendment,
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
this
indicates
not
only
that
this
court
is
ready
to
invoke
the
twenty-first
amendment.
but
that
even
in
situations
of
this
kind,
even
where
a
test
of
reasonableness
might
be
imposed
such
as
in
carter,
this
court
will
also
dispose
of
the
issue
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
regulation
under
the
circumstances.
but
what
i
want
most
to
emphasize
is
that
there
is
here
at
this
late
date
an
issue
of
state
power.
now,
i
should
have
thought
that
this
issue
of
state
power
was
disposed
of
and
removed
after
cases
like
young's
market,
mahoney
against
triner
and
ziffrin.
and
there
are
today,
at
this
late
date,
nevertheless,
attempts
not
only
in
this
case
but
you
will
find
in
texas,
in
california,
elsewhere
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
probably
elsewhere
in
the
nation
that
they
are
all
looking
through
this
case
to
see
whether
this
court
will
permit
the
erosion
of
state
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
irving
galt
i
share
mr.
tuttle's
dilemma
in
my
own
recurring
dilemma
of
much
affirmative
to
say
and
no
time
left
within
which
to
say
it
but
i
want
to
comment
on
a
few
of
mr.
tuttle's
suggestions.
first
of
all,
picking
up
mr.
justice
white's
last
suggestion,
suppose
new
york
state
were
a
dry
state?
the
question,
i
--
i
meant
question.
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
it
improperly.
the
--
i
suppose
new
york
state
were
a
dry
state,
is
it
conceivable
that
this
kind
of
operation
could
exist
selling
liquor
to
people
liquor
which
is
stored
within
the
state?
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious.
mr.
irving
galt
that
--
mr.
irving
galt
absolutely
it
could
do
it
but
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
using
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
language
in
that
concurring
opinion
on
the
frankfort
case
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
they
can
have
a
high
barrier,
low
barrier,
no
barrier
at
all
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
and
an
insuperable
barrier.
mr.
irving
galt
in
a
sense,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
i
was
going
to
say
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
it
isn't
a
question
of
not
wanting
to
regulate
or
not
wanting
to
prohibit.
these
are
cast
in
terms
which
suit
the
plaintiff's
side
of
the
case
but
it
works
this
way
i
should
say.
it
did
--
much
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that
it
is
licensable.
well,
no
new
york
retail
license
--
no
new
york
retail
would
be
operator
is
licensable
at
the
moment
but
there
are
suggestions
that
new
york
at
any
moment.
in
fact,
the
new
york
times
has
been
indicating
what
the
state
liquor
authorities'
views
are.
retail
licenses
will
be
opened
up
again.
his
position
is
actually
no
different
than
that
of
any
other
retail
licensee
and
that
purport
what
mr.
tuttle
suggested
about
--
mr.
irving
galt
he
--
he
sells
in
foreign
commerce
--
mr.
irving
galt
no.
but
he
--
but
that
isn't
true
i
think,
a
true
definition
of
their
activities.
they
sell
right
in
the
state
of
new
york.
this
is
not
export.
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinions
in
those
cases
in
which
he
describes
exports
as
being
immediate
transactions.
this
--
this
delayed
reaction
--
mr.
irving
galt
the
delivery
to
the
customer
actually
constructively
is
delivered
to
him
on
the
plane.
he
makes
his
purchase
and
he
--
and
he
gets
tired,
"i'll
do
it
right
here
in
new
york."
but
by
this
gimmick
of
delivering
it
over
in
europe,
the
transaction
suddenly
takes
on
a
different
nature.
it
renders
it
nonetheless,
i
say
to
you
mr.
justice
white
a
sale,
a
clear
and
explicit
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
right.
mr.
irving
galt
it
can
--
it
can
certainly
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
it
is
our
position
that
if
they
want
the
one
to
the
commerce
clause,
they
can
prevent
--
they
can
prevent
this
type
of
operation.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
i
--
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
that
the
twenty-first
--
mr.
irving
galt
i'd
--
i
say
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
made
sure
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
traffic
in
liquor
is
paramount
to
that
of
the
federal
government
but
that
where
the
state
does
not
act.
and
to
the
extent
that
a
state
does
not
act,
there
is
no
question
that
--
that
congress
does
have
the
right
to
have
export
and
import
operations
in
commerce
in
liquors.
nobody
argues
to
the
contrary.
but
the
point
is
that
the
commerce
clause
is
subordinate
to
and
only
supplementary
to
the
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
traffic
and
intoxicants.
and
that's
clearly
spelled
out
in
your
honor's
own
decision.
mr.
irving
galt
make
the
federal
collector
--
mr.
irving
galt
i
would
think
so
in
view
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
would
be
traffic.
mr.
irving
galt
subordinate
--
mr.
irving
galt
all
that
the
federal
people
have
to
do
is
set
up
a
reservation
as
they
did
in
the
yellow
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
yellow
summit.
mr.
irving
galt
of
course.
but
--
but
those
things
only
emphasize
the
point
that
which
your
honor
is
now
driving
because,
where
you
have
and
you
do
have
federal
reservations,
we
have
a
federal
free
trade
zone
in
new
york
state
in
staten
island.
that
was
the
subject
of
the
during
case.
precisely,
the
point
there,
we
--
we
can
do
nothing,
the
state
can
control
it.
so
i
--
the
federal
government
can
control
it.
so
i
say
that
the
commerce
clause
is
not
actually
repealed.
i
think
that
language
is
a
fit
if
i
may
say
so,
too
strong.
but
certainly,
the
commerce
clause
is
clearly
subordinated
and
the
suggestion
as
--
as
to
the
--
the
reference
to
the
policy
of
new
york
temperance
in
hawaii,
these
overlooks
a
whole
host
of
things.
there
are
all
this
economic
incidents
that
we
stress
in
our
brief.
this
situation
of
having
an
operation
or
resale
operation
in
new
york,
they
buy
liquor.
it's
delivered
to
them
in
new
york
and
then
they
resell
it
to
other
people
and
it
can
take
substantial
periods
of
time
before
a
bottle
of
liquor
is
sold.
all
of
these
which
can
be
done
by
new
york
retail
licensees,
perhaps
other
licensees
under
the
liquor
law
all
of
these
without
the
onerous
requirements
that
are
imposed
on
new
york
liquor
licensees
without
the
minimum
resale
price
regulations,
without
the
other
restrictions,
without
the
supervision
through
books
and
records.
and
new
york's
statute
only
goes
to
a
supervision
through
licensing.
this
is
the
key
to
supervision.
as
far
as
terminating
that
business,
i
refer
your
honors
to
cases
like
mahoney
against
triner
and
all
the
way
back
to
the
last
century
in
the
mugler
case
and
there
wasn't
the
slightest
doubt,
i'm
--
i'm
certain
there's
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
there
is
such
a
conflict
and
if
it's
within
the
domain
and
power
of
the
state,
the
state
can
and
need
be
terminate.
it
can
and
it
does
do
that
and
its
authority
has
been
recognized
to
do
that
and
this
situation
is
no
different.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
this
is
no
different
--
mr.
irving
galt
there
is
no
federal
enclave
here
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
irving
galt
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
follow
your
honor
--
i
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
i
see
no
difference.
the
--
the
point
is
that
in
new
--
mr.
irving
galt
no.
absolutely
not
in
the
lower
court
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion
as
you
will
see,
specifically
recognized
that
there
was
no
question
at
all
but
that
this
is
not
a
federal
reservation
or
enclave
of
any
sort.
this
is
precisely
the
same
as
though
the
operation
were
conducted
in
the
middle
of
the
state,
the
middle
of
the
city
or
any
part
of
new
york
state.
this
is
no
free
zone,
no
federal
enclave,
nothing
of
that
sort.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
exactly
the
point.
i
--
that
was
the
reference
i
made
when
i
said
they
were
extending
their
sales
offices
now.
why
could
not
this
--
it
is
not
the
united
states
customs
division
or
department
to
which
has
been
entrusted
the
task
of
regulating
and
supervising
the
distribution
of
sale
of
liquor
in
the
state
of
new
york
without
criticizing
that
agency.
i
say
it's
for
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
other
states,
for
those
states
to
regulate
and
supervise
liquor
traffic
and
in
traffic
and
intoxicants
in
those
states.
and
here,
we
have
precisely
the
opposite.
i
--
why
--
were
not
arguing
as
far
as
section
3
(11)
is
concern
which
is
only
an
exemption
statute
anyway.
we
have
at
pages
27
and
the
following
of
our
brief
showed
that
this
does
not
apply
anyway.
in
fact,
these
plaintiffs
don't
even
comply
with
section
3
(11)
as
your
honors
will
see
with
the
argument
beginning
at
page
27
of
our
brief.
now,
as
far
as
customs
supervision
is
concern,
it's
only
a
paper
supervision.
it
is
not
--
there
are
no
customs
personnel
and
the
record
shows
that
as
signed
to
the
plaintiff's
premises
when
the
liquors
are
brought
in,
when
the
liquors
are
delivered
to
the
plane,
when
they're
on
the
plane.
now,
i
took
the
position
and
your
honors
can
see
it
at
page
80
--
mr.
irving
galt
no,
except
this.
the
thought
of
diversion
which
was
raised
by
mr.
tuttle,
he
made
quite
a
point
of
the
opportunity
for
diversion.
actually,
your
honors
will
see
from
the
record
that
my
position
was
that
we
weren't
bound
to
offer
proof
of
diversion
but
i
know
that
there
is
rich
opportunity
for
diversion.
suppose
--
suppose
someone
comes
in
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
and
impersonate
the
passengers.
mr.
irving
galt
suppose
this
liquor
is
put
on
to
the
plane
and
take
them
right
off?
mr.
irving
galt
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
mr.
irving
galt
right.
maybe
i'm
getting
on
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
mr.
tuttle's
battlegrounds
for
that
and
maybe
i
had
no
business
stepping
in
on
it
by
i
merely
mentioned
it
because
he
raised
the
point.
mr.
irving
galt
oh
well
--
mr.
irving
galt
according
to
mr.
justice
black's
example,
it
would
be
sold
--
it
would
be
sold
to
any
departing
airline
passenger
from
the
middle
of
the
state.
it
makes
no
difference
physically
--
mr.
irving
galt
--
where
the
operations
--
mr.
irving
galt
it
might
--
mr.
irving
galt
so
might
this
be
sold
for
consumption
in
the
state?
the
possibility
exists.
mr.
irving
galt
no.
it
--
it
would
not
make
any
difference
except
that
it
makes
our
case
all
the
stronger.
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
yes.
except
that
this
case
is
much
the
stronger
because
of
this
added
feature.
mr.
irving
galt
because
the
possibility
of
diversion
if
we
--
if
we
had
to
go
--
for
instance
we
had
to
do
it
without
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
we
have
to
go,
assuming
if
the
test
of
reasonableness
could
be
applied
here.
this
would
make
the
test
of
reasonableness
all
the
easier
to
apply.
however,
our
argument
is
as
--
as
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
mr.
justice
white
that
with
the
twenty-first
amendment,
once
we
have
delivery
and
once
we
have
use
of
the
liquors,
for
whatever
reasons,
the
congress
has
made
it
paramount,
this
court's
decisions
have
made
it
paramount,
the
right
of
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
where
it
comes
into
play
must
be
recognized
if
need
be
as
making
the
commerce
clause
yield
to
the
extent
of
the
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
irving
galt
yes.
mr.
irving
galt
absolutely
--
mr.
irving
galt
yes,
new
york
can
be
an
absolutely
dry
or
semi-dry
state.
it
could
be
a
monopoly
state
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
you
can
have
defense
any
way
you
want
it.
mr.
irving
galt
it's
superable.
mr.
irving
galt
that's
--
that's
our
position.
