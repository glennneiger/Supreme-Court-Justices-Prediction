mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
--
in
epitome
get
the
facts
clearly
before
your
honors,
i'm
going
to
just
read
the
findings
made
by
the
liquor
authority
itself
in
submitting
the
question
to
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
opinion.
we
go
along
to
those
facts.
now
to
have
said
that
as
it's
been
said
here
a
moment
ago,
because
of
some
stays,
they
--
the
liquor
authority
was
barred
from
an
adequate
investigational
facts.
the
liquor
authority
has
been
over
our
place
time
and
time
and
time
again
at
all
our
records.
now,
the
liquor
authority
on
may
9th,
1960
submitted
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general
asking
for
his
opinion.
and
in
describing
the
facts,
they
referred
to
this
business
by
the
plaintiff
under
the
sanction
and
in
fact,
through
the
use
of
the
united
states
government,
treasury
department
said,
"traffic
in
alcoholic
beverages
having
a
situs
actually
or
constructively
without
the
state
are
not
intended
for
use
or
delivery
within
the
state."
that's
the
liquor
authority's
own
language
after
its
investigation
of
our
business.
now
then,
the
attorney
general
responded
to
that
on
june
30th,
1960
on
page
17
of
the
record.
he
said
the
facts
are
--
and
then
having
described
the
diameter
and
so
forth
of
our
premises
as
the
idlewild,
he
goes
on
to
say
a
portion
of
the
lease
premises,
the
premises
are
leased
from
the
by
state
agency,
the
new
york
port
authority
which
by
the
way
has
in
its
lease
which
is
part
of
the
record
a
provision
that
no
liquor
shall
be
sold
in
these
lease
premises
except
in-bond
liquor
for
export.
now
a
portion
of
--
says
the
attorney
general,
"a
portion
of
the
leased
space
will
be
use
for
storage
and
display
of
the
liquor
particularly
by
the
corporation
from
suppliers,
from
stock
held
by
the
suppliers
in-bond.
and
will
remain
under
bond
and
under
supervision
of
the
bureau
of
customs
at
all
times
until
delivery
to
the
airplane.
the
liquor
is
to
be
shipped
by
the
lessee
from
the
united
states
on
the
plane
on
which
the
passenger
departs
but
it's
not
to
be
delivered
to
the
passenger
until
he
reaches
his
foreign
destination."
shipments
is
to
be
--
shipment
is
to
be
made
on
documents
approved
for
export
by
the
federal
government.
the
united
states
bureau
of
customs
has
indicated
that
it
treats
this
transaction
as
an
export
within
the
meaning
of
section
311,
now
1311
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930.
now,
the
practical
issue
and
it
embodies
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
was
stated
by
the
court
below
in
a
single
sentence.
the
plaintiff
will
be
put
out
of
business
by
the
liquor
authority
unless
it
is
accessible
in
this
action.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
liquor
authority
is
trying
to
invoke
some
section
of
the
local
law
for
the
purpose
of
supervision
or
as
in
some
of
the
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
in
the
past
where
there
has
been
a
state
requirement
of
a
permit
in
order
to
let
the
state
know
who
is
doing
the
business.
those
have
been
deemed
reasonable.
but
here
as
they
claimed
throughout
the
brief
and
today
is
that
there
is
to
be
unconditional
elimination
not
only
because
of
the
plaintiff's
business
but
of
the
government's
sanction,
federal
government's
sanction
and
use
of
the
--
of
this
method
in
furtherance
of
its
policies
for
the
regulation
of
foreign
commerce
and
in
the
national
interest,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
now,
the
liquor
authority's
brief
opens
with
two
points,
their
points,
and
they're
asking
this
court
to
decide
it.
the
first
is
on
page
25
--
page
11
or
rather
of
their
--
of
the
appellant's
brief.
four
pages
are
devoted
to
arguing
before
this
court
that
appellee's
liquor
operations
are
clearly
encompassed
by
the
language
of
the
new
york's
alcoholic
beverage
control
law.
i
dispute
that
and
i've
always
dispute
it.
and
they
say
now
that
if
the
matter
is
to
be
considered
by
this
court,
they
want
to
fall
back
on
the
equitable
extension
--
abstention
doctrine.
notwithstanding
that
at
the
opening
of
their
case
in
the
court
below,
they
said
two
things,
first
that
we
wish
to
have
the
court
understand
that
we
withdraw
our
third
affirmative
defense,
which
is
the
defense
of
equitable
abstention.
they
asked
to
withdraw
that.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
i
--
i
had
it
on
a
page
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
i'll
find
it
your
honors.
it's
at
the
opening.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
decided
what
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
your
honors
will
find
that
at
page
68
of
the
record.
mr.
galt,
i
won't
read
it,
that's
his.
now
consequently,
we
have
the
government's
--
the
attorney
general's
case
resting
on
two
points,
success
for
both
of
which
is
essential
to
their
total
success.
the
first
is
that
to
use
their
language
of
their
heading,
that
the
local
law
clearly
encompasses
what
is
being
done
and
works
a
prohibition
on
it,
and
why?
the
words
are
directly
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
whose
opinion
i've
already
called
your
honors'
attention
in
which
he
says,
"as
the
predicate
for
his
own
conclusion
of
complete
elimination,
there
is
no
provision
for
a
license
for
this
type
of
transaction.
any
suggestion
that
may
have
come
here
that
somehow
really
we
can
get
a
license
is
mistaken."
here,
we
have
a
construction
by
the
attorney
general
as
the
basis
of
his
decision
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
local
law
for
this
type
of
transaction.
now
what
type
of
transaction
is
referred
to?
i've
already
read
it
from
the
liquor
authority's
letter
to
the
attorney
general
in
which
it
says
it's
in,
"alcoholic
beverages
having
a
situs
actually
or
constructively
without
the
state
and
not
intended
to
be
used
or
delivered
within
the
state."
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
the
authority's
letter
is
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
from
which
i
have
read
is
page
161
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
you'll
find
that
right
near
the
top
there.
first
full
paragraph
on
page
161.
now,
the
second
proposition
is
that
having
claimed
that
the
local
law
in
--
clearly
encompasses
this
business.
their
second
proposition
is,
and
i'll
read
it
from
their
own
language.
while
he
is
taken
from
their
former
brief
when
this
case
was
before
the
court,
the
same
language
is
reflected
in
their
present
brief
and
it's
this
broad
generalization,
regulation
of
the
liquor
traffic
in
the
state,
by
the
state
is
paramount
to
the
federal
government's
right
to
regulate
whether
under
the
constitutional
provisions
concerning
commerce,
exports
and
imports
and
supremacy
or
under
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
of
a
preemptive
character.
i'm
unable
to
find
any
case
in
this
court
or
in
any
other
court
that
has
any
such
broad
general
assertion
which
were
deprived
the
right
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
to
deal
with
foreign
commerce
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
above
all
to
make
reciprocal
arrangements
since
it
was
done
in
this
case
without
a
country.
now
following
to
this
--
matter
of
these
two
claims,
it
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
their
case.
at
the
opening,
they've
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
our
complaint
for
a
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
you'll
find
that
on
record
25.
and
then
they
embodied
the
same
claim
that
we
stated
no
claim
on
which
redress
could
be
given
in
their
second
offense,
64.
now,
the
time
when
this
case
was
before
this
court
previously,
that
was
a
question
which
was
raised
in
defense
of
the
actions
below
which
was
--
were
raised
here.
and
this
court
said
and
i
quote,
370
u.s,
"assuredly,
the
complaint
at
least
formally
alleges
that
basis
for
equitable
relief."
now,
the
fact
is,
that
the
basic
facts,
the
basic
facts
that
are
stated
in
our
complaint
in
which
induce
that
language
by
the
court,
this
court,
were
all
proven
at
the
trial.
now,
the
peculiarity
of
this
trial
was
that
the
liquor
authority
never
put
a
witness
on
the
stand,
never
introduced
an
exhibit,
and
never
disputed
the
authenticity
of
the
volume
of
forms
by
the
customs
bureau
which
we
put
in
evidence.
and
in
consequence,
the
findings
of
fact
below
rest
upon
undisputed
documentary
evidence
showing
unquestionably
that
this
is
the
action
of
the
u.s.
bureau
of
customs
established
under
the
authorization
of
the
treasury
department
for
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
interest
of
the
united
states
as
stated
in
the
title
of
the
tariff
act.
an
act
to
provide
revenue
to
regular
--
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
countries,
to
encourage
the
industries
of
the
united
states,
to
protect
american
labor,
and
for
other
purposes.
now,
this
in-bond
liquor
is
sold
tax-free
and
you
can
readily
see
the
relation
point
of
view
of
policy
to
those
objectives
stated
in
the
title
tax-free,
which
it
means
a
difference
--
a
differential
of
about
$3
a
bottle.
and
consequently,
there
is
encouragement
to
our
travelers
particularly
in
the
economy
class
to
purchase
one
or
two
bottles
tax-free,
but
in-bond
for
export
only.
now,
another
thing
that
is
striking,
it
is
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
court
below
that
in
all
of
these
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
business
conducted
in
effect
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
customs
itself
through
us
at
that
one
little
spot
in
the
arrivals
building
which
is
by
the
way
is
in
the
center
of
the
u.s.
customs
bureau
headquarters.
as
the
president
of
the
company
says,
"we
do
our
business
in
a
goldfish
bowl,
in
the
middle
of
a
police
station."
and
the
finding
of
fact
was
that
there
is
not
only
no
allegation
in
the
--
in
the
attorney
general's
answer
but
there
isn't
a
particle
of
evidence
that
in
the
four
years
that
this
operation
has
been
running,
even
a
single
bottle
ever
got
diverted
into
the
city
--
into
the
state
of
new
york,
ever
became
part
of
the
common
mass
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
all
moved
from
bonded
warehouse,
in-bond,
bonded
trucker
through
and
the
bonded
truckers
bill
of
consignment,
it
was
not
to
the
plaintiff.
i
can't
stop
to
show
or
call
your
attention
to
the
forms
but
the
long
series
are
all
exempt
in
evidence.
the
release
from
the
ware
--
bonded
warehouse
is
on
form
7512,
which
is
in
evidence
here,
and
it's
a
form
which
requires
that
the
liquor
be
consigned
to
the
collector
of
customs
at
this
--
to
the
actual
airport.
and
the
trucker
receives
a
form
which
require
--
he
is
in-bond
requires
him
to
transport
that
and
deliver
it
to
the
collector
of
customs.
now
consequently,
the
perspective
here
is
not
at
all
that
presented
to
your
honors
in
the
first
instance
here
today.
it
is
that
we
are
the
creature
as
it
were
which
is
being
used
by
the
united
states
government
because
somebody
has
to
sell
if
this
policy
is
operated
at
all.
we
are
the
creature.
now
of
course,
your
honors
will
recall
that
from
the
very
earliest
times,
mcculloch
against
maryland,
it
was
decided
that
where
the
congress
has
constitutional
power,
it
may
determine
the
means.
and
it
has
determined
the
means
as
presented
in
this
case.
now,
the
procedure
--
the
procedure
is
not
ours.
we
don't
lay
down
this
procedure.
and
mr.
galt
in
the
court
below
stated
the
fact
simply
and
straightly.
you'll
find
it
on
record
84,
they,
that
is
the
customs
bureau
set
up
this
procedure.
they
set
up
the
procedure.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
there
--
there
is
no
moment
possible.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
they
--
the
bureau
of
customs
are
--
they
check
everything
we
do.
we
are
required
on
a
form
as
soon
as
the
liquor
comes
in
to
this
space.
now,
let
me
emphasize
about
this
space.
it's
a
small
space.
it's
across
the
hall
from
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
customs.
he
opens
the
door,
he
looks
right
into
our
place.
before
we
got
there,
we
had
to
submit
to
the
bureau
of
customs
a
design
for
that
floor
and
for
the
petitions.
and
they
approved
it
and
they
have
approved
it
for
four
years.
bear
in
mind
--
and
please
sirs
that
whatever
letter
from
the
treasury
department
started
this
whole
situation,
they
have
been
approving
everything
we've
done
for
the
last
four
years.
and
furthermore,
i
--
i
ask
your
honors
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
liquor
authority
has
never
asked
the
treasury
department
--
i
mean
the
bureau
of
customs
or
the
treasury
department
to
change
their
regulations,
to
add
something.
they've
never
been
anywhere
near
them
and
they
have
never
established
that
we
have
violated
any
of
the
regulations
as
they
stand.
no
such
claim
was
made,
no
allegations.
they
have
never
shown
that
the
bureau
of
customs
itself
ever
claimed
that
we
have
not
faithfully
performed
the
assignment
that
was
given.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
it
--
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
i
don't
think
you
are.
the
question
is
what
is
meant
by
the
word
delivery.
we
have
--
i'm
emphasizing
the
space.
it's
called
a
customs
approved
space.
in
other
words,
it's
part
of
the
line
or
stream
of
export
where
the
liquor
comes
to
the
point
where
somebody
comes
forward
to
take
advantage
of
the
tax-free
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
the
bonded
trucker
your
honor
is
under
a
poll
which
you'll
find
there
and
if
he
is
to
deliver
it
to
the
collector
of
customs,
the
truck
comes
in
and
the
customs
people
are
all
around
the
place.
it's
brought
up
in
that
sense
to
ask
custom's
approved
space,
of
course
we
are
there.
now,
it's
put
in
the
back
of
--
of
this
room
screened
from
you
by
law.
and
all
that
we
can
put
out
in
front
is
some
dummy
bottles
so
that
the
customer
can
see
the
--
the
branch
that
are
available
but
he
doesn't
see
the
liquor.
now
then,
he
comes
to
the
window
and
he
presents
his
passage
ticket.
an
entry
is
made
on
our
customers'
required
records
that
we
have
received
an
order
for
two
bottles
we'll
say.
he
doesn't
get
it.
we
are
required
by
the
bureau
of
customs
to
put
that
in
a
sealed
carton.
and
that
sealed
carton
is
then
moved
over
to
the
pusher
on
the
plane.
nobody
gets
it,
nobody
has
it.
and
then,
the
pusher
has
to
sign
a
receipt
by
the
--
of
--
of
this
--
of
the
contents
they
sealed
to
--
to
be
delivered
to
the
passenger,
the
man
who
bought
it
only
when
that
man
is
on
the
ramp
in
a
foreign
country.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i
would
assume
immediately
that
the
bureau
of
customs
would
--
could
withdraw
its
cooperation
with
us
altogether.
i
had
--
i
would
assume
that.
furthermore,
a
violation
of
the
regulations
of
the
bureau
of
customs
is
--
isn't
something
of
a
federal
offense.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
that
would
--
that
was
--
that
would
be
a
violation
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
--
if
we
did
that.
now,
nobody
claims
that
we
ever
did
it.
now,
let
me
very
briefly
deal
with
the
very
first
point
that
they
asked
you
to
decide.
they
believe
that
the
local
statute
does
encompass
what
is
being
done
here.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
all
i
know
is
that
they
put
it
before
you
to
decide
--
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
i
think
this
that.
if
you
should
find
out
that
the
local
statute
does
not
encompass
this,
then
their
whole
argument
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
might
very
well
become
moot.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
all
that
was
before
--
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so,
before
the
court
on
its
previous
occasion
because
the
courts
have
held
there,
three
of
the
judges
at
the
district
court
and
i
had
held
that
the
matter
should
be
the
subject
of
equitable
abstention.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no,
the
three-judge
court
simply
said
they
found
that
they
have
no
jurisdiction
as
an
appellate
court.
they
were
not
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
no.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
well,
your
honors,
this
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention
is
certainly
a
discretionary
battle.
this
--
the
cause
of
this
litigation
by
my
client
has
been
tremendous
and
the
court
below
has
said
that
they
did
not
think
that
it
would
be
equitable
to
send
us
after
all
these
trudging
again
into
the
state
court.
now,
let's
look
at
what
has
--
what
is
the
state
statute.
is
there
any
color
for
this?
and
has
the
state
courts
not
themselves
spoken
about
it?
if
you'll
read
as
i
know
you
will,
the
statement
of
purpose
in
the
local
statute.
i
deal
with
aspects
of
it
in
my
first
point,
i
won't
--
it's
on
their
first
point.
they
say
it
is
necessary
to
regulate
and
control
the
manufacture
sale
and
distribution
within
the
state
of
alcoholic
beverages
for
the
purpose
of
fostering
and
promoting
temperance
in
their
consumption
and
respect
for
and
obedience
to
all.
now,
there
is
no
conceivable
relation
between
the
export
that
we
are
talking
of
here
and
their
consumption
in
the
state
of
new
york.
this
--
the
state
of
new
york
isn't
affected
in
the
slightest
adversely
by
what's
being
done.
their
argument
and
it
comes
down
to
this
as
a
huge
begging
of
the
question.
they
say
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
local
law
for
a
license.
ergo,
what
we're
doing
is
illegal.
they
overlooked
that
the
legislature
is
familiar
presumably
with
the
constitution
and
with
the
relation
of
the
nation
to
foreign
commerce
and
that
the
absence
of
a
provision
for
licensing
this,
doesn't
argue
that
the
legislature
intended
it
to
be
illegal.
but
on
the
contrary,
it
argues
for
the
proposition
that
the
legislature
never
attempted
to
touch
foreign
commerce
and
that's
exactly
what
the
courts
have
said
which
i'll
quote
in
a
moment
from
our
own
state.
but
then,
this
introductory
statement
of
purpose
goes
on
to
say
that
it
is
for
the
protection,
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
people
of
the
state.
and
it's
impossible
to
see
how
--
what
goes
to
europe
and
never
gets
into
the
state
can
have
anything
to
do
with
the
health
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
states.
now,
they
cite
a
section
which
says
this,
"no
person
shall
manufacture
for
sale
or
sell
in
wholesale
or
retail
any
alcoholic
beverage
within
the
state."
they
keep
overlooking
those
words,
"within
the
state."
in
other
words,
the
relation
of
the
liquor
must
be
to
the
common
mass
in
the
state
because
that
is
the
--
first
place,
the
limitation
on
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
state.
in
the
second
place,
any
legislature
would
certainly
have
some
such
policy
very
clearly
in
mind.
now,
our
courts
in
the
two
cases,
i'm
afraid
mr.
galt
has
cited
those.
they
are
both
liquor
cases
and
they
both
involved
the
matter
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
when
you
read
the
opinions
in
it
you'll
see,
and
the
second
case
citing
the
holding
in
the
first
case
puts
it
in
the
sentence,
neither
do
the
regulatory
powers
of
the
state
liquor
authority
extend
to
international
transactions,
even
to
alcoholic
beverages
except
sales
for
domestic
consumption
in
new
york
state.
now,
i'd
tackle
the
time
limitations
your
honor.
i
must
leave
a
whole
and
interesting
subject
to
what
the
twenty-first
amendment
means
to
my
brief.
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
i
have
a
collection
of
authorities
by
this
court
saying
expressly
that
where
the
transportation
is
solely
through
the
state
and
not
intended
to
use
the
liquor
authorities'
own
words,
for
use
or
delivery
within
the
state
that
it
is
not
affected
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
because
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
be
a
nation
and
we'd
be
at
the
mercy
of
every
coastal
state
on
the
atlantic
and
pacific
seaboard.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
this
court
has
held
in
reference
to
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
it
does
not
apply
to
foreign
commerce
going
through
the
state
only.
i
have
the
authorities
here.
but,
a
state
may
ask
for
a
permit
in
connection
with
that
transportation
so
as
to
know
who
is
bringing
it
in,
who's
carrying
it
and
where
it's
going.
in
other
words,
to
use
the
language
of
this
court,
there
may
be
a
reasonable
measure
of
protection
to
the
state
against
the
possibility
of
diversion,
but
here
of
course
is
total
elimination.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
that's
it.
mr.
charles
h.
tuttle
that's
it
and
they
say
that
because
of
that,
we're
out
of
business.
now
furthermore,
it
is
an
ownership
that
the
local
statute
unlike
those
statutes
where
this
court
spoke
about
the
case
of
permit
doesn't
provide
even
that
much.
there
is
no
regulatory
provisions
in
here.
the
argument
is,
we
are
out
because
there
is
no
provision
for
a
license
and
they
are
under
no
obligation
to
follow
us
up
with
a
permit
because
there
is
no
provision
for
a
permit.
in
other
words,
i
say
the
logic
of
the
whole
situation
is
that
the
legislature
knew
what
it
was
doing
and
they
were
intended
to
make
this
apply.
