mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
counsel
has
been
presenting
this
case
to
the
court
in
a
screen
of
derogatory
attitude
and
in
the
setting
of
some
rather
general
antitrust
conceptions.
now
it
seems
to
me
and
i
submit,
the
case
is
one
of
the
utmost
simplicity.
the
facts
could
quickly
be
stated
and
in
our
submission
would
dispose
of
this
case
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
so
with
the
court's
permission
i
shall
try
to
sum
up
the
facts
very
quickly.
there
are
of
course
many
ways
in
which
a
manufacturer
may
lawfully
merchandise
his
product.
he
may
sell
it
to
a
middleman
and
that
the
middleman
resells
and
in
this
manner
the
product
will
eventually
get
to
the
public
or
he
may
choose
to
sell
it
directly
to
the
public
himself
bypassing
the
middleman
entirely.
the
antitrust
law
doesn't
prohibit,
any
--
either
one
of
these
anymore
than
it
does
the
other,
it
permits
both.
now
in
the
oil
industry
refiners
have
used
both
methods.
many
of
them,
perhaps
most
of
them,
have
chosen
to
sell
to
middlemen
and
the
middleman
resells
and
in
some
cases
there
are
a
chain
of
middlemen.
some
like
the
largest
refiner
on
the
west
coast,
standard
oil
of
california
chooses
to
sell,
as
this
record
shows,
chooses
to
sell
both
ways.
through
its
sovereign
stations,
these
sovereign
stations
it
sells
to
a
middleman
and
the
middleman
resells,
but
it
also
through
its
standard's
stations
sells
directly
to
the
public.
now
if
a
manufacturer
chooses
to
sells
directly
to
the
public
obviously
he
must
sell
through
agents.
and
those
agents
maybe
wage
paid
employees
as
in
the
case
standard
stations,
but
they
need
not
be
and
in
selling
directly
to
the
public
standard
stations
obviously
fixes
the
price
at
which
each
one
of
those
stations
is
going
to
sell
gasoline
to
the
public
and
that
does
not
violate
the
antitrust
law
as
a
price
fixing
arrangement
because
it
is
a
case
of
the
owner
of
the
property
determining
the
price
at
which
he
himself
by
his
agents
will
sell
to
the
public.
now
there
is
another
ancient,
well
tried
traditional
method
of
selling.
it's
not
a
lawyer's
conception
and
that's
the
use
of
commission
paid
agents.
this
is
the
old
consignment
method.
in
california
it
is
recognized
by
one
of
the
sections
of
the
civil
code
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief,
which
describes
a
consignee,
and
i
think
i
am
quoting
from
memory,
an
agent
who
in
the
pursuit
of
an
independent
calling
is
entrusted
with
the
possession
of
property
of
his
principle,
which
he
therefore
sells
on
his
principle's
directions
and
at
the
prices
directed
by
his
principle.
that
code
section
comes
out
of
the
old
field
draft
codes
of
new
york
of
over
a
100
years
ago
and
thence
can
be
traced
right
back
to
blackstone.
now
if
the
court
pleases,
union
oil
company
used
to,
used
to
sell
to
the
middlemen
and
in
1955,
it
decided
it
would
discontinue
that
procedure
and
in
1955,
late
in
1954
it
thought
it
would
go
on
to
consignment
in
the
case
of
price
war
emergencies.
it
never
put
that
policy
into
effect.
instead
it
decided
early
in
1955,
it
would
adopt
that
as
a
permanent
system,
system
wide
and
it's
thus
completely
unlike
the
atlantic
refining
case
reasoned
before
the
federal
trade
commission
where
the
commission
said
atlantic
refining
would
be
on
consignment
one
day
and
purchase
and
sale
another.
union
doesn't
do
that.
now
let
me
get
over
to
the
question
of
leasing.
on
the
west
coast
there
are
over
36,000
service
stations
according
to
the
statistics
in
this
record.
in
about
two-thirds
of
those
36,000,
no
refiner
has
any
possessory
interest
whatever.
that
is
to
say
the
service
station
is
owned
by
the
man
who
operates
it
or
he
leases
it
from
some
one
who
has
no
connection
with
the
refiner.
less
than
a
third
are
owned
by
refiners,
because
in
the
severe
competition
among
the
traditional
seven
or
eight
majors
and
the
eight
or
nine
or
ten
additional
refiners
who
have
been
in
there
since
the
war,
it
has
been
imperative
for
the
refiner
to
find
an
outlet
for
his
gasoline.
and
in
that
process
many
of
these
refiners
have
gone
out
and
bought
the
fee
in
service
station
sites
or
else
they
have
leased
possessory
interest.
they
have
built
service
station
sites
and
then
they
have
turned
around,
in
case
of
standard
operated
by
employees,
in
case
of
others
they
have
leased
them
to
operators.
perhaps
one-third
of
the
stations
in
the
west
coast
are
in
this
category.
there
are
21,000
service
stations
at
least
in
california
on
the
statistics
on
this
record.
about
1/10th,
2400,
sell
union's
gasoline
up
and
down
in
california,
but
of
this
number
a
little
less
than
half
union
has
no
possessory
interest
at
all
in
it,
no
lease,
no
fee,
it
simply
deals
with
the
dealer.
slightly
over
half
of
this
2400,
union
does
own
the
property
or
has
a
lease
on
it
and
sub
leases
these
to
dealers.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
because
most
service
stations
sites
are
held
by
the
dealer
or
held
by
independent
people
who
think
it's
a
good
investment
and
lease
directly
to
the
dealer.
this
is
competition
between
various
factors
between
the
various
refiners
competing
for
sites
and
various
interests,
who
think
it's
a
good
investment
to
own
a
service
station
site
directly
so
the
company
doesn't
get
it.
and
i
think
these
figures
will
vary,
but
this
is
a
pretty
much
the
position
in
the
whole
industry,
little
less,
as
i
say
only
about
a
third
of
the
stations
are
owned
or
have
any
interest
in
the
refiner
themselves.
now
as
i
say
in
1955
union
decided
that
it
would
not
sell
gasoline
to
its
lessees
anymore.
it
continued
to
lease
out
its
stations
but
it
discontinued
selling
gasoline
to
the
lessees
and
adopted
the
policy
of
supplying
gasoline
to
these
stations
only
as
its
agents
to
sell
for
it.
i
think
the
record
shows
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
there
were
just
three
lessees
who
were
still
purchase
and
sale.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
they
sell
to,
they
will
sell
to
independent
stations,
but
it
is
very
interesting
that
they
also
consign
and
in
the
so
called
west
coast
oil
case
which
was
suit
brought
by
the
united
states
in
1950,
the
court
commented
that
more
than
1200
of
the
people
who
owned
their
own
stations
preferred
to
be
union
oil
consignees
because
he
said
and
i
quote,
i've
got
it
in
the
brief,
“the
factory
setup
may
provide
a
security
for
these
dealers,
which
they
find
more
desirable
than
the
rough
and
tumble
of
operating
their
own
business.”
so
this
is
how
it
turns
out
to
be.
mr.
moses
lasky
there
are
approximately
1300.
mr.
moses
lasky
little
over
half.
mr.
moses
lasky
that's
right
and
that's
--
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
now
let's
get
down
to
the
terms
of
the
consignment
agreement,
which
have
not
at
all
been
adequately
presented
to
the
court.
the
consignment
agreement
does
not
provide
that
the
dealer
must
or
will
take
any
gasoline
at
all
from
union
oil
company.
it
doesn't
provide
you
must
take
one
gallon,
it
doesn't
provide
that
union
must
provide
any
gasoline
to
him.
all
it
says
is
that
whatever
gasoline
union
he
sees
fit
to
take
and
whatever
gasoline
union
sees
fit
to
supply
will
be
handled
by
him
as
an
agent.
in
other
words,
when
a
man
become
a
lessee
the
consignment
agreement
made
clear,
that
if
he
was
going
to
get
gasoline
from
union,
he
will
be
handling
it
as
an
agent.
he
didn't
have
to
take
any.
it
didn't
preclude
him
from
going
out
and
buying
gasoline
from
anybody
else.
although
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
at
the
end
of
his
one-year
lease
he
had
been
getting
all
his
gasoline
from
someone
else,
i
would
hardly
be
surprised
that
the
company
might
decide
that
it
wouldn't
lease
to
him
again
and
this
to
me
is
just
commonsense.
why
should
it,
why
should
it,
it's
in
business
to
find
outlets
for
its
gasoline.
mr.
moses
lasky
if
he
didn't
take
any.
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
pleases,
when
a
man
comes
to
union
oil
and
says
i
want
to
be
a
union
dealer,
i
want
your
station
painted
with
all
your
colors,
he
is
doing
it
because
he
wants
to
handle
union
gasoline
and
not
joe
dox's
gasoline.
now
this
brings
me
to
richard
simpson.
richard
simpson
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
union
system
because
richard
simpson
for
eight
years
before
1956
was
a
wage
paid
employee
of
union
and
his
last
job
was
retail
representative,
that
is
to
say
he
was
union's
contact
to
the
dealers.
and
he
was
a
man
in
his
district,
who
put
into
effect
the
consignment
system.
he
knew
all
about
it.
he
knew
that
consignment
was
the
only
way
that
union
would
merchandise
its
branded
gasoline
through
its
leased
out
stations.
in
1956,
he
had
an
unfortunate
automobile
accident.
he
lost
his
job
with
the
company
and
then
he
came
to
union
and
says
well
i've
lost
my
job
but
i
would
like
to
be
a
union
dealer.
i
would
like
to
have
a
station
and
union
said
well
we
have
one
in
fresno
and
he
said
i
want
it
and
he
got
it,
on
their
standard
one-year
lease
and
he
signed
the
consignment
agreement.
he
brought
no
inventory
to
gasoline
at
that
time,
yes
there
was
a
dealer
there
was
another
dealer
in
there
before
him
and
the
testimony
shows
simpson
said
no,
i
didn't
buy
the
gasoline
because
gasoline
was
always
consigned
to
me,
i
didn't
have
to
buy
that.
he
did
put
up
15
--
$1300
to
buy
the
tools
from
the
former
person.
it
was
some
greases
and
stuff
and
union
oil
bought
those
from
the
former
dealer
and
sold
it
to
him
on
a
conditional
sales
contract
(inaudible).
now
nobody
coerced
this
gentleman
into
taking
this
station,
the
word
‘coercion'
is
being
used,
nobody
coerced
him,
he
wanted
to
be
a
union
dealer,
he
wanted
to
operate
a
union
station.
he
knew
the
terms
on
which
it
would
deal,
he
took
the
deal.
now
he
testified
during
the
deposition
that
before
the
expiration
of
his
one-year
term,
somewhere
he
gathered
the
idea
that
because
union
directed
the
prices
at
which
he
as
its
agent
was
to
sell
its
gasoline
consignment
was
illegal,
pursued
as
pricing
fixing
agreement.
now
–
one
of
the
court
asked
how
long
was
it
he
observed
consignment?
he
filed
an
affidavit
in
which
he
said
he
observed
it,
too
much
--
57
less
then
one-year
after
he
first
went
in.
and
then
his
affidavit
said
from
then
on
for
a
while
he
generally
observed
it
and
then
beginning
about
march
of
1958,
he
did
anything
he
pleased
absolutely.
although
he
got
the
idea
that
this
was
illegal
nevertheless
he
asked
for
another
one-year
lease
and
got
it.
he
choose
to
continue
with
the
consignment
agreement
believing
it
to
be
illegal
and
then
he
began
to
violate
that
agreement,
ignoring
his
instructions
that
were
given
to
him
as
the
company's
agent,
he
charged
more
or
less
as
he
saw
fit
when
he
saw
fit.
now
what
did
union
do?
it
didn't
sue
him,
to
try
to
compel
him
to
honor
the
agreement.
it
didn't
try
to
cancel
the
lease
for
the
consignment,
it
did
not
refuse
to
supply
him
with
gasoline,
it
suffered
the
whole
thing
very
patiently
outside
of
protesting
to
him
and
waited
the
passage
of
time
and
waited
the
efflux
of
time
and
when
his
term
expired,
when
on
the
evening
of
may
22nd
1958
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california,
he
no
longer
had
any
tenure
or
a
stake
in
this
property
as
was
later
adjudicated
in
an
unlawful
detainer
suit,
union
with
prior
notice
declined
to
give
him
a
new
lease.
it
declined
to
give
him
a
further
stake
in
its
california
real
property.
and
when
--
he
refused
to
vacate,
he
brought
this
suit
and
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
our
--
throwing
him
out
and
so
waited
patiently
till
we
had
a
hearing
and
then
the
injunction
was
denied
and
then
we
got
--
we
sued
him
in
the
state
court,
got
a
unlawful
detainer
and
we
recovered
possession.
now
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
having
been
denied
an
injunction
to
keep
him
in
permanent
possession,
he
amended
the
complaint
to
ask
for
damages.
and
the
damages
he
asked
for
were
$150,000
treble
because
union
refused
to
give
him
a
new
lease
on
its
property.
now
stripped
of
all
verbiage
what
is
mr.
simpson's
grievance?
it
is
if
union
refused
to
do
business
with
him
on
his
terms,
he
wanted
to
do
business
with
the
union,
he
wanted
to
occupy
its
valuable
service
station
site
in
which
it
had
invested
maybe
$70,000,
he
wanted
to
sell
its
gasoline
but
on
his
terms.
well
there
is
no
foundation
in
california
law
for
that
kind
of
claim,
and
so
he
turned
to
a
federal
antitrust
violation
and
he
added
to
makeweight
claim.
and
when
he
first
sued,
his
contention
was
that
on
march
1958
he
wanted
to
lower
his
price
and
we
won't
let
him
do
it
on
appeal
to
the
idea
that
maybe
we
were
over
pricing
the
public,
but
when
he
amended,
it
flipped
the
other
way
entirely.
his
compliant
is
that
he
lost
a
$1,000
during
the
term
of
the
two
years
because
he
could
not
charge
more
than
we
would
allow
him,
that
we
made
him
keep
his
prices
down.
that
is
of
course
a
makeweight
and
an
afterthought.
now
if
the
court
pleases
this
is
in
my
mind
a
remarkable
antitrust
case,
because
it
is
an
antitrust
case
without
monopolization
charge
and
without
conspiracy
charge.
there
is
not
only
but
one
defendant,
which
you
could
have
it
a
conspiracy
case,
but
the
case
involves
the
conduct
of
that
one
defendant
acting
alone
and
it
is
neither
conspiracy
or
monopolization.
the
complaint
does
not
charge
conspiracy
and
in
the
course
of
the
pretrial
conferences
counsel
told
the
court
repeatedly,
this
is
not,
i
am
quoting
now,
“this
is
not
a
conspiracy
case.
this
is
a
case
of
the
action
and
activities
of
a
single
defendant,”
and
he
said
again,
“the
complaint
does
not
charge
conspiracy,”
it
says
“these
contracts
are
in
restraint
of
trade.”
and
so
the
issue
of
legal
validity
in
this
case
comes
down
to
one
thing,
is
the
consignment
agreement
between
union
and
a
counselee
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
either
taken
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
of
a
lease.
there
is
no
conspiracy
with
any
other
manufacturer.
there
is
no
conspiracy
charge,
factual
conspiracy
charge
with
the
dealers.
now,
there
are
two
basic
reasons,
why
in
our
judgment
and
our
submission
the
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
recover.
as
i
have
just
submitted
both
claims
for
150,000
and
for
the
1,000
start
with
premise
that
consignment
agreement
was
unlawful
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
a
price
fixing
agreement.
with
that
premise
gone,
the
case
is
gone
obviously.
if
consignment
is
valid,
it
was
his
duty
to
observe
the
prices
and
he
couldn't
complain
because
he
couldn't
charge
more.
obviously
if
consignment
was
valid,
he
violated
it.
union
oil
company
would
have
been
idiotic
to
continue
to
give
leases
to
a
man
who
had
breached
a
legal
agreement.
so
i
say
that
this
is
the
basic
premise
of
the
case.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
it
didn't
reach
these
questions.
to
it
there
was
another
ground
for
why
the
plaintiff
could
not
recover
and
so
it
assumed,
it
did
not
decide
it
assumed
arguendo
these
claims
of
illegality.
it
said,
it
simply
stated
it's
this,
“that
whether
union
did
in
someway
or
other
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
virtue
of
consignment
and
lease,
neither
the
lease,
nor
the
consignment
agreement
inflicted
any
damage
on
simpson.”
now
this
is
not
a
question
of
how
much.
this
is
a
question
of
causation,
namely,
that
the
two
items
of
damage
which
he
claimed
are
not
the
result
of
the,
of
supposed
illegal
violations.
now
i
must
confess
that
i
very
much
dislike
discussing
this
case
in
the
context
of
an
assumption
that
we
violated
the
law.
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
did
it
and
i
suppose
that
the
questions
which
appeal
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari
must
have
had
some
relation
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
and
so
with
just
a
slight
touch
upon
validity
for
the
moment
i
am
going
to
move
over
to
the
second
aspect
of
the
case
and
come
back
to
the
questions
of
violation
later.
i
submit
if
the
court
pleases
that
consignment
in
which
of
course
is
implicit
that
the
consignor
determines
the
price
at
his
property
sold
is
not
remotely
illegal.
there
is
nothing
illegal
--
mr.
moses
lasky
oh!
if
my
words
meant
to
say
that
an
owner
or
consignor
always
sets
the
price,
i
of
course
overstated
it.
it
is
true
that
sometimes
a
consignor
will
allow
the
consignee
his
discretion
in
determining
the
price.
but
it's
more
frequently
the
owner
himself
who
determines
the
price.
now
there
is
no
cases
that
talk
about
price
fixing
or
horizontal
conspiracy
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
and
cases
that
talk
about
the
illegality
of
vertical
price
fix,
the
fixing
of
someone's
resale
price
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
because
we
do
not
hear
have
a
sale
and
resale.
there
was
not
sale
to
mr.
simpson
and
a
resale
by
him.
even
if
there
were,
as
we
have
submitted
in
the
brief
it
would
be
validated
by
the
california
fair
trade
act
and
the
mcguire
act.
now
with
that
just
so
i
don't
leave
the
impression
that
this
--
that
we've
done
anything
illegal,
let
me
move
on
to
the
second
aspect
of
this
case.
did
he
sustain
any
damage
caused
by
the
alleged
illegality?
now
no
matter
how
phrased
mr.
simpson's
main
claim
is
a
claim
for
damages
for
union's
refusal
to
give
him
a
new
lease.
now
suppose
when
mr.
simpson
first
saw
the
lease
in
1956
he
had
said
to
union
i
want
a
lease,
but
i
won't
be
consignee.
i
insist
on
buying
your
gasoline
and
union
said
sorry,
we
are
not
selling
gasoline
to
lessees,
we
only
make
them
agents
and
suppose
he
said,
i'm
not
going
to
be
a
consignee,
because
a
consignment
agreement
is
illegal
and
union
said,
well
we
are
not
going
to
lease
to
you
and
didn't.
could
mr.
simpson
have
come
in
to
sue
it
and
compel
it
to
lease
a
station
to
him
or
could
he
have
claimed
damages
for
its
refusal
to
give
him
a
station,
because
for
suit
it's
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
lease
to
him
was
his
unwillingness
to
enter
into
an
agreement
which
arguendo
we
assume
for
the
purposes
would
be
illegal.
now
i
submit
our
answer
is
obviously
not,
he
could
not
recover.
antitrust
law
imposes
no
duty
on
a
to
deal
with
b.
whatever
a's
reasons
maybe
so
long
as
it's
a's
unilateral
decision,
and
so
long
that
there
is
no
monopoly
of
course,
and
there
is
no
illegal
monopoly
of
ones
own
brand.
it's
not
illegal
for
one
to
refuse
to
deal
with
another
even
though
his
reason
is
that
the
other
refuses
to
follow
a
course
of
conduct
which
would
be
illegal
to
bind
him
to
buy
agreement.
i
take
it
that,
that
is
what
parke-davis
held.
so
much
of
the
colgate
doctrine
parke-davis
has
still
maintained.
now
then
what
greater
right
to
future
leases
did
mr.
simpson
get,
because
instead
of
refusing
to
sign
a
consignment
agreement,
he
signed
it
and
then
ignored
it.
certainly
his
rights
were
not
enlarged
by
the
fact
that
he
did
enter
into
that
consignment
agreement
for
a
space
of
time.
i
submit
he
did
not
thereby
acquire
the
right
to
still
further
leases.
during
the
existence
of
his
consignment
agreement
and
lease,
if
they
were
illegal,
simpson
could
have
repudiated
them,
but
even
so
while
repudiating
them
he
could
not
continue
to
exercise
rights
that
he
had
acquired
from
him,
he
could
not
say
they
are
illegal,
but
i
still
insist
upon
the
rights
i
got
from
them
and
as
i
take
it
that
is
the
reasoning
of,
i
believe
it
was
judge
learned
hand
in
ring
versus
the
authors
league
of
america
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
your
honors
will
perceive
that
simpson's
business
as
a
dealer
was
created
by
the
very
documents
he
now
challenges
as
illegal.
until
that
lease
and
that
consignment
mr.
simpson
never
was,
and
without
that
lease
and
consignment
he
never
would
have
been
a
union
dealer.
now
the
rationale
of
the
ring
decision
is
that
one
may
not
voluntarily
put
himself
into
a
position
or
relation,
then
claim
it
be
illegal
and
yet
insist
upon
maintaining
rights
derived
solely
from
them,
but
simpson's
case
is
even
weaker
than
that.
here
the
duration
of
the
lease
and
of
consignment
ended
by
their
own
terms
in
the
passage
of
time
and
i
submit
that
simpson
cannot
claim
a
right
to
a
new
lease
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
for
a
season
in
the
past
he
had
been
a
union
dealer,
solely
by
force
of
a
now
expired
lease
and
agreement
which
he
claims
to
be
illegal.
midnight
may
22,
1958
simpson
no
longer
had
any
estate
or
tenure
in
union's
property
under
the
laws
of
state
of
california
and
the
essential
question
therefore
in
this
branch
of
the
case
is
whether
federal
antitrust
law
somehow
imposed
on
union
a
duty
to
do
what
state
law
did
not
require
him
to
do,
give
him
a
further
term.
you
see
what
mr.
simpson
seeks
is
much
more
than
a
declaration
that
his
consignment
contract
was
illegal,
that's
a
moot
question,
because
that
consignment
no
longer
exists.
no
doubt
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
bring
a
prosecution
against
union
criminal
or
sue
to
enjoin
the
consignment
arrangements
if
it
thinks
its
illegal,
but
so
far
as
simpson
is
concerned,
the
question
of
whether
his
agreement
was
legal
or
illegal
is
a
moot
question.
i
submit
that
the
consignment
and
lease
even
granted
and
assumed
to
be
illegal
did
not
cause
your
supposed
damage
of
not
getting
a
new
lease.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
i
would
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
he
could
break
it.
i
would
make
exactly
the
same
argument
whether
it's
consignment
or
resale,
because
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
i
have
assumed
arguendo
that
consignment
is
illegal
and
the
only
basis
on
which
i
can
make
that
assumption
is
if
you
are
free
to
--
mr.
moses
lasky
oh
definitely.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
let's
assume
if
the
court
please,
i'll
take
that
up
now
while
we're
on
it.
let's
assume
if
fixing
the
sale
price
under
consignment
violates
the
antitrust
laws,
it
must
do
so
because
the
antitrust
law
conceives
of
consignment
as
sale
and
resale.
so
let's
assume
that's
what
it
was.
we
have
in
california
a
fair
trade
law,
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
says
that
you
can
buy
your
agreement
fixed
demands
resale
price
and
of
course
the
mcguire
act
recognizes
that
wherever
you
have
a
state
law.
now
here
is
an
agreement
that
says
a
written
agreement
that
says,
he'll
honor
this
price.
counsel
in
his
reply
brief
has
said
well
something
about
non-signers,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
non-signers.
in
all
these
consignment
agreements
they
are
all
signers
and
the
question
is
could
we
have
enforced
that
against
him.
counsel
has
also
said
well
the
mckesson
&
robbins
case
says
you
can't
enforce
a
fair
trade
agreement
where
you
sell
in
competition
and
i
don't
dispute
that,
but
we
don't
sell
in
competition.
the
record
shows
if
union
has
12
stations
in
california
maintained
by
it's
own
employees,
training
stations,
11
of
them
in
los
angeles
area
one
in
san
francisco.
now
as
the
chief
justice
knows
the
city
of
fresno
where
this
station
of
mr.
simpson
was
located
is
about
200
miles
from
the
one
and
about
200
miles
from
the
other,
they
are
not
in
competition,
in
other
words
union
oil
company
is
not
selling
to
the
public
in
fresno
unless
i
am
right
that
it
was
selling
to
it's
agent
in
which
event
mr.
simpson
was
not
it's
competitor
and
if
mr.
simpson
bought
from
them
and
resold
then
union
was
not
selling
in
fresno
and
so
i've
always
contended
that
even
if
consignment
was
resale
and
even
if
we
did
have
a
resale
price
fixed
here
it
was
perfectly
legal
under
the
california
fair
trade
act
and
the
mcguire
act.
i've
taken
up
that
point
out
of
order,
but
i
was
addressing
it
to
a
comment
of
your
honors.
now
let
me
take
the
second
aspect
of
this
case,
the
claim
$1,000
damages.
still
assuming
that
the
consignment
agreement
violated
the
law,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
man
says
he
suffered
a
$1,000
damages
because
he
couldn't
charge
what
he
wanted,
but
he
said
he
did
charge
what
he
wanted
whenever
he
wanted
to
charge
more
or
less
he
did
it,
how
could
he
say
he
could
not?
well
mr.
simpson
says
well
the
contract
bound
me,
but
if
the
contract
was
illegal
he
wasn't
bound
to
or
pay
any
attention
to
it
and
he
didn't.
then
counsel
says
or
his
client
says
well
i
thought
that
if
i
didn't
observe
the
prices
i
wouldn't
get
a
new
lease
and
so
we're
back
to
the
first
point
again.
certainly
people
in
business
are
constantly
confronted
with
economic
choices,
business
relations
if
they
follow
one
course
the
relation
will
exist,
if
they
follow
another
will
not,
and
i
assume
that
parke-davis
in
saying
that
you
could
announce
to
your
customers
if
you
have
a
policy
and
that
you
won't
deal
with
them
if
they
ignore
the
policy,
would
give
us
a
right
at
the
end
of
the
one-year
lease
if
we
didn't
like
his
pricing
policies
to
discontinue.
there
is
on
this
one
more
point
if
the
court
pleases?
where
a
agrees
with
b
to
perform
a
certain
line
of
conduct
and
from
time-to-time
it
does
so,
he
cannot
then
recover
damages
from
b
on
the
theory
that
b
could
not
have
compelled
him
to
perform
the
contract
for
illegality,
i
submit
that
to
be
true.
a
party
to
an
illegal
contract
may
ignore
it
if
he
wishes.
if
sued
illegality
would
be
a
defense,
he
cannot
however
observe
the
contract
and
then
recover
treble
damages
or
having
done
so.
now
this
isn't
a
question
of
pari
delicto
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
unclean
hands.
counsel
has
tried
to
inject
those
issues
into
this
case,
they
are
not
here.
the
point
is
that
when
i
as
mr.
simpson
choose
to
sell
at
a
certain
price
i'm
selling
at
that
price,
it
is
my
act
not
somebody
else's
act.
and
so
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
entirely
correct
in
both
of
its
decisions
on
the
$1,000
damage
and
$150,000
which
is
assuming
that
somehow
we
violated
the
sherman
act
arguendo,
nevertheless
there
could
be
no
recovery
because
the
aspects
of
damage
which
he
claimed
are
not
caused
by
the
alleged
illegality.
mr.
moses
lasky
there's
quite
a
history.
mr.
moses
lasky
he
was
motivated
by
--
in
part
by
mckesson
&
robbins.
mckesson
&
robbins
would
give
them
a
problem,
for
example
in
los
angeles.
they
could
not
have
fair
traded
in
my
judgment
because
they
had
12
stations
there
of
their
own.
mr.
moses
lasky
thank
you.
mr.
moses
lasky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
shortly
before
the
adjournment
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
some
questions
about
the
numbers
of
stations
and
summed
up
the
figures
and
i
affirmed
them.
now
to
be
sure
that
i
did
not
misunderstand
i
am
going
to
state
just
what
the
figures
are.
the
reference
to
the
record
is
pages
333
and
334.
the
total
number
of
stations
selling
union’s
branded
gasoline
in
california
is
2,377.
of
this
number
in
1,335
union
has
some
sort
of
possessory
interest,
either
the
fee
or
the
master
lease
and
of
this
1,335
stations
all
but
three
are
consignee
stations,
the
lessee
is
a
consignee.
now
of
the
2,377
total
stations,
in
1,030;
slightly
less
than
half
union
has
no
possessory
interest
of
any
kind
whatsoever.
they
are
owned
by
other
parties
unconnected
with
any
refinery,
and
of
the
1,030
stations
in
which
union
has
no
possessory
interest,
approximately
80%
are
also
consignees,
that
is
to
say
these
80%
who
have
no
landlord-tenant
relationship
to
union
have
chosen
and
preferred
to
be
consignees
instead
of
buying
and
selling
and
this
reminds
me
again
of
the
remarks
made
by
the
district
court
in
the
west
coast
oil
case
when
he
summed
up
the
situation,
that
this
vast
number
indicates
that
they
would
prefer
the
security
of
a
consignment
system
to
the
rough
and
tumble
of
being
merchants
buying
and
selling.
yesterday
i
but
briefly
indicated
a
statement
that
the
union
oil
company
had
not
in
fact
violated
the
antitrust
laws
or
any
part
of
them
in
any
respect
whatsoever
and
i
had
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
basic
question
there,
the
basic
attack
of
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner,
the
fundamental
one
was
his
consignment
in
which
the
consignor
determines
the
price
at
which
the
consignee
is
to
sell
the
consignor’s
gasoline
is
that
price
fixing,
illegal
price
fixing
agreement?
and
i
submit
it
was
not
because
one
does
not
violate
the
law
on
determining
the
price
at
which
his
own
property
is
to
be
sold.
and
i
therefore
submitted
that
cases
like
the
masonite
case
are
not
in
point
because
masonite
was
a
horizontal
conspiracy
and
of
course
we
have
no
questions
at
all
about
the
illegality
of
any
kind
of
horizontal
conspiracy
about
price,
nor
i
submit
were
the
resale
price
maintenance
cases
have
any
bearing
here,
holding
vertical
price
fixing
illegal
because
there
was
no
sale
and
resale,
although
i
also
submitted
that
if
this
were
a
sale
and
a
resale,
the
california
fair
trade
act
and
the
mcguire
act
would
also
legalize
the
transactions.
mr.
moses
lasky
if
not
consignment,
yes
your
honor.
if
it
were
sale
and
resale
and
wasn’t
in
a
state
that
had
a
fair
trade
act,
i
don’t
doubt
its
illegality.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
it
was
an
issue
in
the
case,
but
no
court
ever
found
it
necessary
to
decide
it.
the
district
court
held
that
consignment
was
consignment
and
was
legal
and
that
there
was
no
actionable
damage
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
reach
any
of
these
questions
of
--
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
not
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
it
is,
yes
it’s
briefed.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
court
below
has
determined
it,
but
if
i
understand
the
law
correctly
when
a
case
is
before
this
court,
it
can
affirm
upon
any
legal
question
that’s
involved.
now
all
the
facts
upon
the
mcguire
act
are
here
in
the
record
and
it
was
an
issue
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
all
the
record
was
made
and
the
laws,
the
law
which
the
court
takes
judicial
notice.
so
unless
i'm
in
error
upon
my
understanding,
if
the
judgment
is
correct
upon
any
ground,
it
is
correct
and
it
had
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
oh
that’s
in
the
record.
westway
is
a
–
number
one
on
westway
there
--
westway
is
a
subsidiary,
the
evidence
is
union
has
an
interest
in
it
and
westway
has
no
stations
except
in
oregon
and
washington
and
the
los
angeles
area,
nothing
in
the
fresno
area.
the
record
is
clear
on
that
also.
oh!
no
the
record
is
quite
complete.
mr.
moses
lasky
that’s
right
it
has
no
station
operated
of
its
own.
it
only
has
12
in
california,
of
which
in
11
are
in
los
angeles
area
and
one
in
san
francisco,
and
fresno
is
about
200
miles
from
each
of
these
places,
no
the
record
is
quite
complete
on
this.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh
i
think
so
absolutely,
and
for
this
reason.
if
this
a
sale
or
resale
then
you’ve
got
a
contract
--
mr.
moses
lasky
well
i
must
confess
i
have
difficulty
of
seeing
how
it
can
be
–
it
is
either
fish
or
flesh
and
it
can't
be
something
else.
it's
either
consignment
or
it’s
sale
and
if
it’s
sale
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
exactly
within
the
terms
of
the
fair
trade
act
that
a
vendor
can
enter
into
a
contract
with
his
vendee
determining
his
price.
i've
always
taken
the
position
though
that
it's
just
what
it
says
it
is
consignment,
and
that’s
what
i'd
like
to
present
to
the
court
now.
mr.
moses
lasky
pardon
me.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
term
fair
trade
was
never
mentioned
to
the
dealers,
but
this
itself
would
is
not
necessary
because
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
california
act
or
the
mcguire
act
decision
which
used
some
magic
term
fair
trade,
it
says
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
the
buyer,
fixing
his
price
and
this
contract
does
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh
yes,
but
to
--
that’s
true,
we
have
no
question
about
non-signers
here
because
the
question
is
only
could
we
bind
our
consignee
and
every
consignee
has
signed
this
agreement,
so
we
don’t
have
a
non-signer
problem
here
at
all
if
the
court
please.
mr.
moses
lasky
nothing
at
all,
he
gets
the
first
tank
of
gasoline
and
he
does
not
pay
for
it.
then
when
this
is
exhausted
in
whole
or
in
part
and
another
truck
comes
up
replenishes
it,
he
accounts
for
what
he's
already
sold.
so
he
never
--
mr.
moses
lasky
no.
mr.
moses
lasky
the
proceeds
--
the
agreement
provides
that
he
must
keep
the
proceeds
separate.
mr.
moses
lasky
no
he
doesn’t.
now
in
this
particular
case,
a
man
named,
the
record
shows
this,
a
man
name
gregorian
had
been
the
prior
lessee
and
when
mr.
gregorian
left
and
mr.
simpson
came
in,
mr.
simpson
bought
gregorian’s
tools
and
there
was
a
stock
of
tires
and
accessories
which
union
had
nothing
to
do
it,
and
union
bought
those
and
sold
it
to
mr.
simpson
on
a
conditional
sales
contract,
financed
him,
but
upon
the
gasoline
he
testified,
this
is
in
my
brief
at
page
57
and
from
311
of
the
record
about
this
very
episode.
did
pay
buy
the
gasoline,
but
not
gasoline?
he
says
no,
it
didn’t
include
gasoline
because
it
was
on
consignment,
so
he
never
paid
for
that.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
consignment
question
has
been
flatly
ruled
on
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
general
electric
company
in
272
u.s.
476.
there
general
electric
some
years
before
had
been
subjected
to
a
decree,
enjoining
it
from
a
conspiracy
to
fix
resale
prices
and
thereafter
it
devised
a
consignment
scheme
and
as
shown
by
the
opinion
of
this
court,
it
presented
the
scheme
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
approval
or
disapproval
and
as
the
court
notes
in
the
opinion,
received
no
reply
of
any
kind
whatsoever,
but
it
put
the
plan
into
effect
and
this
court
held
the
consignment
was
clearly
legal.
now
i
call
attention
to
that
because
in
this
union’s
consignment
system
has
also
been
presented
to
the
attorney
general
and
has
been
approved.
i
say
that
because
in
the
west
coast
oil
case
where
we
hammered
out
a
consent
decree,
that
consent
decree
specifies
that
every
refiner
on
the
west
coast,
every
refiner
defendant
must
gave
to
--
both
a
supply
agreement
and
a
lease
and
says
the
supply
agreement
maybe
a
consignment
agreement
or
a
purchase
and
sale
agreement
and
it
defines
a
consignee
in
the
terms
of
the
california
civil
code
as
an
agent,
who
in
the
pursuit
of
an
independent
calling
will
sell
the
gasoline
to
the
refiner
at
the
prices
specified
by
the
refiner.
now
the
record
also
--
this
case
discloses
something
else.
that
decree
in
it's
draft
was
clear
to
me,
but
to
be
sure
that
there
was
no
misunderstanding
with
the
department
of
justice,
i
wrote
the
department
of
justice
a
letter
before
i
signed
the
consent
on
behalf
of
union
and
asked
if
they
construed
it
the
same
way
and
at
page
330
of
this
record
you
will
find
a
letter
addressed
to
me
from
the
department
of
justice
saying
that
the
provisions
of
that
decree
against
resale
price
maintenance,
and
the
decree
went
into
effect
i
may
say
lay
after,
less
or
after
mr.
simpson
was
out
of
our
station,
says
that,
that
of
course
does
not
apply
to
the
consignor
fixing
the
price
at
which
his
consignee
may
sell.
so
unlike
general
electric,
union’s
plan
has
been
before
the
department
of
justice,
has
met
with
no
objection,
and
has
been
held
to
be
legal.
of
course
that’s
not
binding
on
the
court,
but
it
does
show
what
a
law
enforcement
agency
thinks
of
the
matter.
mr.
moses
lasky
your
honor
that
letter
appears
at
330
of
the
record.
now
early
this
year
in
the
state
of
california
they
finally
reached
--
the
highest
courts
that
had
the
question,
appellate
court,
the
question
whether
exactly
this
kind
of
consignment
arrangement
by
a
refiner
violated
the
california
antitrust
law
which
of
course
is
the
same
as
the
sherman
act.
and
in
the
case
shasta
douglas
oil
company
versus
work,
the
court
held
that
patently
it
did
not,
because
the
consignee
is
an
agent
and
the
consignor
can
set
his
prices.
it
is
very
interesting
to
observe
that
only
a
few
months
ago,
the
uniform
state
law
commissioners
had
attempted
to
draft
a
uniform
state
antitrust
law
prepared
and
as
pointed
out
in
my
brief
at
page
41,
that
draft
makes
it
explicit,
that
consignment
transactions
have
not
been
included
because
the
principle
is
at
liberty
to
control
the
price
and
other
terms
upon
which
his
agent
may
dispose
of
his
commodities
or
service.
and
in
the
famous
standard
oil
versus
united
states
in
337
u.s.,
the
standard
stations
cases,
there
was
as
i
recall
the
statements
in
the
opinion
and
in
a
dissenting
opinion
that
if
exclusive
dealing
contracts
were
outlawed,
the
companies
would
very
likely
go
back
to
owning
their
own
stations
and
selling
through
their
wage
paid
employees
or
through
consignment,
either
scheme
of
which
would
be
legal.
now
i
therefore
enquire
how
is
it
that
the
counsel
for
mr.
simpson
contends
that
consignment
has
suddenly
become
illegal.
i
had
thought
until
yesterday
at
about
five
minutes
before
counsel
finished
his
argument,
that
he
was
turning
it
upon
the
fact
that
there
not
one
consignee
but
a
great
many.
that
contention
would
not
have
been
a
sound
contention,
because
exactly
the
same
argument
was
made
to
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case.
in
the
court’s
opinion
it
points
out
how
the
government
had
argued
that
there
were
so
many,
such
a
great
number
of
stations
consignees,
401
class
and
22,000
in
the
other
and
this
court
said
it
made
no
difference
because
the
distinction
between
agency
and
purchaser,
be
it
as
clear
both
in
law
and
in
fact
that
of
course
if
you
stopped
to
observe,
the
number
would
make
no
difference
because
economically
the
same
result
would
follow
if
union
took
over
these
1,300
consignee
stations
and
put
wage
paid
employees
in.
it
would
then
control
the
direct
retail
distribution
of
1,300
stations
and
counsel
conceded
in
the
court
below
there
would
be
nothing
illegal
about
that.
so
the
illegality,
if
there
is
any,
cannot
come
in
because
there
is
more
than
one
station.
it
would
have
to
come
in
because
it
is
consignment
or
not,
and
counsel
as
i
understood
in
yesterday
and
a
reply
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
white
said
his
contention
would
be
the
same
even
though
there
was
but
one
consignment.
now
counsel’s
next
point
of
attack
if
i
understand
him
correctly
is
purpose,
our
purpose
he
said
was
to
fix
price.
well
at
the
time
of
the
case
heard
below
in
order
to
eliminate
all
issues
of
fact
i
stipulated
that,
that
was
one
of
our
purposes
not
that
we
could
control
a
resale
price,
no,
but
so
that
we
could
control
price
at
which
our
product
was
sold,
but
that’s
irrelevant
and
let
me
quote
to
the
court
from
this
court’s
decision
in
the
general
electric
case
again.
“the
plan
was
of
course
devised
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
company
to
deal
directly
with
consumers
and
purchasers
and
doubtless
was
indented
to
avoid
selling
the
lamps
owned
by
the
company
to
jobbers
or
dealers
and
prevent
sale
by
these
middlemen
to
consumers
at
different
and
competing
prices.”
that’s
the
quotation
from
the
court.
nevertheless
this
court
said
it
made
no
difference,
because
the
distinction
in
law
and
in
fact
between
agency
and
sale
is
clear.
now
at
the
very
close
of
the
argument
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
why
we
shifted,
why
union
shifted
in
1955,
and
in
the
haste
of
the
red
light
in
front
of
me,
i
did
not
give
a
full
answer.
i
mentioned
mckesson
&
robbins
decision
had
some
effect
upon
it.
the
story
is
this.
there
are
of
course
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
each
of
the
several
merchandising
methods
available
to
a
manufacturer,
and
he
must
make
his
choice,
if
he
takes
one
he
has
some
advantages
and
he
has
some
disadvantages.
now
another
disadvantage
of
using
middlemen,
selling
to
them
and
having
them
resale
in
this
business
is,
and
this
court
knows
it
very
clearly
certainly
in
view
of
the
recent
sun
oil
decision,
the
veritable
host
of
problems
and
dilemmas
you
have
under
robinson-patman.
another
is
the
fact
that
if
you
don’t
sell
through
these
stations
as
your
agents,
the
quality
of
them
can
run
down
and
they
won’t
give
the
proper
service.
now
in
a
union
station,
they
are
in
union’s
colors,
this
is
where
union
meets
the
public
face-to-face,
and
to
the
public
these
stations
are
union
and
union’s
reputation
turns
upon
the
kind
of
service
it
gets
there
and
therefore
the
company
has
an
interest
in
having
something
to
say
about
those
stations
and
of
course
if
it
sells
through
them
and
the
resale
it
has
nothing
to
say
about
them,
except
in
a
very
remote
kind
of
way.
now
these
disadvantages
union
wanted
to
eliminate.
they
could
have
been
eliminated
by
doing
what
standard
oil
does,
put
wage
paid
employees
in,
but
there
union
ran
up
against
what
it
conceived
to
be
another
disadvantage.
a
wage
paid
employee
has
no
stake
in
the
community.
he
is
not
--
he
has
no
incentive
and
union
felt
that
if
it
had
consignees
who
received
a
commission
they
would
have
a
status
of
businessmen
in
the
community,
they
would
have
an
incentive.
now
union’s
merchandizing
judgment
may
have
been
sound,
may
have
been
unsound
in
weighing
these
advantages,
but
it
wasn’t
i
submit,
illegal.
there
were
advantages
not
only
to
union,
but
of
course
there
were
advantages
to
the
consignees
and
we
come
back
to
the
fact
that
80%
of
those
who
have
no
landlord
or
tenant
relationship
to
union
still
saw
fit
to
be
consignees.
there
are
disadvantages,
many
disadvantages
to
union.
for
example
there
was
a
decision
rendered
by
an
intermediate
california
appellate
court
last
year
that
held
union
liable
for
tort,
personal
injuries
for
the
negligence
of
a
consignee,
because
he
was
his
agent.
so
it
happened
that
the
supreme
court
set
aside
that
decision
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
in
that
case
no
cause
or
relationship
on
the
act
of
any
defendant
in
the
case,
but
this
is
the
kind
of
risk
we
run
and
we
take
this
risk
and
disadvantage
in
order
to
balance
off
the
whole
picture.
more
than
that,
not
all
the
burdens
which
have
been
shifted
from
the
dealer
on
to
union
by
virtue
of
the
consignment
arrangement,
and
this
brings
me
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
is
this
consignment
or
is
it
sale.
counsel
has
contended
it’s
sale,
but
note
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law,
counsel
has
never
said
that
he
intended
to
prove
or
wanted
to
prove
that
this
arrangement
was
something
other
and
different
than
what
it
appeared
to
be
on
the
face
of
the
documents.
he
made
clear
from
the
very
beginning
that
he
was
saying
that
on
the
face
of
the
document
he
contended
it
was
sale
and
one
of
the
first
pretrial
conferences
where
we
tried
to
delimit
the
issues,
he
said,
“i
say”,
and
i'm
reading
from
378
of
the
record,
he
says
“i
say
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
on
the
issue
of
liability,
number
one
the
consignment
agreement
is
unlawful
on
it’s
face
as
a
matter
of
law.”
and
this
of
course
i
would
have
no
objection
to
presenting
in
a
pretrial
of
partial
summary
judgment.
the
other
issue
he
said
was
whether
we
had
coerced
him
and
i
asked
do
you
mean
by
coercion
anymore
than
the
fact
that
if
you
wanted
our
station
you
had
to
get
it
on
the
terms
we
offered
and
he
says
that’s
all
i
mean,
so
i
stipulated
well
those
are
the
facts,
if
that’s
coercion
that’s
coercion,
which
took
that
issue
or
fact
out
of
the
case.

pardon.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
mr.
moses
lasky
oh
let
me
state
this.
if
this
is
not
consignment,
and
if
it
is
sale
and
resale,
and
if
we
don’t
have
the
mcguire
act,
i
can’t
see
any
answer
to
the
conclusion
that
the
agreement,
the
written
agreement
was
illegal
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
moses
lasky
not
at
all.
mr.
moses
lasky
that
was
the
point
i
wished
to
submit
yesterday.
sure
we
could
then
be
prosecuted
by
the
attorney
general
criminally.
we
would
be
subject
to
a
suit
in
equity
by
the
attorney
general
to
enjoin
us
from
continuing
the
progress.
mr.
moses
lasky
but
i
tell
the
difference
--
mr.
moses
lasky
exactly
so.
the
identical
argument
i
made
yesterday.
the
argument
i
made
yesterday
went
off
on
the
assumption
arguendo
that
the
whole
consignment
arrangement
was
an
illegal
violation
of
the
law
and
i
did
that
upon
the
assumption
that
you’d
call
it
a
purchase
and
sale,
because
i
can’t
conceive
how
otherwise
it
could
be
illegal.
that
was
the
whole
brunt
of
my
argument
yesterday
if
the
court
pleases
and
that
is
the
position
the
court
of
appeals
took.
they
said
assuming
arguendo
illegality,
nevertheless
the
failure
to
get
a
new
lease
was
not
the
result
of
that
consignment
agreement.
it
was
that
union
exercise
it’s
judgment
when
then
tenure
expired
not
to
give
them
a
new
statements
property
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
not
doubt
about
it,
i
stipulated
it
to
that,
in
order
to
remove
that
from
an
issue
of
fact,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
then
what
do
we
have,
we
have
a
case
where
a
man
refuses
to
clearly
on
a
course
of
conduct
which
it
would
be
illegal
to
bind
him
to
by
agreement.
this
is
the
assumption,
but
i
thought
the
parke-davis
case
certainly
held
so
much
that
acting
not
in
conspiracy
with
anybody
else
you
could
refuse
to
deal
with
a
man
even
for
that
reason,
and
there’s
a
host
of
cases
that
have
so
held
because
the
refusal
to
give
him
a
new
lease
is
still
our
unilateral
decision.
now
in
a
conspiracy
case
it
isn’t
the
decision
of
the
man
who
cuts
them
off,
his
decision
becomes
the
decision
of
a
group
of
conspirators,
but
absent
conspiracy,
absent
monopoly,
i
submit
that
that
is
the
law,
that
you
can
refuse
to
enter
into
future
business
relations
with
a
man
even
though
your
reason
for
doing
so
is
his
refusal
to
go
along
with
an
illegal
course
of
conduct.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
submit
not,
i
think
clearly
of
course
a
man
could
not
in
the
first
instance
come
in
and
say
i
want
that
lease
and
you’ve
got
to
give
it
to
me
because
your
refusal
is
based
upon
my
refusal
to
be
a
consignee.
but
as
i
submitted
yesterday
he
now
enters
into
the
agreement
and
then
the
day
after
he
says
i
enter
into
it
he
breaches
it
and
by
this
welshing
upon
the
deal,
even
though
the
deal
is
illegal
he
gives
himself
some
kind
of
tenure
beyond
the
scope
of
state
law
which
otherwise
he
did
not
have.
now
this
is
certainly
a
curious
logical
result.
it
comes
back
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
your
honor
wrote
that
opinion
and
you
know
better
than
i
what
you
had
in
mind,
but
i
certainly
so
read
it.
i
understand
parke-davis
to
do
this.
the
question
there
was
whether
there
was
a
conduct,
this
was
a
suit
by
the
united
states,
no
question
of
whether
it
caused
damage,
the
sole
question
was
legality
or
illegality
of
conduct.
and
i
thought
that
what
the
court
did
is
to
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
and
said
that
if
you
announce
a
policy
that
you
expect
that
you
--
price
policy
among
other
things,
that
you
expect
your
dealers
to
follow
and
they
don’t
follow
it
and
you
cut
them
off,
that’s
unilateral
conduct
and
does
not
violate
the
law.
if
you
go
beyond
it,
the
facts
may
be
the
basis
of
inferring
a
conspiracy.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
certainly
did,
i
certainly
did.
mr.
moses
lasky
well
to
that
i
can
only
reply
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
bar
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
parke-davis
does
not
so
hold,
because
you
have
granted.
in
this
case
you
do
not
have
to
look
at
a
lot
of
external
circumstances
to
infer
the
existence
of
an
agreement
as
you
did
in
parke-davis.
here
the
agreement
is
expressed,
explicit
and
in
writing.
that
agreement
is
either
legal
because
it’s
consignment
and
because
the
mcguire
act
protects
it
or
it
is
illegal.
this
we
don’t
have
any
difficulties
on
this.
if
it
is
illegal,
why
doesn’t
then
vendor
still
have
the
right
to
say
this
is
my
real
property,
the
estate
that
the
gentlemen
has,
has
expired,
why
do
i
have
to
give
him
a
further
tenure
and
the
only
answer
would
be,
well
because
you
have
violated
the
law
up
to
now.
there
is
an
additional
penalty
that
you
must
now
give
this
gentlemen,
a
conditional
tenure
that
the
state
law
does
not
entitle
him
to.
now
if
that
is
the
law
--
mr.
moses
lasky
yes.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
i
stipulated
that
the
one
--
the
reason
he
did
not
have
his
lease
renewed
was
that
he
had
violated
that
agreement.
now
i
said
there
were
other
reasons
and
the
trial
court
says,
well
why
don’t
simplify
it,
don’t
you
just
rely
on
the
one
string
to
your
bow
and
i
did,
that’s
the
state
of
the
record
before
this
court.
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
get
this
thing
into
a
posture
of
a
clean
set
of
questions
of
law.
mr.
moses
lasky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moses
lasky
we
had
no
right
under
the
lease
to
cancel
it.
it
was
a
one
year
lease,
absolute
with
the
right
in
the
lessee
to
cancel
on
30
days
notice,
but
no
right
in
us
to
cancel.
so
we
couldn’t
do
it.
mr.
moses
lasky
well,
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
logic
of
my
argument
would
say
so.
mr.
moses
lasky
it
is
not
of
course
the
situation
in
this
case.
we
have
no
right
to
cancel.
we
made
no
effort
to
cancel.
we
waited
till
the
normal
term
expired.
mr.
moses
lasky
they
were
signed
concurrently.
they
are
two
different
arguments,
they
were
signed
concurrently.
the
consignment
provision
agreement
provides
that
it’ll
run
for
a
year
and
thereafter
until
cancelled
and
will
also
terminate
whenever
the
lease
should
terminate.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
we
are
in
a
much
better
position.
mr.
moses
lasky
i
think
we
are
in
a
much
better
position.
i
think
it’s
always
been
said
there
is
a
basic
right
to
a
manufacturer
that
he
doesn’t
have
to
sell
to
anybody.
now
even
if,
if
that
rule
is
eroded,
if
erosion
has
set
in
on
that,
i
think
it’s
quite
a
different
proposition
to
say
that
you’ve
got
to
lease
real
property
to
a
man,
to
give
him
a
tenure.
now
if
mr.
simpson
owned
his
own
service
station,
and
we
declined
to
deal
with
him
further,
then
we’d
have
a
pretty
close
to
a
parke-davis
situation.
but
he
didn’t
own
his
service
station
and
the
question
is
can
he
get
a
lease
and
tenure
of
real
property
from
us
and
i
think
that
is
an
enormous
jump
from
any
distance
that
any
court
has
yet
seen
fit
to
go
on
the
erosion
away
of
the
old
colgate
doctrine.
well
the
light
is
on
so
i
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
