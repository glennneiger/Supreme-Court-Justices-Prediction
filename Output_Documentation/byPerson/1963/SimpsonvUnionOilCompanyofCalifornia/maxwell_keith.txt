mr.
maxwell
keith
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
in
summary
judgment
that
was
entered
against
the
plaintiff
below,
the
petitioner
here.
this
is
an
action
brought
under
the
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
which
allows
any
person
who
is
injured
in
trade
or
rather
in
his
business
or
property
to
--
by
reason
of
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
sue
thereof
and
obtain
his
damages
to
the
treble
and
counsel
fees
to
be
granted.
there
are
six
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
major
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
a
major
oil
company,
who
is
having
thousands
of
service
station
sites,
can
regiment
a
dealer
organization
admittedly
composed
of
independent
businessmen
who
are
in
business
for
their
own
profit
or
loss
by
a
scheme
which
involves
the
issuing
of
a
one-year
lease
and
then
(inaudible)
dependant
on
whether
or
not
the
dealer
prescribes
or
obeys
retail
price
fixing
orders.
this
is
regardless
of
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
the
dealer
--
regardless
of
how
long
he
has
been
on
that
service
station
site
and
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
is
admitted
that
the
respondent
does
continually
renew
these
one-year
leases
as
a
matter
of
its
practice
to
those
dealers
who
do
obey
the
orders
of
the
respondent
union
oil
company.
mr.
maxwell
keith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
specifically
alleges
that
he
lost
his
service
station
business
because
he
did
not
obey
price
orders
and
that
he
was
threatened
by
respondent's
agents
that
he
would
better
raise
his
prices
or
he
would
be
out
of
the
service
station
site.
mr.
maxwell
keith
your
honor,
we
are
in
a
situation
here
where
these
facts
are
stipulated
by
counsel
for
respondent
and
let
me
answer
your
question
by
enumerating
at
this
time
the
stipulations
that
are
in
this
record
as
i
understand
them
as
a
result
of
the
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
let
me
say
as
to
that
matter
that
petitioner
had
filed
interrogatories
to
the
respondent
mainly
on
the
interstate
commerce
issue
and
that
the
district
court
thereupon
entered
an
opinion
in
which
he
said
that
he
did
not
feel
that
pretrial
discovery
should
be
granted
until
pretrial
conferences
which
defined
the
issues.
and
thereupon
we
had
two
pretrial
conferences
in
which
there
were
suggestions
that
this
case
could
be
first
stipulated
and
then
brought
to
the
appellate
courts.
when
that
stipulation
broke
down
there
was
suggestion
that
counsel
for
plaintiff
file
a
pretrial
statement
for
a
pretrial
ruling
that
counsel
for
respondent
would
then
admit
or
deny
those
facts
and
that
the
appeal
to
be
taken
in
that
direction.
now
there
--
so
that
pretrial
statement
or
pretrial
ruling
is
in
the
record.
however,
counsel
did
not
or
respondent
did
not
accept
this
pretrial
statement
and
rather
he
noticed
the
deposition
of
the
plaintiff
for
a
deposition.
the
deposition
was
taken.
portions
of
the
deposition
were
thereafter
abstracted
and
presented
to
the
court
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
all
issues
and
that
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
all
issues,
stipulations
were
further
continued
by
respondents
and
at
that
conference
it
was
suggested
that
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here,
file
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
which
was
done.
now
that
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
was
denied
and
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
all
issues
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
now
these
pretrial
conferences,
including
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
raise
five
distinct
stipulations
by
the
respondent
union
oil
company.
as
i
have
urged
in
my
brief
these
stipulations
were
inevitable
because
the
records
consisting
of
policy
letters
concerning
this
consignment
program
pretty
much
corroborated
and
compelled
these
stipulations.
now
the
first
is,
there
is
no
question
that
the
only
lease
that
union
oil
would
write
was
the
one-year
lease.
the
only
consignment
agreement
was
a
one-year
consignment
agreement.
however,
that
consignment
agreement
was
carried
on
year-to-year,
assuming
the
lease
was
renewed.
it
was
stipulated
that
the
only
manner
in
which
a
service
station
dealer
could
obtain
a
lease
from
union
oil
company
was
to
subscribe
or
sign
the
retail
dealer
consignment
agreement
of
union
oil
company.
now,
this
particular
tie-in
affected
approximately
2000
service
station
sites
in
the
eight
specific
state
areas
and
also
the
consignment
agreement
was
entered
into
with
other
purchase
and
sales
accounts
so
that
there
are
(inaudible)
here
in
2000
tie-in
consignment
agreements
and
an
additional
approximately
1000
consignment
agreements
with
other
types
of
accounts.
it
is
also
stipulated
that
a
lease
would
not
be
renewed
if
the
dealer
did
not
carry
out
the
authorized
directives
of
the
consignment
retail
price
fixing
program.
it
was
further
stipulated
that
this
particular
plaintiff's
lease
was
not
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
year
because
he
did
in
fact
disobey
the
orders
of
union
oil
company
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
he
did
not
obey
the
price
fixing
order,
i
think
it's
narrowed
to
that
extent,
the
price
fixing
orders.
i
have
in
my
brief
set
forth
that
quotation
in
full
i
believe.
i
would
--
the
record
of
409,
“it
is
a
conceded
fact
in
the
case
that
he,
the
plaintiff,
did
violate
the
consignment
agreement
because
he
refused
the
charges
which
is
principal
of
the
union
oil
company
prescribed
for
him
to
charge.”
then
he
goes
on
above
that
and
says,
“we
did
not
give
him
a
new
lease
because
he
violated
the
consignment
agreement”
and
see
also
record
citation
299,
where
that
stipulation
is
put
into
the
moving
papers
of
the
respondent.
the
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
is
counsel
for
respondent.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
is
mr.
lasky
the
counsel
for
respondent.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
is
the
stipulation,
yes
and
also
that
stipulation
is
put
in
writing
at
the
record
299.
in
addition,
the
last
stipulation,
i
would
like
to
call
for
the
court's
attention,
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
for
--
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
stipulated
that
a
purpose
of
the
retail
dealer
consignment
program
was
to
fix
prices.
one
state
in
the
record
--
one
section
of
the
record
was
a
purpose
and
then
it
was
a
purpose
among
other
purposes
was
to
fix
the
retail
prices.
now
in
addition
as
i
have
indicated
to
these
stipulations
during
the
pretrial
proceedings
counsel
for
the
respondent
submitted
to
the
plaintiff's
counsel
the
so
called
policy
letters,
which
were
letters
issued
by
the
general
sales
manager
of
the
union
oil
company
to
the
division
managers
in
which
he
explains
in
detail,
gave
instructions
to
them
concerning
this
consignment
program.
now
we
were
touching
upon
the
issues
of
the
case
but
believe
the
major
issue
would
be
that
first
issue
whether
or
not
you
can
regiment
a
marketing
system
and
cull
off
independent
judgments
as
to
prices
by
utilizing
this
one-year
lease
renewal
as
a
record.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
and
went
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
actionable
damages
and
utilized
the
doctrine
of
consent
and
ruled
that
when
a
dealer
entered
into
the
lease
consignment
structure
of
union
oil
company
with
his
eyes
wide
open,
he
knew
he
is
going
to
have
to
sign
this
agreement
that
he
could
not
thereafter
obtain
damages
because
he
had
full
knowledge
and
he
walked
into
the
scheme
with
his
eyes
wide
open.
and
it
also
applied
the
same
doctrine
of
consent
to
the
secondary
aspect
of
the
plaintiff's
case
which
was
claiming
that
prices
were
fixed
during
the
period
of
in-station
occupancy
pursuant
to
coercive
program,
which
was
structured
upon
lease
renewal,
and
there
upon
the
dealer
suffered
injurious
price
fixing
orders
for
which
he
could
be
compensated
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
and
as
to
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
when
the
state
of
the
record
shows
that
the
dealer
does
in
fact
charge
his
own
price
and
raises
the
conflict
of
facts
between
the
supplier
and
the
dealer
that
he
cannot
thereafter
sue
for
in-station
damages
because
in
fact
he
could
charge
his
own
prices.
the
only
theory
was
that
he
had
--
he
couldn't
get
the
station
the
next
year,
although
he
had
expended
substantial
money
for
the
service
station
business.
mr.
maxwell
keith
it
was
two
one-year
leases
and
the
order
came
in
--
the
letter
of
non-renewal
came
in
one
month
before
the
lease
was
to
terminate.
mr.
maxwell
keith
he
--
i
think
the
record
will
be
undisputed
that
he
was
to
charge
on
the
regular
type
of
gasoline
29.9
that
his
competitors
--
his
three
immediate
competitors
were
charging
27.9
that
he
asked
the
respondent's
agents
to
meet
this
price
and
that
he
was
refused
and
that
thereafter
he
set
it
at
27.9.
mr.
maxwell
keith
and
that's
what
precipitated
this
matter.
so
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
consent,
a
court
doctrine
has
application
to
a
section
4
action
based
upon
lease,
non-renewal
or
lease
cancelation
when
the
dealer
did
have
knowledge
of
the
consignment
program
of
the
respondent.
now
i
think
there
should
be
a
distinction
made
here
that's
important
and
that
is
whether
or
not
assuming
that
a
consent
doctrine
can
be
applied,
which
i
allege
cannot
be,
whether
or
not
that
can
be
made
in
summary
judgment
because
the
consent
even
in
classical
tort
doctrine
has
usually
been
an
affirmative
defense
and
has
been
raised
only
upon
the
factual
showing
at
a
trial.
now
here
the
doctrine
was
applied
in
a
summary
judgment
situation
and
here
it
was
applied
when
the
record
clearly
showed
protest
by
the
petitioner
against
the
orders
of
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
here.
now
my
motion
for
a
partial
summary
judgment
is
based
upon
stipulations
and
i
believe
positive
and
unrefutable
proof
in
the
record,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
finding
the
fact
based
upon
stipulation
that
lease
non-renewal
has
been
used
and
will
be
used
in
order
to
regiment
a
price
fixed
organization.
and
i
urge
that
this
stipulation
constitutes
violations
of
both
sections
1
and
sections
2
of
the
sherman
act.
another
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
we
are
talking
about
consignment
or
we
are
talking
about
resale
price
fixing
because
i
urge
upon
the
court
that
we
don't
have
a
consignment
agreement
here
at
all.
what
we
have
here
is
a
resale
price
fixing
agreement.
then
we
have
a
last
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
plaintiff's
right
to
trial
by
jury
has
been
violated
in
view
of
the
fact
that
counsel
at
all
times
herein
in
his
moving
papers
attempted
to
preserve
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
for
the
plaintiff
below.
as
heretofore
indicated,
the
petitioner
is
a
service
station
dealer
and
he
obtained
one
of
the
best
available
sites
that
union
oil
company
had
in
its
chain
in
may
of
1956.
he
had
been
employed
by
the
company
and
upon
the
termination
of
his
employment,
he
was
offered
by
his
agents
his
choice
of
the
best
available
site
of
the
chain
and
he
picked
a
very
good
service
station
site
in
fresno
where
he
had
a
relative.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
think
it
was
–
i
am
really
not
too
sure
of
that,
but
i
believe
it
was
a
new
station
that
was
available
at
that
time.
the
petitioner
in
order
to
obtain
this
service
station
site
was
handed
his
one-year
lease,
was
handed
his
retail
dealer
consignment
agreement,
which
he
signed.
and
also
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
station
he
was
required
to
spend
approximately
$3500
of
his
own
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
equipment
and
supplies
to
run
that
service
station
business.
he
was
--
at
the
end
of
the
year,
as
is
customary,
he
was
given
another
one-year
lease.
the
record
shows
that
that
time
protested
consignment
and
he
did
take
the
lease
and
continued
to
be
a
so
called
consignment
operator
during
the
remainder
of
that
one-year
period.
the
respondent,
union
oil
company
of
california,
is
one
of
the
largest
of
the
seven
major
fully
integrated
oil
companies
on
the
west
coast.
it
explores
for
oil.
it
refines
oil
into
petroleum.
it
distributes
and
retails
petroleum
products.
the
record
shows
and
the
complaint
alleged
that
in
addition
to
supplying
retailers
under
the
banner
of
union
oil
company,
it
distributes
substantial
quantities
of
its
refined
petroleum
products
to
so-called
off
brand
service
stations
who
will
sell
this
gasoline
of
union
oil
company
under
different
trade
name.
and
i
think
the
record
also
shows
by
way
of
depositions
that
i
had
taken
that
these
off
brand
companies
attempt
to
sell
their
gasoline
at
$0.01
or
$0.02
below
the
established
price
that
the
majors
have,
the
fully
integrated
companies.
around
1954,
the
later
part
of
1954,
the
defendant
promulgated
its
retail
dealer
price
fixing
consignment
program
and
the
ostensible
and
the
written
purpose
was
in
order
to
control
prices.
and
the
letters
from
the
general
sales
manager
say
to
the
people
in
the
field
that
these
agreements
are
to
be
used
when
we
want
to
control
prices
in
a
price
war
situation.
that
when
the
price
war
situation
is
over,
the
dealers
will
go
off,
consignment
will
put
them
back
to
purchase
and
sales,
that's
in
the
beginning
of
the
program.
respondent
points
out
that
around
may
of
1955
that
a
change
was
made
and
that
the
respondent
company
attempted
to
make
the
consignment
program
a
permanent
measure
and
not
one
that
was
to
be
temporarily
used
in
a
price
war
situation,
but
you'll
notice
in
the
record,
“the
statement
continued
we
will
use
consignment
when
we
want
to
control
retail
pricing.”
now
we
have
established
the
policy
of
the
one-year
lease
and
the
policy
of
the
tie-in.
the
affect
of
this
tie-in
policy
was
to
establish
uniform
and
non
competitive
prices
in
the
eight
western
states
as
far
as
union
oil
company
was
concerned
and
its
three
thousand
dealers
under
the
consignment
program.
because
the
orders
were
in
the
beginning
charged
one
or
two
cents
over
your
major
competitors,
and
by
major
they
are
referring
to
the
fully
integrated
majors,
later
the
orders
were
charged
the
same
as
the
predominant
major
price
which
is
the
major
oil
companies
or
charged
what
standard
stations,
inc.,
charges,
whichever
is
the
lower
price.
and
these
were
the
prices
that
were
established
in
the
policy
letters,
uniform
prices
based
upon
what
standard
station
was
charging.
now
we
know
that
those
prices
were
regimented
under
the
threat
of
non-renewal
of
these
one-year
leases
not
only
by
reason
of
the
stipulation
of
counsel,
but
by
reason
of
the
record,
which
shows
a
letter
that
states
that
we
will
refuse
–
“we
will
review
rather
all
the
dealers
who
have
not
agreed
to
our
consignment
program
even
to
the
extent
of
losing
the
business.”
and
we
know
when
changes
were
made
in
the
consignment
program,
in
the
consignment
agreement
itself,
the
orders
were,
“those
dealers
who
do
not
agree
to
sign
or
subscribe
to
the
new
agreement,
we
will
send
him
a
letter
of
cancellation
and
when
that
letter
--
when
the
time
of
cancellation
has
expired,
we
will
then
give
him
the
new
agreement
to
be
signed
and
subscribed.”
the
obvious
inference
is
if
he
doesn't
sign
or
subscribe
it,
his
lease
is
not
going
to
be
renewed.
now
the
retail
dealer
consignment
agreement
itself
places
virtually
all
the
risk
of
the
business
on
the
dealer,
just
as
the
lease
does.
he
is
responsible
to
his
employees,
and
union
oil
has
no
responsibility
insofar
as
the
employees
of
the
dealer
are
concerned.
he
is
responsible
for
all
the
business
fees
and
the
license
fees
and
all
the
taxes
except
the
reserved
property
taxes
which
union
oil
claims
to
pay.
then
all
the
risks
of
property
damage,
personal
injury
liability
are
placed
right
on
the
dealer.
the
only
insurable
risk
that
the
respondent
claims
to
cover
are
those
caused
by
natural
catastrophe,
that
if
there
is
leakage
in
the
pumps
or
if
a
car
runs
amuck
and
knocks
a
pump
over
and
a
gasoline
is
spilled,
or
if
there
is
theft
that
the
dealer
will
carry
the
burdens
of
that
kind
of
loss
and
not
union
oil
company.
now
the
agreement
of
course
expressively
provides
union
shall
fix
the
price
of
gasoline
and
it
does
so,
on
the
assumed
basis
that
it
is
giving
the
dealers
a
commission
upon
the
sale
of
the
gasoline.
now
this
commission
when
it
first
came
out
was
very
much
equivalent
to
margin.
now
the
commission
was
simply
the
base
--
the
difference
between
the
authorized
consignment
price,
which
is
a
retail
price,
and
the
union
oil
company's
tank
wagon
price
or
the
wholesale
price.
however,
the
agreement
provided
that
a
commission
would
be
guaranteed,
and
that
will
be
the
6.5
or
5.5
before
rent.
there's
some
dispute
as
to
which
figure
was
to
be
used,
which
was
to
be
guaranteed.
later
a
change
was
made
so
that
the
consignment
agreement
provided
that
the
dealer
would
assume
50%,
one
half
of
the
difference
between
the
authorized
consignment
price
and
a
so
called
normal
retail
price
when
the
consignment
price
went
below
this
normal
retail
price.
then
in
march
of
1958,
in
a
letter
written
by
respondent's
general
sales
manager,
“in
order
to
be
on
the
same
basis
as
purchase
and
sale
of
the
company
and
in
order
to
have
the
dealer
participate
in
price
decline,
the
respondent
union
oil
company
determined
to
have
the
dealer
absorb
20%
of
the
decline
in
prices”
and
no
more
guaranteed
commissions.
what
they
did
do
is
they
sent
a
letter
to
the
dealer
saying
we
are
going
on
this
new
program,
you
will
have
a
commission
guaranteed,
however
we
reserve
the
right
to
cancel
this
letter
at
any
time.
and
as
you
study
the
sliding
scales
of
the
respondent
in
march
of
1958,
you
will
see
that
they
are
all
based
upon
a
20%
participation
of
a
price
decline,
and
whereas
in
the
old
days
the
5.5
or
the
6
cents
was
there,
in
the
new
sliding
scale
they
go
down
to
3.5
cents
commission.
i
have
touched
upon
the
facts
relating
to
the
cancellation
of
the
plaintiff
for
the
non-renewal
of
his
one-year
lease.
the
fact
that
he
was
attempting
to
meet
a
market
situation
that
he
asked
to
be
able
to
meet
this
that
he
was
refused.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
answer
or
the
complaint
first
alleged
that
plaintiff
was
threatened
with
lease
cancellation
quietly
by
agents.
and
the
answer
in
effect
admits
that
an
agent
of
the
union
oil
company
came
to
petitioner's
service
station
and
told
him
that
they
could
do
what
they
could
--
would
do
in
order
to
raise
the
price
of
petitioner.
now
the
deposition
of
the
petitioner
says
that
the
agent,
a
district
manager,
mr.
kirkberg,
came
marching
in
and
said,
“you
had
better
raise
those
prices
and
unless
you
do,
i
am
going
to
call
mr.
raff
in
los
angeles
and
we
will
use
the
full
power
of
union
oil
company
to
make
you
raise
those
prices.”
mr.
simpson
held
on
to
his
27.9
price
and
a
short
time
later
he
was
told
that
his
lease
will
not
be
renewed.
this,
however,
was
not
the
full
end
of
the
story
because
mr.
simpson
had
spent
16
hours
a
day
for
about
two
years
at
that
station
and
he
didn't
want
to
give
up
and
so
then
the
lease
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
don't
think
he
did
well
that
money.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
profit
and
loss
figures
are
in
the
record.
that
would
be
his
profit
figures
in
march
and
i
believe
they
show
a
profit
of
$266
for
march
1958.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
that's
on
the
--
that's
in
the
profit
on
the
station.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
believe
that
the
record
would
not
indicate
that
at
this
stage
of
proceedings
your
honor.
mr.
maxwell
keith
this
particular
change
i
don't
think
affected
mr.
simpson
in
that
month.
this
program
was
to
be
affected
beginning
the
march
of
1958
and
the
record
is
uncertain
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
--
whether
that
particular
program
reached
simpson
and
i
doubt
that
it
did.
he
was
still
operating
on
this
old
arrangement
of
the
50%
situation
with
the
guaranteed
commission.
what
happened
all
these
delivery
tickets,
gasoline
delivery
tickets,
were
submitted
to
the
respondent
and
they
were
attached
to
the
deposition
that
they
were
not
put
in
the
record
as
part
of
appellate
record.
but
we
do
have
that
in
the
record
below
those
gasoline
delivery
tickets
were
submitted
to
the
respondent
and
they
were
attached
to
the
deposition,
but
they
were
not
put
in
the
record
as
part
of
the
appellate
record,
but
we
do
have
that
in
the
record
below
those
gasoline
delivery
tickets.
mr.
simpson
attempted
to
convince
someone
in
the
union
oil
organization
that
a
wrong
had
been
made,
and
a
wrong
was
to
be
done
and
he
urged
his
customers
to
send
letters
of
protest
to
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
union
oil
company.
and
mr.
simpson
apparently
obtained
230
customers
to
support
his
campaign
to
keep
his
service
station,
but
this
was
not
going
to
change
anybody's
mind.
as
a
matter
of
fact
just
the
opposite
occurred.
the
general
sales
manager
mr.
rath
was
dispatched
to
fresno
and
he
told
mr.
simpson
that
he
understood,
that
he
didn't
want
to
leave
the
station,
and
he
advised
mr.
simpson
that
union
oil
was
going
to
have
to
make
him
leave
that
station.
he
told
him
about
a
story
about
two
dealers
that
had
been
--
had
to
be
bodily
turned
out
of
the
station
and
he
told
mr.
simpson
that
he
doesn't
have
much
money
and
he
better
not
try
and
tangle
with
the
power
of
the
union
oil
company
and
the
threat
was
made
good.
he
obtained
temporary
restraining
order
for
approximately
five
days.
on
argument
that
was
canceled,
no
preliminary
injunction
was
granted
and
mr.
simpson
left
the
service
station
and
it
has
been
in
the
hands
of
another
person
ever
since.
and
it's
interesting
also
to
show
that
the
--
at
the
time
of
this,
desire
to
have
simpson
keep
his
prices
up,
there
were
apparently
conversations
between
the
union
oil
company,
representatives
of
the
(inaudible)
company
with
respect
to
retail
prices.
i
think
the
inference
is
pretty
clear,
that
there
was
a
situation
were
prices
were
to
go
up
on
ventura
avenue
in
fresno.
now
the
district
court
on
argument,
both
the
summary
judgment
and
the
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
ruled
that
the
consignment
program
was
valid
and
that
dr.
miles
and
parke
davis
did
not
affect
a
consignment
situation.
in
fact
saying
that
by
consignment
you
can
do
what
you
can
do
by
the
way
resale
price
fixing.
it
also
ruled
there
were
no
actionable
damages
and
that
the
damages
were
speculative
and
uncertain.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
go
with
the
district
court
on
the
issue
of
validity.
instead
it
set
forth
what
it
felt
were
issues
of
fact
and
then
it
announced
that
the
doctrine
of
consent
would
bar
recovery
in
this
situation
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
between
two
kinds
of
dealers.
the
dealers
who
are
on
the
station
at
the
time
of
the
retail
dealer
consignment
agreement
program
was
originated,
and
it
said
as
to
these
dealers
there
was
real
--
there
might
be
real
coercion
and
they
might
have
an
action
because
they
in
order
to
keep
their
station
they
might
have
to
sign
this
agreement
against
their
will,
but
the
courts
of
appeals
did
not
see
anything
that
would
match
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
a
situation
where
you
are
told
in
order
to
lease
the
station,
you
must
sign
the
consignment
agreement.
although
i
think
that
in
the
description
of
tie-in
by
this
court
that
this
court
does
use
the
word
coercion
in
describing
a
tie-in
situation
or
in
order
to
obtain
a
desired
commodity,
a
purchaser
is
required
to
buy
another
commodity.
mr.
maxwell
keith
yes
he
gets
a
guaranteed
commission,
which
is
very
much
equivalent
to
the
margin
which
a
resale
dealer
obtains,
the
difference
between
the
tank
wagon
price
and
the
resale
price.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that's
right
unless
of
course
the
orders
were
to
price
yourself
above
your
competition
and
then
you
are
not
going
to
get
any
commission
because
presumably
you
are
not
going
to
be
selling
any
gasoline
if
you
are
$0.02
above
everybody
around
you
and
the
commission
is
based
upon
the
gallons
sold.
so
that
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
you
will
have
that
guaranteed
commission.
however,
i
think
as
matter
of
reality
there
isn't
too
much
of
a
distinction
between
this
kind
of
a
guaranteed
commission
policy
and
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
court
faced
in
the
standard
oil
case
where
attempts
are
made
to
give
the
dealer
some
kind
of
a
dealer
aid
or
some
kind
of
a
subsidy.
in
each
case,
the
companies
don't
drop
their
wholesale
price.
now
where
do
they
know
that
these
dealers
are
in
a
heavy
competitive
battle
and
they
hold
that
price
up
and
they
come
up
with
some
other,
which
i
think
we
can
call
a
gimmick
or
a
scheme
to
subsidize
the
dealer
who
is
facing
the
price
war
situation.
mr.
maxwell
keith
to
a
particular
dealer
and
we
are
talking
about
across
the
board
price
reduction
to
all
accounts
who
are
in
the
competitive
--
in
competition
with
each
other.
now
it
is
urged
that
the
principle
of
law
used
by
the
court
below
is
not
applicable
to
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
statute
as
doctrine
of
consent
was
not
supported
below
by
any
decision
of
this
court.
and
if
we
analyze
the
facts
in
the
southern
photo
material
case
and
the
emich
case,
moore
versus
mead,
we
find
there
plaintiffs
who
had
full
knowledge,
their
eyes
were
wide
open,
they
dealt
with
a
violator
and
as
soon
as
the
plaintiff
attempted
to
rid
himself
of
the
injurious
impact
of
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
he
was
threatened
with
action
unless
he
followed
out
the
illegal
scheme
and
carried
it
out,
we
find
that
a
treble
damage
action
has
been
sustained
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
in
story
--
in
the
southern
photo
material
case
the
plaintiff
had
dealt
with
the
eastman
kodak
company
and
had
subscribed
to
it
resale
price
fixing
provisions,
but
then
a
dispute
arose
as
to
selling
the
business
to
the
kodak
company
and
there
was
a
dispute
and
pursuant
to
a
plan
to
monopolize
the
eastman
kodak
company
withdrew
its
supplies
and
the
treble
damage
action
went
to
the
jury
with
instructions
upon
pari
delicto.
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiff,
of
course
this
court
sustained
the
jury
verdict.
in
emich
case
we
have
a
very
similar
kind
of
situation.
there
was
a
general
motors
dealer
being
forced
to
accept
financing
arrangements
by
the
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
the
dealer
emich
there
knew
at
the
time
that
he
obtained
the
papers
from
the
general
motors
company,
giving
him
the
rights
to
sell
the
cars,
that
they
had
a
financing
program
and
during
his
occupancy,
he
was
warned
to
continue
to
obtain
more
financing
through
general
motors.
and
of
course
his
franchise
was
terminated
and
this
court
sustained
the
action
although
the
particular
issue
before
the
court
was
the
effective
section
5
of
clayton
act.
then
the
moore
versus,
then
there
was
kiefer-stewart
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
did
not
immunize
the
defendants
for
the
liability
for
the
injurious
acts
they
committed
upon
the
plaintiff
and
then
in
the
moore
versus
meads
bakery
case
this
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
who
enters
into
unlawful
conduct
on
his
own
in
retaliation
for
the
unlawful
conduct
of
the
defendant,
thus
continues
to
have
a
cause
of
action
that
his
unlawful
conduct
does
not
give
the
defendant
any
immunity
even
though
the
plaintiff
enters
in
the
unlawful
conduct
with
full
knowledge
that
there
is
going
to
be
retaliation
by
the
defendant
against
him,
so
i
think.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well,
i
was
just
coming
to
that.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well
they
could
certainly
refuse
to
renew
a
lease
on
somebody
that
was
doing
something
that
the
ordinary
normal
reasonable
man
wouldn't
do
as
a
service
station
dealer.
mr.
maxwell
keith
yeah.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
believe
under
the
clayton
act
that
would
be
permissible
without
being
subjected
to
treble
damage
action.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
your
honor.
i
think
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
dealer
go
to
a
jury
on
the
question
of
he
having
a
weapon,
having
been
subject
to
a
weapon
or
a
clause.
now
this
case
i
believe
is
premised
on
the
question
of
coercion.
now
whether
or
not
a
company
can
issue
a
price
fixing
order
and
say
either
you
obey
that
order
or
you
are
going
to
lose
your
business.
now
i
think
that
is
the
central
issue
and
not
--
whether
or
not
this
is
a
valid
consignment
or
not.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
under
a
consignment
anymore
than
you
can
do
under
the
parke-davis.
you
can
suggest
prices,
you
can
tell
these
dealers
what
the
prices
ought
to
be
and
how
they
–
if
they
want
to
run
their
business
at
a
profit,
i
suppose
you
could
suggest
in
some
general
announcement
to
the
trade
but
the
moment
you
get
into
an
area
of
threats
and
the
weapons
i
don't
care
whether
it's
consignment
or
not,
whether
it's
a
valid
consignment
agreement
or
not
because
this
is
precisely
where
the
area
of
freedom
of
bargaining
breaks
down.
as
i
understand
the
distinctions
that
this
court
has
enunciated
through
the
parke-davis
and
the
beech-nut
and
the
colgate
decision
is
we
cannot
compel
the
application
of
price
judgments.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
i
think
what
i'm
really
saying
is
this.
assuming
this
is
a
valid
consignment
agreement
and
that
these
are
really
valid
consignees,
what
i'm
saying
the
minute
they
go
over
the
boundaries
of
the
agreement
and
they
adopt
means
which
are
either
illegal
per
se
or
they
have
adopt
means
which
are
beyond
this
court's
announcements
in
the
parke-davis
case,
in
effect
they
are
talking
about
resale
price
fixing
because
the
dealer
has
in
effect
advocated
it,
it's
his
consignment
status,
and
he
is
saying
i
want
renunciation
and
they
say
you
cannot
have
renunciation,
you
must
obey
our
price
and
i
think
certainly
one
of
the
standards
of
consignment
as
a
common
law
system
is
that
the
agent
is
always
free
to
abandon
a
consignment
program.
here
they
are
saying
you
can
only
renounce
under
a
fear
of
losing
your
business.
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
and
not
whether
or
not
this
is
really
consignment
or
not.
mr.
maxwell
keith
if
the
cancelation
is
stipulated
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
price
under
the
sherman
act
because
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
right.
well
i
would
say
that
the
moment
they
use
this
method
or
means,
they
are
not
enforcing
the
contractual
provision.
they
are
enforcing
rather
their
order
upon
a
dissenting
dealer.
mr.
maxwell
keith
just
as
parke-davis
indicates
you
make
an
announcement
to
the
trade,
you
can
indicate,
you
can
refuse
to
sell
supplies,
but
you
cannot
take
away
the
business
which
i
think
would
be
the
distinction.
under
parke-davis
you
announced
that
a
supplier
could
refuse
the
dealer,
as
a
part
of
a
suggested
price
fixing
program,
but
that's
all
and
no
more
and
the
minute
the
supplier
goes
beyond
the
refusal
of
the
supplies
and
adopts
methods
or
means
which
compel
that
he
adheres
to
a
price
fix
order
that
it's
going
beyond
the
colgate
case
and
i
guess
that's
where
we
are,
it's
a
colgate
case.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
would
say
they
are
compelled
to
give
you
a
lease
unless
they
have
some
other
reason
other
than
the
price
fixing
reasons
because
then
they
are
subject
to
the
charge
that
they
are
regimenting
a
dealer
organization.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well
now
this
question
was
examined
in
this
case
of
osborn
versus
sinclair
refining
company
on
the
tba
situation
where
the
fourth
circuit
announced
that
a
single
supplier
did
not
have
protection
under
colgate
to
coerce
an
arrangement
in
restraint
of
trade.
and
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
approached
it
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
one-year
lease,
it
had
another
--
it
went
from
year-to-year
that
at
least
the
dealer
would
have
had
it
for
an
additional
year
and
it
based
damages
upon
one-year
occupancy.
i
had
urged
or
have
urged
that
this
is
a
question
for
a
jury,
in
the
ordinary
situation
it
goes
to
damages,
you
present
all
your
available
data,
how
long
would
the
dealer
have
stayed
in
because
in
this
case
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
rath,
the
president
of
union
oil
company,
later
the
chairman
of
the
board
that
they
continually
give
leases.
now
it's
clearly
the
jury
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
have
that
kind
of
evidence
and
is
going
to
be
--
have
available
towards
the
evidence
of
the
respondent
that
for
some
other
reasons
we
could
have
cancelled
this
man
and
let
the
jury
decide
how
long.
but
we
know
dealers,
under
mr.
rath's
testimony,
have
been
in
the
station
15
to
20
years.
we
know
that
advertisement
of
union
oil
boast
of
this
fact
that
if
you
are
a
union
leader
you
are
going
to
have
a
long
time
occupancy
and
you
are
going
to
be
a
respected
businessman
making
profit
and
loss
of
your
own.
now
i
urge
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
masonite
case
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
is
consignment
or
resale
price
fixing
that
the
terms
of
an
agreement
are
not
going
to
hide
the
basic
anti-trust
restraining
effects
of
a
program
from
the
court.
if
we
are
going
to
go
behind
the
façade,
we
are
going
to
see
does
this
restrain
trade
the
scheme,
does
it
regiment,
does
it
create
in
effect
a
price
fixing
combination
and
if
it
does,
it's
going
to
be
held
in
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
regardless
of
whether
or
not
you
have
a
common
law
agency
or
you
are
a
common
law
consignment
arrangement.
and
i
also
urge
that
even
if
masonite
doesn't
apply
we
clearly
have
a
limited
dispensation
of
colgate
that
colgate
does
not
in
anywise
allow
dealer
or
a
supplier
to
utilize
a
refusal
to
sell
in
order
to
perpetuate
a
price
fixing
program.
we
do
have
--
we
do
know
this
in
the
record.
there
is
a
letter
that's
signed
by
the
agent
of
union
oil
company
that
we
are
going
to
police
prices
and
we
know
from
the
record
here
the
extend
which
prices
were
policed,
we
know
that
agents
do
go
on
the
premises,
do
talk
to
these
dealers
and
do
utilize
the
threat
of
the
cancellation
in
order
to
carryout
this
scheme.
i
also
urge
upon
the
court,
a
violation
of
section
2
that
these
are
predatory
weapons
that
you
do
not
use
under
colgate
the
power
of
lease
cancellation
in
order
to
perpetuate
a
price
fixing
program
and
that
the
use
of
these
weapons
is
a
section
2
violation
and
it
shows
a
specific
intent
to
monopolize
that
these
dealers
are
independent
businessmen,
they
invest
their
personal
fortunes
to
go
into
the
business
and
they
are
to
be
free
of
this
kind
of
a
plan
to
control
not
only
their
judgments
as
to
prices
but
their
judgments
as
to
gasoline
products.
and
i
would
urge
that
the
court
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
in
order
that
the
question
of
findings
as
fact
on
the
use
of
lease
cancellation
as
a
weapon
maybe
settled
in
view
of
the
stipulations
of
the
counsel
for
respondent
and
i
would
urge
that
at
any
rate
the
case
be
remanded
for
a
jury
trail
on
all
issues.
and
i
would
like
to
urge
on
this
question
of
consignment
as
such
that
the
dealers
were
required
to
sustain
a
substantial
portion
of
price
declines,
the
risks
of
insurance
were
on
the
dealers,
the
risks
of
loss
or
theft
were
on
the
dealers
that
in
the
general
electric
case
when
this
court
sustained
the
general
electric
consignment
program,
this
seemed
to
be
the
very
ratio
decidendi
of
the
opinion
that
the
company
assume
all
the
risks.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
in
the
consignment
agreement
of
the
union
oil
company
especially
as
it
was
modified
to
require
the
dealers
to
observe
price
declines
that
these
risks
were
placed
upon
the
dealers
and
therefore
that
we
have
in
fact
a
resale
price
fixing
agreement.
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
think
under
the
per
se
announcements
of
this
court,
the
white
motor
case
that
when
a
company
--
i
think
combination
of
moore
versus
mead
and
white
motor
that
if
an
interstate
oil
company
compels
the
acceptance
of
a
price
order
that
you
would
have
a
section
4
action.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well,
i
have
not
taken
that
position.
i
have
attacked
this
as
a
total
regimented
system
in
which
all
the
dealers
are
treated
in
this
manner
of
being
compelled
to
sign
the
price
fixing
agreement
in
order
to
get
the
station,
that's
stipulated
here
and
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
this
was
a
vast
pricing
scheme
in
the
interstate
commerce
which
is
applicable
to
3000
dealers.
i
think
the
--
i
have
not
placed
the
case
in
the
posture
that
mr.
justice
white
indicates,
but
i
do
think
i
could
based
upon
moore
versus
mead
that
if
an
interstate
company
utilizes
unlawful
means,
it
maybe
subject
to
section
4
of
clayton
act,
by
action
by
an
injured
single
individual.
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
call
for
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
late
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
service
station
case
called
paul
lessig
versus
tidewater
oil
company,
which
was
issued
january
2nd
1964.
mr.
maxwell
keith
paul
lessig
versus
tidewater
oil
company.
mr.
maxwell
keith
l
e
s
s
i
g,
versus
the
tidewater
oil
company,
which
is
similar
to
osborn
case
in
holding
that
colgate
does
not
allow
an
oil
company
to
use
the
lease
cancellation
as
a
device
to
require
the
dealer
to
subscribe
to
orders
which
restrain
trade.
mr.
maxwell
keith
it's
--
there
is
no
citation,
it's
slip
opinion
that
came
out
january
2nd,
it's
numbered
17924,
1924,
the
case
was
argued
by
this
counsel
and
mr.
lasky
was
the
attorney.
mr.
maxwell
keith
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
key
phrase
before
the
court
is
in
restraint
of
trade.
i
think
it
is
clear
throughout
the
decided
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
central
question
is
purpose
and
effect,
regardless
of
the
form
that
is
used,
and
this
is
to
carry
out
congressional
purpose
that
any
form,
any
scheme,
any
device
that
restrains
trade
and
cripples
the
liberty
of
individuals,
is
contrary
to
congressional
statute.
the
purpose
here
was
not
to
arrive
at
some
form
of
business
relationship
in
order
to
give
the
dealers
all
that
union
could.
the
purpose
is
in
the
record,
it
was
to
control
prices
in
a
price
war
situation.
the
original
thought
here
was
that
when
the
price
war
broke
and
ended
that
the
consignment
relationship
would
be
ended
and
the
dealers
will
be
put
back
on
purchase
and
sale.
later
this
was
changed
to
make
consignment
a
means
to
control
prices,
because
the
price
war
market
was
never
--
had
never
ended
and
price
wars
continued
throughout
this
period
of
time
because
of
economic
reasons.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
effect
is
clear.
there
is
a
document
in
the
record
explaining
how
this
plan
was
to
work.
under
statutory
scheme
you
have
to
have
uniform
prices.
under
this
consignment
arrangement
union
oil
wanted
to
control
prices
at
individual
service
stations
without
regard
to
a
uniform
price,
which
is
a
requirement
of
statutory
scheme
and
of
course
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
mckesson
&
robbins
either
you
follow
the
statutory
scheme
or
you’re
in
per
se
violation
of
the
act.
now
256,
it
says
we
are
going
to
end
zoning
pricing
and
we
are
going
to
where
you
find
it
necessary
to
partially
meet,
cut
price
activity
in
the
part
of
our
major
competition
the
retail
price
maybe
set
for
any
service
station
handling
our
products
under
our
consignment
agreement
at
$0.01
per
gallon
over
the
price
of
house-brand
gas
of
a
major
competitor
that
is
posted
at
the
major
station
inside
of
our
service
station.
in
other
words,
pricing
is
to
be
based
upon
what
can
been
seen
by
a
representative
of
united
oil
company
as
he
tours
the
area
and
that
is
going
to
be
a
different
price,
then
he
cannot,
then
the
service
stations
that
he
cannot
see,
in
other
words
you
might
have
a
distance
of
five
blocks
and
you
have
various
prices.
now
of
course
this
is
beyond
the
scope
of
any
fair
trade
scheme.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
fair
trade
under
statutory
a
scheme
is
limited
to
a
uniform
price,
that
is
established
for
the
trade.
in
other
words,
when
you
enter
into
fair
trade
program
you
tell
the
dealer
we
have
a
fair
trade
price
and
this
is
to
be
followed
and
the
expectation
is
that
every
other
dealer
is
going
to
charge
that
same
price.
now
they
have
an
inside
price
program.
in
other
words,
prices
are
going
to
vary
within
a
few
blocks
of
each
other.
now
this
is
beyond,
as
i
understand
a
fair
trade,
beyond
statutory
purpose.
mr.
maxwell
keith
yes
in
fresno,
we’ll
find
maybe
15
different
prices
in
fresno
in
a
price
war
situation
in
the
city.
we
have
that
all
documented.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no,
under
--
if
they
had
a
fair
trade
program,
virtually
every
dealer
in
fresno
will
be
charging
the
same
price.
the
statutory
scheme
is
a
uniform
price
designed
to
protect
the
trademark.
in
other
words,
we
--
the
argument
for
fair
trade
and
the
statutory
--
and
the
sanction
of
it
by
the
courts
is
that
as
a
trademark
owner,
we
don’t
want
to
have
various
prices,
we
don’t
want
to
have
the
public
think
in
terms
of
other
than
what
price
we
establish,
so
that
they
have
a
uniform
price
to
the
public.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
i
would
urge
that
mckesson
&
robbins
would
preclude
that
because
the
answer,
record
91
says
we
went
off
fair
trade,
we
were
on
fair
trade
and
then
we
went
off,
and
they
use
consignment
as
the
way
of
fixing
price.
now
if
you
don’t
have
one
single
dealer
in
the
state
knowing
about
fair
trade,
you
cannot
have
a
fair
trade
statute
as
a
protection,
as
i
understand
the
mckesson
&
robbins
decision.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
ge
case
of
course
is
not
the
last
word
in
consignment.
the
last
word
is
masonite
from
this
court
and
the
last
word
is
the
atlantic
refining
company
case
from
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well
i
--
of
course
i.
mr.
maxwell
keith
well
if
the
government
did
attack
consignment,
then
it
has
now
established
in
two
cases,
the
atlantic
refining
case
and
the
sun
oil
case
that
consignment
cannot
be
used
as
to
means
to
control
prices
in
a
price
war
situation.
so
that
the
government
has
gone
into
this
area
and
has
ruled
against
the
basic
argument
here,
the
consignment
is
some
sort
of
a
magic
wand
that
protects
price
fixing.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no.
there’s
another
sun
oil
case
your
honor,
the
federal
trade
commission
versus
sun
oil
which
was
decided
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
may
of
1963
and
there
it
has
held
that
under
masonite
when
we
have
an
obvious
scheme
to
control
prices.
the
facade
of
consignment
is
not
going
to
protect
the
oil
companies,
that
they
have
to
really
effectuate
a
true
consignment
situation
which
was
not
favorable
--
was
not
before
them.
mr.
maxwell
keith
pardon
me.
mr.
maxwell
keith
this
court
has
not
held
--
has
not
had
a
gasoline
stations
consignment
program
before.
however,
in
masonite
it
said
that
the
form
that
is
used
is
not
determinative,
that
masonite
you
will
assume
that
there
was
a
valid
agency
relationship,
creditor-agency
relationship
and
that
the
essential
question
is
one
of
purpose
and
effect
and
that
if
the
scheme
or
the
device
restrains
interstate
trade
and
commerce
under
congressional
statute,
that
the
scheme
must
be
stricken.
now
i
submit
that
what
union
oil
here
is
trying
to
do
is
get
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds.
it
is
trying
to
have
independent
businessmen
and
control
their
prices
as
though
they
were
their
employees
and
yet
it
is
not
willing
to
treat
them
as
employees
and
respond
to
state
legislation
with
respect
to
employees,
workmen
compensation,
unemployment
insurance,
social
security
and
of
course
the
federal
nlrb
statutes
would
interfere
if
these
were
agents.
so
it’s
trying
to
get
the
best
and
i
submit
that
under
the
sherman
act,
if
these
agents
or
these
dealers
are
independent
businessmen
by
a
lease
of
union
oil’s
own
creation,
and
that
you
cannot
lease
on
condition
that
prices
be
fixed.
mr.
maxwell
keith
of
course
i
have
argued
yesterday
that
the
crux
of
this
case
is
the
means
that
are
used,
that
you
cannot
utilize
a
short-term
lease,
plan
to
use
a
short-term
lease
as
a
means
of
controlling
prices
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a
means
that
the
court
stated
in
parke-davis
could
not
be
used,
this
not
simple
refusal
to
sell
supplies.
this
is
a
destruction
of
a
business
that
has
been
built-up
by
hard
work
and
many
hours
of
work
each
day.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
fourth
circuit
has
answered
that
in
the
osborn
case,
that
you
cannot
use
refusal
to
deal
to
form
an
arrangement
of
the
type
that
is
forbidden
by
the
sherman
act,
that
is
price
fixing,
exclusive
dealing
and
tie-in.
mr.
maxwell
keith
even
though
it’s
unilateral,
you
cannot
use
this
unilateral
refusal
deal
to
establish
the
type
or
a
kind
of
restraint
that
is
traditionally
prohibited
by
sherman
act
litigation.
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
i
think
that
the
courts
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
no
it’s
a
question
of
unlawful
purpose.
now
if
the
court
is
faced
with
an
unlawful
purpose
then
colgate
cannot
be
used
as
defense
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
before
circuit
in
osborn
pointed
out
that,
that
colgate
is
a
defense
usually
in
a
conspiracy
case
and
it
is
not
to
be
used
as
a
defense
when
you
are
talking
about
damages
which
flow
from
an
illegal
restraint
or
you
talk
about
the
use
of
the
refusal
to
deal
to
perpetuate
in
unlawful
kinds
of
conduct.
mr.
maxwell
keith
your
honor
i
submitted
to
the
court
statements
and
summary
judgment
claiming
there
was
a
conspiracy,
that
the
effect
of
this
arrangement
was
to
establish
a
combination
between
the
dealers
and
union
oil
company
and
the
court
at
record
350
acknowledges
this,
he
said
i
did
interject
object
conspiracy
in
for
the
record.
i
think
this
is
the
question
of
legal
words.
you
have
a
scheme
here.
the
effect
of
the
scheme,
the
legal
contemplation
is
a
combination
between
the
dealers
and
union
oil
company
to
fix
noncompetitive
prices,
of
course
that
is
effect.
but
as
i
read
dr.
miles
i
understood
the
court
to
say
that
the
system
of
contracts,
written
contracts
which
bind
parties
to
charge
a
supplier’s
price
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
supplier
and
that
it
was
basing
it
as
a
matter
of
voidness
to
common
law
and
under
the
sherman
act,
and
that
in
effect
the
company
was
creating
a
combination,
i
urge
this
to
the
court
below
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
i
urge
that
to
the
court
below,
yes
sir.
mr.
maxwell
keith
my
main
bow
was
the
richfield
oil
case
that
you
cannot
use
lease
cancellation
as
a
means
of
perpetuating
price
control.
mr.
maxwell
keith
that
is
the
inference
from
record
256
and
all
of
these
policy
letters
which
show
that
the
consignment
prices
are
to
be
based
upon
what
competition
charges,
either
standard
stations
or
major,
now
this
is
not
off
brand
competition
this
is
major
competition.
so
that
the
prices
will
vary
depending
upon
what
standard
station
charges
and
standard
station
charges
various
prices
within
the
single
zone
or
a
single
city.
so
there
was
no
attempt
here,
as
you
read
these
policy
letters,
i’ve
cited
those
references
in
my
reply
brief
at
page
16,
that’s
251.
mr.
maxwell
keith
256
yes
your
honor,
so
that
there
isn’t
any
attempt
to
follow
any
statutory
scheme
of
a
single
uniform
prices
here.
