whether
or
not
the
(inaudible)
california
law
insulates
the
kind
of
an
operation
you
got
hasn’t
been
determined
in
this
record,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had
never
been
an
issue
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
just
--
you
suggest
that
even
if
this
were
a
sale
and
a
resale
of
california
law
and
mcguire
insulate
it,
but
we
couldn’t
decide
that
here,
we
would
have
to
send
that
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
don’t
know
anything
about
--
this
isn’t
briefed
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
court
below
has
determined
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
facts
of
the
record
that
you
have
no
owned
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
union
has
none
of
its
own
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
going
back
again
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
sale
and
a
resale
or
equivalent
thereto,
you
then
said
that
now
you
might
be
in
some
trouble
if
this
were
a
resale
price
maintenance
fix,
and
assuming
no
insulation
from
california
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
that
--
on
such
assumptions
just
there
would
be
coercion,
i
mean
it
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
terminating
his
lease
because
he
won’t
live
up
to
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
the
issue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
fellow
is
still
you
would
argue
had
his
eyes
wide
open,
went
into
it
himself,
he
could
have
breached
the
contract
any
time
and
make
the
same
arguments
you
do
with
the
consignment.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
law
you
probably
would
have
had
a
lease
renewal?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fresno?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
characteristic
in
fair
trade
laws,
that
unless
you
get
the
protection
you
asked
for
(inaudible)
people
you
are
not
bound
legal?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
this
system
is
or
isn’t
protected
by
the
californian
regulation?
