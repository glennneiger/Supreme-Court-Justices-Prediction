j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
mr.
lasky
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
arrangement
tantamount
for
a
sale
–
for
resale
for
purposes
of
the
antitrust
law,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
it
comes
within
the
sections
if
that’s
what
they
are,
of
the
california
fair
trade
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
i
say
my
premise
was
that
it’s
the
equivalent
of
a
sale
--
the
resale
for
purposes
of
federal
antitrust
laws.
does
it
follow
that
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
california
fair
trade
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
parke-davis,
that
fact
now
that
a
refusal
to
deal
because
purchaser
wouldn’t
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
thought
you
were
arguing
this
on
the
premise
here
as
to
the
people
with
the
deal
would
be,
because
he
refused
to
sign
an
agreement
which
concededly
would
violate
the
antitrust
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
thought
parke-davis
at
that
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
surprised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
answer
mr.
lasky’s
article
assuming
this
is
a
(inaudible),
based
on
the
california
fair
trade
act
and
the
mcguire
act,
how
do
you
answer
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
parke-davis,
assuming
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
only
one
agreement
(inaudible)
as
a
unilateral
arrangement
between
union
and
simpson,
that
was
the
part
from
the
relations
with
other
dealers
