mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
proposition
which
mr.
anker
and
mr.
manoli
so
eloquently
espoused
here
is
really
one
of
extending
the
separate
gate
doctrine
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
general
electric,
and
as
applied
to
a
common-situs
property
owned
by
general
electric
to
a
secondary
employer
in
carrying
this
approach
to
its
logical
conclusion,
it
would
resolve
in
an
obliteration
of
the
8(b)(4)
protections
against
secondary
boycotts.
now,
before
i
address
myself
to
the
legal
principles
involved,
i
should
briefly
like
to
get
back
to
the
factual
circumstances.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
not
necessarily.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
carrier
corporation
in
syracuse
has
an
operation
with
some
eight
gates
for
use
of
employees
and
suppliers
surrounding
the
premises.
on
the
easterly
side
of
the
carrier
property,
the
spur
line
of
new
york
central
railroad
crosses
thompson
road.
thompson
road
is
in
north
south
highway,
about
35
feet
in
width.
the
gate,
as
has
been
noted
here,
granting
access
to
carrier,
to
western
electric,
to
general
electric,
to
brace-mueller-huntley
is
owned
by
the
new
york
central
railroad.
it
has
been
so
owned
for
11-years
prior
to
the
hearing
in
this
case.
the
key
to
the
gate
is
in
the
sole
possession
of
new
york
central
personnel.
carrier
employees
never
use
this
railroad
gate
for
ingress
or
egress
to
the
premises
and
to
their
work
places.
in
the
course
of
the
strike
which
occurred
in
1960,
in
march
1960,
the
steelworkers
union
picketed
the
railroad
gate.
and
significantly
your
honors,
not
only
the
railroad
gate
on
the
westside
of
thompson
road
but
also
picketed
on
the
eastside
of
the
road
removed
from
carrier
property
engaged
in
mass
picketing
there,
some
30
to
60
pickets
at
one
time,
they've
lay
down
on
the
railroad
tracks.
the
international
representative
of
the
union
drove
his
automobile
on
the
tracks
and
it
had
to
be
removed
by
the
police
officers.
one
of
the
pickets
threatened
the
supervisor
who
is
at
the
throttle
of
the
locomotive
and
invited
him
to
come
down
off
the
locomotive
for
the
purpose
of
getting
his
back
knocked
off
as
the
record
indicates.
the
trial
examiner
in
this
case
also
noted
that
three
track
links
of
new
york
central
right-of-way,
east
or
--
or
rather
west
of
the
road
of
thompson
road,
opposite
the
carrier
property
and
the
general
electric
and
the
western
electric
property
were
greased
during
this
incident.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
they
are
only,
mr.
justice
black
if
we
get
to
the
question
of
balancing
of
interest
here
which
argument
is
made
in
the
board
brief.
i
think
they're
quite
irrelevant
otherwise.
but
if
there
must
be
a
balancing
of
interest,
namely
the
interest
of
secondary
employers,
secondary
employees
if
you
will,
then
i
think
it's
highly
irrelevant
because
in
all
of
the
adjudicated
cases
including
general
electric,
there
was
nonviolent
picketing
and
the
court
made
special
note
of
this
fact.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no.
but
i
think
you
should
certainly
put
this
on
the
scales
if
you
get
to
the
question
of
balancing
interest
and
weigh
it
in
the
context
of
rights
of
a
union
striking
at
primary
premises
vis-Ã -vis
the
right
of
secondary
employees
and
employers
not
become
enmeshed
in
some
somebody
else's
labor
dispute.
well,
this
is
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
your
honor,
the
union
was
charged
with
this
conduct.
it
was
found
guilty
of
this
conduct
by
the
trial
examiner
of
the
nlrb.
it
is
found
guilty
by
the
board
before
the
case
came
up
for
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
union
stipulated
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law
and
it
agreed
to
post
the
customary
notices
so
that
this
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
--
fell
out
of
the
case.
it's
no
longer
an
issue
here
insofar
as
the
conduct
as
such
is
concerned.
well
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
these
were
the
circumstances
as
they
occurred
in
syracuse
on
march
11th
and
on
these
facts,
the
trial
examiner
initially
found
a
violation
of
section
8(b)(4)
because
as
he
put
it,
the
picketing
union
induced
railroad
employees
and
of
course
the
railroad,
to
not
handle
the
carrier
products
falling
within
the
prescription
of
8(b)(4)
single
(i)
and
double
(ii).
majority
of
the
board
reversed
the
second
circuit,
the
majority
of
the
second
circuit
reversed
the
board.
now,
we
are
here,
i
submit,
only
because
of
the
general
electric
decision
in
which
in
1961,
this
court
dealt
with
the
problem
of
a
reserved
gate
reserved
by
an
employer
at
primary
premises,
his
gate
if
he
will,
and
dealt
with
the
question
is
to
whether
or
no
it
was
appropriate
for
an
employer
to
reserves
such
a
gate
for
tradesmen,
secondary
employees,
not
engaged
in
the
normal
plant
operation
functions.
the
court
held,
the
majority
of
the
court,
that
if
indeed
the
gate
was
reserved
for
work
not
related
to
normal
plant
operation,
then
the
ingress
and
egress
at
that
gate
was
protected
and
under
section
8(b)(4),
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
--
to
seek
to
prevent
ingress
or
egress.
now,
the
nub
of
it,
if
the
court
please
is
the
fact
that
this
was
a
primary
premises
situation
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
secondary
employer,
secondary
premises
situation
involving
an
employer
here
at
the
new
york
central
engaged
in
its
normal
function
of
transporting
goods.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
agree
with
the
statement
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
if
it
were
a
carrier-owned
property
but
we
don't
come
to
that
question
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
ownership
of
the
property
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
secondary
employer
controlling
his
property.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
as
the
--
as
it's
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
association
of
american
railroads,
noted
perhaps
a
bit
plaintively,
the
right
of
ownership,
the
incidence
of
property
are
recognized
in
torts,
taxation,
property
law,
criminal
law
as
mr.
--
mr.
justice
stewart
noted.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
four.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
four.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
there
is
no
such
contention,
there
is
no
such
--
such
showing
and
our
position
is
simply
that
that
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
because
if
the
protection
of
the
statute,
if
8(b)(4)
applies
only
to
the
customers,
other
customers
of
the
railroad,
then
in
effect
we're
dealing
with
a
tertiary
situation
and
not
a
secondary.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
now,
on
the
question
of
the
applicable
law
contrary
to
what
my
distinguished
colleague
noted
earlier,
this
matter
was
dealt
with
at
length
during
the
course
of
the
1959
amendments
to
the
act,
the
landrum-griffin
amendments.
prior
to
that
time,
the
labor
board
had
repeatedly
held
that
spur
line
picketing
of
precisely
the
type
that
is
involved
here,
and
i'm
referring
to
the
international
rice
milling
case
decided
in
1949,
and
referring
also
to
the
great
northern
case
decided
in
1960
but
which
had
it
inception
before
the
amendments.
in
these
cases
with
identical
spur
line
picketing
involved,
the
labor
board
had
held
that
because
of
the
employer
definition
then
existing
in
the
act,
the
railroad
employees
were
not
subject
to
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
congress
dealt
with
this
problem
and
dealt
with
it
on
a
basis
of
rather
startling
unanimity.
senator
morse,
senator
dirksen,
the
then
senator
kennedy,
congressman
griffin,
all
addressed
themselves
to
this
question
of
the
closing
of
loopholes
because
of
findings
of
the
board
that
railroad
employees
were
not
employees
within
the
meaning
of
this
act.
they
were
not
prisons
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
and
the
unanimous
statements
documented
at
that
time
were
to
the
effect
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
close
this
loophole.
i
think
it
is
put
in
most
graphic
terms
by
senator
goldwater
who
also
joined
in
the
colloquy
and
i
am
referring
to
page
13
of
the
amicus
brief.
and
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
read
one
paragraph
which
i
think
puts
the
congressional
intent
in
sharp
focus.
this
is
quoting
senator
goldwater,
"suppose
you
get
a
situation
like
this,
the
union
has
a
dispute
with
employer
a.
a,
in
order
to
finish
his
economic
processes
to
make
his
profit
has
got
to
ship
his
goods
by
a
railroad
to
its
ultimate
destination.
so
the
union
throws
a
picket
line
around
the
railroad
spur
at
which
employer
a's
products
would
normally
be
loaded
into
the
freight
car."
the
purpose
of
that
picket
line
is
to
induce
the
railway
employees
to
refuse
to
load
that
stuff
for
handling.
the
board
has
said
that
under
the
present
language,
that
is
not
a
violation
because
railroad
employees
and
railroad
employers
are
not
employees
or
employees
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
under
this
new
bill
instead
of
using
the
term
"to
cease
doing
business
with
another
employer"
it
says,
"to
cease
doing
business
with
other
person,
person
includes
everybody
that
closes
that
loophole."
in
1960
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
he
was
not
a
chairman
of
the
committee.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
he
was
on
the
conference
committee
which
finally
hammered
out
the
final
provisions
of
landrum-griffin.
he
was
one
of
the
senate
conferees,
your
honor.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
also
that
in
1960,
the
distinguished
general
counsel
for
the
international
union
department
of
the
afl-cio,
writing
in
a
law
review
of
a
distinguished
midwestern
law
school
had
this
to
say,
this
is
the
now
mr.
justice
arthur
goldberg,
i
refer
to
this
in
page
16
of
our
brief.
advocates
of
tightening
the
secondary
boycott
restriction
however
argued
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
courts
had
so
interpreted
section
8(b)(4)
as
to
leave
a
number
of
gap
in
loopholes
through
which
genuinely
neutral
employers
and
their
employees
continued
to
be
victimized
by
the
use
of
the
secondary
boycott.
the
new
law
closes
these
so-called
loopholes
in
the
following
manner.
formally,
section
8(b)(4)
did
not
apply
to
inducement
of
the
employees
or
the
employers
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
citing
international
rice
milling.
the
new
act
prohibits
inducement
of
employees
of
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
including
railroad
employees.
now,
as
i
noted
earlier,
the
board
decision
in
international
rice
milling
referred
to
by
now
justice
goldberg,
continents
the
same
type
of
adjacent
spur
picketing
as
it's
involved
in
this
case
on
the
facts
identical
in
the
adjacent
spur.
rice
milling
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
on
remand,
the
board
without
further
comment
enforced
the
secondary
boycott
prescriptions.
the
fifth
circuit
differing
with
the
board
on
the
question
of
construction
of
who
was
covered
by
the
act
or
not
but
as
to
the
business
of
whether
or
not
a
secondary
boycott
was
involved,
there
was
no
word
of
dissent
raised
by
the
board.
similarly
in
1960,
an
identical
situation
occurred
on
the
great
northern
railway
case
where
the
board
found
adjacent
spur
picketing
not
covered
by
the
earlier
act
because
of
the
definition
of
employer.
this
went
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
and
here
again
without
a
word
of
dissent,
the
board
enforced
the
prescriptions
and
held
that
this
type
of
picketing
was
indeed
covered
by
the
prohibitions
of
8(b)(4).
so
we
say
that
what
the
congress
dealt
with
here
in
amending
the
act
in
1959
was
the
identical
problem
that
we're
talking
about
here
convincing
the
board
that
railroad
employees
were
subject
to
the
act
indeed
and
paying
not
further
attention
to
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
secondary
boycott
because
everyone
assumed
it
was.
now,
if
indeed
it
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
close
a
gapping
loophole,
what
is
sought
here
is
to
enlarge
that
old
loophole
very
substantially
indeed.
this
additional
comment
about
the
general
electric
case
as
i
have
noted
earlier,
it
clearly
is
a
common-situs
situation.
it
is
general
electric's
property.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
simply
placed
additional
restrictions
on
primary
situs
picketing,
added
rules
as
to
what
must
be
done
if
a
reserved
gate
occurs.
in
general
electric,
this
court
dealt
with
crystal
market
palace,
crystal
palace
market
with
more
dry
dock
and
by
inference
at
least
the
proof
of
these
and
in
each.
the
basic
principle
is
stated
that
it
is
an
obligation
of
a
union
engaged
in
a
primary
labor
dispute
to
minimize
the
impact
of
its
picketing
on
secondary
employers.
and
certainly
here,
if
the
steelworkers
union
was
entitled
to
picket
west
of
thompson
road
removed
from
the
carrier
property,
then
why
could
it
not
picket
on
the
westerly
city
limits
of
syracuse
or
on
the
westerly
limits
of
grand
central
station
in
new
york
city.
indeed,
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
for
the
first
time,
for
the
very
first
time,
as
it
was
enunciated
here
by
mr.
manoli
with
the
court
apply
an
oedometer
test
to
whether
or
no
the
picketing
was
primary
or
secondary.
the
test
under
the
statute
is
the
purpose
and
the
purpose
here
was
clear,
to
induce
new
york
central
employees
and
to
coerce
the
new
york
central
railroad
not
to
handle
carrier's
goods
and
this
your
honors
is
prescribed
by
the
statute.
