right
and
within
the
--
within
the
area
enclosed
by
the
gate?
justice
potter
stewart
just
run
through
another
gate?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
--
the
gate
itself
which
is
visible
on
the
foreground
of
a
--
exhibit
number
two
at
page
305,
does
that
gate
belong
to
the
new
york
central?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
own
the
real
estate
over
which
that
gate
is?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
and
they
have
the
keys,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
fact
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
attempted
physical
obstruction
of
the
move.
justice
potter
stewart
by
how
many
people?
justice
potter
stewart
a
number
of
--
several?
many?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
all
--
a
--
an
automobile
was
involved,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
was
the
ground
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
which
employees?
who?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
8th?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
not
a
part
of
this
case
now?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
not
a
common-situs
case,
is
it
really?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
reading
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
--
how
many
gates
were
there
in
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
all
well
picketed
and
this
gate,
as
you've
--
as
i
understand
it,
there's
a
--
was
--
was
for
the
sole
use
of
the
new
york
central
railroad,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
general
electric
clarified
the
whole
area?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
every
secondary
employer
who
would
ever
be
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
i
should
think,
would
be
related
in
someway
to
the
primary
employer
unless
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
point.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
he
being
his
supplier
or
his
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course,
there
would
have
been
no
point
--
nowhere
all
of
the
union
doing
so
either.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you're
not
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
object
would
have
been
the
same
if
you
picketed
the
new
york
central's
office
too.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
object
would
have
been
to
stop
this
train
from
making
deliveries
to
carrier
company.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
that?
you
said
all
you
going
to
say
about
the
fact
that
this
occurred
on
new
york
central
property.
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
--
had
a
gate
which
was
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
new
york
central
and
not
for
the
use
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
and
along
with
the
new
york
central
as
you
told
us
in
the
beginning.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
belongs
to
it,
it
was
in
front
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
little
bit
more
than
--
but
they're
not
of
any
importance
of
--
a
little
bit
more
than
merely
publicizing
if
you
look
at
the
pictures
on
--
pages
308,
309
and
310.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
probably
is
irrelevant.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
gate
there
in
ge
in
question,
what
was
it
--
who
was
it
used
by?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--gate
used
at
all
or
i
just
--
i
just
forgotten
the
facts.
was
that
gate
used
to
--
used
at
all
by
employees
of
the
primary
contractor
--
primary
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
all,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
delivery
people
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
--
but
not
to
people
say
who
were
doing
new
construction
in
there,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
distinction
in
that
case
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
very
realistic
distinction
and
is
the
gate
was
used
interchangeably
by
both
kinds
of
employee,
how
about
the
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
well,
let's
say
it
was
used
by
delivery
people
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
also
by
building
trades
people
who
were
building
their
construction
in
there.
was
that
the
fact
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
the
gate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
the
gate
apparently?
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
--
that
--
that
just
by
calling
up
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
make
the
argue
--
it
doesn't
make
the
fact
go
away
and
the
matter
of
who
owns
property
is
of
importance
and
most
areas
of
the
law
including
the
criminal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
got
my
own
property
and
i'm
not
guilty
about
anything
--
but
if
i
pickup
somebody
else's
then
i'm
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
the
purpose
is
identical.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it?
the
purpose
and
the
only
purpose
is
to
stop
the
new
york
central
from
making
deliveries
to
this
struck
plant,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
--
if
i
may
call
attention
--
if
i
may
call
attention
that
i
have
the
advance
sheet
and
it
may
have
be
--
i
don't
have
the
--
the
spot
citation,
but
in
that
case,
the
argument
was
made
and
i
--
let
me
read
from
the
opinion.
the
union
claims
that
if
the
board's
ruling
is
upheld,
employers
will
be
free
to
erect
separate
gates
for
deliveries,
customers,
and
replace
from
the
workers
which
will
be
immunized
from
picketing,
theory
is
baseless.
thank
you.
