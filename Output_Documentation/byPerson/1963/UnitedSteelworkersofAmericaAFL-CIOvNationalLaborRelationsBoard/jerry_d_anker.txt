mr.
jerry
d.
anker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
two
which
have
just
been
argued
also
arises
under
section
8(b)(4)(b)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
as
amended.
the
questions
presented
in
this
case,
however,
are
quite
different
from
those
that
are
involved
in
the
cases
which
you
have
just
heard.
we're
not
concerned
here
with
consumer
picketing
nor
with
appeals
to
high
level
supervisory
employees.
nor
are
we
particularly
concerned
with
the
1959
amendments
to
the
act.
the
conduct
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
more
traditional
union
conduct
of
appealing
to
employees
to
withhold
services,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
appeal
in
this
case
is
prohibited
by
8(b)(4)(b)
or
is
not.
specifically,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
this,
may
a
union
which
is
on
strike
at
an
industrial
plant,
picket
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
that
plant
which
is
used
by
a
railroad
to
provide
pickup
and
delivery
services
at
that
plant
for
the
purpose
of
the
preventing
the
railroad
from
performing
those
services.
i
will
say
that
there
is
one
fact
in
this
case
which
it
had
in
common
with
all
the
others
although
it's
often
said
that
section
8(b)(4)
was
intended
to
protect
neutral
employers,
not
the
employer
which
whom
the
union
is
engaged
in
a
lawful
dispute.
but
i
think
it's
significant
though,
obviously
not
controlling
that
in
each
of
the
three
cases
that
--
before
the
court
today,
the
employer
who's
complaining
that's
he's
being
--
that
the
complaining
of
a
violation
is
the
primary
employer
and
yet
in
each
case,
the
primary
employer
saying,
"we
are
complaining
because
you
were
hurrying,
that
isn't
neutral."
the
strike
in
this
case
was
against
carrier
corporation
which
is
one
of
the
respondents
here.at
the
large
plant
that
company
has
in
syracuse,
new
york.
in
connection
with
that
strike,
the
union
picketed
all
the
various
inferences
engaged
to
the
plant
but
the
dispute
concerns
only
to
picketing
which
took
place
at
one
particular
gate.
a
photograph
of
that
gate
appears
on
page
305
of
the
record.
its
general
counsel's
exhibit
number
two
and
i
believe
it's
easier
to
visualize
the
--
what
exactly
is
involved
in
that
case
if
we
look
at
that
photograph.
the
chain-linked
fence
which
you
see
in
that
picture
is
the
fence
which
surrounds
the
main
carrier
property.
at
one
time,
carrier
owned
all
of
the
real
estate
which
is
with
--
within
that
fence.you
can
see
the
carrier
plant
off
the
left
just
behind
that
clump
of
trees.
some
years
before
this
particular
case
arose,
carrier
conveyed
to
the
new
york
central
railroad,
a
35-foot
strip
along
the
southern
part
of
that
property,
just
inside
this
fence
on
which
these
railroad
tracks
run,
you'll
see
the
railroad
tracks
there
on
the
photograph.
now,
those
particular
tracks
are
used
for
two
purposes.
as
you
see,
just
inside
the
gate
they
divide
into
two-fourths.
the
right
hand
railroad
track
is
used
to
provide
pickup
and
delivery
service
not
to
carrier
but
to
other
--
two
or
three
other
industrial
plants
which
are
in
the
immediate
vicinity
adjoining
carrier.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
not
within
the
fence,
your
honor,
further
down.
you
can
see
it
in
this
picture.
there
are
other
gates,
other
little
spur
tracks
off
of
that
right
hand
track
and
other
gates
through
which
those
tracks
run.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
suppose
the
gate
does,
that's
right
because
they
own
the
piece
of
real
estate
on
which
gate
is.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
think
that's
right
although
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
this
makes
any
difference.
i
think
there
are
some
guards
employed
by
carrier
that
also
have
keys.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i'll
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
the
keys
are
in
control
of
the
railroad.
the
left
hand
track,
as
i
said,
serves
carrier
and
further
down
again
out
of
view
in
this
picture,
there
are
little
spurs
off
of
that
left
hand
track
which
run
right
into
carrier
plant
onto
carrier
property,
into
carrier
warehouses
where
cars
are
loaded
and
unloaded.
now,
for
the
first
nine
--
ten
days
of
this
particular
strike,
although
there
was
picketing
at
this
gate
throughout
i
believe,
the
railroad
made
no
effort
to
provide
service
to
carrier
but
used
this
gate
in
this
right
hand
track
to
provide
services
to
its
other
customers
and
the
union
pickets
interfered
in
no
way
with
those
operations.
those
operations
went
on
without
any
difficulty
of
any
kind.
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
strike
which
was
march
11,
1960,
by
prearrangement
between
carrier
and
new
york
central,
the
railroad
attempted
to
provide
service
to
carrier.
specifically,
it
wanted
to
move
14
railroad
cars
--
empty
railroad
cars
into
a
carrier
warehouse
and
pickup
from
that
same
spot
an
equal
number
or
approximately
equal
number
of
cars
which
had
been
loaded.
on
that
day,
it
first
provided
service
to
its
other
customers
and
so
long
as
it
was
doing
that,
the
union
pickets
did
not
interfere.
then,
it
withdrew
from
the
gate
that
the
certain
distance
where
it
had
left
the
14
railroad
cars
which
were
destined
for
carrier.
it
picked
up
those
cars
and
by
the
way,
also
at
that
point,
picked
up
another
crew.
the
regular
railroad
employees
were
unwilling
to
provide
service
to
a
struck
plant.
they
were
therefore
relieved
by
the
new
york
central
of
their
assignment
for
that
period
and
the
train
was
then
manned
by
lower
level
of
supervisory
people,
and
with
that
new
crew
proceeded
back
toward
this
gate
with
the
purpose
of
bringing
those
cars
into
the
struck
plant.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
conduct
took
place
which
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
pickets
both
by
peaceful
persuasion,
and
also,
there's
no
dispute
about
this
by
trying
to
obstruct
--
physically
obstruct
the
passage
of
this
train
by
standing
on
the
tracks,
try
to
prevent
this
particular
service
being
performed
for
the
company
with
whom
they
were
on
strike.
now,
in
the
process
of
moving
those
cars
in
and
taking
the
loaded
cars
out,
it
caused
this
fork
that's
right
here
and
near
of
the
gate.
the
railroad
had
to
pass
several
times
back
and
forth
to
accomplish
those
switching
operations
at
that
fork
and
each
time
that
the
train
came
out
of
the
gate
or
tried
to
go
back
in,
it
was
met
with
the
similar
kind
of
conduct
by
the
union
pickets.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
don't
know,
quite
a
--
quite
a
number
of
people.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
several
--
yeah,
many
people.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes,
at
one
point
there
was
a
--
an
automobile
which
was
found
to
be
owned
by
union
representative
parked
on
those
track.
i
don't
think
there
were
any
feisty
cops
but
there
was
this
kind
of
obstruction
--
attempt
to
obstruct
the
track.
on
those
facts,
the
nlrb
found
that
while
the
physically
coercive
and
the
violent
conduct
which
took
place
not
here
but
at
other
places
in
connection
with
the
strike,
the
union
did
violate
section
8(b)(1)
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
coerce
or
restrain
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
statutory
rights.
that
finding
is
not
involved
to
these
dates,
there
was
a
--
it
was
not
challenged
by
the
union
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it's
no
longer
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
8(b)(1)(a)
--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
restraint
and
coercion
of
the
employees.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
the
theory
--
well
--
there
was
a
general
pattern
of
conduct
since
this
was
a
plant
which
was
trying
to
operate
during
a
strike.
there
was
general
pattern
of
coercive
conduct
in
various
inferences
and
that
what
the
board
said
was
that
this
conduct
at
this
gate
was
part
of
that
pattern
and
that
even
though
the
railroad
employees
are
not
employees
under
the
act,
the
union
by
behaving
in
this
manner
toward
those
people,
indicated
that
anybody
who
could
see
that
if
they
try
to
get
into
that
plant,
they
would
--
they
would
have
a
problem
doing
so
and
that
was
the
essence
of
the
violation.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
8(b)(1)
which
is
not
a
part
of
this
case
now.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
dropped
out
of
this
case
now.
on
the
question
which
is
here,
question
not
of
whether
this
was
coercion
but
whether
it
was
a
secondary
boycott
under
section
8(b)(4)(b),
the
board
found
that
it
was
not
and
it
relies
through
that
decision
entirely
on
this
court's
very
recent
decision
in
the
general
electric
case,
where
similarly
employees
of
other
employers
were
in
--
induced
by
a
striking
union
not
to
enter
any
plant
which
was
on
strike.
and
this
court
said
that
so
long
as
those
employees
were
performing
work
which
is
related
to
the
operations
of
the
struck
plant,
any
such
inducement
is
not
a
secondary
boycott
activity.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
decision
and
that's
what
brings
us
here.
the
major
premise
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
section
8(b)(4)(b)
prohibits
any
efforts
by
union
to
seek
the
support
of
any
employee
who
was
not
an
employee
of
the
primary
employer.
if
the
--
the
union
may
not
have
make
any
kind
of
request
for
support
to
employees
who
work
for
other
employers
unless
that
appeal
is
simply
an
incident
to
a
lawful
attempt
to
appeal
for
the
support
of
the
primary
employees
which
obviously
in
this
case,
it
was
not
--
there
were
no
primary
employees
immediately
at
the
vicinity
of
this
conduct.
we
don't
contend
that
there
was
any
object
here
to
appeal
the
primary
employees.
the
union
was
trying
to
prevent
the
strength
from
going
in.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
i
would
say
not
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
anything
turns
on
that
as
we
read
the
cases.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
would
say
it's
not
a
common-situs
case.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
there
were
many
gates.
there's
a
map
on
page
311
which
shows
them.
there
was
one
personnel
entrance
and
a
couple
truck
entrances,
i
think.
there
are
a
couple
of
personnel
entrances,
three
or
four
gates
at
least
and
they
were
all
well
picketed.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's
correct.
there
were
also
some
gates
i
would
--
that
were
--
i
think
for
the
sole
use
of
trucks.
other
company's
trucks
but
they're
not
involved
in
this
charge
either.
the
basic
question
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn
between
what
the
statute
now
expressly
refers
to
as
primary
strike
and
primary
picketing
and
what
the
act,
though
it
doesn't
use
the
words
"intends
to
prohibit"
as
a
secondary
boycott.
question
is
not
very
different
from
the
question
that
arose
in
ge
or
the
many,
many
other
cases
before
the
1959
amendments.
the
language
of
the
statute
has
been
changed
but
i
don't
think
anybody
argues
that
the
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
has
been
changed
insofar
as
it
applies
to
this
kind
of
a
question.
before
general
electric,
before
1961,
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
confusion
on
where
that
line
was
to
be
drawn.
there
were
many,
many
cases
but
it
seemed
that
the
more
cases
there
were,
the
more
foggy
the
line
became.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's
right.
we
think
it
did
you
honor.
general
electric
involved
a
--
a
confrontation
of
two
conflicting
lines
of
--
of
development
which
we've
traced
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
history
but
i
will
just
state
what
they
were.
one
principle
which
you
see
running
through
many,
many
cases
since
1947,
was
that
so
long
as
the
union,
when
it
is
appealing
to
secondary
employees,
is
asking
no
more
than
that
they
stop
working
at
the
side
of
a
primary
dispute
at
the
plant
or
shop
or
store
where
the
strike
was
in
progress
then
even
though
possibly
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
might
reach
even
that
kind
of
conduct
that
is
the
normal
type
of
thing
which
occurs
in
a
primary
strike.
that
was
one
line
of
development.
the
second
line
which
began
we
think
we
can
trace
it
to
about
1953,
was
quite
different
and
in
direct
conflict
with
that.
so
the
conflict
was
never
really
acknowledged.
that
second
line
was,
that
any
appeal
and
it's
essentially
what
the
court
below
in
this
case
relied
on,
any
appeal
to
employees
or
secondary
employers
is
unlawful
unless
it
is
merely
an
incidental
or
accidental
or
unavoidable
part
of
what
is
otherwise
justifiable
as
an
appeal
to
primary
employees.
those
two
lines
sort
of
existed
parallel
and
the
--
the
conflict
was
there
though
it
was
never
really
acknowledged.ge
presented
the
inevitable
direct
confrontation
of
those
two
lines
because
the
picketing
was
at
a
gate
to
the
primary
premises,
there
was
no
question
about
that,
but
the
gate
was
used
only
by
secondary
employees.
so
if
it
was
unlawful
to
appeal
the
secondary
employees
except
part
of
law
--
except
where
it's
part
of
a
lawful
appeal
to
primary
employees,
then
the
picketing
in
ge
would
be
unlawful.
and
indeed
that's
what
the
board
held
in
that
case.
if
on
the
other
hand
if
the
earlier
cases
are
correct
that
it's
permissible
to
ask
secondary
employees
not
to
work
at
a
--
at
a
site
of
the
strike
then
the
ge
case
is
easily
answered
in
exactly
the
opposite
way
because
this
was
the
site
of
the
strike.
this
court,
i
think
accepted
neither
one
of
those
two
theories
in
full.
it
developed
instead
a
third
which
is
in
the
court's
words
that
the
key
to
the
problem
is
the
kind
of
work
which
is
performed
by
these
secondary
employees.
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
borrowing
some
language
from
judge
lumbard
in
the
second
circuit
in
an
earlier
case,
that
if
the
work
is
--
that
these
secondary
employees
are
to
perform,
is
work
which
is
related
to
the
normal
operations
of
the
struck
employer
then
it
has
a
permissible
part
of
a
primary
strike
for
union
to
ask
those
employees
not
to
perform
that
work.
if
it
is
unrelated,
on
the
other
hand,
then
even
though
the
work
might
be
at
the
struck
site
itself,
the
union
cannot
go
out
of
its
way
but
picketing
a
separate
gate
used
by
employees
who
perform
work
unrelated
to
normal
operations.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
the
work
would
be
related?
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
is
meant
by
work
which
is
related
in
normal
operations
and
the
court
didn't
have
to
define
it
in
ge
because
it
was
remanded
to
the
board
for
that
purpose.
it
doesn't
have
to
define
it
here
really
because
there's
no
dispute
that
at
least
that
delivery
and
pickup
work
is
so
related.
but,
the
definition
that
i
think
is
what
the
court
had
in
mind
is
that
work
which
without
which
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
the
employer
to
conduct
his
operations
or
impossible
for
him
to
conduct
his
operations.
now,
that's
not
true
for
example
of
construction
worker.
if
the
employer
was
in
the
--
was
building
a
--
a
new
addition
to
his
plant,
the
non-performance
of
that
particular
work
would
not
prevent
him
from
carrying
on
his
own
ordinary
operations
that's
unrelated
to
ordinary
operations.
now,
the
railroad
in
this
case
certainly
the
--
the
performance
of
deliveries
to
these
neighboring
employers
is
work
unrelated
to
the
operations
of
carrier.
if
the
union
had
made
any
effort
to
interfere
with
that
work,
i
would
have
to
concede
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
sure
there
would
have
been.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
the
point
would
be
exactly
the
point
which
the
statute
was
intended
to
prevent,
to
force
the
railroad
to
stop
making
deliveries
to
carrier.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
now,
it
happened
then
we
tried
--
the
union
tried
not
to
force
the
railroad
to
stop
making
deliveries
in
the
sense
of
the
president
of
new
york
central
but
simply
to
stop
the
very
people
on
the
spot
from
performing
that
work.
and
i
would
say
they
were
unsuccessful
even
though
they
went
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
law
in
that
effort.
if
the
union
had
really
gone
around
to
everywhere
that
railroad
operates
disrupting
its
operations
and
saying
we're
going
to
continue
doing
this
until
you
stop
providing
service
to
carrier,
they
might
have
been
successful.
at
that
point,
the
president
of
new
york
central
said,
"well
our
service
to
carrier
is
just
not
that
important."
we've
got
to
run
a
railroad.
and
that
would
have
been
what
a
--
what
--
what
the
act
was
intended
to
prevent.
it's
like
--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--
a
general
disruption
of
the
railroads'
operations,
but
that's
not
what
was
involved
here.
here,
we
were
simply
asking
people,
not
a
railroad.
we're
not
trying
to
put
pressure
on
the
railroad.
we're
asking
people
or
trying
to
prevent
people
from
doing
work,
which
work
was
directly
involved
in
the
operations
of
the
employer
where
we
had
a
strike
going
on.
the
object
really
of
picketing
this
gate
was
no
different
than
the
object
of
picketing
to
keep
out
carrier's
employees.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
because
of
the
primary
picketing
proviso
which
congress
put
in
to
make
clear
that
primary
picketing
is
exempt
--
i
would
say
the
object
is
different
because
the
objects
here
is
not
to
put
pressure
on
the
railroad
but
to
put
pressure
on
carrier
by
provide
--
by
depriving
it
of
service.
but
that
the
--
that
argument
is
no
longer
really
a
part
of
this
case.
now,
there
are
three
distinctions
which
are
suggested
by
respondent.
the
three
bases
for
distinguishing
the
general
electric
case
and
--
and
holding
that
the
rule
in
the
general
electric
case
is
not
applicable
here.
i
want
to
deal
with
those
only
in
the
very
briefest
way.
one,
is
the
distinction
relied
upon
by
the
court
below,
that
because
this
little
35-foot
strip
was
owned
in
fee
simple
by
the
railroad,
that
somehow
makes
the
difference.
in
our
view,
it
--
it
can't
make
a
difference
really
on
any
theory
either
on
the
general
electric
theory
or
indeed
on
any
of
the
other
two
theories
which
preceded
the
general
electric
resolution
because
what
the
statute
deals
with
is
not
where
you
picket
as
such,
but
what
you're
trying
to
accomplish
by
picketing.
now,
sometimes,
where
you
picket,
tends
to
show
just
as
the
case
we
were
just
talking
about.
if
the
union
picketed
the
new
york
central
depot,
somewhere
20
miles
away,
obviously
the
purpose
of
that
would
be
to
cause
or
disruption
of
operations
there.
and
in
that
sense,
the
location
of
the
picketing,
of
course
is
relevant.
but
it's
relevant
not
in
itself
but
only
to
the
extent
that
it
reveals
what
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
is.
secondly,
there
is
an
argument
made
in
this
case
that
when
congress
amended
the
act
to
include
railroad
employees,
it
intended
to
reach
this
kind
of
conduct.
there's
just
no
evidence
to
that,
really.
all
the
congress
intended
to
do
as
the
solicitor
general
explained
in
the
earlier
argument,
was
to
close
a
loophole
which
exempted
any
kind
of
disruption
of
railroad
operations
entirely.
but
there
was
no
intention
to
give
railroads
a
special
status
different
from
trucks
or
from
any
--
anybody
else
that
provide
service
to
a
said
plant.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
think
i
have
--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
think
the
fact
that
it
was
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
new
york
central
makes
no
more
difference
in
this
case.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
the
fact
that
it's
a
very
exclusive
use
of
the
new
york
central
makes
no
difference
--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--
the
fact
that
it
belongs
to
it
makes
no
difference
either.
not
because
that
question
was
involved
in
general
electric
but
because
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
where
you
picket
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute.
there
are
many
case
and
now
just
for
a
moment,
if
you
look
at
the
common-situs
cases
at
which
you
referred
to
before
justice
stewart,
all
of
those
are
cases
where
the
union
is
picketing
somebody
else's
premises.
at
gates
owned
by
other
people
but
they
are
all
cases
in
which
the
--
the
picketing
is
held
or
to
be
primary,
if
it
follows
the
rules
because
it
is
intended
to
accomplish
no
more
than
picketing
is
suppose
to
accomplish
and
that's
exactly
this
case.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
would
just
like
to
comment
on
two
points
which
you
have
been
made
by
mr.
kammholz.
one
and
the
first
really
was
the
question
has
been
dealt
with
both
by
the
court
and
by
mr.
kammholz,
the
question
of
the
relevance
of
where
the
picketing
takes
place.
the
other
point
i
want
to
deal
with
is
the
question
of
loophole
closing
with
respect
to
railroads.
turning
to
the
first
point
first,
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
is
not
at
least,
portion
of
it
that
applies
to
this
case,
does
not
regulate
picketing
as
such.
it
prohibits
inducing
employees
to
take
certain
conduct
for
certain
purposes.
now,
i
think
you
can
clarify
this
question
of
what
the
relevance
of
the
location
of
the
picketing
is
if
we
look
at
another
form
of
inducement.
picketing,
it's
clear
for
purposes
of
what
we're
talking
about
now,
is
just
one
of
several
kind
of
inducement,
another
kind
is
letter
writing,
another
kind
is
speech
making.
now,
suppose
the
union
had
made
a
speech
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
at
their
union
hall
at
the
westerly
boundary
of
syracuse
if
you
like
and
had
said
"please
do
not,
please
do
not
make
deliveries
and
pickups
at
the
carrier
plant."
that
conduct
is
lawful
or
not
for
the
same
reason
that
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
lawful
or
not,
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
the
speech
was
made.
question
is,
"are
you
asking
for
the
employees
to
do
something
which
the
act
is
intended
to
prevent
you
from
asking
them
to
do?"
now,
the
location
of
picketing
has
one
point,
has
one
aspect
which
is
not
present
when
you're
talking
about
a
public
address,
of
course,
and
that
is
that
mr.
justice
black
has
made
this
point
that
the
picket
is
requesting
usually
at
a
particular
place
where
the
picketing
takes
place.
therefore,
many,
many
cases
which
you
will
read
will
rely
as
a
point
of
evidence
on
where
the
picketing
took
place.
if
we
did
picket
the
depot,
the
normal
inference
would
be
we
were
asking
for
strike
action,
refusals
to
work
at
the
depot,
and
that
would
be
illegal,
that's
why
the
location
of
the
picketing
is
relevant
not
in
itself
but
as
evidence
of
what
the
union
was
asking
people
to
do.
in
this
case,
it's
perfectly
clear
and
conceded
by
mr.
kammholz,
what
we
were
trying
to
get
people
to
do.
we
were
trying
to
get
railroad
people
to
stop
servicing
carrier.
now,
that
may
be
lawful,
we
believe
it
is,
the
board
believes
it
is.
that
may
be
unlawful,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
we
make
that
request
or
engage
in
that
inducement.
that
whole
issue
of
title
of
the
property
and
location
of
the
picketing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
or
the
issue
in
this
case
and
that's
why
mr.
manoli
says
that's
a
fortuity.
it
just
makes
no
difference.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
would
make
out
--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
i
--
that's
true
but
not
under
this
statute.
i
make
this
point
in
a
general
way
that
under
this
statute
and
under
the
--
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
general
electric,
when
the
union
is
appealing
or
inducing
to
--
appealing
to
or
inducing
employees
of
other
employees,
there
is
one
test
and
that
test
is,
is
the
union
simply
asking
those
people
to
refrain
from
work
related
to
the
primary
employers'
operations
or
is
it
asking
them
to
do
something
else,
engage
in
some
other
kind
of
stoppage
which
is
injurious
to
their
employer
and
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
directly
with
the
operations
of
the
employer
that's
on
strike,
that's
the
test.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
location
of
picketing
is
relevant,
in
applying
that
test
is
relevant.
but
in
this
case,
the
location
of
the
picketing
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all.
now,
turning
to
the
other
point
very
briefly
on
the
--
what
the
act
--
the
1959
amendments
intended
to
do
when
they
closed
loopholes,
i
want
to
correct
mr.
kammholz
on
a
couple
of
factual
statements.
first
of
all,
a
quotation
by
mr.
goldwater,
it's
not
mr.
goldwater.
it
is
something
which
mr.
goldwater
inserted
in
the
record
after
the
act
was
passed.
the
words
are
not
his,
the
words
or
the
words
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
staff
of
the
senate
labor
committee
specifically
the
republican
minority
council.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
goldwater,
yes,
yes.
on
the
rights
--
on
the
--
the
rice
milling
decision
for
whatever
relevance
it
has,
the
facts
of
that
case
were
not
the
same
as
this
because
insofar
as
railroad
picketing
was
concerned,
the
union
was
--
the
union
picketing
interfered
with
deliveries
not
only
to
the
struck
employers
but
also
other
employers
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
dispute.
the
union
picketed
a
point
of
the
railroad
which
just
stops
railroad
operations.
and
the
reference
on
that
is
84
n.l.r.b.
369
where
that
fact
stated
very
clearly.
as
to
the
great
northern
case
which
was
a
later
case,
i
agree,
that
case
is
on
all
force
with
this
one
on
its
facts.
and
it
--
it
come
from
the
period
when
the
board
define
a
secondary
boycott
as
any
request
to
employees
of
other
employers.
they
applied
that
rule
not
only
in
that
case
but
in
the
general
electric
case,
in
a
case
which
involved
truck
drivers
indeed
called
mcjunkin
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
that
was
the
rule
at
that
time,
at
least
the
dominant
view
of
most
of
the
board
cases.
it
has
oppositely
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
under
general
electric
case
and
therefore
has
no
bearing.
thank
you.
