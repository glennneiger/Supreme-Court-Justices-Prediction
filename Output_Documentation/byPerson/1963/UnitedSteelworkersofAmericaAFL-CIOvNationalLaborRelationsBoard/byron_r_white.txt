but
picketing
--
the
picketing
that
was
done
back
where
they
made
up
the
train
on
the
railroad
property
in
those
yards,
then
--
then
you
have
a
different
question,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
it
gets
way
--
if
a
train
gets
to
the
gate,
that
fortuity
circumstance
--
it
--
it
may
--
it
becomes
as
the
primary
technique.
justice
byron
r.
white
outside
the
provisions
of
the
secondary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
--
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
true.
but
there
is
an
added
factor
when
they
get
away
from
the
primary
--
from
--
from
the
primary
--
from
the
scene
of
the
primary
dispute
and
that
is
this,
that
when
they
are
picketing
at
the
trucker's
terminal
or
when
they
are
picketing
at
the
terminal
of
the
other
new
york
central
then
there
is
a
very
--
a
very
serious
risk
--
a
very
serious
risk
that
the
picketing
will
not
merely
stop
--
will
not
merely
stop
at
disrupting
the
services
that
new
york
central
is
performing
for
carrier.
but
then
it
will
involve
the
--
the
railroad's
operations
more
generally
and
particularly
its
relations
with
other
customers
of
the
railroad
company
who
has
seen
the
picket
line
there
may
--
may
respect
it.
that
is
the
critical
difference.
now
here,
those
factors
are
not
present
because
as
i
have
said
--
as
i
have
said
here,
the
picketing
here
was
at
the
scene
--
it
was
at
the
scene
of
the
carrier
--
of
the
struck
carrier
plant.
the
--
the
thrust
--
the
thrust
of
the
--
pressure
of
the
picket
line
was
against
carrier.
and
finally,
the
involvement
of
the
railroad
company
--
the
involvement
of
the
railroad
company
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
in
the
primary
dispute
is
no
greater.
it
is
no
greater
in
scope
or
effect
than
it
would've
been
the
case
of
the
truck
driver
is
precisely
the
same.
it's
precisely
the
same.
now,
we
submit
that
the
key
to
this
problem
is
not
really
to
be
found
in
what
i've
described
but
i've
modified
it
as
the
fortuitous
fact
that
the
title
of
right-of-way
is
in
--
is
in
carrier.
the
key
to
this
case
is
to
be
--
is
not
to
be
found
in
that
factor
but
the
key
in
this
case,
as
in
the
general
electric
case,
is
to
be
found
in
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
neutral
employees
are
performing
or
are
being
asked
to
refrain
from
performing
behind
the
picket
line.
where
that
work,
pickups
and
deliveries
in
this
case
is
incidental
to
the
operations
of
the
primary
employer,
then
it
seems
to
us
--
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
really
be
exalting
form
over
substance
to
say
--
to
say
that
this
case
is
different
than
the
case
of
the
truck
driver,
merely
because
in
the
case
of
the
truck
driver,
he
may
be
approaching
the
plant
via
public
highway
or
via
premises
owned
by
the
primary
employer.
but
that
in
this
case
here,
he'd
--
the
delivery
man
--
the
railroad
--
the
railroad
man
is
approaching
a
primary
employee
and
then
the
primary
plant
on
premises
that
are
owned
by
the
--
by
the
railroad
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
your
(inaudible)
certainly
lead
to
no
picketing
at
special
gates
of
the
primary
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
pretty
follow
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
under
the
findings
of
general
electric,
just
came
in
carrier-owned
property,
at
least
a
dictum
in
general
electric,
it's
clearly
company-owned.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
hold
for
you,
that
dictum
would
have
to
be
repudiated
if
this
were
on
carrier-owned
--
carrier-owned
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
here
you
got
a
--
so
your
whole
case
rest
on
the
ownership
of
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
many
companies
were
reserved
through
this
gate,
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
four,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
do
you
--
do
you
--
is
there
--
is
there
any
suggestion
on
the
facts
that
there
was
any
interference
with
the
railroads
that
--
withstanding
the
other
company
besides
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
might
as
well
have
been
a
gate
only
for
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
