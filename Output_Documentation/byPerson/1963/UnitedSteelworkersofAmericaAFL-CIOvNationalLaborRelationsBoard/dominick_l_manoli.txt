mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
stewart,
exactly
how
much
ge
clarified
this
entire
area.
now,
the
line
between
primary
and
the
secondary
and
perhaps
we
of
the
board
are
not
entirely
in
agreement
with
all
the
implications
that
the
petitioner
may
seek
to
read
into
that
case
but
we
are
in
agreement
on
this
one
issue,
that
ge
does
control
this
case.
and
the
issue
as
we
see
it
in
this
case
is
a
relatively
narrow
one
as
mr.
anker
has
indicated
here.
the
picketing
here
took
place
in
immediate
vicinity
of
the
struck
carrier
plant.
the
picketing
took
place
at
the
gate
which
led
--
which
led
to
the
--
to
the
carrier
premises
and
the
pickets
made
their
appeal
to
the
neutral
railroad
employees
as
they
approached
that
gate.
and
that
gate
was
the
nearest
place
--
was
the
nearest
place
to
the
carrier
plant
where
the
strikers
and
the
pickets
could
publicize
to
the
railroad
employees
their
dispute
with
carrier.
and
again,
the
railroad
employers
who
were
performing
services,
pickups
and
deliveries
which
were
incidental
than
normal
everyday
operations
of
carrier,
and
finally
--
finally
the
pickets
asked
them
to
discontinue
only
that
service
to
carrier.
that
--
many
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
they
were
seen
by
--
there
was
some
question
and
some
coercive
--
coercive
activity
that
went
on
that
it
--
it's
that
such
easily
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
but
either
--
we
think
that
that
for
purposes
of
8(b)(4)(a)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
it
makes
no
difference.
it
makes
no
difference.
in
fact,
this
court
so
held
in
the
international
rice
milling
case
back
in
1952
as
i
recall.
now,
the
issue
which
this
court
has
called
upon
to
decide
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
a
very
narrow
one,
is
whether
--
is
whether
picketing
at
the
scene
of
the
--
at
the
scene
of
the
industrial
dispute
having
delivered
appeal
that
it
had
in
this
case
and
having
what
i
may
mention
to
say
nearly
all
of
the
--
virtually
all
of
the
indicia
--
all
of
the
indicia
of
traditional
primary
activity
is
converted
into
secondary
and
unlawful
activity
merely
because
--
merely
because
the
title
to
the
railroad
right
away
happened
to
be
in
the
railroad
company
rather
than
in
carrier.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
used
on
--
it
was
not
used
by
carrier
employees
and
i
will
indicate
that
that
is
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
except
the
railroad,
i
will
indicate
that
that's
irrelevant
under
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
ge.
now,
ge
made
it
perfectly
plain
--
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
a
union
or
employees
who
are
picketing
at
the
scene
of
an
industrial
--
of
a
labor
dispute,
may
appeal
directly
to
neutral
employees
--
to
neutral
employees
to
honor
the
picket
line
and
to
refrain
from
performing
services
for
this
struck
employer
behind
the
picket
line
which
are
incidentally
the
normal
everyday
operations
of
that
particular
employer.
that
case
said
that
that
kind
of
--
though
--
that
kind
of
an
appeal,
that
kind
of
picketing
was
unquestionably
legal,
lawful,
traditional
primary
activity
and
beyond
the
sanctions
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
secondary
boycott
activity.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
court
said
that
that
this
is
a
--
this
has
been
a
traditional
form
of
picketing
that
employees
will
--
will
not
only
hope
when
they're
picketing
a
particular
plant
--
not
only
hope,
that
the
second
neutral
employees
will
not
perform
services
behind
the
picket
line,
but
that
also
that
they
may
go
ahead
and
ask
them
not
to
perform
those
services
behind
the
picket
line.
as
in
ge,
i
think
i
made
that
perfectly
clear.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
problem
in
there
arose
in
connection
with
a
separate
gate
that
had
been
setup
by
those
independent
contractors.
and
your
honor,
may
i
recall,
the
question
was
whether
the
union
could
picket
there
since
the
--
since
title
to
the
premises
was
in
the
primary
employer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
but
the
gate,
however,
was
reserved
exclusively,
was
reserved
exclusively
for
an
independent
contractor
who's
performing
some
kind
of
construction
work
on
there.
and
then
the
court
drew
the
line
between
work
which
was
incidental,
the
normal
everyday
operations,
and
work
which
was
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
that's
--
that's
the
point
that
i
--
that
i
sought
to
emphasize
is
that,
that
case
as
i
say
made
it
clear
that
the
union
could
appeal
to
the
neutral
servicemen
of
all
kinds
who
were
--
to
honor
the
picket
line
and
to
refrain
from
performing
services
behind
the
picket
line
for
the
primary
employer
which
have
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
don't
yet
--
and
particularly
for
example,
in
connection
with
delivery
people
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
a
union
could
appeal
to
track
employees
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
that
--
that's
--
the
distinction
of
the
case
is
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
it
was
not
used
interchangeably.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
separate
gate
setup
exclusively.
now,
if
it
were
used
by
both
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
delivery
people
for
the
primary?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
that
case
i
think
the
implication
is
that
the
union
could
picket
that
at
that
place,
but
the
union
could
picket
at
that
place.
and
contrary
--
contrary
if
the
employer
under
that
case,
the
--
if
an
employer
setup
a
separate
gate
--
a
separate
delivery
entrance,
if
i
may
use
that
instead
of
a
gate
or
either
one,
a
separate
delivery
entrance
which
was
only
for
neutral
truck
drivers
which
were
making
pickups
and
deliveries
for
the
primary
employer.
the
fact
that
that
gate
was
not
being
used
by
the
employees,
the
primary
employer,
this
court
said
would
make
that
kind
of
picketing
any
the
less
primary.
now,
as
we
see
this
case
--
as
we
see
this
case,
it's
in
essence
reduced
to
its
essentials
that
comes
down
to
this,
of
a
case
of
picketing
at
the
scene
of
a
--
of
a
labor
dispute
designed
to
induce
railroad
employees
instead
of
truck
drivers
--
railroad
employees
instead
of
truck
driver
to
refrain
from
making
deliveries
or
pickups
to
the
primary
employer.
now,
what
meaningful
distinction
can
we
draw
between
the
railroad
employees
and
the
truck
drivers
in
this
context?
if
this
be
the
appeals
--
if
this
kind
of
picketing
when
directed
to
neutral
truck
drivers
to
honor
the
picket
line
and
to
refrain
from
performing
services,
deliveries,
and
pickups
with
the
primary
employer,
if
that
kind
of
picketing
is
lawful
primary
at
picketing,
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
it's
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
sensible
basis
upon
which
we
can
draw
distinction
and
say
that
the
picketing
becomes
illegal
when
for
truck
drivers,
we
substitute
railroad
people.
now,
of
course
the
argument
is
--
the
argument
is
that
the
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
here,
the
railroad
employee
--
the
railroad
company
own
the
title
to
the
--
to
the
right-of-way
--
to
the
railroad
right-of-way
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
to
the
gate
--
and
to
the
gate
and
the
railroad
had
the
gate
too
--
had
the
key
to
the
gate
too.
the
--
that
that
--
that
that
makes
--
that
makes
the
difference
within
this
case
and
the
case
of
the
truck
drivers
coming
out
on
the
primary
employers'
premises
for
the
purpose
of
making
deliveries
or
pickups.
but
i
submit
your
honors
--
i
submit
your
honors
from
the
stand
--
from
the
standpoint
of
either
business
relations
or
from
the
stand
--
of
business
operations,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
labor
relations,
this
factor,
this
fortuity
--
this
fortuity
that
the
title
of
the
right-of-way
happen
to
belong
to
the
railroad
company,
affords
no
meaningful
--
no
meaningful
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
important
either
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
strike
the
word
fortuity
but
the
--
i
had
no
--
well,
except
there's
a
fact.
i
will
accept
there's
fact
that
this
right-of-way
belongs
to
the
railroad.
but
we
think
that
that
fact,
it
does
not
really
make
for
any
practical
or
significant
--
it
does
not
furnish
any
significant
or
meaningful
basis
for
distinguishing
this
case
from
what
i
call
the
truck
case
because
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases,
the
picketing
is
taking
place
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
--
the
struck
plant.
in
both
cases,
the
appeal
is
made
to
honor
the
picket
line
and
to
refrain
from
performing
services
which
are
incidentally
the
normal
operations
of
the
primary
employer.
and
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases,
if
the
picketing
is
successful,
the
result
is
the
same.
namely
in
the
case
of
the
truck
drivers,
they
will
refuse
to
make
pickups
or
deliveries,
and
the
same
follows
in
the
case
of
the
railroad
employees.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
now
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
correct.
i
was
about
to
say,
that
i
am
not
suggesting
the
geography
of
the
title
of
the
picketed
premises
was
always
irrelevant.
but
this
court,
however,
in
ge
said
that
if
the
title
of
the
premises
does
not
necessarily
mark
the
boundary
line
between
secondary
and
primary
--
and
primary
picketing.
in
that
case,
your
honors
will
recall
that
premises
were
owned
--
were
owned
by
the
primary
employer
but
not
--
if
the
work
that
was
been
--
being
done
by
the
independent
contractor
on
those
premises
met
the
test
that
this
court
laid
down,
then
the
union
could
have
pick
--
could
or
could
not
have
picketed,
without
regard
to
whether
it
was
owned
by
the
primary
employer
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
the
independent
contractor.
now,
of
course
--
of
course,
if
the
union
here
were
to
--
if
the
union
were
to
extend
this
picketing
away
from
the
primary
premises,
and
it
could
extend
this
picketing
to
the
terminal
--
to
the
terminal
of
the
neutral
trucker
--
trucker
or
in
the
case
of
the
railroad
employees
extended
its
picketing
to
the
--
to
the
warehouse
or
the
terminal
or
--
or
a
railroad
station,
or
what
have
you,
of
the
railroad
company,
then
i
think
in
that
situation
--
in
that
situation,
geography,
time
of
the
premises
might
give
you
a
meaningful
basis
--
a
meaningful
basis
for
drawing
a
line
between
permissible
pressure
upon
the
primary
employer
and
the
involvement
of
a
neutral
dispute
on
its
own.
and
the
reason
for
that
--
