mr.
fred
w.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
appointed
by
the
trial
court
to
defend
the,
defendant
jesse
jones,
jesse,
not
jesse
james
but
george
dixon
in
this
particular
case
and
we
rely
on
the
same
arguments
and
the
same
cases
as
previously
discussed
here
by
mr.
turner,
who
represents
jesse
james
arnold.
therefore
i'll
not
go
into
--
discuss
the
same
aspects
of
the
case
probably
i'll
try
to
skirt
around
what
he
had
to
say
and
at
the
same
time
add
my
feelings
or
my
thoughts
on
this
case.
it's
been
contended
by
the
state
that
we
should
have
gone
forward
and
don't
much
bother
than
we
did
in
our
attempt
to
show
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury.
in
this
particular
case
we
do
not
deal
with
the
petit
jury
at
all,
because
a
petit
jury
was
drawn
from
another
county.
they,
the
judge,
the
trail
judge
ended
an
order
seeking
and
requiring
the
clerk
of
duplin
county
to
furnish
us
with
200
special
venire
to
try
the
case
and
they
were
gone
from
duplin
county.
so
only
the
grand
jury
of
the
noah
county
is
the
jury
we
are
concerned
with.
now
we
showed
by
the
testimony
of
the
clerk
the
absence
for
a
large
number
of
years
of
all
except
for
one
person
of
negro
race.
now
the
state
court
contented
that
we
should
have
gone
forward
and
shown
why
and
we
felt
that
that
was
a
burden
of
the
state
and
that,
well
when
we
showed
we
stopped
and
our
motion
was
overruled.
the
state
went
on
said,
while
we
didn't
even
show
the
constitution
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
these
men.
well
only
one
negro
had,
had
been
served
on
the
grand
jury
in
24
years
previous
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
on
that
particular
grand
jury
or
not.
so
we
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
we
showed
the
constitution
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
these
men.
however,
i
know
for
fact
that
that
there
was
no
negro
in
that
grand
jury.
i
recall
when
the
negro
did
serve
on
the
grand
jury,
just
as
--
and
it
was
some
years
ago.
i
also
recall
when
the
one
served
that
was
found
to
be
a
resident
of
pitt
country
and
was
excused
on
the
first
day
that
that
particular
grand
juror
was
appointed
to
the
grand
jury,
he
got
up
and
said,
i'd
like
to
make
a
statement,
and
he
said,
i
moved
a
few
weeks
ago,
across
the
county
line
into
pitt
county.
well
he
was
off
the
grand
jury
and
that
was,
he
was
summarily
dismissed
just
like
that,
which
he
should
have
been.
therefore,
based
upon
these
arguments,
we
contend
that
we
carried
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
proceedings
now
in
consistent
with
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
the
hernandez
case
and
eubanks
case
and
various
other
cases.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
no
sir,
we
did
not
attack
petit
jury.
petit
jury
was
drawn
from
duplin
county
and
it
contained
a
large
number
of
persons
of
the
negro
race
on
the
petty
jury;
these
came
from
another
county,
in
fact
there
were
two
members
of
the
negro
race
on
the
trial
jury.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
(inaudible)
these
are
like
one
word
--
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
nothing
has
been
said
about
eligibility
and
we
failed
to
produce
any
evidence
of
eligibility
of
these
negros
for
jury
duty.
i
might
say
this
the
state
has
not
presented
any
evidence
to
show
that
the
whites
were
eligible
to
serve
on
these
same
juries
and
i
think
what's
fair
for
one
is
fair
for
the
other.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
thank
you
sir.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
on
the
motion
that
mr.
moody
has
referred
to
asking
for
a
private
mental
examination,
a
examination
by
private
psychiatrist,
our
chief
fault
found
that
the
examination
that
these
people
were
given,
these
two
defendant
were
given
is
that
we
obtained
an
order
from
the
clerk
--
from
the
judge
of
the
eight
judicial
district
requiring
that
these
men
be
observed
for
30
days
at
the
state
hospital
and
then
an
--
then
a
report
made
covering
their
mental
condition.
now
from
the
report
filed
which
is
not
in
the
record,
the
only
evidence
--
this
mental
examination
of
the
record
is
affidavit.
the
report
clearly
showed
and
that's
stated
in
the
affidavit
that
all
determinations
covering
the
sanity
or
insanity
of
these
defendants
were
made
at
a
time
considerably
prior
to
the
expiration
of
30
days.
now,
we
are
claiming
that
they
did
not
have
an
examination
as
ordered
by
the
court,
the
only
thing
that
we
are
claiming
in
that
regard.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
add
though,
we
pay
him
for
his
services
the
state
pays
it.
mr.
fred
w.
harrison
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
