(inaudible)
justice

r.
white
the
past
lists
are
preserved?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
turner,
the
evidence
that
clerk
(inaudible)
he
had,
well
they
had
only
seen
one
negro
in
24
years
who
had
actually
done
service,
he
had
seen
another
that
had
been
chosen
but
then
is
excused
because
he
lived
out
of
the
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
went
on
and
said
that,
said
there
aren't
that,
he
had
seen
negros
among
the
jury
panels
in
the
county
and
the
largest
number
he
had
seen
upon
the
regulatory
panel
at
one
time
was
four
or
five.
now,
i
think
that
if
that
means
that
i
don't
know
how
frequently
or
how
often
you
had
seen
four
or
five
jurors
on
the
jury
list
the
35
or
40.
i
take
it
that
that's
what
he
was
referring
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
so
the
discrimination
did
not
occur
at
the
time
of
the
inferences
anyway
the
discrimination
did
not
occur
at
the
time
the
35
or
40
which
shows
--
it
was
between
--
it
was
after
that
list
was
made
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
there
were
four
or
five
out
of
the
35
or
40,
only
one
in
24
years
have
actually
been
chosen
for
service
on
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
way
you
understand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
evidence,
this
is
the
only
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
reason
to
question
that
he
has
seen
forth.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
what
he
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
every
grand
jury
would
have
been
this
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
doesn't
restrict,
this
doesn't
this
is
wholly
decided
by
the
fact
that
that
even
though
they
were
four
to
five
on
the
--
they
were
four
or
five
on
every
list
nevertheless
only
one
in
24
years
has
actually
showed
up
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
might
end
up
30
or
40
names
in
box
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
it
in
24
years,
that
makes
430,
they
only
have
18
a
year
that
makes
432
jurors
that
are
picked
for
24
years
and
they've
got
two
negroes
(inaudible)
up
on
a
grand
jury
for
actual
service,
one
of
which
didn't
hear.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
prosecutor
had
do
otherwise
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
the
prosecutor
had
been
proved
otherwise
(inaudible),
that
there
had
been
more
than
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
it
seems,
every
now
and
then
seen
as
many
four
of
five.
justice
byron
r.
white
135
or
40.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
none
of
those
four
or
five
ever
show
up
on
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was
examined,
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
state
hospital?
