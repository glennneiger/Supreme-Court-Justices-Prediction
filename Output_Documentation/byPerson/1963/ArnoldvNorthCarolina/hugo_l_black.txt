colors
or
--?
justice

you
don't
know
whether
they
all
were

but
the
commissioners
have
them
in
two
boxes?

and
who
selects
them
and
how
do
they
select
it,
does
the
commissioner
do
it?

do
they
reach
down
themselves?

a
child
reaches
down
and
gets
the
name
of
the
jurors
to
serve
for
that
week.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
make
up
a
list?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
that
goes
into
the
courtroom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
first
nine
jurors
selected
are
the
ones
who
are
selected
for
the
grand
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
week?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
done
in

commissioner's
room?
justice

black
that's
the
second
time.
justice

them
up?

outside

courtroom?
justice

black
they
are
in

courtroom.
justice

l.
black
does
your
evidence
show
that
there
had
only
been
one
grand
juror
selected
in
24
years?
justice

black
selected
by
that

method

did
he

after

are
selected.

one
of
the
holdover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
going
on
the
basis
as
i
understand
(inaudible)
and
it
appears
that
over
a
period
of
a
long
number
of
years
no
colored
man
has
ever
served
on
the
grand
jury,
the
court
has
right
to
presume
(inaudible)
justice

then
it
was
wholly
accidental.
justice

black
they
wouldn't
take
judicial
notice
(inaudible)
justice

black
now
mr.
moody,
at
page
four
appears
this,
total
evidence
before
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
four
of
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
accept
that,
don't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
conclusive,
but
i
would
suppose
that
you
are
not
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
we
held
in
shea
versus
louisiana
very
much
situation
like
this
where
the
evidence
shows
that
no
grant
jury,
no
colored
grand
jury
for
a
number
of
years.
the
state
did
not
offer
to
refute
it,
that
the
fact
that
testimony
was
not
challenged
by
evidence,
could
not
be
brushed
aside,
had
there
been
evidence
obtainable
to
direct
contradict
to
prove
the
testimony
offered
by
petitioner
and
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
state
would
restrain
from
introducing
it,
that's
been
the
general
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
have
evidence
that
there
has
been
only
one
grand
juror,
colored
grand
juror
for
24
years
and
you
know
that
the
large
percentage
of
the
people
are
colored,
why
wouldn't
that
fit
that
precisely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
tax
list
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
shows
it
pretty
good
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
is
no
evidence
they
were
qualified
to
serve?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
also
held
that
later
in
shea
and
other
case
that
you
couldn't
simply
indict
the
whole
group
on
the
ground
or
on
the
assumption
that
none
were
able
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury.
it
seems
to
me
like,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
you
have
to
treat
this
case
on
the
basis
it's
a
very
large
percentage
of
people
are
colored,
for
24
years
according
to
the
evidence
which
the
state
didn't
see
fit
to
deny,
know
only
one
colored
man
to
have
served
on
the
grand
jury
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
issue
you
have
meet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
in
the
custody
of
the
state
clerk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
state
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
--
you
really
can't
argue
that
if
you
state
had,
had
evidence
that
this
wasn't
true,
that
we
should
assume
on
any
basis
that
they
wouldn't
have
put
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
all
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
one
in
this
process
that
i
have
not
thoroughly
understood
from
both
of
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
box
was
made
up,
put
in
their
name
and
put
in
the
box.
somebody
takes
out
35
at
some
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
judge
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right,
a
child
draws
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
the
child
--
who
arranges
them
when
they
go
up
into
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
take
them
up
in
upstairs
to
be
drawn
from,
the
clerk
of
the
board
puts
them
in
there,
somewhere
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
35
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
they
put
it
in
a
little
box?
