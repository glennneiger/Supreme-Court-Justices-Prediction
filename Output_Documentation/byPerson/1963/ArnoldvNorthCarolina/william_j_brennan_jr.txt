justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
get
this.
the
original
list
you
said
is
30
to
40.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
each
of
the
30
to
40,
the
subpoena
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there
is
a
list
publically
known
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
sheriff
makes
the
little
slips,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
take
it
any
one
is
examining
that
original
list
of
30
to
40
among
which
the
nine
are
selected
by
the
child
in
the
courtroom,
could
tell
readily
whether
they
are
all
white
or
all
--
any
negros
included.
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
interval
between
the
time
when
these
30
to
40
are
subpoenaed
and
the
day
when
the
child
in
the
courtroom
picks
out
the
nine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
list
at
least
is
publically
available
i
guess
for
three
or
four
weeks,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
the
real
--
if
there
is
a
deficiency
in
this
system,
the
exclusion
that
negroes
if
they
are
excluded
occurs
at
the
stage
when
the
30
to
40
are
selected
and
not
at
the
stage
where
the
child
selects
the
nine
from
a
box,
in
the
cigar
box.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah
i
suggest
it
perhaps
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's,
whatever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
last
question
mr.
turner,
when
does
the
sheriff
made
people
the
slips,
in
the
courtroom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
but
what
he
do,
come
into
the
courtroom
with
the
cigar
box
containing
slips?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
not
all
the
names
on
the
list
go
in
the
cigar
box?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
after
got
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
box
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
how
many
are
picked
out
and
put
in
box
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
is
this
done?
where
is
that
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
there
an
intermediate
step
there
that
is
of
screening
for
that
particular
term
with
25
or
30
whose
names
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
that's
done
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
done
on
the
presence
of
a
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
a
very
large
number
of
names.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
couple
of
thousand
you
would
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
consist
of
the
evidence
of
the
fact
that
provided
that
showing
the
total
amount
of
the
tax
abstracts
for
the
county
for
the
white
race
is
12,250,
the
total
amount
of
abstracts
for
the
colored
race
is
4,819,
the
white
(inaudible)
between
the
age
21
to
49,
5,583
for
white
and
2,499
for
the
colored.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see
this
--
but
you
don't
consider
that
evidence
of
racial
--
