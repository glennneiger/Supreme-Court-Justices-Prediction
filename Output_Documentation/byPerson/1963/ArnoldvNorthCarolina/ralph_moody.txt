mr.
ralph
moody
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
i
hope
i'm
not
to
be
bound
here
by
my
friends'
testimony
as
to
their
personal
recollections
of
what
happened
in
the
case
and
which
i
do
not
find
in
the
record.
the
court
--
if
the
court
is
interested
in
the
facts
of
case
of
course
you'll
find
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
which
is
appended
to
the
record.
it's
very
surprising
to
say
it
was
a
brutal
barbaric
murder
of
an
inoffensive
little
storekeeper
out
in
the
country
of
lenoir
county.
now
as
to
jury,
he
said
--
a
question
was
asked
of
course
and
less
--
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
on
the
petit
jury
which
the
justice
asked
about,
which
contained
40%
colored
people
and
60%
white,
14
were
called.
a
number
of
them
were
excused
as
they
have
scruples
against
capital
punishment
and
two
severed
on
the
jury,
so
that
is
that
and
may
it
please
this
court
so
for
as
the
petit
jury
is
concerned.
mr.
ralph
moody
why
did
they
come
from
the
other
county?
as
recited
in
the
order
of
the
court
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
thought
--
the
judge
thought
in
his
discretion
they
should
have
a
jury
from
another
county
to
obtain
a
fair
trail,
as
this
murder
was
well
known
and
communicated
all
around
in
lenoir
county
and
was
fair
to
these
defendants
to
have
a
panel
of
venire
from
another
county.
now
as
to
the
jury,
the
grand
jury,
my
friend
recited
a
system
about
organizing
the
grand
jury
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
at
all,
although
i
practiced
law
in
north
carolina
for
over
40
years.
in
the
first
place,
i
never
knew
that
the
sheriff
made
up
the
list,
unless
they've
got
a
local
statute
they
will
show
me.
they
have
appended
to
their
brief
and
we
appended
to
our
brief
the
same
statues
and
they're
in
their
appendix.
now
the
board
of
county
commissioners
has
a
clerk
of
it's
own.
it's
usually
--
the
registrar
of
deeds
is
usually
the
clerk
to
the
board
of
county
commissioners,
although
under
local
law
there
have
been
different
individuals,
that's
clerk
to
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
now
this
clerk
makes
up
a
list,
this
clerk
to
the
board
of
commissioners
makes
up
a
list
of
jurors
and
in
making
up
that
list
he
uses
tax
lists
and
they
advert
so
carefully
to
the
fact
that
we
keep
separate
lists
as
to
white
and
colored.
we
do
and
we
keep
separate
lists
as
to
indians
and
persons,
firms
and
corporations,
that
is
tax
a
matter
of
facility
in
handlings
tax
matters,
it
isn't
that
we
particularly
care
that
they
shall
be
shown
as
colored
and
others
shall
be
shown
as
white.
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that?
mr.
ralph
moody
well
(inaudible),
if
you've
got
an
officer
to
go
out
and
collect
some
taxes,
if
he
can
know
that
he's
colored
he
knows
where
to
go
and
look
for
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that?
yes
but
it
maybe
and
just
a
general
--
in
the
county
just
a
general
adverse
in
the
county.
we've
kept
those
lists
separate.
i
mean
that's
separate
for
oh
way
before
these
--
any
decisions
of
this
court
in
north
carolina
on
racial
discrimination
ideas
as
to
jury's
and
(inaudible).
i
can't
conceive
if
the
system
was
originally
setup
just
to
show
that
the
difference
between
colored
and
whites
anymore
to
show
that
some
was
corporations
and
some
were
indians,
we've
got
the
eastern
band
of
cherokee
indians
there
too.
now
this
clerk
makes
up
a
list
of
people
from
the
tax
list
and
the
polls,
the
regular
tax
payers
and
poll
tax
payers,
and
incidentally
the
payment
of
poll
tax
for
many
years
has
not
been
requirement
for
suffrage
in
our
state.
and
he
makes
that
typewritten
list
and
he
carries
it
the
board
of
commissioners,
and
they
go
over
the
list
and
as
you
will
see
from
statutes,
the
standards
of
their
passing
on
it
is
character
and
intelligence.
they
then
cut
this
list
into
scrolls,
these
little
smaller
scrolls
and
i
never
heard
of
a
cigar
box
in
my
jurist
system
before.
they
have
a
box
that's
specially
made
and
it
has
two
compartments,
box
number
one
and
box
number
two,
it's
made
all
together
but
it
has
two
compartments
and
then
you
put
--
after
you
cut
your
scrolls,
you
put
them
all
in
box
number
one.
there
are
two
locks
to
that
box,
one
officer
has
the
key
to
one
compartment,
a
separate
officer
has
a
key
to
the
other
compartment.
they
are
two
compartments
and
two
locks
to
the
box.
now
after
this
list
is
made
up
and
the
scrolls
are
cut
and
put
in
box
number
one,
then
the
child
comes
and
they're
stirred
up
and
the
child
draws
the
scrolls
for
the
jury
list
for
that
coming
court.
and
the
grand
--
they
are
all
drawn
together.
they
are
all
drawn
grand
and
petit
together,
they
are
all
drawn
together
and
as
they're
drawn
from
box
one
they
are
put
over
into
box
two,
until
that
--
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
moody
they
in
total
let
you
draw
out.
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
well
the
whole
system
--
well
see
the
juries
are
revised
every
two
years,
but
the
whole
system
--
the
jury
list
is
revised
every
two
years,
but
the
whole
group
of
names
cut
from
the
scrolls,
we'll
say
2000,
3000
are
all
put
in
box
one.
mr.
ralph
moody
one.
mr.
ralph
moody
whatever
their
requirement
is,
they
have
grand
jury
system
i
think,
a
staggered
system,
you
pick
up
nine
new
ones
every
year,
i
think
that's
right.
nine
every
six
months
and
he
says
that,
and
they
draw
then
25
or
30,
but
they
all
drawn
together,
now
let's
follow
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
done
in
--
usually
from
my
experience
it's
done
in
the
county
commissioner's
office.
mr.
ralph
moody
for
that
drawing
and
go
over
into
box
two,
but
they
make
the
list
of
what
they
draw.
they
and
as
a
list
he's
talking
about,
that's
carried
to
court,
up
into
court
and
cut
into
scrolls
again,
that's
a
new
list,
cut
into
scrolls
again.
mr.
ralph
moody
oh
in
the
mean
time
the
administrative
process
of
having
them
summoned
our
subpoenaed
and
court
goes
on,
yes.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
done
before
we
reach
court.
then
we
get
to
the
court
and
cut
the
names
after
they've
already
been
summoned,
mr.
justice
brennan,
after
they
have
already
been
summoned,
then
we
cut
the
names
and
put
them
in
a
box
they
had
and
maybe
you
might
find
a
cigar
box
there,
put
them
in
a
name
in
a
hat
and
they're
all
stirred
up
and
a
child
again
comes
into
the
process.
then
usually
the
normal
procedure
is
the
first
18
names
drawn
is
grand
jury,
but
here
every
six
months
would
be
the
first
nine
names
i
take
it
go.
mr.
ralph
moody
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
and
in
the
court.
now
if
there
is
any
particular
tampering
that
can
be
done,
that
they
talk
about
here
and
things
like
that
to
be
done
which
they
haven't
proved
incidentally,
my
notion
would
be
that
it
would
be
done
when
the
clerk
first
makes
up
the
list
from
the
tax
list
and
he
can
use
any
approved
list,
telephone
directories,
city
directories,
he
can
use
anything
he
wants
to
get
that
list
from.
now
there
could
be
a
discriminatory
selection
there
that
i
admit
when
he
first
makes
that
up
original
number
that's
carried
to
commissioners
that
they
pass
on
and
then
cut
in
the
scrolls.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
a
large
number
of
names.
mr.
ralph
moody
well
depending
on
the
county,
for
size
county
(inaudible)
that
would
be
several
thousands,
and
here
i
don't
know
how
many
they
would
carry
to
their
box
down
there.
as
your
honor
knows
we
don't
reach
these
cases
expect
at
the
appellant
level,
we
don't
prosecute
in
the
lower
court.
now
then
we
don't
know,
and
he
says
he's
carried
the
burden,
well
now
let's
see
if
he
has
carried
the
burden,
outside
of
his
own
testimony
he
gave
here.
he
asked
the
tax
supervisor,
he
put
the
tax
supervisor
on
the
witness
stand,
and
mr.
guy
williams,
melvin
guy
williams,
now
bear
in
mind
we
have
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
this
case
as
to
population
ratios,
not
a
thing
in
the
world,
he
cites
all
these
other
case
as
to
population
ratios,
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
that
i
can
find
in
this
record
as
to
population
ratio.
mr.
ralph
moody
you
can,
yes
sir.
but
he
has
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
it
as
far
as
we
were
supposed
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
in
an
actual
trial
and
he
mentioned
the
case
that
where
in
harris
county,
they
found
that
3,600
colored
people
were
eligible
for
jury
duty
and
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
the
scottsburg
cases
and
atlanta
cases,
they
were
shown
to
be
many,
many
eligible
negros
and
that
was
put
in
the
record
of
the
evidence,
many
eligible
negros,
doctors,
insurance
men,
funeral
directors
and
people
like
that
in
the
scottsburg
cases,
he
didn't
show
or
put
a
scrap
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
is
a
single
eligible
negro
in
the
county
to
serve
on
the
jury
that
could
meet
the
character
and
intelligent
test.
mr.
ralph
moody
page
what
sir?
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
not
arguing
that
he
didn't
show
what's
on
the
text
abstracts,
he
did.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
do,
i
consider
that
that's
some
evidence
yes.
i
don't
come
out
or
argue
that
against
that
at
all,
but
i
say
he
didn't
show
any
population
rise
shows
or
anything
like
that.
now
what
did
he
asked
the
clerk?
first
place,
now
i
have
the
state
transcript
here.
i
think
the
stenographic
report
of
a
trial
and
i
think
you
have
that,
it
was
filed
here
in
the
certiorari
proceedings.
in
the
first
place
the
state
transcript
will
show
you
they
never
even
asked
mr.
williams
what
was
the
constitution
of
the
present
grand
jury
at
all.
the
court
asked
that
and
he
said
he
didn't
know
and
the
court
said
and
that's
in
this
record
that
he
--
after
he
had
asked
william
about
the
constitution
of
this
grand
jury
the
indicted
these
petitioners,
he
said
--
the
court
said
i
know
about
that.
i
mean
he
said
he
didn't
know
about
it
and
the
court
said
well
i
do,
but
court
didn't
say
what
it
was
and
i
don't
know.
then
the
clerk
testified
that
in
his
24
years,
he
had
only
the
one
negro
and
the
other
one
maybe
that
was
came
up
and
it
was
shown
lived
in
another
county,
but
i
do
know
what
24
period
of
time
his
reminiscence
is
those
over
there.
is
that
--
does
the
organization
of
this
grand
jury,
is
that
annexed
to
this
record
of
recollection
or
is
it
not,
i
don't
know
and
he
didn't
say
and
they
didn't
see
fit
to
ask
the
clerk
if
he
knew
the
organization
of
the
grand
jury
that
found
these
bills
of
indictment.
mr.
ralph
moody
sir
i
don't
know.
he
says
and
i
suppose
he
knows,
but
that's
a
more
--
i
am
hope
i'm
not
bound
by
in
the
record.
mr.
ralph
moody
well
they
only
picked
--
i
don't
know,
but
they
only
picked
up
nine
every
six
months
and
i
do
know
they
were
--
but
their
own
evidence
shows
--
mr.
ralph
moody
within
the
fallible
recollection
of
this
clerk.
mr.
ralph
moody
well.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir,
i
don't
--
it's
evidence
i
hope
it
isn't
conclusive
evidence.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
agree
it's
evidence
mr.
justice
black,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
he
might
have
mr.
justice
white,
but
lots
of
times
as
a
lawyer
you
know
that
they
prefer
to
rely
weakness
of
the
case
rather
than
to
put
on
evidence
to
overcome
it
and
it
maybe
he
was
in
a
hard
place,
i
don't
know,
i
wasn't
there.
but
i
do
know,
i
would
say
this
to
you
mr.
justice
white
and
to
the
court
that
they
were
--
they
are
bound
to
abandon
negroes
in
the
jury
box
because
their
own
witness
says
that
he
had
seen
quite
a
few
on
the
jury
panels
and
that
–
mr.
ralph
moody
four
of
five
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
he
says
now
from
his
personal
recollection
he
comes
up
here
and
he
is
seeing
four
and
five
if
that
was
a
new
thing,
well
they've
been
seen
that
before,
his
own
witness
said
so.
mr.
ralph
moody
they
did
not
as
far
as
i
know,
i
mean
i
only
know
of
course
what
the
record
says,
but
we
told
and
i
still
argue
to
this
court
when
a
state
is
brought
here
for
indictment
before
the
bar
of
this
great
court
that
that's
too
flimsy
of
evidence
to
indict
the
state
on.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
think
so,
but
didn't
you
have
more
evidence
in
that
face
than
they
have
here?
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
know
the
large
--
or
what
percentage
of
your
honor
is
colored
other
than
the
tax
list.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
tax
list
rather
showed
some
yes.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right
they
do.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir
but
there
are
people
in
scottsburg
cases
for
example
like
taylor
against
alabama
and
norris,
in
those
cases
they
saw
fit,
i
think
mr.
(inaudible)
which
in
that
case
they
saw
fit
to
show
the
competency
of
a
large
group
of
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
they
don't
make
it
such
strange
thing
when
they
only
pick
up
nine
ever
six
months
and
out
of
the
--
unless
i
knew
the
list
what
the
list
it
was.
now
bear
in
mind
mr.
justice
black
that
the
total
number
of
names
of
everybody
who
had
served
on
the
grand
jury
for
many,
many
years
and
decades
back
is
there
in
a
book
and
is
typewritten
out
and
put
in
a
loose
leaf
book
with
a
hardback
binding.
it's
in
there,
all
they
had
to
do
is
bring
it
out.
mr.
ralph
moody
all
they
had
to
do
--
mr.
ralph
moody
it
is
in
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir,
but
they
can
get
it
by
going
down
there,
nobody
withholds
that
book.
mr.
ralph
moody
i'd
feel
better
if
they
got
the
box
and
pulled
the
names
out
and
had
got
the
book
and
said
here
they
are.
i
do
know
in
previous
cases
that's
the
way
it
has
been
handled.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
not
in
all,
and
from
my
state.
but
that
--
they
go
get
the
box
the
petitioner's
attorney
though
they
subpoenaed,
there
is
nobody
withholds
it.
take
a
scroll
down
and
look
at
them
and
identify
them,
go
get
the

the
commissioner's
office,

there
is
no
judge

but
at
that
time
the
chairman
of
the
board
is
there
and
a
child
draws

mr.
ralph

and
they
take
--
mr.

list.
mr.

on
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
he
just
writes
the
list
out
on
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
he
may
have
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
do
it,
sometimes
they
change
jobs,
but
that
goes
up
to
the
court
on
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
ralph
moody
they
cut
it
then
and
put
it
in
another
box.
they
cut
the
names
then,
cut
them
into
little
scrolls
again
and
those
names
go
into
the
box
or
have
--
they
are
stirred
up
and
a
child
draws
again.
mr.
ralph
moody
well
mr.
chief
justice,
one,
i
want
to
know
what
statue
says,
that
the
clerk
of
the
board
of
the
county
commissioners
assess
jury
commissions
in
making
up
the
list
of
names,
to
be
laid
before
the
board
of
county
commissioners
are
such
jury
commission
sometime
we
have
a
jury
commission
tell
the
board
of
county
commissioners,
may
secure
said
list
from
such
sources
of
information
as
deemed
reliable
and
which
will
provide
the
names
of
persons
of
the
county
above
21
years
of
age
residing
with
the
county,
qualified
for
jury
duty.
that
shall
be
excluded
from
said
list
all
those
persons
who
have
convicted
crimes,
involving
moral
turpitude
or
who
have
been
adjudged
to
be
non-competent
men.
now
he
uses
the
tax
list,
he
uses
telephone
directories,
he
uses
trade
commerce
clubs
and
trade
directories
and
city
directories
and
if
he
works
and
selects
them,
he
could
use
those.
now
if
you
say
though
that
there
are
some
mandatory
standard
to
something
that
he
shall
do
this,
that
or
the
other
notion
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
he
could
yeah.
mr.
ralph
moody
but,
i
won't
in
absence
of
evidence
and
i
hope
you
won't
assume
he
did.
mr.
ralph
moody
yeah
sir,
but
one
clerk
says
and
thinks
and
remembers
and
there
was
the
books
with
all
of
them
that's
not
shown.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir,
we
don't.
we've
gone
there
but
they
have
to
be
checked
we
don't
really
know
anymore
about
it
than
they
do.
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
no
mention
to
that,
i
have
never
seen
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
had
shows
that
in
that
book
there
is
any
designation
colored
or
white,
that's
names.
mr.
ralph
moody
usually
in
the
cases
that
i've
been
in
they
check
them.
you
have
people
there,
you
have
a
sheriff
who
served
for
a
long
time,
you
have
somebody
that's
been
there
for
a
long
time
and
when
a
name
is
put
up
and
asked
about
they
can
say
yes
he
is
white
or
he
is
colored.
these
are
not
metropolitan
centers
mr.
goldberg,
justice
goldberg.
mr.
ralph
moody
that
is
a
method
that
i
know
of,
the
only
method
i
know
of.
mr.
ralph
moody
recollections
of
people
as
we
have
to
allow
most
evidence
that
i
know
about.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
attack
the
clerk
of
the
court
anymore
than
i
think
that
it's
over
a
period
of
24
years,
i
don't
think
anybody
can
be
charged
with
a
great
deal
of
accuracy,
when
suddenly
confronted
as
to
what
he
remembers
back
over
that
span
of
time.
now,
they
were
--
they
raise
a
question
here,
i
don't
--
i
haven't
been
asked
about
it,
but
they
raise
a
question
here
your
honor
about
that
continues
and
that
we
should
have
provided
them
with
examination
by
psychiatrist,
say
private
practicing
psychiatrist.
now,
our
court
didn't
pass
on
that
as
a
constitutional
question,
they
had
supposed
a
motion
of
continuums
as
a
matter
of
discretion
which
is
local
state
practice.
and
if
the
court
is
going
to
investigate
the
question
as
to
whether
we
should
furnish
them
with
a
private
psychiatrist
or
not,
there
are
two
answers
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
one
is,
you
held
of
course
we've
got
to
provide
counsel
you
have
entailed
under
the
for
protection
clause
and
due
process
clause
what
we
have
to
provide
by
a
way
of
witnesses
of
expert
witnesses.
mr.
ralph
moody
he
was
examined.
mr.
ralph
moody
yeah
at
the
state
hospital,
we
sent
them
both
for
examination
and
their
motion
was
of
course
that
they
hadn't
had
time,
they
said
to
prepare
although
the
state
transcript
will
show
you
they
had
60
days.
mr.
ralph
moody
it's
poor
pay,
your
honor.
