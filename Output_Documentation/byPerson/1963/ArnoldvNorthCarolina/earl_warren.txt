number
572,
jesse
james
arnold
and
george
dixon,
petitioners,
versus
north
carolina.
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
in
the
middle
of
the
term.
chief
justice
earl
warren
middle
of
the
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
are
on
that
list?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
are
they
selected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harrison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
come
from
the
other
county
mr.
moody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
you
possibly
explain
that
where
there
were
these
many
negroes
in
the
county
and
a
number
of
them
that
were
on
the
tax
rolls
that
would
only
be
one
negro
on
a
grand
jury
in
24
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moody
are
there
any
standards
that
the
clerk
of
the
board
of
commissioners
must
follow
in
making
this
original
list?
are
there
any
rules
he
must
go
by
or
any
standards
that
he
must
meet
or
does
he
just
do
it
in
according
to
his
own
conscience,
of
his
own
belief
as
to
who
is
qualified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
but
he
could,
the
system
is
open
to
his
using
his
bias
if
he
decides
to
do
it
against
the
negro
race,
by
not
putting
any
of
them
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
could
and
there
is
nothing
to
check
that
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
there
some
evidence
that
there
never
was
one
on
the
grand
--
never
but
one
on
the
grand
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
well
isn't
it
a
rather
heavy
burden
to
put
on
an
indigent
defendant
who
has
to
have
counsel
appointed
for
him
to
go
back
over
that
list
for
24
years
to
see
what
negros
have
ever
been
on
the
jury,
when
the
state
has
it
and
knows
positively
whether
they
were
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah
you
mean
the
--
you
mean
the
clerk
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
unreliable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harrison,
before
you
sit
down
on
behalf
of
the
court
that
i
shall
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
and
mr.
turner
for
having
undertaken
the
defense
of
these
indigent
defendants
as
a
public
service.
we
are
always
gratified
and
comforted
by
the
fact
that
there
are
lawyers
who
will
take
these
unpopular
causes
and
who
will
defend
indigent
defendants
as
a
public
service
and
so
we
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done.
and
mr.
moody
thank
you
sir,
for
the
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
people
of
the
state
of
the
north
carolina.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
still
thank
you.
