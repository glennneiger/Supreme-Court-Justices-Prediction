mr.
j.
harvey
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
defendant
arnold,
having
been
appointed
in
the
trial
court
below,
arnold
who
is
a
member
of
the
negro
race.
the
case
he
is
here
on
certiorari
because
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
which
affirmed
a
conviction
of
these
two
defendants
for
murder
perpetrated
in
a
robbery.
in
due
course,
in
the
trial
court,
each
defendant
made
timely
motions
to
quash
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
member
of
their
race
had
been
systemically
excluded
from
jury
duty
in
the
county.
these
motions
were
overruled.
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
the
trail
court
was
sustained
in
that
and
it
was
held
that
we
had
failed
to
carry
the
burden
of
showing
systematic
exclusion.
in
the
trial
court,
we
called
two
witnesses.
we
called
the
county
tax
supervisor,
mr.
williams
and
he
testified
as
to
his
records,
tax
abstracts
and
listings
of
full
tax
which
were
kept
separately
and
as
he
said
it
would
required
to
be
kept
separate
as
to
white
and
member
of
the
negro
race,
required
by
law.
but
under
his
figures
as
to
his
tax
abstracts,
approximately
39%
of
the
population
of
lenoir
county
is
comprised
of
member
of
the
negro
race.
we
then
turned
to
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court,
the
trial
court,
the
court
in
which
these
defendants
were
tried
and
he
said
--
he
testified
that
he
had
been
clerk
of
that
court
for
24
years
and
during
that
time
one
member
of
the
negro
race
had
served
or
i
believe
the
word
he
used,
has
served,
he
was
not
serving
at
the
time
these
two
defendants
petitioners
were
indicted
and
tried.
we
think
the
question
presented
is
--
boils
down
to
simple
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
carried
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
systematic
exclusion
of
member
of
the
negro
race
from
jury
duty
in
lenoir
county,
and
we
think
we
have
without
any
question.
and
under
numerous
decisions
of
this
court,
eubanks
and
hernandez
case
in
particular,
there
are
other
cases,
hill
against
texas
and
smith
against
texas.
in
the
hill
against
texas
case
were
50,000
white
persons,
8,000
negros,
if
they
pooled
tax
in
dallas
county.
in
a
period
of
16
years
no
negro
had
served
on
the
grand
jury
of
that
county.
the
court
held
that
the
petitioner
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion.
in
smith
against
texas,
petitioner
showed
20%
of
the
population
was
made
up
of
negros,
10%
of
the
poll
tax
payers
were
negros
and
from
1931
to
1938
there
were
384
grand
juries,
out
of
which
only
five
were
negros.
there
were
3,000
to
6,000
negros
qualified
for
grand
jury
service
in
harris
county.
the
court
says
chancellor
eisner
alone
could
hardly
have
brought
about
the
listing
for
grand
jury
service
of
so
few
negros.
as
i
say
the
question
is
simple,
we
think
we
have
carried
the
burden
of
proof
and
we
introduced
the
evidence
we
did
in
support
of
our
motion,
we
think
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
state.
the
state
introduced
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
refute
the
evidence
we
had
put
in
as
to
the
composition
of
the
people,
tax
rolls
of
lenoir
county.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
would
say
that
would
have
no
difference
whatsoever
sir.
we
could
have
brought
the
box
in,
but
as
it
is
handled
in
our
county,
our
board
of
county
commission's
the
governing
body,
selects
those
people
who
are
to
serve
on
the
jury,
jury
duty
for
up
coming
terms
of
court.
and
i
might
say
i
recall
the
particular
time
when
this
one
negro
served
on
grand
jury
and
that
was
approximately,
it
was
about
seven
or
eight
years
ago
from
that.
they
just
have
not
had
it.
we
--
as
the
clerk
testified
usually
for
a
term
of
court
we
have
about
35,
possibly
40
jurors
selected
for
a
week's
term
of
court.
and
on
numerous
terms
of
court
we
had
no
negros
whatsoever
on
the
petit
jury.
sometimes
we
have
one,
two
or
three.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
the
boxers
i
think
are
in
the
custody
of
the
registrar
of
deeds
who
is
secretary
to
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
we
say
that
once
we
show
that
make
up
of
the
population
of
lenoir
county,
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
state
to
who
there
had
been
no
systematic
exclusion.
i
would
like
to
take
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
way
that's
done
your
honor
is
this.
at
the
january
term
in
lenoir
county,
a
criminal
term
we
draw
from
the
list
of
jurors
someone
for
that
term
of
court,
none
names.
now
those
names
are
made
up
like
this.
the
sheriff
types
up
a
list
of
the
perspective
jurors.
then
these
lists,
each
little
individual
slip
of
paper
with
a
name
on
it
is
torn
off
and
put
into
a
cigar
box
and
then
they
have
some
little
child
come
up
and
draw
names
out
of
the
box.
now,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
sheriff
automatically
eliminates
the
names
of
negros,
we
don't
know
how
it
is
done.
the
only
thing
is
we
know
it
is
done,
because
this
thing
couldn't
happen
by
chance,
not
over
the
years
and
years
with
the
population
we
have
of
negros,
it
just
wouldn't
work.
now
in
this
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
we
do
not
call
him
because
if
we
had
called
the
county
commissioners
or
if
we
had
called
the
sheriff
we
would
have
run
into
the
same
obstacle
that
they
ran
into
the
in
the
eubanks
case
and
i
think
also
in
the
hernandez
case
and
maybe
several
other
cases.
as
in
the
eubanks
case,
they
brought
in
the
jury
commission,
five
of
them
as
i
recall
and
i
think
some
are
made
up
of
judges
and
say
they
interviewed,
they
discussed,
and
they
selected
these
jurors
and
say
they
would
try
to
be
fair
and
impartial
in
it
and
that's
a
far
as
they
went.
but
the
court
in
the
case
says,
when
a
jury
selection
plan,
whatever
it
is,
operates
in
such
as
way
as
always
to
result
in
complete
and
long
continued
exclusion
of
any
representative
at
all
from
a
large
group
of
negros
over
any
other
racial
group,
indictments,
and
verdicts
returned
against
him
by
juries
thus
selected
cannot
stand,
and
referring
to
what
the
jury
selection
commission
had
to
say,
the
court
said
this.
true
the
judges
now
serving
on
the
local
court
testified
generally
that
they
had
not
discriminated
against
the
negros
in
choosing
grand
juries
and
had
only
tried
to
pick
the
best
available,
but
the
court
said
if
they
were
to
hold
--
go
along
with
that
idea
or
that
testimony
it
would
be
a
vein
and
illusory
requirement
that
they
have
equal
representation.
we
think
the
matter
is
clear.
we
do
not
think
it
required
a
great
deal
of
argument.
we
think
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state.
the
state
did
not
meet
its
burden,
we
don't
think
it
could
have
met
its
burden
if
it
had
tried.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
one
actually
served
on
the
grand
jury
in
the
past
24
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir.
the
only
way
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
take
the
little
box
that
the
sheriff
prepares.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
that
was
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
that
was
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
he
did
not
control
that,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
might.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
can
--
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
before
the
judge
excuses
anybody,
he
excuses
anybody
for
--
to
be
excused
from
jury
duty
at
least
two
terms
of
court,
january
and
august.
the
names
of
the
nine
new
grand
jurors
are
drawn
before
anybody
is
exempt
from
jury
duty
for
that
time
of
court.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
i
don't
think
it
actually
in
the
record.
i
think
probably
the
statute
may
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
think
probably
the
statue
controls
that.
the
statues
covering
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
county
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir,
we
have
a
staggered
--
for
continuity
purposes
nine
coming
on
in
august
and
nine
coming
on
in
january.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
well
as
i
say
the
sheriff
of
the
county;
he
comes
in
with
a
tight
list
of
persons.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
he
makes
it
up
form
the
jury
list
of
jurors
selected
for
that
term
of
court.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
jury
list
comes
from
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
approximately
35,
36,
it
varies
anywhere
from
30
to
40.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
they
have
two
boxes.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
they
--
each
two
years.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
county
commissioners.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
prospective
jurors,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
commissioners,
it
is
handled
through
commissioners
at
their
meetings
at
least
three
weeks
prior
to
court.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no,
i
think
they
used
a
child
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
think
a
child
does
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir.
to
select
the
grand
jury
we
use
a
--
the
sheriff
takes
--
makes
a
list
of
the
persons
who
have
been
subpoenaed
for
jury
service.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
he
then
takes
that
list
and
then
makes
little
smaller
strips
of
--
what
he
does,
he
types
the
list
on
one
page
and
then
the
cuts
under
each
name,
where
each
name
appears
a
one
small
slip
of
paper,
then
each
slip
of
paper
is
put
in
a
cigar
box
and
they
have
some
child
under
ten
years
of
age
draw
out
a
slip
and
they
draw
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
that
is
done
in
court
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
but
that
is
purely
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
but
that
is
purely
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
new
grand
jury
members.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
sheriff.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
they
are
in
the
courtroom
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
that
same
method.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
although
the
member
of
the
negro
race
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
if
he
was
very
well
known
around
the
county
yes
he
could
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
names
are
drawn,
i
believe
the
statute
requires
it's
three
or
four
weeks
before
a
term
of
court.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
it
is
publically
available
i
would
say
approximately
three
weeks
before
hand.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
past
list,
no.
the
list
that
is
preserved
--
yes
it
goes
into
the
meeting
of
the
county
board
of
commissioners.
yes
sir,
it
does,
but
the
sheriff
then
he
subpoenas
these
people
and
he
does
not
necessarily
make
a
postal
service,
he
could
do
it
by
postal
card
and
if
the
person
receives
it,
the
recipient
is
supposed
to
return
the
card
back
and
say
i
received
the
card.
if
it
is
not
received
back,
by
then
the
sheriff
says
he
was
not
served
and
the
man
is
not
subpoenaed
for
jury
service.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
think
that
although
as
we
cannot,
we
cannot
find
out,
we
cannot
get
all
the
information
we
would
like,
we
get
to
run
around
if
we
try
to.
there
is
only,
the
other
stage
that
it
could
be
done
is
this,
the
sheriff
in
making
up
his
list
to
go
into
the
little
cigar
box,
could
eliminate
the
names
of
negroes.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
don't
know
where
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
i
don't
know,
i
do
not
know
where
this
occurs,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
i
know
is
it
occurs
some
place
down
the
line.
although
since
this
case
has
a
reason,
and
since
we,
since
this
court
granted
certiorari,
at
terms
of
court
we
usually
have
five
or
maybe
six,
maybe
those
subpoenaed
for
jury
duty.
and
on
the
list
that
is
prepared
and
sent
out
with
the
trial
calendar
if
a
man
is
a
member
of
the
negro
race
he
has
in
parenthesis
after
or
before
the
township
from
which
he
comes,
the
word
or
the
abbreviation
c-o-l
which
we
all
take
to
mean
colored.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
list,
since
this
case
has
risen
we
have
taken
it
up
on
this
point.
we
now
have
approximately
i'd
say
four
to
six
negroes
subpoenaed
for
jury
service,
that
is
now,
not
before
this
case,
but
since
this
case.
and
on
this
calendar
that
comes
out
they
send
a
trail
calendar,
the
cases
to
be
tried
to
the
members
of
the
bar
and
also
the
list
of
the
jurors
who
are
subpoenaed
for
that
term
of
court
and
now
we
have
four,
five
or
six
negroes,
but
you
can
tell
which
is
a
negro
because
after
his
name
or
after
his
--
the
township
from
which
he
comes
from
on
the
list
is
the
abbreviation
c-o-l,
which
the
court
uses
to
mean
a
colored
person.
so
that
the
bar
or
anybody
else
understood
although
ahead
of
time
that
perspective
juror
is
a
member
of
the
negro
race.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
the
judge,
the
judge.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
it's
after
they
select,
he'll
see
ask
the
--
if
it
sustains--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir,
if
a
sustained
judge
around
he'll
take
one
of
the
whole
over
nine,
the
sustained
judge,
he'll
ask
the
clerk
to
maybe
enquire
the
sheriff
who
he
thinks
wanted
to
be
appointed.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
he
appoints,
the
new,
the
newly
appointed
foreman
is
one
of
the
holdover
nine.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir,
well
that
has
been
the
custom
now,
a
judge
could
appoint
one
of
the
new
members,
but
i
haven't
seen
that
done.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
lived
out
of
county.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
which
is
what
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
that
is
the
tenor
of
what
he
says
but
it
does
not
go
far,
you
know
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no,
he
has
but
i
would,
i
would,
what
i
actually
say,
it
has
been
very
infrequent
or
it
had
been
up
until
this
case
arose.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir
--
i
mean
pursuing
is
just
like
getting
the
county
commissioners
in
there
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
what
he
said,
it
could
have
been
once
a
year,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
it
won't.
i
know
to
my
own
knowledge
it
was
not
that
way,
i
mean
of
course
his
testimony
could
be
construed
that
way,
but
he
says,
he
has
seen
that
many.
you
could
also
interpret
that
to
mean
that
--
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir
and
it
was
really
9
out
of
36,
had
about
a
25
out
of
106.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
he
makes
them
up
sometime
prior
to
going
to
court.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
no
sir,
he
goes
into
court
with
a
little
--
one
piece
of
paper
with
the
slips,
cut
down
to
side
and
he
tears,
tears
the
slips
off
from
a
sheet
of
paper
and
puts
them
into
cigar
box.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
it's
a
possibility
i
do
not
know
sir.
all
i
know
is
this,
if
there
is
some
place
and
if
we
would
try
to
pin
it
down
by
getting
to
county
commissioner
all
that
we'd
run
to
the
same
type
answers
you
get
in
all
these
other
cases
where
its
been,
they
say
we
try
not
to
discriminate,
we
try
to
pick
a
fair
jury
and
none
of
the
cases,
i
don't
see
i
can
possibly
state.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
harvey
turner
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
think
the
burden
when
we
show
that,
the
burden
automatically
shifts
to
the
state,
goes
up
to
state
to
show
there
was
no
discrimination,
automatic,
systematic
exclusion.
thank
you.
