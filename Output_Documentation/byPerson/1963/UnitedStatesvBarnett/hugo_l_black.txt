justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
it
provide
that
the
jury
must
be
selected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
the
constitution
provides?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
after
the
constitution
was
adopted,
the
trial
occurred
in
the
supreme
court
in
which
the
court
called
upon
a
jury
and
tried
it
before
you
and
charging
the
jury
would
be
judge
of
both
the
law
and
the
fact.
from
what
area
was
that
jury
selected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
brailsford
against
georgia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
that
brought
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
philadelphia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
point,
as
far
as
it's
concerned,
does
not
depend
at
all
on
the
question
of
where
the
case
would
filed
but
where
jurors
would
have
to
come
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
--
what
you're
arguing
is
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
isn't
wherever
the
constitution
required
a
crime
to
be
trialed.
they
are
required
by
the
constitution
to
give
a
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
go
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
so
far
as
your
argument
goes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you're
arguing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume,
if
you're
arguing
the
policy,
you
would
say
that
where
the
judge
tried
the
case
and
somebody
threw
an
inkwell
at
him
was
a
typical
example
of
why
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
constitution
provided
that
there
should
be
trial
by
juries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
juries
drawn
generally
from
the
community,
not
biased
on
one
side
or
the
other.
so,
i
suppose
the
judge
would
be
slightly
biased
if
the
man
had
thrown
an
inkwell
at
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
kind
of
cases
was
that
authority
given?
how
broad
is
it?
i
haven't
looked
at
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law,
what
kind
of
cases
can
the
attorney
general
appear
in
and
make
it
a
government
case,
insofar
as
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
concerned
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
authority
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
abstract
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
is
he
allowed?
what
kind
of
--
can
--
as
between
any
two
litigants
in
the
court,
does
that
mean
--
i'm
asking
you
this
to
find
out,
does
that
mean
that
the
attorney
general
can
appear
and
whenever
he,
by
his
own
choice,
decides
to
appear,
that
deprives
a
man
of
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
which
he
would
otherwise
have
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
to
be
true,
that
i
fully
agree
with
what
you've
said
about
the
necessity
of
the
government
having
that
power
and
wisdom
in
its
exercise
is
necessary
to
achieve
end
to
justice.
what
i'm
asking
is
with
reference
to
a
situation
where
the
statement
is
and
may
be
a
threat
that
when
the
attorney
general
does
appear,
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
of
the
litigants
as
bequeathed,
which
existed
before,
can
be
taken
away
by
his
mere
choice
of
the
appearing
in
the
court.
what
kind
of
cases
are
those?
are
they
limited
in
any
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
--
in
a
statutory
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
the
limitation
is
whatever
this
court
could
be
persuaded
was
too
much
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
would
give
it
in
every
kind
of
case,
except
a
crime
that
involves
the
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
my
statement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wrong
that
you
believe
in
the
trial
by
jury,
as
the
constitution
guarantees
it,
in
the
case
of
every
kind
of
crime
except
one
which
involves
a
crime
connected
with
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
finding
of
the
jury
that
convicted
william
--
refused
to
convict
william
penn,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
got
to
have
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
kind
of
court
order
so
that
the
jury
couldn't
decide
the
case
if
it's
too
dangerous.
