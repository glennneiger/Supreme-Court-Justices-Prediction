justice
potter
stewart
was
mr.
justice
black's
order
itself
in
the
nature
of
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
had
the
--
any
conduct
here
was
not
even
arguably
any
contempt
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
is
intended
of
any
(inaudible)
that
the
language
embraces
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
argument.
i
think
you
--
you
set
out
fairly
the
argument.
it
is
only
as
i
understand
it
and
i
may,
i
may
misunderstand
you
but
it's
only
that
--
or
it's
basically
that
if
the
person
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
criminal
contempt
--
contempt
proceeding,
then
it's
a
denial
--
perhaps
a
denial
for
equal
protection,
i
grant
you
that's
not
on
the
fifth
amendment
but
the
bolling
against
sharpe
as
a
--
that
it's
a
denial,
some
--
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
right
not
to
accord
him
--
not
to
accord,
states
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
the
shipp
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
--
how
common
is
it
that
--
how
many
times
have
ever
been
criminal
contempt
proceedings
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
you
found
that
many?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
in
an
order
magnitude.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
your
point
is
that
in
this
case,
and
in
the
court
which
is
the
unpopular
minority?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
an
argument
that
you
--
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unpopular
criminal
defendant,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
such
cases
where
the
man
put
to
trial
by
jury
was
made
and
it
was
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
mr.
clark,
that
you,
in
answer
to
my
brother
goldberg's
question,
concede
that
if,
during
the
course
of
a
trial,
one
of
the
witnesses
or
one
of
the
spectators
threw
a
bottle
of
ink
at
the
judge
and
hit
him
on
the
head
and
--
two
or
three
times,
that
the
judge
would
have
summary
power
to
hold
him
in
criminal
contempt
and
sentence
him
to
jail
for
30
days?did
you
concede
that
they
--
yes,
he
has
power?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
what
happens
to
your
constitutional
argument
if,
for
the
purposes
of
your
argument
here,
you
make
that
concession
and
you
told
us
before
you
can't
--
the
constitution
either
goes
all
the
way
or
it
doesn't
and
yet,
this
is
--
if
you
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
you
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
may
then
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
you
say
you
think
that
that's
what
ought
to
be
done.
is
that
what
you
think
the
constitution
requires?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you're
asking
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
is
far-field
from
your
argument
at
all.
if
the
--
the
constitution
either
requires
a
jury
trial
or
it
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
we're
talking
about
what
ought
to
be
done
or
ought
not
to
be
done.
then,
we're
talking
about
questions
of
policy.
what
i'm
asking
you
is
about
--
is
a
question
of
what
the
constitution
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
must
be
done.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
suggesting
that
there
are
some
contempts
of
court
which
aren't
subject
to
the
jury
trial
provisions
of
the
constitution,
you
have
to
arrive
at
some
way
of
construing
those
out
of
the
words
of
the
constitution.
how
would
you
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
he
threw
inkwell
at
a
member
of
the
jury.
it
had
the
same
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
suggestion
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
suggestion
that
they
should
be
willing
to
abide
by
that
decision,
or
any
other,
only
if
the
reasoning
appeals
to
them?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
