mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
that
remain
for
argument,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
the
points
that
we
consider
to
be
controlling
of
the
answer
that's
to
be
given
to
the
one
question
that
was
certified
to
this
court.
i
went
on
september
10,
1962,
mr.
justice
black
vacated
the
several
stays
that
were
granted
by
judge
cameron
to
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
black
further
ordered,
in
very
plain
language,
that
the
judgment
and
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
shall
be
effective
immediately.
and
of
course,
there
was
added
also
that,
pending
final
action
by
this
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
respondents
be,
and
they
are
hereby,
enjoined
from
taking
any
steps
to
prevent
enforcement
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
judgment
and
mandate.
bearing
in
mind
now
that
there
was
this
order
that
the
judgment
and
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
shall
be
effective
immediately,
it
was
found
that
there
were
efforts
to
obstruct.
it
was
not
until
eight
days
later,
september
the
18th,
after
these
efforts
to
thwart
became
apparent
that
meredith's
enrolment
at
the
university
would
be
interfered
with
in
every
way
possible,
that
the
united
states
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
an
order
allowing
it
to
appear
in
the
case.
now,
this
was
the
act
of
a
government
that
was
deeply
concerned
about
the
preservation
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
upholding
of
the
integrity
and
authority
of
the
judicial
processes
of
the
united
states
courts.
the
court
of
appeals
entered
the
order,
allowing
the
united
states
to
appear
in
the
case.
and
while
the
court,
in
authorizing
the
united
states
to
appear,
did
designate
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae,
it
went
much
further.
the
designation
of
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
in
cases
similar
to
this
situation
had
occurred
in
both
the
fahlbusch
cases
and
the
bush
cases,
and
it
was
used
again
in
this
case.
but,
the
order
of
the
court
is
the
instrument
to
which
we
will
look
to
see
what
authority
the
united
states
was
given
to
appear
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
case.
in
every
respect,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
was
given
precisely
the
same
rights,
the
same
authority
that
any
party
to
a
suit
could
be
accorded.
it
was
authorized
to
enter
the
case
“with
the
right
to
submit
pleadings,
evidence,
arguments,
and
briefs
and
to
initiate
proceedings
for
injunctive
relief
and
proceedings
for
contempt
of
court.”
so,
in
a
real
sense,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
order
entered
and
here
involved
emanated
from
an
action
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
was
given
in
the
case
in
which
the
united
states
--
in
this
case
which
it
appeared
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
when
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
mr.
justice
black,
when
the
administration
of
justice
and
its
processes
are
at
stake,
as
was
true
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
has
been
done.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
say
that
it
has
been
done
in
other
cases,
of
course,
in
the
fahlbusch
and
bush
case.
but
the
precise
basis
for
its
being
done
is
because
the
court
is
powerless
unless
it
has
the
assistance
of
someone
else
to
help
it
enforce
its
orders.
mr.
leon
jaworski
those
are
the
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
they're
not
limited
in
any
way.
no,
sir,
except
that,
of
course,
we
do
have
a
statute
that
expressly
provides
that
where
the
united
states
is
a
party,
and
that's
where
the
right
emanates
from,
that
where
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
the
proceedings,
where
the
united
states
brings
the
action
and
prosecutes
it,
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
that
is
given
under
sections
402
and
3691
do
not
apply.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
think
that's
correct,
normally,
they
are
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
was
an
independent
restraining
order,
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
there
have
been
other
cases
in
which
it
has
been,
your
honor.
now,
if
you
--
if
you
ask
whether
there's
any
that
this
court
has
written
on
that
particular
subject,
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
particular
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
bush
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
certainly
did,
sir.
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
they
order
to
gave
at
the
authority
to
proceed
as
a
party
when
it
proceeded,
yes,
to
ask
for
injunctive
relief.
i
do
know
that
it
was
given
particular
right
to
so
appear.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
should
add
of
course
that,
in
both,
the
fahlbusch
case
as
well
as
the
bush
case,
this
court
refused
the
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
perhaps
the
word
“amicus
curiae”
was
not
the
choice
that's
almost
accurate
designation
to
use.
but,
are
we
going
to
disregard
what
the
court
actually
said
on
the
power
that
was
given
and
if
we
did,
of
course
we
would
be
substituting
a
form
for
substance.
mr.
leon
jaworski
not
as
well
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
record
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we
have
that
shows
the
matter
that
was
brought
into
issue
is
contained
in
what
the
court
--
the
four
members
of
the
court
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
four
contains
and
it
does
set
forth.
mr.
leon
jaworski
on
page
5,
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
it
has
said
that,
on
september
18,
1962,
this
court
judges
brown,
wisdom,
and
bell,
after
first
ascertaining
from
the
district
court
that
it
declined
to
enter
an
order
in
this
form,
entered
its
order
allowing
the
united
states
to
appear
in
the
case.
the
order
is
cited.
it
--
appearing
from
the
application,
united
states
filed
a
stay
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
to
the
due
administration
of
justice
and
integrity
of
the
processes
of
its
courts
should
be
presented
in
these
proceedings,
and
so
on.
and
then,
the
order
specifically
set
forth
what
i've
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
as
to
the
power
and
the
authority
that
was
given.
i
should
like,
because
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
is
sir,
yes.
and
i
should
also
say
that
in
the
question
certified
the
court
specifically
points
out
that
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
was
given
the
right
to
initiate
proceedings
for
injunctive
relief.
that
is
a
part
of
the
certified
question
that
is
here
submitted.
there
has
been,
from
the
time
that
this
court
first
commented
upon
the
question
of
contempt
trials
--
criminal
contempt
trials,
there
has
been
followed
the
belief
of
principle
that
there
was
an
inherent
in
the
court
the
right
to
vindicate
its
authority
to
enforce
its
orders,
to
protect
itself
from
insult,
as
one
of
the
cases
of
this
court
says,
without
the
necessity
of
calling
upon
a
jury
to
assist
in
the
exercise
of
its
power.
and
this
court
has
always
considered
that
the
exercise
of
such
a
power
was
necessary
so
that
the
lawful
judgments
of
the
court
maybe
respected
and
enforced.
it
has
pointedly
said
that,
to
compel
obedience
to
its
orders,
it
must
have
the
right
to
inquire
whether
there
has
been
disobedience
and
that
the
submission
of
the
question
to
a
jury
would
operate
to
deprive
the
proceeding
of
half
of
its
sufficiency,
as
it
was
said
in
the
debs
case.
mr.
leon
jaworski
under
the
criminal
contempt
proceedings?
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
jaworski
none,
whatever.
of
course
it
would
have
to
be
reasonable.
it
would
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
correct.
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
it
is
clear
from
a
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
leon
jaworski
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leon
jaworski
and
if
this
court
has
exercised
that
right
of
limitation.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
justice
warren,
i
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
very
much
appreciate
it
because
there's
one
thought
that
i
wanted
to
convey
to
the
court.
there
is
no
greater
menace,
no
greater
threat,
in
my
opinion,
to
the
proper
and
orderly
administration
of
justice
than
the
willful
disobedience
of
court
decrees.
isolated
but
notorious
instances
of
contempt
that
are
not
effectively
dealt
with,
with
every
possible
deterrent
being
used,
will
soon
multiply
to
common
place
occurrences
and
i
submit
that
our
system
of
justice
should
be
insulated,
as
was
done
in
the
green
case,
against
this
threat
by
retaining
the
effective
deterrent
that
the
green
case
pronounces.
now,
i
have
a
high
regard
for
the
trial
--
right
of
trial
by
jury,
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
the
court,
but
if
the
court
decrees
are
not
to
be
evade
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
would
give
it
in
every
kind
of
case,
except
in
the
cases
where
i
saw
that
the
very
administration
of
justice
will
be
completely
destroyed
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
unless
there
are
effective
means
found
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
is
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
black,
and
this
court
has
so
said
itself
in
the
green
case,
as
it
did
in
one
or
two
other
cases.
and
i
would
say,
again,
that
if
court
decrees
are
not
to
be
evade,
what
is
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
worth?
and
if
court
decrees
are
not
to
be
evade,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
is
the
constitution
worth?
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
wasn't
aware
of
it
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don't
think
it's
too
dangerous,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
just
think
that
there
is
needed
every
sort
of
insulation
and
every
sort
of
deterrent
against
the
violation
of
court
orders.
it
is
that
vital
to
the
administration
of
justice.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
