of
the
united

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
that
be
suggested
mr.
solicitor
general
that
this
order
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
actually
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
mean
they're
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
i'm
trouble
by
you
mr.
solicitor
(inaudible)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
contempt,
it's
described.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
clark,
under
your
statute,
1509,
is
it
your
contention
that
there
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
is
it
applicable
to
the
actual
situation
of
the
defendant?
it
would
be
punishable
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
it
be
punishable?
can
the
court
punish
the
statute
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
think
it
detracts
anything
from
your
reference,
but
i
think
that
has
been
quoted
quite
a
number
of
times.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
there
is
the
fact
that
there
had
been
the
summary
contempt
power
that
you
say
exist.
how
it
can
exist?
it
can
exist
by
necessity.
is
that
why
it
exists?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
by
necessity,
where
would
you
position
it
from
georgia?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that,
you
say
is
just
an
extension
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
exists.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
doesn't
the
court
adjust
this
issue?
i
think,
in
the
terry
case,
when
the
marshal
was
assaulted
and
the
circuit
court
sat
on
just
the
facts
before
it
said
(inaudible),
that's
obviously
a
criminal
sanction.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
found
it
difficult
that
your
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
questioning
that
that
is
the
issue,
whether
it's
in
the
record
right
now?
do
you
say
that
the
court
must
be
able
to,
certifying
the
question
in
this
court,
misstate
the
fact?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand.
that's
your
legal
concession
but
i
ask
you
whether
you're
questioning
the
accuracy
of
the
facts
you
have
stated.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
rest
of
the
validity
on
the
case
and
with
the
court
of
appeals
putting
aside
the
jury
question
for
both,
then,
imagine
bearing
the
involvement
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
then
permitted
a
third
party
to
come
in,
following
the
extension
in
your
present
proceedings
for
injunction
in
that
action.
unless
you
basically
filed
in
the
district
court
where
they
prosecuted
arrest?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
this
injunction
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
by
the
(inaudible)
was
their
intention
described
in
the
action
by
the
ancillary
to
(inaudible)
government
issued
on
the
day
they
got
an
injunction,
wasn't
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
you
submit
they
have
never
taken
the
rest
of
that
(inaudible)
in
this
type
of
procedure
and
kept
it
on
sanction?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
even
a
court
case
is
going
to
follow
bush
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
anything
in
your
argument
of
the
fifth
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
wasn't
then
that
had
subject
the
legislation
in
its
own
terms
here
and
the
government
asked
us
you
to
(inaudible).
