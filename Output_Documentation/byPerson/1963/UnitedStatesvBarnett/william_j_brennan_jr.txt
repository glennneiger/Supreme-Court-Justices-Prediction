justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
missed
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
for
what
reason
are
you
going
to
go
into
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
--
might
that
have
been
done
in
an
original
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tantamount
to
a
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
it
would
not
have
been
the
order
i
think
that
entered
in
the
district
court
after
mr.
justice
black's
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
excuse
me
mr.
solicitor,
this
is
an
order
of
the
25th
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
that
ever
followed
by
any
--
the
entry
for
any
order
in
like
terms
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
for
contempt
for
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
civil
contempt
proceedings,
were
on
the
order
entered
in
the
district
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
much
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
criminal
contempt
proceedings
are
simply
and
solely
on
this
order
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
gather
this
argument
you're
now
making
mr.
solicitor
is
on
the
premise
that
this
was
another
court
of
appeals
order
that
was
violated,
whether
district
court
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
by
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
judge
bell's
argument
in
his
opinion
mr.
solicitor
that
he
must
abide
the
statutes
acted,
where
the
district
court
only
act
as
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
that
judge
bell
proceeds
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
this
argument
that
is
that
whatever
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
as
it
did
earlier
on
the
25th,
it
did
act
and
entered
an
order
disobedience
of
which
then
its
representative
of
the
court
was
threatened
by
some
proposed
action
of
the
governor's
and
then
as
an
instance
to
that
order,
you
got
this
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
only
court
to
which
it
could
have
gone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
against
this
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
procedure
they
found
(inaudible)?
what's
the
procedure
they
found,
take
evidence
before
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
there
had
been
some
nlrb.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
to
suggest
that
there'd
be
no
power
in
the
court
of
appeals,
remit
to
--
the
court
of
appeals
behalf
the
trial
of
a
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
actually
42
(b)
consent
is
really
held
different
charges
or
rather
non-charges
before
different
judges,
aren't
they?
contempt
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
the
same
court
but
somehow
it's
surprising.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
seek
testing
the
case
is
moot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
from
judge
bell's
opinion
that
the
court
was
asked
to
certify
or
he's
discussed
whether
to
certify
it,
as
an
additional
question,
if
respondents
are
entitled
to
trial
by
jury
for
the
criminal
contempt
and
may
the
order
to
show
cause
charging
him
be
referred
to
the
district
court
where
the
alleged
acts
of
contempt
were
committed
to
trial
and
that
the
court,
as
a
court,
would
not
certify
that
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
question
we
have
is
whether
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
not
where,
if
you
are,
it's
to
be
held.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
what
you
mean
but,
from
the
standpoint
of
what
we
are
to
do,
when
we
agree
with
you
that
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
are
we
to
go
on
then
to
say
where
the
trial
is
to
be
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
the
amount
of
punishment
is
certainly
subject
to
review
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we've
done
it
several
times.
