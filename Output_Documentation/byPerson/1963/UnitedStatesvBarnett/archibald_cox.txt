mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certificate
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
i
shall
present
the
opening
argument
on
behalf
of
the
untied
states
and
mr.
leon
jaworski,
who
was
the
counsel
in
the
court
below
by
special
appointment,
will
make
any
rebuttal.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
defendants
were
charged
with
criminal
contempt
of
court
or
intentional
violation
of
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
are
entitled
to
trial
by
jury.
defendants
claim
a
jury
on
two
grounds.
by
statute,
under
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
code
that
provides
for
the
trial
of
certain
contempt
charges
by
jury
when
the
contemptuous
acts
are
also
crimes,
and
second
by
the
constitution.
our
answer
to
the
statutory
claim
will
be
that
it
is
effective
for
two
independently
sufficient
reasons
because
the
statute
by
its
terms
is
applicable
only
to
contempt
to
an
order
of
a
district
court
and
this
was
an
order
of
a
court
of
appeals,
and
second
because
the
statute
expressly
accepts
charges
of
violation
of
an
order
entered
in
an
action
maintained
by
the
united
states,
and
this
in
our
view
was
such
an
action.
our
answer
to
the
constitutional
claim
is
that
the
trial
of
contempt
charges
by
the
court
for
the
charges
violation
of
the
court's
order
addressed
to
the
--
to
a
party,
has
been
in
the
established
part
of
our
constitutional
law
since
the
founding
of
republic.
the
legal
issues
arise
because
the
governor,
the
lieutenant
governor
of
the
state
sought
to
arise
--
to
have
array
the
whole
colloquy
of
the
state
against
a
final
adjudication
by
the
federal
court.
the
contempt
with
which
they
are
charged
caused
rioting,
loss
of
life
and
the
need
for
federal
troops
to
uphold
the
law
of
the
land
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
mississippi.
we're
not
concerned
here
with
the
details
of
those
tragic
events,
but
a
careful
understanding
of
the
incidents
leading
up
to
the
entry
of
the
order
in
precedent
and
to
its
violation
is
essential
to
understand
both
how
the
united
states
came
to
seek
this
order
and
also
why
it
was
entered
by
a
court
of
appeals
rather
than
a
district
court.
for
that
reason,
i
want
to
take
some
little
time
carefully
to
state
the
sequence
of
events
leading
up
to
the
order.
in
january,
1961,
james
meredith
applied
--
mr.
archibald
cox
because
i
think
i'm
concentrating
on
the
facts
insofar
as
they
show
first,
how
it
came
to
be
that
the
united
states
sought
this
order
for
violation
of
which
united
--
barnett
is
charged
with
contempt
and
second,
how
the
order
it
came
to
be
made
by
a
court
of
appeals
rather
than
by
a
district
court.
i
think
that
both
of
those
becoming
important
in
the
discussion
of
the
legal
argument,
but
i
shall
try
to
confine
myself
to
the
facts
so
far
as
a
deal
with
that
did
not
go
into
the
extraneous
events.
in
january,
1961,
as
i
have
said,
james
meredith
applied
for
admission
to
the
university
of
mississippi
at
a
term
beginning
in
february.
in
may,
after
a
long
delay
in
getting
any
answer
from
the
university
and
a
final
rejection,
he
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
he
was
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination.
the
case
then
wound
its
way
through
the
courts
including
a
four-month
delay
by
the
district
court
in
acting
upon
a
motion
for
interlocutory
relief,
preliminary
relief
after
the
hearing
on
that
motion
had
been
completed.
on
june
25th,
1962,
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
an
opinion,
finding
that
meredith
had
been
the
victim
of
racial
discrimination
and
directing
the
entry
of
an
injunction
requiring
the
university
officials
to
admit
meredith.
the
mandate
issued
in
due
course
on
the
17th
of
july.
on
july
18,
circuit
judge
cameron,
who
had
not
been
a
member
of
the
panel,
issued
a
stay
of
the
mandate
that
had
already
in
fact
gone
down.
the
panel
of
the
three
judges
who
had
heard
the
case
then
invited
briefs
from
the
parties
on
the
question
of
the
stay
and
later
filed
on
july
27
an
opinion
vacating
the
order
of
judge
cameron.
the
panel
also
recalled
the
mandate
and
amended
it
to
set
forth
specifically
the
exact
terms
of
the
injunction
to
be
entered
by
the
district
court
requiring
meredith's
admission
to
the
university.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
own
injunction
requiring
the
trustees
and
university
officials
to
admit
meredith
and
to
refrain
from
discrimination
and
respect
to
his
continued
dependence.
twice
more
than
judge
cameron
issued
a
stay
and
as
many
times,
they
were
vacated
by
the
panel,
but
he
issued
a
third
stay.
the
private
plaintiff
brought
the
case
here.
justice
black
vacated
all
the
stays
and
on
september
13,
1962,
the
district
court
finally
entered
an
injunction
in
accordance
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
full
term
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
in
--
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
injunction
in
addition
to
vacating
the
stay,
good
as
i
recall
up
until
the
district
court
had
entered
the
mandate.
i
don't
think
it's
purported
to
go
beyond
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
not,
not
only
for
that
reason
but
probably
also
because
justice
black's
injunction
was
limited
to
persons
acting
in
active
concert
with
the
named
defendants
and
at
least,
the
contempt
--
contemptuous
act
charged
in
the
eventual
citation
here
were
actually
could
not
be
said
to
be
an
act
of
concert
or
participation
with
the
university
trustees.
indeed,
they
were
designed
to
support
the
university
trustees
from
doing
what
they
had
agreed
to
do
when
the
question
was
brought
(inaudible).
so,
i
think
we
would
have
a
very
hard
time
for
both
reasons.
i
mentioned
and
wish
to
emphasize
it
because
events
began
to
move
very
fast
at
this
point
that
the
full
term
of
the
university
was
to
begin
on
september
20.
and
since
meredith
was
a
transfer
student,
that
not
--
not
only
was
the
first
day
on
which
he
might
register
but
it
was
the
proper
day
for
him
to
register
at
the
university
and
begin
attending
classes
a
little
later.
on
september
16th,
governor
barnett
moved
to
block
meredith's
enrollment
by
issuing
a
proclamation
of
interposition
characterizing
the
decree
of
the
federal
court
as
a
direct
usurpation
of
power
by
the
federal
government
and
directing
all
state
officials
to
disregard
it.
let
me
emphasize
that
this
in
all
subsequent
acts
of
governor
barnett
were
not
simply
defiance
by
a
single
individual.
it
was
action
by
the
governor
of
a
state
seeking
to
nullify
the
injunction
by
arraying
against
the
full
power
of
the
state.
the
public
officials
and
the
police
as
well
as
all
the
members
of
the
party
list
that
he
could
arise.
what
had
been
a
private
lawsuit
up
to
that
point
was
thus
converted
into
a
deliberate
challenge
to
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
the
adjudicatory
powers
of
the
federal
court.
accordingly,
on
the
18th
of
september,
the
united
states
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
an
order
permitting
henceforth
to
participate
in
all
proceedings
in
either
the
district
or
the
circuit
court.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
act
until
it
ascertained
from
the
district
judge
but
the
district
judge
would
not
enter
the
order
requested
by
the
united
states.
the
appellate
court
then
entered
an
order
permitting
the
united
states
to
participate
as
it
requested
in
either
court
and
gave
it
the
right
to
initiate
further
proceedings,
including
proceedings
through
injunctive
relief
such
as
might
be
appropriate
in
order
to
preserve
the
due
administration
of
justice
and
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
processes
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
it
spoke
of
being
admitted
as
amicus
curiae,
but
it
also
stated
expressly
what
it
wished
to
be
given
permission
to
do.
and
the
permission
was
not
only
to
file
briefs
and
to
prevent
argument,
but
to
initiate
such
further
proceeding,
including
proceedings
for
injunctive
relief
and
including
proceedings
in
contempt
as
it
might
be
necessary
to
uphold
the
integrity
of
the
law.
we
take
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
it
might.
we
think
this
was
an
independent
ancillary
action
--
mr.
archibald
cox
tantamount
to
a
proceeding
initiated
by
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
label
as
amicus
curiae
was
there
but
the
order
--
perhaps
i
make
it
clear.
the
order
contains
these
operative
parts
and
i
would
think
the
operative
parts
spoke
more
effectively
than
any
label
that
was
put
on
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
of
--
not
of
an
original
action.
no,
i
was
thinking
more
of
a
character
and
proceeding
in
the
manner
of
jurisdiction.
it
had
an
ancillary
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
might
also
had
an
original
jurisdiction
--
had
a
jurisdiction
even
though
not
ancillary
in
this
sense,
justice
goldberg.
it
consulted
with
the
district
court.
the
district
court
had
made
it
plain
that
it
would
not
grant
the
relief.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
was
exercising
reviewing,
a
revisory
jurisdiction,
not
by
direct
appeal,
but
under
the
oral
writ
statute
which
of
course
has
done
in
many
cases
where
there
is
urgency,
but
if
it
was
original,
it
would
of
course
have
to
have
been
first
in
the
district
court.
on
september
19,
after
the
government
obtain
--
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
that
time.
the
governor
at
that
time
had
not
been
brought
in
as
a
party.
he
was
not
brought
in
as
a
party
until
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
early
--
on
the
24th
and
25th.
this
in
effect
simply
set
the
stage
for
the
united
states
to
come
and
apply
for
such
orders
as
it
might
be
necessary
to
deal
with
this
challenge
to
the
authority
of
its
courts.
on
september
19,
that's
one
day
before
barnett
was
due
to
register
at
the
university,
a
state
court
issued
an
injunction
directing
meredith
not
to
enter
and
requiring
the
university
officials
not
to
register
and
enjoining
numerous
federal
officials
including
those
in
the
department
of
justice
and
the
united
states
marshals
from
doing
anything
intended
to
enrolling
at
the
university
as
a
student
pursuant
to
the
decrees
of
the
court.
the
federal
officials
then
removed
that
case
in
the
district
court
and
asked
the
district
court
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
also,
meredith
as
i
have
said
was
scheduled
to
enroll
at
the
university
the
next
day
on
the
20th,
the
district
court
denied
--
refused
to
act
promptly
on
the
motion
and
set
it
down
for
a
hearing
on
september
24th
after
at
least
three
in
most
of
the
fourth
day,
possible
day
for
enrolment
had
expired
--
had
passed.
on
the
20th,
in
the
morning,
the
united
states
also
applied
to
the
district
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
prohibiting
meredith's
arrest
for
a
local
offense
and
rejoining
the
implementation
of
a
state
statute
just
passed
which
made
it
a
state
crime
for
anyone
to
enroll
meredith
or
to
attempt
to
enroll
him
pursuant
to
the
decree.
the
united
states
sought
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
that
statute.
the
district
court
enjoined
meredith's
arrest,
but
it
again
declined
the
further
relief
that
was
necessary
to
implement
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there'd
be
no
discrimination
in
the
enrolment
of
meredith
which
was
to
take
place
on
september
20.
again,
it
set
the
hearing
for
september
24th
after
their
mandate
would
have
been
forwarded
for
at
least
three
days.
later
on
september
20th,
the
united
states
applied
for
the
necessary
orders
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that
court,
as
it
states
in
its
certificate,
required
government
counsel
to
offer
the
district
court
a
second
opportunity
to
take
steps
to
implement
mandate,
the
earlier
decree.
but
when
the
district
court
again
refused
to
act,
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
own
temporary
restraining
order
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
state
statute
and
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
state
court
decree.
still
on
september
20th,
meredith
attempted
to
register
at
the
university
and
then
he
was
rebuffed
by
governor
barnett
from
the
trustees
who
named
as
registrant.
the
united
states
then
moved
to
the
district
court
to
cite
certain
administrative
officials
of
the
university
with
chancellor,
the
dean,
the
registrar
in
civil
contempt.
the
hearing
was
held
on
september
21st
and
on
that
day,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
citation.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
have
been
based
on
the
original
decree
of
the
district
court
if
my
memory
is
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
that
proceeding
was
in
the
district
court.
the
proceeding
i
just
mentioned
was
in
the
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the
citation.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
merits,
yes.
yes.
now,
we
did
also
apply
on
september
21st
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
an
order
requiring
the
board
of
trustees
to
show
cause
by
its
members
should
not
be
held
in
civil
contempt.
after
the
district
court
had
denied
relief
in
the
proceeding
against
the
administrative
officials,
the
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
broadened
to
include
the
administrative
officials.
at
the
hearing
on
that
application,
on
september
24th,
the
board
of
trustees
and
the
registrar
now
being
squarely
faced
with
an
adjudication
of
the
court
of
appeals,
directed
to
them
indicated
that
they
were
ready
to
comply
with
the
court
decrees.
and
the
registrar
announced
that
he
would
be
available
in
jackson,
mississippi
at
1
p.m.
on
the
25th
of
september,
that
would
be
the
next
day,
to
register
meredith.
on
that
same
day,
the
25th
--
excuse
me,
the
24th,
the
arrangement
proposed
by
the
trustees
was
embodied
in
a
specific
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
requiring
the
registrar
and
the
trustees
to
register
meredith
the
next
day
at
1
o'clock.
that
same
evening,
after
learning
that
governor
barnett
had
again
declared
his
intention
to
prevent
meredith's
registration,
the
united
states
applied
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
had
been
proceeding
with
the
cause
that
very
afternoon
for
a
temporary
order
restraining
governor
barnett,
his
agents,
and
employees,
and
so
forth
from
obstructing
meredith's
enrolment
and
his
continued
attendance
at
the
university.
it's
for
the
alleged
violations
of
that
order
of
september
25th,
directed
specifically
to
governor
barnett
that
the
defendants
were
later
charged
with
criminal
contempt.
on
september
25th,
barnett,
after
service
of
the
order
physically
barred
meredith
from
restraining
at
the
jackson
office
of
the
university.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
that
was
the
only
order
ever
directed
expressly
to
governor
barnett
and
it
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
on
that
very
afternoon,
had
been
--
had
the
cause
before
it,
and
which
had
arranged
for
the
registration
of
meredith
in
a
specific
order
entered
that
afternoon
--
the
afternoon
before,
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
united
states
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
violation
of
that
order
that
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
this
order,
which
is
i
emphasize
the
only
order
ever
addressed
to
barnett
except
for
subsequent
one
making
that
same
more
to
more
permanent.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
rule
65,
those
are
limited
to
persons
acting
in
active
concert
or
participation
and
as
i
have
suggested
a
moment
ago,
you
see
here
the
named
defendants
were
read.
they
had
been
faced
with
the
questions
squarely
and
they
had
yet
said,
'"yes,
we
will
comply
with
the
law
of
the
land."
and
then
governor
barnett
came
and
prevented
them
according
to
the
allegations
from
doing
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
under
the
decree
and
we
would
surely
have
a
very
difficult
time
under
those
circumstances
in
ordering
that
he
was
an
hater
or
(inaudible).
rule
65
was
intended
to
cut
down
the
sweeping
decrees
that
used
to
be
issued
as
both
your
honor
and
i
know
well,
it
lubricates
the
likelihood.
it
was
intended
to
limit
and
it
requires
of
participation
with
the
named
defendants.
on
the
25th,
as
i
have
said,
barnett
physically
barred
meredith
from
registering
with
notice
of
the
order
and
the
next
day,
lieutenant
--
lieutenant
governor
johnson
did
the
same
thing.
those
two
acts
on
the
25th
and
26th,
formed
the
basis
of
the
first
specific
charge
of
criminal
contempt
against
these
two
defendants.
on
the
27th,
meredith
started
for
the
campus,
but
was
turned
back
because
according
to
the
subsequent
charges,
barnett
and
johnson
willfully
failed
to
take
measures
necessary
to
preserve
law
and
order
at
the
university
and
instead,
encouraged
the
state
highway
patrol
and
various
deputy
sheriffs
--
sheriff
to
prevent
meredith's
entry.
now,
the
incidence
of
that
day
formed
the
basis
of
the
second
specific
charge
of
criminal
contempt.
on
the
28th
and
29th
of
september,
barnett
and
johnson
were
found
in
civil
contempt
and
ordered
to
stand
committed
and
to
pay
fines.
and
less
before
october
2nd,
that
would
be
the
following
wednesday,
they
showed
that
they
were
in
full
compliance
with
the
court's
decree
and
intended
to
comply
in
the
future.
on
sunday,
september
30,
after
the
civil
contempt
procedure,
meredith
entered
the
campus
in
one
of
the
buildings
by
arrangement
of
the
governor.
as
it's
well-known,
a
large
crowd
gathered
and
rioting
began.
the
state
highway
patrol
and
the
large
number
of
sheriffs,
deputy
sheriffs
were
present
but
they
failed
to
act.
it
was
violence
upon
a
tragic
scale.
the
president
of
the
united
states
then
dispatched
military
personnel
to
oxford
to
restore
order.
the
third
specification
is
that
barnett
knowing
that
the
failure
of
the
state
highway
patrol
to
maintain
peace
and
order
under
campus
on
that
day
would
result
an
obstruction
of
the
injunction
nevertheless,
in
violation
of
his
obligation
under
the
order
of
september
25th,
willfully
failed
to
exercise
his
authority
to
maintain
law
and
order.
two
later
incidents
should
be
mentioned.
on
october
2nd,
barnett's
attorneys
appeared
back
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
stated
that
the
governor
was
in
full
compliance
with
the
order
of
september
25th
and
intent
would
comply
in
the
future
to
the
extent
of
his
ability.
on
october
17th
--
october
12th,
counsel
retracted
the
statement
that
barnett
intended
to
comply
with
the
orders
of
the
court.
a
week
later,
they
asserted
that
the
governor
reserved
the
right
to
determine
whether
compliance
with
the
orders
was
consistent
with
his
position
is
governor
of
mississippi.
and
on
the
same
day,
the
court,
all
seven
judges
sitting
unanimously
denied
motions
to
resolve
--
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order.
with
barnett
and
johnson,
refusing
to
give
assurances
of
compliance,
the
court
of
appeals
instructed
the
attorney
general
to
institute
proceedings
for
criminal
contempt.
on
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
suffices
for
present
purposes
since
the
case
is
here
on
certificate
to
say
that
the
defendants
did
properly
raise
the
claim
of
a
jury
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
heard
the
argument
en
banc.
the
judges
being
evenly
divided
on
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial,
they
certified
the
question
to
this
court.
the
first
question
then
is
whether
the
governing
statutes
provide
for
trial
by
jury
or
trial
by
the
court.
18
u.s.c.
section
402,
which
is
printed
on
page
58
of
the
government's
brief
provides,
i'll
skip
the
unimportant
words,
any
person
willfully
disobeying
any
lawful
writ,
etcetera,
decree
or
command
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states,
or
any
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
by
doing
any
act
or
thing,
therein
or
thereby
forbidden.
if
the
act
or
thing
so
done,
it
will
be
such
a
character
as
to
constitute
a
criminal
offense
shall
be
prosecuted
for
such
contempt
as
provided
in
section
3691
of
this
act.
the
next
paragraph
makes
an
exception
for
any
suit
or
action
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
accepted
cases
and
all
other
cases
of
contempt
not
specifically
embraced
in
this
section,
shall
be
punished
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
usages
at
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
became
crimes
under
a
--
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960
i
think
it
was.
following
the
events
in
the
casper
case
in
tennessee
and
the
events
at
little
rock,
a
statute
was
enacted
making
obstruction
on
the
decrees
as
federal
court's
crime.
mr.
archibald
cox
there'd
be
no
possible
right
under
the
statute
and
while
we
don't
make
anything
as
prior
to
your
honor
so
we're
glad
too.
it
is
--
this
of
course
was
quietly
reverse
of
what
the
clayton
act
was
directed
at.
but
the
clayton
act
was
directed
to
dissolve
some
batteries,
fights
on
the
picket
line,
trustees
of
the
property,
or
things
normally
doubt
with
the
breaches
of
peace
of
which
the
sweeping
labor
injunctions
ran
against
and
which
were
then
privately
prosecuted
without
a
jury.
here,
the
just
of
the
offense
is
the
challenge
to
the
adjudicatory
powers
of
the
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
--
we
have
--
i
don't
display
how
many
help
i
can
get
but
we
don't
predicate
in
the
argument
on
that.
we
have
assumed
that
so
far
as
that
goes,
they
have
been
made
crimes
and
that
therefore
so
far
as
that
point
goes,
sections
21
and
22
of
the
clayton
act
would
be
applicable
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i'm
just
about
to
submit
that
this
case
is
not
covered
by
section
402,
first,
because
section
402
applies
only
to
charges
of
contempt
to
a
decree
of
a
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
by
one
sentence
with
that
commission.
the
words
of
the
statute
that
speak
only
of
any
person
disobeying
any
decree
or
command
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
or
any
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
section
3691
to
which
section
402
refers
you,
provides
whenever
a
contempt
charge
will
consist
of
willful
disobedience
of
any
lawfully
writ
and
so
forth,
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states.
now,
there's
no
possibility
that
the
use
of
the
words
district
court
resulted
from
some
inadvertence
or
mistake
of
the
compilers.
sections
21
and
22
of
the
clayton
act
from
which
they
were
derived
also
speak
of
the
--
of
the
same
words
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
in
both
sections.
now
furthermore,
in
section
20
of
the
clayton
act,
which
deals
with
certain
acts
that
may
not
be
enjoined
by
federal
courts,
the
term
used
is
any
court
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
contrast
again
emphasizes
that
it
was
not
inadvertent.
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
in
few
of
the
words,
the
legislative
history
would
dispel
it
represented
in
clayton.
let
me
backup
one
step.
the
early
bills
proposed
by
representative
clayton
and
this
all
began
with
the
1896
presidential
campaign
applied
to
all
courts
of
the
united
states
except
the
supreme
court.
then,
at
the
first
congress
to
pass
in
1912,
the
bill
recommended
by
the
judiciary
committee
was
limited
to
the
district
court.
now,
representative
clayton
explained
this
on
the
floor.
he
spoke
of
the
criticisms
of
his
earlier
bill
and
showed
how
they've
been
meant.
he
said
the
next
criticism
was
that
it
provided
for
contempt
in
courts
where
there
were
no
jurors.
we
answered
that
by
confining
the
operation
of
this
bill
to
the
circuit
courts.
he
obviously
meant
the
old
circuit
courts
which
issued
many
labor
injunctions.
and
we
exempt
its
operation
in
the
courts
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
there
were
similar
statements
by
other
members
of
the
judiciary
committee.
in
1912,
the
clayton
contempt
bill
passed
the
house
representatives
but
it
was
defeated
by
the
senate.
after
the
new
administration
took
over,
however,
the
provisions
were
included
in
the
broader
clayton
bill
that
we
now
know
as
the
clayton
antitrust
act
and
were
enacted
into
law.
the
committee
reports
at
that
time
expressly
refer
back
to
the
1912
bill
and
indeed
they
even
incorporate
the
1912
bill,
the
reports
on
the
1912
bill
by
reference
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
taken
with
that
history
in
the
direct
line
of
dissent.
respondent's
chief
argument,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
inclusion
of
the
words
any
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
somehow
show
that
the
words
district
court
be
in
court
of
appeals.
now
the
argument
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
phrase
any
court
from
the
district
of
columbia
includes
what
is
now
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
that
to
deny
litigants
before
other
courts
of
appeals,
the
jury
trial
required
in
that
court
would
deny
citizens
of
other
states
the
privileges
available
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
if
that
would
violate
article
3
section
2
of
the
constitution
which
guarantees
the
citizens
of
each
state,
all
the
privileges
and
the
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states.
the
obvious
defect
is
that
article
3
section
2
does
not
apply
to
congressional
action.
second
defect
is
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
probably
not
a
state
for
the
purposes
of
article
3
section
2.
third,
it
is
rather
unlikely
that
the
term
any
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
was
meant
to
include
more
than
the
nisi
prius
courts
which
were
not
then
known
as
federal
district
court
but
as
municipal
courts
and
as
the
supreme
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
well
i
suppose
it
does.
i
would
think
it
would
but
i
don't
think
the
tail
could
wag
the
dog.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
that
court
of
appeals
is
included
is
evidence
of
the
word
district
court
includes
other
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
--
first,
i
would
suggest
that
there's
nothing
in
the
concept
of
equal
protection
as
read
into
the
fifth
amendment
that
requires
identical
procedures,
judicial
procedures
in
the
other
federal
districts
and
circuits
to
those
required
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
was
trying
to
suggest
in
addition,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
if
there
is
any
constitutional
problem,
i
think
there's
none,
but
if
there
is
any
constitutional
problem,
then
--
and
the
circuit
court
was
faced
with
choosing
between
whether
the
words
district
court
mean
circuit
court
and
choosing
whether
the
term
any
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
includes
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
it
might
well
say
"no,
that
usage
is
broader
than
what
was
required"
and
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
in
that
manner
because
the
legislative
history
is
so
(inaudible)
that
congress
intended
this
requirement
to
apply
to
courts
where
there
are
jurors.
this
was
said
over
and
over
again.
it
was
said
after
this
language
was
put
in
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
as
well
as
before.
so
i
don't
think
it
has
--
it
has
to
be
decided
here
because
there's
nothing
to
the
argument
on
the
constitution.
i
simply
say
if
i'm
wrong
as
to
that,
that
there
are
two
ways
out
and
i
think
that
every
indication
would
be
that
the
district
court
means
district
court
and
that
the
general
term
was
perhaps
a
little
broader
and
intended,
but
i
don't
think
that
needs
to
be
resolved
now.defendants
also
argue
that
even
if
sections
402
and
3691
are
not
ordinarily
applicable
to
violations
of
an
order
of
an
appellate
court,
they
apply
here
because
the
government
could
have
chosen
to
prosecute
barnett
and
johnson
in
the
district
court.
i've
already
indicated
that
the
government
had
no
choice
in
this
matter.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
the
attorney
general
to
institute
prosecution.
now,
this
was
not
something
initiated
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
second
place,
the
courts
really
had
no
choice.
the
order
which
barnett
and
johnson
are
charged
with
violating
was
literally
and
substantially
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
the
only
order
specifically
addressed
to
barnett
personally.
it
was
the
only
order
that
he
clearly
disobeyed
whereas
i've
said
the
other
injunctions
were
not
addressed
to
him
and
were
limited
under
rule
65
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
seems
to
be
that
court
of
appeals
was
not
acting
as
a
district
court.
this
is
somewhat
along
the
same
line
as
the
intimations
in
the
opinions
below
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
not
to
have
entered
this
argument,
that
it
somehow
was
improper
and
should
have
left
the
matter
to
the
district
court.
it's
not
--
i
think
to
say,
that
the
order
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
i've
--
just
one
--
one
more
sentence.
there's
nothing
in
the
certified
question
the
challenges,
the
propriety
of
that
order
and
i
think
also
so
far
as
the
propriety
of
entering
that
order
goes,
if
the
question
was
brought
--
that
was
unanimously
settled
by
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
they
refused
to
dissolve
it
and
of
course,
it
was
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
this
court
denied.
now,
that's
a
part
of
my
answer
was
--
is
that
the
order
was
properly
made
by
the
court
as
a
court
of
appeals.
the
other
part
of
my
answer
of
course,
is
that
this
was
the
only
order
addressed
to
barnett.
now,
i
go
beyond
that.
i
don't
wish
to
stay
on
simply
having
this
adjudicated
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
with
eminent
propriety.
the
court
of
appeals
which
settled
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
ancillary
proceeding,
bringing
in
new
parties
in
order
to
protect
and
effectuate
its
mandate.
here,
i
think
he
could
have
acted
in
the
first
instance
as
was
done
in
(inaudible)
case
years
ago.
even
so,
at
every
possible
stage,
almost
up
to
the
very
end,
the
court
below
did
differ
to
the
district
court,
gave
it
an
opportunity
to
do
these
things.
it
acted
only
when
that
part
either
couldn't
do
anything
as
during
the
time
of
judge
cameron
stayed
when
there's
a
practical
manner
the
district
court
couldn't
be
expected
to
act
or
after
the
district
court
had
been
given
an
opportunity
and
declined
to
act.
that
was
true
not
only
because
it
couldn't
act
at
the
time
of
judge
cameron's
stay.
it
was
true
when
the
united
states
applied
it
for
the
order
of
amicus
curiae
when
judge
brown
called
the
district
judge.
it
was
true
and
we
sought
the
stays
against
enforcement
of
the
state
statute
and
against
enforcement
of
the
state
decree
and
the
court
below
declined
to
act
promptly.
it
was
partly
true
with
respect
to
the
proceedings
for
civil
contempt
but
not
entirely.
that
was
the
course
of
the
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
emphasize
again
that
the
university
officials
agreed
to
register
meredith
on
september
25th.
it
was
after
that
that
the
united
states
learned
that
governor
barnett
apparently
intended
to
block
the
effectuation
of
that
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
very
afternoon.
now
surely
at
that
stage,
it
was
proper
to
go
to
the
court
which
at
that
time
had
the
cause
before
it
and
to
seek
this
incidental
supplementary
relief
directed
to
governor
barnett
forbidding
him
to
frustrate
its
article.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
that
stage
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
it
was
the
proper
court
ability.
i
would
like
and
i
would
also
emphasize
since
you
go
back
over
the
events,
as
i
tried
to
state
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
stage
was
apparently
the
only
court
ready
to
act
promptly
in
a
manner
in
which
its
mandate
had
already
been
frustrated
for
four
critical
days.
mr.
archibald
cox
meredith
went
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
sought
a
supplementary
injunction
on
september
25th,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
--
not
exactly.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
--
it
was
directed
at
much
of
the
same
party,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
no.
there's
no
question.
and
that
was
made
very
clear
during
the
presentation
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
argument
of
this
point.
there
had
been
some
discussions.
no,
we
have
proceedings
for
contempt
of
our
arguments
if
i
may
put
it
colloquy
and
that
brings
me
of
course
to
a
point
which
i
must
cover
very
briefly.
the
second
reason
that
we
urge
that
the
defendants
are
not
entitled
to
a
jury
under
the
statute
is
that
the
only
section
has
barred
too
and
3691
carefully
accept
contempts
committed
in
disobedience
of
any
lawful
writ
entered
in
any
suit
or
action,
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
the
order
of
september
25th
that
the
defendants
violated,
was
entered
we
submit
in
a
suit
or
action
brought
and
prosecuted
by
the
united
states.
let
me
emphasize
first
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
then
come
back
to
the
statute.
the
united
states
obtained
the
order
in
prosecuting
its
own
independent
sovereign
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
processes
of
constitutional
adjudication.
until
mid-september,
the
case
of
meredith
against
fair
was
a
private
actual
order
to
enforce
what
meredith
said
for
his
constitutional
right.
united
states
didn't
participate.
we
had
no
statutory
authority
to
participate.
when
barnett
issued
his
proclamation
challenging
the
adjudicatory
powers
of
the
federal
court
and
arrayed
against
them,
everything
he
could
in
the
state
of
mississippi
then
the
entire
process
of
the
constitutional
adjudication
was
assaulted
and
the
power
of
the
law
was
attempting
to
be
settled
in
law.
the
interest
that
we
were
asserting
was
the
interest,
the
public
interest,
the
sovereign
interest
in
the
advocacy
of
court
decree,
in
the
rule
of
the
law
if
you
will
and
the
power
of
federal
courts
to
adjudicate
constitutional
issues
had
not
simply
meredith's
private
interest.
now,
our
position
before
the
court
as
i
said
before
we
think
is
determined
by
the
operative
provisions
of
the
order
and
that
arguments
based
on
the
label
of
amicus
curiae
are
wholly
beside
the
point.
similarly,
we
think
the
debates
on
civil
rights
legislation
of
1957
are
wholly
beside
the
point.
those
debates
were
concerned
with
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
sue
to
enforce
a
private
citizen's
constitutional
right,
the
kind
of
right
that
meredith
was
enforcing
that
he
initially
brought
this
action,
but
that
was
no
longer
the
issue.
that
right
had
been
finally
and
conclusively
adjudicated
that
the
issue
that
arose
where
the
united
states
intervened
was
the
question
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
court's
adjudications
and
it
was
that
that
was
challenged.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
were
not
labeled
intervener.
i
didn't
mean
it
in
any
technical
sense.
whether
we
were
not
in
substance
of
intervener
might
be
debated,
but
certainly
we
were
not
labeled
intervener
and
i
didn't
mean
to
--
we
participated.
we
were
given
the
right
to
institute
proceedings
what
we
instituted
we
think,
it
could
be
properly
labeled
a
supplementary
ancillary
--
an
independent
ancillary
action,
independent
in
the
sense
that
it
was
our
action,
ancillary
in
the
sense
that
it
was
ancillary
to
the
proceeding
then
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
previously
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
it
was
described
as
an
ancillary
action
by
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
and
the
declining
to
dissolve
the
order
against
barnett
when
that
question
arose
later
in
october.
but
even
if
there
were
doubt
about
the
technical
nomenclature,
the
very
words
of
the
statute
make
it
plain
that
the
exceptions
concerned
with
substance,
i
submit,
rather
than
form.
and
certainly
this
order
was
in
substance
entered
at
the
suit
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
has
very
broad
term
which
is
any
suit
or
action
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
but
the
sense
as
explained
in
both
the
house
of
the
senate
was
that
when
the
government
goes
to
court
to
enforce
a
public
right,
the
statutory
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
is
inapplicable.
i've
quoted
from
the
debates
in
my
brief.
there's
no
need
to
take
the
court's
time
to
read
them
here.
they
do
state
that
it
was
intended
to
leave
the
united
states
with
every
power
to
enforce
its
judgments
and
demands
that
it
has
not
that
is
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
so,
that
we
think
on
both
--
either
ground,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i
turn
now
to
the
defendant's
claim
that
regardless
of
the
statutes,
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
on
the
charge
of
willful
defiance
of
the
order
and
decree
of
an
appellate
court.
our
first
answer
is
this
--
it's
except
by
--
except
as
change
by
statute,
trial
by
the
court
against
the
party
for
violation
of
a
decree
directed
to
it
has
been
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
law
throughout
the
life
of
the
republic.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
can
be
said
to
be
law
in
the
sense
that
it
binds
the
court
as
well
as
the
litigants
is
the
constitutional
power
to
punish
a
party
for
contempt
of
a
decree
directed
to
him
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury.
that
principle,
as
the
court
will
recall,
is
expressed
in
an
unbroken
line
of
precedent
in
this
court.
it
was
specifically
adjudicated
as
recently
as
green
against
the
united
states
where
the
court
held
after
full
consideration
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
trial
by
jury
for
criminal
contempt.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
assume
that
when
the
court
--
i
assume
that
when
the
court
spoke
of
the
incidence
of
a
criminal
prosecution
that
it
was
speaking
generally
without
attempting
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
simply
say
that
that
was
not
an
instance
of
defiance
of
an
order
of
a
court
which
has
historically
and
for
very
good
reason,
i
should
submit
in
the
moment
be
regarded
as
a
separate
and
distinct
thing.
i
can't
--
with
all
respect,
i
can't'
believe
that
either
the
court
or
your
honor
intended
to
overrule
the
case
in
that
language.
but
of
course,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
i
emphasize
again.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
well,
i
would
say
that
the
court
was
not
there
concerned
where
a
party
is
not
only
violating
a
decree
of
a
court
addressed
to
him
which
constitutes
contempt,
which
is
always
from
a
special
branch
of
the
law
and
then
i
can't
believe
that
it
was
addressing
itself
to
that.
now,
i
shall
go
on
in
view
of
one
comment
your
honor,
you
may.
i
had
to
point
out
that
here
we
were
far
less
concerned
with
punishment
than
with
future
compliance.
i'd
like
to
defer
for
just
a
moment
my
remarks
on
that
point
but
i
intend
to
direct
myself
to
it
specifically.
i
was
seeking
to
emphasize
the
extent
to
which
this
rule
has
been
part
of
the
fabric
of
our
law.
i
mentioned
the
decisions
in
this
court
and
i
think
it
consist
practices
in
the
lower
courts
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half.
the
state
courts
interestingly
enough
have
followed
the
same
rule.
except
this
change
by
statute,
i
believe
that
every
state
court
including
the
courts
of
mississippi.
all
that
a
court
has
power
to
punish
a
party
for
contempt
to
which
decrees
without
the
intervention
of
the
jury.
the
congress,
the
legislative
branch
has
also
repeatedly
acted
upon
the
view
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
trial
by
jury
in
cases
of
criminal
contempt.
that
view
was
implicit
in
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
which
was
enacted
by
congress
that
contained
very
many
members
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
would
of
course
propose
the
bill
of
rights
including
the
sixth
amendment.
the
contempt
statute
was
thoroughly
discussed
and
revised
in
1831
after
the
trial
competes
with
the
trial
of
judge
peck.
both
the
debates
of
the
revision
proceeded
upon
the
understanding
that
the
courts
have
power
to
punish
parties
for
violation
of
court
orders
without
the
intervention
of
the
jury.
beginning
in
1896,
there
was
the
continuous
debate
upon
a
contempt
bill
that
led
up
to
the
enactment
of
the
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
that
we've
been
discussing.
and
again,
the
distinguished
constitutional
lawyers
who
took
part
in
that
debate
accepted
the
premise
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
jury.
indeed,
the
issue
that
they
discussed
was
whether
the
constitution
permits
the
jury
and
of
course,
it's
now
settled
that
it
does.
the
clayton
act
proceeds
on
that
view
so
does
the
norris-la
guardia
act
in
1932
and
the
debate
in
the
civil
rights
act
to
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
enacted
in
1960.
thus,
i
think
i'm
amply
warranted
in
saying
that
the
rule
for
which
we
contend
is
deeply
woven
into
the
fabric
of
our
law.
i
submit
also
with
all
deference
that
the
issue
was
not
one
that
requires
reexamination,
especially
not
so
close
on
the
heels
of
the
decision
rendered
after
full
deliberation
in
1958.
unlike
a
goodly
proportion
of
the
cases
of
which
constitutional
precedents
have
been
reexamined,
there's
been
no
change
in
the
social
and
economic
conditions
that
give
rise
to
the
precedent.
the
old
doctrines
have
not
lost
their
probable
meaning
in
the
light
of
new
facts
nor
has
experience
demonstrated
that
the
consequences
of
the
doctrine
were
different
that
was
supposed.
the
procedure
is
exactly
the
same
as
it's
been
followed
for
over
a
century
and
its
impact
on
this
defendant
will
be
just
the
same
as
in
all
other
cases.
nor
do
i
think
that
it
can
be
argued
that
the
rule
of
constitutional
law
has
had
intolerable
consequences,
were
cited
to
know
evidence
in
increasing
resort
to
the
power
to
prosecute
the
criminal
contempt.
there's
no
suggestion
of
widespread
gross
abuse
of
power.
the
greatest
danger
misused
of
the
power
and
to
punish
criticism
of
the
court
has
been
confined,
has
been
met
by
statute
and
by
court
decision.
the
use
of
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
was
another
abuse
because
it
circumvented
jury
trial
and
provided
a
method
of
private
prosecution
instead
of
public
prosecution,
and
that
was
cured
by
the
clayton
and
norris-la
guardia
acts.
the
existence
of
such
statutes
and
i
would
like
to
stress
from
this
point,
also
shows
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
not
only
has
the
power
to
legislate
but
that
it
can
be
expected
to
legislate
effectively.
for
the
court
to
adhere
to
the
settled
law
here,
would
neither
progress
nor
perpetuated
justice.
congress
moreover
could
change
the
law
selectively
picking
and
choosing
between
the
different
cases
but
it
has
done
this
in
the
past.
it
chose
to
bar
views
of
contempt
power
by
providing
juries
in
appropriate
cases
without
interfering
by
--
with
trial
by
the
court
where
that
form
of
trial
is
indispensable
to
upholding
the
rule
of
law
and
securing
compliance
with
the
parties.
now,
what
i
have
said
thus
far,
of
course,
argues
that
green
against
the
united
states
is
a
sound
constitutional
decision
which
should
not
be
reexamined.
there
are
three
features
distinguishing
this
case
with
brief.
so,
that
even
if
that
decision
were
thought
to
be
erroneous,
or
someone
wish
to
hold
the
question
of
it,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
still
a
jury
trial
in
the
present
case
would
consistently
be
refused.
in
other
words,
whether
dissented
of
which
to
reserve
judgment,
as
i
say,
could
still
hold
that
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
--
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
present
case
at
reserved
judgment
on
the
case
like
green.
in
the
first
place,
in
green,
the
contempt
was
of
a
district
court.
here,
we
deal
with
a
contempt
proceeding
instituted
by
the
appellate
court
for
violation
of
its
own
decree.
the
dangers
of
arbitrariness,
unconscious
prejudice,
diversity
on
the
part
of
any
judge,
subject
these
judges
are
to
human
limitations
are
minimized
by
the
participate
--participation
of
at
least
three
and
perhaps
more
judges
of
an
appellate
court.
again,
requiring
a
district
court
to
summon
a
jury
where
punishment
is
necessary
to
vindicate
its
process
is
arguably
so
close
to
the
normal
procedure
in
the
district
court
for
punishing
other
offenses
of
law
that
the
exceptional
cases
can
and
therefore
should
be
assimilated
to
the
usual
case,
but
of
course
with
the
court
of
appeals,
a
jury
has
never
been
part
of
its
procedure
and
there's
nothing
to
which
to
assimilate
it
either
in
that
court
or
in
the
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
not
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
facilities
for
summoning
the
juror.
the
statutes
don't
provide
how
it
should
be
frozen
or
when
should
it
come.
indeed,
the
logic
of
the
defendants'
argument
is
that
neither
a
court
of
appeals
nor
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
has
power
to
punish
for
contempt.
if
for
example
according
to
the
logic
of
their
argument,
the
chief
justice
should
make
an
order
staying
the
execution
of
a
prisoner
in
the
state
capital
case
and
the
warden
went
ahead
and
executed
the
prisoner,
this
court
would
have
no
power
to
punish
the
violation.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
example
is
based
on
the
shipp
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
collect
those
cases
that
came
to
our
attention
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
i
would
say,
it
maybe
a
wild
guess
that
we
cite
somewhere
around
15
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
i
say
15
justice
stewart.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
so.
they're
on
pages
52
and
53
and
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
sometimes
--
sometimes
it
has
been
agreed.
this
was
done
in
the
shipp
case,
the
parties
stipulated
that
a
master
might
take
evidence.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
of
the
cases
i've
mentioned,
one
of
them
that
i
recall
is
an
nlrb
case.
usually,
civil
contempt
has
been
adequate.
usually,
the
fight
has
been
over
the
computation
of
back
pay
or
something
like
that
and
the
proceeding
has
been
in
civil
contempt.
the
criminal
contempt
is
very
rare
because
fortunately,
it's
very
rare
to
have
this
kind
of
defiance
of
court
orders.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mentioned
the
defendants
recognized
the
logic
of
their
argument.
they
said,
"yes,
the
court
of
appeals"
and
by
analogy
of
this
court,
the
exercise
of
its
criminal
jurisdiction
have
no
contempt
power.
that
would
mean
according
to
the
settled
law
that
no
one
could
punish
the
defendants
for
contempt
of
this
order
because
the
law
in
the
language
of
the
statutes
seems
to
confirm
it
is
that
only
the
court
whose
authority
is
violated,
they
punish
for
contempt.
my
second
reason
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
have
been
a
very,
very
great
question
about
it
mr.
justice.
the
statute
speaks
of
a
court
punishing
people
for
violation
of
its
authority
and
no
other.
and
the
cases
going
back
to
ex
parte
tillinghast,
4
peters
208
when
--
in
re
deems,
which
say
that
only
the
court
at
which
the
contempt
is
directed
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
it
was
the
authority
that
held
in
contempt
has
power
to
take
cognizance
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
certainly
the
implication
on
those
cases.
i
--
i
had
to
take
to
impress
them
farther
than
they
go.
there
are
the
square
holdings.
there
is
one
district
court
case
at
which
the
district
court
did
under
the
statute
i
think
remit
a
case
to
another
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
i'm
trying
to
suggest
--
not
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
there
are
grounds
for
distinguishing
what
i
may
call
the
dissent
in
green
from
the
present
case.
what
is
the
business
of
appellate
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
usually
in
the
same
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
justice
white
said,
i
--
i
don't
regard
this
as
of
the
essence
of
my
argument,
i
do
point
out
that
the
important
distinction
is
that
this
is
contempt
of
an
appellate
court,
the
other
cases
were
the
district
court
which
are
accustomed
to
deal
with
juries.
second,
although
we
argued
in
green,
and
i
believe
we'd
argue
again,
that
there
was
a
continuing
challenge
in
green's
conduct
to
the
effect
to
this
of
judicial
decrees.
still,
from
the
standpoint
of
one
who
rejected
that
argument
or
wished
to
reserve
judgment
upon
it,
the
quality
of
the
contemptuous
conduct
in
the
present
case
is
altogether
different.
green
was
concerned
with
a
normal
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law
to
the
prosecution,
bail
and
surrender
(inaudible).
well,
the
defendants
simply
disobeyed
the
order
and
to
surrender
himself
on
what
--
as
if
he
had
broken
away
from
the
marshal
or
escape
jail.
in
the
present
case,
barnett
not
merely
disobeyed
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
he
was
engaged
in
a
calculated
effort
to
prevent
others
from
complying
that
he
was
summoning
a
whole
power
of
the
state
to
vitiate
and
set
aside
the
adjudicatory
powers
of
the
federal
courts.
his
attempt
to
nullification
challenged
the
power
of
the
court
to
act
as
a
court,
it
wasn't
simply
disobedience.
they
threatened,
as
i
say,
that
principle
of
constitutional
adjudication,
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution,
not
the
whole
rule
of
the
law.
so
that
i
assume
for
a
moment
that
in
dealing
with
simple
disobedience
to
a
court
order,
that
because
of
the
ordinary
administration
of
criminal
justice,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
provide
for
the
intervention
of
a
jury
where
that
historic
power,
not
only
to
find
facts
but
to
acquit
a
defendant
and
disregard
of
both
the
law
and
the
fact,
exercising
an
arbitrary
power
of
dispensations.
but
in
vindicating
its
authority
to
adjudicate
and
bind
the
parties
by
a
forcible
decree,
a
court
should
not
be
left
dependent
upon
the
unanimous
support
of
12
jurors,
anyone
of
whom,
if
he
were
in
sympathetic
to
the
basic
adjudication,
could
block
conviction
and
best
stay
in
the
defendants
to
nullify
the
law.
our
constitution
guarantees
the
rights
of
unpopular
minorities.
the
courts
are
rightly,
zealously
protected,
but
the
judicial
protection
may
also
improve
hollow
if
the
vindication
of
the
courts
decree
could
be
prevented
by
the
whim
of
a
single
jury,
sympathetic
to
a
lawless
man
or
to
a
lawless
state
official.
then
at
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
decree
was
entered
in
this
case
as
there
might
be
numerous
cases
we
think
of.
this
decree
was
entered
to
sustain
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
unpopular
minority.
and
i
say
that
if
the
authority
of
a
court
to
make
such
a
decree
is
subject
to
attack
and
the
decree
cannot
be
vindicated
except
by
referring
the
issue
to
a
body
run
from
the
very
populous,
that
is
attacking
it
then
the
protection
of
the
unpopular
minority
is
likely
to
prove
very
slim
indeed.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
the
unpopular
criminal
defendant
is
challenging
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process,
the
legal
process
in
quite
the
same
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
he
is
realistically.
i
think
realistically,
he's
--
he's
violating
it,
he
is
disobeying
it
but
i
don't
think
he
under
minded.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
this
is
a
reason
i
suggest
for
distinguishing
this
case
and
for
maintaining
the
power
that
the
courts
historically
have
had.
if
i
may
perhaps
put
it
this
way,
then
we'll
bond
to
another
point
that
may
really
add
to
this,
justice
goldberg.
so
long
as
one
thinks,
it
appears
to
me,
of
the
court,
the
government
as
suppressing
it
to
--
a
--
a
precedent
to
few
free
people
then
the
power
of
the
jury
to
intervene
becomes
an
important
safeguard.
but
as
soon
as
one
begins
to
think
of
the
law
as
an
instrument
for
protecting
the
weak
and
the
oppressed,
as
an
instrument
for
securing
constitutional
rights
of
minority,
of
protecting
us
if
you
will
our
better
selves
against
our
worst
self,
then,
there
is
a
different
and
more
complicated
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that
brings
me
--
that
brings
me
to
the
third
essential
difference
between
green
in
the
present
case.
if
green
with
decree
--
commanded
green
to
surrender
himself
for
commitment,
he
disobeyed.
later,
he
came
in
and
was
committed.
his
acts
were
all
complete,
the
decree
was
exhausted.
the
court
was
concerned
wholly
with
punishment
for
past
events.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
not
a
crime
at
that
time.
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
in
--
in
the
present
case,
quite
the
reverse
is
true
or
was
true
with
the
contempt
citation
issues,
i'm
speaking
of
at
that
time.
the
original
decree
and
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
required
the
university
not
only
to
enroll
meredith
but
to
permit
him
to
continue
to
assess
and
obtain
an
education
without
discrimination.
the
order
directed
to
barnett
imposed
those
same
continuing
obligation.
when
the
court
issued
the
citation
for
criminal
contempt,
the
decree
far
from
being
spent,
imposed
future
obligations
upon
barnett.
the
court
was
still
concerned
with
his
future
compliance
at
the
contempt
proceeding,
although
it
was
labeled
criminal
because
it
did
look
in
a
sense
of
punishment,
it
was
ended
vindicating
to
bind
the
course
of
the
court's
decree
so
that
barnett
would
not
resume
a
future
course
of
nullification
of
those
very
decrees.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
a
situation
in
which
civil
contempt
was
an
adequate
mean
of
securing
affiance,
of
enforcement.
the
black
and
white
distinction
between
civil
contempt
which
were
described
in
the
classroom
as
a
means
of
enforcement,
criminal
contempt
or
we
describe
there
as
a
--
as
solely
concerned
with
punishment,
does
not
always
fit
the
realities
of
life
of
court
decrees.
it's
true
enough
to
say
that
when
a
defendant
is
imprisoned,
until
he
signs
the
deed
of
returns
an
heirloom,
if
there's
no
punishment
that
while
he's
sent
to
jail
coercively,
he
is
not
punished
because
he
has
the
key
to
the
jail
in
his
pocket
as
we're
saying.
whereas
if
he
destroys
the
heirloom
or
fails
to
surrender
himself
in
violation
of
a
decree
so
far
as
the
decree
is
spent,
then
the
situation
is
essentially
punishment
because
future
compliance
with
the
decree
is
impossible.
the
distinction
is
not
so
simple,
where
the
decree
imposes
on
the
defendant
a
continuing
obligation
to
refrain
from
unlawful
acts
that
he
has
committed
in
the
past
and
may
commit
again
at
any
time
for
some
period
in
the
future.
the
sheriff,
to
take
an
example,
who
engages
in
a
course
of
intimidation
or
coercion,
prevents
citizens
from
exercising
their
constitutional
rights
say
to
keep
them
for
registering
the
vote
or
to
keep
pickets
and
other
labor
organizers
in
the
company
town
from
exercising
the
right
of
free
speech,
is
no
threat
while
he
is
imprisoned.
the
problem
of
enforcement
arises
as
soon
as
he
is
free
unless
there
is
some
effective
punishment
for
past
violation.
in
the
present
case,
barnett
could
scarcely
frustrate
the
decree
while
the
troops
were
at
the
university.
the
problem
that
faced
the
court
of
appeals
both
when
it
ordered
the
attorney
general
to
institute
this
proceeding
and
later
was
essentially
one
of
restoring
the
principle
of
government
according
to
the
laws
under
normal
conditions
so
that
there
would
be
compliance
with
the
adjudicated
obligation
without
the
need
fore
force.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
first
place,
that
was
--
he
was
ordered
–
i
have
two
comments
on
that.
first,
that
was
directed
primarily
at
enrollment
and
i
am
now
seeking
to
emphasize
the
obligation
not
to
interfere
with
its
continued
attendance
which
would
become
a
problem.
he
had
promised
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
second,
mr.
justice
--
second,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
wonder
really
whether
its
civil
contempt,
it
was
proper
to
impose
imprisonment
or
a
fine
or
something
that
took
place
in
the
past
unless
you
do
something
in
the
future.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
thinking
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
it
confronted
there
and
of
course
the
very
problem
that
i
say,
exist
now.
that
there
is
no
way
here
of
compelling
barnett
to
comply
with
the
decree
in
the
future
and
i
emphasize
that
this
is
a
continuing
decree
unless
there
is
a
power
deciding
for
contempt
for
each
violation
as
it
occurs.
but
he
could
scarcely
--
he
gave
no
assurance
that
he
would
not
resume
his
prior
course
of
conduct.
the
events
that
you
referred
to
with
civil
contempt
led
his
attorneys
one
stated
in
open
court,
that
he
would
comply
with
the
order
insofar
as
he
was
able.
but
10
days
later,
they
retracted
that
and
a
little
after
that,
barnett
issued
a
public
statement
reserving
(inaudible)
himself
as
governor,
the
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
would
comply
with
the
injunction.
the
only
way
that
probably
still
essentially
one
of
compliance
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the
only
way,
the
only
available
process
for
preventing
nullification
was
to
--
for
the
court
to
have
available
power
to
impose
some
punishment
each
time,
a
subsequent
violation
occurred
and
that
seems
to
me
what
the
contempt
proceeding
looked
to.
