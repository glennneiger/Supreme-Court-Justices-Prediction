mr.
robert
kasanof
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court
and
ms.
rosenberg.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
basically
does
not
like
the
provisions
against
double
jeopardy
in
the
constitution
when
it
takes
the
provision,
the
position
it's
taken
here
today.
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy
is
not
the
protection
against
twice
being
convicted.
it
does
not
like
the
old
english
provisions
require
a
former
acquittal,
a
former
tender,
a
former
pardon.
it
is
a
protection
against
twice
being
as
required
to
endure
trial
to
be
exposed
to
jeopardy.
what
happens
in
this
case
was
that
a
man
the
federal
district
court
charged
with
a
serious
crime,
commenced
a
trial
before
a
jury
and
because
of
actions
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
which
the
government
now
concedes
were
coercive
in
their
affect,
he
never
finished
that
trial.
that
was
the
right
which
was
taken
from
him.
that
is
the
right
which
judge
tyler
found
could
not
be
restored.
now
it
is
true
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
and
i
agree
that
basically
the
rule
of
retrial
after
a
reversal
is
firmly
engrafted
in
the
law,
and
the
government
is
trying
to
curtail
this
depravation
of
a
jury
trial
into
a
retrial
after
reversal.
this
is
--
we
make
no
claim
that
the
fact
that
this
was
not
an
appeal,
that's
it's
a
collateral
attack
has
any
importance.
what
we
say
is
this,
essentially,
two
wrongs
were
done
to
the
defendant
tateo.
he
was
coerced
in
a
plea
of
guilty
and
a
judgment
was
entered.
when
he
went
for
judge
weinfeld
and
judge
weinfeld
set
aside
that
plea
of
guilty
and
that
wrong
was
remedied,
but
another
independent
wrong
connected
factual
part
and
parcel
happened
to
him
and
that
was
that
his
right
to
have
the
jury
originally
empanelled
to
hear
his
case
try
and
conclude
that
case
was
taken
from
him.
incidentally
government
is
very
solicitous
of
the
defendant's
rights
at
this
late
posture,
but
i
think
that
the
importance
of
the
jeopardy
provision
and
protection
maybe
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
though
the
government
did
not
ask
explicitly
this
involved
a
death
penalty
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial.
when
this
came
on
for
retrial,
the
government
and
the
court
below
indicated
at
pretrial
conferences
that
they
were
prepared
to
ask
for
the
death
penalty
after
the
seven
years.
they
were
prepared
in
effect
to
punish
the
defendant
for
having
set
aside
the
judgment
and
we
say
that
the
rule
in
green
has
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
in
order
to
vindicate
one
right
you
don't
have
to
borrow
or
bargain
away
another
right,
that
the
judgment
is
not
a
magical
touchstone.
we
concede
that
when
you
set
aside
a
judgment
to
the
measure
coequal
with
your
attack
on
the
judgment,
you
open
up
yourself
to
further
proceedings,
but
we
say
that
there
were
two
things
that
happened.
after
the
judgment
was
set
aside
case
came
on
again
for
trial
and
there
was
an
objection
made
that
coercively
the
defendant
tateo
had
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
have
the
jury
which
originally
set
out
to
hear
his
trial,
finish
hearing.
now
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
after
a
jury
verdict?
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
would
not
press
that
i
would
not
think
so.
i
think
that
the
critical
thing
here
and
ms
rosenberg
has
accused
us
of
being
i
think
hyper
technical,
the
critical
thing
here
is
our
system
of
justice
is
always
placed
a
special
value
on
the
right
of
jury
trial.
it
is
not
just
another
thing.
it
is
not
just
another
technicality.
not
every
jury
which
acquits
a
defendant
does
so
after
an
error
free
trial
and
there
are
cases.
i
don't
see
say
this
necessarily
would
have
been
one
of
them
but
it
is
to
sell
a
fundamental
american
right,
the
right
of
having
a
jury
of
peers
decide
it,
too
cheap
to
say
that
a
case
which
result
in
an
aborted
trial,
in
a
failure
to
get
to
the
jury
where
the
defendant
not
by
is
consent,
not
by
a
solicitude
on
the
part
of
a
court
for
his
rights,
but
by
a
coercive
action,
a
court
has
that
right,
the
right
to
have
his
case
considered
by
what
the
courts
often
call
his
jury.
there
comes
a
point
in
criminal
proceedings
when
both
sides
finally
must
get
--
come
to
a
final
litigation.
when
that
jury
is
in
panel,
when
that
case
begins,
something
very
special
has
happened
and
it
is
that
right
which
we
are
asking
this
court
to
protect.
mr.
robert
kasanof
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
the
right
of
appellate
review
which
is
not
always
been
with
us.
it
is
an
additional
benefit
conferred
on
the
defendant
above
and
beyond
the
right
of
jury
trial
and
he
gets
not
only
a
right
to
have
a
jury
consider
his
case,
but
he
gets
a
right
to
have
that
jury's
consideration
reviewed,
but
here
he
never
had
the
first
right,
the
basic
right
to
which
appellate
review
was
a
gloss,
an
addition,
a
further
benefit,
he
never
had
the
right
to
have
the
jury
consider
his
case
at
all.
the
mistrial
cases
have
consistently
held
and
i
think
the
rule
is
very
clearly
applicable
in
this
case,
but
that
unless
the
defendant
consents,
unless
there
is
some
imperious
necessity
there
is
no
suggestion
here
of
any
such
thing
or
unless
the
court
terminates
the
trial
because
of
a
solicitude
for
the
defendant,
well,
none
of
those
things
are
present
and
yet
the
trial
which
commenced
was
terminated.
it
was
terminated
coercively.
it
seems
to
me
a
strange
result
that
the
courts
in
addition
to
the
trial
being
terminated
coercively,
a
coercive
plea
was
taken
and
a
coercive
sentence
imposed
and
the
defendant
suffers
under
that
he
should
be
worse
off
now
than
if,
i'll
put
it
this
way,
the
trial
judge
had
said
to
counsel
of
the
(inaudible)
on
this
case
unpleasant,
don't
care
to
proceed.
if
you
insist
on
proceeding,
if
you
won't
move
from
this
trial
i'm
going
to
give
your
client
25
years
and
a
life
sentence
on
top
of
that.
if
counsel
had
gone
on
--
gone
out
and
under
the
shadow
of
that
kind
of
compulsion,
under
the
shadow
of
that
kind
of
threat
had
moved
for
mistrial,
when
that
case
came
on
for
a
retrial,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
plea,
a
former
jeopardy
would
certainly
have
been
sustained,
if
the
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
yes,
he
would
have
had
a
jury
verdict
and
juries
do
and
that's
why
we
have
juries,
that's
the
glory
of
the
jury
system
is
that
judges
do
not
snap
juries
through
hoops
your
honor
no
matter
how
coercively
and
it
may
be
that
most
cases
a
trial
judge
can
control
a
juror,
but
american
juries
that
anyone
who
sits
in
a
busy
trial
court
sees
jury
work
their
own
will,
the
will
of
a
consensus
of
justice,
their
own
idea,
very
often
a
trial
judge
can
mold
them,
but
not
always,
it
is
not
a
certainty
that
the
trial
judge
can
control
a
jury's
verdict,
by
no
means.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
but
that
question
was,
i
think
it's
conceded
that
the
impact
here
was
of
a
sort
that
just
overpowered,
the
defendant
was
over
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
no.
i
think
that
there
is
a
similarity,
but
i
think
that
again
the
critical
question
is
the
--
as
we
see
it
is
the
right
to
get
the
jury.
if
i
might
add
that
i
take
some
comfort
that
this
is
not
a
totally
irrational
view
from
the
fact
that
i'm
informed
that
next
month's
harvard
law
review
comments
on
the
re-prosecution
problem,
double
jeopardy
and
the
re-prosecution
problem
and
treats
favorably
judge
tyler's
decision
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
--
i
would
like
if
i
may
try
--
to
try
and
answer
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
troublesome
question,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
have
turned
the
emphasis
of
the
case
around
and
that
is,
why
this
case
really
is
basically
a
mistrial
case
and
is
not
a
reversal
case?
the
government
wants
to
treat
this
as
another
instance
of
something
that
has
gone
through,
come
to
judgment
and
has
come
back,
so
and
i
think
the
circumstances
in
which
the
judgment
was
arrived
at
here
are
extremely
important.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure
it
would,
i'm
not
sure
that
in
a
case
--
in
that
case
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
kasanof
what
--
you.
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
meant
that
the
trial
had
been
terminated
without
counsel.
if
the
trial
had
been
terminated
without
counsel
because
the
judge
had
pushed
an
unassisted
defendant
into
consenting
or
varying
a
mistrial,
i
think
that
that
defendant
would
be
protected
against
a
second
jeopardy
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
yes.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
think
that
would
be
much
closer,
but
i
would
say
that
that
--
and
by
the
standby
my
special
value
on
the
right
of
getting
to
the
jury.
i
think
that
that
is
what
the
mistrial
cases
mean,
that's
why
this
court,
i
take
it
in
downum,
the
prejudice
to
defendant
like
downum
who
sat
for
merely
two
days
if
that
case
had
been
adjourned,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
serious
question
he
would
--
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
claim
a
failure
of
speedy
prosecution.
mr.
robert
kasanof
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
he
would
be
put
after
his
collateral
attack
or
appellate
review,
what
have
you,
in
status
quo
ante.
he
would
be
back
where
he
was
before
the
harm
was
done
to
him.
that's
exactly
our
contention
here.
two
harms
were
done
to
him.
he
was
coerced
into
pleading
guilty
and
he
sets
that
plea
aside
but
he
was
also
coerced
out
of
a
jury
trial
after
four
days
of
trial
in
which
--
this
is
unlike
downum,
no
evidence
was
taken
in.
this
is
a
case
where
the
government
had
put
in
most
of
its
case.
four
days
of
jury
trial
makes
a
critical
difference
and
if
there
were
magical
way
to
avoid
the
passage
of
time
and
reassemble
that
jury
and
let
him
continue,
that
might
be
a
remedy.
but
the
passage
of
time,
the
discharge
and
separation
of
the
jury
forever
destroyed
in
effective
way
to
put
him
back
where
he
was
before
the
injury
was
done
to
him.
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
come
within
an
exception.
the
basic
--
a
basic
question
here
is
not
the
ball
rule,
which
the
government
speaks
of
so
eloquently,
the
basic
question
here
is
the
constitution,
which
prohibits
anyone
being
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
the
government
seeks
to
expand
an
exception
which
already
exists.
this
court
is
--
is
called
upon
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
it
will
give
a
narrow
constricted
meaning
to
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
we
say
and
i
think
the
double
jeopardy
protection
is
one
of
those
protections
which
everyone
talks
about,
laymen
and
lawyers
alike.
it's
like
every
man's
home
is
his
castle,
that's
double
jeopardy.
this
is
part
of
the
currency,
which
the
general
public
associates
with
all
fair
and
civilized
criminal
proceeding.
for
this
court
to
restrict
that
protection
does
no
service
to
the
cause
of
law
enforcement,
the
government
argues
that
they're
trying
to
concur
a
benefit
on
the
defendant
by
making
appellate
review
freer.
they
want
to
confer
that
benefit
by
abrogating
an
expressed
provision
of
the
constitution.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
benefit
which
defendants
or
society
at
large
needs
to
have
conferred
upon.
basically,
this
is
a
standard
mistrial
case.
the
subsequent
judgment,
coerced
judgment
does
not
alter
it.
it
seems
incredible
that
the
government
should
argue
that
tateo,
because
in
addition
to
being
coerced
out
of
his
jury
trial,
was
coerced
into
an
--
an
illegal
plea,
served
seven
years,
came
back,
the
government
reinstated
him,
threatened
him
with
the
--
the
electric
chair,
is
in
a
worst
position
than
downum.
and
that
is
what
i
take
to
be
the
essential
thrust
of
the
government's
argument.
we
do
not
attack
and
--
and
this
decision
does
not
involve
changing
the
basic
retrial
rule.
but
it
does
involve
something
that
has
a
real
practical
meaning
for
defendants
in
the
trial
courts
today.
there
is
a
pressure
on
the
district
courts
with
an
increasing
load
of
work
to
get
dispositions
to
move
things
along,
to
conclude
trials.
this
case
stands,
we
would
assert
for
a
simple
and
wholesome
salutary
proposition
that
when
you've
reached
that
point,
where
both
sides
have
joined
issue
and
a
jury
trial
has
commenced,
the
burden
of
an
improper
termination
of
that
trial
falls
on
the
prosecution
that
the
defendant's
liberty
cannot
be
twice
assailed,
that
it
can't
be
required
to
run
the
gantlet
twice
and
this
is
not
an
academic
case.
judge
weinfeld
speaks
in
his
opinion
setting
this
side
about
the
very
real
ordeal
of
this
trial.
the
government
wants
tateo
to
undergo
that
ordeal
again.
this
court,
when
it
extended
the
mistrial
rule
in
gori,
said
that,
"where
a
judge
acted
to
terminate
the
defendant's
right
of
jury
trial,
out
of
the
solicitude
for
the
defendant's
rights,
that
was
not
going
to
be
used
to
bar
retrial."
and
explicitly
in
gori
said,
"we
defer
the
question
on
whether
on
--
on
the
question
of
what
happens
when
the
judge
unwisely
or
arbitrarily
exercises
his
discretion
to
terminate
a
jury
trial.
you
have
here
an
unappealed
finding.
the
government
has
no
quarrel
with
judge
weinfeld's
finding
that
this
trial,
tateo's
constitutional
right
to
conclude
the
trial,
was
coercively
terminated.
the
government
does
not
question
the
correctness
of
judge
weinfeld's
finding
to
that
effect.
the
question
which
was
deferred
in
gori
is
here
today.
it
is
the
question
of
whether
when
a
defendant
in
a
federal
criminal
case
commences
his
jury
trial
and
the
judge
takes
that
right
from
him.
he
can
be
tried
again.
there
is
no
reason
for
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
plain
holding
of
the
mistrial
cases
that
the
government's
argument
is
that
because
he
is
worse
off
before
--
because
he
suffered
a
greater
harm,
he
should
have
fewer
rights
to
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy.
such
an
argument,
i
respectfully
urge,
does
not
sound
logically
and
doesn't
make
good
sense
in
view
of
the
kind
of
pressure
which
realistically,
day
to
day
working
trial
on
his
face
in
the
federal
criminal
courts.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
didn't
--
if
i
--
i
did
not
--
i
did
not
mean
to
express
that
thought.
i
don't
recall
exactly
what
i
said.
i
did
not
mean
to
express
that.
mr.
robert
kasanof
let
me
say
first
that
that
is
not
the
situation
or
anything
like
the
situation
here
because
judge
weinfeld
explicitly,
in
his
opinion
says,
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
defendant
faces
the
realities
of
how
a
trial
is
going.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
i
think
my
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
--
principle
would
reach
the
case
where
the
prosecutor
comes
into
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
then
says,
"we
are
going
to
press
for
the
death
penalty,
we
expect
to
get
it,
we
will
recommend
it,
we
--
we
will
--
we
will
use
every
--
every
resource
to
punish
you
for
seeking
to
--
punish
you
for
seeking
a
jury
trial."
that's
what
judge
weinfeld
found
here.
his
opinion
makes
it
very
clear
that
tateo's
right
to
continue
his
jury
trial
was
being
exercised
under
the
threat
of
a
penalty.
and
i
say
that
if
you
force
a
defendant
in
a
federal
criminal
trial
to
abandon
that
right
under
the
shadow
of
a
penalty
and
i
don't
care
where
the
penalty
comes
from,
whether
it's
the
government,
the
court,
i
would
say
that
when
he
is
forced
to
abandon
that
right,
he
cannot
be
tried
again.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
think
that's
something
you
have
to
look
at
specific
context.
i
can
see,
as
a
practical
reality
to
the
kind
of
fair-minded,
open
rational
discussion
between
prosecutors
and
defense
counsel,
which
we
all
know
goes
on
in
trial
of
criminal
cases,
and
i
can
see
the
same
factual
result
being
the
result
of
a
brutal
cruel
calculated
threat
and
attempt
to
punish
the
defendant
for
exercising
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
judge
weinfeld
found
that
this
was
a
threat
and
the
government
has
not
contested
judge
weinfeld's
finding
and
i
think
that's
as
far
as
we
have
to
go.
other
cases
would
turn
on
their
facts
but
i
think
this
--
the
mistrial
cases
and
i
think
there
are
no
exceptions
to
say
that
when
a
man
is
forced
against
his
will
and
--
and
certainly,
no
benefit,
no
tenderness
to
the
defendant
here,
nothing
like
gori,
but
bludgeoned
effectively,
objectively,
whatever
the
judge's
intention,
bludgeoned
out
of
his
right
to
complete
that
jury
trial,
that
ends
it
constitutionally.
he
can't
be
tried
again.
i
--
i
would
--
i
--
i
would
add,
of
course,
that
the
judge's
threat
is
far
--
has
a
far
more
ominous
flavor
to
it
than
a
prosecutor's
threat
as
the
judge
clearly
is
in
the
position
to
exercise
the
power
which
is
implicit
in
the
threat.
mr.
robert
kasanof
well,
it
was
--
it
was
prior
counsel
and
the
answer
is
no,
as
i
read
the
papers,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
can
answer
that
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
your
honor,
although
--
neither
the
government
--
i
don't
think
the
government
says
that,
no,
the
--
on
page
30
--
36
of
the
record,
it
is
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
again,
the
--
the
nearest
thing
to
that
is
to
be
found
on
page
39
where
the
defendant,
and
this
is
by
prior
counsel
so
i
take
no
either
pride
nor
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
page
--
pages
36
and
39,
"your
deponent
further
play
--
prays
that
this
court
thereupon
that
he
shall
be
granted
the
vacation
of
judgment
and
discharge
from
custody
or
in
the
alternative
to
be
rearranged
to
plead
de
novo
of
the
indictment."
well,
what
he
was
re-arraigned,
he
plead
de
novo
that
well-recognized
plea
in
bar
of
former
jeopardy.
i
--
i
don't
think
this
case
can
be
made
to
turn
on
scrivener's
errors.
i
think
the
question
is
--
is
squarely
before
you.
he
did
not,
in
so
many
words,
ask
for
a
new
trial.
he
asked
to
be
discharged
or
plead
de
novo.
he
plead
double
jeopardy
when
he
was
--
when
he
was
re-arraigned.
mr.
robert
kasanof
it
--
it
seems
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
don't
have
it
--
i
understand
that
--
that
it
--
it
authorizes
him
to
grant
an
--
the
construction,
which
i
understand
has
been
put
on,
to
grant
appropriate
relief
to
discharge
--
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
think
--
i
think
--
i
think,
towards
a
new
trial
appear,
i
just
don't
know.
if
you
ask
me
your
honor
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
that
we
--
that
we
make
out
any
part
of
our
case
on
the
--
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
make
out
our
argument
basically
on
the
question
that
when
that
jury
was
coercively
taken
away
from
him,
that
was
the
last
chance
the
government
gets
out
of
it.
mr.
robert
kasanof
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
absolute
--
i
don't
think
--
and
i
don't
think
2255
contemplated
this
--
this
sort
of
a
situation.
mr.
robert
kasanof
he
ordered
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
kasanof
but
judge
tyler
explicitly
found
that
judge
weinfeld
did
not
consider
this
question.
he
didn't
have
it
before.
i
mean
this
--
this
was
not
in
anyway
a
holding
by
judge
weinfeld
that
a
new
trial
was
indicated.
no
way
passed
on
the
jeopardy
question
which
was
never
tendered
to
him
by
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
kasanof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
kasanof
since
i
wasn't
the
author,
i
can
only
speak
from
the
objective
evidence
but
i
would
say
what
it
means,
is
that
he'd
be
permitted
to
plead
de
novo
which
he
did,
he
pleaded
double
jeopardy
under
the
plea
in
bar
and
the
interest
of
justice,
this
phrase,
other
and
further
relief
is
one
which
is
--
some
courts
insist
on
the
--
as
a
matter
of
practice,
some
district
courts
want
in
all
the
papers
in
case
they
modify
the
relief
in
terms
of
date
and
time,
submit
order,
that
i
think
is
a
practice
matter,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
in
terms
of
the
almost
liturgical
language
of
practicing
lawyers
who
put
this
in
to
permit
a
district
court
to
hear
it
on
a
monday
or
a
non-motion
day.
i
would
--
i
would
simply
once
again
reiterate
that
we
seek
here
to
vindicate
one
of
those
few
--
few
rights
in
the
area
of
criminal
procedure
and
there
are
relatively
few,
which
is
expressly
treated
in
the
constitution
of
united
states.
we
say
that
under
an
unbroken
line
of
cases,
the
termination
here
was
improper.
we
say
that
to
adopt
the
government's
policy
arguments,
for
abridging
that
expressed
provision
of
the
constitution
in
order
to
confer
some
imagined
benefit
in
terms
of
freer
appellate
review,
is
to
turn
justice
upside
down.
we
say
that
judge
tyler
was
right.
he
did
the
right
thing
in
reason,
law
and
fairness.
