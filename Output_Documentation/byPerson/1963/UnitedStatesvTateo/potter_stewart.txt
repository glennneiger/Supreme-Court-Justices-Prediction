stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that
point
ms.
rosenberg
and
i
realize
it's
not
your
point,
it's
your
opponent's
but
why
are
we
concerned
with
the
slim
chance,
the
chance
however
slim,
at
the
time
the
error
is
committed?
the
appellate
courts
are
faced
with
a
conviction
if
there
is
an
acquittal
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice

stewart
all
these
five
charges
go
out
one
bank
robbery.
justice
potter
stewart
your
basic
point
is
that
all
these
things
are
unimportant
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
kasanof
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
case
your
client
would
have
been
denied
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
by
his
jury
as
you
say
because
of
the
prejudicial
remark
by
the
trial
judge
before
the
jury,
and
yet
you
can
see
that
if
he
had
appealed
a
jury
conviction,
he
would
have
--
the
government
would
have
entitled
to
a
try
him
again.
