william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
(inaudible)
but
otherwise
there
is
direct
appeal
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
a
technical
distinction
this
2255
proceeding
was
directed
only
at
the
guilty
plea
on
the
other
accounts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
the
distinction
between
count
three
and
the
other,
the
only
judgment
that
was
formerly
entered
was
a
judgment
on
the
guilty
plea.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
no
judgment
of
any
kind
entered
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
judgment
of
dismissal
of
the
indictment
is
not
something
which
is
--
can
be
attacked
under
2255,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that
from
that
miss.
rosenberg,
if
i
understood
what
you
said,
it
was
that
the
relief
he
would
seek
against
the
judgment
entered
on
the
guilty
plea
was
relief
which
he
himself
had
sought
and
therefore
you
are
suggesting
that
the
same
retrial
principles
that
apply
on
direct
appeal
would
also
apply
here,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
on
the
kidnapping
obviously
you
can't
make
that
argument
as
dismissal
of
the
kidnapping.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
the
reason
you
make
the
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
speaking
of
the
harmless
error
rule
that
the
english
courts
applied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i'm
--
am
i
right
in
my
recollection
that
2255
explicitly
authorizes
the
judge
gaining
relief
under
that
section
to
direct
a
new
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
have
it
before
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
we
are
--
do
you
not
--
you
call
a
language
whether
to
just
grant
appropriate
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
what
--
what
the
statute
says,
i
have
it
now,
the
court
shall
vacate
and
set
the
judgment
aside
and
shall
discharge
the
prisoner
or
resentence
him
or
grant
a
new
trial
or
correct
the
sentences
may
appear
appropriate.
now,
what
did
judge
weinfeld
in
fact
did?
