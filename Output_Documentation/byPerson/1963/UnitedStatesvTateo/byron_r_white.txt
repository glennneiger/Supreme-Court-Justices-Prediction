justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
this
is
third
count.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
significance
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
part
of
an
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
plea
on
some
counts
that
the
government
would
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
making
the
same
argument
if
the
prosecution
had
--
the
prosecutors
simply
come
to
the
defendant's
counsel
and
said,
"look,
you,"
this
is
midway
in
the
trial,
"you
plead
guilty
to
three
counts
and
we'll
dismiss
the
--
we'll
dismiss
the
kidnapping
count."
and
the
lawyer
thought
it
over
and
said,
"alright,
we'll
--
we'll
do
that."
and
entered
the
plea
of
guilty,
he
was
sentenced
and
then
this
--
then
this
collateral
proceeding,
claiming
that
--
claiming
that
he
was
induced
to
terminate
the
trial
by
a
(inaudible)
on
one
count.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
principle
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
promise
to
--
if
you
requirements
to
dismiss
the
count
carrying
a
death
penalty,
where
are
--
is
that
--
is
that
any
less
coercive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
beg
your
pardon.
