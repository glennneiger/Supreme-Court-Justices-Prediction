chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kasanof
i
am
wondering
if
--
in
the
original
trial
if
the
judge
have
made
this
statement
this
coercive
statement
before
the
jury
instead
of
how
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
the
counsel
had
declined
to
plead
his
client
guilty
and
he
had
been
convicted
to
all
of
these
offences
and
then
on
2255,
he
was
--
he
received
relief
because
of
the
coercive
--
or
we'll
say,
we
say
that
--
suppose
on
appeal
the
case
was
reversed
because
of
this
coercive
statement
of
the
judge,
would
that
be
once,
twice
jeopardy
if
he's
tried
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
can't
always
control
the
defendant
in
his
council
either
can
he
and
to
--
and
pleading
guilty
is
your
mandate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
think
that
the
court
in
reversing
a
statement
that
the
trial
judge
made
in
open
court
would
be
doing
exactly
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
was
about
to
ask
you
just
as
we
--
we
adjourn.
suppose
this
man
had
never
gotten
to
a
jury,
suppose
on
arraignment,
the
judge
had
made
coercive
statement
of
that
kind
and
counsel
had
then
decided
to
plead
guilty
and
--
and
he
had
plead
guilty
and
it
was
reversed,
would
--
would
that
be
in
jeopardy
because
it
deprived
him
of
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
did,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
asked
for
a
new
trial
in
--
in
the
2255
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i'm
just
reading
judge
weinfeld's
opinion
and
he
said
accordingly,
the
motion
to
vacate
and
set
aside
the
judgement
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
conviction
entered
thereon
and
for
a
new
trial
is
granted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wasn't
he
testify
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
kasanof,
i
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
this
trial
for
relief
of
yours
isn't
a
sufficient
justification
for
--
for
what
judge
weinfeld
said
in
his
last
paragraph.
you
say
your
deponent
further
prays
this
court
that
thereupon,
he
shall
be
granted
the
vacation
of
judgment
and
discharge
from
custody
or
in
the
alternative
to
be
re-arraigned
to
plead
de
novo
to
the
aforesaid
indictments
and
for
such
other,
further
and
different
relief
as
to
this
court
may
seem
just
and
proper
in
the
interest
of
justice,
now,
isn't
that
in
essence,
a
request
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenberg
--
very
well.
