justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams,
is
it
evident
at
all
why
congress
passed
this
relation-back
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
had
this
precise
situation
in
mind,
the
prime
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
easier
you
amend
the
(inaudible)
and
it
has
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
barnett,
is
this
position
is
someone
inconsistent
with
your
argument
about
the
reason
for
passing
the
relation
back
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
wait
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
that
you
say
that
congress
really
didn't
cope
with
some
of
this
wording
and
that
this
was
by
accident
and
that
they
certainly
would
have
been
tended
to
have
thought
of
it
to
put
some
other
way,
but
if
they
passed
the
relation
back,
if
you
suggest
that
they
passed
the
relation
back
to
provision
just
to
take
care
of
despairing
of
the
situation
(inaudible)
then
that's
the
focus
on
the
problem
and
one
way
or
the
other
though
i
can't
see
how
that
can
be
both
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
doubt
at
all
in
1948
or
1954
or
1952
that
his
citizenship
could
be
revoked
for
the
reasons
that
it
was
ultimately
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
doubt
about
the
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
provisions
of
the
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
provisions
of
the
law
were
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
these
years
i
suppose
that
what
the
law
and
relation-back
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
as
in
52
and
before
that
in
second
circuit
explained
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
in
the
statute
by
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
in
the
statute
by
then,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
before
that,
the
law
was
clear
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
williams
and
mr.
barnett
this
quite
doesn't
take
care
of
my
trouble
and
i
suppose
you
may
not
be
interested
in
doing
so
either,
but
if
you
assume
that
congress
did
adopt
this
relation-back
change
in
the
law
to
cover
the,
just
this
kind
of
a
case,
whether
a
crime
is
submitted
when
a
person
was
a
citizen.
i
suppose
congress
must
have
been
worried
then
about
that
word
here
and
they
must
have
accepted
that
construction
which
you're
contending
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
really
have
no
problem.
