justice
potter
stewart
what
was
his
status
before
(inaudible)
in
italy
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
241
(b)
(2)
means
when
it
talks
about
such
crimes,
you
mean
the
first
one
or
the
second
one?
your
case,
you
--
mr.
costello
has
been
deported
because
he
was
convicted
of
two
crimes?
justice
potter
stewart
if
(inaudible)
convicted
of
one
crime
within
five
years?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
not
an
issue,
this
is
two
crimes?
justice
potter
stewart
then
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
what's
such
crime
mean
and
be,
first
crime
or
the
second
crime?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
for
the
--
.
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
second,
second.
justice
potter
stewart
they
all
are
from
--
the
whole
section
enacted
in
1952.
justice
potter
stewart
by
a
single
congress
–
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
he,
it
can
be
assumed,
he
thought
he
was
a
citizen
at
that
time
and
so
did
everybody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
(inaudible)
–
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
hadn't
been
guilty
of
fraud
no
matter
how
undesirable
he
might
be
or
–
he
obviously
couldn't
be
deported
no
matter
how
many
crimes
he
committed.
justice
potter
stewart
how
prior,
which
prior
status,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
other
one
is
going
to
his
prior
status?
justice
potter
stewart
because,
is
was
not
used,
some
other
form
of
the
word
to
be,
part
to
future
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
would
your
--
wouldn't
your
argument
apply
if
the
citizenship
had
been
defective
for
some
reason
other
than
fraud,
some
just
technically
defective?
justice
potter
stewart
for
some
technical
reason
after
its
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
affidavit
–
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
was
the
case
in
the
brancato
case
in
the
sixth
circuit.
i
think
there
was
some
technical
defect,
some
defect
in
the
affidavit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
distinction
was
sought
to
be
made
there
between
fraudulent
procurement
and
illegal
procurement.
justice
potter
stewart
if
congress
would
have
really
wanted
to
be
careful
along
the
lines
you
suggest,
they
would
have
enacted
in
each
one
of
the
sections
the
eichenlaub
language,
wouldn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
the
first
-
your
first
basic
point,
you
read
the
brancato
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
as
being
contrary
to
what
you
told
us?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
talking
about
--
i
have
it
right
here
and
the
next,
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
judge
miller?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
ruling
order
in
deportation
in
the
eichenlaub
case
which
is
based
upon
statute
of
1920,
which
was
a
special
statute
dealing
with
sabotage
and
espionage
during
the
first
world
war
and
that's
about
some
650
aliens
then
in
custody.
you
do
not
believe
that
the
construction
given
to
the
different
wording
of
that
statute
is
that
hold
the
general
deportation
statute,
which
we
are
now
considering?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
that
was
sort
of
related
to
the
relation-back?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
brancato
case
mr.
williams,
at
the
time
of
the
conviction
this
man
had
a
certificate
of
citizenship,
that
wasn't
considered
by
the
court
if
i
read
its
opinion,
the
basic
issue
in
that
case
is,
was
he
a
citizen
at
the
time
of
his
entry,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
five
years
prior
that
he
had
(inaudible)
back.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
