mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
an
alien
is
convicted
of
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude.
he
is
deportable
regardless
of
how
long
he
has
lived
in
this
country.
well,
that
maybe
a
harsh
application
of
the
deportation
statute,
but
the
validity
of
that
is
not
in
question.
the
only
question
as
justice
goldberg
noted
is
whether
the
petitioner,
for
the
statute
should
be
less
harshly
applied
to
the
petitioner
because
he
not
only
committed
two
crimes
but
also
committed
a
fraud
to
obtain
a
naturalization
certificate
which
has
been
revoked
for
that
reason.
there
are
two
branches
to
our
argument.
first
is,
the
deportation
provision,
section
241
(a)
(4),
does
not
require
that
the
person
to
be
deported
have
been
an
alien
at
the
time
of
his
convictions.
second
branch
is
that
even
if
it
does,
section
340
(a)
of
the
naturalization
provision
provides
that
the
denaturalization
shall
relate
back
to
the
date
of
the
naturalization
so
that
for
this
purpose
at
least
he
must
be
deemed
now
to
have
been
an
alien
at
the
time
of
the
convictions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
am
not
certain
of
241
(a)
(6).
let
me
say
that
we
agree
that
many
of
the
other
grounds
for
deportation
are
cast
in
different
language;
has
been,
shall
have
been,
have
been
or
may
hereafter
be.
our
estimation
of
that
is
that
the
1952
act
was
a
codification
basically
of
a
lot
of
existing
statutes
all
of
which,
many
of
which
were
cast
in
very
different
terms.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
am
quite
sure
that
is
not
the
case.
24
(a)
(4)
was
derived
from
the
1917
act
which
used
the
language
is
hereafter
sentence.
that
was
quite
completely
rewritten
primarily
to
overcome
this
court's
decision
in
fong
haw
tan
about
the
ambiguity
of
twice
sentenced.
so
it
was
quite
totally
rewritten.
i
think
the
use
of
the
years
however
have
come
from
that
source.
most
of
the
other
provisions
i
think
can
be
traced
back
to
other
statutes.
now,
i
am
not
sure
of
which
one
sixth
derives
from.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
yes
it
was.
but
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
senator
mccarran
i
think
in
the
openings
of
the
hearings
made
quite
a
point
however
the
fact
that
because
there
were
lot
of
rulings
interpretive
and
judicial
outstanding,
they
have
tried
not
to
change
things
for
the
sake
of
change
and
to
retain
old
statute
or
old
language
whenever
they
were
satisfactory
and
the
decisions
have
been
satisfactory.
now
our
argument
on
241
(a)
(4),
the
petitioner
quite
rightly
says,
there
is
not
that
his
reading
of
the
words
as
the
matter
of
language
is
impossible
and
if
that's
the
test,
then
we're
out
of
court,
but
i
think
that
is
not
the
end
inquiry.
our
argument
is
that
our
interpretation
is
necessary
to
make
sense
out
of
the
statute
in
relationship
to
the
other
provisions
and
to
avoid
what
we
think
are
quite
irrational
capricious
distinctions
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
and
also
the
authority
of
the
eichenlaub
case.
we
think
there
are
basically
four
very
fundamental
objections
to
the
interpretation
that
petitioner
would
contend
for.
now,
the
first
is
that
making
his
deportability
turn
up
on
or
making
deportability
turn
upon
the
prior
status
of
the
deportee
at
some
prior
time
simply
has
no
logical
relevance
to
the
purposes
of
deportation.
the
purpose
of
deportation
is
to
remove
from
the
country
those
who
because
they
are
now
aliens
remain
here
at
the
will
of
congress
and
who
congress
and
its
wisdom
concludes
are
no
longer
desirable
people
to
have
because
of
some
revealed
characteristics.
the
relevance
of
the
two-conviction
standard
is
the
congressional
judgment
that
a
man
who
has
been
twice
convicted
has
demonstrated
that
he
has
a
criminal
propensity,
his
quality
of
criminality
and
because
of
that
quality
he
is
no
longer
desired
as
a
resident
in
our
country.
that
is
the
whole
thrust
of
the
deportation
provision.
now,
if
that
be
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
at
the
time
he
was
convicted,
he
may
have
had
a
purported
citizenship
status,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
to
be
served.
the
conviction
of
the
two
crimes
equally
demonstrates
his
criminal
propensity
whether
he
held
at
that
time
a
naturalization
certificate
or
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
in
the
case
of
actual
fraud,
my
question
extend
to
which
he
is
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
cannot
deport
him
because
he
is
not
now
an
alien.
i
agree
that
being
an
alien
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
deportation,
but
the
time
at
which
this
is
relevant
is
the
time
of
the
deportation
proceedings
because
the
fact
that
he
has
been
an
alien
establishes
his
amenability
to
being
deported
and
his
precarious
tenure
as
we
mean
here
only
so
long
as
congress
considers
him
to
be
a
desirable
person
to
have
and
the
judgment
of
desirability
when
we
look
back
to
his
prior
conduct
to
draw
inferences
about
his
desirability,
his
prior
status
seems
to
me
wholly
irrelevant.
mind
you,
this
is
only
one
of
the
numbers
of
things
which
i
think
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
we
say
whether
or
not
he
was
a
citizen,
one
holding
a
defective
citizenship
or
an
alien
at
the
time
that
he
committed
the
crimes
and
the
time
he
was
convicted,
nevertheless
whichever
of
those
statuses
existed,
the
mere
fact
of
conviction
is
the
fact
that
establishes
his
criminal
propensity
and
it's
only
his
criminal
propensities
that
are
now
relevant
to
his
present
desirability
and
if
you're
now
an
alien,
and
is
presently
undesirable,
he
maybe
deported.
now,
the
second
objection,
i
don't
rely
on
any
one
of
these,
i
think
together
they
show
i
think
irresistibly
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
make
this
distinction.
the
second
is
that
the
fact
has
been
pointed
out
that
it
is
only
section
241
(a)
(4)
that
uses
the
language
is
and
it's
upon
that
one
word
and
that
tense
that
the
petitioner's
entire
argument
is
based.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
is,
the
fact
that
it
says
aliens
who,
any
alien
who
is
convicted
of
and
has
been
or
shall
have
been
and
the
other
ground
for
deportation
by
and
large
are
phrased
in
different
language;
has
been,
shall
have
been,
has
been
or
make
it
after
be
etcetera.
here
that
shows
this
is
the
purpose
of
differentiation.
we
suggest
quite
the
contrary
that
it
shows
that
congress
has
never
thought
of
these
tenses
as
being
the
key
to
the
applicability
of
the
provision.
under
petitioner's
argument,
an
alien
who
had
been
naturalized
and
was
convicted
of
various
other
crimes
and
whose
naturalization
is
clearly
revoked
would
be
admittedly
deportable
on
the
basis
of
pre
denaturalization
conduct
of
various
kinds.
he
might
be
deported
for
example
for
having,
while
holding
his
naturalization
certificate,
having
engaged
in
subversive
activities,
that's
sub-section
7,
having
been
a
drug
addict,
having
been
convicted
of
a
narcotics
violation,
having
been
connected
with
the
management
of
a
house
of
prostitution,
having
been
convicted
of
carrying
sawed-off
shotgun,
of
violation
of
the
alien
registration
act,
of
violating
various
wartime
statutes,
of
importing
an
alien
for
immoral
purposes.
all
of
this
panoply
are
grounds
for
deportation
would
under
their
argument
admittedly
apply
to
denaturalized
alien
under
basis
of
this
prior
conduct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
he
says
the
difference
is
intentional
and
for
this
purpose
and
we
say
there's
no
possible
reason
why
congress
would
have
made
that
discrimination.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
it,
none
is
apparent,
none
is
suggested
by
the
petitioner
and
to
the
contrary,
the
history
of
this
statute
is
deriving
from
discreet
statutes.
they're
all
collected
together,
suggests
that
the
difference
of
wordiness
is
the
accident
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
the
basic
act.
and
secondly
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
add
the
point
that
the
basic
committee
report,
the
result
of
the
original
study
in
describing
this
provision
uses
the
language
has
been.
now
i
don't
put
too
much
weight
on
that
other
than
to
show
that
congress
was
not
conscious
of
the
importance
of
these
tenses,
is
or
has
been.
committee
report
does
describe
both
the
existing
statutes
and
the
new
ones
in
past
tense
language.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
i
would
like
to
develop
the,
development
of
the
relation
back
provisioned
later.
i
don't
think
it
is
the
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
think
it
might
be.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
like
to
defer
the
development
relation
back
to
them.
he
might
then
challenge
me
for
the
inconsistency.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
congress
was
that
subtle
in
adopting
the
relation
back
provision.
i
would
try
to
show
that
that
was
directly
in
response
to
the
fact
that
this
court
reserve
the
question
in
eichenlaub
and
i
will
try
to
deal
with
your
problem
when
i
come
to
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
didn't,
they
didn't
address
themselves
to
the
issue.
all
i
said
is
that
in
describing
it,
just
a
narrative
description
of
what
these
provisions
were
about,
the
committee
speaks
of
any
aliens
who
have
been,
that's
in
a
brief
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
not
because
they
introduced
the
bail
at
the
same
time
the
report
was
filed
and
the
report
recommended
the
retention
of
the
provisions
providing
for
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
have
been
convicted
and
at
the
same
day,
the
same
day
that
the
report
was
filed,
senator
mccarran
filed
the
basic
omnibus
bill,
mccarran
having
been
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the,
well,
one
way
or
the
other
he
shouldn't
have
introduced
the
report
of
he
shouldn't
have
introduced
the
bill,
but
if
he
was
aware
of
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
govern
by
the
bill
and
i'm
not
really
trying
to
place
that
much
reliance
on
the
report
because
it
was
not
focused
on
in
the
report.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
point
in
response
to
question
that
there
is
this
usage
in
the
report
which
i
say
really
it
doesn't
--
if
it
does
show
anything,
it
shows
a
lack
of
awareness
or
the
significance
of
tense.
now,
that
isn't
–
i
don't
suggest
that
is
the
answer
to
the
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
if
the
tense
is
important,
i
think
it
does
indicate
that
congress
was
unaware
of
that
significance.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
fact
that
the
report
in
describing
the
provision
which
allegedly
has
this
very
significant
tense
is
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
this
application,
it
was
described
–
well,
i'll
read
you
what
the
report
says.
this
is
at
page
14,
15
of
our
brief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
well,
i
don't
think
anyone
who
thought
that
was
significant
that
is,
made
the
difference
would
have
written
a
report
that
shifts
tense
into
another
tense.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
would
support
my
argument
i
think,
that
they
didn't
mean
it
to
be
applied.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
it
maybe
they
did.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
did.
now,
i
don't
think
that
prove
that
they
didn't.
i
just
offer
that
as
a
one
of
circumstances.
i
don't
think
it's
that
important
aspect
of
the
case.
i
think
the
inconsistency
is
produced
by
the
interpretation
are
really
much
more
important
than
telling
what
congress
might
have
intended
by
this
provision.
the
third
one
which
has
been
pointed
out
is
that
it
does
give
a
preference
to
aliens
who
were
guilty
of
fraud.
he
would
be
deportable,
but
for
the
fact
that
he
fraudulently
obtained
a
naturalization
certificate
and
he
claims
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
if
it
were
revoked.
we
don't
say
it's
void,
we
say
it's
voidable,
had
it
been
cancelled
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
i
think
we
don't
make
that
much
of
a
point
of
it.
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
we
have
a
footnote,
noting
a
subsequent
change
in
the
statute
which
the
1952
act
can
find
the
grounds
for
denaturalization
to
fraud,
willful
misrepresentation
or
concealment.
in
1961,
they
added
back
to
the
statute
as
a
ground
for
denaturalization
illegal
procurement
which
would
also
include
the
fact
it
didn't
satisfy
the
resident's
requirements,
however
innocent
he
may
have
been
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
am
not
sure
what
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yeah,
i
think
the
fraudulent
representation
there
was
about
the
technical
defect.
i
am
not
sure
that's
the
case.
no,
no,
you're
quite
right,
you're
quite
right.
but,
nevertheless
a
consequence
of
it
would
be
to
prefer
the
one
who
makes
the
willful
misrepresentation
and
finally,
finally,
if
the
prior
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
there
is
a
possible
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
is
a
possible
argument
that
the
relation
back
provision
doesn't
pick
up
that
new
ground
for
denaturalization.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
that
i
think
the
relation
back
is
the
simpler
and
more
conclusive
ground
for
deciding
the
case
and
is
somewhat
less
sweeping
in
its
interpretations,
it's
a
narrower
ground,
whether
it
picks
up
this
new
ground
for
denaturalization
is
unclear,
literally
it
would.
now,
the
fourth
objection
is,
that
if
prior
status
were
to
be
made
important,
if
congress
meant
to
make
it
important
and
to
provide
and
in
effect
to
recognize
the
de
facto
status
of
citizenship
is
some
kind
of
protection
for
what
was
done
while
he
was
(inaudible)
even
though
fraudulent
or
however
he
got
it.
the
relevant
time,
the
logical
time
to
make
status
important
would
be
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
acts
not
at
the
wholly
fortuitous
time
of
conviction
which
maybe
many
years
later.
this
statute
as
petitioner
reads
it
and
it
can
be
read
this
way
makes
status
on
the
date
of
conviction
controlling
whatever
his
status
was
on
the
date
that
he
committed
the
acts,
that
is
to
say
if
in
this
case
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
no
no,
conviction
should
be
a
requirement
but
if
congress
meant
by
this
to
protect
some
one
in
his
exercise
of
his
prior
status
when
he
was
a
citizen.
anything
he
did
while
he
was
a
citizen
shouldn't
be
made
a
basis
for
deportation.
if
that
was
the
purpose
and
from
possible
reasons
to
make
status
important,
logically
i
say
the
important
time
to
look
at
the
status
is
that
the
time
that
he
did
the
acts
and
if
he
was
the
citizen
when
he
did
the
acts
you
should
say
it
ought
not
count
against
him.
but
their
argument
is
if
he
commits
the
crimes
as
a
citizen,
holding
a
naturalization
certificate,
his
naturalization
certificate
is
then
revoke
and
he
is
thereafter
convicted
for
his
prior
acts.
they
would
admit
that
he
is
deportable
and
i
say
that
it's
a
wholly
irrational
way
to
make
prior
status
relevant
and
i
think
it
shows
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
because
it
would
having
that
to
make
it
relevant
at
the
time
of
commission
and
not
at
the
time
of
conviction.
now
i
think
all
of
these
inconsistencies,
and
irrationalities
resulting
from
petitioner's
interpretation
would
require
his
rejection
even
if
it
were
an
open
question
but
i
don't
think
it
is
an
open
question,
i
think
it
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
eichenlaub
case
at
338
us.
now
the
fact
in
statute
we
say
all
respects
parallel
in
eichenlaub.
eichenlaub
was
naturalized
in
1936,
convicted
in
1941,
denaturalized
in
1944.
he
was
thereafter
sought
to
be
deported
under
the
statute,
it's
set
forth
at
page
19
of
our
brief,
which
speaking
as
of
the
date
of
this
enactment
which
is
1920
says
provides
for
deportation
of
"all
aliens
who
since
august
1,
1914,
have
been
or
may
hereafter
be
convicted"
of
the
crimes
listed
one
of
which
was
the
crime
of
which
eichenlaub
was
convicted
that
--
since
eichenlaub
was
convicted
in
1941
long
after
the
statute
the
relevant
language
of
the
statute
is
"all
aliens
who
may
hereafter
be
convicted
of
such
a
crime”
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
exactly
the
same
argument
could
be
made
about
the
meaning
of
that
language
as
it
is
made
about
the
meaning
of
this
language
and
in
fact
it
was
made.
this
court
however
rejected
it.
it
said
that
all
the
statute
required
is
that
you
be
an
alien
at
the
time
of
the
deportation
proceedings
and
that
you
be
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
such
a
crime.
now
not
only
is
the
language
identical
or
is
a
same
question
but
the
reasons
the
court
gave
for
its
decision
are
equally
applicable
here,
they
are
basically
the
same
ones
i've
been
arguing.
its
decision
rests
primarily
on
the
lack
of
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
made
the
prior
status
relevant,
the
anomaly
or
irrationality
of
--
if
prior
status
were
be
relevant
of
looking
to
the
time
of
conviction
rather
than
a
time
of
commission
and
finally
the
anomaly
of
allowing
an
alien
who
had
fraudulently
obtained
citizenship
and
had
it
cancelled
to
plead
his
fraudulently
acquired
and
since
cancelled
status
as
a
defense
to
deportation
and
those
reasons
we
say
are
equally
applicable
to
this
case
and
eichenlaub
fully
controls
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
maybe
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yeah,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
except
for
the
reasons
given
by
the
court
may
have
a
broader
impact
than
the
identity
of
the
language,
but
i
do
argue
that
it
is
conducted
and
maybe
conducted
and
have
the
same
implications
for
this
purpose.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
scolberd
of
section
6
drives
from
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
which
you
will
find
in
our
brief
at
page
16
in
the
discussion
of
the
main
language.
before
i
leave
my
first
point,
i
like
to
acknowledge
the
eichenlaub
decision
was
decided
by
four
to
three
court
and
does
not
represent
an
absolute
majority
court
nevertheless
we
urge
that
it
is
entitled
to
be
followed
based
on
three
reasons.
first,
because
it's
right,
secondly
because
it
--
even
though
it's
four-three
decision,
it
is
the
decision
of
this
court
and
the
reason
why
that
need
to
be
disregarded.
and
finally,
because
i
think
since
it
is
more
real
here
than
usually
is
the
case,
congress
has
relied
upon
in
enacting
the
1952
act.
it
not
only
did
reenact
the
very
provision
involved
in
eichenlaub
in
sub-section
17,
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair,
at
least
possibility,
i
would
think,
i
would
be
quite
confident,
that
had
the
eichenlaub
decision
been
decided
the
other
way,
and
the
court
had
felt
that
the
tense
maybe
implied
that
he
had
to
be
an
alien
at
that
time,
that
congress
would
have
revised
the
provisions
using
that
kind
of
language
to
remove
the
possibility
of
that
interpretation.
the
eichenlaub
decision,
however,
removed
in
a
reason
to
rescan
the
provisions
to
take
out
any
provisions
that
would
pose
that
problem.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
the
other,
the
other
section
used
has
been
i
think
would
not
pose
the
problem.
it's
only
i
think
sub-section
4
is
really
the
one
that
might
pose
problem
besides
the
eichenlaub
statute
itself.
and
as
to
congress
being
very
sure,
i
think
i
hope
to
show
it
in
order
to
be
very
sure
it
adopted
the
relation-back
provision
that
we
will
turn
to
that
now.
so
they
say,
i
think
the
more
satisfactory
or
at
least
simpler
and
i
think
more
conclusive
base
to
decide
the
case
is
really
the
relation-back
provision
of
section
340
(a).
well
that's
in
our
brief,
like
most
conveniently
pages
25
and
26.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
that
is
relevant
really
only
to
the
second
point,
relation-back.
in
that
case,
the
statute
there,
that
was
an
exclusion
or
that
was
the
conviction
within
five
years
after
entry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
am
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
does
mostly
seen
in
brancato.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
argument
about
his
status
as
an
alien
at
the
time
of
conviction.
the
only
argument
that
he
made
an
entry
so
that
one
crime
was
sufficient
and
on
the
entry
argument
the
issue
was
further
his
denaturalization
related
back
to
make
him
an
alien
at
the
time
of
the
entry.
i
like
to
develop
the
relation-back.
we
don't
dispute
the
result
in
brancato.
some
of
the
language
i
take
it
we
would
disagree
with.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
that's
right.
section
340
(a)
is
the
basic
denaturalization
provision.
it
provides
seniors
to
denaturalize
persons
who
obtain
their
citizenship
by
willful
misrepresentations
and
then
add
in
a
provision
which
is
new
to
the
1952
act
that
such
revocation
and
setting
aside
of
the
order
admitting
him
for
citizenship
shall
be
effective
as
off
the
original
date
of
the
order
and
certificate.
thus
in
this
case
denaturalization
order
shall
be
effective
as
of
1925
and
we
think
giving
that
literal
and
natural
meaning,
it
means
that
costello
must
now
be
deemed
to
have
been
an
alien
through
out
the
period
of
time
that
he
held
a
naturalization
certificate.
now
i
want
to
hasten
to
add
that
we
don't
argue
that
the
relation
back
provision
can
be
applied
quite
that
simply
or
mechanically
and
if
you
do
have
to
look
to
its
purposes
and
to
some
extent
can
confine
to
an
area
which
congress
seems
to
have
intended
it
to
apply.
what
i
want
to
show
is
that
in
fact
this
is
the
central
purpose
of
the
provision
was
this
application
in
this
very
context.
now
as
i
take
a
basic
agreement
between
us
and
the
petitioner
but
the
relation
back
petition
was
at
least
in
some
sense
a
codification
of
existing
law,
it
didn't
spring
new
born.
but
what
that
existing
law
consisted
off
is
very
important
and
we
say
consistent
basically
four
court
of
appeals
decisions
plus
a
reservation
from
the
question
by
this
court
in
eichenlaub.
now
to
be
sure
there
were
some
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
not
all
involving
really
an
application
of
relation
back,
language
that
suggests
that
one
who
acquires
a
grant
by
fraud
takes
nothing
by
his
paper
grant,
that
sort
of
general
language
you
find
might
be
the
nullity
but
the
first
real
application
of
the
relation
back
doctrine
came
in
1932
in
a
decision
by
third
circuit
in
rosenberg
versus
united
states,
60
f.2d.
in
that
case
the
court
held
or
at
least
opined
because
in
fact
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
that
what
it
said
to
the
issue
within
court,
but
it
at
least
said
that
a
woman
who
had
been
married
to
a
naturalized
citizen
whose
citizenship
was
later
revoke
because
of
fraud
was
herself
not
a
citizen
and
she
would
have
been
–
had
he
been
a
citizen
when
she
married
him
and
in
doing
so,
it
simply
said
that
since
the
citizenship
was
cancelled
for
fraud,
he
never
was
a
citizen
and
therefore
she
could
never
been
the
wife
of
a
citizen.
the
next
case
at
the
appellate
level
was
the
decision
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
eichenlaub
case.
that's
the
same
case
i
discussed
which
is
reported
at
167
f.
2d
and
in
that
case
in
response
to
the
claim
that
eichenlaub
cannot
be
deported
because
he
was
not
an
alien
at
the
time
he
was
convicted.
the
court
of
appeals
responded
simply
that
the
degree
of
naturalization
relates
back
at
least
for
that
purpose
and
disposed
of
the
case
specifically
on
that
ground.
by
the
year
later
in
the
willumeit
case,
again
in
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
reaffirmed
that
holding
after
full
argument
on
very
issue
and
beside
of
that
case
and
the
relation
back
that
involved
exactly
the
same
issue
as
eichenlaub
deportation
and
time
of
conviction.
about
3
months
after
that
the
second
circuit
decided
another
case,
the
battaglino
case
at
172f
2d,
that
was
a
derivative
citizenship
case
and
the
court
held
that
the
son
of
a
naturalized
citizen,
the
son
being
born
and
brought
and
his
father
later
been
denaturalized
for
fraud
in
that
case
presumptive
fraud,
but
the
son
was
not
a
citizen.
for
this
simple
reason
that
since
the
father's
citizenship
was
revoked
because
of
invalidity
ab
initio
that
father
was
not
a
citizen
where
their
son
was
born
and
therefore
he
was
not
a
citizen.
now
i
want
to
emphasis
that
all
of
those
cases
the
courts
applied
simply
a
monolithic
concept
of
the
retroactive
effect
of
denaturalization.
they
reasoned
simply
that
since
the
father's
citizenship
was
revoked
for
initial
defects,
he
never
was
a
citizen
and
therefore
was
not
a
citizen
either
at
the
time
that
his
son
was
born
or
at
the
time
he
was
convicted
or
whatever
was
the
relevant
time
and
no
one
could
justify
slightest
distinction
and
the
application
of
that
principle
as
between
the
two
purposes.
in
the
next
event,
after
those
cases
were
decided
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
willumeit
and
then
vacated
its
prior
denial
of
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
only
in
a
procedural
context
and
not
at
all
with
the
implication
that
at
least
i
would
say,
the
implications
petitioners
give
to
that.
his
--
the
case
involved
here
is
denaturalization.
they
didn't
really
involve
first
status
at
all.
after
final
judgment
was
entered,
and
the
time
for
any
further
action
had
expired,
she
sought
to
intervene,
claiming
that
the
service
is
trying
to
deport
her
and
therefore,
she
should
be
allowed
to
intervene.
the
court
opens
up
its
discussion
that
the
question
deportation
isn't
before
us,
and
all
that
we
are
deciding
is
whether
she
should
intervene,
it's
in
that
procedural
context
that
they
made
the
statement.
when
later
they
said
which
i
grant
you
may
very
well
be
difficult
what
they
say
about
her
status
that
wasn't
really
the
issue
at
all
and
at
that
point,
they
in
no
way
(inaudible)
the
distinction
on
the
relation-back
question
as
between
the
two
consequences.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
i
will.
now
the
next
step
as
i
say
was
this
court's
decision
in
eichenlaub
and
willumeit,
they
were
combined
and
because
this
court
as
i
pointed
out
decided
the
case
rather
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
did
not
require
alienage
and
did
not
rely
on
the
relation-back
theory
as
the
court
of
appeals
had.
it
did
however,
at
least
stayed
the
relation-back
issue
and
because
what
it
said
about
that
provided
the
final
prelude
to
the
legislation
we
set
it
forth
in
full
in
our
brief
at
page
33.
what
the
court,
after
stating
the
issue,
says
is
that
the
government
suggests
that
one
route
to
a
conclusion
on
this
issue
is
to
hold
that
the
relators
as
a
matter
of
law
were
“aliens”
when
so
convicted.
the
basis
it
suggests
for
so
holding
is
that
the
judicial
annulment
of
the
relators
naturalizations
on
the
ground
of
fraud
in
their
procurement
deprived
them
of
their
naturalizations
ab
initio,
citing
rosenberg.
they
thus
would
be
returned
to
their
status
as
aliens
as
of
the
date
of
their
respective
naturalizations.
and
accordingly,
they
would
not
be
liable
to
deportation
if
you
read
the
statute
it
was
requiring
aliens
and
then
they
say
in
our
opinion
it
is
not
necessary,
for
the
purposes
of
these
cases,
to
give
a
retroactive
effect
to
the
denaturalization
orders
but
rather
we
can
decide
it
on
the
ground
they
did
decide
it.
now
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
effect
about
what
the
court
there
said,
was
to
leave
the
relation-back
doctrine
which
after
all
was
that
well
settled
in
any
event,
it's
only
been
these
four
cases
rather
than
really
giving
very
extended
treatment
to
it,
was
to
leave
that
question
entirely
up
in
the
air,
nothing
was
settled.
the
court
preferred
not
to
rule
on
that
question
and
it
provided
i
suggest
more
than
ample
occasion
for
congress
which
was
now
already
engaged
in
a
complete
restatement
of
the
law
of
integration
to
settle
the
matter,
once
and
for
all.
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
exactly
what
congress
did.
less
than
20
months
after
the
eichenlaub
decision,
senator
mccarran
in
introducing
revived
version
of
the
bill
that
ultimately
became
the
law,
included
for
the
first
time
the
express
provision
that
such
revocation
shall
be
effective
as
of
the
date
of
the
original
naturalization.
i
might
note
that
the
language
parallels
the
opinion
in
the
sense
the
opinion
refers
to
the
argument
as
been
that
they
would
be
returned
to
the
status
as
aliens
as
of
the
date
of
their
respective
naturalizations.
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
the
only
explanation
for
the
edition
of
that
provision
of
the
statute
was
to
settle
the
question
the
court
had
not
settled
and
to
write
it
into
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
about
the
reason
for
that
addition.
it
was
not
in
the
original
bill
that
senator
mccarran
introduced
together
with
the
study
report.
the
decision
was
in
january
1950
and
the
original
bill
and
study
report
were
introduced
in
april
in
1950,
some
94
days
after
the
decision
in
eichenlaub
and
that
bill
did
not
contain
a
relation
back
provision.
the
study
report
is
actually
committee
report,
the
result
of
there
two-and-half
year
study
of
the
whole
area
was
that,
the
relevant
part
is
set
for
page
31
of
our
brief,
at
that
time
had
said
the
effect
of
a
decree
of
denaturalization,
as
distinguished
from
expatriation
or
forfeiture
of
citizenship
is
to
declare
that
the
naturalize
person
never
was
in
fact
naturalized
because
either
by
fraud
or
illegality,
the
statutory
prerequisites
were
not
met.
now
at
that
point
in
time
which
is
too
much
after
the
eichenlaub
decision
one
might
think
the
author
of
this
statement
had
failed
to
take
account
of
fact
supreme
court
at
least
treated
the
question
as
in
open
one.
i
can
prove
that
i
think
925-page
comprehensive
report
in
the
immigration
law
is
not
likely
to
reflect
the
events
as
recent
as
three
months
ago.
in
any
event
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
the
substance
of
what
was
contained
did
not
reflect
the
doubt
that
would
be
i
think
reasonably
created
by
this
court's
treatment
of
the
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
i
want
you
first
by
the
history
is
that
you
was
specifically
a
response
to
this
kind
of
application.
now
the
statue
is
not
so
limited
and
there
is
a
problem
of
what
other
consequences
it
had.
i'll
argue
that
certainly
this
is
this
minimum
application
and
we
acknowledge
that
there
maybe
serious
questions
about
to
attempt
to
apply
it
literary
in
all
contacts
for
every
conceivable
purpose.
now
that
i
don't
think
was
anything
unusual
about
that
process
of
statutory
interpretation
that
a
statue
which
literally
would
seen
them
include
a
great
deal
more
can
be
construed
as
not
having
been
intended
to
cover
various
kinds
of
issues
that
were
seen
not
be
anticipated.
what
i
want
to
show
is
this
application
was
specifically
anticipated.
the
prior
law
existed
of
two
application,
consisted
of
two
applications.
the
derivative
citizenship
consequence
and
the
issue
of
status
at
the
time
of
the
conviction
for
deportation
purposes,
that
wasn't
the
prior
law
and
that
context
this
court
declined
to
the
decide
the
question
and
then
20
months
later
senator
mccarran
adds
it
to
his
bill
and
i
say
that
that
is
as
conclusive
proof
as
one
can
have
without
having
a
report
explaining
it
and
there
was
no
report
explaining
why
it
was
later
added.
as
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
no,
it
was
added
--
the
initial
bill
was
introduced
as
i
say
within
three
months
after
eichenlaub
decision.
it
begin
in
the
next
session
of
congress,
senator
mccarran
congressman
walters
introduced
companion
bills
containing
some
further
revisions.
they
then
had
joint
hearings
and
after
the
joint
hearings
senator
mccarran
introduced
a
new
bill
with
a
lot
of
changes
in
it,
let
me
do
track
i
don't
know
how
many
changes
some
changes.
one
of
the
changes
that
mate
bill
the
first
time
was
the
addition
of
the
relation-back
provision
and
i
say
the
reason
it
wasn't
in
the
first
bill
and
it's
not
really
important
why
it
wasn't
the
first
bill,
but
i
think
the
reason
it
was,
is
they
accepted
the
study
report
statement
of
the
existing
law.
then
when
this
court
when
it
circulated
down
that
this
court
had
thrown
that
up
in
the
air
they
then
added
it
to
the
bill
to
settle
the
question
and
i
say
the
one
application,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
intended
the
relation
back
provision
to
have
was
the
very
context
of
this
case.
now
the
petitioner's
argument,
another
objection
to
the
petitioner
arguments
they
seem
to
argue
that
the
affect
the
only
reason
for
it
was
to
settle
the
derivative
citizenship
question.
now
first
of
all
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
prior
decisions
since
the
(inaudible)
distinction,
nothing
in
this
court's
decision.
eichenlaub
raised
any
doubt
about
the
equal
applicability,
it
raised
that
about
the
whole
thing,
but
more
than
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
well
it's
--
eichenlaub
and
willumeit
themselves
in
the
second
circuit.
that's
right,
but
when
you
say
all
of
the
other
cases
that
implied
a
great
body
of
established
law
in
this
as
a
single
extension
but
that
is
not
the
case.
rosenberg
was
decided
and
as
dicta
basically
suggested
this
(inaudible).
the
next
two
cases
were
the
second
circuit
cases
in
eichenlaub
and
willumeit
which
applied
it
for
this
purpose,
then
in
the
second
circuit's
case
three
months
later
in
(inaudible)
which
applied
it
for
derivative
citizenship
purposes
and
it
was
right
after
that
that
the
question
came
to
the
supreme
court
in
eichenlaub
and
willumeit.
now
the
further
answer
is
that
the
original
bill
contained
for
the
first
time
what
is
now
in
section
348
(f)
expressly
proving
affirmatively
for
the
consequences
of
denaturalization
upon
derivative
citizenship
that
was
no
longer
left
the
relation
back
doctrine.
so
at
the
time
with
the
relation
back
doc
--
provision
was
added,
that
was
already
in
the
bill
a
special
provision
to
take
care
of
derivative
citizenship.
that
cannot
be
the
explanation
of
why
relation
back
was
added.
the
only
other
application
in
existing
law
was
the
application
for
this
very
purpose
and
we
say
that
--
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
that
this
was
added
without
this
application
in
mind.
now
i
don't
say
that
–
i
am
not
saying
it's
limited
of
this
application
but
this
is
the
minimum
application
that's
possible
to
give
it.
now
as
to
why
it
might
not
be
rigorously
applied
and
for
every
purpose,
i
mean
say,
the
only
reason
why
--
i
don't
argue
that
it
doesn't
apply
in
other
cases.
the
government
doesn't
argue
that
it
doesn't
and
we
say
might
not,
and
what
seem
perfectly
reasonable
to
us
to
curve
out
exceptions
when
it
seems
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
consequence
congress
could
have
intended.
but
it
kind—
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
guess
i
have
to
drop
that
one.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
we
don't
argue
that
(inaudible).
well
right,
you
have--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no—
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
seems
to
me
that
this
kind
of
provision
that
which
seek
on
its
terms
apply
all
kinds
of
consequences
that
no
one
foresee.
suppose
he
voted,
a
naturalized
citizen
votes,
he's
later
denaturalized,
can
he
be
prosecuted
for
fraudulently
voting
because
he
was
not
a
citizen.
now
i
think
the
effect
of
the
denaturalization
is,
or
a
fraudulently
acquired
denaturalization,
that
is
voidable.
it
is
not
void.
it
does
have
some
status.
now
the
case
that
we
agree
with
is
the
case
in
which
an
alien
--
a
naturalized
citizen
leaves
the
country
and
returns
on
a
passport.
he's
later
sought
to
be
deported
on
the
ground
that
he
had
the
wrong
documents.
he
should
have
had
visa
--
an
immigration
visa
as
an
alien
when
he
entered,
that's
a
very
basic
reason
for
deporting
him.
now
in
that
case
it
seems
to
us
that
to
say
that
one
who,
this
route
--
in
part
it
was
always
involved
an
alien.
interpretation
of
the
interaction
of
several
statutes,
it's
not
simply
application
of
relation-back
provision,
and
to
say
that
one
who
holding
a
naturalization
certificate
uses
it
as
a
entry
right,
uses
it
as
a
passport
or
obtains
a
password
on
the
basis
of
it,
then
commits
a
crime
and
using
what
has
been
given
to
and
is
not
yet
been
revoked,
we
think
is
not
--
i
do
think
would
be
an
absurd
consequence,
and
i
don't
think
you
should
attribute
to
congress
absurd
consequences.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
don't
find.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
--
let
me
make
it
this
way.
what
(inaudible)
case,
probably
held
the
certificate
to
left
the
country
and
reenter,
and
was
later
tried
to
be
deported
on
basis
of
the
single
conviction
after
that
entry,
the
question
was
whether
that
was
an
entry,
so
he
entered
on
a
passport.
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
it
was
not
an
entry.
the
difference
i
think
there
i
would
distinguish
that
case,
and
our
case,
the
difference
there
is
that
leaving
the
country
is
for
an
alien
one
who
then
at
that
time
occupies
alien
status,
is
a
very
significant
event.
he
is
in
country
and
may
not
be
able
to
get
back
in.
he
can
be
excluded
for
grounds
other
than
grounds
for
which
he
can
be
deported.
there
is
nothing
unlawful
about
what
he
is
doing
in
any
sense.
and
if
on
the
other
hand,
contrast
to
that,
a
citizen
–
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
would
be
to
say
that
his
citizenship
is
void,
and
not
simply
voidable.
we
think
what
statute
means
is
that
it
is
voidable,
and
then
has
retroactive
consequences
if
it
is
voided.
now,
at
least
to
make
my
difference,
to
make
my
distinction
whether
or
not
you
accept
the
qualification
i
had,
i
still
think
it
is
a
different
case
because
there
are
the
alien
acts
in
reliance
on
his
naturalization
certificate
to
leave
the
country.
if
he
hadn't
been
naturalized,
he
very
likely
wouldn't
have
left
the
country.
what
you
mean
with
having
an
alien,
you
jeopardize
your
status,
you
may
not
get
back
in.
if
you
get
back
in,
you
have
an
entirely
new
status
here.
so
it's
a
very
serious
thing
for
an
alien.
for
naturalized
citizen,
it's
nothing;
he
can
go
and
come
as
he
will.
now,
in
contrast,
this
case,
what
mr.
costello
did
was
to
commit
a
crime
and
he
was
convicted
of
committing
the
crime.
the
crime
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
status
at
that
time.
it's
equally
a
crime
to
defraud
the
government
of
income
tax,
whether
an
alien
or
a
citizen.
he
would
be
equally
be
convicted
of
it.
none
of
those
grounds
are
influenced
by
the
outstanding
naturalization
certificate.
now,
certainly
in
that
case
we
say
the
relation
back
provision
should
apply.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
have
two
answers;
first
on
his
assumption
that
he
could
not
have
invoked
the
procedure
and
ask
for
a
recommendation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
on
the
assumption
that
he
could
not,
on
the
assumption
–
we
think
he
can,
oh,
yes
–
i
think
(inaudible)
for
doubt
that
one
holding
a
naturalization
certificate
who
is
convicted
can
ask
the
court
for
a
protective
recommendation.
he
doesn't
have
to
concede
that
he
is
an
alien,
but
he
certainly
has
the
power
to
ask
the
court
for
a
protective
recommendation
against
deportation
should
his
naturalization
be
revoked.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
suggestion
justice
goldberg
made
that
arguably
he
should
have
30
days
after
he
is
denaturalized
to
go
back
and
ask
for
recommendation
is
intriguing
suggestion.
i
don't
see
immediately
that
it
might
not
be
a
proper
result,
i
am
not
saying
this,
we
very
likely
would
argue
against
this.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
did
he?
no,
he
didn't,
he
didn't.
now,
in
costello's
case,
we
already
brought
denaturalization
proceedings
in
1952.
now,
those
are
the
ones
this
court
vacated
because
of
the
lack
of
an
adequate
affidavit,
but
we
brought
deportation
proceedings
before
he
was
tried.
we
brought
the
naturalization
proceedings
before
he
was
tried
on
the
income
tax
counts,
so
that
he
was
aware
that
his
naturalization
was
in
very
serious
jeopardy,
and
i
find
it
unbelievable
that
had
he
asked
the
court
to
make
a
recommendation
against
deportation,
because
he
might
after
all
be
denaturalized,
the
government
was
trying
to
denaturalize
him,
that
the
court
would
say,
we
have
no
power
or
that
this
court
would
affirm
such
a
ruling
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no,
only
the
doubt
of
outcomes
litigation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
it's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
litigation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
doubt
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
and
at
the
time
it
is
trial
for
income
tax,
it
was
absolutely
with
the
eichenlaub
decision.
so
that
it
was
but
for
a
possible
difference
between
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
who
may
here
--
i
am
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
54,
relation-back
was
in
the
statute.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
seems
generally
to
have
been
accepted
as
an
obvious
proposition
for
a
long
time,
well,
certainly
from
1932,
when
we
had
the
third
circuit
decision,
and
there
is
no
contrary
decision
other
than
a
couple
of
district
court
decisions
which
limited
it
to
actual
fraud,
but
they
didn't
turn
upon
basic
proposition.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
sure.
well,
those
are
--
that
had
been
resolved
before
the
trial.
the
eichenlaub
case
was
decided
in
january
54.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes,
yes.
this
court
--
they
are
litigating,
sure
they
are
the
litigating
challenges,
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
am
prepared
to
just
not
argue
that.
the
decision
of
the
immigration
board
of
appeals
i
think
in
this
case,
says,
that
he
could
have
implied
the
relation-back
provision,
which
surely
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
language
of
the
recommendation
provision
that
an
alien
may
and
simply
the
fact
that
he
may
become
an
alien
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
protective
recommendation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
it
doesn't
have
to
say
i
believe
that
i
am
an
alien.
he
says,
the
government
is
trying
to
denaturalize
me.
if
they
denaturalize
me,
i'll
be
liable
to
deportation.
therefore
to
protect
me
another
protection
i
ask
you
to
recommend
against
deportation.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
of
that
kind
of
request.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
proceeding
--
well,
in
costello's
case
proceedings
were
already
pending.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
i'm
only
telling
that
he
was
aware
of
the
possibility.
i'm
not
saying
that
he
has
to
assume
that
he
is
going
to
be.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not,
not
here.
i
mean
just
there
is
nothing
--
all
i
meant
is
nothing
surprising
about
standing
on
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
make
him
request
to
recommendation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
ask
for
--
it's
my
understanding
that
there
are
very
few
requests
at
all,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yeah.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
i
would
think
that
he
would
enter
a
conditional
recommendation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
say
that
there
isn't
a
question
of
interpretation.
i
am
satisfied
how
it
be
resolved.
if
that
case
were
here
and
we
were
arguing
that
he
can't
get
a
recommendation,
the
court
has
no
power
to
grant
it,
i'm
confident
this
court
would
say,
of
course,
they
have
power
to
grant
it.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
allow
the
judge
who
convicts
him
to
appraise
whether
this
is
a
kind
of
offense
for
which
he
should
be
deported
that
it
may
become
a
ground
for
deportation,
he
surely
become
naturalized.
we
don't
think
it
is
and
therefore
he
should
be
able
to
enter
the
recommendation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
on
eichenlaub?
as
our
first
ground
we
do.
i
think,
i
think
the
relation-back
provision,
we
would
answer
even
the
dissent
in
eichenlaub
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
yes!
the
case
is
really
exactly
the
same.
he
was
naturalized
in
1936,
convicted
in
1941,
denaturalized
in
1944,
and
then
later
sought
to
be
deported
on
the
basis
of
the
conviction
in
1941.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
based
on
the
1941
conviction.
now
that
statute
at
that
time
i
think
had
a
two-stage
(inaudible)
