chief

mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
did
i
understand
it
to
say
that
the
first
study
that
was
made
of
this
section
that
is
here
in
the
present
set
suggested
that
they
say
ever
has
been?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
this
question
if
the
original
study
suggested
that
or
pointed
out
that
it
should
be
that
way,
wouldn't
in
fact
they
didn't
do
it
that
way?
they
were
somewhat
on
the
fact
that
they
didn't
intended
that
way
regardless
of
how
subtle
were
–
(inaudible)
subtle
they
might
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
he
liked
subtlety
in
these
matters?
don't
you
think
that
senator
mccarran
had
probably
made
some
study
of
this
situation
for
him
to
introduce
that
bill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
we
governed
by,
the
report
or
the
bill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
are
arguing
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
mere
fact
that
they
didn't
use
the
same
tense
in
the
bill
that
they
introduced,
that
they
used
in
the
study
that
was
reported,
but
about
the
same
time
indicates
that
they
didn't
understand
the
difference
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
that,
what
do
you
base
that
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
i
get
report
all
right,
but
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
couldn't
you
say
that
they
didn't
–
well
the
reason
they
didn't
use
that
tense
was
because
they
didn't
want
it
to
be
applied
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
but,
they
did,
they
used
the
present
tense
purposely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
order
to
probably
to
make
this
analogy
during
the
eichenlaub
case
and
this
one
we
have
to
push
accept
you
affirmance
that
the
word
‘is'
means
as
saying
as
‘has
been'
in
the
future
maybe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
to
accept
that
in
order
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
make
the
analogy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we
will
recess
now.
mr.
barnett,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
go
that
far,
why
do
you
didn't
say
we
don't
argue
we
wish
to
emphasis
that
an
alien
whose
denaturalization
has
been
revoked
under
340
(a)
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
for
all
purposes
as
one
who
never
been
naturalized.
why
do
you
feel
free
to
carve
out
some
situation
and
still
maintain
that
this
dates
back,
but
is
there
everything
in
a
history
or
anything
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
added
it
to
the
bill
after
the
bill
that
we're
interpreting,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
they
did
argue,
you
said
it
would
be
plainly
absurd
for
example
to
argue
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
you
said
at
the
beginning
we
do
not
argue,
we
whish
to
emphasize
and
that
an
alien
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
you
go
on
to
say
it
would
be
absurd
to
argue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
it
for
that
reason
but
i
want
to
get
at
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
real
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
he
using
the
fraudulent
naturalization
certificate
just
as
much
in
this
situation
than
others
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
you
couldn't
get
it
unless
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
he
is
already
american
citizen
because
he
fraudulently
obtained
(inaudible)
so
where
do
you
make
the
mistake?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ultimately
he
asserts,
i
suppose
he
asserts
himself
to
be
a
citizen
when
he
obtained
the
certificate
through
fraud
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
could
not
–
