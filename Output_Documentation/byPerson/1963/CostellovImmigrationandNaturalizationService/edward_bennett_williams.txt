mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
i
can
perhaps
best
help
the
court
at
the
outset
if
i
review
in
a
cursory
way,
the
factual
backdrop
against
which
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
is
framed.
the
petitioner
was
born
73
years
ago
in
cosenza,
italy.
he
was
brought
to
the
united
states
by
his
parents
in
1895
at
the
age
of
four.
50
years
ago,
he
married
his
present
wife
who
is
a
native-born
american
citizen.
in
the
year
1925,
he
became
naturalized,
and
36
years
later,
by
order,
a
final
order
of
denaturalization,
he
became
stateless.
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
almost
forthwith
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
he
had
forsworn
your
honor,
allegiance
to
victoria
emmanuel
and
as
far
as
italy
was
concerned
and
he
is
concerned,
it
does
not
recognize
him
as
an
italian
citizen.
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
almost
forthwith
and
after
hearing
an
order
was
entered
by
the
hearing
examiner,
an
order
of
deportation.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
board
of
immigration
and
naturalization
appeals
and
a
petition
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
dismissed
in
december
of
last
year.
the
case
is
here,
of
course
on
writ
of
certiorari.
now
the
basis
of
deportation
which
was
first
ordered
and
subsequently
sustained
by
the
lower
court
is
found
in
section
241
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
where
it
is
provided
that
an
alien
is
deportable
who
was
convicted
of
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
after
entry.
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
as
the
record
shows
in
the
year
1954,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
a
case
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
of
two
counts
of
income
tax
evasion,
for
the
years
1948
and
1949.
it
was
a
dual
conviction
in
one
case
because
there
were
multiple
counts
in
the
indictment.
now
the
theory
of
the
government's
case,
in
the
income
tax
evasion
case
as
shown
in
this
record
was
the
net
worth
expenditure
theory
and
i
underscore
this
at
this
point
because
it
becomes
germane
to
our
position
as
it's
developed.
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
–
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
becomes
germane,
if
the
court
please,
because
of
prejudice
that
inured
to
the
petitioner
as
the
result
of
the
government's
instruction
and
the
lower
court's
instruction
of
241
(a)
(4),
which
i
shall
show
you
in
just
a
moment.
now
the
legal
issue
here
i
think
is
needle-sharp.
it
is
our
contention
that
an
alien
under
the
statute
is
not
deportable
for
a
conviction
or
convictions
during
the
time
when
he
enjoyed
the
status
of
citizenship.
it
is
our
position
that
there
must
be
chronological
coincidence
between
alienage
and
conviction
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
service
controverts
this,
says
this
is
insult,
but
in
any
event
even
if
he
be
right
in
construing
the
statute,
even
if
the
statute
lends
itself
to
misconstruction,
they
say
nonetheless
by
virtue
of
skill,
another
section
of
the
same
statute,
namely
348,
that
in
any
event,
a
denaturalization
decree
is
retroactive
in
effect
to
the
date
of
naturalization
and
citizenship
becomes
void
ab
initio,
and
therefore,
there
was
concurrence
chronologically
of
the
status
of
alienage
and
conviction.
we
can
say
this
and
argue
to
the
court
as
we
show
that
no
court
finally
passing
on
this
question
has
ever
held
that
the
denaturalization
is
retroactive
or
retrospective
in
application
for
deportation
purposes.
and
we
say
further
that
if
the
government's
construction
of
the
statute
is
the
correct,
then
there
is
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights
constitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
requiring
that
he
not
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
now
i
shall
like
in
normal
sequence
to
discuss
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute
per
se,
the
language
of
the
statute
with
which
we're
concerned
which
is
section
241
(a)
(4).
now
that
statute
provides
in
241
(a)
for
deportation
for
some
18
categories
of
aliens,
they
are
listed
seriatim
in
paragraphs
1
through
18.
in
paragraph
4,
the
specific
language
is
that
an
alien
is
deportable
anytime
after
entry
is
convicted
of
two
crimes.
now
it's
our
contention
that
that
language
requires
that
the
convictions
take
place
during
the
status
of
alienage.
the
congress
used
the
present
copulative
and
where
that
is
used
there
must
be
a
concurrence
time
wise
between
the
subject
and
the
predicate,
and
the
congress
recognized
this
because
in
every
instance
that
is
pertinent
here,
in
every
other
paragraph
1
through
18
where
the
congress
set
out
to
make
a
category
of
aliens
deportable,
it
used
both
the
present
and
the
perfect
tense,
saying
an
alien
who
is
or
at
any
time
has
been
since
entry.
for
example,
in
paragraph
six,
the
congress
says,
an
alien
who
is
or
at
any
time
has
been
after
entry,
member
of
the
following
classes
and
then
it
lists
a
long
category
of
subversive
failures.
and
then
in
paragraph
seven,
it
says,
an
alien
is
deportable
who
is
engaged
or
at
any
time
after
entry
has
engaged
and
then
it
lists
various
types
of
subversive
activity.
in
paragraph
11
it
says,
is
or
at
any
time
after
entry
has
been
a
narcotic
addict.
in
paragraph
12
it
says,
is
or
at
any
time
after
entry
has
been
the
manager
of
a
place
of
prostitution.
paragraph
14
is,
or
shall
have
been
convicted
of
possessing
a
sawed-off
shotgun.
15
and
16
is
or
shall
have
been
convicted
of
the
alien
registration
act
and
finally,
in
18,
has
been
convicted
of
that
section
of
the
statute
which
outlaws
the
importation
of
aliens
illegally.
now
if
that
were
not
conclusive
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
congress,
i
think
section
241
(b)
closes
the
issue
because
241
(b)
is
made
pertinent
only
to
paragraph
4
of
241
(a),
which
happens
to
be
the
very
paragraph
with
which
we're
concerned
in
this
case
and
241
(b)
which
is
an
indispensable
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
provides
that
an
alien
who
is
convicted
may
ask
the
sentencing
court
to
recommend
against
deportation,
and
if
the
sentencing
court
does
recommend
against
deportation,
he
shall
not
be
deported.
this
is
the
only,
241
(a)
(4)
is
the
only
paragraph
to
which
241
(b)
is
relevant,
showing
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
convicted
person
be
de
facto
alien
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
otherwise
of
course,
this
relief
would
be
meaningless
to
the
convicted
defendant.
now
of
course,
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
1954
this
relief
was
not
available
to
him
because
at
that
time,
he
had
the
status,
de
facto
of
citizenship.
now
fortunately
we
have
had
a
court
that
has
fairly
passed
upon
this
issue
because
it
has
been
framed
precisely
heretofore
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
gubbels
against
hoy.
now
in
gubbels
against
hoy,
if
the
court
please,
there
was
an
alien.
gubbels
was
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
gubbels
was
convicted
of
two
felonies
by
a
military
tribunal,
court-martial.
thereafter
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
and
he
was
ordered
deported.
he
sought
the
review.
the
case
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
he
claimed
that
he
was
not
deportable
for
convictions
before
a
military
tribunal
because
the
relief
proffered
to
convicted
aliens
by
241
(b)
was
not
available
to
him
because
he
couldn't
get
that
kind
of
relief
from
an
ad
hoc
tribunal.
the
government
at
that
time
did
not
quarrel
with
gubbels
position
that
241
(b)
was
an
indispensable,
integral
part
of
the
congressional
scheme
for
deportation.
rather
it
said,
gubbels
should
have
asked,
should
have
asked
the
military
tribunal
to
grant
him
this
relief
and
he
failed
to
do
so.
when
the
ninth
circuit
came
to
grips
with
this
problem
in
1958,
reported
in
261
fed
2nd
at
952,
just
to
say,
this
language
appears
at
page
2,
the
21
of
our
brief.
it
seems
plain
that
the
qualifying
provisions
of
subsection
b
are
in
an
important
part
of
a
legislative
scheme
expressed
in
subsection
(a)
(4).
while
that
section
makes
the
conviction
they
are
referred
to
ground
for
deportation,
it
is
qualified
in
an
important
manner
by
the
provision
of
subsection
(b)
(2),
that
if
the
court
sentencing
the
alien
makes
the
recommendation
mentioned,
then
the
provisions
of
subsection
(a)
(4)
do
not
apply.
this
extends
to
the
alien,
an
important
right
of
privilege.
no
doubt
in
most
cases,
counsel
for
a
convicted
alien
would
by
motion,
call
this
provision
to
the
attention
of
the
court
where
the
judgment
was
imposed.
it
also
seems
plain
that
if
a
military
court
is
so
constituted
or
its
procedures
are
such
as
to
make
this
privilege
extended
by
subsection
(b)
(2)
not
readily
available
to
a
convicted
alien,
then
it
would
be
a
fair
conclusion
that
convictions
in
a
military
court
were
not
contemplated
by
subsection
(a)
(4).
the
requisite
changes
being
made
of
course.
the
language
could
well
say
that
if
the
provisions
of
subsection
(b)
(2)
were
not
readily
available
to
a
convicted
alien,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
a
de
facto
alien
at
the
time
that
he
was
convicted
and
could
not
avail
himself
of
this
procedure
then
of
course,
it
must
be
contemplated
that
congress
did
not
intend
241
(a)
(4)
to
apply
to
any
other
then
de
facto
aliens
convicted
after
entry.
now
if
the
court
please,
in
its
brief--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
isn't
an
issue.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
two
crimes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it's
the
crime
which
makes
him
deportable
because
obviously
he
wouldn't
ask
for
the
recommendation
in
the
first
crime
because
he
wouldn't
be
deportable
for
the
first
crime,
but
the
second
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
sorry?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
in
the
second
crime,
when
it
appeared
to
him
from
the
statute
as
an
alien
that
he
would
be
deportable,
he
would
ask
the
court
to
recommend
of
course,
against
deportation,
and
if
the
court
would
pass
upon
it,
it
would
only
be
in
the
frame
of
reference
of
the
second.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
don't
argue
your
honor
that
he
should
profit
from
his
own
fraud.
we
don't
argue,
your
honor
that
he
should
profit
from
a
fraud,
but
we
do
argue
that
no
penalty
may
be
constitutionally
imposed
upon
him
for
a
fraud,
the
penalty
of
banishment
or
exile
without
notice
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
construction
that
the
government
contends
for
brings
about
that
precise
result
for
these
reasons.
the
government,
if
the
court
please,
as
i
read
its
brief,
does
not
argue
that
our
construction
is
a
possible
and
a
reasonable
construction.
i
don't
want
to
put
words
into
the
solicitor's
brief
that
aren't
there,
but
i
think
this
a
fair
reading
of
what
he
says.
he
says
at
page
9,
“we
do
not
contend
that
the
question
can
be
answered
merely
by
a
parsing
of
the
words
of
the
statute
or
by
bare
assertions
that
one
reading
or
another
is
self-evident
and
the
statute
permits
no
other.
the
process
of
interpretation
does
not
stop
with
the
words
of
the
statute
read
in
isolation.”
what
is
wrong
with
petitioner's
interpretation
is
not
so
much
that
the
words
cannot
be
made
to
perform
the
service
the
petitioner
demands
of.
now
this
court
in
the
case
of
fong
haw
tan
against
phelan
decided
in
1948
had
much
the
same
kind
of
problem
before
it.
in
that
case,
fong
haw
tan
had
committed
two
murders.
he
was
tried
in
the
same
case
with
two
murders
on
two
counts
and
he
was
convicted
and
he
was
given
two
terms
of
life
imprisonment
and
then
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
alien
who
fell
within
section
19
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
of
1970,
the
forerunner
of
the
one
with
which
we
are
concerned,
which
provided
at
that
time
that
an
alien
who
was
imprisoned
for
more
than
a
year
more
than
--
who
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
more
than
a
year,
more
than
once
shall
be
deportable.
fong
haw
tan
said,
“i
wasn't
sentenced
more
than
once.
i
was
only
sentenced
once
because
i
went
before
the
court
once
and
he
told
me
i
had
to
serve
two
life
terms.”
and
the
service
said,
“ridiculous!
of
course,
he
got
two
sentences
for
two
murders.
he
got
two
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
and
therefore,
you
are
deportable.”
the
court
in
resolving
the
statute
in
favor
of
the
alien
said
this,
“we
give
expression
to
that
view
by
reading
this
provision
of
the
statute
to
authorize
deportation
only
where
an
alien
having
committed
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
and
having
been
convicted
and
sentenced,
once
again,
commits
the
crime
of
that
nature
and
is
convicted
and
sentenced
for
it.
we
resolve
the
doubts
in
favor
of
that
construction
because
deportation
is
a
drastic
measure
and
at
times
equivalent
of
banishment
or
exile,
citing
delgadillo
against
carmichael.
it
is
the
forfeiture
for
misconduct
of
a
residence
in
this
country.
such
a
forfeiture
is
a
penalty.
to
construe
this
statutory
provision
less
generously
to
the
alien
might
find
support
in
logic,
but
since
the
states
are
considerable
for
the
individual,
we
will
not
assume
that
congress
meant
to
trench
on
his
freedom
beyond
that
which
is
required
by
the
narrowest
of
several
possible
meanings
of
the
words
used.”
court
said
precisely
the
same
thing
in
delgadillo
which
is
referred
to
there
in
brown
against
wixon
and
in
ng
fung
ho
against
white,
mr.
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
the
court
called
deportation,
“the
loss
of
both
property
and
life
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
against
the
danger
of
such
deprivation,
the
fifth
amendment
affords
in
its
guarantee
of
due
process
of
law.”
now
it's
our
contention,
if
the
court
please
that
the
construction
which
the
service
puts
upon
the
statute
vis-à-vis
this
petitioner
would
deprive
him
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
section
which
safeguards
his
right
to
liberty
and
says
“you
shall
not
be
deprived
of
it
without
due
process
of
law.”
certainly,
it's
of
the
very
matrix
of
due
process
of
law
that
one
be
apprised
of
the
consequences,
the
penal
consequences
of
his
conduct.
this
i
think
is
an
indispensable
part
of
the
basic
proposition
relating
to
due
process
of
law.
now
the
government,
i
contend
doesn't
say
that
our
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
a
reasonable
one
and
since
it
doesn't
say
that
ours
is
not
a
reasonable
one
then
i
think
the
statute
must
be
held
up
against
the
principle,
engaged
against
the
principle,
void
for
vagueness.
this
court
in
jordan
against
de
george
applied
the
void
for
vagueness
principle
to
the
deportation
statute
in
1951
and
said
that
it
was
applicable
to
deportation
cases.
again,
last
year
in
rosenberg
against
fleuti,
once
again,
this
court,
in
its
grant
of
certiorari
was
going
to
test
the
statue
there
involved
against
the
void
for
vagueness
problem.
ultimately,
it
decided
the
case
on
a
different
ground
avoiding
the
constitutional
question
on
well-established
principles,
but
in
this
case,
the
construction
that
the
service
argues
for
would
deprive
the
petitioner
of
very
basic
rights
because
he
was
prejudiced
as
a
result
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
statute.
had
the
petitioner
been
an
alien
at
the
time
he
was
convicted,
had
he
known
that
he
was
an
alien
that
the
statue
made
him
an
alien
then
he
had
several
courses
open
to
him
to
avoid
the
horrible
consequence
of
exile.
number
1,
he
could
have
offered
to
plead
guilty
to
one
count
of
an
indictment.
we
all
know,
i
don't
think
it's
inappropriate
to
say
that
this
court
might
judicially
notice
that
cases
across
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
nation
are
settled
in
the
federal
courts
everyday
by
pleas
of
guilty
to
one
felony
count
with
nolle
prosequi
of
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment.
if
he
had
known
that
he
faced
banishment
or
exile,
he
could
have
pled
guilty
to
one
count
and
avoided
the
consequences
of
a
dual
conviction,
or
if
the
government
had
been
obdurate
and
said,
“no,
we
insist
upon
multiple
count
pleas
in
your
case”,
then
he
had
another
course
upon
to
him
and
here's
where,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
question
that
you
pose
becomes
germane.
this
was
a
net
worth
expenditure
case.
in
a
net
worth
expenditure
case,
as
the
court
well
know
as
the
government
doesn't
attempt
to
show
precisely
how
much
income
was
made
each
year
because
it
usually
is
unable
to
show
that.
rather
it
shows
that
its
expenditure
has
exceeded
its
reported
income
over
period
of
years
and
it
seeks
conviction
on
that
theory.
the
defendant,
had
he
realized
and
recognized
that
banishment
or
exile
faced
him
for
duality
of
conviction,
might
well
have
waived
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment,
taken
a
witness
stand
and
conceded
that
all
of
the
unreported
income
contended
for
by
the
government
had
been
earned
in
one
year
and
that
the
expenditures
had
been
made
in
subsequent
years
and
thereby
obviated
the
possibility
of
a
dual
conviction
and
ensured
his
conviction
for
one
count
or
if
the
court
please,
he
might,
had
he
been
an
alien,
availed
himself
of
the
provisions
of
241
(b),
when
he
was
found
guilty
of
two
counts
and
asked
the
sentencing
judge
as
an
alien
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
exile
for
him.
the
judge,
in
the
case,
as
the
record
shows,
imposed
concurrent
sentences,
and
so
far
as
imprisonment
was
concerned
and
it
might
well
have
been
that
he
would
have
regarded
exile
or
banishment
as
a
cruel
punishment
and
an
unusual
punishment
in
this
particular
case,
but
this
opportunity
was
not
available
to
the
defendant.
it
was
not
available
to
the
defendant
in
the
tax
case,
not
available
to
the
petitioner
and
therefore,
he
was
prejudiced.
prejudiced,
i
say,
constitutionally
because
he
had
not
been
apprised
to
the
fact
by
the
language
of
the
statute
that
this
penal
consequence
flowed
from
his
conduct.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
you'll
find
them,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
pages
32
and
33
where
we
discussed
jordan
v.
de
george
and
some
of
the
cases
that
i
have
just
talked
about.
now,
the
pertinent
case
law
does
not
support
the
service's
position.
they
place
great
emphasis
on
the
case
of
eichenlaub
against
shaughnessy
and
say
that,
that
decision
by
this
court
is
authority
for
the
construction
which
they
put
upon
the
statute.
the
facts
in
the
eichenlaub
case
were
simple.
eichenlaub
was
born
in
germany
in
1905.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1930.
in
1936,
he
was
naturalized
and
in
1937
he
returned
to
germany,
to
the
fatherland
and
then
made
a
re-entry
the
same
year.
in
1941
he
was
convicted
of
violation
of
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
thereafter,
he
was
denaturalized
and
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him.
it's
very
significant
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
service
did
not
attempt
to
use
the
general
deportation
statute
to
deport
him.
it
never
asserted
that
as
a
basis
for
deportation
the
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned
although
that
statute
said
then
as
it
does
now
that
an
alien
is
deportable
if
he
commits
a
crime
within
five
years
after
entry.
his
crime
was
committed
and
was
convicted
for
within
four
years
after
entry
because
he
came
in,
in
1937,
was
convicted
in
1941
nonetheless
it
didn't
urge
this
as
a
basis
for
deportation
because
i
suggested
it
recognized
that
the
language
of
that
statute
was
couched
in
the
present
tense
and
required
concurrence
of
alienage
de
facto
with
conviction.
rather
it
went
to
a
specific
statute,
a
statute
passed
in
1920
with
specific
language,
which
was
aimed
at
aliens,
german
aliens
who
had
violated
wartime
security
of
statute
during
world
war
i.
now,
what
did
that
statute
say?
the
statute
in
the
eichenlaub
case
said
an
alien
is
deportable,
if
after
hearing
he
is
found
to
be
an
undesirable
citizen
by
the
secretary
of
labor
who
was
then
empowered
to
make
these
decisions
to
which,
aliens
who
have
been
or
may
hereafter
be
convicted.
and
the
supreme
court
speaking
of
that
language
said
the
statutory
language
which
says
that
aliens
who
since
august
1,
1914
and
then
it
italicizes
have
been
or
may
hereafter
be
convicted,
referred
to
the
requirement
of
the
deportations
be
applicable
to
all
persons
who
had
been
convicted
of
certain
enumerated
offenses
since
about
the
beginning
of
world
war
i
whether
these
convictions
were
had
before
or
after
may
10,
1920.
these
crimes
listed
were
not
crimes
in
which
the
conviction
is
dependant
upon
the
citizenship
or
lack
a
citizenship
of
their
perpetuators.
the
court
divided
four
to
three
in
that
case.
now,
with
the
statute
of
course
which
used
the
perfect
tense
talking
about
aliens
who
have
been,
it
didn't
use
the
present
tense
as
the
statute
with
which
we're
concerned
did,
yet
the
court
was
troubled
to
the
extent
of
a
division
of
four
to
three.
now
more
recently
we
have
a
case
fortunately
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
on
all
force
with
the
case
at
bar,
the
case
of
mangaoang
against
boyd,
a
case
that
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
certiorari
was
denied.
in
the
mangaoang
case,
mangaoang
was
born
in
the
philippine
islands.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1926.
in
1934,
the
philippine
independence
act
was
passed.
the
philippine
independence
act
granted
independence
to
the
islands
in
1946,
but
made
all
philippine
nationals
living
in
the
united
states
aliens
for
the
purposes
of
the
immigration,
naturalization,
expulsion
and
exclusion
laws.
in
1938-1939
mangaoang
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
thereafter,
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
under
the
internal
security
sct
of
1950
on
the
ground
that
mangaoang
is
an
alien
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now
the
statutory
language
of
the
deportation
section
relevant
there
was
as
follows.
“aliens
who,
at
any
time,
shall
be
or
shall
have
been
members
of
any
of
the
following
classes
and
it
lists
the
classes
seriatim
(c),
aliens
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
now,
in
mangaoang,
the
court
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
eichenlaub
case.
it
says,
we
do
not
think
that
the
eichenlaub
case
controls
here
for
the
reason
that
the
statutory
language
there
construed
read
quite
differently
than
does
the
present
act.
in
that
case,
the
class
of
persons
was
described
as
all
aliens
who
since
august
1,
1914
have
been
or
may
hereafter
be
convicted
of
any
violation
or
conspiracy.
we
think
the
language
here
under
consideration,
namely
aliens
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
was
intended
to
refer
to
persons
who
are
the
same
time
both
aliens
and
members
of
the
communist
party.
we
think
it
was
not
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
appellant
was
an
alien
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
some
prior
date
on
which
he
was
not
shown
to
have
been
an
alien.
so
the
court
in
the
mangaoang
case,
number
one,
said
that
where
the
language
is
in
presenting,
there
must
be
a
chronological
concurrence,
so
the
alienage
and
the
status
which
makes
them
deportable,
says
number
two
that
ambiguities
in
language
of
deportation
statutes
must
under
well
established
principles
be
decided
favorably
to
the
alien
and
it
says
number
three
that
it
will
not
accept
the
relation
back
theory
for
purposes
of
deportation
because
there
of
course
there
was
a
contention
that
alienage
is
related
back
to
1934
by
virtue
of
the
statutory
language
which
says
that
philippine
nationals
living
in
the
united
states
shall
be
regarded
as
aliens
for
purposes
of
the
expulsion
laws
from
the
year
1934.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
ninth
circuit
immediately
after
the
mangaoang
case
had
had
still
another
case
before
it,
resurreccion-talavera
against
barber.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
entry
in
1934
by
a
philippine.
he
was
convicted
in
1942.
he
made
a
trip
to
mexico
in
1952
and
when
he
came
back,
the
service
sought
to
deport
him
on
the
ground
that
he
was
excludable
at
the
time
of
his
entry
because
he
was
an
alien
who
was
convicted
prior
to
entry
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
and
this
is
what
the
court
said,
talking
again
about
the
tense
of
the
statute.
the
fact
that
talavera
was
a
national
of
the
united
states,
not
an
alien
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
of
the
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
is
irrelevant.
the
case
of
mangaoang
v.
boyd
relied
upon
by
appellant
is
indistinguishable.
mangaoang
was
ordered
deported
under
the
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
which
authorized
deportation
of
aliens
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
this
court
held
that
the
statute
in
that
case
required
that
the
deportee
be
simultaneously
an
alien
and
a
member.
the
statute
under
which
talavera
was
ordered
deportee
does
not
include
a
requirement
that
the
deportee
be
an
alien
at
the
time
of
his
conviction.
now
what
does
the
government
say
to
this,
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
we
say
is
the
reasonable
and
logical
construction
of
the
statute
from
the
whole
statutory
scheme
and
from
the
very
language
of
the
statute
itself
which
is
couched
in
the
present
tense.
it
says
well,
well
even
if
you
are
right,
even
if
you
are
right
the
language
of
the
statute
can
be
construed
this
way
you
still
lose
because
section
340
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
says
that
if
you're
denaturalized,
the
denaturalization
decree
relates
back
to
the
date
of
naturalization
and
your
citizenship
is
void
ab
initio
and
therefore
there
was
says
the
service
a
chronological
co-incidence
or
concurrence
of
alienage
with
conviction.
to
that,
we
say
this.
no
court
finally
passing
on
this
question
has
ever
related
denaturalization
back
for
purposes
of
deportation.
this
court
was
invited
to
do
just
that
in
the
eichenlaub
case
and
refrained
from
doing
it.
in
mangaoang
against
boyd,
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
refused
to
relate
back
denaturalization
for
deportation.
fortunately,
there
is
a
case
again
on
all
force
with
the
case
at
bar,
the
case
of
brancato
against
lehmann,
which
was
decided
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
1956.
in
that
case,
brancato
came
to
the
united
states
in
the
year
1914.
he
was
naturalized
in
1929
and
then
he
went
back
to
italy.
he
reentered
in
1930.
he
was
convicted
of
perjury
in
1932.
in
1937,
he
was
denaturalized
and
thereafter
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
alien
who
was
convicted
of
a
crime
within
five
years
after
entry,
the
service
taking
the
1930
entry
as
being
the
entry
relevant
to
the
deportation
case.
now
the
service
argued
that
alienage
related
back
so
that
when
he
was
denaturalized
in
1937,
it
related
back
in
1929
when
he
was
naturalized,
but
he
was
never
a
citizen,
that
his
citizenship
was
void
ab
initio,
so
he
went
back
to
the
fatherland
he
was
an
alien.
when
he
came
back
he
was
just
another
alien
seeking
entry
and
when
he
was
convicted
two
years
later
he
was
an
alien
who
had
been
convicted
two
years
after
his
return
to
the
country.
what
does
the
court
say
to
this?
the
government's
contention
would
require
that
we
give
the
statute
a
relation
back
construction.
we
have
no
difficulty
in
giving
a
retroactive
effect
to
the
denaturalization
order
in
view
of
the
authority
supporting
such
a
ruling,
but
the
government
has
cited
no
case
from
the
supreme
court
or
the
united
states
courts
of
appeal
which
has
gone
the
additional
step
and
given
such
relation
back
constructions
to
the
deportation
statute.
it
was
urged
upon
the
supreme
court
in
united
states
ex
rel.
eichenlaub
v.
shaughnessy
where
the
court
found
that
a
ruling
on
the
question
was
unnecessary
for
disposition
of
the
case.
we
think
that
the
court's
later
rulings,
the
supreme
court's
later
ruling
in
barber
v.
gonsalves,
347
u.s
637,
indicates
disapproval
of
a
relation
back
construction.
the
ruling,
ordering
deportation
in
united
states
ex
rel.
eichenlaub
v.
shaughnessy,
was
based
upon
the
statute
of
may
10,
1920
which
was
a
special
statute
dealing
with
sabotage
and
espionage
during
the
first
world
war
and
applicable
to
some
1650
aliens
then
in
custody.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
construction
given
to
the
different
wording
of
that
statute
is
applicable
to
the
general
deportation
statute
with
which
we're
now
concerned.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
was
saying
he
wouldn't
be
here
today
for
a
different
reason.
he
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
i
think
he
–
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
he
wouldn't
be
here
today,
to
tell
you
possibly
he
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
the
question
wouldn't
have
arisen
because
number
one,
he
could
have
taken
steps
to
avoid
his
deportability
in
1954
before
the
sentencing
court.
if
he
had
been
apprised
of
the
statue
--
if
he
had
been
apprised
of
the
fact
by
the
statute
then
he
was
going
to
be
made
deportable.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
he'd
been
convicted
two
times
and
–
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
not
given
him
relief.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
there
would
be
still
–
there
would
still
be
the
question
with
respect
to
–
oh!
if
he
had
never
been
naturalized
at
all,
you
say?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
alright.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
your
honor,
my
position
as
i
can
show
you
does
not
different
really
from
the
government's
position
with
respect
of
the
very
questions
which
you're
posing
and
i
want
to
show
you
what
their
position
is.
if
you'll
just
turn
to
the
solicitor's
brief
at
page
38,
there
the
service
speaking
through
the
solicitor
general
says
this.
“we
do
not
argue,
we
wish
to
emphasize,
that
an
alien
who
naturalization
has
been
revoked
under
340
(a)
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
for
all
purposes
as
one
that
would
never
been
naturalized.
the
relation
back
provision
obviously
cannot
be
so
mechanically
applied
without
regard
to
its
purposes
or
the
consequence
is
produced.
it
will
be
plainly
absurd,
for
example,
to
charge
a
person
who
traveled
on
an
american
passport
while
he
held
the
certificate
of
naturalization
with
having
re-entered
the
country
without
the
proper
documents
to
avoid
an
entry
fees
as
an
alien
because
his
naturalization
was
later
revoked,
citing
a
case.
a
closure
question
is
whether
a
person
who
travels
abroad
and
returns
while
holding
a
naturalization
certificate,
should,
because
of
his
later
denaturalization
begin
to
have
made
an
entry
at
that
time
for
purposes
of
establishing
deportability
on
the
basis
of
a
conviction
for
a
single
crime
committed
within
five
years
of
entry
on
the
basis
of
pre-entry
conduct.
then
just
going
down
two
sentences,
we
come
to
the
heart
of
the
matter,
to
the
middle
of
the
page.
that
being
so,
there
is
plainly
an
element
of
unfairness,
says
the
government,
in
holding
that
a
person
who
traveled
abroad
in
reliance
upon
an
outstanding
naturalization
certificate
and
that
thought
could
be
without
consequence,
in
fact,
made
a
new
entry
which
placed
in
greater
jeopardy
his
right
to
remain
in
the
country.
since
an
alien
not
holding
a
naturalization
certificate
might
well
have
refrained
from
leaving
the
country
rather
than
risk
of
consequences
of
a
new
entry,
such
an
application
to
the
relation-back
principle
would
not
merely
prevent
the
alien
from
benefiting
from
his
fraud.
it
would
in
his
sense
make
him
worse
off
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
never
be
naturalized
for
these
reasons.
the
decision
came
brancato
against
lehmann,
called
the
attention
of
the
court,
saw
which
petitioners
still
heavily
relies
on,
holding
that
coming
into
the
country
by
a
naturalized
citizen
is
not
made
an
entry,
while
it's
denaturalization
seems
to
worth
entirely
reasonable
one.
so
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
just
changing
the
language
of
the
government's
position
to
fit
this
chase,
if
we
started
here
and
we
said
at
the
bottom
of
page
39
since
a
alien
not
holding
a
naturalization
certificate
might
well
have
plead
guilty
to
one
count
in
a
felony
indictment
charging
him
with
multiple
counts
of
income
tax
evasion,
rather
than
risk
the
consequences
of
exile,
such
an
application
of
the
relation-back
principle
would
not
merely
prevent
the
alien
from
benefiting
from
this
fraud,
it
would
in
a
sense
make
him
worse
off
by
reason
of
this
fraud.
or
since
the
petitioner
might
well
have
taken
the
witness
stand
and
waved
his
fifth
amendment
rights
and
conceded
that
unreported
income
was
garnered
in
one
year
rather
than
risk
exile
or
banishment,
certainly
he
is
worse
off
under
the
construction
advanced
by
the
solicitor
then
he
would
be
had
he
been
an
alien.
and
the
same
argument
of
course,
mr.
justice
goldberg
can
be
made
with
respect
to
241
(b).
since
he
has
been
an
alien
at
least
he
would
have
been
apprised
to
the
fact
that
he
could
have
asked
the
court
to
recommend
against
deportation
and
undoubtedly
he
would
have
done
that,
he
is
worse
off
by
the
fact
that
he
was
naturalized
and
we
don't
say
for
one
moment
for
this
court
that
he
should
profit
or
benefit
by
reason
of
his
adjudicated
fraud,
we
take
the
position
of
the
solicitor
that
he
shouldn't
be
worse
off
to
this
extent,
we
say
that
a
penalty
of
banishment
or
exile
should
not
be
imposed
upon
him
and
for
this
fraud
without
notice
because
it
violates
the
basic
tenets
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
the
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
statute
seems
to
me
quite
clear
your
honor
that
either
the
application
must
be
made
within
30
days
by
an
alien.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
am
quite
sure
as
it
a
district
court
judge
would
say,
i
have
no
jurisdiction
in
obtainment
application
because
the
statute
(inaudible)
that
may
obtained
only
an
application
made
within
30
days
after
conviction
by
an
alien.
now
through
your
alien
now,
mr.
defendant
coming
here,
but
you're
too
late.
30
days
is
long
since
gone,
and
this
has
been
held
by
the
second
circuit
and
i
will
furnish
the
court
with
the
name
of
the
case
after
the
recess.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir
so
that
this
relief
was
not
opened
to
him.
so
it
seems
to
me
to
be
--
i
don't
use
or
want
to
use
the
overstatement
but
it
seems
absurd
to
say,
that
the
service
can
carve
out
of
this
statute,
a
meaning
which
says,
that
if
the
petitioner
happened
to
have
gone
italy,
if
this
petitioner
had
gone
to
italy,
and
come
back
in
1952
and
then
convicted
in
1954,
the
service
would
say
well,
it
would
be
unreasonable
and
unfair
to
deport
him
for
that
conviction
because
he
might
not
have
left
the
country
if
he
known
that
that
was
(inaudible)
face,
that's
what
they
carve
on
the
statute,
and
to
say
that
the
statute
lends
itself
to
the
construction
which
they
urging
recently
this
petitioner,
because
exactly
the
same
philosophical,
legal
and
logical
principles
of
day,
if
this
petitioner
had
been
apprised
to
the
fact
that
he
was
being
regarded
as
an
alien
in
1954,
he
had
these
myriad
of
courses
open
to
him
which
he
could
have
taken,
which
would
have
obligated
banishment
or
exile
to
him
in
his
present
situation
of
statements.
for
these
reasons
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
holding
the
lower
court
and
to
strike
down
the
order
of
deportation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
is
justice
white.
it
may
take
just
a
minute
to
say
what
my
feeling
is
on
it.
prior
to
1952
it
had
been
judicially
enunciated
several
times
that
a
denaturalization
order
procured
by
reason
of
fraud
made
citizenship
void
ab
initio.
in
1952,
the
congress
changed
the
language
of
the
denaturalization
statute.
prior
to
1952
it
had
been
that
a
person
could
be
denaturalized
if
he
illegally
or
fraudulently
procured
his
citizenship.
in
1952
under
the
new
act,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
he
is
denaturalized,
if
he
obtains
his
citizenship
by
willful
misrepresentation,
or
by
concealing
a
material
fact.
so
in
1952
for
the
first
time,
the
congress
says,
now
if
he
obtains
his
citizenship
by
willful
misrepresentation,
or
concealment,
it's
retroactive
in
application,
then
it
goes
on
to
delineate
very
carefully
what
the
effect
at
least
as
i
read
the
statute
of
this
retroactive
application
is,
there
had
been
a
great
bit
of
confusion
as
to
what
effect
the
void
ab
initio
concept
had
on
derivative
citizenship?
how
it
affected
wives
and
children
of
those
persons
who
were
denaturalized?
and
in
the
1952
act,
the
congress
was
very
methodical,
they
cleared
up.
it
said
this.
it
said
if
the
denaturalization
order
is
based
on
fraud,
derivative
citizenship
falls.
it
says
that
if
the
if
the
denaturalization
order
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
naturalized
person
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
various
subversive
organizations
within
five
years
after
naturalization
and
the
proof
is
that
he
was
at
the
time
he
was
naturalized
or
alternatively
if
the
naturalized
person
returned
to
the
old
country
for
permanent
residence
within
five
years
after
his
naturalization
showing
that
he
had
no
real
intent
to
stay
here,
then
derivative
citizenship
falls
for
wives
and
children
not
living
in
the
united
states,
but
does
not
fall
for
wives
and
children
then
residing
in
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
evidence
with
respect
to
the
relation
back
theory.
there
is
not
a
line
in
the
statutory
history,
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
suggests
that
he
had
that
in
mind.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
eichenlaub
came
down
in
1950,
the
year
1950,
this
was
in
1952.
now,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
am
right
about
the
date.
eichenlaub
came
down
in
january
of
1950.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
was
enacted
in
1952.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
at
the
outset,
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
a
question
about
whether
241
(b)
has
been
construed
to
require
the
alien
to
make
the
request
within
30
days.
it
has
been
so
construed,
sir,
in
piperkoff
against
esperdy
which
was
decided
in
second
circuit
in
1959
and
is
reported
in
267
f.
2nd
at
page
72,
where
the
second
circuit
hill
that
the
statutory
requirement
was
that
the
alien
make
the
request
and
that
the
recommendation
be
made
within
30
days.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
not
been
a
record,
it's
not
showing
men
involved.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
sir.
not
precisely
there.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
267
f.
2nd
at
page
72.
now
if
the
court
please,
mr.
barnett
with
his
customary
forthrightness
says
to
the
court,
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
determined,
what
the
statute
means
then,
and
if
that's
the
sole
criteria
as
to
what
the
statute
means,
then
the
service
is
out
of
court.
and
i
say
to
the
court
when
we
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
against
the
void
for
vagueness
principle,
certainly
it
is
the
language
of
the
statute
with
which
the
citizen
or
the
alien
is
expected
to
be
familiar.
there
is
no
fiction
in
the
law
which
requires
them
or
assumes
that
he
is
cognizant
of
all
the
legislative
debate
or
the
legislative
history
that
went
behind
the
statute.
if
you
read
the
statute
and
it
means
from
its
language
one
thing
to
a
reasonable
man,
he
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
that
and
if
he
relies
upon
it
reasonably
to
avoid
the
penal
consequences
of
the
conduct
that
is
(inaudible),
and
we
say
in
this
case
that
the
language
certainly
lends
itself
to
the
construction
that
we
place
upon
it,
the
government
doesn't
countervail
that,
and
the
language,
as
we
construe
it,
requires
the
concurrence
of
alienage
with
conviction.
now
the
government
in
the
relying
upon
the
eichenlaub
case
is
relying
upon
language
very
different
as
the
circuit
courts
have
already
found.
different
from
the
general
deportation
statute,
because
the
special
statute
in
the
eichenlaub
case
says
that
an
alien
is
deportable
if
after
hearing
by
the
secretary
of
labor
he
is
found
to
be
undesirable.
and
then
an
undesirable
alien
is
one
to
wit
who
may
have
been
convicted
or
hereafter
may
be
convicted
of
these
various
statutes.
when
the
ninth
circuit
considered
the
relevance
of
the
eichenlaub
case
to
a
case
where
the
verb
was
couched
in
the
present
tense,
it
said
we
don't
think
the
eichenlaub
case
controls
here
for
the
reason
that
the
statutory
language
there
construed
read
quite
differently
than
does
the
present
act.
it
goes
on
to
point
out
that
the
mangaoang
statute
was
in
the
present
tense.
and
again
in
the
brancato
case,
addressing
myself
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
the
language
as
in
the
case
at
bar
was
couched
in
present
tense
was
an
alien
who
is
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
more
than
one
year
within
five
years
after
entry.
not
only
did
the
court
reject
the
relation-back
theory,
but
the
court
did
not
say
that
that
language
could
possibly
mean
one
who
did
not
have
the
status
of
alien
at
the
time
that
he
was
convicted.
so
on
both
force
the
brancato
case
rejects
the
position
that
is
advanced
by
the
government
in
this
case
and
when
the
court
said
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion
the
ruling
ordering
deportation
in
united
states
ex
rel.
eichenlaub
v.
shaughnessy
was
based
upon
the
statute
of
may
10,
1920
which
was
a
special
statute
dealing
with
sabotage
and
espionage
during
the
first
world
war
and
applicable
to
some
650
aliens
then
in
custody.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
construction
given
to
the
different
wording
of
that
statute
is
applicable
to
the
general
deportation
statute
which
we
are
now
considering.
we
could
only
admit
in
context
that
whereas
we're
dealing
in
the
general
deportation
statute
with
language
couched
in
the
present
tense
which
requires
concurrence
of
alienage
with
conviction.
in
the
eichenlaub
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
language
couched
in
the
perfect
tense
which
did
not
have
this
requirement
and
of
course
the
relation
back
theory
was
rejected
in
the
brancato
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
1914,
that's
right
sir,
very
clear.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
what
congress
meant
with
respect
to
when
the
conviction
had
to
take
place,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now
–
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
brancato
had
a
certificate
of
citizenship
at
the
time
he
was
convicted
of
perjury
in
1930
and
thereafter
in
1932
he
left
the
country,
in
1932
he
was
convicted
of
perjury,
that's
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
five
years
later
he
was
denaturalized.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
the
argument
was
made
that
was
made
here,
he
should
be
regarded
as
an
alien
ab
initio
and
the
court
rejected
that
and
the
service
tells
this
court
in
this
case
that
it
agrees
with
the
position
that
the
court
took
in
the
brancato
case,
but
it
seeks
to
carve
out
some
esoteric
exception
that
seems
to
fit
only
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
says
that
if
costello
in
fact
had
gone
to
italy
in
1952
and
had
returned
believing
he
was
a
citizen
and
was
convicted
within
five
years
that
he
wouldn't
have
been
deportable
here
because
he
believed
he
was
a
citizen.
but
then
it
would
have
a
completely
different
interpretation
put
on
for
the
purposes
of
facts
in
this
bar
and
we
find
absolutely
no
support,
no
predicate
in
the
whole
history
of
the
statute
or
in
the
statutory
language
itself
such
discrimination
or
such
a
distinction.
it's
absolutely
banned
to
support
that
kind
of
distinction,
yet
the
service
recoiled
that
urging
before
this
court
that
denaturalization
should
be
retroactive
for
purposes
of
deportation
in
these
cases
because
it
recognizes
that
it
would
introduce
what
is
in
effect
the
imposition
of
an
unconstitutional
penalty
for
fraud
without
adequate
notice
to
the
alien,
which
is
precisely
the
situation
that
we
had
in
the
case
at
bar
and
which
is
precisely
the
prejudice
that
this
petitioner
has
suffered
by
reason
of
not
being
apprised
of
the
fact
that
he
was
alien
at
that
time,
that
he
was
tried
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
therefore
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
to
obviate
banishment,
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
put
in
a
defense
which
would
have
obviated
exile
and
finally
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
exercise
his
statutory
rights
under
section
241
(b)
to
get
a
recommendation
from
a
court
with
regard
to
his
dual
conviction
as
such
as
to
require
a
concurrent
sentence.
he
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
ask
a
judge
who
felt
that
only
one
sentence
in
effect
should
be
imposed
for
the
dual
conviction
of
asking
that
he
not
be
sent
into
exile
as
a
state
with
citizen
for
these
acts,
for
these
reasons.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
say
this
your
honor
that
at
the
time
that
he
was
before
the
sentencing
judge,
he
was
a
citizen.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
which
permitted
the
judge
to
make
a
recommendation
with
respect
to
a
citizen
convicted
before
him.
it
would
have
a
meaningless
statement
by
the
court
because
the
effect
of
241
(b),
your
honor,
is
to
make
the
recommendation
of
the
court
binding
in
final
and
if
he
recommends
against
deportation,
there
can
be
no
deportation.
in
that
frame
of
reference,
a
recommendation
by
a
court
with
respect
to
a
citizen
would
have
been
a
meaningless
exercise
in
judicial
language.
it
could
have
had
no
effect
whatsoever.
i
say
number
one,
the
court
could
not
have
done
it
had
been
so
disposed;
two,
had
it
attempted
to
do,
it
would
have
been
meaningless
and
number
three,
there
was
no
notice
on
the
convicted
defendant
that
such
a
request
was
in
order
because
at
the
time
he
was
a
citizen.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
denaturalization
proceeding
had
been
filed,
your
honor,
in
1952
and
has
not
yet
been
tried.
that
denaturalization
incidentally
ended
in
a
decision
for
the
defendant,
but
at
the
time
of
the
crimes
that
were
committed
here,
there
was
no
denaturalization
proceeding
then.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
exactly,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
until
afterwards
--
in
1957,
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
it
construed
barber
against
gonzales
as
being
in
disapproval
of
the
relation-back
theory
for
deportation
purposes
and
i
so
construe
it
also,
although
it
is
not
a
precise
holding
that
the
relation-back
theory
does
not
apply,
but
certainly
implicit
in
that
holding
is
the
disapproval
of
the
relation-back
theory.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
congress
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
exactly.
if
the
phrasing
of
language
of
340
(a),
if
the
pinpoint
241
(a)
(4)
and
say
look
we
have
the
word
is
here
which
requires
concurrence
of
alienage
with
conviction,
we've
got
to
do
something
about
that
because
we
want
to
get
these
fellows
who
are
enjoying
a
naturalize
status
as
a
result
of
a
fraud,
if
they
said
that
and
then
they
put
340
(a)
in
the
law,
then
we
could
assume
that
that
was
the
purpose
for
the
introduction
in
340
(a).
but
certainly,
the
legislative
history
of
340
(a)
not
only
does
not
support
that
construction,
but
it
supports
that
construction
as
i
read
it
and
so
it
would
been
simpler
i
think
to
simply
amend
that
the
241
(a)
(4)
and
say
here's
what
have
been
convicted
of
the
crime
at
any
time
since
entry
and
we
wouldn't
have
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
we
still
have
the
problem
we
had
in
the
eichenlaub
case
which
the
court
decided
in
1943,
but
we
wouldn't
have
the
a
fortiori
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case.
