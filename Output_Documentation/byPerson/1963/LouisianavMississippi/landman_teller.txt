mr.
landman
teller
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court.
it
should
be
my
object
to
show
that
there
are
really
is
not
here
alleged
a
permissible
or
legal
boundary
dispute
that
actually
that's
not
an
issue
before
this
court
when
you
properly
understand
this
situation
and
exactly
what
has
here
been
alleged
to
the
court.
just
as
mr.
carmouche
was
sitting
down,
he
says
that
an
avulsion
and
he
said
it
correctly
according
is
an
instance
where
the
river
leaves
its
bed
and
it
forms
a
new
one.
we
have
no
such
situation
as
that
here
involved.
we
have
here
a
case
where
the
mississippi
river
is
now
since
1812
has
been
and
as
far
as
we
know,
it
will
continue
to
be
the
boundary
between
the
states
in
this
particular
area.
and
if
this
court
is
going
to
fix
the
boundary
in
this
case
which
is
the
burying
thalweg
of
that
stream,
you're
going
to
be
fixing
the
boundary
from
day
to
day
and
every
other
case
up
and
down
the
--
well,
the
river
is
2500
miles
but
there's
not
that
much
difference
in
the
boundary.
i
mean,
for
instance
in
--
in
louisiana
--
between
louisiana
and
mississippi,
i
asked
the
so-called
expert
to
tell
me
the
--
how
much
boundary
there
was
from
the
31st
degree
of
north
latitude
to
the
33rd
which
is
the
place
of
common
boundary
and
he
said
that
it's
198
miles.
now,
i
don't
know
that.
that's
what
i
just
told.
they
all
in
that
area,
some
cases
whether
been
either
man-made
or
natural
avulsion.
now,
there
was
no
avulsion
in
the
duke
versus
durfee
case
that
you're
dealing
with.
and
here
is
what
we
would
like
us
to
get
before
the
court.
it's
--
it's
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
we
thought
it
might
be
of
service
to
might
give
you
a
little
map
and
we
put
one
up
here.
this
is
it
to
my
--
to
the
court's
left.
now,
we
attached
to
a
supplemental
brief
which
we
filed.
and
i
would
a
--
a
map.
and
this
is
the
map
of
--
the
original
of
which
was
--
was
reproduced.
that's
the
gray
document.
now,
superimposed
is
--
this
is
--
this
happens
to
be
a
1962
map
of
the
general
area.
superimposed
on
that
map,
we
have
a
point
called
(a)
which
is
the
head
of
the
cutoff.
now,
that
was
a
glasscock
cutoff,
which
is
shown
here
on
this
stream
map.
then
we
have
a
point
called
(b)
which
is
a
toe
or
foot
of
the
cutoff.
if
--
if
you
can
follow
me,
i
believe
we
can
get
this
--
we
--
we
can
accept
the
situation.
mr.
landman
teller
we
did
geology
in
graver.
and
it
--
it's
supposed
to
have
a
map
attached
to
it,
each
one.
so
that
is
the
foot
of
the
cutoff.
now,
below
that,
south
of
that
area
is
the
area
which
louisiana
says
is
in
controversy.
now,
if
you
will
notice
that
the
avulsion
took
place
between
(a)
and
(b).
it
took
place
in
this
--
in
this
bend
way
which
extends
to
the
--
to
your
left
or
west
on
the
map
and
went
a
course
of
16
miles
around
the
bend.
no
question
about
the
fact
if
that
was
an
avulsion.
it
was
a
man-made
avulsion.
and
it
didn't
change
the
title
to
anything
either
above
it
or
below
it.
now,
what
louisiana
is
here
saying
is
that
they
also
might
--
that
below
this
avulsion,
below
this
point
(b)
that
the
title
became
fixed
in
the
year
1939.
i
even
know
that
continues
as
the
mississippi
river
is
the
only
river,
it's
the
flowing
stream.
it
has
a
live
thalweg.
and
that
was
16
miles
up
to
12
miles
downstream.
that
--
i
don't
know
why
they
stopped
there.
they
could
go
on
down
from
new
orleans
if
it
was
--
out
of
--
going
down
the
state
line.
and
12
miles
downstream
would
be
down
to
the
water
bends
--
water
grimes
bend,
i
guess,
that
they
--
they
want
this
court
to
inform
the
master
to
tell
him
where
the
live
thalweg
of
the
stream
is.
mr.
landman
teller
as
--
as
a
result
of
the
cutoff?
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that
question
has
been
pretty
well
laid
at
rest
by
the
case
of
st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston
which
was
decided
in
1874
by
this
court
and
which
has
been
followed
in
the
jurisprudence
of
--
it
may
have
a
set
of
rule
of
profit
as
follows
on
the
jurisprudence
of
almost
every
state
in
the
--
mr.
landman
teller
that
case
holds
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
natural
or
artificial
just
so
long
as
the
intention
there
was
not
to
create
a
change
in
ocean.
and
actually,
there
are
reasons,
and
this
is
coincidentally
in
one
reason
we
feel
so
sure
about
position,
very
recently
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
had
occasions
to
deal
with
the
situation
in
the
bend
way.
mr.
landman
teller
i
would
think
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
that
louisiana
is
saying
that
they
have
a
vested
right
to
their
boundary
as
it
existed
in
the
year
of
1939
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
when
that
foot
--
when
that
--
mr.
landman
teller
and
--
mr.
landman
teller
and
then
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
they
say
that
the
--
that
if
they
were
entitled
to
a
vested
right
as
of
1939,
the
court
would
have
to
form
a
map
to
go
back
and
find
out
where
the
thalweg
was
in
1939
and
fix
that
as
a
permanent
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
as
a
result
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
of
the
--
of
the
cutoff.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
we
are
saying
that
the
thalweg
had
changed
it
because
of
a
man-made
cutoff
does
not
change
the
boundary.
that
thalweg
remains
a
boundary.
we
--
mississippi
is
saying
that.
mr.
landman
teller
no,
if
they
did
there'd
be
no
dispute
about
the
boundary
and
that's
what
i
want
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
then
i
--
i
best
--
mr.
landman
teller
as
of
that
date.
mr.
landman
teller
that
is
--
mr.
landman
teller
that's
right.
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
that
is
what
i
--
that
is
what
i
understand
to
be
their
position.
mr.
landman
teller
our
position
is
that
that
thalweg
is
still
there.
that
it
has
always
been
--
what
we
are
talking
about
below
--
below
glasscock
cutoff
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
is
the
mississippi
river
--
mr.
landman
teller
no,
i
don't
suggest
that
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
this
going
to
be
in
the
same
place
in
this
location
or
any
other
along
the
river
next
year
and
because
the
vastness
of
the
river,
there
is
no
(inaudible)
of
those
with
or
without
man-made
avulsions.
and
the
thalweg,
this
court
has
always
recognized
from
the
earliest
time
in
fixing
what
is
the
boundary
between
the
state,
not
only
in
the
mississippi
river
but
in
any
and
every
flowing
stream
that
the
mid-channel
of
navigation
is
the
thought
and
that's
the
very
line
remains
the
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
think
it
is
an
old
matters
of
jurisdiction
between
the
states
and
where
the
--
i
mean
to
get
a
distinctive
or
exact
line,
no,
i
guess
it
is
a
good
thing
that
you
don't
have
to
find
out
every
--
everyday.
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
that
is
right
and
that's
the
reason
it
does
remain
as
--
as
it
has
been
a
set
of
rule
of
property
for
all
of
the
years
since
these
two
states
have
been
admitted
into
the
union
and
since
the
--
since
the
union
of
the
united
states
has
been
formed
and
that
--
and
that's
what
it
almost
has
to
be
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that's
what
they
say.
now,
and
their
own
supreme
court
of
--
of
louisiana
said
in
this
esso
versus
jones
case
that
they
there
say
that
no
one
would
make
such
a
contention.
now,
when
you
study
that
out,
they
just
got
through
litigating
that
case
and
they
don't
--
and
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
pointed
out
in
dealing
with
this
glasscock
--
the
bend
way,
which
was
admittedly
within
the
area
within
the
--
is
bypassed
by
the
cutoff
and
was
within
the
area
of
the
cutoff.
now,
they
--
they've
said
there
that
that
line
changed
until
the
streams
ceased
to
flow
in
the
bend
way.
and
in
saying
that,
they
pointed
out,
they
--
they
adopted
the
rule
that
this
court
has
announced
years
ago
in
the
lovingston
case
in
1874
at
st.
clair
county
case
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
was
a
man-made
cutoff
or
a
natural
that
it
was
not
done
for
the
purpose
of
changing
ownership
and
that
the
resulting
effects
of
it
did
not
change
the
boundary
which
remains
the
thalweg
of
the
stream.
now,
that's
the
only
boundary
that
--
if
you
don't
have
that
boundary
would
you
have?
what
would
you
do?
how
much
more
confusion
will
result
if
this
court
says
that
the
--
the
mississippi
river
is
no
longer
the
boundary
between
the
two
streams?
mr.
landman
teller
no,
no,
i
am
not
because
it
appears
from
the
complaint
itself
on
the
very
phase
of
the
complaint
itself
that
that
is
the
issue.
and
if
it
be
an
issue
that
the
thalweg
itself,
no
--
what
mississippi
says
is
that
the
thalweg
of
mississippi
river
is
the
boundary.
if
this
court
says
that's
the
only
legal
or
permissible
boundary,
then
there's
nothing
to
appoint
a
master
thought
because
the
only
dispute
that
could
then
exist
would
be
on
which
side
of
that
admitted
undisputed
boundary
is
a
particular
bottom-hole
location
of
all
single
oil
well.
and
that
doesn't
present
any
dispute
between
the
states.
mr.
landman
teller
that
is
correct
and
we
are
here
now
--
mr.
landman
teller
not
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
way
senate
--
we
were
saying
that
--
that
on
the
phase
of
the
--
the
complaint,
that
no
cause
of
action
has
been
stated
for
other
than
the
thalweg
remaining
as
it
always
has
been
the
boundary
within
the
point
of
mississippi
river.
mr.
landman
teller
below
the
cut.
mr.
landman
teller
you
just
stated
much
better
than
i
do,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
--
to
get
across
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
only
boundary
that
you
can
--
that's
the
only
line.
that
is
the
mid
--
mid-channel.
that
is
crib
of
the
stream.
and
that
has
to
be
the
boundary.
you
can
have
no
other
boundary.
you
can
have
no
other
division
line
but
that
thalweg.
now,
if
you
would
take
this
thing
in
map
which
is
precisely
the
--
the
point.
if
you
look
down
at
the
--
at
the
bottom
of
it,
there
you
see
a
meander
line
of
1828-1829.
and
you
will
notice
--
mr.
landman
teller
alright.
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
that
is
correct.
and
--
and
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
if
that
--
that
is
not
true.
mr.
landman
teller
there
is
no
contention
that
happened.
this
--
this
complaint
alleges
that
in
1933,
this
ditch
was
done.
this
--
this
--
and
in
1939,
it
finally
became
sufficiently
open
to
be
the
--
be
carrying
the
mainstream
of
the
--
of
the
river.
now,
this
area
below
it
has
always
been
there
is
no
charge
that
--
they
say
that
in
1939
after
it
became
the
main
channel,
after
four
years
of
--
of
gradual
open,
that
they
should
then
have
their
--
the
thalweg
that
then
existed
fixed
as
upon
the
boundary.
now,
this
--
this
complaint
also
alleges
that
there
are
15
of
these
cutoffs
that
have
been
made
by
the
--
the
engineers
up
and
down
the
--
the
--
reaches
up
the
river.
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
sir.
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
sir.
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
that
is
the
contention
and
it's
--
mr.
landman
teller
we've
not
only
denied,
we
say
that
that's
not
legally
maintained,
that
that's
a
conclusion
of
the
plea
which
it
--
which
this
court
cannot
--
cannot
adopt
and
it's
in
the
position
now
after
properly
evaluating
these
allegations
to
say
that
they
cannot
adopt
it
because
this
is
talking
about
something
below
the
cutoff.
now,
if
the
results
--
if
the
resulting
effects
of
this
cutoff
that
--
that
is
if
they
are
going
to
stop
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
below
them,
then
we
no
longer
have
the
mississippi
river
in
--
in
practical
effect
as
the
boundary.
you
just
have
a
lot
of
masters
that
is
going
out
and
you'll
have
land
on
the
mississippi
side
that
belongs
to
louisiana
of
--
of
the
river
and
you'll
have
the
same
thing
up
and
down
--
i
mean
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
we've
been
here
a
long
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
been
--
been
--
well
after
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that's
--
it's
--
it's
not
my
theory,
mr.
justice.
it's
the
theory
that
--
that
has
been
existed
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
from
the
very
beginning
that
--
of
--
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country
that
the
--
that
the
main
mid
--
mid-navigation
channel
of
the
stream
is
the
thalweg
and
that
is
known
otherwise
as
the
thread
of
the
stream
and
that
furnishes
the
boundary.
and
it
is
capable
of
being
ascertained
at
any
given
time
that
it
becomes
important
by
the
(inaudible).
mr.
landman
teller
and
it
maybe
different
tomorrow.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that's
true
and
--
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
this.
after
--
so,
louisiana
gave
a
lease
to
this
area
below
the
cutoff,
12
mississippi
landowners
gave
a
lease
to
a
similar
area
because
it
had
been
to
--
it's
been
established
by
this
court
in
--
by
mississippi
courts
and
also
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
archer
versus
greenville
sand
and
gravel
company
that
the
mississippi
riparian
landowner
owns
to
the
thread
of
the
stream
to
the
thalweg.
now,
the
mississippi
owners
gave
some
leases
to
humble.
humble
and
its
subsidiary
carter
got
together.
now,
this
is
in
this
record
before
you.
it's
--
it's
all
attached
to
louisiana's
complaint
and
agreed
upon
a
line
and
this
is
what
they
said
and
they
announced
the
correct
law
and
--
and
so
agreed.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
read
from
--
from
the
quotation
from
a
portion
of
that
agreement
which
i
have
--
we
accorded
at
page
11
of
our
brief.
it's
the
one
in
blue.
“whereas
humble
and
carter
recognized
that
the
boundary
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
state
of
louisiana,”
i'm
talking
about
this
area
right
here,
“which
is
the
community
boundary
between
the
leases
owned
by
humble
above
the
scribe
and
the
lease
of
carter
above
the
scribe
is
the
thalweg
or
thread
of
the
stream
of
the
mississippi,
which
thalweg
or
thread
of
the
stream
is
subject
to
change
from
time
to
time
assort
to
the
natural
action
of
the
river
and
the
accretion
or
erosion
resulting
there
from.”
and
this
was
done
in
1953,
november
the
25th,
1953.
in
consequence
whereof,
the
boundary
aforesaid
separating
say
at
least
all
ownerships
will
be
subject
to
change.
and
whereas,
humble
and
carter
realized
that
the
changes
does
occurring
by
natural
action
of
the
river
in
the
thalweg
or
throughout
the
spring
and
consequently
in
the
boundary
between
the
states
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
maybe
sufficient
in
extent
to
disparage,
disrupt
and
embarrass
operations
for
the
drilling,
development
and
production
of
the
lease
and
may
give
rise
to
operating
problems.
it
could
impede
efficiency
and
cause
loss
or
confusion
in
a
sense
and
whereas
humble
and
carter
have
the
opinion
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
the
best
interest
of
each
to
agree
affection
to
each
with
the
other.
upon
an
agreed
value
to
separate
their
respective
operational
rights
and
ownerships
so
the
set
operating
and
only
boundary
between
the
parties
shall
remain
fixed
and
determined,
irrespective
of
the
true
boundary
between
the
states
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
at
the
present
or
any
changes
--
mr.
landman
teller
now,
that's
exactly
our
--
our
position
that
it
binds
nobody.
they
--
they
fixed
--
now,
they
could've
gone
into
--
to
--
they
could
have
--
they
wished
to
have
this
operation
line
fixed
as
if
--
as
the
line.
they
could've
gone
to
the
zucarros,
who
i
happen
to
represent
in
the
court
below.
they
could've
gone
to
(inaudible)
mississippi
owns
the
land
more
to
the
thread
of
the
stream.
and
they
could've
told
them
"now,
this
is
what
we
are
doing,"
but
they
didn't
do
that.
in
fact,
we
didn't
know
of
any
disagreement
until
the
zucarros
filed
a
suit
and
--
and
humble
filed
it
as
a
defensive
plea
in
connection
with
the
defenses
in
this
suit.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
way
it
happened.
so
--
mr.
landman
teller
sure.
mr.
landman
teller
it
is
--
it
is
my
understanding
that
--
that
that
would
be
the
--
the
case,
that
the
state
of
mississippi
would
then
--
would
likely
exceed
to
their
judgment
and
have
no
--
no
claim.
(voice

--
mr.
landman
teller
and
--
and
also
i
would've
--
mr.
landman
teller
all
private
--
mr.
landman
teller
i'm
a
spe
--
i'm
a
special
of
--
the
attorney
general's
kind
enough
to
appoint
me
as
a
special
assistant
in
this
case
for
this
purpose
and
i
do
know
that
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
--
of
mississippi
which
the
attorney
--
the
assistant
attorney
general
here
will
--
will
vouch
for
me.
mr.
landman
teller
i
don't
--
i
personally
don't
believe
it
would
mean
anymore
than
that
because
i
don't
see
how
you
could
speak
to
anybody
voting
for
what
he
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
if
the
thalweg
is
the
true
boundary,
that
there's
nothing
that
this
court
will
ever
say
or
its
master
could
ever
say
but
that
the
thalweg
is
the
boundary.
and
that's
just
as
real
boundary
as
--
as
can
be.
it's
just
like
this
court
has
said,
it's
a
monument,
it
--
it's
a
line.
and
when
--
when
the
court
appoints
the
master
to
fix
one
of
these
boundaries,
when
he
gets
to
the
thalweg,
he
wanted
for
more
latitude
down
the
thalwegs
to
another.
now,
that's
what
they've
always
done.
mr.
landman
teller
i'm
not
on
position
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
to
do
so.
mr.
landman
teller
i
--
i
didn't
mean
--
if
i
so
stated,
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
court
could
not
(voice

--
mr.
landman
teller
by
--
by
--
they
--
well,
if
--
if
the
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
if
the
thalweg
is
the
boundary
between
the
states,
then
the
court
would
--
could
so
find
now
that
the
thalweg
is
the
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
then
there
would
be
controversy
if
--
when
mississippi
says
that
that's
the
boundary
and
louisiana
says
that
that's
the
boundary,
they
ceases
to
be
a
dispute
as
to
where
the
boundary
is,
just
like
two
adjoining
land,
as
i
see
it.
if
you
reach
out
in
my
brief,
where
the
boundary
goes
to
the
creek,
well
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes.
mr.
landman
teller
that's
right.
mr.
landman
teller
i
believe
that
is
from
--
mr.
landman
teller
i
don't
think
it
makes
--
no,
because
i
don't
think
that
they
are
privileged
to
make
--
to
--
to
deliberately
maintain
that
position
because
the
law
is,
as
we
understand
it,
that
whether
that
cutoff
wasn't
--
wasn't
a
natural
cutoff
or
a
man-made
avulsion
if
it
does
not
change
anything
except
the
area
within
the
avulsion
itself.
it
does
not
result
to
change.
now,
there
was
testimony
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
it
is
not.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
of
course,
that
would
have
to
be
a
--
it
will
have
to
be
dissolved
by
evidence
and
held
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
held.
mr.
landman
teller
--
that
--
that's
how
--
how
radical
that
change
was
--
mr.
landman
teller
well
--
which
we
--
but
--
but
we
don't
--
it's
--
it's
not
--
it
--
it
is
nevertheless,
is
--
is
not
the
--
if
--
they
don't
charge
that
it
was
a
change
that
--
that
the
change
itself
was
not
imperceptible.
they
don't
charge
that
plainly
or
unequivocally
and
they
don't
mean
to
charge
it
because
they're
not
going
to
prove
that
it
wasn't
--
actually,
it
didn't
get
to
--
to
where
it
is
today
until
1954,
which
was
some
20
years
after
the
original
cutoff.
and
they
do
not
charge
that
anywhere.
it's
their
duty
to
charge
that
plainly
and
unequivocally
in
their
complaint.
they
do
not
do
that.
they
simply
said
that
--
that
any
changes,
no
matter
how
--
how
they
may
be,
how
imperceptible
they
may
be,
all
the
results
of
the
avulsion,
they
do
not
charge
that
the
--
that
the
change
which
we
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
would
still
be
making
the
argument
that
--
that
the
--
that
you
still
have
to
go.
but,
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
a
boundary
within
a
boundary,
that
the
mississippi
river
is
itself
the
boundary.
and
it
always
has
been
below
that.
and
if
the
thalweg
itself
shifted
in
there,
no
one
is
going
to
see
if
it
did
shift
within
that
boundary
that
it
would
still
remain
that
it
has
to
remain
the
--
the
exact
line
which
divides
the
two
jurisdictions
as
to
boundaries.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
they
--
they
--
mr.
landman
teller
they
say
that
the
change
occurred
as
the
direct
result
of
the
cutoff
but
they
don't
say
to
what
period
of
time
that
change
occurred.
mr.
landman
teller
well
--
mr.
landman
teller
but
the
point
is,
they
don't
--
do
not
say
that
that
movement
in
the
thalweg
below
glasscock
was
itself
a
precipitous
nature
at
all.
they
--
they
do
not
purport
to
say
that.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
would
even
then
--
i
would
--
i
would
still
think
that
the
mississippi
river
would
remain
the
boundary
and
that
the
thalweg
in
that
river
as
it
existed
and
as
that
river
may
change,
would
necessarily
continue
to
be
the
boundary.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
sir.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
--

st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston.
mr.
landman
teller
lovingston.
mr.
landman
teller
that's
23
wall,
page
46.
it's
--
it
is
cited
in
our
supple
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
no
--
no,
it
--
it
involves
a
man-made
ditch,
which
would
--
will
argue
this
having
changed
of
the
boundary.
it
--
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
landman
teller
46.
and
of
course,
they
are
just
innumerable
annotations
on
that
same
subject,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
--
in
our
supplemental
brief
in
--
in
one
study,
they
are.
i
believe
it
is.
but
--
mr.
landman
teller
130
--
mr.
landman
teller
that's
right
and
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
same
thing
because
the
accretions
are
going
to
be
--
mr.
landman
teller
i
really
don't
think
there
is.
i
think
that
it's
not
a
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
this
is
the
reason
we
say
that.
mr.
landman
teller
the
--
the
land
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
bed
of
mississippi
river.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
now,
it's
--
it's
not
a
question
whether
--
whether
the
land
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
we
claim
the
oil
well
is
now
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
thalweg.
mr.
landman
teller
because
thalweg
is
west
of
that.
mr.
landman
teller
is
west
of
the
bottom-hole
--
mr.
landman
teller
since
--
since
the
well
was
drilled
in
1954
according
to
--
mr.
landman
teller
louisiana.
mr.
landman
teller
no.
mr.
landman
teller
never.
mr.
landman
teller
not
--
not
during
the
time
that
the
oil
well
has
been
drilled.
it
was
a
directionally
drilled
oil
well.
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
that
is
--
that
there's
a
shifting
--
mr.
landman
teller
we
--
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
thalweg
that
is
the
boundary
--
mr.
landman
teller
there
has
been
a
gradual
--
there
has
been
a
shift
and
--
mr.
landman
teller
it's
due
to
the
operation
of
the
river.
there
have
been
causes
as
the
result
of
the
avu
--
avulsion.
mr.
landman
teller
no.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
now,
in
this
sense,
we
may
agree
that
--
that
that
is
what
changed
the
--
the
way
the
river
was
running.
and
--
and
i
dare
say
that
---
that
experts
will
readily
testify,
that
had
that
change
not
been
made.
the
--
that
the
channel
--
main
channel
may
have
continued
more
to
the
west
--
more
to
the
east
than
it
did.
we
can
conceive
that
that
evidence
would
be
readily
forthcoming
but
that
does
not
change
the
boundary,
which
is
the
mississippi
river,
and
which
is
the
main
channel
navigation
in
there.
mr.
landman
teller
no.
mr.
landman
teller
well
--
well,
not
specifically.
i
don't
--
i
know
of
no
shift
in
the
river
(inaudible)
in
occasion.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
in
--
i
don't
--
i
guess
that
mississippi
is
in
the
sense
that
the
zucarros
have
ascertained
--
mr.
landman
teller
the
same
thing,
because
--
because
that
--
the
channel
of
navigation
is
now
to
the
west,
all
west
--
mr.
landman
teller
to
the
west.
mr.
landman
teller
just
the
--
i
guess
it
could've
bee
--
suppose
it
did
result
from
the
--
mr.
landman
teller
it's
within
--
the
--
the
land
is
now
--
that
the
well
is
the
bottom-hole
of
that
well
is
now
in
mississippi.
mr.
landman
teller
that's
right.
mr.
landman
teller
they
--
they
claim
that
the
--
that
the
(inaudible)
fixed
as
it
was
in
1939
where
the
main
channel
was
at
that
time.
mr.
landman
teller
because
of
this,
we
say
that
there
has
been
a
shift.
we
say
that
the
river
remains
a
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
and
it
had
made
no
difference
why
that
shift
in
the
thalweg
occurred
from
a
natural
avulsion
or
a
man-made
avulsion,
that
the
thalweg,
as
it
changed,
change
the
state
boundary
with
it,
so
that
the
shift
was
a
natural
shift
in
the
--
in
the
state
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
is
a
question
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
yes,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
law,
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
landman
teller
what?
that's
a
question
of
law
which
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
it
that
the
--
the
complaint
is
so
clear
in
--
in
its
recitation
that
all
of
this
occurred
in
the
bed
of
the
river
that
all
--
mr.
landman
teller
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
landman
teller
and
that
the
thalweg
is
the
boundary
--
has
been
the
boundary
and
will
remain
the
boundary.
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
landman
teller
wherever
it
go.
mr.
landman
teller
from
year
to
year,
from
day
to
day,
from
time
to
time.
mr.
landman
teller
if
it's
done
--
if
it
--
yes,
if
--
if
the
resulting
effect
above
or
below
it
is
done
by
a
man,
yes,
as
long
as
that
bend
of
the
stream
remains
the
boundary
that
that
shifting
thalweg
remains
(voice
overlap).
mr.
landman
teller
i
think
the
same
question
would
be
posed
and
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
the
same
answer
would
--
would
have
to
result
that
the
thalweg
in
mississippi
river
as
it
existed
below
the
--
the
area
of
the
avulsion,
no
matter
--
whether
somebody
could've
find
or
not
to
find
as
it
came
(voice
overlap).
mr.
landman
teller
well,
as
we
understand
it,
that
--
that
it
is
--
that
it's
true
but
we
understand
that's
the
--
why
i
say
it's
a
reason
that
you
dismissed
the
complaint.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
massachusetts.
mr.
landman
teller
or
refused
to
--
to
let
them
file.
that
was
done
in
massachusetts
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
versus
missouri.
mr.
landman
teller
and
in
looking
at
it,
it
was
--
it
does
not
state
the
cause
of
action
then
that
is
a
ground
for
declining
to
permit
the
complaint
to
be
filed
and
that's
what
this
court
has
done
consistently
in
--
in
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
that
--
that's
all
i
could
say.
i
couldn't
say
anything
more
on
--
on
the
ground
that
it
states
no
cause
of
action.
now,
we
do
say
this
that
there
is
no
controversy
between
the
state
with
relation
to
where
that
well
is
because
now
the
zucarros
had
sued
humble
oil
company.
they're
asking
not
in
the
work
of
louisiana.
the
fact
that
humble
has
elected
to
suspend
its
royalty
payments
to
louisiana
is
--
is
not
a
--
a
reason
for
this
court
to
assume
jurisdiction.
if
--
if
humble
is
supposed
to
pay
louisiana,
all
louisiana
has
to
do
is
to
sue
humble
in
its
own
courts,
any
--
as
it
may
elect.
and
where
this
well
--
suppose
the
location
is
--
mr.
landman
teller
i
think
it's
--
i
think
that
the
boundary
is
a
crucial
issue.
one
--
if
you
--
if
you
say
this
court
was
to
decide
that
the
boundary
is
the
thalweg
as
it
now
exist,
then
that
leaves
no
dispute
about
the
boundary
or
i
will
say
the
well
--
then
it's
just
a
matter
of
--
of
ascertaining
a
fact
but
this
court
doesn't
have
to
take
jurisdiction
or
wouldn't
take
jurisdiction.
i
shouldn't
think
you
undertake
to
find
as
to
where
that
directionally
drilled
well,
where
it
is
found.
if
its
west
of
this
undisputed
thalweg,
well,
it's
in
louisiana,
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
mean,
that's
a
--
that's
a
mathematical
or
ascertainable
fact.
we
are
here
if
its
east
of
that
thalweg,
then
what
difference
would
it
make
to
louisiana?
it's
like
--
you
should
be
not
so
for
me
what
care
i
have
for
you'd
be
but
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that
maybe
true
but
--
but
it
--
it
would
do
--
it
would
--
that
--
that
would
be
so
but
it
wouldn't
present
a
dispute
with
the
state
of
mississippi
because
mississippi
has
taken
nothing
from
louisiana.
mr.
landman
teller
no,
i
don't
--
now,
the
zuccaros
are
private
citizens
filed
this
complaint
for
a
self-surfaced
trespass
and
--
and
that's
what
they
say
activated
this
cause
of
action
but
they
are
saying
--
mr.
landman
teller
they
would
get
no
royalties
because
they
have
no
ownership.
they
would
get
severance
taxes
and
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
they
would.
mr.
landman
teller
and
they
--
they
would
have
--
mr.
landman
teller
and
they
would
then
--
they
would
then
be
within
--
begin
to
regulate
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
well
and
there
would
be
a
--
a
problem
of
--
of
the
fact
that
the
well
was
in
mississippi
which
would
mean
if
it
the
(inaudible)
win
the
case,
no
doubt,
they
will
make
every
such
contention
such
as
that.
that
well
is
in
mississippi,
should
be
--
and
royalty
and
severance
taxes
should
be
paid
and
--
and
the
like.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
--
that
would
--
would
follow.
but
that
presents
no
dispute
with
the
--
with
louisiana
between
--
i
mean
the
claim
would
be
against
humble,
it
wouldn't
be
against
louisiana.
and
if
--
if
we
found
the
boundary
--
if
we
once
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
you
--
you
mean
--
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
river
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
don't
think
it
--
i
mean
once
the
boundary
is
at
stake,
then
the
consequences
of
the
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that's
right
but
--
but
--
once
if
--
if
the
court
--
if
this
court
determines
that
that's
the
boundary,
then
the
consequences
which
broken
my
determination,
no
matter
how
much
it
involved,
would
just
--
would
just
certainly
fall
in
place
as
i
see
it.
that
--
if
that's
the
boundary,
that
fixes
that
part
of
the
property.
and
--
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
the
--
if
--
is
that
--
you
don't
say
that
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
boundary
and
that
the
other
matters,
without
that
boundary
dispute,
do
not
present
a
case
that
justiciable
conquest
between
the
states
or
one
which
this
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of.
mr.
landman
teller
yes,
we
are.
mr.
landman
teller
because
we
see
--
well,
actually,
i
get
the
practical
consequence
of
that
would
be
that
the
parties
migrate
because
it's
going
to
be
expensive
to
these
private
landowners
to
--
to
try
this
litigation.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
why
the
court
would
--
would
want
to
stay
in
each
proceedings,
involving
of
a
--
a
disputed
claim
between
the
zucarros
on
the
one
hand
and
humble
oil
company
on
the
other,
especially
when
humble
says
that
they
agreed
upon
the
boundary
which
was
not
the
state
line
and
as
a
condition
to
that
agreement,
as
you
will
read,
they
were
cited
in
--
mr.
landman
teller
oh,
absolutely
--
it
depends.
they
would
have
that
--
mr.
landman
teller
as
a
--
as
a
condition
to
recover.
they
would
have
to
prove
that
they
own
this
land
and
that
this
--
this
oil
company
can't
directionally
drill
the
well
underneath
their
land
and
extracted
their
oil.
they
have
to
subs
that
tre
--
trespass
and
as
an
--
and
they're
see
--
seeking
a
monetary
judgment
from
humble
thalweg.
now,
there's
just
one
of
the
thing
that
i
want
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
it
would
even
go
to
the
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
and
they've
raised
all
kinds
or
forms
and
would
have
to
be
--
the
--
the
--
but
i
think
it
would
fall
--
that
the
case
would
rise
or
fall
on
that
determination.
mr.
landman
teller
and
i
might
point
out
that
humble
agreed
on
this
arbitrary
line
with
its
subsidiary
(inaudible).
they
recognized
that
several
units
that
they
have
been
informed
with
the
state
oil
and
gas
board
who
are
then
west
of
this
line.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
my
--
my
associates
won't
take
it
up
right
now
but
they
didn't
--
mississippi
didn't
even
know
the
--
the
suit
was
going
to
be
filed
until
they
got
processed.
so
they
couldn't
--
so
there
wasn't
any
(inaudible)
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
landman
teller
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
we
are
here
as
your
honors
will
find
after
you
have
an
opportunity
to
restudy
these
former
decisions
that
had
been
announced
by
this
court,
dealing
with
a
firmly
entrenched
rule
of
property.
one,
which
the
--
must
be
governing
millions
of
miles
where
boundaries
through
streams
divide
boundaries
between
property.
and
as
justice
brandeis
promote
in
one
case
and
most
instances,
it
is
more
important
that
the
applicable
rule
would
be
of
law
be
settle
than
that
it'd
be
settled
right.
however
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
it's
any
doubt
but
it's
not
only
settled
by
the
wisdom
of
ages.
but
there
is
settled
right
and
i'm
going
to
carry
a
moment
if
i
may
to
further
go
into
that
one
picture.
i
did
not
--
there
is
--
they
are
asking
for
a
rule
which
will
cause
the
court
to
say,
because
in
1932
they
--
(inaudible)
as
they
had
a
right
to
do
and
this
is
not
questioned
and
i
would
like
to
cite
one
case
which
was
not
cited
in
our
original
briefing,
i
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
if
i
may.
it's
a
case
of
gibson
versus
united
states,
166
united
--
u.s.
269
and
that's
a
case
which
recites
that
riparian
ownership
such
as
this
is
subject
to
the
obligation
to
supple
the
consequences
of
the
improvement
of
navigation
or
flood
control
in
the
exercise
of
the
dominant
right
of
the
government
in
that
regard.
and
that
the
--
when
the
government
does
this
works,
they
are
simply
asserting
a
right
belonging
to
the
government
to
which
the
riparian
property
is
subject
and
not
of
a
right
to
appropriate
private
property,
not
burden
with
such
servitude
to
public
purposes.
in
short,
this
court
has
held
that
the
damage
resulting
from
the
prosecution
of
this
improvement
of
a
navigable
highway
for
the
public
good
was
not
the
result
to
the
taking
of
appellant's
property
and
was
merely
incidental
to
the
exercise
of
a
servitude
to
which
our
property
has
always
been
subject.
now
people
own
lands
up
and
down
the
river,
know
that
they
can
gain
(inaudible).
they
apply
those,
the
states
require
it,
subject
to
a
paramount
right
of
the
government
to
develop
those
lands.
and
it
has
been
stipulated,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
agreed
on
a
number
of
facts
that
the
government
in
this
case
in
cutting
this
particular
cutoff
was
exercising
a
lawful
and
unquestioned
right
to
improve
navigation
and
flood
control.
now,
if
we
start
looking
to
cause
and
if
we
abandon
the
laws
of
accretion
and
erosion
and
just
say,
“what
is
the
--
or
is
this
going
to
be
--
is
the
land
going
to
be
affected
downstream
because
the
government
did
something
upstream?”
no
one
will
ever
know
what
they
own,
where
it
begins
or
where
it
stops,
and
this
case
is
an
example
of
that.
while
the
state
of
louisiana
--
when
they
came
into
this
court
and
they
--
they've
got
it
in
their
brief
that
they
filed
that
and
they
even
announced
their
desire,
i
distinctly
recall
but
i
can't
be
confirmed
by
the
fact
that's
in
--
their
supplemental
brief
they
filed
before
december
of
1963,
said
that
this
very
area
in
dispute
were
downstream
12
miles
that
the
effect
of
this
could
be
felt
12
miles
down
in
the
(inaudible)
bend
that
you
could
measure
them
that
far.
now
when
they
get
to
try
in
the
case
is
an
oil
well
--
we
can
only
measure
them
three
and
a
half
miles
because
after
this,
the
configuration
starts
--
calls
the
louisiana
to
gain
lands.
you
see,
this
is
not
an
accurate
portrayal
of
what
it
existed
if
they
say
it
just
accrued
now
but
it
is.
there
are
many
that
are
--
and
absolute
that
you
do
have
in
this
record
volume.
but
that
is
embarked
but
if
this
comes
about,
it
has
made,
it
has
tended
to
make
a
bend
that's
coming
in
this
way
and
going
out
that
way.
and
as
it
goes
out
this
way,
louisiana
has
gained
and
they
say
that
and
the
special
master
says
that
and
their
brief
admits
that.
so
then
--
but
they
want
this
court
to
stop
--
but
when
louisiana
stops
gaining,
(inaudible)
--
they
say
stop
right
there,
this
is
the
point.
we
can
measure
up
to
here
and
that
therefore
the
line
(inaudible)
before
somebody
else
comes
in
and
measure
it.
i
tell
the
court
if
they
will
change
this
rule,
you'd
have
to
have
a
special
master
going
to
measure
down
further
so
each
year
it
has
the
further
effect
that
cause
this
(inaudible)
here.
it's
different
that
it
would
be
before
--
when
it
wasn't
there.
i
mean,
the
flow
of
the
water,
the
consequences.
and
they
may
have
computers
that
it'll
be
able
to
measure
it
all
with
that
to
new
orleans.
and
they
will
say
in
the
future
--
a
few
years
come
up
here
and
say
why,
don't
fix
the
line
--
yes,
that
it
was
in
1932
and
1933
because
this
is
the
(inaudible)
cutoff.
so
this
idea
of
this
new
computer,
we
didn't
know
that
last
year
but
we
have
now
gotten
this
new
measuring
device
and
we
can
tell
you
with
positive
sentient,
these
people
who
just
own
lands
in
the
states
who
thought
they
would
boring
on
the
river,
states
who
had
the
river
as
their
boundary
no
longer
have
that
river
as
a
boundary.
it's
where
the
thalweg
of
that
river
happened
to
be
when
they
opened
the
glasscock
cutoff.
now
that's
the
reason
for
the
wisdom
of
the
ages,
that's
the
reason
that
--
that
this
is
a
rule
that
has
come
down
and
applied
(inaudible)
from
justinian
through
the
civil
law,
through
--
into
brocton,
to
the
common
law
and
louisiana
is
going
against
the
(inaudible)
of
its
own
supreme
court
in
this
very
meddle,
in
this
very
meddle.
there
is
a
case
of
esso
versus
jones
in
which
the
state
of
louisiana
was
a
party,
an
active
party.
and
then
will
--
which
involved
glasscock
cutoff,
this
area
from
y,
right
around
here,
stopped
there,
it's
all
--
further
it
went
because
what
was
involved
in
that
case,
there
were
accretions
up
in
the
cutoff
alone,
this
very
cutoff,
there
were
accretions
up
in
this
area
and
the
--
it
will
question
whether
the
private
louisiana
citizens
only
or
the
state
of
louisiana
and
there
was
some
more.
so
all
those
brought
the
litigation
on
in
that
case
and
as
they
said
why,
the
private
owners
own
the
accretion
until
the
water
quit
flowing
and
they
comment
citing
st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston,
their
own
state
supreme
court
of
louisiana
citing
that
case
said,
"well,
there
(inaudible)
no
one
would
be
foolish
enough
to
contend
that
the
law
of
accretions
and
erosions
was
repeatable
all
to
put
out
the
cutoff."
they
say
--
they
said
--
i
dare
say,
no
one
would
do
that.
but
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
mistaken
because
that
--
with
almost
concurrent
the
--
of
state
of
louisiana
had
determined
to
ask
for
the
fixing
of
a
permanent
line,
limited
to
an
area
of
three
and
a
half
miles.
so
we
say
that
--
we're
here
tampering
or
they're
asking
that
a
rule
be
tampered
with,
which
prompt
the
owners
throughout
this
nation
have
lived
with
and
know,
and
can
learn,
can
determine
what
they
own
and
what
they
don't
own.
and
these
very
parties
did
exactly
that.
this
cutoff
was
constructed
in
1932
or
1933.
louisiana
made
this
place
leased
to
humble.
in
1964
--
no
1948,
and
when
they
described
it,
they
didn't
described
it
as
in
the
line
over
here
between
b
and
x.
they
didn't
do
that
because
their
job
or
knew
that
wasn't
the
line.
they
described
it
as
downstream
along
the
mississippi
river
flowing
meandering
thereof.
and
at
the
humble
--
at
the
part
of
that
--
that's
where
they're
leased
to,
that
lease
--
then
humble
got
some
leases
from
a
number
of
people
in
the
mississippi
side,
13
in
numbers.
and
they
got
together
and
they
confected
an
agreement
and
that
said
agreement
which
is
the
reason
for
this
lawsuit.
and
they
said
on
november
--
well,
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
--
humble,
this
came
out
of
the
(inaudible)
as
humble
--
humble
put
one
of
its
experts
on
the
stand.
and
he
had
developed
that
he
had
studied
this
problem
and
had
made
a
report
to
his
superiors
on
march
the
31st,
1953.
and
in
that
report
and
i
am
virtually
quoting
it,
he
said
that
if
--
of
course
if
you
want
to
file
the
line
below
the
foot
of
glasscock
cutoff,
you
will
have
to
get
a
current
hydrographic
survey.
and
he
mentioned
that
it
was
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river.
well,
in
november
of
1953,
some
six-eight
months
later,
and
he
also
predicted
that
this
line
was
going
to
--
there's
going
to
be
a
development
favorable
to
humble
because
this
was
going
to
shift
more
to
the
west
and
that
is
an
evidence
before
this
court
as
humble's
exhibit
10
and
humble's
exhibit
11.
now,
they
did
--
they
went
and
confected
this
agreement
between
themselves
in
november
1953
and
on
a
recorded
document
which
they
recited.
that
whereas
the
thalweg
or
(inaudible)
of
the
stream
of
the
mississippi
river,
you
know
that
that
is
the
community
line
to
buying
the
leases,
called
it
from
louisiana
and
that
mississippi
leases
from
the
various
mississippi
landowners.
which
thalweg
or
rather
a
stream
is
subject
to
change
from
time
to
time
pursuant
to
the
natural
action
of
the
river
and
the
accretion
or
erosion
resulting
there
from?
now
that's
exhibit
c4
to
the
complaint.
so
they
knew
what
the
law
was,
the
law
they
deny
it,
can
this
court
to
change.
they
went
on
to
say
that
whereas
after
the
line
may
change,
that
it
may
embarrass
them
in
the
operations.
and
this
two
or
(inaudible)
humble
did
on
carter,
i
don't
know
what
that
--
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
but
the
agreement
was
signed
on
behalf
of
humble
by
mr.
davis
who
was
one
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
hugh
davis,
the
top
vice-president
and
on
behalf
of
carter
by
mr.
f.
m.
darwin.
and
they
said
that
that
they
were
going
to
determine
an
operational
line
irrespective
of
the
true
boundary
between
the
states
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
at
the
tip,
person,
or
any
changes
that
may
be
brought
therein.
so,
they
picked
it
up
as
between
themselves
and
that
was
a
line
to
which
they
drilled
when
they
elected
from
carter
they
get
to
drill
a
well
west
of
that
line.
so
then
it
was
the
boundary
line
was,
they
didn't
have
any
difficulty
in
knowing.
and
so
i
think
if
you
got
a
rule
of
law
that
people
know
what
it
is,
that
that's
a
pretty
good
rule
of
law.
that's
one
that
you
can
live
with
and
that's
one
that
they
were
able
to
get
along
with.
now,
there
are
several
things
that
they
--
their
exception
number
two
while
it
wasn't
discussed
much
was
that
they
have
--
except
to
the
master's
recommendation
that
the
only
--
that
this
court
only
decide
the
boundary
issue.
they
want
this
court
to
decide
the
litigation
between
the
(inaudible)
family
who
happened
to
own
section
11
in
mississippi
and
humble
oil
and
refining
company.
now,
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
original
action
to
let
--
to
determine
the
rights
applied
to
citizens
that
the
only
way
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
derived
from
the
constitution,
it's
original
jurisdiction,
this
can't
be
either
limited
by
the
congress
nor
extended
by
the
congress
as
far
as
the
original
jurisdiction.
and
the
appellate
jurisdiction
is
--
takes
by
the
congress
certainly,
not
would
govern
private
parties.
now,
we
have
in
our
brief
covered
these
features
and
i
don't
think
it's
really
--
i
don't
believe
it's
even
--
that
the
actual
jurisdiction
would
exist
in
the
court
to
try
a
damage
suit.
you
see,
this
is
--
that
is
the
way
that
the
matter
originated.
the
(inaudible)
family
who
owns
section
11
sued
humble
oil
company,
nobody
else
for
a
subsurface
trespass
for
the
taking
of
oil
which
they
said
underlay
their
property.
they
filed
that
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
in
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
that
was
done
on
november
the
27th,
1962.
the
answers
were
filed
by
humble,
just
any
number
of
defenses,
you
can
guess
otherwise
there's
a
estoppel,
there's
(inaudible)
mississippi
statute
of
limitations
that
this
court
could
have
--
would
have
to
decide
that
--
is
whether
its
leased
or
whether
it
is
not
leased,
there's
this
any
number
of
issues
that
--
or
in
that
part
of
litigation.
now
then
louisiana
filed
their
suit
saying,
“wait
a
minute,
the
thalweg
is
not
the
line
as
these
property
owners
saying
that
mississippi
--
that
we
understand
the
state
of
mississippi
to
believe."
but
it's
a
fixed
line
that
exist
over
here
by
reason
of
this
cutoff
and
so
they
filed
a
suit,
they
filed
a
suit
on
may
the
13th,
1963.
so
the
question
is
now
whether
--
of
course
that
--
we
recognize
everybody,
that's
an
original
action
had
between
two
sovereign
states.
well,
the
line
is
where
the
thalweg
happened
to
be
in1932
or
where
it
--
where
the
live
thalweg
is
now
as
it
was
when
the
states
were
admitted
in
to
the
union.
i
mean,
that's
what
--
what
it
was
to
begin
with.
now,
has
it
ever
ceased
to
be?
what
has
caused
it
to
ceased
to
be
within
these
latitudes?
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
must
--
mr.
landman
teller
that
--
our
opposition
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
and
that
the
only
reason
that
those
other
private
parties,
they
even
made
parties
originally
was
to
stay
that
litigation.
mr.
landman
teller
that
that
is
--
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
essential
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
to
the
--
to
this
--
the
court's
decision
because
after
all
it's
the
same
thalweg
that
divides
mississippi
and
louisiana
in
every
--
in
all
other
reaches
of
the
river.
i
mean,
it's
a
live
thalweg,
that's
the
way
it
is
between
the
other
states.
and
we
see
no
reason
why
it's
essential
for
this
court
to
go
beyond
deciding
that
one
issue.
where
is
the
boundary?
and
once
you've
done
that,
of
course
that
will
--
it
would
be
like
an
alternative
as
far
as
this
litigation
is
concerned
because
the
party
stipulate
that
if
the
present
time
the
oil
well
is
950
feet
east
of
the
live
thalweg.
mr.
landman
teller
we
say
not
--
mr.
landman
teller
we
say
not
mr.
justice
white
but
it
does
not
between
the
state
because
whatever
sovereignty
they
had
exercised
in
the
past
has
already
been
exercised.
we
can't
see
where
there's
any
dispute
between
the
two
sovereign
states
that
depends
on
a
past
or
historical
line.
you
know
that
the
exact
geographical
position
of
a
past
or
historical
line.
that's
happened
--
that
once
you
get
out
of
the
--
between
the
party,
the
litigants,
between
the
lew
carrols
and
humble,
is
going
to
make
some
difference.
it
may
make
some
difference
if
--
if
when
the
--
if
the
state
of
mississippi
starts
claiming
severance
taxes
from
humble
which
have
not
been
paid
to
it.
but
that
won't
be
between
the
--
it
won't
be
that
--
anything
between
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
mississippi
that
would
make
--
depart
or
make
any
difference.
now
we
--
mr.
landman
teller
what?
i
couldn't
hear
you
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
it
was
humble
who
elected
to
pay
them
and
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
would
just
give
louisiana
either
the
right
to
a
--
mr.
landman
teller
what?
i
couldn't
hear
you.
mr.
landman
teller
well,
it
may
be
that
humble
could
recover
from
louisiana
but
that
wouldn't
be
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
mr.
landman
teller
i
say
if
they
waived
it,
it
may
be
that
they
could
recover
but
i
don't
--
mr.
landman
teller
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
that
wouldn't
be
between
the
two
states
as
to
who
is
entitled
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
its
true
humble
has
already
paid
to
the
state
of
louisiana
and
it
could
be
that
mississippi
could
sue
humble.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
in
that
sense,
humble
could
be
subject
to
possible
double
liability.
but
i
was
trying
to
confine
my
answer
to
the
fact
that
as
between
the
two
sovereign
states,
there
is
no
dispute
or
controversy.
and
i
will
say
this
that
the
lease
on
file
shows,
you
impose
the
question
to
me,
supposed
it
have
waived
immunity.
well,
they
not
only
didn't
waived
their
immunity
but
they
didn't
even
give
them
a
warranty
lease.
they
just
gave
them
a
lease
without
a
warrant
so
the
--
i
--
can
i
--
i
mean
in
the
sense
if
the
question
is
theoretical,
they
did
not.
that
--
i
don't
think
that
lease
waive
an
immunity
because
it
was
even
without
warranty.
so
now,
we
make
the
other
position
to
the
--
we
have
the
other
point
that
with
reference
to
the
fixing
of
that
line
in
1954
that
the
master
--
we
do
question,
we
say
that
that
is
not
supported
by
the
others,
his
fixing
of
that
line.
and
i
wish
i
did
have
the
time
to
go
into,
but
may
be
i
--
first,
i
don't
have
the
ability
to
do
it
but
i
need
the
--
with
the
ability
i
have,
i
don't
have
the
time
i
would
say
then,
to
try
to
explain
why
we
feel
very
comfortable
that
the
thalweg
was
in
fact
west
of
this
well
location
at
the
time
it
was
drilled.
and
we
have
gone
into
that
in
our
brief
as
exception
number
b,
and
i
would
say
this
to
the
test
--
this
in
a
way
a
test
to
the
correctness
of
it,
they
have
--
they
didn't
respond
to
that,
they
didn't
do
it,
they
didn't
undertake
in
any
way.
it's
a
--
there's
a
yellow
copy
when
we
filed
our
exceptions.
we
attached
to
it
and
what
the
--
a
map
along
the
exhibits.
and
that
shows
--
actually
the
thalweg
is
the
deepest
part
of
the
stream,
it
is
the
flowing
stream.
coincidentally
in
1952,
and
i
say
coincidentally
are
very
fortunate
that
for
the
cause
of
truth.
in
1952,
there
was
a
special
governmental
survey
right
in
this
area.
now
the
only
reason
it
happened
was
because
there
was
this
--
it
was
--
they
were
in
trouble
then,
navigation
was
in
trouble
and
they
had
to
send
the
boat
joggling
down
there
to
dig
out
a
canal
on
this
--
to
scoop
out
some
of
the
channel
on
the
thalweg
so
as
to
get
it
free
from
navigation.
and
you
can
take
this
official
governmental
document
here
with
the
navigation
charts
which
we
have
introduced
into
evidence.
this
shows,
they
were
on
october
3rd,
1952,
the
government
actually
discontinued
what
had
been
known
better
for
as
dead
mans
crossing,
actually
discontinued
and
put
down
below
this
well
site
a
new
light
called
fairview
light,
now
that
was
the
passing
light.
and
if
you
will
go
by
the
governmental
navigation
charts,
in
all
that
you
will
find
the
thalweg
was
definitely
to
the
west
and
the
master
recognizes
it.
but
he
said
that
he
thinks
that
maybe
that
was
a
temporary
course.
mr.
landman
teller
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
one
that
the
evidence
showed
and
it
goes
through
the
dredged
area
there
and
the
part
in
the
river
that's
where
they
threw
the
(inaudible).
it's
a
much
shorter,
we
go
into
all
of
the
reasons
why
we
feel
that
that
is
the
proper
line
and
if
it
--
if
the
court
feels
that
it
is
essential
to
decide
where
the
thalweg
was,
we
feel
that
--
i
mean
first,
we
say
it
was
necessary.
but
it
is
necessary,
we
say
that
it
--
to
be
properly
done,
it
would
follow-up
this
line
and
this
evidence.
now
the
other
point
we
make
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
because
as
to
the
consequence
we
--
don't
even
said
it
was
necessary,
we
said
it
wasn't
necessary
as
to
the
controversy
between
the
states.
because
we
say
that
the
court
will
have
determined
that
controversy
when
it
says
no
to
louisiana
that
you
have
no
permanent
fixed
line
in
this
area
but
you
have
the
same
line
that
you
always
have.
mr.
landman
teller
the
live
thalweg
and
that
is
the
point
we
make.
the
other
point
we
make
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes
your
--
yes
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
landman
teller
the
lew
carrols
(ph)
suit
is
on
filed
on
the
district
court.
mr.
landman
teller
and
it
would
have
--
and
it
would
be
litigated
there
just
as
any
other
--
mr.
landman
teller
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
it,
no
states
are
party
to
it.
and
they
--
and
the
--
while
they
say
that
louisiana
is
a
necessary
and
indispensable
party,
if
they
all
are,
they're
going
to
win
the
case.
i
can
tell
you
that.
well,
we
don't
--
because
we
don't
think
that
they
are
one
but
i
mean
if
--
because
louisiana
will
never
be
able
to
--
i
mean,
the
lew
carrols
(ph)
will
never
be
able
to
make
louisiana
a
party
to
that
litigation
which
is
filed
in
mississippi.
mr.
landman
teller
and
--
mr.
landman
teller
well,
i
think
it
would
go
affirmatively
and
say
that
the
proper
line
is
the
thalweg
as
it
always
has
been
--
or
the
mississippi
river
in
this
area.
mr.
landman
teller
well
--
mr.
landman
teller
i
only
suggest
that
because
we
didn't
think
it
was
of
substantial
or
necessary
issue
to
the
dispute
between
the
two
sovereign
states.
and
that's
the
only
reason.
it
will
be
necessary
and
indispensable
issue
to
other
litigations
which
we
know
will
come
up.
now,
the
other
point
that
we
make
and
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes
sir,
sure,
(inaudible).
mr.
landman
teller
that
is
the
point
that
we've
make
in
the
issue
from
the
court.
mr.
landman
teller
we
suggest
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
it
should
be
confined
to
the
controversy
between
the
states
as
--
mr.
landman
teller
but
we
--
there's
a
stipulation
filed
at
the
--
mr.
landman
teller
--
exhibit
c
to
the
--
stipulated
october
26,
1964.
now
i
say
one
other
thing
for
--
to
show
how
well
we
knew
how
to
agree
on
thalwegs,
we
agreed
on
every
other
one
except
the
1952.
mr.
landman
teller
and
i
think
that
you'll
find
--
mr.
landman
teller
yes.
well,
of
course
that's
right
but
you'll
find
that
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
agreed
on
was
not
because
mississippi
departed
from
the
rationale
and
the
rules
that
were
applicable,
but
because
louisiana
was
unwilling
to
do
so.
they
wanted
to
adopt
a
sailing
line
which
was
eliminated
on
the
very
date
--
which
was
the
cause
--
let's
say,
there
being
made
and
was
eliminated
on
that
date.
now
the
other
point
that
we
have
to
make
and
i
--
which
will
make
an
exception
to
and
it's
covered
in
our
briefs,
i
hope
they're
able
to
--
what
is
pertains
to
the
courts.
and
we
know
that
usually
cause
are
assessed
or
divided
equally
but
we
have
reason
that
we
feel
that
all
of
the
cause
in
this
matter
should
be
assessed
again
louisiana
and
we
have
assigned
those
briefs.
i
certainly
thank
the
court
for
your
kind
attention.
